1
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:39,474
Head cocked to the left...

2
00:01:39,642 --> 00:01:41,434
partial deafness in ear.

3
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:42,852
First point of attack.

4
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:47,649
Two, throat. Paralyze vocal cords.
Stop screaming.

5
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:51,820
Three, got to be heavy drinker.
Floating rib to the liver.

6
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:55,365
Four, finally, dragging left leg.
Fist to patella.

7
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:59,035
Summary of prognosis,
conscious in 90 seconds.

8
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:00,912
Martial efficacy, quarter of an hour.

9
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,665
Full faculty recovery, unlikely.

10
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,239
I like the hat.

11
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:19,908
I just picked it up.

12
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:21,826
Did you remember your revolver?

13
00:03:21,994 --> 00:03:23,244
Knew I forgot something.

14
00:03:23,913 --> 00:03:26,623
- Thought I'd left the stove on.
- You did.

15
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:31,085
I think that's quite enough.

16
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:33,087
You are a doctor, after all.

17
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,803
Always nice to see you, Watson.

18
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:45,183
Where's the inspector?

19
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,602
He's getting his troops lined up.

20
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,103
That could be all day.

21
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:48,955
Sherlock Holmes.

22
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,458
And his loyal dog.

23
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:54,377
Tell me, doctor...

24
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:57,380
as a medical man,
have you enjoyed my work?

25
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:00,133
Let me show you
how much I've enjoyed it.

26
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:02,468
Watson. Don't.

27
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,349
Observe.

28
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:13,104
How did you see that?

29
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:14,647
Because I was looking for it.

30
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:21,571
Lord Blackwood.

31
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:23,906
You seem surprised.

32
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:27,577
I'd say the girl deserves your attention
more than he.

33
00:05:28,746 --> 00:05:30,538
Indeed.

34
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:38,421
Oh, I'd leave that alone
if I were you, boy-o.

35
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:40,590
Good lad.

36
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:43,009
Impeccable timing, Lestrade.

37
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:45,762
We've one for the doctor...

38
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:47,430
and one for the rope.

39
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:49,390
- Clarkie?
- Sir?

40
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:51,434
This woman needs a hospital
immediately.

41
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:53,227
Put her in the back of the Moriah.

42
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:54,854
Right, lads. That's it.

43
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:00,735
- Right. Pick him up, lads.
- Yes, sir.

44
00:06:00,903 --> 00:06:02,820
If you don't mind.

45
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:05,740
Get him out of my sight.

46
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,456
And you were supposed to
wait for my orders.

47
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:18,878
If I had, you'd be cleaning up a corpse
and chasing a rumor.

48
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:21,964
Besides, the girl's parents hired me,
not the Yard.

49
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:24,967
Why they thought you'd require
any assistance is beyond me.

50
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:27,804
Well, London will breathe a sigh of relief.

51
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:30,139
Indeed. Congratulations, Lestrade.

52
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:32,975
Bravo, inspector. Have a cigar.

53
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:34,477
Gentlemen.

54
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:35,853
Cheese.

55
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,677
Blackwood hangs tomorrow.
Read all about it.

56
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:15,685
156 over 80. Very good.

57
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:19,313
My nerves are the best they've been
in years, thanks to you.

58
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:20,898
Tell me something.

59
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:23,067
Your new premises...

60
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:24,485
when are you moving in?

61
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:26,487
I should be in within the week.

62
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:30,032
Cavendish Place.
And there'll be a woman's touch too.

63
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,617
- Well, that's marvelous.
- Indeed.

64
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,246
Good God.

65
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:38,332
- That was gunfire.
- No.

66
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,586
No, no. Hammer and nail, wasn't it?

67
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:45,006
My colleague's probably
just putting up a painting.

68
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:47,383
I'll... I'll go and check.

69
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:49,510
- Your colleague...
- Yes?

70
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:52,054
Won't be moving with you, will he?

71
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:54,348
No, he won't.

72
00:07:56,727 --> 00:07:58,102
Mrs. Hudson.

73
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,855
I won't go in,
not while he's got a gun in his hand.

74
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,732
You don't have to. Give me the paper.

75
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,485
What'll I do when you leave, doctor?
He'll have the whole house down.

76
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,529
He just needs another case. That's all.

77
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:10,781
Couldn't you have a longer engagement?

78
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:14,368
I smell gunpowder. It's not right, you
know, not in a domestic environment.

79
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:19,040
Thank you, Captain Philips.
Perhaps a nice cup of tea?

80
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,835
- Same time next week.
- Come along, captain.

81
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,254
- It's quieter downstairs.
- Mrs. Hudson?

82
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:26,923
Bring something to cheer him up.

83
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:39,393
Permission to enter the armory?

84
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:40,603
Granted.

85
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:46,525
Watson, I am in the process
of inventing a device...

86
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,694
that suppresses the sound
of a gunshot.

87
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:54,033
It's not working.

88
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:55,826
Can I see that?

89
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:06,128
You know, it's been three months...

90
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:08,589
since your last case.

91
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:13,634
Yes, yes. Gently, gently, Watson.
Be gentle with me...

92
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,225
Don't you think it's time
you found another one?

93
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,645
I can't but agree.

94
00:09:22,813 --> 00:09:26,399
My mind rebels at stagnation.
Give me problems. Give me work.

95
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,192
The sooner, the better.

96
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:30,111
Paper.

97
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:33,990
Let's see, then. There's a letter here...

98
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:37,451
from Mrs. Ramsey of Queen's Park.

99
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:41,163
- Her husband's disappeared.
- He's in Belgium with the scullery maid.

100
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:42,957
Is it November?

101
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:45,751
Yes, Holmes. All right.

102
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,713
Lady Radford reports...

103
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,090
Oh, her emerald bracelet
has disappeared.

104
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:55,553
Insurance swindle. Lord Radford
likes fast women and slow ponies.

105
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:59,432
I see you're the attending physician
at Blackwood's hanging.

106
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,641
Yes.

107
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:04,395
It was our last case together
and I wanted to see it through to the end.

108
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:12,737
A Mr. Lewis is seeking...

109
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:15,614
There's only one case
that intrigues me at present:

110
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:19,869
The curious case of Mrs. Hudson,
the absentee landlady.

111
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:22,079
I've been studying
her comings and goings.

112
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:24,373
They appear most sinister.

113
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,208
Tea, Mr. Holmes?

114
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:27,668
Is it poisoned, nanny?

115
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:30,171
There's enough of that in you already.

116
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:32,882
Don't touch.
Everything is in its proper place...

117
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,384
as per usual, nanny.

118
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:38,721
He's killed the dog. Again.

119
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:41,265
What have you done to Gladstone now?

120
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:44,560
I was simply testing a new anesthetic.

121
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:46,395
He doesn't mind.

122
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:50,649
Holmes, as your doctor...

123
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:55,029
- He'll be as right as a trivet in no time.
- As your friend...

124
00:10:55,197 --> 00:10:59,241
you've been in this room for two weeks.
I insist, you have to get out.

125
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:03,496
There's nothing of interest for me
out there, on earth, at all.

126
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:07,249
- You're free this evening?
- Absolutely.

127
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,668
- Dinner? The Royale?
- Wonderful. My favorite.

128
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:11,379
Mary's coming.

129
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:15,466
- Not available.
- You're meeting her, Holmes.

130
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,511
Have you proposed yet?

131
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:22,723
- No, I haven't found the right ring.
- Then it's not official.

132
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:25,017
It's happening, whether you like it or not.

133
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,269
8:30, the Royale. Wear a jacket.

134
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:28,979
You wear a jacket.

135
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:45,371
A man? Outside my house?

136
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:53,879
Straighten your tie.

137
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:06,642
Holmes.

138
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:08,769
You're early.

139
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:11,647
Fashionably.

140
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:13,816
Miss Mary Morstan.

141
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:16,318
My goodness. What a pleasure.

142
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:20,114
I don't know why it's taken him so long
to introduce us properly.

143
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:21,657
Pleasure is mine.

144
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,915
It really is quite a thrill to meet you,
Mr. Holmes.

145
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,042
I've heard so much about you.

146
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:34,545
I have a pile of detective novels at home.

147
00:12:34,713 --> 00:12:36,922
- Wilkie Collins, Poe.
- It's true.

148
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,592
It can seem a little far-fetched
though sometimes...

149
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:42,511
making grand assumptions
out of tiny details.

150
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,472
That's not quite right, is it?

151
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:47,600
In fact, the little details
are by far the most important.

152
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:53,481
- Take Watson.
- I intend to.

153
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:59,069
See his walking stick?
A rare African snakewood...

154
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:01,697
hiding a blade of high-tensile steel.

155
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:05,326
A few were awarded
to veterans of the Afghan war...

156
00:13:05,494 --> 00:13:07,536
so I can assume
he's a decorated soldier.

157
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:10,706
Strong, brave,
born to be a man of action.

158
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:13,542
And neat, like all military men.

159
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,670
Now, I check his pockets.

160
00:13:17,506 --> 00:13:22,218
A stub from a boxing match. Now I
can infer that he's a bit of a gambler.

161
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:24,053
I'd keep an eye on that dowry.

162
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:26,555
- Those days are behind me.
- Right behind you.

163
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:28,557
He's cost us the rent more than once.

164
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:32,394
Well, with all due respect, Mr. Holmes,
you know John very well.

165
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:35,064
What about a complete stranger?

166
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:37,983
- What can you tell about me?
- You?

167
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,751
- I don't think...
- I don't know that...

168
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:41,172
- Not at dinner.
- Some other time.

169
00:13:41,196 --> 00:13:42,321
- I insist.
- You insist?

170
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:45,574
- You remember we discussed this.
- The lady insists.

171
00:13:51,957 --> 00:13:53,457
- You're a governess.
- Well done.

172
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,251
Yes, well done. Shall we...?

173
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:57,711
- Waiter?
- Your student...

174
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,213
is a boy of 8.

175
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:02,258
- Charlie's 7, actually.
- Charlie, huh?

176
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:05,261
Then he's tall for his age.
He flicked ink at you today.

177
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:07,012
Is there ink on my face?

178
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,098
There's nothing wrong with your face.

179
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:11,225
There are two drops on your ear, in fact.

180
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:13,561
India blue's nearly impossible
to wash off.

181
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:15,354
A very impetuous act by the boy.

182
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:17,648
But you're too experienced
to react rashly...

183
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:20,609
which is why the lady for whom you work
lent you that.

184
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:25,281
Oriental pearls, diamonds, a flawless ruby.
Hardly the gems of a governess.

185
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,287
The jewels you are not wearing
tell us more.

186
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:33,789
- Holmes.
- You were engaged.

187
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:36,417
The ring is gone,
but the lighter skin suggests...

188
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:39,295
that you spent some time abroad
wearing it proudly...

189
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:41,964
until you were informed
of its true, modest worth.

190
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:43,799
You broke off the engagement...

191
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:46,802
and returned to England
for better prospects.

192
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:49,597
A doctor, perhaps.

193
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:58,230
Right on all counts, Mr. Holmes,
apart from one.

194
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:03,152
I didn't leave him.

195
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:04,987
He died.

196
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:16,498
Well done, old boy.

197
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:55,120
- Fight. Fight.
- Get him.

198
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:32,241
Get up and fight.

199
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:36,537
Fight.

200
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,205
- Finish it.
- Come on.

201
00:16:44,254 --> 00:16:46,380
Get up and fight, come on.

202
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:48,590
Come on.

203
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:51,176
Get up.

204
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:55,514
Get up and fight.

205
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:04,231
That's it, big man, we're done.

206
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:06,316
You won, congratulations.

207
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:08,402
We ain't done yet.

208
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:16,452
This mustn't register
on an emotional level.

209
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,288
First, distract target.

210
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,249
Then block his blind jab.

211
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:25,294
Counter with cross to left cheek.

212
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,630
Discombobulate.

213
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:30,674
Dazed, he'll attempt wild haymaker.

214
00:17:30,842 --> 00:17:33,969
Employ elbow block, and body shot.

215
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:37,473
Block feral left. Weaken right jaw.

216
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:41,101
Now fracture.

217
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,480
Break cracked ribs.

218
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:46,315
Traumatize solar plexus.

219
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,275
Dislocate jaw entirely.

220
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:53,489
Heel kick to diaphragm.

221
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:59,953
In summary, ears ringing, jaw fractured,
three ribs cracked, four broken...

222
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:02,915
diaphragm hemorrhaging,
physical recovery, six weeks...

223
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,918
full psychological recovery,
six months...

224
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,669
capacity to spit at back of head...

225
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:10,047
neutralized.

226
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:40,077
Where did that come from?

227
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:21,410
What the hell's going on here, Charlie?

228
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:24,121
Lord Blackwood's put him
under some kind of spell, sir.

229
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:27,041
It's like he's burning from the inside out.

230
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:32,421
You lot, shut up!

231
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:34,423
Charlie. Charlie!

232
00:19:34,925 --> 00:19:36,717
Take this man to the infirmary, now.

233
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:51,607
What's this all about, then, Blackwood?

234
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:57,947
There's someone I want to see.

235
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:20,636
- Watson?
- Right.

236
00:20:20,804 --> 00:20:22,471
Let's go.

237
00:20:23,098 --> 00:20:25,057
What started merely as an experiment...

238
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:28,144
has brought me to the threshold
of a monumental discovery.

239
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:31,272
Now, if I play a chromatic scale...

240
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:33,732
there's no measurable response.

241
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,652
You do know what you're drinking
is meant for eye surgery?

242
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,154
But, now...

243
00:20:38,321 --> 00:20:39,655
and this is remarkable...

244
00:20:39,823 --> 00:20:43,450
if I change to atonal clusters...

245
00:20:44,494 --> 00:20:48,956
voilá, they fly in counterclockwise,
synchronized concentric circles...

246
00:20:49,124 --> 00:20:50,708
as though a regimented flock.

247
00:20:50,876 --> 00:20:52,501
Watson, this is exceptional.

248
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:57,464
I, using musical theory,
have created order out of chaos.

249
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:00,259
How did you lure them in?

250
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:02,136
Excellent question.

251
00:21:02,304 --> 00:21:05,181
Individually. I've
been at it for six hours.

252
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:08,017
- And what happens if I do this?
- What?

253
00:21:11,313 --> 00:21:12,688
- Right.
- Clean yourself up.

254
00:21:13,356 --> 00:21:15,316
You are Blackwood's last request.

255
00:21:27,704 --> 00:21:29,788
Look at those towering structures.

256
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:34,251
It's the first combination of bascule
and suspension bridge ever attempted.

257
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:36,337
Most innovative.

258
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:40,716
What an industrious empire.

259
00:21:42,844 --> 00:21:45,387
Oh, I have your winnings from last night.

260
00:21:46,765 --> 00:21:49,600
You weren't there,
so I made your customary bet.

261
00:21:51,394 --> 00:21:55,481
Right. I'll keep it with your checkbook,
locked safely away in my drawer.

262
00:21:57,567 --> 00:22:00,319
Did you know the opera house
is featuring Don Giovanni?

263
00:22:00,487 --> 00:22:05,074
I could procure a couple of tickets if you
had any cultural inclinations this evening.

264
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:10,579
You have the grand gift of silence,
Watson.

265
00:22:10,747 --> 00:22:13,374
It makes you quite invaluable
as a companion.

266
00:22:15,752 --> 00:22:18,128
I knew she'd been engaged.

267
00:22:18,296 --> 00:22:19,421
She had told me.

268
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:21,257
So that's no to the opera, then?

269
00:22:27,973 --> 00:22:31,058
- That was my waistcoat.
- We agreed it's too small for you.

270
00:22:31,226 --> 00:22:32,726
- I'd like it back.
- We agreed.

271
00:22:32,894 --> 00:22:34,395
I want it back.

272
00:23:07,304 --> 00:23:09,305
This way, Mr. Holmes.

273
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,435
Blackwood certainly seems to have got
the crowd into something of a fear frenzy.

274
00:23:14,644 --> 00:23:18,063
Which I'm certain will disperse
once his feet have stopped twitching.

275
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:19,732
Care to come along?

276
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:23,193
No, old cock. I've no business
with him whilst he's alive.

277
00:23:23,361 --> 00:23:25,654
Suit yourself, mother hen.

278
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,753
It seems you have lots of rooms to let.

279
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:44,715
We had to move the prisoners, sir.
Otherwise we were gonna have a riot.

280
00:23:44,883 --> 00:23:48,177
He has a peculiar effect on the inmates.

281
00:23:48,345 --> 00:23:49,928
As though...

282
00:23:51,014 --> 00:23:53,432
he can get inside their heads.

283
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:59,438
I can find my own way
if you have other duties to perform.

284
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:02,358
Much obliged, sir. Thank you, sir.

285
00:24:03,193 --> 00:24:07,029
If any man have an ear, let him hear.

286
00:24:07,197 --> 00:24:10,074
I stood upon the sand of the sea
and saw a beast rise up...

287
00:24:10,241 --> 00:24:11,992
having seven heads and 10 horns.

288
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,453
Upon his heads were
the name of blasphemy.

289
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:16,872
They worshiped the dragon,
which gave power.

290
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,625
They worshiped, saying,
"Who is like unto the beast?"

291
00:24:19,793 --> 00:24:21,668
The beast which I saw
was like a leopard.

292
00:24:21,836 --> 00:24:24,505
His feet were of a bear,
his mouth was of a lion...

293
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:28,300
and the dragon gave him his power
and his seat and great authority.

294
00:24:28,468 --> 00:24:30,761
I love what you've done with the place.

295
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,723
So glad you could accept my invitation.

296
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:37,935
I just have a small point of concern.

297
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:41,522
- How can I help?
- I'd followed the murders with interest.

298
00:24:41,731 --> 00:24:44,525
While my heart went out
to the families of the victims...

299
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:48,654
I couldn't but notice a criminal mastery
in the stroke of your brush.

300
00:24:48,905 --> 00:24:51,240
- You're too kind.
- However, by comparison...

301
00:24:51,408 --> 00:24:55,244
your work in the crypt
was more akin to a finger painting.

302
00:24:58,581 --> 00:25:01,959
So now you're curious
as to whether there's a larger game afoot.

303
00:25:02,127 --> 00:25:04,795
Either that or,

304
00:25:04,963 --> 00:25:08,841
shortly my friend will pronounce you dead
and I thought I might keep him company.

305
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:12,428
Your mistake is to imagine that
anything earthly's led to this moment.

306
00:25:12,595 --> 00:25:16,598
Your error of judgment is to assume
that I'm holding the brush at all.

307
00:25:16,766 --> 00:25:20,310
- I'm merely the channel.
- My only wish is that I caught you sooner.

308
00:25:20,478 --> 00:25:23,272
You see,
five lives might have been spared.

309
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,442
Those lives were a necessity.

310
00:25:28,111 --> 00:25:29,778
Sacrifice.

311
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:33,240
Five meaningless creatures
called to serve a greater purpose.

312
00:25:33,408 --> 00:25:35,826
I wonder if they'd let Watson and me
dissect your brain.

313
00:25:35,994 --> 00:25:37,744
After you're hanged, of course.

314
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:42,749
I'd wager there's some deformity
that'd be scientifically significant.

315
00:25:42,917 --> 00:25:46,545
Then you, too,
could serve a greater purpose.

316
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:50,799
Mr. Holmes, you must widen your gaze.

317
00:25:50,967 --> 00:25:55,804
I'm concerned you underestimate
the gravity of coming events.

318
00:25:56,473 --> 00:25:58,640
You and I are bound together
on a journey...

319
00:25:58,808 --> 00:26:01,393
that will twist the very fabric of nature.

320
00:26:01,936 --> 00:26:06,023
But beneath your mask of logic,
I sense a fragility.

321
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:08,275
That worries me.

322
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:11,778
Steel your mind, Holmes.

323
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:13,447
I need you.

324
00:26:13,615 --> 00:26:16,033
You've come a long way down
from the House of Lords.

325
00:26:16,201 --> 00:26:17,784
- And I will rise again.
- Bon voyage.

326
00:26:17,952 --> 00:26:19,620
Pay attention.

327
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:23,123
Three more will die, and there is
nothing you can do to save them.

328
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:26,335
You must accept
that this is beyond your control...

329
00:26:26,503 --> 00:26:30,047
or, by the time you realize you
made all of this possible...

330
00:26:30,215 --> 00:26:33,467
it'll be the last sane thought
in your head.

331
00:26:41,059 --> 00:26:42,559
What did he want?

332
00:26:42,727 --> 00:26:44,311
Not sure.

333
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:47,439
But I don't think you're needed, Father.
Not for this one.

334
00:26:49,234 --> 00:26:51,193
Lord Henry Blackwood...

335
00:26:51,361 --> 00:26:55,781
you are sentenced to death
for the practice of black magic...

336
00:26:56,199 --> 00:26:59,284
the unholy murder of five
innocent young women...

337
00:26:59,452 --> 00:27:01,870
and the attempted murder of a sixth.

338
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,540
Do you have any final words?

339
00:27:05,542 --> 00:27:07,167
Death...

340
00:27:08,211 --> 00:27:10,379
is only the beginning.

341
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:23,642
...forever and ever. Amen.

342
00:27:44,914 --> 00:27:48,250
That is the end of Lord Blackwood.

343
00:28:09,606 --> 00:28:12,608
London's so bleak this time of year.

344
00:28:13,443 --> 00:28:16,445
Not that I'm pining for New Jersey.

345
00:28:16,613 --> 00:28:19,114
I much prefer to travel in the winter.

346
00:28:21,451 --> 00:28:24,745
Here, I brought you these,
all the way from Syria.

347
00:28:24,912 --> 00:28:27,789
I found these exquisite dates in Jordan...

348
00:28:27,957 --> 00:28:29,958
and your favorite...

349
00:28:30,126 --> 00:28:32,502
olives from the Cyclades.

350
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:34,921
Thought we might have a little tea party.

351
00:28:35,089 --> 00:28:38,550
And while I was setting the table,
I found this:

352
00:28:38,718 --> 00:28:40,802
A file with my name on it.

353
00:28:41,638 --> 00:28:43,972
"Theft of Velázquez portrait
from king of Spain."

354
00:28:44,974 --> 00:28:48,977
"Missing naval documents lead to
resignation of Bulgarian prime minister."

355
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,149
"Scandalous affair ends engagement of...

356
00:28:57,612 --> 00:28:59,738
Hapsburg prince
to Romanov princess."

357
00:29:01,324 --> 00:29:03,825
I was simply studying your methods...

358
00:29:03,993 --> 00:29:06,020
should the authorities
ask me to hunt you down.

359
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,998
But I don't see my name
in any of these articles.

360
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:11,958
But your signature was clear.

361
00:29:13,586 --> 00:29:15,587
Is that the maharajah's
missing diamond?

362
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,965
Or just another souvenir?

363
00:29:19,592 --> 00:29:21,677
Let's not dwell on the past.

364
00:29:23,179 --> 00:29:24,888
Shall we?

365
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,184
By the looks of things,
you're between jobs.

366
00:29:29,352 --> 00:29:32,604
And you between husbands.
How much did you get for the ring?

367
00:29:33,022 --> 00:29:36,692
He was boring and jealous,
and he snored.

368
00:29:39,696 --> 00:29:41,488
I'm Irene Adler again.

369
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:50,330
Thank you.

370
00:29:56,462 --> 00:29:57,879
I need your help.

371
00:29:58,631 --> 00:30:00,840
I need you to find someone.

372
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:04,886
Why are you always so suspicious?

373
00:30:05,054 --> 00:30:07,555
Shall I answer chronologically
or alphabetically?

374
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:11,726
Careful not to cut yourself
on this lethal envelope.

375
00:30:14,647 --> 00:30:17,690
I think you'll find all the information
you need inside.

376
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:20,693
Who are you working for?

377
00:30:22,238 --> 00:30:24,072
So I'll have to find out the hard way?

378
00:30:25,241 --> 00:30:27,575
Keep your money.
I didn't say I'll take the case.

379
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:30,245
Well, consider it a wager that you will.

380
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:33,373
Do you remember The Grand?

381
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,750
They gave me our old room.

382
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:50,515
Hold the door.

383
00:30:50,683 --> 00:30:52,558
Thanks, doctor.

384
00:31:15,124 --> 00:31:16,624
Ma'am.

385
00:31:20,296 --> 00:31:23,506
- He'll do it.
- Well done, Miss Adler.

386
00:31:24,425 --> 00:31:26,426
That's precisely why I hired you.

387
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:30,179
I wager he'll have our man
within the next 24 hours.

388
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:31,931
He'd better.

389
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:34,309
Reordan is the key
to what Blackwood was doing.

390
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:37,145
He's essential to my plan.

391
00:31:37,313 --> 00:31:39,480
Get off out of it.

392
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:42,275
What you doing?
Can't you see where you're going?

393
00:31:42,443 --> 00:31:44,444
- You scalp diver.
- Get off out of it.

394
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:48,156
A little rifle range
would go a long way, sir...

395
00:31:48,324 --> 00:31:51,701
rubbing the calluses
off these German bands.

396
00:31:52,453 --> 00:31:53,786
God save the queen.

397
00:31:54,955 --> 00:31:56,247
God save the queen, sir.

398
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:57,749
Get off out of it.

399
00:32:01,879 --> 00:32:03,212
Look at you.

400
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:06,424
Why is the only woman
you've cared about a criminal?

401
00:32:06,592 --> 00:32:07,633
Are you a masochist?

402
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:09,886
- Allow me to explain.
- Allow me.

403
00:32:10,054 --> 00:32:13,848
She's the only adversary
who ever outsmarted you. Twice.

404
00:32:14,016 --> 00:32:15,683
Made a proper idiot out of you.

405
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:18,478
- Right, you've had your fun.
- What's she after, anyway?

406
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:21,105
- It's time to press on.
- What could she possibly need?

407
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:22,690
It doesn't matter.

408
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:25,985
An alibi? A beard? A human canoe.

409
00:32:26,153 --> 00:32:28,988
She could sit on your back
and paddle you up the Thames.

410
00:32:29,156 --> 00:32:31,240
That's of no consequence to you, is it?

411
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:33,368
We've done our last case together.

412
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:35,119
I've already read it.

413
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:37,997
Missing person:

414
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:41,167
Luke Reordan, 4 foot 10,
red hair, no front teeth.

415
00:32:41,335 --> 00:32:42,377
Case solved.

416
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:45,838
You're obviously not her type.
She likes ginger dwarves.

417
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:47,632
- Midget.
- So you agree?

418
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,050
No, I don't agree.

419
00:32:49,218 --> 00:32:51,803
It's more than technicality, you see.

420
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:55,056
You're misrepresenting the dimensions
of foreshortened peoples.

421
00:32:55,224 --> 00:32:58,726
- I've said too much. I've upset you.
- No, I am simply stating that one has...

422
00:32:58,894 --> 00:33:00,394
What were you doing?

423
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:03,189
- Will you allow me to explain?
- I wish you would.

424
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:29,257
- Holmes. What are you doing?
- Nothing.

425
00:33:29,466 --> 00:33:32,093
- Are you wearing a false...?
- False nose? No.

426
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:34,679
- Tell me that that wasn't...
- That wasn't.

427
00:33:36,223 --> 00:33:38,683
Holmes. Where are you going?

428
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:44,105
Watson.

429
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:47,525
Watson.

430
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:10,381
Got some flowers for you, sweetheart.
Cut you a deal because you're so pretty.

431
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:14,427
My lucky day.

432
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:17,471
Hello, gorgeous.
You got something for me?

433
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:22,935
Don't move.

434
00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:28,024
Now, what have we got here?

435
00:34:29,318 --> 00:34:30,484
It's...

436
00:34:33,906 --> 00:34:35,531
Thank you.

437
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:38,618
That's the Irene I know.

438
00:34:46,168 --> 00:34:47,335
Good boy.

439
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:33,172
This man intrigues me, Watson.
He's got Adler on edge.

440
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,716
- Which is no mean feat.
- She's intimidated.

441
00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:37,051
She's scared of him.

442
00:35:37,219 --> 00:35:38,386
Yet she works for him.

443
00:35:40,097 --> 00:35:41,931
- Right.
- It's nothing to do with me...

444
00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:44,850
but I advise you leave the case alone.

445
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:46,560
Well, I may not have a choice.

446
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:50,856
After all, I may be paying the rent
on my own soon, thanks to you.

447
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,901
- Get that out of my face.
- It's not. It's in my hand.

448
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:55,546
Get what's in your hand
out of my face.

449
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:56,862
- Mr. Holmes?
- Clarkie.

450
00:35:57,739 --> 00:36:00,157
Sir, lnspector Lestrade asks
that you come with me at once.

451
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:02,994
What's he done now,
lost his way to Scotland Yard?

452
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,246
Watson, grab a compass.
"You" means "us."

453
00:36:05,414 --> 00:36:06,914
No, "you" means you.

454
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:09,500
It's Lord Blackwood, sir. He, uh...

455
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:11,002
Well...

456
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:14,463
it appears he's come back
from the grave, sir.

457
00:36:22,222 --> 00:36:25,224
- Most engaging.
- Very clever.

458
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:27,268
I pronounced the man dead myself.

459
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:30,688
What are the facts?

460
00:36:30,856 --> 00:36:34,108
Groundskeeper saw him walking
through the graveyard this morning.

461
00:36:34,735 --> 00:36:36,986
I'll leave this in your capable hands.

462
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:41,741
- I have an appointment with Mary.
- It's not my reputation that's at stake here.

463
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:43,451
Don't try that.

464
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:46,871
- The newspapers got wind of it?
- That's what we're trying to avoid.

465
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:48,622
Certainly.

466
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,249
What's the major concern?

467
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:52,877
Panic. Sheer bloody panic, sir.

468
00:36:53,045 --> 00:36:55,921
- Indeed.
- You're not taking this seriously, are you?

469
00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:57,590
Yes, as you should.

470
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:01,635
It's a matter of professional integrity.

471
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:05,765
No girl wants to marry a doctor
who can't tell if a man's dead or not.

472
00:37:21,823 --> 00:37:24,116
Who do you think won the match,
Clarkie?

473
00:37:24,284 --> 00:37:26,702
- Sir?
- The rugby match.

474
00:37:27,329 --> 00:37:30,998
Your boys have done a magnificent job
obliterating any potential evidence.

475
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:35,169
Yes. But at least they never miss
an opportunity to miss an opportunity.

476
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:40,174
You took your time, Holmes.

477
00:37:40,342 --> 00:37:43,511
"And on the third day"...

478
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,307
These slabs are half a ton each
if they're a pound...

479
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:50,559
and they're smashed open
from the inside.

480
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:53,354
Lestrade, what of the coffin?

481
00:37:53,522 --> 00:37:56,857
- We are in the process of bringing it up.
- I see.

482
00:37:57,859 --> 00:38:02,113
Right. At what stage of the process?
Contemplative?

483
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:06,450
Anyhow, where's our witness?

484
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:07,910
He's over there.

485
00:38:08,078 --> 00:38:10,246
And apparently, he is cata...

486
00:38:10,414 --> 00:38:11,455
Cat...

487
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:13,124
Catatonic, sir.

488
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:16,210
- He's not feeling very well.
- Yes.

489
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:22,216
If you lot don't stop behaving like
quivering milkmaids, you're on double-time.

490
00:38:22,384 --> 00:38:25,886
Now, you get down there
and you bring that coffin up now.

491
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:28,472
Good day, sir.

492
00:38:29,391 --> 00:38:31,058
Hello.

493
00:38:32,269 --> 00:38:33,811
It's all right.

494
00:38:33,979 --> 00:38:35,688
I'm a doctor.

495
00:38:45,866 --> 00:38:48,325
The man's in shock.
He may need a few moments.

496
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:53,164
The witness stated that he saw
Lord Blackwood rise from the grave.

497
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:54,790
Well?

498
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:58,085
- Well?
- You pronounced him dead.

499
00:38:58,253 --> 00:39:00,754
He had no pulse.

500
00:39:05,594 --> 00:39:07,094
Ready.

501
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:09,430
Down.

502
00:39:21,443 --> 00:39:22,943
Good Lord.

503
00:39:24,613 --> 00:39:26,113
That's not Blackwood.

504
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:31,118
Well, now we have a firm grasp
of the obvious.

505
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:37,124
Time of death?

506
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:41,670
Diptera is...

507
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:44,340
approximately...

508
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:48,093
two thirds of an inch
which would put the time of death...

509
00:39:48,261 --> 00:39:50,304
at between 10 and 12 hours ago.

510
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:52,806
May I borrow your pen?

511
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,897
- Adler's dwarf.
- Midget.

512
00:40:09,658 --> 00:40:11,116
I know what I saw.

513
00:40:12,953 --> 00:40:14,328
It was Blackwood.

514
00:40:15,664 --> 00:40:17,957
As clear as I see you.

515
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:22,419
And when the dead walk...

516
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:26,173
the living will fill these coffins.

517
00:40:28,402 --> 00:40:30,570
Well,

518
00:40:34,492 --> 00:40:36,743
Right.
Put the lid on and clean this lot up.

519
00:40:36,911 --> 00:40:38,953
You really believe he was resurrected?

520
00:40:39,121 --> 00:40:41,122
The question is not if, but how.

521
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:43,291
- The game's afoot.
- Follow your spirit...

522
00:40:43,459 --> 00:40:45,209
And upon this charge, cry:

523
00:40:45,336 --> 00:40:48,713
"God for Harry, England and St. George."

524
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,509
There you are.

525
00:40:52,801 --> 00:40:55,261
Why that certain chips stall,
I don't understand.

526
00:40:55,429 --> 00:40:59,641
There's a particular beer in their batter.
A northern stout, to be exact.

527
00:40:59,975 --> 00:41:03,603
You know, Holmes,
I've seen things in war I don't understand.

528
00:41:03,771 --> 00:41:06,064
I once met a man
who predicted his own death...

529
00:41:06,232 --> 00:41:08,566
right down to the number
and the placement...

530
00:41:08,734 --> 00:41:10,985
of the bullets that killed him.

531
00:41:11,153 --> 00:41:12,737
You have to admit, Holmes...

532
00:41:12,905 --> 00:41:15,532
that a supernatural explanation
to this case...

533
00:41:15,699 --> 00:41:17,825
is theoretically possible.

534
00:41:17,993 --> 00:41:22,997
Well, agreed, but it's a huge mistake
to theorize before one has data.

535
00:41:23,165 --> 00:41:25,917
Inevitably one begins to twist facts
to suit theories...

536
00:41:26,085 --> 00:41:28,294
instead of theories to suit facts.

537
00:41:28,462 --> 00:41:32,340
That said, I believe Adler's midget
is the key to this.

538
00:41:34,009 --> 00:41:37,178
Right. Scratches around
the keyhole where the watch was wound.

539
00:41:37,346 --> 00:41:39,973
- What does that tell you?
- The man was likely a drunk.

540
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:43,518
Every time he wound the watch
his hand would slip, hence the scratches.

541
00:41:43,686 --> 00:41:44,727
Very good, Watson.

542
00:41:44,895 --> 00:41:48,606
You've developed considerable
deductive powers of your own.

543
00:41:48,774 --> 00:41:51,526
Let's see now, there are several
sets of initials scored...

544
00:41:51,694 --> 00:41:53,236
- Pawnbrokers' marks.
- Excellent.

545
00:41:53,404 --> 00:41:57,699
Most recent of which are "M.H."
M.H. M.H. is for?

546
00:41:57,866 --> 00:42:00,410
- Maddison and Haig.
- Maddison and Haig.

547
00:42:04,206 --> 00:42:06,541
They should be able to
give us an address.

548
00:42:10,546 --> 00:42:12,255
What a coincidence.

549
00:42:13,215 --> 00:42:15,883
There's one thing you've
failed to deduce from the watch.

550
00:42:16,051 --> 00:42:17,468
Really? I think not.

551
00:42:17,636 --> 00:42:20,847
The time. I have to get back, Holmes.

552
00:42:21,015 --> 00:42:22,890
Taking tea with the in-laws.

553
00:42:23,058 --> 00:42:25,351
- Reckon your future, sir?
- Absolutely not.

554
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:28,062
- No, thank you.
- You need to hear what I have to tell.

555
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:30,565
We have no need of your lucky heather,
gypsy woman.

556
00:42:30,733 --> 00:42:32,984
Even if it's to do with Mary?

557
00:42:39,575 --> 00:42:42,577
I see two men. Brothers.

558
00:42:42,745 --> 00:42:44,579
Not in blood, but in bond.

559
00:42:48,751 --> 00:42:49,959
What of Mary?

560
00:42:50,127 --> 00:42:53,921
M for Mary, for marriage.
Oh, you will be married.

561
00:42:54,923 --> 00:42:56,090
Go on.

562
00:42:56,425 --> 00:42:59,469
I see patterned tablecloths...

563
00:42:59,637 --> 00:43:02,096
and, oh, china figurines...

564
00:43:02,264 --> 00:43:04,223
and, oh, lace doilies.

565
00:43:04,933 --> 00:43:05,933
Doilies.

566
00:43:06,101 --> 00:43:09,604
Lace doilies? Holmes.

567
00:43:10,064 --> 00:43:13,066
Does your depravity know no bounds?

568
00:43:13,233 --> 00:43:15,068
- No.
- Oh, she turns to fat...

569
00:43:15,235 --> 00:43:17,070
and, oh, she has a beard and...

570
00:43:17,237 --> 00:43:19,405
- What of the warts?
- She's covered in warts.

571
00:43:19,573 --> 00:43:21,199
- Enough.
- Are they extensive?

572
00:43:21,367 --> 00:43:23,284
Please, enough.

573
00:43:24,662 --> 00:43:27,622
It's the most apt prediction
Flora has made in years.

574
00:43:28,624 --> 00:43:31,167
And precisely the reason
you can't find a suitable ring.

575
00:43:31,335 --> 00:43:32,418
Do you have my money?

576
00:43:32,586 --> 00:43:35,129
You are terrified of a life
without the thrill of the macabre.

577
00:43:35,297 --> 00:43:37,382
- Do you have my cut from the fight?
- Admit it.

578
00:43:37,549 --> 00:43:39,634
- Give me my money! Holmes.
- Admit it!

579
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:43,346
I see.

580
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:50,853
Thank you.

581
00:43:53,023 --> 00:43:56,651
Well, you've got your ring and
I've got my address for the ginger midget.

582
00:43:56,819 --> 00:44:00,321
- Should be just there.
- I think she'll really like this.

583
00:44:00,489 --> 00:44:04,242
And I have some change in my pocket.

584
00:44:08,122 --> 00:44:11,165
- Shall I look after it for you?
- No, no.

585
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,918
- Don't give it away here.
- No.

586
00:44:14,086 --> 00:44:16,087
I have to go see Mary.

587
00:44:16,338 --> 00:44:18,172
Give her my best.

588
00:44:19,049 --> 00:44:21,092
And her family, as well.

589
00:45:01,049 --> 00:45:03,217
It does make a considerable
difference to me...

590
00:45:03,385 --> 00:45:05,970
having someone with me
on whom I can thoroughly rely.

591
00:45:06,138 --> 00:45:09,640
Well, you can rely on me
for exactly 10 minutes.

592
00:45:11,727 --> 00:45:14,228
He clearly felt something
was coming to get him.

593
00:45:14,396 --> 00:45:16,272
Something did.

594
00:45:17,232 --> 00:45:19,025
Irene Adler was here.

595
00:45:19,234 --> 00:45:23,279
Either that or the ginger midget
wore the same Parisian perfume.

596
00:45:26,116 --> 00:45:28,576
Putrefaction.

597
00:45:33,207 --> 00:45:36,918
Ammonium sulfate, among other aromas.

598
00:45:41,006 --> 00:45:42,757
Phosphorous.

599
00:45:43,759 --> 00:45:45,426
Formaldehyde.

600
00:45:57,105 --> 00:45:59,273
It looks like...

601
00:46:00,108 --> 00:46:02,360
he was attempting to combine...

602
00:46:02,528 --> 00:46:05,905
some kind of sorcery
and scientific formula.

603
00:46:13,872 --> 00:46:15,790
More importantly...

604
00:46:16,375 --> 00:46:18,918
let's see what he was
trying to dispose of.

605
00:46:20,128 --> 00:46:22,713
- Potassium, magnesium.
- Sultaphytic acid.

606
00:46:22,881 --> 00:46:26,843
It'll suck the iron right out of the ink
as long as it's not too burnt.

607
00:46:41,650 --> 00:46:43,150
Peculiar.

608
00:46:45,571 --> 00:46:47,905
Hydrated rhododendron.

609
00:47:12,973 --> 00:47:15,182
Holmes.

610
00:47:15,350 --> 00:47:16,851
Look at the crest.

611
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:19,770
Reordan was working with Blackwood.

612
00:47:19,938 --> 00:47:21,689
Of course he was.

613
00:47:21,857 --> 00:47:24,150
The question is, to what end.

614
00:47:27,613 --> 00:47:31,365
Whatever he was working on,
he clearly succeeded.

615
00:47:31,533 --> 00:47:32,867
How so?

616
00:47:33,035 --> 00:47:35,244
Otherwise, he'd still be alive.

617
00:47:35,412 --> 00:47:38,039
Which is why Miss Adler
is so desperate to find him.

618
00:47:38,707 --> 00:47:39,707
Yes.

619
00:47:39,875 --> 00:47:41,876
There is one odor
I can't quite put my finger on.

620
00:47:42,044 --> 00:47:45,379
Is it candy floss? Molasses?

621
00:47:45,547 --> 00:47:46,923
Maple syrup?

622
00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:48,215
Barley sugar.

623
00:47:48,383 --> 00:47:50,134
Toffee apple.

624
00:47:55,557 --> 00:47:57,224
Let me guess.

625
00:47:57,392 --> 00:47:59,518
Judging by your arsonist tool kit...

626
00:47:59,686 --> 00:48:03,648
you're here to burn down the building
and extinguish all evidence therein.

627
00:48:03,815 --> 00:48:06,067
Just one minute, boys.

628
00:48:06,234 --> 00:48:08,027
Oh, Dredger.

629
00:48:27,714 --> 00:48:29,048
Meat...

630
00:48:29,383 --> 00:48:30,591
or potatoes?

631
00:48:31,301 --> 00:48:32,969
My 10 minutes are up.

632
00:49:26,314 --> 00:49:27,815
You all right?

633
00:50:43,683 --> 00:50:45,226
Holmes...

634
00:50:45,852 --> 00:50:47,186
what is that?

635
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:16,586
Holmes!

636
00:55:10,224 --> 00:55:11,724
Watson...

637
00:55:12,226 --> 00:55:14,352
what have you done?

638
00:55:25,531 --> 00:55:27,323
I haven't slept all night.

639
00:55:27,575 --> 00:55:29,492
Not a wink.

640
00:55:30,911 --> 00:55:33,329
Why I ever believed...

641
00:55:33,581 --> 00:55:37,250
that I would get to have tea
with Mary's parents is beyond me...

642
00:55:37,418 --> 00:55:41,629
- having been talked into going with you.
- We were set upon. It was self-defense.

643
00:55:41,797 --> 00:55:46,050
I've been reviewing my notes
on our exploits over the last seven months.

644
00:55:46,218 --> 00:55:48,011
Would you like to know my conclusion?

645
00:55:48,596 --> 00:55:51,514
- I am psychologically disturbed.
- How so?

646
00:55:51,682 --> 00:55:55,852
Why else would I continually be
led into situations...

647
00:55:56,020 --> 00:56:00,607
where you deliberately withhold
your plans from me? Why else?

648
00:56:01,442 --> 00:56:04,777
You've never complained
about my methods before.

649
00:56:04,945 --> 00:56:07,238
- I'm not complaining.
- What do you call this?

650
00:56:07,406 --> 00:56:09,282
How am I complaining? I never complain.

651
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:12,368
Do I complain about you practicing
the violin in the morning...

652
00:56:12,536 --> 00:56:16,748
or your mess, your lack of hygiene,
or the fact that you steal my clothes?

653
00:56:16,916 --> 00:56:18,124
We have a barter system.

654
00:56:18,292 --> 00:56:20,627
Do I complain
about you setting fire to my rooms?

655
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:21,836
- Our rooms.
- The rooms.

656
00:56:22,004 --> 00:56:24,631
When do I complain
that you experiment on my dog?

657
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:25,965
- Our dog.
- On the dog.

658
00:56:26,133 --> 00:56:27,592
Gladstone is our dog.

659
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:32,805
Where I do take issue is your campaign
to sabotage my relationship with Mary.

660
00:56:40,481 --> 00:56:41,856
I understand.

661
00:56:42,024 --> 00:56:43,733
- Do you?
- I do.

662
00:56:44,944 --> 00:56:47,362
- I don't think you do.
- You're overtired.

663
00:56:47,988 --> 00:56:49,489
- Yes.
- You're feeling sensitive.

664
00:56:49,657 --> 00:56:50,823
I'm not sensitive.

665
00:56:50,991 --> 00:56:53,201
What you need is a rest.

666
00:56:53,369 --> 00:56:56,037
My brother, Mycroft,
has a small estate near Chichester.

667
00:56:56,205 --> 00:57:00,625
Beautiful grounds. There's a folly.
We can throw a lamb on the spit.

668
00:57:00,793 --> 00:57:04,587
We? Holmes, if I were to go to the country,
it would be with my future wife.

669
00:57:04,755 --> 00:57:07,840
- Well, certainly, if we must...
- No, not you. Mary and I.

670
00:57:08,008 --> 00:57:09,801
- You are not...
- What, invited?

671
00:57:09,969 --> 00:57:12,595
Why would I not be invited
to my brother's country home?

672
00:57:12,763 --> 00:57:14,305
Now you're not making any sense.

673
00:57:14,473 --> 00:57:15,515
You're not human.

674
00:57:15,683 --> 00:57:17,016
John Watson?

675
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:19,560
Yes.

676
00:57:19,728 --> 00:57:21,521
Your bail's been posted.

677
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:28,945
Mary.

678
00:57:32,616 --> 00:57:34,284
Just Watson.

679
00:57:41,834 --> 00:57:45,545
I hope you get bail by breakfast,
because the boys are getting hungry.

680
00:57:50,384 --> 00:57:52,051
Step lively.

681
00:57:55,848 --> 00:57:57,932
Back off. Back off.

682
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:00,560
To which the barman says,
"May I push in your stool?"

683
00:58:04,398 --> 00:58:05,690
Right, you, you're out.

684
00:58:06,859 --> 00:58:08,401
Until next time, Big Joe.

685
00:58:08,569 --> 00:58:10,945
Always a pleasure, Mr. Holmes.

686
00:58:12,031 --> 00:58:14,657
Thank heaven you're here.
I'd almost run out of jokes.

687
00:58:14,825 --> 00:58:17,019
In another life,
you'd have made an excellent criminal.

688
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:20,496
And you, sir, an excellent policeman.
Tomski, thank you.

689
00:58:21,623 --> 00:58:23,458
Now, please tell me you have answers.

690
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:25,918
All in good time, Lestrade.

691
00:58:26,086 --> 00:58:29,589
"All in good time"? Is this some parlor
game where we guess what you're thinking?

692
00:58:29,757 --> 00:58:32,967
I've got a public in frenzy out there.
If you don't fill me in...

693
00:58:33,135 --> 00:58:36,971
I'll have you in there playing Victoria
and Albert quicker than a bookie's runner.

694
00:58:37,306 --> 00:58:40,266
Now, clean up
and make yourself presentable.

695
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:41,768
For whom?

696
00:58:41,935 --> 00:58:45,646
Friends in high places.
They're the ones who bailed you out.

697
00:58:56,408 --> 00:58:59,702
I'm terribly sorry
to inconvenience you, sir...

698
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:02,288
but I'm gonna have to put this on you.

699
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:10,463
Mr. Holmes,
apologies for summoning you like this.

700
00:59:10,798 --> 00:59:14,425
I'm sure it's quite a mystery
as to where you are and who I am.

701
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:15,968
As to where I am...

702
00:59:16,387 --> 00:59:20,306
I was, admittedly, lost for a moment
between Charing Cross and Holborn.

703
00:59:20,474 --> 00:59:23,601
But I was saved by the bread shop
on Saffron Hill...

704
00:59:23,769 --> 00:59:27,313
the only baker to use a certain
French glaze on their loaves...

705
00:59:27,481 --> 00:59:28,731
a Brittany sage.

706
00:59:28,899 --> 00:59:33,653
The carriage forked left, then right,
a telltale bump over the Fleet Conduit.

707
00:59:33,821 --> 00:59:37,824
And as to who you are, that took every
ounce of my not inconsiderable experience.

708
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:41,327
The letters on your desk are addressed
to Sir Thomas Rotheram.

709
00:59:41,495 --> 00:59:43,913
Lord Chief Justice,
that'd be your official title.

710
00:59:44,081 --> 00:59:47,667
Who you really are is, of course,
another matter entirely.

711
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:50,169
Judging by the sacred ox on your ring...

712
00:59:50,337 --> 00:59:52,880
you're the head of
the Temple of the Four Orders...

713
00:59:53,048 --> 00:59:54,841
in whose headquarters we now sit...

714
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:58,177
on the northwest corner
of St. James's Square, I think.

715
00:59:58,345 --> 01:00:02,765
As to the mystery, the only mystery is
why you bothered to blindfold me at all.

716
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:09,188
Yes, well, standard procedure,
I suppose.

717
01:00:11,024 --> 01:00:13,359
I daresay we have the right man,
gentlemen.

718
01:00:13,527 --> 01:00:16,279
Sherlock Holmes,
Ambassador Standish from America...

719
01:00:16,447 --> 01:00:18,364
and Lord Coward, the home secretary.

720
01:00:19,074 --> 01:00:22,869
I suppose you already have some notion
as to the practices of our order.

721
01:00:23,537 --> 01:00:25,538
Yes.

722
01:00:25,706 --> 01:00:28,374
They're practically interesting.

723
01:00:28,542 --> 01:00:29,959
Be as skeptical as you like.

724
01:00:30,127 --> 01:00:33,588
But our secret systems have steered
the world towards good for centuries.

725
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:37,175
The danger is they can also be used
for more nefarious purposes.

726
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:40,136
What some call the dark arts,
or practical magic.

727
01:00:40,304 --> 01:00:43,890
We know
you don't believe in magic, Mr. Holmes.

728
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:46,642
We don't expect you to share our faith...

729
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:48,227
merely our fears.

730
01:00:48,395 --> 01:00:50,980
Fear is the more infectious condition.

731
01:00:51,148 --> 01:00:53,149
In this instance...

732
01:00:55,527 --> 01:00:57,236
fear of your own child.

733
01:01:00,532 --> 01:01:02,200
Blackwood is your son.

734
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:05,828
You have the same irises,
a rare dark green...

735
01:01:05,996 --> 01:01:07,914
with diamond-shaped hazel flecks...

736
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:12,084
together with identical outer ears, which
are only passed down through bloodline...

737
01:01:12,252 --> 01:01:14,295
which makes you either brothers...

738
01:01:14,463 --> 01:01:17,215
or, in this case, more likely,
father and son.

739
01:01:22,513 --> 01:01:25,681
Very few people
are privy to that information...

740
01:01:25,849 --> 01:01:27,683
and we want to keep it that way.

741
01:01:32,481 --> 01:01:34,607
He was conceived
during one of our rituals.

742
01:01:34,775 --> 01:01:36,192
His mother wasn't my wife...

743
01:01:36,777 --> 01:01:38,611
but she shared our beliefs.

744
01:01:38,779 --> 01:01:40,947
She was a powerful practitioner...

745
01:01:41,114 --> 01:01:43,783
though not enough
to survive giving birth to him.

746
01:01:45,786 --> 01:01:47,787
Death followed him wherever he went.

747
01:01:47,955 --> 01:01:50,373
Those five girls were not the first
to be butchered.

748
01:01:50,541 --> 01:01:53,709
He killed many more,
using them to enhance his powers.

749
01:01:54,294 --> 01:01:57,463
No one could prove anything,
of course, but we all knew.

750
01:01:58,632 --> 01:02:00,174
The boy was a curse.

751
01:02:00,342 --> 01:02:03,302
We've done our best to stop him,
but it's not enough.

752
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:04,887
His power grows daily.

753
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:07,139
His resurrection is evidence of that.

754
01:02:07,641 --> 01:02:09,809
But what he does next
will be more dangerous.

755
01:02:09,977 --> 01:02:14,480
His secret lies in the book
of spells. This is the source of his power.

756
01:02:15,065 --> 01:02:17,942
He's gonna raise a force
that will alter the course of the world.

757
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:20,903
We want you to find him
and stop him before he does.

758
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:24,699
We'll give you any assistance
that we can.

759
01:02:25,826 --> 01:02:29,328
As home secretary, I have considerable
influence over the police.

760
01:02:29,496 --> 01:02:31,038
Yes.

761
01:02:32,791 --> 01:02:34,125
So...

762
01:02:37,546 --> 01:02:39,755
The benefit of being
a consulting detective...

763
01:02:39,923 --> 01:02:42,008
is that I can pick and choose
my clients.

764
01:02:42,843 --> 01:02:44,677
So consider it done, I'll stop him.

765
01:02:46,305 --> 01:02:48,139
But not for you.

766
01:02:48,307 --> 01:02:50,266
And certainly not for a price.

767
01:02:53,604 --> 01:02:57,106
- I do have a parting query, Sir Thomas.
- What is that?

768
01:02:57,274 --> 01:03:01,110
If the rest of his family's dead,
how long do you expect to survive?

769
01:03:02,529 --> 01:03:03,613
Food for thought.

770
01:03:28,555 --> 01:03:32,058
Well, perhaps you'll have better luck
opening that.

771
01:03:32,601 --> 01:03:35,895
Margaux '58. A comet vintage.

772
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:40,399
How fascinating that an astronomical event
can affect the quality...

773
01:03:40,567 --> 01:03:43,069
How is it going with our case
you refuse to take?

774
01:03:43,236 --> 01:03:44,570
...of the wine.

775
01:03:45,697 --> 01:03:48,658
Oh, I've hit a dead end, literally.

776
01:03:50,202 --> 01:03:51,744
I found your man.

777
01:03:51,912 --> 01:03:54,246
He's buried in Blackwood's tomb.

778
01:03:55,123 --> 01:03:56,499
If you still need him.

779
01:03:58,418 --> 01:04:00,252
Oh, dear.

780
01:04:02,214 --> 01:04:05,424
Hope my client
doesn't come looking for a refund.

781
01:04:05,592 --> 01:04:06,926
He's a professor, isn't he?

782
01:04:07,094 --> 01:04:10,012
Couldn't see his face,
but I spotted chalk on his lapel.

783
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:14,433
I've never known a professor to carry
a gun, and on such a clever contraption.

784
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:20,940
Eye patch, nice touch.

785
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:23,943
So case closed...

786
01:04:24,111 --> 01:04:27,113
which makes this a social visit.

787
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:30,199
No, it's a "you're in over your head,
Irene" visit.

788
01:04:30,909 --> 01:04:33,411
Whoever killed Reordan
was covering their tracks...

789
01:04:33,578 --> 01:04:35,788
which makes you the next loose end
to be snipped.

790
01:04:37,833 --> 01:04:39,500
Let it breathe.

791
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:42,586
I've never been in over my head.

792
01:04:42,754 --> 01:04:46,298
Leave now. Disappear.
You're good at that.

793
01:04:46,466 --> 01:04:50,553
Or stay and volunteer
for protective custody.

794
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:57,143
If I'm in danger, so are you.

795
01:05:00,814 --> 01:05:02,481
Come with me.

796
01:05:05,110 --> 01:05:06,819
What if we trusted each other?

797
01:05:08,697 --> 01:05:09,780
You're not listening.

798
01:05:09,948 --> 01:05:14,535
I'm taking you to either the
railway station or the police station.

799
01:05:26,381 --> 01:05:27,840
So...

800
01:05:31,178 --> 01:05:33,012
- Which is it to be?
- Careful.

801
01:05:34,890 --> 01:05:36,515
You decide.

802
01:05:36,683 --> 01:05:39,101
- Which will it be?
- What...?

803
01:05:39,686 --> 01:05:41,562
I told you to let it breathe.

804
01:05:42,355 --> 01:05:44,523
Can you taste the comet?

805
01:05:50,572 --> 01:05:53,949
Why couldn't you just
come away with me?

806
01:05:55,285 --> 01:05:57,036
Never.

807
01:07:43,768 --> 01:07:47,980
Madam, I need you to remain calm
and trust me, I'm a professional.

808
01:07:48,148 --> 01:07:50,649
But beneath this pillow
lies the key to my release.

809
01:07:51,985 --> 01:07:55,154
- She misinterpreted my intention entirely.
- Naturally, sir.

810
01:07:55,322 --> 01:07:58,115
That's why I find this modern
religious fervor so troubling.

811
01:07:58,283 --> 01:08:01,535
- No latitude for misunderstanding.
- Faith runs right over reason, sir.

812
01:08:01,703 --> 01:08:04,705
Indeed. And chambermaids
were once such a liberal breed.

813
01:08:04,873 --> 01:08:07,166
My wife's a chambermaid, sir.

814
01:08:09,294 --> 01:08:13,213
Anyhow, a good thing she was offended,
or we may never have found you.

815
01:08:13,381 --> 01:08:17,134
The inspector's been over to Baker Street
himself this morning, sir.

816
01:08:20,931 --> 01:08:23,015
Just joking about the wife, sir.

817
01:08:27,562 --> 01:08:29,063
We've checked everything, sir.

818
01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:32,066
No sign of a break-in
and the butler didn't hear a thing.

819
01:08:32,233 --> 01:08:34,401
So body in the bathtub...

820
01:08:34,569 --> 01:08:38,822
his eyes were wide open,
and the only thing missing was...

821
01:08:39,824 --> 01:08:41,867
his ring, sir.

822
01:08:58,009 --> 01:08:59,718
Why did you drain the water?

823
01:08:59,886 --> 01:09:03,555
- Out of common decency.
- Crime is common, logic is rare.

824
01:09:03,723 --> 01:09:07,726
The decent thing to do is to catch the
killer, not provide comfort for the corpse.

825
01:09:22,409 --> 01:09:23,909
What is that?

826
01:09:27,497 --> 01:09:29,415
- Jasmine bath salts, sir.
- Superb.

827
01:09:29,582 --> 01:09:33,210
Probably comes from a larger container.
It'll either be in the pantry...

828
01:09:33,378 --> 01:09:37,089
high up where it's warm and dry,
or in a linen cupboard with a vent.

829
01:09:38,091 --> 01:09:39,591
Constable, you could do worse...

830
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:43,053
than to check the ground under
the rear windows for any footprints.

831
01:09:43,221 --> 01:09:45,931
Data, data, data.
I cannot make bricks without clay.

832
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:46,909
Mr. Holmes?

833
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:57,711
Was it in the cupboard or the pantry?

834
01:10:57,879 --> 01:10:59,671
It was in the pantry, sir.

835
01:11:00,131 --> 01:11:01,924
I don't know what to make of this.

836
01:11:02,092 --> 01:11:03,842
Excellent work.

837
01:11:04,010 --> 01:11:05,761
Adieu.

838
01:11:43,716 --> 01:11:47,219
What's the meaning of this, Coward?
Why have you called this meeting?

839
01:11:48,429 --> 01:11:49,680
Sir Thomas is dead.

840
01:11:51,891 --> 01:11:54,893
I nominate Lord Blackwood
as head of the order.

841
01:11:57,939 --> 01:11:59,940
Have you lost your mind?

842
01:12:00,108 --> 01:12:02,067
You know damn well
what he's capable of.

843
01:12:02,235 --> 01:12:04,111
Of course he does.

844
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:07,865
That's why we're here.

845
01:12:09,409 --> 01:12:11,076
That's why we're all here.

846
01:12:17,083 --> 01:12:20,752
My powers and my assets
were given to me for one purpose.

847
01:12:21,129 --> 01:12:25,299
A magnificent but simple purpose.

848
01:12:26,426 --> 01:12:28,510
To create a new future.

849
01:12:29,137 --> 01:12:32,598
A future ruled...

850
01:12:32,765 --> 01:12:34,516
by us.

851
01:12:36,477 --> 01:12:41,607
Tomorrow at noon, we take the first step
towards a new chapter in our history.

852
01:12:43,109 --> 01:12:44,484
Magic will lead the way.

853
01:12:44,652 --> 01:12:47,112
Once the people of England
see our newfound power...

854
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:49,198
they'll bow down in fear.

855
01:12:54,162 --> 01:12:57,956
Across the Atlantic
lies a colony that was once ours.

856
01:12:58,124 --> 01:12:59,458
It will be again.

857
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:02,628
The Civil War has made them weak.

858
01:13:02,795 --> 01:13:07,633
Their government is as corrupt
and as ineffective as ours...

859
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:10,010
so we'll take it back.

860
01:13:11,638 --> 01:13:14,014
We will remake the world...

861
01:13:15,725 --> 01:13:17,434
create the future.

862
01:13:18,728 --> 01:13:22,481
These men are with me, Standish...

863
01:13:22,649 --> 01:13:24,191
but...

864
01:13:24,484 --> 01:13:25,859
are you?

865
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:29,238
No, sir. I am not.

866
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:33,116
These powers that you're playing with...

867
01:13:33,284 --> 01:13:35,327
no man can control.

868
01:13:37,455 --> 01:13:39,248
Well, gentlemen...

869
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:44,169
someone has to stop him,
even if you won't.

870
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:48,507
Oh, I wouldn't do that if I were you.

871
01:13:53,721 --> 01:13:55,722
Save me!

872
01:14:11,823 --> 01:14:13,490
Gentlemen...

873
01:14:13,658 --> 01:14:15,534
don't be afraid.

874
01:14:16,494 --> 01:14:18,328
As you can see...

875
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:21,623
we are protected.

876
01:14:22,875 --> 01:14:25,377
Come, drink your allegiance here.

877
01:14:31,634 --> 01:14:35,387
You control the police, now use them.

878
01:14:47,150 --> 01:14:48,400
Didn't know you were here.

879
01:14:48,568 --> 01:14:51,820
Since this room is no longer yours,
do you mind if I utilize it?

880
01:14:53,197 --> 01:14:54,698
Be my guest.

881
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:58,144
- In here, chaps.
- Where would you like me...

882
01:14:58,244 --> 01:15:00,662
- to put him, sir?
- Anywhere is fine.

883
01:15:11,257 --> 01:15:14,384
- Who is he?
- The man who tried to kill you at Reordan's.

884
01:15:14,552 --> 01:15:17,429
His neck didn't survive the impact
of Dredger landing on him.

885
01:15:18,097 --> 01:15:19,598
Yes.

886
01:15:20,266 --> 01:15:22,142
Thanks for that, by the way.

887
01:15:24,103 --> 01:15:28,648
There is consolation in the knowledge that
he could be of service to his fellow man.

888
01:15:32,612 --> 01:15:37,282
Elbows and arms stained with blood,
but it's older than his own injuries.

889
01:15:43,247 --> 01:15:45,290
None of it human.

890
01:15:46,167 --> 01:15:47,709
He's not a butcher, let me see.

891
01:15:57,845 --> 01:16:00,097
Yellow flame, green bursts.

892
01:16:00,681 --> 01:16:01,973
An industrial worker.

893
01:16:06,212 --> 01:16:07,546
Coal.

894
01:16:07,814 --> 01:16:09,439
River silt.

895
01:16:09,607 --> 01:16:11,983
The slag on his trousers
should put him squarely in...

896
01:16:12,151 --> 01:16:14,319
- Nine Elms.
- Sorry, what?

897
01:16:14,904 --> 01:16:17,155
The area you're looking for is Nine Elms.

898
01:16:17,323 --> 01:16:19,157
I wondered.

899
01:16:19,325 --> 01:16:22,661
Do you remember where I put
the Lords Register of members' interests?

900
01:16:22,829 --> 01:16:24,204
It's on the stepladder.

901
01:16:34,674 --> 01:16:39,177
Well, Blackwood's had his hand in just about
everything that's corrosive to the spirit.

902
01:16:39,804 --> 01:16:42,764
Woolwich Arsenal.
Limehouse Chemical Works.

903
01:16:42,932 --> 01:16:44,933
It'll probably be a factory by the river.

904
01:16:45,351 --> 01:16:46,852
What's that?

905
01:16:47,270 --> 01:16:48,770
Never mind.

906
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:52,858
You don't know where
my rugby ball went, do you?

907
01:16:53,025 --> 01:16:54,359
No, not a clue.

908
01:16:54,527 --> 01:16:57,487
Queenshithe Slaughterhouse.

909
01:16:57,655 --> 01:16:59,030
Nine Elms.

910
01:16:59,198 --> 01:17:01,199
A factory by the river.

911
01:17:01,576 --> 01:17:04,536
Well done. That should lead us
to Blackwood, dead or alive.

912
01:17:05,121 --> 01:17:06,788
Not us.

913
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:09,958
You.

914
01:17:10,418 --> 01:17:11,877
Yes.

915
01:17:13,254 --> 01:17:15,505
Just a figure of speech, old boy.

916
01:17:24,599 --> 01:17:25,891
He's left it there on purpose.

917
01:17:46,412 --> 01:17:48,872
More coal, doctor.

918
01:17:53,336 --> 01:17:56,046
That's a good one. He's such a tit.

919
01:17:56,214 --> 01:17:57,756
Oh, God. Yeah.

920
01:17:57,924 --> 01:17:59,758
Glad to see you two
are working hard.

921
01:17:59,926 --> 01:18:02,594
And I thought we were
trying to be discreet.

922
01:18:02,762 --> 01:18:06,598
You would not last one day in the navy.

923
01:18:08,935 --> 01:18:12,854
Are you sure there isn't an alternative
means of water transportation than that?

924
01:18:13,022 --> 01:18:16,608
I guarantee you nobody knows
London's waterways better.

925
01:18:16,859 --> 01:18:20,278
- Tanner's practically a fish himself.
- He certainly drinks like one.

926
01:18:20,446 --> 01:18:22,614
Oh, you found a sense of humor, doctor.

927
01:18:22,782 --> 01:18:25,033
If only just a sense.

928
01:18:25,451 --> 01:18:29,371
I better take over, there.
Bit tricky down here.

929
01:18:50,518 --> 01:18:52,435
Come on, come on.

930
01:19:07,743 --> 01:19:09,286
- Look familiar?
- Yep.

931
01:19:09,453 --> 01:19:12,122
All that's missing is a ginger midget.

932
01:19:24,552 --> 01:19:27,053
They cleared something away from here
not minutes ago.

933
01:19:27,221 --> 01:19:28,805
Like what?

934
01:19:29,098 --> 01:19:32,183
Not sure. Something mechanical.

935
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:33,977
Holmes.

936
01:19:34,604 --> 01:19:36,354
Look at this.

937
01:20:00,463 --> 01:20:02,130
- 1:18.
- Chapter and verse.

938
01:20:02,298 --> 01:20:06,051
Revelations 1:18.
"I am he that liveth, and was dead."

939
01:20:06,469 --> 01:20:09,471
"And behold, I'm alive for evermore."

940
01:20:10,598 --> 01:20:14,476
I warned you, Holmes, to accept
that this was beyond your control...

941
01:20:14,644 --> 01:20:17,520
beyond what your rational mind
could comprehend.

942
01:20:19,106 --> 01:20:23,068
- What a busy afterlife you're having.
- I want you to bear witness.

943
01:20:23,694 --> 01:20:28,156
Tomorrow, at midday,
the world as you know it will end.

944
01:20:28,324 --> 01:20:30,742
Show me your face,
it'll be the end of your world.

945
01:20:30,910 --> 01:20:32,869
Save your bullets, Watson.

946
01:20:33,287 --> 01:20:34,537
A gift for you.

947
01:20:39,919 --> 01:20:42,003
What was that about saving bullets?

948
01:20:48,344 --> 01:20:50,720
She followed you here, Holmes.

949
01:20:52,723 --> 01:20:55,600
You led your lamb to slaughter.

950
01:20:58,562 --> 01:20:59,938
Holmes.

951
01:21:01,524 --> 01:21:03,274
This game was designed to hurt.

952
01:21:15,037 --> 01:21:16,371
Watson!

953
01:21:20,626 --> 01:21:21,793
It's warm in here, Watson.

954
01:21:29,135 --> 01:21:30,635
In over your head yet, darling?

955
01:21:38,561 --> 01:21:40,270
- Hold on there.
- I can't.

956
01:21:40,438 --> 01:21:42,105
Let me take your weight.

957
01:21:43,232 --> 01:21:45,024
Give us a leg up, old boy.

958
01:21:47,528 --> 01:21:49,320
These German locks
always give me trouble.

959
01:21:55,077 --> 01:21:56,578
It's a band saw.

960
01:21:59,999 --> 01:22:02,000
No matter, we have plenty of time.

961
01:22:03,711 --> 01:22:05,044
Holmes.

962
01:22:13,179 --> 01:22:15,180
- It's not working.
- Keep calm.

963
01:22:23,314 --> 01:22:25,148
Holmes, hurry up.

964
01:22:32,698 --> 01:22:35,533
Don't get excited. Turn off that valve.

965
01:23:00,643 --> 01:23:02,644
And we'll bounce in three, two...

966
01:23:04,063 --> 01:23:05,230
one.

967
01:23:15,825 --> 01:23:17,810
Thank you.

968
01:23:17,910 --> 01:23:19,577
I'm gonna get after Blackwood.

969
01:23:29,463 --> 01:23:30,880
Thank you.

970
01:23:31,298 --> 01:23:33,925
We should help the doctor.

971
01:23:45,354 --> 01:23:47,021
Holmes!

972
01:25:18,781 --> 01:25:20,573
Mr. Holmes.

973
01:25:22,618 --> 01:25:24,035
Sir.

974
01:25:27,581 --> 01:25:29,499
Mr. Holmes.

975
01:25:38,217 --> 01:25:42,053
Mr. Holmes, we have an order
for your arrest, sir.

976
01:25:46,058 --> 01:25:47,141
Sir!

977
01:25:47,309 --> 01:25:50,978
Lord Coward has issued a warrant
for your arrest, sir.

978
01:25:52,272 --> 01:25:53,773
Now, Watson's alive.

979
01:25:53,941 --> 01:25:56,859
Just get out of here, sir. Go, sir, go.

980
01:26:13,085 --> 01:26:15,002
Will the train be departing on time?

981
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:17,463
The train's been delayed, madam.

982
01:26:17,631 --> 01:26:19,674
Shouldn't be long now, though.

983
01:26:35,983 --> 01:26:39,610
The train will depart when I tell it to.

984
01:26:41,238 --> 01:26:44,532
And you will leave my employment
when I allow you to.

985
01:26:48,871 --> 01:26:51,205
I fulfilled my contract.

986
01:26:51,373 --> 01:26:52,623
I found Reordan.

987
01:26:52,791 --> 01:26:54,959
He's in Scotland Yard's mortuary.

988
01:26:55,127 --> 01:26:56,961
So that's me, finished.

989
01:26:57,129 --> 01:27:01,007
Your job was to manipulate Holmes'
feelings for you...

990
01:27:01,175 --> 01:27:02,759
not succumb to them.

991
01:27:05,637 --> 01:27:07,472
You have fulfilled nothing.

992
01:27:07,639 --> 01:27:10,308
I want what Reordan was making
for Blackwood.

993
01:27:10,934 --> 01:27:14,479
Finish the job or the next dead body...

994
01:27:14,646 --> 01:27:17,273
will be Sherlock Holmes.

995
01:27:43,884 --> 01:27:45,843
The surgeon should be along shortly.

996
01:27:50,682 --> 01:27:53,017
He should be able to rest now.

997
01:27:56,146 --> 01:27:57,647
Excuse me.

998
01:28:01,652 --> 01:28:03,361
Is that the best you can do?

999
01:28:03,529 --> 01:28:05,363
Yes, for now.

1000
01:28:05,531 --> 01:28:07,657
I must attend to my other patients.

1001
01:28:09,701 --> 01:28:11,077
Doctor.

1002
01:28:11,537 --> 01:28:13,204
Doctor.

1003
01:28:13,664 --> 01:28:15,289
Please.

1004
01:28:18,961 --> 01:28:22,213
I know that you care for him
as much as I do.

1005
01:28:22,381 --> 01:28:25,800
This is not your responsibility,
it was his choice.

1006
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:29,720
He'd say that it was worth the wounds.

1007
01:28:36,353 --> 01:28:38,229
Solve this.

1008
01:28:39,064 --> 01:28:41,065
Whatever it takes.

1009
01:28:51,368 --> 01:28:53,244
This is beyond your control.

1010
01:28:53,412 --> 01:28:55,037
Sheer bloody panic, sir. Panic.

1011
01:28:55,205 --> 01:28:57,999
- It's Lord Blackwood, sir.
- I've never been in over my head.

1012
01:28:58,166 --> 01:29:02,044
It's nothing to do with me,
but I advise you leave the case alone.

1013
01:29:02,212 --> 01:29:03,921
- Solve this.
- Are you, Holmes?

1014
01:29:04,047 --> 01:29:06,116
Accept that this was beyond your control.

1015
01:29:06,216 --> 01:29:09,552
- Tomorrow, at midday, the world will end.
- I've got a public in frenzy.

1016
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:11,053
Holmes!

1017
01:29:32,117 --> 01:29:33,743
Widen your gaze.

1018
01:29:33,911 --> 01:29:36,454
You must widen your gaze.
Widen your gaze.

1019
01:29:36,622 --> 01:29:41,042
You and I are bound together on a journey
that will twist the very fabric of nature.

1020
01:29:41,209 --> 01:29:43,294
Steel your mind, Holmes.
Widen your gaze.

1021
01:29:43,462 --> 01:29:45,948
He's gonna raise a force
that will alter the world.

1022
01:29:46,048 --> 01:29:48,992
- His power grows daily.
- This is the source of his power.

1023
01:29:49,092 --> 01:29:50,092
I need you.

1024
01:29:50,260 --> 01:29:52,803
His secret lies in the book of spells.

1025
01:30:20,082 --> 01:30:22,875
Three more will die...

1026
01:30:23,502 --> 01:30:26,295
and there is nothing you can do
to save them.

1027
01:30:26,964 --> 01:30:29,340
We know you don't believe in magic.

1028
01:30:30,509 --> 01:30:32,259
Reordan was working with Blackwood.

1029
01:30:32,386 --> 01:30:33,427
Is that better?

1030
01:30:33,595 --> 01:30:36,055
He clearly felt something
was coming to get him.

1031
01:30:37,307 --> 01:30:41,185
His eyes were wide open
and the only thing missing was his ring.

1032
01:30:48,276 --> 01:30:50,194
Give up, Holmes.

1033
01:30:52,489 --> 01:30:54,865
This is a riddle you cannot solve.

1034
01:31:01,164 --> 01:31:02,373
Good morning.

1035
01:31:05,961 --> 01:31:09,046
Now, you need to work.

1036
01:31:09,923 --> 01:31:11,173
Familiar artwork.

1037
01:31:14,302 --> 01:31:15,553
You look gorgeous.

1038
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:21,017
Somehow I knew you wouldn't leave.

1039
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:30,401
You made the front page.

1040
01:31:30,819 --> 01:31:32,528
Only a name and no picture.

1041
01:31:33,905 --> 01:31:37,867
So it looks like you'll be needing to
work outside the law now...

1042
01:31:38,035 --> 01:31:40,077
and that's my area of expertise.

1043
01:31:40,245 --> 01:31:42,204
I feel safer already.

1044
01:31:44,583 --> 01:31:46,792
You seem to be making a rapid recovery.

1045
01:31:48,086 --> 01:31:49,712
Yes.

1046
01:31:49,921 --> 01:31:52,423
Took the shrapnel out myself.

1047
01:31:52,591 --> 01:31:55,426
Mary said I had a lousy doctor.

1048
01:32:00,682 --> 01:32:02,183
Well, I'm...

1049
01:32:02,601 --> 01:32:04,143
I'm just so...

1050
01:32:04,311 --> 01:32:05,895
very glad that you're...

1051
01:32:06,063 --> 01:32:07,438
well...

1052
01:32:07,898 --> 01:32:09,356
with us.

1053
01:32:13,528 --> 01:32:17,865
Now that you're sitting comfortably,
I shall begin.

1054
01:32:18,366 --> 01:32:21,410
My initial approach was far too narrow.

1055
01:32:21,578 --> 01:32:24,038
When Blackwood invited me
to Pentonville Prison...

1056
01:32:24,206 --> 01:32:27,625
he suggested I widen my gaze
and, at minimum, I have done just that.

1057
01:32:27,793 --> 01:32:32,797
In fact, I may well have reconciled
thousands of years of theological disparity.

1058
01:32:34,132 --> 01:32:36,467
But that's for another time.

1059
01:32:36,635 --> 01:32:39,804
Blackwood's method is based on
a ritualistic mystical system...

1060
01:32:39,971 --> 01:32:43,265
that's been employed by the
Temple of the Four Orders for centuries.

1061
01:32:43,433 --> 01:32:46,519
To fully understand the system,
to get inside it...

1062
01:32:46,686 --> 01:32:50,231
I reenacted the ceremony
we interrupted at the crypt...

1063
01:32:50,398 --> 01:32:52,316
with a few enhancements of my own.

1064
01:32:53,276 --> 01:32:57,321
My journey took me somewhat further down
the rabbit hole than I had intended...

1065
01:32:57,489 --> 01:33:01,992
and though I dirtied my fluffy white tail,
I have emerged enlightened.

1066
01:33:03,286 --> 01:33:05,830
The fraternity who silently control
the empire...

1067
01:33:05,997 --> 01:33:09,166
share the belief with the kings,
pharaohs and emperors of old...

1068
01:33:09,334 --> 01:33:12,128
that the sphinx was a door
to another dimension...

1069
01:33:12,295 --> 01:33:14,380
a gateway to immeasurable power.

1070
01:33:14,548 --> 01:33:18,300
It's made up of four parts:
The foot of a lion, the tail of an ox...

1071
01:33:18,468 --> 01:33:20,845
the wings of an eagle,
and the head of a man.

1072
01:33:21,638 --> 01:33:24,557
In Sir Thomas's secret chamber,
I found the bone of an ox...

1073
01:33:24,724 --> 01:33:27,810
the tooth of a lion, the feather
of an eagle and hair of a man.

1074
01:33:27,978 --> 01:33:29,353
Map.

1075
01:33:33,191 --> 01:33:36,026
The points of the star
represent the five murdered girls...

1076
01:33:36,194 --> 01:33:39,155
but the cross
is what we're now interested in.

1077
01:33:39,406 --> 01:33:40,698
It's a widely held belief...

1078
01:33:40,866 --> 01:33:44,243
that within the architecture
of the great cities...

1079
01:33:44,411 --> 01:33:47,163
are coded references to this system.

1080
01:33:47,330 --> 01:33:50,332
Since he rose from the grave,
Blackwood has killed three men...

1081
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:54,003
each committed at a location
that has a connection with the temple...

1082
01:33:54,171 --> 01:33:55,546
therefore the system.

1083
01:33:57,340 --> 01:33:59,550
Reordan, the ginger midget,
represents man.

1084
01:33:59,718 --> 01:34:01,719
We found his body here.

1085
01:34:02,345 --> 01:34:05,556
Sir Thomas, master of the temple,
wore the ox ring.

1086
01:34:06,516 --> 01:34:08,058
He died here.

1087
01:34:08,894 --> 01:34:10,519
Standish, ambassador to America...

1088
01:34:10,687 --> 01:34:13,814
where the eagle has been
the national emblem for over 100 years.

1089
01:34:13,982 --> 01:34:18,068
The headquarters of the Temple
of the Four Orders where he died...

1090
01:34:18,236 --> 01:34:20,487
is here.

1091
01:34:21,156 --> 01:34:24,491
Correspondingly, the map will tell us
the location of Blackwood's final act.

1092
01:34:24,659 --> 01:34:27,494
So we have man, the ox, eagle.

1093
01:34:28,413 --> 01:34:29,580
Only the lion remaining.

1094
01:34:29,748 --> 01:34:30,915
Right here.

1095
01:34:33,585 --> 01:34:34,752
Parliament.

1096
01:34:39,591 --> 01:34:41,050
Right.

1097
01:34:41,218 --> 01:34:44,762
You four stay here
and the rest of you come with me.

1098
01:34:44,930 --> 01:34:47,806
- Get out of the way, you lowlifes!
- Right this way.

1099
01:34:51,269 --> 01:34:53,103
Ladies first.

1100
01:34:53,271 --> 01:34:54,772
Now.

1101
01:34:55,732 --> 01:34:57,092
Follow these instructions.

1102
01:34:57,192 --> 01:34:58,734
- Aren't you...?
- Go.

1103
01:35:02,364 --> 01:35:04,531
Hello, hello, hello.

1104
01:35:05,158 --> 01:35:07,284
Did the devil turn up?

1105
01:35:08,536 --> 01:35:09,912
Well...

1106
01:35:10,288 --> 01:35:11,956
never mind.

1107
01:35:12,457 --> 01:35:14,124
You got the next best thing.

1108
01:35:37,482 --> 01:35:41,819
Beg your pardon, my Lord.
I know that it's unorthodox...

1109
01:35:42,988 --> 01:35:44,488
but Mr. Holmes here...

1110
01:35:44,656 --> 01:35:48,325
he's been making some
serious accusations about you...

1111
01:35:49,536 --> 01:35:51,078
and the order.

1112
01:35:53,123 --> 01:35:54,164
I see.

1113
01:35:54,332 --> 01:35:58,502
Well, at least that solves the great
mystery as to how you became inspector.

1114
01:36:03,842 --> 01:36:05,801
Excuse me, my Lord...

1115
01:36:06,344 --> 01:36:08,846
but I've been wanting to do that
for a long time.

1116
01:36:09,014 --> 01:36:12,683
Well, inspector, I have five minutes
before my next engagement...

1117
01:36:13,310 --> 01:36:16,687
so why don't you regale me
with your stories of conspiracy?

1118
01:36:19,774 --> 01:36:21,275
Thank you, Lestrade.

1119
01:36:21,776 --> 01:36:23,360
My Lord.

1120
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:32,328
I'm curious, Coward. Did you assist
Blackwood in all the murders...

1121
01:36:32,537 --> 01:36:34,496
or just the one I prevented?

1122
01:36:35,665 --> 01:36:38,125
Very distinctive,
those handmade shoes of yours.

1123
01:36:40,545 --> 01:36:45,424
But the price of quality
is often the unique imprint they leave.

1124
01:36:46,384 --> 01:36:49,553
Nonetheless, I confess to being
completely outmatched.

1125
01:36:50,305 --> 01:36:53,015
I could deduce very little
from my investigation.

1126
01:36:54,392 --> 01:36:56,560
Fortunately,
there's nothing more stimulating...

1127
01:36:56,728 --> 01:36:59,063
than a case where everything
goes against you.

1128
01:36:59,731 --> 01:37:03,233
How many members of Parliament
do you intend to murder at noon today?

1129
01:37:03,401 --> 01:37:05,027
Man, ox, eagle, lion.

1130
01:37:05,904 --> 01:37:07,488
The lion is Parliament, isn't it?

1131
01:37:10,575 --> 01:37:12,284
Very clever.

1132
01:37:12,702 --> 01:37:15,245
But it's not murder, Mr. Holmes.

1133
01:37:15,413 --> 01:37:17,081
It's mercy.

1134
01:37:17,248 --> 01:37:19,750
We are giving the weak masses
a strong shepherd.

1135
01:37:19,918 --> 01:37:22,378
Don't you see that it's for their own...?

1136
01:37:25,173 --> 01:37:27,883
No, but I don't care much what you think.

1137
01:37:28,051 --> 01:37:30,928
I simply wanted to know the location
of Blackwood's ceremony...

1138
01:37:31,096 --> 01:37:32,513
and you've given it to me.

1139
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:33,889
I've told you nothing.

1140
01:37:34,474 --> 01:37:37,768
But your clothes say
infinitely more than you could ever hope.

1141
01:37:37,936 --> 01:37:40,103
The mud on your boots
from where you've been walking.

1142
01:37:41,272 --> 01:37:44,608
A touch of red brick dust on your knee
from where you've been kneeling.

1143
01:37:45,902 --> 01:37:49,113
A small bandage on your thumb
from where you've been vowing.

1144
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:53,283
A faint aroma of excrement
from where you've been standing.

1145
01:37:55,537 --> 01:37:58,288
You and Blackwood laid the final touches
to your ceremony...

1146
01:37:58,456 --> 01:38:01,542
in the sewers beneath Parliament
less than an hour ago.

1147
01:38:02,627 --> 01:38:04,628
Both houses meet today.

1148
01:38:05,213 --> 01:38:07,214
The whole government will be present.

1149
01:38:16,599 --> 01:38:19,893
It's a shame you made an enemy
out of Blackwood, Holmes.

1150
01:38:20,603 --> 01:38:22,396
You would have made a valuable ally.

1151
01:38:29,821 --> 01:38:31,738
How terrible is wisdom...

1152
01:38:31,906 --> 01:38:34,783
when it brings no profit to the wise.

1153
01:38:35,493 --> 01:38:36,994
We take power at noon.

1154
01:38:37,996 --> 01:38:40,330
There isn't any time to waste then,
is there?

1155
01:39:07,192 --> 01:39:09,443
I told you he'd be coming
out the top window.

1156
01:39:09,611 --> 01:39:12,112
There isn't any way
he'd be coming over that terrace.

1157
01:39:12,280 --> 01:39:15,115
Technically, that isn't the top window,
is it, sailor boy?

1158
01:39:15,283 --> 01:39:17,784
- What is it?
- Well, it's the middle window.

1159
01:39:17,952 --> 01:39:19,119
Anyway.

1160
01:39:20,205 --> 01:39:22,789
You'll be pleased to know
Lestrade performed perfectly.

1161
01:39:22,957 --> 01:39:24,625
In fact, I think he enjoyed it.

1162
01:39:24,792 --> 01:39:26,502
I hope you know what you're doing.

1163
01:39:27,212 --> 01:39:28,879
Here's the key.

1164
01:39:29,047 --> 01:39:32,883
- You got all you needed from Coward?
- Yes, I smoked him out with relative ease.

1165
01:39:34,260 --> 01:39:35,302
- Tanner?
- Sir?

1166
01:39:35,470 --> 01:39:36,720
If you would, captain...

1167
01:39:36,888 --> 01:39:39,723
take us under the bridge,
port side, 100 yards.

1168
01:39:39,891 --> 01:39:43,227
Beyond that you'll find the tunnel
that leads us to the sewers.

1169
01:39:43,394 --> 01:39:44,811
Right away, sir.

1170
01:39:51,569 --> 01:39:53,445
The end is nigh.

1171
01:39:53,613 --> 01:39:57,908
Blackwood's come back from hell
and laid a curse upon this land.

1172
01:39:58,076 --> 01:40:01,703
He walks in every shadow
and every puff of smoke.

1173
01:40:01,871 --> 01:40:04,540
Behold, he cometh with clouds...

1174
01:40:04,707 --> 01:40:07,543
and every eye shall see him...

1175
01:40:07,710 --> 01:40:11,296
and every soul shall wail
because of him.

1176
01:40:11,464 --> 01:40:14,466
You cannot stop him!
No one can!

1177
01:40:44,497 --> 01:40:46,957
Behold, Blackwood's magic revealed.

1178
01:40:47,125 --> 01:40:49,917
- What does it do?
- It's a chemical weapon.

1179
01:40:50,253 --> 01:40:51,378
The first of its kind.

1180
01:40:51,546 --> 01:40:53,505
You deduced that how?

1181
01:40:53,673 --> 01:40:55,424
From my pocket.

1182
01:40:55,592 --> 01:40:58,594
I snipped this off a rather recumbent rat
at the slaughterhouse.

1183
01:40:58,761 --> 01:41:01,888
Note the blue discoloration,
the faint smell of bitter almonds.

1184
01:41:02,056 --> 01:41:04,141
- Telltale traces of cyanide.
- Cyanide.

1185
01:41:08,938 --> 01:41:11,313
Now we know
what the ginger midget was working on.

1186
01:41:11,441 --> 01:41:13,317
It'll revolutionize warfare.

1187
01:41:13,484 --> 01:41:15,027
Yes, killing a lot of people.

1188
01:41:15,194 --> 01:41:17,821
Now, it's seven minutes to noon.
What are we gonna do?

1189
01:41:19,324 --> 01:41:21,074
Right. How many men
did you count on the...?

1190
01:41:24,579 --> 01:41:26,622
She loves an entrance, your muse.

1191
01:41:57,403 --> 01:41:58,695
Woman!

1192
01:41:59,822 --> 01:42:01,698
Shoot him. Now, please.

1193
01:42:14,087 --> 01:42:18,840
My lords.

1194
01:42:19,801 --> 01:42:21,051
The time has come...

1195
01:42:21,219 --> 01:42:23,553
for only those who believe to remain.

1196
01:42:25,390 --> 01:42:26,682
Behold...

1197
01:42:26,849 --> 01:42:28,725
Lord Blackwood.

1198
01:42:41,698 --> 01:42:43,365
You seem surprised.

1199
01:42:46,077 --> 01:42:49,496
I have returned from beyond the grave
to fulfill England's destiny...

1200
01:42:50,665 --> 01:42:54,418
and extend the boundaries
of this great empire.

1201
01:42:57,088 --> 01:42:59,047
Listen to the rabble outside.

1202
01:42:59,716 --> 01:43:01,216
Listen...

1203
01:43:01,384 --> 01:43:02,759
to the fear.

1204
01:43:03,386 --> 01:43:05,053
I will use that as a weapon...

1205
01:43:05,221 --> 01:43:07,139
to control them...

1206
01:43:07,640 --> 01:43:08,890
and then the world.

1207
01:43:13,271 --> 01:43:15,564
I've never seen anything like it.
Look at this.

1208
01:43:19,193 --> 01:43:22,195
Specifically designed
to prevent us from disarming it.

1209
01:43:24,866 --> 01:43:27,743
These appear to be designed
to receive a signal of some sort.

1210
01:43:27,910 --> 01:43:29,119
Electromagnetic waves?

1211
01:43:29,287 --> 01:43:30,954
When triggered, the electrodes...

1212
01:43:31,122 --> 01:43:33,707
will send a charge
converting the chemical into gas.

1213
01:43:33,875 --> 01:43:37,753
The gas will travel up that shaft and
filter through the ventilation system...

1214
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:40,547
that leads directly to Parliament.
Within seconds...

1215
01:43:40,715 --> 01:43:43,800
the most powerful men in the world
will be choking on death.

1216
01:43:43,968 --> 01:43:47,304
Blackwood must have some transmitter
that he can activate remotely.

1217
01:43:47,472 --> 01:43:49,306
Three minutes, 10 seconds.

1218
01:43:49,724 --> 01:43:53,810
I will create an empire
that will endure for millennia...

1219
01:43:54,437 --> 01:43:56,062
indestructible...

1220
01:43:56,230 --> 01:43:57,481
and eternal.

1221
01:43:58,065 --> 01:43:59,900
Move it. Move it.

1222
01:44:00,318 --> 01:44:02,819
We don't actually have to
disarm the device...

1223
01:44:02,987 --> 01:44:06,531
we just have to remove the cylinders.

1224
01:44:06,699 --> 01:44:09,659
Yes, except that they're welded in.

1225
01:44:09,827 --> 01:44:12,954
What we need is a controlled explosion.

1226
01:44:13,122 --> 01:44:16,708
We'll need a container to direct the blast.
My clay pipe should service that ambition.

1227
01:44:37,480 --> 01:44:40,106
I rather wish you hadn't done that,
Irene.

1228
01:44:46,405 --> 01:44:51,409
On the 12th chime,
I will summon the dark powers.

1229
01:44:51,994 --> 01:44:56,331
All those of you who are with me
shall be protected.

1230
01:44:56,499 --> 01:44:57,541
All others...

1231
01:44:57,708 --> 01:44:59,042
will perish.

1232
01:45:06,300 --> 01:45:07,968
I need your pipe.

1233
01:45:11,639 --> 01:45:13,056
Nut him!

1234
01:45:38,332 --> 01:45:39,749
- Right.
- What?

1235
01:45:39,917 --> 01:45:41,585
- Coat.
- Got it.

1236
01:46:19,790 --> 01:46:21,082
The new order...

1237
01:46:22,543 --> 01:46:23,627
begins now.

1238
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:30,800
Woman.

1239
01:46:31,636 --> 01:46:33,261
What are you waiting for?

1240
01:46:36,140 --> 01:46:37,349
That.

1241
01:46:48,653 --> 01:46:50,320
Apprehend Lord Coward.

1242
01:46:52,907 --> 01:46:54,783
- Can you manage?
- Course I can.

1243
01:47:21,811 --> 01:47:23,228
Relax...

1244
01:47:23,396 --> 01:47:24,437
I'm a doctor.

1245
01:48:36,594 --> 01:48:39,012
Did you take a wrong turning
somewhere?

1246
01:48:41,056 --> 01:48:42,265
We're safe now.

1247
01:48:43,309 --> 01:48:44,601
Interesting assessment.

1248
01:48:47,146 --> 01:48:48,813
Run off.

1249
01:48:51,066 --> 01:48:52,859
I won't be chasing you anymore.

1250
01:48:54,445 --> 01:48:56,279
Fare thee well.

1251
01:49:01,452 --> 01:49:03,453
I don't want to run anymore.

1252
01:49:06,332 --> 01:49:08,792
- I'll tell you everything.
- I wish you would.

1253
01:49:32,983 --> 01:49:34,150
No!

1254
01:50:40,009 --> 01:50:41,467
There was never any magic.

1255
01:50:43,721 --> 01:50:45,221
Only conjuring tricks.

1256
01:50:49,852 --> 01:50:51,853
The simplest involved
paying people off...

1257
01:50:52,021 --> 01:50:55,273
like the guard who pretended
to be possessed outside your cell.

1258
01:50:55,441 --> 01:50:57,984
Your reputation
and the inmates' fear did the rest.

1259
01:50:59,570 --> 01:51:02,071
Others required
more elaborate preparations...

1260
01:51:02,239 --> 01:51:05,533
like the sandstone slab
that covered your tomb.

1261
01:51:06,493 --> 01:51:10,455
You had it broken before your burial,
then put back together using an adhesive.

1262
01:51:11,790 --> 01:51:14,250
An ancient Egyptian recipe, I believe...

1263
01:51:14,418 --> 01:51:16,502
a mixture of egg and honey...

1264
01:51:17,171 --> 01:51:19,422
designed to be washed away
by the rain.

1265
01:51:24,428 --> 01:51:25,762
Holmes!

1266
01:51:25,930 --> 01:51:28,681
Arranging for your father
to drown in his own bathtub...

1267
01:51:28,849 --> 01:51:30,683
required more modern science.

1268
01:51:30,851 --> 01:51:33,770
Very clever of Reordan
to find a paralytic...

1269
01:51:33,938 --> 01:51:36,940
that was activated by the combination
of copper and water...

1270
01:51:37,107 --> 01:51:40,443
and was therefore undetectable
once the bath water was drained.

1271
01:51:41,278 --> 01:51:43,279
That might've been a challenge for me...

1272
01:51:43,447 --> 01:51:47,033
had he not also tested it
on some unfortunate amphibians.

1273
01:51:51,705 --> 01:51:54,791
The death of Standish
was a real mystery...

1274
01:51:54,959 --> 01:51:58,044
until you used the same compound
to blow up the wharf.

1275
01:51:59,380 --> 01:52:01,798
An odorless, tasteless flammable liquid...

1276
01:52:02,424 --> 01:52:04,550
yet it burned
with an unusual pinkish hue.

1277
01:52:06,637 --> 01:52:09,973
Did Standish mistake it for rain
as he entered the temple?

1278
01:52:11,141 --> 01:52:12,600
All it took was a spark.

1279
01:52:17,064 --> 01:52:19,273
A simple rigged bullet in his gun.

1280
01:52:20,734 --> 01:52:22,151
Ingenious.

1281
01:52:22,319 --> 01:52:25,780
Like all great performers, you saved
your pièce de résistance for the end:

1282
01:52:25,948 --> 01:52:30,743
A chemical weapon distilled from cyanide
and refined in the bellies of swine.

1283
01:52:30,911 --> 01:52:32,453
Had it worked...

1284
01:52:32,621 --> 01:52:35,498
your followers in Parliament
would have watched unharmed...

1285
01:52:35,666 --> 01:52:38,167
as their colleagues
were dying around them.

1286
01:52:38,335 --> 01:52:40,336
They didn't know
you'd given them the antidote.

1287
01:52:40,504 --> 01:52:42,922
Instead,
they would've believed it was magic...

1288
01:52:43,090 --> 01:52:45,800
and that you'd harnessed
the ultimate power.

1289
01:52:46,135 --> 01:52:49,846
And the world would've followed,
fear being the most powerful weapon of all.

1290
01:52:51,807 --> 01:52:54,684
You'd better hope
that it's nothing more than superstition...

1291
01:52:54,852 --> 01:52:57,020
as you performed
all the rituals perfectly.

1292
01:52:57,855 --> 01:52:59,814
The devil is due a soul, I'd say.

1293
01:53:02,109 --> 01:53:04,193
For God's sake, Holmes, cut me loose.

1294
01:53:14,997 --> 01:53:18,624
First, the world will see you
for what you are. A fraud.

1295
01:53:20,210 --> 01:53:21,544
Then you'll be hanged.

1296
01:53:21,712 --> 01:53:23,546
Properly, this time.

1297
01:53:23,714 --> 01:53:25,840
It's a long journey from here to the rope.

1298
01:54:17,184 --> 01:54:20,103
I've never woken up in handcuffs before.

1299
01:54:21,105 --> 01:54:22,647
I have.

1300
01:54:23,941 --> 01:54:25,525
Naked.

1301
01:54:29,488 --> 01:54:31,614
Storm's coming.

1302
01:54:31,907 --> 01:54:35,451
Well, we've still got a moment.

1303
01:54:39,456 --> 01:54:40,706
Moriarty.

1304
01:54:40,874 --> 01:54:42,291
What?

1305
01:54:42,459 --> 01:54:44,460
That's his name.

1306
01:54:45,045 --> 01:54:47,213
And he is a professor.

1307
01:54:49,341 --> 01:54:51,425
Everyone has a weak spot...

1308
01:54:51,844 --> 01:54:54,095
and he found mine.

1309
01:54:55,514 --> 01:54:57,473
Where was it, precisely?

1310
01:55:08,360 --> 01:55:11,487
Please don't underestimate him.

1311
01:55:11,655 --> 01:55:14,031
He's just as brilliant as you are...

1312
01:55:14,199 --> 01:55:16,450
and infinitely more devious.

1313
01:55:16,618 --> 01:55:18,828
We'll see about that.

1314
01:55:35,304 --> 01:55:37,680
You'll miss me, Sherlock.

1315
01:55:39,683 --> 01:55:41,350
Sadly...

1316
01:55:41,977 --> 01:55:43,644
yes.

1317
01:56:09,004 --> 01:56:10,838
Just keep it under your hat.

1318
01:56:11,006 --> 01:56:13,925
Afternoon, sir.
I put the notebooks in this one, sir.

1319
01:56:14,092 --> 01:56:16,052
- Thank you.
- What's in these, John?

1320
01:56:16,220 --> 01:56:17,220
Scribbles.

1321
01:56:17,387 --> 01:56:18,888
- Scribbles?
- Notes.

1322
01:56:19,056 --> 01:56:21,724
They're your adventures.
I'd like to read them.

1323
01:56:28,565 --> 01:56:29,899
Come on, what's wrong?

1324
01:56:30,067 --> 01:56:32,610
Do you think he's come to terms
with you leaving?

1325
01:56:32,778 --> 01:56:36,155
Mary, look at the ring he's given us.

1326
01:56:36,782 --> 01:56:39,075
Now, five minutes here
and we'll go home.

1327
01:56:39,243 --> 01:56:40,618
Our home.

1328
01:56:40,786 --> 01:56:42,453
Get up those stairs.

1329
01:56:50,379 --> 01:56:51,921
Don't worry, dear.

1330
01:56:52,089 --> 01:56:54,173
Suicide is not in his repertoire.

1331
01:56:54,341 --> 01:56:56,634
He's far too fond of himself for that.

1332
01:56:57,261 --> 01:56:58,928
Holmes.

1333
01:57:00,955 --> 01:57:02,582
Good afternoon.

1334
01:57:02,849 --> 01:57:06,936
I was trying to deduce the manner
in which Blackwood survived his execution.

1335
01:57:07,104 --> 01:57:09,188
Clearing your good name, as it were.

1336
01:57:09,523 --> 01:57:12,066
But it had a surprisingly
soporific effect...

1337
01:57:12,234 --> 01:57:15,945
and I was carried off in the arms
of Morpheus like a caterpillar in a cocoon.

1338
01:57:16,113 --> 01:57:17,446
Good afternoon, dear.

1339
01:57:17,614 --> 01:57:19,282
Get on with it, Holmes.

1340
01:57:19,449 --> 01:57:23,119
Cleverly concealed in the hangman's knot
was a hook.

1341
01:57:23,287 --> 01:57:26,289
Oh, dear, my legs have fallen asleep.
I should come down.

1342
01:57:26,456 --> 01:57:28,040
John, shouldn't we help him down?

1343
01:57:28,208 --> 01:57:30,626
No, no, no,
I hate to cut him off midstream.

1344
01:57:30,794 --> 01:57:31,961
Carry on.

1345
01:57:33,005 --> 01:57:35,673
Well, the executioner
attached it to a harness...

1346
01:57:35,841 --> 01:57:38,634
allowing the weight to be
distributed around the waist...

1347
01:57:38,802 --> 01:57:40,845
and the neck to remain intact.

1348
01:57:41,013 --> 01:57:44,473
My Lord, I can't feel my cheeks.
Might we continue this at ground level?

1349
01:57:44,641 --> 01:57:46,267
How did you manage it, Holmes?

1350
01:57:46,893 --> 01:57:50,104
I managed it with braces,
belts and a coat hook.

1351
01:57:51,064 --> 01:57:53,941
Please, my tongue is going,
I'll be of no use to you at all.

1352
01:57:54,109 --> 01:57:55,818
- Worse things could happen.
- John.

1353
01:57:58,655 --> 01:58:01,782
Yet none of this explains
Blackwood's lack of pulse.

1354
01:58:01,950 --> 01:58:03,326
Right.

1355
01:58:03,493 --> 01:58:08,789
Now, the medical mystery.
We must restore your reputation, Watson.

1356
01:58:08,957 --> 01:58:12,585
There is a toxin refined from the nectar
of the rhododendron ponticum.

1357
01:58:12,753 --> 01:58:15,838
It's infamous in the region of Turkey
bordering the Black Sea...

1358
01:58:16,006 --> 01:58:19,508
for its ability to induce
an apparently mortal paralysis.

1359
01:58:19,676 --> 01:58:23,095
Enough to mislead a medical mind
even as well-trained as your own.

1360
01:58:23,263 --> 01:58:25,598
- It's known as...
- What's wrong with Gladstone?

1361
01:58:25,766 --> 01:58:27,641
...mad honey disease.

1362
01:58:27,809 --> 01:58:31,604
Oh, he's demonstrating
the very effect I've just described.

1363
01:58:31,980 --> 01:58:33,314
He doesn't mind.

1364
01:58:35,859 --> 01:58:38,277
Mary, don't worry, he's seen far worse.

1365
01:58:38,904 --> 01:58:40,279
Mr. Holmes?

1366
01:58:42,574 --> 01:58:43,824
Doctor. Miss Mary.

1367
01:58:44,534 --> 01:58:47,661
Sir, lnspector Lestrade asks that
you come with me right away.

1368
01:58:48,205 --> 01:58:51,540
- What is it is this time, Clarkie?
- It's one of our sergeants, sir.

1369
01:58:51,708 --> 01:58:54,293
He went missing
the day you stopped Lord Blackwood.

1370
01:58:54,461 --> 01:58:58,047
I'm afraid sewage workers
found his body just this morning, sir.

1371
01:58:58,507 --> 01:59:01,550
We believe the sergeant
was our first man on the scene.

1372
01:59:01,718 --> 01:59:03,511
Can I help you, officer?

1373
01:59:04,262 --> 01:59:05,304
Shot in the head.

1374
01:59:06,973 --> 01:59:08,724
Was it a small caliber bullet?

1375
01:59:09,851 --> 01:59:11,185
Yes.

1376
01:59:12,687 --> 01:59:14,939
Were there powder burns
on his eyebrows?

1377
01:59:15,107 --> 01:59:16,774
Indeed, sir.

1378
01:59:18,902 --> 01:59:20,236
Point blank range?

1379
01:59:20,404 --> 01:59:21,654
Moriarty.

1380
01:59:23,073 --> 01:59:25,241
Professor Moriarty.

1381
01:59:27,786 --> 01:59:29,745
Oh, there's a good boy.

1382
01:59:29,913 --> 01:59:31,497
Everything's gonna be fine.

1383
01:59:32,707 --> 01:59:34,375
Where is Blackwood's device now?

1384
01:59:34,543 --> 01:59:37,586
Secret Service have it, sir.
They've taken over the case.

1385
01:59:38,088 --> 01:59:40,297
I'd wager there's a piece missing.

1386
01:59:42,259 --> 01:59:45,302
So Moriarty was after
a piece of the machine...

1387
01:59:45,929 --> 01:59:47,179
not the poison.

1388
01:59:47,347 --> 01:59:49,765
There's nothing more elusive
than an obvious fact.

1389
01:59:49,933 --> 01:59:52,393
The wire-free invention
was the game all along.

1390
01:59:52,561 --> 01:59:55,020
And Adler was just the diversion.

1391
01:59:55,188 --> 01:59:57,815
He knew I'd chase her,
leaving the machine accessible.

1392
01:59:57,983 --> 02:00:01,861
A technology of that kind
would be worth an untold fortune.

1393
02:00:02,028 --> 02:00:04,321
Imagine being able
to control any device...

1394
02:00:04,489 --> 02:00:08,159
simply by sending a command
via radio waves.

1395
02:00:08,952 --> 02:00:10,953
It's the future, Watson.

1396
02:00:13,248 --> 02:00:15,708
I've loaded the last of your boxes, sir.

1397
02:00:19,045 --> 02:00:20,629
- Well...
- Well...

1398
02:00:21,965 --> 02:00:24,842
- Gladstone.
- Stop him before he gets to the front door.

1399
02:00:25,427 --> 02:00:26,844
Clarkie.

1400
02:00:29,097 --> 02:00:30,931
Case reopened.
