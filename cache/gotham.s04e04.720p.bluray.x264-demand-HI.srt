HARPER: According to the fire alarm,
just past midnight.

169

Whoever did it
must have snuck past security.

170
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,448
His grandson. Alex.
He's my age, a little bit younger.

- Have you talked to him?
- No one's seen any kid.

would actually kill for it?

Detective Gordon, I'll tell you
what you want to know.

But all I ask is
that you let me come along.

If this is because of the knife,
then I'm responsible.

Gotta say, they don't do much
for the vibe of the place.

If you had acquired the knife
when I first requested it,

they wouldn't be necessary.

about this knife anyway?

By all means.

My father's illegal businesses
hold no interest for me.

230

I'm here because the Falcone family
has a number of charities

that attention

it's unfounded.

You know, your father
taught me many things.

Among them was to nurture
a healthy paranoia.

Now, perhaps
they've vanished for good.

He had on his school uniform.

he's made a choice
not to trust the cops.

340

00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:20,494
and entreat you
to return the knife to me.

493
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,666
You say this knife
is important to your country.

494
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:24,452
Please explain.

495
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:25,536
(LIGHT CHUCKLE)

496
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:29,174
There is an ancient story
amongst my people

497
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:33,553
of a man who could not die.

498
00:24:35,516 --> 00:24:37,758
In his time,
he committed terrible acts.

499
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:40,351
Raised a great kingdom.

500
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:42,595
And then vanished.

501
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,305
What happened to him?

502
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:46,350
If the legend is to be believed,

503
00:24:46,777 --> 00:24:49,611
he walked away from his throne,
vowing that one day he would return

504
00:24:49,697 --> 00:24:51,654
and complete his destiny,

505
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:54,528
but that would require
a particular knife.

506
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:56,652
This knife.

507
00:24:56,954 --> 00:24:58,070
A story.

508
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,320
As I said.

509
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:01,368
But to my people,

510
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:04,204
very meaningful.

511
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:08,664
I hope that satisfies your curiosity.

512
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,331
Some.

513
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:12,963
But you see, Minister,

514
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:15,845
my chief concern

515
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:20,551
is there's a boy,
the grandson of the curator.

516
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:22,260
He's being hunted.

517
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:25,722
Now, perhaps
that's because of the knife.

518
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:27,348
Or perhaps,

519
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:29,939
the killer thinks he saw something.

520
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:33,980
Did he?

521
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:36,607
No.

522
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:40,411
- Then he's safe.
- Yes, but you see,

523
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,534
I would have to know that
for certain

524
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:44,832
before I would do anything
that might affect the case.

525
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:46,455
Such as release the knife.

526
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,045
May I see the knife, Detective?

527
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:54,338
It would so set my mind at ease.

528

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

529
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:03,180

Gordon, where the hell is Bruce?

You!

533

- Alfred, back off!
- Wait, wait! Get your hands off me.

534
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:13,437
You don't know
what you've got in there.

535
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,271
I'm starting to,
but you are not helping.

536
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:16,731
I need you to calm down.

537
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,487
- Let me finish talking to him.
- Gordon.

538
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,238
- Not now!
- Gordon!

539
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:26,532
He's bloody vanished.

540
00:26:27,044 --> 00:26:28,455
He knows we don't have the knife.

541
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:30,541
We have to find Bruce.

542
00:26:32,216 --> 00:26:34,128

- Do not call me that.

543
00:26:34,218 --> 00:26:36,005
- You gotta hear us out.
- No, I don't.

544
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:38,844
I didn't invite you here.
We're not having this meeting.

545
00:26:39,056 --> 00:26:41,924
Now I'm gonna ask you,
please, politely, to leave.

546

We served your father for years.

547
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,931
When Penguin took over,
we had to go underground.

548
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,687
Then we heard a Falcone
was back in Gotham,

549
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:50,348
we knew it was time.

550
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:53,026
Did you ignore my father
like you're ignoring me?

551
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:54,856
I just told you to leave.

552
00:26:55,656 --> 00:26:57,192
Just tell us
when your father's coming back

553
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:58,614
to put that Penguin in his place.

554
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:01,652
Please understand me,
my father is not coming back.

555
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:02,945
This is Penguin's city.

556
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,074
And I want you to leave

557
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:06,872
- before he finds out you're here...
- Too late, I'm afraid.

558
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:10,410
Victor, how many graves did you dig?

559
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:12,328
Two.

560

You had me come to your club.

568
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:49,699
You knew word would get out.

569
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:51,625
That my father's loyalists
would find me.

570
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:53,669
I was a worm on your hook.

571
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:59,133
With one difference, my dear.

572
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:01,127
The worm is usually eaten.

573
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:03,504

You're alive, aren't you?

I would plant roses.
They cover up the smell.

576
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,567
My father wouldn't have
killed those men.

577
00:28:19,156 --> 00:28:22,274
He would've invited me to his club,
as you did, but then gone further.

578
00:28:22,743 --> 00:28:24,234
He would've invited me to dinners,

579
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:25,902
had us seen in public,

580

sent the message
that the old order supports me.

581
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:33,539
And those men you killed
would've pledged you loyalty.

about this knife.

because of it.

there wasn't a trace of blood.

to draw them out.

803
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:07,639
And killed them.
