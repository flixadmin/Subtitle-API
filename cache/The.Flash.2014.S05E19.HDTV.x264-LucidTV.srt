1
00:00:00,277 --> 00:00:01,710
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:01,713 --> 00:00:03,868
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:03,871 --> 00:00:05,109
To the outside world,

4
00:00:05,112 --> 00:00:07,005
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist.

5
00:00:07,008 --> 00:00:08,441
But secretly, with the help

6
00:00:08,443 --> 00:00:10,076
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

7
00:00:10,079 --> 00:00:12,043
I fight crime and
find other meta-humans

8
00:00:12,046 --> 00:00:13,218
like me.

9
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:15,390
But when my daughter came
back from the future to help,

10
00:00:15,393 --> 00:00:17,315
she changed the present

11
00:00:17,318 --> 00:00:20,153
and now our world is
more dangerous than ever.

12
00:00:20,156 --> 00:00:22,817
And I'm the only one
fast enough to save it.

13
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,257
I am the Flash.

14
00:00:26,194 --> 00:00:27,937
Previously on "The Flash"...

15
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:30,830
- Is my dad even really...
- Caitlin, your father is dead.

16
00:00:30,832 --> 00:00:32,331
- Dad?
- You found me.

17
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:33,899
I want to make it up to you, Caity.

18
00:00:33,901 --> 00:00:36,502
I really should've been there for you.

19
00:00:36,504 --> 00:00:38,571
Icicle wouldn't have
gone to all this trouble

20
00:00:38,573 --> 00:00:41,407
to kill my dad if there wasn't
a piece of him still left.

21
00:00:41,409 --> 00:00:43,442
We got Dwyer, we gave him the cure,

22
00:00:43,444 --> 00:00:44,877
but another Cicada showed up.

23
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,345
She wants to tell you her secret.

24
00:00:46,347 --> 00:00:47,913
Someone instructed you to do it.

25
00:00:47,915 --> 00:00:49,648
Eobard Thawne.

26
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,618
Dad, please don't do this!

27
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,054
Nora, if you try to
run back in time again,

28
00:00:55,056 --> 00:00:56,789
I will feel it in the Speed Force.

29
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:57,990
Good-bye, Nora.

30
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:06,298
You took our daughter
back to the future?

31
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,300
I didn't have any other choice.

32
00:01:08,302 --> 00:01:11,003
I? It's we, Barry.

33
00:01:11,005 --> 00:01:12,505
We. She's our daughter,

34
00:01:12,507 --> 00:01:13,806
- not just yours.
- I know that.

35
00:01:13,808 --> 00:01:15,274
But you left her there anyway?

36
00:01:15,276 --> 00:01:17,610
I can't trust her, Iris!

37
00:01:17,612 --> 00:01:19,353
That puts all of us in danger!

38
00:01:19,356 --> 00:01:21,747
That's how you feel, Barry.

39
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,057
What about asking how I feel?

40
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,583
I didn't think I had to!

41
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:28,009
Of course you didn't.

42
00:01:28,012 --> 00:01:29,341
Of course you didn't, Barry!

43
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:31,056
You always see one way through a problem

44
00:01:31,058 --> 00:01:32,345
and damn what I think.

45
00:01:32,348 --> 00:01:34,059
Wait, wait, what the
hell does that mean?

46
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:35,995
You know, we have been
through so much crap,

47
00:01:35,997 --> 00:01:37,563
we have been through so much therapy

48
00:01:37,565 --> 00:01:38,960
and you are still...

49
00:01:38,963 --> 00:01:40,941
Still making decisions
based on your emotions!

50
00:01:40,944 --> 00:01:43,067
'Cause I'm right this time!

51
00:01:47,681 --> 00:01:50,115
Flashpoint?

52
00:01:50,118 --> 00:01:52,109
Going to the Speed Force and leaving me?

53
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,578
Were you right those times too?

54
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:56,315
You think I wanted to do this?

55
00:01:56,317 --> 00:01:58,050
That this was easy?

56
00:01:58,052 --> 00:02:02,228
Seeing Nora looking at
me, asking for forgiveness

57
00:02:02,231 --> 00:02:05,332
knowing it might be the
last time I ever see her?

58
00:02:05,335 --> 00:02:09,061
What about the last time
that I get to see her, Barry?

59
00:02:09,063 --> 00:02:11,263
I didn't even get a
chance to say good-bye!

60
00:02:11,265 --> 00:02:14,200
Damn it, Iris, she
lied to us for months!

61
00:02:14,202 --> 00:02:15,875
And she explained why!

62
00:02:15,878 --> 00:02:18,303
That she was working with Thawne?

63
00:02:29,851 --> 00:02:32,051
That doesn't bother you.

64
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:37,423
No, it doesn't.

65
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:42,093
Maybe if he killed your
mother in front of you,

66
00:02:42,096 --> 00:02:44,096
you'd feel differently.

67
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:48,667
Maybe you feeling differently, Barry,

68
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,853
is why we should have made
this decision together.

69
00:02:50,856 --> 00:02:52,622
She just wanted to meet you, Barry.

70
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:54,161
The father that she never knew

71
00:02:54,164 --> 00:02:57,409
and there was one person who
could teach her how to do that.

72
00:02:57,411 --> 00:03:00,112
Is it really so hard to understand

73
00:03:00,114 --> 00:03:01,468
why she would go to him?

74
00:03:01,471 --> 00:03:03,382
Doesn't matter if I understand it.

75
00:03:04,729 --> 00:03:07,528
Thawne is manipulating her.

76
00:03:07,531 --> 00:03:11,724
He's on death row, Barry.
How is he manipulating her?

77
00:03:11,726 --> 00:03:16,328
You know, if this were
anybody else, you'd back me.

78
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,798
But because it's Nora,
because it's our daughter,

79
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,335
the person who finally
stopped hating you,

80
00:03:23,337 --> 00:03:26,872
you refuse to see how dangerous this is.

81
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:32,511
I mean, you talk about making
decisions based on emotion.

82
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:37,149
Look in the mirror.

83
00:03:57,004 --> 00:04:00,372
All those years without my father

84
00:04:00,374 --> 00:04:02,908
and you gave me a second chance.

85
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,845
And now I've lost him all over again.

86
00:04:05,847 --> 00:04:09,081
I failed you, Little Runner.

87
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:13,018
No, this is my fault.

88
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:16,222
I should've never lied to
them about working with you.

89
00:04:16,224 --> 00:04:19,158
Well, perhaps not.

90
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,962
I screwed everything up.

91
00:04:22,964 --> 00:04:24,997
And now I can't even
help them catch Cicada

92
00:04:24,999 --> 00:04:27,800
because my dad will know if
I run into the Speed Force.

93
00:04:27,802 --> 00:04:30,169
Mm-hmm.

94
00:04:30,171 --> 00:04:32,571
He most certainly will.

95
00:04:34,313 --> 00:04:35,726
Hey...

96
00:04:38,613 --> 00:04:41,013
Wait.

97
00:04:41,015 --> 00:04:44,332
You've run into the Speed
Force hundreds of times.

98
00:04:44,335 --> 00:04:46,852
And my father, other speedsters,

99
00:04:46,854 --> 00:04:49,688
they never felt you coming.

100
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,825
How did you do that?

101
00:04:52,827 --> 00:04:54,460
Thawne, tell me how you did it.

102
00:04:54,462 --> 00:04:56,195
- Nora.
- Tell me. Thawne!

103
00:04:56,197 --> 00:04:58,664
It's not for you.

104
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:02,101
I need to see my father.

105
00:05:02,103 --> 00:05:04,069
Please, if there is a way

106
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:06,605
I can go back in time
to see him undetected,

107
00:05:06,607 --> 00:05:08,574
you have to tell me how.

108
00:05:14,382 --> 00:05:16,815
I used to idolize your father.

109
00:05:18,119 --> 00:05:19,919
I wanted to be just like him.

110
00:05:19,921 --> 00:05:23,155
But that was not my fate.
I was to be the reverse.

111
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:26,458
Opposite of him...

112
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,661
in every way.

113
00:05:28,663 --> 00:05:31,497
So instead of tapping
into the Speed Force

114
00:05:31,499 --> 00:05:35,768
to access my powers...

115
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,803
I created my own.

116
00:05:37,805 --> 00:05:40,773
You created your own Speed Force?

117
00:05:40,775 --> 00:05:42,141
Yes, I did.

118
00:05:42,143 --> 00:05:44,276
And I can access it to go back in time?

119
00:05:44,278 --> 00:05:47,579
That and more.

120
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:49,815
Can you teach me how to use it?

121
00:05:51,686 --> 00:05:55,321
Well, I... I have to warn you, Nora.

122
00:05:55,323 --> 00:05:59,191
It's a little bit negative.

123
00:06:04,104 --> 00:06:06,950
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

124
00:06:11,305 --> 00:06:15,341
Hey, where is Cecile and Cisco?

125
00:06:15,343 --> 00:06:16,929
Cecile's relieving the nanny.

126
00:06:16,932 --> 00:06:18,577
And Cisco went to talk to Breacher

127
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:20,079
about how to track Cicada II.

128
00:06:20,081 --> 00:06:21,447
Okay.

129
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:23,449
Where's Iris?

130
00:06:23,451 --> 00:06:25,736
Uh, I honestly don't know.

131
00:06:25,739 --> 00:06:28,051
We're not really seeing
eye to eye right now.

132
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,022
Because?

133
00:06:30,024 --> 00:06:34,460
Because I took Nora home for good.

134
00:06:34,462 --> 00:06:38,364
- Nora's gone?
- Just like that?

135
00:06:38,366 --> 00:06:40,599
Well, only thing to do, really,

136
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:43,369
because Nora can't be trusted.

137
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:48,762
I can deduce from your
faces that you're upset,

138
00:06:48,765 --> 00:06:51,276
but you understand the
truth need to be exposed.

139
00:06:51,278 --> 00:06:53,846
Yes, we understand that.

140
00:06:53,848 --> 00:06:57,249
What you don't understand
is that this is a family.

141
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:59,685
You didn't include anyone in this.

142
00:06:59,687 --> 00:07:01,320
Oh, look. Baby Giraffe...

143
00:07:01,322 --> 00:07:03,590
Sherloque, you've done enough.

144
00:07:03,593 --> 00:07:04,790
- All right?
- Oh, I have not done enough.

145
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:06,348
We still have another Cicada to catch.

146
00:07:06,351 --> 00:07:08,228
Man, he says you've done enough.

147
00:07:10,031 --> 00:07:13,165
Well, perhaps I have.

148
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:18,303
I got to take this. Yeah?

149
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:20,472
Look since Cisco
didn't take me with him,

150
00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:22,408
I'm gonna round up the Cicada II files.

151
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:24,309
Cecile and I are going
to go over them tomorrow,

152
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:27,446
see if anything makes my nose wiggle.

153
00:07:30,985 --> 00:07:33,552
Are you gonna be okay?

154
00:07:33,554 --> 00:07:35,521
I honestly don't know.

155
00:07:35,523 --> 00:07:39,324
Guys, this is CCPD.
We've got a big problem.

156
00:07:42,897 --> 00:07:45,064
The nurses heard a crash
in the middle of the night

157
00:07:45,066 --> 00:07:46,231
but nobody saw anything.

158
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:48,200
By the time they got here,

159
00:07:48,202 --> 00:07:49,701
Grace was gone.

160
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:52,337
Judging by the thermal
warping in this glass,

161
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:56,542
an energy blast with a lot
of heat took out the window.

162
00:07:56,544 --> 00:07:58,610
But I don't really
think we need any clues

163
00:07:58,612 --> 00:08:00,913
to know who took her.

164
00:08:00,915 --> 00:08:03,382
Future Grace steals past Grace.

165
00:08:03,384 --> 00:08:05,390
I don't even know if
there's a police code

166
00:08:05,393 --> 00:08:07,086
for kidnapping yourself.

167
00:08:07,088 --> 00:08:08,582
Hey, what's it say?

168
00:08:08,585 --> 00:08:09,747
Grace's coma is stable.

169
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,946
As long as future Grace is
looking after younger Grace,

170
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:13,481
her life's not in any danger.

171
00:08:13,484 --> 00:08:16,662
We still have no way
to find either of them.

172
00:08:16,664 --> 00:08:19,098
Could things get any worse?

173
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:30,174
Working late, Dr. Tannhauser?

174
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:32,811
Or working early,
depending how you see it.

175
00:08:32,813 --> 00:08:34,580
Well, I stopped by to say good night.

176
00:08:34,582 --> 00:08:36,882
So I guess I'll say good morning.

177
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:38,817
Good morning, J.P.

178
00:08:46,494 --> 00:08:48,168
Get back! Hold it right there!

179
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,583
Thomas?

180
00:09:46,967 --> 00:09:48,434
I don't suppose Icicle

181
00:09:48,437 --> 00:09:50,379
left any frozen fingerprints behind?

182
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:52,187
No, but this docking station

183
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:55,222
is lined with a
carbon-filled Kapton polymide.

184
00:09:55,225 --> 00:09:57,058
NASA uses it to build probes

185
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,694
meant for the coldest reaches of space.

186
00:09:59,696 --> 00:10:01,675
There's a lot of fresh puddles in here.

187
00:10:01,678 --> 00:10:03,957
You think he stole whatever
kept this place cold?

188
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,575
- Try way beyond cold.
- Why would he want it?

189
00:10:06,578 --> 00:10:07,822
You're going to have to ask Carla

190
00:10:07,824 --> 00:10:09,225
when she's done filing the theft report

191
00:10:09,227 --> 00:10:10,926
or Caitlyn when she gets here.

192
00:10:10,929 --> 00:10:14,242
I'm not sure about much lately.

193
00:10:14,244 --> 00:10:17,311
Hey, Barr.

194
00:10:17,313 --> 00:10:20,515
Have you talked to Iris since she left?

195
00:10:20,517 --> 00:10:22,950
I'm just giving her some space.

196
00:10:22,952 --> 00:10:25,619
All right, just make sure
you don't give her too much.

197
00:10:25,622 --> 00:10:28,623
The right choice? What the
hell are you talking about?

198
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:31,926
You lied to me for 20 years
and told me my father was dead.

199
00:10:31,928 --> 00:10:33,528
How the hell is that the right choice?

200
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:36,264
Your father is trapped inside
an ice monster, Caitlyn.

201
00:10:36,266 --> 00:10:37,598
What was I supposed to do?

202
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,267
Split custody with him on the weekends?

203
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:41,335
I don't know. You could
try telling me the truth.

204
00:10:41,337 --> 00:10:43,304
But why tell your daughter anything?

205
00:10:43,306 --> 00:10:45,206
Funny, I don't recall you telling me

206
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:46,908
that you let the monster
out of the prison.

207
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:50,077
Because you never told
me he was in a prison!

208
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,346
And now all these years that
I could've been working on

209
00:10:52,348 --> 00:10:54,682
a cure for dad are gone!

210
00:10:54,684 --> 00:10:56,651
We may never get him back.

211
00:10:56,653 --> 00:10:59,020
Well, at least you
have someone to blame.

212
00:10:59,022 --> 00:11:00,988
Moms are always here for that.

213
00:11:07,964 --> 00:11:10,231
Are you okay?

214
00:11:10,233 --> 00:11:12,700
I will be as soon as we find Icicle.

215
00:11:12,702 --> 00:11:14,402
My mom told me what he stole.

216
00:11:14,404 --> 00:11:16,543
It's a prototype Cryo-Atomizer.

217
00:11:16,546 --> 00:11:19,742
- And what can he do with that?
- Nothing good.

218
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:23,311
My contacts upstate got nothing.

219
00:11:23,313 --> 00:11:25,379
I even tried Kritschgau
at the DOD. Nada.

220
00:11:25,381 --> 00:11:28,614
Nobody can spare the manpower
to help find Cicada 2.0.

221
00:11:28,617 --> 00:11:29,984
Hey, what about The Citizen?

222
00:11:29,986 --> 00:11:33,788
Any fresh leads on Cicada? Iris?

223
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:37,325
Hello? Um, Earth to Iris?

224
00:11:37,327 --> 00:11:39,093
Ralph, wait!

225
00:11:39,095 --> 00:11:43,476
"Barry, I don't know if I can
ever forgive you for this."

226
00:11:43,479 --> 00:11:45,166
I think you missed a comma there.

227
00:11:45,168 --> 00:11:46,834
Can you stay out of it for once?

228
00:11:46,836 --> 00:11:48,736
She's not kidding. Super mad.

229
00:11:48,738 --> 00:11:52,206
No. Look, um, Iris,

230
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:54,242
I know how Barry can be.

231
00:11:54,244 --> 00:11:56,010
But you guys are like

232
00:11:56,012 --> 00:11:58,813
the Meghan and Harry
of superhero royalty.

233
00:11:58,815 --> 00:12:00,915
Your love is eternal.

234
00:12:00,917 --> 00:12:02,950
- You two will talk and... and...
- We did talk.

235
00:12:02,952 --> 00:12:06,187
I want Nora to stay here, he doesn't.

236
00:12:06,189 --> 00:12:09,123
How do we solve that?

237
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:11,893
Okay, Iris, honey.

238
00:12:13,662 --> 00:12:17,230
I haven't always been in
the near-perfect relationship

239
00:12:17,233 --> 00:12:18,599
that I'm in now.

240
00:12:18,601 --> 00:12:21,002
So take it from someone with experience,

241
00:12:21,004 --> 00:12:25,306
the only way you two solve
this problem is together.

242
00:12:26,142 --> 00:12:28,976
And you're not going to
find your answers here.

243
00:12:32,215 --> 00:12:33,814
Yeah, you're right.

244
00:12:40,323 --> 00:12:42,429
- You need to go after her.
- Oh, come on.

245
00:12:42,432 --> 00:12:44,659
Give me a break. Have
you seen her right hook?

246
00:12:44,661 --> 00:12:47,361
Ralph, she's hurt, I know.

247
00:12:47,363 --> 00:12:50,187
But there's something more. I feel it.

248
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:53,700
She's determined.

249
00:12:53,703 --> 00:12:55,870
Reprogramming complete.

250
00:12:55,872 --> 00:12:57,939
The Time Sphere's navigation
core is now locked

251
00:12:57,941 --> 00:13:00,215
onto Nora West-Allen's
temporal signature.

252
00:13:00,218 --> 00:13:02,076
And you disabled the
tracker that Cisco installed

253
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:03,678
- into the Sphere?
- Yes.

254
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,680
However, there are still
alarms in S.T.A.R. Labs.

255
00:13:05,682 --> 00:13:07,882
If you wish to use the Sphere undetected,

256
00:13:07,884 --> 00:13:09,992
you must activate it off-site.

257
00:13:13,056 --> 00:13:15,556
Planning a trip?

258
00:13:15,558 --> 00:13:17,158
How did you get in here?

259
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,826
Followed you then
stretched under the door.

260
00:13:18,828 --> 00:13:20,027
By the way, was anybody ever gonna

261
00:13:20,029 --> 00:13:21,595
tell me about this secret room?

262
00:13:21,597 --> 00:13:23,531
What else do we got in here?
A bowling alley or something?

263
00:13:23,533 --> 00:13:25,266
Ralph, I don't have time for this.

264
00:13:25,268 --> 00:13:28,302
Actually, it looks like you
have all the time in the world.

265
00:13:30,907 --> 00:13:32,239
You're not gonna stop me.

266
00:13:32,241 --> 00:13:34,575
Who said anything about stopping you?

267
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,347
I'm in position.

268
00:13:39,349 --> 00:13:41,215
Thawne, I said I'm ready.

269
00:13:41,217 --> 00:13:43,084
We shall see if you're ready.

270
00:13:43,086 --> 00:13:44,986
Now run.

271
00:13:47,824 --> 00:13:50,157
Now listen to me, Nora.

272
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:52,727
Breathe. Breathe.

273
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:55,997
You're reaching out and nobody's there.

274
00:13:55,999 --> 00:13:57,631
The loneliness is pain.

275
00:13:57,633 --> 00:14:00,234
Pain racing through your mind.

276
00:14:00,236 --> 00:14:01,869
Crushing you, wrecking you,

277
00:14:01,871 --> 00:14:05,873
shattering your soul into
a million little pieces.

278
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:09,343
And suddenly, you are no longer you.

279
00:14:12,281 --> 00:14:15,416
You're part of something different now.

280
00:14:15,418 --> 00:14:17,952
Part of a negative force.

281
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:31,599
It didn't work.

282
00:14:31,601 --> 00:14:34,235
Thawne, why didn't it work?

283
00:14:39,342 --> 00:14:41,275
- Are you ready?
- All set to hit

284
00:14:41,277 --> 00:14:42,977
88 miles an hour!

285
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,447
Here we go.

286
00:14:49,452 --> 00:14:51,085
Open the time breach!

287
00:14:58,394 --> 00:15:00,795
Ralph, hurry up!

288
00:15:08,671 --> 00:15:10,504
So the Cryo-Atomizer has the ability

289
00:15:10,506 --> 00:15:13,074
to disperse particles
into the atmosphere.

290
00:15:13,076 --> 00:15:16,110
Particles that slow down
atoms to a grinding halt.

291
00:15:16,112 --> 00:15:18,479
- And the slower they get...
- The colder they get.

292
00:15:18,481 --> 00:15:20,514
- How cold are we talking?
- Absolute zero.

293
00:15:20,516 --> 00:15:23,350
And if we combine them
with Icicle's meta-powers...

294
00:15:23,352 --> 00:15:25,653
He could plunge Central
City into a new Ice Age.

295
00:15:25,655 --> 00:15:27,221
There is some good news.

296
00:15:27,223 --> 00:15:29,457
I think we can track
the nano-cryoparticles

297
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:31,058
inside the atomizer.

298
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:33,694
We just have to reprogram an
oscillating inversion scanner.

299
00:15:33,696 --> 00:15:35,663
Do you mind running to
the downstairs storage area

300
00:15:35,665 --> 00:15:37,484
- and grabbing it?
- Mm-hmm.

301
00:15:37,487 --> 00:15:40,453
Wait. You should use
a modified field array.

302
00:15:40,456 --> 00:15:42,103
There's one in the upstairs archives.

303
00:15:42,105 --> 00:15:43,737
No, no, actually the inversion scanner

304
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,094
would work best. Thank you.

305
00:15:45,097 --> 00:15:48,536
No, no. Not since we upgraded
our field arrays last year.

306
00:15:48,539 --> 00:15:50,277
You know you would know
that if you visited more,

307
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:51,734
not just when you needed something.

308
00:15:51,737 --> 00:15:54,447
Apparently, only when
I need the wrong thing.

309
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:57,618
- The inversion scanner.
- The field array.

310
00:16:02,158 --> 00:16:03,757
I'll get both.

311
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,459
Might take my time.

312
00:16:05,461 --> 00:16:06,994
You need help?

313
00:16:06,996 --> 00:16:08,362
No.

314
00:16:11,434 --> 00:16:15,870
Is it me or is it getting
really cold in here?

315
00:16:15,872 --> 00:16:17,404
Run!

316
00:16:38,304 --> 00:16:40,218
Two for one.

317
00:16:41,898 --> 00:16:46,066
So who wants a family reunion?

318
00:16:46,068 --> 00:16:48,235
Hm?

319
00:16:53,652 --> 00:16:58,088
Adieu, Team Flash.

320
00:17:07,032 --> 00:17:09,533
Barry. Barry, come on!

321
00:17:09,535 --> 00:17:12,836
Come on, Barr!

322
00:17:12,838 --> 00:17:14,404
I can barely feel his pulse.

323
00:17:14,406 --> 00:17:16,907
He has hypothermia. His
heart rate's dropping.

324
00:17:16,909 --> 00:17:19,075
We only have seconds to save him.

325
00:17:19,078 --> 00:17:21,478
- What are you doing?
- Well, this...

326
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,213
this machine has a large power source

327
00:17:23,215 --> 00:17:25,015
I need to access to save Monsieur Allen.

328
00:17:25,017 --> 00:17:27,751
Watch out.

329
00:17:27,753 --> 00:17:30,721
That'll work. Stand back.

330
00:17:30,723 --> 00:17:32,356
All right.

331
00:17:32,358 --> 00:17:34,695
This current should
heat up the copper wiring

332
00:17:34,698 --> 00:17:36,994
of his suit's circuitry and
we need to heat it up enough

333
00:17:36,996 --> 00:17:38,629
so that his speed healing kicks in.

334
00:17:38,631 --> 00:17:40,631
- Is this safe?
- Safer than dying.

335
00:17:40,633 --> 00:17:43,433
- Come on, Monsieur Allen.
- Barry?

336
00:17:43,435 --> 00:17:45,235
- Come on!
- Barr!

337
00:17:48,107 --> 00:17:49,740
Icicle. He has them.

338
00:17:49,742 --> 00:17:51,909
- No, no, no, no, Monsieur.
- No, no, wait. No, wait.

339
00:17:51,911 --> 00:17:54,378
In time. In time. First, you rest.

340
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:57,514
Then we bring them home together.

341
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,059
Where are we?

342
00:18:09,061 --> 00:18:12,095
In another decommissioned
Tannhauser site.

343
00:18:12,097 --> 00:18:15,165
This site is a little more
off-the-grid than usual.

344
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:17,734
It's where we kept our
most classified projects.

345
00:18:17,736 --> 00:18:21,505
Great. I guess we are
Icicle's next project.

346
00:18:21,507 --> 00:18:23,440
We need to get out of here.

347
00:18:23,442 --> 00:18:25,070
Well, there's a circuit panel over here.

348
00:18:25,073 --> 00:18:26,906
I think we can hack
it and open the door.

349
00:18:26,909 --> 00:18:29,146
Neither one of us knows
about electrical engineering.

350
00:18:29,148 --> 00:18:31,515
Our best bet is to break
me out of these meta-cuffs

351
00:18:31,517 --> 00:18:32,836
and let Killer Frost do the rest.

352
00:18:32,838 --> 00:18:34,718
Don't be foolish.
You'll never break those.

353
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,486
Well, it's no more foolish
than you electrocuting

354
00:18:36,488 --> 00:18:39,022
yourself, but if you want
to, knock yourself out.

355
00:18:39,024 --> 00:18:40,601
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

356
00:18:43,128 --> 00:18:45,662
How did we get here?

357
00:18:45,664 --> 00:18:48,031
I mean, you're my mother
and I'm your daughter.

358
00:18:48,033 --> 00:18:50,234
But it has never felt like that.

359
00:18:50,236 --> 00:18:52,502
You've always been cold, distant.

360
00:18:52,504 --> 00:18:54,705
You never wanted to
be a part of my life.

361
00:18:54,707 --> 00:18:57,407
Not then and certainly not now.

362
00:18:57,409 --> 00:18:58,909
Why?

363
00:18:58,911 --> 00:19:01,340
I mean, what did I ever do
to get treated like this?

364
00:19:01,343 --> 00:19:03,781
- What?
- Why did you leave me?

365
00:19:03,784 --> 00:19:05,615
You left me first.

366
00:19:05,618 --> 00:19:09,486
You went to school across the
country to get away from me.

367
00:19:09,488 --> 00:19:11,154
You took a job in Central City

368
00:19:11,156 --> 00:19:13,423
instead of working in the
same zip code as my lab.

369
00:19:13,425 --> 00:19:17,261
Caitlin, you were married
to a man I never even met.

370
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,630
I got the hint,

371
00:19:19,632 --> 00:19:22,532
but don't you dare mistake things.

372
00:19:22,534 --> 00:19:24,668
I didn't leave first.

373
00:19:28,221 --> 00:19:30,407
What are we doing here?
What do you want with us?

374
00:19:30,409 --> 00:19:33,477
I want what you could be.

375
00:19:33,479 --> 00:19:36,580
- Stop it!
- Just a small blood sample.

376
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:45,708
See you soon, Snow Pack.

377
00:19:50,362 --> 00:19:53,096
- What?
- Snow Pack.

378
00:19:53,098 --> 00:19:55,231
That was your father's
nickname for our family.

379
00:19:55,234 --> 00:19:58,535
I remember, and why is that scaring you?

380
00:19:59,638 --> 00:20:01,538
He said he wanted what we could be

381
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:03,206
and then he took a sample of your blood.

382
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:05,442
Theoretically, he could
use the Cryo-Atomizer

383
00:20:05,444 --> 00:20:08,512
to recreate the process
that created Killer Frost.

384
00:20:08,514 --> 00:20:11,481
- So if he did that to you...
- I would gain an ice persona.

385
00:20:11,483 --> 00:20:12,983
And now with a sample of my blood...

386
00:20:12,985 --> 00:20:14,117
He can create a serum

387
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,253
that will permanently
suppress our human sides.

388
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:18,188
He wants an ice family

389
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:20,090
and he's willing to erase us to get it.

390
00:20:25,797 --> 00:20:27,730
- Hold my suit.
- Oh, my God, Ralph.

391
00:20:27,733 --> 00:20:29,599
- Do you ever wash this thing?
- Focus, okay?

392
00:20:29,601 --> 00:20:32,102
You sure you're ready to talk
to "he who shall not be named"?

393
00:20:32,104 --> 00:20:33,737
Well, whether I am or not, Gideon said

394
00:20:33,739 --> 00:20:36,440
that these were Nora's
last known coordinates.

395
00:20:39,979 --> 00:20:42,045
You're up.

396
00:20:44,016 --> 00:20:46,550
Hey, bro.

397
00:20:46,552 --> 00:20:48,185
Uh, what a day. Am I right?

398
00:20:48,187 --> 00:20:50,988
You mind if I get a quick word
there with Hannibal Speedster?

399
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:53,991
It's just going to take, like, a second.

400
00:20:53,993 --> 00:20:55,492
Is that right?

401
00:20:55,494 --> 00:20:58,395
Well, unless you got a
signed Shift Change Order,

402
00:20:58,397 --> 00:21:01,865
nobody goes in there but me, bro.

403
00:21:01,867 --> 00:21:03,767
Only you, huh?

404
00:21:03,769 --> 00:21:06,670
Okay, if you insist.

405
00:21:12,678 --> 00:21:15,479
Hm. Oh, shrap.

406
00:21:17,082 --> 00:21:19,816
Oh. Ooh.

407
00:21:19,818 --> 00:21:21,151
You need to hurry.

408
00:21:21,153 --> 00:21:22,786
This guy's such a dick, I got to think

409
00:21:22,788 --> 00:21:25,756
super douchey thoughts
just to keep this face on.

410
00:21:29,128 --> 00:21:30,594
Douchey, douchey, douchey.

411
00:21:30,596 --> 00:21:33,964
I did everything
exactly like you told me.

412
00:21:33,966 --> 00:21:35,565
How come I can't do this?

413
00:21:35,567 --> 00:21:38,702
Listen, not harboring
enough rage to fuel your trip

414
00:21:38,704 --> 00:21:39,782
is not something to be ashamed of.

415
00:21:39,784 --> 00:21:40,976
You're just like your father.

416
00:21:40,979 --> 00:21:44,273
Your light is your greatest strength.

417
00:21:48,247 --> 00:21:50,156
- Nora.
- Mom?

418
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:53,383
Step away from him, please.

419
00:21:53,385 --> 00:21:55,452
Mom, it's okay.

420
00:21:55,454 --> 00:21:57,354
Eobard is helping me.

421
00:21:57,356 --> 00:21:59,289
He has a way for me to get back home.

422
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:02,359
Nora, step away from him now.

423
00:22:02,369 --> 00:22:06,337
Nora, listen to your mother.

424
00:22:10,836 --> 00:22:12,369
Where's Dad?

425
00:22:12,371 --> 00:22:14,404
It's just me.

426
00:22:14,406 --> 00:22:17,007
It's probably for the best.
Come on, we have to hurry.

427
00:22:17,009 --> 00:22:19,242
What do you mean it's
probably for the best?

428
00:22:19,244 --> 00:22:20,877
Nora, the last thing your father needs

429
00:22:20,879 --> 00:22:22,946
is to see you here with him.

430
00:22:22,948 --> 00:22:24,948
She's right about that.

431
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:26,183
No.

432
00:22:26,185 --> 00:22:28,552
No, she's not, and neither is my dad.

433
00:22:28,554 --> 00:22:30,195
Nora, your dad was wrong,

434
00:22:30,198 --> 00:22:31,888
but he still cares about you.

435
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:33,690
Why are you here and he isn't?

436
00:22:33,692 --> 00:22:35,492
Look, I understand how you feel...

437
00:22:35,494 --> 00:22:36,827
Do you?

438
00:22:36,829 --> 00:22:39,196
Do you know what it's
like to want something more

439
00:22:39,198 --> 00:22:41,226
than anything else in your whole life?

440
00:22:41,229 --> 00:22:43,133
To know your father?

441
00:22:43,135 --> 00:22:46,069
To do your best to
follow in his footsteps?

442
00:22:46,071 --> 00:22:48,071
To make him proud?

443
00:22:49,475 --> 00:22:50,807
How could he leave me?

444
00:22:50,809 --> 00:22:52,625
- Wait, wait! That's enough!
- Nora.

445
00:22:52,628 --> 00:22:54,810
How could he stop loving me?

446
00:23:17,503 --> 00:23:20,137
No!

447
00:23:23,475 --> 00:23:24,975
It's always the same condescending

448
00:23:24,977 --> 00:23:27,544
"I know better than you" crap.

449
00:23:27,546 --> 00:23:28,845
And you never change!

450
00:23:28,847 --> 00:23:30,113
She's trying to kill me.

451
00:23:32,651 --> 00:23:35,285
- Who else knows?
- Everyone.

452
00:23:35,287 --> 00:23:36,625
It's time for you to go home.

453
00:23:36,628 --> 00:23:37,859
Good-bye, Nora.

454
00:23:37,862 --> 00:23:39,937
Goodbye, Nora. Goodbye, Nora.

455
00:23:44,819 --> 00:23:46,085
She's gone.

456
00:23:46,088 --> 00:23:47,698
What the hell do you mean she's gone?

457
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,266
- Gone where?
- I don't know where.

458
00:23:49,268 --> 00:23:51,201
I only know when. 2019.

459
00:23:52,738 --> 00:23:56,206
When Nora said you
showed her a way back...

460
00:23:56,208 --> 00:23:57,808
she meant your way.

461
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:00,410
Yes. And I made a mistake.

462
00:24:00,412 --> 00:24:02,479
She wanted to go home,
I tried to help her.

463
00:24:02,481 --> 00:24:04,281
But listen, Iris, you have to find her.

464
00:24:04,283 --> 00:24:05,849
She needs her family.

465
00:24:05,851 --> 00:24:09,019
And that family does not include you.

466
00:24:09,021 --> 00:24:11,488
But it does include Barry.

467
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:13,824
She needs you both united.

468
00:24:13,826 --> 00:24:15,659
I'm only going to say this once.

469
00:24:15,661 --> 00:24:17,761
You don't get to comment on us.

470
00:24:17,763 --> 00:24:19,463
You stay the hell out of our business

471
00:24:19,465 --> 00:24:21,398
or you won't even make it
to the end of that timer.

472
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,967
I like your anger,

473
00:24:23,969 --> 00:24:26,570
but don't let it drive Barry away.

474
00:24:26,572 --> 00:24:28,739
The only way for you to help Nora

475
00:24:28,741 --> 00:24:30,340
is by doing it as a family.

476
00:24:30,342 --> 00:24:35,412
Otherwise, you're simply leaving Barry

477
00:24:35,414 --> 00:24:38,048
the exact same way he left Nora.

478
00:24:40,686 --> 00:24:44,388
Iris, we got to bail.
They found Officer Jackass.

479
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:47,257
Think about it.

480
00:24:47,259 --> 00:24:48,792
Iris, please.

481
00:25:05,043 --> 00:25:09,212
What's it like having
another person in your head?

482
00:25:09,214 --> 00:25:10,747
Pretty crazy.

483
00:25:10,749 --> 00:25:12,949
I mean, when she first showed up,

484
00:25:12,951 --> 00:25:14,484
I couldn't wait to get rid of her,

485
00:25:14,486 --> 00:25:18,054
but when she disappeared,

486
00:25:18,056 --> 00:25:20,616
I tried even harder to get her back.

487
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:24,428
What finally brought her back?

488
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:26,696
Family.

489
00:25:26,698 --> 00:25:28,598
She protected us.

490
00:25:29,802 --> 00:25:32,269
Well, I'm glad you had
someone there for you.

491
00:25:34,072 --> 00:25:38,108
Hey, Mom, that was pretty
clever what you did.

492
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:40,277
Figuring out Icicle's plan.

493
00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:43,180
Well, I recall you helped with that too.

494
00:25:43,182 --> 00:25:45,482
It's amazing what we can do

495
00:25:45,484 --> 00:25:48,652
when we're not trying to
rip each other's heads off.

496
00:25:52,332 --> 00:25:53,717
Stay away from her.

497
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,368
I'll come back for her later.

498
00:25:55,371 --> 00:25:58,462
First, we have some catching up to do.

499
00:25:58,464 --> 00:25:59,996
What?

500
00:25:59,998 --> 00:26:01,832
No!

501
00:26:02,935 --> 00:26:04,835
Caitlyn!

502
00:26:14,277 --> 00:26:16,446
There's no leads.

503
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:19,534
There's no hits on
Icicle's cryosignature,

504
00:26:19,537 --> 00:26:21,418
no reads on facial recognition, nothing.

505
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,153
Barr, we'll find him. We always do.

506
00:26:23,155 --> 00:26:25,222
How, Joe? How are we gonna find them?

507
00:26:25,224 --> 00:26:26,590
Caitlyn's kidnapped.

508
00:26:26,592 --> 00:26:27,858
We need Caitlyn to find Caitlyn.

509
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,192
Cisco's on another Earth

510
00:26:29,202 --> 00:26:30,956
and Iris won't even answer my calls!

511
00:26:30,959 --> 00:26:33,059
I...

512
00:26:33,062 --> 00:26:35,265
I don't know how to fix any of this.

513
00:26:35,267 --> 00:26:36,900
If I might?

514
00:26:36,902 --> 00:26:38,902
It occurs to me that hiding

515
00:26:38,904 --> 00:26:41,771
a needle in a haystack is good.

516
00:26:41,773 --> 00:26:43,807
Hiding a needle in a stack of needles?

517
00:26:43,809 --> 00:26:46,409
That's better.

518
00:26:48,213 --> 00:26:50,547
These are all the
cold spots in the area.

519
00:26:50,549 --> 00:26:52,916
You think Icicle is
masking his cryo-signature

520
00:26:52,918 --> 00:26:54,451
with someplace that's already cold?

521
00:26:54,453 --> 00:26:56,119
Giving him the perfect cover.

522
00:26:56,121 --> 00:26:57,587
So we just refocus our search,

523
00:26:57,589 --> 00:26:59,331
look for temperature anomalies

524
00:26:59,334 --> 00:27:01,492
in already existing
cold spots, et voila.

525
00:27:01,495 --> 00:27:05,462
This is great. I'll start
retasking the satellites.

526
00:27:05,464 --> 00:27:08,231
- Hey, thanks for your help.
- The least I can do.

527
00:27:08,233 --> 00:27:10,200
I've got a cold spike.

528
00:27:13,539 --> 00:27:15,906
That's quite a stack of needles.

529
00:27:24,323 --> 00:27:27,183
Thomas, are you in there?

530
00:27:27,185 --> 00:27:29,619
Thomas, please.

531
00:27:31,455 --> 00:27:35,691
Now it's time to meet your better half.

532
00:27:48,841 --> 00:27:50,941
Perfection.

533
00:27:50,943 --> 00:27:52,417
Boo.

534
00:27:58,384 --> 00:28:01,385
How did you get out?

535
00:28:01,387 --> 00:28:03,605
Me? I just raised my hands.

536
00:28:03,608 --> 00:28:05,623
You were the one who froze my cuffs

537
00:28:05,625 --> 00:28:08,158
so they shattered like glass.

538
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,460
Clever, Caitlyn.

539
00:28:09,462 --> 00:28:12,129
I'm almost gonna miss
her when she's dead.

540
00:28:16,836 --> 00:28:19,703
No turning back now.
Time to make a choice.

541
00:28:19,705 --> 00:28:22,072
You either save her...

542
00:28:23,533 --> 00:28:25,400
Or fight me.

543
00:28:35,454 --> 00:28:36,887
Save her.

544
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:40,090
I'm gonna go get him.

545
00:29:05,251 --> 00:29:07,351
Okay, explain again
why I'm here doing this

546
00:29:07,353 --> 00:29:08,706
and not anybody else?

547
00:29:08,709 --> 00:29:10,854
It appears we're a bit
short staffed at the moment.

548
00:29:10,856 --> 00:29:12,508
All right, if it's
just us, it's just us.

549
00:29:12,511 --> 00:29:13,907
- Let's do this.
- Let's do this thing.

550
00:29:13,909 --> 00:29:15,326
- What's happening?
- Oh, great timing.

551
00:29:15,328 --> 00:29:17,061
Oh, yeah, good timing. Oh, you do this.

552
00:29:17,063 --> 00:29:18,462
Okay, Icicle has Caitlyn

553
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:20,659
and her mom in some caves
north of the Badlands.

554
00:29:20,662 --> 00:29:22,316
Well, the Flash is already on the scene.

555
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:24,567
So for all we know, the
problem is already solved.

556
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:26,770
- Guys, I have a problem.
- Or not.

557
00:29:26,772 --> 00:29:28,772
I need to phase Carla
out of a cryo-chamber

558
00:29:28,774 --> 00:29:30,641
but it's too cold. I
can't even touch it.

559
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:32,242
All right, we need heat fast.

560
00:29:32,244 --> 00:29:34,111
What if he generates a lightning bolt?

561
00:29:34,113 --> 00:29:35,828
He can't throw a bolt.
That would kill her.

562
00:29:35,831 --> 00:29:37,948
Then why doesn't he
just, uh, hold onto it?

563
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:39,917
- That could kill him!
- No, no. He's right.

564
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:42,805
The lightning cannot hurt
you if you are in phase.

565
00:29:42,808 --> 00:29:44,555
If half my molecules are in phase,

566
00:29:44,557 --> 00:29:46,323
the electricity would
hop from stable molecule

567
00:29:46,325 --> 00:29:48,692
- to stable molecule.
- Creating an electronic bridge

568
00:29:48,694 --> 00:29:50,527
that will generate the heat
that you need, et viola.

569
00:29:50,529 --> 00:29:52,162
Without electrocuting
him, he can phase in,

570
00:29:52,164 --> 00:29:53,497
grab her, and then phase out.

571
00:29:53,499 --> 00:29:55,699
All in 3/10s of a second.

572
00:29:55,701 --> 00:29:57,234
Uh-huh.

573
00:30:15,253 --> 00:30:17,654
I got you. I got you.

574
00:30:17,656 --> 00:30:19,886
I'm going to warm her up, all right?

575
00:30:56,629 --> 00:30:58,796
What a waste.

576
00:31:03,035 --> 00:31:06,403
I wanted to make you perfect.

577
00:31:06,405 --> 00:31:09,652
Now I must end you.

578
00:31:18,344 --> 00:31:20,191
Impossible.

579
00:31:40,562 --> 00:31:42,028
Caity?

580
00:31:42,031 --> 00:31:43,640
Dad?

581
00:31:43,642 --> 00:31:45,576
Are you okay?

582
00:31:45,578 --> 00:31:48,612
Is it you? Is it really you?

583
00:31:48,614 --> 00:31:50,948
It's me.

584
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,817
- It's really me.
- Oh. Oh, my God.

585
00:32:06,298 --> 00:32:09,464
You're going to be okay. You
just need to take it slow.

586
00:32:14,868 --> 00:32:16,568
Thomas?

587
00:32:17,564 --> 00:32:19,131
My God!

588
00:32:22,354 --> 00:32:23,887
- Are you...
- I'm okay.

589
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:25,715
I took a beating but Killer Frost

590
00:32:25,718 --> 00:32:27,150
ice healing kicked in.

591
00:32:27,152 --> 00:32:29,853
I'm going to be fine thanks to Dad.

592
00:32:29,855 --> 00:32:31,889
Well, how... how is this possible?

593
00:32:31,891 --> 00:32:34,391
Well, I saw Icicle
about to kill Caitlyn,

594
00:32:34,393 --> 00:32:36,727
and I found the strength
to break through.

595
00:32:36,729 --> 00:32:39,563
Just like Killer Frost, Dad saved me.

596
00:32:39,565 --> 00:32:41,164
Well, you saved me too, Caitlyn.

597
00:32:41,166 --> 00:32:42,633
I mean, thanks to you, I think

598
00:32:42,635 --> 00:32:44,635
I may have finally
banished this monster.

599
00:32:48,748 --> 00:32:51,073
That's good.

600
00:32:51,076 --> 00:32:54,678
That just leaves one more
monster for me to kill.

601
00:32:57,082 --> 00:32:58,448
Run!

602
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,394
Get out of here. I'll take care of this.

603
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:17,727
Cool knife. I've got two.

604
00:33:50,669 --> 00:33:53,203
Caitlyn, run!

605
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:07,274
Dad? Dad. Please.

606
00:34:10,016 --> 00:34:12,016
Caitlyn.

607
00:34:13,258 --> 00:34:14,658
Dad, I told you to go.

608
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:16,627
I already left once before.

609
00:34:16,629 --> 00:34:19,096
Left both of you.

610
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:22,366
Worst mistake I've ever
made in my entire life.

611
00:34:23,202 --> 00:34:25,535
I wasn't going to make that again.

612
00:34:27,272 --> 00:34:30,874
Family shouldn't leave family.

613
00:34:37,349 --> 00:34:39,349
I'll always love you.

614
00:34:55,025 --> 00:34:56,625
How's Caitlyn and her mom?

615
00:34:56,627 --> 00:34:58,260
Caitlin's still running some tests,

616
00:34:58,262 --> 00:34:59,995
but she thinks Carla's gonna be okay.

617
00:34:59,998 --> 00:35:03,536
I mean, as okay as she can
be given the circumstances.

618
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:07,402
Why was Cicada II even there tonight?

619
00:35:07,404 --> 00:35:09,938
I mean, why attack Icicle and Caitlin?

620
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:12,441
Perhaps the ice meta were
not the primary target.

621
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:15,431
What could Cicada II want
with the Cryo-Atomizer?

622
00:35:15,434 --> 00:35:16,849
Well, we're not gonna
figure it out tonight.

623
00:35:16,851 --> 00:35:18,770
So let's rest tonight.

624
00:35:18,773 --> 00:35:20,418
Are you coming back to the house?

625
00:35:20,421 --> 00:35:22,654
Um...

626
00:35:24,021 --> 00:35:26,621
No, I'm gonna stay at the loft tonight.

627
00:35:27,958 --> 00:35:29,958
You are?

628
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,493
Yeah.

629
00:35:31,495 --> 00:35:33,362
We should talk.

630
00:35:36,898 --> 00:35:38,430
Awkward a bit.

631
00:35:38,433 --> 00:35:40,634
So you went to the future?

632
00:35:40,637 --> 00:35:43,804
Yeah. John Stamos still handsome.

633
00:35:43,807 --> 00:35:45,240
He'll never not age.

634
00:35:45,242 --> 00:35:48,677
No, never. Man, he looks good.

635
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:50,846
So this endothermic litmus test

636
00:35:50,848 --> 00:35:52,881
would've created a
stoichiometric reaction.

637
00:35:52,883 --> 00:35:56,284
If there was any residual
meta DNA in your system, it...

638
00:35:56,286 --> 00:35:59,247
Would've turned white. I know.

639
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:02,580
And it's still green, so you're clean.

640
00:36:02,583 --> 00:36:05,017
You're not a meta.

641
00:36:07,297 --> 00:36:10,632
Those were all the clues
that I used to find dad.

642
00:36:11,602 --> 00:36:14,069
Including some files
that I may have stolen

643
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:15,504
from your file room.

644
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:23,445
Aww, Caitlin and Thomas
infamous Periodic Table.

645
00:36:23,447 --> 00:36:25,680
Nerdonium.

646
00:36:25,682 --> 00:36:27,416
You know, he stole that one from me.

647
00:36:27,418 --> 00:36:29,451
Really? I thought he came up with that

648
00:36:29,453 --> 00:36:31,319
while he was fixing the kitchen sink.

649
00:36:31,321 --> 00:36:34,389
No, I thought of that.

650
00:36:34,391 --> 00:36:37,726
Come to think of it, I
also fixed the kitchen sink.

651
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:42,355
Well, I... I better be going.

652
00:36:44,234 --> 00:36:46,068
Good night, Caity.

653
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:52,809
Mom? Um...

654
00:36:54,678 --> 00:36:57,813
Do you want to maybe go get a drink?

655
00:36:57,815 --> 00:37:02,350
You can tell me more about
elements you invented.

656
00:37:02,352 --> 00:37:06,021
Now or whenever.

657
00:37:06,023 --> 00:37:10,425
No, actually, now would be perfect.

658
00:37:15,298 --> 00:37:18,043
There's a little wine
bar around the corner.

659
00:37:18,046 --> 00:37:19,501
Mm-hmm.

660
00:37:31,114 --> 00:37:33,914
Heading home?

661
00:37:33,917 --> 00:37:37,385
Well, it's like Barry said... and Joe...

662
00:37:37,387 --> 00:37:39,788
- I've done enough.
- They did say that.

663
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:42,157
But you hung around anyway.

664
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:43,658
Oui, I did.

665
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:47,062
You were there for
Barry when he needed you.

666
00:37:47,064 --> 00:37:49,364
Oui, I was.

667
00:37:49,366 --> 00:37:51,066
And you helped saved Caitlyn's mom.

668
00:37:51,068 --> 00:37:53,001
Yes, that's right. I
did all those things.

669
00:37:53,003 --> 00:37:54,970
I should not have done those things?

670
00:37:54,972 --> 00:37:57,706
I'm just saying maybe
you have more to do...

671
00:37:59,676 --> 00:38:01,643
For your family.

672
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:23,059
I just wanted my family back together.

673
00:38:23,062 --> 00:38:25,332
Even if that meant
doing something drastic

674
00:38:25,335 --> 00:38:27,568
like time travel.

675
00:38:28,906 --> 00:38:31,106
Yeah, I get that.

676
00:38:31,108 --> 00:38:32,908
More than anyone.

677
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:35,710
You were right about Thawne.

678
00:38:35,712 --> 00:38:38,113
I think he's manipulating Nora,

679
00:38:38,115 --> 00:38:41,149
but I also believe him.

680
00:38:42,423 --> 00:38:45,324
Nora is back here in our time.

681
00:38:53,762 --> 00:38:56,330
I was...

682
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:57,732
Wrong.

683
00:38:57,735 --> 00:39:00,401
I shouldn't have left Nora

684
00:39:00,404 --> 00:39:05,607
or made that decision without you.

685
00:39:05,609 --> 00:39:09,434
Whatever it is that
we have to figure out,

686
00:39:09,437 --> 00:39:12,268
we should've done it together.

687
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:16,394
Family doesn't leave family.

688
00:39:19,576 --> 00:39:22,944
Well, I mean you weren't the
only one to make that mistake.

689
00:39:24,627 --> 00:39:27,434
I shouldn't have gone to
the future without you.

690
00:39:27,437 --> 00:39:29,137
I shouldn't have left you like that.

691
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:32,775
I mean, that was the same thing
that I got so mad at you for.

692
00:39:32,778 --> 00:39:37,347
But I know now that we can't solve this

693
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:39,417
if we don't stick together.

694
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:42,643
I can barely solve things with you,

695
00:39:42,646 --> 00:39:44,813
so without you...

696
00:39:44,815 --> 00:39:48,250
Are we making jokes already? Really?

697
00:39:51,155 --> 00:39:53,522
Let's bring our kid home.

698
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:59,961
There's something else
that I wanted to tell you.

699
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:05,734
Barry, the way that Thawne
looks when he talks about Nora.

700
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:10,405
I've only ever seen
that in one other person.

701
00:40:11,708 --> 00:40:13,075
You.

702
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:16,378
What are you saying?

703
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:19,915
I think Thawne might
actually care about Nora.

704
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:18,540
Soon, Grace.

705
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:20,481
Soon.

706
00:41:20,484 --> 00:41:28,570
