1
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,632
-We shouldn't be out here alone.
-Why not?

2
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:14,510
-If your father--
-He'll never know we're gone.

3
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:16,428
But if he finds out…

4
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,810
You don't need to be afraid of my father.

5
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:51,338
Are you sure?

6
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:53,715
Yes.

7
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:57,219
-We shouldn't go in.
-Of course we should.

8
00:03:42,014 --> 00:03:44,391
Get out. Get out!

9
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,226
-Let's go.
-No.

10
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:48,520
Listen to your friend.

11
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:54,902
They said that you were terrifying...
with cat's teeth and three eyes.

12
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:57,237
You're not terrifying.

13
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:00,532
You're boring.

14
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:03,160
You don't know what I am.

15
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:06,705
I know you're a witch
and you can see the future.

16
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:12,002
-Tell me mine.
-Everyone wants to know their future

17
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:17,549
-until they know their future.
-This is my father's land. My land.

18
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:21,678
Tell me my future
or I'll have your two boring eyes

19
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:23,013
gouged out of your head.

20
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:33,565
Your blood.

21
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:36,735
Give me a taste.

22
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:03,929
Three questions you get.

23
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,765
You won't like the answers.

24
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:12,854
I've been promised to the prince.

25
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:18,026
-When will we marry?
-You will never wed the prince.

26
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:21,613
-You will wed the king.
-But I will be queen?

27
00:05:21,697 --> 00:05:22,823
Oh, yes.

28
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:25,325
You'll be queen.

29
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:27,911
For a time.

30
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:30,622
Then comes another…

31
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:35,210
younger, more beautiful,

32
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:39,047
to cast you down
and take all you hold dear.

33
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:44,928
-W… will the king and I have children?
-No. The king will have 20 children,

34
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:47,556
and you will have three.

35
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:50,058
-That doesn't make sense.
-Gold will be their crowns.

36
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:54,604
Gold their shrouds.

37
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:03,572
Come on, we have to go.

38
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,200
We have to go! Cersei!

39
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:12,831
Bearers, put it down.

40
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:33,143
Bearers, up. Away.

41
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:50,035
Your Grace, we are honored
by your presence.

42
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:52,621
-The mourners are waiting.
-They will keep waiting.

43
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:55,499
I want a moment alone with him.

44
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:58,418
But, Your Grace, many of these lords
and ladies have travelled

45
00:06:58,502 --> 00:07:01,004
day and night to be here
from all seven kingdoms.

46
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:02,005
They will wait.

47
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,785
He never wanted you to be a Kingsguard,

48
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,621
but here you are,
protecting his dead body.

49
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:41,086
What he built, it's ours.

50
00:07:42,838 --> 00:07:45,132
He built it for us. He meant it for us.

51
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,928
They're going to try to take it away.
All of it.

52
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:52,806
-They?
-All of them out there, our enemies.

53
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:55,892
They're waiting in line to make sure
he's really dead.

54
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,936
And as soon as they see the stones
on his eyes,

55
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:00,772
-they'll set to work on tearing us apart.
-They have nothing to do with it.

56
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:04,568
The man who murdered our father,
he tore us apart.

57
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:07,028
He's the enemy. I've been telling you
for years.

58
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:10,073
-You've been defending him for years.
-This is exactly what they want.

59
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:11,408
And now our father is dead,

60
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:15,412
and that little monster is out there
somewhere drawing breath.

61
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:18,874
Did you set him free?

62
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:23,962
Tyrion may be a monster,

63
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,882
but at least he killed our father
on purpose.

64
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:31,261
You killed him by mistake. With stupidity.

65
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,015
You're a man of action, aren't you?

66
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:37,309
When it occurs to you to do something,
you do it.

67
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,144
Never mind the consequences.

68
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:43,648
Take a look.

69
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,359
Look at the consequences.

70
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,197
Here they are.

71
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:57,329
He loved you more than anyone
in this world.

72
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:31,589
Apologies.

73
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:45,437
I still don't see why I had to stay

74
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,816
-in this fucking crate once we set sail.
-I saved your life.

75
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:52,527
If they catch you, they catch me.

76
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:57,324
I cannot say I feel overly guilty
about leaving you in that fucking crate.

77
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:00,201
Do you know what it's like
to stuff your shit

78
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:01,536
through one of those air holes?

79
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:03,830
No, I only know what it's like

80
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,957
to pick up your shit
and throw it overboard.

81
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:10,587
Pentos?

82
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:18,636
The home of my colleague Illyrio Mopatis,
a merchant. He and I met many years ago

83
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,138
through mutual friends.

84
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:25,185
A group of people who saw Robert Baratheon
for the disaster he was.

85
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:30,273
We tried to do what was best for the realm
by supporting a Targaryen restoration.

86
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:35,487
And thus began the chain of mistakes
that has led us both here.

87
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:43,078
Things have gotten worse, not better.
Westeros needs to be saved from itself.

88
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:51,503
-Much better.
-My lord?

89
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:56,674
I don't think I am anymore.

90
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:58,635
A lord.

91
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,604
Are you a lord if you kill your father?

92
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:15,985
I don't imagine they revoke your nobility
for killing a whore.

93
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,196
It must happen all the time.

94
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,449
You already drank yourself
across the Narrow Sea.

95
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:23,284
In a box. Why stop now?

96
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:26,037
Because we are talking
about the future of our country.

97
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,627
The future is shit.

98
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:36,714
Just like the past.

99
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:47,155
-Sons of the Harpy?
-Yes, Your Grace.

100
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:49,657
-They left it on the body.
-They've never killed before.

101
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:54,704
It was only a matter of time, Your Grace.
Conquerors are always met with resistance.

102
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,998
I didn't conquer them.
Their own people did.

103
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,925
He did not risk his life
fighting for his freedom

104
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:09,886
so cowards in masks could take it away.

105
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,055
And I did not take up residence
in this pyramid

106
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:14,932
so I could watch the city below
decline into chaos.

107
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:17,685
What was the name of the man you lost?

108
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:20,438
White Rat, Your Grace.

109
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:26,694
I want him buried with honor, publicly,
in the Temple of the Graces.

110
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:29,697
The Sons of the Harpy
will hear that message.

111
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:32,909
-Make them very angry.
-Angry snakes lash out.

112
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:35,703
Makes chopping off their heads
that much easier.

113
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:39,207
Find the men who did this
and bring them to me.

114
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:44,337
Your Grace.

115
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:01,854
-Torgo Nudho.
-Missandei hin Naath.

116
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,817
I wanted to speak with you.

117
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:15,910
Why do you come?

118
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:19,455
White Rat, the Unsullied who…

119
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,961
I have heard they found his body
in a brothel.

120
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:29,507
I have heard that more than one Unsullied

121
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:32,218
has been known to visit
Meereen's brothels.

122
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:36,514
May I ask you why?

123
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,810
Why would an Unsullied go to a brothel?

124
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,566
I do not know.

125
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:50,319
I must go.

126
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:08,880
-Get your shield up.
-It's too heavy.

127
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:11,424
If it wasn't heavy, it wouldn't stop
a sword. Now get it up.

128
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:26,647
Come. Try it again.

129
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:31,486
Drive at me. Keep your shield up.
Or I'll ring your head like a bell.

130
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:34,238
Shouldn't you be training, too?

131
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:38,534
Well, I'm hardly a new recruit.

132
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:43,498
How many brothers can say
that they've killed a White Walker

133
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:46,417
and a Thenn?
I might be the first in history.

134
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:49,045
-Shield up.
-These men need a firm hand.

135
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:52,924
Always have. They're poachers and thieves.

136
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:56,844
Not soldiers.

137
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:04,477
That one hates me.

138
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:09,190
If Ser Alliser is chosen
as the new Lord Commander,

139
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:11,359
he hates the wildlings.

140
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,445
All the wildlings.

141
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:16,906
-Don't let them send us away.
-It's not a sure thing.

142
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:20,076
Ser Denys Mallister has commanded
the Shadow Tower for 20 years,

143
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,494
and people say he's a good man.

144
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:25,456
-He's running against Ser Alliser--
-Sam, don't let them send us away.

145
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,499
I told you.

146
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:32,004
-Wherever you go, I go too.
-You can't leave. They'll execute you.

147
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:41,681
Good, good. Pivot. Don't forget to pivot.

148
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:44,892
Shield up.

149
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:48,729
The king wants a word.

150
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,678
-You're not cold, my lady?
-Never.

151
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:24,640
The Lord's fire lives within me, Jon Snow.

152
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:28,811
Feel.

153
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,404
Are you a virgin?

154
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:43,576
No.

155
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:47,204
Good.

156
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:55,755
Your Grace.

157
00:20:57,006 --> 00:20:58,341
The bastard of Winterfell.

158
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:09,810
You know who rules at Winterfell now?

159
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:12,521
Roose Bolton.

160
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:15,942
The traitor who plunged a dagger
in Robb Stark's heart.

161
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,195
Don't you want to avenge him?

162
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:22,865
I want a great many things, Your Grace.

163
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:26,202
But I'm a sworn brother
of the Night's Watch now.

164
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:28,746
I've been talking to your sworn brothers.

165
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,666
-Many of them love you.
-They're good men.

166
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:32,667
Many don't.

167
00:21:33,668 --> 00:21:37,213
You were seen taking the body
of a wildling girl north of the Wall.

168
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:40,174
-Why?
-It's where she belonged.

169
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:44,053
Some of the Night's Watch feel you have
too much affection for the wildlings.

170
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,972
They were born on the wrong side
of the Wall.

171
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:48,683
That doesn't make them monsters.

172
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:53,062
No matter. I shall take back the North
from the thieves who stole it.

173
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,773
Tywin Lannister is dead.
He can't protect them now.

174
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:58,651
I shall mount Roose Bolton's head
on a spike.

175
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:01,654
But if I'm to take Winterfell,
I need more men.

176
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:04,865
The men of the Night's Watch
are sworn to play no part--

177
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:06,492
I'm not talking
about the damn Night's Watch.

178
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:08,160
I'm talking about the wildlings.

179
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:22,174
Your Grace, you want the wildlings
to march in your army?

180
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,760
If they swear to follow me,
I'll pardon them.

181
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:26,679
We'll take Winterfell.
Once the North is won,

182
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:29,724
I'll declare them citizens of the realm.
I'll give them land to live on.

183
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:33,436
It's a fair offer. More than fair.

184
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:35,980
I'll offer them their lives
and their freedom

185
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:38,858
if Mance kneels before me
and swears his loyalty.

186
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:40,568
I don't think that's likely.

187
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,321
You admire him, don't you?

188
00:22:44,405 --> 00:22:46,824
-I respect him.
-He likes you.

189
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,118
-Convince him to bend the knee…
-Your Grace.

190
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,161
…or he burns.

191
00:22:54,457 --> 00:22:57,001
-How much time do I have?
-Nightfall.

192
00:22:57,668 --> 00:23:01,213
The sun drops fast this time of year.
Hurry, Jon Snow.

193
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:06,052
Shield up.

194
00:23:07,345 --> 00:23:10,681
Attack, my lord! Attack!

195
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:13,142
Don't cross your feet.

196
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,646
My sons had swords in their hands
from the time they could walk. This one...

197
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:21,317
-Lord Arryn will never be a great warrior.
-Great warrior?

198
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:25,446
-He swings a sword like a girl with palsy.
-My lord.

199
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:29,283
Sword up, my lord!

200
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:38,751
Some boys develop more slowly.

201
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:44,173
-He's still young.
-He's 13. Boys go to war at 13.

202
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,050
-He has other gifts.
-Does he?

203
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:52,473
The gift of a great name.
Sometimes that's all one needs.

204
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,439
Goodbye, Lord Royce, and thank you
for all you've done for me.

205
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:02,983
I have done nothing more
than my duty, my lady.

206
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:04,860
I have no doubt that on my return,

207
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:06,904
Robin's skills will have
improved immeasurably.

208
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:14,036
He'll be safe here. As for his skills,
I make no promises.

209
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,135
Will we head north at some point?

210
00:24:30,845 --> 00:24:33,222
You said Sansa had a brother
at Castle Black.

211
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:36,183
We're a few days' ride from the Kingsroad.

212
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:38,769
-But that will take us--
-Us?

213
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:43,274
The only reason you're here
is because Jaime Lannister

214
00:24:43,357 --> 00:24:45,234
told me you weren't safe in the capital.

215
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:49,405
You're hundreds of miles
from King's Landing.

216
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:54,994
No one knows what you look like.
No one cares. You're safe.

217
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:57,746
-But I'm your squire.
-Do you even know what a squire is?

218
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,418
-An attendant to a knight.
-I'm not a knight.

219
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:04,545
That means you're not a squire.

220
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:08,591
-Well, where would I go?
-I don't care. I'm not your mother.

221
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:19,977
You swore to find the Stark girls.

222
00:25:20,311 --> 00:25:22,938
I found Arya.
She didn't want my protection.

223
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:25,065
-Sansa still might.
-Will you shut your mouth?

224
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:27,693
I didn't ask for your advice.

225
00:25:30,613 --> 00:25:33,908
I don't want anyone following me.
I'm not a leader.

226
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,369
All I ever wanted was to fight
for a lord I believed in.

227
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:40,414
The good lords are dead
and the rest are monsters.

228
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:53,886
You told Lord Royce
we were going to the Fingers.

229
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:54,887
I did.

230
00:25:56,222 --> 00:25:59,099
-But we're heading west.
-We are.

231
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:01,518
If he wanted to betray us,
he already would have.

232
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,898
Lord Royce might be as honorable
as he thinks he is,

233
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:08,108
but he's not alone in that castle.

234
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:12,863
Do you trust all those knights and ladies,
stable boys and serving girls?

235
00:26:12,947 --> 00:26:16,116
No. Do you trust the carriage driver
or the knights escorting us?

236
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,117
No.

237
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:20,162
But I pay them well,

238
00:26:20,246 --> 00:26:22,498
and they've seen what happens to men
who disappoint me.

239
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:26,710
So where are we going?
To a land where you trust everyone?

240
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:29,797
To a land so far from here,

241
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,549
even Cersei Lannister
can't get her hands on you.

242
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:43,894
It was such a deep, deep shock to us all.

243
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,649
Your father was a…

244
00:26:49,483 --> 00:26:52,611
a force to be reckoned with. He truly was.

245
00:26:53,988 --> 00:26:57,241
I wouldn't presume to… to claim
to have known him as such, but…

246
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,120
but just being in his presence
was enough to make it so clear

247
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:04,540
just how formidable a person
you were dealing with.

248
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,127
What a… what a force
to be reckoned with.

249
00:27:10,004 --> 00:27:12,047
Thank you so much for your kind words.

250
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:19,346
Deepest condolences, Your Grace.

251
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:23,517
This tragedy… I never trusted Varys.
I often warned…

252
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:29,773
Your Grace.

253
00:27:32,526 --> 00:27:35,863
-Cousin Lancel. I hardly recognized you.
-My deepest sympathies.

254
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:41,618
-I apologize for my son's appearance.
-Uncle, it's quite all right.

255
00:27:44,538 --> 00:27:48,709
They call themselves "Sparrows."
Bloody fanatics.

256
00:27:49,293 --> 00:27:52,629
Religion has its place, of course,
but at a certain point…

257
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:56,800
They never would have come
to the capital when Tywin was alive.

258
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:59,845
I'm sure he'll grow out of it,
whatever it is.

259
00:28:01,305 --> 00:28:02,848
-Excuse me.
-Of course.

260
00:28:21,784 --> 00:28:24,244
Your wounds from the Blackwater
seem to have healed.

261
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:27,581
It wasn't my wounds that needed healing.

262
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:31,710
What can I do for you?

263
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:34,880
You can forgive me.

264
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:38,467
What could you possibly have done
to warrant my forgiveness?

265
00:28:39,093 --> 00:28:43,055
-I led you into the darkness.
-I doubt you've ever led anyone anywhere.

266
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:45,599
I tempted you into our...

267
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,394
unnatural relations.

268
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:53,315
And, of course, there was the king…

269
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:56,610
his boar hunt.

270
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:00,406
His wine.

271
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:05,577
I don't know what you're talking about.

272
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:08,831
I'm a different person now.

273
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:15,212
I've found peace in the light
of the Seven. You can too.

274
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:18,507
They watch over all of us,
ready to dole out mercy…

275
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:20,968
or justice.

276
00:29:24,805 --> 00:29:26,432
Their world is at hand.

277
00:29:29,643 --> 00:29:31,061
I will pray for your father's soul.

278
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:36,817
The day Tywin Lannister's soul
needs your help…

279
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:48,537
-It looks like Dorne.
-It doesn't.

280
00:29:49,705 --> 00:29:50,622
It does.

281
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:55,502
That's the… that's the Sunspear
bit right there.

282
00:29:56,670 --> 00:30:00,674
And that's where the mountains are.
And over here is…

283
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:04,386
is Sunsnake?

284
00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:07,014
-Stonespear?
-Sandstone.

285
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:11,101
Yes. Yes, Sandstone.

286
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:15,731
-Just there.
-Fine.

287
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:20,444
It's Dorne.

288
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:23,238
We should go there.

289
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:27,576
-I think we would have a lovely time…
-Hmm.

290
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,870
…judging by my experience.

291
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:32,956
That would be wonderful.
Dorne, Highgarden.

292
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:35,292
Anywhere but here.

293
00:30:44,885 --> 00:30:46,470
We're late for dinner as it is.

294
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:50,140
-You're very respectful.
-I'm very hungry.

295
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:08,825
What's your name?

296
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:13,580
-Olyvar, my lady.
-I'm afraid my brother

297
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:17,000
is keeping the king waiting, Olyvar.

298
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:27,511
My lady.

299
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:44,695
Perhaps you might consider being
a bit more discreet?

300
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:48,407
Why? They all know about me anyway.

301
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:51,702
Everybody knows everything
about everyone.

302
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:54,538
What's the point in trying to keep
a secret in a place like this?

303
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:57,958
In any event, you shouldn't
keep your intended waiting.

304
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:02,337
My intended? Please. Tywin's dead.

305
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:05,132
That means no one can force Cersei
to marry me.

306
00:32:05,215 --> 00:32:06,925
-Lucky you.
-Unlucky you.

307
00:32:07,009 --> 00:32:09,386
You think I want that woman married
to my brother?

308
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:12,556
If she doesn't marry me,
she doesn't go to Highgarden.

309
00:32:13,015 --> 00:32:14,891
Which means she stays in King's Landing.

310
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:17,894
Which means you're trapped here
with Cersei Lannister

311
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:20,355
-as your mother by law.
-Perhaps.

312
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:25,068
-Perhaps?
-Perhaps.

313
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:43,170
Eunuch, the Spider,
the Master of Whisperers.

314
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:45,422
Imp, Half-man.

315
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:51,303
-There are faster ways to kill yourself.
-Not for a coward.

316
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:55,182
You are many things, my friend,
but not a coward.

317
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:03,732
-You never told me why you set me free.
-Your brother asked me to.

318
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,360
You could have said no.

319
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:09,446
Refuse the Kingslayer?
A dangerous proposition.

320
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:11,448
Not as dangerous as releasing me.

321
00:33:12,032 --> 00:33:14,451
You risked your life,
your position, everything.

322
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:16,828
Why? You're not family.
You owe me nothing.

323
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:21,792
I didn't do it for you.
I did it for the Seven Kingdoms.

324
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:25,128
A drunken dwarf will never be
the savior of the Seven Kingdoms.

325
00:33:25,212 --> 00:33:26,922
I don't believe in saviors.

326
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:30,801
I believe men of talent have a part
to play in the war to come.

327
00:33:32,386 --> 00:33:34,221
You're going to have
to find another soldier.

328
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,100
I'm done with Westeros
and Westeros is done with me.

329
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:42,771
You have many admirable qualities,
self-pity is not one of them.

330
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:47,734
Any fool with a bit of luck
can find himself born into power.

331
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:52,280
But earning it for yourself,
that takes work.

332
00:33:53,115 --> 00:33:55,492
-I'm not well-suited for work.
-I think you are.

333
00:33:56,076 --> 00:33:58,578
You have your father's instincts
for politics.

334
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:01,248
-And you have compassion.
-Compassion?

335
00:34:01,331 --> 00:34:02,332
Yes.

336
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:09,715
I killed my lover with my bare hands.
I shot my own father with a crossbow.

337
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,466
I never said you were perfect.

338
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:16,555
-What is it you want exactly?
-Peace.

339
00:34:18,098 --> 00:34:19,224
Prosperity.

340
00:34:20,142 --> 00:34:23,186
A land where the powerful
do not prey on the powerless.

341
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:25,522
Where the castles
are made of gingerbread

342
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:28,066
and the moats are filled
with blackberry wine.

343
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:30,610
The powerful have always preyed
on the powerless.

344
00:34:30,694 --> 00:34:32,988
That's how they became powerful
in the first place.

345
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:33,989
Perhaps.

346
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:37,993
And perhaps we've grown
so used to horror,

347
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:40,120
we assume there's no other way.

348
00:34:41,747 --> 00:34:43,749
If you sat on the Iron Throne,

349
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:45,959
would you spread misery
throughout the land?

350
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:50,005
-I will never sit on the Iron Throne.
-No, you won't.

351
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:54,843
But you could help another
climb those steps and take that seat.

352
00:34:56,136 --> 00:34:58,930
The Seven Kingdoms need
someone stronger than Tommen,

353
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:00,640
but gentler than Stannis.

354
00:35:01,391 --> 00:35:04,644
A monarch who can intimidate
the high lords and inspire the people.

355
00:35:05,145 --> 00:35:07,981
A ruler loved by millions
with a powerful army

356
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:11,651
-and the right family name.
-Good luck finding him.

357
00:35:13,195 --> 00:35:14,905
Who said anything about "him"?

358
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:23,914
You have a choice, my friend.
You can stay here at Illyrio's palace

359
00:35:23,997 --> 00:35:25,457
and drink yourself to death,

360
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:29,920
or you can ride with me to Meereen,
meet Daenerys Targaryen,

361
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:32,339
and decide if the world
is worth fighting for.

362
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:38,428
Can I drink myself to death
on the road to Meereen?

363
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:51,942
When did the Unsullied start patrolling
the streets of Meereen?

364
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:54,778
Looks like your friends haven't been
behaving themselves.

365
00:35:57,906 --> 00:36:01,034
Our mission to Yunkai
was a resounding success.

366
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:03,537
The Wise Masters of Yunkai
have agreed to cede power

367
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:07,874
to a council of elders made up of both
the freed men and the former slaveholders.

368
00:36:07,958 --> 00:36:10,627
All matters of consequence will be brought
to you for review.

369
00:36:11,253 --> 00:36:14,339
-Good.
-They did ask for some concessions.

370
00:36:15,549 --> 00:36:16,550
Concessions?

371
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,261
Politics is the art of compromise,
Your Grace.

372
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:25,308
-I'm not a politician. I'm a queen.
-Forgive me. You're right, of course.

373
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:29,729
Still, it's easier to rule happy subjects
than angry ones.

374
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:31,940
I don't expect the Wise Masters
to be happy.

375
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:35,068
Slavery made them rich. I ended slavery.

376
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:37,195
They do not ask for the return of slavery.

377
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:40,615
They ask for the reopening
of the fighting pits.

378
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:45,579
The fighting pits?
Where slaves fought slaves to the death?

379
00:36:45,996 --> 00:36:47,956
In the new world
that you've brought to us,

380
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,833
free men would fight free men.

381
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:54,588
The pit fighters you liberated
plead for this opportunity.

382
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:58,884
-Bring some here and ask them yourself.
-No fighting pits.

383
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:01,469
Opening them would show
the people of Yunkai and Meereen

384
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:02,971
that you respect their traditions.

385
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:06,057
I do not respect the tradition
of human cockfighting.

386
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:07,934
-If you--
-How many times must I say no

387
00:37:08,018 --> 00:37:09,102
before you understand?

388
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,773
Whatever he wants from me,
he's not going to get it.

389
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:16,943
If he really believes I'm going
to reopen the fighting pits…

390
00:37:17,027 --> 00:37:18,570
You should reopen the fighting pits.

391
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:24,367
-What?
-My mother was a whore. I told you that.

392
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:28,496
She liked to drink pear brandy.

393
00:37:29,331 --> 00:37:32,375
The older she got, the less she made
selling her body,

394
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:33,501
the more she wanted to drink.

395
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:38,131
So one day when I was 12,
she sold me to a slaver

396
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:39,466
she fucked the night before.

397
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:45,722
-I'm sorry.
-Why? I was a bad child.

398
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:50,977
I wasn't big, but I was quick.
And I loved to fight.

399
00:37:51,061 --> 00:37:54,397
So they sold me to a man in Tolos
who trained fighters for the pits.

400
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:59,402
-I had my first match when I was 16.
-You were sold into slavery,

401
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:02,197
forced to fight to the death
for the amusement of the masters,

402
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,657
and you're defending the fighting pits?

403
00:38:05,367 --> 00:38:07,869
I'm only here because of those pits.

404
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:10,872
I learned to fight
like a Dothraki screamer,

405
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:14,876
a Norvoshi priest, a Westerosi knight.
Soon I was famous.

406
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,212
Ten thousand men and women
screamed my name

407
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:20,590
when I stepped into the pit.
I made so much money for my master,

408
00:38:21,091 --> 00:38:22,550
he set me free when he died.

409
00:38:23,343 --> 00:38:26,596
I joined the Second Sons.
And then, I met you.

410
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:34,270
You're the queen.

411
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,315
Everyone's too afraid of you
to speak truth.

412
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:39,234
Everyone but me.

413
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:44,239
You've made thousands of enemies
all across the world.

414
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:48,034
As soon as they see weakness,
they'll attack.

415
00:38:49,411 --> 00:38:52,872
Show your strength here, now.

416
00:38:52,956 --> 00:38:55,166
That's why I have the Unsullied
patrolling the streets.

417
00:38:57,794 --> 00:39:00,797
Anyone with a chest full of gold
can buy an army of Unsullied.

418
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:03,508
You're not the Mother of Unsullied.

419
00:39:04,968 --> 00:39:06,469
You're the Mother of Dragons.

420
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:16,604
I don't want another child's bones
dropped at my feet.

421
00:39:18,648 --> 00:39:20,191
No one's seen Drogon in weeks.

422
00:39:21,443 --> 00:39:23,278
For all I know, he's flown halfway
across the world.

423
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:30,076
I can't control them anymore.

424
00:39:32,662 --> 00:39:34,456
A dragon queen with no dragons…

425
00:39:36,249 --> 00:39:37,167
is not a queen.

426
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:44,734
Viserion?

427
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:49,072
Rhaegal?

428
00:41:01,751 --> 00:41:04,045
Easy. Easy. Easy.

429
00:41:45,086 --> 00:41:47,922
-So here we are.
-Here we are.

430
00:41:51,301 --> 00:41:53,344
When we first met, you were my prisoner.

431
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:57,348
And now, for our last meeting…

432
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:04,689
-This doesn't have to be our last meeting.
-No, but it will be.

433
00:42:07,609 --> 00:42:08,610
You know what Stannis wants?

434
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:11,446
He wants me to bend the knee.

435
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:14,449
And he wants the Free Folk
to fight for him.

436
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:18,828
I'll give him this much, he's bold.

437
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:22,040
-Shouldn't a king be bold?
-Oh, aye.

438
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:24,459
I respect him.

439
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:27,587
If he gets what he wants,

440
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:30,048
I expect he'll be a better ruler
than the fools

441
00:42:30,131 --> 00:42:32,258
sitting on the Iron Throne
the last 2000 years.

442
00:42:33,176 --> 00:42:34,802
But I'll never serve him.

443
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:40,099
You told me you weren't here to conquer.
You told me your people have bled enough.

444
00:42:40,183 --> 00:42:41,100
That's right.

445
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:44,812
I don't want them bleeding
for Stannis Baratheon either.

446
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:48,274
You spent your life convincing 90 clans
to come together

447
00:42:48,358 --> 00:42:51,945
for the first time in history.
Thenns and Hornfoots,

448
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:54,739
the Ice-river clans, even the giants.

449
00:42:55,865 --> 00:42:58,785
A life's work uniting them.
You didn't do it for power.

450
00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:00,954
You didn't do it for glory.

451
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:04,249
You brought them together to save them

452
00:43:04,332 --> 00:43:05,917
because none of them
will survive the winter,

453
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,502
not if they're north of the Wall.

454
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:10,004
Isn't their survival more important
than your pride?

455
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:11,256
Pride?

456
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:15,551
Fuck my pride.

457
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:19,889
This isn't about that.

458
00:43:22,475 --> 00:43:25,687
Then bend the knee and save your people.

459
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:30,650
They followed me
because they respected me.

460
00:43:31,234 --> 00:43:32,568
Because they believed in me.

461
00:43:32,986 --> 00:43:35,405
The moment I kneel
for a southern king, that's all gone.

462
00:43:35,488 --> 00:43:37,699
And how many tens of thousands
are out there right now?

463
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:41,160
How many women? How many children?

464
00:43:41,911 --> 00:43:43,997
And you won't go out and rescue them
because why?

465
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:49,794
-You're afraid of looking afraid.
-I am afraid.

466
00:43:51,671 --> 00:43:52,755
No shame in that.

467
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:04,976
How will they do it? Beheading?

468
00:44:06,686 --> 00:44:07,604
Hanging?

469
00:44:11,941 --> 00:44:13,067
They'll burn you alive.

470
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:19,449
Bad way to go.

471
00:44:23,995 --> 00:44:27,206
I'll be honest with you.
I don't want to die.

472
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:29,083
And burnt to death,

473
00:44:29,751 --> 00:44:31,878
I don't want people
to remember me like that,

474
00:44:31,961 --> 00:44:33,671
scorched and screaming.

475
00:44:35,048 --> 00:44:37,717
But it's better than betraying everything
I believe.

476
00:44:38,968 --> 00:44:40,345
And what happens to your people?

477
00:44:41,346 --> 00:44:46,100
You preserve your dignity and die standing
and they'll sing songs about you.

478
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:50,438
You'd rather burn than kneel.
The great hero.

479
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:55,735
Until winter comes and the White Walkers
come for us all

480
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:57,528
and there's no one left to sing.

481
00:45:01,282 --> 00:45:05,119
You're a good lad. Truly, you are.

482
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:10,583
But if you can't understand
why I won't enlist my people

483
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:12,085
in a foreigner's war,

484
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,129
there's no point explaining.

485
00:45:31,938 --> 00:45:33,773
I think you're making a terrible mistake.

486
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:39,570
The freedom to make my own mistakes
was all I ever wanted.

487
00:46:49,724 --> 00:46:52,685
Mance Rayder, you've been called
the King-Beyond-the-Wall.

488
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:54,854
Westeros only has one king.

489
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:58,065
Bend the knee, I promise you mercy.

490
00:47:12,205 --> 00:47:13,164
Kneel and live.

491
00:47:21,714 --> 00:47:24,717
This was my home for many years.

492
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:30,848
I wish you good fortune in the wars
to come.

493
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:15,101
We all must choose.

494
00:48:16,686 --> 00:48:22,984
Man or woman, young or old,
lord or peasant, our choices are the same.

495
00:48:23,526 --> 00:48:29,824
We choose light or we choose darkness.
We choose good or we choose evil.

496
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:34,745
We choose the true god or the false.

497
00:48:46,007 --> 00:48:46,966
Free Folk,

498
00:48:48,301 --> 00:48:52,847
there is only one true king
and his name is Stannis.

499
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,099
Here stands your king of lies.

500
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:58,311
Behold the fate of those
who choose the darkness.
