You may give it to me.

507
01:07:36,009 --> 01:07:40,222
- You know what? I should do it myself.
- Captain.

508
01:07:40,764 --> 01:07:43,892
Sir, I insist you give me the plant.

509
01:07:44,059 --> 01:07:47,479
- Auto, get out of my way.
- We cannot go home.

510
01:07:47,646 --> 01:07:51,692
- What are you talking about? Why not?
- That is classified, captain.

511
01:07:51,858 --> 01:07:53,986
- Give me the plant.
- What do you mean, "classified"?

512
01:07:54,152 --> 01:07:56,572
- Don't keep a secret from the captain.
- Give me the plant.

513
01:07:56,738 --> 01:07:59,032
- Tell me what's classified.
- The plant.

514
01:07:59,199 --> 01:08:01,285
Tell me, Auto! That's an order.

515
01:08:04,663 --> 01:08:06,915
Aye, aye, Sir.

01:08:34,318 --> 01:08:36,403

No. Wait a minute.

540
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:21,156
Computer, when was that message
sent out to the <i>Axiom?

541
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:23,158
Message received
in the year 2110.

01:09:23,325 --> 01:09:26,828
That's... That's nearly 700 years ago!

543
01:09:27,037 --> 01:09:29,790
Auto, things have changed!
We've got to go back.

544
01:09:29,956 --> 01:09:32,834
Sir, orders are "do not return to Earth."

545
01:09:33,001 --> 01:09:37,631
But life is sustainable now.
Look at this plant. Green and growing.

546
01:09:37,798 --> 01:09:41,385
- It's living proof he was wrong.
- Irrelevant, captain.

547
01:09:41,551 --> 01:09:45,347
What? It's completely relevant!
Out there is our home.

548
01:09:45,514 --> 01:09:46,723
Home, Auto.

549
01:09:46,890 --> 01:09:50,352
And it's in trouble.
I can't just sit here and do nothing.

550
01:09:50,519 --> 01:09:52,104
That's all I've ever done.

551
01:09:52,270 --> 01:09:55,440
That's all anyone on this blasted ship
has ever done. Nothing!

552
01:09:55,607 --> 01:09:58,026
On the <i>Axiom</i> you will survive.

553
01:09:58,193 --> 01:10:02,739
- I don't want to survive. I want to live!
- Must follow my directive.

554

I'm the captain of the <i>Axiom.</i>

672
01:23:54,946 --> 01:23:56,322
WALL-E.

673
01:23:56,489 --> 01:23:58,574
<i>Course set for Earth.

674
01:23:58,741 --> 01:24:01,619
<i>Ten seconds to hyper-jump. Nine,</i>

675
01:24:01,786 --> 01:24:03,412
- No.
- <i>eight,

676
01:24:03,579 --> 01:24:07,250
- WALL-E!
- <i>seven, six, five, four,

677
01:24:07,416 --> 01:24:08,751
Oh, no. WALL-E.

678
01:24:08,918 --> 01:24:12,797
<i>three, two, one, zero.

679
01:24:21,097 --> 01:24:22,515
WALL-E!

680
01:25:48,476 --> 01:25:50,019
WALL-E.

681
01:25:51,729 --> 01:25:53,230
EVE!

682
01:26:33,938 --> 01:26:35,272
Huh?

683
01:26:59,338 --> 01:27:00,631
WALL-E.

684
01:27:09,765 --> 01:27:11,517
EVE.

685
01:27:14,854 --> 01:27:16,272
Ooh!

686
01:27:21,485 --> 01:27:22,987
WALL-E?

687
01:27:28,075 --> 01:27:29,368
Ooh!

688
01:27:31,495 --> 01:27:36,417
<i>Put on your Sunday clothes
When you feel down and out</i>

689
01:27:38,794 --> 01:27:40,504
WALL-E?

690
01:28:03,194 --> 01:28:05,070
WALL-E.

691
01:28:05,237 --> 01:28:07,156
WALL-E!

692
01:29:18,310 --> 01:29:21,689
- EVE?
- WALL-E?

693
01:29:25,192 --> 01:29:26,777
EVE!

694
01:29:28,946 --> 01:29:33,951
<i>And that is all

695
01:29:34,118 --> 01:29:38,831
<i>That love's about

696
01:29:40,207 --> 01:29:42,918
- Whee!
- You're kidding!

697
01:29:43,085 --> 01:29:44,879
Go, go, go.

698
01:29:45,337 --> 01:29:49,091
<i>And we'll recall
When time runs out</i>

699
01:29:49,258 --> 01:29:51,135
This is called farming!

700
01:29:51,302 --> 01:29:53,804
You kids are going to grow
all kinds of plants.

701
01:29:53,971 --> 01:29:56,181
Vegetable plants. Pizza plants!

702
01:29:57,558 --> 01:29:59,393
It's good to be home!

703
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:05,566
<i>Took a moment

704
01:30:06,317 --> 01:30:11,071
<i>To be loved

705
01:30:11,405 --> 01:30:16,952
<i>A whole life

706
01:30:17,870 --> 01:30:24,043
<i>Long

707
01:30:56,659 --> 01:31:00,955
<i>Did you think that your feet
Had been bound

708
01:31:02,498 --> 01:31:07,127
<i>By what gravity brings
To the ground?

709
01:31:09,046 --> 01:31:14,385
<i>Did you feel you were tricked
By the future you picked?

710
01:31:14,635 --> 01:31:16,512
<i>Well, come on down

711
01:31:21,016 --> 01:31:26,772
<i>All these rules don't apply
When you're high in the sky

712
01:31:26,939 --> 01:31:28,774
<i>So come on down

713
01:31:30,150 --> 01:31:31,777
<i>Come on down

714
01:31:32,653 --> 01:31:35,948
<i>We're coming down to the ground

715
01:31:36,281 --> 01:31:39,159
<i>There's no better place to go

716
01:31:39,326 --> 01:31:42,329
<i>We got snow up on the mountains

717
01:31:42,496 --> 01:31:44,748
<i>We got rivers down below

718
01:31:44,957 --> 01:31:48,127
<i>We're coming down to the ground

719
01:31:48,335 --> 01:31:51,380
<i>We hear the birds sing in the trees

720
01:31:51,547 --> 01:31:54,258
<i>And the land will be looked after

721
01:31:54,425 --> 01:31:57,261
<i>We'll send the seeds
Out in the breeze

722
01:32:05,227 --> 01:32:09,481
<i>Did you think
You'd escaped from routine

723
01:32:11,525 --> 01:32:15,612
<i>By changing the script
And the scene?

724
01:32:17,781 --> 01:32:20,367
<i>Despite all you made of it

725
01:32:20,784 --> 01:32:25,039
<i>You're always afraid
Of the change

726
01:32:29,460 --> 01:32:32,379
<i>You've got a lot on your chest

727
01:32:32,546 --> 01:32:35,299
<i>Well, you can come as my guest

728
01:32:35,466 --> 01:32:37,176
<i>So come on down

729
01:32:38,844 --> 01:32:40,596
<i>Come on down

730
01:32:41,305 --> 01:32:44,516
<i>We're coming down to the ground

731
01:32:44,683 --> 01:32:47,770
<i>There's no better place to go

732
01:32:47,936 --> 01:32:50,939
<i>We got snow up on the mountains

733
01:32:51,106 --> 01:32:53,567

<i>We'll send the seeds
Out in the breeze

738
01:33:10,375 --> 01:33:13,087
<i>Like the fish in the ocean

739
01:33:14,296 --> 01:33:16,507
<i>We felt at home in the sea

740
01:33:18,300 --> 01:33:21,011
<i>We learned to live off the good land

741
01:33:22,346 --> 01:33:24,640
<i>We learned to climb up a tree

742
01:33:26,433 --> 01:33:29,019
<i>Then we got up on two legs

743
01:33:30,687 --> 01:33:33,273
<i>But we wanted to fly

744
01:33:34,608 --> 01:33:37,319
<i>And when we messed up
Our homeland

745
01:33:38,654 --> 01:33:41,281
<i>We set sail for the sky

746
01:33:41,907 --> 01:33:44,993
<i>We're coming down to the ground

747
01:33:45,410 --> 01:33:48,205
<i>There's no better place to go

748
01:33:48,372 --> 01:33:51,458
<i>We got snow up on the mountains

749

<i>We got rivers down below

750
01:33:54,128 --> 01:33:57,297
<i>We're coming down to the ground

751
01:33:57,464 --> 01:34:00,551

752
01:34:00,717 --> 01:34:03,512
<i>And the land will be looked after

753

<i>We'll send the seeds
Out in the breeze

754
01:34:06,265 --> 01:34:08,183
<i>We're coming down

755
01:34:09,351 --> 01:34:11,395
<i>Coming down to Earth

756
01:34:12,437 --> 01:34:14,690
<i>Like babies at birth

757
01:34:15,482 --> 01:34:17,442
<i>Coming down to Earth

758
01:34:18,485 --> 01:34:20,988
<i>We define new priorities

759
01:34:21,363 --> 01:34:24,366
<i>These are extraordinary qualities

760
01:34:30,664 --> 01:34:33,667

779
01:35:49,993 --> 01:35:51,745

780
01:36:02,256 --> 01:36:03,882
