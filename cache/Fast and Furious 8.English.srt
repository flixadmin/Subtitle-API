1
00:01:11,139 --> 00:01:16,039
HAVANA, CUBA

2
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:19,297
<i>We swap in parts from Ford
Plymouths and Cadillac.

3
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,121
<i>My grandfather bought it in 1957.

4
00:02:22,122 --> 00:02:25,719
<i>When he died it passed to my father.
Then my brother and now to me.

5
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,972
<i>Look at this,
this is an engine from a boat.

6
00:02:28,973 --> 00:02:30,165
<i>- No way.
- Yeah!

7
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:32,426
<i>Whatever it takes to keep it running!

8
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:34,423
This is a cuban spirit.

9
00:02:34,424 --> 00:02:37,389
<i>Your spirit, keep it up.
Never ever lose that.

10
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,324
<i>Dom..

11
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:41,321
<i>It's your cousin..
He's in trouble, come quickly!

12
00:02:41,346 --> 00:02:43,429
<i>Come on, come on.

13
00:02:51,962 --> 00:02:55,278
<i>Please don't do this,
Understand my problem.

14
00:02:55,279 --> 00:02:56,389
You know I can't make
living without my car.

15
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,748
Isn't my problem bro.

16
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,003
Dominic Toretto..
I heard about you.

17
00:03:01,503 --> 00:03:02,641
Welcome to my island.

18
00:03:02,642 --> 00:03:04,754
Why he hooking up
my cousin's car?

19
00:03:04,755 --> 00:03:09,182
In the morning, I gave it to him..
He can't pay.. I take the car.

20
00:03:09,183 --> 00:03:10,386
I just need a few more days.

21
00:03:10,387 --> 00:03:12,279
Few more days isn't
part of the deal.

22
00:03:12,455 --> 00:03:13,760
Come on..

23
00:03:13,844 --> 00:03:15,884
You make a deal
you gotta live up to it.

24
00:03:15,885 --> 00:03:19,004
You make a deal
You gonna live up to it.

25
00:03:19,374 --> 00:03:21,044
Gonna live up to it?

26
00:03:23,528 --> 00:03:25,079
So you are one of those types..

27
00:03:25,175 --> 00:03:28,628
You take everyone's ride and then
ship it back to the states.

28
00:03:28,629 --> 00:03:31,050
<i>You should show your
people some respect.

29
00:03:31,051 --> 00:03:32,882
You watch your mouth.

30
00:03:34,492 --> 00:03:36,103
Now you got a problem.

31
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,508
I'm gonna keep it about the cars.

32
00:03:40,509 --> 00:03:42,773
<i>I am really scared.

33
00:03:43,313 --> 00:03:45,424
You want a car?
Get it the right way.

34
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:48,319
- How?
- Race war.

35
00:03:48,935 --> 00:03:51,213
I already own it, bro.

36
00:03:51,859 --> 00:03:53,520
Not that car.

37
00:03:54,842 --> 00:03:56,160
Mine.

38
00:03:56,954 --> 00:04:00,348
Dom, his car is the
fastest car in the Island.

39
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:01,982
Do you know what he
has under the hood?

40
00:04:01,983 --> 00:04:04,425
Do you know, it doesn't matter
what's under a hood?

41
00:04:05,001 --> 00:04:08,519
The only thing that matters is
who's behind the wheel.

42
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,069
- You think so?
- I know so.

43
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:13,352
Then race his car.

44
00:04:15,059 --> 00:04:17,976
We ain't racing a quarter mile here.

45
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:20,004
We race the cuban mile.

46
00:04:20,792 --> 00:04:22,400
Done!

47
00:04:36,955 --> 00:04:38,900
I appreciate you what
you're trying to do.

48
00:04:39,434 --> 00:04:42,208
My car is the slowest
car on the Island.

49
00:04:44,562 --> 00:04:46,271
Was...!

50
00:04:46,272 --> 00:04:49,154
Pull the seats the doors
the battery..

51
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:51,563
It ain't the motor, take it off.

52
00:04:53,078 --> 00:04:56,262
- Laughing gas?
- Nah, Fed. This is cuban NOS.

53
00:04:56,263 --> 00:04:58,442
You guys are crazy.

54
00:05:00,004 --> 00:05:02,006
- What are you doing?
- Warm as turbo.

55
00:05:02,015 --> 00:05:04,633
Pull that back in line..
Hold on!

56
00:05:04,647 --> 00:05:06,760
Old trick used to play.

57
00:05:06,926 --> 00:05:08,432
In case of emergencies.

58
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,844
You know that's way too much
booze for that engine.

59
00:05:10,883 --> 00:05:14,536
- It's going to be fast.
- It's gonna be a bomb.

60
00:05:14,769 --> 00:05:16,673
Only needs to go a mile.

61
00:05:43,005 --> 00:05:45,458
<i>Are you ready for this, family?

62
00:05:45,459 --> 00:05:47,719
<i>This is Havana!

63
00:05:49,292 --> 00:05:50,725
<i>Be fast!

64
00:05:51,942 --> 00:05:53,247
<i>Be safe!

65
00:05:54,415 --> 00:05:57,877
<i>But don't be last.
Racers ready...?

66
00:05:58,004 --> 00:05:59,532
<i>Go...!

67
00:06:28,371 --> 00:06:29,676
<i>Stop.

68
00:06:37,179 --> 00:06:40,054
That car belongs in the trash bro.

69
00:07:29,122 --> 00:07:32,019
- Where are we going?
- I don't know. Let's go.

70
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:49,146
- Go steer.
- Si.

71
00:08:07,475 --> 00:08:09,340
Adios, Toretto.

72
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:17,024
Ok, buster...
Let's see if this works.

73
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:26,196
That's impossible..

74
00:09:45,197 --> 00:09:46,502
Look out.

75
00:10:40,927 --> 00:10:42,232
A deal's a deal.

76
00:10:44,045 --> 00:10:45,579
You own my car.

77
00:10:47,369 --> 00:10:49,490
And you earn my respect.

78
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:05,198
Keep your car.

79
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:08,229
Your respect is
good enough for me.

80
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:15,119
Yo Cousin.

81
00:11:16,047 --> 00:11:17,614
Sorry 'bout your car,

82
00:11:22,927 --> 00:11:25,590
Your's was too slow
for a Torreto anyway.

83
00:11:25,591 --> 00:11:28,497
Your Impala. Are you serious?

84
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:16,668
Look at that smile

85
00:12:17,058 --> 00:12:18,455
I love it when you smile.

86
00:12:18,892 --> 00:12:20,295
Make me happy.

87
00:12:21,446 --> 00:12:24,152
I think this place makes you happy.

88
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:27,531
It's like it speaks to you.

89
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:34,413
You remember that guy?
The Racer and his dad.

90
00:12:35,035 --> 00:12:37,333
- The one with the boat engine.
- Yeah!

91
00:12:37,648 --> 00:12:39,148
- Yeah.
- Of course.

92
00:12:39,149 --> 00:12:42,311
I was looking at them, and I..

93
00:12:42,775 --> 00:12:47,497
And I couldn't help but too imagine
what you'd be like, if you were dad.

94
00:12:49,127 --> 00:12:52,492
No, no, no... I'm not pregnant.

95
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:57,406
Is that what you want?

96
00:12:58,003 --> 00:13:00,170
It's not about what I want
or what you want..

97
00:13:01,137 --> 00:13:03,866
It's about why
we haven't asked the question.

98
00:13:27,727 --> 00:13:29,506
<i>Can I help you with that?

99
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,572
- What?
- You need a hand?

100
00:13:33,143 --> 00:13:35,439
Yeah, I think I do.

101
00:13:35,678 --> 00:13:37,507
Sounds like you're
not getting any fuel.

102
00:13:37,508 --> 00:13:38,813
Yeah.

103
00:13:40,151 --> 00:13:42,549
See if we can get
some power into it.

104
00:13:44,412 --> 00:13:46,425
What brings you to Cuba?

105
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:50,246
The same thing that brings
everyone else to Cuba.

106
00:13:51,042 --> 00:13:53,435
Culture. People. Beauty.

107
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:55,530
What brings you to Cuba?

108
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:58,570
- Work!
- Must be casual Friday.

109
00:13:59,974 --> 00:14:02,070
How is that honeymoon going Dom?

110
00:14:07,114 --> 00:14:09,387
Your fuel relay is missing.

111
00:14:11,085 --> 00:14:12,584
I know.

112
00:14:16,383 --> 00:14:20,122
I'd love to play games.
Beaten the bests alone.

113
00:14:20,895 --> 00:14:23,064
I'm kinda in a rush,
so if you got something to say...

114
00:14:23,065 --> 00:14:25,600
Oh this is a very different game
that I can assure you.

115
00:14:26,135 --> 00:14:27,592
This...?

116
00:14:28,135 --> 00:14:30,867
There is something much greater
at work here.

117
00:14:31,774 --> 00:14:33,509
This is fate.

118
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:36,541
- I choose to make my own fate.
- Not today.

119
00:14:37,014 --> 00:14:40,092
This is the road you take
to your apartment every morning.

120
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:43,552
What else is different, Dom?
The Santiago's closed?

121
00:14:43,553 --> 00:14:45,852
Did you have to cross two blocks
to go get your cuban coffee?

122
00:14:45,853 --> 00:14:48,152
So, what is it? Black, no sugar?

123
00:14:49,062 --> 00:14:53,297
Yeah.. I've put a lot of work
into getting you here in today.

124
00:14:53,298 --> 00:14:55,604
Now that I'm here,
what do you want?

125
00:14:55,942 --> 00:14:58,404
I want you to work for me.

126
00:14:58,904 --> 00:15:00,209
Work for you?

127
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:02,635
Well, I could have saved you
a lot of time then.

128
00:15:02,922 --> 00:15:04,767
See, I don't work for anyone.

129
00:15:05,111 --> 00:15:06,992
You can't walk away from this Dom.

130
00:15:06,993 --> 00:15:09,794
We're gonna have this
conversation one way or the other.

131
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,422
See that's the funny
thing about fate.

132
00:15:13,587 --> 00:15:14,892
It's cunning.

133
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:16,560
It can bring you beautiful things,

134
00:15:16,561 --> 00:15:18,877
and it can also bring you
moments like this.

135
00:15:32,642 --> 00:15:35,482
I will hear that you
want to work for me.

136
00:15:36,012 --> 00:15:37,913
You're gonna betray your brothers,

137
00:15:37,914 --> 00:15:40,116
abandon your code,
shatter your family.

138
00:15:40,117 --> 00:15:41,598
See, your team..

139
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:44,761
Is about to go up against the
only thing they can't handle.

140
00:15:46,137 --> 00:15:47,442
What's that?

141
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:50,042
You.

142
00:15:51,697 --> 00:15:55,338
Oh, and Dom,
I wouldn't mention this to anyone.

143
00:16:03,981 --> 00:16:06,543
They are gonna be hitting us
with everything they've got.

144
00:16:07,048 --> 00:16:09,247
So, we wanna engage
with maximum speed.

145
00:16:09,248 --> 00:16:12,496
Neutralize the shooters
and then move on to our objective.

146
00:16:12,691 --> 00:16:14,942
There are two things
I want you to keep in mind,

147
00:16:14,943 --> 00:16:16,057
Number one,

148
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,527
I choose you for this squad

149
00:16:17,528 --> 00:16:21,273
because you are the most
fearsome warriors on the planet.

150
00:16:21,274 --> 00:16:22,743
And number two,

151
00:16:22,793 --> 00:16:26,101
You go out there, you do your job.
And you take 'em down.

152
00:16:26,102 --> 00:16:28,790
Everyone...
And I mean everyone..

153
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:31,435
Manice and pedice at the mall.

154
00:16:31,507 --> 00:16:32,812
Later on today.

155
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,226
I don't wanna play anymore.

156
00:17:34,745 --> 00:17:36,757
Alright, let's go, girls.
Let's go, let's go.

157
00:17:36,758 --> 00:17:39,305
- Final 2 minutes.
- Quite the cheering section.

158
00:17:42,927 --> 00:17:46,226
Oh yeah. That's moms
they come out to sport the kids.

159
00:17:46,227 --> 00:17:48,329
Except there seems to be more moms
than kids,

160
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,625
Way more like moms and..

161
00:17:53,467 --> 00:17:56,499
Yeah, it's a big soccer job.
Let's go girls.

162
00:17:56,702 --> 00:17:58,472
So your intel was spot on...

163
00:17:58,762 --> 00:18:01,564
A democly 7 EMP weapon
that went missing in the gulf.

164
00:18:01,565 --> 00:18:04,277
Arms dealer from the
Liberation front have it in Berlin.

165
00:18:04,278 --> 00:18:05,758
- Shit.
- This thing can wipe out..

166
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:08,081
An entire electrical grid
in a major city.

167
00:18:08,082 --> 00:18:10,549
No lights, no power,
instant stone age.

168
00:18:11,052 --> 00:18:12,051
Chloe, Maya...

169
00:18:12,052 --> 00:18:13,220
You can't let her run
by you like that.

170
00:18:13,221 --> 00:18:14,731
- Let's go, let's go.
- Hey, Hobbs.

171
00:18:14,732 --> 00:18:16,495
This is a class 4 WMD.

172
00:18:16,496 --> 00:18:17,979
Do you have any idea what's
at stake here...?

173
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:20,328
Yes...! I know exactly what is
at stake here, okay?

174
00:18:20,329 --> 00:18:22,517
If Pink Butterflies
beat my Red Dragon

175
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,942
that means we lose the championship.

176
00:18:25,134 --> 00:18:27,613
Which means I have 20 little girls
who are crying..

177
00:18:27,614 --> 00:18:28,842
And that's not a good thing.

178
00:18:28,843 --> 00:18:31,595
Which then means I have to spend
a lot of time in ice cream shops

179
00:18:31,596 --> 00:18:33,663
and lot of time in Tay-Tay concerts.

180
00:18:34,177 --> 00:18:37,214
- Tay-Tay?
- Yep? Taylor Swift.

181
00:18:37,215 --> 00:18:39,367
You gotta be shitting me
Get it together.

182
00:18:39,454 --> 00:18:40,534
Let's go girls.

183
00:18:40,535 --> 00:18:41,840
We need you to do this,

184
00:18:41,886 --> 00:18:44,966
Lot of lives are at stake.
I need to be clear here.

185
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:48,116
US Government can not sanction
this operation in anyway.

186
00:18:48,117 --> 00:18:49,160
You're on your own.

187
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:51,807
This thing goes sideways
you don't just get burned,

188
00:18:51,926 --> 00:18:53,411
you go to prison.

189
00:18:53,706 --> 00:18:55,771
And there's nothing we can do
to get you out.

190
00:18:56,767 --> 00:18:58,270
Let me tell you something.

191
00:18:58,271 --> 00:19:01,545
The only thing that I love
more than saving lives..

192
00:19:01,989 --> 00:19:03,442
Is my daughter.

193
00:19:03,443 --> 00:19:06,246
So you don't shut up with this
government bullshit right now

194
00:19:06,247 --> 00:19:11,354
and start showing some team spirit
and respect for the Red Dragons.

195
00:19:11,853 --> 00:19:15,494
I'm gonna have all 20 of them lined
up kick you right in the Tay-Tay.

196
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,526
Go, Dragons!

197
00:19:20,463 --> 00:19:21,330
Say it again.

198
00:19:21,331 --> 00:19:23,991
- Go, Dragons!
- Good boy.

199
00:19:24,036 --> 00:19:26,460
Go Dragons.. Go Dragons..

200
00:19:27,073 --> 00:19:29,138
Go, he's open... Go, Yup!

201
00:19:29,139 --> 00:19:31,378
Yes!

202
00:19:31,842 --> 00:19:34,411
That is my daughter right there!
Yes!

203
00:19:34,678 --> 00:19:36,464
Ah, yes, come here.

204
00:19:37,248 --> 00:19:39,490
- Awesome.
- Nice job.

205
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:46,219
Daddy's gotta go to work?

206
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,589
Oh yeah,
daddy's gotta go to work.

207
00:19:49,127 --> 00:19:51,559
Now, you gonna need to get a team
that you can trust.

208
00:19:51,954 --> 00:19:53,899
Oh, I already got one.

209
00:20:15,155 --> 00:20:17,321
- Hey, Dom.
- Hey, Hobbs.

210
00:20:17,322 --> 00:20:19,889
We got a job in Berlin,
and I need a favor, brother.

211
00:20:21,496 --> 00:20:22,095
No problem.

212
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:24,031
I grab the team and
meet you in Berlin.

213
00:20:24,632 --> 00:20:26,862
Thanks man. I'll see you soon.

214
00:20:53,298 --> 00:20:55,806
You were only to supposed
to create a diversion, Roman.

215
00:20:55,807 --> 00:20:57,064
That was a diversion.

216
00:20:57,065 --> 00:20:59,167
How many of the damn explosives
did you use?

217
00:20:59,168 --> 00:21:01,424
I do not know, Tez. All of it?

218
00:21:01,425 --> 00:21:03,527
- Wait, all of it?
- Roman, Jesus!

219
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:06,567
- Christ!
- You have more of your fan club ahead.

220
00:21:12,246 --> 00:21:13,551
They're still on us.

221
00:21:14,212 --> 00:21:15,771
These guys are taking this personal.

222
00:21:15,772 --> 00:21:19,146
Roman, we just blown up their
facility and stole their EMP.

223
00:21:19,174 --> 00:21:20,725
Other than your doctor's cold fingers,

224
00:21:20,726 --> 00:21:23,275
I'd say it's about as
personal as it can get.

225
00:21:23,501 --> 00:21:25,404
- Phase 2.
- Phase 2?

226
00:21:25,405 --> 00:21:27,414
So you just gonna keep
that to yourself?

227
00:21:27,415 --> 00:21:28,808
What happen to Phase 1?

228
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:29,879
What about that part?

229
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,359
Yeah, remember the airplane?

230
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,374
Everyone drove their
cars out but you.

231
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,114
I told you my engine seized up.

232
00:21:35,115 --> 00:21:36,275
It's your balls that seized up?

233
00:21:36,276 --> 00:21:37,825
Just follow my lead, okay?

234
00:21:37,826 --> 00:21:41,593
And Roman, whatever you do.
Don't think.

235
00:21:42,087 --> 00:21:43,594
Tez, drop it.

236
00:21:43,789 --> 00:21:45,094
Bomb's away.

237
00:21:47,228 --> 00:21:48,533
Split now!

238
00:21:52,293 --> 00:21:53,769
Holy shit!

239
00:21:54,163 --> 00:21:55,637
<i>Look out...!

240
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:11,806
- Great plan Tez.
- Just so you know.

241
00:22:11,807 --> 00:22:13,140
You miss some.

242
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:15,517
I'll just wait for it.

243
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,193
Oh... Shit!

244
00:22:30,842 --> 00:22:32,639
I hate you, Tez!

245
00:22:34,638 --> 00:22:35,980
Got your ass.

246
00:22:41,878 --> 00:22:43,183
You good?

247
00:22:45,165 --> 00:22:47,437
I'll see you when it's done.

248
00:22:50,856 --> 00:22:52,004
Alright. Great job, team.

249
00:22:52,005 --> 00:22:54,209
Let's break up and meet
me at the safe house.

250
00:23:08,695 --> 00:23:10,258
Hell of a job, brother.

251
00:23:10,259 --> 00:23:12,365
When we can get back
to the base. Beers on me.

252
00:23:36,174 --> 00:23:38,349
You lost your god damn mind,
Toretto!

253
00:23:41,801 --> 00:23:43,264
Toretto you put hands on that thing,

254
00:23:43,265 --> 00:23:46,362
you're gonna have the whole world
coming for you including me.

255
00:23:51,026 --> 00:23:52,310
I don't know what you're doing

256
00:23:52,311 --> 00:23:54,217
but you better think
about this, Toretto.

257
00:23:55,178 --> 00:23:57,450
It ain't too late to stop this.

258
00:24:09,252 --> 00:24:10,557
It is now.

259
00:24:15,749 --> 00:24:18,076
That some bitch just crossed us..

260
00:24:18,077 --> 00:24:18,638
What?

261
00:24:18,639 --> 00:24:20,170
Wait a second, what
are you talking about?

262
00:24:20,171 --> 00:24:22,804
- Dom took the EMP.
- Bullshit.

263
00:24:23,813 --> 00:24:24,677
Where are you?

264
00:24:24,678 --> 00:24:26,389
It's too late for me.
Get out of here.

265
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:28,081
Saw that look in his eyes.

266
00:24:28,082 --> 00:24:30,634
I've seen that look before.

267
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:33,070
Dominic Toretto just went rogue.

268
00:25:34,823 --> 00:25:36,932
Alright, I got his phone records, y'all.

269
00:25:36,933 --> 00:25:39,479
It's a whole bunch of calls
to untraceable numbers.

270
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,707
Burner phone, right?

271
00:25:40,708 --> 00:25:41,979
Nah. Scrambled.

272
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:44,453
Same number but they got
some sort of micro-router..

273
00:25:44,454 --> 00:25:47,058
To bury the signal path
which means Dom is clearly..

274
00:25:47,059 --> 00:25:49,297
Communicating with somebody
that is above our pay grade.

275
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:51,467
Look,
I do not know Dom as well as you,

276
00:25:51,468 --> 00:25:53,598
but if we just look at the facts.

277
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:56,094
Dom's been having highly encrypted

278
00:25:56,095 --> 00:25:59,140
conversation with some
mysterious person.

279
00:25:59,665 --> 00:26:01,521
He took out Hobbs.

280
00:26:01,522 --> 00:26:04,311
He stole the EMP,
now he's disappeared.

281
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:05,499
So what're you saying?

282
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,716
Maybe we should
consider the fact that..

283
00:26:07,717 --> 00:26:09,022
Hobb's right.

284
00:26:09,163 --> 00:26:11,528
Dom did go rogue.

285
00:26:12,395 --> 00:26:14,794
- Letty.
- Before you judge the man,

286
00:26:14,989 --> 00:26:19,135
Remember you're breathing
now because he saved your life.

287
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:28,866
You just gonna let her
bump your shoulder like that

288
00:26:29,822 --> 00:26:33,035
I'm just saying it out..
That was a little aggressive.

289
00:26:34,825 --> 00:26:36,962
What're you gonna do. Email her?

290
00:26:39,558 --> 00:26:40,863
<i>Chick..

291
00:26:51,626 --> 00:26:53,057
No no, wait, fellas.

292
00:26:54,083 --> 00:26:55,443
Thank you.

293
00:26:55,586 --> 00:26:57,693
Well, this is an exciting new look.

294
00:26:57,694 --> 00:27:00,935
That's a little tight on
the crotch as always.

295
00:27:01,064 --> 00:27:03,461
What boyband bus did she fallen off?

296
00:27:03,567 --> 00:27:05,238
My new junior associate.

297
00:27:05,239 --> 00:27:07,197
He's working with me on this.
All yours.

298
00:27:07,198 --> 00:27:07,914
Mr Nobody and I

299
00:27:07,915 --> 00:27:10,182
have been given the authority
to get you out of this.

300
00:27:10,183 --> 00:27:13,617
All you have to do is agree
to the terms and you're free.

301
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,665
Restraining wills, talking about,
what terms?

302
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,892
Confess to your crimes in Berlin.

303
00:27:18,893 --> 00:27:20,787
Treason,
international espionage.

304
00:27:20,788 --> 00:27:22,873
Massive destruction
of civic property.

305
00:27:22,874 --> 00:27:24,955
You do that, we close the case.

306
00:27:24,956 --> 00:27:25,484
And?

307
00:27:25,485 --> 00:27:28,726
And the DSS blacklist.
Sure Germany loves that.

308
00:27:28,805 --> 00:27:30,566
Officially you'll be a criminal.

309
00:27:30,567 --> 00:27:31,337
Woah, woah, woah.

310
00:27:31,338 --> 00:27:33,265
You need to work on
your delivery alright.

311
00:27:33,266 --> 00:27:34,571
Unofficially.

312
00:27:36,083 --> 00:27:39,358
You're off the books.
Come work with me.

313
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,135
- I'm not a criminal.
- Luke Come on. Labels.

314
00:27:43,534 --> 00:27:45,389
There is no confession.

315
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:47,030
There are no back room deals.

316
00:27:47,031 --> 00:27:49,360
Got myself into this,
I'm gonna get myself out of it.

317
00:27:49,361 --> 00:27:50,115
You know that.

318
00:27:50,116 --> 00:27:52,047
I do and that's
what I told them.

319
00:27:52,048 --> 00:27:54,017
Well, there you have it.

320
00:27:54,921 --> 00:27:57,286
Good luck in the course, man!

321
00:27:58,753 --> 00:28:00,855
What about your daughter?

322
00:28:02,586 --> 00:28:04,811
You know, if you're not
gonna do it your country,

323
00:28:04,957 --> 00:28:06,667
at least do it for your kid.

324
00:28:06,804 --> 00:28:08,570
Big mistake kid.

325
00:28:10,265 --> 00:28:12,015
Hold on. Look, look.

326
00:28:12,016 --> 00:28:13,806
He's still working from the manual.

327
00:28:13,807 --> 00:28:16,326
I mean, he doesn't even
really know the rules.

328
00:28:16,721 --> 00:28:18,989
Oh come on. Give him a break.

329
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:20,295
Get a break.

330
00:28:20,466 --> 00:28:21,863
Luke?

331
00:28:24,503 --> 00:28:26,777
I appreciate that.

332
00:28:26,929 --> 00:28:30,068
- It's good to see you, Nobody.
- You too.

333
00:28:32,091 --> 00:28:33,423
Rule No.1,

334
00:28:35,033 --> 00:28:36,255
know your audience.

335
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:38,684
I gave you your shot,
you shit the bed.

336
00:28:38,691 --> 00:28:40,929
Now I'm gonna show you
how to get this done.

337
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,831
- You're dead cop!
- Dead!

338
00:28:55,288 --> 00:28:57,298
Well, well, well...

339
00:28:57,364 --> 00:29:00,977
Luke Hobbs behind bars.
Would you look at that?

340
00:29:01,993 --> 00:29:04,126
The band cop got it's day.

341
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,708
You know,
that color looks good on you.

342
00:29:18,709 --> 00:29:21,240
Yeah. Look a whole hell of a lot better
with your blood on it.

343
00:29:21,241 --> 00:29:23,550
Yeah. Good luck with that, Hercules.

344
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:25,695
Gone bad. Huh?

345
00:29:26,143 --> 00:29:27,608
Such a cliche.

346
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:30,368
Ah well. Welcome to the club.

347
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,590
I wouldn't get that twisted son.

348
00:29:32,591 --> 00:29:34,826
We ain't in no club.
We got nothing in common.

349
00:29:34,827 --> 00:29:36,890
And unlike you,
I ain't gonna be here long.

350
00:29:36,891 --> 00:29:38,222
You bring the shovel did you?

351
00:29:38,223 --> 00:29:41,196
Cause it's 38 feet of
steel and concrete.

352
00:29:41,197 --> 00:29:43,527
What's up big dog?

353
00:29:45,001 --> 00:29:46,306
Better get to dig in.

354
00:29:48,206 --> 00:29:49,520
You wanker.

355
00:30:10,587 --> 00:30:11,892
Move..

356
00:30:12,517 --> 00:30:13,822
Say that again.

357
00:30:14,613 --> 00:30:18,816
If I say it again,
It will be to acorpse.

358
00:30:21,562 --> 00:30:23,071
I'm going to enjoy this.

359
00:30:23,072 --> 00:30:24,768
Welcome back, Dom.

360
00:30:25,055 --> 00:30:26,459
Nice job out there.

361
00:30:27,857 --> 00:30:29,327
Excited about tonight?

362
00:30:30,723 --> 00:30:32,168
You're going on this?

363
00:30:36,837 --> 00:30:38,273
You're with me Dom.

364
00:30:48,145 --> 00:30:50,342
- Showing me your shoe collection?
- Yup.

365
00:30:54,348 --> 00:30:56,115
A pair for every occasion.

366
00:30:56,116 --> 00:30:59,247
There's enough guns here to
outfit a small army. Huh?

367
00:30:59,248 --> 00:31:01,822
Oh this is just the
tip of the iceberg.

368
00:31:04,922 --> 00:31:06,554
You know what I like about you, Dom.

369
00:31:06,555 --> 00:31:07,909
You're a genuine outlaw.

370
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:10,723
I mean, you're a man who
lives by his own rules.

371
00:31:10,724 --> 00:31:14,658
Which was surprising because when I
saw you in Cuba, I heard about a

372
00:31:14,659 --> 00:31:17,287
guy who almost killed
you with a motorcycle and

373
00:31:17,288 --> 00:31:19,732
you.. let him keep his car?

374
00:31:19,733 --> 00:31:23,927
- Oh, that confused you?
- Hmm.

375
00:31:24,568 --> 00:31:26,863
Of course I could've
taken his car.

376
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:29,472
But it's about something bigger.

377
00:31:29,473 --> 00:31:30,900
This way...

378
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:34,305
I changed them.

379
00:31:34,306 --> 00:31:35,768
That's not your responsibility.

380
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:37,469
- That's who I am.
- Is it?

381
00:31:37,976 --> 00:31:41,745
Let me ask you something Dom,
what's the best thing in your life?

382
00:31:42,413 --> 00:31:44,776
- Family.
- No, it's not.

383
00:31:46,181 --> 00:31:47,953
But if you're being honest?

384
00:31:48,483 --> 00:31:50,349
It's the 10 seconds between

385
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:53,484
start and finish, when you're not
thinking about anything.

386
00:31:53,485 --> 00:31:57,748
No family,
not obligations, just you.

387
00:31:58,489 --> 00:31:59,954
Being free.

388
00:32:04,773 --> 00:32:07,652
I gotta tell you.
This whole saving the world...

389
00:32:07,653 --> 00:32:10,532
Robin Hood nonsense
you've been doing recently...

390
00:32:10,533 --> 00:32:13,735
It's bullshit. It's not you.

391
00:32:18,502 --> 00:32:20,774
Be who you are.

392
00:32:20,869 --> 00:32:23,065
Why live only a quarter
mile at a time,

393
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:25,900
when you can live your
whole life that way?

394
00:32:38,409 --> 00:32:41,483
See all those blow that muscles
will give you.

395
00:32:41,484 --> 00:32:43,754
All show and no..

396
00:32:57,393 --> 00:32:58,956
Well I got plenty of goal.

397
00:32:58,957 --> 00:33:00,450
You must have misplaced that.

398
00:33:00,451 --> 00:33:03,093
When I kicked your ass up in
down that office of yours.

399
00:33:03,094 --> 00:33:04,760
Yeah.

400
00:33:05,631 --> 00:33:08,114
Just like you Brits,
rewriting History, huh?

401
00:33:08,115 --> 00:33:10,599
All I know. It was not
me who was thrown out

402
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,627
of a 4 storey window.

403
00:33:11,628 --> 00:33:14,768
Jumped.
I jumped out of a 4 storey window.

404
00:33:14,769 --> 00:33:16,469
Saving my partner's life.

405
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:17,686
Because where I'm from,

406
00:33:17,687 --> 00:33:19,831
we don't settle fight
by throwing bombs.

407
00:33:19,832 --> 00:33:21,681
Well, that's funny, because
where I'm from,

408
00:33:21,682 --> 00:33:24,275
we don't need women
to run to our rescue.

409
00:33:24,276 --> 00:33:27,739
I mean, do you really believe you
could stand in front of me?

410
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,675
And beat me in a straight up
old fashioned fist fight?

411
00:33:30,676 --> 00:33:33,651
Let me tell you something.
Me and you...

412
00:33:33,652 --> 00:33:36,820
One on one, no one else around.

413
00:33:37,384 --> 00:33:41,852
I will beat your ass
like a Cherokee drum.

414
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:45,976
Maybe one day we will find that out.

415
00:33:45,977 --> 00:33:48,355
Oh, you better hope
that day never comes.

416
00:33:57,564 --> 00:33:59,595
I said no, Mr. Nobody.

417
00:33:59,596 --> 00:34:01,734
I'm not leaving this cell.

418
00:34:01,929 --> 00:34:03,738
I'll get out my way.

419
00:34:04,435 --> 00:34:05,740
The right way.

420
00:34:11,102 --> 00:34:13,718
- Get back to your cell.
- It's just a malfunction.

421
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:15,746
- Get back!
- Just a malfunction.

422
00:34:28,416 --> 00:34:30,689
Don't let him get away.

423
00:35:02,901 --> 00:35:04,293
<i>Hobbs!

424
00:35:05,374 --> 00:35:07,669
I've been waiting a
long time for this.

425
00:35:08,409 --> 00:35:09,873
Keep waiting bitch!

426
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:17,717
Rubber bullets, big mistake.

427
00:36:39,299 --> 00:36:41,730
Ah, took longer than I expected.

428
00:36:44,068 --> 00:36:45,193
- 2 questions.
- Yeah.

429
00:36:45,194 --> 00:36:47,397
- My daughter?
- With your sister.

430
00:36:48,071 --> 00:36:51,367
- Toretto?
- That's interesting you ask.

431
00:36:52,773 --> 00:36:55,165
This is my new base,
welcome to Nowhere.

432
00:36:55,869 --> 00:36:57,516
Nice little stair for you.

433
00:36:58,711 --> 00:36:59,948
Listen, It's something I don't wanna
talk to you about...

434
00:36:59,949 --> 00:37:01,893
Hey, listen guys. Thanks..

435
00:37:01,894 --> 00:37:04,001
Whoa, whoa, what handcuff.
What is this?

436
00:37:04,002 --> 00:37:05,586
It's called the abuse of power.

437
00:37:05,587 --> 00:37:07,368
You told me to round 'em up.

438
00:37:07,369 --> 00:37:08,949
I told you that... hand..

439
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:12,082
Cut 'em loose.
Oh man, this is embarrassing.

440
00:37:12,083 --> 00:37:14,150
I'm sorry guys, what do I have?

441
00:37:14,151 --> 00:37:16,219
This is how you treat old friends?

442
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:16,884
Friend?

443
00:37:16,885 --> 00:37:19,485
We don't even really know
who the hell this guys is.

444
00:37:19,486 --> 00:37:22,086
It does not matter who I am,
Tez I'm like Nobody ok?

445
00:37:22,087 --> 00:37:22,982
Nobody, then who is he?

446
00:37:22,983 --> 00:37:24,925
He's nothing
he's like less than me.

447
00:37:24,926 --> 00:37:28,200
Clearly we're getting nowhere,
with nobody.

448
00:37:28,595 --> 00:37:31,110
I've been in here for 4 hours,
my ribs are sore.

449
00:37:31,111 --> 00:37:34,233
I don't know about y'all,
but I'm out.

450
00:37:35,101 --> 00:37:37,147
- I wouldn't recommend that.
- What?

451
00:37:37,148 --> 00:37:39,094
Well,
thanks to your bust Berlin job.

452
00:37:39,095 --> 00:37:42,132
You all made interpol's
top 10 most wanted list.

453
00:37:42,133 --> 00:37:45,105
Top 10? Uh-huh. That's alright.

454
00:37:45,106 --> 00:37:47,140
Well, not you.

455
00:37:47,141 --> 00:37:47,713
What do you mean?

456
00:37:47,714 --> 00:37:49,273
You just missed the cut,
you're number 11.

457
00:37:49,274 --> 00:37:51,872
- So.
- I missed it?

458
00:37:51,873 --> 00:37:54,070
- Yeah.
- That's impossible.

459
00:37:54,071 --> 00:37:56,269
What number did they come in at?

460
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:59,280
Six, eight, nine...

461
00:37:59,281 --> 00:38:00,586
Ten.

462
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:04,532
She's Ten? That's impossible,
there is no way she's at 10.

463
00:38:04,533 --> 00:38:06,290
Oh, She's definitely at 10.

464
00:38:07,088 --> 00:38:09,342
How about we focus
on someone who

465
00:38:09,343 --> 00:38:11,260
we're not gonna find out
in anybody's list?

466
00:38:11,261 --> 00:38:13,885
We are awaiting hard
confirmation, but...

467
00:38:13,886 --> 00:38:18,025
I believe that's the cyber
terrorist known as Cipher.

468
00:38:18,026 --> 00:38:20,286
Wait, no, Cipher's an organization.

469
00:38:20,287 --> 00:38:21,506
Not a person.

470
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:22,895
Not according to our sources.

471
00:38:22,896 --> 00:38:25,478
- What does she want?
- I don't know.

472
00:38:25,479 --> 00:38:27,861
Cipher is like a digital active God.

473
00:38:27,862 --> 00:38:31,991
They, she, can manipulate
world systems under shadows.

474
00:38:31,992 --> 00:38:33,457
Anything that can be hacked..

475
00:38:33,504 --> 00:38:34,870
And here is the kicker.

476
00:38:34,871 --> 00:38:36,997
You will never find her
linked to any other.

477
00:38:36,998 --> 00:38:40,634
Her digital identity is scrubbed
every few seconds worldwide.

478
00:38:40,638 --> 00:38:42,144
So basically, she
is the boogeyman.

479
00:38:42,145 --> 00:38:43,103
Yeah, she is.

480
00:38:43,104 --> 00:38:45,993
One of the hottest boogeyman
I have ever seen, I mean...

481
00:38:45,994 --> 00:38:49,218
If y'all know her, tell her
to get extra boy.

482
00:38:50,348 --> 00:38:52,286
- What are you, 12?
- That was my scene.

483
00:38:52,381 --> 00:38:53,816
Let's just say.

484
00:38:53,817 --> 00:38:56,002
People are scared of the
hacker group Anonymous.

485
00:38:56,017 --> 00:38:57,768
But even anonymous
won't mess with her.

486
00:38:57,769 --> 00:39:00,112
What the hell does any of this
have to do with us?

487
00:39:00,113 --> 00:39:01,735
Probably nothing, Letty. But...

488
00:39:01,736 --> 00:39:04,600
I do find it interesting,
apparently for some reason.

489
00:39:04,601 --> 00:39:06,965
She's now working with this guy.

490
00:39:22,102 --> 00:39:26,103
He's already delivered a fully
operational EMP into her hands.

491
00:39:26,104 --> 00:39:27,055
Detonate that,

492
00:39:27,056 --> 00:39:30,399
they can turn any city in
the world into a war zone.

493
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,911
So then what is it that
you're suggesting?

494
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:34,301
Maybe we find Dom huh?

495
00:39:34,302 --> 00:39:36,543
Well, first let's catch him
and then figure out

496
00:39:36,544 --> 00:39:39,494
- why he's turned.
- So y'all want us...

497
00:39:39,495 --> 00:39:40,627
To track Dom.

498
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:42,997
And I know Roman,
it's kinda a big job.

499
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:47,008
- It's impossible.
- Which is why...

500
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:49,476
I'm bringing in an
extra pair of hands.

501
00:39:54,908 --> 00:39:57,738
Ah. My day just got a
whole hell of a lot better.

502
00:39:57,739 --> 00:39:59,924
Mr. Nobody you want to tell me
why you just put me in a room

503
00:39:59,925 --> 00:40:03,587
with this teen crumpeting criminal,
some bitch.

504
00:40:03,588 --> 00:40:05,778
You got a big mouth
on a small head.

505
00:40:05,779 --> 00:40:08,039
Coming from prisoner 6753.

506
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,108
Don't think we've forgotten
everything that you've done.

507
00:40:10,109 --> 00:40:12,802
We're not...
teaming up with this guy.

508
00:40:12,803 --> 00:40:13,832
Let's get one thing clear.

509
00:40:13,833 --> 00:40:17,827
I ain't on your team.
I don't care about you, you crew...

510
00:40:17,828 --> 00:40:20,642
Your little family.
I'm here for Cipher.

511
00:40:20,643 --> 00:40:22,591
You gonna do apply for a job,
Head-asshole?

512
00:40:22,592 --> 00:40:23,960
You don't think that tight t-shirt

513
00:40:23,961 --> 00:40:25,619
is cutting off the
circulation to your brain.

514
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:27,172
You should get bigger size.

515
00:40:27,499 --> 00:40:29,726
Cipher came to me first.

516
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:31,146
Wanted me to steal
Nightshade for her.

517
00:40:31,147 --> 00:40:32,822
When I said no,
she went off to my brother.

518
00:40:32,823 --> 00:40:33,810
Oh Yes.

519
00:40:33,811 --> 00:40:36,481
Brother Owen who
could forget him?

520
00:40:36,579 --> 00:40:39,010
Former hell-raiser
and current guest,

521
00:40:39,057 --> 00:40:42,080
at a nasty little black site prison.

522
00:40:42,081 --> 00:40:44,145
Cipher corrupted him
left him for dead.

523
00:40:44,146 --> 00:40:45,611
So if I get a shot to take her down,

524
00:40:45,612 --> 00:40:47,070
believe me, flicks
I'm taking it.

525
00:40:47,071 --> 00:40:48,438
You're taking my boot
right up your ass.

526
00:40:48,439 --> 00:40:51,624
Guys, guys, guys. The fastest way
to find Cipher is through Toretto.

527
00:40:51,625 --> 00:40:54,111
Now aside from myself,
there's only two men in the world,

528
00:40:54,112 --> 00:40:55,613
that have ever managed
to actually track him..

529
00:40:55,614 --> 00:40:57,590
Down with any success.
And guess what.

530
00:40:57,591 --> 00:41:00,643
They're both standing in front
of me right now. So like it or not,

531
00:41:00,644 --> 00:41:03,086
you two are gonna work together.

532
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:05,049
You got that?

533
00:41:07,668 --> 00:41:09,293
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

534
00:41:10,086 --> 00:41:12,146
Am I the only one seeing this?

535
00:41:12,227 --> 00:41:13,980
Oh, this oughtta be good.

536
00:41:16,984 --> 00:41:20,324
Use God's eye.
We put our lives on the line..

537
00:41:20,325 --> 00:41:23,225
Running around the world
trying to figure this thing out.

538
00:41:23,226 --> 00:41:26,803
It can find anybody, right?
Let's use it to find Dom.

539
00:41:26,804 --> 00:41:30,136
Roman, that is a great idea.

540
00:41:30,915 --> 00:41:33,244
Did you hear that? Great idea.

541
00:41:33,784 --> 00:41:37,008
- And no, no! No pointing out.
- Mr. Nobody.

542
00:41:37,009 --> 00:41:38,317
Let's fire it up.. huh?

543
00:41:48,826 --> 00:41:50,359
Got him. He's in London.

544
00:41:56,432 --> 00:42:00,169
Wait, we have got a
2nd match in Hong Kong.

545
00:42:00,201 --> 00:42:04,140
- Bejing and Seole.
- And Tokyo.

546
00:42:05,804 --> 00:42:08,971
And just about every other
major city on the planet.

547
00:42:08,972 --> 00:42:11,898
And so...
God's eye was where we start.

548
00:42:11,899 --> 00:42:15,806
Cipher's already created an evasion
that masked her location by..

549
00:42:15,807 --> 00:42:18,021
Pinging random spots
all over the globe.

550
00:42:18,022 --> 00:42:20,141
But it was a good thought Roman.

551
00:42:20,947 --> 00:42:22,809
So she's made my
program obsolete.

552
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:24,136
And that Ramsey..

553
00:42:24,137 --> 00:42:27,047
- Is why are you here.
- See, simple solutions...

554
00:42:27,048 --> 00:42:28,593
aren't gonna cut it here slick.

555
00:42:30,453 --> 00:42:32,458
Why are you looking at me
when you're saying that?

556
00:42:32,459 --> 00:42:33,651
Wait a second, wait, wait.

557
00:42:33,652 --> 00:42:35,725
Simple solutions might just cut it.

558
00:42:35,726 --> 00:42:38,932
In order for God's eyes to
give up all this false pings,

559
00:42:38,981 --> 00:42:40,929
Means they have to
be using a free relay.

560
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:42,116
Watch these two.

561
00:42:42,117 --> 00:42:44,210
Which means it has a decaying
sync quantanizer.

562
00:42:44,211 --> 00:42:45,791
Which we can reverse.

563
00:42:45,792 --> 00:42:48,171
And track it back to
the originating source

564
00:42:48,172 --> 00:42:50,127
and find Dom's true location.

565
00:42:51,135 --> 00:42:52,804
Telling you, they got skills.

566
00:42:52,805 --> 00:42:54,110
That was my idea.

567
00:42:54,358 --> 00:42:56,036
That's what I was saying,
remember in there?

568
00:42:56,037 --> 00:42:57,867
Alright. Let's try this.

569
00:43:08,811 --> 00:43:09,798
It's working..

570
00:43:09,799 --> 00:43:13,141
Time you wanna take your manual
and start organizing first response...

571
00:43:13,814 --> 00:43:15,071
Let's get a hold of
our internatio...

572
00:43:15,072 --> 00:43:16,778
He's still..

573
00:43:16,779 --> 00:43:18,748
Yes, like first baby shit.

574
00:43:18,749 --> 00:43:20,109
Yes, we've tried those location...

575
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:22,246
wanna mobilize.

576
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:28,911
Let's get a hold of a, better asshole.
No one respects you, over.

577
00:43:28,912 --> 00:43:30,217
Get away from me.

578
00:43:30,791 --> 00:43:33,063
Alright they are not in China..

579
00:43:33,827 --> 00:43:35,132
Or Russia.

580
00:43:36,165 --> 00:43:37,470
Europe's clear.

581
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:41,159
But this one's not going away.

582
00:43:42,365 --> 00:43:44,103
This is interesting.

583
00:43:45,233 --> 00:43:46,538
Why?

584
00:43:47,435 --> 00:43:49,273
Because that's here.

585
00:44:29,316 --> 00:44:33,453
Did you all enjoy that?
Next generation concussion grenade.

586
00:44:33,454 --> 00:44:35,626
It scrambles your senses.

587
00:44:36,591 --> 00:44:38,534
Don't worry,
It'll wear off in an hour.

588
00:44:39,201 --> 00:44:40,733
Probably.

589
00:44:41,235 --> 00:44:44,633
Hello, Deckard.
Nice to see you again.

590
00:44:46,271 --> 00:44:49,337
Look at this,
bodies not even cold Dom.

591
00:44:49,338 --> 00:44:52,511
Your family's already replacing you.

592
00:44:53,376 --> 00:44:56,343
You chose the loosing team.

593
00:44:56,344 --> 00:44:59,684
I guess your brother
is smarter than you.

594
00:45:33,067 --> 00:45:36,293
Smart move embedding God's eye
into the mainframe.

595
00:45:36,294 --> 00:45:37,374
Irritating to make me have to come

596
00:45:37,375 --> 00:45:39,795
all the way down here to get it, but.

597
00:45:42,707 --> 00:45:44,012
Let's go.

598
00:45:50,679 --> 00:45:52,143
Dom!

599
00:46:00,718 --> 00:46:03,525
You're gonna turn
your back on family?

600
00:46:03,526 --> 00:46:05,015
Just like that?

601
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:41,208
Let's go.

602
00:47:14,798 --> 00:47:16,636
You okay?

603
00:47:19,401 --> 00:47:21,573
That wasn't him.

604
00:47:24,270 --> 00:47:26,702
I don't know what she's got on him.

605
00:47:27,306 --> 00:47:29,602
But that wasn't Dom.

606
00:47:30,341 --> 00:47:33,512
- Bryan would know what to do.
- No.

607
00:47:37,213 --> 00:47:39,712
We can't bring Bryan
and Mia into this.

608
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:42,510
We agreed on that.

609
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:45,649
I know.

610
00:47:53,035 --> 00:47:54,932
Back there was that for her,

611
00:47:54,996 --> 00:47:57,727
for me, or you?

612
00:47:58,677 --> 00:48:01,381
Or was it either necessary?

613
00:48:02,049 --> 00:48:03,514
Necessary?

614
00:48:04,119 --> 00:48:07,520
Nothing is necessary.
Everything is a choice.

615
00:48:08,092 --> 00:48:10,402
I simply made one but so did you.

616
00:48:10,669 --> 00:48:12,973
You could have stopped me,
but you chose not to do.

617
00:48:12,974 --> 00:48:15,465
I wonder what Letty
thought about that.

618
00:48:17,306 --> 00:48:20,250
The problem of putting your foot
on a Tiger's neck...

619
00:48:20,251 --> 00:48:22,113
is you can never let it up.

620
00:48:22,114 --> 00:48:26,149
I think I need to remind you
why you chose to be here.

621
00:49:01,574 --> 00:49:03,376
Dom.

622
00:49:10,087 --> 00:49:12,384
Sorry.

623
00:49:14,026 --> 00:49:16,161
You shoudn't have come.

624
00:49:16,162 --> 00:49:18,260
Nothing's gonna get me away.

625
00:49:18,261 --> 00:49:20,436
Now she has the three of us.

626
00:49:26,578 --> 00:49:28,552
You wanna see him?

627
00:49:32,687 --> 00:49:34,010
See papa.

628
00:49:41,635 --> 00:49:43,541
Papa.

629
00:49:52,686 --> 00:49:55,221
When I realized I was pregnant.

630
00:49:55,222 --> 00:49:57,588
You had just find out
Letty was alive.

631
00:49:59,128 --> 00:50:02,266
So I decided when Letty and you
go back from your honeymoon.

632
00:50:02,267 --> 00:50:04,564
I was going to tell you.

633
00:50:06,742 --> 00:50:09,347
And then she took us
before I had the chance.

634
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:20,632
I call him Michaels.

635
00:50:22,164 --> 00:50:24,529
That his middle name.

636
00:50:25,168 --> 00:50:28,501
I thought his father should
give him first name.

637
00:50:38,488 --> 00:50:40,785
I'm sorry, Dom.

638
00:50:41,093 --> 00:50:43,767
There is nothing to be sorry for.

639
00:50:46,619 --> 00:50:47,932
Whatever happens...

640
00:50:49,505 --> 00:50:51,870
Just save our son.

641
00:50:55,081 --> 00:50:56,981
Your son.

642
00:51:11,542 --> 00:51:14,346
P s a g m e n o . com

643
00:51:17,615 --> 00:51:18,921
Good visit?

644
00:51:21,654 --> 00:51:24,054
I know. I know what
you're thinking.

645
00:51:25,761 --> 00:51:27,710
I just let the guards go,

646
00:51:27,711 --> 00:51:30,270
so there is only two opponents
in the room.

647
00:51:30,271 --> 00:51:34,067
Rhodes has the gun, so you'll
take him out first, I know you.

648
00:51:34,708 --> 00:51:36,777
And then you're thinking.

649
00:51:36,778 --> 00:51:39,353
Elena is a cop,
maybe the two of you

650
00:51:39,354 --> 00:51:41,551
can fight your way out of here.

651
00:51:41,552 --> 00:51:44,019
So much to think about.

652
00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:51,930
Let me make it easier for you.

653
00:51:57,710 --> 00:52:00,041
Do with it as you wish.

654
00:52:07,725 --> 00:52:10,562
Have you heard of choice theory Dom?

655
00:52:10,563 --> 00:52:12,012
There's a bunch of axiems

656
00:52:12,013 --> 00:52:14,668
but only two you really need
to concern yourself with,

657
00:52:14,669 --> 00:52:15,867
One.

658
00:52:15,868 --> 00:52:19,489
The only person's behavior
we can control is our own.

659
00:52:19,644 --> 00:52:23,215
And two, the only thing we
can truly give another person

660
00:52:23,216 --> 00:52:26,024
is information, so let me
give you some.

661
00:52:26,822 --> 00:52:29,579
You see this cameras in here?

662
00:52:30,093 --> 00:52:31,555
The moment you make a move,

663
00:52:31,556 --> 00:52:33,574
highly paid men with weapons,

664
00:52:33,575 --> 00:52:35,267
will make there way into this room.

665
00:52:35,268 --> 00:52:38,739
With one very...
specific instruction.

666
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:41,913
It's not to save me.

667
00:52:42,245 --> 00:52:45,018
It's to kill your son.

668
00:52:45,583 --> 00:52:47,363
And that's a lot of bullets.

669
00:52:47,711 --> 00:52:50,559
And it only takes one
for you to loose everything.

670
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:52,734
So, I have to ask you, because...

671
00:52:52,794 --> 00:52:57,094
I know family is so
important to you.

672
00:52:59,572 --> 00:53:02,847
Is that really a choice
you wanna make?

673
00:53:05,647 --> 00:53:08,080
Because I'm ready as you are.

674
00:53:11,623 --> 00:53:14,899
I pull this trigger, and
God knows I wanna..

675
00:53:15,629 --> 00:53:18,131
I'll kill everyone on this plane...

676
00:53:18,567 --> 00:53:20,898
I still couldn't get in there.

677
00:53:21,306 --> 00:53:24,881
Cause you here
manipulate this system.

678
00:53:25,144 --> 00:53:27,105
Since I'm alone!

679
00:53:29,618 --> 00:53:32,051
I got no choice!

680
00:53:40,601 --> 00:53:42,966
I don't think so.

681
00:54:13,652 --> 00:54:16,051
You want to see the old Dom?

682
00:54:18,258 --> 00:54:19,995
Watch.

683
00:54:38,770 --> 00:54:40,075
Damn it..

684
00:54:40,445 --> 00:54:42,777
She wiped it off.
Took God's eye.

685
00:54:43,703 --> 00:54:46,566
That was the one thing
we could use to find him.

686
00:54:46,567 --> 00:54:47,982
We lost everything.

687
00:54:49,989 --> 00:54:54,504
- Yeah, princess?
- Find it to rail.

688
00:54:54,505 --> 00:54:56,232
But I've got
couple of minutes to spare.

689
00:54:56,233 --> 00:54:59,963
If you want me to send
you to the hospital again.

690
00:55:00,364 --> 00:55:02,405
- Yo Rules!
- First off,

691
00:55:02,406 --> 00:55:04,412
- That's not my name.
- Little nobody.

692
00:55:04,413 --> 00:55:06,355
- Don't call me that.
- Oh that's definitely stinky.

693
00:55:06,356 --> 00:55:08,767
Great do me a favor, and tell
your majesty over there,

694
00:55:08,768 --> 00:55:11,827
that we're gonna find Toretto.
We find Toretto together as a team.

695
00:55:11,843 --> 00:55:13,263
When this is all over,
you have me to

696
00:55:13,264 --> 00:55:15,551
slap that whickest biscuit
right off his face.

697
00:55:15,552 --> 00:55:17,775
Wait a minute, guys. I think
Decker's actually onto something.

698
00:55:17,776 --> 00:55:19,238
How do you think
Dom and Cipher got

699
00:55:19,239 --> 00:55:21,433
into the country
without us knowing?

700
00:55:22,157 --> 00:55:24,197
- Ghost flights.
- That untraceable aircraft

701
00:55:24,198 --> 00:55:26,292
it was all internet
conspiracy stuff.

702
00:55:26,293 --> 00:55:27,324
It's not.

703
00:55:27,325 --> 00:55:29,892
Satellites and radar grids...

704
00:55:29,893 --> 00:55:32,196
All across the globe shift.

705
00:55:32,296 --> 00:55:35,851
Like an ocean. And they've got
channels that open and close.

706
00:55:35,852 --> 00:55:37,957
And theoretically, if you
know the right people who...

707
00:55:37,958 --> 00:55:39,011
Know the right patterns.

708
00:55:39,012 --> 00:55:41,300
You can fly right through
the blind's box...

709
00:55:41,301 --> 00:55:42,595
can't be intercepted.

710
00:55:42,596 --> 00:55:44,973
So you know where Dom is headed?

711
00:55:45,378 --> 00:55:47,964
Yeah, New York.

712
00:55:50,370 --> 00:55:51,420
You see there Luke..

713
00:55:51,421 --> 00:55:53,692
You guys...
are gonna get along just great.

714
00:55:53,693 --> 00:55:57,051
Which proves, rule number two,
you never lose everything.

715
00:55:57,513 --> 00:55:59,042
Fire up the chopper.

716
00:55:59,511 --> 00:56:01,756
Guys, have a bowl
and a Big Apple.

717
00:56:25,523 --> 00:56:27,587
Are we travelling like this again?

718
00:56:27,588 --> 00:56:30,946
Because Dom took God's Eye,
so we need to stay off the grid.

719
00:56:31,550 --> 00:56:32,870
But like this?

720
00:56:37,282 --> 00:56:39,631
Look here man.
Before I throw up in my mouth...

721
00:56:39,632 --> 00:56:41,904
Let me ask you
what are we doing here?

722
00:56:41,905 --> 00:56:43,969
That's a good question, Roman.

723
00:56:45,102 --> 00:56:46,898
Let me show you.

724
00:56:50,495 --> 00:56:53,091
Welcome to our new
base of operations.

725
00:56:53,092 --> 00:56:56,417
Now seriously,
what is this place?

726
00:56:56,455 --> 00:56:59,322
This... is heaven.

727
00:57:04,846 --> 00:57:08,310
The agency garage.
We call it the toy shop.

728
00:57:15,335 --> 00:57:17,160
This is where we house every vehicles

729
00:57:17,161 --> 00:57:19,368
seized from drug
dealers of East coast.

730
00:57:19,463 --> 00:57:21,295
Now. Mr nobody said..

731
00:57:21,296 --> 00:57:23,557
If we're gonna have a chance
of catching Dom..

732
00:57:24,957 --> 00:57:27,351
We're gonna have to
be damn fast.

733
00:57:28,442 --> 00:57:29,978
Maybe this could help.

734
00:57:33,681 --> 00:57:37,410
We got a tank. 750 horsepower.

735
00:57:37,411 --> 00:57:41,372
6.6 liter V8 Duramax engine.

736
00:57:41,373 --> 00:57:45,434
With the M153 probe remotely
operated weapon station on top.

737
00:57:45,435 --> 00:57:47,499
You didn't get this
from drug dealers.

738
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:50,206
No. No that...

739
00:57:50,391 --> 00:57:51,890
United State's army weaponry.

740
00:57:51,891 --> 00:57:53,362
See the army developing
machines like this

741
00:57:53,363 --> 00:57:56,422
the soldiers could drive from a
mile way so they can stay safe.

742
00:57:56,423 --> 00:57:59,352
And alive. But luckily..

743
00:57:59,353 --> 00:58:03,218
There is a back up driver seat for
those of us who like to get more..

744
00:58:03,410 --> 00:58:04,500
Hands on.

745
00:58:04,501 --> 00:58:07,667
I'm sitting there wondering this whole time
when this thing feeling badly

746
00:58:07,668 --> 00:58:08,973
and she's getting fact.

747
00:58:09,376 --> 00:58:13,768
No one is getting hands on it.
She doesn't go on some streets.

748
00:58:18,466 --> 00:58:20,667
I'm in love.

749
00:58:22,728 --> 00:58:26,423
Again? No. No...
That's a million dollar show car.

750
00:58:26,424 --> 00:58:28,619
The point is to not draw attention.

751
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:30,419
It's reverse psychology.

752
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:32,283
Dom will never see it coming.

753
00:58:32,284 --> 00:58:33,448
It's neon orange,

754
00:58:33,449 --> 00:58:36,717
The international space station
would see it coming.

755
00:58:37,212 --> 00:58:39,963
Go choose anything less inspeculous.

756
00:58:39,964 --> 00:58:40,988
No no.

757
00:58:40,989 --> 00:58:44,565
This is ridiculous. Hey my man,
you can put that down right there.

758
00:58:44,570 --> 00:58:46,664
This is a gift. A real gift.

759
00:58:46,801 --> 00:58:48,172
I know what you're doing.

760
00:58:48,899 --> 00:58:51,195
I like your beard.
You're blanta.

761
00:58:51,196 --> 00:58:53,465
Black santa?

762
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:56,520
No, I'm serious.
Put it down right here..

763
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,065
What are you doing?

764
00:59:25,165 --> 00:59:27,271
Engine's mis-firing,
I gotta check it out.

765
00:59:27,272 --> 00:59:29,344
No. That's not part
of the plan, Dom.

766
00:59:29,345 --> 00:59:30,247
Clearly..

767
00:59:30,248 --> 00:59:33,586
But unless you want the engine
to cease on the job,

768
00:59:34,294 --> 00:59:36,537
You have five minutes.

769
00:59:48,205 --> 00:59:50,023
I want another visual.

770
00:59:57,401 --> 00:59:59,030
I got an ATM.

771
01:00:11,009 --> 01:00:12,391
I don't like this.

772
01:00:25,890 --> 01:00:27,176
I want to see Toretto.

773
01:00:27,177 --> 01:00:28,230
There are no more cameras.

774
01:00:28,231 --> 01:00:29,308
Then find something.

775
01:00:29,309 --> 01:00:32,636
Punch in on something reflective
A car mirror, anything..

776
01:00:43,044 --> 01:00:46,554
- You know who I am?
- That's why I'm here.

777
01:00:46,555 --> 01:00:49,630
You know what I'm capable of.

778
01:00:50,468 --> 01:00:52,802
It's why I'm here.

779
01:00:53,410 --> 01:00:55,813
I'll give you until
I finish my cup up.

780
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:57,550
And I'm fucking thirsty.

781
01:00:57,695 --> 01:01:01,797
I got limited time.
So won't take up too much of yours.

782
01:01:02,439 --> 01:01:03,641
Oh no.

783
01:01:03,642 --> 01:01:07,380
No, you've already taken everything
I have of value, Mr. Toretto,

784
01:01:07,381 --> 01:01:09,456
What more could you possibly want?

785
01:01:10,197 --> 01:01:12,532
To give you something back.

786
01:01:21,658 --> 01:01:23,189
Talk to me.

787
01:01:26,148 --> 01:01:28,516
Something's not right here.

788
01:01:29,057 --> 01:01:31,430
First time I saw my son...

789
01:01:31,431 --> 01:01:34,340
was behind a bulletproof glass.

790
01:01:34,573 --> 01:01:38,523
When he reached me,
I couldn't hold on.

791
01:01:39,323 --> 01:01:42,467
It's the worst pain
I ever felt..

792
01:01:43,101 --> 01:01:45,641
I know you know
exactly how that feels.

793
01:01:47,314 --> 01:01:50,389
Maybe we could change that..

794
01:01:51,507 --> 01:01:52,415
I think..

795
01:01:52,416 --> 01:01:56,566
You are about to suggest
something really dodgy Mr Toretto.

796
01:02:02,161 --> 01:02:04,530
It's why I'm here.

797
01:02:05,639 --> 01:02:08,179
Just punch in on something,
I'm not liking this.

798
01:02:08,180 --> 01:02:10,015
Something is not right.

799
01:02:10,016 --> 01:02:12,535
- Rhodes, you close?
- Yeah.

800
01:02:12,626 --> 01:02:15,872
- Go.
- The delivery truck's moving.

801
01:02:47,692 --> 01:02:49,497
Captain Deckard Shaw,

802
01:02:50,462 --> 01:02:53,164
distinguished himself
by acts of gallantry

803
01:02:53,165 --> 01:02:56,405
of the risk of his life above
and beyond the call of duty.

804
01:02:56,734 --> 01:03:00,567
His bold actions saved the lives of
hostages and his team mates.

805
01:03:01,073 --> 01:03:04,409
Recommendation: Victoria Cross.

806
01:03:04,577 --> 01:03:07,451
Highest honor the British Government
has ever given.

807
01:03:08,847 --> 01:03:10,152
To a traitor.

808
01:03:12,118 --> 01:03:14,373
Some about this old thing just
doesn't add up to me.

809
01:03:14,374 --> 01:03:16,583
Well then don't do the same
kind of funny math,

810
01:03:16,923 --> 01:03:21,160
It says a DSS agent who has a
soul to stop a valid stolen EMP.

811
01:03:21,161 --> 01:03:23,457
Sound familiar huh?

812
01:03:30,237 --> 01:03:31,860
Wanna give me a hand?

813
01:03:34,908 --> 01:03:36,222
- On three?
- Yeah.

814
01:03:36,223 --> 01:03:37,528
One two..

815
01:03:41,216 --> 01:03:43,394
You know, you can tell this in
another letter..

816
01:03:43,395 --> 01:03:45,620
But maybe we could've caused
some serious damage.

817
01:03:46,121 --> 01:03:48,451
- Yes, we could have.
- Yeah.

818
01:03:49,157 --> 01:03:50,509
Shame I'll have to punch you,

819
01:03:50,510 --> 01:03:52,556
head of defend,
when this is all over.

820
01:03:54,662 --> 01:03:57,098
Ah well.
With all due respect, Captain,

821
01:03:57,099 --> 01:03:59,167
When this whole thing is over
we're gonna find a location

822
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:01,236
and I'm gonna knock your teeth
so far down your throat.

823
01:04:01,237 --> 01:04:04,409
You're gonna stick a toothbrush
right up in your ass to brush up.

824
01:04:11,147 --> 01:04:13,212
Give me God's eyes.

825
01:04:13,449 --> 01:04:16,148
- God's eye active.
- Thanks.

826
01:04:16,619 --> 01:04:18,854
Let's find us some Russian.

827
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:21,757
That spy with my little lie...

828
01:04:21,758 --> 01:04:24,832
Minister of defense.

829
01:04:41,497 --> 01:04:43,848
<i>We land back in Moscow by nine.

830
01:04:43,849 --> 01:04:48,892
<i>Here's the latest defense report,
All the items in yesterday's meet.

831
01:04:50,488 --> 01:04:51,897
Upload this coordinates
to Dom's nav.

832
01:04:51,898 --> 01:04:53,203
Copy that.

833
01:05:16,616 --> 01:05:18,855
He's in the third car.

834
01:05:19,152 --> 01:05:21,918
It's a guard class limousine.

835
01:05:35,569 --> 01:05:36,932
Where's my team?

836
01:05:37,004 --> 01:05:39,005
- Where's his team?
- There's no sign of 'em yet.

837
01:05:39,006 --> 01:05:40,473
They are off the grid.

838
01:05:40,474 --> 01:05:42,508
Probably just bunker down somewhere.

839
01:05:42,509 --> 01:05:44,748
Closing in on him.

840
01:05:45,746 --> 01:05:46,646
You guys ready?

841
01:05:46,647 --> 01:05:48,943
One thing I can guarantee you Dom.

842
01:05:49,016 --> 01:05:51,052
No one's ready for this.

843
01:05:51,053 --> 01:05:53,113
I want every with
chip with the GEODIE exploits

844
01:05:53,114 --> 01:05:55,723
in a two mile radius
around that motorcade now.

845
01:05:55,724 --> 01:05:57,224
There's over a thousands of them.

846
01:05:57,225 --> 01:05:59,095
Hack 'em all.

847
01:06:15,978 --> 01:06:17,448
It's zombie time.

848
01:06:25,488 --> 01:06:27,618
I'd buckle up if I were you.

849
01:06:27,919 --> 01:06:29,224
<i>AUTO-DRIVE ACTIVATED.

850
01:07:29,789 --> 01:07:31,094
<i>Hey...!

851
01:07:39,265 --> 01:07:41,338
Target the motorcade.

852
01:07:51,177 --> 01:07:53,346
And here they come.

853
01:07:57,918 --> 01:07:59,315
<i>What is going on?

854
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:02,156
Ouch.

855
01:08:04,249 --> 01:08:05,557
<i>Drive fast!

856
01:08:10,898 --> 01:08:12,222
Police escort down..

857
01:08:12,534 --> 01:08:15,266
Take out the lead and follow cars.

858
01:08:30,632 --> 01:08:32,213
<i>Drive! Drive!

859
01:08:41,564 --> 01:08:43,955
- Two more down.
- Still a new warranty.

860
01:08:43,956 --> 01:08:47,209
<i>There's more cars ahead of us.
Shoot their engines.

861
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:56,425
<i>Oh God!

862
01:09:09,860 --> 01:09:11,961
<i>We got an army of cars
driving themselves.

863
01:09:11,962 --> 01:09:13,348
<i>Send backup! Send S.W.A.T!

864
01:09:13,349 --> 01:09:15,563
<i>I don't care if you send the
goddamn boy scout...

865
01:09:15,564 --> 01:09:19,072
<i>- Just send up some help!</i>
- Now that's Dom.

866
01:09:23,937 --> 01:09:25,573
<i>Faster, faster!

867
01:09:46,966 --> 01:09:48,900
The motorcade just turned on 7th.

868
01:09:48,901 --> 01:09:51,265
Perfect. Make it rain.

869
01:10:48,931 --> 01:10:51,101
Target immobilized.

870
01:10:51,301 --> 01:10:53,232
You are up Dom.

871
01:11:07,292 --> 01:11:10,387
<i>- Who the hell is that?
- What is he doing?

872
01:11:13,394 --> 01:11:14,960
<i>What the hell
are you waiting for?

873
01:11:14,961 --> 01:11:16,506
<i>Shoot him!

874
01:11:16,646 --> 01:11:18,846
<i>Come on, come on!

875
01:11:27,092 --> 01:11:28,578
<i>I'm out.

876
01:11:30,779 --> 01:11:31,172
<i>Shit.

877
01:11:31,173 --> 01:11:33,827
<i>Don't worry sir.
This car is bulletproof.

878
01:11:33,828 --> 01:11:35,713
<i>You'll be safe in here.

879
01:11:39,416 --> 01:11:41,436
<i>- Give me the case.
- Give him the case.

880
01:11:41,437 --> 01:11:45,827
<i>These are nuclear launch codes.
We cannot give it to him.

881
01:11:50,716 --> 01:11:52,458
<i>What is he doing now?

882
01:12:09,022 --> 01:12:11,542
<i>He just cut a hole
in our gas tank.

883
01:12:37,978 --> 01:12:40,380
Good work, Dom.

884
01:12:40,381 --> 01:12:41,929
Meet you at the pick-up.

885
01:12:52,156 --> 01:12:54,203
I think I know
where my team's at.

886
01:12:54,295 --> 01:12:57,535
- Where?
- Right in front of me.

887
01:13:08,877 --> 01:13:12,313
This is on you.
Get out of there, Dom.

888
01:13:12,314 --> 01:13:14,121
Guys, I know why Dom's here.

889
01:13:14,318 --> 01:13:17,309
Police scanners are saying
he's stolen Nuclear Football.

890
01:13:20,257 --> 01:13:23,889
It's over, Toretto.
Get your ass out of the car now.

891
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:32,145
That's how you wanna play this?

892
01:13:32,602 --> 01:13:33,975
Let's play.

893
01:13:40,011 --> 01:13:41,841
Don't do this, Dom.

894
01:13:47,118 --> 01:13:48,953
- What're you doing?
- It's a trap!

895
01:14:13,779 --> 01:14:16,429
Now I know what it feels like
be every cop ever chasing us.

896
01:14:16,430 --> 01:14:18,003
I'm gonna get a
little close and I ped him.

897
01:14:18,004 --> 01:14:19,856
Oh, so you just gonna take Dom?

898
01:14:20,153 --> 01:14:23,726
Little Nobody has clearly
lost his little mind.

899
01:14:36,070 --> 01:14:36,870
I'm on him.

900
01:14:36,871 --> 01:14:39,076
Easy, work together.

901
01:14:47,381 --> 01:14:49,556
<i>- Look out!</i>
- Wait, wait, wait!

902
01:14:51,151 --> 01:14:52,456
Oh shit.

903
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:00,453
I will take the short cut.

904
01:15:13,375 --> 01:15:15,190
Look out! Watch these people.

905
01:15:16,143 --> 01:15:18,122
Big Sexy coming through!

906
01:15:47,344 --> 01:15:49,029
Not this time, Dom.

907
01:16:47,841 --> 01:16:50,045
Stretch him out. Hold them.

908
01:17:17,872 --> 01:17:20,246
He gotta have about
2000 Horse Power in that thing.

909
01:17:20,575 --> 01:17:22,145
Try 3000..

910
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:27,219
Try Five.

911
01:17:35,175 --> 01:17:36,536
Get out of there.

912
01:17:36,537 --> 01:17:37,593
I'm working on it.

913
01:17:37,594 --> 01:17:40,061
Stop working on it, and do it..

914
01:17:51,808 --> 01:17:54,282
No, no no... It's my Bentley.

915
01:18:04,554 --> 01:18:05,859
No!

916
01:18:33,552 --> 01:18:36,849
Get that case and run!

917
01:18:48,134 --> 01:18:49,765
Move!

918
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:57,133
They thought...
this was gonna be a streetfight.

919
01:18:57,134 --> 01:18:58,538
You wait for it..

920
01:19:01,981 --> 01:19:03,286
No!

921
01:19:15,596 --> 01:19:17,801
Letty, stop!

922
01:19:21,636 --> 01:19:23,869
What are you gonna do?

923
01:19:36,118 --> 01:19:40,887
I don't know why you're doing this,
but I know one thing.

924
01:19:41,456 --> 01:19:43,729
You love me.

925
01:19:47,196 --> 01:19:49,896
And you're not gonna to shoot me.

926
01:20:00,544 --> 01:20:04,511
You should've given him the case,
cause I won't chase you.

927
01:20:06,150 --> 01:20:07,881
Okay.

928
01:20:07,925 --> 01:20:10,455
I will just take it
from a dead girl.

929
01:20:12,522 --> 01:20:14,328
You willing to die for it?

930
01:20:32,576 --> 01:20:34,446
Let's go then.

931
01:20:55,317 --> 01:20:57,018
Anything?

932
01:20:57,019 --> 01:20:59,155
They're gone.

933
01:20:59,721 --> 01:21:02,423
And D.O.D confirmed
it was a nuclear football.

934
01:21:02,424 --> 01:21:05,926
He's got an EMP and
nuclear launch codes.

935
01:21:05,927 --> 01:21:07,478
I don't know what it is,

936
01:21:07,479 --> 01:21:09,929
but they're building
towards something.

937
01:21:09,930 --> 01:21:12,100
Deckard?

938
01:21:12,867 --> 01:21:14,172
He didn't make it.

939
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:37,333
I'm disappointed in you, Dom.

940
01:21:38,952 --> 01:21:41,824
You're gonna Letty just walk
away with the codes.

941
01:21:41,825 --> 01:21:44,827
- You've got the codes!
- Rhodes got the codes.

942
01:21:44,828 --> 01:21:48,159
You made the choice
to let her go.

943
01:21:48,931 --> 01:21:51,295
And now I have to make
one on my own.

944
01:22:02,944 --> 01:22:07,517
They are adorable little things,
aren't they?

945
01:22:07,648 --> 01:22:09,612
I hope I don't hurt him.

946
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:17,525
Look, Cipher, I did exactly
what you asked me to do.

947
01:22:17,790 --> 01:22:19,102
Don't do this.

948
01:22:19,103 --> 01:22:22,630
- This is your doing.
- My doing?

949
01:22:31,602 --> 01:22:33,632
Please don't hurt him.
I'm begging you.

950
01:22:33,638 --> 01:22:36,441
I don't want you to beg.

951
01:22:38,542 --> 01:22:42,044
- I want you to learn.
- Learn what?

952
01:22:42,679 --> 01:22:47,943
I understand why you did
what you did. I really do.

953
01:22:53,155 --> 01:22:55,027
But it was the wrong choice.

954
01:22:56,023 --> 01:22:58,997
This is a consequence, Dom.

955
01:23:00,094 --> 01:23:02,933
No! No! No...

956
01:23:03,663 --> 01:23:05,895
Wait. Wait.

957
01:23:07,601 --> 01:23:09,897
No!

958
01:23:36,125 --> 01:23:39,528
Can you pull up the footage
from the guy in the ally.

959
01:23:39,529 --> 01:23:42,029
- Traffic cams.
- I got you.

960
01:23:46,101 --> 01:23:49,670
I knew it. I recognize that guy.

961
01:23:49,671 --> 01:23:51,204
That's Connor Rhodes.

962
01:23:51,205 --> 01:23:53,705
I met him when I was working
with Shaw's brother.

963
01:23:54,341 --> 01:23:56,647
He wanted us to get the
Nightshade device him.

964
01:23:57,077 --> 01:23:58,513
Connor Rhodes.

965
01:23:58,978 --> 01:24:01,880
He's also linked to somebody
who I like to forget.

966
01:24:01,881 --> 01:24:03,346
Mose Jakande.

967
01:24:03,883 --> 01:24:05,918
Warlord who tried to get God's eye.

968
01:24:05,919 --> 01:24:09,557
Which means that's twice that
Dom has messed up Cipher's business.

969
01:24:22,033 --> 01:24:23,899
Everything you're feeling right now,

970
01:24:23,900 --> 01:24:28,171
that's rage, sense of loss.
It's not real.

971
01:24:28,172 --> 01:24:32,263
It's a survival instinct wired
deep into our brains.

972
01:24:32,264 --> 01:24:35,977
To ensure continuation of species.

973
01:24:35,978 --> 01:24:39,110
When early men went visit
a watering hole...

974
01:24:39,814 --> 01:24:45,085
If they didn't watch their child,
they got snatched by a crocodile.

975
01:24:45,086 --> 01:24:52,196
Their brains would create a painful
but a structural memory.

976
01:24:52,626 --> 01:24:55,258
So it will never happen again.

977
01:24:56,796 --> 01:24:59,931
This idea of family
that is so core with you,

978
01:24:59,932 --> 01:25:02,262
that rules your world...

979
01:25:02,969 --> 01:25:06,174
It's a biological lie.

980
01:25:06,905 --> 01:25:09,269
You don't have to accept it.

981
01:25:10,909 --> 01:25:12,472
I don't!

982
01:25:14,979 --> 01:25:18,281
Did you really could think
you could destroy two of my teams.

983
01:25:18,282 --> 01:25:20,315
Without any repercussions?

984
01:25:20,917 --> 01:25:23,232
I wouldn't have even
looked your way..

985
01:25:23,233 --> 01:25:24,786
If you hadn't done that.

986
01:25:24,787 --> 01:25:27,253
You didn't even know you had a kid.

987
01:25:27,924 --> 01:25:29,383
You can thank me for that.

988
01:25:29,384 --> 01:25:31,792
And start doing the job
I'm asking you to do.

989
01:25:31,793 --> 01:25:33,027
Help you start a war.

990
01:25:33,028 --> 01:25:35,301
Is that what you think I want.

991
01:25:37,832 --> 01:25:40,196
That's so limited.

992
01:25:40,868 --> 01:25:43,003
I didn't take that
football to start a war..

993
01:25:43,004 --> 01:25:46,243
Anymore than I took your son
to start a family.

994
01:25:46,773 --> 01:25:48,874
Taking your son got me the codes..

995
01:25:48,875 --> 01:25:50,855
The codes will get me the nukes,

996
01:25:50,856 --> 01:25:53,378
and the nukes will
get me what I want...

997
01:25:53,379 --> 01:25:58,049
Today, tomorrow...
and every day after that.

998
01:25:58,050 --> 01:26:00,220
What's that?

999
01:26:01,619 --> 01:26:04,058
Accountability.

1000
01:26:05,557 --> 01:26:07,924
The second I fire off
one of those nukes..

1001
01:26:07,925 --> 01:26:10,926
I put the superpowers of this world
on notice that...

1002
01:26:10,927 --> 01:26:13,257
when they cross the line,

1003
01:26:15,332 --> 01:26:19,136
I'm gonna be there
to hold the responsible..

1004
01:26:19,769 --> 01:26:21,936
Because the truth is, Dom...

1005
01:26:21,937 --> 01:26:24,301
To the world out there...

1006
01:26:26,775 --> 01:26:30,140
I'm the crocodile
at the watering hole.

1007
01:26:35,483 --> 01:26:37,571
You've got one last job to do.

1008
01:26:38,952 --> 01:26:41,157
Cipher..

1009
01:26:49,929 --> 01:26:53,202
If I were you,
I would kiss my son.

1010
01:26:54,966 --> 01:26:58,890
Because whether you value it or not,
all of this...

1011
01:26:59,837 --> 01:27:03,002
Your plane, your security and you...

1012
01:27:04,041 --> 01:27:06,779
are still on this
earth because of him.

1013
01:27:12,015 --> 01:27:13,615
The problem we have
with tracking Cipher

1014
01:27:13,616 --> 01:27:14,949
is there's nothing to trace then.

1015
01:27:14,950 --> 01:27:16,692
Now we have Rhodes' information.

1016
01:27:16,699 --> 01:27:18,483
And we're getting
snapshots of this data

1017
01:27:18,484 --> 01:27:20,221
before it's scrubbed off the net.

1018
01:27:20,222 --> 01:27:22,889
That looks like somebody's
bank accounts? Always just...

1019
01:27:22,890 --> 01:27:24,825
The Longitude.

1020
01:27:24,826 --> 01:27:27,027
Given the fact that Dom
hit the Russian Motorcade

1021
01:27:27,028 --> 01:27:30,268
safe to say it's Russia.
Go ahead, bring up the map.

1022
01:27:30,632 --> 01:27:32,954
Great, let's start here
run the possibilities.

1023
01:27:33,467 --> 01:27:36,073
Yalta, Poltava.

1024
01:27:36,074 --> 01:27:37,970
Looks like they just threw
letters together.

1025
01:27:37,971 --> 01:27:40,280
- Konyert.
- It's Vladupi.

1026
01:27:40,281 --> 01:27:41,586
What are you doing here?

1027
01:27:42,107 --> 01:27:44,217
Thought I was gonna check in on you
from time to time,

1028
01:27:44,218 --> 01:27:45,302
To see you how you're doing.

1029
01:27:45,303 --> 01:27:47,174
By the way, not so hot.

1030
01:27:47,175 --> 01:27:49,840
But there's nothing in Vladiven.
It's just ice..

1031
01:27:49,841 --> 01:27:51,167
That funny...

1032
01:27:51,350 --> 01:27:53,360
Could've sworn there was a
secret Russian naval base

1033
01:27:53,361 --> 01:27:55,485
with the retrophilic
cold war Submarines.

1034
01:27:55,753 --> 01:27:58,219
Well, technically,
it's not Russian anymore.

1035
01:27:58,300 --> 01:28:00,948
Base was take by a terror grope
of military separatists

1036
01:28:00,949 --> 01:28:03,393
about a month ago. And the
Russians haven't taken it back yet.

1037
01:28:03,394 --> 01:28:05,961
So there is a little
window of opportunity here.

1038
01:28:05,962 --> 01:28:08,397
Russian submarines,
nuclear football,

1039
01:28:08,398 --> 01:28:11,932
it sounds like everything we do
our legs gonna be bombed off.

1040
01:28:11,933 --> 01:28:15,298
Sounds like you're still
a No. 11 on the list.

1041
01:28:15,804 --> 01:28:18,232
It sounds like you've changed
since you look punk ass.

1042
01:28:18,233 --> 01:28:19,728
Facial hairs and camen.

1043
01:28:19,729 --> 01:28:21,559
Guys... guys. Hey.

1044
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:23,211
We gotta call this in
all the way up the chain.

1045
01:28:23,212 --> 01:28:24,511
That's good thinking champ.

1046
01:28:24,512 --> 01:28:28,381
Except... unfortunately the
Russian Minister of Defense.

1047
01:28:28,382 --> 01:28:31,375
Got himself involved in little
incident on US territory

1048
01:28:31,418 --> 01:28:33,352
and two governments
aren't talking to each other for a while.

1049
01:28:33,353 --> 01:28:35,191
By the time they do...
It will be too late.

1050
01:28:35,192 --> 01:28:36,860
So, any other suggestions?

1051
01:28:37,390 --> 01:28:39,856
Yeah, I got one.

1052
01:28:40,393 --> 01:28:42,427
How about we just
stop them ourselves?

1053
01:28:42,428 --> 01:28:44,528
You're talking about a
Russian Military Base.

1054
01:28:44,529 --> 01:28:45,462
Separatists.

1055
01:28:45,463 --> 01:28:46,934
Whatever. It's suicide.

1056
01:28:46,935 --> 01:28:48,870
It's stopping world war 3.

1057
01:28:50,534 --> 01:28:51,835
What's it gonna be rook?

1058
01:28:51,836 --> 01:28:54,199
You're gonna close your eyes
on this one too?

1059
01:28:54,437 --> 01:28:55,790
Pray that the apocalypse

1060
01:28:55,791 --> 01:28:58,307
doesn't come knocking on
your mama's front door?

1061
01:28:58,308 --> 01:29:00,184
Or are you're gonna saddle up,

1062
01:29:00,185 --> 01:29:03,433
be a man and save the
entire goddamn world.

1063
01:29:09,317 --> 01:29:12,352
You know, thank god
they read it out.

1064
01:29:12,353 --> 01:29:13,353
What's that?

1065
01:29:13,354 --> 01:29:15,619
- Rule number three.
- Which is?

1066
01:29:16,624 --> 01:29:18,020
There are no rules.

1067
01:29:20,227 --> 01:29:21,932
What did I told you, Luke?

1068
01:29:22,095 --> 01:29:23,534
I knew he'd get in three.

1069
01:29:23,729 --> 01:29:25,064
Areal transport leaves in an hour.

1070
01:29:25,065 --> 01:29:26,665
Take whatever vehicle you want.

1071
01:29:26,666 --> 01:29:29,544
- All bets are off.
- All bets are off. Bets are off?

1072
01:29:29,545 --> 01:29:31,038
<i>See you later...

1073
01:29:56,939 --> 01:29:59,046
Letty I don't like telling
you this one thing,

1074
01:29:59,047 --> 01:30:00,918
The game's changed.

1075
01:30:00,974 --> 01:30:02,881
Before we were trying
just to catch Dom,

1076
01:30:02,882 --> 01:30:04,276
but now after all of this...

1077
01:30:04,277 --> 01:30:07,106
I want you to know,
if I have to...

1078
01:30:07,445 --> 01:30:10,083
I'm gonna put him down..

1079
01:30:11,547 --> 01:30:14,815
Then you might have to
take us both down.

1080
01:30:14,816 --> 01:30:17,958
I'm freezing man.
This ain't for me.

1081
01:30:18,518 --> 01:30:20,886
I come from a different
kind of lifestyle brah.

1082
01:30:22,921 --> 01:30:27,217
Ladies know me.
They know where I'm at with.

1083
01:30:27,656 --> 01:30:32,091
I try to take a piss,
I ain't even recognize myself.

1084
01:30:32,092 --> 01:30:34,458
Now that's entirely too
much information.

1085
01:30:34,459 --> 01:30:35,927
I'm just saying.

1086
01:30:35,928 --> 01:30:37,848
Well, one thing is for sure.

1087
01:30:38,330 --> 01:30:40,783
Dom's gotta be either working
with them or making a train

1088
01:30:40,784 --> 01:30:44,594
cause no one will be this insane
to hit this place without a damn army.

1089
01:30:45,233 --> 01:30:46,859
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

1090
01:30:48,835 --> 01:30:50,140
Speak of the Devil.

1091
01:30:57,840 --> 01:31:01,435
Alright, Dom, you're one step
closer to that family reunion.

1092
01:31:01,436 --> 01:31:02,741
400 meters to base.

1093
01:31:02,776 --> 01:31:05,773
Prep the EMP.
Let's take these defenses down.

1094
01:31:16,963 --> 01:31:18,851
<i>We have a possible
threat incoming.

1095
01:31:18,852 --> 01:31:21,902
<i>Raise the barricade,
As soon as possible.

1096
01:31:38,953 --> 01:31:41,670
<i>We've lost power,
get to your positions now.

1097
01:31:42,965 --> 01:31:45,863
Gates are open.
Let's get this party started.

1098
01:32:01,375 --> 01:32:03,277
- EMP's are charging.
- How long?

1099
01:32:03,278 --> 01:32:04,583
60 seconds.

1100
01:32:05,477 --> 01:32:07,975
Alright, Dom,
You've one pulse left in that EMP.

1101
01:32:08,414 --> 01:32:10,639
That sub is heavily insulated.

1102
01:32:10,640 --> 01:32:13,626
You're gonna need to be right
underneath it, for this thing to work.

1103
01:32:37,357 --> 01:32:38,388
Come on.

1104
01:32:38,389 --> 01:32:41,026
<i>Engaging target.
He's beneath the Sub.

1105
01:32:46,979 --> 01:32:49,980
<i>I'm loosing control, mayday, mayday.
I'm going down.

1106
01:32:56,206 --> 01:32:58,478
Yes, two birds with one stone.

1107
01:32:58,479 --> 01:32:59,807
We've got control of the sub.

1108
01:32:59,808 --> 01:33:01,243
Dom, we are good.

1109
01:33:01,676 --> 01:33:03,778
Head over to the Rendezvous.
Ok Matty...

1110
01:33:03,811 --> 01:33:05,840
Let's take this baby for a spin.

1111
01:33:11,563 --> 01:33:12,611
Damn!

1112
01:33:12,612 --> 01:33:16,079
I think Cipher just rebooted
that Sub's command system.

1113
01:33:16,080 --> 01:33:17,654
What the hell is he talking about?

1114
01:33:17,655 --> 01:33:19,018
In Leyman's terms...

1115
01:33:19,019 --> 01:33:21,416
She just carjacked a submarine.

1116
01:33:22,488 --> 01:33:26,386
We can't let it get away.
There's the control room.

1117
01:33:26,723 --> 01:33:28,468
If you can get me
into that warehouse

1118
01:33:28,492 --> 01:33:30,725
I can tap with network
and counter hack Cipher.

1119
01:33:30,726 --> 01:33:32,125
Keep it from flowing into water.

1120
01:33:32,126 --> 01:33:34,627
No, what we need to do is
get me on that sub.

1121
01:33:34,628 --> 01:33:36,556
I find the weapon's room
and I can pull the lunch chip

1122
01:33:36,557 --> 01:33:38,095
before she can fire
any of those nukes.

1123
01:33:38,096 --> 01:33:39,401
That is too crazy.

1124
01:33:39,631 --> 01:33:41,965
- Just saying it's too dangerous.
- We'll do both.

1125
01:34:06,512 --> 01:34:07,817
Knock, knock!

1126
01:34:12,415 --> 01:34:14,433
Five vehicles just reached the base.

1127
01:34:14,750 --> 01:34:16,733
They just don't give up, do they..

1128
01:34:25,556 --> 01:34:28,351
A'right. Let's haul ass team.
Double time, double time.

1129
01:34:35,896 --> 01:34:37,432
Letty, let's roll.

1130
01:34:39,658 --> 01:34:41,195
Go, go, go, go.

1131
01:35:17,385 --> 01:35:18,448
Change of plans, Dom.

1132
01:35:18,449 --> 01:35:20,981
I'm sending you the co-ordinates,
head there immediately.

1133
01:35:20,982 --> 01:35:24,022
- I'm done. I want my son.
- I'll tell you when you're done.

1134
01:35:24,023 --> 01:35:28,228
Your team is in play, now meet Rhodes
and follow my instruction.

1135
01:35:34,295 --> 01:35:35,959
I got you covered, go.

1136
01:35:38,930 --> 01:35:42,259
Move, move!
Get out of here, go go!

1137
01:35:49,302 --> 01:35:52,389
Ok, how do you like this?

1138
01:35:54,172 --> 01:35:57,257
- Remote link has been separated.
- I'll take care of this.

1139
01:36:01,009 --> 01:36:02,807
Hi Ramsey.

1140
01:36:06,146 --> 01:36:07,700
She's regaining control.

1141
01:36:07,701 --> 01:36:09,239
Damn it, she's good.

1142
01:36:50,238 --> 01:36:52,161
They are entering
the Weapon's room.

1143
01:36:52,162 --> 01:36:53,468
Oh that's cute.

1144
01:36:59,075 --> 01:37:03,155
Go, pull pull!
Roman, guard up by the chip, go.

1145
01:37:06,646 --> 01:37:09,994
Oh she's slick.
Gonna have to do better in that way.

1146
01:37:11,769 --> 01:37:13,995
Ok,
now you're starting to piss me off.

1147
01:37:29,009 --> 01:37:31,431
Ramsey,
how much time we talking to you?

1148
01:37:31,460 --> 01:37:35,395
You're smart,
but no smart enough.

1149
01:37:38,096 --> 01:37:39,477
She's locked me out.

1150
01:37:42,866 --> 01:37:45,634
Tez, I can't stop. Now
you're gonna have to pull that chip.

1151
01:37:45,635 --> 01:37:47,606
I can't.
This thing's going into attack mode.

1152
01:37:47,607 --> 01:37:50,020
The door's not gonna open
until you pull the chip.

1153
01:37:50,971 --> 01:37:54,368
Tez we got no idea what the hell
we are looking for.

1154
01:37:55,140 --> 01:37:56,445
I got it.

1155
01:37:59,275 --> 01:38:02,076
What in the hell are you guys doing?

1156
01:38:02,077 --> 01:38:04,411
It wasn't me, okay?

1157
01:38:04,412 --> 01:38:06,496
It will be labeled
"Guidance Go".

1158
01:38:07,113 --> 01:38:09,047
- Ok. I got something.
- What?

1159
01:38:09,048 --> 01:38:12,636
It says haha.. slack slack back

1160
01:38:12,637 --> 01:38:15,684
smoke, dear jack n jack.

1161
01:38:15,685 --> 01:38:17,287
Do you understand that?

1162
01:38:41,733 --> 01:38:43,650
Well, nasty.

1163
01:38:57,008 --> 01:38:59,177
Quite a show.

1164
01:39:01,643 --> 01:39:03,281
Arming the nuke..

1165
01:39:07,982 --> 01:39:10,362
Nuke's going hot,
she's trying to fire this thing.

1166
01:39:10,363 --> 01:39:12,678
- Roger that, we're moving out.
- Disable the nukes.

1167
01:39:12,679 --> 01:39:13,416
Roman, what are you seeing?

1168
01:39:13,417 --> 01:39:16,003
- Come on, Talk to me.
- I don't see shit. I'm holding on.

1169
01:39:17,387 --> 01:39:18,851
Now we have a countdown.

1170
01:39:22,579 --> 01:39:24,423
What the hell is going on man?

1171
01:39:24,424 --> 01:39:27,357
We are about to launch a nuclear
missile, what the hell is going on.

1172
01:39:27,358 --> 01:39:28,789
Pull the damn chip.

1173
01:39:31,794 --> 01:39:34,328
Countdown. Countdown.
Look for a countdown.

1174
01:39:34,329 --> 01:39:35,329
What countdown?

1175
01:39:35,330 --> 01:39:37,363
The missile needs to
activate for launch.

1176
01:39:37,364 --> 01:39:39,616
The countdown timer
won't be in Russian.

1177
01:39:39,617 --> 01:39:40,503
The countdown.

1178
01:39:40,504 --> 01:39:43,312
Let's show the world
what we've got.

1179
01:39:44,301 --> 01:39:45,799
No. No. No. Don't press that.

1180
01:39:48,604 --> 01:39:49,909
I got it.

1181
01:39:51,372 --> 01:39:53,735
Something is wrong.
It won't launch.

1182
01:39:54,707 --> 01:39:56,736
Get that sub out of there.

1183
01:39:56,974 --> 01:39:58,610
Now!

1184
01:39:59,710 --> 01:40:01,748
Move your ass Roman.

1185
01:40:09,549 --> 01:40:10,415
You alright?

1186
01:40:10,416 --> 01:40:13,508
There's nothing alright
about any of this. Let's go.

1187
01:40:13,509 --> 01:40:14,814
What about the missiles?

1188
01:40:15,685 --> 01:40:17,816
We got the chip,
no nukes for her.

1189
01:40:18,020 --> 01:40:20,622
Hell yeah. Let's roll.

1190
01:40:24,050 --> 01:40:27,348
Guys we got company.
A lot of company.

1191
01:40:31,790 --> 01:40:32,990
Alright team, here is the plan.

1192
01:40:32,991 --> 01:40:35,272
There is a Sea lock
at the opening of the bay,

1193
01:40:35,273 --> 01:40:36,477
We get there first, and close it,

1194
01:40:36,478 --> 01:40:39,247
we can stop the submarine
from escaping into open water.

1195
01:40:39,248 --> 01:40:40,876
And disappearing forever.

1196
01:40:42,380 --> 01:40:45,409
I've got the location.
It's 10 miles south west.

1197
01:40:45,604 --> 01:40:48,248
10 miles?
Like I make it in 10 seconds.

1198
01:40:58,849 --> 01:41:01,587
What's the matter Roman,
you forgot the snow tyre?

1199
01:41:03,319 --> 01:41:05,092
Loving that Lambo now?

1200
01:41:15,187 --> 01:41:17,697
Alright everyone, hold you
with that launch trip later.

1201
01:41:17,698 --> 01:41:18,668
Right now I want that sub,

1202
01:41:18,669 --> 01:41:20,253
in deep water,
where no one can find it.

1203
01:41:20,254 --> 01:41:22,177
Find me the fastest
route out of that bay.

1204
01:41:22,178 --> 01:41:23,483
Copy that.

1205
01:41:32,765 --> 01:41:34,456
Why are they shooting at me?

1206
01:41:34,457 --> 01:41:36,451
I think off you're in that
orange Lamborghini I don't know.

1207
01:41:36,452 --> 01:41:38,543
Shut up Tez.

1208
01:41:43,591 --> 01:41:44,508
Dom.

1209
01:41:44,509 --> 01:41:46,632
Do you really wanna
put that car in gear?

1210
01:41:48,596 --> 01:41:49,901
Do you?

1211
01:41:53,452 --> 01:41:54,939
I don't think so.

1212
01:41:54,940 --> 01:41:56,047
They're heading for the sea lock.

1213
01:41:56,048 --> 01:41:57,505
They're trying to trap
the sub in the bay.

1214
01:41:57,506 --> 01:42:00,156
I should have taken care of this
a long time ago.

1215
01:42:00,551 --> 01:42:03,635
Rhodes, check his team out.

1216
01:42:03,829 --> 01:42:05,139
I'm on it.

1217
01:42:10,683 --> 01:42:12,448
Roman, get in front of me.

1218
01:42:18,957 --> 01:42:20,598
Ok, y'all wanna play it rough?

1219
01:42:21,826 --> 01:42:23,131
Now it's my turn.

1220
01:42:37,041 --> 01:42:38,761
Yeah, baby!

1221
01:42:47,951 --> 01:42:50,523
Guys,
we got snow mobile on the right.

1222
01:42:52,022 --> 01:42:54,120
They're going to flank us.

1223
01:42:57,993 --> 01:43:00,163
No they ain't!

1224
01:43:04,900 --> 01:43:07,105
Oh shit!

1225
01:43:20,381 --> 01:43:21,648
Tez!

1226
01:43:21,649 --> 01:43:23,320
Roman hold tight.
I'm on the way.

1227
01:43:27,655 --> 01:43:31,390
I don't wanna go swimming. No!

1228
01:43:35,896 --> 01:43:38,135
Really Tez?

1229
01:43:39,867 --> 01:43:43,038
Oh, No. No. No.

1230
01:43:46,438 --> 01:43:47,743
Oh shit.

1231
01:43:50,026 --> 01:43:51,368
Roman, grab your door.

1232
01:43:51,369 --> 01:43:52,462
Tez!

1233
01:43:52,463 --> 01:43:53,992
Grab the door Roman.

1234
01:43:53,993 --> 01:43:56,920
It's all gone. Oh Shit.

1235
01:44:08,669 --> 01:44:09,974
Roman, hang on.

1236
01:44:11,134 --> 01:44:12,439
Tej!

1237
01:44:15,969 --> 01:44:17,538
Get me off this thing.

1238
01:44:17,706 --> 01:44:19,065
Tez.

1239
01:44:23,206 --> 01:44:24,511
Come on!

1240
01:44:38,754 --> 01:44:41,463
Alright,
I've had enough of this shit!

1241
01:44:55,289 --> 01:44:57,379
Number 11 my Ass.

1242
01:44:59,506 --> 01:45:02,305
Don't shrink it.
We got a sub to catch, get in.

1243
01:45:16,061 --> 01:45:16,376
What?

1244
01:45:16,377 --> 01:45:18,581
The pressure is on alert
in the cargo hold.

1245
01:45:18,582 --> 01:45:20,068
Drop it to 10 thousand feet.

1246
01:45:20,929 --> 01:45:23,262
I know how much these people
mean to you.

1247
01:45:23,364 --> 01:45:25,675
So I'll let you pick
the first target.

1248
01:45:25,676 --> 01:45:27,781
I'm not picking target
from a mile away.

1249
01:45:29,193 --> 01:45:32,363
I'd stand face to face,
and look 'em dead in the eye.

1250
01:45:33,672 --> 01:45:35,058
Ok.

1251
01:45:35,274 --> 01:45:37,346
The wife it is.

1252
01:45:55,227 --> 01:45:58,784
Nice plane.
I'm gonna enjoy her remains.

1253
01:45:58,896 --> 01:46:00,120
You don't go get any ideas.

1254
01:46:00,121 --> 01:46:02,094
You and planes don't have a good history.

1255
01:46:04,603 --> 01:46:05,908
No shit.

1256
01:46:07,437 --> 01:46:11,186
Let's go scarface.
The arseholes ain't gonna kill themselves.

1257
01:46:14,444 --> 01:46:16,740
Pull up surveillance, right now.

1258
01:46:21,417 --> 01:46:22,848
Surprise.

1259
01:46:24,453 --> 01:46:26,726
Pierce must be dead.

1260
01:46:36,972 --> 01:46:39,588
<i>You're driving.
I said it from the beginning.

1261
01:46:39,589 --> 01:46:41,611
<i>No way, I'm not driving.

1262
01:46:42,570 --> 01:46:46,777
We have a security breach in the
cargo hold. Take care of it now.

1263
01:46:51,545 --> 01:46:54,763
Jesus Mum, you should
pose to avoid the nerves.

1264
01:46:54,764 --> 01:46:56,477
Oh, shut up, don't be such a baby.

1265
01:47:02,757 --> 01:47:04,561
Get to the pilot,
he's got the second key.

1266
01:47:04,562 --> 01:47:05,738
Wait for my signal.

1267
01:47:05,739 --> 01:47:07,421
Give Cipher my regards.

1268
01:47:08,484 --> 01:47:10,568
Did Torretto hold up his end of the deal?

1269
01:47:21,473 --> 01:47:24,641
He gave us this little thing here.

1270
01:47:24,642 --> 01:47:26,510
No, don't touch.

1271
01:47:26,511 --> 01:47:27,998
You can track Cipher with this,

1272
01:47:27,999 --> 01:47:31,325
but you can't do this on your own.
There's gotta be two of you.

1273
01:47:31,326 --> 01:47:33,637
Fine, I got contacts.

1274
01:47:34,486 --> 01:47:36,085
Now you're gonna take your brother.

1275
01:47:36,086 --> 01:47:37,526
- No.
- Yes.

1276
01:47:41,325 --> 01:47:42,790
Torretto knows where he is...

1277
01:47:43,293 --> 01:47:44,178
He's got this thing.

1278
01:47:44,179 --> 01:47:47,430
He can see everything it's like it's
called the devil's bumhole or something?

1279
01:47:47,431 --> 01:47:50,830
- It's called the God's eyes.
- Yeah, well. Whatever.

1280
01:47:51,968 --> 01:47:54,603
There's no way
I'm using Owen, alright?

1281
01:47:54,604 --> 01:47:56,667
He's a lost cause.

1282
01:47:56,740 --> 01:47:58,507
He's your brother, Deck.

1283
01:47:58,508 --> 01:48:02,511
He's my son. He's our family.

1284
01:48:02,512 --> 01:48:04,685
And our family that died...

1285
01:48:05,139 --> 01:48:07,210
Bloody shit happening.

1286
01:48:07,211 --> 01:48:09,427
You lied about, I mean,
I can't believe you.

1287
01:48:09,428 --> 01:48:12,553
You've gotten upset,
you really upset your mother.

1288
01:48:12,554 --> 01:48:14,021
Call yourself a brother?

1289
01:48:14,022 --> 01:48:16,695
Look, I'm in, mum. Ok.

1290
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:19,865
Every time!

1291
01:48:24,565 --> 01:48:26,395
- Owen.
- In position.

1292
01:48:28,750 --> 01:48:30,055
Go.

1293
01:48:30,938 --> 01:48:32,335
I'm in.

1294
01:48:50,590 --> 01:48:52,758
I've got the package to lay on.

1295
01:48:52,759 --> 01:48:54,963
Whole pounds of him..

1296
01:49:15,379 --> 01:49:16,793
You made me miss my son?

1297
01:49:17,415 --> 01:49:19,046
What do you think you're doing?

1298
01:49:21,685 --> 01:49:23,981
Looking at you dead in the eye.

1299
01:49:46,208 --> 01:49:47,563
That was for Letty.

1300
01:49:52,014 --> 01:49:54,931
- Rhodes.
- He is no longer with us.

1301
01:49:55,451 --> 01:49:57,946
Rhodes picked the wrong target.

1302
01:49:58,753 --> 01:50:00,061
Congratulations Dom.

1303
01:50:01,232 --> 01:50:02,537
You just killed your son.

1304
01:50:02,723 --> 01:50:03,757
You are wrong.

1305
01:50:03,758 --> 01:50:05,313
I just saved him.

1306
01:50:06,261 --> 01:50:09,025
And you just took your foot
off the tiger's neck.

1307
01:50:16,703 --> 01:50:20,000
You're welcome.
It's gonna get noisy.

1308
01:50:20,740 --> 01:50:22,910
This is for your relief.

1309
01:50:27,714 --> 01:50:29,019
Good?

1310
01:50:31,483 --> 01:50:32,948
Let's go.

1311
01:50:35,020 --> 01:50:38,927
Go stop him, do not let him
get off this plane.

1312
01:50:42,223 --> 01:50:44,568
That truck's got enough munition
to take us all out.

1313
01:50:44,729 --> 01:50:45,772
We don't give 'em a target.

1314
01:50:45,773 --> 01:50:47,329
Everybody get in
front of us, line up

1315
01:50:47,330 --> 01:50:49,004
- we will take the hit.
- What?

1316
01:50:49,133 --> 01:50:51,066
I need to switch cars, right now.

1317
01:51:07,283 --> 01:51:09,642
- Roman, here comes the bad part.
- What?

1318
01:51:16,025 --> 01:51:18,358
Hang in there guys!
We're almost through the lock.

1319
01:51:18,561 --> 01:51:21,423
It's easy for you to say,
when your ass ain't on fire.

1320
01:51:26,811 --> 01:51:28,413
Alright little mate.

1321
01:51:28,537 --> 01:51:30,002
It's might be a little scary,

1322
01:51:30,699 --> 01:51:32,470
It's gonna be a lot of fun.

1323
01:51:43,585 --> 01:51:45,755
The music good?

1324
01:51:58,599 --> 01:51:59,666
They're locking on.

1325
01:51:59,667 --> 01:52:01,267
Sorry guys,
I got no trick for us..

1326
01:52:01,268 --> 01:52:03,569
- What do we do now?
- We start praying.

1327
01:52:26,592 --> 01:52:27,897
Hell yeah!

1328
01:52:40,038 --> 01:52:41,343
That's Dom!

1329
01:52:45,143 --> 01:52:47,596
- This guy in our side now?
- Who the hell cares?

1330
01:52:47,597 --> 01:52:49,201
He just saved our asses.

1331
01:52:52,349 --> 01:52:54,915
Good to be riding
with you again man.

1332
01:53:07,563 --> 01:53:09,222
Torretto just cleared the way
for them.

1333
01:53:09,223 --> 01:53:10,771
Someone give me something.

1334
01:53:10,772 --> 01:53:12,963
- Torpedoes are ready.
- Then launch them.

1335
01:53:31,219 --> 01:53:32,801
- Take the wheel.
- I ain't taking shit.

1336
01:53:32,802 --> 01:53:36,315
- Take the wheel!
- Where are you doing?

1337
01:53:37,458 --> 01:53:39,921
- This is crazy!
- Speed up,

1338
01:53:42,897 --> 01:53:44,931
- Left and back!
- What?

1339
01:53:44,932 --> 01:53:48,206
Turn the goddamn wheel to the left,
really quickly.

1340
01:53:53,907 --> 01:53:55,338
Boom, baby!

1341
01:54:02,148 --> 01:54:03,453
That's alright!

1342
01:54:09,053 --> 01:54:10,358
Back in the sink.

1343
01:54:24,936 --> 01:54:26,304
Where is that smile?

1344
01:54:26,499 --> 01:54:28,301
There it is!

1345
01:54:33,578 --> 01:54:37,805
You're gonna shoot a baby
You shoud bust it...

1346
01:54:38,915 --> 01:54:40,541
You aren't gonna wanna see this?

1347
01:54:53,529 --> 01:54:54,834
Is that you or him?

1348
01:54:57,766 --> 01:54:59,168
Him. Good.

1349
01:54:59,601 --> 01:55:00,666
The torpedo's missed,

1350
01:55:00,667 --> 01:55:02,852
they are gonna reach lock
before the sub does.

1351
01:55:02,853 --> 01:55:04,903
The hell they are.

1352
01:55:06,942 --> 01:55:08,941
Get ready for this.

1353
01:55:28,595 --> 01:55:29,495
Oh shit!

1354
01:55:29,496 --> 01:55:31,792
We're going to
need a bigger truck.

1355
01:55:56,356 --> 01:55:59,554
- Get us out of here.
- Why are you always yelling?

1356
01:56:03,027 --> 01:56:05,867
- This bitch is crazy!
- Look out!

1357
01:56:11,636 --> 01:56:13,805
That's not good.

1358
01:56:14,471 --> 01:56:16,744
That's not good.

1359
01:56:22,045 --> 01:56:23,713
We got this.

1360
01:56:35,991 --> 01:56:37,830
That's my girl.

1361
01:56:43,532 --> 01:56:44,443
The sub's too close.

1362
01:56:44,444 --> 01:56:46,500
We ain't making it
to the gate in time.

1363
01:56:46,501 --> 01:56:47,935
We just gonna let it get away?

1364
01:56:47,936 --> 01:56:49,536
Not if I know Dom.

1365
01:56:54,442 --> 01:56:55,907
You loose. Dom.

1366
01:56:55,944 --> 01:56:57,943
I destroyed two of your teams.

1367
01:56:58,480 --> 01:57:00,646
I killed your red headed boyfriend.

1368
01:57:00,647 --> 01:57:04,179
And I put two killers on you
untraceable plane.

1369
01:57:05,319 --> 01:57:08,196
You lost the minute
you interrupted my honeymoon.

1370
01:57:10,858 --> 01:57:13,754
Put a heat-seeker on him now.

1371
01:57:15,428 --> 01:57:16,893
Now!

1372
01:57:27,506 --> 01:57:30,302
That's a goddamn heat seeker
coming at us.

1373
01:57:41,018 --> 01:57:44,285
Oh my... come and get it.

1374
01:58:05,040 --> 01:58:07,242
Guys! Dive..

1375
01:58:07,243 --> 01:58:11,279
This... This is for my son!

1376
01:58:29,733 --> 01:58:31,080
Dom!

1377
01:59:33,190 --> 01:59:34,724
You are out of bullets Deckard.

1378
01:59:34,725 --> 01:59:38,298
Like I'm need a gun
to take care of you,

1379
01:59:39,095 --> 01:59:40,424
How did you find me?

1380
01:59:42,131 --> 01:59:46,027
You want to see the old Dom?
Watch!

1381
01:59:49,205 --> 01:59:51,161
Resourceful.

1382
01:59:51,241 --> 01:59:53,248
You have a lot to answer Cipher.

1383
01:59:54,149 --> 01:59:55,854
You pulled my family through.

1384
01:59:56,569 --> 01:59:57,874
A mother.

1385
01:59:59,448 --> 02:00:01,683
I'm gonna make sure
that never happens again.

1386
02:00:01,684 --> 02:00:03,751
To anyone.

1387
02:00:03,752 --> 02:00:06,261
There is only one
flaw in your plan.

1388
02:00:06,262 --> 02:00:07,555
What's that?

1389
02:00:07,556 --> 02:00:09,851
Only one of us has a parachute!

1390
02:00:32,712 --> 02:00:34,551
Told you this would be fun!

1391
02:00:38,151 --> 02:00:40,320
Time to land, Boys!

1392
02:00:50,028 --> 02:00:51,467
You know I've never left you, Letty?

1393
02:00:51,468 --> 02:00:52,773
I know.

1394
02:00:53,298 --> 02:00:55,502
And you know I never will..

1395
02:00:57,201 --> 02:00:58,598
I know.

1396
02:01:07,779 --> 02:01:10,509
I've so much to tell you.

1397
02:01:10,848 --> 02:01:14,230
Yeah you do,
and you can start with that bitch!

1398
02:01:19,022 --> 02:01:23,463
Now, that's... Dominic Toretto.

1399
02:01:24,327 --> 02:01:28,129
Hey Dom!
I'm just towing it out there?

1400
02:01:28,130 --> 02:01:29,740
We need to get up out of here.

1401
02:01:29,761 --> 02:01:33,268
Cause this all kinda neuclearism
happening under this ice.

1402
02:01:33,269 --> 02:01:36,596
Relax! Without the trigger chips,
those nukes are harmless.

1403
02:01:37,006 --> 02:01:38,569
Ok. So we good then.

1404
02:01:38,741 --> 02:01:41,573
Lemme go and get my
young selfie levels up.

1405
02:01:42,277 --> 02:01:44,311
You realize this is classified, right?

1406
02:01:44,312 --> 02:01:46,414
Not today.

1407
02:01:49,117 --> 02:01:51,459
We have to get up out of here man.
I'm freezing.

1408
02:02:19,312 --> 02:02:20,746
It's Okay.

1409
02:02:21,214 --> 02:02:22,959
Don't worry,
he's gonna be here soon.

1410
02:02:23,517 --> 02:02:25,451
I get it, y'all got a lot in common.

1411
02:02:25,452 --> 02:02:28,111
Computer hacks,
god's eyes, geeks, nerd.

1412
02:02:28,112 --> 02:02:30,797
You know, but we got a
lot in common too! Alright?

1413
02:02:30,798 --> 02:02:32,833
- Like what?
- We walk in the room,

1414
02:02:32,924 --> 02:02:35,050
and we are oozing sex appeal.

1415
02:02:35,051 --> 02:02:37,344
Me and you? There's a problem.

1416
02:02:37,345 --> 02:02:39,728
I am asking the real
question right now.

1417
02:02:40,031 --> 02:02:41,613
Is it gonna be...

1418
02:02:42,401 --> 02:02:46,689
the Nerd or... the dark knight?

1419
02:02:47,572 --> 02:02:49,573
To be honest I like both of you.

1420
02:02:49,574 --> 02:02:52,609
A'rigt! Yeah..yea!

1421
02:02:52,610 --> 02:02:55,638
But just before we
get into all of that,

1422
02:02:55,752 --> 02:02:58,050
Let me ask you one question.

1423
02:02:58,051 --> 02:03:00,879
- You can ask me anything.
- Anything.

1424
02:03:00,884 --> 02:03:02,656
What's my last name?

1425
02:03:04,621 --> 02:03:08,701
When you guys pick around with then
I guess you can let me know.

1426
02:03:08,702 --> 02:03:11,702
It's gonna be a Parker.
That's all that really matters.

1427
02:03:11,703 --> 02:03:13,091
Jones, Miss Parker.

1428
02:03:13,240 --> 02:03:15,206
Hey Miss Parker.

1429
02:03:15,854 --> 02:03:17,623
- Hey.
- Hey.

1430
02:03:18,200 --> 02:03:19,839
I wanted to thank you.

1431
02:03:20,302 --> 02:03:21,607
No need.

1432
02:03:24,056 --> 02:03:25,011
Cipher's still on the loose.

1433
02:03:25,012 --> 02:03:26,554
There's been some
reports she's in Athens.

1434
02:03:26,555 --> 02:03:29,243
But she won't be
nuking any city anytime soon.

1435
02:03:29,244 --> 02:03:30,261
Thanks to you guys.

1436
02:03:30,262 --> 02:03:33,878
- So, I got you a parting favor.
- This can't be good...

1437
02:03:34,099 --> 02:03:38,201
Your record's been clreared.
Full re-instatement. You got you job back.

1438
02:03:38,202 --> 02:03:39,980
That is if you want it.

1439
02:03:43,174 --> 02:03:44,602
If I want?

1440
02:03:52,149 --> 02:03:54,445
You know after 16 years.

1441
02:03:55,118 --> 02:03:56,849
I figured it's time
for a little break.

1442
02:03:56,850 --> 02:03:58,155
Wow.

1443
02:03:59,222 --> 02:04:01,495
Daddy's stayin' home.

1444
02:04:08,097 --> 02:04:10,432
- Nobody.
- Get in touch!

1445
02:04:10,433 --> 02:04:12,498
Ah, hang on a second.

1446
02:04:12,535 --> 02:04:14,500
This could be interesting.

1447
02:04:19,308 --> 02:04:21,532
What made you think
I would do it?

1448
02:04:22,110 --> 02:04:25,444
Brother-hood.
I saw that look you gave Cipher.

1449
02:04:25,445 --> 02:04:27,214
I knew you wanted revenge.

1450
02:04:27,215 --> 02:04:28,708
Glad I did it.

1451
02:04:32,120 --> 02:04:34,339
Can't believe you
went to see my Mother.

1452
02:04:44,131 --> 02:04:45,495
Come on.

1453
02:04:50,136 --> 02:04:51,965
All this fuss of you.

1454
02:04:57,977 --> 02:04:59,442
Yes.

1455
02:05:04,483 --> 02:05:07,492
Alena,
I promise to keep our son safe.

1456
02:05:09,726 --> 02:05:11,640
And now.. he always will be.

1457
02:05:20,131 --> 02:05:22,191
I want to introduce
you to the most

1458
02:05:22,192 --> 02:05:24,319
important person in my universe.

1459
02:05:25,636 --> 02:05:28,408
Who will never give up on me.

1460
02:05:36,881 --> 02:05:38,345
You've heard me say.

1461
02:05:38,802 --> 02:05:41,415
"That you never turn
your back on family."

1462
02:05:43,052 --> 02:05:47,487
And I wanna thank you all
for never turning your back on me.

1463
02:05:51,728 --> 02:05:53,526
You wanna meet them?

1464
02:05:54,229 --> 02:05:56,399
Alright!

1465
02:05:56,465 --> 02:05:57,770
Everyone...

1466
02:05:59,083 --> 02:06:00,702
Meet Bryan.

1467
02:06:09,511 --> 02:06:10,919
Hey Bryan.

1468
02:06:13,019 --> 02:06:15,513
Okay,
I guess he's my turning secret.

1469
02:06:16,223 --> 02:06:18,344
<i>Thank you for giving us family.

1470
02:06:21,593 --> 02:06:23,404
<i>Thank you for giving
us the strength.
