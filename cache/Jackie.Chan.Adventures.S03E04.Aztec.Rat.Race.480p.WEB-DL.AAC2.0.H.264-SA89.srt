1
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,742
Tch, if we go any
deeper into Mexico,
we'll hit China.

2
00:00:09,744 --> 00:00:12,444
Jade, on the phone.

3
00:00:12,446 --> 00:00:15,114
Uncle, we have been
hiking for hours

4
00:00:15,116 --> 00:00:17,316
and there is
still no sign.

5
00:00:17,318 --> 00:00:21,120
Are you certain
this cat's whisker
will work?

6
00:00:21,122 --> 00:00:24,523
You do not trust
uncle's locator
spell ingredients?

7
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:27,659
What finds rats?
A cat!

8
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:29,595
One more thing.
Daolon wong

9
00:00:29,597 --> 00:00:31,196
will stop
at nothing to gain

10
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:33,665
the talisman power
within the rat.

11
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:36,268
So, do not
dilly-dally.

12
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,104
But I am not
dilly-dallying.

13
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:41,573
Oh. Must go.
Lunch is ready.

14
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:50,983
Whoa.
Acupuncture city.
(Laughs)

15
00:00:50,985 --> 00:00:54,153
Real acupuncture
is a good thing,
Jade.

16
00:00:54,155 --> 00:00:56,088
It stimulates
the energy channels,

17
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:58,357
and rids
the body of--

18
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:02,795
<i>hola, seor chan.</i>

19
00:01:02,797 --> 00:01:05,164
Bad chi.

20
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,620
Fork over your
rat finder, chan.

21
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:03,922
Come and get it,
superfreaks.

22
00:02:03,924 --> 00:02:06,825
Uh, no, uh, go
and find your own.

23
00:02:06,827 --> 00:02:08,827
Jade, get help.

24
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:10,829
Ohh.

25
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:11,897
Wah!

26
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,206
Agh!

27
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:22,508
Wah!

28
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:26,845
Aah!

29
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:36,355
Unh.

30
00:02:36,357 --> 00:02:37,523
Whoa!

31
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,430
Too bad your niece
won't be showing up

32
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:48,333
with the <i> federales</i>
anytime soon.

33
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,235
Help has arrived,
amigo.

34
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:51,570
All: El toro!

35
00:02:51,572 --> 00:02:52,638
Grr.

36
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,507
(Grunts)

37
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:00,913
Sorry...
Uhh!

38
00:03:00,915 --> 00:03:02,614
Whoa!
Oof.

39
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:07,586
(Yelling)

40
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:09,588
Whoa!

41
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:16,094
We'll be back,
chan!

42
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,530
Antler action!

43
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:21,233
It is fortunate
that Jade located
me and paco.

44
00:03:21,235 --> 00:03:24,369
Yes, El toro--
ugh--quite.

45
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:28,640
So, did you manage to scout
any likely rat habitats?

46
00:03:28,642 --> 00:03:30,709
Just the village
of nueva plata,

47
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:31,877
though there
is rumored to be

48
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:35,280
an abandoned
silver mine nearby.

49
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:36,381
Is not!
Is too!

50
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:37,683
Is not!
Is too!

51
00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:39,318
Hey, children.

52
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,719
Why do
you argue?

53
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:43,255
Paco just can't
accept the fact
that supermoose

54
00:03:43,257 --> 00:03:45,123
is, like, so
totally last year.

55
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,059
Is not!
À <i> El cuernudo</i>
à <i> poderoso</i>

56
00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:49,695
is the greatest
masked hero ever.

57
00:03:49,697 --> 00:03:51,797
The greatest?

58
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:54,766
Uh, that is
a lovely
moose pen, paco,

59
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:56,401
but I think we
can all agree

60
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:57,536
that finding
the rat

61
00:03:57,538 --> 00:03:59,104
before the dark
forces return,

62
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:01,673
is the most
important thing
right now.

63
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:03,575
So totally 90s.

64
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:05,644
So totally not.

65
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,071
Do you hear that?

66
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:42,748
You did not mention
there would be more
than one rat.

67
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,151
Not that I
am bothered.

68
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:49,421
Which is the rat
that we want?

69
00:04:49,423 --> 00:04:50,756
The one
with the power

70
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:53,692
to bring motion
to the motionless,
moose boy.

71
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:57,362
This way!

72
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:14,713
Jackie: It is...

73
00:05:14,715 --> 00:05:16,081
Silver.

74
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:19,518
Excavated from the mine
to build this shrine.

75
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,788
In honor
of quetzalcoatl.

76
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,489
Ko-wetzel-who-zel?

77
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:28,560
The Mayan god of the sun,
sky and agriculture.

78
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:32,964
According to legend,
he was part human
and part plumed serpent.

79
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:34,800
Well, if he's
not part rat,

80
00:05:34,802 --> 00:05:36,735
where is the little--
(Rat squeaks)

81
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:41,573
Aah!

82
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:47,012
Bingo.

83
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:49,715
Nngh-aah!

84
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:53,919
Cute little varmint,
isn't he?

85
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:55,053
(Kisses)

86
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:59,124
(Choking)
Ew! Yech.

87
00:05:59,126 --> 00:06:00,525
Did it hurt you?

88
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:04,629
Uh, no. It, uh,
merely took me
by surprise, paco.

89
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:06,598
I will catch him.

90
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,266
Brr-argh!

91
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:13,472
No! If you startle the rat,
you could activate its--

92
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,477
power.

93
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:20,946
Sorry.

94
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:39,231
Who dares trespass
in my lair?

95
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:41,433
The talisman power?

96
00:06:41,435 --> 00:06:43,969
Motion to
the motionless.

97
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:46,938
Well?

98
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,974
Uh, we are not
trespassers,

99
00:06:48,976 --> 00:06:51,710
your lordship, sir.
Uh, we are, uh--

100
00:06:51,712 --> 00:06:53,712
(rat squeaking)

101
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,047
Gotcha!

102
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:57,816
Uh, pest control.

103
00:06:57,818 --> 00:07:00,819
Uh, yes, uh, a deity
such as yourself

104
00:07:00,821 --> 00:07:04,389
can not have
rats in his lair.
Most unbecoming.

105
00:07:04,391 --> 00:07:06,691
Cihuacoatl.

106
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:08,226
It looks more
like a Mickey,

107
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:10,095
but you can name him
whatever you want.

108
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:14,199
That creature's name
is of no concern
to me, Princess.

109
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,704
Quetzalcoatl
thinks Jade...

110
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:22,140
Is the Mayan goddess
of the earth!

111
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:23,408
Uh...

112
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,977
I sort of see
a resemblance,
but come on.

113
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:28,413
My do's way
sassier than hers.

114
00:07:28,415 --> 00:07:31,983
I see you have not
lost your sense of
humor, cihuacoatl.

115
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:35,620
Come. Let us
at last complete
our journey.

116
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,389
Uh, what journey?

117
00:07:37,391 --> 00:07:40,659
We must fly together
into the sun.

118
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:43,728
Heh heh.

119
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,267
Heh heh.

120
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:50,435
I don't suppose
you'd believe

121
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:53,438
you're really just
a statue, would you?

122
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,440
Let us fly
into the sun,

123
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:56,975
so that our
combined magic

124
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,777
will rain
upon the earth

125
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:02,514
and protect the land
from the forces
of darkness.

126
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:04,549
The statue
can do that?

127
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:06,585
I do not want
to wait and find out.

128
00:08:06,587 --> 00:08:08,587
You will
not have to.

129
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:11,656
Princess,
the sun awaits.

130
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:14,559
Heh. You got it.
Let me just run out

131
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:16,728
for some
tanning butter.
Ooh.

132
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,597
Who dares?

133
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:19,798
Xolotl.

134
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,834
You are talking
to me?

135
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,808
Oh. Quetzalcoatl
thinks El toro

136
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:32,277
is the god
of the underworld!

137
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,083
You Bear
the horned feet.

138
00:08:38,085 --> 00:08:39,885
You are xolotl's
messenger.

139
00:08:39,887 --> 00:08:41,620
But they
are antlers.

140
00:08:41,622 --> 00:08:43,154
El toro: Wait!

141
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:45,490
He is not--
I am not--

142
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:46,858
ohh!

143
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,827
You will not
take cihuacoatl
to the underworld

144
00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:50,729
while I am here
to defend her.

145
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:51,930
Aah!

146
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:53,365
Oof!

147
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:54,533
(Groans)

148
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:57,369
El toro,
are you ok?

149
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:59,037
Of course, paco.

150
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:09,481
The statue can
shoot fire
from his hands?

151
00:09:09,483 --> 00:09:11,750
God of
the sun, duh.

152
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:16,855
Chan had a masked
crime fighter with him,
your wongship.

153
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:18,924
The sun was in our eyes!

154
00:09:18,926 --> 00:09:21,026
We need bigger
weapons!

155
00:09:21,028 --> 00:09:23,628
Excuses, excuses!
I see that if I wish

156
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:28,366
this task accomplished,
I must do it myself.

157
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:31,603
Oof!
Ooh.

158
00:09:31,605 --> 00:09:33,705
That's cool.
We'll wait here,

159
00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:36,341
rest up,
order some chi pizza.

160
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:40,078
Humph. You 3
shall accompany me
and watch!

161
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,914
Perhaps you
will learn something.

162
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:50,855
Uh, perhaps quetzalcoatl
would not be so angry

163
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:53,825
if you prove to him
you are not, you know...

164
00:09:53,827 --> 00:09:56,861
El toro fuerte never
removes his mask.

165
00:09:56,863 --> 00:09:59,864
Unhand the Princess,
or face my wrath.

166
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:02,033
Uh, maybe you should
make an exception.

167
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:03,168
Go, go, go!

168
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:10,842
The statue
can fly, too?

169
00:10:10,844 --> 00:10:12,844
God of
the sky, duh.

170
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:15,880
Jackie: In here.

171
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:17,549
Quetzalcoatl: Aargh!

172
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:21,920
Jade: Hi-yo,
silver mine.

173
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:28,560
In you go!

174
00:10:28,562 --> 00:10:29,761
Hang on tight!

175
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:31,863
(Grunting)

176
00:10:31,865 --> 00:10:33,098
Please keep your
paws and whiskers

177
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,300
inside the vehicle
at all times.

178
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:37,402
(Rumbling)

179
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:38,536
(Grunting)

180
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:48,346
The underworld?
No!

181
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:56,354
Bad day.
<i>Muy</i> bad.

182
00:10:56,356 --> 00:10:57,522
Aah!

183
00:10:57,524 --> 00:10:58,723
(Cell phone rings)

184
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:02,460
Hello? Uncle?
Now is not
a good time.

185
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:07,666
What is more
important than
talking to uncle?

186
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:09,167
Jackie: I am in
a speeding mining car,

187
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,703
fleeing a reanimated
Mayan statue,

188
00:11:11,705 --> 00:11:14,839
trying to seize Jade
so he can fly her
into the sun!

189
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,975
Why did you
not say so?

190
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:19,411
It seems you have
found the rat.

191
00:11:19,413 --> 00:11:21,112
Yes.

192
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:22,881
If the living statue
touches the rat
again,

193
00:11:22,883 --> 00:11:26,518
he will return to
his original form.

194
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,287
I do not think he
is in the mood
to do us any favors.

195
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:30,488
Unh!

196
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,557
Uncle: One more
thing...

197
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,699
(Scream)

198
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:43,835
Whoa!
Oof.

199
00:11:43,837 --> 00:11:48,907
(Groans)

200
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:51,009
Whee. Can we
ride again?

201
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:58,550
Flee no more,
xolotl.

202
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:14,199
The statue can grow
unbreakable vines?

203
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:17,435
I know,
agriculture, duh.

204
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:21,806
Where are your
dark powers now,
xolotl?

205
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:23,608
Hello...

206
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:26,010
Wake up and smell the
chimichangas, wingding.

207
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:29,814
"A," he's not--uh,
whoever you think he is.

208
00:12:29,816 --> 00:12:32,317
2, you're really
a statue.

209
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:35,587
And "b," I may have
an incredibly cool coif,

210
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:37,756
but I'm not
a Mayan goddess.

211
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:41,359
Hmm. Clearly
xolotl has clouded
your mind

212
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:43,962
with his dark magic.

213
00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:48,666
Grr...
I mean, yes.

214
00:12:48,668 --> 00:12:50,668
And now that you've
imprisoned him,

215
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:54,506
the fog has lifted,
oh, mighty lizard-head-guy.

216
00:12:54,508 --> 00:12:56,074
Now do your
favorite goddess
a favor

217
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:59,544
and pet
the pretty rat.

218
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:04,549
An odd request,
but as you wish.

219
00:13:04,551 --> 00:13:06,217
Daolon wong: Ahh!

220
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:09,287
I see my work
has already
been done for me.

221
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,897
I will take
the rat.

222
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:31,609
The rat is mine.
And, like the rat,

223
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:33,845
my enemies
have been caged.

224
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:37,615
Apparently by this
able-bodied warrior.

225
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:39,617
Yeah, right,
uh, maybe
giant lizard guy

226
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:41,052
has better
powers than us.

227
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:42,220
Ever think
of that?

228
00:13:42,222 --> 00:13:44,522
Yeah.
Excuses!

229
00:13:44,524 --> 00:13:46,024
Who are
the interlopers?

230
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:47,392
They're evil
to the Max.

231
00:13:47,394 --> 00:13:49,060
don't let them
rip off the rat.

232
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:54,532
Uh, I mean, it would please
your most trusty goddess

233
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:58,536
to not let the true villains
escape, o great flying one.

234
00:13:58,538 --> 00:14:02,240
But it is he
who bears the symbol
of the horned one.

235
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,983
Paco, give me
your pen.

236
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:13,418
Huh?

237
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:15,587
Let us depart.

238
00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:16,721
Oomph!
(Squeaking)

239
00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:18,623
Oh! What?

240
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,658
Be gone, brat!

241
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,462
Oh!

242
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:27,899
You just
stand there?

243
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:30,301
Hey, watch
and learn,
remember?

244
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:33,238
Look, oh lord
of sunlight,

245
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,207
he is truly the god
of the underworld.

246
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,412
You, there!

247
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:48,319
Your power of light
is no match
for the blackest chi.

248
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:53,791
Dark magic.

249
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:56,327
So, you are
truly xolotl.

250
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:58,429
But then, you...

251
00:14:58,431 --> 00:14:59,530
Uh...

252
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,333
Talk later!

253
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:03,501
Princess!

254
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:10,008
See? The first
lesson of battle:
Surprise the enemy.

255
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,242
Surprise!

256
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,411
What? Stop her!

257
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,780
Little girl?
We can handle that.

258

Adios.

263
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,409
Ooh. Where's a mouse hole
when you need one?

264
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:49,948
Give me that!

265
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,150
Hi. We're
your new neighbors.

266
00:15:52,152 --> 00:15:54,919
Can we borrow
a cup of rat?

267
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,791
<i>Eh, cuernudo?</i>

268
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:07,832

helping of moose?

00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:42,547
Quetzalcoatl
bids you farewell.

330
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:51,656
I think quetzalcoatl
is <i> muy excelente.</i>

331
00:19:51,658 --> 00:19:54,125
Almost as <i> excelente</i>
as you, El toro.

332
00:19:54,127 --> 00:19:55,793
You saved us all.

333
00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:59,163
Him and <i> El</i>
- à <i> cuernudo poderoso.</i>

334
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,633
Some toys never go
out of style.

335
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:03,734
(Rat squeaks)

336
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:06,504
Jade, I think
it is feeding time.

337
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:09,840
Want to do
the honors?

338
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:15,046
Uh, <i> si.</i>

339
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,585
Jade: I think
it likes you,
seor fuerte!

340
00:20:20,587 --> 00:20:21,953
Cute!

341
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,228
Hey, Jackie!
Yes?

342
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:32,296
Have you done
any extreme sports?

343
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:34,332
When I'm filming everyday,
I always do

344
00:20:34,334 --> 00:20:35,766
the dangerous things,
the dangerous things.

345
00:20:35,768 --> 00:20:38,636
Then when I get hurt,
you can see it
on the screen.

346
00:20:38,638 --> 00:20:39,837
Some of my friends,

347
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:41,372
they went skiing.

348
00:20:41,374 --> 00:20:44,442
Coming back,
one broken leg,

349
00:20:44,444 --> 00:20:45,843
one broken arm.

350
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:48,579
When on holiday, I never
do these kinds of things.

351
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:51,148
On the screening,
I do everything.
