00:00:00,918 --> 00:00:02,002
<i>- My name is Barry Allen,</i>

2
00:00:02,043 --> 00:00:04,171
<i>and I am
the fastest man alive.</i>

3
00:00:04,212 --> 00:00:05,422
<i>To the outside world,</i>

4
00:00:05,464 --> 00:00:07,508
<i>I'm an ordinary
forensic scientist,</i>

5
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:10,218
<i>but secretly, with the help of
my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

6
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,054
<i>I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.</i>

7
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:15,474
<i>But when my daughter came back
from the future to help,</i>

8
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:17,935
<i>she changed the present,</i>

9
00:00:17,977 --> 00:00:20,521
<i>and now our world is
more dangerous than ever,</i>

10
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:22,898
<i>and I'm the only one
fast enough to save it.</i>

11
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:26,276
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

12
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:28,779
<i>- Previously on "The Flash"...</i>
- I'll deliver it myself.

13
00:00:28,821 --> 00:00:30,906
<i>- That is Eobard Thawne,
the Reverse Flash.</i>

14
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:32,574
He killed my mother.
- I didn't know that.

15
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:34,159
- My life is a million times
better

16
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:35,870
and it's all because of you,
Gracie.

17
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:40,833
<i>- She may never wake.</i>

18
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:45,838
- Every meta will die.

19
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,007
- This is a DNA sample
from Cicada.

20
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:50,009
- We can make
a meta-human cure.

21
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:52,386
- What if the key to defeating
him is appealing to his heart?

22
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:54,555
- How do we do that?
- By saving his child.

23
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:56,724
<i>We need to wake up Grace.</i>

24
00:00:58,517 --> 00:00:59,977
<i>- I want you to think about</i>

25
00:01:00,019 --> 00:01:01,896
<i>the biggest secret
in your life.</i>

26
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:04,899
The one you keep from
the people that you love

27
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,192
or even from yourself.

28
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:09,110
I want you to imagine
what would happen

29
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:12,072
if that secret got out.

30
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:14,658
Remember when you asked
me that?

31
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,828
<i>I've been using all of
your training.</i>

32
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:21,874
<i>Studying my pulse,
managing micro-expressions,</i>

33
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:23,709
<i>limiting non-congruent
gestures,</i>

34
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:26,962
<i>destroying any piece
of evidence.</i>

35
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:31,299
<i>I don't know how much longer
I can keep this up.</i>

36
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,594
<i>And not just because of
the risks.</i>

37
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:35,930
[indistinct chatter]

38
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:40,017
<i>But because the closer
I get to my parents,</i>

39
00:01:40,059 --> 00:01:43,645
the more I feel like
I'm hurting them.

40
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:45,480
Data entry complete, Gideon.

41
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,775
<i>- Thank you, Nora West-Allen.</i>

42
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:50,861
<i>Shall I send this
to the usual recipient?</i>

43
00:01:50,903 --> 00:01:52,487
- Yes.

44
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,698
Send it to Eobard Thawne,

45
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,325
priority level urgent.

46
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,954
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

47
00:02:03,082 --> 00:02:04,374
- You ready for this?

48
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,126
- Dad, I'm just...I'm not
fast enough yet.

49
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:08,837
- No backing out now, this is
the biggest race of your life.

50
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,673
Get ready, set, go!
- Not really. Dad, Dad...

51
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:14,802
Wait, wait!
Oh, God.

52
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,053
[yelps]

53
00:02:16,095 --> 00:02:18,179

54
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:19,974
Gotcha.

55
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:21,850
- This is so embarrassing.

56
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:26,647
I'm really good at the ice
skating game on my Pocket Pal!

57
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,065
- Okay, you're just gonna bend
your knees...

58
00:02:28,107 --> 00:02:29,775
- Kay.
- And lead forward a little.

59
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:31,151
Just, yeah.

60
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:32,193
- [gasps]
- Yeah.

61
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:33,445
- I'm doing it.
- You're doing it.

62
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:36,281
- I'm skating.
This is like schway city, Mom.

63
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:37,783
Thanks.

64
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:39,827
[laughs]

65
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:43,538
- Look at you guys.

66
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,041
Such a mom.
- What? What about you?

67
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:48,877
You're the one who sprang
for ice skating and game night.

68
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:51,379
- Yeah, well,
I know when Nora got hurt,

69
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,632
I got a little frustrated.

70
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:56,969
And now, I mean, we have
an actual plan to stop Cicada.

71
00:02:57,011 --> 00:03:00,097
- Waking up his niece to appeal
to his heart.

72
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:03,224
- I know Dwyer's a killer,
but he's still a person,

73
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:05,602
and he loves Grace
just like we love Nora.

74
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:06,854
So I don't know.
I just feel like

75
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,438
everything's heading
in the right direction.

76
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,107
- Here I come. Coming in.
Here we go.

77
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:11,608
- I'm sorry,
why are you wearing a helmet?

78
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,401
I thought you were made
of rubber.

79
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,236
- Somebody's gotta set a good
example for these kids.

80
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:17,238
- Well...I thought you grew up
on the ice.

81
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,657
- Well, I did, basically,

82
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:21,326
my mom dated a zamboni
operator, so...

83
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:24,663
- And I tell you where I'm from
we don't date zamboni drivers.

84
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,498
Why is that?
Because there are no zambonis.

85
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,375
How do we clear the ice?
All winter long,

86
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,209
we are on our hands and knees
with a squeegee in hand.

87
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:31,753
Let me tell you.

88
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:33,463
Best eight months of
the year for this guy.

89
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:34,965
- It's a really great story,
Sherlock.

90
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:36,383
- Sherloque.

91
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:37,885
- You know,
speaking of squeegeeing,

92
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,469
you know who could use
a good squeegeeing

93
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:42,430
is Larry Blumenthal.
He's dead.

94
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,558
- Larry Blumenthal is dead?
- Yeah.

95
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,643
- The patent registrar across
the hall from you

96
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:48,520
with the 400 square footage...

97
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:51,065
both: And the courtyard views?
- Yeah, dead as a doornail.

98
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:52,941
You can have that place
if you want it. Yours to rent.

99
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:54,568
- What? Oh, my God.
This is perfect.

100
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,778
I mean, my ad revenue has been
up this quarter, so...

101
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,530
- Yeah, with the extra space
you'd be able to hire

102
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,365
editors, photographers.

103
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:03,577
- I could turn my blog into
a real newspaper.

104
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:05,620
- Oh, my package has arrived.

105
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,330
- What package?

106
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,583
- This is the solution
to all our problems.

107
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:12,335
<i>Allez, les amis.</i>
We must go.

<i>La Machine à Mémoire,</i>

111
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:20,594
or as they say in Amérique,
you know...

112
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,345
- The Memory Machine.

113
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,723
Oui, Iris. Memory Machine.
Many times...

114
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:27,142
I have entered into
people's minds

115
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:28,977
using this very technology.

116
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:30,896
From the unfortunate
comatose victims

117

of the Summerholt Institute
to, yes,

118
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:34,357
Jervis Tetch himself,

119
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,860
the Terrible Mad Hatter Killer
from Earth-221.

120
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:39,821
- I come back from Tannhauser
for one second,

121
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:42,991
just borrowing a splicer
for the meta cure

122
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:44,576
and what do I find?

123
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,578
This, this...
- <i>Machine à Mémoire.</i>

124
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,831
- Whatever. How did you even
get this here from Earth-221?

125
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:52,292
- Well, I used the Forerunner
Multiversal Delivery Service.

126
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,335
You don't use it? You don't
have a gold card like me?

127
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,421
Maybe I'll get you a discount.
- We don't need a discount.

128
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,339
All right,
we just need to wake up Grace.

129
00:04:58,381 --> 00:04:59,716
This'll wake her up, right?

130
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:01,927
- So in most coma patients,

131
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:03,845
high traffic areas
of brain activity

132
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:07,348
go dormant and the low traffic
areas spring to life,

133
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,810
but unfortunately,
Grace isn't normal.

134
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:12,229
Not only has her coma lasted
longer than the average,

135
00:05:12,271 --> 00:05:14,606
but her consciousness
has isolated itself

136
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,566
into one specific region,

137
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:18,235
her long-term memories.

138
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:20,195
- It will be so facile,
easy peasy for you.

139
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:24,616
All you do is you transmit
your brainwaves

140
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,285
into Grace's memories, right?

141
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,453
And then you'll lead
her consciousness

142
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,914
out of a neural nexus portal.

143
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:33,374
[snaps fingers]
And Grace awakens.

144
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,002
- It's sort of like when
Barry woke me up

145
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,670
when the Thinker trapped me.

146
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:39,006
- Surprisingly, that sounds
kind of easy peasy.

147
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,967
- As long as Grace's
unusual brain damage

148
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:44,261
doesn't cause any
unforeseen risks.

149
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:45,804
- This is why I suggest
you travel in pairs

150
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:47,346
when you're using
this technology.

151
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:49,933
Every time I enter into
someone's memories

152
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:52,477
when I use this I went
with my partner for sure.

153
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:55,063
- Your partner's name didn't
happen to be Watson, did it?

154
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:56,273
- [scoffs]

155
00:05:56,315 --> 00:05:58,650
- No, his name was not Watson.

156
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:01,069
