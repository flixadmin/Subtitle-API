1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,611
Previously on "Legends of Tomorrow"...

2
00:00:03,047 --> 00:00:05,114
Neron must be looking for a new vessel.

3
00:00:05,149 --> 00:00:06,882
Nora!

4
00:00:09,287 --> 00:00:10,287
Nora?

5
00:00:10,321 --> 00:00:12,601
I don't like Nate. That
would be wrong and...

6
00:00:12,626 --> 00:00:13,640
He likes you.

7
00:00:13,665 --> 00:00:16,340
Why don't you talk to Nate,
tell him how you feel?

8
00:00:16,365 --> 00:00:18,664
Mick's writing a Sci-fi romance novel.

9
00:00:18,689 --> 00:00:20,805
- Rebecca Silver?
- Nom De plume.

10
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,330
Nearly cost her own life,

11
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:23,820
but she killed that bloody demon.

12
00:00:39,073 --> 00:00:41,197
You're letting the cold in, man.

13
00:00:41,222 --> 00:00:43,126
We found something, Sir.

14
00:00:43,151 --> 00:00:45,418
But it's hard to explain.

15
00:00:45,443 --> 00:00:48,110
Don't stand there like
a fool, spit it out.

16
00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:50,592
Something was encased in the ice,

17
00:00:50,627 --> 00:00:52,928
- and it appears to be...
- Gold.

18
00:00:52,963 --> 00:00:54,862
Well, careful, Sir.

19
00:00:58,034 --> 00:01:01,542
It's... incredible.

20
00:01:01,567 --> 00:01:03,768
I haven't the foggiest what it is.

21
00:01:03,793 --> 00:01:05,409
I know exactly what it is.

22
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,737
My greatest discovery.

23
00:01:14,498 --> 00:01:16,598
Yeah, that's what they all say.

24
00:01:17,801 --> 00:01:20,168
Oh, hey, ladies. Is he any trouble?

25
00:01:20,204 --> 00:01:22,037
Slam dunk.

26
00:01:22,072 --> 00:01:23,271
Honestly, with Neron gone,

27
00:01:23,307 --> 00:01:25,207
catching fugitives
has never been easier.

28
00:01:25,242 --> 00:01:26,485
I thought it was gonna take all week.

29
00:01:26,509 --> 00:01:27,674
That's great.

30
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:28,954
It means you won't have
to miss book club tonight.

31
00:01:28,978 --> 00:01:30,378
That's right...

32
00:01:30,413 --> 00:01:31,745
- Mm-hmm.
- Book club.

33
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:34,415
Whoa, smells like
somebody hasn't showered

34
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:36,450
since birds were letters.

35
00:01:36,486 --> 00:01:38,119
That's a hieroglyphics joke.

36
00:01:38,154 --> 00:01:40,388
Ha, nice.

37
00:01:40,423 --> 00:01:42,823
Whoa, buddy, don't talk
with your mouth full,

38
00:01:42,858 --> 00:01:44,145
am I right?

39
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:45,692
Mummy's are the biggest dummies.

40
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:47,194
Hey, you big dummy, mummy,

41
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:49,296
got your containment cell all set up,

42
00:01:49,332 --> 00:01:52,799
and we upgraded you to
a king-size sarcophagus.

43
00:01:52,835 --> 00:01:54,868
Oh, and would you like a wake-up call

44
00:01:54,904 --> 00:01:55,936
from the front desk in,

45
00:01:55,971 --> 00:01:57,115
I don't know, about a thousand years?

46
00:01:57,139 --> 00:01:59,072
Nice.

47
00:01:59,107 --> 00:02:01,708
All right, cool.

48
00:02:01,744 --> 00:02:03,510
- Bye.
- Bye.

49
00:02:09,255 --> 00:02:10,786
I mean, what the hell was that?

50
00:02:11,987 --> 00:02:14,021
- On it.
- Yeah.

51
00:02:15,257 --> 00:02:18,825
Z, how's it going?

52
00:02:18,861 --> 00:02:20,493
It's going super awesome.

53
00:02:20,529 --> 00:02:21,938
How are you and Nate?

54
00:02:23,065 --> 00:02:25,465
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Good.

55
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,133
Ah, Nate Dog?

56
00:02:27,169 --> 00:02:30,303
It's, uh, it's going totally great,

57
00:02:30,338 --> 00:02:32,105
in a super platonic way.

58
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,541
Then why you guys being so weird?

59
00:02:34,576 --> 00:02:36,309
It was that awkward, huh?

60
00:02:36,344 --> 00:02:38,244
Even the mummy thought it was awkward.

61
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,046
Look, I mean, you like him, right?

62
00:02:40,082 --> 00:02:42,748
Yeah, I think so, but I don't know

63
00:02:42,784 --> 00:02:43,861
what the next step would be.

64
00:02:43,885 --> 00:02:46,052
Oh, that's easy. You
just jump his bones.

65
00:02:46,088 --> 00:02:48,588
What if I do that and it
screws up our friendship?

66
00:02:48,623 --> 00:02:52,725
Look, Z, sometimes for the
good of the relationship,

67
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,995
you have to put yourself
outside of your comfort zone.

68
00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:00,199
For instance, I am going to read

69
00:03:00,234 --> 00:03:04,837
500 pages of some trashy
novel by tonight for Ava.

70
00:03:04,862 --> 00:03:06,787
And look, with Neron gone,
now's the time for us

71
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:08,830
to get our personal lives into order.

72
00:03:09,811 --> 00:03:11,143
I will help you.

73
00:03:11,178 --> 00:03:12,411
Please don't.

74
00:03:12,446 --> 00:03:16,415
Relationship expert.

75
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:20,799
"I showed him my locket, explaining,

76
00:03:20,922 --> 00:03:24,090
I keep the ones I love
in here, close to my heart."

77
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:27,226
Gustavo replied, "I
keep the ones I love

78
00:03:27,261 --> 00:03:30,529
in my freezer, close to my microwave."

79
00:03:30,564 --> 00:03:32,397
"He had a devilish sense of humor

80
00:03:32,433 --> 00:03:33,999
that I found irresistible."

81
00:03:34,034 --> 00:03:35,300
Hey, Ray.

82
00:03:35,336 --> 00:03:37,436
I was just reading our
book club book to Nora.

83
00:03:37,471 --> 00:03:39,638
Oh, that's really nice, Mona.

84
00:03:39,673 --> 00:03:41,106
Ray, are you okay?

85
00:03:41,142 --> 00:03:43,142
You look like you haven't slept in days.

86
00:03:43,177 --> 00:03:45,277
Oh, yeah, I've been having weird dreams.

87
00:03:45,312 --> 00:03:46,393
How is she?

88
00:03:46,418 --> 00:03:48,863
No improvements, but no setbacks.

89
00:03:48,888 --> 00:03:50,288
Any news from Constantine?

90
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:51,479
Nothing yet.

91
00:03:51,685 --> 00:03:54,628
Well, I'm sure he'll find
a way to bring her back.

92
00:03:54,653 --> 00:03:56,453
I'll leave you two alone.

93
00:03:59,059 --> 00:04:01,593
I brought you some more flowers,

94
00:04:01,629 --> 00:04:04,846
because when you do wake up,

95
00:04:04,871 --> 00:04:06,603
I want you to know that

96
00:04:06,628 --> 00:04:09,262
your life is gonna be
beautiful from now on.

97
00:04:12,372 --> 00:04:14,305
What the hell?

98
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:20,378
What's happening?

99
00:04:21,314 --> 00:04:23,950
Ray, what are you...

100
00:04:23,975 --> 00:04:25,583
What are you doing with the pillow?

101
00:04:25,618 --> 00:04:26,962
You smothering... you're smothering her?

102
00:04:26,986 --> 00:04:31,489
What are you...

103
00:04:38,231 --> 00:04:42,699
Not groovy. Not groovy at all.

104
00:04:44,578 --> 00:04:47,928
- Synced and corrected by<font color="#00BFFF"> Firefly</font> -
- <font color="#00FFFF"> www.addic7ed.com</font> -

105
00:04:52,377 --> 00:04:54,143
What just happened?

106
00:04:54,179 --> 00:04:55,579
What are you doing?

107
00:04:55,614 --> 00:04:58,181
Why did you try to smother Nora?

108
00:04:58,217 --> 00:04:59,382
Are you losing it, Ray?

109
00:04:59,418 --> 00:05:01,618
Oh, I don't think you're crazy, Ray.

110
00:05:01,653 --> 00:05:06,523
Let's chat, just Ray and Neron.

111
00:05:06,558 --> 00:05:07,990
Neron?

112
00:05:08,026 --> 00:05:10,827
No, no, you're...
you're dead. You're dead.

113
00:05:10,862 --> 00:05:12,494
This... this isn't real.
This isn't real.

114
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:14,385
Not real?

115
00:05:22,172 --> 00:05:24,206
This is... this is all in my head.

116
00:05:24,242 --> 00:05:26,275
This is... this is all in my head. Okay?

117
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,436
Ray.

118
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:29,478
Oh, wow, this place is a mess.

119
00:05:29,513 --> 00:05:33,249
Uh, hey, um, Containment Level bathroom

120
00:05:33,284 --> 00:05:34,816
is sort of my crying spot...

121
00:05:34,852 --> 00:05:37,386
- Not now, Gary!
- Okay. Okay.

122
00:05:44,495 --> 00:05:47,229
You're a reasonable man, Ray Palmer.

123
00:05:47,265 --> 00:05:50,181
So I'm going to make
you a reasonable offer.

124
00:05:50,206 --> 00:05:52,473
Give yourself to me freely.

125
00:05:52,736 --> 00:05:55,203
No. No, this conversation is over.

126
00:06:02,379 --> 00:06:03,945
You leave me no choice

127
00:06:03,981 --> 00:06:06,481
but to make you kill someone you love.

128
00:06:06,516 --> 00:06:08,515
You... you made me

129
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:11,341
try to kill Nora, but why?

130
00:06:11,521 --> 00:06:14,411
Because if you murder someone you love,

131
00:06:14,436 --> 00:06:15,965
your soul will be mine.

132
00:06:21,765 --> 00:06:25,132
What is happening?

133
00:06:30,173 --> 00:06:32,573
- Oi, Mick, fancy a brew?
- Laundry.

134
00:06:33,654 --> 00:06:35,643
Oh, sorry, sorry.

135
00:06:35,679 --> 00:06:37,545
I'll be in the Science doing lab.

136
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,447
Nobody bother me or my hand.

137
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:40,748
Haircut!

138
00:06:40,784 --> 00:06:42,450
What's all this ruckus?

139
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,051
- Hey.
- Hey, I got it.

140
00:06:44,086 --> 00:06:46,454
Is this fan mail for Rebecca Silver?

141
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:47,888
No, it is not.

142
00:06:47,924 --> 00:06:49,691
- Here, give me that!
- What...

143
00:06:51,361 --> 00:06:53,478
"An invitation for
Rebecca Silver to reveal

144
00:06:53,503 --> 00:06:57,698
her identity at Romanti-Con
2019 for $20,000."

145
00:06:57,733 --> 00:06:59,098
Rebecca doesn't do Cons.

146
00:06:59,134 --> 00:07:01,206
Now, Mick, I realize that
you don't like people knowing

147
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:03,146
that you moonlight as a
romance novelist, but...

148
00:07:03,171 --> 00:07:04,904
Do I look like a
romance novelist to you?

149
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,640
Oi, listen, don't you get mad at me.

150
00:07:06,675 --> 00:07:09,976
Now this is an easy score,
and we're gonna get that money.

151
00:07:10,011 --> 00:07:14,047
20K. How?

152
00:07:14,082 --> 00:07:16,616
Well I'll be Rebecca, mate.

153
00:07:18,627 --> 00:07:22,094
Okay. Page one...

154
00:07:25,561 --> 00:07:27,461
Will have to wait.

155
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:33,867
All right, people, we've got a hit.

156
00:07:33,902 --> 00:07:35,268
New York City, 1933,

157
00:07:35,303 --> 00:07:36,702
the Adventurers' Society.

158
00:07:36,738 --> 00:07:37,949
Shut the front door.

159
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,354
What's the Adventurers' Society?

160
00:07:39,379 --> 00:07:42,096
It's a club for
archaeologists and explorers.

161
00:07:42,121 --> 00:07:44,582
It's basically the coolest
place in history.

162
00:07:44,606 --> 00:07:46,160
Guys, this is gonna be awesome.

163
00:07:46,184 --> 00:07:50,160
Nate, you're running point
on this one... with Zari.

164
00:07:50,185 --> 00:07:51,277
For real?

165
00:07:51,302 --> 00:07:52,369
Um...

166
00:07:54,555 --> 00:07:56,022
Sara, we did not discuss this.

167
00:07:56,057 --> 00:07:58,024
Look, relax, it's just a clean-up job.

168
00:07:58,059 --> 00:08:00,459
They'll do fine.

169
00:08:00,495 --> 00:08:02,628
Okay, find the fugitive, bring him in,

170
00:08:02,663 --> 00:08:05,030
preferably in one piece.

171
00:08:05,055 --> 00:08:06,092
Now scram.

172
00:08:06,117 --> 00:08:07,350
- Hmm.
- Yep.

173
00:08:08,535 --> 00:08:10,175
You're willing to risk an entire mission

174
00:08:10,204 --> 00:08:11,270
to play matchmaker?

175
00:08:11,305 --> 00:08:12,371
I sure am.

176
00:08:12,406 --> 00:08:14,184
Honestly, I'm getting
a "just friends" vibe.

177
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:17,309
I bet you 20 bucks they
hook up on the mission.

178
00:08:17,344 --> 00:08:19,044
I will take that.

179
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:26,473
You and I running this
mission won't be weird at all.

180
00:08:26,498 --> 00:08:28,519
Yeah, it's gonna be super chill.

181
00:08:28,544 --> 00:08:30,263
Yeah.

182
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:33,356
And just because Sara and Ava are busy,

183
00:08:33,381 --> 00:08:34,667
doesn't mean everybody else is.

184
00:08:35,311 --> 00:08:37,957
Yes. Let's rally the troops.

185
00:08:37,982 --> 00:08:39,348
Yes.

186
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:45,980
Raymond, we got a
legit Time Bros mission.

187
00:08:46,005 --> 00:08:48,877
What? Time... Time Bros, that's us.

188
00:08:48,902 --> 00:08:53,305
Um, look, I just... I got
some stuff I am doing here.

189
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,944
Come on, put the "schmience" away.

190
00:08:54,969 --> 00:08:56,030
We got a magic-blip.

191
00:08:56,055 --> 00:08:58,010
Look, right now it's just me and Zari.

192
00:08:58,045 --> 00:08:59,577
And if I'm being totally honest,

193
00:08:59,613 --> 00:09:01,679
it's a little awkward between us.

194
00:09:01,715 --> 00:09:03,247
So I could really use my wingman.

195
00:09:03,282 --> 00:09:06,350
I was doing some interesting stuff here.

196
00:09:06,386 --> 00:09:08,686
It's something that has to do with me...

197
00:09:08,722 --> 00:09:12,460
Busy working on a
vaccine for N... nnn...

198
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:13,781
- For what?
- Nnn...

199
00:09:13,806 --> 00:09:14,946
You all right?

200
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,905
- I got it.
- You do... you do?

201
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:18,263
This is about Nora.

202
00:09:18,288 --> 00:09:20,297
I'm sitting here going on
and on about me and Zari.

203
00:09:20,322 --> 00:09:22,612
I'm not even thinking about
what you must be going through.

204
00:09:22,636 --> 00:09:24,836
I am sorry for being a bad friend.

205
00:09:24,871 --> 00:09:26,370
Bring it in.

206
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:30,775
What kind of punk-ass hug is that?

207
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:32,422
Bring it all the way in, Raymond.

208
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:33,500
Hug me.

209
00:09:33,525 --> 00:09:35,398
Look, whatever you're working on,

210
00:09:36,672 --> 00:09:38,072
you're gonna kill it.

211
00:09:38,097 --> 00:09:41,432
You're gonna absolutely murder it.

212
00:09:43,704 --> 00:09:44,803
Ow, Ray.

213
00:09:44,828 --> 00:09:47,868
Yeah, I just, um, sort
of sometimes like to do

214
00:09:47,893 --> 00:09:49,225
a pre-mission massage, you know?

215
00:09:49,261 --> 00:09:52,128
Just to limber up before
we get out in the field.

216
00:09:56,669 --> 00:09:57,933
Little too much?

217
00:09:57,957 --> 00:09:59,156
Yeah.

218
00:10:03,518 --> 00:10:06,699
Well? Say hello to Rebecca Silver.

219
00:10:12,349 --> 00:10:14,951
Try these.

220
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:18,442
Ah! Perfect.

221
00:10:20,392 --> 00:10:21,959
Nice getup.

222
00:10:21,984 --> 00:10:24,508
So you guys heard
we're headed to the 30s?

223
00:10:24,533 --> 00:10:26,163
- No.
- Well, you are.

224
00:10:26,188 --> 00:10:27,533
Sara put Nate and me in charge.

225
00:10:27,558 --> 00:10:29,783
Oh, you and Nate finally gonna...

226
00:10:29,808 --> 00:10:30,947
Boom-boom.

227
00:10:30,972 --> 00:10:31,972
Stop, stop.

228
00:10:31,997 --> 00:10:33,563
Okay. Guess what?

229
00:10:33,588 --> 00:10:35,255
You're on the Waverider,
so you're going.

230
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,750
Jumpship's got a full
tank, though, yeah?

231
00:10:36,774 --> 00:10:38,458
- Mm.
- Do you have somewhere to be?

232
00:10:38,483 --> 00:10:39,969
Oh, best you don't pry, love.

233
00:10:39,994 --> 00:10:41,956
Just like I'm not asking about
that naughty little number

234
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,838
Sara left behind for you to wear.

235
00:10:43,863 --> 00:10:45,262
Check your closet.

236
00:10:47,284 --> 00:10:49,551
- Rory, do you wanna maybe...
- Plans.

237
00:10:49,587 --> 00:10:51,686
Okay.

238
00:11:10,674 --> 00:11:12,715
I can't believe everyone
else bailed on the mission.

239
00:11:14,278 --> 00:11:17,312
More Adventurers' Society for us.

240
00:11:19,031 --> 00:11:21,498
All right, let's do this.

241
00:11:21,951 --> 00:11:24,051
- Allow me.
- Thank you.

242
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,572
I... I know these costumes
are totally ridiculous.

243
00:11:28,597 --> 00:11:32,166
You... you... you look absolutely um...

244
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,556
Yeah, ridiculous.

245
00:11:33,581 --> 00:11:37,361
Uh, apparently it's all part
of a cover story Sara gave me.

246
00:11:37,386 --> 00:11:41,087
I'm someone named Marion Ravenwood.

247
00:11:41,112 --> 00:11:43,360
Wait.

248
00:11:43,385 --> 00:11:44,438
Wait a second.

249
00:11:45,243 --> 00:11:46,310
Huh.

250
00:11:46,335 --> 00:11:50,437
Well, it says here I
am Dr. Henry Jones Jr.

251
00:11:50,813 --> 00:11:54,214
Professor of Archaeology,
expert in the occult,

252
00:11:54,249 --> 00:11:55,848
and how does one say this?

253
00:11:55,884 --> 00:11:58,418
Obtainer of rare antiquities.

254
00:11:59,854 --> 00:12:02,814
It's Indiana Jones. Yeah.

255
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:04,257
Sara set us up.

256
00:12:04,282 --> 00:12:05,635
What's that?

257
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,404
Adventurers' Society,

258
00:12:07,429 --> 00:12:09,343
everyone else unavailable
for the mission,

259
00:12:09,368 --> 00:12:11,665
dressing up like your favorite movie,

260
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:15,569
it's all a set up to send
us on the perfect date.

261
00:12:18,561 --> 00:12:21,462
I totally get if you
wanna go back to the ship.

262
00:12:21,487 --> 00:12:26,089
Or we can see where
this mission takes us.

263
00:12:34,121 --> 00:12:36,822
♪ We believe in the summer sun ♪

264
00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:39,191
♪ Neon rays, I'm gonna get me some ♪

265
00:12:39,227 --> 00:12:41,694
♪ Golden light come shine on everyone ♪

266
00:12:41,729 --> 00:12:44,763
Oh, Mick, we're gonna make a
killing off of these people.

267
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:46,232
Does Rebecca Silver belong in

268
00:12:46,267 --> 00:12:48,967
Sci-fi Erotica or Cyber Erotica?

269
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:51,491
Rebecca Silver defies all categories.

270
00:12:51,516 --> 00:12:52,562
Excuse me, you are?

271
00:12:52,587 --> 00:12:54,484
It's me you should be
talking to, actually.

272
00:12:54,508 --> 00:12:56,241
I am Rebecca Silver.

273
00:12:56,266 --> 00:12:57,521
And I do not appreciate the tone that

274
00:12:57,545 --> 00:12:59,044
you're taking with my bodyguard.

275
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:03,794
Oh, goodness, Miss Silver,
the Recluse of Romance.

276
00:13:03,819 --> 00:13:05,793
We are honored that you will be making

277
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:08,355
your first public
appearance ever with us.

278
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:11,166
You look exactly as I dreamed.

279
00:13:11,191 --> 00:13:12,634
I'm just here for the check, really.

280
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:14,825
Of course, and you will get it

281
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:17,595
after your public appearance,
Q and A, and book signing.

282
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:19,297
Oh, chitchat with a bunch of weirdos

283
00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:20,668
dressed as some ridiculous alien queen

284
00:13:20,692 --> 00:13:21,766
they all want to bang.

285
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,768
No problem.

286
00:13:25,947 --> 00:13:28,480
Number one, Garima is a warrior.

287
00:13:28,505 --> 00:13:29,977
Number two, you're being rude.

288
00:13:30,002 --> 00:13:32,136
Rude? That's rich coming from you.

289
00:13:32,161 --> 00:13:33,960
You're the rudest person I know.

290
00:13:33,985 --> 00:13:37,319
You don't get it. You need training.

291
00:13:37,344 --> 00:13:38,777
What time's the Q and A?

292
00:13:38,802 --> 00:13:40,802
In two hours.

293
00:13:40,827 --> 00:13:42,529
Good, we'll be there.

294
00:13:42,554 --> 00:13:46,056
♪ Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh ♪

295
00:13:49,819 --> 00:13:52,019
Let's do this.

296
00:13:56,715 --> 00:14:01,117
Okay, page one.

297
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:02,907
Is this on audiobook?

298
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:06,143
"They say your life flashes
before your eyes when you die.

299
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:09,312
But what if in that moment,
you finally see everything

300
00:14:09,347 --> 00:14:10,746
life's been trying to show you?

301
00:14:10,782 --> 00:14:14,750
That's how I discovered
that a killer was amongst me.

302
00:14:14,786 --> 00:14:15,930
I should've known

303
00:14:15,954 --> 00:14:16,964
something was amiss that night.

304
00:14:16,988 --> 00:14:17,999
I was returning from hot yoga

305
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,037
to my sensational cliff side home,

306
00:14:19,061 --> 00:14:20,239
matcha green tea smoothie in hand,

307
00:14:20,263 --> 00:14:21,563
when I noticed my
door was slightly ajar.

308
00:14:21,587 --> 00:14:23,004
I entered wondering if my dog walker

309
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,205
or cat sitter or personal shopper

310
00:14:24,229 --> 00:14:25,339
or astrologer had failed to close it.

311
00:14:25,363 --> 00:14:26,373
That's when I heard him say,

312
00:14:26,397 --> 00:14:28,583
"There's something I've
been meaning to kill you.""

313
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:32,786
Ladies and gentlemen.
Ladies and gentlemen, please.

314
00:14:35,038 --> 00:14:36,437
My esteemed colleagues,

315
00:14:36,462 --> 00:14:40,404
the honor of having my flag retired

316
00:14:40,429 --> 00:14:43,256
is only rivaled by the honor

317
00:14:43,281 --> 00:14:46,222
of sharing my latest discovery.

318
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:50,152
To retrieve it required not only

319
00:14:50,177 --> 00:14:52,744
besting the frozen
wasteland of the Arctic,

320
00:14:52,923 --> 00:14:55,758
but also the physical limitations

321
00:14:55,793 --> 00:14:57,560
of the human body itself.

322
00:14:58,929 --> 00:15:03,122
But for the sake of
exploration, I prevailed.

323
00:15:03,147 --> 00:15:06,748
And so, without further
ado, I present to you,

324
00:15:06,773 --> 00:15:13,442
Gordon Gilchrist's Golden Mystery Egg.

325
00:15:16,214 --> 00:15:17,412
Now, Vincent.

326
00:15:22,219 --> 00:15:24,947
In the words of Ray and Mike Tyson,

327
00:15:24,972 --> 00:15:27,973
I think we found our "myth-tery" man.

328
00:15:31,049 --> 00:15:32,581
Come on, science.

329
00:15:37,596 --> 00:15:38,762
Something's happening.

330
00:15:41,838 --> 00:15:44,106
I can feel my hand again.

331
00:15:44,141 --> 00:15:45,673
No, no, no, no, no.

332
00:15:45,709 --> 00:15:49,778
The infection... is spreading.

333
00:15:49,813 --> 00:15:53,347
Gideon, where in the
timeline is John Constantine?

334
00:15:53,383 --> 00:15:55,620
His last known whereabouts were in 2019

335
00:15:55,645 --> 00:15:56,744
with Gary Green.

336
00:15:56,769 --> 00:15:58,409
Would you like me to
connect... connect...

337
00:15:58,454 --> 00:16:00,721
What are you doing to me, Dr. Palmer?

338
00:16:00,756 --> 00:16:03,403
Gideon? Gideon?

339
00:16:03,428 --> 00:16:04,525
What?

340
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,060
What are you...

341
00:16:08,664 --> 00:16:11,465
We can't have anyone spying
on us now, can we Raymond?

342
00:16:12,912 --> 00:16:14,578
You're all alone now.

343
00:16:14,603 --> 00:16:17,905
Well, it's you and me.

344
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:20,556
Oh, yeah? Well...

345
00:16:20,581 --> 00:16:24,449
I'll just... I'll just do
this the old fashioned way.

346
00:16:26,349 --> 00:16:28,748
Ha.

347
00:16:33,307 --> 00:16:34,807
- Yello.
- Gary, hi.

348
00:16:34,832 --> 00:16:35,997
Ray Palmer here.

349
00:16:36,022 --> 00:16:38,956
By any chance, have you
spoken to Constantine lately?

350
00:16:38,981 --> 00:16:42,349
- Worried about Nora, huh?
- Yes, but no.

351
00:16:42,374 --> 00:16:43,941
I'm calling on a more personal matter.

352
00:16:43,966 --> 00:16:45,599
Say no more.

353
00:16:45,624 --> 00:16:47,491
I will be right over.

354
00:16:47,516 --> 00:16:48,649
What? No.

355
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:49,834
No, no, no, Gary. No, Gary...

356
00:16:52,101 --> 00:16:53,200
How can I help?

357
00:16:57,179 --> 00:16:58,411
Oh, no.

358
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:13,781
You hear something?

359
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:30,610
There's a guard.

360
00:17:30,635 --> 00:17:31,635
Okay.

361
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,882
Don't worry, I can talk
my way into anywhere.

362
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,196
Excuse me, my good man.

363
00:17:36,231 --> 00:17:38,498
Um, can you point me to
the nearest facilities?

364
00:17:38,534 --> 00:17:41,267
I have an urgent need
to, uh, relieve my bowels.

365
00:17:43,872 --> 00:17:45,672
Let's go.

366
00:17:53,248 --> 00:17:56,115
We are crushing this
mission, by the way.

367
00:17:56,151 --> 00:17:58,417
No classic Legends mishaps... Mmmm.

368
00:17:58,453 --> 00:18:01,087
And only one historically
insignificant nobody received

369
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:02,455
blunt-force trauma to the head.

370
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:04,023
Hmm.

371
00:18:05,994 --> 00:18:08,261
And now we get our prize.

372
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:10,230
Wait.

373
00:18:10,265 --> 00:18:11,865
Trip wires.

374
00:18:13,434 --> 00:18:14,734
This is gonna require one of us

375
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:15,913
to squeeze through these trip wires,

376
00:18:15,937 --> 00:18:19,705
maneuvering our bodies
in unexpected ways.

377
00:18:19,741 --> 00:18:21,640
Are you asking me to do that?

378
00:18:21,676 --> 00:18:24,442
No, I'm asking you to hold my coat.

379
00:18:25,612 --> 00:18:28,146
When I wrote, "Uncaged Desire,"

380
00:18:28,182 --> 00:18:31,549
I was trying to uncage my own desire.

381
00:18:31,585 --> 00:18:34,586
A desire to... to...

382
00:18:34,621 --> 00:18:37,622
to... oh, bollocks.
What's the next bit, again?

383
00:18:37,657 --> 00:18:41,093
To feel life, not just live it.

384
00:18:41,128 --> 00:18:43,962
You still don't know Rebecca.

385
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:45,964
Well, I know you and you're Rebecca.

386
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,532
Your primary mode of communication

387
00:18:47,567 --> 00:18:49,201
is grunting like a caveman.

388
00:18:50,371 --> 00:18:52,670
Besides, I mean, Rebecca Silver is

389
00:18:52,706 --> 00:18:53,872
whoever we want her to be.

390
00:18:53,908 --> 00:18:55,518
These people, they don't
know anything about her.

391
00:18:55,542 --> 00:18:57,074
What are you talking about?

392
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:59,638
They read her books,
they read her letters.

393
00:18:59,663 --> 00:19:01,463
Her letters?

394
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,282
Do you answer your fan mail?

395
00:19:05,441 --> 00:19:07,108
I just thought all this was a big laugh

396
00:19:07,133 --> 00:19:09,133
at their expense.

397
00:19:09,158 --> 00:19:10,444
Well, it's not.

398
00:19:23,269 --> 00:19:24,535
Hmm.

399
00:19:44,423 --> 00:19:46,323
Careful.

400
00:19:52,264 --> 00:19:54,230
The hell?

401
00:19:54,266 --> 00:19:56,132
It's papier-mâché.

402
00:19:57,169 --> 00:19:58,468
Oh, my God.

403
00:19:58,503 --> 00:20:01,637
She did this all for us.
It's all a set up.

404
00:20:01,673 --> 00:20:02,705
- No.
- Yeah.

405
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:03,739
- You think?
- Yeah.

406
00:20:03,764 --> 00:20:05,675
It was a fake Magic-O-Meter alert.

407
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:07,610
Sara concocted this whole thing.

408
00:20:07,645 --> 00:20:09,512
- I bet you they're actors too.
- Yep.

409
00:20:09,547 --> 00:20:12,515
"Gordon Gilchrist" with
that ridiculous facial hair?

410
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,817
The only that's missing, Nazis.

411
00:20:14,853 --> 00:20:16,151
Yeah.

412
00:20:16,187 --> 00:20:17,753
What did you do with the egg?

413
00:20:17,789 --> 00:20:21,056
- Hmm?
- The real egg?

414
00:20:21,092 --> 00:20:23,526
Oh, wow, she really went all out.

415
00:20:23,561 --> 00:20:26,696
Hmm.

416
00:20:30,034 --> 00:20:31,400
- Hey.
- Oh, there you are.

417
00:20:31,435 --> 00:20:33,280
I was beginning to think
you weren't gonna make it.

418
00:20:33,304 --> 00:20:35,838
This is a interesting choice of venue.

419
00:20:35,874 --> 00:20:37,807
We can't have book club without Nora.

420
00:20:37,842 --> 00:20:40,509
It takes all three of us
for a book club quorum.

421
00:20:40,544 --> 00:20:42,711
Very sweet.

422
00:20:42,746 --> 00:20:44,846
- Cheers, babe.
- Thank you.

423
00:20:44,882 --> 00:20:49,751
All right, so, who do you
guys think is the real killer?

424
00:20:49,786 --> 00:20:52,954
Because I have my theories.

425
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:55,590
Oh, my God, this can't be real.

426
00:20:55,626 --> 00:20:57,393
- I have to go now.
- What?

427
00:20:57,428 --> 00:21:00,362
You just said that book club
requires all three of you.

428
00:21:00,398 --> 00:21:02,631
It's Rebecca Silver.

429
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:06,935
She's revealing her identity
at Romanti-Con tonight.

430
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:08,303
Rebecca Silver?

431
00:21:08,339 --> 00:21:11,306
The sex-positive novelist
reinventing feminism.

432
00:21:11,342 --> 00:21:12,807
Yeah, we know who she is.

433
00:21:12,843 --> 00:21:15,209
Make sure you take lots of pictures.

434
00:21:15,245 --> 00:21:17,045
Oh, my God, thank you.

435
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,779
I can't believe I'm
going to be breathing

436
00:21:18,814 --> 00:21:20,548
the same air as Rebecca Silver.

437
00:21:23,986 --> 00:21:26,421
- Okay, so...
- Hmm?

438
00:21:26,456 --> 00:21:27,988
What did you think of the book?

439
00:21:28,024 --> 00:21:30,024
Oh, you wanna keep doing book club?

440
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:32,260
Babe, we don't have to.
We can just forget it.

441
00:21:32,295 --> 00:21:33,661
I thought it would be nice for us

442
00:21:33,696 --> 00:21:35,663
to be able to do something of yours.

443
00:21:35,698 --> 00:21:37,298
Aw.

444
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:39,567
That's so sweet, thank you.

445
00:21:40,836 --> 00:21:41,902
I didn't read the book.

446
00:21:41,938 --> 00:21:43,571
- What?
- Sorry.

447
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,072
Seriously?

448
00:21:45,097 --> 00:21:47,377
Honestly, I... I usually
just drink rosé and let Mona

449
00:21:47,402 --> 00:21:50,843
go on and on and use it as
a mini-vacay for my brain.

450
00:21:53,182 --> 00:21:56,749
Well, it was actually
a really good book.

451
00:21:56,785 --> 00:21:58,263
Wait, wait, wait. You... uh, come on.

452
00:21:58,287 --> 00:22:00,787
I can still drink rosé,
and you can go on and on.

453
00:22:00,822 --> 00:22:02,489
- Hmm.
- Come on.

454
00:22:02,524 --> 00:22:04,157
- Come on.
- Okay, fine.

455
00:22:04,193 --> 00:22:08,462
So, I think the real
killer was the dog walker.

456
00:22:08,497 --> 00:22:10,163
- No.
- Yes.

457
00:22:10,199 --> 00:22:13,533
I mean, all that pent-up frustration,

458
00:22:13,569 --> 00:22:15,969
and she treated him like a doormat.

459
00:22:17,772 --> 00:22:19,939
You can't help me. I need Constantine.

460
00:22:19,975 --> 00:22:22,441
Well, I may not be a
master of the dark arts,

461
00:22:22,477 --> 00:22:24,776
but I am an intern of the dark arts.

462
00:22:24,812 --> 00:22:27,379
You're interning for Constantine?

463
00:22:27,415 --> 00:22:28,547
Yeah.

464
00:22:28,583 --> 00:22:30,026
He's letting me study his spell books,

465
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:31,528
if I water his plants
while he searches for

466
00:22:31,552 --> 00:22:32,684
a cure for Nora.

467
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,786
But besides, what other
options do you have?

468
00:22:34,822 --> 00:22:37,889
Come on, tell the Garebear what ails ya.

469
00:22:37,925 --> 00:22:40,259
I... I don't know how to explain it,

470
00:22:40,294 --> 00:22:42,828
but it feels like...

471
00:22:42,863 --> 00:22:45,197
like there's something inside of me.

472
00:22:45,233 --> 00:22:46,378
Oh, yeah, you know,

473
00:22:46,403 --> 00:22:47,944
there's a beautiful singer inside of me,

474
00:22:47,968 --> 00:22:49,213
but no one's ever gonna meet her.

475
00:22:49,237 --> 00:22:51,737
No, no, Gary. No, Gary, this is bad.

476
00:22:51,772 --> 00:22:53,071
This is very bad,

477
00:22:53,107 --> 00:22:55,073
and I don't know how to get it out.

478
00:22:55,109 --> 00:22:58,043
Indigestion. I know just the spell.

479
00:22:58,078 --> 00:23:00,145
I'll have your pipes
cleared out in no time.

480
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,449
Let me just look it up.

481
00:23:03,717 --> 00:23:05,494
Oh, good thing it's not a demon,

482
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:07,786
because if it was, you
wouldn't be able to tell me.

483
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:12,557
"A weird rule that
keeps the victim silent

484
00:23:12,592 --> 00:23:14,793
all the while trying
to murder a loved one

485
00:23:14,828 --> 00:23:15,913
in order to seal in

486
00:23:15,938 --> 00:23:17,963
the demonic possession forever."

487
00:23:20,534 --> 00:23:22,567
Why did you just stab yourself?

488
00:23:22,602 --> 00:23:23,935
I didn't.

489
00:23:23,971 --> 00:23:26,138
You're possessed.

490
00:23:26,173 --> 00:23:27,238
Yes!

491
00:23:27,274 --> 00:23:30,107
I... I... I can help.

492
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:36,047
Where is the egg?

493
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:37,347
Take it easy, Hitler Youth.

494
00:23:37,383 --> 00:23:39,583
The egg's broken, it was a crappy prop.

495
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:42,887
The real egg. Do not anger me.

496
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:44,254
Look, this was a good effort.

497
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:46,857
Like really good, but
we've done Nazis before.

498
00:23:46,893 --> 00:23:48,325
But, like, real Nazis.

499
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,261
So, if it's okay with
you, I would rather just...

500
00:23:51,297 --> 00:23:52,930
pull the plug on this.

501
00:23:52,965 --> 00:23:53,965
Yep.

502
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,701
- My friend here is a surgeon.
- Oh, nice.

503
00:23:56,736 --> 00:23:58,268
He will kill you until you tell me

504
00:23:58,304 --> 00:24:00,104
where the real egg is.

505
00:24:00,139 --> 00:24:02,372
Uh, yeah, let's tell
Sara we're onto her.

506
00:24:02,408 --> 00:24:04,308
Yeah.

507
00:24:04,343 --> 00:24:06,009
Hello.

508
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:08,845
Hi, Sara, Nate and Zari here.

509
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,280
First of all, well played.

510
00:24:10,316 --> 00:24:12,082
Yeah, setting up this whole adventure

511
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:14,418
for us to go on a date
was way over the top.

512
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,453
But in the same breath, very sweet.

513
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:17,599
And if I were to give a note,

514
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:19,690
the Nazis were just,
like, a tad too much.

515
00:24:19,725 --> 00:24:21,391
What are... what are you talking about?

516
00:24:21,427 --> 00:24:24,060
Are they in the same theater
troupe as Ava's parents?

517
00:24:24,096 --> 00:24:26,330
- What?
- Sara, drop the act.

518
00:24:26,365 --> 00:24:28,599
Nazis killing us with throwing daggers?

519
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:30,900
- Come on.
- Listen to me.

520
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:33,136
Look, I did purposefully
put the two of you

521
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:35,672
on a mission together,
but this is a real mission.

522
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:37,941
Not a game. Those are real Nazis.

523
00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:41,410
Whoa!

524
00:24:48,151 --> 00:24:51,620
And now, young lady, you die.

525
00:24:52,589 --> 00:24:54,523
- Sorry, Nate.
- For what?

526
00:25:07,069 --> 00:25:08,669
Wow. You okay?

527
00:25:08,704 --> 00:25:10,604
Yeah, it was actually really intense.

528
00:25:15,411 --> 00:25:17,122
See, they took care
of things on their own.

529
00:25:17,146 --> 00:25:20,180
And they were clearly about to hook up.

530
00:25:20,215 --> 00:25:21,885
- No, they weren't... wait.
- You owe me 20 bucks.

531
00:25:21,909 --> 00:25:23,564
Uh-huh, uh-huh. Were
guys about to hook up?

532
00:25:23,588 --> 00:25:25,035
- It was definitely... on the table.
- No, no, no. No, no, no.

533
00:25:25,059 --> 00:25:26,089
See?

534
00:25:26,114 --> 00:25:27,214
- Come on.
- I told you.

535
00:25:27,239 --> 00:25:28,421
It doesn't matter. Okay,
now that you know that

536
00:25:28,445 --> 00:25:29,886
it's a real mission, where's the egg?

537
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:31,342
Yeah, and where is Ray?

538
00:25:31,367 --> 00:25:33,208
Isn't he supposed to be
quarterbacking on this?

539
00:25:35,389 --> 00:25:36,689
Ray?

540
00:25:36,714 --> 00:25:37,849
Ray, come in.

541
00:25:37,874 --> 00:25:40,800
Nate, buddy, don't go back to the ship

542
00:25:40,825 --> 00:25:41,891
under any circumstances.

543
00:25:41,916 --> 00:25:43,082
You okay, buddy?

544
00:25:43,107 --> 00:25:46,102
Yeah, just, uh, cleaning
up a storm over here.

545
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:48,493
I don't want you to trip
and break your neck...

546
00:25:48,529 --> 00:25:49,806
on the mopped floors.

547
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:51,602
Okay, bye.

548
00:25:51,627 --> 00:25:52,654
Bye.

549
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:54,023
Okay, that was weird, even for Ray.

550
00:25:54,047 --> 00:25:55,113
We should check on him.

551
00:25:55,138 --> 00:25:57,205
You go check on Ray,
we'll handle the egg.

552
00:25:57,230 --> 00:26:00,069
Um, I'm sorry that our first date

553
00:26:00,094 --> 00:26:02,794
got ruined by Nazis.

554
00:26:02,819 --> 00:26:04,485
Who says it's ruined?

555
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:16,247
Okay, what do we know?

556
00:26:16,272 --> 00:26:19,312
We found an egg, but it was fake.

557
00:26:19,337 --> 00:26:20,869
Someone stole the real one. Hm.

558
00:26:20,894 --> 00:26:23,528
Hey, what about that
Gordon Gilchrist guy?

559
00:26:23,564 --> 00:26:25,363
He's the one who found it,

560
00:26:25,399 --> 00:26:27,043
so I don't know why he
would have stolen it.

561
00:26:27,067 --> 00:26:29,467
Although, I sort of think
his poor assistant Vincent

562
00:26:29,503 --> 00:26:30,802
did most of the work.

563
00:26:30,837 --> 00:26:34,072
- Wait, that's just like book.
- It is?

564
00:26:34,107 --> 00:26:36,441
The book from book club.

565
00:26:36,476 --> 00:26:37,875
Vincent is the doormat!

566
00:26:37,911 --> 00:26:39,877
Look, it's always the doormat.

567
00:26:39,913 --> 00:26:41,479
It was the dog walker in the book,

568
00:26:41,515 --> 00:26:44,549
and now this Vincent guy's mad
that he didn't get any credit.

569
00:26:44,585 --> 00:26:46,484
So we find Vincent, take the egg,

570
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,597
and wipe everyone's memories.

571
00:26:47,621 --> 00:26:49,187
Easy.

572
00:26:50,856 --> 00:26:53,890
Ray, Ray.

573
00:26:53,926 --> 00:26:55,559
Remember, if you kill a loved one,

574
00:26:55,595 --> 00:26:57,060
Neron will take over.

575
00:26:57,096 --> 00:26:59,363
Oh, well, here's the thing, Gary.

576
00:26:59,398 --> 00:27:01,832
I... I like you, but...

577
00:27:01,867 --> 00:27:03,300
Oh.

578
00:27:05,605 --> 00:27:09,258
Yeah, got it.

579
00:27:09,283 --> 00:27:10,891
Ol' Gare...

580
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:15,081
Not loved by the Legends,

581
00:27:17,816 --> 00:27:19,998
bottom of the pecking
order at the Bureau.

582
00:27:24,522 --> 00:27:27,506
Constantine's plant sitter.

583
00:27:29,661 --> 00:27:31,327
Always the butt of the joke.

584
00:27:31,363 --> 00:27:33,396
Gary, it's not like that.

585
00:27:36,268 --> 00:27:38,201
It is like that, Gary.

586
00:27:38,237 --> 00:27:39,836
No one appreciates you.

587
00:27:39,872 --> 00:27:41,972
They all think you're
a fool that they can use

588
00:27:42,007 --> 00:27:44,440
whenever it's convenient for them.

589
00:27:44,476 --> 00:27:47,878
But I respect you, and
I see your potential.

590
00:27:47,913 --> 00:27:49,479
Neron?

591
00:27:49,514 --> 00:27:52,282
Gary, don't listen to him.
He's trying to trick you.

592
00:27:52,317 --> 00:27:54,651
A demon can't renege
on the deals they make.

593
00:27:54,686 --> 00:27:58,388
So you can believe me when I say

594
00:27:58,423 --> 00:28:01,257
I can make you whole again.

595
00:28:03,261 --> 00:28:04,960
Whole?

596
00:28:06,665 --> 00:28:09,465
Rebecca, first let me
say that your novel,

597
00:28:09,501 --> 00:28:12,468
"Uncaged Desires," was
a sexual epiphany for me.

598
00:28:12,504 --> 00:28:14,337
I can't say that I'm surprised.

599
00:28:14,372 --> 00:28:15,938
My writing does have that effect.

600
00:28:15,973 --> 00:28:20,376
But how did Officer
Daphne free Tank Tremors?

601
00:28:20,412 --> 00:28:22,312
Can prison guards release inmates

602
00:28:22,347 --> 00:28:23,424
just because they're in love?

603
00:28:23,448 --> 00:28:26,349
Oh, well, you see that was a metaphor.

604
00:28:26,384 --> 00:28:30,720
After all, aren't we all in
our own prisons of desire?

605
00:28:30,755 --> 00:28:32,788
Rebecca, in "Heat Waves,"

606
00:28:32,824 --> 00:28:36,525
who is the unnamed villain
who's stalking Garima?

607
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,460
- Charlie?
- What is a villain?

608
00:28:38,495 --> 00:28:41,096
Is it just someone with
a different point of view?

609
00:28:41,132 --> 00:28:44,733
What's really stalking Garima
are the choices that she made.

610
00:28:50,241 --> 00:28:54,476
So, you're the real Rebecca Silver, huh?

611
00:28:54,511 --> 00:28:56,678
Hi, yes.

612
00:28:56,714 --> 00:28:58,225
I mean, that is what I have embroidered

613
00:28:58,249 --> 00:28:59,882
on my satin pillow cases.

614
00:29:01,085 --> 00:29:02,184
Okay, then.

615
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:06,455
I have a question about
your novel, "Raw Hides."

616
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:10,425
When Captain Cash Harvey
fights the Prairie Bandits,

617
00:29:10,461 --> 00:29:15,364
why does Nasgowa stow away
in his Conestoga wagon?

618
00:29:15,399 --> 00:29:20,235
Well, you see, that is also a metaphor.

619
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:21,870
That is not a metaphor.

620
00:29:21,905 --> 00:29:24,473
She really did it, and
she died because of it.

621
00:29:24,508 --> 00:29:26,975
The real Rebecca Silver would know.

622
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:29,478
I am the real Rebecca Silver.

623
00:29:29,513 --> 00:29:31,446
I have tea with lemon.

624
00:29:31,482 --> 00:29:32,714
I have a really small dog.

625
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:34,483
You're a fraud!

626
00:29:34,518 --> 00:29:36,852
Where's the real Rebecca?

627
00:29:36,887 --> 00:29:39,620
Where's the real Rebecca?

628
00:29:39,655 --> 00:29:43,257
Where's the real Rebecca?
Where's the real Rebecca?

629
00:29:43,292 --> 00:29:45,862
Right, go to hell, you
stinkin' mouth breathers.

630
00:29:46,996 --> 00:29:48,596
Where's the real Rebecca?

631
00:29:48,631 --> 00:29:50,464
Where's the real Rebecca?

632
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:53,901
- Where's the real Rebecca?
- Quiet!

633
00:29:53,936 --> 00:29:56,036
Give me that.

634
00:29:56,071 --> 00:29:59,373
Nasgowa chased Cash for one reason.

635
00:29:59,409 --> 00:30:02,843
It's the same reason
humans have gotten together

636
00:30:02,879 --> 00:30:04,478
since the dawn of time.

637
00:30:04,514 --> 00:30:06,414
It's why people like you

638
00:30:06,449 --> 00:30:09,049
come to conventions and dress up

639
00:30:09,084 --> 00:30:10,951
as your favorite characters,

640
00:30:10,986 --> 00:30:14,721
why a man sits behind a desk, typing,

641
00:30:14,756 --> 00:30:16,390
pouring out his heart,

642
00:30:16,425 --> 00:30:20,994
why an author, a writer,

643
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:23,196
replies to fans.

644
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:25,032
It's connection.

645
00:30:25,067 --> 00:30:26,519
Human connection.

646
00:30:28,537 --> 00:30:31,571
I am Rebecca Silver.

647
00:30:33,575 --> 00:30:37,577
You... you are Rebecca.

648
00:30:37,612 --> 00:30:40,914
I'd recognize that wisdom anywhere!

649
00:30:54,829 --> 00:30:56,095
I would've come sooner, Nora,

650
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:58,497
but have you any idea
how hard it is to acquire

651
00:30:58,532 --> 00:31:00,499
a phoenix's tail feather?

652
00:31:00,534 --> 00:31:03,970
I didn't. All right.

653
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:08,874
By the power above and below,

654
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:12,178
I call you on you, Nora
Darhk, to return to this plane

655
00:31:12,213 --> 00:31:13,912
and rise reborn.

656
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,952
Come on, love.

657
00:31:20,988 --> 00:31:23,989
Come back to me. Come on, love.

658
00:31:28,362 --> 00:31:29,461
Get Neron.

659
00:31:29,496 --> 00:31:30,706
No-no-no, it's all right,
love, it's all right.

660
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:32,530
- He's gone. You did it.
- N... no.

661
00:31:32,565 --> 00:31:33,931
He's gone.

662
00:31:33,967 --> 00:31:36,267
He has Ray.

663
00:31:42,064 --> 00:31:44,197
Ray?

664
00:31:44,233 --> 00:31:45,868
Gideon, where's Ray?

665
00:31:47,637 --> 00:31:50,838
Nate, you shouldn't have come.

666
00:31:50,873 --> 00:31:52,506
Ray, what's going on?

667
00:31:52,541 --> 00:31:55,141
You should leave. You
can't let me get near...

668
00:31:55,176 --> 00:31:57,276
Ray, what are you saying?

669
00:32:04,418 --> 00:32:06,285
You've been acting so weird lately.

670
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,353
Thought we were bros.

671
00:32:07,388 --> 00:32:08,487
It's not me.

672
00:32:08,523 --> 00:32:10,089
No, see, it's N...

673
00:32:10,125 --> 00:32:11,590
It's Ner...

674
00:32:11,626 --> 00:32:12,759
What's near?

675
00:32:12,794 --> 00:32:14,493
- Somebody's nearby?
- No.

676
00:32:17,532 --> 00:32:20,033
All right, people, gather around.

677
00:32:20,068 --> 00:32:22,869
Vincent? What's the meaning of this?

678
00:32:22,904 --> 00:32:24,704
I found it.

679
00:32:24,739 --> 00:32:25,823
Hand over the egg.

680
00:32:25,848 --> 00:32:27,216
I should get credit for it!

681
00:32:27,241 --> 00:32:30,509
The egg is my accomplishment.
It belongs to me.

682
00:32:30,545 --> 00:32:32,456
Everyone's memory of the
egg is about to be erased,

683
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,446
so don't get too bent out of shape.

684
00:32:34,482 --> 00:32:36,114
Not so fast.

685
00:32:38,052 --> 00:32:41,753
Finally, the egg is ours.

686
00:32:41,789 --> 00:32:43,855
Oh, man, these guys.

687
00:32:47,162 --> 00:32:50,362
I'm Ray, the wrist of me isn't.

688
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:52,631
Nate, you have to get out of here.

689
00:32:52,667 --> 00:32:55,267
You have to leave. I
won't leave you, buddy.

690
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:58,237
Okay, you got possessed by Neron.

691
00:32:58,272 --> 00:32:59,938
You have to go.

692
00:32:59,973 --> 00:33:01,084
He's gonna make me kill you.

693
00:33:01,108 --> 00:33:04,342
No, because I believe you, Raymond,

694
00:33:04,377 --> 00:33:06,111
are stronger than he is.

695
00:33:14,722 --> 00:33:17,723
Nate, I'm so sorry.

696
00:33:17,758 --> 00:33:20,558
Why... why are you hitting me?

697
00:33:20,594 --> 00:33:23,294
Can't... stop...

698
00:33:24,331 --> 00:33:25,797
We're bros!

699
00:33:25,833 --> 00:33:28,200
We are bros!

700
00:33:34,141 --> 00:33:38,409
No, no, no...

701
00:33:38,445 --> 00:33:40,345
No!

702
00:33:41,615 --> 00:33:42,813
Okay, I give up!

703
00:33:42,849 --> 00:33:44,293
I give you up, do you hear me, Neron?

704
00:33:44,317 --> 00:33:45,916
I give up!

705
00:33:45,952 --> 00:33:47,685
Spare Nate and I'll let you...

706
00:33:47,721 --> 00:33:48,721
I'll let you have me.

707
00:33:48,755 --> 00:33:50,755
Just promise me you won't hurt him,

708
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:53,157
and I won't resist.

709
00:34:04,237 --> 00:34:06,271
Deal.

710
00:34:11,076 --> 00:34:14,010
It's nice to have a willing host.

711
00:34:16,815 --> 00:34:19,816
But... a promise is a promise.

712
00:34:31,363 --> 00:34:33,530
- We gotta get that egg.
- On it.

713
00:34:54,151 --> 00:34:56,285
Okay, I got you.

714
00:35:08,966 --> 00:35:10,633
See them whip skills?

715
00:35:10,668 --> 00:35:12,668
Yeah, it gave me an idea for date night.

716
00:35:12,704 --> 00:35:13,869
Mm.

717
00:35:17,607 --> 00:35:20,008
Oh, come on, now, don't be shy.

718
00:35:20,044 --> 00:35:21,877
You're a little late, Johnny.

719
00:35:21,912 --> 00:35:26,381
I've, uh, sort of taken
over jolly old Ray.

720
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:32,687
Phew.

721
00:35:32,723 --> 00:35:34,689
So you've lost a step.

722
00:35:34,725 --> 00:35:36,291
That's the thing about mortals.

723
00:35:36,327 --> 00:35:38,227
They age so quickly.

724
00:35:38,262 --> 00:35:40,128
But don't worry, Johnny.

725
00:35:40,164 --> 00:35:42,264
I won't let you die of old age.

726
00:35:42,299 --> 00:35:43,498
Yeah, well, uh,

727
00:35:43,533 --> 00:35:45,633
I might be a little older, mate, but

728
00:35:45,669 --> 00:35:48,636
I've picked up a few
tricks along the way.

729
00:35:52,642 --> 00:35:54,275
And that one's from Marie Laveau.

730
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:55,543
Cute trick.

731
00:35:55,579 --> 00:35:57,746
But we both know you won't
be able to hold it for long.

732
00:35:57,781 --> 00:35:59,180
You're a parasite.

733
00:35:59,215 --> 00:36:01,783
And I will separate you from Ray Palmer.

734
00:36:06,089 --> 00:36:08,723
Oh, Gary. Where have you been?

735
00:36:08,759 --> 00:36:11,760
Uh, I was hiding in the lab,

736
00:36:11,795 --> 00:36:13,461
then I heard noises.

737
00:36:13,497 --> 00:36:15,007
Yeah, well, go and get my steamtrunk.

738
00:36:15,031 --> 00:36:17,248
and we can exorcise
this demon right now.

739
00:36:19,569 --> 00:36:21,215
Damn it, Gary, now is not the time

740
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,772
for you to be standing around
like some hapless idiot.

741
00:36:23,807 --> 00:36:25,707
I can't hold this bastard forever.

742
00:36:25,742 --> 00:36:26,742
Do it now!

743
00:36:26,776 --> 00:36:28,876
Demands a lot from
you, doesn't he, Gary?

744
00:36:28,912 --> 00:36:31,312
But what has he ever done for you?

745
00:36:31,347 --> 00:36:34,848
I, on the other hand,
brought you a gift.

746
00:36:34,884 --> 00:36:38,219
Go ahead. Open it.

747
00:36:43,927 --> 00:36:46,260
No-no-no-no-no-no.

748
00:36:46,296 --> 00:36:49,596
Oh, don't accept
anything from him, Gary.

749
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:01,107
My nipple.

750
00:37:02,377 --> 00:37:03,421
Gary, listen to me, that part of you,

751
00:37:03,445 --> 00:37:04,510
it belongs to Hell now.

752
00:37:04,546 --> 00:37:06,313
All right? Don't let it seduce you.

753
00:37:06,348 --> 00:37:09,282
The same way John seduced you

754
00:37:09,318 --> 00:37:11,217
into being unicorn bait?

755
00:37:15,257 --> 00:37:16,289
It's beautiful.

756
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:20,327
It's cursed.

757
00:37:20,362 --> 00:37:22,462
Now back away from it, you bloody fool.

758
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:26,199
It belongs to you, Gary.

759
00:37:26,234 --> 00:37:28,279
Come on, Gary, think about
what you're doing, all right?

760
00:37:28,303 --> 00:37:30,303
Don't give in to its temptation.

761
00:37:30,339 --> 00:37:31,838
How'd I do?

762
00:37:31,873 --> 00:37:34,273
Time dweeb! The hell are you doing here?

763
00:37:34,308 --> 00:37:36,442
- What do I do?
- Shut up, Gary.

764
00:37:36,477 --> 00:37:41,313
I'm tired of being a doormat.

765
00:37:43,284 --> 00:37:45,417
Gary, no!

766
00:38:01,202 --> 00:38:03,068
Well done, Mr. Green.

767
00:38:03,104 --> 00:38:05,670
I'm whole again.

768
00:38:09,943 --> 00:38:13,211
All systems back online.

769
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:20,206
So, Zari, some big moves back there.

770
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:22,888
- Yeah, you were really brave.
- Thanks.

771
00:38:22,923 --> 00:38:25,089
So why are you scared
to make a move on Nate?

772
00:38:26,192 --> 00:38:28,159
Nate.

773
00:38:29,763 --> 00:38:31,162
What happened?

774
00:38:31,197 --> 00:38:33,064
Where is he?

775
00:38:33,099 --> 00:38:34,399
Who?

776
00:38:34,434 --> 00:38:35,569
Ray.

777
00:38:37,738 --> 00:38:39,538
Neron's got him.

778
00:38:54,347 --> 00:38:56,048
Sara, hey!

779
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:59,484
We got you a collectible
Romanti-Con tote bag.

780
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:01,874
- Who died?
- Yeah, what's going on?

781
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,843
I have some bad news.

782
00:39:07,027 --> 00:39:08,719
I told you, I'm fine.

783
00:39:08,744 --> 00:39:10,289
She's stable, Director.

784
00:39:10,314 --> 00:39:11,725
- Thank you.
- Ava, you shouldn't be here.

785
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:14,063
You should be scouring every
second of the time line for Ray.

786
00:39:14,087 --> 00:39:15,641
Agents are on it as we speak.

787
00:39:15,666 --> 00:39:17,799
Oh, why did he do that?

788
00:39:17,824 --> 00:39:19,623
Look, I know you've been through a lot,

789
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:20,714
but I need your help.

790
00:39:20,739 --> 00:39:23,273
My help?

791
00:39:23,298 --> 00:39:25,164
Why?

792
00:39:25,283 --> 00:39:28,583
Because no matter how many
agents I send after Neron,

793
00:39:28,608 --> 00:39:30,354
none of them can do what
you do, none of them,

794
00:39:30,378 --> 00:39:33,178
have the powers you have, Nora.

795
00:39:33,203 --> 00:39:36,137
And I trust you.

796
00:39:36,162 --> 00:39:39,397
Nora Darhk, I am asking
you to face another demon,

797
00:39:39,422 --> 00:39:41,956
but this time I am asking you to face it

798
00:39:42,329 --> 00:39:44,228
as a member of the Time Bureau.

799
00:39:55,754 --> 00:39:58,188
Let's do this.

800
00:40:01,474 --> 00:40:03,118
Whoa, whoa, whoa, you
haven't recovered yet.

801
00:40:03,142 --> 00:40:06,210
We gotta track down Ray.

802
00:40:06,235 --> 00:40:08,603
You will when you're better, I promise.

803
00:40:08,628 --> 00:40:10,227
You don't just throw a man down

804
00:40:10,252 --> 00:40:11,363
with these sort of injuries.

805
00:40:11,387 --> 00:40:13,488
- It's mean-spirited.
- Don't be a baby.

806
00:40:13,513 --> 00:40:15,713
- Does this hurt?
- Yes, Zari.

807
00:40:15,738 --> 00:40:17,237
It all hurts.

808
00:40:17,262 --> 00:40:19,729
Well, where doesn't it hurt, Nate?

809
00:40:19,754 --> 00:40:21,288
Here?

810
00:40:21,313 --> 00:40:22,612
Yeah.

811
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:35,195
Here?

812
00:40:42,772 --> 00:40:45,553
I guess there's an upside
to getting pummeled.

813
00:40:48,229 --> 00:40:51,296
You know how I never let anyone know

814
00:40:51,321 --> 00:40:53,989
what I'm really feeling?

815
00:40:54,014 --> 00:40:55,569
It's kind of your thing.

00:41:10,004 --> 00:41:12,652
That's how I feel, Nate.

817
00:41:14,002 --> 00:41:15,675
I feel the same.

818
00:41:25,457 --> 00:41:28,691
Oh. Gideon?

819
00:41:28,716 --> 00:41:30,582
What kind of egg is that?

820
00:41:32,298 --> 00:41:35,932
I believe, Dr. Heywood,
it's a dragon egg.

821
00:41:37,515 --> 00:41:39,715
Ohh...

822
00:41:41,171 --> 00:41:42,838
Oh.

823
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:44,724
Of course.
