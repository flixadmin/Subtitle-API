00:07:05,726 --> 00:07:07,826
- No, it's quite the opposite.

181
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:09,761
Without a way to track
the whereabouts of the pilgrim,

182
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:12,831
She could target
any one of you

183
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,566
At any point in time.

185
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:22,374

the pilgrim's temporal wake.

186
00:07:22,376 --> 00:07:23,809
I didn't think it was possible

187
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:25,544
To conceal one's movements
through time.

188
00:07:25,546 --> 00:07:26,912
- Well, it is if the time
masters are on your side.

189
00:07:26,914 --> 00:07:28,513
- How does this all work?

190
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:30,449
If she can travel
to any place at any time,

191
00:07:30,451 --> 00:07:32,384
She could be killing
any of us right now.

192
00:07:32,386 --> 00:07:34,786
- And if we die in the past--
- we die in the present.

193
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,488
- Wow. So interesting.

194
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,390
How long does it take for
what happens in the past

195
00:07:38,392 --> 00:07:40,425
To affect the present?

196
00:07:40,427 --> 00:07:41,993
Could I be dead right now
and not know it?

197
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:44,162
Maybe I am dead right now.

198
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:45,864
Hello? Can anybody hear me?

199
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:47,466
- No.

200
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:48,867
- Look, the important
thing is not to panic.

201
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:50,135
- Somebody's playing
russian roulette

202
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:51,136

203
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:52,771
Why would we panic?

204
00:07:52,773 --> 00:07:54,072
- Well, there are
a few exceptions.

205
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:55,640
Kendra's ability to reincarnate

206
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,075
Means that it would
do the pilgrim

207
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:58,777
No good to target her.

208
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:00,645
And as a former time master,

209
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,647
To remove me from history

210
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:05,484
Would be quite dangerous
to the timeline.

211
00:08:05,486 --> 00:08:07,118
- Well, that's convenient.

212
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,453
- And what's that supposed
to mean?

213
00:08:08,455 --> 00:08:09,454
- Nothing.

214
00:08:09,456 --> 00:08:10,822
It just occurs to me

215
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:13,725
You've never told us
about your past, rip.

216
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:16,161
And I don't trust
a man with secrets.

217
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:19,030
- Look, the less information
you have to offer on me,

218
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:20,532
The less valuable

219
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:22,767
You are to our now
numerous enemies.

220
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:25,570

221

- This is not a fight.

00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:29,541
It's merely
an exchange of ideas.

- She slapped me.

227
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:36,615
- The little weirdo said

228
00:08:36,617 --> 00:08:37,949
That he liked the way
that I smelled.

229
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:39,451

230

But I'm sort of
freaking out right now.

231

And you...You're not her type.

234
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:49,861
Now, do I need

00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:53,598

242
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,909
Please, will you just tell me
what the hell's going on?

243
00:09:03,911 --> 00:09:06,511
- Look, it's safer
for you if I don't.

244
00:09:06,513 --> 00:09:09,548
And we look alike, because--

245
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,149
Because we're like family.

246
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:13,652
And I need you to trust me.

247
00:09:13,654 --> 00:09:16,488

he's got to be freaking out.

248
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:17,489
If he ever lost me--

249
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:19,891
- He won't lose you.

And you've never quite resorted
to eating sugary cereals.

about the past,

Now, can I interest any of you

My birth name.

Of new identities

about the time masters?

He had nothing
but the clothes on his back.

603
00:22:38,324 --> 00:22:40,424
There's a reason
it's called the refuge,

604
00:22:40,426 --> 00:22:43,627
And a reason that it exists
in a secret location in history.

605
00:22:43,629 --> 00:22:45,696
The time masters will never
think to look for you here.

- Thank you for your assistance.

I think you fell in love
with the flames dancing around.

622
00:23:30,543 --> 00:23:32,510
But then you realized
you couldn't control them,

623
00:23:32,512 --> 00:23:36,380
And you ran without
waking your family.

If there is, I'm gonna
come looking for you.

I'm gonna kill you.

to leave this place just yet.

636

- I've made you something
for your travels.

Some mince pies
for your friends.

638
00:24:18,691 --> 00:24:20,491
- My friends.

639
00:24:20,493 --> 00:24:21,992
They're the people
whose relationships

640
00:24:21,994 --> 00:24:23,427
With their friends and family

641
00:24:23,429 --> 00:24:25,596
I've put at risk
to save my family.

642
00:24:25,598 --> 00:24:27,064
- You think you've been selfish?

643
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:30,067
- I do, yes.
- What a load of old codswallop.

644
00:24:30,069 --> 00:24:31,869
I've always known

645
00:24:31,871 --> 00:24:34,071
That you were brought to me
for a reason, michael.

646
00:24:34,073 --> 00:24:36,040
That you were ready
for great things,

647
00:24:36,042 --> 00:24:38,509
But you won't accomplish
anything by wallowing.

648
00:24:38,511 --> 00:24:40,044
So for goodness' sake,
pull yourself out of it

649
00:24:40,046 --> 00:24:41,545
And get the job done.
- And what about you?

650
00:24:41,547 --> 00:24:43,180
I have put you
in terrible danger.

651
00:24:43,182 --> 00:24:44,682
- You don't honestly
think I'd let

652
00:24:44,684 --> 00:24:46,417
You go away
with my best serving dish

653
00:24:46,419 --> 00:24:49,520
If I didn't think
I'd see you again, do you?

654
00:24:49,522 --> 00:24:51,589
I can manage quite happily

655
00:24:51,591 --> 00:24:54,792
With a house full
of 10-year-old time masters,

656
00:24:54,794 --> 00:24:56,961
So I think I can perfectly deal
with the adult version.

657
00:24:56,963 --> 00:24:58,629
Go on!

658
00:24:58,631 --> 00:25:01,866

What's up, man, we good?

We share a psychic connection.

I know how you're feeling,

666
00:25:25,625 --> 00:25:27,458
I thought affording you time
with your father

667
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,593
Would lift your spirits.

I just...

00:25:35,735 --> 00:25:37,601
I should have said something.

672
00:25:37,603 --> 00:25:39,870
I should've told him about what
happens to him in mogadishu.

673

I could've saved him.

- You don't know that.

675
00:25:42,542 --> 00:25:44,174
It's highly unlikely

676
00:25:44,176 --> 00:25:46,510
You could've said anything
that would've changed his fate.

677
00:25:46,512 --> 00:25:48,612
- My whole life,

678
00:25:48,614 --> 00:25:50,714
Everything good I ever did,

679
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:52,049
Every report card,

680
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:53,851
Every touchdown,
in the back of my mind,

681
00:25:53,853 --> 00:25:57,021
I always wondered, what would
my dad think about this?

- Hey.

685
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:12,269
I was just on my way
to the bridge.

686
00:26:12,271 --> 00:26:13,604
- No, wait.

687
00:26:13,606 --> 00:26:15,973
Wait, please.

688
00:26:15,975 --> 00:26:17,141
I didn't mean to be a lurker,

689
00:26:17,143 --> 00:26:20,010
But I heard you
and sara talking.

690
00:26:20,012 --> 00:26:22,846
And I get it.
You thought I was dying.

691
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:24,682
You told me
what I needed to hear.

692
00:26:24,684 --> 00:26:26,083
And it worked.

693
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:29,053
So if you need a reason,

694
00:26:29,055 --> 00:26:30,287
A way to let me down easy--

695
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:31,889
- Ray, no.

696
00:26:31,891 --> 00:26:33,791
I want to be with you.

697
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:39,897
It's just that I know
that we can't last.

698
00:26:39,899 --> 00:26:41,165
- Says who?

699
00:26:41,167 --> 00:26:44,134
- Me.

700
00:26:44,136 --> 00:26:48,772
The woman I met in 1871...

701
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:50,274
Was me.

702
00:26:50,276 --> 00:26:52,643
And she warned me

703
00:26:52,645 --> 00:26:54,645
That it would end
in heartbreak

704
00:26:54,647 --> 00:26:56,780
If I ever tried
to be with someone--

705
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:59,650
- Other than carter.

706
00:26:59,652 --> 00:27:01,852
- God, this is just too
complicated.

707
00:27:01,854 --> 00:27:05,856
- No, it isn't, really.

708
00:27:05,858 --> 00:27:08,225
I mean, if I make you happy,

709
00:27:08,227 --> 00:27:09,727
If being with me
makes you happy,

710
00:27:09,729 --> 00:27:12,262
Then you can be happy.

711
00:27:12,264 --> 00:27:15,599
Or you can choose to listen
to some former version

712
00:27:15,601 --> 00:27:19,603
Of yourself
who believes in curses.

713

728
00:27:58,177 --> 00:27:59,209
- Dad!

729
00:27:59,211 --> 00:28:01,011

<i>And die because of you.</i>

<i>Unless you surrender</i>

741
00:28:35,748 --> 00:28:38,148
That the pilgrim's transmission
included a carrier frequency

742
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,783
Through which
she can be contacted?

743
00:28:39,785 --> 00:28:40,918
<i>- Yes, captain.</i>

744
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,653

745
00:28:42,655 --> 00:28:43,821

<i>- Captain hunter.</i>

747
00:28:45,124 --> 00:28:46,223
- Look, I'm gonna
make this easy.

748
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:47,791
<i>- I already have.</i>

749
00:28:47,793 --> 00:28:49,226
<i>The lives</i>

00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:50,994
<i>And dearest</i>

751
00:28:50,996 --> 00:28:52,730

With an offer of my own.

753
00:28:54,867 --> 00:28:56,366
I will surrender myself

754
00:28:56,368 --> 00:28:59,903
If you spare the lives
of my crew and their loved ones.

755
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:01,271
<i>- A noble gesture.</i>

756
00:29:01,273 --> 00:29:03,207
<i>But worthless.</i>

757
00:29:03,209 --> 00:29:07,344
<i>My directive is to eliminate</i>
<i>your entire team, not just you.</i>

758
00:29:07,346 --> 00:29:11,682
- Yes, well,
I'm not talking about me now.

759
00:29:11,684 --> 00:29:13,751
I'm offering you me in the past.

Enough people have died

767
00:29:35,074 --> 00:29:37,474
Gideon will send you

And, mr. Snart, your wish

You're going to meet

- What is this place?
- Neutral ground.

772
00:29:50,089 --> 00:29:52,222
It's a defunct
time masters outpost.

773
00:29:52,224 --> 00:29:54,892
- I thought we were supposed to
be picking up your younger self.

774
00:29:54,894 --> 00:29:57,194
- He's being brought
to us, actually.

776
00:29:59,865 --> 00:30:03,500

He's you.

778
00:30:06,372 --> 00:30:08,005
- You got my message?

779
00:30:08,007 --> 00:30:11,008
- I don't approve
of what you're planning.

780
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:13,043
Not that it ever
stopped you before.

781

Your younger selves
are all still safe and sound.

782
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:17,781
- Thank you.

783
00:30:17,783 --> 00:30:18,949

786
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:27,024
- I think it's probably
about time that you left.

787
00:30:27,026 --> 00:30:30,427
- Give her hell.

788
00:30:30,429 --> 00:30:32,062
- Where's my dad?

789
00:30:32,064 --> 00:30:35,032
- On board my ship,
along with the rest.

All in perfect condition...

791
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:39,469
As long as your captain
honors his end of our bargain.

792
00:30:39,471 --> 00:30:40,771
- You'd murder a child?

793
00:30:40,773 --> 00:30:42,072
- I'd murder as many children

794
00:30:42,074 --> 00:30:43,907
As is necessary
to accomplish my mission.

795
00:30:43,909 --> 00:30:45,843
- Do you know what this will do
to the timeline,

796
00:30:45,845 --> 00:30:46,910
Killing a time master?

797
00:30:46,912 --> 00:30:48,111
- In case you've forgotten,

798
00:30:48,113 --> 00:30:50,380
I am sanctioned
by the time masters

799
00:30:50,382 --> 00:30:52,916
To do what my former colleague
chronos here failed to do.

800
00:30:52,918 --> 00:30:54,251

806
00:31:06,498 --> 00:31:08,165

00:31:08,167 --> 00:31:09,433
- Before you do that,

808
00:31:09,435 --> 00:31:12,135
We don't believe
for a second

809
00:31:12,137 --> 00:31:14,004
Their loved ones
are on your ship.

810
00:31:14,006 --> 00:31:16,440
- A show of good faith, then.

811
00:31:16,442 --> 00:31:18,408
A prisoner exchange.

812
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:20,878
Send the boy,
and I'll send the father.

813
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,213
Once I have the future
captain hunter in my possession,

814
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:26,850
Then I'll release the rest.

I was a cutpurse

Starved more than I ate.

you didn't forget your roots.

00:34:32,071 --> 00:34:33,470
I've tried.

But the omega protocol
is still in effect.

870

- I'll look after your friends,
don't worry.

872
00:34:56,028 --> 00:34:58,228
You did the same for me.

873
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,496
- It must be strange

874
00:34:59,498 --> 00:35:01,264
For you to see yourself
as you were.

875
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:02,699

you were here?

877
00:35:04,703 --> 00:35:06,403

I tried to steal your purse.

God, I was a mean
little bastard.

- Well, you were surviving.

881
00:35:13,645 --> 00:35:17,080
- I was home.

882
00:35:17,082 --> 00:35:19,683
- Which is why I know
you'll be back.

Another "don't burn down
the house" speech?

886
00:35:33,832 --> 00:35:35,599
- You think by hurting yourself,
it's gonna

887
00:35:35,601 --> 00:35:37,834
Make you feel better
about the fire?

888
00:35:37,836 --> 00:35:39,603
- You don't know anything
about me, man.

889
00:35:39,605 --> 00:35:41,471
- Guess again, kid.

890
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:42,606
I'm you.

891
00:35:42,608 --> 00:35:44,307
- What?

892
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:47,511
- That's right.

893
00:35:47,513 --> 00:35:50,113
You're too young to understand.

894
00:35:50,115 --> 00:35:52,149
But understand this.

895
00:35:52,151 --> 00:35:53,450
It wasn't your fault.

â™ª

897
00:35:58,423 --> 00:36:00,524
- I let that flame
get out of control,

898
00:36:00,526 --> 00:36:02,592
Like you said.

899
00:36:02,594 --> 00:36:07,330
I ran out without
waking anybody, like you said.

900
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:10,367
I was just so afraid.

901
00:36:10,369 --> 00:36:13,703
- You were just a kid.

902
00:36:13,705 --> 00:36:17,240
I spent my whole life
blaming you,

903
00:36:17,242 --> 00:36:21,144
Hating you for something
you didn't mean to do.

904
00:36:21,146 --> 00:36:22,846
â™ª

905
00:36:22,848 --> 00:36:24,447
- Why are you telling me this?

906
00:36:24,449 --> 00:36:26,883
â™ª

907
00:36:26,885 --> 00:36:29,619
- You can't change the things
you did.

908
00:36:29,621 --> 00:36:31,655
But you can change
what you become.

909
00:36:31,657 --> 00:36:33,823
â™ª

910
00:36:33,825 --> 00:36:36,159
Don't be like me.

911
00:36:36,161 --> 00:36:37,494
Be better.

912
00:36:37,496 --> 00:36:41,498
â™ª

913
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,366
- Clarissa, it's me, martin.

914
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:44,634
- I'm sorry,
you look so familiar,

915
00:36:44,636 --> 00:36:45,835
But I just can't place you.

916
00:36:45,837 --> 00:36:48,505
- Spaceship?

917
00:36:48,507 --> 00:36:49,806
What next, martians?

918
00:36:49,808 --> 00:36:52,742
- No, actually, amnesia pill.

919
00:36:52,744 --> 00:36:54,277
- Oh, yeah.

920
00:36:54,279 --> 00:36:56,746
- This will just
wipe your short-term memory.

921
00:36:56,748 --> 00:36:58,582
Of course, it's up to you,
but we don't want

922
00:36:58,584 --> 00:37:01,651
To mess with time too much.

923
00:37:01,653 --> 00:37:04,588
- Mmm.

924
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:06,289
I always knew
that you'd end up

925
00:37:06,291 --> 00:37:08,758
Caring for people,

926
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,361
Protecting people.

927
00:37:11,363 --> 00:37:13,763
- Well,
I learned it from my dad.

928
00:37:13,765 --> 00:37:16,733
â™ª

929
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:17,767
- Proud of you, honey.

930
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:24,541
â™ª

931
00:37:24,543 --> 00:37:27,477
- Is everything all right?

932
00:37:27,479 --> 00:37:29,913
- My wife
doesn't seem to remember me.

933
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:31,948
- Because until we return
your younger selves

934
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:34,184
To the timeline, you--

935
00:37:34,186 --> 00:37:36,586
None of you will
have ever existed.

936
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:38,521
But we will return you.

937
00:37:38,523 --> 00:37:40,357
- When we left 2016,

938
00:37:40,359 --> 00:37:43,293
I just assumed I would return
to the exact moment I left,

939
00:37:43,295 --> 00:37:45,462
That clarissa wouldn't even know
I was gone.

940
00:37:45,464 --> 00:37:48,965
So I didn't say good-bye.

941
00:37:48,967 --> 00:37:51,601
And now I fear I will never
have that chance.

942
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:52,602
- You will.

943
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:54,271
Look, I've told you before

944
00:37:54,273 --> 00:37:56,673
That I am not going
to risk your marriage

945
00:37:56,675 --> 00:37:58,475
In order to save my wife.

946
00:37:58,477 --> 00:38:00,944
I promise you that.

947
00:38:00,946 --> 00:38:02,746
- Thank you.

948
00:38:02,748 --> 00:38:04,781
- Not even gonna pretend
to understand any of this.

949
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:06,850
- It's pretty crazy, huh?

950
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:11,821
- That was you in the hospital,

951
00:38:11,823 --> 00:38:14,624
On the day you were born.

952
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:17,927
And earlier, on fire.

953
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:19,262
Amazing.

954
00:38:19,264 --> 00:38:21,531
Where'd you learn those moves?

955
00:38:21,533 --> 00:38:22,966
- From my dad.

956
00:38:22,968 --> 00:38:25,635
â™ª

957
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:28,505
- You know, the day
you were born in the hospital,

958
00:38:28,507 --> 00:38:30,473
I'd never been so scared.

959
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:33,376
I mean, even in combat.

960
00:38:33,378 --> 00:38:37,514
But now, I know
for you to be the man

961
00:38:37,516 --> 00:38:41,384
I see standing here,
I must do something right.

962
00:38:41,386 --> 00:38:43,586
I can't wait to be there
to watch it happen.

963
00:38:43,588 --> 00:38:46,022
â™ª

964
00:38:46,024 --> 00:38:48,358
- Dad, listen.

965
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,393
On September 26th,

966
00:38:50,395 --> 00:38:52,629
You're gonna be deployed
along the k4 circle.

967
00:38:52,631 --> 00:38:55,398
Keep your head
on a swivel for an ied.

968
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,868
- You know this beca--

969
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:00,637
You're from the future.

970
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:03,406
- Please.
Promise me you'll be careful.

971
00:39:03,408 --> 00:39:10,580
â™ª

972
00:39:10,582 --> 00:39:12,816
- I'll be back soon, okay?

973
00:39:12,818 --> 00:39:17,620
â™ª

974
00:39:17,622 --> 00:39:18,755
Hey.

975
00:39:18,757 --> 00:39:20,824
- Hey.

976
00:39:20,826 --> 00:39:24,594
- Hope you don't mind,
my fiancÃ©e...

977
00:39:24,596 --> 00:39:27,931
My other fiancÃ©e
is in our quarters, resting.

978
00:39:27,933 --> 00:39:30,667
- Yeah, no, that's...
That's fine.

979
00:39:30,669 --> 00:39:31,668
- Hey, I'm sorry.

980
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:33,336
- No, really, it's fine.

981
00:39:33,338 --> 00:39:35,305
- No, I-I mean,

982
00:39:35,307 --> 00:39:36,673
Being at death's door

983
00:39:36,675 --> 00:39:39,509
Is not the right time
to pop the question.

984
00:39:39,511 --> 00:39:42,946
- Look, when you proposed,

985
00:39:42,948 --> 00:39:45,415
I was so afraid of losing you.

986
00:39:45,417 --> 00:39:47,016
And then facing the pilgrim,

987
00:39:47,018 --> 00:39:50,553
I realized there is never
going to be

988
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:52,088
A right time for this.

989
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:56,359
So we should stop waiting
for the right time.

990
00:39:57,828 --> 00:39:58,828
- I don't understand.

991
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:05,902
â™ª

992
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:09,606
- I want to marry you, ray.

993
00:40:09,608 --> 00:40:11,841
I mean it.

994
00:40:11,843 --> 00:40:17,614
â™ª

995
00:40:17,616 --> 00:40:19,783
- How's your sister?

996
00:40:19,785 --> 00:40:20,850
- She's a tough kid.

997
00:40:20,852 --> 00:40:22,352
How's your dad?

998
00:40:22,354 --> 00:40:24,921
- Sleeping off that amnesia pill
from rip.

999
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:27,557
â™ª

1000
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:30,393
- Hey.

1001
00:40:30,395 --> 00:40:31,661
I might have just stopped my dad

1002
00:40:31,663 --> 00:40:33,797
From getting killed
in mogadishu.

1003
00:40:33,799 --> 00:40:35,465
I just thought I should tell you

1004
00:40:35,467 --> 00:40:37,767
In case there's
a time paradox or whatever.

1005
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:40,470
- Well, as I've been saying, mr.
Jackson, time wants to happen.

1006
00:40:40,472 --> 00:40:42,839
- Yeah, I know.
But I had to try.

1007
00:40:42,841 --> 00:40:45,575
- And perhaps
what time wants

1008
00:40:45,577 --> 00:40:48,378
Is to see you
and your father back together.

1009
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:50,013
â™ª

1010
00:40:50,015 --> 00:40:51,781
- Ugh.

1011
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:54,918
Just pulled younger me's head
from out of his ass.

1012
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,386
- I'm not sure it stuck.

1013
00:40:56,388 --> 00:40:57,854
- Me either.

1014
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:59,155
Then I saw younger rip change,

1015
00:40:59,157 --> 00:41:00,957
And I thought,
why not give it a shot?

1016
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:03,059
- Surprised you didn't advise
your teenage self

1017
00:41:03,061 --> 00:41:04,928
To not get on a certain boat.

1018
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:06,963
- Yeah, me too.
- Yak, yak, yak.

1019
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:08,631
I thought we were
on a clock here.

1020
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:10,533
- Indeed we are.

1021
00:41:10,535 --> 00:41:11,935
Time, the history

1022
00:41:11,937 --> 00:41:15,972
From which your younger selves
were removed,

1023
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:20,844
Is beginning to set...

1024
00:41:20,846 --> 00:41:22,178
As is evidenced by the change

1025
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,780
In clarissa's memory.
- Okay.

1026
00:41:23,782 --> 00:41:25,648
So how long do we have till
these changes stick?

1027
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:26,883
- No one knows.

1028
00:41:26,885 --> 00:41:28,051
- Which is why we need
to move swiftly

1029
00:41:28,053 --> 00:41:29,752
To locate vandal savage

1030
00:41:29,754 --> 00:41:31,955
If any of your lives
are to be restored to normal.

1031
00:41:31,957 --> 00:41:33,523
- So how long
will it take to determine

1032
00:41:33,525 --> 00:41:34,657
A new location for savage?

1033
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:35,992
- Longer than we have.

1034
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:38,094
Fortunately, there is
one place in time

1035
00:41:38,096 --> 00:41:40,096
That we know savage to be.

1036
00:41:40,098 --> 00:41:42,632
- You said he conquered
the world in 2166.

1037
00:41:42,634 --> 00:41:44,434
- You also said
it was too dangerous

1038
00:41:44,436 --> 00:41:46,169
To strike at savage while he was
at the height of his powers.

1039
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:47,871
- That it is.

1040
00:41:47,873 --> 00:41:50,974
But with your younger selves
removed from history,

1041
00:41:50,976 --> 00:41:55,745
We have quite literally
run out of time.

1042
00:41:55,747 --> 00:41:57,547
â™ª

1043
00:42:19,737 --> 00:42:21,104
<i>- Greg, move your head!</i>
