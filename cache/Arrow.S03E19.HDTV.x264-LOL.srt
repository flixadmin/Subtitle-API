1
00:00:00,467 --> 00:00:01,787
Previously, on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:01,788 --> 00:00:05,394
You have but two choices--
ascend to the calling of Ra's al Ghul,

3
00:00:05,395 --> 00:00:07,251
or you will spend
the rest of your days

4
00:00:07,252 --> 00:00:08,885
in a cage.

5
00:00:08,886 --> 00:00:09,886
I love you.

6
00:00:09,937 --> 00:00:10,887
Wow.

7
00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:11,954
Lance knows.

8
00:00:11,956 --> 00:00:13,282
The whole city knows, Oliver.

9
00:00:13,283 --> 00:00:16,458
Mr. Queen should be considered armed
and highly dangerous.

10
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:20,023
Captain Lance...

11
00:00:20,024 --> 00:00:21,657
I'm here
to turn myself in.

12
00:00:22,933 --> 00:00:23,810
What the hell
are your men doing?

13
00:00:23,811 --> 00:00:25,978
I told them to stand down.
Get down on the ground!

14
00:00:25,979 --> 00:00:28,580
You've got the wrong guy.
Oliver Queen isn't the Arrow.

15
00:00:30,848 --> 00:00:31,848
I am.

16
00:00:37,967 --> 00:00:39,909
Bethany Snow: To repeat,
we're just getting word

17
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:41,842
from the authorities
that Roy Harper,

18
00:00:41,844 --> 00:00:45,346
a Glades resident with a long history
of run-ins with the police,

19
00:00:45,348 --> 00:00:48,082
has been identified as the vigilante
known as the Arrow...

20
00:00:50,586 --> 00:00:53,520
What the hell
was that?

21
00:00:53,522 --> 00:00:54,755
Probably just
a power surge.

22
00:00:56,392 --> 00:00:58,392
That wasn't a power
surge. Check it out.

23
00:00:58,394 --> 00:01:00,594
Bethany: There were earlier reports
implicating Oliver Queen,

24
00:01:00,596 --> 00:01:02,463
now appear...

25
00:01:40,735 --> 00:01:43,737
Bethany: ...Transported
to SCPD by police caravan,

26
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:46,006
and should be
arriving imminently.

27
00:01:46,008 --> 00:01:49,476
We're now going live
to the SCPD.

28
00:01:49,478 --> 00:01:51,779
All right, let's go.
Get him, come on.

29
00:01:51,781 --> 00:01:53,781
All right, bring him,
come on, come on.

30
00:01:53,783 --> 00:01:55,783
Is it safe to assume you're calling off
the manhunt for Queen?

31
00:01:55,785 --> 00:01:57,284
No comment.
Come on, bring him through.

32
00:02:13,943 --> 00:02:15,969
You proud of yourself?
Letting the kid take the fall?

33
00:02:15,971 --> 00:02:17,771
I'm not going
to let him do that.

34
00:02:17,773 --> 00:02:19,506
Give me a pen and paper,
I will sign a full confession.

35
00:02:19,508 --> 00:02:23,177
Oliver, not another word.
Uncuff him.

36
00:02:23,179 --> 00:02:24,511
Sure,
in 25 to life.

37
00:02:24,513 --> 00:02:26,613
More like right now.
Habeas writ.

38
00:02:26,615 --> 00:02:28,582
The district
attorney's office

39
00:02:28,584 --> 00:02:30,250
won't be pursuing
charges against Oliver Queen

40
00:02:30,252 --> 00:02:32,519
while it's charging
Roy Harper with the same crime.

41
00:02:32,521 --> 00:02:34,688
Nice try. Five hours ago,
Queen turned himself in.

42
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:35,823
He confessed!

43
00:02:35,825 --> 00:02:38,525
To you, alone
and uncorroborated.

44
00:02:38,527 --> 00:02:39,827
And then the Arrow
turned himself in.

45
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:41,929
Your so-called
confession

46
00:02:41,931 --> 00:02:43,497
is looking rather
fabricated right about now.

47
00:02:43,499 --> 00:02:44,531
That's just crap.

48
00:02:44,533 --> 00:02:46,266
The D.A. is
ordering Oliver

49
00:02:46,268 --> 00:02:48,702
to be released.
Are you the only one

50
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:50,504
who's allowed to put themselves
above the law?

51
00:02:56,111 --> 00:02:57,845
This isn't over.

52
00:03:03,885 --> 00:03:06,386
What the hell are you doing?

53
00:03:06,388 --> 00:03:10,057
I'm just making sure you.
both don't end up in prison.

54
00:03:21,503 --> 00:03:22,903
Ray: Hey.

55
00:03:22,905 --> 00:03:24,171
What are you doing here?

56
00:03:24,173 --> 00:03:26,206
Proofing the quarterly
earnings report.

57
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:28,742
And finalizing the subsonic ionizer
patent application,

58
00:03:28,744 --> 00:03:30,043
and I'm trying to debug
the sequential--

59
00:03:30,045 --> 00:03:33,413
I mean, what are you
doing here?

60
00:03:34,145 --> 00:03:36,550
Oliver and Roy Harper
are both in handcuffs.

61
00:03:36,552 --> 00:03:38,519
I have a lot
of work to do.

62
00:03:38,521 --> 00:03:40,053
And Oliver was released.

63
00:03:40,055 --> 00:03:42,089
How do you know
about Roy Harper?

64
00:03:42,091 --> 00:03:44,191
Apart from it being plastered
all over the television,

65
00:03:44,193 --> 00:03:46,426
I'm able to put one
and one together,

66
00:03:46,428 --> 00:03:48,729
and I get that
Oliver's sister's boyfriend

67
00:03:48,731 --> 00:03:50,631
is obviously
part of your team.

68
00:03:50,633 --> 00:03:51,899
Obviously.

69
00:03:51,901 --> 00:03:52,795
You ok?

70
00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:54,235
Yes.

71
00:03:55,231 --> 00:03:56,738
How are you?

72
00:03:56,739 --> 00:03:58,372
Pss, yeah.

73
00:03:58,374 --> 00:04:01,742
Let's--let's not
get into that. Uh...

74
00:04:01,744 --> 00:04:03,310
I said "I love you,"

75
00:04:03,312 --> 00:04:06,480
but it was like, heh,
it was like with a lowercase "l,"

76
00:04:06,482 --> 00:04:10,551
you know, not, um, so
let's not make it a thing.

77
00:04:10,553 --> 00:04:13,720
Um...You know,
you had just saved my life,

78
00:04:13,722 --> 00:04:16,890
I had 6.2 billion nano-robots
coursing through my epithalamus,

79
00:04:16,892 --> 00:04:19,893
and my emotions were
a little all over the place.

80
00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:26,333
Well, I'll let you get back
to work-slash-worry,

81
00:04:26,335 --> 00:04:28,435
and, um...

82
00:04:28,437 --> 00:04:30,437
Keep a good thought for Roy.

83
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:32,906
Ok.

84
00:04:49,357 --> 00:04:51,458
What were you thinking,

85
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:55,262
Roy?

86
00:04:55,264 --> 00:04:57,231
Tell me why.

87
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:02,502
Do you remember what I told you
when I found out you were the Arrow?

88
00:05:02,504 --> 00:05:05,472
Yeah. You told me
I saved your life.

89
00:05:05,474 --> 00:05:07,241
Now I get
to save yours.

90
00:05:07,243 --> 00:05:08,842
I can't let you do that.

91
00:05:08,844 --> 00:05:10,344
Oliver, ever since
I found out

92
00:05:10,346 --> 00:05:11,745
that I killed that cop,

93
00:05:11,747 --> 00:05:14,414
I have been trying
to make it right as Arsenal.

94
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:18,385
But maybe what I need
to do is make it right as the Arrow.

95
00:05:18,387 --> 00:05:19,178
No, Roy...

96
00:05:19,202 --> 00:05:20,622
I killed a police offer.

97
00:05:20,623 --> 00:05:22,956
Mirakuru or not,
I should be punished for that.

98
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:24,891
I should be in prison.

99
00:05:24,893 --> 00:05:27,027
That won't bring
the officer back.

100
00:05:27,029 --> 00:05:29,529
This city still needs you.

101
00:05:29,531 --> 00:05:31,431
It needs you more.

102
00:05:32,338 --> 00:05:35,736
For the first time
since I remember what I did...

103
00:05:35,738 --> 00:05:39,106
I'm ok.

104
00:05:47,315 --> 00:05:48,915
You sure
this place is safe?

105
00:05:48,917 --> 00:05:51,385
Safe as I can manage.

106
00:05:51,387 --> 00:05:52,619
Who's that?

107
00:05:52,621 --> 00:05:54,993
Someone eager
to repay a debt.

108
00:05:54,994 --> 00:05:56,028
Ok, but for how long?

109
00:05:56,052 --> 00:05:57,792
Waller has men all over
Hong Kong looking for us.

110
00:05:57,793 --> 00:05:59,860
Even if we could make
it out of the city,

111
00:05:59,862 --> 00:06:02,195
there's nowhere we could run where
Waller won't find us.

112
00:06:02,815 --> 00:06:05,400
So, what are
we going to do?

113
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:09,069
I'm going
to find Waller first.

114
00:06:09,071 --> 00:06:11,204
You're going to break
into A.R.G.U.S. by yourself?

115
00:06:11,206 --> 00:06:12,773
No.

116
00:06:12,775 --> 00:06:14,508
He's going
to walk in.

117
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:18,011
My passcard
to the field office.

118
00:06:30,318 --> 00:06:31,558
What do you want?

119
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,428
Setting Harper up as your patsy.
I applaud the gamble--

120
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:37,331
I had nothing to do
with Roy turning himself in...

121
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,766
But I will
get him out.

122
00:06:39,768 --> 00:06:41,961
And then what?
Ra's won't stop

123
00:06:41,962 --> 00:06:44,702
until you're wearing
the Demon's Head ring on your hand.

124
00:06:44,703 --> 00:06:45,739
It's not going
to happen.

125
00:06:45,741 --> 00:06:47,174
People are being murdered.

126
00:06:47,176 --> 00:06:49,676
Your days as the Arrow
are finished.

127
00:06:49,678 --> 00:06:52,212
But of course, no one
close to you has died.

128
00:06:52,214 --> 00:06:55,082
Have you considered that
leading the League of Assassins

129
00:06:55,084 --> 00:06:57,851
might be a preferable outcome
as to what alternatives

130
00:06:57,853 --> 00:06:59,720
Ra's might devise?

131
00:06:59,722 --> 00:07:01,588
I have a lot
of work to do.

132
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:04,758
I'm going to break
Roy out of prison.

133
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:08,762
Ironically, before
turning to vigilantism,

134
00:07:08,764 --> 00:07:10,530
Harper was
a career criminal,

135
00:07:10,532 --> 00:07:12,699
with an arrest record
for breaking and entering,

136
00:07:12,701 --> 00:07:15,969
petty theft, and grand
larceny. Until recently--

137
00:07:15,971 --> 00:07:18,939
Thea...

138
00:07:18,941 --> 00:07:20,774
Please tell me it wasn't you
that put him up to this.

139
00:07:20,776 --> 00:07:22,175
Of course not,
but I'm going to do

140
00:07:22,177 --> 00:07:24,811
everything in my power
to make it right.

141
00:07:24,813 --> 00:07:25,542
Are you ok?

142
00:07:25,566 --> 00:07:26,414
I'm fine,

143
00:07:26,415 --> 00:07:27,914
but we need to get
Roy out of prison.

144
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:29,750
Well, it looks like we might have
another problem

145
00:07:29,752 --> 00:07:31,351
to add to our
ever-growing list.

146
00:07:31,353 --> 00:07:33,420
Bethany: ...Multiple
homicide at Starling National Bank.

147
00:07:33,422 --> 00:07:36,990
Channel 52 has acquired
surveillance footage of the incident...

148
00:07:36,992 --> 00:07:39,259
Makes sense.
As a bank-robbing meta-human,

149
00:07:39,261 --> 00:07:41,762
why stay in Central City when you have
plenty of banks and no Arrow?

150
00:07:41,764 --> 00:07:44,531
Ok. Ok,
we need a plan

151
00:07:44,533 --> 00:07:47,267
to extract Roy.
In the meantime,

152
00:07:47,269 --> 00:07:49,436
Felicity, call
S.T.A.R. Labs,

153
00:07:49,438 --> 00:07:51,438
see if they're tracking any meta-humans
that have left Central City.

154
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,774
SCPD. According
to city records,

155
00:07:53,776 --> 00:07:55,409
you got a basement
down here.

156
00:07:55,411 --> 00:07:56,576
You already have
Roy Harper in custody.

157
00:07:56,578 --> 00:07:58,445
Yeah, and I got
a warrant that says

158
00:07:58,447 --> 00:08:00,447
I can search
that basement.

159
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:02,249
Sorry for the rush,

160
00:08:02,251 --> 00:08:03,250
but I didn't want
to give you a chance

161
00:08:03,252 --> 00:08:04,384
to turn that place

162
00:08:04,386 --> 00:08:05,919
into a storage
room again.

163
00:08:05,921 --> 00:08:07,988
Gentlemen.

164
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:13,794
Here you go.
Break it down.

165
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:39,019
I got you now,
you son of a bitch.

166

168
00:08:57,862 --> 00:09:00,363
Oh, uh, my Chinese
is a little rusty,

169
00:09:00,365 --> 00:09:02,665
but this looks like a crate from
the North China Sea.

170
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,434
You've spent some
time there, right?

171
00:09:04,436 --> 00:09:06,102
And this is my favorite.

172
00:09:06,104 --> 00:09:08,805
You actually put those
things on display?

173
00:09:08,807 --> 00:09:11,074
Captain, we have
fingerprint matches

174
00:09:11,076 --> 00:09:13,309
for the latents we lifted
off all this equipment.

175
00:09:13,311 --> 00:09:15,078
Hold that thought.

176
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,413
What do you got?

177
00:09:16,415 --> 00:09:18,748
We only got one match.

178
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,949
What is it?

179
00:09:19,951 --> 00:09:20,719
Roy Harper.

180
00:09:20,743 --> 00:09:22,453
Roy--

181
00:09:22,454 --> 00:09:24,788
just--

182
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,890
Uh, did you check
the other computers?

183
00:09:26,892 --> 00:09:28,958
Captain Lance,
it's clear--

184
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,428
Shut up! Whatever line of crap
you're thinking about giving me,

185
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:32,862
you just save it.

186
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:34,264
Smart as you all are,

187
00:09:34,266 --> 00:09:36,466
you are bound to make
a mistake eventually.

188
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:40,503
And I'm going to be there
when it happens.

189
00:09:50,147 --> 00:09:52,482
You wiped the entire place?

190
00:09:52,484 --> 00:09:54,933
And moved some of your more
sensitive trunk items. You're welcome.

191
00:09:54,934 --> 00:09:56,920
But you didn't wipe
Roy's prints.

192
00:09:56,922 --> 00:09:57,832
Oliver, Roy
already confessed.

193
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:59,191
We didn't see any point in
losing both of you.

194
00:09:59,192 --> 00:10:00,577
I'm not losing Roy.

195
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:01,657
What about that meta-human

196
00:10:01,658 --> 00:10:03,291
that is out there
killing people?

197
00:10:03,292 --> 00:10:05,859
We need to grab
my back-up weapons cache

198
00:10:05,861 --> 00:10:06,927
in the secondary layer.

199
00:10:06,929 --> 00:10:08,098
You see those
plainclothes?

200
00:10:08,099 --> 00:10:09,933
Lance will have them follow you
everywhere you go.

201
00:10:09,934 --> 00:10:11,934
You try to nab even so much as
a purse snatcher,

202
00:10:11,936 --> 00:10:13,235
and they'll pounce.

203
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:14,970
Somebody needs
to protect this city.

204
00:10:14,972 --> 00:10:18,240
We are dealing with a meta-human.
Call Barry.

205
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:20,008
Oh, he can't help
right now, mm-mmm.

206
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:21,977
He's got on a lot on his plate with
Dr. Wells, I think.

207
00:10:21,979 --> 00:10:24,046
It's really hard
to keep up with him.

208
00:10:24,048 --> 00:10:27,983
But...What if there's someone else
that could help?

209
00:10:31,244 --> 00:10:33,489
Oh, hey, Felicity,
check this out.

210
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:35,490
I finally got
the neural network online,

211
00:10:35,492 --> 00:10:39,094
so when my brain tells
the gauntlet to wave, and...

212
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:40,115
Hi.

213
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,297
Hi.

214
00:10:41,298 --> 00:10:43,131
Sorry to hear about
what's happening to you.

215
00:10:43,133 --> 00:10:44,766
Uh, if there's anything
I can do to help...

216
00:10:44,768 --> 00:10:46,048
Well, actually,
that's why we're here.

217
00:10:46,049 --> 00:10:46,627
Oh.

218
00:10:46,651 --> 00:10:47,337
You know how I try

219
00:10:47,338 --> 00:10:48,904
to keep my work life

220
00:10:48,906 --> 00:10:51,373
and my other work
life separate.

221
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:53,775
I meant to tell you that.
Did I tell you that?

222
00:10:53,777 --> 00:10:55,510
Well, there's a--
there's a meta

223
00:10:55,512 --> 00:10:57,346
in Starling City
that's killing people.

224
00:10:57,348 --> 00:10:59,201
A meta, as in human?

225
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:00,225
Yeah.

226
00:11:01,422 --> 00:11:03,052
So, obviously
we need to catch this

227
00:11:03,053 --> 00:11:05,487
plasma death thing guy.

228
00:11:05,489 --> 00:11:07,356
Ugh, now I see why Cisco
gives them all names.

229
00:11:07,358 --> 00:11:09,591
The police are
all over Oliver,

230
00:11:09,593 --> 00:11:11,894
so...we need you.

231
00:11:11,896 --> 00:11:13,629
And you're ok with this?

232
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:16,265
We need your help.

233
00:11:16,267 --> 00:11:19,501
So it's
a team up. High-five!

234
00:11:34,617 --> 00:11:37,252
Don't shoot!
What the hell is going on?

235
00:11:37,254 --> 00:11:40,923
They've been
holding me here for weeks.

236
00:11:44,128 --> 00:11:47,162
What, you don't
trust me?

237
00:11:50,634 --> 00:11:53,335
Look at him.

238
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:55,470
He's army,
not A.R.G.U.S.

239
00:11:55,472 --> 00:11:57,172
Oh, so you're saying
this is General Shrieve?

240
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:59,374
He held me hostage.

241
00:11:59,376 --> 00:12:01,343
Targeted you
and the Yamashiros,

242
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:02,978
for death.

243
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:05,247
Why would he do that?
The Alpha omega.

244
00:12:05,249 --> 00:12:08,383
Shrieve plans
to unleash it on Hong Kong,

245
00:12:08,385 --> 00:12:10,719
claiming that
the Triad mishandled

246
00:12:10,721 --> 00:12:13,322
a bio weapon they never
should have had.

247
00:12:13,324 --> 00:12:14,656
That's insane.

248
00:12:14,658 --> 00:12:16,491
Well, Shrieve
seems to think that

249
00:12:16,493 --> 00:12:20,128
China is a military
and economic threat.

250
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:22,597
So he'd kill himself
and his men

251
00:12:22,599 --> 00:12:24,566
just to hurt China?

252
00:12:24,568 --> 00:12:26,401
His team has
developed a vaccine

253
00:12:26,403 --> 00:12:28,770
they can inoculate
themselves with.

254
00:12:32,009 --> 00:12:33,909
Run.

255
00:12:33,911 --> 00:12:36,645
Get as far away
from Hong Kong as you can.

256
00:12:36,647 --> 00:12:38,580
If you make it...

257
00:12:38,582 --> 00:12:41,249
I hope we meet
again someday.

258
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,161
Inmate: You better watch
your back in here, hood.

259
00:12:56,866 --> 00:13:00,035
Second inmate: You're dead,
Arrow, you're dead.

260
00:13:22,058 --> 00:13:24,693
How are you?

261
00:13:26,829 --> 00:13:29,664
I told the guards
I didn't want to see you.

262
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:32,334
Why?

263
00:13:33,469 --> 00:13:35,537
Roy, please.

264
00:13:35,539 --> 00:13:37,906
Tell me what is going on.

265
00:13:42,278 --> 00:13:44,212
When we got
back together,

266
00:13:44,214 --> 00:13:47,015
hell, even before
that, I...

267
00:13:47,017 --> 00:13:51,420
I made a promise to myself that
I would never lie to you again.

268
00:13:51,422 --> 00:13:53,922
Ok.

269
00:13:53,924 --> 00:13:56,758
That's why I didn't
want to see you.

270
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,761
I don't want to break
that promise.

271
00:14:00,576 --> 00:14:03,131
Why would you?

272
00:14:04,173 --> 00:14:05,036
Roy!

273
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,335
Thea...

274
00:14:06,336 --> 00:14:10,572
Thea, please just...

275
00:14:10,574 --> 00:14:14,076
Know that I'm
going to be fine.

276
00:14:15,711 --> 00:14:18,480
Is that a lie?

277
00:14:35,565 --> 00:14:37,399
Oliver: Thea, don't worry.

278
00:14:37,401 --> 00:14:40,569
Roy's not going to be
in there much longer.

279
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:42,805
I'm working on it.

280
00:14:42,806 --> 00:14:44,005
Bye.

281
00:14:44,007 --> 00:14:44,738
Roy holding up?

282
00:14:44,762 --> 00:14:45,775
For now.

283
00:14:45,776 --> 00:14:47,275
Hot off the presses.

284
00:14:47,277 --> 00:14:48,677
What are those?

285
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,545
I visited
the bank today.

286
00:14:50,547 --> 00:14:52,013
Uh, manager's
a friend of mine.

287
00:14:52,015 --> 00:14:53,381
I beat him at squash
every Tuesday.

288
00:14:53,383 --> 00:14:55,517
And I took a few photos
of the crime scene.

289
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,052
Actually, "photos"
is a bit reductive

290
00:14:57,054 --> 00:14:58,887
these are enhanced
resonance scans.

291
00:14:58,889 --> 00:15:00,255
It occurred to me that
if we can't see his face

292
00:15:00,257 --> 00:15:02,524
because
of the radiation,

293
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:04,693
we need to remove
the radiation.

294
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:07,229
Oh, I could kiss you
right now. Awkward, sorry.

295
00:15:07,231 --> 00:15:09,164
Boundaries.
We're working on it.

296
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:14,402
So, if we interlace the
resonant scan's frequency with our

297
00:15:14,404 --> 00:15:16,338
news footage,
we get this.

298
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,138
There he is.

299
00:15:17,162 --> 00:15:18,441
Run a facial recognition.

300
00:15:18,442 --> 00:15:20,675
Way ahead of you.
Jake Simmons.

301
00:15:20,677 --> 00:15:22,244
He's already in the system.

302
00:15:22,246 --> 00:15:24,479
Serial bank robber,
which explains Starling National.

303
00:15:24,481 --> 00:15:26,047
Last known address,

304
00:15:26,049 --> 00:15:26,927
Central City.

305
00:15:26,951 --> 00:15:28,251
Where is he now?

306
00:15:28,252 --> 00:15:31,019
He was last seen
on a traffic camera

307
00:15:31,021 --> 00:15:33,121
at the corner
of Gantner and Yount.

308
00:15:33,123 --> 00:15:34,923
There's a processing
plant there;

309
00:15:34,925 --> 00:15:36,247
he went in, never came out.

310
00:15:36,272 --> 00:15:37,227
On it.

311
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:38,693
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
hold on a second.

312
00:15:38,695 --> 00:15:40,061
I thought the whole point
of this team-up

313
00:15:40,063 --> 00:15:42,631
was you not being spotted
out as a vigilante.

314
00:15:42,633 --> 00:15:44,266
Stop calling it
a team-up, Ray.

315
00:15:44,268 --> 00:15:46,101
This Jake Simmons
is not just a meta-human,

316
00:15:46,103 --> 00:15:48,970
he is a killer.
And you're not ready for that.

317
00:15:48,972 --> 00:15:51,239
Look, I'm--I'm not going to try to
equate our experiences,

318
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:53,775
but superpowers
are based in science,

319
00:15:53,777 --> 00:15:56,077
and I am a man
of science.

320
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,113
So if there's any way
to defeat this guy,

321
00:15:58,115 --> 00:16:00,415
I'm the one who's best able
to figure it out.

322
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:02,751
Fine.

323
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:04,452
The second that you get in
over your head...

324
00:16:04,454 --> 00:16:06,288
I'll run.

325
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:08,623
Fly, probably.

326
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:23,838
Ray: How many abandoned
warehouses do you think are in this city?

327
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,540
No, no, I'm--I'm
genuinely curious.

328
00:16:25,542 --> 00:16:26,841
Oliver: Stay
focused, Ray.

329
00:16:26,843 --> 00:16:28,510
Maybe Simmons
isn't in there.

330
00:16:28,512 --> 00:16:30,612
Do you get this anxious
when I'm out in the field?

331
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:32,814
I honestly can't think of an answer
to that question

332
00:16:32,816 --> 00:16:34,449
that doesn't
get me in trouble.

333
00:16:36,859 --> 00:16:38,186
Still nothing.

334
00:16:38,188 --> 00:16:41,122
Not a visual sighting or any
other reading at all from the atom.

335
00:16:41,124 --> 00:16:42,724
And when I say atom,
I mean the suit,

336
00:16:42,726 --> 00:16:44,292
not myself
in the third person.

337
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:45,560
There's a decent chance

338
00:16:45,562 --> 00:16:48,430
that you and Palmer
are related.

339
00:16:53,473 --> 00:16:55,538
Well, that's
equally fascinating

340
00:16:55,539 --> 00:16:57,639
and terrifying.

341
00:16:57,641 --> 00:17:01,109
Be my eyes, Ray,
what's going on?

342
00:17:01,111 --> 00:17:05,247
Oh, tin man?
You shouldn't be here.

343
00:17:05,249 --> 00:17:07,582
Actually, I should.
See, you're the bad guy,

344
00:17:07,584 --> 00:17:09,517
and I am--

345
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,254
Ray?!

346
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,228
Thanks for the top off.

347
00:17:24,467 --> 00:17:26,134
Ray!

348
00:17:41,751 --> 00:17:44,586
Felicity: Ray,
where are you?

349
00:17:44,588 --> 00:17:47,451
Ray, Ray!

350
00:17:54,978 --> 00:17:57,245
Oh, my God, Ray,
are you hurt?

351
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,913
Heh, "hurt" would be
a step or two up

352
00:17:58,915 --> 00:18:00,715
from how I feel right now.

353
00:18:00,717 --> 00:18:03,017
But...just a second.

354
00:18:04,987 --> 00:18:07,388
You're lucky to have gotten
out of there alive.

355
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:09,190
It wasn't that
bad, was it?

356
00:18:09,192 --> 00:18:10,524
It was way worse, Ray.

357
00:18:10,526 --> 00:18:11,378
Right.

358
00:18:11,402 --> 00:18:12,661
I need shields!

359
00:18:12,662 --> 00:18:15,396
That's not the answer.
You need to anticipate

360
00:18:15,398 --> 00:18:16,764
your opponent.

361
00:18:16,766 --> 00:18:17,899
You need to trust
your instincts

362
00:18:17,901 --> 00:18:19,667
and not just
your tech.

363
00:18:19,669 --> 00:18:21,402
My instinct
is to trust my tech.

364
00:18:21,404 --> 00:18:23,437
Ray, when I'm out in the field,
my bow, my arrows,

365
00:18:23,439 --> 00:18:25,373
those are just tools.

366
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:26,624
I'm the weapon.

367
00:18:26,648 --> 00:18:28,010
That's poetic.

368
00:18:28,011 --> 00:18:30,444
My point is that
if you rely on that suit

369
00:18:30,446 --> 00:18:33,481
more than you rely
on yourself...

370
00:18:33,483 --> 00:18:35,683
It's going
to get you killed.

371
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,260
So when is Shrieve going
to distribute the virus?

372
00:18:46,262 --> 00:18:48,863
I don't know. If he's going to pin it
on the Triad, though,

373
00:18:48,865 --> 00:18:50,364
he'll have
to do it soon.

374
00:18:50,366 --> 00:18:52,199
We need to get out
of Hong Kong.

375
00:18:52,201 --> 00:18:55,269
My contact says Shrieve
has men everywhere,

376
00:18:55,271 --> 00:18:57,972
with even more resources
at his disposal than Waller ever had.

377
00:18:57,974 --> 00:19:01,976
Shrieve has assured
we won't get off this island alive.

378
00:19:06,748 --> 00:19:08,950
Well, if we can't run,
Waller said Shrieve

379
00:19:08,952 --> 00:19:10,584
had a vaccine
for the virus.

380
00:19:10,586 --> 00:19:12,620
You want to steal
some of the vaccine?

381
00:19:12,622 --> 00:19:14,889
He has to have it
somewhere in Hong Kong.

382
00:19:40,649 --> 00:19:43,351
Get down!

383
00:19:46,022 --> 00:19:48,823
Let's see how good you are
without your arrows.

384
00:19:48,825 --> 00:19:50,658
Good enough.

385
00:20:15,117 --> 00:20:17,585
Just remember--
that was without arrows.

386
00:20:19,055 --> 00:20:20,788
Get down, on the floor!

387
00:20:29,531 --> 00:20:31,866
All right, turn this
place inside out.

388
00:20:31,868 --> 00:20:35,236
We know how this guy loves
his secret hiding places.

389
00:20:35,238 --> 00:20:36,837
Hey, Frank.

390
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:38,873
What brings you out
of your downtown office?

391
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:40,708
The Chief of D's asked me
to have a word with you.

392
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:43,778
Yeah?
What about?

393
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,613
He wants to know
why you're still going Ahab

394
00:20:45,615 --> 00:20:48,716
on Oliver Queen when we got
a different suspect already in custody.

395
00:20:48,718 --> 00:20:51,052
We got a patsy in custody. Trust me,
Queen is our guy.

396
00:20:51,054 --> 00:20:53,521
Well, there's no evidence
against Queen.

397
00:20:53,523 --> 00:20:55,222
Why do you think
I'm searching his condo?

398
00:20:55,224 --> 00:20:56,624
Friend to friend--

399
00:20:56,626 --> 00:20:59,193
you've come so far.
You're a captain.

400
00:20:59,195 --> 00:21:03,497
Don't throw all your hard work
away on something personal.

401
00:21:11,107 --> 00:21:13,641
Look, I don't know what
it is you think that you're going to find,

402
00:21:13,643 --> 00:21:16,310
but it's not here.
There's nothing here!

403
00:21:16,312 --> 00:21:18,746
Kind of like how there was
nothing in the basement of your club?

404
00:21:18,748 --> 00:21:21,282
You're either complicit or just about
the most naive girl I ever met.

405
00:21:21,284 --> 00:21:23,784
You know that your brother
is letting your boyfriend

406
00:21:23,786 --> 00:21:26,053
rot in prison
for his crimes, right?

407
00:21:26,055 --> 00:21:28,789
Get out of my home.

408
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:33,594
I know you went
to visit Harper yesterday.

409
00:21:33,596 --> 00:21:35,362
Does he even know why
he's throwing his life away?

410
00:21:38,468 --> 00:21:41,235
Lance.

411
00:21:41,237 --> 00:21:43,804
Is he all right?

412
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:47,675
All right,
I'll be right there.

413
00:21:47,677 --> 00:21:51,412
Your boyfriend
was just attacked.

414
00:21:51,414 --> 00:21:55,015
He's all right, but I can't imagine
it'll be the last time.

415
00:21:55,017 --> 00:21:57,485
Your brother dropped
a lot of bodies.

416
00:21:57,487 --> 00:22:00,955
And when, and it's not if, it is
when Roy gets a shiv in the back,

417
00:22:00,957 --> 00:22:03,023
that body will be on him, too.

418
00:22:08,396 --> 00:22:10,131
The suit recorded
over ten terabytes of data,

419
00:22:10,133 --> 00:22:12,233
which were uploaded
in real time

420
00:22:12,235 --> 00:22:13,734
to a geosynchronous
satellite.

421
00:22:13,736 --> 00:22:15,069
That is a huge
energy suck.

422
00:22:15,071 --> 00:22:16,403
This is all fascinating.

423
00:22:16,405 --> 00:22:18,372
How do we find Simmons?
Light bulb, literally.

424
00:22:18,374 --> 00:22:19,807
I--no, actually,
figuratively.

425
00:22:19,809 --> 00:22:23,611
Uh, just
before Simmons beat me,

426
00:22:23,613 --> 00:22:26,080
I blasted him with my
compressed light beams,

427
00:22:26,082 --> 00:22:28,182
and he thanked me
for topping him off.

428
00:22:28,184 --> 00:22:30,417
He absorbs energy and turns it into
weaponized plasma.

429
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:32,253
And if we can manually get into
the city's power grid,

430
00:22:32,255 --> 00:22:35,089
we might be able to track where he's
getting his extra juice.

431
00:22:36,525 --> 00:22:39,160
Thea: Ollie!

432
00:22:40,562 --> 00:22:41,962
What's going on?

433
00:22:41,964 --> 00:22:43,397
It's Roy!

434
00:22:43,399 --> 00:22:45,866
He was attacked
by a bunch of inmates.

435
00:22:45,868 --> 00:22:49,970
He's fine, but there's
hundreds of them in there!

436
00:22:53,108 --> 00:22:54,808
I'm going
to break him out.

437
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:58,078
Oliver. You can end up
in a cell right next to him.

438
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,446
John, if you know
what's good for you,

439
00:22:59,448 --> 00:23:00,981
you'll get out
of my way.

440
00:23:00,983 --> 00:23:02,483
Oliver, if you know
what's good for you--

441
00:23:02,485 --> 00:23:04,952
and for Roy--you're going
to need to stay put.

442
00:23:04,954 --> 00:23:05,508
I can't do that.

443
00:23:05,532 --> 00:23:06,254
Oliver, listen--

444
00:23:06,255 --> 00:23:08,055
Get your hands
off of me!

445
00:23:08,057 --> 00:23:09,523
Listen, I know what
you're going through, man!

446
00:23:09,525 --> 00:23:11,325
You have to rely on Palmer
to take care of this meta

447
00:23:11,327 --> 00:23:13,160
while Roy sits in a prison.

448
00:23:13,162 --> 00:23:15,563
But listen to me, man--
you have to throttle this back,

449
00:23:15,565 --> 00:23:18,399
Oliver. You have to.

450
00:23:18,401 --> 00:23:20,834
Before you lose everything.

451
00:23:23,338 --> 00:23:26,507
I've already lost
everything.

452
00:23:28,837 --> 00:23:30,611
I'm not going
to lose Roy.

453
00:23:48,249 --> 00:23:49,684
Oliver!

454
00:23:49,685 --> 00:23:51,768
I can't believe
that you and Diggle are ok

455
00:23:51,769 --> 00:23:53,635
just sitting
on your hands while Roy

456
00:23:53,637 --> 00:23:55,302
fights off all of Iron Heights!

457
00:23:55,326 --> 00:23:56,206
It is not that simple!

458
00:23:56,207 --> 00:23:58,474
No, Felicity,
if anything was ever simple,

459
00:23:58,476 --> 00:23:59,808
it's this.

460
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:02,111
Then what? You're
going to jail, too?

461
00:24:02,113 --> 00:24:04,713
I can't just do nothing.

462
00:24:04,715 --> 00:24:06,215
I think John's right.

463
00:24:06,217 --> 00:24:07,950
I think you're struggling
with doing nothing;

464
00:24:07,952 --> 00:24:10,352
with Roy, with Ray,
but right now,

465
00:24:10,354 --> 00:24:15,324
you need people to help you.
You need to let them.

466
00:24:15,326 --> 00:24:17,359
Maybe...there is
something more

467
00:24:17,361 --> 00:24:20,028
going on with you than just what's
happening with Roy

468
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:22,097
and this meta-human.

469
00:24:22,099 --> 00:24:25,934
You have sacrificed
everything to be the Arrow.

470
00:24:25,936 --> 00:24:29,505
Even you and me.

471
00:24:29,507 --> 00:24:31,306
But...

472
00:24:31,308 --> 00:24:35,010
Whether or not you break Roy
out of Iron Heights,

473
00:24:35,012 --> 00:24:38,881
there is no more Arrow.

474
00:24:38,883 --> 00:24:42,184
Ra's took that
from you.

475
00:24:43,753 --> 00:24:45,888
I was told once that a man

476
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:49,758
cannot live by two names.

477
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,760
Well, right now,

478
00:24:51,762 --> 00:24:55,898
I can't live by either.

479
00:24:56,794 --> 00:24:58,901
So I don't know who I am.

480
00:24:58,903 --> 00:25:00,235
I know who you are.

481
00:25:00,237 --> 00:25:02,104
Whether you're
in a--in a suit

482
00:25:02,106 --> 00:25:05,007
or under a hood,
you're the man that I...

483
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:11,281
You're the man
that I believe in.

484
00:25:15,401 --> 00:25:16,852
Uh, Ray finished
the transponder.

485
00:25:16,854 --> 00:25:18,921
I have to upload it
to a power source

486
00:25:18,923 --> 00:25:21,523
and, uh, hopefully it'll bring us
right to Simmons.

487
00:25:21,525 --> 00:25:22,416
I'll go with you.

488
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,359
It is adorable

489
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,561
how you keep forgetting
that Lance is after you,

490
00:25:25,563 --> 00:25:27,396
but, uh, it's a quick errand

491
00:25:27,398 --> 00:25:31,533
and you need practice
in letting people help you.

492
00:25:44,132 --> 00:25:45,280
You sure this is it?

493
00:25:45,282 --> 00:25:47,349
It doesn't look like
a typical army base.

494
00:25:47,351 --> 00:25:50,586
Matthew Shrieve isn't
a typical army general, apparently.

495
00:25:54,023 --> 00:25:56,425
Quiet!

496
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:58,599
Where's the vaccine?

497
00:25:59,969 --> 00:26:01,396
You can end up
unconscious

498
00:26:01,398 --> 00:26:03,732
or you can
end up dead.

499
00:26:04,947 --> 00:26:06,134
Two lefts,

500
00:26:06,136 --> 00:26:08,103
second door on your right.

501
00:26:08,105 --> 00:26:09,605
Good choice.

502
00:26:19,647 --> 00:26:20,415
Somebody coming.

503
00:26:20,417 --> 00:26:21,450
10 seconds.

504
00:26:21,452 --> 00:26:23,118
Up there.

505
00:26:38,802 --> 00:26:40,102
Thank you.

506
00:26:40,104 --> 00:26:42,037
Can you give us
a minute?

507
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:43,772
I already signed
my confession.

508
00:26:43,774 --> 00:26:45,607
Yeah, it's a hell
of a story.

509
00:26:45,609 --> 00:26:47,776
All that stuff about
setting up shop

510
00:26:47,778 --> 00:26:49,678
under your
girlfriend's club.

511
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,980
And I particularly like how
you managed not to implicate her.

512
00:26:51,982 --> 00:26:53,148
What are you doing here?

513
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:54,816
You remember that, uh,

514
00:26:54,818 --> 00:26:55,984
that corpse
I showed you?

515
00:26:55,986 --> 00:26:57,586
The one that
the Arrow killed?

516
00:26:57,588 --> 00:27:00,055
I knew you had
an obsession with the Arrow.

517
00:27:00,057 --> 00:27:01,723
And, hey, I was trying
to wave you off

518
00:27:01,725 --> 00:27:02,991
'cause I knew,
just somehow I knew,

519
00:27:02,993 --> 00:27:05,060
that if you stayed
obsessed with him,

520
00:27:05,062 --> 00:27:07,262
that you would
come to a bad end.

521
00:27:11,934 --> 00:27:13,969
And here I am.

522
00:27:13,971 --> 00:27:16,338
Two years later, I'm still trying
to save you, son.

523
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:18,507
I don't need saving.

524
00:27:18,509 --> 00:27:20,642
Look, I know you got to be doing this
'cause you think you owe Queen something.

525
00:27:20,644 --> 00:27:22,477
But you don't.
You don't deserve to be here.

526
00:27:22,479 --> 00:27:24,780
Patrol officer Gabe Vincent

527
00:27:24,782 --> 00:27:27,949
left behind a wife
and a nine-year-old boy.

528
00:27:27,951 --> 00:27:30,385
I know.

529
00:27:30,387 --> 00:27:33,622
I killed him.

530
00:27:33,624 --> 00:27:36,058
I stabbed him in the chest
with an Arrow.

531
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:39,027
So don't think for a second
that I don't deserve to be here.

532
00:27:39,029 --> 00:27:41,630
No. You don't
think for a second

533
00:27:41,632 --> 00:27:46,802
that what you're doing here makes up
for any of at you did out there.

534
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,374
Guard.

535
00:28:21,338 --> 00:28:23,105
I'm sorry, miss,

536
00:28:23,107 --> 00:28:25,107
but I don't think
you're supposed to be here.

537
00:28:25,109 --> 00:28:27,776
I'm supposed to access
your grid for the city.

538
00:28:27,778 --> 00:28:29,344
Think you can help?

539
00:28:29,346 --> 00:28:32,180
Sure.
It's this way.

540
00:28:32,182 --> 00:28:33,348
Thank you.

541
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:35,517
So, uh,

542
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:37,352
what's with
the sunglasses, man?

543
00:28:37,354 --> 00:28:39,421
We're indoors
and it's, well, night.

544
00:28:39,423 --> 00:28:41,146
Do you have a sensitivity
to the--

545
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:42,191
To light?

546
00:28:42,192 --> 00:28:44,192
No.

547
00:28:50,136 --> 00:28:52,100
I love the light.

548
00:28:58,114 --> 00:28:59,581
Do you think the plan to find
Simmons will work?

549
00:28:59,583 --> 00:29:01,650
Well, it's Felicity,
so, yes.

550
00:29:01,652 --> 00:29:06,405
Heh. Except the tracking
firmware seems to be malfunctioning.

551
00:29:06,406 --> 00:29:07,022
What?

552
00:29:07,046 --> 00:29:08,373
It's not a malfunction.

553
00:29:08,374 --> 00:29:09,706
It's Simmons.
He's drawing energy

554
00:29:09,707 --> 00:29:10,860
directly from a power station.

555
00:29:10,884 --> 00:29:12,243
Which one?

556
00:29:12,244 --> 00:29:13,444
The one Felicity
just went to.

557
00:29:13,446 --> 00:29:16,280
Come on, Felicity,
pick up.

558
00:29:16,282 --> 00:29:19,116
I'm sorry, but the blonde can't
come to the phone at the moment.

559
00:29:19,118 --> 00:29:20,818
I swear to God,
if you hurt her--

560
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:24,688
You'll what...
fly away again?

561
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:27,524
I am talking
to the man in the suit,

562
00:29:27,526 --> 00:29:30,461
right? The one who thinks a piece
of scrap metal

563
00:29:30,463 --> 00:29:33,464
makes him some
kind of hero?

564
00:29:33,466 --> 00:29:35,899
It doesn't.

565
00:29:35,901 --> 00:29:38,335
I am sorry
for the interruption.

566
00:29:38,337 --> 00:29:39,737
Where were we?

567
00:29:39,739 --> 00:29:42,906
Waiting for you
to come closer.

568
00:29:49,147 --> 00:29:51,248
Diggle...

569
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:52,850
Oliver, you can't go out there.
It's Felicity!

570
00:29:52,852 --> 00:29:54,451
Oliver, you won't
make it in time.

571
00:29:54,453 --> 00:29:55,719
Power station is still
eight minutes away

572
00:29:55,721 --> 00:29:56,920
going 60 on the Ducati.

573
00:29:56,922 --> 00:29:58,596
But the Atom?
Well, the Atom can fly.

574
00:29:58,597 --> 00:30:00,825
You need more than
your tech this time!

575
00:30:00,826 --> 00:30:02,192
You're right.

576
00:30:02,194 --> 00:30:04,394
My tech and your instinct,

577
00:30:04,396 --> 00:30:07,030
maybe there's
a way we can get him.

578
00:30:11,169 --> 00:30:12,970
Ok, I'm entering
the power station now.

579
00:30:12,972 --> 00:30:14,638
Activate the link.

580
00:30:18,944 --> 00:30:22,246
It's working! Oh,
I'm just a passenger now.

581
00:30:22,248 --> 00:30:24,181
Ooh. Let's get this guy.

582
00:30:33,925 --> 00:30:35,359
Sorry.

583
00:30:35,361 --> 00:30:37,494
But I have
to kill you now.

584
00:30:37,496 --> 00:30:39,997
No, and you're going
to leave her the hell alone.

585
00:30:39,999 --> 00:30:41,899
Kick his ass.

586
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:46,770
You ok?

587
00:30:46,772 --> 00:30:48,739
You got to get out of here!

588
00:30:48,741 --> 00:30:49,873
No! I'm not going
to leave you here alone.

589
00:30:49,875 --> 00:30:51,575
Ray, get her
out of there!

590
00:30:51,577 --> 00:30:52,977
I'm not alone,
but I can't fight him

591
00:30:52,978 --> 00:30:53,716
and worry about you,
now, go, Felicity!

592
00:30:53,717 --> 00:30:54,203
No!

593
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:55,412
Felicity, go!

594
00:30:55,414 --> 00:30:57,347
Get out of here!

595
00:30:57,349 --> 00:30:59,683
I'm really hoping
you played video games as a kid.

596
00:30:59,685 --> 00:31:00,561
I'm trying to concentrate.

597
00:31:00,584 --> 00:31:01,885
Sorry, sorry,

598
00:31:01,887 --> 00:31:03,327
it's just, I'm trusting
you with my--

599
00:31:12,831 --> 00:31:15,465
Ray, can you take this beating?
I can pull you back.

600
00:31:15,467 --> 00:31:17,701
I'm fine. Get this bastard!

601
00:31:26,511 --> 00:31:28,378
Ray, I've lost control.

602
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:30,747
The transmitter's been severed.

603
00:31:33,117 --> 00:31:34,751
Get up.

604
00:31:34,753 --> 00:31:36,620
Get up, Ray!

605
00:31:42,393 --> 00:31:45,028
Fight back, Ray,
fight back! Ray!

606
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:46,997
He's too strong!

607
00:31:46,999 --> 00:31:48,599
This is not about strength.

608
00:31:48,601 --> 00:31:50,434
This is about heart.

609
00:31:50,436 --> 00:31:51,969
When the mayor was killed,

610
00:31:51,971 --> 00:31:53,837
you put yourself
in harm's way to save Felicity.

611
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:55,372
Normal people,
they don't do that.

612
00:31:55,374 --> 00:31:58,809
Heroes do that.
Fight back!

613
00:31:58,811 --> 00:32:00,844
Come on, Ray!

614
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:09,987
Take him out, Ray.

615
00:32:22,301 --> 00:32:24,301
Oh, I'm sorry, sorry!

616
00:32:24,303 --> 00:32:25,669
No, it was
totally worth it.

617
00:32:25,671 --> 00:32:28,572
Felicity: Are you ok?
I was so worried.

618
00:32:28,574 --> 00:32:32,576
Ray: I'm fine.
Everything's ok now.

619
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:46,690
Guard: Eyes front, Harper.

620
00:32:57,035 --> 00:32:58,568
I told you, eyes front.

621
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:00,037
My instincts are
to keep my head on a swivel.

622
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:01,571
Won't happen again.

623
00:33:01,573 --> 00:33:03,273
No, it won't.

624
00:33:23,561 --> 00:33:25,996
Thea?

625
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,002
It's Roy.

626
00:33:33,338 --> 00:33:36,807
Harper was killed
an hour ago.

627
00:33:41,412 --> 00:33:43,580
I'd say I'm sorry,
but I think we both know

628
00:33:43,582 --> 00:33:45,916
whose fault this is.

629
00:34:24,034 --> 00:34:27,469
I shouldn't have listened
to either of you.

630
00:34:30,473 --> 00:34:34,410
I might not have been
able to save Roy...

631
00:34:37,247 --> 00:34:39,309
But I'd feel better right now
if I tried.

632
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:42,078
We know that, Oliver.

633
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,812
We also know you may
never forgive us.

634
00:34:43,814 --> 00:34:46,981
I make my own
choices, John.

635
00:34:46,983 --> 00:34:49,350
I made this one.

636
00:34:49,352 --> 00:34:51,486
He doesn't mean
forgive us for that.

637
00:34:51,488 --> 00:34:53,788
He means...

638
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:56,257
forgive us for this.

639
00:35:04,642 --> 00:35:06,201
How?

640
00:35:06,203 --> 00:35:08,770
Don't be mad at them.
This was my idea.

641
00:35:08,772 --> 00:35:10,839
If any one of us were
in there and Oliver was here,

642
00:35:10,841 --> 00:35:12,974
he would think of something.
You're right.

643
00:35:19,193 --> 00:35:22,784
If one of us deserves
to go to prison, it's me.

644
00:35:22,786 --> 00:35:24,752
Roy, we can't allow
you to do that.

645
00:35:24,754 --> 00:35:26,754
There's no way in hell Oliver's
going along with it.

646
00:35:26,756 --> 00:35:29,324
That's why you're not
going to tell him.

647
00:35:29,326 --> 00:35:33,528
You could have
gotten yourself killed for real.

648
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:37,365
I figured that I could hold off
until Dig's guys got into position.

649
00:35:37,367 --> 00:35:41,102
One of Lyla's contacts,
an A.R.G.U.S. freelancer.

650
00:35:41,104 --> 00:35:45,273
Has a special talent for knifing people
in just the right way.

651
00:35:45,275 --> 00:35:48,143
Leaves a convincing
amount of blood without the kill.

652
00:35:48,145 --> 00:35:51,679
He laces the blade with a beta blocker,
crawl the heartbeat.

653
00:35:51,681 --> 00:35:53,481
Gives the illusion of death.

654
00:35:53,483 --> 00:35:55,150
Everyone thinks
the Arrow is dead.

655
00:35:55,152 --> 00:35:58,720
Which means
Oliver Queen is innocent.

656
00:35:58,722 --> 00:36:02,423
You did all this
without asking.

657
00:36:02,425 --> 00:36:05,527
How many times have you
saved one of us without asking?

658
00:36:05,529 --> 00:36:08,129
This time we had to save you.

659
00:36:09,398 --> 00:36:13,535
If everyone thinks
you're dead...

660
00:36:13,537 --> 00:36:16,504
Then what happens
to Roy Harper?

661
00:36:21,977 --> 00:36:26,381
Tell Thea, well, tell her
I'm alive, first.

662
00:36:26,383 --> 00:36:28,783
Then tell her that I'm sorry I had
to leave without saying good-bye.

663
00:36:28,785 --> 00:36:30,151
I feel like you're throwing
your life away.

664
00:36:30,153 --> 00:36:31,753
I'm not.

665
00:36:31,755 --> 00:36:33,855
I'm starting
a new one.

666
00:36:36,825 --> 00:36:38,993
Anywhere,
any time.

667
00:36:38,995 --> 00:36:42,430
You need something,
you call me.

668
00:36:43,312 --> 00:36:45,733
Take care of yourself, Roy.

669
00:36:49,438 --> 00:36:51,773
I'll miss you most
of all, Scarecrow.

670
00:36:53,776 --> 00:36:55,543
Just be ready to get
a million calls

671
00:36:55,545 --> 00:36:57,378
on that untraceable
satellite phone

672
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,813
I stuffed
in your bag.

673
00:37:06,722 --> 00:37:08,356
Thank you.

674
00:37:11,126 --> 00:37:12,860
Thank you.

675
00:37:31,647 --> 00:37:33,648
So, on a scale
of one to ten,

676
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:37,151
how...mad at us are you?

677
00:37:37,153 --> 00:37:39,954
I need to learn
to let people help me.

678
00:37:39,956 --> 00:37:42,590
Yeah.

679
00:37:42,592 --> 00:37:45,326
You could use
the practice in that.

680
00:37:45,328 --> 00:37:48,663
I just think sometimes
you're so focused

681
00:37:48,665 --> 00:37:51,933
on people you love,
you forget...

682
00:37:51,935 --> 00:37:54,602
to see that there are people
who love you.

683
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:35,209
Just enough
innoculant for us.

684
00:38:35,211 --> 00:38:36,911
And Akio.

685
00:38:36,913 --> 00:38:38,546
What about her?

686
00:38:38,548 --> 00:38:40,848
We need to inject Akio
and ourselves

687
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:43,751
and then the three of you
need to get somewhere safe.

688
00:38:43,753 --> 00:38:45,320
And what about you?

689
00:38:45,322 --> 00:38:46,854
I lifted this when
I took the vaccine.

690
00:38:46,856 --> 00:38:48,723
And clearly, it belongs
to one of Shrieve's men,

691
00:38:48,725 --> 00:38:51,793
because it has the plans for how
they are going to distribute the virus.

692
00:38:51,795 --> 00:38:53,361
I'm going to use it
to stop them.

693
00:38:53,363 --> 00:38:56,097
No. You won't.

694
00:38:56,099 --> 00:38:57,236
We are.

695
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,300
Tatsu!

696
00:38:58,301 --> 00:39:00,101
What example are we
setting for our son

697
00:39:00,103 --> 00:39:02,870
if we have a hope to save
millions of innocent people,

698
00:39:02,872 --> 00:39:03,938
but only save ourselves?

699
00:39:03,939 --> 00:39:04,487
Listen to me--

700
00:39:04,488 --> 00:39:06,642
the two of you need
to take care of Akio.

701
00:39:06,643 --> 00:39:08,543
I am not going
to be responsible--

702
00:39:08,545 --> 00:39:11,846
You need to learn
to let people help you.

703
00:39:11,848 --> 00:39:14,048
And Maseo and I are going to.

704
00:39:19,578 --> 00:39:21,389
What about...

705
00:39:21,391 --> 00:39:23,691
Deathbolt.

706
00:39:23,693 --> 00:39:25,827
Nice!

707
00:39:25,829 --> 00:39:27,528
Mmm. You know,
you're the only other person

708
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:30,331
who's good at the names.

709
00:39:30,333 --> 00:39:32,533
So, uh, how do
they get fed?

710
00:39:32,535 --> 00:39:34,736
And, you know,
complete the transaction,

711
00:39:34,738 --> 00:39:36,204
so to speak?

712
00:39:38,207 --> 00:39:40,274
Cisco?

713
00:39:40,276 --> 00:39:43,244
You said Simmons
is from Central City, right?

714
00:39:43,246 --> 00:39:44,846
Yeah. Last known address,

715
00:39:44,848 --> 00:39:47,849
4160 Dixon Canyon. Why?

716
00:39:47,851 --> 00:39:50,485
According to this,
Jake Simmons was a guest

717
00:39:50,487 --> 00:39:52,153
of the Opal City
police department

718
00:39:52,155 --> 00:39:53,221
on December 11th,
2013.

719
00:39:53,223 --> 00:39:55,156
What do I know that date from?

720
00:39:55,158 --> 00:39:57,892
That was the date
of the particle accelerator test.

721
00:39:57,894 --> 00:40:01,062
But if Simmons
wasn't in Central City

722
00:40:01,064 --> 00:40:04,499
the night of the dark matter
explosion, then...

723
00:40:04,501 --> 00:40:07,602
How can he be
a meta-human?

724
00:40:41,685 --> 00:40:44,172
Do you know
who I am, child?

725
00:40:45,032 --> 00:40:46,506
You're the Demon.

726
00:40:46,507 --> 00:40:48,340
I am the Demon's Head.

727
00:40:49,394 --> 00:40:51,995
As those were before me,

728
00:40:51,996 --> 00:40:54,864
and very soon,
your brother.

729
00:40:54,865 --> 00:40:56,765
He will never take your place.

730
00:40:56,767 --> 00:40:58,900
He will.

731
00:40:58,902 --> 00:41:01,136
Once I've given him
sufficient motivation.

732
00:41:01,138 --> 00:41:03,538
Oh, my brother's
going to kill you!

733
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:05,874
No.

734
00:41:05,876 --> 00:41:08,143
He's going to beg me.

735
00:42:02,154 --> 00:42:08,654
