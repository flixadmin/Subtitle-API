ANYTHING FURTHER,
MS. LANCE?

456
00:23:14,352 --> 00:23:19,273
YOUR HONOR, THE HARDEST
THING TO DO IS TO BE A HERO

457
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:21,650
WHEN NO ONE EXPECTS
YOU TO BE.

458
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:24,278
THE EASIER PATH
IS TO BE A CRIMINAL.

459
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,656
THE PAST 6 MONTHS,
OLIVER QUEEN HAS CHOSEN

460
00:23:27,698 --> 00:23:31,285
THE HARD ROAD AND HAS BEEN
A HERO IN TERRIBLE CONDITIONS,

461
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:34,872
AND SINCE THE FBI HAS NOT
HELD UP THEIR END OF THE DEAL,

462
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:38,042
OLIVER QUEEN DESERVES
TO BE A FREE MAN.

463
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:40,669
I AGREE THAT
A FEDERAL INVESTIGATION

464
00:23:40,711 --> 00:23:44,298
INTO THE CONDITIONS
OF SLABSIDE SHOULD BE ORDERED.

465
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:48,302
HOWEVER, I'M UNCONVINCED
THAT MR. QUEEN SHOULD BE
RELEASED AT THIS TIME.

466
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:50,428
THEREFORE,
HIS CONVICTION STANDS.

467
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,306
YOUR APPEAL IS DENIED.

468
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:53,640
[GAVEL BANGS]

469
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:57,519
GOT YOUR MESSAGE.
ARE YOU IN?

470
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:59,105
FELICITY HAD
THE BRILLIANT IDEA

471
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:00,689
TO USE A CYRILLIC
DICTIONARY ATTACK
ON THE TABLE

472
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:02,108
OF HASHED PASSWORDS.

473
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,859
IT WAS PRETTY
BRILLIANT OF ME.

474
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:05,652
OUR FRIEND ROSLOV,
ON THE OTHER HAND,
LESS BRILLIANT.

475
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:07,238
HIS DECRYPTION KEY
IS THE RUSSIAN EQUIVALENT

476
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,906
OF "PASSWORD69."

477
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:10,324
ONCE WE TRANSLATED
ALL THE DATA,

478
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:11,784
THIS IS WHAT WE GOT.

479
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:14,536
SAY HELLO TO BETAB-500.

480
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:16,163
JOHN: YEAH. THAT'S
A TOP-OF-THE-LINE
AERIAL EXPLOSIVE,

481
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:17,790
RAZOR-THIN PRECISION,

482
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:19,625
ABLE TO CUT THROUGH
CONCRETE LIKE NOTHING.

483
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,752
WELL, DIAZ HAS
TWO OF THEM,

484
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:23,337
SO THAT MEANS OUR
LIST OF POTENTIAL
TARGETS JUST DOUBLED.

485
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:24,797
KEEP WORKING
ON THAT HARD DRIVE.

486
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,340
WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO?

487
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:28,008
PREPARE FOR A MASS EVAC
OF STAR CITY.

488
00:24:34,765 --> 00:24:36,850
WHY'D YOU DO IT, TURNER?

489
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:38,436
WHAT THE HELL ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

490
00:24:38,476 --> 00:24:39,728
WHY'D YOU KILL DUNBAR?

491
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:41,188
I DIDN'T KILL
THAT GUARD.

492
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,773
YOUR BLADE SAYS YOU DID.

493
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,446
GUARDS FOUND
PRINTS ON IT.

494
00:24:48,486 --> 00:24:50,739
TURNER, YOU'RE GOING
TO THE HOLE,

495
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:53,200
AND THIS TIME,
YOU'RE NEVER
COMING OUT.

496
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:57,788
TURNER: YOU DID THIS?
W-WAIT. YOU GOT
THE WRONG GUY.

497
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,680
HEY. I HEARD
YOU WERE UP.

498
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:15,973
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

499
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:17,850
HEART POUNDING IN HEAD.

500
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:21,603
EACH BEAT...POW...
LIKE KNIFE TO BRAIN.

501
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:26,566
I'M SORRY. I SHOULD HAVE
GOTTEN YOU OUT SOONER.

502
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:29,862
SO YOU ARE NOT
NEW FELICITY SMOAK
AFTER ALL.

503
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:32,656
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

504
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:34,783
YOU WANT
TO BE RUTHLESS

505
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:36,327
TO PURSUE MADMAN,

506
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:38,078
I'LL NOT JUDGE YOU.

507
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,664
I AM, AFTER ALL,
WANTED CRIMINAL.

508
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:43,209
I ACTUALLY THOUGHT
YOU'D BE MORE PISSED
I ALMOST GOT YOU KILLED.

509
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,294
YEAH. OF COURSE
I'M ANGRY.

510
00:25:45,336 --> 00:25:46,962
YOU THREATEN
MY LIFE,

511
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:49,715
BUT I DON'T LIKE
APOLOGIES.

512
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:52,926
YOU CANNOT TAKE
AWAY MISTAKE
BY WISHING IT SO.

513
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:55,679
IN MY LINE OF WORK,
YOU MAKE CHOICE,

514
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:57,639
YOU DO NOT LOOK BACK.

515
00:25:57,681 --> 00:26:02,895
AH. SO YOU DON'T REGRET
WORKING AGAINST US
WITH DIAZ LAST YEAR?

516
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:09,735
REGRET, GUILT.
THESE ARE DEMONS YOU
CHOOSE TO LIVE WITH,

517
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:12,530
A TRADE YOU MAKE
TO GET WHAT YOU WANT.

518
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:14,823
HOW BAD DO YOU WANT
TO KILL RICARDO DIAZ?

519
00:26:14,865 --> 00:26:16,534
MORE THAN ANYTHING.

520
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:20,120
WELL, THEN YOU
EMBRACE DEMONS.

521
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:22,915
NO MORE HALF MEASURES.

522
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:26,419
WHEN I WORK WITH OLIVER
IN RUSSIA,

523
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,421
HE WAS NOT VILLAIN,

524
00:26:28,462 --> 00:26:31,924
BUT HE DID WHAT
NEEDED TO BE DONE.

525
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:34,552
YOU REMIND ME
OF HIM THEN.

526
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,933
WHAT WOULD THAT OLIVER
HAVE DONE IN THIS SITUATION?

527
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:43,685
HE WOULD HAVE ENDED
DIAZ,

528
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:46,230
AND HE WOULDN'T CARE
ABOUT THE COST.

529
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:01,995
DINAH: HEY! LAUREL,
YOU LOOK A LITTLE UPSET.

530
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:03,539
WHY DON'T WE GO
COOL OFF?

531
00:27:03,581 --> 00:27:05,040
GET OUT OF MY WAY.

532
00:27:05,082 --> 00:27:07,501
IT SEEMS LIKE YOU WERE
ABOUT TO OPEN YOUR MOUTH

533
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:09,420
AND DO SOMETHING
YOU'RE GOING TO
REGRET, COUNSELOR.

534
00:27:09,462 --> 00:27:11,255
I'M NOT AN ATTORNEY,

535
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:13,591
AS YOU'VE REMINDED ME
MANY TIMES.

536
00:27:13,631 --> 00:27:15,342
YOU SURE LOOKED LIKE ONE
IN THAT COURTROOM TODAY.

537
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:17,886
YEAH. WELL, IT DOESN'T
MATTER, DOES IT?

538
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:19,930
OLIVER'S NOT GETTING
OUT OF PRISON.

539
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:21,557
NOW, IF YOU DON'T MIND,
I HAVE

540
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:24,017
SOME UNFINISHED BUSINESS
WITH THAT JUDGE.

541
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:26,312
DID YOU EVEN BOTHER TO
LISTEN TO YOURSELF IN COURT?

542
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:28,397
YOU SPOKE
FROM YOUR HEART.

543
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:30,441
BIG SURPRISE, BY THE WAY,
YOU DO HAVE ONE.

544
00:27:30,483 --> 00:27:32,568
YOU SAID, "THE HARDEST
THING TO DO WAS TO BE A HERO

545
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:34,612
"WHEN NO ONE
EXPECTS YOU TO BE.

546
00:27:34,652 --> 00:27:36,947
THE EASIER PATH
IS TO BE A CRIMINAL."

547
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:38,824
WHAT DO YOU
CARE, ANYWAY?

548
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:42,328
IF ANYBODY KNOWS
THE TRUE ME,
THE REAL ME,

549
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:44,330
IT'S YOU.

550
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:46,332
YOU KNOW, YOU'VE BEEN
TELLING PEOPLE
FOR 6 MONTHS NOW

551
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:47,874
YOU'VE CHANGED.

552
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:50,002
IT WASN'T UNTIL I SAW
YOU IN THAT COURTROOM

553
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:52,754
THAT I ACTUALLY
BELIEVED IT.

554
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:57,343
DO NOT THROW THAT AWAY
JUST BECAUSE IT'S
GETTING HARD NOW.

555
00:27:57,384 --> 00:28:02,389
I DON'T WANT YOU COMING
TO ONE OF MY COURT
APPEARANCES EVER AGAIN.

556
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:14,067
WILLIAM: THIS HAS TO BE
WHERE FELICITY WAS HIDING OUT.

557
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:16,236
DINAH: YEAH,
BUT DOING WHAT?

558
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:18,071
UH, GUYS.

559
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:20,491
VOICE ON P.A.: YOU HAVE
TRIGGERED SECURITY PROTOCOLS.

560
00:28:20,533 --> 00:28:23,035
IF YOU DO NOT PROVIDE
ACCESS CREDENTIALS

561
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:25,245
IN 30 SECONDS,

562
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:27,080
YOU WILL BE TERMINATED.

563
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:31,544
ALL OUR WEAPONS
WERE TARGETED.

564
00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:33,003
PLEASE SAY
YOU CAN HACK THIS.

565
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:34,505
HACK FELICITY?
YEAH, RIGHT!

566
00:28:34,547 --> 00:28:36,382
[BUZZER]

567
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:37,841
SHE WOULDN'T LEAD US HERE
WITHOUT ACCESS.

568
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:39,259
WHAT ARE THOSE?

569
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:46,850
NO FREAKIN' WAY.

570
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:48,227
GET THE BOW.

571
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,899
WILLIAM: REMEMBER HOW
MY DAD USED TO TRAIN?

572
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:09,415
VOICE ON P.A.:
ACCESS GRANTED.

573
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:13,001
ROY: YOU'D THINK FELICITY
WOULD HAVE MADE THAT
A LOT EASIER.

574
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:15,588
DINAH: SHE'S OBVIOUSLY
TRYING TO PROTECT SOMETHING.

575
00:29:15,629 --> 00:29:18,048
I'LL BRING UP
THE LAST FILES
SHE ACCESSED.

576
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:20,926
DINAH: THESE ARE
STRUCTURAL MAPS

577
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:22,928
OF ALL THE BUILDINGS
THROUGHOUT STAR CITY.

578
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:24,846
CITY HALL,
CENTRAL LIBRARY,

579
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:26,390
OLD ROCKETS ARENA...

580
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:27,974
ALL AREAS
OUTSIDE THE GLADES.

581
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,935
YEAH. ALONG WITH SCHEMATICS
TO BUILD EXPLOSIVES

582
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:31,729
AND THE MONEY
TO FUND IT.

583
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:40,696
THIS IS A PLAN TO LEVEL
ALL OF STAR CITY.

584
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,993
WHAT YOU GOT?

585
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:49,705
ANATOLY SAID IN ORDER
TO CATCH DIAZ, I COULDN'T
WORRY ABOUT THE COST.

586
00:29:49,747 --> 00:29:51,248
FELICITY,
YOU KNOW HOW I
FEEL ABOUT THIS.

587
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,916
I KNOW, AND THAT'S NOT
THE POINT.

588
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:54,710
THE POINT IS THAT DIAZ
DOES WORRY ABOUT THE COST.

589
00:29:54,752 --> 00:29:56,587
I MEAN, IT'S BASICALLY
HIS WHOLE M.O.

590
00:29:56,629 --> 00:29:58,130
DIAZ WANTS TO
MAKE A STATEMENT.

591
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,715
THE MAN CARRIES AROUND
A FLAMETHROWER.

592
00:29:59,757 --> 00:30:01,341
SUBTLETY ISN'T
HIS STRONG SUIT.

593
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:03,552
SO I STARTED WONDERING,
WHAT IS A STATEMENT
WORTHY OF A DRAGON?

594
00:30:03,594 --> 00:30:05,429
I RAN AN ALGORITHM
CROSS-REFERENCING

595
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:07,765
THE BETAB-500
AND THE MANUFACTURER'S
SPECIFICATION.

596
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:10,142
TURNS OUT THAT THIS MODEL
IS A NEW VERSION,

597
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:12,102
WHERE YOU CAN ATTACH
IT TO A PIPE.

598
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:15,230
FOR INSTANCE, A PIPE
UNDERGROUND FILLED
WITH GAS.

599
00:30:15,272 --> 00:30:16,649
JOHN: GAS PLANT.
FELICITY: MM-HMM.

600
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,317
JOHN: THAT BUILDING'S
TOTALLY FIREPROOF.

601
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:19,568
REST OF THE CITY,
NOT SO MUCH.

602
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:21,361
FELICITY: IF DIAZ SETS OFF
THOSE BOMBS,

603
00:30:21,403 --> 00:30:22,988
A WHOLE RIVER OF GAS
UNDERNEATH THE CITY

604
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:24,698
GOES UP IN FLAMES
LITERALLY.

605
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,450
OK. A.R.G.U.S. WILL

00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:06,427
YOU TOOK MY HUSBAND
FROM ME.

759
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:10,140
I HAD TO SEND
MY SON AWAY.

760
00:39:10,182 --> 00:39:14,144
YOU DESTROYED
MY LIFE.

761
00:39:14,186 --> 00:39:16,646
WHAT YOU GONNA DO
ABOUT IT?

762
00:39:26,323 --> 00:39:28,366
YOU DON'T HAVE
THE GUTS.

763
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:30,785
NO. I DO.

764
00:39:30,827 --> 00:39:34,122
YOU SEE, THAT'S
THE PROBLEM.

765
00:39:34,164 --> 00:39:39,336
I DO HAVE THE GUTS
BECAUSE YOU MADE ME
INTO THIS PERSON.

766
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:44,216
HMM?

767
00:39:44,257 --> 00:39:45,925
GO AHEAD.

768
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:54,017
SWEETHEART, THIS IS
THE BIG BOYS' TABLE.

769
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:55,935
YOU SHOULD LEAVE.

770
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:01,107
FELICITY, DON'T.

771
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:02,483
COULDN'T BE WITHOUT ME,
COULD YOU, BABY?

772
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:04,110
I'M ENDING HIM, LAUREL.

773
00:40:04,152 --> 00:40:06,946
NO. YOU DON'T WANT TO
DO THIS, TRUST ME.

774
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:09,199
-YES, I DO.
-NO, YOU DON'T!

775
00:40:09,241 --> 00:40:12,911
WE NEED HIM
TO HELP OLIVER.

776
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:14,495
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

777
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:22,212
I MADE A DEAL
WITH THE FEDS, A TRADE.

778
00:40:22,254 --> 00:40:25,257
DIAZ FOR YOUR HUSBAND.

779
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:26,966
IF OLIVER AGREES TO
ASSIST THEM

780
00:40:27,008 --> 00:40:30,720
WITH THEIR CASE
AGAINST DIAZ,

781
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:32,847
HE'LL BE
A FREE MAN AGAIN.

782
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:45,443
OLIVER'S COMING HOME?

783
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:47,486
YEAH.

784
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:48,863
[EXHALES]

785
00:41:00,292 --> 00:41:01,834
HOW DID YOU DO IT?

786
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:03,586
I KNEW THE GREEN ARROW
WAS GOOD,

787
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:05,088
BUT I DIDN'T THINK
HE WAS THAT GOOD.

788
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:06,965
STANLEY, I'M JUST
GLAD YOU'RE OK.

789
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:09,259
OK? I'M GREAT!
I WAS THIS CLOSE

790
00:41:09,301 --> 00:41:11,303
TO BEING STUCK IN HERE
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

791
00:41:11,344 --> 00:41:13,096
IF YOU HADN'T FOUND
TURNER'S BLADE,

792
00:41:13,138 --> 00:41:15,140
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
ALL OVER FOR ME.

793
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:20,603
HOW'D YOU KNOW IT WAS
TURNER'S BLADE?

794
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:24,065
-WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
-YOU WERE IN THE HOLE, STANLEY,

795
00:41:24,107 --> 00:41:29,487
SO HOW'D YOU KNOW
IT WAS TURNER'S BLADE?

796
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:32,407
I GUESS I MUST HAVE
HEARD IT SOMEWHERE.

797
00:41:35,327 --> 00:41:37,454
YOU GONNA EAT THAT?

798
00:42:09,402 --> 00:42:10,820
MAN: GREG, MOVE YOUR HEAD.
