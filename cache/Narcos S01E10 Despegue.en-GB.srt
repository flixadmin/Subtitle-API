1
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:22,106
When the public found out
about the excessive lifestyle

2
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:24,191
of the prisoners at La Catedral,

3
00:00:24,275 --> 00:00:28,320
the police began an investigation
into the supposed capital crimes

4
00:00:28,404 --> 00:00:31,490
being committed by Pablo Escobar
within the prison walls.

5
00:00:31,574 --> 00:00:35,745
The central part of this investigation
involves the disappearance

6
00:00:35,828 --> 00:00:37,872
of Gerardo Moncada and Fernando Galeano.

7
00:01:31,926 --> 00:01:33,552
MURDERS AT LA CATEDRAL?

8
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:37,932
Mr President,
I just spoke with the attorney general.

9
00:01:38,016 --> 00:01:42,770
Moncada’s wife reported
his disappearance from La Catedral.

10
00:01:42,854 --> 00:01:46,231
It’s clear that Escobar
killed those men in that prison.

11
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:51,946
—I don’t think he’d take it that far.
—Escobar is capable of anything.

12
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:55,033
But you know what?
This could be a good opportunity for us.

13
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,201
Forgive me, Eduardo …

14
00:01:57,284 --> 00:02:01,288
but I’m having a hard time
finding the silver lining in all this.

15
00:02:02,832 --> 00:02:06,335
This is our opportunity
to end Pablo’s vacation.

16
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:35,776
—Boss.
—Good morning, boss.

17
00:04:58,007 --> 00:04:59,217
Good morning, boss.

18
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,137
Bad news.

19
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:24,033
Have the bodies disappeared?

20
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:39,131
Our agreement with him states
he can’t be moved to another prison.

21
00:05:39,215 --> 00:05:43,761
Excuse me, but killing people in prison
is a direct violation of our agreement.

22
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:45,888
Yes, yes, but we have to tread carefully.

23
00:05:46,097 --> 00:05:49,308
If he feels we’re violating his terms,

24
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:52,144
he’ll start putting bombs
on street corners again.

25
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:59,318
Let’s tell him we’ve uncovered threats
against him from his biggest enemies.

26
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:02,613
That would give us the opportunity
to bring him to Bogotá

27
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:05,365
while we improve security at La Catedral.

28
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:11,997
The fourth brigade,
commanded by General Ariza,

29
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:14,416
would be the best choice
to carry out this operation.

30
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,585
—Ariza?
—Yes, sir.

31
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:19,588
—Is he from Medellín?
—Yes, sir.

32
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:27,221
Can we trust him?

33
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:29,140
Yes, sir.

34
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:40,419
I’m calling him.

35
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:48,260
Don Pablo, here …
Tata’s on the phone.

36
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:56,601
I was just thinking
there’s nothing in the world I’d love more

37
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:58,520
than to hear my wife’s lovely voice.

38
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:00,939
Pablo, what’s happening?

39
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:03,567
Why would something be happening here?

40
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:04,818
The soldiers.

41
00:08:05,736 --> 00:08:07,029
Soldiers?

42
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:11,116
Lots of them.
Headed to the prison right now.

43
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,743
I don’t know, Pablo.

44
00:08:14,453 --> 00:08:16,372
Tell me what’s happening.

45
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:20,167
No, my love, it’s nothing.

46
00:08:20,251 --> 00:08:21,919
Everything is cool.

47
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:27,799
I’ll call back soon, all right?

48
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:31,845
I love you, baby.

49
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:35,474
Yes, my love.

50
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:52,324
—Get out the weapons.
—As you wish, sir.

51
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,646
Listen up, company!

52
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:27,359
You will be under the command
of Lieutenant Dominguez.

53
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,779
Let’s secure the perimeter.

54
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:34,032
Tell your men
they have orders to shoot anyone

55
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:38,329
—trying to leave the prison, understood?
—As you wish, General.

56
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:39,579
Dismissed.

57
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:45,002
—Juan Pablo, where are you going?
—I’m going to the jail to help Dad.

58
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:47,629
—No, dear, you can’t go there now.
—I said I want to go!

59
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:51,425
—Juan Pablo, your father’s fine.
—He needs you to stay here

60
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:54,428
to look after your sister.
Isn’t that what he always says?

61
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:58,349
—But the soldiers are going to kill him.
—Don’t ever say that in this house!

62
00:09:58,557 --> 00:10:00,351
—They’re going to kill him!
—Quiet!

63
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:52,277
Boss?

64
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:54,071
They’re gonna try to take you out of here

65
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:57,157
and look for evidence
on Moncada and Galeano.

66
00:10:57,241 --> 00:10:59,784
If I leave this place,
someone will kill me.

67
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:05,416
Or the Americans will use their power to
restore extradition and send me to the US.

68
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:11,380
What the fuck,
let’s give those bastards lead.

69
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:14,049
—Are you fucking crazy?
—Yeah, we can take them, Don Pablo.

70
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:15,926
For every one of our men,
they have 20.

71
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:19,012
—Let’s do it now.
—Don’t be an idiot. Wait for the boss!

72
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:21,806
Stop bickering in front of the boss.

73
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,226
We have the escape routes.

74
00:11:24,435 --> 00:11:27,771
We could get into the hills
before they even know we’re gone.

75
00:11:35,404 --> 00:11:37,573
There is a time to fight …

76
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,951
and there is a time to be clever.

77
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,495
Yes, sir.

78
00:11:45,122 --> 00:11:48,875
—What’s your plan?
—Let’s talk to Gaviria.

79
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:54,632
Be smart.
Try to settle this matter peacefully.

80
00:11:57,635 --> 00:11:59,344
If that fails?

81
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:58,320
General Ariza
has orders to secure Escobar.

82
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:02,533
I want you to go there
and legalize his transfer to Bogotá.

83
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:06,077
—What do you mean, “legalize” it?
—Formalize it.

84
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:08,830
You’ll reiterate
that this is a temporary relocation

85
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:12,083
while we renovate La Catedral
to make it safer for him.

86
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:14,127
We both know that’s not true.

87
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:19,924
But it’s what you’ll tell Escobar
until he’s safely inside a military brig.

88
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:21,885
Yes, Mr President.

89
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:24,388
What’s wrong?

90
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:29,851
I’ve got a bad feeling about this.

91
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:33,438
Eduardo … I trust you,

92
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:38,235
and this is too important to leave
to someone I don’t trust completely.

93
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:44,408
I’m at your service,
Mr President.

94
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:46,326
You know that very well.

95
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:50,455
Nothing will make me happier than to see
this asshole get the justice he deserves.

96
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:43,967
Tell the boys in the comuna to stay quiet
until further notice. Understand?

97
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,595
All right. What else do you have?

98
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:50,766
—I know that.
—Velasco.

99
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:52,434
I’ll call you back.

100
00:14:53,644 --> 00:14:55,145
Yes, boss?

101
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:58,022
What’s happening outside?

102
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,026
We don’t know.

103
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,871
I fucked up.

104
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,165
What’s that, boss?

105
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,878
Gather the boys.

106
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:26,510
And tell the prison guards they’re
to fire on anyone who tries to come in.

107
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:32,599
Boss, do you think the prison guards
will follow your orders?

108
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:36,561
They’d better. I hired them.

109
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:42,275
Excuse me. Boss, the people
from Medellín just informed me

110
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:45,904
that some guy named
Eduardo Sandoval is on his way.

111
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,896
Good evening.
Where is General Ariza?

112
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,022
General!

113
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,233
Let him through.

114
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,151
Good evening, General.

115
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:30,114
—Mr Vice Minister.
—How are you?

116
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:31,909
Pleasure to see you. Good evening.

117
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:36,037
—Where’s Escobar?
—Escobar?

118
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,707
Inside the prison, obviously.

119
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,834
What do you mean,
he’s in the prison?

120
00:16:40,918 --> 00:16:43,879
I thought you were taking him into custody
when you arrived.

121
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:47,507
I’m sorry, sir,
but those were not my orders.

122
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:49,718
Then what were your orders?

123
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:53,680
My orders were to secure the perimeter,
not let anyone in or out,

124
00:16:53,764 --> 00:16:55,473
and wait for you.

125
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:58,602
That is not what the president believes.

126
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:02,105
He’s not going to be happy
to hear Escobar isn’t in your custody.

127
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:05,024
I’m sorry,
but those were my orders.

128
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:12,908
I turned myself in to that punk …
the vice minister of justice.

129
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:19,247
But since there is
no justice in this country,

130
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:21,458
he is the vice minister of nothing.

131
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:27,756
This is good.

132
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:32,135
Gaviria wants to negotiate with us.

133
00:17:36,264 --> 00:17:38,057
This is very good.

134
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:43,855
General, I don’t believe
you understand your orders clearly.

135
00:17:43,939 --> 00:17:47,818
—But I do.
—Wait a second, sir, where are you going?

136
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:50,528
I’m going to try
to make a miracle happen.

137
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:54,491
I’m going in there to convince Escobar
this is a temporary transfer of location.

138
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:58,202
And I’m also going to say
that I’m here to guarantee his safety.

139
00:17:58,286 --> 00:18:01,498
I can’t allow you
to put yourself in danger.

140
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:05,752
Do you think that Escobar is dumb enough
to kill the vice minister of justice

141
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:10,423
right in front of the fourth brigade?
For God’s sake.

142
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:14,218
At least let me make a call
so they don’t shoot you when you walk in!

143
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:17,848
Make it fast. Open the door.
You two are coming with me.

144
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,935
Didn’t you hear me?
Open the door! General!

145
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:24,521
Listen to the vice minister! Hurry up!

146
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:25,772
Open it.

147
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,545
Vice Minister, good evening.

148
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:52,298
Pablo is waiting for you. Go on.

149
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:56,094
Wait here.

150
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,771
Good evening, Vice Minister.

151
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:10,233
It’s been a while.

152
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:15,655
Good evening.

153
00:19:17,908 --> 00:19:21,036
I’m here on behalf of President Gaviria.

154
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:24,081
My orders are to escort you
to a temporary prison in Bogotá.

155
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:27,542
The government has decided to make
some improvements here at La Catedral

156
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:30,128
for your safety and everyone else’s here.

157
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:36,927
I would think Gaviria
could come up with a more believable lie.

158
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:43,892
I know why you’re here.
Because of Moncada and Galeano.

159
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:46,436
But I didn’t kill those men.
That story is a lie.

160
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:50,523
And why should the government care
about some dispute between gangsters?

161
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:52,358
We don’t care about that.
You’re mistaken.

162
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:56,071
He’s betraying me, Vice Minister.
Gaviria is betraying me.

163
00:19:56,279 --> 00:20:01,492
If your safety is a concern,
I will gladly escort you out myself.

164
00:20:01,576 --> 00:20:05,830
We have an agreement,
and you’re breaking it.

165
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:08,583
What guarantee do I have
that the Americans won’t kidnap me

166
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,209
and take me to the US?

167
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:14,297
Bush would be very happy
to stick me in a gringo jail,

168
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:17,634
like he did to Lehder,
like he did to Noriega, right?

169
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:19,594
That’s not gonna happen,
you have my word.

170
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:21,220
Your word.

171
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:26,559
As vice minister of justice?

172
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:31,773
Yes. I give you my word
as vice minister of justice.

173
00:20:31,982 --> 00:20:36,402
Haven’t you noticed that the army
has completely surrounded this jail?

174
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:41,365
We can end this peacefully,

175
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:44,953
if you just cooperate
and walk out with me.

176
00:20:45,162 --> 00:20:47,371
Don Pablo,
these bastards will kill you!

177
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:55,421
I respectfully decline your offer,
Vice Minister.

178
00:20:55,630 --> 00:21:01,719
The press is saying I killed those men,
but that’s a lie to sell newspapers.

179
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:07,976
If Gaviria wants me out of here …

180
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:14,482
he can come here …
and do it himself.

181
00:21:17,027 --> 00:21:19,112
Meanwhile …

182
00:21:19,196 --> 00:21:25,118
I’ll view any incursion
as a declaration of war.

183
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:42,343
I’ll inform the president
of your decision.

184
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:48,349
Excuse me.

185
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:02,072
Mr Vice Minister.

186
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:08,245
Why walk all that way
when I have a telephone in my office?

187
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:16,544
I’d rather call the president
from outside the prison, thanks.

188
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:22,967
Let me out!

189
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:28,723
Surely your mother taught you
never to turn down a polite invitation.

190
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:35,438
My mother taught me
an invitation is optional.

191
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:39,525
I hope you’ll forgive me
for making this invitation mandatory.

192
00:22:40,777 --> 00:22:45,364
It’s not every day we’re honoured with the
presence of a vice minister of justice.

193
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,621
Come on, Vice Minister.

194
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:54,082
Calm down, let’s go.

195
00:23:59,356 --> 00:24:02,317
What’s taking this guy so long?

196
00:24:04,194 --> 00:24:09,532
General, with all due respect, I don’t
think we should’ve let him go inside.

197
00:24:12,035 --> 00:24:13,744
No.

198
00:24:13,828 --> 00:24:17,957
I don’t think Pablo is stupid enough
to fuck with the vice minister.

199
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:36,642
Can I get you something to drink?

200
00:24:36,851 --> 00:24:39,229
I don’t need anything.

201
00:24:39,312 --> 00:24:42,023
Look, don’t be so nervous.

202
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:48,279
As soon as you have the president
on the phone, you will make it clear

203
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:53,534
that if he doesn’t remove the troops
surrounding the prison immediately,

204
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:56,454
there will be grave consequences.

205
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:01,292
But if he withdraws the troops,

206
00:25:01,376 --> 00:25:05,463
we’ll stay here quietly
and complete our sentence.

207
00:25:18,351 --> 00:25:20,395
Good evening,
President Gaviria’s office.

208
00:25:20,478 --> 00:25:24,274
It’s Eduardo, vice minister of justice.
I need to talk to the president.

209
00:25:24,357 --> 00:25:25,900
One minute, please.

210
00:25:33,074 --> 00:25:35,034
Mr President,
excuse the interruption.

211
00:25:35,118 --> 00:25:37,912
There is a call from
Vice Minister Sandoval on line three.

212
00:25:38,913 --> 00:25:41,291
—Thank you, María.
—Excuse me.

213
00:25:51,175 --> 00:25:52,176
Hello?

214
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:55,472
Hello?

215
00:26:00,435 --> 00:26:01,936
How long will I be here as a hostage?

216
00:26:02,145 --> 00:26:06,774
You are not my hostage.
You are my guest.

217
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,245
Escobar has Sandoval inside the prison.

218
00:26:19,329 --> 00:26:21,539
Hang up right now, Mr President.

219
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:24,167
—Hang up, please.
—I need to know if he’s OK.

220
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,502
Mr President, hang up the phone.

221
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:28,796
If Escobar knows you’re on the line,
he might force you to strike a bargain.

222
00:26:29,005 --> 00:26:31,508
Or worse, if you lie to him,
he might kill Eduardo.

223
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:34,177
Hang up the phone. Sir!

224
00:26:42,685 --> 00:26:43,769
Leave us alone.

225
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:52,153
—They hung up.
—Bullshit.

226
00:26:52,236 --> 00:26:53,779
Shut up!

227
00:26:58,701 --> 00:27:00,119
So, then …

228
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:05,875
the president is too busy
to speak with me.

229
00:27:07,668 --> 00:27:10,046
I don’t understand
how he ended up in that jail.

230
00:27:10,254 --> 00:27:12,131
Me, either.
I don’t know what Sandoval is doing.

231
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:15,301
What did he think, that he could convince
Escobar he was there to help him?

232
00:27:15,385 --> 00:27:18,846
We agreed that Ariza
would have Escobar in custody.

233
00:27:19,055 --> 00:27:21,640
Ariza must’ve had his reasons
for holding off.

234
00:27:22,892 --> 00:27:25,603
—Right.
—This is a very delicate situation.

235
00:27:25,686 --> 00:27:28,105
You can be sure Escobar’s men are armed.

236
00:27:28,189 --> 00:27:33,194
Please, I suggest we call DAS
to bring in a hostage negotiation team.

237
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,988
Do I have your permission?

238
00:27:39,242 --> 00:27:40,410
Good.

239
00:27:45,582 --> 00:27:48,751
María Clara,
connect me with DAS, immediately.

240
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:50,836
No. No.

241
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,338
Cancel the call.

242
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:58,177
—This time, we will not negotiate.
—I don’t understand, Mr President.

243
00:27:59,387 --> 00:28:01,222
If Sandoval dies …

244
00:28:03,099 --> 00:28:05,726
I will have it on my conscience
for the rest of my life.

245
00:28:05,935 --> 00:28:09,772
But my country comes first,
and I will not empower Escobar.

246
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:15,903
Send in the Special Forces …
and finish this, once and for all.

247
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:22,826
I just realized something.

248
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:27,706
The president didn’t just betray me …

249
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:30,418
he also betrayed you.

250
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:35,214
He knew if you came here …
Look at me.

251
00:28:35,298 --> 00:28:37,133
… there would be three options.

252
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:41,679
One: I leave with you, peacefully.

253
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:45,349
Two: I take you hostage.

254
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:49,145
Three: I shoot you,

255
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:54,358
and then he really
would have a good reason to kill me.

256
00:28:54,442 --> 00:28:55,610
Right?

257
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:07,204
Either way, he wins. Right?

258
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:10,833
Maybe the president is betraying us both.

259
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:12,876
You could be right.

260
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,878
But you know something?

261
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:18,841
I’ll sacrifice my life
to make sure you’re dead.

262
00:29:26,683 --> 00:29:30,811
You think you’re better than me,
but you’re wrong.

263
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:36,359
I come from nothing.

264
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,904
I fought hard to become what I am.

265
00:29:45,535 --> 00:29:48,329
If the government hadn’t come after me …

266
00:29:49,497 --> 00:29:54,210
I would be where you are now …
the vice minister of justice.

267
00:29:56,629 --> 00:30:00,341
You and I are nothing alike.

268
00:30:01,384 --> 00:30:03,427
You are a criminal.

269
00:30:04,387 --> 00:30:06,681
And criminals can’t run forever.

270
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:10,518
Sir.

271
00:30:24,407 --> 00:30:29,453
Your friend Gaviria has ordered
Special Forces to raid the prison

272
00:30:29,537 --> 00:30:32,081
while you’re still inside.

273
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:36,126
I would have done the same thing.

274
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:01,193
Don’t kill him.

275
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:09,326
If he dies … it will be
at the hands of his own government.

276
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:18,210
Good luck, Vice Minister.

277
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,804
Sir, I have her on the line.

278
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:50,352
—Hello, my love.
—Hello.

279
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:54,606
Look, we’re having a little problem here.

280
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:59,528
We’re trying to solve it,
but you know what to do …

281
00:38:00,529 --> 00:38:02,572
if it doesn’t work out, right?

282
00:38:02,656 --> 00:38:04,200
Yes, Pablo.

283
00:38:05,075 --> 00:38:06,743
I love you very much.

284
00:38:08,537 --> 00:38:09,872
Me, too.

285
00:38:10,873 --> 00:38:13,500
—Very much.
—Goodbye, my love.

286
00:38:38,942 --> 00:38:40,944
We are bandits.

287
00:39:07,971 --> 00:39:11,558
—Wait a minute! What is this?
—Your brigade is no longer in charge!

288
00:39:23,653 --> 00:39:26,698
You’ve gotta get me out of here,
do you understand?

289
00:39:26,782 --> 00:39:28,700
Come on, come on.

290
00:39:47,677 --> 00:39:51,014
—Hurry up!
—Get down! No! Get in there!

291
00:40:12,786 --> 00:40:14,830
Don’t move, don’t move!

292
00:40:31,388 --> 00:40:32,848
—All clear!
—All clear!

293
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:34,975
—All clear!
—All clear!

294
00:40:57,122 --> 00:40:59,582
—Stop, stop!
—It’s me, it’s me, it’s me.

295
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:04,129
Keep low, and no matter what happens,
keep moving.

296
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:16,183
Speak.

297
00:41:16,266 --> 00:41:18,268
Yes, it’s him.

298
00:41:18,352 --> 00:41:20,979
Speak up, please, I can’t hear you.

299
00:41:21,188 --> 00:41:22,731
Is that confirmed?

300
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,483
Wait a minute.

301
00:41:27,027 --> 00:41:32,032
Mr President, they stormed the prison.
Sandoval’s been freed.

302
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,495
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

303
00:41:43,335 --> 00:41:44,794
And Escobar?

304
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:54,221
Look what we found.

305
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,231
Do you think he’s OK?

306
00:42:05,441 --> 00:42:08,610
I’m sure he’s fine.

307
00:42:31,925 --> 00:42:33,593
See you tomorrow.

308
00:42:34,844 --> 00:42:36,138
Good night.
