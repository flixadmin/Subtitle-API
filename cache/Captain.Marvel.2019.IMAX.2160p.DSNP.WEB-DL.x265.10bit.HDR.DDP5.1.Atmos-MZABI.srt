1
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,920
Do you know what time it is?

2
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,560
Can't sleep.

3
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,600
There are tabs for that.

4
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,800
Yeah, but then
I'd be sleeping.

5
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,880
Dreams again?

6
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,720
Wanna fight?

7
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,280
I slipped.

8
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,520
Right, you slipped

9
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,240
as a result of me
punching you in the face.

10
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,360
I was already slipping

11
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,480
when you happened
to punch me in the face.

12
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,080
The two events
were not related.

13
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,800
Tell me about this dream.

14
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,840
-Anything new?
-No.

15
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,640
You have to let go
of the past.

16
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,960
I don't remember my past.

17
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,640
It's causing you doubt,

18
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,480
and doubt
makes you vulnerable.

19
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,720
Control it.

20
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,480
Lose control again,
and you'll have to commune

21
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,000
with the Supreme Intelligence.

22
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,000
There's nothing more dangerous
to a warrior than emotion.

23
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,120
Humor is a distraction.

24
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,280
-And anger?
-

25
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,920
Anger only serves the enemy.

26
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,640
One hundred twenty days

27
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,600
since the last Skrull attack.

28
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,080
VERS: Has anyone ever seen

29
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,800
what the Supreme Intelligence
really looks like?

30
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,600
No one can look upon
the Supreme Intelligence

31
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,000
in its true form.

32
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,320
You know that.

33
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,640
Our subconscious chooses
the way they appear to us.

34
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,080
So it's sacred. It's personal.

35
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,080
No Kree divulges it, ever.

36
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,400
VERS: Who do you see?

37
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,440
-Your brother?
-No.

38
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,800
-Father?
-No.

39
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,000
-Your old commander?
-Vers.

40
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,400
It's me you see, isn't it?

41
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,240
I see
what you're trying to do.

42
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,840
Is it working?
-Yes.

43
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,680
But you won't succeed
in changing the subject.

44
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,160
What is the point of
giving me these...

45
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,040
if you don't want me
to use them?

46
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,880
I want you to use them.

47
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,760
The Supreme Intelligence
gave me a responsibility...

48
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,720
of showing you
how to use them.

49
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,880
I know how.

50
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,000
Yeah, if that were true,
you'd be able to

51
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,120
knock me down without them.

52
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,840
Control your impulses.

53
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,280
Stop using this,
start using this.

54
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,040
I want you to be
the best version of yourself.

55
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,240
Vers.

56
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,840
Intelligence.

57
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,120
Your commander insists
that you're fit to serve.

58
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,320
I am.

59
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,840
You struggle
with your emotions...

60
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,840
with your past,
which fuels them.

61
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,600
You are just one victim
of the Skrull expansion...

62
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,840
that has threatened our
civilization for centuries.

63
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,920
Imposters
who silently infiltrate...

64
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,080
then take over our planets.

65
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,560
Horrors that you remember...

66
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,280
and so much that you do not.

67
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,600
It's all blank.
My life.

68
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,320
You're supposed
to take the form

69
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,080
of who I most admire...

70
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,600
but I don't even remember
who this person was to me.

71
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,800
Perhaps this is a mercy

72
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,200
sparing you
from a deeper pain.

73
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,680
Freeing you
to do what all Kree must...

74
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,000
put your people's needs
before your own.

75
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,560
We've given you a great gift.

76
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,240
The chance to fight
for the good of all Kree.

77
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,840
I want to serve.

78
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,960
Then master yourself.

79
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,720
What was given
can be taken away.

80
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,160
I won't let you down.

81
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,360
We'll know soon enough.

82
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,440
You have a mission.

83
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,280
Serve well, and with honor.

84
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,640
This can't be good.

85
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,640
Must be another Skrull attack.

86
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,280
Whatever it is, it's big.

87
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,520
Has a Skrull ever simmed you?

88
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,720
KORATH: Once.

89
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,080
-It was deeply disturbing.
-Why?

90
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,440
Because I stared into
the face of my mortal enemy...

91
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,480
and the face staring back
was my own.

92
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,080
Maybe if you were
more attractive,

93
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,520
then it would be
less disturbing.

94
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,640
You think you're funny,
but I'm not laughing.

95
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,960
You never laugh.

96
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,600
I laugh on the inside.

97
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,280
I'm not doing that now.

98
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,600
It's funny 'cause,
objectively speaking,

99
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,760
you're quite handsome.

100
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,000
Well, thank you.

101
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,240
Listen up, team.
Knock it off.

102
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,720
All right.

103
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,560
Prepare for...

104
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,240
a search and rescue
of our spy, Soh-Larr.

105
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,640
The Skrulls have invaded
yet another border planet.

106
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,600
This time, Torfa.

107
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,760
Soh-Larr sent us a warning.

108
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:58,280
The signal was intercepted,
and his cover's blown.

109
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,640
The Skrull general, Talos,

110
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,400
has sent kill units
to find him.

111
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,120
Should they reach him
before we do...

112
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,440
the intelligence he's acquired

113
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,240
over three years
is as good as theirs.

114
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,080
The Accusers will bomb

115
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,120
a Skrull stronghold
here in the south.

116
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,040
We slip in,
we locate Soh-Larr...

117
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,640
and we get out,
leaving them none the wiser.

118
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,360
The Torfan populace.

119
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,440
We are not to interfere
with them,

120
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,560
nor them with us.

121
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,000
Nothing compromises
the security of our mission.

122
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,840
Proceed with caution.

123
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,400
Follow protocol
before extracting him.

124
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,560
This is a dangerous mission.

125
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,560
We must all be ready
to join the Collective

126
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,080
if that is our fate today.

127
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,240
For the good of all Kree.

128
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,400
ALL: For the good of all Kree!

129
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,120
YON-ROGG:
Vers, track Soh-Larr's beacon.

130
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,920
Att-Lass, Minn-Erva,
find elevation.

131
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,280
MINN-ERVA:
Locals on the periphery.

132
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,360
Maybe a dozen.

133
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,960
-YON-ROGG: Minn-Erva?

134
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,240
Do you read me?
Does anybody copy?

135
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,160
Repeat.

136
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,800
-

137
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,760
His beacon's coming from
that temple. Let's move.

138
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,720
No. This is a perfect spot
for an ambush.

139
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,000
Only one way in,
only one way out.

140
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,680
BRON-CHAR:
We can get past the locals.

141
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,440
We don't know
if they are locals. Too risky.

142
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,680
You don't have to go with me.
I'll go alone.

143
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,880
No, you won't.

144
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,880
Right. We keep a close radius.

145
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,080
We lose comms,
we meet back at the Helion.

146
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,360
Come on.

147
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,960
Att-Lass, you getting this?

148
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,520
Copy. I see them.

149
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,720
KORATH: Get back!

150
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,440
Commander?

151
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,280
-Get back! Back!
-

152
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,680
Minn-Erva?
Do you have eyes on this?

153
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,320
Keep them back.
Minn-Erva?

154
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,720
-Does anybody copy?
-

155
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,160
I don't wanna hurt you.

156
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,960
Keep back!

157
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,480
Stay back!

158
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,040
They're locals.
I found two dead. No green.

159
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,800
They're just starving.

160
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,880
HGX-78.

161
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,800
TRT79-VVX6.

162
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,320
-Get back.

163
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,600
YON-ROGG: Skrulls!

164
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,280
Vers!

165
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,560
Vers? Skrulls.

166
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,560
It's an ambush.

167
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,560
Incoming!

168
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,200
Back to the Helion.

169
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,760
Vers. Do you copy?

170
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,320
Back to the Helion.

171
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,640
Come in. Vers.

172
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,440
How did you know the code?

173
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,520
How about
I tell you my secret...

174
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,560
when you've told me yours?

175
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,600
Let's open her up.

176
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,000
Where are we?

177
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,560
NOREX: Stand by.

178
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,560
Where's your head at?

179
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,800
In the clouds. Where's yours?

180
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,520
On my shoulders.

181
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,240
About to show these boys
how we do it.

182
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,800
You ready?

183
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,880
Higher, further, faster, baby.

184
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,960
That's right.

185
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,360
TALOS: This can't be right.

186
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,600
Go back even further.

187
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,280
You're going too fast!
You need to go slow!

188
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,320
TALOS: Who is this person?
Are we in the right...?

189
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,520
What the hell
are you thinking?

190
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,640
You don't belong out here!

191
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,120
NOREX: I think
we went back too far.

192
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,640
You let him drive.

193
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,160
NOREX: Let me try something.

194
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,760
CADET OFFICER:
Give up already!

195
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,560
You don't belong out here!

196
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,040
-You're not strong enough.

197
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,560
You'll kill yourself.

198
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,920
They'll never let you fly.

199
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,440
TALOS: Am I the only one
that's confused here?

200
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,720
You're a decent pilot.

201
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,920
But you're too emotional.

202
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,800
You do know why they call it
a cockpit, don't you?

203
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,520
A huge rumble throughout
the cosmos shook the moon...

204
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,640
and the sun and the stars
in the sky.

205
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,840
And so,

206
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,680
little Alouette flew up
throughout the night.

207
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,560
Did you see her?
It's Alouette.

208
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,080
Get your butts inside,
it's time to eat.

209
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,440
VERS: Prepare for takeoff,
Lieutenant Trouble.

210
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,720
TALOS: Charming memory.

211
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,880
NOREX: Hang on.

212
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,440
I think I've got it.

213
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,560
Goose likes you.

214
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,120
She doesn't typically
take to people.

215
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,600
Early start to your morning.

216
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,920
Uh, late night, actually.

217
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,000
I can't sleep
when there's work to do.

218
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,160
Sound familiar?

219
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,840
Flying your planes
never feels like work.

220
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,800
LAWSON:
Wonderful view, isn't it?

221
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,800
I prefer the view
from up there.

222
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,120
You'll get there
soon enough, Ace.

223
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,360
TALOS: Wait! Wait, wait!
That's her. Get her back.

224
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,160
NOREX: Stand by.

225
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,000
LAWSON: Sound familiar?

226
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,680
Wonderful view, isn't it?

227
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,560
I prefer the view
from up there.

228
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,840
You'll get there
soon enough, Ace.

229
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,040
TALOS:
What's that on her shirt?

230
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,400
I couldn't read it.

231
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,760
LAWSON:
Wonderful view, isn't it?

232
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,120
I prefer the view
from up there.

233
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,040
-TALOS: Focus.
-Excuse me?

234
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,880
TALOS: Look down.

235
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,920
Focus.

236
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,760
"Pegasus. Dr. Wendy Lawson."
That's her.

237
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,920
Do you hear that, too?

238
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,400
TALOS: Do we have
her location?

239
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,520
NOREX: Got it.

240
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,480
TALOS: Now track Lawson until
we find the energy signature.

241
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,440
Interesting.

242
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,000
Huh. Hold on.

243
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,320
Go back right before this.
Go back.

244
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,600
That's no MiG, Lawson.

245
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,120
TALOS: This is it. Now let me
see where you're headed.

246
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,760
That's right.
Look at the coordinates.

247
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,840
Focus.

248
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,040
Open, please.

249
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,680
That's it. That's it.

250
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,080
You're almost there.

251
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,800
You're almost there.
Don't fight it.

252
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,720
Focus!

253
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,080
Get her back!
Get her back now!

254
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,080
This doesn't make any sense.

255
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,640
Do we have any information
we can act on?

256
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,040
Just that Lawson was somewhere
on planet C-53.

257
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,200
We're on our way.

258
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,120
Then dig, dig, dig deeper.

259
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,400
Lawson is our link
to that light-speed engine!

260
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,040
And everything we're after.

261
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,760
Oh!

262
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,920
That did something.

263
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,400
Try that again.

264
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,040
Not yet!

265
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,960
What did you do to me?

266
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,480
Now we're just after
a little information.

267
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,120
What did you put in my head?

268
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,160
Nothing that wasn't
already there.

269
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,120
But those aren't my memories.

270
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,800
Yeah, it's like a bad trip,
isn't it?

271
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,160
I'm not surprised
you can't keep it straight.

272
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,400
They really did
a number on you.

273
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,640
Enough of your mind games.

274
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,280
-What do you want?
-

275
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,840
We're looking for the location
of a Dr. Lawson...

276
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,560
and her light-speed engine.

277
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,400
I don't know any Dr. Lawson.

278
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:47,120
Really?
Then why is she in your head?

279
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,120
You guys
wouldn't happen to know

280
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,240
how these things come off,
would ya?

281
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,840
No?

282
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,280
Fine.

283
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,120
Hmm.

284
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,080
Hey.

285
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,640
You do
know why they call it a...

286
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,960
TALOS: You leaving so soon?

287
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,400
We're just getting to know
each other.

288
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,840
Vers to Starforce command,
do you read me?

289
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,680
Hello? Do you copy?

290
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,040
Hi. I'm Vers. Kree Starforce.

291
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,400
Is this C-53?

292
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,520
Do you understand me? Is my
universal translator working?

293
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,680
Yeah. I understand you.

294
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,200
Oh, good.

295
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,160
Are you in charge of security
for this district?

296
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,720
Sort of. Uh, the movie theater
has its own guy.

297
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,080
Where can I find
communications equipment?

298
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,320
Thank you.

299
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,360
Track the pod. Find the girl.

300
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,920
She knows more than she knows.

301
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,320
Hey.

302
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,960
This one's taken.

303
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,760
Come on.

304
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,360
YON-ROGG: Vers?

305
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,600
Vers?

306
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,280
Verify. CTC-39.

307
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,600
GRXV-1600.

308
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,960
And I'm fine,
thank you for asking.

309
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,480
Is everyone okay?
What happened?

310
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,440
Skrull ambush.

311
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,160
I thought we'd lost you.

312
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,360
Did you find Soh-Larr?

313
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,720
It wasn't Soh-Larr.

314
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,800
Talos simmed him.
Even knew his code.

315
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,120
That's impossible.

316
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,120
That code was buried
in his unconscious.

317
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,560
The Skrulls
messed with my mind.

318
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,760
The machine that they used...

319
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,800
I think it's how they
extracted Soh-Larr's code.

320
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,360
Vers, where are you?

321
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,000
I'm on planet C-53.

322
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,120
The Skrulls are looking for
someone named Lawson.

323
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,640
Who?

324
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,920
She's who I see.

325
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,720
She's what?

326
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,720
Vers?

327
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,800
Vers, what?

328
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,440
She's a scientist.

329
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,440
They think that she's cracked
the code on light-speed tech.

330
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,200
I have to get to her
before they do...

331
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,800
or else they'll be able
to invade new galaxies.

332
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,720
No. You've been
caught once already.

333
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,480
How far is C-53?

334
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,640
Closest jump point
is 22 hours.

335
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,800
YON-ROGG: Vers, hold your
position until we get there.

336
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,920
Keep your comms online
so we can contact you.

337
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,960
No! What if they get
a hold of it before...

338
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,080
-AUTOMATED VOICE: We're sorry.

339
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,200
A long-distance
company access code

340
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,280
is required for the number
you have dialed.

341
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,000
-Yon-Rogg?
-Vers?

342
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,400
Vers?

343
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,880
Please dial your call
with the access code.

344
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,040
Vers?

345
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,800
KORATH: If the Skrulls got
to her, she's compromised.

346
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,960
She's stronger than you think.

347
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,760
Ever been to C-53?

348
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,520
Once.

349
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,400
It's a real shithole.

350
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,760
Hey, rookie!
Go talk to the rent-a-cop.

351
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,400
Did you call this in?

352
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,080
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Beacon activated.

353
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,880
Excuse me, miss.

354
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,440
You know anything
about a lady blowing a hole...

355
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,760
through the roof of that
Blockbuster over there?

356
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,560
Witness says
she was dressed for laser tag.

357
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,080
Oh.

358
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,400
Yeah, I think
she went that way.

359
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:22,120
Uh, I'd like to ask you
some questions.

360
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:26,280
Maybe give you the 411
on the late-night drop box.

361
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,440
Could I see
some identification, please?

362
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,360
Vers. Kree Starforce.

363
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,520
We don't carry
our identification

364
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,600
on little cards.

365
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,680
Vers?

366
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,320
Starforce?

367
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,080
How long you plan
to be in town?

368
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,320
oh, I'll be
out of your hair...

369
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,720
as soon as I track down
the Skrulls

370
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,520
that are infiltrating
your planet.

371
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,720
Skrulls?

372
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,320
Shapeshifters?

373
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,520
They can transform into any
life-form down to the DNA.

374
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,600
Oh, boy. You guys don't have
any clue, do you?

375
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on.

376
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,280
How do we know you're not
one of those shapeshifters?

377
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,240
Congratulations, Agent Fury.

378
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,320
You have finally asked
a relevant question.

379
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,440
No! Congratulations to you,
Starforce lady.

380
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,720
You're under arrest.

381
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,760
Rook!

382
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,880
Rook, let's roll!

383
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,720
Did you see her weapon?

384
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,120
-I did not.
-

385
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,080
MAN: Watch it!

386
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,120
Suspect on northbound train.
In pursuit.

387
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,920
STAN LEE: "Trust me,
true believer." "Trust me."

388
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,080
"Trust me, true believer."

389
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,240
MAN: Get off!

390
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,720
Train's heading
for a tunnel up ahead.

391
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,720
Let's greet them
at the station.

392
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,280
Mr. Fury,
this is Agent Coulson.

393
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,320
Uh, I'm still here
at the Blockbuster.

394
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,640
And, uh, where'd everybody go?

395
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,160
I finished
collecting evidence...

396
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,640
MAN: We need an ambulance!

397
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,000
MAN 2: Someone call 911!

398
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,640
MAN 3: Hey! You all right?

399
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,640
Oh, my gosh! Is everyone okay?

400
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,840
Anyone else see that?

401
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,920
Official S.H.I.E.L.D.
activity. Stay back.

402
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,280
MAN: Nice scuba suit.

403
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,640
Lighten up, honey, huh?

404
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,640
Got a smile for me?

405
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,080
Freak.

406
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,840
EXAMINER: All life on Earth
is carbon-based. Not this guy.

407
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,640
Whatever he runs on,

408
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,000
it's not
on the periodic table.

409
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,760
You're saying
he's not from around here?

410
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,840
Hey, how's your eye?

411
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,000
Well, I'd say fine...

412
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,600
but it can't believe
what it's seeing.

413
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:33,280
You say this thing
looked like Coulson?

414
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,280
Mmm. Talked like him, too.

415
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,160
And the woman said
that there were more?

416
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,240
The word she used
was "infiltration."

417
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,440
You believe her?

418
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,160
Not till I saw this.

419
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,440
What's your plan?

420
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,880
I'll find Blockbuster girl.

421
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,200
I got word
on a motorcycle thief

422
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,640
that fits her description.

423
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,520
If she can tell us
why these lizards are here...

424
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,240
maybe she can tell us
how to kick 'em to the curb.

425
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,440
Good.

426
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,200
Do it alone, though.
We can't trust anyone.

427
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,360
Not even our own men.

428
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,760
Yes, sir.

429
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,000
Wow. They're ugly bastards,
aren't they?

430
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:28,960
Yeah,
well, he's no Brad Pitt, sir.

431
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,240
Safe journey to the beyond,
my friend.

432
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,080
I will finish what we started.

433
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,680
EXAMINER: I wouldn't get
too close there, boss.

434
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,400
No one in or out.

435
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,240
Boom!

436
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,640
What can I get ya?

437
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,560
Where was
this photograph taken?

438
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,600
An airport.

439
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,000
Where's Pegasus?

440
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,760
FURY: That's classified.

441
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,480
Not unlike the file
I started on you.

442
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,680
But I see you've changed it up
a bit since then.

443
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,480
Grunge is a good look for you.

444
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,160
Did you have a rough day,
Agent Fury?

445
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,760
It was cool, you know?

446
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,720
Had a space invasion,
big car chase.

447
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,360
Got to watch an alien autopsy.

448
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,400
Typical nine-to-five.

449
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,600
So you saw one?

450
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:31,480
I was never one
to believe in aliens...

451
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,400
but I can't unsee that.

452
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:37,200
This is gonna get a little
awkward, but I gotta ask.

453
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,680
You think I'm one of those
green things.

454
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,120
Can't be too careful.

455
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:46,040
You are looking at
100% red-blooded Earth man.

456
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,520
I'm afraid
I'm gonna need proof.

457
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,640
We talking cheek swab
or urine sample?

458
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,520
No. The DNA would match.

459
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,760
Want my AOL password?

460
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,920
Skrulls can only sim
recent memories

461
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,040
-of their host bodies.
- Oh, oh.

462
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,720
You wanna get personal.

463
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,840
-Where were you born?
-Huntsville, Alabama.

464
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,400
But technically,
I don't remember that part.

465
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,000
-Name of your first pet?
-Mr. Snoofers.

466
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,440
-Mr. Snoofers?
-That's what I said.

467
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,520
Do I pass?

468
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,960
Not yet. First job?

469
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,880
Soldier.
Straight out of high school.

470
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,120
Left the ranks
a full bird colonel.

471
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,320
-Then?
-Spy.

472
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,560
-Where?
-It was the Cold War.

473
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:15,800
We were everywhere.

474
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,640
Uh, Belfast. Bucharest.
Belgrade. Budapest.

475
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,280
I like the B's.
I can make them rhyme.

476
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,600
-Now?
-Been riding a desk

477
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,680
for the past six years...

478
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,840
trying to figure out
where our

479
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:24,920
future enemies
are coming from.

480
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,160
Never occurred to me

481
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,520
they would be coming
from above.

482
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,000
Name a detail so bizarre

483
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,400
a Skrull could never
fabricate it.

484
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,480
If toast is cut diagonally,
I can't eat it.

485
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,840
You didn't need that, did you?

486
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,680
No. No, I didn't.
But I enjoyed it.

487
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,960
Okay. Your turn.

488
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,800
Prove you're not a Skrull.

489
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,920
And how is that
supposed to prove to me

490
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,200
you're not a Skrull?

491
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,640
That's a photon blast.

492
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,080
And?

493
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,160
A Skrull can't do that.

494
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,440
So, a full bird colonel

495
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,640
turned spy
turned S.H.I.E.L.D. agent...

496
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,280
must have pretty high
security clearance.

497
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,920
Where's Pegasus?

498
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:19,520
FURY: Okay.
The Skrulls sim alien races

499
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,360
to infiltrate
and take over planets.

500
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:25,560
And you're a Kree?
A race of noble warriors?

501
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:28,240
Heroes. Noble warrior heroes.

502
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,000
So, um, what do Skrulls
want with Dr. Lawson?

503
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,120
They believe
that she developed

504
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,040
a light-speed engine
at Pegasus.

505
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,760
Light-speed engine?

506
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,160
Gotta admit, that's not

507
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,560
the craziest thing
I've heard today.

508
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,280
Well, it's still early.

509
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,400
And you, what do you want?

510
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,840
To stop the Skrulls before
they become unstoppable.

511
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:49,920
And?

512
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:57,400
Look, war is
a universal language.

513
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:00,280
I know a rogue soldier
when I see one.

514
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,680
You got a personal stake
in this.

515
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,480
This is government property.

516
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,400
-Turn your vehicle around.
-

517
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,600
Nicholas Joseph Fury.
Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.

518
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,960
Place your thumb on the pad.

519
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,280
One moment.

520
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,400
Nicholas Joseph Fury.
You have three names?

521
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,560
Everybody calls me Fury.

522
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,600
Not Nicholas. Not Joseph.
Not Nick. Just Fury.

523
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,160
-What does your mom call you?
-Fury.

524
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,840
-What do you call her?
-Fury.

525
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,040
What about your kids?

526
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,960
If I have them,
they'll call me Fury.

527
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:42,360
GUARD:
You are cleared for access.

528
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,440
Thank you.

529
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:14,680
Oh, hold up.

530
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,880
You look like
somebody's disaffected niece.

531
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:20,880
Put that on.

532
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,320
-What is it?
-It's the S.H.I.E.L.D. logo.

533
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,160
Does, uh, announcing
your identity on clothing

534
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:28,720
help with
the covert part of your job?

535
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,160
Said the space soldier
who was wearing a rubber suit.

536
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,400
Lose the flannel.

537
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,840
SECURITY CHIEF:
How can I help you?

538
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,560
We're agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

539
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,920
We're looking for a woman
named Lawson.

540
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,360
A Dr. Wendy Lawson.

541
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,400
Do you know her?

542
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:03,920
Follow me.

543
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,600
VERS: Hmm.

544
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:11,560
You familiar with the phrase
"welcome wagon"?

545
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,560
No.

546
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,160
Well, this ain't it.

547
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:19,400
-

548
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:25,520
Is that a communicator?

549
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:29,000
Yeah. State-of-the-art
two-way pager.

550
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,240
Who are you paging?

551
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:34,080
My mom. Don't worry.
I didn't mention you.

552
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:13,720
After you.

553
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,520
Impressive.

554
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,400
Oh, you should see what I can
do with a paperclip.

555
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,360
FURY: Hey, there. How are you?

556
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,000
Oh, my goodness. Look at you.
Just look at you.

557
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,560
Aren't you
the cutest little thing?

558
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,960
Aren't you cute?
And what's your name, huh?

559
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,040
What's your name?

560
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:45,000
"Goose."
Cool name for a cool cat.

561
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:46,080
Fury?

562
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,400
Hmm?

563
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:50,880
I'll be back.

564
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,320
Oh! Let me get
my fingerprint out.

565
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,000
Just let me unravel
this puppy.

566
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:04,600
You sat there and watched me
play with tape?

567
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:05,760
When all you had to do was...

568
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,440
I didn't wanna steal
your thunder.

569
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,640
Huh. Lawson.

570
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:39,800
Lawson's plan
for the light-speed engine.

571
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:42,600
I wonder why
they terminated the project.

572
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:47,720
Um, maybe because
she's cuckoo.

573
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:51,480
Kree glyphs?

574
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,040
FURY: Hmm?

575
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:56,000
Lawson is not cuckoo.

576
00:46:58,320 --> 00:46:59,960
She's Kree.

577
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:02,520
Well, she's dead.

578
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,160
What?

579
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:06,000
She crashed the Asis aircraft

580
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:07,960
doing an unauthorized
test flight.

581
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,120
Took a pilot down with her.

582
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:12,440
That's why security here
is so unfriendly.

583
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,680
They're covering up
a billion-dollar mistake.

584
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:19,960
Oh, and your light-speed
engine is toast.

585
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,000
When did this crash happen?

586
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:28,840
FURY: Six years ago. 1989.

587
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,440
Who was the pilot?

588
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:35,440
Um, most of
this thing's redacted...

589
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:39,720
but there is a testimonial
here from a Maria Rambeau.

590
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,000
Last person to see them alive.

591
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:48,480
You okay?

592
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:51,440
Mm-hmm.

593
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,320
Back in a minute.

594
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,280
LAWSON: This isn't about
fighting wars.

595
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:28,200
It's about ending them.

596
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:35,760
VERS: I know Lawson was Kree.

597
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:38,840
She was here on C-53
and died in a plane crash.

598
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,680
Do you know anything
about this?

599
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:43,440
I just discovered
a mission report

600
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,120
sent from C-53.

601
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:46,320
There's only so much

602
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:49,040
I'm cleared to tell you,
Vers, but...

603
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:56,880
Lawson was an undercover
Kree operative named Mar-Vell.

604
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:00,640
She was working
on a unique energy core.

605
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,120
Experimenting with tech

606
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:05,040
that apparently could help us
win the war.

607
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:13,040
She still here?

608
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,680
She's cooperating
with the investigation, sir.

609
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,800
-You men stay here.
-AGENT: Yes, sir.

610
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:19,840
I want to question her alone.

611
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,800
Excellent work, Nicholas.

612
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,360
Does it say anything about me?

613
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,200
Anything about you?
No, of course not.

614
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:32,360
Why would it?

615
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:35,640
I found evidence
that I had a life here.

616
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:37,440
On C-53?

617
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:41,240
Mar-Vell is who I see

618
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:42,680
when I visit
the Supreme Intelligence.

619
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:46,040
I knew her.
And I knew her as Lawson.

620
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:48,440
This sounds like
Skrull simulation, Vers.

621
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,400
No, it's not. Because I
remember. I was here.

622
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:52,320
Stop. Remember your training.

623
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,760
Know your enemy.
It could be you.

624
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:58,240
Do not let your emotions
override your judgment.

625
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:01,400
FURY: She's on sublevel six.

626
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:02,960
I'll get off on five...

627
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:05,240
and take the stairs in case
she makes a run for it.

628
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:09,280
Do a pincer move
like we did in Havana.

629
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:12,480
Right. Like we did in Havana.

630
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:24,520
YON-ROGG: We're nearing
the jump point.

631
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:26,240
Leave your beacon on
so I can find you.

632
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,160
We'll get to
the bottom of this, Vers.

633
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:30,960
Together.

634
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:34,840
Okay.

635
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,000
Vers!

636
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:56,960
Vers!

637
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:15,440
Fury's colluding
with the target.

638
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:16,880
Then why would he call us in?

639
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,480
All I know is we take
him in, too. Dead or alive.

640
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:20,960
Dead or alive?

641
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:37,080
AGENT: Go. Go, go!

642
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:51,680
Was it something I said?

643
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:10,760
Mmm-mmm.

644
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:34,240
Now, you know, I don't really
need these to see...

645
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:38,880
but they do
kinda complete the look.

646
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:40,800
Don't you think?

647
00:52:58,360 --> 00:52:59,360
VERS: You called them in?

648
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:00,920
My bad.

649
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:17,000
AGENT: Coulson,
do you have eyes on them?

650
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:18,840
They're not down here.

651
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:21,280
Let's try up there.

652
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:31,800
-What?
-Your communicator.

653
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:33,720
You obviously
can't be trusted with it.

654
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:06,240
FURY: Do you know
how to fly this thing?

655
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,400
Uh, we'll see.

656
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,080
That's a yes or no question.

657
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:14,120
Yes.

658
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:19,200
That's what I'm talking about!

659
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:47,800
We got a stowaway.

660
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,000
VERS: Hang on, Goose.

661
00:54:58,200 --> 00:54:59,200
Goose.

662
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:03,440
No, Goose.

663
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:07,920
Who's a good kitty, huh?
Huh, Goose?

664
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,080
Yes, that's right.

665
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,080
Who's a good kitty, Goose?

666
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:13,720
You the good kitty,
that's right.

667
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:14,960
VERS: See anyone you know?

668
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:18,240
Funny story.

669
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:22,080
I arrived on Hala near dead.
No memory.

670
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,040
That was six years ago.

671
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:26,360
So, you think you're the pilot

672
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:27,600
that went down
with Dr. Lawson?

673
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:30,200
I'm saying the last person
to see them alive

674
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:31,280
could probably tell us.

675
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:33,040
-Maria Rambeau?
-Mm-hmm.

676
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:34,960
So, how do we get
to Louisiana?

677
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:38,400
Due east.
Hang a right at Memphis.

678
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:41,840
That agent...

679
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,920
that stopped the Skrulls
from finding us?

680
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:46,000
Coulson. The new guy.

681
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:47,440
I guess
he doesn't hate me yet.

682
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,360
Yeah, well, give him time.

683
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:52,960
I guess he had a feeling,
you know?

684
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,320
Went with his gut
against orders.

685
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:56,800
That's a really
hard thing to do.

686
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:58,880
But it's what keeps us human.

687
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:01,400
I get in trouble for that.
A lot.

688
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:02,680
Oh, I can see that about you.

689
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:08,000
Rescuing the guy who sold
you out to the Skrulls?

690
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:09,360
I'm guessing that's not

691
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,040
standard
Kree operating procedure.

692
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:13,360
Well, I won't tell your boss
if you don't tell mine.

693
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:22,640
Ronan.

694
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,680
The Accusers completed
their operation...

695
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:26,240
but the greater mission
was a failure,

696
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:27,440
thanks to your team.

697
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:29,080
It was a trap

698
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,800
to lure our operative Vers
to Torfa and kidnap her.

699
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:33,240
Give us their location.

700
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:34,760
We'll take care
of the terrorist threat.

701
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:37,240
By bombing them
out of the galaxy?

702
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:39,920
No, we'll handle this.

703
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:42,200
A cell of Skrulls anywhere

704
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:44,240
is a threat
to Kree everywhere.

705
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:45,440
Where are they?

706
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:47,240
-They are...
-Lost.

707
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,560
They are lost for now.

708
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,400
But we will find them.

709
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:56,120
Do so, or we will.

710
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:02,680
Maintain the course for C-53.

711
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:24,160
Excuse me,
I'm looking for Maria Rambeau.

712
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:27,600
Auntie Carol?

713
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:29,680
Mom, it's Auntie Carol!

714
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:33,400
I knew it!
Everyone said you were dead!

715
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:35,680
But we knew they were lying.

716
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:39,920
I'm not really
who you think I am.

717
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:51,080
That is the craziest shit
I ever heard.

718
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:54,280
Green transforming aliens?
There's no such thing.

719
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:55,960
FURY: You are
absolutely right, young lady.

720
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:57,560
There is no such thing.

721
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:59,120
'Cause if there were,

722
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,640
we would want to keep that
to ourselves.

723
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:02,880
You don't believe me?

724
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:12,120
No way!

725
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:14,440
That's so cool!

726
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,120
FURY: Oh, she can do
a lot more than make tea

727
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:17,320
with those hands.

728
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:18,560
Like what? Show us.

729
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:20,000
Maybe later.

730
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:22,480
I kept all your stuff.

731
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:23,840
I'll go get it.

732
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:26,400
You want to give her
a hand with that?

733
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:27,800
Hmm?

734
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:44,720
You don't remember anything?

735
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:49,480
I see flashes.

736
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:52,040
Little moments.

737
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:54,520
But I can't tell what's real.

738
00:58:56,840 --> 00:59:00,120
If I could just piece together
what happened that morning...

739
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:02,960
maybe it'll all make sense.

740
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:09,280
You woke me up
banging on my door at dawn.

741
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:11,000
Your usual move.

742
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:14,160
Back then,
we had to get up so early.

743
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:17,200
The Air Force still wasn't
letting women fly combat...

744
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:19,880
so testing Lawson's planes
was our only shot

745
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:21,200
at doing something
that mattered.

746
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:24,120
You wanted to race to base
in your old Mustang...

747
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:25,240
and I wasn't about to argue,

748
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:27,120
'cause I knew
my Camaro would dominate.

749
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:29,400
But you cheated,
took a shortcut.

750
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:31,120
Since when is
a shortcut cheating?

751
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:32,320
Since it violates
the predetermined

752
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:33,400
rules of engagement.

753
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:34,720
I definitely
don't remember those.

754
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:36,520
Hmm. Of course you don't.

755
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:46,720
When I got to the hangar,
Lawson was agitated.

756
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:49,920
She said
she had lives to save.

757
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,320
She was trying
to take the Asis up herself,

758
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:53,440
but you said that...

759
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:57,120
If there were lives at stake,
I would fly the plane.

760
00:59:57,320 --> 01:00:01,560
Yeah. Yep. Big hero moment.

761
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:05,160
The kind of moment
we'd both been waiting for.

762
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:09,640
The doc was always unique.
That's why we liked her.

763
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:14,480
But now you're saying
she's from another planet.

764
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:17,760
I know
this must be hard for you.

765
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:19,840
Oh, what?
This part right here?

766
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:23,000
No. No. Mmm-mmm.

767
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:29,800
Oh, what's hard
is losing my best friend...

768
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:31,640
in a mission so secret

769
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:33,800
they act
like it never even happened.

770
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:39,400
Hard is knowing
you were out there somewhere

771
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:41,360
too damn stubborn to die.

772
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:45,440
And now you come up in here
after six years...

773
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,480
with your supercharged
fire hands...

774
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:49,040
and you expect me
to call you...

775
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:51,440
I don't even know what. Vers?

776
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:55,160
Is that really
who you are now?

777
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:59,200
I don't know.

778
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:05,840
MONICA: Come look!

779
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:13,840
This is me
and you on Halloween.

780
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,280
I'm Amelia Earhart
and you're Janis Joplin.

781
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:18,960
Oh, this is you
when you were little.

782
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:20,920
You didn't get along
with your parents...

783
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:22,640
so Mom said
we became your real family.

784
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:24,360
This is us on Christmas.

785
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:25,680
I got my favorite
bunny slippers.

786
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:27,440
This is another picture of you
when you were little.

787
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:28,600
You've always wanted
to be a pilot.

788
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:29,760
And this is right after
you graduated.

789
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:31,440
This was your dog
that you got for Christmas...

790
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:33,280
This is a picture of everybody
from your Air Force team.

791
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:34,600
And this is you with Mom

792
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:35,840
right after a good day
of training.

793
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:37,320
These were
your three favorite guys.

794
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:40,920
Oh, wait. I forgot.

795
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:42,480
Your jacket.

796
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:44,040
Mom doesn't
let me wear it anymore

797
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:45,760
after I spilled ketchup on it.

798
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:01,400
MARIA: That was all
that survived the crash.

799
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:04,360
Or so we thought.

800
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:10,720
Don't answer that.

801
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:12,520
It's just my neighbor.

802
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:14,360
They can change into anyone.

803
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:20,680
Hi there.

804
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:22,080
What do you want?

805
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:25,200
-Uh...
-Hey, Tom.

806
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:26,800
This is my friend, Carol.

807
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,240
Oh. Pleased to meet you.

808
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:31,640
-Yowzers.

809
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:34,000
Static electricity
out here's no joke.

810
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:37,480
I noticed that peculiar bird
you got parked by the road...

811
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:38,640
and I was just wondering...

812
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:39,920
if you mind
if I bring the boys over

813
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,080
to get a closer look-see?

814
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:43,520
-A closer look-see?
-Yeah.

815
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:46,800
To see the "bird"
parked out by the road?

816
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:48,160
Mmm.

817
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:49,680
You're really working overtime

818
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:52,240
to sell this one,
aren't you, Talos?

819
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:55,800
I'm sorry, Tom.
This really isn't a good time.

820
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,400
I'll come by tomorrow, okay?

821
01:02:57,720 --> 01:02:59,600
-Uh...
-Okay.

822
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:05,160
You know, you really should be
kinder to your neighbors.

823
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:07,000
You never know
when you're gonna need

824
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:08,720
to borrow some sugar.

825
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:13,600
Now, hang on a second.

826
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:17,200
Before you go swinging
those jazz hands around...

827
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:20,320
making a mess
of your friend's house...

828
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:22,400
It's a lovely home, miss.

829
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:23,720
Oh, my God!

830
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:25,800
What the hell?

831
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:31,000
No one's gonna hurt the girl.

832
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:34,080
Just don't kill me.

833
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:36,040
That would really complicate
the situation.

834
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:38,880
I'm about five seconds
from complicating that wall

835
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:40,240
with some ugly-ass
Skrull brains.

836
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:41,960
TALOS: I'm sorry
I simmed your boss.

837
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:45,760
But now I stand before you
as my true self.

838
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:46,920
Without deception.

839
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:48,400
And who is that out there?

840
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:51,600
Okay, that's a fair point...

841
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:53,520
but I'm sure
that you understand

842
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:55,720
I had to take
some precautions.

843
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:59,040
I saw you crush
20 of my best men

844
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:00,160
with your hands bound.

845
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:01,480
I just wanna talk.

846
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:02,640
Last time we talked,

847
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:03,840
I ended up
hanging from my ankles.

848
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,480
That was before I knew
who you were.

849
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:09,760
Before I knew what made you
different from the others.

850
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:12,920
I have an audio recording
from Pegasus...

851
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:16,080
of your voice
from a plane crash

852
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:17,560
six years ago...

853
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:21,960
on a device I believe you call
a "black box."

854
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:25,080
They told me it was destroyed
in the crash.

855
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:26,240
How'd you get it?

856
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:27,400
She don't understand.

857
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:28,880
Young lady,
I have a special skill...

858
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:30,480
that kind of allows me

859
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:32,640
to get into places
I'm not supposed to be.

860
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:33,840
Call me "young lady" again...

861
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,280
I'm gonna put my foot
in a place

862
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:36,800
it's not supposed to be.

863
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:41,200
Am I supposed to guess
where that is?

864
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:42,960
BOTH: Your ass.

865
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:45,600
Okay, I get it. We're all
a little on edge here.

866
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:47,640
But, look,
I just need your help

867
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:48,920
decoding some coordinates.

868
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:50,920
If you'll sit down
and you'll listen to this...

869
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:54,280
I assure you,
it'll be worth your while.

870
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:59,200
Call your buddy back inside
and I'll listen.

871
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:00,800
Deal.

872
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:03,920
Oh, my God!
Get that thing away.

873
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:05,400
How'd that get in here?

874
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:06,600
Hmm?

875
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,000
-The cat?
-

876
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:10,240
This isn't what
you're afraid of, is it?

877
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:11,880
That's not a cat.

878
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:15,040
-That's a Flerken.
-FURY: A Flerken?

879
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:16,760
-MONICA: Mom?

880
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:25,240
MARIA: Monica.

881
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:26,960
-Why can't I listen, too?
-Shh!

882
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:56,200
What's happening?

883
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:57,960
It's loading.

884
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:03,080
Punch in the coordinates

885
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:07,560
5-2-2-9,
negative 4-7, 8.7-6-8, 0.2.

886
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:09,680
VERS: Copy that.
Where are we going, Doc?

887
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:11,200
LAWSON: My laboratory.

888
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:13,600
VERS: Your laboratory?
What do you mean?

889
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:14,880
LAWSON: Oh, no.

890
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:17,040
VERS: Is that...
Wait, what is that?

891
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:18,560
It's not showing up
on my radar.

892
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:20,280
LAWSON: Go, Carol. Fly!

893
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:22,840
That's no MiG, Lawson.
Who the hell are they?

894
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:25,040
Those are the bad guys.
Fly faster now!

895
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:26,120
Yes, ma'am.

896
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:34,320
-What do they want?
-Me. My work.

897
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:36,040
I never should have
brought you along.

898
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:42,240
Here come some G's.

899
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:03,520
They're firing backwards.
Hold on!

900
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:16,200
Bail out! Bail out! Bail out!

901
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:21,240
Stay with me, Lawson!

902
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:40,840
Carol, come in. Do you copy?

903
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,440
VERS: Yeah, I copy.
We hit ground.

904
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:45,160
MARIA: Carol, are you okay?
Do you copy?

905
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:47,480
Yeah! I copy.

906
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:51,240
Doc?

907
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:53,680
Your blood.

908
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:56,160
-It's blue.

909
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:59,520
Yeah, but, uh, how's my hair?

910
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,360
Help me out, will ya?

911
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:09,480
I gotta destroy it
before they get here.

912
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:10,720
VERS: Lawson?

913
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:14,880
You remember what I said about
our work here? What it's for?

914
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:17,120
To end wars?

915
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:20,920
Yeah. But the wars are bigger
than you know.

916
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:23,600
Damn it!

917
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:26,200
My name is not Lawson.

918
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:29,680
My real name is Mar-Vell,

919
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:32,560
and I come
from a planet called Hala.

920
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:35,960
I would say
that you're delusional...

921
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:37,760
but we just got shot down
by a spaceship

922
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:39,320
and your blood is blue.

923
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:44,040
Listen, I spent half my life
fighting a shameful war.

924
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:46,040
Now, skedaddle
before you give me

925
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:47,320
any more regrets.

926
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:49,600
Just remember
the coordinates, okay?

927
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:51,760
You gotta save 'em without me.

928
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:52,960
Save who? How?

929
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:56,000
Now I gotta blow this engine
before they find it.

930
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:57,480
What are you doing?

931
01:08:58,400 --> 01:08:59,640
-

932
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:19,480
We have no interest
in hurting you.

933
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:21,200
No?

934
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:24,040
'Cause all the shooting kinda
gave me the wrong impression!

935
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,040
The energy core.

936
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:29,120
Where is it?

937
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:31,000
Pararescue's on the way.

938
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:33,720
You have two minutes
until you're surrounded.

939
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:36,680
Then I see no reason
to prolong this conversation.

940
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:37,880
VERS: No, wait!

941
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:45,680
You mean that energy core?

942
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:51,360
No!

943
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:38,360
Commander? She's still moving.
Permission to fire.

944
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:39,520
Hold your fire.

945
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:51,400
MINN-ERVA:
There's nothing left.

946
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:53,240
The core has been destroyed.

947
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:04,840
YON-ROGG:
She absorbed its power.

948
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:08,880
She's coming with us.

949
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:31,120
He lied to me.

950
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:35,720
Everything that I knew
was a lie.

951
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:38,400
Now, you understand.

952
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:41,040
What?
What do I understand now?

953
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:43,080
Yon-Rogg killed Mar-Vell.

954
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:44,400
He killed her...

955
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:47,040
'cause she found out
that she was

956
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:50,360
on the wrong side
of an unjust war.

957
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:51,480
VERS: No.

958
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:54,200
Your people are terrorists.

959
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:55,840
They kill innocents.

960
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:57,760
I saw the ruins on Torfa.

961
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:01,200
Ruins that the Accusers
are responsible for.

962
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:04,880
My people lived as refugees
on Torfa.

963
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:08,640
Homeless, ever since
we resisted Kree rule...

964
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:10,800
and they destroyed our planet.

965
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:14,560
And the handful of us
that are left

966
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:16,680
will be slaughtered next...

967
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:20,840
unless you help me finish
what Mar-Vell started.

968
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:23,560
The core that she found

969
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:25,160
would have powered
a light-speed ship...

970
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:27,120
capable of carrying us
to safety.

971
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:31,280
A new home where
the Kree can't reach us.

972
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:35,120
Lawson always told us
that our work at Pegasus

973
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:36,440
wasn't to fight wars...

974
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:37,600
but to end them.

975
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:43,760
She wanted you to help us
find the core.

976
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:45,840
Well, I already destroyed it.

977
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,520
No, you destroyed the engine.

978
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:50,720
The core that powered it
is in a remote location.

979
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:55,160
If you help us
decode those coordinates...

980
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:56,880
we can find it.

981
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:00,280
You'll use it to destroy us.

982
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:05,560
We just want a home.

983
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:15,040
You and I lost everything
at the hands of the Kree.

984
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:17,040
Can't you see it now?

985
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:18,560
You're not one of them.

986
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:23,120
You don't know me.

987
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:26,960
You have no idea who I am.

988
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:31,320
I don't even know who I am!

989
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:34,920
You are Carol Danvers.

990
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:38,280
You are the woman
on that black box

991
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:40,920
risking her life
to do the right thing.

992
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:44,480
My best friend...

993
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:47,560
who supported me
as a mother and a pilot

994
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:49,080
when no one else did.

995
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:54,800
You are smart, and funny,
and a huge pain in the ass...

996
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:58,240
and you were the most
powerful person I knew...

997
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:01,480
way before you could
shoot fire from your fists.

998
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:03,640
You hear me?

999
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:06,880
Do you hear me?

1000
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:16,120
Come here. Come here, girl.

1001
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:18,200
I got you.

1002
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:25,480
TALOS: I know
I don't deserve your trust...

1003
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:27,840
but you were our only lead.

1004
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,240
We discovered
that your energy signature

1005
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:33,080
matched Mar-Vell's core.

1006
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:35,760
Now we know why.

1007
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:41,560
If only you knew
the importance of it to me.

1008
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:44,400
I just need your help

1009
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:48,040
decoding the coordinates
to Mar-Vell's lab.

1010
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:51,760
Those weren't coordinates.
They're state vectors.

1011
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:53,880
For orbital position
and velocity.

1012
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:55,760
You didn't find her lab
on Earth,

1013
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:57,080
'cause it's not on Earth.

1014
01:14:57,240 --> 01:14:58,320
VERS: That was the location

1015
01:14:58,400 --> 01:14:59,480
on the date
of the crash six years ago.

1016
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:01,040
If we track its course,

1017
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:03,440
we'll find it in orbit
right now.

1018
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:05,280
It's just basic physics.

1019
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:08,760
In orbit?

1020
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:12,240
Was that so difficult
to figure out?

1021
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:14,640
I mean,
you're my science guy, right?

1022
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:17,840
Yon-Rogg will catch up
to me soon.

1023
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,600
We've got to get to the core
before he does.

1024
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:22,480
Mmm. We're going to space?

1025
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:23,640
In what?

1026
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:25,440
NOREX: A few tweaks
to your vessel should do it.

1027
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:27,720
I can handle
the modifications.

1028
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:29,560
Mmm. Your science guy.

1029
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:38,040
VERS:
Well, I could use a copilot.

1030
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:41,800
No. No, I can't.

1031
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:43,840
I can't leave Monica.

1032
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,800
Mom, it's okay. I can stay
with Gramma and Paw-paw.

1033
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:49,440
There's no way I'm going,
baby. It's too dangerous.

1034
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:51,520
Testing brand-new aerospace
tech is dangerous...

1035
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:52,720
and you used to do that.

1036
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:56,400
Your plan
is to leave the atmosphere

1037
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:57,880
in a craft not designed
for the journey...

1038
01:15:58,040 --> 01:15:59,640
and you anticipate
hostile encounters...

1039
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:00,880
with
a technologically-superior

1040
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:01,960
foreign enemy.

1041
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:03,800
Correct?

1042
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:04,960
That's what I'm saying.

1043
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:06,320
-You have to go!
-Monica!

1044
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:07,560
You have a chance
to fly the coolest mission

1045
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:08,760
in the history of missions...

1046
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:10,680
and you're gonna give it up
to sit on the couch

1047
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:12,040
and watch Fresh Prince
with me?

1048
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:13,760
What?

1049
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:15,000
I just think
you should consider...

1050
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:18,440
what kind of example you're
setting for your daughter.

1051
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:27,360
MARIA'S MOM:
What's going on around here?

1052
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:28,560
MARIA: I know, I know.

1053
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:30,120
I'll explain inside.
Thank you.

1054
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:37,400
Your mom's lucky.

1055
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:38,840
When they were
handing out kids,

1056
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:40,600
they gave her
the toughest one.

1057
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:42,200
Lieutenant Trouble.

1058
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:44,720
You remembered.

1059
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:47,520
Is that mine?

1060
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:49,840
No, no.

1061
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:52,760
You hang on to it
until I come back.

1062
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:55,840
But there is something
that I need your help with.

1063
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:58,640
I can't wear
these Kree colors anymore.

1064
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:01,880
And since you are obviously
the only person around here

1065
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:03,800
with any sense of style...

1066
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:06,160
Hmm?

1067
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:09,320
Whoa.

1068
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:13,080
No.

1069
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:16,440
Uh-uh.

1070
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:19,480
Definitely not.

1071
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:24,800
Well, since we're
on the same team...

1072
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:37,080
Hmm.

1073
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:40,040
How do I look?

1074
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:44,880
Fresh.

1075
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:06,000
What took you so long?

1076
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:09,120
I'm fine. Thanks for asking.

1077
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:12,160
-PRY46-B...
-No, no codes.

1078
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:14,080
That system is fallible,
as we've learned.

1079
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:16,800
Okay, then let's do this.

1080
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:20,720
Who do I see when I commune
with the Supreme Intelligence?

1081
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:23,560
The person you most admire
and respect, I'd guess.

1082
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:24,960
But you would never
tell me who.

1083
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:29,600
And what is your
earliest memory of Hala?

1084
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:31,240
The transfusion.

1085
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:33,520
Blue blood
running through my veins.

1086
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:34,680
Whose blood?

1087
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:38,480
Hmm.

1088
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:49,840
That's my blood that's
coursing through her veins.

1089
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:55,840
What have you done with her?

1090
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:58,000
You're too late.

1091
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:15,640
She knows?

1092
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:33,600
Ronan, Skrulls have
infiltrated C-53.

1093
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:34,760
Come at once.

1094
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:37,040
For the good of all Kree,
Commander...

1095
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:40,040
the infestation
will be eradicated.

1096
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:44,040
Passing 500 and climbing.

1097
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:50,400
You know, you really shouldn't
have that thing on your lap.

1098
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:53,760
Our little alliance with you
is tenuous at best.

1099
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:56,640
And as long as he continues to
freak you out...

1100
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:57,960
like that...

1101
01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:00,560
yeah, I'm gonna keep
giving him

1102
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:03,480
all the loves and hugs
that he needs, right?

1103
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:05,200
Can I ask you something?

1104
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:07,480
Do you just
turn into anything you want?

1105
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:09,320
Ah, well,
I have to see it first.

1106
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:10,560
Can you all do it?

1107
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,760
Physiologically? Yeah.

1108
01:20:12,920 --> 01:20:15,120
But, uh, it takes practice...

1109
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:19,000
and, um, dare I say it,
talent to do it well.

1110
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:21,640
-Can you turn into a cat?
-What's a cat?

1111
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:22,920
What about a filing cabinet?

1112
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:26,400
Why would I
turn into a filing cabinet?

1113
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:27,680
A Venus flytrap?

1114
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:28,840
I'll give you
50 bucks right now

1115
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:30,120
if you turn into
a Venus flytrap.

1116
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:31,880
-VERS: Switching engines

Buckle up, folks.

1118
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:44,440
Hey.

1119
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:47,080
Is this normal,
like, space turbulence?

1120
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:48,160
Pretty much.

1121

VERS: Locking in
on coordinate grid.

1122

Where is it?

1123
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:31,960
It's here. It's gotta be here.

1124
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:37,400
Well, is it in front of all
that nothing, or behind it?

AUTOMATED VOICE:
Decloaking activated.

Is that it? The core?

1127
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:52,160
In her notes she called it
the Tesseract.

1128
01:22:58,320 --> 01:22:59,400
Whoa.

1129
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:03,200
What was Lawson doing
with all this kid stuff?

1130
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:18,160
We're not alone.

1131
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:42,640
SOREN: Talos!

1132
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:55,440
He didn't come here
for the Tesseract.

1133
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,240
It's okay.

1134
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:25,800
We didn't know what to do.

1135
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:29,280
Mar-Vell warned us not to send
a signal for any reason...

1136
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:30,720
or the Kree would find us.

1137
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:33,280
You did the right thing.

1138
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:44,120
TALOS: It's okay, it's okay.

1139
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:46,760
She's all right.
She's a friend.

1140
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:50,440
I am not gonna hurt you.

1141
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:52,600
She led me to you.

1142
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:54,840
I'm so sorry.

1143
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:57,800
I didn't know.

1144
01:24:57,960 --> 01:24:59,000
TALOS: Carol.

1145
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:01,800
This is war.

1146
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:06,000
My hands are
filthy from it, too.

1147
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:08,560
But we're here now.

1148
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:12,040
You found my family.

1149
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:16,240
This is just the beginning.

1150
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:19,920
There are thousands of us
separated from each other...

1151
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:23,760
scattered throughout
the galaxy.

1152
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:43,720
If I played the same pinball
machine for six years...

1153
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:45,800
I'd have
some high scores, too.

1154
01:25:48,440 --> 01:25:50,720
-Fraternizing with the enemy?

1155
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:51,960
MINN-ERVA: Uh-uh.

1156
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:06,000
What did you do
to your uniform?

1157
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:08,160
They got in her head.
Just like we thought.

1158
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:10,000
The Supreme Intelligence will
set her straight.

1159
01:26:10,160 --> 01:26:11,560
TALOS: You can see
they're not soldiers.

1160
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:14,040
Let 'em go. You can have me.

1161
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:15,400
And the core?

1162
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:17,200
You lied to me.

1163
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:21,320
I made you
the best version of yourself.

1164
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:27,680
What's given
can be taken away.

1165
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:42,520
KREE SOLIDER:
Back here! Move, move!

1166
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:45,120
-Get over here. Get down!
-

1167
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:48,320
Let's go! Go, move!

1168
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:28,760
There she is.

1169
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:32,960
Seems like your time on C-53
jogged the old memory.

1170
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:35,040
This jacket.

1171
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:37,680
It's killer, by the way.

1172
01:27:39,160 --> 01:27:40,560
Oh.

1173
01:27:40,680 --> 01:27:42,680
The music.
It's a nice touch.

1174
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:44,600
Let me out.

1175
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:46,160
No can do.

1176
01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:50,400
If you hurt them,
I will burn you to the ground.

1177
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:52,320
With what exactly?

1178
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:53,800
Your power comes from us.

1179
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,720
You didn't give me
these powers.

1180
01:27:55,920 --> 01:27:56,960
The blast did.

1181
01:27:57,120 --> 01:27:58,360
And yet, you've never had
the strength

1182
01:27:58,440 --> 01:27:59,560
to control them on your own.

1183
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:02,080
-

1184
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,640
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Species: Flerken.

1185
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:14,280
Threat: high.

1186
01:28:19,640 --> 01:28:21,520
It's a cat,
not Hannibal Lecter.

1187
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:26,640
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Species: human male.

1188
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:29,040
Threat: low to none.

1189
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:31,520
That thing's clearly busted.

1190
01:28:31,680 --> 01:28:33,800
Load the Flerken
onto the Helion.

1191
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:36,560
Eject the others into space.

1192
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:41,480
You did good, Ace.

1193
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:44,120
Thanks to you...

1194
01:28:44,280 --> 01:28:46,240
those insidious shapeshifters

1195
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:47,880
will threaten
our borders no more.

1196
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:50,280
I used to believe your lies...

1197
01:28:50,440 --> 01:28:53,080
but the Skrulls are
just fighting for a home.

1198
01:28:53,240 --> 01:28:54,800
You're talking
about destroying them

1199
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:56,480
because they won't submit
to your rule.

1200
01:28:56,680 --> 01:28:57,760
And neither will I.

1201
01:28:57,920 --> 01:29:01,080
We found you.
We embraced you as our own.

1202
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:02,720
You stole me.

1203
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:05,600
From my home,
my family, my friends.

1204
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:15,560
It's cute how hard you try.

1205
01:29:17,680 --> 01:29:19,360
But remember...

1206
01:29:20,680 --> 01:29:21,920
without us...

1207
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:23,160
STEVE: Give it up, Carol.

1208
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:26,080
Stay down!

1209
01:29:26,240 --> 01:29:27,320
SUPREME INTELLIGENCE:
...you're weak.

1210
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:29,560
STEVE: You're going too fast!
You need to go slow!

1211
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:31,080
SUPREME INTELLIGENCE:
You're flawed.

1212
01:29:31,240 --> 01:29:32,440
CADET OFFICER: Are you trying
to kill yourself?

1213
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:34,400
SUPREME INTELLIGENCE:
Helpless.

1214
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:35,600
BRET: You're too emotional
and so weak.

1215
01:29:35,960 --> 01:29:37,400
CAROL'S FATHER:
You don't belong out here!

1216
01:29:38,080 --> 01:29:39,520
SUPREME INTELLIGENCE:
We saved you.

1217
01:29:39,720 --> 01:29:41,200
YON-ROGG: Control it.
CAROL'S FATHER: I told you,

1218
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:42,280
-Carol.
-CADET OFFICER: They'll never

1219
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:43,360
-let you fly.
-CAROL'S FATHER: This ain't

1220
01:29:43,480 --> 01:29:44,560
-a game for little girls.
-BOY: You kiss like a horse.

1221
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:45,640
CADET OFFICER: You won't last
a week, Danvers.

1222
01:29:48,840 --> 01:29:51,920
Without us, you're only human.

1223
01:29:53,400 --> 01:29:54,640
You're right.

1224
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:58,000
I'm only human.

1225
01:30:31,960 --> 01:30:35,320
On Hala, you were reborn...

1226
01:30:35,480 --> 01:30:36,840
Vers.

1227
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:44,760
My name is Carol.

1228
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:01,120
She's trying to break out.

1229
01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:48,760
I've been fighting with one
arm tied behind my back.

1230
01:31:49,720 --> 01:31:51,280
But what happens when...

1231
01:31:54,440 --> 01:31:56,480
I'm finally set free?

1232
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:39,520
You know you're glowing,
right?

1233
01:32:39,680 --> 01:32:40,680
VERS: I'll explain it later.

1234
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:44,560
Take the Tesseract.

1235
01:32:44,720 --> 01:32:45,840
Leave the lunchbox.

1236
01:32:46,040 --> 01:32:47,520
-Me?
-Yes.

1237
01:32:47,680 --> 01:32:49,040
I'm not touching that thing.

1238
01:32:49,200 --> 01:32:50,280
You want me to
get you an oven mitt?

1239
01:32:56,120 --> 01:32:57,320
Whoa!

1240
01:33:03,960 --> 01:33:06,480
Get the Skrulls
on the Quadjet and go.

1241
01:33:06,640 --> 01:33:08,760
Take the Flerken with you.

1242
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:11,160
-What about you?
-I'll buy you some time!

1243
01:33:13,080 --> 01:33:14,920
I'm picking you up now.

1244
01:33:18,040 --> 01:33:20,560
I'm trusting you
not to eat me.

1245
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:26,760
Oh, hey, guys.

1246
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:32,320
Arm wrestle for the Tesseract?

1247
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:37,320
I used to find you amusing.

1248
01:33:38,040 --> 01:33:39,040
Let's put an end to this.

1249
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:46,800
-

1250
01:34:14,480 --> 01:34:15,440
Okay.

1251
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:17,120
Good kitty.

1252
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:28,360
-

1253
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:05,360
You knew all along.

1254
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:07,640
Is that why we never hung out?

1255
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:08,920
No, I just never liked you.

1256
01:35:12,920 --> 01:35:14,000
-

1257
01:35:16,160 --> 01:35:17,160
Incoming!

1258
01:35:25,680 --> 01:35:26,680
GUARD: Hey, in a hurry?

1259
01:35:28,920 --> 01:35:30,680
Don't make me do this.

1260
01:35:30,920 --> 01:35:31,920
Okay.

1261
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:48,800
Come on, do your thing!

1262
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:51,080
Come on!

1263
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:54,840
Come on!

1264
01:35:57,960 --> 01:35:59,360
-Damn it, Goose.
-

1265
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:00,560
Pick a side.

1266
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:03,320
-

1267
01:36:04,760 --> 01:36:06,640
Take them to the hangar, too.

1268
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:08,600
We'll blast them all
into space.

1269
01:36:10,680 --> 01:36:11,680
Play it cool.

1270
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:14,520
Just like Havana.

1271
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:18,440
Do you have the thing?

1272
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:20,160
Flerken kitty ate it.

1273
01:36:33,560 --> 01:36:34,920
GUARD: Come on, move!

1274
01:36:35,080 --> 01:36:36,240
Move!

1275
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:38,120
Follow my lead.

1276
01:36:42,120 --> 01:36:43,120
Cover her eyes.

1277
01:36:51,640 --> 01:36:53,160
-Onto the ship!

1278
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:55,080
Let's go! Let's go!

1279
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:11,880
-

1280
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:19,920
Nice diversion.

1281
01:37:20,280 --> 01:37:22,040
I could have swore
I put it in there.

1282
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:46,280
-

1283
01:38:19,080 --> 01:38:21,160
Minn-Erva, take them down
in the drop ship.

1284
01:38:21,320 --> 01:38:22,400
On it.

1285
01:38:27,080 --> 01:38:28,200
You all right, friend?

1286
01:38:29,280 --> 01:38:31,200
Never better.

1287
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,800
We got a bogey coming in hot.

1288
01:40:17,680 --> 01:40:19,320
Yes! Boom!

1289
01:40:35,320 --> 01:40:36,520
Whoo!

1290
01:40:39,880 --> 01:40:41,200
What the hell was that?

1291
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:06,720
Deploy ballistic warheads.

1292
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:00,400
RONAN: That's impossible.

1293
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:02,960
C-53 doesn't have
a defense system

1294
01:42:03,040 --> 01:42:05,680
advanced enough
to destroy our warheads.

1295
01:42:07,120 --> 01:42:09,640
ACCUSER: That's not
their defense system, Ronan.

1296
01:42:14,080 --> 01:42:15,280
Take her down.

1297
01:42:35,200 --> 01:42:36,240
Whoo!

1298
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:27,760
Return to the jump point.

1299
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:30,920
We'll be back for the weapon.

1300
01:43:32,480 --> 01:43:33,680
The core?

1301
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:36,800
The woman.

1302
01:44:24,920 --> 01:44:26,400
I'm so proud of you.

1303
01:44:28,400 --> 01:44:29,760
You've come a long way

1304
01:44:29,840 --> 01:44:31,800
since I found you
that day by the lake.

1305
01:44:32,360 --> 01:44:34,480
But can you keep
your emotions in check

1306
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:36,760
long enough to take me on?

1307
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:39,600
Or will they get the better
of you as always?

1308
01:44:41,160 --> 01:44:42,840
I always told you...

1309
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:44,280
you'll be ready

1310
01:44:44,360 --> 01:44:46,720
the day you can knock me down
as yourself.

1311
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:48,320
This is that moment.

1312
01:44:48,480 --> 01:44:51,000
This is that moment, Vers!

1313
01:44:51,160 --> 01:44:52,240
Turn off the light show...

1314
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:55,760
and prove to me
you can beat me without...

1315
01:45:11,280 --> 01:45:13,280
I have nothing
to prove to you.

1316
01:45:29,120 --> 01:45:31,160
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Destination: Hala.

1317
01:45:31,320 --> 01:45:32,960
I can't go back empty-handed.

1318
01:45:33,120 --> 01:45:34,880
You won't be empty-handed.

1319
01:45:35,040 --> 01:45:37,320
I'm sending you
with a message.

1320
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:40,680
Tell the Supreme Intelligence
that I'm coming to end it.

1321
01:45:40,840 --> 01:45:43,600
The war. The lies.
All of it.

1322
01:45:45,480 --> 01:45:46,840
You can't do this.

1323
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:09,320
That was a close call,
huh, Goosey? Huh?

1324
01:46:09,400 --> 01:46:10,400
-

1325
01:46:10,480 --> 01:46:11,880
Those bad guys
still in there somewhere?

1326
01:46:11,960 --> 01:46:13,040
-Ow!

1327
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:14,360
Mother Flerken!

1328
01:46:14,560 --> 01:46:15,640
-You okay?
-FURY: Yeah.

1329
01:46:16,080 --> 01:46:17,640
It's just a scratch.

1330
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:19,280
No.

1331
01:46:26,840 --> 01:46:28,680
-VERS: I can't believe

1332
01:46:28,760 --> 01:46:30,160
you got in the raddest
dogfight ever...

1333
01:46:30,280 --> 01:46:31,640
and I missed it.

1334
01:46:31,800 --> 01:46:33,400
MARIA: I'd say you arrived
just in time.

1335
01:46:33,560 --> 01:46:35,600
FURY: Some nifty flying
you did out there.

1336
01:46:35,760 --> 01:46:37,760
S.H.I.E.L.D. could always use
a good pilot like you.

1337
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:39,640
I'll consider it...

1338
01:46:39,800 --> 01:46:42,800
as long as you never
call my flying "nifty" again.

1339
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:44,160
How's your eye?

1340
01:46:44,240 --> 01:46:46,360
Hmm. Getting better
every second.

1341
01:46:46,520 --> 01:46:47,760
Just so I'm clear...

1342
01:46:47,920 --> 01:46:49,280
you were Soh-Larr...

1343
01:46:49,440 --> 01:46:51,480
-and the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent?
-FURY: Keller.

1344
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,320
He tied my boss up,
stole his identity.

1345
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:57,320
I borrowed his likeness.
I'm no thief.

1346
01:46:57,520 --> 01:46:58,760
It is a little like stealing.

1347
01:46:58,920 --> 01:47:00,200
Whose side are you on here?

1348
01:47:00,600 --> 01:47:02,040
FURY: You're good to go here
until you recover...

1349
01:47:02,200 --> 01:47:05,240
but you and your family
are gonna need a new look.

1350
01:47:05,440 --> 01:47:07,000
I could go back
to being your boss.

1351
01:47:07,160 --> 01:47:08,160
Uh, please don't.

1352
01:47:08,360 --> 01:47:11,200
Come on. I loved sporting
his beautiful blue eyes.

1353
01:47:11,360 --> 01:47:13,680
No way.
You guys have the best eyes.

1354
01:47:13,880 --> 01:47:15,840
Don't ever change your eyes.

1355
01:47:15,920 --> 01:47:17,400
TALOS: She has beautiful eyes.
That's very sweet of you.

1356
01:47:17,480 --> 01:47:19,160
MONICA: I was trying
not to panic...

1357
01:47:19,320 --> 01:47:20,760
I'll help you find a home.

1358
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:23,000
Finish what Mar-Vell started.

1359
01:47:25,080 --> 01:47:27,240
MONICA: They can stay here
with us.

1360
01:47:27,440 --> 01:47:29,000
Can't they, Mom?

1361
01:47:29,160 --> 01:47:31,080
They won't be safe here, baby.

1362
01:47:31,680 --> 01:47:33,240
Auntie Carol's right.

1363
01:47:33,400 --> 01:47:34,400
They need their own home.

1364
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:37,400
I'll be back
before you know it.

1365
01:47:37,880 --> 01:47:41,160
Or maybe I could fly up
and meet you halfway?

1366
01:47:41,320 --> 01:47:44,120
Ah, only if you learn to glow
like your Auntie Carol.

1367
01:47:44,280 --> 01:47:45,680
Or maybe I'll build
a spaceship.

1368
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:47,520
-You don't know.
-He doesn't.

1369
01:47:57,280 --> 01:47:59,680
Keep the Tesseract on Earth.

1370
01:48:00,400 --> 01:48:01,400
Hidden.

1371
01:48:01,560 --> 01:48:03,600
You sure that's what
Marvel would want?

1372
01:48:04,280 --> 01:48:05,360
Mar-Vell.

1373
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:06,800
That's what I said.

1374
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,320
It's two words. Mar. Vell.

1375
01:48:09,480 --> 01:48:10,840
Mar-Vell.

1376
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:12,080
"Marvel" sounds a lot better.

1377
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:13,440
You know,
like the Marvelettes.

1378
01:48:27,360 --> 01:48:28,440
Not ringing any bells?

1379
01:48:28,600 --> 01:48:30,400
Keep singing.
Maybe it'll come back to me.

1380
01:48:45,720 --> 01:48:47,240
I upgraded it.

1381
01:48:47,840 --> 01:48:50,320
Range should be
a couple galaxies, at least.

1382
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:55,160
What? You think
I'm gonna crank call you?

1383
01:48:55,320 --> 01:48:58,880
For emergencies only, okay?

1384
01:49:03,520 --> 01:49:05,640
Well...

1385
01:49:06,320 --> 01:49:08,600
if you're ever passing
back through this galaxy...

1386
01:49:08,760 --> 01:49:10,800
be sure to give
a brother a shout.

1387
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:14,840
-Oh!

1388
01:49:27,560 --> 01:49:29,600
MONICA: We got
the ketchup stain off.

1389
01:49:35,040 --> 01:49:36,840
VERS: Thanks,
Lieutenant Trouble.

1390
01:49:46,120 --> 01:49:48,720
It's hard for me
to say goodbye, too.

1391
01:50:02,400 --> 01:50:03,560
Go on.

1392
01:51:10,640 --> 01:51:13,360
Glad to have you back, sir.
This came for you.

1393
01:51:18,320 --> 01:51:19,520
So, is it true?

1394
01:51:20,600 --> 01:51:21,800
That the Kree
burned your eye out...

1395
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,400
because you refused
to give them the Tesseract?

1396
01:51:25,360 --> 01:51:29,040
I will neither confirm nor
deny the facts of that story.

1397
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:30,360
Understood.

1398
01:51:31,920 --> 01:51:32,880
I'm sorry to report

1399
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:34,000
that we still haven't
found the Tesseract.

1400
01:51:34,160 --> 01:51:36,360
I'm sure it'll turn up
somewhere.

1401
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:39,680
I'll let you know
when it does.

1402
01:51:39,880 --> 01:51:41,240
Then what?

1403
01:51:41,800 --> 01:51:42,800
Sir?

1404
01:51:43,160 --> 01:51:44,280
We have no idea

1405
01:51:44,360 --> 01:51:47,400
what other intergalactic
threats are out there.

1406
01:51:47,600 --> 01:51:49,600
And our one-woman
security force

1407
01:51:49,680 --> 01:51:50,920
had a prior commitment...

1408
01:51:51,080 --> 01:51:52,840
on the other side
of the universe.

1409
01:51:55,680 --> 01:51:57,720
S.H.I.E.L.D. alone
can't protect us.

1410
01:51:59,480 --> 01:52:01,000
We need to find more.

1411
01:52:01,320 --> 01:52:02,320
More weapons?

1412
01:52:02,480 --> 01:52:04,080
More heroes.

1413
01:52:04,360 --> 01:52:05,880
You think you can find
others like her?

1414
01:52:05,960 --> 01:52:08,960
Hmm, we found her,
and we weren't even looking.

1415
01:52:10,080 --> 01:52:11,360
Get some rest, sir.

1416
01:52:12,440 --> 01:52:14,280
You got
a big decision to make.

1417
01:55:13,400 --> 01:55:15,080
This is a nightmare.

1418
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:19,000
I've had better nightmares.

1419
01:55:21,160 --> 01:55:22,200
RHODES: Hey.

1420
01:55:23,280 --> 01:55:25,400
So, that thing just stopped

1421
01:55:25,480 --> 01:55:27,160
doing whatever the hell
it was doing.

1422
01:55:29,080 --> 01:55:30,880
What do we got?

1423
01:55:31,800 --> 01:55:34,080
Whatever signal it was sending
finally crapped out.

1424
01:55:34,320 --> 01:55:35,360
STEVE: I thought
we bypassed the battery.

1425
01:55:35,440 --> 01:55:36,440
RHODES: We did.

1426
01:55:36,600 --> 01:55:39,440
It's still plugged in.
It just stopped.

1427
01:55:40,360 --> 01:55:42,120
Reboot it.
Send the signal again.

1428
01:55:42,280 --> 01:55:43,680
We don't even know
what this is.

1429
01:55:43,840 --> 01:55:46,240
Fury did. Just do it, please.

1430
01:55:46,520 --> 01:55:49,040
You tell me
the second you get a signal.

1431
01:55:49,200 --> 01:55:51,680
I wanna know who's on
the other end of that thing.

1432
01:55:54,640 --> 01:55:56,040
Where's Fury?
