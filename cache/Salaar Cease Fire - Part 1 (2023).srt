1
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,250
In a far-off place,

2
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:41,666
amidst vengeance and enmity...

3
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,958
flourished an inseparable friendship.

4
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,875
Who is it?
Who?

5
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:50,750
Hey, Deva!
Forget it.

6
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:53,166
-Listen to me.
-Tell Me.

7
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:54,791
Who is it?

8
00:00:58,166 --> 00:00:59,083
Deva!

9
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:06,541
-Why did you touch him?
-Deva, don't!

10
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:08,208
Oh...

11
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:11,000
I thought you were bringing a huge army.

12
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,166
But you got only him?

13
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:18,583
Just because you are born to my father

14
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:20,500
you won't get the right
to wear that nose ring.

15
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:22,000
You have to earn it.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,416
Just tell me how.

17
00:01:36,958 --> 00:01:38,625
Do you see that wrestler?

18
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:40,500
He is my champion.

19
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:43,250
He has not yet known what defeat is.

20
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:44,708
Any challenger here?

21
00:01:45,875 --> 00:01:47,291
There is no man here?

22
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,666
Make him fall to the ground.

23
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:49,916
I will give back your nose ring.

24
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:52,666
How is that even possible?
How can he make him fall to the ground?

25
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,625
Answer me, anybody here?

26
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:57,125
Absolutely no pressure.

27
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:59,333
The nose ring will remain
with me.

28
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:01,416
If you don't have the courage, back off...

29
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:03,541
...step-brother.

30
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,125
Rudra, you are making a mistake.

31
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:08,875
You know me very well.

32
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:11,416
But, you don't know about him.

33
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:16,000
He will hit him so hard
that he would fly.

34
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:20,708
Before he finishes him off,
give back my nose ring.

35
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:25,000
If there is anyone, come forward.

36
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:27,208
He?

37
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:29,125
What will he do?

38
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:31,416
Tell me!

39
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:33,416
Come on!

40
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:36,000
Is there no man here?

41
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,250
What is he even capable of?

42
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,625
At least, there is one man here.

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,083
Get lost!

44
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,708
Hey, Deva!

45
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:01,125
I told you to get lost!

46
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:11,500
Deva!

47
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:17,916
He is going to die.

48
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:27,250
Deva!

49
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:53,875
Deva!

50
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:55,416
Don't!

51
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,416
Deva?

52
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:15,416
Deva, open your eyes!

53
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:17,458
Deva, open your eyes!
Deva!

54
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:19,208
Deva!

55
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,541
Deva, open your eyes!

56
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:25,708
Did he fall to the ground?

57
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:57,125
Give it back!

58
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:02,458
Give it to me.

59
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,833
If you touch his nose ring again

60
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:17,666
It won't be an electric wire
in my hands.

61
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:21,375
It will be an electric pole.

62
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,708
Let's go!

63
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,791
In a far-off place

64
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,291
those who lose the battle

65
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,541
used to lose everything.

66
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:19,708
I want her.

67
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:21,041
I will go first.

68
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,500
-I will show you. I...
-I want her.

69
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:56,708
Hey!

70
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,083
If you try to touch his mother...

71
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:00,708
I will kill you all.

72
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:02,250
Go away from here!

73
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:11,000
Sir, don't stand in our way.

74
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,166
This is your father's order.

75
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:15,333
Nobody can
disobey him.

76
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:17,333
It should be done.

77
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,791
If you leave now, I will give you

78
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,666
my territory in return.

79
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,583
Varadha, think again.

80
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,125
I will give you Bharghat.

81
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:05,166
Bharghat is mine!

82
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,333
Bharghat is mine!
Bharghat...

83
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:10,000
Out of all our territories

84
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:11,958
this is the biggest.

85
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,333
That is exactly why
I gave it to him, Baba.

86
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:16,791
Bharghat is mine!

87
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:21,125
No one outside of here
should know about this.

88
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:22,958
Get lost now!

89
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:26,541
Hey, let's go.

90
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:36,250
Bharghat belongs to me!

91
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:43,291
Deva.

92
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:47,916
I am here for you.

93
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,250
Don't worry.

94
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:53,541
You shouldn't stay here anymore.

95
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,500
You must leave immediately.

96
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:59,000
In that far-off place

97
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:01,500
even those close friends

98
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,166
had to part ways.

99
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:06,416
Hey, make it quick.

100
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:10,458
Promise me

101
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,750
that you will never
come back to this place.

102
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:20,375
You should forget whatever happened here.

103
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:24,375
Promise me.

104
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:34,000
Deva!

105
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:43,791
I am ready to be the hunted

106
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,125
or the hunter for you.

107
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:51,291
Only for you.

108
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,250
Whenever you call me

109
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:57,333
I will come back to this place.

110
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,333
I don't know if you remember.

111
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,583
The story I told you when
you were a kid.

112
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:15,666
A sultan of the Persian empire

113
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:21,375
wouldn't deploy his formidable
army no matter how big the problem is.

114
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,833
Instead, he would go to only one man.

115
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:28,250
He, who fulfills whatever
the Sultan wished for

116
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:31,791
and destroys the Sultan's opponents.

117
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:37,250
That man was called...

118
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,375
I know, Baba.

119
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:48,041
Salaar!

120
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:20,458
He will come back.

121
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:23,500
My Salaar!

122
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:26,583
The sun sewed a wing

123
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:29,250
And winked his eyes with love

124
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:35,333
Has the beautiful twilight cloud come?

125
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:41,333
Have the rain cloud
poured down jasmine flowers?

126
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:44,166
You are the one
who was born in the sky

127
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:47,416
My lucky star, be my precious gold

128
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:53,291
on this earth.

129
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:59,083
Be a song, my beloved,
who touched my heart

130
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:20,041
One will hold the bow

131
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:23,041
And the other will be the arrow.

132
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:26,375
One is a roar and the other
is the turbulent sea.

133
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,208
Together they make deluge.

134
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:32,250
One is bravery
and the other a trident.

135
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:35,250
The new day will be a day of battle.

136
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:40,750
Now it will be a love that
where blessing merges with letters.

137
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:44,833
May it flourish a hundred years.

138
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:52,958
Please come with me.
I'll show you the stock.

139
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:53,875
Okay.

140
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:57,125
-Hello!
-Bilal!

141
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:58,666
My daughter is on her way to India.

142
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,708
Have you gone crazy?

143
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:03,333
-Why did you let her?
-Do you think I did?

144
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:05,125
She came there on her own.

145
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:07,291
If they come to know
anything about her...

146
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:08,375
No need for any doubt.

147
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:09,916
They have been searching
for the past seven years.

148
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:11,416
They would've known by now.

149
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:12,916
Radha Rama...

150
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:16,208
She is not a harmless soul

151
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:17,708
sitting quietly in a corner.

152
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:20,791
You have no idea
how powerful she is today.

153
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:25,250
After all, even Radha Rama's maid,
Obulamma

154
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,958
can decide the fate
of elections in certain constituencies.

155
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:30,333
Mother!

156
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,791
Speak.

157
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:33,000
We have finally found.

158
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:34,583
Not him.
We found his daughter.

159
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:35,875
Hey!

160
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:45,541
Krishnakanth had created eight fake
passports for himself and his daughter.

161
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:48,416
And one of these passports has been used
to book a ticket from the US to India.

162
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,750
Tomorrow at 6 o'clock in the morning...

163
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:52,875
she will land at Lal Bahadur Shastry
International Airport, Babatpur.

164
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:57,958
Apart from this, she has
two notorious henchmen.

165
00:14:58,125 --> 00:14:59,083
Vedha...

166
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:00,708
Krishnakanth's daughter
is coming to India, sir.

167
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:03,750
Krishnakanth's daughter?

168
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,958
Hazare.

169
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:08,208
Tell me, Obulamma.

170
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:11,500
Krishnakanth's daughter
has come here.

171
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:14,416
I want her at any cost!

172
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:17,291
-Jessy!
-Sir?

173
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,250
I have a lot
of election works here.

174
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:21,166
Leave for Babatpur immediately.

175
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,208
Okay, sir.

176
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,750
For what you did to them seven years ago,

177
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,750
they will pay back
using your daughter.

178
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:29,416
Please do something, Bilal.

179
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,583
But what can I do?

180
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,208
Only you know his whereabouts.

181
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:38,625
So?

182
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,166
You remember the promise, Bilal?

183
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,375
Brother, show us the goods.

184
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:50,666
Get out! All of you, out!

185
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:52,916
Get out! All of you, out!

186
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:22,708
The time has come to fulfill your promise.

187
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:24,750
I know you won't come,
no matter what I say.

188
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:26,458
I am sending someone to you.

189
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:29,500
Whatever you decide, do it.

190
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,416
Three cars have been arranged...

191
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,166
...at the airport parking.

192
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:00,041
In the street next to the airport...

193
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:02,458
There are two cars and a tempo traveler.

194
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:09,166
Come on!

195
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:40,916
What is going on?

196
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:46,708
- Hey...
- Hey...

197
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:47,708
-Come.
-Who are you?

198
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:56,083
Hey! No, no... No!

199
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:58,166
Come on, quick!

200
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:01,333
Go, go!

201
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:19,583
Hey, go! Chase them!

202
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,208
Hey, hey!

203
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:04,000
What the hell is happening?

204
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:05,583
Why are they attacking me?

205
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:08,500
There must be some sort of a mistake.
D-Did you see them, they...

206
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:11,333
They just shot that guy in the middle
of the road in broad daylight...

207
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:12,458
Speak.

208
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,500
Listen to me carefully, Aadhya.

209
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:18,958
-Dad! Dad...
-The guy who is with you.

210
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:20,041
Do as he says.

211
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:22,125
I will get you out of there
very soon.

212
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,166
Don't call me under any circumstances.

213
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,250
No... Dad...

214
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:26,666
Listen to me, Dad.

215
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,083
No, no... no...

216
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:29,666
We... we need to call the cops!

217
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:31,541
We need to call the cops, please.

218
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:32,750
- You don't have to...
- Hey!

219
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:35,750
You shouldn't have come to India.
But you did!

220
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,708
You have no idea
what is happening here.

221
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:39,375
No need to understand also

222
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:40,750
and we don't have time for that.

223
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,083
In this situation

224
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:44,166
there's only one person in
all of India

225
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:47,166
who can protect you.

226
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:48,666
Mother!

227
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:12,541
She doesn't easily trust
or accept any outsider.

228
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:14,916
You will have to convince her.

229
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:16,666
For whatever reason,

230
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,916
she should never get to know who you are.

231
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:20,416
Good evening, Teacher.

232
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,000
This is Diya from Vijayawada.
She knows our language.

233
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:25,416
A distant relative of our bank manager,
Mr Ajay Kumar.

234
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:27,333
She wants to teach English
to the kids in our school.

235
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:29,041
That post is vacant anyway.

236
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:31,125
Let's employ her.
She will stay in your guest house.

237
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,375
Uh... only if you agree.

238
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:35,458
What is your qualification?

239
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:36,666
Uh... English Literature.

240
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:39,000
Her AADHAAR Card...

241
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:39,916
Voter ID...

242
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,375
Class X, intermediate
and degree certificates...

243
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:44,791
I have verified them all, Teacher.
You can check them too.

244
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,541
Where did you work before this?

245
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:47,875
Siddhartha Convent.

246
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:51,750
Who is going to teach the kids? You?

247
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:52,791
Or she?

248
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:57,875
Where did you work before?

249
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:59,333
Siddhartha Convent.

250
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:00,333
Why did you quit?

251
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:01,250
Actually...

252
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:04,000
You are highly educated. Why
do you want to work in a place like this?

253
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:05,000
That's what I...

254
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:06,875
Mr Sarpanch,
I don't think she is up to the task.

255
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:08,666
Send her away and
find someone else.

256
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:20,625
When we reach a new place,
we like it

257
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:22,083
not because of that place.

258
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:23,875
It's because of the people there.

259
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:28,000
I have roamed several places
and finally come here.

260
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:31,000
Like how you are apprehensive
of trusting an outsider...

261
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,958
I am very apprehensive as well.

262
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,250
Let us both take a chance.

263
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:39,166
If it doesn't work out...

264
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:41,750
I will leave.

265
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,083
You can stay in the out house.

266
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:52,375
Not I, the children here
must like your teaching.

267
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:54,083
You have three days.

268
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:57,500
If the children don't like you,
you must leave on the fourth day.

269
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:00,000
Hey, get up!

270
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:04,666
If you don't bring your parents tomorrow,
or don't turn up at school,

271
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:06,500
you will know who I am.

272
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:07,958
Leave!

273
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:11,041
Why did you lie?

274
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:12,708
Who lied?

275
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:13,666
Hey, get going.

276
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:20,791
Children are like molten iron.

277
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:25,000
If we mold them well,

278
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,708
they become lamps that spread light.

279
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:37,625
If we don't,

280
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:45,833
they become blood-shedding...

281
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,750
...weapons.

282
00:23:31,125 --> 00:23:32,708
Get freshened up and come.

283
00:23:35,041 --> 00:23:36,208
I will get you some food.

284
00:23:51,666 --> 00:23:52,916
I did as you instructed.

285
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,875
She has agreed.
Please let me go.

286
00:23:56,333 --> 00:23:57,541
Hey, Sarpanch!

287
00:24:07,291 --> 00:24:09,875
-Jessy?
-Sir, that girl is missing.

288
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:20,333
She hasn't been eating
since yesterday, Madam.

289
00:24:22,208 --> 00:24:23,416
He should be killed.

290
00:24:23,875 --> 00:24:24,750
He should be killed.

291
00:24:25,791 --> 00:24:27,583
For the past seven years

292
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:31,333
you have been sitting
like this in darkness,

293
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,250
on the bare floor,

294
00:24:33,583 --> 00:24:37,416
in the burning smoke.

295
00:24:42,208 --> 00:24:48,375
I know for a fact that no hunger matches
the hunger for vengeance.

296
00:24:49,208 --> 00:24:51,916
Krishnakanth couldn't be traced.

297
00:24:52,333 --> 00:24:55,875
Even though his daughter came here,

298
00:24:56,208 --> 00:24:59,166
our men failed to catch her.

299
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:04,833
But no matter where she is, I'll find her
and make her kneel in front of you.

300
00:25:07,083 --> 00:25:09,375
Even to exact your revenge,

301
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:12,750
you need to stay alive.

302
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,791
Our time has come.

303
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:50,458
Our time has come.

304
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:10,375
More than finding her, their plan

305
00:26:10,458 --> 00:26:12,750
would be to make sure
she doesn't leave India.

306
00:26:12,916 --> 00:26:14,583
File a case against the girl.

307
00:26:14,666 --> 00:26:15,541
- It won't happen again.
- Case?

308
00:26:15,625 --> 00:26:17,125
-Charge her with murder.
-Murder?

309
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:19,208
-Whose murder should I mention?
-Please, sir!

310
00:26:26,625 --> 00:26:27,666
Do your job.

311
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:32,916
They will file a case against her and
inform the Embassy and police stations.

312
00:26:33,083 --> 00:26:34,500
You got to take a look at this.

313
00:26:34,833 --> 00:26:36,958
Aadhya Krishnakanth, 28 years old...

314
00:26:37,083 --> 00:26:40,375
US National, murdered Jessy Bhagga.
Varanasi outskirts.

315
00:26:40,458 --> 00:26:41,541
-Hey...
-Brother?

316
00:26:42,041 --> 00:26:44,583
Send our men in all directions.

317
00:26:44,666 --> 00:26:47,791
Bus stations, railway stations, ports,
airports, highways, borders...

318
00:26:48,041 --> 00:26:49,625
Their men will be everywhere.

319
00:26:49,791 --> 00:26:53,083
-There should not be any mistake.
-Okay, boss.

320
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,000
They can come here any time.

321
00:26:55,083 --> 00:26:56,375
They are searching for this car.

322
00:26:56,458 --> 00:26:57,583
Dismantle it immediately.

323
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:03,000
Could you find where the vehicle
with that girl went?

324
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:07,541
Found it on a CCTV footage, sir.

325
00:27:09,541 --> 00:27:12,833
They left that van at a warehouse
and went out in a black SUV.

326
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,500
Obulamma has already
instructed Hazare to find that girl.

327
00:27:18,166 --> 00:27:19,458
Why are we also searching for her?

328
00:27:19,791 --> 00:27:21,375
We are not looking for the girl.

329
00:27:21,916 --> 00:27:23,791
We are looking for Krishnakanth.

330
00:27:24,916 --> 00:27:27,625
For the past seven years,
we have been searching for him.

331
00:27:30,375 --> 00:27:32,541
We searched every nook
and corner of the country.

332
00:27:33,458 --> 00:27:36,666
We have access to every single
CCTV camera in the country.

333
00:27:37,833 --> 00:27:39,958
But not a single CCTV could capture him.

334
00:27:40,583 --> 00:27:42,375
We don't know where he is.

335
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,166
Then what is the relation
between the girl and him?

336
00:27:45,625 --> 00:27:46,750
There is a relation!

337
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:49,416
Wherever she is...

338
00:27:49,791 --> 00:27:51,250
he is bound to be there.

339
00:27:52,916 --> 00:27:54,750
Find that vehicle first.

340
00:28:09,916 --> 00:28:11,041
Hello!

341
00:28:11,208 --> 00:28:13,041
Can anybody hear me?

342
00:28:13,166 --> 00:28:16,125
-Good morning, Teacher.
-Good morning, Teacher.

343
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,833
Ma'am.

344
00:28:19,541 --> 00:28:22,416
Though we locked her in,
the English teacher came out.

345
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,916
Someone locked the door from outside.

346
00:28:25,083 --> 00:28:26,083
-That's why I am late...
-Chandru.

347
00:28:26,166 --> 00:28:27,000
Yes, Ma'am.

348
00:28:27,083 --> 00:28:30,375
Take this teacher to her classroom
and explain the syllabus to her.

349
00:28:30,541 --> 00:28:32,375
-Let's go.
-Good morning, Teacher.

350
00:28:32,791 --> 00:28:35,500
Hitler has left.

351
00:28:39,875 --> 00:28:40,875
Take the syllabus.

352
00:28:40,958 --> 00:28:43,250
Take children. Take class.

353
00:28:43,666 --> 00:28:44,541
And take care.

354
00:28:44,625 --> 00:28:46,333
Okay, you all just look here.

355
00:28:54,916 --> 00:28:56,375
Come on.

356
00:28:58,041 --> 00:28:59,125
Hey, come here.

357
00:29:13,833 --> 00:29:16,291
When the children have no interest,
why are you forcing them?

358
00:29:16,375 --> 00:29:19,125
I won't send him to school from tomorrow.
Do whatever you want.

359
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,708
I will burn you all to ashes.

360
00:29:23,625 --> 00:29:27,000
What you did is a mistake. Do you
want them to become like you?

361
00:29:27,708 --> 00:29:30,125
Hey! All of you are
attending school from tomorrow.

362
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,458
Understand?

363
00:29:34,583 --> 00:29:36,500
She sounds crazy, doesn't she?

364
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,333
Even I used to think
about her the same way.

365
00:29:38,791 --> 00:29:41,000
Most of those who live here
work in that coal mine.

366
00:29:41,083 --> 00:29:44,208
Even small children work there
for daily wages.

367
00:29:44,291 --> 00:29:45,875
Four years ago, Teacher
came to this place.

368
00:29:45,958 --> 00:29:49,666
She literally begged everyone
and got this school reopened.

369
00:29:49,833 --> 00:29:52,666
Since then, she has been educating
the children in this school.

370
00:29:55,791 --> 00:29:57,916
Now let's meet another person.

371
00:30:05,583 --> 00:30:08,666
Though Teacher is like this,
her son is entirely different.

372
00:30:11,666 --> 00:30:13,750
Hey, you! Are you blind?
Can't you see?

373
00:30:13,958 --> 00:30:15,583
But it was your mistake.

374
00:30:15,833 --> 00:30:17,083
No problem, Uncle.

375
00:30:17,166 --> 00:30:18,083
Sorry, brother.

376
00:30:18,166 --> 00:30:19,333
I will move back.

377
00:30:19,583 --> 00:30:21,541
Though he looks tall and imposing,

378
00:30:21,625 --> 00:30:24,833
he doesn't even retaliate
when someone behaves rudely with him.

379
00:30:24,916 --> 00:30:27,083
He doesn't mingle with anyone
or talk to anyone.

380
00:30:27,166 --> 00:30:29,250
Neither does he get angry
despite eating so much chilli.

381
00:30:30,708 --> 00:30:32,416
But when he is with kids...

382
00:30:32,541 --> 00:30:33,833
he becomes one of them.

383
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:36,083
What is this suspense?

384
00:30:36,166 --> 00:30:38,000
Should we wait for you so long
every single day?

385
00:30:38,083 --> 00:30:41,958
Hey, like a batsman sent to bowl,
they gave me all sorts of assembling work.

386
00:30:42,041 --> 00:30:43,791
Had they asked me
to disassemble something...

387
00:30:44,125 --> 00:30:46,041
I would've done it in a single strike.

388
00:30:46,208 --> 00:30:47,875
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

389
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,166
Sixer!

390
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:54,583
Salute!

391
00:30:57,958 --> 00:31:00,958
He hit a sixer against your bowling
and you are saluting him?

392
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:06,833
You are always playing with us.
Don't you have friends of your own?

393
00:31:06,916 --> 00:31:08,250
Hey, pass me the ball.

394
00:31:54,208 --> 00:31:55,916
How many times should I tell you?

395
00:32:00,125 --> 00:32:01,750
You should be home by 6 in the evening.

396
00:32:01,875 --> 00:32:03,416
I told you once and isn't that enough?

397
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,583
Do I need to tell you this every day?

398
00:32:07,958 --> 00:32:09,708
If you repeat this...

399
00:32:11,125 --> 00:32:13,125
I won't be late from tomorrow, Mom.

400
00:33:05,833 --> 00:33:06,958
Excuse me.

401
00:33:09,541 --> 00:33:12,416
Bilal said I can leave today.

402
00:33:14,041 --> 00:33:15,125
Just one more day.

403
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:34,583
Should eliminate!

404
00:33:34,666 --> 00:33:41,458
Should eliminate!

405
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:44,500
Should eliminate!

406
00:33:52,666 --> 00:33:53,958
Stop! Enough!

407
00:33:54,208 --> 00:33:55,750
Stop... Just stop it!

408
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:57,416
Nobody can teach any of you.

409
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,625
Why?
Why are you doing this to me?

410
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,458
Very bad.
It's impossible to teach you.

411
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:03,666
So bad!

412
00:34:05,041 --> 00:34:07,916
-Good morning, Teacher.
-Good morning, Teacher.

413
00:34:09,125 --> 00:34:10,000
Please, sit down.

414
00:34:10,791 --> 00:34:12,375
Your teacher seems tired.

415
00:34:12,541 --> 00:34:14,041
She cannot teach today.

416
00:34:14,125 --> 00:34:16,333
She will go to the market
and buy lights.

417
00:34:23,041 --> 00:34:24,333
One run.

418
00:34:24,416 --> 00:34:25,750
Where is the ball?

419
00:34:25,833 --> 00:34:26,958
Look there.

420
00:34:43,125 --> 00:34:44,000
Hey!

421
00:34:44,208 --> 00:34:46,500
When did you start
playing cricket without me?

422
00:34:47,041 --> 00:34:48,083
Why don't you come to play?

423
00:34:48,166 --> 00:34:49,208
I will come tomorrow. Go.

424
00:34:49,333 --> 00:34:51,083
Hey, let's go. Got the ball!

425
00:34:55,791 --> 00:34:57,708
You asked me to tell you if she goes out.

426
00:34:57,791 --> 00:35:00,333
Hitler has sent the English teacher
to the market.

427
00:35:02,916 --> 00:35:04,208
Hello, hello! Madam!

428
00:35:05,166 --> 00:35:07,000
You brought everything for double
the price and where are you going?

429
00:35:07,666 --> 00:35:09,375
You are my property.

430
00:35:09,875 --> 00:35:11,166
I am your owner.

431
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:14,541
Hey, you got a nice property, man.

432
00:35:18,125 --> 00:35:19,625
Hey, leave her alone.

433
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,125
Hey! The hero is here.

434
00:35:23,958 --> 00:35:28,333
He is going to beat us all
and take her away.

435
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:30,666
Come on.

436
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:33,750
Hit me, come on, hit me.

437
00:35:33,875 --> 00:35:35,458
Hit me!

438
00:35:36,083 --> 00:35:38,125
Hey, hit me!

439
00:35:38,708 --> 00:35:40,416
My face is broken.

440
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:46,333
He thinks that he is a great hero.

441
00:36:06,875 --> 00:36:09,625
Hey, it's the cops!
Let's go.

442
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:35,333
The vehicle was last seen
near Navada toll in Bihar.

443
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,000
We don't know where
it went from there.

444
00:36:38,791 --> 00:36:40,750
Where could it have gone?

445
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,958
Send her photo to all our men.

446
00:36:44,208 --> 00:36:45,416
I will send it immediately, sir.

447
00:36:46,666 --> 00:36:49,208
What is taking Hazare so long?

448
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:53,000
Is he not capable of nabbing
even a girl?

449
00:36:53,166 --> 00:36:54,375
Madam, it's Nayak!

450
00:36:56,166 --> 00:36:57,041
What is it, Nayak?

451
00:36:57,125 --> 00:36:57,958
Obulamma...

452
00:36:58,041 --> 00:37:00,125
The consignment you were asking
about has arrived at Kandla Port.

453
00:37:00,208 --> 00:37:01,625
Tell me when the delivery should be made.

454
00:37:02,041 --> 00:37:05,333
Didn't I ask you to deliver it to Nepal?

455
00:37:05,791 --> 00:37:08,041
Don't call me again.

456
00:37:08,458 --> 00:37:09,458
Whatever comes up,

457
00:37:09,791 --> 00:37:11,416
Vedha will take care of it.

458
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:19,125
That's it?

459
00:37:19,208 --> 00:37:21,791
Only these many?
They didn't even bring weapons with them.

460
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:23,916
That one man is enough.

461
00:37:26,666 --> 00:37:27,708
Hey, Nayak!

462
00:37:28,083 --> 00:37:28,916
How are you?

463
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,541
It's a hundred million dollar consignment.

464
00:37:30,625 --> 00:37:31,500
A small one.

465
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:34,291
But if you deliver this properly,
you will get many more big deals.

466
00:37:34,666 --> 00:37:36,750
You are the right guy for this job.

467
00:37:38,833 --> 00:37:40,416
Nepal!

468
00:37:41,708 --> 00:37:42,541
Fine.

469
00:37:43,125 --> 00:37:45,041
Then I will go and roam around Nepal.

470
00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:49,833
He doesn't even look interested.

471
00:37:50,083 --> 00:37:50,916
Hey.

472
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:53,458
Don't disturb me until we reach Nepal.

473
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:54,833
Don't worry.

474
00:37:55,041 --> 00:37:56,916
No one will stop the consignment
once he stamps that seal on it.

475
00:38:01,375 --> 00:38:03,458
Will he even be able
to get out of the port?

476
00:38:19,083 --> 00:38:22,375
This is how you flush
a hundred million dollars down the toilet!

477
00:38:27,041 --> 00:38:28,375
Sir!

478
00:38:28,541 --> 00:38:30,083
The cops have surrounded us!

479
00:38:31,166 --> 00:38:32,000
Open it!

480
00:38:42,875 --> 00:38:44,000
Hey, close the door!

481
00:38:44,083 --> 00:38:45,250
Close the door!

482
00:38:47,166 --> 00:38:48,833
Hey, open the gate.

483
00:38:49,041 --> 00:38:49,958
Open it!

484
00:38:53,708 --> 00:38:54,833
What is it?

485
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:56,000
Nothing, sir.

486
00:38:59,458 --> 00:39:02,166
We got information about this
cocaine consignment one month ago.

487
00:39:03,125 --> 00:39:04,333
Why did we let them go, sir?

488
00:39:07,458 --> 00:39:09,041
Did you see the seal?

489
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:12,875
Do you know where it came from?

490
00:39:15,333 --> 00:39:20,000
Before you could think of even saying
the name of the place, they will kill you.

491
00:39:22,708 --> 00:39:23,791
The seal?

492
00:39:24,291 --> 00:39:25,291
Who stopped it?

493
00:39:25,625 --> 00:39:29,083
Call all the control rooms and tell them
that nobody should stop the seal.

494
00:39:29,416 --> 00:39:30,541
What are you saying, sir?

495
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,833
The seal?

496
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,083
I shall inform right away.

497
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:37,750
Inform everywhere immediately.

498
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:38,666
Yes, sir.

499
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:42,375
I have heard about that place as a child.

500
00:39:43,166 --> 00:39:45,708
That some tribes rule the place.

501
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:50,333
That they have built huge
walls barring outsiders

502
00:39:50,458 --> 00:39:53,708
and they have a strong army
and the most advanced weapons.

503
00:39:55,958 --> 00:39:58,541
But isn't that an urban legend?

504
00:40:01,083 --> 00:40:04,291
I don't know if that place exists or not

505
00:40:09,291 --> 00:40:15,916
but it true that I got scared
when I heard about it.

506
00:40:20,166 --> 00:40:21,250
I told you.

507
00:40:21,958 --> 00:40:23,375
There is nobody in India

508
00:40:24,041 --> 00:40:25,458
who can stop that seal.

509
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:35,583
Cutout...

510
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:36,500
Cutout...

511
00:40:36,583 --> 00:40:38,000
Hey, I am painting. Be careful.

512
00:40:38,083 --> 00:40:40,583
Hey! Stop that.
It's my birthday today. Go!

513
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:45,125
Don't you know that you must
wish me exactly at midnight?

514
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:47,583
Sorry, Pari. I forgot about it.
Happy birthday.

515
00:40:47,708 --> 00:40:49,000
Okay, fine. Come.
Let's cut the cake.

516
00:40:49,083 --> 00:40:50,500
Come on!

517
00:40:50,583 --> 00:40:52,416
-Let's cut the cake.
-It's your birthday. You should cut it.

518
00:40:52,541 --> 00:40:54,500
No, you should cut the cake.

519
00:40:54,583 --> 00:40:55,708
-Hey, come on.
-No. It's your birthday...

520
00:40:55,791 --> 00:40:57,583
Hey, come on.
I am getting angry.

521
00:40:57,666 --> 00:40:59,416
-Come on, come.
-Hey!

522
00:41:04,791 --> 00:41:06,583
Hey! Move out, quick!

523
00:41:12,125 --> 00:41:13,083
Hey!

524
00:41:35,083 --> 00:41:36,250
That thing...

525
00:41:37,791 --> 00:41:39,250
Give it to me.

526
00:42:16,083 --> 00:42:17,541
Just a small knife!

527
00:42:19,416 --> 00:42:20,833
That too a plastic knife.

528
00:42:30,125 --> 00:42:31,125
Vijay...

529
00:42:31,416 --> 00:42:32,416
Yes, Teacher?

530
00:42:32,916 --> 00:42:34,750
You remember the song I taught you?

531
00:42:35,041 --> 00:42:36,208
Yes, Teacher.

532
00:42:37,125 --> 00:42:38,125
Sing it.

533
00:42:39,791 --> 00:42:44,916
In every story it's the demon
Who unleashes violence

534
00:42:45,583 --> 00:42:50,833
And to oppress that demon
Rises a king...

535
00:42:51,208 --> 00:42:56,458
In his quest to quell the enemy
The king has embraced savagery

536
00:42:56,791 --> 00:43:02,125
He has made violence
A habit and forgotten how to smile

537
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:07,458
He slayed the monster,
Fighting resolutely

538
00:43:07,625 --> 00:43:13,041
Filled with ire, he has turned into
A monster himself

539
00:43:13,125 --> 00:43:18,625
If one has your courage
he will definitely succeed

540
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:24,666
Remember, oh skilled warrior,
Forgive and live on this land

541
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:30,166
Enough of anger
Now sing a song of love

542
00:43:30,291 --> 00:43:35,291
Stop a war with a smile
And no more war and pain

543
00:43:35,708 --> 00:43:41,500
Climb up that rock
with the truth

544
00:43:41,666 --> 00:43:46,833
Your name is etched
all over that rock

545
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:52,375
Whatever written over it

546
00:43:52,916 --> 00:43:57,916
Was erased in heavy rain

547
00:44:30,458 --> 00:44:31,958
Chandru, Chandru!

548
00:44:32,375 --> 00:44:33,416
Where did he go?

549
00:44:33,583 --> 00:44:35,625
He has to take
lunchbox to the coal mine.

550
00:44:35,708 --> 00:44:36,958
I shall take it.

551
00:44:38,958 --> 00:44:41,000
Let me be useful at least for this.

552
00:44:55,791 --> 00:44:56,791
This girl?

553
00:44:58,416 --> 00:45:00,000
Sir, this girl is right here.

554
00:45:00,375 --> 00:45:01,833
She is here in Tinsukia.

555
00:45:02,125 --> 00:45:04,000
-What happened?
-We found the girl.

556
00:45:04,166 --> 00:45:06,375
She is in Tinsukia, Assam.

557
00:45:06,541 --> 00:45:07,375
Tinsukia?

558
00:45:07,458 --> 00:45:08,666
It is near the borders of Burma.

559
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,583
There is a coal mine on the outskirts.

560
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:13,291
Majority of the people working
there have migrated from our place.

561
00:45:14,666 --> 00:45:16,375
Are there any CCTVs there?

562
00:45:17,583 --> 00:45:18,708
It's a very remote place, sir.

563
00:45:18,833 --> 00:45:20,375
They don't even have
banks or post offices.

564
00:45:21,583 --> 00:45:22,541
Then...

565
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:24,916
They must be there.

566
00:45:25,958 --> 00:45:28,416
-Sir?
-Leave for Tinsukia immediately.

567
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:29,333
Come on, guys.

568
00:45:30,333 --> 00:45:32,166
Who are you sending there?

569
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:33,125
I'm sending Selfie.

570
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:39,375
Sir.

571
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:41,666
Keep sending photographs from Tinsukia.

572
00:45:41,958 --> 00:45:42,958
Okay, sir.

573
00:45:43,208 --> 00:45:44,041
Let's go.

574
00:45:47,416 --> 00:45:50,333
Oh, no! This girl is good for nothing.

575
00:46:05,583 --> 00:46:06,791
Actually, I was...

576
00:46:07,666 --> 00:46:08,708
I know.

577
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:11,166
There is only one more day, right?

578
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:17,916
-Hey, baby...
-Hey!

579
00:46:19,375 --> 00:46:20,375
Smile!

580
00:46:21,541 --> 00:46:23,250
Wow! Amazing!

581
00:46:28,041 --> 00:46:29,125
Come. Let's go.

582
00:46:29,458 --> 00:46:30,458
Hey!

583
00:46:37,208 --> 00:46:38,666
Help!

584
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:47,500
Is he her savior?

585
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:50,291
She must have mistaken him
for someone else.

586
00:46:50,666 --> 00:46:52,166
He is not capable of doing that.

587
00:47:07,625 --> 00:47:10,375
My goodness! I don't know from
where the Sarpanch got this girl.

588
00:47:10,458 --> 00:47:11,791
She is absolutely good for nothing.

589
00:47:11,875 --> 00:47:13,541
She took one box and forgot the other.

590
00:47:13,625 --> 00:47:15,791
She never does anything right.
Where is she?

591
00:47:21,916 --> 00:47:22,916
Hey, hey!

592
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,375
Where are you dragging her?
Let her go!

593
00:47:25,458 --> 00:47:26,583
I'm talking to you.

594
00:47:29,041 --> 00:47:30,333
Why are you guys not helping?

595
00:47:30,416 --> 00:47:31,458
Go, save the girl.

596
00:47:35,708 --> 00:47:37,083
There are so many men here!

597
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:38,875
Can't any of you save her?

598
00:47:40,375 --> 00:47:43,125
Oh, no! Look, can no one save her?

599
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:45,875
Oh, no! Anyone?

600
00:47:46,166 --> 00:47:48,208
Please, someone help her!

601
00:47:48,333 --> 00:47:51,000
No one will stop them and no one can.

602
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,583
There is only one person
who can stop them.

603
00:47:56,958 --> 00:47:58,125
And that's you.

604
00:48:02,458 --> 00:48:03,916
Oh, no! So many...

605
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,541
There are so many men out here.

606
00:48:05,625 --> 00:48:07,000
Is no one capable?

607
00:48:07,083 --> 00:48:08,250
Your son is here as well, right?

608
00:48:08,333 --> 00:48:09,875
Why don't you ask him? Isn't he a man?

609
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:15,500
Oh, damn!

610
00:48:16,708 --> 00:48:18,208
We have left him behind.

611
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:21,000
Cut his head off and bring it to me.

612
00:48:29,958 --> 00:48:33,250
The ash formed on the burning coal
needs to be blown away

613
00:48:34,791 --> 00:48:36,833
so that the heat inside can be felt.

614
00:48:44,166 --> 00:48:46,291
Hey, they are going to kill our cutout.

615
00:49:11,958 --> 00:49:13,541
What can the poor guy do?

616
00:49:13,625 --> 00:49:16,041
He is like an old rusty
vehicle that would never start.

617
00:49:26,625 --> 00:49:30,250
It was me who bound you
not to raise your hands on anyone.

618
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,791
Now, I set you free
from any bounds whatsoever.

619
00:49:44,541 --> 00:49:45,666
Deva!

620
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,166
Stop them!

621
00:49:54,583 --> 00:49:56,500
You can even plead with them.

622
00:50:03,666 --> 00:50:05,958
Or make them bleed.

623
00:51:41,541 --> 00:51:43,583
Just one strike!

624
00:53:28,416 --> 00:53:29,791
Now your face is broken.

625
00:55:00,583 --> 00:55:02,666
Go upstairs and pack everything.
You need to go today itself.

626
00:55:13,625 --> 00:55:15,250
I am responsible for all of this.

627
00:55:15,416 --> 00:55:18,500
I had convinced Deva
that she would be safe here.

628
00:55:18,583 --> 00:55:20,708
I don't care about that.

629
00:55:21,541 --> 00:55:25,416
Right now, all that matters to me
are my son and I, nothing else.

630
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,916
Neither do I have the leisure
to think about anyone else's problems.

631
00:55:29,875 --> 00:55:32,541
Village after village, town after town,
city after city.

632
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,125
We were moving from one place to another.

633
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:38,875
I thought we would find peace here.

634
00:55:40,041 --> 00:55:41,750
But now we have to get going again!

635
00:55:42,541 --> 00:55:44,083
Where should I go from here?

636
00:55:44,666 --> 00:55:47,083
Tell me, speak up.

637
00:55:48,666 --> 00:55:51,083
Because of you, my son had to... again...

638
00:55:58,375 --> 00:56:00,416
Take that girl and go away, Bilal.

639
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:13,791
This is my mother.

640
00:56:17,625 --> 00:56:19,416
I came to India for this.

641
00:56:20,208 --> 00:56:24,000
My mom always wanted to come to India.

642
00:56:24,166 --> 00:56:26,000
But my dad would never allow her.

643
00:56:27,416 --> 00:56:29,458
At least I have to fulfill
my mother's wish

644
00:56:30,333 --> 00:56:32,625
of scattering her ashes here.

645
00:56:34,666 --> 00:56:36,541
I know I have asked
you a lot, but...

646
00:56:38,916 --> 00:56:41,625
Can you do this
one last thing for me? Please...

647
00:56:49,541 --> 00:56:52,000
The children didn't like you, nor did I.

648
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:56,875
Take her away, Bilal.

649
00:57:14,291 --> 00:57:15,416
Obulamma.

650
00:57:16,041 --> 00:57:17,125
That girl...

651
00:57:20,125 --> 00:57:23,625
They are not capable of it.

652
00:57:31,875 --> 00:57:32,708
Hello.

653
00:57:32,791 --> 00:57:34,125
There is a change
in the delivery point.

654
00:57:35,583 --> 00:57:38,791
There is a check post near Budherabad,
under the control of the local Maoists.

655
00:57:38,958 --> 00:57:40,791
They are our men.

656
00:57:40,875 --> 00:57:43,625
Cross the check post and you
will reach the borders of Burma.

657
00:57:43,875 --> 00:57:45,333
Deliver it there.

658
00:57:45,791 --> 00:57:48,750
Along with that consignment,
you need to bring a girl as well.

659
00:57:49,250 --> 00:57:50,208
Where is that girl now?

660
00:57:50,458 --> 00:57:53,708
On the way to that check post, you
will find a small town named Tinsukia.

661
00:57:55,416 --> 00:57:57,333
You should bring that girl from there.

662
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,083
It seems like we are lucky today.

663
00:58:04,916 --> 00:58:06,083
Turn the vehicle.

664
00:58:12,083 --> 00:58:13,916
The delivery point has been changed.

665
00:58:15,625 --> 00:58:16,875
Let's go there.

666
00:58:16,958 --> 00:58:17,875
Hey!

667
00:58:17,958 --> 00:58:19,875
Let's go to the Burma border.
Come on, let's go.

668
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:24,041
Once you cross the border...

669
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:25,666
It's okay, Deva. I will take care.

670
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:32,583
Deva.

671
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:34,291
Let's get going.

672
00:58:47,083 --> 00:58:51,416
Should eliminate!

673
00:58:51,833 --> 00:58:53,500
Krishnakanth!

674
00:58:53,916 --> 00:58:55,750
It's been so long since I saw you.

675
00:58:56,333 --> 00:58:57,416
How are you?

676
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:58,916
It's me that you want, right?

677
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
I am here.

678
00:59:00,083 --> 00:59:02,916
Kill me if you want
but please spare my daughter.

679
00:59:42,250 --> 00:59:43,750
-Seal...
-Okay, sir!

680
00:59:44,208 --> 00:59:45,208
Hey!

681
00:59:45,333 --> 00:59:48,458
Stamp the seal on the girl
and then put her in the truck.

682
00:59:57,041 --> 00:59:59,500
The girl must be already in the truck.

683
00:59:59,791 --> 01:00:01,500
and been stamped with the seal.

684
01:00:02,083 --> 01:00:04,500
They would be bringing her here.

685
01:00:12,666 --> 01:00:14,666
You will be killed anyway.

686
01:00:14,750 --> 01:00:19,583
You must watch your daughter
die with your own eyes.

687
01:00:25,291 --> 01:00:27,875
She is not capable for this.
Find someone else.

688
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:29,250
Give me!

689
01:00:33,375 --> 01:00:35,958
The children didn't like you, nor did I.

690
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,416
Once we reach Burma, we
won't be able to escape.

691
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:08,791
Answer some of my questions first.

692
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:11,583
Who are the people who want to kill me?

693
01:01:12,833 --> 01:01:14,208
What did my dad do to them?

694
01:01:15,666 --> 01:01:17,875
Why did they bring me to you?

695
01:01:18,583 --> 01:01:21,750
Why did his mother react
so much, over a plastic knife?

696
01:01:22,750 --> 01:01:25,333
Why doesn't he cross
the boundaries set by her?

697
01:01:26,083 --> 01:01:27,458
And what is this?

698
01:02:01,916 --> 01:02:03,458
Hold somewhere tightly.

699
01:02:04,416 --> 01:02:05,416
What?

700
01:02:11,291 --> 01:02:12,333
Obulamma.

701
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:17,625
If you know with whom
my daughter was all these days,

702
01:02:17,708 --> 01:02:19,166
you will release her.

703
01:02:37,416 --> 01:02:39,291
Hold there tightly.

704
01:03:59,125 --> 01:04:00,583
He stopped.

705
01:04:01,208 --> 01:04:02,416
He stopped the truck.

706
01:04:03,458 --> 01:04:04,875
He stopped the truck?

707
01:04:05,416 --> 01:04:06,583
Who the heck is he?

708
01:04:06,666 --> 01:04:08,875
You should have killed him on the spot.

709
01:04:18,458 --> 01:04:20,125
It's he.

710
01:04:20,625 --> 01:04:21,833
Devaratha!

711
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,708
Nobody can stop him.

712
01:05:27,041 --> 01:05:28,041
Hey.

713
01:05:44,958 --> 01:05:48,166
You can stop a river with a dam, but

714
01:05:53,708 --> 01:05:56,250
how can you stop a mighty ocean?

715
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,500
I never told this even you, Obulamma.

716
01:06:12,708 --> 01:06:15,250
If I had, you would not have allowed me.

717
01:06:15,666 --> 01:06:18,291
Thanks to your daughter, I found him.

718
01:06:18,916 --> 01:06:21,875
Now he should be killed.

719
01:06:22,166 --> 01:06:25,291
But no one can do anything to him.

720
01:06:40,708 --> 01:06:43,958
That's why I put them
in that vehicle with seal

721
01:06:44,041 --> 01:06:46,833
and made Devaratha
stop that truck.

722
01:06:51,333 --> 01:06:53,000
The people who came to kill you...

723
01:06:53,083 --> 01:06:53,958
Your father...

724
01:06:54,166 --> 01:06:55,791
He, his mother...

725
01:06:56,125 --> 01:06:56,958
Me...

726
01:06:57,083 --> 01:06:59,250
And the seal. All have only
one thing in common.

727
01:07:00,083 --> 01:07:01,166
Khansaar.

728
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:12,166
Don't you know what happens
if someone stops that seal?

729
01:07:12,583 --> 01:07:16,708
Don't you know whose seal that is?

730
01:07:22,541 --> 01:07:23,958
Someone has stopped the seal.

731
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:27,083
For the first time ever.

732
01:07:28,375 --> 01:07:30,500
-And the one who stopped it is..
-I know.

733
01:07:37,250 --> 01:07:38,458
Varadha...

734
01:07:41,708 --> 01:07:43,791
Varadha Rajamannaar!

735
01:07:57,041 --> 01:08:00,083
No one other than him can stop it.

736
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:08,208
Deva.

737
01:08:11,958 --> 01:08:14,083
Khansaar changed
the fate of a lot of people.

738
01:08:14,250 --> 01:08:16,083
But, what changed
the fate of Khansaar was

739
01:08:16,416 --> 01:08:18,041
when two best friends

740
01:08:21,875 --> 01:08:24,041
became arch-rivals.

741
01:08:41,541 --> 01:08:43,500
My plan was amazing, wasn't it?

742
01:08:43,958 --> 01:08:47,541
Now a war will happen
between the two of them.

743
01:08:47,916 --> 01:08:50,125
And only one will survive.

744
01:08:54,708 --> 01:08:57,375
You said no one can stop that seal!

745
01:08:57,916 --> 01:08:59,833
The Salaar of Khansaar!

746
01:09:02,333 --> 01:09:04,208
No one can stop that seal.

747
01:09:04,375 --> 01:09:06,791
The Salaar to Varadha Rajamannaar.

748
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:12,875
But he is the one who created that seal!

749
01:09:13,625 --> 01:09:17,541
Salaar Devaratha Raisaar!

750
01:09:44,541 --> 01:09:45,916
What will happen now?

751
01:09:50,958 --> 01:09:52,875
It's the rule he set.

752
01:09:54,458 --> 01:09:56,041
Whoever breaks it must die!

753
01:09:56,125 --> 01:09:57,666
Up... Up...

754
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,250
I am here for you.

755
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,250
That is the rule.

756
01:10:10,916 --> 01:10:13,250
Some stories are frightening to listen to.

757
01:10:17,875 --> 01:10:20,208
Some stories are frightening to watch.

758
01:10:25,583 --> 01:10:27,250
Some stories are frightening

759
01:10:28,333 --> 01:10:29,833
to even think of.

760
01:10:45,750 --> 01:10:47,458
Do you want to listen to his story?

761
01:10:59,375 --> 01:11:01,708
This story began a thousand years ago.

762
01:11:02,625 --> 01:11:06,875
Dacoits more savage than Mahmud Ghazni
and Genghis Khan lived back then.

763
01:11:09,416 --> 01:11:11,666
They would not just loot the villages

764
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:14,875
but would burn them to ashes.

765
01:11:15,208 --> 01:11:18,208
They took all that they looted,
back to Khansaar.

766
01:11:20,083 --> 01:11:21,083
Khansaar!

767
01:11:21,708 --> 01:11:24,416
A forest situated between
mountains and the ocean.

768
01:11:24,666 --> 01:11:27,375
There were three tribes
among those dacoits.

769
01:11:28,083 --> 01:11:29,416
The Mannaar tribe.

770
01:11:30,416 --> 01:11:31,666
The Shouryaanga tribe.

771
01:11:33,666 --> 01:11:35,000
And the Ghaniyaar tribe.

772
01:11:35,208 --> 01:11:39,333
The three tribes flourished and prospered
unchallenged for hundreds of years.

773
01:11:39,416 --> 01:11:42,166
They turned that forest
into a formidable fortress.

774
01:11:44,458 --> 01:11:45,416
Fire!

775
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:48,375
The British who could
reigned over the entire world

776
01:11:48,916 --> 01:11:51,375
could occupy the whole of India but...

777
01:11:52,458 --> 01:11:53,541
in Khansaar...

778
01:11:53,791 --> 01:11:55,666
they couldn't even set foot.

779
01:11:59,041 --> 01:12:03,375
Every time the British attempted to do
so, they ended up losing their own army.

780
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,791
After Independence, the newly
formed nation had a huge issue.

781
01:12:14,208 --> 01:12:16,166
What should be done about Khansaar?

782
01:12:17,291 --> 01:12:20,625
The then leader of the three
tribes, Shiva Mannaar went to Delhi.

783
01:12:20,833 --> 01:12:23,625
He erased Khansaar from India's map.

784
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:27,458
He warned that the Constitution of India
won't be applicable to Khansaar

785
01:12:27,541 --> 01:12:31,458
but every rule set by Khansaar
would be applicable to India.

786
01:12:33,958 --> 01:12:36,333
Money generated through all
the illegal activities in India

787
01:12:36,416 --> 01:12:38,833
like smuggling, gambling,
money laundering, drugs,

788
01:12:38,916 --> 01:12:40,500
land petroleum, fake currency

789
01:12:40,583 --> 01:12:44,291
and arms deal, were dealt by the agents

790
01:12:44,375 --> 01:12:46,458
as per the percentage fixed by Khansaar.

791
01:12:46,958 --> 01:12:49,083
To prevent the law and order
from interfering with their activity,

792
01:12:49,166 --> 01:12:51,125
they began to dictate politics.

793
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,166
Fear...

794
01:12:54,208 --> 01:12:56,208
Because of this weapon they had created,

795
01:12:56,291 --> 01:12:58,125
no one dared to confront them.

796
01:13:02,208 --> 01:13:04,958
People feared to even say
the name "Khansaar".

797
01:13:07,708 --> 01:13:09,791
They turned this business
into a most profitable one

798
01:13:09,875 --> 01:13:12,125
by investing in the emotion of fear.

799
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,416
Fully aware of the violent nature
of the tribes,

800
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:18,875
Shivmannaar decided bring Khansaar, which
was progressing to affluence,

801
01:13:18,958 --> 01:13:20,500
under a common law.

802
01:13:22,375 --> 01:13:25,416
Drafting a set of rules to be
strictly adhered to by everyone,

803
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:27,916
and named that book "Constitution".

804
01:13:28,833 --> 01:13:30,291
And according to Constitution

805
01:13:30,541 --> 01:13:32,750
he divided Khansaar into 101 parts

806
01:13:33,083 --> 01:13:35,583
and appointed leaders for each part.

807
01:13:35,708 --> 01:13:38,875
He crafted a bracelet
as a symbol of their authority.

808
01:13:39,375 --> 01:13:42,041
He then divided the leaders
into three major groups.

809
01:13:42,291 --> 01:13:45,625
He named sixty-one leaders with only
one vote each as "Governors"

810
01:13:45,750 --> 01:13:49,125
and eight leaders with at least
three votes each as "Lords".

811
01:13:52,083 --> 01:13:54,375
And with 15 votes for himself,

812
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:57,416
Shivmannaar pronounced himself
as the King of Khansaar.

813
01:14:01,083 --> 01:14:03,041
One day, Shivmannaar died.

814
01:14:07,125 --> 01:14:09,625
As per the agreement between
the three tribes,

815
01:14:09,708 --> 01:14:11,041
after Shivmannaar's death,

816
01:14:11,125 --> 01:14:14,666
Dhaara, leader of Shouryaanga tribe,
was supposed to become the king.

817
01:14:16,333 --> 01:14:20,958
But, Rajamannaar did not to give
his father's throne to anyone else.

818
01:14:22,083 --> 01:14:24,416
How dare they want to have my throne!

819
01:14:25,791 --> 01:14:28,916
Not a single soul from
Shouryaanga tribe should be spared.

820
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:32,583
Can we confront them?

821
01:14:32,666 --> 01:14:35,625
There is only one way to eliminate them.

822
01:14:38,666 --> 01:14:40,916
Men, women, elderly and children...

823
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,875
Kill all of them while
they are asleep.

824
01:14:46,166 --> 01:14:48,125
If even one life is spared,

825
01:14:48,666 --> 01:14:51,083
the Shouryaangas' vengeance
will be unimaginable.

826
01:15:00,791 --> 01:15:02,625
Why are you...

827
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:28,208
Thus, the Shouryaanga tribe
was completely eliminated.

828
01:15:30,666 --> 01:15:33,916
Fearing another massacre,
everyone else bowed to Rajamannar.

829
01:15:34,916 --> 01:15:37,458
He built a huge fort around Khansaar,

830
01:15:37,833 --> 01:15:39,541
deployed a strong army,

831
01:15:40,625 --> 01:15:42,791
and made Khansaar
a formidable force.

832
01:15:52,083 --> 01:15:54,833
Rajamannaar, along with 61 Governors,

833
01:15:55,625 --> 01:15:57,833
gave five out of eight Lord positions

834
01:15:57,916 --> 01:16:00,208
to the Ghaniyaar tribe.

835
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:03,333
Vaali.

836
01:16:04,708 --> 01:16:05,666
Gurung.

837
01:16:06,541 --> 01:16:07,375
Cheeka.

838
01:16:09,458 --> 01:16:10,416
Ranga.

839
01:16:12,041 --> 01:16:13,000
And Naarang.

840
01:16:14,375 --> 01:16:17,625
He gave the remaining three
Lord positions to his family members.

841
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:20,791
Om, Rajamannaar's
first wife's elder brother.

842
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,500
Bhaarava, Rajamannaar's son-in-law.

843
01:16:25,791 --> 01:16:29,208
Rudra, Rajamannaar's son
by his first wife.

844
01:16:30,333 --> 01:16:31,291
Radha Rama.

845
01:16:31,916 --> 01:16:34,000
Rajamannaar's daughter
by his first wife.

846
01:16:34,333 --> 01:16:37,916
Rajamannaar's honor and pride.

847
01:16:38,583 --> 01:16:41,958
Though there were a lot of differences
among the Lords and Governors

848
01:16:42,375 --> 01:16:45,291
nobody dared to go
against Rajamannaar's will.

849
01:16:47,916 --> 01:16:51,333
These people, who were synonymous
for violence for over a 1,000 years

850
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:53,625
lived a peaceful life for 25 years

851
01:16:53,875 --> 01:16:54,875
until that day.

852
01:16:56,625 --> 01:16:58,291
Father, is it true?

853
01:16:58,583 --> 01:17:00,291
Are you going out of Khansaar?

854
01:17:00,750 --> 01:17:02,541
I will go instead, if necessary.

855
01:17:03,208 --> 01:17:06,375
Temples were built to propagate religion.

856
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:13,833
Kingdoms are ruled to propagate legacy.

857
01:17:15,291 --> 01:17:19,000
Khansaar is built
to propagate only one thing...

858
01:17:20,750 --> 01:17:21,666
Fear.

859
01:17:22,875 --> 01:17:25,291
I have maintained it until now.

860
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:27,916
No one should cross that line of fear.

861
01:17:28,083 --> 01:17:30,041
Who is crossing that line now?

862
01:17:31,083 --> 01:17:33,291
I am going out
of Khansaar to find that out.

863
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:37,583
Rama, until I come back, I am
leaving Khansaar under your watch.

864
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:41,166
And I am sure that
you will take care of it well.

865
01:17:42,125 --> 01:17:43,000
Okay, Father.

866
01:17:48,833 --> 01:17:49,666
My King.

867
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:53,291
I know that nobody will
disobey your decisions.

868
01:17:53,708 --> 01:17:56,833
But, as your son-in-law,
I would like to ask you something.

869
01:17:57,291 --> 01:17:59,125
Can't you forgive him at least now?

870
01:17:59,208 --> 01:18:02,083
-Whom?
-Your son.

871
01:18:03,875 --> 01:18:04,750
Varadha.

872
01:18:04,958 --> 01:18:07,708
Did you give up your bracelet so easily?

873
01:18:10,333 --> 01:18:11,708
Why did you do that?

874
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:17,625
He threw away the honor I gave him.

875
01:18:18,708 --> 01:18:21,000
He lost his right to be my son.

876
01:18:21,083 --> 01:18:22,750
But, he was just a ten-year-old.

877
01:18:22,833 --> 01:18:24,625
Why are you justifying him?

878
01:18:26,625 --> 01:18:30,708
Because no one else has the courage
to stand in front of you and say this.

879
01:18:30,875 --> 01:18:36,000
Because, even now, you leave a chair
vacant for Varadha on your dining table.

880
01:18:37,166 --> 01:18:41,125
Whenever I see your father Shivmannaar,

881
01:18:41,291 --> 01:18:43,666
he reminds me of
Varadha... because of that!

882
01:18:43,958 --> 01:18:46,625
He is also your blood, my King.

883
01:18:47,750 --> 01:18:51,666
He also deserves the authority
which Rudra has got.

884
01:18:54,666 --> 01:18:58,333
For the past 30 years,
I have been sitting on this throne

885
01:18:58,416 --> 01:19:02,375
and taking decisions only for Khansaar.

886
01:19:03,833 --> 01:19:08,291
For the first time,
I am making a decision for myself.

887
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,916
All I want is one of your chairs.

888
01:19:17,208 --> 01:19:19,416
You are the only one who would give me

889
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:21,916
anything I ask for,
without any conditions.

890
01:19:22,375 --> 01:19:24,208
Hence, I am asking you...

891
01:19:24,833 --> 01:19:25,958
Ranga!

892
01:19:29,833 --> 01:19:36,541
I wish to see my son, Varadha Rajamannaar,
as a Lord while I am still alive.

893
01:19:40,875 --> 01:19:41,708
Varadha...

894
01:19:41,791 --> 01:19:43,916
The son of Rajamannaar's second wife.

895
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,666
As he had given up his bracelet
when he was a child,

896
01:19:46,750 --> 01:19:48,458
he couldn't become a Lord.

897
01:19:48,541 --> 01:19:50,916
Though he was demoted as a Governor,

898
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:54,500
he always lived
with the confidence of a Lord.

899
01:19:55,875 --> 01:19:57,458
Will you give it to me, Ranga?

900
01:20:02,416 --> 01:20:04,125
You shouldn't request, my King.

901
01:20:04,750 --> 01:20:06,333
You should only command.

902
01:20:08,541 --> 01:20:12,708
I am going out of Khansaar
on a very important errand.

903
01:20:13,416 --> 01:20:17,833
Once I come back, all the formalities
for making Varadha Rajamannaar a Lord

904
01:20:17,958 --> 01:20:19,875
should be done by you, Bali.

905
01:20:19,958 --> 01:20:20,791
Yes, my King!

906
01:20:51,333 --> 01:20:55,916
Do you know why he asked
for your chair out of all of us, Ranga?

907
01:20:57,458 --> 01:20:58,958
I am sure you know it.

908
01:21:04,416 --> 01:21:07,708
Your father picked up the bracelet
he threw on the ground

909
01:21:07,833 --> 01:21:10,041
and became a Lord

910
01:21:10,625 --> 01:21:16,500
He did not earn it. It was thrown at him
like a piece of bone to a stray dog.

911
01:21:16,583 --> 01:21:18,750
But my dad had genuinely won that day!

912
01:21:18,833 --> 01:21:21,583
Had he asked for my life,
I would have willingly given.

913
01:21:21,916 --> 01:21:23,625
How can I give away my chair?

914
01:21:24,083 --> 01:21:25,125
Give it up.

915
01:21:26,875 --> 01:21:28,458
Will you give it up...

916
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Ranga?

917
01:21:31,250 --> 01:21:33,041
King Rajamannaar's orders

918
01:21:33,875 --> 01:21:35,375
cannot be defied.

919
01:21:35,916 --> 01:21:39,500
There is another order
more powerful than Rajamannaar's orders.

920
01:21:40,125 --> 01:21:41,666
Khansaar Constitution.

921
01:21:42,708 --> 01:21:45,750
And in that book, there
is a very important rule.

922
01:21:46,541 --> 01:21:48,416
"The strongest shall prevail.

923
01:21:49,041 --> 01:21:50,416
"The strongest shall...

924
01:21:51,750 --> 01:21:52,916
rule."

925
01:21:53,250 --> 01:21:55,083
Ranga, yours is a new vengeance.

926
01:21:55,750 --> 01:22:00,000
But Rudra's vengeance started
from the time Varadha was born.

927
01:22:00,750 --> 01:22:03,916
You might be wondering why I'm showing
so much concern for you.

928
01:22:04,250 --> 01:22:05,875
Today he asked you to give away
your chair.

929
01:22:05,958 --> 01:22:07,458
Tomorrow it could be my turn.

930
01:22:07,541 --> 01:22:10,125
But that is not what
the Constitution says.

931
01:22:10,750 --> 01:22:13,333
I may beat you.
Then you beat me.

932
01:22:14,625 --> 01:22:15,625
Let us fight.

933
01:22:17,083 --> 01:22:19,250
The strongest shall have the country.

934
01:22:20,250 --> 01:22:21,500
The strongest shall have

935
01:22:22,750 --> 01:22:23,916
the chair.

936
01:22:26,166 --> 01:22:28,166
Is Rudra off to kill Varadha?

937
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:29,625
I can't believe this.

938
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,250
Rudra has sent for Pandit.

939
01:22:33,333 --> 01:22:34,166
Pandit?

940
01:22:44,416 --> 01:22:46,083
When Rajamannaar returns

941
01:22:47,041 --> 01:22:48,708
Varadha will be made a Lord.

942
01:22:49,666 --> 01:22:52,500
Our Brother is a Lord now!

943
01:22:52,583 --> 01:22:55,000
But by the time Rajamannaar returns,

944
01:22:55,333 --> 01:22:57,041
what if Varadha is not alive?

945
01:23:08,166 --> 01:23:10,166
The strongest shall have the country.

946
01:23:12,541 --> 01:23:14,916
The strongest shall have the chair.

947
01:23:46,375 --> 01:23:47,375
Ranga...

948
01:23:48,791 --> 01:23:50,625
You want to slit his throat.

949
01:23:51,125 --> 01:23:54,416
But I want the Mannaar authority
that he has.

950
01:24:12,666 --> 01:24:14,333
The Constitution!

951
01:24:22,041 --> 01:24:23,541
Rudra, it's the Constitution!

952
01:24:24,291 --> 01:24:25,541
No one should disobey it.

953
01:24:35,708 --> 01:24:37,250
Who? Who stopped me?

954
01:24:38,458 --> 01:24:40,166
Who stopped me?

955
01:24:41,208 --> 01:24:42,458
Hey!

956
01:24:48,083 --> 01:24:51,416
At the court of our King Rajamannaar,

957
01:24:52,166 --> 01:24:54,458
in his presence or absence,

958
01:24:54,708 --> 01:24:57,500
no one shall raise
their voice or run their mouth.

959
01:24:59,125 --> 01:25:00,625
It was me who stopped you.

960
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:03,625
How can you to take that decision?

961
01:25:04,666 --> 01:25:09,166
Because I am representing the King now,
and that's why all of you are still alive.

962
01:25:09,666 --> 01:25:11,791
If it was the King,

963
01:25:12,583 --> 01:25:16,208
all of you would have been
beheaded by now.

964
01:25:17,041 --> 01:25:18,083
Bali!

965
01:25:18,208 --> 01:25:19,250
Madam!

966
01:25:19,583 --> 01:25:23,500
In order to stop any sort of violence

967
01:25:23,583 --> 01:25:28,041
between the Lords and
the Governors of Khansaar,

968
01:25:28,375 --> 01:25:30,625
I am imposing a ceasefire.

969
01:25:31,375 --> 01:25:33,708
On the orders of the acting King,

970
01:25:33,875 --> 01:25:37,416
a ceasefire is imposed
in Khansaar from today!

971
01:25:42,708 --> 01:25:43,916
The Constitution.

972
01:25:47,250 --> 01:25:50,833
All stand equal before
the Khansaar Constitution.

973
01:25:52,041 --> 01:25:55,708
The book has given all of us
the authority to defy

974
01:25:55,791 --> 01:25:58,333
even our king at any circumstances.

975
01:26:00,541 --> 01:26:02,708
I, Rudra Rajamannaar,

976
01:26:02,958 --> 01:26:08,250
in the rank of a Lord, propose
a voting to lift the imposed ceasefire!

977
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:19,416
As per the Khansaar Constitution,

978
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:23,666
after nine days, a voting will be
held in Kotagada to decide

979
01:26:23,791 --> 01:26:29,208
whether the ceasefire should be
withdrawn or sustained.

980
01:26:34,208 --> 01:26:37,166
No one waited
until the voting day.

981
01:26:37,416 --> 01:26:39,916
Right from the Lords to the Governors,

982
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:44,083
everyone began to deploy
the most merciless and powerful armies.

983
01:27:05,833 --> 01:27:07,458
Rudra brought Pandit along.

984
01:27:07,708 --> 01:27:09,500
Naarang assembled Russian soldiers.

985
01:27:09,958 --> 01:27:12,041
Gurung assembled the Serbians.

986
01:27:12,333 --> 01:27:15,750
Even the Governors
gathered at least 50 suicide killers.

987
01:27:15,875 --> 01:27:18,166
Today, there were about
700 new entries at the gate.

988
01:27:18,375 --> 01:27:20,916
Not sure how many more armies
might enter Khansaar.

989
01:27:28,041 --> 01:27:30,583
Do you know how intimidating
each one of them are?

990
01:27:34,708 --> 01:27:36,625
And the kind of weapons
they carry...

991
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:43,583
You tell me.

992
01:27:45,208 --> 01:27:46,875
Which army are we bringing?

993
01:27:48,500 --> 01:27:49,500
Tell me.

994
01:27:50,875 --> 01:27:52,958
Where is our army?

995
01:27:56,458 --> 01:27:58,125
Brother, tell me please.

996
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:02,291
Where is our army?

997
01:28:20,375 --> 01:28:22,458
We also set out to bring an army.

998
01:28:36,083 --> 01:28:39,416
In just one jeep and
with only one vacant seat.

999
01:28:43,958 --> 01:28:49,208
Even I was curious to see the army
that was supposed to fit in that seat.

1000
01:29:18,583 --> 01:29:19,791
Hey, Deva!

1001
01:29:19,958 --> 01:29:22,500
Varadha, my dad will skin me alive
if I go out now.

1002
01:29:22,583 --> 01:29:23,958
I am not coming.
You can leave.

1003
01:29:24,041 --> 01:29:26,000
-Hey...
-I said I can't.

1004
01:29:31,916 --> 01:29:32,833
Deva...

1005
01:29:36,041 --> 01:29:37,166
Do you remember me?

1006
01:29:40,916 --> 01:29:42,458
Only your voice has changed.

1007
01:29:43,750 --> 01:29:45,166
Not the way you call me.

1008
01:29:46,708 --> 01:29:50,208
Other than my mother,

1009
01:29:50,375 --> 01:29:53,291
only one person calls me Deva.

1010
01:29:55,875 --> 01:29:57,875
Varadha Rajamannaar.

1011
01:30:35,208 --> 01:30:36,375
How are you, mother?

1012
01:30:41,416 --> 01:30:42,416
I am starving.

1013
01:30:43,791 --> 01:30:45,208
Cook something for me.

1014
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:48,750
It's been so long since I ate your food.

1015
01:31:04,833 --> 01:31:05,750
Hey...

1016
01:31:09,750 --> 01:31:12,000
I told you to leave.
Why are you still here?

1017
01:31:14,250 --> 01:31:16,250
Hey... Where is your nose ring?

1018
01:31:20,958 --> 01:31:23,166
It's... You...

1019
01:31:30,791 --> 01:31:31,958
Who took it?

1020
01:31:33,750 --> 01:31:35,666
Let me tell my mother. I will come.

1021
01:31:36,875 --> 01:31:39,666
Varadha wanted
to take Deva with him at any cost.

1022
01:31:41,375 --> 01:31:44,208
But Deva's mother had
decided not to send him along.

1023
01:31:58,250 --> 01:31:59,125
Mother!

1024
01:31:59,875 --> 01:32:01,833
-I think Varadha needs me...
-But...

1025
01:32:23,875 --> 01:32:24,833
Go with him...

1026
01:32:25,125 --> 01:32:26,291
Let's go get it.

1027
01:33:32,958 --> 01:33:34,958
-Sir...
-Need to make an entry.

1028
01:33:43,666 --> 01:33:46,916
-Rani... Rani...
-Surabhi!

1029
01:33:47,208 --> 01:33:50,291
Don't cry! Don't cry, dear!

1030
01:33:50,375 --> 01:33:51,666
Please, let her go.

1031
01:33:51,833 --> 01:33:53,458
She will never come back.

1032
01:33:55,125 --> 01:33:56,291
How many persons, sir?

1033
01:33:57,208 --> 01:33:58,333
Only one.

1034
01:34:06,041 --> 01:34:07,791
Isn't there anyone else, sir?

1035
01:34:07,916 --> 01:34:09,250
I won't need anyone else.

1036
01:34:16,791 --> 01:34:17,666
Surabhi!

1037
01:34:18,583 --> 01:34:19,625
What is his name?

1038
01:34:19,750 --> 01:34:20,666
Devaratha.

1039
01:34:20,750 --> 01:34:21,583
Which tribe?

1040
01:34:21,666 --> 01:34:22,958
He is an outsider.

1041
01:34:24,666 --> 01:34:25,750
Take his prints.

1042
01:34:26,125 --> 01:34:29,166
I am praying to our Goddess to save us.

1043
01:34:30,083 --> 01:34:35,041
Dear, no matter how much we pray,
no God would set foot on this sinful land.

1044
01:34:35,250 --> 01:34:38,083
How many times should I tell you?

1045
01:34:50,416 --> 01:34:53,041
He got scared just by looking
at the entrance gate.

1046
01:34:54,291 --> 01:34:55,583
Be careful, sir.

1047
01:34:55,666 --> 01:34:57,791
Whoever steps inside

1048
01:34:57,875 --> 01:34:59,458
never comes out.

1049
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:07,333
Dear, whom are you praying to?

1050
01:35:12,750 --> 01:35:15,166
Huge walls are built out of fear.

1051
01:35:16,541 --> 01:35:18,458
Not out of fear of those going out...

1052
01:35:18,541 --> 01:35:20,333
You said God won't come to save us.

1053
01:35:20,416 --> 01:35:22,625
So, I am praying
in the opposite direction.

1054
01:35:23,916 --> 01:35:26,375
...but out of fear of those coming in.

1055
01:35:29,125 --> 01:35:31,833
Let's see if at least the demon
comes to our rescue.

1056
01:35:32,166 --> 01:35:36,000
After 25 years, in order to
keep the promise he had made...

1057
01:35:36,333 --> 01:35:38,708
he came back
to the land of his birth.

1058
01:37:05,625 --> 01:37:07,125
-Baba, this is...
-I know.

1059
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,958
Don't look around.
No one else will be coming.

1060
01:37:15,916 --> 01:37:16,916
Of course, I know.

1061
01:37:21,041 --> 01:37:23,291
Varadha has made an entry
in the register for his army at the gates.

1062
01:37:24,041 --> 01:37:27,083
Only one entry must
has been made at the gate.

1063
01:37:27,916 --> 01:37:29,291
Only one?

1064
01:37:34,708 --> 01:37:36,375
You brought only one man?

1065
01:37:36,666 --> 01:37:39,750
We needed a whole army,
and you brought just one?

1066
01:37:39,833 --> 01:37:41,666
-Him, of all people?
-I forgot to ask.

1067
01:37:41,833 --> 01:37:43,916
Did you make all the arrangements
for Deva's stay here?

1068
01:37:44,583 --> 01:37:45,666
Yes, I did.

1069
01:37:49,166 --> 01:37:50,375
Have you forgotten?

1070
01:37:51,291 --> 01:37:55,750
It's because of that one decision
you made for him 25 years ago

1071
01:37:57,541 --> 01:37:59,666
our lives are so miserable even today.

1072
01:38:02,750 --> 01:38:04,666
And yet you have brought him back.

1073
01:38:04,750 --> 01:38:06,791
-Have food.
-You be quiet, Baba.

1074
01:38:09,041 --> 01:38:11,208
-Even now he could...
-Rinda!

1075
01:38:11,833 --> 01:38:14,416
Tell Satthi that the curry
is not spicy enough.

1076
01:38:14,583 --> 01:38:15,708
Deva won't like it.

1077
01:38:15,791 --> 01:38:18,208
Tell him to add some chilli
before you serve him.

1078
01:38:20,500 --> 01:38:23,416
Everyone in Khansaar

1079
01:38:23,625 --> 01:38:29,333
desperately wants to hack us to pieces.

1080
01:38:31,291 --> 01:38:32,791
Do you know that?

1081
01:38:43,791 --> 01:38:46,750
Father, why are you in a hurry
to take such a decision?

1082
01:38:47,291 --> 01:38:50,041
I want you to sit on that chair
while I am still alive

1083
01:38:50,208 --> 01:38:51,916
and fulfill my wish
of seeing you as a Lord.

1084
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:53,416
-But, Dad...
-Hey...

1085
01:38:53,916 --> 01:38:56,916
Until now, I have fulfilled all
your wishes even before you asked.

1086
01:38:57,500 --> 01:38:59,458
Just fulfill this one wish of mine.

1087
01:39:01,875 --> 01:39:02,833
Vishnu!

1088
01:39:04,291 --> 01:39:06,875
Rudra Mannaar has sent you a message.

1089
01:39:07,041 --> 01:39:07,916
Lord Rudra?

1090
01:39:08,250 --> 01:39:10,291
I will do anything for him. What is it?

1091
01:39:10,875 --> 01:39:13,791
He asked you to give Varadha
sleepless nights.

1092
01:39:17,500 --> 01:39:19,458
Baba, we are going out.

1093
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:21,375
Please call Deva as well...

1094
01:39:21,458 --> 01:39:23,666
There's so many of us. Why do we need him?

1095
01:39:24,041 --> 01:39:25,041
Hey... Come.

1096
01:39:30,958 --> 01:39:31,958
Go, get him.

1097
01:39:32,208 --> 01:39:33,916
I will hit you!

1098
01:39:34,083 --> 01:39:35,125
Go!

1099
01:39:42,208 --> 01:39:43,041
Lord!

1100
01:39:43,875 --> 01:39:46,083
Why are you walking, my Lord?

1101
01:39:46,708 --> 01:39:48,208
Hey, hold an umbrella for him.

1102
01:39:49,708 --> 01:39:50,916
Where is the umbrella?

1103
01:39:59,208 --> 01:40:01,375
I know our present condition very well.

1104
01:40:02,333 --> 01:40:05,000
I also know that we have
only enemies around us.

1105
01:40:05,208 --> 01:40:06,125
Hey...

1106
01:40:09,625 --> 01:40:10,625
What is it?

1107
01:40:11,833 --> 01:40:14,000
More than the fear of getting killed,

1108
01:40:15,250 --> 01:40:18,541
I dread the humiliation
that we are yet to suffer.

1109
01:40:21,958 --> 01:40:22,875
Who is that?

1110
01:40:30,416 --> 01:40:34,416
All of them are desperately
waiting to chop your head off.

1111
01:40:34,791 --> 01:40:38,333
I feel like chopping off your head

1112
01:40:38,416 --> 01:40:41,458
right now, right here.

1113
01:40:42,208 --> 01:40:44,083
If we want to stay alive here...

1114
01:40:44,458 --> 01:40:47,291
however large an army we get,
it won't be enough.

1115
01:40:47,875 --> 01:40:51,416
In Khansaar, nothing can be
calculated using a calculator.

1116
01:41:03,666 --> 01:41:07,250
That's why I brought a maniac
who is totally unpredictable.

1117
01:41:13,666 --> 01:41:15,291
But, what is he going to do?

1118
01:41:17,916 --> 01:41:19,041
Hold the gun tight.

1119
01:41:19,291 --> 01:41:21,916
Keep your body upright
while pulling the trigger.

1120
01:41:22,750 --> 01:41:23,791
Safety...

1121
01:41:24,500 --> 01:41:26,708
you can fire after unlocking
the safety lock.

1122
01:41:26,875 --> 01:41:31,333
A mechanic only knows how to use
a spanner and a wrench.

1123
01:41:31,458 --> 01:41:33,500
What is the use of giving him a gun?

1124
01:42:25,833 --> 01:42:26,958
That's it, right?

1125
01:42:41,083 --> 01:42:42,125
Let's go.

1126
01:42:44,833 --> 01:42:46,083
Why are you here, my Lord?

1127
01:42:47,083 --> 01:42:50,375
Hey, I don't see any vacant tables?

1128
01:42:50,708 --> 01:42:52,500
I will get the tables ready
at once, my Lord.

1129
01:42:56,166 --> 01:42:59,500
At times, I feel it's better
that he doesn't do anything.

1130
01:43:06,416 --> 01:43:09,666
Fold your hands, all of you!
Don't you know the procedure?

1131
01:43:18,541 --> 01:43:19,541
Mother...

1132
01:43:25,916 --> 01:43:27,500
Where are you going?

1133
01:43:27,583 --> 01:43:29,416
We have some other work, let's go.

1134
01:43:29,750 --> 01:43:31,333
-Hey, there...
-Come on, come...

1135
01:43:31,666 --> 01:43:32,500
Ganga...

1136
01:43:41,666 --> 01:43:43,833
Rudra on one hand and Ranga on the other.

1137
01:43:43,916 --> 01:43:46,916
Now, my son Vishnu
as well is troubling you.

1138
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,875
It's sad to see Rajamannaar's son
going through all these.

1139
01:43:49,958 --> 01:43:50,875
Do one thing.

1140
01:43:51,625 --> 01:43:54,208
Chop your head off
and place it at my feet.

1141
01:44:06,291 --> 01:44:07,375
It's my mistake.

1142
01:44:08,458 --> 01:44:09,541
I didn't notice.

1143
01:44:31,041 --> 01:44:32,583
How long would you tolerate this?

1144
01:44:35,041 --> 01:44:37,250
Even I don't know how long

1145
01:44:39,208 --> 01:44:40,625
I can hold him back.

1146
01:44:52,708 --> 01:44:53,916
Hey, leave me.

1147
01:44:54,833 --> 01:44:58,083
Khansaar's king,
Rajamannaar's son...

1148
01:44:58,208 --> 01:44:59,833
Varadha Rajamannaar!

1149
01:45:00,291 --> 01:45:02,000
See my plight now!

1150
01:45:06,208 --> 01:45:09,125
I have absolutely no value here.

1151
01:45:09,208 --> 01:45:10,541
What are you saying?

1152
01:45:10,625 --> 01:45:13,750
-Baba.
-Didn't you hear that?

1153
01:45:13,958 --> 01:45:17,208
Deva! Please sit down... please...

1154
01:45:19,375 --> 01:45:23,666
None of my people are happy
that I brought you here.

1155
01:45:28,041 --> 01:45:29,958
They are just not saying it out loud.

1156
01:45:30,875 --> 01:45:33,000
But I'm sure they are cursing me.

1157
01:45:34,125 --> 01:45:38,458
Nobody even bothered to
ask me why I brought you here.

1158
01:45:39,416 --> 01:45:43,250
-You won't ask me.
-Brother, you've had enough.

1159
01:45:43,375 --> 01:45:44,375
Let's go.

1160
01:45:45,291 --> 01:45:49,625
Hey... come here, my dearest brother...

1161
01:45:49,708 --> 01:45:53,166
Brother! Let me go, brother.

1162
01:45:55,416 --> 01:45:57,708
Hey, you guys bring him home.

1163
01:45:57,875 --> 01:45:59,208
Baachi!

1164
01:46:04,541 --> 01:46:06,416
I am really scared, my friend.

1165
01:46:09,791 --> 01:46:12,333
Not that something will happen to me.

1166
01:46:13,333 --> 01:46:17,625
Not that the little honor
I have left will be taken away.

1167
01:46:20,250 --> 01:46:25,000
I am only worried
about my younger brother.

1168
01:46:27,208 --> 01:46:29,458
You must make sure
nothing happens to him.

1169
01:46:32,666 --> 01:46:33,583
Hey...

1170
01:46:36,708 --> 01:46:38,125
You must look after him.

1171
01:46:40,083 --> 01:46:41,625
You must take care of him...

1172
01:46:44,500 --> 01:46:45,458
Move your hand.

1173
01:46:47,125 --> 01:46:50,458
You must take care of him.

1174
01:46:51,666 --> 01:46:53,541
When I am gone...

1175
01:46:54,625 --> 01:46:55,583
he...

1176
01:46:56,625 --> 01:46:57,583
Deva!

1177
01:47:07,541 --> 01:47:10,000
You have six hands and yet...

1178
01:47:10,416 --> 01:47:12,666
Not one is extended to help

1179
01:47:18,333 --> 01:47:20,916
We are in deep anguish

1180
01:47:21,083 --> 01:47:24,958
And you are nowhere to be seen

1181
01:47:29,208 --> 01:47:31,875
Why do you harbor anger

1182
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,416
Against the fragile

1183
01:47:40,083 --> 01:47:42,916
To hail you with raised arms

1184
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,625
There is no strength left

1185
01:47:51,041 --> 01:47:56,333
Even with ceaseless worship,
We remain untouched by mercy

1186
01:47:56,458 --> 01:47:59,750
We called you again and again

1187
01:48:01,375 --> 01:48:04,083
Yet hope has faded away

1188
01:48:38,833 --> 01:48:43,041
Along with Rudra, Ranga and Bhaarava,
another ten Governors have teamed up.

1189
01:48:44,250 --> 01:48:47,166
They will try to influence
the others to take their side.

1190
01:48:47,250 --> 01:48:50,125
Rudra, whatever you say,
we won't go against our King.

1191
01:48:50,208 --> 01:48:51,208
Good.

1192
01:48:51,625 --> 01:48:55,083
When I become the king, I will
tell everyone around me

1193
01:48:55,208 --> 01:48:58,708
that there lived a very
loyal man like you.

1194
01:48:59,833 --> 01:49:00,750
But, my Lord...

1195
01:49:00,958 --> 01:49:03,000
You cannot win without the Ghaniyaars.

1196
01:49:03,083 --> 01:49:04,916
And no Ghaniyaar
will go against Naarang.

1197
01:49:05,083 --> 01:49:06,041
Naarang!

1198
01:49:06,125 --> 01:49:09,291
What if Ranga tries to influence
some of the Ghaniyaars?

1199
01:49:09,375 --> 01:49:11,666
If any one of us goes against our king,

1200
01:49:11,916 --> 01:49:14,291
I will kill him
with my own hands, my Lord.

1201
01:49:21,458 --> 01:49:24,041
-Do you have children?
-What?

1202
01:49:26,458 --> 01:49:27,750
Children.

1203
01:49:30,750 --> 01:49:31,666
Boy.

1204
01:49:36,208 --> 01:49:37,125
Girl?

1205
01:49:41,458 --> 01:49:43,500
Girl...

1206
01:49:50,958 --> 01:49:51,833
Hey, Pandit!

1207
01:49:52,375 --> 01:49:53,833
He is wearing the bracelet.

1208
01:49:54,375 --> 01:49:55,291
Not now.

1209
01:49:56,291 --> 01:49:58,458
Just be patient for four more days.

1210
01:50:03,666 --> 01:50:04,958
Girl.

1211
01:50:11,708 --> 01:50:13,291
I also have a wish.

1212
01:50:13,416 --> 01:50:14,666
What is it, Naarang?

1213
01:50:15,041 --> 01:50:17,708
A wish to be a father
like our King Rajamannaar.

1214
01:50:21,875 --> 01:50:23,625
They are here again!

1215
01:50:23,708 --> 01:50:24,583
Mother...

1216
01:50:24,750 --> 01:50:26,125
After the ceasefire voting

1217
01:50:26,500 --> 01:50:28,958
I wish to see my son in my chair.

1218
01:50:32,083 --> 01:50:36,666
As soon as the ceasefire voting gets
over, your son will become a Lord, Uncle.

1219
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,916
Brother, Vishnu asked us
to go to Mahara.

1220
01:50:50,416 --> 01:50:51,541
This bloody...

1221
01:50:53,375 --> 01:50:54,416
-Hey!
-Sir?

1222
01:50:54,833 --> 01:50:57,791
Under no circumstances should
Deva know where we are going.

1223
01:51:00,500 --> 01:51:02,166
Even if he comes,
what can he do?

1224
01:51:02,250 --> 01:51:03,958
Hey, tell him.

1225
01:51:04,083 --> 01:51:05,583
Deva shouldn't come there.

1226
01:51:06,458 --> 01:51:08,833
Hey, where is Devaratha?

1227
01:51:09,666 --> 01:51:11,666
Damn! How can I make him
understand?

1228
01:51:13,916 --> 01:51:15,416
Where is he?

1229
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:17,458
It's useless to ask him.

1230
01:51:27,958 --> 01:51:29,916
Vishnu had a procedure there.

1231
01:51:30,750 --> 01:51:32,541
First, he flies the kite high.

1232
01:51:40,750 --> 01:51:43,250
Hey, stop right there.

1233
01:51:46,083 --> 01:51:47,958
Then he cuts the string himself.

1234
01:52:20,708 --> 01:52:21,958
Whichever house

1235
01:52:22,583 --> 01:52:24,791
the kite lands on...

1236
01:52:28,166 --> 01:52:31,958
He takes one girl from that house.

1237
01:52:32,916 --> 01:52:34,083
Oh, God! No!

1238
01:52:38,666 --> 01:52:39,625
Oh, no!

1239
01:52:43,833 --> 01:52:45,916
Oh, yeah... we got our chick.

1240
01:52:48,666 --> 01:52:50,083
No... I'll go.

1241
01:52:50,458 --> 01:52:52,666
You must take care
of our mother and Surabhi.

1242
01:52:53,541 --> 01:52:55,041
You are so young.

1243
01:52:55,166 --> 01:52:57,416
I am the elder one.
Listen to me.

1244
01:52:57,500 --> 01:52:58,916
This is on me.

1245
01:52:59,041 --> 01:53:00,916
No, no. I will go.

1246
01:53:01,083 --> 01:53:02,583
Oh, no!

1247
01:53:02,833 --> 01:53:05,041
It doesn't matter if you go or she.

1248
01:53:05,125 --> 01:53:07,958
It doesn't matter who goes.
It's the same for me.

1249
01:53:08,041 --> 01:53:13,125
O Goddess! Save us, please!

1250
01:53:15,708 --> 01:53:19,000
Oh, no!

1251
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:28,875
Surabhi!

1252
01:53:30,291 --> 01:53:32,500
I don't know which girl is coming.

1253
01:53:33,875 --> 01:53:35,916
I cannot bear the suspense.

1254
01:53:39,791 --> 01:53:41,000
-Surabhi...
-What are you doing?

1255
01:53:41,250 --> 01:53:44,583
-Surabhi... Surabhi...
-Don't go!

1256
01:54:28,666 --> 01:54:30,708
Hey, who called him here?

1257
01:54:32,208 --> 01:54:33,208
Hey!

1258
01:54:33,416 --> 01:54:34,708
Follow the procedure.

1259
01:54:34,833 --> 01:54:36,500
Stand with your hands folded.

1260
01:54:51,458 --> 01:54:53,041
Good.

1261
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:02,791
Sir! Please spare her!

1262
01:55:03,083 --> 01:55:04,666
Sir! Please spare her!

1263
01:55:04,791 --> 01:55:06,375
-Be quiet!
-Sir, sir...

1264
01:55:08,291 --> 01:55:09,166
Look at me!

1265
01:55:09,250 --> 01:55:10,791
She is just a kid.

1266
01:55:16,958 --> 01:55:20,458
Where did you all go today,
leaving me behind?

1267
01:55:20,583 --> 01:55:22,708
That territory is called Mahara.

1268
01:55:23,875 --> 01:55:26,666
I beg you, my Lord. Leave her.

1269
01:55:28,500 --> 01:55:29,958
It's like a poultry farm.

1270
01:55:31,791 --> 01:55:35,375
That scoundrel Vishnu
chooses a hen every day

1271
01:55:36,416 --> 01:55:37,416
and kills it.

1272
01:55:39,916 --> 01:55:42,250
Please spare her, sir!

1273
01:55:44,166 --> 01:55:45,458
Let's take her home.

1274
01:55:45,541 --> 01:55:46,875
Hey, I don't have the patience.

1275
01:55:47,833 --> 01:55:49,458
Leave her alone.

1276
01:55:49,583 --> 01:55:51,333
Give us two minutes, dear Lord.

1277
01:55:51,416 --> 01:55:53,291
I will get her ready like a lady.

1278
01:55:59,500 --> 01:56:01,958
-But, instead of the hens, it's...
-Baba.

1279
01:56:02,083 --> 01:56:04,750
We have other important things to do.
Let's go.

1280
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:25,458
O Goddess Kaliyamma!

1281
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,375
Your rituals are wrong.

1282
01:57:19,333 --> 01:57:22,000
If you want to please the Goddess...

1283
01:57:25,291 --> 01:57:27,333
go to the animal market first.

1284
01:57:31,958 --> 01:57:36,666
From the herd, select a nice and
healthy ram with strong twisted horns.

1285
01:57:40,083 --> 01:57:42,041
Hey, stop it!

1286
01:57:43,041 --> 01:57:44,041
Dear Lord!

1287
01:57:44,291 --> 01:57:46,958
Hold it by the horns and drag it down.

1288
01:57:47,833 --> 01:57:51,250
Garland it, apply turmeric
and vermilion on its face.

1289
01:57:51,416 --> 01:57:53,916
Then, sharpen the knife.

1290
01:57:54,041 --> 01:57:57,000
Hey, I am warning you!
I won't tell you again.

1291
01:57:57,458 --> 01:58:00,083
Sprinkle holy water on its face.

1292
01:58:01,083 --> 01:58:02,041
Mutthu!

1293
01:58:02,916 --> 01:58:06,666
As soon as it shakes its head...

1294
01:58:12,500 --> 01:58:14,125
Shall I complete the ritual now?

1295
01:59:09,416 --> 01:59:10,666
Hey, kill him!

1296
01:59:36,541 --> 01:59:37,458
Hey!

1297
02:00:14,791 --> 02:00:16,208
Look at what he is doing, Brother!

1298
02:00:16,750 --> 02:00:17,750
Come on, fast!

1299
02:00:41,250 --> 02:00:42,083
Go!

1300
02:00:58,500 --> 02:00:59,625
Surabhi!

1301
02:00:59,833 --> 02:01:01,416
Goddess Kaliyamma didn't come.

1302
02:01:02,125 --> 02:01:03,125
Instead...

1303
02:01:04,166 --> 02:01:05,666
she has sent her son for us.

1304
02:02:35,625 --> 02:02:38,250
Brother, he will kill Vishnu.

1305
02:02:39,833 --> 02:02:42,500
If he dies, you know
what our plight will be, right?

1306
02:02:44,750 --> 02:02:46,416
Varadha! Stop him right now!

1307
02:02:51,083 --> 02:02:53,916
I know him since childhood.

1308
02:02:55,750 --> 02:02:56,833
He won't stop.

1309
02:02:57,625 --> 02:03:00,083
Until he stops breathing...

1310
02:03:05,541 --> 02:03:06,541
He won't stop.

1311
02:03:25,708 --> 02:03:27,083
Are you going to kill me?

1312
02:03:27,208 --> 02:03:28,666
Do you know who my father is?

1313
02:03:32,458 --> 02:03:33,458
Baba!

1314
02:03:33,833 --> 02:03:35,208
Stop him, Baba.

1315
02:03:39,125 --> 02:03:40,291
I will kill you!

1316
02:03:41,750 --> 02:03:44,666
Kill that scoundrel!

1317
02:04:15,833 --> 02:04:17,375
Just two minutes...

1318
02:04:17,833 --> 02:04:19,916
I will get him ready like a Lord.

1319
02:04:47,916 --> 02:04:48,791
Hey!

1320
02:05:52,416 --> 02:05:56,041
I am just checking
if you are real or not, son.

1321
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:29,291
Vishnu has been killed.

1322
02:06:36,791 --> 02:06:37,875
Was it him?

1323
02:06:48,416 --> 02:06:50,458
Why did Deva react so violently

1324
02:06:50,541 --> 02:06:52,750
for that poor girl he didn't even know?

1325
02:06:52,875 --> 02:06:54,791
I don't understand it even today.

1326
02:06:55,791 --> 02:06:56,875
I understand!

1327
02:06:58,416 --> 02:07:00,625
In every girl who is in distress,

1328
02:07:02,083 --> 02:07:03,541
he sees his mother.

1329
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:10,541
How dare he touch the child!

1330
02:07:12,333 --> 02:07:13,625
That too a girl child!

1331
02:07:20,333 --> 02:07:21,666
Sorry.

1332
02:07:26,958 --> 02:07:28,375
What he did that day

1333
02:07:28,625 --> 02:07:29,875
affected not only me

1334
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:31,500
but the entire Khansaar.

1335
02:07:33,250 --> 02:07:34,666
This shouldn't be happening.

1336
02:07:34,791 --> 02:07:36,458
Especially during the ceasefire.

1337
02:07:36,750 --> 02:07:39,666
This is going to impact
the upcoming voting.

1338
02:07:39,875 --> 02:07:42,791
Ceasefire was enforced to stop
Varadha from getting killed.

1339
02:07:42,875 --> 02:07:44,541
How could he go and do this?

1340
02:07:44,625 --> 02:07:46,250
Varadha didn't kill him.

1341
02:07:46,333 --> 02:07:47,666
The new guy did.

1342
02:07:51,375 --> 02:07:52,833
What do we do?

1343
02:07:52,916 --> 02:07:55,750
Now he is under the control
of the Mannar army.

1344
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:59,875
But we cannot take
any decision about this right now.

1345
02:08:00,375 --> 02:08:03,416
The decision will be made
by Naarang at Velamgadi.

1346
02:08:03,708 --> 02:08:06,458
He will surely not spare Varadha.

1347
02:08:06,583 --> 02:08:09,958
Rudra!

1348
02:08:11,375 --> 02:08:15,125
I heard that Varadha would be
handed over to Naarang at Velamgadi.

1349
02:08:15,333 --> 02:08:19,375
Is he going to kill him?
But it's my prerogative to kill him.

1350
02:08:21,041 --> 02:08:23,375
Since it was the new guy
who flouted the rules,

1351
02:08:23,458 --> 02:08:27,875
you must convince Naarang
to punish the culprit.

1352
02:08:28,041 --> 02:08:31,458
If Varadha dies, I will be happy.

1353
02:08:31,666 --> 02:08:34,541
But I must follow my dad,
the King's command.

1354
02:08:35,250 --> 02:08:37,458
Uncle, I will speak to Naarang.

1355
02:08:37,708 --> 02:08:39,250
Please go to Varadha.

1356
02:08:41,333 --> 02:08:42,791
Rudra...

1357
02:08:43,250 --> 02:08:48,083
I haven't asked you
for anything since childhood.

1358
02:08:48,750 --> 02:08:53,125
Do something, please.

1359
02:08:53,875 --> 02:08:56,250
I want Varadha.

1360
02:08:59,833 --> 02:09:01,708
Tomorrow at Velamgadi...

1361
02:09:02,041 --> 02:09:04,958
Naarang is going to pronounce the verdict.

1362
02:09:05,208 --> 02:09:08,125
All arrangements have been made.

1363
02:09:08,333 --> 02:09:09,250
What does it mean?

1364
02:09:09,750 --> 02:09:12,166
If you want to come out,

1365
02:09:12,458 --> 02:09:14,708
don't open your mouth there.

1366
02:09:16,250 --> 02:09:17,416
What does it mean?

1367
02:09:32,250 --> 02:09:35,166
I know this is not
the right time to say this.

1368
02:09:35,583 --> 02:09:39,791
You have all the rights to do whatever
you want with the one who killed your son.

1369
02:09:39,958 --> 02:09:41,666
Varadha didn't kill your son.

1370
02:09:42,250 --> 02:09:45,166
The one who killed him is the new guy.

1371
02:09:45,291 --> 02:09:46,833
Remember that!

1372
02:09:47,875 --> 02:09:49,833
My Lord...

1373
02:09:59,958 --> 02:10:05,666
If the ceasefire has to be lifted,

1374
02:10:08,166 --> 02:10:10,333
Varadha must be killed.

1375
02:10:20,166 --> 02:10:23,791
It's true that Varadha
didn't kill your son.

1376
02:10:24,041 --> 02:10:24,958
But...

1377
02:10:25,250 --> 02:10:29,083
when your son Vishnu
was mercilessly murdered

1378
02:10:30,500 --> 02:10:33,041
he stood there without doing anything.

1379
02:10:55,791 --> 02:10:58,125
The verdict at Velamgadi today

1380
02:10:58,291 --> 02:11:00,000
has nothing to do with Kotagada.

1381
02:11:00,083 --> 02:11:02,666
Whatever happens there, no one
should lift a finger.

1382
02:11:02,791 --> 02:11:05,208
All of you remove cartridges
from guns.

1383
02:11:05,291 --> 02:11:08,125
Until I say, nobody should use weapons.

1384
02:11:08,958 --> 02:11:11,833
Somebody's head will roll today.

1385
02:11:12,125 --> 02:11:14,208
As soon as it happens,
inform me.

1386
02:11:17,166 --> 02:11:19,166
I will take care of everything there.

1387
02:11:19,750 --> 02:11:21,375
You just need to remain silent.

1388
02:11:23,041 --> 02:11:24,083
Understand?

1389
02:12:00,791 --> 02:12:03,041
Isn't he the one who killed Vishnu?

1390
02:12:04,958 --> 02:12:06,791
I heard he killed as many as 25.

1391
02:12:35,583 --> 02:12:39,041
Will he chop his head
or Varadha's head today?

1392
02:13:11,375 --> 02:13:13,458
He is drawing sword!

1393
02:13:39,541 --> 02:13:41,791
He is going towards Varadha, bro!

1394
02:13:49,375 --> 02:13:50,333
Hey!

1395
02:13:50,791 --> 02:13:53,583
He is going to kill your rooster.

1396
02:14:01,750 --> 02:14:02,708
Deva...

1397
02:14:03,666 --> 02:14:04,708
Deva!

1398
02:14:05,458 --> 02:14:07,000
It was me who killed your son.

1399
02:14:07,083 --> 02:14:09,541
Do whatever you want with me.
Don't touch Varadha.

1400
02:14:11,166 --> 02:14:13,041
-Varadha is innocent.
-Deva, wait.

1401
02:14:13,291 --> 02:14:14,375
You can punish me.

1402
02:14:14,750 --> 02:14:16,041
Give me any punishment.

1403
02:14:22,541 --> 02:14:23,375
I..

1404
02:14:23,875 --> 02:14:25,416
I am begging you.

1405
02:14:26,250 --> 02:14:28,333
Please spare Varadha.

1406
02:14:31,166 --> 02:14:32,041
Deva!

1407
02:14:33,541 --> 02:14:34,833
Deva! Listen to me.

1408
02:14:35,208 --> 02:14:36,458
Stop right there.

1409
02:14:40,208 --> 02:14:41,041
I am the one

1410
02:14:42,041 --> 02:14:43,958
who killed your son Vishnu.

1411
02:14:46,458 --> 02:14:47,458
Hey...

1412
02:14:47,833 --> 02:14:48,875
Kill me.

1413
02:14:49,166 --> 02:14:50,541
But...

1414
02:14:50,791 --> 02:14:53,166
Please don't touch Varadha.

1415
02:15:10,291 --> 02:15:11,958
Hey, bring him aside.

1416
02:15:14,166 --> 02:15:15,791
Hey, move aside.

1417
02:15:21,958 --> 02:15:22,875
Sir...

1418
02:15:23,083 --> 02:15:24,333
He didn't do anything.

1419
02:15:24,458 --> 02:15:25,791
It was for me.

1420
02:15:28,125 --> 02:15:29,041
Kill me, sir.

1421
02:16:14,041 --> 02:16:15,125
I told you to spare Varadha!

1422
02:16:16,666 --> 02:16:18,416
Didn't I tell you not to touch my Varadha?

1423
02:16:20,166 --> 02:16:21,416
What are you looking at?

1424
02:16:21,625 --> 02:16:22,791
Finish then off!

1425
02:16:22,875 --> 02:16:24,250
Load your guns!

1426
02:16:25,375 --> 02:16:26,833
No one should touch him.

1427
02:16:29,583 --> 02:16:30,541
Please!

1428
02:16:34,291 --> 02:16:35,375
I...

1429
02:16:36,500 --> 02:16:37,708
kindly..

1430
02:16:40,083 --> 02:16:41,125
..request!

1431
02:17:14,750 --> 02:17:16,041
Is it Varadha's head?

1432
02:17:17,958 --> 02:17:19,125
Or the new guy's?

1433
02:17:19,333 --> 02:17:21,666
The new guy decapitated Naarang, Rudra.

1434
02:17:37,875 --> 02:17:40,041
You muted me in Khansaar.

1435
02:17:41,208 --> 02:17:45,250
But he decapitated
two people at high volume.

1436
02:17:45,666 --> 02:17:47,500
Maybe he doesn't know the rules...

1437
02:17:47,875 --> 02:17:50,250
What if he knows them
but didn't follow them?

1438
02:17:59,375 --> 02:18:00,541
Of course!

1439
02:18:01,625 --> 02:18:03,666
Varadha said it correctly...

1440
02:18:03,791 --> 02:18:06,000
Seriously, he got himself a maniac.

1441
02:18:10,333 --> 02:18:13,541
Before Devaratha came
here, we were on a frying pan,

1442
02:18:14,583 --> 02:18:16,375
getting our lives fried
and burnt.

1443
02:18:18,375 --> 02:18:19,583
He killed his son

1444
02:18:21,083 --> 02:18:22,708
and threw us into the fire.

1445
02:18:23,125 --> 02:18:25,416
I wish they spare at least our bones.

1446
02:18:26,208 --> 02:18:27,125
But no.

1447
02:18:28,750 --> 02:18:30,375
He has killed his son.

1448
02:18:31,958 --> 02:18:35,375
Ask me where he is going to
send us from this fire.

1449
02:18:36,541 --> 02:18:37,458
That's a suspense.

1450
02:18:38,583 --> 02:18:39,416
What?

1451
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,708
Brother... brother... brother...

1452
02:18:47,541 --> 02:18:50,208
You gave him a pet name when he was young.

1453
02:18:50,291 --> 02:18:51,625
What was that?

1454
02:18:51,708 --> 02:18:54,041
I forgot! I forgot! I forgot!

1455
02:18:54,250 --> 02:18:55,500
Can you remind me?

1456
02:18:55,666 --> 02:18:59,583
You gave him a name with a lot of pride!

1457
02:18:59,750 --> 02:19:01,375
What was it? Tell me.

1458
02:19:01,666 --> 02:19:03,458
Tell me, brother. Tell me, tell me...

1459
02:19:03,541 --> 02:19:04,375
Tell me!

1460
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:09,958
Hey!

1461
02:19:10,500 --> 02:19:12,666
Hey, brother! Hey, brother! Tell me!

1462
02:19:12,958 --> 02:19:14,666
-Hey...
-Hey, sit down!

1463
02:19:21,041 --> 02:19:22,625
I warned him not to touch you.

1464
02:19:23,625 --> 02:19:24,541
Didn't I?

1465
02:19:25,666 --> 02:19:27,000
You heard me, right?

1466
02:19:29,208 --> 02:19:30,750
How could he touch you!

1467
02:19:32,583 --> 02:19:34,083
No one should touch you!

1468
02:19:48,583 --> 02:19:49,791
Sorry.

1469
02:19:55,291 --> 02:19:57,125
I should be saying sorry.

1470
02:19:58,208 --> 02:19:59,500
It was all my fault.

1471
02:20:04,500 --> 02:20:06,125
No matter what happened here,

1472
02:20:06,208 --> 02:20:07,583
many times I stopped myself

1473
02:20:07,708 --> 02:20:09,833
from getting you involved in all these.

1474
02:20:11,875 --> 02:20:13,166
But I couldn't anymore.

1475
02:20:13,958 --> 02:20:18,125
I knew this is how it would end
once you come here.

1476
02:20:19,958 --> 02:20:23,000
You would have done great
anywhere but here.

1477
02:20:23,583 --> 02:20:24,833
Despite knowing that...

1478
02:20:26,958 --> 02:20:28,000
Sorry.

1479
02:20:50,708 --> 02:20:53,541
What could be more important
to dad than this?

1480
02:20:54,208 --> 02:20:57,500
He doesn't answer my calls at all.

1481
02:20:58,250 --> 02:21:00,875
Uncle, did you hear anything
about him?

1482
02:21:02,458 --> 02:21:05,125
If he doesn't turn up,
we will lose for sure.

1483
02:21:05,416 --> 02:21:07,291
There are 101 votes in total.

1484
02:21:07,541 --> 02:21:09,375
Since Naarang and Vishnu are dead,

1485
02:21:09,500 --> 02:21:12,083
they will invalidate their four votes.

1486
02:21:12,333 --> 02:21:13,833
97 votes remain.

1487
02:21:13,916 --> 02:21:18,208
With nine votes of Bhaarava,
Ranga and you, our votes would be 24.

1488
02:21:18,625 --> 02:21:22,000
We cannot trust the remaining voters.

1489
02:21:22,083 --> 02:21:24,875
Zorani, Acharya, Mishra,
Akram Pasha, Shukla...

1490
02:21:24,958 --> 02:21:26,458
I will bring all of them here.

1491
02:21:26,541 --> 02:21:29,000
You must hand over Varadha
to me after voting.

1492
02:21:29,875 --> 02:21:31,625
What are you going to do with him?

1493
02:21:37,416 --> 02:21:41,083
What is our vote count
including all of them?

1494
02:21:42,083 --> 02:21:43,750
Including the King...

1495
02:21:43,833 --> 02:21:44,833
Forty eight.

1496
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:46,750
Forty eight.

1497
02:21:53,458 --> 02:21:56,416
I will show you
what I am going to do with Varadha.

1498
02:21:56,500 --> 02:21:58,541
I will give drugs to all prisoners

1499
02:21:58,625 --> 02:22:00,208
and turn them into beasts.

1500
02:22:00,291 --> 02:22:02,458
Upon seeing red,
they would become violent.

1501
02:22:02,541 --> 02:22:04,458
Do you know what they would do then?

1502
02:22:04,541 --> 02:22:06,041
Hey, get up!

1503
02:22:15,833 --> 02:22:19,083
I will send a hundred such men
to Varadha.

1504
02:22:29,166 --> 02:22:31,416
Let's assume that the King would be back.

1505
02:22:31,541 --> 02:22:35,250
We need Varadha's vote also.

1506
02:22:41,166 --> 02:22:44,750
Right from childhood I know
that you are my father's blood.

1507
02:22:44,833 --> 02:22:47,083
I have despised you ever since.

1508
02:22:47,166 --> 02:22:49,958
If these bars were not here,

1509
02:22:50,041 --> 02:22:52,291
you would have known
how deeply I hate you.

1510
02:22:52,500 --> 02:22:55,333
King Rajamannaar won't turn up
for the voting tomorrow.

1511
02:22:55,583 --> 02:22:58,208
Everything will go as I expected.

1512
02:22:58,333 --> 02:23:01,250
Take this as an advice or a warning.

1513
02:23:01,708 --> 02:23:04,041
If you vote to lift the ceasefire

1514
02:23:04,125 --> 02:23:05,666
I will kill you!

1515
02:23:06,416 --> 02:23:11,166
A man goes to any extent
to achieve something he loves.

1516
02:23:11,416 --> 02:23:15,666
But to destroy something he hates...
he goes even beyond that.

1517
02:23:16,041 --> 02:23:20,416
I hated you even before
my younger brother did.

1518
02:23:29,208 --> 02:23:32,666
King Rajamannaar is coming
to Kotagada tomorrow.

1519
02:23:33,583 --> 02:23:38,208
If you vote for lifting the ceasefire
and disrespect him,

1520
02:23:38,291 --> 02:23:44,208
I will definitely divert all my hatred
towards the one you love the most.

1521
02:23:44,291 --> 02:23:45,375
Badri!

1522
02:23:45,750 --> 02:23:46,791
Madam!

1523
02:23:46,958 --> 02:23:49,416
If things don't go as I say tomorrow,

1524
02:23:49,500 --> 02:23:54,791
drag his brother out and behead him
once the voting is over.

1525
02:24:02,375 --> 02:24:05,416
If it's my father's blood that
runs through your veins,

1526
02:24:06,083 --> 02:24:07,916
you will make the right decision.

1527
02:24:25,708 --> 02:24:28,333
Bhaarava, I am very scared.

1528
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:30,916
Do you think today's voting
will go as we expect?

1529
02:24:33,041 --> 02:24:34,166
It has to.

1530
02:24:34,416 --> 02:24:36,250
And it will!

1531
02:24:36,875 --> 02:24:39,500
Finally, it's our time.

1532
02:24:55,875 --> 02:24:59,166
Hear... hear... hear!

1533
02:24:59,250 --> 02:25:03,375
The voting process regarding
the ceasefire declared nine days ago

1534
02:25:03,500 --> 02:25:06,291
is about to begin at Kotagada today.

1535
02:25:06,416 --> 02:25:11,291
To make a decision on this, first
the Governors, followed by the Lords,

1536
02:25:11,375 --> 02:25:15,291
and finally the King
shall use their voting right.

1537
02:25:15,500 --> 02:25:17,791
Those who want the ceasefire to end

1538
02:25:17,916 --> 02:25:20,916
shall place their bracelets
on the left plate of the scale.

1539
02:25:21,166 --> 02:25:23,291
Those who want the ceasefire to continue

1540
02:25:23,458 --> 02:25:26,916
shall place their bracelets on
the right plate of the scale.

1541
02:25:28,750 --> 02:25:30,791
As Varadha Rajamannaar is
an offender,

1542
02:25:30,875 --> 02:25:36,500
he can use his right to vote
only if there is a tie.

1543
02:25:40,375 --> 02:25:42,041
The voting shall begin now.

1544
02:25:42,166 --> 02:25:46,250
The voting should end before
the given time.

1545
02:25:46,458 --> 02:25:48,458
Governor number 1!

1546
02:25:51,791 --> 02:25:53,333
Governor number 10.

1547
02:25:53,625 --> 02:25:55,625
Governor number 41.

1548
02:25:56,083 --> 02:25:58,500
Governor number 6!

1549
02:25:58,625 --> 02:26:01,833
Governor number 26. 37.

1550
02:26:01,958 --> 02:26:03,833
Governor number 32.

1551
02:26:03,916 --> 02:26:05,166
Four!

1552
02:26:05,291 --> 02:26:07,791
Governor number 14!
5!

1553
02:26:07,916 --> 02:26:10,375
Governor number 2! 60!

1554
02:26:10,500 --> 02:26:12,500
Governor number 50! 3!

1555
02:26:12,625 --> 02:26:14,291
Governor 22!

1556
02:26:19,750 --> 02:26:21,958
I checked flight arrivals to Khansaar.

1557
02:26:22,041 --> 02:26:24,583
There is no information
about the King's arrival.

1558
02:26:25,791 --> 02:26:28,291
Now the Lords will cast their votes.

1559
02:26:43,708 --> 02:26:45,916
Only the King's fifteen votes are left.

1560
02:26:46,041 --> 02:26:49,083
If he doesn't turn up
before the time runs out,

1561
02:26:49,208 --> 02:26:51,916
the bracelets already used
for voting will be counted

1562
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:55,375
and the verdict on
ceasefire will be announced.

1563
02:27:15,416 --> 02:27:17,666
Shivmannaar's son!

1564
02:27:24,250 --> 02:27:30,250
Khansaar's King, Rajamannaar
returns to his court!

1565
02:27:51,875 --> 02:27:55,458
Since it's a tie
with 48 votes on each side,

1566
02:27:55,666 --> 02:27:59,333
the verdict shall be based
on Varadha Rajamannaar's vote.

1567
02:28:01,041 --> 02:28:04,041
Make your disgrace complete now.

1568
02:28:15,416 --> 02:28:18,500
We don't know in whose favor
the voting will end.

1569
02:28:19,541 --> 02:28:23,041
But we can decide for which side
you are going to vote.

1570
02:28:28,666 --> 02:28:30,916
It doesn't matter what they think.

1571
02:28:31,666 --> 02:28:34,958
What decision are you
going to make?

1572
02:28:35,958 --> 02:28:37,041
Tell me.

1573
02:28:39,541 --> 02:28:42,666
For a hunter, the greatest pain
is not missing a prey,

1574
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:48,875
but being not allowed to hunt.

1575
02:28:52,583 --> 02:28:54,291
Is allowing enough?

1576
02:28:59,500 --> 02:29:00,666
It's enough.

1577
02:29:03,583 --> 02:29:05,958
In that case,
declare the hunting season open!

1578
02:29:06,833 --> 02:29:10,333
I was waiting for you say it.

1579
02:29:11,291 --> 02:29:13,375
Khansaar must burn red!

1580
02:29:17,041 --> 02:29:18,958
Either with burning embers

1581
02:29:20,416 --> 02:29:24,041
or with their blood.

1582
02:29:25,916 --> 02:29:28,833
More than the redness of raging fire,

1583
02:29:29,750 --> 02:29:33,250
the crimson color of flowing blood
is always beautiful.

1584
02:30:01,833 --> 02:30:02,833
Thank you.

1585
02:30:03,875 --> 02:30:05,333
With your advice,

1586
02:30:06,166 --> 02:30:08,208
I have taken the right decision.

1587
02:30:09,166 --> 02:30:11,500
I too have...

1588
02:30:14,125 --> 02:30:16,458
the Mannaar blood
flowing through my veins.

1589
02:30:20,166 --> 02:30:23,250
Today, from 12:01 at night onwards,

1590
02:30:23,375 --> 02:30:28,125
based on the result of the votes,
the ceasefire has been lifted!

1591
02:30:39,791 --> 02:30:41,541
Now the rooster is yours.

1592
02:30:51,458 --> 02:30:53,041
They lifted the ceasefire?

1593
02:30:54,833 --> 02:30:56,458
Against them?

1594
02:30:57,750 --> 02:30:58,666
I mean how?

1595
02:31:00,208 --> 02:31:05,500
But the most important problem
was how to survive the night.

1596
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:19,583
Oh, are you saying that your people
are in trouble because of us?

1597
02:31:21,958 --> 02:31:23,416
Varadha voted in their favor.

1598
02:31:23,500 --> 02:31:25,125
All must be chopped to pieces.

1599
02:31:25,208 --> 02:31:26,250
Get everyone out.

1600
02:31:47,666 --> 02:31:49,750
Finish off his younger brother first.

1601
02:31:53,416 --> 02:31:55,041
Sharpen the knife.

1602
02:31:59,166 --> 02:32:00,083
Come.

1603
02:32:09,500 --> 02:32:12,708
Do you like to watch tigers hunting?
I do not like it at all.

1604
02:32:12,916 --> 02:32:15,250
It's very boring.
I don't like it.

1605
02:32:15,333 --> 02:32:19,833
More than tigers, I like to watch
how wild dogs hunt.

1606
02:32:20,375 --> 02:32:21,833
It skins its prey
and eats the flesh

1607
02:32:21,916 --> 02:32:23,375
while it is still alive.

1608
02:32:26,833 --> 02:32:29,541
I wanted to kill you myself.

1609
02:32:29,625 --> 02:32:31,750
But I have no capacity for such violence.

1610
02:32:31,916 --> 02:32:34,708
That's why I have raised
some wild dogs.

1611
02:32:35,250 --> 02:32:39,250
I gave them all kinds of drugs
and made them rabid.

1612
02:32:39,416 --> 02:32:45,000
When they tear up your body,
and scatter the pieces.

1613
02:32:45,083 --> 02:32:47,208
I would relish that sight!

1614
02:32:54,166 --> 02:32:56,291
Now, we have a hope to live.

1615
02:32:58,708 --> 02:32:59,833
After a long time...

1616
02:33:00,541 --> 02:33:02,333
we have started worshiping again.

1617
02:33:21,166 --> 02:33:22,166
Don't be scared.

1618
02:33:24,875 --> 02:33:26,291
Nothing will happen to them.

1619
02:33:52,791 --> 02:33:53,833
Hey.

1620
02:33:56,083 --> 02:33:58,791
You won't even cut the skin
if you whet it like that.

1621
02:34:00,375 --> 02:34:02,625
Slant it and whet.

1622
02:34:07,333 --> 02:34:09,000
It must cut through his bones!

1623
02:34:18,041 --> 02:34:20,541
You want me to give you a tattoo now?

1624
02:34:22,041 --> 02:34:25,166
Can't you see death waiting

1625
02:34:25,250 --> 02:34:29,125
all around for you, sir?

1626
02:34:31,541 --> 02:34:33,583
Do you see it too?

1627
02:34:52,125 --> 02:34:54,500
What do you want me to tattoo?

1628
02:35:00,958 --> 02:35:03,208
Whatever you see in my eyes.

1629
02:35:51,750 --> 02:35:53,541
It's done, sir.

1630
02:36:41,416 --> 02:36:43,541
Where are they all going?

1631
02:36:44,291 --> 02:36:46,583
They must have found
something redder, sir.

1632
02:36:56,291 --> 02:37:00,291
Have you ever seen
the one who hunts the hunters?

1633
02:37:03,083 --> 02:37:04,041
You can see him now.

1634
02:37:07,625 --> 02:37:10,041
Your grim reaper is here.

1635
02:37:11,833 --> 02:37:15,958
You gave them drugs and made them mad.

1636
02:37:28,875 --> 02:37:31,958
But he was born mad.

1637
02:37:46,166 --> 02:37:48,083
Release the remaining dogs!

1638
02:37:52,166 --> 02:37:53,875
Why are you so late?

1639
02:37:55,166 --> 02:37:56,791
The tattoo took some time.

1640
02:38:00,125 --> 02:38:01,750
You are tired with so few men?

1641
02:38:01,833 --> 02:38:04,000
Hey, if I had a sword

1642
02:38:04,083 --> 02:38:06,416
I too would have performed
just like you did.

1643
02:38:09,458 --> 02:38:10,958
Here, take the bigger one.

1644
02:38:31,666 --> 02:38:34,208
Why didn't you come
back here for 25 years?

1645
02:38:37,625 --> 02:38:42,416
Why didn't you call me
back here for 25 years?

1646
02:38:45,875 --> 02:38:46,750
I should have.

1647
02:39:05,166 --> 02:39:06,000
What happened?

1648
02:39:06,625 --> 02:39:07,875
Don't you know how to whistle?

1649
02:39:14,625 --> 02:39:17,083
Do you have admirers there?

1650
02:39:17,958 --> 02:39:18,791
Of course.

1651
02:39:19,875 --> 02:39:21,041
More than you.

1652
02:39:23,250 --> 02:39:26,291
But they are girlfriends.

1653
02:39:27,625 --> 02:39:29,083
I have some too.

1654
02:40:17,125 --> 02:40:19,750
But I got more applause than you.

1655
02:40:40,625 --> 02:40:44,666
The problems started when you
wanted to make Varadha a Lord.

1656
02:40:45,875 --> 02:40:47,625
We are all violent men.

1657
02:41:00,750 --> 02:41:03,000
Violence is in our blood.

1658
02:41:14,708 --> 02:41:15,791
I have been suppressing

1659
02:41:15,875 --> 02:41:17,458
that 1000-years-old violent nature

1660
02:41:17,541 --> 02:41:18,583
for the past 25 years.

1661
02:41:18,916 --> 02:41:21,000
I have a childhood story.

1662
02:41:22,291 --> 02:41:24,791
This was bound to happen some day.

1663
02:41:24,875 --> 02:41:28,458
The ceasefire was only an excuse
to fight amongst themselves.

1664
02:41:28,916 --> 02:41:32,791
I would stand on the terrace
every day looking at the entire Khansaar

1665
02:41:33,333 --> 02:41:36,875
and dream that one day
all this would be mine.

1666
02:41:38,041 --> 02:41:42,625
Enough fighting for bracelets
and breadcrumbs.

1667
02:41:44,791 --> 02:41:47,541
I want all that is

1668
02:41:49,125 --> 02:41:50,583
in front of my eyes.

1669
02:41:51,375 --> 02:41:55,875
Everyone is after my throne.

1670
02:42:11,000 --> 02:42:13,625
That is exactly why
they are joining hands.

1671
02:42:14,083 --> 02:42:15,875
The first to join hands

1672
02:42:16,083 --> 02:42:17,625
were our own people.

1673
02:42:34,666 --> 02:42:37,666
Did you think I would kill you, Uncle?

1674
02:42:38,125 --> 02:42:41,500
How can I kill my own blood?

1675
02:42:42,208 --> 02:42:44,916
If you and I stand together

1676
02:42:45,125 --> 02:42:51,375
we can bring every territory in Khansaar
under Mannaar rule.

1677
02:42:52,125 --> 02:42:53,875
What do you say, Uncle?

1678
02:42:58,208 --> 02:42:59,375
What makes you think

1679
02:42:59,458 --> 02:43:02,083
that uncle and Rudra have joined
hands against you?

1680
02:43:03,166 --> 02:43:05,666
Why do you think Rudra invited Pandit?

1681
02:43:06,625 --> 02:43:09,208
I know exactly what Pandit is capable of.

1682
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:11,500
Secondly...

1683
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:16,958
I went out of Khansaar because I
came to know about a huge weapons deal.

1684
02:43:17,041 --> 02:43:19,833
The order was placed from Khansaar.

1685
02:43:20,458 --> 02:43:21,333
Who?

1686
02:43:25,708 --> 02:43:26,750
Vaali.

1687
02:43:27,875 --> 02:43:30,625
Do you know why Rajamannaar
obliterated an entire tribe

1688
02:43:30,791 --> 02:43:33,333
but spared us, the Ghaniyaars?

1689
02:43:34,666 --> 02:43:36,416
Because we have no unity.

1690
02:43:38,416 --> 02:43:41,333
What happened to them should
never happen to us.

1691
02:43:47,958 --> 02:43:50,541
Khansaar is breaking
into pieces now.

1692
02:43:51,833 --> 02:43:53,708
If we stand united,

1693
02:43:55,625 --> 02:43:58,375
the whole of Khansaar will be ours.

1694
02:44:06,666 --> 02:44:07,625
Thiru...

1695
02:44:09,125 --> 02:44:10,375
Thirdly...

1696
02:44:12,041 --> 02:44:14,291
More terrible than these two.

1697
02:44:14,791 --> 02:44:18,958
The sin I committed 25 years ago
has come back to hunt me down.

1698
02:44:19,583 --> 02:44:20,583
Tell me.

1699
02:44:21,583 --> 02:44:22,541
Where are they?

1700
02:44:25,083 --> 02:44:26,583
Where is Bhaarava?

1701
02:44:27,958 --> 02:44:29,166
Bhaarava?

1702
02:44:31,625 --> 02:44:35,041
Your husband does not belong
to Mannaar tribe as you believe.

1703
02:44:35,666 --> 02:44:36,500
Then?

1704
02:44:39,583 --> 02:44:42,875
Do you know why I built
such huge walls around Khansaar?

1705
02:44:43,041 --> 02:44:47,041
Do you know why I hold the most powerful
weapons and maintain the biggest army?

1706
02:44:48,333 --> 02:44:52,166
Because I always have this fear
that at least one of them is still alive.

1707
02:44:52,625 --> 02:44:53,500
Who?

1708
02:44:58,583 --> 02:44:59,791
The Shouryaangas.

1709
02:45:09,916 --> 02:45:11,916
Bhaarava is a Shouryaanga?

1710
02:45:28,166 --> 02:45:30,708
Do you know how did we hid

1711
02:45:30,833 --> 02:45:33,500
our elderly, women
and children that day?

1712
02:45:53,416 --> 02:45:56,583
Wait, wait...

1713
02:45:57,291 --> 02:45:58,291
What?

1714
02:45:59,666 --> 02:46:01,125
Shouryaanga army was waiting

1715
02:46:01,208 --> 02:46:02,666
for the past 25 years,

1716
02:46:02,750 --> 02:46:04,958
all the while, causing internal conflicts

1717
02:46:05,041 --> 02:46:06,458
in Khansaar to weaken it.

1718
02:46:09,875 --> 02:46:12,833
We still feel the pain.

1719
02:46:16,791 --> 02:46:21,750
We have been living in hiding.

1720
02:46:21,958 --> 02:46:24,083
We have changed our names.

1721
02:46:24,333 --> 02:46:27,416
We have changed our identity.

1722
02:46:27,833 --> 02:46:30,125
All for this day.

1723
02:46:32,125 --> 02:46:33,583
When will you forgive him?

1724
02:46:33,666 --> 02:46:35,541
-Who?
-Your son.

1725
02:46:35,708 --> 02:46:38,458
If you don't eliminate
your enemies by tonight

1726
02:46:38,541 --> 02:46:39,458
The Constitution.

1727
02:46:39,625 --> 02:46:43,458
Naarang must defy Rajamannaar.
He must kill Varadha.

1728
02:46:46,166 --> 02:46:51,333
You beheaded our deity!

1729
02:46:55,416 --> 02:46:59,458
To burn you alive
along with your throne...

1730
02:46:59,583 --> 02:47:03,833
each one of the Shouryaangas
are eagerly waiting here.

1731
02:47:10,791 --> 02:47:12,875
Except one.

1732
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:20,916
You...

1733
02:47:22,541 --> 02:47:25,208
remember Dhaara?

1734
02:47:31,625 --> 02:47:33,458
Our leader.

1735
02:47:36,041 --> 02:47:37,708
But you killed him.

1736
02:47:40,458 --> 02:47:41,583
But...

1737
02:47:44,041 --> 02:47:47,583
His son is still alive!

1738
02:47:51,416 --> 02:47:56,500
That night, your son Varadha rescued
Dhaara's son

1739
02:47:56,666 --> 02:47:58,208
and sent him out of Khansaar.

1740
02:47:58,291 --> 02:48:00,291
Leave immediately from here.

1741
02:48:00,500 --> 02:48:03,125
Did you just threw away your bracelet?

1742
02:48:03,291 --> 02:48:04,833
Why did you do that?

1743
02:48:06,208 --> 02:48:11,250
We have been looking
for him all these years.

1744
02:48:13,041 --> 02:48:16,000
But he has returned by himself.

1745
02:48:17,500 --> 02:48:19,333
Varadha has got
his army registered at the gate.

1746
02:48:21,416 --> 02:48:28,291
You all saw what he did
right after he set foot in Khansaar.

1747
02:48:30,083 --> 02:48:31,583
Vishnu was killed.

1748
02:48:31,833 --> 02:48:32,833
Was it him?

1749
02:48:35,791 --> 02:48:38,083
Our leader!

1750
02:48:56,041 --> 02:48:58,250
I will get our army ready, Father.

1751
02:48:59,708 --> 02:49:00,666
He is a...

1752
02:49:01,041 --> 02:49:01,916
Shouryaanga?

1753
02:49:02,166 --> 02:49:04,125
Wait, wait... wait...

1754
02:49:05,416 --> 02:49:07,666
I need a drink.
Do you have?

1755
02:49:14,500 --> 02:49:16,916
Inform our Mannaar army
to stay on high alert

1756
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:19,791
not just at the Khansaar gates,
but throughout the city!

1757
02:49:25,083 --> 02:49:25,916
Whoa!

1758
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:39,583
On one hand, all of Khansaar
is ready to go to war for the throne.

1759
02:49:47,500 --> 02:49:50,250
On the other, thousands of Shouryaangas
are ready

1760
02:49:50,333 --> 02:49:52,125
to burn the chair down.

1761
02:49:54,875 --> 02:49:58,625
But Deva had promised
the same throne to Varadha.

1762
02:50:03,583 --> 02:50:04,708
But...

1763
02:50:05,291 --> 02:50:08,916
The right to sit on that throne
belongs to...

1764
02:50:20,458 --> 02:50:21,541
Deva.

1765
02:50:32,083 --> 02:50:33,291
Does Deva know about this?

1766
02:50:43,458 --> 02:50:44,375
What if he finds out?

1767
02:50:50,291 --> 02:50:53,250
No one should survive.

1768
02:51:06,625 --> 02:51:10,208
You asked me about the name
I gave him as a child...

1769
02:51:20,125 --> 02:51:22,000
Salaar.
