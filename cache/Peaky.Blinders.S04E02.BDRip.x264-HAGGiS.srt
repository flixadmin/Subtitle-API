1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:02,833
You can't live like this another year.

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:06,914
Tommy, you've never even seen Arthur's
kid. NorJohn and Esme's.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,912
<i>- I'm staying with Polly.
- She's in a bad way.</i>

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,070
I'll get through to her.

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,880
<i>The union convenor causing all
the trouble. Her name 'sJessie Eden.</i>

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,077
I will conduct myself as a businessman.

7
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,560
Who says sweetheart.

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,395
Today, everyone in the family
received one of these.

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,756
<i>Changretta knows where we all
live. We need to be together in a place</i>

10
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,479
<i>even they won't dare to come.</i>

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,960
<i>You mean back home?</i>

12
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,997
<i>This is the New York Mafia
we 're talking about!</i>

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,753
<i>And we 're the Peaky Blinders!</i>

14
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,275
<i>We're not the Peaky Blinders
unless we 're together.</i>

15
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,352
- What's the purpose of your visit?
- Pleasure.

16
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,237
<i># I began to warm and chill</i>

17
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,318
<i># To objects and their fields</i>

18
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,958
<i># A ragged cup, a twisted mop</i>

19
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,520
<i># The face ofJesus in my soup</i>

20
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,510
<i># Those sinister dinner deals</i>

21
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,591
<i># The meal trolley's wicked wheels</i>

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,516
<i># And the mercy seat is waiting</i>

23
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,550
<i># And I think my head is burning</i>

24
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,791
<i># And in a way I'm yearning</i>

25
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,000
<i># To be done with all this
Weighing of the truth</i>

26
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,910
<i># An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth</i>

27
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,631
<i># And anyway I told the truth</i>

28
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,271
<i># And I'm not afraid to die</i>

29
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,950
<i># And the mercy seat is burning</i>

30
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,670
<i># And I think my head is glowing</i>

31
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,036
<i># And in a way I'm hoping</i>

32
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:11,951
<i># To be done with all this
Weighing of the truth</i>

33
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,149
<i># An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth</i>

34
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,831
<i># And anyway I told the truth</i>

35
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,275
<i># And I'm afraid I told a lie #</i>

36
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,192
Please,
can we get some help here? Please!

37
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,477
It's all right Michael.
It's all right Michael, I'm here.

38
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,711
It's all right Michael,
you're gonna be OK.

39
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,360
Don't leave us now,
just keep keep breathing.

40
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:46,351
No, no, I don't want fucking
kids in here, I want soldiers.

41
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,875
I don't want fucking kids
who joined just for the sport.

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,956
Go on, go.

43
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,713
I want men who've served in here.

44
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,479
All right, Poll.

45
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,040
Mrs Gray, please.

46
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,952
Don't go, don't go...

47
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,995
He's in good hands.

48
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,470
Polly? Poll? Poll?

49
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,514
Fuck those bastards responsible!

50
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,034
All right,
let them do their job, all right?

51
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,077
Let them do their job,
I'll get soldiers.

52
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,152
I'll be back. I'll be back.

53
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,355
Is it him?

54
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,959
Yeah.

55
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,558
On his own doorstep.

56
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,236
His own fucking doorstep.

57
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,674
Right, get out. And you, out.

58
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,680
What the fuck?

59
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,629
PoorJohn.

60
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,279
Fucking gone.

61
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,599
In the bleak midwinter.

62
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,560
We promised, Arthur.

63
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,040
I can't.

64
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,113
In the hole we promised.

65
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,510
- Can't look at him.
- Come here brother.

66
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,200
Come here. Come on, come here.

67
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,793
Oh, my!

68
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,320
Now say it.

69
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,994
Say it, brother.

70
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,871
In the bleak midwinter.

71
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,112
You're cursed
and I curse you again!

72
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,636
Come here, come here.

73
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,953
Leave me with him.

74
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,150
You've spoken to him, now it's my turn.

75
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,790
Arthur?

76
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,953
No peace for either of you, ever.

77
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,037
Our stuff will stay with me.

78
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,598
Taking the children on the road...

79
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,517
to live with decent people.

80
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,596
They'll never know
the curse side of this family.

81
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,953
We're done with them, John.

82
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,759
Tommy, they're gathered.

83
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,875
John is dead.

84
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,316
Esme's gone on the road with the Lees.

85
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,993
She's taken the kids.

86
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:27,554
Michael is badly wounded,
they say it's 60/40 in his favour.

87
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,314
There's no number,
there's no percentages.

88
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,876
So the hand, the hand
beneath him stops him falling.

89
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,679
Spoke to someone...

90
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,069
my son will live.

91
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,035
Michael and John were shot
because we killed someone...

92
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,594
Vincenzo Changretta.

93
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,071
His son Luca
has come to take revenge.

94
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,960
Men from New York
and Sicily are in Birmingham.

95
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,912
These men will not leave our city
until the whole family is dead.

96
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,551
That's how it works, an eye for an eye.

97
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,515
- It's called vendetta.
- Yeah, well...

98
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,519
The bullet's been written...

99
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,039
It says Luca.

100
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,154
When the time comes...

101
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,394
and it will come...

102
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,998
me as the oldest brother...

103
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,760
will put this bullet
into his fucking head.

104
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,679
There's been some bad blood between us.

105
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,120
Polly, please?

106
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,591
Until this business is settled
we stay together.

107
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,840
We stay here...

108
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,271
Small Heath, Bordesley,
Hay Mills down to Greet.

109
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,357
We know every face,

110
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,272
every man is a soldier in this army.

111
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,276
These men are professionals
and they're good at what they do,

112
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,960
so we're gonna need more than we have.

113
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,316
We send a message to Aberama Gold.

114
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,840
No. No, Tom.

115
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,791
I'll get you 50 Lee boys. Good men, Tom.

116
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,951
I don't need good men Johnny,
for this I need bad men.

117
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,509
Tommy, his people
are fucking savages.

118
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,478
You know, heathens, Tom.

119
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,472
They don't even let them in the fair,

120
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,917
so they come and steal our horses.
You know, stealing from their own, Tom.

121
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,835
So this is the plan, Thomas?

122
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,594
This is the plan?

123
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,872
Bullet with a name on it,
help from a bunch of savages.

124
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,593
We're gonna go on the offensive.

125
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,914
- I've spoken to Moss.
- Moss?

126
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,520
I've spoken to Moss.

127
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:57,040
Moss is putting out word.
Eyes and ears so we can find them.

128
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,274
Yeah, the truth is, the police
are busy with the revolution.

129
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,276
Moss says they're
expecting strikes and riots

130
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,119
when the weather gets warm
and the Bolsheviks plan to...

131
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,157
The Bolsheviks
couldn't plan a fucking picnic.

132
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,033
- He's reading the wrong papers.
- Ada!

133
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:16,553
Real, or not real, the coppers
don't give a fuck about us, all right?

134
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,433
Which means...

135
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,358
that here today in this room...

136
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,070
we have to agree to
end this war between us.

137
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,596
Take a vote.

138
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,989
Peace.

139
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,631
I was never a part of this, but...

140
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,949
peace.

141
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,954
Peace.

142
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,639
Peace.

143
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,920
Peace.

144
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,639
Shut up, Finn.

145
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,790
Why can't I say peace?

146
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,636
Arthur, let him have his say.

147
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,635
Finn? Sit at the table.

148
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,470
Little bastard...

149
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,077
Sending a fucking kid,
Sergeant Major...

150
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,589
to do men's work.

151
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,436
My son's not here to speak...

152
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,710
So I'll speak on behalf of us both.

153
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,960
Truce.

154
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,920
Five for peace.

155
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,438
Two for truce, one abstension.

156
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,470
Let's get on with the war.

157
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,038
Whoa. Curly, how are ya?

158
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,077
Here, catch.

159
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,634
Right, come on then,
boys, unload, unload.

160
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,752
Hat.

161
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,234
Blues and Villa goalkeeper?

162
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,356
Dan Tremelling
plays in goal for the Blues

163
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,999
and TommyJackson for the Villa.

164
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,390
Fair enough.

165
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,353
- Charlie?
- What is it, Curly?

166
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,034
We've run out of bullets Charlie.

167
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,034
We need more ammunition.

168
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,074
More ammunition.

169
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,392
Johnny, more ammo.

170
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,397
We're like sitting ducks
here if the wops come.

171
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,674
Yeah, well, Tommy said
we should do it in the open.

172
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,038
This is howJohn wanted to go.

173
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,675
On the smoke.

174
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,760
And the truth is...

175
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,117
we died together once before.

176
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,390
Arthur,

177
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,390
me,

178
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,075
Danny Whizzbang,

179
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,589
Freddie Thorne,

180
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,670
Jeremiah,

181
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,635
and John.

182
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,433
We were cut off from the retreat...

183
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,396
No bullets left, waiting for
the Prussian cavalry

184
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,233
to come and to finish us off.

185
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,279
And while we waited...

186
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:33,115
Jeremiah said, "We should sing,
'In the Bleak Midwinter.'"

187
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,360
But we were spared.

188
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,920
The enemy never came.

189
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,080
And we all agreed...

190
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,119
that everything after that was extra.

191
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,274
And when our time came...

192
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,429
we'd all remember.

193
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,557
You remember that God spared you.

194
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,720
But what did you do with that
extra time that he gave you, eh, Thomas?

195
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,950
At ease! At ease.

196
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,912
Do not return fire.

197
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,552
I repeat, do not return fire.
Stand down.

198
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,954
The men doing the firing
are on our side.

199
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,160
I took the trouble...

200
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:08,630
of giving an invitation
to Aberama Gold.

201
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,280
Oh fuck! Now it's begun.

202
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,876
Put it out in the open on purpose.

203
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,434
You used John's funeral fire
as a fucking beacon.

204
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,880
We were never
in any danger Polly.

205
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,030
You set a trap.

206
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,553
Finn? Finn? Go to
the yard and light the fires.

207
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,434
You set a trap with us as fucking bait.

208
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,590
Who's dead?

209
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,354
Our enemies.

210
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,432
- Who's dead?
- You wanna know, Poll?

211
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,555
Two fucking no good Italians
heard about the vendetta,

212
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,115
tried to make a fucking name
for themselves, that's who.

213
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,079
We got word to them about the funeral,

214
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,435
the where, the when...

215
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,037
Told them where to
stand for the best shot.

216
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,756
And Aberama Gold
would do the rest.

217
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,393
That's the language of vendetta,

218
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,439
they take one of ours,
we take two of theirs.

219
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:15,157
You used your own brother's funeral.

220
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,315
When did we vote on this, Tommy?

221
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,074
Curly, get a boat ready
to take the bodies to the city.

222
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,675
And another boat for anyone,

223
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,400
anyone who wants no more part of this.

224
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,113
'Cause this is how it's gonna be.

225
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,313
Polly?

226
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,191
I'm not staying for
this, Arthur, I'm going home.

227
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,872
Oh, yeah? Home's 57, Watery Lane.

228
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:53,197
You go there, lock
the doors, you wait for me.

229
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,316
Key to number 57.

230
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,550
I'm going home to the country.

231
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,439
You will stay here until it's over.
Take the fucking key, Linda.

232
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,435
Look, away from here
you are a weakness to all of us.

233
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,160
They will take you hostage and the baby,

234
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,038
they will use the baby.

235
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:25,036
Take it. Put the kettle on,
wait for your husband.

236
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,716
The only way any of you
Shelbys will leave this place

237
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,911
is on a cloud of smoke like John.

238
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,671
Well, you're a Shelby now too, Linda.

239
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,118
Five hundred each.
A thousand for the brace.

240
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,400
Where do you want them?

241
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,551
Charlie, take him to the yard.

242
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,998
Not too far
and not too deep, Curly,

243
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,514
I need the message to get through.

244
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,920
Okay, Tommy.

245
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,835
Finn, you go with him.

246
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,551
Go on. Go with him.

247
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:39,273
Oh, Tom, uh, tellJanet to
save me some goose, please.

248
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,631
On your feet.

249
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,240
Wait outside.

250
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,040
Hello, Mum.

251
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,032
They said you'd be out cold.

252
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,797
No, don't move.

253
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,557
The doctor said they've
sewn you up like a football.

254
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,315
What else did he say?

255
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,440
He said you took four bullets.

256
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:54,151
Only one was live, one was ricochet...

257
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,234
Two were already spent.

258
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,478
Two had passed through John.

259
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,154
Last thing I remember
was his face.

260
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,359
I watched him go.

261
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,757
Where's Tommy?

262
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,911
Oh, don't worry about Tommy,
just get better.

263
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,480
Where is he?

264
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,517
Tommy's back.

265
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,753
We're all back. Garrison,
Watery Lane, Charlie's...

266
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,271
- I need a cigarette.
- No.

267
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,831
I made a decision.

268
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,593
Give me a cigarette, Mum.

269
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,320
- It's not allowed.
- It's not allowed?

270
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,359
- I've decided we're gonna get away.
- Mm, yeah?

271
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,074
Just me and you, Australia.

272
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,435
I've been to the Cunard office
and I've got a magazine.

273
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,469
- Hmm.
- Now, America's no good

274
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:21,200
because that's where they are,
but there's no Italians in Australia.

275
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,953
I think there are, Mum.

276
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,240
Bad ones, I mean.

277
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,799
Have you stopped taking
those prison tablets?

278
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,280
Don't you worry about me.

279
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,589
Well, I do.

280
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,918
And just you get better.

281
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,912
The doctor says it'll be five weeks,
then you'll be up and walking.

282
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,957
Now, there's a boat that
leaves on February the 13th.

283
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,872
Tell Tommy I need to see him.

284
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,514
Tell him to bring a gun small enough
to fit in the chamber pot, in case...

285
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,831
I've banned Tommy from coming.

286
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,074
The factory's coming
back to work tomorrow.

287
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,560
Just forget about the fucking factories.

288
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,199
Is there any word of
them going out on strike?

289
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,509
We can go to Australia,

290
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,876
it'll just be you, me, and your sister,

291
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,993
'cause I've found out where she was
buried, somewhere outside Melbourne.

292
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,349
Listen, Mum...

293
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,272
I'm gonna get better slowly.

294
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,198
But you need to get better fast.

295
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,600
Without you he falls apart
and without him...

296
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,432
without him, they'll take us all.

297
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,317
You've got to get us through this.

298
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,754
And I promise...

299
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,274
I'll board that train with
you and we'll go to Australia.

300
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,594
I like your yard, Mr Strong.
How much would you take for it?

301
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,314
It's not for sale.

302
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,995
Not for sale?

303
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,035
Okay.

304
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:38,160
I just took a look around.
I like this place.

305
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:43,351
Fire for melting silver,
canal to get it away.

306
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,556
How much?

307
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,597
Nothing you see here
is for sale, Mr Gold.

308
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,280
Oh, everything's for sale, everything.

309
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:03,430
You tell Mr Strong
I'm going to buy his yard.

310
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,351
This yard has been in
his family since they settled.

311
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,836
But I've decided to
make it part of our deal.

312
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,795
Charlie?

313
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,640
Charlie, come here.

314
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,718
I'm gonna spin a coin
for your yard, Charlie.

315
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,075
You're going to what?

316
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,954
If it's heads...

317
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,992
Abbie here takes all
of this with my blessing.

318
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,676
Tommy?

319
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,400
And if it's tails...

320
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,838
I fuck your daughter, Mr Gold.

321
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,399
You have three daughters I hear,

322
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,556
and Esmeralda is the oldest
and also the prettiest,

323
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,353
so I'll have her.

324
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,319
So make her part of the deal
and spin against the yard.

325
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,872
Tommy, for fuck's sake.

326
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,711
Here, you toss the coin, Mr Gold.

327
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,875
No.

328
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,031
Please don't believe this is a joke,

329
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:30,039
the coin to us is sacred, yes, Arthur?

330
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,395
Sacred.

331
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,438
You toss that coin, you take
a bet before witnesses,

332
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,194
and if I win...

333
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,640
Then we'll insist

334
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:49,636
that the terms of this agreement...
wager are fulfilled.

335
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,355
Toss the coin, Mr Gold.

336
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,237
Tommy Shelby, OBE...

337
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,233
No wager today...

338
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:26,597
but with this penny I will buy
a flower to put on your grave...

339
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,880
When the time comes.

340
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,040
And before that time...

341
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:41,276
please don't again disrespect
my friends or their valued property.

342
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,195
We missed Christmas, let's have it now.

343
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,151
Peace on earth, goodwill to all men.

344
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,875
Drink?

345
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,919
Rum, Curly?

346
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:05,797
Toast to my brother, John,
raise your glasses all of you.

347
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,839
Raise them up, all of you.

348
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,749
John Shelby.

349
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:15,112
I've got wire, I've got chains,
I've got the steel rods. Now what?

350
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,755
Right, put the steel rods
up the geese's arse there,

351
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,076
and then you put those
steel rods above the fire,

352
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,356
spinning the rod to stop
the bird from burning.

353
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,399
Cheers!

354
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,120
You did get potatoes, Charlie?

355
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,396
No, I didn't get fucking potatoes,
what's the matter with you?

356
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,519
I don't want that bastard Aberama Gold

357
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,956
putting it around that we live
like Diddycoys.

358
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:38,353
I want him to see that we live proper,
that we eat proper, in the proper way.

359
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,477
What the fuck are you talking about?

360
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,472
I'll get the potatoes meself.

361
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,320
Never thought my high
fucking heels from Paris

362
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:56,235
would be stepping through the horse shit
of Small Heath ever again.

363
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,999
Temporary, Polly.

364
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,390
Yeah, until hell freezes over.

365
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,753
How's Michael?

366
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:46,075
You said eight men from New York,
seven from Sicily, at £500 each?

367
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,633
Course you can afford it.

368
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,600
Most we'll do ourselves.

369
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,156
How many of your factories
are in the safe territories?

370
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,435
Seventy percent.

371
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:59,034
Shelby Company Limited
will continue to manufacture.

372
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,790
Lizzie says its only whores these days?

373
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,116
Yeah.

374
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,512
Have them smuggled in, I suppose.

375
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,394
I need you back, Polly.

376
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,557
Paying whores for sex.

377
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,233
Paying killers to kill.

378
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,515
Yep, nothing for nothing.

379
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,960
Poor Thomas.

380
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,880
You know, our mother went this way.

381
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,199
Spirits and ghosts, tablets,
fucking... fucking séances,

382
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,237
scaring us kids
halfway to fuckin' death.

383
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:36,279
Yeah, well. I'm not going that way.

384
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,436
'Cause in the smoke
I realised something.

385
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,954
I'm just like you now.

386
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,354
You and Arthur.

387
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:53,520
I was dead in that noose
and then I was saved,

388
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,597
so everything from now on is extra.

389
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,476
But what I didn't understand until today

390
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,312
is when you're dead already...

391
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,000
you're free.

392
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,879
Fucking love it.

393
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,635
I'll help you because
Michael wants me to help you.

394
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,280
Starting now...

395
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:25,718
Get your whores vetted by Lizzie,
they'll use your weakness.

396
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,559
Don't take any new men on
in the factories

397
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,632
unless you know their families.

398
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:37,310
And your new friend,
Mr Aberama Gold...

399
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,199
he wants something
other than just money.

400
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:45,675
I see things in the air around people,
but it's not just the tablets.

401
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,554
It's real.

402
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,996
Ask him what he really wants.

403
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,156
She's a fine beast this one.

404
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,910
Nothing you see is for sale, Mr Shelby.

405
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:48,155
You know your grandfather
camped with mine for a while?

406
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,149
Yep...

407
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,876
And didn't last.

408
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:56,113
No, it ended badly
in a pub called the Wenlock.

409
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,755
We were owed money, still are.

410
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:12,397
Other than money, and this
scrapyard that's clearly not for sale,

411
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,039
what is it that you
want from me, Mr Gold?

412
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,072
How do you know
I want anything from you?

413
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,400
Well, because my company treasurer

414
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:29,156
is a certified accountant
and also apparently, a witch.

415
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,353
You're a sporting man.

416
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,035
- Yes, I am.
- And a gambling man.

417
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,911
Bonnie, take off your shirt.

418
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,918
What I want from you, Mr Shelby,
is for you to take a gamble on him.

419
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:56,233
I want you to help
my son achieve his ambition.

420
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,831
What ambition might that be?

421
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,630
Who is it?

422
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,031
Inspector Moss.

423
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,480
- I'm looking for Tommy.
- He's at Charlie's.

424
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,874
But I wouldn't go there,
some bad men have arrived.

425
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,715
Yes, I've heard.

426
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,958
They'll be drunk by now, or worse.

427
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,474
Can you take a message?

428
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,756
The, uh, intelligence service in London

429
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,150
have sent seven officers up
to Birmingham

430
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:24,757
to check out the investigation
into communists and seditionists.

431
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:28,038
They've got a list of people
of great interest and, uh,

432
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:31,636
top of that list is
Ada Thorne, formerly Shelby.

433
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:35,191
Now, they seem to think that
she came back from New York

434
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,840
to organise a revolution in Birmingham.

435
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,480
Well, tell them they're wrong.

436
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,754
Ada Shelby's now firmly back
in place in the family business.

437
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,753
Thing is, when you get
a mark against your name...

438
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,596
it's very hard to shift it.

439
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,914
They will come looking for her.

440
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,630
Well, tell them there's a queue.
Everybody wants a Shelby.

441
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,314
Mrs Shelby...

442
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:03,191
These are military men,
no less dangerous than any Italians.

443
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,676
You tell Tommy,
I think he'll understand.

444
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,319
Say goodnight to you then.

445
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,915
- Hello, Curly.
- Oh, hello.

446
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,437
I'm here to collect Mr Shelby's
horse. I'm a little early, I think.

447
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:56,553
Are you going
to train the horse to race?

448
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,750
Yes.

449
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,471
Don't use a crop, she's very gentle.

450
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,039
- I won't.
- Yo.

451
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,349
I, I...

452
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,872
How is Mr Shelby?

453
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:13,831
Well, now he's got the Americans
after him, he's a bit hard on people.

454
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,550
- The Americans?
- Yeah, they call them the Mafia.

455
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,950
Dear God.

456
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:22,198
Yeah, there's 15 of them.
Yeah, they want to kill us all,

457
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,476
but we got guns and grenades
and, and Polly's back,

458
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,472
so it's gonna be okay, yeah.

459
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,754
I'll get the horse.

460
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,070
Mr Shelby, thank God you're back,
we've got real trouble.

461
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,920
What meetings do I have today?

462
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,471
Um, well, uh, there's a supplier
from Coventry at 10:00,

463
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,836
uh, the convener with
the boiler makers unit at 11:00,

464
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,440
and then Chamber of Commerce at 1:00.

465
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,630
But that isn't the thing...

466
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,030
Right. Clear a space here,
move this car back,

467
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,311
give me a hundred feet of rope
and a bell.

468
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,232
- Rope?
- Yep, and a bell.

469
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,837
Mr Shelby, this place
is about to explode.

470
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,593
A rope and a bell, Devlin.

471
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,074
Bonnie, this way.

472
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,515
Yes, Mr Shelby.

473
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:21,270
And by the way, the revolution
is scheduled to begin at noon.

474
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,160
There he is, Billy Mills,

475
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,232
former heavyweight champion,

476
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,277
Staffordshire, Warwickshire
and Worcestershire.

477
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,436
Hello, Billy.

478
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,637
Yeah.

479
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,510
And now I work for you, Mr Shelby,

480
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,233
for not enough money.

481
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,394
Right. That enough for you?

482
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,435
Enough for what?

483
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:48,196
Someone here who wants to fight you.
Bonnie Gold, come here, son.

484
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,313
I'm a heavyweight,

485
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,954
he's a welterweight at best.

486
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,958
Nevertheless, he wants to fight you.

487
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,509
Yeah. And then when I damage him,
the Blinders will take my eyes.

488
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:04,551
No comeback, Billy,
just a fight, Queensbury Rules.

489
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,358
- When?
- Now.

490
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,760
- Where?
- Here!

491
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,435
Right, you lot, come here.

492
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:15,070
Let's make it interesting.
Come place a wager with me.

493
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,799
I'll give you good odds.

494
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,510
I'll give you good odds on the boy,
even better on the big lad.

495
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,632
There you go, what you want?

496
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,392
Bonnie, come here, son.

497
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,600
- Give him one!
- Let's have it then!

498
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:13,195
Your boy knows he can hit back, right?

499
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,435
Told him in the professional game
people want their money's worth,

500
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,000
don't win too fast.

501
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,760
But if you've seen enough...

502
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,119
Finish it, Bonnie.

503
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,553
Fuck me. That was a punch.

504
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,232
What's he got, horseshoes
in those gloves or what?

505
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,837
No, just his dad's strength
and his mother's temper.

506
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:51,310
- Does he have fits?
- No.

507
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,079
- Asthma?
- No.

508
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,355
How's he cut?

509
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,636
Well, no one's cut him
yet, but his skin's thick.

510
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:59,833
- Does he drink?
- Water, sometimes.

511
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,151
- How many fights?
- Twenty-five, bare knuckle,

512
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:05,551
all knockouts, five with gloves
in pastures, all knockouts.

513
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,552
Against Romany fighters?

514
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,632
That's why they won't let us in the
fairs no more, he keeps winning.

515
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:12,110
I could fight a fucking tree
and knock it out, Mr Shelby.

516
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,556
I like him. I like it.

517
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:18,230
- Mrs Eden is waiting upstairs
- I'll be there in a minute. Arthur?

518
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,400
Mr Shelby's on his way.

519
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,960
Fight in the workshop?

520
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:39,914
No, no, just a bit of sport.

521
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:40,990
Do you want some more tea?

522
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,554
No, what kind of sport?

523
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,710
Sport between men, Mrs Eden.

524
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,713
Actually, I'm Miss Eden.

525
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:54,274
Be patient, a good man will come.

526
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,193
- What do you think?
- No, that was over fast.

527
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:59,999
Yeah, but you can tell, eh?

528
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:02,549
I'd give him to the Irish boys
at Digbeth, they can teach him.

529
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,394
- And then what?
- We promote him.

530
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,559
Big money in London,
New York, if he's good.

531
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,114
We control him.

532
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:13,034
On the book, control the odds,
like a horse.

533
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:17,279
Control when he wins, when he loses.
Alfie Solomon runs a fighter,

534
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:21,036
says it's fuckin' money for nothing,
fighting's been good for us,

535
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,634
better if you know who's gonna win.

536
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,676
But we got a lot going on, that's all.

537
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,111
Yeah. That's why it'd be good
to have the kid around.

538
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:32,600
We take the fucking kid on,

539
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,880
one day he may end up
fucking taking a bullet for you.

540
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:38,397
Can't afford to lose
another brother, can I?

541
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,677
No one else is like him,
so he's all right.

542
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,555
Come on.

543
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:51,393
All right, I'll do it.

544
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:54,270
But we need to
do a deal about money.

545
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:56,795
- Hmm.
- Yeah. Speak to my accountant.

546
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,274
- The witch?
- Yeah.

547
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:00,829
So when will my first real
fight be do you think, Mr Shelby?

548
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,192
Soon as we can find anyone stupid
enough to get in the ring with you.

549
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:06,589
God help him.

550
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,114
There you go, Bonnie.

551
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,639
You're a Peaky Blinder now, son.

552
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:27,511
- There you go, the lion's share.
- Thank you.

553
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:44,234
Mr Shelby...
I understand you've had a bereavement.

554
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,232
I'm here to talk business.

555
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,840
Then I'll be blunt.

556
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:52,790
As will I.

557
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,673
What you're doing here is robbery.

558
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:56,240
Every man is free to leave.

559
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:59,711
You cut five shillings
from the weekly wage.

560
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,834
And you said, if I did that

561
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:08,237
you'd bring every man and woman
in all my factories out on strike.

562
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:10,115
Yes.

563
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,796
Do you have a whistle?

564
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,436
If so, blow it.

565
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,390
I thought at least
we might have a discussion,

566
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:28,999
as I do with other owners.

567
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,353
I'm not other owners.

568
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:32,956
No.

569
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:37,956
You believe because coal is expensive
and it's been a cold winter

570
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:40,236
and because wages have been
cut over the past twelve months,

571
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:44,997
you think because of all that
nobody will walk out on strike,

572
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:47,639
because no one can afford to.

573
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,476
And until recently
that would've been true.

574
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,031
But something has changed
this past year.

575
00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:01,800
Cold winter in the east,
people are not afraid anymore.

576
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,477
I have it on very good authority

577
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:09,519
that the Bolsheviks couldn't
organise a fucking picnic.

578
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:14,639
You know, Mr Shelby...

579
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,356
It's almost as if you want trouble.

580
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:28,029
If the rule of law
in Birmingham were to break down

581
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:32,672
during this period
of turmoil for my family,

582
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:36,470
then yes, that would
indeed have its benefits

583
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:40,279
for reasons you could not understand.

584
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:41,714
I've heard rumours.

585
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:44,513
Sport between men.

586
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:47,480
Just blow your fucking whistle, eh?

587
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,751
Tools down, we've had a clearing!

588
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:16,515
Right, come on you lot,
put your tools down!

589
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:30,879
Everyone out!

590
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,193
I said, everyone out.

591
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:38,752
Stop working immediately.

592
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,436
Yeah, come in.

593
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:04,794
I did say this would happen.

594
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:08,594
Who's next?

595
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:14,358
Um, he's a, a delegate from
the European Council for Trade.

596
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:18,633
He's here to talk about
the import of car parts to France.

597
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:21,195
- Right.
- He's come all the way from Paris,

598
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:25,437
but given the circumstances
I could send him away?

599
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,996
Given what circumstances? Send him in.

600
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:56,272
Mr Shelby, this is
Monsieur Paz from Paris.

601
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:04,519
I heard you had trouble.

602
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,040
It's good of you to see me.

603
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:12,079
You just came from Paris, eh?

604
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,280
You know Paris?

605
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,757
I left Paris in a cattle truck.

606
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:28,953
They said you were French.

607
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:33,720
Well, I came here from Paris.

608
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,032
That does not mean I'm French.

609
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:44,839
Guess where I'm from.

610
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,834
Well, in my cattle truck in Paris...

611
00:50:55,240 --> 00:51:00,474
There were American
soldiers who played cards.

612
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:07,954
They sound like you.

613
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:11,872
Yeah. Did you win?

614
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:17,830
You didn't come on a train. Your suit
is pressed, your shoes are clean.

615
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:21,070
Where do you get your suits made?

616
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:25,635
I have a tailor in New York City.

617
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:28,596
Look.

618
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:35,357
Funacci, Italian.

619
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,039
He's my uncle.

620
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:40,510
He makes suits in
the basement of Madge Street.

621
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:43,674
He is my uncle,

622
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:47,713
so every stitch, stitched with blood.

623
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:52,951
I heard you dress well, Mr Shelby,

624
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,360
but now I see...

625
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:00,639
not so well as me.

626
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:09,632
You know, I have uncles as well...

627
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:18,191
But they're not the sort of men who
would, who would work in a basement

628
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,639
with a needle and thread,

629
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:23,029
Mr Changretta.

630
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:34,680
I am surprised how easy it was
to get into a room with you.

631
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,710
And now?

632
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:44,151
And now?

633
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:49,352
And now you should know

634
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:54,473
that during the trouble you
had earlier on your factory floor

635
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:58,833
I sent an accomplice
into your office in overalls.

636
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:03,480
He found your gun...

637
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:07,514
and unloaded it.

638
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:16,560
Arthur Shelby.

639
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:19,997
Polly Gray.

640
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:25,320
Michael Gray.

641
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:29,914
John Shelby.

642
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:39,314
Spent.

643
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:43,032
Ada Thorne.

644
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,432
And finally...

645
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,479
Tommy Shelby.

646
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:00,998
None of you will survive.

647
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:06,880
You're level of security is pitiful

648
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:14,230
and we are an organisation
of a different dimension.

649
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:20,514
I could've killed you when
I walked through the door.

650
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,274
But you see...

651
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,512
I want you to be the last.

652
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:34,793
I want you to be alive after
your entire family is dead

653
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:37,996
'cause my mother says

654
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:41,349
that is what will hurt you the most.

655
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:49,397
You people have
traditions of honour, as do we.

656
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:58,520
Instead of sending you a black hand,
I could've had you killed in the night.

657
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:00,993
I don't know why...

658
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:10,109
But I want you to know why

659
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:19,399
and I wanna suggest to you that
we fight this vendetta with honour.

660
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:33,473
No civilians, no children.

661
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:37,033
No police.

662
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:42,273
Welcome to Birmingham, Mr Changretta.

663
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:45,754
<i>Grazie.</i>

664
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,911
<i># Where the road is dark</i>

665
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:58,593
<i># And the seed is sown
Where the gun is cocked... #</i>

666
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:02,879
Ah, that smell. I miss it.

667
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,559
What, the shithouse?

668
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:10,080
No. I don't know what it is.

669
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:14,637
Birmingham, I suppose. Small Heath.

670
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:19,671
- That smell.
- The smell brings it back.

671
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:22,719
Where'sJohn do you think, Tom?

672
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:25,440
Fuck knows.

673
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:28,471
Well, he's gone, though.

674
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:30,279
Like a hole behind your head.

675
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,711
Thought you thought
there was are heaven.

676
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:38,995
No. More like hell for ourJohn.

677
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:41,920
No, neither one.

678
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:45,913
He's just not here anymore.

679
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:51,592
<i># Now I been out in the desert</i>

680
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:56,190
<i># Just doin' my time</i>

681
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:00,070
<i># Searchin' through the dust</i>

682
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:03,631
<i># Lookin' for a sign</i>

683
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,117
<i># If there's a light up ahead... #</i>

684
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,999
It's like with Grace, Arthur...

685
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:12,440
They're just gone,

686
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,719
just fucking gone.

687
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:18,390
<i># I got this fever burnin '
in my soul #</i>

688
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:48,872
<i># On a gathering storm comes
a tall handsome man #</i>

689
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:53,074
<i># In a dusty black coat
with a red right hand #</i>
