00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:33,950
CRASH

2
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,494
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, EVENTS,

3
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:38,955
GROUPS, AND BACKGROUNDS
IN THIS WORK ARE FICTIONAL

4
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,524
A LATE-NIGHT DRIVER HITS
NEWLYWEDS

5
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:07,692
RESULTING IN THEIR DEATH

6
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:10,028
THE CAUSE IS DRIVER'S FAILURE
TO OBSERVE THE ROAD

7
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,711
OCTOBER, 2014

8
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,588
It's getting late. Why not stay over?

9
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,966
What's the rush? I'm disappointed.

10
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:16,719
My schedule is packed until I leave,
so now is the only time I have.

11
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:21,099
- Don't worry. I'll be back soon.
- All right. Drive safely.

12
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:23,184
Okay. I'll be back.

13
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,730
For goodness' sake.

14
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:31,276
If you're so worried about him,
how will you let him study abroad?

15
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:34,154
If you're so worried, why not follow him?

16
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:35,405
My goodness.

17
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:57,302
…<i>Is closed due to an accident.</i>

18
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:59,929
<i>Tomorrow at 4 p.m., you--</i>

19
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,640
<i>Hello, everyone.</i>

20
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:03,975
<i>This is a late-night</i>--

21
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:13,067
Darn it.

22
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,925
<i>Last night at</i>
<i>Eundong Junction in Eunseong-gu, Daejeon,</i>

23
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:39,219
<i>newlyweds who were crossing the road</i>

24
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:42,013
<i>were killed in a car crash.</i>

25
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:44,057
<i>According to the police,</i>
<i>the driver was Mr. Cha</i>…

26
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,559
…<i>a 24-year-old KAIST graduate.</i>

27
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,436
<i>He was returning to his dorm to pack up</i>

28
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:51,189
<i>prior to his departure to study abroad</i>
<i>next week</i>…

29
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:54,943
…<i>when he caused this accident.</i>
<i>After investigating the accident,</i>

30
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:57,320
<i>the police said that Mr. Cha</i>…

31
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,657
Did you drink the day before?

32
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:04,744
You left the house early in the morning,

33
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:07,121
so you couldn't have gotten enough sleep.

34
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,581
Do you remember the accident?

35
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:28,101
How many times did I tell you to leave?

36
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:29,894
Just leave! Please!

37
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:35,275
Even if you do that…

38
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,193
…my daughter won't come back to life!

39
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:41,990
Even if you hang your heads,
it won't make the dead come back alive!

40
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,160
We're sorry.

41
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:52,792
All we can say is that we're sorry.

42
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,961
Don't waste your time on these people.

43
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,380
Please leave.

44
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:00,967
You're only making us feel uncomfortable.

45
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,885
You don't know how I feel.

46
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,805
You'll only know how I feel
when your child dies too!

47
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:07,724
- You won't know how I feel!
- Stop it!

48
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:10,476
Honey, that's enough.

49
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:12,979
Let's go inside.

50
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:17,942
We're sorry.

51
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:19,527
Let's go inside.

52
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:25,950
Honey.

53
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,748
THE LATE LEE HYUNSOO
MAY YOU REST IN PEACE

54
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:11,139
CRASH

55
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:13,891
EPISODE 4

56
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:19,939
KAIST GRADUATE KILLS WOMAN
IN HER 20S IN CAR ACCIDENT

57
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,734
DETECTIVE IN CHARGE
OF NEWLYWED CAR CRASH

58
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,695
RECEIVES DISCIPLINARY MEASURES

59
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,866
DURING THE INVESTIGATION
OF THE NEWLYWEDS FROM DAEGU

60
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:33,703
IT TURNS OUT THAT
LIEUTENANT JUNG CHAEMAN…

61
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:46,215
WITNESS CLAIMS CAR SWERVED

62
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,342
THREE HIGH-SCHOOLERS STATED
THAT THEY WITNESSED THE SCENE…

63
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:07,236
According to the investigation…

64
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,446
All right.

65
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:27,131
We're still newlyweds.

66
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:49,654
A CRIME IS CONCEALED
BY ANOTHER CRIME

67
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:18,849
What's that?

68
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,382
Was that you, Cha Yeonho?

69
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:36,260
Gee, I'm sorry. I am in a hurry.

70
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,473
Take that, you punk.

71
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,108
For goodness' sake.

72
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,172
Geez.

73
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,217
That jerk.

74
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,262
Hello.

75
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:22,682
Superintendent.

76
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:25,059
I'm glad I ran into you.

77
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:27,395
- Here.
- What is it?

78
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:29,855
- A case.
- What? That's so sudden.

79
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:33,317
A case always comes suddenly.
Should it come with a warning?

80
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:38,531
Her words were quite harsh.
What's up with her?

81
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,200
Inspector Cha.

82
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,452
Why are you so deep in thought?

83
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:47,081
What's wrong?
It looks like you didn't get any sleep.

84
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,167
I'll see you inside.

85
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:58,092
One is harsh and the other is gloomy.

86
00:11:58,175 --> 00:11:59,468
What's up with everyone?

87
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:02,888
Chief Gu reprimanded
Superintendent Yeom yesterday

88
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,807
for the indiscipline
of the Traffic Bureau.

89
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:08,686
His issue was that the parking lot reform
came from the Traffic Bureau.

90
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:10,896
My goodness. It was a jab at us.

91
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,859
I mean, he went on about the police reform
and got rid of it on his own.

92
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:17,862
Why is he complaining now? How ridiculous.

93
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:19,697
That wasn't how he felt inside.

94
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,491
I hate people who aren't the same inside.

95
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,201
What do you call those people?

96
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:26,328
Two-faced, duplicitous,

97
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,538
double-dealing,

98
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:31,542
- fickle--
- That's enough. Two-faced people.

99
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:34,587
If we aren't going to watch the video,
I'll go back to--

100
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,755
Let's watch it.

101
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:37,757
- Donggi.
- Okay.

102
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:41,510
It happened last night at 11:41 p.m.

103
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,181
- <i>What's that?</i>
- My goodness.

104
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,599
A woman jumped out, right?

105
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:47,933
I think so.

106
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,101
Was it an escape?

107
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,065
The woman who jumped out
is Kim Minju, age 25.

108
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:57,735
She's currently in the ICU
at Dongsung Hospital.

109
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:59,570
The driver is Yang Jaeyoung, age 29.

110
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:02,698
According to him,
Kim Minju, who was in the passenger seat,

111
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:06,202
suddenly felt tightness in her chest
and jumped out before he could stop her.

112
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,037
What's their relationship? Lovers?

113
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,622
She's a secretary at his father's company.

114
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:14,084
I want to know how the victim's doing.
We need to check if his statement is true.

115
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:15,586
I'll go to the hospital.

116
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:18,005
Donggi, Hyunkyung, question Yang Jaeyoung.

117
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:20,174
Check his criminal records
and driving history.

118
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:21,091
Okay.

119
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,359
She had
a traumatic cerebral hemorrhage,

120
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:40,486
along with pelvic and backbone fractures.

121
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:43,405
She is out of the woods now,
but the hemorrhage is severe

122
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:46,408
so it's hard to predict
how long the coma will last.

123
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:50,037
I understand.

124
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,378
What is it? Let's go.

125
00:13:58,921 --> 00:13:59,922
Okay.

126
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,478
Even during university,

127
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:19,024
she never asked us for help.

128
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,326
I haven't done anything for her
as a parent.

129
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,496
She moved to Seoul alone
and found her footing.

130
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:34,707
She got a job.

131
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,711
She sent us living expenses every month.

132
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:42,089
She may be the daughter,
but she's the breadwinner of the house.

133
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,592
By any chance,

134
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:48,095
did she have a physical condition?

135
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,890
She had a bad back.

136
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,685
But she never had tightness in her chest.

137
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:59,690
Does she have a boyfriend?

138
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:01,859
Not that I've heard of.

139
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,364
Did she ever tell you anything

140
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,199
about the driver, Yang Jaeyoung?

141
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:13,704
Well…

142
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:17,875
Ma'am, please tell us
even if it's something small.

143
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:23,505
Minju told me about
the son of the chairman she worked for.

144
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,883
His behavior was a bit…

145
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:29,803
Apparently, he hit on
female employees often.

146
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,889
Even though he is married.

147
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:37,102
I don't know if that's the driver.

148
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,187
I see.

149
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:52,826
SEOUL NAMGANG POLICE STATION

150
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:56,455
My goodness.

151
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:05,631
TCI?

152
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:10,427
Geez, what a lousy team.

153
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:14,598
What's this smell?

154
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,893
LEE DUDONG
RETALIATORY DRIVING CASE

155
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,270
The shade is very dark. Can you see us?

156
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:22,272
- Yes.
- You can see us.

157
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:28,988
What's your relationship
with the passenger, Kim Minju?

158
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,324
She's just an employee
at my father's company.

159
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,494
- I saw her in passing a few times.
- I see.

160
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,496
Why did you meet her that day?

161
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:40,749
I'd talked about buying her dinner
and kept my word that day.

162
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,920
It felt rude to make her take a taxi,
so I was giving her a ride.

163
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,298
WIFE, SEO YEWON

164
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:49,508
You have a wife.

165
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:50,718
Yes.

166
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:55,931
She's at home.

167
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,599
- Oh, I see.
- Hmm.

168
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:01,770
Did you have an interest in Kim Minju?

169
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:05,566
Or maybe she had expressed
an interest in you.

170
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,901
I told you earlier.

171
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,362
She's just an employee.

172
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,450
What did you talk about in the car?

173
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,076
Nothing much.

174
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,370
We talked over dinner,

175
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,206
so we just listened to music in the car.

176
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,626
When did she begin
to experience tightness in her chest?

177
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,254
Was it right before she jumped out
or earlier?

178
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:28,881
Right before she jumped out.

179
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:32,176
In any case, she is quite strange.

180
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,386
I didn't realize this at work,

181
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,764
but she seemed to have a mental issue.

182
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:39,266
- What kind?
- You know what women are like.

183
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:41,351
She seemed paranoid.

184
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:53,697
Before Kim Minju jumped out of the car,

185
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:56,617
was there any type of physical contact?

186
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:07,127
If there wasn't, you can simply say so.

187
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:08,837
There wasn't.

188
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:11,090
I see.

189
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:15,385
Would it be okay for us
to check the dashcam videos?

190
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:18,931
You have a dashcam, don't you?

191
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:20,724
I do,

192
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:22,893
but I can refuse, right?

193
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:27,773
Well, yes. We can't force you
to give it to us.

194
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,071
Check all you want. Hmm.

195
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:36,865
Okay. Thank you.

196
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:39,034
Please excuse me.

197
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:50,963
What's this?

198
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,632
Oh, wow. Cool frog car.

199
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,134
Goodness.

200
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:58,846
What? Lieutenant.

201
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:01,390
- Where are you guys going?
- Well…

202
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:05,727
He's Mr. Yang Jaeyoung,
the driver of the car with Kim Minju.

203
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,909
I see. I'm Lieutenant Min Sohee.

204
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,327
Did the questioning go well?

205
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,497
I can go, right?

206
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:28,417
Yes.

207
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:31,128
What?

208
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,715
I've seen you somewhere.

209
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:37,342
Don't you know me?

210
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,722
CHA YEONHO

211
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:42,973
Cha Yeonho?

212
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:44,892
Cha Yeon…

213
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:56,111
- Right.
- Do you know each other?

214
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,529
No.

215
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:58,947
I was mistaken.

216
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,283
Have a good day.

217
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:07,414
Let's go.

218
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:08,498
Okay.

219
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:11,877
Did he answer the questions?

220
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,220
The audio was turned off.

221
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:24,097
Must be why he handed it over.

222
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:27,434
- He turned it off on purpose, right?
- He must do many bad things in the car.

223
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:29,645
Did you find anything out
during the interrogation?

224
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,397
He said he was driving her home,
but the accident took place

225
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,358
at a completely different location.

226
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:37,569
I didn't dig deeper to keep him talking.

227
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:42,324
Don't you remember him?
He seemed to know you.

228
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,663
I'm not sure. I don't remember him.

229
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:51,208
His personal information
says he's from Daejeon. Maybe…

230
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:53,085
Daejeon?

231
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,045
Yes.

232
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:37,879
It hurts, you punk!

233
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,756
It was supposed to be a light sparring.

234
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:43,802
I can't believe you. Gosh.

235
00:21:57,899 --> 00:21:59,192
Cha Yeonho?

236
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:00,777
That's right. Cha Yeonho.

237
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:02,988
You know…

238
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:06,783
Jaeyeon and Jihye.

239
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:10,579
Please give us some privacy.

240
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,581
Let's have a glass of wine after.

241
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,458
- Sounds good.
- Okay.

242
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:23,508
The driver who caused
that car accident in Daejeon.

243
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:25,802
The KAIST guy.

244
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:29,806
- What about him?
- He became a police officer.

245
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,308
I saw him at the station today.

246
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:35,145
- A police officer?
- Yeah.

247
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:37,272
Isn't it absolutely ridiculous?

248
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:39,983
How could a murderer become an officer?

249
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:44,446
Korea is a truly liberal country.

250
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:47,199
Why'd you go to the police station?

251
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:51,620
I don't know.
Something that's giving me a headache.

252
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:55,165
Gosh, because of that crazy bitch.

253
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:57,876
Is it over a woman again?
Dial it down. You have a wife.

254
00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:00,670
I thought about visiting your father.

255
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:03,590
If the case has been reported,
connections are useless.

256
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:05,842
Come on. Even if it's your father?

257
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,595
That makes no sense.

258
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:13,683
Did you send it?

259
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:15,811
What?

260
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:18,688
The article about the car accident.

261
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:21,858
- Did you receive it too?
- Hey.

262
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:24,361
I received it too, you know.

263
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:26,279
I'm serious.

264
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:29,032
My wife opened it first
and asked me about it.

265
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,076
Which bastard sent it?

266
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:36,665
Could it be Kyungsoo?

267
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:39,751
- Why would he?
- Who knows? Maybe he needs money.

268
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:43,380
Besides us, he's the only one
who knows about it.

269
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,390
What is he up to these days?

270
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:55,892
I knew it. I did some digging,

271
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:58,687
because Yang Jaeyoung's car
was under his father's company.

272
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:02,607
His family has been sharing five cars
under the company name.

273
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:06,736
But their cars are all luxury cars.

274
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,239
So the car he brought was his father's?

275
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:10,615
- Yes.
- I should've known.

276
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,617
It's the company's car, not his father's.

277
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,327
Does he think it's his money?

278
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:16,788
His father's employee
in his father's company's car--

279
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:18,248
For goodness' sake.

280
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:19,833
Hello, this is TCI.

281
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:23,462
What? Did she wake up?

282
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:25,797
Ms. Kim Minju.

283
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,677
We're the police investigating your case.

284
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,973
If it's okay, we'd like to ask a question.

285
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:36,600
Do you remember

286
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:40,312
what happened in the car that day?

287
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:04,419
Lieutenant.

288
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:05,962
It's a call from the office.

289
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:10,091
- Yes?
<i>- How did it go?</i>

290
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,218
Does she remember?

291
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:14,596
Most of her memories came back.
She gave us details of the accident.

292
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:17,265
She was trying to avoid sexual harassment.

293
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,017
<i>I knew it. What a punk!</i>

294
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,937
We don't know for certain yet.
Her memory might be faulty.

295
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,356
What are you saying?
The victim said it happened.

296
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:25,941
Do you have evidence?

297
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:27,150
<i>Captain is right.</i>

298
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:29,694
<i>Without evidence,
things might get harder for her.</i>

299
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:32,864
If we check the dashcam
of the car on the other side--

300
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,407
That's impossible.

301
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:36,535
The cars were moving
at a considerable speed,

302
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:37,661
and it was nighttime.

303
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:40,330
It'll be hard to get a useful footage.

304
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:43,583
Meet with Yang Jaeyoung again.

305
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,710
Deliver Kim Minju's statement.

306
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:48,380
- Let's see how he reacts.
- Yes, sir.

307
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:51,925
For goodness' sake.
She's a crazy bitch, isn't she?

308
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:57,138
Isn't she a gold digger?
She's after my money.

309
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,015
Mr. Yang, please watch what you say.

310
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:00,725
Many women are like that these days.

311
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:03,061
They seduce married men
and backstab them later.

312
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:09,401
- You said you were driving Kim Minju home.
- Yes.

313
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:11,444
Why did you go in the opposite direction?

314
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:16,533
I just wanted to go for a drive.

315
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:19,869
Not the vacation home?
You were headed toward Wonseong-gu.

316
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:22,664
That's nonsense! Geez.

317
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,667
I have a family.

318
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,712
Ms. Kim Minju claimed
that she repeatedly asked to get out.

319
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:32,048
What's this?

320
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:33,925
Are you suspecting me?

321
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:39,973
I can't believe it. Okay.

322
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:41,641
I have nothing more to say.

323
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:44,519
Bring evidence.
And tell her to sue me if she wants.

324
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:47,939
I'll sue her for defamation
and false accusations.

325
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:50,025
The police?

326
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:53,320
They're just writing a damn novel. Huh?

327
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:13,840
Myunghak, welcome.

328
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:15,800
Gosh, I can open the door.

329
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:18,803
I should open the door
since I'm younger than you.

330
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,764
- Goodness.
- Let's go inside.

331
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:28,688
<i>Can't your father help?</i>

332
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:31,191
I told you. He can't help
if the case has been reported.

333
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:34,653
- Is it serious?
- <i>That bitch is making such a fuss.</i>

334
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:38,073
- Do you need a lawyer?
<i>- Hey, I have lawyers too.</i>

335
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:39,366
<i>It's just a hassle to--</i>

336
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:41,910
These guys will keep things quiet.

337
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:43,662
Only low-levels take it to court.

338
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,915
I'll send the number, so call him.

339
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:49,709
I'm hanging up.

340
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:51,544
Let's go inside.

341
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:53,838
What? You're here early.

342
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:56,341
Have you been well, Uncle?

343
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:58,677
I'm sorry. I mean Chairman.

344
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:01,763
My goodness, Jungwook.

345
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:04,683
You got even more handsome
after studying abroad in the US.

346
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:06,685
Hmm? You take after your father.

347
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:08,395
Don't be ridiculous.

348
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:10,647
I spent money on his overseas education,

349
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,982
so he needs to live as a worthy man.

350
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:15,485
Spending money doesn't make a worthy man.

351
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:19,197
Jungwook, you must have money
to be a worthy man. Got it?

352
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,116
- Okay.
- You're right.

353
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:23,743
Chairman Yang, help him
become a worthy man.

354
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:26,371
- Please sit down. Sit.
- Yes, sir.

355
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:28,915
My goodness.

356
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,169
Jungwook.

357
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:37,549
Chairman Yang is an ambitious man,
so help him by his side, okay?

358
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:45,473
I hope I'm not inconveniencing
you. You have Jaeyoung too.

359
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:49,018
Myunghak, we aren't strangers.

360
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:52,981
Jaeyoung and Jungwook played
sports together since they were kids

361
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:54,774
and drank together once they grew up.

362
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:57,485
They practically grew up as brothers.

363
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:58,570
Jungwook.

364
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,281
I believe in you.

365
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:04,826
Please help Jaeyoung by his side, okay?

366
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:06,369
Jaeyoung is--

367
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:09,748
He's my son,
but he has a long way to go.

368
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:13,710
I'll need to learn from him.
He's my superior now.

369
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:17,380
My goodness. Superior, my foot.

370
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,551
- What is it?
- My goodness.

371
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:24,846
I'll share the details
once I come back from the restroom.

372
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:28,767
Now that I'm old,

373
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:31,644
I have this problem.

374
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:35,857
Gosh. At our age,
we need to take care of the pipes.

375
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,318
I'll do your favorite activity
and have a smoke too.

376
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:41,404
My goodness.

377
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,999
Chairman Yang

378
00:29:53,082 --> 00:29:56,169
is no longer the thug who did
people's dirty work in Daejeon.

379
00:29:57,253 --> 00:29:59,631
Now, he's the owner
of a respectable company.

380
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,802
So from now,

381
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:07,138
don't get any funny ideas
and focus on finding your footing.

382
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:08,848
- Understood?
- Yes.

383
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:12,602
If you get handed over a listed company,
it'll be worth 100 billion won.

384
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:20,151
What happened with Jaeyoung?

385
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:23,738
Well, there was a trivial misunderstanding
involving a female employee.

386
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,115
I introduced him to Lawyer Sung.

387
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:29,452
What a pathetic punk.

388
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:32,372
He can't hold a candle to his father.

389
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:35,208
For goodness' sake.

390
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:41,422
- You know Cha Yeonho, right?
- What?

391
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,967
He attended KAIST
at the time of the Daejeon accident.

392
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:46,344
Oh, him.

393
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:47,929
What about him?

394
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:50,640
He became a police officer.

395
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:53,560
TCI team at Namgang Police Station.

396
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:54,978
TCI?

397
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:59,440
That team is unrelated to you, right?

398
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:25,550
Inspector Cha, Kim Minju
was moved to a general ward.

399
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:28,428
We need more information
on Yang Jaeyoung. Come with me.

400
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:29,679
Okay.

401
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:36,519
Let's go.

402
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:39,022
Here we go.

403
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:48,406
What's this?

404
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:52,660
The suspect shouldn't visit
the victim as he wishes.

405
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,495
- The suspect?
- Yes, the suspect.

406
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,497
Ms. Kim pressed charges against you.

407
00:31:57,957 --> 00:32:00,668
We just finished having
a conversation with Ms. Kim.

408
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:06,341
She wants to drop the charges
and wrap up the case here.

409
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,719
Ms. Kim, is that true?

410
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,560
Gosh.

411
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:19,854
The way you work is so…

412
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:23,566
Let's go.

413
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:34,535
Are you okay?

414
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:37,080
Did those jerks threaten you?

415
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:41,542
Even if I press charges,
there's no guarantee that I'll win.

416
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:43,962
I know that this is hard.

417
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:45,838
We'll help. We'll find the evidence.

418
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:48,383
- So if you pluck up the courage--
- No.

419
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:52,512
Why do I have to fight alone?

420
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:56,057
Why do I need to take
the difficult, painful path alone?

421
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:59,018
- Why me?
- Ms. Kim Minju.

422
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:04,065
I don't want people
to talk about me.

423
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:08,611
Thinking about what happened
is exhausting.

424
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:14,450
Please leave.

425
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:16,369
Please!

426
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:17,453
Minju!

427
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:24,168
Minju. Oh, dear. It's okay.

428
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:27,171
She doesn't want to do it.

429
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:29,007
Please leave.

430
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:31,259
It's okay. Don't cry.

431
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:37,765
It's okay. Minju, it's okay.

432
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:50,111
Kim Minju was crying so much.

433
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:51,487
She must be struggling a lot.

434
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:56,993
It's my fault. I should've filed
a restraining order.

435
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,455
You didn't have time to do that.

436
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,534
<i>I'll never forgive you.</i>

437
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,538
<i>I'll make sure you get punished.</i>

438
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:43,873
<i>How?</i>

439
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:46,334
Will you send me to prison?

440
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:50,213
Hey.

441
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:53,841
Do you think there haven't been
wenches like you before?

442
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:57,887
Shall I tell you what happened
to those girls?

443
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:04,602
<i>They got fired
and failed to find another job</i>

444
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:08,564
<i>because rumors spread that
they tried to seduce the chairman's son.</i>

445
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:18,282
Hey, you're the breadwinner of the house.

446
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:21,994
What'll happen to your parents
once you become jobless?

447
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:24,372
<i>Will you let them live in poverty?</i>

448
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:26,916
<i>How unfilial of you.</i>

449
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,668
That's enough.

450
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:34,423
You should've been born to good parents.

451
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:37,260
<i>Or you could've just dated me.</i>

452
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:14,172
<i>The doors are closing.</i>

453
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,469
So it'll end like this.

454
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:24,891
Having money and power
gives confidence to the perpetrator.

455
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:28,019
Meanwhile, the victim with no money
or power is a sinner.

456
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:31,898
It really sucks being a police officer.

457
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:33,900
That won't always be the case.

458
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:55,129
What are you doing? Huh?

459
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,047
NOTICE OF SEIZURE

460
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:56,964
What's this?

461
00:36:57,798 --> 00:37:00,134
What's this? Why aren't you answering me?

462
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:03,763
What's this?

463
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:07,225
Dad.

464
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,478
Why are there seizure notices on your car?

465
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:12,897
What's going on?

466
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:15,399
What have you been up to these days?

467
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,361
It's not like that. Hey, put that down!

468
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:20,696
- Are you the son?
- Yes.

469
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,907
A report was made
to the National Tax Service.

470
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:25,326
You're using the cars
under your father's company.

471
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:27,703
So? What about it?

472
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:30,039
They'll be seized today.

473
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:32,500
You can't use it
until the tax investigation ends.

474
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:37,421
What's he saying?

475
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:40,967
You son of a bitch.
I told you not to cause trouble.

476
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:44,553
- What the hell did you do?
- Father.

477
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:46,055
For goodness' sake.

478
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:47,807
Damn it!

479
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:32,768
I can't believe I'm riding a rental car.

480
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,187
It's embarrassing.

481
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:37,356
It's the same as a company car.

482
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,110
Are you certain it's Cha Yeonho?

483
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:44,071
I looked into it.

484
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:47,992
He's the bastard who made the report.

485
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:52,121
You must have a connection with him.

486
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:55,583
Gosh. I won't let this slide.

487
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:58,669
He's a murderer. What right does he have?

488
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:03,132
I'll make Cha Yeonho, that jerk…

489
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:06,594
take off his uniform.

490
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:09,764
Don't cause a scene.

491
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:12,892
It'll be troublesome if people start
talking about what happened.

492
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:37,166
Maybe we should have dinner.

493
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:39,335
This is enough.

494
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:48,844
When you live alone, every meal is work.

495
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:55,810
How's being a police officer?
Is the work okay?

496
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:03,692
How about driving? Not yet, right?

497
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:07,488
I still have a lot to learn.

498
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:12,159
It won't be easy.

499
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,412
Your health will suffer
more than you expect.

500
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:18,749
What brings you all the way here?

501
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:21,085
If you'd called, I…

502
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:36,183
Your expression tells me

503
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:38,602
that you received one too.

504
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:47,820
Who could've sent these letters?

505
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:56,078
My wife has cancer.

506
00:40:58,038 --> 00:41:01,459
The doctor says
that she won't make it past this year.

507
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:05,421
After that day,

508
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:09,175
my wife thought about the accident

509
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:11,719
every single day.

510
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:16,223
She went over the thoughts in her mind

511
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:18,225
over and over again.

512
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:28,611
I guess…

513
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:32,740
someone else has not forgotten
about this accident.

514
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,327
Just like my wife.

515
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:57,306
<i>The eighth victim of a series</i>
<i>of robbery and rape incidents</i>

516
00:41:57,389 --> 00:41:59,600
<i>in northwestern Seoul has emerged.</i>

517
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:03,479
<i>The eighth victim was a woman in her 20s
who lived alone on the second floor</i>

518
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:05,231
- <i>of a multifamily residential</i>…
- See?

519
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:07,066
I told you to take the back alley

520
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:09,318
after making a turn
at Namgang Seolleongtang.

521
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:12,071
There's a one-way street
in front of Siwon Supermarket.

522
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:14,615
We'll have to come out
to the main road anyway.

523
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:18,536
- You have nothing to say, right?
- Fine.

524
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:20,120
…<i>No evidence was found.</i>

525
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:21,872
Gosh, the traffic is worse here.

526
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:29,880
- What?
- That little--

527
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:31,423
Eo Hyunkyung.

528
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:32,967
- Catch him!
- Woo Donggi.

529
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,677
- Shall I go after him?
- No, it's okay. Bye, Dad.

530
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,595
- Dad, I'm going.
- Sohee, your face.

531
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:37,846
What happened?

532
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:42,059
Thank you for your hard work.
I am near Ansu Station.

533
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:45,771
A young man on an electric scooter
hit a child and ran off.

534
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:46,981
Come on!

535
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:48,857
- My goodness.
- Stop!

536
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:51,026
For goodness' sake.

537
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,444
What? Are you okay?

538
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:57,992
Stop!

539
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:01,912
- Hyunkyung.
- Yes?

540
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:06,750
My goodness!

541
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,841
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay. Move out of the way.

542
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:17,678
- Inspector Cha, catch him!
- He's a hit-and-runner!

543
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:23,934
Hey.

544
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:26,312
Are you okay? Oh, no.

545
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:37,489
- What was that?
- A hit-and-runner.

546
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:43,579
Stop right there, sir!

547
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:45,956
Who are you?
You don't need to call me "sir"!

548
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,374
For goodness' sake.

549
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:50,169
Stop right there.
Once I catch you, I'll end you.

550
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:52,379
- Why are you following me?
- Stop!

551
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:04,642
You're under arrest
for running after committing a crime.

552
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:08,562
You have the right to an attorney.
You have the right to remain silent.

553
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:09,938
- It hurts.
- Understood?

554
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:13,484
- Yes, I got it.
- Why'd you run and complicate everything?

555
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:14,401
I'm sorry.

556
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,363
- My arms.
- I'm exhausted.

557
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,823
- How did this happen?
- You're here.

558
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:21,116
- I feel dizzy.
- Here.

559
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,493
Come here.

560
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:24,995
- Take him.
- Gosh.

561
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:27,206
Oh, right. Geez.

562
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:29,917
- It's fine, take him. Go.
- Okay.

563
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:37,466
I borrowed your bicycle
because I was in a hurry.

564
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,890
Tell me if it's broken. I'll fix it.

565
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:46,684
It's new.

566
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:49,520
That isn't the problem.

567
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:52,439
Are you okay?

568
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:55,067
Yes, I'm fine.

569
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:11,917
By the way, why am I a hit-and-runner?

570
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,210
I wasn't driving a car.

571
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:16,672
An electric scooter is classified
as a motorized vehicle by law.

572
00:45:16,755 --> 00:45:18,882
That means it's the same as a motorcycle.

573
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:23,512
Since you hit a person
with a motorized vehicle and ran away,

574
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:25,723
you'll receive an aggravated sentence

575
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:29,059
according to Article Five, Clause Three.
Do you understand?

576
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:33,355
I wasn't planning to run.
I was running late, so--

577
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:34,690
I can't believe you.

578
00:45:34,773 --> 00:45:38,485
Did you assault an officer
because you were late for an appointment?

579
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:43,532
I didn't know that he was an officer.

580
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:44,616
I swear.

581
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,077
- He doesn't look like one, does he?
- Be quiet.

582
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:48,287
We'll talk at the station.

583
00:45:52,207 --> 00:45:53,834
He looks like a coder.

584
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:08,891
All right. Get out.

585
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:09,933
It's hot.

586
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:13,562
This way.

587
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:15,647
My goodness.

588
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:17,816
- Bring him in.
- Okay.

589
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:20,903
- Come here.
- Can you take off my helmet? I'm sweating.

590
00:46:20,986 --> 00:46:22,446
Quiet. It's hotter for me.

591
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:24,406
- It tickles.
- Geez.

592
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:27,659
Didn't they teach you
to make arrests at the academy?

593
00:46:28,243 --> 00:46:29,620
They did.

594
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:31,371
But you didn't think to use it?

595
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:36,460
I wasn't sure if he was
a suspect or a victim,

596
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:37,961
so I couldn't use force.

597
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:41,423
I see. So even though
you could subdue him with ease,

598
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:42,591
you didn't.

599
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:48,639
You're a police officer.
You shouldn't be so weak.

600
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:49,932
Showing your police badge

601
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:52,392
won't get criminals handcuffed easily.

602
00:46:53,352 --> 00:46:54,436
For goodness' sake.

603
00:46:57,606 --> 00:46:58,649
Follow me.

604
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:00,818
Hurry.

605
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:21,171
The police's arrest techniques

606
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:25,384
refer to the techniques that are used
to arrest a culprit or a suspect.

607
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:29,304
These techniques don't only involve
the usage of the body and tools.

608
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:33,308
They have a wider meaning
and include the speech and spirit.

609
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:37,229
A MMA fighter named Wanderlei Silva
once said this.

610
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:39,857
"I fight with my heart, not techniques."

611
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:43,569
This means that before two bodies collide,
the heart does the work.

612
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:46,822
The heart determines
who will win the fight.

613
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:50,075
That's what it means.

614
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:53,036
He has no reactions.

615
00:47:57,958 --> 00:47:59,209
You don't want to learn, right?

616
00:48:00,168 --> 00:48:04,423
You have no interest or skills in MMA
and you don't see the need for it.

617
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:06,758
Well…

618
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:14,433
Take off your glasses.

619
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:15,601
Right.

620
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:23,817
All right.

621
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:26,820
Flip me over.

622
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:29,448
You can use any method,

623
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:31,658
so just try to take me down.

624
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:35,203
If my knees touch the ground even once,
I'll call off this training.

625
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:41,543
I'll do it if you won't.

626
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:48,842
All right. That motivates you, right?

627
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:50,844
Inspector Cha.

628
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:56,934
Inspector Cha, you attack this time.

629
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:58,101
Come on.

630
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:13,200
Again.

631
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:16,912
Again.

632
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:18,080
Again.

633
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:19,206
Again.

634
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:24,795
Again.

635
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:34,972
He'll die at that rate.

636
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:37,391
She won't kill him.
She's a police officer.

637
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:39,977
I think she might.

638
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:41,395
You think?

639
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:52,489
It hurts, right?

640
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:54,449
It hurts me too.

641
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:58,036
I know that feeling more than anyone.

642
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:02,582
You feel infinitely small and helpless.

643
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:04,960
You feel infinitely pathetic.

644
00:50:05,877 --> 00:50:07,754
I used to be like that too.

645
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:11,299
But that dirty feeling made me stronger.

646
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:12,467
So,

647
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:16,221
remember that feeling and
be more enthusiastic at our next session.

648
00:50:16,888 --> 00:50:17,764
Let's go.

649
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:30,610
Weren't you too harsh
on the first day? He nearly died.

650
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:32,779
It beats getting beaten to death
by a suspect.

651
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:35,615
He should quit if he can't handle
such training.

652
00:50:44,332 --> 00:50:47,544
Didn't you know?
A joint investigation unit will be set up.

653
00:50:48,086 --> 00:50:49,588
For the serial robbery and rape case.

654
00:50:52,257 --> 00:50:53,675
Is that so?

655
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:56,636
Hello.

656
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,346
What?

657
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:00,307
Where?

658
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:02,893
I guess they didn't tell her.

659
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:05,937
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

660
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:09,191
We're coming through. Thank you.

661
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:13,528
He was a resident of this neighborhood
named Jung Geunsoo.

662
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:16,615
He didn't have a job and drank all day.

663
00:51:16,698 --> 00:51:18,450
There have been many incidents.

664
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:21,411
- When he was found, he reeked of alcohol.
- Who made the report?

665
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:25,165
A high schooler found him on her way
to school at 7 a.m. and called 911.

666
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:26,666
Then why did we get called now?

667
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:30,003
At first, we thought it was
a simple death of a drunk person.

668
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:32,047
But this.

669
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:35,050
I see. It's a pedestrian accident.

670
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:37,594
Is that where he was discovered?

671
00:51:37,677 --> 00:51:38,762
Yes, it is.

672
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:40,680
Was it a hit and run?

673
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:42,724
I don't know. Even if it was,

674
00:51:42,808 --> 00:51:45,644
the driver always feigns ignorance
when they get caught.

675
00:51:45,727 --> 00:51:47,354
Go to the National Forensic Service.

676
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:49,022
Inspector Cha and I will stay here.

677
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:50,232
- Okay.
- Okay.

678
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:54,319
Unless he fell ill from drinking too much,

679
00:51:54,402 --> 00:51:56,655
he came here every day.

680
00:51:56,738 --> 00:51:59,491
I begged him to go home yesterday,

681
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:01,493
but he drank until he couldn't walk.

682
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:05,247
At what time did he leave?

683
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:07,457
I kicked him out
when I closed the restaurant.

684
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:09,584
It was close to 1 a.m.

685
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:12,546
Did he come with someone?

686
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:15,799
Who'd drink with him? It'd end badly.

687
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:18,885
He would pick a fight with anyone
when he got drunk.

688
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:22,347
My goodness.

689
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:29,646
TOGETHER RESTAURANT

690
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:32,274
What is it?

691
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:34,025
Are you hurt?

692
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:36,945
Do you really not know?

693
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:41,283
Are you whining
because I threw you down a few times?

694
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:43,743
"Please save me."

695
00:52:45,787 --> 00:52:47,414
If this is the starting point

696
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:50,584
and the location of discovery
is the ending point,

697
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:53,587
the shortest route between the two is…

698
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:58,258
Seven factorial divided by two factorial
multiplied by five factorial…

699
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:02,220
That makes 21. There are 21 routes.

700
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:04,347
I'll take the odd numbers and you can

701
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:05,974
- take the even numbers.
- Hold on.

702
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:10,187
You haven't gotten drunk before, right?

703
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:14,149
Someone who's wasted
wouldn't care about the fastest route.

704
00:53:14,232 --> 00:53:16,735
He'd take a nap in the playground

705
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:19,988
- and pee in an alley.
- Forget about the calculations.

706
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:26,620
- Check every alley and car in the area.
- Okay.

707
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:28,830
This way.

708
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:32,542
Come on.

709
00:53:49,517 --> 00:53:51,186
You saw the victim yesterday?

710
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:53,104
Last night, I couldn't fall asleep.

711
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:55,190
So I came outside to get the laundry.

712
00:53:55,273 --> 00:53:57,609
I looked outside because it was so loud.

713
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:05,367
Hey!

714
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:09,037
<i>He was picking a fight</i>
<i>with a man in a black bucket hat.</i>

715
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,831
You jerk, don't throw away
the cigarette butt anywhere.

716
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:13,667
Why do you care?

717
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:14,918
Why wouldn't I care?

718
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:18,213
This is my neighborhood, okay?

719
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:22,801
If you're wasted,
you should just go home and sleep.

720
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,428
You jerk!

721
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:42,988
Hey, stop right there!

722
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:45,699
- He does that every day.
- Hey!

723
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:49,494
Every time he gets drunk,
he picks a fight with people.

724
00:54:49,577 --> 00:54:51,579
You don't know who the other man was?

725
00:54:51,663 --> 00:54:53,665
No, I don't. I had never seen him before.

726
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:56,543
What about his appearance?

727
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:58,878
He was pretty tall.

728
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:01,423
I didn't get a good look at his face.

729
00:55:01,506 --> 00:55:03,049
How should I put it?

730
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:05,176
He looked a bit unpleasant.

731
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:08,680
You know how some people
have a gloomy face?

732
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:13,476
Okay.

733
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:25,613
I understand that the driver
who ran off is at fault.

734
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:27,907
But if you get drunk
and pass out on the road,

735
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:29,659
the drivers would feel victimized.

736
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:32,287
On top of that, it was an alley
at night with no light.

737
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:35,457
When you're unlucky, anything can happen.
You should be careful.

738
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:38,168
Don't get drunk and sleep anywhere.

739
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:39,794
I don't even drink that much.

740
00:55:39,878 --> 00:55:42,672
What kind of a person drinks
five bottles of soju?

741
00:55:43,298 --> 00:55:46,092
We have so many cases backed up.

742
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:49,721
I'm sorry. But you know
time is crucial for a hit-and-run case.

743
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:53,516
Your face is so gaunt.

744
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:56,436
Mr. Kim, you should take care
of your health.

745
00:55:57,228 --> 00:55:59,939
When you're free,
we should grab a bite sometime.

746
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:02,776
Is the result out?

747
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:04,110
Yes, it's out.

748
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:05,362
Here you go.

749
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:07,572
But there were two cars.

750
00:56:07,655 --> 00:56:08,990
Two?

751
00:56:14,662 --> 00:56:15,997
Please look here.

752
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:19,376
Okay.

753
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:27,050
What? A man in a black bucket hat.

754
00:56:27,133 --> 00:56:29,677
He's the one the woman told us about.

755
00:56:29,761 --> 00:56:33,181
This was 50 minutes before
the fight with the victim, Mr. Jung.

756
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:36,601
I think he was wandering
around the neighborhood.

757
00:56:36,684 --> 00:56:39,312
What was he doing in the neighborhood?

758
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:40,230
We're back.

759
00:56:40,313 --> 00:56:41,898
- We're back.
- Well done.

760
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:44,234
- When will the result come out?
- I pressed Mr. Kim

761
00:56:44,317 --> 00:56:45,860
since it was a hit-and-run case.

762
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:48,446
Eo Hyunkyung, you're the best. Well done.

763
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:50,532
He was run over by two cars.

764
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:53,201
- What?
- Two cars.

765
00:56:57,622 --> 00:56:59,999
The estimated time of death
is between 2 to 4 a.m.

766
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:02,961
The cause of death is organ damage
on the neck and chest.

767
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:06,631
The tire mark shows it is
a Chinese product named Top A W306.

768
00:57:06,714 --> 00:57:09,300
The other one is
a Korean product named Next Mile.

769
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:13,054
As for Top A W306,
it's a 235 by 65R15 tire.

770
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:17,016
It's mostly used for medium-sized cars,
whereas Next Mile is used for taxis.

771
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:19,310
Then the compact car is out.

772
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:23,481
The remaining cars are the black Stinger

773
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:27,235
and the silver Festa
with the broken brake light on the left.

774
00:57:27,318 --> 00:57:28,570
And this is the only taxi.

775
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:32,699
The silver SM5 that passed by at 2:27 a.m.
We can't make out the license number.

776
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:36,244
Hyunkyung, check the CCTVs
and figure out where those two cars went.

777
00:57:36,327 --> 00:57:39,414
- Yes, sir.
- Let's catch the taxi first.

778
00:57:39,497 --> 00:57:41,458
Get a warrant before it's too late.

779
00:57:42,083 --> 00:57:44,169
And contact the Smart Company

780
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:47,881
and ask for the route of a taxi
that passed by the alley in Ansu-dong.

781
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:50,216
The Smart Company?

782
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:54,262
It's a company that manages
the GPS in public transportation.

783
00:57:54,345 --> 00:57:56,347
We just call it the Smart Company.

784
00:57:57,682 --> 00:57:59,350
Donggi, take care of the warrant.

785
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:01,478
- I'll take care of the Smart Company.
- Okay.

786
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:20,663
WELCOME TO
NAMGANG POLICE STATION

787
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:27,462
My goodness, Director.

788
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:31,382
Attention. Salute.

789
00:58:32,717 --> 00:58:33,635
At ease.

790
00:58:34,135 --> 00:58:35,678
- Hello.
- Keep up the good work.

791
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:37,096
- Hello, sir.
- All right.

792
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:38,890
I told you that you can go home.

793
00:58:38,973 --> 00:58:41,142
It's okay. I want to check out
Smart Company.

794
00:58:41,226 --> 00:58:42,477
How trustworthy.

795
00:58:43,144 --> 00:58:44,646
Thank you for your hard work.

796
00:58:44,729 --> 00:58:45,855
- Thank you.
- All right.

797
00:58:46,898 --> 00:58:49,943
- I'm Superintendent So Byunggil.
- Goodness, Superintendent.

798
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:54,822
My goodness, Min Sohee.

799
00:58:54,906 --> 00:58:56,449
Oh, wow.

800
00:58:59,285 --> 00:59:01,287
It has been a while.

801
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:02,455
Yes.

802
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:07,877
Is it our first time meeting
since last year?

803
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:09,754
- Yes.
- I see.

804
00:59:28,856 --> 00:59:30,650
Hold on. He's--

805
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:33,486
He's a new member of the team,

806
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:35,738
- Inspector Cha Yeonho.
- I see.

807
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:37,490
Nice to meet you.

808
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:39,993
You're working hard in an intense team.

809
00:59:40,785 --> 00:59:42,412
- You're working hard.
- Hello, sir.

810
00:59:42,495 --> 00:59:43,621
All right.

811
00:59:43,705 --> 00:59:46,082
- The two of us will talk for a second.
- Yes, sir.

812
00:59:46,165 --> 00:59:47,083
All right.

813
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:59,262
So you bent over to pick up a CD
while driving.

814
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:03,182
So you didn't keep your eyes on the road?

815
01:00:10,356 --> 01:00:12,275
Mr. Cha Yeonho, I think

816
01:00:13,192 --> 01:00:15,612
you should be cool and just admit it.

817
01:00:17,363 --> 01:00:21,034
You need to be honest for me to help you.

818
01:00:26,414 --> 01:00:27,248
Okay?

819
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:53,691
CRASH

820
01:01:18,966 --> 01:01:21,427
<i>Had we caught the car thief sooner,</i>

821
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:22,887
no one would've died.

822
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:25,181
- There's someone inside.
- What? Then--

823
01:01:25,264 --> 01:01:26,474
He was watching.

824
01:01:26,557 --> 01:01:27,975
<i>The wallet came back?</i>

825
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:30,687
<i>- It might be a hypocritical behavior.
- Haven't you felt it?</i>

826
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:33,272
We always lose when
Director General Lee Taeju is involved.

827
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:35,191
Please take good care of Lieutenant Min.

828
01:01:35,274 --> 01:01:37,360
Who went in my office while I was gone?
Who did it?

829
01:01:37,443 --> 01:01:39,654
You're the only one who knows about it.

830
01:01:39,737 --> 01:01:42,323
<i>Drug deals seem to be involved.</i>

831
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:44,951
<i>High-ranking police officers' children
are involved too.</i>

832
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:46,744
Those fools.

833
01:01:50,164 --> 01:01:52,500
PEOPLE OF THE POLICE STATION

834
01:01:52,583 --> 01:01:53,668
All right.

835
01:01:53,751 --> 01:01:55,712
- Hello.
- Move out of the way.

836
01:01:55,795 --> 01:01:57,880
- You shouldn't ride it in here.
- Move out of the way.

837
01:01:58,423 --> 01:01:59,632
Good.

838
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:01,551
You memorized the script, right?

839
01:02:01,634 --> 01:02:03,177
- Do I have lines today?
- Gosh.

840
01:02:03,261 --> 01:02:05,096
Hurry and go on in. People are waiting.

841
01:02:05,179 --> 01:02:06,347
All right then.

842
01:02:07,932 --> 01:02:08,933
Good.

843
01:02:11,352 --> 01:02:14,230
Have you heard of a new term,
"scooter deer"?

844
01:02:14,313 --> 01:02:15,398
SERGEANT WOO DONGGI

845
01:02:15,481 --> 01:02:17,942
It's a nickname that's given
to the electric scooter riders

846
01:02:18,025 --> 01:02:21,904
who suddenly enter the road
and startle the car drivers like a deer.

847
01:02:22,447 --> 01:02:25,241
Electric scooters became
the unwelcome guests on the road.

848
01:02:25,324 --> 01:02:29,954
So I prepared rules you must keep in mind
when riding an electric scooter.

849
01:02:35,126 --> 01:02:38,671
Firstly, you must be 16 years or older

850
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:41,716
and have a two-wheeled driver's license
to ride an electric scooter.

851
01:02:41,799 --> 01:02:45,428
So those without a license
or are younger than 16 cannot ride it.

852
01:02:45,511 --> 01:02:48,264
Secondly, electric scooters need to use

853
01:02:48,347 --> 01:02:51,517
the bicycle roads
or the rightmost lane of regular roads.

854
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:54,896
Driving the wrong way
or driving on the sidewalk is prohibited.

855
01:02:54,979 --> 01:02:58,065
Thirdly, if you ride an electric scooter
after drinking,

856
01:02:58,149 --> 01:03:00,276
it'll be treated
the same as drunk driving.

857
01:03:00,359 --> 01:03:04,197
You'll get a fine of a million won
and could get your license revoked.

858
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,531
Please keep it in mind.

859
01:03:06,866 --> 01:03:08,993
If you hit someone on the sidewalk,

860
01:03:09,076 --> 01:03:11,829
you'll receive a prison sentence
of five years or less

861
01:03:11,913 --> 01:03:15,333
or a fine of 20 million won or less
regardless of settlement.

862
01:03:15,416 --> 01:03:17,585
So when an accident occurs,
protect the victim

863
01:03:17,668 --> 01:03:19,754
and call the police right away.

864
01:03:19,837 --> 01:03:20,963
Please don't forget.

865
01:03:22,507 --> 01:03:24,509
