1
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,610
Told you. Easy as pie.

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,450
Sorry, Frankie.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,451
You're under arrest for the murder
of Leon Winkler.

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,644
- You think these guys are gonna let you?
- Shut up, Flass.

5
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,888
Penguin, you're a smart monkey.
And I'm the zookeeper.

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,168
FALCONE:
I didn't think it was going to be you.

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,647
You can come out now.
Right as usual, my friend.

8
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,881
We gotta g0!

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,924
FISH: I swear, Butch,
I'm gonna come back and kill Penguin.

10
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,724
You sure now? Fish Mooney is done?

11
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,442
She tried to bring down Falcone.
She failed.

12
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,082
Last I saw her,
Victor Zsasz had her cornered.

13
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,001
We can assume she's either dead
or extremely unwell.

14
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,521
Well, then: salud.

15
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,642
Mm. You know, this creates
some intriguing opportunities.

16
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,766
Falcone will struggle to hold on
to her territory. If we move quickly...

17
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,450
My thinking exactly.

18
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:21,962
In fact, I took the liberty of claiming
her nightclub. In your name, of course.

19
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,646
You did, huh?

20
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,805
- Good thinking.
- Heh.

21
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,088
A bird in the hand is
nine-tenths of the law.

22
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,164
Yeah. Ha, ha.

23
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,161
Phone for you, boss.

24
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,565
- Speak.
FISH [OVER PHONE]: Hello, Sal.

25
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,771
MARON I:
Hey.

26
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,642
You sound surprised. Let me guess,
your friend Penguin told you I was dead.

27
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,842
<i>- As good as.
- Mm.

28
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,771
I'm just on a vacation for a while.

29
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,561
<i>- Huh.
- I'm not going to lie.

30
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,604
<i>I thought I was gonna end up on top.
Instead, I got played.

31
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,089
<i>Turns out Penguin has been
Falcone's man the whole time.

32
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,562
They played us both for suckers.

33
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,650
- Is that right?
- Ah. Indeed.

34
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,764
He told me himself
right before I was about to gut him.

35
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,607
You understand why I might be skeptical,
considering it's you telling me this.

36
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,325
<i>Oh, wake up, dummy.

37
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,808
<i>You mean to tell me this whole time,
you haven't suspected anything?

38
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,561
That he hasn't made one slip
that he's had to explain away?

39
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,804
<i>Or maybe you wanted to believe his lies.

40
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,800
<i>But it still gnaws at you, doesn't it?
The doubt.

41
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,446
It's right there. A smudge.

42
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,880
Don't let it happen again.

43
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,924
- Maybe a <i>couple of times.
- Time to get your house in order, Salvatore.

44
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,331
And remember who put you wise.

- Not bad news, I hope.
- No.

47
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,808
I gotta go upstate. See
a guy about a thing.

48
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,044
Come with me.
We can talk about opportunities.

49
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,605
Sure. Heh.

50
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:05,923
- Just, uh, let me run home and...
- Ah-ah. We gotta go now. Right now.

51
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,170
Super. Ha, ha.

52
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,566
I love a road trip. Yay. Heh.

Harvey.

55
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,368
- Captain.
- What have we got?

56
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,131
Last night, Mr. Lucky there
got tied to that chair.

57
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,721
A noose over his neck.
He was heaved over the side.

58
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,888
Some suits this morning found him.

59
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,566
- How'd he get back up to the roof?
- See that pulley?

60
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,444
My guess, it was the killer.

61
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,201
Guy went to a lot of trouble to get him
back up. Why not leave him hanging?

62
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,164
- Morning, captain.
- Good morning, Ed.

63
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,931
The more you cut me,
the bigger I grow. What am I?

64
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,009
We're on a rooftop. Don't tempt me.

65
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,881
- A hole. I'm a hole.
- Okay. Relevance?

66
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,368
There's a hole, a surgical incision,
in our victim's abdomen.

67
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,683
Certainly postmortem.
Killer was looking for something.

68
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,123
<i>- I'll</i> examine the body at the lab.
- You mean the medical examiner.

69
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,681
- Well, but...
- You handle forensics, Ed.

70
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,530
The bodies belong to Dr. Guerra.

71
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,725
And he's made formal complaints.
I can't cover for you anymore.

72
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,409
I read you, ma'am. Loud and clear.

73
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,531
- So where's Gordon?
- Personal stuff. He'll be in soon.

74
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,844
ESSEN: Don't stand so near the edge.
- You worried about me, captain?

75
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,765
- I don't start drinking until noon.
- I gotta spell it out?

76
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,803
Detective Flass had a lot of friends.

77
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,686
And your partner arrested him for murder.
Accidents happen.

78
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,531
- You put the cuffs on him.
- So we should all be careful.

79
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,843
To hell with them.

80
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,650
Barbara?

81
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,730
- Hi.
- Let go of me.

82
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,884
- How long you been here?
- Just last night.

83
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,842
And a couple times before.
I knew your girlfriend was gone.

84
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:57,125
You got sent to guard that loony bin,
so better here than sleeping on the street.

85
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,010
- Have you seen Barbara?
- No.

86
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,521
Oh. So things are over
between you two, huh?

87
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,610
Sure you should be here?
Maybe you're the one breaking in.

88
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,929
- I came to drop off keys. Get your stuff.
- Where are you taking me?

89
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,727
Well, you're not staying here.
I'll find you someplace safe.

90
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,246
Mm. Safe.

91
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,805
Safe like Wayne Manor?

92
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,721
- That was your last great idea.
- So someplace else.

93
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,281
You're still my only witness
to the Wayne murders.

94
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,641
Hmm.

95
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,891
- Talked to Bruce since you got back?
- No. Why?

96
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,241
Because I told him already.

97
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,888
I didn't see anything. I lied.

98
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,963
Sucks about your girlfriend.
She's got some really nice stuff.

99
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,571
Hey, wait.

100
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,330
Stop.

101
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,521
Detective James Gordon to see you,
Master Bruce.

102
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,731
- Detective.
- Bruce.

103
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,285
How are you?

104
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,609
I'm fine, thank you.

105
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:12,043
I would've come by earlier,
but things were a little crazy.

106
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,891
You were gone for a while.

107
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,806
- Switzerland.
- Probably wise.

108
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,409
I saw Selina Kyle.
She told me she lied. She saw nothing.

109
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:26,123
Yes. That's what she told me.
She made up the story to get out ofjuvie.

110
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,527
She could be saying this
because she's scared.

111
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,882
It would be understandable
after what happened.

112
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,684
No.

113
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,803
She doesn't scare easily.

114
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,683
I believe her. She didn't see the killer.

115
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,121
Look, this is unfortunate.

116
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,368
It doesn't mean we're back to square one.

117
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,531
Someone sent assassins after her.
Only a guilty person would do that.

118
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,807
Yes.

119
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,923
A lot of bloody assassins to the manor.

120
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,490
Thank you very much.

121
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,964
Anyway, you need no longer
concern yourself with the case.

122
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,090
- Bruce, this isn't the time to give up.
- I'm not giving up.

123
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,241
I don't understand.

124
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,687
You promised you'd find
who killed my parents.

125
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,168
You've managed to find one witness
who turned out to be a liar.

126
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,643
- An investigation like this takes time.
- I understand.

127
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,408
But I don't want you to feel bound
by an oath you can't fulfill.

128
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,244
I'm releasing you from your promise.

129
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,486
I'll pursue the matter on my own.

130
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,530
- Bruce...
- L really wouldn't bother, actually, mate.

131
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,885
Once Master Bruce makes up his mind,
there's no arguing with him.

132
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,011
He can't pursue this case on his own.
It's too dangerous.

133
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,407
Then I'll have to look after him.

134
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,605
Can I show you the door?

135
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,486
MARONI:
Hey, sleepyhead. We're here.

136
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,200
You smell that air?

137
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,208
That's country air.

138
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,605
Let's get some chow.

139
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,889
Chow.

140
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,844
Excellent.

141
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,965
- So where's the guy?
- Which guy?

142
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,243
- The guy with the thing?
- Oh. He'll be around.

143
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,761
- You don't like the coffee?
- I like the coffee.

144
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,564
How about the oatmeal?

145
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,726
Also delicious.

146
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,888
It's good to get out of the city, huh?

147
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:45,722
Away from the fumes, the noise.
I can finally hear myself think.

148
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,130
It's all so simple, and clean,
and honest out here.

149
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,566
Fresh air, oatmeal, good friends.

150
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,250
How true.

151
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,649
In Gotham, you never have
any time to connect, to reflect.

152
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,609
- You feel that?
- Absolutely.

153
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,240
MARONI:
Mm.

154
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,762
This guy with the thing...

155
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,963
- Heh. What is the thing?
