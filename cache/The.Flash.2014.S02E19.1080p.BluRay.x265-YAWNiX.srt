1
00:00:02,377 --> 00:00:06,382
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:10,018
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

3
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:13,268
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

4
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,400
I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,898
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

6
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:22,281
but in doing so,
I opened up our world to new threats.

7
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:25,276
And I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

8
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,569
I am The Flash.

9
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,072
Previously on The Flash...

10
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:33,118
How many more terrible things
are you gonna do to protect me?

11
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:35,285
That's my job. That's all that matters.

12
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:38,171
It's my turn to go out on my own.
Don't come looking for me.

13
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:41,504
Everything seems to be telling me
that Barry and I are meant to be together.

14
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:43,089
Somebody, please help!

15
00:00:43,252 --> 00:00:45,630
There's only one person
who can help you now.

16
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:48,215
The Flash.

17
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:51,135
Barry, I know you can't give up your speed
to that monster...

18
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:52,302
That's not your decision.

19
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:53,516
Hand him over and it's yours.

20
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:54,680
He's slowing down.

21
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:55,847
He's becoming human again.

22
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:03,655
I know some piece of you did care for me.
Please, let him go.

23
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:07,739
Caitlin!

24
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:12,949
It's a regular day in Central City.

25
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,492
Nothing out of the ordinary.

26
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:19,546
People wake up, roll out of bed,

27
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:22,712
suit up for the day.

28
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:26,049
Get to work as fast as they can.

29
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,472
Make sure they get a caffeine fix
along the way,

30
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:32,347
so they can make it through
the mountain of work that awaits them.

31
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:58,035
Yeah.

32
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:10,889
Yep, it's just a regular day.

33
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:15,344
And I'm just a regular guy.

34
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:26,071
I really wish we didn't have to keep
Jay's helmet around.

35
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:28,231
- I hate this thing.
- Well...

36
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,238
Just wanna put a dent in it.

37
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:33,245
Cisco, did you see Caitlin in your vibe?

38
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:39,372
Zoom's got her in his lair.
She's scared, but she's okay.

39
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,788
Thank God.
All right, we need to get her back.

40
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:44,414
I know, but without your speed,

41
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,254
there's no way any of us
can get through that breach

42
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,918
that Cisco found at the hospital.

43
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,053
I just don't think there's anything
we can do right now.

44
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:52,260
That's right.
And it's thanks to you, Allen.

45
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:53,799
Enough, we're all suffering here.

46
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:55,717
That's right, that's right, Detective.
We're all suffering.

47
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:59,138
We've lost Snow, you've lost your speed,
and now?

48
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:03,605
Now, Zoom can come through that breach
any time he wants.

49
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:06,987
And that, Allen, that's on you.

50
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:11,025
Hey, that's on all of us, okay?
We made these decisions as a team.

51
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:14,949
No, we didn't.

52
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:17,614
And where are you going?

53
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:22,537
I'm gonna go find Jesse before Zoom does.
Again.

54
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:24,501
Wait, you found her? How?

55
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:26,256
Cellular dead zones, Ramon.

56
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:28,129
People from my Earth

57
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,589
vibrate at a different frequency
than people from your Earth.

58
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:32,720
They leave cellular dead zones
wherever they go.

59
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,715
That's why
I'm always dropping calls around you?

60
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,849
Okay, so, wait. How did that help?

61
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:41,309
I track the dead zones created by Jesse
since she got here

62
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,223
and I follow the trail, it's easy.

63
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,893
What?
So, you think you're gonna need that gun

64
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,232
to convince her to leave with you?

65
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,652
You're full of questions today,
aren't you, West?

66
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:52,987
The gun is not for my daughter.

67
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,199
She's not the only person from
a different Earth hiding out on this one.

68
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,784
If I run into them, I'm gonna need this.

69
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,162
Okay, but you're also gonna need
some help.

70
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,497
Really?

71
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:07,001
You know anyone
with the speed to help me, Ramon?

72
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,291
Well...

73
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:12,802
Great. I'll be in my workshop.

74
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,637
Don't listen to Wells, Barry.
This ain't all on you.

75
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:20,890
Yeah, I know.

76
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,021
You need a ride back to the station?

77
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:26,725
No, I'm good.
I'm gonna stick around, actually.

78
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:28,815
Finished all my cases this morning.

79
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,353
Damn, that was fast.

80
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,355
That was a poor choice of words.

81
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:36,281
You do know it's okay to ease back into
the way you used to do things, right?

82
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:40,285
Well, this is the only way
I can fight crime.

83
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:42,870
If I'm not The Flash,
that's what I gotta do.

84
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,229
You need to eat.

85
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:12,486
Caitlin.

86
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:15,949
If you wanna speak to me,
then take off that mask.

87
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:20,783
Does this make you feel better?

88
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,369
Nothing you could ever do
would make me feel better.

89
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:26,660
You don't need to be afraid.

90
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm not gonna hurt you.

91
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,462
I care too much about you to do that.

92
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,794
You only care about yourself.

93
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:38,713
Hunter.

94
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:40,715
Hunter.

95
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:42,968
You're gonna wanna see this, son.

96
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,135
No!

97
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,267
I know you think that I'm a monster.

98
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:48,932
I understand why.

99
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:54,938
But that'll change.

100
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,276
- Please, Cait.
- Do not call me that!

101
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:04,661
Why are you keeping me here? You're cured.
You don't need me for anything.

102
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:07,827
You're here because I love you.

103
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,706
It may take a while, but someday

104
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:16,127
you'll start feeling that way
about me again, too.

105
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:21,340
Make yourself at home.

106
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:24,806
You're gonna be here awhile. Okay?

107
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:07,348
I don't understand.

108
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,389
Well, hello, doppelganger of mine.

109
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:13,851
What do you know,

110
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:17,028
I can still pull off brunette.

111
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:23,406
Dad.

112
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:26,662
Oh, hey, son. What a surprise. What's up?

113
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:31,201
Uh, I, I wanted to ask you
about something. Someone, actually.

114
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,291
Uh... The Flash.

115
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:35,955
What about him?

116
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:40,051
Well, he showed up at my street race
when Iris got hurt,

117
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:43,847
then when that man-shark thing
attacked our house.

118
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:49,520
And when Zoom took me, he said
someone The Flash knew cared about me.

119
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:53,268
Yeah, it doesn't take a genius
to figure out that that's you.

120
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:58,611
If you want me to tell you who he is?
I can't do that.

121
00:07:58,770 --> 00:07:59,896
No, I know, I know.

122
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:02,566
I was actually hoping
that you could set up a meeting for me.

123
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:04,451
A meeting? Between you and him?

124
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,613
I... I don't know
if I can do that, either, Wally.

125
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:08,913
Well, why not?

126
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:11,746
Joe? Singh wants to see you.

127
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,034
Okay. Um...

128
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:17,419
Look, maybe one day, but not now.

129
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,466
Look, I gotta get to work.

130
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:23,128
See you at home? All right.

131
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,266
The laser tag club's in 2D.

132
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:41,108
- The? Oh, no.
- Uh, I'm looking for Jesse.

133
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:43,030
Come on in.

134
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:45,108
Thanks.

135
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:48,741
Jesse!

136
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:52,616
You're the first person
who's ever come to visit her.

137
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,205
- What? Oh.
- How'd you find me?

138
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:02,133
Jess. Uh, cellular dead zone.

139
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:03,839
I told you I'd find you wherever you went.

140
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,300
Wait, so, you're a runaway?

141
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:08,344
So you're her dad.

142
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:11,472
Great. Let me know
if I need to find a new roommate.

143
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:18,813
Listen. We need to go.

144
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:22,696
So, what?
You think I'll be safer with you?

145
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:24,314
Yes.

146
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:29,403
Yeah, I think I'm gonna pass.

147
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,620
Jesse, we need to leave.

148
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:36,793
No. Okay? No, I'm not going anywhere
with you, ever again.

149
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,077
You are...

150
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:43,171
You're in danger. Do you understand?
You're in grave danger.

151
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:46,928
I know! I'm in danger because of you.

152
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,589
- Because of me?
- Yeah!

153
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:51,304
Okay, everything that's happened,
it's your fault.

154
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:54,720
Zoom hunting us, the metas, moving here.

155
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:58,022
I'm done with it, okay?
You wanted me to start a new life

156
00:09:58,181 --> 00:09:59,353
and that is exactly what I'm trying to do.

157
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:01,894
- No, Jess. Jess.
- You killed a man!

158
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,814
I can't just forgive you for that.

159
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:10,865
And I may be afraid of Zoom,
but... I am just as afraid of you.

160
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,322
Please, just go.

161
00:10:14,346 --> 00:10:16,346
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

162
00:10:57,365 --> 00:11:00,960
And a new report shows
that petty crimes have risen slightly,

163
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,079
sparking concern that The Flash...

164
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:05,005
Don't watch that.

165
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:07,334
Cisco, everybody's gonna realize
sooner or later,

166
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,592
that I don't have my speed.

167
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,469
The later, the better.
The last thing we need,

168
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,801
is every criminal in this city
thinking they're untouchable, right?

169
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,092
- What is that?
- Case in point.

170
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:19,183
What? What is that?

171
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:23,229
- It's Harry.
- What about Harry?

172
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,689
The camera in the lab van
recorded an accident.

173
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:27,604
See, this is my version of Crash Assist.

174
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,613
It's like those Russian dash-cams,
but, you know,

175
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:32,776
without attack helicopters
and bad pop music on the radio.

176
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:43,040
That does not look like an accident.

177
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:46,130
First, Caitlin's taken. Now, Wells.

178
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,135
This is where he got taken,

179
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:52,762
but there aren't any traffic cams
in that area.

180
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:54,594
I'm gonna head out there,
see what I can find.

181
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:56,929
I'll analyze this footage
and see if we can figure out who this is.

182
00:11:57,091 --> 00:12:00,220
All right. Wait, uh, where's
the last place the van stopped?

183
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:04,186
Woodman and Shore for about 15 minutes
before heading back to Central City. Why?

184
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:05,396
That's where Jesse must be.

185
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,356
She should know
if something's happened to her dad.

186
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:10,943
Iris, hey. Need your help with something.

187
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,818
You're Killer Frost.

188
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,986
And you're Caitlin Snow.

189
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:20,327
Your little friend Cisco
wouldn't shut up about you.

190
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,084
Made you out to be some kind of a saint.

191
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,334
So, tell me. Why hide the girls?

192
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,590
I mean, you've seen our body, right?

193
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:34,888
If I could get my powers
to work through this carbyne wall,

194
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:38,516
the first thing lwould do is shut him up.

195
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:39,676
Who is he?

196
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:42,015
Don't know, don't care.

197
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:45,853
But if he's here,
Zoom must need something from him.

198
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,694
So, what does Zoom need you for?

199
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:54,358
That is an excellent question, Caity.

200
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,826
You know,
I've been asking myself the same thing.

201
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:02,954
But doesn't matter now.
I'm not gonna stick around much longer.

202
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:06,248
Wait, I thought you said
your powers don't work inside this cell.

203
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:08,914
They don't, you're right.

204
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:11,086
So, you're gonna help me get out of here.

205
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,421
Why would I help you?

206
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:15,052
Listen, honey, there's no way

207
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,805
you are making it down that cliff
all by yourself.

208
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:20,801
So, let's make a deal.

209
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:25,894
You get me out of this box,
and I'll help you get home.

210
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:29,401
Might even throw in
some wardrobe tips for free.

211
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:35,319
So, what do you say, Caitlin?
Do we have a deal?

212
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,913
I don't understand.

213
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:51,589
There's nothing around here.
What did the van hit?

214
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,546
I don't know.

215
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:59,009
Something strong enough to exert
an equal amount of force back on the van.

216
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:05,558
Someone was definitely here, though.

217
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,438
You think maybe a meta-human?

218
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:09,766
Yeah.

219
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,856
And if it's a meta that's after Wells...

220
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,396
Then they could be from Earth-2.

221
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:16,986
Probably.

222
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:20,197
We gotta get Jesse, find Wells. Fast.

223
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,353
Dr. Harrison Wells.

224
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,098
Yeah. And who are you?

225
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,142
Name's Griffin Gray.

226
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,311
Griffin Gray?

227
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:57,234
Do I know you?

228
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,320
No. But you should.

229
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,197
I'm one of your mistakes.

230
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:06,114
One of your sins coming home to roost.

231
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,457
All right, you think I...

232
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:12,208
I'm from... I'm not who you think I am.

233
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,838
I know exactly who you are!

234
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:18,881
And you're gonna fix
what your particle accelerator did to me.

235
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,629
What did the accelerator do to you?

236
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:35,893
That.

237
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:37,611
Well, that's impressive.

238
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:39,776
And all things considered,

239
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,361
I don't know that
having that kinda strength

240
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:43,026
is the worst thing
you could have been given.

241
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:47,367
Yeah, that's what I thought at first.
And it was a lot of fun.

242
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:51,622
Till I learned
it did something else to me, too.

243
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,083
That's me.

244
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,040
Last year.

245
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,840
You're... You're aging.

246
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:05,260
If this keeps happening,
I'll be dead in a few months.

247
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:07,884
How old are you, Griffin?

248
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,312
I'm 18.

249
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:18,148
Look.

250
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:25,236
I'm sorry this is happening to you.
There's nothing I can do to fix it.

251
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,870
Well, that sucks.

252
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:32,082
'Cause if you can't figure out a way
to help me, Dr. Wells...

253
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,128
You're gonna die soon, too.

254
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,097
I never should have left.

255
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:48,675
No, this isn't your fault.

256
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:50,635
D0 you know who took him?

257
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:54,396
That's where things get interesting.
That fingerprint that you guys brought in?

258
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:57,058
- The one from the van, I mean.
- Yeah, yeah.

259
00:16:58,059 --> 00:16:59,151
Belongs to this guy.

260
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:03,982
Griffin Gray.
A senior at Central City High School?

261
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:06,659
No, wait.
I've seen this kid's picture before.

262
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:08,364
He went missing like six months ago.

263
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:09,529
That's right.

264
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:12,244
That doesn't make any sense.
An 18-year-old didn't kidnap Wells.

265
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,704
That's what I thought at first,
but feast your eyes on this.

266
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,206
Wow!

267
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:22,466
It's the same guy!

268
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,423
Yeah, the blood sample confirms it.

269
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:25,677
How is that even possible?

270
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:29,886
I'm not sure yet. Without Caitlin here,
I can't really analyze the cells

271
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,801
on a molecular level
to see what we're dealing with here.

272
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:33,220
You know,
I might actually be able to help.

273
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:36,022
- How?
- Bio-chem was one of my majors in college.

274
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,224
One of your majors? How many did you have?

275
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:39,809
Five.

276
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,816
What? ls that not common here?

277
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:44,902
Girl, no. That is not common anywhere.

278
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:48,033
All right, let's search for that Gray,
see what we come up with.

279
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,660
I'll see if facial recognition
brings him up

280
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,988
and I'll have Joe check
C.C.P.D.'s database.

281
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,829
Cool. Let's see what you can do.

282
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,041
Tick-tock, tick-tock.

283
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:01,922
I'm going as fast as I can.

284
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:05,460
Well, you'd better go faster.
Zoom will be back any minute.

285
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,594
I could just leave you in there,
you know.

286
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:08,754
Oh.

287
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:11,804
But you want to go home so badly.

288
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,186
So, how did this happen to you?

289
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:18,181
Woke up one day,

290
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,349
cold, pale,

291
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:22,151
thought I was sick.

292
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:25,188
Turned out it was something else entirely.

293
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:29,492
You got hit by the dark matter
from the particle accelerator explosion?

294
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:34,365
Yes. Right after I flunked out
of med school.

295
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:37,037
Had to move back in with my mother.

296
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:42,038
That couldn't have been fun.
If she's anything like mine, I mean.

297
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:46,050
Why, is yours a frigid narcissist, too?

298
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,209
Cold as ice.

299
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:51,514
Yeah, Mom was like that
ever since Charlie died.

300
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,011
Who's Charlie?

301
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:54,513
My brother.

302
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:56,181
I never had a brother.

303
00:18:56,427 --> 00:19:00,477
No? Then why was Mom such a bitch
on your Earth?

304
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:03,226
Honestly, I couldn't say.

305
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:11,034
So, how is this
going to get me out of here?

306
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:15,572
The electrical current in the cable
should heat up the carbyne,

307
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:18,241
which, in turn,
should speed up the electrons.

308
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:19,788
And the faster they go...

309
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,294
The weaker
its molecular structure becomes.

310
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:23,913
Exactly.

311
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,423
Hmm.

312
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,713
I studied every once in a while.

313
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:30,052
Well, when it gets hot enough,

314
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:32,760
it should make the carbyne
as fragile as glass.

315
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:36,601
And then we can both get out of here.

316
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:47,149
Wally.

317
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:48,729
Hey, Joe.

318
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:52,325
What's up? You look like
you got something on your mind.

319
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:54,110
Yeah, I do.

320
00:19:56,696 --> 00:20:00,621
Please don't tell me you drove all the way
over here to ask about The Flash again.

321
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,416
It's not happening, Wally.

322
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:07,294
Wha... It's just one time,
that's all I'm asking.

323
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:08,795
It's impossible.

324
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:12,963
He saved my life, Joe.
I owe him a thank you.

325
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,300
Look.

326
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:22,605
I've been reckless my whole life.

327
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:25,850
Racing cars, pushing limits.

328
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,978
I did everything at full speed
without a care in the world.

329
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:33,908
But it wasn't until Zoom took me,

330
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,741
that I really thought I was gonna die.

331
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:43,497
And I was going to die
if The Flash didn't do what he did.

332
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:50,170
He gave up his powers to save me,
a guy he didn't even know.

333
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:54,630
No one's ever done anything like that
for me before.

334
00:20:57,465 --> 00:20:59,388
I need to tell him
how much that means to me.

335
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:06,228
Well, all right.

336
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,022
Uh.

337
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:13,523
Just give me a little while,
I'll see what I can do.

338
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:17,902
L gotta go.

339
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:27,961
Hey, Dad.

340
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,539
Thanks.

341
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:40,558
- Yo.
- In here.

342
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:42,761
I got your text. What's up?

343
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:44,929
All right,
facial recognition just picked up Gray

344
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:47,393
breaking into Ace Chemical
down on Newbury Road.

345
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,893
- Is my dad with him?
- I don't know yet. But we have to go.

346
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:51,561
- Uh, you sure about that?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

347
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,195
Look, we can'tjust sit here.

348
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:55,277
Regardless of whether
I have my speed or not,

349
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,191
I have to try to help,
that's never gonna change.

350
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,653
Okay. I'm with you,
but we're gonna need some backup.

351
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,072
- Joe's on his way.
- And I'm coming with.

352
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:03,239
No, look, uh, pleasejust stay here.

353
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:04,577
We don't know what we're dealing with yet.

354
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,287
Just finish running the tests
on the blood sample.

355
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,077
I'm sorry. Thank you, Jesse.

356
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:36,818
Griffin Gray, C.C.P.D.!
Stay right there.

357
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:40,283
The man that you kidnapped,
Harrison Wells.

358
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:42,032
You need to let him go.

359
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:44,572
I can't do that. Not yet.

360
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:46,915
Then we'll have to do this the hard way.

361
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,291
I guess so.

362
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:57,965
Okay, He-Man's got some power.

363
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:03,219
And accuracy.

364
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,225
- All right, keep him distracted, okay?
- What?

365
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:07,811
Barry! Barry!

366
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:09,472
Ican do this all night.

367
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:13,817
We just want Wells. Just let him go!

368
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:15,978
Not until I'm done with him!

369
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:33,830
Too slow.

370
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:46,804
- Barry!
- Hey.

371
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:49,352
I think I need some medical attention.

372
00:23:57,186 --> 00:23:59,188
So, his genes have actually mutated.

373
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:01,653
I ran the DNA from the blood sample
Barry found

374
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:05,365
and the functional myostatin in his cells
is essentially gone.

375
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,867
I mean, giving him super-strength.

376
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:12,627
Guys, there's something else.
Um, I saw him age. Right in front of me.

377
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:14,750
Yeah, he's suffering from
oxidative stress.

378
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:20,009
It means the protein and the DNA
in his body are being ravaged by oxidants.

379
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:22,716
So, what?
He needs to up his blueberry intake?

380
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:28,643
No, it means, the more he
exerts himself, the faster he ages.

381
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,513
So, if we can get him
to exert too much energy, then...

382
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,398
Then he'll become old and weak.

383
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,149
And how do you think
we're gonna do that?

384
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:40,651
I can't watch you be a human punching bag
until he turns into Grampa Simpson.

385
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,610
I think we can fix that.

386
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:45,492
Jesse, I'm gonna need
some of that quick thinking of yours.

387
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:47,449
Iris.

388
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:50,865
I gotta get back to the station.

389
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:00,128
You Okay?

390
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:04,087
No, not really.

391
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:08,929
You know, you were the first person
I saved after I got my powers.

392
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:15,314
We were out on a walk

393
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,234
and we were talking about Eddie

394
00:25:18,392 --> 00:25:20,520
- Hmm-mmm.
- And how you were with him,

395
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:24,566
and I was thinking to myself how
I'd missed a lot while I was in that coma.

396
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:29,620
And then, all of a sudden,
those cars came at us,

397
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:32,615
and it was like the world froze.

398
00:25:34,575 --> 00:25:36,748
Like you and I
were the only two people in the world.

399
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:42,501
I didn't even know what I could do yet.
But I knew that I could save you.

400
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:45,590
And I did.

401
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:49,598
And now, I don't know, I don't...

402
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:55,518
I Just don't even know who I am anymore,
or who I'm supposed to be.

403
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:01,526
Barry, you're supposed to be the same guy
that you've always been.

404
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:05,489
Suit or no suit,

405
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:08,651
that guy is a hero.

406
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:15,620
That's everything you asked for.

407
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:18,331
How do you sleep at night,

408
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:21,964
knowing you've destroyed
so many people's lives?

409
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:24,291
I don't.

410
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:29,338
Do you have anyone in your life
that you care about?

411
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:32,223
I have a daughter.

412
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:36,186
I used to have someone in my life
that I cared about.

413
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:39,857
My girlfriend, Jenny.

414
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:45,229
We were gonna get married,
have kids someday.

415
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:53,663
But after I got hit by that wave
from the particle accelerator,

416
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:55,580
all my dreams ended.

417
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:59,497
You know, I see her sometimes,
walking down the street.

418
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:02,538
She doesn't even recognize me.
Why would she?

419
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:05,003
I look as old as her dad.

420
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,418
You robbed me of her.

421
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:12,306
Griffin, stop talking.
So I can concentrate.

422
00:27:12,673 --> 00:27:17,053
Wake up, man.
This city is screwed up because of you.

423
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:20,644
It was quiet and normal,

424
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:23,233
until you rode in on your high horse

425
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:26,236
talking about science
and changing the future.

426
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:27,647
You didn't stop to think

427
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:30,612
about what your particle accelerator
could do to others.

428
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:33,027
You only thought about
what it could do for you!

429
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:34,240
Enough!

430
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:38,369
Enough.

431
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,914
I hope it was worth it, "Doc."

432
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:51,428
Stay away from the wall.

433
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:53,339
Let's give it a whirl.

434
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:21,997
Well, looks like
you have a little badass in you after all.

435
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:30,459
What are we gonna do about this guy?

436
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:34,346
Oh, Caity, I don't think
he's ever going home,

437
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:36,632
and neither are you.

438
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,553
What are you doing?
I thought we had a deal!

439
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,721
Oh!

440
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:45,645
Is everyone on your Earth this gullible?

441
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:57,118
Heels aren't the best on ice, are they?

442
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:02,658
You know, once I saw you,
I realized why Zoom didn't kill me.

443
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,373
Because I lookjust like you.

444
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:08,877
Now, he won't need me anymore.

445
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:27,599
No, I don't.

446
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:37,785
Try that with him, he dies, too.

447
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:45,868
I'm not picking up anything
from facial recognition.

448
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:50,918
The only cellular dead zone
I can find is the one in here. No offense.

449
00:29:52,082 --> 00:29:54,301
No, wait a second, was he wearing
his watch when he left to get me?

450
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,052
I already tried that. GPS isn't working.

451
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:58,760
Okay, no, but the meta-human activity
would be.

452
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:00,549
I mean, the watch is designed
to track metas, right?

453
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:02,138
And since Griffin Gray is one,

454
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:04,395
it'll keep sending a message to a sewer
until it goes through.

455
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:06,897
But since we're on a different Earth,
it'll never go through.

456
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:09,232
So itjust keeps sending the same signal.

457
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:12,853
There he is, Central City Amusement Park.

458
00:30:13,103 --> 00:30:14,730
Yeah, and I'm coming with, this time.

459
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:17,490
Okay, great, we found Harry,
but how are we gonna stop Gray?

460
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,242
I'm so glad you asked.

461
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:22,154
Jesse and I
upgraded the internal lining of the suit.

462
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:25,658
Felicity hooked us up
with some dwarf star alloy.

463
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,417
Wait, dwarf star alloy?

464
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:29,795
It's the same compound
that's used to protect Ray's Atom suit.

465
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:32,422
That's right.
Super strong, super lightweight.

466
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:34,834
Only thing is, we couldn't get much of it.

467
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,047
All right, what does that mean?

468
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:40,589
We could only cover
the chest portion of the suit.

469
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:42,090
- Oh.
- Yeah, sorry.

470
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:44,555
Uh, here's the other thing,
probably not a big deal.

471
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:46,769
Um, I'm guessing the suit will only absorb

472
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:48,521
- one of Gray's punches.
- Hmm!

473
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:51,187
Anything more than that,
you'll be like a pinata,

474
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,852
only it won't be candy coming out.
It'll be...

475
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:54,861
- Me.
- Your... Yeah, you.

476
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,068
Yeah. All right.

477
00:30:58,065 --> 00:30:59,783
Hopefully, one gimme punch
is all I'll need.

478
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,413
All right, then.

479
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:12,954
Finished.

480
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:17,463
This is gonna cure me?

481
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:22,139
As we say in science,
I'm cautiously optimistic.

482
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:28,600
You know, I learned a lot about chemistry
in the past two years.

483
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:30,518
That right?

484
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:33,150
And I know all you've been doing

485
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:36,107
is diluting that compound
for the past half hour.

486
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:39,944
You don't know how to help me, do you?

487
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,486
There is no helping you.

488
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:51,919
I told you you were gonna fix me,
or you were dead!

489
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:17,107
Why is it that bad guys always
insist on having the creepiest hideouts?

490
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:18,441
Because they're crazy.

491
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:20,234
Right.

492
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:25,361
Hey, Barry, Gray's headed your way.

493
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:27,245
All right, come on. Hey, come on.

494
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:34,415
You ready?

495
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:38,215
Okay, Iris. On my mark.

496
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:40,174
Three...

497
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:44,213
Two, one. Now!

498
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:52,270
Is that all you got, Flash?

499
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:53,430
We just want Dr. Wells.

500
00:32:53,597 --> 00:32:56,567
And I wanted him to fix me, but he can't.

501
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:59,319
So once I finish you,
I'm gonna finish him.

502
00:32:59,561 --> 00:33:00,653
Freeze.

503
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:10,993
Come on!

504
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:14,872
You Okay?

505
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:19,755
Come On.

506
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:26,096
Okay, I think, one more punch
and we get this guy a walker.

507
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:28,302
Hey, guys, we got him.
He's over by the Ferris wheel.

508
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:36,314
Look, we can help you.

509
00:33:36,473 --> 00:33:37,599
It's too late for that.

510
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:41,436
Not everyone got the powers
you did, Flash.

511
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:45,031
Some of us weren't so lucky.

512
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:55,033
That was the "gimme."

513
00:33:55,325 --> 00:33:58,750
Griffin, please, stop.

514
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:03,463
I might be getting older,
but I'm stronger than ever.

515
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:18,436
Barry!

516
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:31,032
You Okay?

517
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:32,867
Oh! Yeah, I'm good.

518
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:35,498
Could've used more
of that dwarf star alloy.

519
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:14,780
I'm so sorry.

520
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:18,245
I'm sorry, too.

521
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,476
Oh! Home, sweet home.

522
00:35:40,764 --> 00:35:41,936
Yeah, well.

523
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:45,898
To be honest,
hasn't felt much like a home in a while.

524
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:47,233
At least, certainly not since you left.

525
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:53,285
Yeah. Look, I'm sorry, Dad,
forjust leaving like that.

526
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:55,070
But... I mean.

527
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:59,825
You have to understand.
I'm the reason you killed that man.

528
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:03,912
And that's a really heavy burden to bear.

529
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:08,083
I know.

530
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:14,549
I know. I also know that what I've done,
it's unforgiveable.

531
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,524
When your mother died, honey,

532
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,732
something inside me broke.

533
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:32,282
I couldn't protect her.

534
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:38,452
And I swore, I swore on her grave,
no less, that I would protect you.

535
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:41,082
And then Zoom took you and I snapped.

536
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,952
I just snapped.

537
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:46,000
I couldn't breathe, I...

538
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:52,795
I couldn't lose the only other person
that I love.

539
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:55,513
Yeah, yeah, I get that.

540
00:36:57,090 --> 00:37:00,936
I understand why
you did everything you did to protect me.

541
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,729
I mean, you were only missing one day

542
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:06,141
and I would have done anything
to find you.

543
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:09,478
But... I mean.

544
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:13,820
I need to know that
that's never gonna happen again, okay?

545
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:16,742
Every time I stay out late,
or get in trouble,

546
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:21,039
you can't track me down, or hurt someone
'cause you're trying to save me.

547
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,616
Yeah, but you're in danger.

548
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:24,329
- I know.
- Okay.

549
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:29,623
I will make you a promise.

550
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:37,305
I promise you I will be the kind of father
that you can be proud of,

551
00:37:37,464 --> 00:37:42,015
if you promise me
you will never run away from me again.

552
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:44,854
Okay. Okay, deal.

553
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:48,270
I love you, Dad.

554
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:49,642
I love you too.

555
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:54,531
My little Jesse Quick.

556
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:02,034
Relax, he'll be here.

557
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:06,368
What should I say?
I mean, I don't even know where to start.

558
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:09,378
Just be honest. Speak from your heart.

559
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,001
Okay.

560
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:12,882
Wally West.

561
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:15,627
I'll see you at home.

562
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:18,842
You wanted to see me.

563
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:22,392
Uh, yes. ldid. I mean, I do.

564
00:38:24,177 --> 00:38:26,100
Um...

565
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:29,019
I just wanted to thank you
for saving my life.

566
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:33,938
And I know that
that came at a huge price for you.

567
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:37,403
And I don't know how I'll ever repay that.

568
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:43,037
I guess what I wanted to say was that

569
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,749
I'm not gonna waste this chance
that you've given me.

570
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:49,835
Thank you.

571
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:54,132
You're welcome, Wally.

572
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:15,603
You okay?

573
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:17,780
Stay away from me.

574
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:21,655
Killer Frost tried to kill you, Caitlin.

575
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:24,909
I saved your life.

576
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:27,950
You should thank me.

577
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:29,535
I just wanna go home.

578
00:39:30,118 --> 00:39:32,496
No. Stay.

579
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:37,550
I want to leave!

580
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:39,919
Stay, boy!

581
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:41,129
No!

582
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:47,219
Please, take me back to my Earth.

583
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,272
You know,

584
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:57,070
I've always measured my success by
counting the number of victims I've had.

585
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,448
But now I think I'm gonna widen my scope

586
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:06,363
and start counting the number of Earths
I conquer instead.

587
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:09,323
You wanna go home?

588
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:13,336
Let's go. After all,

589
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:16,043
this Earth has already been
brought to its knees.

590
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,774
Well, you're here early.

591
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:41,360
Yeah, I couldn't sleep.

592
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:42,819
Me, neither.

593
00:40:43,316 --> 00:40:46,911
I know that we just took down Gray
without my powers, but...

594
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:51,457
I have no idea
how to get Caitlin back without them.

595
00:40:52,492 --> 00:40:53,539
We can't, Allen.

596
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:56,162
Then what are we gonna do?

597
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:00,959
Gray...

598
00:41:02,085 --> 00:41:04,884
Gray kidnapped me

599
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:10,264
because he thought I was Harrison Wells
from this Earth.

600
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:13,521
I know he was talking about another guy,
but I just...

601
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:20,062
I can't help but think.
I still haven't paid for what I've done.

602
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:22,397
What does that mean?

603
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:32,575
I thought, you know, when you...
When we closed the breaches,

604
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:36,415
I could just forget
about everything I've done, but I can't.

605
00:41:38,788 --> 00:41:41,667
I realize what I can do.

606
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:48,886
You are gonna get your speed back, Allen.
And I'm gonna help you do that.

607
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:52,093
How?

608
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:57,895
By creating
another particle accelerator explosion.

609
00:41:57,919 --> 00:42:05,919
