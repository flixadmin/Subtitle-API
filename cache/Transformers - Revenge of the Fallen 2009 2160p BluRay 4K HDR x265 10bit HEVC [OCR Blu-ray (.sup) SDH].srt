like you thought they would?

303
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:06,992
<i>Director Galloway,
our National Security Advisor.</i>

304
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:10,037
<i>The Presidentjust appointed him liaison.</i>

305
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,706
Well , I guess I didn't get that memo.

306
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:17,794
GALLOWAY: Forgive the interruption ,
General . Excuse me. Coming through .

307
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,255
Excuse me. Excuse me, soldier.

308
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:23,550
After all the damage in Shanghai ,

309
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:27,596
the President is hard-pressed
to say the job's getting done.

310
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:33,894
Now, under the classified Alien/Autobot
Cooperation Act,

311
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:39,525
you agreed to share your intel with us,
but not your advancements in weaponry.

312
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:43,529
We've witnessed
your human capacity for war.

313
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:47,199
It would absolutely bring
more harm than good .

314
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:50,160
But who are you to judge
what's best for us?

315
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:52,287
With all due respect,
we've been fighting side by side

316
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,914
in the field for two years.

317
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:57,292
We've shed blood ,
sweat and precious metal together.

318
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:00,087
Soldier, you're paid to shoot, not talk.

319
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,797
Don't tempt me.

320
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,383
GALLOWAY: And the newest members
of your team .

321
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:05,425
OPTIMUS: Easy.

322
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:06,760
GALLOWAY: I understand
they arrived here

323
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:08,720
after you sent a message into space,

324
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:12,558
an open invitation to come to Earth ,
vetted by no one at the White House.

325
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:16,395
Let me stop you right there,
Mr. Galloway. It was vetted right here.

326
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:20,399
<i>And in my experience, the judgment
of both Major Lennox and his team</i>

327
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:23,402
has always been above reproach .

328
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:26,321
<i>Well, be that as it may, General,
it is the position of the President</i>

329
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:31,952
<i>that when our national security is
at stake, no one is above reproach.</i>

330
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:35,163
Now, what do we know so far?

331
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:41,670
We know that the enemy leader,
classified N BE One, aka Megatron ,

332
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:45,340
<i>is rusting in peace at the bottom
of the Laurentian Abyssal,</i>

333
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:49,928
<i>surrounded by SOSUS detection nets
and a full-time submarine surveillance.</i>

334
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:54,433
We also know that the only remaining
piece of your alien AllSpark

335
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,435
<i>is locked in an electromagnetic vault</i>

336
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:59,855
<i>here on one of the most secure
naval bases in the world.</i>

337
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:04,443
SOU N DWAVE: Decepticons,
we have located the shard .

338
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:10,365
And since no one can seem to tell me
what the enemy is now after,

339
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:13,285
well , there's only one clear conclusion !

340
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:16,204
You ! The Autobots !

341
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,333
They're here to hunt you !

342
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:22,377
What's there to hunt for on Earth
besides that?

343
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:25,339
"The Fallen shall rise again"?

344
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,633
It sounds to me
like something's coming .

345
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:32,471
So, let me ask, if we ultimately conclude
that our national security is best served

346
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:36,266
by denying you further asylum
on our planet,

347
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:41,271
will you leave peacefully?

348
00:24:41,355 --> 00:24:46,234
Freedom is your right. If you make
that request, we will honor it.

349
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:52,574
But before your President decides,
please ask him this.

350
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:57,537
What if we leave and you're wrong?

351
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:07,089
That's a good question .

352
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:09,257

-Yeah , smells like $40, 000 a year.

So, I already set up the crib a bit.
You want this side or that side?

00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:49,381
-That side.
-I already chose that side.

363

You know what this is?
This is the awkward moment.

Yeah , see,
you're trying to see if I'm a normal guy.

I'm trying to see if you're a normal guy.

Balanced , unmedicated ,

wrecked and China says "gas leak."

Don't believe the hype, bro.

in LA two years ago

that everyone covered up.

394

Yeah , I saw these robots,
and they did this, like, firing thing

395
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:03,288
and they came down and toasted
this woman , and she was like...

-It looks fake to me.

Anybody could do it
on any computer, okay?

00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:17,219
And I wasn't there,

402

-so I can't comment or speculate.
-No.

Don't be sucking the sack, bro !

01:14:33,093 --> 01:14:36,138
They gotta mean something ,
like a message or like a map.

1057
01:14:36,221 --> 01:14:37,640
Like a map to an Energon source !

1058
01:14:37,723 --> 01:14:40,976
-Can you read this?
-Read?

1059
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:43,354
No. We don't really do much reading .
Not so much .

1060
01:14:43,437 --> 01:14:45,481
If you can't read it,
we gotta find somebody who can .

1061
01:14:45,564 --> 01:14:47,191
Look who came sashaying back!

1062
01:14:47,274 --> 01:14:48,859
Hair growing like a Chia Pet.
Look at him .

1063
01:14:48,942 --> 01:14:50,778
I had a bit
of a mild panic attack earlier, right?

1064
01:14:50,861 --> 01:14:51,987
That's 'cause you're a pussy.

1065
01:14:52,071 --> 01:14:53,947
I think I'm allowed that,
considering what I've been through .

1066
01:14:54,573 --> 01:14:55,658
I heard you have a problem .

1067
01:14:55,741 --> 01:14:58,744
-I think I know someone who can help.
-Who?

1068
01:14:58,827 --> 01:14:59,995
Robo-Warrior.

1069
01:15:03,582 --> 01:15:04,792
LEO: This guy, Robo-Warrior,

1070
01:15:04,875 --> 01:15:07,252
everything about anything alien ,
he's supposed to know.

1071
01:15:07,378 --> 01:15:08,712
One time we revenge-hacked his site

1072
01:15:08,796 --> 01:15:13,217
and maybe I saw some
of your alien drawings or whatever.

1073
01:15:25,771 --> 01:15:27,606
This is it. Yep.

1074
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:28,857
Deli . Good front!

1075
01:15:29,274 --> 01:15:31,777
All right, wait here.
I'll give you the go/no go. All right?

1076
01:15:32,277 --> 01:15:34,947
N umber 42, we got your kishka, knish ,

1077
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:38,158
kasha-varnishka
and kreplach combo right here.

1078
01:15:38,242 --> 01:15:39,576
Cash only. Who's next?

1079
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:42,955
I told you to cure the lox in the brine
and then smoke it.

1080
01:15:43,038 --> 01:15:44,623
Ma, you want me
to cut my hand off, or what?

1081
01:15:44,707 --> 01:15:46,208
You . . . You ruined
a beautiful piece of fish , you retard !

1082
01:15:46,291 --> 01:15:47,626
I'm like a ninja with a blade.
It's an art form .

1083
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:48,919
Give me your money. Get out of here !

1084
01:15:49,002 --> 01:15:52,923
Hey, Sal ! Watch your reach , huh?
Take a number, young man .

1085
01:15:53,507 --> 01:15:54,925
Robo-Warrior.

1086
01:15:56,635 --> 01:15:58,804
-Know him?
-I never heard of him .

1087
01:15:58,887 --> 01:16:01,223
You never heard of
TheReal Effing Deal .com?

1088
01:16:01,306 --> 01:16:03,851
You must be talking about that
amateur-hour blog operation

1089
01:16:03,934 --> 01:16:07,062
-with Game Boy-level security.
-Robo-Warrior.

1090
01:16:08,188 --> 01:16:11,024
It's him ! It's him !
That's the guy right there ! That's him !

1091
01:16:12,276 --> 01:16:13,527
No.

1092
01:16:14,194 --> 01:16:16,405
-You got to be kidding me.
-All right, meat store's closed !

1093
01:16:16,488 --> 01:16:18,866
-Everybody out! Out, right now!
-WOMAN : When he says to go,

1094
01:16:18,949 --> 01:16:20,534
-you go.
-That means you , lady, right now.

1095
01:16:20,617 --> 01:16:22,745
-Wait a minute. You know this guy?
-We're old friends.

1096
01:16:22,828 --> 01:16:26,290
Old friends? You're the case
that shut down Sector Seven ,

1097
01:16:26,373 --> 01:16:27,708
got the kibosh , disbanded .

1098
01:16:27,791 --> 01:16:31,044
No more security clearance,
no retirement, no nothing .

1099
01:16:31,128 --> 01:16:34,089
All 'cause of you
and your little criminal girlfriend .

1100
01:16:34,173 --> 01:16:38,469
-Look at her now, so mature.
-Moron ! Where's the whitefish?

1101
01:16:38,552 --> 01:16:40,429
Hey! Don't touch me with the pig .

1102
01:16:40,512 --> 01:16:42,097
-SIMMONS: Yakov!
-What?

1103
01:16:42,181 --> 01:16:44,224
You don't get
Christmas bonuses standing around !

1104
01:16:44,308 --> 01:16:46,101
You want those new teeth
you saw on SkyMall?

1105
01:16:46,185 --> 01:16:48,395
-It's my dream .
-Help her out.

1106
01:16:49,021 --> 01:16:50,063
You live with your mama?

1107
01:16:50,147 --> 01:16:51,482
No, my mama lives with me.
It's a big difference.

1108
01:16:51,565 --> 01:16:53,442
They got your face all over the news,
alien boy.

1109
01:16:53,525 --> 01:16:55,903
-Yeah , I know.
-And N BE One's still kicking , huh?

1110
01:16:55,986 --> 01:16:58,155
How did that happen? Don't answer.

1111
01:16:58,238 --> 01:17:00,616
I don't know what you're hiding ,
but I don't want anything to do with it.

1112
01:17:00,699 --> 01:17:03,452
So, good-bye. You never saw me.
I got bagels to schmear. Vanish .

1113
01:17:03,535 --> 01:17:05,996
Can you give me five seconds?
Look, hold on , I need your help.

1114
01:17:06,079 --> 01:17:08,665
Really? You need my help?

1115
01:17:08,749 --> 01:17:11,376
I need . . .
Look, I am slowly losing my mind .

1116
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:13,086
Okay, I had a little crab-bot,

1117
01:17:13,170 --> 01:17:15,297
plunged a device deep into
the soft tissues of my brain

1118
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:18,217
and started projecting little alien
symbols like a freaking home movie !

1119
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:21,053
And on top of that, I'm a wanted fugitive.
So, you think you got it rough?

1120
01:17:21,136 --> 01:17:23,305
You said it projected images
off your brain?

1121
01:17:23,388 --> 01:17:25,974
-Right.
-Meat locker, now!

1122
01:17:26,725 --> 01:17:27,976
LEO: Dead pigs.
MI KAELA: Yuck.

1123
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:30,229
What you're about to see is top secret.

1124
01:17:30,979 --> 01:17:33,023
Do not tell my mother.

1125
01:17:34,149 --> 01:17:36,151
LEO: Swine flu . Not good .
SIMMONS: Now you know.

1126
01:17:36,235 --> 01:17:39,196
Next time you eat a goat or a pig ,
there's a story behind it.

1127
01:17:39,279 --> 01:17:40,572
Sad little story.

1128
01:17:40,656 --> 01:17:41,824
<i>MAN ON TV: An entire city flat.
How do you explain that?</i>

1129
01:17:41,907 --> 01:17:42,991
<i>Are you saying you believe
in aliens now?</i>

1130
01:17:43,075 --> 01:17:46,245
SIMMONS: Okay, files, files.
We're talking about symbols.

1131
01:17:46,912 --> 01:17:49,540
Hey, still radioactive. Hands off.

1132
01:17:50,332 --> 01:17:52,251
Okay, Cube-brain .

1133
01:17:52,876 --> 01:17:55,087
Any of these look
like the symbols you saw?

1134
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:56,505
Where'd you get these?

1135
01:17:56,588 --> 01:18:00,259
Before I got fired ,
I poached S-7's crown jewel ,

1136
01:18:00,342 --> 01:18:05,722
over 75 years of alien research ,
which points to one inescapable fact.

1137
01:18:05,806 --> 01:18:09,768
The Transformers,
they've been here a long , long time.

1138
01:18:10,143 --> 01:18:11,270
How do I know?

1139
01:18:12,437 --> 01:18:14,273
Archeologists found
these unexplained markings

1140
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:16,608
in ancient ruins all over the world .

1141
01:18:17,025 --> 01:18:19,111
China. Egypt. Greece.

1142
01:18:20,070 --> 01:18:21,655
Shot in 1 932.

1143
01:18:21,738 --> 01:18:23,574
These the symbols
you're seeing in your head?

1144
01:18:23,657 --> 01:18:26,243
-Yeah .
-Same ones over here, right?

1145
01:18:26,326 --> 01:18:31,123
So, tell me, how did they end up
all drawing the same things?

1146
01:18:32,124 --> 01:18:35,127
Aliens. And I think some of them stayed .

1147
01:18:35,210 --> 01:18:38,130
Check this out. Project Black Knife.

1148
01:18:38,630 --> 01:18:43,093
Robots in disguise,
hiding here all along .

1149
01:18:43,176 --> 01:18:46,471
We detected radioactive signatures
all across the country.

1150
01:18:46,555 --> 01:18:50,058
I pleaded on my knees with S-7
to investigate it,

1151
01:18:50,142 --> 01:18:53,687
but they said the readings
were infinitesimal ,

1152
01:18:53,770 --> 01:18:56,231
that I was obsessed .

1153
01:18:56,315 --> 01:18:58,066
Me. Can you imagine that?

1154
01:18:58,150 --> 01:19:01,278
Yeah . Megatron said that there
was another Energon source here.

1155
01:19:01,361 --> 01:19:03,238
-On Earth . Another source?
-On Earth .

1156
01:19:03,322 --> 01:19:06,199
Okay? And that these symbols,
maps in my head , would lead him there.

1157
01:19:06,283 --> 01:19:08,035
You talk to your Autobot friends
about this?

1158
01:19:08,118 --> 01:19:09,411
No, no, no, the source is before them .

1159
01:19:09,494 --> 01:19:11,330
Whatever the Energon source is,
it predates them .

1160
01:19:11,413 --> 01:19:12,497
It's before them .

1161
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:14,583
-So, it comes before them .
-Correct.

1162
01:19:14,666 --> 01:19:18,045
Well , then we're porked ,
unless we can talk to a Decepticon .

1163
01:19:18,378 --> 01:19:20,213
I mean ,
I'm not on speaking terms with them .

1164
01:19:20,297 --> 01:19:22,007
Actually, I am .

1165
01:19:26,678 --> 01:19:28,055
WH EELI E: Let me out!

1166
01:19:28,138 --> 01:19:30,390
-This is going to be a little bit sad .
-Open it.

1167
01:19:30,599 --> 01:19:31,934
(EXCLAIMI NG)

1168
01:19:32,017 --> 01:19:34,227
I will have so many Decepticons
on your butt!

1169
01:19:34,311 --> 01:19:35,771
Hey, behave !

1170
01:19:35,854 --> 01:19:37,689
-What is it, a Decepticon?
-Yeah .

1171
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:39,566
-And you're training him?
-I'm trying to.

1172
01:19:40,233 --> 01:19:43,153
I spent my whole adult life combing
the planet for aliens,

1173
01:19:43,445 --> 01:19:46,573
and you're carrying around one
in your purse like a little Chihuahua.

1174
01:19:47,157 --> 01:19:49,618
Do you want a throwdown ,
you pubic 'fro-head?

1175
01:19:49,701 --> 01:19:52,871
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry about your eye, you know,

1176
01:19:52,955 --> 01:19:56,083
but, if you're a good boy,
then I'm not gonna torch your other eye.

1177
01:19:56,166 --> 01:19:57,584
Okay? I'm not gonna torch it.

1178
01:19:57,668 --> 01:20:01,046
J ust tell me
what these symbols are, please.

1179
01:20:02,339 --> 01:20:03,548
All right.

1180
01:20:04,967 --> 01:20:07,594
I know that.
That's the language of the Primes.

1181
01:20:08,512 --> 01:20:11,181
I don't read it, but these guys...

1182
01:20:11,264 --> 01:20:13,767
Where the frick did you find photos
of these guys?

1183
01:20:13,850 --> 01:20:17,646
-Is this they?
-Yeah . Seekers, pal . Oldest of the old .

1184
01:20:18,063 --> 01:20:21,316
They've been here thousands of years,
looking for something . I don't know what.

1185
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:24,903
Nobody tells me nothing , but they'll
translate those symbols for you .

1186
01:20:24,987 --> 01:20:27,322
-And I know where to find them .
-Show us.

1187
01:20:27,406 --> 01:20:28,740
Yeah .

1188

SIMMONS: The closest one's
in Washington .

Smithsonian Air and Space Museum .
Land of dreams in there.

1190
01:20:42,587 --> 01:20:44,506
All I ever wanted to be was an astronaut.

1191
01:20:46,466 --> 01:20:48,552
-SIMMONS: Hold those.
-What is that?

1192
01:20:49,428 --> 01:20:51,596
What? I wear them when I'm in a funk.

1193
01:20:52,597 --> 01:20:56,143
So does Giambi , Jeter.
It's a baseball thing . Okay.

1194
01:20:56,226 --> 01:20:57,686
Watches synchronized ,
sharp mind and empty bladder.

1195
01:20:58,687 --> 01:21:01,690
You get caught, demand an attorney
and don't ever say my name.

1196
01:21:01,773 --> 01:21:03,525
Okay, take one of these pills.
Slip it under your tongue.

1197
01:21:03,608 --> 01:21:05,902
It's the high-concentrate polymer
they put in Oreo cookies.

1198
01:21:05,986 --> 01:21:07,696
Tricks the polygraph every time.

Whoa. Whoa !
No, listen , I can't do this.

1202
01:21:12,159 --> 01:21:14,077

by turning on that machine.</i>

1350
01:29:49,968 --> 01:29:54,013
<i>The only way to activate it
is with a legendary key</i>

1351
01:29:54,097 --> 01:29:57,183
<i>called the Matrix of Leadership.</i>

1352
01:30:03,481 --> 01:30:07,860
<i>A great battle took place over
possession of the Matrix.</i>

1353
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:15,159
<i>The Fallen was stronger than
his brothers,</i>

1354
01:30:16,536 --> 01:30:20,999
<i>so they had no choice
but to steal and hide it from him.</i>

1355
01:30:21,624 --> 01:30:26,462
<i>In the ultimate sacrifice, they gave
their lives to seal the Matrix away</i>

1356
01:30:26,546 --> 01:30:29,716
<i>in a tomb made of
their very own bodies,</i>

1357
01:30:30,466 --> 01:30:33,344
<i>a tomb we cannot find.</i>

1358
01:30:34,804 --> 01:30:40,476
Somewhere, buried in this desert,
that deadly machine remains.

1359
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:42,604
The Fallen knows where it is

1360
01:30:42,687 --> 01:30:48,318
and if he finds the tomb of the Primes,
your world will be no more.

1361
01:30:48,693 --> 01:30:50,320
Okay, so how do we stop him?

1362
01:30:50,403 --> 01:30:52,780
Only a Prime can defeat The Fallen .

1363
01:30:52,864 --> 01:30:54,449
Optimus Prime?

1364
01:30:56,868 --> 01:30:58,995
So, you've met a Prime?

1365
01:30:59,078 --> 01:31:02,165
Why, you must have met
a great descendant.

1366
01:31:02,248 --> 01:31:05,376
Is he alive, here on this planet?

1367
01:31:06,085 --> 01:31:08,379
He sacrificed himself to save me.

1368
01:31:08,838 --> 01:31:10,298
So, he's dead .

1369
01:31:10,381 --> 01:31:14,469
Without a Prime, it's impossible.
No one else could stop The Fallen .

1370
01:31:14,552 --> 01:31:18,556
So, the same energy that's gonna be
used to reactivate the machine,

1371
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:21,267
could that energy somehow be used
to reactivate Optimus

1372
01:31:21,351 --> 01:31:22,393
and bring him back to life?

1373
01:31:22,477 --> 01:31:27,190
It was never designed for that purpose,
but it's an energy like no other.

1374
01:31:27,482 --> 01:31:31,152
So, then how do you get us to the Matrix
before the Decepticons get to me?

1375
01:31:31,235 --> 01:31:34,447
Follow your mind , your map,
your symbols.

1376

What you carved in the sand ,
it's your clue.

1377
01:31:37,241 --> 01:31:42,455
When dawn alights the Dagger's Tip,
Three Kings will reveal the doorway!

1378
01:31:42,538 --> 01:31:44,499

Okay, here's what my CIA contact says.

1383
01:32:01,766 --> 01:32:05,311
Ancient Sumerians used to call
the Gulf of Aqaba the "Dagger's Tip."

1384
01:32:05,395 --> 01:32:07,271
-That's the Dagger's Tip.
-It's part of the Red Sea.

1385
01:32:07,355 --> 01:32:09,524
It divides Egypt and Jordan
like the tip of a blade.

1386
01:32:09,607 --> 01:32:13,444
29. 5 degrees north , 35 east. Here it is.

1387
01:32:13,945 --> 01:32:15,905
First thing we've got to do
is get Optimus to the Dagger's Tip.

1388
01:32:15,988 --> 01:32:18,449
How are you gonna get him
halfway around the world?

a thing worth doing until now.

Not to call you a coward , Master,

1971
02:20:39,806 --> 02:20:45,478
but sometimes cowards do survive.

1972

This isn't over.

1973
02:21:15,717 --> 02:21:18,595
It took all this for you to tell me that
you love me.

1974
02:21:20,221 --> 02:21:21,765
You said it first.
