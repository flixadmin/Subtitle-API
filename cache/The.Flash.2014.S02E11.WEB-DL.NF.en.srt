what's right in front of us,</i>

running is all I've been doing.</i>

00:00:15,848 --> 00:00:18,643
You've been playing Good Samaritan
all morning. Take a break.

7
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:22,021
Are you sure you don't wanna
get to CCPD, give Patty your attention?

No, I can see her later.

sipping Mai Tais since you got here?

I don't know what you've been sipping

better, stronger, faster.

13
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:33,741
We need to train to prepare for Zoom.

14

Oh, I see.
You haven't had your coffee this morning.

15
00:00:36,994 --> 00:00:38,413
I had my coffee this morning.
Don't slurp.

Yes!

That one was a little close.

00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:56,073
Nice.
Now can you please, please take a break?

-How's that for training?
-Great.

Look, we're gonna catch Zoom.

35
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:03,290
We got Turtle locked up in the pipeline.

36
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:06,293
All we gotta do is use him to figure out
how to steal Zoom's speed,

37
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,336
and then we'll get your daughter back.

00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,630
That might take longer than we thought.

39
00:02:10,963 --> 00:02:11,964
Why is that?

40
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:13,925
Because Turtle's dead.

41
00:02:16,969 --> 00:02:19,139
Barry, we need you back here. Stat.

42

How's that for timing?

You think I did this, Garrick?

55

The key to me saving my daughter.

{\an8}Why would I want that?

57

{\an8}<i>We need to start thinking outside the box.</i>

62

{\an8}I mean, we haven't even figured out
how to close the breaches yet.

63
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,701
{\an8}Maybe that's where we should start.

64
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,496
{\an8}That's a good idea. I'll get on that.

What if we can figure out
how to control my powers?

I need your help, Harry.

110
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,851
What you need, Ramon,
is to figure out what triggers your vibes.

111
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,686
Exactly.
And I don't know what triggers them,

112
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:54,854
it's completely inconsistent.

113
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,064
Sometimes it's when I touch something
that belongs to a breacher,

sometimes it just happens.

115

There's always a cause. Cause. Effect.
Doesn't take Einstein to figure that out.

Okay, so what is the cause?

when I tried to vibe you.

157
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:39,351
Not necessarily.

158
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:42,104
It is possible
Eobard was in the Speed Force,

159
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:46,526
protecting him like a bomb shelter,
keeping him alive and his timeline intact.

160
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,485
It's what's known as a "timeline remnant."

161
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:49,946
A... A what now?

162
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:52,532
Here. Let me show you.

163
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:58,037
This, this is now.

164
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,289
Here. Today.

165
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,209
This is the time Thawne comes from.

166
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:07,880
This is the moment
you all erased him from existence,

167
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:13,302
but since Thawne is from the future,
this is where his timeline begins.

168
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:14,846
That's why he's still alive.

169
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:18,515
This Thawne has not yet traveled
back in time to kill Barry's mother,

170
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,893
he's here, now,
in this time period, for the first time,

171
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:22,186
timeline remnant.

172
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,730
Explains why nothing's changed.

173
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,023
Yeah, it also explains
why he didn't know my name,

174
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:28,317
or that we have met before.

175
00:09:28,525 --> 00:09:30,236
To him, you hadn't. Not until the future.

176
00:09:30,402 --> 00:09:33,906
If Thawne dies
before he can time travel again,

177
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,742
will that save Barry's mother?

178
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,744
No. That's not how it works.

179
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,204
In her timeline,
Barry's mother's already dead,

180
00:09:40,412 --> 00:09:42,749
and her death is a fixed point.
Nothing can change that.

181
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:46,711
All right, well, I'm gonna end this.
Him. In this time, once and for all.

182
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,922
Let's find Dr. McGee, then we'll
figure out what to do about Thawne.

183
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,257
Okay?

184
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,384
I gotta go check on Iris.

185
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,096
Ramon.

186
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,602
Caitlin, I know you're worried
about Dr. McGee,

187
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,061
but we're gonna get her back.

188
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,272
It's not that. It's Jay.

189
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,608
-What about Jay?
-He's sick.

190
00:10:09,441 --> 00:10:10,777
And it's getting worse.

191
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:15,615
When Zoom stole his speed,
it affected him on a cellular level.

192
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,909
We need to do something about it.

193
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,285
All right. Like what?

194
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:23,039
I think we should replace
his dying cells with healthy ones,

195
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:24,456
indistinguishable from his.

196
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,626
How do we do that?

197
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:29,045
We find his Earth-1 doppelganger.

198
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,131
There.

199
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,133
Tachyons?

200
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:39,388
A man in a yellow suit tried to
steal another tachyon prototype last year.

201
00:10:39,596 --> 00:10:40,807
(CHUCKLES)

202
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,558
I must have gotten stuck here once before

203
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:45,144
and not been able
to access enough of the Speed Force.

204
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,479
Tachyons should do it.

205
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,650
I want you to isolate and accelerate
their energetic properties for me.

206
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,151
I don't know if I can do that.

207
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:02,328
If you want to stay alive, learn.

208
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:13,840
Franny...

209
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:16,008
Hey. (EXHALES)

210
00:11:16,508 --> 00:11:17,509
How you feeling today?

211
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:19,846
Better now.

212
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,351
I'm gonna let you two talk, okay?

213
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:26,769
Okay.

214
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:32,316
(SOFTLY) Hey.

215
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:36,863
Can I get you anything?

216
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,866
Oh, just that brother of yours,

217
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,701
so all of us
can be together for the first time.

218
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:45,955
Yeah, he should be here.

219
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,207
Well, his mother's leaving him.

220
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:52,294
Can't blame him
for being angry about that.

221
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:56,673
I just wish he'd get all that anger out
while I'm here to help.

222
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,386
Same thing goes for you, Iris.

223
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:06,851
One thing you learn when you're dying
is not to hold anything back.

224
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:14,566
You want to say something to me,
you need to say it while you can.

225
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,662
I have so many great memories
from when I grew up.

226
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:31,708
Now, when I think about those memories,
I can only wonder

227
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:34,420
what it would've been like
if you and Wally would've been there.

228
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:40,092
I'm not angry at you anymore
for what happened.

229
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:45,556
I just wish
you would've come back to us a lot sooner,

230
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,855
because I would have forgiven you then,
just like I'm forgiving you now.

231
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:55,607
Mmm...

232
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:56,859
Thank you.

233
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,110
Thank you.

234
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,126
(CRYING)

235
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:18,630
I don't know why this is so hard.
I barely even know her.

236
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:28,432
The facial recognition software
at S.T.A.R. Labs

237
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,808
didn't find anything either.

238
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,894
No, but there's still
more databases to check.

239
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:33,312
We'll find his doppelganger.

240
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:34,480
-Thanks, Barry.
-Yeah.

241
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:35,731
PATTY: <i>Hey.</i>

242
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,316
Hi, Caitlin.

243
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:38,650
Hi.

244
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,819
Uh, can we talk?

245
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,571
Uh, yeah. Yeah, for sure.

246
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:44,656
Um, I'll let you know what I find.

247
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,075
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

248
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:47,826
What's up?

249
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,580
I didn't know you were
working with S.T.A.R. Labs.

250
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:58,129
Yeah... Um, yeah, Joe and I
help out every once in a while.

251
00:13:58,837 --> 00:13:59,838
Really?

252
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:03,675
Yeah, I probably shouldn't tell you this,
but there's a lot of weird stuff

253
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:05,177
that happens over there. (CHUCKLES)

254
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:07,346
(CHUCKLES)

255
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,682
Is that what you came to tell me?

256
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:13,644
Um...

257
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:19,275
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) You're just rolling
with the whole me-leaving thing.

258
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:22,694
Yeah, I mean...
I don't know what to tell you, Patty.

259
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:26,698
Everyone in my life that I love
leaves at some point.

260
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:28,325
Kind of getting used to it.

261
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:32,663
You never told me you love me.

262
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,708
Yeah. I guess I don't get that chance now.

263
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:41,713
I don't understand. What is it?
What's going on with you?

264
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,382
Why are you being like this?

265
00:14:43,715 --> 00:14:47,553
My life... It's complicated.
And I don't want you to have regrets.

266
00:14:47,719 --> 00:14:52,058
I don't want you to miss out on something
that you've always wanted to do, and...

267
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:57,688
I wish that things were different
for both of us.

268
00:14:59,731 --> 00:15:02,902
You know, but they're not. Sorry.

269
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:07,489
Me, too.

270
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,381
So, what did you do to my goggles?

271
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:29,595
I added a wavelength trigger to stimulate
the fear receptors in your brain.

272
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:33,349
And then, I took what you already had
to induce slow-wave sleep,

273
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:35,935
upgraded it to get you
to stage four sleep.

274
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,270
Now, this is good,
this will gives us more control.

275
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,521
-Okay.
-Now,

276
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,107
I'll be able to dictate
how long you vibe for.

277
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,192
Put 'em on.

278
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:44,693
What am I gonna see?

279
00:15:44,901 --> 00:15:46,778
I don't know. I've never done this before.

280
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:49,365
You'll have to tell me
so I can steer you where you need to be.

281
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:56,455
Ramon, if you want to find Reverse-Flash,
put on the goggles.

282
00:15:58,707 --> 00:15:59,708
Okay.

283
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:01,127
Atta boy.

284
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:04,546
(SIGHS)

285
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:06,966
Go ahead.

286
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:19,811
(LAUGHS) Oh, yeah, man.
I'm in full-on vibe mode right now.

287
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:21,230
What do you see?

288
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,481
It's hard to explain.

289
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:25,651
It's different events,
different events in time.

290
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,487
Concentrate on the Reverse-Flash.

291
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:29,738
Okay.

292
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,243
I see him.

293
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:36,037
Move toward him.

294
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,417
Okay. Now what?

295
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:44,753
Try to picture him with Christina McGee.

296
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,049
Where the hell am I?

297
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,718
It's charged. You can go now.

298
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,720
You said you'd release me.

299
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:57,016
Yes, I did, didn't I?

300
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,977
No!

301
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,149
(PANTING)

302
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,569
Well, what is it?

303
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:10,404
She's dead.

304
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:15,992
Dr. McGee is dead?

305
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:21,957
Harry and I were trying to hone my powers
to find Zoom.

306
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,668
And then we ended up
using them finding the Reverse-Flash,

307
00:17:24,876 --> 00:17:27,254
and that's when I saw him kill her.

308
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:29,090
And then he left.

309
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,133
He left? What do you mean, he left?

310
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,844
McGee built him
some kind of speed machine,

311
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,305
and he ran into it
and got flung back to the future.

312
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:37,514
(SIGHS)

313
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:40,392
Well, you'd need superluminal energy
to send someone through time.

314
00:17:40,767 --> 00:17:42,061
-You mean like tachyons?
-Tachyons.

315
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:46,190
Wait, we can track their location
once they've been activated.

316
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:51,570
-Anything?
-Nothing.

317
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:53,405
Cisco, you're sure that's what you saw?

318
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:55,199
-I'm positive.
-All right.

319
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:56,658
What else did you see?

320
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:59,286
There was all sorts of
weird tech everywhere. There was a clock.

321
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,037
What time did the clock say?

322
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:06,085
9:52, I think. How is that relevant?

323
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:07,461
It's 6:00 now.

324
00:18:10,046 --> 00:18:11,715
Are you telling me I can see the future?

325
00:18:11,923 --> 00:18:13,008
That's exactly what I'm telling you.

326
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,760
Those goggles are getting named.
Immediately.

327
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:16,553
But that means Dr. McGee's alive.

328
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:17,846
That's right.

329
00:18:18,054 --> 00:18:20,182
Yeah, okay. We have three hours,
52 minutes to find her

330
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:22,184

Can't get enough of those case files?

334
00:18:30,066 --> 00:18:32,027
Ah, just following up on a hunch.

335
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:33,654
You're gonna miss the action, right?

336
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:35,947
Maybe. A little.

337
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:38,742
I'm gonna miss you.

338
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,161
I'll miss you, too.

339
00:18:40,952 --> 00:18:42,371
It's nice to know someone will.

340
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:45,499
Wait, are we talking about Barry? 'Cause
it sounds like we're talking about Barry.

341
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:48,460
He kept telling me there was stuff
he couldn't share with me,

342
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:52,047
and I've been going a little crazy
trying to figure out what that stuff is.

343
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:55,134
Yeah. Barry's not great at sharing.

344
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:57,428
Neither are you.

345
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:58,637
What do you mean?

346
00:18:58,845 --> 00:19:00,139
Barry just told me that, you know,

347
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:03,975
sometimes he helps you out
with S.T.A.R. Labs stuff.

348
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,478
Yeah, he does,
when he has a few extra minutes.

349
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,980
I didn't know that. I mean,
the whole time I've been working here,

350
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,774
you never mentioned it to me.

351
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:14,195
But then I realized why.

352
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,448
I went through some of Barry's old cases.

353
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:21,243
All of them involved The Flash
saving the day,

354
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:25,831
with details that Barry
couldn't have possibly even known.

355
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:27,082
That's weird.

356
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:31,712
Yeah, it... It is weird.

357
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:36,383
The only thing that does make sense
is that Barry is The Flash.

358
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:39,178
Have you ever seen Barry run?

359
00:19:39,886 --> 00:19:41,680
He waddles. Like a slow-ass duck.

360
00:19:41,888 --> 00:19:43,390
There's no way he's The Flash, Patty.

361
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:44,766
You know, when I started this job,

362
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:47,353
you told me
I had to learn how to lie to do it.

363
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,521
You're a terrible liar, Joe.

364
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,275
See you.

365
00:20:01,908 --> 00:20:03,410
Nice nitrous kit.

366
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,912
You're gonna get caught one of these days,
you know that, right?

367
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:07,122
Get thrown in jail?

368
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:10,751
I'll stop racing
when these hospital bills stop coming in.

369
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:14,296
I saw Mom today.
She says you haven't been by in a while.

370
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:15,464
Yeah. She knows why.

371
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:17,341
She thinks it's because
you're angry with her.

372
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:21,220
I have every right to be angry.
Nothing for 20 years.

373
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:23,930
Then out of nowhere, she tells me
I have a sister. I have a father.

374
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:26,433
Yeah, the same thing
happened to me, too, remember?

375
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:29,520
But that shouldn't keep you
from seeing her before you can't anymore.

376
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,439
No, look, that's not what it is.

377
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:33,899
Then what is it, Wally?

378
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:35,609
I gotta go.

379
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:39,946
Last year, my fiancé died.

380
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:42,866
Unexpectedly.

381
00:20:44,951 --> 00:20:48,622
One moment he was here, the next, gone.

382
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:52,042
I didn't get a chance
to say goodbye to him,

383
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:54,420
to tell him everything
that he meant to me,

384
00:20:55,086 --> 00:20:56,129
that he was my world,

385
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,007
that he was loved.

386
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:04,220
But today, I got to say goodbye
to your mom. My mom.

387
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:08,642
And it helped us both find peace
with what happened to our family.

388
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:12,313
Wally, don't make a mistake
you're gonna regret the rest of your life.

389
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:15,482
Go, see your mom, while you still can.

about Jay's doppelganger?

396
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,676
There's no Jay Garrick on this earth.

397

Maybe just ask Jay. He's a good guy.

-She caught me off guard,

I mean, I played it off,
but, come on, she's a smart girl.

406
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:09,495
And, she was going through some case
files, and you were acting all squirrelly.

00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,194
and not do something about it.

471
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:13,446
I tried to find your doppelganger.

472
00:26:13,864 --> 00:26:16,282
Same DNA, same cellular structure.

473
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:20,370
I could replace your dying cells
with his living ones.

474
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:26,542
But you don't have
a doppelganger on this earth.

475
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:29,129
Caitlin, there is a good explanation.

476
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:32,132
Meet me at Hofherr Park tomorrow,
and I'll show you.

477
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,383
Why can't you just tell me?

478
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:35,260
Because you need to see for yourself.

479
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,314
(SIGHS)

480
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:50,651
How'd you get your suit in your ring?

481
00:26:52,568 --> 00:26:53,945
Who are you?

482
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,657
My name is Cisco Ramon.

483
00:26:56,865 --> 00:27:00,326
And we know each other well, don't we?
We have a history together.

484
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:01,787
You could say that.

485
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:05,498
And that's all you want to know?
How I got my suit in my ring?

486
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:11,004
I want you to know that I'm the one
who figured out you were back.

487
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:15,759
I helped stop you. Me.

488
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,219
And how'd you do that?

489
00:27:18,594 --> 00:27:19,680
I have powers.

490
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:24,600
And I helped track you down
and I put you in here.

491
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:30,190
That's quite the ability
you've been given.

492
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:32,108
And here's what's so ironic about it.

493
00:27:33,694 --> 00:27:35,611
You gave me these powers.

494
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:39,615
Have fun thinking about that

495
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:43,203
while you rot away in this cell
that you helped me build.

496
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,165
Bye, Felicia.

497
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:14,234
Hey.

498
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:17,320
-Hey.
-Got your text.

499
00:28:17,528 --> 00:28:19,239
I wasn't sure that you would see me,

500
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:21,742
considering
you've been avoiding me lately.

501
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,410
Patty, I haven't been avoiding you.

502
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:31,251
No. Just, busy, you know,
speeding around Central City.

503
00:28:34,545 --> 00:28:36,047
I know you're The Flash, Barry.

504
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:37,298
Patty, come on.

505
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:39,801
Please, don't make me feel any more stupid
than I already do.

506
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:42,470
Look, I'm a detective,
and I should have known. I was just...

507
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:44,597
I was so smitten with you.

508
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:49,019
Okay, look,
what you're saying, it's insane.

509
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:51,104
Look, you don't have to
lie to me anymore, okay?

510
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:54,983
I understand, I understand why you didn't
want to tell me.

511
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:58,153
I understand why you've been distant.
Look, I understand everything.

512
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:01,782
But just tell me the truth now.
Just be honest with me. Just...

513
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:06,036
Admit to me you're The Flash,
and I'll stay.

514
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:08,288
I can't do that. I'm not him.

515
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:15,461
That's too bad.
It would've been nice to stay.

516
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:20,091
Fight crime during the day,
and be with you at night,

517
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,803
but I was wrong. Take care, Barry.

518
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:38,860
Is that you, Flash?

519
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,696
Why do you hate me so much?

520
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:44,032
I didn't always.

521
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:53,083
I was obsessed with you.
For so long, I wanted to be The Flash.

522
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:56,878
I spent years figuring out
how you came to be,

523
00:29:58,088 --> 00:30:01,883
duplicated the reaction, and it worked.

524
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:03,759
(LAUGHS)

525
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:05,345
I became like you.

526
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:08,098
All right, so what happened?

527
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:13,061
This ability to travel through time
revealed the truth.

528
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:19,150
My fate was to become your greatest enemy.
I was never going to be The Flash.

529
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:22,487
So I became the reverse
of everything that you were.

530
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:26,657
The more people you saved,
the more you were loved,

531
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:28,827
the more I had to take from you.

532
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:34,749
That is why you killed my mother?
That's why you ruined my life?

533
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:38,378
Because you couldn't be me?

534
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:40,005
I became better than you!

535

(SCOFFS)

536
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:46,845
I am the one thing you cannot stop, Flash.

537
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:52,183
No. No, no. Not anymore.
Our race is over.

538
00:30:53,684 --> 00:30:55,020
And you lost.

539
00:30:56,562 --> 00:30:59,065
I've learned what time period
you're from, Flash.

540
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:03,694
And one day soon, I'll learn your name.

541

00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:17,208
What's happening?

544
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:20,420
He's experiencing an uncontrollable amount
of electrical energy in his brain,

545
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:22,713
putting him in a prolonged state
of clonic seizing.

546

What? (STUTTERS) Can you stop it?

547
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:25,884
I don't know.

548
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:32,390
Hold him down!

549
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:33,558
We're trying!

550
00:31:33,724 --> 00:31:35,393
-Sedate him, Snow. Now!
-Come on, come on!

551
00:31:35,601 --> 00:31:37,020

-It's the timeline.
-What? What are you talking about?

559
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:57,248
When you, when you captured Reverse-Flash,
we ruptured the timeline.

That's what this... All the blood,
and the seizures, and it all.

561
00:32:00,626 --> 00:32:04,547
Cisco is being affected to...
By the changes to the timeline.

562
00:32:04,755 --> 00:32:06,424
The changes to the past,
and the changes to the present.

563
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:07,883
This is what this is.
We need to do something.

564
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:09,052
We need to do it fast.

565
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,803
-Like what?
-We need to restore the timeline.

566
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:14,099
Barry, you need to get Reverse-Flash
and send him back to the future

567
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:15,600
as quickly as possible.

568
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:17,435
-What? Are you... I just caught him!
-Barry.

569
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,812
-You want me to let him go?
-Keeping him here is killing Cisco!

570
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:23,066
Barry, if this is the only way
we can save him, you gotta do it.

571
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:24,609
You gotta let go of Thawne!

572
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:26,444
I can't... Okay. All right, look.

573
00:32:26,652 --> 00:32:28,738
(STUTTERS) I destroyed the tachyon drive
in the speed machine.

574
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,282
There's no way it'll reach the speed
necessary to send him back home.

575
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:32,951
-You can.
-What?

576
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:35,161
Your speed, coupled with Thawne's speed,

577
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:38,164
that'll be enough to catapult him
through the time continuum. You can do it.

578
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:45,005
All right.
All right, let's do it. Let's do it.

You've all messed with something
you don't understand.

582
00:32:57,517 --> 00:33:00,311
Can you do me a favor
and just shut up?

583
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:01,687
(LAUGHING)

584
00:33:03,023 --> 00:33:06,317
And how exactly
are you going to send me home?

585
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:07,527
Don't worry about it.

586
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:09,362
You fixed Dr. McGee's tachyon device.

587
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:12,782
No. I came up with a different method.

588
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:17,662
Is that so?

589
00:33:17,953 --> 00:33:18,954
Uh-huh.

590
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:20,665
Who are you?

591
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:26,671
No one of consequence.

592
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:32,718
No. I doubt that.

593
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:38,558
I win again, Flash.

594
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,688
All you have to do is provide him
with enough momentum

595
00:33:43,854 --> 00:33:45,523
to get him past the space-time barrier.

596
00:33:45,731 --> 00:33:46,691
All right.

597
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:49,069
Hey, listen to me. Thawne knows about you.

598
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:52,530
Right here, right now.

599
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:55,741
This is where he learns about you,
all of you.

600
00:33:55,991 --> 00:33:58,828
It's how he knows about S.T.A.R. Labs,
how he knows about me,

601
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:03,416
the Harrison Wells from this earth.
And there's nothing I can do about it.

602
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:09,004
There's nothing you can do about it.
This is his origin story.

603
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:12,717
And it's going to happen
no matter what you do.

604
00:34:13,759 --> 00:34:20,058
But right here, right now,
you can send him back to his time.

605
00:34:20,891 --> 00:34:24,729
You can save your friend,
you can save Cisco.

606
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:27,523
And then move on with your life.

607
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:31,861
This could be a good thing.
You can finally let go of him.

608
00:34:32,778 --> 00:34:35,740
I could throw him three centuries
from now, he'll always be a part of me.

609
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:41,537

We'll meet again soon, Flash.

00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:53,424
I know. And every time,
I'll be ready for you.

612
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:15,446
Hurry!

613
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:43,808
He did it.

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

615
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:06,456

CAITLYN:
I don't understand what we're doing here.

617
00:36:16,006 --> 00:36:19,510
Just like you, I thought that if I could
find my doppelganger on this earth,

618
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:22,888
I could replace my damaged cells
with some of his healthy ones.

619
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:26,016
Believe me, I was just as shocked as you

620
00:36:26,226 --> 00:36:29,729
when I couldn't find
a Jay Garrick anywhere on this planet.

621
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:37,862
Took me a while to figure it out.
But eventually, I found him.

622
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,284
His name is Hunter Zolomon.

623
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:46,537
Hunter Zolomon?
Why doesn't he have the same name as you?

624
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:49,790
From what I could gather,
his mother died during childbirth.

625
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,667
He bounced around from family to family

626
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:54,629
but eventually was adopted
and raised by the Zolomons.

627
00:36:58,007 --> 00:36:59,842
Why does that mean he can't help you?

628
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:03,304
My DNA was mutated
when I became a speedster.

629
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:08,142
There's only one way to reverse
what's happening to me.

630
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:12,355
If we can catch Zoom,
I can get my speed back.

631
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:15,233
Then let's finally figure out
the best way to do that.

632
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:18,736
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

633
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,997
-Wally, hi.
-Hey.

634
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:32,166
Um, do you wanna come in?

635
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:34,335
(STUTTERING) No, I can't stay. I just...

636
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:38,088
I wanted to tell you that I'm gonna
take your advice, go see my mom.

637
00:37:39,214 --> 00:37:40,215
Okay.

638
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:48,516
Iris, I was...
I was wondering if you would come with me?

639
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:51,894
Yeah, yeah, I would love that.

640
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:54,021
-Yeah?
-Okay. Um...

641
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,399
(IRIS WEST SIGHS)

642
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:01,779
(GROANING)

643
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,615
My head feels like it's in a vise.

644
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,036
What happened?

645
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:13,040
I think you vibed one too many dimensions.

646
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,293
Maybe I should stop doing that.

647
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:16,627
(LAUGHING)

648
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:18,296
Yeah, he's gonna be fine.

649
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:22,049
How did you, um, get the vibing to stop?

650
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:24,469
We sent Thawne back to his time.

651
00:38:27,262 --> 00:38:28,263
You let him go?

652
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,766
I couldn't let him take another person
I cared about.

653
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:35,813
Thank you.

654
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:37,064
Of course.

655
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:42,111
Okay. I think I need a Big Belly burger.
Anyone?

656
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,489
-I'm good, thank you.
-Yeah, no pickles.

657
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:46,156
Two triple-triples. Please.

658
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:47,408
You got money?

659
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,284
Mmm-mmm...

660
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:51,329
Rest up, all right? I'll be out here.

661
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:58,085
So, Patty,
she's on a train to Midway City right now?

662
00:38:58,293 --> 00:39:00,588
Mmm-hmm, I had to let her go, too.

663
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:03,591
Mmm, I was thinking about what you said,

664
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:10,473
about part of being The Flash is that you
have the ability to do amazing things

665
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:11,932
that nobody else can do.

666
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:14,852
And we see now that a hundred years
from now, you'll still be doing them.

667
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:19,482
But the other part is,
you're gonna be loaded with sacrifices,

668
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:23,277
and you're gonna have
hard choices to make,

669
00:39:23,653 --> 00:39:27,156
and there's gonna be a lot of things
where, eventually,

670
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:29,158
you'll have to let them go.

671
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:32,327
You gotta be ready for that.

672
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:37,332
I am. I'm ready.

673
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:39,877
That's my boy.

674
00:39:41,211 --> 00:39:42,212
(CHUCKLES)

675
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:44,173
(PHONE BUZZING)

676
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:47,718
That's weird.

677
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:50,471
Hey.

678
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,140
PATTY: <i>Barry, uh, I'm on the train.
There's a... There's a man with a gun.</i>

679
00:39:53,348 --> 00:39:55,726
All right, hold on. I'll get you help.

680
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,569
{\an8}Is everyone okay?

681
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:06,070
PATTY: Everyone's fine.

682
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:13,327
It was a false alarm.
But thanks for coming so fast, Flash.

683
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:21,836
I just want to make sure
everything's okay before I go.

684
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:26,924
Don't worry. Everything's good.

685
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:30,511
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

686
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:45,109
Goodbye, Barry.
