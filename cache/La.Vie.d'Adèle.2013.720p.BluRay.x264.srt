00:01:39,726 --> 00:01:42,353
<i>"Will I always digress?
I think so.</i>

2
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,772
<i>Impossible not to.</i>

3
00:01:44,397 --> 00:01:47,776
Ideas take hold of me.
I am a woman. I tell my story.

4
00:01:47,942 --> 00:01:49,652
Consider my words.

5
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:53,823
See how little I misuse
the privileges this gives me."

6
00:01:54,449 --> 00:01:58,369
<i>Start over from "I am a woman."
But first say it to yourself.</i>

7
00:01:59,454 --> 00:02:01,372
<i>"I am a woman" is a truth.</i>

8
00:02:01,623 --> 00:02:03,041
<i>Understand, Saïda?</i>

9
00:02:03,249 --> 00:02:06,169
<i>Start from there.
You tell your story.</i>

10
00:02:06,503 --> 00:02:07,879
<i>It's a truth.</i>

11
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:11,591
"I am a woman.
And I tell my story.

12
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:14,219
Among the young men I attracted

13
00:02:14,385 --> 00:02:16,179
was one I myself noticed.

14
00:02:16,429 --> 00:02:19,182
My gaze fell upon him
in particular.

15
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:22,101
I didn't realize
the pleasure I procured.

16
00:02:22,268 --> 00:02:24,813
I flirted with others,
not with him.

17
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:27,315
I wanted to watch him,
not please him."

18
00:02:27,482 --> 00:02:29,484
<i>Thank you, Saïda. Maëlisse?</i>

19
00:02:30,026 --> 00:02:30,860
<i>"It seems</i>

20
00:02:31,027 --> 00:02:33,446
first love begins
with this sincerity.

21
00:02:34,197 --> 00:02:37,617
Perhaps its sweetness
curtails the desire to please.

22
00:02:37,826 --> 00:02:39,619
In turn, he observed me

23
00:02:39,828 --> 00:02:42,247
differently from other young men.

24
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:45,875
More reservedly,
yet more thoughtfully.

25
00:02:46,084 --> 00:02:49,546
There was something more serious
between him and me.

26
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:52,674
Others welcomed my charms.

27
00:02:52,882 --> 00:02:56,302
I felt at times
he was not indifferent to them,

28
00:02:56,928 --> 00:03:00,557
but so confusedly,
I could not say what I thought of him

29
00:03:00,723 --> 00:03:03,059
nor of myself."

30
00:03:03,184 --> 00:03:06,437
"We left the church.
I remember walking slowly.

31
00:03:06,604 --> 00:03:08,106
I reduced my pace.

32
00:03:08,273 --> 00:03:10,650
I was sorry
to be leaving that place.

33
00:03:10,859 --> 00:03:16,155
My heart was missing something,
but it did not know what it was.

34
00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:19,325
I say it did not know.
Perhaps it did,

35
00:03:19,492 --> 00:03:25,290
for as I left, I often turned around
to see the young man I left behind

36
00:03:25,456 --> 00:03:27,876
without knowing
I did so for him."

37
00:03:28,293 --> 00:03:29,460
What does it mean

38
00:03:29,627 --> 00:03:32,297
that her heart
was missing something?

39
00:03:40,305 --> 00:03:43,474
When you exchange glances,
when you cross paths

40
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,853
and you both exchange glances
spontaneously,

41
00:03:47,729 --> 00:03:49,689
like with love at first sight,

42
00:03:49,898 --> 00:03:54,360
is there something
less or more in your heart?

43
00:03:55,153 --> 00:03:56,070
Eli...

44
00:03:56,404 --> 00:03:57,488
Regret?

45
00:03:59,157 --> 00:04:01,993
Regret about not speaking
to the person.

46
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,745
For you it's regret?

47
00:04:04,621 --> 00:04:07,790
So regret is something less
in your heart.

48
00:04:07,999 --> 00:04:11,294
Regret about not filling
the emptiness in your heart.

49
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:12,670
Thank you, Eli.

50
00:04:14,839 --> 00:04:18,259
Let's stay on this passage
and compare it

51
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:21,179
to <i>The Princess of Clèves.</i>

52
00:04:21,429 --> 00:04:25,058
Particularly when she first meets
the Duc de Nemours.

53
00:04:26,059 --> 00:04:28,686
Furthermore,
I want you to think

54
00:04:28,853 --> 00:04:32,857
about the idea of predestination
in their encounters, okay?

55
00:04:33,691 --> 00:04:37,862
Which happens, for example,
with love at first sight.

56
00:04:38,196 --> 00:04:40,782
Honestly,
if I can get laid, I will.

57
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,034
But I won't wait three months.

58
00:04:43,201 --> 00:04:45,244
Four days is all it takes.

59
00:04:45,828 --> 00:04:48,623
Who needs to wait
three months to get laid?

60
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,875
He seems a little wishy-washy.

61
00:04:51,417 --> 00:04:52,335
A little?

62
00:04:52,502 --> 00:04:54,379
He just sat there for an hour!

63
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:56,297
Just a second.

64
00:04:56,631 --> 00:04:58,383
Thomas keeps looking at you.

65
00:04:58,549 --> 00:04:59,550
Behind me?

66
00:04:59,884 --> 00:05:01,427
Look. He can't see.

67
00:05:02,387 --> 00:05:03,680
He keeps staring.

68
00:05:03,846 --> 00:05:06,099
Yeah, and it's not the first time.

69
00:05:07,392 --> 00:05:09,102
He's totally into you.

70
00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:12,855
- Never noticed?
- Come on!

71
00:05:13,064 --> 00:05:15,650
Give me a break.
I've seen him do it.

72
00:05:16,401 --> 00:05:18,486
It could be any of us.

73
00:05:20,613 --> 00:05:24,075
He's sneaking a peak.
You can look.

74
00:05:24,242 --> 00:05:25,451
I don't believe you.

75
00:05:25,618 --> 00:05:27,578
- I'm sure you can.
- Can what?

76
00:05:27,745 --> 00:05:30,039
What do you think?
Play cards?

77
00:05:31,082 --> 00:05:34,043
It's obvious
you're both into each other.

78
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:36,629
He's cool.
It's totally possible.

79
00:05:40,717 --> 00:05:42,927
Seriously, he's hung up on you.

80
00:05:44,053 --> 00:05:45,638
You think you like him?

81
00:05:46,723 --> 00:05:48,516
Sure, physically.

82
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,727
Yeah, he's cute.

83
00:05:50,893 --> 00:05:52,395
More than just "yeah."

84
00:05:52,562 --> 00:05:54,939
He's cute,
but he's not Brad Pitt.

85
00:05:56,566 --> 00:05:57,525
Pretty close!

86
00:05:57,692 --> 00:05:58,776
Honestly, he is.

87
00:05:58,943 --> 00:06:00,903
Our choices at school suck.

88
00:06:01,571 --> 00:06:02,655
Yeah, and then?

89
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,408
So he called and I told him off.

90
00:06:06,451 --> 00:06:07,452
He's gone.

91
00:06:07,618 --> 00:06:09,787
I swear, it is so in the bag!

92
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:17,378
Stop turning around, Amélie.

93
00:06:19,172 --> 00:06:20,882
She is so heavy-handed.

94
00:06:21,132 --> 00:06:22,800
I checked out his friend.

95
00:06:22,967 --> 00:06:24,427
He's not bad either.

96
00:06:24,719 --> 00:06:25,678
Hugo?

97
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,430
He is totally cute.

98
00:06:27,597 --> 00:06:29,807
No more Vincent. It's Hugo now.

99
00:06:29,974 --> 00:06:31,809
Vincent's with his sister.

100
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,478
He's so hot.

101
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,418
Can I have some more?

102
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:10,515
It's so good.

103
00:07:11,641 --> 00:07:12,642
Some more?

104
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,073
Thank you.

105
00:08:45,568 --> 00:08:47,486
What's up? Can I sit here?

106
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:48,696
If you want to.

107
00:08:53,868 --> 00:08:55,328
This weather sucks.

108
00:08:55,953 --> 00:08:57,038
It's crazy.

109
00:09:03,461 --> 00:09:04,629
What's the book?

110
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:06,631
Marivaux's <i>Life of Marianne.</i>

111
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:09,550
We have to do
a presentation on it.

112
00:09:10,468 --> 00:09:12,470
- Interesting?
- It's amazing.

113
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:17,141
- You're a junior?
- Yeah, and you?

114
00:09:17,475 --> 00:09:19,143
Senior. In science.

115
00:09:21,145 --> 00:09:21,979
Like it?

116
00:09:22,146 --> 00:09:24,523
It's not that I like it.

117
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,359
I'm just good in math.

118
00:09:27,485 --> 00:09:28,986
And after high school?

119
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,489
I'd like to work in music.

120
00:09:31,656 --> 00:09:33,616
Start a record label.

121
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:36,619
Discover artists,
start a production company.

122
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:38,746
And do you –

123
00:09:39,163 --> 00:09:42,375
- You play, or just want to produce?
- I play too.

124
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:43,501
What?

125
00:09:43,668 --> 00:09:45,086
I play percussion...

126
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:47,004
guitar, piano.

127
00:09:47,338 --> 00:09:48,965
I'm not a pro, but –

128
00:09:50,967 --> 00:09:52,176
Where did you learn?

129
00:09:52,343 --> 00:09:54,971
On my own. With videos.

130
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,139
By listening.

131
00:10:00,685 --> 00:10:01,852
You play anything?

132
00:10:03,187 --> 00:10:06,899
I'd like to, but I'd have
to start with music class.

133
00:10:07,024 --> 00:10:08,192
It's not for me.

134
00:10:08,401 --> 00:10:09,694
It's awful.

135
00:10:09,986 --> 00:10:12,738
My mom made me go.
I hated it.

136
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,949
Turned me off for 10 years.

137
00:10:19,161 --> 00:10:20,705
What do you listen to?

138
00:10:21,372 --> 00:10:22,373
Everything.

139
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:25,209
I can get into reggae, gypsy music,

140
00:10:25,418 --> 00:10:27,795
classical, dubstep.

141
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:29,505
Everything.

142
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:33,426
Only thing I really can't stand
is hard rock.

143
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:35,845
People with long hair
who scream.

144
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:38,556
No words, no melody –
not my thing.

145
00:10:39,223 --> 00:10:41,684
It's annoying.
But everything else.

146
00:10:41,851 --> 00:10:43,144
Oh, fuck.

147
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:44,020
Why?

148
00:10:44,228 --> 00:10:45,062
Because...

149
00:10:45,438 --> 00:10:48,566
my big thing is hard rock.

150
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:52,403
I mean it. It's no joke.

151
00:10:53,446 --> 00:10:55,239
I'm into the hard stuff.

152
00:10:55,406 --> 00:10:57,491
Hard rock, hard metal.

153
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:02,496
You said it's lots of screaming.

154
00:11:02,997 --> 00:11:04,832
You may not like my stuff.

155
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:09,462
I associate it with guys
with long hair who scream.

156
00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:10,463
So I pass.

157
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:12,715
Maybe your stuff is different.

158
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:14,467
I'm sorry.

159
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:18,262
- I was kidding.
- You don't play it?

160
00:11:20,264 --> 00:11:21,891
I was trying to fix things.

161
00:11:22,058 --> 00:11:24,101
I couldn't.
I kept blabbering on.

162
00:11:24,268 --> 00:11:27,063
You really think
they all have long hair?

163
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:28,189
Almost.

164
00:11:28,439 --> 00:11:30,733
I don't play it, but it's not true.

165
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,443
But you don't play it?

166
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:35,946
I'll play you my stuff.

167
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:38,074
Yeah, cool. I'd like that.

168
00:11:40,618 --> 00:11:43,245
That way we have
to get together again.

169
00:13:21,177 --> 00:13:22,136
Sorry.

170
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:40,654
You okay?

171
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:42,072
Fine, and you?

172
00:13:44,116 --> 00:13:46,827
- Sorry, I got held up.
- No problem.

173
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:48,329
The train was late.

174
00:13:49,121 --> 00:13:50,414
Been waiting long?

175
00:13:51,624 --> 00:13:52,833
What now?

176
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,420
You want to eat something?
A waffle, a crepe.

177
00:13:56,587 --> 00:13:58,422
We can sit outside.

178
00:13:59,548 --> 00:14:01,133
But a gyro instead.

179
00:14:15,981 --> 00:14:18,234
You got me slaving away
this weekend.

180
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,401
Why?

181
00:14:20,069 --> 00:14:21,445
<i>Life of Marianne.</i>

182
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,864
- You read it?
- I tried. I started.

183
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:24,865
And?

184
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:27,284
It's pretty tough. Slow-going.

185
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,453
You mean you don't like it?

186
00:14:29,662 --> 00:14:31,288
Thick books like that...

187
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:33,582
they put me off.

188
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:37,169
I put down some short books
after two pages.

189
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,172
But how can anyone not like it?

190
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:41,632
I didn't say that.

191
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:44,718
It's all that...

192
00:14:45,261 --> 00:14:48,931
that vocabulary,
the long sentences, the old stuff.

193
00:14:50,099 --> 00:14:51,934
There's lots of description.

194
00:14:52,184 --> 00:14:55,187
He explores sentiments
but gets under her skin.

195
00:14:55,312 --> 00:14:57,940
Who knows?
Maybe you'll make me like it.

196
00:14:58,107 --> 00:14:59,692
I'll try to read it all.

197
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,027
Ever read a book you liked?

198
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:04,280
Have you read a book you liked?

199
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:05,864
I never read a book!

200
00:15:06,031 --> 00:15:08,659
You never finished
a book you liked?

201
00:15:10,244 --> 00:15:11,287
Never?

202
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:13,872
There was one book I got into.

203
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,250
But I didn't read it alone.

204
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:17,876
What was it?

205
00:15:18,502 --> 00:15:20,129
<i>Dangerous Liaisons.</i>

206
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:22,923
Choderlos de Laclos.

207
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:25,509
You learned that by heart.

208
00:15:26,677 --> 00:15:28,470
Alone, I'd have missed out.

209
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:32,850
Maybe you'd have found
your own reasons for liking it.

210
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:37,187
He explained each chapter,
each letter, analyzed stuff.

211
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:39,356
It's a bunch of letters.

212
00:15:39,523 --> 00:15:43,027
You don't find it a pain,
a teacher explaining it all?

213
00:15:43,193 --> 00:15:45,070
It made it come to life.

214
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:49,074
I got into the double-dealing.
At one point he writes

215
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:51,577
to the "Marquise de Merqueuil."

216
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:56,540
He says he loves her,
but he's writing on a whore's back.

217
00:15:56,707 --> 00:15:58,876
When you read every other line,

218
00:15:59,168 --> 00:16:01,754
it's another letter,
but she doesn't know.

219
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,922
I'd never have gotten that.

220
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:07,384
That stuff goes over my head.

221
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:09,845
But in the end I got really into it.

222
00:16:10,763 --> 00:16:11,972
I'm the opposite.

223
00:16:12,598 --> 00:16:14,558
- You read a lot?
- I love to.

224
00:16:15,601 --> 00:16:19,146
When a teacher makes me
overanalyze a book

225
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:20,397
or a text,

226
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:24,401
tying everything
into the author's life,

227
00:16:24,568 --> 00:16:27,571
it closes off my imagination.
I don't like it.

228
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:31,575
But why <i>Marianne</i> in particular?

229
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:33,243
I was going to ask.

230
00:16:33,577 --> 00:16:34,787
Why that one?

231
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,872
Finish and you'll see why.

232
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:38,332
I'll read it.

233
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:41,794
I swear I'll read
<i>Life of Marianne.</i>

234
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:45,214
Careful what you say.
It's 600 pages.

235
00:16:45,589 --> 00:16:47,841
I'll read it.
I don't give a fuck.

236
00:19:34,383 --> 00:19:35,717
You look like crap.

237
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:37,511
You didn't sleep?

238
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:41,431
You fucked. I smell it on you.

239
00:19:41,682 --> 00:19:43,475
How did it go with Thomas?

240
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,061
Sleep with him?

241
00:19:48,564 --> 00:19:50,190
That's not an answer.

242
00:19:50,357 --> 00:19:51,441
I'm pregnant.

243
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:53,986
I'm pregnant.
We're tying the knot.

244
00:19:54,778 --> 00:19:56,196
Sleep at his place?

245
00:19:57,406 --> 00:19:59,032
- Details.
- There are none.

246
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:01,034
What did you two do?

247
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:02,703
Spent the afternoon together.

248
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,580
No afternoon fucks?

249
00:20:05,706 --> 00:20:07,082
So you deny it.

250
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:09,418
What are you, a sex cop?

251
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:11,962
I want details.

252
00:20:12,296 --> 00:20:14,965
It's obvious you fucked.
Why not say so?

253
00:20:15,132 --> 00:20:16,842
I didn't or I'd say so.

254
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,511
You didn't sleep.
What did you do?

255
00:20:19,678 --> 00:20:21,013
Go on, say it.

256
00:20:21,597 --> 00:20:22,848
Come on.

257
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:25,183
Because it sucked?

258
00:20:25,309 --> 00:20:28,312
I'd tell you, whatever happened.
I promise.

259
00:20:30,105 --> 00:20:30,981
I don't buy it.

260
00:20:31,315 --> 00:20:33,650
With her face, the smell on her –

261
00:20:33,817 --> 00:20:35,652
I'm going in. And you?

262
00:20:35,861 --> 00:20:37,112
We're coming.

263
00:20:38,155 --> 00:20:39,615
I smell it from here.

264
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:42,034
You are so gross.

265
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:44,828
Since when is fucking a crime?

266
00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:46,455
He's following her.

267
00:20:46,622 --> 00:20:48,665
Straight to the bathroom!

268
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,018
Adèle?

269
00:21:10,062 --> 00:21:11,104
Got a sec?

270
00:21:13,065 --> 00:21:14,691
I feel like you're avoiding me.

271
00:21:18,862 --> 00:21:20,364
I don't know, maybe...

272
00:21:21,573 --> 00:21:24,576
you misunderstood,
or I went about it too fast.

273
00:21:26,536 --> 00:21:28,455
In fact I like you a lot.

274
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,460
Nothing to say?

275
00:23:56,728 --> 00:23:58,105
It wasn't good?

276
00:23:58,855 --> 00:23:59,856
Yes.

277
00:24:09,074 --> 00:24:10,659
It was great.

278
00:24:25,715 --> 00:24:26,967
Say something.

279
00:24:32,722 --> 00:24:34,432
I feel like I'm faking.

280
00:24:35,433 --> 00:24:36,977
Faking everything.

281
00:24:37,811 --> 00:24:40,438
If he's getting you
so worked up –

282
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:41,857
No, it's me.

283
00:24:42,023 --> 00:24:44,985
He's not the problem.
I'm missing something.

284
00:24:46,403 --> 00:24:48,572
I'm all messed up.
I'm crazy.

285
00:24:48,738 --> 00:24:50,073
There's a reason.

286
00:24:50,282 --> 00:24:52,826
You're not sad out of the blue.

287
00:24:53,952 --> 00:24:55,537
There have to be reasons.

288
00:25:11,928 --> 00:25:14,222
Come on,
stop torturing yourself.

289
00:25:30,155 --> 00:25:31,448
I look like crap.

290
00:25:31,865 --> 00:25:33,742
Come on, you're gorgeous.

291
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:35,619
- Stop.
- I mean it.

292
00:25:35,785 --> 00:25:38,830
- Think I don't see myself?
- How can you?

293
00:25:39,247 --> 00:25:42,375
My nose is running,
my hair's all oily.

294
00:25:43,543 --> 00:25:44,961
My face is a mess.

295
00:25:46,463 --> 00:25:47,631
Adds to your charm.

296
00:25:49,883 --> 00:25:51,343
Thank God I have you.

297
00:25:51,968 --> 00:25:53,428
You'll make him dump you.

298
00:25:56,723 --> 00:25:57,641
Bastard.

299
00:25:57,807 --> 00:25:59,643
I won't have to tell him.

300
00:26:00,227 --> 00:26:03,355
If he sees me like this,
he'll say, "Beat it."

301
00:26:04,272 --> 00:26:06,358
I'll answer,
"Okay. You sure?"

302
00:26:47,691 --> 00:26:49,025
It's over.

303
00:26:49,442 --> 00:26:50,735
All settled.

304
00:26:55,865 --> 00:26:57,659
I'm sorry. I swear I am.

305
00:28:52,982 --> 00:28:55,193
Students, take to the streets!

306
00:28:57,862 --> 00:28:59,823
No to privatization!

307
00:29:01,783 --> 00:29:03,952
No to job cuts!

308
00:29:04,077 --> 00:29:05,662
No to austerity measures!

309
00:29:05,829 --> 00:29:08,790
More money for education!

310
00:29:41,489 --> 00:29:45,368
<i>From the city projects
to the faraway countryside</i>

311
00:29:45,577 --> 00:29:48,997
<i>We're society's rejects,
always on the outside</i>

312
00:29:49,122 --> 00:29:52,709
<i>We cannot find our place
We do not have the right face</i>

313
00:29:52,876 --> 00:29:56,379
<i>Born without a silver spoon

314
00:29:56,588 --> 00:30:00,216

Got no papers, we're the mob</i>

319
00:30:59,734 --> 00:31:01,778

<i>"Little" is a word

<i>in the play.</i>

322
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:11,120
<i>It's a word that stigmatizes</i>

323

childhood,
and powerlessness too.

324
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:17,085
Childhood is a time –
no longer for you –

325
00:31:17,418 --> 00:31:20,338
when we're helpless.
Not big enough,

326
00:31:20,505 --> 00:31:23,091
not mature enough,
not strong enough.

327
00:31:23,508 --> 00:31:25,301
Antigone is still a child.

328
00:31:25,468 --> 00:31:28,596
She's still little.
"Too little," as she says.

329
00:31:28,805 --> 00:31:32,475
But she refuses to be little anymore.
Not that day.

330
00:31:32,684 --> 00:31:35,812
It's the day she will say no.

331
00:31:35,979 --> 00:31:38,815
The day she says no,
the day she dies.

332
00:31:39,023 --> 00:31:40,400
What we have here

333
00:31:40,567 --> 00:31:43,319
is a perfect example of tragedy.

334
00:31:43,486 --> 00:31:45,530
Tragedy is the unavoidable.

335
00:31:45,738 --> 00:31:47,824
It's what we cannot escape,

336
00:31:47,991 --> 00:31:48,825
no matter what.

337
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:50,535
It concerns eternity.

338
00:31:50,743 --> 00:31:52,704
It concerns what is timeless.

339
00:31:52,829 --> 00:31:55,623
It concerns the mechanism,
the essence,

340
00:31:55,832 --> 00:31:56,916
of humankind.

341
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:17,395
- You okay?
- And you?

342
00:32:17,562 --> 00:32:19,606
I was bored stiff in French.

343
00:32:21,524 --> 00:32:22,650
Got a light?

344
00:32:32,285 --> 00:32:33,995
You okay? Not too cold?

345
00:32:34,162 --> 00:32:35,204
We're fine.

346
00:32:37,165 --> 00:32:38,207
Alice is cute.

347
00:32:41,669 --> 00:32:43,671
She has a nice little ass.

348
00:32:52,263 --> 00:32:53,806
Checking out her ass?

349
00:32:55,099 --> 00:32:57,560
I just noticed it
when she walked by.

350
00:32:58,811 --> 00:33:02,231
The kind of girl I like.
Something cool about her.

351
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:08,279
Don't be jealous.
You're cute too.

352
00:33:09,697 --> 00:33:11,074
I'm not jealous.

353
00:33:12,241 --> 00:33:13,284
You sure?

354
00:33:15,828 --> 00:33:17,246
You know it anyway.

355
00:33:18,456 --> 00:33:19,457
Know what?

356
00:33:19,624 --> 00:33:21,292
That you're really cute.

357
00:33:25,505 --> 00:33:28,257
You're one of the prettiest girls
in our grade.

358
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:30,677
It's true.

359
00:33:30,885 --> 00:33:33,012
Surprised to hear me say it?

360
00:33:36,224 --> 00:33:38,893
I like that mysterious side of yours.

361
00:33:41,312 --> 00:33:43,231
I bet the guys love it.

362
00:33:43,356 --> 00:33:44,232
Not really.

363
00:33:47,068 --> 00:33:48,945
Anyway, I find you cute.

364
00:33:50,113 --> 00:33:51,072
Thanks.

365
00:33:52,448 --> 00:33:54,117
Even cuter than Alice.

366
00:33:59,539 --> 00:34:01,040
Are you blushing?

367
00:34:01,582 --> 00:34:02,667
Not at all.

368
00:34:09,382 --> 00:34:10,299
You are too!

369
00:34:14,554 --> 00:34:15,471
Let me see.

370
00:34:16,264 --> 00:34:17,140
Am I?

371
00:34:34,407 --> 00:34:35,992
It's freezing.

372
00:34:40,621 --> 00:34:43,541
- I'm dying to skip English.
- Me too.

373
00:34:51,799 --> 00:34:53,009
See you later?

374
00:34:53,342 --> 00:34:54,343
Bye.

375
00:35:22,955 --> 00:35:24,040
The drumstick?

376
00:35:24,207 --> 00:35:25,583
I don't care.

377
00:35:29,212 --> 00:35:30,630
Give me your plate.

378
00:35:35,259 --> 00:35:37,220
I'll give you potatoes after.

379
00:35:38,012 --> 00:35:39,347
What's wrong with it?

380
00:35:39,472 --> 00:35:42,225
No idea.
It cooked long enough.

381
00:35:42,391 --> 00:35:44,268
It's hard to take apart.

382
00:35:44,644 --> 00:35:46,813
- Want some?
- Yes, please.

383
00:35:58,616 --> 00:36:00,076
Give me your plate.

384
00:36:01,202 --> 00:36:02,995
You seem out of it, Adèle.

385
00:36:03,412 --> 00:36:04,497
Enjoy.

386
00:36:05,206 --> 00:36:06,165
Want some?

387
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:07,416
Yes, please.

388
00:36:17,176 --> 00:36:17,844
What?

389
00:36:18,052 --> 00:36:20,763
You look like you had a great day.

390
00:36:22,849 --> 00:36:23,808
I guess so.

391
00:36:24,225 --> 00:36:25,476
It shows.

392
00:36:32,358 --> 00:36:33,901
Not hungry?

393
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:35,319
I'd like some salad.

394
00:37:09,145 --> 00:37:10,146
How are you?

395
00:37:12,815 --> 00:37:13,816
And you?

396
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:41,469
Sorry, I didn't think...

397
00:37:45,348 --> 00:37:47,350
that you'd get so hooked.

398
00:37:50,478 --> 00:37:53,356
What happened
yesterday was just –

399
00:37:55,358 --> 00:37:58,361
It happened
on the spur of the moment.

400
00:38:04,325 --> 00:38:06,869
I didn't think
you'd make much of it.

401
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:11,874
Understand?

402
00:38:14,377 --> 00:38:17,964
Nothing will change between us.
I won't tell anyone.

403
00:38:22,718 --> 00:38:23,803
I'm sorry.

404
00:38:30,643 --> 00:38:31,727
See you later.

405
00:39:23,487 --> 00:39:24,780
Come here.

406
00:39:40,046 --> 00:39:41,422
Can't she hear me?

407
00:39:44,383 --> 00:39:46,093
Why did you ignore me?

408
00:39:47,428 --> 00:39:48,471
What is it?

409
00:39:48,637 --> 00:39:49,597
Nothing.

410
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:52,850
- Tell me what it is.
- Nothing.

411
00:39:53,476 --> 00:39:55,436
- Talk to me.
- Let's go out.

412
00:40:12,745 --> 00:40:14,538
What's up?

413
00:40:15,915 --> 00:40:17,833
Adèle, my friends.

414
00:40:20,503 --> 00:40:22,338
How are you?

415
00:40:25,716 --> 00:40:26,759
Nice to see you.

416
00:40:26,926 --> 00:40:27,968
You okay?

417
00:40:35,351 --> 00:40:37,645
Come on and dance a little.

418
00:40:37,853 --> 00:40:38,854
Want to dance?

419
00:40:39,438 --> 00:40:41,023
I'll finish my drink first.

420
00:40:41,232 --> 00:40:42,566
Let's all dance.

421
00:40:42,733 --> 00:40:44,527
I'll watch you, then I'll come.

422
00:40:45,152 --> 00:40:46,237
Promise?

423
00:41:34,577 --> 00:41:38,414
Love has no gender.
Take whoever loves you.

424
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:41,292
Whatever makes you happy.
Who cares?

425
00:41:41,417 --> 00:41:43,586
True love.

426
00:41:43,919 --> 00:41:47,423
Even if we have to die tomorrow,
who cares?

427
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:39,576
How are you?
Looking for someone?

428
00:43:40,744 --> 00:43:42,204
I'm meeting a friend.

429
00:43:42,371 --> 00:43:43,414
Too bad.

430
00:43:43,706 --> 00:43:44,999
Enjoy your evening.

431
00:45:52,084 --> 00:45:53,043
First time here?

432
00:45:54,586 --> 00:45:55,504
You seem lost.

433
00:45:56,505 --> 00:45:59,258
I'd buy you a drink,
but you've got one.

434
00:46:01,343 --> 00:46:02,469
Are you okay?

435
00:46:02,594 --> 00:46:03,595
Yeah.

436
00:46:06,181 --> 00:46:07,558
Talking to my cousin?

437
00:46:07,724 --> 00:46:08,851
Your cousin?

438
00:46:13,814 --> 00:46:14,857
Can I go?

439
00:46:15,023 --> 00:46:16,483
Be my guest.

440
00:46:16,608 --> 00:46:17,734
Be good.

441
00:46:20,529 --> 00:46:22,865
Sophie, strawberry milk, please.

442
00:46:25,075 --> 00:46:26,994
Why are you here all alone?

443
00:46:29,371 --> 00:46:30,706
I don't know.

444
00:46:32,166 --> 00:46:33,792
I came in here by chance.

445
00:46:36,545 --> 00:46:37,713
By chance.

446
00:46:40,007 --> 00:46:42,551
You're drinking a Bulldog.

447
00:46:43,385 --> 00:46:44,887
Bull dyke beer.

448
00:46:46,555 --> 00:46:47,723
I had no idea.

449
00:46:47,848 --> 00:46:48,974
Sure is.

450
00:46:54,229 --> 00:46:55,314
Taste this.

451
00:47:01,361 --> 00:47:02,321
So?

452
00:47:02,988 --> 00:47:04,156
You like it?

453
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:05,866
Honestly?

454
00:47:07,201 --> 00:47:08,577
You won't be upset?

455
00:47:08,744 --> 00:47:10,245
No, go ahead.

456
00:47:11,205 --> 00:47:12,247
It's gross.

457
00:47:18,587 --> 00:47:19,880
I love it.

458
00:47:23,258 --> 00:47:24,760
Your type is rare here.

459
00:47:27,221 --> 00:47:28,430
What's my type?

460
00:47:29,348 --> 00:47:30,766
Your type...

461
00:47:30,891 --> 00:47:32,851
I don't know, underage...

462
00:47:33,018 --> 00:47:34,895
hanging out in bars at night.

463
00:47:45,447 --> 00:47:47,366
How do you know I'm underage?

464
00:47:47,699 --> 00:47:49,368
I can just tell.

465
00:47:49,493 --> 00:47:50,285
Or else...

466
00:47:52,287 --> 00:47:54,373
a straight girl who's a little

467
00:47:54,581 --> 00:47:56,083
curious.

468
00:47:57,793 --> 00:48:00,712
Like I said,
I came in here by chance.

469
00:48:02,631 --> 00:48:04,466
No such thing as chance.

470
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:08,136
Think so?

471
00:48:13,976 --> 00:48:15,143
What's your name?

472
00:48:15,811 --> 00:48:17,020
Adèle.

473
00:48:18,021 --> 00:48:19,606
Pretty name, Adèle.

474
00:48:21,316 --> 00:48:24,653
Adèle means something in Arabic.
I think it means

475
00:48:25,279 --> 00:48:26,488
sun.

476
00:48:26,905 --> 00:48:27,781
Hope.

477
00:48:27,906 --> 00:48:28,824
Love.

478
00:48:30,117 --> 00:48:31,660
It means justice.

479
00:48:31,827 --> 00:48:32,828
I was close.

480
00:48:33,328 --> 00:48:34,329
Sun...

481
00:48:40,335 --> 00:48:41,837
What's your name?

482
00:48:42,713 --> 00:48:43,922
My name's Emma.

483
00:48:45,632 --> 00:48:47,134
What do you do?

484
00:48:48,051 --> 00:48:49,845
What do you think?

485
00:48:50,929 --> 00:48:52,222
Hairdresser?

486
00:48:58,687 --> 00:49:00,439
Fourth year of Fine Arts.

487
00:49:00,647 --> 00:49:01,857
Fine Arts?

488
00:49:02,774 --> 00:49:04,026
You like it?

489
00:49:04,735 --> 00:49:06,278
Yeah, I do.

490
00:49:08,447 --> 00:49:10,198
Why is it called Fine Arts?

491
00:49:10,365 --> 00:49:12,451
Are there arts that are ugly?

492
00:49:13,994 --> 00:49:16,455
No ugly arts. I mean...

493
00:49:17,914 --> 00:49:19,499
some can be ugly.

494
00:49:19,875 --> 00:49:21,877
But it's subjective.

495
00:49:22,336 --> 00:49:26,214
Because there are also
Decorative Arts, Applied Arts.

496
00:49:26,381 --> 00:49:28,216
There's no Ugly Arts school.

497
00:49:28,550 --> 00:49:29,468
Why not?

498
00:49:30,552 --> 00:49:32,721
That's a good point.

499
00:49:33,138 --> 00:49:35,891
At the time of the Impressionists,

500
00:49:36,016 --> 00:49:37,893
everyone who was rejected

501
00:49:38,018 --> 00:49:40,562
from the Salon
for beautiful paintings

502
00:49:40,729 --> 00:49:43,315
and everyone who was considered...

503
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:46,568
"ugly" went to the Salon of the...

504
00:49:46,735 --> 00:49:47,736
Ugly.

505
00:49:48,028 --> 00:49:51,281
Sort of the Salon of the Ugly.
The best artists.

506
00:49:51,573 --> 00:49:52,908
You like painting?

507
00:49:53,742 --> 00:49:55,702
I don't know much, but I like it.

508
00:49:56,119 --> 00:49:57,412
What do you know?

509
00:49:58,246 --> 00:49:59,373
Picasso.

510
00:50:00,916 --> 00:50:01,792
And...

511
00:50:01,958 --> 00:50:02,959
Picasso.

512
00:50:04,211 --> 00:50:05,420
So you already know...

513
00:50:05,837 --> 00:50:06,838
Picasso.

514
00:50:11,134 --> 00:50:12,761
What do you do, Adèle?

515
00:50:14,554 --> 00:50:15,972
I'm in school.

516
00:50:16,139 --> 00:50:18,350
Oh yeah? What are you studying?

517
00:50:19,309 --> 00:50:22,145
Literature.
I haven't graduated yet.

518
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,443
I'm in high school.
I'm doing French lit.

519
00:50:28,610 --> 00:50:29,945
Okay, I see.

520
00:50:30,737 --> 00:50:32,572
What's your favorite subject?

521
00:50:33,949 --> 00:50:35,325
Depends on the teacher.

522
00:50:35,742 --> 00:50:37,619
If the teacher inspires me,

523
00:50:38,036 --> 00:50:40,539
I like it all.
I find it interesting.

524
00:50:41,206 --> 00:50:44,334
It's a problem,
because my grades can vary.

525
00:50:44,459 --> 00:50:47,587
They can drop
from 15 to 4 in a year.

526
00:50:47,838 --> 00:50:49,172
From 15 to 4?

527
00:50:53,135 --> 00:50:55,262
With you it's all or nothing.

528
00:50:57,973 --> 00:50:59,099
But...

529
00:50:59,391 --> 00:51:02,477
they don't vary in French,
because I love to read.

530
00:51:03,603 --> 00:51:04,896
And languages too.

531
00:51:05,814 --> 00:51:07,190
Because –

532
00:51:07,482 --> 00:51:10,485
- In fact I love English.
- I'm lousy at English.

533
00:51:11,069 --> 00:51:11,987
Really?

534
00:51:12,571 --> 00:51:15,073
It's something I'd really like to –

535
00:51:16,032 --> 00:51:18,201
I should take English classes.

536
00:51:18,368 --> 00:51:20,871
My accent is shit.
It's horrible.

537
00:51:21,830 --> 00:51:23,832
- I'm really good.
- Really?

538
00:51:25,041 --> 00:51:25,917
Lucky you.

539
00:51:29,045 --> 00:51:31,923
And since I love American movies,

540
00:51:32,507 --> 00:51:36,219
now I can watch movies
without subtitles. It helps me.

541
00:51:36,803 --> 00:51:38,054
What was that?

542
00:51:44,519 --> 00:51:45,854
I can't remember.

543
00:51:46,021 --> 00:51:47,147
Say it.

544
00:51:47,856 --> 00:51:49,357
I love American movies.

545
00:51:49,691 --> 00:51:50,859
Like what?

546
00:51:51,818 --> 00:51:54,946
I love it all. Scorsese, Kubrick...

547
00:51:55,113 --> 00:51:56,490
Hey, honey.

548
00:51:57,407 --> 00:51:58,533
What're you up to?

549
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:00,827
Not saying hi to my cousin?

550
00:52:01,870 --> 00:52:03,121
Cut it out.

551
00:52:03,288 --> 00:52:06,041
How old is your cousin?

552
00:52:07,709 --> 00:52:09,211
Allowed to be here?

553
00:52:09,628 --> 00:52:11,963
Girls, show some respect.

554
00:52:14,716 --> 00:52:17,719
We're going clubbing in Belgium.
Want to come?

555
00:52:17,928 --> 00:52:20,347
- Good for you.
- What? You coming?

556
00:52:21,264 --> 00:52:23,183
Come along with us, honey.

557
00:52:23,350 --> 00:52:25,519
You can bring your cousin.

558
00:52:25,685 --> 00:52:26,937
Hey, cousin...

559
00:52:29,564 --> 00:52:30,941
She's cute!

560
00:52:33,902 --> 00:52:35,237
We'll be waiting.

561
00:52:39,366 --> 00:52:40,700
Five minutes!

562
00:52:44,746 --> 00:52:46,206
What high school?

563
00:52:46,373 --> 00:52:47,499
Pasteur.

564
00:52:49,501 --> 00:52:50,752
Damn it, Emma!

565
00:52:50,961 --> 00:52:53,004
I can't talk for five minutes!

566
00:53:22,492 --> 00:53:23,702
What do I owe you?

567
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:25,203
It's paid for.

568
00:54:25,263 --> 00:54:26,306
How did you do?

569
00:54:26,473 --> 00:54:29,809
I flunked it big-time.
And I studied during break.

570
00:54:30,018 --> 00:54:31,394
You cheated.

571
00:54:31,561 --> 00:54:34,856
You were caught red-handed,
like an asshole.

572
00:54:50,622 --> 00:54:52,540
- How are you?
- And you?

573
00:54:54,042 --> 00:54:56,878
I was nearby.
I thought we'd have a drink.

574
00:55:01,091 --> 00:55:02,884
Adèle, you know her?

575
00:55:16,898 --> 00:55:18,692
See that tomboy?

576
00:55:20,568 --> 00:55:22,070
Where are they going?

577
00:56:01,276 --> 00:56:02,485
Can I move?

578
00:56:02,736 --> 00:56:04,446
- Sure you can.
- Really?

579
00:56:05,530 --> 00:56:06,906
No, stay like that.

580
00:56:09,951 --> 00:56:12,287
- Seriously?
- Yeah, you can move.

581
00:56:17,167 --> 00:56:18,126
Thanks.

582
00:56:18,793 --> 00:56:19,794
Thanks for what?

583
00:56:21,337 --> 00:56:22,338
Just thanks.

584
00:56:24,132 --> 00:56:25,133
Embarrassed?

585
00:56:26,092 --> 00:56:27,218
A little.

586
00:56:27,385 --> 00:56:28,595
Really?

587
00:56:28,928 --> 00:56:29,804
Yeah.

588
00:56:30,472 --> 00:56:32,182
It doesn't make you happy?

589
00:56:33,224 --> 00:56:34,601
It does.

590
00:56:35,727 --> 00:56:36,603
Doesn't show.

591
00:56:36,895 --> 00:56:39,898
I don't get sketched every day.

592
00:56:52,243 --> 00:56:54,245
You often draw people you meet?

593
00:56:55,121 --> 00:56:56,372
No, not often.

594
00:56:57,332 --> 00:56:58,833
I just felt like it.

595
00:57:03,463 --> 00:57:06,841
- My hair isn't a mess?
- It's pretty. Don't touch.

596
00:57:08,927 --> 00:57:10,386
I rarely do portraits.

597
00:57:11,137 --> 00:57:12,347
I pick a detail.

598
00:57:13,139 --> 00:57:14,724
And I use it again after.

599
00:57:15,642 --> 00:57:16,684
Differently.

600
00:57:16,851 --> 00:57:18,186
It can be...

601
00:57:18,978 --> 00:57:21,022
a skin fold by the lips

602
00:57:21,648 --> 00:57:23,441
or an emotion in the eyes.

603
00:57:24,818 --> 00:57:27,529
"The mysterious weakness
of man's face."

604
00:57:28,238 --> 00:57:30,281
- Know that?
- I don't think so.

605
00:57:30,573 --> 00:57:31,574
Sartre.

606
00:57:32,826 --> 00:57:34,786
- Know him?
- Yeah, but I never heard that.

607
00:57:37,205 --> 00:57:39,874
I tried his essays,
but I didn't understand.

608
00:57:40,375 --> 00:57:43,211
I prefer his plays.
You know <i>Dirty Hands?</i>

609
00:57:44,212 --> 00:57:45,421
- Like it?
- Love it.

610
00:57:45,588 --> 00:57:46,714
Me too.

611
00:57:47,549 --> 00:57:49,884
Try <i>Existentialism is a Humanism.</i>

612
00:57:50,385 --> 00:57:51,594
Good introduction.

613
00:57:52,178 --> 00:57:53,763
And not too hard.

614
00:57:54,889 --> 00:57:56,975
The idea behind Sartre is that

615
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,227
existence precedes essence.

616
00:57:59,394 --> 00:58:01,479
We're born, we exist...

617
00:58:01,646 --> 00:58:03,898
and then define ourselves
by our actions.

618
00:58:04,190 --> 00:58:06,568
It gives us a great responsibility.

619
00:58:07,068 --> 00:58:08,903
I think I read it. I'm sure.

620
00:58:10,572 --> 00:58:12,448
But I didn't understand.

621
00:58:13,658 --> 00:58:16,244
Maybe I'm bad
at philosophy, but for me,

622
00:58:16,411 --> 00:58:19,539
existence, essence
is like the chicken and the egg.

623
00:58:19,831 --> 00:58:23,251
I don't think we can
ever know what came first.

624
00:58:24,627 --> 00:58:25,879
You're funny.

625
00:58:27,463 --> 00:58:30,049
None of that stuff matters much.

626
00:58:30,758 --> 00:58:33,178
He started an intellectual revolution

627
00:58:33,887 --> 00:58:36,556
that set an entire generation free.

628
00:58:37,307 --> 00:58:39,309
He said we can choose our lives

629
00:58:39,475 --> 00:58:41,519
without any higher principle.

630
00:58:42,103 --> 00:58:44,564
I was big on Sartre in high school.

631
00:58:44,731 --> 00:58:46,858
- Really?
- It did me good.

632
00:58:48,443 --> 00:58:50,778
Especially in affirming

633
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:53,281
my freedom and my own values.

634
00:58:54,365 --> 00:58:57,327
And the rigorousness
of his commitments.

635
00:58:58,786 --> 00:58:59,913
I agree with it.

636
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:01,664
Sort of like Bob Marley.

637
00:59:03,833 --> 00:59:04,876
Almost.

638
00:59:05,251 --> 00:59:06,878
I'm not so sure of that.

639
00:59:07,045 --> 00:59:10,757
I'm almost sure of that.
Their ideas are similar.

640
00:59:11,341 --> 00:59:12,884
You know "Get Up, Stand Up"?

641
00:59:13,051 --> 00:59:14,469
Yeah, I know it.

642
00:59:15,303 --> 00:59:16,471
He's committed.

643
00:59:16,638 --> 00:59:17,680
It's true.

644
00:59:17,847 --> 00:59:18,723
Same as Sartre.

645
00:59:18,890 --> 00:59:21,726
Philosopher, prophet –
same thing.

646
00:59:22,644 --> 00:59:26,064
You can help me with philosophy,
because you seem –

647
00:59:27,482 --> 00:59:28,942
Whenever you want.

648
00:59:37,825 --> 00:59:39,077
I have to go.

649
00:59:39,994 --> 00:59:42,914
I was supposed to meet Sabine
15 minutes ago.

650
00:59:43,331 --> 00:59:44,499
Want to see?

651
00:59:45,124 --> 00:59:47,085
You don't have to like it.

652
00:59:50,338 --> 00:59:51,631
Yeah, I like it.

653
00:59:53,383 --> 00:59:56,344
It's strange,
because it's me and it isn't.

654
00:59:57,887 --> 01:00:01,516
It's a sketch.
It needs some work.

655
01:00:06,562 --> 01:00:07,772
I'll give it to you.

656
01:00:10,817 --> 01:00:12,527
Been with Sabine long?

657
01:00:13,361 --> 01:00:14,821
It's been...

658
01:00:14,988 --> 01:00:16,322
about two years.

659
01:00:17,699 --> 01:00:18,783
Why?

660
01:00:22,787 --> 01:00:23,788
I have to go.

661
01:00:24,205 --> 01:00:26,207
What's your schedule like?

662
01:00:26,416 --> 01:00:28,042
I'm studying for exams.

663
01:00:29,669 --> 01:00:32,005
But maybe I can squeeze you in.

664
01:00:33,756 --> 01:00:35,383
Yeah, I'll have time.

665
01:00:36,551 --> 01:00:38,052
Here's my number.

666
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:45,143
Promise you'll call?

667
01:00:45,351 --> 01:00:46,227
I swear.

668
01:01:14,714 --> 01:01:15,757
See you soon.

669
01:01:15,923 --> 01:01:17,050
Deal.

670
01:01:44,452 --> 01:01:46,621
<i>Here she is. Speak of the devil.</i>

671
01:01:46,746 --> 01:01:48,164
<i>A friend of yours.</i>

672
01:01:48,289 --> 01:01:49,874
<i>Someone named Emma.</i>

673
01:01:50,541 --> 01:01:52,085
<i>You're welcome. Good-bye.</i>

674
01:01:54,587 --> 01:01:57,131
<i>Just checking
you gave me the right number.</i>

675
01:01:57,507 --> 01:01:59,217
Think I'm avoiding you?

676
01:01:59,425 --> 01:02:00,551
<i>I don't know.</i>

677
01:02:00,676 --> 01:02:03,137
<i>Since I'm the weird
and imposing type.</i>

678
01:02:04,472 --> 01:02:06,349
You think you're a certain type?

679
01:02:07,266 --> 01:02:08,101
<i>Maybe.</i>

680
01:02:08,267 --> 01:02:11,312
<i>The type who's over 18
and hangs out in gay bars.</i>

681
01:02:11,479 --> 01:02:13,648
<i>I think we're pretty different.</i>

682
01:02:14,190 --> 01:02:15,400
<i>I'm not so sure.</i>

683
01:02:15,566 --> 01:02:17,902
<i>You can't tell from one meeting.</i>

684
01:02:31,999 --> 01:02:33,167
How are you?

685
01:02:33,709 --> 01:02:34,335
And you?

686
01:02:45,096 --> 01:02:45,972
Got a light?

687
01:02:46,097 --> 01:02:48,099
Who was that girl who came?

688
01:02:48,266 --> 01:02:49,267
With blue hair.

689
01:02:49,434 --> 01:02:51,102
A little bit dykey.

690
01:02:51,602 --> 01:02:53,271
- Whatever.
- Totally.

691
01:02:53,438 --> 01:02:55,231
Blue hair doesn't mean dyke.

692
01:02:55,398 --> 01:02:57,775
It's obvious she eats pussy.

693
01:02:57,900 --> 01:02:59,444
Where did you meet?

694
01:03:00,027 --> 01:03:01,654
I met her in a café.

695
01:03:01,863 --> 01:03:03,030
In a café?

696
01:03:03,197 --> 01:03:06,451
Not in a gay bar,
by chance, with Valentin?

697
01:03:07,452 --> 01:03:09,787
He said you went out with him.

698
01:03:11,873 --> 01:03:13,374
Why hang out there?

699
01:03:13,541 --> 01:03:15,001
But I don't.

700
01:03:15,209 --> 01:03:17,128
You didn't go with him?

701
01:03:17,879 --> 01:03:19,714
He told us all.

702
01:03:19,881 --> 01:03:21,883
I don't know why he said that.

703
01:03:22,049 --> 01:03:23,259
Valentin!

704
01:03:24,635 --> 01:03:27,638
You go to a gay bar with Adèle
the other night?

705
01:03:28,222 --> 01:03:30,641
- Yeah, so what?
- Just asking.

706
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:34,729
You lied. It's not good.

707
01:03:34,896 --> 01:03:37,607
I didn't lie. It's just that...

708
01:03:38,941 --> 01:03:43,029
we were out walking,
and we had a drink, that's all.

709
01:03:43,154 --> 01:03:45,907
- That was all.
- Just a drink in a gay bar.

710
01:03:46,073 --> 01:03:48,659
- Okay, no problem.
- End of story.

711
01:03:49,827 --> 01:03:51,412
We're just asking.

712
01:03:52,163 --> 01:03:54,165
Why did she come meet you here?

713
01:03:54,457 --> 01:03:56,125
Because we're friends.

714
01:03:56,584 --> 01:03:58,211
Why don't we know her

715
01:03:58,628 --> 01:04:00,046
if you're friends?

716
01:04:02,089 --> 01:04:03,925
I only just met her.

717
01:04:04,091 --> 01:04:05,968
You already eat her pussy?

718
01:04:06,135 --> 01:04:08,054
- What bullshit.
- You're fast.

719
01:04:08,554 --> 01:04:10,306
You were this close!

720
01:04:10,473 --> 01:04:12,308
We were just talking.

721
01:04:12,975 --> 01:04:14,685
Talk to friends like this?

722
01:04:14,894 --> 01:04:16,604
You talk to me like this?

723
01:04:18,689 --> 01:04:21,442
You blew me off and ran after her.

724
01:04:21,859 --> 01:04:24,278
Is she the new woman in your life?

725
01:04:25,696 --> 01:04:27,615
Fess up and tell us.

726
01:04:28,491 --> 01:04:30,159
Nothing to fess up to.

727
01:04:30,326 --> 01:04:33,538
She's a friend.
We were talking, so we were close.

728
01:04:33,704 --> 01:04:35,957
What you're saying sounds phony.

729
01:04:36,123 --> 01:04:39,085
I don't know.
It sounds phony because...

730
01:04:39,335 --> 01:04:41,295
you're all grilling me.

731
01:04:41,462 --> 01:04:42,755
Admit you eat pussy.

732
01:04:42,964 --> 01:04:46,217
I don't care if you're a lesbo.
It's your life.

733
01:04:46,384 --> 01:04:49,470
But you've slept naked
a few times in my bed.

734
01:04:49,637 --> 01:04:51,013
That's harder.

735
01:04:51,430 --> 01:04:53,099
- I'm a friend.
- I know.

736
01:04:53,224 --> 01:04:54,517
I prefer to be clear.

737
01:04:54,684 --> 01:04:55,977
So admit it.

738
01:04:56,143 --> 01:04:58,187
I won't admit to what I'm not.

739
01:04:58,354 --> 01:05:00,439
Give us a break, Adèle.

740
01:05:01,649 --> 01:05:05,194
Some lesbo comes
and picks you up at school –

741
01:05:05,361 --> 01:05:06,654
She's not a lesbo.

742
01:05:07,154 --> 01:05:10,491
Don't deny it.
You can see it from a mile away.

743
01:05:10,658 --> 01:05:11,701
You're a lesbo?

744
01:05:13,411 --> 01:05:14,412
Fess up.

745
01:05:14,579 --> 01:05:17,039
I don't care,
but keep me out of it.

746
01:05:17,206 --> 01:05:19,000
You'll never eat my pussy.

747
01:05:19,166 --> 01:05:21,627
I'd never touch you.
I'm no lesbian!

748
01:05:21,794 --> 01:05:22,920
Chill out.

749
01:05:23,045 --> 01:05:24,463
Don't tell me to chill.

750
01:05:24,630 --> 01:05:26,841
She's talking crap.
I'm fighting back.

751
01:05:27,008 --> 01:05:28,342
You're freaking out!

752
01:05:28,509 --> 01:05:32,597
You're talking crap in front of everyone.
I'm not a lesbian!

753
01:05:33,389 --> 01:05:34,390
Relax.

754
01:05:34,557 --> 01:05:36,225
- You relax.
- We're talking.

755
01:05:36,392 --> 01:05:37,393
Just fess up.

756
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:39,604
She jumped down my throat!

757
01:05:39,770 --> 01:05:41,439
Relax. How old are you?

758
01:05:41,606 --> 01:05:45,151
How old are you?
I'm not a lesbian. Are you stupid?

759
01:05:45,276 --> 01:05:47,486
You see what's going on?

760
01:05:47,653 --> 01:05:48,779
She's a whore.

761
01:05:48,988 --> 01:05:52,366
She sleeps naked in my bed,
checks out my ass.

762
01:05:53,159 --> 01:05:54,493
Cut the shit!

763
01:05:54,660 --> 01:05:56,454
Whores like you are into ass.

764
01:05:56,621 --> 01:05:59,206
Does your bitch
have a blue pussy?

765
01:06:04,587 --> 01:06:05,504
Fucking cunt!

766
01:06:11,802 --> 01:06:12,803
Fucking lesbo!

767
01:06:15,264 --> 01:06:16,265
Go eat pussy!

768
01:06:16,432 --> 01:06:17,892
What the hell?

769
01:06:18,059 --> 01:06:23,314
Why tell everyone we went to a gay bar?
Why the fuck did you do it?

770
01:06:23,481 --> 01:06:25,608
It's not the end of the world.

771
01:06:25,775 --> 01:06:28,861
It is! They all think
I'm a lesbian, that I eat pussy.

772
01:06:29,070 --> 01:06:30,821
She thinks I check out her ass.

773
01:06:31,072 --> 01:06:32,823
You said we'd ask calmly.

774
01:06:35,284 --> 01:06:36,786
Don't look. Listen to me.

775
01:06:41,999 --> 01:06:44,752
You're not talking.
You attacked her.

776
01:06:44,919 --> 01:06:46,587
She attacked us.

777
01:06:46,712 --> 01:06:49,924
She attacked physically.
But you did verbally.

778
01:06:50,091 --> 01:06:52,093
- We asked nicely.
- You did not.

779
01:06:52,259 --> 01:06:55,846
If I were a closeted fag,
I'd have done the same.

780
01:06:56,681 --> 01:06:58,474
Come on, let's fight.

781
01:06:59,558 --> 01:07:01,560
You'll never touch my pussy!

782
01:07:02,019 --> 01:07:03,062
Dirty dyke!

783
01:07:03,229 --> 01:07:04,689
Shut your face!

784
01:07:07,233 --> 01:07:11,362
<i>He mentions "a pathological scruple."
What is that?</i>

785
01:07:12,446 --> 01:07:14,907
<i>Does that mean gravity, for you?</i>

786
01:07:15,241 --> 01:07:16,075
<i>Louis?</i>

787
01:07:16,242 --> 01:07:17,827
<i>In stanza two, he says...</i>

788
01:07:18,452 --> 01:07:21,288
<i>"The only vice of water
is gravity."</i>

789
01:07:22,123 --> 01:07:26,252
He associates natural law,
the universal law of gravity,

790
01:07:26,377 --> 01:07:28,170
with a vice, as if...

791
01:07:28,671 --> 01:07:32,258
everything natural is perverted,
and vice versa.

792
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:37,972
It's sort of the opposite of...

793
01:07:38,639 --> 01:07:40,141
Catholic conservatism,

794
01:07:40,307 --> 01:07:43,936
which would say
that vice is not natural,

795
01:07:44,145 --> 01:07:45,688
and you have to...

796
01:07:47,815 --> 01:07:49,358
repress it, reject it.

797
01:07:49,525 --> 01:07:50,735
He says that

798
01:07:51,485 --> 01:07:54,822
gravity itself is a vice.
It can't be avoided.

799
01:07:55,281 --> 01:07:57,658
<i>It's totally intrinsic to water.</i>

800
01:07:57,825 --> 01:07:59,618
<i>Adèle, what do you think?</i>

801
01:08:00,536 --> 01:08:02,079
<i>About what Louis said.</i>

802
01:08:05,958 --> 01:08:07,084
I agree.

803
01:08:10,004 --> 01:08:11,964
<i>Are you following any of this?</i>

804
01:08:12,423 --> 01:08:13,299
No.

805
01:08:17,553 --> 01:08:21,515
<i>We're talking about
a vice intrinsic to water. Gravity.</i>

806
01:08:23,684 --> 01:08:26,353
<i>Start reading from "This vice..."</i>

807
01:08:30,483 --> 01:08:31,859
<i>Page 62.</i>

808
01:10:06,787 --> 01:10:08,247
Throwing away the skin?

809
01:10:08,414 --> 01:10:09,665
Yeah, why?

810
01:10:10,708 --> 01:10:11,876
You don't eat it?

811
01:10:12,293 --> 01:10:13,460
I don't like it.

812
01:10:14,044 --> 01:10:16,422
I love it. I eat all the skins.

813
01:10:18,465 --> 01:10:19,800
Rinds too.

814
01:10:20,384 --> 01:10:22,303
As a kid I even ate my scabs.

815
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:23,846
I loved them.

816
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:27,683
You're funny.

817
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:29,977
So you're really into eating.

818
01:10:30,644 --> 01:10:32,187
You can't imagine.

819
01:10:32,313 --> 01:10:33,314
I can see.

820
01:10:34,273 --> 01:10:35,649
I eat everything.

821
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:38,485
I could eat nonstop all day.

822
01:10:38,903 --> 01:10:41,322
It's scary.
Even when I'm full.

823
01:10:41,488 --> 01:10:43,240
Everything but shellfish.

824
01:10:43,407 --> 01:10:45,284
- Really?
- That's all.

825
01:10:45,868 --> 01:10:47,286
That's what I like most.

826
01:10:47,453 --> 01:10:48,662
It's beyond me.

827
01:10:50,706 --> 01:10:51,957
I love oysters.

828
01:10:52,124 --> 01:10:53,292
Really?

829
01:10:53,542 --> 01:10:55,669
The texture alone grosses me out.

830
01:10:57,296 --> 01:10:59,214
That's the best part.

831
01:10:59,715 --> 01:11:01,926
They're like little snot balls.

832
01:11:02,343 --> 01:11:03,636
Big snot balls.

833
01:11:03,761 --> 01:11:05,512
They remind me of something else.

834
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:08,223
I don't want to know.

835
01:11:18,692 --> 01:11:19,860
Something to say?

836
01:11:20,694 --> 01:11:21,862
I don't know.

837
01:11:22,029 --> 01:11:23,030
What?

838
01:11:26,533 --> 01:11:27,952
I wanted to know

839
01:11:28,535 --> 01:11:30,287
when was the first time

840
01:11:31,705 --> 01:11:33,248
that you tasted –

841
01:11:34,375 --> 01:11:36,043
Tasted a sausage?

842
01:11:36,335 --> 01:11:37,586
Tasted a girl.

843
01:11:37,753 --> 01:11:38,754
A girl?

844
01:11:42,049 --> 01:11:43,509
You mean kiss?

845
01:11:43,676 --> 01:11:44,677
Or taste?

846
01:11:46,136 --> 01:11:47,262
Kiss.

847
01:11:47,721 --> 01:11:50,015
To start with. Then we'll see.

848
01:11:52,685 --> 01:11:53,894
I was fourteen.

849
01:11:55,145 --> 01:11:56,689
Sometime around then.

850
01:11:56,939 --> 01:11:59,692
There was a party.
All the girls had guys.

851
01:12:00,401 --> 01:12:01,402
And I...

852
01:12:03,404 --> 01:12:05,030
I went out with Louise.

853
01:12:05,197 --> 01:12:06,490
That was her name.

854
01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:10,411
We didn't kiss
during the party, but...

855
01:12:11,495 --> 01:12:14,790
I asked her to sleep over.
That's when we kissed.

856
01:12:18,419 --> 01:12:20,045
You've always preferred girls?

857
01:12:20,587 --> 01:12:23,132
I tried both.
I dated boys, girls...

858
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:25,843
and I realized I preferred girls.

859
01:12:27,761 --> 01:12:28,929
For sure.

860
01:13:41,919 --> 01:13:43,420
It's nice being here.

861
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:48,467
A little too nice.

862
01:13:52,513 --> 01:13:53,514
I guess so.

863
01:25:09,522 --> 01:25:10,607
It's here.

864
01:25:16,196 --> 01:25:17,155
Mom?

865
01:25:22,535 --> 01:25:24,412
- How are you?
- Fine, and you?

866
01:25:27,957 --> 01:25:29,125
Adèle...

867
01:25:29,292 --> 01:25:30,543
my mom, Catherine.

868
01:25:31,294 --> 01:25:33,588
We've heard good things about you.

869
01:25:33,755 --> 01:25:35,215
I'm glad to be here.

870
01:25:36,382 --> 01:25:37,967
- For you.
- I'll take that.

871
01:25:38,593 --> 01:25:39,886
Very nice, thank you.

872
01:25:40,553 --> 01:25:41,679
Hi, honey.

873
01:25:42,180 --> 01:25:43,056
How are you?

874
01:25:43,223 --> 01:25:44,891
- And you?
- I'm fine.

875
01:25:45,683 --> 01:25:47,727
- We've been waiting.
- What's to eat?

876
01:25:48,394 --> 01:25:49,395
Your favorite.

877
01:25:51,523 --> 01:25:53,066
Vincent, my stepdad.

878
01:25:56,277 --> 01:25:57,612
The family cook.

879
01:25:57,779 --> 01:26:00,281
We're having white.
Okay with you?

880
01:26:00,532 --> 01:26:02,075
- Sure.
- White's fine.

881
01:26:02,283 --> 01:26:03,493
White too?

882
01:26:03,660 --> 01:26:06,246
Tell me what you think of it.
I like it.

883
01:26:06,412 --> 01:26:07,872
Vincent's new pick.

884
01:26:08,790 --> 01:26:12,085
We drank a lot
while we were waiting for you.

885
01:26:12,293 --> 01:26:14,087
- Not that much.
- True.

886
01:26:14,295 --> 01:26:15,421
We were reasonable.

887
01:26:16,005 --> 01:26:19,425
But it's always nice
to cook with a glass of white.

888
01:26:19,592 --> 01:26:21,052
My dad's the same.

889
01:26:21,427 --> 01:26:22,470
Really?

890
01:26:24,097 --> 01:26:25,265
Shall we toast?

891
01:26:26,182 --> 01:26:27,350
To love.

892
01:26:29,018 --> 01:26:30,353
Welcome, Adèle.

893
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:31,938
Big words. To love.

894
01:26:32,105 --> 01:26:33,857
Yes, to love, my love.

895
01:26:34,107 --> 01:26:34,941
To love, then.

896
01:26:43,825 --> 01:26:45,118
How is it?

897
01:26:45,785 --> 01:26:47,287
- Delicious.
- Very good.

898
01:26:47,453 --> 01:26:49,372
Good, isn't it? I like it a lot.

899
01:26:49,539 --> 01:26:52,625
Me too.
I don't know wine, but it's good.

900
01:26:55,795 --> 01:26:57,714
I bet you haven't eaten all day.

901
01:26:58,131 --> 01:26:59,382
Adèle...

902
01:26:59,549 --> 01:27:01,259
I went and bought

903
01:27:01,968 --> 01:27:04,304
the best I could find at Trière.

904
01:27:04,721 --> 01:27:05,638
You know it?

905
01:27:06,598 --> 01:27:07,557
Just by name.

906
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:10,894
- Help yourself.
- I'm fine.

907
01:27:11,102 --> 01:27:13,938
Shit, I forgot to tell you
that Adèle...

908
01:27:14,564 --> 01:27:16,566
doesn't like shellfish.

909
01:27:19,110 --> 01:27:20,111
I'm so sorry.

910
01:27:20,486 --> 01:27:22,155
No big deal.

911
01:27:22,572 --> 01:27:24,699
Seafood isn't really my thing.

912
01:27:24,866 --> 01:27:26,409
But don't worry.

913
01:27:26,576 --> 01:27:28,578
A nightmare.
It's all we have.

914
01:27:28,953 --> 01:27:30,455
You're a pain.

915
01:27:30,663 --> 01:27:33,291
I go all out,
then you come and say...

916
01:27:33,458 --> 01:27:34,667
"Adèle hates oysters."

917
01:27:34,792 --> 01:27:37,378
I'll have other stuff.
The entree too? No problem.

918
01:27:37,545 --> 01:27:39,797
- Even jumbo shrimp?
- Especially.

919
01:27:40,757 --> 01:27:44,344
No biggie. Perfect occasion
to initiate her. It's fine.

920
01:27:45,094 --> 01:27:46,888
Like at the school cafeteria.

921
01:27:47,597 --> 01:27:49,891
You squeeze lemon on the oyster.

922
01:27:51,476 --> 01:27:55,188
And usually,
if it's really good and fresh,

923
01:27:55,396 --> 01:27:56,814
it moves.

924
01:27:57,732 --> 01:27:58,942
That means...

925
01:27:59,359 --> 01:28:00,360
it's good. See?

926
01:28:00,526 --> 01:28:01,527
Look.

927
01:28:01,694 --> 01:28:03,780
- It's moving.
- Why tell me this?

928
01:28:05,114 --> 01:28:07,158
- It's alive.
- Exactly.

929
01:28:07,617 --> 01:28:09,369
It has to be alive.

930
01:28:09,535 --> 01:28:10,995
Don't eat it otherwise.

931
01:28:13,289 --> 01:28:16,042
Alive is good.
You can eat the muscle too.

932
01:28:16,209 --> 01:28:17,085
I'm fine.

933
01:28:17,961 --> 01:28:18,795
Go on.

934
01:28:19,796 --> 01:28:20,755
The juice too.

935
01:28:20,922 --> 01:28:21,881
Well?

936
01:28:24,008 --> 01:28:24,884
Well?

937
01:28:25,426 --> 01:28:27,178
- Are you okay?
- It's good.

938
01:28:27,345 --> 01:28:29,722
- You seem to enjoy it.
- It's good.

939
01:28:30,807 --> 01:28:32,308
I'll try another.

940
01:28:32,725 --> 01:28:33,726
Great.

941
01:28:34,018 --> 01:28:36,020
These are excellent oysters.

942
01:28:40,358 --> 01:28:42,318
You have beautiful paintings.

943
01:28:43,736 --> 01:28:45,947
My ex-husband was an art lover.

944
01:28:46,239 --> 01:28:49,200
Emma gets a lot of that
from her father.

945
01:28:49,367 --> 01:28:50,618
Your ex loved art

946
01:28:51,661 --> 01:28:53,371
but your new husband –

947
01:28:53,746 --> 01:28:54,914
A lover as well.

948
01:28:55,123 --> 01:28:58,042
But most of the paintings here –

949
01:28:58,751 --> 01:28:59,585
Lover of what?

950
01:28:59,752 --> 01:29:02,130
They come from her father.

951
01:29:02,588 --> 01:29:05,258
A lover of food and wine.
That counts.

952
01:29:05,425 --> 01:29:06,634
I agree.

953
01:29:06,801 --> 01:29:07,760
And also...

954
01:29:07,885 --> 01:29:09,053
culture.

955
01:29:10,763 --> 01:29:12,432
Tell us about yourself.

956
01:29:12,765 --> 01:29:15,935
We want to know about your life,

957
01:29:16,686 --> 01:29:18,229
what you want to do.

958
01:29:18,604 --> 01:29:19,981
I want to teach.

959
01:29:21,774 --> 01:29:24,360
Nursery school. I love kids.

960
01:29:26,446 --> 01:29:27,572
You love kids.

961
01:29:27,697 --> 01:29:29,907
Have you always wanted to teach?

962
01:29:30,992 --> 01:29:33,786
It's not that
I loved the school system,

963
01:29:33,911 --> 01:29:37,290
but school means a lot to me.
It's taught me a lot.

964
01:29:37,874 --> 01:29:40,418
It helped expose me to things

965
01:29:41,002 --> 01:29:43,796
that my parents or friends
didn't show me.

966
01:29:44,672 --> 01:29:46,299
I want to pass that on.

967
01:29:46,799 --> 01:29:48,468
What do you need to do?

968
01:29:49,469 --> 01:29:52,889
I'll get a masters
and then do teacher training.

969
01:29:53,056 --> 01:29:57,727
That way I can start
by being an assistant teacher.

970
01:29:58,811 --> 01:30:01,230
And honestly,
I don't see myself...

971
01:30:01,898 --> 01:30:04,400
going to school
for 10 or 15 years

972
01:30:04,525 --> 01:30:07,403
just to end up unemployed.

973
01:30:07,862 --> 01:30:10,198
I want something concrete.

974
01:30:10,490 --> 01:30:12,241
Does the job market scare you?

975
01:30:12,825 --> 01:30:14,744
I sense it in what you say.

976
01:30:15,328 --> 01:30:19,874
Maybe you'll go to school and see
that something else interests you.

977
01:30:21,125 --> 01:30:23,336
For now it's what interests me.

978
01:30:23,503 --> 01:30:26,005
At least you know
where you're going.

979
01:30:28,007 --> 01:30:30,218
And that's important, I think.

980
01:32:03,811 --> 01:32:04,812
Mom?

981
01:32:28,628 --> 01:32:33,841
<i>Happy Birthday, my sincerest wishes</i>

982
01:32:34,175 --> 01:32:39,096
<i>May these flowers bring you joy</i>

983
01:32:40,389 --> 01:32:44,477
<i>May your year be sweet and carefree</i>

984
01:32:44,644 --> 01:32:48,439
<i>And next year may we all meet again</i>

985
01:33:03,204 --> 01:33:04,705
Happy 18th, Adèle!

986
01:33:07,917 --> 01:33:09,669
Mom? Cheers.

987
01:34:52,396 --> 01:34:55,024
- He's the king of bolognese.
- Hope you like it.

988
01:34:58,611 --> 01:34:59,820
Help yourself.

989
01:35:00,154 --> 01:35:01,614
Some wine?

990
01:35:01,989 --> 01:35:03,115
Yes, please.

991
01:35:03,324 --> 01:35:04,825
Nice to meet you, Emma.

992
01:35:04,992 --> 01:35:07,620
We've heard about you for months.

993
01:35:07,953 --> 01:35:09,538
Here you are at last.

994
01:35:09,789 --> 01:35:11,374
It's great to...

995
01:35:11,791 --> 01:35:15,044
to put a face
to everything you've said.

996
01:35:15,419 --> 01:35:16,295
Really.

997
01:35:16,796 --> 01:35:18,714
I'm the one who –

998
01:35:19,340 --> 01:35:20,633
Thanks for having me.

999
01:35:20,966 --> 01:35:22,510
It's our pleasure.

1000
01:35:27,640 --> 01:35:29,225
Eat. It'll get cold.

1001
01:35:36,065 --> 01:35:39,276
It's nice of you
to help her with philosophy.

1002
01:35:40,986 --> 01:35:43,239
It's a really hard subject.

1003
01:35:43,406 --> 01:35:46,033
She was having
a tough time, but now...

1004
01:35:46,575 --> 01:35:48,411
it seems to be going well.

1005
01:35:49,161 --> 01:35:51,664
Your grades are up.
Thanks to you.

1006
01:35:51,831 --> 01:35:53,499
It's a pleasure for me.

1007
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:58,254
I wasn't going about it right.
She taught me...

1008
01:35:58,671 --> 01:36:00,214
to make outlines.

1009
01:36:00,756 --> 01:36:01,674
That's important.

1010
01:36:01,841 --> 01:36:05,845
I don't know how
they can do that subject

1011
01:36:06,011 --> 01:36:08,806
in just a year.
I don't see the point.

1012
01:36:08,973 --> 01:36:10,683
You can't do it in depth.

1013
01:36:11,225 --> 01:36:12,852
One year isn't enough.

1014
01:36:13,018 --> 01:36:14,395
- Well?
- It's delicious.

1015
01:36:14,603 --> 01:36:15,563
I knew it.

1016
01:36:16,313 --> 01:36:18,315
So you're at Beaux-Arts.

1017
01:36:20,401 --> 01:36:22,111
- It shows.
- Really?

1018
01:36:22,695 --> 01:36:24,029
It's artistic.

1019
01:36:24,321 --> 01:36:25,865
Not everyone likes it.

1020
01:36:26,574 --> 01:36:27,616
It suits you well.

1021
01:36:30,077 --> 01:36:31,287
Do you do it...

1022
01:36:32,455 --> 01:36:33,664
yourself?

1023
01:36:36,083 --> 01:36:39,086
Her stuff is great.
She's having a show.

1024
01:36:39,295 --> 01:36:40,337
Already?

1025
01:36:41,005 --> 01:36:43,048
At the end of the year
we show our work.

1026
01:36:43,883 --> 01:36:46,886
You have to let us know.
We'll come see.

1027
01:36:48,471 --> 01:36:51,849
Living off painting
is pretty hard nowadays.

1028
01:36:52,224 --> 01:36:53,392
It's difficult.

1029
01:36:54,226 --> 01:36:57,897
The people who make
a living off it are all dead.

1030
01:36:58,063 --> 01:36:59,023
It's true.

1031
01:37:01,066 --> 01:37:02,902
I'm a graphic artist too.

1032
01:37:03,736 --> 01:37:08,073
And it's easier these days
to live off graphic arts

1033
01:37:08,240 --> 01:37:09,325
than off painting.

1034
01:37:09,867 --> 01:37:11,660
There are openings in that.

1035
01:37:13,078 --> 01:37:15,539
It's important
to have an artistic side.

1036
01:37:19,543 --> 01:37:22,755
But you need a real job too.
To earn a living.

1037
01:37:23,047 --> 01:37:25,090
So if things ever get bad,

1038
01:37:25,382 --> 01:37:26,675
you make a living.

1039
01:37:32,097 --> 01:37:34,141
Not to pry,
but your boyfriend –

1040
01:37:35,851 --> 01:37:37,478
what does he do?

1041
01:37:37,686 --> 01:37:39,438
He works in business.

1042
01:37:40,147 --> 01:37:42,149
That's good. It's reassuring.

1043
01:37:42,775 --> 01:37:46,737
That way you can do
your painting and he –

1044
01:37:47,321 --> 01:37:48,989
If you want to be an artist,

1045
01:37:49,156 --> 01:37:52,409
it's nice to have a husband
who pays the bills.

1046
01:37:58,999 --> 01:38:00,209
We're not married.

1047
01:38:00,751 --> 01:38:02,169
You have time.

1048
01:38:02,670 --> 01:38:03,796
Take your time.

1049
01:38:03,963 --> 01:38:05,673
- You never know.
- True!

1050
01:38:08,300 --> 01:38:09,969
The pasta is delicious.

1051
01:38:12,429 --> 01:38:13,931
Simple but...

1052
01:38:15,516 --> 01:38:16,433
very good.

1053
01:39:08,360 --> 01:39:09,445
My love.

1054
01:39:11,572 --> 01:39:14,283
You scared me.
I thought you were going to scream.

1055
01:39:14,533 --> 01:39:16,201
I was going to shriek.

1056
01:39:18,454 --> 01:39:20,080
Good thing you didn't.

1057
01:39:29,048 --> 01:39:30,174
You're beautiful.

1058
01:39:35,137 --> 01:39:36,388
So soft.

1059
01:39:39,558 --> 01:39:43,062
My mom thinks
you're sleeping in the bed there.

1060
01:39:44,063 --> 01:39:45,230
On the cot.

1061
01:39:47,858 --> 01:39:49,860
Enjoying philosophy?

1062
01:39:50,402 --> 01:39:53,656
I love it.
It's incredibly enriching.

1063
01:39:54,406 --> 01:39:55,866
Very deep.

1064
01:39:56,075 --> 01:39:57,284
Very intense.

1065
01:39:57,660 --> 01:39:59,912
Orgasm precedes essence...

1066
01:40:00,579 --> 01:40:02,581
Your grade better be good.

1067
01:40:02,748 --> 01:40:03,916
Give me a grade.

1068
01:40:08,253 --> 01:40:09,129
Fourteen.

1069
01:40:11,674 --> 01:40:13,425
Just fourteen?

1070
01:40:16,261 --> 01:40:18,097
You still need some practice.

1071
01:40:20,516 --> 01:40:22,935
I'll give it all I've got.

1072
01:41:51,190 --> 01:41:53,275
<i>This time it must be the wolf.</i>

1073
01:41:54,276 --> 01:41:56,945
"It's Mrs. Goat,
with my seven kids.

1074
01:41:57,070 --> 01:41:59,990
Let us hide.
Have you heard the bad news?"

1075
01:42:00,616 --> 01:42:02,993
The wolf is coming back!

1076
01:42:03,786 --> 01:42:06,830
"Come inside,"
says Mr. Rabbit.

1077
01:42:08,290 --> 01:42:10,834
Everyone sits down,
and suddenly –

1078
01:42:10,959 --> 01:42:12,795
Knock, knock, knock.

1079
01:42:14,338 --> 01:42:15,464
It's the wolf!

1080
01:42:15,839 --> 01:42:17,257
It must be the wolf.

1081
01:42:17,424 --> 01:42:18,509
Must be.

1082
01:42:19,176 --> 01:42:20,427
"It's me, Little Lamb.

1083
01:42:20,594 --> 01:42:22,429
I was down by the stream.

1084
01:42:22,596 --> 01:42:25,057
But I cannot go home, because...

1085
01:42:25,224 --> 01:42:27,684
the wolf is coming back!"

1086
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:32,189
"Come in," says Mr. Rabbit.
"Come sit by the fire."

1087
01:42:35,359 --> 01:42:38,237
Little Lamb sits by the fire
when suddenly –

1088
01:42:43,575 --> 01:42:44,785
Bang it.

1089
01:42:57,256 --> 01:42:58,340
Keep moving.

1090
01:43:02,594 --> 01:43:04,263
Keep using your hands!

1091
01:43:04,429 --> 01:43:06,598
Play your drums.
Don't stop.

1092
01:43:15,649 --> 01:43:17,276
Keep on moving!

1093
01:43:38,297 --> 01:43:39,840
You don't want to play?

1094
01:43:40,215 --> 01:43:41,717
Want to stay here?

1095
01:43:41,925 --> 01:43:42,968
Hey, you.

1096
01:43:43,135 --> 01:43:44,386
Alone as usual.

1097
01:43:46,513 --> 01:43:47,472
Best behaved.

1098
01:43:47,598 --> 01:43:48,974
Always has been.

1099
01:43:53,020 --> 01:43:54,563
What are you doing tonight?

1100
01:43:55,647 --> 01:43:56,565
I don't know.

1101
01:43:56,773 --> 01:43:58,483
We're going out for a drink.

1102
01:43:58,692 --> 01:44:01,445
Sylvie, Quentin, Anabelle...

1103
01:44:01,612 --> 01:44:02,946
Want to come?

1104
01:44:04,907 --> 01:44:07,326
But tonight I have a family dinner.

1105
01:44:08,619 --> 01:44:10,954
You have a lot
of family dinners.

1106
01:44:11,496 --> 01:44:13,248
These days I do.

1107
01:44:13,457 --> 01:44:15,918
Maybe after. Around what time?

1108
01:44:16,460 --> 01:44:17,836
Are you avoiding us?

1109
01:44:17,961 --> 01:44:19,671
Why do you say that?

1110
01:44:20,172 --> 01:44:23,008
Whenever I suggest something,
you're busy.

1111
01:44:24,885 --> 01:44:26,887
Just bad timing, that's all.

1112
01:44:27,846 --> 01:44:29,014
Is your family far?

1113
01:44:30,182 --> 01:44:32,351
No, pretty close.

1114
01:44:32,517 --> 01:44:33,894
Ten kilometers.

1115
01:44:38,440 --> 01:44:39,691
Okay, then.

1116
01:44:40,984 --> 01:44:42,653
I hope you'll be able

1117
01:44:43,904 --> 01:44:45,197
to get free.

1118
01:44:46,198 --> 01:44:47,950
I'll do my best.

1119
01:44:48,700 --> 01:44:50,202
I swear I will.

1120
01:46:11,950 --> 01:46:13,535
<i>It's gorgeous!</i>

1121
01:46:17,122 --> 01:46:20,542
I've seen you on canvas.
Finally in flesh and blood.

1122
01:46:28,633 --> 01:46:29,968
Congratulations!

1123
01:46:47,986 --> 01:46:49,237
There's champagne.

1124
01:46:50,655 --> 01:46:51,990
You made them?

1125
01:46:52,365 --> 01:46:54,117
- Like it?
- Delicious.

1126
01:46:54,284 --> 01:46:55,619
It's chicken inside?

1127
01:46:56,161 --> 01:46:58,789
There's chicken,
tuna, and shrimp.

1128
01:47:02,876 --> 01:47:05,879
- Good to see you.
- Same here. It's great.

1129
01:47:08,006 --> 01:47:08,882
Soon.

1130
01:47:12,511 --> 01:47:14,638
In two months I've gotten big.

1131
01:47:15,514 --> 01:47:16,598
Come here.

1132
01:47:17,682 --> 01:47:19,184
This is Lise.

1133
01:47:21,686 --> 01:47:23,355
It's nice to see you.

1134
01:47:23,522 --> 01:47:24,689
Want to touch it?

1135
01:47:25,357 --> 01:47:26,358
Go on.

1136
01:47:26,525 --> 01:47:28,527
- You don't mind?
- Not at all.

1137
01:47:29,444 --> 01:47:31,488
- Feel it?
- Yes. Boy or girl?

1138
01:47:31,655 --> 01:47:33,281
I don't want to know.

1139
01:47:33,448 --> 01:47:35,367
To keep it a mystery?

1140
01:47:40,622 --> 01:47:42,415
Does it hurt? Want to sit?

1141
01:47:42,541 --> 01:47:43,708
- I'm fine.
- Sure?

1142
01:47:43,875 --> 01:47:45,293
Playing with baby?

1143
01:47:46,503 --> 01:47:48,547
- Is he the dad?
- Not at all.

1144
01:47:48,713 --> 01:47:50,173
You thought it was him?

1145
01:47:51,133 --> 01:47:52,425
Not him.

1146
01:47:52,551 --> 01:47:53,760
I'm sorry.

1147
01:47:54,344 --> 01:47:55,512
He's an uncle.

1148
01:47:55,679 --> 01:47:56,721
Exactly.

1149
01:47:58,932 --> 01:48:00,725
What you do is really nice.

1150
01:48:01,560 --> 01:48:02,644
What do I do?

1151
01:48:02,769 --> 01:48:03,895
On the paintings.

1152
01:48:04,062 --> 01:48:06,398
Your presence, your poses.
Stunning.

1153
01:48:06,565 --> 01:48:07,774
Thanks. That's nice.

1154
01:48:07,941 --> 01:48:08,942
It's normal.

1155
01:48:09,151 --> 01:48:11,862
It's especially Emma
who did it all.

1156
01:48:12,070 --> 01:48:12,946
Very powerful.

1157
01:48:13,155 --> 01:48:15,198
Joachim, she writes very well.

1158
01:48:15,365 --> 01:48:16,533
Really?

1159
01:48:16,867 --> 01:48:19,327
Can I read your stuff sometime?

1160
01:48:20,120 --> 01:48:21,746
For the time being,

1161
01:48:21,913 --> 01:48:24,332
all I've written is my diary.

1162
01:48:24,499 --> 01:48:25,667
She's shy.

1163
01:48:25,792 --> 01:48:27,544
I want her to write more.

1164
01:48:27,711 --> 01:48:28,962
I see you here

1165
01:48:29,171 --> 01:48:31,882
with a desire to appear on canvas.

1166
01:48:32,090 --> 01:48:35,135
Your writing must be wonderful.
I want to read it.

1167
01:48:36,178 --> 01:48:37,512
Want a drink?

1168
01:48:37,679 --> 01:48:39,264
- A glass.
- Champagne?

1169
01:48:39,431 --> 01:48:40,765
And that painting?

1170
01:48:40,932 --> 01:48:42,601
That last one is amazing.

1171
01:48:50,942 --> 01:48:53,111
First of all,
thanks for being here.

1172
01:48:53,570 --> 01:48:55,155
Thanks for being on time.

1173
01:48:57,782 --> 01:49:00,118
I'd especially like
to thank my muse,

1174
01:49:00,243 --> 01:49:03,205
my source of inspiration
who makes me happy today –

1175
01:49:03,371 --> 01:49:04,289
Adèle.

1176
01:49:05,790 --> 01:49:06,917
Welcome, Adèle!

1177
01:49:09,836 --> 01:49:12,923
I'd also like to say
she did all the cooking.

1178
01:49:16,968 --> 01:49:18,303
Speech!

1179
01:49:19,346 --> 01:49:20,972
It's your turn now.

1180
01:49:21,640 --> 01:49:24,851
I'm really thrilled
to meet you all,

1181
01:49:25,143 --> 01:49:26,811
and I hope you like it.

1182
01:49:28,396 --> 01:49:29,606
Don't cry.

1183
01:49:29,773 --> 01:49:30,815
Cheers.

1184
01:49:30,982 --> 01:49:32,651
Let's have a toast.

1185
01:49:35,737 --> 01:49:36,821
To Adèle!

1186
01:49:37,364 --> 01:49:38,949
To Emma and Adèle!

1187
01:49:39,866 --> 01:49:40,992
To love!

1188
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:50,585
She's in a trance!

1189
01:49:52,254 --> 01:49:53,838
And not even drunk yet!

1190
01:50:02,681 --> 01:50:03,765
Anything else?

1191
01:50:03,890 --> 01:50:05,684
Come sit down a little.

1192
01:50:05,850 --> 01:50:07,018
Join us.

1193
01:50:14,693 --> 01:50:15,902
What do you do?

1194
01:50:16,319 --> 01:50:18,321
I teach nursery school.

1195
01:50:21,324 --> 01:50:22,450
And you?

1196
01:50:24,077 --> 01:50:25,412
I'm doing a Ph.D.

1197
01:50:25,704 --> 01:50:27,998
Both art history
and philosophy.

1198
01:50:28,206 --> 01:50:31,334
I'm doing a Ph.D. on –
You know Egon Schiele?

1199
01:50:33,503 --> 01:50:35,588
- I told you about him.
- Maybe.

1200
01:50:35,714 --> 01:50:36,673
He does nudes,

1201
01:50:36,798 --> 01:50:40,010
emaciated,
in unlikely positions.

1202
01:50:41,094 --> 01:50:44,055
I'm working on morbidity
in Schiele's oeuvre.

1203
01:50:45,390 --> 01:50:47,934
Didn't you show her some stuff?

1204
01:50:48,476 --> 01:50:50,228
Yeah, but I prefer Klimt.

1205
01:50:50,729 --> 01:50:52,647
Klimt is so –

1206
01:50:52,939 --> 01:50:54,733
There's something so...

1207
01:50:54,899 --> 01:50:57,068
florid... decorative.

1208
01:50:57,277 --> 01:51:00,071
Florid and decorative?
You and I can't talk.

1209
01:51:00,947 --> 01:51:03,491
You hate it
when people disagree.

1210
01:51:03,658 --> 01:51:04,909
I like Schiele a lot.

1211
01:51:05,744 --> 01:51:07,495
It's more twisted.

1212
01:51:07,954 --> 01:51:10,081
It's darker, more obscure.

1213
01:51:10,248 --> 01:51:12,542
That's the reason I like Klimt.

1214
01:51:13,084 --> 01:51:14,252
It's that –

1215
01:51:15,587 --> 01:51:17,922
The problem
with that florid stuff –

1216
01:51:18,089 --> 01:51:19,507
It's not florid.

1217
01:51:19,674 --> 01:51:21,509
You can't say it's florid.

1218
01:51:25,513 --> 01:51:26,765
I'm hungry!

1219
01:51:28,683 --> 01:51:29,768
I'm starving.

1220
01:51:31,853 --> 01:51:33,271
Some sauce too.

1221
01:51:37,942 --> 01:51:39,110
Any Parmesan?

1222
01:51:41,905 --> 01:51:43,281
Get in line.

1223
01:51:46,785 --> 01:51:49,079
That's fine.
Perfect. Thank you.

1224
01:51:49,913 --> 01:51:50,914
You're welcome.

1225
01:51:52,665 --> 01:51:53,541
It's so good!

1226
01:51:55,335 --> 01:51:57,796
Adèle, it's out of this world!

1227
01:51:57,962 --> 01:51:58,797
Thank you so much.

1228
01:51:59,339 --> 01:52:00,382
You're welcome.

1229
01:52:03,802 --> 01:52:05,303
- Good?
- Excellent.

1230
01:52:06,388 --> 01:52:09,933
A worm crawls out
of a plate of spaghetti and says,

1231
01:52:10,558 --> 01:52:12,435
"That was some gangbang!"

1232
01:52:12,602 --> 01:52:13,895
How sweet!

1233
01:52:14,145 --> 01:52:16,773
"Sweet" may not be the word.

1234
01:52:17,440 --> 01:52:19,609
What a pleasure to share this.

1235
01:52:19,776 --> 01:52:21,319
Our kind of pleasure.

1236
01:52:22,153 --> 01:52:23,571
Can pleasure be shared?

1237
01:52:25,115 --> 01:52:27,367
We each experience it differently.

1238
01:52:27,534 --> 01:52:28,576
My pleasure

1239
01:52:28,827 --> 01:52:30,537
isn't the same as yours.

1240
01:52:30,787 --> 01:52:33,373
I don't get
the same pleasure as you.

1241
01:52:33,957 --> 01:52:35,417
Find the Parmesan?

1242
01:52:35,583 --> 01:52:38,128
...between the sexes,
a quality of pleasure

1243
01:52:38,336 --> 01:52:39,629
so different

1244
01:52:39,796 --> 01:52:41,840
that we attain differing realities.

1245
01:52:42,006 --> 01:52:43,550
Over and above orgasm.

1246
01:52:44,134 --> 01:52:46,177
I'm curious.
Why do you think that?

1247
01:52:48,346 --> 01:52:49,222
Because –

1248
01:52:49,431 --> 01:52:50,723
We make faces?

1249
01:52:51,641 --> 01:52:54,060
- We make more noise?
- Big difference!

1250
01:52:54,227 --> 01:52:55,979
Something to drink?

1251
01:52:57,355 --> 01:52:59,232
Every time I slept with a woman,

1252
01:52:59,441 --> 01:53:00,942
I noticed something

1253
01:53:01,359 --> 01:53:02,193
that's not –

1254
01:53:02,360 --> 01:53:03,862
She enters another world.

1255
01:53:04,028 --> 01:53:05,029
That's it.

1256
01:53:05,196 --> 01:53:07,490
Orgasm is
an out-of-body experience.

1257
01:53:08,450 --> 01:53:10,160
Our orgasm is limited.

1258
01:53:10,368 --> 01:53:12,871
For you,
female orgasm is mystical.

1259
01:53:13,037 --> 01:53:15,039
I'm totally sure of it.

1260
01:53:15,790 --> 01:53:17,208
Anyone need anything?

1261
01:53:19,669 --> 01:53:21,796
Sit down.
You've been serving everyone.

1262
01:53:21,921 --> 01:53:22,839
Here, eat.

1263
01:53:24,549 --> 01:53:27,427
Relax a little.
You cooked for everyone.

1264
01:53:30,388 --> 01:53:35,018
...insofar as I'm a man,
everything I glimpse is frustrated

1265
01:53:35,185 --> 01:53:37,437
by the limits of male sexuality.

1266
01:53:37,979 --> 01:53:40,899
Even though I've done it
with men and women.

1267
01:53:41,065 --> 01:53:44,861
I remember the story of Tiresias,
who was lucky enough

1268
01:53:45,069 --> 01:53:47,864
to be a man, then a woman,
then a man again.

1269
01:53:48,531 --> 01:53:49,991
When he was asked

1270
01:53:50,116 --> 01:53:53,036
who gets more pleasure,
man or woman,

1271
01:53:53,203 --> 01:53:54,787
he answered categorically

1272
01:53:55,205 --> 01:53:58,124
that women get nine times
more pleasure than men.

1273
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:02,086
Ever since women
have been shown in paintings,

1274
01:54:02,253 --> 01:54:06,883
their ecstasy is shown more than men's,
which is shown via woman.

1275
01:54:07,425 --> 01:54:09,844
We see women bathing, we see –

1276
01:54:10,011 --> 01:54:11,721
<i>The Origin of the World.</i>

1277
01:54:11,888 --> 01:54:14,432
Men try desperately
to depict it.

1278
01:54:15,558 --> 01:54:16,851
Meaning they saw it.

1279
01:54:17,018 --> 01:54:19,270
- Or imagined it.
- Or wished for it.

1280
01:54:19,604 --> 01:54:21,439
It could be their fantasy.

1281
01:54:22,857 --> 01:54:25,610
- So it's based in –
- Look in their eyes.

1282
01:54:25,777 --> 01:54:28,071
That gaze into another world.

1283
01:54:28,238 --> 01:54:31,115
Art by women
never tackles female pleasure.

1284
01:54:31,282 --> 01:54:32,700
Excellent pasta.

1285
01:54:32,867 --> 01:54:34,077
Want some more?

1286
01:54:35,286 --> 01:54:36,913
Yeah, I'd like a little.

1287
01:54:37,247 --> 01:54:39,165
Not too spicy?
You like spicy?

1288
01:54:39,332 --> 01:54:41,251
It's a little spicy.

1289
01:54:41,459 --> 01:54:43,294
But just spicy enough.

1290
01:54:43,586 --> 01:54:45,547
You see, Emma, your paintings

1291
01:54:45,713 --> 01:54:47,799
of Adèle seem to illustrate this.

1292
01:54:47,966 --> 01:54:50,510
I know I'll never experience that,

1293
01:54:50,677 --> 01:54:52,554
because I'll always be a man.

1294
01:54:53,972 --> 01:54:57,141
I love the sauce.
Make it with fresh tomatoes?

1295
01:54:57,308 --> 01:54:58,309
From the market.

1296
01:54:58,518 --> 01:54:59,727
I can tell.

1297
01:55:03,731 --> 01:55:06,401
Had you ever posed before?

1298
01:55:06,526 --> 01:55:07,485
Never.

1299
01:55:07,652 --> 01:55:09,153
It's your first time?

1300
01:55:09,320 --> 01:55:10,655
I don't really pose.

1301
01:55:10,822 --> 01:55:12,073
Just with Emma.

1302
01:55:13,032 --> 01:55:15,535
You seem comfortable
in the paintings.

1303
01:55:15,994 --> 01:55:18,871
Because they were
at times when I –

1304
01:55:18,997 --> 01:55:20,123
I don't know.

1305
01:55:20,290 --> 01:55:22,959
I can't imagine doing it
with someone else.

1306
01:55:23,126 --> 01:55:25,336
I know
it's a stupid question...

1307
01:55:25,628 --> 01:55:28,131
but have you been
with girls for long?

1308
01:55:29,340 --> 01:55:32,802
Is Emma the first,
or were there any before?

1309
01:55:32,969 --> 01:55:34,512
She's the first.

1310
01:55:38,850 --> 01:55:40,101
Is it different?

1311
01:55:40,226 --> 01:55:41,686
- From what?
- Guys.

1312
01:55:42,020 --> 01:55:43,021
Yes.

1313
01:55:44,814 --> 01:55:45,940
A little.

1314
01:55:48,318 --> 01:55:49,944
Is it gentler?

1315
01:55:51,279 --> 01:55:52,655
It depends.

1316
01:55:53,531 --> 01:55:54,616
I have no idea.

1317
01:55:54,949 --> 01:55:56,784
Sorry to ask like this.

1318
01:55:57,577 --> 01:55:59,203
You don't have to answer.

1319
01:55:59,912 --> 01:56:02,040
I don't think I could explain.

1320
01:56:03,625 --> 01:56:04,959
What do you do?

1321
01:56:05,126 --> 01:56:06,961
I teach nursery school.

1322
01:56:07,086 --> 01:56:08,379
You like kids.

1323
01:56:10,256 --> 01:56:11,924
Would you like to have some?

1324
01:56:16,179 --> 01:56:17,555
What do you do?

1325
01:56:18,222 --> 01:56:19,641
I'm an actor.

1326
01:56:19,807 --> 01:56:21,059
I do action movies.

1327
01:56:21,392 --> 01:56:23,227
I did an action movie,

1328
01:56:23,394 --> 01:56:25,188
my first, in the States,

1329
01:56:25,355 --> 01:56:28,399
that I got because I speak Arabic.
They dig that.

1330
01:56:28,608 --> 01:56:29,984
The beard thing.

1331
01:56:30,276 --> 01:56:32,654
We were terrorists, hijackers.

1332
01:56:33,821 --> 01:56:36,074
They love it when we say
<i>Allah al akbar.</i>

1333
01:56:36,240 --> 01:56:37,867
So we did that.

1334
01:56:40,161 --> 01:56:41,287
I'm serious.

1335
01:56:41,829 --> 01:56:44,707
It was fun to see
how the Americans work.

1336
01:56:46,668 --> 01:56:48,044
Where in the States?

1337
01:56:49,712 --> 01:56:52,632
We shot it in a studio in L.A.

1338
01:56:53,466 --> 01:56:55,093
But it took place in New York.

1339
01:56:55,259 --> 01:56:57,595
They rebuilt the city.
It's wild.

1340
01:56:57,762 --> 01:57:01,265
It's like you're walking
down the streets of New York.

1341
01:57:01,974 --> 01:57:04,185
Then I was
in New York on vacation.

1342
01:57:04,310 --> 01:57:06,479
I really, really loved it.

1343
01:57:06,688 --> 01:57:09,607
I'm sure
it's a city you'd adore.

1344
01:57:10,858 --> 01:57:12,610
- I'm dying to go.
- Really?

1345
01:57:12,735 --> 01:57:14,028
So go. Why wait?

1346
01:57:15,738 --> 01:57:17,115
It's a total trip.

1347
01:57:17,281 --> 01:57:18,116
It's amazing.

1348
01:57:18,700 --> 01:57:21,244
It's like walking on a film set.

1349
01:57:21,619 --> 01:57:22,453
I swear.

1350
01:57:22,662 --> 01:57:25,123
Such energy.
Everything seems possible.

1351
01:57:25,289 --> 01:57:26,874
You can do whatever.

1352
01:57:27,208 --> 01:57:29,085
Like there are no barriers.

1353
01:57:30,169 --> 01:57:31,963
There's a huge bug on you.

1354
01:57:34,757 --> 01:57:35,550
What was it?

1355
01:57:35,675 --> 01:57:36,676
I don't know.

1356
01:59:26,619 --> 01:59:28,037
What are you reading?

1357
01:59:28,579 --> 01:59:31,958
A piece on Schiele, the guy
Lucie and I were talking about.

1358
01:59:35,253 --> 01:59:36,963
Your friends are nice.

1359
01:59:37,421 --> 01:59:38,589
They're funny.

1360
01:59:38,756 --> 01:59:40,967
They talk about so much stuff.

1361
01:59:41,133 --> 01:59:43,427
They seem so knowledgeable.

1362
01:59:44,262 --> 01:59:46,430
So cultured.
I felt uncomfortable.

1363
01:59:47,598 --> 01:59:48,808
You were perfect.

1364
02:00:25,678 --> 02:00:27,597
You made a good impression.

1365
02:00:28,681 --> 02:00:30,182
Especially on Joachim.

1366
02:00:31,309 --> 02:00:32,143
Really?

1367
02:00:34,478 --> 02:00:35,897
What does he do?

1368
02:00:37,189 --> 02:00:38,274
I was afraid to ask.

1369
02:00:40,151 --> 02:00:42,987
- Biggest gallery owner in Lille.
- In Lille?

1370
02:00:43,321 --> 02:00:47,116
He's extremely cultured.
A genius. He knows everything.

1371
02:00:47,825 --> 02:00:51,329
He shows only the crème de la crème.
Believe me...

1372
02:00:51,495 --> 02:00:54,332
if he ever shows my work,
I've got it made.

1373
02:00:54,498 --> 02:00:55,958
He'll show your work.

1374
02:00:56,292 --> 02:00:58,169
- Think so?
- Of course.

1375
02:00:58,836 --> 02:01:00,922
He talks about you
as if you were Picasso.

1376
02:01:01,088 --> 02:01:03,549
It's business above all
for those guys.

1377
02:01:03,925 --> 02:01:07,136
- He's your friend. Why wouldn't –
- My friend...

1378
02:01:07,553 --> 02:01:10,348
Our relationship
is mostly professional.

1379
02:01:11,682 --> 02:01:13,476
Not really a friendship.

1380
02:01:14,018 --> 02:01:15,686
But he can change things.

1381
02:01:16,854 --> 02:01:18,105
Just believe in it.

1382
02:01:18,522 --> 02:01:19,857
Knock on wood.

1383
02:01:28,491 --> 02:01:29,909
You should also do

1384
02:01:30,076 --> 02:01:32,078
something you really like.

1385
02:01:33,287 --> 02:01:34,455
I work.

1386
02:01:34,747 --> 02:01:36,582
I know. I don't mean that.

1387
02:01:36,749 --> 02:01:39,251
You write really well, for example.

1388
02:01:39,502 --> 02:01:41,045
Why not write some stuff?

1389
02:01:42,004 --> 02:01:43,714
Even short stories –

1390
02:01:43,923 --> 02:01:46,384
I've always just written for myself.

1391
02:01:47,051 --> 02:01:50,054
It's a shame
to waste your talent like that.

1392
02:01:50,221 --> 02:01:53,891
I write what I feel.
I can't expose my life to the world.

1393
02:01:54,016 --> 02:01:56,268
You can invent rather than expose.

1394
02:01:56,394 --> 02:01:58,270
I don't know how.

1395
02:01:58,562 --> 02:02:01,899
You love inventing stories
and telling them to kids.

1396
02:02:02,400 --> 02:02:03,985
You like doing that.

1397
02:02:04,151 --> 02:02:08,406
But for kids. Constructing
a storyline isn't my thing.

1398
02:02:08,739 --> 02:02:10,366
Anyway, it's up to you.

1399
02:02:11,367 --> 02:02:12,910
I don't know.

1400
02:02:13,327 --> 02:02:15,121
I'd like you to be –

1401
02:02:16,789 --> 02:02:18,416
- Be what?
- I don't know.

1402
02:02:18,582 --> 02:02:20,209
Fulfilled.

1403
02:02:20,376 --> 02:02:22,336
I am fulfilled with you.

1404
02:02:23,504 --> 02:02:26,799
I like it that you're here,
cooking and stuff...

1405
02:02:27,508 --> 02:02:29,427
but I'd like to see you happy.

1406
02:02:29,802 --> 02:02:31,387
I am happy.

1407
02:02:31,929 --> 02:02:34,598
I'm happy with you, like this.

1408
02:02:34,807 --> 02:02:36,517
It's my way of being happy.

1409
02:02:38,227 --> 02:02:39,812
If you say so.

1410
02:02:41,564 --> 02:02:43,649
It hurts when you insist.

1411
02:02:43,816 --> 02:02:44,984
I'm not insisting.

1412
02:02:45,151 --> 02:02:46,610
A little.

1413
02:02:55,995 --> 02:02:57,371
Kiss me.

1414
02:03:01,167 --> 02:03:02,585
A real kiss.

1415
02:03:11,385 --> 02:03:12,636
I want you.

1416
02:03:13,345 --> 02:03:14,430
I can't.

1417
02:03:14,680 --> 02:03:16,057
Why not?

1418
02:03:16,265 --> 02:03:17,641
I'm having my period.

1419
02:03:19,435 --> 02:03:21,270
Why now?

1420
02:03:21,687 --> 02:03:23,647
I don't know. It happens.

1421
02:03:23,773 --> 02:03:24,648
You're early.

1422
02:03:25,024 --> 02:03:27,568
What can I say?
I have no idea.

1423
02:03:36,577 --> 02:03:38,204
Is Lise your ex?

1424
02:03:43,834 --> 02:03:45,461
She paints too.

1425
02:03:47,338 --> 02:03:49,673
<i>Monday is all gray.</i>

1426
02:03:49,840 --> 02:03:52,426
<i>Tuesday, yellow like hay.</i>

1427
02:03:52,593 --> 02:03:55,471
Pink Wednesday,
stay home and play.

1428
02:03:55,638 --> 02:03:57,098
Blue Thursday

1429
02:03:57,264 --> 02:03:58,432
comes our way.

1430
02:03:58,599 --> 02:04:00,684
Thursday green is next seen.

1431
02:04:02,686 --> 02:04:04,146
Friday green!

1432
02:04:05,898 --> 02:04:07,024
Who's first?

1433
02:04:12,113 --> 02:04:14,031
Sana, stand up.

1434
02:04:19,537 --> 02:04:20,704
In the morning?

1435
02:04:21,914 --> 02:04:24,041
We come to school.

1436
02:04:25,126 --> 02:04:27,711
She's telling us
what we do during the day.

1437
02:04:27,878 --> 02:04:29,505
Listen up.

1438
02:04:29,672 --> 02:04:32,466
Stop pinching, Maxence.
Come here.

1439
02:04:33,676 --> 02:04:34,844
Go on, Sana.

1440
02:04:37,721 --> 02:04:39,265
We play.

1441
02:04:40,391 --> 02:04:42,476
After we get here, we play.

1442
02:04:43,394 --> 02:04:45,479
We do our activities. And then?

1443
02:04:46,272 --> 02:04:47,940
We go outside for –

1444
02:04:48,357 --> 02:04:49,817
Recess.

1445
02:04:49,942 --> 02:04:50,943
Then?

1446
02:04:51,068 --> 02:04:52,945
We have gym.

1447
02:04:53,404 --> 02:04:54,780
After gym?

1448
02:04:56,073 --> 02:04:57,449
We take a nap,

1449
02:04:57,575 --> 02:05:01,162
and then we work
with Thérèse and Madame.

1450
02:05:19,972 --> 02:05:21,807
Time to stop talking.

1451
02:05:24,768 --> 02:05:26,604
Do they have everything?

1452
02:05:26,770 --> 02:05:28,522
I had three dollies.

1453
02:05:50,002 --> 02:05:51,837
I can watch them now.

1454
02:05:52,004 --> 02:05:53,380
- Really?
- Sure.

1455
02:05:53,547 --> 02:05:55,007
I'll meet you after.

1456
02:06:25,913 --> 02:06:28,374
<i>One new message.</i>

1457
02:06:31,210 --> 02:06:32,336
<i>Honey, it's me.</i>

1458
02:06:32,503 --> 02:06:36,382
<i>I'm still with Lise, working
on the mock-up I mentioned.</i>

1459
02:06:36,590 --> 02:06:40,010
<i>It's a big job,
and it has to be perfect.</i>

1460
02:06:40,678 --> 02:06:42,596
<i>Don't wait up. I'll be late.</i>

1461
02:06:42,763 --> 02:06:44,848
<i>Call if you want.</i>

1462
02:06:45,849 --> 02:06:47,017
<i>Take care.</i>

1463
02:08:10,726 --> 02:08:12,144
It's hot.

1464
02:10:48,926 --> 02:10:53,096
What's his problem with me?
He has a thing with lesbians!

1465
02:10:54,306 --> 02:10:58,310
I'm happy to explain my paintings,
to say what inspired me,

1466
02:10:58,519 --> 02:11:01,438
but I can't get
into intimate details.

1467
02:11:01,939 --> 02:11:04,608
I don't have to justify who I am.

1468
02:11:04,775 --> 02:11:07,528
There are things
I don't want to tell him!

1469
02:11:17,913 --> 02:11:19,164
I can't sell myself.

1470
02:11:19,331 --> 02:11:22,292
When I see someone
constantly needling me –

1471
02:11:23,293 --> 02:11:25,045
He meant to put me down!

1472
02:11:25,170 --> 02:11:26,672
That's the thing.

1473
02:11:32,719 --> 02:11:34,555
He has to respect my work.

1474
02:11:35,347 --> 02:11:38,892
It's my freedom of expression,
my artistic freedom.

1475
02:11:39,059 --> 02:11:40,602
I can paint what I want!

1476
02:11:41,687 --> 02:11:43,522
You don't want some coffee?

1477
02:11:43,689 --> 02:11:45,107
Too bad if it's no.

1478
02:11:45,232 --> 02:11:47,734
But he can't say,
"I'll buy your painting,

1479
02:11:47,901 --> 02:11:50,320
but accentuate the line...

1480
02:11:50,988 --> 02:11:54,741
or make it blurrier here,
or use this or that color."

1481
02:11:55,158 --> 02:11:56,702
I'm not saying that.

1482
02:11:56,868 --> 02:11:58,579
I'm open to criticism.

1483
02:11:58,745 --> 02:12:00,497
I saw his questions coming.

1484
02:12:00,622 --> 02:12:02,583
How can I answer that?

1485
02:12:07,921 --> 02:12:08,839
Asshole.

1486
02:12:09,339 --> 02:12:10,841
Bread and butter?

1487
02:12:11,300 --> 02:12:14,094
It's crazy.
They don't understand anything.

1488
02:12:15,596 --> 02:12:19,016
There's a fad in painting.
You have to follow it.

1489
02:12:19,182 --> 02:12:20,684
I don't care about fads.

1490
02:12:20,851 --> 02:12:21,852
Want one?

1491
02:12:22,894 --> 02:12:24,396
I don't give a shit.

1492
02:12:24,605 --> 02:12:27,691
People only think
in terms of business.

1493
02:12:27,858 --> 02:12:32,029
They have no –
I don't know how to explain it –

1494
02:12:32,904 --> 02:12:34,364
They have no taste.

1495
02:12:34,531 --> 02:12:36,199
They just have no taste.

1496
02:12:37,409 --> 02:12:39,745
It's normal to be tense at times.

1497
02:12:40,120 --> 02:12:42,372
I get tense with colleagues too.

1498
02:12:47,252 --> 02:12:50,922
Did you put your pacifier
in the binky box?

1499
02:12:59,389 --> 02:13:00,891
Say good-bye to Mommy.

1500
02:13:02,434 --> 02:13:03,852
Thank you. How nice.

1501
02:13:11,401 --> 02:13:12,861
Hang up your coat.

1502
02:13:24,748 --> 02:13:27,292
Luna, go find your name.

1503
02:13:31,296 --> 02:13:32,381
Friends?

1504
02:13:33,173 --> 02:13:35,634
I wore my pants.

1505
02:13:37,260 --> 02:13:39,596
Did you wear your pants?

1506
02:13:39,763 --> 02:13:41,765
I wore this again.

1507
02:14:18,885 --> 02:14:20,137
Thanks a lot.

1508
02:14:57,507 --> 02:14:58,717
Anything wrong?

1509
02:15:02,137 --> 02:15:03,263
I went out

1510
02:15:03,388 --> 02:15:05,056
for a drink with my coworkers.

1511
02:15:05,682 --> 02:15:07,559
After work.
Why didn't you call?

1512
02:15:09,686 --> 02:15:11,396
Did someone drop you off?

1513
02:15:16,026 --> 02:15:17,194
Who?

1514
02:15:18,487 --> 02:15:19,488
A girl from work.

1515
02:15:19,780 --> 02:15:20,947
A girl?

1516
02:15:26,703 --> 02:15:29,372
Why'd she drop you off
down the street?

1517
02:15:31,166 --> 02:15:34,211
I didn't want to say
I went out with a girl.

1518
02:15:34,377 --> 02:15:35,378
Really?

1519
02:15:35,921 --> 02:15:37,714
Why am I whispering?

1520
02:15:38,089 --> 02:15:40,217
You ashamed to be with a girl?

1521
02:15:40,717 --> 02:15:43,178
No, but they don't all
need to know.

1522
02:15:43,345 --> 02:15:45,222
Afterwards they start blabbing.

1523
02:15:48,099 --> 02:15:49,976
You think I'm ashamed?

1524
02:15:53,146 --> 02:15:54,105
Who is he?

1525
02:15:54,648 --> 02:15:55,649
Who?

1526
02:15:55,899 --> 02:15:57,776
The guy who dropped you off.

1527
02:15:59,236 --> 02:16:00,237
Just a coworker.

1528
02:16:01,071 --> 02:16:02,531
You think I'm stupid?

1529
02:16:04,616 --> 02:16:07,285
- Think I didn't see?
- He's a coworker, I swear.

1530
02:16:07,661 --> 02:16:08,703
I saw him.

1531
02:16:08,912 --> 02:16:10,413
We work together.

1532
02:16:10,580 --> 02:16:13,583
Come see.
He's a coworker in another class.

1533
02:16:15,252 --> 02:16:17,087
How long have you been
seeing him?

1534
02:16:20,090 --> 02:16:21,341
Since I started there.

1535
02:16:21,591 --> 02:16:22,801
Really?

1536
02:16:25,178 --> 02:16:27,305
- Why are you lying?
- I'm not.

1537
02:16:28,014 --> 02:16:29,432
So why are you crying?

1538
02:16:30,433 --> 02:16:31,810
I'm not crying.

1539
02:16:32,102 --> 02:16:33,645
Then why the tears?

1540
02:16:35,272 --> 02:16:36,606
I'm tired.

1541
02:16:39,442 --> 02:16:42,237
I'm not dumb. How long
have you been sleeping with him?

1542
02:16:43,738 --> 02:16:45,448
I'm not sleeping with him.

1543
02:16:45,949 --> 02:16:48,326
How long have you been
lying to me?

1544
02:16:50,787 --> 02:16:52,622
I'm not sleeping with him.

1545
02:16:57,752 --> 02:16:59,838
We shared a drunken kiss once.

1546
02:17:00,130 --> 02:17:01,590
So why are you crying?

1547
02:17:01,882 --> 02:17:02,924
I regret it.

1548
02:17:03,049 --> 02:17:03,884
I'm not dumb!

1549
02:17:04,050 --> 02:17:05,468
- I swear.
- Don't lie!

1550
02:17:05,635 --> 02:17:06,177
I swear.

1551
02:17:06,344 --> 02:17:07,971
How long have you been
sleeping with him?

1552
02:17:08,638 --> 02:17:10,473
How many times
have you slept with him?

1553
02:17:10,849 --> 02:17:12,058
Tell me!

1554
02:17:12,767 --> 02:17:15,145
How long have you been
lying to me?

1555
02:17:15,395 --> 02:17:18,690
- Since when do you think I'm dumb?
- I've never thought that.

1556
02:17:18,940 --> 02:17:21,151
Get out of here! Get out.

1557
02:17:21,735 --> 02:17:24,905
I don't want a liar here!
Pack your stuff and go.

1558
02:17:25,071 --> 02:17:26,156
Get going.

1559
02:17:28,116 --> 02:17:29,409
Get lost!

1560
02:17:33,371 --> 02:17:36,333
I slept with him two or three times.
I can't remember.

1561
02:17:37,542 --> 02:17:38,501
Two or three times?

1562
02:17:38,668 --> 02:17:42,005
I didn't tell you because –
I don't know –

1563
02:17:42,505 --> 02:17:45,550
I couldn't explain it.
I knew it was stupid.

1564
02:17:47,177 --> 02:17:49,179
I felt so alone.

1565
02:17:52,933 --> 02:17:54,434
Are you in love?

1566
02:17:54,935 --> 02:17:56,186
Of course not!

1567
02:17:56,353 --> 02:17:58,396
I just felt all alone.

1568
02:17:59,522 --> 02:18:01,775
I never meant to hurt you.

1569
02:18:04,986 --> 02:18:06,029
Fuck.

1570
02:18:06,529 --> 02:18:07,697
I'm sorry.

1571
02:18:09,240 --> 02:18:10,784
It's just that –

1572
02:18:11,201 --> 02:18:12,702
Fuck this!

1573
02:18:15,413 --> 02:18:17,749
He's nothing, just a colleague.

1574
02:18:17,958 --> 02:18:20,043
It was a stupid mistake.

1575
02:18:26,007 --> 02:18:28,760
I swear I never meant
to hurt you.

1576
02:18:28,885 --> 02:18:30,470
I promise I didn't.

1577
02:18:30,637 --> 02:18:32,138
Adèle, stop.

1578
02:18:32,806 --> 02:18:34,265
Wait.

1579
02:18:34,808 --> 02:18:36,184
You hurt me. It's done.

1580
02:18:37,227 --> 02:18:38,687
No, I swear.

1581
02:18:39,020 --> 02:18:41,439
It wasn't on purpose.
There's no reason.

1582
02:18:41,648 --> 02:18:43,233
You're a little slut.

1583
02:18:44,234 --> 02:18:45,485
Little whore.

1584
02:18:45,694 --> 02:18:47,362
You get fucked, right?

1585
02:18:48,279 --> 02:18:49,823
You like that.

1586
02:18:51,282 --> 02:18:53,576
You suck him off in his car
and then kiss me?

1587
02:18:53,743 --> 02:18:55,245
You dare kiss me?

1588
02:18:56,037 --> 02:18:58,248
You dare touch me
and look at me?

1589
02:18:59,457 --> 02:19:01,376
You do stuff like that?

1590
02:19:01,751 --> 02:19:04,587
And then you lie,
you talk bullshit, you talk crap!

1591
02:19:04,754 --> 02:19:05,672
I'm sorry.

1592
02:19:05,839 --> 02:19:07,090
You're a slut!

1593
02:19:07,257 --> 02:19:09,759
I don't know
how to ask for forgiveness.

1594
02:19:10,176 --> 02:19:11,636
There is no forgiveness!

1595
02:19:11,803 --> 02:19:14,597
I never want
to see your face again!

1596
02:19:14,889 --> 02:19:17,100
Pack your bags and get out!

1597
02:19:19,436 --> 02:19:20,979
Get out of my life!

1598
02:19:25,275 --> 02:19:27,527
I wouldn't hurt you
for anything.

1599
02:19:27,736 --> 02:19:29,279
Get out of here.

1600
02:19:29,446 --> 02:19:30,530
Stop it.

1601
02:19:31,489 --> 02:19:34,451
Get out of here now.
Out of my house.

1602
02:19:34,868 --> 02:19:36,536
Pack up and get out.

1603
02:19:37,203 --> 02:19:40,457
I don't want a slut, a whore!
Pack your stuff!

1604
02:19:40,623 --> 02:19:43,084
Let me talk.
He means nothing.

1605
02:19:43,251 --> 02:19:44,210
I won't talk!

1606
02:19:44,335 --> 02:19:46,629
Get the hell out!

1607
02:19:46,755 --> 02:19:49,132
I'm sorry.
I don't know why I did it.

1608
02:19:49,549 --> 02:19:50,675
Take your clothes.

1609
02:19:50,800 --> 02:19:52,218
Let me explain.

1610
02:19:54,637 --> 02:19:55,555
Get lost!

1611
02:19:57,140 --> 02:19:59,142
I never want to see you again!

1612
02:20:00,435 --> 02:20:03,063
Never again.
Get out of my life!

1613
02:20:04,856 --> 02:20:06,900
Think you're the only one
who suffers?

1614
02:20:08,026 --> 02:20:10,195
It was nothing.
Just let me –

1615
02:20:10,320 --> 02:20:12,489
It's too late!

1616
02:20:13,073 --> 02:20:15,492
Take your stuff and get out.

1617
02:20:15,658 --> 02:20:17,160
No sluts here!

1618
02:20:17,744 --> 02:20:19,746
I didn't do anything!

1619
02:20:20,163 --> 02:20:22,082
Stop! I'm not an idiot!

1620
02:20:22,248 --> 02:20:24,584
Don't do this.
Where do I go without you?

1621
02:20:24,751 --> 02:20:26,461
Go see that guy!

1622
02:20:27,170 --> 02:20:29,005
I don't love him!

1623
02:20:29,130 --> 02:20:31,758
It's you I love!
I can't go! What will I do?

1624
02:20:31,925 --> 02:20:34,302
What will I do?
I'm begging you!

1625
02:20:34,469 --> 02:20:36,346
Get out!

1626
02:20:44,896 --> 02:20:46,397
Open the door!

1627
02:20:51,069 --> 02:20:53,279
I'm sorry.
Let me talk to you.

1628
02:20:54,114 --> 02:20:55,115
I'm sorry.

1629
02:20:55,240 --> 02:20:56,991
You're just a whore!

1630
02:21:11,631 --> 02:21:13,508
Leave now, Adèle!

1631
02:22:42,639 --> 02:22:44,474
Did you pick these out?

1632
02:22:44,891 --> 02:22:45,934
So pretty.

1633
02:22:46,226 --> 02:22:48,269
I have so many
I can make a garden.

1634
02:22:48,519 --> 02:22:50,730
It's really nice of you.

1635
02:22:50,980 --> 02:22:52,815
I can't even hold them all.

1636
02:22:53,316 --> 02:22:54,943
Bye-bye, Lili Rose.

1637
02:22:55,652 --> 02:22:57,820
That was a great dance you did.

1638
02:22:58,154 --> 02:22:59,739
Bye-bye, Maxence.

1639
02:23:08,331 --> 02:23:09,540
Enjoy your summer.

1640
02:24:36,377 --> 02:24:37,587
Careful.

1641
02:24:45,178 --> 02:24:47,513
Not in the face or eyes.

1642
02:24:49,932 --> 02:24:52,435
If you get it in her eyes,
no swimming.

1643
02:25:27,428 --> 02:25:29,972
- How's it going?
- Fine.

1644
02:25:33,017 --> 02:25:35,061
Can you watch mine for a minute?

1645
02:25:35,228 --> 02:25:37,105
No problem at all.

1646
02:27:58,955 --> 02:28:01,332
Concentrate on our dictation.

1647
02:28:02,833 --> 02:28:05,169
No drawing on your slates!

1648
02:28:05,336 --> 02:28:07,547
"In the kitchen..."

1649
02:28:08,589 --> 02:28:10,341
Go on.

1650
02:28:12,885 --> 02:28:16,138
"In the kitchen, Mommy..."

1651
02:28:21,644 --> 02:28:23,312
Start with a capital letter.

1652
02:28:24,272 --> 02:28:26,524
"...is peeling...

1653
02:28:30,278 --> 02:28:32,154
an onion."

1654
02:28:33,531 --> 02:28:34,699
Eyes down.

1655
02:28:36,284 --> 02:28:38,953
No need to talk during dictation.

1656
02:28:39,453 --> 02:28:43,541
"In the kitchen, Mommy
is peeling an onion." Period.

1657
02:28:48,963 --> 02:28:52,300
"Laura is playing the violin."

1658
02:28:58,889 --> 02:29:00,349
Is there an O?

1659
02:29:00,766 --> 02:29:03,227
What vowel
is in the word "long"?

1660
02:29:03,519 --> 02:29:05,187
Concentrate.

1661
02:29:06,606 --> 02:29:09,567
Say it again for her.

1662
02:29:16,282 --> 02:29:19,368
Shemzeddine, quiet.
You think I enjoy this?

1663
02:29:27,585 --> 02:29:29,045
Ready?

1664
02:29:29,170 --> 02:29:32,048
If we're behind, it's your fault.

1665
02:29:33,507 --> 02:29:34,342
God bless you.

1666
02:29:34,508 --> 02:29:36,927
You're not concentrating.
You're distracted.

1667
02:29:37,094 --> 02:29:39,847
Dictation is taking an hour.

1668
02:29:40,014 --> 02:29:43,684
We could have done it in 15 minutes
and had time for fun.

1669
02:29:45,269 --> 02:29:48,481
Who sees mistakes in her sentence?
Are there any?

1670
02:29:48,731 --> 02:29:52,276
"In kitchen
Mommy is peeling an onion."

1671
02:29:52,443 --> 02:29:54,153
You forgot the word "the."

1672
02:29:54,320 --> 02:29:57,948
It's not a big mistake.
You just weren't paying attention.

1673
02:29:58,949 --> 02:30:02,328
"In the kitchen
Mommy is peeling an onion."

1674
02:30:02,495 --> 02:30:04,080
How did you spell "onion"?

1675
02:30:05,915 --> 02:30:07,667
How did you spell it?

1676
02:30:08,292 --> 02:30:09,335
It's like this.

1677
02:30:12,546 --> 02:30:14,465
Did anyone spell it right?

1678
02:30:15,299 --> 02:30:16,926
- Me.
- Really?

1679
02:30:18,469 --> 02:30:20,638
Who'll write the next sentence?

1680
02:30:20,930 --> 02:30:22,264
Go ahead, Renda.

1681
02:32:03,365 --> 02:32:04,617
How are you doing?

1682
02:32:23,928 --> 02:32:25,679
It's been too long.

1683
02:32:28,057 --> 02:32:29,308
Sit down.

1684
02:32:42,071 --> 02:32:44,740
- Want something to drink?
- Yeah, sure.

1685
02:32:45,991 --> 02:32:47,535
I got a glass of white.

1686
02:32:47,701 --> 02:32:48,577
I see.

1687
02:32:48,744 --> 02:32:50,746
Taste it. I think you'll like it.

1688
02:32:51,747 --> 02:32:52,998
No thanks, I'm okay.

1689
02:32:53,165 --> 02:32:55,292
- Are you sure?
- No, I'm fine.

1690
02:32:55,709 --> 02:32:58,671
I called your stepdad.
He said you'd like it.

1691
02:33:00,673 --> 02:33:02,007
What do you want?

1692
02:33:04,677 --> 02:33:06,178
I'll have a coffee.

1693
02:33:06,470 --> 02:33:08,681
Excuse me.
A coffee, please.

1694
02:33:15,437 --> 02:33:16,564
You doing well?

1695
02:33:17,022 --> 02:33:18,941
I am. And you?
Are you okay?

1696
02:33:26,448 --> 02:33:28,033
You have a new hairdo.

1697
02:33:31,495 --> 02:33:33,497
It makes me look old.

1698
02:33:34,164 --> 02:33:35,165
Not too much.

1699
02:33:35,583 --> 02:33:37,126
You still look as young.

1700
02:33:37,585 --> 02:33:39,712
It's hard to lose these cheeks.

1701
02:33:40,254 --> 02:33:42,298
I wanted to look more ladylike.

1702
02:33:42,464 --> 02:33:46,468
I changed my hair to be taken
seriously. But apparently...

1703
02:33:46,760 --> 02:33:47,720
I was wrong.

1704
02:33:50,639 --> 02:33:51,765
It looks good.

1705
02:33:52,391 --> 02:33:54,977
You know,
it happens faster than you think.

1706
02:33:55,603 --> 02:33:56,729
Really?

1707
02:34:02,651 --> 02:34:05,654
I've never met anyone
who wanted to look older.

1708
02:34:08,198 --> 02:34:10,367
What about
your shows and stuff?

1709
02:34:10,534 --> 02:34:12,036
Is all that going well?

1710
02:34:12,202 --> 02:34:13,203
It's fine.

1711
02:34:14,163 --> 02:34:15,331
It's all fine.

1712
02:34:16,707 --> 02:34:17,625
Tell me.

1713
02:34:18,042 --> 02:34:19,418
It's a little...

1714
02:34:20,336 --> 02:34:22,755
a little complicated to organize.

1715
02:34:22,963 --> 02:34:25,007
Press, journalists.

1716
02:34:25,633 --> 02:34:27,051
The price of success.

1717
02:34:27,176 --> 02:34:29,511
I see what your fans write
on your site.

1718
02:34:29,762 --> 02:34:31,388
Bunch of dykes.

1719
02:34:32,848 --> 02:34:34,600
Hey, you asked for it.

1720
02:34:41,023 --> 02:34:43,067
I saw your latest paintings.

1721
02:34:43,233 --> 02:34:44,360
Really?

1722
02:34:45,486 --> 02:34:48,113
You blow me away.
It's new, yet it's still you.

1723
02:34:48,280 --> 02:34:50,783
I'm lousy at explaining it.

1724
02:34:51,700 --> 02:34:53,869
I'll buy one
once I have some money.

1725
02:34:54,078 --> 02:34:56,288
Come on, I'll give you one.

1726
02:34:57,414 --> 02:34:58,874
I'll pay you.

1727
02:34:59,792 --> 02:35:01,001
Yes.

1728
02:35:01,335 --> 02:35:02,711
It's important for me.

1729
02:35:02,878 --> 02:35:05,255
I can pay in flesh and blood.

1730
02:35:11,053 --> 02:35:13,222
It was a joke. A bad joke...

1731
02:35:13,389 --> 02:35:14,515
but a joke.

1732
02:35:15,015 --> 02:35:16,225
It was funny.

1733
02:35:18,894 --> 02:35:20,729
And you're doing well?

1734
02:35:21,647 --> 02:35:23,232
Still with my kids.

1735
02:35:23,607 --> 02:35:25,859
I have first-graders now. Older.

1736
02:35:27,027 --> 02:35:28,570
I'm a beginner, but...

1737
02:35:29,113 --> 02:35:31,532
it's great.
Them too, with their ABCs.

1738
02:35:33,409 --> 02:35:34,618
During school break,

1739
02:35:34,743 --> 02:35:38,038
I have a support group
for the ones with problems.

1740
02:35:38,372 --> 02:35:39,707
They're my favorites.

1741
02:35:40,124 --> 02:35:41,917
Very special cases, but...

1742
02:35:42,376 --> 02:35:43,752
they're magical.

1743
02:35:44,378 --> 02:35:46,380
So gratifying
when you can help.

1744
02:35:47,631 --> 02:35:48,882
I'm having a blast.

1745
02:35:49,091 --> 02:35:50,509
They put me to the test,

1746
02:35:50,676 --> 02:35:52,219
push my limits.

1747
02:35:52,344 --> 02:35:54,263
But it's fascinating.

1748
02:35:54,430 --> 02:35:55,889
It's what you wanted.

1749
02:35:56,765 --> 02:35:58,100
Yeah, I think.

1750
02:36:02,104 --> 02:36:03,147
That's good.

1751
02:36:03,313 --> 02:36:04,523
Yeah, it's great.

1752
02:36:04,690 --> 02:36:07,776
But time-consuming.
I have no time for myself.

1753
02:36:08,193 --> 02:36:09,528
You don't go out?

1754
02:36:09,695 --> 02:36:11,905
I do, but with other teachers.

1755
02:36:12,322 --> 02:36:14,950
Nightclubs,
Vieux-Lille, restaurants.

1756
02:36:15,909 --> 02:36:17,077
But...

1757
02:36:18,662 --> 02:36:20,456
I often go home alone.

1758
02:36:20,956 --> 02:36:22,541
I mean, I'm all alone.

1759
02:36:25,127 --> 02:36:26,962
And no boyfriend?

1760
02:36:29,965 --> 02:36:31,216
Girlfriend?

1761
02:36:36,346 --> 02:36:38,390
I had some stupid flings, but...

1762
02:36:38,891 --> 02:36:40,100
nothing concrete.

1763
02:36:40,225 --> 02:36:42,227
Anyway, I have a hard time

1764
02:36:42,478 --> 02:36:43,979
getting attached.

1765
02:36:45,939 --> 02:36:47,816
I can understand.

1766
02:36:47,983 --> 02:36:50,152
It's not easy to be a couple.

1767
02:36:53,447 --> 02:36:56,450
You still with the girl
who was at our place?

1768
02:36:56,617 --> 02:36:57,659
Lise?

1769
02:37:02,623 --> 02:37:03,832
You happy?

1770
02:37:05,167 --> 02:37:06,376
Yeah.

1771
02:37:09,755 --> 02:37:11,340
That's good, then.

1772
02:37:14,259 --> 02:37:15,469
Is she nice?

1773
02:37:15,636 --> 02:37:17,137
Yeah, she's nice.

1774
02:37:17,471 --> 02:37:21,850
I can see her cooking for you
when you get home at night,

1775
02:37:22,017 --> 02:37:24,186
giving you flowers
in the morning.

1776
02:37:24,353 --> 02:37:25,771
That's her style.

1777
02:37:27,314 --> 02:37:29,775
It's especially the kid, Aude...

1778
02:37:30,192 --> 02:37:31,527
that I like a lot.

1779
02:37:31,693 --> 02:37:33,195
Yeah, she has a kid.

1780
02:37:33,362 --> 02:37:34,863
She was very pregnant.

1781
02:37:36,031 --> 02:37:37,950
- How old is she?
- Three.

1782
02:37:38,659 --> 02:37:41,703
I like her a lot. She's funny.
We get along great.

1783
02:37:42,037 --> 02:37:44,039
We clown around together.

1784
02:37:44,790 --> 02:37:46,208
I teach her a lot.

1785
02:37:47,167 --> 02:37:48,627
And Lise yells at us.

1786
02:37:48,794 --> 02:37:50,212
No way.

1787
02:37:51,046 --> 02:37:53,215
Two kids in the house is a lot.

1788
02:37:58,887 --> 02:38:00,764
It's my family.

1789
02:38:17,489 --> 02:38:18,907
And sexually?

1790
02:38:20,742 --> 02:38:21,994
Do you enjoy it?

1791
02:38:28,500 --> 02:38:29,585
It's...

1792
02:38:32,462 --> 02:38:33,463
Lousy?

1793
02:38:34,214 --> 02:38:36,258
It's not lousy, but it's –

1794
02:38:37,509 --> 02:38:38,719
It's boring.

1795
02:38:40,262 --> 02:38:42,431
I don't know, Adèle.

1796
02:38:43,932 --> 02:38:45,684
It's not like with you.

1797
02:38:57,321 --> 02:38:58,697
I miss you.

1798
02:39:01,950 --> 02:39:03,952
I miss touching each other,

1799
02:39:04,286 --> 02:39:07,289
seeing each other,
breathing in each other's scent.

1800
02:39:19,301 --> 02:39:20,928
I want you.

1801
02:39:21,511 --> 02:39:22,846
All the time.

1802
02:39:24,097 --> 02:39:25,933
No one else.

1803
02:39:30,312 --> 02:39:31,772
I miss everything.

1804
02:39:32,314 --> 02:39:34,942
But I have to say,
I miss this a lot.

1805
02:39:43,367 --> 02:39:44,952
Let me touch you.

1806
02:40:09,601 --> 02:40:10,519
Stop.

1807
02:40:10,644 --> 02:40:13,689
Don't say you don't want to.
I don't believe it.

1808
02:40:15,023 --> 02:40:16,817
I know you miss it too.

1809
02:40:22,030 --> 02:40:23,031
Touch.

1810
02:40:59,693 --> 02:41:00,777
Stop it.

1811
02:41:39,566 --> 02:41:41,026
I can't.

1812
02:41:46,365 --> 02:41:48,200
Forgive me. I don't know.

1813
02:41:48,867 --> 02:41:50,118
I don't know.

1814
02:41:53,580 --> 02:41:55,290
It's beyond my control.

1815
02:41:57,250 --> 02:41:58,794
You're forgiven.

1816
02:42:00,879 --> 02:42:02,756
You won't see me anymore?

1817
02:42:07,969 --> 02:42:09,054
No.

1818
02:42:20,941 --> 02:42:22,567
You haven't forgiven me.

1819
02:42:23,652 --> 02:42:25,445
Yes, I have.

1820
02:42:33,995 --> 02:42:35,705
You don't love me anymore.

1821
02:42:58,353 --> 02:42:59,729
Are you sure?

1822
02:43:01,982 --> 02:43:03,191
Yes.

1823
02:43:10,699 --> 02:43:12,701
I'm with someone else now.

1824
02:43:16,705 --> 02:43:18,081
You know that.

1825
02:43:26,214 --> 02:43:28,842
But I feel an infinite
tenderness for you.

1826
02:43:31,761 --> 02:43:33,138
I always will.

1827
02:43:34,347 --> 02:43:36,057
My whole life.

1828
02:44:00,248 --> 02:44:01,750
I'm sorry.

1829
02:44:03,043 --> 02:44:04,628
You know me.

1830
02:44:08,048 --> 02:44:10,091
Sometimes I cry for no reason.

1831
02:44:10,509 --> 02:44:12,552
Yeah, I know you
pretty damn well.

1832
02:44:18,308 --> 02:44:20,435
Happens to me every time.

1833
02:44:21,394 --> 02:44:22,521
I know.

1834
02:44:22,812 --> 02:44:24,648
You're always blubbering.

1835
02:44:29,611 --> 02:44:31,613
Leave whenever you want.

1836
02:44:31,780 --> 02:44:33,323
Yeah, right.

1837
02:44:34,658 --> 02:44:36,034
No, really.

1838
02:44:37,953 --> 02:44:39,704
I won't bother you again.

1839
02:44:41,998 --> 02:44:43,792
You're not bothering me.

1840
02:44:46,503 --> 02:44:47,796
Okay, I'm going.

1841
02:45:11,861 --> 02:45:13,071
Get going.

1842
02:45:14,281 --> 02:45:16,116
Go on, beat it.

1843
02:46:36,946 --> 02:46:39,407
Alexandre, wake up.
You just got here.

1844
02:46:50,794 --> 02:46:53,296
"No Need" by Alain Bosquet.

1845
02:46:53,755 --> 02:46:55,173
Take your time.

1846
02:46:55,340 --> 02:46:58,968
What's the hurry?
Pronounce so we all understand.

1847
02:46:59,344 --> 02:47:02,180
"No Need" by Alain Bosquet.

1848
02:47:02,430 --> 02:47:06,309
"The elephant's trunk

1849
02:47:06,434 --> 02:47:09,854
is for picking up pistachios.

1850
02:47:10,355 --> 02:47:13,274
No need to bend down."

1851
02:47:14,234 --> 02:47:16,569
Adam, can you continue?

1852
02:47:17,529 --> 02:47:19,155
You know where we are?

1853
02:47:19,864 --> 02:47:21,741
"The giraffe's neck is –"

1854
02:47:21,866 --> 02:47:24,744
Louder, please.
Start from the beginning.

1855
02:47:25,370 --> 02:47:28,957
"The giraffe's neck
is for grazing on the stars.

1856
02:47:29,124 --> 02:47:30,875
No need to fly."

1857
02:47:31,042 --> 02:47:32,127
Very good.

1858
02:47:33,712 --> 02:47:34,713
Prune?

1859
02:47:35,046 --> 02:47:36,881
"The chameleon's skin,

1860
02:47:37,048 --> 02:47:39,092
green, blue, purple, white,

1861
02:47:39,259 --> 02:47:41,636
is for hiding from animals.

1862
02:47:41,886 --> 02:47:43,555
No need to run away."

1863
02:47:45,306 --> 02:47:46,391
Wassila?

1864
02:47:47,142 --> 02:47:51,438
"The poem of the poet
is to say all this

1865
02:47:51,604 --> 02:47:54,399
and thousands and thousands
of other things.

1866
02:47:54,524 --> 02:47:56,151
No need to understand."

1867
02:49:23,696 --> 02:49:26,908
I can't believe she came.
It's been ages.

1868
02:49:33,706 --> 02:49:36,501
Myrième, exactly.
I haven't seen you in ages.

1869
02:49:37,585 --> 02:49:41,339
What a pretty dress.
I love the color blue.

1870
02:49:41,881 --> 02:49:43,091
Thanks.
That's nice of you.

1871
02:49:43,216 --> 02:49:44,509
Can I ask you something?

1872
02:49:44,676 --> 02:49:47,595
My nephew, Nicolas Rouillard.
Ring a bell?

1873
02:49:47,804 --> 02:49:50,640
He said his teacher
was named Adèle. You?

1874
02:49:51,057 --> 02:49:53,226
Seriously. What's he like?

1875
02:49:53,393 --> 02:49:54,644
Adorable.

1876
02:49:55,103 --> 02:49:56,187
My sister's son.

1877
02:49:56,312 --> 02:49:59,399
I wanted you to give me
the scoop on him.

1878
02:49:59,524 --> 02:50:00,400
How funny.

1879
02:50:00,525 --> 02:50:02,861
Is he a good worker?
Really?

1880
02:50:03,194 --> 02:50:04,279
A sweetheart.

1881
02:50:07,448 --> 02:50:09,868
I'm going to go mingle.
We'll talk later.

1882
02:50:10,034 --> 02:50:11,286
See you.

1883
02:50:12,328 --> 02:50:13,454
Are you okay?

1884
02:50:14,247 --> 02:50:15,331
And you?

1885
02:50:16,082 --> 02:50:17,709
How did you get here?

1886
02:50:18,001 --> 02:50:19,460
By foot. I live nearby.

1887
02:50:20,795 --> 02:50:22,130
Nice neighborhood.

1888
02:50:25,133 --> 02:50:26,009
Welcome.

1889
02:50:27,051 --> 02:50:28,303
Thanks for inviting me.

1890
02:50:29,304 --> 02:50:30,471
It's normal.

1891
02:50:31,014 --> 02:50:34,225
So here are my paintings.

1892
02:50:34,726 --> 02:50:38,021
And behind you is a painter
named Adé Bernard.

1893
02:50:38,146 --> 02:50:39,147
Okay.

1894
02:50:42,108 --> 02:50:43,818
That one is awesome.

1895
02:50:45,653 --> 02:50:46,863
It's amazing.

1896
02:50:47,030 --> 02:50:47,947
Really.

1897
02:50:48,448 --> 02:50:50,033
Everything.

1898
02:50:52,827 --> 02:50:54,829
Hello. How are you?

1899
02:50:55,580 --> 02:50:56,915
Remember me?

1900
02:50:57,373 --> 02:51:00,335
We love it,
but we have a few questions.

1901
02:51:00,501 --> 02:51:02,337
That's why I'm here.

1902
02:51:03,171 --> 02:51:04,297
Excuse me.

1903
02:51:05,006 --> 02:51:07,926
I see old Emma, new Emma,
blue and red.

1904
02:51:08,092 --> 02:51:09,302
The life bearer.

1905
02:51:09,844 --> 02:51:11,763
She seems totally at peace,

1906
02:51:11,971 --> 02:51:16,267
yet there's something
troubling in her eyes.

1907
02:51:16,935 --> 02:51:19,812
I like it. I was wondering
what she's thinking.

1908
02:51:21,856 --> 02:51:24,525
There's an incipient
happiness, but also

1909
02:51:24,692 --> 02:51:26,069
a lot of anguish.

1910
02:51:27,153 --> 02:51:30,406
Her gaze is absent,
yet it seems to beckon us

1911
02:51:30,782 --> 02:51:32,408
amid all the colors.

1912
02:51:32,700 --> 02:51:33,701
I'll be right back.

1913
02:51:33,910 --> 02:51:35,370
We'll talk afterwards.

1914
02:51:35,912 --> 02:51:37,622
Sarah went to Beaux Arts too.

1915
02:51:38,998 --> 02:51:40,708
I love what you do.

1916
02:51:40,875 --> 02:51:44,629
I feel a passion, a movement...

1917
02:51:45,088 --> 02:51:46,506
in the lines.

1918
02:51:46,714 --> 02:51:48,049
Too much talk.

1919
02:51:48,216 --> 02:51:50,009
What a pickup artist.

1920
02:51:55,223 --> 02:51:56,516
It's nice to see you.

1921
02:51:57,058 --> 02:51:58,518
How do you like it?

1922
02:52:00,436 --> 02:52:01,980
It's breathtaking.

1923
02:52:02,230 --> 02:52:04,399
And Joachim's showing her work.

1924
02:52:04,524 --> 02:52:08,069
When I got the invitation,
I thought of you both.

1925
02:52:08,361 --> 02:52:10,029
She really wanted it.

1926
02:52:11,906 --> 02:52:13,449
It was perfect timing.

1927
02:52:13,825 --> 02:52:15,076
It's really good.

1928
02:52:17,954 --> 02:52:20,206
And you see... you're still here.

1929
02:52:26,629 --> 02:52:28,381
It's nice to see.

1930
02:52:30,758 --> 02:52:31,718
See you later.

1931
02:52:31,843 --> 02:52:33,052
Sure thing.

1932
02:53:07,128 --> 02:53:08,296
You doing okay?

1933
02:54:03,768 --> 02:54:04,852
How are you?

1934
02:54:05,019 --> 02:54:06,104
Yeah, great.

1935
02:54:06,854 --> 02:54:08,022
Good to see you.

1936
02:54:08,189 --> 02:54:09,190
Same here.

1937
02:54:12,110 --> 02:54:14,195
Are you still in movies?

1938
02:54:14,987 --> 02:54:16,322
Real estate now.

1939
02:54:17,573 --> 02:54:20,535
I'm still doing movies,
but very little.

1940
02:54:21,536 --> 02:54:24,705
I was sick of...
rubbing everyone the right way.

1941
02:54:24,872 --> 02:54:26,707
Ball-busting directors.

1942
02:54:27,875 --> 02:54:28,751
It was a pain.

1943
02:54:28,960 --> 02:54:31,254
Better to be a hypocritical salesman.

1944
02:54:32,839 --> 02:54:34,048
Like the show?

1945
02:54:34,590 --> 02:54:37,385
Not bad.
It's not really my thing.

1946
02:54:40,513 --> 02:54:42,223
You're still as beautiful.

1947
02:54:43,099 --> 02:54:44,058
Think so?

1948
02:54:44,225 --> 02:54:45,393
Even in real life.

1949
02:54:47,854 --> 02:54:49,772
That makes you laugh?

1950
02:54:50,064 --> 02:54:51,899
At least you're smiling again.

1951
02:54:55,486 --> 02:54:58,197
It's not that hard seeing Emma?

1952
02:54:58,573 --> 02:55:00,741
Things are settled between us.

1953
02:55:00,908 --> 02:55:02,535
As long as they're settled.

1954
02:55:08,499 --> 02:55:10,251
You ever get to New York?

1955
02:55:11,586 --> 02:55:12,795
Not yet.

1956
02:55:13,379 --> 02:55:14,755
Traveling opens your mind.

1957
02:55:15,590 --> 02:55:17,091
Yeah, I know.

1958
02:55:18,759 --> 02:55:20,178
Let me steal him.

1959
02:55:20,344 --> 02:55:21,971
Come on.
- One sec.

1960
02:55:43,117 --> 02:55:44,368
It was great.

1961
02:55:52,376 --> 02:55:53,961
I saw you in a movie.

1962
02:55:54,128 --> 02:55:56,130
Acting suited you.
- Really?
