1
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,008
I was scared…

2
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:53,344
of this baby

3
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:56,264
that I brought into this world too soon.

4
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:01,770
And of myself
for having to make this decision.

5
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:11,196
I was scared of it all.

6
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:33,134
I couldn't bring myself to kill you.

7
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:36,513
So I abandoned you.

8
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,959
I thought I could move on.

9
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:01,598
Hyun-su!

10
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:29,751
But then I wanted to know…

11
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:33,421
why you were born this way.

12
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:40,428
Perhaps it was my fault
for not bearing you for long enough.

13
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:58,821
Or maybe it was my own filthy desires

14
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:02,533
that turned you into who you are.

15
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:29,894
What is my child?

16
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,898
Is she a gift or a curse?

17
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,693
I couldn't figure it out.

18
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,494
I thought…

19
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:50,123
you might have the answer.

20
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:02,260
I came too late, didn't I?

21
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:06,889
No.

22
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:11,394
I'm glad you're here.

23
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:18,484
Say hi.

24
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:19,610
She's your mom.

25
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:35,585
Hi.

26
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:51,976
You seemed perfectly normal.

27
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:55,772
What a relief that was.

28
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:43,986
Every single day I spent with you,
hiding my disquiet…

29
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:52,286
Every single ordinary day
that had me on thin ice…

30
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:17,145
I thought this life

31
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,564
might not be so bad.

32
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:28,448
I thought I had lost you.

33
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:37,665
But you suddenly stopped writhing in pain…

34
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:47,133
and stood before me
as a completely different being.

35
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,760
That's when I realized…

36
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:02,773
that no matter how much I denied it,

37
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:06,277
my child was a monster.

38
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,397
What's going on?

39
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:55,743
Do you have to go this far?

40
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:58,913
I'm her mom.

41
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,707
No matter how much she grows

42
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,584
or what she becomes,

43
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,129
I have to be able to recognize her.

44
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:11,342
I'll never lose her.

45
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,080
I don't know if I'm trying to
protect you from the world

46
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:45,876
or the world from you.

47
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,963
Don't ever take them off.

48
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:51,716
I'm just…

49
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,428
trying to be with you.

50
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:57,471
Okay?

51
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,744
ORIGINAL STORY WEBTOON SWEET HOME
BY CARNBY KIM AND YOUNGCHAN HWANG

52
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:55,946
SWEET HOME

53
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,914
Mom…

54
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:08,334
People…

55
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:11,337
They're all bad.

56
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:13,881
"Mom"?

57
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:15,549
You're just like them.

58
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,218
Cha Hyun-su.

59
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:03,639
Cha Hyun-su!

60
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:15,609
Are you really going to leave like this?

61
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:18,988
Did you expect a warm greeting?

62
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,905
Yes.

63
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,576
You should at least ask me how I've been.

64
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:25,911
I'm just not interested.

65
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,041
Was it you all along?

66
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,963
It was you who helped me
at the construction site, wasn't it?

67
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:41,510
You lead me on with this crap,

68
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,722
and now you're trying to run away?

69
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,308
Say something.

70
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:49,560
What?

71
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:51,770
Are you going to run away again?

72
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,564
Like an idiot?

73
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,361
I just happened to be there.

74
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:02,698
And I only helped you because I knew you.

75
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:08,412
You're alive.

76
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:11,790
Isn't that enough?

77
00:13:58,462 --> 00:13:59,964
Do you have a death wish?

78
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:03,342
What the hell are you doing here,
you half-monster?

79
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:12,226
Get lost.

80
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,042
You idiot.

81
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:39,920
Even Ha-ni values her own life.

82
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,883
Why would you chase
a monster around, of all things?

83
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,511
Be thankful that you're alive.

84
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,475
Thank god.

85
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:57,980
He's been holding on.

86
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:00,190
He's alive.

87
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,036
If you're going to
mess around with monsters

88
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,913
and bring them to our shelter,

89
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:16,707
you can get lost too.

90
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,765
-Why did you do that?
-Because I don't like her.

91
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,267
And why not?

92
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:38,938
You keep hurting my friends
and vanishing because of her!

93
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,733
Because you want to protect her.

94
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:44,985
I don't trust you anymore.

95
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,161
At first…

96
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,748
I was curious about humans.

97
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:59,124
They're like Mom.

98
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:04,421
So I approached them…

99
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:07,007
but they only hurt me.

100
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,594
They screamed, pushed me away,

101
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:13,305
and hurt me.

102
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,308
They burned all my friends!

103
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,230
They force me to be alone.

104
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:26,610
They're just scared…

105
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:32,241
that they'll lose someone precious.

106
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:36,620
I'm going to do the same to them.

107
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,168
I'll make them pay for what they did.

108
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:48,799
It's your turn to feel what I felt.

109
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:53,053
Then you might finally understand…

110
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,097
my pain.

111
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:03,105
That's what I came to tell you.

112
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:09,445
Let's go home.

113
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:12,072
Please?

114
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,704
We have no home.

115
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:21,749
It's being burned down.

116
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:15,636
Now…

117
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,430
I don't need you

118
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:20,557
or Mom.

119
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,188
Yi-kyung!

120
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,191
Where are you?

121
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:50,457
Yi-kyung…

122
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:23,907
Hyun-su.

123
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:27,703
Yi-kyung, are you okay?

124
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:31,123
I ruined everything.

125
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:34,918
I wanted her to grow up to be like you.

126
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:41,425
That's all I wanted.

127
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,177
It's not your fault.

128
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:58,900
I should've killed her.

129
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:03,280
I always had that in mind raising her.

130
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:05,240
I'm sure…

131
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:09,411
she knew how I felt.

132
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:12,414
No.

133
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,542
I watched you raise her.

134
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:19,796
I saw how you endured everything.

135
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,174
It's all my fault.

136
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:27,346
I made all of this mess.

137
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:31,224
This is for the better.

138
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:35,520
Maybe it's best that I die here.

139
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:39,024
Then I won't have to…

140
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:44,321
kill her with my own hands.

141
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:50,118
Were you really going to kill her?

142
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:54,164
Why? You're her mom.

143
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,208
So why?

144
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:57,751
I don't deserve to be a mom.

145
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:01,922
I thought about it hundreds of times.

146
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:08,512
"Why was my child born this way?"

147
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,516
"It's my fault."

148
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:14,976
"My desires…

149
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:17,729
turned her…

150
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,108
into…

151
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:26,029
a monster."

152
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,448
What's wrong with that?

153
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,369
It's not a crime to be a monster.

154
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:43,797
Mommy…

155
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,385
This one protected you.

156
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:51,763
It considered you family.

157
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:54,891
Monsters can feel

158
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,227
and recognize faces too.

159
00:23:58,353 --> 00:23:59,938
They were once human.

160
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:12,617
Mommy…

161
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,580
Mommy…

162
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:44,691
What's wrong with him?

163
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:47,903
Open your eyes.

164
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,031
What the hell are you doing?

165
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:53,408
I think he's dead, boss.

166
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:56,536
What's going on?

167
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,542
He was fine earlier. What happened?

168
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:04,252
He's been poisoned.

169
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:07,130
How much did you give him?

170
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:09,299
That much.

171
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:10,800
Just one bowl.

172
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:12,969
You gave all of that to him?

173
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,397
What the hell is this?

174
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:25,440
Poisonous mushrooms.

175
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:27,901
Ones that cause hallucinations.

176
00:25:28,526 --> 00:25:30,320
She's got tolerance, so she's fine.

177
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:33,949
But he needs an antidote.

178
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:36,034
Hey!

179
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:40,288
Hey, wake up!

180
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,805
What a jerk.

181
00:25:58,848 --> 00:26:00,892
How could he disappear again?

182
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:07,107
First, he hurts me
by enlisting without telling me.

183
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:11,111
And now he makes me cry
because of another girl?

184
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:15,907
PARK CHAN-YEONG

185
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:17,867
I'm done with him.

186
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:23,123
I'll take that if you don't want it.

187
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,378
Damn it.

188
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:33,550
Do you know how valuable this is?

189
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:35,468
There's a whole pile of them over there.

190
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:36,803
They're totally different.

191
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:41,016
Chan-yeong gave this to me
with his autograph.

192
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:43,727
You threw it,
so I thought you didn't want it.

193
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:47,647
So annoying.

194
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:51,943
-Are you ready?
-For what?

195
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:53,153
Are you going somewhere?

196
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:56,406
We're meeting
Father Peter today, remember?

197
00:26:57,073 --> 00:26:58,825
I'm not in the mood for that.

198
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:01,328
Let's go. I don't want to go alone.

199
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:07,125
Let me come with you, Sarge.

200
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:08,043
No.

201
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:10,587
It's a personal matter.

202
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:13,173
How is Yong-seok a personal matter?
You're being too reckless.

203
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:15,175
Stop being so dramatic.

204
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,094
Report on my behalf tomorrow.

205
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,555
Tell him I'll be back with Yong-seok.

206
00:27:20,638 --> 00:27:22,015
I can't do that, sir.

207
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:26,394
I'm sorry, Sarge.

208
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:29,564
I had to protect you.

209
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:36,863
I heard you got a signal from Bamseom.

210
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,159
Yes, sir.

211
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:42,577
Will you be okay on your own?

212
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,412
Take some of them with you.

213
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:49,626
What made you suddenly change your mind?

214
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,171
We're going the same way,
so let me join you.

215
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:00,595
I don't care what you think.

216
00:28:00,678 --> 00:28:04,641
Just focus on coming back alive.

217
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:07,268
I'm going too.

218
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:09,687
Yong-seok is my subordinate and my friend.

219
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:13,400
You should stay, Min.

220
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:14,317
Kim Yeong-hu.

221
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:16,778
Didn't you say we were all family?

222
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:19,781
Are you really going to leave me out?

223
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:20,698
Look, man.

224
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,577
Who's going to lead the men
if both of us get killed?

225
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:26,746
They need you here.

226
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,252
Seo-jin.

227
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:35,672
I'll bring him back.

228
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:41,636
Just trust me.

229
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:43,430
I do.

230
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,683
You were better than me at everything.

231
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:48,977
But I just get this feeling

232
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,730
that I have to go myself.

233
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:55,191
I can't sit around here
after sending you off.

234
00:28:57,485 --> 00:28:58,737
Take me with you, Yeong-hu.

235
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:00,655
Here's the thing.

236
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:04,200
If something happened
to you guys or Yong-seok,

237
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:06,536
I'd be useless anyway.

238
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:12,292
No need to get all serious.

239
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:14,502
I'm going if you guys are.

240
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,004
I'll come with you.

241
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,382
Anyone else cringing?

242
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:20,800
Look at these goosebumps.

243
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:22,177
Let's get going!

244
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,053
Wait, I can't drive
with my hand all screwed up.

245
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:26,306
Come on, everyone.

246
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:31,936
I can't see anything
with these on at night.

247
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:33,938
Let's go.

248
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:04,969
Aren't you coming?

249
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:12,143
What's wrong? You're so quiet today.

250
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,856
I can't stand this.

251
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,775
-Let's have a drink.
-What?

252
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:32,247
Could you at least be discreet?

253
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:34,207
Just let me have this.

254
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:35,583
I'll pay you back.

255
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:38,086
Got any extras?

256
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:40,421
Sure, whatever.

257
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:56,396
So…

258
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:58,815
are you going to go out with her or not?

259
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:02,610
Stop it.
He's a priest, for crying out loud.

260
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,362
What? I'm not saying he should marry her.

261
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:05,989
He can still go on dates.

262
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:08,408
You've had enough.

263
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:10,743
Wait.

264
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:13,371
What's going on between you two?

265
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:14,873
Are you guys dating?

266
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:16,624
Are you playing with Seon-hwa?

267
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:17,959
You're drunk. Get out.

268
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:23,631
Men are all cowards.

269
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:25,967
That's why you're not getting any.

270
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:30,138
Any man would run away
if you acted that way.

271
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:32,015
What did you say, bitch?

272
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:33,057
Hey!

273
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,475
You don't know shit.

274
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,102
What do you know about love?

275
00:31:57,832 --> 00:31:59,792
I thought I was turning into a monster.

276
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:02,003
I thought I was hearing things.

277
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:03,671
Don't say such a thing.

278
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:06,007
We recently had an incident.

279
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:08,927
Goodness.

280
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:12,931
I haven't heard
the sound of music for so long.

281
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:15,266
Father.

282
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,393
You're quite resourceful, aren't you?

283
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:19,270
It's not free.

284
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:21,522
You have to confess to drink this.

285
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:23,399
You didn't come to today's meeting.

286
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:25,777
Come on, don't be like that.

287
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,946
Couldn't you at least bring something?

288
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:37,747
What?

289
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:40,249
Greed can make you a monster, you know.

290
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:42,377
Sharing is caring.

291
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,587
Turning into a monster wouldn't be so bad.

292
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:46,381
You'd live longer.

293
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:49,300
You wouldn't be sick

294
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:52,261
or scared.

295
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:57,433
-Come on.
-True.

296
00:32:57,517 --> 00:33:00,895
Then again, life here may be fucked up,

297
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,563
but I'm not alone.

298
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:05,692
I'd be happy as long as I'm not a monster.

299
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:09,195
I want nothing more than that.

300
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:11,948
I want to leave as soon as possible.

301
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:15,702
I have so many things
I want to show and teach,

302
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:17,954
but it's not easy to do here.

303
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:21,708
What about you, Father?

304
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:24,127
Tell us about yourself.

305
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,421
You never talk about yourself.

306
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:27,380
She's right.

307
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:29,799
Let's hear it.

308
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:32,969
My life isn't too different
from what it used to be.

309
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:36,389
I have nowhere to go back to.

310
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:43,187
I love it.

311
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:46,274
I love how the world is in ruins.

312
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:52,780
Everyone can get along
because we're all the same.

313
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:55,366
I'm not lonely anymore.

314
00:33:58,703 --> 00:33:59,912
You were homeless, weren't you?

315
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:01,539
I'm rich.

316
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:02,665
Bullshit.

317
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:04,208
No rich person would say that.

318
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:08,087
Why would you love it now
when you lost everything?

319
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:09,672
Man, this is depressing.

320
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:11,632
Screw it.

321
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:13,634
I, Jung Ye-seul,

322
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:16,429
will lighten up the mood.

323
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:17,889
Come on.

324
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:19,557
All right!

325
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:58,930
I should change the sign.

326
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:39,804
You seem happy.

327
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:43,057
You may take it for granted
since you're out and about all the time

328
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,184
but try living underground for a year.

329
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:50,148
Everything will seem new.

330
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:52,150
Not everyone is like you.

331
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,943
People are usually afraid.

332
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:57,071
What's with the suitcase?

333
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:02,326
It's a secret box.

334
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,703
What's inside it?

335
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:05,121
Don't you know what "secret" means?

336
00:36:05,204 --> 00:36:07,707
It's a secret
because I don't know what will be in it.

337
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:18,926
Stop!

338
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:21,012
Stop!

339
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:23,264
Stop!

340
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:27,018
No. Stop!

341
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:29,812
Stop!

342
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,190
Oh, no.

343
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:35,109
No.

344
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:37,695
Stop!

345
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:41,032
What is it?

346
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:42,283
I have a stomachache.

347
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,328
We're almost there.

348
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:47,163
I think I have to go right now.

349
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:48,915
It won't take long.

350
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:52,752
-Hey, Jong-hyun!
-Yes, sir.

351
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:54,086
Follow him.

352
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:55,880
Damn it.

353
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:02,011
Why are you taking that with you?

354
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:03,804
I don't know what might be there.

355
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:25,993
Jong-hyun, are you still waiting?

356
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:28,120
He must've held it in for a long time.

357
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:29,622
What did he even eat?

358
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:30,581
Stay alert.

359
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:32,541
Of course, sir.

360
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:50,226
Movement up ahead.

361
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,228
Please prepare to cover.

362
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:53,145
Roger.

363
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:56,315
Seo-jin, do you have visual?

364
00:37:58,192 --> 00:37:59,443
I don't see anything.

365
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:02,989
-Seok-chan, get ready.
-Yes, sir.

366
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:10,413
Don't touch it…

367
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:15,835
I wiped.

368
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:23,884
What's that?

369
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:37,315
-Ditch that thing.
-No.

370
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:39,817
Absolutely not.

371
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:48,951
Fuck.

372
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:51,412
Run!

373
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:16,812
This is so damn heavy!

374
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:19,023
God damn it.

375
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:56,185
Run!

376
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:47,069
-Don't take it out on the case.
-Fuck this shit.

377
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:48,696
-Take it out on me.
-I swear I'll kill you.

378
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:50,573
What the hell is in there?
I almost broke my shoulders.

379
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:53,033
Maybe you should've worked out more.

380
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,327
Are you hiding something?

381
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,329
I'm not hiding anything.

382
00:40:58,038 --> 00:40:59,623
Check the bag, Jong-hyun.

383
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:01,625
Wait, don't touch it!

384
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:05,713
For fuck's sake.

385
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:08,424
I said we should throw it away!

386
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:12,303
Sergeant Min,
you get scared pretty easily.

387
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:13,512
It's dead anyway.

388
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:14,680
That's what I'm saying.

389
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:17,057
Why are you bagging a dead monster?

390
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:19,727
Are you opening a monster museum?

391
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,770
-I've never seen this one before.
-Damn it.

392
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:24,148
Did you notice anything different

393
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:26,734
about those monsters back there?

394
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:31,864
Monsters don't recognize each other.

395
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:34,408
They have never teamed up

396
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:36,785
and gone after a single target.

397
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:38,621
-But this time?
-He's right.

398
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:41,081
It was as if they were all waiting for us.

399
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:42,708
They were working together.

400
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:45,044
Are you saying
they were trying to ambush us?

401
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,672
Or maybe they were
trying to protect something.

402
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:02,955
God damn it.

403
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:09,587
What's that?

404
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:28,147
It's bitter, but keep chewing on it.

405
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:30,357
I'm not eating it.

406
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:31,984
I'm not eating anything you give me.

407
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:35,738
Take him somewhere else.
He'll be dead soon.

408
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:43,329
Is this an antidote?

409
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:48,208
You have to tell me what it is
before I give it to him.

410
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:52,296
You think I'd give a dying man
something inedible?

411
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:00,929
Chew it.

412
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:04,224
Shut up and chew.

413
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:24,763
Let's go.

414
00:45:27,724 --> 00:45:29,643
It's been exactly a year.

415
00:45:29,726 --> 00:45:30,769
Wait up.

416
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:33,480
It's only been a year.

417
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:37,109
This is hardly an island anymore.

418
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:39,486
Nature is adapting to this disaster.

419
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:43,157
What do you mean, sir?

420
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:45,659
With humans out of the way,

421
00:45:45,742 --> 00:45:47,536
it's going back to the way it was.

422
00:46:37,794 --> 00:46:38,712
Clear.

423
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:52,559
-Seok-chan.
-Yes, sir.

424
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:54,520
Does that help?

425
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:56,772
I need something to lean on.

426
00:46:58,398 --> 00:46:59,733
We'll be okay, right?

427
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:02,653
Why ask me?

428
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:04,279
Ask the one you believe in.

429
00:47:06,448 --> 00:47:08,408
That's why I'm asking you.

430
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:13,664
Shut up, you idiot.

431
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:17,876
You're with me, Dr. Lim.

432
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:19,586
Seok-chan, on me.

433
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,004
Yes, sir. Of course.

434
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:22,839
I thought we were all staying together.

435
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:25,425
I'm kind of scared.

436
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:26,927
I've got sins to pay for.

437
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:31,265
Seo-jin, take the rest
and look for Yong-seok.

438
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:32,182
Okay.

439
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:33,850
Let's join up once we're done.

440
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,519
Hey, Seo-jin.

441
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:40,274
Try to come back in one piece.

442
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:44,570
Go.

443
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:52,494
Where do we go?

444
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:53,704
To my sector.

445
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:55,372
Research facility?

446
00:47:57,332 --> 00:47:59,001
Are you a good fighter, Sergeant Kim?

447
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:01,044
You good at killing monsters?

448
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:02,629
You better be.

449
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,548
I'm not sure what's in there either.

450
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:06,091
Let's go.

451
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:27,529
It's the same drawing every time.

452
00:48:28,113 --> 00:48:30,198
Yes. It's my house.

453
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:34,244
When will they send us home?
I want to go home.

454
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:35,370
Later.

455
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:37,789
Not now, but later.

456
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:40,292
How long do I have to wait?

457
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:41,918
You can't go home.

458
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:44,087
Yeong-su.

459
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:46,632
It's all a lie.

460
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:49,217
What if we become monsters
like Jun-il's mom?

461
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:52,179
Bad boy, Yeong-su.

462
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:54,473
You shouldn't be a good person either.

463
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:56,099
You might end up dying.

464
00:48:56,808 --> 00:48:58,060
-Kim Yeong-su.
-Don't touch me!

465
00:48:58,644 --> 00:49:00,395
Who are you to scold me?

466
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:01,980
You're not even my real mom!

467
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:10,113
Why do you keep that brat with you?

468
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:15,410
I'm already at my limit.
Don't get on my nerves.

469
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:20,374
I don't think there's anything over there.

470
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:21,667
You think?

471
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:25,420
I just hope some monster
doesn't show up out of nowhere.

472
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:28,757
-What do you mean?
-Don't you know?

473
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:31,385
You could break a ceiling down
looking for an ant colony.

474
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:34,638
Even a small house has surprises,
and this place is huge.

475
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:36,056
Who knows what could be here?

476
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:37,808
Come on, you're exaggerating.

477
00:49:37,891 --> 00:49:40,894
We'll get a little extra something
if we work hard.

478
00:49:47,275 --> 00:49:48,360
Are you going too?

479
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:51,446
Might as well.

480
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:55,492
My ass.

481
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:58,954
You don't have to
do these things, Ye-seul.

482
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:01,415
Why do the extra work?

483
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:03,291
Chief Ji takes care of you.

484
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:05,836
I'm just trying to do my part.

485
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:08,463
I should do something
if I don't want to disgrace my mom.

486
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:12,175
Your heart is as beautiful as your looks.

487
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:15,679
Look, old man.

488
00:50:15,762 --> 00:50:17,597
I'm not an old man.

489
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:20,225
I'm not that much older than you.

490
00:50:20,308 --> 00:50:21,560
Do you know how old I am?

491
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:23,895
Well…

492
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:25,063
Do you like me?

493
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:28,650
I can't say I don't.

494
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:32,821
Everyone here likes you, Ye-seul.

495
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:34,448
Guess what?

496
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:37,617
I don't like you.

497
00:50:38,326 --> 00:50:39,369
You're not my type.

498
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:43,081
Even if the world came to an end,
you wouldn't be an option.

499
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:53,091
Jeez.

500
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:55,719
What was that?

501
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:07,290
Ye-seul.

502
00:52:12,045 --> 00:52:13,255
I need your help.

503
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:15,632
You're the only one I can trust.

504
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:18,343
Please?

505
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:35,527
You got a signal from the search team?

506
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:37,821
Yes, they seem to have
safely arrived at Bamseom.

507
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:39,614
Can we get them on the radio?

508
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:43,076
No, sir. They're quite far.

509
00:52:44,369 --> 00:52:47,122
If you get another signal,
report it immediately.

510
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:48,707
Yes, sir.

511
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:53,879
What's wrong with this thing?

512
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:55,839
What is it?

513
00:53:24,826 --> 00:53:26,369
Something's disrupting the signal.

514
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:29,497
I'm sure!

515
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:30,957
I'm certain I heard it.

516
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,250
I heard a monster

517
00:53:32,792 --> 00:53:34,544
behind the wall.

518
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:36,421
You can talk to Master Sergeant Tak.

519
00:53:36,504 --> 00:53:37,422
Okay.

520
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:39,466
Sir.

521
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:44,971
Sir.

522
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:46,973
It seems like…

523
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:50,810
there's a monster in the stadium.

524
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:11,915
Sir.

525
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:15,418
Look.

526
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:18,088
-We're detecting a monster.
-What the hell?

527
00:54:39,651 --> 00:54:40,860
What's going on?

528
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:42,362
Emergency roll call.

529
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:43,738
Please follow us to the central plaza.

530
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:51,663
I'll be there soon.

531
00:54:52,163 --> 00:54:54,499
You have to go right now.

532
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:57,168
Master Sergeant Tak wants you there.

533
00:54:58,253 --> 00:54:59,754
Did he find an exit?

534
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:00,672
No.

535
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:03,550
We think there's a monster
inside the stadium.

536
00:55:19,607 --> 00:55:22,277
All of those monster detectors

537
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,696
were beeping all at once.

538
00:55:24,779 --> 00:55:25,905
This one's for real.

539
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:29,909
-Did you see it for yourself?
-Is he serious?

540
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:32,954
If it weren't for me,
you would be all dead.

541
00:55:33,038 --> 00:55:34,914
-Is that so?
-Goodness!

542
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:36,458
-What a relief!
-Great job!

543
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:46,968
I can't stand that old man.

544
00:55:47,635 --> 00:55:48,678
Tell me about it.

545
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:53,558
Why are you by yourself?

546
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:08,448
Did you ditch your family?

547
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:10,075
Did you?

548
00:56:10,658 --> 00:56:12,410
I'm different.

549
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:14,245
We just had an argument.

550
00:56:16,247 --> 00:56:18,500
You cheeky little brat.

551
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:28,301
After a little growing up,
I realized it was all my fault.

552
00:56:29,594 --> 00:56:32,680
When grown-ups get mad at you,
it's for a good reason.

553
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:35,517
So go apologize to your mom.

554
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:38,186
My mom is already dead.

555
00:56:41,606 --> 00:56:42,774
What was that?

556
00:56:42,857 --> 00:56:44,484
Who says you can only have one mom?

557
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:47,570
You could have two or even three.

558
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:50,156
Ms. Cha is your mom, okay?

559
00:56:52,158 --> 00:56:53,326
Little brat.

560
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:40,039
What's going on?

561
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:42,292
-Is there really a monster?
-Kill it already!

562
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:45,086
The Platoon needs to do their job.

563
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:54,512
What the hell are you doing?

564
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:12,405
The Crow Platoon will take care
of the monsterization incident today.

565
00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:16,493
No one is safe.

566
00:58:17,368 --> 00:58:19,245
That's the nature of this catastrophe.

567
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:22,165
We had to witness our friends, family,

568
00:58:22,248 --> 00:58:24,250
and lovers' deaths

569
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:27,253
with our own eyes

570
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:29,380
and will continue to do so.

571
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:32,258
Do not trust anyone.

572
00:58:32,884 --> 00:58:35,094
That's the only way
we can protect this place.

573
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:02,163
Don't stand around asking for protection.

574
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:04,666
Fight fiercely for your own lives.

575
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:06,918
If you don't brace yourselves,

576
00:59:08,419 --> 00:59:10,088
you'll be consumed.

577
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:14,842
From now on,

578
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:19,138
those who hide their symptoms
and the ones who harbor them

579
00:59:20,181 --> 00:59:22,308
will face immediate consequences.

580
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:26,354
Please help us

581
00:59:27,105 --> 00:59:28,231
keep our hands clean.

582
00:59:29,023 --> 00:59:31,568
What on earth is he talking about?

583
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:33,778
I think he means
they'll kill anyone with symptoms.

584
00:59:33,861 --> 00:59:36,698
He just declared a reign of terror.

585
00:59:36,781 --> 00:59:38,491
But the detectors were ringing!

586
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:41,536
Is he saying they took care of it or not?

587
00:59:41,619 --> 00:59:42,662
We're safe, right?

588
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:44,163
I'm sure they dealt with it.

589
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:55,717
Great speech.

590
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:58,428
But didn't you forget something?

591
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:04,892
Stop hiding behind your men

592
01:00:05,476 --> 01:00:09,105
and set an example for everyone.

593
01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:26,122
Sir, you don't have to do this.

594
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:21,219
-What?
-What's going on?

595
01:01:21,302 --> 01:01:23,096
-What's with the light?
-What is this?

596
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:25,139
Why did the lights turn off?

597
01:01:25,223 --> 01:01:27,392
-What's going on?
-What the hell?

598
01:01:44,742 --> 01:01:46,160
I can't just wait around.

599
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:17,942
-Is this the right place?
-Probably.

600
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:22,989
Aren't you going to ask
what I'm looking for?

601
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:24,115
Don't you want to know?

602
01:02:24,699 --> 01:02:26,117
Is this about your research?

603
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:29,328
I don't need to know anything
that's not about the mission.

604
01:02:31,289 --> 01:02:34,125
Our priority is to secure your item
and get out as soon as possible.

605
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:35,626
If it's that important…

606
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:39,505
someone might've taken it already.

607
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:40,465
No one can find it.

608
01:02:40,548 --> 01:02:42,717
I have it hidden very well.

609
01:02:44,385 --> 01:02:45,470
You sound so certain.

610
01:02:46,053 --> 01:02:47,013
Of course.

611
01:02:47,513 --> 01:02:48,681
What I'm looking for…

612
01:02:50,349 --> 01:02:52,351
isn't an object.

613
01:03:27,428 --> 01:03:28,971
The stench alone could kill us.

614
01:03:41,025 --> 01:03:42,193
Something's here.

615
01:04:00,461 --> 01:04:01,295
U-seok.

616
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:03,464
U-seok.

617
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:10,137
U-seok.

618
01:04:13,307 --> 01:04:14,141
U-seok!

619
01:04:14,642 --> 01:04:15,560
God damn it.

620
01:04:49,302 --> 01:04:50,928
Motherfuckers.

621
01:04:55,683 --> 01:04:56,851
From this point on,

622
01:04:58,269 --> 01:04:59,770
kill everything in your sight.

623
01:05:23,794 --> 01:05:24,795
What happened…

624
01:05:26,047 --> 01:05:27,423
to this place?

625
01:05:37,266 --> 01:05:38,851
Doctor, you can't go off on your…

626
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:40,686
Yeong-hu.

627
01:05:42,438 --> 01:05:43,773
They got U-seok.

628
01:05:50,821 --> 01:05:52,823
Yeong-hu.

629
01:05:52,907 --> 01:05:54,075
Seo-jin, what's going on?

630
01:05:59,288 --> 01:06:00,539
Sergeant Min, report in.

631
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:02,625
Sergeant Min!

632
01:06:24,647 --> 01:06:25,481
U-seok.

633
01:06:27,441 --> 01:06:28,442
U-seok.

634
01:06:30,528 --> 01:06:32,113
What are you doing here?

635
01:06:32,863 --> 01:06:34,281
Hey, pull yourself together.

636
01:06:34,365 --> 01:06:36,033
U-seok, answer me.

637
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:37,660
Hey.

638
01:06:38,369 --> 01:06:39,745
Wake up.

639
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:41,247
Answer me.

640
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:42,665
Answer me.

641
01:06:42,748 --> 01:06:43,833
Answer me!

642
01:06:48,921 --> 01:06:50,423
U-seok.

643
01:06:50,506 --> 01:06:52,800
Sir, we have to go.

644
01:06:53,551 --> 01:06:54,468
Sir!

645
01:06:56,512 --> 01:06:57,596
He's dead, sir.

646
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,140
We have to go now!

647
01:06:59,223 --> 01:07:00,558
He's dead!

648
01:07:01,726 --> 01:07:02,727
We gotta go, sir!

649
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:10,943
Let's go, U-seok.

650
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:13,529
Get your shit together, Sarge!
We have to go!

651
01:07:13,612 --> 01:07:14,864
U-seok…

652
01:07:21,912 --> 01:07:23,831
-Come on.
-U-seok.

653
01:07:24,790 --> 01:07:27,251
-U-seok.
-Come on already!

654
01:07:27,334 --> 01:07:28,169
U-seok.

655
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:49,065
Sergeant Min.

656
01:07:49,607 --> 01:07:50,649
Answer me, Min!

657
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:54,820
Seok-chan, tell them…

658
01:08:12,171 --> 01:08:13,380
What the hell are these?

659
01:08:16,634 --> 01:08:17,927
They were monsters.

660
01:08:18,427 --> 01:08:20,471
But they've evolved.

661
01:08:20,554 --> 01:08:21,388
Are you saying…

662
01:08:23,724 --> 01:08:25,017
those are all monsters?

663
01:08:34,902 --> 01:08:36,028
Don't touch it.

664
01:08:38,614 --> 01:08:39,990
Did you forget about earlier?

665
01:08:40,825 --> 01:08:43,285
You want me to pretend I didn't see this?

666
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:44,245
Why would I do that?

667
01:08:44,328 --> 01:08:46,622
Don't do anything
that could sabotage the mission.

668
01:08:49,834 --> 01:08:50,793
Sergeant Kim.

669
01:08:50,876 --> 01:08:52,461
This is how the world works.

670
01:08:53,879 --> 01:08:58,300
In order to gain one thing,
you have to be ready to lose another.

671
01:08:58,384 --> 01:08:59,718
But you know that already, don't you?

672
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:01,679
Isn't that how you survived for so long?

673
01:09:01,762 --> 01:09:04,140
If you're saying I should
be ready to lose my men,

674
01:09:04,223 --> 01:09:06,392
I can't guarantee the safety
of your life either.

675
01:09:07,059 --> 01:09:09,270
So you just want me to stare at it?

676
01:09:09,353 --> 01:09:10,521
It's hanging right there.

677
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:14,817
To the research facility.

678
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:15,860
Something wrong, sir?

679
01:09:17,945 --> 01:09:19,488
I think the guys are in trouble.

680
01:09:20,406 --> 01:09:21,949
I can't reach them or ensure their safety.

681
01:09:22,032 --> 01:09:22,867
Let's rendezvous with them.

682
01:09:24,535 --> 01:09:26,787
-Let's go.
-After we came all the way here?

683
01:09:28,247 --> 01:09:29,290
I can't.

684
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:31,208
No way.

685
01:09:31,292 --> 01:09:33,627
I can't go back empty-handed.

686
01:09:35,546 --> 01:09:37,965
What do you expect us to do then?

687
01:09:38,048 --> 01:09:39,592
Will you stay here by yourself?

688
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:45,681
Fine.

689
01:09:46,932 --> 01:09:48,100
What I'm saying is…

690
01:09:49,226 --> 01:09:51,729
you should go ahead since I'd be a burden.

691
01:09:52,521 --> 01:09:55,816
I'll be outside
after I tend to my business here.

692
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:58,402
-It'll be dangerous.
-It's fine.

693
01:10:00,571 --> 01:10:03,240
Well, go already.
Your men could be in danger.

694
01:10:10,706 --> 01:10:11,832
Okay then.

695
01:10:13,584 --> 01:10:14,418
Let's roll.

696
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:23,135
Don't touch anything else.
Just find what you need and come back.

697
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:24,220
Understood?

698
01:10:24,803 --> 01:10:25,763
Okay.

699
01:10:25,846 --> 01:10:28,766
I get scared easily,
so I won't do anything rash. Just go.

700
01:10:30,559 --> 01:10:31,560
Let's move.

701
01:10:53,666 --> 01:10:54,625
I'm fine.

702
01:10:56,710 --> 01:10:58,212
No, you're going to trip.

703
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:00,965
Sit by the fire.

704
01:11:05,719 --> 01:11:07,137
So which is it?

705
01:11:08,806 --> 01:11:11,100
Brother? Boss? Dad?

706
01:11:12,726 --> 01:11:14,019
What's your real identity?

707
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:16,230
What's it to you?

708
01:11:16,313 --> 01:11:17,898
Just eat this and get lost.

709
01:11:20,567 --> 01:11:22,861
Why don't you come to the stadium with us?

710
01:11:23,445 --> 01:11:24,530
You'll be safer there.

711
01:11:25,364 --> 01:11:26,865
Am I getting married to you then?

712
01:11:28,409 --> 01:11:29,702
No, ma'am.

713
01:11:29,785 --> 01:11:32,788
"Safer"? You've just been lucky.

714
01:11:33,414 --> 01:11:35,332
Or you're just ignorant.

715
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,294
We're doing a better job
than you might think.

716
01:11:38,377 --> 01:11:40,296
I don't trust people.

717
01:11:41,255 --> 01:11:42,381
Or monsters.

718
01:11:45,801 --> 01:11:47,386
What about her? Do you trust her?

719
01:11:56,020 --> 01:11:57,146
I guess you do.

720
01:11:59,106 --> 01:12:02,568
Come on, let's go with them.

721
01:12:03,652 --> 01:12:04,820
Please?

722
01:12:08,574 --> 01:12:09,783
How dare you come here?

723
01:12:46,570 --> 01:12:47,613
Help me.

724
01:12:49,865 --> 01:12:51,742
This was the only place I could think of.

725
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:10,886
What happened to her?

726
01:13:11,678 --> 01:13:14,098
What about the kid?
The little girl who was with you.

727
01:13:14,973 --> 01:13:16,433
Let's get her inside.

728
01:13:17,059 --> 01:13:18,102
Give me a hand.

729
01:13:18,644 --> 01:13:19,478
Okay.

730
01:13:31,156 --> 01:13:32,074
Sir!

731
01:13:32,157 --> 01:13:33,867
You got some nerve, coming down here.

732
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:35,077
Stop it.

733
01:13:35,869 --> 01:13:36,995
That's enough!

734
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:38,372
I warned you

735
01:13:38,455 --> 01:13:40,290
not to bring in any monsters.

736
01:13:40,374 --> 01:13:41,583
She's been looking for them.

737
01:13:42,084 --> 01:13:44,586
-You should talk to--
-Does he look human to you?

738
01:13:51,802 --> 01:13:53,387
Don't move an inch.

739
01:13:53,470 --> 01:13:54,763
If you take another step,

740
01:13:55,806 --> 01:13:57,516
It'll be her life.

741
01:13:59,852 --> 01:14:02,396
This is why I don't trust people.

742
01:14:03,063 --> 01:14:05,899
Look at how you repay me for saving you.

743
01:14:05,983 --> 01:14:07,484
I said I'll take them away.

744
01:14:08,068 --> 01:14:10,821
So what's the problem?

745
01:14:10,904 --> 01:14:13,073
You're dangerous enough
for hanging out with monsters.

746
01:14:13,657 --> 01:14:15,701
People should stick with people.

747
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:18,662
Are you confident?

748
01:14:19,204 --> 01:14:21,123
That you won't become a monster?

749
01:14:22,166 --> 01:14:24,084
You could start having symptoms right now.

750
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:27,296
Then you'd have to kill yourself.

751
01:14:27,963 --> 01:14:29,465
Since monsters deserve to die.

752
01:14:30,048 --> 01:14:30,966
That's enough.

753
01:14:33,886 --> 01:14:34,720
What about her?

754
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:37,848
You should kill her if she turns.

755
01:14:39,850 --> 01:14:42,144
Or would you rather
I kill her before then?

756
01:14:45,022 --> 01:14:47,065
Let's just call it bad blood.

757
01:14:47,566 --> 01:14:48,692
Stop it.

758
01:14:49,693 --> 01:14:50,944
Don't do this, Eun-yu.

759
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:02,372
Ha-ni!

760
01:15:17,930 --> 01:15:18,889
Let's go, old man.

761
01:15:29,733 --> 01:15:30,901
Come on, let's go.

762
01:15:37,658 --> 01:15:39,701
I guess we're not
meant to be in this life.

763
01:15:40,994 --> 01:15:42,204
See you in the next one.

764
01:15:43,163 --> 01:15:44,706
Don't bring her with you though.

765
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:09,398
Can you move?

766
01:16:11,024 --> 01:16:12,109
What about the wound?

767
01:16:16,113 --> 01:16:16,989
I'm fine.

768
01:16:22,828 --> 01:16:24,079
We should get to safety.

769
01:16:24,663 --> 01:16:26,498
The gunfire may have attracted monsters.

770
01:16:42,723 --> 01:16:43,682
Let's go.

771
01:17:00,490 --> 01:17:01,617
Hypocrite.

772
01:17:02,993 --> 01:17:04,369
Coward.

773
01:17:05,078 --> 01:17:07,122
Are you going to say
you had no choice again?

774
01:17:08,457 --> 01:17:10,208
You were just running away.

775
01:17:12,336 --> 01:17:15,464
You keep making the wrong decisions.

776
01:18:09,267 --> 01:18:11,269
-Dad!
-You said you'd protect them.

777
01:18:13,814 --> 01:18:14,815
Dad!

778
01:18:14,898 --> 01:18:15,732
DAD
HELP ME

779
01:18:15,816 --> 01:18:16,942
Help me!

780
01:18:17,526 --> 01:18:19,403
But look at what you're doing.

781
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:23,281
I'm scared.

782
01:18:23,365 --> 01:18:24,574
Tell everyone.

783
01:18:24,658 --> 01:18:25,784
Dad!

784
01:18:25,867 --> 01:18:29,871
Tell them that you're the monster
inside this stadium.

785
01:18:38,964 --> 01:18:39,881
Sir.

786
01:18:40,382 --> 01:18:41,550
May I come in?

787
01:18:55,522 --> 01:18:56,356
Sir.

788
01:18:56,857 --> 01:18:58,150
We have a problem.

789
01:19:04,489 --> 01:19:05,407
Sir?

790
01:19:12,956 --> 01:19:13,874
Sir?

791
