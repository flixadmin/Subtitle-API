1
00:00:24,658 --> 00:00:27,559
<i>Escobar had made a career
out of terror.</i>

2
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:30,631
<i>And for the most part,
it had worked.</i>

3
00:00:31,732 --> 00:00:34,167
<i>But when he parked 220 pounds
of TNT</i>

4
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:37,033
<i>outside of a downtown Bogotá
shopping center</i>

5
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:39,697
<i>a week before school started
up again,</i>

6
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:42,173
<i>no one could deny he had gone
too far.</i>

7
00:00:43,744 --> 00:00:45,838
<i>The whole nation was enraged.</i>

8
00:00:47,681 --> 00:00:49,877
<i>There was no explaining this one away.</i>

9
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,513
<i>And no hiding from it.</i>

10
00:00:54,588 --> 00:00:57,922
DEATH TO ESCOBAR

11
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:01,590
Forgive me.

12
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:07,058
Children and innocent people
died in that bombing.

13
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:10,831
That was an act of pure terrorism.
It must be answered for.

14
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,498
Surrender, unconditionally, now.

15
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:18,375
What kind of country is it
when a death squad is not only tolerated

16
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:21,073
but is actually sanctioned
by the goddamn government?

17
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:24,048
Do you want to see Bogotá
turned into a crater?

18
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:29,612
Is that what it will take to protect
my family from those bastards, Los Pepes?

19
00:01:29,723 --> 00:01:34,024
No. Your family's safety
is our utmost concern.

20
00:01:35,062 --> 00:01:39,795
They're simply in protective custody.

21
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,427
Get my family out of Colombia.

22
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:46,563
We can get your family out of Colombia.

23
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:53,410
But I can't guarantee any country
will accept them.

24
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,780
I don't have that kind of power.

25
00:01:56,883 --> 00:01:59,944
You better find that kind of power,

26
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:04,752
because I won't even discuss surrender
until my family is out of the country.

27
00:02:04,825 --> 00:02:07,920
Until then, we have nothing to talk about.

28
00:02:07,995 --> 00:02:09,121
<i>That's right.</i>

29
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:14,133
<i>A guy who knew no bounds, no limits,
had finally gone too far.</i>

30
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:18,102
<i>He probably didn't know it then,
or maybe he just couldn't accept it,</i>

31
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:22,768
<i>but the end was coming for him,
and it was about time.</i>

32
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:55,766
Congressional leaders
are calling for immediate action

33
00:03:55,869 --> 00:04:00,238
and President Gaviria has called an
emergency meeting of the national police.

34
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,035
Yesterday's bombing
has resulted in a total of...

35
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:03,941
Now he's really fucked up.

36
00:04:06,213 --> 00:04:09,672
Pacho, I want you on a plane to Miami.

37
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,248
It's time.

38
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:16,450
And Escobar's family?
Should we get them?

39
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:20,793
No, not now.
They're surrounded by police.

40
00:04:21,695 --> 00:04:23,925
They're not going anywhere.

41
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:29,798
Son of a bitch.

42
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,480
Stay there. You can go.

43
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,217
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

44
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:03,225
Agent Jimenez, put out that cigarette
and go downstairs, please.

45
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:08,069
- And don't smoke in the room again.
- Yes, sir.

46
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:11,441
Thank you.

47
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,575
Excuse me.

48
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:18,941
- Who wants dinner?
- Me!

49
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:24,522
Stop looking out the window.
There's no one out there.

50
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:26,183
Come eat something.

51
00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:28,455
- Mama?
- Yes, my love?

52
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:30,519
Who are Los Pepes?

53
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:37,970
No one. No one you have to worry about.
All right, my love?

54
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:40,006
And how much longer do we have
to be here?

55
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:41,665
Not much longer, love.
Keep eating.

56
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,170
Can I speak with you a moment?

57
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:51,473
- We have to do something, Hermilda.
- Pablo will fix this, like always.

58
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:53,679
We can't even call him.

59
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:58,657
Even if we could,
all the telephones are tapped anyway.

60
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:04,692
We're alone, Hermilda.

61
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:08,702
And you're telling me
everything will be okay?

62
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,380
Our situation with Escobar
is coming to a head.

63
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:31,924
Due to our efforts,
his organization is shrinking.

64
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:37,054
Intel suggests that his inner circle
has been reduced to a few loyal sicarios.

65
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:38,756
Bit of a mixed blessing.

66
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:41,698
Fewer sicarios,
less radio chatter for me to trace.

67
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:44,169
We had a tap put on that
lawyer's phone,

68
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,228
but I guess he isn't
taking any more calls.

69
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,507
It's Los Pepes.

70
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:54,947
They kill Fernando Duque,
but they also killed his son, his wife.

71
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:58,211
But they also stabbed, viciously,
his innocent mother.

72
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:03,522
But I accepted a sad truth.

73
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:08,285
No one is willing to police Los Pepes,
so we're gonna concentrate on Escobar.

74
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:13,022
I would also like to say that...

75
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:18,767
I know that someone
has been in contact with Los Pepes.

76
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:21,204
And while it sickens me...

77
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:26,543
there's nothing I can or will
do about it.

78
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:30,743
But the man standing over Escobar
when this is over

79
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:33,650
needs to be a Colombian police officer.

80
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,115
And not some vigilante.

81
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:41,384
- Thank you.
- Excuse me, Colonel...

82
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:47,896
Guten tag.

83
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,935
Join the DEA, see the world, right?

84
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:55,837
The airport, anyways.

85
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,515
Listen...

86
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:12,455
I need you to prepare yourself
for some blowback.

87
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:15,586
It goes high up.

88
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:20,862
And these people aren't gonna like it
when I try to get myself out of it.

89
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:27,433
If they come after you
about what I've been doing,

90
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,373
you protect yourself first.

91
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:32,968
You didn't know anything.

92
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:35,879
Understand?

93
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:39,352
What are you gonna do?

94
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,482
I don't fucking know.

95
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:46,025
We've all gone off the rails
down here, Javi.

96
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:48,116
You heard what Martinez said.

97
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:51,653
If we're standing over Pablo
at the end of this, we win.

98
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:55,332
We can get out of this clean.

99
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,903
So I want you to think about that

100
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:03,408
before you make any more decisions
that you might regret.

101
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:19,324
Blackie. What's going on?

102
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:22,692
- Do you think you can get inside?
- No, boss. I don't think so.

103
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:25,390
With all the police swarming around,
it's impossible.

104
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:28,593
Can you see the top floor?
Through the windows?

105
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:32,168
No, I can't. It's too difficult.

106
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:35,435
Keep your eyes on it, Blackie.
You might see something.

107
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:37,571
Sure, boss.

108
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:40,374
All right, as soon as you see
anything, call me.

109
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:46,743
Blackie, it's important
that I know they're okay.

110
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,688
Hey, boss.

111
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,225
Can you believe it?

112
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,587
Just this second,
Tata came into view, boss.

113
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:57,595
What do you see? Is she alone?

114
00:09:57,697 --> 00:10:00,223
She looks beautiful.
She's at the window.

115
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:04,396
She's got that dress on that you had me
bring from Miami, remember, boss?

116
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:05,802
The one you like so much.

117
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,099
The children, Blackie.
Can you see them?

118
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:13,574
There, I can see Manuela, boss.

119
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:18,984
- Can she see you?
- She looks so pretty, boss.

120
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:21,716
Go.

121
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:24,220
Blackie...

122
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,419
thanks for this.

123
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:44,506
<i>Remember when people used to call
Pablo Escobar the paisa Robin Hood?</i>

124
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,670
<i>Well, that shit was over.</i>

125
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:50,940
<i>The bombing had shocked
even his staunchest supporters.</i>

126
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:54,282
<i>Many of the folks of Medellín
who had always protected him</i>

127
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:56,254
<i>were seeing him in a different light.</i>

128
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,915
<i>And no one knew that better
than Los Pepes.</i>

129
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,657
<i>They took out ads in local papers,</i>

130
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,821
<i>getting the word out
to Escobar's former allies...</i>

131
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,864
<i>Pablo was through.
Join Los Pepes or die.</i>

132
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:08,696
WANTED, PABLO ESCOBAR, IN DEFENSE
OF THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE, LOS PEPES

133
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:10,792
<i>And the traffickers
who didn't read the newspapers,</i>

134
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:14,534
<i>like the Gallón gang, for example,
who I doubt could even read,</i>

135
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:18,271
<i>got an in-person visit from Los Pepes'
most glamorous ambassador.</i>

136
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,335
- Héctor.
- Sir.

137
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:23,347
Do me a favor and bring
Miss Judy a beer.

138
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:25,144
- Of course, boss.
- Thanks.

139
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:27,778
This isn't about Pablo.
Pablo is a dead man.

140
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:31,484
It's just a matter of time.
We're here to talk about the future.

141
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:36,621
And if you're interested in the future,
then you'll have to join us.

142
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:41,190
Listen, Judy,
you know we never had problems with Pablo.

143
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:45,169
Plus, we had a very good relationship
with Kiko. Right, Berna?

144
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:48,208
- Yes.
- And that's why we made the decision

145
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:50,072
to stay out of this shit.

146
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,809
And that has been a good decision
for business as well?

147
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:57,011
Because things are very difficult.

148
00:11:57,083 --> 00:12:01,213
And when all this shit is over,
the organization will change,

149
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:04,052
the routes will change,
this whole city will change.

150
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:12,096
And how do you know
you'll still be in business, Judy?

151
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:14,394
That's why I'm talking to you.

152
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,832
If all of us from Medellín are united,

153
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:19,929
we'll be able to say what happens
to each one of us.

154
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:28,404
Meet me at Montecasino
with our associates,

155
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:30,846
and you tell them you're on our side.

156
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:38,113
She wants them to join Los Pepes.

157
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,091
They say Pablo Escobar is fucked,
that his time has come.

158
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,527
And that they have to decide
whose side they're on.

159
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,862
- What did they say?
- They're joining.

160
00:12:57,644 --> 00:12:59,408
Here's the information.

161
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,605
They have a meeting
with the Castaños on Friday.

162
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:05,542
This is big, boss.

163
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:10,784
If the Gallóns are with them,
maybe some of the other guys are too, huh?

164
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,091
When is it?

165
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:17,960
Friday at 9:00 p.m., boss.

166
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:20,655
Take that address...

167
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:24,498
and go to Montecasino.

168
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:26,766
Take Limón with you.

169
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,002
And find out what's going on over there.

170
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:32,278
Quica.

171
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:35,139
Are you all right?

172
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:36,943
Yes, boss.

173
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:45,283
How many men can we rely on?

174
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:51,454
I think I can round up a hundred.
But we need cash.

175
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,964
How much money do we have on hand?

176
00:13:56,035 --> 00:14:02,771
If we collect all the money in
the stash houses, that should be enough.

177
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:06,608
It's around this much.

178
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:11,481
I'm still waiting on a cash shipment
from Miami.

179
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:14,452
But it's harder than ever
to get it through.

180
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:21,986
Make sure we have the weapons and the men
we need when the time comes. Got it?

181
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:26,690
The only thing that matters now is getting
Tata and the children out of the country.

182
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:32,567
Then we can take care of business.

183
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:34,669
Go on.

184
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:36,140
Yes, sir.

185
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:53,189
You want to get that?

186
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:58,554
- Murphy.
- Get to Bogotá right away.

187
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:00,393
- Yeah? What for?
- A tier-one sicario

188
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,490
in police headquarters.

189
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:04,264
- Oh, who?
- Nelson Hernández.

190
00:15:05,338 --> 00:15:06,863
You know a Nelson Hernandez?

191
00:15:07,774 --> 00:15:10,709
- No.
- Yeah, tier-one my ass.

192
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:12,108
A.K.A Blackie.

193
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:13,679
No shit. Blackie.

194
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,408
CNP just picked him up
outside of the Tequendama.

195
00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:18,450
Get in a room with him
and see what he can give us.

196
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:19,712
We're already gone.

197
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:23,416
Bogotá police just busted Blackie.
Maybe he'll cut us a deal.

198
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,291
<i>Nabbing Blackie was a huge deal
for us.</i>

199
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:29,191
<i>Bad news for Pablo.</i>

200
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:32,030
<i>And there was more bad news
coming his way.</i>

201
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:39,431
<i>The thing about drug dealers is
you can't trust them for shit.</i>

202
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:43,765
<i>The Lion had been running Pablo's
Miami operation for years,</i>

203
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:44,866
<i>and gotten rich too.</i>

204
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:48,547
<i>But the moment Cali
offered him a better deal,</i>

205
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:51,413
<i>he welcomed his new partners
with open arms.</i>

206
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:54,276
<i>I mean, who could blame the Lion?</i>

207
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:57,652
<i>Pablo was on his way out
and Cali was the future.</i>

208
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,225
<i>He had introduced them
to Pablo's bankers...</i>

209
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:01,124
Oh, thank you.

210
00:16:01,227 --> 00:16:03,218
<i>His smugglers, all of it.</i>

211
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,230
<i>Though Pablo didn't know it yet,</i>

212
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,562
<i>his biggest rivals
had pulled off a silent coup.</i>

213
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,067
Pass that to me.

214
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:14,439
<i>They had stolen the crown jewel
in his empire right out from under him.</i>

215
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:17,807
- Guys.
<i>- And they didn't even have to fire a shot.</i>

216
00:16:19,612 --> 00:16:21,671
Nothing relevant happened today.

217
00:16:21,781 --> 00:16:25,809
Corrupt politicians, celebrity divorces.
Bullshit.

218
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:29,183
You don't like it, go work at CNN.

219
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:31,188
- Miss Velez.
- Yes, honey?

220
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,122
I'm sorry for interrupting,
but you have a call...

221
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:35,490
Take a message, I'm about to go on air.

222
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:39,031
Yes, but it's Pablo Escobar's wife.
She says it's urgent.

223
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,769
What are you doing?
Answer the call.

224
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:57,875
You have to get her
to give you an interview.

225
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:06,624
Hello?

226
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:10,958
Hello?

227
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:16,628
I know that you and I have had
a lot of problems in the past.

228
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:21,203
But I need you to help me.

229
00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:25,803
<i>While everyone could agree
that Escobar had to go down,</i>

230
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,813
<i>there was a lot of disagreement
on how to make that happen.</i>

231
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:33,250
<i>Escobar was still dangerous and many
in government wanted him to surrender.</i>

232
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:36,083
<i>To them, holding his family
was not only immoral,</i>

233
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:38,179
<i>but it could lead to more violence.</i>

234
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:41,716
<i>An upcoming presidential election
made it a big issue.</i>

235
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:44,990
<i>Gaviria was under a lot of pressure
to let the family go.</i>

236
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:48,523
<i>And it was getting harder and harder
for him to resist.</i>

237
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:53,663
I brought all the influence
the party can bear on Gaviria.

238
00:17:54,507 --> 00:18:01,504
And it seems he has agreed
to find asylum for your family.

239
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,179
Where?

240
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,514
No, that remains to be seen.

241
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:10,720
But we will meet in his office,

242
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:16,092
I suppose to discuss the terms
of their relocation.

243
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,564
Thank you, sir.

244
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:21,430
- You're a man of your word.
- I am.

245
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:24,060
Now you must be of your word.

246
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:27,767
I will. Be sure of that.

247
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:32,572
The moment my family is safe,
we will speak again.

248
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:34,943
- Until then.
- Thank you.

249
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:38,879
She's here.

250
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,419
Bring her here.

251
00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:06,579
Hello, Valeria.

252
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,775
I liked it more with the hood on.

253
00:19:12,852 --> 00:19:18,916
I told them, don't take me anywhere
that doesn't have a beautiful pool.

254
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:25,290
It's very dangerous
to be my friend these days.

255
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:30,193
Come on.

256
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:49,817
Look. These are the codes for the radio.
I'll put them here.

257
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,383
And here is some cash.

258
00:19:56,629 --> 00:19:58,495
This is for you.

259
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:01,556
- No, Pablo. I don't want your money.
- It's for your help.

260
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:08,198
I'm doing this for you.

261
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,712
Thank you.

262
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:32,590
I'm worried about you, Pablo.

263
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:55,745
You guys can't do shit to me.

264
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:59,915
De Greiff offered us amnesty.

265
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,458
That's right.

266
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:05,886
But you have to talk to get it.

267
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:09,734
You want to negotiate, gringo?

268
00:21:09,802 --> 00:21:12,203
You want to negotiate?
Let's negotiate.

269
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,373
I'll give you something.
Something small.

270
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,800
Blackie...

271
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,972
Blackie, Blackie, Blackie.

272
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,814
What name did your mother give you?

273
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:35,591
Nelson Hernández Lucumí.

274
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:36,924
Lucumí?

275
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:41,658
From the Pacific.

276
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:48,335
Lucumí, they found explosive residue
on your hands.

277
00:21:50,276 --> 00:21:52,472
On your jacket, everywhere.

278
00:22:08,761 --> 00:22:11,696
They're going to blame you
for that bomb, Lucumí.

279
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,597
Hey...

280
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:22,830
- I had nothing to do with it.
- We know that.

281
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:27,706
We know it wasn't your idea.
We know you're not the boss.

282
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:35,515
Don't let them blame you for this.

283
00:22:35,621 --> 00:22:40,616
Don't let them see you as the one
who killed all those innocent children.

284
00:22:45,164 --> 00:22:48,293
Help us and we'll help you.

285
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,362
Give us Pablo.

286
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:58,569
No fucking way.
I can't give you Pablo.

287
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:01,573
No fucking way I give you the boss.

288
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:04,242
Then give us something.

289
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,713
You have to give us something
or they'll hang you.

290
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:18,826
I'll give you...

291
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,531
La Quica.

292
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,571
Faggots.

293
00:23:51,063 --> 00:23:52,690
There's a lot of them.

294
00:23:55,401 --> 00:23:57,597
Do you think we can take all of them?

295
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:00,402
What's wrong, brother?

296
00:24:01,073 --> 00:24:03,940
You're turning into a pussy.

297
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:08,808
If you're scared, why don't you run away?

298
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:11,542
Abandon the boss.
It's that easy, brother.

299
00:24:12,718 --> 00:24:14,083
No, brother.

300
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:18,320
I'm loyal to the boss.

301
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:22,590
And if I have to die, I'll die, brother.

302
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:24,959
You better, motherfucker.

303
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:31,468
This is the biggest lead we've ever had.

304
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:34,164
- La Quica can give us Pablo.
- We can help triangulate from the air,

305
00:24:34,273 --> 00:24:36,298
but really only units on the ground
can find him.

306
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:40,902
So that means that we have to drive around
Medellín hoping to get lucky

307
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,175
and La Quica is using his phone?

308
00:24:42,281 --> 00:24:45,080
He will be because we'll be calling him
with Blackie's phone.

309
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:47,144
He picks up, we get a signal.

310
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,585
Tracking phones like this
is all about proximity.

311
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:53,489
- If you have the number.
- The number we got.

312
00:24:54,093 --> 00:24:57,427
Okay. And who else has his number?

313
00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:02,659
I mean, who else is gonna show up
when we track it down?

314
00:25:06,138 --> 00:25:07,503
Just us.

315
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:11,867
Okay.

316
00:25:13,112 --> 00:25:14,944
- Trujillo.
- Yes, Colonel.

317
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:16,812
Prepare the emergency team.

318
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:19,317
They need to be ready
when we get the signal.

319
00:25:19,385 --> 00:25:22,548
- Yes, Colonel.
- Martinez, get your people ready.

320
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:25,782
We'll start tracking them
first thing tomorrow.

321
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:27,451
At your service, Colonel.

322
00:25:43,342 --> 00:25:45,003
Good work on Blackie.

323
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,148
I need to know you didn't make the call.

324
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:56,814
The only thing I want
is to get that son of a bitch Escobar.

325
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:58,687
It's the only thing I want, Peña.

326
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:02,159
- For all the lives he has taken.
- I know.

327
00:26:04,363 --> 00:26:05,922
But not with them.

328
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:10,698
I believe firmly in what the colonel said.

329
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:15,400
When Escobar dies, a Colombian cop
should be standing over him.

330
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:26,281
- Good evening, Ms. Velez.
- Good evening.

331
00:26:26,385 --> 00:26:28,911
Welcome, they're expecting you.

332
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:35,526
What is she doing here?

333
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:41,399
I sent for her.

334
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:44,397
Please, take the children to their room.

335
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:47,530
Please.

336
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,472
Let's go. Let's go.

337
00:27:03,889 --> 00:27:05,414
This is from Pablo.

338
00:27:09,261 --> 00:27:11,628
It's a radio telephone,
so you can speak with him.

339
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:16,233
This is a cipher sheet
for the frequencies he'll be on all day.

340
00:27:19,071 --> 00:27:21,062
You must keep it hidden.

341
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:27,004
He also sent you money.

342
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:35,119
Thank you.

343
00:27:44,296 --> 00:27:48,756
Well, let's do the interview already.

344
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:54,937
You know what? Another time.

345
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:57,772
When all of this is over.

346
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:13,953
I'm supposed to be interviewing you.
I can't leave so quickly.

347
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:20,028
Then stay.

348
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,067
You can show yourself out
when you're ready.

349
00:28:33,345 --> 00:28:34,904
Pablo?

350
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:41,418
Tata.

351
00:28:43,155 --> 00:28:44,714
Pablo, is it you?

352
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:48,853
So good to hear your voice, my love.

353
00:28:50,996 --> 00:28:53,158
How are you, Tata?

354
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,197
How are our children?

355
00:28:56,868 --> 00:28:58,563
My love, we're all okay.

356
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:00,570
We need you.

357
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:02,197
And I need you.

358
00:29:02,274 --> 00:29:05,608
Listen, I'm going
to get you out of there soon.

359
00:29:05,711 --> 00:29:08,339
I talked to the attorney general.
Everything is ready.

360
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:12,850
Just hearing your voice, I feel calm.

361
00:29:14,386 --> 00:29:16,218
I love you very much.

362
00:29:16,288 --> 00:29:19,588
I love you, my darling.
I love you...

363
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:43,081
Mr. President, I ask you
not to take this as a failure.

364
00:29:45,217 --> 00:29:48,380
Escobar will be brought to justice.

365
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:51,650
And once his family is out of Colombia,

366
00:29:51,757 --> 00:29:56,058
he will reinitiate negotiations
for his surrender.

367
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:59,154
- I already did that.
- Yes.

368
00:29:59,765 --> 00:30:03,133
Well, I've got a list here

369
00:30:03,235 --> 00:30:08,435
of possible locations that would be safe
for the Escobar family.

370
00:30:08,507 --> 00:30:14,344
If you ask officially,
those countries will allow them to enter.

371
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:20,418
Attorney General De Greiff...

372
00:30:21,687 --> 00:30:23,348
it seems you've been misinformed.

373
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:29,654
Escobar's family isn't going anywhere.

374
00:30:32,364 --> 00:30:33,195
Pardon me?

375
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:35,824
I won't lift a finger to find them asylum.

376
00:30:36,535 --> 00:30:41,097
I am categorically opposed
to you or anyone else doing so.

377
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:43,437
Do you know what that means?

378
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:46,334
There will be no surrender.

379
00:30:46,445 --> 00:30:50,177
The violence will not end.

380
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:53,610
And you will be the one responsible.

381
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:57,178
You will be the one responsible.

382
00:30:58,457 --> 00:31:02,792
Your promises and negotiations
have only brought us more violence,

383
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,454
while making him stronger.

384
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:10,191
This, Mr. De Greiff, doesn't end
with Pablo Escobar's surrender.

385
00:31:11,403 --> 00:31:12,495
This...

386
00:31:15,073 --> 00:31:17,064
This ends with his death.

387
00:31:20,746 --> 00:31:23,215
No, you don't need to worry
about anything.

388
00:31:23,315 --> 00:31:27,218
Put yourself at ease. We got it.

389
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:32,220
Miami is ours.
I'll be back in Colombia tonight.

390
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,728
- Hi, there.
- How's it going?

391
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:47,701
What's up, little Lion?

392
00:31:47,773 --> 00:31:50,037
Doing good. Just hanging out.

393
00:31:50,108 --> 00:31:51,906
Is everything packed or what?

394
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:56,710
I don't get why you're staying
in this dump, brother.

395
00:31:56,782 --> 00:31:59,513
I would have thought that
Pacho Herrera

396
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:03,543
would be staying in a five star hotel
with all the bells and whistles...

397
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:31,309
- Do you want juice, my love?
- Yes.

398
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:32,884
I'll take more.

399
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,147
PABLO'S WHORE

400
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:15,825
So my business is done?
Is that right?

401
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:18,089
I can't get anyone
on the phone, sir.

402
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:23,496
I called many times.
Many times.

403
00:33:24,636 --> 00:33:28,197
I called everyone in Miami.
There's no trace of the Lion.

404
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:38,308
Pablo!

405
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:48,957
Tata?

406
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:52,793
Pablo, they killed her.
They dumped her in front of the hotel.

407
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,332
Who?

408
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:59,133
Valeria.

409
00:34:07,579 --> 00:34:09,069
Are you all okay?

410
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:12,976
Yes, we're okay.

411
00:34:13,752 --> 00:34:14,685
Listen.

412
00:34:15,487 --> 00:34:18,582
I need you to be strong.

413
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:23,491
Everything will end soon. But you need
to be stronger than ever, Tata.

414
00:34:24,262 --> 00:34:26,822
I'll call you back soon.

415
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,559
I love you very much.

416
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:39,543
Tonight...

417
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:43,737
we're going to fight
like we've never fought before.

418
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:48,014
We'll fight with everything we have.

419
00:34:50,355 --> 00:34:52,585
Fuck the Cali cartel!

420
00:34:52,691 --> 00:34:54,352
Fuck Judy Moncada!

421
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:56,895
Fuck Los Castaños!

422
00:34:56,962 --> 00:35:00,523
We're going to show these motherfuckers
who they are messing with,

423
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:03,625
because we're still the Medellín cartel

424
00:35:03,735 --> 00:35:08,195
and tonight we're going to Montecasino!

425
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:14,975
Bring all the men we can buy.

426
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:19,779
Go to Medellín,
to every money stash we have

427
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:22,285
and bring me every penny
you can find.

428
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:25,648
Limón and Quica
will take me to Montecasino,

429
00:35:25,757 --> 00:35:31,594
because tonight we'll be fighting
side by side to the death.

430
00:35:31,663 --> 00:35:34,894
And when those motherfuckers
open their doors to the Gallóns,

431
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:38,129
we'll go in and hit them
with everything we have!

432
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:40,602
- Got it?
- Yes, boss.

433
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:42,329
Boss...

434
00:35:44,843 --> 00:35:46,333
I think I should go with Rojas.

435
00:35:47,779 --> 00:35:49,110
It's too dangerous.

436
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:56,310
Okay.

437
00:35:57,856 --> 00:35:59,847
Take Ricardo with you.

438
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:02,484
As you wish, boss.

439
00:36:03,428 --> 00:36:04,452
Let's go, brother.

440
00:36:07,766 --> 00:36:09,530
- Lets go, go, go!
- Quickly!

441
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:14,499
Let's go!

442
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:24,338
Let's go! Let's go!

443
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:43,191
There. After that corner.
Right there.

444
00:36:47,739 --> 00:36:51,141
What are the odds
that we survive tonight?

445
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:56,674
Fifty-fifty.
But that's pretty good for us.

446
00:36:57,649 --> 00:36:59,242
Let's do this quickly.

447
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:08,253
<i>With Hugo Jr.'s RDF
surveillance team using Blackie's phone,</i>

448
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:12,262
<i>we had a real chance of tracking La Quica.
We just needed a little luck.</i>

449
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:16,095
- I think we're ready.
- We've cast as wide a net as possible.

450
00:37:17,202 --> 00:37:19,398
Guys, are we good?

451
00:37:19,504 --> 00:37:20,767
Go ahead.

452
00:37:20,872 --> 00:37:22,670
Go ahead, Murphy.

453
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:25,039
Copy that.
Centra Spike, you standing by?

454
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:30,444
We are in the air.
Condition one, Murphy. Make your call.

455
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:34,075
<i>All we had to do was call him,
hope he was in the area,</i>

456
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:35,675
<i>pray he picked up,</i>

457
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:39,622
<i>and then keep him on the line long enough
for our triangulation to pick up the ping.</i>

458
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:44,093
<i>And then snatch him up
without getting killed. Easy, right?</i>

459
00:37:46,865 --> 00:37:49,459
Hello? Hello?

460
00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:53,765
I can't hear you. Hello, hello?

461
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:57,373
Damn it.

462
00:37:59,077 --> 00:38:00,238
It was him.

463
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,448
Let's go.

464
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:07,218
Let's go to 10th and 32nd street.

465
00:38:10,989 --> 00:38:13,287
I need him on longer, guys.

466
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:17,085
Get him back on the phone.
Keep him on.

467
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:24,829
Answer it.

468
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:29,900
Fucking answer it. Could be the boss.

469
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,136
Hello?

470
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,169
Quica.

471
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:36,781
Hello.

472
00:38:36,848 --> 00:38:39,510
Shit. Who the fuck is this?

473
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:43,349
- Hello, Quica. How's it going, my friend?
- Motherfucker. Who is this?

474
00:38:43,454 --> 00:38:48,415
Calm down, Quica.
Don't be nervous. What's up, Quica?

475
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:50,518
Who the fuck do you think
you are, bitch?

476
00:38:51,963 --> 00:38:54,694
Hey, guys, we got a hit.
He's in Laureles.

477
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:57,461
- Velén, let's go!
- Let's go, they're in Laureles!

478
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:16,116
Hey, Rojas, wait for me.
You're leaving me behind.

479
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:27,160
- Murphy, Peña, one more time.
- Copy, copy. We're calling again.

480
00:39:36,007 --> 00:39:36,974
Hello?

481
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:40,675
Quica. What's up, Quica?

482
00:39:40,745 --> 00:39:44,204
Quica, Quica, Quica.
What time is it, Quica?

483
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:46,682
- What are you up to, Quica?
- Bastard.

484
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:55,187
You're the accountant.
How much is there?

485
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,228
I don't know. Maybe $500,000.

486
00:39:59,264 --> 00:40:03,997
Looks like you're almost out of money.
Leave some for the market, fat ass.

487
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:06,268
So funny.

488
00:40:06,371 --> 00:40:07,998
Why aren't you watching the car...

489
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:23,084
Sorry, but this toss of the coin
doesn't seem like a good idea to me.

490
00:40:23,187 --> 00:40:24,916
Let's make a deal...

491
00:40:40,238 --> 00:40:41,728
Motherfucker.

492
00:40:42,874 --> 00:40:44,137
Here we go.

493
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:56,581
We got eyes on La Quica. He's
traveling in a blue Sedan, heading east.

494
00:40:56,654 --> 00:40:57,712
Go right.

495
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:00,391
Pussies.

496
00:41:16,908 --> 00:41:19,809
He's making a right
on calle cuatro. All units!

497
00:41:19,911 --> 00:41:21,606
Copy that! We're on it!

498
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:27,818
Trujillo, double back on my six.

499
00:41:27,919 --> 00:41:30,411
Perez, close all of 4th street.
Go straight.

500
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:31,819
We'll go this way to cut him off.

501
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:40,958
Come on, pussy.

502
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:50,869
There! Follow him!

503
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:55,305
Follow him! Follow him! Follow him!
To the right, the right!

504
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,782
Come on, box him in!

505
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:00,511
All units, be ready for the play.

506
00:42:17,969 --> 00:42:20,495
Stop!

507
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:22,835
<i>Now I had my own history
with La Quica,</i>

508
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:26,400
<i>and believe me, I would've liked
to beat him to death right then and there.</i>

509
00:42:26,511 --> 00:42:28,206
<i>And I bet nobody would've cared.</i>

510
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,144
<i>La Quica's exploits were legendary.</i>

511
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:34,317
<i>He was Escobar's most prolific killer</i>

512
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:37,878
<i>and the guy credited for putting
the Avianca bomber on the plane.</i>

513
00:42:37,989 --> 00:42:41,721
<i>But he was also his most trusted guy.
And if we could get him to flip...</i>

514
00:42:41,826 --> 00:42:42,884
Fucker.

515
00:42:42,994 --> 00:42:44,860
<i>That would close the book on Pablo.</i>

516
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:29,031
Limón.

517
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:31,599
Relax.

518
00:43:33,978 --> 00:43:35,571
Okay, boss.

519
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:40,312
- Are we ready?
- They're all waiting for us, boss.

520
00:43:40,952 --> 00:43:42,579
I think we have enough.

521
00:43:47,158 --> 00:43:49,320
La Quica isn't answering, boss.

522
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:57,230
Okay.

523
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:02,105
Go start the car.
I'll be there in a second.

524
00:44:02,173 --> 00:44:03,663
Yes, sir.

525
00:45:31,596 --> 00:45:34,031
Where is the staging point
for this raid?

526
00:45:34,098 --> 00:45:36,089
Where's the staging area?

527
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:39,693
You want me to hand you information,
just like that?

528
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:41,101
Free?

529
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:43,705
No, brother.

530
00:45:43,774 --> 00:45:45,003
I want a deal.

531
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:49,536
Then give us Pablo, asshole.

532
00:45:50,281 --> 00:45:52,375
I want something different.

533
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:56,284
I want to start a new life,
in the United States of America.

534
00:45:56,387 --> 00:45:59,755
He says he wants
a new life in the US of A.

535
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:04,858
You give us Pablo Escobar,
and I'll take you there myself.

536
00:46:10,568 --> 00:46:13,731
We don't have time for bullshit.

537
00:46:13,804 --> 00:46:15,966
Blackie already rolled on all of you.

538
00:46:19,744 --> 00:46:23,977
If you don't give us something fast,
of substance,

539
00:46:24,081 --> 00:46:29,884
we'll buy you that ticket
to the United States but extradited.

540
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:33,288
- Extradition doesn't exist.
- Fine, then a jail cell here.

541
00:46:33,891 --> 00:46:37,589
With a sign that says snitch
around your neck.

542
00:46:45,236 --> 00:46:48,331
<i>The narcos always talk
about loyalty...</i>

543
00:46:48,439 --> 00:46:50,601
<i>till their own asses are
on the line.</i>

544
00:47:18,202 --> 00:47:19,169
Quica.

545
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:21,671
Hello. Where are you, boss?

546
00:47:21,772 --> 00:47:24,104
I'm en route, and you?

547
00:47:24,175 --> 00:47:26,041
Me too. I'm not too far off.

548
00:47:30,881 --> 00:47:35,978
I'm almost there, boss.
Are you still far off?

549
00:47:41,492 --> 00:47:43,324
Pass the phone to Ricardo.

550
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:49,133
Boss, Ricardo went to get
one last stash.

551
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,793
He's on his way.

552
00:47:51,669 --> 00:47:55,537
You want me to meet you?
Are you with Limón?

553
00:48:03,414 --> 00:48:05,212
Yes, we're almost there.

554
00:48:15,926 --> 00:48:21,160
You have what you wanted.
He'll be there soon. Limón is driving.

555
00:48:23,534 --> 00:48:25,559
Now give us the staging point.

556
00:48:28,439 --> 00:48:29,838
Pull over.

557
00:48:36,881 --> 00:48:38,440
Give me a moment.

558
00:48:38,549 --> 00:48:39,675
Okay.

559
00:48:40,251 --> 00:48:41,218
Sure, boss.

560
00:48:47,425 --> 00:48:48,859
Tata.

561
00:48:52,863 --> 00:48:53,921
Yes, my love?

562
00:48:54,031 --> 00:48:58,764
I just want you to know
that I love you very much.

563
00:48:58,869 --> 00:49:01,702
You and our children.

564
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:08,071
You may not hear from me for a while.

565
00:49:08,646 --> 00:49:10,546
What's happening, Pablo?

566
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:13,083
What are you going to do?

567
00:49:15,419 --> 00:49:17,251
Something I have to do.

568
00:49:20,157 --> 00:49:26,324
But you know that I will never,
never leave you, right?

569
00:49:28,499 --> 00:49:29,660
I know.

570
00:49:36,006 --> 00:49:37,770
I love you, Tata.

571
00:49:42,146 --> 00:49:44,672
I will always love you, Pablo.

572
00:50:05,870 --> 00:50:09,500
Keep going down that road.
I'll show you the way.

573
00:50:09,607 --> 00:50:10,631
Yes, boss.

574
00:51:03,861 --> 00:51:05,056
Fuck.

575
00:51:08,566 --> 00:51:09,897
I've got something.

576
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,697
Attention all units.
A vehicle is approaching. Be alert.

577
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:14,704
There you are, motherfucker.

578
00:51:34,525 --> 00:51:37,893
Hey, girls.

579
00:51:41,065 --> 00:51:43,033
Negative. They're whores.

580
00:51:46,203 --> 00:51:49,571
It's after nine. He's not showing up.
He's fucking onto us.

581
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:51,369
All right. Let the women through.

582
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:54,036
Stand by, everyone.
This isn't happening tonight.

583
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:55,977
Goddammit.
Almost fucking had him again.

584
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:59,613
- Oh, fuck this!
- Peña, goddammit!

585
00:52:00,217 --> 00:52:02,083
Fire! Let's go! Fire!

586
00:52:29,647 --> 00:52:31,615
What will happen with Quica, boss?

587
00:52:36,253 --> 00:52:37,846
Quica is gone, Limón.

588
00:52:41,625 --> 00:52:43,024
They're all gone.
