1
00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:10,075
This is the entrance
to the temple of Shiva?

2
00:00:10,077 --> 00:00:11,143
Ah! Oh!

3
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:14,079
Dead end.

4
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:20,686
The temple.

5
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:24,323
(Gasps)
Hak foo?

6
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,261
The bands of Shiva.

7
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,465
With these,
I will be unstoppable.

8
00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:34,600
Stop!

9
00:00:34,602 --> 00:00:36,702
Uh, do not take that

10
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:39,772
which does not belong
to you, uh, mortal!

11
00:00:39,774 --> 00:00:41,173
Shiva speaks?

12
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:46,979
With a familiar voice.

13
00:00:46,981 --> 00:00:47,880
Unh!

14
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:50,549
Shiva runs, too.

15
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:59,725
Angry crow
takes flight!

16
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:03,929
Aah!

17
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,607
Rabid hamster
climbs wheel!

18
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:20,612
Whoa!

19
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:25,884
I will get you, chan!

20
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,921
Hak foo really
rolls with the punches.

21
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:27,980
Ok, disappearing spell,

22
00:02:27,982 --> 00:02:30,749
what shall we make
vanish into thin air?

23
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:33,352
Homework?
(Scoffs) I wish.

24
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:36,955
Ming vase?

25
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:38,724
Uh, kinda priceless.

26
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:41,326
Bingo!

27
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,430
Xia xu, xia xu,
xia xu sandwich!

28
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:53,539
I am da bomb!

29
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:57,943
Hak foo seemed
very interested
in having these relics.

30
00:02:57,945 --> 00:03:02,014
And uncle
is very interested
in having his lunch.

31
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,616
Aiyaa!

32
00:03:04,618 --> 00:03:06,985
Tohru!

33
00:03:06,987 --> 00:03:09,521
Did you eat my
mung bean sandwich?

34
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,056
No, sensei.

35
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:13,058
I have been here,
baking cookies.

36
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:14,960
Jade?!

37
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:18,363
Who needs
a sandwich
anyway

38
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:21,166
when you can
have cookies,
huh, uncle?

39
00:03:21,168 --> 00:03:23,368
He who partakes
in dessert before lunch

40
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,838
disturbs good chi
with bad cholesterol.

41
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,740
Uh, perhaps
we should chew on

42
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:30,042
why hak foo
may have wanted

43
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:31,743
shiny new
wristbands?

44
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:33,879
Yours is
not to ask.

45
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:35,414
But to fork
over! Arr!

46
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:49,828
You break it,
you buy it!

47
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:50,896
Sensei?

48
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:55,968
Aah!

49
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:58,103
Oh...

50
00:03:58,105 --> 00:04:01,073
Tohru! I cannot
feel my legs!

51
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:03,809
Give me the bands,
chan.

52
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:16,021
Xia xu, xia xu,
xia xu, hak foo!

53
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:17,589
What?

54
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,325
(Gasps)
Jackie, no!

55
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:27,866
W-what happened?

56
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:30,302
Where am--we?

57
00:04:30,304 --> 00:04:33,305
Geography later.
The bands now!

58
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:35,707
Shoe!

59
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:38,343
No one shoos me--aah!

60
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,550
Jade, echoing:
Uncle! Come quickly!

61
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:47,653
Uncle, echoing: Aiyaa!

62
00:04:47,655 --> 00:04:49,821
Bad dream. Bad dream.

63
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:52,024
Bad dream. Bad dream.
Bad dream!

64
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:58,997
Tohru sat on me,
and my shop is a shambles!

65
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:02,234
Uncle, I used
a disappearing spell
on hak foo.

66
00:05:02,236 --> 00:05:04,770
You are not supposed
to use magic!

67
00:05:04,772 --> 00:05:07,806
Jackie! Your niece
needs a talking to!

68
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,274
Jackie can't
hear you

69
00:05:09,276 --> 00:05:10,776
'cause I disappeared
him, too.

70
00:05:10,778 --> 00:05:12,210
(Gasps) What?!

71
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,347
I can hear you!

72
00:05:15,349 --> 00:05:18,684
Jade! Uncle!
I'm not disappeared!

73
00:05:18,686 --> 00:05:22,020
I'm...Shrunken?

74
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:24,056
Aah!

75
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:29,594
Surely,
there must exist
a counterspell.

76
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:31,296
Most likely.

77
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:33,332
Which spell did you use?

78
00:05:33,334 --> 00:05:36,768
The yeoh cheung archive,
book 3, page 95.

79
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:41,139
And which limbo-like
void did you choose
as the destination?

80
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:42,808
Uh, none.

81
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:46,011
Aiyaa! You must
always choose
a destination

82
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:48,113
when casting
a disappearing
spell.

83
00:05:48,115 --> 00:05:50,382
Jackie could
be anywhere!

84
00:05:50,384 --> 00:05:52,718
I sure hope
it's somewhere with a phone.

85
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,854
Jade! You're a genius!

86
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,224
(Ring)

87
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,230
Uncle's rare finds.
May I help you?

88
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:07,933
Hello?

89
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:15,140
Small or large,
I will take the bands.

90
00:06:15,142 --> 00:06:16,742
Who is it?
Is it Jackie?

91
00:06:16,744 --> 00:06:18,176
Crank call!

92
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:20,212
Come,
we must find
counterspell!

93
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:23,315
Tohru, I will need
eye of wombat.

94
00:06:23,317 --> 00:06:26,151
It's in
the refrigerator beside
the chopped liver.

95
00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:27,986
Bear fishing
for salmon!

96
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:34,659
Aah!

97
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:44,236
Ugh! Augh!
Pee-yuuu!

98
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:53,311
Hmm. Sensei
did not have lunch.

99
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,855
(Very high-pitched)
Tohru!

100
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:07,092
Tohru! It's me! Jackie!

101
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:08,960
Jackie!

102
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:12,097
(Hums to himself)

103
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,001
Monkey climbs vine!

104
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,310
Oh, visual aid.

105
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,885
Tohru! Over here!

106
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:38,023
(Hums to himself)

107
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:41,493
Arr!

108
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:48,867
Aah!

109
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:09,321
Ah-ah-choo!

110
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:15,393
Kangaroo hop!

111
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,434
Ugh! Gah!

112
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:24,369
(Coughs)

113
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:32,711
A chocolate chip?

114
00:08:32,713 --> 00:08:34,846
No. No!

115
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,285
No!
- No!

116
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:48,727
No!
- No!

117
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:00,272
No!
- No!

118
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,744
(Sputtering)

119
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:09,548
Tohru! I need that
wombat eye today!

120
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,218
Uh, oh, coming, sensei.

121
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:16,388
Uh-oh!

122
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:22,827
This counterspell promises
to return that which is lost.

123
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:29,267
Wongai, womai.
Wongai, womai.

124
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:34,272
Come on home, Jackie!

125
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:42,247
I lost this kite
when I was
a young boy.

126
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:44,783
And I have been
looking for this sock.

127
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:47,319
Hello? We're still
short one Jackie.

128
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,123
Waah!

129
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:55,460
Rampaging rhino rams!

130
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:58,296
No rhino!
No ramming!

131
00:09:58,298 --> 00:10:00,899
You're going down, chan!

132
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:02,567
Arr!

133
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:03,702
Huh? Aah!

134
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:32,797
This antidote will
release from detention

135
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:35,400
he who is trapped
in another dimension.

136
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,873
Uh, Jackie?

137
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:47,679
(British accent)
It's just me,
but thank you ever so much

138
00:10:47,681 --> 00:10:50,015
for freeing me
from that beastly limbo.

139
00:10:50,017 --> 00:10:51,316
Not Jackie.

140
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:55,553
(Sniffs)
Ah, lunch!

141
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:57,922
Uh, cookie?

142
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:00,592
What's a cookie?

143
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:03,061
(Roars)

144
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,196
Go away!

145
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:11,202
I must find
another spell.

146
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:12,370
Ya think?

147
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:18,777
I'm on uncle's
spell book.

148
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:23,415
Yes, uncle, right here!

149
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:26,785
Aah!

150
00:11:26,787 --> 00:11:28,953
This is a lousy
spell book.

151
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:44,936
From the deepest reaches
of the void, we compel you.

152
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:50,942
Bring forth our Jackie!

153
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:59,384
Arr! Unh!

154
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:01,720
Let's try a different
kind of spell.

155
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:16,901
Bring forth
a sign of Jackie.

156
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,169
Any sign'll do.

157
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:20,972
I am trying!
I am trying!

158
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:25,477
Arr!

159
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:34,452
It is Jackie
communicating
with us!

160
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:37,055
No! Look at
your computer, Jade!

161
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:38,823
Your computer!

162
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:43,528
Chan!

163
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:47,532
I will help myself
to the bands,

164
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:49,601
after I delete you!

165
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:54,572
Aah!

166
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:56,875
Gazelle bounds
on stepping stones!

167
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,481
Can you ask Jackie
to communicate
with words next time?

168
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:07,552
English words? Oh...

169
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:24,602
Aah!

170
00:13:24,604 --> 00:13:25,503
Huh?

171
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:35,346
Jackie, where are you?

172
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:38,349
I'm here, Jade!

173
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:43,154
Hear?

174
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:47,158
Time to get within
shouting distance.

175
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:01,039
Aah!

176
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:04,342
Excuse me, Jade.

177
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:05,844
No, Jade! Wait!

178
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:12,450
Aah!

179
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:16,521
Aah!

180
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:46,317
Oh, long way up.

181
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:48,987
But I will get someone
to lend me an ear!

182
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:56,027
It's no use, uncle.
These counterspells
are lame-o.

183
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:11,075
Billy goat scales mountain.

184
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,080
(Mutters to himself)

185
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:20,285
What?

186
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:22,520
These pages
are stuck together.

187
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:30,028
Jade, you have used
half of one spell

188
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,529
and half of another.

189
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:35,166
Combined, these spells
would not disappear Jackie,

190
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:39,103
they would shrink him
to the size of an ant.

191
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:42,373
Great! That means he's
somewhere in...Here.

192
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,910
Aah! Watch your step!

193
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:48,413
Check your shoes!

194
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:58,690
Tohru!

195
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:10,468
Toh--unh!

196
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:20,912
Hot cha! I will
bring Jackie back
in a Hong Kong minute.

197
00:16:20,914 --> 00:16:23,314
That's what you said
4 counterspells ago.

198
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,750
Antidote for
disappearing spell: Hard.

199
00:16:25,752 --> 00:16:28,252
Shrink spell? Easy.

200
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:30,922
Hurry, uncle.

201
00:16:30,924 --> 00:16:34,058
No, wait!
I cannot return
to normal size in here!

202
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:48,106
Behold the bands of Shiva!

203
00:16:57,383 --> 00:17:00,018
Uh, yes, they're
very pretty, hak foo.

204
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,453
But please, if we
do not leave here fast,

205
00:17:02,455 --> 00:17:04,956
tohru will be
in grave danger.

206
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:06,891
So I heard.

207
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:10,261
I shall defeat
my 2 greatest enemies today.

208
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:11,929
Yah!

209
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:18,503
Ow!

210
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:23,975
Ah!

211
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:46,097
Arr!

212
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:51,302
Spider eats fly!

213
00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:53,037
Spider eats earwax!

214
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:01,746
I--I hear voices.
Jackie's voice.

215
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:04,582
Screaming about--
about spiders!

216
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:07,285
Uh, don't
lose your head
now, tohru.

217
00:18:07,287 --> 00:18:09,087
Jackie'll
be home soon.

218
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:10,655
Kwai jong,
kwai jong,
kwai jong.

219
00:18:10,657 --> 00:18:11,756
Oh!

220
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:17,395
Unh!

221
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:45,289
Ooh!
- Ooh!

222
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,859
Uncle: Kwai jong,
kwai jong,
kwai jong.

223
00:18:47,861 --> 00:18:50,428
No, uncle!
Stop the spell!

224
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,633
Kwai jong, kwai jong,
kwai jong, kwai jong.

225
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:56,767
All done.

226
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:01,305
Tohru! You must
stop uncle!

227
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,207
I am inside your head!

228
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:04,742
Aah!

229
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:08,346
(Gasps) Sensei!

230
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:10,915
Jackie says
he is inside my head.

231
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:13,751
(Gasps) There is no room
to grow inside there.

232
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:15,553
You mean
tohru's head is
gonna go scanner?

233
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,557
I cannot reverse
the incantation.

234
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:31,335
Ah-ah-ah-choo!

235
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:34,505
Jackie!

236
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,607
Gesundheit!

237
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:38,409
Ah, relief.

238
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:40,344
(Groans)

239
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:45,249
Uh, new haircut, hak foo?

240
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:46,918
New arms.

241
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,787
To tear you
limb from limb.

242
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:50,922
Uncle, may I?

243
00:19:50,924 --> 00:19:52,790
Only this once.

244
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:54,859
Xia xu, xia xu,
xia xu, xia xu.

245
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:56,027
Hak foo!

246
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:57,929
Aw, not again!

247
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:04,735
Good work, Jade.

248
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:06,837
Aw, not really.
I was trying to
make him disappear.

249
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,310
Hello? Kidding!

250
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:21,052
Hey, Jackie?
Yes?

251
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:23,020
What's your favorite sport?

252
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:24,922
The basketball
is the best.

253
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:26,824
It's the best

254
00:20:26,826 --> 00:20:29,660
...and you're sweating,
and techniques, good.

255
00:20:29,662 --> 00:20:32,897
And movement,
and the mind,
in that second,

256
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:34,932
what are you doing?
Ok, back up--

257
00:20:34,934 --> 00:20:37,034
that's basketball.

258
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:39,237
Wow. You gonna--
chi-chung.

259
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:40,905
Huh?

260
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:44,075
I can beat
Michael Jordan.
Maybe, I don't know.

261
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,611
With my
martial arts together.

262
00:20:46,613 --> 00:20:48,579
Poom! Chlan!
