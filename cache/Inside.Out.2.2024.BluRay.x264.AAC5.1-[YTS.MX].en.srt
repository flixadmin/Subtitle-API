1
00:01:20,132 --> 00:01:24,094
Let's play some hockey!

2
00:01:30,767 --> 00:01:34,271
This is Joy, coming to you live
in Riley's mind...

3
00:01:34,437 --> 00:01:38,941
and we are expecting a great championship
today with the Foghorns.

4
00:01:39,109 --> 00:01:41,028
Riley fans, get up on your feet...

5
00:01:41,194 --> 00:01:44,031
and make some noise!

6
00:01:44,447 --> 00:01:45,448
Go, go, go!

7
00:01:45,615 --> 00:01:47,367
Let's go, Foghorns!

8
00:01:49,202 --> 00:01:50,203
Bring it in!

9
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:51,621
Foghorns on three.

10
00:01:51,788 --> 00:01:53,956
- One, two, three...
- Foghorns!

11
00:02:01,548 --> 00:02:06,511
Now, it's time to greet your Team Riley!

12
00:02:06,678 --> 00:02:09,847
Playing in his 13th year,
and fresh from the penalty box...

13
00:02:10,015 --> 00:02:11,849
it's Riley's Anger!

14
00:02:12,017 --> 00:02:13,018
Let me at 'em!

15
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,944
Helmet, pads, gloves...

16
00:02:23,111 --> 00:02:25,280
safety checklist is complete.

17
00:02:25,447 --> 00:02:27,740
It should be nothing
but smooth sailing from...

18
00:02:27,907 --> 00:02:29,117
Look out!

19
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,537
And that's Fear, keeping Riley on her toes.

20
00:02:32,704 --> 00:02:34,956
We gotta get our mouth guard, people.

21
00:02:36,499 --> 00:02:38,543
No, no, no! That's not ours!

22
00:02:39,586 --> 00:02:41,963
And that, folks, is the infamous Disgust.

23
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:43,465
Glad to have her on our team.

24
00:02:46,008 --> 00:02:47,969
Twenty-eight. Andersen, tripping.

25
00:02:48,136 --> 00:02:49,346
<i>Oh, no...</i>

26
00:02:49,512 --> 00:02:51,014
And bringing up the rear...

27
00:02:51,181 --> 00:02:52,765
you know her, you love her...

28
00:02:52,932 --> 00:02:55,185
the one, the only...

29
00:02:55,352 --> 00:02:57,354
We got a penalty.

30
00:02:57,812 --> 00:03:00,940
That's right, Sadness is in the house!

31
00:03:01,108 --> 00:03:02,109
Yay...

32
00:03:02,275 --> 00:03:04,152
<i>Andersen goes to the box.</i>

33
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,528
<i>Two minutes for tripping.</i>

34
00:03:05,695 --> 00:03:09,282
<i>Okay, looks like we have a couple of minutes
while Riley takes a breather.</i>

35
00:03:09,449 --> 00:03:10,450
<i>Let me catch you up.</i>

36
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:13,328
<i>Riley is still exceptional.</i>

37
00:03:13,495 --> 00:03:14,496
Ta-da!

38
00:03:14,662 --> 00:03:15,663
Yum.

39
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,790
<i>And not just because
she's the top of her class...</i>

40
00:03:17,957 --> 00:03:19,834
<i>- Riley Andersen.
- ...which, by the way, she is.</i>

41
00:03:20,001 --> 00:03:21,419
Riley, Riley, over here!

42
00:03:21,586 --> 00:03:23,880
<i>She's also really kind...</i>

43
00:03:24,047 --> 00:03:26,091
<i>and she's nice to stray cats.</i>

44
00:03:26,258 --> 00:03:27,384
<i>I mean, come on.</i>

45
00:03:27,925 --> 00:03:30,470
{\an8}<i>And she's officially a teenager now.</i>

46
00:03:30,637 --> 00:03:32,472
<i>She got very tall, very fast.</i>

47
00:03:32,722 --> 00:03:34,432
<i>Did we grow overnight?</i>

48
00:03:34,932 --> 00:03:37,269
<i>That was our favorite shirt.</i>

49
00:03:37,435 --> 00:03:40,730
<i>We even got braces with extra rubber bands!</i>

50
00:03:40,897 --> 00:03:42,565
- How does it feel?
- Great!

51
00:03:43,066 --> 00:03:43,983
Sorry.

52
00:03:44,151 --> 00:03:47,695
<i>Riley's Personality Islands
are still going strong.</i>

53
00:03:47,862 --> 00:03:50,365
Glad to see Boy Band Island
finally broke up.

54
00:03:50,532 --> 00:03:52,867
But Goofball is still monkeying around.

55
00:03:53,451 --> 00:03:54,952
Wait, where's Family Island?

56
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,538
It's right there.

57
00:03:58,123 --> 00:03:59,582
There it is.

58
00:03:59,749 --> 00:04:01,793
What's that blocking it?

59
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:03,086
That's Friendship Island.

60
00:04:03,253 --> 00:04:04,546
Isn't it amazing?

61
00:04:04,712 --> 00:04:09,051
<i>But we realized her islands
aren't the only things made by memories.</i>

62
00:04:09,217 --> 00:04:14,347
<i>Way down, at the root level,
these memories were also creating beliefs.</i>

63
00:04:14,514 --> 00:04:16,432
<i>Homework should be illegal.</i>

64
00:04:17,975 --> 00:04:20,895
<i>Get Up and Glow is the best band ever!</i>

65
00:04:21,062 --> 00:04:22,897
<i>And my personal favorite...</i>

66
00:04:23,065 --> 00:04:24,566
<i>I'm a really good friend.</i>

67
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:29,529
Did you know the change in your couch
could change the world? Oh, no!

68
00:04:34,034 --> 00:04:35,368
Oh, no, we should do something.

69
00:04:35,535 --> 00:04:37,412
No! That girl is a social <i>Titanic.</i>

70
00:04:37,579 --> 00:04:38,580
Do not get on that ship.

71
00:04:39,289 --> 00:04:40,498
Guys...

72
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:42,250
Wow.

73
00:04:43,668 --> 00:04:45,920
That is so pretty.

74
00:04:48,965 --> 00:04:52,010
It's okay. I drop things all the time.

75
00:04:55,972 --> 00:04:57,224
I'm Riley.

76
00:04:57,849 --> 00:04:59,142
I'm Grace.

77
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,103
I'm Bree.

78
00:05:03,021 --> 00:05:05,107
<i>Turns out, when you put
all of those beliefs together...</i>

79
00:05:05,273 --> 00:05:07,692
<i>they make the most wonderful thing of all.</i>

80
00:05:07,859 --> 00:05:09,486
<i>Her Sense of Self.</i>

81
00:05:09,819 --> 00:05:11,404
<i>I'm a good person.</i>

82
00:05:11,571 --> 00:05:14,241
<i>It's what helps Riley make good choices.</i>

83
00:05:15,075 --> 00:05:16,701
<i>Thirteen years of hard work...</i>

84
00:05:16,868 --> 00:05:20,997
<i>all wrapped up in what some might call
our masterpiece.</i>

85
00:05:21,164 --> 00:05:23,166
<i>You know, one of the hardest challenges
we found...</i>

86
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:24,542
<i>Oh, my gosh! We're back in the game.</i>

87
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,129
<i>We're tied.</i>

88
00:05:27,295 --> 00:05:28,588
How are we gonna score in time?

89
00:05:28,755 --> 00:05:32,008
- We use our slap shot!
- No, no, no. We charge the goalie!

90
00:05:32,175 --> 00:05:34,261
But Grace hasn't scored yet.

91
00:05:36,304 --> 00:05:37,514
Riley's got this.

92
00:05:40,683 --> 00:05:42,352
Thread the needle!

93
00:05:43,895 --> 00:05:45,063
Come on, Riley.

94
00:06:11,214 --> 00:06:12,465
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about!

95
00:06:12,632 --> 00:06:14,259
Look at that! That's my girl!

96
00:06:14,426 --> 00:06:17,262
<i>And the Foghorns win the championship!</i>

97
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,727
- She shoots and she scores!
- Champions, baby!

98
00:06:24,894 --> 00:06:25,895
Hey, girls.

99
00:06:26,063 --> 00:06:27,772
Congratulations on your win.

100
00:06:27,939 --> 00:06:29,566
That's the high school coach!

101
00:06:30,358 --> 00:06:31,776
What a game!

102
00:06:31,943 --> 00:06:33,153
That last play?

103
00:06:33,695 --> 00:06:35,613
The three of you were impressive.

104
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,989
Thanks, Coach Roberts.

105
00:06:37,157 --> 00:06:38,366
Look, it's last minute...

106
00:06:38,533 --> 00:06:41,493
{\an8}but every year, I do a three-day skills camp.

107
00:06:41,494 --> 00:06:43,413
I invite all the best players in the area.

108
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,498
I'd love for you girls to come.

109
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:47,584
Are we in a dream right now?

110
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,211
Please, can somebody pinch me?

111
00:06:50,503 --> 00:06:51,504
Definitely awake.

112
00:06:51,671 --> 00:06:55,175
If we impress Coach, she'll put
the three of us on the team next year.

113
00:06:55,342 --> 00:06:56,551
The Fire Hawks!

114
00:06:56,718 --> 00:06:59,387
Finally, a team I can get behind.

115
00:06:59,554 --> 00:07:00,763
What do you say?

116
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:02,265
- Yes!
- Absolutely yes.

117
00:07:02,432 --> 00:07:03,516
- We're there!
- Thank you, thank you, thank you!

118
00:07:03,683 --> 00:07:05,435
Great. We'll see you tomorrow.

119
00:07:06,186 --> 00:07:07,270
This is amazing!

120
00:07:12,984 --> 00:07:14,569
What a big day!

121
00:07:14,736 --> 00:07:16,113
You are such an all-star!

122
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:18,490
You are gonna knock the coach's skates off!

123
00:07:18,656 --> 00:07:21,826
- Hockey scholarship, here we come!
- Dad, stop.

124
00:07:21,993 --> 00:07:23,578
It's just hockey camp.

125
00:07:23,745 --> 00:07:25,872
I mean, who knows what'll happen?

126
00:07:29,167 --> 00:07:31,169
<i>Twenty-eight. Andersen, tripping.</i>

127
00:07:31,836 --> 00:07:34,547
My penalty almost lost us the game today.

128
00:07:34,714 --> 00:07:36,633
What if I get to camp and I screw it up?

129
00:07:36,799 --> 00:07:38,135
Hey, don't talk like that.

130
00:07:38,301 --> 00:07:40,345
Yeah, you did great today, honey.

131
00:07:40,512 --> 00:07:42,430
Exactly. Mom gets it.

132
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,266
Yeah, I guess...

133
00:07:44,432 --> 00:07:46,226
We're so proud of you.

134
00:07:46,393 --> 00:07:47,394
Night, monkey.

135
00:07:48,186 --> 00:07:49,562
All right, all right.

136
00:07:49,729 --> 00:07:51,189
Sleep tight, honey.

137
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:59,364
Riley's so hard on herself.

138
00:07:59,531 --> 00:08:01,491
But we can make everything easier.

139
00:08:03,118 --> 00:08:07,122
Behold, my super high-tech
Riley protection system.

140
00:08:09,207 --> 00:08:10,375
Don't look, it's fine.

141
00:08:10,542 --> 00:08:14,296
This is for all those memories that belong
in the Back of the Mind...

142
00:08:14,462 --> 00:08:16,048
like this penalty one.

143
00:08:16,214 --> 00:08:18,883
It's weighing on her,
so let's lighten the load.

144
00:08:19,051 --> 00:08:20,843
A one-way expressway to...

145
00:08:21,011 --> 00:08:23,180
"We're not gonna think about that right now."

146
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:27,600
- Not bad.
- Joy.

147
00:08:27,767 --> 00:08:28,893
- That's pretty impressive.
- You worked hard.

148
00:08:29,061 --> 00:08:31,229
You take such good care of Riley.

149
00:08:31,396 --> 00:08:32,480
Thanks, I try.

150
00:08:32,939 --> 00:08:34,316
Okay, let's do a sweep.

151
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:39,071
Here's one where she waved at a guy
who was actually waving at a girl behind her.

152
00:08:39,571 --> 00:08:41,238
That was so bad. Good choice.

153
00:08:41,948 --> 00:08:43,825
Here's when she forgot that girl's name.

154
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:44,992
Yeah, that was super awkward.

155
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,204
- What was her name?
- I don't know, Janet or something?

156
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:48,621
Whatever. Let's just get rid of it.

157
00:08:49,622 --> 00:08:53,210
We keep the best and toss the rest.

158
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:54,877
Nice work, everyone.

159
00:08:55,045 --> 00:08:57,714
All right, Anger, the rest of these babies
can go to long-term.

160
00:09:05,222 --> 00:09:06,764
Okay. Let's get some shut-eye.

161
00:09:06,931 --> 00:09:08,391
Big day tomorrow.

162
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:19,819
Joy, are you taking that
where I think you're taking that?

163
00:09:19,986 --> 00:09:21,988
- Wanna come this time?
- Yes.

164
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,115
I mean no. I...

165
00:09:23,281 --> 00:09:25,742
Oh, no. I really shouldn't.

166
00:09:25,908 --> 00:09:28,786
You know, you're the only one
who hasn't been to the Belief System.

167
00:09:28,953 --> 00:09:32,290
Yeah, it's just that it's new,
and I know how important it is.

168
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:35,502
And I don't wanna mess it up or break it...

169
00:09:35,668 --> 00:09:37,962
or burn it to the ground or anything.

170
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:40,548
Sadness, you won't hurt it, I promise.

171
00:09:40,715 --> 00:09:42,175
Have I ever steered you wrong before?

172
00:09:42,342 --> 00:09:44,136
Yeah, many times.

173
00:09:44,302 --> 00:09:45,428
Come on.

174
00:09:46,763 --> 00:09:48,973
Where I go, you go.

175
00:10:13,706 --> 00:10:16,084
Oh, my goodness.

176
00:10:48,241 --> 00:10:50,285
<i>Mom and Dad are proud of me.</i>

177
00:10:50,452 --> 00:10:52,079
An oldie but a goodie.

178
00:10:54,414 --> 00:10:55,457
<i>I'm kind.</i>

179
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:57,917
That's nice.

180
00:10:59,669 --> 00:11:01,129
<i>I'm strong. I'm brave.</i>

181
00:11:01,296 --> 00:11:02,672
<i>I'm a really good friend.</i>

182
00:11:20,523 --> 00:11:21,524
<i>I'm a winner.</i>

183
00:11:22,442 --> 00:11:27,197
<i>And all those beliefs come together
to make our Riley.</i>

184
00:11:27,364 --> 00:11:28,781
<i>I'm a good person.</i>

185
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:56,476
What the heck is that?

186
00:12:17,289 --> 00:12:18,498
Turn that off, Joy!

187
00:12:18,665 --> 00:12:20,917
People, it's the apocalypse!

188
00:12:21,084 --> 00:12:22,085
No!

189
00:12:22,252 --> 00:12:23,461
What are you doing?

190
00:12:36,766 --> 00:12:38,310
Problem solved.

191
00:12:38,476 --> 00:12:39,311
Joy.

192
00:12:44,482 --> 00:12:46,443
Okay, let's clear it all out.

193
00:12:46,609 --> 00:12:48,528
It's demo day.

194
00:12:50,613 --> 00:12:51,614
Demo?

195
00:12:51,781 --> 00:12:53,116
Wait, wait, what's happening?

196
00:12:53,283 --> 00:12:55,035
What's going on?

197
00:12:58,121 --> 00:12:59,122
Who are you people?

198
00:13:03,293 --> 00:13:04,836
{\an8}Hey, are you the one in charge here?

199
00:13:06,003 --> 00:13:08,631
{\an8}Could you do me a favor
and stop tearing Headquarters apart?

200
00:13:08,798 --> 00:13:10,007
No can do. Didn't you hear?

201
00:13:10,175 --> 00:13:11,218
{\an8}Permits just came through.

202
00:13:11,384 --> 00:13:12,844
{\an8}Permits? For what?

203
00:13:13,011 --> 00:13:14,304
{\an8}For expanding the place.

204
00:13:14,471 --> 00:13:15,930
{\an8}You know, for the others.

205
00:13:17,057 --> 00:13:18,058
What others?

206
00:13:18,225 --> 00:13:19,226
They're not here yet?

207
00:13:20,435 --> 00:13:22,145
Hey, Margie, you got that console?

208
00:13:22,312 --> 00:13:24,022
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Give me a sec!

209
00:13:24,189 --> 00:13:25,065
Hey, hey! What are you doing?

210
00:13:25,232 --> 00:13:27,150
- All right. She's all set.
- Set with what?

211
00:13:27,317 --> 00:13:28,735
<i>Come on, Riley. Get up.</i>

212
00:13:28,901 --> 00:13:30,112
Camp time.

213
00:13:30,695 --> 00:13:32,155
Lunch break!

214
00:13:33,323 --> 00:13:35,033
Wait, wait! You can't leave it like this.

215
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,576
Don't worry, we'll be back.

216
00:13:36,743 --> 00:13:37,827
<i>Come on. We're gonna be late.</i>

217
00:13:37,994 --> 00:13:39,704
- Oh, no, no, no!
<i>- Let's go!</i>

218
00:13:42,499 --> 00:13:44,709
Riley, you aren't packed yet?

219
00:13:46,753 --> 00:13:48,004
You're always on me!

220
00:13:48,171 --> 00:13:50,882
Can't you just lay off for,
like, one second?

221
00:13:51,508 --> 00:13:52,509
Overreact much?

222
00:13:52,675 --> 00:13:53,968
I barely touched it.

223
00:13:54,136 --> 00:13:56,013
Those morons broke the console.

224
00:13:56,179 --> 00:13:58,015
Riley, what's wrong?

225
00:13:58,681 --> 00:14:00,225
Mom looks sad.

226
00:14:00,392 --> 00:14:02,435
I'm the worst!

227
00:14:02,602 --> 00:14:04,187
Oh, no. Honey.

228
00:14:04,354 --> 00:14:05,688
I barely touched it.

229
00:14:05,855 --> 00:14:06,981
That's what I said.

230
00:14:11,736 --> 00:14:13,780
Let the professional handle this.

231
00:14:15,365 --> 00:14:19,702
I'm too gross to go to camp or anywhere
ever again!

232
00:14:20,203 --> 00:14:21,704
Oh, yeah, this is totally broken.

233
00:14:22,872 --> 00:14:24,916
Well, we all knew this day would come.

234
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:27,544
Remember, we agreed not to make
a big deal about this.

235
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:29,046
But she really does stink.

236
00:14:29,212 --> 00:14:30,088
It's bad.

237
00:14:30,255 --> 00:14:33,175
Remain calm.
Stick to the prepared script.

238
00:14:33,341 --> 00:14:35,593
You are not gross, honey.

239
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,804
You're just changing.

240
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:41,099
Remember that beautiful butterfly we saw
in the park last week?

241
00:14:41,266 --> 00:14:43,643
<i>- Well, that butterfly began as a caterpillar.</i>
- Easy...

242
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:44,894
<i>And just like that caterpillar...</i>

243
00:14:45,062 --> 00:14:47,147
- Easy...
<i>- ...you're about to get your wings.</i>

244
00:14:47,314 --> 00:14:49,107
- But if you have questions...
- Oh, my gosh, Mom!

245
00:14:49,274 --> 00:14:50,483
Just go away!

246
00:14:52,152 --> 00:14:55,030
Well, that's a preview of the next 10 years.

247
00:14:55,655 --> 00:14:56,906
- Riley!
- Oh, my gosh!

248
00:14:57,074 --> 00:14:58,491
- We're gonna have so much fun!
- All right.

249
00:14:58,658 --> 00:15:00,452
Who's ready for hockey camp?

250
00:15:00,618 --> 00:15:01,661
Yeah!

251
00:15:01,828 --> 00:15:03,205
<i>Okay, until we can figure this out...</i>

252
00:15:03,538 --> 00:15:06,208
nobody touch the console
unless you really need to.

253
00:15:07,834 --> 00:15:10,420
So, big weekend for us.
What do you wanna do?

254
00:15:10,587 --> 00:15:13,965
Well, we could finally clean out the garage.
Or, actually, we can get upstairs...

255
00:15:14,216 --> 00:15:16,218
How great is next year gonna be?

256
00:15:16,384 --> 00:15:19,721
Coach Roberts' team has been state champs
like every year.

257
00:15:20,097 --> 00:15:23,391
And Val Ortiz is the captain now.

258
00:15:23,558 --> 00:15:26,519
This Valentina Ortiz obsession
is outta control.

259
00:15:26,686 --> 00:15:29,189
She made the Fire Hawks
when she was only a freshman.

260
00:15:29,356 --> 00:15:31,066
That's really hard.

261
00:15:31,233 --> 00:15:33,235
All we have to do is be super awesome
at camp...

262
00:15:33,401 --> 00:15:37,239
Coach will put us on the team,
and we'll all be Fire Hawks!

263
00:15:38,073 --> 00:15:39,574
- Wait, what was that?
- What was what?

264
00:15:39,741 --> 00:15:41,618
We got a look. I don't like this.

265
00:15:41,784 --> 00:15:43,036
What? You're paranoid.

266
00:15:43,203 --> 00:15:44,287
I never miss a look.

267
00:15:47,499 --> 00:15:49,167
Enhance 224... 176.

268
00:15:49,334 --> 00:15:50,960
Track right. Zoom in.

269
00:15:51,378 --> 00:15:53,463
Right there!

270
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,590
- So?
- She's hiding something.

271
00:15:55,757 --> 00:15:57,008
But what?

272
00:15:59,677 --> 00:16:00,678
What is she doing?

273
00:16:00,845 --> 00:16:02,014
She's looking at our look!

274
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:04,891
No, it's much more than that.

275
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:08,561
She looks the same to me.

276
00:16:08,728 --> 00:16:10,063
Overlay and compare.

277
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:13,900
See? Riley then, Riley now.
Riley then, Riley now.

278
00:16:14,067 --> 00:16:15,485
It's so obvious!

279
00:16:15,652 --> 00:16:16,736
But what does it mean?

280
00:16:17,487 --> 00:16:19,531
She knows we're hiding something.

281
00:16:21,449 --> 00:16:22,617
What is happening right now?

282
00:16:22,784 --> 00:16:23,660
I don't know! I don't know!

283
00:16:23,826 --> 00:16:25,328
I can't take this anymore!

284
00:16:26,038 --> 00:16:27,622
You spilled the tea!

285
00:16:27,955 --> 00:16:29,624
Coach Roberts isn't gonna be our coach
next year.

286
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:30,792
Grace!

287
00:16:34,171 --> 00:16:36,048
We got assigned to a different high school.

288
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,426
Oh, no.

289
00:16:40,635 --> 00:16:41,636
Okay.

290
00:16:41,886 --> 00:16:43,513
Yeah. No big deal.

291
00:16:44,306 --> 00:16:45,682
- This is a huge deal!
- Our life is over!

292
00:16:45,848 --> 00:16:46,891
Is she serious right now?

293
00:16:47,059 --> 00:16:48,351
- How long have they known this?
- I can't breathe.

294
00:16:48,518 --> 00:16:49,519
We can't go to high school...

295
00:16:49,686 --> 00:16:51,521
- without Bree and Grace.
- We won't know anybody.

296
00:16:51,688 --> 00:16:52,897
We'll still get to hang out.

297
00:16:53,065 --> 00:16:54,607
And we'll have this weekend...

298
00:16:54,774 --> 00:16:57,652
which means we'll get one last time playing
on the same team.

299
00:16:57,819 --> 00:16:59,654
Friends are forever, right?

300
00:17:00,488 --> 00:17:02,615
Yeah. Of course.

301
00:17:03,825 --> 00:17:05,160
I can't wait to get to the rink.

302
00:17:05,326 --> 00:17:08,788
- When do we get our schedules?
- I heard our room has a view...

303
00:17:08,954 --> 00:17:10,706
This is so sad.

304
00:17:10,873 --> 00:17:12,375
No, wait, Sadness!

305
00:17:12,542 --> 00:17:13,918
- No, no, no! Don't!
- I don't have a good grip!

306
00:17:14,127 --> 00:17:15,961
Just keep it together
until we're out of the car.

307
00:17:17,213 --> 00:17:18,214
Here we are.

308
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:20,883
This looks really cool.

309
00:17:21,051 --> 00:17:23,678
{\an8}Are you sure you don't need
an assistant coach? 'Cause I am available.

310
00:17:23,844 --> 00:17:25,096
- Bill!
- No? All right.

311
00:17:25,263 --> 00:17:26,764
- We'll see you in a few days.
- Have fun!

312
00:17:26,931 --> 00:17:27,973
- Thanks so much. Bye!
- Don't miss us too much.

313
00:17:28,141 --> 00:17:29,851
- Okay, bye!
- Wait. Riley...

314
00:17:30,018 --> 00:17:31,311
are you sure you have everything?

315
00:17:31,478 --> 00:17:32,395
- Stick?
- Yes.

316
00:17:32,562 --> 00:17:33,438
- Gloves?
- Yes.

317
00:17:33,605 --> 00:17:34,814
- You have your phone?
- Yes, of course.

318
00:17:34,981 --> 00:17:36,483
- Fully charged?
- Yeah, it's like 50.

319
00:17:36,649 --> 00:17:37,650
- What?
- Dad, it's fine.

320
00:17:37,817 --> 00:17:39,361
Okay, call us if you need us.

321
00:17:39,527 --> 00:17:40,528
I love you. Go get 'em.

322
00:17:40,695 --> 00:17:41,738
Okay. Love you guys.

323
00:17:41,904 --> 00:17:44,032
- Don't forget the deodorant!
- Mom!

324
00:17:44,241 --> 00:17:45,242
Bye, monkey.

325
00:17:47,577 --> 00:17:49,912
Okay, now.

326
00:17:55,001 --> 00:17:57,295
It's okay. We need this.

327
00:18:03,051 --> 00:18:05,012
<i>Guys, these are high-schoolers.</i>

328
00:18:05,387 --> 00:18:07,180
We do not wanna be red and puffy, do we?

329
00:18:07,347 --> 00:18:08,181
No.

330
00:18:08,348 --> 00:18:11,768
Don't worry, we'll have plenty of time
to think about this after camp.

331
00:18:11,976 --> 00:18:14,062
<i>Now, where did Bree and Grace go?</i>

332
00:18:14,937 --> 00:18:15,938
- There they are.
- Wait.

333
00:18:16,106 --> 00:18:18,066
Aren't those traitors dead to us?

334
00:18:18,233 --> 00:18:19,942
Our best friends? No.

335
00:18:22,404 --> 00:18:23,280
Hey!

336
00:18:24,239 --> 00:18:25,240
Are you okay?

337
00:18:26,408 --> 00:18:28,535
Everybody act regular. It's Valentina Ortiz.

338
00:18:28,701 --> 00:18:29,744
We gotta say something.

339
00:18:31,163 --> 00:18:31,996
Hey.

340
00:18:32,372 --> 00:18:34,707
- Hi. I'm Val...
- I know. You're the varsity captain...

341
00:18:34,874 --> 00:18:36,501
you set the all-time goal record
as a junior...

342
00:18:36,668 --> 00:18:37,752
your favorite color's red,
and your skates...

343
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:38,920
What are we saying?

344
00:18:39,087 --> 00:18:40,255
We are so uncool.

345
00:18:40,422 --> 00:18:42,215
Why are we still holding her hand?

346
00:18:42,382 --> 00:18:43,508
Just like me.

347
00:18:44,467 --> 00:18:45,968
You're the one Coach told us about.

348
00:18:46,136 --> 00:18:47,887
Riley, from Michigan, right?

349
00:18:48,055 --> 00:18:49,556
- It's Minnesota, sweetie.
- No, no, no.

350
00:18:49,722 --> 00:18:51,974
We cannot correct Val Ortiz.

351
00:18:53,393 --> 00:18:54,519
Yeah, that's me.

352
00:18:54,686 --> 00:18:57,105
Riley from good old Michigan.

353
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,899
Orange? Who made the console orange?

354
00:19:00,067 --> 00:19:01,651
- Do I look orange?
- I didn't touch it.

355
00:19:01,818 --> 00:19:03,236
- Orange is not my color.
- Not me.

356
00:19:03,986 --> 00:19:05,488
Hello, everybody.

357
00:19:06,448 --> 00:19:08,825
Oh, my gosh. I am just such a huge fan
of yours.

358
00:19:08,991 --> 00:19:11,828
And now, here I am,
meeting you, face to face.

359
00:19:12,579 --> 00:19:13,788
Okay. How can I help?

360
00:19:14,247 --> 00:19:15,415
I can take notes, get coffee...

361
00:19:15,582 --> 00:19:16,666
manage your calendar, walk your dog...

362
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:18,335
carry your things, watch you sleep.

363
00:19:18,501 --> 00:19:21,129
Wow! You have a lot of energy.

364
00:19:21,629 --> 00:19:23,131
Maybe you could just stay in one place.

365
00:19:23,298 --> 00:19:24,174
Anything.

366
00:19:24,341 --> 00:19:25,800
Just call my name, and I am here for you.

367
00:19:26,008 --> 00:19:27,010
Okay, love that.

368
00:19:27,177 --> 00:19:28,428
And what was your name again?

369
00:19:28,595 --> 00:19:30,055
I'm sorry. I can get ahead of myself.

370
00:19:30,222 --> 00:19:31,056
I'm Anxiety.

371
00:19:31,223 --> 00:19:32,515
I'm one of Riley's new emotions.

372
00:19:32,682 --> 00:19:34,809
And we are just super-jazzed to be here.

373
00:19:34,976 --> 00:19:36,186
Where can I put my stuff?

374
00:19:36,644 --> 00:19:38,146
What do you mean "we"?

375
00:19:38,855 --> 00:19:41,274
I wish I was as tall as all of you.

376
00:19:41,441 --> 00:19:42,734
Who the heck are you?

377
00:19:43,651 --> 00:19:44,819
I'm Envy.

378
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,114
Look at your hair.

379
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,448
Oh, yeah, not happening.

380
00:19:49,282 --> 00:19:50,575
Look at her hair!

381
00:19:50,742 --> 00:19:52,702
We need hair like that.

382
00:19:52,869 --> 00:19:55,330
Oh, my gosh. I love the red in your hair.

383
00:19:56,706 --> 00:19:58,166
What are you doing?

384
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:02,129
Hey, maybe when I make the team,
I can join Team Redhead, too!

385
00:20:02,295 --> 00:20:03,130
Yeah, yeah.

386
00:20:06,841 --> 00:20:08,176
Okay, who's this guy?

387
00:20:08,343 --> 00:20:10,053
What's your name, big fella?

388
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,346
That's Embarrassment.

389
00:20:11,513 --> 00:20:14,807
He's not really big on eye contact,
or like, good talking...

390
00:20:14,974 --> 00:20:16,268
but he's a really sweet guy.

391
00:20:16,434 --> 00:20:19,604
Well, welcome to Headquarters, Embarrassment.

392
00:20:19,771 --> 00:20:21,356
We're doing a... No.

393
00:20:21,523 --> 00:20:22,565
No, going high.

394
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,402
You got a real sweaty palm there, buddy.

395
00:20:26,778 --> 00:20:28,405
Hey, do you wanna come with me, actually?

396
00:20:28,571 --> 00:20:29,822
You can meet some of the other Fire Hawks.

397
00:20:29,989 --> 00:20:30,990
<i>This is exciting.</i>

398
00:20:31,158 --> 00:20:33,285
But we can't let her know we're excited.

399
00:20:33,993 --> 00:20:35,328
Yeah, sounds good.

400
00:20:35,495 --> 00:20:36,829
What emotion was that?

401
00:20:36,996 --> 00:20:38,040
That's Ennui.

402
00:20:38,206 --> 00:20:39,332
An-what?

403
00:20:40,042 --> 00:20:41,251
Ennui.

404
00:20:41,418 --> 00:20:43,878
It's what you would call the boredom.

405
00:20:44,046 --> 00:20:46,631
Well, come on up here, An-wer.

406
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:47,965
Am I saying it right?

407
00:20:48,133 --> 00:20:49,551
An-wah. No.

408
00:20:49,717 --> 00:20:51,553
Nicknames! I'm gonna call you Wee-Wee.

409
00:20:51,719 --> 00:20:52,887
No.

410
00:20:53,471 --> 00:20:54,806
How are you driving?

411
00:20:54,972 --> 00:20:56,266
Console app.

412
00:20:56,641 --> 00:20:58,393
Hey! Stop it! That's enough.

413
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,437
Now, now, I know new emotions...

414
00:21:00,603 --> 00:21:03,315
can sometimes feel unhelpful at first...

415
00:21:03,481 --> 00:21:04,524
and you just wanna...

416
00:21:05,483 --> 00:21:07,485
say to them,
"Why are you so annoying?"

417
00:21:08,111 --> 00:21:12,407
But I've learned that every emotion
is good for Riley.

418
00:21:12,907 --> 00:21:14,034
Even this turkey.

419
00:21:14,701 --> 00:21:16,411
Okay, fine.

420
00:21:17,787 --> 00:21:18,871
Cool. Lead the way.

421
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,041
All right. Grab your stuff and follow me.

422
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:22,750
<i>But what about our friends?</i>

423
00:21:22,917 --> 00:21:24,586
<i>Val is our future.</i>

424
00:21:24,752 --> 00:21:26,088
Yes, I agree completely.

425
00:21:26,254 --> 00:21:29,466
We need new friends or else
we'll be totally alone in high school.

426
00:21:29,632 --> 00:21:30,633
- Right, Joy?
- Well...

427
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,968
- I mean, maybe...
- Here we go!

428
00:21:32,135 --> 00:21:32,969
Wait up.

429
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:35,013
Thanks for showing me around.

430
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,306
Wait, why did you do that?

431
00:21:36,473 --> 00:21:37,765
Sorry. What did I do?

432
00:21:37,932 --> 00:21:39,601
We just left our best friends behind.

433
00:21:39,767 --> 00:21:41,561
But what about the new ones
that we're about to meet?

434
00:21:41,728 --> 00:21:42,562
No. Okay.

435
00:21:42,729 --> 00:21:45,607
These next three days need to be
about Bree and Grace.

436
00:21:45,773 --> 00:21:49,986
Joy, the next three days could determine
the next four years of our lives.

437
00:21:50,612 --> 00:21:52,989
Now, I think that's overstating things a bit.

438
00:21:53,531 --> 00:21:55,325
Joy is so old school.

439
00:21:55,492 --> 00:21:56,326
What?

440
00:21:56,493 --> 00:21:57,910
Look, we all have a job to do.

441
00:21:58,078 --> 00:21:59,246
You make Riley happy...

442
00:21:59,412 --> 00:22:00,247
Sadness makes her sad...

443
00:22:00,413 --> 00:22:02,665
Fear protects her from the scary stuff
she can see...

444
00:22:02,832 --> 00:22:06,128
and my job is to protect her
from the scary stuff she can't see.

445
00:22:06,294 --> 00:22:08,171
I plan for the future.

446
00:22:08,505 --> 00:22:10,132
I can show you.
You're gonna love this.

447
00:22:13,301 --> 00:22:14,761
I was using that as a cup holder.

448
00:22:14,927 --> 00:22:17,055
Okay, so my team has run all the data...

449
00:22:17,222 --> 00:22:19,516
and we're looking at the following
likely scenarios.

450
00:22:19,682 --> 00:22:22,769
First, we don't take this camp seriously,
and we goof off with Bree and Grace.

451
00:22:22,935 --> 00:22:25,272
Riley looks really uncool in front of Val.

452
00:22:25,438 --> 00:22:27,857
She fails to impress the coach,
does not become a Fire Hawk...

453
00:22:28,025 --> 00:22:29,651
and finally arrives at high school.

454
00:22:29,817 --> 00:22:31,069
She has no one.

455
00:22:31,236 --> 00:22:34,364
She eats alone,
and only the teachers know her name.

456
00:22:34,614 --> 00:22:36,033
Okay, you and I are gonna be friends.

457
00:22:36,408 --> 00:22:38,410
This is a sad story.

458
00:22:38,576 --> 00:22:40,370
It's a ridiculous story.

459
00:22:40,537 --> 00:22:43,081
Look, again, love the energy,
but you're being silly.

460
00:22:43,248 --> 00:22:44,791
None of this will actually happen.

461
00:22:44,957 --> 00:22:46,126
Right. Whatever you say.

462
00:22:46,293 --> 00:22:47,377
You're the boss.

463
00:22:47,794 --> 00:22:51,423
Remember when we all finally came up
to Headquarters?

464
00:22:51,589 --> 00:22:54,217
That was like 30 seconds ago, Nostalgia.

465
00:22:54,384 --> 00:22:56,386
Yeah, those were the days.

466
00:22:56,553 --> 00:22:59,014
Nostalgia, you aren't supposed
to be here yet.

467
00:22:59,181 --> 00:23:01,516
You still have about 10 years,
two graduations...

468
00:23:01,683 --> 00:23:03,143
and a best friend's wedding
before you're invited...

469
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:04,894
but I will keep you in the loop, I promise.

470
00:23:05,062 --> 00:23:07,272
<i>- All right, you ready, Riley?</i>
- Hey, hey, everybody focus!

471
00:23:07,439 --> 00:23:09,649
Val is leading us
into their holy inner sanctum!

472
00:23:09,816 --> 00:23:11,151
And here we are!

473
00:23:14,071 --> 00:23:16,864
<i>These girls are so cool!</i>

474
00:23:17,032 --> 00:23:17,990
<i>And older.</i>

475
00:23:18,158 --> 00:23:19,367
We are not changing in front of them.

476
00:23:19,534 --> 00:23:20,577
It's fine!

477
00:23:20,743 --> 00:23:22,329
<i>Locker rooms are places
of mutual respect.</i>

478
00:23:22,495 --> 00:23:24,831
Hey, come on! I want you to meet
the other Fire Hawks.

479
00:23:24,997 --> 00:23:25,915
- Hey, girl!
- What's up?

480
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:27,209
Hey.

481
00:23:27,375 --> 00:23:28,835
Riley is from Michigan.

482
00:23:29,001 --> 00:23:31,003
Okay, we're stuck with that.

483
00:23:31,171 --> 00:23:32,964
Cool. Where in Michigan are you from?

484
00:23:33,673 --> 00:23:34,674
Oh, no. What now?

485
00:23:34,841 --> 00:23:36,676
Okay, looks like we're committing to this.

486
00:23:36,843 --> 00:23:37,969
Cities in Michigan...

487
00:23:38,136 --> 00:23:39,179
We need to make something up.

488
00:23:39,346 --> 00:23:41,556
I'm from all over.

489
00:23:41,723 --> 00:23:43,225
Nice. See you out there.

490
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,726
Hey, you wanna sit with us?

491
00:23:45,143 --> 00:23:46,353
<i>She wants to sit with us.</i>

492
00:23:47,312 --> 00:23:48,855
Everything is beautiful!

493
00:23:49,022 --> 00:23:51,024
There's not enough room for Bree and Grace.

494
00:23:51,483 --> 00:23:52,734
Let's go sit over there.

495
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,694
I was gonna go save seats
for my friends.

496
00:23:54,861 --> 00:23:56,238
But thanks anyway.

497
00:23:57,239 --> 00:23:58,281
Yeah. Okay.

498
00:23:58,448 --> 00:23:59,282
No worries.

499
00:23:59,449 --> 00:24:01,159
See? Was that so hard?

500
00:24:01,326 --> 00:24:02,285
No. You're totally right.

501
00:24:02,452 --> 00:24:05,288
That decision's not gonna haunt us
for the rest of our lives at all.

502
00:24:05,705 --> 00:24:07,915
- No way!
- Bree and Grace!

503
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:09,376
- There you are.
- Riley.

504
00:24:09,542 --> 00:24:12,254
Time to celebrate!

505
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,421
Say...

506
00:24:14,714 --> 00:24:17,134
Okay, ladies. Let's all settle in.

507
00:24:21,054 --> 00:24:22,055
Joy?

508
00:24:22,222 --> 00:24:23,765
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Ladies!

509
00:24:23,931 --> 00:24:25,975
Settle in means settle down.

510
00:24:26,518 --> 00:24:27,560
I need your focus.

511
00:24:27,727 --> 00:24:30,022
Which means now I'm going to need
your cell phones.

512
00:24:30,188 --> 00:24:31,064
All of 'em.

513
00:24:34,151 --> 00:24:37,654
You're here to work, not goof around.

514
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:38,863
Got that, Andersen?

515
00:24:40,573 --> 00:24:41,574
Yes, Coach.

516
00:24:41,741 --> 00:24:43,826
Please put all your phones in the basket.

517
00:24:43,993 --> 00:24:45,745
You get them back at the end of camp.

518
00:24:47,997 --> 00:24:51,126
Wow. Coach is so serious.

519
00:24:51,293 --> 00:24:53,461
Joy, I'm just curious.
Maybe I could help...

520
00:24:53,628 --> 00:24:54,629
Thank you. Not now.

521
00:24:54,796 --> 00:24:55,963
I know, right?

522
00:24:58,758 --> 00:25:00,010
You think this is funny?

523
00:25:00,593 --> 00:25:01,803
Well, you know what else is funny?

524
00:25:01,969 --> 00:25:03,013
Skating lines.

525
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,639
Now hit the ice, ladies.

526
00:25:04,931 --> 00:25:06,808
- Great job, Michigan.
- Thanks a lot, new girl.

527
00:25:06,974 --> 00:25:08,185
Just make her do it.

528
00:25:09,477 --> 00:25:12,064
Bravo, Joy. She's totally fitting in now.

529
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:14,066
Thanks so much, Wee-Wee.

530
00:25:17,944 --> 00:25:19,654
You're lagging behind, Andersen!

531
00:25:19,821 --> 00:25:21,739
- Skate harder!
- This is the worst.

532
00:25:22,907 --> 00:25:24,992
All right, ladies, take a breather.

533
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,953
Then we'll divide into teams.

534
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,545
That Michigan girl is off to a rough start.

535
00:25:35,712 --> 00:25:36,546
<i>Oh, no.</i>

536
00:25:36,713 --> 00:25:37,922
Are they talking about us?

537
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:41,259
Yeah, there's no way Coach is putting her
on the team if she can't get it together.

538
00:25:41,426 --> 00:25:44,554
Okay, Dani, like you had it all
together when you were a freshman?

539
00:25:44,721 --> 00:25:45,972
I wasn't that immature.

540
00:25:46,139 --> 00:25:50,310
Dani, you stuck straws up your nose.
Like last night.

541
00:25:54,564 --> 00:25:56,233
I got you, big guy.

542
00:25:59,027 --> 00:26:02,530
I always wanted people to talk about us,
but not like this.

543
00:26:02,697 --> 00:26:04,657
Joy, what do we do now?

544
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:07,077
We can just...

545
00:26:07,244 --> 00:26:08,495
I have an idea.

546
00:26:08,661 --> 00:26:09,496
Okay.

547
00:26:09,662 --> 00:26:13,416
If we can get Val on our side,
everything will be great.

548
00:26:18,213 --> 00:26:19,214
Val?

549
00:26:19,381 --> 00:26:20,590
Hey, Riley. What's up?

550
00:26:23,593 --> 00:26:24,969
I'm so sorry.

551
00:26:25,137 --> 00:26:27,055
I didn't mean to get the whole team
skating lines.

552
00:26:27,222 --> 00:26:28,265
I feel terrible.

553
00:26:28,431 --> 00:26:29,599
I respect you so much.

554
00:26:29,766 --> 00:26:31,101
I would never do anything to mess you up.

555
00:26:31,268 --> 00:26:32,602
That's laying it on a bit thick,
don't you think?

556
00:26:32,769 --> 00:26:33,770
- Joy.
<i>- You're a great hockey player...</i>

557
00:26:33,936 --> 00:26:35,438
and you lead the team so amazingly...

558
00:26:35,605 --> 00:26:37,399
- and I really look up to you and...
- Okay, okay.

559
00:26:37,565 --> 00:26:38,566
Thanks.

560
00:26:38,733 --> 00:26:41,194
Listen, Coach was pretty hard on you today...

561
00:26:41,361 --> 00:26:42,820
but that's not a bad thing.

562
00:26:42,987 --> 00:26:44,322
It means you're on her radar.

563
00:26:44,489 --> 00:26:45,365
Really?

564
00:26:45,532 --> 00:26:47,325
Listen, I'm glad you came to talk with me.

565
00:26:47,492 --> 00:26:49,494
Hey, let's try to be on the same team later, okay?

566
00:26:49,661 --> 00:26:51,079
Yeah. Cool.

567
00:26:51,246 --> 00:26:52,164
Wow.

568
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:53,873
- Good job. Wow.
- I wish I could do that.

569
00:26:54,041 --> 00:26:56,209
You guys, I mean, it really wasn't anything.

570
00:26:56,376 --> 00:26:57,794
I'm just trying to help.

571
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,337
I agree.

572
00:26:59,504 --> 00:27:01,631
Great job, Anxiety.

573
00:27:01,798 --> 00:27:03,758
I stepped back, you stepped in...

574
00:27:03,925 --> 00:27:06,636
you got Riley back on track,
now I'm ready to step back in.

575
00:27:06,803 --> 00:27:08,430
But that was just part one of my plan.

576
00:27:08,596 --> 00:27:09,681
There's a part two?

577
00:27:09,847 --> 00:27:12,309
A good plan has many parts, Joy.

578
00:27:12,475 --> 00:27:15,228
Okay, ladies, we're gonna form your teams
for the rest of camp.

579
00:27:15,395 --> 00:27:16,688
Now, split yourselves down the middle.

580
00:27:16,854 --> 00:27:19,857
Team one on the right, team two on the left.

581
00:27:20,025 --> 00:27:20,942
Let's do this!

582
00:27:21,109 --> 00:27:22,402
One more time on the same team, right?

583
00:27:22,569 --> 00:27:23,570
Right.

584
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:26,781
Val wants us.

585
00:27:26,948 --> 00:27:28,491
But we promised Bree and Grace.

586
00:27:28,658 --> 00:27:30,452
Joy, we have to plan for the future.

587
00:27:33,288 --> 00:27:34,997
Come on, Riley, move. Move those feet!

588
00:27:35,165 --> 00:27:36,333
Val's on team one, you wanna be on team one.

589
00:27:36,499 --> 00:27:37,417
Let's go.

590
00:27:37,584 --> 00:27:39,169
She made a promise to her friends.

591
00:27:39,336 --> 00:27:41,003
She's not gonna break it.

592
00:27:41,171 --> 00:27:42,505
You're so right, Joy.

593
00:27:44,341 --> 00:27:45,383
- What are you doing?
- Hey!

594
00:27:46,551 --> 00:27:48,970
No! You can't have that.
Put that back.

595
00:27:52,057 --> 00:27:53,391
- Joy, I don't mean to overstep...
- No!

596
00:27:53,558 --> 00:27:55,768
- ...but it has to be done.
- What are you... No!

597
00:28:04,819 --> 00:28:05,820
No...

598
00:28:06,113 --> 00:28:08,448
I know change is scary, but watch.

599
00:28:10,575 --> 00:28:12,577
I'm so excited.

600
00:28:14,371 --> 00:28:16,331
All right.
Welcome to our team, Michigan.

601
00:28:23,046 --> 00:28:24,464
That is not Riley.

602
00:28:24,631 --> 00:28:25,965
I know. It's a better Riley.

603
00:28:26,133 --> 00:28:28,426
A Riley who won't be alone next year.

604
00:28:28,593 --> 00:28:30,345
We build her a new Sense of Self.

605
00:28:30,678 --> 00:28:32,514
A brand-new her.

606
00:28:33,181 --> 00:28:34,016
No, no, no!

607
00:28:34,182 --> 00:28:35,350
You can't go down there with that.

608
00:28:35,517 --> 00:28:37,644
Over my dead flaming body!

609
00:28:39,354 --> 00:28:40,855
I am truly sorry.

610
00:28:41,023 --> 00:28:43,191
I was so looking forward
to working with you guys.

611
00:28:43,775 --> 00:28:46,111
- Hey, hey! What do you think you're doing?
- Get off me!

612
00:28:46,278 --> 00:28:47,529
Riley's life is more complex now.

613
00:28:47,695 --> 00:28:50,365
It requires more sophisticated emotions
than all of you.

614
00:28:50,532 --> 00:28:52,950
You just aren't what she needs anymore, Joy.

615
00:28:54,036 --> 00:28:55,537
How dare you, madam!

616
00:28:55,703 --> 00:28:57,497
You can't just bottle us up!

617
00:28:58,081 --> 00:28:59,207
That's a great idea.

618
00:29:00,625 --> 00:29:02,294
I can't breathe. I can't breathe!

619
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,629
It's not forever.
It's just until Riley makes varsity...

620
00:29:04,796 --> 00:29:06,631
or until she turns 18, or maybe forever.

621
00:29:06,798 --> 00:29:07,799
I don't know. We'll have to see.

622
00:29:07,965 --> 00:29:09,176
- Bye!
- Anxiety!

623
00:29:09,342 --> 00:29:10,843
Riley needs us!

624
00:29:11,886 --> 00:29:12,720
Okay.

625
00:29:12,887 --> 00:29:14,722
Don't worry, Riley. You're in good hands.

626
00:29:14,889 --> 00:29:17,059
Now let's change everything about you.

627
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:29,654
Quick question. How do we
build a new Riley...

628
00:29:29,821 --> 00:29:31,864
which I'm loving, by the way,
amazing concept...

629
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:35,327
if it took them 13 years
to build the old one?

630
00:29:35,493 --> 00:29:37,537
Well, good news is
we're not starting from scratch.

631
00:29:38,746 --> 00:29:39,831
I wanna plant one.

632
00:29:39,997 --> 00:29:40,998
Next time.

633
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:50,967
<i>If I'm a Fire Hawk, I won't be alone.</i>

634
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,394
No, no, no!

635
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:03,313
Let us out now!

636
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,398
No, stop! Stop! Let us out!

637
00:30:05,565 --> 00:30:07,567
Joy...

638
00:30:15,283 --> 00:30:18,703
We're gonna be in here forever.

639
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:24,792
Where are you putting us?

640
00:30:24,959 --> 00:30:26,836
The same place we keep
all of Riley's secrets.

641
00:30:27,003 --> 00:30:28,046
We're not secrets.

642
00:30:28,213 --> 00:30:29,631
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
"We're not secrets.

643
00:30:29,797 --> 00:30:31,341
"We're making a big mistake."

644
00:30:31,508 --> 00:30:32,842
Never heard that before.

645
00:30:36,804 --> 00:30:39,682
We are suppressed emotions!

646
00:30:40,058 --> 00:30:41,768
Let us out! Right now!

647
00:30:41,934 --> 00:30:43,728
No, no, no. Riley's gonna be fine.

648
00:30:43,895 --> 00:30:45,063
Totally fine.

649
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:47,774
Hey, there. You know what we call that?

650
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:48,983
Denial.

651
00:30:49,151 --> 00:30:50,610
Can you say denial?

652
00:30:51,444 --> 00:30:52,529
Hi, friends.

653
00:30:52,862 --> 00:30:56,574
Welcome. It's so good to have you here
with us today.

654
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,660
It's Bloofy!

655
00:30:58,826 --> 00:31:00,745
From that preschool show Riley used to like?

656
00:31:00,912 --> 00:31:02,039
That's right!

657
00:31:02,205 --> 00:31:03,956
And here's a little secret.

658
00:31:05,667 --> 00:31:08,045
Riley still likes the show.

659
00:31:08,628 --> 00:31:10,838
<i>Stomp like an elephant
Scurry like a mouse</i>

660
00:31:11,005 --> 00:31:13,550
<i>Make your way down to Bloofy's house!</i>

661
00:31:13,716 --> 00:31:14,801
Please kill me.

662
00:31:14,967 --> 00:31:17,012
Bloofy, we're in a real pickle.

663
00:31:17,179 --> 00:31:18,805
Could you help us get out of here?

664
00:31:19,806 --> 00:31:21,724
We're gonna need your help.

665
00:31:21,891 --> 00:31:23,685
Can you find a way out?

666
00:31:24,769 --> 00:31:26,104
Who are you talking to?

667
00:31:26,271 --> 00:31:27,147
My friends.

668
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:29,441
Do you see a key?

669
00:31:32,152 --> 00:31:33,611
I don't either.

670
00:31:33,778 --> 00:31:34,821
Okay, we're doomed.

671
00:31:34,987 --> 00:31:35,863
Indeed.

672
00:31:36,323 --> 00:31:39,409
Welcome to your eternal fate.

673
00:31:40,035 --> 00:31:41,536
Lance Slashblade?

674
00:31:41,703 --> 00:31:43,621
But he's a video game character.

675
00:31:43,788 --> 00:31:44,831
Why is he here?

676
00:31:44,997 --> 00:31:47,417
Yeah, I always thought Riley
had a secret crush on him.

677
00:31:47,584 --> 00:31:49,127
I never saw the appeal.

678
00:31:49,294 --> 00:31:51,338
I long to be a hero...

679
00:31:51,504 --> 00:31:54,006
but darkness haunts my past.

680
00:31:54,174 --> 00:31:56,468
- I get it.
- I'm in a hundred percent.

681
00:31:59,054 --> 00:32:00,055
Who's that?

682
00:32:00,222 --> 00:32:02,807
That's Riley's Deep Dark Secret.

683
00:32:02,974 --> 00:32:04,767
What is the secret?

684
00:32:05,768 --> 00:32:06,853
You don't wanna know.

685
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:10,773
Riley's secrets, a rogue emotion
has taken over Headquarters.

686
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,734
Now, if you could just open the jar...

687
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,777
Hey, kids, let's learn some Latin.

688
00:32:14,944 --> 00:32:16,696
Do you know <i>quid pro quo?</i>

689
00:32:16,863 --> 00:32:20,075
We get you out of that jar,
then you get us out of this safe.

690
00:32:20,242 --> 00:32:21,243
No, Bloofy.

691
00:32:21,409 --> 00:32:23,911
Their destiny is not ours to change.

692
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:25,622
We were all banished here...

693
00:32:25,788 --> 00:32:28,250
deemed unfit, worthless.

694
00:32:28,958 --> 00:32:30,335
Don't you dare say that.

695
00:32:30,502 --> 00:32:32,754
You do not deserve to be thrown away.

696
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,921
One second, Lance.

697
00:32:34,089 --> 00:32:36,341
Don't you remember his power move?

698
00:32:36,508 --> 00:32:37,925
I'm coming for you, Riley!

699
00:32:38,093 --> 00:32:40,012
Oh, yeah? Watch this!

700
00:32:41,554 --> 00:32:42,764
Come on!

701
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:44,516
You listen to me, Lance Slashblade.

702
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,684
No one is totally worthless.

703
00:32:46,851 --> 00:32:49,979
But I am a warrior cursed
with a feeble attack.

704
00:32:50,147 --> 00:32:53,400
Then you must make your curse your gift.

705
00:32:54,692 --> 00:32:56,486
Shield yourself, my friends...

706
00:32:56,653 --> 00:32:59,072
for I shall set you all free!

707
00:33:03,951 --> 00:33:04,952
Hey, little help?

708
00:33:08,623 --> 00:33:09,957
Great job, Dark Secret.

709
00:33:11,043 --> 00:33:12,960
Now it's your turn to help us.

710
00:33:13,128 --> 00:33:15,713
My pouch has just the thing
to get us out of here.

711
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:19,551
Everybody say, "Oh, Pouchy!"

712
00:33:20,343 --> 00:33:22,595
Oh, Pouchy!

713
00:33:24,972 --> 00:33:27,434
Hi, everybody. I'm Pouchy.

714
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,227
Pouchy, we need to escape.

715
00:33:29,394 --> 00:33:31,063
Do you have anything that can help us?

716
00:33:31,229 --> 00:33:32,689
I have lots of items.

717
00:33:33,065 --> 00:33:35,108
Which one do you think will work the best?

718
00:33:35,275 --> 00:33:36,484
A tomato...

719
00:33:36,651 --> 00:33:37,819
a frog...

720
00:33:37,985 --> 00:33:40,030
or exploding dynamite?

721
00:33:40,197 --> 00:33:41,614
Oh, for crying out loud.

722
00:33:43,866 --> 00:33:45,952
Yay! We did it, everyone!

723
00:33:46,119 --> 00:33:48,705
Let's all sing the "We did it" song.

724
00:33:48,871 --> 00:33:49,747
No time!

725
00:33:50,498 --> 00:33:51,791
Thank you, friends.

726
00:33:52,792 --> 00:33:55,002
I must be leaving you.

727
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:57,464
What about Dark Secret?

728
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:00,758
Not yet.

729
00:34:01,968 --> 00:34:03,803
Yeah, that's probably best for everybody.

730
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:06,139
Hey! Who let you out? Get back in there!

731
00:34:06,306 --> 00:34:07,765
- Oh, boy.
- What are we gonna do?

732
00:34:07,932 --> 00:34:08,975
Oh disgusted one...

733
00:34:09,684 --> 00:34:13,896
as you once believed in me,
I will now believe in myself.

734
00:34:19,361 --> 00:34:20,778
Wait. What?

735
00:34:29,996 --> 00:34:31,706
What's happening?

736
00:34:36,002 --> 00:34:37,003
No...

737
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:38,171
Dave, help! Help!

738
00:34:38,338 --> 00:34:39,339
Hold on!

739
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:40,840
Dave!

740
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,052
Lance!

741
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:45,220
Goodbye, friends.

742
00:34:45,387 --> 00:34:47,014
Hello, destiny!

743
00:34:47,764 --> 00:34:49,099
Well, there's a lid for every pot.

744
00:34:49,266 --> 00:34:50,267
Come on!

745
00:34:52,185 --> 00:34:53,478
What do we do? What do we do?

746
00:34:53,645 --> 00:34:55,438
Whoa, Anger, stop.
Where are you going?

747
00:34:55,605 --> 00:34:58,191
Back to Headquarters...
to help Riley!

748
00:34:58,358 --> 00:34:59,692
Riley's not up there.

749
00:34:59,859 --> 00:35:01,319
She's out there.

750
00:35:01,486 --> 00:35:04,197
We can't go back
without her Sense of Self.

751
00:35:04,364 --> 00:35:07,534
You want us to go all the way
to the Back of the Mind?

752
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,619
Are you out of your mind?

753
00:35:09,786 --> 00:35:11,038
But, Joy, how will we...

754
00:35:11,204 --> 00:35:12,205
- Freeze!
- Come on!

755
00:35:12,372 --> 00:35:13,373
Hold it right there!

756
00:35:15,458 --> 00:35:18,045
How do we get there?
Do you even have a plan, Joy?

757
00:35:18,211 --> 00:35:20,755
I bet Anxiety would have
a really good plan...

758
00:35:20,922 --> 00:35:22,715
Of course I have a plan.
Who doesn't have a plan?

759
00:35:22,882 --> 00:35:25,177
Look, she's not the only one
who can project the future.

760
00:35:25,343 --> 00:35:27,429
First, all we have to do is...

761
00:35:28,721 --> 00:35:29,722
<i>Give me a second.</i>

762
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,725
<i>Follow the stream of consciousness...</i>

763
00:35:32,892 --> 00:35:35,770
<i>and then we take a nice, easy float
all the way to the Back of the Mind.</i>

764
00:35:35,937 --> 00:35:37,730
<i>- Where all the bad memories are.
- Exactly.</i>

765
00:35:37,897 --> 00:35:40,650
<i>And there, we'll find the Riley
we know and love.</i>

766
00:35:41,234 --> 00:35:44,904
<i>We'll put her Sense of Self back,
and then Riley will be Riley again.</i>

767
00:35:45,072 --> 00:35:47,199
<i>Okay, I'm gonna give it to you.
That could actually work.</i>

768
00:35:47,365 --> 00:35:48,366
<i>Yeah, it could!</i>

769
00:35:48,533 --> 00:35:52,579
<i>And then I tell Anxiety,
"Hey, don't worry so much anymore."</i>

770
00:35:52,745 --> 00:35:56,458
<i>And she'll say, "Wow, Joy, I never thought
of that before. Thank you."</i>

771
00:35:56,624 --> 00:35:57,834
<i>And then we hug and become best friends...</i>

772
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,752
<i>And then I punt her into the dump.</i>

773
00:36:00,587 --> 00:36:01,588
What? No, Anger.

774
00:36:01,754 --> 00:36:03,673
Okay, fine. No punting.

775
00:36:05,092 --> 00:36:07,094
Don't worry,
I know right where the stream is.

776
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,886
Sadness and I have been here before.

777
00:36:10,138 --> 00:36:11,723
Joy, this is a dead end.

778
00:36:11,889 --> 00:36:14,184
Those are the worst kinds of ends!

779
00:36:14,351 --> 00:36:17,729
Everything's changing so fast!

780
00:36:17,895 --> 00:36:19,064
So, we're lost.

781
00:36:19,231 --> 00:36:21,691
No. You're never lost if you're having fun.

782
00:36:21,858 --> 00:36:22,984
No one is having fun, Joy.

783
00:36:23,151 --> 00:36:24,694
Oh, come on! Look at Sadness.

784
00:36:24,861 --> 00:36:26,529
She's having a great time.

785
00:36:27,822 --> 00:36:29,324
I thought you knew where you were going.

786
00:36:29,491 --> 00:36:30,492
I do. I did.

787
00:36:30,658 --> 00:36:32,119
- I just need a moment.
- She doesn't know.

788
00:36:32,285 --> 00:36:33,578
We're stuck here!

789
00:36:34,912 --> 00:36:36,331
Riley's awake.

790
00:36:36,498 --> 00:36:38,750
Wait, she's up too early.
What are they doing to her?

791
00:36:39,042 --> 00:36:40,793
Come on, we'll find another way.

792
00:36:42,337 --> 00:36:44,464
Don't worry, Riley.
We're coming.

793
00:36:51,554 --> 00:36:53,681
Why are we up so early?

794
00:36:53,848 --> 00:36:56,101
Because, <i>mon ami,</i>
we need to speed things up...

795
00:36:56,268 --> 00:36:57,602
and that means we hit the ice early...

796
00:36:57,769 --> 00:37:00,397
<i>and practice
like we've never practiced before.</i>

797
00:37:00,563 --> 00:37:02,107
<i>Aren't we already good at hockey?</i>

798
00:37:02,274 --> 00:37:03,108
<i>We're good.</i>

799
00:37:03,275 --> 00:37:04,817
But the Fire Hawks are great.

800
00:37:04,984 --> 00:37:05,818
That's right!

801
00:37:09,572 --> 00:37:11,824
<i>Every time we miss,
we skate a lap around the rink.</i>

802
00:37:11,991 --> 00:37:13,951
Hockey is not a game, it is a sport.

803
00:37:25,505 --> 00:37:26,839
- Yes!
<i>- Wow.</i>

804
00:37:27,174 --> 00:37:28,341
That was amazing.

805
00:37:28,508 --> 00:37:31,594
We need to be that good every time.
Let's run it again.

806
00:37:31,761 --> 00:37:33,846
Hey, I see I'm not the only one
who likes to start early.

807
00:37:34,014 --> 00:37:34,931
<i>You guys, it's Val!</i>

808
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,308
We had the same idea.

809
00:37:36,474 --> 00:37:39,186
We're basically the same person.
We're gonna be best friends.

810
00:37:39,352 --> 00:37:40,728
How long have you been here?

811
00:37:40,895 --> 00:37:42,689
I don't know. Maybe an hour.

812
00:37:42,855 --> 00:37:45,108
I just wanted to get in some extra ice time.

813
00:37:45,275 --> 00:37:46,318
I'm the same way.

814
00:37:46,484 --> 00:37:48,153
<i>Oh, my gosh. She gets us.</i>

815
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,322
See? I told the other girls
you'd figure it out.

816
00:37:50,488 --> 00:37:52,574
You get what it takes to be the best.

817
00:37:54,951 --> 00:37:56,036
Look at us.

818
00:37:56,203 --> 00:37:57,870
This is going great!

819
00:37:58,038 --> 00:38:00,540
Yeah! But we need Val
to really like us.

820
00:38:00,915 --> 00:38:02,667
We should ask Val lots of questions.

821
00:38:02,834 --> 00:38:04,544
People love talking about themselves.

822
00:38:04,711 --> 00:38:07,714
So, what was your freshman year
on the Fire Hawks like?

823
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,467
I mean, it was a lot of work...

824
00:38:10,633 --> 00:38:12,094
like, a lot...

825
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:14,304
but it's also how I met my best friends.

826
00:38:14,471 --> 00:38:16,473
Val is sharing things with us!

827
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:18,725
Hey, a few of us are just gonna
hang out tonight...

828
00:38:18,891 --> 00:38:20,893
order some food.
You should come.

829
00:38:21,061 --> 00:38:23,146
An exclusive invitation.

830
00:38:23,313 --> 00:38:24,314
We're going!

831
00:38:24,772 --> 00:38:25,940
- Really?
- Definitely.

832
00:38:26,108 --> 00:38:27,109
It'll be fun.

833
00:38:27,275 --> 00:38:28,985
All right, ladies, let's warm up.

834
00:38:30,653 --> 00:38:31,654
Hey, Riley.

835
00:38:31,821 --> 00:38:32,655
Hi.

836
00:38:32,822 --> 00:38:34,907
We are not sharing Val with them.

837
00:38:35,075 --> 00:38:36,826
Early mornings make me so hungry.

838
00:38:36,993 --> 00:38:38,078
I know, right?

839
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:40,705
I'd give anything for a piece
of pizza right now.

840
00:38:40,872 --> 00:38:41,706
Yes!

841
00:38:41,873 --> 00:38:43,625
See? I told you I'd find it.

842
00:38:43,791 --> 00:38:45,168
The Stream of Consciousness.

843
00:38:45,335 --> 00:38:47,920
- But, Joy...
- Wow! Our girl is hungry.

844
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:49,256
Hop on something delicious!

845
00:38:49,422 --> 00:38:50,757
- Joy...
- Deep dish.

846
00:38:51,258 --> 00:38:52,509
And it's still warm.

847
00:38:52,675 --> 00:38:54,052
Extra cheese, baby!

848
00:38:54,219 --> 00:38:55,095
Sadness, come on.

849
00:38:55,262 --> 00:38:56,638
But I've been trying to tell you.

850
00:38:56,804 --> 00:38:58,848
We can't take the tube back, Joy.

851
00:38:59,182 --> 00:39:01,726
Someone has to be at the console
to recall us.

852
00:39:01,893 --> 00:39:03,853
She's right. We'd be stranded.

853
00:39:04,021 --> 00:39:05,355
Yeah. Anxiety would have thought about that.

854
00:39:05,522 --> 00:39:06,814
Well, I doubt it. Fine.

855
00:39:06,981 --> 00:39:07,982
Okay...

856
00:39:08,733 --> 00:39:11,486
So, someone's
gonna have to crawl up that tube...

857
00:39:11,653 --> 00:39:12,904
and go back to Headquarters...

858
00:39:13,071 --> 00:39:14,906
and at the right moment, bring us back.

859
00:39:15,073 --> 00:39:16,449
I'll do it. I'll pound that...

860
00:39:16,616 --> 00:39:17,700
I don't think so, punty.

861
00:39:17,867 --> 00:39:19,577
- Okay, here's the thing.
- You were never an option.

862
00:39:19,744 --> 00:39:20,578
Thank you.

863
00:39:20,745 --> 00:39:22,872
You want me to crawl through a tube in this?

864
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,332
Yeah, not happening.

865
00:39:27,127 --> 00:39:29,962
Oh, no, not me.

866
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:31,839
Yes! Sadness, you could do it.

867
00:39:32,006 --> 00:39:34,134
You know the console better than anybody.

868
00:39:34,301 --> 00:39:36,178
You've read the manuals cover to cover.

869
00:39:36,344 --> 00:39:37,762
I mean, you say that...

870
00:39:37,929 --> 00:39:41,224
but I know a lot less
about Manual 28, Chapter Seven...

871
00:39:41,391 --> 00:39:44,769
"How to Recall Non-Memory Objects"
than most folks realize.

872
00:39:44,936 --> 00:39:46,438
You've proven my point for me, Sadness.

873
00:39:46,604 --> 00:39:47,647
That sounds like a yes.

874
00:39:47,814 --> 00:39:49,816
<i>Where is everybody? You on break again?</i>

875
00:39:50,275 --> 00:39:52,110
Walkie-talkies. Here. Check-check-check.

876
00:39:52,277 --> 00:39:53,403
Can you hear me? I gotta press a button.

877
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:55,822
<i>Go for Joy. Copy that. Over.</i> I love 'em!

878
00:39:56,073 --> 00:39:57,240
We'll signal you
when we get there...

879
00:39:57,407 --> 00:39:58,616
and then you bring us back.

880
00:39:59,451 --> 00:40:01,411
Sadness, it's the fastest way
back to Headquarters.

881
00:40:01,578 --> 00:40:02,579
Joy, I can't do it.

882
00:40:02,745 --> 00:40:04,997
I'm not strong like you are.

883
00:40:05,165 --> 00:40:06,541
I know you, Sadness.

884
00:40:06,708 --> 00:40:08,251
You are strong.

885
00:40:08,418 --> 00:40:11,088
I can't give you
specific examples right now...

886
00:40:11,254 --> 00:40:12,630
but you got this.

887
00:40:15,092 --> 00:40:16,968
Just don't look down and keep moving.

888
00:40:17,135 --> 00:40:18,720
Yeah, I can do it.

889
00:40:21,848 --> 00:40:23,475
She'll be okay. Right?

890
00:40:23,975 --> 00:40:24,976
Fifty-fifty.

891
00:40:26,228 --> 00:40:27,229
You want one?

892
00:40:28,355 --> 00:40:29,439
But we hate those things.

893
00:40:29,606 --> 00:40:31,399
They taste like cardboard.

894
00:40:32,192 --> 00:40:33,610
We can't say no to Val.

895
00:40:33,776 --> 00:40:35,570
Okay, no, you're so right.

896
00:40:35,737 --> 00:40:37,072
We eat whatever Val eats.

897
00:40:37,239 --> 00:40:38,240
That's the spirit!

898
00:40:38,823 --> 00:40:40,992
Envy, I think you're really in the zone.

899
00:40:41,159 --> 00:40:42,452
Take the wheel, I'll be right back.

900
00:40:42,619 --> 00:40:44,287
She picked me! She picked me.
Did you see that, Ennui?

901
00:40:44,454 --> 00:40:47,207
- She picked me.
- You care too much about things.

902
00:40:49,917 --> 00:40:52,545
It's got a very interesting texture.

903
00:40:52,712 --> 00:40:53,755
It tastes like...

904
00:40:55,215 --> 00:40:56,508
What does it remind me of?

905
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:01,763
Cardboard? Asparagus? Broccoli?

906
00:41:01,929 --> 00:41:03,348
What are they doing to her up there?

907
00:41:03,515 --> 00:41:05,017
I don't know, but we have to go.

908
00:41:05,183 --> 00:41:06,226
No! No way am I step...

909
00:41:06,393 --> 00:41:08,270
We have to. Riley needs us.

910
00:41:09,062 --> 00:41:10,188
Okay, fine!

911
00:41:13,608 --> 00:41:15,902
Gross. I think I'm gonna be sick.

912
00:41:29,166 --> 00:41:31,751
<i>If I'm good at hockey, I'll have friends.</i>

913
00:41:42,012 --> 00:41:43,013
Okay, Miss Riley.

914
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:44,389
- Way to go, Michigan.
- Nice one, Michigan.

915
00:41:44,556 --> 00:41:46,558
All right, ladies. Great day today.

916
00:41:46,724 --> 00:41:48,185
Take it easy tonight.

917
00:41:48,351 --> 00:41:50,812
Yes! This is the moment
we've been waiting for.

918
00:41:50,978 --> 00:41:53,523
<i>Party time with Val and our future besties!</i>

919
00:41:54,691 --> 00:41:56,193
<i>Why are we stopping?
What's going on?</i>

920
00:41:56,359 --> 00:41:57,944
There it is.

921
00:41:58,111 --> 00:41:59,779
The red notebook.

922
00:41:59,946 --> 00:42:02,157
Don't say it like that. You'll freak her out.

923
00:42:02,324 --> 00:42:03,533
Why would it freak me out?

924
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:06,369
Only because everything
Coach thinks about you is in there.

925
00:42:06,536 --> 00:42:08,288
The good and the bad.

926
00:42:08,455 --> 00:42:10,957
- Whether she wants you on the team...
- Or not.

927
00:42:11,124 --> 00:42:12,209
You guys, too much.

928
00:42:12,375 --> 00:42:15,087
- What? It's the truth.
- She's not wrong.

929
00:42:15,253 --> 00:42:16,963
What do you think she's written about us?

930
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:18,840
I don't know. Do you think it's bad?

931
00:42:19,006 --> 00:42:21,093
Well, I didn't until now!

932
00:42:21,259 --> 00:42:23,720
What if she's made a list of all
her favorite players, and we're not on it?

933
00:42:23,886 --> 00:42:26,348
Or a list of all the worst players,
and we're at the top?

934
00:42:26,514 --> 00:42:28,141
Or worse, we're not on either list...

935
00:42:28,308 --> 00:42:30,518
and we fade into obscurity!

936
00:42:30,685 --> 00:42:33,146
Sorry to interrupt you,
but they're walking away.

937
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:35,273
<i>We're losing them, we're losing them.</i>

938
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:41,154
<i>Okay. First big hang with the group.
We just gotta act casual.</i>

939
00:42:41,738 --> 00:42:43,573
<i>Why do our arms swing like that when we walk?</i>

940
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:44,991
<i>Try to keep them still.</i>

941
00:42:45,492 --> 00:42:47,160
<i>- That looks crazy.
- Okay.</i>

942
00:42:47,327 --> 00:42:49,662
Well, walk like Dani.
Her arms have rhythm.

943
00:42:50,497 --> 00:42:51,956
<i>No, you're making it worse!</i>

944
00:42:52,165 --> 00:42:55,085
<i>Well, that wasn't my intention.
I'm sorry for trying something!</i>

945
00:42:55,252 --> 00:42:57,337
<i>What do you think pockets are for?</i>

946
00:42:57,504 --> 00:42:59,714
<i>- That's good.
- Ennui, I am very proud of you.</i>

947
00:43:01,216 --> 00:43:02,259
<i>What are they laughing about?</i>

948
00:43:02,425 --> 00:43:04,094
Does anybody know
what cool people laugh about?

949
00:43:04,261 --> 00:43:05,678
I don't know. We were too focused
on the arms thing.

950
00:43:05,845 --> 00:43:07,430
Just pretend we get the joke.

951
00:43:14,604 --> 00:43:17,315
Joy, Anger is taking up the floret.

952
00:43:17,482 --> 00:43:18,900
Fear, what is the matter with you?

953
00:43:19,067 --> 00:43:20,110
I don't like this vessel.

954
00:43:20,277 --> 00:43:21,278
Well, that's all we have.

955
00:43:21,444 --> 00:43:22,779
How much longer till we get there?

956
00:43:22,945 --> 00:43:24,031
We'll get there when we get there.

957
00:43:24,197 --> 00:43:26,491
I bet Anxiety would know how long,
down to the minute.

958
00:43:26,658 --> 00:43:28,451
Well, she just knows everything, doesn't she?

959
00:43:28,618 --> 00:43:29,661
Look, I don't like her words...

960
00:43:29,827 --> 00:43:30,953
and I do not like her actions.

961
00:43:31,121 --> 00:43:32,372
I just think I can change her.

962
00:43:32,539 --> 00:43:34,874
You know what?
Who likes banana bread?

963
00:43:35,042 --> 00:43:36,209
Show of hands.

964
00:43:39,754 --> 00:43:42,174
So, Michigan, who's your favorite band?

965
00:43:43,883 --> 00:43:44,926
Everyone's staring at us.

966
00:43:45,093 --> 00:43:47,012
There's only one right answer
to this question.

967
00:43:48,263 --> 00:43:50,307
Get Up and Glow! They're so awesome.

968
00:43:50,557 --> 00:43:51,849
Get Up and Glow!

969
00:43:52,017 --> 00:43:54,352
I was all over them in middle school.

970
00:43:54,519 --> 00:43:57,272
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, I was a Glow Girly. Relax.

971
00:43:57,439 --> 00:44:00,983
No! We need a band they think is cool,
not one we actually like.

972
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:03,070
Quick, recall everything we know about music.

973
00:44:19,502 --> 00:44:21,838
We have to know one cool song, right?

974
00:44:24,299 --> 00:44:26,008
<i>- TripleDent gum
- Will make you smile</i>

975
00:44:26,218 --> 00:44:27,469
Embarrassment, get that out of there!

976
00:44:27,635 --> 00:44:28,761
Come on, there's gotta be something in here.

977
00:44:28,928 --> 00:44:30,388
- I'm looking, I'm looking.
- Something better, something cool.

978
00:44:30,555 --> 00:44:33,141
Come on. No, not that. No.

979
00:44:33,641 --> 00:44:34,684
This is the best we have!

980
00:44:34,851 --> 00:44:37,395
It's mostly jingles
and Dad's yacht rock.

981
00:44:37,562 --> 00:44:41,149
But, I mean, you don't still like
Get Up and Glow, do you?

982
00:44:41,566 --> 00:44:43,235
Okay, don't panic. What do we do?

983
00:44:43,401 --> 00:44:46,696
If we don't like their music,
we have nothing to offer these girls.

984
00:44:46,863 --> 00:44:48,405
We'll be outed as the imposter
that we obviously are.

985
00:44:48,406 --> 00:44:49,324
<i>Pardon. Excusez moi.</i>

986
00:44:49,325 --> 00:44:52,410
I've been waiting my whole life
for this very moment.

987
00:44:53,578 --> 00:44:56,789
Yeah. I love Get Up and Glow.

988
00:44:56,956 --> 00:44:59,292
<i>Love Get Up and Glow.</i>

989
00:45:05,632 --> 00:45:07,134
Abandon broccoli!

990
00:45:15,392 --> 00:45:17,519
- Joy!
- Give us your hand! Come on.

991
00:45:19,354 --> 00:45:20,855
What is that?

992
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:22,399
That's a Sar-chasm.

993
00:45:22,565 --> 00:45:23,983
It can open for miles!

994
00:45:24,151 --> 00:45:25,527
Run for your lives!

995
00:45:25,693 --> 00:45:27,820
Sar-chasm? Really?

996
00:45:27,987 --> 00:45:30,573
<i>Get Up and Glow is my favorite band.</i>

997
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:32,409
But she loves Get Up and Glow.

998
00:45:32,575 --> 00:45:34,077
They choreograph their own dances.

999
00:45:34,244 --> 00:45:35,245
Okay, Joy...

1000
00:45:35,412 --> 00:45:37,497
if we can't follow the stream,
we don't know where we're going.

1001
00:45:37,664 --> 00:45:40,458
And if we don't know where we're going,
we can't follow the stream!

1002
00:45:40,625 --> 00:45:44,587
It is an endless loop
of tragedy and consequence!

1003
00:45:44,754 --> 00:45:46,339
Or we could just ask those guys.

1004
00:45:46,506 --> 00:45:47,882
Oh, yeah. Or that.

1005
00:45:48,050 --> 00:45:51,053
Boy, are we so lucky we ran into you guys!

1006
00:45:51,553 --> 00:45:56,558
Boy, are we so lucky we ran into you guys!

1007
00:45:57,809 --> 00:46:00,812
Please, we really need your help!

1008
00:46:00,978 --> 00:46:03,648
We really need your help.

1009
00:46:03,815 --> 00:46:05,025
What's their problem?

1010
00:46:05,358 --> 00:46:07,277
Guys, you just gotta turn on the charm.

1011
00:46:07,735 --> 00:46:08,653
Hey!

1012
00:46:09,029 --> 00:46:12,782
I bet you're the best crane crew
in the world!

1013
00:46:12,949 --> 00:46:14,909
Wow, those guys are jerks.

1014
00:46:16,536 --> 00:46:18,996
Wow, those guys are jerks.

1015
00:46:19,164 --> 00:46:22,875
Yeah. Get Up and Glow is so awesome.

1016
00:46:23,043 --> 00:46:26,254
Riley, what are you talking about?
You love Get Up and Glow.

1017
00:46:27,172 --> 00:46:28,173
Hey, guys.

1018
00:46:29,174 --> 00:46:31,843
Why are our best friends
always trying to hang out with us?

1019
00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:34,554
Come on, Riley,
we just went to their concert.

1020
00:46:34,721 --> 00:46:37,349
- Well, yeah. I mean, sure, but like...
- But what?

1021
00:46:37,515 --> 00:46:38,516
We had a great time.

1022
00:46:38,683 --> 00:46:39,934
Grace, you are not helping.

1023
00:46:41,144 --> 00:46:43,146
Yeah, we had a great time.

1024
00:46:43,646 --> 00:46:45,315
<i>Great time.</i>

1025
00:46:47,275 --> 00:46:48,943
Why can't they just leave her alone?

1026
00:46:49,111 --> 00:46:50,612
What are we gonna do now, Joy?

1027
00:46:50,778 --> 00:46:53,031
We go the long way, which is the best way.

1028
00:46:53,198 --> 00:46:55,533
Stretch those hammies, Anger. Let's go.

1029
00:46:56,284 --> 00:46:58,286
Best night of my life.

1030
00:46:58,453 --> 00:47:00,288
Well, this has been really fun.

1031
00:47:00,455 --> 00:47:01,581
Extremely.

1032
00:47:01,748 --> 00:47:02,790
But we're gonna go now.

1033
00:47:02,957 --> 00:47:04,376
Okay, bye.

1034
00:47:05,001 --> 00:47:06,878
This is the best band ever!

1035
00:47:07,045 --> 00:47:08,963
- Okay, Riley!
- Michigan knows what's up!

1036
00:47:10,632 --> 00:47:13,801
See? As long as we like what they like,
we have all the friends we need.

1037
00:47:14,094 --> 00:47:14,927
Night, guys.

1038
00:47:15,095 --> 00:47:17,055
Well, I think I'm calling it a night.

1039
00:47:17,472 --> 00:47:19,141
- Really?
- Yeah, it's late.

1040
00:47:19,307 --> 00:47:21,434
Plus, I think you'll want to get some sleep
before tomorrow's scrimmage.

1041
00:47:21,601 --> 00:47:22,602
What scrimmage?

1042
00:47:22,769 --> 00:47:25,188
It's just something Coach always does
on the last day.

1043
00:47:25,355 --> 00:47:26,981
It's how Val made the team as a freshman.

1044
00:47:27,149 --> 00:47:28,150
Don't tell her that.

1045
00:47:28,316 --> 00:47:31,528
Val scored two goals.
No freshman has ever done that.

1046
00:47:31,694 --> 00:47:32,529
Dani, stop.

1047
00:47:32,695 --> 00:47:34,864
Technically, it's not your tryout
for the next year...

1048
00:47:35,032 --> 00:47:36,491
but it basically is.

1049
00:47:37,284 --> 00:47:39,202
You'll do great. Just be yourself.

1050
00:47:39,369 --> 00:47:40,412
<i>Did you hear that?</i>

1051
00:47:40,578 --> 00:47:42,622
We could become a Fire Hawk, like, tomorrow.

1052
00:47:42,789 --> 00:47:45,917
But how do we be ourself
if our new self isn't ready yet?

1053
00:47:46,459 --> 00:47:47,377
Excellent point.

1054
00:47:47,544 --> 00:47:49,421
Let's get these memories downstairs.

1055
00:48:00,432 --> 00:48:02,600
Is that broccoli?

1056
00:48:03,185 --> 00:48:05,395
We're getting deeper and deeper in, Joy.

1057
00:48:05,562 --> 00:48:06,563
Great observation.

1058
00:48:06,729 --> 00:48:08,898
The long way did turn out
to be a little longer than I thought.

1059
00:48:09,066 --> 00:48:10,692
Anyway, who wants to sing a song?

1060
00:48:10,858 --> 00:48:12,860
I know a song. It's called, "I give up."

1061
00:48:13,028 --> 00:48:14,654
Or let's play the quiet game!

1062
00:48:14,821 --> 00:48:16,448
One, two, three, hush.

1063
00:48:16,823 --> 00:48:19,492
I'll tell you what we do, we go back
up there and we kick those...

1064
00:48:19,659 --> 00:48:20,993
Anger, now is not the time.

1065
00:48:21,161 --> 00:48:23,996
Joy, this is useless.
Real Riley is out there somewhere...

1066
00:48:24,164 --> 00:48:26,249
- and we're never going to find her.
- You know what? Yeah, these can go.

1067
00:48:26,416 --> 00:48:29,169
No, no, no, I can find her.
I just need to get a better view.

1068
00:48:44,059 --> 00:48:46,144
Okay, well, this isn't working,
and that's fine.

1069
00:48:46,311 --> 00:48:47,687
- Everything's fine.
- This is hopeless.

1070
00:48:47,854 --> 00:48:49,856
I say we cut our losses and walk back.

1071
00:48:50,023 --> 00:48:53,235
This whole trip is just a series
of deader and deader ends.

1072
00:48:53,401 --> 00:48:55,403
Ever since that puberty alarm went off...

1073
00:48:55,570 --> 00:48:58,115
nothing around here works
the way it's supposed to!

1074
00:48:58,281 --> 00:49:00,283
I don't even recognize this place anymore.

1075
00:49:00,450 --> 00:49:02,535
It's light out at 1:00 in the morning!

1076
00:49:02,702 --> 00:49:06,164
I have never been inside so many jars
in my life.

1077
00:49:06,331 --> 00:49:08,083
And the Riley we knew is gone!

1078
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:12,379
And if Joy can't see that, well, then,
she's delusional!

1079
00:49:15,548 --> 00:49:16,841
Delusional?

1080
00:49:17,008 --> 00:49:19,261
Of course I'm delusional!

1081
00:49:19,427 --> 00:49:21,929
Do you know how hard it is
to stay positive all the time...

1082
00:49:22,097 --> 00:49:25,600
when all you folks do
is complain, complain, complain?

1083
00:49:25,767 --> 00:49:27,602
Jiminy mother-loving toaster strudel!

1084
00:49:28,686 --> 00:49:30,438
Do you think I have all the answers?

1085
00:49:30,605 --> 00:49:32,149
Of course I don't!

1086
00:49:34,817 --> 00:49:37,779
We can't even find the back of our own mind.

1087
00:49:41,741 --> 00:49:43,243
Anxiety is right!

1088
00:49:43,868 --> 00:49:47,497
Riley doesn't need us as much
as she needs them.

1089
00:49:49,999 --> 00:49:51,751
And that hurts.

1090
00:49:52,627 --> 00:49:53,878
It really hurts.

1091
00:49:58,925 --> 00:50:00,968
Joy, you've made a lot of mistakes.

1092
00:50:01,136 --> 00:50:02,137
A lot.

1093
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:05,432
And you'll make a whole lot more
in the future.

1094
00:50:06,474 --> 00:50:10,603
But if you let that stop you,
we might as well lie down and give up now.

1095
00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:12,397
Well, actually, that does sound kinda nice.

1096
00:50:14,149 --> 00:50:15,275
Come on.

1097
00:50:22,115 --> 00:50:23,741
- Excuse us.
- Hey! You can't use that.

1098
00:50:23,908 --> 00:50:25,993
- Riley emergency.
- Thank you!

1099
00:50:26,661 --> 00:50:27,662
Hop on!

1100
00:50:42,594 --> 00:50:43,761
Let's just forget that ever happened.

1101
00:50:43,928 --> 00:50:45,222
You don't have to ask me twice.

1102
00:50:49,642 --> 00:50:50,643
Look.

1103
00:50:54,606 --> 00:50:56,316
We're right behind you.

1104
00:51:05,867 --> 00:51:06,868
This is great.

1105
00:51:07,035 --> 00:51:08,495
The Fire Hawks have accepted us.

1106
00:51:08,661 --> 00:51:11,206
But if Coach doesn't put us on the team,
none of that matters.

1107
00:51:11,373 --> 00:51:12,874
Tomorrow is everything.

1108
00:51:13,041 --> 00:51:15,001
Which is why we're gonna need more help.

1109
00:51:15,168 --> 00:51:16,336
Ennui, are you paying attention?

1110
00:51:16,503 --> 00:51:17,337
No.

1111
00:51:17,504 --> 00:51:18,338
Embarrassment?

1112
00:51:18,505 --> 00:51:20,340
<i>- Well, this has been really fun.</i>
- Embarrassment?

1113
00:51:20,507 --> 00:51:21,591
<i>- Extremely.</i>
- Never mind.

1114
00:51:21,758 --> 00:51:24,094
<i>- But we're gonna go.
- Okay, bye.</i>

1115
00:51:35,397 --> 00:51:37,857
Now, let's see. What am I looking for?

1116
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:39,692
Don't you just hate it
when you go to do something...

1117
00:51:39,859 --> 00:51:41,903
and then you get there to do it,
and you forget what you were gonna do?

1118
00:51:42,070 --> 00:51:43,738
We'll need all the help we can get.

1119
00:51:43,905 --> 00:51:45,198
That is exactly what I was thinking.

1120
00:51:57,169 --> 00:51:58,836
Most important game of our lives.

1121
00:52:09,597 --> 00:52:12,225
All right, guys, it's gonna be a long night.

1122
00:52:14,352 --> 00:52:16,063
So let's get the team ready.

1123
00:52:17,730 --> 00:52:19,274
Come on. We just need to cut through...

1124
00:52:20,692 --> 00:52:22,194
Imagination Land!

1125
00:52:22,485 --> 00:52:23,820
You guys are gonna love it.

1126
00:52:23,986 --> 00:52:27,032
There's French Fry forest
and Cloud Town and...

1127
00:52:29,242 --> 00:52:31,119
This place has changed.

1128
00:52:32,370 --> 00:52:34,664
{\an8}Mount Crushmore?

1129
00:52:34,831 --> 00:52:36,208
Those are her top four?

1130
00:52:36,374 --> 00:52:38,626
The only one that matters is Lance.

1131
00:52:38,793 --> 00:52:40,378
Well, at least they got his good side.

1132
00:52:40,545 --> 00:52:42,255
Every side is his good side.

1133
00:52:43,131 --> 00:52:44,674
<i>The Rumor Mill?</i>

1134
00:52:45,092 --> 00:52:46,634
{\an8}Where all of our good gossip comes from.

1135
00:52:47,594 --> 00:52:49,596
Pipin' hot rumors right off the mill!

1136
00:52:49,762 --> 00:52:51,889
"The teacher's lounge has a hot tub"?

1137
00:52:52,057 --> 00:52:54,601
"Lucy from math class is legit psychic"?

1138
00:52:54,767 --> 00:52:58,521
"Abbie R's been texting Mike T,
but Mike T's been obsessing over Sarah M"?

1139
00:52:58,688 --> 00:53:00,232
Where's the journalistic integrity?

1140
00:53:00,398 --> 00:53:02,067
Fort Pillowton's still here!

1141
00:53:02,234 --> 00:53:03,693
And it even got bigger.

1142
00:53:05,570 --> 00:53:07,489
And orange?

1143
00:53:11,368 --> 00:53:14,579
<i>All right, 22, Riley breaks her leg
in practice, disappointing everyone.</i>

1144
00:53:14,746 --> 00:53:15,580
<i>Nice job.</i>

1145
00:53:15,747 --> 00:53:18,541
<i>Now, 18. Val and Dani whispering
after Riley misses a goal.</i>

1146
00:53:18,708 --> 00:53:21,419
<i>Great! We need to help Riley prepare.</i>

1147
00:53:21,586 --> 00:53:24,881
<i>Now's the time to send up every possible
thing that could go wrong.</i>

1148
00:53:25,048 --> 00:53:26,966
<i>We are looking to the future.</i>

1149
00:53:27,259 --> 00:53:29,427
<i>Every possible mistake she could make.</i>

1150
00:53:30,470 --> 00:53:33,848
<i>Come on, 17. I'm not seeing
anything from you.</i>

1151
00:53:37,227 --> 00:53:39,312
<i>Riley misses an open goal,
Coach writes about it in her notebook.</i>

1152
00:53:39,479 --> 00:53:40,313
<i>Yes!</i>

1153
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:41,814
<i>More like that.</i>

1154
00:53:42,232 --> 00:53:43,066
Oh, no!

1155
00:53:43,233 --> 00:53:45,193
They're using Riley's imagination
against her.

1156
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:47,779
<i>Val and her friends like us now,
but if we don't make the team...</i>

1157
00:53:47,945 --> 00:53:49,281
<i>will they like us tomorrow?</i>

1158
00:53:52,575 --> 00:53:54,161
Okay, let's go to number three.

1159
00:53:54,327 --> 00:53:56,829
Bree and Grace's team win,
and we look stupid.

1160
00:53:57,455 --> 00:54:00,375
Number 22. Val passes to us, and we miss it.

1161
00:54:01,834 --> 00:54:03,336
We can't let her do this to Riley.

1162
00:54:03,503 --> 00:54:05,172
We have to shut this down.

1163
00:54:06,589 --> 00:54:10,177
<i>Love it, 37. Riley hits the puck
into her own net.</i>

1164
00:54:11,219 --> 00:54:13,221
- Why are you drawing a hippo?
- I'm not.

1165
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:14,806
I'm drawing Riley!

1166
00:54:14,972 --> 00:54:16,349
Joy, you forgot her ponytail.

1167
00:54:16,516 --> 00:54:17,934
I love her pony tail. Yes!

1168
00:54:18,851 --> 00:54:20,687
Riley scores and everyone hugs her?

1169
00:54:20,853 --> 00:54:22,397
81, that is not helping.

1170
00:54:22,564 --> 00:54:24,274
Riley paints her nails to match her jersey.

1171
00:54:24,441 --> 00:54:26,901
Everybody copies her. And she is so cool.

1172
00:54:27,069 --> 00:54:29,154
Riley wears knee pads.

1173
00:54:29,321 --> 00:54:31,823
We buy flowers for the losing team!

1174
00:54:32,532 --> 00:54:35,077
What? I can't always be the rage guy.

1175
00:54:35,243 --> 00:54:36,619
No, no. I liked it.

1176
00:54:36,786 --> 00:54:38,121
Nail polish? Knee pads?

1177
00:54:38,288 --> 00:54:41,041
I'm starting to think you guys
don't understand the assignment.

1178
00:54:41,583 --> 00:54:42,417
What...

1179
00:54:46,003 --> 00:54:48,673
What? Who sent that projection to Riley?

1180
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:50,342
- Why would I know that?
- Don't look at me.

1181
00:54:53,178 --> 00:54:54,346
What is going on?

1182
00:54:54,512 --> 00:54:56,473
Who is sending all this positive...

1183
00:54:58,141 --> 00:54:59,476
<i>Joy.</i>

1184
00:54:59,642 --> 00:55:01,436
<i>I know you're in there.</i>

1185
00:55:01,603 --> 00:55:03,021
- Is that really her?
- Is she really here?

1186
00:55:03,188 --> 00:55:04,522
Joy from Headquarters?

1187
00:55:04,689 --> 00:55:06,149
The mind police are on their way.

1188
00:55:07,692 --> 00:55:08,860
Well, I think we gave it our best shot.

1189
00:55:09,027 --> 00:55:10,862
Don't listen to Anxiety.

1190
00:55:11,029 --> 00:55:14,366
She's using these horrible projections
to change Riley.

1191
00:55:14,532 --> 00:55:16,368
<i>Joy, I'm doing this for you!</i>

1192
00:55:16,534 --> 00:55:18,536
This is all so Riley can be happier.

1193
00:55:18,703 --> 00:55:22,624
If you wanted her to be happy,
then you'd stop hurting her.

1194
00:55:22,999 --> 00:55:24,000
Who's with me?

1195
00:55:27,170 --> 00:55:28,921
Really? Nothing?

1196
00:55:29,089 --> 00:55:30,507
<i>Sorry, Joy.</i>

1197
00:55:31,508 --> 00:55:33,551
Yeah! I see you, 87.

1198
00:55:33,718 --> 00:55:34,594
A cat.

1199
00:55:34,761 --> 00:55:36,679
A little off-topic, but I'll take it.

1200
00:55:36,846 --> 00:55:38,390
Who else? Come on!

1201
00:55:38,556 --> 00:55:40,975
<i>What if Riley is better than Val
and then Val hates her?</i>

1202
00:55:41,143 --> 00:55:44,271
Or what if Riley is better than Val
and Val respects her?

1203
00:55:45,147 --> 00:55:46,564
Yeah! There we go!

1204
00:55:47,482 --> 00:55:51,319
What if Riley is so bad
she has to give up hockey forever?

1205
00:55:51,486 --> 00:55:54,156
What if Riley does so well
that the coach cries...

1206
00:55:54,322 --> 00:55:55,573
and the Olympics call...

1207
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:58,785
and she rallies a weary nation to victory?

1208
00:55:58,951 --> 00:56:00,870
Joy, reality is also a thing.

1209
00:56:02,664 --> 00:56:03,581
No!

1210
00:56:03,998 --> 00:56:08,336
Anxiety has got you all chained to desks,
drawing nightmares!

1211
00:56:08,503 --> 00:56:11,005
But you don't have to take it anymore!

1212
00:56:11,173 --> 00:56:13,341
Pencils down! Projections off!

1213
00:56:13,508 --> 00:56:14,342
Yeah!

1214
00:56:14,509 --> 00:56:15,843
Enough is enough!

1215
00:56:18,930 --> 00:56:19,972
My projections!

1216
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:21,516
Pillow fight!

1217
00:56:24,686 --> 00:56:26,063
For Riley!

1218
00:56:26,229 --> 00:56:28,106
<i>We need to be prepared.</i>

1219
00:56:31,859 --> 00:56:32,860
No!

1220
00:56:35,613 --> 00:56:37,574
Okay, it's time to go!

1221
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:38,825
Yeah, I think so.

1222
00:56:38,991 --> 00:56:41,078
- Bring it on, coppers!
- Oh, no, no, no.

1223
00:56:45,207 --> 00:56:46,208
Hey, get back here!

1224
00:56:46,374 --> 00:56:48,460
Quick! To the Parade of Future Careers!

1225
00:56:51,754 --> 00:56:52,755
{\an8}Grab a balloon!

1226
00:56:53,090 --> 00:56:54,257
- A pastry chef!
- Underpaid!

1227
00:56:54,424 --> 00:56:55,717
- Art teacher!
- Underappreciated.

1228
00:56:56,551 --> 00:56:59,429
- Ethnomusicologist!
- I don't understand what that is.

1229
00:56:59,596 --> 00:57:00,555
Supreme Court justice!

1230
00:57:00,722 --> 00:57:01,598
- That's the one!
- I trust her judgment.

1231
00:57:01,764 --> 00:57:02,599
Get back here!

1232
00:57:04,142 --> 00:57:05,435
They're getting away!

1233
00:57:08,021 --> 00:57:10,815
Yes! Now Riley can get some sleep.

1234
00:57:11,441 --> 00:57:13,401
I miss the jar!

1235
00:57:13,568 --> 00:57:14,986
Joy doesn't get it.

1236
00:57:15,153 --> 00:57:17,364
Without our projections,
we won't be prepared.

1237
00:57:17,530 --> 00:57:19,074
Tomorrow's game is everything.

1238
00:57:19,241 --> 00:57:23,953
Coach will either make us a Fire Hawk
or doom us to a friendless future.

1239
00:57:24,121 --> 00:57:26,414
I wish we knew what Coach thought about us.

1240
00:57:27,707 --> 00:57:30,210
- Her notebook!
- Yes! That's a great idea!

1241
00:57:30,877 --> 00:57:32,754
<i>Everything Coach thinks about you
is in there.</i>

1242
00:57:34,089 --> 00:57:36,716
All we got to do is sneak into her office
and read it.

1243
00:57:41,013 --> 00:57:42,430
<i>Come on, Riley. Move those feet.</i>

1244
00:57:43,181 --> 00:57:44,224
She doesn't want to?

1245
00:57:44,849 --> 00:57:46,309
Are we pushing her too hard?

1246
00:57:46,476 --> 00:57:48,228
We got to see what's in the notebook!

1247
00:57:48,395 --> 00:57:50,272
It's the only way for us
to know how we can do better.

1248
00:57:59,197 --> 00:58:00,948
Riley, no.

1249
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:05,745
Joy? Come in, Joy.

1250
00:58:05,912 --> 00:58:07,872
<i>Sadness? Sadness, what's wrong?</i>

1251
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:09,666
Why is Riley awake again? Over.

1252
00:58:10,458 --> 00:58:13,336
Anxiety is making Riley
break into the coach's office.

1253
00:58:13,503 --> 00:58:15,255
- What?
- She knows better than that.

1254
00:58:15,422 --> 00:58:17,840
She will once we get her Sense of Self back.

1255
00:58:18,007 --> 00:58:20,093
Sadness, you have to stop her.

1256
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:22,095
<i>Just don't get caught.</i>

1257
00:58:22,970 --> 00:58:23,805
<i>Over!</i>

1258
00:59:13,896 --> 00:59:15,898
No, Riley, no.

1259
00:59:34,584 --> 00:59:35,585
Why did she stop?

1260
00:59:36,211 --> 00:59:37,337
Sadness?

1261
00:59:37,754 --> 00:59:39,172
Ennui! Where's your phone?

1262
00:59:39,797 --> 00:59:41,341
My phone? Where is my phone?

1263
00:59:41,508 --> 00:59:43,343
Seriously? This is not happening!

1264
00:59:43,635 --> 00:59:44,802
No, no, no!

1265
00:59:44,969 --> 00:59:47,347
Okay, she's got to be here somewhere.
Find her.

1266
00:59:48,181 --> 00:59:49,182
Gotcha!

1267
01:00:05,782 --> 01:00:06,991
Sadness.

1268
01:00:07,784 --> 01:00:08,785
No.

1269
01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:13,165
I know Riley sneaking around feels wrong.

1270
01:00:13,331 --> 01:00:15,333
This isn't who Riley is.

1271
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:17,919
It's not about who Riley is.

1272
01:00:18,086 --> 01:00:20,422
It's about who she needs to be.

1273
01:00:35,103 --> 01:00:36,729
"Not ready yet"?

1274
01:00:36,896 --> 01:00:39,482
Wait. Coach already decided?

1275
01:00:39,649 --> 01:00:40,858
We're not making the team?

1276
01:00:41,026 --> 01:00:43,111
No. We have one day left.

1277
01:00:43,278 --> 01:00:44,612
What do we do? What can we do?

1278
01:00:44,779 --> 01:00:46,114
- Okay, okay, okay.
- What would Val do?

1279
01:00:46,406 --> 01:00:49,284
Well, we're just gonna
have to change Coach's mind.

1280
01:00:49,451 --> 01:00:50,993
Which means we're gonna need ideas.

1281
01:00:51,161 --> 01:00:52,204
Lots of them.

1282
01:00:59,336 --> 01:01:02,172
Oh, no. It's a Brainstorm!

1283
01:01:03,256 --> 01:01:04,257
Too close!

1284
01:01:05,342 --> 01:01:06,801
Hog the puck?

1285
01:01:06,968 --> 01:01:08,970
Trash talk the other team?

1286
01:01:12,432 --> 01:01:13,391
Yes!

1287
01:01:15,643 --> 01:01:17,895
We can't let these bad ideas get to Riley.

1288
01:01:19,022 --> 01:01:19,856
Joy!

1289
01:01:21,774 --> 01:01:23,985
- Smash as many as you can!
- Joy!

1290
01:01:25,778 --> 01:01:26,821
Joy!

1291
01:01:32,660 --> 01:01:35,122
I'll start sorting these into ideas
I wish I'd thought of.

1292
01:01:35,288 --> 01:01:37,290
Oh, no, no, no.
None of these are good enough.

1293
01:01:37,457 --> 01:01:38,291
We need more.

1294
01:01:38,458 --> 01:01:39,292
Get more!

1295
01:01:41,461 --> 01:01:42,920
Get on the balloon!

1296
01:01:47,550 --> 01:01:49,594
This is worse than the broccoli!

1297
01:01:53,390 --> 01:01:55,017
Quick! Grab an idea.

1298
01:01:57,727 --> 01:01:59,479
These ideas are too small.

1299
01:01:59,646 --> 01:02:01,023
These ideas are too small!

1300
01:02:01,189 --> 01:02:02,732
We need something bigger.

1301
01:02:06,944 --> 01:02:08,280
That's our way out!

1302
01:02:13,868 --> 01:02:14,869
Ready?

1303
01:02:22,085 --> 01:02:24,087
Joy! We need this idea!

1304
01:02:24,421 --> 01:02:27,006
If Riley takes one of these ideas,
it could be a disaster!

1305
01:02:27,174 --> 01:02:29,259
Joy, the only way out is up.

1306
01:02:44,274 --> 01:02:45,817
That's a big idea!

1307
01:02:46,901 --> 01:02:47,944
I like it.

1308
01:02:49,321 --> 01:02:50,322
Oh, no.

1309
01:02:54,409 --> 01:02:55,952
Hold me!

1310
01:02:56,369 --> 01:02:57,954
Seriously. Hold me!

1311
01:02:59,956 --> 01:03:02,625
Fear, you have a parachute?

1312
01:03:02,917 --> 01:03:03,751
Yes.

1313
01:03:03,918 --> 01:03:05,712
The real question is, why don't any of you?

1314
01:03:07,089 --> 01:03:09,549
- Land! Yes! Stuck the landing!
- Yes!

1315
01:03:09,716 --> 01:03:10,758
We did it!

1316
01:03:10,925 --> 01:03:11,926
We made it!

1317
01:03:12,094 --> 01:03:14,096
Come on, to the Back of the Mind!

1318
01:03:14,262 --> 01:03:16,264
You're finished, Anxiety!

1319
01:03:19,142 --> 01:03:20,935
Coach is right.
Riley isn't ready.

1320
01:03:21,103 --> 01:03:24,522
But we're so close
to a new Riley who is.

1321
01:03:24,689 --> 01:03:25,982
This is what we're missing.

1322
01:03:26,524 --> 01:03:30,653
We show them we're a Fire Hawk
who will do whatever it takes.

1323
01:03:52,384 --> 01:03:54,802
Finally, we're one of them!

1324
01:03:54,969 --> 01:03:56,263
What do you think, Sadness?

1325
01:03:56,429 --> 01:03:57,597
- Well, I...
- Awesome!

1326
01:03:57,930 --> 01:03:59,141
<i>Red is really our color.</i>

1327
01:03:59,307 --> 01:04:01,726
Yeah, no, I mean, it's so much fun.

1328
01:04:07,815 --> 01:04:10,568
Okay, it's giving jealousy.
I'm sorry.

1329
01:04:10,735 --> 01:04:13,113
They wouldn't know cool
if it hit them in the face.

1330
01:04:13,405 --> 01:04:14,697
Hey, Michigan.

1331
01:04:15,782 --> 01:04:17,284
Rocking the red, huh?

1332
01:04:17,450 --> 01:04:19,536
- Yes!
- We are in.

1333
01:04:20,037 --> 01:04:21,038
I hope it's okay.

1334
01:04:21,204 --> 01:04:22,664
I know I'm not officially a Fire Hawk yet...

1335
01:04:22,830 --> 01:04:24,166
but I figured since we're
on the same team...

1336
01:04:24,332 --> 01:04:25,375
we should match, right?

1337
01:04:25,542 --> 01:04:26,584
Yeah, yeah, that's fine.

1338
01:04:26,751 --> 01:04:28,211
Did you sleep last night?

1339
01:04:28,378 --> 01:04:30,505
No, how could I? Big game today!

1340
01:04:30,672 --> 01:04:32,090
You mean the camp scrimmage?

1341
01:04:32,257 --> 01:04:34,592
See? I told you not to freak her out.

1342
01:04:34,759 --> 01:04:36,886
You're all good, okay?
I see you're in your zone.

1343
01:04:37,054 --> 01:04:38,846
Get ready to score some goals.

1344
01:04:39,014 --> 01:04:40,348
Yeah! I will!

1345
01:04:40,557 --> 01:04:43,185
Val scored two goals in the scrimmage
to become a Fire Hawk.

1346
01:04:43,351 --> 01:04:44,936
And you know what's better than two?

1347
01:04:45,103 --> 01:04:46,021
- Three!
- Three!

1348
01:04:46,188 --> 01:04:48,898
I was just about to say that.
We were about to say that at the same time.

1349
01:04:49,066 --> 01:04:52,027
But how are we gonna score three goals?

1350
01:04:52,194 --> 01:04:54,154
The new Riley will handle anything.

1351
01:04:54,321 --> 01:04:56,989
And I think this is the finishing touch.

1352
01:05:00,243 --> 01:05:01,328
I'll be right back.

1353
01:05:06,583 --> 01:05:07,584
Come on!

1354
01:05:07,875 --> 01:05:08,960
We're so close.

1355
01:05:09,127 --> 01:05:11,088
The Sense of Self is just on top of that...

1356
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:17,219
That is a lot.

1357
01:05:17,385 --> 01:05:19,512
This is more than I remember
sending back here.

1358
01:05:20,347 --> 01:05:22,807
When she walked into
that glass door at that party.

1359
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:25,518
Yeah, and breaking Grandma's favorite plate.

1360
01:05:25,685 --> 01:05:27,729
Thank goodness these aren't part of her.

1361
01:05:27,895 --> 01:05:29,272
Yeah.

1362
01:05:43,245 --> 01:05:44,246
There it is.

1363
01:05:50,418 --> 01:05:53,255
<i>I'm a good person.</i>

1364
01:05:53,588 --> 01:05:54,589
Oh, no.

1365
01:06:04,724 --> 01:06:06,393
Yes. Come on, come on.

1366
01:06:06,976 --> 01:06:08,603
Here we go!

1367
01:06:10,605 --> 01:06:11,689
<i>I'm not good enough.</i>

1368
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:14,234
What?

1369
01:06:14,401 --> 01:06:16,611
<i>I'm not good enough.</i>

1370
01:06:18,238 --> 01:06:19,947
<i>I'm not good enough.</i>

1371
01:06:22,409 --> 01:06:23,410
Are you sure?

1372
01:06:23,576 --> 01:06:24,411
Don't worry.

1373
01:06:24,577 --> 01:06:26,579
It's just that she knows that there's
always room for self-improvement.

1374
01:06:26,746 --> 01:06:27,747
She'll be fine.

1375
01:06:30,333 --> 01:06:31,793
Sadness, we have the Sense of Self.

1376
01:06:31,959 --> 01:06:32,960
<i>Bring us back!</i>

1377
01:06:33,253 --> 01:06:34,379
<i>Sadness, do you copy?</i>

1378
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:40,093
<i>I'm not good enough.</i>

1379
01:06:49,227 --> 01:06:50,603
Okay, I can work with this.

1380
01:06:50,770 --> 01:06:53,065
I just need to recalibrate the console
and make sure it's ready.

1381
01:06:53,231 --> 01:06:54,732
Just no more surprises.

1382
01:06:55,733 --> 01:06:57,277
Okay, this one goes here.
Check.

1383
01:06:57,444 --> 01:06:58,570
That one goes there.
Check.

1384
01:06:58,736 --> 01:07:00,113
Not exactly there.
Here.

1385
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:03,325
Come on. Turn it up a little bit.
It's got to be absolutely perfect.

1386
01:07:03,491 --> 01:07:05,493
That one is definitely wrong.
What is happening?

1387
01:07:05,660 --> 01:07:06,911
<i>Sadness, now!</i>

1388
01:07:18,506 --> 01:07:19,341
Joy...

1389
01:07:19,507 --> 01:07:21,218
Oh, no!

1390
01:07:39,361 --> 01:07:42,280
<i>I'm a good person.</i>

1391
01:07:42,739 --> 01:07:44,741
<i>I'm not good enough.</i>

1392
01:07:48,578 --> 01:07:50,205
That was our only way back.

1393
01:07:50,372 --> 01:07:52,165
- What do we do?
- We were so close.

1394
01:08:01,258 --> 01:08:02,342
Joy. Joy!

1395
01:08:03,343 --> 01:08:04,386
Where are you going?

1396
01:08:21,278 --> 01:08:23,363
<i>Twenty-eight! Andersen, tripping!</i>

1397
01:08:26,491 --> 01:08:28,618
<i>Twenty-eight! Andersen, tripping!</i>

1398
01:08:34,874 --> 01:08:36,958
<i>Twenty-eight! Andersen, tripping!</i>

1399
01:08:39,211 --> 01:08:41,131
<i>I expected better, Riley.</i>

1400
01:08:44,634 --> 01:08:45,842
That's not...

1401
01:08:51,848 --> 01:08:52,684
What...

1402
01:08:59,899 --> 01:09:01,818
Come on, please.

1403
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:04,779
What am I missing?

1404
01:09:10,242 --> 01:09:13,163
<i>I'm a good person.</i>

1405
01:09:20,670 --> 01:09:21,796
Joy...

1406
01:09:22,629 --> 01:09:24,841
so what do we do now?

1407
01:09:33,475 --> 01:09:34,934
I don't know.

1408
01:09:36,811 --> 01:09:38,980
I don't know how to stop Anxiety.

1409
01:09:41,773 --> 01:09:43,235
Maybe we can't.

1410
01:09:45,277 --> 01:09:48,030
Maybe this is what happens
when you grow up.

1411
01:09:49,241 --> 01:09:51,493
You feel less joy.

1412
01:09:58,415 --> 01:09:59,792
But I do know this.

1413
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:07,217
Riley will never be herself if we don't
get this back to Headquarters.

1414
01:10:07,675 --> 01:10:08,885
Fast.

1415
01:10:10,137 --> 01:10:11,429
How?

1416
01:10:15,350 --> 01:10:16,809
Have a good game, Riley.

1417
01:10:17,310 --> 01:10:18,311
You too.

1418
01:10:20,855 --> 01:10:22,107
<i>I'm not good enough.</i>

1419
01:10:29,072 --> 01:10:30,740
Yes! Go, go, go!

1420
01:10:31,658 --> 01:10:34,119
Riley, I'm open. Pass it, pass it!

1421
01:10:34,286 --> 01:10:35,578
<i>I'm not good enough.</i>

1422
01:10:41,543 --> 01:10:42,585
Yeah, Michigan!

1423
01:10:42,752 --> 01:10:44,587
Leave some for the rest of us, huh?

1424
01:10:44,754 --> 01:10:46,714
Yes! One down, two to go.

1425
01:10:47,299 --> 01:10:50,760
Okay, so how do we get our Sense of Self
from here to there?

1426
01:10:52,887 --> 01:10:56,433
I have an idea, but I really don't like it.

1427
01:10:56,599 --> 01:10:58,476
Anger, Riley needs us.

1428
01:11:00,645 --> 01:11:03,315
Oh, Pouchy!

1429
01:11:05,275 --> 01:11:08,611
Well, what are you waiting for?
Say the words!

1430
01:11:08,778 --> 01:11:10,822
Oh, Pouchy!

1431
01:11:17,412 --> 01:11:19,539
Hi, everybody. I'm Pouchy!

1432
01:11:19,706 --> 01:11:20,540
We know.

1433
01:11:20,707 --> 01:11:22,250
Pouchy, we need to get back to Headquarters.

1434
01:11:22,417 --> 01:11:24,001
Do you have anything that can help us?

1435
01:11:24,169 --> 01:11:25,795
I have lots of items.

1436
01:11:25,962 --> 01:11:28,173
Which one do you think will work the best?

1437
01:11:28,340 --> 01:11:29,507
A roll of tape...

1438
01:11:29,674 --> 01:11:31,759
- a rubber ducky...
- No time!

1439
01:11:34,554 --> 01:11:36,514
Seriously, Pouchy? Dynamite?

1440
01:11:36,681 --> 01:11:40,060
Don't you have, like, a jetpack or a plane
or something that's going to help us?

1441
01:11:40,227 --> 01:11:41,936
What do you think, I have everything in here?

1442
01:11:42,104 --> 01:11:44,647
I offered you the rubber ducky,
I offered you the tape.

1443
01:11:44,814 --> 01:11:45,732
I know what to do.

1444
01:11:45,898 --> 01:11:47,900
But we're gonna need a lot more dynamite.

1445
01:11:49,027 --> 01:11:50,695
You know what? Good luck...

1446
01:11:54,449 --> 01:11:55,908
<i>Come on, Riley. Get the puck!</i>

1447
01:11:56,451 --> 01:11:57,619
Take it, take it!

1448
01:11:59,412 --> 01:12:01,039
<i>I'm not good enough.</i>

1449
01:12:02,290 --> 01:12:03,916
Michigan, what are you doing?

1450
01:12:04,709 --> 01:12:06,211
We're on the same team!

1451
01:12:12,967 --> 01:12:13,968
Yes!

1452
01:12:14,761 --> 01:12:16,971
Well, Dani might be a little mad at us...

1453
01:12:17,139 --> 01:12:18,973
but they'll all forgive us
when we make the team.

1454
01:12:19,141 --> 01:12:21,559
Come on, Riley. One more goal.

1455
01:12:26,731 --> 01:12:27,774
Hold on, Joy.

1456
01:12:27,940 --> 01:12:29,651
- We're gonna blow up this cliff?
- Yep!

1457
01:12:29,817 --> 01:12:33,405
And then we'll ride an avalanche
of bad memories back to Headquarters?

1458
01:12:33,571 --> 01:12:34,406
Yeah!

1459
01:12:34,572 --> 01:12:37,534
And how do we keep the bad memories
from forming bad beliefs?

1460
01:12:37,909 --> 01:12:39,119
I don't know.

1461
01:12:40,412 --> 01:12:42,914
Yeah! What could go wrong?
I'm in!

1462
01:12:43,081 --> 01:12:43,998
Ready?

1463
01:12:44,166 --> 01:12:45,167
- For Riley.
- Let's do it.

1464
01:12:45,333 --> 01:12:47,210
Here we come, Riley.

1465
01:13:01,099 --> 01:13:02,059
Jump on!

1466
01:13:27,167 --> 01:13:28,168
Come on!

1467
01:13:29,544 --> 01:13:30,378
Man!

1468
01:13:32,089 --> 01:13:33,548
<i>I'm not good enough.</i>

1469
01:13:33,715 --> 01:13:35,467
<i>You have to score!</i>

1470
01:13:44,892 --> 01:13:47,812
Andersen, penalty box, two minutes.

1471
01:13:47,979 --> 01:13:48,855
No!

1472
01:13:49,606 --> 01:13:51,233
Grace, are you okay?

1473
01:13:55,237 --> 01:13:56,279
We hurt Grace.

1474
01:13:56,446 --> 01:13:59,157
It all happened so fast.
I didn't even see her.

1475
01:14:05,788 --> 01:14:07,165
<i>I'm not good enough.</i>

1476
01:14:07,332 --> 01:14:08,916
Oh, no. What did I do?

1477
01:14:11,211 --> 01:14:12,170
No, no.

1478
01:14:13,338 --> 01:14:14,506
I can fix it, I can fix it.

1479
01:14:54,046 --> 01:14:55,880
<i>I expected better, Riley.</i>

1480
01:14:56,798 --> 01:14:58,007
Wait... No!

1481
01:14:59,509 --> 01:15:00,510
Come on.

1482
01:15:01,803 --> 01:15:03,221
<i>I'm not good enough.</i>

1483
01:15:03,930 --> 01:15:04,931
Come on, Riley.

1484
01:15:05,348 --> 01:15:06,391
Get it together.

1485
01:15:06,558 --> 01:15:07,975
Come on, Riley, get it together.

1486
01:15:08,518 --> 01:15:09,686
<i>I'm not good enough.</i>

1487
01:15:10,895 --> 01:15:12,897
You have to score, Riley!

1488
01:15:13,065 --> 01:15:15,067
Or this will all have been for nothing!

1489
01:15:15,233 --> 01:15:17,277
Anxiety, you're putting too much pressure
on her.

1490
01:15:35,420 --> 01:15:37,547
Okay, let's take a breather!

1491
01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:50,810
- Sadness!
- Joy! Help!

1492
01:15:52,437 --> 01:15:54,231
Come on! We can do this!

1493
01:15:55,190 --> 01:15:56,566
It's not working!

1494
01:15:56,733 --> 01:15:57,817
It's Anxiety.

1495
01:16:15,127 --> 01:16:16,711
Anxiety, stop!

1496
01:16:23,176 --> 01:16:25,720
You don't get to choose who Riley is.

1497
01:16:31,934 --> 01:16:32,935
Anxiety...

1498
01:16:38,275 --> 01:16:39,859
you need to let her go.

1499
01:17:03,925 --> 01:17:05,927
<i>I'm a good person.</i>

1500
01:17:17,064 --> 01:17:18,065
Joy.

1501
01:17:18,856 --> 01:17:20,150
I'm sorry.

1502
01:17:21,526 --> 01:17:24,279
I was just trying to protect her.

1503
01:17:26,031 --> 01:17:27,282
But you're right.

1504
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:31,786
We don't get to choose who Riley is.

1505
01:17:36,708 --> 01:17:40,378
We keep the best and toss the rest.

1506
01:17:52,765 --> 01:17:54,892
<i>Twenty-eight. Andersen, tripping.</i>

1507
01:18:18,583 --> 01:18:20,252
<i>I'm a good person.</i>

1508
01:18:27,717 --> 01:18:29,177
Joy! What are you doing?

1509
01:18:40,647 --> 01:18:41,939
<i>I'm selfish.</i>

1510
01:18:43,108 --> 01:18:44,317
<i>I'm kind.</i>

1511
01:18:45,818 --> 01:18:47,570
<i>I'm not good enough.</i>

1512
01:18:48,613 --> 01:18:50,198
<i>I'm a good person.</i>

1513
01:18:50,740 --> 01:18:52,367
<i>I need to fit in...</i>

1514
01:18:52,867 --> 01:18:54,744
<i>but I want to be myself.</i>

1515
01:18:55,162 --> 01:18:57,205
<i>I'm brave, but I get scared.</i>

1516
01:18:57,372 --> 01:18:59,166
<i>Success is everything.
I make mistakes.</i>

1517
01:18:59,332 --> 01:19:00,500
<i>I'm nice.
I'm mean.</i>

1518
01:19:00,667 --> 01:19:01,501
<i>I'm a good friend.</i>

1519
01:19:01,668 --> 01:19:02,585
<i>I'm a terrible friend.
I am strong.</i>

1520
01:19:02,752 --> 01:19:04,421
<i>I'm weak.
I need help sometimes.</i>

1521
01:20:03,605 --> 01:20:06,024
Riley, you okay?

1522
01:20:14,449 --> 01:20:15,325
Yeah.

1523
01:20:15,867 --> 01:20:18,286
I mean no.

1524
01:20:21,914 --> 01:20:24,251
I was such a jerk to you guys.

1525
01:20:25,585 --> 01:20:29,631
When you guys told me you were going
to a different school, I freaked out.

1526
01:20:29,797 --> 01:20:30,840
And...

1527
01:20:33,676 --> 01:20:34,969
I'm so sorry.

1528
01:20:37,597 --> 01:20:39,516
If you don't want to be friends anymore...

1529
01:20:40,850 --> 01:20:41,851
I get it.

1530
01:20:42,852 --> 01:20:43,978
But...

1531
01:20:44,146 --> 01:20:46,231
I really hope that you can forgive me.

1532
01:20:47,649 --> 01:20:48,733
Someday.

1533
01:21:16,303 --> 01:21:17,637
- Let's go, ladies!
- Come on.

1534
01:21:17,804 --> 01:21:19,389
We've got a game to finish.

1535
01:21:48,376 --> 01:21:49,377
Joy...

1536
01:21:49,794 --> 01:21:51,838
Riley wants you.

1537
01:22:27,124 --> 01:22:28,125
Riley!

1538
01:23:12,419 --> 01:23:13,461
Yes!

1539
01:23:35,692 --> 01:23:37,944
Hey, Minnesota, how long are you gonna stare
at your phone?

1540
01:23:38,111 --> 01:23:41,198
It's almost 2:00.
Coach is gonna post the list any minute.

1541
01:23:41,364 --> 01:23:43,700
- Okay. 2:00 p.m. That's in...
- Six minutes.

1542
01:23:43,866 --> 01:23:45,160
And what happens
if we don't become a Fire Hawk?

1543
01:23:45,327 --> 01:23:47,787
Well, thanks for asking, Joy. I'll tell you.

1544
01:23:48,288 --> 01:23:49,956
First, Mom and Dad
are very disappointed.

1545
01:23:50,123 --> 01:23:52,209
We don't go pro, and we find work
as an ethnomusicologist...

1546
01:23:52,375 --> 01:23:53,501
even though we don't really know
what that is.

1547
01:23:53,668 --> 01:23:55,837
We have no friends, and we die alone.

1548
01:23:56,171 --> 01:23:57,214
Okay, okay.

1549
01:23:57,380 --> 01:23:59,216
None of that is happening right now.

1550
01:23:59,382 --> 01:24:00,383
- Is it?
- No.

1551
01:24:00,550 --> 01:24:03,470
Great! So why don't we take a seat
in our special chair.

1552
01:24:03,636 --> 01:24:05,680
Yeah, that's a great idea.

1553
01:24:06,181 --> 01:24:07,599
See? Isn't that better?

1554
01:24:07,765 --> 01:24:09,976
Yeah, that's the stuff.

1555
01:24:10,268 --> 01:24:12,312
We can't control whether Riley
makes the team.

1556
01:24:12,479 --> 01:24:13,938
But what can we control?

1557
01:24:14,106 --> 01:24:15,148
Well...

1558
01:24:15,523 --> 01:24:17,734
Riley has a Spanish test tomorrow.
We need to study.

1559
01:24:17,900 --> 01:24:20,069
- You're right. We totally...
<i>- Olvidamos!</i>

1560
01:24:20,070 --> 01:24:21,446
- What's that mean?
- "Forgot."

1561
01:24:21,779 --> 01:24:23,406
- Someone paid attention in class.
- I never would've thought of that.

1562
01:24:23,573 --> 01:24:24,781
- You're clearly an expert.
<i>- Muchas gracias.</i>

1563
01:24:24,782 --> 01:24:25,991
Thanks, guys.

1564
01:24:25,992 --> 01:24:29,412
Plus, we followed our new
varsity caliber training program.

1565
01:24:29,704 --> 01:24:30,788
I wish I thought of that.

1566
01:24:30,955 --> 01:24:32,415
Newsflash, you did!

1567
01:24:32,582 --> 01:24:34,000
Wait, you're right, I did.

1568
01:24:34,501 --> 01:24:36,711
I'm jealous of myself.
Thanks for the reminder.

1569
01:24:36,878 --> 01:24:38,046
You're welcome!

1570
01:24:38,213 --> 01:24:40,465
- Who said that?
- It's my new buddy, Pouchy.

1571
01:24:40,632 --> 01:24:42,509
Hi, everybody. I'm Pouchy!

1572
01:24:42,675 --> 01:24:44,261
Confetti if we make the team!

1573
01:24:44,427 --> 01:24:45,553
Good idea.

1574
01:24:46,179 --> 01:24:48,473
That's great, but either way,
we love our girl.

1575
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:49,974
Confetti if we don't!

1576
01:24:53,061 --> 01:24:56,148
- Is it Coach's email?
- No. It's Bree and Grace.

1577
01:24:57,607 --> 01:24:59,317
I miss those girls.

1578
01:25:00,235 --> 01:25:02,112
Remember when Bree and Grace...

1579
01:25:02,279 --> 01:25:03,530
- and us used to...
- You're still early.

1580
01:25:03,696 --> 01:25:05,073
- No, no, no. Too early.
- Go downstairs.

1581
01:25:05,240 --> 01:25:07,742
I'll just be downstairs if you need me.

1582
01:25:07,909 --> 01:25:09,369
<i>It's 3 minutes to 2:00.</i>

1583
01:25:09,536 --> 01:25:11,996
- She's got this.
- 'Cause she's got us.

1584
01:25:12,830 --> 01:25:17,502
Yeah! Right? 'Cause she's... Maybe?

1585
01:25:17,669 --> 01:25:19,171
All right, Embarrassment.

1586
01:25:19,337 --> 01:25:21,173
Everybody, look at Embarrassment!

1587
01:25:23,550 --> 01:25:26,678
Hey, look, if you don't make it this year,
there's always next year.

1588
01:25:27,012 --> 01:25:27,929
I know.

1589
01:25:28,346 --> 01:25:30,765
- I love our girl.
- How could you not?

1590
01:25:30,932 --> 01:25:32,267
<i>She's super smart.</i>

1591
01:25:32,434 --> 01:25:33,810
<i>And great at hockey.</i>

1592
01:25:33,976 --> 01:25:35,270
<i>She's really creative.</i>

1593
01:25:35,437 --> 01:25:37,730
She can be bored, but never boring.

1594
01:25:37,897 --> 01:25:40,525
But she can be a little sarcastic
from time to time.

1595
01:25:40,692 --> 01:25:43,695
<i>She can have really bad ideas.</i>

1596
01:25:43,861 --> 01:25:46,573
<i>Occasionally, she can do
the wrong thing.</i>

1597
01:25:46,739 --> 01:25:49,784
<i>And sometimes,
she can be too hard on herself.</i>

1598
01:25:50,118 --> 01:25:52,870
<i>But every bit of Riley makes her who she is.</i>

1599
01:25:53,580 --> 01:25:55,790
<i>And we love all of our girl.</i>

1600
01:25:57,167 --> 01:26:01,003
<i>Every messy, beautiful piece of her.</i>

1601
01:26:29,949 --> 01:26:32,244
So, Riley, how was camp?

1602
01:26:33,286 --> 01:26:35,997
Okay, we talked about this.
We tell them everything.

1603
01:26:37,457 --> 01:26:39,626
- But what about sneaking into Coach's office?
- What about hitting Grace?

1604
01:26:39,792 --> 01:26:41,711
- Remember the lying?
- Are we gonna tell her about the Fire Hawks?

1605
01:26:41,878 --> 01:26:43,420
- She doesn't need to know.
- Objection.

1606
01:26:43,421 --> 01:26:44,589
<i>Pardon. Excusez moi.</i>

1607
01:26:45,882 --> 01:26:46,883
It was good.

1608
01:26:49,011 --> 01:26:52,139
She goes away for three days
and all we get is, "good"?

1609
01:26:52,305 --> 01:26:53,431
And what about the red in her hair?

1610
01:26:53,598 --> 01:26:54,599
Did she join a gang?

1611
01:26:54,766 --> 01:26:56,226
Welcome back, Anxiety.

1612
01:26:58,103 --> 01:27:01,731
She goes away for three days
and all we get is, "good"?

1613
01:27:02,357 --> 01:27:04,692
Yeah. Sounds right.
Back to the game.

1614
01:27:04,859 --> 01:27:06,736
<i>With a nice pass over to Reeves...</i>

1615
01:27:06,903 --> 01:27:08,363
<i>comes across center ice.</i>

1616
01:27:08,530 --> 01:27:10,948
<i>Down to the line. Oh, what a move!</i>

1617
01:34:51,284 --> 01:34:53,953
Okay, Deep Dark Secret.

1618
01:34:54,121 --> 01:34:55,330
It's time.

1619
01:34:56,623 --> 01:35:00,127
It's okay. Come on.

1620
01:35:02,337 --> 01:35:04,714
Okay. Let it go, buddy.

1621
01:35:04,881 --> 01:35:06,133
What's the secret?

1622
01:35:08,385 --> 01:35:11,263
We burn hole in rug.

1623
01:35:11,554 --> 01:35:13,431
Really? That's it?

1624
01:35:13,598 --> 01:35:16,018
I thought you were gonna say
the time we peed in the pool.

1625
01:35:17,144 --> 01:35:18,228
No, wait.

1626
01:35:20,230 --> 01:35:21,439
And he's gone.
