001
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,303
You smell that?

002
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:23,811
What?

003
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,063
Piss.

004
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,390
Let's go.
  
005
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:02,537
"A trip to China sounds nice."

006
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,748
If you tread lightly."

007
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:21,105
Get that out of my face,

008
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:23,358
you bald American pig.

009
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:26,444
I may be bald,

010
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:29,113
but you're the one in handcuffs,

011
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:30,531
Soviet scum.

012
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:03,523
Silence, scum.

013
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,257
Tread lightly!

014
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,346
Tread lightly!

015
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:23,764
Who are you?

016
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:26,684
Silver cat... Silver cat.

017
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:28,311
I don't understand.

018
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:32,023
- China?
