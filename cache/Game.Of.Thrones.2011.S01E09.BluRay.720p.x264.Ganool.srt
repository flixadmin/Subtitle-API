1
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,616
[Breathing]

2
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:10,297
[Varys] You've seen better days, my lord.

3
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:13,592
Another visit?

4
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,346
lt seems you're my last friend.

5
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:20,307
No, no, many still love you.

6
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:25,687
Sansa came to court this morning
to plead for your life.

7
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,566
On her knees begging for me. Hm!

8
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:31,818
Did you laugh with the others?

9
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:35,531
You do me wrong, my lord.
Your blood is the last thing l want.

10
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:37,533
l don't know what you want.

11
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:39,284
l've given up trying to guess.

12
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:44,915
When l was still a boy -

13
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,794
before they cut my balls off with a hot knife -

14
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:52,381
l travelled with a group of actors
through the free cities.

15
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:57,010
They taught me that
each man has a role to play.

16
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:59,888
The same is true at court.

17
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:02,266
l am the master of whisperers.

18
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:06,770
My role is to be sly, obsequious
and without scruples.

19
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,856
l'm a good actor, my lord.

20
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:12,234
Huh. Can you free me from this pit?

21
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,361
l could.

22
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:15,821
But will l?

23
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,282
- No.
- [Laughs]

24
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:20,367
As l said, l'm no hero.

25
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:22,244
What do you want? Tell me.

26
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:25,205
No riddles, no stories...
Tell me, what do you want?

27
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:28,917
Peace.

28
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:35,090
Did you know that your son is marching south
with an army of northmen? Loyal lad.

29
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,551
Fighting for his father's freedom.

30
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,845
Robb?

31
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,763
He's just a boy.

32
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:44,099
Boys have been conquerors before.

33
00:03:44,183 --> 00:03:50,772
But the man giving Cersei sleepless nights
is the king's... the late king's brother.

34
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:53,650
Lord Stannis has the best claim to the throne.

35
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:56,945
He is a proven battle commander
and he is utterly without mercy.

36
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:01,450
Stannis Baratheon is Robert's true heir.
The throne is his by rights.

37
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,118
[Varys tuts]

38
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:08,290
Sansa pleaded so sweetly for your life.
It would be a shame to throw it away.

39
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:11,919
Cersei is no fool.

40
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:15,339
She knows a tame wolf
is more use to her than a dead one.

41
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:19,009
You want me to serve the woman who
murdered my king, who butchered my men,

42
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:20,719
who crippled my son?

43
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,763
l want you to serve the realm!

44
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:25,599
Tell the queen you will confess
your vile treason,

45
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:27,726
tell your son to lay down his sword

46
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:31,021
and proclaim Joffrey as the true heir.

47
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:36,109
Cersei knows you as a man of honour.

48
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:40,989
lf you give her the peace she needs,
and promise to carry her secret to your grave,

49
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,700
l believe she will allow you
to take the black

50
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:47,329
and live out your days on the Wall
with your brother and your bastard son.

51
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:48,747
[Chuckles]

52
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:51,375
You think my life
is some precious thing to me?

53
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:56,213
That l would trade my honour
for a few more years of...

54
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,965
Of what?

55
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:04,930
You grew up with actors.

56
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:09,393
You learned their craft and you learnt it well.

57
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:12,855
But l grew up with soldiers.

58
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,317
l learned how to die a long time ago.

59
00:05:20,863 --> 00:05:22,114
Pity.

60
00:05:23,866 --> 00:05:25,075
Such a pity.

61
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:34,334
What of your daughter's life, my lord?

62
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:36,879
ls that a precious thing to you?

63
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:42,843
[Water dripping]

64
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:53,395
[Cawing]

65
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:00,861
[Arrow whooshes]

66
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:21,215
lt's a birthday message
to his grand-niece Walda.

67
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:25,093
- Or so Walder Frey would have you think.
- [Catelyn] Keep shooting them down.

68
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:28,222
We can't risk Lord Walder sending
word of your movements to the Lannisters.

69
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:31,350
He's Grandfather's bannerman.
We can't expect his support?

70
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:35,229
[Greatjon] Expect nothing of Walder Frey
and you'll never be surprised.

71
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:36,522
Look.

72
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,484
[Robb] Father rots in a dungeon.

73
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,694
How long before they take his head?

74
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:45,822
We need to cross the Trident
and we need to do it now.

75
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:48,408
Just march up to his gates
and tell him you're crossing.

76
00:06:48,534 --> 00:06:51,453
We've got five times his numbers.
You can take the Twins if you have to.

77
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:54,957
[Greatjon] Not in time.
Tywin Lannister marches north as we speak.

78
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,751
The Freys have
held the crossing for 600 years,

79
00:06:57,835 --> 00:07:01,004
and for 600 years
they have never failed to exact their toll.

80
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:03,340
Have my horse saddled and ready.

81
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:06,593
Enter the Twins alone and he'll sell you
to the Lannisters as he likes.

82
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:09,513
Or throw you in a dungeon.
Or slit your throat.

83
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:15,269
My father would do whatever it took
to secure our crossing.

84
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,646
Whatever it took.

85
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:22,317
lf l'm going to lead this army, l can't have
other men doing my bargaining for me.

86
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:23,610
l agree.

87
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:26,822
- l'll go.
- [Theon] You can't!

88
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:31,243
l have known Lord Walder since l was a girl.
He would never harm me.

89
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:33,787
[Greatjon] Unless there was a profit in it.

90
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:41,336
What do you want?

91
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:45,048
lt is a great pleasure to see you again
after so many years, my lord.

92
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:46,884
Oh, spare me.

93
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:51,096
Your boy's too proud
to come before me himself.

94
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:53,223
What am l supposed to do with you?

95
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:56,351
Father, you forget yourself.
Lady Stark is here...

96
00:07:56,435 --> 00:08:02,524
Who asked you? You're not Lord Frey yet,
not until l die. Do l look dead to you?

97
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:06,403
- Father, please...
- l need lessons in courtesy from you, bastard?

98
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:11,950
Your mother would still be a milkmaid
if l hadn't squirted you into her belly.

99
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:18,498
All right, you come forward.

100
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:30,177
[Smacking kiss]

101
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,679
There.
Now that l've observed the courtesies,

102
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:36,183
perhaps my sons will do me the honour
of shutting their mouths.

103
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:43,524
ls there somewhere we can talk?

104
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,692
We're talking right now.

105
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:51,240
Fine.

106
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:53,909
Out! All of you!

107
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:05,629
- Oh!
- You too.

108
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:15,180
You see that?

109
00:09:15,264 --> 00:09:17,349
Fifteen, she is.

110
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:19,268
A little flower.

111
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:23,814
And her honey's all mine. [Chuckles]

112
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:28,569
l'm sure she will give you many sons.

113
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:32,322
Huh.
Your father didn't come to the wedding.

114
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:34,366
He is quite ill, my lord.

115
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:37,536
Huh. Didn't come to the last one, either.

116
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:39,913
Or the one before that.

117
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,542
Your family has always pissed on me.

118
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,545
- My lord, l...
- Don't deny it. You know it's true.

119
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:51,091
The fine Lord Tully would never marry
any of his children to mine.

120
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:54,094
- l'm sure there were reasons...
- l didn't need reasons.

121
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:58,932
l needed to get rid of sons and daughters.
You see how they pile up?

122
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:04,479
Why are you here?

123
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,150
To ask you...

124
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,527
to open your gates, my lord...

125
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:15,157
so my son and his bannermen
may cross the Trident and be on their way.

126
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:18,327
- Why should l let him?
- If you could climb your own battlements,

127
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:21,955
you would see that he has
20,OOO men outside your walls.

128
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,459
They'll be 20,OOO corpses
when Tywin Lannister gets here.

129
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:27,878
Don't try and frighten me, Lady Stark.

130
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:30,422
Your husband's in a cell
beneath the Red Keep

131
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:33,383
and your son's got no fur
to keep his balls warm.

132
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:35,802
You swore an oath to my father.

133
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:39,014
Oh, yes, l said some words.

134
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:42,309
And l swore oaths to the crown too,
if l remember right.

135
00:10:43,185 --> 00:10:44,686
Joffrey's king now,

136
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:49,441
which makes your boy and his corpses-to-be
nothing but rebels, it seems to me.

137
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:55,364
lf l had the sense the gods gave a fish,
l'd hand you both over to the Lannisters.

138
00:10:55,447 --> 00:11:00,369
- Why don't you?
- Stark, Tully, Lannister, Baratheon.

139
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:06,250
Give me one good reason why l should
waste a single thought on any of you?

140
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:09,044
- [Man] And...engage!
- [Wind howls]

141
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:11,255
[Door slams]

142
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:14,383
When does Aemon think
you'll be able to use that hand?

143
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:16,677
- Soon, he says.
- Good.

144
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,514
You'll be ready for this, then.

145
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:25,352
l thought a wolf was more
appropriate for you than a bear...

146
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:29,898
so l had a new pommel made.
It's called Longclaw.

147
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:33,694
Works as well for a wolf as a bear, l think.

148
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:46,373
This is Valyrian steel.

149
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:52,045
lt was my father's sword,
his father before him.

150
00:11:52,171 --> 00:11:55,591
The Mormonts have carried it
for five centuries.

151
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:57,718
lt was meant for my son Jorah.

152
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:03,557
He brought dishonour to our House,
but he had the grace to leave the sword

153
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,893
before he fled from Westeros.

154
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:10,063
- My lord, you honour me, but l can't...
- Oh, you can.

155
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,899
And you will.

156
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:15,903
l wouldn't be standing here
if it wasn't for you and your beast.

157
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:18,739
A bloody dead man tried to kill me.

158
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:24,453
So you'll take it.
l'll hear no more about it.

159
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:27,289
- Is that understood?
- Yes, my lord.

160
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:28,957
Right.

161
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:34,963
Now, don't think this means l approve
of this nonsense with you and Alliser Thorne.

162
00:12:35,047 --> 00:12:38,592
That's a man's sword.
It'll take a man to wield it.

163
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,929
l'll apologise to Ser Alliser tonight.

164
00:12:42,054 --> 00:12:45,474
No, you won't.
l sent him to King's Landing yesterday.

165
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:49,603
The hand that your wolf tore off
that thing's wrist...

166
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:52,981
l've, uh, ordered Thorne
to lay it at the feet of this...

167
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:54,983
boy king.

168
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:57,945
That should get young Joffrey's attention.

169
00:12:58,904 --> 00:13:04,117
And it, uh, puts a thousand leagues
between you and Thorne.

170
00:13:04,243 --> 00:13:06,828
Now go and put your sword somewhere safe...

171
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:09,289
and bring me my supper.

172
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:10,999
Yes, my lord.

173
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:24,888
- Well done.
- Well done.

174
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,642
You earned that, Snow.

175
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,648
Well done.

176
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:40,571
Go on, let's have a look.

177
00:13:40,696 --> 00:13:42,990
- At what?
- [Grenn] The sword! Show us the sword.

178
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:46,034
[All] Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword!

179
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:49,371
Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword!

180
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:50,998
[Laughter, cheering]

181
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:56,295
- Let's have a look.
- Piss off.

182
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:58,338
[Laughter, excited chatter]

183
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:02,301
Come on,
l want to have a look at it in the light.

184
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:07,181
[Pyp] Give it here!

185
00:14:07,306 --> 00:14:09,183
What is it?

186
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:11,310
- l...
- Look at its eyes.

187
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:12,978
- Give it.
- l can't.

188
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:15,564
You can't what?

189
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:16,857
l...

190
00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:21,153
l'm really not supposed to say.

191
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:23,906
And yet you really want to say.

192
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:25,991
You want to say that...?

193
00:14:29,328 --> 00:14:32,080
There was a raven.

194
00:14:32,164 --> 00:14:34,082
l read the message to Maester Aemon.

195
00:14:36,502 --> 00:14:38,337
lt's your brother Robb.

196
00:14:38,462 --> 00:14:40,214
What?

197
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:41,882
What about him?

198
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:44,843
He's heading south.

199
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:46,762
To war.

200
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:52,809
All his bannermen have rallied to his side.
They'll keep him safe.

201
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:56,230
l should be there.

202
00:14:58,232 --> 00:14:59,900
l should be with him.

203
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:02,569
[Hoofbeats approaching]

204
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:17,042
lf we do that, they'll never get back across.

205
00:15:18,877 --> 00:15:20,587
[Robb] Well?

206
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:22,381
What did he say?

207
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:26,051
Lord Walder has granted your crossing.

208
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:31,098
- His men are yours, as well.
- [Greatjon] Huh.

209
00:15:31,223 --> 00:15:34,977
Less the 400 he will keep here to hold the
crossing against any who would pursue you.

210
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,436
What does he want in return?

211
00:15:36,562 --> 00:15:40,816
You will be taking on his son Olyvar
as your personal squire.

212
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:43,777
- He expects a knighthood in good time.
- Fine, fine.

213
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:47,406
And?

214
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:50,576
And Arya...

215
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:54,496
will marry his son Waldron
when they both come of age.

216
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:57,291
- She won't be happy about that.
- Hm.

217
00:16:01,003 --> 00:16:02,504
And?

218
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:04,673
And...

219
00:16:06,175 --> 00:16:07,968
when the fighting is done...

220
00:16:10,262 --> 00:16:12,431
you will marry one of his daughters.

221
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:15,517
Whichever you prefer.

222
00:16:15,601 --> 00:16:19,021
He has a number
he thinks will be...suitable.

223
00:16:19,104 --> 00:16:21,023
l see.

224
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:25,194
- Did you get a look at his daughters?
- [Snickering]

225
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:26,695
l did.

226
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:29,156
And?

227
00:16:30,574 --> 00:16:32,075
One was...

228
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:39,750
Do you consent?

229
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:43,462
- Can l refuse?
- Not if you want to cross.

230
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:48,634
Then l consent.

231
00:16:52,304 --> 00:16:53,847
[Chuckles]

232
00:17:24,378 --> 00:17:26,171
[Cawing]

233
00:17:34,555 --> 00:17:36,640
Sam said you wanted to see me?

234
00:17:36,765 --> 00:17:39,142
l did indeed.

235
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:42,229
Perhaps you would
be kind enough to assist me.

236
00:17:45,524 --> 00:17:50,904
Tell me, did you ever wonder
why the men of the Night's Watch

237
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:54,074
take no wives and father no children?

238
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:55,868
No.

239
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:57,703
So they will not love.

240
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:02,249
Love is the death of duty.

241
00:18:02,332 --> 00:18:06,170
lf the day should ever come when
your lord father was forced to choose...

242
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:08,589
between honour on the one hand...

243
00:18:08,672 --> 00:18:11,175
I
and those he loves on the other

244
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:12,551
what would he do?

245
00:18:13,427 --> 00:18:17,764
He... He would do whatever was right.
No matter what.

246
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,019
Then Lord Stark is one man in 10,OOO.

247
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:24,730
Most of us are not so strong.

248
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:27,441
What is honour...

249
00:18:27,608 --> 00:18:30,277
compared to a woman's love?

250
00:18:30,402 --> 00:18:32,779
And what is duty...

251
00:18:32,863 --> 00:18:36,450
against the feel
of a newborn son in your arms?

252
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:38,911
Or a brother's smile?

253
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:44,791
Sam told you.

254
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:46,919
We're all human.

255
00:18:47,044 --> 00:18:50,255
Oh, we all do our duty
when there's no cost to it.

256
00:18:50,339 --> 00:18:53,133
Honour comes easy then.

257
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,718
Yet...

258
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:56,762
sooner or later...

259
00:18:56,845 --> 00:18:58,805
in every man's life...

260
00:18:58,889 --> 00:19:01,934
there comes a day when it is not easy.

261
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:05,103
A day when he must choose.

262
00:19:07,272 --> 00:19:08,982
And this is my day?

263
00:19:09,066 --> 00:19:11,151
ls that what you're saying?

264
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:14,363
Oh, it hurts, boy. Oh, yes.

265
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:17,366
- l know.
- You do not know.

266
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:21,245
No one knows.

267
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,998
l may be a bastard,

268
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:27,626
but he is my father and Robb is my brother.

269
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:28,752
[Chuckles]

270
00:19:31,922 --> 00:19:36,176
The gods were cruel
when they saw fit to test my vows.

271
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,303
They waited till l was old.

272
00:19:39,805 --> 00:19:43,809
What could l do when the ravens
brought the news from the South...

273
00:19:43,976 --> 00:19:46,353
the ruin of my House,
the death of my family?

274
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,355
l was helpless...

275
00:19:48,981 --> 00:19:51,775
blind, frail.

276
00:19:53,652 --> 00:19:55,529
But...

277
00:19:55,654 --> 00:19:59,116
when l heard they had
killed my brother's son...

278
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:01,285
and his poor son...

279
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:02,828
and the children!

280
00:20:02,953 --> 00:20:05,247
Even the little children.

281
00:20:07,749 --> 00:20:09,001
Who are you?

282
00:20:11,128 --> 00:20:14,923
My father was Maekar,

283
00:20:15,007 --> 00:20:17,134
the first of his name.

284
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:21,513
My brother Aegon reigned after him...

285
00:20:21,597 --> 00:20:24,474
when l had refused the throne.

286
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:28,020
And he was followed by his son Aerys...

287
00:20:28,103 --> 00:20:31,064
whom they called the Mad King.

288
00:20:31,148 --> 00:20:32,816
You're Aemon Targaryen.

289
00:20:34,902 --> 00:20:37,613
l'm a maester of the Citadel,

290
00:20:37,696 --> 00:20:41,909
bound in service to Castle Black
and the Night's Watch.

291
00:20:44,912 --> 00:20:48,957
l will not tell you...to stay or go.

292
00:20:49,917 --> 00:20:52,628
You must make that choice yourself...

293
00:20:52,753 --> 00:20:55,964
and live with it for the rest of your days.

294
00:20:59,843 --> 00:21:00,969

304

[Qotho speaks Dothraki] *Me arthas hrazefoon mae.*
He fell from his horse.

[Speaks Dothraki] *Maegi? Anha afichak shafkea nharees zhey Khaleesi.*
The witch? l'll bring you her head, Khaleesi.

314
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:27,264
[Speaks Dothraki] *Fichi mae anhaan ozisa che Khal Drogo achara kifindirgi yer ziganeso anhaan.*
Bring her to me unharmed or Khal Drogo will hear why you defied me.

315
00:22:34,104 --> 00:22:35,314
Hyah! Hyah!

316
00:22:56,001 --> 00:22:59,755
[Kevan] Our scouts tell us the Stark host
has moved south from the Twins

317
00:22:59,922 --> 00:23:02,216
with Lord Frey's levies in tow.

318
00:23:02,341 --> 00:23:04,843
They're a day's march north.

319
00:23:04,968 --> 00:23:07,346
The boy may lack experience and sense,

320
00:23:07,471 --> 00:23:09,932
but he does have a certain mindless...

321
00:23:10,974 --> 00:23:13,602
- provincial courage.
- Ah.

322
00:23:17,022 --> 00:23:19,233
Oh, do continue.
Didn't mean to interrupt.

323
00:23:19,316 --> 00:23:21,735
l do hope your savages
are going to be of some use,

324
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,904
otherwise we've wasted good steel on them.

325
00:23:24,029 --> 00:23:27,407
The great hairy one insisted
he must have two battle axes.

326
00:23:27,533 --> 00:23:29,993
Heavy black steel, double-sided.

327
00:23:30,077 --> 00:23:31,912
Shagga likes axes.

328
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:36,750
When the battle commences,
you and your wildlings will be in the vanguard.

329
00:23:36,834 --> 00:23:38,418
- The vanguard?
- Mm-hm.

330
00:23:38,544 --> 00:23:41,171
Me and the tribesmen on the front lines?

331
00:23:41,255 --> 00:23:43,632
[Kevan] They do seem rather ferocious.

332
00:23:46,218 --> 00:23:47,928
[Tyrion] Ferocious?

333
00:23:48,053 --> 00:23:52,766
Last night... a Moon Brother
stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage.

334
00:23:52,891 --> 00:23:56,603
Three Stone Crows seized the Moon Brother
and opened his throat.

335
00:23:56,728 --> 00:23:59,356
Bronn managed to keep Shagga
from chopping off the dead man's cock,

336
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:03,610
I
which was fortunate, but even still
Ulf is demanding blood money,

337
00:24:03,694 --> 00:24:06,321
which Shagga and Gunthor refuse to pay.

338
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:09,575
When soldiers lack discipline,
the fault lies with their commander.

339
00:24:09,658 --> 00:24:13,203
Surely there are ways to have me killed that
would be less detrimental to the war effort.

340
00:24:13,287 --> 00:24:15,664
There'll be no more discussion on the matter.

341
00:24:21,003 --> 00:24:23,297
lt appears l'm not hungry after all.

342
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,965
Excuse me, my lords.

343
00:24:38,562 --> 00:24:41,190
Where did you find one so pretty
at this hour?

344
00:24:41,315 --> 00:24:43,442
- l took her.
- Took her?

345
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:46,612
- From whom?
- From, uh...

346
00:24:46,695 --> 00:24:48,530
Ser... What's his name?

347
00:24:49,907 --> 00:24:54,494
- l don't know. Ginger cunt, three tents down.
- And he didn't have anything to say about it?

348
00:24:55,996 --> 00:24:57,873
He said something.

349
00:25:00,334 --> 00:25:05,714
Well, the odds of me living long enough for him
to retaliate have just dropped drastically.

350
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:08,091
We'll be at the vanguard tomorrow.

351
00:25:11,053 --> 00:25:12,888
Oh, well. [Sighs]

352
00:25:14,306 --> 00:25:18,310
l, uh...
think l'll go and find myself one.

353
00:25:22,564 --> 00:25:24,316
Who are you?

354
00:25:24,441 --> 00:25:26,777
Who would you like me to be?

355
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,570
What did your mother call you?

356
00:25:28,654 --> 00:25:31,782
Shae. What did your mother call you?

357
00:25:31,907 --> 00:25:34,243
My mother died giving birth to me.

358
00:25:34,952 --> 00:25:37,996
ls that why l'm here?
So we can talk about our mothers?

359
00:25:38,914 --> 00:25:41,416
- What sort of accent is that?
- Foreign.

360
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:43,168
For...

361
00:25:45,045 --> 00:25:46,505
What do you want from me?

362
00:25:47,172 --> 00:25:49,383
What do l want from you?

363
00:25:49,466 --> 00:25:52,469
[Sighs] l want you to share my tent.

364
00:25:52,553 --> 00:25:55,556
l want you to pour my wine,
laugh at my jokes,

365
00:25:55,681 --> 00:25:58,225
rub my legs when they're sore
after a day's ride.

366
00:25:59,017 --> 00:26:02,396
l want you to take no other man to bed
for as long as we're together.

367
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:07,067
And l want you to fuck me
like it's my last night in this world.

368
00:26:07,192 --> 00:26:09,194
Which it may well be.

369
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:10,863
And what do l get?

370
00:26:10,988 --> 00:26:12,573
One - safety.

371
00:26:14,032 --> 00:26:16,743
No one will hurt you
for as long as you're mine.

372
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:20,539
Two - the pleasure of my company,

373
00:26:20,622 --> 00:26:23,250
which l have heard is spectacular.

374
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:25,544
Who told you this?
Women you paid?

375
00:26:25,627 --> 00:26:27,212
And three...

376
00:26:28,088 --> 00:26:31,383
more gold than you can spend
if you lived a thousand years.

377
00:26:33,177 --> 00:26:35,345
Do you accept my proposal?

378
00:26:54,281 --> 00:26:57,242
Let's start with your last night in this world.

379

[Jorah] Khaleesi.

382
00:27:31,693 --> 00:27:32,736
Come.

383
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,282
He's very strong.

384
00:27:37,366 --> 00:27:40,118
No one understands how strong he is.

385
00:27:54,925 --> 00:27:56,885
[Daenerys gasps]

386
00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:02,140
- He will die tonight, Khaleesi.
- He can't.

387
00:28:02,975 --> 00:28:04,893
He can't. l won't let him.

388
00:28:05,018 --> 00:28:08,105
Even a queen doesn't have that power.

389
00:28:10,983 --> 00:28:14,236
We must go quickly.
l've heard there's a good port in Asshai.

390
00:28:14,361 --> 00:28:18,407
- l won't leave him.
- He's already gone, Khaleesi.

Even if he dies...

why would l run?

395
00:28:29,543 --> 00:28:34,089
l am khaleesi, and my...
my son will be khal after Drogo.

396
00:28:34,214 --> 00:28:37,342
This isn't Westeros, where men honour blood.

397
00:28:37,426 --> 00:28:42,055
Here they only honour strength.
There will be fighting after Drogo dies.

398
00:28:42,181 --> 00:28:44,892
Whoever wins that fight will be the new khal.

399

He won't want any rivals.

400

and given to the dogs.

He's beyond the healer's skills.

All l can do is ease his path.

Save him and l will free you. l swear it.

You must know a way.

Some magic.

00:34:18,016 --> 00:34:19,643
..iscoming.

465
00:34:19,768 --> 00:34:23,564
- Fetch the midwives.
- They will not come. They say she is cursed.

466
00:34:25,023 --> 00:34:27,150
They'll come or l'll have their heads.

467
00:34:27,234 --> 00:34:28,360
[Groans]

468
00:34:28,443 --> 00:34:32,072
The witch - she can bring baby.
l hear her say so.

469
00:34:33,448 --> 00:34:35,450
[Singing, demonic bellowing]

[Singing, bellowing continues]

471
00:34:55,512 --> 00:34:57,181
[Shae] Are you in agony, my lion?

472
00:34:57,306 --> 00:34:59,683
- No.
- You look like you're in agony.

473
00:35:00,601 --> 00:35:03,228
The fire is burning your pretty soft skin.

474
00:35:06,857 --> 00:35:08,483
- Ah!
- [Laughter]

475
00:35:10,194 --> 00:35:12,779
Damn you, woman.
Are you immune to pain?

476
00:35:12,863 --> 00:35:14,948
- Just used to it.
- Drink.

477
00:35:17,201 --> 00:35:19,077
[Tyrion] Let's play a new game.

478
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:23,165
There's a Braavosi knife game
l could teach you.

479
00:35:23,248 --> 00:35:26,376
Does it involve the potential
for losing fingers?

480
00:35:26,502 --> 00:35:29,004
- Not if you win.
- No!

481
00:35:29,129 --> 00:35:31,673
No fire games, no knife games.

482
00:35:32,591 --> 00:35:36,637
- Let's do something l'm good at.
- What are you good at?

483
00:35:36,678 --> 00:35:38,639
l happen to be a great judge of character.

484
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,974
- This sounds like a boring game.
- It's not.

485
00:35:41,099 --> 00:35:45,187
Here's how it works -
l make a statement about your past.

486
00:35:45,312 --> 00:35:48,440
lf l'm right, you drink.
If l'm wrong, l drink.

487
00:35:48,524 --> 00:35:51,443
And no lying.
l'll know if you're lying.

488
00:35:51,568 --> 00:35:53,362
l don't want to play this game.

489
00:35:53,529 --> 00:35:55,447
Fine. Bronn first.

490
00:36:00,077 --> 00:36:01,912
Your father beat you.

491
00:36:07,543 --> 00:36:09,545
But my mother hit harder.

492
00:36:13,006 --> 00:36:15,509
You killed your first man
before you were 12.

493
00:36:15,592 --> 00:36:17,386
lt was a woman.

494
00:36:20,722 --> 00:36:22,015
She swung an axe at me.

495
00:36:23,809 --> 00:36:25,394
You've been north of the Wall.

496
00:36:28,772 --> 00:36:30,482
What brought you up there?

497
00:36:32,109 --> 00:36:33,861
- Work.
- And...

498
00:36:34,987 --> 00:36:38,365
you once loved a woman many years ago,
but it turned out badly

499
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:40,284
so you've never let yourself love again.

500
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,454
Oh, wait, that's me.

501
00:36:47,749 --> 00:36:50,502
Your turn, my mysterious foreign beauty.

502
00:36:50,586 --> 00:36:52,171
l don't want to play.

503
00:36:52,254 --> 00:36:56,049
lt's fun! Look at the fun we're having.

504
00:36:59,595 --> 00:37:01,638
Your mother was a whore.

505
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:03,849
Drink.

506
00:37:10,397 --> 00:37:12,524
All right.

507
00:37:12,608 --> 00:37:16,028
Your father left the family when
you were very young, never to return.

508
00:37:16,153 --> 00:37:17,279
Drink.

509
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:21,366
- And we've established the rules about lying?
- Drink!

510
00:37:24,703 --> 00:37:26,288
- [Bronn pours]
- Mm.

511
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:30,334
You wanted a different life.

512
00:37:30,459 --> 00:37:33,170
You came from somewhere
and you wanted to be elsewhere.

513
00:37:33,295 --> 00:37:35,964
The whole shit-stained world
could drink off that one.

514
00:37:36,006 --> 00:37:38,133
So, specifics...

515
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:41,762
You wanted to be elsewhere,
but how would you get there?

516
00:37:41,845 --> 00:37:45,641
l don't believe the life
of the Silent Sisters is for you.

517
00:37:45,766 --> 00:37:49,436
So...what's a lowborn girl to do?

518
00:37:53,065 --> 00:37:54,316
Drink.

519
00:37:57,194 --> 00:37:58,904
- Are you sure...
- Drink!

520
00:38:04,493 --> 00:38:08,288
And don't talk about
my mother and father ever,

521
00:38:08,372 --> 00:38:10,916
or l will carve your eyes from your head.

522
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:18,298
My dear lady,
if l have offended you, l apologise.

523
00:38:19,508 --> 00:38:20,425
My turn.

524
00:38:20,592 --> 00:38:22,636
Fine, fine.

525
00:38:22,761 --> 00:38:24,221
Ask away.

526
00:38:25,055 --> 00:38:28,016
Try to penetrate the enigma that is me.

527
00:38:28,058 --> 00:38:31,061
- Who were you in love with?
- That's not how the game works.

528
00:38:31,144 --> 00:38:33,522
l don't care the way the game works.

529
00:38:33,647 --> 00:38:35,607
Our lord here used to be married.

530
00:38:36,567 --> 00:38:38,652
- Married?
- How did you hear that?

531
00:38:38,819 --> 00:38:42,114
You hear lots of things
playing dice with Lannister soldiers.

532
00:38:44,658 --> 00:38:46,243
Another night, perhaps.

533
00:38:47,411 --> 00:38:49,413
Not another night. This night.

534
00:38:50,956 --> 00:38:52,583
lt's not a pleasant story.

535
00:38:54,585 --> 00:38:56,128
Oh, maybe l will cry.

536
00:38:56,211 --> 00:39:00,757
l'm guessing the lady and l can tell more
unpleasant stories than your lordship.

537
00:39:02,926 --> 00:39:04,970
So...

538
00:39:08,348 --> 00:39:14,062
l was 16. My brother Jaime and l were riding,
when we heard a scream.

539
00:39:14,188 --> 00:39:18,692
She ran out onto the road,
clothes half torn off, with two men on her heels.

540
00:39:18,775 --> 00:39:23,280
Jaime scared away the men easily enough,
while l wrapped her in my cloak.

541
00:39:23,405 --> 00:39:25,199
She was too scared to send off on her own,

542
00:39:25,324 --> 00:39:30,287
so while Jaime hunted down the rapers
l took her to the nearest inn and fed her.

543
00:39:30,495 --> 00:39:32,831
Her name was Tysha.

544
00:39:32,998 --> 00:39:35,167
She was a wheelwright's orphan.

545
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:37,461
And she was hungry.

546
00:39:37,544 --> 00:39:40,839
Together we finished off three chickens
and a flagon of wine.

547
00:39:40,964 --> 00:39:45,135
lmpossible as it seems, there was a time
when l was unaccustomed to wine.

548
00:39:45,177 --> 00:39:48,347
l forgot how afraid l was around girls...

549
00:39:48,472 --> 00:39:51,850
how l was always waiting
for them to laugh at me or...

550
00:39:51,975 --> 00:39:53,185
look away embarrassed,

551
00:39:53,352 --> 00:39:56,063
or ask me about my tall, handsome brother.

552
00:39:56,146 --> 00:39:58,524
l forgot about everything but Tysha.

553
00:39:59,775 --> 00:40:02,569
And somehow l found myself in her bed.

554
00:40:02,694 --> 00:40:05,572
For three chickens, l should hope so.

555
00:40:05,656 --> 00:40:08,742
lt didn't last long.
l didn't know what the hell l was doing.

556
00:40:08,825 --> 00:40:11,203
But she was good to me.

557
00:40:11,245 --> 00:40:13,288
She kissed me afterwards and...

558
00:40:14,289 --> 00:40:15,791
San9 me a SOn9.

559
00:40:17,376 --> 00:40:20,921
And by morning
l was deep enough in love to ask for her hand.

560
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,299
A few lies, a few gold coins,
one drunken septon

561
00:40:24,341 --> 00:40:26,552
and there you have it - man and wife.

562
00:40:27,886 --> 00:40:32,599
For a fortnight anyway,
until the septon sobered up and told my father.

563
00:40:32,683 --> 00:40:35,227
Well, l imagine that was the end of all that.

564
00:40:35,269 --> 00:40:36,812
Not quite.

565
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:40,941
First, my father had Jaime tell me the truth.

566
00:40:43,068 --> 00:40:45,070
The girl was a whore, you see.

567
00:40:46,697 --> 00:40:51,785
Jaime had arranged the whole thing -
the road, the rapers...all of it.

568
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:54,371
He thought it was time l had a woman.

569
00:40:56,456 --> 00:40:58,542
After my brother confessed...

570
00:40:59,835 --> 00:41:01,712
my father brought in my wife

571
00:41:01,837 --> 00:41:03,755
and gave her to his guards.

572
00:41:05,257 --> 00:41:08,010
He paid her well -
a silver for each man.

573
00:41:08,093 --> 00:41:11,013
How many whores command
that kind of price?

574
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:16,310
He brought me into the barracks
and made me watch.

575
00:41:16,393 --> 00:41:19,730
By the end, she had so much silver

576
00:41:19,897 --> 00:41:24,568
that the coins were slipping through her fingers
and rolling on to the floor.

577
00:41:28,488 --> 00:41:31,450
l would have killed the man
who did that to me.

578
00:41:32,409 --> 00:41:34,536
You should have known she was a whore.

579
00:41:35,412 --> 00:41:36,455
Really?

580
00:41:37,331 --> 00:41:39,833
l was 16, drunk and in love.

581
00:41:39,917 --> 00:41:45,255
A girl who was almost raped doesn't invite
another man into her bed two hours later.

582
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:49,927
As l said, l was young and stupid.

583
00:41:52,554 --> 00:41:54,848
You are still young and stupid.

00:45:02,494 --> 00:45:05,122
We wouldn't be having
this conversation if we didn't.

How did our tribesmen do?

00:45:21,972 --> 00:45:24,141
Yeah, good.

629
00:45:25,184 --> 00:45:29,479
[Tyrion] It's nice to see them getting along.
[Tywin] You're wounded.

630
00:45:30,689 --> 00:45:32,608
Good of you to notice.

631
00:45:33,483 --> 00:45:34,776
l hear we won.

632
00:45:34,902 --> 00:45:37,446
Huh! The scouts were wrong.

633
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:41,200
There were 2,OOO Stark bannermen, not 20.

634
00:45:42,242 --> 00:45:44,411
Did we get the Stark boy, at least?

635
00:45:44,494 --> 00:45:45,954
He wasn't here.

636
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:48,540
Where was he?

637
00:45:48,624 --> 00:45:51,001
With his other 18,OOO men.

638
00:45:54,713 --> 00:45:56,840
And where are they?

639
00:46:06,934 --> 00:46:08,894
- We should go, my lady.
- No!

640
00:46:14,233 --> 00:46:15,651
My lady!

By the time they knew what was happening,
it had already happened.

644
00:46:58,777 --> 00:47:02,823
Lady Stark. l'd offer you my sword,
but l seem to have lost it.

645
00:47:02,948 --> 00:47:04,867
lt is not your sword l want.

646
00:47:06,326 --> 00:47:07,995
Give me my daughters back.

647
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:09,955
Give me my husband.

648
00:47:10,789 --> 00:47:12,541
l've lost them too, l'm afraid.

649
00:47:12,666 --> 00:47:15,127
[Theon] Kill him, Robb.
Send his head to his father.

650
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:20,048
- He cut down ten of our men. You saw him.
- He's more use to us alive than dead.

651
00:47:20,132 --> 00:47:23,218
[Catelyn] Take him away and put him in irons.

652
00:47:23,343 --> 00:47:25,846
We could end this war right now, boy,

653
00:47:25,971 --> 00:47:27,973
save thousands of lives.

654
00:47:28,098 --> 00:47:30,976
You fight for the Starks,
l fight for the Lannisters.

655
00:47:31,101 --> 00:47:33,061
Swords or lances, teeth, nails -

656
00:47:33,187 --> 00:47:36,899
choose your weapons
and let's end this here and now.

657
00:47:39,401 --> 00:47:41,528
lf we do it your way, kingslayer...

658
00:47:42,613 --> 00:47:44,323
you'd win.

659
00:47:47,451 --> 00:47:48,994
We're not doing it your way.

660
00:47:50,871 --> 00:47:52,748
[Greatjon] Come on, pretty man.

661

[Laughter, cheering]

662
00:48:01,673 --> 00:48:06,512

- The bards will sing songs of their sacrifice.

663
00:48:06,637 --> 00:48:09,640
Aye. But the dead won't hear them.

664
00:48:16,647 --> 00:48:19,358
One victory does not make us conquerors.

665
00:48:21,193 --> 00:48:23,278
Did we free my father?

666
00:48:24,279 --> 00:48:26,782
Did we rescue my sisters from the queen?

667
00:48:28,242 --> 00:48:31,870
Did we free the North from those
who want us on our knees?

668
00:48:37,334 --> 00:48:39,503
This war is far from over.

A lemon one...or any of them.

672
00:49:14,413 --> 00:49:16,081
Three coppers.

673
00:49:16,874 --> 00:49:20,544
- How about a nice fat pigeon?
- Oh, piss off now. Go on.

674
00:49:21,628 --> 00:49:24,464
Do you have any stale ones from yesterday?
Or any burnt ones?

675
00:49:24,548 --> 00:49:26,091
Piss off!

676
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:35,475
Hey, where's everyone going?
What's happening?

677
00:49:35,559 --> 00:49:37,769
- They're taking him to the Sept of Baelor.
- Who?

678
00:49:37,895 --> 00:49:39,813

and Hand of the King.

690
00:51:37,472 --> 00:51:39,933
l come before you to confess my treason...

691
00:51:41,101 --> 00:51:43,020
in the sight of gods and men.

692
00:51:45,022 --> 00:51:46,690
l betrayed the faith of my king...

693
00:51:47,774 --> 00:51:49,818
and the trust of my friend Robert.

694

Joffrey Baratheon...

by the grace of all the gods,
