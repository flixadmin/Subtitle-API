1
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,458
-Dad.
-Yes, I'll tell him now.

2
00:00:13,875 --> 00:00:16,291
Of course, now when he... I don't know.

3
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:18,916
OK. Dad, here he comes.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,833
Here he comes.

5
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,833
Professor, would you like some coffee?

6
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,166
Well... yes, that'd be great, thank you.

7
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:32,916
Good morning.

8
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:39,000
Here is your coffee.

9
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:40,291
And some cookies?

10
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:42,833
Yes... thank you.

11
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:49,791
What is it?

12
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,500
Let's see.

13
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:55,541
-Just one thing.
-Yes.

14
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:58,000
A small matter.

15
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:01,666
-Do you have any siblings?
-Moscow, please.

16
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:04,750
No personal questions.
It's one of the first rules.

17
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:08,333
I have a friend
who's practically a brother to me.

18
00:01:08,416 --> 00:01:11,791
He was with me in the mine,
on robberies, and in prison.

19
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:13,166
That's the problem.

20
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:16,375
I got let out,
but he still has five years left.

21
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:17,791
Five years, Professor.

22
00:01:17,875 --> 00:01:21,958
Yes, well, sorry,
but I don't see what I can do for your...

23
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:24,333
friend, brother, or whoever.

24
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:25,958
No, his son.

25
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:28,291
-His son?
-Yes, Juanito. My godson.

26
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:30,291
And he's like a brother to me.

27
00:01:30,375 --> 00:01:33,708
I promised I'd look after him
when I got out of prison.

28
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:37,833
We haven't seen him for a while,
and we've heard he's not doing well.

29
00:01:37,916 --> 00:01:40,458
He's out of work, almost destitute.

30
00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:44,291
I thought I could get him back on track
and bring him here.

31
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:48,500
-Being in a heist is back on track?
-Well, this is a respectable heist.

32
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:53,291
Just look at this guy.
I've never seen him so focused in my life.

33
00:01:53,375 --> 00:01:56,750
If it goes well,
there'll be plenty to go around, right?

34
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:58,666
-I'm sorry but--
-Professor.

35
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:01,833
The guy's awesome.
I've known him since we were kids.

36
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:03,708
He's a pro at everything:

37
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,250
cars, break-ins...

38
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:09,541
Why do we call you Denver and you Moscow?
And him Helsinki? For safety.

39
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:12,958
No one can know each other's names.
We can't--

40
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:14,291
-Yeah.
-Let's see.

41
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:17,458
I made an exception for your son.
Now your godson?

42
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:21,250
This isn't a family business.
We can't take on every cousin--

43
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:23,000
What are you saying, loser?

44
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:24,583
-Sorry?
-He's the Professor.

45
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:27,833
We're talking about a kid
who's almost destitute, Dad.

46
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:30,083
We're saying we'd trust him
with our lives,

47
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:32,583
and he comes out with
that shit about city names!

48
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:35,875
Do you know what you can do
with the name "Denver"?

49
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:38,916
You can stick it up your ass.
My name is Dani, Dad.

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,333
I'm Dani, always have been. Also:

51
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:44,375
your infallible plan for the Royal Mint

52
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:47,208
is really fucking shit.

53
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:50,416
Print the bills at a print shop.
It'll be cheaper.

54
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:52,875
Thank you for the coffee.

55
00:02:57,458 --> 00:03:01,250
That better be the last time
you speak to him like that.

56
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:04,958
I'm ashamed of you.
Can't you see he's an intellectual?

57
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:07,916
Well, to each their own.

58
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,583
You have to trust that man
and respect him.

59
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:13,291
-Don't I respect him?
-No.

60
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:16,958
No, maybe the kid's right.

61
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:20,708
If we print them at home,
we'd save ourselves a lot of trouble.

62
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:23,041
And the cost of weapons...

63
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:24,625
of ammunition...

64
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:30,416
Denver, you bring the printer,
we'll download the bills on the internet.

65
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:35,125
A stroke of genius. No, even better...

66
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:38,375
I draw the bills, and you color them.

67
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:41,291
Perhaps we can make two a day.

68
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:44,708
Look how good I am at drawing.

69
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:48,916
It's called "Passion for Juanito."

70
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:51,833
Are you gonna keep this up?

71
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:56,166
Maybe I'll start throwing punches,
and you'll be printing new teeth.

72
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,541
Fuck off.

73
00:03:57,625 --> 00:04:00,166
Denver, don't get mad. It's a joke.

74
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,875
<i>I woke up in lockdown within our lockdown.</i>

75
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:16,250
<i>In chains, dazed,</i>
<i>and with a madman in front of me.</i>

76
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:20,166
<i>I'd lost my freedom,</i>
<i>and I was running out of time.</i>

77
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,041
<i>Within only 15 minutes</i>
<i>of me opening my eyes,</i>

78
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,958
<i>Gandía would've already shot</i>
<i>at most of us.</i>

79
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,375
What are you doing?

80
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:36,458
I won't hit you
because you're tied up.

81
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:38,000
Let me go.

82
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:40,541
Then we'll see who's punching who.

83
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:50,166
Why didn't you kill me?

84
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:53,708
-I'm no murderer.
-You're not a murderer?

85
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,083
You tried to kill Nairobi and Helsinki,
and you're not a murderer?

86
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:02,708
Why didn't you kill me?

87
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:05,500
{\an8}You're my guinea pig.

88
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,166
{\an8}And you?

89
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,291
{\an8}What the hell are you?

90
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,708
{\an8}I'm the tamer.

91
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:17,166
{\an8}And you're lucky.

92
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:20,083
{\an8}I'm going to tame you.

93
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:31,041
{\an8}The next time you kick me,
I'll beat you so hard,

94
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:33,625
{\an8}your crippled friend
won't recognize you.

95
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,708
{\an8}Keep still.

96
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,333
{\an8}Listen to me. I'll explain.

97
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:44,000
{\an8}It's very easy.

98
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:47,833
{\an8}Son of a bitch.

99
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,083
{\an8}Look.

100
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:53,541
{\an8}My first card is you:

101
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:55,875
{\an8}missing.

102
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:02,166
{\an8}They have no choice but to look for you.
And they're going about it like maniacs.

103
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:08,875
{\an8}Divided and nervous. I'm already winning.

104
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,458
{\an8}The next card:

105
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,583
{\an8}break up the team.

106
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,166
{\an8}Didn't you wonder how I escaped?

107
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:25,625
{\an8}This is Gandía,

108
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:28,333
{\an8}<i>head of security at the Bank of Spain.</i>

109
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:29,791
{\an8}<i>I'm hidden,</i>

110
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:33,666
{\an8}<i>safe and sound,</i>
<i>and ready to undertake any action</i>

111
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,833
{\an8}<i>that may be necessary to regain</i>

112
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:38,916
{\an8}-control and safety--
<i>-</i>He wants to kill us one by one!

113
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,916
{\an8}<i>Stay together. He's watching!</i>

114
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:44,791
{\an8}As you've just heard,
I'm in wonderful company.

115
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:54,208
{\an8}You need to start behaving better.

116
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:57,750
{\an8}Otherwise, you'll end up immobilized,

117
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:02,250
{\an8}tied up, gagged, and blindfolded.

118
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:07,958
{\an8}Then we won't be able to
get to know each other, OK?

119
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:17,916
{\an8}I just wanted to thank Palermo.

120
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,916
{\an8}<i>His tip on escaping from my handcuffs</i>
<i>by dislocating my thumb</i>

121
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,708
{\an8}<i>made me a free man.</i>

122
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:26,666
{\an8}<i>Thanks to him,</i>
<i>I hope to be able to help you.</i>

123
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,166
{\an8}And all hell breaks loose...

124
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:34,583
{\an8}Is that true?

125
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:38,833
{\an8}If you prefer to believe a psychopath
over one of us, that's up to you.

126
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:42,541
Silence. You can speak at your trial,
son of a bitch.

127
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:59,583
-I need to use the bathroom.
-Later.

128
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:00,916
I'm telling you...

129
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,791
my stomach doesn't feel good.

130
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:07,625
I need to go to the bathroom urgently.

131
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:18,750
What's wrong?

132
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:20,458
The museum is big.

133
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:26,375
And 60, 70 hostages
are difficult to manage.

134
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:29,000
The tiniest spark
could ignite a rebellion.

135
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:31,041
No.

136
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:35,500
That would be suicide. In these cases,
survival instinct prevails.

137
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:38,833
Or not. Fear.

138
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,916
Fear and more fear.
They could do anything.

139
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Like setting upon one of us
even though we have M16s.

140
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:51,250
-What have you got in mind?
-An infiltrator.

141
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:56,666
They wouldn't have any contact with us
unless there's a rebellion.

142
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:00,166
If there are no problems,
they'll leave with the hostages.

143
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:04,166
It's a job the smoking monkey
from the Ringling Circus could do.

144
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,583
And this Juanito guy could do it.

145
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,250
Here it comes.

146
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:36,541
Is that him?

147
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:38,041
-No.
-No.

148
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:41,125
-Well, that was his bus.
-I know.

149
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:42,875
It's a bad start. Let's go.

150
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:45,625
No, Professor. Maybe he just got confused.

151
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:47,500
Or got off at the wrong stop.

152
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:49,208
Yeah, the wrong stop.

153
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:51,583
-And he's there--
-He got confused?

154
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,250
Godfather.

155
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,416
My God.

156
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:06,958
It's me.

157
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:09,291
Juanito?

158
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:11,958
Julia.

159
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:15,166
It's been too long, hasn't it?

160
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:19,041
You look stunning, my girl.

161
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,875
Well...

162
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:24,333
you've always been handsome. Pretty.

163
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:26,083
Those eyes...

164
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:27,958
that mouth, that smile...

165
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,916
You're beautiful, Julia.

166
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:39,666
What's wrong, Daniel?

167
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:42,208
Is this weird for you?

168
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:46,666
No. Not at all.
I... I think it's fucking great.

169
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:51,458
Everyone is free to do
whatever they want with whatever.

170
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:53,333
So?

171
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:57,500
Well, I look you in the eyes,
and you're still Juanito, but...

172
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,041
you look so hot!

173
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:03,958
-Come here, give me a hug.
-Wow.

174
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:09,291
Hey, does your father know?

175
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:12,166
I saw him a year ago,
and he didn't mention it.

176
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,583
My father wholly supports me.

177
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:17,583
He says he always wanted a daughter.
He's sweet.

178
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:20,500
Who's this?

179
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:24,583
The guy behind the job?

180
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,166
That's right.

181
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,541
And what does the job involve?

182
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:36,625
Gandía's telling the truth.
Palermo helped him.

183
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:39,958
-How do you know?
-I saw him pointing at his thumb.

184
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:42,708
They were talking.
Palermo kept going over.

185
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:43,750
Why didn't you say?

186
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:47,208
I couldn't hear. I didn't know
he'd tell him to break his thumb.

187
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:49,041
Get closer. You're not tied up.

188
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:52,750
No, I'm here to watch the hostages,
not to watch you guys.

189
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:01,791
-You hear a lot of shit in here.
-I know.

190
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,958
How is Nairobi?

191
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:06,791
She's recovering as best she can.

192
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:10,125
With Tokyo captured, that's two down.

193
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:13,625
We're starting to look a bit screwed,
right?

194
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:16,250
Julia. What do you want?

195
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:20,541
Let me go. Give me a gun.
Let me join the others.

196
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:22,833
My butt's going numb from sitting.

197
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:25,416
They need to think you're a hostage
in case it gets bad.

198
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,208
-Worse than this?
-Just go back to your place.

199
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:31,458
Matías is down there
with a gun he can barely hold.

200
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:33,333
No, orders are orders.

201
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:38,000
-You have to go back to your place.
-You give the orders. You're in charge.

202
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,416
-I'm not in charge.
-Of course you are.

203
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,666
Nairobi was shot,
Tokyo's been captured,

204
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:46,875
Palermo... How can we trust him?
Think about it. You're next in line.

205
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:49,041
-No one else.
-You're stressing me out.

206
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:52,333
Start giving orders.

207
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:55,166
Give me a gun,
a bulletproof vest, whatever.

208
00:13:55,583 --> 00:14:00,208
And... call me Manila,
because I'm Manila, Dani.

209
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:03,250
You're not Manila yet.
You're still a hostage.

210
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:06,666
And don't call me Dani. My name is Denver.
Let's go.

211
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:09,250
And another thing:

212
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:12,750
don't stare at me.
People are starting to notice.

213
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:13,916
Stare?

214
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:16,791
I was sending you signals, you idiot.

215
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:17,875
"Intently."

216
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,458
It's a fucking sauna in here.

217
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:31,333
Turn the AC on.

218
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:33,541
If I turn it on, they'll find us.

219
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:35,083
That would be a shame.

220
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:38,541
Of course. We have so much to talk about.

221
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,125
Without the AC, there's not much oxygen,

222
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,791
so you should ration your breathing.

223
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:48,666
Don't you worry about me.

224
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,375
They've broken into
the vault of the national reserve.

225
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:56,333
What do you think they'll do
to your shitty bunker?

226
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:58,833
You're dead.

227
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:03,583
You're sweaty. Shall I open your jumpsuit?
We can't have poor hygiene--

228
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:06,208
Touch me, and I'll rip your arm off.

229
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,833
Hey, what happened with that boy?

230
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:14,791
The one with curly hair.
He doesn't turn you on anymore?

231
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:19,708
Like crazy.

232
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:23,041
I don't think so.
For you, kids and IT guys...

233
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:28,916
I set up this heist for him.

234
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:35,583
What's the most someone's done for you?
Given you a drill on Father's Day?

235
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,583
Real men are more your type.

236
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,416
-Like you.
-Like me.

237
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,333
Of course.

238
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:43,250
You've even stopped kicking me.

239
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:46,416
Because you tied my legs,
you fucking idiot.

240
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,750
Well, whatever the reason...
the main thing is, you're more receptive.

241
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:55,875
And your toenails are painted.

242
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:58,541
I love it.

243
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,916
<i>Is it true you helped Gandía escape?</i>

244
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,875
Yes, sir.

245
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:07,833
<i>Are you aware he almost killed</i>
<i>Nairobi and Helsinki?</i>

246
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:09,041
Collateral damage.

247
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:12,208
-Collateral damage? Bastard!
-Take it easy.

248
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:14,041
Why did you do it, Palermo?

249
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:16,291
<i>Tokyo staged a coup, sir.</i>

250
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:18,750
I felt morally obligated

251
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,916
to save the plan.
That's where my loyalty lies.

252
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,708
I had to restore the established order,
because you never relieved me of my post.

253
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:29,125
<i>I did it de facto.</i>

254
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:32,250
Besides, that has nothing to do with
freeing Gandía.

255
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:33,208
<i>It does.</i>

256
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:36,500
I had to create chaos.
It was clear he'd target her.

257
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:38,541
He could have killed her.

258
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:42,083
-I repeat, she staged a coup, sir.
-It's all lies!

259
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:45,916
He was going to escape like a rat!
He had the state secrets.

260
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,833
The kid is mistaken.

261
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:50,833
I stopped you at the door,
with the briefcase.

262
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,458
You were gonna negotiate, jerk.

263
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:57,041
That so? With the documents I stole?
The briefcase is there.

264
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:59,791
-Why don't you have a look?
-Denver, open it.

265
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:06,666
What's inside?

266
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:09,166
Muffins.

267
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:16,500
Whatever's in the briefcase,
it makes no difference.

268
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:20,458
<i>You betrayed the gang.</i>

269
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,208
You put everyone in danger,

270
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:25,208
and thanks to you,
Gandía has my commanding officer.

271
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,833
Listen, I'm going to give you
one chance to make amends.

272
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:35,333
But I won't forget what you did.
And of course, you won't be in charge.

273
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:39,666
So I go back to the lobby
with the hostages? What do I do?

274
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,166
First of all, shut up.

275
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,500
And no, you won't go back there.
Release him.

276
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:50,000
With a killer here, we can't be divided.

277
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:51,583
<i>When all this is over,</i>

278
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:54,083
then we'll decide his sentence.

279
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,125
<i>Now, listen closely.</i>

280
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:26,750
<i>With a lone wolf out there,</i>

281
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:31,041
the most vulnerable place is the lobby.
We need to evacuate it.

282
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:34,666
Palermo, Stockholm, Helsinki,
get the hostages to the library.

283
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:38,083
He wants to kill you, not escape.
The door doesn't matter.

284
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:39,541
Do not wear your masks.

285
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:42,166
He could do the same,
and he would blend in.

286
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:45,916
Bogotá, what's the situation
in the foundry?

287
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,083
The furnaces are off. They're scared.

288
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:52,666
Take Nairobi to the library, then go down.
The foundry cannot be idle.

289
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:54,541
Denver.

290
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:57,791
-Yes.
<i>-You and Rio will act. Begin the hunt.</i>

291
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:01,416
<i>You will be the most exposed.</i>
<i>Equip yourselves well.</i>

292
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,125
Helmets, ammunition, magazines.
Everything you need.

293
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:07,458
Sweep the first floor.
Once you finish a room, seal it.

294
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:08,833
And the other floors?

295
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:12,541
<i>Helsinki and Stockholm will do them</i>
<i>once hostages are in the library.</i>

296
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:16,208
Everyone know what to do?

297
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:18,500
-Yes, sir.
-Yes.

298
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:20,833
One more thing.

299
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,125
Good luck.

300
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:27,166
Be very careful.

301
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:28,583
Let's go!

302
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:42,791
-How are you feeling, little one?
-Fine.

303
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:44,791
I have a good nurse.

304
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:50,000
You like the big guy, huh?

305
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:52,208
Maybe.

306
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:54,583
Hang in there.

307
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,250
You too.

308
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:09,000
Wow, that woman is so drunk, Helsinki.

309
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:13,208
Do you know what she said? She said,
"What a hunk you've got yourself."

310
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:17,166
She means you.
Everyone thinks we're husband and wife.

311
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,708
Better. That way, no one notices us.

312
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:23,250
It's not better.
Neither of us will get any action.

313
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,708
Never mind action, Nairobi. Cheers.

314
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:32,625
A day or two is OK, but at this rate,
we'll become virgins again.

315
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:37,833
Truth is, you and I
make an excellent couple.

316
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:42,291
You and I?

317
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,166
We're family, that's for sure.

318
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:45,791
Forever.

319
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:48,250
Well, that's why.

320
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:51,666
I've been through more with you
than with anyone.

321
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:53,916
This, Helsi...

322
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:57,375
is a love story.

323
00:20:57,958 --> 00:21:00,500
One of those beautiful love stories.

324
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:07,291
No. Someday someone will show up,

325
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:09,625
and that will be love.

326
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:11,916
But this isn't.

327
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,083
You have to be free and brave.

328
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:19,916
Because believe me,
you need more courage for love...

329
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,208
than for war.

330
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:24,166
And you...

331
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:26,708
you're brave.

332
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:30,916
Put it on.

333
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:35,750
We're going to the foundry.

334
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:39,208
We're going to the library.

335
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:41,375
Those are the orders.

336
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,541
Bogotá.

337
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:49,708
Don't fuck with me.

338
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:51,791
They're scared, right?

339
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:54,791
If so, they won't last 5 minutes
against Gandía.

340
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:57,333
I need to speak to them.

341
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,041
When did you eat last?

342
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:06,125
Two days ago.

343
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:11,166
-Maybe three.
-And the last time you slept?

344
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:18,958
I've slept twice since I arrived,
two hours each time. Anything else?

345
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:27,250
Before you eat,
I'm going to clean that wound.

346
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:49,958
Stay still.

347
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:53,541
Your hair is all stuck in it.

348
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:56,875
I hit you hard, didn't I?

349
00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:06,666
-<i>Library clear.</i>
-Copy that.

350
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:10,750
Everyone on your feet
and into four lines.

351
00:23:10,833 --> 00:23:12,666
Dear hostages...

352
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,958
I am back.

353
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:19,500
As you know, a wolf's on the loose,
and you are the lambs.

354
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:22,416
So we're taking you into the barn.

355
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,583
You will be escorted
by my colleagues and shepherds:

356
00:23:25,666 --> 00:23:27,083
Helsinki and Stockholm.

357
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:29,500
Let's go, now, quickly!

358
00:23:29,583 --> 00:23:31,708
Everyone up! Come on!

359
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:35,958
Stay here with me.

360
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:38,625
You're my best shield against Gandía.

361
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:40,041
That's it, quickly.

362
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:47,625
<i>Here. This works wonders.</i>

363
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:50,875
<i>It's not too strong, is it?</i>

364
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:52,000
Amanda, right?

365
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:54,916
-Yes.
-Are you OK?

366
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,666
Yes.

367
00:23:58,750 --> 00:23:59,958
Are you sure?

368
00:24:00,958 --> 00:24:02,041
Well...

369
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:04,083
I'm a bit dizzy.

370
00:24:04,541 --> 00:24:07,333
It must have been
those pills Mr. Román gave me.

371
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,500
Hello, how are you?

372
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,000
Fine.

373
00:24:20,541 --> 00:24:21,583
I'm Arturo.

374
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:23,458
Arturo Román.

375
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:26,250
You looked very tense before,

376
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:29,041
asking to go to the bathroom.
I was worried.

377
00:24:29,833 --> 00:24:32,416
It's my nerves. It's tough being in here.

378
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:36,875
With these terrorists,
it'd be tough anywhere. I know.

379
00:24:39,458 --> 00:24:41,833
It was just some anxiety.
I'm OK. Thanks.

380
00:24:41,916 --> 00:24:45,083
We only have each other.
We have to stick together.

381
00:24:45,791 --> 00:24:46,750
Trust me.

382
00:24:47,625 --> 00:24:48,458
Yeah.

383
00:24:53,083 --> 00:24:55,541
If you feel anxious again,

384
00:24:56,708 --> 00:24:58,916
I've got something that might help.

385
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,458
Oh, really? What is it?

386
00:25:04,208 --> 00:25:05,791
Veteran's privileges.

387
00:25:07,625 --> 00:25:08,791
That's everyone.

388
00:25:08,875 --> 00:25:12,500
We've brought you to the library because,
as the saying goes,

389
00:25:12,583 --> 00:25:14,375
knowledge takes up no space.

390
00:25:14,833 --> 00:25:17,375
In this case,
it could also save your lives.

391
00:25:17,458 --> 00:25:20,833
<i>In Search of Lost Time,</i>
for example, by Marcel Proust.

392
00:25:21,125 --> 00:25:24,291
Terrific. Beautiful novel. I'm certain...

393
00:25:24,708 --> 00:25:26,041
that whoever finds it

394
00:25:26,583 --> 00:25:29,000
and hugs it to their chest

395
00:25:29,708 --> 00:25:32,250
will be able to deflect bullets
from an M16.

396
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:37,791
It's a joke. Relax.

397
00:25:38,791 --> 00:25:41,000
We'll be in here for a long time.

398
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:43,625
These are the rules. Number one--

399
00:25:46,375 --> 00:25:48,458
Bogotá, Nairobi, where are you?

400
00:25:50,416 --> 00:25:53,416
5:00 MINUTES EARLIER

401
00:25:54,666 --> 00:25:56,083
Don't move!

402
00:25:56,166 --> 00:25:59,250
Are you all stupid or what?
Lower your weapons.

403
00:26:11,333 --> 00:26:12,541
Are you scared?

404
00:26:12,625 --> 00:26:16,125
There's a madman on the loose
who's armed to the teeth.

405
00:26:17,458 --> 00:26:18,666
I'm scared too.

406
00:26:19,416 --> 00:26:22,250
-Bogotá, are you scared?
-As much as anyone else.

407
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:28,875
Palermo, Helsinki, and Stockholm
are scared as well.

408
00:26:31,291 --> 00:26:33,666
But they're taking hostages
to the library.

409
00:26:35,125 --> 00:26:39,791
Denver and Rio are really damn scared.

410
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:44,000
Because they're after Gandía.

411
00:26:44,833 --> 00:26:45,916
And Gandía...

412
00:26:46,416 --> 00:26:49,791
is the most scared,
but he won't stop until he kills us.

413
00:26:50,333 --> 00:26:51,541
That's fine with me.

414
00:26:52,583 --> 00:26:53,583
"That's fine."

415
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:08,833
Everyone's doing their jobs.

416
00:27:10,166 --> 00:27:13,250
And here you are, scared shitless.

417
00:27:14,125 --> 00:27:15,833
Hiding in a makeshift trench.

418
00:27:15,916 --> 00:27:18,708
-We didn't come here to shoot people.
-I know.

419
00:27:21,375 --> 00:27:25,291
But there's no choice.
This is the easiest place to defend.

420
00:27:25,916 --> 00:27:27,708
That's the only way in,

421
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:31,625
and from here,
any one of us could mow him down.

422
00:27:32,583 --> 00:27:34,916
But what do you see when you enter?

423
00:27:36,416 --> 00:27:38,958
The chicken squadron peering out.

424
00:27:40,541 --> 00:27:43,708
I don't recognize you.

425
00:27:45,541 --> 00:27:47,541
You are workers.

426
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,041
You are welders.

427
00:27:50,958 --> 00:27:53,750
The toughest guys
I've ever met in my life.

428
00:27:53,833 --> 00:27:54,958
My golden boys.

429
00:27:56,166 --> 00:27:57,458
You're not chickens.

430
00:28:00,791 --> 00:28:03,125
You know what else is scary?

431
00:28:05,125 --> 00:28:07,041
Walking home alone at night.

432
00:28:09,041 --> 00:28:11,625
But us women keep doing it.

433
00:28:12,833 --> 00:28:16,458
Take fear by the hand and keep living.

434
00:28:18,833 --> 00:28:21,458
Because you have to live, gentlemen!

435
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:24,041
You have to live to the end!

436
00:28:31,208 --> 00:28:32,583
Fuck, believe me.

437
00:28:33,333 --> 00:28:36,041
You made me come back from the dead
to nag you.

438
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:44,291
What? Aren't you going to give me a hug?

439
00:28:50,541 --> 00:28:52,416
-How are you?
-I don't know.

440
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,000
Pumped full of drugs.

441
00:28:54,083 --> 00:28:55,916
I'm not hearing any music.

442
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,916
-Are we going to work unhappy?
-Music, dammit.

443
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,541
Are we Latinos or Germans?

444
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,416
Nice wheels. Is it a Harley?

445
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,500
Don't start ribbing me now, hey?

446
00:29:05,583 --> 00:29:07,708
How many tons have we melted?

447
00:29:07,791 --> 00:29:09,208
Forty-three and a half.

448
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:12,916
We need to step it up a gear.
I want the furnaces on.

449
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
And two-hour shifts
to get the remaining ingots.

450
00:29:16,083 --> 00:29:17,916
Bring me a sample of the shot.

451
00:29:23,083 --> 00:29:23,958
Let's see.

452
00:29:28,583 --> 00:29:31,416
Turn up the gas pressure
by two kilopascals.

453
00:29:32,166 --> 00:29:34,166
The diameter's a bit big.

454
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:36,916
I want to see you working like always...

455
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,916
with rhythm, with joy.

456
00:29:55,791 --> 00:29:56,916
What's up with you?

457
00:30:00,958 --> 00:30:02,041
What do you mean?

458
00:30:03,083 --> 00:30:03,916
Nothing.

459
00:30:05,875 --> 00:30:08,875
I'll have to say
that ten-foot pole thing again.

460
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:11,750
When I said that, at least...

461
00:30:12,916 --> 00:30:14,125
you flirted with me.

462
00:30:14,708 --> 00:30:15,708
But now...

463
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:18,666
it's like I've got typhus.

464
00:30:22,666 --> 00:30:24,791
I don't wanna take advantage.
You're hurt.

465
00:30:28,958 --> 00:30:29,791
Right.

466
00:30:30,666 --> 00:30:31,708
Well, OK.

467
00:30:32,791 --> 00:30:34,583
We'll wait until I'm better,

468
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:38,041
until we get out of here,
we find my father,

469
00:30:38,125 --> 00:30:39,666
you ask him for my hand...

470
00:30:44,458 --> 00:30:47,291
If the fire's gone out, let me know.

471
00:31:12,541 --> 00:31:14,166
What sort of kiss was that?

472
00:31:18,041 --> 00:31:19,083
Help me up.

473
00:31:43,916 --> 00:31:44,916
Better down here.

474
00:31:45,833 --> 00:31:47,000
Yes.

475
00:31:51,833 --> 00:31:53,250
-Are you OK?
-Yes. You?

476
00:31:53,333 --> 00:31:54,833
-Yes.
<i>-Bogotá, Nairobi,</i>

477
00:31:54,916 --> 00:31:57,000
<i>-location?</i>
-Elevator. We're OK.

478
00:31:57,083 --> 00:31:58,458
And Denver and Rio?

479
00:31:59,708 --> 00:32:01,625
5:00 MINUTES EARLIER

480
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:07,958
-Library clear.
<i>-Copy that.</i>

481
00:32:24,541 --> 00:32:26,375
About the Maserati thing...

482
00:32:26,458 --> 00:32:29,208
-What about it?
-I'd like to say something.

483
00:32:29,291 --> 00:32:31,541
Now? What do you want?

484
00:32:31,625 --> 00:32:35,125
Tokyo may be a Maserati,
but you're hanging off the back.

485
00:32:35,416 --> 00:32:37,208
Like cans on a wedding car.

486
00:32:37,291 --> 00:32:38,500
Yes.

487
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:40,375
Rio.

488
00:32:41,083 --> 00:32:41,916
The office.

489
00:32:42,916 --> 00:32:43,833
Go.

490
00:33:03,125 --> 00:33:04,208
Do you like her?

491
00:33:04,291 --> 00:33:07,291
-What are you talking about?
-The fucking Maserati.

492
00:33:08,458 --> 00:33:11,083
If you wanna take her for a ride,
go ahead.

493
00:33:11,166 --> 00:33:13,458
Can you hear the crap you're saying?

494
00:33:19,416 --> 00:33:23,000
First of all, she feels,
thinks, and decides.

495
00:33:25,125 --> 00:33:28,125
The thing is,
she's messed up about the break-up.

496
00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:32,583
I'll tell you one thing.
Respect a friend's girlfriend.

497
00:33:32,666 --> 00:33:34,541
-Ex-girlfriend.
-Same thing.

498
00:33:34,625 --> 00:33:38,791
Ex or not, a friend's girlfriend
is like a radioactive town.

499
00:33:38,875 --> 00:33:42,500
Even after 20,000 years,
it's still contaminated land.

500
00:33:42,583 --> 00:33:45,541
You don't go there,
even with the ex's permission.

501
00:33:45,625 --> 00:33:47,625
-That's stupid.
-No, it's ethics.

502
00:33:47,708 --> 00:33:49,541
The most sacred kind of ethics.

503
00:33:49,916 --> 00:33:52,625
What were you doing
on the sofa with Stockholm?

504
00:33:53,541 --> 00:33:54,583
We were talking.

505
00:33:56,166 --> 00:33:58,333
Barefoot? Come on, man.

506
00:33:58,708 --> 00:34:02,916
-Well, yes, barefoot. What does it matter?
-It does matter, Rio.

507
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,041
I don't talk to Lisbon
barefoot on the sofa.

508
00:34:06,125 --> 00:34:10,125
It would be fucking weird.
I'd feel uncomfortable. Do you know why?

509
00:34:10,208 --> 00:34:12,208
That's the Professor's territory.

510
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,833
There's your boyfriend.
Want to say anything to him?

511
00:34:17,916 --> 00:34:19,166
Rio! Rio, isn't it?

512
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,333
Rio! Denver!

513
00:34:22,416 --> 00:34:24,625
Help me, please!

514
00:34:24,708 --> 00:34:31,291
I'm trapped! Friends from the gang, help!

515
00:34:37,416 --> 00:34:41,083
That's what 70 centimeters
of reinforced concrete does.

516
00:34:41,791 --> 00:34:45,416
It's like shouting in a submarine
at the bottom of the sea.

517
00:34:54,083 --> 00:34:55,291
Third card:

518
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,583
to draw blood.

519
00:35:01,083 --> 00:35:02,750
I'm going out for a moment.

520
00:35:14,625 --> 00:35:17,625
I was telling her I have PTSD, asshole.

521
00:35:17,708 --> 00:35:19,875
I wasn't stealing your girlfriend.

522
00:35:19,958 --> 00:35:24,041
-Talking to her calms me down.
-Talking to Stockholm calms you down?

523
00:35:24,125 --> 00:35:24,958
Well, yes.

524
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:31,208
She is smart, nice, and she listens.
She empathizes. You can tell her anything.

525
00:35:31,291 --> 00:35:34,833
You can tell me anything too,
but you don't want to.

526
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:46,541
I haven't been able to sleep.

527
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:50,583
Whenever I closed my eyes,
I had nightmares, anxiety,

528
00:35:50,666 --> 00:35:52,625
palpitations, attacks, dude.

529
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:57,000
I've only been able to sleep
knowing she was by my side.

530
00:35:57,958 --> 00:35:59,791
Do you know what I mean?

531
00:36:01,958 --> 00:36:04,583
You sleep with her
and tell me to my face.

532
00:36:05,583 --> 00:36:10,458
I haven't slept with her, Denver.
She was just keeping me company.

533
00:36:15,375 --> 00:36:17,375
Are you my friend or not, damn it?

534
00:36:19,708 --> 00:36:22,541
-I'm your friend.
-Doesn't seem like it.

535
00:36:27,166 --> 00:36:28,625
Jesus fucking Christ!

536
00:36:29,791 --> 00:36:32,458
Your helmet! Your vest!

537
00:36:32,541 --> 00:36:34,041
Put pressure on it!

538
00:36:34,916 --> 00:36:36,208
Denver, hold on!

539
00:36:44,583 --> 00:36:47,083
-Bogotá, Nairobi, location?
<i>-Elevator.</i>

540
00:36:47,166 --> 00:36:49,291
We're OK. And Denver and Rio?

541
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:50,875
Denver, Rio.

542
00:36:52,166 --> 00:36:53,916
-Denver, Rio.
-I'll go.

543
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,166
No, you stay with the hostages.

544
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,916
Come on, Helsinki.

545
00:37:10,125 --> 00:37:12,416
Careful, the bastard's here somewhere.

546
00:37:25,125 --> 00:37:27,791
It was in the elevator
on the first floor.

547
00:37:27,875 --> 00:37:28,958
Received.

548
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:32,708
He may be nearby. We'll stay here.

549
00:37:35,416 --> 00:37:36,583
Come on, big man.

550
00:37:54,125 --> 00:37:55,541
Stay calm. We're here!

551
00:37:58,625 --> 00:38:00,875
-Get up.
-Denver.

552
00:38:01,666 --> 00:38:03,083
Are you OK?

553
00:38:03,166 --> 00:38:04,583
Are you OK?

554
00:38:10,875 --> 00:38:11,833
Are you OK?

555
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,416
Get down!

556
00:38:28,833 --> 00:38:30,500
Motherfucker!

557
00:38:34,458 --> 00:38:35,666
We're taking fire!

558
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:38,375
First floor, elevator.
Reinforcements, now!

559
00:38:39,541 --> 00:38:40,500
Go.

560
00:38:44,541 --> 00:38:45,833
Go.

561
00:40:40,958 --> 00:40:43,666
Third time's the charm, mutt.
