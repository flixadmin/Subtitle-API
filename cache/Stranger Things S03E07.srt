
001
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:14,867
What was that?

002
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,619
<font color="#00FF00">(IN RUSSIAN)</font>
I told them they should have sex.

003
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,581
They have not had sex?

004
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:21,998
No.

005
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:44,559
And why all this?

006
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:48,146
If I just turn the keys,
it's like turning off a car.

007
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:51,274
But then the car still works, does it not?

008
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:52,817
Yes.

009
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:56,362
And do you want the car to still work
or do you want it to explode?

010
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:58,156
I want the car to explode.

011
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:00,366
Good. Then do this.

012
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:04,579
Just make sure you are nowhere near it
when it does. It is not pretty.

013
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:06,372
Turns people into dust.

014
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:08,332
And then...

015
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,334
It's over.

016
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:15,381
And I become an American citizen
and join in the fun, yes?

017
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,721
Who said you had to be an American
to join the fun?

018
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:31,647
It doesn't getmore American 
than <i>this,</i> my friend.

019
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:35,026
Fatty foods, ugly decadence,

020
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:36,944
rigged games...

021
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:48,372
They are rigged, these games?
Yes.

022
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:53,794
They do not look rigged.

023
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,505
That's just it, my dear Alexei.

024
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:59,217
They have been designed
to present the illusion of fairness!

025
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,428
But it's all a scam, a trick,

026
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:05,139
to put your money
in the rich man's pocket.

027
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,767
That, my dear friend, is...

028
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:09,727
<i>America.</i>

029
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:11,687
But, hey...

030
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:14,440
knock yourself out.

031
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:16,609
Where are you going?

032
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:20,154
To get us the closest thing to food
I can find.

033
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:51,573
Look!

034
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:53,075
It's not rigged!

035
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,413
It's not rigged.

036
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:18,142
Traitor.

037
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,008
Keep pressure on it.

038
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:07,691
I'll get you help.

039
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:09,151
I'll get help.

040
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:25,495
Heading to "Big Top."

041
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:27,104
Northeast side of the fair.

042
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:33,284
Vasilev, are you there? Vasilev? Answer!

043
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:17,164
Comrade!

044
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:18,668
Get off me!

045
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:54,955
On the lower level...

046
00:47:57,499 --> 00:47:59,167
We've found the children.

047
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:02,504
They are still in the mall. Lower level.

048
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:05,424
Keep all entrances locked down.

049
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:06,341
I repeat...

050
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:08,385
Keep all entrances locked down.

051
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:44,129
Everyone, get over here.

052
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:45,505
I found them.

053
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:22,209
What the hell?
