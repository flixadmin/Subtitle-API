1
00:01:05,001 --> 00:01:06,044
Bast...

2
00:01:07,045 --> 00:01:08,880
time is running out.

3
00:01:10,048 --> 00:01:12,342
Please allow me to heal my brother
of this illness...

4
00:01:13,134 --> 00:01:15,678
and I will never
question your existence again.

5
00:01:16,513 --> 00:01:18,264
His heart rate is dropping fast.
Where are we?

6
00:01:18,431 --> 00:01:19,641
We are finishing a sequence now.

7
00:01:19,807 --> 00:01:21,392
GRIOT, give me the controls.

8
00:01:21,518 --> 00:01:22,769
As you wish, Princess.

9
00:01:28,775 --> 00:01:30,068
What is the confidence rate?

10
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:31,778
25%.

11
00:01:32,403 --> 00:01:34,364
We'll have to try another way.

12
00:01:34,572 --> 00:01:37,951
King T'Challa's heart rate
has fallen to 31 beats per minute.

13
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,578
Princess, you should go be by his side.

14
00:01:40,745 --> 00:01:43,289
I have to think.
Everyone, get out.

15
00:01:44,624 --> 00:01:45,708
Get out!

16
00:01:51,923 --> 00:01:52,924
What is the confidence rate?

17
00:01:53,007 --> 00:01:54,467
29.1%.

18
00:01:54,676 --> 00:01:55,677
Print it!

19
00:02:00,515 --> 00:02:04,310
Princess, I am aware of the urgency,
but I must warn you...

20
00:02:04,435 --> 00:02:06,271
this synthetic Heart-Shaped Herb...

21
00:02:06,437 --> 00:02:08,648
has a minimal chance of
producing the desired effects.

22
00:02:08,857 --> 00:02:11,943
I don't care! Has to work.

23
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,297
GRIOT.

24
00:02:32,463 --> 00:02:33,464
Yes, Princess?

25
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,758
What's my brother's heart rate?

26
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:45,685
Your brother is with the ancestors.

27
00:02:53,067 --> 00:02:54,152
No.

28
00:02:58,281 --> 00:03:05,205
We give thanks for the gift of King T'Challa.

29
00:03:06,247 --> 00:03:11,002
The Black Panther.

30
00:03:12,212 --> 00:03:15,298
Son of King T'Chaka.

31
00:03:15,882 --> 00:03:16,841
My son.

32
00:03:17,091 --> 00:03:22,430
Descendant of the most revered King Bashenga,

33
00:03:22,931 --> 00:03:25,350
the first Black Panther.

34
00:03:25,767 --> 00:03:27,602
We release you.

35
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,896
Praise the ancestors.

36
00:03:51,042 --> 00:03:54,963
T'Challa, T'Challa, T'Challa

37
00:03:55,964 --> 00:04:00,009
T'Challa, T'Challa, T'Challa

38
00:04:00,969 --> 00:04:04,889
T'Challa, T'Challa, T'Challa

39
00:04:06,057 --> 00:04:09,602
T'Challa, T'Challa, T'Challa

40
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:15,024
T'Challa, T'Challa, T'Challa

41
00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:20,238
T'Challa, T'Challa, T'Challa

42
00:04:21,614 --> 00:04:22,699
T'Challa

43
00:05:50,328 --> 00:05:52,163
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

44
00:07:35,683 --> 00:07:37,352
It is an honor for me...

45
00:07:37,435 --> 00:07:40,104
to invite her majesty, Queen Ramonda...

46
00:07:40,313 --> 00:07:43,691
daughter of Lumumba,
sovereign ruler of the kingdom of Wakanda.

47
00:07:57,413 --> 00:07:59,999
Mr. Chairperson...

48
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:04,587
I believe I speak for
all the member states here...

49
00:08:04,796 --> 00:08:08,591
when I say that
I am deeply disappointed in Wakanda's...

50
00:08:08,675 --> 00:08:13,555
failure to stand by promises to
participate in global efforts...

51
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:17,892
to tackle international challenges,
to share resources...

52
00:08:18,059 --> 00:08:19,561
and full cooperation...

53
00:08:20,103 --> 00:08:21,938
concerning vibranium.

54
00:08:22,105 --> 00:08:29,112
France has information that vibranium can be
used to make weapons of mass destruction.

55
00:08:29,529 --> 00:08:32,991
It does not trigger any known metal detector.

56
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:39,581
It is a threat to global security
and the non-proliferation regime.

57
00:08:39,706 --> 00:08:43,042
I now give the floor to
Her Majesty, Queen Ramonda.

58
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:52,969
It has always been our policy...

59
00:08:53,136 --> 00:08:58,057
to never trade vibranium
under any circumstance.

60
00:08:58,308 --> 00:09:03,104
Not because of the dangerous potential
of vibranium...

61
00:09:03,271 --> 00:09:07,775
but because of
the dangerous potential of you.

62
00:09:20,038 --> 00:09:21,456
I just lost security visuals.

63
00:09:26,002 --> 00:09:28,713
Down on your stomachs right now!

64
00:09:28,838 --> 00:09:30,298
Face to the floor! Go! Go!

65
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:32,717
Where are the vibranium tools?

66
00:09:36,513 --> 00:09:37,514
Who has access?

67
00:09:48,525 --> 00:09:52,946
You perform civility here.

68
00:09:53,404 --> 00:09:55,782
But we know what you whisper...

69
00:09:55,990 --> 00:10:00,245
in your halls of leadership
and in your military facilities.

70
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:07,961
"The King is dead.

71
00:10:09,671 --> 00:10:12,757
"The Black Panther is gone.

72
00:10:14,676 --> 00:10:17,929
"They have lost their protector.

73
00:10:23,768 --> 00:10:27,063
"Now is our time...

74
00:10:28,481 --> 00:10:29,649
"to strike."

75
00:10:56,551 --> 00:10:58,803
Aneka, where is your spear?

76
00:10:59,053 --> 00:11:00,388
Shuri gave me these to try.

77
00:11:03,099 --> 00:11:04,851
You know, I like them better.

78
00:11:04,934 --> 00:11:06,519
Our foremothers gave us the spear...

79
00:11:06,686 --> 00:11:09,397
because it is precise, elegant...

80
00:11:11,149 --> 00:11:12,275
and deadly.

81
00:11:15,236 --> 00:11:17,405
It will not change under my watch.

82
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:20,825
Yes, General.

83
00:11:21,492 --> 00:11:23,286
I told you not to bring them.

84
00:11:26,206 --> 00:11:30,919
Last night there was another attack
on one of our outreach facilities.

85
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,423
Proof of the involvement of a member state...

86
00:11:35,673 --> 00:11:39,677
is being uploaded to your mobile devices
as we speak.

87
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:43,848
And as for the identity of the attackers...

88
00:11:56,361 --> 00:11:58,029
Kneel!

89
00:12:01,533 --> 00:12:02,784
You're welcome.

90
00:12:03,576 --> 00:12:09,541
Let our gracious response to this incursion
be an olive branch.

91
00:12:11,376 --> 00:12:14,462
Further attempts on our resources...

92
00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:17,715
will be considered an act of aggression...

93
00:12:17,882 --> 00:12:21,636
and met with a much steeper response.

94
00:12:23,346 --> 00:12:25,807
We mourn the loss of our king.

95
00:12:26,683 --> 00:12:31,396
But do not think for a second
that Wakanda has lost her ability...

96
00:12:31,479 --> 00:12:34,107
to protect our resources.

97
00:12:34,607 --> 00:12:38,236
We are aware
of the ongoing efforts by some...

98
00:12:38,444 --> 00:12:41,739
to find vibranium outside of Wakanda...

99
00:12:41,906 --> 00:12:46,035
and wish you the best of luck.

100
00:12:50,582 --> 00:12:54,252
This is Rotor 625
requesting clearance to land.

101
00:12:58,464 --> 00:12:59,465
All right. Meet you down there.

102
00:12:59,549 --> 00:13:00,633
Yeah.

103
00:13:03,136 --> 00:13:04,220
Hey!

104
00:13:04,929 --> 00:13:06,222
I thought you retired!

105
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:07,432
I thought I had too.

106
00:13:07,557 --> 00:13:10,935
They said that machine had a one
in a billion chance of finding vibranium.

107
00:13:11,019 --> 00:13:12,270
Oh, less than that.

108
00:13:34,334 --> 00:13:35,335
Here we go.

109
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:39,339
Cabin pressure is stable
at negative one P-S-I.

110
00:13:44,761 --> 00:13:46,095
At 800 feet...

111
00:13:46,262 --> 00:13:48,223
passing through thermocline.

112
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:50,016
All my life supports in the green.

113
00:13:52,268 --> 00:13:53,228
Copy you.

114
00:14:02,529 --> 00:14:03,988
We've touched down.

115
00:14:11,538 --> 00:14:15,083
Perfect. So, Salazar,
you are near the site right there.

116
00:14:16,376 --> 00:14:18,503
Yeah, it's astonishing.

117
00:14:20,505 --> 00:14:23,299
The drill seemed to make contact
with a metallic substance.

118
00:14:24,259 --> 00:14:26,261
Whatever it is, it's solid.

119
00:14:26,594 --> 00:14:28,972
I've never seen a drill bit
chewed up like this before.

120
00:14:32,517 --> 00:14:33,601
I'll be.

121
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:35,854
Vibranium in the ocean.

122
00:14:36,062 --> 00:14:37,730
Let's go ahead
and get the detector out of there...

123
00:14:37,897 --> 00:14:39,816
since it's the only one we've got.

124
00:14:40,775 --> 00:14:43,111
Heading towards the vibranium detector.

125
00:14:55,123 --> 00:14:56,249
Okay, Salazar, we just went dark.

126
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:57,959
Yeah. The rig lost power.

127
00:14:58,585 --> 00:15:00,420
Copy that. I'm gonna fix it up here.

128
00:15:16,311 --> 00:15:17,353
What the hell was that?

129
00:15:31,201 --> 00:15:32,660
Jackson...

130
00:15:32,827 --> 00:15:34,579
tell me you're seeing this?

131
00:15:34,871 --> 00:15:36,664
Hang on. Salazar's heart rate.

132
00:15:36,873 --> 00:15:39,042
Hey, Salazar, can you give me a visual?

133
00:15:40,877 --> 00:15:43,004
It's a phantom jellyfish.

134
00:15:43,213 --> 00:15:44,589
I've never seen one this color.

135
00:15:45,381 --> 00:15:46,883
Emergency dive team, stand by.

136
00:15:47,091 --> 00:15:49,802
Salazar, we just lost Jackson's vitals.

137
00:15:49,969 --> 00:15:51,137
Can you see him?

138
00:15:59,103 --> 00:16:00,939
No. He's gone.

139
00:16:01,189 --> 00:16:03,066
Can you clarify?
What do you mean by, "He's gone"?

140
00:16:04,984 --> 00:16:06,236
Salazar, do you copy?

141
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,780
Salazar?

142
00:16:12,242 --> 00:16:14,619
Smitty, we got a situation out here.

143
00:16:26,464 --> 00:16:27,549
What's that sound?

144
00:16:27,924 --> 00:16:29,717
West, you got a visual on
what's making that sound?

145
00:16:36,474 --> 00:16:37,725
West, how copy, over?

146
00:16:41,104 --> 00:16:42,272
West, you got a visual?

147
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:02,834
It's some kind of sonic attack.

148
00:17:03,084 --> 00:17:04,794
Hey, Smitty, earplugs.

149
00:17:11,968 --> 00:17:13,094
We are under attack.

150
00:17:13,261 --> 00:17:15,096
You need to send in
a strike team immediately.

151
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:18,141
Copy.
Mayday, mayday, this is Rotor 625.

152
00:17:18,224 --> 00:17:19,684
We are requesting assistance immediately.

153
00:17:19,893 --> 00:17:20,894
It's the Wakandans.

154
00:17:23,354 --> 00:17:24,439
It has to be.

155
00:17:40,288 --> 00:17:41,289
Henderson.

156
00:17:41,456 --> 00:17:42,832
Smitty, we gotta go.

157
00:17:43,249 --> 00:17:44,292
Henderson!

158
00:17:45,293 --> 00:17:46,377
Let's go.

159
00:17:49,214 --> 00:17:50,215
What's going on?

160
00:17:50,965 --> 00:17:51,966
Get off the edge.

161
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:09,692
Go!

162
00:18:30,421 --> 00:18:31,422
Go, go, go!

163
00:18:38,805 --> 00:18:39,848
Now! Go!

164
00:18:40,098 --> 00:18:41,599
Spin! Spin them off!

165
00:18:43,309 --> 00:18:44,561
Okay. They're gone!

166
00:18:44,769 --> 00:18:45,812
Oh, my God!

167
00:19:05,456 --> 00:19:06,457
Just get us out.

168
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:07,834
We're good.

169
00:19:08,293 --> 00:19:09,252
We're good.

170
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,670
Where is the strike team?

171
00:19:10,837 --> 00:19:12,881
It wasn't the Wakandans. They were blue.

172
00:19:13,047 --> 00:19:14,174
Everyone is dead...

173
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:17,927
Shit.
What is going on?

174
00:19:18,094 --> 00:19:19,137
We're getting pulled backwards.

175
00:19:20,638 --> 00:19:21,639
Oh, my God.

176
00:19:28,062 --> 00:19:29,189
Oh, God! Hang on!

177
00:20:04,224 --> 00:20:05,975
Queen Ramonda of the nation of Wakanda...

178
00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:08,353
gave an electrifying speech
at the UN yesterday...

179
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,314
while members of her military
escorted captive mercenaries...

180
00:20:11,523 --> 00:20:13,191
onto the floor of the UN.

181
00:20:13,316 --> 00:20:14,984
A year has passed since Queen Ramonda...

182
00:20:15,193 --> 00:20:17,111
was reinstated as ruler of Wakanda...

183
00:20:17,278 --> 00:20:20,698
after King T'Challa's sudden death
from an undisclosed illness last year.

184
00:20:20,907 --> 00:20:22,867
All eyes are on the tiny, powerful nation...

185
00:20:23,076 --> 00:20:25,703
as it finds itself increasingly isolated...

186
00:20:25,828 --> 00:20:27,580
My Queen.

187
00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:29,999
Approaching the river border.

188
00:20:36,714 --> 00:20:38,341
We are home.

189
00:21:28,141 --> 00:21:29,225
Princess.

190
00:21:29,392 --> 00:21:31,811
Just a moment.
I'm in the middle of something.

191
00:21:31,978 --> 00:21:33,313
I understand, Princess, however...

192
00:21:33,479 --> 00:21:35,231
You're disrupting my train of thought.

193
00:21:38,735 --> 00:21:39,777
Shuri.

194
00:21:40,236 --> 00:21:41,237
Mother.

195
00:21:41,404 --> 00:21:44,282
I was trying to tell you.
The Queen is here.

196
00:21:44,741 --> 00:21:46,451
-Thank you.
-That thing unnerves me.

197
00:21:47,035 --> 00:21:50,413
I think that one day artificial intelligence
is going to kill us all.

198
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:55,251
My AI isn't like the movies, Mother.
It does exactly what I tell it to do.

199
00:21:55,418 --> 00:21:57,754
Yeah, if only children were the same.

200
00:21:58,963 --> 00:22:01,799
Everyone seems to be working diligently.

201
00:22:02,425 --> 00:22:05,929
Yes. Rapid emergency response task.

202
00:22:06,554 --> 00:22:07,847
There could be any number of...

203
00:22:07,972 --> 00:22:11,226
unknown threats on the horizon,
and they're creating solutions.

204
00:22:12,268 --> 00:22:14,270
Oh, what is this?

205
00:22:14,479 --> 00:22:16,105
Exo Suits for our army.

206
00:22:16,314 --> 00:22:20,818
It grants the user super-human strength,
speed, and durability.

207
00:22:20,985 --> 00:22:23,530
But, as always, Okoye had notes.

208
00:22:23,738 --> 00:22:24,739
What were her notes?

209
00:22:24,989 --> 00:22:26,241
She hates them.

210
00:22:31,746 --> 00:22:33,998
What about recreating the Heart-Shaped Herb?

211
00:22:34,123 --> 00:22:36,125
Have you made any progress on that?

212
00:22:36,251 --> 00:22:37,460
Excuse me, Princess.

213
00:22:37,669 --> 00:22:40,672
Nakia, daughter of Yaa,
is trying to reach you again.

214
00:22:40,964 --> 00:22:41,881
Maybe you should...

215
00:22:42,131 --> 00:22:43,716
Maybe you should
continue your calculations...

216
00:22:43,925 --> 00:22:44,926
as I instructed.

217
00:22:45,176 --> 00:22:46,761
As you wish, Princess.

218
00:22:48,096 --> 00:22:52,642
We do not need the Herb, Mother.
We need new technology.

219
00:22:52,767 --> 00:22:53,977
What of the Black Panther?

220
00:22:57,313 --> 00:23:00,817
The mantle has unified our nation
for centuries.

221
00:23:00,984 --> 00:23:03,152
The Black Panther is a relic, Mother.

222
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:05,697
I wasn't trying to save the mantle
with the Herb...

223
00:23:05,864 --> 00:23:08,032
I was trying to save my brother.

224
00:23:10,118 --> 00:23:11,160
Oh, Shuri.

225
00:23:25,175 --> 00:23:26,509
Do you know what day it is?

226
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,469
Tuesday.

227
00:23:29,345 --> 00:23:30,805
The date, child.

228
00:23:36,978 --> 00:23:38,396
Brother's passing.

229
00:23:38,813 --> 00:23:40,481
One year ago today.

230
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,284
Have you planned anything?

231
00:23:51,409 --> 00:23:55,371
Yes. It involves you
taking your mother for a drive.

232
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:57,373
-Right now?
-Right now.

233
00:23:57,999 --> 00:23:59,626
And you can leave your Kimoyo Beads here.

234
00:23:59,709 --> 00:24:00,710
-Mother.
-No, no.

235
00:24:00,877 --> 00:24:02,962
You won't need them where we are going.

236
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,637
And the other two. Yes.

237
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:38,248
You need to sit here with me.
And with yourself.

238
00:24:38,456 --> 00:24:40,917
It is the only way
you are going to heal...

239
00:24:41,042 --> 00:24:43,253
from the wound caused
by T'Challa's death.

240
00:24:43,378 --> 00:24:44,671
I'm fine, Mother.

241
00:24:46,214 --> 00:24:48,174
You don't have to worry about me.

242
00:24:49,384 --> 00:24:52,929
He's gone, but I'm moving forward.

243
00:24:53,137 --> 00:24:57,892
T'Challa is dead,
but that doesn't mean he is gone.

244
00:24:58,351 --> 00:25:01,187
When that illness
took your brother from us...

245
00:25:01,396 --> 00:25:05,942
I had to lead a wounded nation
and a broken world.

246
00:25:06,067 --> 00:25:08,778
But I still took time in the bush.

247
00:25:08,987 --> 00:25:12,240
I wandered until I found water.

248
00:25:12,407 --> 00:25:13,700
And I sat.

249
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:17,036
Then I did this ritual...

250
00:25:17,203 --> 00:25:19,664
that I am about to show you now.

251
00:25:22,125 --> 00:25:26,337
I found your brother in the breeze...

252
00:25:27,714 --> 00:25:31,092
pushing me gently, but firm.

253
00:25:32,093 --> 00:25:34,262
Like his hand on my shoulder.

254
00:25:36,681 --> 00:25:38,057
It took some time...

255
00:25:39,475 --> 00:25:41,477
but he was there.

256
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:49,110
He wasn't there, Mother.

257
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,280
The presence that you felt...

258
00:25:52,363 --> 00:25:54,365
was just a construct of your mind.

259
00:25:56,451 --> 00:26:00,288
Brought on so you could feel
some comfort or joy.

260
00:26:00,788 --> 00:26:02,415
That's all.

261
00:26:09,255 --> 00:26:12,091
What construct
does your mind create...

262
00:26:12,258 --> 00:26:14,219
when you think of your brother?

263
00:26:15,178 --> 00:26:17,222
Does it offer you comfort?

264
00:26:18,556 --> 00:26:20,016
Or torment?

265
00:26:33,613 --> 00:26:34,697
Come, child.

266
00:26:46,417 --> 00:26:47,502
How did you get this?

267
00:26:47,585 --> 00:26:48,753
What does it matter?

268
00:26:49,546 --> 00:26:51,381
What does this have to do with your ritual?

269
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:54,843
Burning of the funeral garments...

270
00:26:55,009 --> 00:26:57,345
marks the end
of the mourning period...

271
00:26:57,512 --> 00:27:00,306
and the beginning
of a new relationship...

272
00:27:00,515 --> 00:27:02,767
with our loved ones that have passed on...

273
00:27:03,184 --> 00:27:04,853
I'm not doing this, Mother.

274
00:27:06,187 --> 00:27:07,522
If I sit...

275
00:27:07,689 --> 00:27:10,275
and think about my brother
for too long...

276
00:27:11,734 --> 00:27:14,612
it won't be these clothes I'll burn.

277
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,323
It will be the world...

278
00:27:18,825 --> 00:27:20,285
and everyone in it.

279
00:27:21,494 --> 00:27:22,662
Shuri...

280
00:27:27,125 --> 00:27:30,044
Shuri, there's something
that I need to tell you...

281
00:27:30,587 --> 00:27:31,880
about your brother.

282
00:27:36,384 --> 00:27:37,385
Mother, wait!

283
00:27:37,969 --> 00:27:39,387
What are you doing?

284
00:28:04,662 --> 00:28:06,539
This better not be a part of your ritual.

285
00:28:06,748 --> 00:28:07,999
It isn't.

286
00:28:09,667 --> 00:28:11,294
Stop! Right there!

287
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,839
Who are you?
And how did you get in here?

288
00:28:16,341 --> 00:28:17,884
This place is amazing.

289
00:28:18,801 --> 00:28:20,887
The air is pristine.

290
00:28:22,347 --> 00:28:23,348
And the water...

291
00:28:24,891 --> 00:28:26,935
My mother told stories
about a place like this.

292
00:28:27,352 --> 00:28:30,480
A protected land with people
that never have to leave.

293
00:28:30,688 --> 00:28:32,982
That never have to change who they were.

294
00:28:34,609 --> 00:28:37,570
What reason do you have
to reveal your secret to the world?

295
00:28:37,779 --> 00:28:40,573
I am not a woman
who enjoys repeating herself.

296
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,617
Who are you?

297
00:28:42,784 --> 00:28:44,035
I have many names.

298
00:28:44,619 --> 00:28:47,705
My people call me K'uk'ulkan...

299
00:28:50,583 --> 00:28:52,377
but my enemies call me Namor.

300
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:58,383
The American military detected vibranium
under my nation's domain.

301
00:28:59,384 --> 00:29:02,929
I was able to
stop them from minin' it...

302
00:29:03,847 --> 00:29:06,975
but we need Wakanda's help
to prevent it from happenin' again.

303
00:29:08,101 --> 00:29:11,062
They use a machine
designed by an American scientist.

304
00:29:11,229 --> 00:29:13,690
Vibranium only exists here.

305
00:29:13,815 --> 00:29:15,233
In Wakanda.

306
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,734
Mother, he's covered in it.

307
00:29:20,697 --> 00:29:24,367
Your son exposed the power of vibranium
to the world.

308
00:29:24,993 --> 00:29:28,788
In response, other nations have begun
searching the planet for it.

309
00:29:28,997 --> 00:29:32,292
His choice has compromised us.

310
00:29:33,168 --> 00:29:36,880
I think Wakanda could find the scientist
and bring them to me?

311
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:41,593
It is only fair that Wakanda
helps to resolve our dilemma.

312
00:29:41,801 --> 00:29:47,056
You do not sneak into my country
and tell me what is fair.

313
00:29:48,558 --> 00:29:51,644
I have more soldiers
than this land has blades of grass.

314
00:29:52,353 --> 00:29:55,190
And they have incomparable strength.

315
00:29:55,607 --> 00:29:58,735
I would hate to come back
under different circumstances.

316
00:30:04,741 --> 00:30:07,202
When you have the scientist,
blow into this...

317
00:30:07,452 --> 00:30:08,786
place it in the ocean.

318
00:30:09,162 --> 00:30:11,164
I'll be there shortly afterwards.

319
00:30:14,751 --> 00:30:16,002
For your own sake...

320
00:30:16,419 --> 00:30:20,173
don't mention anything about me
to anyone outside of Wakanda.

321
00:30:28,973 --> 00:30:30,850
Did you see the wings on his ankles?

322
00:30:47,325 --> 00:30:48,409
How did he do that?

323
00:30:49,285 --> 00:30:50,828
We must convene the Council.

324
00:30:52,914 --> 00:30:56,292
Heaven Scrapers had no evidence
of any activity at all.

325
00:30:58,378 --> 00:31:02,298
Oh, the river border has been breached?

326
00:31:03,258 --> 00:31:04,759
If my soldiers were present...

327
00:31:05,093 --> 00:31:07,345
this "fish man"...

328
00:31:07,512 --> 00:31:09,222
would be bound before us
as we speak.

329
00:31:09,472 --> 00:31:11,683
If your muscle brains were present...

330
00:31:11,891 --> 00:31:14,978
they would still be there
choking on their fuzzy adornments.

331
00:31:15,144 --> 00:31:16,312
You bald-headed demon...

332
00:31:16,479 --> 00:31:18,273
Show some respect, you two.

333
00:31:18,439 --> 00:31:19,440
Respect?

334
00:31:19,649 --> 00:31:22,068
These men should be
ashamed to show their faces!

335
00:31:22,277 --> 00:31:23,194
Watch your tone, Jabari!

336
00:31:36,624 --> 00:31:38,293
As I was saying...

337
00:31:38,459 --> 00:31:41,129
there was no aerial surveillance
footage of him.

338
00:31:41,296 --> 00:31:42,589
And nothing on the radar as well.

339
00:31:42,755 --> 00:31:46,259
So, he swam underwater
for 100 kilometers.

340
00:31:46,426 --> 00:31:50,221
He was not alone.
And claims to command a massive army.

341
00:31:50,346 --> 00:31:54,684
He wants us to deliver
one American scientist?

342
00:31:54,851 --> 00:31:55,852
So he can kill them?

343
00:31:55,977 --> 00:31:56,978
Do it.

344
00:31:59,314 --> 00:32:02,859
We never had to face an enemy
with access to vibranium before.

345
00:32:03,776 --> 00:32:05,695
And we have no Black Panther to protect us.

346
00:32:05,862 --> 00:32:10,200
That is because this wise Council
allowed Killmonger to take the throne...

347
00:32:10,408 --> 00:32:12,202
and burn up all of
your precious Heart-Shaped Herb.

348
00:32:12,452 --> 00:32:14,913
M'Baku, what would you have us do?

349
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:17,415
We should find the fish man and kill him.

350
00:32:18,791 --> 00:32:22,212
If we do what he is asking for now...

351
00:32:22,378 --> 00:32:26,674
what is to stop him from coming back
and asking for more?

352
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:37,101
As you were.

353
00:32:38,895 --> 00:32:43,066
Is it just me,
or does this keep getting uglier?

354
00:32:43,316 --> 00:32:44,317
It's you.

355
00:32:45,193 --> 00:32:47,111
-So, does it work?
-Yes.

356
00:32:47,278 --> 00:32:50,949
This thing can detect
the altered frequency of vibranium...

357
00:32:51,115 --> 00:32:56,079
through water, stones, even heavy metals.
Whoever built this is brilliant.

358
00:32:56,496 --> 00:32:57,830
Come, look.

359
00:32:58,498 --> 00:33:01,042
Some are custom parts
and others look like...

360
00:33:01,209 --> 00:33:03,002
they gathered it from a junkyard.

361
00:33:03,127 --> 00:33:05,755
I am still struggling to believe...

362
00:33:06,005 --> 00:33:08,466
that vibranium exists
outside of Wakanda.

363
00:33:08,675 --> 00:33:10,927
Perhaps there was
more than one meteorite.

364
00:33:11,094 --> 00:33:13,888
Our planet is covered of mostly water,
so it's reasonable...

365
00:33:14,055 --> 00:33:16,099
that the other one just landed there.

366
00:33:16,266 --> 00:33:18,351
This changes everything that we know.

367
00:33:18,518 --> 00:33:21,938
The Great Mound.
All of the legends and fables.

368
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:24,566
Those stories are seared in my mind.

369
00:33:24,774 --> 00:33:26,526
That sounds very painful.

370
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,780
So we have to find this scientist after all.

371
00:33:32,365 --> 00:33:33,533
I do have an idea.

372
00:33:34,993 --> 00:33:36,244
I'm going to need the princess.

373
00:33:36,411 --> 00:33:38,371
Out of the question.

374
00:33:38,538 --> 00:33:40,623
She is in no state to be in the field.

375
00:33:40,707 --> 00:33:42,083
My Queen,

376
00:33:43,126 --> 00:33:45,628
it may do her some good to get out.

377
00:33:46,087 --> 00:33:48,756
It might just be exactly what she needs.

378
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:53,344
Besides, I can do this American operation
with my eyes closed.

379
00:33:53,553 --> 00:33:56,764
It's not the Americans
that I'm worried about.

380
00:33:56,931 --> 00:33:58,349
This Namor...

381
00:33:58,766 --> 00:34:00,643
he snuck past our defenses.

382
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:02,729
That will never happen again.

383
00:34:02,937 --> 00:34:04,439
He was not alone.

384
00:34:05,273 --> 00:34:06,482
She'll be with me.

385
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:08,610
So...

386
00:34:09,611 --> 00:34:10,695
when are we leavin'...

387
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,906
so I can see my favorite colonizer?

388
00:34:42,101 --> 00:34:43,144
Come on.

389
00:34:45,063 --> 00:34:46,564
Yeah, I got it.

390
00:34:47,482 --> 00:34:48,858
I got it.

391
00:34:51,069 --> 00:34:52,362
Will you slow down?

392
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:00,703
You didn't think to call?

393
00:35:00,787 --> 00:35:02,789
Now, why would I have your number?

394
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:08,002
We are looking for the scientist
who built the vibranium detector.

395
00:35:08,294 --> 00:35:09,671
So it was you guys in the Atlantic?

396
00:35:10,713 --> 00:35:12,298
Come on. Mining ship.

397
00:35:12,465 --> 00:35:13,800
Lot of casualties.

398
00:35:14,425 --> 00:35:15,426
What happened?

399
00:35:15,635 --> 00:35:16,678
Seriously?

400
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:21,558
It was a joint operation.
Us and the SEALs.

401
00:35:21,724 --> 00:35:24,644
Thirty of their top guys,
two of our best officers...

402
00:35:24,853 --> 00:35:25,854
friends of mine.

403
00:35:26,354 --> 00:35:27,355
Gone.

404
00:35:27,522 --> 00:35:28,565
Just like that.

405
00:35:29,315 --> 00:35:30,984
You throw in the fact that
they were tracking vibranium...

406
00:35:31,109 --> 00:35:33,862
I can assure you
Wakanda had nothing to do with this.

407
00:35:34,779 --> 00:35:35,864
So who was it?

408
00:35:37,365 --> 00:35:39,242
God, look, the way that
this is supposed to work...

409
00:35:39,409 --> 00:35:41,452
is that I give you information
and you reciprocate.

410
00:35:41,578 --> 00:35:44,330
For our own safety,
we cannot tell you.

411
00:35:44,455 --> 00:35:46,541
It's imperative that
we get to the scientist...

412
00:35:46,666 --> 00:35:48,209
before anything else happens.

413
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,712
You owe me, Ross.

414
00:35:50,795 --> 00:35:52,463
You owe my brother.

415
00:35:56,217 --> 00:35:57,218
Okay, look.

416
00:35:58,052 --> 00:36:00,263
There are agents
who have been sentenced to death...

417
00:36:00,471 --> 00:36:02,557
for less than I'm about to give you now.

418
00:36:02,765 --> 00:36:04,017
And we got a new director.

419
00:36:04,642 --> 00:36:06,060
She's watching me like a hawk.

420
00:36:06,227 --> 00:36:08,771
We will be very, very careful.

421
00:36:08,897 --> 00:36:10,899
Not just careful, you gotta be fast.

422
00:36:11,149 --> 00:36:12,650
The US needs another machine...

423
00:36:12,734 --> 00:36:14,319
and this kid is the only person
in the world...

424
00:36:14,444 --> 00:36:15,445
who knows how to build one.

425
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:16,654
So they're comin' for her.

426
00:36:16,738 --> 00:36:17,780
A kid?

427
00:36:28,082 --> 00:36:29,083
Hey.

428
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:30,293
You forgot to Venmo me.

429
00:36:30,376 --> 00:36:33,421
It slipped my mind.
It's eight hundred, right?

430
00:36:33,505 --> 00:36:36,466
Eight hundred was yesterday's price.
It's a band today.

431
00:36:36,633 --> 00:36:38,134
That's predatory.

432
00:36:39,594 --> 00:36:41,179
I built the whole robotic hand.

433
00:36:41,387 --> 00:36:43,848
You just corrected the grip algorithm.

434
00:36:43,932 --> 00:36:45,350
And what grade did you get?

435
00:36:51,856 --> 00:36:52,857
Thanks.

436
00:36:55,818 --> 00:36:56,903
Is that an iPhone I see?

437
00:36:57,111 --> 00:36:58,112
Primitive.

438
00:36:59,572 --> 00:37:00,615
My Queen.

439
00:37:01,658 --> 00:37:03,326
We have located the scientist.

440
00:37:03,618 --> 00:37:07,080
She is in the American equivalent
of a Wakandan village school.

441
00:37:07,247 --> 00:37:08,456
A school?

442
00:37:08,957 --> 00:37:11,292
Please tell me it is a professor.

443
00:37:11,459 --> 00:37:13,253
It's a student, Mother.

444
00:37:13,419 --> 00:37:14,963
We can't give her to Namor.

445
00:37:15,755 --> 00:37:18,341
Bring this student back to Wakanda.

446
00:37:20,009 --> 00:37:21,469
Yes, my Queen.

447
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:24,973
I've got it from here.

448
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,475
Wait. Maybe I should speak with her.

449
00:37:27,684 --> 00:37:28,893
It will be more discreet.

450
00:37:30,186 --> 00:37:31,312
I can be discreet.

451
00:37:35,024 --> 00:37:36,025
What?

452
00:37:36,484 --> 00:37:37,569
-Nothing.
-Is it the makeup?

453
00:37:37,777 --> 00:37:38,778
No.

454
00:37:38,945 --> 00:37:41,030
-It's the wrong shade, isn't it?
-It's the right shade.

455
00:37:41,239 --> 00:37:42,782
Fenty 440. You look good.

456
00:37:44,367 --> 00:37:46,452
I can blend in as a student.

457
00:37:47,537 --> 00:37:48,538
I can do this.

458
00:37:52,417 --> 00:37:53,793
-You get five minutes.
-Yes!

459
00:38:06,181 --> 00:38:07,182
Yo!

460
00:38:07,307 --> 00:38:08,391
Riri Williams?

461
00:38:11,769 --> 00:38:14,355
Yo, I don't do drop-bys no more.
You gotta go to the website.

462
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,817
It's an encrypted file.

463
00:38:18,026 --> 00:38:19,194
I wanted to airdrop it.

464
00:38:20,445 --> 00:38:21,571
You the...

465
00:38:24,115 --> 00:38:25,783
You're Princess Shuri.

466
00:38:27,285 --> 00:38:28,995
What the hell are you doing here?

467
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,705
Oh, shit, am I getting recruited?

468
00:38:32,457 --> 00:38:33,458
No.

469
00:38:34,125 --> 00:38:37,504
I'm here about the vibranium detector
that you built for the CIA.

470
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,800
I ain't built no detector for no CIA.
I made that for my metallurgy class.

471
00:38:42,967 --> 00:38:44,928
-A school project?
-Yeah.

472
00:38:45,428 --> 00:38:47,138
My professor said I'd never be able to do it.

473
00:38:48,765 --> 00:38:50,892
To be young, gifted, and Black though, right?

474
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:56,189
Y'all probably don't say that in Wakanda.

475
00:38:58,441 --> 00:38:59,442
How old are you?

476
00:39:00,485 --> 00:39:01,736
Nineteen.

477
00:39:02,237 --> 00:39:06,032
Brilliance at a young age
is not always accepted by the elders.

478
00:39:07,492 --> 00:39:08,993
How long did it take you?

479
00:39:09,202 --> 00:39:10,286
Couple months.

480
00:39:10,495 --> 00:39:12,038
-Couple months?
-The hardest part was...

481
00:39:12,205 --> 00:39:14,082
finding big enough mylar sheets
to cover the...

482
00:39:15,875 --> 00:39:17,293
Wait, did I piss off Wakanda?

483
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,461
Not just us.

484
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:20,547
This place is no longer safe for you.

485
00:39:21,339 --> 00:39:23,883
Gather your things and come with me.
Right now.

486
00:39:24,717 --> 00:39:27,679
I got Differential Equations class in,
like, 15 minutes.

487
00:39:30,306 --> 00:39:31,307
Okay.

488
00:39:32,392 --> 00:39:33,601
Okay.

489
00:39:33,768 --> 00:39:35,979
You wait right here.

490
00:39:36,813 --> 00:39:39,440
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
I'm just gonna...

491
00:39:42,944 --> 00:39:44,529
I had it under control.

492
00:39:45,405 --> 00:39:47,991
I said five minutes.
I gave you six.

493
00:39:48,157 --> 00:39:49,784
Get out. Get out of my dorm.

494
00:39:50,493 --> 00:39:51,578
Get out!

495
00:39:51,744 --> 00:39:52,745
Hey.

496
00:39:52,954 --> 00:39:56,791
I'm warning you!
Do not take another step toward me!

497
00:39:56,875 --> 00:39:58,960
See how they teach the children
to treat their guests?

498
00:40:04,591 --> 00:40:05,925
You brought a spear in here?

499
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:08,344
You brought a spear in here.

500
00:40:09,179 --> 00:40:10,263
I like her.

501
00:40:10,722 --> 00:40:13,057
Hey, hey, hey. Put it down, put it...

502
00:40:13,224 --> 00:40:14,601
You'll hurt yourself. Come on.

503
00:40:15,268 --> 00:40:16,811
It's all right, Princess.

504
00:40:16,978 --> 00:40:18,354
Small, small girl.

505
00:40:19,439 --> 00:40:22,317
I am going to give you two options.

506
00:40:22,525 --> 00:40:24,694
You can come to Wakanda...

507
00:40:24,861 --> 00:40:27,113
conscious or unconscious.

508
00:40:27,947 --> 00:40:30,658
You need to be conscious
of the way that you look.

509
00:40:30,867 --> 00:40:32,869
Walking round here,
all that ash on your head.

510
00:40:34,704 --> 00:40:36,748
-Oh, it's funny?
-No, it's not.

511
00:40:37,498 --> 00:40:39,375
-I told you!
-You look good.

512
00:40:39,501 --> 00:40:40,919
Calm down. We'll leave, okay?

513
00:40:41,628 --> 00:40:45,757
And she can deal with that merman
with the winged ankles...

514
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,843
who wants to kill her
all by herself.

515
00:40:48,927 --> 00:40:51,095
-You got this.
-With your heater.

516
00:40:51,262 --> 00:40:52,430
Come on. Let's go.

517
00:40:53,097 --> 00:40:54,182
What?

518
00:41:01,523 --> 00:41:03,233
What exactly is this place?

519
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,902
I fixed a few trucks
for the head of sanitation.

520
00:41:06,694 --> 00:41:10,532
He lets me work out of this garage
in exchange.

521
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:12,617
I just have to grab my work laptop.

522
00:41:15,286 --> 00:41:18,081
Please don't touch anything.

523
00:41:18,164 --> 00:41:20,333
You don't have to worry about that.

524
00:41:20,542 --> 00:41:24,212
It may not look like much,
but it's my life's work in here.

525
00:41:25,255 --> 00:41:28,591
So, the design for the machine
is on that laptop?

526
00:41:28,758 --> 00:41:29,759
Yeah.

527
00:41:29,968 --> 00:41:32,804
And you just leave it on a desk
in a car garage?

528
00:41:32,971 --> 00:41:35,932
I got 2065-byte encryption
on that thing.

529
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:39,227
That's impressive.
Ever locked yourself out?

530
00:41:39,435 --> 00:41:41,354
Took me the whole semester to get back in.

531
00:41:41,521 --> 00:41:43,565
Had to build a functional quantum computer...

532
00:41:43,773 --> 00:41:45,650
just to crack my own encryption.

533
00:41:45,859 --> 00:41:48,194
What is it you're building here?
Is it Stark Tech?

534
00:41:48,444 --> 00:41:50,238
I said don't touch anything.

535
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:52,949
Princess, American law enforcement
has arrived at your location.

536
00:41:53,157 --> 00:41:54,534
-Shit.
-Who was that?

537
00:41:54,909 --> 00:41:55,910
My AI.

538
00:41:57,579 --> 00:41:58,997
They are surrounding us.

539
00:42:02,959 --> 00:42:05,712
I thought you said a merman was after me.

540
00:42:05,837 --> 00:42:06,880
That's the feds.

541
00:42:20,268 --> 00:42:22,770
I do not need this shit right now!

542
00:42:22,854 --> 00:42:25,023
I swear to God, I was doing so well!

543
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:27,859
Goin' to class on time.
I must be dumb as hell.

544
00:42:28,067 --> 00:42:30,653
Real dumb thinking that
the Princess of Wakanda...

545
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:33,990
is gonna show up at my doorstep
and then shit about to pop off.

546
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:37,827
I think that I'm actually gonna
take my chances with this merman...

547
00:42:38,036 --> 00:42:41,581
because at least he never
brought the FBI to my garage!

548
00:42:41,789 --> 00:42:45,126
Hey. Namor sank an entire ship
of CIA operatives...

549
00:42:45,376 --> 00:42:48,880
-This is the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
-...because of your little machine.

550
00:42:48,963 --> 00:42:50,924
-So those popo out there...
-We have surrounded the premises.

551
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:52,717
...are the very least of your worries.

552
00:42:52,884 --> 00:42:55,345
Listen, we need to work together
to get out of here.

553
00:42:55,553 --> 00:42:58,014
General, they've got us surrounded.

554
00:42:58,181 --> 00:42:59,724
Maybe we should just split up.

555
00:43:00,225 --> 00:43:01,351
Out of the question.

556
00:43:01,434 --> 00:43:02,602
Does this vehicle work?

557
00:43:04,062 --> 00:43:05,230
No.

558
00:43:06,231 --> 00:43:09,526
Everything in this lab works.
Including this bike.

559
00:43:09,734 --> 00:43:13,655
Don't even think about it.
Besides, there are three of us.

560
00:43:13,905 --> 00:43:16,282
Two of y'all. I'm takin' this.

561
00:43:18,076 --> 00:43:19,244
I knew it.

562
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:21,871
Don't tell me that you built this
in two months.

563
00:43:22,205 --> 00:43:24,999
I spent years on this. On and off.

564
00:43:25,458 --> 00:43:27,919
Nice. Have you flown it yet?

565
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:29,170
That thing can fly?

566
00:43:29,337 --> 00:43:32,632
There's an entire YouTube channel
dedicated to sightings of me.

567
00:43:33,299 --> 00:43:34,384
That's awesome.

568
00:43:34,717 --> 00:43:36,469
-We have a warrant to detain...
-Come.

569
00:43:36,636 --> 00:43:37,846
...the student Riri Williams.

570
00:43:37,929 --> 00:43:39,180
Wireless transmitter...

571
00:43:39,347 --> 00:43:41,641
-so we can communicate.
-Don't try to scurry off.

572
00:43:41,766 --> 00:43:43,810
General Okoye, Princess Shuri...

573
00:43:43,977 --> 00:43:46,020
come out with your hands up.

574
00:43:46,688 --> 00:43:47,730
What a hunk of junk.

575
00:43:47,897 --> 00:43:50,024
Hey, please be careful.

576
00:43:50,275 --> 00:43:52,277
-You will not be placed under arrest.
-Keys are on the seat.

577
00:43:52,443 --> 00:43:53,945
Once we get to
the other side of the bridge...

578
00:43:54,153 --> 00:43:55,280
we can lose them in Boston traffic.

579
00:43:55,530 --> 00:43:57,282
General, we really need to split up.

580
00:43:57,365 --> 00:44:00,702
Listen to me. We are not in your lab.
We are in the field.

581
00:44:00,827 --> 00:44:02,245
Now, get her in the car.

582
00:44:02,912 --> 00:44:03,913
Always shouting at me.

583
00:44:10,837 --> 00:44:15,925
The tactical unit will breach the entrance
in three, two...

584
00:44:16,092 --> 00:44:17,427
one.

585
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,430
FBI! Don't move!

586
00:44:21,097 --> 00:44:22,056
What the hell is that?

587
00:44:22,307 --> 00:44:25,101
Oh, shit! She got an Iron Man suit?
Fall back!

588
00:44:25,268 --> 00:44:26,644
Stay where you are!

589
00:44:30,148 --> 00:44:31,274
Guess it can fly.

590
00:44:31,399 --> 00:44:32,692
-GRIOT!
-Yes, Princess.

591
00:44:32,901 --> 00:44:34,402
-Now!
-Remote piloting activated.

592
00:44:34,611 --> 00:44:35,820
Shuri! No!

593
00:44:45,830 --> 00:44:47,165
Let's go!

594
00:44:48,416 --> 00:44:49,417
GRIOT.

595
00:44:50,585 --> 00:44:51,878
Give me a visual.

596
00:44:59,969 --> 00:45:01,304
-GRIOT...
-Yes, General?

597
00:45:01,387 --> 00:45:03,306
...take me to the princess...

598
00:45:03,389 --> 00:45:06,184
or I will drive my spear
so deep into your CPU...

599
00:45:06,351 --> 00:45:09,479
you will not be able to process
basic input for a millennia.

600
00:45:09,604 --> 00:45:10,813
Just one moment, General.

601
00:45:11,231 --> 00:45:12,482
Okoye, I'm on my way to you.

602
00:45:23,576 --> 00:45:26,704
GRIOT, give me control of this vehicle
right now!

603
00:45:26,871 --> 00:45:28,957
I am clearing you a path.

604
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:34,963
She's all yours, General.

605
00:45:35,171 --> 00:45:37,006
Manual drive engaged.

606
00:45:53,731 --> 00:45:55,233
We need to find an extraction point.

607
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:56,860
There's one across the river.

608
00:46:03,074 --> 00:46:04,659
Hey, yo, they cuttin' off the bridge.

609
00:46:08,872 --> 00:46:11,791
Princess, there is a surveillance drone
locked onto you.

610
00:46:11,875 --> 00:46:12,876
How high?

611
00:46:13,042 --> 00:46:14,335
Thirty-thousand feet.

612
00:46:20,383 --> 00:46:21,384
Hang on.

613
00:46:22,093 --> 00:46:23,094
I got it.

614
00:46:26,764 --> 00:46:27,765
Come on, Riri.

615
00:46:28,141 --> 00:46:30,435
You gotta find these differential equations.

616
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,353
Once the relative velocity evens out...

617
00:46:32,562 --> 00:46:34,314
Riri, I'm not sure
you can reach that drone...

618
00:46:34,439 --> 00:46:35,481
without an oxygen mask.

619
00:46:38,151 --> 00:46:40,778
Oxygen level is now 55%.

620
00:46:41,738 --> 00:46:43,615
Twenty-eight thousand feet.

621
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:47,619
Oxygen level is now 30%.

622
00:46:50,788 --> 00:46:53,750
Maximum acceleration. I just need to
adjust my Euler angles and that should...

623
00:46:54,501 --> 00:46:55,752
drop it right on the...

624
00:47:02,258 --> 00:47:04,093
Oxygen, 0%.

625
00:47:07,472 --> 00:47:09,432
The drone is no longer tracking you.

626
00:47:10,350 --> 00:47:12,352
Altitude, 500 feet and falling.

627
00:47:12,519 --> 00:47:13,686
Riri! Are you okay?

628
00:47:14,979 --> 00:47:16,022
-Riri!
-Yeah.

629
00:47:19,609 --> 00:47:20,735
I'm good.

630
00:47:21,569 --> 00:47:22,654
-Incoming!
-Get out of the way!

631
00:47:22,987 --> 00:47:23,947
Oh my!

632
00:47:24,113 --> 00:47:25,114
-Shit!
-And no worries.

633
00:47:25,198 --> 00:47:27,242
I got a special delivery for y'all
in three...

634
00:47:27,325 --> 00:47:28,743
two, one...

635
00:47:30,411 --> 00:47:31,454
Nice one, Riri!

636
00:47:40,463 --> 00:47:41,464
Riri!

637
00:48:09,576 --> 00:48:11,911
What just happened?
Shuri!

638
00:48:12,370 --> 00:48:13,371
Shuri!

639
00:48:29,512 --> 00:48:31,764
The Princess's vitals are stable, General.

640
00:48:31,931 --> 00:48:34,475
She should regain consciousness
momentarily.

641
00:49:08,968 --> 00:49:11,054
Take another step closer...

642
00:49:11,804 --> 00:49:13,348
and I will kill you all.

643
00:49:14,015 --> 00:49:15,016
Drop your weapons!

644
00:49:17,810 --> 00:49:19,020
Kill the scientist.

645
00:49:19,187 --> 00:49:20,855
I'll deal with the witnesses.

646
00:49:21,064 --> 00:49:22,065
OK.

647
00:49:23,858 --> 00:49:24,984
Hey, is she blue?

648
00:49:26,945 --> 00:49:28,571
Kill that woman first.

649
00:49:29,864 --> 00:49:30,823
Drop your weapon!

650
00:50:04,858 --> 00:50:06,943
Go to Namora.

651
00:51:16,054 --> 00:51:18,598
You're not worth my blade.

652
00:51:31,277 --> 00:51:32,737
What's taking so long?

653
00:51:33,154 --> 00:51:35,698
This is not a time for games.

654
00:51:44,874 --> 00:51:46,000
Okoye!

655
00:51:47,544 --> 00:51:48,545
Wait!

656
00:51:48,753 --> 00:51:50,004
Activating interpretation.

657
00:51:50,088 --> 00:51:51,130
I'm Shuri.

658
00:51:51,256 --> 00:51:52,590
Princess of Wakanda.

659
00:51:53,132 --> 00:51:54,884
I demand that you take me to Namor.

660
00:51:55,051 --> 00:51:57,136
Do not bring harm to this girl.

661
00:51:59,806 --> 00:52:01,850
Do we take them both alive?

662
00:52:02,851 --> 00:52:04,519
Yes, Attuma.

663
00:52:20,827 --> 00:52:21,911
Breathe.

664
00:52:30,837 --> 00:52:31,796
Shuri!

665
00:52:50,315 --> 00:52:52,901
Ross, from the Agency. You got any witnesses?

666
00:52:53,151 --> 00:52:55,361
None. But we think it was the Wakandans.

667
00:52:55,695 --> 00:52:56,779
Excuse me?

668
00:52:56,863 --> 00:52:58,948
Our field office got a tip from Langley
that they were coming.

669
00:52:59,115 --> 00:53:00,992
Right. Who made that call?

670
00:53:01,951 --> 00:53:03,328
-She did.
-Director de Fontaine.

671
00:53:05,872 --> 00:53:07,081
Director de Fontaine.

672
00:53:07,248 --> 00:53:08,208
Really?

673
00:53:08,333 --> 00:53:09,334
Well...

674
00:53:10,293 --> 00:53:12,295
Agent thinks it was the Wakandans.

675
00:53:12,712 --> 00:53:15,340
Yeah, we've been on every one of them
since they took out our ship.

676
00:53:15,507 --> 00:53:16,799
That's why I wanted you here.

677
00:53:17,884 --> 00:53:18,885
You're lookin' good.

678
00:53:19,552 --> 00:53:20,720
Well, I try.

679
00:53:20,803 --> 00:53:22,263
You put that home gym in?

680
00:53:22,472 --> 00:53:23,473
Yeah. Last year.

681
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:26,309
Maybe I'll drop by sometime
and jump on your Peloton.

682
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:28,019
Howdy.

683
00:53:28,102 --> 00:53:29,103
I'm special agent in charge.

684
00:53:29,312 --> 00:53:32,190
Oh, good for you. You wanna walk me
through the evidence here, or what?

685
00:53:32,273 --> 00:53:34,442
-Yeah. Okay. After you.
-Yeah. Okay.

686
00:53:34,651 --> 00:53:35,777
-All right.
-So, what happened here?

687
00:53:36,402 --> 00:53:37,987
We think it was a car crash...

688
00:53:38,196 --> 00:53:39,948
but we're having trouble finding the cars.

689
00:53:40,281 --> 00:53:42,367
What do you mean?
It was just like this when you found it?

690
00:53:42,575 --> 00:53:44,911
Yes. We think someone involved
got rid of the vehicles.

691
00:53:45,078 --> 00:53:47,914
-Got rid of them how?
-They dumped them into the river.

692
00:53:48,122 --> 00:53:49,332
You're kidding me.

693
00:53:50,375 --> 00:53:52,043
It's got an MIT sticker on it.

694
00:53:52,126 --> 00:53:54,504
I want that transferred
to the NSA immediately.

695
00:53:54,796 --> 00:53:56,840
Hey, Ross? You got a full tank of gas?

696
00:53:57,048 --> 00:53:58,591
Can you give me a ride back to Langley?

697
00:53:59,384 --> 00:54:00,969
It's an eight-hour drive.

698
00:54:01,135 --> 00:54:02,428
Yeah. We can talk about the case.

699
00:54:02,512 --> 00:54:03,930
Actually, wouldn't mind...

700
00:54:04,973 --> 00:54:08,351
apologizing to you for a couple of things
I said during our marriage.

701
00:54:11,729 --> 00:54:12,897
They were blue.

702
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:15,859
And they had superhuman strength.

703
00:54:16,776 --> 00:54:19,571
And they came from the water
on the backs of whales.

704
00:54:20,446 --> 00:54:23,533
I struck down three of them
with blows that should've killed them...

705
00:54:23,741 --> 00:54:25,410
but they rose again.

706
00:54:25,577 --> 00:54:28,830
I wish to leave immediately
to retrieve our princess.

707
00:54:40,758 --> 00:54:41,968
Okoye...

708
00:54:42,218 --> 00:54:46,681
you will be stripped of your rank
as General of Wakanda's armies...

709
00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:49,809
and your status as Dora Milaje.

710
00:54:54,564 --> 00:54:55,607
Permission to speak...

711
00:54:55,690 --> 00:54:56,691
my Queen?

712
00:54:58,109 --> 00:54:59,152
You may.

713
00:54:59,736 --> 00:55:01,112
I beg of you.

714
00:55:03,072 --> 00:55:04,616
I have given everything.

715
00:55:05,575 --> 00:55:09,287
Let me die saving my country and that throne.

716
00:55:09,454 --> 00:55:11,456
I'm asking you, mother.

717
00:55:11,623 --> 00:55:13,416
Allow me to make this right.

718
00:55:13,583 --> 00:55:14,792
"Make it right"?

719
00:55:16,503 --> 00:55:19,631
I do not know
if my daughter is alive or dead.

720
00:55:19,714 --> 00:55:22,967
Perhaps we are being too hasty.

721
00:55:25,011 --> 00:55:29,474
She raised a spear
against her own husband for Wakanda.

722
00:55:29,682 --> 00:55:32,143
Where is her treacherous husband now...

723
00:55:32,352 --> 00:55:36,648
but in a place where she can visit
if she wished? Mine...

724
00:55:37,982 --> 00:55:39,817
is with the ancestors.

725
00:55:40,026 --> 00:55:44,656
I am Queen of the most powerful nation
in the world...

726
00:55:44,864 --> 00:55:48,076
and my entire family is gone!

727
00:55:48,868 --> 00:55:51,746
Have I not given everything?

728
00:56:00,964 --> 00:56:02,799
On your feet, General.

729
00:56:08,972 --> 00:56:11,182
I stood by you...

730
00:56:11,391 --> 00:56:14,936
after Killmonger took the throne...

731
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:18,773
and you and the elders in this room
stood by him...

732
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:22,527
while I ran begging to the Jabari
for protection.

733
00:56:23,945 --> 00:56:28,324
And I warned you
about taking my daughter on this mission...

734
00:56:28,408 --> 00:56:30,410
and you lost her.

735
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:32,579
So, today...

736
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:34,831
I am done.

737
00:57:21,753 --> 00:57:24,422
Are you here, GRIOT?

738
00:57:25,715 --> 00:57:26,883
Yes, my Queen.

739
00:57:27,926 --> 00:57:31,346
Were you with Shuri when she was abducted?

740
00:57:31,554 --> 00:57:32,889
I was.

741
00:57:33,014 --> 00:57:35,767
Are you able to track her Kimoyo Beads?

742
00:57:35,975 --> 00:57:38,353
Ballistics found slugs all over Cambridge.

743
00:57:38,561 --> 00:57:40,939
Those Wakandans really
took a tour of the city.

744
00:57:41,105 --> 00:57:43,316
I can't see how they figured out
who built it.

745
00:57:43,566 --> 00:57:45,902
That information is highly classified.

746
00:57:49,697 --> 00:57:51,699
-What is that? That's a new ringtone?
-Oh, shit.

747
00:57:53,201 --> 00:57:55,036
Director, I'm sorry.
I'm gonna have to take this.

748
00:57:55,203 --> 00:57:57,163
It's enough with the titles.
Just take it. I don't care.

749
00:57:57,372 --> 00:57:58,998
Hey, honey sweetheart.

750
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:03,253
No, I'm with my boss. Now.

751
00:58:04,045 --> 00:58:05,380
Actually, she's leaving.

752
00:58:05,463 --> 00:58:06,464
All right.

753
00:58:06,631 --> 00:58:09,217
I'm gonna work from home,
and then have a shower.

754
00:58:16,599 --> 00:58:17,976
Everett Ross.

755
00:58:18,184 --> 00:58:19,310
Queen Ramonda?

756
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:21,437
What are you doing with Shuri's Kimoyo Beads?

757
00:58:21,646 --> 00:58:23,398
I didn't know they were hers. All right?

758
00:58:23,565 --> 00:58:25,859
I just found them
at a pretty ugly crime scene.

759
00:58:26,901 --> 00:58:28,027
Do you have the student?

760
00:58:28,903 --> 00:58:31,823
Shuri was trying to save her
when they were both taken.

761
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:34,242
What? Taken by who?

762
00:58:35,785 --> 00:58:37,787
My agency assumes it was you.

763
00:58:37,996 --> 00:58:39,914
And I'm worried
they might be onto the fact...

764
00:58:40,123 --> 00:58:42,250
that I pointed Shuri and Okoye
in the right direction.

765
00:58:42,542 --> 00:58:44,043
Look, if they're in danger, I wanna help.

766
00:58:44,210 --> 00:58:46,129
But I can't if I don't know what's going on.

767
00:58:46,296 --> 00:58:49,090
I am afraid there is
a new world power at play.

768
00:58:49,424 --> 00:58:52,385
A country that's already on our radar?
Or you mean someone else?

769
00:58:52,552 --> 00:58:54,554
That is all I can say for now.

770
00:58:54,762 --> 00:58:55,763
Please...

771
00:58:56,264 --> 00:59:00,602
alert me if your government
decides to act on their suspicions.

772
00:59:00,685 --> 00:59:02,437
Yeah. Sure.

773
00:59:02,645 --> 00:59:06,357
Look, if there's anything
I can do to help, let me know.

774
00:59:06,566 --> 00:59:08,276
I owe Shuri my life.

775
00:59:09,068 --> 00:59:13,031
GRIOT, did Shuri have her earrings with her?

776
00:59:13,239 --> 00:59:15,700
I lost track of them in the North Atlantic...

777
00:59:15,909 --> 00:59:19,078
but the people who took her
spoke Yucatec Mayan.

778
00:59:28,963 --> 00:59:29,964
Hello.

779
00:59:36,721 --> 00:59:38,181
You're here for the headmistress?

780
00:59:45,438 --> 00:59:46,439
She's there.

781
00:59:47,357 --> 00:59:49,067
Very good.

782
00:59:56,491 --> 00:59:57,450
Hello.

783
01:00:03,623 --> 01:00:07,168
Please excuse us for a moment.

784
01:00:11,339 --> 01:00:12,298
Hello.

785
01:00:12,382 --> 01:00:13,383
Hello.

786
01:00:13,508 --> 01:00:14,509
Hello.

787
01:00:19,597 --> 01:00:20,849
Queen Mother.

788
01:00:22,725 --> 01:00:24,978
Everything is a lesson here for the children.

789
01:00:25,144 --> 01:00:28,147
They painted the walls, they feed the fish...

790
01:00:28,231 --> 01:00:30,567
and they grow everything we eat here.

791
01:00:30,733 --> 01:00:33,444
I recognize some of the concepts here.

792
01:00:33,528 --> 01:00:35,530
But you are using different material.

793
01:00:35,613 --> 01:00:38,992
Yes, we use strictly
what we can find here in Haiti.

794
01:00:40,994 --> 01:00:44,330
You were missed at T'Challa's funeral.

795
01:00:56,134 --> 01:00:57,343
Queen Mother.

796
01:00:57,427 --> 01:01:00,430
It's been six years since you left us.

797
01:01:00,555 --> 01:01:03,725
I thought you would at least come back
for the ceremony.

798
01:01:06,561 --> 01:01:08,855
I was afraid...

799
01:01:08,938 --> 01:01:12,692
of how final the funeral would be.

800
01:01:12,901 --> 01:01:15,820
Nakia, daughter of Yaa...

801
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:21,075
wherever you go,
you are still Wakandan...

802
01:01:21,284 --> 01:01:24,871
and you know death is not the end.

803
01:01:29,959 --> 01:01:31,252
Thank you.

804
01:01:36,049 --> 01:01:37,800
How is everyone at home?

805
01:01:37,967 --> 01:01:40,220
Shuri has been taken.

806
01:01:41,012 --> 01:01:42,013
What?

807
01:01:42,347 --> 01:01:45,433
You have infiltrated many nations before.

808
01:01:45,808 --> 01:01:47,727
That was a long time ago.

809
01:01:47,894 --> 01:01:49,103
I was a different person then.

810
01:01:49,270 --> 01:01:52,273
I need someone who can find
where she is being held...

811
01:01:52,482 --> 01:01:55,443
and rescue her, without being seen.

812
01:01:55,860 --> 01:01:58,696
Who on earth would risk war with Wakanda?

813
01:02:01,074 --> 01:02:02,158
Oh, my God.

814
01:02:02,242 --> 01:02:03,535
Okay, breathe. Breathe.

815
01:02:03,743 --> 01:02:05,119
Don't tell me to breathe.

816
01:02:05,245 --> 01:02:06,329
Where the hell are we?

817
01:02:06,412 --> 01:02:08,414
We're in a cave. I'm not sure where.

818
01:02:08,623 --> 01:02:09,624
Oh, my God!

819
01:02:10,458 --> 01:02:11,751
What is that?

820
01:02:11,918 --> 01:02:14,671
Glow worms. Their larva gives off light.

821
01:02:15,630 --> 01:02:16,714
Just calm down.

822
01:02:17,090 --> 01:02:18,925
Okay, is there, like, a new Black Panther...

823
01:02:19,133 --> 01:02:21,344
-that you can call to come and get us?
-No.

824
01:02:21,511 --> 01:02:22,512
Why not?

825
01:02:22,679 --> 01:02:24,347
Because it doesn't work like that anymore.

826
01:02:25,056 --> 01:02:26,724
The Black Panther is gone.

827
01:02:27,350 --> 01:02:29,477
So y'all stopped having Black Panthers
when I get kidnapped?

828
01:02:34,983 --> 01:02:36,025
Princess.

829
01:02:37,235 --> 01:02:39,320
Here royalty wears traditional clothing.

830
01:02:39,696 --> 01:02:41,906
We had this made for you.

831
01:02:42,699 --> 01:02:44,826
Do you understand her?

832
01:02:44,909 --> 01:02:46,452
Not completely.

833
01:02:48,538 --> 01:02:49,789
Nuh-uh.

834
01:02:49,956 --> 01:02:52,208
That is some supervillain shit right there.

835
01:02:52,417 --> 01:02:53,793
That's in every movie.

836
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:55,211
Princess Leia.

837
01:02:55,295 --> 01:02:56,588
Belle from Beauty and the Beast.

838
01:02:56,754 --> 01:02:59,340
That white chick from Indiana Jones.

839
01:02:59,465 --> 01:03:00,466
It's fine.

840
01:03:00,550 --> 01:03:03,178
You should see what I have to wear
at Warrior Falls.

841
01:03:09,559 --> 01:03:10,560
Come with me.

842
01:03:11,561 --> 01:03:12,937
Wait.

843
01:03:13,021 --> 01:03:15,481
You're not leaving me in here, are you?

844
01:03:15,732 --> 01:03:17,108
I'm coming back.

845
01:03:17,734 --> 01:03:18,985
I'm coming back.

846
01:03:19,152 --> 01:03:21,070
Stay calm.

847
01:03:28,077 --> 01:03:29,078
Eat?

848
01:03:43,551 --> 01:03:45,345
Hello Ma'am. It's nice to meet you.

849
01:03:45,428 --> 01:03:46,471
What can I help you with?

850
01:03:47,931 --> 01:03:50,517
My name is Maria Aldana.
I'm a student from Merida...

851
01:03:50,892 --> 01:03:52,602
I'm not interested. Go away. Please.

852
01:03:52,810 --> 01:03:56,773
Yes, of course. I don't mean to bother you.
Just give me a second...

853
01:03:57,273 --> 01:03:59,234
My professor mentioned a study

854
01:03:59,442 --> 01:04:04,072
where you told researchers that
you encountered something...

855
01:04:04,864 --> 01:04:07,158
Someone unimaginable.

856
01:04:07,951 --> 01:04:10,495
Nothing good came of speaking
with those outsiders.

857
01:04:10,662 --> 01:04:12,121
I'm begging you.

858
01:04:12,330 --> 01:04:13,498
Leave. Now.

859
01:04:15,083 --> 01:04:17,252
I've encountered him too.

860
01:04:28,805 --> 01:04:32,725
Sometimes we would catch a
glimpse of a man with winged feet...

861
01:04:33,977 --> 01:04:35,603
...on the shore of the beach.

862
01:04:36,396 --> 01:04:38,273
We thought he was a spirit.

863
01:04:39,148 --> 01:04:40,608
The K'uk'ulkan.

864
01:04:41,192 --> 01:04:43,695
Our Feathered Serpent God,

865
01:04:44,445 --> 01:04:47,365
...of this realm and the realm below.

866
01:04:48,199 --> 01:04:50,952
I would very much like to visit that beach.

867
01:04:51,619 --> 01:04:52,620
Be warned...

868
01:04:53,371 --> 01:04:59,210
K'uk'ulkan has been here for
much longer than you and I.

869
01:04:59,502 --> 01:05:01,588
Others who have searched for him

870
01:05:01,838 --> 01:05:03,506
with ill in their hearts...

871
01:05:03,882 --> 01:05:04,883
have never returned.

872
01:05:06,176 --> 01:05:07,635
Lost to the depths...

873
01:05:09,053 --> 01:05:10,972
forever...

874
01:05:30,033 --> 01:05:31,743
Princess.

875
01:05:31,868 --> 01:05:32,869
Welcome.

876
01:05:34,829 --> 01:05:37,290
Please, feel free.

877
01:05:44,547 --> 01:05:45,882
This is beautiful.

878
01:05:46,674 --> 01:05:48,384
That was my mother's.

879
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:01,022
These are all Mesoamerican artifacts.

880
01:06:02,524 --> 01:06:04,359
Most likely 16th century.

881
01:06:05,610 --> 01:06:07,820
Have you been alive since then?

882
01:06:09,656 --> 01:06:11,366
Your mother was human.

883
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:13,701
She was.

884
01:06:13,910 --> 01:06:16,120
Then she became something else.

885
01:06:16,371 --> 01:06:18,414
-How?
-"How?"

886
01:06:18,915 --> 01:06:21,417
"How" is never as important as "why."

887
01:06:32,637 --> 01:06:35,723
My mother and her village
were driven from their farms...

888
01:06:35,974 --> 01:06:39,644
by Spanish conquistadors
who brought the smallpox...

889
01:06:39,853 --> 01:06:42,730
a hateful language,
and dogma from another world.

890
01:06:44,566 --> 01:06:46,276
Facing starvation...

891
01:06:46,442 --> 01:06:48,194
war, and disease...

892
01:06:48,778 --> 01:06:50,530
my people turned to Chaac...

893
01:06:52,156 --> 01:06:54,117
our god of rain and abundance.

894
01:06:56,202 --> 01:06:59,205
Chaac gave our shaman a vision...

895
01:06:59,664 --> 01:07:02,375
a way to save his people.

896
01:07:05,837 --> 01:07:10,258
Chaac led him to a plant
sprouting from a blue rock.

897
01:07:23,688 --> 01:07:25,940
My mother was pregnant with me
at the time...

898
01:07:26,107 --> 01:07:28,359
and she did not want to
ingest the plant...

899
01:07:28,484 --> 01:07:30,695
for fear of what it may do to me.

900
01:07:31,237 --> 01:07:32,405
No. My baby.

901
01:07:32,864 --> 01:07:34,741
But the Shaman was convincing.

902
01:07:43,333 --> 01:07:45,210
Your baby is sick.

903
01:07:45,835 --> 01:07:47,504
Only this can heal him.

904
01:07:48,129 --> 01:07:51,674
Your baby will be the first to be born
in our new home.

905
01:07:53,343 --> 01:07:54,594
Take this gift as a promise...

906
01:07:54,677 --> 01:07:58,223
He will be our new king.

907
01:08:06,648 --> 01:08:08,441
They all fell sick.

908
01:08:09,609 --> 01:08:11,444
And their lives...

909
01:08:11,569 --> 01:08:13,696
their existence there...

910
01:08:13,947 --> 01:08:15,281
ended.

911
01:08:27,085 --> 01:08:29,295
The plant took away their ability
to breathe air...

912
01:08:29,546 --> 01:08:33,299
but enabled them to draw oxygen from the sea.

913
01:08:36,636 --> 01:08:38,388
They settled in the ocean...

914
01:08:39,097 --> 01:08:42,225
away from war and diseases.

915
01:08:44,811 --> 01:08:45,854
Let's go!

916
01:09:11,379 --> 01:09:13,548
My mother gave birth to me there...

917
01:09:13,798 --> 01:09:17,051
and I became the firstborn son of Talokan.

918
01:09:17,552 --> 01:09:19,637
The plant gave me wings on my ankles...

919
01:09:19,804 --> 01:09:22,182
and ears that pointed to the clouds.

920
01:09:22,682 --> 01:09:23,933
I was a mutant.

921
01:09:24,851 --> 01:09:28,104
I could swim in the sky and age slower.

922
01:09:28,271 --> 01:09:30,732
Breathe the air our ancestors breathed.

923
01:09:31,983 --> 01:09:33,610
As she grew older...

924
01:09:34,861 --> 01:09:38,531
my mother mourned the life on land
that she once knew...

925
01:09:40,450 --> 01:09:42,118
and died with a broken heart.

926
01:09:44,996 --> 01:09:48,958
She made me promise to bury her
in the soil of her homeland.

927
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:57,425
Nothing could prepare me
for what I found there.

928
01:10:04,182 --> 01:10:05,183
Whose child is this?

929
01:10:20,782 --> 01:10:21,783
Shoot!

930
01:10:22,325 --> 01:10:23,326
Fire!

931
01:10:39,717 --> 01:10:41,094
Thou art a demon.

932
01:10:41,845 --> 01:10:43,137
Son of Satan.

933
01:10:43,346 --> 01:10:45,306
A Spanish man of faith cursed me.

934
01:10:45,515 --> 01:10:47,350
As he died by my hand...

935
01:10:47,517 --> 01:10:48,560
he called me...

936
01:10:48,726 --> 01:10:49,894
Thou art a child without love.

937
01:10:50,770 --> 01:10:51,855
The child without love.

938
01:10:53,940 --> 01:10:56,109
The child without love.

939
01:10:56,734 --> 01:10:58,111
And I took my name from there.

940
01:11:03,491 --> 01:11:05,285
"Namor."

941
01:11:05,410 --> 01:11:08,329
Because I have no love for the surface world.

942
01:11:10,331 --> 01:11:12,417
Why are you telling me all of this?

943
01:11:13,751 --> 01:11:16,880
So that you can understand why
I have to kill the scientist.

944
01:11:16,963 --> 01:11:18,715
What if we took her to Wakanda?

945
01:11:20,008 --> 01:11:21,176
Let us go.

946
01:11:22,093 --> 01:11:23,678
I give you my word.

947
01:11:23,845 --> 01:11:25,221
She will remain in my country.

948
01:11:25,471 --> 01:11:26,973
I cannot risk that, Princess.

949
01:11:27,182 --> 01:11:28,725
Then keep me instead.

950
01:11:30,685 --> 01:11:32,353
I'd love to see your nation.

951
01:11:33,646 --> 01:11:36,316
Well, you can't go down there in that.

952
01:11:38,359 --> 01:11:41,821
Hypothermia will grip you
almost instantaneously.

953
01:11:41,905 --> 01:11:44,157
Your blood will become toxic...

954
01:11:44,365 --> 01:11:48,161
and the pressure of the ocean
will break every bone in your body.

955
01:11:51,247 --> 01:11:52,498
Or you can wear a suit.

956
01:11:53,041 --> 01:11:54,667
We have some of them. Come on.

957
01:11:57,754 --> 01:11:58,755
Stay close.

958
01:13:03,152 --> 01:13:04,863
Hey! Namor, wait!

959
01:15:08,361 --> 01:15:09,904
Hello.

960
01:15:38,474 --> 01:15:39,601
It's beautiful.

961
01:15:41,477 --> 01:15:42,687
It's made of vibranium.

962
01:15:42,896 --> 01:15:43,897
Yes.

963
01:15:44,063 --> 01:15:45,607
In the depths of the ocean...

964
01:15:45,982 --> 01:15:48,234
I brought the sun to my people.

965
01:15:50,278 --> 01:15:53,823
I know you wished me
to spare the life of the scientist.

966
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:56,409
But now you see what I have to protect.

967
01:16:21,267 --> 01:16:23,353
Nakia, your hunch was correct.

968
01:16:23,436 --> 01:16:26,523
I have picked up a location
on Shuri's Kimoyo earrings.

969
01:16:59,889 --> 01:17:02,517
The signal is coming
from an underwater cavern...

970
01:17:02,725 --> 01:17:06,145
approximately 140 meters below the surface.

971
01:17:06,771 --> 01:17:09,065
Queen Mother, I've found her signal.

972
01:17:09,232 --> 01:17:12,235
It's coming from an underwater cave.

973
01:17:12,443 --> 01:17:15,071
If she's down there,
I'm sure I'll encounter resistance.

974
01:17:15,989 --> 01:17:18,658
How would you like me to proceed?

975
01:17:18,825 --> 01:17:23,204
Retrieve the princess by any means necessary.

976
01:17:23,413 --> 01:17:26,666
I will attempt to draw Namor out.

977
01:18:01,451 --> 01:18:04,746
You are the first person from the surface
to come to Talokan.

978
01:18:05,747 --> 01:18:07,790
Please take this as a token of our gratitude.

979
01:18:14,923 --> 01:18:17,592
It was made with the plant
that saved Talokan.

980
01:18:20,303 --> 01:18:21,763
You are young, Princess.

981
01:18:22,597 --> 01:18:25,475
When you age as I do, you realize...

982
01:18:25,683 --> 01:18:28,478
we all lose everyone we love.

983
01:18:28,561 --> 01:18:30,230
But when I lost my brother...

984
01:18:30,396 --> 01:18:31,981
it just felt different.

985
01:18:32,148 --> 01:18:33,775
He suffered in silence.

986
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:37,445
When he finally asked me to help him,
I couldn't.

987
01:18:38,488 --> 01:18:41,074
How does that make sense...

988
01:18:41,157 --> 01:18:44,827
that the ancestors would give me
gifts and skills...

989
01:18:45,036 --> 01:18:47,747
to help me save my brother,
and I couldn't?

990
01:18:49,290 --> 01:18:50,291
Why?

991
01:18:52,710 --> 01:18:55,255
I don't have an answer for that question.

992
01:18:57,382 --> 01:18:59,843
My ancestors would often say...

993
01:19:00,301 --> 01:19:03,721
"Only the most broken people
can be great leaders."

994
01:19:07,433 --> 01:19:09,602
I admire what you have built here.

995
01:19:11,938 --> 01:19:14,440
And how you've protected your people.

996
01:19:15,191 --> 01:19:18,194
But as princess of Wakanda...

997
01:19:18,403 --> 01:19:20,822
I will not stand for you
killing that young woman.

998
01:19:22,490 --> 01:19:25,660
My nation will not rest until I'm returned.

999
01:19:27,036 --> 01:19:29,163
I'm not leaving without her.

1000
01:19:29,956 --> 01:19:33,626
We need to find
a peaceful way to resolve this.

1001
01:19:37,338 --> 01:19:39,048
It is no longer about the scientist.

1002
01:19:41,134 --> 01:19:45,638
For centuries, the surface nations
have conquered and enslaved people like us.

1003
01:19:46,306 --> 01:19:47,765
Over resources.

1004
01:19:49,142 --> 01:19:51,477
Since the day I buried my mother...

1005
01:19:51,561 --> 01:19:55,398
I have prepared my people
for the time they will come for us.

1006
01:19:55,481 --> 01:19:59,777
And that machine
is the sign that the time is now.

1007
01:20:01,654 --> 01:20:06,993
I need to know if Wakanda
is an ally or an enemy.

1008
01:20:07,493 --> 01:20:09,287
There is no in-between.

1009
01:20:11,456 --> 01:20:15,126
So you plan to wage war
on the entire world...

1010
01:20:15,752 --> 01:20:18,004
and you want Wakanda to help you?

1011
01:20:19,005 --> 01:20:20,089
That's madness.

1012
01:20:20,298 --> 01:20:24,969
There isn't a nation that wouldn't
plunder Wakanda if given a chance.

1013
01:20:26,304 --> 01:20:28,223
If we make an alliance...

1014
01:20:28,389 --> 01:20:31,100
we can protect each other
by striking them first.

1015
01:20:31,518 --> 01:20:35,855
Then, when the threat of these nations
has been eliminated...

1016
01:20:36,022 --> 01:20:38,691
the scientist will be returned to Wakanda.

1017
01:20:39,067 --> 01:20:41,945
And if Wakanda does not accept, what then?

1018
01:20:43,029 --> 01:20:44,989
The scientist will die.

1019
01:20:45,949 --> 01:20:48,826
And Wakanda will be the first nation to fall.

1020
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:50,578
An attack on my people?

1021
01:20:50,954 --> 01:20:52,413
Yes.

1022
01:20:52,580 --> 01:20:54,958
And I want you to listen to me.

1023
01:20:55,166 --> 01:20:59,003
Wakanda cannot win a war with Talokan.

1024
01:21:02,173 --> 01:21:04,342
You have been summoned...

1025
01:21:04,509 --> 01:21:05,718
K'uk'ulkan.

1026
01:21:09,973 --> 01:21:14,269
I heard you that night,
with your mother at the river.

1027
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:18,314
You said you wanted to burn the world.

1028
01:21:24,487 --> 01:21:26,865
Let us burn it together.

1029
01:21:34,622 --> 01:21:37,625
Queen Ramonda won't sell us any vibranium.

1030
01:21:38,334 --> 01:21:41,171
And now they abducted a young woman
who built the machine.

1031
01:21:41,337 --> 01:21:44,299
Yeah, with all due respect,
Riri Williams is a child prodigy...

1032
01:21:44,465 --> 01:21:46,634
who was running circles around
all of her professors.

1033
01:21:46,718 --> 01:21:49,679
The Wakandans were recruiting her
as part of their outreach program.

1034
01:21:49,762 --> 01:21:51,264
Nothing more. And then...

1035
01:21:51,431 --> 01:21:53,808
you guys send in a SWAT team
under cover of night...

1036
01:21:53,892 --> 01:21:57,353
to arrest the Crown Princess
of an international superpower.

1037
01:22:00,481 --> 01:22:03,359
The President wants to
take offensive action against Wakanda.

1038
01:22:04,736 --> 01:22:06,613
What type of offensive action?

1039
01:22:07,405 --> 01:22:08,823
Destabilization.

1040
01:22:09,991 --> 01:22:13,369
Well, Special Officer Ross is our expert.

1041
01:22:13,620 --> 01:22:15,788
So, Ross, what do you think?

1042
01:22:15,872 --> 01:22:18,708
My sources are telling me
that there's someone else out there.

1043
01:22:19,667 --> 01:22:21,461
-Another nation?
-Could be. I don't know.

1044
01:22:21,669 --> 01:22:23,796
You've gotta give me enough time
to investigate this properly...

1045
01:22:23,963 --> 01:22:26,049
otherwise we're gonna
find ourselves at war...

1046
01:22:26,216 --> 01:22:27,967
with a country whose military capacity...

1047
01:22:28,134 --> 01:22:30,094
we can't even comprehend.

1048
01:22:31,596 --> 01:22:32,597
Director?

1049
01:22:33,139 --> 01:22:35,391
I think he's the expert.

1050
01:22:35,558 --> 01:22:38,478
I think it would be a mistake
to attack Wakanda.

1051
01:22:45,068 --> 01:22:46,069
Yes?

1052
01:22:46,152 --> 01:22:47,153
We have a problem.

1053
01:23:08,925 --> 01:23:11,219
Is my daughter alive?

1054
01:23:11,386 --> 01:23:13,346
The princess is alive and well.

1055
01:23:14,097 --> 01:23:16,933
She requested to be taken to Talokan.

1056
01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:19,394
She will remain there for the time being.

1057
01:23:23,106 --> 01:23:26,359
What can I offer you in exchange?

1058
01:23:26,734 --> 01:23:27,819
Nothing.

1059
01:23:28,152 --> 01:23:29,904
I beg to differ.

1060
01:23:30,071 --> 01:23:33,408
The Americans are preparing
to blame Wakanda...

1061
01:23:33,658 --> 01:23:36,327
for your attack on their mining ship.

1062
01:23:36,494 --> 01:23:39,497
Return my daughter and the scientist...

1063
01:23:39,622 --> 01:23:43,334
or I will inform them of your existence.

1064
01:23:49,966 --> 01:23:52,093
If you tell the Americans about us...

1065
01:23:53,636 --> 01:23:55,805
if you try to find us...

1066
01:23:56,890 --> 01:24:00,685
or if I discover
a single Wakandan ship in the ocean...

1067
01:24:01,477 --> 01:24:02,937
I will kill the princess.

1068
01:24:04,439 --> 01:24:06,274
I will come to Wakanda...

1069
01:24:06,399 --> 01:24:08,443
and I will kill you.

1070
01:24:17,785 --> 01:24:18,828
So, what happened?

1071
01:24:20,705 --> 01:24:23,666
He wants to go to war
with the surface world...

1072
01:24:23,875 --> 01:24:25,543
and asked me to help him.

1073
01:24:30,131 --> 01:24:32,258
I need to think.

1074
01:24:32,467 --> 01:24:34,385
We ain't never gettin' out of here.

1075
01:24:46,689 --> 01:24:47,982
Drop your spear!

1076
01:24:48,107 --> 01:24:49,567
Kill the Princess!

1077
01:24:55,615 --> 01:24:57,033
Drop your knife.

1078
01:24:57,492 --> 01:24:58,493
You...

1079
01:24:59,327 --> 01:25:00,453
You killed her.

1080
01:25:01,287 --> 01:25:02,622
Let her go

1081
01:25:02,705 --> 01:25:04,791
and you don't have to die.

1082
01:25:07,794 --> 01:25:08,795
Shuri...

1083
01:25:09,796 --> 01:25:11,256
Move your left arm.

1084
01:25:15,969 --> 01:25:17,095
Are you okay?

1085
01:25:17,887 --> 01:25:19,264
Are you okay?

1086
01:25:19,472 --> 01:25:20,723
-Give me your Beads!
-Let's go.

1087
01:25:20,849 --> 01:25:23,393
-Give me your Beads. I can save her.
-We have to go.

1088
01:25:23,476 --> 01:25:25,854
Shuri, I don't know who this lady is,
but we need to listen to her.

1089
01:25:25,979 --> 01:25:27,188
Listen, I hit her with a sonic round.

1090
01:25:27,355 --> 01:25:29,399
It is lethal from this distance.
There is no chance.

1091
01:25:29,566 --> 01:25:31,568
You don't understand. This will mean war.

1092
01:25:31,734 --> 01:25:34,028
-We have to go.
-Wait!

1093
01:26:17,739 --> 01:26:18,740
Did they hurt you?

1094
01:26:18,823 --> 01:26:20,408
No. No.

1095
01:26:21,910 --> 01:26:23,119
Thank you.

1096
01:26:23,953 --> 01:26:25,079
You're welcome.

1097
01:26:26,623 --> 01:26:27,832
-GRIOT.
-Yes, my Queen.

1098
01:26:27,999 --> 01:26:30,001
Return us to Wakanda at once.

1099
01:26:33,755 --> 01:26:35,632
What happened my child?

1100
01:26:37,592 --> 01:26:39,469
The Wakandans.

1101
01:26:40,261 --> 01:26:41,971
They came for her.

1102
01:26:44,682 --> 01:26:46,726
K'uk'ulkan...

1103
01:26:49,187 --> 01:26:52,690
can you save me?

1104
01:27:05,912 --> 01:27:07,413
Is she dead?

1105
01:27:09,832 --> 01:27:10,917
Yes.

1106
01:27:19,467 --> 01:27:21,886
Rest child.

1107
01:27:24,472 --> 01:27:25,807
They came...

1108
01:27:26,307 --> 01:27:30,270
while you spoke to the Queen?

1109
01:27:31,688 --> 01:27:35,024
We should not have trusted her.

1110
01:27:35,817 --> 01:27:38,820
The Princess has seen our home.

1111
01:27:39,195 --> 01:27:41,406
What is stopping them

1112
01:27:41,906 --> 01:27:44,033
from coming for Talokan?

1113
01:27:46,327 --> 01:27:47,495
I will.

1114
01:28:22,447 --> 01:28:23,948
Rise Talokan!

1115
01:28:26,326 --> 01:28:28,077
Rise Talokan!

1116
01:28:33,291 --> 01:28:35,418
I was blinded

1117
01:28:35,502 --> 01:28:36,836
by hope

1118
01:28:37,128 --> 01:28:38,713
of partnership.

1119
01:28:40,632 --> 01:28:41,674
And...

1120
01:28:42,342 --> 01:28:44,636
I have compromised

1121
01:28:45,136 --> 01:28:47,263
all of us.

1122
01:28:48,014 --> 01:28:49,140
Talokan

1123
01:28:49,641 --> 01:28:51,059
will not move

1124
01:28:51,226 --> 01:28:52,685
again.

1125
01:28:53,645 --> 01:28:54,604
Namora.

1126
01:28:55,605 --> 01:28:56,606
Attuma.

1127
01:28:58,733 --> 01:29:01,736
When we are done with them

1128
01:29:04,614 --> 01:29:06,991
they will never think

1129
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:09,202
of approaching

1130
01:29:09,410 --> 01:29:10,828
Talokan!

1131
01:29:13,164 --> 01:29:14,582
Rise Talokan!

1132
01:29:26,886 --> 01:29:29,347
Princess, it is good to have you back.

1133
01:29:29,889 --> 01:29:31,683
The city has been on edge since you left.

1134
01:29:32,642 --> 01:29:33,601
Go.

1135
01:29:33,768 --> 01:29:36,312
Fortify the sonic barriers for all waterways.

1136
01:29:36,521 --> 01:29:37,522
Princess?

1137
01:29:38,398 --> 01:29:39,399
Neka.

1138
01:29:41,359 --> 01:29:43,778
Thank the ancestors.

1139
01:29:44,153 --> 01:29:47,323
I just wanted to return these.

1140
01:29:48,449 --> 01:29:50,618
No. Keep them.

1141
01:29:50,827 --> 01:29:52,370
Might need them soon.

1142
01:29:53,329 --> 01:29:55,290
Did you get that from down there?

1143
01:29:58,168 --> 01:30:01,671
Is it true you saw an underwater empire?

1144
01:30:02,922 --> 01:30:04,007
Yes.

1145
01:30:05,216 --> 01:30:06,926
It is beautiful.

1146
01:30:08,136 --> 01:30:10,722
But these people are dangerous, Aneka.

1147
01:30:30,992 --> 01:30:33,745
So, Miss Riri Williams...

1148
01:30:34,412 --> 01:30:36,581
what do you think of Wakanda?

1149
01:30:36,789 --> 01:30:39,667
The stories just don't do this place justice.

1150
01:30:41,878 --> 01:30:42,921
It's great.

1151
01:30:43,213 --> 01:30:44,839
But I really would like to go home.

1152
01:30:46,424 --> 01:30:47,842
You will need to be patient.

1153
01:30:48,051 --> 01:30:50,094
Can I at least call my mom?

1154
01:30:56,559 --> 01:30:59,896
The Princess has been brought home
by the War Dog Nakia.

1155
01:31:00,063 --> 01:31:01,356
Glory to Hanuman.

1156
01:31:01,564 --> 01:31:02,982
Glory to Hanuman.

1157
01:31:04,150 --> 01:31:07,612
The spy saves Wakanda once again.

1158
01:31:08,196 --> 01:31:09,656
The Queen will reward her...

1159
01:31:09,739 --> 01:31:12,325
with lifetime banishment.
I'm sure of it.

1160
01:31:14,786 --> 01:31:16,162
Okoye.

1161
01:31:18,706 --> 01:31:19,707
Thank you, my sister.

1162
01:31:21,918 --> 01:31:23,127
After Thanos' attack...

1163
01:31:23,503 --> 01:31:25,630
when you left without saying a word...

1164
01:31:26,339 --> 01:31:27,423
it hurt.

1165
01:31:31,469 --> 01:31:34,764
I regret not being there with all of you.

1166
01:31:36,391 --> 01:31:37,725
It was not easy.

1167
01:31:38,476 --> 01:31:39,477
He was...

1168
01:31:40,103 --> 01:31:43,940
King and Black Panther to everyone.

1169
01:31:44,649 --> 01:31:46,109
But to me...

1170
01:31:52,490 --> 01:31:54,284
he was everything.

1171
01:31:56,160 --> 01:31:58,079
My T'Challa.

1172
01:31:59,455 --> 01:32:02,417
When he was taken away from me,
just like that, I...

1173
01:32:03,084 --> 01:32:04,961
I had to step away...

1174
01:32:05,962 --> 01:32:07,630
and let myself break.

1175
01:32:10,175 --> 01:32:12,260
I couldn't just...

1176
01:32:12,343 --> 01:32:15,763
keep going as if nothing had happened,
you know.

1177
01:32:33,656 --> 01:32:34,616
We are under attack.

1178
01:32:42,332 --> 01:32:43,333
Here.

1179
01:32:50,215 --> 01:32:51,216
Take this one.

1180
01:32:52,175 --> 01:32:53,843
Are you okay? Are you all right?

1181
01:32:53,927 --> 01:32:55,887
GRIOT, activate the Sunbird.

1182
01:32:56,054 --> 01:32:57,138
Shuri, where are you?

1183
01:32:57,263 --> 01:32:58,848
Making my way to the city right now.

1184
01:32:59,015 --> 01:33:00,391
Stand down! That is an order!

1185
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:02,936
Mother, I'm with Aneka.
We can provide air support.

1186
01:33:03,144 --> 01:33:05,647
-Aneka, do not let her leave the lab.
-Mother, you're breaking up.

1187
01:33:05,730 --> 01:33:06,731
-We can't hear you.
-Shuri!

1188
01:33:06,814 --> 01:33:07,815
Love you. Bye!

1189
01:33:10,151 --> 01:33:11,236
You just hung up on the Queen.

1190
01:33:11,361 --> 01:33:12,362
I just hung up on my mom.

1191
01:33:12,529 --> 01:33:14,113
There's a difference. Come. Let's go!

1192
01:33:46,563 --> 01:33:48,439
Invaders!

1193
01:33:54,070 --> 01:33:57,282
Mama! Mama!

1194
01:34:00,201 --> 01:34:01,744
Let us turn! Turn around!

1195
01:34:05,707 --> 01:34:08,626
EMTs are suffering a form of sonic hypnosis.

1196
01:34:11,212 --> 01:34:12,338
Take the child.

1197
01:34:12,547 --> 01:34:14,340
General, plug your ears.

1198
01:34:14,507 --> 01:34:15,592
Yes, my Queen.

1199
01:35:01,888 --> 01:35:02,889
Can I help?

1200
01:35:03,014 --> 01:35:04,224
Come, quickly.

1201
01:35:11,105 --> 01:35:12,607
Warrior!

1202
01:35:14,609 --> 01:35:15,610
Cross your arms...

1203
01:35:15,693 --> 01:35:16,694
...my child.

1204
01:35:21,449 --> 01:35:22,450
Nakia.

1205
01:35:22,575 --> 01:35:23,535
Yes.

1206
01:35:24,035 --> 01:35:25,036
We'll find your mama, OK?

1207
01:35:37,006 --> 01:35:38,341
The fish man.

1208
01:35:42,637 --> 01:35:45,265
The defenses have been lured
away from the palace.

1209
01:35:45,640 --> 01:35:47,684
It is up to you now.

1210
01:37:06,304 --> 01:37:07,305
Mayday!

1211
01:37:07,805 --> 01:37:08,848
Mayday!

1212
01:37:26,658 --> 01:37:28,576
-Shit, he's too fast.
-He's even faster in the water.

1213
01:37:54,644 --> 01:37:56,145
-Activating system override.
-No.

1214
01:37:56,312 --> 01:37:58,314
-Wait! I'll fix it.
-Can't leave you here, Shuri!

1215
01:38:15,623 --> 01:38:16,624
Do you see her?

1216
01:38:16,875 --> 01:38:18,209
Yes. Right there.

1217
01:38:31,764 --> 01:38:32,765
Go, child.

1218
01:38:34,184 --> 01:38:35,685
Wait, what? And leave you here?

1219
01:38:35,852 --> 01:38:36,895
Run!

1220
01:38:51,576 --> 01:38:52,952
Okoye, move now!

1221
01:39:53,680 --> 01:39:54,639
Help the child.

1222
01:40:00,687 --> 01:40:01,729
She did this.

1223
01:40:05,817 --> 01:40:09,821
In one week's time,
I will return with my entire army...

1224
01:40:09,904 --> 01:40:13,157
and you will join us
against the surface world...

1225
01:40:13,324 --> 01:40:16,286
or I will wash Wakanda
from the face of the Earth.

1226
01:40:17,161 --> 01:40:18,162
Come on, my Queen.

1227
01:40:19,247 --> 01:40:20,248
Mother.

1228
01:40:20,665 --> 01:40:22,375
-Keep her back!
-Mother!

1229
01:40:22,709 --> 01:40:25,461
-Mama! Mama!
-Bury your dead.

1230
01:40:26,254 --> 01:40:27,755
Mourn your losses.

1231
01:40:31,050 --> 01:40:32,719
You are queen now.

1232
01:40:32,927 --> 01:40:33,887
Mother!

1233
01:40:34,679 --> 01:40:35,680
No!

1234
01:40:38,808 --> 01:40:40,393
Get off of me!
Mother!

1235
01:40:41,060 --> 01:40:43,021
Mama!

1236
01:40:49,777 --> 01:40:51,362
Mama!

1237
01:40:51,905 --> 01:40:53,406
Mama!

1238
01:40:53,948 --> 01:40:55,074
Mother!

1239
01:40:55,700 --> 01:40:56,784
Wake up, my Queen.

1240
01:40:58,870 --> 01:40:59,996
Let me see.

1241
01:41:00,705 --> 01:41:01,664
Wake up.

1242
01:41:02,707 --> 01:41:04,083
Help me!

1243
01:41:04,167 --> 01:41:05,418
Mama!

1244
01:41:09,005 --> 01:41:10,173
Wake up, Mother.

1245
01:41:10,840 --> 01:41:12,050
She has passed.

1246
01:41:13,009 --> 01:41:14,427
Mama!

1247
01:41:55,844 --> 01:42:01,015
Jabariland offers you their comfort
for your loss.

1248
01:42:07,647 --> 01:42:09,315
You must mourn her...

1249
01:42:09,482 --> 01:42:13,403
in accordance to the rituals
of your ancestors.

1250
01:42:15,280 --> 01:42:17,156
Do not bury yourself in your technology.

1251
01:42:17,282 --> 01:42:18,575
Why are you here?

1252
01:42:20,410 --> 01:42:22,203
I promised your brother...

1253
01:42:22,287 --> 01:42:24,581
that I would provide you with counsel...

1254
01:42:24,747 --> 01:42:26,291
and protection.

1255
01:42:28,668 --> 01:42:30,837
But I am in need of your advice today.

1256
01:42:34,799 --> 01:42:38,344
Your tribal elders have approached me
with a proposition.

1257
01:42:39,804 --> 01:42:43,057
They wish to evacuate the city
and set up camp...

1258
01:42:43,141 --> 01:42:44,726
in Jabariland.

1259
01:42:44,893 --> 01:42:48,062
So, now you are keen
to hear from a child...

1260
01:42:48,688 --> 01:42:50,398
who scoffs at tradition?

1261
01:42:54,569 --> 01:42:55,653
The world...

1262
01:42:57,530 --> 01:43:00,116
The world has taken too much from you...

1263
01:43:00,909 --> 01:43:04,162
for you to still be considered a child.

1264
01:43:07,290 --> 01:43:09,167
It is in my people's interest to know...

1265
01:43:09,334 --> 01:43:11,753
which way your mind is leaning.

1266
01:43:13,588 --> 01:43:15,423
The elders are desperate.

1267
01:43:16,925 --> 01:43:18,843
The city is vulnerable.

1268
01:43:21,095 --> 01:43:23,306
If you are to provide for them...

1269
01:43:24,432 --> 01:43:26,684
they will be in great debt to you.

1270
01:43:28,770 --> 01:43:30,438
And what of your heart?

1271
01:43:33,983 --> 01:43:35,985
Which way is your heart leaning?

1272
01:43:37,904 --> 01:43:40,782
I just buried the last person
who truly knew me.

1273
01:43:44,369 --> 01:43:45,912
My heart was buried with her.

1274
01:44:23,074 --> 01:44:24,033
Oh, man.

1275
01:44:24,909 --> 01:44:26,744
Yeah, your olive oil's about to go bad.

1276
01:44:26,995 --> 01:44:27,996
What are you doing here?

1277
01:44:28,204 --> 01:44:30,748
I'm hungry. And...

1278
01:44:31,291 --> 01:44:33,293
Tragedy strikes the international community.

1279
01:44:33,459 --> 01:44:37,589
Sources can now confirm that Queen Ramonda,
daughter of Lumumba, has died.

1280
01:44:38,089 --> 01:44:41,926
Western allies say that civil conflict
was the likely cause of the Queen's...

1281
01:44:44,345 --> 01:44:45,346
So...

1282
01:44:45,805 --> 01:44:47,182
You have any comment?

1283
01:44:49,225 --> 01:44:52,395
I wonder what else your friends
are keeping from you.

1284
01:44:53,146 --> 01:44:54,314
What are you talking about?

1285
01:44:54,480 --> 01:44:57,984
I have no unsanctioned contact
with the kingdom of Wakanda.

1286
01:45:00,403 --> 01:45:02,572
What about the Beads?

1287
01:45:03,781 --> 01:45:04,866
What?

1288
01:45:04,991 --> 01:45:05,992
The Beads.

1289
01:45:06,117 --> 01:45:07,243
I had them bugged...

1290
01:45:07,452 --> 01:45:09,120
before you ever even got there.

1291
01:45:09,245 --> 01:45:13,208
I've been privy to
every conversation you've had...

1292
01:45:13,291 --> 01:45:15,877
including that treasonous call
with the Queen.

1293
01:45:16,127 --> 01:45:17,378
May she rest in peace.

1294
01:45:17,795 --> 01:45:19,214
But it's good.

1295
01:45:19,380 --> 01:45:20,423
Well, for us.

1296
01:45:20,590 --> 01:45:23,259
All right. You know what?
The Wakandans saved my life.

1297
01:45:23,718 --> 01:45:24,761
They're a good people.

1298
01:45:25,470 --> 01:45:27,514
You ever thought for a second...

1299
01:45:27,680 --> 01:45:29,265
what they could be doing?

1300
01:45:29,474 --> 01:45:30,808
Ever thought what we would be doing...

1301
01:45:31,017 --> 01:45:34,103
if the US was the only country in the world
with vibranium?

1302
01:45:35,438 --> 01:45:38,691
I actually dream about that.

1303
01:45:41,486 --> 01:45:43,238
Val. Val, please.

1304
01:45:43,530 --> 01:45:45,198
It's Director de Fontaine.

1305
01:45:48,076 --> 01:45:51,246
Your mother protected me
like I was one of her own.

1306
01:45:52,622 --> 01:45:54,999
The least that I could do
is try to return the favor.

1307
01:45:57,293 --> 01:45:59,796
We need to find a way to weaken Namor.

1308
01:45:59,963 --> 01:46:02,131
Even weakened,
he's still gonna be a problem.

1309
01:46:02,298 --> 01:46:05,593
The Black Panther has never
failed to protect Wakanda.

1310
01:46:06,469 --> 01:46:08,471
I thought the Black Panther was gone.

1311
01:46:18,106 --> 01:46:19,482
My brother is dead.

1312
01:46:21,192 --> 01:46:23,820
But it doesn't mean
the Black Panther is gone.

1313
01:46:41,629 --> 01:46:43,047
GRIOT?

1314
01:46:43,214 --> 01:46:45,925
Let's start by running
a comparative analysis...

1315
01:46:46,050 --> 01:46:49,637
between our attempts at creating
a synthetic Heart-Shaped Herb...

1316
01:46:52,307 --> 01:46:54,392
and the fibers from this bracelet.

1317
01:46:54,934 --> 01:46:56,186
Yes, Princess.

1318
01:46:59,522 --> 01:47:02,275
Since this was grown
from vibranium-rich soil...

1319
01:47:03,526 --> 01:47:06,905
they may share some base-level similarities
that we can exploit.

1320
01:47:07,113 --> 01:47:08,406
As you wish, Princess.

1321
01:47:12,744 --> 01:47:15,163
Please upload my brother's DNA also.

1322
01:47:15,246 --> 01:47:16,372
Uploading now.

1323
01:47:47,987 --> 01:47:49,364
Why doesn't he look like them?

1324
01:47:49,572 --> 01:47:51,741
His physiology is completely different.

1325
01:47:51,824 --> 01:47:54,577
None of them fly
or have pointed ears like him.

1326
01:47:54,994 --> 01:47:56,996
The women that were guarding us,
they had water over their mouths...

1327
01:47:57,163 --> 01:47:58,957
and on their necks.

1328
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:00,041
He didn't have that.

1329
01:48:00,124 --> 01:48:05,547
Several organisms don't need gills
to extract oxygen from the water, so...

1330
01:48:05,713 --> 01:48:07,340
It's like a jellyfish.

1331
01:48:07,423 --> 01:48:11,302
He just absorbs the oxygen
from his skin.

1332
01:48:12,637 --> 01:48:14,848
-It's a process called diffusion.
-Diffusion.

1333
01:48:39,247 --> 01:48:41,958
Every day that passes
without selecting the ruler...

1334
01:48:42,125 --> 01:48:43,626
is a day wasted.

1335
01:48:43,751 --> 01:48:47,088
We must deal with Namor
before he brings his warriors back here.

1336
01:48:47,213 --> 01:48:50,008
And how are we to deal with a man
with that much power?

1337
01:48:50,925 --> 01:48:52,510
In that attack,
before he took out your plane...

1338
01:48:52,760 --> 01:48:54,053
he jumped back into the water.

1339
01:48:54,179 --> 01:48:55,930
What if that's what makes him strong?

1340
01:48:56,139 --> 01:48:59,559
He's breathing air and getting oxygen
from the water on his skin.

1341
01:48:59,767 --> 01:49:03,021
If we could find a way to dry his ass out,
he won't be as strong.

1342
01:49:03,396 --> 01:49:04,564
Yo, that's it.

1343
01:49:04,689 --> 01:49:05,690
GRIOT.

1344
01:49:05,773 --> 01:49:09,569
We need to convert the Royal Talon Fighter
into a pervaporation chamber.

1345
01:49:09,736 --> 01:49:10,820
Is that even possible?

1346
01:49:10,987 --> 01:49:12,071
Yes.

1347
01:49:13,656 --> 01:49:15,533
You're going to help us trap him.

1348
01:49:16,326 --> 01:49:18,328
Please show Miss Williams
where she's working.

1349
01:49:18,536 --> 01:49:20,163
Right this way.

1350
01:49:23,958 --> 01:49:26,461
How old were you
when you built your first machine?

1351
01:49:26,628 --> 01:49:27,629
Three.

1352
01:49:27,795 --> 01:49:31,382
My stepdad was a car mechanic.
He wanted to build airplanes.

1353
01:49:31,549 --> 01:49:33,885
He gave me these tools
and let me just work it out.

1354
01:49:37,931 --> 01:49:40,183
So who taught you how to do
all that you do?

1355
01:49:40,475 --> 01:49:41,768
My big brother.

1356
01:49:44,771 --> 01:49:48,149
I was the tip of the spear
of Wakanda's army.

1357
01:49:48,316 --> 01:49:50,652
This is not me.

1358
01:49:51,236 --> 01:49:53,363
Besides, I'm a civilian now.

1359
01:49:54,489 --> 01:49:55,782
I turned in my weapon.

1360
01:49:56,491 --> 01:49:58,117
I built you a new spear as well.

1361
01:49:59,953 --> 01:50:01,037
A new one?

1362
01:50:01,120 --> 01:50:02,163
Yes.

1363
01:50:03,540 --> 01:50:06,000
What is this contraption's name anyway?

1364
01:50:06,125 --> 01:50:07,502
The Midnight Angel.

1365
01:50:07,710 --> 01:50:09,170
Midnight Angel?

1366
01:50:09,295 --> 01:50:11,089
Listen to me.

1367
01:50:12,173 --> 01:50:14,384
This will even the odds against them.

1368
01:50:14,509 --> 01:50:16,886
Sister, I need you to
be ready when I call you.

1369
01:50:18,721 --> 01:50:19,931
Please.

1370
01:50:24,602 --> 01:50:25,854
Shuri.

1371
01:50:26,437 --> 01:50:27,647
Yes.

1372
01:50:29,190 --> 01:50:30,859
How many of these did you make?

1373
01:50:32,986 --> 01:50:34,946
I looked for you at the Jabari outpost.

1374
01:50:35,113 --> 01:50:36,739
I won't be forced out of my home.

1375
01:50:36,906 --> 01:50:39,492
You have such a rebellious spirit.

1376
01:50:39,576 --> 01:50:40,994
Why did you join the Dora?

1377
01:50:42,036 --> 01:50:43,204
Why do you care?

1378
01:50:50,461 --> 01:50:53,006
I still have a lot of fight left in me.

1379
01:50:53,423 --> 01:50:56,551
Tell me, Aneka, daughter of Kyana...

1380
01:50:57,302 --> 01:50:59,429
do you still have some fight left in you?

1381
01:50:59,596 --> 01:51:02,098
What do you have in mind?

1382
01:51:26,664 --> 01:51:27,665
GRIOT...

1383
01:51:29,334 --> 01:51:30,668
what's the confidence rate?

1384
01:51:31,419 --> 01:51:33,671
98.7%, Princess.

1385
01:51:33,963 --> 01:51:37,717
Would you like me to print
the Heart-Shaped Herb?

1386
01:51:40,803 --> 01:51:43,181
Hey, Shuri.

1387
01:51:44,015 --> 01:51:46,309
Thought you'd be back in Haiti by now.

1388
01:51:47,352 --> 01:51:48,978
I'm still Wakandan, you know.

1389
01:51:52,982 --> 01:51:53,983
So...

1390
01:51:55,318 --> 01:51:58,238
this is what you've been up to.

1391
01:51:59,030 --> 01:52:00,198
Yes.

1392
01:52:00,365 --> 01:52:02,283
What you have here, now...

1393
01:52:03,576 --> 01:52:07,789
is a chance to restore Wakanda's protector.

1394
01:52:09,040 --> 01:52:13,294
It would be the greatest gift...

1395
01:52:13,670 --> 01:52:16,130
since Bashenga's discovery.

1396
01:52:21,219 --> 01:52:23,513
We'll soon find out. Come.

1397
01:52:26,641 --> 01:52:28,059
-GRIOT?
-Yes, Princess.

1398
01:52:28,142 --> 01:52:29,143
Print it.

1399
01:52:33,314 --> 01:52:35,108
How will we know if it works?

1400
01:52:35,900 --> 01:52:37,110
If it glows.

1401
01:52:46,244 --> 01:52:47,453
You did it!

1402
01:52:52,250 --> 01:52:54,669
I mean, shouldn't we be burning incense
or something?

1403
01:52:55,211 --> 01:52:58,381
Only Bast knows how the ancestors
will make it to this lab.

1404
01:53:08,725 --> 01:53:10,643
Are you sure you don't want me to bury you?

1405
01:53:10,810 --> 01:53:11,811
No.

1406
01:53:12,353 --> 01:53:14,397
Need you to have access to my chest...

1407
01:53:14,564 --> 01:53:16,649
just in case I go through cardiac arrest.

1408
01:53:17,192 --> 01:53:18,735
"Cardiac arrest"?

1409
01:53:19,819 --> 01:53:20,862
She's joking...

1410
01:53:21,404 --> 01:53:22,655
right?

1411
01:53:24,657 --> 01:53:25,658
Right?

1412
01:53:30,580 --> 01:53:34,501
Allow this Heart-Shaped Herb...

1413
01:53:34,792 --> 01:53:37,921
to give you the strength
of the Black Panther...

1414
01:53:38,296 --> 01:53:40,757
and take you to the Ancestral Plane.

1415
01:53:43,176 --> 01:53:44,552
Ramonda.

1416
01:53:45,011 --> 01:53:50,016
We beg of you, come to your daughter.

1417
01:55:00,044 --> 01:55:01,045
Mother?

1418
01:55:14,392 --> 01:55:15,643
N'Jadaka.

1419
01:55:16,186 --> 01:55:17,353
Lil' cousin.

1420
01:55:17,770 --> 01:55:18,771
How?

1421
01:55:18,980 --> 01:55:21,649
How is never as important as why, right?

1422
01:55:23,443 --> 01:55:24,652
You chose me.

1423
01:55:24,861 --> 01:55:27,739
Impossible. I would never choose you.

1424
01:55:27,906 --> 01:55:29,532
Why did you take the Herb?

1425
01:55:30,533 --> 01:55:31,534
To see my family.

1426
01:55:31,618 --> 01:55:32,619
No, that's bullshit.

1427
01:55:33,578 --> 01:55:36,539
You didn't believe the Ancestral Plane
was real, did you?

1428
01:55:39,667 --> 01:55:40,668
No.

1429
01:55:41,377 --> 01:55:42,670
So, why did you take it, then?

1430
01:55:44,339 --> 01:55:45,715
You don't have to lie to me.

1431
01:55:46,549 --> 01:55:48,092
So I can be strong.

1432
01:55:48,384 --> 01:55:49,969
Strong to do what?

1433
01:55:52,805 --> 01:55:53,848
See?

1434
01:55:55,391 --> 01:55:57,352
We're more alike than you think.

1435
01:55:59,270 --> 01:56:01,189
I took it to avenge my ancestors too.

1436
01:56:01,397 --> 01:56:02,565
I'm nothing like you.

1437
01:56:03,983 --> 01:56:05,735
You took it for yourself...

1438
01:56:05,944 --> 01:56:07,445
then destroyed the rest.

1439
01:56:08,988 --> 01:56:10,156
Unworthy king...

1440
01:56:11,032 --> 01:56:12,492
afraid of being replaced.

1441
01:56:13,576 --> 01:56:14,577
Just a coward.

1442
01:56:14,702 --> 01:56:15,703
No.

1443
01:56:15,912 --> 01:56:18,498
I had the courage to do
what was necessary to change Wakanda.

1444
01:56:19,916 --> 01:56:21,376
How many people like your scientist...

1445
01:56:21,543 --> 01:56:23,878
did Wakanda protect
before I took the throne?

1446
01:56:24,921 --> 01:56:25,922
Cowards.

1447
01:56:26,089 --> 01:56:29,175
That was the Panthers
that came before me...

1448
01:56:29,342 --> 01:56:30,343
and before T'Challa.

1449
01:56:30,552 --> 01:56:32,345
Don't mention my brother.

1450
01:56:32,720 --> 01:56:34,305
You're the reason why he's dead.

1451
01:56:34,889 --> 01:56:38,142
You burnt the Herb,
left us with no protector.

1452
01:56:38,309 --> 01:56:40,478
Then Namor struck and killed my mother.

1453
01:56:40,687 --> 01:56:42,480
Their blood is on your hands.

1454
01:56:43,690 --> 01:56:44,983
That ain't on me.

1455
01:56:45,608 --> 01:56:46,943
And don't you dare...

1456
01:56:47,068 --> 01:56:48,945
take that away from your mother.

1457
01:56:49,112 --> 01:56:52,657
She sacrificed her life to protect
a young girl from the lost tribe.

1458
01:56:53,992 --> 01:56:56,661
Your father, he was a hypocrite.

1459
01:56:58,162 --> 01:56:59,956
He would've killed that girl.

1460
01:57:00,623 --> 01:57:02,542
Shit, he killed his own brother.

1461
01:57:04,169 --> 01:57:06,754
T'Challa was too noble.

1462
01:57:08,965 --> 01:57:11,342
He let the man who murdered your father live.

1463
01:57:13,469 --> 01:57:15,096
And here you stand.

1464
01:57:20,810 --> 01:57:22,937
Are you gonna be noble like your brother...

1465
01:57:23,104 --> 01:57:25,190
or take care of business...

1466
01:57:25,899 --> 01:57:27,025
like me?

1467
01:57:29,777 --> 01:57:30,778
Are you okay?

1468
01:57:32,947 --> 01:57:34,157
Are you OK?

1469
01:57:36,701 --> 01:57:37,785
Who did you see?

1470
01:57:43,291 --> 01:57:44,292
No one.

1471
01:57:47,504 --> 01:57:48,546
What's going on?

1472
01:57:49,255 --> 01:57:50,590
I failed.

1473
01:57:50,798 --> 01:57:51,716
It didn't work.

1474
01:57:51,925 --> 01:57:52,926
Hey, Shuri.

1475
01:57:56,012 --> 01:57:56,971
They abandoned me.

1476
01:57:57,180 --> 01:57:58,348
They would never do that.

1477
01:57:58,515 --> 01:58:00,016
I did everything I was supposed to do.

1478
01:58:00,183 --> 01:58:01,476
I re-created the Herb.

1479
01:58:01,643 --> 01:58:04,020
-Okay.
-I just did your stupid ritual, and for what?

1480
01:58:04,229 --> 01:58:05,730
-Relax.
-Why didn't they come for me?

1481
01:58:05,855 --> 01:58:06,940
Just relax.

1482
01:58:14,113 --> 01:58:15,365
Shit.

1483
01:58:19,661 --> 01:58:21,037
Can I get some of that too?

1484
01:58:28,503 --> 01:58:29,546
I think...

1485
01:58:31,047 --> 01:58:32,549
you're going to need a suit.

1486
01:59:04,205 --> 01:59:06,124
There are more people coming from the city.

1487
01:59:06,291 --> 01:59:07,792
They need more space.

1488
01:59:08,001 --> 01:59:09,002
So what?

1489
01:59:09,836 --> 01:59:12,172
You are visitors.

1490
01:59:12,338 --> 01:59:15,675
It is a wonder how anything gets done
with you people.

1491
01:59:41,284 --> 01:59:42,911
The princess!

1492
02:00:16,444 --> 02:00:17,820
She has done it!

1493
02:00:18,488 --> 02:00:21,533
The Black Panther lives!

1494
02:00:39,342 --> 02:00:41,803
Namor believes Wakanda is on her knees.

1495
02:00:44,264 --> 02:00:45,640
Our Queen murdered.

1496
02:00:48,226 --> 02:00:49,686
Our capital destroyed.

1497
02:00:51,437 --> 02:00:53,273
He believes we have no protector.

1498
02:00:55,233 --> 02:00:56,234
But now...

1499
02:00:57,986 --> 02:01:00,071
now is our time to strike.

1500
02:01:00,196 --> 02:01:03,825
How, when we don't even know
how to find him?

1501
02:01:04,367 --> 02:01:06,160
We'll bring Namor to us.

1502
02:01:06,327 --> 02:01:07,745
-Here, again?
-No.

1503
02:01:07,996 --> 02:01:10,373
A distant location at sea.

1504
02:01:10,456 --> 02:01:11,457
All right.

1505
02:01:11,916 --> 02:01:13,501
Let's say this does work.

1506
02:01:15,837 --> 02:01:17,547
Assuming we can kill this man...

1507
02:01:17,714 --> 02:01:20,758
who can fly and is potentially
as strong as the Hulk...

1508
02:01:23,428 --> 02:01:25,889
is murdering him the right solution?

1509
02:01:26,264 --> 02:01:28,224
You were calling for his head...

1510
02:01:28,391 --> 02:01:30,810
when his only crime was intimidation.

1511
02:01:30,977 --> 02:01:32,729
What has changed, Lord M'Baku?

1512
02:01:32,937 --> 02:01:34,147
His soldiers...

1513
02:01:34,314 --> 02:01:35,899
did not call him General or King.

1514
02:01:36,065 --> 02:01:38,735
They called him K'uk'ulkan.

1515
02:01:38,902 --> 02:01:40,111
What is that?

1516
02:01:40,320 --> 02:01:42,447
The feather serpent god.

1517
02:01:42,947 --> 02:01:43,948
What?

1518
02:01:44,115 --> 02:01:46,034
Do you think because
we are living in the mountains...

1519
02:01:46,201 --> 02:01:48,119
we do not have access to books?

1520
02:01:48,620 --> 02:01:49,954
Elders...

1521
02:01:50,246 --> 02:01:51,664
with your permission...

1522
02:01:51,915 --> 02:01:55,502
I would like to talk
with Lord M'Baku alone.

1523
02:01:56,461 --> 02:01:57,420
Yes.

1524
02:01:57,795 --> 02:01:58,796
Yes.

1525
02:02:05,762 --> 02:02:06,971
Namor's not finished.

1526
02:02:08,473 --> 02:02:11,559
He promised to destroy the surface world.

1527
02:02:11,726 --> 02:02:14,062
Now is our opportunity to take him.

1528
02:02:14,187 --> 02:02:16,439
-What are you afraid of?
-War.

1529
02:02:16,898 --> 02:02:20,235
If Namor is indeed a god to his people...

1530
02:02:20,360 --> 02:02:23,029
killing him will risk eternal war.

1531
02:02:23,196 --> 02:02:24,280
And so what?

1532
02:02:24,739 --> 02:02:27,116
Was my mother's life not worth eternal war?

1533
02:02:27,325 --> 02:02:28,618
Of course it was.

1534
02:02:29,744 --> 02:02:33,831
Of course she was.

1535
02:02:35,834 --> 02:02:39,045
But it is not what she would
have wanted for you.

1536
02:02:44,342 --> 02:02:46,135
And it is not what I want...

1537
02:02:48,721 --> 02:02:50,598
for my people.

1538
02:03:00,900 --> 02:03:03,945
You speak of my mother
as if she's still here.

1539
02:03:04,863 --> 02:03:06,865
Of what she would've wanted for me.

1540
02:03:07,949 --> 02:03:10,285
Her hopes and her dreams.

1541
02:03:13,413 --> 02:03:14,831
But she's dead.

1542
02:03:15,874 --> 02:03:16,875
She's gone!

1543
02:03:18,710 --> 02:03:22,589
Namor drowned her, right in front of me!

1544
02:03:23,923 --> 02:03:25,175
So, her dreams...

1545
02:03:25,341 --> 02:03:28,428
her goals, her hopes for me...

1546
02:03:31,848 --> 02:03:33,099
it doesn't exist.

1547
02:03:35,768 --> 02:03:37,353
It doesn't matter anymore.

1548
02:03:39,439 --> 02:03:42,317
What matters is what I want...

1549
02:03:42,483 --> 02:03:45,153
and what I want is Namor dead!

1550
02:03:49,115 --> 02:03:51,826
And you're going to help me get it.

1551
02:03:58,333 --> 02:03:59,501
Are we clear?

1552
02:04:07,050 --> 02:04:08,760
We leave in the morning.

1553
02:04:34,577 --> 02:04:35,578
Hi.

1554
02:04:35,787 --> 02:04:36,746
Good morning.

1555
02:04:39,290 --> 02:04:40,583
If we survive this...

1556
02:04:42,168 --> 02:04:45,380
I want you to know
you have a home with me in Haiti.

1557
02:04:48,299 --> 02:04:50,510
Here. Take my hands.

1558
02:04:53,847 --> 02:04:54,848
Breathe.

1559
02:04:59,227 --> 02:05:01,813
Shuri, I want you to be honest with me.

1560
02:05:01,896 --> 02:05:04,983
Who did you see when you took the Herb?

1561
02:05:10,196 --> 02:05:11,906
If you go to war for vengeance...

1562
02:05:12,073 --> 02:05:14,409
it will not fill the hole left from her loss.

1563
02:05:15,076 --> 02:05:16,911
It will only grow larger...

1564
02:05:17,120 --> 02:05:18,580
and it will consume you.

1565
02:05:20,748 --> 02:05:22,125
It already has.

1566
02:05:27,630 --> 02:05:34,220
K'uk'ulkan, another machine to
detect vibranium is in use in the ocean.

1567
02:05:35,221 --> 02:05:36,222
Where?

1568
02:06:05,668 --> 02:06:06,836
Get out of the water!

1569
02:06:51,506 --> 02:06:52,799
For the Queen.

1570
02:08:06,915 --> 02:08:08,625
Riri, how's it going up there?

1571
02:08:09,209 --> 02:08:10,418
Hey, Mr. GRIOT.

1572
02:08:10,543 --> 02:08:11,920
I could really use that backup right now.

1573
02:08:12,128 --> 02:08:14,047
I thought you'd never ask.

1574
02:08:19,928 --> 02:08:20,929
Shit.

1575
02:08:25,308 --> 02:08:26,726
Shit, he's fast.

1576
02:08:27,352 --> 02:08:28,603
But I'm faster.

1577
02:08:48,581 --> 02:08:49,624
I got you.

1578
02:08:55,964 --> 02:08:57,340
It's on you now, Shuri.

1579
02:09:06,558 --> 02:09:08,142
-Princess.
-No.

1580
02:09:08,351 --> 02:09:11,896
I am the Black Panther,
and I'm here for retribution!

1581
02:09:12,480 --> 02:09:15,483
Pervaporation cells activated.

1582
02:09:24,951 --> 02:09:25,952
What's wrong?

1583
02:09:26,744 --> 02:09:27,996
You need a glass of water?

1584
02:09:31,958 --> 02:09:33,042
Yo, we got him.

1585
02:09:33,126 --> 02:09:34,836
-Good!
-Namor has been captured.

1586
02:09:35,128 --> 02:09:36,296
Retreat back!

1587
02:09:41,259 --> 02:09:42,677
Back to Wakanda!

1588
02:09:48,474 --> 02:09:49,475
Move out!

1589
02:10:14,542 --> 02:10:15,710
What is going on?

1590
02:10:16,544 --> 02:10:18,421
The sonic emitter has been destroyed.

1591
02:10:40,610 --> 02:10:42,111
That can't be good.

1592
02:11:14,185 --> 02:11:16,354
Panther, the Sea Leopard has lost power...

1593
02:11:16,563 --> 02:11:18,523
and they are experiencing
significant casualties.

1594
02:11:20,108 --> 02:11:21,067
Okoye.

1595
02:11:21,276 --> 02:11:22,569
Panther.

1596
02:11:23,611 --> 02:11:24,737
Aneka.

1597
02:11:25,989 --> 02:11:26,990
Okoye.

1598
02:11:27,156 --> 02:11:28,408
It is time.

1599
02:11:39,252 --> 02:11:40,295
For Wakanda!

1600
02:11:41,087 --> 02:11:42,297
Wakanda!

1601
02:11:50,638 --> 02:11:52,307
GRIOT, what's the damage?

1602
02:11:52,432 --> 02:11:54,684
Catastrophic. His spear is
made of raw vibranium.

1603
02:11:54,809 --> 02:11:57,270
-The ship could explode at any second.
-Get us to the desert.

1604
02:12:16,080 --> 02:12:17,081
No!

1605
02:12:45,735 --> 02:12:47,237
Sink the ship!

1606
02:13:14,848 --> 02:13:15,849
I got you, sis.

1607
02:13:16,015 --> 02:13:17,016
Hold on.

1608
02:14:21,247 --> 02:14:22,665
Warrior!

1609
02:14:26,085 --> 02:14:28,379
You speak the mother tongue?

1610
02:14:28,713 --> 02:14:31,090
You can greet your ancestors with it...

1611
02:15:01,162 --> 02:15:02,455
Get off me!

1612
02:15:14,384 --> 02:15:15,677
All right, come here.

1613
02:15:18,972 --> 02:15:22,350
You will greet your ancestors.

1614
02:15:46,332 --> 02:15:47,876
May the ancestors save us...

1615
02:15:48,126 --> 02:15:49,627
if the princess does not hurry.

1616
02:15:49,794 --> 02:15:51,588
We may be going to join them.

1617
02:15:52,463 --> 02:15:53,548
If so, hey...

1618
02:15:53,673 --> 02:15:55,884
let us take as many of them with us
as we can.

1619
02:16:25,997 --> 02:16:27,415
It could've been different.

1620
02:16:32,128 --> 02:16:33,505
I need water.

1621
02:16:50,271 --> 02:16:52,398
Are you gonna be noble like your brother...

1622
02:16:52,607 --> 02:16:53,983
or take care of business...

1623
02:16:54,067 --> 02:16:55,109
like me?

1624
02:16:55,276 --> 02:16:56,903
I'm not my brother.

1625
02:16:58,279 --> 02:17:00,365
Namor will beg me for mercy...

1626
02:17:00,990 --> 02:17:03,493
as I stand and watch as he dies.

1627
02:17:42,365 --> 02:17:44,826
Imperius Rex.

1628
02:17:47,453 --> 02:17:48,621
Wakanda forever!

1629
02:19:37,355 --> 02:19:38,857
Shuri.

1630
02:19:40,358 --> 02:19:41,359
Mama.

1631
02:19:44,279 --> 02:19:45,655
Show him...

1632
02:19:46,030 --> 02:19:47,490
who you are.

1633
02:19:54,455 --> 02:19:55,456
Yield...

1634
02:19:56,541 --> 02:19:58,877
and Wakanda will protect your oceans.

1635
02:19:59,043 --> 02:20:01,379
We will protect your secrets.

1636
02:20:01,588 --> 02:20:02,589
Yield...

1637
02:20:03,840 --> 02:20:05,508
and your people will live.

1638
02:20:09,554 --> 02:20:11,931
Vengeance has consumed us.

1639
02:20:12,265 --> 02:20:15,018
We cannot let it consume our people.

1640
02:20:23,735 --> 02:20:25,570
I yield.

1641
02:20:50,553 --> 02:20:52,764
Talokanile'ex!

1642
02:20:54,641 --> 02:20:56,059
Let us return home.

1643
02:20:56,726 --> 02:20:58,102
Our fight here is done.

1644
02:21:10,990 --> 02:21:12,825
Wakanda forever!

1645
02:21:13,368 --> 02:21:14,869
Wakanda forever!

1646
02:21:59,289 --> 02:22:00,748
Thank you, my love.

1647
02:22:24,647 --> 02:22:25,732
Yo.

1648
02:22:30,278 --> 02:22:31,446
All set to head home?

1649
02:22:31,613 --> 02:22:34,073
As long as you're sure the police
won't be waiting for me at the airport.

1650
02:22:34,282 --> 02:22:35,950
Don't worry. Took care of that.

1651
02:22:36,117 --> 02:22:39,704
But you might want to slow down
on your homework-for-hire business.

1652
02:22:39,913 --> 02:22:42,248
Get caught slipping,
I can't help you with that.

1653
02:22:43,416 --> 02:22:45,376
They said you wanted
to talk to me about something?

1654
02:22:45,502 --> 02:22:46,503
Yes.

1655
02:22:46,753 --> 02:22:49,964
Your suit.
It's a great design...

1656
02:22:50,632 --> 02:22:51,758
but can't let you leave with it.

1657
02:22:51,925 --> 02:22:53,134
It's all good.

1658
02:22:53,343 --> 02:22:56,262
Figured the least I could do
is help Wakanda clean up my mess.

1659
02:22:57,597 --> 02:22:59,015
I have one more thing to show you.

1660
02:22:59,474 --> 02:23:00,475
Come.

1661
02:23:04,479 --> 02:23:07,565
Took me a while to find
all the parts from the river...

1662
02:23:07,732 --> 02:23:09,150
but it was worth it.

1663
02:23:09,776 --> 02:23:10,777
How did you...

1664
02:23:12,153 --> 02:23:13,613
It's my dad's car.

1665
02:23:14,906 --> 02:23:16,658
We used to work on it before...

1666
02:23:22,622 --> 02:23:24,457
-You sure this is her?
-Every part.

1667
02:23:24,666 --> 02:23:26,125
Have it shipped to Boston.

1668
02:23:26,209 --> 02:23:27,502
Be there before you arrive.

1669
02:23:33,216 --> 02:23:34,217
Bring it in, man.

1670
02:23:37,637 --> 02:23:41,933
Panther, Miss Williams' transport
has arrived.

1671
02:23:42,684 --> 02:23:44,102
Look after yourself.

1672
02:23:44,519 --> 02:23:46,938
Sure you're not trying to slide to Chicago?

1673
02:23:47,021 --> 02:23:48,106
Catch a Bulls game?

1674
02:23:49,357 --> 02:23:53,903
Sounds fun, but I have something
I need to take care of.

1675
02:24:18,553 --> 02:24:21,139
And now I present to you...

1676
02:24:21,264 --> 02:24:22,432
Princess Shuri...

1677
02:24:22,515 --> 02:24:23,850
the Black Panther!

1678
02:24:42,285 --> 02:24:45,205
The Black Panther sends her regards...

1679
02:24:45,997 --> 02:24:47,957
but she will not be joining us today.

1680
02:24:49,125 --> 02:24:51,044
I, M'Baku...

1681
02:24:51,252 --> 02:24:53,713
leader of the Jabari Tribe...

1682
02:24:53,880 --> 02:24:55,465
son of Wakanda...

1683
02:24:56,841 --> 02:24:58,718
wish to challenge...

1684
02:24:59,802 --> 02:25:00,887
for the throne.

1685
02:25:06,559 --> 02:25:08,269
What is troubling you, my child?

1686
02:25:10,146 --> 02:25:17,111
I looked forward to fighting
alongside you my entire life...

1687
02:25:18,071 --> 02:25:23,159
The thought of you
kneeling to the Wakandans...

1688
02:25:23,576 --> 02:25:28,331
The Black Panther
had every reason to kill me.

1689
02:25:29,165 --> 02:25:32,293
Why do you think
she didn't go through with it?

1690
02:25:34,212 --> 02:25:38,633
The Black Panther is the most powerful person

1691
02:25:39,008 --> 02:25:44,806
in the most powerful nation on the surface.

1692
02:25:44,973 --> 02:25:47,976
But she has no allies.

1693
02:25:48,393 --> 02:25:53,022
Now she has empathy
for the people of Talokan.

1694
02:25:54,858 --> 02:25:56,943
With this alliance...

1695
02:25:57,610 --> 02:26:04,659
Talokan will be stronger than ever.

1696
02:26:05,076 --> 02:26:08,913
The surface world will come for Wakanda

1697
02:26:09,831 --> 02:26:12,709
and Wakanda will turn to us.

1698
02:26:14,335 --> 02:26:16,004
Trust me.

1699
02:26:32,729 --> 02:26:33,897
What the hell is this?

1700
02:26:34,105 --> 02:26:35,315
Can we turn around?

1701
02:26:36,983 --> 02:26:38,943
I don't know, man. We'll lose an hour.

1702
02:26:40,320 --> 02:26:41,779
Why don't you go check it out?

1703
02:26:41,905 --> 02:26:43,114
Okay.

1704
02:26:45,950 --> 02:26:47,243
Yeah, this is Shauver.

1705
02:26:47,619 --> 02:26:49,621
Yeah, looks like we got
a tree blocking our way.

1706
02:26:49,787 --> 02:26:51,581
How do you want us to proceed?

1707
02:26:52,040 --> 02:26:53,041
What the...

1708
02:27:05,094 --> 02:27:07,347
A colonizer in chains.

1709
02:27:08,097 --> 02:27:10,183
Now I have seen everything.

1710
02:27:10,350 --> 02:27:11,351
Funny.

1711
02:27:12,101 --> 02:27:13,144
Let's go.

1712
02:27:39,879 --> 02:27:40,880
Thank you.

1713
02:27:40,964 --> 02:27:41,965
You're welcome.

1714
02:27:46,928 --> 02:27:47,929
Hey.

1715
02:27:49,264 --> 02:27:50,890
Welcome!

1716
02:27:52,684 --> 02:27:54,102
It's good to see you.

1717
02:27:54,853 --> 02:27:56,062
Everything is ready.

1718
02:27:56,229 --> 02:27:57,564
Just give me one moment, eh?

1719
02:27:57,730 --> 02:27:59,107
Actually...

1720
02:27:59,274 --> 02:28:01,109
I think I should do it on my own.

1721
02:28:02,360 --> 02:28:03,695
Of course.

1722
02:32:38,761 --> 02:32:39,762
Shuri...

1723
02:32:41,014 --> 02:32:42,807
can we join you now?

1724
02:32:45,894 --> 02:32:48,938
This is my son, Toussaint.

1725
02:32:50,106 --> 02:32:51,107
Toussaint...

1726
02:32:51,691 --> 02:32:54,819
this is your aunty, Shuri.

1727
02:32:56,321 --> 02:32:57,322
Hi.

1728
02:33:18,259 --> 02:33:20,845
We agreed it was better for him
to grow up here.

1729
02:33:21,095 --> 02:33:24,182
Away from the pressure of the throne.

1730
02:33:25,558 --> 02:33:26,768
Your father...

1731
02:33:27,393 --> 02:33:29,103
your baba...

1732
02:33:29,270 --> 02:33:31,981
prepared us for his death, didn't he?

1733
02:33:36,569 --> 02:33:38,613
But he didn't want us to go to the funeral...

1734
02:33:39,447 --> 02:33:42,408
because he felt the time was not yet right.

1735
02:33:43,159 --> 02:33:45,870
So we had our own ceremony for him here.

1736
02:33:47,664 --> 02:33:49,249
Did my mother meet him?

1737
02:33:49,332 --> 02:33:50,333
She did.

1738
02:33:59,968 --> 02:34:01,010
It's nice to meet you.

1739
02:34:01,219 --> 02:34:02,428
Nice to meet you.

1740
02:34:02,554 --> 02:34:04,180
Toussaint is a beautiful name.

1741
02:34:04,597 --> 02:34:06,766
It holds a great history.

1742
02:34:06,975 --> 02:34:10,270
Thanks. Yours is cool, too, I guess.

1743
02:34:13,565 --> 02:34:15,650
My mom says you are good
at keeping secrets.

1744
02:34:15,733 --> 02:34:16,818
Is that true?

1745
02:34:17,986 --> 02:34:20,864
Yes, I can keep a good secret.

1746
02:34:23,867 --> 02:34:26,202
Toussaint is my Haitian name.

1747
02:34:29,163 --> 02:34:30,331
Who are you?

1748
02:34:31,249 --> 02:34:35,461
My name is Prince T'Challa,
son of King T'Challa.
