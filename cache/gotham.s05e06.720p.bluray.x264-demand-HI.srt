<i>- Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,515
raise your glasses
to the killer

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,672
of Jeremiah Valeska.

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:08,990
(cheering)

5
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,674
A lead on a guy selling RPGs.

6
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,069
Get out of here, Barbara.

7
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,440
(gunshot)

8
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:26,959
Eduardo?

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,314
Nice shot, right?

10
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,514
Tell me what you did!

11
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,353
I put a chip in your brain.

12
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,520
Better talk, now.

13
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,074
A contract came along.

14
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,072
A contract from who?

15
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,310
(beeps)

16
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,075
Walker wants Ed Nygma
taken out now.

17
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,390
Walker was behind this?

18
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,320
She's been controlling Nygma
the whole time?

19
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,400
- (gasps)
- Ouch.

20
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,040
Stitches still sore, huh?

21
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,034
I told you I had to let
Selina thrust the knife

22
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,630
into my flesh at least once.

23
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,799
(beeps)

24
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,916
You know Jim Gordon.

25
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,156
You know this city.

26
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,914
Find him. And kill him.

27
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,357
(panting)

28
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,599

Your chances of survival
are astronomically low, James.

31
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,630
Continuing to run
is ill-advised.

Ooh, you're a handsome devil.
What's your name?

Oswald Cobblepot.

52
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,870
But I'm guessing
you already knew that.

53

Stop!

54
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,720
Penguin. Didn't think
you'd miss a couple things.

Couple things go missing
all the time.

How did you know
about this place?

57
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,999
All of the thieves I used
are dead.

58
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,435
Yep, yep.

59
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,315
Was on a job.

60
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,079
Someone got there first.

61
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,754
Followed them
back here.

62
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,798
Saw you. Bang, bang.

63
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,311
Then you know what is in store.

64
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,158
I do hope whatever you came
here for was worth your life.

(both laugh)

66
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,996
The Russifer Diamond.

67
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,870
Not Russifer. Charlotte.

68
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,040
What's in your other hand?

69
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,117
Wait, how did you...

70
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,639
(groans)

71
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,756
Bye-bye.

(panting)

73
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,477
Who the hell was that?

74
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,954
(grunts)
Oh, God...

75
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,719
Oh!
(panting)

76
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,475
Oh, God. It happened
again, didn't it?

77
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,160
What did I do?

78
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,634
You tried to kill me.

79
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,640
Oh. Is that all?

80
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,520
I need answers, Ed.

81
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,878
I know Walker gave the orders
to destroy Haven

82
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,679
and the supply helicopter.

83
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,360
What is she planning next?

84
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,520
I don't know.

85
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,517
Jim, I don't remember anything
once I go under.

86
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,630
You're bleeding.

87
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,760
You have to let me go.
I'm not responsible for this.

88
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,120
That chip in your head
could be evidence.

89
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,960
So unless you want me
to rip it out,

90
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,551
- you're coming with me.
- Okay.

91
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,720
(grunts)

92
00:05:51,721 --> 00:05:53,598
(gunfire in distance)

93
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,237

94
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,840
ALFRED:
Bruce.

95
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
There you are.

96
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,676
So, go on, then.

97
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,115
How'd it go with Selina?

98
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,119
Oh, dear.

99
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,680
Well, I am sorry, Master Bruce,
but perhaps it's for the best.

100
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,878
Maybe. That's not why I called
you here. You see this?

101
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,556
Yeah, I know, right?
Looks like Captain Gordon's

102
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,076
finally getting the help
this city so desperately needs.

103
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,636
Is he?

104
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,240
What the people desperately
need is food and medicine.

105
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,515
Not just more guns.

106
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,840
What is it?

107
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,835
No, it's just this unit.

108
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,111
Their motto is "Born of Blood."

109
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,356
You know them?

110
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,760
Yeah, by reputation only.

111
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,280
They're a horrible bunch
of bastards.

112
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,434
They specialize in military
coups, assassinations.

113
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,920
They're certainly
not the vanguard

114
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,231
for humanitarian relief.

115
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,270
Excuse me.

116
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,158
When's the supply
shipment gonna be here?

117
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,680
Supplies?

118
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,473
These people are
desperate for food,

119
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,919
clean water, medicine.

120
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,192
Oh, yeah. It's on its way.

121
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,595
Where's Captain Gordon?

122
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,200
We lost sight of Gordon.

123
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,034
But don't worry. Eduardo's out
there looking for him right now.

124
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,035
Unless you know
where we might find him?

125
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,752
Logically, he'd come here.

126
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,471
Unless there's some
reason he can't.

127
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,360
Tell you what, kiddo.

128
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,096
I'm gonna find you and your
friend a quiet place in the back

129
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,120
where you can
wait for Gordon.

130
00:07:33,121 --> 00:07:34,216
Ah, don't you worry
about it, mate.

131
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,674
We'll just catch up
with him later.

132
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,990
I insist.

133
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,280
We need to find Jim.

134
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,594
So the government is behind
Haven and the supply helicopter,

135
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,991
and they did it with a chip
in this one's head?

136
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,416
Is that really
the craziest thing

137
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,520
you've ever heard, Barbara?

138
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,840
Bruce hit me up on the radio

139
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,280
a little while ago,
looking for you.

140
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,073
Said things are amiss
in the GCPD.

141
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,996
I'll reach out, see if we
can meet up somewhere safe.

142
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,376
Can you pull in some of your
people, see if they can help?

143
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,392
No. I need them
guarding my territory.

144
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,039
But you have me.

145
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,040
And me.

146
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,390
I don't trust you.

147
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,520
With or without
that chip in your head.

148
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,600
Jim.

149
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,878
They used me as a pawn
to murder innocent people.

150
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,111
They messed with my brain.

151
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,631
The thing that I want
is revenge.

152
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,079
How do I know that chip
can't be reactivated?

153
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,416
Well, when you found
me at Strange's lab,

154
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,636
he was fixing it after a...

155
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,880
car battery mishap...

156
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,640
I-It's safe to say
that I think you shorted it out.

157
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,760
Let me look at that.

158
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,799
- What?
- Your neck.

159
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,718
That's gonna need stitches.
I have a first aid kit.

160
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,880
I need to keep moving.
Just name your fee.

161
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,600
Can't I just want to help?

162
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,839
Not you, not usually.

163
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,176
Friend of mine just
tried to kill me.

164
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,736
I don't want anyone else
waiting for an excuse

165
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,936
- to stab me in the back.
- I gave you Gerry the Jerkwad,

166
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,553
and I'm letting you
hide out in my club.

167
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,110
If I wanted to betray you,
I would have done it earlier.

168
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,874
So, where's that first aid kit?

169
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,557
Gonna make myself useful.

170
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,672
What's it gonna take
for you to trust me?

171
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,509
After everything you've done,
I honestly don't know.

172
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,078
EDUARDO:
I'd listen to her, Jim.

173
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:37,150
I hear trust is in short supply.

174
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,355
EDUARDO: You forget your
PSYOPS training, Jim?

175
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,519
Lesson one: when a person
is in trouble,

176
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,439
they go to a familiar place.

177
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,119
Your ex-fiancée's bar was
just a stone's throw away,

178
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,080
so it's nice to finally
meet you, Barbara.

179
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,520
Screw you.

180
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,800
Hmm.

181
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,517
It seems
you've lost your tail.

182
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,874
You mean the psychopath

183
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,434
you ordered to kill me?

184
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,033
You had your chance.

185
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,991
It could have been
like old times, buddy.

186
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,560
You, me, together,

187
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,430
making the world a better place.

188
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,799
- By murdering civilians?
- Civilians?

189
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,233
This hellhole is infested
with criminals and terrorists.

190
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,831
Sometimes you just have
to clean house, you know?

191
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,270
I won't let you.

192
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,114
It's not your call, Jim.

193
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,839
(guns clicking)

194
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,760
I'm not dead yet.

195
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,110
James Gordon,
I've been ordered to kill you.

196
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,835
Well, looks like you haven't
lost that tail after all.

197
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,680
(straining):
If I die,

198
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,120
you'll never get the evidence!

199
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,400
Stand down.

200
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,276
I have evidence that you
and Walker are behind Haven.

201
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,999
If I die, it gets out
to the entire country.

202
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,479
It's time to make a deal.

203
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,960
You don't have any evidence.

204
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,278
Is that a risk
you're willing to take?

205
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,640
It is.

206
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,310
Nygma, kill them both.

207
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,557
(bell tolling in distance)

208
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,274
(screaming)

209
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,240
(door closes)

210
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,160
Bad time?

211
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,319
(sighs) What
do you want?

212
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,275
Depends.

213
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,590
What did <i>they</i> want?

214
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,120
Oh. A shot at me.

215
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,833
I killed Jeremiah Valeska.

216
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,830
(laughs softly)

217
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,754
So the rumors are true.

218
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,555
Yeah.

219
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,794
And now, every scumbag in town
wants to take me down

220
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,633
to make a name
for themselves.

221
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,678
So I got to find a new squat.

222
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,394
How about, in exchange
for helping me find someone,

223
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,357
I let you crash in my citadel?

224
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,439
It's seen better days, but...

225
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,553
(laughs):
...then again, right?

226
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,920
Who?

227
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,960
A miscreant I caught in the act
of stealing from me.

228
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,159
She was going to replace
the stolen item

229
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,075
with an exact replica,
except the replica was a bomb.

230
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,391
- (chuckles)
- Ring any bells?

231
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,154
White hair, feathered collar,

232
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,039
kind of of resembles
a goth chicken?

233
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,475
You do know her.

234
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,196
(chuckles)

235
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,592
She goes by the name Magpie.

236
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,480
What'd she steal?

237
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,795
The Russifer Diamond.

238
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,191
What makes you think
I would help you

239
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,509
after you
killed Tabitha

240
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,160
in cold blood?

241
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,231
Because you believe
in an eye for an eye.

242
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,512
Hard as it may be to swallow,

243
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,033
Tabitha made her bed
when she killed my mother.

244
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,676
Tell you what.

245
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,752
I will help you

246
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,839
if I get to keep the diamond.

247
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,836
(laughs)

248
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,320
What?

249
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,869
Not a chance.

250
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,315
Ha, ha, ha.
Then you'll never find her.

251
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:16,398
And every person in Gotham
will think it's okay

252
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,358
to steal from Penguin.

253
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,039
Is that what you want?

254
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,080
You know me too well.

255
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,430
Fine.

256
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,270
Good.

257
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,256
- What happened?
- EDUARDO: I want every soldier

258
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,953
in the field looking
for Jim Gordon.

259
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,590
Sir, we maxed out
the holding cells.

260
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,156
We may need to keep men here
to control the overflow.

261
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,192
Ethan, Sumiko.

262
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,434
We're moving to phase two.

263
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,559
(grunts)

264
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,915
What in the hell's going on?

265
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,320
Listen up.

266
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,632
I am not here to play nice.

267
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,440
I am not here
to hold anyone's hand.

268
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,115
I am here on a simple mission.

269
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,916
Any questions about the nature
of that mission?

270
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,551
Are you insane?
You can't just execute people.

271
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,190
Do not question me.

272
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,192
This is the mission.
If you don't like it,

273
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,158
you'll be locked up,
you'll remain locked up,

274
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,993
until we purge
the criminal element

275
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,640
from the streets of Gotham.

276
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,795
Sir, Secretary Walker's
on the radio.

277
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,235
(cell door closes)

278
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,911
We've moved on to phase two,
but we've lost track

279
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,673
of Gordon and Nygma.

280
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,960
I think Gordon found a way
to fry the chip.

281
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,840
WALKER:
We can't have Nygma

282
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,031
in the wind with all that
evidence in his head.

283
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,277
Just trust me.
Once we find them...

284
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,590
Don't bother.

285
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,794
I have an idea that will bring
Jim Gordon and Nygma to us.

286
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,674
Thanks for getting
everyone here.

287
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,600
And for the Wayne R and D.

288
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,759
Are you sure about including
Barbara Kean and Ed Nygma?

289
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,278
War makes
for strange bedfellows.

290
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,576
It's good to have
a friend nearby, Bruce.

291
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,910
Ow! Would you be careful?

292
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,976
If you'll stop moving,
this will go a lot faster.

293
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,776
NYGMA: Well, if you would be
more careful, I wouldn't potato

294
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,678
all the long legs
from the hidden spoon.

295
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,200
What just happened?

296
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,721
I believe the chip is installed
against his speech center.

297
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,793
Huh. Do it again.

298
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,591
The human brain is not
a plaything, Ms. Kean.

299
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,231
Please don't habituate
the curtain rod.

300
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,760
(chuckles)

301
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,680
And... ah.

302
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,440
Stay.

303
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,475
There. How does that feel?

304
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,840
(grunts)

305
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,720
Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers.

306
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,594
Oh, God.
Thank you, Lucius.

307
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,718
LUCIUS: So what exactly
are we looking for?

308
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,999
Anything tying Walker or Eduardo
to the destruction of Haven.

309
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,039
Why would Walker
kill all those people?

310
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,073
That's what we
have to find out.

311
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,395
Oh, yes.

312
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,280
It appears the chip
retains an audio log

313
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,034
of every verbal communication
with Nygma while he was under.

314
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,676
There's some damage, but...

315
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,600
if the command to attack
Haven is still here,

316
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,856
I can trace it back
to the computer

317
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,880
from which it originated.

318
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,315
It has to be Walker.

319
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,595
They won't be able to sweep
this under the rug anymore.

320
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,633
Are you out there, Jim?

321
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,475
What do you want?

322
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,079
We have someone here...

323
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,917
...who wants
to say hello.

324
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,590
THOMPKINS:
J-Jim? What's happening?

325
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,040
Lee?

326
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,920
We found the Queen
of the Narrows

327
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,192
in a run-down hidey-hole
on the north side. Tell me,

328
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,558
how many ex-fiancées
do you have, anyway?

329
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,560
Leave her out of this.
She's not involved.

330
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,400
Ah, but she's a criminal,
and all criminals in Gotham

331
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,313
are now under a death sentence.

332
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,960
But what happens next
is up to you.

333
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,754
A trade, perhaps.

334
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,273
Lee Thompkins for Ed Nygma.

335
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,475
Fine.

336
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,754
Good. Bring Nygma
to the GCPD now.

337
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,550
No, we meet at Haven.

338
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,791
I want you to see
the carnage you've caused.

339
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,594
Always so emotional.

340
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,719
That's not how wars
are won, Jim.

341
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,593
Those are my terms.
Take it or leave it.

342
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,752
(radio crackles)

343
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,393
Okay. I'll play your game.

344
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,389
What are you doing?

345
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,433
He's never gonna
let you walk out of there.

346
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,593
I don't recall volunteering
as a trading chit!

347
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,837
He doesn't want Ed.
He wants the chip.

348
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,071
So I'll give him
the chip. Bruce,

349
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,320
do you have any contacts
in the mainland press?

350
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,480
Several.

351
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,976
What would it take to broadcast
the information from the chip

352
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,071
- to the mainland?
- A transmitter, which I have,

353
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,516
and a very large antenna,
which I do not.

354
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,896
I know where there's an antenna
in the Green Zone,

355
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,080
but you're not gonna like it.

356
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,952
The roof of the GCPD.

357
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,840
(whispering):
Lee.

358
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,480
- Harvey.
- Where the hell have you been?

359
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,715
You've been gone for months.

360
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,156
I don't know.

361
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,630
I can't remember anything.

362
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,235
What happened to me?

363
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,359
I don't know.
We're gonna figure it out.

364
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,720
I promise.

365
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,040
Let's go.

366
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,874
BULLOCK:
It's gonna be okay.

367
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,280
(beeping, clicking)

368
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,816
GORDON (over radio):
Eduardo just arrived.

369
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,230
He brought backup,
like we expected. Time to move.

370
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,400
Copy that.

371
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,400
Let's go.

372
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,511
(birds squawking)

373
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,560
THOMPKINS:
Jim!

374
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,154
Who are these people?

375
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,472
I'm gonna get you
out of here, Lee.

376
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,999
I'm not sure that's true, Jim.

377
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,393
It seems you forgot
to bring someone.

378
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,309
It's hard to make a swap
when you have nothing to trade.

379
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,315
We both know this
is really what you want.

380
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,112
Proof that you and Walker
are responsible

381
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,680
for the destruction of Haven

382
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,991
and the murder of hundreds
of innocent people.

383
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,950
Now let her go.

384
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,434
Let me guess, you made a copy

385
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,115
so you can do this little bit
of theatrics for me.

386
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,834
I expected more from you, Jim.

387
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,240
Three soldiers against one man
without a gun.

388
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,278
You sure you brought
enough help?

389
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,069
I don't need any help.

390
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,035
Is that why you sent Nygma
to do your dirty work?

391
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,910
So he could pick up your slack
like I used to?

392
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,551
Still dining out on pulling me
from that burning truck.

393
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,079
I carried more
than my fair share.

394
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,754
I was always the first man in.

395
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,917
Your recklessness
got people killed.

396
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,072
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

397
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,280
Ramirez?

398
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,439
No.

399
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,440
Johnson.

400
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,920
Bolton.

401
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,674
Their deaths were not on me.

402
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,080
Yeah.

403
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,240
Put a bullet in my mouth

404
00:21:15,241 --> 00:21:16,435
and shut me up.

405
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,560
No.

406
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,515
Not a bullet.

407
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,038
But I am gonna shut your mouth.

408
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,195
Once and for all.

409
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,280
Come try.

410
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,994
(creaking)

411
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,736
You sure this
is the place?

412
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,760
Yep.

413
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,273
This is the place.

414
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,876
Stop her!

415
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,111
Ouchie. You're quick.

416
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,394
I know you?

417
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,316
- Doubt it.
- Uh-huh.

418
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,792
You killed Jeremiah.
You're famous.

419
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,151
(laughs)
Not so scary.

420
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,595
I could be famous.

421
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,360
You want a shot at me, too?

422
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,758
Unfortunately, you won't
have the opportunity.

423
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,680
Careful.

424
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,155
This is my workshop

425
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,233
where I make my boom-booms.

426
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,154
Anything here, boom, boom.
Then more boom

427
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,277
and more boom,
then the whole room...

428
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,797
- Boom, boom. We get it.
- You're bluffing.

429
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,960
Catch.

430
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,354
Ooh! No, no!

431
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,038
- (watch ticking)
- MAGPIE: Whoops!

432
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,193
(laughs) That watch
must have been an original,

433
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,596
but other stuff
in there, boom, boom.

434
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,195
Good luck.

435
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,554
We tie our
shoelaces together,

436
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,632
then we lasso the keys
off the desk.

437
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:10,271
And then what, Roy Rogers, huh?
They surrender in awe?

438
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,115
No harebrained scheme is
gonna get us out of here.

439
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,635
Hello!

440
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,798
Hope you don't mind, I...

441
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,472
borrowed some cop stuff
from the garage.

442
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,951
Oh, boy, you can
put your guns down.

443
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,874
Kevlar in this thing
is designed to withstand a blast

444
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,356
that can tear down a building
twice this size.

445
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,880
What is that?

446
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,914
Is it not obvious?

447
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,560
It's a bomb!

448
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,231
Okay.

449
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,114
Let's play a game.

450
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,359
- Clear out.
- Ah, ah, ah, ah.

451
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,310
If anyone leaves this building,
this thing blows.

452
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:56,356
You gomers messed with
the wrong super genius,

453
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,711
and now it's time
for a little payback.

454
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,076
Nygma, you're a son of a bitch!

455
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,551
Oh, not now, Bullock.

456
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,549
The body count at Haven
wasn't big enough for you, huh?

457
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,720
Shut up!

458
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,950
What's your game?

459
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,918
The only way
to deactivate this bomb

460
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,274
is to put a four-digit code
on the keypad there.

461
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,829
What's the code?

462
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,880
(clears throat)

463
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:25,792
The pallid beach mouse
can give birth every four weeks.

464
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:27,999
Assuming we start

465
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,070
with two mice,

466
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:33,029
and that the size
of an average litter is 12 mice,

467
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,797
and that they are equally
split male to female,

468
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,755
how many pallid beach mice

469
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:43,675
would we have
at the end of one year?

470
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:50,118
The answer to that question
is the code.

471
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,676
Oh, I almost forgot.

472
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,237
- You have two minutes.
- (beeps)

473
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,314
After that,
everyone in here goes splat.

474
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,440
Except for me, of course.

475
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,919
(panting)

476
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,556
I'm in position.

477
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,752
Copy. Plug the recorder
to the transmitter.

478
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,816
Next, you'll connect
the transmitter to the radio.

479
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,936
There should be a black box
at the base of the antenna.

480
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,519
Let me know
when you get it open.

481
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,800
- Nygma's bomb ploy won't last forever.
- We just have to

482
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,216
wait for the exhaust
fans to come to

483
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,118
a complete stop before
you can use the gas.

484
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,075
What are you doing?

485
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,438
(grunting and groaning)

486
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,840
(both grunting)

487
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,231
(both groaning)

488
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:16,554
You want to take responsibility
for people dying?

489
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,594
Look around.

490
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,670
This is all on you.

491
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,195
What the hell does that mean?

492
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,915
Walker spent months

493
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,635
trying to convince
her superiors that Gotham

494
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,559
was overrun by criminals.

495
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,197
We were this close
to being sent in

496
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,117
when you set up Haven.

497
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,035
The fact that
one man was able

498
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,959
to safely house
and rescue hundreds

499
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,271
of innocent civilians
showed the military higher-ups

500
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,471
that the criminal element
of Gotham

501
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,360
must not be so big
and scary after all.

502
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,957
They were ready
to send in relief,

503
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,919
so it had to come down.

504
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,358
Why? What the hell
does she want?

505
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,480
They were innocent
people, children.

506
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,595
They were an acceptable loss
for the mission.

507
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,835
What mission, damn it?

508
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,230
(laughs)

509
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,756
That's enough.

510
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,559
(grunts)

511
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,479
Take her out back and shoot her.

512
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,271
He doesn't need to see this.

513
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,150
It's my gift to you,

514
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,755
a small mercy.

515
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,440
You never should have
brought her into this, Eduardo.

516
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,680
(groans)

517
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,237
Can we speed things along,
please, Mr. Fox?

518
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,959
The exhaust fans
have to wind down

519
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,514
before they can
change directions.

520
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,752
If you throw the canisters in
now, the gas will blow outside.

521
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,792
Bruce, status?

522
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,880
One second.

523
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,518
I'm here. The box is open.

524
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,416
LUCIUS: Two dark green wires
right in front.

525
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,080
Attach those to the transmitter.
The message will send.

526
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,798
(whirring, beeping)

527
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,550
It's done.

528
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,110
One minute left.

529
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,670
Everybody hear that?

530
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,760
One minute before
this thing explodes.

531
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,360
I know the answer.

532
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:01,558
Uh... (chuckles) Nope,
don't think you do, Bullock.

533
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,639
My high school zoology class is
still rattling around up here.

534
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,354
High school was
a long time ago,

535
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,160
so let's just take
the full minute, shall we?

536
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,750
Really think about it.

537
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,036
I don't need to.

538
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,000
The pallid beach mouse
is extinct.

539
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:19,194
It disappeared
in 1959.

540
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,434
The number you'll have at
the end of the year is zero.

541
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,994
The number is zero.

542
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,560
Trust me on this.

543
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,800
I got in trouble. I had to
write an essay about it.

544
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,160
I swear to God.

545
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,475
Oh, dear.

546
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,311
(indistinct chatter)

547
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,840
(groans)

548
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,075
I got a math problem for you.

549
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,600
- Count these bullets.
- (inhales)

550
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Yes!

551
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,753
- (grunts)
- You want to know why

552
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,839
Ramirez and the rest
didn't make it out?

553
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,559
After your tour
of duty was up,

554
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,513
we were caught
behind enemy lines,

555
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,513
taken to the darkest
hell on Earth...

556
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,955
Peña Duro.

557
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,400
Have you heard of it?

558
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:40,678
Prison? I didn't know.

559
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,880
No one did,

560
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:47,396
'cause it's where we were
left to die by our government.

561
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,272
I was the only one
that survived.

562
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,760
Walker...

563
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,634
Walker, she found me
in that place.

564
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,196
She pulled me out.

565
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,314
She gave me a
new purpose.

566
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,750
She made you her killer.

567
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,117
No, no, Jim.

568
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,720
She's the killer.

569
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,431
And you have no idea.

570
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,600
- (gunshots)
- Lee?

571
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:47,156
You and your stupid revenge.

572
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,400
The diamond isn't even worth
anything in Gotham anyway.

573
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,034
Unless...

574
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,911
The diamond is worth
something on the mainland.

575
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,677
And I bet you have

576
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:08,473
way more where that came from.

577
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,916
You're leaving Gotham.

578
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,480
Congratulations,
you're a genius.

579
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,480
Why?

580
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,478
"Alexander the Great

581
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,031
"then looked upon his land

582
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,835
"and wept.

583
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,198
For there was nothing left
to conquer."

584
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,197
I've done all I can in Gotham.

585
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,313
Some things twice.
(chuckles lightly)

586
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,071
There's nothing left
for me here anymore.

587
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,715
I want in.

588
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,799
I can't even walk
around the city

589
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,270
without some lowlife
trying to take me out.

590
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,392
Just so he can
up his cred.

591
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,840
I don't want to be the person
who killed Jeremiah Valeska.

592
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,753
I just want to be myself.

593
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,271
And I can't do that
in Gotham anymore.

594
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,473
My heart weeps for you.

595
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,436
But no.

596
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:21,275
- What if I could get us out of here?
- (Oswald laughs)

597
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,238
You do that, I will cut you in.

598
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,720
50-50.

599
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:28,954
Ten percent,
and I won't murder you

600
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,589
- once we reach the mainland.
- Deal.

601
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,470
Selina, wait!

602
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:44,199
She said, "Anything in the room
could be a bomb."

603
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,318
Not the room itself.

604
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,714
Did you know that
the whole time?

605
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,156
Just thought of it.

606
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,479
We should hurry before

607
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,800
she gets away with
all our stuff.

608
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,200
Don't worry.

609
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,599
She won't get far.

610
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,679
Alvarez, take Lee
to my office.

611
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Be right there.

612
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,713
I got to be honest
with you, man.

613
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,056
I don't know how many more
of these close calls

614
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,400
this old heart can take.

615
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,016
We were able to transmit
the audio logs,

616
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,560
but until I hear back
from my contacts,

617
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,976
I won't know
if they received them.

618
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,320
Well, if they did,

619
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:17,994
probably have
a lot of questions.

620
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,999
We'll spend the night
and help out.

621
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,136
Alfred, can you go back to the
apartment and grab what you can?

622
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,514
Certainly,
Master Bruce.

623
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,596
Thanks, Bruce.

624
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,480
The next time I
get a short straw,

625
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:31,994
I'm just gonna
walk into traffic.

626
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,591
Where has Lee been
this whole time?

627
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,876
I don't know.

628
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,596
I'm not gonna
wait around

629
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,837
to watch their
touching reunion.

630
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,872
What is happening here?

631
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,793
I don't know where to start.

632
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,678
When I didn't hear from you,

633
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,357
I'd hoped you'd
gotten out of Gotham.

634
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,877
The last thing
that I remember

635
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,109
is Jeremiah destroying
the bridges.

636
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,154
That was over
three months ago.

637
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,676
Three months?
Oh, my God.

638
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,440
You don't remember anything?

639
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,680
I'm trying, and...

640
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,352
Right before the bridges
came down,

641
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,594
you said you were
leaving the city.

642
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,520
Why didn't you?

643
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:24,439
I don't know, Jim.

644
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,113
None of this
is making any sense.

645
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,074
We're still cut off.

646
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,674
There's no help.

647
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,870
It's been hard.

648
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,718
Actually, that's not true.

649
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,110
It's been hell.

650
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,636
People needed hope,

651
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,553
so I put on a
brave face.

652
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,160
Pretended I knew
what to do.

653
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,034
But you know me, Lee.

654
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:52,960
I'm just a cop.

655
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,917
And now I'm really lost.

656
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,269
Hey, it's okay.

657
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,159
(distant siren)

658
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,632
We're here now.

659
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:10,036
We'll just try to put
the pieces back together again.

660
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,274
Maybe we can help each other.

661
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,953
Let's start with my memory.

662
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,479
I went back
to the Narrows.

663
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,280
I saw Ed.

664
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,277
We fought. We...

665
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,040
Oh.

666
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,150
He stabbed me.

667
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,037
- What?
- Wait, let me remember.

668
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,914
I stabbed him.

669
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,158
There was
so much blood.

670
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,677
Then I was... (exhales)

671
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,274
somewhere...

672
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,559
A hospital, maybe?

673
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,399
- (scoffs)
- (man groans)

674
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:18,553
Eduardo. (clicks tongue)

675
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,393
So much potential,

676
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,916
but not quite up
to the task.

677
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,270
- (beeping)
- Walker.

678
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,840
(case opens)

679
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,120
How?

680
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,080
We've been burned.

681
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,069
The press have
recordings of me

682
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,675
instructing Nygma
to take down Haven.

683
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,233
I thought I might
accomplish my task

684
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,477
without setting foot
in this foul city,

685
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,075
but that's not to be.

686
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,834
- You won't die yet, my warrior.
- (groaning)

687
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,195
There is so much more
for you to do.

688
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,519
Professor Strange will have you
fixed up in no time.

689
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,072
(device beeps, clicks)

690
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,954
(respirator powers up)

691
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,554
(sharp inhale)

692
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,757
(distorted):
Jim Gordon.

693
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,312
Don't worry
about Gordon.

694
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,877
Nygma was never alone.

695
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,357
There was a
second operative.

696
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,079
(sharp inhale)

697
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,080
You okay?

698
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,440
You cold?

699
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,800
(brief whir)

700
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,598
The hospitals were
all out of commission.

701
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,912
Just the one clinic
in the green zone.

702
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,880
Lee?

703
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,394
Time to die, Jim Gordon.

704
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,074
(Jim grunting)

705
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,754

00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:54,039
Wanted: one butler.

714
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,277
Military background a plus.

715
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,756
References required.

716
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,072
Yes, Mr. Pennyworth.

717
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,996
I have a job for you.

718

SELINA: Well, you weren't
lying when you said

721
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,395
she wouldn't get far.

722
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,120
(dog panting)

723
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:24,597
Pretty crown's...
(chuckles) booby-trapped.

724
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,600
Ouch.

725
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,480
Ouch, indeed.

726
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,840
I couldn't have you
coming back here

727
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,951
and making off with
all of my belongings.

728
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:36,235
Our belongings.

729
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,719
Cut my wings, let me go?

730
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,200
Bang, bang.

731
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,479
- What the hell?
- (dog whines)

732
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:48,075
The buckshot in her gut
wasn't enough punishment?

733
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,034
Just a little reminder
of what happens

734
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,032
when people try
to steal from me.

735
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:55,034
(shuddering breath)
Good to know.

736
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,590
Partner.

737
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,752
(sirens wailing)

738
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,234
BULLOCK:
So Lee has a chip, too?

739
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,917
GORDON: I don't know how,
but it seems that way.

740
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,000
Walker must have
been holding onto her

741
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,912
as some sort of
plan B this whole time.

742
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,879
Three months? That's a hell
of a long game she's playing.

743
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:17,919
Which means she probably has
other tricks up her sleeve.

744
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,520
(moans)

745
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,760
Hey.

746
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,430
(grunts)

747
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,433
- Welcome back.
- Oh, hell.

748
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,319
This is gonna keep happening.

749
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,034
What's wrong with me?

750
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,397
The good news is, I think
I can actually answer that.

751
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,513
- (exhales)
- (door opens)

752
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,720
BARBARA:
Jim.

753
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,036
I need to talk to you.

754
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,158
Now is not a good
time, Barbara.

755
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,656
Don't you remember the good time
we had the other night?

756
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,160
- Over there?
- Say what?

757
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,834
You need to leave now.

758
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,914
I'm pregnant.

759
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,520
Good to see you, Lee.

760
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,589
Long time.

761
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,120
Congratulations?

762
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:12,954
(buoy bell dinging)

763
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,436
(labored breathing)

764
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:19,836
You.

765
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,193
You're supposed
to be dead, mate.

766
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,872
Sorry to disappoint.

767
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,231
You hurt my boy...

768
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,351
and I will bite your face off.

769
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,512
(manic giggling)

770
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,512
(laughing):
Yeah. Yeah.

771
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,360
Ah... Bruce will be
along shortly.

772
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,634
In the meantime...

773
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,518
This place is in desperate need

774
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,275
of some good, old-fashioned
butlering.

775
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:56,109
How did you even find a way off
the bloody island anyway?

776
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,473
How? One if by land,

777
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,035
two if by sea,

778
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:04,234
three if by digging
a tunnel under the river.

779
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,200
But enough questions.

780
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,756
Today is the big day.
