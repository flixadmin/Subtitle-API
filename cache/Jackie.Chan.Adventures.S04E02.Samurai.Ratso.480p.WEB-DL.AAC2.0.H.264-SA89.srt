1
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:07,239
I am the one and only
king of the shadowkhan.

2
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:09,708
(Gasps) Oni.

3
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:12,478
My mother told me
tales of the oni--

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,080
hideous horned
demons.

5
00:00:15,082 --> 00:00:17,216
Tarakudo: It was
from this mask

6
00:00:17,218 --> 00:00:21,653
that shendu drew
the power to control
his shadowkhan army.

7
00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:25,557
Tohru: Ancient warriors
once cast a spell
to defeat this oni.

8
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:28,994
The key ingredient
was Japanese steel.

9
00:00:28,996 --> 00:00:31,296
Tarakudo's reign
came to an end

10
00:00:31,298 --> 00:00:34,767
when the spirits
of his generals were
trapped within masks.

11
00:00:34,769 --> 00:00:38,003
9 general...9 masks.

12
00:00:38,005 --> 00:00:40,406
9 different tribes
of shadowkhan?

13
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:47,246
Whoa.

14
00:00:47,248 --> 00:00:48,614
"Captain black,

15
00:00:48,616 --> 00:00:51,917
"do not allow anyone
to wear this mask.

16
00:00:51,919 --> 00:00:54,820
Jackie: Please lock it
in the vault
immediately.

17
00:00:54,822 --> 00:00:59,658
Jade, uncle, tohru,
and I are currently
in Tokyo, Japan,

18
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,326
where we hope
to discover a lead

19
00:01:01,328 --> 00:01:04,063
to the location
of the next oni
mask.

20
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:08,133
Karaoke break, anyone?

21
00:01:08,135 --> 00:01:12,204
Jade, the first rule
of research is Patience.

22
00:01:12,206 --> 00:01:14,606
Uncle: Can you not
read faster, tohru?

23
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:17,443
Cobwebs are forming
on uncle!

24
00:01:17,445 --> 00:01:20,379
My Japanese is rusty,
sensei.

25
00:01:20,381 --> 00:01:23,382
Hmmhh! At this rate,
new forces of darkness

26
00:01:23,384 --> 00:01:26,618
will locate
8 other masks
before we leave room!

27
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:27,686
(Jade shouts)

28
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:30,255
Jade!

29
00:01:30,957 --> 00:01:32,424
Why do research

30
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:34,726
when you can
come on down to

31
00:01:34,728 --> 00:01:37,262
the oni mask
superstore!

32
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:39,998
Oni!

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,501
Until a cursed one
is worn,

34
00:01:42,503 --> 00:01:44,169
these
are merely masks.

35
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:46,004
Then why do I have
a strange,

36
00:01:46,006 --> 00:01:48,207
clammy feeling
down my spine?

37
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:49,408
<i>You...</i>

38
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:51,610
Have
the willies?

39
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:54,179
Usually
a pretty good sign

40
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:57,116
that the king of all oni
is in the house!

41
00:01:57,118 --> 00:01:59,351
Tarakudo!
- Tarakudo!

42
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:51,537
(Shuddering)
Ohhh!

43
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:54,740
Henchmen!

44
00:02:54,742 --> 00:02:57,609
Lend a hand,
won't you, and
fetch the mask.

45
00:02:58,244 --> 00:02:59,611
Ratso: Uh...

46
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:01,013
Which mask?

47
00:03:01,015 --> 00:03:02,581
The magic one!

48
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:08,687
No! Stop!

49
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:16,428
Nope.
- Nope.

50
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,629
No.
- That's not it.

51
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:18,730
Nuh-uh.
Ho ho.

52
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:19,798
Nah. Nope.
That's
not it.

53
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,899
Nope. Nope.

54
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:22,100
Jade:
Hands off!

55
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:28,040
Quickly, tohru!

56
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:30,209
We most devise
locator spell

57
00:03:30,211 --> 00:03:32,711
so we may find mask
before they do!

58
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:37,149
Back! Back!

59
00:03:37,151 --> 00:03:40,085
Easy. You could chop
someone's head off
with that.

60
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:44,823
What are you doing?!

61
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:47,292
Uh...Lookin'
for the mask?

62
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:48,827
Try <i> this</i> fellow.

63
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:56,902
Hak foo:
Kangaroo hop!

64
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:00,572
Nice grab.

65
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:02,808
Ratso:
Gotcha!

66
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:03,875
Huh?

67
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,278
Heee-yah!

68
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,646
Ratso: Ooh!

69
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,017
Oopsy.

70
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:13,485
(Groaning)

71
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:15,120
Ohhh...

72
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:16,388
Whoa.

73
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,323
Oh, <i> I</i> wanted
that mask!

74
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,026
Ow!

75
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:22,261
Too late
for locator spell.

76
00:04:22,263 --> 00:04:24,596
We need
mask removal spell.

77
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:27,199
Good thing
Japanese steel
ingredient

78
00:04:27,201 --> 00:04:29,034
very handy
this time.

79
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:32,938
Oh, man! I feel like...

80
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,073
Summoning shadowkhan?

81
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:36,975
Yeahhhh!

82
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:39,611
So...Do I just
yell for 'em,
or what?

83
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:42,247
You must feel
the power, ratso.

84
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:44,216
Call upon
the darkness within.

85
00:04:44,218 --> 00:04:46,652
Oh, ok. I got it.

86
00:04:46,654 --> 00:04:50,289
Uhh! No!
No feeling!
No calling!

87
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:52,891
Gohh--uhh!

88
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,727
Come on, shadowkhan!

89
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,229
(Gasps)

90
00:04:57,231 --> 00:04:58,664
Unhh!

91
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,470
Whoa!

92
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:06,838
Sweet.

93
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,807
Go, ratso!

94
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,375
9 masks...

95
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:13,312
9 different tribes
of shadowkhan.

96
00:05:13,314 --> 00:05:14,646
Uncle, how is

97
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:17,049
your mask removal
spell coming?

98
00:05:17,051 --> 00:05:18,317
All done.

99
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:19,584
Aiiyee!

100
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:24,089
The sword did not
work, sensei.

101
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:26,224
It must be
wrong ingredient.

102
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:30,295
Each mask must require
a unique removal spell!

103
00:05:30,297 --> 00:05:32,564
Which do we need
to remove <i> this</i> mask?

104
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:35,801
You are Japanese expert!
That is <i> your</i> department!

105
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,336
Ahem.

106
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:40,972
Oh. Right.

107
00:05:40,974 --> 00:05:42,641
Make papa proud!

108
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:46,478
You hit him high,
Jackie,
I'll hit him low.

109
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,646
Awpp!

110
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:50,315
D-uhh!

111
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:52,451
Uhh!

112
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:54,619
Uhhh! Uhh...?

113
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:57,222
Uhh!

114
00:05:57,224 --> 00:05:58,523
Aah!

115
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:01,293
Come. Let us seek
more masks

116
00:06:01,295 --> 00:06:02,794
while ratso summons

117
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:04,196
more shadowkhan.

118
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:05,364
Hah hah hah hah!

119
00:06:05,366 --> 00:06:07,599
The more, the scarier.

120
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:08,900
Urrrhhh!

121
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:10,802
D-eeeee!

122
00:06:10,804 --> 00:06:13,505
Uncle:
Oh, Mr. ninja!

123
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:15,674
Eat chi magic!

124
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:20,679
Uncle's regular magic

125
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:23,248
does not work
on these new shadowkhan!

126
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,751
We must devise
new stun spell.

127
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:31,623
Uhh! Euhh! Uhh!

128
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:42,667
(Metal clang)

129
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:53,445
Heh. Sayonara.

130
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,985
Jackie! Sensei! Run!

131
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:02,020
Come on, come on,
come on!

132
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:10,262
Ooowahh!

133
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:13,265
Darkness within.

134
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:14,499
Darkness within.

135
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:16,701
Darkness within.

136
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:18,236
Unhh!
- Uhh!
- Uhh!

137
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:28,213
Ohhhhh...

138
00:07:28,215 --> 00:07:29,448
Boy...

139
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:33,952
Yes! I am good!

140
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,287
Get chan!

141
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:38,657
Huh?

142
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:47,299
Ohh...
Grab on!

143
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,071
D-uhhh...

144
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:54,639
Yaahhh!
Aaahhh!

145
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:01,012
Tohru: Aaahhh...Uhh!

146
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:02,280
P-uhhh.

147
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:06,952
I hate fish.

148
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:09,988
Ratso: Hey!

149
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:13,992
Where'd everybody go?

150
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:18,396
Tarakudo:
A job well done, boys.

151
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:21,166
For our next trick...
Whoo-o-o-o!

152
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:23,335
Whoa. Are you
all right?

153
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:24,870
What is it,
big kahuna?

154
00:08:24,872 --> 00:08:26,705
I think I...

155
00:08:26,707 --> 00:08:28,406
Have the willies.

156
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:33,812
Sensei...

157
00:08:33,814 --> 00:08:35,180
The scroll speaks

158
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:37,249
of the legendary
Hana-fuda...

159
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:39,384
An ancient deck of cards.

160
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:42,420
My mommy told me
of these cards
when I was young.

161
00:08:42,422 --> 00:08:44,956
Phewww!
More fairy tales.

162
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,858
Cards not important!

163
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,728
But legend indicates
that the cards are magic...

164
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:52,597
And may point the way
to the remaining oni masks.

165
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:56,668
I am telling you,
cards not important!

166
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,904
Tohru?

167
00:08:58,906 --> 00:09:01,706
Let me guess.
Your old pal Willie?

168
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:11,483
So...

169
00:09:11,485 --> 00:09:14,386
Hoping to find
the Hana-fuda cards?

170
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:16,988
Well, I can't
let you do that!

171
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,060
Ok...

172
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,995
Maybe cards important.

173
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:33,705
Back!

174
00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:34,906
Onion?

175
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:36,608
Do not be
foolish, tohru.

176
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,777
Use garlic.

177
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:41,046
Whoa! Easy
with that veggie,
big fella.

178
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,185
Aaahh! My eyes!

179
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:48,920
It <i> does</i> work!

180
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,089
I think it is
checkout time.

181
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:54,759
Rahhhhhh!

182
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:57,462
Mommy always told me
onions keep
the oni away.

183
00:09:57,464 --> 00:09:59,898
I used to
sleep with one
under my pillow.

184
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,967
You da man, t!
You da man!

185
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:05,036
Yes...He is.

186
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:07,706
The best thing

187
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:10,976
about makin'
your own team of ninjas?

188
00:10:10,978 --> 00:10:14,245
Is makin' enough
for 2 teams!

189
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:19,851
Ratso: Ooh,
high fly!

190
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:21,553
If <i> I</i> wore
the mask,

191
00:10:21,555 --> 00:10:25,190
all of Japan
would be under
my rule by now!

192
00:10:25,192 --> 00:10:27,692
Oh, ball boy...

193
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:29,628
Ohhh...Get it
yourself.

194
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,232
You don't want
to spoil our fun...

195
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:36,368
Do you, hak foo?

196
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,503
Tarakudo: Ratso!

197
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:40,639
Gather your
shadow minions.

198
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:43,475
You must see to it
Mr. chan fails

199
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:47,245
to acquire a certain...
Deck of cards.

200
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:49,114
Let the games
begin.

201
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:52,250
We must take
the train to matsue.

202
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:53,918
The Hana-fuda cards
are housed

203
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,587
in an ancient shrine
there.

204
00:10:55,589 --> 00:10:58,957
Legend indicates
that the cards
contain the spells

205
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,259
which originally
defeated the oni.

206
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:03,628
Handy-dandy
mask removal
action.

207
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,034
Oh, uncle, that
is not our train.

208
00:11:09,036 --> 00:11:10,902
It is mine.

209
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:13,171
Uncle must go
to airport now.

210
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,272
What?

211
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:15,840
Why?

212
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:17,776
Bein' away from shop
for so long

213
00:11:17,778 --> 00:11:20,211
makes me...Nervous?

214
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:21,680
Uncle...

215
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:23,214
(Sighs)

216
00:11:23,216 --> 00:11:25,884
I am only
getting in your way.

217
00:11:25,886 --> 00:11:28,787
Tohru has knowledge
of Japanese legends...

218
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:30,522
Which uncle does not.

219
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:32,824
Tohru gets willies
from oni,

220
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:34,626
which uncle does not.

221
00:11:34,628 --> 00:11:36,995
Tohru knows tricks
with vegetables,

222
00:11:36,997 --> 00:11:38,296
which uncle...

223
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:40,098
I require
your guidance.

224
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,268
I offer you
my confidence.

225
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,304
Jade, go with uncle.

226
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:47,572
Ohhh...

227
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:57,315
Jade:
I miss him
already.

228
00:11:57,317 --> 00:12:00,618
Jade! I told you
to go with uncle,

229
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,321
not stay
with...Uncle.

230
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:05,590
Tch! No wonder
I got confused.

231
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:07,258
Too many uncles.

232
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,061
Ratso:
All aboard...

233
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,732
The shadowkhan express!

234
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:18,303
Gonna make you cry,
demon boy.

235
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:21,172
(Munching)

236
00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:24,509
Mmm, mmm. Yummy.

237
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:27,178
Uh, ratso
is still
part human,

238
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,581
and his human side
likes onions?

239
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:35,854
Quick! Inside!

240
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,598
Darkness within,
darkness within,

241
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,100
darkness within,
darkness within...

242
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:52,537
You have a train
to catch!

243
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:14,893
Huhh! Uhh!

244
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:23,268
Unhh!

245
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:26,871
Heyyy-yuhh!

246
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:40,418
Uuurrrhhhh!

247
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:45,723
Uncle told me to devise
a new stun spell...

248
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:47,058
So I did.

249
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:49,060
This is it.

250
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,729
That's a shrine?

251
00:13:51,731 --> 00:13:53,932
If it was,
it is a factory now.

252
00:13:53,934 --> 00:13:55,633
Wait.

253
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:58,369
This <i> kanji</i> meaning
Hana-fuda...

254
00:13:58,371 --> 00:14:00,471
Is also
the factory logo.

255
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:06,477
Jackie: Hello!

256
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:07,812
Anybody here?

257
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:12,050
Oh. You do not
work here.

258
00:14:12,052 --> 00:14:14,786
Uh, maybe you
can help us, sir.

259
00:14:14,788 --> 00:14:17,655
We are looking
for some...Cards.

260
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:19,324
Hana-fuda cards?

261
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:25,129
Those would be the ones.

262
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:35,506
Thus, the cards
were handed down
from my ancestors.

263
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:37,108
As you can see,

264
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:40,912
I based
my company logo on
the Hana-fuda <i> kanji.</i>

265
00:14:40,914 --> 00:14:43,748
So...Why <i> are</i> you
so interested

266
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,284
in my family's
deck of cards?

267
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:48,653
Are you familiar
with...Oni?

268
00:14:48,655 --> 00:14:51,856
Of course.
My grandmother
would read me stories

269
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:54,559
when I was a child. Why?

270
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:57,428
Some very bad oni
know of your cards.

271
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:01,599
Ha ha ha ha ha!

272
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:04,335
(Laughing)
Oni are not real.

273
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:06,838
They are stuff
of children's tales.

274
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,007
What is it?

275
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:10,241
The girl...

276
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:11,676
Her shadow.

277
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:13,611
Uh-oh.

278
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:17,849
Hiya.

279
00:15:17,851 --> 00:15:21,019
Oni! (Sobbing) Ohhh!

280
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,024
Ohhhhh!

281
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:28,459
Take the cards!
They are yours!

282
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:29,727
Hand them over!

283
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,198
Here you go.

284
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,167
Oh, gee, thanks.

285
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:37,302
Hey!

286
00:15:37,304 --> 00:15:39,537
Sorry I would not return them.
Thank you.

287
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:42,173
Get those cards!

288
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:49,147
The old fake hand-off.

289
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:51,082
A mask removal spell
is the only way

290
00:15:51,084 --> 00:15:53,985
to stop ratso's
shadowkhan for good.

291
00:15:53,987 --> 00:15:55,553
They're all blank?

292
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:57,822
Did the scroll
say anything
about how to play?

293
00:15:57,824 --> 00:15:59,457
No.

294
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,225
Then we need to figure out
how to play...

295
00:16:01,227 --> 00:16:02,293
Fast.

296
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:06,331
(Grunting and shouting)

297
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:29,487
Hmm.

298
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:31,155
Hooahh!

299
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,192
D-ohh!

300
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:36,327
D-ohhhh!

301
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:37,562
D-ohh.

302
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:39,697
Aaahh!

303
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:42,433
Bye-bye!
Drive safely!

304
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,140
Uhhh!

305
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:51,609
D-oohh! D-oohh!
Uhh! D-oohh!

306
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:53,845
Uh...Gin rummy?

307
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:55,380
How about...Crazy 8s?

308
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,216
Whoa! Look!

309
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:00,418
It's showing us the mask!

310
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,387
But we already
know that part.

311
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:05,656
This one's telling us
where to find--

312
00:17:05,658 --> 00:17:07,091
er, where we found it.

313
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:11,362
And...For
a lifetime supply
of grape soda...

314
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:13,531
The mask removal spell
ingredient is...

315
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,867
Tohru: Japanese silk.

316
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:17,502
You mean like
in a kimono?

317
00:17:17,504 --> 00:17:20,171
Where can we find
a kimono
at this time of...

318
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:23,508
Game...Over.

319
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:26,611
Ohhhh!

320
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:30,848
Leave him alone,
you bully!

321
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:34,352
Tohru didn't invite <i> me</i>
to play cards.

322
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:36,421
You can play
<i>my</i> favorite--

323
00:17:36,423 --> 00:17:37,722
go fish.

324
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:47,265
Hel-lo.

325
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:49,634
Uncle!

326
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:07,185
Hmm.

327
00:18:07,187 --> 00:18:09,053
Very good stun spell.

328
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:13,024
Yeah? Well, I got
more ninja bad boys

329
00:18:13,026 --> 00:18:16,094
where <i> they</i> came from.
Mmhh!

330
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:17,528
Unhhh...Hhh!

331
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,197
D-ohh!
- Ooh!

332
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:20,665
Uncle!
You're back!

333
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,835
Only because
I realized

334
00:18:23,837 --> 00:18:25,736
I do not have
keys to shop!

335
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:27,872

377
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,607

378

Oni magic cannot
defeat onion magic.

379
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,313
A little trick
I learned

380
00:20:15,315 --> 00:20:16,547
from my...

381
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:17,982
Apprentice.

382
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:26,924
Jade: Hey, Jackie,
do you play baseball?

383
00:20:26,926 --> 00:20:28,826
Of course I like baseball.
You know what?

384
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:33,331
I'm the honorable chairman
baseball captain

385
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,333
in Hong Kong.

386
00:20:35,335 --> 00:20:37,935
Uh, I do play baseball,

387
00:20:37,937 --> 00:20:40,204
but I'm--actually,
I'm not really good,

388
00:20:40,206 --> 00:20:43,374
because when I look at TV,
it just easy.

389
00:20:43,376 --> 00:20:46,010
But you really
try to hit it,
it's difficult.

390
00:20:46,012 --> 00:20:47,945
I love...Baseball.
