1
00:02:15,511 --> 00:02:18,598
Junk car! Junk car!

2
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:38,326
Get out of here, kid.

3
00:02:55,885 --> 00:02:57,387
I told you to get out of here.

4
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:11,359
OCTOBER 23, 1986

5
00:03:21,536 --> 00:03:23,204
- Go home, kid.
- Go home, kid.

6
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:26,582
- Little brat.
- Little brat.

7
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:30,878
- What the hell are they doing?
- What the hell are they doing?

8
00:03:30,962 --> 00:03:32,463
- Hey, you!
- Hey, you!

9
00:03:32,547 --> 00:03:34,382
- Put that back!
- Put that back!

10
00:03:37,218 --> 00:03:40,888
Hey, leave it there. Go away.

11
00:03:40,972 --> 00:03:42,223
- Hey, you!
- Hey, you!

12
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:45,685
- That's important, don't touch!
- That's important, don't touch!

13
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:50,022
- Those kids.
- Those kids.

14
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:28,644
MEMORIES OF MURDER

15
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:33,774
What?

16
00:04:34,567 --> 00:04:37,778
You dated the dead girl,
and she dumped you last August?

17
00:04:37,862 --> 00:04:39,197
Is that right?

18
00:04:39,989 --> 00:04:41,616
That's correct.

19
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:45,453
That's correct?
Take off your hat, you damn punk.

20
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:49,665
Do women like guys like you?

21
00:04:51,167 --> 00:04:57,840
After watching <i>Body Heat...</i>

22
00:04:58,466 --> 00:05:00,885
<i>Body Heat</i>? That an action movie?

23
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:04,305
A, C, T...

24
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:13,272
Damn punk.

25
00:05:13,356 --> 00:05:17,985
Since it's a rape
and murder case and all...

26
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:20,571
well...

27
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:25,660
If she was sexy, or pretty,
that sort of thing.

28
00:05:25,743 --> 00:05:26,953
Your impressions?

29
00:05:28,037 --> 00:05:29,080
Well...

30
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:32,625
she didn't seem like a country girl...

31
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:35,419
Don't blink.

32
00:05:38,256 --> 00:05:39,423
You blinked, didn't you?

33
00:05:39,507 --> 00:05:41,342
Hey, look at me.

34
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:46,597
Don't look at the ceiling, look at me!

35
00:05:48,099 --> 00:05:51,310
Was he born that way? One, two...

36
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:07,493
Didn't you want to go
to the Military Academy?

37
00:06:07,577 --> 00:06:09,078
Did you take the exam?

38
00:06:09,996 --> 00:06:12,415
You need to study hard to get in there.

39
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:18,379
- Receipt!
- You didn't ask for one.

40
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:21,090
What? I told you to bring one.

41
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:24,093
- I told you.
- No you didn't.

42
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:26,429
That's what you said last time...

43
00:06:26,512 --> 00:06:28,931
Here's one, here.

44
00:06:30,099 --> 00:06:34,520
You answered the phone, you lying bastard.

45
00:06:34,604 --> 00:06:38,733
I need a receipt from the restaurant.
Not from a bicycle shop.

46
00:06:41,861 --> 00:06:47,199
DIRECTED BY BONG JOON HO

47
00:06:50,494 --> 00:06:52,663
Why didn't you rope the place off?

48
00:06:52,747 --> 00:06:56,292
At least get some sticks
to drive them in, morons.

49
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,878
Inspector Park, over here!

50
00:07:00,004 --> 00:07:02,006
- What is this?
- It's a footprint.

51
00:07:02,423 --> 00:07:05,635
- When did you find it?
- This morning, sir!

52
00:07:05,718 --> 00:07:07,428
Go help those jerks over there.

53
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:12,224
- You called the forensics team?
- Yes, they're on their way.

54
00:07:13,392 --> 00:07:16,896
But where's the person who reported this?

55
00:07:17,897 --> 00:07:22,151
No forensics team, this is total chaos!

56
00:07:22,568 --> 00:07:24,445
Jesus, look at him!

57
00:07:26,322 --> 00:07:27,573
Hey!

58
00:07:27,657 --> 00:07:28,824
Get out of here!

59
00:07:32,036 --> 00:07:34,038
Who received the call on this?

60
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:35,956
Did you find out who reported it?

61
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,501
The phone...
The crime site is getting ruined.

62
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:41,837
Damn forensics team's not here,
this is a mess.

63
00:07:41,921 --> 00:07:44,507
What are you talking about?

64
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:48,552
Take pictures when I tell you!

65
00:07:49,345 --> 00:07:51,764
Why'd you bring so many reporters?

66
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:54,725
They were all here when I arrived.

67
00:07:55,643 --> 00:07:58,270
Reporter Park's not here.
Must be on vacation.

68
00:07:58,354 --> 00:08:01,399
- I don't see him.
- Feels great with that shithead gone.

69
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:04,985
Why does this have to happen to me?

70
00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:07,988
How can I investigate like this?

71
00:08:08,072 --> 00:08:12,284
Hey, tractor! Hey, tractor!

72
00:08:12,368 --> 00:08:13,786
Tractor!

73
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:19,583
Tractor, stay away! Detour!

74
00:08:23,129 --> 00:08:25,423
If someone waves, shouldn't you look?

75
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:27,216
Shit, is he deaf?

76
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:30,803
Shit! Look at this.

77
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:33,681
Now those bastards show up.

78
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:39,311
What the hell took you so long?

79
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:42,565
The crime scene's ruined!

80
00:08:42,648 --> 00:08:46,902
Jesus, look at these sliding fools!

81
00:08:46,986 --> 00:08:48,863
What's going on?

82
00:08:54,994 --> 00:08:58,789
How can you look at those photos
while eating?

83
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:03,711
If I keep staring at them,

84
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:06,005
one moment it'll hit me.

85
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:08,632
- Instinctively.
- Are you a fortune teller?

86
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,968
Open up a shop then.

87
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:17,224
Chief, I may know nothing else,
but my eyes can read people.

88
00:09:18,434 --> 00:09:20,394
It's how I survive as a detective.

89
00:09:20,478 --> 00:09:24,732
There's a reason people say
I have shaman's eyes.

90
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:27,318
Okay, then.

91
00:09:28,027 --> 00:09:30,029
You see those two guys there?

92
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:37,953
One of them's a rapist,
and the other is the victim's brother.

93
00:09:38,037 --> 00:09:45,252
He caught the guy doing this
to his sister, and dragged him in.

94
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:53,844
So tell me, which one's the rapist?

95
00:10:06,774 --> 00:10:08,400
- Hey.
- What?

96
00:10:08,484 --> 00:10:09,693
I think it fell out.

97
00:10:09,777 --> 00:10:11,070
Really?

98
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:13,405
Let's do this properly.

99
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:21,539
I'll give this to you especially today.

100
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:22,998
I'm so grateful.

101
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,503
It's just a flu shot.

102
00:10:28,254 --> 00:10:29,630
Know how much this costs?

103
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:34,635
- Kwak Seol-yeong?
- Yeah?

104
00:10:35,261 --> 00:10:38,514
You must be earning more now
than at the hospital.

105
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,687
I hear everyone in town comes to you.

106
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:47,690
Shh. I got something to tell you.

107
00:10:48,274 --> 00:10:51,110
I heard this from the old woman
at the mill.

108
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:55,656
You know the Baek family meat restaurant?

109
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:57,575
The Baek family?

110
00:10:58,409 --> 00:11:01,453
You know what people call them?

111
00:11:01,871 --> 00:11:02,872
What?

112
00:11:04,248 --> 00:11:06,125
The Baek Lady Killers.

113
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:10,004
- Ladies?
- Yeah.

114
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:15,759
But the son's a little bit retarded.
Kwang-ho.

115
00:11:17,136 --> 00:11:21,557
Kwang-ho used to follow
Hyang-sook around all the time.

116
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:24,560
Hyang-sook? The one who was killed?

117
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:26,353
Yeah.

118
00:11:27,271 --> 00:11:32,276
She was found with a girdle over her head?

119
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:33,360
Right.

120
00:11:34,737 --> 00:11:36,363
Even more important,

121
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,325
the night she was killed,

122
00:11:39,992 --> 00:11:43,579
that old woman saw Kwang-ho following her.

123
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:48,500
- Really?
- That's what I'm saying.

124
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:51,962
I heard that old hag
went senile last year.

125
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:54,006
No, she's fine.

126
00:11:59,303 --> 00:12:02,389
That kid... Wait.

127
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:05,851
Kwang-ho? What's he look like?

128
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:11,482
This side of his face is a bit...
you know.

129
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:14,318
Tell me in detail.

130
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:17,196
Anyways, he's a poor little kid.

131
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:43,430
Kwang-ho.

132
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:46,934
Let's talk man to man.

133
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:50,354
You see a pretty girl, you want to do her.

134
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:56,235
When I was your age,
I'd go out with friends, I understand.

135
00:12:56,902 --> 00:13:02,950
You never intended
to kill Hyang-sook at first, huh?

136
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:05,494
"How about just touching her breast..."

137
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:07,121
I couldn't touch it.

138
00:13:07,204 --> 00:13:09,957
So you killed her?
Kill her, then you can touch it.

139
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,208
No, I didn't.

140
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:19,091
That guy coming down now,
he's had a hard life, like you.

141
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:20,592
He's nice.

142
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:25,723
He's really sweet. He never beats anyone.

143
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:28,892
But sometimes, you know,

144
00:13:28,976 --> 00:13:32,104
if he gets worked up about something...

145
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:39,403
God, what an ugly face.

146
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:44,491
Just looking at this face makes me angry.

147
00:13:46,577 --> 00:13:47,870
Shit.

148
00:13:48,454 --> 00:13:50,622
Shit.

149
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:00,090
Pretty?

150
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:04,887
This is so it won't leave scratches,
you punk.

151
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:06,096
Hey, hey...

152
00:14:06,597 --> 00:14:08,432
What's with the army boots?

153
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:10,642
Doing this to the kid...

154
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,228
Kwang-ho, get up.

155
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:20,110
Are you really innocent? Huh?

156
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:22,446
Look in my eyes.

157
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:24,823
Huh?

158
00:14:24,907 --> 00:14:27,743
Where the hell's he looking?
Look in my eyes!

159
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:48,305
TURN YOURSELF IN,
OR MAY YOU ROT AND DIE.

160
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:08,575
Excuse me, miss...

161
00:15:09,493 --> 00:15:10,494
Hello?

162
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:14,206
Oh, miss?

163
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:16,625
Are you all right?

164
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:17,835
Why are you following me?

165
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:21,922
No, I just wanted to ask directions.

166
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:23,298
Let me help you.

167
00:15:26,385 --> 00:15:27,719
Let go!

168
00:15:27,803 --> 00:15:30,180
What's wrong?

169
00:15:30,806 --> 00:15:33,517
Rolling in the fields, huh?
Is this town a rapist's paradise?

170
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,644
You shithead.

171
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:43,443
What the hell?

172
00:15:43,527 --> 00:15:44,695
Who are you?

173
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:48,574
Get over here.

174
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:52,536
Hey, miss!
The victim needs to file a report!

175
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:55,956
Miss!

176
00:16:05,591 --> 00:16:07,259
Where is she going?

177
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:09,428
Are you a detective?

178
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:14,766
You should have told me.

179
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:17,269
My mistake.

180
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:20,981
How can a detective be such a bad fighter?

181
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:28,071
How can a detective have
such a bad eye for criminals?

182
00:16:32,451 --> 00:16:33,869
What's that smell?

183
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:37,581
Oh, sneakers. They smell bad?

184
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:41,877
But these here are evidence item #28.

185
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,696
Develop these quickly, huh?

186
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,952
- Uh, chief.
- What?

187
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:17,120
This guy here... from Seoul.

188
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:21,208
Nice to meet you! I got the call...

189
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:22,501
But...

190
00:17:23,335 --> 00:17:24,628
your face...

191
00:17:25,587 --> 00:17:27,923
Did anything happen?

192
00:17:28,632 --> 00:17:30,342
- No, nothing.
- A desk, you need...

193
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:33,845
Oh, I prepared a desk over there
with lots of sunlight.

194
00:17:35,639 --> 00:17:38,058
I think... I like that corner.

195
00:17:40,644 --> 00:17:42,729
Okay, okay! As you wish.

196
00:17:45,691 --> 00:17:47,526
Inspector Jo, say hello.

197
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:50,320
From Seoul,

198
00:17:50,946 --> 00:17:54,741
Seo Tae-... yoon, senior officer.

199
00:17:54,825 --> 00:17:56,785
Jo Yong-gu. 
Nice to meet you.

200
00:17:56,868 --> 00:18:00,455
He volunteered to assist
with this investigation.

201
00:18:00,956 --> 00:18:02,666
Quite an uncommon thing.

202
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:05,794
Well, go arrange your desk.

203
00:18:05,877 --> 00:18:07,504
Yes, sit down.

204
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:11,091
INSPECTOR CHIEF

205
00:18:23,562 --> 00:18:25,814
The song is great. The opening song.

206
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:29,151
I always watch <i>Inspector Chief</i> with Dad.

207
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:31,111
What was my phone number?

208
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:33,238
Just eat.

209
00:18:33,322 --> 00:18:36,033
Right, I need to call Dad!

210
00:18:36,908 --> 00:18:38,910
I should call. Oh, it's Dad!

211
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:50,047
Hey, Kwang-ho.

212
00:18:52,716 --> 00:18:53,800
Listen.

213
00:18:54,426 --> 00:18:58,638
This footprint was found
at the site of Hyang-sook's murder.

214
00:18:58,722 --> 00:18:59,723
Look.

215
00:19:00,265 --> 00:19:02,768
And these are sneakers
we found at your house.

216
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:05,062
You wear these? Right?

217
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:08,190
Now, look closely.

218
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:13,236
The footprint in this photo,
and the sole of your shoe.

219
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:15,364
The same, right?

220
00:19:15,906 --> 00:19:17,866
This pattern?

221
00:19:18,492 --> 00:19:22,662
The circle, this indentation?
Exactly the same.

222
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:24,956
Am I right?

223
00:19:25,957 --> 00:19:29,961
This part was smudged,
don't worry about that.

224
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:36,093
You killed all those women, right?

225
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:39,262
Okay.

226
00:19:40,555 --> 00:19:44,184
You didn't kill them all, right?

227
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:50,482
So you didn't <i>not</i> kill only Hyang-sook,
correct?

228
00:19:52,484 --> 00:19:53,693
I didn't kill anyone.

229
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:57,406
We've got the evidence here!

230
00:19:59,116 --> 00:20:01,201
- Where's our shovel?
- Shovel?

231
00:20:03,412 --> 00:20:05,789
Look at you...

232
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:10,419
Hey, bastard. Give me that.

233
00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:13,839
Can't you even shovel right? Watch me.

234
00:20:13,922 --> 00:20:17,509
Loosen the dirt first.
Then push with your foot.

235
00:20:17,592 --> 00:20:19,344
- Kwang-ho!
- Yes?

236
00:20:19,428 --> 00:20:21,638
You punk.

237
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:26,726
Did you come here to play?

238
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:29,062
You know where this is?

239
00:20:29,146 --> 00:20:30,730
We came here to bury you.

240
00:20:30,814 --> 00:20:34,651
- What? Why?
- Why?

241
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:37,070
Because you won't listen, you bastard.

242
00:20:37,154 --> 00:20:40,240
- I'm a good boy.
- Then tell me!

243
00:20:40,866 --> 00:20:44,244
Out here in the fresh air. With that face.

244
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:46,163
Hey, come here.

245
00:20:46,705 --> 00:20:49,958
Women hate this face, don't they?

246
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,878
They grimace and all fucking run away.

247
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:54,087
It's true.

248
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:56,381
I'll kill them all.

249
00:20:58,842 --> 00:21:02,637
Everyone who grimaces at my face.

250
00:21:03,638 --> 00:21:05,182
I'll kill them all.

251
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:11,480
Those women who grimace,
they're all in my head.

252
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:16,693
- Hyang-sook too?
- Hyang-sook?

253
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:19,571
Hyang-sook.
You always followed her around.

254
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:22,491
- Hyang-sook is pretty.
- Oh, yeah, she's pretty.

255
00:21:23,241 --> 00:21:25,994
But Hyang-sook grimaced too, huh?

256
00:21:26,077 --> 00:21:28,330
She said, "Fuck, get away!" didn't she?

257
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:31,208
Because you liked her.

258
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,792
So you killed her, huh?

259
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:44,679
By the train tracks. In that rice paddy.

260
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:47,599
The train tracks? Right.

261
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:51,019
Her throat. Hyang-sook's throat,

262
00:21:51,603 --> 00:21:55,106
strangled it tightly.

263
00:21:55,774 --> 00:21:57,859
- With what?
- Her brassiere.

264
00:21:57,943 --> 00:22:00,695
- Brassiere?
- With her white brassiere,

265
00:22:01,446 --> 00:22:05,116
strangled her tightly.

266
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,910
- And then?
- Her stocking.

267
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:09,621
- Her stocking?
- Pulled off her leg.

268
00:22:09,704 --> 00:22:11,414
Then it was the stocking.

269
00:22:11,498 --> 00:22:13,667
This guy's smart, huh?

270
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,170
- And then?
- What?

271
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:20,090
What was it?

272
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:22,842
Something with a strap?

273
00:22:24,302 --> 00:22:27,138
- A handbag strap?
- Right, a bag strap.

274
00:22:27,222 --> 00:22:34,604
Strangling Hyang-sook's throat
with it tightly.

275
00:22:36,398 --> 00:22:37,399
And?

276
00:22:38,275 --> 00:22:43,863
Then, Hyang-sook's body shook a bit.

277
00:22:44,781 --> 00:22:46,616
She looked completely dead.

278
00:22:47,492 --> 00:22:48,785
And then?

279
00:22:50,537 --> 00:22:54,624
Her head was covered up.

280
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:56,626
With what?

281
00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:04,551
Her panties.
Covered her head with her panties.

282
00:23:05,552 --> 00:23:08,597
Do you mean a girdle? That women wear?

283
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,849
Right, girdle!

284
00:23:10,932 --> 00:23:15,437
Looked like it covered her head right up.

285
00:23:16,771 --> 00:23:17,814
And then?

286
00:23:18,565 --> 00:23:20,942
Um... had to dress her again.

287
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,778
And why was that?

288
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:27,282
I don't know. Put the clothes back on.

289
00:23:27,365 --> 00:23:29,367
Why was that?

290
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:36,708
How would I know?

291
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:38,376
You were doing well!

292
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,462
Bastard! What did you do next?

293
00:23:40,545 --> 00:23:42,047
- Then... running!
- Where?

294
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:44,007
- It was raining!
- Where did you run?

295
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:47,844
- Kept running.
- Oh, you little shit!

296
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:49,346
The lightning struck!

297
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:53,475
Where the hell were you running,
you bastard!

298
00:23:53,558 --> 00:23:56,061
Yong-gu, start digging.

299
00:23:56,144 --> 00:23:57,270
Huh? Digging?

300
00:23:57,354 --> 00:23:59,397
Lightning!

301
00:24:20,043 --> 00:24:24,589
<i>Citizens, this is a civil defense drill.</i>

302
00:24:24,673 --> 00:24:27,550
<i>The air raid siren has begun to sound.
This is only a drill.</i>

303
00:24:27,634 --> 00:24:30,011
<i>The entire country is now
under a civil defense drill.</i>

304
00:24:30,095 --> 00:24:34,724
<i>A blackout is called for
in all buildings and houses.</i>

305
00:24:34,808 --> 00:24:38,061
<i>Please find cover
in the nearest underground space.</i>

306
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:47,404
<i>Follow the instructions
you hear in this broadcast.</i>

307
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:53,576
<i>Please move all flammable materials
to a safe place.</i>

308
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:58,873
<i>Unplug all cords,
then hurry to an underground area...</i>

309
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,050
Shut off the lights!

310
00:25:23,106 --> 00:25:25,108
You forgot the breasts.

311
00:25:25,734 --> 00:25:27,318
Hey, you!

312
00:25:28,069 --> 00:25:29,362
Come here.

313
00:25:32,574 --> 00:25:35,118
- Put this on. Everyone ready?
- Yes, sir.

314
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:36,619
Get in the car.

315
00:25:37,162 --> 00:25:38,455
Turn around.

316
00:25:38,955 --> 00:25:40,039
LEE HYANG-SOOK

317
00:25:40,123 --> 00:25:43,001
Take off your pants.

318
00:25:45,128 --> 00:25:46,546
What'll the headline be?

319
00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:50,258
"Crime-Fighting Trio"
or "Smiles of the Unstoppable."

320
00:25:50,341 --> 00:25:52,260
Inspector Park, in the back.

321
00:25:52,343 --> 00:25:55,138
Make a straight line now.

322
00:25:56,347 --> 00:25:59,184
Miss Kwon, big party tonight!
Reserve a room.

323
00:25:59,267 --> 00:26:01,686
Smile! Okay!

324
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:04,856
This time, hold up your fist. Tight!

325
00:26:07,484 --> 00:26:10,195
- Come take a picture!
- That's okay.

326
00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:11,821
Come on!

327
00:26:17,452 --> 00:26:18,828
Wait a second.

328
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:32,008
With these webbed fingers,
you can't even hold chopsticks, right?

329
00:26:32,842 --> 00:26:34,552
They've always been this way?

330
00:26:44,229 --> 00:26:47,899
- Kwang-ho, this is the spot, right?
- I don't know.

331
00:26:47,982 --> 00:26:50,819
What's he talking about? It was here.

332
00:26:52,153 --> 00:26:55,114
For the reenactment, you have to act well.

333
00:26:55,198 --> 00:26:58,827
There are a lot of reporters here.

334
00:26:59,244 --> 00:27:00,245
How's this?

335
00:27:00,328 --> 00:27:02,038
A bit lower.

336
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:04,749
- What do we start with?
- Wait.

337
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:09,796
It's best to write down the correct order.

338
00:27:09,879 --> 00:27:12,340
Then why didn't you do it?
I'm fucking busy.

339
00:27:12,423 --> 00:27:13,842
Chief.

340
00:27:14,676 --> 00:27:17,929
The reenactment
isn't going to work anyway.

341
00:27:18,888 --> 00:27:21,933
Call it off before
it becomes an embarrassment.

342
00:27:22,016 --> 00:27:26,771
Hey, I told you to stay away.
Why'd you come back here?

343
00:27:26,855 --> 00:27:29,566
Just give them some excuse.
The suspect is sick, or...

344
00:27:29,649 --> 00:27:30,859
Inspector Seo!

345
00:27:32,235 --> 00:27:35,572
You're dumping shit on cooked rice here!

346
00:27:35,655 --> 00:27:38,491
I told you before, Kwang-ho isn't guilty.

347
00:27:38,575 --> 00:27:39,951
Just shut up!

348
00:27:40,577 --> 00:27:42,161
Chief...

349
00:27:42,245 --> 00:27:46,583
The cords around their necks
were tied with three tight knots.

350
00:27:46,666 --> 00:27:49,878
Look at Kwang-ho's hands.
Could he do that?

351
00:27:49,961 --> 00:27:51,629
- Get out!
- Even a child can see that.

352
00:27:51,713 --> 00:27:53,381
Get the hell out!

353
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:57,343
Grab the brassiere strap...

354
00:27:57,427 --> 00:28:00,889
- Hey, concentrate!
- Dad!

355
00:28:00,972 --> 00:28:04,100
Kwang-ho! It's me!

356
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:05,518
Dad!

357
00:28:05,602 --> 00:28:09,772
- Hey, you're innocent!
- I know! I didn't do it!

358
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:15,570
Mr. Baek Kwang-ho!
Are you denying a crime?

359
00:28:16,362 --> 00:28:20,199
He didn't kill anyone! My son's innocent!

360
00:28:22,452 --> 00:28:26,164
You were tortured, weren't you?

361
00:28:26,247 --> 00:28:29,709
My team never tortures suspects.

362
00:28:42,722 --> 00:28:44,140
It's all gone to hell.

363
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:45,892
Don't bring it up.

364
00:28:47,018 --> 00:28:51,940
Hey, did you see the look
on prosecutor Choi's face back there?

365
00:28:53,024 --> 00:28:56,152
Fuck, how can he revoke the warrant?

366
00:28:56,653 --> 00:28:58,237
We even had evidence.

367
00:28:58,321 --> 00:29:00,782
Evidence? That footprint?

368
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:05,828
How can they set him free?

369
00:29:05,912 --> 00:29:07,330
What can we do?

370
00:29:08,456 --> 00:29:11,459
All we had was a confession.

371
00:29:11,542 --> 00:29:15,797
It was no ordinary confession.
You heard the tape.

372
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:19,884
All the details of the crime
came pouring out his mouth.

373
00:29:20,885 --> 00:29:24,889
Things he'd never know
if he weren't the killer.

374
00:29:24,973 --> 00:29:26,683
Like how she was strangled.

375
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:30,186
You heard it too.

376
00:29:30,812 --> 00:29:33,606
Be honest,
didn't you rehearse that in advance?

377
00:29:34,023 --> 00:29:35,149
What?

378
00:29:35,233 --> 00:29:36,943
Quiet. Eat something.

379
00:29:37,026 --> 00:29:38,027
Jesus...

380
00:29:44,075 --> 00:29:48,287
What? I said to separate
the noodles and bean sauce.

381
00:29:49,622 --> 00:29:51,708
What the fuck!

382
00:29:53,001 --> 00:29:57,171
INVESTIGATIVE TEAM RESHUFFLED

383
00:29:57,255 --> 00:30:01,467
MURDER CASE SHROUDED
IN MYSTERY ONCE AGAIN

384
00:30:19,527 --> 00:30:23,865
The location of the first homicide,

385
00:30:23,948 --> 00:30:25,950
and the second homicide.

386
00:30:26,034 --> 00:30:28,411
Now, a distance of...

387
00:30:29,912 --> 00:30:31,831
approximately 1000 meters.

388
00:30:31,914 --> 00:30:35,585
A length of not more than...
one kilometer.

389
00:30:44,218 --> 00:30:49,057
The victim, on the 12th and the 16th,

390
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:53,061
both days at twelve o'clock...

391
00:30:53,978 --> 00:30:57,565
Ah, December 16th.

392
00:30:57,648 --> 00:31:01,652
On December 16th, at twelve o'clock...

393
00:31:02,862 --> 00:31:06,074
The location is Yangji Teahouse...

394
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:09,202
Han Sung-geun,

395
00:31:09,702 --> 00:31:12,580
a 32-year-old office worker.

396
00:31:14,123 --> 00:31:17,710
An arranged date, maybe?

397
00:31:19,462 --> 00:31:22,799
Anyway, at the crime site

398
00:31:22,882 --> 00:31:27,512
were found a footprint,
two drops of blood,

399
00:31:27,595 --> 00:31:31,849
and a drop of semen.
Semen? They found semen?

400
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:33,684
What? Yes.

401
00:31:37,438 --> 00:31:39,232
The two dead women,

402
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:41,943
did they have anything in common?

403
00:31:43,903 --> 00:31:45,655
In common...

404
00:31:45,738 --> 00:31:47,323
Well, first,

405
00:31:47,865 --> 00:31:50,993
both of them were single.

406
00:31:53,121 --> 00:31:55,498
They were both extremely beautiful.

407
00:31:56,499 --> 00:31:57,500
And?

408
00:31:59,627 --> 00:32:01,629
The murders all took place in the rain.

409
00:32:03,297 --> 00:32:04,549
Rain?

410
00:32:04,632 --> 00:32:06,634
He murdered them on rainy nights.

411
00:32:08,052 --> 00:32:09,303
Really?

412
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,139
And red clothes.

413
00:32:11,722 --> 00:32:14,058
They all wore red clothes.

414
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:15,852
Both of them?

415
00:32:16,602 --> 00:32:17,979
No, all three of them.

416
00:32:19,897 --> 00:32:21,190
Three of them?

417
00:32:21,774 --> 00:32:23,109
What are you talking about?

418
00:32:23,192 --> 00:32:26,946
Three were murdered.
We just haven't found the third body.

419
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,537
This is a missing person form.
The name is quite unusual.

420
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:38,499
Dokko Hyun-soon, age 27.
It was two months ago, July 18.

421
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:42,712
Oh, her? Dokko Hyun-soon?
I know that girl.

422
00:32:42,795 --> 00:32:46,174
Everyone in this town knows her.

423
00:32:46,257 --> 00:32:49,177
A pretty girl, that Hyun-soon.

424
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:52,597
Even a Miss Korea is no match for her.

425
00:32:53,139 --> 00:32:55,933
Did you process the missing person form,
Yong-gu?

426
00:32:56,017 --> 00:32:57,393
Oh, shut up.

427
00:32:58,644 --> 00:33:00,938
This is no ordinary incident, Chief.

428
00:33:01,022 --> 00:33:04,942
If you look in detail,
documents never lie.

429
00:33:05,026 --> 00:33:09,155
It says she was wearing a red shirt.

430
00:33:09,238 --> 00:33:11,032
It's right here in writing.

431
00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:12,950
What's that?

432
00:33:13,034 --> 00:33:17,205
Marked here is the weather
on the day she vanished.

433
00:33:17,288 --> 00:33:19,707
It rained on that day too.

434
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:23,044
Rain, red clothes...

435
00:33:24,045 --> 00:33:26,881
She was murdered. By the same person.

436
00:33:26,964 --> 00:33:30,801
You don't know this town,
that's why you talk nonsense.

437
00:33:30,885 --> 00:33:35,056
She always said she'd go
to Seoul one day...

438
00:33:35,139 --> 00:33:39,227
I have an idea where the body is.
Look at the map.

439
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:41,646
Right here...

440
00:33:41,729 --> 00:33:46,234
I marked where the victim went,
and where the body might be.

441
00:33:48,945 --> 00:33:52,615
Give me two squadrons of cops.
I'll find her in two days.

442
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,620
You sure of this?

443
00:34:17,181 --> 00:34:18,432
You know,

444
00:34:18,516 --> 00:34:22,478
university students,
when they go on orientation,

445
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:24,855
people say the guys all get laid.

446
00:34:25,523 --> 00:34:30,403
A big group, guys and girls,
in one room going at it...

447
00:34:30,486 --> 00:34:31,988
Is that true?

448
00:34:32,822 --> 00:34:34,949
I don't know. Hurry up.

449
00:34:36,284 --> 00:34:39,829
You went to a two-year school, didn't you?

450
00:34:39,912 --> 00:34:44,208
Student trips, orientation...
Did you go on those?

451
00:34:46,002 --> 00:34:50,172
Go ask Seo.
He went to a four-year university.

452
00:34:50,256 --> 00:34:51,757
Whether he had group sex...

453
00:34:52,425 --> 00:34:54,302
Shit, four years.

454
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:58,014
I spent four years in high school.

455
00:35:04,061 --> 00:35:05,730
Shit, put that away.

456
00:35:08,357 --> 00:35:11,068
You know, I miss Dokko Hyun-soon.

457
00:35:11,485 --> 00:35:12,486
You too?

458
00:35:13,487 --> 00:35:16,907
She was just too good for this town.

459
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:20,411
I'm telling you, she went to Seoul.

460
00:35:23,122 --> 00:35:24,332
What is it?

461
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:27,460
Lot of snakes down there.

462
00:35:33,382 --> 00:35:36,177
Each part of a corpse
decays at a different speed.

463
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:41,015
Look. It's old,
but the inner thigh is still firm.

464
00:35:42,308 --> 00:35:43,893
There's evidence of rape?

465
00:35:44,518 --> 00:35:46,354
A bit of semen was found.

466
00:35:47,521 --> 00:35:50,858
But it's so old,
we can't determine the blood type.

467
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:52,818
Oh, Hyun-soon...

468
00:35:53,736 --> 00:35:57,865
This time too he used
items belonging to her.

469
00:35:57,948 --> 00:36:00,785
Right, that's her stocking
around the throat?

470
00:36:01,285 --> 00:36:02,620
Yes.

471
00:36:02,703 --> 00:36:07,917
The victim's panties on her face,
as with Hyang-sook.

472
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,336
Her hands were bound the same way too.

473
00:36:10,419 --> 00:36:14,590
His methods of killing
are quite professional.

474
00:36:15,633 --> 00:36:17,218
He's thorough.

475
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,969
And polished.

476
00:36:21,514 --> 00:36:26,685
So there hasn't been a single witness yet.

477
00:36:29,105 --> 00:36:31,732
Would you like a bit more tenderloin?

478
00:36:32,608 --> 00:36:35,111
That's okay. We're fine.

479
00:36:35,194 --> 00:36:38,239
Where did Kwang-ho go? I don't see him.

480
00:36:39,824 --> 00:36:40,908
Is anything...?

481
00:36:41,492 --> 00:36:46,539
I bought your son something,
give it to him later.

482
00:36:46,622 --> 00:36:48,332
What's this?

483
00:36:48,416 --> 00:36:51,669
Oh, last time,
taking a look at his sneakers,

484
00:36:51,752 --> 00:36:54,922
they smelled so awful, I felt bad for him.

485
00:36:55,005 --> 00:36:58,843
I thought, I'll have to buy him new shoes.

486
00:36:58,926 --> 00:37:00,928
So I picked up some Nikes.

487
00:37:01,011 --> 00:37:02,805
You didn't have to...

488
00:37:04,014 --> 00:37:07,268
That punk, he's always sleeping
in the strangest places!

489
00:37:10,146 --> 00:37:11,188
Kwang-ho!

490
00:37:13,441 --> 00:37:15,860
This here...
your shoe size is 250 mm, right?

491
00:37:15,943 --> 00:37:18,863
Here, Nike. Try them on.

492
00:37:20,531 --> 00:37:23,075
Give me that sneaker.

493
00:37:24,452 --> 00:37:27,621
These are "Nice," not Nike. N, I, C, E.

494
00:37:27,705 --> 00:37:30,958
Nice or Nike. Who cares?

495
00:37:32,042 --> 00:37:37,381
If you buy him sneakers,
you should get the real thing.

496
00:37:37,465 --> 00:37:39,258
Cool, huh?

497
00:37:44,388 --> 00:37:45,556
Have a drink.

498
00:37:46,474 --> 00:37:49,268
I beat you because I care for you.

499
00:37:49,351 --> 00:37:54,023
So if you see me on the street,
don't run away.

500
00:37:54,106 --> 00:37:56,400
Yong-gu feels bad about...

501
00:37:58,777 --> 00:37:59,778
Punk.

502
00:38:05,743 --> 00:38:08,454
Hey, where are you going again?

503
00:38:10,247 --> 00:38:11,332
You see, Chief.

504
00:38:11,415 --> 00:38:15,878
That boy is the exact opposite
of the type we're looking for.

505
00:38:16,337 --> 00:38:19,548
Dragging in suspects like that
is a waste of time, so...

506
00:38:19,632 --> 00:38:20,674
Inspector Seo!

507
00:38:22,676 --> 00:38:25,346
Have some meat before you speak.

508
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:32,561
I don't eat burnt meat.

509
00:38:33,938 --> 00:38:36,482
<i>When the Spring flower blooms</i>

510
00:38:36,565 --> 00:38:40,236
<i>You said you'd come back to me</i>

511
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:45,824
<i>Like the singing swallows</i>

512
00:38:47,535 --> 00:38:50,162
<i>On the hills</i>

513
00:38:50,246 --> 00:38:53,457
<i>Singing birds and blooming flowers...</i>

514
00:39:03,425 --> 00:39:04,593
Sir?

515
00:39:08,556 --> 00:39:12,643
<i>Alone on the hill</i>

516
00:39:13,894 --> 00:39:15,521
Hey, Seoul city bumpkin.

517
00:39:18,399 --> 00:39:19,400
What?

518
00:39:20,776 --> 00:39:22,570
Why did you come here?

519
00:39:22,653 --> 00:39:26,407
Out to the boondocks? Huh?

520
00:39:29,201 --> 00:39:30,703
To catch the killer.

521
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:38,002
Is Seoul that big?

522
00:39:39,253 --> 00:39:40,629
Huh? Is it big?

523
00:39:43,007 --> 00:39:44,425
Bigger than America?

524
00:39:46,677 --> 00:39:49,638
Give me a banana.

525
00:39:53,017 --> 00:39:54,810
Let me tell you about America.

526
00:39:57,313 --> 00:39:59,648
They've got the FBI!

527
00:40:00,858 --> 00:40:03,819
If you watch how they investigate...
You know how?

528
00:40:07,072 --> 00:40:09,491
Their heads are spinning like a top.

529
00:40:10,784 --> 00:40:12,494
Analyzing things...

530
00:40:13,996 --> 00:40:15,331
You know why?

531
00:40:16,332 --> 00:40:19,793
It's cause they got so much fucking land!

532
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:26,925
If you don't use your brain,
it's too much ground to cover.

533
00:40:27,009 --> 00:40:31,805
So they have no choice,
those FBI bastards.

534
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:36,060
But our Republic of Korea...

535
00:40:38,562 --> 00:40:42,816
using just your two legs,
you can run all over it.

536
00:40:43,651 --> 00:40:44,818
You know why?

537
00:40:46,028 --> 00:40:48,656
Cause our land's the size of my dick.

538
00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:55,245
So it's said, Korean detectives
investigate with their feet.

539
00:40:55,329 --> 00:40:58,957
That's folk wisdom, you bastard.

540
00:40:59,375 --> 00:41:03,170
So brainy geeks like you
can go the hell to America.

541
00:41:03,253 --> 00:41:07,174
- Go there and...
- Shut your fucking mouth!

542
00:41:09,718 --> 00:41:11,178
You bastard!

543
00:41:12,513 --> 00:41:15,099
- Let go of me!
- What? You f...

544
00:41:23,399 --> 00:41:24,775
Give him this.

545
00:41:29,279 --> 00:41:31,824
Take it away! Take it!

546
00:41:39,498 --> 00:41:43,836
Everything's clearer now.
That's much better.

547
00:41:46,338 --> 00:41:49,717
I've got it now. About the killer.

548
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:52,720
That bastard,

549
00:41:53,387 --> 00:41:55,889
he'll do it again.

550
00:41:56,306 --> 00:41:58,642
The next night it rains.

551
00:41:59,268 --> 00:42:03,439
So we need to keep one step ahead of him.

552
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:06,817
Preemptive! Okay?

553
00:42:09,278 --> 00:42:13,657
And if you two ever start
fighting in front of me again,

554
00:42:13,741 --> 00:42:17,202
I'll kill you both! Understood?

555
00:42:32,551 --> 00:42:34,178
Ladies and gentlemen!

556
00:42:34,261 --> 00:42:37,306
In just a moment,
our President will be driving past.

557
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:39,141
Wait a minute...

558
00:42:59,703 --> 00:43:01,622
It's raining nice.

559
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:04,416
You ready?

560
00:43:40,494 --> 00:43:44,248
Ooh, Gwi-ok's looking nice!

561
00:43:44,331 --> 00:43:45,541
Shut up.

562
00:43:48,418 --> 00:43:51,463
What if he grabs her for real?

563
00:43:51,547 --> 00:43:57,678
Inspector Seo should be
following close behind her.

564
00:43:57,761 --> 00:44:03,809
Shit, do we have to do this
every time when it rains?

565
00:44:04,434 --> 00:44:09,106
But thanks to this,
Gwi-ok puts on that red skirt.

566
00:44:09,189 --> 00:44:12,442
With makeup,
she looks like a different person.

567
00:44:13,151 --> 00:44:14,945
- So what?
- Was she always that pretty?

568
00:44:15,028 --> 00:44:16,071
You getting hard?

569
00:44:16,154 --> 00:44:18,198
- Wait, what are you doing?
- Let's check.

570
00:44:18,282 --> 00:44:20,117
- We're on duty now...
- Oh, Yong-gu!

571
00:44:29,293 --> 00:44:30,294
Hey.

572
00:44:31,587 --> 00:44:33,589
So do you really keep watch here?

573
00:44:34,882 --> 00:44:37,467
These days, nobody ever goes outside.

574
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,179
Someone's coming.

575
00:44:42,556 --> 00:44:44,725
Hey, kids! Hey, kids!

576
00:44:46,643 --> 00:44:47,728
Over here.

577
00:44:50,689 --> 00:44:52,024
That's cold.

578
00:44:52,441 --> 00:44:53,817
You're so wet!

579
00:44:57,154 --> 00:45:00,449
Hey, stay here until the rain stops.

580
00:45:01,658 --> 00:45:03,160
That umbrella's useless.

581
00:45:03,243 --> 00:45:05,495
And we just picked it up
in front of the school.

582
00:45:05,954 --> 00:45:07,956
Someone threw it away.

583
00:45:08,457 --> 00:45:10,834
Miss, are you going that way too?

584
00:45:10,918 --> 00:45:12,836
Hey, she's a detective.

585
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,421
No way!

586
00:45:14,504 --> 00:45:16,840
She's in the Violent Crimes Division.

587
00:45:16,924 --> 00:45:18,759
- Really?
- Sure.

588
00:45:18,842 --> 00:45:21,553
Wait a minute. We'll give you a ride.

589
00:45:21,637 --> 00:45:23,555
Wow, in a police car!

590
00:45:23,639 --> 00:45:28,769
Hey, you two.
What are you doing out so late?

591
00:45:28,852 --> 00:45:31,396
We always stay together, so it's okay.

592
00:45:32,648 --> 00:45:34,942
You'll be fine even if you go alone.

593
00:45:37,778 --> 00:45:41,531
Nam-ju, tell them about
what you heard at school.

594
00:45:41,615 --> 00:45:42,616
What?

595
00:45:42,699 --> 00:45:45,452
You know, during cleaning time,
about the murderer.

596
00:45:45,535 --> 00:45:49,414
Right! You know why
they can't catch the murderer?

597
00:45:49,498 --> 00:45:52,542
This is the truth.
We go to Ansong Girls Middle School.

598
00:45:52,626 --> 00:45:54,586
Behind our school, there's an outhouse.

599
00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:58,674
They say a crazy man lives under there,
the murderer!

600
00:45:58,757 --> 00:46:00,050
He stays there all day,

601
00:46:00,133 --> 00:46:03,345
and when night comes,
he sneaks out and kills women.

602
00:46:04,805 --> 00:46:06,765
So when he comes out at night,

603
00:46:06,848 --> 00:46:10,686
you must be able to smell
the shit from miles away.

604
00:46:12,688 --> 00:46:13,939
That's not the story.

605
00:46:14,022 --> 00:46:17,401
Yoo-jin said a crazy woman
fell in there and died.

606
00:46:17,484 --> 00:46:20,404
Then I'll meet you in front of the factory
with an umbrella.

607
00:46:22,239 --> 00:46:24,366
It's okay.

608
00:46:25,701 --> 00:46:26,827
Okay.

609
00:46:27,452 --> 00:46:30,622
I'll see you soon.

610
00:46:39,715 --> 00:46:47,597
<i>Stand by me, don't leave me</i>

611
00:46:47,681 --> 00:46:53,770
<i>I still love you</i>

612
00:46:55,022 --> 00:46:59,192
<i>Walking by myself...</i>

613
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:48,343
Hello?

614
00:48:51,221 --> 00:48:53,640
Everyone stay where you are!

615
00:48:54,307 --> 00:48:58,770
Don't touch anything near you.
Don't move one step!

616
00:48:59,187 --> 00:49:00,564
Hey, you!

617
00:49:00,647 --> 00:49:01,940
I'm talking to you!

618
00:49:02,023 --> 00:49:04,401
Wait for the forensics team.

619
00:49:16,538 --> 00:49:17,539
Look!

620
00:49:17,956 --> 00:49:20,542
These are genuine footprints.

621
00:49:21,877 --> 00:49:25,380
You see the Remicon factory there?

622
00:49:25,463 --> 00:49:29,217
He caught her near the factory,

623
00:49:29,843 --> 00:49:33,388
and quietly pulled her
over 400 meters to here.

624
00:49:35,807 --> 00:49:39,644
The footprints look
like a bride and groom's.

625
00:49:41,021 --> 00:49:46,026
But you didn't find anything,
aside from the footprints?

626
00:49:47,694 --> 00:49:52,157
I hoped to find fingerprints
on the umbrella, but no luck.

627
00:49:52,699 --> 00:49:57,495
Not only that, due to the rain,
the footprints are all smudged.

628
00:49:59,539 --> 00:50:02,542
Even after such a thorough investigation,
nothing.

629
00:50:06,504 --> 00:50:10,884
Therefore, Chief,
I think this could be a hint. Hint!

630
00:50:11,384 --> 00:50:12,677
What?

631
00:50:12,761 --> 00:50:17,390
The fact that we found nothing
at the scene.

632
00:50:19,392 --> 00:50:21,519
Always in rape cases,

633
00:50:21,937 --> 00:50:24,522
at the crime scene,

634
00:50:24,606 --> 00:50:28,985
there's one or two
of those hairs left behind.

635
00:50:29,069 --> 00:50:30,487
So?

636
00:50:31,029 --> 00:50:36,952
I'm saying the criminal
must not have any hair down there.

637
00:50:37,035 --> 00:50:38,828
You mean hairless?

638
00:50:38,912 --> 00:50:43,041
That's right, hairless. A total baldy.

639
00:50:45,126 --> 00:50:50,048
He can't leave hair behind,
because he doesn't have any?

640
00:50:50,632 --> 00:50:51,967
For example,

641
00:50:52,467 --> 00:50:56,429
a Buddhist monk
who shaved the hair down there.

642
00:50:56,513 --> 00:50:57,973
It's a perfect crime.

643
00:50:58,556 --> 00:50:59,849
Well, then.

644
00:51:00,809 --> 00:51:04,688
Yongdeok Temple is just next door.

645
00:51:04,771 --> 00:51:06,398
Should we start there?

646
00:51:13,989 --> 00:51:17,867
Hey, Gwi-ok,
you've got the radio on over there.

647
00:51:19,703 --> 00:51:22,038
How would you like your coffee?

648
00:51:22,122 --> 00:51:24,082
Lots of sugar for me.

649
00:51:25,083 --> 00:51:27,585
- Inspector Seo!
- Yes, sir?

650
00:51:28,086 --> 00:51:31,047
Do you have any more ideas?

651
00:51:32,048 --> 00:51:36,845
I don't know. As you saw today,
this criminal is flawless.

652
00:51:37,429 --> 00:51:39,597
- So?
- Therefore,

653
00:51:39,681 --> 00:51:42,851
our standard procedures
aren't going to help.

654
00:51:42,934 --> 00:51:45,937
So what are we going to do?

655
00:51:47,939 --> 00:51:49,274
Jesus...

656
00:51:49,357 --> 00:51:52,694
Excuse me,
but I've got something to show you.

657
00:51:55,822 --> 00:51:59,117
What will she show us today?

658
00:52:01,494 --> 00:52:02,704
What's this?

659
00:52:03,496 --> 00:52:06,541
These are documents
from an FM radio station.

660
00:52:06,624 --> 00:52:09,544
Looks like a broadcast schedule.

661
00:52:09,627 --> 00:52:13,506
Yes, it's an evening music program
I listen to.

662
00:52:14,049 --> 00:52:19,054
There's someone who keeps requesting
the song "Sad Letter."

663
00:52:19,512 --> 00:52:22,640
If you look, it lists the dates
this song was broadcast.

664
00:52:23,391 --> 00:52:27,729
Actually, this isn't a very popular song.
It's quite rare.

665
00:52:27,812 --> 00:52:29,439
A song? What letter?

666
00:52:29,522 --> 00:52:32,859
"Sad Letter." The singer is Yoo Jae-ha.

667
00:52:34,444 --> 00:52:35,987
Jo Young-pil's band.

668
00:52:36,071 --> 00:52:38,365
- Sure, I heard it.
- So?

669
00:52:40,533 --> 00:52:45,872
The song was broadcast
on the same days of the murders here.

670
00:52:48,833 --> 00:52:49,876
Look.

671
00:52:50,794 --> 00:52:53,713
October 20. That's Park Bo-hee's murder.

672
00:52:53,797 --> 00:52:58,551
December 19 was Lee Hyang-sook.

673
00:52:59,427 --> 00:53:04,808
So... on last night's murder too,
this song was broadcast?

674
00:53:05,308 --> 00:53:08,103
Yes. I listened to it myself.

675
00:53:09,229 --> 00:53:12,607
The DJ read out the postcard
containing the request.

676
00:53:13,691 --> 00:53:16,820
"Sent by a lonely man
from Terung District.

677
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:19,823
Please broadcast it on a rainy day."

678
00:53:23,243 --> 00:53:26,037
Miss Kwon, nice! Good idea!

679
00:53:26,913 --> 00:53:29,457
You read too many mystery novels
as a student?

680
00:53:30,417 --> 00:53:32,585
That was a nice story.

681
00:53:34,003 --> 00:53:39,092
Chief, this can't be a coincidence.
Look at this. Documents never lie.

682
00:53:39,175 --> 00:53:42,262
Christ, here we go again.

683
00:53:42,345 --> 00:53:45,598
It seems he's a real psycho.

684
00:53:46,349 --> 00:53:48,935
As soon as he hears the song,
he goes crazy.

685
00:53:49,018 --> 00:53:53,440
Oh, Chief, now you're doing it too.
This makes no sense!

686
00:53:53,523 --> 00:53:56,317
It does make sense, sir!
It's quite simple.

687
00:53:56,401 --> 00:54:00,780
Assemblies start with the National Anthem.
It's the same.

688
00:54:00,864 --> 00:54:02,782
Did you get the postcard?

689
00:54:02,866 --> 00:54:05,160
I requested it,

690
00:54:05,577 --> 00:54:08,037
but the radio station's
a bit disorganized.

691
00:54:10,457 --> 00:54:12,083
Find it quickly.

692
00:54:12,167 --> 00:54:14,961
Check the postmark,
fingerprints and handwriting.

693
00:54:15,044 --> 00:54:16,171
Yes, sir!

694
00:54:16,254 --> 00:54:19,966
Officer Kwon,
call the station and follow up on this.

695
00:54:26,181 --> 00:54:27,390
Baldies!

696
00:54:28,057 --> 00:54:30,435
- What about that?
- Huh?

697
00:54:30,518 --> 00:54:32,729
What we mentioned before...

698
00:54:32,812 --> 00:54:34,063
Hairless, sir!

699
00:54:34,522 --> 00:54:36,566
How do you investigate?

700
00:54:36,649 --> 00:54:39,611
Pull the pants off passing men?

701
00:54:52,248 --> 00:54:56,794
The postcard from yesterday.
I asked you to keep it!

702
00:54:56,878 --> 00:54:58,963
What postcard?

703
00:54:59,047 --> 00:55:01,049
You read it on the air yesterday!

704
00:55:01,132 --> 00:55:02,842
Look how many we get here!

705
00:55:05,470 --> 00:55:06,471
Hey, mister!

706
00:55:07,931 --> 00:55:09,682
Nothing. Get dressed.

707
00:55:11,893 --> 00:55:12,894
Inspector.

708
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:16,814
They've already
carted off yesterday's trash.

709
00:55:16,898 --> 00:55:18,900
It's no use.

710
00:55:33,623 --> 00:55:35,833
You're not going to shower?

711
00:55:37,961 --> 00:55:39,629
Enough showers, for God's sake.

712
00:55:41,047 --> 00:55:44,592
My skin feels like it'll burst.

713
00:55:45,593 --> 00:55:48,012
You couldn't find any hairless men?

714
00:55:50,723 --> 00:55:54,310
Like looking for dog's horns.
Just paid sauna fees.

715
00:55:54,727 --> 00:55:57,272
Shit, can't even get reimbursed.

716
00:55:57,689 --> 00:56:00,483
At least your face is clean.

717
00:56:01,067 --> 00:56:05,738
How many times in a day...
dressing, undressing, dressing...

718
00:56:06,656 --> 00:56:08,283
I'll lose my hair there too.

719
00:56:14,122 --> 00:56:18,126
I asked the workers at the sauna there

720
00:56:18,209 --> 00:56:20,086
to call me if they saw anyone.

721
00:56:20,169 --> 00:56:24,424
Bastards just smirked at me.

722
00:56:26,426 --> 00:56:30,013
Don't do it all yourself,
have someone else do it.

723
00:56:33,516 --> 00:56:37,312
What's that guy from Seoul
doing these days?

724
00:56:39,647 --> 00:56:43,026
- Researching pop songs.
- What?

725
00:56:44,110 --> 00:56:46,237
Shit, it's nothing you've heard of.

726
00:56:46,696 --> 00:56:49,032
Is he still talking nonsense?

727
00:56:49,866 --> 00:56:51,284
Driving me crazy.

728
00:56:53,286 --> 00:56:56,998
If you feel that way, go see a shaman.

729
00:56:58,625 --> 00:56:59,626
A shaman?

730
00:57:00,209 --> 00:57:03,630
Sure, one that tells fortunes well.

731
00:57:04,213 --> 00:57:08,551
Ask her where the murderer is hiding.

732
00:57:16,309 --> 00:57:18,645
A problem at the main gate
of the police station.

733
00:57:19,479 --> 00:57:23,650
It should be moved about
10 meters to the southwest.

734
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:30,239
A face just passed by me.
I think he's the one.

735
00:57:37,747 --> 00:57:41,417
Is his face among these pictures here?

736
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:45,380
Take those dirty photos away.

737
00:57:45,963 --> 00:57:48,675
- Hey, just look...
- Put them away!

738
00:57:50,385 --> 00:57:52,095
It's bad fortune.

739
00:57:54,889 --> 00:58:00,144
- Take this, and do what I say.
- Don't try to sell that charm.

740
00:58:18,871 --> 00:58:21,290
Wait, wait a minute.

741
00:58:25,336 --> 00:58:28,256
You have to mix in dirt
from the crime scene.

742
00:58:29,257 --> 00:58:30,341
Stir.

743
00:58:31,718 --> 00:58:33,386
She said that was most important.

744
00:58:34,887 --> 00:58:36,097
Now pour it.

745
00:58:41,102 --> 00:58:42,103
Stop.

746
00:58:44,731 --> 00:58:46,232
Good.

747
00:58:53,656 --> 00:58:55,742
Once this dries,

748
00:58:55,825 --> 00:59:00,580
this stain will form
the shape of the murderer's face.

749
00:59:01,038 --> 00:59:02,707
That's ridiculous.

750
00:59:02,790 --> 00:59:04,792
Quiet, you'll break the charm.

751
00:59:04,876 --> 00:59:06,544
Know how much this costs?

752
00:59:07,336 --> 00:59:08,796
So shut up!

753
00:59:15,762 --> 00:59:16,846
Who's that?

754
00:59:19,348 --> 00:59:20,683
You've heard?

755
00:59:21,267 --> 00:59:23,853
Criminals always return
to the crime scene.

756
00:59:58,846 --> 01:00:00,223
Wait a sec.

757
01:00:01,307 --> 01:00:02,892
What the...

758
01:00:04,268 --> 01:00:05,853
What's he doing here?

759
01:00:06,270 --> 01:00:07,647
Why'd he come?

760
01:00:23,412 --> 01:00:25,206
What the fuck...

761
01:00:26,624 --> 01:00:29,335
We need science here!

762
01:00:32,046 --> 01:00:33,881
What the hell's that?

763
01:00:40,346 --> 01:00:42,598
Still, he's got style.

764
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:20,798
Stop there!

765
01:03:24,093 --> 01:03:25,511
Hey, you!

766
01:03:36,063 --> 01:03:39,608
It's getting narrow! Single file!

767
01:04:03,549 --> 01:04:06,552
Miss, did a strange man
just run past here?

768
01:04:06,635 --> 01:04:07,636
No.

769
01:04:09,096 --> 01:04:11,974
- It's that policeman.
- What?

770
01:04:12,058 --> 01:04:14,727
- At the guard post.
- You know him?

771
01:04:15,561 --> 01:04:18,898
Damn, he's a fast little bastard.

772
01:04:20,983 --> 01:04:23,569
He's not there?

773
01:04:26,447 --> 01:04:29,492
Did you check the alleys properly?

774
01:04:29,575 --> 01:04:31,702
You think you know this village?

775
01:04:32,787 --> 01:04:34,205
You stepped on a stick back there.

776
01:04:34,288 --> 01:04:37,166
A stick or a shit pile, who cares?

777
01:04:37,249 --> 01:04:39,376
He stepped on it.

778
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:46,801
What?

779
01:04:47,593 --> 01:04:49,386
Over there... Hey, you!

780
01:05:00,648 --> 01:05:01,649
Stop!

781
01:05:08,864 --> 01:05:11,033
Jesus, not again.

782
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:15,287
Hey, over there.

783
01:05:44,024 --> 01:05:47,319
Black clothes, black clothes...

784
01:05:47,403 --> 01:05:49,405
Everyone's in black except you.

785
01:06:00,666 --> 01:06:02,251
Everybody stop!

786
01:06:05,671 --> 01:06:08,132
Don't move an inch!

787
01:06:32,114 --> 01:06:33,908
- Inspector Jo!
- Yes?

788
01:06:35,701 --> 01:06:37,244
Gather them together.

789
01:06:40,247 --> 01:06:41,957
Hey, stop.

790
01:06:42,041 --> 01:06:44,043
Gather together.

791
01:06:44,752 --> 01:06:46,420
Lift up your heads.

792
01:06:47,129 --> 01:06:48,505
Everyone stand in line.

793
01:07:05,439 --> 01:07:07,399
Look in my eyes.

794
01:07:09,693 --> 01:07:11,528
Give me that.

795
01:07:23,999 --> 01:07:26,126
What is it?

796
01:07:29,129 --> 01:07:31,590
- You bastard!
- Out of my way.

797
01:07:32,967 --> 01:07:37,012
You ran away from us?

798
01:07:59,660 --> 01:08:05,165
But... is jerking off a crime?

799
01:08:05,791 --> 01:08:07,084
It's not a crime.

800
01:08:07,793 --> 01:08:09,795
Why'd you run away?

801
01:08:10,254 --> 01:08:13,674
Someone jumped out of the woods
and ran at me,

802
01:08:14,508 --> 01:08:16,218
so I panicked.

803
01:08:16,302 --> 01:08:21,015
Sure, but why'd you go
all the way out there to do it?

804
01:08:21,098 --> 01:08:23,726
There are kids at home,

805
01:08:24,643 --> 01:08:28,063
and the air's nice in the woods.

806
01:08:28,147 --> 01:08:32,568
Or did you go back
to fantasize about the dead girls?

807
01:08:35,195 --> 01:08:41,327
Your husband likes
to go out at night, huh?

808
01:08:42,494 --> 01:08:43,495
What's this?

809
01:08:44,830 --> 01:08:45,831
Gimme that.

810
01:08:50,294 --> 01:08:51,920
What did you make these with?

811
01:09:07,519 --> 01:09:10,189
These days, you know,

812
01:09:10,272 --> 01:09:15,986
real events in our town
are stronger than the magazines.

813
01:09:16,653 --> 01:09:21,658
When I read the newspaper,
I start fantasizing.

814
01:09:21,742 --> 01:09:24,578
I ask myself why I do this,

815
01:09:24,661 --> 01:09:26,955
but when will this chance come again?

816
01:09:30,584 --> 01:09:32,669
According to neighbors,

817
01:09:33,212 --> 01:09:36,131
he looks diligently after his sick wife,

818
01:09:36,215 --> 01:09:38,342
never misses a week at church,

819
01:09:38,425 --> 01:09:40,803
that he's honest.

820
01:09:42,596 --> 01:09:46,392
All perverts are like that.
Nice on the outside.

821
01:09:46,975 --> 01:09:48,894
But my eyes can't be fooled.

822
01:09:50,104 --> 01:09:52,231
One look, and I know.

823
01:09:55,609 --> 01:09:59,405
Honey, I put socks in here.
Change them after dinner.

824
01:09:59,488 --> 01:10:04,493
- Don't forget, or they'll smell.
- I'll take care of it. Go feed the kids.

825
01:10:04,910 --> 01:10:07,830
Watch out for protesters.

826
01:10:08,247 --> 01:10:12,376
Release Jo Byung-soon!

827
01:10:12,793 --> 01:10:16,130
- What now?
- I heard Byung-soon confessed last night.

828
01:10:16,213 --> 01:10:19,425
- Who says so?
- Oh, Chief!

829
01:10:23,595 --> 01:10:25,639
When will you make an announcement?

830
01:10:25,722 --> 01:10:28,851
We know nothing. Just wait a bit more.

831
01:10:28,934 --> 01:10:31,520
You've held him four days
without a warrant.

832
01:10:31,603 --> 01:10:33,897
People are saying he's detained illegally.

833
01:10:34,606 --> 01:10:38,652
This time be realistic, like in a movie.

834
01:10:40,737 --> 01:10:41,738
Go!

835
01:10:42,656 --> 01:10:44,408
You did a good job just now.

836
01:10:44,491 --> 01:10:45,617
Yong-gu?

837
01:10:49,455 --> 01:10:53,375
So, you were hiding behind the outhouse,

838
01:10:53,959 --> 01:10:56,336
and you saw Park Myung-ja

839
01:10:56,420 --> 01:10:59,590
coming towards you
with a flashlight, right?

840
01:10:59,673 --> 01:11:02,759
Yes, yes, yes. It seems so.

841
01:11:04,761 --> 01:11:07,389
Not it seems, you bastard, be precise!

842
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:14,688
I think I dreamed it that way.

843
01:11:15,397 --> 01:11:20,152
Anyway, I snuck up behind her,

844
01:11:20,652 --> 01:11:28,785
and I must have chopped
the back of her neck?

845
01:11:28,869 --> 01:11:31,205
- With my hand like this.
- Next?

846
01:11:32,456 --> 01:11:37,586
Myung-ja cried out,
and I guess she collapsed?

847
01:11:37,669 --> 01:11:43,383
So I laid her on the ground,
and was about to take her...

848
01:11:43,467 --> 01:11:46,929
Hey, it didn't happen there, it was...

849
01:11:50,057 --> 01:11:52,559
The pine grove! I took her there.

850
01:11:52,643 --> 01:11:55,812
It was from the rice paddies
to the pine grove.

851
01:11:55,896 --> 01:11:59,816
According to the news,
more than 200 meters, right?

852
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:01,610
That's so far!

853
01:12:01,693 --> 01:12:05,531
So the rain was pouring,
and I dragged her through the mud.

854
01:12:05,614 --> 01:12:07,533
And then?

855
01:12:08,325 --> 01:12:10,827
So I threw her down in the pine grove.

856
01:12:11,453 --> 01:12:13,956
Then I strangled her.

857
01:12:14,039 --> 01:12:16,458
- With what?
- The bag strap.

858
01:12:16,542 --> 01:12:17,543
Really?

859
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:19,211
Her stocking!

860
01:12:22,339 --> 01:12:23,966
Right.

861
01:12:24,049 --> 01:12:27,219
A brassiere! A Venus brassiere.

862
01:12:27,803 --> 01:12:34,476
I wrapped it around her throat
like this...

863
01:12:35,477 --> 01:12:36,728
so the woman,

864
01:12:37,312 --> 01:12:42,609
she took a rock
and clocked me in the head.

865
01:12:42,693 --> 01:12:43,860
Where'd she hit you?

866
01:12:45,070 --> 01:12:47,573
Right here, next to my eye.

867
01:12:49,950 --> 01:12:54,705
It still hurts,
even if it was just a dream.

868
01:13:05,299 --> 01:13:06,383
Byung-soon?

869
01:13:07,175 --> 01:13:09,595
Are you gonna keep saying it was a dream?

870
01:13:09,678 --> 01:13:13,807
That's enough. Turn your head.

871
01:13:13,890 --> 01:13:16,143
So this bruise is from the rock?

872
01:13:16,226 --> 01:13:18,812
- No, this guy here...
- Shut up! Look here.

873
01:13:23,108 --> 01:13:27,237
You've done well, now let's finish this.

874
01:13:30,073 --> 01:13:35,579
So... since she hit me like this
with the rock,

875
01:13:35,662 --> 01:13:37,539
I must have lost consciousness?

876
01:13:38,206 --> 01:13:43,503
And after lying there a while,
I woke up, and looking around...

877
01:13:43,587 --> 01:13:44,880
And?

878
01:13:44,963 --> 01:13:48,967
I was in the bottom of an outhouse!
A shithouse!

879
01:13:50,052 --> 01:13:54,264
And maggots were creeping
all over the place!

880
01:13:54,348 --> 01:13:58,226
- Not the outhouse again.
- So after brushing them off,

881
01:13:58,310 --> 01:14:02,773
I grabbed some straw,
and pulled myself up.

882
01:14:02,856 --> 01:14:05,692
Even in a dream, it's hard.

883
01:14:05,776 --> 01:14:07,611
But then I saw,

884
01:14:07,694 --> 01:14:12,240
this wasn't someone's home,
it was a school toilet.

885
01:14:13,241 --> 01:14:15,160
Walking to the playground,

886
01:14:15,243 --> 01:14:18,955
I saw huge swarms of girls,

887
01:14:19,039 --> 01:14:21,166
so many, and the smell...

888
01:14:21,249 --> 01:14:23,460
Wait! Over here.

889
01:14:27,422 --> 01:14:30,550
Where did you hear about
that school outhouse?

890
01:14:31,385 --> 01:14:33,970
Everyone knows that story.

891
01:14:34,846 --> 01:14:36,515
I saw it in a dream.

892
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:43,105
From below the gas attack,
run in a direction

893
01:14:43,188 --> 01:14:45,691
perpendicular to the wind.

894
01:14:45,774 --> 01:14:48,193
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.

895
01:14:48,276 --> 01:14:50,487
Put it down. Hey!

896
01:15:00,288 --> 01:15:02,082
Pretend you're dead!

897
01:15:06,336 --> 01:15:10,674
Last time, who told you that story
about the outhouse?

898
01:15:10,757 --> 01:15:12,509
You came because of that?

899
01:15:17,639 --> 01:15:18,807
What's wrong?

900
01:15:18,890 --> 01:15:23,228
I hurt myself in the chute.
There was a pebble in there.

901
01:15:24,646 --> 01:15:26,064
Where's the nurse?

902
01:15:28,233 --> 01:15:29,818
I'll put it on for you.

903
01:15:30,527 --> 01:15:32,028
I'll do it.

904
01:15:33,321 --> 01:15:36,783
Shy? You're just a kid. Sit down.

905
01:15:40,787 --> 01:15:41,955
Give it to me.

906
01:15:44,666 --> 01:15:45,792
Lift up your shirt.

907
01:15:46,918 --> 01:15:50,464
Think about what I asked you.

908
01:15:53,258 --> 01:15:57,471
The murderer in the outhouse,
coming out at night...

909
01:15:58,096 --> 01:16:01,141
Who might have told that story first.

910
01:16:01,850 --> 01:16:03,185
How would I know?

911
01:16:03,268 --> 01:16:08,064
It's like asking who made up
the elephant jokes.

912
01:16:10,275 --> 01:16:13,111
Why don't you go to the outhouse yourself?

913
01:16:13,653 --> 01:16:17,032
Do I look like I have time for that?

914
01:17:07,791 --> 01:17:09,584
Even still,

915
01:17:09,668 --> 01:17:12,671
some kids talk,
so you snoop around the outhouse?

916
01:17:12,754 --> 01:17:14,339
You got that much time?

917
01:17:14,422 --> 01:17:17,175
- Giving me a heart attack.
- Investigating...

918
01:17:17,259 --> 01:17:18,426
What?

919
01:17:19,261 --> 01:17:21,555
Is investigating such a dirty job?

920
01:17:23,598 --> 01:17:27,894
Ah! Is that why they made up the rumor?

921
01:17:29,104 --> 01:17:32,107
I saw her myself once or twice.

922
01:17:32,190 --> 01:17:34,734
- That woman.
- Who?

923
01:17:35,777 --> 01:17:36,945
A crying woman.

924
01:17:38,238 --> 01:17:39,573
When was it?

925
01:17:41,366 --> 01:17:43,451
I was in the outhouse then too,

926
01:17:44,369 --> 01:17:46,580
when I heard a woman crying.

927
01:17:47,455 --> 01:17:49,040
When I came out,

928
01:17:49,958 --> 01:17:55,171
there was a woman working on that hill,
who kept crying.

929
01:17:57,090 --> 01:17:58,717
<i>A woman was crying?</i>

930
01:17:59,593 --> 01:18:00,594
<i>Yes.</i>

931
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:03,722
<i>She kept crying on that hill.</i>

932
01:18:04,806 --> 01:18:06,391
<i>It just seemed strange.</i>

933
01:18:26,703 --> 01:18:27,954
Hello?

934
01:18:30,874 --> 01:18:31,958
Excuse me.

935
01:18:34,294 --> 01:18:36,338
Are you the person who lives here?

936
01:18:38,715 --> 01:18:39,925
Who are you?

937
01:18:41,927 --> 01:18:45,430
I'd like to ask something. I heard that...

938
01:18:48,350 --> 01:18:49,643
Wait!

939
01:18:50,352 --> 01:18:52,020
Look here.

940
01:18:52,103 --> 01:18:54,773
- I'm a policeman.
- Really?

941
01:18:55,649 --> 01:18:59,569
You can't stay there. Someone might see.

942
01:19:01,613 --> 01:19:03,239
There's no one here.

943
01:19:08,119 --> 01:19:10,872
Go, please. I beg you.

944
01:19:22,926 --> 01:19:26,262
Be assured this will remain a secret.

945
01:19:27,847 --> 01:19:29,766
As we're both women...

946
01:19:31,267 --> 01:19:34,187
tell me everything comfortably
and in detail.

947
01:19:39,234 --> 01:19:40,610
That night...

948
01:19:46,282 --> 01:19:48,785
a light rain was falling.

949
01:19:49,619 --> 01:19:50,912
When was it?

950
01:19:53,498 --> 01:19:54,791
It was...

951
01:19:58,962 --> 01:20:00,505
last September.

952
01:20:10,598 --> 01:20:13,018
I had read all the articles...

953
01:20:15,020 --> 01:20:17,188
about the women killed.

954
01:20:20,025 --> 01:20:24,529
The methods he used were exactly the same.

955
01:20:26,364 --> 01:20:27,574
It was...

956
01:20:30,660 --> 01:20:31,828
the same with me.

957
01:20:38,460 --> 01:20:40,003
You saw his face?

958
01:20:40,670 --> 01:20:42,338
I tried not to on purpose...

959
01:20:43,381 --> 01:20:45,091
keeping my chin down.

960
01:20:47,052 --> 01:20:48,845
My panties covered my head...

961
01:20:50,096 --> 01:20:51,848
but I closed my eyes tight.

962
01:20:53,475 --> 01:20:57,062
If I saw him, he'd have killed me.

963
01:21:00,190 --> 01:21:03,860
I don't know about the rest,
but one thing I remember.

964
01:21:05,028 --> 01:21:06,863
His hands were very soft.

965
01:21:08,156 --> 01:21:12,619
The hand over my mouth was delicate,

966
01:21:13,161 --> 01:21:14,287
just like a woman's.

967
01:21:48,321 --> 01:21:51,366
We're done.
Let's get ourselves some sleep.

968
01:21:51,950 --> 01:21:54,702
Once we get your seal, it's done.

969
01:21:56,704 --> 01:21:58,123
It's all as you said.

970
01:21:59,499 --> 01:22:00,625
Sound good?

971
01:22:00,708 --> 01:22:03,837
Yes, of course.

972
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:06,965
Oh, it's finally over, right?

973
01:22:07,048 --> 01:22:09,050
Please let me down. Please.

974
01:22:15,515 --> 01:22:17,684
Let him go. He's not the murderer.

975
01:22:17,767 --> 01:22:18,768
What?

976
01:22:19,936 --> 01:22:22,480
Byung-soon, are you the murderer?

977
01:22:22,564 --> 01:22:24,566
Yes, sir, yes...

978
01:22:24,649 --> 01:22:26,776
Shut up. No, you're not.

979
01:22:26,860 --> 01:22:28,403
I think I am...

980
01:22:28,486 --> 01:22:29,737
Let him go!

981
01:22:31,573 --> 01:22:33,783
Write down everything she said...

982
01:22:33,867 --> 01:22:34,868
Hey!

983
01:22:34,951 --> 01:22:37,162
You toying with me?

984
01:22:37,245 --> 01:22:39,664
Are you having fun?

985
01:22:39,747 --> 01:22:42,625
I caught the murderer, okay?

986
01:22:42,709 --> 01:22:45,003
What do you mean, you caught him?

987
01:22:48,464 --> 01:22:53,052
- Did you hang him from the ceiling?
- Well, he kept lying, and...

988
01:22:53,136 --> 01:22:55,889
Get hold of yourself. Those journalists...

989
01:22:55,972 --> 01:22:59,058
- Chief!
- Those goddamned bastards!

990
01:23:03,313 --> 01:23:05,398
Stop!

991
01:23:07,233 --> 01:23:08,401
Listen.

992
01:23:11,237 --> 01:23:12,238
What is that?

993
01:23:13,907 --> 01:23:16,409
- Is it live?
- It's being broadcast now?

994
01:23:16,492 --> 01:23:17,911
Yes, it's live.

995
01:23:27,253 --> 01:23:30,715
First, declare a state of emergency.

996
01:23:31,132 --> 01:23:34,260
And send me two garrisons of men.

997
01:23:34,844 --> 01:23:37,263
Because our intelligence says so!

998
01:23:38,223 --> 01:23:41,643
Tonight. There'll be a murder tonight.

999
01:23:41,726 --> 01:23:44,520
Hello, I need to speak to producer Im...

1000
01:23:44,604 --> 01:23:46,731
What? He quit?

1001
01:23:47,565 --> 01:23:48,900
Get me the AD now.

1002
01:23:50,151 --> 01:23:53,238
The song that was just played,
"Sad Letter."

1003
01:23:53,321 --> 01:23:55,740
Read the name and address
of the requester.

1004
01:23:56,241 --> 01:23:57,951
You must have the postcard.

1005
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:00,536
What? Prank call?

1006
01:24:01,079 --> 01:24:04,082
It's the police, bastard! Hello?

1007
01:24:04,165 --> 01:24:05,500
I'll go myself.

1008
01:24:06,459 --> 01:24:08,544
Are the garrisons coming?

1009
01:24:08,628 --> 01:24:10,713
They don't even have one man available.

1010
01:24:12,173 --> 01:24:16,344
They went to suppress
a demonstration in Suwon city.

1011
01:24:48,793 --> 01:24:51,629
Name: Ahn Mi-seon, age 28.

1012
01:24:53,589 --> 01:24:59,304
Estimated time of death,
last night between 7:30 and 8:00.

1013
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:06,269
When the two of you were fighting
like madmen. Right?

1014
01:25:09,314 --> 01:25:10,523
Wait a minute.

1015
01:25:12,859 --> 01:25:14,902
There's something in the vagina.

1016
01:25:27,749 --> 01:25:30,126
Looks like a peach.

1017
01:25:57,070 --> 01:25:58,488
Nine pieces.

1018
01:26:05,787 --> 01:26:10,792
Do you see this kind of thing
in Seoul often?

1019
01:26:13,294 --> 01:26:14,295
Never.

1020
01:26:17,924 --> 01:26:19,550
You were right.

1021
01:26:19,967 --> 01:26:21,135
What?

1022
01:26:23,137 --> 01:26:28,393
These guys were a waste of time
from the start.

1023
01:26:30,728 --> 01:26:31,729
Hey!

1024
01:26:33,022 --> 01:26:34,816
A call from the radio station.

1025
01:26:35,233 --> 01:26:38,152
I think she found the postcard.

1026
01:26:40,071 --> 01:26:42,573
I've got the postcard. It has an address.

1027
01:26:43,157 --> 01:26:44,659
Can you write it down?

1028
01:26:45,410 --> 01:26:50,456
Jinan 1-ri, Terung District #32.
Park Hyun-gyu.

1029
01:27:25,283 --> 01:27:26,325
Who are you?

1030
01:27:27,952 --> 01:27:31,372
We're policemen.
Where has Park Hyun-gyu gone?

1031
01:27:33,374 --> 01:27:36,085
He works at the factory at this time.

1032
01:28:01,402 --> 01:28:03,988
Hey, Hyun-gyu. Park Hyun-gyu!

1033
01:28:06,699 --> 01:28:08,117
Park Hyun-gyu!

1034
01:28:37,438 --> 01:28:38,731
Show me your hands.

1035
01:28:48,324 --> 01:28:50,451
They're quite smooth.

1036
01:28:52,828 --> 01:28:55,331
How long have you worked
in the factory office?

1037
01:28:59,085 --> 01:29:00,628
From September last year.

1038
01:29:02,380 --> 01:29:07,009
Then... a little before the first murder.

1039
01:29:11,055 --> 01:29:15,476
So after doing your military service,
you came to this town,

1040
01:29:15,977 --> 01:29:18,729
and the murders all began taking place.

1041
01:29:19,272 --> 01:29:20,273
Right?

1042
01:29:22,233 --> 01:29:23,901
Park Hyun-gyu.

1043
01:29:24,986 --> 01:29:27,029
You sent this postcard to the station.

1044
01:29:27,613 --> 01:29:28,864
Yes.

1045
01:29:28,948 --> 01:29:30,783
You sent several others too.

1046
01:29:30,866 --> 01:29:32,493
Yes.

1047
01:29:33,119 --> 01:29:35,413
You asked it to be played on rainy days.

1048
01:29:36,205 --> 01:29:37,331
Yes.

1049
01:29:39,208 --> 01:29:40,668
"Sad Letter."

1050
01:29:41,794 --> 01:29:45,423
You know that each time this song played,
a woman was murdered?

1051
01:29:48,426 --> 01:29:49,635
No.

1052
01:29:52,138 --> 01:29:54,140
Look at the broadcast records.

1053
01:29:57,226 --> 01:29:58,352
Okay.

1054
01:29:59,812 --> 01:30:02,815
The song played yesterday? "Sad Letter."

1055
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:05,401
Yes.

1056
01:30:05,484 --> 01:30:08,362
- You listened to the program?
- Yes.

1057
01:30:08,446 --> 01:30:12,575
Your song played at 7:08,
and the program finished at 8 p.m.

1058
01:30:12,658 --> 01:30:13,784
- You listened to the end?
- Yes.

1059
01:30:13,868 --> 01:30:15,786
- Continuously?
- Yes.

1060
01:30:15,870 --> 01:30:18,831
- What was the final song?
- I don't know.

1061
01:30:18,914 --> 01:30:20,875
- It was yesterday!
- I don't remember.

1062
01:30:20,958 --> 01:30:23,794
- Because you went out!
- I was home!

1063
01:30:23,878 --> 01:30:27,131
She was killed between 7:30 and 8:00 p.m.

1064
01:30:27,214 --> 01:30:29,759
You weren't listening, you went out!

1065
01:30:29,842 --> 01:30:31,302
Don't make me laugh.

1066
01:30:31,385 --> 01:30:34,597
- Yong-gu!
- You motherfucker. Are you joking?

1067
01:30:34,680 --> 01:30:36,849
- Let go of him now!
- Hey!

1068
01:30:40,686 --> 01:30:41,812
Get back here!

1069
01:30:46,817 --> 01:30:52,281
Even kids in this town
know you torture innocent people.

1070
01:30:52,365 --> 01:30:55,159
- Shut up, you!
- Get back here!

1071
01:30:59,205 --> 01:31:00,956
Anyway, I won't be one of them.

1072
01:31:02,958 --> 01:31:04,377
Never.

1073
01:31:07,380 --> 01:31:09,298
Okay. Park Hyun-gyu.

1074
01:31:09,965 --> 01:31:13,886
You say you listened at home to the end?

1075
01:31:15,012 --> 01:31:18,432
But you couldn't have forgotten
the last song.

1076
01:31:18,974 --> 01:31:24,980
Because the DJ introduced it
with some very striking words.

1077
01:31:25,564 --> 01:31:29,235
She mentioned you,
and the many postcards you sent.

1078
01:31:30,069 --> 01:31:33,698
If you heard it,
you couldn't have forgotten.

1079
01:31:34,490 --> 01:31:37,368
Tell me
if you really listened to the end.

1080
01:31:38,828 --> 01:31:40,413
I don't remember.

1081
01:31:40,830 --> 01:31:42,164
You don't remember?

1082
01:31:43,416 --> 01:31:45,167
Should I explain it for you?

1083
01:31:48,921 --> 01:31:51,465
This is the recording
of yesterday's program.

1084
01:31:53,300 --> 01:31:56,721
Last night,
you sat listening to this song.

1085
01:31:58,139 --> 01:32:02,143
Outside the rain was pelting down,
you listened...

1086
01:32:04,478 --> 01:32:07,148
and soon you started
itching with excitement.

1087
01:32:08,149 --> 01:32:12,153
There's something you always do
when you hear this song.

1088
01:32:13,237 --> 01:32:17,658
You heard a TV program playing
in the room of your landlady,

1089
01:32:18,367 --> 01:32:23,581
you left the lights on in your own room
and crept outside.

1090
01:32:24,373 --> 01:32:29,044
And in the pitch dark,
you wandered here and there.

1091
01:32:30,129 --> 01:32:33,382
Who will it be today?

1092
01:32:34,759 --> 01:32:36,051
Right?

1093
01:32:37,887 --> 01:32:41,474
You hid in a reed field,
waiting for a woman to pass.

1094
01:32:42,183 --> 01:32:43,893
The rain drenching you.

1095
01:32:43,976 --> 01:32:48,189
But you find all this pleasurable.
Stimulating, right?

1096
01:32:48,898 --> 01:32:52,276
So yesterday you stuffed this
in that woman's body!

1097
01:32:54,737 --> 01:32:57,531
You remember how many pieces it was?

1098
01:32:58,699 --> 01:33:00,826
One piece, two,

1099
01:33:01,535 --> 01:33:03,370
- three pieces...
- Shut up!

1100
01:33:03,454 --> 01:33:06,332
Four, five, six, seven, eight...

1101
01:33:06,415 --> 01:33:07,875
Shut the fuck up!

1102
01:33:07,958 --> 01:33:10,336
Yong-gu!

1103
01:33:15,216 --> 01:33:17,134
I told you not to hit him.

1104
01:33:19,678 --> 01:33:21,639
Didn't I?

1105
01:33:22,056 --> 01:33:26,852
I warned you. You know why journalists
snoop around here.

1106
01:33:26,936 --> 01:33:28,646
You stupid bastard.

1107
01:33:31,732 --> 01:33:35,986
Don't even think about coming
into the interrogation room again.

1108
01:33:49,959 --> 01:33:51,752
I'm going crazy.

1109
01:33:55,130 --> 01:33:56,966
No eyewitnesses...

1110
01:33:58,175 --> 01:34:00,052
not one piece of evidence.

1111
01:34:01,720 --> 01:34:04,056
We need something, shit.

1112
01:34:04,849 --> 01:34:08,143
Shit, we don't need any damn witnesses.

1113
01:34:08,769 --> 01:34:10,646
Just a confession will do.

1114
01:34:11,230 --> 01:34:14,358
Just need to beat that bastard
to an inch of his life.

1115
01:34:17,361 --> 01:34:19,071
You've changed.

1116
01:34:21,574 --> 01:34:26,120
Try it and you'll be disgraced.
Like with Kwang-ho.

1117
01:34:30,374 --> 01:34:32,418
Retarded Kwang-ho...

1118
01:34:36,297 --> 01:34:38,841
I always wanted to ask you.

1119
01:34:39,341 --> 01:34:42,219
When you dragged him up the mountain,

1120
01:34:42,303 --> 01:34:48,809
he talked about Hyang-sook's death
in so much detail.

1121
01:34:49,476 --> 01:34:50,769
So?

1122
01:34:50,853 --> 01:34:55,774
Did you really not rehearse
that dialogue with him?

1123
01:34:57,234 --> 01:34:59,028
I told you I didn't!

1124
01:34:59,653 --> 01:35:03,782
But how did he know
the way she was strangled...

1125
01:35:03,866 --> 01:35:05,242
That's my point!

1126
01:35:08,871 --> 01:35:12,041
The tape...
Where's the tape from the mountain?

1127
01:35:12,124 --> 01:35:14,209
Miss Kwon? Gwi-ok.

1128
01:35:14,793 --> 01:35:19,423
<i>Then, Hyang-sook's body shook a bit.</i>

1129
01:35:20,174 --> 01:35:21,675
<i>She looked completely dead.</i>

1130
01:35:21,759 --> 01:35:23,552
Listen to how he speaks here.

1131
01:35:23,636 --> 01:35:27,848
<i>Covered up Hyang-sook's head.</i>

1132
01:35:28,557 --> 01:35:29,642
<i>With what?</i>

1133
01:35:30,059 --> 01:35:31,936
<i>Herpanties.</i>

1134
01:35:32,019 --> 01:35:36,440
<i>Her head was covered with herpanties.</i>

1135
01:35:36,523 --> 01:35:38,525
He's talking like it was someone else.

1136
01:35:38,609 --> 01:35:40,277
<i>And then?</i>

1137
01:35:40,361 --> 01:35:44,365
He's describing what he saw.

1138
01:35:48,619 --> 01:35:50,746
Kwang-ho is the witness.

1139
01:36:02,883 --> 01:36:04,259
Where did Kwang-ho go?

1140
01:36:05,552 --> 01:36:06,804
Kwang-ho...

1141
01:36:07,471 --> 01:36:09,974
No, no. We came for a drink.

1142
01:36:10,432 --> 01:36:12,267
Some meat, please.

1143
01:36:14,228 --> 01:36:16,021
What are you doing here?

1144
01:36:25,072 --> 01:36:27,032
Control yourself, huh?

1145
01:36:27,825 --> 01:36:30,828
He's not in his room. I'll check outside.

1146
01:36:31,495 --> 01:36:33,288
Try the game arcade.

1147
01:36:35,290 --> 01:36:37,084
How long have you been here?

1148
01:36:38,293 --> 01:36:40,004
Have you seen Kwang-ho?

1149
01:36:52,891 --> 01:36:56,353
<i>It is now 23 months
since the incident first surfaced.</i>

1150
01:36:56,437 --> 01:36:59,314
<i>Before interrogating Detective Moon...</i>

1151
01:37:00,024 --> 01:37:02,943
They should cut off all detectives' dicks!

1152
01:37:03,027 --> 01:37:05,195
Nah, it's not worth it.

1153
01:37:05,612 --> 01:37:07,656
Stupid bastards.

1154
01:37:07,740 --> 01:37:10,034
Quiet, let's listen.

1155
01:37:21,086 --> 01:37:24,757
<i>The trial of detective Moon,
suspected of police torture</i>

1156
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:26,592
<i>and sexual assault, opened today.</i>

1157
01:37:47,780 --> 01:37:52,034
You fucked your professor,
didn't you, bitch!

1158
01:37:52,117 --> 01:37:55,162
Your parents pay good money...

1159
01:37:57,790 --> 01:37:59,166
Hey, Yong-gu!

1160
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:07,007
Call the police! Police!

1161
01:38:33,325 --> 01:38:34,618
Kwang-ho!

1162
01:38:35,994 --> 01:38:37,913
Kwang-ho! Don't run away!

1163
01:38:39,123 --> 01:38:40,582
Hey, Kwang-ho!

1164
01:38:41,291 --> 01:38:44,044
Kwang-ho!

1165
01:38:50,926 --> 01:38:52,136
Kwang-ho!

1166
01:38:54,263 --> 01:38:55,514
I'm sorry...

1167
01:38:55,597 --> 01:38:57,891
What's wrong with you?

1168
01:38:57,975 --> 01:39:00,811
We're not here to catch you. Come down.

1169
01:39:02,646 --> 01:39:04,314
You're gonna kill me?

1170
01:39:04,857 --> 01:39:08,318
We'll forget that any of that happened.

1171
01:39:08,402 --> 01:39:11,530
If a fight breaks out, that can happen.

1172
01:39:11,613 --> 01:39:15,075
It's okay, just come down, huh?

1173
01:39:15,159 --> 01:39:18,745
If I do, you'll kill me? I know it.

1174
01:39:18,829 --> 01:39:21,081
We won't kill you, just come down.

1175
01:39:21,165 --> 01:39:25,252
Okay, just stay there for now.
We've something to ask you.

1176
01:39:26,086 --> 01:39:28,088
You...

1177
01:39:28,172 --> 01:39:31,133
You remember Hyang-sook?

1178
01:39:32,467 --> 01:39:34,386
Hyang-sook is pretty.

1179
01:39:35,804 --> 01:39:39,141
That's right.
You used to follow after her.

1180
01:39:39,224 --> 01:39:41,935
But that night,

1181
01:39:42,019 --> 01:39:46,690
when it rained, you saw her killed, huh?

1182
01:39:46,773 --> 01:39:49,526
That? I told you already.

1183
01:39:49,610 --> 01:39:53,739
In the forest. I told you already...

1184
01:39:53,822 --> 01:39:57,868
You saw when Hyang-sook was murdered,
didn't you? Here?

1185
01:39:57,951 --> 01:40:00,120
Yeah, here.

1186
01:40:01,121 --> 01:40:03,916
The paddy next to the train tracks.

1187
01:40:07,419 --> 01:40:11,715
That night, did you see the killer's face?

1188
01:40:12,341 --> 01:40:14,801
- Yeah.
- Really?

1189
01:40:15,510 --> 01:40:17,054
Lightning, ka-rang!

1190
01:40:20,432 --> 01:40:23,810
I saw everything from inside here.

1191
01:40:25,312 --> 01:40:28,023
So you saw his face?

1192
01:40:28,106 --> 01:40:29,816
Three times.

1193
01:40:31,276 --> 01:40:33,737
Do you remember him in detail?

1194
01:40:34,947 --> 01:40:36,240
He was handsome.

1195
01:40:37,407 --> 01:40:39,451
More than me.

1196
01:40:44,873 --> 01:40:47,417
Was this the face you saw?

1197
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:51,255
Look at the picture.

1198
01:41:01,265 --> 01:41:05,435
- You know how hot that fire was?
- Look at the photo!

1199
01:41:06,353 --> 01:41:09,982
- It was so hot!
- Snap out of it!

1200
01:41:10,983 --> 01:41:13,277
Here, look closely.

1201
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:16,029
Hot, hot, hot, hot!

1202
01:41:16,113 --> 01:41:18,198
Look at the photo!

1203
01:41:18,282 --> 01:41:19,992
Hey. Kwang-ho.

1204
01:41:20,075 --> 01:41:25,580
When I was young, he threw me in the fire.
That man.

1205
01:41:25,664 --> 01:41:27,708
- Kwang-ho!
- You bastards!

1206
01:41:27,791 --> 01:41:29,459
What the hell!

1207
01:41:31,378 --> 01:41:33,088
Please forgive him.

1208
01:41:33,547 --> 01:41:34,965
You bastard!

1209
01:41:35,048 --> 01:41:37,634
What are you students doing?

1210
01:41:38,510 --> 01:41:40,178
We're police!

1211
01:41:40,262 --> 01:41:42,472
Bullshit! Then we're the FBI!

1212
01:41:57,529 --> 01:42:01,491
Hey, Kwang-ho! We're looking for you.

1213
01:42:02,993 --> 01:42:04,036
Hey!

1214
01:42:04,494 --> 01:42:07,039
A train's coming! Come here!

1215
01:42:13,003 --> 01:42:14,629
Out of the way, quick!

1216
01:42:16,715 --> 01:42:17,716
It's dangerous there.

1217
01:42:18,216 --> 01:42:20,510
Out of the way! You idiot!

1218
01:42:20,594 --> 01:42:22,220
Stay away. Go...

1219
01:43:03,136 --> 01:43:06,598
It's okay for you to be here?
They'll be looking for you.

1220
01:43:42,592 --> 01:43:44,344
Yes, yes.

1221
01:43:44,428 --> 01:43:48,348
Journalists tend to be like that.

1222
01:43:48,432 --> 01:43:51,935
Sir, as I said last time...

1223
01:43:52,436 --> 01:43:55,605
Hello? Hello?

1224
01:43:56,022 --> 01:43:58,150
Assholes!

1225
01:43:58,233 --> 01:44:00,485
High-ranking bastards...

1226
01:44:00,944 --> 01:44:02,863
- Chief!
- What?

1227
01:44:03,280 --> 01:44:06,825
It's Investigative Crimes.
They found semen.

1228
01:44:07,284 --> 01:44:08,285
They found what?

1229
01:44:08,368 --> 01:44:09,703
Take a look.

1230
01:44:09,786 --> 01:44:12,873
The semen was found
on the victim's clothing.

1231
01:44:12,956 --> 01:44:17,294
Maybe he masturbated on the corpse,

1232
01:44:17,377 --> 01:44:19,713
and semen fell on her clothes.

1233
01:44:19,796 --> 01:44:22,090
Wait. So...

1234
01:44:22,757 --> 01:44:25,844
if the DNA in this semen

1235
01:44:25,927 --> 01:44:28,763
is confirmed to match
that of Park Hyun-gyu,

1236
01:44:28,847 --> 01:44:34,978
then the game's over, isn't it?

1237
01:44:35,061 --> 01:44:38,273
Yes, that would be quite strong evidence.

1238
01:44:38,732 --> 01:44:43,320
The problem is,
we don't have the technology in Korea

1239
01:44:43,403 --> 01:44:45,238
to carry out such tests.

1240
01:44:45,989 --> 01:44:49,993
It must be sent to America.
There's no other way.

1241
01:44:51,495 --> 01:44:54,998
Once the test's complete,
the results will be released.

1242
01:44:55,081 --> 01:44:58,793
So we just have to wait
for the documents from America?

1243
01:44:58,877 --> 01:45:00,045
That's right.

1244
01:45:01,254 --> 01:45:04,382
You sent people
to watch over Park Hyun-gyu?

1245
01:45:04,466 --> 01:45:08,345
Yes! They're watching him 24-hours a day.

1246
01:45:09,262 --> 01:45:11,556
Once the result comes in from America,

1247
01:45:11,640 --> 01:45:14,976
wait until we get our hands
on that bastard.

1248
01:45:32,244 --> 01:45:35,872
- What's wrong with your leg?
- Why?

1249
01:45:36,456 --> 01:45:39,668
- Did you go to the hospital?
- For this little scratch?

1250
01:45:39,751 --> 01:45:43,380
- Come here.
- It's okay. I put on some medicine.

1251
01:45:44,756 --> 01:45:46,925
- What is that?
- Oh, that night...

1252
01:45:49,678 --> 01:45:52,973
- It keeps swelling.
- Come on, let's go.

1253
01:45:53,056 --> 01:45:54,307
Just get in.

1254
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:58,645
So, you have to amputate?

1255
01:45:59,145 --> 01:46:00,981
Should I explain it again?

1256
01:46:01,064 --> 01:46:04,401
It was pierced,
but why cut off a healthy leg?

1257
01:46:04,484 --> 01:46:06,570
If you don't, he'll die.

1258
01:46:07,737 --> 01:46:10,657
Tetanus is a brutal thing.

1259
01:46:11,491 --> 01:46:14,494
For rusty nails,
you need to see a doctor fast.

1260
01:46:14,578 --> 01:46:16,997
Bunch of dim-witted boneheads.

1261
01:46:17,789 --> 01:46:22,210
Be grateful it's under the knee.

1262
01:46:23,795 --> 01:46:25,171
Crazy bastards.

1263
01:46:25,255 --> 01:46:26,298
Let's go.

1264
01:46:29,718 --> 01:46:30,719
Are you family?

1265
01:46:30,802 --> 01:46:33,013
He doesn't have any,
but I'm like his brother...

1266
01:46:33,096 --> 01:46:35,348
Anyway, you came together, right?

1267
01:46:35,432 --> 01:46:39,644
The authorization for surgery.
Read it, then sign.

1268
01:46:57,078 --> 01:46:58,788
You fucker...

1269
01:47:14,387 --> 01:47:15,639
Hello, post office?

1270
01:47:16,681 --> 01:47:18,933
It's Seo Tae-yoon, Investigative Crimes.

1271
01:47:19,893 --> 01:47:22,687
Have the documents from America arrived?

1272
01:47:24,981 --> 01:47:26,900
Have you checked 100%?

1273
01:47:28,526 --> 01:47:31,112
I keep calling because it's important!

1274
01:47:32,113 --> 01:47:36,493
Since it's so important,
please call as soon as it comes.

1275
01:47:40,664 --> 01:47:41,831
Hello?

1276
01:47:44,876 --> 01:47:46,795
Uh, now?

1277
01:47:48,046 --> 01:47:49,589
Why'd you call me out?

1278
01:47:50,340 --> 01:47:53,093
Why? Can't I do that sometimes?

1279
01:47:53,593 --> 01:47:57,389
Your face looks worn.
Are you sleeping well?

1280
01:47:59,766 --> 01:48:01,768
What kind of detective sleeps well?

1281
01:48:04,145 --> 01:48:07,982
- What's wrong with you?
- Fishing? Damn free-riders.

1282
01:48:12,654 --> 01:48:14,447
Why'd you call out a busy man?

1283
01:48:19,244 --> 01:48:21,496
You look like a corpse.

1284
01:48:25,041 --> 01:48:29,671
It may be no use asking,
but can you do anything else?

1285
01:48:31,923 --> 01:48:33,550
Can you quit your job?

1286
01:49:55,089 --> 01:49:57,884
Violent Crimes Dept! Violent Crimes!

1287
01:49:58,468 --> 01:50:01,012
How many visits in one night?

1288
01:50:01,095 --> 01:50:03,431
Is money that important?

1289
01:50:05,642 --> 01:50:09,312
Bo-kyung's grandmother collapsed again.
I have to go.

1290
01:50:09,395 --> 01:50:12,774
You deserve a medal.

1291
01:50:12,857 --> 01:50:14,984
Get one from the Health Ministry.

1292
01:50:25,119 --> 01:50:28,748
Chief! Park Hyun-gyu
hasn't come home for two hours.

1293
01:50:28,832 --> 01:50:32,001
It's only six stops from there
to his house,

1294
01:50:32,418 --> 01:50:34,254
so he must have gotten off.

1295
01:50:34,337 --> 01:50:37,131
Would a man under investigation
act so wild?

1296
01:50:37,215 --> 01:50:39,884
He's capable of it.

1297
01:50:40,301 --> 01:50:44,472
- He's instinctively crazy.
- You seem like the crazy one!

1298
01:50:44,556 --> 01:50:50,353
Once the DNA tests arrive, he's through.
Stop it.

1299
01:50:51,020 --> 01:50:52,939
I let him go...

1300
01:50:53,731 --> 01:50:56,150
Don't get so upset!

1301
01:52:37,627 --> 01:52:44,592
<i>Citizens, this is a civil defense drill.</i>

1302
01:52:44,676 --> 01:52:49,722
<i>A blackout is called for
in all buildings and houses...</i>

1303
01:54:00,960 --> 01:54:05,131
Will you make any special investigation
into this incident?

1304
01:54:20,563 --> 01:54:22,857
A razor wound in the breast...

1305
01:54:25,985 --> 01:54:27,445
What the hell?

1306
01:54:29,072 --> 01:54:31,574
Something is stuck inside of the vagina.

1307
01:54:32,950 --> 01:54:36,162
Huh? Looks like a ball point pen,

1308
01:54:36,788 --> 01:54:38,498
and a spoon.

1309
01:54:38,581 --> 01:54:40,708
Jesus...

1310
01:54:44,170 --> 01:54:46,380
Look inside, closely.

1311
01:54:52,929 --> 01:54:54,972
Wait, what's that?

1312
01:54:57,100 --> 01:54:59,268
An old band-aid.

1313
01:55:13,032 --> 01:55:14,784
What are you doing?

1314
01:55:17,286 --> 01:55:19,539
Why are you touching a corpse?

1315
01:55:45,064 --> 01:55:46,065
What?

1316
01:55:49,485 --> 01:55:50,945
Get up, you bastard!

1317
01:55:58,244 --> 01:56:00,538
You fucker!

1318
01:56:03,958 --> 01:56:06,210
Get up, you fucker.

1319
01:56:08,379 --> 01:56:11,090
Are you human?

1320
01:56:24,437 --> 01:56:28,232
Nobody will care if I kill you.

1321
01:56:38,618 --> 01:56:40,161
Tell me!

1322
01:56:41,495 --> 01:56:43,289
Tell me you killed them!

1323
01:56:45,791 --> 01:56:47,627
Tell me!

1324
01:56:47,710 --> 01:56:50,504
You killed all those women!

1325
01:57:10,608 --> 01:57:11,692
Yeah.

1326
01:57:12,526 --> 01:57:13,819
I killed them.

1327
01:57:16,155 --> 01:57:17,865
I killed them all.

1328
01:57:22,078 --> 01:57:26,165
That's what you want to hear, right?

1329
01:57:27,833 --> 01:57:29,293
You feel better?

1330
01:57:34,757 --> 01:57:36,842
Inspector Seo!

1331
01:57:38,427 --> 01:57:40,179
The papers from America!

1332
01:57:41,264 --> 01:57:42,556
Read them!

1333
01:57:43,849 --> 01:57:45,101
Shit!

1334
01:57:45,184 --> 01:57:46,352
You fucker!

1335
01:57:48,271 --> 01:57:50,564
You fucker! You mocked us, didn't you?

1336
01:57:50,648 --> 01:57:52,566
You bastard!

1337
01:57:54,902 --> 01:57:56,320
You mocked us!

1338
01:58:13,838 --> 01:58:14,880
What's wrong?

1339
01:58:47,163 --> 01:58:48,622
There's a mistake.

1340
01:58:59,550 --> 01:59:02,178
This document is a lie. I don't need it.

1341
01:59:15,941 --> 01:59:18,069
What does it say, huh?

1342
01:59:26,660 --> 01:59:28,954
It really wasn't you?

1343
01:59:36,420 --> 01:59:37,797
Look in my eyes.

1344
02:00:09,286 --> 02:00:10,704
Look in my eyes!

1345
02:00:25,428 --> 02:00:27,012
Fuck, I don't know.

1346
02:00:34,728 --> 02:00:36,439
Do you get up each morning too?

1347
02:00:40,818 --> 02:00:41,819
Go!

1348
02:00:44,989 --> 02:00:46,532
Just go, fucker!

1349
02:02:01,941 --> 02:02:03,317
That's enough.

1350
02:02:38,227 --> 02:02:43,774
2003

1351
02:02:43,857 --> 02:02:45,276
Chi-hyuk.

1352
02:02:46,485 --> 02:02:51,073
You played computer games
all night, right?

1353
02:02:52,074 --> 02:02:53,284
Did you or didn't you?

1354
02:02:57,997 --> 02:02:59,623
Look in my eyes, son.

1355
02:03:00,708 --> 02:03:02,251
Eyes all bloodshot.

1356
02:03:03,586 --> 02:03:06,088
- Do you play well?
- Yeah!

1357
02:03:06,505 --> 02:03:09,425
You don't study,
might as well be good at games.

1358
02:03:10,676 --> 02:03:15,014
If you won't study, go get some exercise.

1359
02:03:15,097 --> 02:03:17,558
Sitting in front of the computer...

1360
02:03:17,975 --> 02:03:19,560
I really didn't!

1361
02:03:19,643 --> 02:03:21,145
What do you mean you didn't?

1362
02:03:21,645 --> 02:03:23,689
Think you can fool my eyes?

1363
02:03:25,107 --> 02:03:27,735
He said he didn't. Believe him.

1364
02:03:27,818 --> 02:03:32,906
No, two days ago,
Manager Oh called my company.

1365
02:03:34,283 --> 02:03:38,954
He kept saying you can't do this
to people, it's not fair.

1366
02:03:39,038 --> 02:03:42,124
You can't believe him.

1367
02:03:43,083 --> 02:03:45,002
Did I do anything wrong?

1368
02:03:46,337 --> 02:03:50,424
Oh, Chairman Kim...
I'm on the road now with our product.

1369
02:03:53,927 --> 02:03:56,639
Sure, let's have dinner with Manager Oh.

1370
02:03:58,182 --> 02:03:59,642
It's been a while.

1371
02:04:03,145 --> 02:04:06,065
Chul-Yong! Pull over a minute!

1372
02:05:43,954 --> 02:05:45,581
Is something in there?

1373
02:05:47,458 --> 02:05:49,001
Is anything in there?

1374
02:05:50,335 --> 02:05:51,754
No...

1375
02:05:52,880 --> 02:05:54,548
Then why are you looking?

1376
02:05:57,009 --> 02:05:58,677
I'm just looking.

1377
02:05:59,762 --> 02:06:01,138
That's so weird.

1378
02:06:03,390 --> 02:06:04,683
What is?

1379
02:06:06,143 --> 02:06:07,895
A while back,

1380
02:06:07,978 --> 02:06:12,024
a man was here looking into that hole.

1381
02:06:15,944 --> 02:06:18,614
I asked him the same question.

1382
02:06:19,323 --> 02:06:21,116
Why he was looking there.

1383
02:06:21,617 --> 02:06:22,826
What did he say?

1384
02:06:23,744 --> 02:06:25,245
What was it?

1385
02:06:26,205 --> 02:06:27,664
Right...

1386
02:06:27,748 --> 02:06:31,502
He remembered
doing something here long ago,

1387
02:06:32,002 --> 02:06:35,839
so he came back to take a look.

1388
02:06:49,520 --> 02:06:51,438
Did you see his face?

1389
02:06:56,819 --> 02:06:58,320
What did he look like?

1390
02:07:00,113 --> 02:07:01,323
Well...

1391
02:07:03,325 --> 02:07:04,868
kind of plain.

1392
02:07:07,120 --> 02:07:08,372
In what way?

1393
02:07:11,416 --> 02:07:12,626
Just...

1394
02:07:15,003 --> 02:07:16,213
ordinary.
