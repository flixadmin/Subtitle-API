00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:05,554
When I say I made you,
you gotta say you made me.

329
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,710
How childish can you get?

330
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:10,878
You wouldn't hit a guy with glasses on,
would you?

What are you laughing at?

334
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:36,831
Here, let me lend you a hand.

They don't make them like they used to!

338
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:00,913
Hey, Batsy!

339
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:16,713
There he is! Down there! Go down!

340
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:30,553
It's time to retire.

341
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:34,350
Feel free to drop in.

342
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:45,800
Sometimes I just kill myself!

343
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:50,799
Come on.

344
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,029
Hold on!

Aren't you covering this press conference?

No.

352
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:13,951
What about our Pulitzer Prize?

353
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:15,953
What about us?

354
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:18,876
What about your picture of Batman?

355
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:28,513
Take care, Allie.

Question. How do we call him?

He gave us a signal.

Hi, Alfred.

Mr. Wayne told me to tell you...
