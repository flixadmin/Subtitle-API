1
00:01:03,026 --> 00:01:04,069
Hey, Jimenez.

2
00:01:04,194 --> 00:01:07,239
Do you think
the Special Forces guys killed him?

3
00:01:07,364 --> 00:01:09,324
If he can even be killed, that is.

4
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,999
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?

5
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:19,251
I don't know.

6
00:01:19,376 --> 00:01:21,837
But I heard they shot him 20 times.

7
00:01:22,504 --> 00:01:24,673
They pumped him full of lead first.

8
00:01:24,798 --> 00:01:28,135
Then they burned his body
and spread his ashes all over Medellin.

9
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:34,016
And they say that
he rose from the ashes,

10
00:01:34,141 --> 00:01:37,227
and he went to the houses
of each of the men who had shot him,

11
00:01:37,352 --> 00:01:39,229
and he killed them as they slept.

12
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,481
Bullshit.

13
00:01:41,607 --> 00:01:43,483
Quiet! Someone's coming.

14
00:01:44,776 --> 00:01:46,903
<i>We're soldiers from the National Army!</i>

15
00:01:47,029 --> 00:01:49,281
<i>Stop and identify yourselves!</i>

16
00:01:50,032 --> 00:01:51,700
<i>We're well armed!</i>

17
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:09,551
Mr Escobar.

18
00:02:10,385 --> 00:02:13,347
I'm sorry, but we've been ordered
to not let you through.

19
00:02:13,472 --> 00:02:15,849
We have to take you into custody again.

20
00:02:26,068 --> 00:02:27,944
I'm sorry, son...

21
00:02:30,072 --> 00:02:33,200
But unfortunately,
I can't allow that to happen.

22
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:43,543
If you'll excuse me.

23
00:02:57,474 --> 00:03:00,185
Not a word of this to anyone,
understood?

24
00:06:32,689 --> 00:06:34,441
This...

25
00:06:34,566 --> 00:06:36,902
is an embarrassment for Colombia,
gentlemen.

26
00:06:40,363 --> 00:06:41,489
So...

27
00:06:43,033 --> 00:06:45,410
- How will we proceed?
- Mr President...

28
00:06:48,413 --> 00:06:53,752
Escobar will surely attempt
to re-establish himself within the city,

29
00:06:53,877 --> 00:06:57,422
and we can't allow him or his <i>sicarios</i>
to move freely.

30
00:06:57,547 --> 00:07:01,009
So my recommendation, Mr President,
is that we occupy Medellin.

31
00:07:01,134 --> 00:07:04,763
Flood the streets with officers.
Conduct searches.

32
00:07:04,888 --> 00:07:08,516
Close down the streets.
Establish vehicle checkpoints.

33
00:07:08,642 --> 00:07:10,352
Pressure him until he appears.

34
00:07:10,477 --> 00:07:12,479
And who would conduct
such an operation?

35
00:07:12,604 --> 00:07:14,648
Colonel Pinzón, sir.

36
00:07:17,192 --> 00:07:19,653
- He should begin immediately.
- Of course, sir.

37
00:07:23,156 --> 00:07:26,534
<i>- Are you injured?</i>
- No, I'm OK. I'm not hurt.

38
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,620
<i>You know I couldn't talk to him.</i>

39
00:07:28,995 --> 00:07:30,705
I couldn't negotiate with Escobar.

40
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:35,585
- I understand.
- Why did you go inside?

41
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:37,712
<i>I don't know.
I sensed something was off.</i>

42
00:07:37,837 --> 00:07:41,591
<i>Ariza said his orders were only
to secure the perimeter.</i>

43
00:07:41,716 --> 00:07:43,927
<i>Well, he lied. I gave the order myself.</i>

44
00:07:44,719 --> 00:07:47,597
<i>Go home and get some rest,
but come back soon.</i>

45
00:07:47,722 --> 00:07:50,934
You know you're the only person
I can trust.

46
00:07:51,935 --> 00:07:53,144
Yes, sir.

47
00:08:01,444 --> 00:08:04,781
It's all right, Tata. I'll be right back.
Excuse me, Doña Hermilda.

48
00:08:07,867 --> 00:08:08,994
Boss.

49
00:08:10,787 --> 00:08:13,039
- Good to see you.
- It's great to have you back.

50
00:08:13,164 --> 00:08:14,708
Very good to see you.

51
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,918
He's here. It's him.

52
00:08:17,043 --> 00:08:20,797
- Praise the Lord. I knew it. I knew it!
- How are you, brother?

53
00:08:22,215 --> 00:08:23,550
Pablo!

54
00:08:28,138 --> 00:08:30,056
Thank God.

55
00:08:31,808 --> 00:08:33,560
- Oh, my son!
- How are you?

56
00:08:33,685 --> 00:08:34,936
- I'm fine.
- You're OK?

57
00:08:35,061 --> 00:08:36,396
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

58
00:08:36,521 --> 00:08:38,106
- You're all right?
- I am.

59
00:08:45,572 --> 00:08:48,450
- I did everything I could, Dad.
- I know.

60
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,744
I know.

61
00:08:50,869 --> 00:08:52,829
I'm very proud.

62
00:08:54,205 --> 00:08:55,915
I love you very much.

63
00:09:05,967 --> 00:09:07,177
It's Dad.

64
00:09:10,513 --> 00:09:14,601
...you and your family. May he always
protect you in his holy glory.

65
00:09:14,726 --> 00:09:16,186
Thank you very much.

66
00:09:16,311 --> 00:09:18,354
You're great boys.

67
00:09:23,568 --> 00:09:27,030
- Monitor the police frequencies.
- Yes.

68
00:09:27,155 --> 00:09:30,325
And don't bother me
unless it's necessary.

69
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,077
As you wish, boss.

70
00:09:33,036 --> 00:09:34,746
Very good.

71
00:09:36,873 --> 00:09:38,458
Very good, gentlemen.

72
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,710
Very good.

73
00:09:52,055 --> 00:09:54,766
Please take the things out of the car,
put them over there.

74
00:10:10,073 --> 00:10:11,658
I felt I'd lost you.

75
00:10:13,535 --> 00:10:15,662
You're never going to lose me.

76
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,959
And what now, Pablo?

77
00:10:21,084 --> 00:10:22,877
What will we do now?

78
00:10:24,003 --> 00:10:28,675
I did what I had to do, Tata.

79
00:10:30,802 --> 00:10:32,846
I'll take care of it.

80
00:10:34,681 --> 00:10:39,144
We'll be fine, and content,

81
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:43,189
and happy, and together, and united.

82
00:10:43,314 --> 00:10:44,524
But...

83
00:10:45,608 --> 00:10:46,943
Always.

84
00:10:56,703 --> 00:10:58,121
Always.

85
00:10:59,789 --> 00:11:02,709
- Tell me you'll never leave me.
- Never.

86
00:11:04,627 --> 00:11:06,045
Promise me.

87
00:11:09,507 --> 00:11:11,134
I promise.

88
00:11:13,887 --> 00:11:16,097
I promise, my love.

89
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:26,042
I understand, you're from the DEA,
but I have to ask Colonel Pinzón first.

90
00:12:26,167 --> 00:12:27,210
Wait one moment.

91
00:12:38,638 --> 00:12:41,349
Gentlemen, wait here for a moment.

92
00:12:41,474 --> 00:12:44,477
We'll let you in once the area
is secured, understood?

93
00:12:47,772 --> 00:12:50,441
We're going to have to move everything.

94
00:12:51,276 --> 00:12:54,570
- What do you mean by "everything"?
- Everything. The labs...

95
00:12:55,488 --> 00:13:01,744
the offices, the hideouts, the deposits...
we're moving everything.

96
00:13:01,869 --> 00:13:03,871
Boss, even the labs?

97
00:13:04,706 --> 00:13:06,791
They're well-guarded.
There's no problem.

98
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:11,045
Come on, don't you know
what's going on at La Catedral?

99
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:15,717
The cops are going through the maps
and documents you idiots left behind.

100
00:13:15,842 --> 00:13:17,927
Now we can't trust anyone,
you bastards.

101
00:13:18,052 --> 00:13:19,929
Who are you calling a bastard?

102
00:13:20,054 --> 00:13:24,017
We are. Moving. Everything.

103
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:27,437
- Right?
- Yes, sir.

104
00:13:27,562 --> 00:13:29,147
Yes, Don Pablo.

105
00:13:29,272 --> 00:13:31,649
We're also going to need more men.

106
00:13:32,608 --> 00:13:35,069
Last night we lost a lot of brothers.

107
00:13:36,404 --> 00:13:39,198
- May they rest in peace.
- Amen.

108
00:13:43,494 --> 00:13:44,787
And one last thing.

109
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:50,001
I'm going to need a good driver with a
clean record to drive me around the city.

110
00:13:50,126 --> 00:13:55,840
He needs to be smart,
fearless and determined.

111
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:59,802
- Done, boss.
- Boss, I'm sorry, but...

112
00:14:00,928 --> 00:14:02,638
You can't risk yourself like that.

113
00:14:02,764 --> 00:14:05,224
Yes, Don Pablo, I agree with Velasco.

114
00:14:06,225 --> 00:14:10,772
I want people to know that
Pablo Escobar doesn't hide like a rat.

115
00:14:14,108 --> 00:14:15,860
Because we...

116
00:14:17,028 --> 00:14:21,449
are the Medellin cartel, motherfucker!

117
00:14:58,986 --> 00:15:00,029
Pablo, no!

118
00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:07,245
You believe whatever the fuck
you want, you son of a bitch!

119
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:19,817
- This again? Stop obsessing. Relax.
- Relax? What do you want me to do?

120
00:16:19,942 --> 00:16:22,945
To sit here and wait for Pablo
to walk through that door

121
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:26,157
and kill me and my daughter?
He's going to come and kill you, too.

122
00:16:26,282 --> 00:16:28,743
- How about that?
- Pablo won't be killing anyone.

123
00:16:28,868 --> 00:16:30,828
Jaime, what country do you live in?

124
00:16:31,954 --> 00:16:34,790
If he hasn't killed anyone yet,
he's planning on it.

125
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:40,254
Haven't you noticed, Berna?
Judy, haven't you noticed?

126
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:42,882
Gaviria's got this city
swarming with cops.

127
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:45,927
There's a cop
on every fucking corner.

128
00:16:46,802 --> 00:16:48,930
Pablo can't move.

129
00:16:49,055 --> 00:16:52,934
Then we have to find and kill
the bastard before the police finds him.

130
00:16:53,059 --> 00:16:54,560
Judy, listen.

131
00:16:55,645 --> 00:16:57,605
Listen to me! Listen!

132
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:02,109
Pablo, right now, is like a caged rat.
Understand?

133
00:17:02,235 --> 00:17:03,778
Jaime.

134
00:17:04,862 --> 00:17:08,407
Despite everything, you still don't know
what Pablo's like?

135
00:17:08,533 --> 00:17:12,411
- He's someone we can't underestimate.
- You said it, Berna.

136
00:17:12,537 --> 00:17:15,289
They shouldn't underestimate us either.

137
00:17:15,414 --> 00:17:17,667
Pablo's running out of allies,
and you know it.

138
00:17:17,792 --> 00:17:20,378
Pablo will always have allies.

139
00:17:20,503 --> 00:17:24,840
Berna, I want everyone to know
what happened to Kiko.

140
00:17:26,175 --> 00:17:31,264
It should be crystal clear
that being loyal to Pablo

141
00:17:31,389 --> 00:17:33,516
will only earn you a bullet in the head.

142
00:17:33,641 --> 00:17:37,812
They'll know what side
they should be on, right?

143
00:17:37,937 --> 00:17:39,230
Judy...

144
00:17:41,482 --> 00:17:43,484
what shall we do with the labs?

145
00:17:46,445 --> 00:17:47,905
What do you suggest?

146
00:17:50,241 --> 00:17:53,703
I think we shut down the labs,
at least for a while.

147
00:17:55,288 --> 00:18:00,001
We have to lay low
until Pablo is killed or captured.

148
00:18:00,126 --> 00:18:04,297
That's bullshit, Berna.
Tell me how that makes any sense.

149
00:18:04,422 --> 00:18:08,092
A lot of other people stopped
paying Pablo at the same time as us.

150
00:18:08,217 --> 00:18:10,261
Let's join forces with them.

151
00:18:10,386 --> 00:18:13,556
There's the Priscos, for example.
Last night I met with Ricardo.

152
00:18:13,681 --> 00:18:15,057
I'll talk to him.

153
00:18:15,182 --> 00:18:18,227
Jaime, be very careful
with those people.

154
00:18:23,774 --> 00:18:25,109
- Hello?
- OK?

155
00:18:25,234 --> 00:18:27,111
- Nice.
- One moment.

156
00:18:27,236 --> 00:18:28,446
Ricardo?

157
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,784
Don Pablo.

158
00:18:38,122 --> 00:18:40,750
Of course there was
no decision to make.

159
00:18:41,584 --> 00:18:43,878
You know that
you can always count on us.

160
00:18:55,389 --> 00:18:56,724
Sweetie!

161
00:19:00,811 --> 00:19:01,854
Fag!

162
00:19:01,979 --> 00:19:04,440
How's it going, Limóm?

163
00:19:04,565 --> 00:19:07,693
- Son of a bitch.
- How's it going, brother? Good or what?

164
00:19:07,818 --> 00:19:12,698
Quica, my love, come give me
the best 20 minutes of my life.

165
00:19:12,823 --> 00:19:14,784
What are you doing here?
Are you going in?

166
00:19:14,909 --> 00:19:16,994
No, brother.
I didn't come to see the whores.

167
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:20,831
- Then what?
- I came to see you, brother.

168
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:26,504
And from what I can see,
you're still driving whores everywhere.

169
00:19:26,629 --> 00:19:28,547
You know. I have to pay rent.

170
00:19:29,382 --> 00:19:33,386
Listen, Limón,
why don't you make good money?

171
00:19:34,345 --> 00:19:35,721
Doing what?

172
00:19:36,514 --> 00:19:39,892
- The same thing, brother.
- Driving who?

173
00:19:41,018 --> 00:19:42,770
Pablo Escobar, brother.

174
00:19:42,895 --> 00:19:46,440
- Eat shit, you bastard.
- Limón, I'm serious.

175
00:19:46,565 --> 00:19:47,858
Come here.

176
00:19:47,983 --> 00:19:52,029
The boss asked us to find someone...

177
00:19:52,571 --> 00:19:55,449
you know, someone clean,
who the police don't know.

178
00:19:56,492 --> 00:19:58,202
He would go in the trunk.

179
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:04,625
- Where would I have to take him?
- Wherever he says. You don't ask.

180
00:20:06,711 --> 00:20:08,462
What do you think, brother?

181
00:20:11,716 --> 00:20:13,008
There's cops everywhere.

182
00:20:13,134 --> 00:20:16,053
Why don't we put a girl in the back
so no one gets suspicious?

183
00:20:18,723 --> 00:20:21,934
- Which one of the whores do you trust?
- They're whores.

184
00:20:22,059 --> 00:20:24,478
Then who, brother?

185
00:20:25,146 --> 00:20:27,022
- No!
- No?

186
00:20:28,441 --> 00:20:29,650
- Thanks.
- Why not?

187
00:20:29,775 --> 00:20:31,986
- No.
- What's wrong with it? Nothing.

188
00:20:32,111 --> 00:20:35,448
- I'm very busy, Jhon.
- That doesn't matter, Maritza.

189
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,324
Yes?

190
00:20:38,826 --> 00:20:40,953
Ask one of the girls
you drive around all day.

191
00:20:41,078 --> 00:20:42,663
- I can't.
- Move.

192
00:20:42,788 --> 00:20:46,542
Maritza... I need you to do it.

193
00:20:46,667 --> 00:20:49,587
It'll be the easiest money
you've ever made.

194
00:20:49,712 --> 00:20:52,465
You'll be able to quit your second job,
understand?

195
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:54,300
To take care of your daughter.

196
00:20:54,425 --> 00:20:58,804
Haven't I always done right by you?
I've always helped you and your family.

197
00:20:58,929 --> 00:21:02,850
80? Right?

198
00:21:05,686 --> 00:21:07,688
You're a son of a bitch, you know?

199
00:21:09,857 --> 00:21:11,108
So?

200
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:34,882
- And who's that?
- He's a friend. He's trustworthy.

201
00:21:35,007 --> 00:21:38,260
What's up, Quica?
This is the girl I told you about.

202
00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:45,851
Let's go.

203
00:21:46,435 --> 00:21:48,854
Take care, skinny!

204
00:21:51,273 --> 00:21:53,108
- All good?
- All good, brother.

205
00:21:53,234 --> 00:21:54,568
I'll follow you, brother.

206
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:58,197
- Who's that bitch?
- Close your fucking legs, Rosa.

207
00:21:58,322 --> 00:22:00,032
You'll kill all the flowers.

208
00:22:00,157 --> 00:22:03,118
You shit-eating bastard.
This pussy smells great.

209
00:22:04,328 --> 00:22:07,039
Now you buy your whores
at the market?

210
00:22:07,164 --> 00:22:08,791
Don't get pissy.

211
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:11,836
If you're in a better mood
when I come back this afternoon,

212
00:22:11,961 --> 00:22:13,546
you'll get to fuck me.

213
00:22:15,172 --> 00:22:17,299
Fucking Quica.

214
00:22:17,424 --> 00:22:20,427
Shut up! Go inside! Watch yourself!

215
00:24:14,208 --> 00:24:16,710
Ready? Close your eyes.

216
00:24:18,003 --> 00:24:19,046
All right.

217
00:24:20,255 --> 00:24:23,926
It's a little bunny, my love.
She's very delicate.

218
00:24:27,262 --> 00:24:28,514
Boss?

219
00:24:45,864 --> 00:24:47,449
Look, Don Pablo...

220
00:24:48,158 --> 00:24:51,078
this is the guy
I've been telling you about, Limón.

221
00:24:51,203 --> 00:24:52,496
He's Guarazapo's cousin.

222
00:24:54,123 --> 00:24:58,627
Limón! Come here, brother.
Come on!

223
00:25:05,092 --> 00:25:06,760
Pleasure to meet you, sir.

224
00:25:07,928 --> 00:25:10,681
Don't worry, boss.
We've known each other for a long time.

225
00:25:10,806 --> 00:25:13,892
Besides, the police don't know
who he is. He's clean.

226
00:25:14,018 --> 00:25:15,686
And where are you from, son?

227
00:25:15,811 --> 00:25:18,355
I was born in Envigado, sir.

228
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,941
My mother lives in the barrio
you built for us.

229
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,445
I'm very glad.

230
00:25:25,487 --> 00:25:27,322
- What about the girl?
- She...

231
00:25:27,448 --> 00:25:29,199
She's a friend, boss.

232
00:25:30,117 --> 00:25:32,911
We went to school together in Envigado.
I know her well

233
00:25:33,037 --> 00:25:36,957
and I know where she works,
so she's someone we can trust, boss.

234
00:25:39,251 --> 00:25:40,627
Listen, Limón...

235
00:25:44,631 --> 00:25:46,633
Do you know what it means
to work for me?

236
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:49,178
It's an honour to work for you,
Don Pablo.

237
00:25:50,345 --> 00:25:53,098
You've done so much
for the poor in Medellin...

238
00:25:55,726 --> 00:25:57,811
if I have to lose my life for you...

239
00:25:59,438 --> 00:26:01,023
I will, boss.

240
00:26:06,445 --> 00:26:07,863
All right.

241
00:26:10,824 --> 00:26:12,367
Open the trunk.

242
00:27:48,797 --> 00:27:50,924
Don't worry, brother. Everything's good.

243
00:28:17,451 --> 00:28:18,660
All yours.

244
00:28:31,798 --> 00:28:33,133
Where are we?

245
00:28:38,263 --> 00:28:41,308
- What the fuck are we doing here?
- Get down and hide.

246
00:28:41,433 --> 00:28:43,560
- Jhon, I don't...
- Shit, Maritza,

247
00:28:43,685 --> 00:28:47,397
I don't have time to give you
explanations. Just do it, all right?

248
00:29:19,429 --> 00:29:20,889
Don Pablo.

249
00:29:21,014 --> 00:29:22,432
- Hello.
- Welcome.

250
00:29:22,557 --> 00:29:25,644
Thank you. No, don't get up.
Don't get up.

251
00:29:25,769 --> 00:29:27,771
- How are you?
- Very well.

252
00:29:27,896 --> 00:29:29,439
Great, I'm very glad.

253
00:29:31,358 --> 00:29:34,361
- Rojas.
- Don Pablo.

254
00:29:34,486 --> 00:29:35,612
How have you been?

255
00:29:35,737 --> 00:29:37,698
Good, yourself?
I wasn't expecting you.

256
00:29:37,823 --> 00:29:39,533
- I'm well.
- Guys, please.

257
00:29:39,658 --> 00:29:41,118
Yes, sir.

258
00:29:41,243 --> 00:29:43,078
Do you want anything to drink, sir?

259
00:29:43,203 --> 00:29:44,454
- A coffee?
- No, thanks.

260
00:29:44,579 --> 00:29:47,791
- Anything?
- Thank you, I'm fine.

261
00:29:50,043 --> 00:29:52,629
- How are you?
- I'm well, sir. Everything is well.

262
00:29:52,754 --> 00:29:55,799
- How is Maribel?
- Maribel is well, sir. Thank you.

263
00:29:55,924 --> 00:29:57,467
Good, brother.

264
00:29:57,592 --> 00:30:00,012
What's going on with the deposits?

265
00:30:00,929 --> 00:30:02,180
They're looking a bit low.

266
00:30:02,806 --> 00:30:05,684
Well, after everything
that happened with...

267
00:30:06,435 --> 00:30:10,147
with Mr Gateano
and Mr Moncada, well...

268
00:30:10,272 --> 00:30:12,774
people are nervous, you understand?

269
00:30:12,899 --> 00:30:17,612
This woman, Judy Moncada,
has been saying things...

270
00:30:18,739 --> 00:30:20,657
So people don't want to pay.

271
00:30:25,412 --> 00:30:28,332
- That's it?
- That's it, sir. I thought you knew.

272
00:30:28,457 --> 00:30:32,461
- I told them to tell you...
- Calm down. Don't worry about that.

273
00:30:33,587 --> 00:30:36,673
We'll fix that problem soon.

274
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:38,008
Yes, sir.

275
00:30:40,886 --> 00:30:42,387
In the meantime...

276
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:47,017
I want you to move
to the offices in Laureles.

277
00:30:48,352 --> 00:30:50,479
It's no longer safe here.

278
00:30:50,604 --> 00:30:53,315
- Done, sir. Whatever you say.
- Good.

279
00:30:54,066 --> 00:30:55,734
And fill this up, please.

280
00:31:08,997 --> 00:31:10,207
Don Pablo!

281
00:31:10,707 --> 00:31:12,167
- Sir, how are...
- Is that you?

282
00:31:12,292 --> 00:31:14,461
- How are you, sir?
- Sweetie! Sweetie!

283
00:31:14,586 --> 00:31:17,839
Sweetie!
Don Pablo is in front of our house.

284
00:31:17,964 --> 00:31:19,299
Don Pablo?

285
00:31:19,424 --> 00:31:21,176
- Don Pablo!
- Ma'am, how are you?

286
00:31:21,301 --> 00:31:22,677
Fine, and you?

287
00:31:22,803 --> 00:31:24,971
- It's him, old man.
- Sir, how are you?

288
00:31:25,097 --> 00:31:27,391
- How is your health?
- It's good. Very good!

289
00:31:27,516 --> 00:31:29,935
Good. Good. How are all of you?
Good? Good?

290
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,603
- How are you, Don Pablo?
- Good.

291
00:31:31,728 --> 00:31:33,105
It's him.

292
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:34,689
In the flesh?

293
00:31:34,815 --> 00:31:38,193
- Good?
- Boss, we should get going.

294
00:31:38,318 --> 00:31:40,987
Let them see me. Let them see me.

295
00:31:41,113 --> 00:31:42,948
I never thought I'd meet you in person.

296
00:31:43,073 --> 00:31:44,783
I'm well, Ma'am, how are you?

297
00:31:44,908 --> 00:31:49,246
- Here, boss, behind you.
- Here. Let's see.

298
00:31:49,371 --> 00:31:52,457
- Generous as always, Don Pablo.
- For you.

299
00:31:52,582 --> 00:31:55,502
- Thank you, Don Pablo.
- For the doctor, sir. For the doctor.

300
00:31:55,627 --> 00:31:57,921
- Thank you, Don Pablo.
- Take care of yourself.

301
00:31:59,798 --> 00:32:01,216
For you, Ma'am.

302
00:32:02,008 --> 00:32:03,093
For you too, sir.

303
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:42,174
There's a girl on line three.
She wants to talk to an American.

304
00:32:54,769 --> 00:32:57,355
- What's wrong, brother?
- Suck my dick, please.

305
00:33:01,485 --> 00:33:04,821
- DEA Agent Peña.
<i>- Pay attention.</i>

306
00:33:05,489 --> 00:33:08,825
I know where you can find
one of Escobar's little men.

307
00:33:09,951 --> 00:33:11,203
<i>Oh, yeah? Which one?</i>

308
00:33:12,287 --> 00:33:14,289
There's a reward, right?

309
00:33:15,081 --> 00:33:17,042
Yes, there's a reward.

310
00:33:17,167 --> 00:33:20,212
What's your information, miss?
Who are you talking about?

311
00:33:23,256 --> 00:33:24,633
La Quica.

312
00:33:27,511 --> 00:33:28,803
La Quica?

313
00:33:29,721 --> 00:33:31,932
You know La Quica?

314
00:33:32,057 --> 00:33:34,601
He came to the brothel on 23rd street.

315
00:33:34,726 --> 00:33:37,395
He left with a man in a taxi,
said he'd come back later.

316
00:33:38,522 --> 00:33:40,148
Do you work there?

317
00:33:43,735 --> 00:33:44,778
<i>Yes.</i>

318
00:33:45,695 --> 00:33:46,947
How long ago was this?

319
00:33:48,532 --> 00:33:50,492
A couple of hours.

320
00:33:50,617 --> 00:33:53,328
All right, we'll look into it.

321
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:41,209
It would be worth investigating, Colonel.

322
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:43,461
We're not asking much.

323
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,022
<i>Did you close the lab?</i>

324
00:35:02,147 --> 00:35:03,898
Jesus Christ.

325
00:35:04,024 --> 00:35:07,360
No, Berna, I haven't and I won't
because it's not necessary.

326
00:35:08,445 --> 00:35:11,990
- Listen to me, Jaime...
<i>- No, you listen to me. Enough of this.</i>

327
00:35:12,115 --> 00:35:14,367
I already spoke with
Ricardo Prisco, right?

328
00:35:14,492 --> 00:35:16,870
He's with us. He supports us.

329
00:35:16,995 --> 00:35:19,456
Everything's good.
What else could we want?

330
00:35:19,581 --> 00:35:22,792
I told you to be careful
with those people, Jaime.

331
00:35:22,917 --> 00:35:24,002
<i>Pay attention to me.</i>

332
00:35:24,127 --> 00:35:27,714
<i>First, these guys have been with us
since Pablo killed Kiko, right?</i>

333
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:30,467
Second, Ricardo knows
that being loyal to Pablo

334
00:35:30,592 --> 00:35:32,177
means a bullet in the head.

335
00:35:32,302 --> 00:35:36,598
And third, and to ease your mind,
they're sending us men, for security...

336
00:35:36,723 --> 00:35:37,974
What?

337
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:41,311
So you gave these people
the address to the lab?

338
00:35:41,436 --> 00:35:44,230
<i>Don't be an idiot.
How else would they get here?</i>

339
00:35:45,231 --> 00:35:47,442
Jaime, listen to me.

340
00:35:47,567 --> 00:35:50,737
Get out of there now.
Get moving and come here right now!

341
00:35:50,862 --> 00:35:53,239
Listen to me, Berna!
Stop with the paranoia!

342
00:35:54,866 --> 00:35:56,826
<i>Jaime! Jaime! Come here now!</i>

343
00:35:56,951 --> 00:35:58,870
- Now!
- Come play, motherfuckers!

344
00:36:00,747 --> 00:36:02,624
<i>Jaime! Jaime!</i>

345
00:36:02,791 --> 00:36:04,334
Get out now!

346
00:36:07,796 --> 00:36:10,548
What's going on, Ricardo?

347
00:36:12,634 --> 00:36:14,469
You're fucking up, man.

348
00:36:15,428 --> 00:36:17,639
Ricardo, put that shit down, brother.

349
00:36:18,848 --> 00:36:21,142
Ricardo, put it down.
Pablo is weak, brother.

350
00:36:21,267 --> 00:36:23,186
You know this.

351
00:36:23,311 --> 00:36:25,647
The city's filled with cops.

352
00:36:27,023 --> 00:36:29,025
Pablo can't move, brother.

353
00:36:29,651 --> 00:36:31,778
Ricardo, put the gun down.

354
00:36:38,576 --> 00:36:40,328
Hello, Jaime.

355
00:36:42,455 --> 00:36:43,623
Jaime.

356
00:36:43,748 --> 00:36:46,960
- <i>Berna, how have you been?</i>
- Who's this?

357
00:36:47,085 --> 00:36:51,965
This is Pablo speaking. I imagine
you want to talk to Jaime, right?

358
00:36:55,009 --> 00:36:56,511
Berna, help me, man.

359
00:36:56,636 --> 00:37:00,432
Berna, talk to Pablo.
Explain everything, Berna! Help me!

360
00:37:00,557 --> 00:37:01,933
Pablo, no! Wait!

361
00:37:09,524 --> 00:37:11,985
And now, you fat bastard...

362
00:37:12,694 --> 00:37:17,490
we're coming after you
and that bitch you protect.

363
00:37:17,615 --> 00:37:20,827
Pablo, you've just made
the biggest mistake.

364
00:37:20,952 --> 00:37:22,662
<i>Tell the others...</i>

365
00:37:23,329 --> 00:37:24,372
Who is it?

366
00:37:25,248 --> 00:37:29,461
...that Pablo Escobar is to be respected,

367
00:37:29,586 --> 00:37:31,212
you son of a bitch.

368
00:37:37,469 --> 00:37:39,888
That son of a bitch!
His entire family, understand?

369
00:37:40,013 --> 00:37:43,016
I want everyone
in his fucking family dead!

370
00:37:43,141 --> 00:37:45,393
That fat fuck!

371
00:37:45,518 --> 00:37:48,396
Son of a bitch!

372
00:37:49,355 --> 00:37:50,857
Listen, Judy...

373
00:37:53,026 --> 00:37:56,488
I'm very sorry about Jaime,
and about all of these deaths.

374
00:37:56,613 --> 00:38:00,158
We have to accept
that we lost this time.

375
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:04,954
But you know what?
I'll be with you until the end.

376
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:09,250
And if you want to go head on
against Pablo, just say so.

377
00:38:09,375 --> 00:38:15,173
We'll find strong allies. And people.
A lot of people.

378
00:38:17,509 --> 00:38:18,593
Yes.

379
00:38:26,768 --> 00:38:28,019
You're right.

380
00:38:30,897 --> 00:38:32,106
Yes.

381
00:38:35,318 --> 00:38:38,321
I think we have to see things
for what they are.

382
00:38:38,446 --> 00:38:40,740
The truth, just as it is.

383
00:38:42,033 --> 00:38:44,244
And this is the truth, Berna:

384
00:38:46,412 --> 00:38:49,082
I know of someone who's very powerful.

385
00:38:50,792 --> 00:38:53,419
Someone who wants to kill Pablo
as much as I do.

386
00:39:09,644 --> 00:39:13,273
- You sure it's not a trap?
- I'm not sure of anything.

387
00:40:54,624 --> 00:40:55,833
Hello, Fernando.

388
00:40:59,671 --> 00:41:02,090
You did very well, sister.

389
00:41:03,174 --> 00:41:05,927
Look... you don't just get two,
you get three.

390
00:41:07,053 --> 00:41:13,476
You have a special talent, that's why
you get not two, but three green ones.

391
00:41:18,982 --> 00:41:24,028
What are you doing tonight, sweetie?
I know of a nice calm place.

392
00:41:24,153 --> 00:41:26,531
We could have fun.

393
00:41:27,448 --> 00:41:30,952
I can't.
I have to take care of my daughter.

394
00:41:35,289 --> 00:41:38,126
- Bitch. Give me 30 minutes, Limón.
- All right, brother.

395
00:41:38,251 --> 00:41:40,169
I'm going to fuck one of them.

396
00:41:44,424 --> 00:41:45,675
Sweetie...

397
00:41:47,885 --> 00:41:49,262
Thank you, Maritza.

398
00:41:57,729 --> 00:41:59,230
Bastard.

399
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:28,760
Excuse me! Excuse me! Excuse me!

400
00:42:51,282 --> 00:42:54,952
Right here, to the right.
It's the next right.

401
00:42:55,078 --> 00:42:57,455
Know the area well, don't you, Peñita?

402
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:59,457
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

403
00:45:04,332 --> 00:45:06,876
Yeah? You like that? Yeah?

404
00:45:09,921 --> 00:45:13,507
There's the taxi. Park on the left. There.

405
00:45:21,474 --> 00:45:23,351
Calm down! Calm down!

406
00:45:24,936 --> 00:45:26,687
OK, let's go.

407
00:45:29,815 --> 00:45:31,317
All right. Wait for me here.

408
00:45:52,838 --> 00:45:55,216
- Trujillo!
- Go around! Go around!

409
00:45:55,341 --> 00:45:57,009
Move! Move! Move!

410
00:45:57,927 --> 00:46:00,012
Move! Move! Move!

411
00:46:03,349 --> 00:46:04,475
Brother!

412
00:46:05,059 --> 00:46:06,519
Goddammit. What?

413
00:46:06,644 --> 00:46:08,729
- Quica! Quica!
- What's going on?

414
00:46:08,854 --> 00:46:10,690
Let's go, brother. Hurry up!

415
00:46:17,321 --> 00:46:19,365
Brother! Hurry, Quica!

416
00:46:45,266 --> 00:46:47,435
They're cops, brother! Run!

417
00:47:38,194 --> 00:47:41,238
Stop looking.
This is the best place to eat.

418
00:47:55,294 --> 00:47:56,879
The situation is that...

419
00:47:57,797 --> 00:48:02,635
your escape has left us without...
We don't have a lot of options.

420
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:05,930
If I hadn't escaped,
they would have killed me, Fernando.

421
00:48:07,223 --> 00:48:09,642
Or I'd rot in an American jail.

422
00:48:10,768 --> 00:48:16,607
- You will tell Gaviria...
- Gaviria is being crucified by the media.

423
00:48:17,817 --> 00:48:20,152
I think it's not a good time.

424
00:48:22,363 --> 00:48:26,117
You will tell Gaviria...

425
00:48:31,705 --> 00:48:35,709
I'm willing to go back to La Catedral
to finish my sentence.

426
00:48:35,835 --> 00:48:37,378
As you wish.

427
00:48:38,295 --> 00:48:41,465
- In the morning, I'll return to Bogotà.
- No, no, no, brother.

428
00:48:44,885 --> 00:48:51,559
We can't... leave for tomorrow
what we can do today.

429
00:48:51,684 --> 00:48:53,102
Right?

430
00:49:01,485 --> 00:49:04,405
Mr President,
Mr Fernando Duque is on the line.

431
00:49:07,366 --> 00:49:10,911
- I have nothing to say to him.
- I'll handle it. You go ahead.

432
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:14,790
Mr Duque.

433
00:49:14,915 --> 00:49:16,959
- Eduardo Sandoval speaking.
<i>- Mr Vice Minister,</i>

434
00:49:17,084 --> 00:49:20,087
I have an important
message from Mr Escobar.

435
00:49:21,547 --> 00:49:27,052
He says he's willing to negotiate the
conditions for his return to La Catedral.

436
00:49:29,805 --> 00:49:31,307
Turn on the television.

437
00:49:39,064 --> 00:49:42,276
- What did he say?
- He told us to turn on the TV.

438
00:50:04,256 --> 00:50:06,258
<i>Good evening, compatriots.</i>

439
00:50:06,383 --> 00:50:12,765
<i>In the last year and a half, we've
enjoyed the peace we'd been waiting</i>

440
00:50:12,890 --> 00:50:14,225
<i>for over a decade.</i>

441
00:50:15,893 --> 00:50:18,187
<i>Now we can go to work,</i>

442
00:50:18,312 --> 00:50:22,983
<i>drop our children off at school,
and enjoy life's small pleasures...</i>

443
00:50:24,109 --> 00:50:28,113
without the threat of violence
looming around every corner.

444
00:50:30,115 --> 00:50:33,160
This peace is now threatened
by Pablo Escobar's escape.

445
00:50:33,869 --> 00:50:39,416
Escobar has been named the bloodiest
narco-terrorist of all time.

446
00:50:41,544 --> 00:50:44,755
This history... changes today.

447
00:50:46,757 --> 00:50:48,801
<i>But I need your help.</i>

448
00:50:49,969 --> 00:50:53,806
<i>We must come together as a people,
as a country,</i>

449
00:50:53,931 --> 00:50:57,309
<i>so his reign of terror comes to an end
here and now.</i>

450
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:02,022
<i>This is why I'm before you now...</i>

451
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:07,736
<i>offering a reward of 1.4 million dollars</i>

452
00:51:07,861 --> 00:51:11,532
<i>for whoever gives information
leading to his capture.</i>

453
00:51:14,201 --> 00:51:17,329
<i>It is my hope
that through this reward...</i>

454
00:51:18,664 --> 00:51:22,543
<i>the day will finally come
when our country is free of his grip</i>

455
00:51:22,668 --> 00:51:28,382
<i>and ceases to be held hostage
by terror, intimidation...</i>

456
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:31,302
<i>and murder.</i>

457
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,762
I want to make it very clear...

458
00:51:34,805 --> 00:51:36,849
that under no circumstances...

459
00:51:38,225 --> 00:51:40,686
will I negotiate with Pablo Escobar.
