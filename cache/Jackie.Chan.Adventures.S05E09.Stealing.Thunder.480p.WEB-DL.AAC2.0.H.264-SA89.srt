1
00:00:01,701 --> 00:00:03,836
Jade: Previously on
<i>Jackie chan adventures...</i>

2
00:00:03,838 --> 00:00:06,338
Uncle: It is t'changzu,
the thunder demon!

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:10,109
Drago: And now
for the main attraction!

4
00:00:10,111 --> 00:00:11,543
Uncle: Aiyaah!

5
00:00:11,545 --> 00:00:14,913
Drago's absorbing power
of t'changzu!

6
00:00:20,286 --> 00:00:22,554
Drago: Now that I possess
the thunder chi of t'changzu

7
00:00:22,556 --> 00:00:25,257
and my own fire chi,

8
00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:27,626
there will be
no stopping me.

9
00:00:27,628 --> 00:00:30,029
Strikemaster ice: Yo,
you're going down, clown!

10
00:00:30,031 --> 00:00:31,497
Mc cobra: Yeah, you wish.

11
00:00:31,499 --> 00:00:33,932
Be droppin' you
like a bad habit.

12
00:00:33,934 --> 00:00:35,768
Yo!

13
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,939
Drago: Now do I have
your attention?

14
00:00:40,941 --> 00:00:42,941
Strikemaster ice:
- This dude needs to chill.

15
00:00:44,744 --> 00:00:46,912
Drago: Grr!

16
00:00:46,914 --> 00:00:49,948
Mc cobra: S'not really
convertible weather, d-man.

17
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:54,353
Drago:
Time to dump this dump.

18
00:00:55,922 --> 00:00:58,190
Tohru: I hate rain.

19
00:00:58,192 --> 00:00:59,324
Uncle: Quiet.

20
00:00:59,326 --> 00:01:03,195
Chi-o-matic senses presence
of duel demon chi.

21
00:01:03,197 --> 00:01:05,564
Drago must be near.

22
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:07,866
Jade: So let's throw 'em
a little surprise party,

23
00:01:07,868 --> 00:01:09,068
chan style.

24
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:12,337
Jackie: Jade, I told you
to stay by the car.

25
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:15,274
Jade: Hello!
You didn't say which car.

26
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:19,945
(Tohru shudders)

27
00:01:19,947 --> 00:01:24,049
Drago: Sounds like
we have junkyard rats.

28
00:01:27,954 --> 00:01:31,590
Time to put you all
out of my misery.

29
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,493
All: Aah!

30
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:11,897
Strikemaster ice: Yo,
it's time to throw down.

31
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:19,338
Uncle: Jackie, must get closer
to remove thunder demon chi

32
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,807
from snotty-nosed dragon!

33
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:24,243
Uncle needs distraction.

34
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:38,123
Jade: Nice timing, t.

35
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:48,000
Mc cobra: Yo, girlfriend.

36
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:50,602
You disrespectin'
my hizz-ouse.

37
00:02:50,604 --> 00:02:53,639
Jade: My bad.
I meant to dis you!

38
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,175
Mc cobra: Ha ha ha!

39
00:02:56,177 --> 00:02:58,076
You can run,
but you can't hide.

40
00:02:58,078 --> 00:03:00,279
(Jade imitates buzzer)
Wrong!

41
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,387
Jade: Peek-a-boo!

42
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:14,893
Jackie: Bwaaa!

43
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:17,496
Strikemaster ice: You're way
out of your league, gramps.

44
00:03:17,498 --> 00:03:21,567
Uncle: Smarty-pants teenager
want a piece of gramps?

45
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:26,205
Strikemaster ice: Ha ha ha!

46
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,417
Jade: Up high.

47
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:42,821
Down low.

48
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:44,089
Mc cobra: Too slow.

49
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:55,601
Drago: 2 chans
for the price of one.

50
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:05,143
Jade: Uh, how come scale face
isn't cooked cajun-style?

51
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:07,546
Uncle: Thunder demon chi
has allowed drago

52
00:04:07,548 --> 00:04:10,148
to absorb storm's power!

53
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,551
Drago: Rraah!

54
00:04:12,553 --> 00:04:14,553
(Horns honking)

55
00:04:14,555 --> 00:04:17,522
Jackie: Find something that
won't conduct
drago's lightning.

56
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:20,659
The tires!

57
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:31,069
Strikemaster ice: Ho ho ho!
Epic light show, d-dude.

58
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:33,071
(Mc cobra coughs)
Whoa.

59
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:36,141
They gotta be charcoal
briquettes under there.

60
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:39,177
Drago: Let's go.
It's moving day.

61
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:44,683
Jackie: Is everyone all right?

62
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:49,121
Uncle: Aiyaah!
Uncle not all right!

63
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:52,291
The longer punk demon
possesses thunder demon chi,

64
00:04:52,293 --> 00:04:56,295
the more difficult it will be
for uncle to remove!

65
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:05,537
Drew: Oh, yeah.

66
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:07,906
Float like a butterfly.
Sting like a--

67
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:10,208
right jab!
Right jab!

68
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,543
Ha! When I'm through,

69
00:05:11,545 --> 00:05:13,712
you're gonna be nothing
but spare parts!

70
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:15,213
Jade: Dream on, tin man.

71
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:17,616
Drew: Have a nice trip.

72
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:21,887
Winner and still
robomercs champion.

73
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:23,755
Learn from the master,
young one.

74
00:05:23,757 --> 00:05:25,023
Jade: T'ch, right.

75
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:26,491
Rematch, drew. Now.

76
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:27,826
It wouldn't be fair.

77
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:30,595
Face it, Jade,
- you need a lot more practice.

78
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:34,733
Uncle: Creating fire chi
removal spell is

79
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:37,235
a very difficult task.

80
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:40,672
Only much Patience
and concentration

81
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,774
will yield success.

82
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,179
Jade: Please, please,
please, please, please.

83
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:48,680
I'll do all my chores.

84
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:51,783
Jackie: You'll do all
your chores regardless.

85
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:53,352
Jade: Uncle Jackie,

86
00:05:53,354 --> 00:05:55,120
I'm like the only kid
in the world

87
00:05:55,122 --> 00:05:56,822
who doesn't have robomercs.

88
00:05:56,824 --> 00:05:58,223
Jackie: Ohh.

89
00:05:58,225 --> 00:06:00,292
Video games will distract you
from your studies.

90
00:06:00,294 --> 00:06:01,526
Jade: That's not true!

91
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,328
Program in
your mondo cool sayings,

92
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,529
that's creative writing.

93
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,365
Keeping score, that's math.

94
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:09,901
Honestly, robomercs is
more educational
than homework.

95
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:11,169
Jackie: We will see.

96
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:13,705
Jade: Translation:
Fuggedtaboutit.

97
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:16,641
Tohru: Perhaps a drop
of black widow saliva.

98
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:18,577
Uncle: Tohru, no!

99
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:22,013
Aiyaah!

100
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:25,650
Does uncle's shop
look waterproof?!

101
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:27,486
Tohru: Ohh.

102
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:32,124
Security guard:
Keep it movin', boys.

103
00:06:32,126 --> 00:06:34,793
Building's closed
for renovations.

104
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:36,628
Drago: Right. Ours.

105
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,234
Security guard: Uhh!

106
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:47,272
Strikemaster ice:
Yo, major d.,

107
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:49,207
why don't you let me
and the posse

108
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:51,076
trick out your new digs?

109
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:54,446
Drago: As long as it doesn't
interfere with my plans.

110
00:06:54,448 --> 00:06:56,681
Strikemaster ice: Sweet.

111
00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:58,683
Capt. Black: This was taken
by a surveillance camera

112
00:06:58,685 --> 00:07:01,019
at pacific steel
outside of Seattle.

113
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:06,591
Sheet metal, steel girders,
cast-iron pipes.

114
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:09,394
And that's not all.

115
00:07:09,396 --> 00:07:11,997
Similar crimes have been
reported throughout the area.

116
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:13,465
Roller coaster cars,

117
00:07:13,467 --> 00:07:15,700
a prefab swimming pool,

118
00:07:15,702 --> 00:07:18,603
even the sound system
at sea breeze stadium.

119
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,639
Jade: Talk about your shop
till you drop.

120
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:23,008
Jackie: But why is
strikemaster ice stealing

121
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,843
those particular items?

122
00:07:24,845 --> 00:07:26,812
Capt. Black:
<i>No se, compadre.</i>

123
00:07:26,814 --> 00:07:30,148
But, I'll bet where there's
ice, there's a
fire demon.

124
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,687
Tohru: It is very gray here,

125
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:37,989
very, very gray.

126
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:39,925
Jade: Cheer up, big t.
It's Seattle,

127
00:07:39,927 --> 00:07:42,928
home of grunge rock,
mega-mocha grandes, and--

128
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:45,130
Jackie: And soon
the thunderstorm of
the century,

129
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:47,232
if the weather reports
are correct.

130
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:48,834
Tohru: Grr.
Jackie: Oh, sorry.

131
00:07:48,836 --> 00:07:50,435
Jade: Come on, t.
I'm treating.

132
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:51,670
What'll you have?

133
00:07:51,672 --> 00:07:54,039
Tohru: Hmm.
Double mocha latte,

134
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:56,141
or chocochino
steamed Espresso,

135
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:58,910
or double decaf half-caff
with a twist?

136
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:02,080
Uncle: Hot <i> cha!</i>
À coffee is coffee!

137
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:04,049
Police radio: All units,
robbery in progress.

138
00:08:04,051 --> 00:08:05,851
Clarksman aircraft
manufacturing.

139
00:08:05,853 --> 00:08:09,054
3 youths on skateboards,
appear armed and dangerous,

140
00:08:09,056 --> 00:08:11,289
possibly using
some sort of flamethrower.

141
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,458
Jackie: Ice.
Tohru: No, thank you.

142
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,194
I prefer my coffee
piping hot.

143
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,268
Jade: Your attention,
please.

144
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,170
This flight has
been grounded.

145
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:28,640
Strikemaster ice: I thought
we put you dawgs to sleep.

146
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:53,798
Mc cobra: Ha ha ha!

147
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:57,969
Uncle: Uhh!

148
00:08:57,971 --> 00:09:00,205
Jade hyah!

149
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:13,485
Jackie: Where is drago?

150
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:16,021
Strikemaster ice: Kickin' it
in his new digs, where else?

151
00:09:16,023 --> 00:09:17,489
Love to stay and jaw,

152
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:19,991
but we've burned
too much daylight as it is.

153
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:21,226
Peace!

154
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:45,116
Jade: That's one way
to get more legroom.

155
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:54,326
(Whooshing)

156
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,464
(Whooshing)

157
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:01,032
Jackie: Uhh!

158
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,543
Bwaaa!

159
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:27,092
Dj fist: Uhh!

160
00:10:27,094 --> 00:10:29,995
Jade: Ooh.
That's gonna leave a mark.

161
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:33,531
Strikemaster ice:
We outta here.

162
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,702
Jade: Uncle Jackie,
they're getting away!

163
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:47,612
Jackie: Jade,
what are you doing?!

164
00:10:47,614 --> 00:10:49,447
Jade:
Is this a trick question?

165
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:55,820
Strikemaster ice:
One chan ka-Bob, coming up!

166
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:16,841
Strikemaster ice: Yo, d.

167
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:19,477
Check out the windage
we snagged.

168
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:23,648
Jade: Gotcha!

169
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:24,716
Jackie: Jade!

170
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:31,790
Jade:
I really gotta work on that
"look before you leap" thing.

171
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:38,763
Jackie: Drago could have taken
Jade anywhere in the city.

172
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:42,267
Uncle: No. Drago came
to Seattle with a purpose.

173
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:46,371
Discover purpose, and Jade's
location becomes clear.

174
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:47,906
Tohru: He certainly did not
come to Seattle

175
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:49,474
for the weather.

176
00:11:49,476 --> 00:11:51,476
Jackie: Perhaps he did.

177
00:11:51,478 --> 00:11:53,645
Uncle: Jackie, explain.

178
00:11:53,647 --> 00:11:55,513
Jackie: Drago's power
was magnified

179
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:56,815
when he was struck
by the lightning

180
00:11:56,817 --> 00:11:58,083
at the junkyard, so--

181
00:11:58,085 --> 00:12:00,585
tohru: So his new lair
would be easily accessible

182
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:04,456
to the power of Seattle's
frequent thunderstorms.

183
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:05,657
Uncle: One more thing,

184
00:12:05,659 --> 00:12:08,860
taller is better
for lightning rods.

185
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:13,131
Jade: No way.

186
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:16,167
Drago's new crib is
the space needle?

187
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:30,482
Jade: So this is what all
those freaky robberies
were about.

188
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:35,286
(Whooshing)

189
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,558
Jade: This place rocks!

190
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,528
Mc cobra: Waah! Ooh! Aah!

191
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:53,805
Jade: Whoa.
Life-sized robomercs.

192
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:59,077
Strikemaster ice:
Rule number one--

193
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:02,280
there are no rules.

194
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,548
Mc cobra: Yaah!

195
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:06,951
Dude,
you're seriously wack!

196
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,253
Strikemaster ice: Word.

197
00:13:08,255 --> 00:13:09,587
Drago, on intercom: Ice!

198
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,525
Strikemaster ice: Yo.
Drago: Playtime's over.

199
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:18,630
The storm's almost here.

200
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:20,331
Finish securing
the lightning rod.

201
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:21,699
Mc cobra: You got it, dawg.

202
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:25,904
I mean, sir, dawg.
Dawg sir!

203
00:13:25,906 --> 00:13:28,706
Drago: Once I absorb
the storm's lightning,

204
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:31,476
I'll be able
to wipe out entire cities.

205
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:34,312
No one will dare oppose me!

206
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:37,348
(Alarm beeping)

207
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:40,185
Drago: Except for those chans!

208
00:13:40,187 --> 00:13:42,320
I'll make the adjustments
up on the roof.

209
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:45,156
You three can deal
with our party crashers.

210
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:51,129
(Sniffs)

211
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:56,868
Jade: I gotta warn
uncle Jackie.

212
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:03,174
Jade, on p.A.: Uncle Jackie!
Come here, uncle Jackie!

213
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:05,109
Jackie: Jade,
where are you?

214
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:06,477
Jade: Uncle Jackie,
if you can hear me,

215
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:08,880
it's a trap!
Ice and his crew are--aah!

216
00:14:08,882 --> 00:14:10,281
Jackie: Jade?
Jade?!

217
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,893
Strikemaster ice: Yeah,
nothing like a roaring fire

218
00:14:21,895 --> 00:14:24,429
to warm up a rainy day.

219
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,773
Strikemaster ice:
Give it up, runt.

220
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:38,076
No way you gettin'
outta this room alive.

221
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:43,748
(Music blaring)

222
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:47,452
Strikemaster ice:
Aah! Aah! Uhh!

223
00:14:47,454 --> 00:14:49,921
Jade: What, no earplugs?

224
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:11,643
Uncle: Aiyaah-ah-ah-ah!

225
00:15:11,645 --> 00:15:15,947
(Dizzy)
Uncle doesn't feel so good.

226
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:17,215
Tohru: <i> Sensei!</i>
Àjackie: Uncle!

227
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:21,853
Uncle: Can't uncle have
one moment to clear head?

228
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:24,722
Mc cobra: Uhh!

229
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:26,257
Ohh!

230
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:29,560
Uncle: Must uncle
do everything?

231
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:39,270
Mc cobra: Uhh!

232
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,205
Jade: Uncle Jackie,
drago's up on the roof

233
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:43,174
tryin' to get supercharged
by the storm.

234
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:45,176
Jackie: Uncle and I
will stop drago.

235
00:15:45,178 --> 00:15:47,946
Tohru, take Jade outside
to safety.

236
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:50,014
Tohru: Uh, but it's
raining out there.

237
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:55,019
Jade: Ohh.

238
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:01,459
(Elevator music playing)

239
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,033
(Elevator chimes)

240
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:10,468
Drago: No visitors.

241
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:13,371
Jackie: Whoa!
Uncle: Aah!

242
00:16:13,373 --> 00:16:15,974
Jackie: I suspect
drago knows we are here.

243
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:19,877
Tohru: Uhh! Jade,
this is not helpful.

244
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,617
Huh?

245
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:29,654
Strikemaster ice:
Yo, peewee.

246
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:31,856
You and me got
some unfinished bidness.

247
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:37,128
Tohru: Jade, run!

248
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,930
Jade: I got your back, t.!

249
00:16:38,932 --> 00:16:40,565
Tohru: No!
The other way!

250
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:42,533
Whoa!

251
00:16:42,535 --> 00:16:45,069
Strikemaster ice: Looks like
it's just you and me, homes.

252
00:16:45,071 --> 00:16:46,738
<i>Mano a</i> sumo.

253
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:56,147
Uncle: This is why uncle's
shop on ground floor.

254
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:58,416
Tohru: Uhh!

255
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:11,662
Strikemaster ice: Ha ha ha!

256
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,770
Ah, snap!
Game over.

257
00:17:18,772 --> 00:17:21,906
Jade: Hey, why don't you pick
on somebody your own size?

258
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:24,108
Think you got game?

259
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,543
Bring it on.

260
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,480
Tohru: Whoa!

261
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:33,451
Strikemaster ice: Waah!

262
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:43,761
Jackie and uncle:
Bad day! Bad day!
Bad day! Bad day!

263
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:48,232
Jackie: We're pulling
your plug, drago.

264

Uncle: <i> Yumo guay guai</i>

The storm has arrived!

268
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:02,346
Uncle: Jackie!

269
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:07,885
Jackie: I know!
We need a distraction.

270
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:17,528
Strikemaster ice:
Not bad for a short stack.

271
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:21,699
But today, first is best,
and second is dead last.

272
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,175
Jade: Think I'm ready
for that rematch now, drew.

273
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:34,145
(Gasping)

274
00:18:34,147 --> 00:18:36,848
Jade: Aw,
the ice man's all wet.

275
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:38,116
We'd better get
you dried off

276
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:40,318
before you catch
something nasty.

277

don't tell me we missed
all the fireworks?

287
00:19:26,566 --> 00:19:29,867
Drago: You can't defeat me!

288
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:32,136
I'm on top of the world!

289
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,786
Jackie: Jade,
I have reconsidered.

290
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:50,188
If you promise to play

291
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,690
only after your homework
is completed,

292
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:55,359
you may have
the robomercs game.

293
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:56,894
Jade: No, thanks,
uncle Jackie.

294
00:19:56,896 --> 00:19:58,095
Been there. Done that.

295
00:19:58,097 --> 00:20:01,899
Jackie: Well, I am
very proud of you.

296
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:07,838
Tohru: Jade, I do not believe
this will fit

297
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,407
in the overhead compartment.

298
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:17,949
Jade: Hey, Jackie, do you like
riding roller coasters?

299
00:20:17,951 --> 00:20:21,852
Jackie: I do like these kind
of exciting games.

300
00:20:21,854 --> 00:20:25,923
Roller coaster, airplane,
everything high, fast.

301
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:28,326
It makes my blood go fast,
then I like it.

302
00:20:28,328 --> 00:20:31,462
I don't know why I like
these kind of things.
