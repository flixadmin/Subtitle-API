1
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:04,334
Oi!

2
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,253
Mind out.

3
00:02:09,464 --> 00:02:10,506
Move!

4
00:02:25,605 --> 00:02:27,398
Look, on the west wall!

5
00:02:28,441 --> 00:02:30,026
Get down to the crypt!

6
00:02:32,904 --> 00:02:34,238
Just hold.

7
00:02:35,365 --> 00:02:36,532
We'll take him.

8
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:42,514
Come on, help the lads!

9
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:43,539
Yes, my lady.

10
00:02:43,623 --> 00:02:46,626
Quickly, now! Quickly!
Get those in position.

11
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:48,920
- Come on.
- Close the gate!

12
00:02:49,796 --> 00:02:50,838
That's it.

13
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,800
Episode 3 - The Long Night.

14
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:34,168
Oh.
You took your time.

15
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,377
Do you speak their tongue?

16
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:45,383
Tell them to lift their swords.

17
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:31,030
Valar Morghulis.

18
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:32,573
Valar Dohaeris.

19
00:09:47,797 --> 00:09:49,048
Open the gate!

20
00:09:49,131 --> 00:09:50,382
Open the gate!

21
00:09:50,466 --> 00:09:51,550
Open the gate!

22
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,360
Come. Come on.

23
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:11,654
Easy.

24
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:41,100
There's no need to execute me,
Ser Davos.

25
00:10:41,183 --> 00:10:43,060
I'll be dead before the dawn.

26
00:12:43,681 --> 00:12:46,850
Cease fire!

27
00:14:26,742 --> 00:14:28,494
The Night King is coming.

28
00:14:30,621 --> 00:14:32,247
The dead are already here.

29
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,626
Stand your ground!

30
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,570
Get down to the crypt.

31
00:17:51,363 --> 00:17:53,156
I'm not abandoning my people.

32
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,283
Take this and go.

33
00:17:58,412 --> 00:17:59,955
I don't know how to use it.

34
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:02,541
Stick them with the pointy end.

35
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:30,754
Edd!

36
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,465
Edd!

37
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:53,819
Sam, get up!

38
00:19:58,782 --> 00:20:01,076
Oh, God. Sam.

39
00:21:48,058 --> 00:21:50,769
Fall back! Fall back!

40
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:55,106
Fall back!

41
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,316
Come on!

42
00:21:57,943 --> 00:21:59,027
Open the gate!

43
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,987
Open the gate!

44
00:22:01,071 --> 00:22:02,155
Let us in!

45
00:22:04,533 --> 00:22:05,867
Open the gate!

46
00:22:05,951 --> 00:22:07,452
Open the gate!

47
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:11,373
Keep moving!

48
00:22:15,293 --> 00:22:16,461
Come on!

49
00:22:20,048 --> 00:22:22,467
- Keep moving, fast.
- To your posts.

50
00:22:22,551 --> 00:22:24,427
- Go!
- Keep moving!

51
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:28,098
Come on, run!

52
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:29,182
Keep moving!

53
00:22:35,856 --> 00:22:37,858
Protect the retreat!

54
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:43,572
Stand your ground!

55
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:25,947
Dany!

56
00:23:52,891 --> 00:23:54,768
Grab your weapon now!

57
00:23:54,851 --> 00:23:56,436
Guard the barricades!

58
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:58,730
Through that pass!

59
00:23:58,813 --> 00:24:00,440
Hey! Hey! Hey!

60
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:01,775
Close up the gaps!

61
00:24:01,858 --> 00:24:04,778
Go! Hey! Go! Go!

62
00:24:04,861 --> 00:24:06,780
Get in! Get in!

63
00:24:06,863 --> 00:24:08,573
Get in! Come on!

64
00:24:43,358 --> 00:24:44,401
Move!

65
00:25:14,764 --> 00:25:17,934
Retreat!

66
00:25:18,351 --> 00:25:19,894
Retreat!

67
00:25:19,978 --> 00:25:21,479
- Come on!
- Come on!

68
00:25:21,563 --> 00:25:22,981
- Come on!
- Come on!

69
00:25:25,108 --> 00:25:26,484
Protect the gate!

70
00:25:26,568 --> 00:25:28,570
Protect the gate!

71
00:25:28,653 --> 00:25:31,072
They're coming! Come on!

72
00:25:31,156 --> 00:25:32,782
Fall back!

73
00:25:52,927 --> 00:25:54,262
Light the trench!

74
00:25:54,345 --> 00:25:55,889
Light the trench!

75
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:59,150
- Wait!
- Light the trench!

76
00:26:29,005 --> 00:26:30,256
She can't see us.

77
00:26:31,883 --> 00:26:33,009
Light the trenches!

78
00:26:47,565 --> 00:26:49,734
With a torch,
light the trenches!

79
00:26:49,818 --> 00:26:52,112
- Right there.
- Torch it!

80
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:54,781
Light the trenches!

81
00:29:39,696 --> 00:29:40,738
Clegane.

82
00:29:47,036 --> 00:29:49,622
You must try not to worry yourself.

83
00:30:02,802 --> 00:30:05,096
At least we're already in a crypt.

84
00:30:09,767 --> 00:30:11,019
If we were up there,

85
00:30:11,936 --> 00:30:15,023
we might see something
everyone else is missing.

86
00:30:17,108 --> 00:30:18,468
Something that makes a difference.

87
00:30:20,403 --> 00:30:21,446
What?

88
00:30:21,988 --> 00:30:24,508
Remember the Battle of Blackwater?
I brought us through the Mud Gate.

89
00:30:24,532 --> 00:30:27,618
- And got your face cut in half.
- And it made a difference.

90
00:30:30,204 --> 00:30:31,581
If I was out there right now...

91
00:30:31,706 --> 00:30:32,749
You'd die.

92
00:30:35,084 --> 00:30:36,919
There's nothing you can do.

93
00:30:41,174 --> 00:30:43,468
You might be surprised
at the lengths I'd go

94
00:30:43,551 --> 00:30:46,054
to avoid joining
the Army of the Dead.

95
00:30:46,137 --> 00:30:49,182
I could think of no organization
less suited to my talents.

96
00:30:49,307 --> 00:30:50,975
Witty remarks
won't make a difference.

97
00:30:54,187 --> 00:30:56,439
That's why we're down here,
none of us can do anything.

98
00:30:58,941 --> 00:31:00,068
It's the truth.

99
00:31:01,361 --> 00:31:03,654
It's the most heroic thing
we can do now...

100
00:31:05,615 --> 00:31:07,158
look the truth in the face.

101
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,374
Maybe we should have stayed married.

102
00:31:14,999 --> 00:31:16,751
You were the best of them.

103
00:31:18,044 --> 00:31:20,171
What a terrifying thought.

104
00:31:27,261 --> 00:31:28,596
It wouldn't work between us.

105
00:31:29,889 --> 00:31:31,057
Why not?

106
00:31:31,808 --> 00:31:33,059
The Dragon Queen.

107
00:31:35,228 --> 00:31:38,231
Your divided loyalties
would become a problem.

108
00:31:38,981 --> 00:31:40,066
Yes.

109
00:31:41,484 --> 00:31:44,112
Without the Dragon Queen,
there'd be no problem at all.

110
00:31:45,321 --> 00:31:46,823
We'd all be dead already.

111
00:32:09,053 --> 00:32:10,346
They lit the trench.

112
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:25,153
Bran...

113
00:32:30,658 --> 00:32:32,577
I just want you to know...

114
00:32:36,581 --> 00:32:37,623
I wish...

115
00:32:39,208 --> 00:32:40,418
The things I did...

116
00:32:40,501 --> 00:32:43,296
Everything you did
brought you where you are now.

117
00:32:45,548 --> 00:32:46,757
Where you belong.

118
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:50,052
Home.

119
00:33:01,022 --> 00:33:02,565
I'm going to go now.

120
00:33:05,693 --> 00:33:06,736
Go where?

121
00:34:55,511 --> 00:34:56,846
Man the walls!

122
00:34:57,763 --> 00:34:59,682
Man the walls!

123
00:35:07,732 --> 00:35:09,150
Man the wall!

124
00:35:09,984 --> 00:35:11,569
Man the walls!

125
00:35:13,404 --> 00:35:14,530
Come on!

126
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:17,366
Get out there! Get moving!

127
00:35:18,117 --> 00:35:20,244
Come on. Come on! Come on!

128
00:35:23,581 --> 00:35:25,333
Go, go, go!

129
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,043
Come on!

130
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:09,210
They're against the wall!

131
00:36:13,589 --> 00:36:15,341
Get more men up here!

132
00:36:19,261 --> 00:36:21,722
- Fill the gaps, quickly!
- Get in there!

133
00:36:21,806 --> 00:36:23,116
They're climbing the walls!

134
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,726
- Relieve the archers!
- Relieve the archers!

135
00:36:27,728 --> 00:36:29,188
Archers on top!

136
00:36:29,271 --> 00:36:31,941
- Move up!
- Go, go! Come here!

137
00:36:32,024 --> 00:36:33,651
- Come on!
- Move back!

138
00:36:33,734 --> 00:36:35,462
- Stand away!
- Go on, go on. Go! Go.

139
00:36:35,486 --> 00:36:37,822
- Step back.
- All the way, archers!

140
00:36:54,088 --> 00:36:55,214
Hold the wall!

141
00:36:55,297 --> 00:36:56,733
The wall,
they're coming up!

142
00:36:56,757 --> 00:37:00,010
- Hold the wall!
- Hold the wall!

143
00:37:00,094 --> 00:37:01,262
Draw!

144
00:37:25,494 --> 00:37:27,121
Come on!

145
00:38:18,088 --> 00:38:19,590
They're coming up!

146
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:32,728
Look out!

147
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:12,995
Clegane!

148
00:40:14,288 --> 00:40:15,372
Clegane!

149
00:41:25,901 --> 00:41:27,820
Clegane!

150
00:41:27,903 --> 00:41:29,613
Clegane, we need you!

151
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,657
You can't give up on us.

152
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,909
We can't beat them.

153
00:41:33,993 --> 00:41:36,286
Don't you see that, you stupid

154
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:38,122
We're fighting Death!

155
00:41:38,205 --> 00:41:39,540
They can't beat Death.

156
00:41:44,461 --> 00:41:45,754
Tell her that.

157
00:42:20,748 --> 00:42:21,999
Ahhh!

158
00:49:20,333 --> 00:49:21,543
Open the door!

159
00:49:24,588 --> 00:49:25,714
Open the door!

160
00:49:25,797 --> 00:49:27,233
- Come on!
- Open the door!

161
00:49:27,257 --> 00:49:28,842
Open the door!

162
00:49:33,597 --> 00:49:34,639
Please!

163
00:49:35,474 --> 00:49:36,892
Open it!

164
00:51:11,611 --> 00:51:13,822
Come on! Go!

165
00:51:14,573 --> 00:51:17,075
- Come on!
- Run!

166
00:51:43,226 --> 00:51:44,519
We've gotta go!

167
00:52:46,331 --> 00:52:48,500
The Lord brought him back
for a purpose.

168
00:52:53,463 --> 00:52:55,674
Now that purpose has been served.

169
00:53:01,054 --> 00:53:02,097
I know you.

170
00:53:07,769 --> 00:53:08,812
And I know you.

171
00:53:16,778 --> 00:53:18,321
You said we'd meet again.

172
00:53:19,114 --> 00:53:20,365
And here we are.

173
00:53:21,366 --> 00:53:22,659
At the end of the world.

174
00:53:24,911 --> 00:53:26,746
You said I'd shut many eyes forever.

175
00:53:28,456 --> 00:53:29,999
You were right about that too.

176
00:53:31,126 --> 00:53:32,210
Brown eyes...

177
00:53:32,961 --> 00:53:34,295
green eyes...

178
00:53:36,506 --> 00:53:37,882
and blue eyes.

179
00:53:57,235 --> 00:53:59,988
What do we say to the God of Death?

180
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,326
Not today.

181
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:31,853
Here they come!

182
00:54:35,690 --> 00:54:36,775
Steady, lads.

183
00:54:37,942 --> 00:54:39,110
Steady now.

184
00:54:41,988 --> 00:54:43,323
Make every shot count.

185
00:54:52,832 --> 00:54:53,875
Over there!

186
00:54:57,128 --> 00:54:58,171
There!

187
00:55:38,753 --> 00:55:39,921
Get off.

188
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:18,102
Dracarys.

189
01:02:02,094 --> 01:02:03,679
Come on! Come on!

190
01:02:05,806 --> 01:02:08,059
No! No, no, no!

191
01:02:57,984 --> 01:03:00,361
- Bran!
- Go!

192
01:08:18,262 --> 01:08:19,471
Jorah!

193
01:11:05,053 --> 01:11:06,138
Theon.

194
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:19,359
You're a good man.

195
01:11:25,407 --> 01:11:26,450
Thank you.

196
01:16:50,273 --> 01:16:51,858
I'm hurt.
