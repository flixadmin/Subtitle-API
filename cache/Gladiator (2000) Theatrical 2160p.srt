1
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:18,452
Sir.

2
00:03:18,536 --> 00:03:19,787
General.

3
00:03:30,673 --> 00:03:31,799
Sir.

4
00:03:46,814 --> 00:03:48,482
Lean and hungry.

5
00:03:51,652 --> 00:03:54,363
-Still nothing?
-Not a sign.

6
00:03:54,447 --> 00:03:57,325
-How long has he been gone?
-Nearly two hours.

7
00:04:00,328 --> 00:04:02,079
Will they fight, sir?

8
00:04:02,163 --> 00:04:03,664
We shall know soon enough.

9
00:04:03,748 --> 00:04:06,292
Soldier, I ordered you
to move those catapults forward.

10
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:08,669
-They're out of range.
-Range is good.

11
00:04:10,338 --> 00:04:13,799
-The danger to the cavalry...
-Is acceptable. Agreed?

12
00:04:23,476 --> 00:04:24,560
They say no.

13
00:04:50,503 --> 00:04:53,047
People should know
when they're conquered.

14
00:05:03,516 --> 00:05:05,309
Would you, Quintus?

15
00:05:06,227 --> 00:05:07,520
Would I?

16
00:05:24,245 --> 00:05:26,956
-Strength and honor.
-Strength and honor.

17
00:05:32,586 --> 00:05:35,756
At my signal, unleash hell.

18
00:05:58,446 --> 00:05:59,989
Load the catapults.

19
00:06:00,865 --> 00:06:02,825
Infantry form up for advance.

20
00:06:04,285 --> 00:06:06,704
-Archers ready.
-Archers!

21
00:06:06,787 --> 00:06:08,289
-Nock!
-Nock!

22
00:06:32,063 --> 00:06:33,439
<i>Fratres!</i>

23
00:06:33,522 --> 00:06:35,357
-Maximus!
-Maximus!

24
00:06:36,817 --> 00:06:40,905
Three weeks from now,
I will be harvesting my crops.

25
00:06:40,988 --> 00:06:45,451
Imagine where you will be,
and it will be so.

26
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,497
Hold the line! Stay with me!

27
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:52,249
If you find yourself alone,

28
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:55,336
riding in green fields
with the sun on your face,

29
00:06:56,545 --> 00:06:58,714
do not be troubled.

30
00:06:59,548 --> 00:07:03,177
For you are in Elysium,
and you're already dead!

31
00:07:05,346 --> 00:07:07,014
Brothers,

32
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,226
what we do in life

33
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,937
echoes in eternity.

34
00:07:21,445 --> 00:07:22,738
Pull!

35
00:07:38,379 --> 00:07:40,381
Cohorts ready, sir!

36
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,394
Archers, ignite!

37
00:07:53,644 --> 00:07:56,272
-Ignite!
-Ignite!

38
00:08:02,153 --> 00:08:04,822
Archers, draw!

39
00:08:08,284 --> 00:08:09,660
Loose!

40
00:08:38,814 --> 00:08:40,774
All right, men, ready!

41
00:08:46,655 --> 00:08:48,574
Hold the line!

42
00:08:56,832 --> 00:08:58,959
Loose!

43
00:08:59,043 --> 00:09:00,502
Reload!

44
00:09:05,549 --> 00:09:07,551
Hold the line!

45
00:09:07,635 --> 00:09:09,970
-Draw!
-Loose!

46
00:09:12,514 --> 00:09:14,308
Stay with me!

47
00:09:19,647 --> 00:09:21,899
Stay with me!

48
00:09:49,843 --> 00:09:52,763
<i>Roma victor!</i>

49
00:12:25,749 --> 00:12:27,709
<i>Roma victor!</i>

50
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,045
Do you think he's really dying?

51
00:13:13,463 --> 00:13:15,465
He's been dying for 10 years.

52
00:13:16,884 --> 00:13:19,970
If he weren't really dying,
he wouldn't have sent for us.

53
00:13:20,053 --> 00:13:21,847
Maybe he just misses us.

54
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:24,516
And the senators?
He wouldn't have summoned them if...

55
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,893
Peace, Commodus.

56
00:13:25,976 --> 00:13:27,269
After two weeks on the road,

57
00:13:27,352 --> 00:13:30,022
your incessant scheming
is hurting my head.

58
00:13:37,446 --> 00:13:40,866
He's made his decision.
He's going to announce it.

59
00:13:44,453 --> 00:13:46,413
He will name me.

60
00:13:49,249 --> 00:13:52,920
The first thing I shall do when...

61
00:13:55,714 --> 00:13:59,009
Is honor him with games
worthy of His Majesty.

62
00:13:59,092 --> 00:14:03,931
For now, the first thing I shall do
is have a hot bath.

63
00:14:05,682 --> 00:14:07,434
Your Highness?

64
00:14:11,104 --> 00:14:13,232
We seem to be almost there, sir.

65
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,615
-Sire.
-Where's the Emperor?

66
00:14:21,698 --> 00:14:25,369
He's at the front, sire.
They've been gone for 19 days.

67
00:14:25,452 --> 00:14:27,663
The wounded are still coming in.

68
00:14:27,746 --> 00:14:29,373
My horse.

69
00:14:29,456 --> 00:14:31,124
My lord.

70
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:35,754
Kiss?

71
00:15:11,707 --> 00:15:15,210
You have proved your valor
yet again, Maximus.

72
00:15:17,379 --> 00:15:20,090
Let us hope, for the last time.

73
00:15:20,507 --> 00:15:22,759
There's no one left to fight, sire.

74
00:15:22,843 --> 00:15:25,512
There is always someone left to fight.

75
00:15:25,595 --> 00:15:28,515
How can I reward
Rome's greatest general?

76
00:15:33,979 --> 00:15:35,522
Let me go home.

77
00:15:38,108 --> 00:15:39,318
Home.

78
00:15:58,086 --> 00:15:59,671
They honor you, Caesar.

79
00:15:59,755 --> 00:16:02,549
It's for you, Maximus. They honor you.

80
00:16:25,572 --> 00:16:28,241
Have I missed it?
Have I missed the battle?

81
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:31,703
You have missed the war.

82
00:16:31,787 --> 00:16:33,997
Father, congratulations.

83
00:16:34,623 --> 00:16:36,875
I shall sacrifice 100 bulls
to honor your triumph.

84
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:38,627
Save the bulls.

85
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:41,171
Honor Maximus. He won the battle.

86
00:16:41,588 --> 00:16:43,924
-General.
-Highness.

87
00:16:44,925 --> 00:16:48,512
Rome salutes you,
and I embrace you as a brother.

88
00:16:48,595 --> 00:16:50,389
It has been too long, my old friend.

89
00:16:50,472 --> 00:16:51,932
Highness.

90
00:16:52,015 --> 00:16:54,601
Here, Father. Take my arm.

91
00:16:56,186 --> 00:16:59,398
I think it is time for me to leave.

92
00:17:14,496 --> 00:17:17,833
So much for the glory of Rome.

93
00:17:38,061 --> 00:17:39,729
Magnificent battle.

94
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:05,380
General. Still alive?

95
00:18:05,464 --> 00:18:06,756
Still alive.

96
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,467
The gods must have a sense of humor.

97
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:11,219
-The gods must love you.
-Valerius.

98
00:18:11,303 --> 00:18:14,181
Back to barracks, General?
Or to Rome?

99
00:18:14,264 --> 00:18:17,350
Home. My wife, my son, the harvest.

100
00:18:17,976 --> 00:18:21,313
Maximus the farmer.
I still have difficulty imagining that.

101
00:18:21,396 --> 00:18:25,025
You know, dirt cleans off
a lot easier than blood, Quintus.

102
00:18:25,108 --> 00:18:27,194
-Here he is.
-Highness.

103
00:18:27,277 --> 00:18:29,446
Senator Gaius, Senator Falco.

104
00:18:29,529 --> 00:18:32,407
Beware of Gaius. He'll pour
a honeyed potion in your ear,

105
00:18:32,491 --> 00:18:36,077
and you'll wake up one day and all you'll
say is, "Republic, republic, republic."

106
00:18:36,161 --> 00:18:38,830
Well, why not?
Rome was founded as a republic.

107
00:18:38,914 --> 00:18:41,791
Yes, and in a republic
the senate has the power.

108
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:44,085
But Senator Gaius
isn't influenced by that, of course.

109
00:18:44,169 --> 00:18:47,172
Where do you stand, General?
Emperor or Senate?

110
00:18:47,255 --> 00:18:48,507
A soldier has the advantage

111
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:52,010
of being able to
look his enemy in the eye, Senator.

112
00:18:52,093 --> 00:18:56,097
Well, with an army behind you,
you could be extremely political.

113
00:18:56,181 --> 00:18:59,309
I warned you. Now I shall save you.
Senators.

114
00:19:09,152 --> 00:19:10,570
Maximus.

115
00:19:11,655 --> 00:19:14,157
I'm going to need good men like you.

116
00:19:16,284 --> 00:19:18,828
How may I be of service, Highness?

117
00:19:18,912 --> 00:19:21,957
You're a man who knows what it is
to command.

118
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:25,377
You give your orders, the orders
are obeyed, and the battle is won.

119
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:30,257
But these senators scheme, squabble
and flatter and deceive.

120
00:19:30,757 --> 00:19:33,802
Maximus, we must save Rome
from the politicians, my friend.

121
00:19:33,885 --> 00:19:37,013
Can I count on you
when the time comes?

122
00:19:42,978 --> 00:19:45,772
Highness, when your father releases
me, I intend to return home.

123
00:19:45,855 --> 00:19:49,025
Home? Well, no one's earned it more.

124
00:19:50,569 --> 00:19:54,364
Don't get too comfortable.
I may call on you before long.

125
00:19:56,449 --> 00:19:59,035
Lucilia's here. Did you know?

126
00:19:59,536 --> 00:20:01,454
She's not forgotten you.

127
00:20:02,747 --> 00:20:05,083
And now, you're the great man.

128
00:20:17,387 --> 00:20:19,889
If only you had been born a man,

129
00:20:20,932 --> 00:20:23,226
what a Caesar you would have made.

130
00:20:24,894 --> 00:20:26,354
Father.

131
00:20:32,402 --> 00:20:34,362
You would have been strong.

132
00:20:34,446 --> 00:20:37,699
I wonder, would you have been just?

133
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:41,119
I would have been
what you taught me to be.

134
00:20:43,121 --> 00:20:44,664
How was your journey?

135
00:20:44,748 --> 00:20:48,501
Long. Uncomfortable.
Why have I come?

136
00:20:49,085 --> 00:20:51,671
I need your help. With your brother.

137
00:20:52,005 --> 00:20:53,798
Of course.

138
00:20:53,882 --> 00:20:56,009
He loves you. He always has.

139
00:20:57,093 --> 00:20:58,261
And

140
00:21:00,138 --> 00:21:03,308
he will need you now, more than ever.

141
00:21:08,396 --> 00:21:10,273
Enough of politics.

142
00:21:10,523 --> 00:21:13,485
Let us pretend
that you are a loving daughter,

143
00:21:14,069 --> 00:21:16,446
and I am a good father.

144
00:21:21,993 --> 00:21:24,746
This is a pleasant fiction, isn't it?

145
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:39,219
Good morning to you.

146
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,901
I need three more horses.

147
00:22:03,535 --> 00:22:06,955
One! Two! Three!

148
00:22:07,747 --> 00:22:08,957
Four

149
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,292
One! Two!

150
00:22:27,517 --> 00:22:29,436
You sent for me, Caesar?

151
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:37,068
-Caesar?
-Tell me again, Maximus.

152
00:22:38,153 --> 00:22:39,863
Why are we here?

153
00:22:41,197 --> 00:22:43,700
For the glory of the empire, sire.

154
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:45,201
Yes.

155
00:22:47,245 --> 00:22:49,205
Yes, I remember.

156
00:22:52,292 --> 00:22:54,544
Do you see that map, Maximus?

157
00:22:55,378 --> 00:22:57,881
That is the world which I created.

158
00:22:58,757 --> 00:23:00,383
For 25 years,

159
00:23:00,884 --> 00:23:04,804
I have conquered, spilt blood,
expanded the empire.

160
00:23:06,222 --> 00:23:09,976
Since I became Caesar,
I've known four years without war.

161
00:23:10,059 --> 00:23:12,562
Four years of peace in 20.

162
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,355
And for what?

163
00:23:21,738 --> 00:23:25,575
I brought the sword. Nothing more.

164
00:23:26,868 --> 00:23:28,161
Caesar, your life...

165
00:23:28,244 --> 00:23:30,830
Please. Please don't call me that.

166
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,374
Come. Please.

167
00:23:34,167 --> 00:23:35,543
Come sit.

168
00:23:36,377 --> 00:23:39,088
Let us talk together now,

169
00:23:39,964 --> 00:23:42,091
very simply, as men.

170
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:44,594
Well, Maximus,

171
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:48,139
talk.

172
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:54,103
Five thousand of my men are out there
in the freezing mud.

173
00:23:54,187 --> 00:23:55,980
Three thousand of them
are bloodied and cleaved.

174
00:23:56,064 --> 00:23:57,524
Two thousand will
never leave this place.

175
00:23:57,607 --> 00:24:00,819
I will not believe that they fought
and died for nothing.

176
00:24:00,902 --> 00:24:02,529
And what would you believe?

177
00:24:02,612 --> 00:24:06,449
They fought for you and for Rome.

178
00:24:06,533 --> 00:24:08,326
And what is Rome, Maximus?

179
00:24:10,495 --> 00:24:12,914
I've seen much of the rest of the world.

180
00:24:12,997 --> 00:24:17,001
It is brutal and cruel and dark.
Rome is the light.

181
00:24:17,085 --> 00:24:19,003
Yet you have never been there.

182
00:24:19,087 --> 00:24:21,548
You have not seen what it has become.

183
00:24:21,631 --> 00:24:24,676
I am dying, Maximus.

184
00:24:25,301 --> 00:24:26,594
When a man sees his end,

185
00:24:26,678 --> 00:24:29,722
he wants to know there was
some purpose to his life.

186
00:24:30,849 --> 00:24:34,018
How will the world speak my name
in years to come?

187
00:24:34,102 --> 00:24:36,396
Will I be known as the philosopher?

188
00:24:36,479 --> 00:24:37,981
The warrior?

189
00:24:38,273 --> 00:24:39,691
The tyrant?

190
00:24:41,192 --> 00:24:45,822
Or will I be the Emperor
who gave Rome back her true self?

191
00:24:46,823 --> 00:24:49,242
There was once a dream
that was Rome.

192
00:24:49,325 --> 00:24:52,078
You could only whisper it.

193
00:24:52,161 --> 00:24:55,248
Anything more than a whisper
and it would vanish,

194
00:24:55,331 --> 00:24:57,166
it was so fragile.

195
00:24:57,458 --> 00:25:01,170
And I fear that it will not survive
the winter.

196
00:25:02,755 --> 00:25:04,173
Maximus,

197
00:25:05,049 --> 00:25:08,011
let us whisper now,

198
00:25:08,219 --> 00:25:09,971
together, you and I.

199
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,181
You have a son.

200
00:25:13,683 --> 00:25:15,560
Tell me about your home.

201
00:25:21,774 --> 00:25:24,694
My house is in the hills above Trujillo.

202
00:25:26,029 --> 00:25:27,822
A very simple place.

203
00:25:28,239 --> 00:25:31,159
Pink stones that warm in the sun.

204
00:25:31,242 --> 00:25:34,746
A kitchen garden
that smells of herbs in the day,

205
00:25:35,538 --> 00:25:37,415
jasmine in the evening.

206
00:25:39,083 --> 00:25:41,669
Through the gate is a giant poplar.

207
00:25:41,961 --> 00:25:44,797
Figs, apples, pears.

208
00:25:44,881 --> 00:25:48,718
The soil, Marcus, black.
Black like my wife's hair.

209
00:25:49,761 --> 00:25:51,930
Grapes on the south slopes,
olives on the north.

210
00:25:52,013 --> 00:25:54,265
Wild ponies play near my house.
They tease my son.

211
00:25:54,349 --> 00:25:55,975
He wants to be one of them.

212
00:25:56,059 --> 00:25:57,852
When was the last time
you were home?

213
00:25:57,936 --> 00:26:01,064
Two years, 264 days and this morning.

214
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:05,985
I envy you, Maximus. It's a good home.

215
00:26:07,695 --> 00:26:09,405
Worth fighting for.

216
00:26:12,241 --> 00:26:14,369
There is one more duty

217
00:26:14,911 --> 00:26:17,664
that I ask of you before you go home.

218
00:26:19,582 --> 00:26:21,709
What would you have me do, Caesar?

219
00:26:21,793 --> 00:26:25,421
I want you to become
the protector of Rome after I die.

220
00:26:26,589 --> 00:26:29,592
I will empower you to one end alone,

221
00:26:30,134 --> 00:26:33,596
to give power back
to the people of Rome,

222
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:37,016
and end the corruption
that has crippled it.

223
00:26:43,272 --> 00:26:46,943
Will you accept this great honor
that I have offered you?

224
00:26:48,277 --> 00:26:50,238
With all my heart, no.

225
00:26:52,782 --> 00:26:54,534
Maximus,

226
00:26:55,118 --> 00:26:58,037
that is why it must be you.

227
00:26:58,121 --> 00:27:00,206
But surely a prefect, a senator,

228
00:27:00,289 --> 00:27:03,001
somebody who knows the city,
who understands her politics.

229
00:27:03,084 --> 00:27:06,045
But you have not been corrupted
by her politics.

230
00:27:11,092 --> 00:27:14,679
-And Commodus?
-Commodus is not a moral man.

231
00:27:15,638 --> 00:27:18,266
You have known that
since you were young.

232
00:27:18,349 --> 00:27:20,309
Commodus cannot rule.

233
00:27:20,393 --> 00:27:22,770
He must not rule.

234
00:27:24,313 --> 00:27:27,108
You are the son that I should have had.

235
00:27:29,652 --> 00:27:32,655
Commodus will accept my decision.

236
00:27:34,949 --> 00:27:39,704
He knows that you command
the loyalty of the army.

237
00:27:44,584 --> 00:27:46,169
I need some time, sire.

238
00:27:46,252 --> 00:27:47,712
Yes.

239
00:27:47,795 --> 00:27:51,340
By sunset, I hope you will have agreed.

240
00:27:52,425 --> 00:27:54,594
Now embrace me as my son.

241
00:27:58,014 --> 00:28:00,725
And bring an old man another blanket.

242
00:28:16,991 --> 00:28:19,452
-My father favors you now.
-My lady.

243
00:28:20,036 --> 00:28:23,039
-It was not always so.
-Many things change.

244
00:28:23,331 --> 00:28:26,542
Many things. Not everything.

245
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:31,089
Maximus, stop.

246
00:28:34,634 --> 00:28:36,552
Let me see your face.

247
00:28:39,138 --> 00:28:41,808
-You seem upset.
-I lost many men.

248
00:28:42,725 --> 00:28:45,061
What did my father want with you?

249
00:28:46,145 --> 00:28:49,107
To wish me well before I leave for home.

250
00:28:49,732 --> 00:28:51,234
You're lying.

251
00:28:51,567 --> 00:28:54,904
I could always tell when you were lying,
because you were never any good at it.

252
00:28:54,987 --> 00:28:56,489
I never acquired your comfort with it.

253
00:28:56,572 --> 00:28:57,615
True.

254
00:28:57,698 --> 00:28:59,784
But then you never had to.

255
00:29:00,284 --> 00:29:02,995
Life is more simple for a soldier.

256
00:29:04,747 --> 00:29:06,999
Or do you think me heartless?

257
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,753
I think you have a talent for survival.

258
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:18,302
Maximus, stop.

259
00:29:20,596 --> 00:29:23,391
Is it really so terrible seeing me again?

260
00:29:23,474 --> 00:29:25,977
No. I'm tired from battle.

261
00:29:26,602 --> 00:29:29,397
It hurts you to see my father so fragile.

262
00:29:32,525 --> 00:29:36,946
Commodus expects that my father will
announce his succession within days.

263
00:29:38,114 --> 00:29:41,492
Will you serve my brother
as you served his father?

264
00:29:43,661 --> 00:29:45,830
I will always serve Rome.

265
00:29:47,748 --> 00:29:49,542
Do you know,

266
00:29:49,625 --> 00:29:52,128
I still remember you in my prayers.

267
00:29:53,171 --> 00:29:56,090
Oh, yes. I pray.

268
00:30:00,636 --> 00:30:03,973
I was sad to hear of your husband's
death. I mourned him.

269
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:08,686
-Thank you.
-And I hear you have a son.

270
00:30:10,354 --> 00:30:12,773
Yes. Lucius.

271
00:30:14,567 --> 00:30:16,360
He'll be nearly eight years old.

272
00:30:16,444 --> 00:30:18,696
My son is also nearly eight.

273
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:23,659
I thank you for your prayers.

274
00:30:31,417 --> 00:30:33,961
Ancestors, I ask for your guidance.

275
00:30:35,338 --> 00:30:38,841
Blessed Mother, come to me
with the gods' desire for my future.

276
00:30:40,468 --> 00:30:44,263
Blessed Father, watch over my wife
and son with a ready sword.

277
00:30:45,473 --> 00:30:48,351
Whisper to them,
I live only to hold them again.

278
00:30:49,477 --> 00:30:51,687
<i>Ancestors, I honor you,</i>

279
00:30:52,855 --> 00:30:56,150
and will try to live
with the dignity you have taught me.

280
00:31:19,048 --> 00:31:20,258
Cicero.

281
00:31:24,845 --> 00:31:25,972
Sir.

282
00:31:30,434 --> 00:31:32,979
Do you ever find it hard to do your duty?

283
00:31:35,731 --> 00:31:38,276
Sometimes I do what I want to do.

284
00:31:39,026 --> 00:31:41,570
The rest of the time, I do what I have to.

285
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:47,410
We may not be able to go home,
after all.

286
00:32:17,231 --> 00:32:20,026
Are you ready to do your duty for Rome?

287
00:32:23,195 --> 00:32:24,613
Yes, Father.

288
00:32:25,698 --> 00:32:27,783
You will not be emperor.

289
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,456
Which wiser, older man
is to take my place?

290
00:32:33,539 --> 00:32:36,083
My powers will pass to Maximus,

291
00:32:37,293 --> 00:32:39,045
to hold in trust,

292
00:32:39,128 --> 00:32:42,840
until the Senate is ready to rule
once more.

293
00:32:44,425 --> 00:32:47,845
Rome is to be a republic again.

294
00:32:49,805 --> 00:32:52,391
-Maximus.
-Yes.

295
00:32:58,481 --> 00:33:00,733
My decision disappoints you?

296
00:33:04,278 --> 00:33:06,322
You wrote to me once,

297
00:33:08,199 --> 00:33:10,618
listing the four chief virtues.

298
00:33:12,369 --> 00:33:13,746
Wisdom,

299
00:33:13,829 --> 00:33:15,289
justice,

300
00:33:15,372 --> 00:33:16,832
fortitude,

301
00:33:17,249 --> 00:33:19,043
and temperance.

302
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:24,340
As I read the list,
I knew I had none of them.

303
00:33:25,299 --> 00:33:27,760
But I have other virtues, Father.

304
00:33:28,969 --> 00:33:30,304
Ambition.

305
00:33:31,514 --> 00:33:34,517
That can be a virtue
when it drives us to excel.

306
00:33:35,851 --> 00:33:38,938
Resourcefulness, courage.

307
00:33:40,022 --> 00:33:44,318
Perhaps not on the battlefield,
but there are many forms of courage.

308
00:33:45,945 --> 00:33:49,198
Devotion to my family,

309
00:33:50,324 --> 00:33:51,700
to you.

310
00:33:53,202 --> 00:33:55,996
But none of my virtues were on your list.

311
00:33:58,249 --> 00:34:01,585
Even then it was as if
you didn't want me for your son.

312
00:34:01,669 --> 00:34:03,045
Com mod us,

313
00:34:03,921 --> 00:34:05,589
you go too far.

314
00:34:06,382 --> 00:34:09,385
I searched the faces of the gods

315
00:34:10,136 --> 00:34:14,515
for ways to please you,
to make you proud.

316
00:34:15,391 --> 00:34:17,393
One kind word,

317
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:19,728
one full hug,

318
00:34:19,895 --> 00:34:23,566
where you pressed me to your chest
and held me tight,

319
00:34:24,733 --> 00:34:28,237
would have been like the sun
on my heart for 1,000 years.

320
00:34:30,906 --> 00:34:33,492
What is it in me you hate so much?

321
00:34:33,576 --> 00:34:34,785
Com mod us.

322
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:37,955
All I've ever wanted

323
00:34:38,247 --> 00:34:42,501
was to live up to you, Caesar.

324
00:34:43,752 --> 00:34:46,422
—Father.
—Com mod us,

325
00:34:50,843 --> 00:34:52,928
your faults as a son

326
00:34:53,929 --> 00:34:57,266
is my failure as a father.

327
00:35:07,943 --> 00:35:09,445
Come.

328
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:14,450
Father.

329
00:35:29,381 --> 00:35:32,092
I would butcher the whole world,

330
00:35:32,968 --> 00:35:35,471
if you would only have loved me!

331
00:36:13,133 --> 00:36:16,220
Maximus, the Emperor needs you.
It's urgent.

332
00:36:21,684 --> 00:36:23,519
Lament with me, brother.

333
00:36:24,603 --> 00:36:26,563
Our great father is dead.

334
00:36:53,299 --> 00:36:54,883
How did he die?

335
00:36:56,176 --> 00:36:58,846
The surgeons say there was no pain.

336
00:36:58,929 --> 00:37:01,056
His breath gave out as he slept.

337
00:37:10,816 --> 00:37:12,067
Father.

338
00:37:14,737 --> 00:37:17,406
Your emperor asks for your loyalty,
Maximus.

339
00:37:18,741 --> 00:37:20,367
Take my hand.

340
00:37:23,078 --> 00:37:24,913
I only offer it once.

341
00:37:39,094 --> 00:37:40,429
Quintus.

342
00:38:30,646 --> 00:38:32,147
Hail, Caesar.

343
00:38:33,107 --> 00:38:35,734
I must talk to the senators.
I need their counsel.

344
00:38:35,818 --> 00:38:38,404
-Wake Gaius and Falco.
-Gaius and Falco.

345
00:38:38,487 --> 00:38:40,697
<i>Sword.
Sword.</i>

346
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,120
Maximus, please be careful.
That was not prudent.

347
00:38:46,203 --> 00:38:48,997
Prudent? The Emperor has been slain.

348
00:38:49,456 --> 00:38:51,959
The emperor died of natural causes.

349
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:55,963
-Why are you armed, Quintus?
-Guards!

350
00:38:59,174 --> 00:39:01,343
Please don't fight, Maximus.

351
00:39:03,095 --> 00:39:05,389
I'm sorry. Caesar has spoken.

352
00:39:05,848 --> 00:39:07,641
Ride until dawn,

353
00:39:08,851 --> 00:39:10,436
and then execute him.

354
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:12,938
Quintus, look at me. Look at me!

355
00:39:13,188 --> 00:39:16,108
Promise me
that you will look after my family.

356
00:39:17,192 --> 00:39:19,862
Your family will meet you in the afterlife.

357
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,971
Kneel.

358
00:39:49,516 --> 00:39:51,894
<i>Blessed Father,
watch over my wife and son.</i>

359
00:39:51,977 --> 00:39:55,063
<i>Whisper to them
that I live only to hold them again.</i>

360
00:39:57,691 --> 00:40:00,068
At least give me a clean death.

361
00:40:01,778 --> 00:40:03,572
A soldier's death.

362
00:40:24,885 --> 00:40:28,055
The frost,
sometimes it makes the blade stick.

363
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,118
Praetorian!

364
00:42:09,865 --> 00:42:11,783
<i>When was the last time
you were home?</i>

365
00:42:11,867 --> 00:42:14,870
<i>Two years, 264 days and this morning.</i>

366
00:42:16,455 --> 00:42:18,290
<i>Blessed Father, watch over my wife
and son with a ready sword.</i>

367
00:42:18,373 --> 00:42:20,751
<i>I will try to live
with the dignity you have taught me.</i>

368
00:42:20,834 --> 00:42:23,295
<i>Whisper to them,
I live only to hold them again.</i>

369
00:42:23,378 --> 00:42:25,797
<i>...with a ready sword,
for all else is dust and air.</i>

370
00:42:25,881 --> 00:42:29,051
<i>Whisper to them,
I live only to hold them again.</i>

371
00:42:29,134 --> 00:42:31,428
<i>For all else is dust and air.</i>

372
00:43:31,697 --> 00:43:33,699
Papa!

373
00:46:17,779 --> 00:46:19,281
Don't die.

374
00:46:25,579 --> 00:46:27,247
<i>You'll meet them again.</i>

375
00:46:29,291 --> 00:46:30,584
<i>Not yet.</i>

376
00:46:39,134 --> 00:46:42,888
No. They will clean it. Wait and see.

377
00:47:17,297 --> 00:47:18,673
Don't die.

378
00:47:19,466 --> 00:47:21,885
They'll feed you to the lions.

379
00:47:21,968 --> 00:47:24,262
They are worth more than we are.

380
00:47:34,272 --> 00:47:35,732
Better now?

381
00:47:36,858 --> 00:47:38,735
Clean. You see?

382
00:48:09,474 --> 00:48:12,310
Proximo! My old friend.

383
00:48:13,687 --> 00:48:16,773
Every day is a great day
when you are here,

384
00:48:17,232 --> 00:48:21,403
but today is your most fortunate day.

385
00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:27,742
Those giraffes you sold me,
they won't mate.

386
00:48:28,368 --> 00:48:32,288
They just walk around eating
and not mating.

387
00:48:33,581 --> 00:48:36,501
You sold me queer giraffes.

388
00:48:37,377 --> 00:48:40,088
-I want my money back.
-Not a chance.

389
00:48:43,675 --> 00:48:46,511
-I do special price for you.
-On what?

390
00:48:48,596 --> 00:48:51,516
Have you seen my new stock?
Come and see them.

391
00:49:05,447 --> 00:49:08,241
Do any of them fight?
I've got a match coming up.

392
00:49:08,324 --> 00:49:11,119
Some are good for fighting,
others for dying.

393
00:49:11,202 --> 00:49:13,538
You need both, I think.

394
00:49:13,621 --> 00:49:14,831
Get up.

395
00:49:22,797 --> 00:49:24,466
What's your trade?

396
00:49:25,133 --> 00:49:26,426
I was a hunter.

397
00:49:26,509 --> 00:49:30,221
No, I bought him from a salt mine
in Carthage.

398
00:49:31,014 --> 00:49:32,390
Sit down.

399
00:49:36,519 --> 00:49:37,604
Mark of the legion.

400
00:49:38,772 --> 00:49:41,524
-Deserter.
-Maybe so, but who cares?

401
00:49:41,983 --> 00:49:43,109
He's a Spaniard.

402
00:49:43,193 --> 00:49:45,153
I'll take six. For 1,000.

403
00:49:45,236 --> 00:49:48,740
1,000?
The Numidian alone is worth 2,000.

404
00:49:48,823 --> 00:49:50,909
These slaves are rotten.

405
00:49:50,992 --> 00:49:54,162
It all adds to the flavor.
No, no, no, wait! Wait!

406
00:49:54,662 --> 00:49:56,372
I can negotiate.

407
00:49:57,499 --> 00:50:01,669
I'll give you 2,000,
and 4,000 for the beasts.

408
00:50:01,753 --> 00:50:03,880
That's 5,000 for an old friend.

409
00:50:21,523 --> 00:50:24,943
Come on! How long does it take
to get into my own house?

410
00:50:25,026 --> 00:50:26,945
I am Proximo.

411
00:50:27,654 --> 00:50:30,198
I shall be closer to you
for the next few days,

412
00:50:30,281 --> 00:50:32,492
which will be the last
of your miserable lives,

413
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:36,913
than that bitch of a mother that
brought you screaming into this world.

414
00:50:37,205 --> 00:50:40,542
I did not pay good money for you
for your company.

415
00:50:41,751 --> 00:50:44,963
I paid it so that I could profit
from your death.

416
00:50:45,713 --> 00:50:49,467
And as your mother was there
at your beginning,

417
00:50:50,468 --> 00:50:53,054
so I shall be there at your end.

418
00:50:54,556 --> 00:50:57,600
And when you die, and die you shall,

419
00:50:58,518 --> 00:51:01,437
your transition shall be to the sound of...

420
00:51:06,151 --> 00:51:07,610
Gladiators,

421
00:51:08,736 --> 00:51:10,280
I salute you.

422
00:51:15,034 --> 00:51:16,077
Red.

423
00:51:19,747 --> 00:51:21,082
Yellow.

424
00:51:22,208 --> 00:51:23,501
Yellow.

425
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:35,346
Good.

426
00:51:36,139 --> 00:51:37,515
-Red.
-Red.

427
00:51:42,437 --> 00:51:43,730
Spaniard.

428
00:52:17,096 --> 00:52:19,432
That's enough for the moment!

429
00:52:19,766 --> 00:52:21,392
His time will come.

430
00:52:24,437 --> 00:52:25,480
Next.

431
00:52:39,244 --> 00:52:40,578
Spaniard,

432
00:52:40,870 --> 00:52:42,664
why don't you fight?

433
00:52:43,248 --> 00:52:45,083
We all have to fight.

434
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:01,391
Is that the sign of your gods?

435
00:53:06,604 --> 00:53:08,690
Will that not anger them?

436
00:53:30,003 --> 00:53:31,671
The gods favor you.

437
00:53:32,046 --> 00:53:34,215
Red is the gods' color.

438
00:53:35,591 --> 00:53:37,760
You will need their help today.

439
00:53:55,611 --> 00:53:58,656
Some of you are thinking you won't fight,

440
00:53:59,949 --> 00:54:01,159
some that you can't fight.

441
00:54:02,493 --> 00:54:05,997
They all say that until they're out there.

442
00:54:08,791 --> 00:54:09,959
Listen.

443
00:54:10,043 --> 00:54:12,962
-Kill! Kill! Kill!
-Kill! Kill! Kill!

444
00:54:20,094 --> 00:54:22,805
Thrust this into another man's flesh,

445
00:54:23,222 --> 00:54:25,892
and they will applaud and love you
for that.

446
00:54:25,975 --> 00:54:27,393
And you,

447
00:54:29,353 --> 00:54:31,314
you may begin to love them

448
00:54:32,148 --> 00:54:33,566
for that.

449
00:54:37,653 --> 00:54:41,157
Ultimately, we're all dead men.

450
00:54:43,701 --> 00:54:45,995
Sadly, we cannot choose how,

451
00:54:47,246 --> 00:54:50,041
but we can decide
how we meet that end,

452
00:54:50,958 --> 00:54:53,461
in order that we are remembered

453
00:54:55,379 --> 00:54:56,631
as men.

454
00:54:56,714 --> 00:54:57,757
Come on!

455
00:55:00,718 --> 00:55:03,012
On the left, draw your shields!

456
00:55:04,055 --> 00:55:06,432
On the right, draw your swords!

457
00:55:06,724 --> 00:55:09,268
-Kill! Kill! Kill!
-Kill! Kill! Kill!

458
00:55:10,394 --> 00:55:12,814
Pair them up, red with yellow.

459
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:19,070
Next!

460
00:55:24,951 --> 00:55:26,035
Move!

461
00:58:43,399 --> 00:58:44,442
Usurper!

462
00:59:07,089 --> 00:59:09,800
-Go away!
-You'll never rule us, Commodus!

463
00:59:40,206 --> 00:59:44,919
He enters Rome like a conquering
hero. But what has he conquered?

464
00:59:45,211 --> 00:59:47,630
Give him time, Gracchus. He's young.

465
00:59:47,713 --> 00:59:50,007
I think he could do very well.

466
00:59:50,341 --> 00:59:52,301
For Rome, or for you?

467
00:59:58,599 --> 01:00:01,685
Go to your mother, Lucius.
It's what she'd like.

468
01:00:08,150 --> 01:00:10,194
-Lucius!
-Mother!

469
01:00:12,488 --> 01:00:14,031
Hail, Caesar.

470
01:00:14,115 --> 01:00:15,616
Senators.

471
01:00:19,245 --> 01:00:22,164
Rome greets her new emperor.

472
01:00:22,248 --> 01:00:25,793
Your loyal subjects bid you welcome,
Highness.

473
01:00:25,876 --> 01:00:27,711
Thank you, Falco.

474
01:00:27,795 --> 01:00:31,882
And for the loyal subjects,
I trust they weren't too expensive.

475
01:00:31,966 --> 01:00:33,968
-Caesar.
-Gracchus.

476
01:00:34,051 --> 01:00:36,554
All Rome rejoices in your return,
Caesar.

477
01:00:36,637 --> 01:00:40,141
But there are many matters
that require your attention.

478
01:00:42,601 --> 01:00:45,479
To order, please. To order.

479
01:00:45,938 --> 01:00:47,731
For your guidance, Caesar,

480
01:00:47,815 --> 01:00:50,609
the Senate has prepared
a series of protocols

481
01:00:50,693 --> 01:00:53,779
to begin addressing
the many problems in the city,

482
01:00:53,863 --> 01:00:57,950
beginning with basic sanitation
for the Greek Quarter,

483
01:00:58,451 --> 01:01:02,079
to combat the plague
which is already springing up there.

484
01:01:02,163 --> 01:01:03,956
So, if Caesar...

485
01:01:06,083 --> 01:01:08,002
Don't you see, Gracchus?

486
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:11,714
That's the very problem, isn't it?

487
01:01:12,131 --> 01:01:14,800
My father spent all his time at study,

488
01:01:16,552 --> 01:01:19,930
at books of learning and philosophy.

489
01:01:20,931 --> 01:01:24,435
He spent his twilight hours
reading scrolls from the Senate.

490
01:01:25,394 --> 01:01:28,606
And all the while,
the people were forgotten.

491
01:01:29,231 --> 01:01:31,400
But the senate is the people, sire,

492
01:01:31,484 --> 01:01:35,029
chosen from among the people
to speak for the people.

493
01:01:35,738 --> 01:01:39,325
I doubt many of the people
eat so well as you do, Gracchus.

494
01:01:40,075 --> 01:01:42,536
Or have such splendid mistresses,
Gaius.

495
01:01:42,620 --> 01:01:44,705
I think I understand my own people.

496
01:01:44,788 --> 01:01:48,292
Then perhaps Caesar will be so good
as to teach us,

497
01:01:48,709 --> 01:01:51,337
out of his own extensive experience.

498
01:01:55,216 --> 01:01:56,759
I call it love.

499
01:01:57,343 --> 01:02:00,471
I am their father.
The people are my children.

500
01:02:00,763 --> 01:02:03,265
And I shall hold them to my bosom
and embrace them tightly.

501
01:02:03,349 --> 01:02:06,810
Have you ever embraced
someone dying of plague, sire?

502
01:02:13,108 --> 01:02:15,736
No, but if you interrupt me again,

503
01:02:17,238 --> 01:02:18,572
I assure you that you shall.

504
01:02:18,656 --> 01:02:20,991
Senator, my brother is very tired.

505
01:02:21,992 --> 01:02:26,163
Leave your list with me.
Caesar shall do all that Rome requires.

506
01:02:26,747 --> 01:02:31,669
My lady, as always, your lightest
touch commands obedience.

507
01:02:38,801 --> 01:02:41,053
Who are they to lecture me?

508
01:02:41,345 --> 01:02:43,889
Commodus, the Senate has its uses.

509
01:02:43,973 --> 01:02:46,850
What uses? All they do is talk.

510
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:52,606
It should be just you and me and Rome.

511
01:02:52,690 --> 01:02:56,026
Don't even think it.
There's always been a Senate.

512
01:02:56,527 --> 01:02:58,195
Rome has changed.

513
01:02:58,279 --> 01:03:01,323
It takes an emperor to rule an empire.

514
01:03:01,657 --> 01:03:03,701
Of course, but leave the people their...

515
01:03:03,784 --> 01:03:05,160
Illusions?

516
01:03:06,787 --> 01:03:08,205
Traditions.

517
01:03:09,081 --> 01:03:11,875
My father's war against the barbarians.

518
01:03:12,459 --> 01:03:16,130
He said it himself, it achieved nothing.
But the people loved him.

519
01:03:16,213 --> 01:03:18,090
The people always love victories.

520
01:03:18,173 --> 01:03:21,844
Why? They didn't see the battles.

521
01:03:23,178 --> 01:03:25,139
What do they care about Germania?

522
01:03:25,222 --> 01:03:27,558
They care about the greatness of Rome.

523
01:03:27,641 --> 01:03:29,560
"The greatness of Rome."

524
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:33,314
Well, What is that?

525
01:03:36,025 --> 01:03:39,236
It's an idea. Greatness.

526
01:03:42,990 --> 01:03:46,410
Greatness is a vision.
-Exactly. A vision.

527
01:03:48,537 --> 01:03:50,456
Do you not see, Lucilia?

528
01:03:51,832 --> 01:03:55,794
I will give the people a vision
of Rome, and they'll love me for it.

529
01:03:56,420 --> 01:04:00,841
And they'll soon forget the tedious
sermonizing of a few dry old men.

530
01:04:12,227 --> 01:04:15,564
I will give the people
the greatest vision of their lives.

531
01:05:06,782 --> 01:05:09,702
White and red wine
for your drinking pleasure!

532
01:05:18,001 --> 01:05:19,169
Games.

533
01:05:21,463 --> 01:05:24,508
One hundred and fifty days of games.

534
01:05:25,008 --> 01:05:26,552
He's cleverer than I thought.

535
01:05:26,635 --> 01:05:30,180
Clever. The whole of Rome
would be laughing at him,

536
01:05:31,014 --> 01:05:33,267
if they weren't so afraid
of his Praetorians.

537
01:05:33,350 --> 01:05:36,145
Fear and wonder.
A powerful combination.

538
01:05:37,563 --> 01:05:40,691
You really think the people
are going to be seduced by that?

539
01:05:40,774 --> 01:05:43,861
I think he knows what Rome is.
Rome is the mob.

540
01:05:44,528 --> 01:05:47,698
Conjure magic for them,
and they'll be distracted.

541
01:05:48,282 --> 01:05:51,535
Take away their freedom,
and still they'll roar.

542
01:05:52,077 --> 01:05:56,457
The beating heart of Rome
is not the marble of the Senate.

543
01:05:56,540 --> 01:05:58,542
It's the sand of the Colosseum.

544
01:06:00,544 --> 01:06:02,588
He'll bring them death,

545
01:06:04,339 --> 01:06:06,717
and they will love him for it.

546
01:06:28,697 --> 01:06:30,032
Spaniard.

547
01:06:31,241 --> 01:06:32,910
-Spaniard.
-Spaniard.

548
01:06:33,619 --> 01:06:34,912
Spaniard.

549
01:07:44,439 --> 01:07:48,569
Are you not entertained?
Are you not entertained?

550
01:07:50,862 --> 01:07:53,115
Is this not why you're here?

551
01:07:57,744 --> 01:08:00,747
Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard!

552
01:08:01,331 --> 01:08:05,210
-Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard!
-Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard!

553
01:08:18,015 --> 01:08:19,766
What do you want?

554
01:08:22,311 --> 01:08:23,478
Girl?

555
01:08:24,521 --> 01:08:25,689
Boy?

556
01:08:26,607 --> 01:08:28,859
-You sent for me.
-Yes, I did.

557
01:08:29,943 --> 01:08:33,030
You're good, Spaniard,
but you're not that good.

558
01:08:33,113 --> 01:08:34,281
You could be magnificent.

559
01:08:34,364 --> 01:08:37,868
I'm required to kill, so I kill.
That is enough.

560
01:08:38,702 --> 01:08:41,788
That's enough for the provinces,
but not for Rome.

561
01:08:45,167 --> 01:08:49,087
The young emperor has arranged
a series of spectacles

562
01:08:49,171 --> 01:08:53,342
to commemorate his father,
Marcus Aurelius.

563
01:08:53,884 --> 01:08:55,844
I find that amusing,

564
01:08:56,178 --> 01:08:59,264
since it was Marcus Aurelius, the wise,

565
01:08:59,348 --> 01:09:02,809
the all-knowing Marcus Aurelius,
that closed us down.

566
01:09:05,812 --> 01:09:09,941
So finally, after five years
of scratching a living

567
01:09:10,025 --> 01:09:12,235
in flea-infested villages,

568
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:15,364
we're finally going back
to where we belong.

569
01:09:16,073 --> 01:09:17,658
The Colosseum.

570
01:09:19,910 --> 01:09:22,704
You should see the Colosseum,
Spaniard.

571
01:09:24,039 --> 01:09:26,083
Fifty thousand Romans,

572
01:09:27,042 --> 01:09:30,879
watching every movement
of your sword,

573
01:09:32,297 --> 01:09:34,800
willing you to make that killer blow.

574
01:09:35,967 --> 01:09:39,596
The silence before you strike
and the noise afterwards.

575
01:09:40,597 --> 01:09:44,226
It rises. It rises up,

576
01:09:45,435 --> 01:09:47,062
like a storm.

577
01:09:47,854 --> 01:09:50,524
As if you were the thunder god himself.

578
01:09:50,607 --> 01:09:53,568
-You were a gladiator?
-Yes, I was.

579
01:09:59,991 --> 01:10:02,202
You won your freedom?

580
01:10:02,285 --> 01:10:04,621
A long time ago, the Emperor

581
01:10:06,289 --> 01:10:08,375
presented me with a rudius.

582
01:10:08,458 --> 01:10:11,169
It's just a wooden sword.

583
01:10:12,879 --> 01:10:15,132
The symbol of your freedom.

584
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:20,303
He touched me on the shoulder,
and I was free.

585
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:24,099
You knew Marcus Aurelius?

586
01:10:24,182 --> 01:10:28,437
I did not say I knew him. I said
he touched me on the shoulder once.

587
01:10:29,062 --> 01:10:31,148
You asked me what I want.

588
01:10:32,482 --> 01:10:35,444
I, too, want to stand
in front of the Emperor,

589
01:10:36,695 --> 01:10:38,113
as you did.

590
01:10:38,196 --> 01:10:41,616
Then listen to me. Learn from me.

591
01:10:42,492 --> 01:10:45,537
I wasn't the best because I killed quickly.

592
01:10:46,747 --> 01:10:49,416
I was the best
because the crowd loved me.

593
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:53,837
Win the crowd,
and you'll win your freedom.

594
01:10:58,300 --> 01:11:00,177
I will win the crowd.

595
01:11:02,387 --> 01:11:05,849
I will give them something
they've never seen before.

596
01:11:06,850 --> 01:11:09,853
So, Spaniard,
we shall go to Rome together

597
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:12,355
and have bloody adventures.

598
01:11:12,439 --> 01:11:14,232
And the great whore will suckle us

599
01:11:14,316 --> 01:11:16,902
until we are fat and happy
and can suckle no more.

600
01:11:16,985 --> 01:11:18,445
And then,

601
01:11:19,529 --> 01:11:21,698
when enough men have died,

602
01:11:23,867 --> 01:11:26,328
perhaps you will have your freedom.

603
01:11:30,749 --> 01:11:33,084
Here. Use this.

604
01:11:56,817 --> 01:11:59,986
It's somewhere out there, my country.

605
01:12:01,071 --> 01:12:02,405
My home.

606
01:12:03,573 --> 01:12:05,742
My wife is preparing food.

607
01:12:06,701 --> 01:12:09,412
My daughters carry water from the river.

608
01:12:10,747 --> 01:12:12,791
Will I ever see them again?

609
01:12:14,084 --> 01:12:15,585
I think, no.

610
01:12:15,877 --> 01:12:18,338
Do you believe you'll see them again
when you die?

611
01:12:18,421 --> 01:12:19,798
I think so.

612
01:12:20,423 --> 01:12:23,510
But then, I will die soon.

613
01:12:25,136 --> 01:12:27,597
They will not die for many years.

614
01:12:28,390 --> 01:12:30,058
I'll have to wait.

615
01:12:30,141 --> 01:12:32,310
But you would? Wait?

616
01:12:32,936 --> 01:12:34,312
Of course.

617
01:12:36,231 --> 01:12:37,607
You see,

618
01:12:38,775 --> 01:12:42,320
my wife and my son

619
01:12:44,030 --> 01:12:46,199
are already waiting for me.

620
01:12:46,283 --> 01:12:49,953
You'll meet them again. But not yet.

621
01:12:53,999 --> 01:12:55,375
Not yet.

622
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:58,670
-Unless...
-Not yet.

623
01:13:02,674 --> 01:13:03,967
Not yet.

624
01:13:16,855 --> 01:13:18,398
There he is.

625
01:14:07,530 --> 01:14:08,657
Out.

626
01:14:09,866 --> 01:14:11,785
Move, go, out!

627
01:14:24,506 --> 01:14:27,008
Good to see you again, old friend.

628
01:14:32,347 --> 01:14:34,057
Bring me fortune.

629
01:14:38,645 --> 01:14:41,523
Have you ever seen anything
like that before?

630
01:14:42,607 --> 01:14:45,193
I didn't know men
could build such things.

631
01:14:55,161 --> 01:14:56,746
Win the crowd.

632
01:14:56,955 --> 01:14:59,290
Get inside. Move.

633
01:14:59,374 --> 01:15:00,667
Inside.

634
01:15:49,883 --> 01:15:52,635
He sleeps so well because he's loved.

635
01:15:55,555 --> 01:15:57,640
Come, brother. It's late.

636
01:16:01,227 --> 01:16:04,064
I will make Rome
the wonder of the ages.

637
01:16:06,858 --> 01:16:10,195
That is what Gracchus
and his friends don't understand.

638
01:16:10,612 --> 01:16:13,823
All my desires
are splitting my head to pieces.

639
01:16:20,872 --> 01:16:23,625
Commodus, drink this tonic.

640
01:16:33,176 --> 01:16:35,637
I think the time is almost right.

641
01:16:36,012 --> 01:16:38,932
I could announce
the dissolution of the Senate

642
01:16:39,015 --> 01:16:41,101
at the celebration to honor our father.

643
01:16:41,184 --> 01:16:43,144
Do you think I should?

644
01:16:43,895 --> 01:16:45,814
Are the people ready?

645
01:16:47,941 --> 01:16:50,318
I think you need your rest now.

646
01:16:56,241 --> 01:16:58,076
Will you stay with me?

647
01:16:58,159 --> 01:17:00,578
Still afraid of the dark, brother?

648
01:17:07,335 --> 01:17:08,545
Still.

649
01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:11,673
Always.

650
01:17:13,383 --> 01:17:16,261
-Stay with me tonight.
-You know I won't.

651
01:17:20,723 --> 01:17:22,267
Then kiss me.

652
01:17:31,067 --> 01:17:32,610
Sleep, brother.

653
01:17:51,379 --> 01:17:52,547
Come on!

654
01:18:01,389 --> 01:18:03,433
All right, that's enough.

655
01:18:25,997 --> 01:18:27,332
The Emperor wants battles,

656
01:18:27,415 --> 01:18:29,584
and I don't want to sacrifice
my best fighters.

657
01:18:29,667 --> 01:18:33,004
The crowd wants battles,
so the Emperor gives them battles.

658
01:18:33,087 --> 01:18:36,674
-You get the battle of Carthage.
-Massacre of Carthage.

659
01:18:38,635 --> 01:18:40,053
Well, why don't you go down
to the prison,

660
01:18:40,136 --> 01:18:42,138
round up all the beggars and thieves?

661
01:18:42,222 --> 01:18:43,389
We've done that.

662
01:18:43,473 --> 01:18:45,850
If you want to give away
the best gladiators

663
01:18:45,934 --> 01:18:47,101
in the whole of the empire,

664
01:18:47,185 --> 01:18:49,312
then I want double the rates.

665
01:18:49,395 --> 01:18:53,191
You'll get your contract rates,
or you'll get your contract canceled.

666
01:18:53,274 --> 01:18:54,692
You don't like it?

667
01:18:54,776 --> 01:18:58,738
Then you can crawl back down
that shit hole that you came from.

668
01:19:01,824 --> 01:19:03,993
Cassius, please. You can free us.

669
01:19:33,815 --> 01:19:36,943
Gladiator, are you the one
they call the Spaniard?

670
01:19:37,026 --> 01:19:38,152
Yes.

671
01:19:38,945 --> 01:19:41,155
They said you were a giant.

672
01:19:41,239 --> 01:19:44,409
They said you could crush
a man's skull with one hand.

673
01:19:44,492 --> 01:19:46,244
A man's? No.

674
01:19:47,578 --> 01:19:48,913
A boy's.

675
01:19:50,915 --> 01:19:54,460
-Do they have good horses in Spain?
-Some of the best.

676
01:19:55,503 --> 01:19:58,589
This is Argento and this is Scarto.

677
01:20:00,008 --> 01:20:01,801
They were my horses.

678
01:20:02,719 --> 01:20:04,804
They were taken from me.

679
01:20:05,096 --> 01:20:08,391
I like you, Spaniard.
I shall cheer for you.

680
01:20:08,933 --> 01:20:12,270
-They let you watch the games?
-My uncle says it makes me strong.

681
01:20:12,353 --> 01:20:15,648
-And what does your father say?
-My father is dead.

682
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:19,485
Master Lucius, it is time.

683
01:20:20,737 --> 01:20:22,113
I have to go.

684
01:20:22,196 --> 01:20:23,781
Your name is Lucius?

685
01:20:25,908 --> 01:20:28,578
Lucius Verus, after my father.

686
01:20:59,233 --> 01:21:00,943
Lower!

687
01:21:06,074 --> 01:21:08,993
-Claudius!
-Yes?

688
01:21:09,077 --> 01:21:11,496
-More shields!
-All right.

689
01:21:30,598 --> 01:21:35,353
When the Emperor enters,
raise your weapons, salute him,

690
01:21:35,436 --> 01:21:37,480
and then speak together.

691
01:21:38,272 --> 01:21:41,776
Face the Emperor
and don't turn your back on him.

692
01:21:42,860 --> 01:21:45,738
Go, and die with honor.

693
01:22:40,793 --> 01:22:42,879
Hail, mighty Caesar!

694
01:22:46,090 --> 01:22:50,344
-Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!
-Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

695
01:22:53,347 --> 01:22:56,350
-We who are about to die salute you!
-We who are about to die salute you!

696
01:22:58,060 --> 01:22:59,645
On this day

697
01:23:00,354 --> 01:23:03,357
we reach back to hallowed antiquity

698
01:23:04,233 --> 01:23:07,904
to bring you a re-creation
of the second fall

699
01:23:07,987 --> 01:23:10,031
of mighty Carthage!

700
01:23:13,743 --> 01:23:18,164
On the barren plain of Zama

701
01:23:18,789 --> 01:23:21,876
there stood the invincible armies

702
01:23:22,251 --> 01:23:24,879
of the barbarian Hannibal.

703
01:23:25,588 --> 01:23:28,758
Ferocious mercenaries and warriors

704
01:23:28,841 --> 01:23:31,219
from all brute nations,

705
01:23:31,302 --> 01:23:35,598
bent on merciless destruction,

706
01:23:36,474 --> 01:23:37,850
conquest.

707
01:23:38,768 --> 01:23:42,813
Your emperor is pleased to give you

708
01:23:42,897 --> 01:23:45,942
the barbarian horde!

709
01:23:54,283 --> 01:23:56,285
Anyone here been in the army?

710
01:23:56,369 --> 01:23:59,288
Yes. I served with you at Vindobona.

711
01:24:00,248 --> 01:24:01,916
You can help me.

712
01:24:03,209 --> 01:24:05,753
Whatever comes out of these gates,

713
01:24:06,504 --> 01:24:10,299
we've got a better chance
of survival if we work together.

714
01:24:10,383 --> 01:24:12,093
Do you understand?

715
01:24:14,220 --> 01:24:16,264
If we stay together, we survive.

716
01:24:16,347 --> 01:24:19,475
The Emperor is pleased to bring you
the legionnaires

717
01:24:19,559 --> 01:24:23,145
of Scipio Africanus!

718
01:24:33,948 --> 01:24:35,658
To the death!

719
01:24:39,453 --> 01:24:42,039
-Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!
-Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

720
01:24:45,918 --> 01:24:47,461
Stay close.

721
01:24:53,467 --> 01:24:55,344
Come together!

722
01:24:56,637 --> 01:25:00,725
Stay close. Staggered columns!

723
01:25:13,946 --> 01:25:15,990
You don't have a chance.

724
01:25:27,335 --> 01:25:29,879
Lock your shields. Stay as one.

725
01:25:31,380 --> 01:25:32,965
Hold!

726
01:25:35,009 --> 01:25:38,012
Hold! As one!

727
01:25:40,931 --> 01:25:42,266
Well done.

728
01:25:54,153 --> 01:25:57,990
Hold. Down low!

729
01:26:03,788 --> 01:26:04,997
Yes!

730
01:26:17,093 --> 01:26:18,344
Hagen!

731
01:26:42,451 --> 01:26:45,996
This column to the chariot!
This column stay with me!

732
01:26:49,625 --> 01:26:51,001
Quickly!

733
01:26:51,669 --> 01:26:54,422
-Get out there.
-Hurry!

734
01:27:35,629 --> 01:27:36,797
Maximus!

735
01:27:49,018 --> 01:27:51,437
Single column! Single column!

736
01:28:36,732 --> 01:28:38,150
We win!

737
01:28:43,531 --> 01:28:46,033
My history's a little hazy, Cassius,

738
01:28:46,867 --> 01:28:49,787
but shouldn't the barbarians
lose the battle of Carthage?

739
01:28:49,870 --> 01:28:51,622
Yes, sire.

740
01:28:53,541 --> 01:28:54,917
Forgive me, sire.

741
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,711
No, I rather enjoy surprises.

742
01:28:58,504 --> 01:28:59,630
Who is he?

743
01:28:59,713 --> 01:29:02,716
They call him the Spaniard, sire.

744
01:29:05,219 --> 01:29:07,137
I think I'll meet him.

745
01:29:07,221 --> 01:29:08,556
Yes, sire.

746
01:29:10,766 --> 01:29:12,685
Hail to the barbarians!

747
01:29:27,616 --> 01:29:31,036
Forward! Arms at ready!

748
01:29:44,592 --> 01:29:46,260
Drop your weapons.

749
01:29:50,264 --> 01:29:53,225
Gladiator, the Emperor
has asked for you.

750
01:29:53,809 --> 01:29:56,061
I am at the Emperor's service.

751
01:30:22,755 --> 01:30:24,882
Rise. Rise.

752
01:30:34,224 --> 01:30:36,477
Your fame is well deserved, Spaniard.

753
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:39,063
I don't think there's ever been
a gladiator to match you.

754
01:30:39,146 --> 01:30:42,066
As for this young man,
he insists you are Hector reborn.

755
01:30:42,149 --> 01:30:43,734
Or was it Hercules?

756
01:30:45,152 --> 01:30:48,989
Why doesn't the hero reveal himself
and tell us all your real name?

757
01:30:51,033 --> 01:30:52,660
You do have a name.

758
01:30:53,452 --> 01:30:55,329
My name is Gladiator.

759
01:30:58,624 --> 01:31:01,794
How dare you show your back
to me? Slave!

760
01:31:03,170 --> 01:31:06,507
You will remove your helmet
and tell me your name.

761
01:31:18,268 --> 01:31:20,771
My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius,

762
01:31:21,146 --> 01:31:23,107
commander of the armies of the north,

763
01:31:23,190 --> 01:31:25,526
general of the Felix Legions,

764
01:31:25,609 --> 01:31:28,904
loyal servant to the true emperor,
Marcus Aurelius,

765
01:31:30,322 --> 01:31:32,491
father to a murdered son,

766
01:31:32,950 --> 01:31:35,244
husband to a murdered wife,

767
01:31:35,577 --> 01:31:39,331
and I will have my vengeance,
in this life or the next.

768
01:31:46,338 --> 01:31:47,715
Arms!

769
01:32:00,811 --> 01:32:04,148
Live! Live! Live! Live!

770
01:32:04,231 --> 01:32:07,443
-Live! Live! Live! Live!
-Live! Live! Live! Live!

771
01:32:51,445 --> 01:32:54,156
Arms, at rest!

772
01:33:46,667 --> 01:33:51,130
-Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!
-Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

773
01:34:15,737 --> 01:34:17,656
Why is he still alive?

774
01:34:18,866 --> 01:34:20,367
I don't know.

775
01:34:20,909 --> 01:34:22,536
He shouldn't be alive.

776
01:34:23,203 --> 01:34:24,663
It vexes me.

777
01:34:26,290 --> 01:34:28,083
I'm terribly vexed.

778
01:34:39,469 --> 01:34:41,388
I did what I had to do.

779
01:34:42,139 --> 01:34:46,184
If Father had had his way,
the empire would have been torn apart.

780
01:34:46,268 --> 01:34:47,936
You do see that.

781
01:34:48,312 --> 01:34:49,479
Yes.

782
01:34:54,276 --> 01:34:57,487
What did you feel when you saw him?

783
01:34:59,615 --> 01:35:01,241
I felt nothing.

784
01:35:03,201 --> 01:35:05,746
He wounded you deeply, didn't he?

785
01:35:06,788 --> 01:35:08,999
No more than I wounded him.

786
01:35:13,503 --> 01:35:15,797
They lied to me in Germania.

787
01:35:17,424 --> 01:35:19,509
They told me he was dead.

788
01:35:21,511 --> 01:35:24,097
If they lie to me, they don't respect me.

789
01:35:24,181 --> 01:35:27,517
If they don't respect me,
how can they ever love me?

790
01:35:28,852 --> 01:35:31,229
Then you must let the legions know

791
01:35:31,313 --> 01:35:34,399
their treachery will not go unpunished.

792
01:35:35,233 --> 01:35:36,693
Poor sister.

793
01:35:37,110 --> 01:35:39,571
I wouldn't want to be your enemy.

794
01:35:40,781 --> 01:35:42,532
What will you do?

795
01:35:55,504 --> 01:35:56,838
This way.

796
01:36:32,207 --> 01:36:35,669
Rich matrons pay well to be
pleasured by the bravest champions.

797
01:36:35,752 --> 01:36:38,255
I knew your brother
would send assassins.

798
01:36:38,755 --> 01:36:41,383
I didn't realize he would send his best.

799
01:36:43,010 --> 01:36:45,095
Maximus, he doesn't know.

800
01:36:46,054 --> 01:36:49,182
My family was burnt and crucified
while they were still alive.

801
01:36:49,266 --> 01:36:51,810
-I knew nothing...
-Don't lie to me!

802
01:36:58,275 --> 01:37:00,027
I wept for them.

803
01:37:00,110 --> 01:37:03,947
As you wept for your father?
As you wept for your father?

804
01:37:04,031 --> 01:37:07,617
I have been living
in a prison of fear since that day.

805
01:37:08,118 --> 01:37:11,955
To be unable to mourn your father
for fear of your brother.

806
01:37:12,831 --> 01:37:16,043
To live in terror
every moment of every day,

807
01:37:16,126 --> 01:37:18,920
because your son is heir to the throne.

808
01:37:20,797 --> 01:37:22,257
I have wept.

809
01:37:23,592 --> 01:37:26,428
My son was innocent.

810
01:37:27,262 --> 01:37:29,306
So is mine.

811
01:37:31,308 --> 01:37:34,394
Must my son die, too,
before you'll trust me?

812
01:37:35,854 --> 01:37:38,815
What does it matter if I trust you or not?

813
01:37:39,691 --> 01:37:42,736
The gods have spared you.
Don't you understand?

814
01:37:42,819 --> 01:37:46,281
Today I saw a slave become more
powerful than the emperor of Rome.

815
01:37:46,364 --> 01:37:48,158
The gods have spared me?

816
01:37:48,241 --> 01:37:51,703
I am at their mercy,
with the power only to amuse a mob.

817
01:37:51,787 --> 01:37:53,330
That is power.

818
01:37:53,830 --> 01:37:54,956
The mob is Rome.

819
01:37:55,040 --> 01:37:58,668
And while Commodus controls them,
he controls everything.

820
01:37:59,002 --> 01:38:00,545
Listen to me.

821
01:38:01,088 --> 01:38:04,216
My brother has enemies,
most of all in the Senate.

822
01:38:04,299 --> 01:38:06,551
But while the people follow him,

823
01:38:06,635 --> 01:38:09,679
no one would dare stand up to him
until you.

824
01:38:10,639 --> 01:38:12,933
They oppose him, yet they do nothing.

825
01:38:13,016 --> 01:38:16,770
There are some politicians who have
dedicated their lives to Rome.

826
01:38:16,853 --> 01:38:18,605
One man above all.

827
01:38:19,689 --> 01:38:22,776
If I can arrange it, will you meet him?

828
01:38:23,110 --> 01:38:25,028
Do you not understand?

829
01:38:25,278 --> 01:38:29,491
I may die in this cell tonight,
or in the arena tomorrow. I am a slave!

830
01:38:29,574 --> 01:38:32,244
What possible difference can I make?

831
01:38:32,536 --> 01:38:34,788
This man wants what you want.

832
01:38:34,871 --> 01:38:37,082
Then have him kill Commodus!

833
01:38:39,709 --> 01:38:41,503
I knew a man once,

834
01:38:42,420 --> 01:38:43,713
a noble man.

835
01:38:44,714 --> 01:38:47,592
A man of principle who loved my father,

836
01:38:48,552 --> 01:38:50,637
and my father loved him.

837
01:38:52,597 --> 01:38:54,766
This man served Rome well.

838
01:38:59,104 --> 01:39:00,814
That man is gone.

839
01:39:01,982 --> 01:39:04,109
Your brother did his work well.

840
01:39:04,192 --> 01:39:05,861
Let me help you.

841
01:39:11,658 --> 01:39:14,703
Yes, you can help me.

842
01:39:18,039 --> 01:39:21,751
Forget you ever knew me,
never come here again.

843
01:39:25,463 --> 01:39:28,175
Guard! The lady is finished with me.

844
01:39:56,953 --> 01:39:58,288
Maximus.

845
01:39:59,039 --> 01:40:02,167
You commanded legions?
You had many victories?

846
01:40:03,043 --> 01:40:05,253
-Yes.
-In Germania?

847
01:40:07,172 --> 01:40:08,924
In many countries.

848
01:40:10,508 --> 01:40:11,843
General.

849
01:41:00,934 --> 01:41:02,811
You have a great name.

850
01:41:04,312 --> 01:41:07,357
He must kill your name
before he kills you.

851
01:41:16,324 --> 01:41:17,659
Yes, at the far end.

852
01:41:17,742 --> 01:41:19,661
-Senator Gaius.
-Hello.

853
01:41:20,161 --> 01:41:22,122
Senator Gracchus.

854
01:41:23,707 --> 01:41:27,127
Don't often see you enjoying
the pleasures of the vulgar crowd.

855
01:41:27,210 --> 01:41:30,338
I don't pretend to be
a man of the people, Senator,

856
01:41:30,422 --> 01:41:32,966
but I do try to be a man for the people.

857
01:41:49,190 --> 01:41:54,446
-Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!
-Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

858
01:41:58,950 --> 01:42:00,577
People of Rome!

859
01:42:02,871 --> 01:42:05,332
On the fourth day of Antioch,

860
01:42:05,957 --> 01:42:10,337
we can celebrate
the 64th day of the games.

861
01:42:10,962 --> 01:42:15,216
And in his majestic charity,

862
01:42:15,967 --> 01:42:20,180
the Emperor has deigned this day
to favor the people of Rome

863
01:42:20,764 --> 01:42:24,184
with an historical final match.

864
01:42:24,976 --> 01:42:29,564
Returning to the Colosseum today,
after five years in retirement,

865
01:42:30,982 --> 01:42:34,444
Caesar is pleased to bring you

866
01:42:34,527 --> 01:42:38,323
the only undefeated champion

867
01:42:38,406 --> 01:42:40,367
in Roman history,

868
01:42:40,450 --> 01:42:45,372
the legendary Tigris of Gaul!

869
01:43:06,935 --> 01:43:10,105
He knows too well
how to manipulate the mob.

870
01:43:10,188 --> 01:43:12,899
Marcus Aurelius had a dream
that was Rome, Proximo.

871
01:43:12,982 --> 01:43:15,777
This is not it. This is not it!

872
01:43:15,860 --> 01:43:18,696
Marcus Aurelius is dead, Maximus.

873
01:43:19,531 --> 01:43:22,117
We mortals are but shadows and dust.

874
01:43:22,784 --> 01:43:24,911
Shadows and dust, Maximus!

875
01:43:24,994 --> 01:43:28,873
Representing the training lyceum
of Antonius Proximo,

876
01:43:28,957 --> 01:43:32,627
Caesar is proud to give you

877
01:43:32,710 --> 01:43:36,548
Aelius Maximus!

878
01:43:49,352 --> 01:43:51,729
They embrace him
like he's one of their own.

879
01:43:51,813 --> 01:43:55,733
The mob is fickle, brother.
He'll be forgotten in a month.

880
01:43:58,486 --> 01:44:01,322
No, much sooner than that.

881
01:44:03,241 --> 01:44:05,034
It's been arranged.

882
01:44:23,553 --> 01:44:26,514
We who are about to die salute you.

883
01:44:29,851 --> 01:44:31,644
We're with you, Maximus!

884
01:45:14,229 --> 01:45:16,022
Fight on, finish it!

885
01:45:44,259 --> 01:45:45,927
Pull, pull!

886
01:46:18,293 --> 01:46:19,836
Loose! Loose!

887
01:46:47,947 --> 01:46:50,033
-Gut him!
-Kill!

888
01:46:51,492 --> 01:46:55,079
-Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!
-Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

889
01:47:15,516 --> 01:47:17,560
-Kill!
-Kill!

890
01:47:55,431 --> 01:47:57,642
Maximus the Merciful!

891
01:48:06,818 --> 01:48:12,573
-Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!
-Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

892
01:48:19,789 --> 01:48:22,417
Forward, arms at ready!

893
01:48:52,405 --> 01:48:54,782
What am I going to do with you?

894
01:48:55,950 --> 01:48:59,412
You simply won't die.

895
01:49:04,167 --> 01:49:06,544
Are we so different, you and I?

896
01:49:07,670 --> 01:49:10,590
You take life when you have to, as I do.

897
01:49:11,966 --> 01:49:15,636
I have only one more life to take.
Then it is done.

898
01:49:16,179 --> 01:49:17,930
Then take it now.

899
01:49:30,985 --> 01:49:32,987
They tell me your son

900
01:49:33,780 --> 01:49:37,700
squealed like a girl
when they nailed him to the cross.

901
01:49:39,827 --> 01:49:41,496
And your wife

902
01:49:42,747 --> 01:49:44,665
moaned like a whore

903
01:49:45,792 --> 01:49:50,338
when they ravaged her again and again

904
01:49:51,672 --> 01:49:53,090
and again.

905
01:49:58,346 --> 01:50:02,099
The time for honoring yourself
will soon be at an end,

906
01:50:06,687 --> 01:50:08,064
Highness.

907
01:50:35,591 --> 01:50:38,469
General! General!

908
01:50:39,971 --> 01:50:41,389
General! General!

909
01:50:43,432 --> 01:50:45,226
-General!
-Cicero!

910
01:50:52,692 --> 01:50:54,193
-General!
-Where are you camped?

911
01:50:54,277 --> 01:50:55,570
Ostia.

912
01:51:02,034 --> 01:51:04,996
-We love you, Maximus!
-Praise the victor!

913
01:51:05,079 --> 01:51:07,582
Tell the men their general lives.
Find me.

914
01:51:07,748 --> 01:51:09,542
-Move along!
-Find me!

915
01:51:35,401 --> 01:51:37,361
Can they hear you?

916
01:51:40,948 --> 01:51:44,452
-Who?
-Your family, in the afterlife.

917
01:51:46,954 --> 01:51:49,290
-Yes.
-What do you say to them?

918
01:51:53,169 --> 01:51:54,629
To my boy,

919
01:51:56,464 --> 01:51:59,008
I tell him I will see him again soon,

920
01:51:59,091 --> 01:52:02,678
and to keep his heels down
when he's riding his horse.

921
01:52:03,971 --> 01:52:05,473
To my wife,

922
01:52:07,975 --> 01:52:10,102
that is not your business.

923
01:52:17,610 --> 01:52:20,488
And now they love Maximus
for his mercy.

924
01:52:21,906 --> 01:52:25,451
So I can't just kill him,
or it makes me even more unmerciful.

925
01:52:26,786 --> 01:52:30,998
The whole thing
is like some great nightmare.

926
01:52:32,291 --> 01:52:34,085
He is defying you.

927
01:52:34,168 --> 01:52:37,546
His every victory is an act of defiance.

928
01:52:37,630 --> 01:52:41,258
The mob sees this,
and so do the Senate.

929
01:52:42,009 --> 01:52:44,929
Every day he lives, they grow bolder.

930
01:52:46,472 --> 01:52:48,224
-Kill him.
-No.

931
01:52:50,101 --> 01:52:52,520
I will not make a martyr of him.

932
01:52:58,693 --> 01:53:02,405
I have been told of a certain sea snake

933
01:53:02,488 --> 01:53:06,492
which has a very unusual method
of attracting its prey.

934
01:53:06,992 --> 01:53:10,705
It will lie at the bottom
of the ocean as if wounded.

935
01:53:11,831 --> 01:53:14,166
Then its enemies will approach,

936
01:53:14,250 --> 01:53:17,336
and yet it will lie quite still.

937
01:53:17,670 --> 01:53:21,465
And then its enemies
will take little bites of it,

938
01:53:21,549 --> 01:53:24,844
and yet it remains still.

939
01:53:28,055 --> 01:53:29,223
So,

940
01:53:30,558 --> 01:53:32,351
we will lie still,

941
01:53:33,060 --> 01:53:36,397
and let our enemies come to us
and nibble.

942
01:53:37,565 --> 01:53:39,817
Have every senator followed.

943
01:53:57,460 --> 01:53:59,211
Cicero, my old friend.

944
01:53:59,295 --> 01:54:01,172
I thought perhaps I'd seen you
for the last time.

945
01:54:01,255 --> 01:54:03,799
-I thought you were dead.
-Close.

946
01:54:03,883 --> 01:54:05,509
How long have the men been in Ostia?

947
01:54:05,593 --> 01:54:06,927
All winter.

948
01:54:07,261 --> 01:54:10,556
-And how do they look?
-Fat and bored.

949
01:54:11,265 --> 01:54:14,310
-Who's in command?
-Some fool from Rome.

950
01:54:15,936 --> 01:54:17,772
How soon do you think
they could be ready to fight?

951
01:54:17,855 --> 01:54:19,648
For you, tomorrow.

952
01:54:21,108 --> 01:54:23,611
I need you to do something for me.

953
01:54:28,240 --> 01:54:29,658
Come, see, witness.

954
01:54:29,742 --> 01:54:32,787
If you haven't been in the arena,
you can see the show here.

955
01:54:32,870 --> 01:54:36,499
Giant Maximus
is defeating our emperor, Commodus.

956
01:54:36,582 --> 01:54:39,210
What are we to do?
He's just defying everyone,

957
01:54:39,293 --> 01:54:40,961
by doing this to him, they do...

958
01:54:42,213 --> 01:54:43,547
My goodness!

959
01:54:45,341 --> 01:54:48,928
-He got him, he's defeated.
-Give way!

960
01:54:55,017 --> 01:54:57,603
My lady?
I served your father at Vindobona.

961
01:54:57,686 --> 01:54:59,230
-Back.
-My lady.

962
01:54:59,313 --> 01:55:01,732
I served your father at Vindobona.

963
01:55:01,816 --> 01:55:02,900
Back!

964
01:55:02,983 --> 01:55:06,195
And I served General Maximus.
I serve him still.

965
01:55:07,696 --> 01:55:09,281
Stop. Stop.

966
01:55:09,824 --> 01:55:10,991
Stop!

967
01:55:11,909 --> 01:55:13,327
Stand back.

968
01:55:14,620 --> 01:55:17,665
The general sends word,
he will meet your politician.

969
01:55:19,375 --> 01:55:22,670
-For your loyalty, soldier.
-Thank you, my lady.

970
01:55:32,429 --> 01:55:33,764
Leave us.

971
01:55:39,478 --> 01:55:41,188
Senator Gracchus.

972
01:55:54,994 --> 01:55:56,287
General.

973
01:55:57,371 --> 01:56:00,124
I hope my coming here today
is evidence enough

974
01:56:00,207 --> 01:56:03,294
that you can trust me.

975
01:56:07,590 --> 01:56:10,050
-The Senate is with you?
-The Senate?

976
01:56:11,552 --> 01:56:14,263
Yes. I can speak for them.

977
01:56:14,889 --> 01:56:18,225
You can buy my freedom
and smuggle me out of Rome?

978
01:56:18,601 --> 01:56:20,060
To what end?

979
01:56:21,520 --> 01:56:23,856
Get me outside the city walls.

980
01:56:24,440 --> 01:56:28,319
Have fresh horses ready to take me
to Ostia. My army is encamped there.

981
01:56:28,402 --> 01:56:31,739
By nightfall of the second day,
I shall return at the head of 5,000 men.

982
01:56:31,822 --> 01:56:34,074
But the legions
all have new commanders,

983
01:56:34,158 --> 01:56:35,576
loyal to Commodus.

984
01:56:35,659 --> 01:56:38,829
Let my men see me alive, and
you shall see where their loyalties lie.

985
01:56:38,913 --> 01:56:40,581
This is madness.

986
01:56:41,248 --> 01:56:44,585
No Roman army has entered
the capital in 100 years.

987
01:56:44,668 --> 01:56:46,921
I will not trade one dictatorship
for another!

988
01:56:47,004 --> 01:56:50,549
The time for half measures
and talk is over, Senator.

989
01:56:51,091 --> 01:56:54,178
And after your glorious coup,
what then?

990
01:56:55,387 --> 01:56:59,016
You'll take your 5,000 warriors
and leave?

991
01:56:59,099 --> 01:57:00,643
I Will leave.

992
01:57:01,143 --> 01:57:03,187
The soldiers will stay
for your protection,

993
01:57:03,270 --> 01:57:04,939
under the command of the Senate.

994
01:57:05,064 --> 01:57:06,231
So,

995
01:57:06,565 --> 01:57:10,778
once all of Rome is yours,
you'll just give it back to the people?

996
01:57:12,154 --> 01:57:13,155
Tell me why.

997
01:57:19,161 --> 01:57:22,289
Because that was the last wish
of a dying man.

998
01:57:25,376 --> 01:57:27,252
I will kill Commodus.

999
01:57:29,004 --> 01:57:32,091
The fate of Rome I leave to you.

1000
01:57:34,009 --> 01:57:36,261
Marcus Aurelius trusted you.

1001
01:57:38,097 --> 01:57:40,182
His daughter trusts you.

1002
01:57:44,144 --> 01:57:45,854
I will trust you.

1003
01:57:46,063 --> 01:57:48,107
But we have little time.

1004
01:57:48,816 --> 01:57:50,609
Give me two days,

1005
01:57:51,402 --> 01:57:53,612
and I will buy your freedom.

1006
01:57:54,279 --> 01:57:55,614
And you,

1007
01:57:57,116 --> 01:57:58,742
you stay alive,

1008
01:58:00,244 --> 01:58:01,912
or I'll be dead.

1009
01:58:03,831 --> 01:58:05,457
Now we must go.

1010
01:58:10,671 --> 01:58:12,131
It won't work.

1011
01:58:13,132 --> 01:58:15,259
The Emperor knows too much.

1012
01:58:16,010 --> 01:58:17,052
And as for me,

1013
01:58:19,304 --> 01:58:21,390
it's becoming dangerous.

1014
01:58:22,516 --> 01:58:24,810
You'll be paid on my return.

1015
01:58:26,979 --> 01:58:28,814
I give you my word.

1016
01:58:29,023 --> 01:58:32,151
Your word? What if you don't return?

1017
01:58:33,193 --> 01:58:36,155
Do you remember what it was
to have trust, Proximo?

1018
01:58:36,280 --> 01:58:37,489
Trust?

1019
01:58:41,952 --> 01:58:43,662
Who am I to trust?

1020
01:58:44,288 --> 01:58:47,458
-I will kill Commodus.
-Why would I want that?

1021
01:58:48,125 --> 01:58:49,835
He makes me rich.

1022
01:58:55,090 --> 01:58:57,885
I know that you are a man
of your word, General.

1023
01:58:59,678 --> 01:59:02,264
I know that you would die for honor.

1024
01:59:03,557 --> 01:59:05,517
You would die for Rome.

1025
01:59:06,602 --> 01:59:09,730
You would die for the memory
of your ancestors.

1026
01:59:09,813 --> 01:59:12,066
But I, on the other hand,

1027
01:59:14,818 --> 01:59:16,653
I'm an entertainer.

1028
01:59:20,157 --> 01:59:21,366
Guard!

1029
01:59:26,205 --> 01:59:28,749
He killed the man who set you free.

1030
01:59:37,925 --> 01:59:39,760
Praetorians, master.

1031
01:59:45,891 --> 01:59:47,017
Halt!

1032
01:59:57,736 --> 01:59:59,530
Where have you been?

1033
01:59:59,947 --> 02:00:01,573
I sent for you.

1034
02:00:03,075 --> 02:00:04,743
Please, brother.

1035
02:00:10,499 --> 02:00:12,376
What's troubling you?

1036
02:00:14,753 --> 02:00:17,089
Does Gracchus have a new lover?

1037
02:00:19,049 --> 02:00:20,551
I don't know.

1038
02:00:22,553 --> 02:00:24,638
I thought you'd seen him.

1039
02:00:25,514 --> 02:00:28,142
He infects everyone like a putrid fever.

1040
02:00:29,977 --> 02:00:33,188
For the health of Rome,
the Senate must be bled.

1041
02:00:33,605 --> 02:00:35,649
And he will bleed, too.

1042
02:00:36,525 --> 02:00:37,901
Very soon.

1043
02:00:39,403 --> 02:00:41,071
But not tonight.

1044
02:00:56,086 --> 02:00:59,006
Do you remember
what our father said once?

1045
02:01:00,340 --> 02:01:02,009
"It's a dream,

1046
02:01:03,886 --> 02:01:05,804
"a frightful dream,

1047
02:01:08,348 --> 02:01:09,683
"life is."

1048
02:01:12,394 --> 02:01:14,479
Do you think that's true?

1049
02:01:15,230 --> 02:01:16,732
I don't know.

1050
02:01:20,319 --> 02:01:21,862
I think it is.

1051
02:01:24,615 --> 02:01:27,367
And I have only you to share it with.

1052
02:02:04,947 --> 02:02:06,573
Open your mouth.

1053
02:02:43,860 --> 02:02:45,654
You know I love you.

1054
02:02:47,739 --> 02:02:49,324
And I love you.

1055
02:03:25,986 --> 02:03:27,529
Out. Get out!

1056
02:03:28,739 --> 02:03:29,990
Move!

1057
02:03:34,661 --> 02:03:36,705
Congratulations, General.

1058
02:03:36,788 --> 02:03:39,583
You've got very persuasive friends.

1059
02:03:45,589 --> 02:03:48,091
My brother has had Gracchus arrested.

1060
02:03:48,175 --> 02:03:51,636
We daren't wait any longer.
We must leave tonight.

1061
02:03:51,720 --> 02:03:55,348
Proximo will come at midnight
and take you to the gate.

1062
02:03:56,016 --> 02:03:59,686
Your servant, Cicero,
will be waiting there with horses.

1063
02:04:01,688 --> 02:04:03,982
-You have done all this?
-Yes.

1064
02:04:05,192 --> 02:04:06,902
You risk too much.

1065
02:04:07,861 --> 02:04:09,863
I have much to pay for.

1066
02:04:12,282 --> 02:04:14,493
You have nothing to pay for.

1067
02:04:14,576 --> 02:04:17,662
You love your son.
You're strong for him.

1068
02:04:20,874 --> 02:04:23,210
I am tired of being strong.

1069
02:04:25,170 --> 02:04:29,382
My brother hates all the world,
and you most of all.

1070
02:04:29,883 --> 02:04:33,011
-Because your father chose me.
-No.

1071
02:04:34,304 --> 02:04:36,556
Because my father loved you.

1072
02:04:40,477 --> 02:04:42,896
And because I loved you.

1073
02:04:45,482 --> 02:04:47,150
A long time ago.

1074
02:04:51,905 --> 02:04:54,032
Was I very different then?

1075
02:05:00,580 --> 02:05:02,332
You laughed more.

1076
02:05:06,419 --> 02:05:08,839
I have felt alone all my life,

1077
02:05:10,132 --> 02:05:11,800
except with you.

1078
02:05:14,886 --> 02:05:16,263
I must go.

1079
02:05:16,930 --> 02:05:18,056
Yes.

1080
02:05:46,543 --> 02:05:47,752
There.

1081
02:05:59,306 --> 02:06:00,807
And I got you.

1082
02:06:03,852 --> 02:06:05,770
Isn't it late to be playing legionnaire?

1083
02:06:05,854 --> 02:06:07,939
I'm not a legionnaire.

1084
02:06:08,273 --> 02:06:10,859
-Not a legionnaire?
-I'm a gladiator.

1085
02:06:12,152 --> 02:06:13,612
A gladiator?

1086
02:06:14,321 --> 02:06:16,990
Gladiators only fight in the games.

1087
02:06:17,073 --> 02:06:20,493
Wouldn't you rather be a great
Roman warrior like Julius Caesar?

1088
02:06:20,577 --> 02:06:23,163
I'm Maximus, the savior of Rome!

1089
02:06:25,999 --> 02:06:27,834
The savior of Rome?

1090
02:06:35,842 --> 02:06:37,552
And who said that?

1091
02:06:46,394 --> 02:06:47,979
Where's Lucius?

1092
02:06:49,189 --> 02:06:51,608
He's with the Emperor, my lady.

1093
02:06:54,527 --> 02:06:56,238
-She couldn't.
-Yes, she did.

1094
02:06:56,321 --> 02:06:58,531
She took it from a basket,

1095
02:06:59,950 --> 02:07:03,703
and pressed it to her breast,
right here above her heart.

1096
02:07:05,330 --> 02:07:08,541
-It bit her in the breast?
-Yes.

1097
02:07:09,209 --> 02:07:13,171
You see, Lucius,
sometimes royal ladies

1098
02:07:13,672 --> 02:07:17,634
behave very strangely and do
very odd things in the name of love.

1099
02:07:17,717 --> 02:07:20,303
-I think it's silly.
-So do I.

1100
02:07:22,389 --> 02:07:23,723
So do I.

1101
02:07:24,266 --> 02:07:26,351
Sister, join us.

1102
02:07:26,977 --> 02:07:28,728
I've been reading to dear Lucius.

1103
02:07:28,812 --> 02:07:30,814
-I've been reading, too.
-Yes.

1104
02:07:30,897 --> 02:07:35,235
He's a very clever little boy.
He'll make a grand emperor one day.

1105
02:07:36,778 --> 02:07:39,197
We've been reading about
the great Mark Antony,

1106
02:07:39,281 --> 02:07:40,615
and his adventures in Egypt.

1107
02:07:40,699 --> 02:07:43,243
And the queen killed herself
with a snake.

1108
02:07:43,326 --> 02:07:46,663
And just wait until you hear
what happened to our ancestors.

1109
02:07:46,746 --> 02:07:48,581
If you're very good,

1110
02:07:48,665 --> 02:07:52,460
tomorrow night, I'll tell you
the story of Emperor Claudius.

1111
02:07:52,544 --> 02:07:54,254
He was betrayed

1112
02:07:55,463 --> 02:07:57,590
by those closest to him.

1113
02:07:59,467 --> 02:08:01,219
By his own blood.

1114
02:08:02,554 --> 02:08:05,015
They whispered in dark corners

1115
02:08:05,098 --> 02:08:07,559
and went out late at night,

1116
02:08:07,642 --> 02:08:10,979
and conspired, and conspired.

1117
02:08:13,606 --> 02:08:17,444
But the Emperor Claudius knew
that they were up to something.

1118
02:08:17,569 --> 02:08:20,113
He knew they were busy little bees.

1119
02:08:22,073 --> 02:08:25,118
And one night he sat down
with one of them,

1120
02:08:25,910 --> 02:08:27,912
and he looked at her,

1121
02:08:28,663 --> 02:08:30,206
and he said,

1122
02:08:31,374 --> 02:08:33,960
"Tell me what you've been doing,

1123
02:08:34,627 --> 02:08:36,338
"busy little bee.

1124
02:08:38,631 --> 02:08:41,718
"Or I shall strike down
those dearest to you.

1125
02:08:42,886 --> 02:08:45,930
"You shall watch
as I bathe in their blood."

1126
02:08:49,642 --> 02:08:52,062
And the Emperor was heartbroken.

1127
02:08:54,147 --> 02:08:56,358
The little bee
had wounded him more deeply

1128
02:08:56,441 --> 02:08:59,152
than anyone else could ever have done.

1129
02:09:01,279 --> 02:09:04,157
What do you think happened then,
Lucius?

1130
02:09:04,783 --> 02:09:06,618
I don't know, Uncle.

1131
02:09:13,124 --> 02:09:15,710
The little bee told him everything.

1132
02:09:54,749 --> 02:09:57,752
Open, in the name of the Emperor!

1133
02:09:58,461 --> 02:09:59,754
Proximo!

1134
02:10:00,672 --> 02:10:03,550
Open the gates,
in the name of the Emperor!

1135
02:10:04,843 --> 02:10:06,177
Proximo!

1136
02:10:08,388 --> 02:10:09,848
Open the gates!

1137
02:10:15,687 --> 02:10:17,981
Open the gates, Proximo.

1138
02:10:18,440 --> 02:10:20,692
Do you want to die, old man?

1139
02:10:21,901 --> 02:10:23,027
Here.

1140
02:10:23,611 --> 02:10:25,780
Everything is prepared.

1141
02:10:25,864 --> 02:10:28,324
It seems you have won your freedom.

1142
02:10:28,408 --> 02:10:31,995
Proximo, are you in danger
of becoming a good man?

1143
02:10:37,083 --> 02:10:40,920
-Juba.
-All enemies of the Emperor die!

1144
02:10:41,463 --> 02:10:43,631
Open the gates!

1145
02:10:49,137 --> 02:10:51,097
Pull!

1146
02:10:53,224 --> 02:10:56,102
Move! Form a column on the left!

1147
02:10:59,898 --> 02:11:03,109
I only need moments, so do not
be careless with your lives.

1148
02:11:03,193 --> 02:11:05,653
If you don't want any part of this,
go back to your cells.

1149
02:11:05,737 --> 02:11:07,989
We'll wait here for you, Maximus.

1150
02:11:08,072 --> 02:11:09,866
-Strength and honor.
-Strength and honor.

1151
02:11:09,949 --> 02:11:10,992
Go.

1152
02:11:11,868 --> 02:11:13,703
Strength and honor.

1153
02:11:16,331 --> 02:11:19,167
Aim. Arch your bows!

1154
02:12:26,276 --> 02:12:27,569
Shadows and dust.

1155
02:13:09,485 --> 02:13:10,737
Maximus!

1156
02:13:16,200 --> 02:13:17,619
I'm sorry.

1157
02:13:44,020 --> 02:13:45,396
It's done.

1158
02:13:52,362 --> 02:13:54,238
And what of my nephew?

1159
02:13:55,323 --> 02:13:57,325
And what of his mother?

1160
02:13:59,410 --> 02:14:01,954
Should they share her lover's fate?

1161
02:14:03,665 --> 02:14:05,708
Or should I be merciful?

1162
02:14:08,419 --> 02:14:10,338
Commodus the Merciful.

1163
02:14:16,761 --> 02:14:19,097
Lucius will stay with me now.

1164
02:14:20,264 --> 02:14:22,058
And if his mother

1165
02:14:23,434 --> 02:14:25,561
so much as looks at me

1166
02:14:26,729 --> 02:14:29,232
in a manner that displeases me,

1167
02:14:31,192 --> 02:14:32,610
he will die.

1168
02:14:36,114 --> 02:14:39,367
If she decides to be noble,

1169
02:14:41,119 --> 02:14:43,204
and takes her own life,

1170
02:14:44,789 --> 02:14:46,249
he will die.

1171
02:14:49,877 --> 02:14:51,587
And as for you,

1172
02:14:54,382 --> 02:14:56,134
you will love me,

1173
02:14:56,968 --> 02:14:58,761
as I have loved you.

1174
02:15:00,346 --> 02:15:04,016
You will provide me with an heir
of pure blood,

1175
02:15:04,976 --> 02:15:06,811
so that Commodus

1176
02:15:07,395 --> 02:15:10,356
and his progeny will rule for 1,000 years.

1177
02:15:14,986 --> 02:15:16,738
Am I not merciful?

1178
02:15:38,593 --> 02:15:41,220
Am I not merciful!

1179
02:15:53,441 --> 02:15:57,445
-Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!
-Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

1180
02:16:37,735 --> 02:16:39,028
Maximus.

1181
02:16:40,071 --> 02:16:41,405
Maximus.

1182
02:16:42,406 --> 02:16:43,699
Maximus.

1183
02:16:45,409 --> 02:16:47,245
They call for you.

1184
02:16:49,205 --> 02:16:52,458
The general who became a slave.

1185
02:16:53,709 --> 02:16:56,087
The slave who became a gladiator.

1186
02:16:57,463 --> 02:17:00,258
The gladiator who defied an emperor.

1187
02:17:02,260 --> 02:17:03,928
A striking story.

1188
02:17:05,096 --> 02:17:08,307
Now the people want to know
how the story ends.

1189
02:17:10,685 --> 02:17:12,937
Only a famous death will do.

1190
02:17:14,856 --> 02:17:17,400
And what could be more glorious

1191
02:17:17,775 --> 02:17:21,529
than to challenge the Emperor
himself in the great arena?

1192
02:17:23,865 --> 02:17:26,909
-You would fight me?
-Why not?

1193
02:17:27,994 --> 02:17:30,037
Do you think I'm afraid?

1194
02:17:30,955 --> 02:17:34,000
I think you have been afraid all your life.

1195
02:17:34,083 --> 02:17:37,795
Unlike Maximus the Invincible,
who knows no fear?

1196
02:17:43,551 --> 02:17:46,929
I knew a man who once said,
"Death smiles at us all.

1197
02:17:47,805 --> 02:17:50,308
"All a man can do is smile back."

1198
02:17:52,101 --> 02:17:53,519
I wonder,

1199
02:17:54,145 --> 02:17:56,939
did your friend smile at his own death?

1200
02:17:57,315 --> 02:17:58,816
You must know.

1201
02:18:01,736 --> 02:18:03,529
He was your father.

1202
02:18:07,408 --> 02:18:09,744
You loved my father, I know,

1203
02:18:11,245 --> 02:18:12,747
but so did I.

1204
02:18:14,373 --> 02:18:16,959
That makes us brothers, doesn't it?

1205
02:18:19,587 --> 02:18:21,339
Smile for me now, brother.

1206
02:18:27,345 --> 02:18:30,181
Strap on his armor.
Conceal the wound.

1207
02:19:24,610 --> 02:19:26,570
Ring formation!

1208
02:21:18,349 --> 02:21:19,975
Quintus, sword.

1209
02:21:21,477 --> 02:21:23,270
Give me your sword.

1210
02:21:26,690 --> 02:21:28,692
Sword! Give me a sword!

1211
02:21:30,194 --> 02:21:33,697
Sheathe your swords.
Sheathe your swords!

1212
02:23:49,166 --> 02:23:50,501
Maximus.

1213
02:23:55,881 --> 02:23:57,174
Maximus.

1214
02:23:57,758 --> 02:23:59,093
Quintus.

1215
02:24:00,761 --> 02:24:02,221
Free my men.

1216
02:24:03,597 --> 02:24:06,308
Senator Gracchus is to be reinstated.

1217
02:24:07,601 --> 02:24:09,687
There was a dream that was Rome.

1218
02:24:10,354 --> 02:24:12,231
It shall be realized.

1219
02:24:12,773 --> 02:24:15,359
These are the wishes
of Marcus Aurelius.

1220
02:24:16,443 --> 02:24:18,445
Free the prisoners. Go!

1221
02:24:43,220 --> 02:24:44,555
Maximus.

1222
02:24:46,432 --> 02:24:48,017
Lucius is safe.

1223
02:25:04,324 --> 02:25:05,743
Go to them.

1224
02:25:55,542 --> 02:25:56,960
You're home.

1225
02:26:23,612 --> 02:26:26,156
Is Rome worth one good man's life?

1226
02:26:30,035 --> 02:26:31,829
We believed it once.

1227
02:26:35,040 --> 02:26:37,167
Make us believe it again.

1228
02:26:40,671 --> 02:26:42,756
He was a soldier of Rome.

1229
02:26:46,593 --> 02:26:48,011
Honor him.

1230
02:26:48,470 --> 02:26:50,639
Who will help me carry him?

1231
02:27:35,392 --> 02:27:37,060
Now we are free.

1232
02:27:43,442 --> 02:27:45,319
I will see you again.

1233
02:27:48,197 --> 02:27:49,656
But not yet.

1234
02:27:50,657 --> 02:27:51,992
Not yet.
