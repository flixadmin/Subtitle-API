1
00:00:01,737 --> 00:00:03,714
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:03,846 --> 00:00:05,986
After 5 years in Hell,
I returned home

3
00:00:05,993 --> 00:00:08,494
with only one goal--
to save my city.

4
00:00:08,496 --> 00:00:10,262
But I couldn't honor that
commitment

5
00:00:10,264 --> 00:00:13,365
and honor the promise I made
to the mother of my son,

6
00:00:13,367 --> 00:00:15,501
so I asked the best man I know
to help.

7
00:00:15,503 --> 00:00:17,069
His name is John Diggle,

8
00:00:17,071 --> 00:00:20,906
and he is the Green Arrow.

9
00:00:20,908 --> 00:00:22,374
Previously on "Arrow"...

10
00:00:22,376 --> 00:00:23,976
Our old friend
Alex Faust.

11
00:00:23,978 --> 00:00:25,677
Ok, clearly he was at SCPD

12
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:27,079
when the explosion went off.

13
00:00:27,081 --> 00:00:28,313
So he's
either died or escaped.

14
00:00:28,315 --> 00:00:29,648
He escaped.

15
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:31,049
Special Agent
Samanda Watson.

16
00:00:31,051 --> 00:00:32,718
Can we help
you with something?

17
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,886
I'm here
as a courtesy

18
00:00:33,888 --> 00:00:35,154
to inform you
of the investigation

19
00:00:35,156 --> 00:00:36,321
I'll be conducting
in your city.

20
00:00:36,323 --> 00:00:38,223
- Investigation into what?
- You.

21
00:00:38,225 --> 00:00:40,459
Ok. Present us is
only worried

22
00:00:40,461 --> 00:00:41,994
about you quitting your
nobody-told-about job.

23
00:00:41,996 --> 00:00:43,362
When are you gonna
let that go?

24
00:00:43,364 --> 00:00:45,230
When you go
into business with me.

25
00:00:45,232 --> 00:00:46,398
Wait. I'm sorry.
Go into what with you?

26
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,533
Think about all
the good we could do.

27
00:00:47,535 --> 00:00:48,492
Yes.

28
00:00:48,493 --> 00:00:50,903
On Lian Yu, Felicity and I
got caught in one of the explosions.

29
00:00:50,905 --> 00:00:52,137
I thought you guys
were fine.

30
00:00:52,139 --> 00:00:53,872
I have nerve damage.

31
00:00:53,874 --> 00:00:55,274
That's why you haven't
been pulling your gun.

32
00:00:55,276 --> 00:00:57,209
It's just a tremor.
I can manage it.

33
00:00:58,646 --> 00:01:00,546
You nearly got killed
last night

34
00:01:00,548 --> 00:01:01,747
because you couldn't
rely on me.

35
00:01:01,749 --> 00:01:03,048
But what are you
gonna do about it?

36
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:04,183
Tell Oliver.

37
00:01:14,728 --> 00:01:16,562
Eyes on Faust?

38
00:01:17,698 --> 00:01:19,431
Shoot her!

39
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:25,270
I got him. He's in
the structure next door.

40
00:01:25,272 --> 00:01:26,838
- Everyone get into position.
- Copy that.

41
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,240
- On it, Hoss.
- You got it.

42
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:46,658
Hurry!

43
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,061
Hurry!

44
00:01:49,063 --> 00:01:50,295
Get him!

45
00:02:05,279 --> 00:02:06,311
Uh!

46
00:02:18,726 --> 00:02:21,260
Ooh.
Down for the count.

47
00:02:21,262 --> 00:02:23,328
No more bombs
for you, bitch.

48
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:24,496
Go, Green Arrow.

49
00:02:24,498 --> 00:02:25,764
Or should I call
you the Green Arrow?

50
00:02:25,766 --> 00:02:26,999
It feels kind of weird.

51
00:02:27,001 --> 00:02:28,433
It's weird,

52
00:02:28,435 --> 00:02:29,730
but at some point, we all
have get to used to it.

53
00:02:29,754 --> 00:02:33,754

55
00:02:41,115 --> 00:02:42,981
It seemed to go well
out there tonight.

56
00:02:42,983 --> 00:02:44,516
Yeah, we make a good team.

57
00:02:44,518 --> 00:02:46,718
And yet you still have
worried face.

58
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,120
It's because sooner
or later,

59
00:02:48,122 --> 00:02:49,788
someone's going
to find out

60
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:51,056
that the Green Arrow

61
00:02:51,058 --> 00:02:52,624
isn't shooting
any arrows.

62
00:02:52,626 --> 00:02:54,459
Yeah, well, Curtis
and I are working on that.

63
00:02:54,461 --> 00:02:55,827
We're gonna
figure something out.

64
00:02:55,829 --> 00:02:57,162
Good. Thank you.

65
00:02:57,164 --> 00:03:00,032
Ok. I am going to go home.

66
00:03:00,034 --> 00:03:01,366
I'm going to sleep,

67
00:03:01,368 --> 00:03:03,135
and maybe I'll even get
4 hours.

68
00:03:06,006 --> 00:03:07,406
Maybe in another week,

69
00:03:07,408 --> 00:03:08,907
I'll get used to that
judgmental stare

70
00:03:08,909 --> 00:03:10,642
you keep giving me.

71
00:03:10,644 --> 00:03:12,911
This isn't judgment.
It's amusement.

72
00:03:12,913 --> 00:03:14,680
Hmm.

73
00:03:14,682 --> 00:03:16,381
"Sooner or later,
someone's gonna find out

74
00:03:16,383 --> 00:03:17,582
the Green Arrow isn't
shooting any arrows."

75
00:03:17,584 --> 00:03:18,950
Dinah, I'm not an Archer.

76
00:03:18,952 --> 00:03:20,419
No, it's not about
the arrows, John.

77
00:03:20,421 --> 00:03:21,653
It's about the injury.

78
00:03:21,655 --> 00:03:23,388
I thought you were
gonna talk to Oliver.

79
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,023
I was...

80
00:03:25,025 --> 00:03:27,059
Until he asked me
to put this on.

81
00:03:27,061 --> 00:03:28,927
Which he never would have
done if he knew the truth.

82
00:03:28,929 --> 00:03:30,829
Dinah, what do you
want from me?

83
00:03:30,831 --> 00:03:32,597
The man's under
the FBI microscope.

84
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:34,199
He's worried about
his son.

85
00:03:34,201 --> 00:03:35,334
Imagine how worried
he'd be if he knew

86
00:03:35,336 --> 00:03:37,069
you were out there
compromised.

87
00:03:37,071 --> 00:03:40,072
Did you see me tonight?
Did I look compromised?

88
00:03:41,408 --> 00:03:43,175
Dinah, I have this
handled.

89
00:03:43,177 --> 00:03:44,643
The tremor's gone.

90
00:03:44,645 --> 00:03:48,780
Well, I guess I worried
for nothing, then.

91
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,626
Good morning.

92
00:04:01,628 --> 00:04:03,195
Good morning.

93
00:04:03,197 --> 00:04:05,864
You like your eggs
scrambled, right?

94
00:04:05,866 --> 00:04:07,232
Yes, I do.

95
00:04:07,234 --> 00:04:09,634
Good. That's what
I made you.

96
00:04:09,636 --> 00:04:12,904
This is for real-for real,
isn't it?

97
00:04:12,906 --> 00:04:14,206
Me being around more?

98
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,807
And not the other guy?

99
00:04:17,544 --> 00:04:21,546
It is for real-for real,
if that's cool with you.

100
00:04:21,548 --> 00:04:23,749
Yeah.

101
00:04:23,751 --> 00:04:25,617
Good.

102
00:04:27,154 --> 00:04:28,620
What you got there?

103
00:04:28,622 --> 00:04:30,288
Math. Big test later
this week.

104
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31,656
Yeah, I know what it's
like switching schools,

105
00:04:31,658 --> 00:04:32,924
but don't worry
about it.

106
00:04:32,926 --> 00:04:34,059
You'll get there.

107
00:04:34,061 --> 00:04:35,927
Not by the end of
this week.

108
00:04:35,929 --> 00:04:37,562
I'll be lucky to get a C.

109
00:04:37,564 --> 00:04:39,297
Nothing wrong with
getting a C every once in a while.

110
00:04:39,299 --> 00:04:41,299
I used to get Ds.
I would've been psyched for a C.

111
00:04:41,301 --> 00:04:42,701
You don't get it.

112
00:04:42,703 --> 00:04:44,503
I am kidding. Just, I
think that if you relax

113
00:04:44,505 --> 00:04:46,037
a little bit more,
it'll come easier.

114
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:48,273
I got to study.
Can I be excused?

115
00:04:48,275 --> 00:04:49,975
Yeah.

116
00:04:49,977 --> 00:04:52,077
- Thanks.
- Yup.

117
00:04:59,653 --> 00:05:01,286
- Hey.
- Hey.

118
00:05:01,288 --> 00:05:02,954
You all right?

119
00:05:02,956 --> 00:05:05,891
Ye--no. William's
stressing over a test.

120
00:05:05,893 --> 00:05:07,759
I tried to be supportive,
and I feel like I just--

121
00:05:07,761 --> 00:05:09,327
I'm--I'm making it worse.

122
00:05:09,329 --> 00:05:11,163
I feel your pain. That
was Dinah's department.

123
00:05:11,165 --> 00:05:13,098
I don't know what
I'd have done parenting alone.

124
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,200
Uh, uh, I mean, you'll
figure it out, though.

125
00:05:15,202 --> 00:05:16,601
Thank you.

126
00:05:19,306 --> 00:05:20,906
Agent Watson,

127
00:05:20,908 --> 00:05:22,808
I do not believe you
are on my schedule.

128
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:25,343
I think you'll come to find
I really don't give a damn.

129
00:05:25,345 --> 00:05:26,344
Ok.

130
00:05:26,346 --> 00:05:28,013
Your office issued
a statement

131
00:05:28,015 --> 00:05:30,348
on last night's
apprehension of Alex Faust.

132
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,617
We did. He was apprehended
by the Green Arrow.

133
00:05:32,619 --> 00:05:34,119
And I'm sure you have
an airtight alibi

134
00:05:34,121 --> 00:05:35,353
for last night.

135
00:05:35,355 --> 00:05:37,022
Rockets game with
my kid.

136
00:05:37,024 --> 00:05:39,124
We were on
the Jumbotron.

137
00:05:39,126 --> 00:05:40,926
And only an idiot
of the highest order would be fooled

138
00:05:40,928 --> 00:05:42,594
by someone else running
around in that hood.

139
00:05:42,596 --> 00:05:44,663
Whoever your understudy is,
he might want to brush up

140
00:05:44,665 --> 00:05:46,231
on his archery.

141
00:05:46,233 --> 00:05:47,699
Or did you think we
didn't notice

142
00:05:47,701 --> 00:05:49,968
that no arrows were used
in taking down Faust?

143
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:51,169
Are you done?

144
00:05:51,171 --> 00:05:52,571
- I'm not.
- Ok.

145
00:05:52,573 --> 00:05:54,206
Whether I can prove
you're the Green Arrow,

146
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:56,274
there's no question you
support him as mayor.

147
00:05:56,276 --> 00:05:58,977
You're known to protect
and communicate with him and his team.

148
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:00,745
Is that a crime?

149
00:06:00,747 --> 00:06:02,414
No. But you're
sending a message

150
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:04,015
to the police of this city

151
00:06:04,017 --> 00:06:07,118
that they can't do their job
without vigilante help.

152
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,322
I'm glad I don't work
for you.

153
00:06:17,531 --> 00:06:18,997
She's not wrong.

154
00:06:18,999 --> 00:06:20,999
Uh, about the "Glad you
don't work for me" part

155
00:06:21,001 --> 00:06:23,568
or the "Nobody's buying
John under the hood" part?

156
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:25,770
The undercutting
the cops part.

157
00:06:25,772 --> 00:06:27,172
I know they're not enough
for this city,

158
00:06:27,174 --> 00:06:28,974
but they never will be
if we keep saying it.

159
00:06:28,976 --> 00:06:30,775
That's a catch-22,
Quentin.

160
00:06:30,777 --> 00:06:32,911
I mean...

161
00:06:32,913 --> 00:06:34,846
Can you try to find
a solution?

162
00:06:34,848 --> 00:06:36,748
Yeah. I'll try.

163
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,083
Thank you.

164
00:06:38,085 --> 00:06:39,818
It'd be nice to have
something

165
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,980
before John and the team have to get
back in the field.

166
00:06:48,428 --> 00:06:50,562
Hey, I'll be back in 5.

167
00:06:54,268 --> 00:06:57,936
Uh, guys?

168
00:06:57,938 --> 00:06:59,804
Yeah, we heard you.
You'll be--

169
00:06:59,806 --> 00:07:01,273
what the...?

170
00:07:39,275 --> 00:07:41,308
Officer Lopez...

171
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:43,344
I hope you don't own
any Kord Industries stock.

172
00:07:43,346 --> 00:07:45,112
My pension fund does,

173
00:07:45,114 --> 00:07:46,947
though it seems a little crass to worry
about that now.

174
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:49,016
What do we got?

175
00:07:49,018 --> 00:07:50,417
The vics all died of broken vertebrae
or blunt force trauma.

176
00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:52,419
- Forensics?
- Not even a fingerprint.

177
00:07:52,421 --> 00:07:54,088
And speaking of,
the unsub used

178
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:55,689
one of the vic's palm
prints to gain access

179
00:07:55,691 --> 00:07:57,358
into Kord's
internal server.

180
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,759
To get what?

181
00:07:58,761 --> 00:08:00,027
The company doesn't
know yet.

182
00:08:00,029 --> 00:08:01,896
I'm gonna need a chat
with the CEO.

183
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:04,265
In the meantime, I'm gonna
take a look around here.

184
00:08:07,837 --> 00:08:10,838
- You get all that?
- Yeah, and a bag of chips.

185
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,473
Sorry. I didn't get a chance to eat
breakfast this morning.

186
00:08:12,475 --> 00:08:14,475
I'm feeling
a little peckish.

187
00:08:14,477 --> 00:08:16,410
Ten will get you 20 that Kord's CEO
won't tell you anything.

188
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:17,478
Can you
access the server?

189
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,313
Already here. Now what?

190
00:08:19,315 --> 00:08:20,915
Ok, you're looking
for a master port.

191
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,017
It's female with
a yellow border.

192
00:08:23,019 --> 00:08:24,885
Got it.

193
00:08:24,887 --> 00:08:26,187
Ok, insert our toy

194
00:08:26,189 --> 00:08:27,521
and let us do
our thang.

195
00:08:27,523 --> 00:08:29,657
You keep saying
"thing" wrong.

196
00:08:31,961 --> 00:08:33,994
All right. We're in.
Curtis has got it from here.

197
00:08:33,996 --> 00:08:35,496
You going somewhere?

198
00:08:35,498 --> 00:08:37,064
Yeah, I got startup
work to do.

199
00:08:37,066 --> 00:08:38,906
Yeah, we're still trying
to decide on our name.

200
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:43,070
Hey, so I think
I have a solution

201
00:08:43,072 --> 00:08:44,705
to our cop's catch-22.

202
00:08:44,707 --> 00:08:46,307
That was fast.

203
00:08:46,309 --> 00:08:48,742
I was chatting with
councilwoman Pollard.

204
00:08:48,744 --> 00:08:50,344
She's in the early
stages of drafting

205
00:08:50,346 --> 00:08:52,246
some anti-vigilante
legislation.

206
00:08:52,248 --> 00:08:53,347
No.

207
00:08:53,349 --> 00:08:54,548
Hear me out.

208
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,883
If you were to join
it, sponsor it...

209
00:08:55,885 --> 00:08:57,651
Still, no.

210
00:08:57,653 --> 00:08:58,953
You could tailor the bill to however
you want it, all right?

211
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,521
You could take
the teeth out of it

212
00:09:00,523 --> 00:09:02,156
so it can't
bite the team too hard.

213
00:09:02,158 --> 00:09:04,058
Ok, first, Pollard
is not a pushover,

214
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,693
so we know this isn't true.

215
00:09:05,695 --> 00:09:08,662
Second, I am not going
to put John in the hood

216
00:09:08,664 --> 00:09:10,331
and then actively support
legislation

217
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,233
that further brands him
a criminal.

218
00:09:12,235 --> 00:09:14,535
Find another way, please.

219
00:09:21,577 --> 00:09:23,510
- Hi.
- Hey.

220
00:09:23,512 --> 00:09:25,713
Um, city hall is
6 blocks that way.

221
00:09:25,715 --> 00:09:27,381
I thought maybe you
could use

222
00:09:27,383 --> 00:09:28,949
a late afternoon
snack.

223
00:09:28,951 --> 00:09:30,217
Who are you, my mother?

224
00:09:30,219 --> 00:09:31,685
I mean, that's not
even accurate.

225
00:09:31,687 --> 00:09:33,220
My mother rarely remembered
to pick me up from school,

226
00:09:33,222 --> 00:09:34,755
let alone make me a snack.

227
00:09:36,792 --> 00:09:37,891
May I come in?

228
00:09:37,893 --> 00:09:40,427
Yeah. Yeah.

229
00:09:41,964 --> 00:09:44,965
I, uh, love what you've
done with the place.

230
00:09:44,967 --> 00:09:46,934
Yeah, well, you know,

231
00:09:46,936 --> 00:09:50,037
it's near impossible
to find affordable office space

232
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:51,372
in the city.

233
00:09:51,374 --> 00:09:53,007
Someone should talk to
the mayor about that.

234
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,742
Oh, speaking of,
how do you feel

235
00:09:54,744 --> 00:09:59,013
about the name
"Bit By Bit"?

236
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,915
Sounds like a sitcom
from the eighties.

237
00:10:01,917 --> 00:10:04,618
Great. That's, like,
really not what we're going for.

238
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,787
Well, who knew that
when you

239
00:10:06,789 --> 00:10:08,555
stopped balancing
being vigilante

240
00:10:08,557 --> 00:10:10,991
with everything else
that you would have time

241
00:10:10,993 --> 00:10:13,661
to drop off snacks?

242
00:10:13,663 --> 00:10:15,462
Speaking off, how is
William now that you're

243
00:10:15,464 --> 00:10:17,298
done pulling double
vigilante/daddy duty?

244
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,766
It's a two steps
forward,

245
00:10:18,768 --> 00:10:20,768
one step backwards
sort of thing.

246
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:22,369
I was just thinking,

247
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:24,571
I'd really love to lean
on Thea, but, um,

248
00:10:24,573 --> 00:10:26,440
I mean, she
just has a knack

249
00:10:26,442 --> 00:10:28,275
for this sort of thing.

250
00:10:28,277 --> 00:10:30,511
Yeah, she'd be the most
bad-ass aunt ever.

251
00:10:30,513 --> 00:10:31,812
Would she ever.

252
00:10:31,814 --> 00:10:33,213
Well, I know I'm not Thea,

253
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:34,982
but I am so down to help
in any way that you need.

254
00:10:34,984 --> 00:10:37,217
Well, truth be told,
aside from snacks,

255
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:39,420
I do sort of need
your help.

256
00:10:39,422 --> 00:10:40,788
Ah.

257
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:42,823
William has a math test
later this week

258
00:10:42,825 --> 00:10:44,458
that he's really
stressing out over,

259
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:47,828
and, um, every time
I open my mouth,

260
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:49,496
I am making it worse.

261
00:10:49,498 --> 00:10:51,131
So the man who took down
Damien Darhk is bested

262
00:10:51,133 --> 00:10:52,766
by arithmetic.

263
00:10:52,768 --> 00:10:54,201
It wasn't my strongest
subject in school.

264
00:10:54,203 --> 00:10:55,502
No? What was, truancy?

265
00:10:55,504 --> 00:10:57,671
Charm.

266
00:10:57,673 --> 00:11:00,607
Yeah, no doubt.

267
00:11:00,609 --> 00:11:02,843
Let me guess, you told him
something along the lines of,

268
00:11:02,845 --> 00:11:05,179
"Just relax. I would've
been psyched to get a C.

269
00:11:05,181 --> 00:11:06,447
All I got was Fs."

270
00:11:06,449 --> 00:11:08,248
Ds. I most--

271
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,150
How did
you know that?

272
00:11:10,152 --> 00:11:11,585
Because I know you,

273
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:13,487
and I know that if you
even cared about school,

274
00:11:13,489 --> 00:11:14,988
you would've been good
at it.

275
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:16,457
Thank you.

276
00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:18,092
Nothing would grind my gears
more when I was his age

277
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:20,427
when my mom was just telling
me to stop worrying

278
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:22,529
when I was freaking out
about a project.

279
00:11:22,531 --> 00:11:23,864
Why?

280
00:11:23,866 --> 00:11:25,666
I didn't need
to learn how to relax.

281
00:11:25,668 --> 00:11:27,034
I needed to figure out
how to do the work.

282
00:11:27,036 --> 00:11:29,169
So what do I do?
What d--

283
00:11:29,171 --> 00:11:32,506
Well, ask him--ask him
what he needs,

284
00:11:32,508 --> 00:11:34,174
and then put him
in the driver's seat,

285
00:11:34,176 --> 00:11:35,843
and he'll show you
how to help him.

286
00:11:37,046 --> 00:11:39,346
You make things
so simple.

287
00:11:39,348 --> 00:11:41,315
You always have.

288
00:11:41,317 --> 00:11:42,516
Huh.

289
00:11:45,988 --> 00:11:47,654
Curtis?

290
00:11:47,656 --> 00:11:49,990
No wonder Kord doesn't like
to share their secrets.

291
00:11:49,992 --> 00:11:52,359
They invent a lot of
really nasty stuff,

292
00:11:52,361 --> 00:11:55,028
including this new
military grade nerve gas ZX.

293
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:57,131
What does that have
to do with our mystery killer woman?

294
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,833
She downloaded
the transport schedule for said nerve gas.

295
00:11:59,835 --> 00:12:01,769
Now, do you find that
alarming, or is it just me?

296
00:12:01,771 --> 00:12:03,704
No. I definitely find that alarming.
When is it moving?

297
00:12:03,706 --> 00:12:05,105
One hour.

298
00:12:05,107 --> 00:12:06,407
Ok. I'm on my way.
Alert the Green Arrow.

299
00:12:06,409 --> 00:12:08,308
Well, I mean Diggle.
I mean John.

300
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,077
I mean, it's just good OPSEC to use
code names in the field.

301
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,779
I agree. Go.

302
00:12:22,358 --> 00:12:23,857
You know, if you're not
going to say anything,

303
00:12:23,859 --> 00:12:25,459
you can at least turn on
the damn radio.

304
00:12:25,461 --> 00:12:28,462
With your presets?
I'd prefer the silence.

305
00:12:28,464 --> 00:12:31,565
Just turn it on.

306
00:12:37,273 --> 00:12:41,842
♪ children of Aquarius ♪

307
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:44,278
♪ your world is
my world ♪

308
00:12:47,783 --> 00:12:49,349
It's not safe on the road.

309
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:51,985
That's what he's for.

310
00:12:51,987 --> 00:12:53,921
My team's more equipped.

311
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:01,895
♪ children of Aquarius ♪

312
00:13:01,897 --> 00:13:04,131

313
00:13:04,133 --> 00:13:06,733
You have horrible taste
in music.

314
00:13:08,604 --> 00:13:10,170
Why are we slowing down?

315
00:13:10,172 --> 00:13:11,772
I don't know.

316
00:13:13,309 --> 00:13:14,942
Stay here.

317
00:13:19,448 --> 00:13:21,315
Overwatch.
Any bogies on thermal?

318
00:13:21,317 --> 00:13:22,983
Just you guys.

319
00:13:22,985 --> 00:13:24,685
And I'm guessing
you're not bogies.

320
00:13:24,687 --> 00:13:26,220
What's going on, guys?
Why aren't you moving?

321
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,155
I'm trying to find
that out right now.

322
00:13:32,595 --> 00:13:33,794
Perfect.

323
00:13:33,796 --> 00:13:35,262
Ignition blocker.

324
00:13:45,341 --> 00:13:48,842
Surprise, bitch.

325
00:13:48,844 --> 00:13:52,479
Careful. Bullets
and bioweapons don't mix.

326
00:13:52,481 --> 00:13:54,548
Your friend's right.

327
00:14:00,523 --> 00:14:02,189
Hyah!

328
00:14:32,588 --> 00:14:34,254
Leader's in the cab, Hoss.

329
00:14:34,256 --> 00:14:35,923
Go after her or the gas?

330
00:14:35,925 --> 00:14:37,891
Or both?

331
00:14:39,261 --> 00:14:41,995
They're getting away, Hoss.
Make a decision!

332
00:14:45,267 --> 00:14:46,700
Screw this.

333
00:15:03,786 --> 00:15:06,720
Couldn't get to it.
Couldn't stop her.

334
00:15:06,722 --> 00:15:09,256
It wasn't
your fault.

335
00:15:20,814 --> 00:15:22,280
What the hell happened
out there?

336
00:15:22,781 --> 00:15:25,815
Ask him.
Dude just froze.

337
00:15:27,252 --> 00:15:28,684
Casualties?

338
00:15:28,686 --> 00:15:29,886
No. Everyone got out.

339
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:31,687
A dozen people were sent
to the hospital

340
00:15:31,689 --> 00:15:33,189
for smoke inhalation,

341
00:15:33,191 --> 00:15:35,992
and two are
in critical condition.

342
00:15:35,994 --> 00:15:37,360
What the hell, Hoss?

343
00:15:37,362 --> 00:15:39,262
There were two targets
and two of us.

344
00:15:39,264 --> 00:15:41,230
What was
so freakin' complicated?

345
00:15:43,501 --> 00:15:45,201
I don't know. That's
never happened to me

346
00:15:45,203 --> 00:15:46,669
in the field before,

347
00:15:46,671 --> 00:15:49,539
not in the army
and not with this team.

348
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:51,240
The fog of war.

349
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:52,608
Things don't always
go perfect out there,

350
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:56,045
so we close ranks
and we move on.

351
00:15:57,015 --> 00:15:58,748
Thanks.

352
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,883
It won't happen again.

353
00:16:00,885 --> 00:16:02,485
Ok. Good,

354
00:16:02,487 --> 00:16:05,388
'cause it looks like
you guys got another shot

355
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:07,089
at these guys.

356
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:10,226
Facial recog came back
with a match.

357
00:16:10,228 --> 00:16:14,063
Onyx Adams, leader of
a CIA black Ops squad

358
00:16:14,065 --> 00:16:15,865
working undercover in Syria.

359
00:16:15,867 --> 00:16:17,900
They disappeared in 2015
with $100 million

360
00:16:17,902 --> 00:16:19,535
in Syrian government gold.

361
00:16:19,537 --> 00:16:21,037
And what have they
been doing since?

362
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:23,105
My guess is preparing
for the ZX gas heist.

363
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:25,041
And finding the tech
they need to do it.

364
00:16:25,043 --> 00:16:27,376
Why weren't they blinded by
the flashbangs like we were?

365
00:16:27,378 --> 00:16:29,679
Also, if these guys got away
with 100 million in gold,

366
00:16:29,681 --> 00:16:32,014
why would they risk it by
trying to steal nerve gas?

367
00:16:32,016 --> 00:16:34,383
Fine. See if you can pick up any chatter
on the dark web--

368
00:16:34,385 --> 00:16:35,651
encrypted message
boards, whatever.

369
00:16:35,653 --> 00:16:36,853
I'll check with Lyla,

370
00:16:36,855 --> 00:16:39,088
see if any Intel
has changed.

371
00:16:41,726 --> 00:16:43,793
Also, I'm sorry
about tonight.

372
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:45,695
That wasn't me.

373
00:16:45,697 --> 00:16:50,166
Hey. When I said move on,
I meant you, too.

374
00:16:58,076 --> 00:17:00,643
Fortunately, the two victims
in critical condition

375
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:02,512
are expected to recover.

376
00:17:02,514 --> 00:17:04,080
Multiple witnesses spotted

377
00:17:04,082 --> 00:17:07,917
Green Arrow and his team
of vigilantes at the scene.

378
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:12,922
Becky, can you get

379
00:17:12,924 --> 00:17:14,457
the fire chief's latest
report, please?

380
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:16,325
And could--would you mind
putting in an order

381
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:17,627
for some coffee?

382
00:17:17,629 --> 00:17:20,696
One of the big boxes
of coffee, please.

383
00:17:20,698 --> 00:17:22,632
Thank you.

384
00:17:27,605 --> 00:17:29,171
So I guess being
the Green Arrow involves

385
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,973
something of
a learning curve.

386
00:17:30,975 --> 00:17:33,509
We don't know the circumstances
surrounding last night.

387
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:34,810
Yeah, but we know how
it's gonna play out.

388
00:17:35,813 --> 00:17:36,846
What do you mean?

389
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:38,347
Heh! Wow.
Speak of the devil.

390
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:39,849
Got to admire
her sense of timing.

391
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:41,317
- Who?
- Pollard.

392
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:42,585
She's seizing
the moment.

393
00:17:42,587 --> 00:17:44,120
She's using last
night's disaster

394
00:17:44,122 --> 00:17:45,721
as a pretext to
introduce

395
00:17:45,723 --> 00:17:48,090
her anti-vigilante
legislation to the council.

396
00:17:48,092 --> 00:17:49,659
- Does she have the votes?
- I don't know.

397
00:17:49,661 --> 00:17:51,360
Can you make sure
she doesn't?

398
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,172
Hey.

399
00:18:04,309 --> 00:18:06,242
Can we talk for a second?

400
00:18:09,147 --> 00:18:10,846
I just wanted to say
thank you

401
00:18:10,848 --> 00:18:12,548
for having my back
with the team.

402
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:15,151
Now, truth be told,
I, um...

403
00:18:15,153 --> 00:18:17,153
I was a bit surprised
considering you--

404
00:18:17,155 --> 00:18:18,821
Well, don't be
surprised.

405
00:18:18,823 --> 00:18:20,556
And don't think I said
what I said for you.

406
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:23,859
I said it because this
team needs a leader.

407
00:18:23,861 --> 00:18:25,394
Without
a chain of command,

408
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:27,196
we're easy pickings
out there.

409
00:18:28,433 --> 00:18:31,000
Ok. I guess
that's why you decided

410
00:18:31,002 --> 00:18:33,603
not to tell anyone
about my injury, right?

411
00:18:33,605 --> 00:18:35,171
It is.

412
00:18:35,173 --> 00:18:36,739
But, honestly,
as worried as I am

413
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:38,441
about your hand,
after last night,

414
00:18:38,443 --> 00:18:40,209
I'm a little more
worried about your head.

415
00:18:40,211 --> 00:18:41,911
I know.

416
00:18:41,913 --> 00:18:44,614
Hey, Dinah, I know.

417
00:18:46,217 --> 00:18:49,051
Look...

418
00:18:49,053 --> 00:18:50,853
Every time I've had
to give orders

419
00:18:50,855 --> 00:18:53,823
in the army,
on this team,

420
00:18:53,825 --> 00:18:56,225
there was always
someone there

421
00:18:56,227 --> 00:18:58,027
backing my plays.

422
00:18:59,864 --> 00:19:03,065
I'm not used to making
the hard calls alone.

423
00:19:03,067 --> 00:19:05,468
No one is more
disappointed in me

424
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:07,169
than me.

425
00:19:07,171 --> 00:19:09,071
Well, next time,
get it right.

426
00:19:09,073 --> 00:19:11,974
Our lives depend on it.

427
00:19:13,211 --> 00:19:15,282
She shoots, she scores!

428
00:19:15,283 --> 00:19:16,849
What do we have?

429
00:19:16,851 --> 00:19:19,419
Ok, these are our
new friends back in 2015.

430
00:19:19,421 --> 00:19:21,621
But last night, you said
there were only 5.

431
00:19:21,623 --> 00:19:22,822
You think when that
leader went rogue,

432
00:19:22,824 --> 00:19:24,023
not everyone went
with her.

433
00:19:24,025 --> 00:19:25,191
Woof. Wild Dog for the win.

434
00:19:25,193 --> 00:19:26,793
Three of
her original members

435
00:19:26,795 --> 00:19:28,595
defected back to the CIA
for a little while at least.

436
00:19:28,597 --> 00:19:30,830
What do you mean,
for a little while?

437
00:19:30,832 --> 00:19:32,198
Ok, 'cause this guy and
this guy were both killed

438
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,633
in separate poison gas
attacks last year,

439
00:19:33,635 --> 00:19:35,001
one in Mosul,
one in Tripoli.

440
00:19:35,003 --> 00:19:36,636
The video footage is...

441
00:19:36,638 --> 00:19:38,071
it's--it's really gruesome.

442
00:19:38,259 --> 00:19:39,992
Well, poison gas
can't be a coincidence.

443
00:19:39,994 --> 00:19:41,994
No. I mean, ISIS is
linked to both of them,

444
00:19:41,996 --> 00:19:43,929
but I'm pretty sure this is how Onyx likes
to solve her problems.

445
00:19:43,931 --> 00:19:46,231
So she staged two terrorist attacks
just to settle a grudge?

446
00:19:46,233 --> 00:19:47,933
No, not just a grudge.

447
00:19:47,935 --> 00:19:49,768
These are the only two
that can pin her to the stolen gold.

448
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:51,203
Bingo.

449
00:19:51,205 --> 00:19:52,704
All right. So she's
wiping out defectors.

450
00:19:52,706 --> 00:19:54,540
Got one left--rob Reynolds,
whereabouts unknown.

451
00:19:54,542 --> 00:19:56,442
Yeah, but you got to figure Star City
or somewhere close by.

452
00:19:56,444 --> 00:19:58,143
Well, I'm
guessing we should worry

453
00:19:58,145 --> 00:19:59,711
what this gas could do
to a populated area.

454
00:19:59,713 --> 00:20:02,614
Oh, yeah. Look.

455
00:20:16,697 --> 00:20:18,363
Hey, buddy.

456
00:20:18,365 --> 00:20:19,598
Hi.

457
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,266
How's it going?

458
00:20:22,803 --> 00:20:24,236
Fine.

459
00:20:24,238 --> 00:20:25,904
You still worried
about the test?

460
00:20:25,906 --> 00:20:27,239
Yeah.

461
00:20:27,241 --> 00:20:30,275
Anything that I
can do to help?

462
00:20:30,277 --> 00:20:33,579
Uh, do you know
quadratic equations?

463
00:20:33,581 --> 00:20:38,484
Wow! Um, those sound
vaguely familiar,

464
00:20:38,486 --> 00:20:40,385
but then again, I wasn't
the most enthusiastic

465
00:20:40,387 --> 00:20:42,221
math student, so...

466
00:20:42,223 --> 00:20:44,590
I really shouldn't be
talking

467
00:20:44,592 --> 00:20:46,725
to anyone who can't
help me right now.

468
00:20:46,727 --> 00:20:47,926
Ok.

469
00:20:55,503 --> 00:20:57,302
Got a minute, Hoss?

470
00:20:57,304 --> 00:20:58,904
Sure.

471
00:21:05,379 --> 00:21:08,013
This about Pollard's bill?

472
00:21:08,015 --> 00:21:09,515
No. Uh, sorry. I...

473
00:21:09,517 --> 00:21:11,717
I've been out of
the office.

474
00:21:11,719 --> 00:21:13,485
No, this is
about John.

475
00:21:13,487 --> 00:21:15,053
What about him?

476
00:21:15,055 --> 00:21:16,955
It's not working out.

477
00:21:16,957 --> 00:21:18,156
You talking
about last night?

478
00:21:18,158 --> 00:21:19,358
I'm talking about
something--

479
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,993
I'm talking about

480
00:21:20,995 --> 00:21:22,060
something a hell of
a lot worse

481
00:21:22,062 --> 00:21:23,729
than what happened
last night.

482
00:21:23,731 --> 00:21:25,864
That poison gas
could kill thousands.

483
00:21:25,866 --> 00:21:27,566
John can handle it.

484
00:21:27,568 --> 00:21:29,568
That's why I'm here,
Hoss.

485
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:32,704
He can't. He's in
over his head.

486
00:21:32,706 --> 00:21:34,540
We're lucky nobody
died last night,

487
00:21:34,542 --> 00:21:36,542
but luck runs out.

488
00:21:38,112 --> 00:21:40,212
We need you
to come back.

489
00:21:48,021 --> 00:21:50,546
I'm still working on
a 20 with Reynolds.

490
00:21:50,702 --> 00:21:52,001
It's gonna take a while.

491
00:21:52,003 --> 00:21:54,137
These black Op guys are
really hard to find.

492
00:21:54,139 --> 00:21:55,705
Hey.

493
00:21:55,707 --> 00:21:58,608
Hey. Wow.

494
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,510
I'm just surprised
to see you here,

495
00:22:00,512 --> 00:22:02,045
and I'm also surprised
that you remembered the access code.

496
00:22:02,047 --> 00:22:03,179
It's been, like, a week.

497
00:22:03,181 --> 00:22:05,882
- Yeah. It was--it was a joke.
- Ok.

498
00:22:05,884 --> 00:22:07,317
I'm guessing
you're here for--

499
00:22:08,486 --> 00:22:10,486
Well, yeah, and the guy

500
00:22:10,488 --> 00:22:12,522
that you're searching
for, this Reynolds.

501
00:22:12,524 --> 00:22:14,157
- Yeah.
- Can Curtis handle it?

502
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:15,592
Yeah. I'm sure he can.
Why? What do you need?

503
00:22:15,594 --> 00:22:17,460
Well, I asked William
what he needs,

504
00:22:17,462 --> 00:22:20,129
and he needs a tutor.

505
00:22:20,131 --> 00:22:22,565
Aw. Lucky for you
and for him,

506
00:22:22,567 --> 00:22:24,133
you are looking
at Nevada's

507
00:22:24,135 --> 00:22:26,870
3-time state
mathletics champion.

508
00:22:26,872 --> 00:22:28,204
Only 3 times?

509
00:22:28,206 --> 00:22:29,405
Yeah, they wouldn't let
freshmen enter.

510
00:22:29,407 --> 00:22:30,874
It was an ordeal.

511
00:22:30,876 --> 00:22:32,375
I got over it,
but it still kind of hurts.

512
00:22:32,377 --> 00:22:34,277
This can't interfere
with an operation.

513
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:35,578
No. We're in
a holding pattern.

514
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,146
I'm sure Curtis
can come and cover me.

515
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:38,815
I might have
to leave abruptly,

516
00:22:38,817 --> 00:22:40,550
but other than that, yeah.
No, it's not a problem.

517
00:22:40,552 --> 00:22:42,051
Well, I'll probably see you back there.
I'm gonna...

518
00:22:42,053 --> 00:22:44,053
Ok. Yeah. Ok, yeah.

519
00:22:44,055 --> 00:22:46,589
Yeah, I'll call Curtis.
He'll be here soon.

520
00:22:46,591 --> 00:22:48,825
Ok. Ok, bye. Bye.

521
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:56,032
This is weird.

522
00:22:56,034 --> 00:22:57,533
Being back down here?

523
00:22:57,535 --> 00:22:59,202
How many times have
you come down here

524
00:22:59,204 --> 00:23:01,104
to find me brooding?

525
00:23:01,106 --> 00:23:02,906
Well, I'm not brooding,
Oliver. I'm thinking.

526
00:23:02,908 --> 00:23:05,241
Yeah.

527
00:23:07,212 --> 00:23:09,112
Ok, maybe I'm brooding
a little bit.

528
00:23:09,114 --> 00:23:12,282
Well, if you haven't
figured it out already,

529
00:23:12,284 --> 00:23:14,417
that expression is
as much a part of the uniform

530
00:23:14,419 --> 00:23:16,019
as the green hood.

531
00:23:16,021 --> 00:23:18,021
Every time you were down
here brooding,

532
00:23:18,023 --> 00:23:21,524
it was because you made
some kind of mistake.

533
00:23:23,561 --> 00:23:24,961
I think you made
another one, man.

534
00:23:24,963 --> 00:23:27,196
No. Not even close.

535
00:23:27,198 --> 00:23:29,365
Who came to you? Rene?

536
00:23:29,367 --> 00:23:32,602
I needed to come and
ask Felicity a favor.

537
00:23:32,604 --> 00:23:34,404
And then, of course,
I saw

538
00:23:34,406 --> 00:23:36,539
that very familiar
expression.

539
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:38,608
It makes me wonder
if maybe I asked too much of you.

540
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:40,009
What do you mean?

541
00:23:40,011 --> 00:23:42,412
I gave up being
the Green Arrow for William,

542
00:23:42,414 --> 00:23:46,683
but you have J.J.,
you have Lyla.

543
00:23:46,685 --> 00:23:48,584
It doesn't exactly
seem fair.

544
00:23:48,586 --> 00:23:50,453
That's not the issue
at all, Oliver.

545
00:23:50,455 --> 00:23:53,289
I made my peace with this
whole life a long time ago.

546
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:54,791
So what's the problem?

547
00:23:54,793 --> 00:23:57,226
I don't know how you did it.

548
00:23:57,228 --> 00:24:00,430
You never hesitated
to make the call.

549
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,766
You were always sure.
I'm not.

550
00:24:03,768 --> 00:24:08,071
I was never sure,
not one time.

551
00:24:08,073 --> 00:24:11,908
I'm very flattered that
it--it looked that way on the outside,

552
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:14,010
but on the inside,
it was...

553
00:24:14,012 --> 00:24:15,645
It was instinct.

554
00:24:15,647 --> 00:24:17,647
It was instinct,
and it was fear.

555
00:24:17,649 --> 00:24:19,115
Yeah, but you worked
past it.

556
00:24:19,117 --> 00:24:20,984
Well, you'll work
past it, too.

557
00:24:20,986 --> 00:24:22,185
Now, I'm not gonna
sit here and say

558
00:24:22,187 --> 00:24:25,121
that you
won't make mistakes,

559
00:24:25,123 --> 00:24:28,091
that you won't lose
people along the way.

560
00:24:28,093 --> 00:24:31,661
You know, most--most
will be strangers,

561
00:24:31,663 --> 00:24:33,096
but some...

562
00:24:34,766 --> 00:24:36,366
well, some won't be.

563
00:24:36,368 --> 00:24:40,470
Because, John, you're
one of the main reasons

564
00:24:40,472 --> 00:24:43,940
that the Green Arrow
even exists.

565
00:24:43,942 --> 00:24:45,141
What are you talking about?

566
00:24:45,143 --> 00:24:46,442
The Restons.

567
00:24:46,444 --> 00:24:49,178
- The bank robbers?
- The bank robbers, yeah.

568
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:51,314
You were the first
person who convinced me

569
00:24:51,316 --> 00:24:52,949
to look past

570
00:24:52,951 --> 00:24:56,152
just the names on
my father's list.

571
00:24:56,154 --> 00:24:58,221
You helped me discover
that the hood--

572
00:24:58,223 --> 00:24:59,822
that persona--he wasn't
a hero.

573
00:24:59,824 --> 00:25:01,858
You--you helped me
find one.

574
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,426
All of this--
the Green Arrow,

575
00:25:03,428 --> 00:25:05,928
the idea of it--
it exists

576
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:08,364
because you had faith
in me.

577
00:25:11,336 --> 00:25:12,702
Now you got to have

578
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:14,971
the same kind of faith
in yourself.

579
00:25:14,973 --> 00:25:16,906
Because if you do...

580
00:25:20,945 --> 00:25:23,946
You can be
a better leader.

581
00:25:23,948 --> 00:25:25,982
You can be
a better hero

582
00:25:25,984 --> 00:25:28,551
than I ever was.

583
00:25:41,332 --> 00:25:43,599
- Sitrep.
- Good to go.

584
00:25:43,601 --> 00:25:44,967
Any doubts?

585
00:25:44,969 --> 00:25:46,836
You ask that
each time?

586
00:25:46,838 --> 00:25:50,373
Because we are going
after our brothers in arms,

587
00:25:50,375 --> 00:25:52,008
comrades.

588
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:53,676
I need your resolve.

589
00:25:53,678 --> 00:25:56,679
You got it. And tonight
Reynolds gets his.

590
00:25:56,681 --> 00:25:57,847
Roger that.

591
00:25:57,849 --> 00:26:00,216
What about
the Green Arrow?

592
00:26:00,218 --> 00:26:02,251
What about him?

593
00:26:02,253 --> 00:26:03,986
You've seen him
in the field.

594
00:26:03,988 --> 00:26:05,888
Being highly trained
operators,

595
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:07,523
would you consider him
a threat?

596
00:26:07,525 --> 00:26:10,860
- Hell no.
- There's your answer. Move out.

597
00:26:13,364 --> 00:26:15,398
Ok, and after you
divide by x...

598
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,034
Uh, solve for x.

599
00:26:18,036 --> 00:26:19,769
Yes, but first...

600
00:26:19,771 --> 00:26:22,805
Is it factor
the binomials?

601
00:26:22,807 --> 00:26:24,807
Yeah, right. Cool.

602
00:26:24,809 --> 00:26:26,909
But why can't I just
solve for x?

603
00:26:26,911 --> 00:26:28,144
Oh, you will,
I mean, eventually,

604
00:26:28,146 --> 00:26:29,712
probably in high school,

605
00:26:29,714 --> 00:26:32,248
but first you have
to master the binomials.

606
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:33,783
Oh, I'm gonna bomb this.

607
00:26:33,785 --> 00:26:36,219
I know it sucks because
you're new

608
00:26:36,221 --> 00:26:38,221
and probably
a little behind,

609
00:26:38,223 --> 00:26:40,389
but the fact that you're
frustrated means

610
00:26:40,391 --> 00:26:42,825
that you can see how useful
math could be,

611
00:26:42,827 --> 00:26:47,563
which means, unfortunately,
you're really good at it.

612
00:26:49,033 --> 00:26:52,135
Oliver said school doesn't matter
in the real world.

613
00:26:52,137 --> 00:26:55,104
Hmm, well, Oliver didn't
grow up in the real world.

614
00:26:55,106 --> 00:26:57,740
School changed my life.

615
00:26:57,742 --> 00:26:59,408
I used to love school.

616
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:02,612
Yeah. You will again,
promise.

617
00:27:05,383 --> 00:27:07,450
How's it going in here?

618
00:27:07,452 --> 00:27:08,885
Good.

619
00:27:08,887 --> 00:27:10,253
Yeah, I'd say we're
making progress.

620
00:27:10,255 --> 00:27:11,988
Good.

621
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:14,090
Could you tutor me some
more before the test?

622
00:27:14,092 --> 00:27:16,325
Um, yeah. I mean, if it's
cool with your dad,

623
00:27:16,327 --> 00:27:17,927
it's cool with me.

624
00:27:17,929 --> 00:27:20,530
If it's cool with you,
it's totally cool with me.

625
00:27:24,369 --> 00:27:26,969
Special delivery.

626
00:27:26,971 --> 00:27:28,905
Hey, that's not
grilled cheese.

627
00:27:28,907 --> 00:27:30,173
No, it's not
grilled cheese.

628
00:27:30,175 --> 00:27:31,541
Those are Monte Cristos.

629
00:27:31,543 --> 00:27:33,342
What's a Monte Cristo?

630
00:27:33,344 --> 00:27:34,844
What? You've never had--

631
00:27:34,846 --> 00:27:37,914
this is the best nighttime
snack you can ever have,

632
00:27:37,916 --> 00:27:39,482
and you used waffles.

633
00:27:39,484 --> 00:27:42,518
Well, that is how we do it
in the not real world.

634
00:27:45,657 --> 00:27:48,491
Curtis got a location
on Reynolds. We gotta--

635
00:27:48,493 --> 00:27:50,793
Well, I gotta--ha ha!--Go.

636
00:27:50,795 --> 00:27:51,827
This is--without you,
it's weird.

637
00:27:51,829 --> 00:27:53,062
Best of luck out there.

638
00:27:53,064 --> 00:27:54,363
Oh, I'll be in
the bunker for this.

639
00:27:54,365 --> 00:27:55,865
William, you're awesome.

640
00:27:55,867 --> 00:27:58,067
- Thank you.
- See you soon.

641
00:27:59,704 --> 00:28:02,205
She's pretty cool.

642
00:28:02,207 --> 00:28:04,073
Yeah, she is.

643
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:06,475
Traffic cams picked up
Reynolds

644
00:28:06,477 --> 00:28:07,977
heading north
on Hillcrest.

645
00:28:07,979 --> 00:28:09,178
The only things
out there are

646
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,746
souvenirs
and the Haselby Grand.

647
00:28:10,748 --> 00:28:12,481
A hotel's a great
place for an ex-spook

648
00:28:12,483 --> 00:28:14,217
to stash a go-bag
and try to slip out

649
00:28:14,219 --> 00:28:15,885
with the tourist
crowd.

650
00:28:15,887 --> 00:28:17,486
Huh. It makes you wonder if
his old crew tipped him off

651
00:28:17,488 --> 00:28:19,188
or he's just the luckiest
target in the world.

652
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:21,457
Either way, there are
hundreds of people in that hotel,

653
00:28:21,459 --> 00:28:23,292
so if they disperse
the gas--

654
00:28:23,294 --> 00:28:25,194
They won't.
Let's move out.

655
00:28:25,196 --> 00:28:28,564
Did he forget
to say "suit up,"

656
00:28:28,566 --> 00:28:30,733
or was "let's move,"
like, his version of "suit up."

657
00:28:30,735 --> 00:28:32,301
Because, personally,
I like "let's suit up,"

658
00:28:32,303 --> 00:28:33,703
'cause then it just lets
you know that you...

659
00:28:33,705 --> 00:28:35,037
Go suit up, Curtis.

660
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:36,906
Yeah, I have
to go suit up. Ahem.

661
00:28:38,743 --> 00:28:40,409
Hey, hey.

662
00:28:41,546 --> 00:28:43,346
Can you handle this?

663
00:28:45,416 --> 00:28:47,550
I asked Oliver to come back.

664
00:28:47,552 --> 00:28:49,385
Well, the fact that he
didn't should tell you something, right?

665
00:28:49,387 --> 00:28:50,853
Maybe.

666
00:28:50,855 --> 00:28:52,755
Look, all I know for sure,

667
00:28:52,757 --> 00:28:54,757
if John doesn't straighten
himself out,

668
00:28:54,759 --> 00:28:56,926
it's gonna be
another rough night.

669
00:29:16,957 --> 00:29:18,266
I got eyes on the tango.

670
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:20,237
Roger that

671
00:29:20,239 --> 00:29:22,627
Package is deployed.

672
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,966
What do we know, Overwatch?

673
00:29:27,968 --> 00:29:29,635
Lots. Thermal reads

674
00:29:29,637 --> 00:29:31,837
a potential 166
casualties inside,

675
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:33,839
and Onyx's team cut
the CCTV.

676
00:29:33,841 --> 00:29:35,507
So we're going in blind.

677
00:29:35,509 --> 00:29:37,476
Literally if we get hit
with those flashbangs of hers again.

678
00:29:37,478 --> 00:29:39,545
Your dorky-ass glasses
better work.

679
00:30:03,604 --> 00:30:05,604
Got visuals thanks to
Mr. Terrific's T-spheres.

680
00:30:05,606 --> 00:30:07,005
Go now.

681
00:30:20,254 --> 00:30:22,154
We need locations on
Reynolds and the gas.

682
00:30:22,156 --> 00:30:23,388
I have him,
upper lobby,

683
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:24,857
but I got no way of
detecting the gas.

684
00:30:24,859 --> 00:30:26,792
Canary, terrific, see if
you can locate the gas.

685
00:30:26,794 --> 00:30:28,327
Dog, you're
with me on evac

686
00:30:28,329 --> 00:30:29,895
after we clear
Reynolds.

687
00:30:29,897 --> 00:30:31,296
Oh, I really hope he's not
making decisions

688
00:30:31,298 --> 00:30:33,298
based on animal code names.

689
00:30:35,636 --> 00:30:37,302
Incoming!

690
00:30:38,706 --> 00:30:41,073
All right, Hoss,
let's check these out.

691
00:30:44,078 --> 00:30:46,311
Guys, you got
two hostiles in the lobby.

692
00:30:48,582 --> 00:30:50,816
- Hyah! Hyah!
- Hyah!

693
00:30:54,088 --> 00:30:55,787
Hyah! Hyah!

694
00:30:59,326 --> 00:31:01,159
Guess your old tricks
don't work.

695
00:31:01,161 --> 00:31:05,297
I don't need tricks,
just collateral.

696
00:31:14,575 --> 00:31:16,241
Ohh.

697
00:31:20,414 --> 00:31:23,415
Onyx just released
the gas. What should we do?

698
00:31:23,417 --> 00:31:26,285
The gas is spreading.
Do you copy?

699
00:31:26,458 --> 00:31:28,959
Arrow, Arrow do you copy?

700
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,662
Handle the gas.
We've got Reynolds. Move.

701
00:31:36,664 --> 00:31:37,930
The gas is coming
from the trash can.

702
00:31:37,932 --> 00:31:39,932
Everybody get
behind me now!

703
00:31:39,934 --> 00:31:41,433
Get behind me now!

704
00:31:55,983 --> 00:31:57,950
I'm going after
Reynolds.

705
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:58,984
Night-night.

706
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,386
Overwatch, we need a way

707
00:32:01,388 --> 00:32:02,821
to neutralize the nerve gas.

708
00:32:02,823 --> 00:32:04,823
You could burn it,
but I don't suggest it

709
00:32:04,825 --> 00:32:06,391
since you're still inside
the building.

710
00:32:06,393 --> 00:32:08,193
We won't be for long,
I hope.

711
00:32:09,396 --> 00:32:10,662
The breaches are too small

712
00:32:10,664 --> 00:32:12,130
to evacuate
all these people.

713
00:32:12,132 --> 00:32:13,772
Which is why we're
gonna make them bigger.

714
00:32:24,345 --> 00:32:26,211
Going somewhere?

715
00:32:26,213 --> 00:32:28,347
I wasn't gonna tell
anyone about the gold.

716
00:32:28,349 --> 00:32:31,049
You know, it turns out
money can buy happiness.

717
00:32:31,051 --> 00:32:34,152
It just can't buy
peace of mind.

718
00:32:34,154 --> 00:32:36,388
Uh! Uh!

719
00:32:38,425 --> 00:32:40,559
Hyah! Hyah...

720
00:33:14,895 --> 00:33:16,428
You all right?

721
00:33:22,202 --> 00:33:24,202
Who the hell are you?

722
00:33:27,141 --> 00:33:29,408
I'm the Green Arrow.

723
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:30,909
I got one of Onyx's
flashbangs.

724
00:33:30,911 --> 00:33:32,544
It should be enough
to ignite the gas.

725
00:33:32,546 --> 00:33:33,945
Ok, everyone,
when I count to 3,

726
00:33:33,947 --> 00:33:35,714
that wall is going bye-bye,

727
00:33:35,716 --> 00:33:37,249
so I need you all
to haul ass.

728
00:33:37,251 --> 00:33:39,117
There is nerve gas followed
by a huge explosion.

729
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:40,685
I don't think they need
the motivation.

730
00:33:40,687 --> 00:33:44,656
Good point.
1, 2...

731
00:33:44,658 --> 00:33:45,991
3!

732
00:33:54,268 --> 00:33:57,335
Gas dispersed.
All civilians accounted for.

733
00:33:57,337 --> 00:33:58,570
Good work.

734
00:33:58,572 --> 00:34:00,038
The other four are down.

735
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,274
- Onyx is in the limo.
- What about this guy?

736
00:34:02,276 --> 00:34:03,775
He helped steal
millions in foreign gold

737
00:34:03,777 --> 00:34:05,710
and turned a blind eye
when his comrades

738
00:34:05,712 --> 00:34:08,213
were being killed off
in fake terrorist attacks.

739
00:34:08,215 --> 00:34:10,449
That's good work
back there.

740
00:34:10,451 --> 00:34:12,584
Just following your
lead, Hoss.

741
00:34:19,572 --> 00:34:20,971
Can we do this
after every win?

742
00:34:20,973 --> 00:34:22,813
Oh, a new tradition for
a new era. I like that.

743
00:34:23,195 --> 00:34:25,262
To go with our new
team arrow victory dance.

744
00:34:25,264 --> 00:34:26,630
I didn't know
we had an old one.

745
00:34:26,632 --> 00:34:28,732
We don't. Never will.

746
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:31,668
Things won't be changing
around here that much.

747
00:34:32,504 --> 00:34:34,371
Look...

748
00:34:35,841 --> 00:34:37,140
There's something
you should know.

749
00:34:37,142 --> 00:34:39,876
- You went to Oliver.
- You told him.

750
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:41,812
She didn't have to.

751
00:34:41,814 --> 00:34:44,548
I know you,
Rene.

752
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:47,184
I know all of you.

753
00:34:47,186 --> 00:34:49,953
It's a leader's job to.

754
00:34:49,955 --> 00:34:51,721
Gift time.

755
00:34:51,723 --> 00:34:53,657
Oh, yes. So...

756
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:55,759
Curtis and I have been
working on

757
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:57,661
a little something
in our spare time.

758
00:34:57,663 --> 00:34:58,895
Very limited spare time,
may I add?

759
00:34:58,897 --> 00:35:02,299
We call it
the Green Monster.

760
00:35:03,869 --> 00:35:05,268
Or something cooler
than that.

761
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:06,703
Like, pretty much whatever
you want to call it.

762
00:35:06,705 --> 00:35:08,305
The important part is
it shoots arrows

763
00:35:08,307 --> 00:35:10,307
instead of crossbow bolts.

764
00:35:10,309 --> 00:35:12,275
260-pound draw weight.

765
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:14,444
The arrows exit the gate at 400 fps.
That's feet per second.

766
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:16,613
Integrated recoil energy
dissipation system.

767
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:18,081
Adjustable
mount scope,

768
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:20,517
quick detach quivers,
pistol grip,

769
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:22,419
finger guards,
non-slip rubber insert.

770
00:35:22,421 --> 00:35:24,454
You two want
a moment alone?

771
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:26,256
You want to take
it for a spin?

772
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:40,070
Damn, Hoss.

773
00:35:40,072 --> 00:35:41,605
Did you guys put stabilizers
on that crossbow?

774
00:35:41,607 --> 00:35:42,973
Nope.

775
00:35:42,975 --> 00:35:44,474
That aim there is
pure John Diggle.

776
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:46,409
Not a bad idea, though,
for the next upgrade.

777
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:57,621
Nice going.
Steady.

778
00:35:57,623 --> 00:35:59,389
See? Told you.
The tremor's gone.

779
00:35:59,391 --> 00:36:01,558
Well, I'm convinced.

780
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,894
You were wrong about
one thing, though.

781
00:36:03,896 --> 00:36:05,295
What's that?

782
00:36:07,232 --> 00:36:09,966
You can make the hard
calls on your own just fine.

783
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:20,777
Thank you.

784
00:36:22,181 --> 00:36:23,547
Hey.

785
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:27,317
So, uh, your friends
did good last night.

786
00:36:27,319 --> 00:36:29,286
I had a feeling John
would get it together.

787
00:36:29,288 --> 00:36:30,954
How did you manage?

788
00:36:30,956 --> 00:36:33,056
Well, too many councilmen
owe Pollard too many favors.

789
00:36:33,058 --> 00:36:34,658
It's--it's gonna pass,
Oliver.

790
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,493
Well, I'll veto it.

791
00:36:36,495 --> 00:36:38,128
You've got enough
PR problems as it is, don't you think?

792
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:40,297
Besides, they've got enough
votes for an override.

793
00:36:40,299 --> 00:36:42,365
There has to be
something that we can do.

794
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:44,534
Matter of fact...

795
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:46,102
Let the record show
there are no nays

796
00:36:46,104 --> 00:36:47,671
on the anti-vigilante
measure.

797
00:36:47,673 --> 00:36:48,738
Those in favor?

798
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:49,906
Point of order.

799
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:54,211
Does it address the matter
at hand, Mr. Mayor?

800
00:36:54,213 --> 00:36:56,813
It does,
madame parliamentarian.

801
00:36:58,183 --> 00:37:00,984
Thank you.
And good morning.

802
00:37:00,986 --> 00:37:03,486
As you know,
I have been accused

803
00:37:03,488 --> 00:37:06,189
of a great many things
recently,

804
00:37:06,191 --> 00:37:09,059
including but not limited
to supporting vigilantes

805
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:12,529
at the expense of our men
and women in uniform.

806
00:37:12,531 --> 00:37:14,564
This was never my intention.

807
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:16,800
In the wake of
the attacks on the SCPD,

808
00:37:16,802 --> 00:37:19,536
putting this police force
back on its feet is

809
00:37:19,538 --> 00:37:21,972
my number one priority
as mayor.

810
00:37:21,974 --> 00:37:26,142
We need the women and men
of the SCPD on our streets

811
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:28,411
protecting us,
but they can't do that

812
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:31,815
if they are busy
hunting vigilantes.

813
00:37:31,817 --> 00:37:34,851
That is why I oppose
this bill,

814
00:37:34,853 --> 00:37:36,886
and that is why I am
invoking chapter 9

815
00:37:36,888 --> 00:37:38,622
of the city charter.

816
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:44,294
And you are aware that
will convert

817
00:37:44,296 --> 00:37:45,895
councilwoman
Pollard's bill

818
00:37:45,897 --> 00:37:47,864
to a citywide
referendum?

819
00:37:47,866 --> 00:37:49,766
I certainly am.

820
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:52,902
Because last night, a group
of vigilantes saved

821
00:37:52,904 --> 00:37:55,405
hundreds of lives.

822
00:37:55,407 --> 00:37:58,208
So if we are going to decide

823
00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:00,243
on diverting
police resources

824
00:38:00,245 --> 00:38:03,213
towards stopping them,
we are not going to do that

825
00:38:03,215 --> 00:38:06,116
until the people of
Star City have spoken.

826
00:38:10,689 --> 00:38:12,722
What the hell
was that?

827
00:38:12,724 --> 00:38:16,092
Stay of execution.

828
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:20,697
The mayor's procedural maneuver

829
00:38:20,699 --> 00:38:23,233
took both the council
and the public by surprise.

830
00:38:23,235 --> 00:38:26,536
How the public will decide
on the issue of vigilantism

831
00:38:26,538 --> 00:38:27,904
is anyone's guess.

832
00:38:27,906 --> 00:38:29,372
According
to multiple reports,

833
00:38:29,374 --> 00:38:32,075
the city council was set
to pass strict measures

834
00:38:32,077 --> 00:38:34,711
against the Green Arrow
and his team.

835
00:38:34,713 --> 00:38:37,080
This anti-vigilante
legislation was introduced...

836
00:38:37,082 --> 00:38:39,983
Who are you protecting?

837
00:38:56,935 --> 00:38:58,368
Oliver...

838
00:38:58,370 --> 00:38:59,969
with a gift.

839
00:38:59,971 --> 00:39:01,471
You busy?

840
00:39:01,473 --> 00:39:04,974
No. Um...No. I--come in.

841
00:39:04,976 --> 00:39:07,444
I was just working on
a name for the startup,

842
00:39:07,446 --> 00:39:09,145
which would be a lot easier

843
00:39:09,147 --> 00:39:10,780
if Curtis and I
actually knew

844
00:39:10,782 --> 00:39:13,683
what we were trying
to start up. Heh!

845
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:16,653
You know, that's
tomorrow's problem.

846
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:20,090
Is it my birthday?

847
00:39:20,092 --> 00:39:21,558
William got an "A"
on his test.

848
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,759
Oh, he did? Oh,
that's awesome.

849
00:39:22,761 --> 00:39:24,027
I mean,
I knew he would.

850
00:39:24,029 --> 00:39:25,428
He's super smart.

851
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:27,130
His understanding
of math is at prodigy levels,

852
00:39:27,132 --> 00:39:29,599
much like me
at his age.

853
00:39:29,601 --> 00:39:31,401
Ha ha! Can you believe
he's your son?

854
00:39:31,403 --> 00:39:33,670
I didn't mean it--
that's not what I meant.

855
00:39:33,672 --> 00:39:35,572
I mean,
math isn't everything.

856
00:39:35,574 --> 00:39:36,773
I mean, you have--

857
00:39:36,775 --> 00:39:38,274
you have so many
redeeming qualities.

858
00:39:38,276 --> 00:39:40,844
You know, you have
amazing abs and...

859
00:39:41,747 --> 00:39:43,346
I'm just gonna
open this.

860
00:39:43,348 --> 00:39:44,748
- Please.
- If that's ok.

861
00:39:46,351 --> 00:39:48,084
Hmm.

862
00:39:48,086 --> 00:39:51,154
It's a key to my apartment.

863
00:39:51,156 --> 00:39:53,089
Ok.

864
00:39:54,593 --> 00:39:55,992
Um...

865
00:39:57,396 --> 00:39:59,696
Won't that be confusing
for William?

866
00:39:59,698 --> 00:40:02,332
I mean, it sure as hell
is confusing for me.

867
00:40:02,334 --> 00:40:05,034
I know that when I took
William in,

868
00:40:05,036 --> 00:40:09,372
we agreed that we would
keep our distance because...

869
00:40:09,374 --> 00:40:11,608
He was gonna have a lot
to process.

870
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:13,243
He's still got
a lot to process.

871
00:40:13,245 --> 00:40:16,846
Yes, he does. Every day,
there's a new challenge.

872
00:40:16,848 --> 00:40:18,615
I sense a "but" coming.

873
00:40:18,617 --> 00:40:20,216
There's a "but" coming,
right?

874
00:40:20,218 --> 00:40:23,586
But then I saw you
with him.

875
00:40:25,023 --> 00:40:29,592
And I became 100% sure
that if you want...

876
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:34,731
his life will be better
with you in it...

877
00:40:37,469 --> 00:40:39,636
just like mine.

878
00:40:39,638 --> 00:40:43,673
Are you sure that's
what you want?

879
00:40:43,675 --> 00:40:45,275
I'm sure.

880

881
00:41:53,289 --> 00:41:55,289
Greg!
Move your head.
