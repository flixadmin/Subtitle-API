1
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,190
Hey, man, look at the sad sack

2
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,190
I found moping around the lobby.

3
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,710
- Hey.

4
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,710
- Hey, there, Walt.

5
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,200
- How you doing, buddy?

6
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,200
- Good.

7
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,790
Listen, I'm sorry to drop in on you

8
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,790
out of the blue.

9
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,910
- No, no, no.

10
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,910
- If it's a bad time, I could--

11
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,430
No. I'm just kind of settling into the new

12
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,430
digs here. What do you think?

13
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,320
It is very nice.

14
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,350
- Yeah. Congratulations again.

15
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,350
- Yeah.

16
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,190
- We're all very proud of you.

17
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,190
- Oh, well, thanks.

18
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,350
My days of chasing dirt-balls is over.

19
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,590
But I'll tell you what, being a boss...

20
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,990
...own kind of grind,

21
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,990
you know what I'm saying?

22
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:23,790
Steve, would you mind if.... I've gotta

23
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:23,790
run something by Hank, if it's all right.

24
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:27,030
Yeah. Yeah, hey, somebody's

25
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:27,030
gotta go chase the bad guys.

26
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,030
- Walt, it's a pleasure seeing you again.

27
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,030
- Thanks again, Steve.

28
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,190
- Appreciate it.

29
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,190
- Sure.

30
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,830
Hey. Look at that.

31
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,750
Jesus, Walt.

32
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,590
- That's nice. Let me see that.

33
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,590
- Yeah.

34
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,510
Wow, that's beautiful.

35
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,590
- Was it a birthday present?

36
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,590
- Yeah.

37
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,150
Well, I mean, not really.

38
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,070
I bought it for myself.

39
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,710
- Hey, well, have a seat.

40
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,710
- Thanks.

41
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,470
New car, new watch.

42
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,070
Good for you.

43
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,990
With all the curveballs

44
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,990
that were thrown at you this year...

45
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,310
...you deserve to treat yourself.

46
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,790
I mean, as long as you got

47
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,790
the money to spend, that is.

48
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,990
So how's Sky?

49
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,590
Actually, she went to work

50
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,590
this morning.

51
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,350
She wanted to.

52
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,680
She said she needed to, you know,

53
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,680
keep her mind occupied, and....

54
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,550
- That's good. Great, actually.

55
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,550
- Yeah.

56
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,350
I mean, as long as you're all right

57
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,350
with her being on her own and stuff.

58
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,670
Yeah, well, you know,

59
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,670
I'm right there with her most of the time.

60
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,430
And Mariano kind of keeps an eye

61
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,430
on her when I'm not, so....

62
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,630
- Good.

63
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,630
- Yeah.

64
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,670
And what about the whole idea

65
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,670
of talking to somebody?

66
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:42,310
You know, Marie goes off about Dave

67
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:42,310
like he's a rock star shrink, you know?

68
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,790
They come in like zombies, out

69
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,790
like larks, you know what I'm saying?

70
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,150
That's great.

71
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,150
Actually, she already found someone.

72
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,190
Yeah. Peter....

73
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,470
I don't know why I'm drawing a blank

74
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,470
on his last name. Peter....

75
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,590
Anyway, he's out in Rio Rancho.

76
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,590
He's supposed to be top-notch.

77
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,540
Good, good. I'm glad you're on it. That's

78
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,540
not something you wanna let fester.

79
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,440
No. No, you don't. You don't.

80
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,270
Hank, I just....

81
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:16,110
I wanted to thank you and Marie

82
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:16,110
for watching the kids.

83
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,270
No, it's-- It really is--

84
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,710
No, it's nice of you...

85
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,190
...and I'd like to come by tonight

86
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,190
and see them, if that's all right.

87
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,950
Of course. What do you mean?

88
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,950
You don't have to ask that.

89
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,840
It's great having them.

90
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,840
They're great kids.

91
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,350
I appreciate that.

92
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,270
I do.

93
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,750
Something else

94
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,750
on your mind there, Walt?

95
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,190
Walt, feel free to, you know....

96
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,030
Skyler doesn't love me anymore.

97
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,230
And I don't know what to do, Hank.

98
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,230
I don't.

99
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,870
She....

100
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,510
She says that I'm a bad influence

101
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,510
on the kids...

102
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,310
...and that I'm not....

103
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,800
- Not good for them.

104
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,800
- Jeez, Walt.

105
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,750
No.

106
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,880
She thinks I'm a bad father.

107
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,110
I'm sorry.

108
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,070
Hey, I mean, Sky and you

109
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,070
got your issues...

110
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,950
...but that there, that's.... That's....

111
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,720
I mean, I'm no....

112
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,180
I'm not an expert on parenting or

113
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,180
anything, but from where I'm sitting...

114
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,510
...I just don't see it, you know?

115
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,310
I mean, I....

116
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,790
I think you're great with the kids.

117
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,790
I think you're great with the kids.

118
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:53,190
You're a provider,

119
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:53,190
a role model, you know?

120
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,510
Hell, the guts you showed

121
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,510
going toe-to-toe with cancer...

122
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,560
...that alone, that's an inspiration

123
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,560
to me, you know?

124
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,110
- No, I've made mistakes, you know?

125
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,110
- Yeah. Yeah, I know.

126
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,920
Listen, I'm gonna get a coffee.

127
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,920
You want a coffee?

128
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,430
- Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

129
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,430
- I'm gonna have a cup of coffee.

130
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,310
I'm gonna give you a moment

131
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,310
to just get it together there.

132
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,870
You want cream and sugar?

133
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,870
Yeah, yeah. Hank, I'm sorry.

134
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,750
No, no, no.

135
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,550
That-- Cup of coffee, right?

136
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,550
All right.

137
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,180
Just take a moment. Take a moment.

138
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,310
You know, you two

139
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,310
are really great together.

140
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:27,470
Take it from me, buddy,

141
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:27,470
it's always darkest just before the dawn.

142
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,750
Yeah.

143
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,870
What is this place? What is this place?

144
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,870
What are we doing here?

145
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,750
- Get me the table.

146
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,750
- I can't be here.

147
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,230
My daughter, my little girl,

148
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,230
she's gonna be home soon.

149
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,550
What? What are you doing?

150
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,680
- Mike, Mike, Mike....

151
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,680
- Shut up!

152
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,790
Give me her phone.

153
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,470
All right, Lydia.

154
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,200
My friends here don't know you

155
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,200
like I do...

156
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,110
...so they are very kindly

157
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,110
giving you one last chance.

158
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,470
There's your script. Study it.

159
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,950
In about 30 seconds, I'm gonna dial

160
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,950
Agent Schrader on your line here...

161
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,430
...and you're gonna pass along

162
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,430
this information...

163
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,270
...and then we'll see what we see.

164
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,270
But here are the rules:

165
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,710
If you yell for help, try to give the man

166
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,710
some kind of coded message...

167
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,990
...or otherwise tip him off...

168
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:37,310
...I am gonna pull out my pistol

169
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:37,310
and shoot you in the head.

170
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,230
Same goes for panicking,

171
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,230
breaking down into tears.

172
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,270
Remember how you like to do that?

173
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,830
If it happens this time,

174
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,830
I am going to pull my pistol out...

175
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,350
...and I am going to shoot you

176
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,350
in the head.

177
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,950
Look at me, not at them.

178
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,750
Lydia, look at me.

179
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:00,630
If you make Schrader suspicious

180
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:00,630
in any way...

181
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,390
...any way at all,

182
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,390
tell me what's gonna happen next.

183
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,790
- You'll pull out your gun and shoot me.

184
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,790
- And where will I shoot you?

185
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,560
- In the head.

186
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,560
- In the head. That's right.

187
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,180
And it's a pistol, not a gun.

188
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,670
I'm expecting precision here.

189
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,100
We up and running?

190
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,950
Yeah. Computer's set.

191
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,630
Okay, Lydia.

192
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:26,030
If you ever needed to give

193
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:26,030
the performance of a lifetime...

194
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,550
...it's now.

195
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,880
You're up.

196
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,870
ASAC's office.

197
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,110
Hi. Lydia Rodarte-Quayle

198
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,110
calling for Agent Schrader.

199
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,830
I'm sorry. What's this regarding?

200
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,430
Madrigal Electromotive.

201
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,430
Lydia Rodarte Quayle

202
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,430
...

203
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,750
Hold, please.

204
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:50,670
Hank, Lydia Rodarte-Quayle

205
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:50,670
on line one.

206
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,230
Hank Schrader.

207
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,230
How can I help you, Ms. Quayle?

208
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,230
Well, this is kind of an odd....

209
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:03,830
It's just that I was in our warehouse,

210
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:03,830
supervising a shipment of chemicals...

211
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,270
...when I noticed a device on the bottom

212
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,270
of one of our barrels of methylamine.

213
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,270
- A device?

214
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,270
- Yeah. I guess you'd call it that. I mean...

215
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:17,150
...I'm certainly no expert,

216
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:17,150
but it looks to me like some kind of a....

217
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,430
A tracking device or a GPS.

218
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:25,070
So I was just wondering

219
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:25,070
if maybe your people put it there.

220
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,870
Not that it's any of my business, but

221
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,870
the last thing I wanna do is interfere...

222
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,590
...with a law enforcement operation

223
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,590
or a sting...

224
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,630
...or whatever you call it.

225
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,430
So, I don't know...

226
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,990
...maybe you could

227
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,990
give me some guidance?

228
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,270
Well, I'll tell you what.

229
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,470
Set that barrel aside for me,

230
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,470
if you would...

231
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,910
...and I'll look into it

232
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,910
and get back to you.

233
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,470
And in the meantime,

234
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,470
mum's the word, all right?

235
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,510
Yeah. All right. Sure thing.

236
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,870
Okay, great.

237
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,870
Thanks for the call, Ms. Quayle.

238
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,790
Bye-bye.

239
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,630
Hey, Gomey, come here, would you?

240
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,750
- Yeah?

241
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,750
- Hey, man.

242
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,630
You know anything about GPS trackers

243
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,630
on a methylamine barrel?

244
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,510
Madrigal Houston, I'm talking about.

245
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,240
Nope. Nobody from my team

246
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,240
planted anything. Why?

247
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,350
Oh, I don't know. I figured as much.

248
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,550
All right. Thanks.

249
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,310
I know what you're thinking,

250
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,310
but I didn't do it.

251
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,630
- I'm telling you, I didn't plant that thing.

252
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,630
- Shut up.

253
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,190
And there you have it, like I said.

254
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,350
All right. So now what?

255
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,270
It's not the DEA's, so Schrader's

256
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,270
probably thinking some crew planted it...

257
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,470
...looking for a weak spot

258
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,470
to pull a heist.

259
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,750
He's gonna send a team

260
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,750
over to that warehouse.

261
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,750
He's gonna wire it out the wazoo.

262
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,750
Bugs, cameras, the whole nine yards.

263
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,670
So the warehouse is too hot.

264
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,270
Her supply is useless to us now.

265
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,710
It depends on how fast Schrader

266
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,710
can get his guys there.

267
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,030
We're 900 miles closer, after all.

268
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,390
I say we keep listening,

269
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,390
suss out how much time we have.

270
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,990
If it's at least 12 hours,

271
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,990
then we head down there...

272
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,110
...use her security code

273
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,110
to gain access...

274
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,070
...and we take every barrel we can.

275
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,830
U-Haul can only take six or seven

276
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,830
before the suspension gives out.

277
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,030
It's a stopgap. But right now,

278
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,030
it's the best we can do.

279
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,680
Well, what about her?

280
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,830
You two drive the barrels back tonight.

281
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,710
I'll deal with her.

282
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,470
No! No, no, no.

283
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,470
You're making a mistake.

284
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,360
This was not me!

285
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,360
I swear to God I didn't do it!

286
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,160
I don't know.

287
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,160
Sounds like she's telling the truth to me.

288
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,270
She has a gun to her head, kid.

289
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,160
Everyone sounds like Meryl Streep

290
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,160
with a gun to their head.

291
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,190
I'm sorry, Jesse.

292
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,550
You're the one who wanted

293
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,550
to put it up to a vote.

294
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,790
It's two against one.

295
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,630
No. No! You can't kill me! Come on!

296
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,230
I swear I didn't do anything!

297
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,150
Janice, give me Doughty

298
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,150
in the Houston office, will you?

299
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,910
You got it.

300
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,430
Hank Schrader for Mr. Doughty.

301
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,790
He's on the line.

302
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:12,550
Hey, Erol. Please tell me you guys

303
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:12,550
didn't do something as lamebrained...

304
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,350
...as put a GPS tracker on the outside

305
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,350
of a barrel of methylamine.

306
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,430
One earmarked for the

307
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,430
Madrigal warehouse in Houston?

308
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,150
Who's asking?

309
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,150
Did someone find them?

310
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,350
Jesus. Are you shitting me?

311
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,350
Since when do you put a GPS tracker...

312
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,310
- ...on the outside of a barrel?

313
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,310
- We didn't have time to go in...

314
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,910
...with hazard suits, Hank.

315
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,910
They were about to ship.

316
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,470
We epoxied them to the bottom.

317
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,470
They were well-hidden.

318
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:38,270
Oh, really? Well, not well-hidden

319
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:38,270
enough. How many barrels you tag?

320
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,310
All of them. All the ones

321
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,310
headed to the warehouse, anyway.

322
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:46,310
Christ. All right. Well, sit tight.

323
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:46,310
Let me figure out how to play this.

324
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,910
Next time, a little communication first,

325
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,910
all right?

326
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,950
- Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

327
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,950
- Asshole.

328
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,710
Aside-- Aside from the fact...

329
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,590
...that we almost killed this woman,

330
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,590
all of those barrels are already marked.

331
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,550
We solve the problem we can.

332
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,550
This has not changed the equation

333
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,550
one iota for her.

334
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,540
Oh, come on! You are not seriously

335
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,540
still considering killing me?

336
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,950
I saved you! If it weren't for me,

337
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,950
we'd all be in jail right now.

338
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,550
I hate to say it, but she's right, Mike.

339
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,670
She saved our asses

340
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,670
by finding that thing.

341
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,830
She is saving herself.

342
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,830
She's a loose cannon.

343
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,670
I am telling you, she will turn a gun or

344
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,670
a badge on us the first chance she gets.

345
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,390
The woman put a hit out on me.

346
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,230
Seriously?

347
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,320
Wait. A hit? What? Like the mafia?

348
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,230
Yeah, like the mafia.

349
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,830
Hey! You still need methylamine,

350
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,830
don't you? Right?

351
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,220
You wanna talk methylamine?

352
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:55,070
Then tell your partner to stop

353
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:55,070
threatening me, and let's talk.

354
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,550
Talk about what? You heard.

355
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,830
You can't even get us a single barrel.

356
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,990
Who said anything about barrels?

357
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,940
I'm talking about an ocean

358
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,940
of the stuff.

359
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,750
Just give him a minute, would you?

360
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,750
Trust him.

361
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,110
"Trust him."

362
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,720
Okay. So, let's hear it.

363
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,230
Not without a guarantee that once

364
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,230
I tell you how to get what you want...

365
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,590
- ...I won't be killed anyway.

366
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,590
- Fine. You have my word.

367
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,030
- Not good enough.

368
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,030
- Look, lady--

369
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:41,030
- Do you have children?

370
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:41,030
- That has nothing to do with this.

371
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,790
It's not a trick question.

372
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,790
Why don't you just answer it?

373
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,830
Yes, I have children. So what?

374
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,390
You think that somehow

375
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,390
because we're both parents...

376
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,870
...that I won't let my partner

377
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,870
do what's necessary?

378
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,630
- Swear on their lives.

379
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,630
- Oh, what?

380
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,310
Swear on your children's lives

381
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,310
that I won't be harmed.

382
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,350
Otherwise, how can I trust you?

383
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,990
Look, you're a smart businesswoman.

384
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,990
You understand the concept

385
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,990
of leverage.

386
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,750
- Please don't patronize me. I hate that.

387
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,750
- You have none.

388
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,150
But trust has to work both ways, Lydia.

389
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,190
Is it true that you put a hit out on Mike?

390
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,630
- Yes.

391
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,630
- Why?

392
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,990
I was scared.

393
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:31,310
- Of Mike?

394
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:31,310
- Not at first.

395
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,310
There are men who used to work

396
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,310
with Gus Fring in custody now.

397
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,310
Nine of them. They know everything

398
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,310
about me. Everything.

399
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,750
Some of them even know about you,

400
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,750
assuming you're the master chemist...

401
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,150
...they're always talking about.

402
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:47,310
And if it's these nine

403
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:47,310
that you're worried about...

404
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,670
- ...why put the hit on Mike?

405
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,670
- I had no choice.

406
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,390
I'm not going to prison and have my

407
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,390
daughter raised in a group home.

408
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,870
Do you have any idea

409
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,870
what those places are like?

410
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,790
I gave him a list of names...

411
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,310
...but instead of handling it,

412
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,310
he's protecting them.

413
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,310
So I hired someone else.

414
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,310
At that point, there was no option...

415
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,190
...but to add Mike to the list.

416
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,870
This ocean of methylamine...

417
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,070
...that you claim

418
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,070
you can get your hands on...

419
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:20,510
...how much are we

420
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:20,510
talking about, literally?

421
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,630
How does 24,000 gallons sound?

422
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,710
Once a week, on a Wednesday, a freight

423
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,710
train leaves the Port of Long Beach...

424
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,830
...loaded with industrial chemicals.

425
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,870
There's always at least one tanker car

426
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,870
full of methylamine...

427
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,500
...which we import from

428
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,500
a manufacturer in Guangzhou.

429
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,150
The train travels east

430
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,150
through Arizona...

431
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,310
...stops at a rail yard

432
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,310
outside Flagstaff...

433
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:47,190
...where it gets broken down and rebuilt.

434
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:47,190
But the methylamine always moves on...

435
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,190
...destined for our pesticide concerns

436
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,190
in Texas and Oklahoma.

437
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,190
Which means that it passes

438
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,190
right through your home state.

439
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:58,390
There's a remote three-mile stretch

440
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:58,390
here in McKinley County.

441
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,470
That's where you do it.

442
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,230
That's where we do what exactly?

443
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,620
Get your methylamine.

444
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:09,680
- Like, rob it? Like Jesse James?

445
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:09,680
- You want the stuff?

446
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,030
I'm offering you enough

447
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,030
to fill a swimming pool.

448
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,550
You are offering us a quick trip

449
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,550
to prison. That's what I'm hearing.

450
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,950
Stopping a train, post 9/11?

451
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:22,350
You have any idea how many alarms

452
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:22,350
that'll set off between here and D.C.?

453
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:26,270
None, if you do it right here.

454
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:26,270
If a freight train is stopped in transit...

455
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,830
...anywhere other than

456
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,830
the usual yards or depots...

457
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,750
...absolutely, a signal will alarm

458
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,750
the FRA and the TSA Surface Division...

459
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,070
...at the Department of Homeland

460
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,070
Security. But what you don't know...

461
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,950
...and I do, because my job requires me

462
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,950
to keep track of my buyers' shipments...

463
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,430
...this is dark territory.

464
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,160
- What's that?

465
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,160
- Train-speak for an area of no contact.

466
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,950
It's a dead zone.

467
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:51,470
No automated supervision system,

468
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:51,470
no alarms, no contact with control.

469
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,830
What about cell phones?

470
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,680
- Crew could just call the cops.

471
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,680
- No cellular either.

472
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,670
I'm telling you, it's the perfect place.

473
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,870
You'd have time enough

474
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,870
to stop the train...

475
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,430
...siphon off as much methylamine

476
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,430
as you can carry...

477
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,990
- ...get away before the police are called.

478
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,990
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

479
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,990
Assuming we can stop

480
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,990
a moving train...

481
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,510
...how do we know we have the right

482
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,510
one? And which tanker car is which?

483
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,270
I can't believe that they would

484
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,270
advertise their contents.

485
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,670
Once the train gets rebuilt in Flagstaff...

486
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,480
...a final manifest gets uploaded

487
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,480
to my company's server.

488
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,670
I'll have it for you sometime

489
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,670
between midnight and 2 a.m.

490
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,510
That'll give you at least

491
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,510
six hours of lead time.

492
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,830
Keep in mind, I'm taking a huge risk

493
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,830
supplying this information.

494
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,260
I expect to be paid.

495
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,550
We can talk percentages later.

496
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,870
You know what this means, don't you?

497
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,470
We've gotta off the crew.

498
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,590
How do you figure?

499
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,110
If we don't, the engineer's

500
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,110
gonna call the cops...

501
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,590
...as soon as he gets out of the

502
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,590
dead zone. It's only three miles long.

503
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,710
- We're way out in the boonies.

504
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,710
- I don't care if it's in the Gobi Desert.

505
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,310
Once they get word,

506
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,310
the FBI and Homeland Security...

507
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:00,350
...are gonna swoop down with choppers

508
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:00,350
on us so fast, it'll make our heads spin.

509
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,950
And there is no hiding

510
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,950
in that open country.

511
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,990
- How many in the crew?

512
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,990
- Just two.

513
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,350
- An engineer and a conductor.

514
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,350
- Assuming there are no security guards.

515
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,270
No guards. It's not like

516
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,270
we're carrying nuclear warheads.

517
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,430
Wait. Two guys.

518
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,590
Can't we just tie them up or something?

519
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,510
And then what? Even if we wear a mask,

520
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,510
we're leaving two witnesses behind.

521
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:24,390
Bottom line, I have done this

522
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:24,390
long enough to know...

523
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,390
...that there are

524
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,390
two kinds of heists:

525
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,350
Those where the guys

526
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,350
get away with it...

527
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:33,080
...and those that leave witnesses.

528
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,870
Give me a break.

529
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,870
You guys were gonna murder me.

530
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,390
I thought you were professionals.

531
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,390
Can you say "ASAC"?

532
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,630
"ASAC." Can you say that?

533
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,150
Say, "ASAC Schrader."

534
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,360
If those turn out to be her first words,

535
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,360
I will beat you with my shoe.

536
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:58,430
- Don't listen to him, Holly.

537
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:58,430
- I'm just telling it like it is, babe.

538
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,950
Boss man. I'm the boss man.

539
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,190
Say, "Boss man."

540
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,790
Am I the boss man? I'm the boss.

541
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:09,390
Hey, that better be something from

542
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:09,390
a boob instead of some fake soy crap.

543
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:12,020
- Yeah, yeah.

544
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:12,020
- My little girl...

545
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,590
- Your little girl.

546
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,590
- ...deserves the real McCoy.

547
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,910
- No. See?

548
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,910
- Okay.

549
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,830
She doesn't want it.

550
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,830
No, she wants me.

551
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,590
She wants me.

552
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:27,230
Yeah, my little girl,

553
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:27,230
because I'm not giving her back.

554
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,720
Yeah, I know.

555
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,870
What about Emo McGee?

556
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,790
Has he come out

557
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,790
of his room today?

558
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,310
Barely.

559
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,110
When he does, he barely talks.

560
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,510
Yeah, well, what do you expect,

561
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,510
you know?

562
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,790
His parents treat him

563
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,790
like he's a baby there.

564
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,790
Flynn, do you want me to heat up

565
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,790
some of that lasagne...

566
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,670
...to hold you over till dinner?

567
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,990
No.

568
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,790
Hey, I picked up Heat on Blu-ray.

569
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,790
Wanna watch it with me later?

570
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:04,910
No. And you can keep

571
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:04,910
talking about me now.

572
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,830
Well, if no one else is gonna

573
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,830
offer an opinion, I will.

574
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,750
We do it the old-fashioned way.

575
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,350
We hit skid row, the Crystal Palace,

576
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,350
all the halfway houses...

577
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,150
...scrounge up about a dozen skells,

578
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,150
put them to work smurfing cold pills.

579
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,150
You mean switch back

580
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,150
to a pseudo cook.

581
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:27,070
You're the chemist. Admittedly,

582
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:27,070
it's gonna cut down on our output.

583
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,630
Like a factor of four or five.

584
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,990
It also means

585
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,990
that we will eat $80,000...

586
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,510
...we just invested

587
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,510
in our new lab equipment...

588
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,110
...which is only good for a P2P cook.

589
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,670
You know, I don't have to do

590
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,670
the math to know...

591
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,990
...that we'd be making

592
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,990
a fraction of the profit.

593
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:47,550
And making less money

594
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:47,550
is better than making nothing.

595
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,990
Oh, yeah, Mike?

596
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,990
Well, why don't you tell us why?

597
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,310
Why is making nothing

598
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,310
not an option?

599
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,070
- Walter--

600
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,070
- Let me tell you why.

601
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,390
It's because of your nine guys

602
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,390
in lockup, right?

603
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:02,230
You broke it, you pay for it. And we've

604
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:02,230
talked about this plenty already.

605
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,750
Well, maybe we better

606
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,750
talk about it a little more...

607
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,550
...because what it sounds like you're

608
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,550
telling me, Mike, is that from now on...

609
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,470
...we have no choice

610
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,470
but to do this piddling pseudo cook...

611
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,710
...so that we can pay back

612
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,710
your guys.

613
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:17,150
Or else what? Or else they're gonna

614
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:17,150
rat on us, and we end up in prison.

615
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:20,350
Yeah? And it sounds like

616
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:20,350
what you're telling me, Walter...

617
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,950
...is that you wanna do this heist...

618
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,070
...even if it means killing

619
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,070
a couple of innocent men.

620
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,990
That what you want?

621
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,430
You know, I don't know why you insist

622
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,430
on putting words in my mouth here.

623
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:37,620
What if we can rip off that train,

624
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:37,620
and no one ever knows it got robbed?

625
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,190
Maybe.

626
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,390
Just maybe.

627
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,310
It'll come from that direction.

628
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,070
Seven seventy-five.

629
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,230
Eight hundred.

630
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,460
Eight fourteen.

631
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,630
Wait a minute.

632
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:12,630
It's perfect. Yeah, we do it here.

633
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,780
We do it right here.

634
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,790
How are we looking, Mike?

635
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,990
All clear.

636
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,680
Copy that.

637
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,470
Go down, go down.

638
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,990
You got it. That's good, Fernando.

639
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,470
Hey.

640
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,560
- This one.

641
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,560
- Right.

642
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,750
- You good?

643
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,750
- Yeah.

644
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,510
- What's your name again?

645
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,510
- Todd.

646
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:30,230
Todd, on the day, are you gonna be able

647
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:30,230
to make this climb?

648
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,790
Yes, sir. I'll be ready.

649
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,150
All right.

650
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,230
- You mind if I ask you a question?

651
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,230
- No. Go ahead.

652
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,860
Well, I get why we want the tank

653
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,860
for the methylamine.

654
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,750
But why this other one for the water?

655
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,230
Well....

656
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,670
Jesse, it's your idea.

657
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,670
You wanna fill him in?

658
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,950
It's all about the weight, yo.

659
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:56,000
The tanker we're gonna hit gets weighed

660
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:56,000
when it gets loaded in Long Beach...

661
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,350
...and then again

662
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,350
when it's unloaded in Texas.

663
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,270
If the weights don't match...

664
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,670
...the train company's

665
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,670
gonna know it got robbed.

666
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,870
Okay.

667
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:08,070
Boosting methylamine from a train

668
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:08,070
is, like, a major rap.

669
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:14,470
The point is, no one other than us can

670
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:14,470
ever know that this robbery went down.

671
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,470
Nobody. You got it?

672
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,830
Yeah. Absolutely.

673
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,190
Are you sure?

674
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,070
Yes, sir.

675
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,150
With all that said,

676
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,150
the whole thing relies on us...

677
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,950
...replacing the weight of methylamine

678
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,950
we steal with the same weight in water.

679
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,190
So they'll never know

680
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,190
we hit them. Cool.

681
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:40,390
Aqueous methylamine is water-based,

682
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:40,390
yet it weighs slightly less than water.

683
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:45,910
We will be removing a thousand gallons

684
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:45,910
of methylamine from the tanker car...

685
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:50,510
...but replacing it with about nine-tenths

686
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:50,510
of that volume in water...

687
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:54,510
...which comes to 900.24 gallons.

688
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:58,030
Actually, Jesse,

689
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:58,030
let's make that an even 920...

690
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,150
...to account for spillage

691
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,150
and whatever will remain in the hose.

692
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,880
- Yeah.

693
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,880
- How we doing, by the way?

694
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:07,390
- Eight fifty. We're almost there.

695
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:07,390
- All right.

696
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:11,030
Won't they figure they got robbed,

697
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:11,030
getting watered-down methylamine?

698
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,470
Well, out of 24,000 gallons...

699
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:18,390
...it'll only amount to about

700
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:18,390
four percent dilution, so....

701
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,470
But, yes, you're right.

702
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,470
They will notice.

703
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:25,270
At which point, they will blame China...

704
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,870
...for sending

705
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,870
a marginally weaker batch.

706
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:32,470
Damn, you guys thought

707
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:32,470
of everything.

708
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,630
Flynn.

709
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,750
Flynn, open the door.

710
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,840
Just come out and talk to me.

711
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,430
I'm staying. That's all I have to say.

712
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:01,350
- What's going on?

713
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:01,350
- You got what you wanted, that's what.

714
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,070
Congratulations.

715
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,510
It's me. Open up.

716
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,630
Come on, Junior.

717
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,630
I'm not gonna ask twice.

718
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,190
What?

719
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,390
You know what.

720
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,230
Are you seriously kicking me out

721
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,230
of my own house?

722
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,990
Are you seriously doing that?

723
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,430
We are not kicking you

724
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,430
out of anywhere, son.

725
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:39,600
We love you. And this is your house

726
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:39,600
as much as it is ours.

727
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,550
But your mom and I need some time

728
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,550
alone, and you know that.

729
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,470
- We explained that to you.

730
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,470
- You haven't explained jack shit.

731
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,590
You want me out?

732
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,590
Explain to me why.

733
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,510
Why do I have to go

734
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,510
to Uncle Hank's?

735
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,670
Give me the exact reason

736
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,670
or I'm not going anywhere.

737
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,150
This is not gonna be a debate.

738
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,950
What's going on?

739
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,110
Why can't anybody tell me anything?

740
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:04,030
I want one good reason.

741
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,590
Because we're your parents

742
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,590
and you're our child.

743
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,550
That's reason enough.

744
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,550
Now, please, do as I ask.

745
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,630
Now.

746
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,470
It'll pass. He'll understand.

747
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,030
Don't start, Walt.

748
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,790
I won't change my mind about you.

749
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,870
Ever.

750
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,990
Well, I don't accept that.

751
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,990
You're my wife.

752
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,230
I'm not your wife, I'm your hostage.

753
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,120
But since you insist

754
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,120
on keeping me imprisoned...

755
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,710
...I'll make you a deal.

756
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:45,550
I will launder your money,

757
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:45,550
I'll keep your secrets...

758
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,390
...but the kids will stay

759
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,390
at Hank and Marie's...

760
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:51,310
...where they have

761
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:51,310
a chance of being safe.

762
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,110
I think you've seen too many movies.

763
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,630
Our children are not in danger.

764
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,990
Just a couple of days ago...

765
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,590
...you told me that a man

766
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,590
held a gun to your head.

767
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,950
You said it like it was a point of pride.

768
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,430
There's nothing you can say

769
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,430
that'll convince me...

770
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,630
...there won't come a day

771
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,630
that somebody will knock on that door...

772
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,190
...looking to harm you or me

773
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,190
or all of us.

774
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:21,550
And when that day comes,

775
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:21,550
the children cannot be here.

776
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,750
You agree to that...

777
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:31,070
...and I will be whatever kind of partner

778
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:31,070
you want me to be.

779
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,790
Okay.

780
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,790
By the way...

781
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:57,990
...you're visiting a therapist

782
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:57,990
from Rio Rancho. Peter.

783
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,190
Last name is up to you.

784
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,310
Out burying bodies?

785
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,030
Robbing a train.

786
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,070
- Yeah?

787
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,070
- It's me.

788
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,630
I've got it.

789
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:50,300
Okay, Mr. White, everything's set.

790
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,950
Hey, Wallace! Up ahead!

791
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,950
Stop the train now!

792
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,590
Stop!

793
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,950
Stop the train!

794
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,990
Now. Go, go, go.

795
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,470
Jesus. Thank God you guys

796
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,470
weren't asleep at the switch.

797
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,830
It'd be like pancake city out here.

798
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,150
Man.

799
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,150
Hey, you believe this?

800
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,350
I mean, shit fire

801
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,350
and save the matches.

802
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,750
Talk about bum luck.

803
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,310
Hey, man, I'm sorry to

804
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,310
put you guys out like this.

805
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,830
What's the trouble with it?

806
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,910
No clue. I was just driving

807
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,910
down the road.

808
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,830
All of a sudden, the old cow

809
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,830
just bellied up and died on me.

810
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,950
Either one of you guys know about

811
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,950
engines? Oh, of course you do.

812
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,990
That's why they call you

813
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,990
an engineer, right?

814
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,790
- All right.

815
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,790
- Think it's....

816
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,670
Think it's in there or something.

817
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,870
- You think?

818
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,870
- Yeah.

819
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,190
Probably a pretty good bet.

820
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,390
When was the last time

821
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,390
you changed the oil?

822
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,190
I don't know, man. I just drive it.

823
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,310
- Now. Go, go, go.

824
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,310
- We're on.

825
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,430
- Good?

826
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,430
- Yeah.

827
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,750
Go!

828
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,510
It looks good up here.

829
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,310
Now, hold up. There it is.

830
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,750
I think this is the one.

831
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,950
- We good?

832
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,950
- Yeah.

833
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,670
Hey, you wanna get in there,

834
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,670
give it a whirl?

835
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,790
All right, let me give it a try.

836
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,790
- Ready?

837
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,790
- Ready.

838
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,470
- Nothing?

839
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,470
- Try again.

840
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,510
- Nothing.

841
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,510
- All right.

842
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,980
Maybe if we all pushed?

843
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,990
All right. It's worth a try.

844
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,230
Any other ideas,

845
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,230
you just shout them out.

846
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,470
Not at the moment, I don't.

847
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,270
You coming?

848
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,350
So far, so good.

849
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,350
Give me a status.

850
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:48,590
We're at 300 gallons and counting.

851
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,630
Water is going....

852
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,990
Now.

853
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:02,070
Water's going in now.

854
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:02,070
We're going with water now.

855
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,430
- Good?

856
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,430
- Yeah.

857
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,350
All right.

858
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,840
One, two, three.

859
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,920
You did remember

860
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,920
to put it in neutral, right?

861
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,710
Yeah, man. Give me a little credit.

862
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,470
You sure you're not out of gas?

863
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:14,070
I got a full tank here.

864
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:17,030
Yeah, this doesn't make any sense.

865
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:17,030
Everything looks good.

866
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,390
Why don't we just keep going over it?

867
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,430
There's gotta be

868
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,430
something loose somewhere.

869
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:32,350
Damn, buddy. Picked a hell of a place

870
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:32,350
to break down.

871
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:35,430
I know, right? Crazy.

872
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:35,430
Hey, you know anything about engines?

873
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:38,910
Not a whole lot. I can push you off

874
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:38,910
the tracks at least.

875
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:41,230
Gee, I wouldn't want you

876
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:41,230
to mess up your ride.

877
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:44,870
- I'll go slow. Won't get a scratch.

878
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:44,870
- You'll screw up your nice shiny bumper.

879
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:48,390
Hey. We're running late because of you.

880
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:48,390
The man said it was no problem.

881
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,750
Come on already.

882
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,750
And thank you, by the way.

883
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,630
Yeah, yeah. Absolutely, pal. Thanks.

884
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:21,230
Jesus. Walter, we've got

885
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:21,230
a Good Samaritan on the scene.

886
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,830
You pull your guys

887
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,830
off that train right now.

888
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,480
We're not done yet.

889
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,750
The track is clear, Walter.

890
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,750
I said get out of there.

891
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:00,670
- Thank you, mister. Much obliged.

892
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:00,670
- Glad we could work that out for you.

893
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,430
- Yeah, no problem.

894
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,430
- You want a ride into town?

895
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,950
Yeah. Yeah. Thanks.

896
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:16,310
Walter, they are back in the locomotive.

897
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,990
If you do not abort right now,

898
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,990
you are gonna get us all busted.

899
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,670
- Ready?

900
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,670
- Yeah.

901
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,110
Mr. White!

902
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:45,260
Hey!

903
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,230
Hold it! Hold it steady!

904
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,670
Now!

905
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:59,040
Close it off! Close it off!

906
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:44,950
Todd! Get off! Get off!

907
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,870
Yeah, bitch!

908
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,910
- We did it.

909
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,910
- Oh, yeah!

910
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,950
Oh, my....

911
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:30,470
- Okay, okay. Nice job.

912
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:30,470
- Yeah!

913
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:08,990
No! No! No!

914
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:12,950
No.
