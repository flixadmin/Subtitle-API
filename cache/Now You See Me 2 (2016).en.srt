1
00:00:29,447 --> 00:00:34,285
Excuse me. Sorry. I'm sorry.

2
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:36,078
Excuse me. Coming through.

3
00:00:37,997 --> 00:00:39,874
{\an8}<i>Tonight, so-called
magician Lionel Shrike</i>

4
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:42,460
{\an8}<i>is making another sad
attempt for attention</i>

5
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:45,880
{\an8}<i>by performing what he calls
an impossible feat.</i>

6
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:48,257
{\an8}<i>The safe is made of
the strongest iron.</i>

7
00:00:49,425 --> 00:00:52,553
{\an8}<i>It can't be sawed through or pried.</i>

8
00:00:52,637 --> 00:00:56,933
{\an8}<i>Yet, Lionel Shrike thinks
he's able to escape.</i>

9
00:00:57,016 --> 00:00:58,851
Dad! Dad!

10
00:01:00,353 --> 00:01:03,689
Hey, buddy.
You made it, huh?

11
00:01:03,773 --> 00:01:07,151
Now, see that seat there?

12
00:01:07,235 --> 00:01:08,736
It's the best seat in the house.

13
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:13,032
Is Lionel Shrike the kind
of magician who can pull this off?

14
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:15,993
{\an8}<i>Or is he actually
in over his head?</i>

15
00:01:16,077 --> 00:01:17,662
We'll see about that.

16
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:20,081
- What's the matter?
- I don't want you to go.

17
00:01:20,164 --> 00:01:22,333
Dylan, come on.
We talked about this.

18
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:24,710
Remember?
This is what I do.

19
00:01:24,794 --> 00:01:27,296
I got to prove all
those naysayers wrong.

20
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:30,174
Okay? Besides...

21
00:01:30,258 --> 00:01:33,302
I always keep something up my sleeve.

22
00:01:33,386 --> 00:01:35,471
Now, got your watch
like your dad's?

23
00:01:36,222 --> 00:01:39,016
- Okay. How many seconds?
- Three hundred.

24
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,769
Three hundred. Maybe a few less.

25
00:01:45,064 --> 00:01:46,983
I love you so much.

26
00:01:48,818 --> 00:01:51,696
Okay. See you later, big man.

27
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:56,409
Ladies and gentlemen,
Lionel Shrike!

28
00:01:57,994 --> 00:01:59,954
Will he be able
to hold his breath?

29
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:03,708
{\an8}Will he be able to
somehow escape the safe?

30
00:02:07,128 --> 00:02:09,505
{\an8}Three, two, one...

31
00:02:14,927 --> 00:02:16,345
Two, three,

32
00:02:16,429 --> 00:02:21,017
four, five, six, seven, eight...

33
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:28,899
296... 297, 298, 299, 300.

34
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:35,114
303, 304...

35
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,867
{\an8}<i>It's five minutes now,</i>

36
00:02:38,868 --> 00:02:43,331
{\an8}<i>and we have not seen or heard
anything from Lionel Shrike yet.</i>

37
00:02:43,414 --> 00:02:44,540
Move!

38
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,001
{\an8}Dad!

39
00:02:48,294 --> 00:02:50,755
Dad! Dad!

40
00:02:52,715 --> 00:02:54,091
Let go of me!

41
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:56,093
Dad!

42
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:59,221
No! Dad!

43
00:03:00,348 --> 00:03:02,391
Dad! Let go!

44
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:04,769
Find him!

45
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:26,165
<i>The Eye.</i>

46
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:28,876
<i>It may not lie...</i>

47
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,463
<i>But don't think for a moment
that it can't be lied to.</i>

48
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:37,093
<i>Seeing is believing.</i>

49
00:03:37,176 --> 00:03:39,095
<i>But is it truth?</i>

50
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:42,890
{\an8}<i>People see the Horsemen
as noble Robin Hoods. Are they?</i>

51
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:46,435
{\an8}<i>Or are they common thieves?</i>

52
00:03:47,603 --> 00:03:48,813
{\an8}<i>Depends on your point of view.</i>

53
00:03:49,522 --> 00:03:51,023
{\an8}<i>Here's what you know.</i>

54
00:03:51,107 --> 00:03:54,693
<i>They robbed a bank in Paris
from a stage in Las Vegas.</i>

55
00:03:54,777 --> 00:03:56,404
<i>They fleeced
an insurance magnate</i>

56
00:03:56,487 --> 00:03:58,030
<i>of hundreds of
millions of dollars</i>

57
00:03:58,114 --> 00:04:00,741
<i>and disappeared from
a roof in New York.</i>

58
00:04:00,825 --> 00:04:05,079
<i>Always showering their
devoted fans with money.</i>

59
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:07,039
<i>Here's what you don't know.</i>

60
00:04:07,123 --> 00:04:09,250
<i>They left one man behind.</i>

61
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:12,753
<i>Framed. Holding the bag. Me.</i>

62
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,715
<i>Are you listening, Horsemen?</i>

63
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:19,969
<i>When you emerge, and you will,</i>

64
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:24,098
<i>I will be there waiting.</i>

65
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:29,395
<i>Because mark my words,
you will get what's coming to you.</i>

66
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:31,856
<i>In ways you can't expect.</i>

67
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,859
<i>But very much deserve.</i>

68
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:41,740
<i>Because one thing I believe in
is an eye for an eye.</i>

69
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:01,028
<i>Welcome, Daniel Atlas.</i>

70
00:06:02,154 --> 00:06:03,447
Who am I speaking to?

71
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,909
I asked to see the face
behind all of this.

72
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:12,289
<i>You've asked many questions.
And registered many complaints.</i>

73
00:06:12,373 --> 00:06:14,291
<i>You can rest assured
that we've heard you.</i>

74
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:15,876
Have you? Because I don't...

75
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,294
<i>- Trust?
- No.</i>

76
00:06:17,378 --> 00:06:20,089
<i>Your leader?
Your fellow Horsemen?</i>

77
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:21,632
<i>Perhaps even us?</i>

78
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:25,678
I don't like that we've been
living in hiding for a year.

79
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:27,972
I don't like that every message
I get from Dylan is,

80
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:30,683
"Wait. Be patient.
The Eye has a plan."

81
00:06:30,766 --> 00:06:33,143
<i>Wait. Be patient.</i>

82
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:34,436
<i>The Eye has a plan.</i>

83
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,481
This is games
and it's not working for me.

84
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:42,486
<i>You feel it is you who should be
leading the Horsemen, not Dylan.</i>

85
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:48,033
<i>If that is what you desire,
stay the course.</i>

86
00:06:48,117 --> 00:06:50,119
<i>Trust that your unique talents</i>

87
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:53,998
<i>and remarkable mind
will not go unrecognized.</i>

88
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:56,667
<i>We have a new mission
for the Horsemen.</i>

89
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,837
<i>Dylan has a plan
and will gather you together soon.</i>

90
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:02,715
<i>Now leave!</i>

91
00:07:16,729 --> 00:07:19,523
North Carolina,
Florida, Maryland, Maine.

92
00:07:19,607 --> 00:07:21,483
We're talking the entire
eastern seaboard.

93
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:23,485
I need to see some results.

94
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:25,362
Oh, hey. Oh, sorry.

95
00:07:25,446 --> 00:07:27,549
Just real quick. Can I have you
for a couple of minutes?

96
00:07:27,573 --> 00:07:29,259
I'm right in the middle
of something, Dylan.

97
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:31,963
No, I know. It's okay. Hey. Hey,
everybody. Sorry. Sorry about that.

98
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,288
Call the mayor.

99
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:36,749
Thanks a lot.
Twins, huh? Good.

100
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,001
Is he coming?

101
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:41,170
Look, I wouldn't have
brought you out of that meeting

102
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:42,713
unless it was something important.

103
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:45,174
It's about the Horsemen.

104
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:48,385
Something's happening here
and it's happening now.

105
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:51,180
Message boards.
Elite magic society.

106
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:53,682
There is chatter going on
about the Horsemen

107
00:07:53,766 --> 00:07:57,019
and something happening with Octa,
the giant software company.

108
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:58,103
I know what Octa is.

109
00:07:58,187 --> 00:07:59,855
I'm sorry, ma'am,
but two months ago

110
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:01,899
we sent men to Philadelphia
because he knew...

111
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:04,276
- And I said that I was wrong.
- He knew that the Horsemen

112
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,004
were going to hit
the Euro-Atlantic Banking Summit.

113
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:07,088
- I have proof.
- Let him talk.

114
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:09,323
Thank you.
Communications.

115
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:13,410
Contact between who I think
might be Daniel Atlas

116
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:16,163
and who may be Merritt McKinney.

117
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:19,583
And what do you have?
Emails? Cell phones? Any transcripts?

118
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:21,835
- Pigeons.
- What?

119
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,213
I'm sorry,
you mean stool pigeons?

120
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:26,924
No, I mean actual pigeon pigeons.
Like carrier pigeons.

121
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:29,968
- Okay? Magicians work with pigeons.
- Doves.

122
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:32,471
Stay with me.

123
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:35,766
This pigeon, right here...

124
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,435
There's Daniel Atlas.
Same pigeon.

125
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:39,603
East Village.

126
00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:41,271
Same pigeon, West Village.

127
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:44,108
42nd Street, pigeon. 65th Street.

128
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:47,069
All the way up to the
George Washington Bridge

129
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:51,740
on a sail boat with a guy that looks
just like Merritt McKinney.

130
00:08:51,824 --> 00:08:53,242
And what does this all mean?

131
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:55,744
I know what it means.
It means nothing. It's bullshit.

132
00:08:55,828 --> 00:08:57,538
- Could you sing a new song?
- No.

133
00:08:57,621 --> 00:08:59,541
How is it that two years ago
you were so close...

134
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:02,394
{\an8}You think I went out of my way
to screw up my own investigation?

135
00:09:02,418 --> 00:09:03,645
You think I'm
that big of an idiot?

136
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:05,230
You know What I think now?
I think you're smart,

137
00:09:05,254 --> 00:09:06,481
but you want everybody else
to think that you're an idiot.

138
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:08,465
Okay, stop.

139
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:11,593
Cowan, I know I'm new here,
but as far as I can tell,

140
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:13,929
people who don't even know you,
think you're an asshole.

141
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,306
- And you?
- Ma'am.

142
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:20,310
You don't know me, but my first year
in the Academy, you gave a talk.

143
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:24,815
The "long game" you called it.
You talked about a moral compass.

144
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,067
About how you believed
in yours immutably.

145
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:34,241
And I thought to myself, "That guy.
One day, I want to be that guy."

146
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:38,412
And now... A pigeon?

147
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,724
Technically, it was a few pigeons,
but I hear what you're saying.

148
00:09:40,748 --> 00:09:42,291
Okay. So here's what I'm going to do.

149
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:45,377
You want to take a vacation day?
Go on your own? Fine.

150
00:09:45,461 --> 00:09:48,756
But I'm not going to devote resources
to another snipe hunt.

151
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,967
I came to clean this mess up,
not add to it. I'm sorry.

152
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:55,512
Boss, thank you. I promise you,
it won't be a snipe hunt.

153
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:57,639
We're gonna get those Horsemen.

154
00:09:58,056 --> 00:09:59,141
She's great.

155
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:02,394
The problem is when you're
two people at the same time,

156
00:10:02,478 --> 00:10:03,997
one of them is bound
to trip the other.

157
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:07,232
And when that happens,
I will be there.

158
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:09,067
Duly noted.

159
00:10:30,506 --> 00:10:32,090
- Oh. Hi!
- Who are you?

160
00:10:32,174 --> 00:10:33,902
- What are you doing in my...
- It's actually a funny story.

161
00:10:33,926 --> 00:10:35,511
How did you get into my apartment?
Whoa!

162
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:37,888
I think it's funny.
It's not like funny "ha ha."

163
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,098
Or you might not think
that it's funny "ha ha."

164
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:42,434
I think it's funny.
I guess it's all kind of relative.

165
00:10:42,518 --> 00:10:44,436
I was actually...
No, that's not...

166
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:48,065
I made myself in the neighbourhood
and now I'm here, and maybe...

167
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,069
Okay.

168
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:53,421
Seriously, how did you get in here?

169
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:55,822
Are you some kind of
crazed fan or something?

170
00:10:55,906 --> 00:10:57,824
Oh, my God.
No, no, no, I recognize you.

171
00:10:57,908 --> 00:11:01,078
You did that B-grade "geek magic“ thing,
didn't you? You pulled a...

172
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:02,401
Pulled a hat out of the rabbit.

173
00:11:02,454 --> 00:11:03,723
A hat out of the rabbit, that's right.

174
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:04,831
I know that it didn't work.

175
00:11:04,915 --> 00:11:06,059
No, it was actually
kind of disgusting.

176
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,501
It was way worse for the rabbit.

177
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:11,004
Well, your drop was obvious
and your body shell is flimsy.

178
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:14,424
So if you wouldn't mind crawling out
from under my couch and...

179
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:20,722
Ta-da! Now I'm sitting
over here. Crazy!

180
00:11:20,806 --> 00:11:24,476
By the way, that rabbit thing?
That was eight years ago, okay?

181
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,228
I've gotten so much
better since then.

182
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:27,646
- Have you?
- Yeah.

183
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:29,290
Okay, come here.
What is it that you want?

184
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:30,941
I wanted to meet you.
Everybody, really.

185
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,651
I want to be a part
of the Eye, okay?

186
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:35,404
I said it. I do.
And I want to use my magic for good,

187
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:39,157
like you and Merritt
and Jack especially.

188
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:41,243
Oh, that's right.
I know that Jack is alive.

189
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:42,637
I know that he
faked his own death.

190
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:45,539
I am a huge fan of faking deaths.
That was crazy!

191
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,165
What is this?
A trucker's hitch?

192
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:49,001
- Yeah.
- It's terrible.

193
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:51,169
- Embarrassing.
- Okay.

194
00:11:51,253 --> 00:11:54,214
By the way, I am so sorry
that Henley left you.

195
00:11:54,298 --> 00:11:56,091
- God!
- Sorry.

196
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:58,760
That's actually a little better.
You know what I heard?

197
00:11:58,844 --> 00:11:59,970
- What?
- About Henley?

198
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,556
I heard that she got tired
of waiting around.

199
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,142
She lost faith
and so she asked for an out,

200
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,102
and the Eye gave it to her.

201
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:08,437
But who knows, right?

202
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,480
In matters of the heart,
so difficult to tell.

203
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:13,025
I mean, maybe she got sick of you.
You ever think about that?

204
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:14,443
Control issues?

205
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:16,337
Maybe you just didn't
tie her up tight enough. Ow!

206
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:17,738
Here's what's going to happen.

207
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:20,115
You're going to stay
here and stop talking,

208
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:21,658
and I'm going to
make a phone call,

209
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:24,077
and in about five minutes,
some people are going...

210
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:32,461
It's all in the wrist.

211
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:35,881
Let the momentum
of the card do the work for you.

212
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:38,967
This last one I call the Stall.

213
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,347
Not bad.

214
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,015
Now you want to see
a thing of beauty?

215
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,808
- I do indeed.
- Here you go.

216
00:12:46,892 --> 00:12:49,102
And bingo bango bongo.

217
00:12:51,063 --> 00:12:53,815
That's good. No, no, no,
it's good to be positive

218
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:55,419
despite making zero
progress in a year.

219
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:56,526
Yeah.

220
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,528
Whereas when it
comes to hypnotism,

221
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:01,031
the student has almost
become the master.

222
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:05,702
I like your confidence, but you might
say that you have the better teacher.

223
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:06,870
Yeah.

224
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,163
You're right.
You're right.

225
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:10,499
Your teacher definitely doesn't
know what he's doing.

226
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:12,501
By the way, was this
your card yesterday?

227
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:14,961
- In fact it was.
- I thought so.

228
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:16,588
That's not bad.

229
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:24,096
If I can hypnotize Danny
before you hit him with a card,

230
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:25,472
I get top bunk for a week.

231
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:27,474
Okay, that's a deal.

232
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:28,975
- Danny, what's up, man?
- Hey.

233
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:31,079
Stare at the palm of your hand
and as your eyes change focus,

234
00:13:31,103 --> 00:13:32,437
you will begin to notice...

235
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:33,581
Everything, because
I'm not hypnotized.

236
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:36,650
It's not working.
Please don't become him.

237
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:38,402
I didn't know you guys did party tricks

238
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,213
when there weren't floozies around
to impress.

239
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:44,700
Uh, I think we stopped trying to
impress floozies in, like, 1937.

240
00:13:44,783 --> 00:13:46,827
Okay, somebody broke into my apartment,
all right?

241
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,662
Some amateur who knew
everything about me,

242
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:51,289
everything about Henley leaving,
and everything about us.

243
00:13:51,373 --> 00:13:54,042
- That's her.
- Hey!

244
00:13:54,126 --> 00:13:56,378
- Hi.
- You met Lula.

245
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:58,964
I've met her.
What is she doing here?

246
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:04,136
I'm the new Horseman!
I'm the girl Horseman.

247
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:06,888
Yeah!

248
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:10,517
Nobody. No excitement.
Jack? Anything?

249
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,561
Dylan, tell me
what's going on here.

250
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:17,232
Well, Lula's been on the underground
scene for the last decade,

251
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:18,942
and I think she
has some real talent,

252
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,027
and I'd like to try her on stage

253
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:23,238
- to balance out the duo.
- What?

254
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:24,656
No, are you serious, man?

255
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,759
After Henley left, you said I could
get back on stage again.

256
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:28,201
Not someone who just showed up.

257
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:30,120
I told you I'd think about it,
and I have,

258
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,473
and I really need you behind the scenes
with me for a little while longer.

259
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:34,726
Dylan, come on. I've been
behind the scenes my whole life.

260
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:38,503
Which is a crime, might I add.
Have you seen that man's face?

261
00:14:38,587 --> 00:14:42,382
Much as I appreciate the addition
of some femininity to the group,

262
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:44,718
over and above what Atlas provides,

263
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:47,137
I think the real issue
is we've been in this...

264
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,556
Yeah, the issue is that
we have been rehearsing for months

265
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:52,309
for something...
We don't even know what it is.

266
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:53,828
And you're going to
keep working until...

267
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:55,872
Until we work as a single organism.
I know, I've heard you say that.

268
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:57,123
The thing is, when you say that,

269
00:14:57,147 --> 00:14:59,649
I think what you're
referring to is us, not you.

270
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:02,110
Listen, I'm getting my orders
directly from the Eye.

271
00:15:02,194 --> 00:15:03,653
Okay? And then I give them to you.

272
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:05,298
Now, if you don't like that,
you're welcome to go.

273
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:08,083
No, I'm not going anywhere. But I'm...
Mmm. I'm taking care of myself.

274
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:09,510
Guys, can I just
weigh in here really quickly?

275
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:11,053
Because I think I see
what's going on here.

276
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:13,914
You guys are this amazing,
tight-knit family unit.

277
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:16,333
- I'm a new person...
- We are anything but a family.

278
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:20,420
Okay, well, my mother literally
knifed my father in the neck one time.

279
00:15:20,504 --> 00:15:22,523
So you are actually
a little bit like my family unit.

280
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:23,799
- Literally?
- But, yeah.

281
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:25,801
It was an accident, I think.

282
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:28,929
Okay. So, does this mean
we're actually going to do something?

283
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:31,097
Yes.

284
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:35,602
You've all heard of Octa
and their playboy CEO, Owen Case.

285
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:38,230
His partner, Walter Mabry,
died about a year ago.

286
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:40,082
You wanna know what all this
has been leading to?

287
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:41,149
Yeah.

288
00:15:41,233 --> 00:15:43,610
Octa's hosting the launch
of the next-gen cell phone.

289
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:45,153
Once these phones
hit the streets,

290
00:15:45,237 --> 00:15:48,073
they'll siphon their users'
information to the black market.

291
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:51,827
Meaning Octa's selling privacy
to up their profit.

292
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,830
So, the Eye has decided
to expose them for it.

293
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:56,998
Our mission
is to hijack the show.

294
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,751
Rehearsal's over, guys.

295
00:15:59,835 --> 00:16:01,503
This is what we've
been waiting for.

296
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:03,046
Now it's time to get to work.

297
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:14,140
<i>Welcome, Octa insiders,
bloggers and journalists.</i>

298
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:17,519
<i>We're delighted that you've joined us
to participate in our special event.</i>

299
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:21,606
<i>Today marks the beginning of a bright
new journey in social networking.</i>

300
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,316
<i>Our latest product, Octa 8...</i>

301
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,152
Keys, cell phones,
iPads, in the bin.

302
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:28,113
Thank you, sir.

303
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:32,659
Can't have you texting,
tweeting, recording, or eating.

304
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:35,412
Sorry, we will take very good
care of it for you.

305
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:38,164
Oh, by the way.

306
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:39,916
Security memo from Case himself.

307
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,461
Couple of surprise guests.
Just follow his lead, yeah?

308
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:45,463
We're all good.
I'm heading to the control room.

309
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:47,048
All right. Thanks, Jack.

310
00:16:47,883 --> 00:16:51,511
- Atlas, go.
- No, Dylan, I can't...

311
00:16:51,595 --> 00:16:53,955
- <i>What? What's the problem?</i>
- No, there's too many people...

312
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:56,308
Atlas, I got Owen landing now.

313
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:57,809
Okay, I'm going now.

314
00:16:57,893 --> 00:16:59,519
- Stop.
- Oh.

315
00:17:00,896 --> 00:17:02,397
- Okay.
- Thanks.

316
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,774
Pascal, we need you in the kitchen.

317
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:24,711
Look, the speech is about freedom, okay?

318
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:26,480
That's what we're trying
to sell here, is freedom.

319
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:27,940
Which part of that
do you not understand?

320
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:29,442
- I know, I'm sorry.
- For goodness sake!

321
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:32,093
Mr. Case, John from legal.
Just need your signature for release.

322
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:33,803
Thank you so much.

323
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:35,972
Just get it done
and get it back to me.

324
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:44,564
Hey there, buddy! Smile!

325
00:17:44,648 --> 00:17:46,483
- Who are you? What the hell?
- Who am I?

326
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,902
It is picture day.
Did Julie not tell you it's picture day?

327
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:50,796
- Picture day? What are you...
- Company-wide policy.

328
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,632
- Look, I got a job to do.
- I have a job to do, too.

329
00:17:52,656 --> 00:17:53,856
Hold on a second.
What is that?

330
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:55,009
I'm going to need some backup here.

331
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:56,218
Who are you calling?
Hey! That's my ID.

332
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:57,327
Security, my name is...

333
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,930
- Bo Walsh, thank you.
- Hey, I'm Bo Walsh!

334
00:17:58,954 --> 00:18:00,330
Not this guy.
He's not Bo Walsh.

335
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:01,414
Calm down, please.

336
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:03,041
Hey! Hey, what's going on?

337
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:04,685
This guy just came and
put a flash light in my eyes.

338
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:06,920
I'm trying to do my job.
This guy, check his badge.

339
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:08,683
- Who is this guy?
- I'm Bo Walsh, not him.

340
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:10,715
It says here,
"Evans Mental Facility.

341
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,276
- Mark D. Stooge."
- Hold on a second.

342
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,361
I've never seen
this before in my life.

343
00:18:13,385 --> 00:18:14,594
I'm sorry, Mr. Walsh.

344
00:18:14,678 --> 00:18:15,988
- Come on, Mr. Stooge.
- Hold on. He's not Mr. Walsh!

345
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:17,806
- Come on. Let's go.
- What's going on here?

346
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:19,641
I'm Bo Walsh, not him!

347
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:23,979
God, you cannot trust anybody
in this city anymore, can you?

348
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:25,862
Get off me!
Look, I want to make a phone call.

349
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:27,833
- I want to call my boss!
- Hey, hey! What's going on?

350
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:29,818
I want to call my boss,
and this jackass...

351
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:31,837
Hey! Make your phone call.
That's your right, sir.

352
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:34,072
That's my right.

353
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:35,991
- What the hell?
- You're crazy. Let's go.

354
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:37,701
This isn't my...
Where's my phone?

355
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:39,494
Where's my phone?

356
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:41,329
Atlas, Stooge has left
the building.

357
00:18:41,413 --> 00:18:42,664
Okay.

358
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:45,417
The circuit board is ours.
I am leaving backstage.

359
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:50,130
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, Owen Case.</i>

360
00:18:50,213 --> 00:18:52,799
All right. Lula, show these guys
what you're made of.

361
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:02,559
I can take over from here.
Clark says you're on break.

362
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:03,935
What break? Who's Clark?

363
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:05,645
"Who's Clark?" That's funny.

364
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:08,064
Imagine if I told Roger that,
he'd freak out.

365
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:10,066
- Don't do that!
- What?

366
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,484
Who the hell is Roger?

367
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:13,129
Does Lisa know that
you don't know Roger?

368
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:14,505
- I don't know who Lisa is.
- Are you kidding again?

369
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:16,549
- You don't know who Lisa is now?
- No, I don't. Just get away.

370
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:18,742
- That is a dangerous...
- You're ruining the meat.

371
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:20,368
Don't make me have to go to Brian!

372
00:19:20,452 --> 00:19:22,013
- I don't know who Brian is!
- Why are you acting like this?

373
00:19:22,037 --> 00:19:23,557
- I'll go straight to him.
- Give me...

374
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,458
Oh, my God!

375
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,837
<i>What are you doing to me?</i>

376
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:33,298
- Help me!
- Help her. Go!

377
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:37,177
Have some water.

378
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,971
I feel from your face
you're freaked by the flow of blood,

379
00:19:40,055 --> 00:19:41,681
which is fully fixable in a snap

380
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:45,268
by focusing and following
the flow of my words

381
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:47,645
as you're flowing and floating,

382
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:50,648
which is why you're focusing
on my commands.

383
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:52,108
You got this far in life

384
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:54,819
by listening to one voice,
the voice in your head.

385
00:19:54,903 --> 00:19:56,780
This is that voice.

386
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:00,658
Look at the light.

387
00:20:00,742 --> 00:20:03,578
Listen to your own voice.

388
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:09,709
Oh, my God.

389
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:16,132
Wow. What is that?
Is that a miracle towel?

390
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:17,884
Thank you so much.
Do you know what?

391
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:21,387
You have taught me that I'm not
cut out for this kind of work.

392
00:20:21,471 --> 00:20:23,098
I quit!

393
00:20:23,181 --> 00:20:24,891
Get another towel.

394
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:27,310
Thank you, and goodbye.

395
00:20:28,186 --> 00:20:29,354
Oh, God.

396
00:20:31,523 --> 00:20:33,733
Welcome everybody!

397
00:20:33,817 --> 00:20:36,736
And now, the moment
that you've all been waiting for...

398
00:20:37,946 --> 00:20:39,906
- Nice work, lady.
- Thanks.

399
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:43,034
Revolutionized music with Octa 2.

400
00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:47,705
I'm actually nervous,
and I'm not even going onstage.

401
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:49,999
You know, I've heard
that if you're nervous,

402
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:53,086
it can be really helpful
to picture each other naked.

403
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:54,921
It's actually picture
the audience naked.

404
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:56,673
No, this is new.
This is a new science.

405
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:58,091
So, I don't know.

406
00:20:58,174 --> 00:21:01,344
- Do you want... We should try it.
- Not the right mood.

407
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:03,054
Guess that leaves
you and me, old buddy.

408
00:21:03,138 --> 00:21:05,932
What? Picture each other...
No. No, thank you.

409
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,977
I mean, I admit,
from the neck up there are issues.

410
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:12,147
But from the neck down, the David.

411
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:13,690
Owen Case.

412
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:17,068
Good morning, Octa-lites.

413
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:19,154
Good morning, Octa-lites.

414
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:21,698
Now, I've made the claim...

415
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:24,534
<i>Now, I've made the claim
that Octa 8 is pure magic.</i>

416
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:27,620
But the truth is, that's just
one of those things I say...

417
00:21:27,704 --> 00:21:31,124
<i>You know, the truth is,
that's just one of those things I say...</i>

418
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:33,459
when in fact
I mean something else.

419
00:21:33,543 --> 00:21:37,714
<i>When in fact
I mean something else.</i>

420
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,090
What else do I mean?

421
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:45,430
<i>Well, here to fill you in on some of my
fabulous lies and hypocrisy,</i>

422
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:49,475
<i>and to perform some of the most dazzling
feats of magic you have ever seen...</i>

423
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:52,145
<i>- They are the world's...
- Greatest magicians.</i>

424
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:54,981
<i>Here to expose me
for the fraud I truly am.</i>

425
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:59,402
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
here are the Horsemen.</i>

426
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:15,001
Hello, New York!

427
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:17,003
Thank you so much.

428
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:18,838
Hey, it's great to be back.

429
00:22:18,922 --> 00:22:22,217
And have you met
our newest Horseman, Lula?

430
00:22:25,428 --> 00:22:29,265
- Feels good, right?
- Pretty good. Pretty good.

431
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:33,478
Thank you, thank you. Um, okay.

432
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:35,313
We want to talk to you
about your privacy.

433
00:22:35,396 --> 00:22:37,398
What does your privacy mean to you?

434
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:40,235
Because apparently to Owen Case,
it means absolutely nothing.

435
00:22:40,318 --> 00:22:42,779
No, actually it means less
than absolutely nothing.

436
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:45,907
You see, he's mocked your privacy.
He's scorned it.

437
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:49,030
Right, and we're not just talking about
the things that you already agreed to

438
00:22:49,077 --> 00:22:51,287
when you signed,
probably without reading

439
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:54,540
the terms and conditions
of Octas 1 through 7.

440
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:01,130
Dylan, the FBI is here.

441
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:03,508
All right. Don't worry about it.

442
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:05,593
All right, go to plan C-4.

443
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:08,721
Look the doors.

444
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:10,390
Hey, boss, I'm glad you're here.

445
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:11,891
Don't.

446
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:15,061
Guys, look. We got to move
around, get in through the back.

447
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:16,437
These Horsemen are tricky, okay?

448
00:23:16,521 --> 00:23:19,607
They got backup plans
on top of backup plans.

449
00:23:19,691 --> 00:23:21,734
Hey, sorry, don't mean to gloat,
but I told you so.

450
00:23:21,818 --> 00:23:22,986
Cut the bullshit, Rhodes.

451
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:25,238
We got an anonymous
phone call an hour ago.

452
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:26,990
Confirms everything
I've been telling her.

453
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:28,133
What are you talking about?

454
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:29,551
You sent agents
to Detroit and Philadelphia.

455
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:31,828
You've been crying wolf
so we wouldn't send them here.

456
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:34,539
- Boss, please.
- Keep working on the doors.

457
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:38,543
Please tell me that you haven't bought
into Cowan's crazy, paranoid fantasia.

458
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:40,211
Before we start the show...

459
00:23:40,295 --> 00:23:44,007
We had Owen agree to a few terms
and conditions of our own.

460
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:47,093
So, everything that he had
once considered private...

461
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:51,723
That he thinks is really private...

462
00:23:51,806 --> 00:23:55,768
Yeah, everything that he once
considered private is now...

463
00:23:55,852 --> 00:23:57,186
Oh, my.

464
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:05,987
<i>As the Horsemen like to say,
magic is about controlling perception.</i>

465
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:10,116
<i>You see them as champions of the truth,
but are they?</i>

466
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:13,119
<i>Or is that just another
one of their illusions?</i>

467
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:15,747
- What's going on, Rhodes?
- This is crazy.

468
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,349
We got to get everyone
to the other exits.

469
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:19,959
- Let's go, to the back.
- No. You stay here.

470
00:24:20,043 --> 00:24:22,253
<i>So, since they clearly
love secrets...</i>

471
00:24:22,337 --> 00:24:24,839
<i>Let's reveal some of theirs.</i>

472
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:26,632
Danny, everyone, get off the stage.

473
00:24:26,716 --> 00:24:27,925
<i>Abort.</i>

474
00:24:28,843 --> 00:24:31,512
Jack, go with them.
I'll see you at the meet-up point.

475
00:24:31,596 --> 00:24:32,597
Let's go.

476
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,807
<i>Do you recall the death of Jack Wilder?</i>

477
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:40,313
<i>What if I told you he's not just alive,
but he's actually right here.</i>

478
00:24:46,861 --> 00:24:50,156
<i>And do you know who else is here?
The FBI.</i>

479
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:52,450
<i>Let's let them in, shall we?</i>

480
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:55,661
<i>And now, for the big reveal.</i>

481
00:24:55,745 --> 00:24:58,414
Go! Go! To the stage.

482
00:24:58,498 --> 00:25:00,541
<i>There's a fifth Horseman,</i>

483
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:03,419
<i>and he's the biggest
criminal of them ail.</i>

484
00:25:03,503 --> 00:25:06,130
<i>FBI agent, Dylan Rhodes.</i>

485
00:25:07,715 --> 00:25:09,384
- I knew it.
- What?

486
00:25:10,885 --> 00:25:12,565
This is so much deeper
than you know, boss.

487
00:25:12,595 --> 00:25:14,823
You think you're looking at one thing,
but you have no idea.

488
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:17,266
- Who are you?
- The same man I've always been.

489
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:19,185
Boys, I'm sorry.

490
00:25:27,777 --> 00:25:29,487
You gotta be kidding me.

491
00:25:29,654 --> 00:25:31,614
We've gotta get to the chute. Go!

492
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:34,450
- Who are those guys?
- Who cares? Come on!

493
00:25:34,534 --> 00:25:35,701
- Hurry, hurry!
- Keep going!

494
00:25:35,785 --> 00:25:36,845
How the hell could this happen?

495
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:38,597
I thought Dylan
had everything under control.

496
00:25:38,621 --> 00:25:40,415
Yeah. Apparently he didn't.

497
00:25:40,498 --> 00:25:43,543
Maybe you're the leak, Dan.
Where you been sneaking off to?

498
00:25:43,626 --> 00:25:45,187
Don't you dare for a second
insinuate that I had...

499
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:48,589
- I'm not insinuating. That's your...
- Let's get to the truck, come on!

500
00:25:48,673 --> 00:25:50,842
- Stay together!
- Move! Move!

501
00:25:50,925 --> 00:25:51,968
Lula, come on!

502
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:53,970
Coming! Whoa!

503
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:06,274
<i>Sleep. Sleep. Sleep. Sleep.</i>

504
00:26:16,784 --> 00:26:18,244
What the hell is going on?

505
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:20,807
- Wasn't there supposed to be a truck?
- Where the hell are we?

506
00:26:22,874 --> 00:26:24,125
Come on!

507
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:26,085
Hey, hey!
Wait, did you mis-run the tube?

508
00:26:26,169 --> 00:26:27,795
No, I put it in the truck.
I know I did!

509
00:26:27,879 --> 00:26:29,481
Because we're really
not in the truck right now.

510
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:30,840
Somebody must
have moved the tube.

511
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:32,443
Were we above a Chinese restaurant?
Give me that!

512
00:26:32,467 --> 00:26:34,510
- I'm moving! Relax!
- There's something very wrong.

513
00:26:37,388 --> 00:26:39,599
Okay. Why are we here?

514
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:41,642
Why am I frickin' starving?

515
00:26:41,726 --> 00:26:43,853
Yeah, I'm weirdly starving, too.

516
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:46,189
This makes no sense.

517
00:27:10,171 --> 00:27:11,506
Okay, sorry.

518
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:15,176
At least, and I know this
isn't much consolation,

519
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:17,970
but apparently
we're now surrounded by Chinese food.

520
00:27:18,054 --> 00:27:20,306
- Right?
- Guys...

521
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:23,976
I think where we are right now, they
don't refer to it as "Chinese food."

522
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:26,771
It's just called "food."

523
00:27:31,025 --> 00:27:33,736
Wait, what are you saying?
How is this possible?

524
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:41,577
I believe in your particular parlance,
the word is "magic."

525
00:27:41,661 --> 00:27:44,163
That guy looks exactly like you.

526
00:27:44,247 --> 00:27:47,291
He looks exactly like you.
Are you seeing this right now?

527
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:48,501
Chase.

528
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:52,547
Must confess, it's like What I heard
about meeting the Rolling Stones.

529
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,549
They're a lot shorter in person.

530
00:27:54,632 --> 00:27:57,468
Remember I told you about the guy
who screwed me out of everything?

531
00:27:57,552 --> 00:28:00,846
This is my twin brother, Chase.

532
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:02,723
Wait, did you do this?

533
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:08,854
As you can see,
my boss don't mess around.

534
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:11,607
I do not understand What is
going on right now. At all.

535
00:28:11,691 --> 00:28:13,776
Okay, let me break it
down for you.

536
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:17,863
You jumped off a rooftop in New York
and you landed in Macau.

537
00:28:17,947 --> 00:28:21,492
AKA the Vegas of China.

538
00:28:21,576 --> 00:28:23,869
And presto-changeo.

539
00:28:23,953 --> 00:28:25,121
Don't you just love it?

540
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:27,290
The "greatest magicians in the world"

541
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:29,834
are the object
of someone else's magic trick?

542
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:32,086
Isn't that poetic?

543
00:28:33,504 --> 00:28:37,758
No? You know what,
I'm not gonna let you guys yuck my yum.

544
00:28:37,842 --> 00:28:40,261
Shoo-Shoo. Or mu-shu. Whatever.

545
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:46,350
Oh, and you know what they say,
"What happens in Macau..."

546
00:28:46,434 --> 00:28:49,687
Well, I don't know the rest of it,
'cause it's in Chinese...

547
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:51,480
Hey, thanks, guys!

548
00:29:12,168 --> 00:29:13,604
{\an8}<i>Reports are coming in
that the infamous Horsemen</i>

549
00:29:13,628 --> 00:29:15,588
{\an8}<i>hijacked the Octa product launch today.</i>

550
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:17,298
{\an8}<i>The trick was on them, however,</i>

551
00:29:17,381 --> 00:29:20,718
{\an8}<i>as we learned of the miraculous
resurrection of Jack Wilder.</i>

552
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:23,846
{\an8}<i>And the stunning revelation
that FBI Agent Dylan Rhodes</i>

553
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:26,349
{\an8}<i>has been working as a mole
within the Bureau.</i>

554
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:29,810
<i>Questions abound today as an
international manhunt is underway</i>

555
00:29:29,894 --> 00:29:33,606
<i>for Dylan Rhodes and his elusive
and criminal band of illusionists.</i>

556
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:37,360
Hey, seriously, where are you guys?

557
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:39,338
I'm at the meetup.
I've been leaving you messages.

558
00:29:39,362 --> 00:29:41,697
I haven't heard from anyone.
Please, call me!

559
00:29:41,781 --> 00:29:42,907
<i>And the stock market</i>

560
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,701
<i>saw big gains and modest
losses on Thursday.</i>

561
00:29:47,161 --> 00:29:48,746
Hey, tell me you're safe.
Where are you?

562
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:53,167
Right where you left me,
18 months ago, Agent Rhodes.

563
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,418
Thaddeus?

564
00:29:54,502 --> 00:29:56,379
<i>How does it feel
to lose everything?</i>

565
00:29:56,462 --> 00:30:00,383
Your job. Your identity.
Your reason for living.

566
00:30:00,466 --> 00:30:03,594
How does it feel to be out of control,
perhaps for the first time?

567
00:30:06,097 --> 00:30:07,181
What do you want?

568
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:09,308
You're a fool, Agent Rhodes.
You always have been.

569
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:13,354
- Where are they?
- I'm not telling you on the phone!

570
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:14,438
Where are they?

571
00:30:14,522 --> 00:30:18,526
And if you're wondering if I was behind
the Horsemen's recent debacle,

572
00:30:18,609 --> 00:30:20,361
I'll let you work
that out for yourself.

573
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:23,447
Hey, I burned you once, I'll burn
you again. I'm not playing, Thaddeus.

574
00:30:23,531 --> 00:30:26,200
It's not my game,
Agent Rhodes. It's yours.

575
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:28,744
You started it when
you looked me in a cell.

576
00:30:28,828 --> 00:30:30,538
<i>This is simply my move.</i>

577
00:30:30,621 --> 00:30:32,581
Next one is yours.

578
00:30:35,918 --> 00:30:37,253
<i>No!</i>

579
00:30:38,087 --> 00:30:39,630
Let go!

580
00:30:40,464 --> 00:30:43,926
Dad! Help me! Dad!

581
00:30:45,094 --> 00:30:46,679
<i>Dad!</i>

582
00:31:04,113 --> 00:31:06,031
It's all about blind spots.

583
00:31:06,115 --> 00:31:10,953
When you're staring straight
at something, and not see it. Why?

584
00:31:11,704 --> 00:31:13,414
Blind spots.

585
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:15,708
We learned that together,
didn't we, bro?

586
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:18,627
Did he tell you that
we were partners once?

587
00:31:18,711 --> 00:31:21,881
No? I didn't think so.
The "Mini-McKinneys."

588
00:31:21,964 --> 00:31:24,300
<i>Chasey and a Mer-Bear</i>

589
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:26,385
<i>Gonna make you scare-bear</i>

590
00:31:26,469 --> 00:31:29,805
<i>Ma-ma-magic McKinneys</i>

591
00:31:30,681 --> 00:31:31,891
Cool.

592
00:31:31,974 --> 00:31:38,564
And then, one day, we were 12
and Virginia von Welsheim

593
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:41,525
had a very nice party
down the street.

594
00:31:41,609 --> 00:31:43,903
I had a little tum-tum, couldn't go.

595
00:31:43,986 --> 00:31:49,533
Mer-Bear did it on his own, and got
a taste of the solo thing, and uh...

596
00:31:51,452 --> 00:31:54,205
- and kicked me to the curb.
- Oh, God.

597
00:31:54,288 --> 00:31:58,751
Chase, you win! I concede.
Just tell me how you did it.

598
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:05,007
Delivery guy came to your door
about a month ago, little za.

599
00:32:05,174 --> 00:32:06,175
Za?

600
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:08,219
Pizza, huh?

601
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:13,599
- Is this apartment d3375?
- Not even close.

602
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:19,188
Sleep!

603
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:22,858
Relaxing, floating,
drifting, dreaming...

604
00:32:23,526 --> 00:32:24,944
Falling.

605
00:32:25,027 --> 00:32:27,613
So, What he did,
my little womb-mate,

606
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:31,617
is he downloaded all
your private information,

607
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:34,870
and my employer
had all he needed.

608
00:32:34,954 --> 00:32:36,330
Thanks.

609
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:39,208
How did you know how to find him?

610
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:42,461
- That's a very good question, Atlas.
- Okay.

611
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:03,524
Just follow the guards.
They'll take you to my boss.

612
00:33:06,944 --> 00:33:10,698
Been fun playing this cat-and-mouse
with you, broski.

613
00:33:10,781 --> 00:33:12,616
Meow.

614
00:33:13,784 --> 00:33:16,745
Have fun at the Sands.

615
00:33:20,457 --> 00:33:23,377
- I am so, so, so sorry.
- Yeah, you should be.

616
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:26,630
Don't ever accuse me
of betraying us again, okay?

617
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:41,770
Do you guys ever think that
the Eye is watching this?

618
00:33:41,854 --> 00:33:44,315
You know, that maybe this
is even what they want?

619
00:33:46,442 --> 00:33:48,027
And at the exact right moment,

620
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:50,362
they're gonna swoop in,
and we'll be like,

621
00:33:50,446 --> 00:33:52,281
"Yes! Thank God you're here!

622
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:54,825
Thank God!
Just in the nick of time, Eye!"

623
00:33:54,909 --> 00:33:58,913
And then we'll just celebrate,
and it was all worth it in the end?

624
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:05,169
I don't even really
think that, either, so...

625
00:34:05,252 --> 00:34:06,545
It's cool.

626
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:28,275
So happy to be working with you.

627
00:34:28,359 --> 00:34:29,985
Please, come in. Come in.

628
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:33,673
Wait, sorry, how are you
working with us?

629
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:36,617
Oh, well, as much as a magician
who pulls a rabbit from a hat

630
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:39,536
is working with that rabbit.

631
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:43,165
We'll be working together. Yes.
Allow me to introduce myself.

632
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:45,751
Yeah, you're Walter Mabry.
You died a year ago.

633
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:47,711
Yes. An idea I got
from you, Mr. Wilder.

634
00:34:47,795 --> 00:34:49,713
Fake your death,
the world puts its guard down.

635
00:34:49,797 --> 00:34:51,799
I'm able to control
quite a few companies,

636
00:34:51,882 --> 00:34:53,384
including my old partner, Owen's,

637
00:34:53,467 --> 00:34:56,595
as a consortium of so-called
anonymous shareholders.

638
00:34:56,679 --> 00:35:00,391
- And that violates how many SEC laws?
- I believe it breaks all of them.

639
00:35:00,474 --> 00:35:01,850
All of them.

640
00:35:01,934 --> 00:35:04,812
You see, you all want an audience.

641
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:08,315
Need one, desperately.
It's quite sad, really.

642
00:35:08,399 --> 00:35:10,484
Hence, my ability to nab you.

643
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:13,362
I, on the other hand,
want the opposite of that.

644
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:17,825
I just want to be, and I am
100 percent off the grid.

645
00:35:17,908 --> 00:35:19,201
You know why?

646
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:21,787
Yeah, because the grid
is for actual human beings.

647
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:24,206
No, because in a world
of total surveillance,

648
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:27,418
the only true freedom
lies in not being seen.

649
00:35:27,501 --> 00:35:29,753
You can't control the grid
from within the grid.

650
00:35:29,837 --> 00:35:31,714
- Follow me.
- Yeah.

651
00:35:31,797 --> 00:35:33,590
- Follow me.
- Okay. All right.

652
00:35:33,674 --> 00:35:35,968
You pulled a hat out of a rabbit.
That was very colourful.

653
00:35:36,051 --> 00:35:39,555
Almost eight and a half years ago.
So, no need to bring that up.

654
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:42,266
We can't all be held accountable
for our adolescent personas.

655
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:44,476
Can we, Magicolio?

656
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,895
Magicolio, that was 15 years ago.

657
00:35:46,979 --> 00:35:48,856
Don't get me wrong, I love magic.

658
00:35:48,939 --> 00:35:50,139
Like you, and many others who,

659
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:53,235
I suppose, were not getting any sex
in high school, I dabbled with it.

660
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:58,699
But, unlike you, I was able to
transition upward towards actual magic.

661
00:35:58,782 --> 00:36:00,909
Science, you may
have heard it called.

662
00:36:03,454 --> 00:36:07,791
So, would you like to know,
my friends, just how I got you here?

663
00:36:07,875 --> 00:36:09,209
We know how you did it.

664
00:36:09,293 --> 00:36:10,294
No, you don't.

665
00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:13,097
Yeah, you stole our files for the show,
then obviously hypnotized us.

666
00:36:13,172 --> 00:36:14,590
Stop. No. Seriously, stop.

667
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:17,009
The strobe was a combo
of binaural beats, as well as...

668
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:19,428
I said stop!

669
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:22,014
You might not be having fun,
but I am.

670
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:25,225
You have an unusual way of showing it.

671
00:36:25,893 --> 00:36:26,894
So...

672
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:29,521
How did I do it?

673
00:36:29,605 --> 00:36:34,151
Easy. You see, magicians like to control
other people's perceptions.

674
00:36:34,234 --> 00:36:35,587
In your heightened state of agitation,

675
00:36:35,611 --> 00:36:37,946
<i>you saw the simplest cues.
Black tube, roof.</i>

676
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:40,449
<i>And your minds filled in the rest.</i>

677
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:43,368
<i>But the tube you meant to go down
was 20 feet to your right.</i>

678
00:36:43,452 --> 00:36:45,513
Go on, sit down. There's no one
standing in your way.

679
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:46,997
Don't mind if I do.

680
00:36:48,874 --> 00:36:51,043
Anyway, once in the tube,
yes, you're right...

681
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:54,922
<i>Blah, blah, blah, the strobe contained
UV letters pulsing the word "sleep."</i>

682
00:36:57,007 --> 00:37:00,803
<i>And that, combined with the sound,
put you into an instant alpha pattern.</i>

683
00:37:00,886 --> 00:37:03,680
<i>Sleep, sleep, sleep.</i>

684
00:37:03,764 --> 00:37:05,432
And from then on,
it really was just fun.

685
00:37:05,516 --> 00:37:08,560
And I can assure you,
you don't know what happened.

686
00:37:13,607 --> 00:37:16,610
That's really creepy.
Really, really creepy.

687
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:20,697
That's not cool.

688
00:37:20,781 --> 00:37:22,908
Yep, easy stuff, magic,

689
00:37:23,659 --> 00:37:25,035
if you put your mind to it.

690
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:27,119
All right, that's enough.
So why are we here, then?

691
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:29,873
Besides you getting to show off
how adorably clever you are.

692
00:37:29,957 --> 00:37:32,751
Well, to start with,
the man you stole from last year,

693
00:37:32,835 --> 00:37:35,635
turns out I had invested quite a lot
of money in some of his companies,

694
00:37:35,671 --> 00:37:38,882
so a lot of what you
stole was, in fact, mine.

695
00:37:38,966 --> 00:37:41,718
Good news is, it's very easy for you
to pay me back.

696
00:37:41,802 --> 00:37:44,513
I just need your skills.

697
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:47,474
Owen and I were like the Beatles,
if the Beatles had been...

698
00:37:47,558 --> 00:37:48,600
Elfin?

699
00:37:48,684 --> 00:37:50,018
Geniuses.

700
00:37:50,102 --> 00:37:51,728
Pretty sure the Beatles were geniuses.

701
00:37:51,812 --> 00:37:54,106
And like them, we had a dream.

702
00:37:54,982 --> 00:37:58,694
Could we create actual, genuine magic?

703
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:02,156
And I'm guessing one of you achieved
that dream, and it wasn't you?

704
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:05,367
That is what he
would like you to think.

705
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:10,539
My vision was a perfect blend
of elegance and technology.

706
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:12,958
But Owen wanted it for himself
so he humiliated me

707
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:16,211
by exposing my private files
to the board of directors

708
00:38:16,295 --> 00:38:17,772
and convinced them
that I am unstable.

709
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:19,965
Did you take a picture of him
while he was sleeping?

710
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:21,442
He had me kicked out of
my own company,

711
00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:23,844
and now he goes around
taking credit for a chip

712
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:25,679
that's not just the key to one computer,

713
00:38:25,762 --> 00:38:28,765
but every computer
system on the planet.

714
00:38:28,849 --> 00:38:31,935
It can un-encrypt anything,
crack the defence firewall,

715
00:38:32,019 --> 00:38:34,771
manipulate markets,
and spy on anyone.

716
00:38:34,855 --> 00:38:36,655
And now it's being sold
to the highest bidder.

717
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:38,376
If you're so rich,
why don't you just buy it?

718
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,818
So he gets the money?

719
00:38:39,902 --> 00:38:42,070
And the pleasure? No.

720
00:38:42,154 --> 00:38:45,407
No, no, no. Besides, why would I buy it
when I could have you steal it for me?

721
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:46,658
Oh!

722
00:38:46,742 --> 00:38:48,720
It's being previewed tomorrow
to the various suitors,

723
00:38:48,744 --> 00:38:52,414
which will include your targets,
a crew lead by a South African gangster.

724
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:53,957
South African gangster.

725
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:55,810
Yes. How your team
gets past security, that's up to you.

726
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:59,087
But once you do, you just need
to inspect it and steal it.

727
00:38:59,171 --> 00:39:00,172
That's it?

728
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:02,049
Come on, this is
perfect for you, isn't it?

729
00:39:02,132 --> 00:39:03,276
You're magicians and thieves.

730
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,886
What makes you think we would even
consider doing this?

731
00:39:05,969 --> 00:39:09,306
Oh, wait, I had a reason.
What was it? Oh, yes.

732
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:11,034
You see, back home,
you're wanted criminals.

733
00:39:11,058 --> 00:39:14,311
But here, I control the police,
the casinos, the media.

734
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:17,606
I can give you a new life,
out of hiding.

735
00:39:18,482 --> 00:39:21,068
And if you don't,
I'll have you killed.

736
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:25,739
You know What?
I'm not stealing a thing for you.

737
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:29,910
- Not unless Dylan tells me it's okay.
- Really? Dylan is where, exactly?

738
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:32,871
It doesn't matter. Yeah, I'm with him.
So you can go ahead and kill us

739
00:39:32,955 --> 00:39:34,995
because I'm not gonna
steal anything for you either.

740
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:38,627
Strikes me that a consensus
seems to be forming, Walter,

741
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,254
and we're calling your bluff.

742
00:39:41,964 --> 00:39:44,007
- Actually, we'll do it.
- What?

743
00:39:44,091 --> 00:39:46,843
We're in Macau. The oldest
magic store in the world is here.

744
00:39:46,927 --> 00:39:50,264
We'll get the supplies
we need, and we'll do it.

745
00:39:50,931 --> 00:39:52,808
Thank you.

746
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:54,351
It should be fun.

747
00:39:54,434 --> 00:39:57,437
Chase will take you
to the magic shop in the morning.

748
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:03,568
Badge.

749
00:40:07,114 --> 00:40:08,448
Really?

750
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:11,952
Thanks.

751
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:16,498
Agent Cowan. Your ID.

752
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:18,000
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

753
00:40:22,087 --> 00:40:24,548
It appears Mr. Bradley's
still at dinner.

754
00:40:24,631 --> 00:40:27,342
Yeah? Tell him recess is over.

755
00:40:35,267 --> 00:40:36,268
What?

756
00:40:54,453 --> 00:40:55,787
All right, so I made my move.

757
00:40:55,871 --> 00:40:58,040
Where are they?
I don't have time for bullshit.

758
00:40:58,123 --> 00:41:00,625
Oh, I have all the time
in the world, thanks to you.

759
00:41:00,709 --> 00:41:04,129
And I didn't get to finish my lobster,
which makes me very grumpy.

760
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:06,965
Okay, let's cut the crap.
What do you want?

761
00:41:07,049 --> 00:41:10,218
You can dispense with
the tough guy act to begin with.

762
00:41:10,302 --> 00:41:12,846
You're too desperate
for it to be believable.

763
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:17,559
I said, what do you want?

764
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:21,229
You used a form 219 warrant
to search my room.

765
00:41:21,313 --> 00:41:23,982
You found a connection
between me and the Four Horsemen.

766
00:41:24,066 --> 00:41:29,196
Which means you can take me
out of here on a 24-hour leave.

767
00:41:29,279 --> 00:41:33,492
- You want me to break you out?
- I want you to take me out.

768
00:41:33,575 --> 00:41:36,119
All you need is an extradition order,

769
00:41:36,203 --> 00:41:38,914
which you'll find in
that tray by my printer.

770
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:45,170
Dylan, I had nothing to do
with the Horsemen's disappearance.

771
00:41:45,253 --> 00:41:47,714
You were lured into a trap.

772
00:41:47,798 --> 00:41:50,842
And like Dorothy did
when she landed in Oz,

773
00:41:50,926 --> 00:41:57,140
you're beginning to realize
that the only way out is through.

774
00:41:57,224 --> 00:42:00,227
And I'm the only one
who can get you there.

775
00:42:01,144 --> 00:42:02,521
You got this place wired.

776
00:42:02,604 --> 00:42:06,733
You don't need me to get out of here.
This is all about payback.

777
00:42:06,817 --> 00:42:10,612
- I believe in an eye for an eye.
- So you're out to destroy me?

778
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:11,863
Oh, absolutely.

779
00:42:11,947 --> 00:42:13,257
You think I'm still gonna
play your little game?

780
00:42:13,281 --> 00:42:14,950
I know you will.

781
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:19,037
Because no matter how hard you try
to find a culprit behind all this,

782
00:42:19,121 --> 00:42:21,498
you're going to blame only yourself.

783
00:42:21,581 --> 00:42:26,044
When your little vendetta ended with you
putting me in jail 18 months ago,

784
00:42:26,128 --> 00:42:30,006
you got tired, you got sloppy.
You stopped paying attention.

785
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:32,134
And that's where you lost.

786
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:38,807
So, you can save yourself,

787
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:45,021
or you can make a deal with me,
and save the Four Horsemen,

788
00:42:45,105 --> 00:42:48,400
and stop wasting both of our time.

789
00:42:50,569 --> 00:42:55,991
Steal something for this narcissistic
little man boy? I don't like it.

790
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:58,201
But What I like less
is you deciding for us.

791
00:42:58,285 --> 00:43:00,888
Yeah? Do you like that we're the
laughing stocks of the magic world,

792
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:02,747
and the fugitives
of the actual world?

793
00:43:02,831 --> 00:43:04,541
Walter is right.
We have nowhere to go.

794
00:43:04,624 --> 00:43:05,876
But we can fix that.

795
00:43:05,959 --> 00:43:07,169
- We can fix it?
- Yeah.

796
00:43:07,252 --> 00:43:08,813
So you're officially
part of the team now?

797
00:43:08,837 --> 00:43:10,630
- Excuse me?
- I'm sure this is what Dylan

798
00:43:10,714 --> 00:43:12,859
meant when he said we should
all work as a single organism.

799
00:43:12,883 --> 00:43:16,136
Yeah, that is a fairytale
that Dylan tells himself, and tells us.

800
00:43:16,219 --> 00:43:18,847
Look, even if we get this stick,
he'll never let us go.

801
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:23,018
We can't trust Walter, okay?
The Eye has a history in Macau.

802
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:24,495
They're the only ones we can trust.

803
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:25,580
Now, if we can get it to them,

804
00:43:25,604 --> 00:43:27,898
they can clear our names
and get us the hell out of here.

805
00:43:27,981 --> 00:43:29,482
It's a bad plan, man.

806
00:43:37,157 --> 00:43:38,158
Hey.

807
00:43:39,159 --> 00:43:40,452
Hi, how are you?

808
00:43:40,535 --> 00:43:42,495
We need some things custom-made.

809
00:43:42,579 --> 00:43:44,223
Actually, by tomorrow.
We're kind of in a rush.

810
00:43:44,247 --> 00:43:45,916
And...

811
00:43:45,999 --> 00:43:48,210
You have no idea what
I'm talking about, do you?

812
00:43:54,174 --> 00:43:57,427
Welcome to long's.
My name's Li. Not Bruce Lee.

813
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:58,762
- What?
- Got you.

814
00:43:58,845 --> 00:43:59,888
- Okay.
- Look.

815
00:44:01,932 --> 00:44:02,933
Where'd it go?

816
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,354
Oh! And now it's by my head. How fun.

817
00:44:07,437 --> 00:44:08,980
- $20.
- $20?

818
00:44:09,064 --> 00:44:10,941
No, thank you.
We're kind of in a rush.

819
00:44:11,024 --> 00:44:13,276
- $10.
- No.

820
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,653
- Two for one.
- No.

821
00:44:14,736 --> 00:44:16,339
Okay, all right.
Just give us the thumbs. Yeah?

822
00:44:16,363 --> 00:44:18,615
Okay. Thanks a lot, Jack.
Please take these.

823
00:44:18,698 --> 00:44:21,326
So, we need a Keplinger holdout,

824
00:44:21,409 --> 00:44:25,413
and we also need roughing fluid,
a Sanada gimmick, sleeves, tracks.

825
00:44:25,497 --> 00:44:27,415
This is all in plastic,
though, if you can.

826
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:33,004
What?

827
00:44:35,257 --> 00:44:36,758
Is there a problem?

828
00:44:36,841 --> 00:44:40,011
My grandmother wants to know
why plastic? Plastic is cheap.

829
00:44:40,095 --> 00:44:42,347
Sorry. Yeah, we need plastic
because we're...

830
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:46,017
We're going through a very sensitive
metal detector, okay?

831
00:44:46,101 --> 00:44:48,812
So plastic, nothing. Metal...

832
00:44:50,939 --> 00:44:52,065
It detects.

833
00:44:57,487 --> 00:44:58,530
What did she say?

834
00:44:58,613 --> 00:45:01,950
She said just because you're
talking slowly and moving your hands

835
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:04,035
doesn't mean she can suddenly
understand English.

836
00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:06,871
Oh, yeah. So sorry. He's racist.

837
00:45:06,955 --> 00:45:11,167
Hey, bro. Listen, I know
that the only thing that we agree on

838
00:45:11,251 --> 00:45:13,837
is that our mom and dad
had one too many children.

839
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:18,216
So why don't we just let
the kids play with their toys

840
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:19,759
and go get a little drinkey-poo?

841
00:45:19,843 --> 00:45:25,181
- If it's free, it's me.
- Great. Guys, we'll be right back.

842
00:45:25,265 --> 00:45:28,893
Okay, kiddies,
the chaperones are watching you.

843
00:45:28,977 --> 00:45:31,229
Don't do anything I wouldn't enjoy.

844
00:45:32,314 --> 00:45:34,357
Okay. Have fun, you two.

845
00:45:36,735 --> 00:45:40,155
Hey. Can I use your phone?
It's kind of important.

846
00:45:40,238 --> 00:45:41,614
Sure.

847
00:45:42,449 --> 00:45:44,075
- On the house.
- Thanks.

848
00:45:45,744 --> 00:45:46,828
Who are you calling?

849
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:48,371
I'm arranging
to hand over the stick.

850
00:45:48,455 --> 00:45:50,206
So that's how we've been
contacting the Eye?

851
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:51,570
You've been doing it
on your own?

852
00:45:51,624 --> 00:45:52,751
Maybe.

853
00:45:52,834 --> 00:45:55,253
Oh, God.
Dylan's not gonna like this.

854
00:45:55,337 --> 00:45:57,417
I'm not really concerned
with what Dylan likes. Okay?

855
00:45:57,464 --> 00:45:58,715
I'm doing this for us.

856
00:46:00,884 --> 00:46:04,637
- What is wrong with this thing?
- Hey, relax, it's just a kid's toy.

857
00:46:04,721 --> 00:46:06,056
Yeah, that's what I thought.

858
00:46:06,139 --> 00:46:07,474
Okay. Let me just...

859
00:46:07,557 --> 00:46:09,934
Sorry, sorry. Jesus.

860
00:46:11,978 --> 00:46:14,397
Hey, can you get this?

861
00:46:18,985 --> 00:46:20,945
It's like birth, you know.

862
00:46:21,029 --> 00:46:24,491
One person enters the hospital,
two people come out.

863
00:46:24,574 --> 00:46:25,992
Walk and talk.

864
00:46:26,076 --> 00:46:28,411
I'll tell you on the plane.

865
00:46:28,495 --> 00:46:30,580
What plane?

866
00:46:30,663 --> 00:46:33,625
My sources tell me
your Horsemen are in Macau.

867
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:36,669
- What's the look?
- It's none of your business.

868
00:46:36,753 --> 00:46:37,962
Who are your sources?

869
00:46:40,632 --> 00:46:42,717
Just some old friends.

870
00:46:49,557 --> 00:46:52,644
When we have the card, where do I go?

871
00:46:52,727 --> 00:46:54,813
And 0 for 52.

872
00:46:55,105 --> 00:46:58,149
Well, it's perfect.
It's a perfect score.

873
00:46:59,234 --> 00:47:02,070
Then what about girls?

874
00:47:02,153 --> 00:47:03,988
Like, relationships?

875
00:47:04,072 --> 00:47:05,198
What?

876
00:47:09,077 --> 00:47:12,622
Look, it's not
something I'm proud of,

877
00:47:12,705 --> 00:47:18,753
but every girl I get close to,
I end up taking their trust.

878
00:47:18,837 --> 00:47:21,339
And then their wallet.

879
00:47:21,923 --> 00:47:23,049
So...

880
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:28,054
- You take their wallets?
- Yeah.

881
00:47:30,265 --> 00:47:32,392
You ever take their belts?

882
00:47:33,852 --> 00:47:38,273
Or how about some peanuts
from the hotel bar?

883
00:47:38,356 --> 00:47:41,317
Not sure why you took those.

884
00:47:41,401 --> 00:47:44,487
I'm sorry, did you think
that I was like those other girls?

885
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:47,824
Oh, Jack.

886
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:55,748
Okay. So there's a marketplace
down the street.

887
00:47:55,832 --> 00:47:57,959
And I'm meeting
a man with a blue hat.

888
00:47:58,042 --> 00:48:00,753
He'll get the stick to the right people
and get us home.

889
00:48:00,837 --> 00:48:02,881
You go grab Merritt, okay?
We got a lot to do.

890
00:48:02,964 --> 00:48:04,674
And, hey, put your belt on.

891
00:48:04,757 --> 00:48:07,427
Oh, no, it's not...
She took it off me and...

892
00:48:08,678 --> 00:48:11,514
You know, the most
heartbreaking moment of my life

893
00:48:11,598 --> 00:48:16,311
was when I discovered that you had
stolen all my money and split.

894
00:48:16,394 --> 00:48:18,480
I didn't realize until now

895
00:48:18,563 --> 00:48:21,024
how much of that money
you put into your face.

896
00:48:21,107 --> 00:48:25,695
Seriously, is it weird to have more hair
in your nose than on your head?

897
00:48:25,778 --> 00:48:28,323
Speaking of, next time
you get a hair transplant,

898
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:34,037
you might wanna consider requesting
something other than old man pubes.

899
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:38,166
You know What?
You are such a buffoon, Mer-Bear.

900
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:40,168
And this little ploy you have

901
00:48:40,251 --> 00:48:44,339
of stalling me while your friends
screw over my employer?

902
00:48:44,422 --> 00:48:46,049
Not gonna work.

903
00:48:48,426 --> 00:48:52,639
Chase! As you stare into my eyes,
you will find that you wanna sleep.

904
00:48:52,722 --> 00:48:55,350
When you wake, you will beg
for Merritt's forgiveness

905
00:48:55,433 --> 00:48:58,603
and realize that you will never be
half the man that he is.

906
00:49:00,647 --> 00:49:07,320
Merritt, I am so,
so very, very sorry

907
00:49:07,403 --> 00:49:10,114
about how pathetic your pupil is.

908
00:49:10,198 --> 00:49:13,368
Hey, a little hint
on your technique of surprise.

909
00:49:13,451 --> 00:49:17,747
It lacks that all-essential
little element of surprise.

910
00:49:18,289 --> 00:49:22,627
Hey, this has been fun, Mer-Bear.
Let's do it again sometime.

911
00:49:26,089 --> 00:49:31,010
Well, I've had ample time
to do some research, and you know,

912
00:49:31,094 --> 00:49:32,136
I was wrong.

913
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:35,807
I think the Eye
might actually be real.

914
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:37,350
Thought you didn't
buy into all that.

915
00:49:37,433 --> 00:49:39,435
I'd be lying if I
said I didn't think

916
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:42,855
that this road would lead to
the great wizard behind the curtain

917
00:49:42,939 --> 00:49:45,483
and, in the end,
I might get to see his face.

918
00:49:45,567 --> 00:49:46,776
That ain't gonna happen.

919
00:49:46,859 --> 00:49:48,462
Even if the fate of
the Horsemen depends on it?

920
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:51,215
Listen to me. I broke you out of there.
We're not changing the terms now.

921
00:49:51,239 --> 00:49:53,950
- You put me there!
- Yeah, because you deserve to be there.

922
00:49:54,033 --> 00:49:57,579
- Listen, I did not kill your father.
- What?

923
00:49:57,662 --> 00:50:00,582
All right, all right,
let's just cut the bullshit.

924
00:50:00,665 --> 00:50:04,252
I know who you are, Shrike.

925
00:50:05,587 --> 00:50:07,589
I know you blame me
for your father's death.

926
00:50:07,672 --> 00:50:11,634
I know you think I goaded him into
performing a trick he couldn't pull off.

927
00:50:11,718 --> 00:50:16,556
I know the time in jail was a result
of a 30-year revenge plot against me.

928
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:18,850
Supposing that's all true,
you think I'd tell you now?

929
00:50:18,933 --> 00:50:20,101
Man...

930
00:50:21,853 --> 00:50:23,479
Thirty years.

931
00:50:23,563 --> 00:50:29,152
Thirty years, and the greatest long game
magic trick ever created.

932
00:50:29,235 --> 00:50:33,031
Just to put me behind bars. Okay.

933
00:50:34,616 --> 00:50:36,492
So how did it feel, seeing me there?

934
00:50:37,535 --> 00:50:39,287
Was it all you hoped?

935
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:40,848
I don't know what you're talking about.

936
00:50:40,872 --> 00:50:44,959
You're lying.
It was an empty experience.

937
00:50:45,043 --> 00:50:47,086
And you wanna know how I know?

938
00:50:48,171 --> 00:50:50,882
I know because you know.

939
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:56,804
There's always, always more
than what's on the surface.

940
00:50:56,888 --> 00:50:59,325
So what, the past didn't happen,
and you're not who I think you are?

941
00:50:59,349 --> 00:51:00,534
Now, don't tell me in 30 years

942
00:51:00,558 --> 00:51:03,394
that's the first time you've
asked yourself that question.

943
00:51:04,062 --> 00:51:07,398
I am not my father.
You're not getting in my head, okay?

944
00:51:07,482 --> 00:51:09,984
You think you're luring me into a trap?
You're not.

945
00:51:10,068 --> 00:51:12,695
Now, I am desperate,
which means I'm dangerous.

946
00:51:12,779 --> 00:51:16,240
My only concern is the health
and well-being of the Horsemen.

947
00:51:16,324 --> 00:51:19,786
And you're gonna lead me to them.
And if you don't, I promise you,

948
00:51:19,869 --> 00:51:23,748
you're gonna end up far worse
than in some cushy jail cell somewhere.

949
00:51:37,178 --> 00:51:40,765
What if the Horsemen
don't actually need you to save them?

950
00:51:45,311 --> 00:51:48,106
All right. So the lab
is made up of two distinct layers,

951
00:51:48,189 --> 00:51:51,234
the security perimeter
and the clean room.

952
00:51:51,317 --> 00:51:53,319
The stick we're looking for
should be in this core.

953
00:51:53,403 --> 00:51:55,446
So we're gonna have to
get underneath, extract it,

954
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:57,240
and replace it with a decoy.

955
00:51:57,323 --> 00:51:58,717
Now, we're about to get to the chip.

956
00:51:58,741 --> 00:52:00,386
This is the thing
about the chip, it's very thin.

957
00:52:00,410 --> 00:52:03,287
Luckily, it's similar
in weight and size to a playing card,

958
00:52:03,371 --> 00:52:05,331
so we're gonna have to
brush up on our card-istry.

959
00:52:12,797 --> 00:52:13,965
That's no good.

960
00:52:23,474 --> 00:52:25,685
So how do we get in? Hannes Pike.

961
00:52:25,768 --> 00:52:27,562
He's the son of
a South African gangster.

962
00:52:27,645 --> 00:52:29,313
<i>He's RSVP'd with what looks like</i>

963
00:52:29,397 --> 00:52:31,357
<i>a couple of members
of his security detail.</i>

964
00:52:31,441 --> 00:52:34,444
<i>A doctor, to vet it, I guess,
and somebody named Buffy.</i>

965
00:52:34,527 --> 00:52:38,197
<i>Yeah, apparently, he travels
with a different bimbo every week. Hmm.</i>

966
00:52:38,281 --> 00:52:40,908
I wonder which one of us
gets to play the bimbo.

967
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,377
Hey, can I get in?

968
00:52:53,087 --> 00:52:54,630
At the soothing sound of the slots

969
00:52:54,714 --> 00:52:58,092
you slip into a serene state
of slumber and sleep.

970
00:52:59,594 --> 00:53:01,137
<i>Jack, for a moment,</i>

971
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:03,931
<i>they will think you're Hannes,
so lead them out and keep them busy.</i>

972
00:53:04,015 --> 00:53:06,184
You trust your people implicitly.

973
00:53:06,267 --> 00:53:08,311
You will have them
take care of everything,

974
00:53:08,394 --> 00:53:09,812
and you will wait in the car.

975
00:53:09,896 --> 00:53:13,441
And eyes open, wide awake. Go.

976
00:53:13,524 --> 00:53:15,318
Excuse me.
These people are following me.

977
00:53:15,401 --> 00:53:16,801
You might wanna
check their pockets.

978
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:23,034
<i>Then our time is
ticking to infiltrate the lab</i>

979
00:53:23,117 --> 00:53:25,262
<i>and get the card to the market,
where I'll hand it off to the Eye,</i>

980
00:53:25,286 --> 00:53:26,787
<i>so we can all get the hell home.</i>

981
00:53:45,848 --> 00:53:49,101
Hannes, my old friend.
So glad you could make it.

982
00:53:49,185 --> 00:53:52,271
I knew you had a soft spot
for an old-school bidding war.

983
00:53:52,355 --> 00:53:53,439
How have you been?

984
00:53:53,523 --> 00:53:57,151
I trust my people implicitly.
What they say goes.

985
00:53:57,235 --> 00:54:00,321
Certainly. But I'm sure
you'd like to see it for yourself.

986
00:54:00,404 --> 00:54:03,199
Hold it in your hands,
check the build quality.

987
00:54:05,618 --> 00:54:08,204
Or not. Also fine.

988
00:54:08,287 --> 00:54:10,289
Well, if you'd like to follow me.

989
00:54:13,793 --> 00:54:18,214
You'll have to remove all your metal.
Watches, rings, etc.

990
00:54:18,297 --> 00:54:20,633
- Yeah, of course.
- Excuse me for asking...

991
00:54:20,716 --> 00:54:22,552
Where might I have seen you before?

992
00:54:23,886 --> 00:54:26,305
I don't know, probably
one of my many symposiums.

993
00:54:26,389 --> 00:54:27,473
The book jacket!

994
00:54:27,557 --> 00:54:30,393
I have to say, Dr. Michaelakis,
I'm a huge fan.

995
00:54:30,476 --> 00:54:32,311
Oh, thank you so much.

996
00:54:32,395 --> 00:54:34,897
Which book?
There have been so many...

997
00:54:36,023 --> 00:54:38,776
Does Hannes' Chippy
always talk for you, Doctor?

998
00:54:40,611 --> 00:54:41,612
Doctor?

999
00:54:44,365 --> 00:54:48,077
Sorry, when you say "Chippy,"
you are referring to Buffy here, yeah?

1000
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,328
Of course.

1001
00:54:51,205 --> 00:54:55,626
Hannes prefers the term "floozy"
for all his boy toys.

1002
00:54:55,710 --> 00:54:58,754
- Yeah. He does. That's good.
- Noted.

1003
00:54:58,838 --> 00:55:00,881
By the way,
I got your email, Dr. Michaelakis.

1004
00:55:00,965 --> 00:55:02,466
You had a query about our ability

1005
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:04,635
to maintain quantum coherence
at room temperature

1006
00:55:04,719 --> 00:55:09,265
without the use of dilution,
refrigerators, or error correction.

1007
00:55:09,348 --> 00:55:10,975
Do you care to elucidate?

1008
00:55:11,058 --> 00:55:12,393
- Right.
- Yeah.

1009
00:55:12,476 --> 00:55:14,437
Yes, I did send that email.

1010
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:17,481
- The other day, I saw you.
- I did, I sent it. So what gives?

1011
00:55:17,565 --> 00:55:18,983
I'm sorry, what gives...

1012
00:55:19,066 --> 00:55:20,610
I think what she's trying to say...

1013
00:55:20,693 --> 00:55:22,713
Actually, the grown-ups
are having a meeting, Buffy.

1014
00:55:22,737 --> 00:55:23,988
Okay.

1015
00:55:24,071 --> 00:55:25,323
If you'll hold on to that.

1016
00:55:25,406 --> 00:55:27,116
- Yeah, sure, Doctor.
- Thank you.

1017
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:29,660
Now, every seventh grader,
even the dumb ones,

1018
00:55:29,744 --> 00:55:31,787
know the second law
of thermodynamics.

1019
00:55:31,871 --> 00:55:35,583
"All ordered systems
tend toward disorder." Disorder!

1020
00:55:35,666 --> 00:55:40,296
So I'm going to ask you one
more time, sir, what gives?

1021
00:55:45,968 --> 00:55:49,138
Well, it's actually
topological quantum order.

1022
00:55:49,221 --> 00:55:52,266
The emergence of quantum effects
on a macroscopic level.

1023
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:55,227
So that is, in fact, what gives.

1024
00:56:00,274 --> 00:56:01,359
Thank you.

1025
00:56:07,907 --> 00:56:11,952
You know,
Buffy is not a bad name for you.

1026
00:56:12,036 --> 00:56:15,623
You know, buff, firm, taut.

1027
00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:17,559
That's good.
Did you just find a thesaurus somewhere?

1028
00:56:17,583 --> 00:56:18,876
Nubile.

1029
00:56:18,959 --> 00:56:22,088
- That's good. Thank you. Okay.
- There we go.

1030
00:56:32,306 --> 00:56:34,100
Sorry, sorry.

1031
00:56:41,148 --> 00:56:43,401
The stick's metal.
How are we going to get it out?

1032
00:56:43,484 --> 00:56:44,694
Yeah. I don't know.

1033
00:56:45,903 --> 00:56:47,697
This is the housing.

1034
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:52,326
820 million qubit miles
of digi-synaptic resonance.

1035
00:56:57,707 --> 00:57:00,185
But of course, what sets us apart
from anything else on the planet

1036
00:57:00,209 --> 00:57:04,922
is the processor, which we playfully
refer to as the Magic Broomstick.

1037
00:57:05,005 --> 00:57:06,006
The Broomstick?

1038
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:09,802
Has the power to clear the contents
of any computing system on the planet

1039
00:57:09,885 --> 00:57:12,513
and then magically
sweep them into your bin.

1040
00:57:12,596 --> 00:57:15,224
Oh! Broomstick. That's funny.

1041
00:57:15,307 --> 00:57:18,060
Take a look, vet it however you'd like,

1042
00:57:18,144 --> 00:57:20,479
and tell Hannes we'll be
taking bids on Monday.

1043
00:57:20,563 --> 00:57:21,772
Thank you.

1044
00:57:23,858 --> 00:57:26,527
Oh, my God.
I must be allergic to something in here.

1045
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:28,529
What could you possibly be
allergic to in here?

1046
00:57:28,612 --> 00:57:31,782
- This room is hermetically sealed.
- That's it.

1047
00:57:31,866 --> 00:57:33,701
I'm allergic to hermetic seals.

1048
00:57:33,784 --> 00:57:35,554
If we could get him away
from the computer, please.

1049
00:57:35,578 --> 00:57:38,247
- That's the one thing.
- Just until he's recovered.

1050
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:39,874
We're gonna need some anti-bac...

1051
00:57:41,041 --> 00:57:42,793
Do we have alcohol wipes?

1052
00:57:42,877 --> 00:57:45,272
Your hands need to be sterile
if you intend to get any closer.

1053
00:57:45,296 --> 00:57:47,465
Do I make myself clear?

1054
00:57:49,175 --> 00:57:51,969
- Sorry. We couldn't...
- No, I'm fine.

1055
00:57:52,052 --> 00:57:53,321
Take his medicine into the country.

1056
00:57:53,345 --> 00:57:54,513
Yeah...

1057
00:57:57,933 --> 00:58:00,352
Can't risk any contamination.

1058
00:58:00,436 --> 00:58:03,189
You're gonna have to stay away
from the inner workings.

1059
00:58:03,272 --> 00:58:04,648
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

1060
00:58:04,732 --> 00:58:06,376
- All right. If you're done...
- Oh. Here you go.

1061
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,110
Sorry about this.
Okay. I'm okay.

1062
00:58:08,194 --> 00:58:10,321
This happens to him sometimes.
It'll pass.

1063
00:58:10,404 --> 00:58:12,281
Allergies. Nothing you can do.

1064
00:58:12,364 --> 00:58:14,366
Well, something you could do, Doctor.

1065
00:58:34,428 --> 00:58:35,721
Okay?

1066
00:58:42,478 --> 00:58:43,479
Search him, please.

1067
00:58:43,562 --> 00:58:44,980
Didn't we just do that?

1068
00:58:45,064 --> 00:58:46,398
Are you serious?

1069
00:58:46,482 --> 00:58:48,442
Okay. I wanna run
full diagnostics on the system.

1070
00:58:50,361 --> 00:58:52,238
This is completely unnecessary.

1071
00:59:21,809 --> 00:59:23,018
Up, up.

1072
00:59:23,102 --> 00:59:24,228
Okay.

1073
00:59:44,415 --> 00:59:46,792
Hey! I can walk on my own.

1074
00:59:57,636 --> 00:59:58,637
Sorry.

1075
01:00:16,405 --> 01:00:17,489
Hey!

1076
01:00:17,573 --> 01:00:19,450
I can do that myself.

1077
01:00:19,533 --> 01:00:21,785
We just met, man.

1078
01:00:21,869 --> 01:00:23,245
Handsy, handsy, handsy.

1079
01:00:35,466 --> 01:00:36,467
Hey!

1080
01:00:37,635 --> 01:00:40,137
My eyes are up here, man.

1081
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:41,639
How do you like it?

1082
01:01:04,203 --> 01:01:05,287
Hey, I'm good.

1083
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:07,998
Turn around.

1084
01:01:26,141 --> 01:01:27,393
Do you have anything?

1085
01:01:27,476 --> 01:01:29,144
I don't know.
Can't trust anybody.

1086
01:01:30,646 --> 01:01:32,898
- I'm good.
- They're clean.

1087
01:01:34,358 --> 01:01:36,276
Do your final checks
and get them out of here.

1088
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:38,696
Oh, we're walking
this way again. Yay.

1089
01:01:44,201 --> 01:01:47,788
I don't speak the language.

1090
01:01:54,211 --> 01:01:55,587
See?

1091
01:01:55,671 --> 01:01:57,631
What did I tell you, man?
We didn't have anything.

1092
01:01:58,549 --> 01:02:01,093
Thanks, pal. Appreciate that.

1093
01:02:17,026 --> 01:02:20,779
Something about a big white dance floor,
makes me wanna boogie.

1094
01:02:20,863 --> 01:02:23,115
Hey, thanks for having us.

1095
01:02:23,699 --> 01:02:25,617
That's great stuff.

1096
01:02:31,707 --> 01:02:32,958
Okay.

1097
01:02:33,042 --> 01:02:35,502
You guys are pretty serious
about your security, huh?

1098
01:02:38,964 --> 01:02:40,549
Okay.

1099
01:02:40,632 --> 01:02:44,094
Do I have all my things?
I feel like I came in with more stuff.

1100
01:02:44,178 --> 01:02:46,805
Did I come in with more stuff?

1101
01:02:46,889 --> 01:02:49,058
You don't think so?

1102
01:02:51,226 --> 01:02:53,771
Sir, I think you still have my wallet.

1103
01:02:53,854 --> 01:02:56,482
Remember, I, uh, gave it
to you when I came in?

1104
01:02:56,565 --> 01:02:58,734
It would be nice to leave with it.

1105
01:03:03,572 --> 01:03:04,573
Wallet coming through.

1106
01:03:12,456 --> 01:03:14,041
Sorry, my belt.

1107
01:03:21,381 --> 01:03:23,342
I guess that's everything, right?

1108
01:03:23,425 --> 01:03:24,510
Thank you.

1109
01:03:24,593 --> 01:03:27,137
- That is not a toy, Buffy.
- Sorry.

1110
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:33,936
Go, go, go!

1111
01:03:40,484 --> 01:03:42,319
All right.
Drop me off at the market

1112
01:03:42,402 --> 01:03:44,154
so I can get this to the Eye.

1113
01:03:44,238 --> 01:03:45,507
You asked me to call you
when they started

1114
01:03:45,531 --> 01:03:47,616
running around like headless chickens.

1115
01:03:48,659 --> 01:03:50,035
Well, that's what's happening.

1116
01:04:04,842 --> 01:04:07,469
This is where your sources
told you they'd be?

1117
01:04:07,553 --> 01:04:11,348
No, this is where my sources said
we might find an answer.

1118
01:04:22,526 --> 01:04:24,278
She must be familiar with your work.

1119
01:04:24,361 --> 01:04:25,779
Excuse me.

1120
01:04:25,863 --> 01:04:29,032
Miss, have you seen these people?

1121
01:04:39,751 --> 01:04:42,129
She says her grandson
spoke to their leader.

1122
01:04:42,212 --> 01:04:43,380
He's in the back.

1123
01:04:44,047 --> 01:04:45,257
What?

1124
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:47,217
No "Wow, you speak Mandarin"?

1125
01:05:18,874 --> 01:05:21,043
The Coffin to the Beyond.

1126
01:05:22,502 --> 01:05:27,049
It was always a flap,
or a trap or mirrors.

1127
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:31,678
The audience thought
he'd just disappeared.

1128
01:05:32,721 --> 01:05:35,641
{\an8}But he was always
hidden somewhere inside.

1129
01:05:47,319 --> 01:05:52,032
I believe that's the prototype
for the one your father had made.

1130
01:05:52,115 --> 01:05:55,452
He, like many others over the years,
ordered his supplies from here.

1131
01:05:57,621 --> 01:05:59,373
Of course.

1132
01:05:59,456 --> 01:06:03,168
That's why you gave me the look
when I said they were in Macau.

1133
01:06:03,251 --> 01:06:05,420
Your father used to come here
when you were young.

1134
01:06:05,504 --> 01:06:07,255
Can I please get some space here?

1135
01:06:12,469 --> 01:06:16,515
If you think you're the only one Who'd
wondered for 30 years what happened...

1136
01:06:16,974 --> 01:06:18,600
you're not.

1137
01:06:18,684 --> 01:06:21,019
Lionel was a master magician.

1138
01:06:21,103 --> 01:06:22,604
Either he gamed the hinges,

1139
01:06:22,688 --> 01:06:26,191
so he could kick the door
and they would pop out,

1140
01:06:26,274 --> 01:06:30,112
or he had access to the lock
from the inside so he could pick it.

1141
01:06:30,195 --> 01:06:34,866
Word is the safe was made
from cheap metal, and it bowed.

1142
01:06:34,950 --> 01:06:40,580
Still, he always had
something up his sleeve.

1143
01:06:40,664 --> 01:06:47,295
Unless he'd reached the limit of
his capabilities and his clock ran out.

1144
01:06:52,092 --> 01:06:56,596
Excuse me. My grandmother
has something you might want.

1145
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:02,602
This was your father's.

1146
01:07:02,686 --> 01:07:04,896
He had several of these made.

1147
01:07:24,291 --> 01:07:25,917
And the Horsemen?

1148
01:07:26,835 --> 01:07:28,962
I overheard them talking.

1149
01:07:29,046 --> 01:07:33,508
One of them, Atlas, he's meeting
someone at the market nearby.

1150
01:07:50,776 --> 01:07:52,360
As for former Agent Rhodes,

1151
01:07:52,444 --> 01:07:55,030
his location is now
your number one priority.

1152
01:07:55,113 --> 01:07:57,282
We're putting out an international APB.

1153
01:07:57,365 --> 01:08:00,118
We have Interpol, including cooperation
from local authorities.

1154
01:08:00,202 --> 01:08:01,453
Agent Cowan.

1155
01:08:01,536 --> 01:08:05,123
I'm assuming it was actually not you
who walked into Newburgh Federal Prison,

1156
01:08:05,207 --> 01:08:08,126
then walked out 30 minutes later
with Thaddeus Bradley?

1157
01:08:08,210 --> 01:08:10,128
- What?
- He used your ID.

1158
01:08:14,216 --> 01:08:16,176
What are you doing, Rhodes?

1159
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:45,664
- Atlas, hey.
- Dylan.

1160
01:08:45,747 --> 01:08:47,350
- I blew it, I'm sorry.
- What are you doing here?

1161
01:08:47,374 --> 01:08:48,583
I'm here to help now.

1162
01:08:48,667 --> 01:08:50,019
Okay, we definitely
don't need your help.

1163
01:08:50,043 --> 01:08:51,336
I know I messed up, all right?

1164
01:08:51,419 --> 01:08:52,980
Yeah, you put everybody's
lives in danger.

1165
01:08:53,004 --> 01:08:55,340
- Where is everybody?
- Where is everybody?

1166
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:57,151
I can't be seen with you,
actually, right now.

1167
01:08:57,175 --> 01:08:59,136
I got it now, okay?
I appreciate you taking

1168
01:08:59,219 --> 01:09:00,822
the time to take control
for a little while.

1169
01:09:00,846 --> 01:09:02,573
- Hey, I'm actually... Yeah?
- Yeah, but I got it now, all right?

1170
01:09:02,597 --> 01:09:03,640
- You do?
- Yeah.

1171
01:09:03,723 --> 01:09:05,118
You look like you can
get some rest, buddy.

1172
01:09:05,142 --> 01:09:07,644
- Who you meeting here?
- I'm not meeting anybody.

1173
01:09:07,727 --> 01:09:09,247
They told me at long's
you were meeting somebody.

1174
01:09:09,271 --> 01:09:11,189
At long's?

1175
01:09:11,273 --> 01:09:14,067
Okay, yeah, no, I am...

1176
01:09:14,151 --> 01:09:16,570
I'm meeting somebody from the Eye.

1177
01:09:16,653 --> 01:09:17,922
Yeah, no, they agreed to meet me

1178
01:09:17,946 --> 01:09:20,949
to exchange this computer chip
for our lives back.

1179
01:09:21,032 --> 01:09:22,312
So that's what it's come to now.

1180
01:09:22,367 --> 01:09:24,220
I hope you're happy
with the situation you've put us in.

1181
01:09:24,244 --> 01:09:25,745
You're talking to the Eye?

1182
01:09:25,829 --> 01:09:26,913
Yeah.

1183
01:09:26,997 --> 01:09:28,832
Why are you talking to the Eye?

1184
01:09:29,833 --> 01:09:32,794
Atlas.
Atlas, give me the stick.

1185
01:09:32,878 --> 01:09:35,172
Dylan, you're not our
leader anymore, okay?

1186
01:09:35,255 --> 01:09:37,883
You're not our hero.
You're not FBI.

1187
01:09:37,966 --> 01:09:40,927
You're not a magician.
You're not really anything.

1188
01:09:41,011 --> 01:09:43,847
And we trusted you for a year.

1189
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:46,308
So if you really wanna help us...
If you really...

1190
01:09:46,391 --> 01:09:49,019
If you really wanna help us,
you would leave.

1191
01:09:57,444 --> 01:10:00,739
I get it. Cool. Bye.

1192
01:10:18,381 --> 01:10:19,591
Hello, hello!

1193
01:10:19,674 --> 01:10:22,469
Yeah, that was me you called
at the magic shop.

1194
01:10:22,969 --> 01:10:25,931
So much fun though, knowing you'd be
scurrying away from me at the lab

1195
01:10:26,014 --> 01:10:27,432
just to bring it to me here.

1196
01:10:27,515 --> 01:10:29,142
Did you actually think I'd let you go?

1197
01:10:29,226 --> 01:10:31,937
- How did you do that?
- Everyone has their button.

1198
01:10:32,020 --> 01:10:35,982
You push it and they go blind.
And yours, obviously, is ego.

1199
01:10:36,066 --> 01:10:37,567
"Stay the course.

1200
01:10:37,651 --> 01:10:40,403
<i>Great changes are in store.</i>

1201
01:10:40,487 --> 01:10:42,989
<i>Trust that your unique talents</i>

1202
01:10:43,073 --> 01:10:44,658
will not go unrecognized."

1203
01:10:45,909 --> 01:10:47,369
- That was you.
- Yeah.

1204
01:10:47,452 --> 01:10:48,954
Merritt downloaded all the files,

1205
01:10:49,037 --> 01:10:51,748
but how do you think
we were able to find him?

1206
01:10:51,831 --> 01:10:52,916
Your phone.

1207
01:10:54,834 --> 01:10:56,795
I asked to see the face
behind all of this.

1208
01:10:56,878 --> 01:11:00,048
What you actually put your phone on
was a bi-wave siphon pad.

1209
01:11:01,549 --> 01:11:05,762
Once again, science beats magic.

1210
01:11:06,221 --> 01:11:08,515
- So, the stick?
- No.

1211
01:11:11,643 --> 01:11:12,644
I got it!

1212
01:11:12,727 --> 01:11:14,145
I got it. I got it.

1213
01:11:16,189 --> 01:11:18,066
- Fuck, Dylan!
- Wait, leave them!

1214
01:11:18,149 --> 01:11:19,669
You really think
I'm gonna walk away from you?

1215
01:11:19,693 --> 01:11:21,152
Give me the stick!

1216
01:11:21,861 --> 01:11:22,946
Give me it!

1217
01:11:23,029 --> 01:11:25,991
All right.
Don't ever question me again. Beat it!

1218
01:11:36,835 --> 01:11:39,337
- So, the stick.
- Go to hell.

1219
01:11:40,171 --> 01:11:41,172
Boys.

1220
01:11:53,643 --> 01:11:55,562
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1221
01:12:11,870 --> 01:12:13,288
There's like 10 of you.

1222
01:12:13,371 --> 01:12:15,165
Come on, he's just doing tricks.

1223
01:12:15,248 --> 01:12:17,125
He's there! Go!

1224
01:13:40,667 --> 01:13:45,463
Dylan, watch the pretty birdies fly.
And sleep.

1225
01:13:45,839 --> 01:13:49,134
- Doesn't work on me.
- Not even as a distraction?

1226
01:13:51,845 --> 01:13:54,431
- Good job.
- Nice to be involved.

1227
01:14:02,730 --> 01:14:04,774
Hey, guys! Guys! Hey!

1228
01:14:04,858 --> 01:14:07,545
- I just saw Dylan, something happened.
- What do you mean you just saw Dylan?

1229
01:14:07,569 --> 01:14:09,612
Dylan's here?
What happened?

1230
01:14:09,696 --> 01:14:12,157
- Atlas.
- I don't know.

1231
01:14:16,995 --> 01:14:18,163
What are they doing?

1232
01:14:18,246 --> 01:14:20,665
Those are Walter's men.

1233
01:14:20,874 --> 01:14:22,500
This is what they want.

1234
01:14:23,877 --> 01:14:26,087
What the hell?
How do you still have that?

1235
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:32,844
That's Lionel Shrike's safe.

1236
01:14:32,927 --> 01:14:35,430
What the hell
do they want with that?

1237
01:14:35,513 --> 01:14:37,265
Okay, we gotta
follow that truck.

1238
01:14:37,348 --> 01:14:40,685
They must have Dylan.
We don't have much time.

1239
01:14:45,064 --> 01:14:46,316
What do you want?

1240
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:51,029
You to understand something
very important.

1241
01:14:51,112 --> 01:14:54,365
We are mirror images.

1242
01:14:54,449 --> 01:14:55,742
You see, because like you,

1243
01:14:55,825 --> 01:14:58,077
I share a very deep connection
with my father.

1244
01:14:59,454 --> 01:15:04,417
And like you, I'll stop at nothing
to avenge any wrongs done to him.

1245
01:15:09,088 --> 01:15:12,634
You know the only difference
between your father and mine?

1246
01:15:12,717 --> 01:15:14,594
Mine's still alive.

1247
01:15:15,303 --> 01:15:16,513
Get him up.

1248
01:15:30,026 --> 01:15:34,364
So, this is the man

1249
01:15:34,447 --> 01:15:37,534
who spent a lifetime
plotting against me.

1250
01:15:39,536 --> 01:15:41,829
I wouldn't have known your face

1251
01:15:41,913 --> 01:15:45,416
if it had been on a billboard
outside my bedroom window.

1252
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:49,170
But you have spent, what,
30 years thinking about mine?

1253
01:15:49,254 --> 01:15:50,505
When my father died,

1254
01:15:50,588 --> 01:15:52,715
your insurance company
denied my mother her claims.

1255
01:15:52,799 --> 01:15:54,193
- I wouldn't even have known...
- She died a pauper!

1256
01:15:54,217 --> 01:15:56,052
Who your mother was.

1257
01:15:56,135 --> 01:16:00,723
She was a digit, a nano-byte
in a stream of data.

1258
01:16:00,807 --> 01:16:02,767
Because nothing is personal to you

1259
01:16:02,850 --> 01:16:05,162
and everyone and everything
is just a number, isn't that so?

1260
01:16:05,186 --> 01:16:07,814
That is where you are wrong,
Mr. Rhodes.

1261
01:16:07,897 --> 01:16:12,819
Once you made yourself known
it became very personal.

1262
01:16:14,070 --> 01:16:15,905
- My son...
- Yeah, the sociopath.

1263
01:16:15,989 --> 01:16:20,577
Funny thing is, I have seven
so-called legitimate children.

1264
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:23,663
Snivelling, snobbish, stupid runts.

1265
01:16:23,746 --> 01:16:27,709
I have one illegitimate child
who is a lot like me.

1266
01:16:27,792 --> 01:16:30,169
The point is,
he wants something,

1267
01:16:30,253 --> 01:16:35,383
and like any good parent, I will
stop at nothing to get it for him.

1268
01:16:35,466 --> 01:16:37,218
Your Horsemen have it.

1269
01:16:37,302 --> 01:16:41,598
You will turn it and them
over to us, now.

1270
01:16:41,681 --> 01:16:42,765
No.

1271
01:16:46,519 --> 01:16:49,272
Dylan, I would like you
to really take this moment in

1272
01:16:49,355 --> 01:16:52,775
because this is the consequence
of your personal vendetta come to life

1273
01:16:52,859 --> 01:16:54,611
and staring you in the face.

1274
01:16:54,694 --> 01:16:56,446
I want you to know
that when you're gone,

1275
01:16:56,529 --> 01:16:57,572
we're not going to stop.

1276
01:16:57,655 --> 01:16:59,741
We're gonna destroy
everything you believe in,

1277
01:16:59,824 --> 01:17:02,035
starting with the Horsemen,
and ending with the Eye.

1278
01:17:02,118 --> 01:17:03,995
Now then, cast your mind back

1279
01:17:04,078 --> 01:17:07,206
to standing by the banks of the river
watching your father descend,

1280
01:17:07,290 --> 01:17:09,292
disgraced and discredited.

1281
01:17:09,375 --> 01:17:12,128
The horrid psychic pain
as you have relived for years.

1282
01:17:12,879 --> 01:17:16,174
I felt that same thing two years ago

1283
01:17:16,257 --> 01:17:19,344
as you drained not just my father's
fortune, but his dignity!

1284
01:17:19,927 --> 01:17:21,929
And yet you took pleasure from it.

1285
01:17:24,766 --> 01:17:27,352
This should bring back
some childhood memories.

1286
01:17:54,754 --> 01:17:56,589
- Would you like some tea?
- Oh. Thank you.

1287
01:18:12,313 --> 01:18:14,607
- You ready?
- Over to you.

1288
01:18:21,614 --> 01:18:22,657
Splash!

1289
01:18:26,202 --> 01:18:27,578
Job done!

1290
01:18:43,219 --> 01:18:46,597
Hell is going to
seem like a day at the spa

1291
01:18:46,681 --> 01:18:49,142
by the time we're through
with these Horsemen.

1292
01:18:49,225 --> 01:18:51,894
- Wouldn't you say?
- You had me at "hell."

1293
01:19:08,786 --> 01:19:11,164
<i>I love you so much.</i>

1294
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:16,169
Always keep something up my sleeve.

1295
01:20:34,956 --> 01:20:38,000
I wish I could dredge
from the muck of my soul

1296
01:20:38,084 --> 01:20:42,171
one speck of remorse,
but I can't.

1297
01:20:42,255 --> 01:20:48,678
So I'll stick to the business at hand
and try not to smile too broadly.

1298
01:20:48,761 --> 01:20:54,100
And thank you for delivering
Mr. Dylan Rhodes.

1299
01:20:54,892 --> 01:20:56,602
I take it it's done.

1300
01:20:57,937 --> 01:20:59,897
Literally hit the bottom.

1301
01:21:00,481 --> 01:21:06,237
- Now, where are the Horsemen?
- They're performers.

1302
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:11,868
Their pride, their ego, their need
to be adored are all too powerful

1303
01:21:11,951 --> 01:21:13,828
to keep them out of
the limelight for long.

1304
01:21:13,911 --> 01:21:19,417
If they don't make themselves known,
you will find yourself

1305
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:23,462
in a very similar position
to Mr. Rhodes.

1306
01:21:23,546 --> 01:21:27,383
- Are we clear about that?
- As clear as the water he's under.

1307
01:21:34,891 --> 01:21:38,436
You'll have the rest
when I have the Horsemen.

1308
01:22:10,718 --> 01:22:11,761
Dylan!

1309
01:22:13,220 --> 01:22:15,556
Dylan, come on, buddy, breathe!

1310
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:16,849
- Dylan.
- Dylan?

1311
01:22:16,933 --> 01:22:19,018
Dylan, come on!

1312
01:22:23,272 --> 01:22:24,649
You're okay.

1313
01:22:26,067 --> 01:22:28,778
Jesus! You scared
the hell out of us, man.

1314
01:22:28,861 --> 01:22:32,490
- Are you all right, bro?
- Okay!

1315
01:22:32,573 --> 01:22:34,533
- Thank you!
- This is the least I could do.

1316
01:22:34,617 --> 01:22:36,595
No. There's a hell of a lot
less you could've done.

1317
01:22:36,619 --> 01:22:37,912
That was not an option.

1318
01:22:37,995 --> 01:22:39,872
You took a bullet for us, it was huge.

1319
01:22:39,956 --> 01:22:41,791
You really did, man.

1320
01:22:44,585 --> 01:22:46,295
Thanks for pulling me out.
Seriously.

1321
01:22:47,254 --> 01:22:48,589
Yeah.

1322
01:22:48,673 --> 01:22:50,800
You got yourself out.
We did the easy part.

1323
01:22:50,883 --> 01:22:53,135
Literally, in my case,
I was just standing on the shore

1324
01:22:53,219 --> 01:22:54,571
while Atlas jumped down and got you.

1325
01:22:54,595 --> 01:22:56,138
I'm serious.

1326
01:22:56,722 --> 01:22:58,599
Hey, you guys.
Something's not right.

1327
01:22:58,683 --> 01:23:00,393
- What's wrong?
- What?

1328
01:23:02,019 --> 01:23:04,313
- It's fake.
- What?

1329
01:23:06,065 --> 01:23:07,608
No, I had the stick.

1330
01:23:07,692 --> 01:23:10,319
The actual stick.
I swear, it was in my hand,

1331
01:23:10,403 --> 01:23:12,905
in the lab, and then I put it in
the little case thing.

1332
01:23:12,989 --> 01:23:15,175
- And I gave it to Atlas.
- Right, which I then gave to Dylan.

1333
01:23:15,199 --> 01:23:17,702
Is there any chance you've possibly
misplaced it at any point?

1334
01:23:17,785 --> 01:23:21,163
No, I took it from you
and then slipped it back in your coat

1335
01:23:21,247 --> 01:23:22,999
when I pushed you out.

1336
01:23:23,082 --> 01:23:26,293
Either way, we're left holding
a whole sack full of nada.

1337
01:23:26,377 --> 01:23:28,963
Yeah, but they're gonna come after us
as if we do have something.

1338
01:23:29,046 --> 01:23:32,383
No. Okay. I agree that somebody
got the better of us. Okay? Somehow.

1339
01:23:32,466 --> 01:23:34,885
But I don't agree
that we have a sack full of nada.

1340
01:23:34,969 --> 01:23:38,139
Because we're all here.
That's a sack full of something.

1341
01:23:39,140 --> 01:23:45,813
Listen, we all know that Walter is not
going to stop until he gets that chip.

1342
01:23:45,896 --> 01:23:49,442
And we're the only ones
that even know that he's alive.

1343
01:23:49,525 --> 01:23:54,113
We can't just walk away.
That's not what the Horsemen do.

1344
01:23:56,907 --> 01:23:58,701
There's a quote.

1345
01:23:58,784 --> 01:24:00,202
It's actually by the magician

1346
01:24:00,286 --> 01:24:02,086
that made me wanna do this
in the first place.

1347
01:24:02,121 --> 01:24:04,040
It's...

1348
01:24:04,123 --> 01:24:10,796
"A magician's greatest power lies
forever shrouded in his empty fist."

1349
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:13,215
"And the very idea
that he can convince the world

1350
01:24:13,299 --> 01:24:16,427
that he is, in fact,
carrying with him a secret."

1351
01:24:16,510 --> 01:24:19,346
- That's Lionel Shrike.
- Right.

1352
01:24:20,598 --> 01:24:21,682
So what are you saying?

1353
01:24:21,766 --> 01:24:24,977
That we should pretend like
we have something we don't?

1354
01:24:28,022 --> 01:24:31,442
- What is Walter's greatest fear?
- Being seen.

1355
01:24:31,525 --> 01:24:35,529
- And what does the stick do?
- The stick can unencode anything.

1356
01:24:35,613 --> 01:24:40,534
It can open up a back door
into any computer on the planet.

1357
01:24:40,618 --> 01:24:42,620
- Including his.
- Yeah.

1358
01:24:44,246 --> 01:24:46,665
Right, we not only make him
think that we have it,

1359
01:24:46,749 --> 01:24:50,836
but that we're going to use it
to expose and destroy him.

1360
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:54,298
We need a plan.
But we don't have time.

1361
01:24:54,381 --> 01:24:57,843
We have each other
and there are five of us.

1362
01:24:57,927 --> 01:25:00,846
But we also need supplies, right?
And resources.

1363
01:25:00,930 --> 01:25:04,183
And probably more than five people.

1364
01:25:04,266 --> 01:25:08,145
Do you really think
you don't have help?

1365
01:25:08,229 --> 01:25:10,981
Oh, she speaks English.
Of course. Yeah.

1366
01:25:11,065 --> 01:25:16,487
Do you know why the Fool is
the most powerful card in the tarot?

1367
01:25:16,570 --> 01:25:20,199
Not because the person
who draws him is a fool.

1368
01:25:20,282 --> 01:25:24,703
He's a fool because he's a clean slate,

1369
01:25:24,787 --> 01:25:28,707
and, therefore, can become anything.

1370
01:25:28,791 --> 01:25:30,084
You were chosen.

1371
01:25:30,876 --> 01:25:32,670
All of you.

1372
01:25:32,753 --> 01:25:37,967
Not because of who you are,
but because of who you might become.

1373
01:25:39,593 --> 01:25:43,430
When you say "chosen"...
Are you part of the Eye?

1374
01:25:43,514 --> 01:25:47,560
Yes. We are part of the Eye.

1375
01:25:47,643 --> 01:25:50,855
You've each doubted our existence.

1376
01:25:51,689 --> 01:25:55,985
Wondering if we,
indeed, were watching.

1377
01:25:59,613 --> 01:26:03,242
We are.
We always have been.

1378
01:26:03,325 --> 01:26:05,828
This is the best
magic shop in the world.

1379
01:26:05,911 --> 01:26:08,122
- You know what she's saying, right?
- Yes.

1380
01:26:08,205 --> 01:26:10,583
That now we have
resources and help.

1381
01:26:12,418 --> 01:26:13,752
Thank you.

1382
01:26:16,255 --> 01:26:17,923
So, who's in?

1383
01:26:21,719 --> 01:26:24,305
- I'm in.
- Yeah, I'm in.

1384
01:26:27,141 --> 01:26:28,142
Let's do this.

1385
01:26:45,868 --> 01:26:47,578
No, no, no.

1386
01:26:50,206 --> 01:26:52,333
<i>Not long ago, we were tricked.</i>

1387
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:55,336
<i>I was exposed
and brought back from the dead.</i>

1388
01:26:55,419 --> 01:26:58,255
<i>So we thought it was only fitting
that we do the same thing</i>

1389
01:26:58,339 --> 01:27:02,676
<i>- to the person who did it to us.
- Midnight, New Year's Eve. London.</i>

1390
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:06,013
<i>We will be performing a series of shows
that all connect to our big finale,</i>

1391
01:27:06,096 --> 01:27:08,224
<i>so pay close attention to each trick.</i>

1392
01:27:08,307 --> 01:27:09,391
Get my father.

1393
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:12,645
Run!

1394
01:27:12,728 --> 01:27:15,898
I want Interpol, Scotland Yard,
whoever we have in London.

1395
01:27:15,981 --> 01:27:17,233
What do we know about Rhodes?

1396
01:27:17,316 --> 01:27:19,151
Wherever the Horsemen are,
that's where he is.

1397
01:27:19,235 --> 01:27:20,361
Let's get to the airport.

1398
01:27:20,444 --> 01:27:22,844
<i>So leave your kiddies
at home and get ready for a wild night,</i>

1399
01:27:23,614 --> 01:27:25,908
<i>because we, too, will bring
someone back from the dead.</i>

1400
01:27:26,075 --> 01:27:27,868
Let's move, everyone!

1401
01:27:27,952 --> 01:27:29,828
<i>In front of
the largest stage in the world...</i>

1402
01:27:29,912 --> 01:27:31,830
<i>The actual world.</i>

1403
01:27:31,914 --> 01:27:35,668
You know they're playing you, right?
Leading you into a trap?

1404
01:27:35,751 --> 01:27:37,419
Yeah, but the threat is real.

1405
01:27:37,503 --> 01:27:40,172
This card can hack into any system
on the planet, including ours.

1406
01:27:40,256 --> 01:27:42,466
They have it, why wouldn't
they use it to expose us?

1407
01:27:42,549 --> 01:27:44,051
Me. Everything we've done.

1408
01:27:44,134 --> 01:27:46,178
Is it real, Mr. McKinney?

1409
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:54,812
The threat is real.

1410
01:27:54,895 --> 01:27:57,147
So, how do we stay
ahead of them?

1411
01:27:57,231 --> 01:27:59,608
We need to get
to London by midnight.

1412
01:28:08,325 --> 01:28:09,827
<i>We are here in London</i>

1413
01:28:09,910 --> 01:28:12,413
<i>on this New Year's Eve,
and the crowds are out in force.</i>

1414
01:28:12,496 --> 01:28:13,956
<i>Locals and tourists alike</i>

1415
01:28:14,039 --> 01:28:16,166
<i>getting ready for
the party of the year.</i>

1416
01:28:16,250 --> 01:28:18,168
<i>A video gone viral from the infamous</i>

1417
01:28:18,252 --> 01:28:20,087
<i>Horsemen magicians has surfaced.</i>

1418
01:28:20,170 --> 01:28:21,839
<i>They promise
to make a grand reappearance.</i>

1419
01:28:21,922 --> 01:28:25,009
<i>But Will it end in
their arrest on national television ?</i>

1420
01:28:25,092 --> 01:28:26,760
<i>Or some sort of vindication?</i>

1421
01:28:26,844 --> 01:28:28,929
<i>Who knows where they'll show up...</i>

1422
01:28:29,013 --> 01:28:30,180
{\an8}<i>But we do know, wherever,</i>

1423
01:28:31,348 --> 01:28:33,600
{\an8}<i>whenever that is,
people will be watching.</i>

1424
01:28:35,311 --> 01:28:37,229
Yeah, texts, tweets, Instagrams.

1425
01:28:37,313 --> 01:28:40,274
Anything that says "Horsemen,"
brags about seeing the Horsemen,

1426
01:28:40,357 --> 01:28:42,026
tag them and bundle them.

1427
01:28:42,109 --> 01:28:44,486
Dad, who do we have security-wise
on this? Your guys?

1428
01:28:44,570 --> 01:28:45,738
Whoever you want.

1429
01:28:45,821 --> 01:28:47,701
Well, we want all of them
and all their friends.

1430
01:28:47,781 --> 01:28:49,884
Anyone who wants to work
stationed throughout the city,

1431
01:28:49,908 --> 01:28:51,702
so they can be anywhere in 60 seconds.

1432
01:29:06,008 --> 01:29:08,802
Hello! Hey!

1433
01:29:10,220 --> 01:29:12,014
My name's Jack Wilder.

1434
01:29:12,848 --> 01:29:14,808
Goddamn, it feels good to be back.

1435
01:29:16,393 --> 01:29:18,479
All right, gather around. Indulge me.

1436
01:29:18,562 --> 01:29:20,773
I wanna talk to you about
something real quick.

1437
01:29:20,856 --> 01:29:24,735
You all know Three Card Monte,
also known as "Find the Lady"?

1438
01:29:24,818 --> 01:29:29,114
Trick performed by street hustlers all
over the world. And why street hustlers?

1439
01:29:29,198 --> 01:29:32,076
Because as soon as you walk up
to the table, you lose.

1440
01:29:32,159 --> 01:29:34,119
Every time.
Let me demonstrate.

1441
01:29:36,580 --> 01:29:40,709
While we're at it,
let's find ourselves a life-sized Queen.

1442
01:29:40,793 --> 01:29:42,711
Ma'am, would you
mind being my Queen?

1443
01:29:46,048 --> 01:29:48,384
Don't worry. I promise you
there's a 50 percent chance

1444
01:29:48,467 --> 01:29:49,819
you'll get her back after the show.

1445
01:29:49,843 --> 01:29:51,637
Head over there.
Thank you very much.

1446
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:55,224
All right. Let's find ourselves
some Jacks to serve our Queen!

1447
01:29:55,307 --> 01:29:56,600
<i>Trust me, gentlemen.</i>

1448
01:29:56,683 --> 01:30:00,437
I know how these guys work now.
They're gonna start with a tease.

1449
01:30:00,521 --> 01:30:02,481
A few little pop-ups.

1450
01:30:02,564 --> 01:30:05,442
<i>Something to lure you in. Like...</i>

1451
01:30:05,526 --> 01:30:09,655
Well, you know, like Three Card Monte,
where the guy goes,

1452
01:30:09,738 --> 01:30:12,282
"Looky here, but no, no, looky here!"

1453
01:30:12,366 --> 01:30:16,286
<i>Except when all these
little tricks are done,</i>

1454
01:30:16,370 --> 01:30:18,455
<i>the only thing
you're gonna be looking at</i>

1455
01:30:18,539 --> 01:30:22,501
is the inside of your own colon,
with the words

1456
01:30:22,584 --> 01:30:25,504
<i>"Horsemen“ written all over it.</i>

1457
01:30:26,255 --> 01:30:27,798
In blood.

1458
01:30:27,881 --> 01:30:31,343
We get the picture, Mr. McKinney.

1459
01:30:31,427 --> 01:30:33,470
And get out of my chair.

1460
01:30:33,554 --> 01:30:35,764
Hello, everybody!

1461
01:30:35,848 --> 01:30:37,808
Come close, come on!

1462
01:30:37,891 --> 01:30:39,810
All right, all right, so listen.

1463
01:30:39,893 --> 01:30:45,357
Tonight, I am going to make
something fly using actual magic.

1464
01:30:45,441 --> 01:30:47,192
- Are you ready?
- Yeah!

1465
01:30:47,276 --> 01:30:50,320
I'm going to take
a very large vessel,

1466
01:30:50,404 --> 01:30:54,741
I'm gonna make it fly over there
and land on the Thames.

1467
01:30:54,825 --> 01:30:56,660
Can you handle that?

1468
01:30:56,743 --> 01:30:58,287
Same rules apply as before.

1469
01:30:58,370 --> 01:31:00,456
All you need to do is
keep your eye on the Queen.

1470
01:31:00,539 --> 01:31:01,874
It's as simple as that.

1471
01:31:01,957 --> 01:31:03,667
- Are you guys ready?
- Yeah!

1472
01:31:03,750 --> 01:31:05,210
Dad, look at this.

1473
01:31:06,545 --> 01:31:07,939
Tag this one.
Where does it come from?

1474
01:31:07,963 --> 01:31:10,090
Near the river.
Looks like the shows are starting.

1475
01:31:10,174 --> 01:31:11,734
But we're not the only ones
who found them.

1476
01:31:11,758 --> 01:31:13,398
- What do you mean?
- It's on Channel One.

1477
01:31:21,643 --> 01:31:22,853
- Let's go to 2.
- Here we go.

1478
01:31:22,936 --> 01:31:25,522
Got him. We have a location.

1479
01:31:25,606 --> 01:31:27,566
It's Jack Wilder.
Here come the Horsemen.

1480
01:31:27,649 --> 01:31:29,610
Okay, we're moving.
Let's go, let's go.

1481
01:31:29,693 --> 01:31:31,403
Typing in grid coordinates now.

1482
01:31:33,197 --> 01:31:35,824
Turn around.
Hide yourselves with the cards.

1483
01:31:36,492 --> 01:31:39,661
And here we go. Switch!

1484
01:31:41,163 --> 01:31:43,349
You guys still have your eye on her?
You want me to go back and do it?

1485
01:31:43,373 --> 01:31:46,460
Okay, all right. I'm moving on.
And switch.

1486
01:31:48,420 --> 01:31:49,463
Where is she?

1487
01:31:50,839 --> 01:31:52,883
Down at the end?
You sure?

1488
01:31:52,966 --> 01:31:55,761
All right, can I get a drum-roll
from my man in the back?

1489
01:31:55,844 --> 01:31:57,763
Thank you very much.

1490
01:32:03,685 --> 01:32:05,771
There's my girl.

1491
01:32:06,230 --> 01:32:08,857
Not my girl, 100 percent your girl.

1492
01:32:08,941 --> 01:32:10,275
But just in this situation.

1493
01:32:10,359 --> 01:32:12,986
Okay, but I gotta warm up
a little bit first. Okay?

1494
01:32:13,070 --> 01:32:16,949
So, let me just
make something small fly, like...

1495
01:32:17,032 --> 01:32:19,159
Fly, fly, fly!

1496
01:32:19,243 --> 01:32:22,621
Wow, right? Look at that!
Come on, people.

1497
01:32:22,746 --> 01:32:25,624
Tough crowd. You, fly!

1498
01:32:25,707 --> 01:32:26,833
- Me?
- Check your fly.

1499
01:32:30,379 --> 01:32:31,964
You like that?

1500
01:32:32,047 --> 01:32:33,924
You support that relationship?

1501
01:32:34,007 --> 01:32:36,885
That guy had a bird in his pants.
That's disgusting.

1502
01:32:40,556 --> 01:32:42,599
<i>Copy that.
We've got two sightings reported.</i>

1503
01:32:42,683 --> 01:32:45,602
<i>- Heading to Greenwich Market.
- Get me Thaddeus.</i>

1504
01:32:45,686 --> 01:32:47,980
<i>Thaddeus, the FBI are here.
They're moving.</i>

1505
01:32:48,063 --> 01:32:51,149
Let 'em move.
That's what the Horsemen want.

1506
01:32:51,233 --> 01:32:52,961
Well, What if they get there first?
That can't happen.

1507
01:32:52,985 --> 01:32:55,112
<i>I guarantee you, they won't.</i>

1508
01:32:55,195 --> 01:32:56,405
Find the pattern.

1509
01:32:57,364 --> 01:33:00,325
You do that, and you'll be able
to cut them off

1510
01:33:00,409 --> 01:33:02,786
<i>before they get to their final trick.</i>

1511
01:33:02,869 --> 01:33:06,582
If it makes you feel better,
I'll take care of the FBI.

1512
01:33:19,886 --> 01:33:22,306
OK, well, I guess you found me!

1513
01:33:22,389 --> 01:33:23,974
We've got a third spot.

1514
01:33:24,057 --> 01:33:26,560
Okay, everybody,
we're getting a pattern.

1515
01:33:29,980 --> 01:33:33,984
Give me two, 13 and 21.

1516
01:33:35,068 --> 01:33:37,946
What the hell is that?
Freeze that and zoom in.

1517
01:33:40,073 --> 01:33:42,826
How the hell did this happen?

1518
01:33:42,951 --> 01:33:46,079
He's dead. We watched him drown.
How the hell did this happen?

1519
01:33:46,163 --> 01:33:48,665
Given that it did happen,
the pertinent question is,

1520
01:33:48,749 --> 01:33:49,809
what are we gonna do about it?

1521
01:33:49,833 --> 01:33:51,585
We're gonna stop him, Dad.
We'll stop him.

1522
01:33:51,668 --> 01:33:52,753
Where's my coat?

1523
01:33:52,836 --> 01:33:55,547
Walter, for the record,
I never loved the safe idea.

1524
01:33:55,631 --> 01:33:57,174
Oh, I know where they're going.

1525
01:33:57,257 --> 01:33:59,843
The next show is Merritt's
and it's by the river.

1526
01:33:59,926 --> 01:34:01,303
Chase, you need to get to him

1527
01:34:01,386 --> 01:34:03,626
so we can find the Horsemen's
entry point for the finale.

1528
01:34:09,227 --> 01:34:12,898
I have a confession to make. I've been
told I have some control issues.

1529
01:34:12,981 --> 01:34:16,318
I've learned that it's really,
really hard to control people,

1530
01:34:16,401 --> 01:34:20,322
so I'm gonna try to control something
that's a lot easier than people.

1531
01:34:20,405 --> 01:34:21,841
I'm gonna try to
control the weather.

1532
01:34:21,865 --> 01:34:23,742
Yeah, rain...

1533
01:34:26,161 --> 01:34:27,847
It'd be a little difficult
to make it rain, right?

1534
01:34:27,871 --> 01:34:30,624
That would be something
that only God can do, right?

1535
01:34:30,707 --> 01:34:33,001
I'm gonna do something
that God can't do.

1536
01:34:33,085 --> 01:34:35,962
I'm not just gonna make it clear up.
No, no, no.

1537
01:34:36,046 --> 01:34:38,131
I'm gonna make it actually stop.

1538
01:34:51,436 --> 01:34:54,648
And can God do that?
No, I don't think so.

1539
01:34:54,731 --> 01:34:57,067
Or what about make it go up?

1540
01:35:04,741 --> 01:35:06,743
Are you still with me?

1541
01:35:06,827 --> 01:35:09,871
Watch the Queen on the left.
Let's do it. Turn around.

1542
01:35:13,250 --> 01:35:14,376
Switch!

1543
01:35:18,088 --> 01:35:19,256
Show me the lady.

1544
01:35:19,339 --> 01:35:22,134
Show me the lady!

1545
01:35:22,217 --> 01:35:23,385
The end? End?

1546
01:35:25,887 --> 01:35:28,047
You know What?
I'm actually starting to feel kinda bad.

1547
01:35:29,015 --> 01:35:32,102
It's just because I can actually feel
that you guys are paying attention.

1548
01:35:32,185 --> 01:35:33,812
It's just that...

1549
01:35:33,895 --> 01:35:37,315
You know, it's unfortunate
that it's the wrong kind of attention.

1550
01:35:38,567 --> 01:35:41,027
Yeah, we need a fresher bird.

1551
01:35:42,237 --> 01:35:45,323
He's so cute. He's so cute!

1552
01:35:45,407 --> 01:35:47,117
Let's kill him, right?

1553
01:35:48,243 --> 01:35:52,205
- Merritt, move into position.
- Got it, Dylan.

1554
01:35:52,289 --> 01:35:53,957
I'm on my way.
I'll see you there.

1555
01:35:54,040 --> 01:35:56,418
Lula, stand by, all right?

1556
01:35:56,501 --> 01:35:58,837
Or, what about just go,
I don't know, just go insane?

1557
01:36:08,388 --> 01:36:10,849
<i>Reports are coming in
from all over London</i>

1558
01:36:10,932 --> 01:36:14,519
<i>as the Horsemen appear to have taken
over the whole city for their show.</i>

1559
01:36:17,564 --> 01:36:21,234
Hey, broski-whaddya-knowski?
Where you headed?

1560
01:36:21,318 --> 01:36:22,670
- Please, bro, don't do this.
- Where are you headed?

1561
01:36:22,694 --> 01:36:24,488
North, south, east?

1562
01:36:25,363 --> 01:36:26,865
East. Tower of London?

1563
01:36:26,948 --> 01:36:29,701
Tower Bridge?
Near Tower Bridge? The Thames!

1564
01:36:29,785 --> 01:36:34,331
You're going to the Thamesy-Whemsy!
You're so easy!

1565
01:36:34,414 --> 01:36:37,042
Bro, if there's any chance of us
ever having a relationship...

1566
01:36:37,125 --> 01:36:39,503
There's not.
Where's your entry?

1567
01:36:39,586 --> 01:36:43,381
South Bank? Greenwich? Greenwich.

1568
01:36:43,465 --> 01:36:47,093
I know where you're going.
I know where...

1569
01:36:48,428 --> 01:36:49,805
Watch it, hobo.

1570
01:36:52,724 --> 01:36:55,227
Hey, Merritt. Oh, come on.
Tell me you're kidding. How?

1571
01:36:57,020 --> 01:36:58,396
When?

1572
01:36:58,480 --> 01:37:01,107
Shit. All right. All right, I got it.

1573
01:37:01,191 --> 01:37:03,235
Don't worry about it.
I'll warn the others.

1574
01:37:06,196 --> 01:37:07,864
Sorry. Just...

1575
01:37:10,534 --> 01:37:11,618
What? I just told you...

1576
01:37:11,701 --> 01:37:12,702
Phone call.

1577
01:37:14,120 --> 01:37:15,205
- Hello?
- <i>Lula.</i>

1578
01:37:15,288 --> 01:37:18,625
Dylan. Yeah, kind of in the middle
of something right now.

1579
01:37:18,708 --> 01:37:21,294
<i>Wrap it up.
Meet me at the rendezvous point now.</i>

1580
01:37:21,378 --> 01:37:22,629
- What?
- <i>Now!</i>

1581
01:37:23,338 --> 01:37:25,298
Was that an act of God?

1582
01:37:25,382 --> 01:37:28,468
No. No, no, no,
that was an act of me

1583
01:37:28,552 --> 01:37:31,721
and the strobe lights
and rain machines.

1584
01:37:31,805 --> 01:37:33,723
And I hope you guys
were paying attention.

1585
01:37:33,807 --> 01:37:36,167
Because you're gonna need to know
all of that for the final.

1586
01:37:39,563 --> 01:37:42,649
So how did I do it?
Did I use a Barry Trap?

1587
01:37:42,732 --> 01:37:45,026
Maybe some switches
or a few duplicates?

1588
01:37:45,110 --> 01:37:46,152
<i>Jack, go now!</i>

1589
01:37:46,236 --> 01:37:47,338
You know What?
I hate to say it.

1590
01:37:47,362 --> 01:37:49,162
You're gonna have to wait to find out.
I know.

1591
01:37:49,197 --> 01:37:51,616
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I love you all.

1592
01:37:55,036 --> 01:37:56,121
<i>Lula, go!</i>

1593
01:37:56,204 --> 01:37:58,290
I have to go.

1594
01:38:17,142 --> 01:38:21,354
Out of the way, FBI!
Move, move, move! Go!

1595
01:38:21,438 --> 01:38:23,148
Get some men in that park!

1596
01:38:23,231 --> 01:38:24,357
Men in the park, now!

1597
01:38:24,441 --> 01:38:26,568
You gonna fill up on appetizers?

1598
01:38:26,651 --> 01:38:29,279
Or save room for
the main course?

1599
01:38:29,362 --> 01:38:31,156
Where the hell are the Horsemen?

1600
01:38:31,239 --> 01:38:32,519
You can chase them all you want,

1601
01:38:32,574 --> 01:38:35,035
you're just gonna wind up
holding your own tails.

1602
01:38:36,036 --> 01:38:38,830
Or, you can let them
come to you.

1603
01:38:38,914 --> 01:38:40,498
So, what's it gonna be?

1604
01:38:40,582 --> 01:38:41,708
Chase them?

1605
01:38:42,709 --> 01:38:44,085
Or make a deal with me?

1606
01:38:50,550 --> 01:38:52,344
Again? How did we
get found out again?

1607
01:38:52,427 --> 01:38:54,238
It's fine, it's fine.
We'll just cut to the finale.

1608
01:38:54,262 --> 01:38:55,822
- Where's Merritt?
- Fine. I don't know.

1609
01:38:55,847 --> 01:38:56,848
I'm here.

1610
01:38:56,932 --> 01:38:58,725
- Where's Lula?
- I'm right here!

1611
01:38:58,808 --> 01:39:00,685
What the hell happened?

1612
01:39:00,769 --> 01:39:02,705
- My goddamn brother happened.
- Don't worry about it.

1613
01:39:02,729 --> 01:39:04,209
We just gotta get to the destination.

1614
01:39:04,272 --> 01:39:06,250
- Lula, can you handle that thing?
- I can ride it.

1615
01:39:06,274 --> 01:39:08,276
Have you asked the guys
that question, or just me?

1616
01:39:08,360 --> 01:39:09,611
- Yeah, good point.
- Let's go!

1617
01:39:09,694 --> 01:39:10,779
No, Jack.

1618
01:39:15,450 --> 01:39:16,451
Shit!

1619
01:39:19,412 --> 01:39:20,830
Jack's down. We gotta get him.

1620
01:39:24,209 --> 01:39:25,251
Come on, move!

1621
01:39:30,715 --> 01:39:32,968
- Jack! Go, go!
- That's the brake.

1622
01:39:33,051 --> 01:39:34,636
That's the gas.
You'll figure it out.

1623
01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:36,388
Come on, follow me!

1624
01:39:37,681 --> 01:39:38,682
That's it?

1625
01:39:55,323 --> 01:39:56,908
- Hey, ready?
- Yeah!

1626
01:40:03,748 --> 01:40:05,083
Get on.

1627
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:11,047
- Yeah!
- Okay, guys, I'm coming!

1628
01:40:12,132 --> 01:40:13,425
Jesus!

1629
01:40:14,884 --> 01:40:16,636
I'm coming!

1630
01:40:24,769 --> 01:40:26,604
- Get up! Come on!
- Okay.

1631
01:40:27,981 --> 01:40:29,190
You got me.

1632
01:40:29,274 --> 01:40:31,443
Those things are really dangerous!

1633
01:40:33,194 --> 01:40:35,405
- Come on!
- Go!

1634
01:40:37,198 --> 01:40:39,367
Get him in! Move it!

1635
01:40:43,788 --> 01:40:45,457
What is happening?

1636
01:40:45,540 --> 01:40:47,792
Where are they?

1637
01:40:47,876 --> 01:40:49,878
They should be
arriving any second.

1638
01:40:51,171 --> 01:40:53,590
That is, if they're gonna
get here by midnight.

1639
01:41:05,894 --> 01:41:08,271
Okay, feeling fear.

1640
01:41:08,646 --> 01:41:11,316
Fear. Anger, anger.

1641
01:41:12,025 --> 01:41:15,028
- Oh, full house!
- That's enough.

1642
01:41:16,654 --> 01:41:18,031
I was done.

1643
01:41:18,990 --> 01:41:23,078
So nice to see you all again.

1644
01:41:23,161 --> 01:41:28,666
But since we're such old friends,
let's skip the formalities.

1645
01:41:29,667 --> 01:41:34,422
One of you
has something we require.

1646
01:41:36,091 --> 01:41:37,717
So give it over.

1647
01:41:45,934 --> 01:41:48,186
Nothing at all?

1648
01:41:49,437 --> 01:41:50,605
Really?

1649
01:41:53,691 --> 01:41:55,068
Sit down!

1650
01:42:02,283 --> 01:42:03,701
Let's go, let's go!

1651
01:42:04,953 --> 01:42:06,287
Let's go, let's go!

1652
01:42:06,371 --> 01:42:08,957
Hurry up and move them quickly
before they can do anything.

1653
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:10,208
Get those lights off me!

1654
01:42:16,005 --> 01:42:17,549
Get on the plane!

1655
01:42:20,510 --> 01:42:21,761
Hey!

1656
01:42:24,389 --> 01:42:25,390
Get on the plane!

1657
01:42:35,024 --> 01:42:36,276
- Hey!
- Hey!

1658
01:42:36,359 --> 01:42:38,236
Yeah, take off immediately.

1659
01:42:41,656 --> 01:42:44,284
You know, you make it almost too easy?

1660
01:42:44,367 --> 01:42:48,037
I mean, even your hilarious attempts
to make yourselves unpredictable,

1661
01:42:48,121 --> 01:42:49,956
just follow the same pattern each time.

1662
01:42:50,039 --> 01:42:52,041
Set up, set up, set up.

1663
01:42:52,125 --> 01:42:53,376
Big reveal.

1664
01:42:53,459 --> 01:42:55,837
Which tonight was going
to be stroke of midnight,

1665
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:58,631
middle of the Thames?
Tell me if I'm warm.

1666
01:43:03,553 --> 01:43:07,348
Well, there will be a big reveal,
and it will come now.

1667
01:43:09,100 --> 01:43:12,187
The stick, dear boy.

1668
01:43:12,770 --> 01:43:14,022
- Fine.

1669
01:43:14,606 --> 01:43:16,816
Start with her.

1670
01:43:18,026 --> 01:43:19,194
Hey, hey, hey!

1671
01:43:21,404 --> 01:43:24,782
- Give it to him.
- Danny, give him the card.

1672
01:43:24,866 --> 01:43:26,701
- Just give it to him.
- Danny, come on.

1673
01:43:36,753 --> 01:43:37,879
We'll have a closer look.

1674
01:43:46,346 --> 01:43:48,306
Okay, I owe you an apology.

1675
01:43:48,389 --> 01:43:50,683
Leader, you should have
planned an escape, okay?

1676
01:43:50,767 --> 01:43:52,411
- This is the both of us.
- Okay, it's the both of us.

1677
01:43:52,435 --> 01:43:53,937
- Guys, come on!
- Come on, stop!

1678
01:43:54,020 --> 01:43:56,814
- You, to save your little girlfriend!
- To save my...

1679
01:43:56,898 --> 01:43:59,150
- He had a knife to her head!
- I'm a Horseman, you dick!

1680
01:43:59,234 --> 01:44:00,753
All right, you know what?
This is not the time!

1681
01:44:00,777 --> 01:44:02,195
And you, what's your deal, man?

1682
01:44:02,278 --> 01:44:04,405
Look, they're not gonna get blood
all over the seats.

1683
01:44:04,489 --> 01:44:06,175
They're probably gonna
throw us out of the plane.

1684
01:44:06,199 --> 01:44:07,551
- Really?
- I'm sorry to interrupt,

1685
01:44:07,575 --> 01:44:09,661
but I just have to
say congratulations.

1686
01:44:09,744 --> 01:44:10,954
And thank you!

1687
01:44:12,538 --> 01:44:13,748
It's real.

1688
01:44:13,831 --> 01:44:15,250
What?

1689
01:44:15,333 --> 01:44:16,834
It's real?

1690
01:44:18,544 --> 01:44:19,587
Bring them through.

1691
01:44:19,671 --> 01:44:20,755
Did you say it's real?

1692
01:44:20,838 --> 01:44:21,839
What is he talking about?

1693
01:44:21,923 --> 01:44:23,132
Move!

1694
01:44:23,216 --> 01:44:24,717
Well done, my boy.

1695
01:44:28,596 --> 01:44:31,015
Cote Du Marisule champagne.

1696
01:44:31,099 --> 01:44:35,186
It's the most expensive bottle on Earth.

1697
01:44:36,104 --> 01:44:38,231
$1.2 million.

1698
01:44:38,314 --> 01:44:42,318
And I saved it just for this occasion.

1699
01:44:42,402 --> 01:44:46,656
Honestly, same bottle,
Liquor Shack, 700K.

1700
01:44:46,739 --> 01:44:49,826
Hey. You got what you wanted.

1701
01:44:49,909 --> 01:44:52,453
So, does this mean
you're letting us go?

1702
01:44:52,537 --> 01:44:55,456
Knowing what you
know about us? No.

1703
01:44:55,540 --> 01:44:59,210
- You sure?
- Chase, what shall we do?

1704
01:45:01,004 --> 01:45:03,172
Toss them out.

1705
01:45:03,256 --> 01:45:05,800
Get your last words
in quickly, everybody!

1706
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:11,180
- No! Come on! No!
- Farewell.

1707
01:45:11,556 --> 01:45:13,766
Oh, God! No!

1708
01:45:15,059 --> 01:45:17,437
Wait! I just wanna say...

1709
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:19,772
I came into the world
with the wrong family,

1710
01:45:19,856 --> 01:45:21,816
but I'm leaving with the right one.

1711
01:45:21,899 --> 01:45:23,443
I love you guys!

1712
01:45:23,526 --> 01:45:24,569
- No!
- No, no, no!

1713
01:45:26,404 --> 01:45:28,823
This is how I kicked
you out of the womb.

1714
01:45:28,906 --> 01:45:29,991
No!

1715
01:45:31,534 --> 01:45:32,869
Who's next?

1716
01:45:39,042 --> 01:45:40,877
No, wait! Let me go!

1717
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:43,296
Let go of me!

1718
01:45:43,379 --> 01:45:45,673
No, no, no!

1719
01:45:45,757 --> 01:45:47,425
- Let me go!
- Toss her!

1720
01:45:50,887 --> 01:45:52,764
Oh, God!

1721
01:45:52,847 --> 01:45:55,850
Hurry up and shut that door!
It's getting cold in here.

1722
01:45:55,933 --> 01:45:57,852
Okay, hit the road, Jack!

1723
01:46:03,483 --> 01:46:04,609
No, no, no!

1724
01:46:06,027 --> 01:46:08,279
A lot of brain,
but not enough brawn.

1725
01:46:12,075 --> 01:46:13,076
Oh, that was fun!

1726
01:46:15,953 --> 01:46:18,956
Cheers! Well done, my boy.

1727
01:46:24,879 --> 01:46:27,048
No, is it supposed to taste like that?

1728
01:46:27,173 --> 01:46:28,633
No, it is not.

1729
01:46:48,486 --> 01:46:50,029
What the hell is going on?

1730
01:47:00,039 --> 01:47:02,291
Okay, come pick them up!

1731
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:04,710
- Come on.
- Come on out.

1732
01:47:18,015 --> 01:47:21,853
<i>Ladies and gentlemen... The Horsemen!</i>

1733
01:47:42,206 --> 01:47:44,459
<i>No, you should feel pretty
good about yourself, man.</i>

1734
01:47:44,542 --> 01:47:48,087
<i>You predicted it correctly.
The Thames, stroke of midnight.</i>

1735
01:47:48,171 --> 01:47:49,964
<i>New Year's Eve. Happy New Year!</i>

1736
01:47:57,013 --> 01:47:58,264
Unbelievable!

1737
01:47:58,347 --> 01:47:59,741
- We are moving now.
- The whole thing just changed.

1738
01:47:59,765 --> 01:48:02,518
- All backup into position stat!
- We're on the move.

1739
01:48:04,020 --> 01:48:06,230
- You're staying here!
- Of course.

1740
01:48:13,613 --> 01:48:15,448
Move! Move! Out of the way!

1741
01:48:15,531 --> 01:48:17,742
Wow! Thank you very much, London!

1742
01:48:17,825 --> 01:48:22,121
We would like to acknowledge not just
our old friend, Arthur Tressler.

1743
01:48:22,205 --> 01:48:24,749
But his young and very
brilliant son, Walter Mabry.

1744
01:48:24,832 --> 01:48:27,251
Who has performed one of the
greatest feats of illusion

1745
01:48:27,335 --> 01:48:28,961
even we have ever seen.

1746
01:48:29,045 --> 01:48:33,257
He has, amazingly, brought
himself back from the dead!

1747
01:48:34,217 --> 01:48:37,386
But before he did that,
he revealed someone.

1748
01:48:37,470 --> 01:48:42,600
And we think it only right
to give him a proper introduction.

1749
01:48:42,683 --> 01:48:46,687
He is our friend and he is our leader.
Dylan Shrike!

1750
01:48:46,771 --> 01:48:48,773
- Get over here!
- Yeah!

1751
01:48:54,654 --> 01:49:01,494
So, normally only the magician, his
assistant, and a few trusted stage hands

1752
01:49:01,577 --> 01:49:03,788
know the secret of a trick.

1753
01:49:03,871 --> 01:49:06,874
But tonight, however, in this effect,

1754
01:49:06,958 --> 01:49:10,044
all of you people
around the Thames here.

1755
01:49:10,127 --> 01:49:14,757
And since we're streaming live,
everyone around the world

1756
01:49:14,840 --> 01:49:17,343
already knows everything.

1757
01:49:17,426 --> 01:49:21,514
And only these fellows
here are the ones left in the dark.

1758
01:49:21,597 --> 01:49:24,517
So let's see how closely
you were watching our shows.

1759
01:49:24,600 --> 01:49:28,312
Remember when we were playing
"Find the Lady," and I said

1760
01:49:28,396 --> 01:49:30,314
<i>that we used a Barry Trap.</i>

1761
01:49:31,107 --> 01:49:34,694
<i>Some classic switches
and a few duplicates?</i>

1762
01:49:34,777 --> 01:49:38,281
<i>Well, that's how we switched
the driver of the truck.</i>

1763
01:49:41,367 --> 01:49:43,619
<i>Which took us to a duplicate hangar</i>

1764
01:49:43,703 --> 01:49:46,247
<i>where we used your need to rush,</i>

1765
01:49:46,330 --> 01:49:49,333
<i>and your fear of being seen
let you do the work for us.</i>

1766
01:49:49,417 --> 01:49:51,210
Get those lights off me!

1767
01:49:52,503 --> 01:49:56,757
So, the airplane.
How did we get it to fly?

1768
01:49:57,842 --> 01:50:02,638
<i>Well, we used fans,
and lights and rain machines.</i>

1769
01:50:07,893 --> 01:50:12,523
Obviously, all of this was
reliant on us getting caught.

1770
01:50:12,607 --> 01:50:13,899
But we needed to make sure

1771
01:50:13,983 --> 01:50:16,068
that you would do exactly
what we needed you to do

1772
01:50:16,152 --> 01:50:17,653
once you did catch us.

1773
01:50:17,737 --> 01:50:23,784
My brother Chase, who was
technical adviser to the losing team.

1774
01:50:23,868 --> 01:50:26,537
He taught us that it's
all about blind spots.

1775
01:50:26,621 --> 01:50:28,289
I know where you're going!

1776
01:50:28,372 --> 01:50:31,834
And... surprises.

1777
01:50:33,669 --> 01:50:35,212
Watch it, hobo.

1778
01:50:35,296 --> 01:50:36,964
Why don't you watch
the watch I'm wearing,

1779
01:50:37,048 --> 01:50:39,675
the where of where
you're watching, and sleep!

1780
01:50:39,759 --> 01:50:43,095
It's going to be your idea to throw
the Horsemen out of the plane.

1781
01:50:43,179 --> 01:50:45,640
If all of this is
kind of confusing to you,

1782
01:50:45,723 --> 01:50:47,683
I can maybe catch you up on it later.

1783
01:50:47,767 --> 01:50:50,186
Probably see you what, three to five?

1784
01:50:51,354 --> 01:50:55,733
Come on, put it there.
Hey! Tit for tat, bro!

1785
01:50:56,275 --> 01:50:59,236
Basically, we showed them everything.

1786
01:50:59,320 --> 01:51:04,617
How you kidnapped us to steal the very
thing that is in your pocket right now.

1787
01:51:06,827 --> 01:51:08,204
Whoops!

1788
01:51:11,832 --> 01:51:14,293
You know, this thing here,

1789
01:51:14,377 --> 01:51:17,838
which you said you could
use to adjust markets,

1790
01:51:17,922 --> 01:51:21,592
manipulate governments,
and spy on whomever you choose.

1791
01:51:21,676 --> 01:51:23,511
Also, you could, as you said,

1792
01:51:23,594 --> 01:51:26,764
control the public
from outside the grid.

1793
01:51:27,682 --> 01:51:32,978
These men destroy people's lives.

1794
01:51:33,062 --> 01:51:37,108
Spying on the world, robbing you
of your right to privacy.

1795
01:51:37,191 --> 01:51:40,444
And they do that
by hiding in the dark.

1796
01:51:40,528 --> 01:51:45,074
So, in the Horsemen tradition,
we're here to expose them.

1797
01:51:45,157 --> 01:51:50,204
Tonight, they, like all of us,

1798
01:51:50,287 --> 01:51:53,457
are finally stepping into the light.

1799
01:51:57,420 --> 01:51:58,587
Thank you, everybody!

1800
01:51:58,671 --> 01:52:01,298
We are the Horsemen
and we will be back very soon!

1801
01:52:03,592 --> 01:52:07,596
Five, four, three, two, one!

1802
01:52:24,447 --> 01:52:27,032
- Hey, we're on the clock.
- Get a move on.

1803
01:52:30,119 --> 01:52:31,245
There they are!

1804
01:52:31,328 --> 01:52:33,372
- There's more inside.
- Don't you bloody touch me!

1805
01:52:33,456 --> 01:52:35,124
The Horsemen are over on the...

1806
01:52:37,918 --> 01:52:39,378
Oh, Shit!

1807
01:52:40,045 --> 01:52:41,839
Stay with them!

1808
01:52:41,922 --> 01:52:43,924
Everybody spread out!

1809
01:52:44,008 --> 01:52:45,843
Nobody leaves this barge!

1810
01:52:47,762 --> 01:52:50,848
Rhodes, hold it right there!
Do not move!

1811
01:52:56,520 --> 01:52:58,189
This contains everything.

1812
01:52:58,272 --> 01:53:01,358
Not just Walter and Tressler,
but all their dealings.

1813
01:53:01,442 --> 01:53:04,445
All their contacts,
the entire network.

1814
01:53:04,528 --> 01:53:06,739
And why on Earth
would I believe you?

1815
01:53:06,822 --> 01:53:10,493
I told you.
I'm the same man I've always been.

1816
01:53:10,576 --> 01:53:13,037
Move it! Come on!
Let's go, go, go!

1817
01:53:13,120 --> 01:53:15,915
I'm not part of this
organization! I'm Merritt.

1818
01:53:15,998 --> 01:53:19,210
I'm a patsy!
I'm a patsy!

1819
01:53:20,127 --> 01:53:22,004
Ten minutes.

1820
01:53:23,798 --> 01:53:25,841
Now you're playing
the long game.

1821
01:53:39,730 --> 01:53:41,941
Dad, I promise you I will fix this.

1822
01:53:42,024 --> 01:53:44,401
You can't. Stop calling me dad.

1823
01:53:44,485 --> 01:53:48,405
There were so many women,
I have no idea whose bastard you are.

1824
01:53:48,489 --> 01:53:49,615
What?

1825
01:53:49,698 --> 01:53:52,034
- What happened?
- Thin air, gone. Come with me.

1826
01:53:52,117 --> 01:53:55,746
What're you talking about, gone?
People don't just disappear.

1827
01:53:55,830 --> 01:53:58,541
You realize that he doesn't actually
have magical powers!

1828
01:54:38,247 --> 01:54:39,665
- Hey, guys.
- Hey!

1829
01:54:39,748 --> 01:54:42,167
- Good to see you all.
- Good to see you, Li.

1830
01:54:43,294 --> 01:54:44,420
Come on in.

1831
01:54:47,673 --> 01:54:50,509
Good morning. Welcome.

1832
01:54:52,970 --> 01:54:56,515
I'm proud of you.
All of you.

1833
01:54:56,599 --> 01:55:00,102
I have a lot to show you. Come.

1834
01:55:01,353 --> 01:55:02,605
Come.

1835
01:55:13,949 --> 01:55:15,159
Dad.

1836
01:55:32,593 --> 01:55:34,219
Yes.

1837
01:55:34,303 --> 01:55:37,056
Your father and I were partners.

1838
01:55:37,139 --> 01:55:40,267
Our act was that of rivals.

1839
01:55:41,477 --> 01:55:47,107
I was the hard-eyed realist.
He was the dreamy-eyed idealist.

1840
01:55:47,191 --> 01:55:49,902
We thought it was the perfect misdirect.

1841
01:55:50,986 --> 01:55:54,657
Yes, in public, I did goad him.

1842
01:55:54,740 --> 01:55:59,578
The only thing we didn't count on
was it going so wrong.

1843
01:56:03,582 --> 01:56:05,417
Why?

1844
01:56:05,501 --> 01:56:07,252
Why didn't you ever say anything to me?

1845
01:56:07,336 --> 01:56:08,837
I don't know.

1846
01:56:10,005 --> 01:56:11,298
Give it a name.

1847
01:56:11,382 --> 01:56:14,802
Shame, guilt. Regret.

1848
01:56:18,555 --> 01:56:21,517
Hey, guys, you might
wanna come take a look at this.

1849
01:56:25,729 --> 01:56:26,939
Look.

1850
01:56:27,022 --> 01:56:28,816
<i>I put you in jail, man.</i>

1851
01:56:28,899 --> 01:56:31,235
Why didn't you
say something then?

1852
01:56:31,318 --> 01:56:34,321
Well, you know, I was going to.

1853
01:56:34,405 --> 01:56:39,034
But then, you were so quick to show
your personal motivations that...

1854
01:56:40,327 --> 01:56:43,706
Well, quite frankly
it spoiled the trick for me.

1855
01:56:43,789 --> 01:56:45,082
I showed my weakness.

1856
01:56:45,165 --> 01:56:47,960
Well, it showed you weren't ready.

1857
01:56:48,043 --> 01:56:50,671
But when you came back to my cell,

1858
01:56:50,754 --> 01:56:55,175
you had let go of your
30-year vendetta against me...

1859
01:56:56,176 --> 01:56:57,636
for your Horsemen.

1860
01:56:59,221 --> 01:57:03,934
<i>And I said to myself,
"That's Lionel's boy.“</i>

1861
01:57:04,810 --> 01:57:08,188
<i>And I knew it was my job to see to it</i>

1862
01:57:08,272 --> 01:57:11,984
<i>that he became the magician
he was born to be.</i>

1863
01:57:12,067 --> 01:57:14,403
All that was left then was...

1864
01:57:16,155 --> 01:57:17,489
For me to hit bottom.

1865
01:57:18,282 --> 01:57:23,120
So the safe, my father's wristwatch,
that was all you?

1866
01:57:25,914 --> 01:57:29,251
<i>Walter and Tressler,
were they in on it too?</i>

1867
01:57:29,334 --> 01:57:32,171
<i>Oh, we knew
Walter was in hiding.</i>

1868
01:57:32,254 --> 01:57:35,966
<i>The Octa show was a setup
to expose him to the public.</i>

1869
01:57:39,011 --> 01:57:41,138
<i>And you were right
about the Horsemen.</i>

1870
01:57:41,221 --> 01:57:46,268
<i>They needed to learn to work together
like a single organism.</i>

1871
01:57:53,942 --> 01:57:56,570
Now I know Why
you look so familiar.

1872
01:57:56,653 --> 01:57:58,238
You're the Horsemen, aren't you?

1873
01:58:05,954 --> 01:58:07,372
Okay.

1874
01:58:07,456 --> 01:58:09,500
<i>But that can't be
what all this is about.</i>

1875
01:58:09,583 --> 01:58:14,088
You know, the best tricks
work on many levels.

1876
01:58:14,171 --> 01:58:18,133
And the deepest one,
for me, at least,

1877
01:58:18,217 --> 01:58:21,011
is this moment right here.

1878
01:58:24,640 --> 01:58:26,141
I'm sorry, Dylan.

1879
01:58:26,809 --> 01:58:29,311
I miss your father.

1880
01:58:29,394 --> 01:58:32,898
Thirty years is a long time to drag
something around, isn't it?

1881
01:58:32,981 --> 01:58:34,650
Yes, it is.

1882
01:58:44,618 --> 01:58:45,869
So, now what?

1883
01:58:48,330 --> 01:58:51,208
- Now I'm about out of moves.
- Oh...

1884
01:58:51,291 --> 01:58:52,626
And I'm tired.

1885
01:58:52,709 --> 01:58:55,105
Come on, you're the one who said
that you believe that this road

1886
01:58:55,129 --> 01:58:57,089
led to the great wizard
behind the curtain.

1887
01:58:57,172 --> 01:58:58,215
I did.

1888
01:58:58,298 --> 01:59:00,425
And that you'd finally
get to look him in the eyes.

1889
01:59:01,844 --> 01:59:03,512
I am.

1890
01:59:09,309 --> 01:59:11,770
It's your game now.

1891
01:59:11,854 --> 01:59:14,439
You play it however you see fit.

1892
01:59:15,691 --> 01:59:21,530
My suggestion, however, is that
you find yourself a successor.

1893
01:59:21,613 --> 01:59:23,490
Hi. Okay, so...

1894
01:59:23,574 --> 01:59:26,869
Well, obviously,
we have a few questions. Right?

1895
01:59:26,952 --> 01:59:29,454
Uh... By "a few,"
I think he means, like, five million.

1896
01:59:29,538 --> 01:59:31,081
- Yeah.
- Well.

1897
01:59:31,165 --> 01:59:33,000
Good luck to you all.

1898
01:59:33,083 --> 01:59:34,710
- Okay. See, that's not fair.
- What!

1899
01:59:34,793 --> 01:59:35,937
- Come on.
- That's not right.

1900
01:59:35,961 --> 01:59:37,313
That's gonna make me really angry!

1901
01:59:37,337 --> 01:59:38,505
Not right now.

1902
01:59:38,589 --> 01:59:40,215
Oh, by the way...

1903
01:59:42,426 --> 01:59:44,928
Pay no attention to the curtain.

1904
01:59:47,848 --> 01:59:49,183
There is a curtain.

1905
01:59:49,266 --> 01:59:50,601
Go, go, go.

1906
01:59:59,985 --> 02:00:04,448
<i>Seeing is believing.
But is it truth?</i>

1907
02:00:04,531 --> 02:00:07,159
<i>Depends on your point of view.</i>

1908
02:00:07,242 --> 02:00:09,745
<i>Are you listening, Horsemen?</i>

1909
02:00:09,828 --> 02:00:14,166
<i>When you emerge, and you will,</i>

1910
02:00:14,249 --> 02:00:17,377
<i>I will be there waiting.</i>

1911
02:00:17,461 --> 02:00:23,050
<i>Because mark my words,
you will get what's coming to you</i>

1912
02:00:23,133 --> 02:00:25,761
<i>in ways you can't expect.</i>

1913
02:00:26,637 --> 02:00:29,306
<i>But very much deserve.</i>

1914
02:00:29,389 --> 02:00:32,517
<i>Because one thing I believe in</i>

1915
02:00:32,601 --> 02:00:36,480
<i>is an eye for an eye.</i>
