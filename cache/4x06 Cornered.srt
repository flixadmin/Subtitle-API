1
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,072
No, no, no!

2
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,399
Hey.

3
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,398
It's me.

4
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,672
I wanted to say that I was thinking about you and the kids.

5
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,718
I love you.

6
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,037
It's me.

7
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:57,155
I just wanted to say that I was
thinking about you and the kids, and -

8
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,910
- Morning.
- Afternoon.

9
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,271
Oh, really? Jesus.

10
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,268
You shouldn't have let me sleep.

11
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,357
You needed it.

12
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,357
Skyler, I don't entirely remember what happened last night.

13
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,438
I mean, I might have said some things that -

14
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,313
Did you know this Gale Boetticher person?

15
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,714
- Skyler, I can't even focus on -
- Gale Boetticher.

16
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,192
Did you know him?

17
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,633
My God. What-?

18
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,673
What exactly did I say last night?

19
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,711
Just enough.

20
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,830
Did you work together?

21
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,632
Who killed him?

22
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,034
Was it the people you work for?

23
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,115
Definitely not.

24
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,639
Was it somebody who...

25
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,830
...at some point, might wanna do the same to you?

26
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,919
I seriously doubt it. No.

27
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,193
God.

28
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,276
Oh, God.

29
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,630
I think I know what happened last night, Walt.

30
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,515
I know exactly what happened last night. I drank too much wine.

31
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,917
You told Hank...

32
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,556
...that the man he was looking for might still be out there.

33
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:12,197
That it might not be this Boetticher after all.

34
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,952
And I was up all night, wondering why you would say that to him.

35
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,593
Because I was drunk, Skyler.

36
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,793
No, but then I was remembering your black eye.

37
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,675
Your business disagreement that you don't wanna talk about.

38
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:31,793
Look, I don't want to talk about any of this. Ever.

39
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,275
The firewall, all right?

40
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,311
Church and state.

41
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,159
That's how we need to approach this thing.

42
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,436
And then I remembered the message you left me the other day...

43
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,829
...when you said you loved me.

44
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,633
When I heard that, I thought that maybe you -

45
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:59,038
I don't know, that you were regretting what's happened between us.

46
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,434
And I get that.

47
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,116
After last night, I...

48
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,234
Walt, I think you're scared.

49
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,990
I think that message was some kind of goodbye.

50
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,838
No, Skyler.

51
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,077
- I think last night was a cry for help.
- Oh, Jesus.

52
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,599
A cry for help?

53
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,473
I think some part of you wants Hank to catch you.

54
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,996
That is just...

55
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:33,069
That is it exactly. Yes.

56
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,316
You're like Dr. Joyce Brothers here.

57
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,509
God.

58
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,392
At least this would all be over.

59
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:42,832
Yeah, yeah, oh, there's a tremendous weight just lifted off of me.

60
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,076
Now I understand myself.

61
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,793
Thank you. Thank you.

62
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,560
Walt, I've said it before.

63
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,911
If you are in danger, we go to the police.

64
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,274
- I don't wanna hear about the police.
- I do not say that lightly.

65
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,471
I know what it could do to this family.

66
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,754
But if it's the only real choice we have,
if it's either that or you getting shot -

67
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,837
I don't wanna hear about the police.

68
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:12,079
You're not some hardened criminal, Walt.
You are in over your head.

69
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,430
That's what we'll tell them, the truth.

70
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,108
- That is not the truth.
- Of course it is.

71
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,471
A schoolteacher, cancer, desperate for money...

72
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,717
- We're done here.
- Roped into working- Unable to quit.

73
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,876
You told me that yourself, Walt.

74
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,790
Jesus, what was I thinking? Walt, please.

75
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,595
Let's both of us stop trying to justify this whole thing...

76
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,392
...and admit you're in danger.

77
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,268
Who are you talking to right now?

78
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,993
Who is it you think you see?

79
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,274
Do you know how much I make a year?

80
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,153
I mean, even if I told you, you wouldn't believe it.

81
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,716
You know what would happen if I decided to stop going in to work?

82
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,038
A business big enough that it could
be listed on the NASDAQ goes belly up.

83
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,755
Disappears. It ceases to exist without me. No.

84
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,839
You clearly don't know who you're talking to,
so let me clue you in.

85
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,828
I am not in danger, Skyler. I am the danger.

86
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:15,953
A guy opens his door and gets shot, and you think that of me? No.

87
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,038
I am the one who knocks.

88
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,830
Look, I was...

89
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,837
Skyler?

90
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,756
Here we are. Just like you left it.

91
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,275
And where is your pretty wife?

92
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,872
She has other business to attend to.

93
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:54,315
Well, like I say to her, place sells as is. Understand?

94
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,951
Yes, I understand.

95
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,071
Good, good.

96
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,714
I don't want her coming back with more demands.

97
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,354
She gave me hard time when we settled on price.

98
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,677
We're all on the same page, Bogdan.

99
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,760
So here is everything you need.

100
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,679
- I keep very good files.
- Thank you.

101
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,199
So you are the boss now, huh?

102
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,557
You think you're ready?

103
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,799
Yes, I think so.

104
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,792
Being boss is tough.

105
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,151
I know you think I was hard on you, but you'll learn.

106
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,079
Being in charge is not easy.

107
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,079
It takes hard work.

108
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,477
- You've seen me work hard, Bogdan.
- Yeah?

109
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,636
I don't know.

110
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,671
Not so much, maybe.

111
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,269
But maybe when you are the boss...

112
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,268
...you will just keep your feet up and relax.

113
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,433
The real important thing -

114
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,119
And not everyone knows this.

115
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,914
Is to be tough.

116
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:12,069
Boss has to be tough.

117
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,114
Has to say no to people.

118
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:21,390
Has to make cashiers wipe down cars...

119
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,149
...even if they don't want to.

120
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,077
Can you be tough, Walter?

121
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,839
I am sure you can handle.

122
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:40,875
And if not, you can always call your wife, no?

123
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,833
- Always sticky.
- Yeah.

124
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,553
No problem.

125
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,557
As is.

126
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,754
Who'd have thought that someday I
would be handing these keys to you?

127
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,956
Many years. Almost forgot.

128
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,632
Bogdan.

129
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,393
As is.

130
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,592
Thank you.

131
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,915
You okay there?

132
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,798
I'm fine.

133
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,713
Just not using is...

134
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,558
Eat something.

135
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,759
Yeah?

136
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,230
That's right, both of them.

137
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,559
All right.

138
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,511
I'm on my way.

139
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,231
You need any help?

140
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,233
No.

141
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,315
You want me to call her back?

142
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,400
No. No.

143
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,239
What exactly did she say? I mean, exactly.

144
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:19,150
Just, you know, she asked if I was okay and not to worry.

145
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,918
Like that.

146
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,713
Any rough timetable on this thing, as to when she's coming home?

147
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,953
It's about the gambling, right?

148
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,393
Well, it's kind of hard to -

149
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,556
Dad, she can't understand.

150
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:45,117
It's not like you're doing this on purpose. You can't help it.

151
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,031
It's not that simple.

152
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:53,234
Look, you have a disease. It's like you're an alcoholic, right?

153
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,830
- No, it's not. Not at all.
- Yes, it is. I read online.

154
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,634
She's not even allowed to be mad at you.

155
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,434
She can't be mad at you about the cancer, can she?

156
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,949
Son, these are two very different things.

157
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,357
Not really. Gambling addiction is a sickness.

158
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,074
- You can't -
- Listen, what is going on with me...

159
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,794
...is not about some disease. It's about choices.

160
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,433
Choices that I have made.

161
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,191
Choices I stand by.

162
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,634
You're not moving back in, are you?

163
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,559
No.

164
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:49,030
Hey, you know what? School can wait.

165
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:53,518
Why don't we take a little detour?

166
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,674
What kind of detour?

167
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,432
You'll see.

168
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,717
Charlie, pick up line three. Line three, Charlie.

169
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,594
I think it's time we got you your own car. What do you think?

170
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,273
What?

171
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,513
I think if you're gonna buy me off...

172
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,235
...buy me off.

173
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,271
Get an attendant over to the lot.

174
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,109
- Amazing. It's amazing.
- Yeah. It's good-looking.

175
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,993
That's good. I'm glad you like it.

176
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,670
- I do. Thank you, Dad.
- All right. You're welcome.

177
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,874
So you're here.

178
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,438
Yeah.

179
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,550
You're actually here? To work?

180
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,552
Yeah, man. Jesus.

181
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,079
Jesse.

182
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,714
Come here.

183
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,753
- All right, I need an update.
- Update on what?

184
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:40,158
An update on these little field trips
that you've been taking with Mike.

185
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:44,911
I told you already. We pick up money.
Check on things. Stuff like that.

186
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:50,629
And you're his bodyguard, right? What? That's what you said.

187
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,637
I said I guarded him.

188
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:57,391
Like backup, like a second set of eyes.
Everybody needs backup, right?

189
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,549
And this has to be you?

190
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:05,118
It can't be, I don't know, Tyrus or any
of the couple dozen muscle-heads...

191
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:09,154
...that Gus has working for him? It has to be Jesse Pinkman.

192
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,239
Why? What, is there something about you that I don't know?

193
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,635
Are you a former Navy SEAL?

194
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,070
Your hands registered as lethal weapons?

195
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,269
Register this.

196
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,790
All I'm saying is that do you not even question this?

197
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,151
Do you really believe that you mean anything to these people?

198
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:29,272
Not trying to insult. Just trying to make you see things.

199
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:33,155
I see they can't outright kill me,
but they don't want me getting high.

200
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,512
I see this thing probably started
as Gus getting Mike to babysit me.

201
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,559
But you know what?

202
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:44,390
I saved Mike from getting robbed, even killed, maybe.

203
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,195
So maybe I'm not such a loser after all.

204
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,757
I mean, what if it-? Oh, God.

205
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:05,436
- All right. What if it's all just a setup?
- What?

206
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:09,679
What if this robbery that you stopped wasn't even real?

207
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,952
I mean, think about it. Your first day out guarding Mike.

208
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,435
He steps out for one second and what happens?

209
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,552
- You immediately get robbed.
- You are such an asshole.

210
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:22,070
Keep your friends close, your enemies closer. Like you said...

211
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:25,750
...Gus can't kill you because of me,
he knows I won't stand for it.

212
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,871
He hates the fact that he needs me.

213
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,595
What does he do? He goes to work
driving a wedge between you and me.

214
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,360
If you'd been there, you'd know it wasn't a setup.

215
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,916
Wait a minute. How long did those guys chase you, huh?

216
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:41,795
Because the way you describe it, they gave up pretty damn easy.

217
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:47,320
No, no, this whole thing, all of this...

218
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,110
...it's all about me.

219
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,713
Hello?

220
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,029
Look, just hang on.

221
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,834
Yeah?

222
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,119
I'll be right up.

223
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,199
- What?
- I gotta go.

224
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,915
What? Am I supposed to clean all this on my own?

225
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,032
Hey.

226
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,233
God -

227
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,033
Buenos dias, ladies, buenos dias.

228
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,719
Do you speak English?

229
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,309
- No.
- No, okay.

230
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,037
Help, help.

231
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,429
I need help to clean. Yes.

232
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,992
- Yes, muy bueno. It's just this -
- No.

233
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,557
No, no, no.

234
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,118
No, no, no.

235
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,152
No, no, ladies.

236
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:33,794
Let me see, let me see. I tell you what.
I tell you what. Look, look.

237
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,638
Universal language.

238
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,516
This one for you. Yeah, sí.

239
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,076
Sí, Presidente Grant. Very important man.

240
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,758
Mas dinero after the -

241
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,675
Are we good?

242
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,953
I think we're good. I think we listened to you.
Please, por favor, por favor.

243
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,869
Please, por favor, por favor.

244
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,591
Yes.

245
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,715
What's the deal?

246
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:50,030
Well, the deal is, we're watching that house.

247
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,194
Couple down on the left with the tree in the front.

248
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,152
Yeah? What for?

249
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,635
A little birdie told me there's some guys...

250
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,912
...that have 3 pounds of our product which they're selling.

251
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,237
And which they sure as hell didn't get from us.

252
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,112
So, what's the plan?

253
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,639
I just told you.

254
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,434
We sit here and watch that house...

255
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:16,313
...until one of our entrepreneurs pops his head out.

256
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:20,035
Then we ask a few questions and get our property back.

257
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,960
Why don't you just go break the door down...

258
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,958
...pistol-whip those bitches and show them who's boss?

259
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:31,472
Because a little birdie also told me
these guys are into the product...

260
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,671
...and most likely armed.

261
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:37,236
Now, what you may not know about meth-heads -

262
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,517
Or maybe you do.

263
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,995
They're kind of unpredictable.

264
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:46,034
I don't care for unpredictable. So we wait.

265
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:51,679
Sorry to burst your bubble, kid, but that's 90 percent of the job.

266
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,634
Don't worry. I brought sandwiches.

267
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,032
Yes, sir.

268
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:07,791
Pimento cheese. How's that sound?

269
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,309
Where you going?

270
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:20,314
You said they're selling right? Maybe I'm looking to buy.

271
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,029
Who the hell are you?

272
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,471
- Tucker! Tucker!
- I'm here to buy.

273
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,114
- Will you shut the damn door?
- Not my question.

274
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,915
Name's Diesel. Heard you maybe had some of the blue.

275
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,680
- Tucker. Shut the door, Tucker! Tucker!
- I just -

276
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,440
- Just looking for a teenth, yo.
- Tucker!

277
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,631
- Come on, help a brother out.
- Tucker!

278
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,150
- Will you shut the damn door?
- We don't sell to strangers.

279
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,555
- Tucker!
- Get off the porch, asshole.

280
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,115
- Will you shut the door?
- All right already!

281
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,151
Tucker!

282
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,439
Guess we'll go with Plan A, then.

283
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,474
- Pop the trunk, would you?
- Why?

284
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:51,752
- There's something in there I need.
- And what would that be?

285
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,235
I'm getting those pricks out of that house.

286
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,193
Oh, your first attempt being such a wild success?

287
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,631
You may know this whole PI sit-in-the-car business...

288
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:03,149
...but I know meth-heads.

289
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,152
What are you doing?

290
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,275
Digging.

291
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,719
Why?

292
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,957
You know why.

293
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,153
How deep are you going?

294
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:07,989
I don't know. How deep do you think it is?

295
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,152
Pretty deep.

296
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:24,794
Hey, you mind taking over for a minute?

297
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:28,159
Yeah, sure.

298
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:42,235
- Hey, mind if I use your john?
- Yeah.

299
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,112
Tucker.

300
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,717
Tucker!

301
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,557
Tucker!

302
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,236
Who the hell are you?

303
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,032
- I just -
- Who the hell are you?

304
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:31,437
It's cool. Hey, I'm a friend of Tucker's.

305
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:37,033
- What do you want?
- I just wanna buy some of the blue.

306
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,912
It's not for sale.

307
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,550
I know you were selling it earlier -

308
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:46,594
- Oh, yeah? How do you know that?
- Tucker told me.

309
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,712
Yeah, Tucker needs to learn to keep his damn mouth shut.

310
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,956
Tucker! Tucker!

311
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,876
So you gonna hook me up?

312
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:01,153
Don't have enough for all of Tucker's asshole friends. Tucker!

313
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:05,434
You know, I think he's outside. You wanna just go outside -

314
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:10,634
- Tucker! Tucker!
- Hey, hey. Let's go find Tucker.

315
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,478
Okay? Let's go outside.

316
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:17,071
I don't have enough for you, all right?

317
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:22,115
Yeah. yeah. Yeah, I get it. Okay.

318
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,393
- I don't wanna start any trouble.
- Trouble? What's that mean? Trouble?

319
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:29,512
No, no, no. I'm just saying we're cool, okay?

320
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,869
- We're good.
- What?

321
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,275
You can't know that. What does that mean?

322
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:37,553
You don't put thoughts in my head.
You don't put thoughts in my head.

323
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,957
- Absolutely. You're right. You're right.
- Tucker?

324
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,599
You -

325
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,877
Here you go, Maria.

326
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,513
Veronica.

327
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,756
Ilia, gracias.

328
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,394
I missed that one. I'm sure it was good.

329
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,796
Wait, where you taking them?

330
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,959
- Come on, Tyrus, what are you doing?
- I'm putting them on a bus.

331
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,993
- Why? What bus?
- One that takes them back to Honduras.

332
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,589
Hey, wait a second. Wait a minute.

333
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,231
Wait, wait. This was my idea. Don't punish them.

334
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,159
You tell Gus to blame me, not them.

335
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,558
He does.

336
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,359
Give us a minute, will you?

337
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,271
We won't be too long.

338
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,800
The crew that hit our truck gave away the cargo...

339
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,877
...to a couple local nobodies.

340
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:03,470
Very disciplined of them, not keeping anything for themselves.

341
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,319
It was all about sending a message.

342
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:09,148
Which they did, literally.

343
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,749
It was written on the bucket lid.

344
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,078
"Ready to talk?"

345
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,392
That, I believe, is the English translation.

346
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:23,636
I know you're not really asking for advice.

347
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:29,278
But let me hire 10, 15 more good operators.

348
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,074
Then we hit them hard. Hit them where they live.

349
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,634
No. This war stays cold for now.

350
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,235
What about their message? What's the answer?

351
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,759
Set up a meeting. Let's see what they have to say.

352
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,677
How did he do today?

353
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,230
I hear you can handle yourself.

354
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,038
I guess.

355
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,518
Good night.

356
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,917
Hey, excuse me?

357
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,352
Why me?

358
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,798
I like to think I see things in people.

359
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:02,558
Slow down. The car is not going anywhere.

360
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,716
- Mom.
- Hey, sweetheart.

361
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,593
- Hi.
- Hey.

362
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,791
- So did you see what's in the driveway?
- There you go.

363
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,591
Yeah, I saw.

364
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,558
Hey.

365
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,632
So that's yours, huh?

366
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,149
Yeah. Dad got it for me.

367
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,555
Well, that was very nice of him.

368
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,759
Yeah.

369
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,952
I know it looks like...

370
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:40,756
...well, awesome, but it's super safe.

371
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,313
Dad made sure.

372
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,671
And I promise to always go the speed limit. Or below.

373
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,949
Way below.

374
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:51,517
And it gets great gas mileage.

375
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:57,396
So Dad said I can take it around the block a few times. That okay?

376
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,916
Just around the block.

377
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,998
Yeah. Just around the block.

378
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:06,870
- And be careful, okay?
- I will.

379
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,073
Bye.

380
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:15,229
It's really- It's really great to have you home, Mom.

381
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,834
Hey, seriously, be careful. Okay?

382
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,837
- I will.
- Okay.

383
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,116
I guess we should talk.

384
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,314
Well, I think you said plenty the other day.

385
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:53,195
Look, about that, it just...

386
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:56,308
Did you get the car wash keys?

387
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:00,915
Yes. Yes. Here.

388
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:13,116
Skyler, I may have overstated things earlier...

389
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:17,279
...and I'm sorry to be so forward.

390
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,595
But I just - I want you to know something.

391
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,358
I want you to -

392
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:26,120
I need you to understand...

393
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:28,396
...that you are safe.

394
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:33,720
You, Junior, Holly. You are completely safe.

395
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,555
Everything that I do, everything...

396
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,832
...I do it to protect this family.

397
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:47,432
So buying that car, that was protecting your family?

398
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,559
Okay. I...

399
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:57,278
All right, maybe it's a little flashy, but he needed a car...

400
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:02,359
...and I'm his father, and I should be able to get what he wants.

401
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,430
It goes back.

402
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,109
Tomorrow.

403
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:12,632
Skyler, it will crush him.

404
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,509
That car directly contradicts our story.

405
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:21,072
And if you're so invested in protecting this family...

406
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,999
...it means protecting the story.

407
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,953
What do you think the neighbours are gonna say, Walt?

408
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,593
What about Hank and Marie?

409
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:32,510
How about the IRS? What were you thinking, Walt?

410
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:37,271
I was thinking that I wanted to do something nice for my son.

411
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,239
Look.

412
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:52,517
I just worry that he'll blame you for this.

413
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,798
Oh, he will.

414
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,709
Once again, he'll blame his bitch mother...

415
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:04,674
...for taking away what his loving father has given him...

416
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,236
...so thanks for that.

417
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,710
But you know what, Walt?

418
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,351
Someone has to protect this family...

419
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:17,677
...from the man who protects this family.
