1
00:00:00,312 --> 00:00:02,164
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:02,165 --> 00:00:04,625
For 7 years, I have fought
with only one goal...

3
00:00:04,626 --> 00:00:06,148
to save my city,

4
00:00:06,149 --> 00:00:07,759
but now a new threat has emerged,

5
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,554
a danger so severe, it has forced me

6
00:00:09,555 --> 00:00:11,371
to leave my family in order to face it,

7
00:00:11,372 --> 00:00:13,852
and it won't be enough for
me to just be the Green Arrow.

8
00:00:13,853 --> 00:00:15,506
To prevent the crisis that's coming,

9
00:00:15,507 --> 00:00:17,682
I am going to have to
become someone else.

10
00:00:17,683 --> 00:00:20,338
I am going to have to
become... something else.

11
00:00:21,469 --> 00:00:22,861
Previously on "Arrow"...

12
00:00:22,862 --> 00:00:24,988
Earth-2 is... gone.

13
00:00:24,989 --> 00:00:26,473
The destruction of that Earth was

14
00:00:26,474 --> 00:00:28,040
a necessary sacrifice.

15
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:31,445
Mar Novu is not trying to
prevent what's going to happen

16
00:00:31,446 --> 00:00:33,219
because he's gonna be what causes it.

17
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,743
John Diggle is my adoptive father.

18
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:37,919
- Thanks, Mr. Diggles.
- Call me Dig.

19
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,487
We have to take out the Deathstroke.

20
00:00:42,621 --> 00:00:45,010
- Zoe!
- JJ!

21
00:00:55,547 --> 00:00:56,896
Dad?

22
00:00:59,202 --> 00:01:01,726
Dad?

23
00:01:01,727 --> 00:01:04,817
Oh, my God. Dad!

24
00:01:07,515 --> 00:01:10,648
W-William? William?

25
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:13,826
Hey.

26
00:01:19,135 --> 00:01:21,963
Mia?

27
00:01:21,964 --> 00:01:23,487
Dad!

28
00:01:23,488 --> 00:01:25,706
Well, you're so young.

29
00:01:25,707 --> 00:01:28,056
Dad?

30
00:01:28,057 --> 00:01:29,754
What is this? How did we get here?

31
00:01:29,755 --> 00:01:31,844
I... I don't know.

32
00:01:34,281 --> 00:01:36,630
Those are my kids.

33
00:01:36,631 --> 00:01:38,545
Your kids.

34
00:01:38,546 --> 00:01:41,374
Are you... are you okay?

35
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:43,158
H-How is this real?

36
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:45,476
Good question. The last time I checked,

37
00:01:45,477 --> 00:01:48,555
you didn't have an adult
daughter or any daughter.

38
00:01:48,556 --> 00:01:51,515
We had a daughter...

39
00:01:51,516 --> 00:01:53,517
And we named her Mia.

40
00:01:53,518 --> 00:01:56,520
Felicity gave birth a few
months after we left Star City.

41
00:01:56,521 --> 00:02:00,175
How? I... I didn't even
know she was pregnant.

42
00:02:00,176 --> 00:02:01,525
We didn't tell anyone.

43
00:02:01,526 --> 00:02:03,570
We wanted to keep her off the grid

44
00:02:03,571 --> 00:02:05,529
to protect her.

45
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:07,488
That was only a few months ago.

46
00:02:10,143 --> 00:02:11,839
This is Novu.

47
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,537
You called me Dad.

48
00:02:13,538 --> 00:02:15,495
You adopted me.

49
00:02:15,496 --> 00:02:17,018
Remember? It's Connor.

50
00:02:17,019 --> 00:02:22,241
No. No. I... I... I haven't.

51
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:27,115
He hasn't because he hasn't yet.

52
00:02:27,116 --> 00:02:29,683
Look. What are you talking about?

53
00:02:29,684 --> 00:02:31,555
I think we're in the past.

54
00:02:31,556 --> 00:02:34,079
- That is insane.
- Look at this place.

55
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,603
It's new, and them!

56
00:02:36,604 --> 00:02:38,039
No gray hair, no wrinkles,

57
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,608
and we are staring at our dad alive

58
00:02:41,609 --> 00:02:43,741
instead of at his tombstone.

59
00:02:43,742 --> 00:02:45,743
I'm sorry. What year is this?

60
00:02:45,744 --> 00:02:49,921
2-2... uh, it's 2019.

61
00:02:49,922 --> 00:02:52,619
What year is it supposed to be?

62
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,013
2040.

64
00:03:01,934 --> 00:03:03,613
Wait. So an hour ago,

65
00:03:03,614 --> 00:03:05,371
I was just with Ben
Turner's 6-year-old child,

66
00:03:05,372 --> 00:03:07,286
and now he's an adult,
and now I'm his father?

67
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:09,723
At least you didn't throw
up like you usually do.

68
00:03:09,724 --> 00:03:10,985
Just saying.

69
00:03:10,986 --> 00:03:12,362
I'm genuinely sorry that both of you

70
00:03:12,363 --> 00:03:14,206
found out this way,

71
00:03:14,207 --> 00:03:18,123
about Mia, about the Monitor.

72
00:03:18,124 --> 00:03:20,038
Felicity and I wanted to tell you.

73
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:21,692
Oliver, as far as excuses go,

74
00:03:21,693 --> 00:03:24,129
a cosmic being asking
you to sacrifice your life

75
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:27,654
to save the entire universe
is a... pretty good one.

76
00:03:27,655 --> 00:03:30,701
Look. Those kids have 20
years of stuff we don't know.

77
00:03:30,702 --> 00:03:33,138
When are we gonna be able
to ask them what happens?

78
00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:34,705
I think we should give them their space,

79
00:03:34,706 --> 00:03:37,098
and when they're ready, they'll open up.

80
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:39,448
Okay. Laurel's on her way to Star City.

81
00:03:39,449 --> 00:03:42,234
I can't believe her
entire Earth is just gone.

82
00:03:42,235 --> 00:03:44,671
I don't understand. Why didn't
the Monitor bring her here?

83
00:03:44,672 --> 00:03:46,630
Or grown-up JJ or Zoe?

84
00:03:46,631 --> 00:03:47,848
What game is he playing?

85
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:50,721
I don't know,

86
00:03:50,722 --> 00:03:51,765
but we have to stop him.

87
00:03:51,766 --> 00:03:54,725
How do we stop a God?

88
00:03:54,726 --> 00:03:56,422
I'm working on it.

89
00:03:56,423 --> 00:03:59,773
Okay. How did this happen?
This can't be real.

90
00:03:59,774 --> 00:04:02,863
Well, it is.

91
00:04:02,864 --> 00:04:04,909
Hey. Are you okay?

92
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:07,651
I'm fine. Yeah. Just please tell me

93
00:04:07,652 --> 00:04:09,957
that you were able to get JJ.

94
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:14,353
I had him, and I was gonna... kill him,

95
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:17,791
and the next thing I
know, I'm... I'm here.

96
00:04:17,792 --> 00:04:19,445
So he's still out there.

97
00:04:19,446 --> 00:04:21,578
You mean, out there
20 years in the future

98
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:23,371
unless you're talking
about the current JJ,

99
00:04:23,372 --> 00:04:24,634
who'd be, like, what, 5?

100
00:04:24,635 --> 00:04:28,062
And you're not gonna thwick him.

101
00:04:28,063 --> 00:04:30,221
Mia?

102
00:04:30,222 --> 00:04:32,197
No, I'm not, okay?

103
00:04:32,198 --> 00:04:33,894
How does this even work, all right?

104
00:04:33,895 --> 00:04:36,070
Because my dad doesn't
even know who I am,

105
00:04:36,071 --> 00:04:38,235
and if he finds out
about JJ, what he did,

106
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:41,902
what I... what I almost did,

107
00:04:41,903 --> 00:04:43,469
he won't want to.

108
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:46,124
So don't tell him.

109
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:48,213
Don't tell anyone anything.

110
00:04:48,214 --> 00:04:50,694
- Are you serious?
- She's right.

111
00:04:50,695 --> 00:04:52,696
This is original Team
Arrow we're talking about.

112
00:04:52,697 --> 00:04:54,147
They are gonna know something's up.

113
00:04:54,148 --> 00:04:56,130
Do you want to tell
Rene his daughter's dead

114
00:04:56,131 --> 00:04:59,462
or tell John that his
son's the one who did it?

115
00:04:59,463 --> 00:05:01,401
What's done is done.

116
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:12,472
Wow. This place
looks exactly like it did

117
00:05:12,473 --> 00:05:14,152
when I was 13,

118
00:05:14,153 --> 00:05:18,112
which makes sense because
I guess I still am.

119
00:05:18,113 --> 00:05:19,334
Sorry about the boxes.

120
00:05:19,335 --> 00:05:21,482
Felicity and I left pretty suddenly

121
00:05:21,483 --> 00:05:23,074
to get to the cabin,

122
00:05:23,075 --> 00:05:24,945
and we had planned to

123
00:05:24,946 --> 00:05:27,905
come back here with both
of you at some point.

124
00:05:27,906 --> 00:05:32,560
Yeah. That, um, didn't really work out.

125
00:05:32,561 --> 00:05:34,781
Because I died?

126
00:05:34,782 --> 00:05:36,740
We don't know exactly.

127
00:05:36,741 --> 00:05:39,004
You just sort of disappeared.

128
00:05:41,963 --> 00:05:45,499
So did, uh... looks like the two of you

129
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:49,404
got a chance to... to
grow up with each other.

130
00:05:49,405 --> 00:05:54,018
Um... actually, um, Mia and I

131
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:56,847
just found out about
each other recently.

132
00:05:56,848 --> 00:05:58,762
I never saw Felicity growing up,

133
00:05:58,763 --> 00:06:01,852
and... and after I left here,

134
00:06:01,853 --> 00:06:04,115
I never saw you again.

135
00:06:04,116 --> 00:06:07,031
Yeah. After you died, it was, um,

136
00:06:07,032 --> 00:06:08,903
just me and Mom at the cabin.

137
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:14,255
I'm sorry that I wasn't
there for the two of you.

138
00:06:14,256 --> 00:06:16,214
However, we are here now.

139
00:06:16,215 --> 00:06:18,782
Um, why don't we sit down,

140
00:06:18,783 --> 00:06:21,785
and you guys can catch
me up to speed or...

141
00:06:21,786 --> 00:06:23,787
On 20 years?

142
00:06:23,788 --> 00:06:26,267
It doesn't really work that way.

143
00:06:26,268 --> 00:06:28,813
Even if it did, I'm just... I'm tired.

144
00:06:28,814 --> 00:06:32,056
I want to sleep, and I... you know?

145
00:06:32,057 --> 00:06:36,756
Yep. Well, the bedroom is right there.

146
00:06:36,757 --> 00:06:38,802
Just please make yourself at home, okay?

147
00:06:38,803 --> 00:06:40,239
Yeah. Sure.

148
00:06:42,545 --> 00:06:43,764
Night.

149
00:06:49,378 --> 00:06:51,945
This is gonna be... interesting.

150
00:06:51,946 --> 00:06:53,513
Who are you calling?

151
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,252
Felicity. She needs to know that

152
00:06:58,253 --> 00:06:59,300
the two of you are back.

153
00:06:59,301 --> 00:07:01,302
- You can't.
- Why?

154
00:07:01,303 --> 00:07:04,610
Look. I'm not exactly how sure
this time travel thing works.

155
00:07:04,611 --> 00:07:07,395
Maybe we shouldn't...
bring Mom into this

156
00:07:07,396 --> 00:07:09,006
until we have a better understanding

157
00:07:09,007 --> 00:07:11,835
of what... this is.

158
00:07:11,836 --> 00:07:13,402
That's a good point.

159
00:07:15,883 --> 00:07:17,362
William, tell me something good

160
00:07:17,363 --> 00:07:20,191
about the future, please.

161
00:07:20,192 --> 00:07:23,934
Well... you know those computer projects

162
00:07:23,935 --> 00:07:25,979
that I would work on in my room

163
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,112
when I wasn't talking to you?

164
00:07:28,113 --> 00:07:30,984
- Yeah.
- I turned that teen angst

165
00:07:30,985 --> 00:07:35,075
into a multibillion-dollar tech empire.

166
00:07:35,076 --> 00:07:37,121
- What?
- Kind of a Mogul.

167
00:07:37,122 --> 00:07:40,428
That's phenomenal. That's, um...

168
00:07:40,429 --> 00:07:43,562
I get the feeling I'm gonna be really...

169
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:47,305
really, really proud
of how you turned out.

170
00:07:47,306 --> 00:07:54,007
Yeah. Well, um... I
didn't just turn out.

171
00:07:54,008 --> 00:07:57,533
Um... there's something
I should tell you.

172
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,800
I'm gay.

173
00:08:06,716 --> 00:08:09,196
Yeah, buddy. I know.

174
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:13,026
- You know?
- Yeah.

175
00:08:13,027 --> 00:08:14,985
Felicity and I knew,

176
00:08:14,986 --> 00:08:17,944
and we just, um...

177
00:08:17,945 --> 00:08:21,426
well, we hoped that you were gonna

178
00:08:21,427 --> 00:08:23,950
come out to us when
you were comfortable.

179
00:08:23,951 --> 00:08:26,039
You clearly didn't get that chance,

180
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:31,088
and that's on me, so... I'm sorry.

181
00:08:31,089 --> 00:08:34,178
Dad, we all have the chance
to get to know each other now.

182
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:35,788
If your sister will let me.

183
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:37,877
Mia will come around.

184
00:08:37,878 --> 00:08:40,314
You know, she can be a little
bit... a little bit stubborn

185
00:08:40,315 --> 00:08:43,491
and... hard to reach sometimes.

186
00:08:43,492 --> 00:08:45,145
Shocker. Where'd she get that from?

187
00:08:45,146 --> 00:08:48,323
- Mom, I guess.
- Ha ha ha...

188
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:58,289
My husband needs help.

189
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:00,204
Um, did you check in at the desk?

190
00:09:00,205 --> 00:09:03,163
We're donors here.

191
00:09:03,164 --> 00:09:04,773
Hold this.

192
00:09:06,211 --> 00:09:08,168
I'm just gonna have a look.

193
00:09:09,867 --> 00:09:11,955
Run! Bomb!

194
00:09:25,036 --> 00:09:27,621
Starling General was attacked last night

195
00:09:27,622 --> 00:09:31,228
after a bomb was found
inside Archroyal Capital CEO

196
00:09:31,229 --> 00:09:32,728
MacMillan Fairfield.

197
00:09:32,729 --> 00:09:34,947
Authorities believe
the infamous terrorist

198
00:09:34,948 --> 00:09:37,689
Deathstroke orchestrated the attack.

199
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:40,431
Please tell me the City's
better in the future.

200
00:09:40,432 --> 00:09:41,911
Yeah, yeah, definitely.

201
00:09:41,912 --> 00:09:43,826
- You think this is Slade?
- No. No, no.

202
00:09:43,827 --> 00:09:45,218
I have A.R.G.U.S. keeping tabs.

203
00:09:45,219 --> 00:09:46,509
He's currently in Buredunia,

204
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:47,610
which is nowhere near Star City.

205
00:09:47,611 --> 00:09:49,288
Neither is his son, Kane Wolfman.

206
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:50,884
So this is someone new?

207
00:09:50,885 --> 00:09:53,569
Yep. Someone has co-opted
the Deathstroke mask,

208
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:55,484
and they're using it
to terrorize the City.

209
00:09:55,485 --> 00:09:56,563
We need motive.

210
00:09:56,564 --> 00:09:58,640
Well, the vic is some
rich wall street type,

211
00:09:58,641 --> 00:10:00,971
and those guys are easy to hate.

212
00:10:00,972 --> 00:10:02,954
We're not all bad.

213
00:10:02,955 --> 00:10:05,048
- He's a billionaire.
- Say what?!

214
00:10:05,049 --> 00:10:07,439
Please tell me Zoe is, too. How is Zoe?

215
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,220
I mean, are you guys still friends?

216
00:10:10,413 --> 00:10:13,582
Yeah. She's... you'd be proud.

217
00:10:15,201 --> 00:10:17,289
Heh. Hello, bunker!

218
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:19,444
Oh, it feels so good to be back.

219
00:10:19,445 --> 00:10:20,596
Wait. Are those the
kids from the future?

220
00:10:20,597 --> 00:10:22,207
Those are definitely the kids
from the future! Oh, my God,

221
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:23,253
and excuse me. When were you
gonna tell me about this,

222
00:10:23,254 --> 00:10:24,802
Councilman Ramirez? This is so cool.

223
00:10:24,803 --> 00:10:25,968
I may have had coffee on the plane,

224
00:10:25,969 --> 00:10:27,443
and by "may have", I mean
I definitely did have it.

225
00:10:27,444 --> 00:10:29,896
It's candidate Ramirez.
We don't know if I win yet.

226
00:10:29,897 --> 00:10:31,768
Uh, did you miss the part where
these kids are from the future?

227
00:10:31,769 --> 00:10:36,002
Okay. Rene, if you really want to know,

228
00:10:36,003 --> 00:10:37,537
you become Mayor.

229
00:10:37,538 --> 00:10:39,338
Seriously? Hoo hoo hoo!

230
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:41,784
Oh, that's a text from D.

231
00:10:41,785 --> 00:10:43,395
I will let her know about Slade

232
00:10:43,396 --> 00:10:47,399
and gloat that I'm gonna be her boss.

233
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,125
Uh, William, we should,
uh, go, let them work.

234
00:10:50,126 --> 00:10:51,344
Wait. But I just got here,

235
00:10:51,345 --> 00:10:52,997
and I have so many questions,

236
00:10:52,998 --> 00:10:54,892
starting with why did nobody
say anything about my beard?

237
00:10:54,893 --> 00:10:57,220
It's good to see you, Curtis.
Your beard looks tremendous, okay?

238
00:10:57,221 --> 00:11:00,096
I mean, work or otherwise,
I'd like you to stay.

239
00:11:00,097 --> 00:11:01,938
Yeah. No. I just, um...

240
00:11:01,939 --> 00:11:04,488
I'd rather see the City than the bunker.

241
00:11:04,489 --> 00:11:06,838
Let's go.

242
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:09,841
I can't believe that's
your son, that's William.

243
00:11:09,842 --> 00:11:12,844
I can, however, definitely
believe that that is your daughter.

244
00:11:12,845 --> 00:11:14,078
- Okay.
- Yeah.

245
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:15,602
Speaking of which, I'm a little upset

246
00:11:15,603 --> 00:11:17,055
you didn't tell me about her,
but that's okay.

247
00:11:17,056 --> 00:11:20,112
I forgive you. So why'd
you call in the big guns?

248
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:21,940
- You know Earth-2?
- Yeah.

249
00:11:21,941 --> 00:11:24,639
Well, yeah. It was destroyed
by a wave of energy.

250
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,893
This fabric was clipped
by it, and I would like you

251
00:11:27,894 --> 00:11:30,819
to try and help me
figure out what it is.

252
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,652
I can track down some equipment.

253
00:11:32,653 --> 00:11:34,736
It might... take a bit.

254
00:11:34,737 --> 00:11:36,781
The reason why I would help.

255
00:11:36,782 --> 00:11:39,349
It's a wave of energy that's
powerful enough to destroy a planet,

256
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:42,874
so it's probably powerful
enough to stop a God,

257
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:46,617
which is... what we're doing now.

258
00:11:46,618 --> 00:11:49,185
God. You said God. Um, so the fate

259
00:11:49,186 --> 00:11:51,666
of the universe is in my hands.

260
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:54,886
Cool, cool, cool. Yeah.
You guys... I got it. Ahem.

261
00:11:54,887 --> 00:11:59,047
Hey. Lyla is still off the grid,

262
00:11:59,048 --> 00:12:02,590
but she'll be very happy to see you.

263
00:12:02,591 --> 00:12:06,115
You know, we always
wanted a brother for JJ.

264
00:12:06,116 --> 00:12:10,148
- You and he close?
- Yeah. Best friends.

265
00:12:10,149 --> 00:12:11,546
Glad to hear that.

266
00:12:11,547 --> 00:12:13,485
I didn't know this was
Bring Your Kid to Work Day.

267
00:12:13,486 --> 00:12:15,385
Eh. Thought I might be able to help.

268
00:12:15,386 --> 00:12:17,692
Connor was an agent at an
organization called Knightwatch.

269
00:12:17,693 --> 00:12:19,955
It makes A.R.G.U.S. look
like a kindergarten class.

270
00:12:19,956 --> 00:12:22,261
The Canaries are comparable, though.

271
00:12:22,262 --> 00:12:24,699
Canaries?

272
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,179
Forget it. What do you got?

273
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,094
Uh, found this on the vic,

274
00:12:29,095 --> 00:12:30,792
what was left of him.

275
00:12:30,793 --> 00:12:32,794
May I?

276
00:12:32,795 --> 00:12:35,100
Yeah.

277
00:12:35,101 --> 00:12:36,885
I've seen this before.

278
00:12:36,886 --> 00:12:39,666
A, um, terrorist organization,

279
00:12:39,667 --> 00:12:41,846
they use these to deliver messages.

280
00:12:41,847 --> 00:12:43,500
Do you have a black light?

281
00:12:43,501 --> 00:12:46,808
Yeah, but we ran the inks on
it already. Nothing turned up.

282
00:12:46,809 --> 00:12:50,725
That is because you checked it dry.

283
00:12:50,726 --> 00:12:53,597
- Whoa. Okay. So that's our motive.
- _

284
00:12:53,598 --> 00:12:55,599
That's good work, Connor.

285
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,775
Is there something else you recognize?

286
00:12:57,776 --> 00:12:59,516
No. Uh, that's it.

287
00:13:02,433 --> 00:13:05,997
And that is Mia, so I should probably...

288
00:13:05,998 --> 00:13:08,177
Go. Go, go, go. I'll
catch up with you later.

289
00:13:08,178 --> 00:13:10,483
It can't really be JJ, can it?

290
00:13:10,484 --> 00:13:12,616
Look. This all started
the night we got here.

291
00:13:12,617 --> 00:13:14,400
Maybe JJ came back, too.

292
00:13:14,401 --> 00:13:17,105
What, and the first thing he
decides to do is blow something up?

293
00:13:17,106 --> 00:13:18,231
It doesn't make any sense.

294
00:13:18,232 --> 00:13:19,971
It does if you know my brother.

295
00:13:19,972 --> 00:13:22,452
"Star City's cancer is the rich"...

296
00:13:22,453 --> 00:13:24,454
It's JJ's favorite catchphrase.

297
00:13:24,455 --> 00:13:27,182
Okay. We should tell Dad and the Team.

298
00:13:27,183 --> 00:13:30,129
Not a chance. This is
our mess to clean up.

299
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:31,398
But we could use their help.

300
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:34,587
I mean, maybe if JJ sees John, then...

301
00:13:34,588 --> 00:13:35,683
Look. He won't care.

302
00:13:35,684 --> 00:13:37,641
JJ will kill Dad if he gets in his way.

303
00:13:37,642 --> 00:13:38,860
This is on us.

304
00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:41,359
It's on us to avenge Zoe.

305
00:13:44,127 --> 00:13:47,390
Well, then first, we need to find him.

306
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,871
All right. You know him best.

307
00:13:49,872 --> 00:13:51,829
You know the Deathstroke.

308
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:54,658
Where would he go?

309
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:56,052
Where it all began.

310
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:01,665
Are you sure this is the place?

311
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:04,276
20 years from now, this
place is Galaxy One,

312
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:08,237
but 2019, it's where
the Deathstroke started.

313
00:14:08,238 --> 00:14:10,591
Oh. I am getting a case of deja vu

314
00:14:10,592 --> 00:14:11,980
in the worst possible way.

315
00:14:11,981 --> 00:14:13,024
You stay out of sight.

316
00:14:13,025 --> 00:14:14,547
Connor and I got this.

317
00:14:14,548 --> 00:14:15,854
You what?

318
00:14:28,737 --> 00:14:30,999
He's dead.

319
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,610
Something's not right.

320
00:14:37,571 --> 00:14:39,659
Don't move...

321
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,140
Or we all go boom.

322
00:14:42,968 --> 00:14:44,882
Frak!

323
00:14:44,883 --> 00:14:46,319
JJ.

324
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:52,498
Oh, crap.

325
00:14:52,499 --> 00:14:54,892
Why did you do it, JJ?

326
00:14:54,893 --> 00:14:57,155
Why did you kill her?

327
00:14:57,156 --> 00:15:00,245
Damn it, JJ! Answer me!

328
00:15:00,246 --> 00:15:03,379
Who the hell is JJ?

329
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,641
Grant.

330
00:15:06,035 --> 00:15:07,949
Incoming.

331
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,778
Evac now!

332
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:18,585
Oh, great. Looks like we made it back

333
00:15:18,586 --> 00:15:20,353
just in time to walk into a bomb trap.

334
00:15:25,184 --> 00:15:27,490
- How'd you find us?
- Later. We have to move.

335
00:15:27,491 --> 00:15:29,361
Might be a bit of a problem.

336
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:31,886
Buy us a few seconds.

337
00:15:31,887 --> 00:15:33,452
On my mark.

338
00:15:33,453 --> 00:15:35,977
3... 2... 1...

339
00:15:38,023 --> 00:15:39,719
Go!

340
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:47,250
Well, at least we didn't die.

341
00:15:52,415 --> 00:15:54,590
It's a good thing we
were tracking the victim,

342
00:15:54,591 --> 00:15:56,461
or you would have been in
worse shape than that drive.

343
00:15:56,462 --> 00:15:57,854
At least it's still in one piece.

344
00:15:57,855 --> 00:15:59,493
Maybe I can recover the data.

345
00:15:59,494 --> 00:16:01,902
Maybe you can explain to all
of us what you were doing there

346
00:16:01,903 --> 00:16:04,039
- with no backup.
- We can take care of ourselves.

347
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,069
That's not the point, Mia.

348
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:06,707
What were you looking for?

349
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:09,453
In the future, that building is

350
00:16:09,454 --> 00:16:11,281
the Deathstroke home base.

351
00:16:11,282 --> 00:16:13,544
The leader's Grant Wilson.

352
00:16:13,545 --> 00:16:15,590
Slade's other son. Surprise, surprise.

353
00:16:15,591 --> 00:16:18,549
Were you ever planning on
sharing that information

354
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:20,160
with the rest of the class?

355
00:16:20,161 --> 00:16:23,511
- No.
- Clearly your daughter.

356
00:16:23,512 --> 00:16:25,165
So if you knew it was Grant,

357
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:27,167
then why did you call him JJ?

358
00:16:27,168 --> 00:16:29,343
I heard you yell his name.

359
00:16:29,344 --> 00:16:30,684
What's going on here?

360
00:16:30,685 --> 00:16:32,346
She doesn't know what
she's talking about.

361
00:16:32,347 --> 00:16:34,262
Then you tell me, Connor!

362
00:16:39,789 --> 00:16:41,746
We came back,

363
00:16:41,747 --> 00:16:44,140
so we thought maybe JJ did, too.

364
00:16:44,141 --> 00:16:46,055
That's why we didn't tell
you about the Deathstroke.

365
00:16:46,056 --> 00:16:48,014
Connor, I don't understand
what you're talking about.

366
00:16:48,015 --> 00:16:51,670
In the future, Grant
trains a new leader,

367
00:16:51,671 --> 00:16:54,630
someone who eventually
takes over the Deathstroke.

368
00:16:57,067 --> 00:16:58,459
It's JJ.

369
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,287
You told me JJ was fine!

370
00:17:00,288 --> 00:17:01,679
Dad, I'm sorry.

371
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,160
- There's something else.
- William.

372
00:17:04,161 --> 00:17:06,162
Look. They have a right to know,

373
00:17:06,163 --> 00:17:10,036
and I'm done holding onto this.

374
00:17:10,037 --> 00:17:12,690
Future Star City is a terrible place.

375
00:17:12,691 --> 00:17:15,824
It's run by gangs, the cops are corrupt,

376
00:17:15,825 --> 00:17:18,044
politicians, too.

377
00:17:18,045 --> 00:17:19,698
Does that include me?

378
00:17:21,323 --> 00:17:23,000
We were trying to save it,

379
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:24,678
but that meant stopping JJ,

380
00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:26,878
and that's what we were doing
right before we came here.

381
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,446
We... we thought we could, but...

382
00:17:31,145 --> 00:17:34,278
Zoe was with Mia, and...

383
00:17:36,237 --> 00:17:37,847
And what?

384
00:17:40,284 --> 00:17:41,807
JJ killed her.

385
00:17:44,245 --> 00:17:46,421
I'm so sorry, Rene.

386
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,995
Rene! Rene, stop, man. Let's talk!

387
00:17:55,996 --> 00:17:58,084
Talk about what, huh?

388
00:17:58,085 --> 00:17:59,563
About how your son killed my daughter?

389
00:17:59,564 --> 00:18:01,383
Look, man. I know you're angry, okay?

390
00:18:01,384 --> 00:18:03,418
I'm shook, too. My
son's a murderer, Rene,

391
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:05,439
a murderer,

392
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,875
but, man, now that we know what went on,

393
00:18:06,876 --> 00:18:08,311
maybe we can do something to change it.

394
00:18:08,312 --> 00:18:09,921
Change it how?

395
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,445
What if what we do today doesn't make

396
00:18:11,446 --> 00:18:13,491
a damn difference about tomorrow?

397
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,105
This is my fault.

398
00:18:19,984 --> 00:18:23,228
I'm sorry. I should
have told you sooner.

399
00:18:23,229 --> 00:18:26,733
Then tell me now, Connor!

400
00:18:26,734 --> 00:18:29,606
Everything.

401
00:18:29,607 --> 00:18:34,132
When you took me in, I was angry

402
00:18:34,133 --> 00:18:36,830
and rebellious,

403
00:18:36,831 --> 00:18:41,009
but you... you refused to give up on me.

404
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:44,360
Man, you straightened
me out, made me who I am,

405
00:18:44,361 --> 00:18:46,972
a soldier just like you...

406
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:54,413
But JJ, he resented it.

407
00:18:54,414 --> 00:18:57,112
You know, it was like
I had stole the love

408
00:18:57,113 --> 00:18:58,809
that should have been his.

409
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:01,116
Maybe if I had been a better son

410
00:19:01,117 --> 00:19:03,205
JJ would have never broken bad

411
00:19:03,206 --> 00:19:07,252
and Zoe would still be alive.

412
00:19:07,253 --> 00:19:09,602
Dad, please say something.

413
00:19:09,603 --> 00:19:11,778
Dad?

414
00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:16,031
Connor, since the moment you got here,

415
00:19:16,032 --> 00:19:19,047
you have done nothing but lie to me,

416
00:19:19,048 --> 00:19:21,658
to all of us.

417
00:19:21,659 --> 00:19:23,791
What do you want me to say?

418
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:31,130
Zoe was fighting to fix exactly
what her dad helped cause.

419
00:19:31,131 --> 00:19:33,191
That's why she was a
Canary like both of you.

420
00:19:33,192 --> 00:19:35,370
You guys had a whole
network of them in the City.

421
00:19:35,371 --> 00:19:37,413
And that's what Connor
was talking about earlier.

422
00:19:37,414 --> 00:19:39,589
And yet we still couldn't save the City.

423
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,156
After Rene walled off the Glades,

424
00:19:41,157 --> 00:19:42,940
the scope was just too big,

425
00:19:42,941 --> 00:19:44,231
and ever since the wall came down,

426
00:19:44,232 --> 00:19:45,365
we've been fighting the Deathstroke,

427
00:19:45,366 --> 00:19:47,151
trying to make things better, but...

428
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:49,525
I just still don't understand.

429
00:19:49,526 --> 00:19:52,941
I mean, JJ adores Zoe. How
could he do something like this?

430
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:54,604
Seemed pretty easy for him,

431
00:19:54,605 --> 00:19:57,603
so how about we stop
mourning poor, innocent JJ

432
00:19:57,604 --> 00:19:59,217
and accept who he actually is?

433
00:19:59,218 --> 00:20:02,481
Look. All that matters right
now is stopping Grant Wilson

434
00:20:02,482 --> 00:20:05,354
before he screws up everyone's future.

435
00:20:05,355 --> 00:20:07,950
What else can you tell me about him?

436
00:20:07,951 --> 00:20:09,532
Just the broad strokes.

437
00:20:09,533 --> 00:20:11,128
Grant made a name for himself doing

438
00:20:11,129 --> 00:20:12,834
pretty much exactly what he's doing now,

439
00:20:12,835 --> 00:20:14,077
targeting the rich,

440
00:20:14,078 --> 00:20:15,916
appealing to the disenfranchised.

441
00:20:15,917 --> 00:20:17,056
They became cult heroes,

442
00:20:17,057 --> 00:20:18,883
which is how he seduced JJ.

443
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,189
Any more specifics?

444
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,802
Grant's home base just got blown up.

445
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:23,741
That... that never happened before.

446
00:20:23,742 --> 00:20:25,941
We're in new territory now.

447
00:20:25,942 --> 00:20:28,315
How long to access the drive?

448
00:20:28,316 --> 00:20:32,419
Uh, more than a few, less than a year.

449
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,378
I'm gonna go check on Rene.

450
00:20:37,512 --> 00:20:39,948
We should be out there doing something.

451
00:20:39,949 --> 00:20:42,308
We will be once we know

452
00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:44,137
Grant Wilson's plan.

453
00:20:48,871 --> 00:20:52,916
Are you crazy? How can
you not like mint chip?

454
00:20:52,917 --> 00:20:54,963
It tastes like toothpaste.

455
00:20:54,964 --> 00:20:57,748
Aunt Dinah? I didn't know
you were gonna be here.

456
00:20:57,749 --> 00:21:01,014
Hey, kiddo. Give me a squeeze.

457
00:21:04,234 --> 00:21:05,669
You want to talk to my dad, huh?

458
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:07,323
- I'll go start scooping.
- Hey, hey.

459
00:21:07,324 --> 00:21:09,326
Don't eat all the ice cream.

460
00:21:25,342 --> 00:21:27,300
How am I supposed to
wake up every morning

461
00:21:27,301 --> 00:21:29,999
knowing how many days
we have left together?

462
00:21:31,522 --> 00:21:35,134
By trying to change what happens,

463
00:21:35,135 --> 00:21:37,789
trying every single day.

464
00:21:43,506 --> 00:21:47,577
We should talk. What are you doing?

465
00:21:47,578 --> 00:21:49,535
I'm going to the hospital bomb site.

466
00:21:49,536 --> 00:21:51,102
Maybe Dinah missed something.

467
00:21:51,103 --> 00:21:54,264
- Mia.
- I'm not gonna stand around and waste time.

468
00:21:54,265 --> 00:21:56,412
Look. I know what's
driving you right now.

469
00:21:56,413 --> 00:21:57,671
You lost a teammate.

470
00:21:57,672 --> 00:21:59,458
I... I... I've been there.

471
00:21:59,459 --> 00:22:01,330
I... I can help. I'm here to help.

472
00:22:01,331 --> 00:22:03,636
You know, I survived my
whole life without you.

473
00:22:03,637 --> 00:22:05,377
I don't need you to play Dad now.

474
00:22:05,378 --> 00:22:07,553
Hey. I'm not playing Dad.
I am simply telling you

475
00:22:07,554 --> 00:22:09,338
that it is not tactically
wise to go out there

476
00:22:09,339 --> 00:22:10,643
by yourself...

477
00:22:10,644 --> 00:22:11,673
Fine. I'll take Laurel.

478
00:22:11,674 --> 00:22:13,264
When you are letting your decisions

479
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:15,159
be driven by your emotions.

480
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,346
Trust me. I've been there.

481
00:22:17,347 --> 00:22:18,651
You don't get a say.

482
00:22:18,652 --> 00:22:20,302
You gave up that right when you left

483
00:22:20,303 --> 00:22:23,700
me and Mom alone in that cabin.

484
00:22:23,701 --> 00:22:25,441
How could you just abandon us?

485
00:22:25,442 --> 00:22:27,309
Because I chose to keep
you safe, and I chose right.

486
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:29,314
You just wanted to be a hero,

487
00:22:29,315 --> 00:22:33,318
so you put your mission
above your family.

488
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:37,627
Don't worry. You'll learn to
live without me pretty easy

489
00:22:37,628 --> 00:22:39,411
just like I learned to live without you.

490
00:22:39,412 --> 00:22:42,022
Ahem.

491
00:22:42,023 --> 00:22:44,503
I'm not letting you go out there.

492
00:22:44,504 --> 00:22:47,593
Nyssa Al Ghul trained me.

493
00:22:47,594 --> 00:22:48,942
You want to see how well?

494
00:22:48,943 --> 00:22:50,596
I'm not gonna fight
you. I'm your father.

495
00:22:50,597 --> 00:22:52,974
Really? Because from where I stand,

496
00:22:52,975 --> 00:22:54,645
you're just some guy in my way.

497
00:22:56,603 --> 00:22:58,301
Mia...

498
00:23:00,477 --> 00:23:02,392
I'll go with you.

499
00:23:08,354 --> 00:23:09,660
Let's go.

500
00:23:15,796 --> 00:23:18,885
Uh... Dad, I know this is bad timing,

501
00:23:18,886 --> 00:23:20,496
but you should see this.

502
00:23:20,497 --> 00:23:21,846
It's live.

503
00:23:24,196 --> 00:23:28,112
6 years ago, my father
rained terror down on this City.

504
00:23:28,113 --> 00:23:30,810
He was short-sighted, foolish.

505
00:23:30,811 --> 00:23:32,812
This City has a cancer,

506
00:23:32,813 --> 00:23:35,467
the 1% who control industry.

507
00:23:35,468 --> 00:23:37,991
I will excise it.

508
00:23:37,992 --> 00:23:41,691
Our siege of Star City begins tonight.

509
00:23:41,692 --> 00:23:44,607
This might be how it starts.

510
00:23:44,608 --> 00:23:46,871
This is the beginning of the future.

511
00:23:47,518 --> 00:23:49,557
Why would Grant give us advance warning?

512
00:23:49,558 --> 00:23:50,820
It seems too easy.

513
00:23:51,807 --> 00:23:53,544
That's because it is.

514
00:23:53,545 --> 00:23:55,179
Look. Grant may be planning an attack,

515
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:57,311
but it won't be on the rich.

516
00:23:57,312 --> 00:23:58,834
That video's a mislead.

517
00:23:58,835 --> 00:24:02,186
This kind of deception
is a Deathstroke special.

518
00:24:02,187 --> 00:24:03,572
How do you know that?

519
00:24:03,573 --> 00:24:05,450
I was undercover with them for a while,

520
00:24:05,451 --> 00:24:08,192
a last-ditch attempt
to get through to JJ.

521
00:24:08,193 --> 00:24:11,499
Okay. So if this is a bait and
switch, what's the switch?

522
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,979
What do you think Grant's planning.

523
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,720
Something a whole lot bigger.

524
00:24:14,721 --> 00:24:16,678
I just don't know what exactly.

525
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:19,052
Everything happening
with the Deathstroke

526
00:24:19,053 --> 00:24:20,342
is different now.

527
00:24:20,343 --> 00:24:22,162
Well, I've got some good news.

528
00:24:22,163 --> 00:24:24,208
I managed to extract
the data from the drive,

529
00:24:24,209 --> 00:24:25,999
but, surprise, surprise, it's encrypted,

530
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,262
and since I'm not an expert

531
00:24:27,263 --> 00:24:29,391
in early 21st-century
decryption algorithms,

532
00:24:29,392 --> 00:24:32,263
I've called in someone who is... Curtis.

533
00:24:32,264 --> 00:24:34,222
Great. Now what about Mia and Laurel?

534
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:36,180
We need to focus on tracking down Grant.

535
00:24:36,181 --> 00:24:39,227
Felicity's search algorithm
should still be on the computer.

536
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:40,663
Way ahead of you.

537
00:24:40,664 --> 00:24:42,609
Wow. Mom really liked
playing fast and loose

538
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:44,536
with the Fourth Amendment, huh?

539
00:24:44,537 --> 00:24:46,625
Yeah.

540
00:24:46,626 --> 00:24:48,627
Any chatter from A.R.G.U.S.?

541
00:24:48,628 --> 00:24:51,196
No. No, no, no. They said
they'll keep us posted.

542
00:24:53,459 --> 00:24:55,634
Hey. I spoke to Rene, by the way.

543
00:24:55,635 --> 00:24:58,289
Well, I'm quite sure he's
not willing to talk to me.

544
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:01,859
No, but I do know someone who is.

545
00:25:10,085 --> 00:25:12,695
Are you avoiding him?

546
00:25:12,696 --> 00:25:13,958
No.

547
00:25:22,662 --> 00:25:24,055
Maybe.

548
00:25:26,753 --> 00:25:29,103
I've never dealt with
anything like this before.

549
00:25:29,104 --> 00:25:31,279
My head is still spinning.

550
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,326
I... I... I want to blame someone.
I just don't know who.

551
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:39,374
John, we all failed to save this City.

552
00:25:39,375 --> 00:25:42,159
Yeah, Dinah, but I'm his father,

553
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,813
so it's on me.

554
00:25:43,814 --> 00:25:46,034
So you did pick who to blame.

555
00:25:49,385 --> 00:25:53,394
All this talk about JJ got me

556
00:25:53,395 --> 00:25:56,347
thinking about Andy, how I failed him,

557
00:25:56,348 --> 00:26:01,267
so yeah, the blame is definitely on me.

558
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:03,311
I'm gonna tell you the
same thing I told Rene

559
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:07,315
because it's the same thing
I've been telling myself.

560
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:09,404
Knowing what's happened

561
00:26:09,405 --> 00:26:14,235
can either destroy us or save us.

562
00:26:14,236 --> 00:26:16,585
We've seen our worst.

563
00:26:16,586 --> 00:26:19,154
Now let's be our best.

564
00:26:23,419 --> 00:26:25,376
In the future, do they still use

565
00:26:25,377 --> 00:26:27,770
the phrase "wild goose chase"?

566
00:26:27,771 --> 00:26:29,206
If you're bored, you can go.

567
00:26:29,207 --> 00:26:30,642
I don't need a babysitter.

568
00:26:30,643 --> 00:26:33,210
No, but you might need backup

569
00:26:33,211 --> 00:26:35,648
when you try and kill Grant Wilson.

570
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:39,869
How did you know?

571
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:43,164
Oh. Well, clearly no
one has informed you

572
00:26:43,165 --> 00:26:45,222
that I used to play for team villain,

573
00:26:45,223 --> 00:26:49,183
and I can spot a murderous
intent a million miles away.

574
00:26:49,184 --> 00:26:51,620
So what, are you gonna try
and talk me out of it now,

575
00:26:51,621 --> 00:26:53,404
tell me to listen to my dad or...

576
00:26:53,405 --> 00:26:58,279
Oh, God, no. I would never tell
any one to listen to Oliver Queen.

577
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,889
No offense,

578
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:04,196
but I'm not exactly a very
big fan of your father's.

579
00:27:04,197 --> 00:27:07,824
He's kind of a dick, but
you are a grown woman,

580
00:27:07,825 --> 00:27:12,206
and if you want to kill
this guy, then have at it,

581
00:27:12,207 --> 00:27:14,425
but I just want to know why.

582
00:27:14,426 --> 00:27:17,341
Because locking him up
isn't gonna change anything.

583
00:27:17,342 --> 00:27:19,965
He escapes every time.

584
00:27:19,966 --> 00:27:22,407
It's why he is such a cult hero

585
00:27:22,408 --> 00:27:24,232
among all the worst here in Star City.

586
00:27:24,233 --> 00:27:27,627
- Including future JJ.
- Exactly.

587
00:27:27,628 --> 00:27:30,760
Look. Grant has to die so Zoe can live.

588
00:27:30,761 --> 00:27:32,806
I don't know anything
about changing timelines,

589
00:27:32,807 --> 00:27:36,026
but I am something of
an expert on vengeance,

590
00:27:36,027 --> 00:27:39,386
and getting it, it doesn't do anything

591
00:27:39,387 --> 00:27:41,412
but cause you more pain.

592
00:27:41,413 --> 00:27:43,830
So, what, you're an expert on
talking people out of murder?

593
00:27:43,831 --> 00:27:45,508
Kind of.

594
00:27:45,509 --> 00:27:50,101
I had to when Felicity wanted
to take down Ricardo Diaz.

595
00:27:50,102 --> 00:27:51,825
My mom tried to kill someone?

596
00:27:51,826 --> 00:27:54,610
No, because I talked her out of it.

597
00:27:54,611 --> 00:27:55,698
And, look, I get it.

598
00:27:55,699 --> 00:27:57,598
You and your mom, you're both women

599
00:27:57,599 --> 00:27:59,746
who won't allow themselves
to be talked out of anything,

600
00:27:59,747 --> 00:28:02,618
and I appreciate that,

601
00:28:02,619 --> 00:28:07,734
but Felicity, she never
regretted changing her approach,

602
00:28:08,669 --> 00:28:12,150
so maybe you should try
doing things differently, too.

603
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:27,152
There you are.

604
00:28:27,153 --> 00:28:28,807
Mia's back.

605
00:28:30,778 --> 00:28:32,169
You crack the drive?

606
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:33,504
Curtis almost has it.

607
00:28:33,505 --> 00:28:35,956
God, you know, it's kind
of annoying how good he is.

608
00:28:35,957 --> 00:28:40,613
Plus he's got this perfect husband/life,

609
00:28:40,614 --> 00:28:43,791
not that I'm jealous or anything.

610
00:28:45,836 --> 00:28:49,230
Let me know when it's done, okay?

611
00:28:49,231 --> 00:28:52,374
You know, I have been told
by several ex-boyfriends

612
00:28:52,375 --> 00:28:55,062
that I do this moody, broody thing

613
00:28:55,063 --> 00:28:57,475
when I'm problem-solving.

614
00:28:57,476 --> 00:29:00,023
Guess it must be genetic.

615
00:29:00,024 --> 00:29:01,397
It's Mia, right?

616
00:29:01,398 --> 00:29:03,597
I didn't want her to go out there.

617
00:29:03,598 --> 00:29:05,405
Well, then you should
have made her stay?

618
00:29:05,406 --> 00:29:07,683
What, put her in timeout?
She's an adult.

619
00:29:07,684 --> 00:29:09,642
Yeah, and like an adult,
she makes mistakes.

620
00:29:09,643 --> 00:29:11,948
Look. She's right.

621
00:29:11,949 --> 00:29:14,951
I chose to go with the Monitor.

622
00:29:14,952 --> 00:29:17,824
I abandoned her.

623
00:29:17,825 --> 00:29:19,068
I haven't earned a say.

624
00:29:19,069 --> 00:29:22,175
Yeah, but that doesn't mean
she doesn't want you to have one

625
00:29:22,176 --> 00:29:25,179
or... or that you shouldn't,

626
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:29,009
and I'm saying that from experience.

627
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:30,205
You have kids in the future?

628
00:29:30,206 --> 00:29:32,403
Oh, God, no. I mean, don't get me wrong.

629
00:29:32,404 --> 00:29:34,667
Kids are a miracle or... whatever,

630
00:29:34,668 --> 00:29:37,104
but I was actually referring to

631
00:29:37,105 --> 00:29:40,194
when I left you to go live
with grandma and grandpa.

632
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:42,762
Yeah. That one's still
pretty fresh for me.

633
00:29:42,763 --> 00:29:45,852
- Right.
- I mean... I... I...

634
00:29:45,853 --> 00:29:47,897
I thought you hated my guts.

635
00:29:47,898 --> 00:29:49,899
I hated you for abandoning me.

636
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,771
- I tried.
- True,

637
00:29:51,772 --> 00:29:54,904
but I wanted you to try harder,

638
00:29:54,905 --> 00:29:57,037
push a little more.

639
00:29:57,038 --> 00:29:59,954
I think that's all any child
wants from their parents.

640
00:30:04,332 --> 00:30:06,575
I'm sorry.

641
00:30:06,576 --> 00:30:09,515
It's okay.

642
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:12,759
Dad, I am glad that you're in my life

643
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,441
then and now,

644
00:30:17,711 --> 00:30:19,626
and Mia will be, too.

645
00:30:23,064 --> 00:30:25,543
Um, I hate to interrupt Father-Son time,

646
00:30:25,544 --> 00:30:27,807
but we got something.

647
00:30:27,808 --> 00:30:30,331
So Grant is trying to one-up his father.

648
00:30:30,332 --> 00:30:32,202
The Siege version 2.0 is tonight,

649
00:30:32,203 --> 00:30:33,813
and this time, Mirakuru is out,

650
00:30:33,814 --> 00:30:35,771
and coordinated bomb attacks are in.

651
00:30:35,772 --> 00:30:37,730
- How many?
- Lots,

652
00:30:37,731 --> 00:30:40,950
and Grant has them all
connected to a remote detonator,

653
00:30:40,951 --> 00:30:42,256
probably a phone.

654
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,935
The good news is... and I use that term

655
00:30:43,936 --> 00:30:45,218
very loosely...

656
00:30:45,219 --> 00:30:48,074
is that he set up a relay
device underneath downtown.

657
00:30:48,075 --> 00:30:50,960
So we disable the relay
device, we turn off the bomb.

658
00:30:50,961 --> 00:30:52,309
Okay. What about Grant?

659
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:53,789
He's holed up underground,

660
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:55,791
where the lines
converge at water street.

661
00:30:55,792 --> 00:30:56,923
History repeats itself.

662
00:30:56,924 --> 00:30:58,402
Well, maybe we can stop the attack

663
00:30:58,403 --> 00:31:00,361
by running the same
play we ran last time.

664
00:31:00,362 --> 00:31:03,555
No. Someone told me the only way

665
00:31:03,556 --> 00:31:07,498
to change the future is to start
doing things differently now.

666
00:31:07,499 --> 00:31:10,153
- Rene, look...
- John, we're good.

667
00:31:10,154 --> 00:31:11,764
You, too, Connor.

668
00:31:11,765 --> 00:31:13,200
I can't be mad at either
of you for something

669
00:31:13,201 --> 00:31:15,404
I will never let happen.

670
00:31:16,366 --> 00:31:19,001
All right. We set up
one team to go after Grant,

671
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:20,500
one team to destroy the relay device,

672
00:31:20,501 --> 00:31:23,776
but we also need to keep
the public calm this time.

673
00:31:23,777 --> 00:31:25,595
Last I checked, the
police are still good,

674
00:31:25,596 --> 00:31:27,780
and I'm still Captain, future be damned.

675
00:31:27,781 --> 00:31:29,667
I'll join you. I got to do something

676
00:31:29,668 --> 00:31:31,348
for the Glades from there.

677
00:31:31,349 --> 00:31:33,220
- What about the three of us?
- William, I think it would be

678
00:31:33,221 --> 00:31:35,178
best if you stayed and helped Curtis.

679
00:31:35,179 --> 00:31:37,833
Mia and Connor, I'd like for
the two of you to come with us.

680
00:31:37,834 --> 00:31:40,575
Rene said it. We have to do
things differently this time.

681
00:31:40,576 --> 00:31:42,795
Agreed?

682
00:31:42,796 --> 00:31:44,013
All right.

683
00:31:44,014 --> 00:31:45,798
This is my favorite part.

684
00:31:45,799 --> 00:31:46,842
Suit up.

685
00:31:46,843 --> 00:31:48,279
Yes!

686
00:31:53,329 --> 00:31:56,505
- Stay close, please.
- Where are we?

687
00:31:56,506 --> 00:31:58,376
You're in the service tunnels
underneath the City.

688
00:31:58,377 --> 00:32:00,553
Basically, you all are in
"The Shawshank redemption".

689
00:32:00,554 --> 00:32:02,396
"The Shawshank" what?

690
00:32:02,397 --> 00:32:04,905
"The Shawshank Redemption". It's...
are there no movies in the future?

691
00:32:04,906 --> 00:32:06,771
- Curtis!
- Oh, right. Staying on task.

692
00:32:06,772 --> 00:32:08,323
Sorry. I'm a little bit
out of practice, guys.

693
00:32:08,324 --> 00:32:10,436
Spartan, what's your status?

694
00:32:10,437 --> 00:32:12,114
We're at the east end.

695
00:32:12,115 --> 00:32:13,986
Looks like someone beat us here.

696
00:32:16,029 --> 00:32:18,576
Tonight, we take back this City

697
00:32:18,577 --> 00:32:21,385
from the cancer which has plagued it.

698
00:32:21,386 --> 00:32:24,282
We will set its citizens free.

699
00:32:24,283 --> 00:32:27,091
We will save this City from itself.

700
00:32:27,092 --> 00:32:31,075
Stand beside me. Take back
what is rightfully yours.

701
00:32:31,076 --> 00:32:34,494
Let's make Star City great again.

702
00:32:34,495 --> 00:32:36,346
Where are his men?

703
00:32:36,347 --> 00:32:38,349
Mia, you should get behind me.

704
00:32:42,639 --> 00:32:44,074
I need 3 units at the docks

705
00:32:44,075 --> 00:32:45,598
and another 2 in Pennytown, okay?

706
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:47,730
- Hey.
- Yo. Hey.

707
00:32:47,731 --> 00:32:48,950
What's up?

708
00:32:48,951 --> 00:32:51,051
Got a press conference in
the Glades in the works.

709
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,555
Great.

710
00:32:52,556 --> 00:32:54,694
Brought you a new
addition to the drunk tank.

711
00:32:54,695 --> 00:32:56,523
Watch him for a sec?

712
00:32:58,346 --> 00:33:00,826
Hey. You got the time?

713
00:33:03,312 --> 00:33:05,140
It's 5 to 9:00.

714
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:13,540
What the hell is that?

715
00:33:20,808 --> 00:33:22,461
Bomb!

716
00:33:24,725 --> 00:33:26,814
We're almost at the relay.

717
00:33:33,647 --> 00:33:35,387
Well, that can't be good.

718
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:45,527
Mia! Ohh!

719
00:33:45,528 --> 00:33:48,661
Raise your hand if you
know how to disarm a bomb.

720
00:33:48,662 --> 00:33:51,664
William, it's an intervalometer.

721
00:33:51,665 --> 00:33:54,667
Where'd you learn that?

722
00:33:54,668 --> 00:33:55,753
From you.

723
00:33:55,754 --> 00:33:56,900
It's most likely pulsating

724
00:33:56,901 --> 00:33:58,404
in a consistently synchronized pattern.

725
00:33:58,405 --> 00:33:59,879
So it will have a
transfer switch embedded

726
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,204
into the mainframe.

727
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:03,120
Look at us... Holt and Smoak 2.0.

728
00:34:28,658 --> 00:34:30,441
There should be two wires
plugged into the console.

729
00:34:30,442 --> 00:34:31,747
You're gonna disconnect the red one.

730
00:34:31,748 --> 00:34:33,256
Do not touch the blue one,

731
00:34:33,257 --> 00:34:35,447
or else very bad things will happen.

732
00:34:39,713 --> 00:34:41,975
Unh!

733
00:34:41,976 --> 00:34:45,718
What the hell?!

734
00:34:50,462 --> 00:34:52,421
The device has been neutralized.

735
00:34:57,339 --> 00:34:59,775
I guess things have never not
been tense around here, huh?

736
00:34:59,776 --> 00:35:01,908
Yeah. I like to cope by stress eating.

737
00:35:01,909 --> 00:35:04,215
- Gummy bear?
- Thanks.

738
00:35:06,565 --> 00:35:08,175
This isn't over.

739
00:35:08,176 --> 00:35:10,178
- Yes, it is.
- Mia!

740
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,964
Get out of my way.

741
00:35:14,965 --> 00:35:17,880
No.

742
00:35:17,881 --> 00:35:21,144
Hate me if you want.

743
00:35:21,145 --> 00:35:23,539
I'm not letting you do this.

744
00:35:33,148 --> 00:35:35,062
Just got off the phone
with Gotham City PD.

745
00:35:35,063 --> 00:35:37,420
Grant Wilson is being prepped
and transferred to Blackgate,

746
00:35:37,421 --> 00:35:39,161
where he will spend the next 20 to life.

747
00:35:39,162 --> 00:35:42,816
We will keep an eye on him.
He's not going anywhere.

748
00:35:42,817 --> 00:35:44,766
Takes the Deathstroke off the board

749
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:46,086
for the foreseeable future.

750
00:35:46,087 --> 00:35:48,518
Literally. Let's hope it
changes things somehow.

751
00:35:48,519 --> 00:35:52,522
- For Zoe.
- And for JJ.

752
00:35:52,523 --> 00:35:55,220
Here's hoping.

753
00:35:55,221 --> 00:35:57,180
Or we make our own hope.

754
00:36:01,914 --> 00:36:04,070
You guys really held your own tonight.

755
00:36:04,071 --> 00:36:08,054
Well, my keyboard
warrior skills are strong.

756
00:36:08,055 --> 00:36:10,548
Uh, you know, Curtis when right
back to analyzing that fabric,

757
00:36:10,549 --> 00:36:12,411
so I'm just gonna go
see if he needs help.

758
00:36:12,412 --> 00:36:13,761
Thank you, William.

759
00:36:18,897 --> 00:36:21,594
You okay?

760
00:36:21,595 --> 00:36:25,163
- I would have killed him.
- I know,

761
00:36:25,164 --> 00:36:27,340
and I know you didn't want to.

762
00:36:30,213 --> 00:36:31,736
Thank you.

763
00:36:33,433 --> 00:36:34,695
Come on.

764
00:36:38,351 --> 00:36:41,135
Hey.

765
00:36:43,574 --> 00:36:46,271
You ready to go home?

766
00:36:46,272 --> 00:36:48,621
You don't have to do that.

767
00:36:48,622 --> 00:36:51,017
I don't want to be a
reminder of everything bad

768
00:36:51,018 --> 00:36:53,630
that happened to JJ and to your family.

769
00:36:53,631 --> 00:36:55,590
Connor.

770
00:37:00,852 --> 00:37:04,377
You are my family, son.

771
00:37:06,379 --> 00:37:08,946
Look. I'm sorry, Dad.

772
00:37:08,947 --> 00:37:11,862
- I... I really am. I...
- It's okay.

773
00:37:11,863 --> 00:37:14,517
It's okay. I'm sorry, too.

774
00:37:14,518 --> 00:37:16,128
We're gonna figure this out.

775
00:37:18,696 --> 00:37:20,740
Are you still
giving that speech tomorrow?

776
00:37:20,741 --> 00:37:24,918
Yes. You really think we changed
things tonight in the future?

777
00:37:24,919 --> 00:37:27,356
You mean in like
a baby Hitler kind of way,

778
00:37:27,357 --> 00:37:29,401
butterfly effect?

779
00:37:29,402 --> 00:37:31,512
- Come on.
- Hey. If you want me to

780
00:37:31,513 --> 00:37:32,911
stop training Zoe, I will.

781
00:37:32,912 --> 00:37:34,754
Nah. I can't keep her in a bubble

782
00:37:34,755 --> 00:37:36,989
just like you can't stop being a cop

783
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:39,411
and I can't stop running for office.

784
00:37:39,412 --> 00:37:40,804
So don't.

785
00:37:40,805 --> 00:37:44,111
Not all of the future was bad, right?

786
00:37:44,112 --> 00:37:46,200
Just do the good stuff.

787
00:37:46,201 --> 00:37:49,160
I mean, the Canary
network's not a bad idea.

788
00:37:49,161 --> 00:37:51,205
Could be useful.

789
00:37:51,206 --> 00:37:54,384
Then why wait for a future
we can start making now?

790
00:37:59,737 --> 00:38:02,129
So this is what you wanted to show me,

791
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:05,045
Grandpa's grave?

792
00:38:05,046 --> 00:38:06,612
Did your mother ever mention him?

793
00:38:06,613 --> 00:38:08,832
Not really.

794
00:38:08,833 --> 00:38:11,182
I suppose she wouldn't know what to say.

795
00:38:11,183 --> 00:38:13,402
I barely do.

796
00:38:13,403 --> 00:38:14,881
You weren't close?

797
00:38:14,882 --> 00:38:16,883
I didn't really get to know the real him

798
00:38:16,884 --> 00:38:18,614
until after he died, and, uh...

799
00:38:21,454 --> 00:38:23,369
Look. I don't want that to be us.

800
00:38:25,893 --> 00:38:31,507
You've, um... you've lost people, right?

801
00:38:31,508 --> 00:38:33,292
Yeah. Too many.

802
00:38:35,338 --> 00:38:37,340
Does the guilt ever leave?

803
00:38:39,472 --> 00:38:42,735
No.

804
00:38:42,736 --> 00:38:44,577
You can learn to live with it.

805
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:48,567
I can help you with that, Mia,

806
00:38:48,568 --> 00:38:51,385
if you'd like.

807
00:39:01,494 --> 00:39:04,496
I've been a part of
the Glades my whole life.

808
00:39:04,497 --> 00:39:07,456
Born and raised,

809
00:39:07,457 --> 00:39:10,807
and if you're from here,

810
00:39:10,808 --> 00:39:14,941
you know we've been counted out a lot.

811
00:39:14,942 --> 00:39:17,596
We've been told we're low-income,

812
00:39:17,597 --> 00:39:19,555
we're uneducated,

813
00:39:19,556 --> 00:39:21,513
we're a lost cause.

814
00:39:22,994 --> 00:39:26,344
And if you hear that enough times,

815
00:39:26,345 --> 00:39:30,305
all you can do is hope that
things will get better later.

816
00:39:32,003 --> 00:39:33,743
Now, I don't know about you guys,

817
00:39:33,744 --> 00:39:37,269
but I'm tired of waiting.

818
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:46,374
I'm tired of waiting
for the day when people

819
00:39:46,375 --> 00:39:47,779
stop being afraid of the Glades

820
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:51,413
and start coming here
to raise their families,

821
00:39:51,414 --> 00:39:54,894
to find opportunities
for growth and change,

822
00:39:54,895 --> 00:39:57,520
to uplift our brothers
and sisters to be better

823
00:39:57,521 --> 00:40:00,509
than we ever were before.

824
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:03,468
If we keep waiting,

825
00:40:03,469 --> 00:40:05,514
we might run out of time.

826
00:40:05,515 --> 00:40:08,255
That's why from here on out,

827
00:40:08,256 --> 00:40:11,520
we don't wait for our
future in the Glades.

828
00:40:11,521 --> 00:40:15,611
We make our future now.

829
00:40:15,612 --> 00:40:18,222
Special delivery.

830
00:40:18,223 --> 00:40:22,705
Ohh! Okay. This is the best
late-night snack you can ever have.

831
00:40:22,706 --> 00:40:24,447
Want one?

832
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,580
Why not?

833
00:40:33,499 --> 00:40:34,978
Yes, Curtis.

834
00:40:34,979 --> 00:40:37,527
Do you want the long
version or the short version?

835
00:40:37,528 --> 00:40:39,428
Please say the long one because
I would love to geek out

836
00:40:39,429 --> 00:40:41,332
- on this science. Did you know that...
- Curtis.

837
00:40:41,333 --> 00:40:44,129
Short it is. Whatever it is
it is possible to replicate,

838
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:46,250
but there's a catch... a
couple catches, actually.

839
00:40:46,251 --> 00:40:49,122
- Okay.
- One... I don't have the tools to do it.

840
00:40:49,123 --> 00:40:51,466
Two... it is superillegal

841
00:40:51,467 --> 00:40:52,691
because it requires plutonium,

842
00:40:52,692 --> 00:40:54,345
you know, the bomb-making kind.

843
00:40:54,346 --> 00:40:56,739
Luckily, there's a
guy, a military general.

844
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:58,349
Okay. Where is he?

845
00:40:58,350 --> 00:40:59,786
Russia.

846
00:41:14,627 --> 00:41:16,628
You must be the Monitor.

847
00:41:16,629 --> 00:41:17,934
How do you know?

848
00:41:17,935 --> 00:41:19,836
Because no human would actually wear

849
00:41:19,837 --> 00:41:21,677
something so ridiculous.

850
00:41:21,678 --> 00:41:24,201
You ache for the world you lost,

851
00:41:24,202 --> 00:41:27,334
and I possess the power to restore it.

852
00:41:27,335 --> 00:41:28,727
You can bring back my Earth.

853
00:41:28,728 --> 00:41:30,599
The recovery of your universe

854
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,124
will require a single task.

855
00:41:34,429 --> 00:41:36,866
What kind of task?

856
00:41:36,867 --> 00:41:39,870
You must betray Oliver Queen.

857
