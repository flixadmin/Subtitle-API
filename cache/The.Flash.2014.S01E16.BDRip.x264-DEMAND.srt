1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,643
My name is Barry Allen
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,805
When I was a child, I saw my mother killed
by something impossible.

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,406
My father went to prison for her murder.

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,567
Then an accident
made me the impossible.

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,805
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist...

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,170
...but secretly, I use my speed to
fight crime and find others like me.

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,201
And one day, I'll find who killed my mother
and get justice for my father.

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,203
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,571
Previously on The Flash:

10
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,764
Last night, on my way
to the morgue, I saw something.

11
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,602
Taxi! Oh, come on, I'm gonna be late.

12
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,889
Simon Stagg, remember him?
Hasn't been seen in like six months.

13
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,963
You're saying Wells knows where Stagg is?

14
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,444
No, Wells killed him. I have evidence in a secure
digital file that will explain everything.

15
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,650
There is a tsunami heading for the city.
You need to get as far away as possible.

16
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,041
I have not been able
to stop thinking about you.

17
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,365
Go.

19
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,925
Taxi, taxi!

20
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,321
Oh, come on, I'm going to be late!

21
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,211
Oh, boy.

22
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,283
Hey, what's going on?

23
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,566
- Dude!
- Yeah.

24
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,041
Cisco, I'm here.

25
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,362
What happened? Why'd you stop?

26
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,327
I just got a little disoriented.

27
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,165
You need to make up some time, man.
You'd better hurry up.

28
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:57,086
- Hurry? What are...?
- Hurry, as in, get to the morgue.

29
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,050
The morgue?

30
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,851
But I was there yesterday.

31
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,047
What are you talking about?
Come on, you gotta go.

32
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,406
Hey, Barr, what's with all the water?

33
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,608
Did the sprinkler system go off
or something?

34
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,651
What? No, I checked the sprinklers.
They're all intact.

35
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,207
But the water has ice in it.

36
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:43,003
And the bruises on the coroner aren't just
on his face. Check. Look at his torso.

37
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,605
Whoa.

38
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,804
- How the hell did you know that?
- He was killed by hail.

39
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,761
- We have to listen to the recording.
- Recording?

40
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,251
Joe, we got something.

41
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,604
The coroner's office just installed an
automated dictation system. Listen to this.

42
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,207
- Please, no more.
- I'll stop when you tell me.

43
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,771
- Stop.
- Who killed him?

44
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,527
That's Mark Mardon. He wants revenge.

45
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,851
- And I really don't want to go.
- He's your brother.

46
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,368
- Not by choice.
- Okay, well, how bad can a birthday party be?

47
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,000
Um, my folks think Dante's
stink don't stink.

48
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,687
Doesn't matter how much he screws up
or how many times he gets in trouble...

49
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,683
...in their eyes, he can do no wrong.

50
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,926
And yet they never fail to remind me
that I can do no right.

51
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,320
What if I came with you?

52
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,767
What? Seriously?

53
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,481
Absolutely. You've done so much for me.
Let me be there for you for a change.

54
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,722
And I can look at old
family photo albums...

55
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,645
...and see what little Cisco looks like
without long hair.

56
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,487
I'm rescinding your invite.

57
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,044
Clyde Mardon has a brother?

58
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,646
So both Mardon brothers
survive the plane crash...

59
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,168
...and the dark matter released
by the particle accelerator explosion...

60
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,085
...affects them in the same way.
Virtually the same way.

61
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,366
That's right.

62
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:06,323
Only Mark's not like Clyde at all. He can
do things that you couldn't even imagine.

63
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,848
- You mean he's sort of like a weather wizard?
- Weather wizard?

64
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,604
Yeah.

65
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,722
- Trigeminal headache?
- Trigeminal headache?

66
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,170
Mister Allen.

67
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,120
A word, please.

68
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,925
Yeah.

69
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,407
You ruptured the time continuum,
didn't you?

70
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,483
You're experiencing temporal reversion.

71
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,165
- Yeah.
- How long?

72
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,369
A day and some change.
It's like I'm living it all over again.

73
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,603
Good. That means there's not too much
you could've messed up yet.

74
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,285
How did this happen?

75
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,284
I don't know. I mean I was running
faster than I've ever ran.

76
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,364
The first time I lived this day,
some horrible things happened.

77
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,841
- There was a tidal wave and...
- No. Do not tell me.

78
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,561
I do not wanna know anything
about the future you experienced. Nothing.

79
00:04:53,720 --> 00:05:00,729
- Okay, but, Doctor Wells...
- Barry, time is an extremely fragile construct.

80
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,009
Any deviation, no matter how small...

81
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,050
...could result in a cataclysm.
Here's what you're going to do.

82
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:13,521
Everything you did before, every word
you uttered, every step you took...

83
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,208
...you're going to do again. And you're not
going to tell anyone this happened.

84
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,446
Good day, Dr. Wells.

85
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,169
Time will tell, Gideon.

86
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,800
- Show me the future.
- As you wish.

87
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,648
The future remains intact, Dr. Wells.

88
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,370
If anything changes, alert me immediately.

89
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,642
Of course, doctor.

90
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,691
H9)'-

91
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:01,321
What is going on with you? How'd you
figure all that stuff out at the morgue?

92
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,528
Lucky guesses, I guess.

93
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,207
Look, I'm telling you, I'm gonna get Mardon
if it kills me.

94
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,131
Joe. Um...

95
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,205
I gotta run an errand.
I'll see you later, all right?

96
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,886
I didn't know there was
anyone else like me.

97
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,126
I'm gonna break out
and I'm gonna create a tidal wave...

98
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,169
...that destroys your entire city.

99
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,889
So I still don't understand.

100
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,883
How did you find him?

101
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,201
Uh, I just had a hunch.

102
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,362
That's gotta be some kind of record.

103
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,601
Heh. Yeah.

104
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:59,163
Well, there goes my excuse
for bailing on my brother's birthday.

105
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,448
Do you have any idea
what you've just done?

106
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,765
Yeah, I do.

107
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,606
- I just saved a lot of lives.
- I warned you not to mess with the timeline.

108
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,924
If you would let me tell you what was going
to happen, you'd understand why I did this.

109
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,687
Whatever tragedy
you think you've just averted...

110
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,684
...time will find a way to replace it
and trust me, Barry...

111
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,923
...the next one could be much worse.

112
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,369
- Don Santini, they're here.
- Move it.

113
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,088
Oh. Love the paneling. Mahogany?

114
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,527
So glad your house is made out of wood.

115
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:54,321
It's gonna be a pleasure watching it burn.

116
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,766
Refreshing.

117
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,400
What are you doing back in Central City,
Snafl?

118
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,450
- This is my city.
- Our city.

119
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,408
I told you if I ever saw you again,
I'd put the hurt on you.

120
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,971
You stir up trouble.

121
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,441
Trouble is bad for business.

122
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:15,846
It's time for you and your family to pack
up, leave town, retire to warmer climates.

123
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,241
And if we don't?

124
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,528
You will all freeze.

125
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,920
Or burn.

126
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,003
I heard about your guns.

127
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,969
Also heard that you lost them.

128
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,965
So tell me, Snart...

129
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:32,728
...what the hell are you and your pyro
friend gonna do without your fancy weapons?

130
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,245
This.

131
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:52,840
Now, that was fun. Fun, fun, fun.

132
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,047
Go.

133
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,921
Tell the rest of the Santini family
there's a new godfather.

134
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,970
And his name is Cold.

135
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,011
Wow. Your parents really went all out
with the cake.

136
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,488
Oh, well, it is Dante's birthday,
the most important day of the year.

137
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,803
Mijo was invited to play Carnegie Hall
when he was just 13 years old.

138
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,684
They invited the entire band, Mama'.

139
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,002
That doesn't make it any less worthwhile.

140
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,642
- Hey, what's up, man?
- Hey.

141
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,649
- Glad you could make it.
- Of course.

142
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,731
Hi, I'm Dante.

143
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,049
- This is my friend, Caitlin.
- Hi, Caitlin.

144
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,486
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

145
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,011
Here, I got you this.

146
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,001
- I think you'll really like it, it's...
- Thanks, man.

147
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,523
- Yeah.
- Excuse me.

148
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,001
I don't get it.

149
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,524
I've been running just as fast as I was when
it happened and nothing. I'm still here.

150
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,287
Anything could've triggered the Wormhole
that allowed you to repeat your day.

151
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,603
Your emotions, circumstances,
cortisol levels, all of the above.

152
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,043
I mean, my adrenaline was super high
since Iris and the entire city...

153
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,362
No, no, no, no details, I told you.

154
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,923
I'm sorry, but Mark Mardon's
already locked in the pipeline...

155
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,525
...and nothing bad has happened.

156
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,926
Yet.

157
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,924
- Detective.
- Hey. What are you doing here?

158
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,129
So when were you planning on telling me
you took down Mardon?

159
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,962
I just haven't had a chance yet.

160
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,487
- You got sidetracked.
- You can't be mad.

161
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,563
I'm not mad. But I am curious.

162
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,087
I mean, you were acting so weird
at the crime scene.

163
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,725
- I always act weird.
- Okay, weirder.

164
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:51,724
Look, Joe, there are just some things
that I can't tell you...

165
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,082
...and you're gonna have to trust me.

166
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,007
Hey, Linda.

167
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,801
Yeah, I know, I'm so sorry, I lost track.
I'm gonna head that way now.

168
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,004
All right, bye.

169
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,806
I have a lunch date with Linda.
I gotta run.

170
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,801
And I don't suppose
you're gonna fill me in either?

171
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,405
- No.
- Mm.

172
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,763
Here is one who was touched by God.

173
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,287
I was a little rusty.
I haven't played in a while.

174
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,761
Well, if that was what you sounded like
rusty...

175
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,764
...I can't imagine what you sound like
when you've practiced.

176
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,691
For you, I'd practice morning, noon
and night.

177
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,685
That means you'd actually have to get up
in the morning.

178
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,966
So Mom tells me you're still working
at S.T.A.R. Labs.

179
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,804
Yeah. Why?

180
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,325
No reason, man.

181
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,687
Guess it was just hard to find another job.

182
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,286
I wasn't looking.
I like working at S.T.A.R. Labs.

183
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,489
And we couldn't do what we do
without Cisco.

184
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,291
He's loyal. Just like a dog.

185
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,806
Come on, why are you so serious, mija?

186
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,723
Happy birthday.

187
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,484
Hey, I am here. So sorry again.

188
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,725
Well, you get a pass
considering you're never late.

189
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:23,166
Hey, what's going on with you lately?

190
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,331
Nothing.

191
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,370
Come on, give me a little credit here.

192
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:37,882
I've just been dealing
with a lot of things lately.

193
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,047
I like you, Linda, and we really get along.

194
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,283
Relationships should be more
than just getting along.

195
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,849
Your heart should ache for me.

196
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,485
Does it?

197
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,520
You're not upset with me?

198
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,923
No one did anything wrong.

199
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:09,370
I really do feel a lot for you, Linda.
It's just...

200
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:13,002
Just not as much as you feel
for someone else.

201
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,203
Go get her.

202
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,530
"The Flash. Speeding his way
into our lives."

203
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,921
That's a little bit on the nose,
don't you think?

204
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,724
I have something to show you.

205
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,405
Simon Stagg. Remember him?

206
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,483
Hasn't been heard from in nearly a year...

207
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,404
Hey, Iris. Mr. Bridge, hi.

208
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,401
Do I know you?

209
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:43,406
Oh. No. We haven't met. Yet. Fully.

210
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,847
- Iris, can I talk to you for a second?
- Uh, yeah, sure.

211
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,286
- We'll catch up later.
- Yeah.

212
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,761
Nice meeting you, strange young man.

213
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,447
Is everything okay with you and Linda?

214
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,880
Uh...

215
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,451
No, that's done.

216
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,251
Oh, I am so sorry.

217
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,647
No, no, no, it's okay,
we're gonna be friends.

218
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,962
Yeah, no, it's gonna be awesome.

219
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,362
Uh, anyway, are you...?

220
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,530
Are you free tomorrow?
Do you wanna get some coffee?

221
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,127
And we can just talk
and just tell each other stuff.

222
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,966
I don't know, stuff we got rolling around
in there. You know, I don't know.

223
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,164
Okay, yeah, sure, sounds great.

224
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,290
Okay, great. Great. All
right, I'll see you.

225
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,682
I know you think Harrison Wells
had something...

226
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,569
...to do with Simon Stagg's
disappearance.

227
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,960
But you're wrong.

228
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,648
- Hey.
- Oh, hey, man.

229
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,964
Thanks for meeting me here.
Even though, um, you can't get drunk.

230
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:55,370
- No worries.
- So how was your day?

231
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:59,161
Great. But Linda and I did break up.

232
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,931
That's the first time I've heard anyone
use the word "great" to describe a breakup.

233
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:08,842
I have a feeling that I'm about to move
forward with someone really special.

234
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,171
Okay, go ahead, Barry.

235
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:18,762
Hi. I don't normally do this,
but I was watching you and...

236
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,206
...can I buy you a drink?

237
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,851
Uh...

238
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,289
- Wow. I'm really flattered, but I...
- Actually, I was talking to him.

239
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,521
Um...

240
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,682
I'm sorry, you said you were talking to me?

241
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:36,162
Yeah, I just told my friends over there
that I thought you were cute...

242
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,529
...and they dared me to come over here
and talk to you.

243
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,761
So please talk to me.

244
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:46,881
Yeah, yeah, I suppose I can talk to you
for a little bit.

245
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,681
- Dude, get out.
- Yeah, I was just leaving.

246
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,689
Make me proud.

247
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,529
- I'm Lisa, by the way.
- Hi, Cisco.

248
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,883
I'm just in town for the symposium
at Mercury Labs.

249
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,805
- Really? What do you do?
- I'm a structural engineer.

250
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,451
Why do you look so surprised?
Can't a girl be an engineer?

251
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,762
No, of course. That's...

252
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,241
You just don't look like an engineer.

253
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,563
I can't help how I look.

254
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,328
I mean, it's good. It's a good look.
It's a great look.

255
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,008
You don't look so bad yourself.

256
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,567
Am I being pranked right now?

257
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,924
What do you think?

258
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,880
I can't believe this.
The day started out pretty terrible...

259
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,929
...but it's turning out pretty damn good.

260
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,650
- I'll say.
- Wow.

261
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,487
Look at this, these are nice digs.

262
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,324
Oh, we're just squatting.

263
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,926
- We?
- Yeah.

264
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,443
Me and my brother.

265
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,491
Hello, Cisco.

266
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,807
What exactly are your intentions
with my sister?

267
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,331
Oh, come on.

268
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,608
I should've known better.
I am not that lucky.

269
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,167
Please don't kill me for
kissing your sister.

270
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,367
You kissed him?

271
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,807
- You're not Dad, Lenny.
- I know, Dad's in jail.

272
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,291
Sterling role model.

273
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,886
What do you want, Snart?

274
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:21,647
Guns.
Heat and cold, to be precise.

275
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,687
There's no way I'm making weapons for you.

276
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,808
- Never again.
- Mick.

277
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,804
I know I would do everything in my power
to protect my family.

278
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,203
The question is, will you?

279
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,242
Dante, Dante, just keep cool, okay?
Let me do my thing.

280
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,882
Really? And you're gonna save us
with your "mechanical engineering" skills?

281
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:11,362
Right now my skills are the only things
keeping us alive, so shut up.

282
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,841
- You shut up.
- Ah.

283
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,128
There she is.

284
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,891
I missed this baby.

285
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,203
Here it is. All finished.
You gonna let us go now?

286
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,322
You know, I took the first gun you made me
apart dozens of times.

287
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,482
Learned how it ticked. What went where.

288
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,089
Thought you could tamper with the
firing pin without me noticing?

289
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,205
Nice try, kid.

290
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,046
Yes.

291
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,407
Lenny, where's my gun?

292
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,289
Girl's gotta defend herself.

293
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,884
Besides, why should you two
have all the fun?

294
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,568
My sister needs a weapon.

295
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,848
Something that suits her personality.

296
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,368
Make me something pretty and toxic.
Like me.

297
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,482
How about something with gold?

298
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,642
Gold. Heh.

299
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,887
Hey. One incredibly heavy cronut
and one Americano with an extra shot.

300
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:31,044
- Just the way I like it.
- Just the way you like it. Yeah, I know.

301
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,282
I know you, Iris. Ahem.

302
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,084
So, urn, what is going on with you?

303
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,123
You're acting like Christmas came early.

304
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,446
Heh. Uh...

305
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:46,286
Yeah, no, I guess it did, kind of.

306
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:53,561
Iris, I still think about you all the time,
and I know you've been thinking about me too.

307
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:58,123
- So let's just stop thinking and start doing.
- Barry.

308
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:02,001
I know. I know that we both have
awful timing, but we were meant to be...

309
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,083
Barry, what are you talking about?

310
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,849
You and me.

311
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,286
We like each other.

312
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,530
Barry, we've been over this.

313
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,489
Okay? Nothing has changed for me.

314
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,449
No, but it has.

315
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,441
How do you know that?

316
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,330
I just...

317
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,491
I just know some stuff. Somehow.

318
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,161
I don't know, maybe it's like ESP
or something...

319
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,530
Barry, I love Eddie, okay?

320
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,809
I'm sorry, but nothing has changed for me
since Christmas.

321
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,651
And you can't keep springing this on me,
okay?

322
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:43,209
It's not fair that you keep making me
the bad guy who keeps telling you no.

323
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,889
What? No whoosh in?

324
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,686
- I needed the walk.
- What happened?

325
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,205
Nothing. Uh...

326
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,890
Linda.

327
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,525
Iris.

328
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,371
I don't wanna talk about it actually.

329
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,364
Okay.

330
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:12,047
Have you talked to Cisco?
I've been trying, but he's not answering.

331
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,490
I'm kind of worried about him.
He had a rough night.

332
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,527
Trust me. It got better.

333
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,611
- Hey, Joe, what's up?
- Yeah, Snarfs back.

334
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,881
Wait, Cold is back?

335
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,884
Yeah, he was spotted
at the Santini crime family casino.

336
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,169
If he's hitting the Santinis, we could be
looking at a mob war.

337
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,364
Well, this day just keeps getting better,
doesn't it?

338
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,730
You killed my brother.

339
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,082
You shouldn't have messed with my family.

340
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,529
That's funny, I was gonna say
the same thing about ours.

341
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,761
All that glitters.

342
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,761
This is sick.

343
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,088
You wanted us to spend more time together.

344
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,602
How many times
are we gonna go through this?

345
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,450
Until the best man wins.

346
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,401
Drop the gun.

347
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,329
We both know you're not
going to do anything to her.

348
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,762
Oh, by the way, meet my baby sister.

349
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,928
Lisa, Flash. Flash, Lisa.

350
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,444
Cisco has been very, very busy.

351
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,487
Unless you want me to mail small,
frozen pieces of him back to his family...

352
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,243
...I'd take your hands off her.

353
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,361
Let him go, Snart.

354
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,366
I'll think about it.

355
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,963
God.

356
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,569
Barr.

357
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,329
Witnesses reported seeing the Flash.

358
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,603
They said you had Snart dead to rights,
but you let him go. Why?

359
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,966
Cisco.

360
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,401
- Snart and his sister have him.
- Oh, man.

361
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,729
Okay. Get to S.T.A.R. Labs.
I'll get there when I can.

362
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,845
All right.

363
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,203
- Allen.
- Eddie, I...

364
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,169
Whoa!

365
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,528
- Stay away from Iris.
- What is going on here?

366
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,770
- Hey, if you two have a beef, take it outside.
- You know what the worst part is, Barry?

367
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,883
I thought you and I were friends.

368
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,724
So there's Cisco getting into a car
with Snart's sister.

369
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,490
The license plate is iced over.

370
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,528
All right, Dr. Wells, you were right.

371
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,041
I screwed with time,
now time is screwing with me.

372
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,402
Cold is back, he kidnapped Cisco,
and lris...

373
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:30,211
Stop before you cause
another disruption to the timeline.

374
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,402
Please, Dr. Wells.

375
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:37,201
Please, I have to talk to someone.

376
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,481
Go ahead.

377
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:47,721
In the previous version of today...

378
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,681
...Captain Singh is seriously injured...

379
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:55,845
...Joe is in danger,
and Iris said she had feelings for me.

380
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:02,210
And now Cisco's life is on the line and Iris
has no idea she confessed those feelings.

381
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,051
But she still has them, right?

382
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:15,283
The unconscious mind, Barry,
is a powerful thing.

383
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,521
It sounds like...

384
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:23,643
...it took this apparent
disaster to jar those feelings loose.

385
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,447
And without that disaster,
those feelings remain deeper down.

386
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,450
Un-accessed.

387
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,807
I don't understand.

388
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,971
I thought that I was helping people
by stopping Mardon.

389
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:42,087
Yes, but this new ability of yours,
Barry, is a dangerous thing.

390
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,641
You only traveled back in time one day.
What if you traveled back decades?

391
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,529
Centuries?

392
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,485
Imagine the havoc you could wreak.

393
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:58,486
But I will have the opportunity...

394
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:04,204
...to travel back in time in the
near future and save my mom.

395
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,166
Are...? You're saying I shouldn't?

396
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:14,290
I'm saying how many more
people could die...

397
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,889
...if your mother lives?

398
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,003
Did you guys find Cisco?

399
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:27,371
Most people think the hottest part
of the flame is the white part.

400
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,329
They're wrong.

401
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,162
You gonna admire those or drink them?

402
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,128
Both.

403
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,921
I told her you wanted to become a priest.

404
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,571
Broke her heart.

405
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,046
Why'd you do that?

406
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,849
Because I was jealous of you, man.

407
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:26,080
Even then,
I knew exactly where my life was headed.

408
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,208
- Nowhere.
- Dante...

409
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,167
...that's not true.

410
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:33,682
I live at home
and I work a crap job for no pay.

411
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,685
Yeah, but you still manage to be
Mom and Dad's favorite.

412
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,083
I don't even know why.

413
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:44,410
It's because they still think of me
as their son, the concert pianist.

414
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,371
But you, man,
they never understood your talents.

415
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,124
Never understood that you pursued
your passion no matter what.

416
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,891
And me, I was just too scared to even try.

417
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,364
Dan... Dante.

418
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,761
No.

419
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,887
Mick?

420
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,168
Mick, calm down.

421
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,601
Mick. We need them.

422
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,881
Mick.

423
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,363
Baby, it sounds like you're hungry.

424
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,325
How about you and I grab some dinner?

425
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,961
I like you, kid.

426
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:37,210
You're smart, you pulled yourself up
from humble beginnings.

427
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,010
You seem like a good brother.

428
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,329
Yeah. You too.

429
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,885
Debatable.

430
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:47,045
You answer one question for me,
I'll let you and your brother walk.

431
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:53,044
- What's the question?
- The Flash, who is he?

432
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:59,045
I swear, he always wears a mask.

433
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,840
No! No, stop.

434
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,367
This is first-degree frostbite.

435
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,847
Your brother could recover
with proper treatment.

436
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:12,681
If not, all his tendons, blood vessels
and nerves will freeze.

437
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,281
His fingers will need to be amputated.

438
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:18,563
No more concertos
for the Ramon family holidays.

439
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:23,527
Now tell me, who is the Flash?

440
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,802
There's nothing
on the satellite thermography.

441
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,525
You were right. This is my fault.

442
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:39,048
- How is this your fault?
- Brave heart, Barry. We'll get Cisco back.

443
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,409
I'm back.

444
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,204
My God, are you okay?

445
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,562
We were so worried.

446
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,280
- What happened?
- How did you escape?

447
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,965
I didn't.

448
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,162
Snart just let you go. Why?

449
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,850
He tortured my brother.

450
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:04,608
And he said he was gonna kill him
if I didn't...

451
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,410
If I didn't tell him...

452
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,161
Tell him what?

453
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,449
Who the Flash really is.

454
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,242
L... Honestly, man, they
could've killed me...

455
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,809
...but they were gonna kill my brother.

456
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,126
I couldn't let them do that.

457
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,961
H9)'-

458
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:33,243
- I'm sorry, Barry. I'm so sorry.
- No.

459
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,842
I put you in that position.

460
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,125
I'm the one who's sorry.

461
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,086
Where you going?

462
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,647
I don't deserve to be here.

463
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,844
I won't be the one
to put you in jeopardy, not again.

464
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,687
Never again.

465
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,761
H9)'-

466
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,202
What? What a surprise.

467
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,762
As big a surprise as Eddie punching Barry
at a crime scene this evening.

468
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,803
Oh, my God. ls Barry okay?

469
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,765
Yeah, he heals fast.

470
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,928
Look, Iris, this got complicated.

471
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,283
I know. I'm sorry.

472
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,644
Barry was too late. I'm with Eddie.

473
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,085
Let me ask you something.

474
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,284
Who do you love?

475
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,366
I mean, I love Eddie.

476
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,522
Okay. You need to make them believe that...

477
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,808
...because I'm not sure
either of them does.

478
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,884
Okay?

479
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,487
Did I ever tell you
how wise and amazing you are?

480
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,960
Not enough.

481
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,207
See you later.

482
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,484
- Bad time?
- Yes, actually.

483
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,011
Don't worry, I'll be out of here soon.

484
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:30,683
Well, before you shuffle off forever...

485
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,484
...may I show you something?

486
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,406
I get it.

487
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,244
- I failed.
- No, no, no.

488
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,767
Now, you're an incredibly
clever guy, Cisco.

489
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,884
So why don't you tell me...

490
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,250
...why would I bring you down here?

491
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,248
Because we all failed that night,
but we kept going.

492
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:06,601
We kept trying to protect each other
and Barry, despite the setbacks.

493
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:10,282
Making a choice between
two people you love...

494
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,761
...that is the hardest dilemma
you will ever face.

495
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:17,922
Well, you won't have to worry about me
making the wrong decision again.

496
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,851
All you proved today, Mr. Ramon...

497
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,246
...is that you're human.

498
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:26,450
All you proved today
is that you love your brother.

499
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,961
And the reason that we
all want you to stay...

500
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,971
...is that we love you too.

501
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,284
Now, I am not a parent...

502
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:43,761
...but in many ways, you have shown me
what it's like to have a son.

503
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,201
Guys, you should get up here.

504
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,407
Shall we?

505
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,849
The casino wasn't the target.

506
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,610
Then why did he do it?

507
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:04,646
Casinos keep tons of cash on hand
to cover their markers.

508
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:08,640
But if they're under attack, protocol is
to relocate the money outside the casino.

509
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:12,083
So that was Snart's plan all along,
to trigger the move.

510
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,401
Okay, where is it now?

511
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,811
Get ready. We got company.

512
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:25,400
Good to see you, Barry.

513
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,803
We have to talk.

514
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,041
I know Cisco told you who I am.

515
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,047
Can't really blame the
kid for giving you up.

516
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:41,841
You or his brother? Come on.
I put him in a tight spot.

517
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,486
Same kind I got you in right now.

518
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,328
Can't really stop me,
now that I know who you are.

519
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:52,241
I could speed you to my private prison
where you'll never see the light of day.

520
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,211
But then I won't be around
to stop my own private uplink...

521
00:35:55,400 --> 00:36:00,247
...that'll broadcast your identity to the
world. So the million-dollar question:

522
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,086
What to do with me now, Barry Allen?

523
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:07,086
I won't let you keep stealing whatever
you want, whenever you feel like it.

524
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,084
- It needs to end.
- Can't do that.

525
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,402
- It's what I do.
- Find a new line of work.

526
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,082
- Don't want to.
- Why's that?

527
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,410
The same reason
you keep running after guys like me.

528
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,728
The adrenaline. The thrill of the chase.

529
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:24,410
I love this game. And I'm very good at it.

530
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,284
Then go play it somewhere else.

531
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,767
- Leave Central City.
- Can't do that either.

532
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,610
I love it here.

533
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,683
This city is my home.

534
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,367
You've seen what I can do.

535
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,683
You know that I can stop you.

536
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,809
You wanna keep pushing
your luck, go for it.

537
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,681
But from here on out, no one else dies.

538
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,285
If you're as good as you say...

539
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,040
...you don't have to kill anyone
to get what you want.

540
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,766
That's true.

541
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:04,802
And if you or anyone
in your rogues gallery...

542
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,971
...goes near
any of my friends or family again...

543
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:12,926
...I don't care who you
tell my identity to.

544
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,889
I'm putting you away.

545
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:23,328
I guess your secret's safe, Flash.

546
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,326
For now.

547
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:37,289
Oh, I don't suppose you'd give me
a ride back to town, would you?

548
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,286
The Rogues.

549
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,371
Cute.

550
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,170
I am so sorry, pal.

551
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:06,967
It's not like me to hit anyone.
I don't know what came over me.

552
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,208
Uh, thanks, Eddie. It's okay.

553
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,966
You poor thing. I had no idea.

554
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,730
Is that right? Um...

555
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,360
But what exactly
did you have no idea about?

556
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:20,082
I was just explaining to Iris and
Eddie about your Lightning Psychosis.

557
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,841
- My what now?
- Your Lightning Psychosis.

558
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,647
How your recent odd behavior is a side
effect of being struck by lightning.

559
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:31,962
Mood swings, sudden outbursts of affection,
and other lapses in judgment.

560
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:35,363
He has had all of those things.
He told me that he had ESP.

561
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,722
It's a very uncommon
neurological phenomenon.

562
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:41,089
We're really only just now starting
to research in kerauno-medicine.

563
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:44,005
That's why Barry's been
spending time at S.T.A.R. Labs.

564
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,649
I just wish you would've told me.

565
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,850
It hardly feels real sometimes.

566
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,042
- We're just glad you're getting help.
- Yeah.

567
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:56,645
- So we're good?
- Yeah, we're good.

568
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,843
- Coffee?
- Yeah.

569
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,364
- Thank you.
- You are welcome.

570
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,406
Oh, come on. Hey.

571
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,440
Harrison Wells.

572
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,810
What do you know about him?

573
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,685
What do you know?

574
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,689
Everything I know is in that drive.

575
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,321
I swear.

576
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,808
Everything?

577
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,489
Everything. Just take it.

578
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:14,165
You really were
on to the story of the century.

579
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:19,210
Well, this century anyway.

580
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,800
Do you think I made a mistake?
Letting Snart go?

581
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,241
You did what you felt
was right in the moment.

582
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:40,810
And really, Barry,
that's the best any of us can hope for.

583
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,606
For now, let's be thankful
the timeline remains intact.

584
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:51,764
Oh, I keep forgetting, I've been meaning
to ask you. It's about Simon.

585
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,046
You were saying, Mr. Allen?

586
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,770
Uh...

587
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,162
Nothing. Sorry.

588
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:05,011
- 'Night, Dr. Wells.
- Goodnight, Barry.

589
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,931
Barr, what's up?

590
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,083
Why'd you wanna meet up here so late?

591
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:42,368
I think that maybe
you were right about Dr. Wells.

592
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,001
Which part?

593
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,329
All of it.

594
00:41:49,305 --> 00:41:55,301
