00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:07,590

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,398
John.

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,520
Michael.

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:21,114
The chief constable of Birmingham
has issued a warrant for your arrest.

5

<i>I've made a deal with people
even more powerful than our enemies.</i>

7
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,800
Father.

8
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,999
What is it, Sunday?

9
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,958
There's been a mistake.

10
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,696
There's an appeal process underway
that doesn't begin until January.

11
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,757
I want to see my lawyer, Mr Patrick.

12
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,480
Stop! This shouldn't be happening!

13
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,640
Get your hands off me!

14
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,513
All right! I'm John Shelby!

15
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,640
Clean up when I come back.
When I come back I gotta be clean.

16
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,476
Whatever I said, whatever I decided.

17
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,114
Whatever I decide...

18
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,797
Michael? Michael?

19
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,394
Arthur!

20
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,278
- Arthur!
- John!

21
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,555
Where's Tommy?

22
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,916
- Arthur! Arthur!
- No!

23
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,680
No.

24
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,234
Arthur,
you have to call the King.

25
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,757
- About what?
- About this.

26
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,117
This is the case of a family
of Birmingham gangsters

27
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,078
on trial for murder and sedition.

28
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,080
Why would the King intervene?

29
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,517
The leader of the gang, Thomas Shelby.

30
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,560
He claims his family was
caught up in a wider conspiracy.

31
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,075
He names Winston Churchill.

32
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,238
- You woke me up for this?
- And he also sent us this.

33
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,200
How the fuck did a Birmingham racketeer

34
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,559
get his hands on a personal letter
written by King George?

35
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,639
During a robbery at Hampton Court,

36
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,757
Shelby discovered
a box of correspondence.

37
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,600
Among the papers he stole
was that letter from the King himself,

38
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,471
which proves his Majesty was involved.

39
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,119
Oh, utter fuck.

40
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,556
<i>If his family walks free,</i>

41
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,916
<i>then he will burn the papers
in my presence.</i>

42
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,555
<i>When are they due to hang?</i>

43
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,238
Today. This morning
in Winson Green prison.

44
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,719
Why the hell
didn't you bring it up before?

45
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,914
The plan was
for the Lord Chamberlain

46
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,434
to intervene at the appeal

47
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,598
but late last night some localjudge
brought the executions forward.

48
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,909
Oh, my giddy aunt.

49
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,599
Put me through to His Majesty.

50
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,160
Well, wake him up!

51
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,795
In the bleak midwinter.

52
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,514
In the bleak midwinter.

53
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,031
Thy Kingdom come. Thy will be done...

54
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,596
Help, Lord Jesus,

55
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,954
with this rope pull me up to heaven.

56

I've wrapped all Charlie's presents
and left them in the room.

What did I get him?

89
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,792
Toy horses, toy cars, toy guns.

90
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,976
You're due at the Singer factory
at eight tomorrow, not eight thirty,

there's a union problem.

- Yes, ma'am.

97
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,320
Tommy, I've had Christmas cards from

A party at John's big house,

102
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,272
Ada's coming back from Boston for it.

103
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,393
I know.

104
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,392
It was me who gave her the time off.

105
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,517
Why don't you come?
Just turn up, bring Charlie,

The babies will make everybody okay,
babies stop everything.

110
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,229
Can't pull a razor with a baby there,

111

- Theresa.

119
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,679

120
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,720

121
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,199

122
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,474
I'll get Charlie a real horse, Lizzie.

123
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,196
Not a toy, a thoroughbred.

124
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,760
And on Christmas day
it'll be just you and Charlie.

00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,430
And the horse.

126

Can't live like this another year.

00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,756
I wasn't asking about you,
Michael, was I?

164
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,951
I was asking about your mother.

165
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,870
Since she was pardoned
she's been on these fucking tablets

166
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,031
the doctor gave her
when she was in the prison.

167
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,191
She says that
when she was inside the noose

168
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,278
she saw spirits.

169
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,680
She's running séances

170
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,080
but people just come into the house
to steal things.

171
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,715
- Tommy, it's bad.
- All right, all right.

172
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,791
All right, listen to me, Michael.

173
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,200
The spirits she sees

174
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,111
are real.

175
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,475
Believe they're real.

176
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,590
Believe it with her.

177
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,232
And eventually,

178
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,879
you can take the remembered noose

179
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,556
from around her neck,

180
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,069
like a horse
that's been choked off.

181
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,513
Keep her off whiskey,

182
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,829
throw away the tablets,

183
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,919
and stop giving her fucking snow.

184
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,678
Fuck, Tommy,
sounds like family advice.

185
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,272
You coming back?

186
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,352
Nothing to come back to.

187
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,394
Truth is they're all fucked.

188
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,073
The lot of them.

189
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,958
Yeah.

190
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,553
Find out about that woman, Jessie Eden.

191
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,195
Don't let your mother
keep cash in the house. And oi,

192
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,916
no cocaine on the registered premises.

193
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,394
Did you see they all came?

194
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,873
Yeah, I saw you at the back.

195
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,472
It's funny they don't notice.

196
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,753
Oh, my sweet.

197
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,718
Oh, my heart.

198
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,998
Crushed to death in the canal,

199
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,274
but back home again.

200
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,994
It's so beautiful.

201
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,757
Inside the loop.

202
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,917
Inside the merry loop.

203
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,989
For fuck's sake.

204
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,153
Fucking birds.

205
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,799
Ada.

206
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,114

00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,509
No.

212
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,478
Well, this beats Watery Lane, John.

213
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,434
Does it?
Here, take a seat, I'll grab the kids.

214
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,992
No, it's all right,

00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,309
I'm not stopping.

216
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,710
Just wanna drop those presents off
for tomorrow.

217
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,599
I don't want words on Christmas Eve.

218
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,240
Well, it's my house, you're welcome.

219
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,791
It's okay, I'm staying with Polly.

220
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,395
Huh, she's in a bad way.

221
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,752
Mm. I'll bring her to her senses.

222
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,400
- Michael's already tried that.
- I'll get through to her.

223
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,837
You still gonna come to the party
on New Year's Eve?

224
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,314
Yeah, who else is coming?

225
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,598
Arthur, Linda.

226
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,799
Hello, Esme.

227
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,072
Who paid for your car and driver, Ada?

228
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,560
Shelby Company Limited.

229
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,871
Nice car, treats you well,

230
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,475
his last little pet.

231
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,674
Look, this visit is meant to be
about making things all right.

232
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,720
John had a rope around his neck,
he shit himself.

233
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,632
All right, Esme, that'll do, yeah.

234
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,197
Go on, go in the kitchen.

235
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,397
Take the cars back to the money.

236
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,437
Anyway, there's your presents.

237
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,396
How's Arthur?

238
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,597
Uh, for Christmas get him a sewing kit,

239
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,631
so he can sew his fucking balls back on.

240
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,596
Maypole 245.

241
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,560
Hello, Esme.

242
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,758
There you go, look,
couple of eggs, eh, two eggs.

243
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,594
Off you go.

244
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,912
Arthur, be careful with Billy
in there, there's a cock.

245
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,080
Yeah, I will.

246
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,071
And don't smoke that near him.

247
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,913
All right.

248
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,831
Get out of it.

249
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,957
Esme called to say
Ada's on her way over.

250
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,879
Did you hear that, Billy boy?

251
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,512
Your auntie Ada's coming,
all the way from America.

252
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,400
Bye, chickens.

253
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,033
Oh, we dropped an egg, look.

254
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,513
We dropped an egg, Billy boy.

255
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,037
Give him the hell he gives us,
Miss Eden.

The male wire cutters

00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,514
a mile and a half down the road

269
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,839
are paid ten shillings a week more
than the female wire cutters here.

270
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,399
Different factories, different rates.

271
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,196
But both factories
are owned by you, Mr Shelby.

272
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,718
Not in your own name, of course,

273
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,632
in the name of Arrow House Holdings.

274
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,392
You own the Manchester
Car and Van Factory

275
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,233
in the name of Tilton Company Limited,

276

the Billings Machine tools

So this isn't about
women and men, it's about me, eh?

285
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,110
Tommy Shelby, OBE.
No, it's not about you.

286
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,555
It's about disparities.

287
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,256
It's about ten shillings a week
for working mothers

288
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,736
so they can buy shoes for their kids.

289
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,956
- Never had shoes meself.
- So now you deny others?

290
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,277
And barefoot I grew up mean.

291
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,476
Oh, I know.

292
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,835
Oh, yeah, you know everything.

293
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,072
- Your turn of phrase...
- Is unacceptable?

294
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,520
You grew up mean you say.
Threat in there I think somewhere.

295
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,750
No threats.

296
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,600
The whole of Birmingham
knows you, Mr Shelby.

297
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,751
Sweetheart,

298
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,672
whatever you've heard

299
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,274
I don't need to make threats.

300
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,234
My comrade brothers and sisters...

301
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,472
Your brothers and sisters!
All right, listen,

302
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,630
I will conduct myself as a businessman.

303
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,836
Who says sweetheart.

304
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:44,755
You say there's a ten shilling disparity
between male and female cutters

305
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,439
in two of my factories.

306
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,398
Very well.

307
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,075
I will increase the pay
of the female cutters

308
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,152
in this factory by five shillings

309
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,920
and I will cut the pay
of the male cutters

310
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,390
in the Rover by five shillings,

311
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,154
thereby achieving
your sacred fucking parity.

312
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,273
And I will tell the men

313
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,760
with families to feed

314
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,870
whose idea it was to cut their pay.

315
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,510
You do that, I will bring
all my members out on strike.

316
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,399
Oh, yeah?
A week after Christmas, you think so?

317
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,456
You know, everything
you've said here today

318
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,400
and the fact that
we're having this meeting today

319
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,834
tells me that you're a woman
without a family.

320
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,120
And everything I hear about you tells me
you're a man without a family as well.

321
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,158
My comrade brothers and sisters
are not afraid of you, Mr Shelby.

322
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,679
I will call an extraordinary meeting
of my executive committee

323
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,353
as soon as Boxing Day.

324
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,591
You will hear the whistles blow
all across Birmingham.

325
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,030
I've heard
lots of whistles blow, sweetheart.

326
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,800
The post has arrived, Mr Shelby.

327
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,880
I'm sorry to keep asking

328
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,236
but chef needs to know
how many for dinner tomorrow.

329
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,440
He's new,

330
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,598
he's foreign, he gets very upset.

331
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,075
Right. Well, you tell chef

332
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,755
there'll be 27 guests
for Christmas dinner tomorrow.

333
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,240
Twenty-seven?

334
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,152
- Family?
- Yep.

335
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,118
I thought Charlie could do
with some company

336
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,193
so I asked Johnny Dogs
if he knew anyone who liked to eat goose

337
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,999
and he said he knew 26.

338
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,876
Tell chef I want ten geese,
a buck cut into steaks,

339
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,600
some trout from the river,

340
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,594
fetch whisky, brandy and wine
from the cellar, best we have.

341
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,875
There will be children?

342
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,670
Lots of children.

343
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,874
With Johnny's tribe, new ones
might be born on the floor,

344
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,234
so have...
have mops and buckets ready, eh?

345
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,594
And I want you at the table, Frances,
so make it 28.

346
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,920
I will be busy.

347
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,576
You've put up with me this past year,

348
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,456
looked after Charlie
when I've been on business,

349
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,154
tomorrow you will eat at my table.

350
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,192
Things will get better,
I think, next year.

351
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,435
Uh-huh.

352
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,510
Gets much warmer than here in the
summer, much colder in the winter.

353
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,829
I knew it.

354
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,520
But parts of it
are just like Birmingham.

355
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,674
Yeah. Shit and smoke
the same everywhere.

356
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:46,197
Hmm. What about you, Linda?
You working?

357
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,438
I've been seeking work as a teacher.

358
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,273
- Teacher.
- Hmm, but you know,

359
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,832
it's quite difficult. The Shelby name
is always in the papers.

360
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,031
And, uh, what do you get up to
all day, Arthur?

361
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,231
As you know Arthur's previous endeavours
have left us with no need for a salary.

362
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,438
Arthur occupies his time in the garden,

363
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,559
doing voluntary work.

364
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,919
He drives old people and cripples.

365
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,037
- Oh.
- Yeah, well, something to do.

366
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,069
I wanna open a garage.

367
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,713
- Someday.
- Fixing cars, you know?

368
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,792
Sometimes cars attract ambitious men.

369
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,674
Yeah, but.

370
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,717
- I like fixing cars.
- Hmm.

371
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,800
I'll go.

372
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,678
I got it.

373
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,353
Maypole 244.

374
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,869
Arthur, have you checked your post?

375
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,993
I just got served a black hand.

376
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,956
I just got delivered
a black fucking hand to the house

377
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,395
from Luca Changretta.

378
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,074
Jesus.

379
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,709
Jesus Christ!

380
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,593
Wait a minute, John, which one's Luca?

381
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,790
<i>The old man's oldest son.</i>

382
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,520
<i>He was gonna get done
for killing a bank clerk in a robbery.</i>

383
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,077
<i>So his old man
sent him back to New York.</i>

384
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,630
You know what the black hand
means among the wops, Arthur?

385
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,990
It's Mafia shit.

386
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,033
The Sicilian fucking Mafia.

387
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,477
<i>Just check your post, Arthur.</i>

388
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,520
Arthur, I was just leaving.

389
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,478
No, you're not.

390
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:41,280
I need... I need to talk to you.

391
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,840
- Arthur?
- It's all right, Linda.

392
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,233
Stay here. Ada, please?

393
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,953
Linda, you stay here.

394
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,755
Did you say Mafia?

395
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,110
Esme, I need to make a call.

396
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,078
- No.
- I need to make a fucking call.

397
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,833
- Give it here!
- What the fuck is this?

398
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,957
- Give it here!
- Tell me what the fuck it is.

399
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,520
- Give it here.
- What is it?

400
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,239
It's from Luca Changretta,
All right? We killed his dad.

401
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,834
I remember.

402
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,976
It was Tommy who killed him.

403
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,595
It was fucking...
Arthur pulled the trigger.

404
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,551
All right, it was mercy,
but it was Arthur.

405
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,193
Anyway, it makes no fucking difference.

406
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,989
For the wops it's family.

407
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:36,311
The black hand came here,
everybody will have got one.

408
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,471
They're coming for us all.

409
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,599
We made an agreement.

410
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,398
We made a solemn promise.

411
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,439
We're the family now.

412
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,672
Here, look at that.

413
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,839
That's from Changretta's son, Luca.

414
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,792
How the fuck he knows where I live, eh?

415
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,830
And why has he waited a year?

416
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,997
I'm gonna see Tommy next,
I'll talk to him.

417
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,074
I've been served a black hand

418
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,474
and she won't even let me keep
a fucking spud gun in the house.

419
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,074
Go to a hotel.

420
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,913
It's Christmas Eve, Ada.

421
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,280
I've got a gun in the glove compartment,
you take that for now.

422
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,114
I'll talk to Tommy and have him call,

423
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,696
just make sure
you get to the phone first.

424
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,154
- Yeah.
- Now,

425
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,960
hug me like you came out here
'cause you were emotional.

426
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,199
I am emotional.

427
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,192
I just don't know
what fucking emotion it is.

428
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,275
It'll be okay. I'll talk to Tommy.

429
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,070
You talk to him.

430
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,756
You and me both, brother.

431
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,760
Ada?

432
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,520
You wait there.

433
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,751
You won't leave empty-handed,
here you go, look.

434
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,112
Some eggs, you get them
to Polly, all right?

435
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,640
And you, keep your eyes on the road.

436
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,037
- Take care.
- Mm.

437
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,078
Who was on the phone, Arthur?

438
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,800
John, wishing me Merry Christmas.

439
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,834
Come inside,

440
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,718
it's getting late.

441
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,000
Thanks.

442
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,960
Take off the hat.

443
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,039
Are you with those other Italians?

444
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,679
We're Americans,

445
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,238
says it right there on the paper.

446
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,519
USA.

447
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,240
And what's the purpose of your visit?

448
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,960
Pleasure.

449
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,631
Mum? It's me.

450
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,597
- Left the door open.
- To change the air.

451
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,520
I told you I was busy today,
what do you want?

452
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,480
Why haven't you opened your post?

453
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,994
Tidied up.

454
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,197
Ada's coming today.

455
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,839
She's late.

456
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,030
Tommy asked about you today.

457
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,753
I hope Ada's car hasn't broken down.

458
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,712
Shelby Company Limited
still using Bentleys?

459
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,717
Yeah.

460
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,076
Bentleys are no good in the cold.
You should tell him.

461
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,350
I will.

462
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,269
Any other messages for Tommy?

463
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,680
Yeah, fuck off.

464
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,198
He saw that your drainpipe was broken.

465
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,517
He's worried.

466
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,874
Is that it?
Is that all he asked about, drainpipes?

467
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,350
No, he said that I'm to accept
that you have a gift.

468
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,034
That you've always had a gift.

469
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,190
What gift?

470
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,919
Second sight.

471
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,319
Spirits, all that gypsy stuff.

472
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,754
He said that I'm to believe you.

473
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,435
You think I don't hear
his voice in yours?

474
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,432
You don't think
I recognise his strategies?

475
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,112
- I'm still a match for him.
- Yes,

476
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,520
you are.

477
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,156
And you still can be.

478
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,919
Me and Lizzie decided

479
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,560
that this new year
we're all to turn a page.

480
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,296
You can't spend
another year like this, Mum.

481
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,720
Mum.

482
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,079
Mum.

483
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,511
Word is like a bullet to me.

484
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,311
See your sister in that chair sometimes.

485
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,317
Look,

486
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,153
me and Lizzie decided.

487
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,518
It's time.

488
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:31,194
I bought these.
One for you and Ada...

489
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,718
One for you and me.

490
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,039
So Tommy said, keep her off the whisky?

491
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,236
I'll drink champagne

492
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,199
the day my son leaves the employment
of Shelby Company Ltd.

493
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,319
You tell him that next time
he mentions fucking drainpipes.

494
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,319
Right, now, this is your job, Charlie.

495
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,996
Now, give those to Santa,

496
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,480
and Rudolf.

497
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,755
Good boy.

498
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,192
Leave this out for Santa,
that's whisky.

499
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,079
Now, night-night. Merry Christmas.

500
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,791
I'll see you tomorrow.
All right? Sleep well.

501
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,872
Come on, Charlie.

502
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,195
Mr Shelby, it's your sister.

503
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,439
I know. Send her in.

504
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,998
I've had a card, Ada. I'm guessing
Arthur and John have had one as well.

505
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:12,435
"Hello, Tommy."
"Hello, Ada, welcome home."

506
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:15,194
"Thanks, it's nice to be back."

507
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,600
I've spoken to Moss.

508
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,680
Moss says that Changretta
is a soldier for the Spinetta family,

509
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,016
which means that he'll have men
with him, professional men.

510
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,999
They usually operate
in units of around ten.

511
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,874
Moss is checking Cunard records
to see if they're already in England.

512
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,398
This one's for you.

513
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,874
What is it, a time machine?

514
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:38,519
My God, Tommy Shelby, is that regret?

515
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,913
I'll open it tomorrow.

516
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:45,953
So, boss, in light of the changed
circumstances, what are your orders?

517
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,759
Changretta knows where we all live.

518
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,839
If we stay out in the open, isolated,
he'll pick us off one by one.

519
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,520
We need to be together in a place
even they won't dare to come.

520
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,749
You mean, back home?

521
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,680
Within a four-mile radius
of the Garrison,

522
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,752
every man is a guard
and a soldier for us.

523
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,479
I'm calling a family meeting.

524
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,199
Charlie Strong's yard, Boxing Day.

525
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,440
Finn's already there.

526
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,776
You tell Polly and Michael,
I'll deal with John and Arthur.

527
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,200
And Esme and Linda?

528
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,640
Anyone who wants to live
to see another Christmas

529
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:24,758
needs to come where it's safe.
These bastards will kill kids as well.

530
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,316
When this business is finished we can

531
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,119
go our separate ways.

532
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,154
Go and see Polly and explain.
She'll have had a card as well.

533
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,233
Do you think I'm on the list?

534
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,752
We're all on the list, Ada.

535
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,080
I gave my gun to Arthur.

536
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,595
Welcome home.

537
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,555
Hm.

538
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,318
Holy shit.

539
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,234
- It's Father Christmas.
- Yeah.

540
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,437
And if you're good

541
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,477
you get what you deserve.

542
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,199
Fucking come here, you.

543
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,073
Fuck.

544
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,951
Yeah, put me through to Maypole 245.

545
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,477
<i>- Hello?
- Arthur, it's Tommy.</i>

546
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,674
Be quick, they're asleep.

547
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:38,678
Family meeting, Charlie's Yard,
Boxing Day, midday.

548
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,399
I can't raise John
but I'll send Michael to get him.

549
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,635
If you have to pull a gun
on Linda, do it.

550
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,518
Merry Christmas.

551
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,432
Merry Christmas, Tom.

552
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,114
What did you do with them?

553
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:09,760
My tablets were in the bathroom cabinet.
What did you do with them?

554
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,032
I threw them in the lavatory.

555
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:17,080
- Tommy's orders?
- No. My own decision.

556
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:25,433
How am I gonna get through Christmas
without them? They close everything.

557
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,656
How am I gonna get through Christmas
without them?

558
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,751
- I'll help you.
- They don't open anything.

559
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,240
Fucking no apocethary, nothing.

560
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,677
You can move in with me
and I'll help you.

561
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,117
How am I gonna get through
fucking Christmas,

562
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,078
without... without anything?

563
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,398
You can move in with me
and I'll help you.

564
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:51,838
Fuck off. Fuck off.
Fuck off, Thomas Shelby. Fuck off.

565
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,176
It's all right, it was me.
I just want you to stop, just stop.

566
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,096
- I just want the tablets.
- This has got to stop!

567
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:58,589
Tommy said to believe in spirits
with you but I can't.

568
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,831
Hello, Polly. Hello, Michael.

569
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,360
Merry Christmas.

570
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,400
Door was wide open.

571
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,350
Fuck.

572
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:11,512
I spent the whole day tidying up,
I wanted it to be nice.

573
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,554
I wanted it to look nice.

574
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,871
All right, Poll, it's only me.

575
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,270
It's okay. It's okay, we can sit.

576
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:22,440
Sit and talk, we'll put things
back together. It's okay.

577
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,876
- I'll leave you two to it.
- No, you stay.

578
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,595
Now listen, something's happened.

579
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,399
Things have changed.

580
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,469
Today, everyone in the family

581
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,312
received one of these.

582
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,794
- What does it mean?
- Tommy's called a family meeting.

583
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,558
He wants you both to come.

584
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,998
Come.

585
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:16,200
I'm really sorry
to bother you again, sir,

586
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,795
but chef insists on knowing
what time the guests will arrive.

587
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,798
Frances, for the last time,

588
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,473
it's Johnny Dogs,

589
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:26,789
they're gypsies,

590
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,234
they're camped down by the river.

591
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:30,710
When they're ready they'll walk up.
All right?

592
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:34,315
- He says it's about preparation, sir.
- What is?

593
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,710
He's asked specifically,

594
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,110
will they arrive
before the King's speech or after?

595
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,392
You said he was new, this chef.

596
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,790
- When did he join us?
- October.

597
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,078
October.

598
00:44:58,440 --> 00:44:59,920
And he's foreign?

599
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,480
- He's Italian, sir.
- Oh.

600
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,756
He's the best chef
we've ever had in the house.

601
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,950
No shouting or swearing or blaspheming.

602
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:12,397
- Do we know his references?
- Yes.

603
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,717
The only problem has been his assistant.

604
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,320
What assistant?

605
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:22,592
He brought an assistant with him,
he calls him his sous chef.

606
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,272
Are they still working, Frances?

607
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,033
They'll be there till midnight, sir.

608
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,720
All right, thank you.
Goodnight, you can go to bed.

609
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,429
Merry Christmas, sir.

610
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,120
And I thought about your offer,

611
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:49,118
I'd be happy to sit at your table.

612
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:52,719
All right, thank you.

613
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:23,878
Mr Shelby.

614
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:32,955
What's your name?

615
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,713
- Max, Mr Shelby.
- Max.

616
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:40,078
It's all right, don't get up.

617
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:43,198
Oh. Sorry, sorry, sir.

618
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:48,797
You knew I'm Mr Shelby?

619
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,155
Hello, sir.

620
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,960
I haven't taken time
to introduce myself.

621
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,189
Antonio.

622
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:02,072
What have you done that's so wrong, eh?

623
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:04,840
Excuse me?

624
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:07,480
Sous chef, peeling potatoes?

625
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,071
It's an emergency, late notice.

626
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:15,480
Oh, late notice.

627
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,750
All right.

628
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:20,672
All right, carry on.

629
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:29,560
Antonio...

630
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:33,038
Here, £10.

631
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,519
For the late notice.

632
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:16,496
You wanted to know
if my guests would arrive

633
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:18,796
before or after the King's speech.

634
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:24,238
- Eh?
- Yeah.

635
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:28,592
It'll be after.

636
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,112
How are you?

637
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,760
Just... worried about tomorrow.

638
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:45,793
Yeah, I'm worried about Antonio.

639
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:54,957
He's been here two months
and we've not met before, it's my fault.

640
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:56,870
I've been busy.

641
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:00,193
Thomas Shelby.

642
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:05,476
- My hand has blood.
- Oh, mine too.

643
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:12,669
Hey, how much do you pay Antonio?

644
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,119
I forget.

645
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,157
Must be a lot.

646
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:20,799
I just gave him £10,

647
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,319
didn't mean a fucking thing to him.

648
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,195
Maybe it isn't you that pays him.

649
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:43,840
I've been reading up on you.

650
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,436
Bertorelli, Claridge's.

651
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,558
You used to work in a place
called San Marco's.

652
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,434
On.

653
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,436
On Fleet Street.

654
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:00,477
I used to know the man
that owns San Marco's.

655
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,149
A man called Darby Sabini?

656
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:07,079
- I've never met him.
- No.

657
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:10,671
Maybe your, um, assistant

658
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,592
Antonio, maybe he's met him.

659
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:18,077
Here's how it is.

660
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:20,800
- Antonio was sent from New York?
- I don't know, please.

661
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:22,639
Darby Sabini facilitated.

662
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:25,189
He passed him onto you,
told you to bring him into my house,

663
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,351
threatened to kill you
if you didn't do it.

664
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,176
Do you want me to dress you
like you dressed that fucking stag?

665
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,714
Please, don't...

666
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,154
- You know about me?
- Mmm-mmm.

667
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:39,432
All right.

668
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,398
- You know what I do?
- Mmm.

669
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:44,856
You wanted to know
when my guests would arrive

670
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,599
'cause Antonio needed me alone.

671
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:50,238
He's an assassin,
the plan is to kill me tomorrow.

672
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:54,797
I don't know.

673
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,477
They just said bring him here.

674
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:04,398
Well, bring him here.

675
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:10,149
Antonio...

676
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:46,749
Oh.

677
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:50,195
Huh?

678
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,558
You're a black hand!

679
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,273
You're a black hand!

680
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:14,189
How many came from New York?
Eh? How many fucking came from New York?

681
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:20,911
What did he say? Is that a curse
or a number, what did he fucking say?

682
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:22,589
What did he fucking say?

683
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:24,592
- He said fuck you.
- Yeah?

684
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:39,000
Black hand means kill or be killed.

685
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,712
You go back to London,

686
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,678
you tell Darby Sabini

687
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,592
he picked the wrong side in this war.

688
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:50,920
Once we've dealt with the Americans
we're coming for him.

689
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,160
Go on, go.

690
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:55,189
Go. Oi!

691
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:58,833
You tell anyone else,
I'll come and find you.

692
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:19,914
<i>Arrow 335.</i>

693
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,600
The Hare and the Hounds pub.

694
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:31,390
Robert, yes, it's Mr Shelby.

695
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:34,594
Merry Christmas to you too.

696
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:38,872
Robert, is there a gypsy in the public
bar playing the fiddle for shillings?

697
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,473
Yes,

698
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:43,153
can you, uh,

699
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:46,153
can you tell him I need to speak
to him? Thank you.

700
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:00,320
Oh, fuck, Tom.

701
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,033
I thought your sporting days were over.

702
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:06,238
Yeah, so did I,
they keep coming back at us.

703
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:11,471
There's a black stallion in the stables,
he's invisible at night. Use him.

704
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,551
Take the body across the river
to the rough ground.

705
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,913
- Burn him?
- No. This one's a message.

706
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:21,794
Will there still be geese for dinner?

707
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:25,472
- Only if you can steal 'em on the way.
- On the way where?

708
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,479
We're going back, Johnny.

709
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:32,513
Back to Small Heath.

710
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:33,954
Back where you belong.

711
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,390
Merry Christmas,
you can keep the stallion.

712
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:42,718
Christ the fucking night.

713
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:01,954
Michael, they're coming today.
No, Michael, shut up and listen.

714
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:06,031
Gotta get everyone out,
get Polly and Ada to Charlie's Yard.

715
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:07,793
I've told Arthur but I can't reach John.

716
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:11,197
When you've dropped Polly and Ada,
go to John's place and get him out.

717
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:12,839
All right?

718
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:17,679
- Is it Christmas?
- Not just yet. But let's go, eh?

719
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:20,358
Mummy.

720
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:32,119
Come on! Move.

721
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,153
Hello?

722
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,632
Oh, fuck, it's you.

723
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,677
Got nothing better to do
on Christmas morning?

724
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:01,116
Tommy wants everybody
at Charlie's Yard now, come on.

725
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:03,555
Get in! Get in!

726
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,752
What's gonna happen, mate,
it's fucking Christmas.

727
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,476
Look, John, we don't have time for this.

728
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:11,720
- All right? Just come to the meeting.
- Just come in the house, have some food.

729
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,354
- Hey.
- Tell Tommy Shelby

730
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:15,456
we can look after ourselves.

731
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:16,976
Tommy says that
they could come for us today.

732
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Tommy says, Tommy says.
Are you his fucking parrot?

733
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:20,480
Look, it's the Mafia, all right?

734
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:23,151
This is the New York Mafia
we're talking about.

735
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:25,118
And we're the Peaky fucking Blinders.

736
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:26,200
No, we're not, John.

737
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:29,310
We're not the Peaky fucking Blinders
unless we're together.

738
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:31,639
We were together in the gallows

739
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:33,274
with one man missing.

740
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:36,114
John.

741
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:38,715
John, come to the meeting.
All right? Think about the kids.

742
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,710
Come to the meeting
and if you want to leave, then fine.

743
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:44,478
No. It's Christmas day,

744
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:47,072
we're the family now,
we're staying at home.

745
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,000
- Get in the fucking house!
- Esme.

746
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:55,440
John!
