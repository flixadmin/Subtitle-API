1622
01:11:08,727 --> 01:11:11,396

it's better to feel shitty

1623
01:11:12,647 --> 01:11:14,625
from losing love than it is
to never experience love

1624
01:11:14,649 --> 01:11:16,210
and to feel nothing at all, to feel empty,

1625

for a long time.

kept them at a distance

I closed off my heart
