Hello, Lizzie, how are you?

I know your new address, Lizzie,

because it was me who bought you

Luca Changretta is coming to Birmingham.
It's our turn.

So I had to find someone
bigger than you.

00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:35,080
Now, you may know there are
two families in Brooklyn,

on the import of liquor
into New York.

389
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,840
But if they move against you
in New York,

390
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,240
they'll start a war
between the families.

391
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:49,840
But if you were to die in a vendetta

00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,840
with some fucking bookmaker
in Birmingham,

393
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,840
they could take over your business
without a war.

We also contacted
a businessman in Chicago.

He's also interested in moving into
the liquor business in New York.

from New York, they're all dead,

that for business reasons
or in bad blood,

475

I would kill you.

I have no business reasons.

It seems you have retired.

is it, Tommy?

-Yeah.
-Right. Yeah.

-No.

Right then. Well, his name is Cyril

484
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,560
and he'll be very upset
and distressed,

485
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,400
so you'll need to find him someone.

-You're not armed?
-No.
