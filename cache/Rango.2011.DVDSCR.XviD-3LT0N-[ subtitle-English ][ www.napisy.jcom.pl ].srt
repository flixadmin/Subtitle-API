2
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,704
Rango! Rango!

3
00:01:10,507 --> 00:01:11,267
Rango!

4
00:01:13,788 --> 00:01:17,550
We are gathered here today
to immortalize in song

5
00:01:17,585 --> 00:01:21,278
the life and untimely death
of a great legend.

6
00:01:21,313 --> 00:01:27,075
So sit back, relax, and enjoy your low
calorie popcorn and assorted confections,

7
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:32,237
while we tell you the strange and
bewildering tale of a hero

8
00:01:32,272 --> 00:01:36,040
who has yet to enter his own story

9
00:01:45,765 --> 00:01:50,007
Hmmm. Hmmmaoh. Muh. Mmmuh!
Mmmmuh! Hmmmuh!

10
00:01:50,206 --> 00:01:53,729
Crunchy-creamy-coky-candle
- cupcake.

11
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:57,210
Okay, everybody!
Let's take it from the top.

12
00:01:58,171 --> 00:02:01,539
The stage is set. The night
moist with apprehension.

13
00:02:01,574 --> 00:02:06,175
Alone in her chamber, the princess
prepares to take her own life.

14
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:10,297
It is far better to nourish
worms than to live without love!

15
00:02:10,332 --> 00:02:12,343
She reaches for
the poison chalice.

16
00:02:12,378 --> 00:02:16,101
Meanwhile, the wicked Malvolio
plots his ascension to the throne.

17
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,582
While her aging father
lies gravely ill.

18
00:02:18,902 --> 00:02:21,423
Yes, I'm gravely ill...

19
00:02:22,104 --> 00:02:24,549
Hark, who goes there?

20
00:02:24,584 --> 00:02:27,151
It is I!
The much anticipated hero

21
00:02:27,186 --> 00:02:30,112
returning to rescue
his emotionally unstable maiden.

22
00:02:30,147 --> 00:02:35,951
Unhand her you jailers of virtue or
taste the bitter sting of my vengeance!

23
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:39,352
The sting of my... the...

24
00:02:40,513 --> 00:02:44,674
Doctor Marks? Doctor Marks,
I'm not getting anything from you!

25
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:48,917
People, we've talked about this!
Acting is reacting.

26
00:02:48,952 --> 00:02:51,438
Victor, you were wooden!
There, I said it.

27
00:02:51,473 --> 00:02:53,440
Mister Tims, you were good.

28
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,681
Perhaps a little too good!

29
00:02:57,002 --> 00:03:01,049
What's that, Victor? My character's
undefined? That's absurd!

30
00:03:01,084 --> 00:03:05,886
I know who I am. I'm thee...
I'm the guy! The protagonist, the hero!

31
00:03:05,921 --> 00:03:08,333
Every story needs a hero!

32
00:03:08,368 --> 00:03:14,171
I mean, who else is better qualified to bask
in the adulation of his numerous companions!

33
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:38,583
The stage is waiting.
The audience thirsts for adventure.

34
00:03:40,544 --> 00:03:42,184
Who am I?

35
00:03:42,985 --> 00:03:45,191
I could be anyone!

36
00:03:45,226 --> 00:03:49,068
I... I could be the sea captain
returning from a mighty voyage,

37
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:52,030
to reclaim his mechanical arm!

38
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:57,793
Or the rogue anthropologist,
battling pythons down in the Congo!

39
00:03:57,828 --> 00:03:59,674
Down, Chunga!

40
00:03:59,994 --> 00:04:07,317
And if you desire romance, I will become
the greatest lover the world has ever known!

41
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:11,039
Hola!

42
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:18,083
I couldn't help but notice
you noticing me noticing you.

43
00:04:18,118 --> 00:04:22,125
You know the womens find me
uncomfortably good looking.

44
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,967
But you seem remarkably at ease.

45
00:04:25,002 --> 00:04:27,093
Oh, stop it!
No, really...

46
00:04:27,128 --> 00:04:29,688
Well, if you must!
Ha ha! What are you doing?

47
00:04:29,723 --> 00:04:31,850
Oh! That tickles!
Are those real?

48
00:04:32,531 --> 00:04:37,733
That's it! Conflict! Victor, you
were right! I have been undefined!

49
00:04:38,213 --> 00:04:43,016
People, I've had an epiphany!
The hero cannot exist in a vacuum!

50
00:04:43,051 --> 00:04:46,697
What our story needs is
an ironic, unexpected event,

51
00:04:47,138 --> 00:04:49,859
that will propel the hero into conflict.

52
00:05:44,905 --> 00:05:46,306
Mister Tims?

53
00:06:20,144 --> 00:06:22,025
...oye...

54
00:06:27,068 --> 00:06:29,429
That's right! You!

55
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:33,851
Don't be shy. Come on.
Is okay.

56
00:06:33,886 --> 00:06:37,073
That's it,
a little closer...

57
00:06:38,313 --> 00:06:39,833
Ah. Good.

58
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:41,874
I won't bite you.

59
00:06:44,076 --> 00:06:46,237
I need a little help here.

60
00:06:46,917 --> 00:06:48,484
Uh... are you okay?

61
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:51,360
I must get to the other side.

62
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,207
The other side? You mean just now
that was you crossing the road?

63
00:06:54,242 --> 00:07:01,205
That's why... Why did you do that?!
- This is my quest. He waits for me.

64
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,810
Whe... What... Who?

65
00:07:02,845 --> 00:07:05,332
The Spirit of the West, amigo.
The One.

66
00:07:05,367 --> 00:07:10,929
They say he rides an alabaster carriage
with golden guardians to protect him.

67
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:12,856
Wha...
What are you talking about?

68
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:16,453
Enlightenment.
We are nothing without it.

69
00:07:16,893 --> 00:07:19,940
Nothing?! Your delusional quest
just ruined my life!

70
00:07:19,975 --> 00:07:25,538
I had an incredibly complex social network!
Highly sophisticated friends! I was very popular!

71
00:07:25,573 --> 00:07:32,621
Friends? I don't see no friends. - Well,
uhm... - You are a very lonely lizard.

72
00:07:34,141 --> 00:07:37,523
Now... Help me up, and I'll
help you find what you seek.

73
00:07:37,558 --> 00:07:40,894
Uhh... You will? - Quickly now.
I must get back to my quest.

74
00:07:40,929 --> 00:07:44,230
You mean, you've done this before?
- O, yes. Many times.

75
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:47,952
Come, come. - Argh... - That'sit.
Pull my finger.

76
00:07:47,987 --> 00:07:50,554
Uhh... - The Spirit is
waiting for me!

77
00:07:50,589 --> 00:07:51,674
Okay, okay...

78
00:07:58,397 --> 00:08:01,720
Okay! That's not gonna work.
- I must get to the other side.

79
00:08:01,755 --> 00:08:05,240
Why don't you just wait
until there are no cars coming?

80
00:08:05,275 --> 00:08:07,070
Is not so easy as it looks...

81
00:08:07,105 --> 00:08:08,116
A what?

82
00:08:08,151 --> 00:08:09,832
Is a metaphore.

83
00:08:40,094 --> 00:08:41,494
Hey, there's another one!

84
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,360
I knew it!

85
00:08:55,316 --> 00:08:57,321
You need a little help,
amigo?

86
00:08:57,356 --> 00:09:02,924
I think the metaphore broke my spleen.

87
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,640
- The path to knowledge
is fraught with consequence.

88
00:09:05,675 --> 00:09:05,965
Yeah... I'm just lookog for
the path to water.

89
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,563
If you want to find water,
you must first find dirt.

90
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:13,324
Dirt?

91
00:09:13,924 --> 00:09:16,331
Destiny, she is kind to you.

92
00:09:16,366 --> 00:09:19,728
Tomorrow is Wednesday,
the water comes.

93
00:09:20,248 --> 00:09:24,330
At noon the towns people gather
for a mysterious ritual...

94
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:28,252
Wow! What uhhh... a town? Like
with real people and everything?

95
00:09:28,287 --> 00:09:32,854
Where? - A days journey.
Follow your shadow.

96
00:09:33,935 --> 00:09:38,697
You want me to just walk out
into the desert?

97
00:09:38,732 --> 00:09:39,783
Uhumm... Tha's the way.

98
00:09:39,818 --> 00:09:44,740
Okay. So you're saying there's a town,
a real town? Not a metaphor town?

99
00:09:44,775 --> 00:09:46,461
Go on.
It's okay.

100
00:09:46,902 --> 00:09:50,303
Okay. Well, then I'm going.

101
00:09:50,624 --> 00:09:53,905
I am leaving the road
- now!

102
00:09:54,145 --> 00:09:57,713
I'm walking... into...
the desert!

103
00:09:57,748 --> 00:10:01,870
Alone!
- We all have our journeys to make!

104
00:10:01,905 --> 00:10:04,214
I will see you on the other side...

105
00:10:18,261 --> 00:10:24,945
Welcome, amigo,
to the land without end,

106
00:10:25,384 --> 00:10:31,827
The desert and death are
the closest of friends...

107
00:10:32,028 --> 00:10:38,371
we sing of his courage
in this gleeful sung song,

108
00:10:38,406 --> 00:10:44,715
Better pay close attetnion,
he won't be here long...

109
00:11:03,564 --> 00:11:08,487
Here in the Mojave desert, animals
have had millions of years to adapt

110
00:11:08,522 --> 00:11:11,252
to the harsh environment.

111
00:11:11,287 --> 00:11:14,773
But the lizard, he is going to die.

112
00:11:14,808 --> 00:11:19,730
Four score and seven years ago...
Our fathers... - Don't move!

113
00:11:19,765 --> 00:11:20,891
What?

114
00:11:26,374 --> 00:11:28,421
Don't move!
- I'm not moving!

115
00:11:28,456 --> 00:11:31,461
I'm not moving.
- Try to blend in.

116
00:11:31,496 --> 00:11:33,498
What? Blend in?
Wha... whaaa... what do you mean?

117
00:11:37,059 --> 00:11:38,546
Blend in!

118
00:11:38,581 --> 00:11:40,140
Huh? Wh.. wha... wha...
what are you saying?

119
00:11:41,902 --> 00:11:46,144
Too late. - No! No! It's not too late!
I.. I'm blending! I'm a blender!

120
00:11:46,179 --> 00:11:49,626
Calm down!
What are you doing?

121
00:11:51,266 --> 00:11:52,988
Don't move!

122
00:11:53,227 --> 00:11:55,069
Try not to look conspicuous.

123
00:12:03,273 --> 00:12:05,639
Hey, pst!
Whad'ya doing?

124
00:12:05,674 --> 00:12:07,255
I'm blending.
- Go and blend somewhere else.

125
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:08,801
Don't distract me!
- No room at the inn!

126
00:12:08,836 --> 00:12:12,097
It's an art not a science!
- Find your own hiding place!

127
00:12:12,132 --> 00:12:15,324
This is good. - Oh, here she comes!
You better run, Mojito!

128
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:19,081
What? But you said "don't move".
- That was before. Now... you run!

129
00:12:21,402 --> 00:12:23,123
Adios, amigo.

130
00:13:06,157 --> 00:13:08,117
Oh, hey!
Where's your basket?

131
00:13:08,438 --> 00:13:10,079
Oh, thirsty?

132
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:27,207
Please! Please don't! Please don't!
I have vertigo! My glands are swollen!

133
00:13:27,728 --> 00:13:29,689
Please, no...

134
00:13:35,122 --> 00:13:37,168
Hey... Madre de Dios!

135
00:13:37,203 --> 00:13:41,771
You! I kill you, you stupid lizard
Get out of there!

136
00:13:41,806 --> 00:13:44,087
I can't help but taste the days
of action! - Oh just shut up and shoot!

137
00:13:45,047 --> 00:13:48,209
No, wait! Come back!
I was just kidding!

138
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:51,336
We friends, hey?
- I... I don't know you.

139
00:13:51,371 --> 00:13:53,613
Lizards, frogs... - Move over!
- We' practically related!

140
00:13:53,648 --> 00:13:58,054
Move over! - I let you
kiss my sister!

141
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:09,419
You son of a...

142
00:15:03,767 --> 00:15:07,049
Where are your friends
now, amigo?

143
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,069
Heeeeeeeelp!

144
00:15:35,126 --> 00:15:38,729
Get your slimy,
webbed phalanges off my boots!

145
00:15:39,929 --> 00:15:43,612
Oh! Uh... sorry! - I got a beat on you,
stranger. You get up real slow.

146
00:15:43,647 --> 00:15:47,212
Or you wanna spend your afternoon
pickin' your face back together!

147
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:48,931
No, no, no, no, ma'm,
I don't...

148
00:15:48,966 --> 00:15:50,581
Who are you?
- Whhhoo... am I?

149
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:56,738
I'm askin' the questions here!
We're in the middle of a drought

150
00:15:56,773 --> 00:15:56,784
now someone's dumping
water in the desert.

151
00:15:56,819 --> 00:15:58,239
Now I suppose it's indeterminable s
omethin' to mention

152
00:15:58,274 --> 00:15:59,660
but I intend to find out
what role you play in all this.

153
00:15:59,695 --> 00:16:00,706
Role? - What are you involved in?

154
00:16:00,741 --> 00:16:05,423
Oh! Well, I... I'm glad you asked. I've got
two one acts, a mystery and a musical

155
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:06,508
I've been gestating.

156
00:16:06,543 --> 00:16:09,025
I've got the words. I'm just kinda
workin' on the melody. It's like a...

157
00:16:10,786 --> 00:16:12,187
It's... I think it's gonna be
a western.

158
00:16:16,589 --> 00:16:18,190
Hey, monkey got a cracker... Hmhmhm
His mother's making supper.. La-la-la-la...

159
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:22,791
You ain't from round here,
are you?

160
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:30,063
I.. I'm... I'm still workin' on it.

161
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:33,549
Uh... so, what's your name?

162
00:16:33,584 --> 00:16:35,630
Beans.
- That's a funny kind of name.

163
00:16:35,665 --> 00:16:37,365
What can I say, my daddy
plum loved baked beans.

164
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,066
Well, you're lucky
he didn't plum love asparagus.

165
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:43,001
What... what are you sayin'? - I mean,
I... I enjoy a hearty puttanesca myself,

166
00:16:43,036 --> 00:16:46,967
but I'm not sure that the child uh...
would appreciate the moniker.

167
00:16:47,002 --> 00:16:50,284
My daddy was a fine man. Even if he
did exibit proclivity for lagoons... - Hm, spicey.

168
00:16:53,806 --> 00:16:57,333
You're eating his ashes!
- Uh. You carry his remains?

169
00:16:57,368 --> 00:16:58,448
No! His ashes. He loved to smoke.
They never found the body.

170
00:16:58,483 --> 00:17:00,547
Oh! Well, I'm sure he had his reasons.

171
00:17:00,582 --> 00:17:01,142
What are you implyin'?
- Nothing. I...

172
00:17:01,177 --> 00:17:01,667
Oh! Well, I'm sure
he had his reasons.

173
00:17:01,702 --> 00:17:06,504
My daddy was never near that mine shaft.
He'd been sober for over a month.

174
00:17:06,539 --> 00:17:11,307
And for you to insinuate that he would
abandon his parental responsibilities

175
00:17:11,342 --> 00:17:12,388
at a delicate time in my personal
development is an up front to my

176
00:17:20,031 --> 00:17:21,438
Miss Beans?

177
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:24,194
Miss Beans?
Hello?

178
00:17:25,755 --> 00:17:28,036
Hee-lo?

179
00:17:42,869 --> 00:17:46,030
...and I'm telling to people that "Adndromeda 5"
will return safe and sound

180
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,472
and I will not sell my ranch!

181
00:17:48,992 --> 00:17:51,714
What? - What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

182
00:17:51,749 --> 00:17:53,752
What am I doing?
- You... were cuddling me.

183
00:17:53,787 --> 00:17:55,720
We... well went frozen.
- No I didn't...

184
00:17:55,755 --> 00:17:59,202
Yes. You stopped talking.
- That's defence mechanism.

185
00:17:59,237 --> 00:18:01,999
Actually lots of people have it.
- Now you've made that up!

186
00:18:03,585 --> 00:18:05,466
So, you're gonna die out here
or you wanna a ride into town?

187
00:18:05,787 --> 00:18:08,388
No! No!. No! Uh... Yeah! No!
Yeas please! Thank you.

188
00:18:08,748 --> 00:18:14,390
Today's Wednesday. - Wednesday?
- When we all get to it. So who are you really?

189
00:18:15,591 --> 00:18:17,757
Well, I'm a man of many epithets.

190
00:18:17,792 --> 00:18:21,195
There's my stage name, my pen name,
my avatar. Had a pseudonym once, but had to...

191
00:18:21,835 --> 00:18:25,197
And so the stranger
seeking companionship

192
00:18:25,757 --> 00:18:30,119
finds a woman. Much like
the sirens of the ancient times

193
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,886
luring him to his certain demise.

194
00:18:34,921 --> 00:18:38,603
...and I'm actually of the few men
with the maiden name!

195
00:18:38,638 --> 00:18:40,445
Whow! Here we are.

196
00:18:46,764 --> 00:18:53,448
Oh, oh, right. Well, I sure do appreciate it,
Miss Beans, and if there's anything I could...

197
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:58,970
See ya,
Beans.

198
00:19:06,734 --> 00:19:09,136
WELCOME TO "DIRT"
- w_anna 2001-

199
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:18,341
Your're leaving us, Jim?
- Well, we gave it up on that shop.

200
00:19:18,376 --> 00:19:22,903
Gotta sell it. Can't roll
no crowd for I got no water.

201
00:19:25,922 --> 00:19:27,003
Bye!

202
00:19:32,329 --> 00:19:33,970
What is it?

203
00:19:36,701 --> 00:19:39,783
What was that for?
- You're funny looking.

204
00:19:40,223 --> 00:19:43,064
Well, you're funny looking too!
- That's a funny looking shirt!

205
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:45,905
That's a funny looking dress!
- You got funny looking eyes!

206
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,505
You gotta funny looking face!

207
00:19:48,506 --> 00:19:51,565
You're a stranger.
Strangers don't last long here.

208
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:57,051
Here's your beans, Beans. - I'm
gonna need some more feed, too, Willie.

209
00:19:57,086 --> 00:20:01,313
Well you almost got three corts already.
I can't give you no more credits.

210
00:20:01,348 --> 00:20:03,436
But I have what I owe you
at noon.

211
00:20:03,471 --> 00:20:09,294
You don't understand. It's Mr.
Merrymack from the bank, he cut off all credits.

212
00:20:09,329 --> 00:20:10,414
Hey, Beans?

213
00:20:10,816 --> 00:20:15,097
You know that there fella?
- Beans? Miss Beans?

214
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:16,418
Nope. - Hey, Beans...

215
00:20:17,578 --> 00:20:18,258
Hey...

216
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:24,342
Oh. Right! Blend in!

217
00:21:55,491 --> 00:21:58,212
I'd like a... glass of water?

218
00:21:59,854 --> 00:22:02,015
He wants a glass of water!

219
00:22:02,455 --> 00:22:05,857
Make it a double!
- Give him two!

220
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:11,669
Cactus juice.
That's all we got.

221
00:22:36,795 --> 00:22:42,045
Hey, Fruitcup? You are
a long way from home, ain't ya?

222
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,567
Who exactly are you?

223
00:22:48,928 --> 00:22:50,889
Who am I?

224
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:54,211
I could be anyone.

225
00:22:54,246 --> 00:22:56,452
HECHO IN: DURANGO

226
00:22:57,333 --> 00:23:01,455
What's the matter? Your miss
your mamma's mangos?

227
00:23:02,456 --> 00:23:04,736
As a matter of fact, I am.

228
00:23:05,537 --> 00:23:09,339
But not as much as your
daddy's cooking!

229
00:23:09,374 --> 00:23:13,141
Exactly... where did you say
you were from?

230
00:23:13,176 --> 00:23:16,628
Me? I'm from the West.

231
00:23:16,663 --> 00:23:20,785
Out there, beyond the horizon.
Pass the sunset.

232
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:22,786
The Far west...

233
00:23:24,587 --> 00:23:26,313
Yea, that's right hombres.

234
00:23:26,348 --> 00:23:31,511
The place I come from, we kill a man
before breakfast, just to work up an appetite.

235
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:36,152
We salt him and we pepper him,
we braise him clarified butter

236
00:23:36,187 --> 00:23:38,679
and then we eat him.

237
00:23:38,714 --> 00:23:40,760
You eat him?
- That's what I said!

238
00:23:40,795 --> 00:23:45,158
Hell, I've seen things make a grown man
lose control of his glandular function.

239
00:23:45,193 --> 00:23:48,318
You spend three days in a horse
carcass, livin' off you own juices.

240
00:23:48,353 --> 00:23:51,480
It'll change a man!
Oh, yes.

241
00:23:53,642 --> 00:23:58,564
Have a few extra aces in this deck, yea?
Just the way I like it.

242
00:23:59,444 --> 00:24:03,566
So no, my hair shootin' rodent little friend,
I am not from around these parts.

243
00:24:03,927 --> 00:24:05,647
You might say I'm from everywhere

244
00:24:06,088 --> 00:24:08,609
there's trouble brewin'
and hell waiting to be raised.

245
00:24:09,049 --> 00:24:11,971
You might say I'm
what hell's already raised up!

246
00:24:13,092 --> 00:24:15,880
Name's...
Rango.

247
00:24:21,056 --> 00:24:23,456
Are you that fella that
killed them Jenkins brothers?

248
00:24:23,491 --> 00:24:26,939
Aha, killed them with one bullet.

249
00:24:26,974 --> 00:24:29,197
Don't get no deader.

250
00:24:29,232 --> 00:24:31,421
All seven of 'em?

251
00:24:32,062 --> 00:24:33,822
That's right.

252
00:24:34,143 --> 00:24:35,783
All sven of them.

253
00:24:36,744 --> 00:24:41,297
Exactly how did you do that,
Mr. Rango?

254
00:24:42,182 --> 00:24:46,304
Y'know I'm glad you asked me that.
And... I would be happy to tell you!

255
00:24:46,339 --> 00:24:49,029
But you all gotta have to
listen up,

256
00:24:49,064 --> 00:24:54,188
because this is where it gets...
complicated.

257
00:24:55,908 --> 00:24:59,370
I'm about to close the account, Mrs. Goats -
two go to the swig.

258
00:24:59,405 --> 00:25:02,832
Hands off, Mordekao, that's what
swept off your college education!

259
00:25:04,793 --> 00:25:07,239
I don't have any other choice, Beans.

260
00:25:07,274 --> 00:25:10,567
Times being so hard, we...
we just can't give no more credit.

261
00:25:10,602 --> 00:25:13,860
But this here is a bank!
This is where you keep the water.

262
00:25:14,421 --> 00:25:15,501
Keep the wate..

263
00:25:17,062 --> 00:25:22,117
Beans, you've been like a niece to me.
Ever since your daddy...

264
00:25:22,984 --> 00:25:26,867
did NOT fall drunk down a mine shaft.
And uh... I've...

265
00:25:27,547 --> 00:25:31,710
I've tried to protect you and others
from certain realities.

266
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:34,551
Oh... the weight of them realities...
- G. Merrymack?

267
00:25:35,592 --> 00:25:36,712
G. Merrymack?

268
00:25:37,712 --> 00:25:39,513
Are you all right?

269
00:25:40,114 --> 00:25:42,835
Beans, I need to
sh... show you something.

270
00:25:51,439 --> 00:25:54,600
That's all that's left?
- And this here is the reserve!

271
00:25:55,161 --> 00:26:00,044
I don't know if you've noticed, but folks just
ain't makin' deposits on a Wednesday no more.

272
00:26:01,365 --> 00:26:03,645
If I don't get some water
I'm gonna lose my ranch,

273
00:26:04,086 --> 00:26:06,248
and you're tellin' me that's all
that's left in the whole tank!

274
00:26:06,283 --> 00:26:08,646
Now, that just don't
make no sense.

275
00:26:08,681 --> 00:26:12,723
Now, listen. Someone is
dumpin' water in the desert.

276
00:26:13,163 --> 00:26:16,085
I've seen it with my own eyes!

277
00:26:17,966 --> 00:26:22,969
Water in the desert! Was this durin'
one of your... special times?

278
00:26:23,004 --> 00:26:28,131
No! - Well, we can all dream.
But this is the reality.

279
00:26:28,571 --> 00:26:32,253
Why do you think so many people
are sellin' out? They just can't make it.

280
00:26:32,734 --> 00:26:34,854
Well... I... what am I supposed to do?

281
00:26:36,536 --> 00:26:38,257
Well, I suppose we could talk to the Mayor.

282
00:26:38,576 --> 00:26:40,777
I hear he's been helpin'
people out in this time of crisis.

283
00:26:43,499 --> 00:26:44,820
The Mayor?
- He may be... our only hope.

284
00:26:45,341 --> 00:26:48,302
...bullet hits the shovel, richochets back
towards number three

285
00:26:48,742 --> 00:26:51,783
and that's where the roof gave in
ingiting with a pure green alcohol

286
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:54,625
instantly vaporized his bodily form
into nothing but

287
00:26:54,985 --> 00:26:58,708
a charcoal statute
and high-ptiched squeel.

288
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:07,511
Ho-hold on there. That's only six.
What happend to number seven?

289
00:27:10,491 --> 00:27:14,238
Number seven? Damn...
Died of infection.

290
00:27:17,775 --> 00:27:20,735
One bullet...

291
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:21,970
All seven men.

292
00:27:22,005 --> 00:27:26,488
Dance for me!
Dance like a real chicken!

293
00:27:26,523 --> 00:27:28,854
Dance, dance.

294
00:27:28,889 --> 00:27:34,011
You got coal in your ears, mate? You don't
pay the mortgage, you don't own the land!

295
00:27:35,426 --> 00:27:38,833
That's basic real estate law, my friend.
- Your broke law!

296
00:27:38,868 --> 00:27:44,071
If I see you're face in this town again
I'm gonna slice it off.

297
00:27:44,106 --> 00:27:48,313
And use it to wipe my unmentionables...
- Mind the beak.

298
00:27:49,433 --> 00:27:52,035
And don't come back!

299
00:27:53,676 --> 00:27:57,278
What are you all coping at?

300
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:03,400
Hey, Bad Bill, there's something
I gotta tell ya...

301
00:28:07,713 --> 00:28:12,515
Oi, what is this?
- You know who this is, Bill? It's Rango!

302
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:16,555
Yeah! He ain't afraid of you.
He ain't afraid of any of you.

303
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:20,560
Killed them Jenkins brothers.
- Done it with one bullet, Bill...

304
00:28:20,595 --> 00:28:22,458
All seven of them!

305
00:28:22,493 --> 00:28:24,322
Is that right...

306
00:29:02,382 --> 00:29:04,703
Lemme get that for you.

307
00:29:08,466 --> 00:29:11,306
Eh... No! I know. Here.

308
00:29:14,828 --> 00:29:18,230
Just will care 'bout that
for you...

309
00:29:18,265 --> 00:29:20,591
Here! All better!

310
00:29:44,844 --> 00:29:47,484
Here, here... just a second...

311
00:29:50,047 --> 00:29:55,089
All right, listen. I wanna give you fellas
one last chance to reconsider.

312
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:02,635
And if you don't wanna reconsider,

313
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:06,592
I might consider
reconsidering myself.

314
00:30:16,557 --> 00:30:18,798
Now, that's what I'm
talking about!

315
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:24,082
Yeah. All right now, listen up! Things
gonna be different now Rango's in town.

316
00:30:24,841 --> 00:30:29,844
Got some new rules; my shoe shined every
mornin', my coffee hot, Danish on the side.

317
00:30:30,284 --> 00:30:32,765
Whatever you do,
don't look me in the eye!

318
00:30:33,326 --> 00:30:36,168
Stay out of my peripheral vision!

319
00:30:36,813 --> 00:30:36,813
It's Rango!
- What's he up to?

320
00:30:36,848 --> 00:30:40,330
He ain't afraid of nobody! - He's gonna
turn that bird butt-forward!

321
00:30:40,365 --> 00:30:42,136
When you see me comin',
stand aside.

322
00:30:42,171 --> 00:30:47,654
I take large steps and I don't want
your hey-sees bodily fluids on my boots!

323
00:30:49,494 --> 00:30:55,938
Of course, there is no need for violence.
As long as we stick together, work as team.

324
00:30:55,973 --> 00:31:01,941
So I want you all
to come on outside, now.

325
00:31:02,701 --> 00:31:05,102
Line up single file
while I take a recreation!

326
00:31:05,137 --> 00:31:07,504
What's he doing now?
- I think it's A number two.

327
00:31:10,905 --> 00:31:12,426
OCUPADO

328
00:31:28,995 --> 00:31:30,955
Well, never mind!

329
00:31:51,447 --> 00:31:53,253
You can best see
over here!

330
00:31:53,288 --> 00:31:56,569
Look at him!
He's taking that hawk!

331
00:31:56,604 --> 00:31:58,291
Give him here, Rango!

332
00:33:51,365 --> 00:33:54,212
Did you see that?
- He killed than banger!

333
00:33:54,247 --> 00:33:59,890
What do you... what do you
say, doc? - This hawk is dead!

334
00:33:59,925 --> 00:34:02,498
Shoo. I say we'd cook that
right out!

335
00:34:02,533 --> 00:34:05,655
He did it with one bullet!
- Well just like he said!

336
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:07,937
It's about time
we had a hero around here!

337
00:34:07,972 --> 00:34:08,462
One who ain't in a pine box...

338
00:34:08,497 --> 00:34:11,419
I think it's time he met the Mayor.

339
00:34:11,618 --> 00:34:16,652
- You hear that, Rango?
You're gonna meet the Mayor.

340
00:34:16,687 --> 00:34:17,014
Let's here it for Rango!

341
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:27,482
And so the stranger basks
in the adulation of his new friends.

342
00:34:27,517 --> 00:34:32,964
Sinking deeper into the
guacamole of his own deception.

343
00:34:32,999 --> 00:34:38,008
When is he goin' to die?
- Soon, compadre. Soon.

344
00:34:53,696 --> 00:34:55,897
My land is not for sale!

345
00:34:57,098 --> 00:34:59,904
I thank you would save our land,
not sell it!

346
00:34:59,939 --> 00:35:03,861
I'm sure we'd work out something
if you just talked to him...

347
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:06,783
Beans, where're you going?
Beans!

348
00:35:07,142 --> 00:35:09,744
The Mayor will see you now.

349
00:35:14,546 --> 00:35:18,233
Water, Mr. Rango, water.

350
00:35:18,268 --> 00:35:22,071
Without it, there's nothing
but dust and decay.

351
00:35:22,106 --> 00:35:26,432
But with water... there's life.

352
00:35:27,993 --> 00:35:33,516
Look at them! They're so desperate to live
they'll follow it anywhere...

353
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:36,158
That's the immutable law
of the desert.

354
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:42,326
Control the water and
you control everything else.

355
00:35:42,361 --> 00:35:47,844
This is from my private stock.
Vintage rain water, from the Great Deluge.

356
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:52,725
Oh, not Noah's deluge.
Goodness, I'm not that old!

357
00:35:55,022 --> 00:35:59,623
I guess power has some privileges.
- You made the good point, son.

358
00:36:00,282 --> 00:36:03,723
But with privilege comes
responsibility.

359
00:36:05,203 --> 00:36:08,364
Hell, I was Mayor here before
there was the Dirt!

360
00:36:08,399 --> 00:36:11,086
I may be just a sentimental,
old turtle...

361
00:36:11,647 --> 00:36:14,568
but I think there's a future to
this town

362
00:36:14,603 --> 00:36:16,316
and I hope you'll be part of it.

363
00:36:17,316 --> 00:36:20,238
To Dirt!
- To Dirt!

364
00:36:22,959 --> 00:36:26,801
You see them, Mr. Rango?
All my friends and neighbours?

365
00:36:27,521 --> 00:36:31,688
It's a hard life here...
Very hard...

366
00:36:31,723 --> 00:36:35,525
Do you know how they make it
through each and every day?

367
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:40,328
They believe. They believe
it's going to be better.

368
00:36:40,363 --> 00:36:43,974
They believe that the water
will come!

369
00:36:44,009 --> 00:36:46,771
They believe against all odds
and all evidence

370
00:36:47,291 --> 00:36:49,172
that tomorrow will be
better than today.

371
00:36:50,893 --> 00:36:53,775
People have to believe in
something.

372
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:58,217
Right now,
they believe in you.

373
00:36:59,418 --> 00:37:01,699
Pick it up, Mr. Rango.

374
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:04,421
Your destiny awaits.

375
00:37:07,302 --> 00:37:10,744
People have to believe in
something.

376
00:37:15,986 --> 00:37:17,472
It just don't make no sense.

377
00:37:17,507 --> 00:37:21,670
This whole town is drying up
and the Mayor seems

378
00:37:21,705 --> 00:37:23,315
the only one who's not affected!

379
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:23,635
Don't that make you just
a wee bit suspicious?

380
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:28,112
What about that water I saw out
in the desert? I seen it with my own eyes!

381
00:37:28,147 --> 00:37:31,680
Alright! No need to insight anxiety.
I'll inquire about the Mayor.

382
00:37:31,715 --> 00:37:38,598
If you really feel there's some conspiracy,
I suggest you take it up with the sheriff!

383
00:37:51,235 --> 00:37:52,132
Excuse me, Mr Rango?

384
00:38:03,697 --> 00:38:07,740
I will blow that ugly right off your face!
- Uh... I was just thinkin' that uh..

385
00:38:07,775 --> 00:38:11,765
Oh! You want the old John Hancock,
do you? Well, here hold this.

386
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:15,756
This isn't a social call! - Oh,
I know all about the all dig...

387
00:38:15,791 --> 00:38:17,802
I ordered myself some
nice fancy-dandies.

388
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:20,804
G. Rango! - You too? No problems, just...
- I need you to investigate...

389
00:38:20,839 --> 00:38:23,761
You know Beans, I bet you clean up
real nice if you put a little effort into it.

390
00:38:24,202 --> 00:38:27,243
Son, stay in school, eat your veggies,
burn everything but Shakespear.

391
00:38:27,603 --> 00:38:32,365
Who... who's Shakespeare?
- Sheriff Rango! If that is your real name!

392
00:38:32,726 --> 00:38:35,687
I am tryin' to save my daddy's ranch,
which is on the verge

393
00:38:36,207 --> 00:38:38,808
of an agricultural meltdown while
you're playin' patty cake with each...

394
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:44,851
Sad girl...
Such a drabbly pain..

395
00:38:45,373 --> 00:38:46,618
Why does she do that?

396
00:38:46,653 --> 00:38:49,854
It's a survival reflex.
- 'xcept her switch is just broken.

397
00:38:49,889 --> 00:38:51,575
Well! That's an inconvenience.

398
00:38:52,015 --> 00:38:54,417
It is not a rash!
It is a birth mark.

399
00:38:55,417 --> 00:38:58,058
I did it again, didn't I?
- Did what?

400
00:38:58,459 --> 00:39:00,540
Let me ask you something...

401
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:04,583
Did anybody here mention to you
what happened to our last sheriff?

402
00:39:44,083 --> 00:39:51,086
Uh... May I ask you... the last sheriff.
Pardon me...

403
00:39:51,121 --> 00:39:54,687
Where did everybody go?
What happened to him?

404
00:40:33,827 --> 00:40:35,588
Oh... oh... I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

405
00:40:46,634 --> 00:40:50,357
his is heck of a hoedown you got goin'.
Still workin' out those steps.

406
00:40:50,392 --> 00:40:53,476
So, is this considered
normal civic behavior?

407
00:40:53,511 --> 00:40:56,560
Mmhmm. Every Wednesday.
Just like clock work.

408
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:02,002
You kill bird? - Yea, ha...
as a matter of fact, I did.

409
00:41:02,037 --> 00:41:04,609
Bird dead. Snake come.

410
00:41:04,644 --> 00:41:07,651
Is it snake? - He means
Rattlesnake Jake, Mr Rango.

411
00:41:07,686 --> 00:41:10,907
He wasn't coming to town because
he was scared of that hawk.

412
00:41:10,942 --> 00:41:14,094
but might come now. May I have
your boots when you're dead?

413
00:41:14,129 --> 00:41:18,811
No! Rango's got no problem with this Rattlesnake
Jake. - That's exactly what Amos said.

414
00:41:18,846 --> 00:41:20,371
Amos?

415
00:41:21,773 --> 00:41:23,173
Sheriff AMOS
Thursday - Friday

416
00:41:23,694 --> 00:41:25,374
You got any gold fillings?

417
00:41:44,584 --> 00:41:47,390
My fellow Dirtonians!

418
00:41:47,425 --> 00:41:53,629
I welcome you to this great day
of deliverance! Halellujah! - Halellujah!

419
00:41:54,389 --> 00:41:58,192
Acolytes, prepare
the holly spigot!

420
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:14,800
We have a newcomer amongst us,
a man I think needs little introduction

421
00:42:14,835 --> 00:42:19,082
to you, so bold has been his entry
into our fair society.

422
00:42:19,117 --> 00:42:22,003
Mr. Rango?
Would you step forward?

423
00:42:22,038 --> 00:42:24,205
Mine!
- Mine!

424
00:42:28,247 --> 00:42:33,689
The time has come! The time
that was foretold! - Hallelujah!

425
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:36,930
The sacred time!
- Hallelujah!

426
00:42:38,051 --> 00:42:41,773
The time of destiny!
- Hallelujah!

427
00:42:42,094 --> 00:42:44,815
The time of deliverance!
- Hallelujah!

428
00:42:45,575 --> 00:42:50,298
It is the time of...
hydration!

429
00:43:05,786 --> 00:43:08,627
It's his fault! - It's the newcomer!
- Burn him!

430
00:43:09,067 --> 00:43:11,308
He's a witch!
- I want his boots!

431
00:43:11,629 --> 00:43:14,695
My friends! My friends!
Temper your frustrations.

432
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:19,613
Times will be tough from now on.
Sacrifices have to be made.

433
00:43:19,853 --> 00:43:23,895
But if I can help in any way,
please know that my door is always...

434
00:43:24,215 --> 00:43:28,017
Hold it! hold it! Now this whole
thing stinks three ways to Sunday!

435
00:43:28,256 --> 00:43:31,058
First the bank's run dry,
and now this here spigot!

436
00:43:31,418 --> 00:43:32,939
Bank's run dry?
- What's she talkin' about?

437
00:43:33,379 --> 00:43:35,460
She said there's no
water in the bank!

438
00:43:38,262 --> 00:43:39,943
I want mine in cash!

439
00:43:41,544 --> 00:43:44,625
We can't just give away...
- We can't move again!

440
00:43:47,027 --> 00:43:51,509
There'll be no civil disobedience
in my town. Thank you very much!

441
00:43:53,669 --> 00:43:56,351
Thank Goodness you're here, sheriff.
Things were getting outta hand!

442
00:43:56,386 --> 00:43:57,791
Ooo... come right in,
join us.

443
00:43:58,312 --> 00:44:03,075
Well now! Let me get the source
of the societal discontentment here.

444
00:44:03,995 --> 00:44:06,676
Go.. ho... hod, have mercy...

445
00:44:07,596 --> 00:44:11,518
All right. Listen up! I've been thinkin'
and I believe I figured somethin' out.

446
00:44:11,918 --> 00:44:15,001
You folks have a water problem!

447
00:44:16,521 --> 00:44:19,243
Now, just pay attention everybody!
I'm tryin' to make a point here.

448
00:44:19,683 --> 00:44:22,124
Let's say this fella here were
to take a drink of water.

449
00:44:22,524 --> 00:44:25,286
Just one little drink.
No harm, no foul. Right?

450
00:44:27,886 --> 00:44:32,330
And you! Why you're just as dried up
and parched as a Jack rabbit in July!

451
00:44:32,365 --> 00:44:35,211
So you belly on up and
take you a double shot!

452
00:44:36,691 --> 00:44:38,653
Stay with me...

453
00:44:39,333 --> 00:44:41,734
What do you think happens then?
Why we'd all be drinkin'!

454
00:44:41,769 --> 00:44:46,976
Before you know it,
there wouldn't be anymore water!

455
00:44:47,011 --> 00:44:49,298
And then where would we be?

456
00:44:50,459 --> 00:44:54,585
We'd be thirsty!
Real thirsty!

457
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:57,662
Why we'd turn on each other
like a bunch of animals!

458
00:44:59,983 --> 00:45:05,547
Now, look here. We have got
six days of water...

459
00:45:09,669 --> 00:45:12,830
Fi.. - We have got five
days of water.

460
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:18,833
As long as we got water,
we got ourselves a town.

461
00:45:20,290 --> 00:45:24,652
Sheriff Rango is right. As long
as we have this water, we have some hope.

462
00:45:25,052 --> 00:45:27,894
And you can all take it from me.
My one hundred percent

463
00:45:28,453 --> 00:45:33,697
full time employment from this moment
I'll protect our precious, natural, resource.

464
00:45:36,178 --> 00:45:38,699
Ain't no one gonna tango
with the Rango!

465
00:45:51,146 --> 00:45:53,106
Good evening, ladies.
- Good evening, sheriff.

466
00:45:54,227 --> 00:45:58,030
Hold on their, Gordy. Now you
get on back in there and assert yourself.

467
00:45:58,349 --> 00:46:04,112
I think you'll find the people in this
town to be surprising hospitable.

468
00:46:04,147 --> 00:46:05,313
Thank you, sheriff!

469
00:46:05,348 --> 00:46:07,154
What? Not you!

470
00:46:08,155 --> 00:46:10,275
I stand corrected.

471
00:46:16,239 --> 00:46:18,920
This ain't the bank!
- Hold you, Jedidiah!

472
00:46:18,955 --> 00:46:21,418
Hold it right there!
- It's the sheriff.

473
00:46:21,453 --> 00:46:23,847
Get them hands up
where I can see 'em.

474
00:46:23,882 --> 00:46:29,326
Just as I suspected. Prospecting
without authorized equipment!

475
00:46:29,685 --> 00:46:31,647
Don't move a muscle!
- Prospectors?

476
00:46:35,127 --> 00:46:39,611
Now, here's the shovels, pickaxe, drills,
some snacks, puzzle works

477
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:42,452
and you gonna need the permit.

478
00:46:43,211 --> 00:46:45,813
Ezekiel! Jedidiah! What the
Sam hill's goin' on up there?

479
00:46:45,848 --> 00:46:49,535
I've had colobs removed
smarter than the two of you!

480
00:46:49,736 --> 00:46:54,898
Hells bar! This ain't the bank! - Pappy,
the Sheriff is standin' right here!

481
00:46:54,933 --> 00:46:58,585
Helpin' us out.
- Gonna give us a permit for prospecting.

482
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:01,662
That's right, sir. Just doin' my duty.
The lonely constable on his rounds,

483
00:47:01,982 --> 00:47:06,905
keepin' and eagle eye out
for meyham and malfeasance.

484
00:47:07,104 --> 00:47:09,706
Does he look like he sounds?
- Uhum.

485
00:47:10,506 --> 00:47:16,509
If we was to hit the mother load,
being prospectors and such,

486
00:47:16,544 --> 00:47:19,836
where would we deposit said annuity?

487
00:47:19,871 --> 00:47:25,353
Well, in Dirt we happen to have the finest
financial institution this side of Missouri.

488
00:47:26,434 --> 00:47:29,595
Protected mornin', noon and night
by yours truly.

489
00:47:31,117 --> 00:47:33,122
Much obliged.

490
00:47:33,157 --> 00:47:36,359
The bank's been robbed!
The bank's been robbed!

491
00:47:36,394 --> 00:47:39,001
O, God Lord,
the bank's been robbed!

492
00:47:39,201 --> 00:47:41,843
What's goin' on?
- I don't know. The water is gone!

493
00:47:41,878 --> 00:47:44,084
What's he sayin'?
- The bank's been robbed!

494
00:47:44,443 --> 00:47:48,006
Doctor Marks, I'm on fire,
embrace me!

495
00:47:48,606 --> 00:47:51,334
The bank's been robbed,
the town is striked...

496
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:56,172
to die of thirst or equal,
what they thought is all his fault

497
00:47:56,572 --> 00:48:00,174
All right folks, stand back, clear
the area, this is a crime scene now.

498
00:48:00,209 --> 00:48:03,016
Secure the perimeter, dust for prints
and fiber, scamper DNA

499
00:48:04,112 --> 00:48:07,073
I wanna urin sample from everyone
and get me a latte.

500
00:48:07,108 --> 00:48:08,639
Don't mix up the two...

501
00:48:08,674 --> 00:48:13,316
What's this? Prospecting permit?
- I'll take that. Material evidence!

502
00:48:13,351 --> 00:48:16,203
What are we doin' now, sheriff?
- We need that water.

503
00:48:16,238 --> 00:48:21,480
We're all gonna die! - Friends,
we all know what we have to do.

504
00:48:21,515 --> 00:48:25,322
That's right. We all know
what we have to do now.

505
00:48:25,357 --> 00:48:27,328
And that would be?

506
00:48:27,363 --> 00:48:29,964
(Form a posse).
- Form a possum"!

507
00:48:31,846 --> 00:48:33,806
A posse.

508
00:48:34,807 --> 00:48:38,053
Now we gonna be doing this
in orderly fashion.

509
00:48:38,088 --> 00:48:43,932
First of all, does anybody here know
how to use a firearm of any kind?

510
00:48:45,933 --> 00:48:47,539
All right then.

511
00:48:47,574 --> 00:48:49,335
What do we do now,
sheriff?

512
00:48:50,294 --> 00:48:52,896
Now,...
we ride.

513
00:49:05,405 --> 00:49:08,568
Where're we going?
- What?

514
00:49:09,008 --> 00:49:11,408
Where're we going?

515
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:21,583
Now, as my deputy you'll be in charge
of all trackin' and findin' of villains.

516
00:49:22,023 --> 00:49:24,744
Utilizin" your well developed ingenuity.
No offense taken.

517
00:49:25,184 --> 00:49:27,305
So which way do you think they went?
You wanna sniff the air...

518
00:49:27,625 --> 00:49:30,226
or commune
with a buffalo or somethin'?

519
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:34,628
Oh... you're good!

520
00:49:36,990 --> 00:49:41,637
I am depending on you, Spoons.
You got a little tobacco ih your beard.

521
00:49:41,672 --> 00:49:46,394
Always good to have a medical man on,
doc? - Reptiles gotta stick together!

522
00:49:46,715 --> 00:49:50,397
Right, my brother? - I'm an amphibian.
- Ain't no shame in that...

523
00:49:51,317 --> 00:49:56,320
Woh! Are you sure you're fit for
duty there, soldier? - What?

524
00:49:57,321 --> 00:50:00,002
Well, you gotta a little
something in your eye there...

525
00:50:00,482 --> 00:50:04,603
Oh, that! That there is conjunctivitis,
sir. It's hereditary.

526
00:50:05,604 --> 00:50:08,326
Oh... I'm glad to hear
it ain't contageous.

527
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:12,688
Now, just wait a cotton pickin' minute!
A posse ain't no place for a...

528
00:50:13,688 --> 00:50:14,969
Never mind.

529
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:18,251
Woh! Woh! Hold on there, little sister.
Someone's gonna have to look

530
00:50:18,611 --> 00:50:23,374
after the town while I'm gone.
- Can I get to shoot someone?

531
00:50:24,254 --> 00:50:26,335
Uh... let's put a pin in that.

532
00:50:26,376 --> 00:50:29,778
Sheriff, you're gonna bring that water
back, aren't you?

533
00:50:30,693 --> 00:50:32,693
Count on it, little sister.

534
00:50:32,728 --> 00:50:36,531
Which way do we go, sheriff?
- There's tunnels everywhere!

535
00:50:38,033 --> 00:50:40,554
The whole town is purpurated
with them.

536
00:50:40,589 --> 00:50:43,040
How'd them fellas found
the bank, anyways?

537
00:50:43,075 --> 00:50:47,758
Khm... Gentlemen, if we can stay
on the task here? - Sheriff, over here.

538
00:50:51,361 --> 00:50:53,121
Would you look at that!

539
00:50:53,271 --> 00:50:55,793
Like seeing the face of God!
- Amen, brother.

540
00:50:56,024 --> 00:50:58,826
I remember when it used to flow
every Wednesday.

541
00:50:59,385 --> 00:51:01,010
Those were the halcyon days...

542
00:51:01,045 --> 00:51:01,890
Must be a reason she quit
on us...

543
00:51:01,925 --> 00:51:05,568
Whatever the reason, someone
is controlling this here water!

544
00:51:05,603 --> 00:51:07,648
What do you say, sheriff?

545
00:51:08,489 --> 00:51:11,616
Clearly, the robbers came
from this direction.

546
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:15,348
I say we track this pipe
back to its hydraulic origin,

547
00:51:15,383 --> 00:51:18,677
and apprehend the culprits
behind this aquatic conundrum.

548
00:51:18,712 --> 00:51:19,992
What'd he say? - I thin he said
follow the pipe. - He said follow the pipe.

549
00:51:34,476 --> 00:51:39,599
Whatever you do,
do not look down!

550
00:51:41,448 --> 00:51:44,971
What is this place?
- It's an aquafor.

551
00:51:45,812 --> 00:51:50,293
Ah... What is aquafor?
- Well, it's for aqua.

552
00:51:50,854 --> 00:51:52,971
Well, it's empy now!

553
00:52:11,824 --> 00:52:13,785
Thank you, big one.

554
00:52:16,274 --> 00:52:19,521
It's the end of the line.
- Don't go no further.

555
00:52:19,556 --> 00:52:22,768
Someone or something is
messing with our hydration.

556
00:52:22,803 --> 00:52:24,913
And that pipe has something
to do with it.

557
00:52:24,948 --> 00:52:27,023
Now, I thought we was following
bank robbers!

558
00:52:27,344 --> 00:52:27,508
We're experiencing a paradox shift!

559
00:52:27,543 --> 00:52:31,025
I'm gonna shift the features
on your face if you don't shut up!

560
00:52:33,466 --> 00:52:36,628
Quite you savages! Stop your battlin'.
You're effectin' my cogitation.

561
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:40,475
Wow! I got it!

562
00:52:40,510 --> 00:52:42,191
Snap out them torches!

563
00:52:49,154 --> 00:52:51,436
Smart thinking there,
fellow!

564
00:52:51,876 --> 00:52:54,518
Start climbing! - Get your boot
out of my face!

565
00:52:54,917 --> 00:52:57,238
Not bad, ha, Beans? - If you keep
thinking like that,

566
00:52:57,479 --> 00:52:59,760
your hat's gonna catch on fire.
- Well, you know...

567
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:04,362
You get on the road...
ahhh! Hot, hot, burn, ow...

568
00:53:14,247 --> 00:53:18,049
Poor things... All they wanted
was a little water.

569
00:53:18,329 --> 00:53:21,692
Cactis dying of thirst?
They don't bold way...

570
00:53:22,012 --> 00:53:23,893
Hey look what I've found!
- What'd you got?

571
00:53:24,212 --> 00:53:25,814
I saw it first!
- It got some water!

572
00:53:26,173 --> 00:53:27,895
It's mine!
- Give me that!

573
00:53:28,334 --> 00:53:31,817
Aaa... It's empty anyway.
- I knew that...

574
00:53:32,257 --> 00:53:35,979
Hey, where'd you find that?
- Sheriff, you gonna wanna see this!

575
00:53:39,821 --> 00:53:41,661
It's Mr. Merrymack,
from the bank.

576
00:53:42,102 --> 00:53:44,143
What's he doing here?
- Everybody stand back!

577
00:53:44,623 --> 00:53:47,544
All right, lemme see it. - Looks like
them barriment shot him in the back!

578
00:53:47,985 --> 00:53:50,066
No... this man wasn't shot.

579
00:53:50,386 --> 00:53:52,227
He was drowned.

580
00:53:52,667 --> 00:53:54,668
Drowned?
- In the middle of the desert?

581
00:53:55,108 --> 00:53:57,670
Oh, what a way to go...

582
00:53:58,270 --> 00:54:02,032
Well now... who's boot prints
are those?

583
00:54:05,154 --> 00:54:10,876
That's interesting. Ground still wet...
- I suppose we should bury him...

584
00:54:11,237 --> 00:54:15,718
Oh, no... birds gotta eat too.
- Circle of life!

585
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:21,242
Hey, what's that there dumb
Indian doin'?

586
00:54:23,803 --> 00:54:26,404
I see you're consulting
with the spirits.

587
00:54:26,724 --> 00:54:29,766
No, I'm molting. Means
I'm ready to mate.

588
00:54:30,327 --> 00:54:32,727
Oh. I'll keep that in mind.

589
00:54:33,167 --> 00:54:35,009
Cactus fruit.

590
00:54:35,449 --> 00:54:37,210
Ah, yes. The ancient cactus fruit!

591
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:40,572
I believe you people use it as seasoning
while preparing your native dishes.

592
00:54:40,931 --> 00:54:43,533
Also natural laxative.

593
00:54:44,213 --> 00:54:49,216
Pick up trail. Three men, headed west.
One blind. One with...

594
00:54:50,056 --> 00:54:53,378
...a large prostate, riding side saddle.

595
00:54:53,819 --> 00:54:55,980
What... What'd he say?
- They're ridin' side saddle!

596
00:54:56,339 --> 00:54:58,061
What? - Sshh! We're whisperin'.
- What'd he say?

597
00:54:58,581 --> 00:55:00,221
Someone's got a bad south.

598
00:55:00,289 --> 00:55:02,571
All right. Which one of you
fellas need a check up?

599
00:55:02,930 --> 00:55:04,572
Awkward.

600
00:55:05,325 --> 00:55:08,607
Aaa... what exactly are we
gonna do now?

601
00:55:08,959 --> 00:55:12,161
Now? We ride.

602
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:20,903
That means we're riding now!
This moment.

603
00:56:03,238 --> 00:56:05,879
Marshmallows remind me of
goin' campin' with my daddy.

604
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:08,041
I could eat 'em all night long.

605
00:56:09,681 --> 00:56:13,323
Of course, he did make me cough
'em back up again for breakfast.

606
00:56:15,043 --> 00:56:17,892
This one time,
I coughed up an entire Dalmatian.

607
00:56:17,927 --> 00:56:21,609
That ain't nothin'.
I coughed up a whole tribe of Pygmies.

608
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:24,570
They started lookin' at me weird.

609
00:56:25,130 --> 00:56:27,412
I remember them.
They was quit friendly.

610
00:56:27,972 --> 00:56:31,894
I found a human spinal column
in my fecal matter once.

611
00:56:33,855 --> 00:56:36,777
You might wanna get
that looked at.

612
00:56:37,897 --> 00:56:39,738
Pass the beans,
Beans.

613
00:56:40,379 --> 00:56:42,380
Sheriff?
- No, thanks...

614
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:46,542
Mr. Rango, can you tell us
about the Spirit of the West?

615
00:56:47,142 --> 00:56:50,023
Oh, yes, talk about that?
- Is it true what they say?

616
00:56:51,624 --> 00:56:57,067
Ah... yes... the Spirit of the West.
The eternally unobtainable eye view.

617
00:56:57,427 --> 00:57:01,710
They say he rides in an alabaster carriage
with golden guardians to protect him.

618
00:57:02,790 --> 00:57:06,471
But he only appears to those
who have undertaken an epic quest...

619
00:57:06,912 --> 00:57:10,754
and have made it to the other side.

620
00:57:13,676 --> 00:57:16,077
Uh... Other side of what?

621
00:57:16,437 --> 00:57:20,879
It's a metaphore. - My eye!
- Uh... that's gonna heal right up.

622
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:25,561
Sheriff, what're you going to do
about Rattlesnake Jake?

623
00:57:25,596 --> 00:57:28,115
Hm? What? Where!?

624
00:57:28,434 --> 00:57:32,157
Sorry 'bout that. Word is, you come
against him once or twice.

625
00:57:32,597 --> 00:57:35,959
Ooh! Yeah! Jake!
You mean, my brother.

626
00:57:36,399 --> 00:57:39,041
Your brother?
- That's what I said!

627
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:42,002
But... he's a snake and
you're a lizard.

628
00:57:42,482 --> 00:57:45,244
Well, mamma had an active...
social life.

629
00:57:45,684 --> 00:57:49,046
Did he ever bite you? - Sure enough
did. Look at that baby.

630
00:57:49,486 --> 00:57:54,408
Go ahead. You can touch it. - Oh.
That's interesting. It's a belly button.

631
00:57:54,848 --> 00:57:58,131
Luckily I'm immune to his venom. Put
some in my coffee to get a little tang.

632
00:57:58,530 --> 00:58:00,652
Is it true he's only scared of
them hawks?

633
00:58:01,092 --> 00:58:05,094
Them is what we call -
natural predators.

634
00:58:05,534 --> 00:58:08,736
All this talk about them devils is
splitting my queels on edge!

635
00:58:09,136 --> 00:58:12,217
I ain't sleeping tonight. No, sir!
- Don't you all worry 'bout a thing.

636
00:58:12,617 --> 00:58:17,340
Come tomorrow we'll locate that water
and return to a hero as well!

637
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:22,902
Friends, before we bunk down,
I'd like us all to join hands for a moments.

638
00:58:23,223 --> 00:58:25,824
Say a few words
to the Spirit of the West...

639
00:58:26,265 --> 00:58:28,145
Good idea.

640
00:58:29,546 --> 00:58:32,708
Ain't always spoken rightly to you,
Spirit of the West,

641
00:58:33,589 --> 00:58:39,031
but tonight I wanna thank you for
bringing Sheriff Rango into our lives.

642
00:58:39,391 --> 00:58:44,395
It's a hard life we got. Sometimes
I don't know how we're gonna make it,

643
00:58:44,834 --> 00:58:48,636
but somehow Sheriff Rango
makes me think we will.

644
00:58:48,996 --> 00:58:52,558
We needed a brave man
and you sent us one.

645
00:58:52,919 --> 00:58:55,760
Nice to have someone
to believe in again.

646
00:58:56,200 --> 00:59:00,361
Thank you,
Spirit of the West. Amen.

647
00:59:00,682 --> 00:59:02,924
Amen.

648
00:59:34,788 --> 00:59:37,189
Just checkin'...

649
00:59:38,951 --> 00:59:43,512
It's so cold tonight.
- Thank you.

650
00:59:44,192 --> 00:59:47,464
You ever feel like
those things are lookin' at you?

651
00:59:47,499 --> 00:59:52,123
That's a Spanish Dagger. But around here
we just call 'em the Walkin' Cactus.

652
00:59:52,158 --> 00:59:57,080
Walking? - There's an old legend they
actually walk across the desert to find water.

653
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:00,326
When I was a little girl I'd stay up
late watchin' if they move.

654
01:00:00,361 --> 01:00:04,267
I thought if I could follow them,
they'd lead me to some place wonderful.

655
01:00:04,302 --> 01:00:08,509
Some place with enough water
for everyone...

656
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:13,952
Night after night I watched 'em.
I never saw 'em move.

657
01:00:14,313 --> 01:00:18,755
But you're still watching? - Who didn't
wanna find some place wonderful?

658
01:00:19,114 --> 01:00:23,157
We'll find the water, Beans.
I promise you.

659
01:00:25,319 --> 01:00:28,280
That's such a lonely sound.

660
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:31,881
You ever get lonely?
- Sometimes.

661
01:00:32,282 --> 01:00:37,244
I can't imagine it. You're such a charmer
and everyone likes you so much.

662
01:00:37,565 --> 01:00:41,446
I never made friends easily
like that. - No?

663
01:00:41,807 --> 01:00:44,087
No. We're pretty isolated
out there on the ranch.

664
01:00:44,528 --> 01:00:46,851
Sorta of like being sealed up
in a little box.

665
01:00:46,886 --> 01:00:49,892
Don't really see uh... a lot of folks.

666
01:00:50,332 --> 01:00:52,654
I wouldn't know what that's like.

667
01:00:53,054 --> 01:00:55,936
Is there someone special
in your life, Rango?

668
01:00:56,335 --> 01:00:58,817
Oh! Well, there used to be.
But she couldn't keep her head.

669
01:00:59,177 --> 01:01:01,579
Besides... My life's too dangerous
for that kind of thing.

670
01:01:02,019 --> 01:01:04,820
You know, it's an awful solitary
existence out there on the prairie.

671
01:01:05,260 --> 01:01:07,702
Ridin' the ranges and the such like...

672
01:01:08,221 --> 01:01:10,664
Beans?

673
01:01:34,876 --> 01:01:38,477
Disfunctional family...
Need intervention.

674
01:01:39,038 --> 01:01:41,639
What's that coming?

675
01:01:42,519 --> 01:01:45,680
It's the water!

676
01:01:46,762 --> 01:01:50,683
I have a plan! And each and every
one of you has a part to play.

677
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:54,406
What do I do? - Spoons, you've got
the most important job of all!

678
01:01:54,805 --> 01:01:57,007
You will stay up here on the ridge,
and if anything goes wrong,

679
01:01:57,487 --> 01:02:00,209
you give... the signal.

680
01:02:06,652 --> 01:02:10,574
Muh. Mmmuh!
Mmmmuh! Hmmmuh!

681
01:02:11,093 --> 01:02:13,615
Beans, what size of dress
you're wearing?

682
01:02:14,136 --> 01:02:16,337
I've done it!
- Hallelujah!

683
01:02:16,777 --> 01:02:18,658
I have the water!
- You did it, son.

684
01:02:19,058 --> 01:02:22,020
Well, actually...
- Why can't you be like your brother?

685
01:02:22,540 --> 01:02:24,941
Pappy, about that water, there's
something I gotta tell you...

686
01:02:25,382 --> 01:02:28,703
Hush! Hush up now!
Somebody's comin'!

687
01:02:29,984 --> 01:02:32,825
Gracious! Good afternoon
to thee and thee and thee!

688
01:02:33,466 --> 01:02:38,708
May I present my Madame Repones steps
accordion troops of travelling thespians!

689
01:02:39,228 --> 01:02:41,750
What is that?
- I think they's thespians!.

690
01:02:42,070 --> 01:02:44,632
Thespians!
That's illegal in seven states.

691
01:02:45,271 --> 01:02:48,434
The stage is set, the princess
prepares to take her own life.

692
01:02:48,874 --> 01:02:50,594
I yearn for love.

693
01:02:51,034 --> 01:02:54,076
Meanwhile, the lone centry
stands and watch at the castle gate.

694
01:02:54,637 --> 01:02:56,598
Hark! Who goes there?

695
01:02:57,278 --> 01:03:00,199
This plots highly predictable!
- Quite! This is my favorite part!

696
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:04,361
Arriving to great phanphare
was her aging father.

697
01:03:05,962 --> 01:03:08,163
Strike a spike, Cupid.

698
01:03:09,724 --> 01:03:15,047
Ergh... pretty... unhand... my fair daughter.
And reach for the...

699
01:03:16,127 --> 01:03:19,609
Line? Reach for the sky!

700
01:03:21,370 --> 01:03:24,892
Wha... what was that? - Must
be one of them immersive talers.

701
01:03:25,212 --> 01:03:26,973
We got you surrounded!

702
01:03:27,373 --> 01:03:29,775
You and your entire family get your
hands up where I can see 'em.

703
01:03:30,215 --> 01:03:33,496
Ha, my entire family?

704
01:03:55,308 --> 01:03:58,709
O, it's a full house!

705
01:03:59,030 --> 01:04:03,392
Looks like we gonna have ourselves
a good oldfashioned stand-off.

706
01:04:03,751 --> 01:04:07,433
I'll have you know you are not
looking at our entire continuing.

707
01:04:13,756 --> 01:04:18,240
Wha... What's that? What's that
supposed to be? - That's the signal.

708
01:04:18,599 --> 01:04:22,161
That's the signal. Something
must have gone wrong!

709
01:04:25,883 --> 01:04:29,725
So... uhm, something's
supposed to happen?

710
01:04:30,245 --> 01:04:33,527
I... am... open to suggestions.

711
01:04:40,531 --> 01:04:42,772
Run!

712
01:04:48,374 --> 01:04:50,216
Get on the wagon!

713
01:04:56,298 --> 01:04:59,180
Do we have ourselves some
sport turns?

714
01:05:00,020 --> 01:05:05,944
Ha... I likes it when they run.
- Mabel, give the holler!

715
01:05:11,466 --> 01:05:14,909
Looks like we've made it!
- They're on into to square spots?

716
01:05:15,174 --> 01:05:18,416
Yea! I hope them conmen to
spook right out!

717
01:05:44,671 --> 01:05:46,266
They got bats!

718
01:05:46,301 --> 01:05:48,902
Oh... Here, you drive.

719
01:05:56,369 --> 01:06:00,607
Looks like it's gonna be
soft dinner, come on!

720
01:06:11,218 --> 01:06:13,818
You damnation!
Don't shoot the water!

721
01:06:14,259 --> 01:06:18,821
Jedidiah, it's time for the
Alabaman squeeze-box! - OK, paps.

722
01:06:25,825 --> 01:06:29,547
I'm sensing hostility.
- They're coming!

723
01:06:34,350 --> 01:06:37,271
Helloo!
- Good bye!

724
01:06:46,876 --> 01:06:50,077
Lassoo that swag!

725
01:07:09,808 --> 01:07:14,050
I suggest we take the days of
action! - Just shut up and shoot!

726
01:07:14,489 --> 01:07:16,932
What happened to the sheriff?
- They got him.

727
01:07:17,230 --> 01:07:20,592
Bosefus, give 'em some
jumbo now!

728
01:07:25,547 --> 01:07:28,829
What was that?
Go, check it out.

729
01:07:29,854 --> 01:07:32,735
What is it?
Is there a problem?

730
01:07:33,496 --> 01:07:35,897
Ah... you can count on that.

731
01:08:24,241 --> 01:08:26,082
Headache!

732
01:08:27,536 --> 01:08:30,137
Is that all you got?

733
01:08:47,587 --> 01:08:50,988
That was not yet that unpleasant!

734
01:09:03,283 --> 01:09:05,564
Hey, here! Hold this!

735
01:09:14,770 --> 01:09:17,170
You get your hands of me!

736
01:09:27,215 --> 01:09:28,937
Hold on!

737
01:09:32,418 --> 01:09:34,099
Jump!

738
01:09:56,551 --> 01:09:58,192
That's impossible!

739
01:09:58,592 --> 01:10:01,433
It can't be.
It's empty.

740
01:10:01,793 --> 01:10:03,515
There's no water!

741
01:10:03,994 --> 01:10:06,995
No water? What the hell have we
been fightin' for?

742
01:10:07,436 --> 01:10:11,319
Sir! You have defauled and desacrated
the very sustainance of our livelihood.

743
01:10:11,718 --> 01:10:14,320
I think that part
in that dress is the sheriff.

744
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:16,961
That's the same fella who gave us
the prospecting permit?

745
01:10:17,522 --> 01:10:19,922
A what!?
- Irelevant! Confiscation!

746
01:10:20,363 --> 01:10:22,325
You and your kin are
under arrest for bank robbery

747
01:10:22,644 --> 01:10:24,526
and the murder of our beloved
financial advisor

748
01:10:24,845 --> 01:10:27,767
Johannes Merymack III,
a. k. a... Fluffy Joe.

749
01:10:28,286 --> 01:10:30,689
Sheriff, we ain't killed nobody.
We tunelled into that vault,

750
01:10:31,048 --> 01:10:32,809
but there was nothing
in it.

751
01:10:33,209 --> 01:10:34,971
Someone robbed that bank
before we robbed it.

752
01:10:35,290 --> 01:10:37,051
Where did you get this here jag?

753
01:10:37,371 --> 01:10:39,853
That's what I was tryin' to tell
you pappy. I found it the desert.

754
01:10:40,212 --> 01:10:43,175
Then why darn it did you
bring it here?

755
01:10:43,695 --> 01:10:46,777
Hold on! You're saying this here
jug was empty when you found it?

756
01:10:47,297 --> 01:10:49,578
Aha, that's right!
- Nah, I don't believe a word of him!

757
01:10:50,018 --> 01:10:51,779
Let's hang him, sheriff.
- Spring him up!

758
01:10:52,179 --> 01:10:54,941
Who would take the water into
the desert? - Wouldn't be the first time...

759
01:10:55,501 --> 01:10:58,102
It's a puzzle!
Like a bit of mammagram!

760
01:10:58,542 --> 01:11:01,264
What's goin' on sheriff?
- I don't know.

761
01:11:01,705 --> 01:11:05,305
But I'm gonna strip away this mistery
and expose its private parts!

762
01:11:05,866 --> 01:11:07,947
You and your kin are
comin' with me.

763
01:11:11,673 --> 01:11:13,474
They're coming.

764
01:11:13,795 --> 01:11:14,947
Here they come.

765
01:11:16,276 --> 01:11:18,277
Looks like they caught
the robbers.

766
01:11:41,049 --> 01:11:42,786
Where's the water?

767
01:11:45,264 --> 01:11:47,945
There weren't no water.

768
01:12:01,153 --> 01:12:03,553
Where is he going?

769
01:12:04,113 --> 01:12:07,396
He's going to see the Mayor...

770
01:12:08,596 --> 01:12:12,518
Aaa... he's gotta be pleased with
that, yea! - That's a good one, boss.

771
01:12:22,803 --> 01:12:24,524
Interesting...

772
01:12:24,916 --> 01:12:27,077
I do apologize for the shoes,
Mr. Rango,

773
01:12:27,438 --> 01:12:32,550
but there's certain protocol to this game.
And I'm a bit of strict for protocol.

774
01:12:32,585 --> 01:12:37,662
That's good. 'Cause you gotta few questions
answering, and I got my own protocol.

775
01:12:42,585 --> 01:12:45,244
But why would anyone dump water
in the bloomin' desert?

776
01:12:45,279 --> 01:12:48,968
It does seem a bit naive taking
the word of admitted bank robbers.

777
01:12:49,003 --> 01:12:51,889
Besides, once they hanged,
your job is done.

778
01:12:52,329 --> 01:12:54,291
Bravo! - Job well done!

779
01:12:54,732 --> 01:12:57,397
But what if someone did rob the
bank before they got there?

780
01:12:57,432 --> 01:13:01,154
And who would do that, Mr. Rango?
- I was hoping that you could tell me.

781
01:13:01,675 --> 01:13:04,316
That sounds marshally near to an
accusation.

782
01:13:04,717 --> 01:13:06,477
Take it anyway you like it.

783
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:15,202
Something you said keeps
rattling 'round my frontal lobe.

784
01:13:15,521 --> 01:13:17,403
What's that?

785
01:13:18,043 --> 01:13:21,886
"Control the water,
and you control everything. "

786
01:13:22,405 --> 01:13:26,807
Come on, Mr. Rango!
You tribute divine power to me!

787
01:13:27,248 --> 01:13:30,930
How on Earth could I possibly
control the water?

788
01:13:32,570 --> 01:13:39,254
You obviously mastered this game.
- Well... I've been playing it for many years.

789
01:13:39,574 --> 01:13:42,535
I was here before the highway
split this great valley.

790
01:13:43,057 --> 01:13:48,298
I watched the march of progress.
And I learned a thing or two.

791
01:13:48,819 --> 01:13:52,141
Perhaps it's time you started
to take a long view.

792
01:13:52,420 --> 01:13:56,223
You'd begin to appreciate the
broad sweep of history.

793
01:13:56,583 --> 01:14:03,105
Look out there, son. You can
almost see time passing.

794
01:14:04,667 --> 01:14:10,351
What're you building out here?
Future, Mr. Rango, future.

795
01:14:10,790 --> 01:14:14,072
One day soon, all this is going to
faint into myth.

796
01:14:14,473 --> 01:14:17,113
the frontier town, the lawmen,
the gunslinger...

797
01:14:18,315 --> 01:14:21,596
There's just no place for them
anymore. We're civilized now.

798
01:14:22,116 --> 01:14:23,825
That's right, civilized.

799
01:14:23,860 --> 01:14:25,502
That's what the future holds.

800
01:14:25,942 --> 01:14:28,903
You can either be part of it
or you can be left behind.

801
01:14:29,424 --> 01:14:33,065
Is that what happened to Mr. Merrymack?
Did he get left behind?

802
01:14:33,508 --> 01:14:37,349
Careful, Mr. Rango. You seem to
forget you're just one little lizard.

803
01:14:37,870 --> 01:14:42,311
You seem to forget -
I'm the law 'round these parts.

804
01:14:44,073 --> 01:14:47,235
Our new sheriff's been playing
the hero for so long

805
01:14:47,595 --> 01:14:49,876
he has actually started
to believe it.

806
01:14:50,316 --> 01:14:52,718
Call in Rattlesnake Jake.

807
01:14:53,157 --> 01:14:57,279
Jake's the Grim Reaper. He'll never
leave a rat without ruining his soul!

808
01:14:57,640 --> 01:15:00,002
Do it!

809
01:15:13,648 --> 01:15:17,931
Now be still. You gotta look presentable.
Going to meet your Maker.

810
01:15:18,450 --> 01:15:26,855
La muerte allegado,
death has arrived.

811
01:15:27,976 --> 01:15:36,020
Como estanto suevos?
How will the hero survive?

812
01:15:39,621 --> 01:15:45,105
The Mayor has bought all of the
land in the valley. Except yours, Miss Beans.

813
01:15:45,504 --> 01:15:49,466
That just don't make no sense.
Without water, that land is useless.

814
01:15:49,986 --> 01:15:53,749
Unless he controls the water!
Like a monkey's bladder!

815
01:15:54,229 --> 01:15:56,550
Then he can bring it back once
he bought up all the land.

816
01:15:56,870 --> 01:15:58,871
And then how does he control
the water?

817
01:15:59,392 --> 01:16:01,672
Sheriff, we got a problem.

818
01:16:07,916 --> 01:16:11,838
Hold on, Beans, that
won't be necessary.

819
01:16:18,801 --> 01:16:18,833
Hang them!
- Tear them apart!

820
01:16:18,868 --> 01:16:20,274
Calm down.
Calm down!

821
01:16:21,395 --> 01:16:23,420
Let them pay the price!

822
01:16:23,455 --> 01:16:25,055
We can smack down
their gimmicks!

823
01:16:25,415 --> 01:16:27,456
You too, Spoons?

824
01:16:27,816 --> 01:16:30,538
They're done taking that water.
They'd taken everything we got.

825
01:16:30,978 --> 01:16:32,939
No one to hang anyone up.
Not while I'm the sheriff.

826
01:16:33,258 --> 01:16:34,820
But it's all his fault!

827
01:16:35,139 --> 01:16:37,181
You said you was going
to bring the water...

828
01:16:37,661 --> 01:16:41,903
It's just we got no hope without that
water. - We got nothing left to believe.

829
01:16:42,303 --> 01:16:44,264
You see that sign up there?

830
01:16:44,625 --> 01:16:47,346
As long as that sign says "sheriff",
you can believe

831
01:16:47,666 --> 01:16:49,748
there's law and order in this town!

832
01:16:50,307 --> 01:16:52,670
But without law and order!
Luminate on that!

833
01:16:53,149 --> 01:16:56,191
Oh, yea! Starts out slow...
like a... fungus.

834
01:16:56,511 --> 01:16:59,232
Somebody says a cross word,
accusations start climbin'...

835
01:16:59,592 --> 01:17:02,114
neighbour turn on neighbour,
pretty soon we're eating our children

836
01:17:02,514 --> 01:17:04,355
and dogs and cats will get togehter
to create all sorts

837
01:17:04,716 --> 01:17:07,196
of unatural murant apparitions!

838
01:17:07,636 --> 01:17:10,799
So you want something to
believe in, Spoons?

839
01:17:12,571 --> 01:17:14,813
Believe in me.

840
01:17:15,613 --> 01:17:18,415
Believe in that sign.

841
01:17:18,855 --> 01:17:22,576
As long as it hangs there,
we got hope.

842
01:17:47,669 --> 01:17:50,631
Hello, "brother".

843
01:17:51,072 --> 01:17:53,353
Thirsty?

844
01:18:03,198 --> 01:18:05,999
Long time, brother.

845
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:11,922
How've you been keeping?
- Oh, well, you know...

846
01:18:12,443 --> 01:18:16,525
I heard all that turnabout how you
killed them Jenkins brothers.

847
01:18:17,044 --> 01:18:19,327
with one bullet,
wasn't it?

848
01:18:19,686 --> 01:18:21,967
Isn't that right?

849
01:18:22,488 --> 01:18:26,210
All these good folks here believed
your little stories, don't they?

850
01:18:26,530 --> 01:18:30,875
Why, they believe you're
just a stone killer, don't they?

851
01:18:30,910 --> 01:18:33,597
Seems these folks trust you.

852
01:18:33,916 --> 01:18:36,437
They think you're gonna
save their little town.

853
01:18:36,798 --> 01:18:42,412
They think you're gonna
save their little souls.

854
01:18:43,636 --> 01:18:53,461
But we know better.
Don't we?

855
01:18:53,496 --> 01:18:57,259
So why don't you show your friends
here what you're made of?

856
01:18:57,578 --> 01:19:00,299
Show 'em who you really are.

857
01:19:00,701 --> 01:19:03,461
Why don't you just pull your
gun and shoot me?

858
01:19:03,782 --> 01:19:06,143
But of course, you won't need
all the bean...

859
01:19:06,503 --> 01:19:10,081
Just one, right?

860
01:19:10,116 --> 01:19:15,180
Go ahead, hero.
Pull the trigger.

861
01:19:16,107 --> 01:19:19,468
You got killer in
your eyes, son?

862
01:19:20,588 --> 01:19:22,951
I don't see it.

863
01:19:25,032 --> 01:19:30,754
You didn't do any of them things
you said? You didn't kill Jenkins brothers?

864
01:19:31,154 --> 01:19:34,316
You ain't even from the West,
are you?

865
01:19:34,676 --> 01:19:36,717
Say it!

866
01:19:37,157 --> 01:19:41,640
No. - O, speak up. I don't think
your friends here heard you.

867
01:19:43,801 --> 01:19:49,844
No. - All you done is lied to these good people.
You ain't nothing but a freak and a coward.

868
01:19:50,165 --> 01:19:52,783
Isn't that right?

869
01:19:52,818 --> 01:19:58,946
Yes. - Louder!
- Yes.

870
01:19:58,981 --> 01:19:59,066
Listen closely, you pathetic
fraud. This is my town.

871
01:20:05,825 --> 01:20:16,975
If I ever see you again, I'll take
your soul straight down to hell!

872
01:20:26,048 --> 01:20:32,103
Who are you?

873
01:22:25,096 --> 01:22:27,617
Who am I?

874
01:22:28,639 --> 01:22:31,039
I am nobody.

875
01:24:24,262 --> 01:24:27,864
Golden guardians!

876
01:24:28,095 --> 01:24:31,122
The alabaster carriage!

877
01:24:35,445 --> 01:24:38,107
The Spirit of the West!

878
01:24:42,111 --> 01:24:43,471
Excuse me... Mister...
Spirit? Sir?

879
01:24:47,473 --> 01:24:50,835
Aaa... here's the beauty. Sometimes
you gotta dig deep

880
01:24:51,155 --> 01:24:54,437
to find what you're
looking for.

881
01:24:54,677 --> 01:24:56,959
So you made it...

882
01:24:57,518 --> 01:24:59,679
Is this Heaven?

883
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:03,234
If it were, we'd be eating
Pop-Tarts with Kim Novak.

884
01:25:03,269 --> 01:25:05,576
Yea... ha... no kidding?

885
01:25:06,815 --> 01:25:10,138
What are you doing out here?
- Searching... same as you.

886
01:25:12,123 --> 01:25:15,085
I don't even know what I'm
looking for.

887
01:25:15,365 --> 01:25:16,611
I don't even know
who I am.

888
01:25:16,646 --> 01:25:19,367
And they used to call you
"The Man with Name".

889
01:25:19,807 --> 01:25:23,209
These days, they gotta a name
for just about everything.

890
01:25:23,609 --> 01:25:27,652
It doesn't matter what they call
you, it's the deeds, that make the man.

891
01:25:28,172 --> 01:25:31,573
But my deeds just made things worse.
I'm a fraud. I'm a phoney!

892
01:25:31,893 --> 01:25:35,815
My friends believed in me, but
they need some kinda hero...

893
01:25:36,176 --> 01:25:39,858
Then be a hero.
- No, no, no, you don't understand.

894
01:25:40,098 --> 01:25:42,898
I'm not even supposed
to be here. - That's right.

895
01:25:43,260 --> 01:25:47,061
You came a long way to find
something that isn't out here.

896
01:25:47,382 --> 01:25:50,543
Don't you see?
It's not about you.

897
01:25:50,903 --> 01:25:54,266
It's about them.

898
01:25:55,466 --> 01:26:00,948
But I can't go back... - You don't
know that you gotta choice, son.

899
01:26:03,029 --> 01:26:07,792
No man can walk out on his
own story.

900
01:26:18,197 --> 01:26:21,238
So, you made it.

901
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:25,962
That's right, amigo.
The other side of the road.

902
01:26:27,682 --> 01:26:30,923
Did you just see that?

903
01:26:31,284 --> 01:26:37,728
We all see what we need to see.
Beautiful, isn't it?

904
01:26:48,614 --> 01:26:52,334
Yes... It is.

905
01:26:52,775 --> 01:26:57,057
Come, my friend.
I want to show you something.

906
01:26:59,859 --> 01:27:04,902
Many years ago, this entire valley
was covered in aqua.

907
01:27:06,102 --> 01:27:09,024
Now... only one question
remains:

908
01:27:10,104 --> 01:27:12,225
Where did it go?

909
01:27:47,163 --> 01:27:49,405
They follow the water.

910
01:27:49,764 --> 01:27:53,005
They follow the water!
Come on!

911
01:28:28,064 --> 01:28:32,826
It just don't make no sense.
Without water, that land is useless.

912
01:28:33,187 --> 01:28:35,387
What are you building
out there?

913
01:28:35,908 --> 01:28:37,909
The future, Mr. Rango.

914
01:28:38,309 --> 01:28:42,912
You can either be part of it,
or you can be left behind.

915
01:28:44,072 --> 01:28:48,234
I was here before the highway
split this great valley.

916
01:28:49,796 --> 01:28:55,198
I watched the march of progress.
And I learned a thing or two.

917
01:29:00,240 --> 01:29:05,363
Control the water,
and you'll control everything.

918
01:29:12,687 --> 01:29:16,969
Come, now, Mr. Rango!
You tribute divine power to me!

919
01:29:17,249 --> 01:29:21,611
How on Earth could I
possibly control the water?

920
01:29:47,185 --> 01:29:50,267
<b>EMMERGENCY SHUT OFF
valve 6</b>

921
01:29:55,623 --> 01:29:58,665
What now, amigo?

922
01:30:05,308 --> 01:30:08,830
No man can walk out
of his own story.

923
01:30:09,830 --> 01:30:11,471
I'm going back.

924
01:30:12,124 --> 01:30:12,835
But why?

925
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:18,003
Because that's who I am.

926
01:30:29,247 --> 01:30:34,712
You gotta lot of nerve showing up
here, lawman! What do you want?

927
01:30:34,747 --> 01:30:37,112
Your pappy and them boys are
'bout to hang for something

928
01:30:37,553 --> 01:30:41,155
they didn't do. But I have a plan.

929
01:31:09,729 --> 01:31:12,892
I appreciate how difficult this is
for you, Beans.

930
01:31:13,251 --> 01:31:15,749
But you're making a practical
decision.

931
01:31:15,784 --> 01:31:17,911
Decisions... Decisions...

932
01:31:18,391 --> 01:31:21,632
There is no need
for any more suffering...

933
01:31:28,233 --> 01:31:32,076
Your family's ranch is nothing
but a wasteland now.

934
01:31:32,555 --> 01:31:38,558
Sign the deed and relieve yourself
of your father's burden.

935
01:31:39,003 --> 01:31:41,804
My daddy was not a burden!

936
01:31:42,245 --> 01:31:45,846
Keep your blood money,
and I'll keep my land!

937
01:31:50,129 --> 01:31:53,371
Do what he says or by all
the fires of the black pit

938
01:31:53,731 --> 01:31:58,053
I'll squeeze them pretty brown
eyes right out of your skull!

939
01:31:58,413 --> 01:32:01,895
Now, hold on, Jake, there's no need...
- Let me do my job!

940
01:32:02,215 --> 01:32:06,017
You brought me here now we're
gonna play this sling out to the end.

941
01:32:06,578 --> 01:32:10,540
Sign the damn paper, woman!
- Go to hell!

942
01:32:10,980 --> 01:32:13,821
Where do you think
I come from?

943
01:32:14,340 --> 01:32:16,703
Look into my eyes...

944
01:32:17,063 --> 01:32:20,104
I wanna see you die!

945
01:32:23,265 --> 01:32:26,668
Jake!

946
01:32:28,509 --> 01:32:30,950
I'm calling you out!

947
01:32:32,364 --> 01:32:34,125
Jake!

948
01:32:34,685 --> 01:32:39,128
This day just got a
little more interesting.

949
01:33:05,902 --> 01:33:08,063
Put her down.

950
01:33:08,383 --> 01:33:10,935
Or what, little man?
You gonna kill me?

951
01:33:10,970 --> 01:33:14,576
That's just about the
size of it.

952
01:33:15,097 --> 01:33:18,059
Get those filthy paws of me!
- Shut up your gob!

953
01:33:18,499 --> 01:33:21,860
All right, sheriff.
Make your move.

954
01:34:53,427 --> 01:34:56,069
Now, amigos!

955
01:34:59,511 --> 01:35:02,913
Pull! Pull!

956
01:35:19,521 --> 01:35:22,362
That was a bad idea.

957
01:35:26,044 --> 01:35:28,765
Thirsty, "Brother"?

958
01:35:32,288 --> 01:35:35,129
It's coming!

959
01:35:40,891 --> 01:35:43,733
This is a miracle!
- Hold on!

960
01:35:50,617 --> 01:35:53,259
Look, the water!
- What is that?

961
01:35:54,098 --> 01:35:55,859
It's our salvation, pappy!

962
01:35:56,420 --> 01:35:59,981
It's our jailway going out!
We're gonna escape!

963
01:36:09,707 --> 01:36:12,499
I'm gonna blow so many holes
in your body, you're be leaking led!

964
01:36:12,534 --> 01:36:15,580
Then it's a good thing
I brought some back-up.

965
01:36:16,340 --> 01:36:18,140
What?

966
01:36:30,948 --> 01:36:35,630
Ain't no hawk!
Ain't nothing but bats!

967
01:36:37,831 --> 01:36:41,193
Stick to the plan boys!
Aim for his head!

968
01:36:53,319 --> 01:36:57,441
It only takes one bullet.
- You ain't got the nerve!

969
01:36:58,442 --> 01:37:00,602
Try me.

970
01:37:04,765 --> 01:37:09,128
Oh, Mr. Rango... aren't you
forgetting something?

971
01:37:13,930 --> 01:37:17,851
Hand me your gun, sheriff.

972
01:37:18,732 --> 01:37:21,934
Now, Mr. Rango!

973
01:37:32,819 --> 01:37:35,540
Beans, hold on!
Don't worry! I've got a plan!

974
01:37:36,302 --> 01:37:40,424
Help!
Open the door!

975
01:37:41,224 --> 01:37:43,104
OK, plan B.

976
01:37:43,825 --> 01:37:45,946
What? Beans,
you're mumbling!

977
01:37:46,666 --> 01:37:50,188
All my problems are taken
care of. Except for one.

978
01:37:50,709 --> 01:37:54,230
It's a new West, Jake, there is
no room for gunslingers any more

979
01:37:54,671 --> 01:37:58,353
We're businessmen now.
- We got new hats.

980
01:37:58,793 --> 01:38:02,395
Where I come from, we call
this im-provi-sation.

981
01:38:03,035 --> 01:38:05,557
You're came back!

982
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:14,961
What was that!?

983
01:38:15,281 --> 01:38:19,844
No need to panic! But I think you just
swallowed our plan B. - What?

984
01:38:20,404 --> 01:38:22,244
OK... panic time.

985
01:38:22,685 --> 01:38:26,527
You and the sheriff are more alike
than you think. Nothing but legends.

986
01:38:26,967 --> 01:38:31,770
Pretty soon no one will believe
you've even existed.

987
01:38:33,731 --> 01:38:36,772
One last bullet to kill the
last outlaw.

988
01:38:38,173 --> 01:38:41,135
How fitting!

989
01:39:15,192 --> 01:39:19,115
Sheriff, I'm sure if we work together,
we can reach mutually beneficial

990
01:39:19,474 --> 01:39:25,117
solution to our current situation.
- You better take it up with him.

991
01:39:35,042 --> 01:39:37,764
One bullet...

992
01:39:38,205 --> 01:39:40,845
I tip my hat to you.

993
01:39:41,286 --> 01:39:45,408
As one legend to another.

994
01:39:45,728 --> 01:39:48,128
What was that you say?

995
01:39:48,490 --> 01:39:54,011
Pretty soon no one will believe
you've even existed?

996
01:40:06,925 --> 01:40:13,248
Rango! You brought the
water back. Just like you promised.

997
01:40:13,609 --> 01:40:15,912
You really are a hero...

998
01:40:15,947 --> 01:40:21,310
Well, thing about heros is you never...
- Don't spoil...

999
01:40:21,950 --> 01:40:25,352
Well I don't know about you,
but I could sure go for a dip!

1000
01:40:28,714 --> 01:40:32,355
And so the lizard completes
his journey.

1001
01:40:32,876 --> 01:40:36,078
From the humble beginnings to the
legend we sing of today.

1002
01:40:36,557 --> 01:40:40,720
And although, he's certain to die.
Perhaps from... er... household accident!

1003
01:40:41,080 --> 01:40:43,802
Which account for 65 % all
unatural deaths.

1004
01:40:44,121 --> 01:40:47,724
The people of the village will
always remember

1005
01:40:48,044 --> 01:40:50,965
the name of the ONE
who saved them.

1006
01:40:51,245 --> 01:40:53,568
Rango!
