Effective at 1200 hours,

171
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:34,540

[In-hwan] General Han,
you formed this unit yourself.

176
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:21,378
You said…

177
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:23,964
you'd make sure to never turn a blind eye.

178
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,967
That's the reason
I responded to your message.

179
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:29,136
Right.

180
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,597
I did say that.

181
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:35,559
Why are you doing this, sir?

182
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,484
Because the Crow Platoon
is no longer needed.

183
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,986
No amount of cleaning up

184
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,322
will ever fix this now.

185
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,199
This job…

186
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,285
What about our mission?

187
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,120
Are you saying we should give up?

188
00:15:57,873 --> 00:16:00,125
It's not giving up, it's a choice.

189

Get out of here.

This nation never thanked you.

193
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,806
Just take your best soldiers and go.

194

to head to camp and do what, pray?

198
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,775
No. Anywhere, but there.
