Billions of years ago...

00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:38,038
...a race of immortals harnessed
the most powerful force in existence:

The emerald energy of willpower.

4

These immortals,
the Guardians of the Universe...

watch over all of existence:

The planet Oa.

7
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:55,355
They divided the universe
into 3600 sectors.

8
00:00:55,488 --> 00:01:01,094
A ring powered by the energy of will
was sent to every sector to select a recruit.

In order to be chosen by the ring,
it was said one must be without fear.

Together, these 3600 recruits...

...formed the intergalactic peacekeepers
known as the Green Lantern Corps.

Of all the threats the Corps ever faced...

known as Parallax.
