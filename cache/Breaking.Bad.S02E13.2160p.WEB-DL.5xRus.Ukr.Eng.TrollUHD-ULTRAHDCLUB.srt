1
00:02:52,269 --> 00:02:54,354
Come on.

2
00:02:55,897 --> 00:02:57,608
Come on.

3
00:02:58,108 --> 00:02:59,860
Come...

4
00:03:00,068 --> 00:03:02,904
Come on. Come on, baby.

5
00:03:03,572 --> 00:03:08,577
Please, please. Come on, come on.
Come on!

6
00:03:35,437 --> 00:03:39,107
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

7
00:04:08,512 --> 00:04:09,930
Yeah.

8
00:04:12,057 --> 00:04:16,144
Slow down. Slow... Slow down.

9
00:04:16,353 --> 00:04:19,398
And just... Just take a deep breath.

10
00:04:19,815 --> 00:04:21,233
Do it.

11
00:04:22,025 --> 00:04:23,485
All right.

12
00:04:24,486 --> 00:04:26,238
Now, what happened?

13
00:04:39,042 --> 00:04:43,771
All right. All right. Now listen...

14
00:04:43,855 --> 00:04:48,176
Listen to me. Are you listening?

15
00:04:49,011 --> 00:04:51,888
Everything is gonna be okay.
I promise.

16
00:04:52,097 --> 00:04:54,141
No, no... Listen. Calm down.

17
00:04:54,349 --> 00:04:55,851
Just...

18
00:04:56,727 --> 00:05:00,272
Sit tight. I know who to call.

19
00:05:27,633 --> 00:05:28,800
Saul Goodman sent me.

20
00:05:38,477 --> 00:05:41,188
Come on. Inside.

21
00:05:48,612 --> 00:05:50,405
Watch the door.

22
00:05:53,492 --> 00:05:55,243
Where is she?

23
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:27,169
Any other drugs in the house?

24
00:07:32,716 --> 00:07:36,136
Think hard.
Your freedom depends on it.

25
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,480
What about guns?
You got any guns in the house?

26
00:07:42,768 --> 00:07:44,269
Here's your story.

27
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:48,023
You woke up. You found her.
That's all you know.

28
00:07:48,565 --> 00:07:50,108
Say it.

29
00:07:51,401 --> 00:07:55,697
Say it, please. "I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know."

30
00:07:59,076 --> 00:08:01,703
Say it. "I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know."

31
00:08:01,912 --> 00:08:03,962
I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know.

32
00:08:04,331 --> 00:08:05,332
Again.

33
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:08,258
I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know.

34
00:08:08,377 --> 00:08:09,962
Again. Again.

35
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:13,131
I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know.

36
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:16,718
I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know.

37
00:08:22,224 --> 00:08:24,142
Once you call, the people who show up

38
00:08:24,226 --> 00:08:26,826
will be with
the Office of Medical Investigations.

39
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,398
That's primarily who you'll talk to.

40
00:08:29,606 --> 00:08:31,900
Police officers may arrive, they may not.

41
00:08:32,109 --> 00:08:34,309
Depends on how busy
a morning they're having.

42
00:08:34,403 --> 00:08:36,905
Typically, ODs are not
a high-priority call.

43
00:08:37,656 --> 00:08:39,490
There's nothing to incriminate you,

44
00:08:39,574 --> 00:08:42,074
so I'd be amazed
if you got placed under arrest.

45
00:08:42,786 --> 00:08:47,541
However, if you do, you say nothing.

46
00:08:47,749 --> 00:08:49,876
You tell them you just want your lawyer.

47
00:08:50,085 --> 00:08:52,296
Then you call Saul Goodman.

48
00:08:53,213 --> 00:08:55,924
And do I need to state the obvious?

49
00:08:57,634 --> 00:09:00,053
I was not here.

50
00:09:10,314 --> 00:09:12,014
You put on a long-sleeved shirt,

51
00:09:12,107 --> 00:09:14,207
and cover those track marks on your arm.

52
00:09:18,071 --> 00:09:21,366
Count down from 20, and then you dial.

53
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:37,174
Hang tough.
You're in the home stretch.

54
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,911
Do you want 2-percent or skim?

55
00:10:06,119 --> 00:10:09,998
- Two.
- Two. All right.

56
00:10:12,834 --> 00:10:14,378
Thank you.

57
00:10:18,215 --> 00:10:19,841
Junior.

58
00:10:25,222 --> 00:10:27,057
Junior.

59
00:10:27,641 --> 00:10:30,060
- Flynn.
- What?

60
00:10:31,228 --> 00:10:32,688
Flynn.

61
00:10:35,023 --> 00:10:36,650
Flynn.

62
00:10:36,984 --> 00:10:39,361
I'll be there in a minute.

63
00:10:44,408 --> 00:10:46,201
You all right?

64
00:10:51,248 --> 00:10:54,584
Flynn, get your butt in here.

65
00:10:55,335 --> 00:10:58,630
Oh, my God. Mom, Dad, come here.
You gotta see this.

66
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:00,841
Seriously.

67
00:11:03,677 --> 00:11:08,223
- What?
- Look right there. Look at that.

68
00:11:10,851 --> 00:11:11,852
Are those donations?

69
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,960
- Yes.
- Actual donations for your dad?

70
00:11:16,773 --> 00:11:21,528
Total strangers gave us $490.

71
00:11:21,737 --> 00:11:26,575
Twenty-six people.
Virginia, Minnesota, Montana.

72
00:11:26,783 --> 00:11:30,245
Look at this one. Vancouver.
All the way up in Canada.

73
00:11:30,787 --> 00:11:33,832
And it's all real, actual money.

74
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:38,170
It's actually right there
in the PayPal account.

75
00:11:39,463 --> 00:11:42,257
And look what they're saying.

76
00:11:42,466 --> 00:11:46,762
"Hang in there, Walt." "Good luck."
"Hang in there."

77
00:11:47,763 --> 00:11:49,890
Isn't this awesome?

78
00:11:51,975 --> 00:11:56,396
That's... Wow, that is something.

79
00:11:58,315 --> 00:12:01,068
Walt, don't you think
a little thank-you is in order?

80
00:12:02,027 --> 00:12:05,364
Yes, absolutely. Thank you, son.

81
00:12:05,572 --> 00:12:08,784
Thank you. This is a big, big help.

82
00:12:10,118 --> 00:12:15,332
Oh, look, 20 more bucks
from Thunder Bay, Ontario.

83
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:20,545
Damn. Five hundred and ten dollars.

84
00:12:29,012 --> 00:12:32,307
<i>If you're trying to sell me something,
I've got four words for you.:</i>

85
00:12:32,391 --> 00:12:33,392
<i>"Do-not-call list."</i>

86
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,395
<i>However, if you're cool,
leave it at the beep.</i>

87
00:12:36,603 --> 00:12:39,231
How did I know you wouldn't be
answering your phone?

88
00:12:39,439 --> 00:12:41,608
I'm on my way.
I'm gonna be there momentarily.

89
00:12:41,692 --> 00:12:47,281
I expect you on the porch, bag packed,
ready to go. No excuses.

90
00:13:30,991 --> 00:13:34,620
Sir, you may not wanna be here for this.

91
00:13:52,429 --> 00:13:58,518
I just woke up and I found her.

92
00:13:58,727 --> 00:14:00,562
That's all I know.

93
00:14:01,104 --> 00:14:03,065
What's her date of birth?

94
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:12,908
Sir, your daughter's date of birth?

95
00:14:13,867 --> 00:14:15,327
April...

96
00:14:15,535 --> 00:14:19,414
- April 4th, 1982.
- Okay.

97
00:14:19,873 --> 00:14:24,294
And mother's maiden name
and place of birth.

98
00:14:25,087 --> 00:14:27,839
- My mother?
- Your daughter's mother.

99
00:14:29,258 --> 00:14:30,676
Bishop.

100
00:14:32,427 --> 00:14:35,681
- And place of birth?
- Phoenix.

101
00:14:37,307 --> 00:14:38,642
Phoenix, Arizona?

102
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,564
This is our address.

103
00:14:45,315 --> 00:14:47,150
Do you have someone who can drive you?

104
00:14:47,234 --> 00:14:48,652
I can drive.

105
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,945
Well, then if you'd like to meet us there

106
00:14:51,029 --> 00:14:53,573
we can complete the intake
and take our samples,

107
00:14:53,657 --> 00:14:55,951
and then you can make your arrangements.

108
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:57,494
Okay?

109
00:14:57,703 --> 00:15:01,248
Now, do you need a card?
Will you both be coming?

110
00:15:25,355 --> 00:15:28,817
I don't believe it.
Walt, you have to see this.

111
00:15:29,026 --> 00:15:31,028
- Forty from Te...
- Terre Haute.

112
00:15:31,236 --> 00:15:32,237
Walt.

113
00:15:42,748 --> 00:15:43,749
<i>It's me.</i>

114
00:15:43,957 --> 00:15:46,084
<i>Are you there? Hello.</i>

115
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:50,547
I'm just checking in.

116
00:15:51,131 --> 00:15:55,093
Our friend says
he thinks everything went well.

117
00:15:55,302 --> 00:15:57,638
That's... That's good.

118
00:15:57,846 --> 00:16:02,017
So listen. Just call me, all right?

119
00:16:02,225 --> 00:16:07,189
Hey, Walt, you've gotta come in here.
We just broke a thousand dollars.

120
00:16:10,317 --> 00:16:13,111
All right. I'm coming.

121
00:16:14,529 --> 00:16:17,532
Some of you already know
my brother-in-law. He's a good man.

122
00:16:17,741 --> 00:16:20,827
The doctors say this operation
has a real chance of helping him.

123
00:16:20,911 --> 00:16:25,165
They're also saying they wanna
be paid in private islands, so dig deep.

124
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:27,459
Biggest donation

125
00:16:27,668 --> 00:16:30,504
gets a six-pack
of my very own Schraderbrau.

126
00:16:31,338 --> 00:16:33,215
Home-brewed to silky perfection.

127
00:16:33,423 --> 00:16:35,273
Smallest donation gets two six-packs.

128
00:16:35,467 --> 00:16:38,595
All right. Other than Gomie here
pees sitting down

129
00:16:38,804 --> 00:16:39,954
here's what we know.

130
00:16:40,055 --> 00:16:42,432
Christian Ortega, a.k.a. Combo.

131
00:16:42,641 --> 00:16:45,227
Shot dead
by an unknown assailant last month.

132
00:16:45,435 --> 00:16:47,062
"Combo?" I hear you say.

133
00:16:47,604 --> 00:16:51,233
"Why, I'm unfamiliar with that name.
Was he a Nobel laureate perchance?"

134
00:16:51,441 --> 00:16:54,069
No. He was a dipshit
wannabe banger.

135
00:16:54,278 --> 00:16:56,822
Now, no arrests,
save for stealing a baby Jesus

136
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:59,741
from a Knights of Columbus manger
back when he was 17.

137
00:16:59,825 --> 00:17:03,787
This dude was so low-rep,
he never showed up on our radar.

138
00:17:04,121 --> 00:17:05,831
So why am I talking about him?

139
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:09,459
Anyone? Anyone?

140
00:17:09,668 --> 00:17:10,669
Bueller?

141
00:17:11,128 --> 00:17:13,178
- He was dealing Blue Sky.
- That's right.

142
00:17:13,297 --> 00:17:16,147
Now, how is it that the purest,
most professional grade

143
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:20,929
of meth we've ever come across
is being slung by the likes of that?

144
00:17:21,138 --> 00:17:22,598
But wait. It gets better.

145
00:17:22,806 --> 00:17:25,934
Since baby-Jesus thief there
slowed a bullet with his neck

146
00:17:26,143 --> 00:17:28,311
the blue stuff's
vanished from town, okay?

147
00:17:28,395 --> 00:17:31,315
Not a speck to be found
in Albuquerque. Now, why is that?

148
00:17:32,399 --> 00:17:36,903
Well, because maybe
your Heisenberg's in prison.

149
00:17:37,821 --> 00:17:40,198
So says A.P.D.
They think they got their man.

150
00:17:40,407 --> 00:17:42,826
I know you don't buy it,
but maybe it's true.

151
00:17:43,035 --> 00:17:48,749
James Edward Kilkelly, yeah.
A.P.D. thinks this is our mastermind.

152
00:17:48,957 --> 00:17:51,084
You believe that,
I got a bridge to sell you.

153
00:17:51,168 --> 00:17:53,920
- He copped to it, didn't he?
- For an extra pudding cup

154
00:17:54,004 --> 00:17:55,404
every night at Los Lunas?

155
00:17:55,547 --> 00:17:57,747
Maybe if you give him
a pack of cigarettes

156
00:17:57,841 --> 00:18:01,094
he'll tell you what
he did with Jimmy Hoffa. No, no, no.

157
00:18:01,303 --> 00:18:02,596
I've been thinking.

158
00:18:02,804 --> 00:18:07,309
Top-shelf product like this?
It doesn't fall off the face of the earth.

159
00:18:07,517 --> 00:18:09,467
Raw talent's bound to pop up somewhere.

160
00:18:09,645 --> 00:18:12,395
It's like Whack-A-Mole.
So I've been making phone calls.

161
00:18:12,522 --> 00:18:15,901
Local police departments,
small-town sheriffs.

162
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:19,404
Haven't had much luck
inside the Land of Enchantment.

163
00:18:19,488 --> 00:18:22,032
But outside,
I've got reports of the blue stuff

164
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,290
making a scene here in Texas,
Arizona, Colorado and Nevada.

165
00:18:25,452 --> 00:18:29,581
In fact, everywhere but here.

166
00:18:30,123 --> 00:18:34,711
Almost as if somebody wised up,
stopped shitting where they eat.

167
00:18:35,879 --> 00:18:37,256
Now

168
00:18:38,048 --> 00:18:40,676
I say Heisenberg's still out there.

169
00:18:41,426 --> 00:18:43,845
I say he's gone regional.

170
00:18:44,054 --> 00:18:46,265
Only he's still right here in town.

171
00:18:47,391 --> 00:18:50,185
Come on, 2800.

172
00:18:50,394 --> 00:18:53,689
Come on, big 28. You can do it.

173
00:18:53,897 --> 00:18:56,525
Only 30 more dollars. Thirty more.

174
00:18:57,484 --> 00:19:00,362
Fo... Forty dollars! Twenty-eight ten.

175
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:02,030
- Yes!
- Yes!

176
00:19:05,826 --> 00:19:06,827
Who's gonna be next?

177
00:19:07,035 --> 00:19:08,829
Your guy found him?

178
00:19:09,329 --> 00:19:11,081
Where is he?

179
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:12,291
Okay, listen.

180
00:19:12,499 --> 00:19:14,001
No, no, I don't care.

181
00:19:14,209 --> 00:19:15,836
You have your guy pick...

182
00:19:16,044 --> 00:19:18,046
Saul. Just shut... Saul.

183
00:19:18,255 --> 00:19:21,550
Saul, shut up and give me the address.

184
00:19:24,761 --> 00:19:26,346
I don't recommend it.

185
00:19:27,723 --> 00:19:29,807
A.P.D.'s been known
to sit on this place

186
00:19:29,891 --> 00:19:32,561
keep an eye on the comings and goings.

187
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:34,646
Are they here now?

188
00:19:34,855 --> 00:19:38,734
Well, I don't see any sign,
but that's the point.

189
00:19:39,901 --> 00:19:42,029
Police could be the least of it.

190
00:19:42,237 --> 00:19:44,197
You could just get mugged or shot.

191
00:19:46,575 --> 00:19:49,578
How about you go on home, Walter?

192
00:19:49,786 --> 00:19:51,788
Let me handle this.

193
00:20:21,526 --> 00:20:23,028
Yo.

194
00:21:22,254 --> 00:21:23,964
Jesse.

195
00:21:27,634 --> 00:21:30,053
Jesse. Jesse. Look at me, son.

196
00:21:30,262 --> 00:21:33,181
- Wake up. Wake up.
- Hey.

197
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:37,060
I ain't got nothing for you, man.
It's all gone.

198
00:21:37,269 --> 00:21:39,271
Jesse, damn it, wake up. Just...

199
00:21:39,479 --> 00:21:42,733
Jesse, Jesse. Jesse, it's me.
Okay, it's me. It's Walt. It's Walt.

200
00:21:42,941 --> 00:21:44,067
Jesse.

201
00:21:44,276 --> 00:21:46,945
- Yeah.
- Come on, let's get out of here.

202
00:21:47,154 --> 00:21:50,782
No, no, no.

203
00:21:50,991 --> 00:21:52,993
- I'm good.
- Come on. Help me out now.

204
00:21:53,201 --> 00:21:56,538
I'm good. I'm good.
Right here, man. Right here.

205
00:21:56,747 --> 00:21:59,916
Listen, Jesse, you are not good
right here.

206
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:02,294
You are not good at all. You hear?

207
00:22:02,836 --> 00:22:06,173
Now, you just put your arms
around me. Come on.

208
00:22:06,381 --> 00:22:07,758
You're gonna stand up,

209
00:22:07,966 --> 00:22:10,427
and we're gonna walk out of here, okay?

210
00:22:10,636 --> 00:22:12,804
We're gonna take you
someplace nice and safe.

211
00:22:12,888 --> 00:22:16,141
That's it. Now, let's go.
Come on. Here we go.

212
00:22:44,086 --> 00:22:46,088
I killed her.

213
00:22:46,296 --> 00:22:49,341
- What?
- I killed her. It was me.

214
00:22:49,549 --> 00:22:51,301
- I killed her, man. I killed her.
- No.

215
00:22:51,385 --> 00:22:54,513
Jesse, look at me. Look at me.

216
00:22:54,721 --> 00:22:56,139
You didn't kill anybody.

217
00:22:57,516 --> 00:22:59,810
I loved her.

218
00:23:02,229 --> 00:23:06,149
I loved her more than anything.

219
00:23:15,742 --> 00:23:20,289
No, no. No.

220
00:24:09,338 --> 00:24:11,538
I haven't given much thought
to the programs.

221
00:24:11,632 --> 00:24:13,842
I guess they should be...

222
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:18,597
I don't know.
Just use your best judgment.

223
00:24:19,932 --> 00:24:22,225
There's no yellow dress here.

224
00:24:22,434 --> 00:24:26,063
It's all... It's all black and grey.

225
00:24:27,898 --> 00:24:30,898
When's the last time you saw her
ever wearing a yellow dress?

226
00:24:32,527 --> 00:24:34,571
What about blue?

227
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:38,075
Blue's better than black, right?

228
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,912
No, no. Not dark blue. More like...

229
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:46,124
Not super-bright, either.

230
00:24:46,333 --> 00:24:48,001
I mean, blue is blue.

231
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:51,797
No. No cleavage.

232
00:24:53,173 --> 00:24:55,092
Long sleeves.

233
00:24:56,677 --> 00:24:59,554
Yeah. It's nice.

234
00:25:01,223 --> 00:25:02,808
It's nice.

235
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,315
Big yawn, Holly.

236
00:25:10,524 --> 00:25:13,527
I know what you feel like.
I'm tired too.

237
00:25:15,821 --> 00:25:18,615
- Okay, sweetie.
- Yes.

238
00:25:21,076 --> 00:25:22,536
Yes!

239
00:25:24,204 --> 00:25:25,205
Here we go.

240
00:25:25,414 --> 00:25:29,042
Here we go. Yes.

241
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:38,468
Would you mind
turning that thing down or off?

242
00:25:39,011 --> 00:25:41,346
Junior. Hey.

243
00:25:42,389 --> 00:25:45,267
The dinging.
Just turn down the volume.

244
00:25:45,475 --> 00:25:50,105
- Dad, it's money.
- Just please do it.

245
00:25:50,314 --> 00:25:52,816
Okay, the noise is disturbing the baby.

246
00:25:55,611 --> 00:25:57,613
Marie, slow down. I can't...

247
00:25:59,781 --> 00:26:02,784
Oh, my God. You are kidding me.

248
00:26:03,285 --> 00:26:06,496
Sure. Of course.
Any day after school.

249
00:26:06,705 --> 00:26:10,500
Okay. Wait. I'm gonna... Let me tell him,
and I'll call you right back.

250
00:26:10,709 --> 00:26:12,085
Okay.

251
00:26:13,795 --> 00:26:15,422
- Guess what.
- What?

252
00:26:15,631 --> 00:26:18,133
- You are gonna be in the newspaper.
- No way.

253
00:26:18,342 --> 00:26:20,468
<i>One of Marie's patients
works at the Journal.</i>

254
00:26:20,552 --> 00:26:22,971
She told him about the website
and the donations,

255
00:26:23,055 --> 00:26:25,390
and they're gonna do a story about you.

256
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:26,600
- For real?
- Yep.

257
00:26:26,808 --> 00:26:29,811
They're coming to interview you
with a photo and everything.

258
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,605
Awesome.

259
00:26:31,813 --> 00:26:36,401
- It'll mean more hits.
- And more contributions.

260
00:26:41,198 --> 00:26:43,116
East of Scottsdale?

261
00:26:43,325 --> 00:26:45,744
Let me guess. Not talking.

262
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,413
Nope. Not a one.

263
00:26:48,622 --> 00:26:51,541
Someone somewhere
is running one tight ship.

264
00:26:53,877 --> 00:26:56,296
All right, chief. Yeah. Thanks a lot.

265
00:26:56,505 --> 00:26:58,257
Yeah. You too.

266
00:27:02,135 --> 00:27:04,053
Agent Schrader, can you spare a moment?

267
00:27:04,137 --> 00:27:06,306
Yes, sir. Absolutely.

268
00:27:09,268 --> 00:27:12,145
Gentlemen, this is
Supervising Agent Hank Schrader.

269
00:27:12,646 --> 00:27:16,441
Agent Schrader, I'd like you to meet
Andrew Coffman of the Adobe Hotel.

270
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:18,526
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

271
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:20,696
Paul Canterna of Canterna Real Estate.

272
00:27:20,904 --> 00:27:22,864
- Hey, it's a pleasure.
- Good to meet you.

273
00:27:22,948 --> 00:27:26,451
And Gustavo Fring of Los Polios Hermanos.

274
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:28,745
- Please, just Gus.
- Hi, Gus.

275
00:27:28,954 --> 00:27:30,747
You guys make some killer chicken.

276
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:32,541
Thank you very much.

277
00:27:32,749 --> 00:27:35,376
These gentlemen are underwriting
this year's Fun Run,

278
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,420
and I thought I would give them a tour.

279
00:27:37,504 --> 00:27:40,215
Absolutely. Get to see
what you're supporting. Thank you.

280
00:27:40,299 --> 00:27:42,509
Can you tell us a little
about your work here?

281
00:27:42,593 --> 00:27:44,094
Yes, the Albuquerque office

282
00:27:44,303 --> 00:27:47,055
covers everything
from drug-related money laundering

283
00:27:47,139 --> 00:27:50,139
to interdiction of illicit substances
crossing the border.

284
00:27:50,475 --> 00:27:53,895
Now, the group that I supervise
focuses on methamphetamine

285
00:27:54,104 --> 00:27:57,107
which is a growing problem
in the country, unfortunately.

286
00:27:57,316 --> 00:27:59,651
- Terrible.
- Yeah. It is indeed.

287
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,560
We've had some successes locally,

288
00:28:01,653 --> 00:28:03,863
but overall,
the supply seems to be growing.

289
00:28:03,947 --> 00:28:07,534
I gotta tell you, community outreach,
like this Fun Run

290
00:28:07,743 --> 00:28:09,911
one of the most powerful weapons we have.

291
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,330
Anything we can do.

292
00:28:11,538 --> 00:28:13,038
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Hank.

293
00:28:13,165 --> 00:28:14,291
- Gentlemen.
- Thanks.

294
00:28:14,499 --> 00:28:16,168
Sure. Thank you.

295
00:28:17,044 --> 00:28:18,837
Is this one of your agents?

296
00:28:19,046 --> 00:28:23,008
Oh, yeah, no, no,
that's my brother-in-law.

297
00:28:23,216 --> 00:28:25,301
He's got a health issue.
We're trying to...

298
00:28:25,385 --> 00:28:28,805
Oh, I'm very sorry.
What sort of health issue?

299
00:28:29,848 --> 00:28:33,644
- Lung cancer.
- Oh, that's a rough one.

300
00:28:34,478 --> 00:28:39,608
- Oh, hey, you don't have to do that.
- Please. Please. I'm happy to do it.

301
00:28:41,693 --> 00:28:43,643
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

302
00:29:02,214 --> 00:29:05,717
Just so you know,
I won't be back for a while.

303
00:29:06,551 --> 00:29:09,513
I'm gonna have my surgery on Friday.

304
00:29:12,099 --> 00:29:14,518
I'm hopeful it'll go well.

305
00:29:16,561 --> 00:29:19,523
But if not,
Saul will take care of things.

306
00:29:19,731 --> 00:29:22,943
He's got your money.
He's keeping it for you.

307
00:29:34,579 --> 00:29:38,583
Look, Jesse, lingering on things
doesn't help, believe me.

308
00:29:38,792 --> 00:29:43,005
Just try and focus
on getting better, okay.

309
00:29:44,006 --> 00:29:46,049
I deserve this.

310
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:48,510
What?

311
00:29:50,429 --> 00:29:53,390
What you said in the desert.

312
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:57,311
I get it, what you meant.

313
00:30:01,523 --> 00:30:03,900
I deserve whatever happens.

314
00:30:24,296 --> 00:30:26,298
Oh, shit.

315
00:30:41,813 --> 00:30:43,482
There he is!

316
00:30:44,232 --> 00:30:47,361
Walt, they're doing a feature
on Walter Jr.

317
00:30:47,569 --> 00:30:49,947
We called you about 50 times.

318
00:30:50,155 --> 00:30:53,533
Marie, I thought we were just talking
about a newspaper story.

319
00:30:53,742 --> 00:30:57,242
<i>I know. But I thought, you know,
if it's good enough for the Journal</i>

320
00:30:57,371 --> 00:31:00,916
then why not TV? So I went for it.

321
00:31:02,292 --> 00:31:03,585
- This is him?
- Yes.

322
00:31:03,794 --> 00:31:05,170
This is Dad. Great.

323
00:31:05,379 --> 00:31:08,756
Let's get everyone on the couch.
I'm thinking Walt Jr. in the middle

324
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,759
Mom and Dad on either side.

325
00:31:10,968 --> 00:31:12,386
Mom and Dad?

326
00:31:14,429 --> 00:31:17,224
How much money have you raised so far?

327
00:31:17,766 --> 00:31:21,478
Six thousand, three hundred
and sixty dollars.

328
00:31:21,687 --> 00:31:23,730
But there's more coming in all the time.

329
00:31:23,939 --> 00:31:26,775
- Wow, that's amazing.
- We don't even know what to say.

330
00:31:26,984 --> 00:31:30,445
It's just... It's been incredible.

331
00:31:30,654 --> 00:31:32,989
Judging from things you have
written about him

332
00:31:33,073 --> 00:31:38,787
- your dad must be quite a guy.
- Yeah. He is. He's the best.

333
00:31:38,996 --> 00:31:41,456
You don't wanna lose him, do you, Walter?

334
00:31:41,665 --> 00:31:45,836
None of us do. We love him.

335
00:31:46,461 --> 00:31:50,799
- He's a good man, isn't he?
- Absolutely. Ask anyone.

336
00:31:51,758 --> 00:31:54,886
Anybody. He's a great father,
a great teacher.

337
00:31:55,095 --> 00:31:57,695
He knows everything there is
to know about chemistry.

338
00:31:58,265 --> 00:32:02,185
He's patient with you,
and he's always there for you.

339
00:32:02,394 --> 00:32:06,857
He's just decent.

340
00:32:07,065 --> 00:32:10,527
And he always does the right thing.

341
00:32:10,736 --> 00:32:14,197
And that's how he teaches me to be.

342
00:32:14,406 --> 00:32:19,202
- Would you say he's your hero?
- Oh, yeah. Yes, ma'am. Totally.

343
00:32:19,411 --> 00:32:22,039
My dad is my hero.

344
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:32,090
Does that put him to sleep?

345
00:32:33,008 --> 00:32:34,760
This one just relaxes him a little.

346
00:32:34,968 --> 00:32:37,846
We're almost ready.
We'll be taking you in, in just a minute.

347
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:39,556
Okay. Thank you.

348
00:32:43,477 --> 00:32:44,728
Well...

349
00:32:46,521 --> 00:32:49,858
- Here we are.
- Yeah.

350
00:33:09,044 --> 00:33:11,964
Relaxed yet?

351
00:33:12,172 --> 00:33:14,299
As a matter of fact...

352
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:23,058
I don't know what this stuff is,
but it's pretty great.

353
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,520
Yeah, it looks like it.

354
00:33:29,356 --> 00:33:31,441
We'll be here when you wake up.

355
00:33:32,401 --> 00:33:35,070
Well, I'll be looking for you.

356
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,948
They'll probably want me
to take your glasses.

357
00:33:38,156 --> 00:33:39,866
Yeah, you better.

358
00:33:40,534 --> 00:33:44,413
Yeah, okay. Okay. I got them.

359
00:33:45,998 --> 00:33:47,958
Where's your phone?

360
00:33:48,166 --> 00:33:50,377
Your cell phone. Did you bring it?

361
00:33:50,586 --> 00:33:52,296
Which one?

362
00:33:55,799 --> 00:34:01,013
I'm pretty sure he didn't bring it, Mom.

363
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:04,975
Okay.

364
00:35:22,219 --> 00:35:23,679
Well, first things first.

365
00:35:23,887 --> 00:35:26,347
How old is that baby now?
When do I get to meet her?

366
00:35:26,431 --> 00:35:29,393
I was actually thinking
of bringing her today, but...

367
00:35:29,601 --> 00:35:31,812
She's 7 weeks tomorrow.

368
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,120
- Seven, right?
- Yeah.

369
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:37,734
Yeah, oh, hey, I have a picture

370
00:35:37,943 --> 00:35:39,778
here somewhere.

371
00:35:41,321 --> 00:35:43,615
- She's beautiful.
- Thanks.

372
00:35:43,824 --> 00:35:46,535
Always a relief to say that
and actually mean it.

373
00:35:47,953 --> 00:35:51,540
- How's your pain level, Walter?
- It's...

374
00:35:51,748 --> 00:35:53,750
Very low, basically.

375
00:35:53,959 --> 00:35:55,836
Shortness of breath?

376
00:35:56,044 --> 00:35:58,797
- A bit, but much better.
- Good.

377
00:35:59,965 --> 00:36:01,717
Well, your margins look good.

378
00:36:01,925 --> 00:36:03,427
I can't foresee the future,

379
00:36:03,635 --> 00:36:05,485
but even conservatively speaking

380
00:36:05,637 --> 00:36:08,487
I can say that you bought yourself
some real time here.

381
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:11,852
There's no reason not to be optimistic.

382
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,854
That's great.

383
00:36:14,313 --> 00:36:17,649
That is great. Thank you, doctor.

384
00:36:19,026 --> 00:36:22,446
So when could he get back
to his normal routine?

385
00:36:22,654 --> 00:36:24,990
- He can ease into it now.
- Okay.

386
00:36:25,198 --> 00:36:30,621
- And can he go back to work or...?
- I'd give it a few more weeks.

387
00:36:31,163 --> 00:36:35,000
Make sure you avoid any heavy lifting
and continue to get plenty of rest.

388
00:36:35,208 --> 00:36:37,794
But he can be on his own?

389
00:36:38,003 --> 00:36:41,256
I mean, just more, you know, independent.

390
00:36:41,715 --> 00:36:44,259
Yes. Use your best judgment.

391
00:36:45,093 --> 00:36:46,386
Well...

392
00:36:46,595 --> 00:36:49,181
Now, that's good news
for you, huh, honey?

393
00:36:49,389 --> 00:36:51,683
One less baby in the house.

394
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:05,238
- Don, hey.
- Hey, Stew.

395
00:37:05,447 --> 00:37:07,908
Hey, welcome back.

396
00:37:08,116 --> 00:37:10,077
Thanks. It's good to be back.

397
00:37:12,204 --> 00:37:16,667
Jesus. We were all so sorry to hear.

398
00:37:17,459 --> 00:37:19,628
Yes. Thanks.

399
00:37:19,962 --> 00:37:22,047
Terrible thing. Just...

400
00:37:22,798 --> 00:37:25,968
But, you know, we've all been
thinking about you, and...

401
00:37:26,176 --> 00:37:28,845
- You been doing okay?
- I'm doing okay.

402
00:37:29,263 --> 00:37:32,766
After a certain point,
time off doesn't help,

403
00:37:32,975 --> 00:37:36,520
so I figured I'd rather be here.

404
00:37:37,062 --> 00:37:41,024
- Focus on work.
- Sure. Absolutely.

405
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:42,985
Yeah.

406
00:37:43,568 --> 00:37:45,988
Well, see you inside.

407
00:37:47,531 --> 00:37:50,993
Continue to descend through 1500.

408
00:37:51,201 --> 00:37:54,204
Headed downwind for a left base
on Runway 17.

409
00:37:54,413 --> 00:37:58,166
Number 26-Tango,
descend to maintain 13,000.

410
00:37:58,375 --> 00:38:02,129
Truth or Consequences altimeter,
two-niner-niner-eight.

411
00:38:02,337 --> 00:38:07,217
Pima 311, contact
Albuquerque Center 134.6.

412
00:38:07,426 --> 00:38:10,929
Juliet-5-Bravo, ident, say altitude.

413
00:38:11,597 --> 00:38:15,767
Juliet-5-Bravo, roger.
Clear direct to Winslow.

414
00:38:15,976 --> 00:38:18,562
I think I may just keep this.

415
00:38:18,812 --> 00:38:19,855
Sky?

416
00:38:21,523 --> 00:38:23,025
What do you think?

417
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,903
Doesn't look so bad, right?

418
00:38:29,197 --> 00:38:30,407
What are you doing?

419
00:38:30,616 --> 00:38:33,160
I'm going to Hank and Marie's
for the weekend.

420
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:37,372
- Since when?
- I'm taking the baby with me.

421
00:38:37,456 --> 00:38:39,506
Marie will pick up
Walter Jr. from school.

422
00:38:40,125 --> 00:38:43,003
You'll have the house to yourself
for two days.

423
00:38:43,629 --> 00:38:46,173
I want you to pack your things and leave.

424
00:38:47,132 --> 00:38:48,383
Why would I do that?

425
00:38:48,592 --> 00:38:51,886
Hank has offered to help. You shouldn't
be doing any heavy lifting.

426
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:54,431
- Skyler.
- I want you gone by Monday morning.

427
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,058
I want...

428
00:38:56,475 --> 00:38:57,684
I want you gone.

429
00:39:07,486 --> 00:39:11,406
Okay. Can you at least tell me why?

430
00:39:12,407 --> 00:39:14,743
Because you're a liar, Walt.

431
00:39:16,912 --> 00:39:18,580
Two cell phones, after all.

432
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,041
What?

433
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:24,335
Before your surgery, I asked
if you had packed your cell phone,

434
00:39:24,419 --> 00:39:28,298
and you said, "Which one?"

435
00:39:29,549 --> 00:39:30,759
When?

436
00:39:30,968 --> 00:39:33,512
Skyler, I was medicated.

437
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,920
I mean, I could have said
the world was flat.

438
00:39:36,098 --> 00:39:37,198
You know what I think?

439
00:39:39,017 --> 00:39:42,187
I think you accidentally told the truth.

440
00:39:42,562 --> 00:39:45,274
Honey, we have been over this.

441
00:39:45,482 --> 00:39:47,442
Asked and answered, right?

442
00:39:47,651 --> 00:39:50,570
Then it got me thinking again

443
00:39:50,779 --> 00:39:54,366
about all the strange behaviour.

444
00:39:54,574 --> 00:39:57,035
Not the least of which
was the disappearance.

445
00:39:57,244 --> 00:39:59,705
Out of my mind with worry,
calling hospitals

446
00:39:59,913 --> 00:40:01,832
checking the morgue.

447
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:04,835
Your fugue state?

448
00:40:07,421 --> 00:40:10,007
I had to believe that, didn't I?

449
00:40:10,507 --> 00:40:12,968
I had to find a way.

450
00:40:13,927 --> 00:40:18,849
I mean, who would lie about such a thing?

451
00:40:19,558 --> 00:40:20,851
You tell me, Skyler.

452
00:40:21,059 --> 00:40:24,146
You tell me exactly what it is
you think I'm lying about.

453
00:40:24,646 --> 00:40:27,524
What? I'm having an affair.
Is that what you think?

454
00:40:27,733 --> 00:40:29,943
Yeah. For the last few weeks.

455
00:40:30,152 --> 00:40:32,821
With whom?
Who am I having an affair with?

456
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:35,407
Well, my guess was Gretchen Schwartz.

457
00:40:36,199 --> 00:40:39,953
Something was going on between you.
I just knew.

458
00:40:40,162 --> 00:40:43,707
Jesus. Skyler. Get me a Bible
to swear on, if that's what it takes.

459
00:40:43,916 --> 00:40:45,834
I am not having an affair with Gretchen.

460
00:40:45,918 --> 00:40:48,962
I know. I know you're not.
Because I asked her.

461
00:40:52,758 --> 00:40:55,176
It really took me forever
to get in touch with her.

462
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:57,179
She was ducking my calls for weeks.

463
00:40:58,138 --> 00:40:59,556
So I finally left a message:

464
00:40:59,765 --> 00:41:03,602
"What exactly is going on
between you and my husband?"

465
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:06,229
I thought that'd get her attention,
and it did.

466
00:41:06,438 --> 00:41:10,025
So she called me back,
and she finally told me.

467
00:41:11,526 --> 00:41:13,904
The money for your treatment

468
00:41:15,197 --> 00:41:19,117
Gretchen and Elliott
didn't give you a dime.

469
00:41:20,786 --> 00:41:22,537
They paid for nothing.

470
00:41:22,746 --> 00:41:25,165
You refused every offer they made you.

471
00:41:25,374 --> 00:41:26,791
But that didn't make sense

472
00:41:26,875 --> 00:41:29,460
because I checked with Delcavoli
and the hospital,

473
00:41:29,544 --> 00:41:32,839
and not including your surgery

474
00:41:33,048 --> 00:41:35,050
we're nearly paid up.

475
00:41:35,384 --> 00:41:38,095
Over $100,000.

476
00:41:39,554 --> 00:41:43,934
Out of where? Out of thin air?

477
00:41:52,401 --> 00:41:54,152
But then

478
00:41:55,612 --> 00:41:57,823
I called your mother.

479
00:41:59,908 --> 00:42:01,451
Yeah.

480
00:42:02,494 --> 00:42:04,329
Thanks for that too.

481
00:42:04,997 --> 00:42:07,457
But I thought, you know,
maybe she has some money

482
00:42:07,541 --> 00:42:11,628
that I don't know about.
Maybe she contributed.

483
00:42:13,005 --> 00:42:14,881
It's possible.

484
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:21,513
It turns out that not only is the money
not from your mother

485
00:42:21,722 --> 00:42:26,768
she didn't even know
that you have cancer.

486
00:42:30,022 --> 00:42:32,316
You never went to see her.

487
00:42:33,984 --> 00:42:36,194
I dropped you at the airport.
I picked you up.

488
00:42:36,278 --> 00:42:37,778
You were gone for four days,

489
00:42:37,904 --> 00:42:41,700
and yet she swears

490
00:42:42,242 --> 00:42:44,536
that you were never there.

491
00:42:49,291 --> 00:42:53,629
Lies on top of lies on top of lies.

492
00:42:55,547 --> 00:42:56,548
Skyler.

493
00:42:57,633 --> 00:42:59,426
Could you

494
00:43:00,385 --> 00:43:02,346
just once...

495
00:43:05,223 --> 00:43:08,936
do me the courtesy of not denying it?

496
00:43:18,111 --> 00:43:19,696
Skyler.

497
00:43:21,365 --> 00:43:23,033
Skyler, don't do this, please.

498
00:43:23,241 --> 00:43:25,494
I...

499
00:43:26,078 --> 00:43:28,622
Skyler, please don't go.

500
00:43:37,464 --> 00:43:42,177
If I tell you the truth, will you stay?

501
00:43:44,263 --> 00:43:47,099
Stay, and I will tell you everything.

502
00:43:48,433 --> 00:43:50,269
Whatever it is

503
00:43:51,395 --> 00:43:53,355
I'm afraid to know.

504
