00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,368
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

2
00:00:03,462 --> 00:00:04,452
Council of Wells.

3
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:06,503
Some of the brightest minds
in all the multi-verse.

4
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:09,549
There's still another cryogenic
anomaly in my DNA.

5
00:00:09,635 --> 00:00:10,796
Killer Frost is still a part of you.

6
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:13,924
The more I try to use my brain,
the sooner I'm going to lose it.

7
00:00:14,056 --> 00:00:15,137
<i>I know what DeVoe's doing.</i>

8
00:00:15,224 --> 00:00:17,716
Separate satellites working together
for a single purpose?

9
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:20,017
DeVoe wants to remove the
intelligence of everyone on Earth?

10
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:21,093
Just like mine.

11
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:32,813
Iris?

12
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:34,740
Sorry, babe.
Go back to sleep.

13
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:47,828
Iris.

14
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:49,004
All right. Just...

15
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:50,332
Just one second. Let me just...

16
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:53,752
Let me just get this
last sentence done, okay?

17
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:55,802
Why are you still awake?
What is all this?

18
00:00:55,889 --> 00:01:00,259
This is every file, every report,
every footnote

19
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:01,388
that I could find on DeVoe.

20
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:03,219
I dug it all up when I woke up
in the middle of the night.

21
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:07,728
I just... I couldn't stop thinking
about DeVoe and his machine,

22
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:09,184
and now that he has
all of the satellites,

23
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:11,190
I mean, he could turn on the machine
at any point.

24
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,067
And not knowing is maddening,

25
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,273
but at least I know
what he's planned, right?

26
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:17,529
But everyone else in the city,
they are oblivious.

27
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:21,739
Which is why I decided that
I need to write a piece about it.

28
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:26,535
- An article?
- Exposing every single detail

29
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:28,119
- of his maniacal plan.
- Um...

30
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:31,001
I think that if people in this city
knew what he was up to,

31
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,627
then maybe they could
protect themselves.

32
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:35,335
Barry, I really think
this is exactly what we need

33
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:36,636
to change the tide against DeVoe.

34
00:01:37,139 --> 00:01:39,131
So, I'm gonna go upstairs,
I'm gonna take a shower,

35
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:40,931
and when I come back, I need you
to tell me everything you know

36
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:44,557
about that flying chair
and how he uses it to body hop and...

37
00:01:52,738 --> 00:01:55,151
So, last night, Harry,
Cisco and I were up all night

38
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,027
running all the different algorithms
we could think of

39
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,983
involving the satellite tech
that DeVoe stole.

40
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:02,320
We think DeVoe plans to position
each of his five satellites

41
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:04,326
at specifically calculated points
around the globe.

42
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,624
And when the quantum computers
in each satellite link up...

43
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:11,330
He'll use that network to basically
emit a series of dark matter bursts.

44
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:13,335
That will reboot the prefrontal cortex

45
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:15,166
of every man, woman and child
on this Earth.

46
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:17,343
Well, we need
to nip this in the bud.

47
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:19,091
We can't let him launch
those satellites.

48
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:21,635
Yeah, but I mean, how are we
supposed to find him?

49
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:23,057
I mean, we haven't been able to register

50
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,135
DeVoe's pocket dimension energy
for days.

51
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,971
And with Null's gravitational powers
he can launch these satellites

52
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:29,727
from any place at any time.

53
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,390
Yeah, he can.

54
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:32,817
What are you thinking, Barr?

55
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,436
I think we shoot 'em down.

56
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,646
- Whoa.
- There is one small problem.

57
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,902
DeVoe has Kilg%re's powers.

58
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:42,030
Yeah, he can manipulate
any tech-based weapon we fire at him.

59
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,406
So, we don't use tech.

60
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:46,831
We use some kind of
organic matter weapon.

61
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:48,624
Right. Like a...

62
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:50,993
Like a...

63
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:54,422
You know what, let's split up,
see what we can find.

64
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,710
Ramon.

65
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,889
DeVoe's not acting.
Why is he not acting?

66
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,683
I don't know, but it doesn't matter.

67
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:07,886
But it does matter.

68
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,515
Oh, and if I had my intelligence,

69
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:10,687
I could figure that out.

70
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:12,140
But I don't. I gotta get it back.

71
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:14,476
No, no, no.
What you need to do is be patient.

72
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:17,277
We're consulting with, like,
literally every scientist we know.

73
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:18,400
Will you consult with me?

74
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:22,658
- Harry...
- No, not... not dumb me.

75
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:23,734
The other mes.

76
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:26,654
The Council?

77
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:29,540
So, I must admit
I found your transmission

78
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,834
intriguing to say the least.

79
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,910
But first,

80
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:36,498
I have a question for you, Harry Wells.

81
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:41,545
Tell me, Harry, how did your
"hypothetical" thinking cap

82
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:46,174
account for the resonant inductive
coupling of the dark matter transfer?

83
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,685
- Well...
- The inductive coupling...

84
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:51,395
Am I speaking to you? I cannot remember.

85
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:52,688
Oh, wait. I'm not.

86
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:54,807
Little guy they must call "Cisco,"

87
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,813
put you in a box,
put the box in the pocket.

88
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,439
Talking to Harry. Simple question.

89
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:02,524
How does it account
for the resonant coupling?

90
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,109
It, uh...

91
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,863
Ah!

92
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,078
I knew it. He doesn't know.

93
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,246
He doesn't know.

94
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,085
Oh! Simple Harry
is truly Simple Harry now.

95
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:19,336
No, that's not what's happening.

96
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,918
<i>Ja.</i> Remember I put you in a box,
put the box in the pocket.

97
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:24,595
Crushed the box in the pocket.

98
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,217
This is very simple, what has happened,

99
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:28,846
your "hypothetical" thinking cap
has malfunctioned

100
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:34,264
and left a Wells, a once formidable
intellect, a dumdum.

101
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,062
- That's not what happened.
- Yeah, that's what happened.

102
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:38,734
That's what happened.

103
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,061
Poor Harry.

104
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:42,521
<i>- Herr</i> Wells.
<i>- Ja.</i>

105
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:44,528
Are you gonna help us or not?

106
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:47,694
- Not.
- Why not?

107
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:51,706
The Council of Wells is a council
of superior intellects

108
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:56,503
there to accept the challenge
of others with superior intellects.

109
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:59,831
It's called the "Council of Wells,"
and not the "Council of Dumdums!"

110
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:01,291
- Look at this man.
- I see him.

111
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:02,625
Is he not one of your own?

112
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:05,420
Are you telling me that you're gonna
betray one of your own

113
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:09,679
because he doesn't meet some
arbitrary intellectual standard?

114
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,137
So you do understand.

115
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:13,060
<i>Ja,</i> unlike your simple friend,

116
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,058
here's what you now must consider.

117
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:18,228
<i>Auf wiedersehen.</i>

118
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:20,693
He's right.

119
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:22,061
I am a dumdum.

120
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,021
Hey, you are not a dumdum.

121
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:26,072
Ramon, come on. Let's face facts.

122
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,116
I've lost most of my science,
lost most of my math.

123
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:29,193
Language will be next,

124
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,323
and there's nothing we can do about it.

125
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:32,746
On the contrary, <i>mon frere.</i>

126
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,246
We're the ones who created that
council of dingdongs

127
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,327
in the first place,
so if they're not gonna help us,

128
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:39,791
that leaves us with one other option.

129
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:43,166
A new council. A smarter council.

130
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:45,546
A better council.

131
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:48,970
<i>Hey, Caitlin.</i>

132
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,553
Do you have any ibuprofen?

133
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:55,512
Reading up on all this organic matter
is giving me an organic migraine.

134
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:57,388
Thanks.

135
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,184
You have a little...

136
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:02,894
Oh, acupuncture.

137
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:06,197
Ever since I found out I still have
a cryogenic anomaly in my DNA,

138
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:08,946
I've been doing every medical avenue
I can think of

139
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:10,697
to get Killer Frost to emerge.

140
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,528
Mmm. You really do miss her, don't you?

141
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:14,538
Yeah. Killer Frost was a part of me,

142
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,206
and just as I was starting
to accept her,

143
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:17,500
she was taken away.

144
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,414
I'm running out of ideas.

145
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:23,714
Hmm. Well, I know
it's not exactly the same,

146
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,713
but I've had my fair share
of missing persons cases.

147
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,294
And what do you do
when you've hit a wall?

148
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:32,132
I try to attack it from
a different direction.

149
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:33,674
If that helps.

150
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,141
Anyway, thanks.

151
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:44,018
<i>We've been attacking this
from the wrong direction.</i>

152
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:47,147
We know we need a tech-free projectile

153
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,606
to stop DeVoe's satellites.

154
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,111
We've been looking for an object

155
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,284
when what we really need is a person.

156
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:55,200
Amunet.

157
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,452
- Amunet Black?
- I know she's not the ideal choice,

158
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,829
but Amunet's psychic-powered
alnico shards

159
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,456
are not only deadly powerful,

160
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:04,289
they're completely immune
to DeVoe's Kilg%re powers.

161
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:07,546
Not ideal? I mean, she kidnapped you.

162
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:09,593
She tried to sell me into meta slavery.

163
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,420
And she ruined my bachelorette party.

164
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:12,504
- I mean...
- That's not...

165
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,386
I mean, you're right.
It's admittedly not as big of a deal,

166
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:15,466
but you know what I'm saying.

167
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,971
Yeah, we can't partner up with Amunet.

168
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:18,052
She's a criminal.

169
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,304
Snart's a criminal, so is Killer Frost.

170
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:21,559
We worked with them.

171
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,186
All right, look...

172
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,277
Look, even if we forgave Amunet
for everything she's done...

173
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:27,524
Which is a lot.

174
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,527
What makes you say
she'd be willing to help us?

175
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:33,030
I've seen a different side of her.
She's helped me before,

176
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,826
and I believe she'll do it again.

177
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:52,216
This isn't what I expected
Amunet's hideout to look like.

178
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,012
I might have made a few changes.

179
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,342
- What...
- Really, boys?

180
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,597
You're trying to get us killed?
That's the Flash, you morons.

181
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:05,354
And Caitlin may look like a librarian,

182
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,477
but she's a coldhearted beast.

183
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:08,606
Where's Amunet?

184
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:09,937
Really?

185
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:14,242
No "Hello, Norvok, how you been?"

186
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:17,574
You're not even gonna introduce me
to your new boss?

187
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,451
I'm not her boss, I'm just a friend.

188
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,157
Well, isn't that sweet.

189
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,249
Norvok, where is Amunet?

190
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,123
No one's heard a peep from her
in months.

191
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:26,669
For all I know,

192
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,622
the witch is dead.

193
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,801
So, Amunet's gone?

194
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:39,975
Well, apparently, after her deal with
Warden Wolfe took a nosedive,

195
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,677
she's been out of
the meta trafficking business.

196
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,520
Caitlin, you know any personal details

197
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:44,596
that can help us track her down?

198
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:45,723
Ooh, I don't know.

199
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:49,731
Amunet's always been a private person,
sort of unpredictable and rash.

200
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:52,029
Kind of fly by the seat of your pants.

201
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,282
You know, when she kidnapped me
at Christmas,

202
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,950
she said she used to be
a flight attendant.

203
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,278
I think she was on an airplane

204
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,907
the night
the particle accelerator exploded.

205
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:01,990
Okay, that we can work with. Let's see.

206
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:06,665
Yeah, looks like there were
35 flights in the air in Central City

207
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:08,462
the night of
the particle accelerator explosion.

208
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,547
Cisco, can you access
the flight manifests?

209
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:13,250
Yes, I can,
and I can take the crew's credentials...

210
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:14,960
Cross reference them
in the facial recognition?

211
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:16,262
Can you not read my mind?

212
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:17,337
I didn't, um...

213
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:21,555
- Ah.
- Her real name is Leslie Jocoy?

214
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,311
Maybe she's operating under
her real name, not her pseudonym.

215
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,513
Well, she didn't have a criminal record

216
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:27,223
until the particle accelerator,

217
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:28,892
so it's not a bad plan.

218
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:32,858
C.C.P.D.'s database has several prior
work addresses for Leslie Jocoy.

219
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:33,983
All right, let's pay them all a visit.

220
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,190
Okay. Dad, why don't you and Caitlin

221
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:36,490
go and check out
the most recent address?

222
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,400
- I'll check out the rest.
- Sounds like a plan.

223
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,862
And I should get back to the loft.
I need to pick up the DeVoe file

224
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,238
- for my article...
- Hey, actually, um,

225
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:44,494
can I, um,
just talk to you really quick?

226
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,826
Uh, yeah, okay.

227
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,627
<i>Just about your article.</i>

228
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,454
I just think maybe

229
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:53,541
telling everybody about
a meta-human uber-genius

230
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:56,214
who plans on rebooting
people's brains...

231
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:57,587
Yeah, but if we don't tell them,

232
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,296
they might find out when it's too late.

233
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:02,217
Sure, but I don't... I mean,
the team's always liked to keep

234
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,517
what we're working on low-key.

235
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,262
Okay, well, I'll run the idea by them.

236
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:08,598
No. I don't mean no, I just mean...

237
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:11,017
Maybe hold off until
you finish writing it.

238
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,066
Okay, yeah, I'll hold off.

239
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:16,734
- You will?
- Yeah.

240
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:17,856
No, I mean, I get it.

241
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:20,364
We've never openly shared this kind
of information with the city before...

242
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,819
- Right.
- And the team will be

243
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:22,903
more likely to agree with me

244
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:25,535
if I have a full article ready
for them to read, so...

245
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,658
I'm gonna hurry up and finish it.

246
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:29,577
- Okay.
- Thanks.

247
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:34,214
Harry, I give to you

248
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,959
the emotionally astute
Council of Harrisons.

249
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,260
- Hey.
- There you are.

250
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,005
H. Wells, what are you doing here?

251
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,343
Those other stiffs,

252
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:45,267
well, they got tired of my connections.

253
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:48,396
Making me tardy to their party, so...

254
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,562
They gave me the boot.

255
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,940
Give you the...
Wait, so I'm not the only one?

256
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,310
Nuh-uh. All of us have been kicked out.

257
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:56,854
All of you have been...

258
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,356
You got me a council of rejects.

259
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,690
Oh, they're brilliant rejects.

260
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,821
Hey, whoa, whoa.
Who you calling rejects?

261
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,994
Hey, look at this guy.
What are you? <i>Stunad?</i>

262
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:06,747
Allow myself to introduce myself.

263
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:10,827
- Sunny Wells, Earth-24...
- At your service.

264
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,458
They call me "Sunny" on account
of my sunny disposition.

265
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:15,756
You know what,
I think that name kind of works for him.

266
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,254
The guy who must be Cisco. Hey.

267
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,840
My motto, personally?

268
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,637
For me, my motto,

269
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:23,714
"Be kind.

270
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:25,716
"Rewind."

271
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:27,844
"Be kind. Rewind"?

272
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,053
They're still on VHS.

273
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:31,013
What?

274
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,440
Hello, yes. <i>Bonjour.</i>

275
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,811
So, I am Harrison H.P. Wells

276
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:38,021
of the Earth-<i>vingt cinq.</i>

277
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:41,528
So, I must say that it warms me

278
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,990
to see us all bonded by our faces
and our hearts.

279
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,069
See his scarf? I like that scarf.

280
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,414
I'm gonna get myself one of them
classy scarfs like this guy.

281
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:50,536
That's a $10 scarf right there.

282
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,585
So, anyway, without further ado,

283
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:56,459
it's time for me
to commence this meeting

284
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:59,087
with one of my poems, so, <i>allez.</i>

285
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,126
"I never knew you.

286
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:02,845
"I never taste you."

287
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:03,921
Taste...

288
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:05,096
"I never smell you.

289
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,181
"Until I do.

290
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:10,306
"And now, I am hookted."

291
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:13,146
Mmm. Saucy.

292
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:16,232
And, uh, what is this poem about?

293
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:18,185
- Bread.
- Ah, deep connection.

294
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,316
Food can...
feed the soul.

295
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,739
You know, I once had this experience
with a hot apple pie...

296
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:25,442
Okay, you know what,
that's enough, uh, sharing

297
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:26,947
from this side of the table.

298
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:29,576
How about we let somebody else share?
Harry, you have the floor.

299
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:30,656
- No chance.
- Harry.

300
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,740
- No way.
- Come on.

301
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,041
- Come on.
- Do the intro.

302
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:34,159
Why? No.

303
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,624
- I'm not gonna... What?
- Harry.

304
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:40,007
You have to do the sharing
if you want the helping. Okay?

305
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,083
<i>Allez,</i> Harry.

306
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:42,793
Hey.

307
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,013
- I'm Harry.
- How you doing, Harry?

308
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,136
<i>- Bonjour,</i> Harry.
- Howdy, Harry.

309
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:49,467
We know his name.

310
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:50,884
So, uh...

311
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:52,552
Here's the thing.

312
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,181
I'm losing my intelligence.

313
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,732
- Whoa!
- Oh, no.

314
00:12:56,985 --> 00:13:01,070
And as Wellses, you know how
very important our intelligence is,

315
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:04,361
and so I'm asking for your help
to get my intelligence back,

316
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,941
so I can kick some...

317
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,947
So I can help my team.

318
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,116
- Will you help me do that?
<i>- Non.</i>

319
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,410
<i>Non, mais...</i> Of course, Harry.

320
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:16,202
Of course, we will help him.
We will help you. Open your heart.

321
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:17,703
We'll open your mind.

322
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:19,292
Come on, let's do this.

323
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:22,416
- Okay.
- Lovely.

324
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,056
Hey, Barr, we're at the market.

325
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,133
We'll let you know if we find her.

326
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:33,181
<i>- Copy that.</i>
- Amunet used to work here?

327
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:35,058
What did she do? Bag groceries?

328
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,018
At least it's not human trafficking.

329
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:39,808
Let's look around.

330
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:46,607
Hey, look, when I told you
to look in a different direction

331
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:48,359
to find your alter ego,

332
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,445
I didn't mean team up with a criminal.

333
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:52,996
I know how that probably looks.

334
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,449
Yeah, it looks like you want us
to work with Amunet Black

335
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,409
so she can help you with
your Killer Frost problem.

336
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:00,709
I mean, why weren't you up front
with the team about that?

337
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:03,165
Because I thought they'd say no
if I had my own reasons.

338
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,922
And besides, I actually really do think

339
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:07,378
Amunet can help us

340
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:09,213
and help me with
my Killer Frost problem.

341
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:10,923
Well, how exactly can she help you?

342
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:14,143
Last year when I was having trouble
getting a handle on Killer Frost,

343
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,218
I went to her.

344
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:18,806
She used a black market
piece of tech on me, a splicer,

345
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,061
helped me split Killer Frost.

346
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:21,562
So you're hoping
she still has this tech.

347
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,185
It worked before, it can work again.

348
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,111
Well, Caitlin, you gotta tell the team.

349
00:14:25,135 --> 00:14:27,135
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

350
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:50,087
Damn.

351
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,923
- Somebody saw <i>Molly's Game.</i>
- Mm-hmm.

352
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,602
Hang on a second.

353
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:07,734
C.C.P.D.! This is an illegal operation.
Everybody out of the room.

354
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:11,821
Leslie.

355
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:14,444
Caity.

356
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:20,076
Leave it to your crafty little brain
to figure out my dark secret.

357
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:21,494
What are you doing here?

358
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:22,703
Calling your bluff.

359
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:23,913
I knew you were still alive.

360
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:25,998
No one could kill me.

361
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:27,833
What's with the accent?

362
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,714
It's part of my disguise.

363
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:30,965
Had to blend in.

364
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:34,799
Now I'm just your average American
blonde making an honest living.

365
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:36,633
Well,

366
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,183
a more honest living, yeah?

367
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,897
Besides, you know what they say,

368
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:45,525
"A zebra never changes it's stripes."

369
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,269
Flash.

370
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,401
Oh! Flash.

371
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,116
You really do stop all the crime
in the city, don't you?

372
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:56,866
But not today.

373
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:13,004
I'm not here to fight.

374
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:16,798
We need your help.

375
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:25,148
Oh, look, a little hidey-hole
for your outfit.

376
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,817
Hi, excuse me.

377
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:30,521
You don't seem too concerned
that DeVoe is about to launch

378
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:32,151
a bunch of satellites into space

379
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,652
that are going to reset
all of our brains.

380
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:36,486
Oh, no, my dear.
I find it very troubling.

381
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:39,447
The professor turning everyone
in the world into a dimwit

382
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,872
is tragic.

383
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:44,585
It's brilliant, but tragic.

384
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:45,998
So, will you work with us?

385
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:47,628
Help us stop DeVoe?

386
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:48,955
Just...

387
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:53,502
That thing...
Why do you still have it on?

388
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:55,883
My...

389
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:58,598
It helps me protect my identity.

390
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:01,810
No, it's doing
a terrible job.

391
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,603
What?

392
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:06,853
Yeah, you see that stoic jaw line,

393
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:09,609
patrician profile.

394
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,480
You're so obviously the speedster
I tried to procure

395
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:14,564
from the Warden.

396
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:16,658
May he RIP.

397
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:22,656
Come on.

398
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,740
Yeah, I'm doing it.

399
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:29,166
- Hello, handsome.
- Hello.

400
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:33,463
To think I had the Flash in my grasp.

401
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:36,170
What a pretty penny I could have
gotten for that sale.

402
00:17:36,264 --> 00:17:37,755
- Amunet.
- Yes?

403
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:38,838
Focus.

404
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:41,428
Okay, so...

405
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:45,353
On the one hand,
I am more dictator than team player.

406
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,480
But on the other,

407
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:52,812
Professor DeVoe stupefying the planet
would be bad for business.

408
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:54,813
So, I'll do it.

409
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:58,199
Unfortunately, there is a but.

410
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:00,114
There usually is one.

411
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:05,165
You see, in life I have found
that bigger isn't always better.

412
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,538
But in this case...

413
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:10,416
You need more shards to take out
something the size of a satellite.

414
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:11,496
So where'd you get those?

415
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:16,043
From the plane I was on the night
the particle accelerator exploded.

416
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:18,880
They were in the cargo bay
en route to a military facility.

417
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,553
Which conveniently never made it
to its final destination.

418
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,685
You see, normally I would just
pop down to my storage locker

419
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,182
to grab my big job stash.

420
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:29,310
But last week, a naughty boy

421
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,064
or girl
or non-binary gendered individual

422
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:34,895
snuck in and robbed the place.

423
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:36,446
Well, we should check out
your storage unit.

424
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:37,613
There might still be some clues.

425
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,817
I think I have an old CSI kit
back at the apartment.

426
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:43,241
Great. You guys are so good.

427
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:45,869
Um, sorry, excuse me, um,
where, where are you going?

428
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:49,000
Um, to the kitchen for a spot of tea.

429
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:51,703
Why don't I take you?

430
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:56,629
Mm... Boy.

431
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:00,591
Oh! You prepare food in here?

432
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:02,718
It's not very sanitary.

433
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,424
I wanted to talk to you alone.

434
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:07,393
I didn't just bring you here
to help us stop DeVoe.

435
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:09,729
An ulterior motive.

436
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,602
How furtive and apropos.

437
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:16,320
After all, why go through
all the hassle of procuring me

438
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,146
when Killer Frost could quite easily

439
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,778
just ice blast those satellites down.

440
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:22,485
Killer Frost is gone.

441
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:24,820
I haven't been able to get her to appear

442
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:26,450
ever since DeVoe used
one of his powers on her.

443
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:30,409
Remember last year when I came to you
because Killer Frost was taking over?

444
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:32,369
You fixed me.

445
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:38,292
My trans-modular genetic splicer.

446
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:39,922
I need to use that splicer again.

447
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:42,930
Caity.

448
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:46,224
One of the reasons why I was so
willing to help you and your friends

449
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:51,430
with your professor situation
is because, well, quite literally,

450
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,391
it also benefits me.

451
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:57,861
But giving you my splicer,

452
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:00,526
not as beneficial.

453
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:02,445
What if I make you a deal?

454
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:05,114
You give me the splicer,

455
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:08,075
Killer Frost and I
will do you one favor.

456
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,415
Oh, that is a tempting offer.

457
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:15,871
But unfortunately,
my splicer was stashed

458
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:17,957
right alongside my additional shards.

459
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,382
In your ransacked storage unit.

460
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:24,050
Okay, wherever we find your shards,
we should also find the splicer.

461
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:26,177
- Ding, ding, ding.
- So, do we have a deal?

462
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,971
You'll give me the splicer
as soon as we recover it?

463
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,807
I'll even tie a little bow on it.

464
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,648
Ladies and gentlemen,
hang on to your wigs and keys.

465
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:36,566
Here we go. Harry, turn to him,

466
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:38,777
the guy who must be Cisco,
express yourself.

467
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:41,571
Yes, it's best you commence with
"I feel" statements.

468
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,657
Like, "I feel a yearning."

469
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,151
Or "I feel aroused."

470
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,069
Okay...

471
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,117
How is this gonna make me
smarter than DeVoe?

472
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:52,790
Hey! Again with DeVoe.
Why are you so hung up on this mamaluke?

473
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:56,583
I think that DeVoe for you,
this is a guy that has,

474
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,959
well, he is like a leech upon you.

475
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:02,922
Sucking and sucking and sucking
and sucking and sucking.

476
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:05,880
And all you are left with is doubt.

477
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:08,716
I like that.
Nature, red in tooth and claw.

478
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:10,801
You know, they say to understand
a man's actions,

479
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:11,931
you gotta understand his heart.

480
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,937
Okay, question.

481
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:19,602
How do you understand the heart
of a deranged maniac?

482
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:22,021
The guy who must be Cisco
makes a good point here.

483
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,527
Let's all close our eyes
and take a moment

484
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:28,452
to imagine we are all sociopaths
trying to conquer the world.

485
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:29,653
Ah, yes.

486
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:31,863
What is...

487
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:35,871
Oh, <i>mais,</i> Harry.

488
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:38,791
Go on, <i>allez,</i>
put yourself in DeVoe's shoes.

489
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:40,247
Close your eyes, Harry.

490
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:48,175
Now, what do you see?

491
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,682
What do you smell?

492
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:52,843
How'd he feel?

493
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,099
Dumb. Dumb.

494
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:57,522
This is not making me any smarter.

495
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:00,191
But aren't you smarter, Harry?

496
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:03,311
You must channel your aggression
into love.

497
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:05,234
I feel like you're mocking me.

498
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:08,275
Oh, an "I feel" statement.
Winner. Winner.

499
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:09,860
All right. All right.

500
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:11,536
Progress, on that note...

501
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:15,206
Wait, wait. We're not done here, are we?

502
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:16,999
- Yeah. Yeah. We're done.
- Yeah, we're done.

503
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,159
<i>Oui. C'est fini.</i>

504
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:20,211
No. No. No. Nothing's <i>fini.</i>

505
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:21,413
Now, Harry.

506
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:23,464
You know what they say about
all work and no play.

507
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,208
Leaves no time for making whoopee.

508
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:27,923
And there he goes.

509
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,930
Look, H.P., come on. We're not...
We haven't done anything.

510
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:32,932
<i>Non, non, mon frere. Desole, huh?</i>

511
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:36,178
Parting, such sweet sorrow,
but I must bid you <i>adieu.</i>

512
00:22:36,564 --> 00:22:38,476
Harry, from Earth-2, <i>adieu.</i>

513
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:43,276
Harry, everything you need,

514
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:47,072
you got it right in there.
Remember, you're unbelievable.

515
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:51,034
Ramon, remind me again.

516
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:54,450
What... what's another word for "huge"?

517
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:57,373
Colossal.

518
00:22:57,668 --> 00:22:59,409
Colossal. Great. Thank you.

519
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:04,006
This was a colossal waste of time!

520
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:16,263
Here we are.

521
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,724
This is where you kept
your stash?

522
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:21,514
Well, I got something.

523
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:25,398
Some kind of substance on the lock pin.

524
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:28,070
Looks like they applied it
to break the door open.

525
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:31,366
Young man, David Caruso's
got nothing on you.

526
00:23:31,702 --> 00:23:33,364
Nice.

527
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:40,704
What is it?

528
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:42,877
Acid? Cyanide?

529
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,121
Oh, oh! Is it anthrax?

530
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:49,634
Hematoxic venom.

531
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,010
That grotty, mangy, plug-ugly brat
dare betray me?

532
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:59,226
I take it she knows who did this.

533
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:01,020
Yup, and so do you.

534
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:02,896
Norvok.

535
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:06,522
And I guarantee that snake for brains
will suffer.

536
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:15,740
If Norvok thinks he can steal from me
and get away with it,

537
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:17,786
he's got another thing coming.

538
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:19,122
I can't believe this is happening.

539
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:20,198
Satellite's not picking up

540
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:22,249
any of your alnico metal
anywhere in the city.

541
00:24:22,336 --> 00:24:24,578
Norvok may be a moron,
but he's not stupid enough

542
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:26,038
to keep the stash out in the open.

543
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,214
Hey, did you find anything?

544
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,213
Nope. Norvok and the boxers weren't
there at the ring anymore.

545
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,464
Of course not.

546
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:35,839
Because you and your gang of heroes
tipped him off that something was up.

547
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:38,175
Have you expanded the satellites
beyond Central City?

548
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:39,258
Yeah.

549
00:24:39,353 --> 00:24:40,889
What about trying facial recognition?

550
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:41,970
Yes, of course.

551
00:24:42,064 --> 00:24:44,477
And what about a geological scan
of the metal signature like last time

552
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:46,558
or having Cisco run another algorithm

553
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:48,143
to check the electromagnetic fields
in the city?

554
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:51,025
Yes, Caitlin. I've done all that.
I've run all the tests.

555
00:24:51,782 --> 00:24:53,318
Bit testy with that, Frost, just...

556
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:54,775
We're doing everything we can,
all right?

557
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:56,450
We're gonna find Norvok and the shards.

558
00:24:58,872 --> 00:24:59,862
Caitlin.

559
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:04,247
Is this about her stolen shards
or her tech?

560
00:25:05,963 --> 00:25:07,454
What? What tech?

561
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:12,258
Amunet has splicer technology

562
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,461
that she used to split
Killer Frost last year.

563
00:25:14,555 --> 00:25:17,263
I was hoping to use it again
to get Killer Frost to come out,

564
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:21,093
but it was hidden with her metal
shards in the storage container.

565
00:25:21,562 --> 00:25:22,769
Why wouldn't
you tell us that?

566
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:26,063
Because I made Amunet a deal.

567
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:28,642
If she helped me, Killer Frost would
do another job for her.

568
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:31,193
Well, that splicer tech
isn't your only hope.

569
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,487
Yes, it is, Joe.

570
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:34,030
I have tried everything that
I can think of

571
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:35,232
to get Killer Frost to appear,

572
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:36,861
and that was my last shot.

573
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:38,693
So, now she's gone for good.

574
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:50,668
Those weirdos
with their feelings.

575
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:52,215
I'm done talking about my feelings.

576
00:25:56,013 --> 00:25:57,003
What's your problem?

577
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:58,759
No. It just looked like
you were gonna...

578
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:00,056
What is this?
What are you doing?

579
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:01,929
I am cleaning up my workstation

580
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:03,055
'cause I'm not gonna need it anymore

581
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:04,852
since I'm not getting
my intelligence back.

582
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:06,475
You don't know that.

583
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,181
I don't know that?
Oh, I don't know that?

584
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:10,608
Ramon, what's done is done.

585
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,852
You spent all this time bringing
this council together

586
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:14,562
when your time should have been used
helping the team.

587
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:19,196
I wasted your valuable time,
and for that I apologize.

588
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:26,495
What are you... What?

589
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:27,917
Did I spill some soup on me?

590
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:30,086
No, no, no. It's just... That was...

591
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:32,414
That was very real.

592
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:35,508
It's like a very, very genuine apology.

593
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:37,627
Well, I meant it.

594
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:40,380
I can tell. There's no snark,
you're not throwing anything.

595
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:44,100
Right. I'm not. Hmm.

596
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,890
The Council might not have
helped your intelligence,

597
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:52,476
but I think they might have shown you
a little empathy.

598
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:57,856
You know, DA Cecile Horton said
there's other ways to be intelligent.

599
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:00,116
"Open your hearts.

600
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:02,652
- "Open your mind".
- "Open your mind".

601
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:05,113
It's been so long since I've been
concerned for other people's feelings

602
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:06,197
that you know...

603
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:07,915
You know what?

604
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:11,999
Maybe it is time I considered
someone else's feelings.

605
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,880
- Well, I feel...
- DeVoe.

606
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:16,503
- DeVoe.
- Right?

607
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:18,050
Maybe the Council had a point.

608
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:20,796
And the best way for me
to understand DeVoe,

609
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:23,473
put myself in his shoes.

610
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:26,346
- Yeah.
- Is that what you were going to say?

611
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:27,893
No, I was going to say DeVoe.

612
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,141
- Okay.
- That, that makes sense.

613
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:30,347
- It does.
- Yeah.

614
00:27:33,694 --> 00:27:35,686
Hey, anything on Norvok?

615
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:38,146
No, but I do have an update on DeVoe.

616
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:42,067
It's my finished article.

617
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:48,407
Barry, look, I'm just as anxious
as you are about DeVoe,

618
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:52,084
but I really think that we need to
arm the citizens with information,

619
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:53,161
not shield them from it.

620
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:54,959
Iris, I mean, I... I'm just...

621
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:57,381
I'm trying to do what's best
for the city and the team.

622
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:58,753
And look,

623
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:01,507
I think that telling the truth
is what's best.

624
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:03,463
I mean, if we give them
all the facts to consider

625
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:04,764
they will do the right thing.

626
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,136
How can you be sure about that?

627
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:07,342
Look, Barry.

628
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:12,598
I can't deny that you've had
a tough year with DeVoe,

629
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:17,602
but his entire goal is to take
information away from people.

630
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:21,360
If we don't publish this article,
we are no better than he is.

631
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,783
All right. I just... This is...

632
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:25,076
I think it's too risky.

633
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:27,365
I know that's how you feel.

634
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:30,995
And I really want us to be
on the same page.

635
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:33,667
So, it's your decision.

636
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:36,879
- Iris...
- I just want you to remember

637
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,752
that the Flash is a beacon of hope

638
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:41,001
that the people have
always put their faith in.

639
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:45,129
And now it's time for the Flash
to put his faith in the people.

640
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,726
Ah, there you are.

641
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:57,980
I couldn't help but notice
your anger and hostility.

642
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:00,812
Thought your color was blue, not red.

643
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:04,650
Yes, I'm angry. I've been angry
for weeks and still no Killer Frost.

644
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,450
And now, Norvok's ruined everything.

645
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:08,069
Oh, Caity.

646
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:11,869
I hate to see you so torn up like this.

647
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:15,577
So, I'm going to tell you something
that will cheer you up.

648
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:21,712
That splicer did not cure you.

649
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:25,340
- What?
- Well...

650
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,672
You'd come to me so broken,

651
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:30,050
so needy,

652
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:32,681
and so I put that piece of tech
on your head and...

653
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,387
Poof, nothing.

654
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,434
It did not work on you.

655
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:41,106
So you decided to lie to me
rather than tell me that?

656
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,270
Mmm.

657
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:44,985
But just because the splicer
didn't technically work

658
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:46,907
doesn't mean that the results
were not the same.

659
00:29:46,994 --> 00:29:48,735
How? That doesn't make any sense.

660
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,203
You're the doctor, you tell me.

661
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,033
It's a placebo.

662
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:59,045
You see,
it's been inside you the entire time.

663
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:03,375
Caity, your power is unlike anything
I have ever seen before,

664
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:08,213
and no science kit or placebo
is going to explain why you...

665
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:12,133
Hmm.

666
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:14,928
A placebo.

667
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:17,767
A fake.

668
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:19,724
What are you talking about?

669
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:24,275
I know exactly where Norvok is.

670
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:40,753
We were surprised to get the call.

671
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:44,006
Shouldn't be. I'm running things now.

672
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,209
Amunet's gone.

673
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,883
But she did leave behind
something very valuable.

674
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:56,059
Thirty times stronger than steel.

675
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:59,142
You can assemble them
in any shape you like

676
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:00,689
and, best of all,

677
00:31:01,318 --> 00:31:04,902
they're loaded with enough
potential energy to flatten a city.

678
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:11,154
We know where Norvok is.

679
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:13,076
Just when I though I'd considered
every option

680
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:15,280
for where Norvok might be skulking,
I remembered.

681
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:17,536
Whenever the fuzz used to be
on to one of our deals,

682
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:20,494
I would plant a rumor that it was
going down at a false location.

683
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:23,330
A fakeout to keep the "fuzz"
off your tracks.

684
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:24,504
Mmm.

685
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:25,672
So, that's where we think
that Norvok is.

686
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:27,250
In the abandoned Randall sub-station.

687
00:31:27,344 --> 00:31:28,880
Underground. That's why the shards

688
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,336
weren't registering on the satellite.

689
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,887
Why don't the three of us
go get your shards.

690
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:33,464
Then we'll be armed and ready
to take out DeVoe's satellites.

691
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,345
I'm coming, too. I'll get the cold gun.

692
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:36,971
Oh, goody, a group foray.

693
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:38,598
Dibs on cashing in Norvok's chips.

694
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:40,350
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

695
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,727
- No killing.
- That was not a stipulation

696
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:44,104
when I agreed to join this crew.

697
00:31:44,194 --> 00:31:46,686
Okay, Amunet, look.
I... I know how you usually work,

698
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:49,147
but I can handle this fast
and without any casualties.

699
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:52,191
Okay.

700
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:55,361
It is a bit time-consuming to remove
blood from metal.

701
00:32:11,138 --> 00:32:12,345
This deal's off.

702
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:13,797
Those shards belong to Amunet.

703
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:17,258
Well, if that decrepit hag
didn't want them stolen,

704
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:19,344
she shouldn't have told me
where she hid them.

705
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:20,724
Decrepit?

706
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:23,598
That's a big word for such a small man.

707
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:25,103
Amunet, I've got this.

708
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,810
There are some things that a woman
just cannot delegate.

709
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,241
We agreed no killing.

710
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:40,368
That'll make this next part easy.

711
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:04,476
Joe, the shards are in there.
We can't let them get away.

712
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:25,997
Barry, what's going on? Your vitals
are going through the roof.

713
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:27,328
Venom.

714
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:29,004
I think the venom in Amunet's locker.

715
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,126
I'm on it.

716
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:35,761
You are just as vile
as that thing in your head.

717
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:44,182
Took a while to get this made.

718
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:47,056
Now you can't use those things
against me anymore.

719
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:49,851
You always underestimated me.

720
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:56,065
Caitlin, get back. Go, go, go.
Over here.

721
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:12,998
Iris?

722
00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:15,130
Barry, there is no antidote for
meta-human venom that potent.

723
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,633
You're gonna have to phase through it
now before it gets to your heart.

724
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:18,929
Mmm.

725
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:28,813
I'm running out of ammo.

726
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,516
I think they'll hit me
before I hit them with this.

727
00:34:35,115 --> 00:34:36,981
We're looking at this
from the wrong direction.

728
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:38,316
What? What are you doing?

729
00:34:44,124 --> 00:34:45,114
Nice.

730
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:36,090
I've never understood your superpower.

731
00:35:36,176 --> 00:35:39,260
Are you a man with a snake
or a snake with a man?

732
00:35:39,346 --> 00:35:41,212
Amunet, don't kill him.

733
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:42,638
He's more than earned it.

734
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:44,465
It's not about him, it's about you.

735
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,133
Caitlin.

736
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:49,971
Amunet, there is a good part of you.
I truly believe that.

737
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:05,778
But the snake has got to go.

738
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:17,210
Like Norvok, I must be on my way.

739
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,836
Amunet, no. Hey.

740
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:20,919
You leave, there's no way
we can stop DeVoe's satellite.

741
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,755
She was never gonna help us.
She just wanted her metal.

742
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:26,340
Oh, truthfully, I did consider it.

743
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:30,428
I did, but a good player knows
when to fold.

744
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:33,731
And the professor certainly has
a better hand, so...

745
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:36,855
Don't try to stop me.

746
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:39,187
After all, I am packing.

747
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,694
There is nowhere you can go that
DeVoe's satellites won't reach you.

748
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:45,652
If you leave now, you'll be
mind melted just like the rest of us.

749
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:49,322
Good point.

750
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:51,786
Just for the record,
this is not me helping.

751
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,663
It is entirely self-preservation.

752
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:05,426
Filled with shrapnel and bound with
my meta-human <i>je ne sais quoi.</i>

753
00:37:05,515 --> 00:37:07,427
Pull a shard, throw it,

754
00:37:07,517 --> 00:37:10,726
it will deliver
one savage concussive blow.

755
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:12,970
But you only get one shot.

756
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,356
I know you won't waste it.

757
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:18,938
Go save the world, my darling.

758
00:37:41,468 --> 00:37:42,584
And she's gone.

759
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:47,008
At least she didn't
leave us empty-handed.

760
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:56,855
Eye snakes.

761
00:37:57,776 --> 00:37:59,187
Why did it have to be eye snakes?

762
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,940
Trust me, man.
It wasn't as cool as it sounds.

763
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:05,109
Guys, I'm sorry I got so worked up
with Amunet around.

764
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,190
It's okay.

765
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:09,527
Yeah, and Amunet did give us
the alnico metal projectile bomb.

766
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:11,704
I still think it's our best bet
at stopping DeVoe.

767
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,122
We just need to figure out
how to fire it.

768
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:14,699
- Yeah.
- Cisco, can you breach that thing?

769
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:18,161
Me? No way. My energy field
can't even reach outer space.

770
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:20,211
Okay, well we need to find
another solution

771
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,210
and we need to find it before
DeVoe launches those satellites.

772
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,713
Well, actually, thanks to Ramon

773
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:26,965
and the Council of Harrisons,
we may have an idea

774
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:30,173
about why DeVoe has not yet
launched his satellites.

775
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:32,007
He put himself in DeVoe's shoes.

776
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:34,218
Yeah, I thought,
"Well, if I was this ultra genius

777
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,554
"moving around in a floating chair,
how would I feel?"

778
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:38,310
You'd feel nothing.
You'd be sociopathic.

779
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:42,686
Right, but to me,
I wouldn't consider myself sociopathic.

780
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:46,773
Right now all my actions would be
driven by the one thing

781
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:50,155
that I care the most about. Right? And...

782
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:52,282
- So, if you're not acting...
- If I'm not acting,

783
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:55,615
then I don't have the one thing
that I care the most about.

784
00:38:57,085 --> 00:38:58,075
My wife.

785
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:04,961
You guys need me
to walk you through this?

786
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:06,883
No, we... We get it, Harry.

787
00:39:08,388 --> 00:39:10,596
It's kind of complicated but,
okay, I'll take your word.

788
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:12,719
Actually that took a lot out of me.
I'm gonna go have a nap.

789
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,472
Well, we can work with that idea.

790
00:39:16,563 --> 00:39:19,306
Yeah, I will fire up the satellites,
see if I can find Marlize.

791
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:21,391
And I'll start figuring out
how to launch this

792
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:24,485
psychic dark matter-infused
metal shrapnel bomb.

793
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,357
No big deal.

794
00:39:26,823 --> 00:39:28,530
Joe, do you want to get
a cup of coffee with me

795
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:29,902
before you go back to C.C.P.D.?

796
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:32,952
I could use some caffeine after today.

797
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:39,120
I know you don't get tired
of hearing it, but...

798
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:42,286
You were right.

799
00:39:42,589 --> 00:39:45,332
Well, not about Amunet.
She still betrayed us.

800
00:39:45,425 --> 00:39:47,542
But she knew the truth about DeVoe

801
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:50,469
and she ultimately made
a selfless decision to help us

802
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:52,342
by giving us the projectile.

803
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:56,596
And I do have faith
in Central City, Iris.

804
00:39:57,353 --> 00:40:01,438
Because I know that at the core
of every citizen in this city

805
00:40:02,692 --> 00:40:03,682
is something good.

806
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:09,063
And I know they'll feel the same way
when they read your article.

807
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:12,650
Let's tell the team.

808
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:16,995
Are you sure you wanna do this? You...

809
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:19,698
You want me to publish my article?

810
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:20,782
Without a doubt.

811
00:40:22,045 --> 00:40:26,289
We're always stronger, better together.

812
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:29,462
Kiss me.

813
00:40:34,724 --> 00:40:35,714
Thank you.

814
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:43,097
Uh-uh. This one's on me. I insist.

815
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:45,023
Nice. What did I do to deserve that?

816
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:47,143
That's for giving me the advice I needed

817
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:48,647
even when I didn't want to hear it.

818
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:51,230
Well, when you raise kids,
you get used to giving advice.

819
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:53,357
So...

820
00:40:54,661 --> 00:40:57,278
I was convinced that
that splicer technology

821
00:40:57,372 --> 00:40:58,863
was the key
to getting Killer Frost back.

822
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:00,664
But I was wrong.

823
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,457
The splicer was just a placebo,

824
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:05,707
and it tricked me into manifesting
those somatic results that I wanted.

825
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:07,038
You learned that from Amunet?

826
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:08,997
Mmm-hmm. I thought the answer
was in science,

827
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:10,674
but it was never gonna be there.

828
00:41:11,511 --> 00:41:12,501
So what now?

829
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:13,676
I'm gonna take your advice.

830
00:41:13,763 --> 00:41:15,971
I'm gonna look in
a completely different direction.

831
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:19,307
The key to finding Killer Frost
is not out there.

832
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:20,717
It's in here.

833
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,981
Iris, what's happening?

834
00:41:34,075 --> 00:41:36,362
- Barry, it's the city.
- What?

835
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:38,159
I posted my article
and they're responding.

836
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:40,492
What do you mean? They believed you?

837
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,447
More than that. They wanna help. Look.

838
00:41:46,379 --> 00:41:49,167
This guy says that he saw DeVoe
at Fifth and Knoll two days ago.

839
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:51,044
Yeah, and another guy
on Crescent and Tenth.

840
00:41:51,134 --> 00:41:52,341
This is great.

841
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:55,753
Iris,

842
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:57,839
this means DeVoe can't
hide from us anymore.

843
00:41:57,863 --> 00:42:05,863
