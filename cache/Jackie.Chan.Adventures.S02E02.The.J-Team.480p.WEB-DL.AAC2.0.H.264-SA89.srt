1
00:00:05,372 --> 00:00:07,306
Jackie, robbery
in progress.

2
00:00:07,308 --> 00:00:08,807
It's the dark hand.

3
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:11,910
They're packing heat.
Talisman heat.

4
00:00:11,912 --> 00:00:14,480
Our spell will
keep you bound

5
00:00:14,482 --> 00:00:16,515
within the human
of your choosing.

6
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:19,251
Until
you release us.

7
00:00:19,253 --> 00:00:22,021
Shendu: And the human
most capable for this task...

8
00:00:22,023 --> 00:00:23,655
Jackie chan.

9
00:00:23,657 --> 00:00:26,291
Yi-ahh!

10
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:30,396
Finn: Uh, big v?
Shendu's back.

11
00:00:30,398 --> 00:00:32,264
Destroy them!

12
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:33,599
Jackie: But I don't
understand.

13
00:00:33,601 --> 00:00:36,235
Valmont can't summon
the shadowkhan.

14
00:00:36,237 --> 00:00:37,870
Only shendu.

15
00:00:37,872 --> 00:00:39,605
Reports of my demise

16
00:00:39,607 --> 00:00:43,242
have been
greatly exaggerated, chan.

17
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:51,350
I'll take the guy
in the ninja suit.

18
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:57,423
Better idea.

19
00:00:57,425 --> 00:00:59,691
Yaah!

20
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:07,332
Ohh!

21
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:10,869
Ohh!
Unh!

22
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:20,572
(Uncle chanting
magic spell)

23
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:29,681
Whew!

24
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:31,350
Whoa.

25
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,421
Unc, that was
some magic.

26
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:38,490
Heh! Simple
chi spell.

27
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,125
Many others
in my book.

28
00:02:40,127 --> 00:02:42,227
So the big bad
dragon <i> is</i> back,

29
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:44,062
and he's packing
the talismans?

30
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:46,732
Talismans
are not important!

31
00:02:46,734 --> 00:02:49,668
Shendu is a spirit now.

32
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:53,539
Not even the talismans
can change that.

33
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:55,841
So you figure
he's onto something

34
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:58,143
bigger, <i> mi compadre?</i>

35
00:02:58,145 --> 00:03:01,380
The book shendu stole
from my library

36
00:03:01,382 --> 00:03:04,516
is a key to understanding
his motives.

37
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:07,452
But which volume
did he steal?

38
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:09,288
How do I know?!

39
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,757
We must take inventory!

40
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:14,459
So all these books
have spells--ow!

41
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:16,161
Do not touch!

42
00:03:16,163 --> 00:03:17,829
Aww.

43
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:20,866
This is bigger
than valmont, sir.

44
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:24,136
The dragon is back
from the grave.

45
00:03:24,138 --> 00:03:26,171
Correct, the one
with the magic talismans.

46
00:03:26,173 --> 00:03:28,473
I didn't believe it either,
sir, until I--

47
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:32,411
uh, yes, I feel fine.

48
00:03:32,413 --> 00:03:35,380
Jackie, we can't move!
The bad guys are--

49
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:38,317
too powerful for
one archaeologist
to stop, Jade.

50
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,552
They'll still need you
to consult, right?

51
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:43,522
Jackie, I just spoke
with my superiors
in Washington.

52
00:03:43,524 --> 00:03:45,123
Are they sending
reinforcements?

53
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:48,393
They're...Reassigning
all dark hand matters

54
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:49,528
to section 12.

55
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:52,631
I never should've
used the "m" word.

56
00:03:52,633 --> 00:03:54,600
But there's
no time to lose.

57
00:03:54,602 --> 00:03:58,537
The mainframe indicates
that valmont has
just left the country.

58
00:03:58,539 --> 00:03:59,671
But how will you--

59
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:01,540
my hands may be tied,
Jackie,

60
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:03,875
but yours aren't.

61
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:05,811
But I have to go,
Jade.

62
00:04:05,813 --> 00:04:08,313
Jackie, you can't face
shendu alone.

63
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:09,815
You need back-up.

64
00:04:09,817 --> 00:04:12,217
That's why I'm going
to get uncle.

65
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:13,885
Uncle's just the brains.

66
00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:16,455
You need muscle
on your team.

67
00:04:16,457 --> 00:04:17,923
Hmph!

68
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:20,692
And I know just where
to find you some.

69
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:23,528
(Telephone rings)

70
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,597
<i>Buenos dias.</i>

71
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:26,732
El toro fuerte!

72
00:04:26,734 --> 00:04:27,833
El toro: <i> Si?</i>

73
00:04:27,835 --> 00:04:29,668
It is for you.

74
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,245
Jade?

75
00:04:40,247 --> 00:04:43,015
Well, what do you know?

76
00:04:43,017 --> 00:04:45,617
Uncle: We cannot
leave until we know

77
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,452
what shendu
is planning,

78
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:48,654
and we cannot know that

79
00:04:48,656 --> 00:04:50,956
until we know
which book he took.

80
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,424
(Door bells jingle)

81
00:04:52,426 --> 00:04:53,859
Go away!

82
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:56,662
We are closed
for inventory.

83
00:04:56,664 --> 00:05:00,032
We are not
customers.

84
00:05:00,034 --> 00:05:04,169
Jackie! A burglar!

85
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:05,570
Wha--oh!

86
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:07,639
Uncle,
he is no thief!

87
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:08,940
He is--ow!

88
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:12,044
Of course he is a thief!
He is wearing a mask!

89
00:05:12,046 --> 00:05:13,445
Oh, no, no, no!

90
00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:16,014
El toro fuerte
<i>never</i> removes his mask.

91
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:19,117
You!

92
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:20,719
Dark hand enemy!

93
00:05:20,721 --> 00:05:22,788
Aah!

94
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:27,392
Jackie!

95
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,098
Ahh! Ohh! Oop!

96
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:39,771
Aah!

97
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:45,077
Whaa!

98
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:49,247
Ohh! Thank you--bwha!

99
00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:51,883
I've heard of a bull
in a China shop,
Jackie...

100
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:54,619
But two?

101
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:56,421
Viper?!

102
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:58,623
No thieves allowed
in uncle's--ow!

103
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,192
How can she
be the thief?

104
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:03,395
She is not wearing a mask
and wrecking my store.

105
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,630
Both: Aah!

106
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:08,367
Stop! Tohru is--aah!

107
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,538
On our side now.

108
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,340
Chan tells the truth.

109
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:17,709
Sorry.

110
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,911
Ohh.

111
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:23,415
All right! Viper,
El toro, you made it.

112
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:25,851
Who invited you?

113
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:27,652
I am
El toro's protege.

114
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:29,688
Wherever he goes,
I go.

115
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:32,357
Ok, paco. But try
not to get in the way

116
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:33,558
while Jackie's
kicking butt.

117
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,460
But it is
El toro fuerte

118
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:36,962
who will be kicking
the butt, Jade.

119
00:06:36,964 --> 00:06:38,063
Jackie.
El toro.

120
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:39,264
Jackie!
El toro!

121
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:40,365
Jackie!
El toro!

122
00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:42,067
Jade, explain.

123
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:44,069
It's your team! Duh!

124
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:46,204
The j-team!
The chan clan!

125
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:47,672
The chan-tastic five!

126
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:49,274
Chan-tastic?

127
00:06:49,276 --> 00:06:52,978
5! See,
- you and me make 2...

128
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,647
And then there's viper...

129
00:06:57,316 --> 00:06:59,985
And El toro makes 4...

130
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:06,491
And I, paco,
am the fifth member
of the j-team!

131
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:09,961
I actually had someone
less...Puny in mind.

132
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,600
I am honored.

133
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:18,103
I am sorry you all
came here for nothing,

134
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:19,504
but I didn't realize

135
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:22,174
my niece read
so many comic books.

136
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,944
I cannot accept
your help.

137
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:28,613
Never pegged you
as the macho type,
Jackie.

138
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:32,584
I especially
cannot accept help
from a super-thief.

139
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:34,119
Ex-super-thief.

140
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:36,288
Went legit
after the pink puma
fiasco.

141
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,156
Uncle: Hotcha!

142
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:42,060
The missing book!

143
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:43,228
Which one is it?

144
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,330
A guide
to ancient artifacts

145
00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:48,533
located in Tibet.

146
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:51,369
Ancient <i> magic</i>
àartifacts, I bet.

147
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:57,342
Ahh!

148
00:07:57,344 --> 00:08:00,879
The pan ku box.

149
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:08,253
Soon my demon brethren
shall be free

150
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:11,957
and their new reign
of terror will begin.

151
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,697
Jackie:
Captain black managed
to pull some strings.

152
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:20,866
He has a jet waiting.

153
00:08:20,868 --> 00:08:22,167
Ok, team,
let's move out!

154
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:25,070
Jade, there is no team.

155
00:08:25,072 --> 00:08:28,507
Oh?
- These j-team jackets
say you're wrong.

156
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:30,275
Ack! Ugh!

157
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:35,647
Tohru, tend the shop
and watch Jade.

158
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:37,415
The rest of you...

159
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:39,951
Get out!

160
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,856
Valmont's voice:
It's my body, and I say
we're going home!

161
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:47,359
Shendu's voice:
You dare defy me?!

162
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:48,927
My hair!

163
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:52,364
You will suffer
for--aah!

164
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:54,799
Get out of my head!

165
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:56,635
Aah!
Hss!

166
00:08:56,637 --> 00:08:58,236
You mortal---

167
00:08:58,238 --> 00:09:00,572
so, uh, who
we rooting for?

168
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,743
Tohru: Uh, I don't know
about this, Jade.

169
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:07,145
Uncle's instructions
were very clear.

170
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:09,114
Uh-huh. He said
to tend to the shop

171
00:09:09,116 --> 00:09:11,182
<i>and</i> watch me.
Since I'm skipping
town,

172
00:09:11,184 --> 00:09:12,317
you can't do both.

173
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:14,352
And seor uncle
told all of us

174
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:16,788
to get out of his shop,
so we did.

175
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:26,865
(Sighs) We must stop
for the night.

176
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:30,435
But what about
shendu? We need
to hurry--ow!

177
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:32,170
You want uncle to help

178
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:35,473
defeat the ultimate evil,
yes?

179
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:37,542
Then uncle needs his rest!

180
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:48,453
(Gargling)

181
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:52,223
(Yawn) Lucky for us
valmont got
all worn out

182
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:53,592
slapping himself
silly.

183
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:55,660
Yeah, I'm bushed.

184
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:02,300
Ratso:
Good night, Finn.

185
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:03,735
Night, ratso.

186
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,838
Good night,
talismans.

187
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,443
(Ratso snoring)

188
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:34,799
What are you
doing here?

189
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,334
What's it look like?

190
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:37,936
Thank you. Now go away.

191
00:10:37,938 --> 00:10:39,337
Go away yourself.

192
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:40,872
I'm the super-thief,
remember?

193
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:42,040
Ex-super-thief.

194
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:43,541
Just give me!
No!

195
00:10:43,543 --> 00:10:45,543
Let me have--
don't!

196
00:10:45,545 --> 00:10:47,112
No!

197
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,881
Slumbering Bear
greets the Dawn!

198
00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:51,216
Way to go.

199
00:10:51,218 --> 00:10:52,484
Hungry wolf
slaughters lamb!

200
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:57,922
(Whistles)

201
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:00,492
Tohru, buddy!

202
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:01,726
You're alive.

203
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:03,995
Good to see you.

204
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:08,366
Tohru's a traitor!

205
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:10,902
Then give him
a taste
of talisman.

206
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:15,206
Our powers!
My pants!

207
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:23,181
<i>Buenos noches,</i>
à <i> muchachos!</i>

208
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:25,283
(Snoring)

209
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,458
They have
the talismans!

210
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,526
Sorry.

211
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:47,706
I trust you all
had plenty of rest.

212
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,574
Now follow me!

213
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,178
Jackie!
El toro!

214
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:56,681
No yelling! Uncle cannot
sleep with--ohh!

215
00:11:56,683 --> 00:11:58,717
Tohru?

216
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:02,120
If you are here,
who is tending
my shop?

217
00:12:02,122 --> 00:12:03,621
Uh...

218
00:12:03,623 --> 00:12:06,224
Don't worry, uncle,
it's covered.

219
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:11,896
Chi spells. Hmm.

220
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,631
Look what you did!

221
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:15,734
Hey, it's
not my fault you're
not a team player.

222
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:17,602
We only wished
to help.

223
00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:19,437
And without us
you would've
been pulverized.

224
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:20,939
I was pulverized!

225
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:23,742
And the dark hand
still has
all the talismans!

226
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:26,745
I told you!
Talismans are
not important!

227
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:28,613
Of course
talismans
are important.

228
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:30,982
Talismans are
not important!

229
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:32,517
Talismans are
<i>very</i> important!

230
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:34,552
Not important!
Very important!

231
00:12:34,554 --> 00:12:36,855
Jackie: It's your fault
we lost the talismans!

232
00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:38,156
No, it's your fault!

233
00:12:38,158 --> 00:12:40,325
The grown-ups
are staring to
sound like us.

234
00:12:40,327 --> 00:12:42,060
And we don't have
time for kid stuff.

235
00:12:42,062 --> 00:12:44,896
Come on. We gotta
follow shendu.

236
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:52,537
We will
take them down?

237
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:54,706
Uh-uh. They're
packing talismans.

238
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,941
But we're wily.

239
00:12:56,943 --> 00:13:00,145
(All arguing)

240
00:13:00,147 --> 00:13:01,946
I don't know why
I'm listening
to you.

241
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:03,581
I'm doing
this for Jade.

242
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:04,649
Jade?

243
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,417
Paco?

244
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:09,921
Both: Where are
the children?!

245
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:20,565
Ahh! The pan ku box!

246
00:13:20,567 --> 00:13:22,400
Quickly! Take it!

247
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:25,270
Uh, why don't
you take it?

248
00:13:25,272 --> 00:13:26,905
I cannot touch it.

249
00:13:26,907 --> 00:13:29,207
It is forged
of good magic.

250
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:32,811
And I, most decidedly,
am not.

251
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:34,612
Well, if nobody
wants it,

252
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:36,447
pan ku very much!

253
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:48,860
Exterminate the pests
permanently!

254
00:13:48,862 --> 00:13:50,461
Ohh!
Ohh!

255
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:58,002
Don't worry.
Jackie will rescue us.

256
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:00,638
No, El toro
will rescue us.

257
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,840
Jackie.
El toro.

258
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:03,041
Jackie!
El toro!

259
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:04,108
Jackie!
El toro!

260
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,243
Jackie!
El toro!

261
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:06,811
Ohh! Look!

262
00:14:06,813 --> 00:14:08,646
Jade & paco:
The j-team!

263
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:10,615
Let them go.

264
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:14,385
Ooh, you're gonna
get it now.

265
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,192
Yeaah!

266
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:23,428
Aah! Good magic!

267
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:32,704
Come on!

268
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,875
Wait here.

269
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:55,493
Grr!

270
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:01,466
Flying dragon corkscrew!

271
00:15:01,468 --> 00:15:03,134
Horse tail swatting flies!

272
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:14,045
Ohh!

273
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:17,248
Inscriptions.

274
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,484
Invisibility
<i>and</i> speed!

275
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:21,953
I'll kick your butt
in fast-forward.

276
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,925
Gotta work
on the brakes.

277
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,267
Hey, Finn, can I bum
a talisman?

278
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,770
Kind of busy here--
hey, hey, hey!

279
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:43,841
Heat beams! Sweet!

280
00:15:43,843 --> 00:15:45,543
Hey, my glasses!

281
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:46,878
Mad monkey kung fu!

282
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,379
Octopus fits of fury!

283
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:49,714
Shredding lion claws!

284
00:15:49,716 --> 00:15:51,182
Minnows wallops whale!

285
00:15:51,184 --> 00:15:53,318
I'm sorry, what was
the last part?

286
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,553
I said minnow--aah!

287
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,290
"What was that last part?"

288
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,760
I wasn't going
to use these,

289
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:06,264
but now you've
made me mad!

290
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:08,933
Astral projection? Gaah!

291
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:15,606
Ow!

292
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:20,311
Aah!

293
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,480
Jackie, we gotta
get the--

294
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,082
talk later, Jade!

295
00:16:24,084 --> 00:16:25,616
Rrr!

296
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:28,653
Hey!

297
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:44,502
I'm going out
on a limb here,

298
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,671
but it looks like
you need contacts.

299
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:47,739
Maybe--aah!

300
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,075
You won't be needing
this

301
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:59,317
aah! Oh! Oh! Ahh!

302
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:01,619
Oh! Oh! Aah!

303
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,024
Oh, Jackie!

304
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,426
Ohh!

305
00:17:08,428 --> 00:17:09,727
Come on!

306
00:17:09,729 --> 00:17:12,130
Give me somebody!

307
00:17:12,132 --> 00:17:15,199
Who's strong like ox
now, eh, El toro?

308
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:17,702
Now you, skinny.

309
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:20,071
Unh! Ohh!

310
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:24,175
Yin-Yang! The power
of balance!

311
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:27,678
You will be unable
to knock me--oof!

312
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:31,249
Spiritual balance,
hak <i> fool.</i>

313
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:32,617
Unh--oof!

314
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:34,519
You are blocking
my light!

315
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:37,588
(All moaning)

316
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:42,527
Looking for these?

317
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:45,396
Run!

318
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:48,099
We have
all 12 talismans!

319
00:17:48,101 --> 00:17:52,837
Talismans are
not important!

320
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:58,776
The inscriptions are.

321
00:17:58,778 --> 00:18:01,712
Shendu was one
of 8 demon sorcerers

322
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:04,148
who terrorized
the ancient world,

323
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:06,417
each with his
or her own magic

324
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:09,487
derived from fire...

325
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:11,689
Sky...

326
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:13,791
Moon...

327
00:18:13,793 --> 00:18:15,593
Thunder...

328
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:17,829
Earth...

329
00:18:17,831 --> 00:18:20,398
Mountain...

330
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,568
Wind...

331
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,636
And water.

332
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:29,207
One by one,
- the demons were defeated

333
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:31,542
by the 8 immortals,

334
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:34,912
the legendary heroes
of ancient China.

335
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:42,353
The immortals used
powerful chi spells

336
00:18:42,355 --> 00:18:45,723
to banish the demons
to another realm...

337
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:52,163
Then used the pan ku box
to seal them in...

338
00:18:52,165 --> 00:18:55,600
Each demon
behind its own portal.

339
00:18:55,602 --> 00:18:58,202
The only thing
which could locate

340
00:18:58,204 --> 00:19:00,538
and unlock those portals

341
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:03,274
is the pan ku box itself.

342
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,911
So...

343
00:19:06,913 --> 00:19:09,547
It is
- a very good thing

344
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:11,149
that shendu did not--

345
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:13,050
shendu's gone
and he took
the pan ku box!

346
00:19:13,052 --> 00:19:15,786
Ayah!

347
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:17,221
We must get it back

348
00:19:17,223 --> 00:19:18,990
before shendu
finds the doors

349
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:22,226
and releases
the 7 other demons!

350
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,900
Jackie: I had captain black
pull more strings

351
00:19:28,902 --> 00:19:30,902
to provide a ride home
for everyone.

352
00:19:30,904 --> 00:19:33,104
Consider it my way
of saying thank you

353
00:19:33,106 --> 00:19:34,438
for all your help.

354
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,907
Weren't you
listening to uncle?

355
00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:37,275
The job's
not finish--

356
00:19:37,277 --> 00:19:39,043
shh!

357
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:40,811
But Jade
is right.

358
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:43,281
Seor shendu
will release
the demons.

359
00:19:43,283 --> 00:19:46,117
We cannot accept help
from a thief.

360
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:48,219
I am the wrestler,
she is the thief.

361
00:19:48,221 --> 00:19:49,453
Ex-thief.

362
00:19:49,455 --> 00:19:50,655
Don't worry,
handsome.

363
00:19:50,657 --> 00:19:52,523
Next time Jackie's
in a pinch,

364
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,292
Jade knows
who to call.

365
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,828
Well, Jade,
El toro may be
the best...

366
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,630
And Jackie
may be better...

367
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:02,300
Both: But the j-team
is the greatest!

368
00:20:02,302 --> 00:20:06,304
Jackie! I must get
back to my shop!

369
00:20:06,306 --> 00:20:07,838
Uncle,
I told you,

370
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,574
your shop's
in good hands.

371
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:15,046
(Chanting magic spell)

372
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,418
(Ribbit)

373
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:24,355
- Man: Hey, Jackie?
- Yes?

374
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:25,790
Do you watch
your cartoon series?

375
00:20:25,792 --> 00:20:28,693
Of course, of course,
definitely, yes.

376
00:20:28,695 --> 00:20:32,964
I have to watch
every episode.

377
00:20:32,966 --> 00:20:34,565
It's just like my movies.

378
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:35,733
I want to make a movie,

379
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:37,401
everybody understand
what I'm doing,

380
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:38,603
what I'm saying.

381
00:20:38,605 --> 00:20:41,172
I want so make sure
the cartoon is me,

382
00:20:41,174 --> 00:20:43,741
and also the cartoon
is good for the kids.

383
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:46,077
Nothing wrong, just always
the good things.

384
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,645
Yes.
