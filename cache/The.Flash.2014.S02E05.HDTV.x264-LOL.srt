1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:01,934
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:01,936 --> 00:00:04,703
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:04,705 --> 00:00:07,740
To the outside world, I'm
an ordinary forensic scientist,

4
00:00:07,742 --> 00:00:10,776
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

5
00:00:11,825 --> 00:00:15,427
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

6
00:00:15,429 --> 00:00:17,328
I hunted down the man who killed my mother,

7
00:00:17,469 --> 00:00:20,821
but in doing so, I opened up
our world to new threats,

8
00:00:20,823 --> 00:00:24,191
and I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

9
00:00:24,193 --> 00:00:26,326
I am The Flash!

10
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:29,246
<i>Previously on "The Flash"...</i>

11
00:00:29,248 --> 00:00:31,532
I get a vision of something
that's already happened,

12
00:00:31,534 --> 00:00:33,000
and then it's gone.

13
00:00:33,002 --> 00:00:34,501
I don't want anyone to know about this.

14
00:00:34,503 --> 00:00:36,036
When you created the Singularity

15
00:00:36,038 --> 00:00:38,822
above Central City, you
also created a breach

16
00:00:38,824 --> 00:00:41,458
between my world and yours,
connecting our two earths.

17
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,178
52 breaches in Central City
and the biggest one

18
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:45,996
just happens to be in our basement.

19
00:00:45,998 --> 00:00:47,881
The person who broke
into my facility last night

20
00:00:47,883 --> 00:00:50,500
was Harrison Wells.

21
00:00:50,502 --> 00:00:52,853
Hey, put him down!

22
00:00:55,173 --> 00:00:57,357
Who the hell are you?

23
00:01:01,029 --> 00:01:02,729
Hello.

24
00:01:02,731 --> 00:01:04,481
For those of you who don't know me,

25
00:01:04,483 --> 00:01:06,533
my name is Harrison Wells.

26
00:01:06,535 --> 00:01:08,368
We know you.

27
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:12,289
Today, the future has arrived.

28
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:15,292
Our city has seen incredible...

29
00:01:15,294 --> 00:01:19,029
meta-humans... men and women...

30
00:01:19,031 --> 00:01:20,831
with extraordinary abilities:

31
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:23,133
the ability to soar above buildings,

32
00:01:23,135 --> 00:01:27,037
to run faster than the speed of light.

33
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:29,473
Unfortunately, most of these meta-humans

34
00:01:29,475 --> 00:01:32,893
have chosen the wrong path
with these powers, a dark path.

35
00:01:32,895 --> 00:01:35,979
My team and I at S.T.A.R. Labs are committed

36
00:01:35,981 --> 00:01:38,816
to keeping up with these perilous times,

37
00:01:38,818 --> 00:01:41,051
and so may I present to you our new line

38
00:01:41,053 --> 00:01:42,886
of meta-human awareness apps?

39
00:01:49,077 --> 00:01:54,498
This technology will allow you
to instantly detect

40
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,200
the presence of a meta-human.

41
00:01:56,202 --> 00:01:58,368
You'll be instantly alerted
to an approaching speedster,

42
00:01:58,370 --> 00:01:59,670
like Zoom or like...

43
00:02:06,178 --> 00:02:07,711
Flash.

44
00:02:13,101 --> 00:02:14,351
Welcome, Flash.

45
00:02:14,353 --> 00:02:16,186
Tell them the truth, Dr. Wells.

46
00:02:16,188 --> 00:02:18,472
Everything that has happened
to this city the past two years

47
00:02:18,474 --> 00:02:19,890
is because of you.

48
00:02:19,892 --> 00:02:21,525
You created all of us metas.

49
00:02:21,527 --> 00:02:23,894
You created Zoom.

50
00:02:23,896 --> 00:02:25,362
I created Zoom?

51
00:02:25,364 --> 00:02:27,197
11 hours before the first meta sighting,

52
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:29,316
enormous blasts of dark matter radiation

53
00:02:29,318 --> 00:02:31,318
were silently expelled beneath this lab.

54
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,770
I'm sorry, Flash,
I believe all this fast running

55
00:02:33,772 --> 00:02:35,205
may have scrambled your brain.

56
00:02:35,207 --> 00:02:37,658
You take no responsibility for the wreckage

57
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,243
your mistakes have caused.

58
00:02:39,245 --> 00:02:42,079
Admit it, Wells, and then
maybe you can truly

59
00:02:42,081 --> 00:02:44,281
help me do something about it.

60
00:02:44,283 --> 00:02:46,116
Help you, because I'm
the greatest tech entrepreneur

61
00:02:46,118 --> 00:02:47,467
of all time?

62
00:02:47,469 --> 00:02:49,253
You're the superhero,

63
00:02:49,255 --> 00:02:51,171
and we would all be safe

64
00:02:51,173 --> 00:02:54,925
if you would just do your job and stop Zoom.

65
00:03:01,633 --> 00:03:05,635
Well, I guess it's safe to say
the speedster sensors work.

66
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:10,140
- You okay, Dad?
- I'm fine, sweetie.

67
00:03:10,142 --> 00:03:11,992
Now where was I?

68
00:03:11,994 --> 00:03:15,829
Oh, that's right, the future.

00:03:25,324 --> 00:03:27,841
Very strange to be holding
your autobiography,

71
00:03:27,843 --> 00:03:29,793
especially when you didn't write it

72
00:03:29,795 --> 00:03:31,428
and it's not about you.

73
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:36,883
Dr. Caitlin Snow, Cisco Ramon,
meet Dr. Harrison Wells

74
00:03:36,885 --> 00:03:38,602
from Earth-2.

75
00:03:38,604 --> 00:03:41,805
- Hi.
- Hi.

76
00:03:41,807 --> 00:03:44,808
So let me get this straight.

77
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:48,612
You're the doppelganger
of the man who murdered his mom

78
00:03:48,614 --> 00:03:51,031
and is responsible for both Ronnie

79
00:03:51,033 --> 00:03:52,515
and Eddie's deaths?

80
00:03:52,517 --> 00:03:53,683
Yeah, but he's not even the doppelganger

81
00:03:53,685 --> 00:03:55,452
of the Dr. Wells that we knew

82
00:03:55,454 --> 00:03:56,987
because that Dr. Wells' body
had been taken over

83
00:03:56,989 --> 00:03:59,373
by the Reverse Flash,
who was really Eobard Thawne

84
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:04,077
and Eddie's distant
relative from the future.

85
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:06,079
Yeah, I didn't follow
any of that. I'm my own man.

86
00:04:06,081 --> 00:04:07,364
I had nothing to do with the murder

87
00:04:07,366 --> 00:04:08,698
of your mother or your friend Ricky.

88
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,550
- His name was Ronnie.
- Him either.

89
00:04:10,552 --> 00:04:13,136
You told me you have proof of your identity?

90
00:04:13,138 --> 00:04:16,423
This almost hit me
when I went through the portal.

91
00:04:16,425 --> 00:04:18,375
Your stabilized breach
downstairs connects directly

92
00:04:18,377 --> 00:04:20,394
to the S.T.A.R. Labs on my Earth.

93
00:04:20,396 --> 00:04:21,762
Technically, this could be mine,

94
00:04:21,764 --> 00:04:23,897
but I want to run some tests on you.

95
00:04:23,899 --> 00:04:25,349
I'll be genetically indistinguishable

96
00:04:25,351 --> 00:04:26,483
from my Earth-1 counterpart.

97
00:04:26,485 --> 00:04:27,901
Your tests will reveal nothing.

98
00:04:27,903 --> 00:04:29,152
Great! Still gonna run 'em.

99
00:04:29,154 --> 00:04:30,404
Be my guest.

100
00:04:30,406 --> 00:04:32,105
Why are we even listening to him?

101
00:04:32,107 --> 00:04:33,890
How do we know he's not evil
like the other guy?

102
00:04:33,892 --> 00:04:35,409
He saved my life last night.

103
00:04:35,411 --> 00:04:37,194
The question is why.

104
00:04:37,196 --> 00:04:38,895
I'm guessing you didn't
travel between dimensions

105
00:04:38,897 --> 00:04:40,113
just to meet The Flash.

106
00:04:40,115 --> 00:04:41,782
That's exactly what I did.

107
00:04:41,784 --> 00:04:44,868
I came here to help you, Barry,
to stop your greatest enemy.

108
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,236
He already did that.

109
00:04:46,238 --> 00:04:47,871
I'm not talking about Reverse Flash.

110
00:04:47,873 --> 00:04:50,374
I'm talking about Zoom.

111
00:04:50,376 --> 00:04:51,758
I see you've already heard of him.

112
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,261
Yeah, Zoom has been sending meta-humans

113
00:04:54,263 --> 00:04:56,847
from your world through
the breaches to fight me.

114
00:04:56,849 --> 00:04:59,299
Well, they're the symptoms.

115
00:04:59,301 --> 00:05:01,034
Zoom's the plague,

116
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,654
one that's infected my world,
and now he's coming for yours.

117
00:05:03,656 --> 00:05:07,024
- What do you know about Zoom?
- Everything.

118
00:05:07,026 --> 00:05:10,328
I created Zoom.

119
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:12,880
I'm responsible for all
the Earth-2 meta-humans,

120
00:05:12,882 --> 00:05:14,332
a fact I've ignored for far too long,

121
00:05:14,334 --> 00:05:18,336
but now I'm doing something about it.

122
00:05:18,338 --> 00:05:20,554
Yeah, well, we're batting a thousand

123
00:05:20,556 --> 00:05:22,506
against these breachers.

124
00:05:22,508 --> 00:05:24,708
You're batting a thousand, Crisco?

125
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,377
What's your sample size?

126
00:05:26,379 --> 00:05:29,096
Ten? Less?

127
00:05:29,098 --> 00:05:32,316
Zoom is obsessed with speed.

128
00:05:32,318 --> 00:05:34,652
He will never allow there
to be another speedster

129
00:05:34,654 --> 00:05:36,237
in the multiverse,
and he's gonna keep sending

130
00:05:36,239 --> 00:05:38,939
these metas here, one after the next,

131
00:05:38,941 --> 00:05:40,408
all with the same goal:

132
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:43,327
to kill The Flash
unless we stop him together.

133
00:05:43,329 --> 00:05:45,863
Last time we listened
to a guy with your face,

134
00:05:45,865 --> 00:05:47,915
some bad things went down.

135
00:05:47,917 --> 00:05:50,951
We lost people we cared about.

136
00:05:50,953 --> 00:05:53,570
Everyone loses someone
they care about, Snow.

137
00:05:53,572 --> 00:05:57,792
The real test of character is
what you do once they're gone.

138
00:06:14,644 --> 00:06:16,593
Joe! Put the gun down!

139
00:06:16,595 --> 00:06:18,979
How is he still alive?
How are you still alive?

140
00:06:18,981 --> 00:06:21,065
I don't know, because you missed?

141
00:06:21,067 --> 00:06:22,766
Hey, I'm trying to keep him
from shooting you.

142
00:06:22,768 --> 00:06:25,152
You're not helping.
Let's take a walk, all right?

143
00:06:25,154 --> 00:06:27,438
It's all good.

144
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,440
We know someone who can verify everything

145
00:06:29,442 --> 00:06:31,826
that this guy just said.

146
00:06:31,828 --> 00:06:34,245
Be careful.

147
00:06:34,247 --> 00:06:35,546
I don't suppose you have a Big Belly Burger

148
00:06:35,548 --> 00:06:37,415
in this universe, do you?

149
00:06:37,417 --> 00:06:38,799
This isn't happening.

150
00:06:38,801 --> 00:06:41,218
I know that this is a lot to take in,

151
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,454
but that guy back in that
room, that's not Wells.

152
00:06:43,456 --> 00:06:46,891
Dr. McGee swore she saw Wells.
He broke into Mercury Labs.

153
00:06:46,893 --> 00:06:48,759
What? Why didn't you tell me this?

154
00:06:48,761 --> 00:06:50,294
Because I didn't believe her.

155
00:06:50,296 --> 00:06:51,628
I didn't even want
to consider Wells was alive.

156
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:54,298
Eddie erased that Wells from existence.

157
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,735
This guy is... he's someone else,

158
00:06:57,737 --> 00:07:00,071
and he says he's here to help us stop Zoom.

159
00:07:00,073 --> 00:07:01,188
How can you even look at him?

160
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,973
You think this is easy for me?

161
00:07:02,975 --> 00:07:06,277
The guy in there looks, moves,
sounds exactly like the guy

162
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:07,862
that drove a knife
through my mother's heart.

163
00:07:07,864 --> 00:07:10,247
I have to resist the urge to kill him.

164
00:07:10,249 --> 00:07:12,700
I'm trying my best to get past that, okay?

165
00:07:12,702 --> 00:07:15,119
You shooting him... that's not helping.

166
00:07:15,121 --> 00:07:17,321
After all our losses, I thought at least

167
00:07:17,323 --> 00:07:19,323
we were free of Wells.

168
00:07:19,325 --> 00:07:22,009
I just want one week
where we're not surprised

169
00:07:22,011 --> 00:07:23,761
by somebody from our past.

170
00:07:23,763 --> 00:07:26,597
I better go fill in Iris.

171
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:28,499
Good luck.

172
00:07:33,054 --> 00:07:34,638
I hope you're happy, Linda.

173
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,223
Tanner's lawyers are threatening to sue us.

174
00:07:36,225 --> 00:07:37,674
I'm sorry, Chief.

175
00:07:37,676 --> 00:07:39,477
I don't care how many
touchdowns Tanner throws.

176
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:42,813
I'm not interviewing some
roided out jerk who hit his wife

177
00:07:42,815 --> 00:07:43,847
unless it's to hold him accountable

178
00:07:43,849 --> 00:07:46,283
for domestic violence.

179
00:07:46,285 --> 00:07:48,068
All right, run your story, Park.

180
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:51,238
The sports page used to be
a lot less complicated.

181
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,124
She shoots.

182
00:07:53,126 --> 00:07:57,411
She scores.

183
00:07:57,413 --> 00:07:58,829
It's just, every once in a while,

184
00:07:58,894 --> 00:08:00,361
you have to remind him
it's the 21st century.

185
00:08:08,286 --> 00:08:10,904
But that's not really him,

186
00:08:10,906 --> 00:08:13,240
the Wells who Eddie gave his life to stop?

187
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:15,626
Apparently not.

188
00:08:18,447 --> 00:08:20,747
That's life in Central City
these days, right?

189
00:08:20,749 --> 00:08:23,717
- You sure?
- Dad, I'm fine, really.

190
00:08:23,719 --> 00:08:26,186
Good.

191
00:08:26,188 --> 00:08:27,354
I want to keep you that way.

192
00:08:27,356 --> 00:08:29,556
- Dad.
- Take it.

193
00:08:29,558 --> 00:08:31,275
I taught you how to use it for a reason.

194
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:33,143
And I'm praying that Barry's right

195
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:34,561
and this Wells means us no harm.

196
00:08:34,563 --> 00:08:36,096
Last year, you had Eddie
to look out for you,

197
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:40,600
but now, you can't murder somebody

198
00:08:40,602 --> 00:08:44,705
that everybody thinks is dead, right?

199
00:08:44,707 --> 00:08:46,874
Put it away.

200
00:08:50,445 --> 00:08:52,046
You do realize that when I said

201
00:08:52,048 --> 00:08:54,214
I wanted a drink, I didn't
mean a latte, right?

202
00:08:54,216 --> 00:08:55,615
I was talking about alcohol.

203
00:08:55,617 --> 00:08:57,334
Like, mind-numbing alcohol.

204
00:08:57,336 --> 00:08:59,803
All right, look, you got give
him a chance, okay?

205
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:01,555
He's not a speedster.

206
00:09:01,557 --> 00:09:05,959
He's just a regular, normal guy
from another universe.

207
00:09:05,961 --> 00:09:08,679
I never thought I'd miss time travel.

208
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:09,897
Time travel, huh?

209
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:11,849
- Hey! Are you kidding?
- Hi!

210
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:14,768
Is there a meta-human who can time travel?

211
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:16,904
Time... no. Time travel's not real.

212
00:09:16,906 --> 00:09:18,188
'Cause that would be pretty cool!

213
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,524
Not so sure about that.

214
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:22,826
Patty, you know Cisco Ramon, right?

215
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:24,978
Yeah, you're the scientific
advisor on meta-humans

216
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,246
to the CCPD, right?

217
00:09:26,248 --> 00:09:27,948
- Yeah, that's me.
- Nice.

218
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,950
Hey, Barr, did you hear
I was right about King Shark?

219
00:09:29,952 --> 00:09:32,369
King Shark? Nice name. I like her.

220
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:34,004
Yeah, yeah, King Shark almost ate The Flash.

221
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:35,873
Oh, nah, I'm sure The Flash had it handled.

222
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,824
Oh, no, I was there. I saw it all.

223
00:09:37,826 --> 00:09:39,593
Some hooded guy saved his life.

224
00:09:39,595 --> 00:09:41,712
Wait, and you're not,
like, traumatized or anything?

225
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:44,047
I just watched a half man-half shark

226
00:09:44,049 --> 00:09:45,849
take on the fastest man alive.

227
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:48,385
I love this city.

228
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:51,171
See... sorry.

229
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:52,890
Oh, uh, Captain just texted me.

230
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:56,276
He wants me to write my police report.

231
00:09:56,278 --> 00:09:58,228
Uh, you maybe want to write it with me?

232
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:01,348
Uh, I can't tonight.
I'm busy. Um, yeah, sorry.

233
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,649
Oh, yeah, okay.

234
00:10:02,651 --> 00:10:04,451
I've just got science stuff.

235
00:10:04,453 --> 00:10:07,354
Stuff I gotta science the stuff out of.

236
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:08,956
Maybe next time.

237
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:12,326
- Yeah! Coolio.
- Yeah.

238
00:10:12,328 --> 00:10:14,294
But I'm gonna actually skip the coffee

239
00:10:14,296 --> 00:10:15,879
and go get a head start, so...

240
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:17,498
- Oh.
- Good to see you guys.

241
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,883
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

242
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:21,502
- For real?
- Stop, all right?

243
00:10:21,504 --> 00:10:23,804
I was gonna ask her out,
and then a man-shark

244
00:10:23,806 --> 00:10:25,539
tried to eat me, and then
Dr. Wells the sequel showed up.

245
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,224
Okay, can we not use the name "Dr. Wells"?

246
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:28,842
I'm just gonna call him "Harry."

247
00:10:28,844 --> 00:10:30,394
Okay. Harry, yeah.

248
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:32,212
Listen, there's always
gonna be Harrys out there,

249
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:33,764
but you can't let the Harrys of the world

250
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:35,649
get in the way of you living your life.

251
00:10:35,651 --> 00:10:37,100
Ask Patty out.

252
00:10:37,102 --> 00:10:38,936
You gotta... you gotta be bold.

253
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:40,487
That's tough talk.

254
00:10:40,489 --> 00:10:44,858
When was the last time
you asked a girl for her number?

255
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,493
Watch and learn.

256
00:10:46,495 --> 00:10:48,728
I'm watching.

257
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:51,448
Hi. What can I get you?

258
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:54,868
- Hi, there.
- Hi... again.

259
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:57,070
Uh...

260
00:10:59,591 --> 00:11:00,907
Do you want some coffee?

261
00:11:00,909 --> 00:11:02,125
Yeah, I'll get some coffee.

262
00:11:02,127 --> 00:11:04,211
No, uh, no, I don't want coffee.

263
00:11:04,213 --> 00:11:05,679
You know what I do want though?

264
00:11:05,681 --> 00:11:07,181
I want to ask you this.

265
00:11:07,183 --> 00:11:10,083
Do you want to go out with me?

266
00:11:12,437 --> 00:11:13,937
Oh.

267
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:17,424
To... we... I mean, we could
go get coffee or we...

268
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:21,061
No.

269
00:11:21,063 --> 00:11:23,096
That's a no.

270
00:11:23,098 --> 00:11:26,033
That's totally cool. It's cool.

271
00:11:26,035 --> 00:11:27,401
Respect.

272
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:56,730
Yo, dude, you good? It's her loss.

273
00:11:58,434 --> 00:11:59,850
Hey, what's up?

274
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:01,235
We have another breacher.

275
00:12:01,237 --> 00:12:02,569
What? How do you know?

276
00:12:02,571 --> 00:12:04,271
Central City Bank. You gotta go now!

277
00:12:04,273 --> 00:12:05,272
All right.

278
00:12:16,449 --> 00:12:17,948
You got my attention.

279
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,750
Flash.

280
00:12:33,348 --> 00:12:36,517
Her name is Doctor Light.

281
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:38,769
Small-time thief on my Earth until exposure

282
00:12:38,771 --> 00:12:40,855
to the dark matter
from the Particle Accelerator

283
00:12:40,857 --> 00:12:42,806
and became a meta-human with the ability

284
00:12:42,808 --> 00:12:44,992
to derive power from starlight.

285
00:12:44,994 --> 00:12:46,527
Oh, very cool.

286
00:12:46,529 --> 00:12:49,313
Stars having a temperature
of 5,300 degree kelvin

287
00:12:49,315 --> 00:12:50,648
and a blinding luminosity, I would say,

288
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:52,223
"Not very cool at all."

289
00:12:52,225 --> 00:12:54,024
You know, our Dr. Wells may have been evil,

290
00:12:54,026 --> 00:12:55,576
but you're just a dick.

291
00:12:55,578 --> 00:12:58,529
Okay, so obviously, Zoom brought her here

292
00:12:58,531 --> 00:13:00,164
from your Earth like the others.

293
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:02,216
Mm-hmm. Now that we know that,

294
00:13:02,218 --> 00:13:03,801
we can use that to gain advantage.

295
00:13:03,803 --> 00:13:05,419
What do you mean?

296
00:13:05,421 --> 00:13:10,141
We capture Doctor Light
and use her to lure Zoom here.

297
00:13:10,143 --> 00:13:11,709
You are insane!

298
00:13:11,711 --> 00:13:13,877
Okay, we are not luring Zoom anywhere!

299
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:15,146
Apparently, they know each other,

300
00:13:15,148 --> 00:13:16,597
and Jay is not a fan.

301
00:13:16,599 --> 00:13:17,648
Huh.

302
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:19,150
Well, well, well.

303
00:13:19,152 --> 00:13:22,053
Like everyone else, I assumed
Earth-2 Flash was dead.

304
00:13:22,055 --> 00:13:24,054
Why am I not surprised
to find Jay Garrick here,

305
00:13:24,056 --> 00:13:28,192
still alive and in hiding
a full universe away from Zoom?

306
00:13:28,194 --> 00:13:29,660
I'm not in hiding.

307
00:13:29,662 --> 00:13:32,580
Zoom nearly killed me and stole my speed

308
00:13:32,582 --> 00:13:34,281
before the Singularity pulled me here.

309
00:13:34,283 --> 00:13:35,783
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that's right.

310
00:13:35,785 --> 00:13:38,202
Well, whatever the case, in your absence,

311
00:13:38,204 --> 00:13:41,789
Zoom has only gotten more powerful, faster.

312
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:44,759
Barry, you have to defeat Zoom
now while you still can.

313
00:13:44,761 --> 00:13:46,577
No, this isn't the time to be reckless.

314
00:13:46,579 --> 00:13:48,429
We don't even know
why Zoom sent Doctor Light here.

315
00:13:48,431 --> 00:13:50,181
She's a thief, not a killer.

316
00:13:50,183 --> 00:13:51,932
Zoom can make people
do things out of character.

317
00:13:51,934 --> 00:13:53,718
Thief or not, she'll kill you.

318
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,136
All right, look, hey,

319
00:13:55,138 --> 00:13:57,271
we can decide what to do with Light later.

320
00:13:57,273 --> 00:13:59,857
First, we have to find her, okay?

321
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:06,263
Hey, how did you know

322
00:14:06,265 --> 00:14:08,149
that she was breaking into the bank?

323
00:14:08,151 --> 00:14:11,101
I got an alert on my phone.

324
00:14:11,103 --> 00:14:13,103
There is a little ring-a-ding

325
00:14:13,105 --> 00:14:14,405
every time, like, there's
a robbery at a bank.

326
00:14:14,407 --> 00:14:15,956
- What?
- But you know what?

327
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:17,875
I think I can get the
S.T.A.R. Labs satellite

328
00:14:17,877 --> 00:14:20,244
to scan for any irregular
solar radiation emissions

329
00:14:20,246 --> 00:14:23,581
and we can find Doctor Light's light.

330
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:27,918
Okay, I'm gonna also call Joe,
see if CCPD has any leads.

331
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,755
Why don't we keep them apart
until I get back?

332
00:14:30,757 --> 00:14:33,390
I am sure that won't be a problem.

333
00:14:44,187 --> 00:14:45,603
- Hey!
- Hey.

334
00:14:45,605 --> 00:14:47,271
How's your science stuff?

335
00:14:47,273 --> 00:14:48,472
I finished it.

336
00:14:48,474 --> 00:14:50,074
Um, did you get your report done?

337
00:14:50,076 --> 00:14:51,609
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

338
00:14:51,611 --> 00:14:55,079
It wasn't as much fun
writing it by myself, but...

339
00:14:55,081 --> 00:14:56,313
I'll see ya.

340
00:14:56,315 --> 00:14:58,148
Yeah.

341
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:02,536
Hey, do you ever feel completely overwhelmed

342
00:15:02,538 --> 00:15:03,821
by everything that you have to do in a day

343
00:15:03,823 --> 00:15:05,456
and it feels like the one thing

344
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:08,459
that you actually want to do
is the thing that gets lost?

345
00:15:08,461 --> 00:15:10,127
I'm confused. What?

346
00:15:10,129 --> 00:15:13,764
I've been thinking, for
a while now actually,

347
00:15:13,766 --> 00:15:15,549
would you want to get dinner
with me sometime?

348
00:15:15,551 --> 00:15:18,018
Yeah, this isn't gonna be one those things

349
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,688
where I get really excited
and then, you know,

350
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,189
more science stuff comes up, right?

351
00:15:22,191 --> 00:15:25,309
No, no, that's not... um, tomorrow?

352
00:15:25,311 --> 00:15:26,811
We can grab an early dinner.

353
00:15:26,813 --> 00:15:29,396
I don't want to wait anymore.

354
00:15:29,398 --> 00:15:33,851
Okay. Looking forward to it.

355
00:15:47,633 --> 00:15:50,217
Hey, Harry.

356
00:15:50,219 --> 00:15:52,303
Hey, over here.

357
00:15:52,305 --> 00:15:54,672
Hey!

358
00:15:54,674 --> 00:15:57,892
Come inside. Use my workroom.
Use my computer!

359
00:15:57,894 --> 00:15:59,810
- I don't care!
- Thanks.

360
00:15:59,812 --> 00:16:01,712
You and Wells prime have
very different musical tastes.

361
00:16:01,714 --> 00:16:03,147
His were better.

362
00:16:03,149 --> 00:16:06,317
This Harrison Wells and I are very different

363
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:07,735
but similar in some respects.

364
00:16:07,737 --> 00:16:09,820
I see he made almost the same mistake I did

365
00:16:09,822 --> 00:16:11,221
with the Particle Accelerator.

366
00:16:11,223 --> 00:16:12,823
He did a lot of terrible things,

367
00:16:12,825 --> 00:16:15,159
and none of them were by mistake.

368
00:16:15,161 --> 00:16:18,195
What did he do to you?

369
00:16:18,197 --> 00:16:19,780
I know he caused the Singularity,

370
00:16:19,782 --> 00:16:21,866
murdered Barry's mother,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

371
00:16:21,868 --> 00:16:23,334
What did he do to you?

372
00:16:23,336 --> 00:16:25,336
You can barely look me in the eye.

373
00:16:25,338 --> 00:16:27,121
Why is that? What did he do to you?

374
00:16:27,123 --> 00:16:30,374
He shoved his hand through my chest.

375
00:16:30,376 --> 00:16:31,542
He stopped my heart.

376
00:16:33,596 --> 00:16:36,347
Ouch, okay, that would do it,

377
00:16:36,349 --> 00:16:38,849
but you survived that.

378
00:16:38,851 --> 00:16:42,419
Only because Barry erased that timeline.

379
00:16:42,421 --> 00:16:44,755
I see. Barry traveled in time.

380
00:16:44,757 --> 00:16:49,193
- Twice.
- Hmm.

381
00:16:49,195 --> 00:16:51,445
- Here's how it is.
- What's the deal?

382
00:16:51,447 --> 00:16:53,063
You don't have to like me.

383
00:16:53,065 --> 00:16:54,732
I don't like you,

384
00:16:54,734 --> 00:16:58,068
but you have to work with me
to stop Zoom and Doctor Light.

385
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:00,788
Can you do that?

386
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,105
I guess we'll see, won't we?

387
00:17:02,107 --> 00:17:04,041
I guess we will.

388
00:17:04,043 --> 00:17:06,043
One more thing...

389
00:17:06,045 --> 00:17:07,444
you said you were going to re-task

390
00:17:07,446 --> 00:17:09,246
the S.T.A.R. Labs satellite?

391
00:17:09,248 --> 00:17:11,548
To scan for solar emissions,
yeah, we're up and running.

392
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:12,750
I'd like to examine your program.

393
00:17:12,752 --> 00:17:14,084
I want to see if it works.

394
00:17:14,086 --> 00:17:16,286
Don't worry. It'll work.

395
00:17:23,345 --> 00:17:25,295
Harry's starting to get on my nerves.

396
00:17:25,297 --> 00:17:27,731
The silent alarm just went off
at the Bank of Central City.

397
00:17:27,733 --> 00:17:30,100
- That's gotta be Doctor Light.
- Could be a trap.

398
00:17:30,102 --> 00:17:32,069
Barry, trust me, Doctor
Light is not a killer.

399
00:17:32,071 --> 00:17:34,905
- You can talk to her.
- Okay.

400
00:17:46,786 --> 00:17:48,919
Looking for this?

401
00:17:48,921 --> 00:17:50,921
I know Zoom sent you here to kill me.

402
00:17:50,923 --> 00:17:52,706
Good news, you don't have to do that.

403
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:54,324
Not if I can get out of town with that cash.

404
00:17:54,326 --> 00:17:55,926
And then what?

405
00:17:55,928 --> 00:17:57,795
Zoom's not gonna like
that you ditched him, right?

406
00:17:57,797 --> 00:17:59,546
My friends and I can help you.

407
00:17:59,548 --> 00:18:02,666
Nobody can protect me from Zoom!

408
00:18:02,668 --> 00:18:03,884
All right, why don't we take it down

409
00:18:03,886 --> 00:18:06,503
a lumen, have a normal conversation,

410
00:18:06,505 --> 00:18:08,839
all right?

411
00:18:08,841 --> 00:18:10,607
Thank you.

412
00:18:12,944 --> 00:18:14,511
Linda?

413
00:18:14,513 --> 00:18:17,281
- Linda Park?
- How do you know my name?

414
00:18:17,283 --> 00:18:19,283
I don't understand.

415
00:18:19,285 --> 00:18:22,286
This was a mistake.

416
00:18:26,792 --> 00:18:28,242
Barry, what's happening?

417
00:18:28,244 --> 00:18:31,545
I can't see. Guys, I can't see.

418
00:18:35,793 --> 00:18:37,610
I still can't see.

419
00:18:37,612 --> 00:18:39,129
How long is this gonna last?

420
00:18:39,131 --> 00:18:41,047
You're suffering from solar retinopathy.

421
00:18:41,049 --> 00:18:43,116
Your retinas are severely damaged.

422
00:18:43,118 --> 00:18:44,668
You're lucky you're not permanently blind.

423
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:46,670
But with your rapid regeneration abilities,

424
00:18:46,672 --> 00:18:47,921
your sight should return soon.

425
00:18:48,549 --> 00:18:50,149
6.25 hours by my estimation.

426
00:18:50,235 --> 00:18:52,068
All this could have been avoided
if you just stopped Light

427
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,636
instead of chitchatting with her.

428
00:18:53,638 --> 00:18:55,137
She caught Barry off guard.

429
00:18:55,139 --> 00:18:57,073
Always an excuse with you, right?

430
00:18:57,075 --> 00:18:59,108
He's the fastest man alive.
How could she possibly do that?

431
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:01,444
Because Light looks exactly
like my ex-girlfriend,

432
00:19:01,446 --> 00:19:03,446
Linda Park.

433
00:19:03,448 --> 00:19:06,082
That's why Zoom sent her...
because he knew you'd hesitate.

434
00:19:06,084 --> 00:19:07,917
That means Zoom had to have known somehow

435
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,535
that Linda was your ex.

436
00:19:09,537 --> 00:19:11,504
Which is why Barry has to act now,

437
00:19:11,506 --> 00:19:13,840
before Zoom sends another double
from Barry's life.

438
00:19:13,842 --> 00:19:15,625
All right, right now,
I'm more worried about Linda.

439
00:19:15,627 --> 00:19:18,928
When I saw who was
under the mask, I said her name.

440
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:20,663
What if Light didn't even
realize that she had

441
00:19:20,665 --> 00:19:22,515
a doppelganger here
until I accidentally told her?

442
00:19:22,517 --> 00:19:24,333
The first thing that Atom Smasher did

443
00:19:24,335 --> 00:19:26,636
when he crossed the breach
was to kill his doppelganger.

444
00:19:26,638 --> 00:19:28,471
Yeah, but Light's not like Atom Smasher.

445
00:19:28,473 --> 00:19:30,173
We should keep an eye on your Linda.

446
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:32,058
All right, I'll go.

447
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,226
- Oh!
- Sorry.

448
00:19:33,228 --> 00:19:34,444
- Bro.
- Barry!

449
00:19:34,446 --> 00:19:36,312
- What? Ooh!
- Okay, okay.

450
00:19:36,405 --> 00:19:38,772
You can't do anything
until your sight returns.

451
00:19:38,774 --> 00:19:41,525
No, no, no, come on,
here's the little rail here.

452
00:19:41,527 --> 00:19:44,195
- I'll do it.
- I'll go with you!

453
00:19:44,197 --> 00:19:45,696
- Hey, Barry!
- Hey.

454
00:19:45,698 --> 00:19:48,415
I came as soon as I heard...

455
00:19:48,417 --> 00:19:50,284
You look just like him.

456
00:19:50,286 --> 00:19:51,919
I'm guessing my counterpart
did something to offend her

457
00:19:51,921 --> 00:19:53,087
as well?

458
00:19:53,089 --> 00:19:55,122
Her fiancé died because of him.

459
00:19:55,124 --> 00:19:57,124
Oh.

460
00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:03,881
Iris, I know it's weird seeing him.

461
00:20:03,883 --> 00:20:05,933
Yeah, it's just a lot to process lately.

462
00:20:05,935 --> 00:20:08,269
Wells, my mother.

463
00:20:08,271 --> 00:20:10,837
How are you doing with that, by the way?

464
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:14,174
I mean, now that she's gone,

465
00:20:14,176 --> 00:20:16,193
okay.

466
00:20:16,195 --> 00:20:18,062
Yeah, Iris, um, look...

467
00:20:18,064 --> 00:20:19,230
Yeah.

468
00:20:19,232 --> 00:20:20,531
Thanks.

469
00:20:20,533 --> 00:20:22,516
You know you can talk to me about it.

470
00:20:22,518 --> 00:20:25,536
Yeah, I know, but really, I'm fine, okay?

471
00:20:25,538 --> 00:20:27,288
I should be asking how you're doing.

472
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:29,874
That's me. I got it.

473
00:20:29,876 --> 00:20:31,709
- Barry, let me help you.
- I got it.

474
00:20:31,711 --> 00:20:33,878
All right.

475
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,697
Uh, "Running a little late. P."

476
00:20:36,699 --> 00:20:37,631
Who's P?

477
00:20:37,633 --> 00:20:39,866
P.

478
00:20:39,868 --> 00:20:41,802
- That's Patty.
- My dad's partner Patty?

479
00:20:41,804 --> 00:20:43,036
Mm-hmm.

480
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:44,305
What is she running late for?

481
00:20:44,307 --> 00:20:47,424
Um, our first date.

482
00:20:47,426 --> 00:20:50,311
That's so great! She's great.

483
00:20:50,313 --> 00:20:52,513
Yeah, no, Patty's great. I just, you know...

484
00:20:52,515 --> 00:20:54,181
I doubt she's gonna give me another shot

485
00:20:54,183 --> 00:20:55,382
when I have to cancel on her.

486
00:20:55,384 --> 00:20:56,901
Don't cancel.

487
00:20:56,903 --> 00:20:59,486
I'm blind, Iris. A literal blind date.

488
00:20:59,488 --> 00:21:00,554
It's not gonna work.

489
00:21:00,556 --> 00:21:02,055
Hey, we are in S.T.A.R. Labs.

490
00:21:02,057 --> 00:21:03,440
Come on, there's gotta be something here

491
00:21:03,442 --> 00:21:05,075
that can help you get through the night.

492
00:21:05,077 --> 00:21:07,227
Yeah.

493
00:21:07,229 --> 00:21:09,997
Or someone.

494
00:21:12,834 --> 00:21:14,868
Cisco, hey!

495
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:18,071
- To your left. Other left.
- Cisco.

496
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:25,346
Sorry.

497
00:21:27,915 --> 00:21:29,916
Ooh, sorry.

498
00:21:29,918 --> 00:21:33,804
Okay. She's two steps in front of you.

499
00:21:33,806 --> 00:21:36,590
- Nice glasses.
- Hey, hey!

500
00:21:36,592 --> 00:21:38,592
- Touchdown.
- I'm so sorry I'm late.

501
00:21:38,594 --> 00:21:40,144
No, don't be.

502
00:21:40,146 --> 00:21:41,729
You know, I actually judge
my dates on whether or not

503
00:21:41,731 --> 00:21:44,148
they stand me up,
so you are off to a great start.

504
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:45,866
What do you mean? Who would stand you up?

505
00:21:45,868 --> 00:21:47,618
Oh, I have a reputation.

506
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:51,705
Not that kind of reputation.
That's not what I meant.

507
00:21:51,707 --> 00:21:53,707
That's embarrassing.

508
00:21:53,709 --> 00:21:56,043
You know, I actually...
I arrested a boyfriend once.

509
00:21:56,045 --> 00:21:57,411
Oh.

510
00:21:57,413 --> 00:21:59,413
A very ex-boyfriend,
while we were at dinner.

511
00:21:59,415 --> 00:22:02,416
He got really wasted and decided
to insult the waitress,

512
00:22:02,418 --> 00:22:04,551
so I cited him for public intoxication.

513
00:22:04,553 --> 00:22:06,754
- That is hilarious.
- Yeah.

514
00:22:06,756 --> 00:22:09,757
Special.

515
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:11,976
So...

516
00:22:11,978 --> 00:22:13,477
Dude, she looks amazing.

517
00:22:13,479 --> 00:22:15,312
You have to tell her how amazing she looks.

518
00:22:15,314 --> 00:22:17,431
You look amazing, Patty.

519
00:22:17,433 --> 00:22:20,401
Uh, thanks, I actually
had a really hard time

520
00:22:20,403 --> 00:22:22,186
trying to figure out what to wear, like,

521
00:22:22,188 --> 00:22:25,072
if I should wear a dress or if
this color was a little weird.

522
00:22:25,074 --> 00:22:26,640
No, you look great.

523
00:22:26,642 --> 00:22:30,744
Um, yeah, no, that...
what would you call that color?

524
00:22:30,746 --> 00:22:32,946
- Um, uh...
- I can't tell.

525
00:22:32,948 --> 00:22:34,531
The feed's black and white. I don't know.

526
00:22:34,533 --> 00:22:36,834
Yeah, whatever it is,
that color should thank you

527
00:22:36,836 --> 00:22:38,202
for wearing it.

528
00:22:38,204 --> 00:22:40,004
My man.

529
00:22:40,006 --> 00:22:42,790
- Smooth.
- Not smooth.

530
00:22:44,627 --> 00:22:46,827
Oh, wine list. Here we go.

531
00:22:46,829 --> 00:22:51,098
Uh, yes, uh, got it. Thank you.

532
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,433
Um...

533
00:22:52,435 --> 00:22:54,852
Um, you know, why don't you... Oop!

534
00:22:54,854 --> 00:22:56,437
- Sorry.
- No, that's okay.

535
00:22:56,439 --> 00:22:58,272
The guy always picks. Why don't you choose?

536
00:22:58,274 --> 00:23:02,342
Yeah, what do you want, red or white?

537
00:23:02,344 --> 00:23:04,445
Whatever you'd like. Uh, yeah.

538
00:23:04,447 --> 00:23:06,847
You got this. Why do you even need me?

539
00:23:14,739 --> 00:23:16,356
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

540
00:23:16,358 --> 00:23:17,458
Classic stakeout fuel.

541
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,792
Yeah.

542
00:23:18,794 --> 00:23:20,694
You have coffee on your Earth, right?

543
00:23:20,696 --> 00:23:23,080
I think coffee's the one
constant in the multiverse.

544
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:29,086
So I don't mean to pry,
but when Wells keeps referring

545
00:23:29,088 --> 00:23:31,872
to you and Zoom, what's he talking about?

546
00:23:31,874 --> 00:23:33,707
I fought Zoom many times,

547
00:23:33,709 --> 00:23:35,976
each time barely escaping with my life.

548
00:23:37,762 --> 00:23:39,763
So yeah.

549
00:23:39,765 --> 00:23:41,815
Maybe I didn't always
confront him when I should have.

550
00:23:41,817 --> 00:23:43,350
Truth is, Zoom scared me.

551
00:23:43,352 --> 00:23:47,521
He stole the most precious thing my speed.

552
00:23:47,523 --> 00:23:49,556
I didn't want Barry to suffer the same fate.

553
00:23:49,558 --> 00:23:51,992
Well, maybe if you just sat down with Wells,

554
00:23:51,994 --> 00:23:53,494
talked to him about it...

555
00:23:53,496 --> 00:23:55,496
No, no, no. Do not trust Wells, Caitlin.

556
00:23:55,498 --> 00:23:57,063
The guy was more than happy to make money

557
00:23:57,065 --> 00:23:58,916
off the meta-human problem
with his tech apps,

558
00:23:58,918 --> 00:24:00,834
and now he's obsessed with Zoom.

559
00:24:00,836 --> 00:24:04,171
Something has changed and not
just because I disappeared.

560
00:24:06,257 --> 00:24:09,760
Well, I don't trust Wells. I trust you.

561
00:24:14,717 --> 00:24:16,016
So I've actually been dying to ask you,

562
00:24:16,018 --> 00:24:17,351
what was it like to be struck by lightning?

563
00:24:17,353 --> 00:24:20,921
Mm. Life-changing, to be honest.

564
00:24:20,923 --> 00:24:22,523
Did it hurt?

565
00:24:22,525 --> 00:24:25,109
I mean, all I really remember
is feeling electricity

566
00:24:25,111 --> 00:24:26,527
surging through my body.

567
00:24:26,529 --> 00:24:28,595
It was an intensity I had never felt,

568
00:24:28,597 --> 00:24:33,200
like I was instantly connected
to everything around me.

569
00:24:33,202 --> 00:24:35,369
Then I woke up from a coma
nine months later.

570
00:24:35,371 --> 00:24:37,103
Waking up in the future like that,

571
00:24:37,105 --> 00:24:39,940
it's like time travel.

572
00:24:41,243 --> 00:24:42,826
- Sort of, yeah.
- Yeah.

573
00:24:42,828 --> 00:24:46,463
When I was nine, I actually drowned.

574
00:24:46,465 --> 00:24:48,081
I hit my head on the diving board

575
00:24:48,083 --> 00:24:49,750
and fell into the swimming pool.

576
00:24:49,752 --> 00:24:52,786
Uh, my heart stopped for,
I think, two minutes

577
00:24:52,788 --> 00:24:55,556
until my dad rescued me and saved my life.

578
00:24:55,558 --> 00:24:56,924
Yeah.

579
00:24:56,926 --> 00:24:59,927
So I guess we've both cheated death.

580
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,313
I've been through a few things in my life

581
00:25:03,315 --> 00:25:05,482
that taught me not to be afraid of anything.

582
00:25:05,484 --> 00:25:07,133
I think fear is what holds people back

583
00:25:07,135 --> 00:25:09,186
from being who they should be.

584
00:25:09,188 --> 00:25:11,488
Ugh, preach!

585
00:25:13,275 --> 00:25:14,474
Yeah, I'm still here, creepin' and peepin'.

586
00:25:14,476 --> 00:25:15,943
You okay?

587
00:25:15,945 --> 00:25:19,696
Sorry, I just...
Yeah, I really agree with that.

588
00:25:19,698 --> 00:25:21,582
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

589
00:25:21,584 --> 00:25:27,037
I think another thing, too,
I think you can't see me.

590
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,756
- Abort!
- What? What do you mean?

591
00:25:29,758 --> 00:25:31,592
I think you can't see me.

592
00:25:31,594 --> 00:25:33,177
Come on, I would not be a good detective

593
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:34,678
if I couldn't have figured this one out.

594
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,631
I don't know.

595
00:25:37,633 --> 00:25:40,517
- Uh, yeah.
- Yeah.

596
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:44,004
I'm really sorry and embarrassed

597
00:25:44,006 --> 00:25:45,389
I didn't say anything.

598
00:25:45,391 --> 00:25:48,508
- I had my pupils dilated earlier.
- Barry.

599
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:50,194
Oh, my God! Barry!

600
00:25:50,196 --> 00:25:52,646
And I really didn't want to cancel.

601
00:25:52,648 --> 00:25:56,650
Barry! I lost my eyes!

602
00:25:56,652 --> 00:26:00,020
No, you have a great smile.

603
00:26:00,022 --> 00:26:02,656
Really, how do you know I'm smiling?

604
00:26:02,658 --> 00:26:03,790
Just a hunch.

605
00:26:07,129 --> 00:26:09,663
Okay, so what else
is different about our worlds?

606
00:26:09,665 --> 00:26:11,548
Do you have Tahiti?

607
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:14,034
Never been, but I do love Atlantis.

608
00:26:14,036 --> 00:26:15,969
As in the lost city submerged
in the ocean somewhere?

609
00:26:15,971 --> 00:26:18,538
Well, it's actually above water on my Earth.

610
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,973
One of my best friends is from there.

611
00:26:19,975 --> 00:26:21,374
I would love to see it.

612
00:26:21,376 --> 00:26:23,877
It's special.

613
00:26:23,879 --> 00:26:26,880
It's the kind of place
you never want to leave.

614
00:26:54,375 --> 00:26:56,009
Hello, gorgeous.

615
00:26:56,011 --> 00:26:57,711
Everybody out, now! Go!

616
00:26:57,713 --> 00:27:00,931
Go, go, go. Go, move, quick.

617
00:27:00,933 --> 00:27:03,216
- Except you.
- I don't think so.

618
00:27:03,218 --> 00:27:04,801
No, no, she's leaving with us.

619
00:27:04,803 --> 00:27:07,804
- Not today.
- What do you want from me?

620
00:27:07,806 --> 00:27:09,756
Your life.

621
00:27:13,086 --> 00:27:15,588
Doctor Light.

622
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:17,523
Oh, no. Go.

623
00:27:25,073 --> 00:27:26,407
I've never killed anyone before,

624
00:27:26,459 --> 00:27:28,259
but it's not murder
if it's your double, right?

625
00:27:28,261 --> 00:27:29,761
Why are you doing this?

626
00:27:29,763 --> 00:27:32,046
It's the only way that I can stay alive.

627
00:27:32,048 --> 00:27:33,598
To become you.

628
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,882
I'm sorry, Linda.

629
00:27:37,304 --> 00:27:39,854
No!

630
00:27:44,143 --> 00:27:46,978
- How is this possible?
- You couldn't understand.

631
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,030
Light!

632
00:27:49,032 --> 00:27:50,398
Flash.

633
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,817
I thought I took care of you outside.

634
00:28:04,029 --> 00:28:05,430
Please don't let go. I may trip.

635
00:28:05,432 --> 00:28:07,915
Okay, I won't. I promise.

636
00:28:07,917 --> 00:28:10,668
- Two more steps.
- All right. Missed one.

637
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:13,304
There you go.

638
00:28:13,306 --> 00:28:15,773
It's funny how we skipped

639
00:28:15,775 --> 00:28:18,559
straight to the hand-holding part.

640
00:28:18,561 --> 00:28:21,562
Yes.

641
00:28:21,564 --> 00:28:24,482
We, uh, have arrived at my car, so...

642
00:28:24,484 --> 00:28:26,984
Ah.

643
00:28:26,986 --> 00:28:32,223
Well, do you think we've reached
the good night kiss stage?

644
00:28:32,225 --> 00:28:33,891
Um...

645
00:28:51,511 --> 00:28:55,380
Um, this is burgundy, by the way,

646
00:28:55,382 --> 00:28:56,881
and you look great in it.

647
00:28:56,883 --> 00:28:59,684
- Now you can see?
- I can.

648
00:28:59,686 --> 00:29:01,936
That must have been some kiss.

649
00:29:01,938 --> 00:29:05,223
I guess so.

650
00:29:06,426 --> 00:29:08,526
- Sorry.
- No, it's mine too.

651
00:29:08,528 --> 00:29:10,594
Weird. Cisco, hey.

652
00:29:10,596 --> 00:29:12,447
Sir?

653
00:29:16,201 --> 00:29:18,903
I saw myself.

654
00:29:18,905 --> 00:29:21,272
How is that even possible?

655
00:29:21,274 --> 00:29:24,575
Sounds like you have an evil meta-twin.

656
00:29:24,577 --> 00:29:28,713
And now Larkin's dead

657
00:29:28,715 --> 00:29:31,499
because someone who
looks like me wanted to kill me?

658
00:29:31,501 --> 00:29:33,084
Linda, none of this is your fault.

659
00:29:33,086 --> 00:29:35,420
We're gonna figure it all out, I promise.

660
00:29:35,422 --> 00:29:37,088
How you doing?

661
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:40,758
I'm alive, thanks to Iris.

662
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,644
Turns out she's as badass
with a gun as she is with a pen.

663
00:29:43,646 --> 00:29:45,129
Yeah, she is.

664
00:29:45,131 --> 00:29:46,464
I'm just happy that you're safe.

665
00:29:46,466 --> 00:29:48,015
I've arranged a security detail

666
00:29:48,017 --> 00:29:49,484
around the clock, just to be sure.

667
00:29:49,486 --> 00:29:51,352
I can take you to them if you're ready.

668
00:29:51,354 --> 00:29:53,637
Yeah.

669
00:29:57,777 --> 00:29:59,610
This is because of me.
I should've been here.

670
00:29:59,612 --> 00:30:00,995
Barry, you were blind.

671
00:30:00,997 --> 00:30:02,780
There's nothing that you could have done.

672
00:30:02,782 --> 00:30:04,949
You think this mask
can help us find that woman?

673
00:30:04,951 --> 00:30:07,452
Any evidence on this
is just gonna match Linda.

674
00:30:07,454 --> 00:30:09,337
I'll think of something else.

675
00:30:09,339 --> 00:30:11,506
Light's not gonna kill again.

676
00:30:14,259 --> 00:30:16,210
Caitlin, are you guys okay?

677
00:30:16,212 --> 00:30:18,829
- Yeah.
- Barry, I'm sorry.

678
00:30:18,831 --> 00:30:20,164
Doctor Light's never killed before.

679
00:30:20,166 --> 00:30:21,966
I thought we could reason with her.

680
00:30:21,968 --> 00:30:25,636
You cannot reason with someone
under Zoom's influence,

681
00:30:25,638 --> 00:30:28,105
and now a man is dead
because of you, Garrick.

682
00:30:28,107 --> 00:30:29,941
This whole thing is because of you.

683
00:30:29,943 --> 00:30:31,609
He doubts himself because of you,

684
00:30:31,611 --> 00:30:34,278
but believe me,
Barry can do what you could not.

685
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,780
Barry can stop Zoom.

686
00:30:35,782 --> 00:30:37,565
I spent two years hunting Zoom.

687
00:30:37,567 --> 00:30:40,985
Wrong! Zoom hunted you!

688
00:30:40,987 --> 00:30:42,954
You spent the last two years of your life

689
00:30:42,956 --> 00:30:45,456
running, running, running from Zoom.

690
00:30:45,458 --> 00:30:47,792
Zoom would have killed me
just like he will kill Barry

691
00:30:47,794 --> 00:30:49,360
if you lead him down this path!

692
00:30:49,362 --> 00:30:51,212
No, because he is not like you.

693
00:30:51,214 --> 00:30:53,714
Barry runs towards danger, not from it,

694
00:30:53,716 --> 00:30:55,883
because Barry's not a coward.

695
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,514
Enough!

696
00:31:13,903 --> 00:31:15,319
You were pretty hard on Jay in there.

697
00:31:15,321 --> 00:31:19,273
Maybe you should be hard on Jay too.

698
00:31:19,275 --> 00:31:20,908
I've seen what you can do, Barry.

699
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:23,327
I've calculated how fast you can run,

700
00:31:23,329 --> 00:31:26,581
and you should be teaching Jay,
not the other way around.

701
00:31:30,068 --> 00:31:33,621
You know, before I learned
that the other Wells

702
00:31:33,623 --> 00:31:37,542
was the man who murdered my mom,
I looked up to him.

703
00:31:37,544 --> 00:31:39,710
He was my mentor, actually.

704
00:31:42,214 --> 00:31:47,018
So my doppelganger,

705
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:49,420
a man who looks exactly like me,

706
00:31:49,422 --> 00:31:51,389
betrayed you.

707
00:31:51,391 --> 00:31:52,723
Mm.

708
00:31:52,725 --> 00:31:54,976
I'm sorry, I'm not him,

709
00:31:54,978 --> 00:31:57,862
so you need to listen to me
when I say you can

710
00:31:57,864 --> 00:32:01,983
take care of Zoom, and all we have to do

711
00:32:01,985 --> 00:32:03,784
is capture Doctor Light.

712
00:32:03,786 --> 00:32:07,605
I thought about testing
the mask for Light's DNA,

713
00:32:07,607 --> 00:32:09,106
but it would only have Linda's.

714
00:32:09,108 --> 00:32:12,209
The mask, what mask?

715
00:32:12,211 --> 00:32:13,744
Light's mask.

716
00:32:16,214 --> 00:32:17,832
How did you get this?

717
00:32:17,834 --> 00:32:19,884
Iris shot it off Doctor Light
when she attacked Linda.

718
00:32:19,886 --> 00:32:21,836
You know how to use the mask to find Light?

719
00:32:21,838 --> 00:32:23,120
Yes, I do.

720
00:32:23,122 --> 00:32:25,789
All we have to do is give it to him.

721
00:32:25,791 --> 00:32:26,957
Why me?

722
00:32:26,959 --> 00:32:30,061
Because you have powers.

723
00:32:32,065 --> 00:32:35,566
What are you talking about?

724
00:32:35,568 --> 00:32:38,769
I developed this watch
to detect meta-humans.

725
00:32:46,278 --> 00:32:49,363
You never got an alert on your phone.

726
00:32:49,365 --> 00:32:55,002
You never reprogrammed
the S.T.A.R. Labs satellite,

727
00:32:55,004 --> 00:32:56,587
and this is why.

728
00:32:58,875 --> 00:33:00,791
He's a meta-human.

729
00:33:06,264 --> 00:33:08,032
Cisco, have you known about this,

730
00:33:08,034 --> 00:33:09,300
and you didn't say anything to us?

731
00:33:09,302 --> 00:33:11,268
Yeah, I was gonna tell you.

732
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:12,436
Thanks a lot, Harry.

733
00:33:12,438 --> 00:33:17,274
I swear I was, but I didn't.

734
00:33:17,276 --> 00:33:20,778
- I was just... I was afraid.
- Afraid of what?

735
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:24,949
Dr. Wells said the dark matter
gave me this, this gift.

736
00:33:24,951 --> 00:33:29,954
He said that one day I'd thank him for it.

737
00:33:29,956 --> 00:33:31,739
What if I become like him?

738
00:33:31,741 --> 00:33:35,326
Cisco, I don't think
any of us would become evil

739
00:33:35,328 --> 00:33:36,660
if we all of sudden got powers,

740
00:33:36,662 --> 00:33:38,212
even if they were from Dr. Wells.

741
00:33:38,214 --> 00:33:42,499
Yeah, maybe you're right.

742
00:33:42,501 --> 00:33:44,551
I should have said something.

743
00:33:44,553 --> 00:33:46,387
That's my fault. I'm sorry.

744
00:33:46,389 --> 00:33:47,805
Well, you can be sorry later,

745
00:33:47,807 --> 00:33:49,390
because right now, we
have to use your powers

746
00:33:49,392 --> 00:33:50,841
to find Doctor Light.

747
00:33:50,843 --> 00:33:54,211
Cisco, your abilities, how do they work?

748
00:33:54,213 --> 00:33:56,730
Uh, I get these feelings sometimes,

749
00:33:56,732 --> 00:33:59,716
these vibes, visions of the breachers

750
00:33:59,718 --> 00:34:01,185
when they come to this Earth.

751
00:34:01,187 --> 00:34:02,820
I just... I'm not sure what triggers it.

752
00:34:02,822 --> 00:34:04,738
Sometimes it just happens.

753
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:07,557
Sometimes it's when I'm touching
something of theirs.

754
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:09,660
Touch the mask.

755
00:34:09,662 --> 00:34:11,996
You want to find Doctor Light, do it.

756
00:34:28,579 --> 00:34:31,081
Hmm.

757
00:34:33,852 --> 00:34:36,586
Hmm.

758
00:34:36,588 --> 00:34:39,723
- I don't think it's working.
- Try again.

759
00:34:41,192 --> 00:34:44,228
- Try again!
- Whoa.

760
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:54,604
- I'm sorry, it's not...
- Again!

761
00:34:54,606 --> 00:34:56,907
- I can't control it.
- Because you're afraid.

762
00:34:56,909 --> 00:34:58,459
I'm telling you I don't know how it works!

763
00:34:58,461 --> 00:35:00,127
I can't just make it happen!

764
00:35:00,129 --> 00:35:02,830
I'm telling you, yes, you can!

765
00:35:11,473 --> 00:35:15,592
South Plaza train station, platform 15.

766
00:35:15,594 --> 00:35:18,395
What are you waiting for?

767
00:35:26,187 --> 00:35:28,138
Oh, guys, the platform's crowded.

768
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,490
Are you sure she's here?

769
00:35:29,492 --> 00:35:30,991
She should be wearing a black trench coat.

770
00:35:30,993 --> 00:35:34,144
Black trench coat. Found her.

771
00:35:34,146 --> 00:35:37,748
Everybody, get out of here. Go, go, hurry!

772
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,454
Why won't you just let me leave?

773
00:35:43,456 --> 00:35:46,006
I can't let you leave.
You killed an innocent man.

774
00:35:46,008 --> 00:35:47,374
That was an accident.

775
00:35:47,376 --> 00:35:49,510
Trying to kill Linda Park wasn't.

776
00:35:49,512 --> 00:35:52,096
It's the only way that I
can be free from Zoom,

777
00:35:52,098 --> 00:35:53,380
unless I kill you.

778
00:35:53,382 --> 00:35:54,998
I can't let you do that either,

779
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,500
so we've got a problem.

780
00:35:56,502 --> 00:35:58,552
We'll see.

781
00:35:58,554 --> 00:36:00,437
Guys, should have talked
about this before I left,

782
00:36:00,439 --> 00:36:01,722
but how should I stop her?

783
00:36:01,724 --> 00:36:02,890
Keep trying different angles, Barry.

784
00:36:02,892 --> 00:36:04,441
Find her blind spot.

785
00:36:09,147 --> 00:36:11,532
I can't get close enough. What should I do?

786
00:36:11,534 --> 00:36:13,066
I don't know.

787
00:36:13,068 --> 00:36:14,568
I gotta tell ya, that's not exactly

788
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:16,820
the answer I was looking for.

789
00:36:16,822 --> 00:36:18,355
You need to confuse her.

790
00:36:18,357 --> 00:36:19,623
Give her more than one target,

791
00:36:19,625 --> 00:36:21,041
so she does not know who to fire at.

792
00:36:21,043 --> 00:36:22,743
All right, how do I do that?

793
00:36:22,745 --> 00:36:25,579
By running so fast,
you create multiple afterimages

794
00:36:25,581 --> 00:36:28,298
of yourself, you create a speed mirage.

795
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:31,552
A wha... speed mir...
I've never run that fast.

796
00:36:31,554 --> 00:36:33,003
Well, from what I've been told,

797
00:36:33,005 --> 00:36:34,421
you've traveled through time.

798
00:36:34,423 --> 00:36:36,340
You'll be more than fast enough.

799
00:36:36,342 --> 00:36:38,208
Okay.

800
00:36:55,243 --> 00:36:57,528
- Barry?
- I can't do it.

801
00:36:57,530 --> 00:36:59,997
Yes, you can, Barry.
Hey, Dr. Wells is right.

802
00:36:59,999 --> 00:37:02,032
You are fast, faster than I ever was

803
00:37:02,034 --> 00:37:03,700
and better than I ever will be.

804
00:37:03,702 --> 00:37:06,003
Don't let fear and doubt
hold you back like it did to me.

805
00:37:06,005 --> 00:37:07,404
You're The Flash, Barry.

806
00:37:07,406 --> 00:37:09,506
Show Light what that means.

807
00:37:21,186 --> 00:37:22,719
Where are you?

808
00:37:27,775 --> 00:37:30,360
I'm right here.

809
00:37:35,527 --> 00:37:36,777
Doctor Light is safely
locked in the pipeline.

810
00:37:36,779 --> 00:37:38,929
Nicely done.

811
00:37:38,931 --> 00:37:41,832
Wells, thank you for helping Barry

812
00:37:41,834 --> 00:37:42,867
put away Doctor Light.

813
00:37:42,869 --> 00:37:44,668
So what now?

814
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:47,788
We do what Dr. Wells said.

815
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:50,941
We use her to lure Zoom here,
end this once and for all.

816
00:37:51,908 --> 00:37:53,207
You can't be serious.

817
00:37:53,209 --> 00:37:54,142
More breachers are gonna come.

818
00:37:54,238 --> 00:37:55,688
More innocent people may die.

819
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,823
I can't let this happen anymore.

820
00:37:57,825 --> 00:37:59,492
You're making a mistake.

821
00:37:59,494 --> 00:38:02,945
Okay, Zoom is a nightmare
you can't wake up from.

822
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:05,414
I've already had my worst nightmare.

823
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:06,866
His name was Reverse Flash,

824
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:09,785
and I spent a long time being afraid of him.

825
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:12,121
I'm not gonna be afraid anymore.

826
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,457
Okay, Barry.

827
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:16,175
You may be faster than me,

828
00:38:16,177 --> 00:38:18,544
but you're not ready
to fight Zoom by yourself.

829
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,513
That's just it, Jay.

830
00:38:20,515 --> 00:38:22,164
I'm not gonna fight him by myself.

831
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:23,832
I've got all of them to help me.

832
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:26,835
I've got Dr. Wells.

833
00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:28,938
I've got you.

834
00:38:30,673 --> 00:38:33,359
No, I can't in good conscience
help you when I know

835
00:38:33,361 --> 00:38:36,011
it'll only lead to you losing your speed,

836
00:38:36,013 --> 00:38:37,846
or even worse,

837
00:38:37,848 --> 00:38:39,848
your death.

838
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:42,785
Optimism must be an Earth-1 thing.

839
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:46,522
You all need to ask yourself
why this man, for years,

840
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:48,491
wouldn't admit that he was responsible

841
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:51,043
for the Particle Accelerator
exploding underground.

842
00:38:51,045 --> 00:38:54,463
He may not be Harrison
Wells from your Earth,

843
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:57,666
but he has just as many secrets
as the one you knew.

844
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:02,704
Jay, please don't go.

845
00:39:04,758 --> 00:39:06,892
I'm so sorry, Caitlin.

846
00:39:15,268 --> 00:39:16,852
Have a nice day.

847
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:18,654
What can I get... you?

848
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:20,773
Yeah, I know, this is supes awkward,

849
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,324
probably more for me than for you,

850
00:39:22,326 --> 00:39:24,360
but I just want coffee, okay?

851
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:27,112
Just three flashes, one of them decaf.

852
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:28,747
That's it.

853
00:39:32,285 --> 00:39:35,454
Are you sure that's all you want?

854
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:36,705
Oh, that's funny.

855
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,073
You just want to shoot me down again, huh?

856
00:39:38,075 --> 00:39:40,509
No, no, no, no.

857
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:44,930
What I mean is, I just
moved to Central City,

858
00:39:44,932 --> 00:39:48,250
and it's a pretty big change
from where I come from.

859
00:39:48,252 --> 00:39:50,052
Everything here is so big and new

860
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:52,388
and filled with meta-humans.

861
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,558
Yeah, well, when you factor in
the size of the city,

862
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,093
the chances of running into a meta-human are

863
00:39:58,095 --> 00:39:59,311
actually pretty low.

864
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:02,314
I guess what I'm trying to say is,

865
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:05,868
you kinda caught me off guard the other day,

866
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:07,903
but now I'm a little more prepared,

867
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:12,625
so I just want to make sure,
is coffee all you want?

868
00:40:16,296 --> 00:40:18,747
Hi, I'm Cisco Ramon.

869
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,782
Kendra Saunders.

870
00:40:20,784 --> 00:40:22,551
It's nice to meet you.

871
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:23,919
Are you okay?

872
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:25,671
Yeah, I just...

873
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:28,340
I was getting used to Jay
being part of the team.

874
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:30,893
Well, look, Jay is a hero.

875
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:34,480
They always seem to show up
just when you need 'em.

876
00:40:34,482 --> 00:40:37,233
Yo, peep that.

877
00:40:37,235 --> 00:40:38,734
Wow!

878
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:39,985
That's how it's done, young Padawan.

879
00:40:39,987 --> 00:40:41,353
- Nice.
- Going on a date next week.

880
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:43,155
Things are looking up for Cisco Ramon.

881
00:40:43,157 --> 00:40:44,356
I guess so.

882
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:45,974
Still stuck with these powers, though.

883
00:40:45,976 --> 00:40:47,576
Just don't know how to feel about 'em.

884
00:40:47,578 --> 00:40:49,278
Hey, look,

885
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,280
you don't gotta go through it alone.

886
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,949
And now you need a cool name.

887
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:57,419
Oh, snap! You're totally right.

888
00:40:57,421 --> 00:40:59,338
I gotta think about this one.

889
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:00,673
Well, you know me. It's gotta be perfect.

890
00:41:00,675 --> 00:41:02,124
- Mm-hmm.
- Something that really sings,

891
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,509
you know?

892
00:41:03,511 --> 00:41:05,544
Something like...

893
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:07,496
Vibe?

894
00:41:07,498 --> 00:41:10,499
Vibe.

895
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:13,102
Vibe.

896
00:41:27,514 --> 00:41:29,378
_

897
00:41:32,956 --> 00:41:35,658
Your father has abandoned you.

898
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,076
You're lying!

899
00:41:37,078 --> 00:41:39,712
My father's the smartest man alive.

900
00:41:39,714 --> 00:41:43,832
He'll find me, he'll save me,
and then he'll kill you.

901
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:47,869
I will not die.

902
00:41:47,871 --> 00:41:50,839
What happens to you and your father

903
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:54,143
is still to be decided.
