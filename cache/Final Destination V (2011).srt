1
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:49,980
<i>Good morning, Presage employees.</i>

2
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:52,053
<i>We hope you're all
ready for our exciting</i>

3
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:53,414
<i>team-building retreat.</i>

4
00:03:53,589 --> 00:03:54,806
<i>Please enjoy your breakfast,</i>

5
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,329
<i>and then make your way to the bus,
which will leave shortly.</i>

6
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:58,281
Hey, Sam?

7
00:03:59,007 --> 00:04:01,000
When I said, would you put breakfast
together for the retreat?

8
00:04:01,025 --> 00:04:02,480
I meant, like, some stale doughnuts...

9
00:04:03,267 --> 00:04:04,010
some coffee.

10
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,511
But this is amazing.

11
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:08,847
Thanks, man. Just remember that when you
see my sales report for last month.

12
00:04:09,774 --> 00:04:10,708
I saw it last night.

13
00:04:10,914 --> 00:04:11,489
Shit.

14
00:04:11,934 --> 00:04:12,916
Has Dennis seen it?

15
00:04:13,314 --> 00:04:14,041
Not yet.

16
00:04:14,328 --> 00:04:14,861
Look,

17
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:16,202
you just need to make a decision,

18
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:17,871
you know? Are you gonna be
chef...

19
00:04:18,427 --> 00:04:19,941
or are you gonna be sales guy?

20
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,417
I'm saying that as your friend, because...

21
00:04:22,441 --> 00:04:24,759
as your boss, I'm ready to fire your ass.

22
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:25,920
As your friend,

23
00:04:25,944 --> 00:04:27,766
I appreciate that advice.
Good.

24
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:33,917
Hold on man, I'll be right back.

25
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:42,437
Molly.

26
00:04:42,601 --> 00:04:44,029
Your ticket is canceled.

27
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,089
Tell me that's a mistake.

28
00:04:46,482 --> 00:04:48,156
I was gonna tell you after this weekend.

29
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:49,825
Tell me what?

30
00:04:50,239 --> 00:04:51,237
That I don't...

31
00:04:51,739 --> 00:04:53,132
think it's such a good idea.

32
00:04:53,571 --> 00:04:54,605
What, the trip?

33
00:04:55,069 --> 00:04:55,533
It's...

34
00:04:56,145 --> 00:04:57,208
my brother's wedding.

35
00:04:58,425 --> 00:04:59,559
What's going on here?

36
00:05:00,579 --> 00:05:02,268
We should talk about this later.
Let's just...

37
00:05:02,293 --> 00:05:04,629
Like I know and pretend that I haven't seen
these for the next 2 days?

38
00:05:04,654 --> 00:05:06,164
No, let's talk about this now.

39
00:05:06,518 --> 00:05:08,063
It's not working out, Sam.

40
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,057
We're not working out.

41
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:16,963
Hey.

42
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:18,223
Hey.

43
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,650
It's, Candice, right?

44
00:05:20,676 --> 00:05:21,643
Not funny.

45
00:05:21,723 --> 00:05:22,343
Hey.

46
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:25,104
Ok, sorry, this is not a vacation.

47
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:27,260
Ok, this is a business retreat.

48
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,446
So we're gonna be all business
for the next two days.

49
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:30,920
Sorry.

50
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:32,445
I love you,

51
00:05:32,469 --> 00:05:34,464
but doesn't change
the fact you're still an intern.

52
00:05:39,586 --> 00:05:41,037
But at 12:30 curfew tonight,

53
00:05:41,061 --> 00:05:42,108
you should plan on breaking that.

54
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:42,692
Why?

55
00:05:43,222 --> 00:05:43,998
For the...

56
00:05:44,248 --> 00:05:45,952
naked team-building.

57
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,251
Hey, Olivia.

58
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:05,931
Don't forget these.

59
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:07,564
Oh, yeah.

60
00:06:07,861 --> 00:06:09,211
I keep trying to.

61
00:06:10,284 --> 00:06:12,304
I like it. it's very Lisa Loeb.

62
00:06:12,944 --> 00:06:14,049
Oh, well, you know...

63
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,072
I'd rather be very...

64
00:06:16,367 --> 00:06:17,393
Olivia.

65
00:06:18,358 --> 00:06:20,207
We got a gig on Sunday.

66
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:21,397
Yeah, I'll be there.

67
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:24,971
Morning, Peter.

68
00:06:25,397 --> 00:06:26,502
Looking good.
Hi.

69
00:06:27,518 --> 00:06:28,376
Olivia.

70
00:06:28,978 --> 00:06:30,625
Have you slept
with every hipster in town yet?

71
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:33,401
Candice. Do you actually get paid
for this internship

72
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:35,219
or does Daddy just increase your allowance?

73
00:06:36,179 --> 00:06:38,399
You know, if you wanna get rid of that
baby fat,

74
00:06:38,424 --> 00:06:39,904
you should try the gym.

75
00:06:40,586 --> 00:06:42,615
They have these workout machines
that you use on your back.

76
00:06:42,912 --> 00:06:43,847
You're good at that.

77
00:06:43,872 --> 00:06:45,795
Sweetie, it's not fat.

78
00:06:48,089 --> 00:06:49,287
They're called tits.

79
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:55,139
You're not looking so hot there,
Moll face.

80
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:56,652
Gee, thanks.

81
00:06:57,379 --> 00:06:59,832
Hey, did you try the little jam bread whatever
your boyfriend made?

82
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,356
I got a tell you, he's a pre...

83
00:07:01,582 --> 00:07:03,423
Oh that's what it is, is it?
Did I touch a nerve?

84
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,134
Just leave me alone, Isaac.
Hey, Moll?

85
00:07:05,667 --> 00:07:06,535
Moll? Look at me.

86
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:07,457
Look at me. Hey.

87
00:07:07,622 --> 00:07:09,096
If you ever need anyone to talk to...

88
00:07:09,592 --> 00:07:12,427
I'm told. I'm a really really good listener
by a lot of ladies, wait, don't say anything.

89
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:13,849
Tell me this is Kimber
from last Tuesday.

90
00:07:14,777 --> 00:07:15,660
Wait, I'm sorry, which Kimber...

91
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,244
Hey, let's sit next
to each other on the bus.

92
00:07:17,297 --> 00:07:18,593
No, no, I remember you.

93
00:07:18,617 --> 00:07:19,876
You like a bigger gal right?

94
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:21,158
You know what you should do?

95
00:07:21,321 --> 00:07:22,667
What?
You should apologize.

96
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,098
Why?

97
00:07:24,122 --> 00:07:25,032
Doesn't matter.

98
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:26,309
Never matters.
She is just...

99
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:27,888
I'm sorry, because I...

100
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,373
Oh, shit.

101
00:07:37,806 --> 00:07:39,213
Hey, Stan, how's it going?

102
00:07:39,989 --> 00:07:41,466
It's Sam, sir.

103
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,220
Did you just correct me?

104
00:07:45,326 --> 00:07:46,100
No.

105
00:07:46,891 --> 00:07:47,740
Look at me.

106
00:07:47,765 --> 00:07:48,817
Yeah.
What's my name?

107
00:07:49,184 --> 00:07:50,291
Dennis.
Look away.

108
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:52,271
All set, Pete?

109
00:07:52,543 --> 00:07:54,933
Yes, yes sir.
Yeah, we're just waiting on Nathan.

110
00:07:55,236 --> 00:07:57,443
What's the one thing
we can't recycle, Pete?

111
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:59,028
Wasted time, sir.

112
00:07:59,055 --> 00:07:59,849
Exactly.

113
00:08:00,049 --> 00:08:01,950
I wanna be on the road in 90 seconds.

114
00:08:02,989 --> 00:08:05,289
Well, I just saw his car,
so I'll go track him down.

115
00:08:05,314 --> 00:08:07,130
Way to show some initiative, Stan.

116
00:08:08,052 --> 00:08:09,232
It's gonna be a good day.

117
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,039
Hey, guys.
Hey, man.

118
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:15,212
What's up, bud?

119
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,621
Why you riding Nate so hard, man?

120
00:08:25,622 --> 00:08:27,592
Yeah, I'm just trying
to make sense of it here.

121
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,413
Three weeks ago they brought you
in as assistant plant manager

122
00:08:30,461 --> 00:08:31,754
and now you got a day off?

123
00:08:32,454 --> 00:08:33,501
It's not a day off.

124
00:08:33,525 --> 00:08:35,211
It's a re, It's a re...

125
00:08:35,236 --> 00:08:36,829
Re, Re-what? Retarded?

126
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,390
It's a retreat.

127
00:08:38,876 --> 00:08:39,996
It's a retreat.

128
00:08:40,256 --> 00:08:41,551
How many are gonna go, boy?

129
00:08:41,575 --> 00:08:42,496
Ok! I'm just following orders.

130
00:08:42,521 --> 00:08:44,188
So if you don't like it then you can..
I can what?

131
00:08:44,556 --> 00:08:45,637
What? I can what?

132
00:08:45,655 --> 00:08:47,724
Nathan? Hey! Come on man!
We're all waiting for you.

133
00:08:49,176 --> 00:08:50,924
Yeah. Ok.
Now, hold on!

134
00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:53,215
Hold on! What are you going to say?
What are you going to say?

135
00:08:53,842 --> 00:08:55,862
I got at least 15 years on you here!

136
00:08:56,229 --> 00:08:58,460
You got what, 4 years
in some classroom upstate?

137
00:08:58,461 --> 00:08:59,903
Listen, man?
If you think I'm gonna sit here...

138
00:08:59,928 --> 00:09:01,191
Not a good idea, Roy!

139
00:09:01,216 --> 00:09:02,360
Not a good idea, man!

140
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,381
We're fine for the day.

141
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,592
Why do you let him get away with that?

142
00:09:10,665 --> 00:09:12,444
No choice. He's the union rep.

143
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:15,564
I fire him and suddenly
I've got a factory full of Roys.

144
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,669
But I'll win him over, even if it kills me.

145
00:09:19,149 --> 00:09:19,935
What about you?

146
00:09:20,329 --> 00:09:22,436
When are they gonna offer you
that permanent gig at the restaurant?

147
00:09:22,859 --> 00:09:23,801
They already did.

148
00:09:24,023 --> 00:09:25,256
Dude, that's great.

149
00:09:25,491 --> 00:09:27,297
I don't know man, I mean...

150
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:30,329
they wanna send me
to the flagship restaurant in Paris...

151
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:31,225
for who knows how long?

152
00:09:31,249 --> 00:09:32,911
Could be six months, could be a year.

153
00:09:33,305 --> 00:09:35,158
I just thought
I'd be leaving too much behind.

154
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,392
Although now I'm not so sure.

155
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,986
Well look, if you...

156
00:09:43,107 --> 00:09:44,113
if you do go to Paris,

157
00:09:44,412 --> 00:09:45,359
do me a favor.

158
00:09:45,526 --> 00:09:46,279
What's that?

159
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,132
Take Roy with you.

160
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:49,613
Hell, no.

161
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,114
Hey, Sam.

162
00:10:02,373 --> 00:10:03,177
You coming?

163
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:04,367
Yeah.

164
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:11,037
<i>Get ready for a new adventure,</i>

165
00:10:11,162 --> 00:10:13,616
<i>at 180 Corporate Consulting.</i>

166
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,311

What are those for?

172
00:10:30,194 --> 00:10:30,785
It's...

173
00:10:31,288 --> 00:10:32,808
just something I do to relax me,

174
00:10:33,287 --> 00:10:34,641

Hey Katrina, how you doing?

178
00:10:45,992 --> 00:10:49,108
No, just this stupid retreat thing
with the idiots from the office.

179
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,448
No, no, no, not you, sir. Them.

180
00:10:53,199 --> 00:10:55,279
Hold on a sec, let me go someplace
a little more private.

181
00:10:56,337 --> 00:10:57,493
Bald's the new black, sir.

182
00:10:57,518 --> 00:10:58,679
Bald's the new black.

183
00:10:59,475 --> 00:11:02,728
Yeah no, hang on a sec babe. Just
gonna head on back to my private office.

184
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,113
Damn it.

191
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:06,232
Peter, did you feel that?

192
00:13:06,569 --> 00:13:07,381
What?

193
00:13:09,131 --> 00:13:10,151

Oh, Shit!

Over here! See the railing?

213
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:50,628
You can do this.

Alright.
Olivia, come on.

229
00:15:29,934 --> 00:15:32,741

gotta follow this to Molly's voice, alright?

287
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:38,602
Get off the bus!
Holy shit!

288
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:40,229

How did you know?

293
00:20:33,574 --> 00:20:35,292
It says right here in your statement

294
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,514
I saw it collapse.

295
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:38,285
I knew it would happen.

296
00:20:39,102 --> 00:20:40,695
That sounds premeditated to me.

No, no, no. That's not what I meant.

298

I had...

299
00:20:46,025 --> 00:20:47,157
had a vision.

300
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:48,735
Ok.

301
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:49,777
A vision.

302
00:20:50,595 --> 00:20:51,738
Psychic phenomena,

303
00:20:52,204 --> 00:20:53,644

304
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,637
You actually believe in that stuff?

305
00:20:56,042 --> 00:20:57,089
I don't know.

306
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:00,784
I'll tell you what I believe

307
00:21:01,555 --> 00:21:03,432
There's an answer for everything.

308
00:21:03,602 --> 00:21:04,668
Which mean there's an answer,

309
00:21:04,692 --> 00:21:07,504
for why you knew to warn everyone
the bridge was going to collapse,

310
00:21:07,742 --> 00:21:08,755
and minutes later...

311
00:21:08,912 --> 00:21:09,785
it did.

312
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,592
I told you, I saw it coming.

313
00:21:11,946 --> 00:21:13,159
I don't know how.

314
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,259
I just did.

315
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:18,706
And no one else did?

316
00:21:19,627 --> 00:21:20,559
Like I said it just...

317
00:21:21,827 --> 00:21:23,020
came out of nowhere.

318
00:21:23,297 --> 00:21:24,890
Did Sam have issues with authority?

319
00:21:24,915 --> 00:21:26,899
Did he ever demonstrate any sort of...

320
00:21:27,521 --> 00:21:28,670
extremist behavior?

321
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:29,828
No.

322
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:33,416
Wait. Extremist behavior?

323
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:36,110
You mean like a terrorist?

324
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:39,976
You see him talk to anyone that morning?
On a cell phone, pay phone?

325
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:41,736
Just his girlfriend.

326
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,907
His ex-girlfriend, I mean. Molly.

327
00:21:45,746 --> 00:21:47,127
But that was in person.

328
00:21:47,751 --> 00:21:48,367
Molly.

329
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:50,494
Ex.

330
00:21:51,121 --> 00:21:52,408
Tell me about the breakup.

331
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:53,592
Was he upset?

332
00:21:54,128 --> 00:21:55,841
Scale of 1 to 10.

333
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:58,474
It's personal.

334
00:22:00,203 --> 00:22:01,808
You must have been pissed, right?

335
00:22:01,832 --> 00:22:03,267
Getting dumped like that.

336
00:22:04,106 --> 00:22:05,819
What does that have to do
with anything?

337
00:22:06,355 --> 00:22:08,819
I'm just trying to get all the pieces
of the puzzle together...

338
00:22:08,844 --> 00:22:10,734
before I start moving them around,

339
00:22:10,837 --> 00:22:12,097
making them fit.

340
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,446
Look, I just had a hunch,

341
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:16,114
that something bad was gonna happen.

342
00:22:16,783 --> 00:22:17,450
That's it.

343
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:21,142
Excuse me.

344
00:22:25,213 --> 00:22:27,215
Forensics came back with the analysis.

345
00:22:28,075 --> 00:22:28,723
And?

346
00:22:28,976 --> 00:22:32,108
They're chalking it up to high winds and
structural damage from the construction.

347
00:22:32,367 --> 00:22:33,449
High winds?

348
00:22:33,828 --> 00:22:35,527
Yeah. Send everyone home.

349
00:22:37,772 --> 00:22:38,773
You're free to go.

350
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:47,884
I have a feeling
we'll be seeing each other again.

351
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:49,596
Call it a hunch.

352
00:22:57,317 --> 00:23:02,368
<i>Authorities are calling the North Bay
Bridge collapse a freak act of nature</i>

353
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:07,140
<i>citing a highway improvement project
that may have weakened the superstructure.</i>

354
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:11,274
<i>Among the survivors were eight employees
of Presage Paper</i>

355
00:23:11,378 --> 00:23:13,426
<i>on their way to a business retreat.</i>

356
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:16,987
The other 17 employees
were killed in the collapse.

357
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:19,990
And although they've been branded
the lucky eight

358
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:24,279
the surviving employees
now face an uncertain future.

359
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:45,348
Hey, guys.

360
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:46,291
Hey.

361
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,504
Hey.

362
00:23:49,464 --> 00:23:50,876
Anybody know when this...

363
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,030
thing's supposed to start?

364
00:23:52,981 --> 00:23:54,296
When Dennis gets here,

365
00:23:54,487 --> 00:23:55,350
I guess.

366
00:23:58,091 --> 00:23:59,477
That agent still hounding you?

367
00:24:00,275 --> 00:24:00,927
No.

368
00:24:00,951 --> 00:24:01,970
You heard the news,

369
00:24:02,264 --> 00:24:03,797
it was natural causes.

370
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:06,654
Yeah, more like supernatural.

371
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:09,311
How you holding up?

372
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,916
I tried calling.

373
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:12,606
No, no, yeah, I saw...

374
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:13,357
I was...

375
00:24:13,874 --> 00:24:14,913
I was just tired...

376
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:17,190
So?

377
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:20,499
How did you explain it?

378
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:24,946
I didn't.

379
00:24:26,713 --> 00:24:27,566
I couldn't.

380
00:24:27,597 --> 00:24:29,239
Sam, there had to be a reason.

381
00:24:29,631 --> 00:24:31,833
Hey. That is exactly
what the agent kept saying.

382
00:24:36,103 --> 00:24:37,672
Whatever answer you're looking for,

383
00:24:38,236 --> 00:24:39,629
I don't have it.

384
00:24:39,943 --> 00:24:42,072
Yeah, Sam's right.
It doesn't matter how it happened.

385
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:44,911
We should all just put it behind us
and be grateful we're still alive.

386
00:24:48,668 --> 00:24:50,355
Definitely beats the alternative, right?

387
00:24:51,249 --> 00:24:52,961
I look out at the faces today,

388
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,661
and I see family members,

389
00:24:55,922 --> 00:24:56,412
friends.

390
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:00,445
But the people that left us
on the bridge that day,

391
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:02,130
they were more than that.

392
00:25:02,803 --> 00:25:04,546
People like Jennifer Alcott,

393
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:08,110
Chris Boylan,

394
00:25:10,234 --> 00:25:11,360
David Buckler.

395
00:25:12,717 --> 00:25:14,157
Maybe you worked next to them.

396
00:25:14,855 --> 00:25:16,237
Maybe you worked for them.

397
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:18,243
But we all worked with them.

398
00:25:20,695 --> 00:25:23,335
Who can forget, Trevor Wino's smile?

399
00:25:26,295 --> 00:25:27,595
Or Isaac Palmer.

400
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:30,029
Did he just say my name?

401
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:32,644
That's not funny.

402
00:25:32,668 --> 00:25:33,487
I know, I'm sorry.

403
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,774
I just get weird with tragedies. I'm sorry.

404
00:25:38,933 --> 00:25:40,426
I see dead people.

405
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:42,552
Guys.

406
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:53,305
Death...

407
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:57,648
doesn't like to be cheated.

408
00:25:58,307 --> 00:25:59,303
Excuse me?

409
00:25:59,954 --> 00:26:01,183
What's that supposed to mean?

410
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:08,215
You all just be careful now.

411
00:26:09,264 --> 00:26:11,041
Ok. Thanks for the advice!

412
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:13,488
Creepy guy.

413
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:38,084
How's that foie gras, Sam?

414
00:26:38,108 --> 00:26:39,234
Waiting on you pal.

415
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,247
Thanks.

416
00:26:59,275 --> 00:27:00,295
Got my dessert?

417
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:10,049
Whats the matter with it?

418
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:12,284
Said it was flat. No flavor.

419
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:15,597
Do they want something else?
Yeah.

420
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:16,543
The check.

421
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:21,070
Let me taste it.

422
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:28,885
The customer is an asshole.

423
00:27:28,909 --> 00:27:30,160
The bourguignon is good.

424
00:27:42,953 --> 00:27:43,908
Hold on.

425
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:58,810
You mind if I come in?

426
00:27:59,242 --> 00:28:00,500
Yeah. Sure.

427
00:28:10,997 --> 00:28:11,797
Thanks.

428
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:13,850
I thought you'd be working tonight.

429
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:14,639
Yeah.

430
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:16,433
You know,
I worked the first shift,

431
00:28:16,457 --> 00:28:17,210
but...

432
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:20,171
there was something else I needed to do.

433
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:27,590
Can I...

434
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:30,083
Yeah. Sure, go ahead.

435
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,593
Thank you.

436
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:28,226
Listen...

437
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:32,149
When everything started going down
on that bridge...

438
00:29:36,097 --> 00:29:38,224
the only thing I thought about
was you.

439
00:29:39,976 --> 00:29:41,543
Getting you to safety.

440
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:44,062
You are the only thing,

441
00:29:44,379 --> 00:29:45,749
I care about, Molly.

442
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:49,984
Whatever's wrong,

443
00:29:50,423 --> 00:29:51,668
I can fix it.

444
00:29:51,693 --> 00:29:53,229
You haven't done anything wrong.

445
00:29:55,185 --> 00:29:56,989
Then, what? What is it?

446
00:29:58,780 --> 00:29:59,594
Paris.

447
00:30:00,023 --> 00:30:01,327
We talked about that.

448
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:03,456
I'm not going to uproot my life,

449
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,583
leave you,

450
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:06,716
for that job.

451
00:30:06,741 --> 00:30:08,860
But it's the only thing
you've ever dreamed of.

452
00:30:11,852 --> 00:30:13,775
Life is too short, Sam is...

453
00:30:14,057 --> 00:30:16,085
You have to go after what you love.

454
00:30:17,551 --> 00:30:18,318
I am.

455
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:24,956
You should take the job.

456
00:30:27,183 --> 00:30:29,223
Go to Paris.

457
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:47,226
Hey.
Hey.

458
00:30:47,783 --> 00:30:48,667
What's the matter?

459
00:30:49,735 --> 00:30:52,273
I don't know. I'm just not ready.
I don't feel ready.

460
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:56,073
It's been really hard to concentrate
after everything.

461
00:30:57,491 --> 00:30:58,788
Yeah? Are you sure?

462
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:00,213
Yeah.

463
00:31:00,901 --> 00:31:03,241
Because this is the last practice
before the championship.

464
00:31:04,412 --> 00:31:06,487
And it's your last practice
of your college career.

465
00:31:06,512 --> 00:31:07,667
I know but...

466
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:11,117
I think you got this.

467
00:31:13,576 --> 00:31:14,360
Really?

468
00:31:14,384 --> 00:31:15,197
Yeah.

469
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:17,457
I mean you love it out there.

470
00:31:19,841 --> 00:31:20,533
Ok.

471
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:21,585
You're right.

472
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:23,682
And besides, coach would kill me.

473
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:24,707
Yeah.

474
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:26,320
Here.

475
00:31:28,762 --> 00:31:29,634
Thanks.

476
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:31,360
Come here.

477
00:31:34,184 --> 00:31:35,080
Bye.

478
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,220
You got this.

479
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:51,536
You have to get a little more speed.
You gotta hit that follow-up.

480
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:58,514
I'm sore from the back extensions.
Really?

481
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:06,679
Ok, seriously this is stupid.

482
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:09,032
They've gotta make it cooler
or we're gonna pass out.

483
00:32:09,712 --> 00:32:11,058
They're working on it.

484
00:32:11,221 --> 00:32:13,187
Well, they should have it fixed by now.

485
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:38,608
Come on, Candice. You're up.

486
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,123
Come on, Candice.

487
00:32:50,653 --> 00:32:51,521
You got this.

488
00:33:17,303 --> 00:33:18,192
Candice.

489
00:33:18,315 --> 00:33:19,432
Now.

490
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,511
Really strong value on this.

491
00:33:41,037 --> 00:33:42,490
Hey, coach! How was that?

492
00:34:02,725 --> 00:34:05,485
I wanna see you guys run the routine
all the way through once.

493
00:34:24,093 --> 00:34:24,940
That's good.

494
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:27,040
Alright, Janine next. Let's go.

495
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:29,133
Let's go ladies and drink water.

496
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:35,669
That's it.

497
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:37,402
Every time, Candice.

498
00:34:43,026 --> 00:34:44,393
There you go.
Thanks.

499
00:34:45,365 --> 00:34:46,779
Nicely done Candice.

500
00:34:51,921 --> 00:34:53,621
Ok, go to bars.

501
00:34:53,937 --> 00:34:55,501
Come on. Hit the floor. You can do it.

502
00:34:58,388 --> 00:34:59,874
Go hard this time, Candice.

503
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:02,408
Let's be aggressive.

504
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,261
Here we go, Candice.

505
00:35:05,786 --> 00:35:06,767
Stay loose.

506
00:35:07,999 --> 00:35:09,493
Ok, Porter, it's your turn.

507
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:12,700
Stay focused.

508
00:35:14,064 --> 00:35:14,850
Good.

509
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:22,991
Looking good Candice.

510
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:07,416
Candice? Candice?

511
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:09,880
Oh, what happened?
Don't touch her.

512
00:36:09,905 --> 00:36:11,402
Someone call 911.

513
00:36:11,506 --> 00:36:13,066
Oh my Gosh.
Candice?

514
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:35,185
Peter.

515
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:51,815
I came as soon as I heard.

516
00:36:55,959 --> 00:36:57,175
She was doing great.

517
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:02,641
She was almost finished
with her routine and then...

518
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:12,180
Why did it happen?

519
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:17,100
This doesn't make any sense.

520
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:19,145
I don't know, man.

521
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:23,896
I'm sorry.

522
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,292
I'm so sorry, Peter.

523
00:37:38,721 --> 00:37:40,421
Let's just go, Sam.

524
00:37:55,315 --> 00:37:55,981
Hey.

525
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:58,275
How's it going?

526
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:00,995
It's weird.

527
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:04,033
Being here, I mean.

528
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:08,067
It's just so quiet.

529
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:12,618
Yeah, well, Dennis had all the calls
rerouted to corporate.

530
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:14,711
Yeah, well...

531
00:38:15,632 --> 00:38:16,705
it's depressing.

532
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:23,351
Holy crap. Did you guys
get your bereavement pay yet?

533
00:38:28,127 --> 00:38:29,253
Hey, what's he doing here?

534
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:32,397
I think he just needed the distraction.

535
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,414
Yeah.

536
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,902
Yeah, that's a bummer about Candice.

537
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:39,665
Guess we all should have seen
that coming.

538
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:43,472
What?

539
00:38:44,174 --> 00:38:47,865
You see the crazy shit those gymnasts do.
I'm surprised it doesn't happen more often.

540
00:38:49,244 --> 00:38:50,609
<i>Once you've handled the e-mail</i>

541
00:38:50,784 --> 00:38:54,236
<i>you'll need to deactivate all the key cards
of the deceased employees.</i>

542
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,251
<i>Instructions are in your binder.</i>

543
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:59,162
Well, shouldn't that be the job
of the facility manager?

544
00:39:00,521 --> 00:39:02,055
<i>The facility manager's dead.</i>

545
00:39:04,628 --> 00:39:06,427
<i>Dennis, you want me to fly
someone up there?</i>

546
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:07,588
No, no, I got it.

547
00:39:15,718 --> 00:39:16,771
Debbie.

548
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:24,557
You were so naughty.

549
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:39,759
Fuck it.

550
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:48,671
Robert, my man.

551
00:40:02,649 --> 00:40:03,338
Shit.

552
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:12,064
You shouldn't have, buddy.

553
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,590
Hey, man, what are you doing up here?

554
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:28,728
Had to get off the factory floor, man.
Roy's driving me crazy.

555
00:40:30,004 --> 00:40:30,868
So...

556
00:40:31,681 --> 00:40:32,401
who wants one?

557
00:40:33,074 --> 00:40:34,115
Where'd you get these?

558
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:34,795
I stole it,

559
00:40:34,819 --> 00:40:35,838
out of Roy's truck.

560
00:40:36,565 --> 00:40:37,370
It's good, right?

561
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:39,599
I got something better.

562
00:40:40,963 --> 00:40:41,985
Nice one.

563
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:43,448
Yeah, count me in.

564
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:46,028
Are you sure you wanna share that?

565
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:48,851
If I don't, I'll end up drinking it alone,
which is...

566
00:40:48,875 --> 00:40:49,357
just...

567
00:40:49,793 --> 00:40:50,538
sad.

568
00:40:52,006 --> 00:40:54,134
Well, this day just got way more fun.

569
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:09,114
No, I did call you.

570
00:41:09,809 --> 00:41:10,994
Of course. I just...

571
00:41:11,189 --> 00:41:12,767
called you right now, didn't I?

572
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:15,900
Because I really do
wanna take you out again.

573
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:17,880
Yeah, yeah, we'll do like a nice...

574
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:19,682
romantic dinner.

575
00:41:19,707 --> 00:41:20,591
You know, somewhere maybe...

576
00:41:21,171 --> 00:41:22,351
outside the city.

577
00:41:22,376 --> 00:41:23,091
Hold up.

578
00:41:26,669 --> 00:41:27,723
You know what?

579
00:41:28,005 --> 00:41:28,922
I gotta go.

580
00:41:29,392 --> 00:41:31,368
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I'm not blowing you off.

581
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:32,311
Hey, listen.

582
00:41:32,335 --> 00:41:34,111
Hey, who's my girl Kimber?

583
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:37,464
Amber yes, that's what I said.

584
00:41:37,706 --> 00:41:38,615
Excuse me.

585
00:41:44,436 --> 00:41:45,241
Amber?

586
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:48,542
Amber I'm sorry wait, wait a second.
Is that weird sound on your end or mi...

587
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,402
Sorry about that.

588
00:41:50,955 --> 00:41:52,456
My, sister...

589
00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:54,241
tends to get a little chatty sometimes.

590
00:41:56,431 --> 00:41:57,211
So...

591
00:41:57,621 --> 00:42:00,685
tell me about stress relief.

592
00:42:00,772 --> 00:42:01,966
And what does this...

593
00:42:02,758 --> 00:42:04,045
really get me?

594
00:42:04,503 --> 00:42:07,222
This covers a session
for two different physical therapies.

595
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:07,930
Like...

596
00:42:07,954 --> 00:42:09,573
massage therapy?

597
00:42:10,403 --> 00:42:12,288
Erotic massage?

598
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:15,688
This is a family operation.

599
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,035
Everyone on staff is professional.

600
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:20,276
Hey, that's great. I prefer a professional.

601
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,881
In fact, you know what?
I kind of demand it.

602
00:42:21,987 --> 00:42:23,362
I'm just trying to clarify though that,

603
00:42:23,386 --> 00:42:26,810
this professional experience ends...

604
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:30,798
happy.

605
00:42:34,091 --> 00:42:36,093
I know exactly what you need.

606
00:42:36,121 --> 00:42:37,587
Oh, I'm sure you do.

607
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:40,167
Follow me, please.
I'd love to.

608
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:43,423
Slow down there a little bit.

609
00:42:44,042 --> 00:42:44,800
Yeah.

610
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:46,941
Yeah, you have a lovely little Canter.

611
00:42:50,777 --> 00:42:52,950
Yum yum, dim sum.

612
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:54,417
Hold up there a second.

613
00:42:54,789 --> 00:42:56,910
Alright, these are solid.
Just making sure.

614
00:42:57,362 --> 00:42:59,535
Tend to be a bit noisy,
if you know what I mean.

615
00:43:04,697 --> 00:43:05,738
Yo, Buddha.

616
00:43:06,109 --> 00:43:07,684
Slow down on the rice cakes.

617
00:43:12,267 --> 00:43:13,790
Just close your eyes.

618
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:15,085
Relax.

619
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:17,374
And someone will be in to...

620
00:43:17,398 --> 00:43:18,697
service you soon.

621
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:21,395
Oh, yeah.

622
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:35,882
Oh, yeah.

623
00:43:36,823 --> 00:43:37,986
Feels dynamite.

624
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:39,063
No, no.

625
00:43:39,733 --> 00:43:41,779
You're going the wrong way there,
little lady.

626
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:43,747
I didn't make a mistake.

627
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:49,628
Wait a second, what happened
to the younger version of you?

628
00:43:50,191 --> 00:43:51,751
Let's start now.

629
00:43:51,984 --> 00:43:53,559
Do you think I'm too old.

630
00:43:53,584 --> 00:43:56,097
Ok, I'm sorry.
Do you come with subtitles?

631
00:43:57,152 --> 00:43:58,972
Ok, maybe I should go here.

632
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:01,043
Don't know what that means.

633
00:44:01,067 --> 00:44:02,279
No idea. Yep.

634
00:44:04,487 --> 00:44:05,172
Fuck!

635
00:44:07,325 --> 00:44:09,438
No, no, that's ok.
That's ok, I'm alright.

636
00:44:10,419 --> 00:44:11,725
Holy shit, you're strong.

637
00:44:12,218 --> 00:44:13,337
Hey. What are you doing?

638
00:44:14,402 --> 00:44:16,038
You're a little aggressive there.
Don't you think?

639
00:44:17,087 --> 00:44:18,544
What's capay?
I don't know what that means.

640
00:44:19,174 --> 00:44:21,008
I don't want a foo-hay. No foo-hay.

641
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:28,250
Cheers.

642
00:44:37,967 --> 00:44:39,139
Shit, that's my ride.

643
00:44:39,164 --> 00:44:40,642
Shit. I gotta go.

644
00:44:41,304 --> 00:44:42,535
Leaving more for us.

645
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:53,233
Alright, well, more for me.

646
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:54,525
Alright, bye.

647
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:56,075
See you later.
Ok.

648
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:56,726
Later.

649
00:44:57,403 --> 00:44:58,600
This is...

650
00:44:59,093 --> 00:45:00,873
the end, so, what are we toasting to?

651
00:45:00,918 --> 00:45:02,716
To, finding new jobs.

652
00:45:02,992 --> 00:45:05,370
Because it's only a matter of time
before they shut us down.

653
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:06,442
Hear, hear.

654
00:45:06,626 --> 00:45:08,370
To starting over.

655
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:13,449
Peter?

656
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:19,396
It just doesn't make sense.

657
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:22,016
She dies doing something
that she's done...

658
00:45:22,799 --> 00:45:25,723
almost every day
for the last 15 years of her life.

659
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,449
She said she didn't wanna do it.

660
00:45:28,983 --> 00:45:30,939
She said she wasn't ready.

661
00:45:34,256 --> 00:45:35,779
And I should have stopped her.

662
00:45:37,334 --> 00:45:39,086
I should have done something.
I should've...

663
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:41,170
Peter, there wasn't anything
you could've done.

664
00:45:44,075 --> 00:45:45,157
How do you know?

665
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:52,481
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

666
00:46:02,093 --> 00:46:03,457
Hello, Agent Block?

667
00:46:03,939 --> 00:46:05,206
This is Dennis.

668
00:46:06,226 --> 00:46:09,473
Yeah, Peter just freaked out
about something, I don't know what.

669
00:46:10,492 --> 00:46:11,744
Does that mean anything?

670
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:14,192
<i>You told me to call if I saw anything odd.</i>

671
00:46:14,355 --> 00:46:16,804
I don't know yet, but thank you Dennis and,

672
00:46:17,058 --> 00:46:19,068
call me if you see anything strange.

673
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:21,128
Stranger.

674
00:46:21,865 --> 00:46:22,851
Should we...

675
00:46:23,492 --> 00:46:25,865
maybe have code names
for one another, do you think?

676
00:46:27,989 --> 00:46:28,995
Over and out.

677
00:46:30,745 --> 00:46:32,629
Alright, show me how this happened.

678
00:46:35,101 --> 00:46:36,227
I don't think I can.

679
00:46:36,252 --> 00:46:37,259
What do you mean?

680
00:46:38,004 --> 00:46:40,577
I mean, I could try it a hundred times

681
00:46:40,601 --> 00:46:42,759
and never re-create exactly
what happened here.

682
00:46:45,011 --> 00:46:46,558
This is some freaky shit.

683
00:46:57,783 --> 00:46:58,436
God!

684
00:47:03,404 --> 00:47:05,202
Oh, that actually felt great.

685
00:47:08,177 --> 00:47:09,590
Yeah. Awesome.

686
00:47:15,124 --> 00:47:17,477
Wait. Are those things even sterilized?

687
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:20,064
No, no, no. I'm not catching any diseases,

688
00:47:20,224 --> 00:47:21,263
unless I've earned them.

689
00:47:29,055 --> 00:47:30,043
Wait a second.

690
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:31,994
You understood that.

691
00:47:32,725 --> 00:47:34,693
You speak English.

692
00:47:45,470 --> 00:47:46,504
Alright, you know what?

693
00:47:46,978 --> 00:47:47,895
Let's do this.

694
00:47:48,398 --> 00:47:50,336
Two billion people can't be Wong.

695
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:52,024
I said Wong.

696
00:47:52,048 --> 00:47:53,079
You follow me?

697
00:47:53,384 --> 00:47:54,727
You get it, you're Chinese.

698
00:47:58,813 --> 00:48:01,908
Ok, it's in. it's definitely in.
Ok, yes, it is in.

699
00:48:03,397 --> 00:48:04,754
How many of these are you gonna
put in me?

700
00:48:18,143 --> 00:48:20,052
Hey, can you... can you grab that for me?

701
00:48:20,729 --> 00:48:21,529
Thanks.

702
00:48:23,711 --> 00:48:24,556
Hey.

703
00:48:27,519 --> 00:48:28,944
That's not very nice, you know.

704
00:48:42,293 --> 00:48:44,170
Ok, your thumbs are kind of
in my eyes.

705
00:48:44,223 --> 00:48:46,317
DDDDDDDDDDDD
I'm not gonna lie, it's a little annoying.

706
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:49,637
Ok, once again Chinese lady,
I don't have a clue what you're saying.

707
00:48:49,704 --> 00:48:50,624
Not have a little clue.

708
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:52,459
Thirty minutes.

709
00:48:53,109 --> 00:48:54,177
You sleep.

710
00:49:05,443 --> 00:49:06,396
Sleep.

711
00:49:36,265 --> 00:49:38,325
Hey! Fire!

712
00:49:39,578 --> 00:49:40,598
Hello?

713
00:49:42,111 --> 00:49:42,944
Hey!

714
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:45,265
Hey! Hey!

715
00:49:45,733 --> 00:49:48,111
Hey, there's a fire in here!

716
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:50,196
Hey, there's a fire!

717
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:52,282
Get in here!

718
00:50:55,448 --> 00:50:56,081
Oh, shit.

719
00:51:16,991 --> 00:51:18,184
You should come with me.

720
00:51:19,368 --> 00:51:20,324
To Paris?

721
00:51:20,349 --> 00:51:21,858
Yeah, you know, you said it yourself.

722
00:51:22,175 --> 00:51:23,895
Like, you're gonna have to start over.

723
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,122
Start over with me.

724
00:51:29,712 --> 00:51:31,555
How many drinks have you had?

725
00:51:31,714 --> 00:51:32,387
Enough.

726
00:51:32,752 --> 00:51:33,412
Molly,

727
00:51:33,727 --> 00:51:34,684
I'm serious.

728
00:51:34,721 --> 00:51:35,622
Look, you were right.

729
00:51:36,326 --> 00:51:38,240
If I don't take the job, I'll regret it.

730
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:42,232
But I'm not willing to lose you.

731
00:51:42,391 --> 00:51:44,499
Why does it have to be one or the other?

732
00:51:45,765 --> 00:51:47,392
I'm better when you're with me.

733
00:51:49,802 --> 00:51:51,597
Guys, you're not gonna believe this.

734
00:52:05,716 --> 00:52:07,309
They're saying it was a freak accident.

735
00:52:07,334 --> 00:52:09,049
Yeah, raise your hand
if you believe that.

736
00:52:09,553 --> 00:52:11,324
Who dies during a massage?

737
00:52:11,348 --> 00:52:12,727
Seriously.

738
00:52:13,047 --> 00:52:15,095
First Candice, now Isaac.

739
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:16,821
It can't be a coincidence.

740
00:52:17,301 --> 00:52:18,522
It's not.

741
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:20,588
Where are you going?

742
00:52:21,957 --> 00:52:23,217
It's that creepy dude.

743
00:52:24,058 --> 00:52:25,577
Why are you following us?

744
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:28,744
Who are you?

745
00:52:30,189 --> 00:52:33,075
You were at the cemetery,
then the gym, now here.

746
00:52:34,975 --> 00:52:36,002
What are you doing?

747
00:52:36,487 --> 00:52:37,580
My job.

748
00:52:47,456 --> 00:52:48,866
What's happening to us?

749
00:52:53,212 --> 00:52:55,252
What makes you think I know anything?

750
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:56,992
You warned us.

751
00:52:57,466 --> 00:53:00,390
At the memorial service.
You said Death didn't like to be cheated.

752
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:02,375
It's just that I've seen this...

753
00:53:02,839 --> 00:53:03,812
before.

754
00:53:04,331 --> 00:53:05,170
You seen what?

755
00:53:05,257 --> 00:53:07,857
A lucky few survive a disaster.

756
00:53:08,408 --> 00:53:10,842
And then one by one,

757
00:53:11,557 --> 00:53:13,460
Death comes for them all.

758
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:16,953
You changed things on that bridge.

759
00:53:17,344 --> 00:53:19,017
There's a wrinkle in reality.

760
00:53:19,573 --> 00:53:20,936
And that wrinkle...

761
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:22,517
is you.

762
00:53:22,857 --> 00:53:23,647
So what,

763
00:53:24,142 --> 00:53:25,324
we're doomed to die?

764
00:53:25,679 --> 00:53:27,117
I mean, is that it?

765
00:53:27,591 --> 00:53:30,668
We just got our lives back,
so, what kind of fucked up karma is that?

766
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,868
Are you saying we can't stop this?

767
00:53:33,024 --> 00:53:34,955
You were supposed to die on that bridge.

768
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:38,261
You're not supposed to be here.

769
00:53:39,091 --> 00:53:40,457
You shorted Death.

770
00:53:41,093 --> 00:53:43,871
So you let Death have somebody
else in your place

771
00:53:44,124 --> 00:53:45,836
and then you take their spot,

772
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:47,203
in the realm of the living.

773
00:53:47,317 --> 00:53:50,945
All the days and years
that they have yet to live.

774
00:53:51,103 --> 00:53:52,634
And they take your place...

775
00:53:53,149 --> 00:53:54,189
in death.

776
00:53:54,950 --> 00:53:56,543
Then the books are balanced.

777
00:53:56,735 --> 00:53:57,503
Wait a minute.

778
00:53:57,528 --> 00:53:59,202
We kill someone, we get their life?

779
00:54:00,482 --> 00:54:01,642
Is that what you're telling me?

780
00:54:01,755 --> 00:54:03,437
I don't make the rules.

781
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:05,772
I just clean up...

782
00:54:06,355 --> 00:54:07,649
after the game...

783
00:54:08,513 --> 00:54:09,701
is over.

784
00:54:21,341 --> 00:54:22,163
Maybe that's...

785
00:54:22,594 --> 00:54:23,707
why Candice,

786
00:54:23,731 --> 00:54:25,027
and Isaac are dead.

787
00:54:25,554 --> 00:54:27,168
They weren't supposed to survive,

788
00:54:27,271 --> 00:54:28,967
and now it's coming after the rest of us.

789
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:30,393
No.

790
00:54:31,172 --> 00:54:32,321
No, not all of us.

791
00:54:33,729 --> 00:54:35,314
Molly made it, she didn't die.

792
00:54:35,731 --> 00:54:36,554
What?

793
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:39,097
Well, when I had that vision,

794
00:54:39,121 --> 00:54:39,848
or...

795
00:54:40,312 --> 00:54:41,827
premonition, or whatever it was...

796
00:54:43,882 --> 00:54:45,994
I got you across
before the bridge collapsed.

797
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:48,285
You survived.

798
00:54:48,795 --> 00:54:49,773
You saved her?

799
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:52,277
Why, because you...

800
00:54:52,515 --> 00:54:54,889
decided that she deserved to live
more than the rest of us?

801
00:54:54,929 --> 00:54:56,197
No, that's not what he's saying.

802
00:54:56,221 --> 00:54:58,009
I don't deserve to live
more than anyone else.

803
00:54:58,047 --> 00:54:59,420
Apparently you deserved
to live more than Candice.

804
00:54:59,445 --> 00:55:00,754
Hey! Peter, hang on.

805
00:55:00,804 --> 00:55:01,745
Look! Guys.

806
00:55:02,115 --> 00:55:02,755
Come on.

807
00:55:03,615 --> 00:55:05,075
You're not drinking
the coolaid are you?

808
00:55:05,469 --> 00:55:07,935
Killing people to survive Death's list.
Really?

809
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:11,379
I may not know what's going on,

810
00:55:11,403 --> 00:55:13,022
but it's not what that guy's selling.

811
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:14,758
Yeah?

812
00:55:15,329 --> 00:55:16,449
What else is it, then?

813
00:55:21,145 --> 00:55:21,770
Shit.

814
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:24,117
We need to tell Olivia.

815
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:25,570
Come on.

816
00:55:30,535 --> 00:55:31,916
My forms are all signed.

817
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:34,901
I see that it's been quite a while
since your first consultation.

818
00:55:35,541 --> 00:55:37,327
What made you decide
to take the leap today?

819
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:39,716
Well,

820
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:41,741
a lot is going on in my life, and...

821
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:43,161
it's just,

822
00:55:43,958 --> 00:55:45,485
I don't wanna miss anything...

823
00:55:45,903 --> 00:55:47,200
you know, important.

824
00:55:47,439 --> 00:55:49,038
Same reason I had it done myself.

825
00:55:49,430 --> 00:55:51,169
Come on in back.
Let's get you started.

826
00:55:51,736 --> 00:55:52,796
Ok.

827
00:55:59,977 --> 00:56:01,346
Yep, that's the first step.

828
00:56:01,370 --> 00:56:02,947
Yeah.
You'll never need those again.

829
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:07,185
Here we are.

830
00:56:07,549 --> 00:56:08,443
Come on in.

831
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:21,215
What's with these?

832
00:56:22,771 --> 00:56:23,812
Oh, just...

833
00:56:23,984 --> 00:56:25,305
for some of our younger patients.

834
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:27,622
And...

835
00:56:28,019 --> 00:56:29,666
sometimes our older ones too.

836
00:56:29,690 --> 00:56:30,552
Come on.

837
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:42,034
What was that?

838
00:56:42,566 --> 00:56:43,467
Relax.

839
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:46,354
You know, it looks a lot worse
than it really is.

840
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:49,477
Ok, I'm gently going to...

841
00:56:49,501 --> 00:56:50,840
position your head...

842
00:56:53,061 --> 00:56:54,734
and I want you to tell me...

843
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:57,168
when this feels snug.

844
00:56:58,201 --> 00:56:59,301
I can't move my head.

845
00:56:59,625 --> 00:57:00,280
Perfect.

846
00:57:00,921 --> 00:57:01,975
Just what we want.

847
00:57:04,463 --> 00:57:05,449
Here we go.

848
00:57:06,214 --> 00:57:08,204
Ok, now comes the fun part.

849
00:57:09,287 --> 00:57:10,436
Here comes a drop.

850
00:57:10,928 --> 00:57:13,293
And you will feel a little numbness,

851
00:57:13,317 --> 00:57:14,208
in your eye...

852
00:57:14,838 --> 00:57:15,988
which is a good thing.

853
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:33,455
Deep breath.

854
00:57:38,372 --> 00:57:39,794
Relax.

855
00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:47,638
Very good.

856
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:55,365
That a girl.

857
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:05,611
Here.

858
00:58:06,533 --> 00:58:07,680
That's not so bad.

859
00:58:07,704 --> 00:58:08,698
Is it?

860
00:58:21,206 --> 00:58:22,159
Looks good.

861
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:31,955
What was that?

862
00:58:32,224 --> 00:58:33,317
Just relax, Olivia.

863
00:58:33,496 --> 00:58:35,644
I'm just gonna enter some data into...

864
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:40,993
Dottie!

865
00:58:42,686 --> 00:58:43,593
Dot?

866
00:58:44,229 --> 00:58:46,903
Do you know what?
My assistant's given me an incomplete file.

867
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:48,191
I'll be right back.

868
00:58:50,694 --> 00:58:52,205
Hold on, you're leaving?

869
00:59:23,415 --> 00:59:25,361
Is that supposed to be happening?

870
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:07,613
Help me!

871
01:00:19,783 --> 01:00:21,456
Olivia Castle. Where is she?

872
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:22,629
She might be in danger.

873
01:00:23,484 --> 01:00:25,730
She's fine.
We do this kind of procedure all the time.

874
01:00:33,464 --> 01:00:34,798
Help me!

875
01:00:36,216 --> 01:00:37,809
Help me!

876
01:01:02,868 --> 01:01:03,788
Sam.

877
01:01:05,485 --> 01:01:07,034
Stay with me tonight, please.

878
01:01:08,999 --> 01:01:09,925
Of course.

879
01:01:16,032 --> 01:01:18,024
Five different systems had to go wrong...

880
01:01:18,124 --> 01:01:20,498
for that laser to fail us
so spectacularly.

881
01:01:20,522 --> 01:01:21,477
Five.

882
01:01:22,103 --> 01:01:23,524
What do you want from us?

883
01:01:23,889 --> 01:01:26,187
I want you to tell me
what you think is going on.

884
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:27,839
Two deaths? Ok, alright.

885
01:01:27,863 --> 01:01:28,855
That's a coincidence.

886
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:29,841
Three?

887
01:01:30,869 --> 01:01:32,106
That's a pattern.

888
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:46,026
Now...

889
01:01:47,516 --> 01:01:49,535
I know you two didn't do this.

890
01:01:51,105 --> 01:01:51,935
Alright?

891
01:01:53,501 --> 01:01:55,607
But I think you know something.

892
01:01:58,594 --> 01:01:59,561
What is it?

893
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:03,881
We don't know anything.

894
01:02:04,888 --> 01:02:06,814
Take a guess.

895
01:02:13,139 --> 01:02:16,352
We think we weren't supposed
to survive on that bridge.

896
01:02:17,904 --> 01:02:18,951
What?

897
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:20,892
And now something is...

898
01:02:21,422 --> 01:02:22,993
trying to set it right.

899
01:02:25,325 --> 01:02:26,307
Something?

900
01:02:29,073 --> 01:02:30,393
That's all you got?

901
01:02:30,757 --> 01:02:31,974
Right now, yeah.

902
01:02:32,832 --> 01:02:33,738
But if you...

903
01:02:34,601 --> 01:02:36,858
come up with any other explanations,
let us know.

904
01:02:40,479 --> 01:02:41,386
Thank you.

905
01:02:48,515 --> 01:02:49,568
Something.

906
01:02:59,234 --> 01:03:00,027
Hey.

907
01:03:02,557 --> 01:03:03,534
Been up long?

908
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:08,356
I don't know. I couldn't sleep.

909
01:03:08,380 --> 01:03:10,125
I just kept thinking about the bridge.

910
01:03:14,416 --> 01:03:15,322
Sam?

911
01:03:16,362 --> 01:03:17,569
You can't do this to yourself.

912
01:03:17,594 --> 01:03:20,556
No. No, no, no. I was thinking about,
in the premonition...

913
01:03:22,257 --> 01:03:23,579
we all got off the bus,

914
01:03:24,162 --> 01:03:26,397
but the ground gave way
and Candice fell.

915
01:03:27,721 --> 01:03:29,163
Then the bus tipped over.

916
01:03:30,598 --> 01:03:31,504
And Isaac,

917
01:03:31,528 --> 01:03:33,542
he never got off the bus.
He went with it.

918
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:34,962
What are you getting at?

919
01:03:35,353 --> 01:03:36,384
I know that there was...

920
01:03:36,587 --> 01:03:37,953
just so much going on...

921
01:03:39,608 --> 01:03:41,653
Look, I know that I helped you across.

922
01:03:42,902 --> 01:03:44,790
Then I reached back for Olivia.

923
01:03:46,323 --> 01:03:47,843
But she didn't make it. She fell.

924
01:03:51,161 --> 01:03:51,732
So...

925
01:03:53,287 --> 01:03:54,381
first was Candice.

926
01:03:56,750 --> 01:03:57,797
Then Isaac.

927
01:03:59,495 --> 01:04:00,261
Then Olivia.

928
01:04:01,755 --> 01:04:03,355
They're dying in order.

929
01:04:04,895 --> 01:04:06,288
Who dies after Olivia?

930
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:42,700
<i>Roy?</i>

931
01:04:42,867 --> 01:04:44,589
<i>Would you come
to the control room, please?</i>

932
01:04:45,289 --> 01:04:47,475
Roy, that's the boss.
You in trouble, Roy.

933
01:05:04,438 --> 01:05:06,543
Ok, schoolboy, what do you
wanna talk to me about?

934
01:05:06,610 --> 01:05:07,767
What is with your timecard?

935
01:05:07,791 --> 01:05:09,409
Let's talk about my timecard.

936
01:05:09,506 --> 01:05:10,603
You cut my hours,

937
01:05:11,038 --> 01:05:11,975
which means you cut my pay!

938
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:13,516
I cut everyone's hours, ok?

939
01:05:13,547 --> 01:05:16,707
Corporate has us operating in less
than 50% until this thing blows over.

940
01:05:16,749 --> 01:05:18,751
My bookie ain't operating at 50 percent.

941
01:05:18,832 --> 01:05:21,438
My dumb kid ain't operating at 50%.
Roy.

942
01:05:21,645 --> 01:05:24,892
My ex-wife, she's taking 50%,
so I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

943
01:05:24,945 --> 01:05:26,107
No, no, we gotta move, man.

944
01:05:26,132 --> 01:05:27,545
Hey I'm not going anywhere.
We gotta move!

945
01:05:27,570 --> 01:05:28,059
Hey!

946
01:05:28,338 --> 01:05:29,431
Gotta move, sir!

947
01:05:29,456 --> 01:05:30,564
We gotta move now!
Hey! Get of...

948
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:41,676
Roy!

949
01:05:41,899 --> 01:05:43,030
You ok down there?

950
01:05:48,075 --> 01:05:49,577
Hey, Dennis?
Hey.

951
01:05:51,668 --> 01:05:53,015
They're closing us down.

952
01:05:53,888 --> 01:05:54,997
They're shutting down the plant?

953
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:56,065
Not the plant,

954
01:05:56,553 --> 01:05:57,400
just us.

955
01:05:58,066 --> 01:05:59,466
Just sales and administration.

956
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:00,499
Can you believe it?

957
01:06:00,643 --> 01:06:01,261
Us?

958
01:06:01,646 --> 01:06:03,935
It's the factory guys
that usually get laid off.

959
01:06:04,015 --> 01:06:05,435
Not us, we're supposed to be safe.

960
01:06:05,503 --> 01:06:07,415
Yeah, Dennis we got bigger problems.

961
01:06:08,861 --> 01:06:10,613
Olivia and Isaac are dead.

962
01:06:11,468 --> 01:06:12,259
Who's Isaac?

963
01:06:12,805 --> 01:06:13,457
Isaac,

964
01:06:13,912 --> 01:06:15,339
Palmer, tech support.

965
01:06:17,031 --> 01:06:18,283
Wasn't he dead already?

966
01:06:18,685 --> 01:06:19,645
No, Dennis.

967
01:06:19,893 --> 01:06:20,464
Listen,

968
01:06:21,226 --> 01:06:22,883
it's going to happen to us too...

969
01:06:23,027 --> 01:06:24,673
if we don't do something about it.

970
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:26,804
Yeah, I understand.

971
01:06:26,828 --> 01:06:29,265
Listen, it's called survivor's guilt.

972
01:06:29,405 --> 01:06:30,091
No.

973
01:06:30,765 --> 01:06:33,178
No. Guilt doesn't kill you.

974
01:06:33,573 --> 01:06:35,541
Obviously, you've never met my in-laws.

975
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:37,729
I'm not fucking around here, Dennis.

976
01:06:38,086 --> 01:06:39,423
Anyone could be next.

977
01:06:39,923 --> 01:06:40,860
It could be you.

978
01:06:41,202 --> 01:06:42,182
Understand?

979
01:06:42,632 --> 01:06:43,722
Nobody's safe.

980
01:06:44,251 --> 01:06:45,596
What are you talking about?

981
01:06:48,140 --> 01:06:50,300
We weren't supposed to survive
that bridge collapse.

982
01:06:50,666 --> 01:06:52,413
And so now, it's kill...

983
01:06:52,796 --> 01:06:53,740
or be killed.

984
01:06:54,535 --> 01:06:55,583
You get that, Dennis?

985
01:06:57,870 --> 01:06:58,663
Whatever.

986
01:06:58,886 --> 01:06:59,754
I warned you.

987
01:07:00,430 --> 01:07:01,610
Do whatever you wanna do.

988
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:06,526
I will.

989
01:07:12,113 --> 01:07:13,698
Hey, Agent Block, it's Dennis.

990
01:07:14,579 --> 01:07:18,504
Listen, Pete just came in here
and he's just completely lost it.

991
01:07:18,625 --> 01:07:20,738
He's yelling about kill or be killed.

992
01:07:21,666 --> 01:07:23,903
Oh, yeah, it definitely sounded
like a threat.

993
01:07:41,474 --> 01:07:42,434
What happened?

994
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:43,464
I don't know.

995
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:45,649
I don't know.
It just happened so fast.

996
01:07:45,812 --> 01:07:46,675
Nathan.

997
01:07:47,547 --> 01:07:48,814
Are you ok?
Yeah.

998
01:07:48,854 --> 01:07:50,388
We heard and we thought...
No. No, I...

999
01:07:50,865 --> 01:07:51,714
I'm good.

1000
01:07:53,605 --> 01:07:54,500
Did you kill him?

1001
01:07:55,113 --> 01:07:55,887
What?

1002
01:07:56,406 --> 01:07:57,269
No. No, I...

1003
01:07:57,699 --> 01:07:58,472
I just...

1004
01:07:59,292 --> 01:08:00,898
It was just timing, you know?

1005
01:08:00,922 --> 01:08:02,132
He got in the way and...

1006
01:08:02,203 --> 01:08:03,352
No, you did, didn't you? You...

1007
01:08:03,736 --> 01:08:05,623
You saw it coming,
and then you took his life.

1008
01:08:06,042 --> 01:08:07,016
You put him in the way.

1009
01:08:07,041 --> 01:08:08,555
No, I didn't really do anything.

1010
01:08:09,049 --> 01:08:10,574
Tell us the truth. Did you or didn't you?

1011
01:08:10,598 --> 01:08:11,781
Hey, Peter, calm down.

1012
01:08:11,806 --> 01:08:13,308
Did you or didn't you?

1013
01:08:16,396 --> 01:08:17,573
Did you or didn't you?

1014
01:08:19,298 --> 01:08:19,917
Yes.

1015
01:08:21,246 --> 01:08:22,222
I think I did.

1016
01:08:23,005 --> 01:08:23,945
I killed him.

1017
01:08:25,245 --> 01:08:26,507
So if the theory works,

1018
01:08:26,698 --> 01:08:28,352
then you traded spots.

1019
01:08:28,603 --> 01:08:29,636
He should have your death,

1020
01:08:29,916 --> 01:08:30,553
and...

1021
01:08:30,869 --> 01:08:32,176
you should have his years.

1022
01:08:33,009 --> 01:08:34,023
How do we know for sure?

1023
01:08:34,363 --> 01:08:36,183
I think there's an order to these deaths.

1024
01:08:37,614 --> 01:08:39,687
They mirror the order
everyone died in on the bridge.

1025
01:08:40,742 --> 01:08:42,167
Then who would be next?

1026
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:46,623
Who wants to be first to tell me
what the hell happened?

1027
01:08:47,081 --> 01:08:48,128
Who is it, Sam?

1028
01:08:48,617 --> 01:08:49,479
Who's what?

1029
01:08:54,631 --> 01:08:55,286
Dennis!

1030
01:08:56,424 --> 01:08:57,254
It was Dennis.

1031
01:08:57,592 --> 01:08:58,697
No shit.

1032
01:09:00,695 --> 01:09:01,588
Jesus.

1033
01:09:05,693 --> 01:09:07,536
Why are you fighting me on this?

1034
01:09:07,602 --> 01:09:09,980
You're not seriously going to work,
are you?

1035
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:10,759
Molly,

1036
01:09:11,934 --> 01:09:13,880
Isaac died on a massage table.

1037
01:09:15,020 --> 01:09:17,213
If Death is gonna come for me,
I don't think it matters where I am.

1038
01:09:17,238 --> 01:09:18,617
You have to do something.

1039
01:09:19,557 --> 01:09:21,061
What, kill someone so I can live?

1040
01:09:21,085 --> 01:09:22,276
No, of course not.

1041
01:09:23,008 --> 01:09:24,934
We'll just have to
figure something else out.

1042
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:26,508
I have figured it out.

1043
01:09:27,838 --> 01:09:29,804
Something saved me, on that bridge.

1044
01:09:30,925 --> 01:09:32,417
Maybe it doesn't want me to die.

1045
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:35,857
Maybe.

1046
01:09:36,738 --> 01:09:38,783
We can't live our lives in fear, Moll.

1047
01:09:41,886 --> 01:09:43,459
So if it happens tomorrow,

1048
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:46,137
or 50 years from now, whatever.

1049
01:09:46,349 --> 01:09:47,697
As long as we're together...

1050
01:09:49,957 --> 01:09:50,870
I'll be ok.

1051
01:09:54,031 --> 01:09:54,553
Right?

1052
01:09:54,791 --> 01:09:56,444
Why don't you come by after my shift...

1053
01:09:57,421 --> 01:09:58,964
and I'll make you a nice late dinner, ok?

1054
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:08,673
Alright, give me this.

1055
01:10:38,359 --> 01:10:39,827
Veal's ready, take it out.

1056
01:10:40,159 --> 01:10:42,052
Samuel. Get to work on the bourguignon.

1057
01:10:52,339 --> 01:10:53,386
Pan coming through.

1058
01:10:55,295 --> 01:10:56,125
Watch yourself.

1059
01:11:22,195 --> 01:11:23,538
That could've been ugly?

1060
01:11:23,963 --> 01:11:24,727
Yeah.

1061
01:11:25,263 --> 01:11:26,250
Could've been.

1062
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:07,106
Hey, clean that grate.

1063
01:12:16,088 --> 01:12:17,388
Just met your girlfriend.

1064
01:12:19,085 --> 01:12:21,361
Are you sure it's ok
if I make her a little something?

1065
01:12:22,791 --> 01:12:24,265
Make sure to clean up afterward.

1066
01:12:24,754 --> 01:12:26,587
I will, of course. Thank you.

1067
01:12:29,072 --> 01:12:29,887
And chef...

1068
01:12:31,848 --> 01:12:33,028
The apprenticeship.

1069
01:12:34,033 --> 01:12:35,521
If the offer still stands...

1070
01:12:36,721 --> 01:12:37,827
I'd like to take it.

1071
01:12:39,564 --> 01:12:40,593
It's yours.

1072
01:12:55,788 --> 01:12:57,527
Ok, no more suspense.

1073
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:00,361
What you've been waiting for.

1074
01:13:04,137 --> 01:13:05,306
You're gonna help me with this, right?

1075
01:13:05,464 --> 01:13:06,932
Yeah, sure, if you want me to...

1076
01:13:06,957 --> 01:13:08,459
No? You don't want me to...?

1077
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:10,557
So how's your French?

1078
01:13:11,726 --> 01:13:12,486
Terrible.

1079
01:13:13,605 --> 01:13:15,766
Oh, good. Well, then,
we can be terrible together.

1080
01:13:17,429 --> 01:13:18,173
Why?

1081
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:19,860
I took the internship.

1082
01:13:20,846 --> 01:13:21,593
What?

1083
01:13:22,057 --> 01:13:23,506
Sam, that's amazing.

1084
01:13:27,945 --> 01:13:29,743
I'm so proud of you.

1085
01:13:47,096 --> 01:13:48,683
Peter.
Hey.

1086
01:13:51,322 --> 01:13:52,750
You ok, man?

1087
01:13:52,775 --> 01:13:54,729
You look a little, upset.

1088
01:13:54,812 --> 01:13:56,462
Yeah! Yeah, yeah.
Just a...

1089
01:13:56,958 --> 01:13:58,105
rough couple days.

1090
01:13:59,189 --> 01:14:00,007
Yeah.

1091
01:14:00,931 --> 01:14:01,816
Yeah, for everyone.

1092
01:14:02,939 --> 01:14:04,356
For some more than others.

1093
01:14:05,746 --> 01:14:06,923
Do you mind if I come in?

1094
01:14:07,946 --> 01:14:09,369
Yeah, of course.
Yeah, come in.

1095
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:16,300
Here, have a seat.

1096
01:14:17,536 --> 01:14:18,326
Thanks.

1097
01:14:23,357 --> 01:14:24,609
Hey, Peter.

1098
01:14:25,711 --> 01:14:26,805
Hi, Molly.

1099
01:14:42,797 --> 01:14:44,426
Peter, can I get you anything to eat?

1100
01:14:44,996 --> 01:14:46,510
I can make you up some pasta.

1101
01:14:46,732 --> 01:14:48,138
No. No, no, no. I'm good.

1102
01:14:48,564 --> 01:14:49,517
Thank you.

1103
01:14:51,991 --> 01:14:53,834
I'm sorry. I just, I just thought...

1104
01:14:53,977 --> 01:14:56,533
Peter, it's good that you're here.
You shouldn't be alone right now.

1105
01:14:57,064 --> 01:14:59,053
Yeah, you know,
I'm surprised I'm here at all.

1106
01:15:02,268 --> 01:15:03,680
Still alive, I mean.

1107
01:15:04,417 --> 01:15:05,760
I'm next to go, right?

1108
01:15:07,333 --> 01:15:08,878
It's me and then you, isn't it?

1109
01:15:11,675 --> 01:15:12,871
Anyways, I...

1110
01:15:13,161 --> 01:15:14,621
I was up all last night,

1111
01:15:15,147 --> 01:15:15,907
you know...

1112
01:15:16,707 --> 01:15:17,501
thinking...

1113
01:15:18,094 --> 01:15:19,487
about if I could really do it.

1114
01:15:20,455 --> 01:15:21,255
Do what?

1115
01:15:21,802 --> 01:15:23,095
Take someone else's life.

1116
01:15:24,284 --> 01:15:26,051
If I could actually kill some stranger,

1117
01:15:26,515 --> 01:15:27,344
replace...

1118
01:15:28,375 --> 01:15:29,541
their life with my own.

1119
01:15:30,673 --> 01:15:32,395
And I thought about it and I...

1120
01:15:33,415 --> 01:15:34,882
I convinced myself that...

1121
01:15:36,761 --> 01:15:37,755
yeah, I could.

1122
01:15:40,786 --> 01:15:42,202
So I went on a walk.

1123
01:15:43,618 --> 01:15:45,512
You know, nowhere in particular but...

1124
01:15:46,385 --> 01:15:48,878
every couple of minutes,
an opportunity would just present itself

1125
01:15:50,036 --> 01:15:51,288
Like, like clockwork.

1126
01:15:52,648 --> 01:15:54,580
I could just grab somebody
and, and...

1127
01:15:54,604 --> 01:15:55,643
pull them into an alley.

1128
01:15:56,218 --> 01:15:58,208
Or, or just shove somebody...

1129
01:15:58,459 --> 01:16:00,004
off a curb into traffic.

1130
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:01,378
You know?

1131
01:16:03,141 --> 01:16:04,234
It'd be real easy.

1132
01:16:06,939 --> 01:16:08,374
Peter, what did you do?

1133
01:16:17,327 --> 01:16:19,227
Did you...
No, I didn't.

1134
01:16:22,453 --> 01:16:23,378
I couldn't.

1135
01:16:24,262 --> 01:16:25,378
I realized that...

1136
01:16:26,212 --> 01:16:28,685
I couldn't kill somebody
that didn't deserve to die.

1137
01:16:31,869 --> 01:16:33,535
And I thought about Candice,
and I thought...

1138
01:16:33,786 --> 01:16:34,669
Wait a minute.

1139
01:16:36,558 --> 01:16:38,602
Candice didn't deserve to die.

1140
01:16:41,347 --> 01:16:42,294
Olivia didn't.

1141
01:16:42,318 --> 01:16:43,380
Dennis didn't.

1142
01:16:44,896 --> 01:16:45,800
I don't.

1143
01:16:48,354 --> 01:16:49,254
Do I?

1144
01:16:49,982 --> 01:16:51,627
No, of course you don't.

1145
01:16:54,985 --> 01:16:55,758
Well...

1146
01:16:57,571 --> 01:16:58,598
none of us...

1147
01:16:59,264 --> 01:17:01,063
deserve to die, then I...

1148
01:17:02,144 --> 01:17:03,010
why is it...

1149
01:17:05,054 --> 01:17:06,777
that you deserve to live,

1150
01:17:07,260 --> 01:17:07,960
Molly?

1151
01:17:10,001 --> 01:17:11,298
You said it yourself...

1152
01:17:12,484 --> 01:17:13,411
you don't.

1153
01:17:19,218 --> 01:17:19,931
Go!

1154
01:17:21,387 --> 01:17:22,960
Repeat, shots fired.

1155
01:17:22,984 --> 01:17:25,071
Requesting backup. 1026 Washington.

1156
01:17:26,684 --> 01:17:28,790
Hide and I'll distract him.
When you can, go.

1157
01:17:32,189 --> 01:17:33,657
Not done yet, Sam.

1158
01:17:36,318 --> 01:17:37,304
Where is she?

1159
01:17:39,837 --> 01:17:40,894
Where is she?

1160
01:17:41,118 --> 01:17:42,964
I'm not gonna let you hurt her, Peter.

1161
01:17:43,718 --> 01:17:44,911
You're gonna have to kill me first.

1162
01:17:45,425 --> 01:17:46,857
Well, that doesn't do me any good.

1163
01:17:48,034 --> 01:17:49,286
Death's after you too.

1164
01:17:49,665 --> 01:17:51,551
This is crazy Peter. Don't do this.

1165
01:17:52,918 --> 01:17:54,116
Just think...

1166
01:17:54,678 --> 01:17:56,111
for a minute, alright?

1167
01:17:56,885 --> 01:17:58,157
You are not a killer.

1168
01:17:59,799 --> 01:18:01,426
I don't wanna kill anybody, Sam.

1169
01:18:04,638 --> 01:18:06,098
I don't wanna die yet either.

1170
01:18:13,722 --> 01:18:15,030
It's not your time yet.

1171
01:18:24,233 --> 01:18:26,088
Don't worry Molly...

1172
01:18:28,478 --> 01:18:29,731
I didn't kill him.

1173
01:18:32,416 --> 01:18:33,905
But I didn't need to,

1174
01:18:35,011 --> 01:18:36,137
Molly because...

1175
01:18:37,452 --> 01:18:38,326
because Death,

1176
01:18:39,104 --> 01:18:40,497
is gonna do that for me.

1177
01:18:41,759 --> 01:18:43,279
Doesn't mean I can't help it.

1178
01:18:46,096 --> 01:18:47,072
That's it.

1179
01:19:29,515 --> 01:19:30,545
Are you ok?

1180
01:19:31,115 --> 01:19:33,148
What's going on?
It's Peter. He has a gun.

1181
01:19:37,982 --> 01:19:39,007
Oh, my God.

1182
01:19:43,227 --> 01:19:44,620
You, you killed him.

1183
01:19:52,121 --> 01:19:53,271
It's Sam's turn.

1184
01:19:59,712 --> 01:20:00,408
Peter,

1185
01:20:01,129 --> 01:20:02,181
just go.

1186
01:20:02,635 --> 01:20:05,379
You have Block's life, you're safe now.

1187
01:20:06,635 --> 01:20:07,521
Please.

1188
01:20:08,345 --> 01:20:09,521
I'm sorry, Molly.

1189
01:20:12,577 --> 01:20:14,577
You just witnessed the murder
of a federal agent.

1190
01:20:17,846 --> 01:20:20,011
And I'm not gonna spend
the life I just earned...

1191
01:20:21,745 --> 01:20:22,725
in prison.

1192
01:20:33,853 --> 01:20:35,593
Molly, go!
Go get help!

1193
01:21:04,193 --> 01:21:05,606
You son of a bitch!

1194
01:21:44,608 --> 01:21:45,555
Tell Candice...

1195
01:21:46,974 --> 01:21:47,828
I love her.

1196
01:21:48,368 --> 01:21:49,181
Peter.

1197
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:16,002
It's gone.

1198
01:22:16,632 --> 01:22:17,553
You killed him.

1199
01:22:19,437 --> 01:22:21,000
So does that mean I get Block's life?

1200
01:22:23,689 --> 01:22:24,379
Yeah.

1201
01:22:26,013 --> 01:22:26,653
Yeah.

1202
01:22:28,193 --> 01:22:29,273
I guess I do.

1203
01:22:45,824 --> 01:22:47,697
Hey do you mind
if I take the window seat?

1204
01:22:48,101 --> 01:22:49,687
Are you kidding me, You're gonna
make me sit in the middle seat?

1205
01:22:51,175 --> 01:22:52,289
I'm like twice your size.

1206
01:22:52,665 --> 01:22:53,638
Not really.

1207
01:22:53,663 --> 01:22:54,374
Alright.

1208
01:22:54,597 --> 01:22:55,505
Sit down.

1209
01:22:55,679 --> 01:22:58,023
I'll remove him.
Fuck you. I'll remove myself.

1210
01:22:58,089 --> 01:22:59,091
Get off him!

1211
01:22:59,511 --> 01:23:00,417
Settle down!

1212
01:23:00,842 --> 01:23:03,721
Come on, Browning! Come on, you punk!
Get off the plane!

1213
01:23:03,746 --> 01:23:04,719
Get off the plane.

1214
01:23:04,956 --> 01:23:06,366
You don't understand!

1215
01:23:06,701 --> 01:23:08,945
Everybody just stay where you are.

1216
01:23:10,652 --> 01:23:11,766
What's all that about?

1217
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:13,593
I have no idea.

1218
01:23:14,574 --> 01:23:15,520
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1219
01:23:15,545 --> 01:23:17,861
<i>we'll be pulling away
from the gate as...</i>

1220
01:23:23,665 --> 01:23:24,507
Here we go.

1221
01:23:24,984 --> 01:23:27,000
<i>The cabin lights have been
dimmed for takeoff</i>

1222
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:30,306
<i>L' éclairage de la cabine

1223
01:23:57,412 --> 01:23:59,705
<i>♪ Dust in the wind ♪</i>

1224
01:24:12,447 --> 01:24:13,699
Sorry about that.

1225
01:24:15,968 --> 01:24:17,161
Oh, excuse me.

1226
01:24:18,387 --> 01:24:21,461
Those passengers
who got off the plane earlier,

1227
01:24:21,826 --> 01:24:23,313
what was that all about?

1228
01:24:23,529 --> 01:24:26,039
A kid had a panic attack
and wanted off the plane.

1229
01:24:26,374 --> 01:24:28,297
Said he had some kind of vision.

1230
01:24:29,022 --> 01:24:29,862
No.

1231
01:24:32,484 --> 01:24:33,576
Oh, my God!

1232
01:24:38,775 --> 01:24:39,488
Sam.

1233
01:25:08,186 --> 01:25:09,312
I got you!

1234
01:25:11,723 --> 01:25:12,543
Sam!

1235
01:25:12,688 --> 01:25:14,416
Sam!
Molly, hold on!

1236
01:25:16,028 --> 01:25:17,075
No!

1237
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:20,787
No!

1238
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:46,520
Nice of you to come, Nathan.

1239
01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:49,103
I know Roy wasn't
the easiest guy to work with.

1240
01:25:50,187 --> 01:25:51,033
You know.

1241
01:25:51,730 --> 01:25:53,539
I still can't believe he's gone, though.

1242
01:25:54,024 --> 01:25:54,637
Yeah.

1243
01:25:54,661 --> 01:25:55,626
Yeah, no kidding.

1244
01:25:56,652 --> 01:25:58,219
I guess it was for the best.

1245
01:25:59,404 --> 01:26:00,405
What do you mean?

1246
01:26:00,846 --> 01:26:03,543
Company did an autopsy
for insurance purposes.

1247
01:26:04,056 --> 01:26:07,123
Turns out Roy had an enlarged
blood vessel in his brain so big...

1248
01:26:07,436 --> 01:26:08,485
it was about to burst.

1249
01:26:08,776 --> 01:26:10,469
They said he'd be dead any day now.

1250
01:26:13,085 --> 01:26:14,035
Any day?

1251
01:26:15,671 --> 01:26:16,718
Life's a bitch.
