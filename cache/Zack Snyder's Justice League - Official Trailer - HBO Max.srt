LEX LUTHOR:
The bell's been rung.

3
00:00:20,619 --> 00:00:21,621
Out in the dark

4
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:25,158
among the stars...

5
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:30,697
the god is dead.

00:00:35,034 --> 00:00:36,436
BRUCE WAYNE:
I had a dream...

7
00:00:39,171 --> 00:00:40,540
almost like a premonition...

8
00:00:43,976 --> 00:00:45,311
that there's an attack coming.

00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:49,749
STEPPENWOLF:
My lord. This world will fall.

10
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,121
I need warriors.

11
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:57,656
I'm building an alliance

12
00:00:58,023 --> 00:00:59,392
to defend ourselves.

13
00:01:01,026 --> 00:01:03,296
ALFRED PENNYWORTH:
How do you know your team's
strong enough?

14
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:06,966
If you can't bring down
the charging bull,

15
00:01:07,066 --> 00:01:09,369
then don't wave the red cape
at it.

16
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,409
JONATHAN KENT:
You were sent here for a reason.

17
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:21,781
And even if it takes you
the rest of your life,

18
00:01:24,249 --> 00:01:25,685
find out what that reason is.

19
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:41,634
You said the age of heroes
would never come again.

20
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:51,444
It will. It has to.

THE JOKER:
We live in a society

23
00:01:59,818 --> 00:02:02,889
where honor is a distant memory.

24
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:04,891
Isn't that right...

25
00:02:06,992 --> 00:02:08,194
Batman?
