No, it's Savage's forces

wasn't the brightest idea.

Unfortunately, we no longer
have the luxury

33

of blindly searching for Savage
throughout history.

34
00:01:29,841 --> 00:01:31,509
Indeed. We have to target Savage

35

<i>at the time and place</i>

36

37
00:01:34,345 --> 00:01:36,514
Right before he wastes your family.

38
00:01:37,682 --> 00:01:38,725
What?

Yes, Mr. Rory,

Savage will kill my wife and son
in three days' time.

41
00:01:42,228 --> 00:01:45,023
But we can save them, and the world,

42
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:46,816

45
00:01:54,073 --> 00:01:56,201
Set us down on the outskirts
of the city, Gideon.

46

<i>Near the encampment of
the remaining resistance forces.</i>

49

163
00:08:14,412 --> 00:08:15,663
We'll be back.

164
00:08:16,873 --> 00:08:20,877
So, what did you mean back there,
about your family?

165
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:22,503
I'd rather not discuss it.

166
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,714
Yeah, I picked up on that.

167
00:08:24,881 --> 00:08:26,733
I also picked up on the fact
that we're in London

168
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:31,053
just a few days before Savage
tries to kill your wife and son,

169
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,014
and you're not trying
to get them to safety.

170
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:37,894
After my first attempt on Savage
in ancient Egypt,

171
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:40,730
my very next stop was here in 2166.

172
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,775
I found Miranda and Jonas
exactly where I'd left them

173
00:08:45,943 --> 00:08:47,612
and we raced towards the <i>Waverider.</i>

174
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:53,326
But we had a run-in
with Savage's shock troopers.

175
00:08:55,161 --> 00:08:57,163
Miranda and Jonas were cut down.

176
00:09:01,751 --> 00:09:05,421
So, uh, I jumped even further back.

177
00:09:07,256 --> 00:09:09,467
And the outcome was exactly the same.

178
00:09:11,928 --> 00:09:15,139
I watched my family die countless times

179
00:09:15,306 --> 00:09:17,350
at the hands of Savage and his forces

180
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:19,268
before I realized that...

181
00:09:21,604 --> 00:09:23,606
Time wants to happen.

182
00:09:27,151 --> 00:09:28,337
It's a funny feeling knowing that

183
00:09:28,361 --> 00:09:31,113
the universe itself doesn't
want you to save your family.

184
00:09:33,366 --> 00:09:35,117
All right, what are you all playing at?

185
00:09:35,284 --> 00:09:36,702
I retina-scanned the four of you.

186
00:09:36,869 --> 00:09:38,229
There's no record of you anywhere.

187
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:40,498
And you and your friends
disappeared 150 years ago.

188
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,792
Believe me when I tell you

189
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,144
it will take about that much time

190
00:09:44,168 --> 00:09:45,503
for us to tell the whole story.

191
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,129
But the most important thing

192
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:48,899
is that we get as close
to Vandal Savage as possible.

193
00:09:48,923 --> 00:09:51,342
No one gets close to Savage.
Especially not now.

194
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:54,470
Some idiots made an attempt
on his life earlier tonight.

195
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:56,359
He's gone to ground
in the citadel's bunker

196
00:09:56,389 --> 00:09:57,848
and he's holed up good and tight.

197
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,493
MAN: (ON RADIO)
<i>Delta Camp is under attack!</i>

198
00:09:59,517 --> 00:10:01,852
<i>Taking heavy fire. We need air support.</i>

199
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:03,187
Where is Delta Camp?

200
00:10:03,479 --> 00:10:05,231
(ENGINE RUMBLING)

201
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,858
Establish a perimeter!

202
00:10:08,276 --> 00:10:09,277
<i>Once it's secure,</i>

203
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:11,696
<i>we'll search for survivors.</i>

204
00:10:12,238 --> 00:10:14,323
Last week, Savage's forces
laid waste to Tokyo.

205
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:16,784
London is the last patch
of free ground on the planet.

206
00:10:17,076 --> 00:10:20,371
<i>Savage's armies have cut down
the most formidable militaries</i>

207
00:10:20,538 --> 00:10:21,539
<i>in the world.</i>

208
00:10:22,206 --> 00:10:24,750
What do you men think you can do
against an evil like this?

209
00:10:41,934 --> 00:10:43,534
There were no survivors from the attack.

210
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:45,455
No, whatever weapon
Savage used against the rebels

211
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:47,648
was quite effective.

212
00:10:47,815 --> 00:10:49,960
Maybe Professor Stein and I
should survey the wreckage,

213
00:10:49,984 --> 00:10:51,068
analyze some soil samples,

214
00:10:51,319 --> 00:10:53,487
determine what kind of weaponry
Savage is using.

215
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:55,382
Until we figure out a way
to thwart his firepower,

216
00:10:55,406 --> 00:10:56,646
the rebels are as good as dead.

217
00:10:56,741 --> 00:10:57,908
Remember why we're here.

218
00:10:58,075 --> 00:11:00,494
To stop Savage, not to slow him down.

219
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:02,663
Do we have a plan
for stealing this bracelet?

220
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:03,873
HEATWAVE: We're on it.

221
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,225
Please don't tell me the plan is

222
00:11:05,249 --> 00:11:07,877
to walk into Savage's citadel
and steal it off her wrist.

223
00:11:08,044 --> 00:11:10,087
All right, I won't tell you that.

224
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:14,258
All right, well, we still have the issue

225
00:11:14,425 --> 00:11:15,760
of how to turn a piece of jewelry

226
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:17,178
into a lethal weapon.

227
00:11:17,345 --> 00:11:19,138
Perhaps there is a reference
to the bracelet

228
00:11:19,305 --> 00:11:20,765
in Professor Boardman's diary.

229
00:11:22,433 --> 00:11:23,476
I doubt it.

230
00:11:24,018 --> 00:11:26,896
I've read through my son's
research 1,000 times.

231
00:11:27,063 --> 00:11:30,524
Savage has a devastating weapon
at his command.

232
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:32,318
And here, now,

233
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:33,944
at the eleventh hour,

234
00:11:34,153 --> 00:11:36,322
we could sorely use a weapon of our own.

235
00:11:37,782 --> 00:11:39,408
I'll look into it.

236
00:11:41,327 --> 00:11:43,412
This is such a waste of time.

237
00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:44,789
I've already looked through

238
00:11:44,955 --> 00:11:47,291
every single page of Aldus' notebooks.

239
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:48,727
If he'd written something specific

240
00:11:48,751 --> 00:11:50,187
about the bracelet and killing Savage,

241
00:11:50,211 --> 00:11:51,712
I would've known it already.

242
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:55,758
Well, here it is.

243
00:12:01,472 --> 00:12:02,807
You ever think about him?

244
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:04,308
Carter?

245
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:07,728
I try not to.

246
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:09,980
It's not like I'll ever see him again.

247
00:12:10,856 --> 00:12:12,525
Not in this lifetime, anyway.

248
00:12:13,818 --> 00:12:15,861
Besides, Carter is my past.

249
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:18,239
Ray is my future.

250
00:12:19,657 --> 00:12:22,535
Still, 4,000-year-long relationship,

251
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:24,141
seems like it'd be hard to get over.

252
00:12:24,662 --> 00:12:25,996
Yeah.

253
00:12:27,331 --> 00:12:29,834
Maybe when Savage is gone,
I can finally start to.

254
00:12:32,962 --> 00:12:34,839
(GRUNTING)

255
00:12:44,682 --> 00:12:48,853
Wow, what's the, uh, occasion?

256
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:50,521
I'll give you one guess.

257
00:12:50,688 --> 00:12:52,690
Our anniversary?

258
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:55,001
Look, I'm sorry, but in my defense,

259
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:56,461
there's quite a few of them to remember.

260
00:12:56,485 --> 00:13:00,614
We were only married in eight lifetimes.

261
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:02,032
That's a lot.

262
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:04,452
But I do remember

263
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:06,287
your Victorian England incarnation

264
00:13:06,454 --> 00:13:08,330
being particularly tough
to be pinned down.

265
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:14,378
Why are you handing this to me?

266
00:13:14,545 --> 00:13:16,046
It's an anniversary gift.

267
00:13:17,715 --> 00:13:19,875
Oh. You have got to stop
giving me weapons as presents.

268
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:21,897
I think it's time you learn how to use it.

269
00:13:22,845 --> 00:13:24,180
But it's your weapon.

270
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:25,973
Savage has murdered us countless times,

271
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,142
and we aren't always
lucky enough to die together.

272
00:13:28,309 --> 00:13:30,352
This is awfully depressing talk
for our anniversary,

273
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:31,729
don't you think?

274
00:13:31,937 --> 00:13:33,230
Kendra, this is important.

275
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:36,233
I need to know that if I go first,

276
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,040
you have everything you need to face him.

277
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:40,821
I don't want to think about facing Savage.

278
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:42,531
Or life without you.

279
00:13:51,749 --> 00:13:53,334
You'll never be without me.

280
00:13:53,501 --> 00:13:55,836
No matter what, I'll always be near.

281
00:13:56,587 --> 00:13:58,255
Just give it a try.

282
00:14:03,928 --> 00:14:05,322
Who's to say I'll ever be strong enough

283
00:14:05,346 --> 00:14:06,722
to kill Savage by myself?

284
00:14:07,765 --> 00:14:09,099
Just trust me.

285
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,602
You have everything you need.

286
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:21,737
SARA: <i>What is it?</i>

287
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,949
I think I know what we can use
to kill Savage.

288
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:35,626
(GRUNTING)

289
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:46,470
Savage has warned you all

290
00:14:46,637 --> 00:14:48,138
about the radicals who oppose us.

291
00:14:49,098 --> 00:14:51,433
They will not show you
the mercy I just did.

292
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:53,894
Dismissed.

293
00:15:00,985 --> 00:15:02,945
I said you're dismissed.

294
00:15:07,658 --> 00:15:10,160
We thought you said, "Missed."

295
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:12,496
Whoever you are,
you're certainly persistent.

296
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:14,999
Not really.

297
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:17,334
We just like bright, sparkly objects

298
00:15:17,501 --> 00:15:18,586
<i>like that bracelet.</i>

299
00:15:20,504 --> 00:15:22,631
You'd risk dying for a bauble?

300
00:15:22,798 --> 00:15:24,842
It works with my outfit.

301
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:28,345
(ALARM SOUNDING)

302
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:32,349
What now, Mr. Snart?

303
00:15:33,517 --> 00:15:35,019
How do you know my name?

304
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:43,360
And there I was thinking we could go

305
00:15:43,527 --> 00:15:45,087
a whole week without kidnapping anyone.

306
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:48,324
I think you'll find it would've
been better to simply kill me.

307
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:49,533
I agree.

308
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,368
It's a little more complicated than that.

309
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:53,037
She knew who I was.

310
00:15:53,329 --> 00:15:54,788
I know who all of you are.

311
00:15:56,206 --> 00:15:58,542
It's a pleasure to meet you, Gareeb.

312
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:00,169
(CHUCKLES)

313
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:02,379
I see Savage has been rather chatty

314
00:16:02,546 --> 00:16:03,839
with his lieutenants.

315
00:16:04,006 --> 00:16:07,384
If you think I am merely Savage's soldier,

316
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:09,553
you're more idiotic than he claimed.

317
00:16:11,764 --> 00:16:13,724
I'm not his lieutenant.

318
00:16:15,768 --> 00:16:17,227
I'm his daughter.

319
00:16:31,075 --> 00:16:32,743
Vandal Savage has a daughter?

320
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:35,245
Apparently it's true,
there is a lid for every pot.

321
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:36,997
And this lid is gonna be very upset

322
00:16:37,164 --> 00:16:39,083
when he finds out that we took his pot.

323
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:41,877
You know what I mean.

324
00:16:42,044 --> 00:16:43,212
So, what's the problem?

325
00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:45,923
It's not like we're on
Savage's Christmas card list.

326
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:47,841
And we snagged the bracelet.

327
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:49,218
You're welcome, by the way.

328
00:16:49,468 --> 00:16:50,695
RAY: <i>We need to weaponize that thing</i>

329
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:53,013
before Savage knows that
it and his daughter are missing.

330
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,973
Actually, I think
I've got that figured out.

331
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,476
But I'm gonna need you
to burn something for me.

332
00:16:57,643 --> 00:16:58,769
About time.

333
00:16:58,936 --> 00:17:00,104
We also need to figure out

334
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,022
what we're going to do with our new guest.

335
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:03,899
She's seen us and the ship.

336
00:17:04,066 --> 00:17:05,234
If she runs back to Savage,

337
00:17:05,401 --> 00:17:06,944
we're giving him a huge advantage.

338
00:17:07,111 --> 00:17:09,029
So, we make her our advantage.

339
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:10,864
We send Papa Savage a finger.

340
00:17:11,532 --> 00:17:13,075
<i>And we keep sending them</i>

341
00:17:13,242 --> 00:17:15,202
<i>till he puts his own head
on the chopping block.</i>

342
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:17,287
That is a positively lurid idea.

343
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:20,134
I know we're in the midst of a war,
but can't we maintain our honor?

344
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:22,376
I'd rather maintain my life, Professor.

345
00:17:22,793 --> 00:17:24,336
If she is Savage's daughter,

346
00:17:24,503 --> 00:17:26,505
then she would know
the details of his defenses.

347
00:17:26,672 --> 00:17:27,673
Yes, well, how exactly

348
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,600
are we going to get
those details out of her?

349
00:17:30,175 --> 00:17:31,260
I'm on it.

350
00:17:33,971 --> 00:17:34,972
(DOOR OPENS)

351
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:39,476
Hello, Kassy. May I call you "Kassy"?

352
00:17:39,727 --> 00:17:40,769
Here's the deal.

353
00:17:40,978 --> 00:17:43,439
You have information. I want it.

354
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:47,109
The question is, how am I gonna get it?

355
00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:52,740
I'm the daughter of Vandal Savage,

356
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:55,576
<i>the immortal ruler of the world.</i>

357
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:58,996
Do you think he hasn't
prepared me for this?

358
00:17:59,163 --> 00:18:00,843
Do you think I haven't already been taught

359
00:18:00,998 --> 00:18:02,478
to endure the most extreme suffering?

360
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:06,670
You know, your father
sounds a lot like mine.

361
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:08,839
He could never really say, "I love you."

362
00:18:09,715 --> 00:18:11,592
Except with his fists.

363
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:16,096
Our fathers are nothing alike, Mr. Snart.

364
00:18:18,682 --> 00:18:22,102
Fourteen years ago,
the world was ruled by a madman.

365
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:24,146
Per Degaton.

366
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:26,940
He unleashed the Armageddon Virus

367
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:28,859
in order to conquer the globe.

368
00:18:29,026 --> 00:18:31,278
It tore through the world like a fire.

369
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:35,866
Millions died, including my mother.

370
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:40,746
There were riots, wars, hell on Earth.

371
00:18:41,205 --> 00:18:43,749
No one dared to stand up to Degaton,

372
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:45,876
except for my father.

373
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:50,881
He may not be a kind man,
but he is the only one capable

374
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:53,509
<i>of putting this world back together.</i>

375
00:18:55,177 --> 00:18:57,721
So, you can torture me if you like,

376
00:18:59,181 --> 00:19:01,934
my suffering's a small price to pay.

377
00:19:03,227 --> 00:19:05,729
Who said anything about torture?

378
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,364
Are you sure you can do this?

379
00:19:15,823 --> 00:19:18,742
Bash Savage's skull with Carter's mace?

380
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:20,244
You got a better plan?

381
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,246
It's not the weapon I'm worried about.

382
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:25,207
Thousands of years in reincarnation,

383
00:19:25,374 --> 00:19:28,085
and I'm guessing you've killed
a grand total of nobody,

384
00:19:28,502 --> 00:19:31,547
yet here you are entering
into the Olympics of murder.

385
00:19:32,047 --> 00:19:33,173
What's your point?

386
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:36,969
Are you sure you can look Savage
in the eye and kill him?

387
00:19:39,847 --> 00:19:40,889
I'm sure.

388
00:19:41,056 --> 00:19:42,599
Well, you better be.

389
00:19:43,392 --> 00:19:44,643
Otherwise, you're gonna end up

390
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:47,020
like the last guy who swung that thing.

391
00:19:47,855 --> 00:19:48,856
(CLICKS TONGUE)

392
00:19:58,782 --> 00:20:01,493
Savage's super weapon isn't an explosive.

393
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,537
The exact conclusion I've just come to

394
00:20:03,704 --> 00:20:05,998
after examining soil samples
from the attack site.

395
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:07,165
How did you determine it?

396
00:20:07,332 --> 00:20:10,002
Gideon. She found a defunct spy satellite.

397
00:20:10,168 --> 00:20:11,336
Look at the photos here.

398
00:20:11,503 --> 00:20:13,255
This is the camp,

399
00:20:13,422 --> 00:20:15,299
and here is the camp destroyed.

400
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:18,802
Look at the impact craters,
sort of squint your eyes.

401
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:20,470
What do they look like?

402
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:22,431
What am I supposed to be seeing?

403
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:25,767
Oh, my God.

404
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:28,478
Those are not impact craters.

405
00:20:31,815 --> 00:20:32,983
They're footprints.

responsible for your daughter's abduction.

409
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:51,668
The Leviathan is two clicks
from their encampment.

410
00:20:52,502 --> 00:20:55,088
Find my daughter,

411
00:20:55,297 --> 00:20:57,174
and burn them all.

He's coming for me.

414
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:05,682
Yeah, you and a bunch
of innocent refugees.

415
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:07,225
If they were innocent,

416
00:21:07,392 --> 00:21:09,561
they wouldn't have rebelled
against my father.

417
00:21:12,522 --> 00:21:14,358
Whatever it is, it's getting closer.

418
00:21:14,524 --> 00:21:16,860
Well, we're a little short on weapons.

419
00:21:17,027 --> 00:21:19,029
If we can't outrun it,
we'll just have to fight it.

420
00:21:19,196 --> 00:21:20,530
Well, indeed, we can.

421
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,202
But what about them?

422
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,503
This way. Move along.

423
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:36,296
Everything's all right. Move along.

424
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:37,673
Everything's fine.

425
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:40,884
What the hell do you think you're doing?

Saving a township, by the looks of it.

427
00:21:42,844 --> 00:21:44,564
Since when did my vessel
become a life raft?

428
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,680
Since I decided

429
00:21:45,806 --> 00:21:47,283
we can't leave these people here
to be slaughtered.

430

Shut down all essential systems
so Savage's robot doesn't--

449
00:23:26,573 --> 00:23:27,613
GIDEON: <i>Too late, Captain.</i>

<i>Apparently it has determined
you are still alive</i>

451

<i>because it is closing in on our location.</i>

452
00:23:31,036 --> 00:23:32,037
What happened?

453
00:23:32,204 --> 00:23:34,164
We seem to have encountered
Savage's mega-weapon.

454
00:23:34,331 --> 00:23:35,499
And he kicked our ass.

455
00:23:35,665 --> 00:23:36,985
Gideon, how much time do we have?

456
00:23:37,042 --> 00:23:38,853
GIDEON: <i>I estimate the robot
should reach our location</i>

<i>within the hour.</i>

<i>Our propulsion engine was severely damaged</i>

<i>in the crash and is no longer functioning.</i>

460
00:23:43,673 --> 00:23:45,008
So, where does that leave us?

461
00:23:45,175 --> 00:23:46,903
All right. Our only option
is to take the Jumpship

462
00:23:46,927 --> 00:23:47,928
and try and outrun it.

463
00:23:48,178 --> 00:23:49,596
The Jumpship seats seven.

464
00:23:49,846 --> 00:23:51,282
The cargo bay's filled with refugees.

465
00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:52,306
I'm well aware.

466
00:23:52,432 --> 00:23:53,826
Well, we can't just leave them there.

467
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:55,185

Professor, you are gonna be
just fine. I promise you.

- Grey, what happened?
- Jefferson.

471

You'll have to take care of them.

472
00:24:08,615 --> 00:24:09,842
Don't worry. We got the team's back.

473
00:24:09,866 --> 00:24:10,909
No, the people.

474
00:24:11,076 --> 00:24:14,454
Those children. You can't leave them here!

475
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:18,375
You can't leave them here.

476

<i>He should be comfortable.</i>

00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:23,588
Which is more than can be said
for the rest of us.

479
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:30,512
I was wrong. Your dad's a gem.

480
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:33,181
He's just doing what he must
to save his daughter.

481
00:24:33,348 --> 00:24:34,891
Whatever you say. Now, where was I?

482
00:24:35,058 --> 00:24:37,394
Right. Convincing you to help us.

483
00:24:38,145 --> 00:24:40,689
What a charming euphemism
for interrogation.

484
00:24:40,856 --> 00:24:41,976
I know what you're thinking.

485
00:24:42,107 --> 00:24:46,444
"My dad may not be perfect, but
deep down, he's not a bad guy."

486
00:24:49,781 --> 00:24:51,158
What are you doing?

487
00:24:51,324 --> 00:24:54,369
Showing you that
when it comes to crap fathers,

488
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:57,247
there is no deep down.

489
00:24:57,414 --> 00:24:59,040
After you.

490
00:25:12,053 --> 00:25:15,599
These are the ones we could save.
The rest are ash.

491
00:25:15,765 --> 00:25:16,892
<i>Much like Delta Camp.</i>

492
00:25:17,058 --> 00:25:19,227
You don't know my father at all,

493
00:25:19,394 --> 00:25:21,688
if you think his daughter
could be so easily manipulated.

494
00:25:21,855 --> 00:25:23,356
Just trying to show you the truth.

495
00:25:23,523 --> 00:25:25,775
The truth is,
my father was trying to save me.

496
00:25:25,942 --> 00:25:26,985
From what?

497
00:25:27,152 --> 00:25:29,654
Untrained civilians
with barely any weapons?

498
00:25:29,821 --> 00:25:31,656
Your father sent a 200-foot robot

499
00:25:31,823 --> 00:25:33,158
to level a bunch of tents.

500
00:25:33,325 --> 00:25:35,577
The people in that camp were rebels.

501
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,870
Dangerous radicals.

502
00:25:37,037 --> 00:25:39,873
Please. Do these people
look like radicals to you?

503
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,458
<i>They're nobodies.</i>

504
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:45,503
Everyday folk, hoping to survive
your father's reign of terror.

505
00:25:46,171 --> 00:25:50,634
Look, it took me a long time to
accept my old man was a monster.

506
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,761
I'm betting you're smarter than I am.

507
00:25:53,511 --> 00:25:54,721
At last.

508
00:25:54,888 --> 00:25:56,223
Something we agree on.

509
00:25:58,767 --> 00:26:02,145
Oh, Per Degaton didn't release
the Armageddon Virus.

510
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:03,855
That was your father.

511
00:26:04,856 --> 00:26:06,524
Impossible.

512
00:26:06,691 --> 00:26:08,568
He was only Per Degaton's tutor.

513
00:26:08,735 --> 00:26:11,196
One, Per Degaton was only
a teenager at the time.

514
00:26:11,363 --> 00:26:13,907
Two, he was hardly a criminal mastermind.

515
00:26:14,199 --> 00:26:16,034
Your father, however...

516
00:26:16,201 --> 00:26:18,662
What makes you think
I'd believe anything you tell me?

517
00:26:18,828 --> 00:26:20,580
Because seeing is believing.

518
00:26:20,747 --> 00:26:23,458
Gideon, show her the footage.

519
00:26:24,167 --> 00:26:27,545
<i>Kasnia, November 3rd, 2147.</i>

unsustainable at current levels.</i>

521
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:35,178
<i>The herd must be thinned.</i>

522
00:26:35,971 --> 00:26:37,180
This isn't true.

523
00:26:40,183 --> 00:26:41,268
You're a liar.

524
00:26:41,434 --> 00:26:43,603
Correct, but not about this.

525
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:47,023
And you know it, deep down.

526
00:27:01,746 --> 00:27:03,039
How are repairs coming?

527
00:27:04,457 --> 00:27:05,875
Are repairs coming?

528
00:27:06,376 --> 00:27:07,711
Not in 30 minutes,

529
00:27:07,877 --> 00:27:09,437
which is about as much time as we have.

530
00:27:09,462 --> 00:27:11,298
We brought all those people onboard

531
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:12,465
and all we've bought them

532
00:27:12,632 --> 00:27:14,232
is an extra few minutes to live in fear.

533
00:27:15,385 --> 00:27:16,585
Well, I guess the question is,

534
00:27:16,636 --> 00:27:17,947
what do we do with those minutes?

535
00:27:17,971 --> 00:27:19,973
The ship is crippled.

536
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,392
Everyone aboard is as dead as my...

537
00:27:23,476 --> 00:27:24,477
Family?

538
00:27:25,729 --> 00:27:29,232
<i>Look, I know you think
the universe wants them dead.</i>

539
00:27:30,066 --> 00:27:34,070
But I don't believe in fate.
I believe in choices.

540
00:27:35,905 --> 00:27:39,242
And we can choose. We can choose to fight.

541
00:27:39,784 --> 00:27:42,078
<i>Even if that fight may be futile.</i>

542
00:27:42,579 --> 00:27:43,913
We can save your family, Rip.

543
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,582
It's not impossible.

544
00:27:45,749 --> 00:27:48,209
- All we have to do--
- Is kill Vandal Savage.

545
00:27:48,376 --> 00:27:50,670
The chances of which appear to be fading.

546
00:27:51,963 --> 00:27:53,089
Not anymore.

547
00:27:53,256 --> 00:27:54,632
I figured out how to do it.

548
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:57,427
And my new bestie and I can get us in.

549
00:27:59,054 --> 00:28:00,096
And I think I've got a way

550
00:28:00,305 --> 00:28:02,515
to stop the giant robot
that's coming to kill us.

551
00:28:08,271 --> 00:28:10,357
Now, you may not believe in fate, Raymond,

552
00:28:10,607 --> 00:28:13,443
but I certainly do.

553
00:28:14,027 --> 00:28:16,112
And perhaps it was fate that compelled me

554
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:17,614
to bring you seven together,

555
00:28:17,781 --> 00:28:22,118

It's not that nutso

when you consider
the theoretical possibility

that siphoning power
from the auxiliary time drive
