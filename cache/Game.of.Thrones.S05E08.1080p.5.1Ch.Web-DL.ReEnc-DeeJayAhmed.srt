1
00:02:05,528 --> 00:02:07,974
Your Grace, I want to say...

2
00:02:08,048 --> 00:02:09,413
You will not speak.

3
00:02:12,128 --> 00:02:14,017
How do I know you are who you say you are?

4
00:02:15,008 --> 00:02:16,658
If only I were otherwise.

5
00:02:16,728 --> 00:02:19,652
If you are Tyrion Lannister,
why shouldn't I kill you

6
00:02:19,728 --> 00:02:22,299
to pay your family back
for what it did to mine?

7
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:24,888
You want revenge against the Lannisters?

8
00:02:24,968 --> 00:02:28,495
I killed my mother, Joanna Lannister,
on the day I was born.

9
00:02:28,928 --> 00:02:32,171
I killed my father, Tywin Lannister,
with a bolt to the heart.

10
00:02:32,848 --> 00:02:35,089
I am the greatest Lannister
killer of our time.

11
00:02:35,168 --> 00:02:37,330
So I should welcome you into my service

12
00:02:37,408 --> 00:02:39,536
because you murdered members
of your own family?

13
00:02:41,088 --> 00:02:42,772
Into your service?

14
00:02:43,728 --> 00:02:45,935
We have only just met.

15
00:02:46,568 --> 00:02:48,696
It's too soon to know
if you deserve my service.

16
00:02:48,808 --> 00:02:52,813
If you'd rather return to the
fighting pits, just say the word.

17
00:02:56,248 --> 00:02:58,376
When I was a young man, I heard a story

18
00:02:58,448 --> 00:03:01,292
about a baby born
during the worst storm in living memory.

19
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:05,816
She had no wealth, no lands, no army,
only a name

20
00:03:05,888 --> 00:03:08,414
and a handful of supporters,
most of whom probably thought

21
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:11,219
they could use that name
to benefit themselves.

22
00:03:11,288 --> 00:03:13,768
They kept her alive,
moving her from place to place,

23
00:03:13,848 --> 00:03:16,738
often hours ahead
of the men who'd been sent to kill her.

24
00:03:16,808 --> 00:03:20,130
She was eventually sold off to some warlord
on the edge of the world

25
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:22,017
and that appeared to be that.

26
00:03:22,568 --> 00:03:26,653
Then, a few years later,
the most well-informed person I knew

27
00:03:26,968 --> 00:03:29,574
told me that this girl
without wealth, lands, or armies

28
00:03:29,648 --> 00:03:33,050
had somehow acquired all three
in a very short span of time,

29
00:03:33,128 --> 00:03:34,892
along with three dragons.

30
00:03:35,528 --> 00:03:39,169
He thought she was our best,
last chance to build a better world.

31
00:03:41,648 --> 00:03:43,969
I thought you were worth meeting,
at the very least.

32
00:03:44,048 --> 00:03:45,732
And why are you worth meeting?

33
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:47,731
Why should I spend my
time listening to you?

34
00:03:47,808 --> 00:03:50,493
Because you cannot build
a better world on your own.

35
00:03:50,568 --> 00:03:54,414
You have no one at your side
who understands the land you want to rule,

36
00:03:54,488 --> 00:03:57,412
the strengths and weaknesses of the houses
that will either join or oppose you.

37
00:03:57,488 --> 00:03:59,650
I will have a very large army.

38
00:04:00,648 --> 00:04:01,888
And very large dragons.

39
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:04,488
Killing and politics
aren't always the same thing.

40
00:04:06,008 --> 00:04:08,739
When I served as Hand of the King,
I did quite well with the latter,

41
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:10,134
considering the king in question

42
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:13,496
preferred torturing animals
to leading his people.

43
00:04:13,968 --> 00:04:17,495
I could do an even better job
advising a ruler worth the name.

44
00:04:18,168 --> 00:04:19,977
If that is indeed what you are.

45
00:04:20,848 --> 00:04:22,657
So you want to advise me?

46
00:04:25,168 --> 00:04:26,533
Very well.

47
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:29,858
What would you have me do with him?

48
00:04:31,968 --> 00:04:34,733
I swore I would kill him
if he ever returned.

49
00:04:35,688 --> 00:04:37,099
I know.

50
00:04:40,688 --> 00:04:44,295
Why should the people trust a queen
who can't keep her promises?

51
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:50,578
Whomever Ser Jorah was
when he started informing on you,

52
00:04:50,768 --> 00:04:52,497
he is no longer that man.

53
00:04:53,688 --> 00:04:56,055
I can't remember ever seeing a sane man
as devoted to anything

54
00:04:56,128 --> 00:04:57,857
as he is to serving you.

55
00:04:58,448 --> 00:05:00,928
He claims he would kill for you
and die for you

56
00:05:01,008 --> 00:05:04,012
and nothing I have witnessed
gives me reason to doubt him.

57
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:09,898
And yet he did betray you.

58
00:05:22,568 --> 00:05:25,174
Did he have an opportunity
to confess his betrayal?

59
00:05:25,528 --> 00:05:26,575
Yes.

60
00:05:27,408 --> 00:05:29,410
Many opportunities.

61
00:05:30,008 --> 00:05:33,091
TYRION: And did he?
DAENERYS: No.

62
00:05:34,008 --> 00:05:36,409
Not until forced to do so.

63
00:05:41,448 --> 00:05:43,496
He worships you.

64
00:05:43,608 --> 00:05:44,689
He is in love with you, I think.

65
00:05:46,248 --> 00:05:48,330
But he did not trust you with the truth.

66
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:51,770
An unpleasant truth to be sure,
but one of great significance to you.

67
00:05:52,768 --> 00:05:55,851
He did not trust that you
would be wise enough to forgive him.

68
00:05:56,968 --> 00:05:58,811
So I should kill him?

69
00:05:59,768 --> 00:06:04,171
A ruler who kills those devoted to her
is not a ruler who inspires devotion.

70
00:06:04,888 --> 00:06:08,017
And you're going to need to
inspire devotion, a lot of it,

71
00:06:08,088 --> 00:06:11,058
if you're ever going to rule
across the Narrow Sea.

72
00:06:12,488 --> 00:06:15,856
But you cannot have him by your side
when you do.

73
00:06:21,128 --> 00:06:23,130

I hope you'll excuse me for saying it,
but belief is so often the death of reason.

161
00:13:50,088 --> 00:13:52,136
I wish you had said it sooner.

162
00:13:54,688 --> 00:13:56,019
Is there any word from Jaime?

163
00:13:56,568 --> 00:13:58,332
No, I'm afraid not.

164
00:14:04,968 --> 00:14:07,812
Grand Maester Pycelle

165
00:14:09,168 --> 00:14:12,536
has summoned your Uncle Kevan
back from Casterly Rock

166
00:14:12,608 --> 00:14:14,258
to serve as Hand of the King.

167
00:14:14,368 --> 00:14:16,894
He now presides over the Small Council.

168
00:14:18,568 --> 00:14:20,696
Tell him I need to speak to him.

169
00:14:20,768 --> 00:14:23,055
I implored him to visit
you, but he would not.

170
00:14:27,728 --> 00:14:29,457
What about my son, the king?

171
00:14:30,728 --> 00:14:32,696
If you can visit me,
then surely the king...

172
00:14:32,768 --> 00:14:35,055
Your arrest and Queen Margaery's arrest...

173
00:14:35,128 --> 00:14:36,539
The king has not taken them well.

174
00:14:36,928 --> 00:14:38,373
He remains in his chambers.

175
00:14:38,448 --> 00:14:41,577
His servants often find his food
in the hall, left untouched.

176
00:14:42,328 --> 00:14:43,898
You need to talk to him.

177
00:14:43,968 --> 00:14:46,050
You need to talk to my son
and tell him to come and see me,

178
00:14:46,128 --> 00:14:47,289
come and see his mother.

179
00:14:47,368 --> 00:14:51,054
He... I tried. He wouldn't see me.

180
00:14:51,128 --> 00:14:52,857
He won't see anyone.

181
00:14:54,128 --> 00:14:55,618
I can't stay here.

182
00:14:57,408 --> 00:14:59,934
There is a way.

183
00:15:04,048 --> 00:15:05,288
A way out.

184
00:15:07,928 --> 00:15:08,929
Confess?

185
00:15:11,128 --> 00:15:13,529
To the High Sparrow? I won't.

186
00:15:14,928 --> 00:15:16,418
I made him.

187
00:15:17,848 --> 00:15:19,577
I rose him up from nothing.

188
00:15:19,648 --> 00:15:22,333
I will not kneel before
some barefooted commoner

189
00:15:22,408 --> 00:15:24,058
and beg his forgiveness.

190
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:33,691
Good bye.

191
00:15:35,688 --> 00:15:36,849
The work continues.

192
00:16:13,328 --> 00:16:14,568
Why?

193
00:16:16,808 --> 00:16:18,219
Why, Theon?

194
00:16:18,448 --> 00:16:21,577
Not Theon. There is no Theon.

195
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:22,979
- Reek.
- Reek.

196
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:25,335
Why did you tell him, Reek?

197
00:16:26,768 --> 00:16:28,418
I was helping you.

198
00:16:29,008 --> 00:16:30,373
You wanted to escape.

199
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:32,098
There is no escape.

200
00:16:33,568 --> 00:16:34,694
Not ever.

201
00:16:35,848 --> 00:16:37,930
Theon Greyjoy tried to escape.

202
00:16:39,488 --> 00:16:41,252
The master knew.

203
00:16:42,248 --> 00:16:43,773
He knows everything.

204
00:16:44,848 --> 00:16:48,773
He hunted him and caught him
and strapped him to a cross

205
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:53,939
and cut away piece after piece
until there was no Theon left.

206
00:16:58,408 --> 00:16:59,853
Good.

207
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:06,297
If it weren't for you,
I'd still have a family.

208
00:17:07,368 --> 00:17:09,018
If I could do what Ramsay did to you

209
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:12,291
right here, right now, I would.

210
00:17:17,128 --> 00:17:18,812
I deserved everything.

211
00:17:20,968 --> 00:17:22,811
I deserve to be Reek.

212
00:17:24,328 --> 00:17:26,137
I did terrible things.

213
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:29,973
Turned on Robb.

214
00:17:30,888 --> 00:17:32,617
Captured Winterfell.

215
00:17:34,088 --> 00:17:36,090
- Killed those boys.
- They weren't "those boys."

216
00:17:36,168 --> 00:17:38,455
They were Bran and Rickon.
They were your brothers.

217
00:17:38,528 --> 00:17:40,053
You'd known them since they were born.

218
00:17:40,128 --> 00:17:41,539
They weren't. They were only...

219
00:17:41,608 --> 00:17:42,655
Only what?

220
00:17:44,088 --> 00:17:45,374
- I can't.
- Tell me.

221
00:17:45,448 --> 00:17:46,893
I can't, not unless the master says.

222
00:17:46,968 --> 00:17:48,129
- Tell me. They weren't what?
- They weren't...

223
00:17:48,248 --> 00:17:52,617
Tell me why Bran and Rickon should be gone
while you still breathe the air.

224
00:17:52,688 --> 00:17:55,737
Tell me to my face, Theon.
Tell me that they weren't your brothers!

225
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:57,333
They weren't Bran and Rickon!

226
00:17:59,808 --> 00:18:01,298
I couldn't find them.

227
00:18:08,368 --> 00:18:10,018
It was two farm boys.

228
00:18:14,648 --> 00:18:17,128
I killed them and burned them
so no one would know.

229
00:18:21,968 --> 00:18:23,208
You didn't...

230
00:18:25,168 --> 00:18:26,932
Do you know where they went,
Bran and Rickon?

231
00:18:27,008 --> 00:18:27,975
I can't talk to you anymore.

232
00:18:28,048 --> 00:18:30,449
Theon, you have to tell me.
Do you have any idea where...

233
00:18:30,528 --> 00:18:32,690
Not Theon! Reek!

234
00:18:34,688 --> 00:18:35,974
(DOOR SLAMS)

235
00:18:38,088 --> 00:18:41,490
Our scouts tell us
he's got no more than 6,000 men.

236
00:18:41,568 --> 00:18:43,491
More than half of those
are mounted, however.

237
00:18:43,568 --> 00:18:45,809
And how high do Stannis' horses jump?

238
00:18:46,728 --> 00:18:50,733
Our walls have been fully repaired.
The gates have been reinforced.

239
00:18:51,368 --> 00:18:54,019
We have enough food for six months.

240
00:18:54,088 --> 00:18:57,137
We are more prepared for a siege
than they could ever be.

241
00:18:58,248 --> 00:19:03,573
All we have to do is wait for them
to freeze, starve, and mutiny.

242
00:19:06,648 --> 00:19:07,979
You disagree?

243
00:19:08,048 --> 00:19:11,530
Stannis isn't from the North.
You are, Father.

244
00:19:12,368 --> 00:19:15,497
I think you're missing an opportunity
to show the people of the North

245
00:19:15,568 --> 00:19:18,299
how House Bolton treats southern invaders.

246
00:19:18,368 --> 00:19:19,494
And what do you recommend?

247
00:19:19,568 --> 00:19:21,252
That we not sit and wait
for Stannis to decide

248
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:23,456
what sort of fight this is going to be.

249
00:19:23,528 --> 00:19:27,658
That we hit first and hit hard
and leave a feast for the crows.

250
00:19:27,728 --> 00:19:30,811
A smart commander does not
abandon a defensive advantage.

251
00:19:31,568 --> 00:19:34,492
As long as we stay behind these walls,
they can't touch us.

252
00:19:34,568 --> 00:19:36,252
Not to mention that the snow is so deep,

253
00:19:36,328 --> 00:19:39,411
we couldn't get an army through
to engage them even if we wanted to.

254
00:19:39,528 --> 00:19:41,337
I don't need an army.

255
00:19:42,168 --> 00:19:44,296
I need 20 good men.

256
00:19:52,528 --> 00:19:54,212
So, have you decided yet?

257
00:19:54,288 --> 00:19:56,450
Whether I'm worthy of your service?

258
00:19:59,048 --> 00:20:02,211
Have you decided yet
whether you're going to have me killed?

259
00:20:02,288 --> 00:20:04,211
It's probably my safest option.

260
00:20:07,288 --> 00:20:09,131
I could see why you would think so.

261
00:20:09,848 --> 00:20:11,612
It's what your father would have done.

262
00:20:12,728 --> 00:20:14,173
And what would your father have done?

263
00:20:16,528 --> 00:20:20,419
My father, who publically
sentenced me to death?

264
00:20:20,888 --> 00:20:23,937
I'd say his thoughts on having me killed
were abundantly clear.

265
00:20:24,008 --> 00:20:25,134
Is that why you killed him?

266
00:20:28,808 --> 00:20:31,618
Someday, if you decide not to execute me,

267
00:20:32,088 --> 00:20:34,375
I'll tell you all about
why I killed my father.

268
00:20:34,448 --> 00:20:36,849
And on that day, should it ever come,

269
00:20:37,808 --> 00:20:39,776
we'll need more wine than this.

270
00:20:42,168 --> 00:20:43,579
I know what my father was.

271
00:20:44,688 --> 00:20:46,133
What he did.

272
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:49,210
I know the Mad King earned his name.

273
00:20:52,368 --> 00:20:54,735
So, here we sit.

274
00:20:55,448 --> 00:20:58,179
Two terrible children of
two terrible fathers.

275
00:20:58,368 --> 00:20:59,938
I'm terrible?

276
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:01,339
I've heard stories.

277
00:21:02,008 --> 00:21:03,533
Why did you travel to the
far side of the world

278
00:21:03,608 --> 00:21:05,417
to meet someone terrible?

279
00:21:05,528 --> 00:21:07,451
To see if you were the
right kind of terrible.

280
00:21:07,528 --> 00:21:08,609
Which kind is that?

281
00:21:08,688 --> 00:21:11,658
The kind that prevents your people
from being even more so.

282
00:21:13,408 --> 00:21:15,376
Well, I did reopen the fighting pits.

283
00:21:15,448 --> 00:21:18,258
Under my rule, murder will once again
become entertainment.

284
00:21:18,328 --> 00:21:20,171
Yes, that was wise.

285
00:21:20,248 --> 00:21:23,411
And you agreed to marry someone you loathe
for the greater good.

286
00:21:23,488 --> 00:21:24,569
Very impressive.

287
00:21:26,408 --> 00:21:29,173
My own sister married someone
she loathed as well,

288
00:21:29,248 --> 00:21:30,409
though not by choice,

289
00:21:30,488 --> 00:21:33,617
and certainly not for the greater good,
gods forbid.

290
00:21:33,688 --> 00:21:35,099
She ended up having him killed.

291
00:21:37,288 --> 00:21:39,529
Perhaps it won't come to that.

292
00:21:47,008 --> 00:21:50,057
It's not impossible that Varys was right
about you after all.

293
00:21:50,168 --> 00:21:53,138
Varys? King Robert's spymaster?

294
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:55,734
Yes, he's the one who convinced me
to come find you.

295
00:21:57,128 --> 00:22:00,814
He was my traveling companion, before
Ser Jorah seized that role for himself.

296
00:22:00,888 --> 00:22:03,016
Jorah sent my secrets to Varys.

297
00:22:04,168 --> 00:22:07,411
For 20 years, the spider
oversaw the campaign to find and kill me.

298
00:22:07,488 --> 00:22:10,173
He did what he had to do to survive.

299
00:22:10,248 --> 00:22:13,331
He did a lot of other things as well,
things he didn't have to do.

300
00:22:13,408 --> 00:22:17,049
I suspect he's the main reason
you weren't slaughtered in your crib.

301
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:20,449
- But you trust him?
- Yes, oddly.

302
00:22:20,528 --> 00:22:23,418
He may be the only person
in the world I trust.

303
00:22:24,328 --> 00:22:25,818
Except my brother.

304
00:22:26,128 --> 00:22:28,176
The brother who killed my father?

305
00:22:28,808 --> 00:22:29,889
That's the one.

306
00:22:29,968 --> 00:22:31,857
Perhaps I will have you killed after all.

307
00:22:31,928 --> 00:22:33,453
Your queenly prerogative.

308
00:22:36,448 --> 00:22:38,098
I had given up on life

309
00:22:38,768 --> 00:22:41,612
until Varys convinced me
you might be worth living for.

310
00:22:42,328 --> 00:22:46,378
You chop off my head, well,
my final days were interesting.

311
00:22:53,008 --> 00:22:54,737
I'm not going to kill you.

312
00:22:57,128 --> 00:22:58,334
No?

313
00:22:58,968 --> 00:23:00,811
- Banish me?
- No.

314
00:23:01,528 --> 00:23:04,338
So if I'm not going to be murdered
and I'm not going to be banished...

315
00:23:04,408 --> 00:23:05,933
You're going to advise me.

316
00:23:07,768 --> 00:23:10,055
While you can still speak
in complete sentences.

317
00:23:14,448 --> 00:23:16,974
- Advise you on what?
- How to get what I want.

318
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:18,818
The Iron Throne.

00:23:20,528 --> 00:23:22,576
Perhaps you should try
wanting something else.

320
00:23:22,648 --> 00:23:25,254
If I want jokes, I'll get
myself a proper fool.

00:23:25,328 --> 00:23:27,330
I'm not entirely joking.

322

There's more to the world than Westeros.

323
00:23:30,248 --> 00:23:34,378
How many hundreds of thousands of lives
have you changed for the better here?

324
00:23:34,448 --> 00:23:37,930
Perhaps this is where you belong,
where you can do the most good.

325
00:23:40,328 --> 00:23:43,059
I fought so that no child
born into Slaver's Bay

326
00:23:43,128 --> 00:23:46,177
would ever know what it meant
to be bought or sold.

327
00:23:46,248 --> 00:23:49,138
I will continue that fight here and beyond.

328

But this is not my home.

329
00:23:51,728 --> 00:23:54,459
When you get back to your home,
who supports you?

330
00:23:54,528 --> 00:23:56,018
The common people.

331
00:23:56,088 --> 00:23:58,739
Let's be generous
and assume that's going to happen.

332
00:23:58,808 --> 00:24:00,936
Here in Slaver's Bay,
you had the support of the common people

333
00:24:01,008 --> 00:24:03,249
and only the common people.

334
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,375

is alive to support you.

The Starks are gone as well.
Our two terrible fathers saw to that.

339
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:20,409
The remaining members of House Lannister
will never back you, not ever.

340
00:24:20,688 --> 00:24:23,089
Stannis Baratheon won't back you, either.

And on and on it spins,
crushing those on the ground.

349

It's a beautiful dream, stopping the wheel.

You're not the first person
who's ever dreamt it.

351
00:24:51,408 --> 00:24:53,570
I'm not going to stop the wheel.

352
