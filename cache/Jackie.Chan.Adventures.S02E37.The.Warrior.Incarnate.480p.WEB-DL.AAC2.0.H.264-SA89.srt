1
00:00:02,602 --> 00:00:05,871
My Patience
wears thin, valmont.

2
00:00:05,873 --> 00:00:09,875
Every moment spent
imprisoned in this
stone casement

3
00:00:09,877 --> 00:00:11,877
is an eternity lost.

4
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:13,645
I assure you, shendu,

5
00:00:13,647 --> 00:00:16,515
my men are spending
every waking moment

6
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:18,584
searching
for your talismans.

7
00:00:18,586 --> 00:00:21,687
Aw, come on,
I wanna see
the baseball scores.

8
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:24,957
Uh-uh, not till I finish
checking out stuie kablooey.

9
00:00:24,959 --> 00:00:27,092
He's the bomb.

10
00:00:27,094 --> 00:00:30,929
You two. Come closer.

11
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,401
Show me the parchment.

12
00:00:35,403 --> 00:00:37,403
Are you a giants
fan, shendu?

13
00:00:37,405 --> 00:00:40,305
(Hisses)
Turn it over!

14
00:00:40,307 --> 00:00:42,174
The hair plugs ad?

15
00:00:42,176 --> 00:00:45,711
The statue of lo pei.

16
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:47,346
Ha, you wanna see lo pei?

17
00:00:47,348 --> 00:00:49,148
You ought to
check out my salary.

18
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:50,983
Get it? Low pay?

19
00:00:50,985 --> 00:00:54,019
Fools! Lo pei
was the warrior

20
00:00:54,021 --> 00:00:55,854
who scattered
my talismans

21
00:00:55,856 --> 00:00:57,790
to the 4 corners
of the earth

22
00:00:57,792 --> 00:01:00,926
and turned me
into a statue.

23
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:02,027
Well,
I guess somebody

24
00:01:02,029 --> 00:01:03,295
did the same
to him, huh?

25
00:01:03,297 --> 00:01:04,730
What goes around
comes around.

26
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:10,235
No, that is
simply a statue
made of terra cotta.

27
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:12,838
Whose leggings
Bear inscriptions.

28
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,643
(Hisses) Which may provide
precious clues

29
00:01:17,645 --> 00:01:21,313
as to the whereabouts
of the remaining talismans.

30
00:01:21,315 --> 00:01:24,583
Bring the terra cotta
warrior to me.

31
00:01:28,054 --> 00:01:30,722
Hurry, uncle. We're
on a very tight--

32
00:01:30,724 --> 00:01:33,192
ow!
The great wall
was not built in a day.

33
00:01:33,194 --> 00:01:36,428
Translations
are very tricky.

34
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:39,164
School to uncle's
in 3.5 minutes.
A new record!

35
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:40,666
And the crowd
goes wild.

36
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:43,802
No!

37
00:01:43,804 --> 00:01:44,903
Oh--

38
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:48,440
oh! What did you do?!

39
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:49,741
What did <i> you</i> do?

40
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:50,876
You put an old junk heap

41
00:01:50,878 --> 00:01:52,177
in the middle
of the floor.

42
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:55,013
That old junk heap
is a priceless
antiquity

43
00:01:55,015 --> 00:01:56,849
on loan
from the museum.

44
00:01:56,851 --> 00:01:59,885
Desecration of
a sacred artifact.

45
00:01:59,887 --> 00:02:02,154
This is very bad.

46
00:02:02,156 --> 00:02:04,890
It's just a crack.

47
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:09,228
Heh.

48
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:02,147
Ohh, broken statue.

49
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:03,215
Sorry.

50
00:03:03,217 --> 00:03:04,283
- Broken statue.
- Sorry.

51
00:03:04,285 --> 00:03:05,851
Broken statue.
Sorry.

52
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:10,088
Jasmine tea to
calm the nerves.

53
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,392
Yes, I can see my future
in the tea leaves.

54
00:03:13,394 --> 00:03:15,360
The museum
contacts the university,

55
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:17,696
my career winds up
like that statue.

56
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:19,031
Ruined. Ow!

57
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:21,400
Your career not important!

58
00:03:21,402 --> 00:03:24,069
Now, we will never read
the inscriptions.

59
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:27,005
Knowledge has been
lost forever.

60
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:28,707
Must call
my insurance agent.

61
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:29,875
See if I'm covered
for this.

62
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:30,943
Look.

63
00:03:30,945 --> 00:03:32,244
All we gotta do
is figure out

64
00:03:32,246 --> 00:03:33,378
which pieces go where.

65
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,480
Like a Jigsaw puzzle.

66
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,853
I'm just trying to help.

67
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:44,256
I think you've
helped enough already.

68
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:48,927
(Scoffs)
Think again.

69
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:52,431
"Statue of warrior
lo pei,

70
00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:55,133
ling dynasty,
wantoon region."

71
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:56,568
So where is it?

72
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:57,803
Someplace in China.

73
00:03:57,805 --> 00:03:59,738
I meant the statue.

74
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,573
Says here it's on loan...

75
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:04,042
To Jackie chan.

76
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:06,311
Jackie!

77
00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:07,613
Uncle.

78
00:04:07,615 --> 00:04:10,082
Broken statue
has disappeared.

79
00:04:10,084 --> 00:04:12,985
(Gasps) But how?
The dark hand?

80
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,621
(Gasp)
(Gasp)

81
00:04:15,623 --> 00:04:17,990
We know you
got the statue,
Jackson.

82
00:04:17,992 --> 00:04:19,124
Where is it?

83
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:21,627
It's missing.
Broken.

84
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:23,262
Broken.
Missing.

85
00:04:23,264 --> 00:04:25,530
You need to
get your story
straight.

86
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:29,534
Ok.
But first, tea.

87
00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:31,069
Huh, ooh, wha--whoo!

88
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:33,505
Ah-aah!
Yeeow!

89
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:35,874
Jackie! Tea pot
is antique!

90
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:40,245
Thank you.

91
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:52,057
Time to cut
to the chase, chan.

92
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:54,326
And I do mean cut.

93
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:05,871
Waaa?!

94
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,180
Jackie!

95
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:21,520
Waste of time, dudes.

96
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:23,188
Yeah. The statue's
not even here.

97
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,690
I got errands.

98
00:05:24,692 --> 00:05:26,325
So, if the dark hand

99
00:05:26,327 --> 00:05:28,293
did not take
the broken statue,

100
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:29,594
then who?

101
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:31,463
My little helper.

102
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,705
The healer.

103
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:46,178
Ok, humpty dumpty,
maybe all the king's horses

104
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,779
couldn't put you
back together again,

105
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:50,015
but he never
had one of these.

106
00:05:57,323 --> 00:05:58,457
Yes!

107
00:05:58,459 --> 00:06:00,125
Jackie will be stoked.

108
00:06:00,127 --> 00:06:02,027
Especially if I
help uncle figure out

109
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,462
what these chicken
scratches say

110
00:06:03,464 --> 00:06:05,163
about the talismans.

111
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:07,065
As if.

112
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:10,035
Why not get it right
from the horse's mouth?

113
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,075
Motion to the motionless.

114
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:19,010
Ok, rat,
do your thing.

115
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:25,217
Yes!

116
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,087
Where am I?

117
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:32,023
The real world.
Cool, huh?

118
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:34,393
Now, talismans
pop quiz time.

119
00:06:34,395 --> 00:06:37,129
Talismans? What do
you know of the--

120
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:39,498
the horse!

121
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,233
Yep. Used my
little pony here

122
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:43,502
to do a patch job
on your, uh, self.

123
00:06:43,504 --> 00:06:45,303
How can this be?

124
00:06:45,305 --> 00:06:48,206
As the dandelion
scatters its seeds
to the 4 winds,

125
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,442
so did I
scatter the talismans

126
00:06:50,444 --> 00:06:52,110
to the 4 corners
of the earth.

127
00:06:52,112 --> 00:06:54,513
That was then,
and this is section 13.

128
00:06:54,515 --> 00:06:56,081
Got a mess of 'em
right here,

129
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,516
safe and--
here?

130
00:06:57,518 --> 00:06:59,751
Well, not right here.

131
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,620
Downstairs in the, uh, vault.

132
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:02,821
Show me!

133
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:06,191
Uh, can't. You've
gotta have clearance to--

134
00:07:06,193 --> 00:07:07,926
oh, boy.

135
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:12,030
As the silkworm
senses the nearness
of the armored beetle,

136
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:14,699
I sense the talismans
are at hand.

137
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:15,934
Not even warm.

138
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,769
Oh, well. So close.

139
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:19,471
But you need a pass key.

140
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,175
Energy scroll.

141
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,382
Or one of those.

142
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:35,086
Some are missing.
Where is the dog?

143
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:37,722
The pig? The monkey?
The rat?

144
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:40,525
Uh, the rat's
closer than you think.

145
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:42,327
See, when I
brought you to life,

146
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:44,062
it kinda got stuck
inside your--

147
00:07:44,064 --> 00:07:46,298
(crash)

148
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,767
I must once again
safeguard these,

149
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:50,702
lest they fall
into the hands

150
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:52,370
of the ultimate evil.

151
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,485
Freeze!

152
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:08,253
Yes, you will.

153
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:10,522
Immobilizer scroll!

154
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:20,966
Hold your fire.

155
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:22,567
Watch out for the child.

156
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:24,669
Energy scroll.

157
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,621
Really.
I can explain.

158
00:08:42,623 --> 00:08:46,191
No need. The intruder
was obviously an emissary
of the dark hand,

159
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:48,093
utilizing a high-octane
nerve gas.

160
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:50,662
You were foolish to
try and stop him
on your own.

161
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:53,598
But also very brave.

162
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:57,035
Yeah, well, I try
to be of help.

163
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:59,938
Yes, and I wish
you would stop helping.

164
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,173
(Gasps)
The talismans! How?

165
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:04,376
Uh, you know
that broken statue?

166
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:06,945
Well, he's not
so broken anymore.

167
00:09:06,947 --> 00:09:08,213
Uh, what?!

168
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:10,448
Don't worry, Jackie.
I can help.

169
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,317
Oop, the "h" word.

170
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:15,320
I meant help
find the warrior,

171
00:09:15,322 --> 00:09:17,122
not help
do the laundry.

172
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:21,760
Sorry, miss. Orders.

173
00:09:21,762 --> 00:09:26,731
Ugh! "One cup per load.
Do not overuse."

174
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:29,200
Hmm.

175
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:32,637
Tour guide: Next stop,
the rock, a.K.A. Alcatraz.

176
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:35,173
Although no longer
in use, it was once
the most famous,

177
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:37,876
most impenetrable
prison in the world.

178
00:09:37,878 --> 00:09:39,678
Impenetrable.

179
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,113
Levitation scroll!

180
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:49,120
Whoa!
Call maintenance.

181
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:56,227
Uh, he looks like this.

182
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:59,230
Only he's not
a statue, right?

183
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:01,833
Tour guide: Though
originally built as
a civil war fort,

184
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:07,105
Alcatraz served as
a federal penitentiary
from 1934 through 1963,

185
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:09,708
housing some of
the world's most
notorious criminals,

186
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,610
including al Capone.

187
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:14,813
A worthy place to
secure the first
talisman.

188
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:15,947
Energy scroll!

189
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:19,985
Wait, please!

190
00:10:19,987 --> 00:10:21,987
Don't do that.

191
00:10:21,989 --> 00:10:23,321
Who are you?

192
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:25,790
I'm the one
who borrowed you
from the museum.

193
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,092
You need
to come home.

194
00:10:27,094 --> 00:10:29,928
And the talismans
need to be returned
to section 13,

195
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,863
out of reach
of the dark hand.

196
00:10:31,865 --> 00:10:33,698
I know nothing
of dark hands.

197
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,101
Only that the talismans
must remain hidden,

198
00:10:36,103 --> 00:10:39,204
lest they fall
into the hands
of the ultimate evil.

199
00:10:39,206 --> 00:10:41,239
The ultimate evil?
What is that?

200
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:44,442
You dare ask
a sacred warrior
to speak its name?

201
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:46,111
But you're
not a warrior.

202
00:10:46,113 --> 00:10:48,880
You're a statue.
Terra cotta. Uh--

203
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:50,081
(hollow clucking)

204
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,317
I-I-I'll prove it
to you.

205
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,653
Scroll magic.

206
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:57,656
Oof. Whoa!

207
00:10:57,658 --> 00:11:00,091
Actually,
<i>daily tribune.</i>

208
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:01,760
Ok, new plan.

209
00:11:01,762 --> 00:11:03,461
How about we
work together?

210
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:04,729
You know
the location

211
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:06,164
of the remaining
talismans, right?

212
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:09,167
Yes. And that is knowledge
you shall never possess.

213
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,002
Energy scroll!

214
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:13,271
Ooh!

215
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:14,406
Ah-ah-ah-oh.

216
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:21,946
Jackie.

217
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:25,183
Big city, small statue.

218
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:28,086
What's shendu think,
we're gonna see it
walkin' around?

219
00:11:28,088 --> 00:11:30,121
Don't know. But we got
a read on a talisman.

220
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:36,661
Whoa. It's the statue.

221
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:38,196
But he's moving.

222
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:41,132
Uh, don't usually
see that kind of
behavior in a statue.

223
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:44,502
Unless he's
packin' talisman, huh?

224
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:47,372
Guess the boss would
want us to confiscate it?

225
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,209
Yeah, but what
the boss don't know
can't hurt us.

226
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,277
I can dig it.

227
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:56,247
Ooh.

228
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:03,621
Aah!

229
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,392
Oh--

230
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:09,828
unh!

231
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:14,232
Finn: And he was
whuppin' chan
pretty good.

232
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:17,001
Rather ironic,
is it not, shendu?

233
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:20,138
A statue of the man
who turned you
into a statue

234
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,606
is no longer a--

235
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:22,974
silence!

236
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:26,177
So, lo pei has
become a living being.

237
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:28,179
Probably used
the talisman. Oof!

238
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:30,715
Lo pei possesses
a talisman,

239
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:34,018
and your men do nothing
to retrieve it?!

240
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,553
Big v, you should've
seen the guy.

241
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:36,654
He's packin' paper.

242
00:12:36,656 --> 00:12:37,756
Exploding kind.

243
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:38,823
We'd be toast.

244
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:40,525
You are expendable.

245
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:44,162
However,
the talismans are not.

246
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:48,199
You shall employ a weapon
more powerful than scrolls.

247
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:49,667
Cunning.

248
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:53,104
You will convince lo pei
you are his allies,

249
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:56,141
fellow warriors
of the ling dynasty.

250
00:12:56,143 --> 00:12:58,843
Uh, maybe you
haven't noticed,
shen-dude,

251
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:03,014
but we don't exactly
have that ancient
warrior look.

252
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:10,288
Hi. Remember me?

253
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,590
Out of my way, child.

254
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:14,793
Child?!
I released you.

255
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:17,028
You should be
calling me master,

256
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,429
and granting me wishes.

257
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:23,434
Look, I really
messed up,

258
00:13:23,436 --> 00:13:24,903
and I want to
make things right.

259
00:13:24,905 --> 00:13:27,739
How about we just
hop the number 4 bus
to section 13,

260
00:13:27,741 --> 00:13:29,307
return the talismans
to the vault?

261
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:30,475
No harm, no foul.

262
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:32,510
What do you say,
big guy?

263
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:35,446
What is this
strange gesture?

264
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:38,383
It means a-ok.
We're pals.

265
00:13:38,385 --> 00:13:41,953
The small one
is no pal.

266
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:47,892
She is the enemy,
o great lo pei.

267
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,195
You know my name?

268
00:13:50,197 --> 00:13:52,130
Sure. We're your homies.

269
00:13:52,132 --> 00:13:55,333
Talk flowery,
like shendu said.

270
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:59,037
I--I mean, uh,
fellow warriors
from the ling dynasty,

271
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:00,104
come to help.

272
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:05,510
As, uh, the dew helps
the morning glory
to blossom.

273
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:07,078
Oh, yeah.
That's us.

274
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,646
No way you're
buying this.

275
00:14:08,648 --> 00:14:12,550
The emperor
sent us to help you
hide the talisman--

276
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:15,320
talismans.

277
00:14:15,322 --> 00:14:18,623
You got so many,
he figures we can
do it faster and cheaper.

278
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,758
They are so lying.
They're the dark hand.

279
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,027
Bad guys. Enemies
of Jackie and me!

280
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:24,896
Yeah, lo pei,
you know Jackie.

281
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:26,464
The guy who was
trying to bust you up

282
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:27,532
back on Alcatraz.

283
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:28,933
He's her uncle.

284
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:32,904
Uh, by marriage.

285
00:14:32,906 --> 00:14:34,873
Hardly know him,
really. Heh.

286
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,774
As the Lily pad
offers respite

287
00:14:36,776 --> 00:14:38,276
to the weary
bullfrog,

288
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:41,646
so your service
to our cause is
much appreciated.

289
00:14:41,648 --> 00:14:44,148
No--unh.
Let go! Unh.

290
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,451
A sacred warrior
would never
harm a child.

291
00:14:46,453 --> 00:14:48,219
You are
impostors!

292
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:50,188
Yes.

293
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,190
(Gasps)
Look out!

294
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:54,392
Your cab's here.

295
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:55,994
Unh! Oh!

296
00:14:58,964 --> 00:15:00,398
Hey. Big tipper.

297
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,274
Unh!

298
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:15,480
Energy scroll.

299
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:18,283
Uh, uh, power up!

300
00:15:18,285 --> 00:15:20,551
Um,
abracadabra?

301
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,197
Lo pei:
Levitation scroll!

302
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:39,070
You're ok.

303
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:41,339
Yes, but I have no wound.

304
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:43,942
Well, that's 'cause
you're a statue.

305
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:46,511
Those false warriors
in the employ

306
00:15:46,513 --> 00:15:47,612
of the ultimate evil

307
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:50,248
now possess the talismans.

308
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,317
I have failed.

309
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,952
Wait. We can
get 'em back.

310
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:56,321
Where's that old
sacred warrior
spirit?

311
00:15:56,323 --> 00:15:58,323
Eye of the tiger.
Never say never.

312
00:15:58,325 --> 00:15:59,924
Hoo-ah!

313
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:06,264
Jade! No!
Don't hurt her.

314
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:09,334
It's ok, Jackie.
Me and lo pei are pals.

315
00:16:09,336 --> 00:16:12,003
Pals. A-ok.

316
00:16:12,005 --> 00:16:13,271
And the talismans?

317
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:15,773
Oh, those.

318
00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:18,409
Well, the dark hand
kinda got the drop on us,

319
00:16:18,411 --> 00:16:20,078
and...Eh, heh--

320
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,179
oh.

321
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:23,748
We'll get the talismans
back. Warriors, yes!

322
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,583
Warriors, no.

323
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:27,352
You are a child,

324
00:16:27,354 --> 00:16:29,153
and I am an archaeologist.

325
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:30,755
Er, though not for long

326
00:16:30,757 --> 00:16:33,391
if I don't get you
back to the museum.

327
00:16:33,393 --> 00:16:35,093
Again,
you speak nonsense.

328
00:16:35,095 --> 00:16:38,563
As the Crescent moon
is duty-bound to
follow the sunset,

329
00:16:38,565 --> 00:16:40,999
so shall I
smite this dark hand.

330
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:42,100
Hoo-ahh!

331
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:44,268
(Quietly)
Hoo-ahh?

332
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,471
It's an ancient warrior thing.

333
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,575
What is the meaning
of this?

334
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:57,915
Rooster, ox, bunny, horsey.

335
00:16:57,917 --> 00:16:59,817
We got the whole
kit 'n' caboodle.

336
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:02,687
Shendu: You failed
to mention the rat.

337
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:05,056
Uh, sorry,
big cheese, no rat.

338
00:17:05,058 --> 00:17:07,091
Honest.
We checked all his pockets.

339
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:11,329
(Hisses)
That is because lo pei
carries it within him,

340
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:13,297
you fools!

341
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:18,102
You will remove it
or face my wrath.

342
00:17:18,104 --> 00:17:21,005
How are we supposed
to get it from
inside the guy--

343
00:17:21,007 --> 00:17:23,441
bran flakes?

344
00:17:23,443 --> 00:17:25,476
You were
speaking the truth.

345
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:27,678
I am a statue.

346
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:31,082
But if this is true,
how--how can it be?

347
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:35,720
Motion to
the motionless.

348
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:37,688
Mmm...

349
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,724
The power of the rat.

350
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,327
Hey, come on.

351
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:44,996
Everybody
likes a statue.

352
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:50,802
The dark hand!

353
00:17:50,804 --> 00:17:53,471
Why? They have
all the talismans.

354
00:17:53,473 --> 00:17:54,739
No, they do not.

355
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:58,342
Duh.

356
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:02,313
Immobilizer scroll!

357
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,606
Go, lo.

358
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:39,417
Shadowkhan.

359
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:41,085
You must go.

360
00:18:41,087 --> 00:18:42,587
As the bamboo
stands firm

361
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:44,088
against
the furious hail,

362
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:45,923
so shall I
stave them off

363
00:18:45,925 --> 00:18:48,192
so long as
I am able.

364
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:50,761
I entrust you
to guard the talismans

365
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:54,098
and keep your world safe
from the ultimate evil.

366
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,334
I understand.
Thank you.

367
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,607
Good-bye, pal.

368
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:08,479
Energy scroll!

369
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:11,782
We can't just leave him.

370
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:13,251
You think I want to?

371
00:19:13,253 --> 00:19:16,220
He's on loan
from the museum
in my name.

372
00:19:16,222 --> 00:19:19,090
But we have to
secure the talismans.

373
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:57,261
The statue is
as good as new.

374
00:19:57,263 --> 00:19:58,596
Uh, I mean old.

375
00:19:58,598 --> 00:20:01,432
Better, even.
You need to
see this, Jade.

376
00:20:01,434 --> 00:20:02,567
Why?

377
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:05,670
(Gasps)

378
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:12,677
Hoo-ahh!

379
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:19,050
Man: Hey, Jackie.

380
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:20,117
Yes?

381
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:21,686
Do you collect anything?

382
00:20:21,688 --> 00:20:24,121
I collect a lot
of miniatures.

383
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:26,624
My secretary
put my little
picture inside.

384
00:20:26,626 --> 00:20:27,692
Did you see that?

385
00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:29,527
I was in Russia,

386
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:32,230
and there's a big lock
behind my shoulder pack.

387
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:34,098
When I'd walk,
it was like this.

388
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:37,468
Because it's, like,
really, really heavy.

389
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,003
I--right now,
I have more than

390
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:41,739
1,000 cup and saucers.

391
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,574
I'm a pretty funny person.

392
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:46,077
I collect a lot
of funny things.
