1
00:00:25,948 --> 00:00:26,907
Sir?

2
00:00:28,367 --> 00:00:31,578
The telephone recordings you requested.
From La Picota.

3
00:00:32,704 --> 00:00:33,664
Excuse me.

4
00:00:49,888 --> 00:00:51,515
<i>He killed the DEA rat.</i>

5
00:00:51,682 --> 00:00:53,934
<i>He's beating the shit
out of the North Valley.</i>

6
00:00:54,101 --> 00:00:55,352
<i>What do you want me to say?</i>

7
00:00:55,519 --> 00:00:58,397
<i>-Miguel's surprised us, brother.
-Look, Pacho,</i>

8
00:00:58,564 --> 00:01:01,567
<i>I'm proud too of how my brother's
handled things while I'm gone.</i>

9
00:01:02,859 --> 00:01:04,778
<i>But we all have limitations.</i>

10
00:01:04,945 --> 00:01:07,948
<i>I led our organization for 20 years,
always taking care of all of you.</i>

11
00:01:09,408 --> 00:01:12,411
<i>I know. But the thing is, I don't think
I'm ready to surrender, Gilberto.</i>

12
00:01:14,955 --> 00:01:17,708
<i>Besides, I still have to find the Salazars
and resolve the situation.</i>

13
00:01:17,874 --> 00:01:19,543
<i>There will be time for that, Pacho.</i>

14
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,462
<i>It is important to keep
a cool head right now.</i>

15
00:01:22,629 --> 00:01:24,089
<i>Until we finish the negotiations,</i>

16
00:01:24,256 --> 00:01:26,300
<i>it's necessary
that we are all on the same page.</i>

17
00:01:45,277 --> 00:01:46,778
<i>A fucking fridge?</i>

18
00:01:47,529 --> 00:01:49,573
A message from Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela.

19
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,242
Son of a bitch! What's that smell?

20
00:01:54,202 --> 00:01:56,413
The surveillance team we sent to Cali.

21
00:02:11,011 --> 00:02:14,014
Call me

22
00:05:55,902 --> 00:05:58,363
General, Miguel Rodriguez
is on the 7th floor.

23
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:01,533
His son, David,
doubled security after the raid,

24
00:06:02,868 --> 00:06:04,786
and, well, there's no way
to get inside that building

25
00:06:04,953 --> 00:06:06,413
without attracting attention.

26
00:06:06,788 --> 00:06:09,624
We have to get Miguel to move.

27
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:12,627
-And we capture him while they're moving.
-Exactly.

28
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:14,546
How?

29
00:06:15,797 --> 00:06:16,965
Leave that to me.

30
00:06:17,299 --> 00:06:21,303
I'll stay here in Bogota.
You coordinate the operation in Cali.

31
00:06:22,637 --> 00:06:23,930
But it has to be today.

32
00:06:24,097 --> 00:06:25,390
There's no time.

33
00:06:26,433 --> 00:06:27,434
Today.

34
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,443
Agent Peña, after our last operation,
my superior came to see me.

35
00:06:39,321 --> 00:06:42,324
He was very diplomatic, but he made sure
to remind me of all I've achieved.

36
00:06:45,493 --> 00:06:47,329
And that it could all be taken away.

37
00:06:48,997 --> 00:06:50,290
What worries me is that the only people

38
00:06:50,457 --> 00:06:52,876
who could do more damage to the country
than the cartel,

39
00:06:53,043 --> 00:06:55,295
are the sons of bitches they've bought.

40
00:06:55,462 --> 00:06:58,465
And I don't want to risk bringing Miguel
Rodriguez to jail through the front door

41
00:06:59,758 --> 00:07:01,801
so they can let him out the back,
you understand?

42
00:07:02,761 --> 00:07:03,762
General...

43
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:08,433
you put him in jail
and I'll make sure he stays there.

44
00:07:14,189 --> 00:07:15,106
All right.

45
00:07:15,523 --> 00:07:16,733
Let's do it.

46
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:20,278
Let's hope the bastard
enjoys his last day of freedom.

47
00:07:44,135 --> 00:07:47,889
All right, gentlemen,
Miguel is here in his apartment.

48
00:07:48,056 --> 00:07:50,100
Protected by a small army.

49
00:07:50,266 --> 00:07:53,770
Once I get the signal, I'll organize
a convoy and come down this way.

50
00:07:53,937 --> 00:07:55,730
Carrera 15, until we get here.

51
00:07:55,897 --> 00:07:59,401
There we will turn and go down 25th street
until Santa Rita.

52
00:08:00,193 --> 00:08:01,486
How many cars?

53
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:05,865
Four SUVs. I'll be in the first
and Miguel will be in the third.

54
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,037
I think that gives him an opportunity
to escape.

55
00:08:11,204 --> 00:08:13,415
I've got something
far more aggressive in mind.

56
00:08:14,165 --> 00:08:16,835
I don't want to give that son of a bitch
the opportunity to end up anywhere

57
00:08:17,002 --> 00:08:18,336
other than the back of my truck.

58
00:08:19,004 --> 00:08:22,507
You flush him out of the apartment,
and I'll take him down.

59
00:08:24,509 --> 00:08:26,636
<i>Sir, please believe me!</i>

60
00:08:26,803 --> 00:08:29,180
<i>I swear it on my family, sir.</i>

61
00:08:29,347 --> 00:08:31,808
<i>No! No, sir! Please wait!</i>

62
00:08:31,975 --> 00:08:34,269
<i>I already told you the truth, sir!</i>

63
00:08:38,106 --> 00:08:40,483
Play it again. From the beginning.

64
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:41,985
But what for?

65
00:08:42,694 --> 00:08:45,697
All you're going to hear is a man yelling
because he's being tortured, nothing more.

66
00:08:46,948 --> 00:08:50,076
I told you, maybe he said something
that will help us nail the motherfucker.

67
00:08:50,243 --> 00:08:51,828
But didn't we already catch the mole?

68
00:08:54,205 --> 00:08:55,832
I'm going to tell you something.

69
00:08:55,999 --> 00:08:59,210
I hate that motherfucker Salcedo
with all of my heart.

70
00:08:59,377 --> 00:09:01,713
But what's your problem with him?
He may be clean.

71
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:05,800
The problem I have with him is that
he's a fucking lying son of a bitch.

72
00:09:05,967 --> 00:09:06,926
And I know it.

73
00:09:07,552 --> 00:09:10,263
Now start it from the fucking beginning.

74
00:09:11,306 --> 00:09:12,307
You hear?

75
00:10:23,378 --> 00:10:25,672
Put all the clothes you want to take
on the bed.

76
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,050
Put any jewellery and valuables
under the clothes.

77
00:10:33,888 --> 00:10:36,224
Anyone comes in,
it will look like you just did the wash.

78
00:10:36,391 --> 00:10:39,853
When it's time,
put everything in the suitcases, okay?

79
00:10:40,478 --> 00:10:42,647
Good. One more thing.

80
00:10:44,023 --> 00:10:45,191
Come with me, please.

81
00:10:51,739 --> 00:10:53,616
Paola, don't freak out.

82
00:10:53,783 --> 00:10:56,953
-Wait, Jorge, wait.
-It's only a precaution, Paola.

83
00:11:00,248 --> 00:11:01,249
Wow.

84
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:02,667
My love.

85
00:11:03,626 --> 00:11:04,836
Take it, Paola.

86
00:11:07,922 --> 00:11:10,884
Like this. Hold on tight.

87
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:14,679
Here's the safety. Now it's ready...
and now it's not.

88
00:11:14,846 --> 00:11:17,348
That's the only thing you need to do.

89
00:11:18,057 --> 00:11:21,394
If anyone you don't know
comes through that door, use it.

90
00:11:22,353 --> 00:11:24,022
-Okay?
-Yes.

91
00:11:24,189 --> 00:11:25,523
My love, you can do this.

92
00:11:26,274 --> 00:11:27,901
You can do this.

93
00:11:34,949 --> 00:11:36,075
I'll leave it here.

94
00:11:42,999 --> 00:11:44,167
I can do this.

95
00:11:45,585 --> 00:11:47,337
It's my only choice.

96
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:50,924
As soon as the DEA gets here,
you go with them. You can't wait for me.

97
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:52,300
What about you?

98
00:11:53,051 --> 00:11:54,302
I'll be fine.

99
00:11:56,763 --> 00:11:57,597
Don't worry.

100
00:12:02,894 --> 00:12:05,939
Don't worry. Everything will be okay.

101
00:12:10,652 --> 00:12:12,737
<i>What I'm about to tell you
is a little delicate.</i>

102
00:12:12,904 --> 00:12:14,697
But it concerns all of our futures.

103
00:12:14,989 --> 00:12:17,283
I've been concerned about my brother,
Gilberto.

104
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:20,453
The thing is, he's been speaking to some
of our partners without telling me.

105
00:12:23,456 --> 00:12:25,124
Undermining me.

106
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:27,710
Making it very difficult
to run this business.

107
00:12:29,504 --> 00:12:30,922
So...

108
00:12:34,217 --> 00:12:37,637
I decided to have
my brother's phone tapped.

109
00:12:39,973 --> 00:12:42,183
What the fuck are you saying, Miguel?

110
00:12:43,142 --> 00:12:45,520
We don't tap each other's phones.

111
00:12:45,687 --> 00:12:46,813
I know.

112
00:12:47,563 --> 00:12:49,107
But in this case, it was necessary.

113
00:12:50,483 --> 00:12:54,153
I heard you two talking to him
about the surrender.

114
00:12:57,991 --> 00:12:59,867
And you heard something
I wasn't supposed to say or what?

115
00:13:00,034 --> 00:13:01,744
What is this shit, Miguel?

116
00:13:01,911 --> 00:13:03,913
Now we can't talk to Gilberto?

117
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,999
Of course you can.

118
00:13:06,165 --> 00:13:07,875
You're not going to make
a fucking speech now.

119
00:13:08,042 --> 00:13:11,045
No, I'm not going to make a speech,
but I will tell you one important thing.

120
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,843
The surrender was Gilberto's dream.
It was never ours.

121
00:13:19,053 --> 00:13:22,056
Besides, we all know
how good Gilberto is at promising things

122
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,310
when he wants something from us.

123
00:13:26,311 --> 00:13:27,812
What did he promise you?

124
00:13:29,063 --> 00:13:30,315
New York.

125
00:13:30,982 --> 00:13:33,818
But did he tell you when? How?

126
00:13:34,569 --> 00:13:35,820
You have shit.

127
00:13:39,157 --> 00:13:39,991
Chepe...

128
00:13:41,451 --> 00:13:44,454
here you have a passport,
a new social security number,

129
00:13:45,997 --> 00:13:48,833
and the addresses to two labs
in New York...

130
00:13:49,917 --> 00:13:52,503
so you can rebuild what's ours.

131
00:13:54,714 --> 00:13:56,257
And what did he promise you?

132
00:13:57,258 --> 00:13:58,259
The Salazars?

133
00:14:00,803 --> 00:14:03,598
Here's the location
where the Salazars are hiding.

134
00:14:04,682 --> 00:14:06,517
So you can avenge your brother.

135
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:20,782
Henao gave it to me.

136
00:14:21,574 --> 00:14:24,285
So the North Valley war is over or what?

137
00:14:25,745 --> 00:14:28,206
That's right. In our favour.

138
00:14:29,749 --> 00:14:32,752
Of course, first I had to send
that motherfucker a little gift.

139
00:14:41,886 --> 00:14:44,889
Look, Miguel...
I think you need to tell us the truth.

140
00:14:48,017 --> 00:14:49,644
No fucking lies.

141
00:14:50,686 --> 00:14:54,607
What the fuck have you done
with the real Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela?

142
00:14:58,736 --> 00:15:01,030
Surrender's for pussies.

143
00:15:23,719 --> 00:15:27,181
Listen up... Mr. Wiretap.

144
00:15:29,183 --> 00:15:31,436
Never ever touch my phone.

145
00:15:33,813 --> 00:15:35,064
Understood?

146
00:15:55,001 --> 00:15:56,294
Don Miguel.

147
00:15:58,963 --> 00:15:59,797
Sir.

148
00:16:02,258 --> 00:16:03,676
-What?
-Excuse me.

149
00:16:03,843 --> 00:16:06,262
I just heard DEA agents are back in Cali.

150
00:16:10,057 --> 00:16:11,684
Any update on the accountant?

151
00:16:12,894 --> 00:16:15,897
Well, we're still looking, but no luck.

152
00:16:33,831 --> 00:16:35,082
Motherfucker.

153
00:16:37,585 --> 00:16:40,338
This has to be the place
Enrique told us about.

154
00:16:46,385 --> 00:16:47,553
Look there.

155
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,181
See if you can find anything
about Salcedo.

156
00:16:56,229 --> 00:16:57,730
Motherfuckers.

157
00:16:58,773 --> 00:17:01,192
<i>I know this isn't the ideal situation
for you and your team,</i>

158
00:17:01,359 --> 00:17:03,152
but I appreciate your cooperation
with the transition.

159
00:17:03,319 --> 00:17:04,278
Of course.

160
00:17:04,445 --> 00:17:07,657
I'll put you in touch with the police
investigative team I've assigned.

161
00:17:08,157 --> 00:17:09,534
I'll give you the phone number.

162
00:17:20,336 --> 00:17:22,672
And they'll stop by for the files
this afternoon.

163
00:17:23,256 --> 00:17:24,173
Thank you.

164
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:27,176
One more thing, Minister.
It almost slipped my mind.

165
00:17:27,343 --> 00:17:28,135
What's that?

166
00:17:28,302 --> 00:17:31,305
I received some information regarding
Miguel Rodriguez's hideout.

167
00:17:33,808 --> 00:17:37,770
It seems he's in a building in Cali.
It's called Hacienda Buenos Aires.

168
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:41,148
Well done, Agent. Well done.

169
00:17:42,108 --> 00:17:44,110
I'll get this information to my men
right away.

170
00:17:44,277 --> 00:17:45,444
No, that won't be necessary.

171
00:17:45,611 --> 00:17:48,531
I've already got my men there
preparing for the raid today.

172
00:17:48,698 --> 00:17:50,116
Excuse me?

173
00:18:15,224 --> 00:18:16,225
Jorge?

174
00:18:16,851 --> 00:18:18,853
Don Miguel wants to see you right away.

175
00:18:19,103 --> 00:18:20,104
Coming.

176
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:24,317
Sir.

177
00:18:25,735 --> 00:18:28,112
Just got off the phone
with our friend in Bogotà.

178
00:18:28,904 --> 00:18:31,657
Seems those DEA agents
are here for a reason.

179
00:18:33,451 --> 00:18:35,119
He says they're planning a raid.

180
00:18:37,705 --> 00:18:39,540
We can take you to Santa Rita.

181
00:18:42,668 --> 00:18:45,129
-Do it.
-Of course, sir.

182
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,556
We got some news.

183
00:18:56,265 --> 00:18:57,224
<i>Get the cars ready.</i>

184
00:19:25,086 --> 00:19:26,045
Good morning.

185
00:19:26,212 --> 00:19:27,171
Hello.

186
00:19:32,677 --> 00:19:34,011
You seem happy.

187
00:19:37,765 --> 00:19:40,017
Defence Minister Fernando Botero...

188
00:19:42,395 --> 00:19:44,772
is working with the Cali cartel.

189
00:19:46,649 --> 00:19:49,527
-What makes you so sure?
-Played a little "telephone."

190
00:19:49,694 --> 00:19:53,698
Something I said to him that only I know
was repeated in Cali.

191
00:19:55,908 --> 00:19:58,285
Normally, I'd say you're crazy, but...

192
00:19:59,453 --> 00:20:01,372
I'm going to show you something.

193
00:20:06,085 --> 00:20:09,422
-Those Curacao bank files you gave me.
-Yes.

194
00:20:09,588 --> 00:20:11,882
I had a bank source help me
dig through them.

195
00:20:12,675 --> 00:20:13,467
And?

196
00:20:13,634 --> 00:20:17,054
What's interesting is who's listed
alongside Franklin Jurado's name

197
00:20:17,221 --> 00:20:18,139
on this account.

198
00:20:19,014 --> 00:20:21,684
Santiago Medina. Who's he?

199
00:20:21,851 --> 00:20:24,019
He's an art collector.

200
00:20:24,186 --> 00:20:27,648
But rumour is he does some money laundering
for upper class Colombians.

201
00:20:28,274 --> 00:20:31,235
Cleans their cash through fancy charities,
dummy corporations,

202
00:20:31,402 --> 00:20:33,612
campaign contributions.

203
00:20:34,989 --> 00:20:37,992
Guess who Santiago Medina worked with
on the last presidential campaign?

204
00:20:42,788 --> 00:20:44,206
Fernando Botero.

205
00:20:47,752 --> 00:20:48,586
There's nothing.

206
00:20:48,753 --> 00:20:51,589
Have you thought about the possibility
that Salcedo is telling the truth?

207
00:20:51,756 --> 00:20:54,341
Just because you don't like him doesn't
mean everything he says is bullshit.

208
00:20:54,508 --> 00:20:56,093
That's got nothing to do with it.

209
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:59,764
There's plenty of people I don't like
but still trust. Like you.

210
00:21:07,646 --> 00:21:09,482
Dario. You see that camera?

211
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:14,028
Maybe it caught something.

212
00:21:16,071 --> 00:21:16,989
Come on.

213
00:21:20,951 --> 00:21:22,870
I found this one from last week.

214
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:28,667
Play it.

215
00:21:34,173 --> 00:21:35,257
Fast forward.

216
00:21:36,008 --> 00:21:37,218
Faster.

217
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:41,514
Hit play.

218
00:21:43,182 --> 00:21:44,975
And stop... stop it there.

219
00:21:47,269 --> 00:21:50,105
See? These motherfuckers
must be the DEA, right?

220
00:21:51,899 --> 00:21:52,733
Keep going.

221
00:22:07,915 --> 00:22:08,958
His transport arrived.

222
00:22:14,713 --> 00:22:16,048
We're in position.

223
00:22:17,341 --> 00:22:18,801
I'll let you know when they come out.

224
00:22:36,485 --> 00:22:39,446
Despite how difficult this week has been,

225
00:22:39,613 --> 00:22:41,657
we're making it out of the storm.

226
00:22:42,074 --> 00:22:43,492
It would seem so, sir.

227
00:22:44,869 --> 00:22:47,538
I've been thinking about the promise
I made to you.

228
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:53,669
Six months...
until you open your security business.

229
00:22:57,172 --> 00:22:58,382
That's right, sir.

230
00:23:01,093 --> 00:23:03,721
It's even possible
that I'll invest in your business.

231
00:23:04,555 --> 00:23:06,056
What do you think about that?

232
00:23:06,223 --> 00:23:08,225
It would be an honour to have your support.

233
00:23:10,936 --> 00:23:12,563
Can I help you with your bag?

234
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:14,732
No, this is almost ready.

235
00:23:15,274 --> 00:23:17,526
Take those. I'll see you downstairs.

236
00:23:18,235 --> 00:23:19,194
Of course, sir.

237
00:23:23,157 --> 00:23:24,909
Keep going.

238
00:23:28,537 --> 00:23:29,455
Stop it there.

239
00:23:35,961 --> 00:23:38,380
No, that's Enrique. Keep going.

240
00:23:42,551 --> 00:23:43,844
Open it.

241
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:48,891
Salcedo is downstairs.
We're waiting for Miguel.

242
00:23:49,058 --> 00:23:50,017
<i>Copy that.</i>

243
00:23:53,646 --> 00:23:55,522
Stop. Go back.

244
00:23:55,898 --> 00:23:57,107
Go back.

245
00:23:57,691 --> 00:23:58,776
More.

246
00:23:59,234 --> 00:24:00,653
There.

247
00:24:04,698 --> 00:24:08,118
-Isn't that Enrique again?
-Can you get this shit to stop shaking?

248
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,761
Man...

249
00:24:27,096 --> 00:24:28,764
Man, you were right.

250
00:24:29,515 --> 00:24:30,849
You were right, man.

251
00:24:31,684 --> 00:24:33,936
I'm going to kill that motherfucker.

252
00:24:36,605 --> 00:24:37,564
Take this.

253
00:24:40,901 --> 00:24:42,027
Careful with this.

254
00:25:03,173 --> 00:25:04,675
Fuck, he's not answering.

255
00:25:25,654 --> 00:25:26,739
Here.

256
00:25:28,824 --> 00:25:29,700
Thank you.

257
00:25:33,328 --> 00:25:34,621
-Hello.
<i>-Dad.</i>

258
00:25:34,788 --> 00:25:35,956
It's him.

259
00:25:36,373 --> 00:25:38,333
It's that bastard, Salcedo.

260
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,128
David, again with this bullshit?
When will you stop?

261
00:25:41,295 --> 00:25:42,046
<i>Listen to me.</i>

262
00:25:42,212 --> 00:25:45,215
I found the DEA hideout. The one Enrique
told us Salcedo knew about.

263
00:25:45,382 --> 00:25:48,385
<i>And on the same street, there's a hotel
with a camera pointed towards the street.</i>

264
00:25:49,845 --> 00:25:53,640
We checked the video with Dario,
and we saw the DEA, Enrique,

265
00:25:53,807 --> 00:25:56,101
and that motherfucker Salcedo, Dad.

266
00:25:58,062 --> 00:25:59,396
Are you sure about that?

267
00:25:59,563 --> 00:26:02,274
One hundred percent. I checked the plates.

268
00:26:03,317 --> 00:26:04,693
Dad, think about it.

269
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:08,781
He's trying to take you out of a safe
place so they can catch you in the open.

270
00:26:09,406 --> 00:26:10,282
It's a trap, Dad.

271
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,161
<i>Dad...</i>

272
00:26:15,788 --> 00:26:16,955
I'll call you back.

273
00:26:28,675 --> 00:26:30,844
Jorge. Don Miguel asked me to tell you

274
00:26:31,011 --> 00:26:33,764
that he needs your help with something
before we leave.

275
00:26:37,768 --> 00:26:38,602
Jorge?

276
00:26:41,772 --> 00:26:42,606
Yes.

277
00:27:19,643 --> 00:27:21,812
NO SERVICE

278
00:27:47,671 --> 00:27:49,965
-Tell Serrano we're going in.
-Let's go.

279
00:27:50,424 --> 00:27:51,341
General!

280
00:27:51,508 --> 00:27:52,926
<i>We have to go in now! Out!</i>

281
00:28:04,021 --> 00:28:05,439
You need me, Don Miguel?

282
00:28:07,316 --> 00:28:08,400
Take a seat.

283
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,866
All right, but we should be going.

284
00:28:18,994 --> 00:28:22,873
I think we're going to be
a little safer here.

285
00:28:27,544 --> 00:28:29,838
You fucking son of a bitch!

286
00:28:30,005 --> 00:28:32,257
What is this? What's going on, Don Miguel?

287
00:28:35,969 --> 00:28:37,095
Don Miguel!

288
00:28:37,262 --> 00:28:39,306
Look how diligent! Very--

289
00:28:41,391 --> 00:28:44,228
Girls, whatever happens,
you don't leave the room, all right?

290
00:28:44,394 --> 00:28:46,772
-All right.
-Don't come out for any reason.

291
00:28:58,075 --> 00:28:59,117
Cover his mouth.

292
00:28:59,284 --> 00:29:00,327
Don Miguel!

293
00:29:01,203 --> 00:29:02,037
Please!

294
00:29:02,788 --> 00:29:03,622
Don Miguel!

295
00:29:14,383 --> 00:29:16,343
Go to your room.

296
00:29:40,867 --> 00:29:42,202
Let's go through the back.

297
00:29:55,465 --> 00:29:58,343
I believed you over my own son.

298
00:30:00,137 --> 00:30:02,264
You took my money.

299
00:30:03,181 --> 00:30:05,559
I let you protect my family.

300
00:30:07,602 --> 00:30:10,605
You listened to our private conversations,
you son of a bitch.

301
00:30:20,657 --> 00:30:22,576
I gave you all my trust.

302
00:30:22,909 --> 00:30:25,912
And what did it mean to you? Shit.

303
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:27,039
Nothing.

304
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:30,042
You're an animal.

305
00:30:31,501 --> 00:30:34,713
You're a little wharf rat.

306
00:30:35,047 --> 00:30:38,592
Not even that.
A rat has more dignity than you.

307
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:40,927
Do you know what I've just done,
motherfucker?

308
00:30:41,094 --> 00:30:44,222
I told David to go to your house...

309
00:30:45,432 --> 00:30:48,435
and kill your wife and daughters,
you motherfucker!

310
00:30:52,898 --> 00:30:54,232
Mrs. Salcedo.

311
00:31:02,032 --> 00:31:04,618
Ma'am, please open up.

312
00:31:05,202 --> 00:31:06,953
Girls, stop folding, please.

313
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,747
Back here. Go back here.

314
00:31:08,914 --> 00:31:10,665
Back! Here.

315
00:31:11,666 --> 00:31:13,960
I want to talk, Mrs. Salcedo. Open up.

316
00:31:37,734 --> 00:31:39,194
Keep shooting.

317
00:31:42,197 --> 00:31:44,533
I know you're in there, Mrs. Salcedo.

318
00:31:52,749 --> 00:31:55,460
Don Miguel! The DEA is in the building.

319
00:31:56,086 --> 00:31:57,546
Get Maria and the boy into a car.

320
00:31:57,712 --> 00:31:59,256
Sir, you should come as well.

321
00:31:59,423 --> 00:32:00,674
Get the fuck out of here!

322
00:32:36,334 --> 00:32:39,671
Give me that shit. Get out. Motherfucker!

323
00:32:47,804 --> 00:32:49,973
Fucking rat, die!

324
00:33:17,375 --> 00:33:18,376
Go!

325
00:33:42,192 --> 00:33:45,070
Don Miguel, we have to leave right now!

326
00:33:45,237 --> 00:33:47,864
Don Miguel! Don Miguel, no!

327
00:33:56,164 --> 00:33:58,625
-Don Miguel, we have to go!
-Kill him!

328
00:34:52,804 --> 00:34:54,180
Go out the other door.

329
00:34:57,142 --> 00:34:58,184
Hurry up, damn it!

330
00:35:51,821 --> 00:35:53,198
Miguel Rodriguez...

331
00:35:54,866 --> 00:35:56,284
you're under arrest.

332
00:36:12,884 --> 00:36:14,928
-General.
-Agent Peña.

333
00:36:15,595 --> 00:36:18,473
I've got Miguel Rodriguez, handcuffed,
at my side.

334
00:36:25,313 --> 00:36:26,523
And Salcedo?

335
00:36:35,115 --> 00:36:36,449
Get in.

336
00:36:39,994 --> 00:36:42,956
-Hello, my love. Are you all right?
<i>-Yes,</i> and <i>you?</i> The <i>girls?</i>

337
00:36:43,123 --> 00:36:46,126
Yes. Yes, the girls are all right.
They're scared, but all right.

338
00:36:48,169 --> 00:36:49,754
<i>We did it, Paola.</i>

339
00:36:50,046 --> 00:36:52,799
Yes. Yes, we did it.

340
00:36:52,966 --> 00:36:55,093
<i>I'll be with you soon, my love.</i>

341
00:37:10,817 --> 00:37:12,026
Got a minute?

342
00:37:15,155 --> 00:37:17,073
-We were wrong.
-Wrong?

343
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:20,827
Yes. I checked
the Samper campaign financials

344
00:37:20,994 --> 00:37:24,205
and I found that in July of last year,
they had serious losses.

345
00:37:24,372 --> 00:37:27,876
They needed money
for travel, ads, etcetera.

346
00:37:28,042 --> 00:37:29,627
And they got $6 million.

347
00:37:29,794 --> 00:37:32,672
Just happens to be the amount
Botero took from the cartel.

348
00:37:33,465 --> 00:37:34,507
So...

349
00:37:35,675 --> 00:37:37,802
-he wasn't laundering the money.
-No.

350
00:37:38,845 --> 00:37:41,014
That money stayed in the campaign.

351
00:37:41,723 --> 00:37:43,558
It was a contribution.

352
00:39:28,454 --> 00:39:30,665
<i>We've been talking, Mr. Rodriguez.</i>

353
00:39:30,832 --> 00:39:33,126
<i>There's a lot of interest on our part.</i>

354
00:39:33,293 --> 00:39:34,919
<i>If there's interest on your end...</i>

355
00:39:35,086 --> 00:39:36,796
<i>Yes. Of course.</i>

356
00:39:36,963 --> 00:39:37,881
POLICE

357
00:39:38,047 --> 00:39:41,050
<i>We would need to know what we would
be getting for our contribution.</i>

358
00:39:43,511 --> 00:39:44,304
<i>Of course.</i>

359
00:39:45,555 --> 00:39:48,558
<i>As you know, our goal is to reward
our supporters once we take office.</i>

360
00:39:51,352 --> 00:39:54,355
<i>The terms we discussed
are certainly reasonable.</i>

361
00:39:55,815 --> 00:39:58,484
<i>Then you have our support.</i>

362
00:39:58,651 --> 00:40:01,654
<i>-How would we organize the payments?
-We should get together and discuss it.</i>

363
00:41:37,917 --> 00:41:39,627
I know it's difficult.

364
00:41:41,921 --> 00:41:43,965
But you get used to being here.

365
00:41:47,719 --> 00:41:49,053
You bastard.

366
00:41:51,681 --> 00:41:52,849
Look, brother...

367
00:41:54,142 --> 00:41:56,602
let's put the past behind us.

368
00:41:58,229 --> 00:42:00,773
I know this isn't
what you wanted to hear...

369
00:42:01,482 --> 00:42:04,527
but, regardless, we are winning.

370
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:08,364
I don't know what the fuck we're winning,
Gilberto.

371
00:42:09,323 --> 00:42:12,368
By catching you, brother,
they did us a favour.

372
00:42:12,702 --> 00:42:15,246
Now Pacho and Chepe
have to turn themselves in.

373
00:42:15,413 --> 00:42:19,250
That's the only way
we'll be able to negotiate the terms.

374
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:23,963
Well, you better be right,
because I'm not staying in this shithole.

375
00:42:36,517 --> 00:42:37,852
I heard about Miguel.

376
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:51,699
I'm going to surrender.

377
00:42:53,034 --> 00:42:54,410
And Chepe too.

378
00:42:55,912 --> 00:42:58,998
But before that,
I have one last thing I have to finish.

379
00:43:23,523 --> 00:43:24,774
Gentlemen.

380
00:43:25,858 --> 00:43:29,320
Mr. Santacruz,
we have to ask you to come with us.

381
00:43:29,654 --> 00:43:31,155
You're under arrest.

382
00:43:32,406 --> 00:43:36,369
There's room at the bar.
Make yourself comfortable.

383
00:43:39,872 --> 00:43:43,835
Please, Mr. Santacruz.
You have to come with us.

384
00:43:45,419 --> 00:43:47,588
Who do you think called the police?

385
00:43:49,465 --> 00:43:51,050
Here's how this is gonna go.

386
00:43:52,301 --> 00:43:53,469
When I'm done...

387
00:43:53,928 --> 00:43:55,847
when I'm fucking ready...

388
00:43:57,014 --> 00:43:58,891
then you can give me a ride to jail.

389
00:43:59,684 --> 00:44:01,144
Take a seat.

390
00:44:01,894 --> 00:44:03,271
Eat this. Come on.

391
00:44:03,437 --> 00:44:04,939
Order whatever you want.

392
00:44:05,106 --> 00:44:06,149
Come on.
