Is your father's device ready?

the battery needs recharging.

the Godspeeds recover so fast,

It's like they got stronger
all of a sudden.

- Chester: I think I know how.

521
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:25,505
Okay, so the S.E.E. battery

522
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:28,175
needed 700 nanometers
of microwave energy

523
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:29,718
to power the device,

524
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,720
but the battery wasn't charged
by Allegra.

525
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:33,806
It was charged with...
- My lightning.

526
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:37,684
- Which was equivalent to
5 billion nanometers of energy.

527
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:40,271
- So Barry's lightning
supercharged the S.E.E.

528
00:24:40,313 --> 00:24:42,064
- Yeah, when the Godspeeds
were blasted,

529
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:44,650
they got a super dose of
your Speed Force energy too.

530
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:46,777
Barry, I am so sorry.

this coming, and I...

- No, man.
No.

533

You did everything right.
This is not your fault.

534
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:55,535
- Okay, so how long
until the next batch shows up?

535
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:57,204

But I'll see if I can get

What are you thinking?

540
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,550
- Even if we get
the S.E.E. working,

541
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:11,885
we're still outnumbered.

Not long.

I mean, just long enough
to hear that Dad

547
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:27,360
finally realized
that he should tag me in.

548
00:25:27,401 --> 00:25:28,861
- He meant me, dumbass.

- No, I didn't.
- Wait, what?

550
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:34,908
- Nora,
we almost died out there.

I couldn't protect you.

I'm not putting you
in that position again.

Mom, a little backup
here, please?

this war is unpredictable,

and it's getting
more dangerous.

Dangerous is, like,

- You don't
just get to decide that.

563

I'm about to turn 30.

That's not an option,
