1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:07,088
My name is Barry Allen
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,767
When I was a child, I saw my mother killed
by something impossible.

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,400
My father went to prison for her murder.

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,567
Then an accident
made me the impossible.

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,805
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist...

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,886
...but secretly, I use my speed to
fight crime and find others like me.

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,209
And one day, I'll find who killed my mother
and get justice for my father.

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,203
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,970
Previously on The Flash:

10
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,406
That's Barry's old house.

11
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,643
- It's been too long. Everything's different.
- Except that mirror.

12
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,407
This mirror might contain
photographs of what happened that night.

13
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,050
That blood belongs
to one of the speedsters that was here.

14
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,123
It's Barry's. As an adult.

15
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,647
- Mrs. Stein, have you seen this person?
- Yes.

16
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,131
He's not Ronnie anymore.

17
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,766
He's Martin Stein walking around
in Ronnie's body.

18
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,171
Any attempt we make to separate
the two of them could be catastrophic.

19
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,165
A nuclear explosion.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,074

21
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,650
Barf)'-

22
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,368
Barry, what happened out there?

23
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,681
Are you guys Okay?

24
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,289
- Are you okay?
- I think so.

25
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,482
I think so.

26
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,322
Oh, God. The nuclear explosion.

27
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,245
There's no telling how much radiation
we were exposed to.

28
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:41,367
Wait, wait. This can't be. The Geiger counter in
the suit, it's reading less than one millirad.

29
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,490
- But that's normal.
- There's no radiation.

30
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,770
Let's go.

31
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,727
Did it work?

32
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,409
- Did you separate them?
- I don't know.

33
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,769
Ronnie?

34
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,006
Tell me your name.

35
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,921
Ronnie Raymond.

36
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,970
Cait.

37
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,410
It's me.

38
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,561
Uh, pardon me.

39
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,721
Obviously, I need a change of clothes.

40
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,931
Nice to see you in the flesh again,
Professor Stein.

41
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,086
We're coming home.

42
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,920
All of us.

43
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:07,407
- Ronnie Raymond. Heh.
- Cisco. Heh.

44
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,161
Oh. Ha-ha-ha.

45
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,687
I missed you so much, man.

46
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,530
- I shouldn't have locked you in there.
- Hey. Don't.

47
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,889
Welcome back, Mr. Raymond.

48
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,930
Dr. Wells.
Caitlin told me what happened to you.

49
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,127
I'm so sorry.

50
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,089
I'm responsible for putting myself
in this chair.

51
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,811
You are responsible for my
still being alive. Thank you.

52
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,644
You said you'd bring him back and you did.
Thank you.

53
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,366
You're welcome.

54
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,925
Uh, excuse me.

55
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,731
Are we all planning to sing
"Kumbaya" next?

56
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,244
Professor Stein, I presume.

57
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,640
Harrison Wells.

58
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,561
Do you have somewhere I can freshen up
and get a change of clothes?

59
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,960
Of course.

60
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,242
Right this way, professor.

61
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,370
- General, are you getting this?
- Roger that, sergeant.

62
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,086
Sir, look at this.

63
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,845
Two imprints of impact.

64
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,240
Two imprints.

65
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,323
Two different people.

66
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,563
It's Firestorm. He's separated.

67
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,329
Your vitals appear to be normal...

68
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,530
...except you have a slight fever of 100.6.

69
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,286
- Cait, I'm fine. I promise.
- I know, but we just need to be...

70
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,680
Shh.

71
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,923
Yup. Just when I forgot how awkward it was
to walk in on you two.

72
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,048
You can get used to it again.

73
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,322
I did a full medical workup
on the professor.

74
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,882
It turns out that now that
he and Ronnie are separated...

75
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,050
...they no longer possess the ability
to harness nuclear energy.

76
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:40,444
Professor Stein, you seem to be running
a little hot as well.

77
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,965
Same as Ronnie, 100.6.

78
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,203
Hardly a sweat, Dr. Snow.
And hopefully now the only thing...

79
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,840
...Ronald and I have in common...
it's Ronnie.

80
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,891
- Mm.
- Hey. You're gonna miss being able to fly?

81
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,362
- Yeah, if I was the one holding the controller.
- Meaning?

82
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,206
Meaning you weren't
the most conscientious body-mate.

83
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,406
So you do not consider keeping you alive
to be conscientious?

84
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,040
Alive? We were living under a bridge
eating garbage.

85
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,562
I didn't determine it'd be my mind
that would dominate our existence...

86
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,803
...but thank God it was.

87
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:16,488
I could feel your fear and panic, emotions that
would have gotten us killed in that state.

88
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:20,326
You kept me buried down.
You kept me from her.

89
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,768
Which is likely why she's still alive.

90
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,925
I believe you and I have spent
quite enough time together.

91
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,923
- Yeah.
- I would like to go see my wife.

92
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,606
- Mr. Allen will take you.
- Thank you.

93
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,530
I need some pizza.

94
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,250
You got it.

95
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,571
I can't believe it. Uh, wait.

96
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,410
Uh...

97
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,605
What should I say?

98
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,121
I don't think
you're gonna have to say anything.

99
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,961
Clarissa.

100
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,249
I'm so sorry I put you through this.

101
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,401
Thank you.

102
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,326
Mr...

103
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,887
- Barry.
- Yeah.

104
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:24,204
Barry, I know I can be difficult...

105
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,283
...but thank you for bringing me home.

106
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,130
I'll see you soon, professor.

107
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,244
- ...seeing what could only be described...
- Hey.

108
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,767
- I left you three messages.
- I know. I'm sorry.

109
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,964
About the lack of communication
or that hole out in the badlands?

110
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,963
We're all fine. Thanks.

111
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,922
I wasn't calling about the explosion.

112
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,488
- I have to show you something.
- What?

113
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,367
It's smaller than I remember.

114
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,763
Yeah, it's because you're bigger.

115
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,723
- Have you been in here? I mean, recently?
- No.

116
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,362
I haven't been in this
house since that night.

117
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,004
Bar.

118
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,210
This mirror. Do you remember it?

119
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,441
Yeah. It belonged to my grandma.

120
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,449
How is it still here?

121
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,365
Just be glad it is.

122
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,086
Look...

123
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,643
...I don't fully know how
Cisco did it, but...

124
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,126
Did What?

125
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,527
Joe, what are we doing here?

126
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,410
Mom.

127
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,169
You can definitely see two very fast people
fighting around your mother.

128
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,322
Two speedsters.

129
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,841
You see that?

130
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,208
The blood?

131
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,170
Cisco and I had the DNA tested.

132
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,080
It's yours.

133
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,770
No, it's not. That's impossible.
I wasn't even downstairs yet.

134
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:32,448
No, Barry, not that you. This you.

135
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,090
Cisco had the samples analyzed...

136
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,085
...and the proteins in the blood
were that of an adult...

137
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,009
...not a child.

138
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,121
But that means...

139
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,521
The speedster trying to stop
the man in yellow...

140
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,682
ls the Flash.

141
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,723
That's me.

142
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,049
Time travel.

143
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:02,248
If the last five months have proven
anything, it's that anything can exist.

144
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,283
But to actually travel through time?

145
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,960
Well, the greatest minds
in human history...

146
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,970
...put their collective genius towards
solving that puzzle.

147
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,122
So is it possible?

148
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,130
Yes, it's possible.

149
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,482
But problematic. I mean...

150
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,770
...assuming you could create the conditions
necessary to take that journey...

151
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,571
...that journey would be fraught
with potential pitfalls.

152
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,291
Novikov principle of self-consistency
for example...

153
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,646
Wait, the what now?

154
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,201
If you travel back in time
to change something...

155
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,530
...then you end up being
the causal factor of that event.

156
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,762
- Like Terminator.
- Ah.

157
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,641
Or is time plastic? Is it mutable...

158
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,447
...whereby any changes to the continuum
could create an alternate timeline?

159
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,889
- Back to the Future.
- Oh.

160
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:50,648
- I saw that one too.
- "Doc Brown." Tremendous picture.

161
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,601
Right. So, what's the answer?

162
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,488
I might be a clever guy, but if you're
asking me to give you a theory...

163
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,803
...on how to travel through time,
I'm afraid I just can't do that.

164
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,531
There is someone else
you can talk to about this.

165
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,250
Danish?

166
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,766
Why do you have a blueprint
of the S.T.A.R. Labs' particle accelerator?

167
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,641
- Do you know anything about physics?
- Not a thing. Might as well be in Dothraki.

168
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,849
So, what more is there
with the S.T.A.R. Labs story?

169
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,364
The only new information is Wells admitted
he was warned of a potential disaster.

170
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,887
Yeah.

171
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,969
Why do you think he did that?

172
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,883
Because he's a good person?

173
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,201
- Is he?
- Yes.

174
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,724
He saved my friend's life.

175
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,487
He was struck by lightning
and Dr. Wells and his team kept him alive.

176
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,725
So your friend wouldn't need saving if Wells
hadn't zapped him in the first place.

177
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,564
- It was an accident.
- What if it wasn't?

178
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,887
So you think Harrison Wells wanted
the particle accelerator to explode?

179
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,406
- Why would he do that?
- Don't know what goes on in that building.

180
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,847
But I think you know some people who do.

181
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,004
I'm gonna investigate my friends
because you got me a Danish?

182
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,328
I think that you'll do it...

183
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:11,246
...because you really wanna know
what goes on inside that building.

184
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,927
Barf)'-

185
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,806
Mrs. Stein, I'm sorry to bother you here
but is Professor Stein here right now?

186
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,209
Well, after a year apart,
I'm not letting him out of my sight.

187
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,971
S.T.A.R. Labs did quite a few
tests on Martin, didn't they?

188
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,360
And they said he was fine?

189
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,929
Yeah. Why? Something wrong?

190
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,801
- He just seems a little different, is all.
- Different how?

191
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:46,048
He's been asking for pizza.
Martin despises pizza.

192
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,050
Is that the delivery man? Oh, Mr. Allen.

193
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,044
I suppose it's too much to hope
you moonlight as a pizza boy.

194
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,969
I am famished.

195
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,647
Okay.

196
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,246
- Aah!
- Oh.

197
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,680
Bravo.

198
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,166
Please, come in...

199
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,804
...Mr. Allen.

200
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,406
Uh, oh. Ahem.

201
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,686
What can I do for you?

202
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,043
I needed to talk to you about a paper
that you wrote 25 years ago...

203
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,890
...for the Oxford University Press?

204
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,687
I have written many papers for that
publication. Could you be more specific?

205
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,570
Time travel.

206
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,168
These are just a few of the random thoughts
I've had on the subject.

207
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,010
A few?

208
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,209
See, I believe that space-time...

209
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:37,201
...is a free-flowing highway
that intersects the physical world.

210
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,126
We live in the moments
between the on and off ramps.

211
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,283
Theoretically, to travel through time...

212
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,529
...one merely needs to find a way
onto the highway.

213
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:51,402
Okay. So you're saying that this is actually
possible, to travel into the future?

214
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,204
Undoubtedly.

215
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,691
What about the past?

216
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,966
Yes.

217
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,688
My own personal choice
would be the Chicago World's Fair, 1893.

218
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,402
I think Nikola Tesla and I,
we'd have some wonderful arguments.

219
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:09,128
What about you? Would you be interested
in taking a trip into history?

220
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,169
I think that I already have.

221
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,967
Professor, um...

222
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,407
...15 years ago, my mom was murdered...

223
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,561
...and we recently discovered
some evidence that...

224
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,566
...I was there that night,
and not just as a kid...

225
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,410
...but as an adult.

226
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:38,770
That must be a side effect
of your incredible speed.

227
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,404
In some future date,
you actually move so fast...

228
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,490
...that the resulting
kinetic energy buildup...

229
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:52,203
...smashes a hole
in the space-time continuum.

230
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,444
Ha! Ha, ha.

231
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,527
You seem disappointed by the prospect.

232
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,729
I mean, if I do...

233
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,005
...somehow make it back there
to that night, then...

234
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,689
...it means that I didn't save her.

235
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,400
My destiny is to fail.

236
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:23,049
The boomerang goes flying through
the Cortex, smashing everything...

237
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,720
...and Cisc0's all,
"My bad. This one's on me."

238
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,163
Ha, ha. Sounds like you had
some crazy times.

239
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,044
Yeah, we have.

240
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,403
- Are you ready for life to get back to normal?
- What do you mean?

241
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,246
I was thinking we could leave town...

242
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,646
...start fresh somewhere.

243
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,649
Our lives are here, my job is here.

244
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,689
Yeah, hunting metahumans.

245
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,690
There's more to it than that.

246
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,211
And it's dangerous.

247
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,689
It can be.

248
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:58,205
Look, I stayed at S.T.A.R. Labs
because I believed in Dr. Wells...

249
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,200
...but ever since Barry became the Flash...

250
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:06,246
...and we've been working
to keep the city safe...

251
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,011
...I found a new way to help people.

252
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,166
Look, Cait, I'm not mad at anyone.

253
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,443
Okay, I know the accelerator explosion
was an accident...

254
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,686
...but that building took a year of our
lives, I don't want it to take any more.

255
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,330
Do you guys need anything else?

256
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,727
- We're about to close up.
- I'm good.

257
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,081
Babe?

258
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,971
Ronnie, get down.

259
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,121
Get out of here.

260
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,891
- No, not without you.
- I'm right behind you. Go.

261
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,609
- Professor.
- Martin.

262
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,768
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.

263
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:51,725
I feel terrified. My heart is racing.

264
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,491
Ugh!

265
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,007
Hands in the air.

266
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,405
I think... I think Ronald is in trouble.

267
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,722
How could you know that?

268
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,486
Jitters. He needs help. Go.

269
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,485
Ronald Raymond.

270
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,729
The burning man himself.

271
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,441
Half of him, anyway.

272
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,010
- Who are you?
- General Wade Eiling, United States Army.

273
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,924
- What do you want?
- Firestorm.

274
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,721
It stings, doesn't it?

275
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,565
Ha, ha.
Had that one developed especially for you.

276
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,081
Micro fragments attracted
to kinetic energy.

277
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:59,402
Firestorm was tonight's main objective,
but getting you, that's just gravy.

278
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,407
- Unh!
- Get in.

279
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,168
Gentlemen, we are at war.

280
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,448
Hurry. Barry's wounds are starting to heal
with fragments under his skin.

281
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,041
It's just like that time
I stepped on a sea urchin.

282
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,247
Only much worse.

283
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,842
- Ugh! Just don't pee on me.
- You know that's a myth, right?

284
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,811
I'm so stupid.

285
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,487
Jason Rusch, who is helping Professor Stein
with his Firestorm research...

286
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:45,162
...he said that the Army took all of
Stein's material when he disappeared.

287
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,170
- I should have known it was General Eiling.
- Not your fault.

288
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,642
He thinks you hold the keys
to the ultimate human weapon, both of you.

289
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,845
Okay. Let's finish this. I gotta get to Stein's
house, Eiling's gonna be after him too.

290
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,968
- Stein's fine.
- How do you know?

291
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,281
He's right there.

292
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:04,687
I don't think Mr. Raymond and I
are as distinctive as we had hoped.

293
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,763
I'm still inside Ronald.

294
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,447
There has to be a better
way to phrase that.

295
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:14,810
Beta, alpha, theta, delta.
All your brain waves are perfectly in sync.

296
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,009
The chances of that happening
are next to impossible.

297
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,441
Impossible is just another Tuesday,
remember?

298
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,206
Yeah, but this is like
some Twilight Zone level stuff...

299
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,886
...and I know we have a guy
locked up in our basement...

300
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,009
...who can turn himself into poison gas.

301
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,447
- Wait, really?
- Dude, that was like week three.

302
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,889
Look, if this Eiling is as dangerous
as you say, then I need to warn Clarissa.

303
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:39,204
I promise, I can get Clarissa out of the
city in time, but we need you to stay here.

304
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,641
Professor, I need you to trust us.

305
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,004
Very well.

306
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,884
Hey. Are you okay?

307
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,964
Yeah.

308
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,401
Yeah, it's just not the S.T.A.R.
Labs I knew.

309
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,890
Ronnie, this isn't the world that you knew.

310
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,408
Tell me about it.

311
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,928
All right, here we are. Uh...

312
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:13,200
All right. You guys can stay down in Iris'
old room, it's kind of small, but...

313
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,925
H9)'-

314
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,606
- We have guests?
- Yeah, we do. I hope that's okay.

315
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,406
- Mi casa.
- This is Ronnie.

316
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,925
Nice to meet you.

317
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,251
Ronnie? The...?

318
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,563
- Dead fiancé.
- Right.

319
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,082
- Beer?
- Thanks.

320
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,083
Dad? Barry?

321
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,602
- Iris, hi.
- Hi.

322
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,371
What are you doing here?

323
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,723
Uh, it's Tuesday.
I was gonna make us dinner, remember?

324
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,246
- Yup.
- Yeah.

325
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,324
- Here, I'll help you. Got it.
- I knew you'd forget.

326
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,161
There's plenty for everyone.
Caitlin, what brings you by?

327
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:53,288
There is a gas leak in my apartment,
so Barry said that we could stay here.

328
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,250
Oh, that's sweet of him.
And, uh, who's this?

329
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,408
This is, uh...

330
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,282
- Her cousin.
- Sam.

331
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,444
Visiting from Coast City.

332
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,971
You look really familiar, Sam.

333
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,250
Yeah, I have one of those faces.

334
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,970
So, what's for dinner?

335
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,169
- Harrison.
- Wade.

336
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,882
I had a feeling you'd be wheeling by.

337
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,605
Tell me.

338
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,040
Are they still pulling needles
out of Barry Allen's hide?

339
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,811
Hmm.

340
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,447
I guess your sweet little Flash didn't want
Sergeant Sans Souci to die...

341
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,648
...looking into a mask.

342
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,330
Ugh!

343
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,001
I'm sorry. I didn't see him.

344
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,285
I don't know how Firestorm works.

345
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,126
Well, you may not know the how...

346
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,845
...but you know the who.

347
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,161
Both of them.

348
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,844
Thanks to you, it's the dawn of a new age,
Harrison.

349
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,041
The Cold War, the War On Terror...

350
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:12,808
...they'll seem like cavemen fighting with
sticks once those two freaks bind together.

351
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:19,086
Well, you know where to find me
when you come to the right decision.

352
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,369
And I know you will.

353
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,205
Because, after all,
you're the smartest guy I know.

354
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,569
Barr.

355
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,328
Should I have not shown you?

356
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,242
No, I had to know.

357
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,965
We have been through so much.

358
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,448
You have, all your life.

359
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,245
And you've been...

360
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,085
...so strong.

361
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,402
But I...

362
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,443
...am still your guardian.

363
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:08,441
And it's my job to guard you
not just physically...

364
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,166
...but from heartache.

365
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,881
I can't help but feel like
I just handed you a brand-new burden.

366
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,685
Yeah.

367
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,201
But it's our burden. Right?

368
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,885
Yeah.

369
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,321
- Hey, can I ask you something?
- Mm-hm.

370
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,927
How did you know that the blood
in the house belonged to me?

371
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,921
You would have had
to have tested it specifically.

372
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:44,562
Cisco tested it against everyone
who worked at S.T.A.R. Labs.

373
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,284
You wanted to know if it belonged to Wells?

374
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,285
Joe...

375
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:01,049
...Dr. Wells had nothing to do
with my mom's murder.

376
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,286
You believe that now?

377
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,205
Yeah.

378
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,122
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

379
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,487
Cheers.

380
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,287
Cheers.

381
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,168
- Delicious.
- Mm.

382
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,320
This is, uh, quite an impressive facility.

383
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,244
Well, it was.

384
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,003
Now it's just a shell, I'm afraid.

385
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,447
It must have been devastating seeing...

386
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,331
...your life's work fall to pieces
before your eyes.

387
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,889
It was, and yet...

388
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,687
...it was the exact same moment
your life's work came to fruition.

389
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,209
Ah, my life's work?

390
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:59,203
If living the last 14 months
as a conjoined metahuman...

391
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,967
...has taught me anything,
it's that my life's work...

392
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,841
...should have been being the best husband
I could to my wife.

393
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,284
Are you all right, Martin?

394
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,601
L-leh-

395
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,367
I apologize.

396
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,726
It's just...

397
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,451
...I feel a little light-headed.

398
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,730
- Are you okay?
- Um...

399
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,041
Yeah.

400
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:33,041
Yeah, I'm fine.
I just got a little dizzy for a second.

401
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,208
You want the secret to Firestorm.

402
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,369
He has it.

403
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,091
You see, Harrison?
We do work well together.

404
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,241
Oh, hey. You said you knew some of the
leftover scientists at the S.T.A.R. Lab.

405
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,927
- What about a Caitlin Snow, MD? Know her?
- Yeah, I know her. Why?

406
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:10,004
There was an incident in a local
coffee shop. She was there.

407
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,924
That's Jitters, I used to work there.

408
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,850
Is there anything you can't do?

409
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,608
Witnesses saw soldiers
shooting the place up.

410
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:23,088
So I contacted the Army's
media relations division and asked:

411
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:27,131
"Are soldiers permitted to operate like
that on U.S. soil?" Know what they told me?

412
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,611
Hooah.

413
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,809
Weird. Caitlin didn't mention anything
the last time I saw her.

414
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,810
Really? When and where was that?

415
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,802
Yeah, I mean, I'm sure
there's an explanation for all of this.

416
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,881
He didn't hurt you?

417
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,321
Barry, I told you, only my pride is hurt.

418
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,767
I'm not in the position
to take on armed soldiers.

419
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,249
- Where do you think Eiling took Stein?
- Some off-the-books military research facility.

420
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,643
- We have to get him back.
- Easy. Eiling has already demonstrated...

421
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,650
...he has the weaponry
to disable the Flash or worse.

422
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,161
Well, we can't let him
turn Stein into a weapon.

423
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,481
How do we find him?

424
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,607
What?

425
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,451
No abnormal brain activity.
All vitals steady.

426
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,120
You think Ronnie can feel
where they're keeping Stein?

427
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,283
Ronnie got dizzy
when soldiers grabbed Stein...

428
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,841
...and Stein developed
Ronnie's obsession with pizza.

429
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,525
I don't feel anything right now.

430
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,449
Just keep trying.

431
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,602
Whatever this is, it doesn't have a switch.

432
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:52,970
It's possible it's just some kind of
residual connection.

433
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,731
You know, a temporary link
to your time together.

434
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,531
Wait. I feel something.

435
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,409
I'm cold.

436
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,570
It's freezing in here.

437
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:10,481
My apologies.
It should warm up pretty quick.

438
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,010
I know what you want.

439
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:23,401
But my research was never intended
to be used as a weapon.

440
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,724
I joined the military
when I was 20 years old, professor.

441
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,729
My father had me convinced
that our greatest threat was the Soviets...

442
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,849
...our greatest fear nuclear war.

443
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,601
But then came terrorism.

444
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,003
And Ebola.

445
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,564
And now it's the age of Firestorm.

446
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,567
Soldiers enhanced by your project,
professor.

447
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:48,766
Soldiers who can generate energy blasts with
their bare hands. Soldiers who can fly.

448
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,402
I would gladly die...

449
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:55,247
...before I see my life's work
perverted in this way.

450
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,680
Good.

451
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,570
Because you will die, professor.

452
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,727
How soon I let that happen though,
is entirely up to you.

453
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,767
What's going on?

454
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,361
The last time I did this was to a gorilla.

455
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,966
- You're okay, man. We got you.
- What's happening to him?

456
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,204
Nothing's happening to him.

457
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,284
It's happening to Stein,
and Ronnie is feeling his pain.

458
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,091
I was wrong.

459
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,289
Their connection is not temporary,
it's only getting stronger.

460
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,881
Just try and hold on.

461
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,049
Water. Water.

462
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,644
My, my,

463
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:54,401
You show remarkable grit for a teacher.

464
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,010
I am impressed.

465
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,845
Why don't we let you catch your breath?

466
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,651
Think about how much more of this
you want to endure.

467
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,491
Hmm?

468
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,489
- Ronnie, no.
- Wait, Cait, wait.

469
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,007
- He's cutting himself.
- I know. Let him.

470
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,844
Huh.

471
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,963
Ronald.

472
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,881
Anything?

473
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,164
Nothing. Nothing, just...

474
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,330
Just cold, like a metal surface.

475
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,325
Pressure on and on and off.

476
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,449
Tap, tap-

477
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,564
Tap. Tap. Tap.

478
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,680
Tap, tap, tap.

479
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,683
- Morse code.
- I got this.

480
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:11,567
Same thing again. Tap, tap. Tap.

481
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,207
Tap, tap, tap.

482
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,089
- Twenty-seven.
- What does it mean?

483
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,531
Army bases. They sometimes go
by numbers like Area 51.

484
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:29,080
Facility 27 about 300 miles away.
It was shut down in 1961.

485
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:32,244
- That's where they're keeping Stein.
- And keeping the aliens too.

486
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,323
- I'm coming with you.
- No, you can't.

487
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,364
I'm connected to Stein. I have to go.

488
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:40,201
But did you ever stop to think why your
connection to him is growing stronger?

489
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,209
Maybe you're being drawn back together.

490
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,051
Maybe your proximity
will cause you to re-merge into one.

491
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,407
And what happens to me if he gets killed?

492
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,642
Cait, Barry was right.

493
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,450
The world's different now.

494
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,768
Look, I thought we could get away...

495
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,121
...start a new life.

496
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:01,089
A normal life together.
But there is no normal life for us.

497
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:04,449
You will always risk your life
to try and help people.

498
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:08,650
And I will always be the guy
that runs into that pipeline for you.

499
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,283
The quantum splicer.
It was used to separate you once.

500
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,886
Maybe it could be of use to keep you, you.

501
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,844
Thanks.

502
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,566
- Okay, let's go.
- Wait.

503
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,804
Come back.

504
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,809
All three of you.

505
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,804
Let's go.

506
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,486
Oh.

507
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,847
This place definitely
doesn't look too shady.

508
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,650
Stein's inside.

509
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,844
I can feel our connection growing stronger
like he's pulling me.

510
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,729
As I feared, the Firestorm matrix...

511
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,406
...is building toward
a proximity re-emergence.

512
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,490
Like all matter, it yearns to be whole.

513
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,168
If you two merge...

514
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,284
...we might not be able
to separate you again.

515
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,603
We isolated the Firestorm matrix
in the subject's cellular structure.

516
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,330
Excellent.

517
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:20,650
Professor Stein, I'm afraid
you have made a terrible assumption:

518
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,806
That I need you alive.

519
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:29,090
Eiling has a gun to Stein's head.
He's about to pull the trigger.

520
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,005
He's here.

521
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,764
Aah! Oh.

522
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,207
Whoa.
I never thought I'd be happy to see you.

523
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,964
- Likewise.
- Let's get out of here.

524
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,127
Aah!

525
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,567
Run!

526
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,086
Okay, come on. Come on.

527
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,963
Barry, I'm picking up some serious
PH numbers on your suit.

528
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,565
They hit me with some chemical.

529
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:13,008
It's a weaponized phosphorus.
Water or foam won't extinguish it.

530
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:17,246
But you can't burn in a vacuum.
So you need to create one.

531
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,489
Run, Barry. Run.

532
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,530
- We need to merge again.
- No.

533
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,887
- Cait, we're dead if we don't.
- Listen to me.

534
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:43,125
The last time you two combined,
you both fought it. This time, don't.

535
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:47,922
Accept the change. Accept the balance.
Accept each other.

536
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,890
Once more unto the breach, dear friend.

537
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,161
Cait...

538
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,563
...whatever happens, just remember...

539
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,683
...I'll always love you.

540
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,889
- Can you hear me, Ronald?
- Professor?

541
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,725
It appears we've merged properly
on this attempt.

542
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:24,327
Wells was right about balance
and accepting it. Behind you.

543
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,005
Ronald, there's more of them.

544
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:49,004
Eiling, this ends now.

545
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,925
Yes, it does. For both of you.

546
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,010
An ion grenade...

547
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,960
...bombarded your cellular structure with
enough ions to destabilize your matrix.

548
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:07,602
Mr. Raymond, Professor Stein,
you were both fine Americans.

549
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,681
Your country thanks you for your sacrifice.

550
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,281
That was a lot of running.

551
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,885
Ronnie.

552
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,206
- Home?
- Yeah.

553
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:52,211
I think it looks worse than it is.

554
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,242
Ronnie or Stein?

555
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,006
- It's me, Caitlin.
- Ahem. Excuse me.

556
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,925
- It's both of us. Somehow.
- She's quite lovely.

557
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,683
Acceptance is a powerful thing.

558
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,451
Powerful enough to reverse it?

559
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:12,689
- I'm game if you are, Mr. Raymond.
- We could try.

560
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:41,283
Oh. I think we're getting
the hang of this quite nicely.

561
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,645
It's okay.

562
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,643
I understand. You have to go.

563
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:02,803
- How'd you know?
- I'm connected to you too.

564
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,327
L-leh-

565
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,371
- Where will you go?
- Pittsburgh, maybe.

566
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:23,565
Professor Stein has a colleague he thinks
can help us learn more about our abilities.

567
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,245
We can help you here too.

568
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,365
Eiling's already breached S.T.A.R. Labs.
We need to stay one step ahead of him.

569
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,284
For all of us.

570
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,406
- I'm coming back.
- We'll have pizza.

571
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:46,484
- Godspeed, Mr. Allen.
- You too.

572
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,361
As per our earlier conversation...

573
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,365
...I believe in second chances.

574
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:55,604
You'll get yours. Give it time.

575
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,763
Ready, Ronald?

576
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,530
Please stop calling me that.

577
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,688
I'll see you soon.

578
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,805
We love you.

579
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:44,050
I had Ronnie, then I lost him. Then I found
him again, but he wasn't actually Ronnie.

580
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:48,046
Then I got him back,
but just for a day until I lost him again.

581
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:53,889
You guys are, like, 10 seasons of Ross and
Rachel but just, like, smushed into one year.

582
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,210
I am not heartbroken this time.

583
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,969
I love Ronnie. I always will.

584
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:07,444
But there's not this
devastating hole inside me.

585
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,246
I have a life and it's a good one.

586
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,205
Hey, guys.

587
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,930
- Iris, hi.
- Hi.

588
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,531
Where's your cousin?

589
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,171
- Uh, he went home.
- Oh.

590
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,526
Where was that again?

591
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,764
Uh, Midway.

592
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,129
Oh, I thought you said Coast City.

593
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:32,683
Uh, Midway via Coast City.
He moved around a lot.

594
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,968
Heh. That's always really hard.

595
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,968
- Yeah.
- All right, well, enjoy.

596
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,087
- Bye.
- See you.

597
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,969
Am I supposed to know what that means?

598
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:55,330
It means that I'm gonna help you figure out
what's going on at S.T.A.R. Labs.

599
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,721
I think our burning man used to work there.

600
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,489
- Hey.
- So why did you bring me here?

601
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,726
I don't know how and I don't know when...

602
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,651
...but one day soon,
I'm gonna be in this house again...

603
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,689
...15 years ago and I'm gonna fail...

604
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,680
...unless this time I don't.
What are you saying?

605
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:23,607
Knowing that I'm supposed to lose
gives me the advantage.

606
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:28,641
Those images are a lesson
in what not to do.

607
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,610
When I face off against
the man in yellow...

608
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,805
...I won't make the same mistake twice.

609
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,802
You're gonna change the past?

610
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,325
Joe...

611
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,642
...I'm gonna save my mom.

612
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,728
What...? What the hell was that?

613
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,289
- It's good to see you again, general.
- Who are you?

614
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,042
Who am I?

615
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,726
Harrison.

616
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:19,966
You're one of them.

617
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,720
Metahuman.

618
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,482
Yes, I am.

619
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:27,126
And I protect my own.

620
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,930
Who is that?

621
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,003
Now, that...

622
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,244
...is an old friend of ours.

623
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,562
General.

624
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:44,162
That voice. It's in my head.

625
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,927
- Dear God.
- Not God.

626
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,885
Grodd.

627
