968
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:37,936
you destroyed it.

969
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:39,187
You destroyed Nora's message.

970
00:40:39,229 --> 00:40:42,774
- An unfortunate side effect.

971
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:45,110
But I needed to discourage you.

972
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:46,569
- From doing what?

973
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:48,280
- Hoping.

974
00:40:48,321 --> 00:40:50,865
Your determination
is boundless, Flash...

975
00:40:50,907 --> 00:40:53,201
it is one
of your greatest qualities...

976
00:40:53,243 --> 00:40:55,536
but you cannot avoid
the coming Crisis.

977
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:57,747
- Barry has five years
before he vanishes.

978
00:40:57,789 --> 00:40:59,582
- No longer.

979
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:03,295
December 10, 2019.

980
00:41:03,336 --> 00:41:07,090
On that day,
he will answer the call

981
00:41:07,132 --> 00:41:09,508
and make
the ultimate sacrifice.

982
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,677
Soon...

983
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,554
this world will fight
for the fate

984
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:15,181
of all the known universes.

985
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:17,642
- I'm not gonna leave
my family.

986
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:19,727
There has to be a way
to stop what's coming.

987
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:22,147
- I am sorry,

988
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:23,856
but events have been set
into motion

989
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,817
that you cannot
possibly comprehend.

990
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:28,361
- I don't need
to understand them!

991
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:29,528
Just tell me what I can do.

992
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:32,615
- To survive?

993
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:34,575
You can't.

994
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:36,661
In order
for billions to survive

995
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:39,456
this coming Crisis,

996
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:42,417
the Flash must die.

997
00:41:42,459 --> 00:41:45,878
