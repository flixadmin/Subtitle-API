1
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:39,799
You work too hard.

2
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:42,798
Where is everyone?

3
00:01:42,919 --> 00:01:44,279
They refused to come in.

4
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:46,719
Why?

5
00:01:46,999 --> 00:01:48,719
It's Saturday.

6
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:52,159
Why did you come in?

7
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:53,279
I work too hard.

8
00:01:53,679 --> 00:01:54,919
It's boiling in here.

9
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,559
Eight milliroentgen. A leak?

10
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:12,599
No.

11
00:02:13,999 --> 00:02:16,239
It would've gone off before.
It's coming from outside.

12
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:17,999
The Americans?

13
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:58,319
Iodine-131.

14
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:02,559
It's not military.
It's uranium decay, U-235.

15
00:03:03,279 --> 00:03:04,239
Reactor fuel?

16
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:09,878
Ignalina. Maybe, uh,
240 kilometers away.

17
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:22,159
Yes, this is Ulana Khomyuk
with the Institute of Nuclear...

18
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:24,479
Looking for...

19
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,759
- All right, stay calm.
- Don't tell me to stay calm.

20
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:37,839
They're at four. It's not them.

21
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:39,439
Who's the next closest?

22
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:42,439
It's Chernobyl, but that's not
possible. They're 400 kilometers away.

23
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:44,759
That's too far
for eight milliroentgen.

24
00:03:44,839 --> 00:03:45,999
They'd have to be split open.

25
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:47,959
Maybe they know something.

26
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:57,839
-Iodine.
-Could it be a waste dump?

27
00:03:58,559 --> 00:03:59,519
No.

28
00:03:59,798 --> 00:04:01,318
We'd be seeing other isotopes.

29
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:03,599
Nuclear test? Uh...

30
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:05,438
New kind of bomb?

31
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,358
We'd have heard. That's what
half our people work on here.

32
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:13,839
Something with the space program
like a satellite or...

33
00:04:16,278 --> 00:04:17,399
No one's answering the phone.

34
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:39,199
Get everyone started on an IV.

35
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,239
We don't have enough.

36
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,079
-All the children, then.
-But we don't have enough!

37
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:43,158
As many as you can!

38
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,158
-Where's the old man?
-He's set up a burn ward in 16.

39
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:01,678
What are you doing? What is that?

40
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:04,079
Milk. It's milk.
Much better than water.

41
00:05:04,159 --> 00:05:05,479
No, no, no. Stop. Stop!

42
00:05:05,559 --> 00:05:06,519
What are you doing?

43
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:07,799
These are radiation burns!

44
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:09,439
Their clothes are contaminated!

45
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:11,398
Help me!

46
00:05:12,799 --> 00:05:13,759
Get it all off.

47
00:05:15,359 --> 00:05:16,999
We're taking it down to the basement.

48
00:05:20,038 --> 00:05:21,439
He was a firefighter from Chernobyl.

49
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:22,879
Can you stop pushing, please?

50
00:05:26,999 --> 00:05:28,039
We have our orders!

51
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:30,399
- Disperse!
- Hey, there! Get him!

52
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:34,399
Why are you
keeping us out here?

53
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:29,919
Professor Legasov?

54
00:06:30,838 --> 00:06:31,839
Oh, no, not yet.

55
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:34,638
They're finishing up some other
business. It'll be a few more minutes.

56
00:06:34,719 --> 00:06:35,719
Can I get you some tea?

57
00:06:35,799 --> 00:06:37,118
No, I'm fine. Thank you.

58
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,959
Would you care to read
Deputy Chairman Shcherbina's report

59
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:39,998
while you're waiting?

60
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:41,199
Certainly. Thank you.

61
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:40,399
All right, Professor.
They're ready.

62
00:07:42,118 --> 00:07:43,679
Professor Legasov?

63
00:08:08,119 --> 00:08:09,239
You have my support.

64
00:08:16,239 --> 00:08:18,078
Thank you all
for your duty to this commission.

65
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:21,039
We will begin with
Deputy Chairman Shcherbina's briefing,

66
00:08:21,118 --> 00:08:24,439
and then, we will discuss
next steps if necessary.

67
00:08:24,719 --> 00:08:26,519
Thank you,
comrade General Secretary.

68
00:08:26,598 --> 00:08:30,759
I'm pleased to report that
the situation in Chernobyl is stable.

69
00:08:30,838 --> 00:08:33,519
Military and civilian patrols
have secured the region,

70
00:08:33,598 --> 00:08:35,399
and Colonel General Pikalov,

71
00:08:36,079 --> 00:08:38,679
who commands troops specializing
in chemical hazards,

72
00:08:38,758 --> 00:08:40,519
has been dispatched to the plant.

73
00:08:40,838 --> 00:08:42,119
In terms of radiation,

74
00:08:42,198 --> 00:08:46,239
plant director Bryukhanov
reports no more than 3.6 roentgen.

75
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:49,078
I'm told it's the equivalent
of a chest X-ray.

76
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:51,599
So if you're overdue for a check-up...

77
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:53,959
- And foreign press?
- Totally unaware.

78
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:56,919
KGB First Deputy Chairman
Charkov assures me

79
00:08:56,998 --> 00:08:59,559
that we have successfully
protected our security interests.

80
00:09:00,119 --> 00:09:02,118
Good. Very good.

81
00:09:02,518 --> 00:09:04,759
Well, it seems like
it's well in hand, so...

82
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:08,518
If there's nothing else,
meeting adjourned.

83
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:10,718
No!

84
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:14,519
Pardon me?

85
00:09:15,518 --> 00:09:17,119
Uh, we can't adjourn.

86
00:09:17,718 --> 00:09:19,958
This is Professor Legasov
of the Kurchatov Institute.

87
00:09:20,358 --> 00:09:21,878
Professor, if you have any concerns,

88
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:23,679
feel free to address them
with me later.

89
00:09:23,758 --> 00:09:26,559
I can't. I am sorry. I'm so sorry.

90
00:09:27,478 --> 00:09:30,959
Page three, the section on casualties.
Uh...

91
00:09:31,878 --> 00:09:34,679
"A fireman was severely
burned on his hand

92
00:09:34,758 --> 00:09:36,999
"by a chunk of smooth, black mineral

93
00:09:37,078 --> 00:09:39,479
"on the ground,
outside the reactor building."

94
00:09:39,558 --> 00:09:41,318
Smooth, black mineral, graphite.

95
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:43,159
There's graphite on the ground.

96
00:09:45,998 --> 00:09:48,878
Well, there was a tank explosion.
There's debris.

97
00:09:49,238 --> 00:09:50,358
Of what importance that could be...

98
00:09:50,439 --> 00:09:53,879
There's only one place in the entire
facility where you will find graphite.

99
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:54,998
Inside the core.

100
00:09:55,079 --> 00:09:56,678
If there's graphite
on the ground outside,

101
00:09:56,759 --> 00:09:58,838
it means it wasn't
a control system tank that exploded.

102
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:01,119
It was the reactor core. It's open!

103
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:05,239
Um...

104
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:06,958
Comrade Shcherbina?

105
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,918
Comrade General Secretary,
I can assure you

106
00:10:08,998 --> 00:10:10,439
that Professor Legasov is mistaken.

107
00:10:10,999 --> 00:10:13,238
Bryukhanov reports that
the reactor core is intact.

108
00:10:13,398 --> 00:10:15,718
-And as for the radiation...
-Yes, 3.6 roentgen,

109
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:18,159
which, by the way, is not
the equivalent of one chest X-ray,

110
00:10:18,238 --> 00:10:20,438
but rather 400 chest X-rays.

111
00:10:20,518 --> 00:10:22,758
That number's been bothering me
for a different reason, though.

112
00:10:23,239 --> 00:10:26,438
It's also the maximum reading
on low-limit dosimeters.

113
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:28,518
They gave us the number they had.

114
00:10:29,318 --> 00:10:31,999
I think the true number
is much, much higher.

115
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:34,558
If I'm right, this fireman
was holding the equivalent

116
00:10:34,638 --> 00:10:36,998
of four million chest X-rays
in his hand.

117
00:10:37,079 --> 00:10:39,279
Professor Legasov, there's no place
for alarmist hysteria...

118
00:10:39,358 --> 00:10:40,759
It's not alarmist if it's a fact!

119
00:10:40,838 --> 00:10:43,119
Well, I don't hear any facts at all.

120
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:46,799
All I hear is a man I don't know

121
00:10:46,878 --> 00:10:49,839
engaging in conjecture
in direct contradiction

122
00:10:49,918 --> 00:10:51,838
to what has been reported
by party officials.

123
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:54,199
I'm, uh... I apologize.

124
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:57,119
I didn't mean, uh...

125
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:01,199
Please, may I express my concern

126
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:04,558
as calmly and as respectfully as I...

127
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:07,239
- Professor Legasov...
- Boris.

128
00:11:08,158 --> 00:11:09,159
I will allow it.

129
00:11:18,479 --> 00:11:19,758
Um...

130
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:23,478
An RBMK reactor

131
00:11:24,438 --> 00:11:27,918
uses uranium-235 as fuel.

132
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:32,838
Every atom of U-235 is like a bullet

133
00:11:33,478 --> 00:11:35,519
traveling at nearly
the speed of light,

134
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:37,839
penetrating everything in its path,

135
00:11:37,918 --> 00:11:39,918
woods, metal, concrete, flesh.

136
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,118
Every gram of U-235 holds

137
00:11:44,198 --> 00:11:47,039
over a billion trillion
of these bullets.

138
00:11:47,118 --> 00:11:48,598
That's in one gram.

139
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:51,559
Now, Chernobyl holds
over three million grams,

140
00:11:51,638 --> 00:11:53,039
and right now, it is on fire.

141
00:11:54,439 --> 00:11:58,399
Winds will carry radioactive particles
across the entire continent,

142
00:11:58,838 --> 00:12:00,358
rain will bring them down on us.

143
00:12:00,438 --> 00:12:03,438
That's three million
billion trillion bullets

144
00:12:03,518 --> 00:12:06,838
in the...
In the air we breathe,

145
00:12:07,238 --> 00:12:09,639
the water we drink, the food we eat.

146
00:12:12,119 --> 00:12:15,358
Most of these bullets
will not stop firing for 100 years.

147
00:12:16,398 --> 00:12:19,278
Some of them, not for 50,000 years.

148
00:12:19,558 --> 00:12:22,158
Yes, and this concern

149
00:12:23,239 --> 00:12:26,598
stems entirely from
the description of a rock?

150
00:12:31,118 --> 00:12:32,078
Yes.

151
00:12:34,638 --> 00:12:35,598
Hmm.

152
00:12:38,999 --> 00:12:39,959
Comrade Shcherbina...

153
00:12:41,558 --> 00:12:43,198
I want you to go to Chernobyl.

154
00:12:44,038 --> 00:12:45,918
You take a look at the reactor,
you personally,

155
00:12:46,158 --> 00:12:47,958
and you report directly back to me.

156
00:12:48,158 --> 00:12:50,318
A wise decision,
comrade General Secretary...

157
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:51,958
And take Professor Legasov with you.

158
00:12:53,598 --> 00:12:54,838
Uh...

159
00:12:55,158 --> 00:12:57,958
Forgive me, comrade
General Secretary, but I...

160
00:12:58,038 --> 00:12:59,918
Do you know how
a nuclear reactor works?

161
00:13:02,278 --> 00:13:03,559
- No.
- No.

162
00:13:03,638 --> 00:13:05,518
Well, then how will you know
what you're looking at?

163
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:07,958
Meeting adjourned.

164
00:14:05,318 --> 00:14:06,838
How does a nuclear reactor work?

165
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:09,078
- What?
- It's a simple question.

166
00:14:10,998 --> 00:14:12,798
It's hardly a simple answer.

167
00:14:12,878 --> 00:14:15,998
Of course, you presume
I'm too stupid to understand.

168
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:19,958
So I'll restate.
Tell me how a nuclear reactor works,

169
00:14:20,038 --> 00:14:22,478
or I'll have one of these soldiers
throw you out of the helicopter.

170
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:35,758
A nuclear reactor makes
electricity with steam.

171
00:14:36,278 --> 00:14:39,078
The steam turns a turbine
which generates electricity.

172
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:40,958
Where a typical power plant

173
00:14:41,479 --> 00:14:43,198
makes steam by burning coal,

174
00:14:43,558 --> 00:14:45,158
a nuclear plant...

175
00:14:50,478 --> 00:14:54,358
In a nuclear plant,
we use something called fission.

176
00:14:55,918 --> 00:15:00,398
We take an unstable element
like uranium-235,

177
00:15:01,118 --> 00:15:03,038
which has too many neutrons.

178
00:15:03,118 --> 00:15:04,958
-A neutron is, uh...
-The bullet.

179
00:15:07,238 --> 00:15:08,838
Yes, the bullet.

180
00:15:09,918 --> 00:15:12,638
So, bullets are flying off
of uranium.

181
00:15:12,718 --> 00:15:13,678
Now,

182
00:15:13,758 --> 00:15:18,198
if we put enough uranium atoms
close together,

183
00:15:19,038 --> 00:15:22,318
the bullets from one atom
will eventually strike another atom.

184
00:15:23,158 --> 00:15:26,078
The force of this impact
splits that atom apart,

185
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:29,118
releasing a tremendous
amount of energy, fission.

186
00:15:29,479 --> 00:15:31,998
-And the graphite?
-Ah... Yes.

187
00:15:32,318 --> 00:15:35,998
The neutrons are actually traveling
so fast, we call this "flux."

188
00:15:36,358 --> 00:15:38,758
It's relatively unlikely
that the uranium atoms

189
00:15:38,878 --> 00:15:40,078
will ever hit one another.

190
00:15:40,878 --> 00:15:45,358
In RBMK reactors, we surround
the fuel rods with graphite

191
00:15:45,438 --> 00:15:49,438
to moderate, slow down,
the neutron flux.

192
00:15:53,318 --> 00:15:54,318
Good.

193
00:15:55,238 --> 00:15:57,438
I know how a nuclear reactor works.

194
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:00,918
Now I don't need you.

195
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:21,718
Can you help me?
I need to find my husband.

196
00:16:21,798 --> 00:16:22,798
No. Not now.

197
00:16:27,078 --> 00:16:28,238
-Mikhail!
-Lyudmilla.

198
00:16:28,318 --> 00:16:29,878
Take her.

199
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:31,878
Take her away from here, please.

200
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:34,518
Get away from them!
You want to get sick? Go!

201
00:16:34,678 --> 00:16:35,918
Please take her, please take her.

202
00:16:35,998 --> 00:16:37,278
Please take her, please.

203
00:16:37,358 --> 00:16:39,398
Please! Please!

204
00:16:39,718 --> 00:16:41,238
Please take her!

205
00:16:45,158 --> 00:16:46,238
Um...

206
00:16:46,718 --> 00:16:49,198
Excuse me,
I am Vasily Ignatenko's wife.

207
00:16:49,518 --> 00:16:51,678
He's a fireman. Ignatenko.

208
00:16:53,358 --> 00:16:55,918
Ignatenko, Sixth Paramilitary
Fire and Rescue Unit.

209
00:16:55,998 --> 00:16:58,198
I need to find him. Please.

210
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:03,358
Ignatenko...

211
00:17:03,438 --> 00:17:05,558
He's being transported
by helicopter to Moscow.

212
00:17:06,038 --> 00:17:07,118
Hospital number six.

213
00:17:07,638 --> 00:17:09,638
Why, is he all right? Can I see him?

214
00:17:09,718 --> 00:17:11,038
You want to see him? Go to Moscow.

215
00:17:11,478 --> 00:17:13,078
But they're not letting us leave here.

216
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:17,358
Tell them Major Burov allows it.

217
00:17:19,518 --> 00:17:20,958
When are they taking him?

218
00:17:21,798 --> 00:17:22,758
Now.

219
00:17:52,398 --> 00:17:53,758
We're approaching the power plant.

220
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:01,038
What have they done?

221
00:18:02,758 --> 00:18:03,878
Can you see inside?

222
00:18:04,278 --> 00:18:05,438
I don't have to.

223
00:18:06,558 --> 00:18:09,278
Look. That's graphite on the roof.

224
00:18:09,358 --> 00:18:11,438
The whole building's been blown open.

225
00:18:11,518 --> 00:18:12,838
The core's exposed!

226
00:18:12,918 --> 00:18:14,718
I can't see how you can
tell that from here.

227
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:17,077
For God's sakes. Look at that glow!

228
00:18:17,678 --> 00:18:20,118
That's radiation ionizing the air!

229
00:18:20,318 --> 00:18:21,958
Well, if we can't see, we don't know.

230
00:18:22,198 --> 00:18:23,398
Get us directly over the building!

231
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:24,838
-Boris...
-Don't use my name!

232
00:18:24,918 --> 00:18:27,358
If we fly directly over an open
reactor, we'll be dead within a week!

233
00:18:27,438 --> 00:18:28,438
Dead!

234
00:18:29,878 --> 00:18:30,918
Sir?

235
00:18:30,998 --> 00:18:33,718
Get us over that building,
or I'll have you shot!

236
00:18:38,038 --> 00:18:39,878
If you fly directly over that core,
I promise you,

237
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:41,598
by tomorrow morning,
you'll be begging for that bullet.

238
00:19:28,278 --> 00:19:29,918
Perhaps if you came back another day.

239
00:19:34,998 --> 00:19:36,438
Just wonderful.

240
00:19:37,478 --> 00:19:38,998
Deputy Secretary Garanin.

241
00:19:40,158 --> 00:19:43,718
Ulana Khomyuk of the Byelorussian
Institute for Nuclear Energy.

242
00:19:43,878 --> 00:19:44,838
What a pleasure.

243
00:19:45,238 --> 00:19:47,278
-Let me introduce...
-I'm here about Chernobyl.

244
00:19:49,918 --> 00:19:51,078
Such a lovely time.

245
00:19:51,717 --> 00:19:53,878
- Visit again, soon.
- I will. Thank you.

246
00:20:06,278 --> 00:20:08,918
I must tell you,
this is why no one likes scientists.

247
00:20:09,677 --> 00:20:11,678
When we have a disease to cure,
where are they?

248
00:20:11,998 --> 00:20:15,238
In a lab, noses in their books,
and so Grandma dies.

249
00:20:15,838 --> 00:20:18,238
But when there isn't a problem,
they're everywhere, spreading fear.

250
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:19,678
I know about Chernobyl.

251
00:20:19,758 --> 00:20:20,878
Oh?

252
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:23,677
I know that the core is either
partially or completely exposed.

253
00:20:23,758 --> 00:20:25,997
-Whatever that means.
-And that if you don't immediately

254
00:20:26,078 --> 00:20:28,678
issue iodine tablets
and then evacuate this city,

255
00:20:28,757 --> 00:20:30,918
hundreds of thousands of people
are going to get cancer,

256
00:20:31,318 --> 00:20:32,997
and God knows how many more will die.

257
00:20:33,518 --> 00:20:34,517
Yes, very good.

258
00:20:35,278 --> 00:20:37,318
There has been
an accident at Chernobyl,

259
00:20:37,397 --> 00:20:39,118
but I've been assured
there is no problem.

260
00:20:39,437 --> 00:20:40,878
I'm telling you that there is.

261
00:20:41,398 --> 00:20:42,958
I prefer my opinion to yours.

262
00:20:43,718 --> 00:20:45,438
I'm a nuclear physicist.

263
00:20:46,638 --> 00:20:49,518
Before you were Deputy Secretary,
you worked in a shoe factory.

264
00:20:50,957 --> 00:20:53,478
Yes, I worked in a shoe factory.

265
00:20:55,238 --> 00:20:56,437
And now, I'm in charge.

266
00:20:59,438 --> 00:21:00,878
"To the workers of the world."

267
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:27,478
Stable iodine will keep your thyroid
from absorbing radioactive iodine.

268
00:21:28,918 --> 00:21:30,918
Take one a day
for as long as they last.

269
00:21:31,678 --> 00:21:32,758
And go east.

270
00:21:33,678 --> 00:21:35,238
Get as far from Minsk as you can.

271
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:09,078
It's overkill.

272
00:22:09,598 --> 00:22:11,638
Pikalov's showing off
to make us look bad.

273
00:22:11,718 --> 00:22:13,677
It doesn't matter how it looks.

274
00:22:14,438 --> 00:22:16,158
Shcherbina is a pure bureaucrat,

275
00:22:16,718 --> 00:22:18,638
as stupid as he is pigheaded.

276
00:22:19,157 --> 00:22:21,038
We'll tell him the truth
in the simplest terms possible.

277
00:22:21,118 --> 00:22:22,278
We'll be fine.

278
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:26,638
Pikalov!

279
00:22:51,958 --> 00:22:54,517
Comrade Shcherbina,
Chief Engineer Fomin,

280
00:22:54,598 --> 00:22:57,677
Colonel General Pikalov and I
are honored at your arrival.

281
00:22:57,758 --> 00:22:59,038
Deeply, deeply honored.

282
00:22:59,317 --> 00:23:02,158
Naturally, we regret
the circumstances of your visit,

283
00:23:02,237 --> 00:23:04,198
but, as you can see,
we are making excellent progress

284
00:23:04,277 --> 00:23:05,797
in containing the damage.

285
00:23:05,878 --> 00:23:10,678
We have begun our own inquiry
into the cause of the accident,

286
00:23:10,758 --> 00:23:13,678
and I have a list of individuals

287
00:23:13,757 --> 00:23:15,917
who we believe are accountable.

288
00:23:37,877 --> 00:23:39,237
Professor Legasov, I understand

289
00:23:39,318 --> 00:23:41,518
you've been saying dangerous things.

290
00:23:41,597 --> 00:23:42,918
Very dangerous things.

291
00:23:43,278 --> 00:23:45,118
Apparently, our reactor core exploded.

292
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:49,878
Please, tell me how
an RBMK reactor core explodes.

293
00:23:52,157 --> 00:23:54,118
I'm not prepared to explain it
at this time.

294
00:23:54,838 --> 00:23:57,118
As I presumed, he has no answer.

295
00:23:57,197 --> 00:23:59,397
It's disgraceful, really.

296
00:24:00,237 --> 00:24:02,717
To spread disinformation
at a time like this.

297
00:24:08,958 --> 00:24:11,197
Why did I see graphite on the roof?

298
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:13,677
Graphite is only found in the core,

299
00:24:13,758 --> 00:24:16,557
where it's used as
a neutron flux moderator.

300
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:18,037
Correct?

301
00:24:19,317 --> 00:24:22,717
Fomin, why did the Deputy Chairman
see graphite on the roof?

302
00:24:23,758 --> 00:24:25,077
Well, that can't be.

303
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:28,958
Comrade Shcherbina,
my apologies, but graphite...

304
00:24:29,157 --> 00:24:30,157
That's not possible.

305
00:24:30,318 --> 00:24:32,317
Perhaps you saw burnt concrete.

306
00:24:32,398 --> 00:24:33,677
Now there you made a mistake,

307
00:24:34,277 --> 00:24:36,597
because I may not know much
about nuclear reactors,

308
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:38,278
but I know a lot about concrete.

309
00:24:39,197 --> 00:24:41,478
-Comrade, I assure you...
-I understand.

310
00:24:42,317 --> 00:24:43,918
You think Legasov is wrong?

311
00:24:45,118 --> 00:24:46,278
How shall we prove it?

312
00:24:48,198 --> 00:24:50,277
Our high-range dosimeter just arrived.

313
00:24:51,358 --> 00:24:53,477
We could cover one of our trucks
with lead shielding,

314
00:24:54,277 --> 00:24:55,838
mount the dosimeter on the front.

315
00:25:02,117 --> 00:25:04,677
Have one of your men
get as close to the fire as he can.

316
00:25:05,318 --> 00:25:06,917
Give him every bit
of protection you have.

317
00:25:06,997 --> 00:25:10,358
But understand that even with
lead shielding, it may not be enough.

318
00:25:12,757 --> 00:25:13,877
Then I'll do it myself.

319
00:25:19,117 --> 00:25:20,077
Good.

320
00:27:13,958 --> 00:27:14,957
He's back.

321
00:27:43,477 --> 00:27:44,597
It's not three roentgen.

322
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:46,357
It's 15,000.

323
00:27:47,677 --> 00:27:48,918
Comrade Shcherbina...

324
00:27:50,038 --> 00:27:51,477
What does that number mean?

325
00:27:51,558 --> 00:27:53,397
It means the core is open.

326
00:27:54,077 --> 00:27:56,117
It means the fire
we're watching with our own eyes

327
00:27:56,198 --> 00:27:57,677
is giving off nearly
twice the radiation

328
00:27:57,757 --> 00:27:59,437
released by the bomb in Hiroshima.

329
00:27:59,518 --> 00:28:01,278
And that's every single hour.

330
00:28:01,357 --> 00:28:04,197
Hour after hour,
20 hours since the explosion,

331
00:28:04,278 --> 00:28:05,837
so 40 bombs' worth by now.

332
00:28:06,078 --> 00:28:07,198
Forty-eight more tomorrow.

333
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:09,918
And it will not stop.
Not in a week, not in a month.

334
00:28:09,997 --> 00:28:11,477
It will burn and spread its poison

335
00:28:11,558 --> 00:28:13,557
until the entire continent is dead.

336
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:19,357
Please escort Comrades
Bryukhanov and Fomin

337
00:28:19,437 --> 00:28:20,917
to the local party headquarters.

338
00:28:21,718 --> 00:28:23,117
-Thank you for your service.
-Comrade...

339
00:28:23,197 --> 00:28:24,318
You're excused.

340
00:28:25,158 --> 00:28:26,717
Dyatlov was in charge.

341
00:28:28,277 --> 00:28:29,518
It was Dyatlov!

342
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:32,437
-Tell me how to put it out.
-We'll use helicopters.

343
00:28:32,678 --> 00:28:34,198
We'll drop water on it
like a forest fire.

344
00:28:34,277 --> 00:28:36,877
No, no, no. You don't understand.
This isn't a fire.

345
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:41,517
This is a fissioning reactor core
burning at over 2,000 degrees.

346
00:28:41,598 --> 00:28:43,238
The heat will instantly
vaporize the water...

347
00:28:43,317 --> 00:28:44,478
How do we put it out?

348
00:28:47,597 --> 00:28:49,517
You are dealing with something

349
00:28:49,597 --> 00:28:53,357
that has never occurred
on this planet before.

350
00:28:55,757 --> 00:28:56,717
Boron.

351
00:28:58,198 --> 00:28:59,597
Boron and sand.

352
00:29:00,477 --> 00:29:02,917
Well, that'll create problems
of its own,

353
00:29:02,998 --> 00:29:04,638
but I don't see any other way.

354
00:29:05,357 --> 00:29:07,077
Of course, it's going to take
thousands of drops,

355
00:29:07,157 --> 00:29:09,637
because you can't fly the helicopters
directly over the core,

356
00:29:09,718 --> 00:29:11,238
so most of it is going to miss.

357
00:29:11,317 --> 00:29:13,397
-How much sand and boron?
-Well, I can't be...

358
00:29:13,477 --> 00:29:16,677
-For God's sake, roughly!
-Five thousand tons.

359
00:29:17,437 --> 00:29:20,077
And obviously, we're going to need
to evacuate an enormous area...

360
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:21,717
Never mind that. Focus on the fire.

361
00:29:21,798 --> 00:29:23,757
I am focusing on the fire.

362
00:29:24,357 --> 00:29:27,597
The wind,
it's carrying all that smoke.

363
00:29:28,597 --> 00:29:30,077
All that radiation.

364
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:33,197
At least evacuate Pripyat.
It's three kilometers away.

365
00:29:33,277 --> 00:29:35,238
-That's my decision to make.
-Then make it.

366
00:29:35,317 --> 00:29:37,917
-I've been told not to.
-Is it or is not your decision?

367
00:29:37,997 --> 00:29:39,117
I'm in charge here!

368
00:29:39,717 --> 00:29:41,278
This will go much easier
if you talk to me

369
00:29:41,357 --> 00:29:42,597
about the things you do understand

370
00:29:42,677 --> 00:29:44,677
and not about the things
you do not understand.

371
00:29:48,997 --> 00:29:50,237
Where are you going?

372
00:29:50,318 --> 00:29:53,397
I'm going to get you
5,000 tons of sand and boron.

373
00:30:01,517 --> 00:30:02,717
There's a hotel.

374
00:30:57,118 --> 00:30:58,317
I'd prefer one of those.

375
00:31:06,757 --> 00:31:08,277
Superstitious?

376
00:31:16,998 --> 00:31:18,638
Moscow?

377
00:31:21,997 --> 00:31:23,797
Are you here because of the fire?

378
00:31:28,477 --> 00:31:30,797
Anything we should be worried about?

379
00:31:35,837 --> 00:31:36,837
No.

380
00:32:39,677 --> 00:32:42,157
We're in position.
Approaching drop.

381
00:32:43,437 --> 00:32:44,717
Clear to proceed.

382
00:32:46,597 --> 00:32:49,677
Copy.
We'll go one by one in rotation.

383
00:32:54,637 --> 00:32:56,357
Remind them about the perimeter.

384
00:32:59,957 --> 00:33:01,997
They cannot fly
directly over the fire.

385
00:33:02,077 --> 00:33:04,397
A minimum of a ten-meter perimeter.

386
00:33:04,477 --> 00:33:05,637
Ten-meter perimeter. Copy.

387
00:33:05,957 --> 00:33:09,357
Lead One, per pre-flight,
maintain minimum ten-meter perimeter.

388
00:33:09,877 --> 00:33:10,877
Copy that.

389
00:33:10,957 --> 00:33:14,317
Forty meters, 35, 30...

390
00:33:18,157 --> 00:33:19,117
No, no, no.

391
00:33:19,197 --> 00:33:20,877
They're too close.

392
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:22,637
If they can't get over the fire,
how are they supposed...

393
00:33:22,717 --> 00:33:24,197
The wind will have to carry it.

394
00:33:24,277 --> 00:33:26,797
Tell them,
they cannot go over the core.

395
00:33:29,317 --> 00:33:30,477
Lead One is too close.

396
00:33:30,557 --> 00:33:32,877
I repeat, they are too close.

397
00:33:32,957 --> 00:33:34,157
Copy.

398
00:33:34,957 --> 00:33:36,997
Lead One,
you are inside the perimeter.

399
00:33:37,797 --> 00:33:40,917
Did not copy.
Signal's breaking up.

400
00:33:42,637 --> 00:33:43,637
Lead One?

401
00:33:45,037 --> 00:33:45,997
Do you copy?

402
00:33:46,917 --> 00:33:48,237
Lead One, do you copy?

403
00:33:49,197 --> 00:33:50,997
Lead One, come in.

404
00:33:51,077 --> 00:33:52,757
Do you copy, Lead One?

405
00:33:52,837 --> 00:33:53,957
Lead One!

406
00:34:11,757 --> 00:34:13,797
Sir?
What do I tell the others?

407
00:34:16,397 --> 00:34:18,237
Is there any other way, Legasov?

408
00:34:26,477 --> 00:34:27,597
Send the next one in.

409
00:34:29,717 --> 00:34:31,237
Tell them to approach from the west.

410
00:34:32,357 --> 00:34:35,316
Lead Two,
approach from the west.

411
00:34:55,757 --> 00:34:57,637
Kurchatov Institute Laboratory Four.

412
00:34:58,356 --> 00:35:01,917
Marina Gruzinskaya,
it's Ulana Khomyuk from Minsk.

413
00:35:04,357 --> 00:35:05,317
Oh, yes.

414
00:35:05,397 --> 00:35:07,837
How nice of you to phone.
It's been too long.

415
00:35:07,917 --> 00:35:08,997
It has.

416
00:35:09,077 --> 00:35:11,597
I was actually calling
about our friend.

417
00:35:11,677 --> 00:35:13,837
-You know, the one in the country.
-Oh, yes, of course.

418
00:35:13,917 --> 00:35:17,317
I wanted to see how he's doing.
It's so hot there right now.

419
00:35:17,397 --> 00:35:19,756
Yes, it's extremely hot,

420
00:35:19,837 --> 00:35:21,277
but his nephews are flying down,

421
00:35:21,357 --> 00:35:23,197
and they always bring cool weather.

422
00:35:23,277 --> 00:35:24,637
Oh, which nephews?

423
00:35:25,757 --> 00:35:28,877
Simka, who's 14,
and little Boris, who's five.

424
00:35:29,397 --> 00:35:30,717
Well that's wonderful.

425
00:35:30,797 --> 00:35:32,597
Though children can
make you even hotter

426
00:35:32,677 --> 00:35:34,197
when they're crawling all over you.

427
00:35:34,277 --> 00:35:35,477
Maybe I should visit them.

428
00:35:35,557 --> 00:35:37,597
No, they don't want visitors.

429
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:39,677
I'm sorry, um,
I have to get back to work.

430
00:35:39,757 --> 00:35:41,597
It's very busy right now. Goodbye.

431
00:35:44,837 --> 00:35:47,077
They're dropping sand
and boron on the fire.

432
00:35:48,237 --> 00:35:49,277
It's what I would do.

433
00:35:51,317 --> 00:35:53,076
Yes, I'm sure it is.

434
00:36:14,517 --> 00:36:15,677
Where are you going?

435
00:36:16,717 --> 00:36:17,677
Chernobyl.

436
00:36:25,677 --> 00:36:28,397
It's been smooth. Twenty drops.

437
00:36:33,837 --> 00:36:35,357
What?

438
00:36:37,837 --> 00:36:41,356
There are 50,000 people
in this city.

439
00:36:42,596 --> 00:36:45,756
Professor ll yin,
who's also on the commission,

440
00:36:45,837 --> 00:36:48,557
says the radiation isn't
high enough to evacuate.

441
00:36:48,636 --> 00:36:50,717
Ii yin isn't a physicist.

442
00:36:50,797 --> 00:36:53,197
Well, he's a medical doctor.
If he says it's safe, it's safe.

443
00:36:53,277 --> 00:36:55,677
-Not if they stay here.
-We're staying here.

444
00:36:55,756 --> 00:36:58,957
Yes, we are, and we'll be dead
in five years.

445
00:37:07,437 --> 00:37:09,717
I'm sorry, ...

446
00:37:09,797 --> 00:37:11,317
I'm sorry.

447
00:37:48,197 --> 00:37:50,196
Shcherbina.

448
00:38:00,197 --> 00:38:01,397
Thank you.

449
00:38:07,797 --> 00:38:11,437
A nuclear plant in Sweden
has detected radiation

450
00:38:11,517 --> 00:38:14,437
and identified it
as a by-product of our fuel.

451
00:38:15,517 --> 00:38:17,797
The Americans took satellite photos.

452
00:38:19,117 --> 00:38:22,156
The reactor building,
the smoke, the fire.

453
00:38:24,597 --> 00:38:26,237
The whole world knows.

454
00:38:32,957 --> 00:38:34,957
The wind has been blowing
toward Germany.

455
00:38:36,836 --> 00:38:39,077
They're not letting
children play outside

456
00:38:41,037 --> 00:38:42,437
in Frankfurt.

457
00:38:53,716 --> 00:38:54,717
Want a smoke?

458
00:39:10,436 --> 00:39:12,877
There has been a nuclear
accident in the Soviet Union

459
00:39:12,957 --> 00:39:14,676
and the Soviets
have admitted that it happened.

460
00:39:14,757 --> 00:39:16,076
The Soviet version is this,

461
00:39:16,196 --> 00:39:17,637
One of the atomic reactors

462
00:39:17,716 --> 00:39:20,837
at the Chernobyl Atomic Power Plant
near the city of Kiev was damaged,

463
00:39:20,917 --> 00:39:22,677
and there is speculation in Moscow

464
00:39:22,757 --> 00:39:25,077
that people were injured
and may have died.

465
00:39:25,157 --> 00:39:27,957
The Soviets may have been fairly quick
to acknowledge the accident

466
00:39:28,037 --> 00:39:31,237
because evidence in the form
of mild nuclear radiation

467
00:39:31,317 --> 00:39:34,637
had already reached beyond
the Soviet borders to Scandinavia.

468
00:43:39,357 --> 00:43:42,156
I said turn around.
This is a restricted zone.

469
00:43:42,237 --> 00:43:44,436
I'm from the Byelorussian
Institute for Nuclear Energy.

470
00:43:44,516 --> 00:43:45,996
Do you have permission?

471
00:43:46,077 --> 00:43:48,476
Listen to me, I need to speak
to someone urgently.

472
00:43:48,556 --> 00:43:49,716
Turn around right now,

473
00:43:49,796 --> 00:43:50,796
or I'll arrest you.

474
00:43:50,877 --> 00:43:54,557
If you arrest me, you should take me
to the highest possible authority.

475
00:43:58,957 --> 00:44:01,397
We have to start
a radiological survey.

476
00:44:01,476 --> 00:44:04,997
Sector by sector, on foot,
dosimeters in hand.

477
00:44:06,877 --> 00:44:08,196
Are you all right?

478
00:44:10,877 --> 00:44:12,156
Of course.

479
00:44:13,556 --> 00:44:17,556
Comrades... The guards arrested
this woman at the south checkpoint.

480
00:44:17,636 --> 00:44:19,156
I'd have put her in a cell...

481
00:44:19,237 --> 00:44:21,476
But he thought you should
know that I know.

482
00:44:21,557 --> 00:44:23,436
I know that
your reactor core is exposed.

483
00:44:23,517 --> 00:44:26,156
I know the graphite's on fire,
the fuel is melting,

484
00:44:26,237 --> 00:44:28,277
and you're dropping
sand and boron on it,

485
00:44:28,356 --> 00:44:31,157
which you probably thought was
smart, but you've made a mistake.

486
00:44:31,236 --> 00:44:34,436
Ulana Yuriyvna Khomyuk,
Chief Physicist,

487
00:44:34,516 --> 00:44:36,636
Byelorussian Institute
for Nuclear Energy.

488
00:44:36,716 --> 00:44:39,996
And you are
Valery Alexeyevich Legasov?

489
00:44:40,077 --> 00:44:42,316
Smothering the core
will put the fire out,

490
00:44:42,396 --> 00:44:45,157
but the temperature will
eventually increase...

491
00:44:45,236 --> 00:44:46,716
Believe me,
I'm perfectly aware.

492
00:44:46,797 --> 00:44:48,756
But I estimate at least a month

493
00:44:48,836 --> 00:44:50,596
before it melts through
the lower concrete pad,

494
00:44:50,676 --> 00:44:51,757
- which gives us time...
- No.

495
00:44:51,836 --> 00:44:54,116
You don't have a month.
You have approximately two days.

496
00:44:55,197 --> 00:44:56,316
Yes,

497
00:44:56,397 --> 00:44:58,317
the fuel would take a month

498
00:44:58,396 --> 00:45:00,316
to reach the concrete pad here.

499
00:45:00,756 --> 00:45:01,716
But first...

500
00:45:03,076 --> 00:45:06,157
it's going to burn through
the biological shield here by Tuesday.

501
00:45:06,236 --> 00:45:07,636
And when it does,

502
00:45:07,716 --> 00:45:10,516
it's going to hit these tanks,
bubbler pools, reservoirs...

503
00:45:10,596 --> 00:45:13,356
Reservoirs for the ECS.
I understand your concern,

504
00:45:13,437 --> 00:45:15,477
but I confirmed it
with plant personnel.

505
00:45:15,556 --> 00:45:17,756
-The tanks are nearly empty.
-No, they were nearly empty.

506
00:45:18,956 --> 00:45:21,676
Each of these points here, here,

507
00:45:21,756 --> 00:45:24,276
and here all drain
to the bubbler pools.

508
00:45:24,356 --> 00:45:26,916
I'm guessing that every pipe
in the building ruptured.

509
00:45:26,997 --> 00:45:29,916
And then there are those fire engines
that I saw on the way in.

510
00:45:29,997 --> 00:45:31,996
The fire hoses are still connected.

511
00:45:32,716 --> 00:45:35,316
They've been gushing water
into the structure this whole time.

512
00:45:35,396 --> 00:45:36,636
The tanks are full.

513
00:45:38,076 --> 00:45:40,317
The tanks are full.

514
00:46:18,557 --> 00:46:22,596
I have 10 minutes,
then I'm back on the phone

515
00:46:22,677 --> 00:46:25,476
apologizing to our friends,

516
00:46:25,557 --> 00:46:27,836
apologizing to our enemies.

517
00:46:28,876 --> 00:46:31,997
Our power comes
from the perception of our power.

518
00:46:32,636 --> 00:46:35,556
Do you understand
the damage this has done?

519
00:46:35,636 --> 00:46:37,596
Do you understand what's at stake?

520
00:46:39,837 --> 00:46:41,036
Boris.

521
00:46:43,476 --> 00:46:47,237
Professor Legasov
will deliver our briefing.

522
00:46:49,356 --> 00:46:50,836
There is some good news.

523
00:46:50,916 --> 00:46:53,516
The air drops are working
to douse the fire.

524
00:46:53,596 --> 00:46:57,237
There's been a reduction
in radionuclide emissions,

525
00:46:57,316 --> 00:47:01,236
but the fire will not be extinguished
for at least another two weeks.

526
00:47:03,676 --> 00:47:06,876
There is also an additional problem.

527
00:47:07,916 --> 00:47:09,676
Nuclear fuel doesn't turn cold

528
00:47:09,756 --> 00:47:12,356
simply because it is not on fire.

529
00:47:12,436 --> 00:47:13,676
In fact, the temperature
will likely rise

530
00:47:13,756 --> 00:47:16,556
as a result of the blanket of sand
we've dropped.

531
00:47:16,636 --> 00:47:19,356
The uranium will melt the sand,

532
00:47:19,436 --> 00:47:21,237
creating a kind of lava

533
00:47:21,316 --> 00:47:24,316
which will begin to melt down
through the shield below.

534
00:47:24,397 --> 00:47:25,996
You have made lava?

535
00:47:28,116 --> 00:47:29,996
I anticipated this.

536
00:47:31,956 --> 00:47:36,197
I believed there was time to reinforce
this lower concrete pad

537
00:47:36,276 --> 00:47:39,276
before the lava reached the Earth
and contaminated the groundwater.

538
00:47:39,357 --> 00:47:42,356
But as it turned out, I was
worried about the wrong thing.

539
00:47:42,436 --> 00:47:44,076
Uh...

540
00:47:44,157 --> 00:47:47,556
It was my understanding
that these large water tanks

541
00:47:47,636 --> 00:47:50,236
under the reactor
were essentially empty.

542
00:47:50,317 --> 00:47:53,276
This is Ulana Khomyuk
of the Byelorussian Institute.

543
00:47:53,356 --> 00:47:55,436
Thanks to her insight,
we are now aware

544
00:47:55,516 --> 00:47:58,836
that the tanks are, in fact, full.

545
00:47:58,916 --> 00:48:02,316
Of water.
Why is that a problem, Professor?

546
00:48:06,476 --> 00:48:08,196
When the lava enters these tanks,

547
00:48:08,276 --> 00:48:10,596
it will instantly
superheat and vaporize

548
00:48:10,676 --> 00:48:14,196
approximately 7,000
cubic meters of water,

549
00:48:14,276 --> 00:48:17,516
causing a significant
thermal explosion.

550
00:48:18,196 --> 00:48:19,756
How significant?

551
00:48:19,836 --> 00:48:23,436
We estimate
between two and four megatons.

552
00:48:23,876 --> 00:48:26,356
Everything within
a 30-kilometer radius

553
00:48:26,436 --> 00:48:28,276
will be completely destroyed,

554
00:48:28,356 --> 00:48:31,596
including the three remaining
reactors at Chernobyl.

555
00:48:31,676 --> 00:48:34,916
The entirety of the radioactive
material in all of the cores

556
00:48:34,996 --> 00:48:38,076
will be ejected at force

557
00:48:38,156 --> 00:48:40,116
and dispersed by a massive shock wave,

558
00:48:41,276 --> 00:48:43,316
which will extend

559
00:48:43,397 --> 00:48:46,116
approximately 200 kilometers

560
00:48:46,196 --> 00:48:49,116
and likely be fatal
to the entire population of Kiev

561
00:48:49,196 --> 00:48:50,916
as well as a portion of Minsk.

562
00:48:51,476 --> 00:48:54,196
The release of radiation
will be severe

563
00:48:54,276 --> 00:48:55,756
and will impact

564
00:48:55,836 --> 00:48:59,916
all of Soviet Ukraine,
Latvia, Lithuania,

565
00:48:59,997 --> 00:49:04,236
Byelorussia, as well as Poland,
Czechoslovakia, Hungary,

566
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:06,516
Romania, and most of East Germany.

567
00:49:10,236 --> 00:49:12,916
What do you mean "impact?"

568
00:49:13,876 --> 00:49:16,356
For much of the area,
a nearly permanent disruption

569
00:49:16,436 --> 00:49:18,076
of the food and water supply,

570
00:49:19,116 --> 00:49:21,836
a steep increase in the rates
of cancer and birth defects.

571
00:49:21,916 --> 00:49:24,316
I don't know how many deaths
there will be, but many.

572
00:49:25,196 --> 00:49:26,956
For Byelorussia and the Ukraine,

573
00:49:27,036 --> 00:49:29,596
"impact" means
completely uninhabitable

574
00:49:29,676 --> 00:49:32,076
for a minimum of 100 years.

575
00:49:36,396 --> 00:49:39,596
There are more than 50 million people

576
00:49:39,676 --> 00:49:42,276
living in Byelorussia and Ukraine.

577
00:49:42,356 --> 00:49:44,236
Sixty, yes.

578
00:49:48,396 --> 00:49:50,076
And how long before this happens?

579
00:49:50,556 --> 00:49:52,836
Approximately 48 to 72 hours.

580
00:49:57,396 --> 00:49:59,556
But we may have a solution.

581
00:49:59,636 --> 00:50:01,516
We can pump the water from the tanks.

582
00:50:01,596 --> 00:50:04,636
Unfortunately, the tanks are
sealed shut by a sluice gate,

583
00:50:04,716 --> 00:50:06,276
and the gate can only be opened

584
00:50:06,356 --> 00:50:08,236
manually from within
the duct system itself.

585
00:50:08,316 --> 00:50:11,476
So, we need to find
three plant workers

586
00:50:11,556 --> 00:50:13,876
who know the facility well enough
to enter the basement,

587
00:50:13,956 --> 00:50:18,596
here, find their way through
all these duct ways,

588
00:50:18,676 --> 00:50:20,956
get to the sluice gate valve here,

589
00:50:21,036 --> 00:50:25,116
and give us the access we need
to pump out the tanks.

590
00:50:25,436 --> 00:50:27,956
Of course, we will need
your permission.

591
00:50:28,236 --> 00:50:29,996
My permission for what?

592
00:50:30,076 --> 00:50:32,556
Uh, the water in these ducts,

593
00:50:32,636 --> 00:50:35,316
the level of
radioactive contamination...

594
00:50:35,396 --> 00:50:37,116
They'll likely be dead in a week.

595
00:50:39,356 --> 00:50:42,756
We're asking for your permission
to kill three men.

596
00:50:50,556 --> 00:50:52,156
Well...

597
00:50:52,236 --> 00:50:55,276
Comrade Legasov,

598
00:50:55,356 --> 00:50:57,916
All victories inevitably
come at a cost.

599
00:52:20,036 --> 00:52:22,956
And open the sluice gate valve, here.

600
00:52:23,716 --> 00:52:27,556
The valve will be difficult
to operate, so we'll need three men

601
00:52:27,635 --> 00:52:31,075
who will need to know
the basement layout.

602
00:52:31,156 --> 00:52:34,796
And, of course, any volunteers
will be rewarded.

603
00:52:35,276 --> 00:52:38,475
A yearly stipend of 400 rubles.

604
00:52:45,156 --> 00:52:49,715
And, uh, for those of you working
in reactors one and two, promotions.

605
00:52:49,796 --> 00:52:53,436
Why are reactors
one and two still operating at all?

606
00:52:53,956 --> 00:52:57,116
My friend was a security guard
that night, and, uh, she's now dying.

607
00:52:57,675 --> 00:52:59,836
And we've all heard about the firemen.

608
00:52:59,916 --> 00:53:03,715
And now you want us to swim
underneath a burning reactor?

609
00:53:04,356 --> 00:53:06,315
Do you even know
how contaminated it is?

610
00:53:08,556 --> 00:53:10,316
I don't have an exact number.

611
00:53:10,396 --> 00:53:13,476
You don't need an exact number
to know if it will kill us.

612
00:53:13,556 --> 00:53:14,756
But you can't even tell us that.

613
00:53:16,796 --> 00:53:19,036
Why should we do this?
For what, 400 rubles?

614
00:53:22,516 --> 00:53:24,555
You'll do it because it must be done.

615
00:53:29,516 --> 00:53:31,955
You'll do it because nobody else can.

616
00:53:34,956 --> 00:53:38,396
And if you don't, millions will die.

617
00:53:39,596 --> 00:53:41,835
If you tell me that's not enough,
I won't believe you.

618
00:53:43,596 --> 00:53:47,556
This is what has always
set our people apart.

619
00:53:47,636 --> 00:53:50,436
A thousand years of sacrifice
in our veins.

620
00:53:51,435 --> 00:53:53,796
And every generation
must know its own suffering.

621
00:53:54,796 --> 00:53:57,755
I spit on the people who did this,

622
00:53:57,836 --> 00:53:59,675
and I curse the price I have to pay.

623
00:54:02,675 --> 00:54:06,476
But I'm making my peace with it,
now you make yours.

624
00:54:06,996 --> 00:54:08,595
And go into that water.

625
00:54:11,036 --> 00:54:12,796
Because it must be done.

626
00:54:29,236 --> 00:54:30,636
Ananenko.

627
00:54:34,795 --> 00:54:36,196
Bezpalov.

628
00:54:40,955 --> 00:54:42,556
Baranov.
