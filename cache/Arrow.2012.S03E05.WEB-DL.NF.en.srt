The NSA needed a hacker
with game for cyber espionage...

460
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:17,029
...and I needed to not be in prison
for the rest of my life.

461
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:22,576
Because of what the NSA wanted me doing,
it was advantageous for me to be dead.

462
00:28:22,743 --> 00:28:24,536
When I found out you died...

463

I was gonna find you.

you'd become this corporate lapdog.

the trucks are shut down.</i>

and direct the cash to come here.</i>
