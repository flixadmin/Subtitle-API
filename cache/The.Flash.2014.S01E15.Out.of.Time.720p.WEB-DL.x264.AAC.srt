Previously on <i>the Flash...</i>

It's Clyde Mardon.

17
00:00:35,302 --> 00:00:37,302
I think he can
control the weather.

I didn't think there was
anyone else like me.

I'm not like you.
You're a murderer.

He and I are just
best friends.

00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:53,685
So how do we catch somebody
that even I can't keep up with?

23
00:00:53,687 --> 00:00:55,754
We can fashion
an electronic barrier

24
00:00:55,756 --> 00:00:58,123
To trap the Reverse-Flash.

25
00:00:58,125 --> 00:00:59,425
The super capacitors,

26
00:00:59,427 --> 00:01:02,327
The containment field
is fluctuating.

27
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:04,763
I still don't know why
the containment system failed.

28
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:06,031
I must have missed something.

29
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:07,966
You think Dr. Wells
killed Barry's mom?

30
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:13,405
I don't know yet, but I do know
that Wells keeps secrets,

31
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,107
And this may be one of them.

32
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:20,612
I got a plane to catch!

Barry, you're in a morgue.

140
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,480
You're gonna have to be a little
more specific than that.

141
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:59,484
The coroner, he's dead.

142
00:07:08,162 --> 00:07:09,628
The mayor's made this
high priority.

143
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:12,330
Copy that, Captain.

144
00:07:12,332 --> 00:07:13,799

- Oh.

145
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:16,668
Allen, my fiance
just bought me this!

146
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,136
Yeah, I'm so sorry, Captain.

147
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:20,739
Eh! Just help Joe
find out who did this.

148
00:07:20,741 --> 00:07:23,108
Mm-hmm.

149
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,776
What's with all the water?

150
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:25,877
Did the sprinkler system
go off or something?

151
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,379
No, I checked

152
00:07:27,381 --> 00:07:29,948
All the sprinklers.
They're all intact.

153
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,184
But look at this.

154
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,220
What is that, ice?

155
00:07:35,222 --> 00:07:36,421
Mm-hmm.

156
00:07:36,423 --> 00:07:39,291
The coroner has multiple
impact bruises on his torso,

157
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:41,226
All the size of a tennis ball.

158
00:07:41,228 --> 00:07:43,295
Judging by the amount of ice
and water on the ground,

159
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:45,397
I'm guessing he was
killed by hail.

160
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,731
Hail?
In here?

161
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:47,732
Yeah.

162
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:49,568
Do you think this was Snart?

163
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:52,070
No, his cold-gun couldn't
have done this.

164
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:53,905
Joe, we got something.

165
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:55,040
The coroner's office
just installed

166
00:07:55,042 --> 00:07:57,008
An automated
dictation system.

167
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,710
Listen to this.

168
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:00,412
Please, no more.

169
00:08:00,414 --> 00:08:02,013
I'll stop when you tell me...

170
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:03,181
stop.

171
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:04,483
Who killed him?

172
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:06,017
I know that voice.
That's Mardon.

173
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:07,619
- I want a name.
- Clyde Mardon's dead.

174
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:09,621
It's not Clyde Mardon.
It's his brother, Mark.

175
00:08:09,623 --> 00:08:12,123
It was Detective West.

176
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:16,328
He shot him. Detective Joe West
killed your brother.

177
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,096
He will pay for what he did.

178
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:32,444
So Clyde Mardon
has a brother?

179
00:08:32,446 --> 00:08:35,013
And both brothers
survived the plane crash,

180
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,348
And then
the dark matter released

181
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,350
From the particle accelerator
explosion

182
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:41,820
Affects them both
in virtually the same way.

183
00:08:41,822 --> 00:08:45,190
Yeah, only Mark's powers
seem to be a lot more precise.

184
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:47,893
To be able to control
the weather like that, indoors?

185
00:08:47,895 --> 00:08:49,961
You'd have to be
a weather wizard.

186
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:52,831
Ooh, been waiting since week one
to use that one.

187
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,299
- Mm!
- Trigeminal headache?

188
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:55,567
- What?
- Trigeminal headache.

189
00:08:55,569 --> 00:08:56,968
Brain freeze.

190
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,370
Then why don't you just
call it a brain freeze?

191
00:08:58,372 --> 00:09:00,238
So I'm guessing you
running around a twister

192
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,674
In the opposite direction isn't
gonna to do the trick this time.

193
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:05,277
I just remembered.
During our run-in with Mardon,

194
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,379
Clyde Mardon,
I was tinkering with something

195
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:10,181
To help attract
unbound atmospheric electrons.

196
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:11,550
Like a grounding mechanism?

197
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:13,351
Yes, 'cause the only way
that Mardon can

198
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:14,586
Control the weather...

199
00:09:14,588 --> 00:09:16,121
Is if he can tap
into the atmosphere's

200
00:09:16,123 --> 00:09:17,989
Natural electrical circuit,
and if we

201
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:21,092
Take away that circuit,
clear skies.

202
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:22,794
Singh's checking in.
I gotta go.

203
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:24,296
Yeah, I'll meet you
at the station.

204
00:09:24,298 --> 00:09:26,731
Joe, we'll find Mardon.
Don't worry.

205
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:29,401
I'm not worried at all.

206
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:31,736
Well, he's taking
being targeted

207
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:34,806
By a revenge-seeking meta-human
rather well, I must say.

208
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:38,109
Don't worry, Barry.
Joe will be fine, I promise.

209
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:39,711
Yeah, no, I know.

210
00:09:39,713 --> 00:09:41,780
I actually wanted to talk to you
about something else.

211
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:43,114
- Mm-hmm?
- Um...

212
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:46,985
Look, last night,
on my way to the morgue,

213
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:48,119
I saw something.

214
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:49,521
What'd you see?

215
00:09:49,523 --> 00:09:53,892
I was running and I turned
and I saw myself.

216
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:58,530
Or I don't know, another Flash
running beside me.

217
00:09:58,532 --> 00:09:59,831
Interesting.

218
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,733
Yeah.
What do you think it was?

219
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:03,468
Could be an optical illusion,
a mirroring effect

220
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:07,272
Caused by wind shear and light,
a speed mirage, if you will.

221
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:11,176
It didn't seem like that.
It was...

222
00:10:11,178 --> 00:10:13,244
He seemed real.

223
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:16,648
I tell you what.
Let's focus on finding Mardon,

224
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:19,651
And once he's safely contained
in the pipeline,

225
00:10:19,653 --> 00:10:22,253
We'll investigate this.

226
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,160
Where are we at with Mardon?

227
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:31,062
No one at the morgue
saw or heard anything.

228
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:32,330
We're canvassing
known associates,

229
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:33,732
Seeing if he reached
out to anybody.

230
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:35,634
Maybe can get a lead
on where he's holed up.

231
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:37,469
All right, why don't we let
Thawne do that?

232
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:39,604
Because nobody knows the Mardon
brothers better than I do.

233
00:10:39,606 --> 00:10:41,706
I mean, Chyre and I
tracked them for years.

234
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:42,807
I know how they think.

235
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:43,975
Which is why you should
coordinate

236
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:47,012
The investigation from here.

237
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:59,457
Hey.

238
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,559
If you guys want to
keep that smile

239
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:04,596
On that pretty face, she doesn't
hear about any of this.

240
00:11:04,598 --> 00:11:06,097
Mm-hmm.

241
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:07,098
Hey, sweetheart.

242
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,601
- Hey, dad.
- Mm.

243
00:11:09,603 --> 00:11:11,136
- Hi.
- Hey.

244
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,640
So, what are you guys
working on?

245
00:11:15,642 --> 00:11:17,809
You got any good leads
for an honest reporter?

246
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:21,513
Things are actually pretty quiet
around here right now.

247
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,217
Can you guys
give me a minute?

248
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:28,553
Yeah, me and Barry were actually
gonna go grab lunch.

249
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:29,587
We were?

250
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:31,956
Right, yeah, yeah.

251
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,491
Duh.

252
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,895
Hey.
Ever since last night,

253
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:41,399
You've barely said a peep.
What is going on?

254
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:42,600
I didn't like the way I felt

255
00:11:42,602 --> 00:11:45,136
Watching you and Barry
last night.

256
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:47,238
Eddie, Barry, he's just...

257
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,441
Like family.
I know, and I know

258
00:11:49,443 --> 00:11:51,176
You two have a long history
that pre-dates me,

259
00:11:51,178 --> 00:11:54,312
But Iris, we live together.
You're my girlfriend,

260
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:58,717
And someday, hopefully,
you'll be more.

261
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:01,386
I don't like feeling
like the odd man out

262
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:03,021
Every time you and Barry
are together.

263
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:04,522
And I shouldn't have to.

264
00:12:04,524 --> 00:12:07,692
Eddie, Barry is always
gonna be a part of my life.

265
00:12:07,694 --> 00:12:13,198
I get that, but something's
changed between you two.

266
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,801
Whatever that is,
I am not okay with it.

267
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,843
Mm.

268
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:27,078
I haven't had one of those
in way too long.

269
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,848
Felt appropriate.

270
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:34,219
So, you want to talk about
what's been going on with you?

271
00:12:34,221 --> 00:12:35,887
What do you think's been
going on with me, Barry?

272
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:37,222
You just seem a bit cavalier,

273
00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:38,757
Considering what
we're up against.

274
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,625
<i>We</i> aren't up against anything.

275
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:42,727
- Joe, come on, I...
- Look, I'm fine.

276
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:44,662
Can we just change
the subject, please?

277
00:12:44,664 --> 00:12:46,264
Sure.

278
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,767
Actually, you know,
I could use some advice.

279
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:50,068
About what?

280
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:53,605
Uh, you know,
just relationship stuff.

281
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:56,207
Oh, you mean, like,
that girl, Linda?

282
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:59,611
No, actually.
With Iris.

283
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:04,415
Things between us have gotten
a little complicated... again.

284
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:08,520
You're asking
your adopted father

285
00:13:08,522 --> 00:13:11,589
For advice about being in love
with his daughter,

286
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:14,292
Who just so happens to be
dating his partner?

287
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:15,527
I know, I know.

288
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:18,196
Things have gone
way past complicated.

289
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:20,365
Sometimes, me and Iris
have these moments,

290
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:23,268
And when I'm looking
into her eyes,

291
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,636
It's hard not to think

292
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:27,372
That she's feeling
the same way I do.

293
00:13:27,374 --> 00:13:29,941
Look, you already told Iris
how you feel,

294
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:33,545
So unless she comes out and
says she feels the same way,

295
00:13:33,547 --> 00:13:35,914
All you can do is
hold on to those moments.

296
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,916
Man, it is coming down.

297
00:13:37,918 --> 00:13:38,917
Yeah.

298
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:44,722
And it's another beautiful day
here in Central City.

299
00:13:44,724 --> 00:13:45,924
Not a cloud.

300
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,727
Mardon.

301
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:25,997
You're confined to the precinct
until Mardon's caught.

302
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:27,298
David, you said it yourself.

303
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,900
That son of a bitch
killed my partner.

304
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:31,369
And I'm not gonna lose you
the way I lost Fred Chyre.

305
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,071
Look, I can't stop you
being pissed, Joe,

306
00:14:33,073 --> 00:14:35,540
But I can keep you safe.

307
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:37,709
Maybe your daughter
can contact the Flash.

308
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:41,346
I'm not getting her
involved in this.

309
00:14:41,348 --> 00:14:44,148
Allen, make sure
he doesn't go anywhere.

310
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,284
I need to be out there.

311
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:48,019
Joe, you're always
the first one

312
00:14:48,021 --> 00:14:49,721
To tell me when I'm not
thinking clearly.

313
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:51,890
I took down Clyde.
I can take down

314
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:53,024
His dirt bag brother too.

315
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:56,794
You didn't do that alone,
remember?

316
00:14:56,796 --> 00:14:58,696
You're right.

317
00:14:58,698 --> 00:15:01,399
How are any of these guys
going to protect me?

318
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:04,269
They don't know. They don't know
what Mardon's capable of.

319
00:15:04,271 --> 00:15:05,503
All right, well,
lucky for you,

320
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:07,872
Your friends
at S.T.A.R. Labs do.

321
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:22,754
"The Flash: Speeding his way
into our lives?"

322
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:24,822
That's a little on the nose,
don't you think?

323
00:15:25,659 --> 00:15:27,692
I want to show you something.

324
00:15:27,694 --> 00:15:29,594
Simon Stagg.
Remember him?

325
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,663
Hasn't been seen in,
like, six months.

326
00:15:31,665 --> 00:15:33,564
I thought the rumor was
he was a recluse.

327
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:36,301
You know,
went all Howard Hughes.

328
00:15:36,303 --> 00:15:38,736
This was taken the night
that Stagg went missing.

329
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:40,204
The last person to leave
Stagg industries

330
00:15:40,206 --> 00:15:43,708
The night that Stagg disappeared
was Harrison Wells.

331
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,376
This doesn't prove anything,
Mason.

332
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:47,712
It's enough for me
to develop a theory.

333
00:15:47,714 --> 00:15:51,382
Every trail in this files leads
to one person, Harrison Wells,

334
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:52,850
Which is why I need for you
to start asking

335
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:56,054
Your friends who know him
some questions, Iris.

336
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,597
Linda.

337
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:08,533
Hi.

338
00:16:08,535 --> 00:16:10,268
Last night was fun.

339
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,836
Mm-hmm.

340
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:13,771
Oh, yeah.

341
00:16:13,773 --> 00:16:16,240
Look, I just wanted
to apologize.

342
00:16:16,242 --> 00:16:18,009
Apologize...?

343
00:16:18,011 --> 00:16:20,178
Well, for interrupting
your date with Barry.

344
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:25,016
I shouldn't have done that...
And I'm sorry.

345
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:28,619
You know, Iris,

346
00:16:28,621 --> 00:16:31,022
When you told me that
Barry had feelings for you,

347
00:16:31,024 --> 00:16:33,658
I thought it was just
the typical weird crap

348
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,860
That women do to each other,

349
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:39,130
But last night, I realized
what you didn't tell me,

350
00:16:39,132 --> 00:16:41,366
And what's kind of irritating

351
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:45,336
Is that you have feelings
for him too.

352
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:47,638
N-no, Linda, I mean,
it's not like that.

353
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,074
One thing you learn about people
when you work here, Iris,

354
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:54,012
It's usually what isn't said
that's the real story.

355
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,589
So it sounded like something
was kind of bothering you

356
00:17:04,591 --> 00:17:06,391
On the phone.
Is everything all right?

357
00:17:06,393 --> 00:17:08,326
Yeah, it's fine.

358
00:17:08,328 --> 00:17:09,594
So the other night
was fun, right?

359
00:17:09,596 --> 00:17:11,362
Yeah.
Did Eddie have a good time?

360
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:13,464
Yeah.
Linda?

361
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:14,899
I think so.

362
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:19,037
You don't think we were
too... You know.

363
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,038
No.

364
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,939
Okay, good.

365
00:17:21,941 --> 00:17:24,909
So the reason that I called you
was because my sort of advisor

366
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:26,978
at the paper is always
teaching me lessons,

367
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,013
tricks of the trade,
how to get a good story...

368
00:17:29,015 --> 00:17:31,616
And one of the things
he's repeatedly telling me

369
00:17:31,618 --> 00:17:34,519
is to follow your hunch,
see where it leads.

370
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:36,154
Sounds like good advice.

371
00:17:36,156 --> 00:17:38,022
Yeah, it is.

372
00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:42,493
Except in this instance,
that hunch involves you.

373
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:47,865
Well, you can ask me
anything, Iris.

374
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:50,635
It's about Harrison Wells.

375
00:17:50,637 --> 00:17:52,303
What about him?

376
00:17:52,305 --> 00:17:53,805
Well, I mean,
a lot of strange things

377
00:17:53,807 --> 00:17:56,174
Have been happening
in Central City this past year.

378
00:17:56,176 --> 00:17:59,343
The Flash, the burning man
people going missing.

379
00:17:59,345 --> 00:18:01,279
He was there
at Stagg's office

380
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:03,581
The night that Stagg
went missing.

381
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:11,155
And you think that Doctor Wells
is what, responsible?

382
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:15,660
I mean, I don't really know him,
but you and your friends do.

383
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:19,397
Uh-huh.

384
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:23,568
Barry, in your heart of hearts,
do you think it's possible

385
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,336
That there's more to Harrison

386
00:18:25,338 --> 00:18:28,773
Than people have been
led to believe?

387
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:31,742
Harrison Wells is a good man.

388
00:18:31,744 --> 00:18:33,177
If you're looking
for a story,

389
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:36,581
Then you're not gonna
find one with him.

390
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,718
I call it the wizard's wand.

391
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,253
Subtle.
How does it work?

392
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:44,255
Think of it like an
active lightning rod.

393
00:18:44,257 --> 00:18:46,691
You just point it at the sky,
and it'll suck up

394
00:18:46,693 --> 00:18:49,227
Whatever energy's floating
around it like a sponge.

395
00:18:49,229 --> 00:18:50,328
And it'll stop Mardon?

396
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,829
It'll certainly
slow him down.

397
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:53,731
If there's no atmospheric
electrons available to him,

398
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:55,166
There's no way for him
to control the weather.

399
00:18:55,168 --> 00:18:58,269
Good work, Cisco, as always.

400
00:18:58,271 --> 00:19:01,272
If you excuse me,
I'm gonna go stretch my legs.

401
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:08,579
You okay?
You seem a little off.

402
00:19:08,581 --> 00:19:12,150
Yeah, yeah.
Uh, somebody at...

403
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:14,452
Somebody at picture news
got it into Iris's head

404
00:19:14,454 --> 00:19:19,023
That something suspicious
is going on with Dr. Wells.

405
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:20,224
Like what?

406
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:22,426
That he knows what happened
to Simon Stagg.

407
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:24,862
Apparently, nobody's
heard from him or seen him

408
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:27,431
Since the night
I stopped Danton Black.

409
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:28,733
What'd you tell her?

410
00:19:28,735 --> 00:19:32,537
That she's wrong.
And she is.

411
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:40,578
Keep this handy.

412
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,779
I'll protect you
from Mardon's powers.

413
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:43,314
Yeah, Cisco, I got it.

414
00:19:43,316 --> 00:19:46,517
Hey, Joe... I know you got
a lot going on right now,

415
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:49,954
But... You mentioned Doctor Wells
might have had something to do

416
00:19:49,956 --> 00:19:52,590
With Barry's mother's murder.
Why did you think that?

417
00:19:52,592 --> 00:19:54,458
Oh, it doesn't matter.
I was wrong.

418
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,093
But you seemed
really sure of it.

419
00:19:56,095 --> 00:19:59,664
Look, Cisco, I can't talk
about this right now, okay?

420
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:18,783
I heard you were looking for me.

421
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:22,186
Here I am.

422
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,360
Mardon.

423
00:20:29,362 --> 00:20:30,828
Hey, Joe.

424
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:33,297
I can call you Joe, can't I?

425
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:35,099
Figured we don't got to be
too formal

426
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:38,402
Seeing as you put two bullets
in my brother's chest.

427
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:40,538
Your brother killed
my partner

428
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,707
And a whole lot
of innocent people,

429
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:44,842
And threatened to kill
even more.

430
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:50,715
Yeah, Clyde was no saint,
but he was family.

431
00:20:50,717 --> 00:20:53,618
If you can't protect
your family,

432
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:56,554
The least you can do
is avenge 'em.

433
00:20:59,225 --> 00:21:01,859
This is between us.

434
00:21:01,861 --> 00:21:03,494
Nobody else needs to get hurt.

435
00:21:03,496 --> 00:21:06,130
But they are gonna get hurt.

436
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:10,501
Joe!

437
00:21:10,503 --> 00:21:12,036
No!

438
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:14,538
I'm not gonna be so easy
to put down, Joe.

439
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,040
Take him down!

440
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,143
No, run!

441
00:21:19,145 --> 00:21:21,846
Huh!

442
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:30,921
Joe!

443
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:54,779
Captain!

444
00:21:57,015 --> 00:21:58,883
David.

445
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:10,995
All right, Cisco,
I'm heading home.

446
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:12,997
Cisco?

447
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:14,365
All right, fine, I will watch

448
00:22:14,367 --> 00:22:17,301
Every episode
of <i>The Walking Dead</i> with you.

449
00:22:17,303 --> 00:22:20,371
Hey, you couldn't have stopped
Mardon from attacking

450
00:22:20,373 --> 00:22:23,841
The police station.
It's not your fault.

451
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:26,477
No, that's not it.

452
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:28,312
What do you think
of Dr. Wells?

453
00:22:28,314 --> 00:22:30,247
- What do you mean?
- I mean, do you think

454
00:22:30,249 --> 00:22:35,152
He's capable of doing
something bad?

455
00:22:35,154 --> 00:22:37,755
Is this because of what Barry
said he heard?

456
00:22:37,757 --> 00:22:39,490
Ever since the particle
accelerator exploded,

457
00:22:39,492 --> 00:22:41,959
There's always someone who's
got it in for Dr. Wells.

458
00:22:41,961 --> 00:22:44,462
No, no, it's more than that.
Joe said that maybe

459
00:22:44,464 --> 00:22:46,063
Dr. Wells was somehow involved

460
00:22:46,065 --> 00:22:49,734
In of Barry's mother's death
and her murder.

461
00:22:49,736 --> 00:22:51,102
That's absurd.

462
00:22:51,104 --> 00:22:53,270
Yeah, I know,
and that's what I said,

463
00:22:53,272 --> 00:22:55,039
And we proved that
that wasn't the case,

464
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:58,309
But I'm just saying,
some things aren't adding up.

465
00:22:58,311 --> 00:23:00,277
Like what, for example?

466
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:02,413
Come here, look at this.

467
00:23:02,415 --> 00:23:03,881
The night we trapped
the Reverse-Flash

468
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:05,216
In the force-field,
he escaped

469
00:23:05,218 --> 00:23:06,851
Because the containment system
failed,

470
00:23:06,853 --> 00:23:08,486
But I checked that data
three times,

471
00:23:08,488 --> 00:23:10,354
And the super-capacitors
were still fully charged

472
00:23:10,356 --> 00:23:11,822
When he got out.

473
00:23:11,824 --> 00:23:13,457
The numbers don't add up,
Caitlin.

474
00:23:13,459 --> 00:23:14,992
There's no reason that
the containment system

475
00:23:14,994 --> 00:23:16,460
Should have failed.

476
00:23:16,462 --> 00:23:18,796
I'm sure there's
a perfectly good explanation.

477
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:20,231
One perfectly good explanation

478
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:22,299
Is that Wells did something
to the trap.

479
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:24,869
Are you suggesting
that Dr. Wells is in league

480
00:23:24,871 --> 00:23:26,470
With the man in the yellow suit?

481
00:23:26,472 --> 00:23:30,307
I'm... We all saw that thing
nearly kill him that night.

482
00:23:30,309 --> 00:23:33,310
Yeah, nearly.

483
00:23:34,647 --> 00:23:36,080
Cisco, what you're saying

484
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:39,150
Doesn't make any sense.
That's crazy.

485
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:45,823
Can you keep Wells out of
S.T.A.R. Labs tomorrow morning?

486
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:57,835
- Thank you, Barry.
- Yeah.

487
00:23:57,837 --> 00:24:02,239
This isn't how I thought I'd
finally meet David’s co-workers.

488
00:24:02,241 --> 00:24:04,708
He speaks very highly of you.

489
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:06,577
Really?

490
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:09,313
David's all bark.

491
00:24:09,315 --> 00:24:10,648
A very loud bark.

492
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:15,719
How is he, doctor?

493
00:24:15,721 --> 00:24:17,321
We're stabilizing him.

494
00:24:17,323 --> 00:24:19,857
He's experiencing some paralysis
in his lower extremities.

495
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:20,991
Oh, my god.

496
00:24:20,993 --> 00:24:22,259
The hardest thing
to gauge right now

497
00:24:22,261 --> 00:24:24,962
Is the extent of his
neurocognitive deficits.

498
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:28,566
So he may not be
the same person you remember.

499
00:24:28,568 --> 00:24:29,900
Can I see him?

500
00:24:29,902 --> 00:24:34,071
I'm sorry, visitation's
for family only.

501
00:24:34,073 --> 00:24:37,374
Being his fiance
makes him family, doctor.

502
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:39,376
Uh, sure.

503
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:44,548
Will he be able to return
to the force?

504
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:48,953
I'm actually not sure
he'll be able to walk again.

505
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:54,992
Joe, where are you going?

506
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:55,993
I need to end this.

507
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:56,994
Not by yourself.

508
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:59,096
Yes, by myself!
I know him!

509
00:24:59,098 --> 00:25:00,498
I can find him.
I don't want

510
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:04,535
Anybody else getting hurt,
especially Iris and you.

511
00:25:04,537 --> 00:25:05,870
Iris is fi...

512
00:25:05,872 --> 00:25:07,905
Mardon said he was
going to avenge his brother.

513
00:25:07,907 --> 00:25:09,507
That goes beyond me.
It goes all the way

514
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:11,041
To you and her.

515
00:25:11,043 --> 00:25:15,446
You stay with Iris,
and you keep her safe.

516
00:25:15,448 --> 00:25:17,781
Do not leave her side.

517
00:25:17,783 --> 00:25:19,550
Yeah, all right.

518
00:25:33,932 --> 00:25:36,934
Hey, have you seen Iris West?

519
00:25:36,936 --> 00:25:38,302
She went to see her dad.

520
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:40,271
- You're Barry Allen, right?
- Yeah.

521
00:25:40,273 --> 00:25:43,673
Her friend/brother?
Or is that brother/friend?

522
00:25:43,676 --> 00:25:44,842
Friend is fine.

523
00:25:44,844 --> 00:25:46,343
Oh.
I'm Mason Bridge.

524
00:25:46,345 --> 00:25:48,112
Oh, you're the guy who thinks

525
00:25:48,114 --> 00:25:49,813
Harrison Wells is
some mad genius?

526
00:25:49,815 --> 00:25:51,482
Oh, no, no, no, I never said
he was crazy.

527
00:25:51,484 --> 00:25:55,219
He's a sociopath and a liar,
for sure.

528
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:58,389
Really?
You don't see it?

529
00:25:58,391 --> 00:26:00,391
All the time you two
spend together.

530
00:26:00,393 --> 00:26:01,559
Excuse me?

531
00:26:01,561 --> 00:26:04,094
Sometimes when I'm bored,
I follow him around.

532
00:26:04,096 --> 00:26:06,196
And for the most part,
he keeps to himself,

533
00:26:06,198 --> 00:26:07,331
Except when he's
meeting up with you,

534
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:08,766
Which he seems to do
quite a bit.

535
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:11,869
And then one time,
he met up with Simon Stagg,

536
00:26:11,871 --> 00:26:13,671
And then poof,
no more Simon Stagg.

537
00:26:13,673 --> 00:26:16,540
So you're saying Wells
knows where Stagg is?

538
00:26:16,542 --> 00:26:20,110
No, I'm saying Wells
killed him.

539
00:26:20,112 --> 00:26:22,012
Ah.
All right, well,

540
00:26:22,014 --> 00:26:25,282
Even if I believed you, which
I don't, he's in a wheelchair.

541
00:26:25,284 --> 00:26:27,151
How could he possibly
have done that?

542
00:26:27,153 --> 00:26:29,320
I have evidence
in a secure digital file

543
00:26:29,322 --> 00:26:31,789
That will explain everything.

544
00:26:31,791 --> 00:26:34,158
What... what evidence?

545
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,826
You'll just have to
read about it

546
00:26:35,828 --> 00:26:39,129
In the Sunday paper,
like everybody else.

547
00:26:50,176 --> 00:26:52,009
Let's see if you can tell me

548
00:26:52,011 --> 00:26:55,212
What really went wrong
that night.

549
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:27,978
Hey!

550
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,913
Joe.

551
00:27:29,915 --> 00:27:32,516
Eddie.
You shouldn't be here.

552
00:27:32,518 --> 00:27:36,553
And you shouldn't be chasing
after Mardon alone, partner.

553
00:27:36,555 --> 00:27:37,855
You find anything?

554
00:27:37,857 --> 00:27:41,025
Not yet, but this was
an old Mardon brothers' hideout

555
00:27:41,027 --> 00:27:44,028
About six years ago,
so it's a long shot.

556
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:46,397
But listen, Eddie...

557
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:50,234
Save it.
I'm not leaving.

558
00:27:58,411 --> 00:28:01,879
Hey, have you heard from dad?
He's not answering his cell.

559
00:28:01,881 --> 00:28:03,347
Uh, no.

560
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:04,748
I haven't talked to him.

561
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:07,551
I'm starting to worry about him.

562
00:28:07,553 --> 00:28:10,554
What are you doing home
so early?

563
00:28:10,556 --> 00:28:16,126
I was looking for you, actually.
I just met your friend Mason,

564
00:28:16,128 --> 00:28:19,763
And he said he had
some kind of proof

565
00:28:19,765 --> 00:28:21,799
That Dr. Wells did something.

566
00:28:21,801 --> 00:28:23,767
Do you know what it is?

567
00:28:23,769 --> 00:28:25,936
No, he hasn't told me.

568
00:28:25,938 --> 00:28:27,371
All right.

569
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:32,910
So, how are things going
with Linda?

570
00:28:32,912 --> 00:28:33,911
Why do you say it like that?

571
00:28:33,913 --> 00:28:35,245
Like what?

572
00:28:35,247 --> 00:28:38,615
Like how you used to always
say "Becky Cooper."

573
00:28:38,617 --> 00:28:39,983
Oh, come on.

574
00:28:39,985 --> 00:28:43,487
Becky Cooper was a nightmare
of a high school girlfriend,

575
00:28:43,489 --> 00:28:45,122
And you should have
never dated her.

576
00:28:45,124 --> 00:28:47,491
Okay, so you're saying that
Linda is "Becky" material?

577
00:28:47,493 --> 00:28:49,259
I mean, I wouldn't
go that far.

578
00:28:49,261 --> 00:28:54,064
She's... Hot and nice
and smart

579
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:56,433
And she is really good
at her job.

580
00:28:56,435 --> 00:28:58,435
I just...

581
00:28:58,437 --> 00:29:01,472
I don't think that
she's the right one for you.

582
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:06,877
Then who is?

583
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:22,893
What?

584
00:29:22,895 --> 00:29:25,362
I don't understand.

585
00:29:25,364 --> 00:29:28,966
This doesn't make any sense.

586
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:55,292
Somebody was here
very recently.

587
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:02,232
He left this here for me.

588
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:03,934
Where to next?

589
00:30:06,806 --> 00:30:08,505
Ooh!

590
00:30:08,507 --> 00:30:09,907
Joe!

591
00:30:29,495 --> 00:30:33,697
Small miracle you only broke
the one leg, Joe.

592
00:30:33,699 --> 00:30:36,400
The night I got sucked
out of my plane,

593
00:30:36,402 --> 00:30:39,703
I broke almost every bone
in my body.

594
00:30:40,706 --> 00:30:42,406
It was excruciating.

595
00:30:42,408 --> 00:30:45,809
At least you got a small taste
of what that felt like.

596
00:30:45,811 --> 00:30:47,211
Still...

597
00:30:47,213 --> 00:30:50,547
Guess you'll never know what
it really feels like to be god.

598
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:52,349
That's what your brother
said to me,

599
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:55,085
Right before I killed him.

600
00:30:55,087 --> 00:30:57,654
Aah.

601
00:30:57,656 --> 00:31:01,391
I don't need these powers
to end your life.

602
00:31:01,393 --> 00:31:02,826
Then do it.

603
00:31:02,828 --> 00:31:05,863
That's what you came here
for, isn't it?

604
00:31:05,865 --> 00:31:07,197
An eye for an eye?

605
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:11,068
Oh, Joe.

606
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:14,271
I want so much more
than an eye.

607
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,641
I often forget
how important it is

608
00:31:17,643 --> 00:31:19,309
To step away
from my ever present routine.

609
00:31:19,311 --> 00:31:20,811
Thank you, Caitlin.

610
00:31:20,813 --> 00:31:23,046
This morning has been
a refreshing change of pace.

611
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:25,315
You can have more
than two hard-boiled eggs

612
00:31:25,317 --> 00:31:27,484
For breakfast, Dr. Wells.

613
00:31:27,486 --> 00:31:29,586
What can I say?
I guess I'm a creature of habit.

614
00:31:29,588 --> 00:31:31,421
Oh, I'm sorry,
I believe these were to-go.

615
00:31:31,423 --> 00:31:34,825
Actually, I thought we could
sit here and enjoy them.

616
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:41,031
Why not?

617
00:31:41,033 --> 00:31:45,102
We've seen what Mardon can do,
but do not forget,

618
00:31:45,104 --> 00:31:46,670
He is not invincible.

619
00:31:46,672 --> 00:31:48,171
I can't believe
this is happening.

620
00:31:48,173 --> 00:31:50,107
He is still a man,
at best, a criminal.

621
00:31:50,109 --> 00:31:51,541
We'll find him.

622
00:31:51,543 --> 00:31:52,576
We will find this dirt bag...

623
00:31:52,578 --> 00:31:55,779
Hey, look at me, all right?

624
00:31:55,781 --> 00:31:58,482
I promise I will bring him
back to you.

625
00:31:58,484 --> 00:31:59,683
Whatever you need to do...

626
00:31:59,685 --> 00:32:00,951
Okay.

627
00:32:00,953 --> 00:32:05,289
I want you all to scour
this city until we find Joe.

628
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:09,793
Move out!

629
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:15,499
Hello?

630
00:32:15,501 --> 00:32:17,901
I have your father.

631
00:32:17,903 --> 00:32:21,171
He's a little broken,
but still alive.

632
00:32:21,173 --> 00:32:23,273
If you want him
to stay that way,

633
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:26,209
Come to the waterfront,
south side.

634
00:32:26,211 --> 00:32:28,979
Oh, and Iris,
you tell the police,

635
00:32:28,981 --> 00:32:31,315
Your father's dead.

636
00:32:33,351 --> 00:32:36,553
She's on her way.

637
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:42,793
He has my dad.

638
00:32:42,795 --> 00:32:44,561
He says if I tell anyone,
he'll kill him.

639
00:32:44,563 --> 00:32:46,263
He wants me to meet him
at the waterfront.

640
00:32:46,265 --> 00:32:47,631
All right,
I'm coming with you.

641
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:48,765
Okay.

642
00:32:48,767 --> 00:32:49,967
Let's go.

643
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:52,903
- Barry.
- Hey.

644
00:32:52,905 --> 00:32:54,571
Can I talk to you
for a second?

645
00:32:54,573 --> 00:32:57,107
No, Linda, I'm sorry,
I really can't right now.

646
00:32:57,109 --> 00:32:58,542
Of course not.

647
00:32:58,544 --> 00:33:00,510
Look, it's not like that.
It's an emergency.

648
00:33:00,512 --> 00:33:02,713
I have to go right now.

649
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:09,486
You know, Dr. Wells,
I just...

650
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:11,621
I want to thank you again

651
00:33:11,623 --> 00:33:14,424
For all that you've done
for Ronnie.

652
00:33:14,426 --> 00:33:16,860
One thank you will suffice,
I'm sure.

653
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:28,672
You know, Caitlin,
if Cisco were to adjust

654
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:32,642
The radial velocity parameters
on the S.T.A.R labs satellite,

655
00:33:32,644 --> 00:33:34,077
We might be able
to better detect

656
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:36,480
The vortex of a forming storm,
and if we could detect

657
00:33:36,482 --> 00:33:38,682
Those air updrafts,
no matter where they originate,

658
00:33:38,684 --> 00:33:43,487
No matter how small, we might
be able to locate Mark Mardon.

659
00:33:43,489 --> 00:33:45,789
That's a great idea.

660
00:33:45,791 --> 00:33:47,290
So why don't we go
to S.T.A.R. Labs

661
00:33:47,292 --> 00:33:50,160
And alert Cisco?

662
00:33:50,162 --> 00:33:52,896
Let me just get these to-go.

663
00:33:59,604 --> 00:34:02,873
Hi, could I get these
in to-go cups?

664
00:34:02,875 --> 00:34:04,674
Sure, just a second.

665
00:34:13,284 --> 00:34:16,686
My goals are beyond
your understanding.

666
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:28,632
Dr. Wells,
we meet at last.

667
00:34:28,634 --> 00:34:31,802
My goals are beyond
your understanding.

668
00:34:31,804 --> 00:34:33,703
I can't believe this.

669
00:34:33,705 --> 00:34:37,541
Oh, I'm not like the Flash
at all.

670
00:34:37,543 --> 00:34:41,078
Some would say,
I'm the reverse.

671
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:49,619
Congratulations, Joe.
You're my plus-one today.

672
00:34:49,621 --> 00:34:51,488
Front row seats
to watch everyone

673
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:55,025
And everything you ever loved
destroyed.

674
00:34:56,994 --> 00:35:00,230
Pretty girl too.

675
00:35:00,232 --> 00:35:02,599
Such a shame.

676
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:04,201
Please, she's my daughter.

677
00:35:04,203 --> 00:35:05,602
Clyde was my brother.

678
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:07,804
He's a thief and a murderer.

679
00:35:07,806 --> 00:35:09,606
She's an innocent girl.

680
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:11,575
She'll pay for the sins
of the father then.

681
00:35:11,577 --> 00:35:13,210
Mark...

682
00:35:13,212 --> 00:35:16,046
They'll all pay.

683
00:35:23,422 --> 00:35:26,356
You're incredibly clever, Cisco.

684
00:35:26,358 --> 00:35:29,059
I've always said so.

685
00:35:29,061 --> 00:35:32,129
You're him.

686
00:35:32,131 --> 00:35:33,964
The Reverse-Flash.

687
00:35:33,966 --> 00:35:37,667
You and I have never been
truly, properly introduced.

688
00:35:37,669 --> 00:35:42,772
I am Eobard Thawne.

689
00:35:42,774 --> 00:35:45,909
Thawne?

690
00:35:45,911 --> 00:35:47,611
Like Eddie.

691
00:35:47,613 --> 00:35:51,815
Let's call him
a distant relative.

692
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:56,286
The night that we trapped
the Reverse-Flash,

693
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,320
You almost died.

694
00:35:57,322 --> 00:35:58,555
Mm-hmm.

695
00:35:58,557 --> 00:36:00,557
There were two of you.

696
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:13,904
It's an after-image,

697
00:36:13,906 --> 00:36:17,641
A speed mirage, if you will.

698
00:36:22,648 --> 00:36:25,482
Joe was right.

699
00:36:25,484 --> 00:36:33,123
You were there that night,
15 years ago, in Barry's house.

700
00:36:33,125 --> 00:36:35,158
You killed Nora Allen.

701
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:39,296
It was never my intention
to kill Nora.

702
00:36:39,298 --> 00:36:43,900
I was there to kill Barry.

703
00:36:43,902 --> 00:36:45,735
Why?

704
00:36:45,737 --> 00:36:47,671
You're his friend.

705
00:36:47,673 --> 00:36:49,105
You've been teaching him
how to...

706
00:36:49,107 --> 00:36:53,677
Go faster, I know.
A means to an end.

707
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:55,645
And I'll tell you why.

708
00:36:55,647 --> 00:36:59,749
Because I have been
stuck here,

709
00:36:59,751 --> 00:37:06,456
Marooned here in this place
for 15 long years.

710
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:10,694
And the Flash
and the Flash's speed

711
00:37:10,696 --> 00:37:17,701
Is the key to my returning
to my world.

712
00:37:17,703 --> 00:37:20,937
To my time.

713
00:37:20,939 --> 00:37:26,142
And no one is going to prevent
that from happening.

714
00:37:29,513 --> 00:37:32,148
I can help you.

715
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:36,853
You're smart, Cisco.

716
00:37:36,855 --> 00:37:39,055
But you're not that smart.

717
00:37:41,158 --> 00:37:43,393
Do you know

718
00:37:43,395 --> 00:37:48,164
How hard it has been
to keep all of this from you,

719
00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:53,703
Especially from you?
Because the truth is,

720
00:37:53,705 --> 00:37:57,173
I've grown quite fond of you.

721
00:37:57,175 --> 00:38:02,012
And in many ways,
you have shown me

722
00:38:02,014 --> 00:38:04,748
What it's like to have a son.

723
00:38:10,521 --> 00:38:14,924
Forgive me, but to me,
you've been dead for centuries.

724
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:34,611
What do we do?

725
00:38:34,613 --> 00:38:36,713
He'll find us.

726
00:38:36,715 --> 00:38:39,349
Oh, my god.

727
00:38:42,154 --> 00:38:43,787
Iris, you need to get
out of here, okay?

728
00:38:43,789 --> 00:38:45,121
You need to get as far away
from here as possible.

729
00:38:45,123 --> 00:38:46,790
- I am not leaving you.
- Iris, please!

730
00:38:46,792 --> 00:38:47,924
Listen to me,
ever since the night

731
00:38:47,926 --> 00:38:49,326
That you told me
how you felt,

732
00:38:49,328 --> 00:38:51,661
I have not been able to
stop thinking about you.

733
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:54,197
At first, I was really mad,

734
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:56,032
And then I realized that
the reason that I couldn't

735
00:38:56,034 --> 00:39:00,770
Stop thinking about you
was because I didn't want to.

736
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:04,908
I've never stopped
thinking about you.

737
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:30,734
Aah!

738
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,308
Caitlin.

739
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:40,310
Barry, I need to talk to you.
Dr. Wells, he isn't...

740
00:39:40,312 --> 00:39:42,178
hey, there's no time for that
right now, all right?

741
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:45,215
There is a tsunami
heading for the city.

742
00:39:45,217 --> 00:39:46,950
How do I stop it?

743
00:39:46,952 --> 00:39:50,086
Theoretically, if you can
create a vortex barrier

744
00:39:50,088 --> 00:39:51,688
Along the coastline,
a wall of wind,

745
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:54,491
That would be able to sap
the tidal wave of its energy

746
00:39:54,493 --> 00:39:55,759
Before it hits the city.

747
00:39:55,761 --> 00:39:58,261
By running back and forth.
How fast?

748
00:39:58,263 --> 00:40:00,530
I don't know if you can
run that fast.

749
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:03,933
I am so sorry.

750
00:40:03,935 --> 00:40:07,203
I didn't want you
to find out this way.

751
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:12,342
Go!

752
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:50,413
Aah!

753
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:07,430
Aah!

754
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,889
Taxi!
Taxi!

755
00:41:32,891 --> 00:41:36,192
Oh, come on,
I'm gonna be late!

756
00:41:36,194 --> 00:41:39,195
Oh, boy.

757
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:06,256
Greg, move your head.
