Enjoy the movie(s) / show(s)

2
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,850
Howdy, boys.

3
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,690
Sorry. sorry, sorry, sorry.

4
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:26,560
How are you guys doing? Good?

5
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:30,230
Why don't you go have a smoke
or something, okay?

6
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,150
I got this.

7
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,860
And you guys...

8
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,660
you are the real heroes.

9
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,550
Gentlemen.

10
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:11,750
All clear, boys. Mission accomplished.

11
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:21,010
God bless America.

12
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,100
Captain.

13
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,520
I found this.

14
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:33,610
The Islamic State is not exactly
a hotbed of scientific expertise.

15
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,700
But they've counterfeited

16
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,530
this Compound V shit of yours?

17
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:43,330
It seems that way, Mr Secretary.

18
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,750
How did they get the formula?

19
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:48,460
Honestly, we have no idea.

20
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,880
Well, you must have some idea.

21
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,880
Some tourist shoplift it from your lab?

22
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,170
Or maybe an inside job?

23
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,890
Sir, we would like to get to the
bottom of this as much as you would.

24
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:06,810
Ms Stillwell, if I had my way,
the Justice Department

25
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:08,930
would haul your smug, tennis-toned ass

26
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:12,360
into Congress and make you testify

27
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,360
to corporate fraud.

28
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,690
What is Lockheed Martin's
number one product?

29
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:19,820
Sorry?

30
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,530
Its top seller.

31
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:25,160
You should know this,
you served on their board of directors.

32
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,160
- The Patriot missile.
- Correct.

33
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,790
Northrop?

34
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,210
B-2 Stealth.

35
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,790
General Dynamics?

36
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:34,590
Tomahawk and the M1 Abrams.

37
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:37,670
Billions of dollars of
bleeding-edge hardware.

38
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,090
Do you know what all
of that is as of today?

39
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,970
A worthless pile of shit.

40
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:48,600
Because Naqib and other
super terrorists like him

41
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,350
can flick away that
junk like flicking a flea.

42
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,310
So it doesn't matter
where heroes really come from.

43
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,280
Frankly, it doesn't even matter
how the enemy got the Compound V.

44
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,110
What matters is they've got it.

45
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,570
It is a whole new world now.

46
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:11,580
And there is only one company
that has the product to fight back.

47
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,550
My company.

48
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,340
My product.

49
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:25,140
What can I say? The Pentagon's agreed
to keep Compound V classified.

50
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,510
Classified?

51
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,060
What the fuck are you on about?

52
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,810
Because of the Naqib
asshole that is out there,

53
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:33,020
we have to keep Vought happy now.

54
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,900
Vought are the ones that
fucking created the cunt.

55
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,480
- We have no solid proof on that.
- No hard proof?

56
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,650
I fucking well rescued
the proof from a basement.

57
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:43,570
She's sitting on a bloody bog as we speak.

58
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,240
Listen. Listen.

59
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,490
Vought's manufacturing super villains.

60
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,080
It's the story of the century.

61
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,290
Don't you want a fucking Pulitzer?

62
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:54,330
Well, fuck you, too, then.

63
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:09,810
Susan, come on.

64
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:12,930
There must be something
we can do here, yeah?

65
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:16,020
Look, the military deal
is signed and sealed.

66
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:19,150
Do you think one mute girl
is going to derail that?

67
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:21,030
Especially coming from the fugitives

68
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:23,440
- that killed Translucent?
- Fugitives?

69
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:27,910
Vought insisted and... And the DOJ agreed.

70
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,070
You're wanted men now.

71
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,080
Hello?

72
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,330
This isn't a day spa.

73
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:34,160
Other people got to use the facilities.

74
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,650
Look, I gave you the V.

75
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,860
I gave you everything
you asked for and more.

76
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,280
I trusted you, and this is
the fucking thanks I get.

77
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,660
Butcher, I will still
protect your families.

78
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,030
Yeah, and keep your
bleeding career even safer.

79
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,410
Well, what about me and the Boys, then?

80
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:14,580
You cut bait and run for your lives.

81
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,410
I'm sorry.

82
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,960
Yeah.

83
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,380
Right.

84
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,300
All right, then, love.

85
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:29,130
Well, that's all under control, isn't it?

86
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,970
We need to split up.

87
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,720
Oi, what the fuck are you doing?

88
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,020
We ain't done yet.

89
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,190
The hell we ain't. We got Vought,
the Supes, and the feds on our asses.

90
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,480
I'm going to Montreal.

91
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,060
How you gonna get
your crazy-ass girlfriend over the border?

92
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:43,980
She has a name.

93
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,730
It's Kimiko. Okay?

94
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,240
- Kimiko.
- Oi, listen.

95
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,650
Shut your fucking traps.

96
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,740
We're on the verge of nailing these cunts.

97
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:54,870
And you want to cut bait and run
before we've played our final card.

98
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,540
Okay, what is it, man?

99
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:00,670
Give us a couple hours. Yeah?

100
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,460
Hughie, you're with me.

101
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:04,840
Come on, son.

102
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,590
Chop-chop.

103
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,230
Annie.

104
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,900
You scared me.

105
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,990
You didn't say you were coming.

106
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:34,700
I hid this under my floorboards
right after Daddy left.

107
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:40,370
I thought that maybe he would come back
for it, but...

108
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,790
- Still smells like him.
- It was a bad habit.

109
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,460
His father smoked a pipe,
so, you know...

110
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,800
What's Compound V?

111
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,260
Compound V?

112
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:54,010
I don't know, sweetheart. Should I?

113
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,520
How old was I?

114
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:07,940
How old was I when you let
Vought pump me full of drugs?

115
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:10,110
- Annie, honestly, I don't know what...
- How old

116
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,360
when you let them turn me into a freak?

117
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,280
You're not a freak.

118
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:15,490
Never say that.

119
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,410
So it's true.

120
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,170
Annie...

121
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:32,720
My God. My God.

122
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:43,520
- Did Vought tell you all this?
- No. No. A friend told me.

123
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:49,610
How much did they pay you?

124
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:53,490
- It wasn't about money.
- How much?

125
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:58,490
There was no money. They just
paid for the medical bills, that's it.

126
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,910
I did it because they, they promised

127
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:04,160
that you'd have a chance
at an extraordinary life.

128
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:09,750
To be strong and successful and special. I
mean, who wouldn't want that for their...?

129
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,670
You made me think that I was chosen by God.

130
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,760
You were!

131
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,550
God brought Vought into our lives.
He made this possible.

132
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,390
Bullshit!

133
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,390
You did!

134
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:24,600
And then you controlled
every single minute of it.

135
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,770
You woke me up at 5 a.m.

136
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:29,190
to train for those stupid pageants,

137
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:32,900
and the tap dancing and the tae kwon do.

138
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:35,030
I gave up every moment of my life.

139
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:37,070
And I was happy to do it.

140
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,030
- This was our dream.
- This was your dream!

141
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,620
I never got a chance
to choose my own dreams.

142
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:46,170
No wonder I don't know who
the fuck I'm supposed to be!

143
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,790
Annie.

144
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,380
Was it really bad investments?

145
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:59,510
- What?
- You told me that Daddy left

146
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,350
because he lost all of our savings.

147
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:08,770
He agreed to all of it.

148
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:13,030
And then, one day, he didn't,

149
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:15,280
so he walked out on us.

150
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:22,870
Maybe he didn't want to lie to me.

151
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:24,830
So I'm the monster?

152
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,210
You have a good life.

153
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,960
People would give
anything to be what you are.

154
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,170
I thought I did what was right.

155
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:37,220
Annie, Annie.

156
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,510
Annie! Annie!

157
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:43,260
It's time to knock back some
of this per diem, buddy.

158
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:46,640
It's a pretty fancy bottle.

159
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:49,190
What are we celebrating?

160
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:51,730
What are you talking about?
The Seven getting called up.

161
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,070
Yeah.

162
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:57,900
You know the whole
reason the Navy discontinued

163
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,780
their sea mammal mine clearance programme?

164
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:04,030
It's because it cost way too much
to train the fucking dolphins.

165
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,830
Yeah.

166
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,370
But with me onboard,

167
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:09,830
it's like a pick-up game of basketball.

168
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:14,920
I've always wanted to
lead my own unit, Jeff.

169
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,090
It's like a dream come true for me.

170
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,850
Smells like a comeback.

171
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,810
Anyways...

172
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:30,230
Cheers, buddy.

173
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:31,480
So, when?

174
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,730
When, what?

175
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,940
When do I ship out?

176
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,740
Gosh.

177
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,410
You know that water park's
opening up a new splash zone,

178
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:45,370
and they are real excited
to have you cut that ribbon.

179
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,710
You know, I'm seriously leaving, Jeff.

180
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,000
Fuck Ohio.

181
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:55,880
Here's the sitch.

182
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,880
I talked to New York.

183
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,880
And... you're not.

184
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:03,550
So much.

185
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,680
Leaving.

186
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,020
What?

187
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,230
They didn't share details.

188
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:13,980
But hey, look...

189
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:18,980
the boys in Marketing have
created a primo tag for you:

190
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:22,200
The Saviour of Sandusky!

191
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,910
That has a nice ring, doesn't it?

192
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,110
William.

193
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:07,450
What are you looking at out there?

194
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:09,160
Eastern meadowlarks.

195
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,870
It was either bird-watching
or alcoholism, so...

196
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,500
birds.

197
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:18,710
I thought we agreed that you
were never going to come out here.

198
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:21,960
Yeah, well, you taught me a thing or two

199
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:24,590
about broken promises.

200
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,680
Didn't you?

201
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,010
This is Hugh Campbell.

202
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:34,100
We're working with M.M. and Frenchie.

203
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,850
I got the Boys back together.

204
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,650
Grace Mallory.

205
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:39,650
I'm the founder of your little club.

206
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:42,990
- You're...
- So, let me hear it.

207
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,410
I need your help.

208
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:49,570
Sorry, I can't.

209
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:52,540
I'm hoping to photograph
a snowy owl in the dunes.

210
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:55,910
Look...

211
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,880
I didn't want to come here,

212
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,130
but I need your help.

213
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:04,050
And you're going to fucking help.

214
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,430
Why's that?

215
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:16,140
Because you owe me.

216
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,600
You fucking owe me, goddamn it.

217
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:16,500
Look at you, mon coeur.

218
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,420
Run! Run!

219
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:50,900
Who's got eyes on her?

220
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:52,410
Over here!

221
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,420
Good job.

222
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,920
We won't let her get away.

223
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:12,510
This is Alpha Team. Suspect is in custody.

224
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:15,100
There's simply nothing else to say.
I can't help you.

225
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,930
You're gonna have to do better than that.

226
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:20,100
- Do I? Why?
- Because you made me a promise.

227
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:24,690
But then my grandchildren got incinerated.
Tends to change one's perspective.

228
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:26,060
There weren't even teeth left,

229
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:29,110
Lamplighter had burnt
them alive so thoroughly.

230
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,780
Well,

231
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,240
I think I've had enough sun for one day.

232
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,700
Pleasure meeting you, Hugh.

233
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,830
Butcher.

234
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,040
Well, what about what you've done?

235
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,130
What I've done?

236
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,920
To who?

237
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:54,800
To me, goddamn it. To me.

238
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:57,050
You trained me up, manipulated me,

239
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,510
aimed me at Homelander
like a fucking howitzer.

240
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,810
And then when it didn't suit you anymore,
you just threw me away.

241
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:05,310
And not a day goes by I don't regret it.

242
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,440
Day late, dollar short, love.

243
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:12,820
Now, I'm going to finish what you started,

244
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:15,320
and I need your help.

245
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:20,990
Please.

246
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,630
You can leave with something,

247
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:32,590
if you never come back

248
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:35,130
and you keep your
goddamn promise this time.

249
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,600
Madelyn Stillwell.

250
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,930
Vought's VP?

251
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:45,270
- Homelander's her main account.
- Yeah, that ain't news.

252
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:47,190
No, but this is:

253
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:51,780
They have a... What shall we say?
A very special relationship.

254
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:54,860
Complicated, intimate, hard to quantify.

255
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,200
And you know this how?

256
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,410
Still have a few fingers in a few pies.

257
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:00,580
I don't know if Homelander has a weakness,

258
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,750
but if he does, she'll know it.

259
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:11,460
Goodbye, Grace.

260
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,970
You want to kill
yourself, that's your right...

261
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:19,890
I won't stop you, but,
Billy, not the others.

262
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,430
Vengeance isn't a path to glory, Hugh.

263
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,730
It's a one-way ticket to a dead end,

264
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:30,610
looking at fucking birds.

265
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,540
No, go ahead. Sure.

266
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:15,940
- Dude. Dude, it's A-Train.
- Really?

267
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,240
It's fucking A-Train.

268
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,160
- Can I help you?
- I'm just keeping an eye out.

269
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,420
That's funny, it really looks like
you're only keeping an eye on me.

270
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,670
You know I'm A-Train, right?

271
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:37,630
Yeah, and I'm Homelander.

272
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,090
Dude, whip back to A-Train.

273
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,430
Listen, I'm sorry about that.

274
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,180
We're good.

275
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:52,690
Wait, so now that you...?
Now you know I'm A-Train, now we're good?

276
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:56,070
Listen, man, I'm sorry. It was my mistake.

277
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:59,070
Yeah, you're damn right it's your mistake.

278
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:00,490
I'm A-Train.

279
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:03,410
I'm the fastest fucking man alive!

280
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:08,790
What are you all fucking looking at?

281
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:17,670
- You missed it.
- Eyes front.

282
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,220
Eyes fucking front, Hughie.

283
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,800
- Boys are gone.
- What?

284
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,760
Someone's grabbed them.

285
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,470
Yeah? How do you know that?

286
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:29,100
The window's new, the path is scrubbed, and
there's a black van with "Flowers" on it,

287
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,020
probably full of cunts waiting to jump us.

288
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,440
- Vought?
- Nah, someone else doing

289
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,270
their dirty work for them,
probably some fed black ops unit.

290
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:45,490
Okay. Okay, what are we...?
What are we gonna do?

291
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:47,200
How are we gonna get the guys back?

292
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,660
We're on our own.
We've got to get to Stillwell

293
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:52,120
- before the walls close in.
- Who gives a fuck?

294
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,830
- We have to go back.
- You don't get it.

295
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,460
We got about a couple hours before
they find us, and that's if we're lucky.

296
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:00,170
We got to hit back and hit back now.

297
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,670
You're abandoning them.

298
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,720
I mean, they all... They risked their...

299
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,760
Mother's Milk has a daughter.

300
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:09,350
- They'd want us to finish the job.
- Your job.

301
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,640
Your job, not theirs.

302
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:16,270
It's all about Homelander, isn't it?

303
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:19,570
And A-Train. This is your
fucking shit, too, Hughie.

304
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:21,940
I promised you payback, didn't I?

305
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:25,280
Mallory give you the same speech
back in the day?

306
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,410
Yeah. Yeah, she did.

307
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:29,530
But she broke her promise.

308
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:30,660
I'm keeping mine.

309
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:35,080
I'm so fucking stupid.

310
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,250
You never cared about me.

311
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,960
Or Robin, did you?

312
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:43,010
I was just useful to you.

313
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,680
Fuck, Hughie. Of course you're useful.

314
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:49,430
I mean, that's why you're here, isn't it?

315
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:52,520
Now we just got to take one more step.

316
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,440
Yeah?

317
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,520
Come on.

318
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,730
No.

319
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:01,900
We have to save them.

320
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:06,400
For fuck's sakes, Hughie, we don't
have time for this shit right now, okay?

321
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:08,780
We get Stillwell. Now,
get in the fucking car.

322
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:09,990
Then what?

323
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,700
Becca comes back from the dead?
Robin, too?

324
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,410
This is never gonna stop,
it's just gonna be more blood

325
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,250
and... awfulness.

326
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:22,340
That's the fucking game.

327
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:25,550
If you don't like to play,
why did you join the fucking team?

328
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,760
Mallory's right, you're just
gonna drag us all down with you.

329
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,850
Not me.

330
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:35,140
Not anymore.

331
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,940
You're a fucking pathetic cunt

332
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:43,530
and an insult to Robin's memory.

333
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:47,070
I think I'm doing this for her.

334
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,490
Goodbye, Hughie.

335
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:37,870
Fucking idiot.

336
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,500
Stupid fucker.

337
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,590
Fuck.

338
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:56,010
Idiot.

339
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:08,070
Fuck.

340
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:10,450
Stupid fucking idiot.

341
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,330
I remember you telling me
you like to come here to listen

342
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:09,000
to the choir rehearse,
so I figured I'd take a shot.

343
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,380
You've got a lot of balls.

344
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,510
Just two.

345
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:16,220
I mean, you must want me to arrest you.

346
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,350
Actually...

347
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,730
Annie... I need your help.

348
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,410
- Please just listen to me.
- Why?

349
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:38,530
More awful secrets you want to tell me,

350
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,790
more drugs that I was dosed
with as a kid, maybe?

351
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:43,790
That just came out. I'm sorry.
I thought you wanted to know the truth.

352
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:46,250
Okay, so you're all about the truth.

353
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:50,290
Vought is giving Compound V to
some bad fucking people, like really bad.

354
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,170
Like, that Supe terrorist.

355
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,010
That's insane.

356
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:57,590
No, it's true.

357
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,050
Look, my friends want to stop it,
but they got caught

358
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,850
on Vought's orders, and I figured,

359
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:06,060
because you had security clearance,

360
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,940
maybe you could help find them.

361
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:14,280
Hughie, I was almost arrested
just for knowing you.

362
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,410
I had to convince them that I was an idiot
that you threw out

363
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:21,330
and you used, and now you want me
to help your psycho killer friends?

364
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:23,160
When you put it like that...

365
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,710
You have 30 seconds
to get the hell out of here.

366
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,590
Okay.

367
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:36,420
I'm sorry to bother you.

368
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:43,930
I mean, why the hell would I ever help you?

369
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,730
Because Vought's up to some evil shit?

370
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,030
Because it's your job.

371
00:26:57,610 --> 00:26:59,240
Because you're a superhero.

372
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,990
Really?

373
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,370
I can't remember the
last time I saved anyone.

374
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,960
You saved me.

375
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,170
When did I ever save you?

376
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,460
Bowling alley.

377
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:19,720
What are you talking about?

378
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:26,850
I was angry after Robin.

379
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:31,810
I was headed for this cliff,
and then you and me went bowling.

380
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,070
Bowling?

381
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:36,400
Yeah.

382
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,820
Bowling.

383
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,030
That's it.

384
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:45,080
That's not saving you,
that's just being there.

385
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,590
The thing is...

386
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:05,760
I don't care.

387
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:37,090
Hey!

388
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:39,380
What the hell are you doing?

389
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:43,050
Doc said six weeks minimum
after a fracture like that.

390
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:44,430
I'm all good, man.

391
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:45,850
Look, I'm back to training.

392
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:48,140
I feel fucking great.

393
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,970
- You're healed?
- I'm healed.

394
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,600
How the fuck are you...?

395
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,690
You back on that Compound V.

396
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:58,190
You promised me that you would stay clean.

397
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:00,280
No. I am clean.

398
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,700
A-1, all-natural A-Train, baby.

399
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:06,030
Your fucking bones fused back
together overnight?

400
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,530
- That sound natural to you?
- Maybe I'm just strong.

401
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:12,250
- Yeah.
- I am the world's fastest man.

402
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,880
Bet you can't outrun this.

403
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,380
Hey. Wait, hey, where you going?

404
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:23,840
I'm not gonna sit here and
watch you kill yourself.

405
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:28,100
You know what? I don't need this shit.

406
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:32,390
You've always just been jealous of me,
so go ahead, slow-ass fucking loser.

407
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:12,850
I'm just, yeah, I'm just gonna...

408
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,530
- There he is!
- Our hero.

409
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,330
Stop it.

410
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:34,000
Stop, please.

411
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,300
Amazing. Great job, everybody.

412
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,180
- You're gonna make me blush here.
- Madelyn?

413
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:51,510
- Stop, please.
- Mr Edgar.

414
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,430
I didn't know you were gonna come.

415
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:55,140
Let me borrow you for a moment.

416
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:11,870
The Pentagon's shelling out
north of $40 billion per year.

417
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:14,620
You should enjoy a
bonus that reflects that.

418
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,370
I don't know what to say.

419
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,080
Well, say thank you.

420
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,710
Thank you.

421
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:23,130
Don't get too excited.

422
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:24,710
It comes with strings.

423
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,210
You're gonna need to move
your office down to 82.

424
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,590
- That's your floor.
- And...

425
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:31,590
I'm gonna want you to start
riding shotgun on my meetings.

426
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,430
Hey, don't go planning my retirement yet.

427
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:38,180
I'm just saying, someone needs to run
this shit show when I move to Belize.

428
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:40,140
Enjoy yourself, Madelyn.

429
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:43,110
Start thinking about the view from 82.

430
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,610
Thank you.

431
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:01,250
Electricity goes in, blast comes out.

432
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,960
That's a hell of a party trick.

433
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:11,130
Do you ever use it for fun?

434
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:14,140
Can I tell you a secret?

435
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:19,100
Sometimes, my eyes light up when I...

436
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:21,390
you know.

437
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,780
Will you excuse me?

438
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,820
Just a second.

439
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,210
You want me to hold your hair back?

440
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,130
Don't touch.

441
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,300
Leave me alone, I'm not in the mood.

442
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,140
Not in the mood for what?

443
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,890
Your bottomless casual cruelty.

444
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:05,100
So just make whatever shitty comment
you're gonna make and then go.

445
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,240
Look.

446
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,990
What am I supposed to be looking at?

447
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:23,120
No... my radius never healed straight.

448
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:29,170
I really did break every
bone in my right arm.

449
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:31,920
- What?
- Stopping the bus from falling.

450
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,510
You said the Marketing guys made it up.

451
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:37,550
It was me.

452
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,140
Twenty-three-year-old, bright-eyed,

453
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,810
ass you could bounce a quarter off of...

454
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:45,140
me.

455
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:52,070
I really did want to make a difference.

456
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:54,320
I really did care.

457
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,200
I was just like you.

458
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,740
And then...

459
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:03,370
I started giving pieces of myself away...

460
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,580
and I guess I gave away everything.

461
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,050
So you know what? Be...

462
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:20,010
Just be original.

463
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,310
For fuck's sake.

464
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:25,810
My position is already taken.

465
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:33,860
Be the annoying goody two-shoes
asshole that you are.

466
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:38,990
One of us has to be.

467
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,770
You've been avoiding me.

468
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:14,690
- No, I haven't.
- Really?

469
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,150
Seems that way.

470
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:21,490
You do know that I went to see Vogelbaum,
though...

471
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:22,950
right?

472
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:27,120
And you do know what he told me?

473
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,870
I never meant for you to find out that way.

474
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,920
Let me guess.
You wanted to protect me.

475
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Well, we all did.

476
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:36,670
Of course.

477
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,630
You think I'm fragile?

478
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,340
No, I do not.

479
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,100
You try doing any of this...

480
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:47,270
I mean fucking any of it.
Without me.

481
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,520
I couldn't.

482
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,860
Madelyn.

483
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:58,070
Did it ever occur to you...

484
00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:00,450
that a Supe terrorist showing up

485
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:03,320
exactly when we needed him to was...

486
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:07,080
a pretty fucking incredible coincidence?

487
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,670
It's almost like...

488
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:13,460
someone planned it.

489
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,510
Me.

490
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:25,180
Me.

491
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,640
I made him.

492
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:31,270
What do you mean you "made him"?

493
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:34,480
Well, I borrowed some Compound V,

494
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,570
had A-Train run it all over the globe,

495
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:40,490
and I supercharged some jihadis.

496
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:45,200
Not to oversimplify it.

497
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:49,870
I mean, it was actually very difficult
and very messy, using adult subjects.

498
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:53,210
There's a good reason
that Vought doesn't do it.

499
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:58,630
But... well, enough survived
to call the operation a huge success.

500
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:01,840
Huge.

501
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,800
And now...

502
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:08,970
we have villains all over the globe...

503
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:12,100
that only we can fight.

504
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:16,400
In sequel after sequel...

505
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,570
after sequel.

506
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:24,820
Well?

507
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:29,830
Say something.

508
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:53,390
No.

509
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:58,690
Take off your pants.

510
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,710
Sit down.

511
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,280
- Gentle.
- I'm...

512
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,990
No.

513
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:57,710
My sweet boy.

514
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:02,170
My special, special, sweet boy.

515
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,840
I'm gonna take care of you.

516
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:15,100
I'm sorry.

517
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:17,350
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

518
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:19,690
- No, you did good.
- I'm sorry.

519
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:21,060
My boy.

520
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:24,570
I'm proud of you.

521
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:26,900
That was so lovely.

522
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:32,820
Well, you know, in mediaeval times,

523
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:35,870
they locked prisoners
inside a pillory barrel.

524
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:41,420
Then they'd kneel in their own excrement
till they got sepsis and died, so...

525
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:45,210
Thank you, Frenchie,

526
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:48,760
for that disgusting
yet fascinating piece of trivia.

527
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,880
I'm just saying it could be worse?

528
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:52,470
Right.

529
00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:01,100
Why didn't you tell us?

530
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,600
Tell you what?

531
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:05,400
That you had a daughter.

532
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,070
I don't know.

533
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:13,990
I mean...

534
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:17,080
I guess she's...

535
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:21,710
the only good thing I ever did, man.

536
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:27,000
I just wanted just to leave her
clean out of it, you know?

537
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:30,920
But I fucked that up to high heaven.

538
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,930
Probably never see her again.

539
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:36,760
I understand.

540
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,390
She made you a better person.

541
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,400
Hey, man.

542
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,490
Kimiko's gonna be okay.

543
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:56,070
So you do know her name.

544
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,450
Do you like that?

545
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:02,040
No.

546
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:13,340
Mr Edgar came to the party tonight
and he practically offered me his job.

547
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:16,890
Well, not right away. But he...

548
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:20,520
wants me to move to the 82nd floor
so that I can be closer to him.

549
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,390
Really?

550
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,190
Okay, but you'll still
be my day-to-day, right?

551
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:29,270
Yeah. Yeah, of course. Of course.

552
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:32,860
I will be there for you always.

553
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,490
Okay, good.

554
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:38,160
Good.

555
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:42,700
Madelyn.

556
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:45,960
From now on, no more secrets.

557
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:51,460
- Promise me.
- I promise.

558
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:53,760
No more secrets.

559
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,680
Okay.

560
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:03,930
I'm sorry that I didn't
tell you about your baby.

561
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:07,020
It's just that...

562
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,980
you carry so much...

563
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:14,440
and the pain of losing a child to...

564
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:16,780
miscarriage is...

565
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,580
I just wanted to spare you that burden.

566
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:23,950
Do you understand?

567
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,620
Yes.

568
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:54,110
What the fuck?

569
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,080
Hey, easy with him, man.

570
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,870
Fuck wrong with you? Shit.

571
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:13,380
- Bitch ass.
- You okay? You break any bones?

572
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:14,590
- No, no. No.
- No?

573
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:15,960
Did they get Butcher, too?

574
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:18,090
- No.
- They got you separated?

575
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:19,760
When? When?

576
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:20,970
Well...

577
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:23,050
he went after Homelander.

578
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:24,350
But I...

579
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:26,640
I came to save you.

580
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:32,980
So, you came here?
You meant to come here?

581
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:34,780
- Without Butcher.
- Yeah.

582
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:45,200
Never has a man thrown his life away

583
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:47,830
so completely
like you've thrown yours away today.

584
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:48,750
No...

585
00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:52,290
no, what I mean is, you rescuing us

586
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:54,670
is the most useless,
futile gesture I can think of.

587
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:56,590
- Yeah, I got it.
- Unbelievable.

588
00:43:56,670 --> 00:43:59,220
- All right, so what's the plan?
- Okay.

589
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:02,430
All right, so they searched me.

590
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:04,470
Very, very thoroughly.

591
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:07,270
But I managed to Poligrip
in my 12th grade retainer.

592
00:44:07,350 --> 00:44:09,310
- Let me see.
- It looks like a permanent bridge,

593
00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:10,810
- and it totally worked.
- Shit.

594
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:13,310
Frenchie, you can pick a lock
with anything, right?

595
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,110
There's premium metal wire
in this thing.

596
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:17,440
- Come on, take it out.
- Okay, one second.

597
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:20,240
Come on, man. Spit that bitch out.

598
00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:22,410
It's stuck.

599
00:44:22,490 --> 00:44:24,160
- Okay, okay, stand still.
- Wait, what?

600
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,660
- Stand still. Open.
- What...?

601
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:26,740
Open the mouth.

602
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,790
Come on, get up in there, Frenchie.

603
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:33,500
Just go deeper. Just a little deeper.

604
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:35,790
All right, all right, all right, hold...

605
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,000
What the fuck, man?

606
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:39,550
Let me get this. Let me get this.

607
00:44:39,630 --> 00:44:40,760
Relax, okay?

608
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:43,930
- Look. Look, focus. Focus.
- Okay, okay. What?

609
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:46,130
I'm gonna knock that
bitch out your mouth. Okay?

610
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:47,350
We're not at that step yet.

611
00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:48,530
We don't have to do that.

612
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:50,520
It's just gonna sting
a little bit. All right?

613
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:51,600
- Sting?
- On three.

614
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:53,400
- One to three.
- Okay, if you count down...

615
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:55,900
You all right?

616
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:57,940
You okay, buddy?

617
00:44:58,020 --> 00:44:59,150
- Yes.
- Yes!

618
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:01,240
Good job, Hughie.

619
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:25,640
Good night, Ms Stillwell.

620
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,390
Good night, Miles.

621
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:30,560
Maria.

622
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,650
Maria, I'm home.

623
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:41,190
Maria?

624
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,820
Your kid's a sound sleeper.

625
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:53,750
Don't worry.

626
00:45:53,830 --> 00:45:55,420
He's all right.

627
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:57,460
So is the nanny.

628
00:45:57,540 --> 00:46:00,340
She's out the back sleeping off
a little bit of propofol.

629
00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:05,880
Put your phone on the table.

630
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,280
William Butcher.

631
00:46:25,570 --> 00:46:28,030
CIA showed me your file.

632
00:46:29,570 --> 00:46:31,910
- What do you want?
- You know what I want.

633
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:34,370
I don't know how breaking into my home

634
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:37,460
and threatening my child
is gonna get you Homelander.

635
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:38,750
All these years...

636
00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:41,170
I've been searching
for that cunt's weakness.

637
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:43,170
He doesn't have any weakness.

638
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:45,670
- No?
- There isn't a weapon on Earth

639
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,800
that they haven't thrown at him.

640
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,260
They've all failed.

641
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:51,510
That's not what I'm talking about.

642
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:56,940
I'm talking... about you.

643
00:46:57,020 --> 00:46:58,400
Me?

644
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:01,650
Yeah, you're the only thing
he gives two shits about.

645
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:04,820
You're his weakness.

646
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,540
It's a fucking maze.

647
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:16,450
Where is she?

648
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,670
Ready... go on.

649
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:32,970
Mon coeur.

650
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:35,930
Frenchie, what the fuck?

651
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,740
Fuck! Move. Move.

652
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,800
Fuck.

653
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:14,600
- No! God.
- Just stay down.

654
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:24,810
Fuck.

655
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:28,070
She better be fucking worth it.

656
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:29,150
Wait, what?

657
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,030
- You cover him. Cover him!
- Wait, what?

658
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:32,410
No, I don't... I can't do this.

659
00:48:32,490 --> 00:48:36,240
You just pull the
fucking trigger right now!

660
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:36,830
Okay!

661
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:38,540
Sorry! I'm sorry!

662
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:43,290
Shit, it's out, it's out. What do I do?

663
00:48:43,370 --> 00:48:45,540
Take this. Take it.

664
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:47,880
- Reload.
- What the fuck do I know about reloading?

665
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:50,720
- Reload the magazine.
- How do I do that? Okay.

666
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,510
- Let's go.
- Good? It's good.

667
00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:01,980
M.M.! M.M.!

668
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:08,440
M.M.!

669
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:11,530
Go!

670
00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:27,750
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

671
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,250
I'm out.

672
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:33,800
- Shit.
- Drop your weapon!

673
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:35,340
- Okay, okay, okay.
- On your knees.

674
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:37,140
- Don't shoot.
- On your fucking knees!

675
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:39,640
Face the wall!

676
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,560
Hands on your heads!

677
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,520
You came.

678
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:33,530
Like you said...

679
00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:37,360
I'm a fucking superhero.

680
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:42,660
Come on.

681
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:44,330
Hughie, check the doors.

682
00:50:46,370 --> 00:50:47,500
Is it working?

683
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:49,790
- No, no, no.
- Fuck.

684
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,960
Try this.

685
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:53,880
Yes.

686
00:50:56,930 --> 00:50:58,510
- Son of a...
- Go, go, go.

687
00:50:58,590 --> 00:51:01,930
- Go. Go, go, go.
- Holy shit.

688
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:06,350
Shit. Go.

689
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:08,980
- Hughie, let's go.
- Go! I'll be okay. Go.

690
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:18,610
Homelander was right.

691
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:21,280
You are a fucking rat.

692
00:51:23,870 --> 00:51:27,000
And you're the jailbreaker?

693
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:29,040
Are you fucking kidding me?

694
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:32,590
Turn around and walk away, A-Train.

695
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:37,970
- I got this. Go.
- No. I'm the one he wants.

696
00:51:39,050 --> 00:51:40,220
I'm not leaving you.

697
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:52,360
Please, just go.

698
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:55,880
Hughie!

699
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:00,170
You killed the only person I've ever loved.

700
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:03,010
I didn't kill her.

701
00:53:07,890 --> 00:53:09,600
I know.

702
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:12,640
I did.

703
00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:23,910
But it was your fault.

704
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:48,930
Holy shit.

705
00:53:49,010 --> 00:53:50,680
What? What?

706
00:53:52,390 --> 00:53:54,890
I think he's having a heart attack.

707
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:04,530
Fuck.

708
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:06,320
All right.

709
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:13,000
One, two, three.

710
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:15,620
Call an ambulance.

711
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:16,710
One...

712
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:19,210
He'll never stop coming for you.

713
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:21,380
I know.

714
00:54:27,050 --> 00:54:28,470
This is Starlight.

715
00:54:28,550 --> 00:54:31,810
I have a code 78-65. A-Train is down.

716
00:54:31,890 --> 00:54:34,230
I think he's had a heart attack.

717
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,900
You have to go. I'll take over.

718
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:41,900
Hughie, go!

719
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:43,940
Or else you'll get caught.

720
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:27,900
Well, well, well.

721
00:55:29,030 --> 00:55:31,320
About fucking time.

722
00:55:32,950 --> 00:55:35,830
I know you can see through the ceiling.

723
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:39,040
You try to kill me...

724
00:55:40,630 --> 00:55:43,380
and my trigger finger goes soft.

725
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:48,840
Now... why don't you
stop playing rapey Santa...

726
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:51,970
and come down and join us?

727
00:55:58,350 --> 00:56:00,230
Take it easy.

728
00:56:00,310 --> 00:56:02,980
We don't want to upset Teddy, right?

729
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:04,360
What are you doing?

730
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:06,360
Hey, look. Mommy.

731
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:08,780
- You all right? Madelyn...
- No.

732
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:11,570
- Take him upstairs.
- All good. I got it.

733
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:13,780
I got it.

734
00:56:20,330 --> 00:56:22,000
Billy Butcher.

735
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:25,420
You don't mind if I call you Billy, right?

736
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:27,760
You are pretty darn impressive.

737
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:31,680
I mean, especially for,
you know, one of you.

738
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:35,510
See, even now, most people
standing where you are

739
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:38,600
would be pissing their
pants terrified, but you...

740
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:43,900
Sure, your heart's pounding,
but you're not afraid.

741
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:47,230
It's anger.

742
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,570
That's a new one for me.

743
00:56:48,650 --> 00:56:52,110
Homelander, will you please
take the baby upstairs?

744
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:56,160
All because of your lovely wife Becca.

745
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:58,450
Right?

746
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:00,000
Okay. Let's cut the bullshit?

747
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:02,000
You know that we...

748
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:05,840
Bro, not my fault, okay?

749
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,840
- She came on to me. It happens.
- Will you stop?

750
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:12,430
You know, it's the fame. They get crushes.
There's nothing I can do about it.

751
00:57:12,510 --> 00:57:15,680
But what I will tell you is,
she was a hell of a lay.

752
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:19,350
She came three times?

753
00:57:19,430 --> 00:57:20,680
Three times.

754
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:24,690
All right, little man, have
a little lie-down. Good boy.

755
00:57:24,770 --> 00:57:26,480
I want you to take him out of here.

756
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:28,400
There you go.

757
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:35,240
But that's not really it.

758
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:36,620
No, no, no.

759
00:57:37,990 --> 00:57:40,620
No, it's more than just that.

760
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:47,920
You think I'm responsible
for her death, don't you?

761
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:54,720
So now you have a hostage
that I care about, right?

762
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,800
Someone I love.

763
00:57:56,890 --> 00:58:01,350
So, what's your plan... from here?

764
00:58:01,430 --> 00:58:02,520
What do you want?

765
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:05,140
Do you want a confession, or...?

766
00:58:05,230 --> 00:58:06,690
What's your endgame?

767
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:15,240
I'm just gonna hurt you.

768
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,910
I mean really fucking hurt you,

769
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:22,910
and that will be good enough for me.

770
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,580
So, you don't really want anything, per se?

771
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:29,630
You just... You want to blow her
up in front of me.

772
00:58:29,710 --> 00:58:31,670
Right?

773
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:34,970
Wow, fuck.

774
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:43,850
You are dark, and I kind of like it.

775
00:58:43,930 --> 00:58:46,230
Will you please take Teddy upstairs?

776
00:58:46,310 --> 00:58:47,940
It's okay.

777
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:52,400
Just answer one question for me.

778
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:53,780
Just one.

779
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:57,110
How do you know?

780
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:00,740
How do you know?

781
00:59:00,830 --> 00:59:04,200
I mean, you must have
some rock-solid proof, right?

782
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:08,000
That it was actually
me who killed your wife.

783
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:11,960
You must have that, right? So what is it?

784
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:14,960
Share. We're all very interested.

785
00:59:17,130 --> 00:59:20,180
Now's not the time to be strong and silent.

786
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:21,260
Go for it.

787
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:28,190
Are you telling me that this whole thing

788
00:59:28,270 --> 00:59:32,610
is based on fucking feelings?

789
00:59:32,690 --> 00:59:33,980
- On a hunch?
- Will you please

790
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:35,940
- take him upstairs?
- A little bit... Hold on.

791
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:39,360
- Take him upstairs!
- Shut the fuck up!

792
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:44,990
Excuse me.

793
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:50,670
You promised me no more lies.

794
00:59:50,750 --> 00:59:53,840
You fucking promised me.

795
00:59:55,380 --> 00:59:58,970
You and Vogelbaum should have
got your stories straight.

796
00:59:59,050 --> 01:00:01,180
They were so close.

797
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:06,970
So fucking close, but there was a few
little details that were different.

798
01:00:07,060 --> 01:00:09,600
So I went back to Vogelbaum,

799
01:00:09,690 --> 01:00:13,270
and I managed to
squeeze the truth out of him.

800
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:15,440
The real truth.

801
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:22,030
Yes, that's it.

802
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:32,000
I'm so sorry.

803
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:34,790
I should never have lied to you.

804
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:38,840
I know now that you don't need
to be protected.

805
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:41,090
I'm so sorry.

806
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:43,930
Will you please take Teddy upstairs?

807
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:49,520
Did you ever really care about me?

808
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:51,770
You mean everything to me.

809
01:00:51,850 --> 01:00:53,770
No.

810
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:54,770
No, no.

811
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:57,940
I mean everything to your job.

812
01:00:59,610 --> 01:01:01,570
You care more about that fucking baby

813
01:01:01,650 --> 01:01:02,910
- than you do about me.
- No.

814
01:01:02,990 --> 01:01:05,320
I love you.

815
01:01:05,410 --> 01:01:07,280
I love you. I love you. I swear I love you.

816
01:01:07,370 --> 01:01:08,830
But?

817
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:14,710
Tell me the truth, or I walk out right now.

818
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:20,590
I'm scared.

819
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:24,010
I'm scared of you.

820
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:27,560
What?

821
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:29,430
I said I'm scared.

822
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:32,310
- Of?
- Of you.

823
01:01:32,390 --> 01:01:35,190
I'm scared of you.

824
01:01:35,270 --> 01:01:37,060
Thank you.

825
01:01:38,690 --> 01:01:41,780
Thank you for finally being honest.

826
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:33,580
Now...

827
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:38,880
what was that plan again?

828
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:42,420
Well...

829
01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:08,780
Wakey, wakey.

830
01:03:09,990 --> 01:03:11,660
Hey, buddy.

831
01:03:11,740 --> 01:03:13,290
You were out for quite a while.

832
01:03:13,370 --> 01:03:16,870
You can thank me
for saving you sometime later,

833
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,540
but, for now,

834
01:03:18,620 --> 01:03:19,960
time to get up.

835
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:21,420
Come on. You're gonna love this.

836
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:23,210
Come on.

837
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:29,510
Mom!

838
01:03:29,590 --> 01:03:32,510
Wow, look at this handsome devil.

839
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:35,980
Hey, pal.

840
01:03:37,430 --> 01:03:38,600
You know who I am?

841
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:40,060
Homelander.

842
01:03:41,190 --> 01:03:42,770
Yeah, that's right...

843
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:47,280
but you know who else?

844
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:48,450
No.

845
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:57,290
Becca?

846
01:03:57,370 --> 01:03:58,910
What?

847
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Mommy didn't tell you.

848
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,590
Well...

849
01:04:08,510 --> 01:04:10,180
I'm your father,

850
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:15,470
and we are a family.

851
