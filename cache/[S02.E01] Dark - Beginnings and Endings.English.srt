1
00:00:08,666 --> 00:00:14,875
AND IF YOU GAZE LONG INTO AN ABYSS,
THE ABYSS ALSO GAZES INTO YOU.

2
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:29,458
JUNE 21, 1921

3
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:05,208
The beginning

4
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:07,666
and the end.

5
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:12,708
A strange idea

6
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:15,166
that both should be the same.

7
00:01:17,208 --> 00:01:19,250
Sic mundus creatus est.

8
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:23,083
Thus the world was created.

9
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:36,375
Sic

10
00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:38,333
mundus

11
00:01:38,416 --> 00:01:40,458
creatus est!

12
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:56,833
You no longer believe the prophecy?

13
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:03,541
I believe in the irony of fate.

14
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:14,666
Adam says that all things must happen
as they've always happened.

15
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,833
We have to bear the cross,
no matter how heavy it seems.

16
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:22,333
In six days paradise begins
and hell on earth will end.

17
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:24,416
Sometimes I wonder

18
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:26,958
if paradise and hell

19
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,500
are not one and the same thing.

20
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:33,708
Adam was right.

21
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,041
You've lost faith.

22
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:47,708
Is that why he sent you?

23
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:50,791
I've waited a long time for this moment.

24
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:53,958
It's interesting that it's you.

25
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:06,833
I hope that the day comes

26
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:10,333
when you don't believe
everything Adam tells you.

27
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:12,458
Ask him...

28
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:15,125
why he took you in.

29
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:18,875
And why he called you Noah.

30
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:26,666
JUNE 27, 2020
BEGINNING OF THE LAST CYCLE

31
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,458
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

32
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,583
I think we're a perfect match.

33
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:30,666
Never believe anything else.

34
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,250
DO NOT OPEN BEFORE NOVEMBER 4,
10:13 P.M.

35
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:22,000
JUNE 2020

36
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:23,666
27

37
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:50,000
My name is Claudia Tiedemann.

38
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:55,458
I am one of the few survivors
of the apocalypse of June 27, 2020.

39
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:58,333
Almost three months
have passed since the catastrophe.

40
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:02,500
It's still unclear
what exactly led to the events in Winden.

41
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:04,750
But the God Particle...

42
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:09,041
If we can stabilize it,
maybe it is a way back.

43
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:11,958
Back to the past.

44
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:14,625
Maybe we can save them.

45
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:16,083
All of them.

46
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:22,875
JUNE 21, 2020

47
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:26,583
SIX DAYS UNTIL THE APOCALYPSE

48
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:28,250
Wake up, late risers!

49
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:32,208
It's the first week of summer vacation
and it is perfect beach weather.

50
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:33,291
WHERE IS MIKKEL?

51
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,791
Local news.

52
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:38,666
Over six months after the mysterious
disappearance of four teenagers,

53
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:43,000
a senior citizen and a local
police officer from the town of Winden,

54
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:47,750
there are no clues as to their whereabouts
or the circumstances.

55
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:51,750
A federal police task force
will now assist with the investigation.

56
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:58,208
How do you feel today?

57
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:00,791
Still having joint trouble?

58
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:03,208
Nausea?

59
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:06,916
To be honest, your lab results worry me.

60
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,958
We should treat you in the hospital again.

61
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:09,916
No.

62
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:12,208
Absolutely not.

63
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:15,041
-I want to stay here.
-Fine.

64
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:17,416
We'll wait for the next MRI results.

65
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:22,333
We may have to switch
from hormone treatment back to chemo.

66
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:24,708
MARTHA: COME TO THE BRIDGE.

67
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:28,958
He that has eyes to see...

68
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:32,708
and ears to hear...

69
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:35,833
may convince himself that no mortal...

70
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,541
can keep a secret.

71
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:41,041
If his lips are silent,

72
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:43,958
he chatters with his fingertips.

73
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:47,166
Betrayal oozes out of him at every pore.

74
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,041
That was Freud.

75
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:51,958
I'm Clausen,

76
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:54,375
head of the Winden task force.

77
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:58,416
Today I take charge of last year's
unsolved missing persons cases.

78
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:02,916
The task force's aim
is to reopen these cases entirely,

79
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,250
to review all evidence and clues
until we have unearthed the secrets

80
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:11,416
that lie hidden below the surface.

81
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:19,000
Recently, some of you should have received
summons for renewed interrogation.

82
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:22,708
-Yes?
-You said "we." Who do you mean by that?

83
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,750
Myself and Ms. Doppler,

84
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:27,166
who is still assigned to these cases.

85
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,708
That's no task force!

86
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:33,458
Six people have been missing for months.
And that's what they send us?

87
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:35,291
One person?

88
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:37,500
And the woman who found nothing?

89
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:49,583
Ten people

90
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:55,083
who look at an elephant
from ten different angles

91
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:57,625
will give ten different statements...

92
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:01,333
about its shape and appearance.

93
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:04,416
A single person

94
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,750
who sees that same elephant
from those ten different perspectives...

95
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,291
will be able

96
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,666
to piece together those observations

97
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,875
and to draw the only possible conclusion.

98
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:18,791
My son is missing.

99
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:22,708
The next time I need to find an elephant,
I'll let you know!

100
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:24,291
Right!

101
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:30,166
Does your mom talk at home?
About the investigation, I mean.

102
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:32,416
Not to us.

103
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:35,875
We sit around and wait.

104
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:37,875
And nothing happens.

105
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:41,416
We know as little as we did
eight months ago.

106
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:47,208
Sometimes I think it'd be better
if they were dead.

107
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,750
Don't say that.

108
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:15,208
I have to go.

109
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:18,083
Where to?

110
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:20,500
To pick up Elisabeth at a friend's.

111
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:22,666
I'll call you later, okay?

112
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:16,833
I've been trying to reach you for days.

113
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:20,916
A lot was going on.

114
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:26,458
I wanted to talk to you.

115
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:31,291
-I've wanted to for a long time.
-Save your breath.

116
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:35,416
It's probably better that way.

117
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,000
So...

118
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:44,583
that's it then.

119
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:56,166
Because of him?

120
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,416
-Because of Jonas?
-What?

121
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:02,041
What's that got to do with it?

122
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,708
We hardly ever see each other.

123
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,708
I don't know...

124
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:11,625
You've changed.

125
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,500
I...

126
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,458
I feel like you're hiding something.

127
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:24,208
-I don't know what's up with you.
-What's up with me?

128
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:27,000
What the fuck? My mom is dying!

129
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,500
And...

130
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:32,291
-there's stuff I can't tell you.
-Why not?

131
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:34,000
I just can't.

132
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:35,708
Okay?

133
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:38,291
If you knew the crap I'm going through...

134
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:40,875
The crap you're going through?

135
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:44,291
In case you forgot,
my father and brother have disappeared.

136
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:46,833
My mom is crazy
and couldn't care less about me.

137
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:50,000
And you want to tell me about your crap?

138
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,916
It's better this way.

139
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,666
FROM UNKNOWN SENDER:
THIS EVENING.

140
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:39,333
Energy creates community.

141
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:44,333
Nuclear power was, is,
and will remain the only alternative.

142
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:45,666
Nothing is cheaper,

143
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,583
safer, more reliable.

144
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:51,666
But the outside world insists on progress.

145
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:57,833
In six days our plant
will be decommissioned for good.

146
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:02,666
This is a dramatic event for all of us.

147
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:06,708
I would like to thank you
for your loyalty.

148
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:11,000
Without you the Winden nuclear power plant
as we know it

149
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:13,083
could never have existed.

150
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:16,958
Let us, during these last six days,

151
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:19,625
fill it with life
in the spirit of the community.

152
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:44,583
Everything has been prepared for transport
as planned.

153
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:47,458
And the demolition plans?

154
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:52,375
Everything at ground level will be left
and become part of the greenfield.

155
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:56,125
The radiation of the barrels
will be traced to the pool's previous use.

156
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:09,375
PASSPORT

157
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:43,208
Hello?

158
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:52,125
Who are you?

159
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:54,541
What do you want?

160
00:21:57,875 --> 00:21:59,708
Why do you have a key?

161
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:03,291
It's my key.

162
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,875
What do you mean, it's yours?

163
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:13,333
I know it sounds like it makes no sense.

164
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:16,375
But hear me out.

165
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:22,416
Do you remember the yellow bike?

166
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:25,916
The bike you and dad gave me
on my eighth birthday.

167
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,750
I rode it into a ditch the very first day.

168
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:32,458
I gashed my arm open. Here.

169
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:38,833
Get out.

170
00:22:41,541 --> 00:22:42,666
Here.

171
00:22:48,791 --> 00:22:50,708
Dad was making pancakes here.

172
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,125
He dropped the pan
and spilled the hot oil here.

173
00:22:57,208 --> 00:23:00,000
I vanished from your life six months ago.

174
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:02,791
You found me over 33 years ago.

175
00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:06,625
I knew it was you right away.

176
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:08,916
It was raining, remember?

177
00:23:09,583 --> 00:23:11,916
Grandpa and you wanted
to take me along in the car.

178
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:15,333
You said it was still acid rain
because of Chernobyl.

179
00:23:16,708 --> 00:23:18,416
I was wearing my yellow coat.

180
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:26,750
Mom.

181
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:30,208
It's me.

182
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,583
Jonas?

183
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:47,958
But that's impossible.

184
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:08,000
There is no coincidence.

185
00:24:09,166 --> 00:24:11,291
Every path is predetermined.

186
00:24:12,916 --> 00:24:15,625
Everything happens when it must.

187
00:24:16,708 --> 00:24:18,208
At the right time.

188
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:20,750
In the right place.

189
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,750
As if the world was a carpet

190
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:28,375
made up of an endless network
of endless threads.

191
00:24:29,875 --> 00:24:32,083
Each in its place.

192
00:24:32,166 --> 00:24:33,375
CAVE ENTRANCE

193
00:24:34,708 --> 00:24:38,000
But very few of us know
where the journey takes them.

194
00:24:45,166 --> 00:24:46,958
You've taken your first step.

195
00:24:48,333 --> 00:24:50,375
Adam will be proud of you.

196
00:24:53,208 --> 00:24:55,000
I felt the same way.

197
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,000
It will pass.

198
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:03,625
Adam.

199
00:25:05,208 --> 00:25:06,583
Why did he take us in?

200
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:09,708
Things are still hidden from you.

201
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,708
But they will come to light.

202
00:25:12,791 --> 00:25:14,583
Bit by bit.

203
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,875
When the time is right.

204
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:24,541
How do we know what's right
and what's wrong?

205
00:25:26,541 --> 00:25:30,000
What is good and what is evil?

206
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:33,291
By heeding our inner voice.

207
00:25:34,041 --> 00:25:38,833
By not following anyone else
but ourselves.

208
00:25:40,083 --> 00:25:44,708
Our true nature reveals itself not only
in our deeds but also in their purpose.

209
00:25:45,791 --> 00:25:47,041
I am you.

210
00:25:48,375 --> 00:25:49,916
I am your voice.

211
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:53,500
Never forget that.

212
00:25:54,416 --> 00:25:56,083
Everything is connected.

213
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:58,250
You.

214
00:25:59,333 --> 00:26:00,458
Me.

215
00:26:01,375 --> 00:26:02,791
The past.

216
00:26:04,833 --> 00:26:06,291
And the future.

217
00:26:22,541 --> 00:26:24,541
No, no!

218
00:26:27,541 --> 00:26:28,916
Stop!

219
00:26:29,833 --> 00:26:33,125
Who are you?
You are hiding it!

220
00:26:33,208 --> 00:26:35,083
There, behind the wall! We saw it!

221
00:26:35,166 --> 00:26:37,708
We followed the signal.

222
00:26:40,291 --> 00:26:41,958
Till the dead zone.

223
00:26:42,041 --> 00:26:43,958
You're hiding God!

224
00:26:44,041 --> 00:26:46,208
You mustn't hide God.

225
00:26:46,291 --> 00:26:47,875
He's not yours alone!

226
00:26:51,958 --> 00:26:53,708
You mustn't hide God.

227
00:26:53,791 --> 00:26:54,875
No!

228
00:27:11,625 --> 00:27:13,583
No one can enter the dead zone.

229
00:27:14,208 --> 00:27:16,208
Any attempt will be punished by death.

230
00:27:17,083 --> 00:27:18,250
Those are the rules.

231
00:27:20,833 --> 00:27:22,416
We are the future.

232
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,458
Sic mundus creatus est.

233
00:27:24,541 --> 00:27:26,666
Sic mundus creatus est.

234
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,916
Where were you?

235
00:27:52,541 --> 00:27:53,916
There's nothing out there.

236
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:59,083
The passage is our only hope.

237
00:27:59,583 --> 00:28:01,166
The faithless are dead.

238
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:03,666
The prophecy will come true,
the passage will open

239
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,708
and we will be led into paradise.

240
00:28:06,666 --> 00:28:08,375
The faithless are dead?

241
00:28:09,458 --> 00:28:11,833
Everyone is dead, my family, my friends.

242
00:28:11,916 --> 00:28:14,750
Everyone dies in six days, in my time!

243
00:28:15,458 --> 00:28:17,208
I don't need your damn paradise.

244
00:28:17,291 --> 00:28:18,833
I just want to go home.

245
00:28:22,833 --> 00:28:25,208
What did they want behind the wall?

246
00:28:49,458 --> 00:28:52,250
Why did Mom keep it all?

247
00:28:52,333 --> 00:28:55,166
Great-Grandpa died ages ago.

248
00:28:56,041 --> 00:28:58,166
I think because it's the only thing

249
00:28:58,666 --> 00:29:00,833
that reminds her of her family.

250
00:29:00,916 --> 00:29:03,708
Some things are hard to let go of.

251
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:07,375
It's a shame
I never met Grandpa and Grandma.

252
00:29:09,458 --> 00:29:11,208
Does Mom remember them?

253
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:16,083
Your mother was still little
when they died.

254
00:29:17,083 --> 00:29:18,625
Come on.

255
00:29:47,416 --> 00:29:49,041
Were you born here?

256
00:29:49,125 --> 00:29:50,625
My grandfather was.

257
00:29:51,416 --> 00:29:53,291
I grew up with him.

258
00:29:54,583 --> 00:29:56,208
Is your grandfather still alive?

259
00:29:57,333 --> 00:29:58,458
No.

260
00:29:59,416 --> 00:30:01,625
Have you thought it could have been him?

261
00:30:01,708 --> 00:30:04,083
-Who? My grandfather?
-No.

262
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,916
Your colleague, Ulrich.

263
00:30:06,458 --> 00:30:07,458
No.

264
00:30:08,083 --> 00:30:09,291
Why?

265
00:30:09,833 --> 00:30:11,875
He called you shortly before he vanished.

266
00:30:12,875 --> 00:30:15,208
The call lasted exactly 12 seconds.

267
00:30:15,791 --> 00:30:17,625
Probably a voicemail message.

268
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,750
What did he want?

269
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:21,958
Nothing.

270
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,916
He misdialed.

271
00:30:25,291 --> 00:30:27,041
Do you still have the message?

272
00:30:27,958 --> 00:30:29,083
No.

273
00:30:29,791 --> 00:30:31,375
Of course not.

274
00:30:36,875 --> 00:30:38,708
These are the parents' statements.

275
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:44,458
Thanks, Wöller.

276
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,500
You're welcome.

277
00:31:04,375 --> 00:31:06,208
I had an office set up for you.

278
00:31:07,791 --> 00:31:09,208
Just down the hall.

279
00:31:13,625 --> 00:31:16,000
Disappointments are the result
of false expectations.

280
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:20,708
"Have hope," my mom always said,
"and no expectations,

281
00:31:20,791 --> 00:31:24,250
then you might get a miracle
and not a disappointment."

282
00:31:30,708 --> 00:31:32,625
Maybe you expected someone different

283
00:31:33,208 --> 00:31:34,625
and got me.

284
00:31:34,708 --> 00:31:35,833
Coincidence?

285
00:31:36,791 --> 00:31:38,416
I don't believe in coincidence.

286
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:41,458
I think things come together
because they belong together.

287
00:31:53,333 --> 00:31:54,958
Shall we?

288
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:06,833
Mom?

289
00:32:59,875 --> 00:33:01,500
INVESTIGATION FILE

290
00:33:09,958 --> 00:33:12,083
STEEL DOOR?

291
00:33:40,875 --> 00:33:43,333
It's remarkable people don't crack,

292
00:33:43,791 --> 00:33:47,166
given the futility of their own existence.

293
00:33:48,583 --> 00:33:52,416
An endless cycle of life and death.

294
00:33:54,083 --> 00:33:57,833
Where is the origin of all this suffering?

295
00:34:01,291 --> 00:34:03,333
Did you tell Bartosz?

296
00:34:09,375 --> 00:34:11,916
And he didn't get at all suspicious?

297
00:34:15,125 --> 00:34:17,375
He has always been naive by nature.

298
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:34,208
The apocalypse has to happen.

299
00:34:36,791 --> 00:34:38,583
Are you having doubts?

300
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,583
What do you do with an old forest
so new trees can grow?

301
00:34:46,166 --> 00:34:48,000
You burn it down.

302
00:34:48,833 --> 00:34:50,625
There isn't much time left.

303
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:53,583
The missing pages...

304
00:34:55,208 --> 00:34:56,875
you must find them.

305
00:35:02,416 --> 00:35:03,708
Adam?

306
00:35:04,458 --> 00:35:05,958
They're waiting for you.

307
00:35:11,333 --> 00:35:12,916
Six more days.

308
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:52,125
I'm on my break.

309
00:37:01,291 --> 00:37:04,583
Oh, well... Blow job 40 euros, anal 85.

310
00:37:04,666 --> 00:37:07,583
Kinky stuff costs extra.
But I need to eat first.

311
00:37:11,208 --> 00:37:12,333
Get undressed.

312
00:37:25,375 --> 00:37:27,875
You could say I exist infinitely.

313
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,541
I'm here now.

314
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:34,333
And I'm in every second
between my birth and my death.

315
00:37:35,541 --> 00:37:36,833
I'm always Jonas.

316
00:37:37,916 --> 00:37:39,208
I'm the same.

317
00:37:39,875 --> 00:37:41,666
And yet not the same.

318
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:45,416
Like you're not the same person
who came through that door an hour ago.

319
00:37:46,875 --> 00:37:48,125
But where is Jonas?

320
00:37:49,458 --> 00:37:50,916
Where is my Jonas?

321
00:37:54,458 --> 00:37:55,958
He's in the future.

322
00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:59,000
In the future?

323
00:38:00,666 --> 00:38:01,708
Yes.

324
00:38:03,208 --> 00:38:04,791
But he can't come back.

325
00:38:05,458 --> 00:38:08,375
I tried to destroy the passage,
but I only closed it.

326
00:38:09,083 --> 00:38:10,750
That's why he's still there.

327
00:38:19,083 --> 00:38:20,750
Why are you here?

328
00:38:30,833 --> 00:38:34,666
To put an end to it all.
Once and for all.

329
00:39:22,291 --> 00:39:23,541
That's the man!

330
00:39:23,625 --> 00:39:25,416
Which man?

331
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:29,541
The man with the watch. That's Noah!

332
00:39:30,041 --> 00:39:31,166
Noah?

333
00:39:55,958 --> 00:39:58,291
POLICE

334
00:39:58,375 --> 00:40:02,250
Watch out for the tiniest deviations
in their statements.

335
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:03,708
Every detail is important.

336
00:40:10,083 --> 00:40:12,083
PETER: I'VE FOUND NOAH.
COME TO THE BUNKER.

337
00:40:12,166 --> 00:40:13,708
Something wrong?

338
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,416
I have to go.

339
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:20,000
I don't have a driver's license.

340
00:40:20,083 --> 00:40:22,500
I assume it's okay
if I ride with you tomorrow?

341
00:40:22,583 --> 00:40:23,666
Yes.

342
00:41:24,916 --> 00:41:26,291
Mom didn't lock it.

343
00:41:27,333 --> 00:41:28,583
What's that?

344
00:41:29,625 --> 00:41:30,791
Dad's stuff.

345
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:36,125
Police documents and maps of the cave.

346
00:41:37,541 --> 00:41:39,500
That's why Mom goes in there every day.

347
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:43,833
I think she's looking for this.

348
00:41:51,708 --> 00:41:54,583
A door. In the caves?

349
00:41:56,291 --> 00:41:58,083
It goes to the nuclear power plant.

350
00:41:59,666 --> 00:42:02,500
They all know something
we're not supposed to know.

351
00:42:02,583 --> 00:42:04,000
Mom, Bartosz.

352
00:42:04,083 --> 00:42:05,458
The police.

353
00:42:10,541 --> 00:42:12,833
Each with their own shitty secret.

354
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:54,625
Are you ready?

355
00:43:26,541 --> 00:43:28,083
Thanks for the coffee.

356
00:43:44,583 --> 00:43:46,625
I'm glad to get rid of that thing.

357
00:43:58,083 --> 00:44:00,583
Call Mom again. Okay?

358
00:44:18,458 --> 00:44:19,583
Bye.

359
00:44:21,875 --> 00:44:23,000
Bye.

360
00:45:05,625 --> 00:45:07,041
That's Noah.

361
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:13,583
Elisabeth found it, at the store.

362
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:15,750
It was in a book.

363
00:45:16,416 --> 00:45:18,791
She said that's the man
who gave her the watch.

364
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:24,541
"January 8, 1921.

365
00:45:24,625 --> 00:45:28,458
Sic mundus creatus est."

366
00:45:28,541 --> 00:45:31,333
Charlotte, who are these people?

367
00:45:32,208 --> 00:45:34,208
Why did your grandfather have this?

368
00:45:34,291 --> 00:45:35,666
I don't know.

369
00:46:00,791 --> 00:46:01,666
CALL REJECTED

370
00:53:28,041 --> 00:53:33,083
