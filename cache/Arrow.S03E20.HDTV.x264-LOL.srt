00:00:01,128 --> 00:00:02,734
Previously, on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:02,758 --> 00:00:04,109
These waters' powers,

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,136
they have permitted me
to live way beyond my time.

4
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:10,894
I want you to take my place.

5
00:00:10,896 --> 00:00:13,696
I want you to become
the next Ra's al Ghul.

6
00:00:13,698 --> 00:00:17,433
If you insist on pursuing this
path of resistance,

7
00:00:17,435 --> 00:00:18,635
there will be consequences.

8
00:00:18,637 --> 00:00:20,670
Is that a threat?

9
00:00:21,261 --> 00:00:22,722
I am the Demon's Head.

10
00:00:22,723 --> 00:00:25,190
And very soon,
your brother.

11
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:27,225
He will never
take your place.

12
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:28,760
He will.

13
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:06,965
Thea?

14
00:01:06,967 --> 00:01:08,933
Thea?!

15
00:01:09,399 --> 00:01:11,002
Oh, my God,
Thea! Hey!

16
00:01:19,011 --> 00:01:22,801
I...couldn't...stop him.

17
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,183
I need an ambulance
to 455 Merced, Unit 10.

18
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:27,285
Please hurry.

19
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:29,554
Ok, you're
going to be ok.

20
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:31,856
You're going to be ok.

21
00:01:32,548 --> 00:01:35,260
No, Thea, stay
awake! Come on! Up!

22
00:01:39,965 --> 00:01:41,135
Hang on, we're almost there.

23
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:42,268
How long was she like this?

24
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:44,302
Uh, 20 minutes, 40,
I don't know, I just found her.

25
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:45,603
- You need to stay here.
- I'm not going to leave her!

26
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,772
You need
to let us work.

27
00:01:48,874 --> 00:01:51,843
Get me a set
of vitals. Lift.

28
00:01:53,858 --> 00:01:55,292
Charge up to 200 joules.

29
00:01:55,316 --> 00:01:56,352
Charging.

30
00:02:00,563 --> 00:02:02,117
Clear.

31
00:02:02,141 --> 00:02:02,890
No response.

32
00:02:02,891 --> 00:02:05,406
Draw up one milligram EPI,
charge to 200.

33
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,991
Charging.

34
00:02:07,015 --> 00:02:07,760
Ready.

35
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:09,193
Clear.

36
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:13,865
Start CPR.

37
00:02:16,158 --> 00:02:17,502
Come on.

38
00:02:19,797 --> 00:02:20,972
Come on, stay with us.

39
00:02:34,246 --> 00:02:38,246

We did the best we could
under the circumstances,

42
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:01,780
but her injuries
were extensive.

43
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:04,582
Even if she were
to regain consciousness,

44
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:06,785
we can prolong her life
for as long as you wish.

45
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:11,423
But...it might be best
to consider other options.

46
00:03:13,228 --> 00:03:15,626
I am truly sorry,
Mr. Queen.

47
00:03:19,507 --> 00:03:20,764
May I see her?

48
00:03:56,635 --> 00:03:59,103
Sorry.

49
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:03,274
Oliver...

50
00:04:21,892 --> 00:04:23,559
Thea.

51
00:04:33,138 --> 00:04:34,472
What are they doing?

52
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:36,708
They're
unloading the truck,

53
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,476
and, um,

54
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:39,844
having dinner.

55
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:42,480
General Shrieve is there.

56
00:04:43,315 --> 00:04:45,416
The Alpha,

57
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:48,520
the Omega,
he's combining them.

58
00:04:56,425 --> 00:04:57,946
The bio weapon is armed.

59
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:58,831
What happens now?

60
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:00,665
Now he'll take it somewhere
to be released.

61
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:03,301
Somewhere densely populated
where it will have the most impact.

62
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,669
We need to stop
that truck.

63
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:07,205
Where's Oliver?

64
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:09,340
Come on!

65
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:10,675
You stole a car?

66
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:12,510
I borrowed it.
Come on.

67
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,458
Oh, my God.
Oliver!

68
00:05:29,194 --> 00:05:30,862
Oliver, we came
as soon as we could.

69
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:33,498
What happened?

70
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,999
Oliver.

71
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:38,236
They just
left her there.

72
00:05:38,924 --> 00:05:40,438
To die.

73
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,041
Oliver, is--is she?

74
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:45,143
It's bad.

75
00:05:56,968 --> 00:05:59,223
What is it?

76
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:01,426
Smoke.

77
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:04,462
The League?

78
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:07,432
Screw 'em. At least
until we get our bearings, Oliver.

79
00:06:07,434 --> 00:06:09,067
Come up with a plan.

80
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:11,436
He's won.

81
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:13,805
There is no plan.

82
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:16,274
Stay here with Thea.

83
00:06:17,743 --> 00:06:19,611
Did you do this?

84
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:21,212
Did you do this?!

85
00:06:24,446 --> 00:06:25,950
You could still
save her, Oliver.

86
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:27,619
I don't understand.

87
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:30,521
Take your rightful place
as heir to the Demon...

88
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:33,091
And Ra's al Ghul
will bring your sister back.

89
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,275
Oliver, what's going on?

90
00:06:47,276 --> 00:06:48,667
Oliver, where are you going?

91
00:06:48,668 --> 00:06:49,836
Away.

92
00:06:49,837 --> 00:06:51,370
You can't just
leave like this.

93
00:06:51,372 --> 00:06:53,005
You have to tell us
what's happening.

94
00:06:53,007 --> 00:06:54,340
There's a way
for me to save her.

95
00:06:54,342 --> 00:06:55,875
Thea?

96
00:06:55,877 --> 00:06:57,625
Come on, Oliver,
that's not possible.

97
00:06:57,626 --> 00:06:59,258
Yes, it is.

98
00:06:59,834 --> 00:07:02,799
There are waters
in Nanda Parbat.

99
00:07:02,872 --> 00:07:06,573
They've permitted Ra's
to live for over a hundred years.

100
00:07:07,665 --> 00:07:09,842
And in rare instances,

101
00:07:09,844 --> 00:07:13,246
told in legend, those waters
have been used to restore

102
00:07:13,248 --> 00:07:16,215
the dead to life.

103
00:07:16,217 --> 00:07:19,051
He offered to use the Lazarus pit
on Thea, didn't he?

104
00:07:19,053 --> 00:07:21,514
Lazarus, as in
from the bible, Lazarus?

105
00:07:21,515 --> 00:07:23,817
The pit's real.
I've seen it.

106
00:07:24,742 --> 00:07:25,864
It can save Thea.

107
00:07:25,888 --> 00:07:27,395
Right.

108
00:07:27,396 --> 00:07:29,062
But only if you become
the new Ra's.

109
00:07:29,063 --> 00:07:32,198
Ok. Well, even
if a magic hot tub

110
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,467
were not crazy talk,

111
00:07:34,469 --> 00:07:37,136
we're not going to let you go and join
the League of psychotic murderers,

112
00:07:37,138 --> 00:07:38,195
even if it is to save Thea.

113
00:07:38,196 --> 00:07:40,097
Which this wouldn't.

114
00:07:40,274 --> 00:07:42,775
The waters change a person.

115
00:07:42,777 --> 00:07:44,809
In the soul.

116
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:47,444
Even if they work,
the Thea you get back

117
00:07:47,446 --> 00:07:49,146
will not be
the one you lost.

118
00:07:49,148 --> 00:07:51,715
The one we lost
because of you.

119
00:07:53,951 --> 00:07:55,919
Oliver...

120
00:07:55,921 --> 00:07:57,420
I'd prefer that we didn't do our usual
"please don't go" dance.

121
00:07:57,422 --> 00:07:59,089
We're not going to.

122
00:07:59,091 --> 00:08:02,392
Because I'm coming with you.
Assuming that this works,

123
00:08:02,394 --> 00:08:05,128
someone's going to need
to bring Thea back home.

124
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:08,231
We need a way to get
to Nanda Parbat.

125
00:08:19,303 --> 00:08:21,805
Sorry to interrupt.

126
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:25,981
Everything all right?

127
00:08:25,982 --> 00:08:28,848
'Cause you got that crease
between your eyebrows

128
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:31,451
that tells me things
most definitely are not.

129
00:08:31,453 --> 00:08:35,121
Something awful
has happened.

130
00:08:35,123 --> 00:08:37,323
And I--
I need a favor.

131
00:08:37,325 --> 00:08:39,692
A really big favor.

132
00:08:39,694 --> 00:08:41,561
Last time you asked me
for a big favor,

133
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:43,162
I had to loan you
my helicopter.

134
00:08:43,164 --> 00:08:45,531
Don't need
your helicopter.

135
00:08:45,533 --> 00:08:48,668
I need your jet.

136
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:51,204
Well, Oliver does,
but both of us.

137
00:08:51,206 --> 00:08:53,873
It's not
what you think.

138
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:55,141
Well, if you're going
to fly away with him,

139
00:08:55,143 --> 00:08:58,444
then...it's exactly
what I think.

140
00:08:58,446 --> 00:08:59,679
Ray...

141
00:08:59,681 --> 00:09:02,682
Last night was a bit
of an eye-opener.

142
00:09:03,851 --> 00:09:08,021
Insofar as
realizing something

143
00:09:08,023 --> 00:09:11,724
I should have realized
a long time ago...

144
00:09:11,726 --> 00:09:15,094
Can be considered
eye-opening.

145
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,630
Last night, when you were
saying good-bye to Roy,

146
00:09:17,632 --> 00:09:20,400
you and Oliver...

147
00:09:24,017 --> 00:09:26,505
You still have
feelings for him.

148
00:09:26,508 --> 00:09:32,312
When I...told you
that I loved you at the hospital,

149
00:09:32,314 --> 00:09:36,049
you responded with Jell-O.

150
00:09:36,051 --> 00:09:39,085
Seeing you two together
last night,

151
00:09:39,087 --> 00:09:41,688
I realized...

152
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:45,491
You don't love me
because you're in love with him.

153
00:09:47,728 --> 00:09:50,096
I'm sorry.

154
00:09:52,366 --> 00:09:54,801
You're the last
person I ever meant to hurt.

155
00:09:59,174 --> 00:10:00,773
Take the jet.

156
00:10:00,775 --> 00:10:03,843
I hope the something awful

157
00:10:03,845 --> 00:10:05,812
stops being awful.

158
00:10:15,235 --> 00:10:16,823
What did Felicity
say to Dr. Vaca?

159
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:19,058
She thinks Thea's
being moved to Central City.

160
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:22,061
You know, they do amazing
things at S.T.A.R. Labs.

161
00:10:22,063 --> 00:10:24,263
We might think about
paying them a visit

162
00:10:24,265 --> 00:10:26,165
before putting Thea
on a long flight to Nanda Parbat.

163
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,134
S.T.A.R. Labs
can't save her.

164
00:10:28,136 --> 00:10:29,635
Only
the Lazarus pit can.

165
00:10:29,637 --> 00:10:31,771
Oliver!

166
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,541
Look, I know
what I have done

167
00:10:35,543 --> 00:10:37,543
doesn't seem like the actions
of a loving father,

168
00:10:37,545 --> 00:10:39,479
but I do love her.

169
00:10:39,481 --> 00:10:41,948
She's the only child
I have left.

170
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:44,274
Having said that,

171
00:10:44,275 --> 00:10:46,409
I would rather
lose her forever

172
00:10:46,411 --> 00:10:48,778
than--than subject
her to the pit.

173
00:10:50,013 --> 00:10:52,315
Get on the plane, Malcolm.

174
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,297
You look chilly.

175
00:11:08,299 --> 00:11:10,433
Yeah.

176
00:11:15,606 --> 00:11:18,007
Thanks for letting me
be here for you.

177
00:11:18,009 --> 00:11:21,010
You're welcome.

178
00:11:22,412 --> 00:11:25,181
I didn't have much of a choice,
though, did I?

179
00:11:25,183 --> 00:11:26,482
No.

180
00:11:26,484 --> 00:11:27,783
I wanted to make you think

181
00:11:27,785 --> 00:11:29,852
you had grown
a little as a person.

182
00:11:32,356 --> 00:11:37,193
I know that I've only
told you a little

183
00:11:37,195 --> 00:11:39,962
about the five years
that I was away.

184
00:11:39,964 --> 00:11:43,165
Well, if by "little,"
you mean hardly anything.

185
00:11:43,167 --> 00:11:46,035
I came back
to Starling City

186
00:11:46,037 --> 00:11:50,339
before they found me
on the island.

187
00:11:50,341 --> 00:11:52,742
I don't understand.

188
00:11:52,744 --> 00:11:55,144
It was complicated.

189
00:11:56,213 --> 00:11:59,048
I saw Thea.

190
00:12:00,017 --> 00:12:01,784
She didn't see me.

191
00:12:01,786 --> 00:12:06,222
She had a drug problem.

192
00:12:06,224 --> 00:12:11,961
So I..confronted
her dealer.

193
00:12:11,963 --> 00:12:14,830
And I broke his neck.

194
00:12:14,832 --> 00:12:17,700
And I did it because
I was angry, sure.

195
00:12:17,702 --> 00:12:22,004
But I also did it because I felt like
I was protecting her.

196
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:31,180
All I've ever wanted to do
was protect her.

197
00:12:32,316 --> 00:12:35,017
Malcolm told me.

198
00:12:35,019 --> 00:12:38,921
He warned me what
Ra's might do.

199
00:12:38,923 --> 00:12:41,290
But I never thought...

200
00:12:45,162 --> 00:12:48,397
I failed.

201
00:13:14,825 --> 00:13:16,926
Incoming!

202
00:13:33,977 --> 00:13:35,444
Maseo, take the wheel.

203
00:14:17,521 --> 00:14:19,922
You look like
you can use a hand.

204
00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:42,611
It's not in here.

205
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,949
What is that?

206
00:14:48,586 --> 00:14:50,719
It's the League.

207
00:15:12,585 --> 00:15:16,521
Welcome home,
Al Sah-him.

208
00:15:40,701 --> 00:15:44,203
I must prepare
for the ritual.

209
00:15:53,146 --> 00:15:56,482
I will treat her
as my own family.

210
00:16:15,035 --> 00:16:18,604
I hope you find
the accommodations acceptable.

211
00:16:18,996 --> 00:16:22,236
Such luxury is a small
glimpse of the life that awaits Oliver.

212
00:16:22,237 --> 00:16:24,137
You trying to reassure me
or yourself?

213
00:16:24,139 --> 00:16:25,472
I don't know
what you mean.

214
00:16:25,474 --> 00:16:26,506
You're Oliver's friend.

215
00:16:26,508 --> 00:16:28,375
Maseo, right?

216
00:16:28,377 --> 00:16:30,277
I am Sarab.

217
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:32,813
Call yourself
whatever you want.

218
00:16:32,815 --> 00:16:34,948
If you gave
a damn about Oliver,

219
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:37,017
you wouldn't be working for the man
who practically killed his sister.

220
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:38,819
Oliver will be
spared grief

221
00:16:38,821 --> 00:16:41,421
in a manner that
was denied to me,

222
00:16:41,423 --> 00:16:43,423
and he'll
receive an honor

223
00:16:43,425 --> 00:16:45,192
greater than
you can imagine.

224
00:16:47,312 --> 00:16:49,663
League of Assassins.

225
00:16:49,665 --> 00:16:53,066
You're feared for your bravery

226
00:16:53,068 --> 00:16:54,835
and power.

227
00:16:54,837 --> 00:16:56,670
Well, all I see are
a bunch of weak men

228
00:16:56,672 --> 00:17:00,540
running from their lives,
trying to escape.

229
00:17:00,542 --> 00:17:03,410
That's not powerful, Maseo.

230
00:17:03,412 --> 00:17:07,814
Or brave. That's cowardly.

231
00:17:07,816 --> 00:17:09,816
Do not presume
to know me

232
00:17:09,818 --> 00:17:12,819
until you've held
your dying child in your arms.

233
00:17:13,813 --> 00:17:17,782
Until you've told him
everything would be ok

234
00:17:17,784 --> 00:17:21,752
so that the last
words he ever hears

235
00:17:21,754 --> 00:17:24,355
are a lie.

236
00:17:25,824 --> 00:17:28,192
You know nothing.

237
00:17:28,194 --> 00:17:31,229
I'm sorry.

238
00:17:31,231 --> 00:17:34,165
What was your child's name?

239
00:17:35,567 --> 00:17:37,502
Akio.

240
00:17:37,504 --> 00:17:41,643
You think Akio would be
proud of his father right now?

241
00:17:42,668 --> 00:17:44,176
_

242
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,712
_

243
00:17:46,713 --> 00:17:50,575
_

244
00:18:57,438 --> 00:18:59,605
Thea!

245
00:18:59,607 --> 00:19:01,874
Thea!

246
00:19:10,451 --> 00:19:13,453
I've fulfilled my end
of our arrangement.

247
00:19:13,455 --> 00:19:16,523
I suggest you begin
to make peace with yours.

248
00:19:23,165 --> 00:19:26,967
Hey. Hey. It's ok.
You're ok.

249
00:19:26,969 --> 00:19:28,602
I don't know you.

250
00:19:31,305 --> 00:19:33,573
Thea, it's--it's me.

251
00:19:33,575 --> 00:19:35,375
It's Ollie.

252
00:19:35,377 --> 00:19:37,911
Ollie's dead.

253
00:19:37,913 --> 00:19:40,480
Dad?

254
00:19:40,482 --> 00:19:43,650
I'm here, Thea.
It--it's me.

255
00:19:45,219 --> 00:19:47,554
What's going on?

256
00:19:47,556 --> 00:19:49,155
Where am I?

257
00:19:49,157 --> 00:19:50,890
Some place safe.

258
00:19:50,892 --> 00:19:53,159
You are safe.

259
00:19:53,161 --> 00:19:54,961
Where's mom?

260
00:19:58,232 --> 00:19:59,833
Your mother's not here.

261
00:19:59,835 --> 00:20:01,368
Look--

262
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:05,505
just lie back, close your eyes
and get some rest, ok?

263
00:20:05,507 --> 00:20:07,474
I love you, Dad.

264
00:20:16,984 --> 00:20:19,853
Ra's told me that
the confusion would pass.

265
00:20:19,855 --> 00:20:21,388
You have no idea
what you've done.

266
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:23,990
What I've done?

267
00:20:23,992 --> 00:20:25,592
She's alive,
Malcolm.

268
00:20:25,594 --> 00:20:27,079
What I did
saved her life.

269
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,810
She thinks Moira's still alive.

270
00:20:28,834 --> 00:20:29,828
She'll be fine.

271
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:31,197
- You don't know that.
- Yes, I do.

272
00:20:31,199 --> 00:20:33,500
Because you,
Diggle and Felicity

273
00:20:33,502 --> 00:20:36,068
are going to take
her home and she will recover.

274
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:37,862
And what is that worth?

275
00:20:38,889 --> 00:20:40,039
Felicity...

276
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,941
No, this is wrong!
It is just wrong!

277
00:20:49,183 --> 00:20:50,915
I need to talk to you.

278
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:54,185
What is happening here is perverse!
What you are doing to Oliver.

279
00:20:54,187 --> 00:20:57,555
What you are making him do;
I am not going to let it happen.

280
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,861
You can leave us.

281
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,603
You have a great
fire within you.

282
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:14,205
I can see now why
Oliver loves you.

283
00:21:14,207 --> 00:21:15,940
If you knew the first thing
about love,

284
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:18,710
you would not be ripping
Oliver away from his family.

285
00:21:18,712 --> 00:21:20,979
I am merely helping him
fulfill his Destiny.

286
00:21:20,981 --> 00:21:23,648
Yeah, I know all about
the "survive my sword" prophecy,

287
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:26,951
and I am here to tell you
that I could really give a crap.

288
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:30,221
Me and John and, God
help me, Malcolm,

289
00:21:30,223 --> 00:21:32,090
are not going to let this
happen, and we have friends,

290
00:21:32,092 --> 00:21:34,759
and we have resources and
we will go to war to get Oliver back.

291
00:21:34,761 --> 00:21:37,829
You know,
many lifetimes ago,

292
00:21:37,831 --> 00:21:40,632
I loved a woman
immeasurably.

293
00:21:40,634 --> 00:21:44,769
And she loved me.

294
00:21:45,912 --> 00:21:50,742
And we had a son
and then a daughter,

295
00:21:50,744 --> 00:21:52,137
and for many years,

296
00:21:52,161 --> 00:21:54,865
I felt I was the most
fortunate man in the world.

297
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:59,150
My life was bliss.

298
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:01,386
And one night,
a man came to my door

299
00:22:01,388 --> 00:22:03,588
and he gave me
a horrible choice--

300
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:07,492
to leave without saying
a word to them,

301
00:22:07,494 --> 00:22:11,296
or to stand and watch them
tortured and then killed.

302
00:22:11,298 --> 00:22:15,166
And I left
without a farewell.

303
00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:18,269
And to spare them pain,

304
00:22:18,271 --> 00:22:22,106
I endured an agony
worse than death.

305
00:22:22,108 --> 00:22:24,309
Sounds like you gave up
too easily.

306
00:22:24,311 --> 00:22:28,646
If there's one immutable
truth about life...

307
00:22:28,648 --> 00:22:31,616
It's often more cruel
than it is fair,

308
00:22:31,618 --> 00:22:33,851
and rarely provides
an opportunity for any of us

309
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:35,520
to find closure.

310
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:40,091
And all
your posturing

311
00:22:40,093 --> 00:22:42,627
and all
your threats of war

312
00:22:42,629 --> 00:22:45,530
will merely delay
the inevitable,

313
00:22:45,532 --> 00:22:46,831
causing you
to forfeit

314
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:50,335
the opportunity
you have.

315
00:22:50,337 --> 00:22:53,137
This was denied me.

316
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:57,642
You need to tell
Oliver good-bye.

317
00:22:58,978 --> 00:23:01,946
Tell him how much
you love him.

318
00:23:01,948 --> 00:23:06,784
Tell him whatever it is your heart
needs to express.

319
00:23:06,786 --> 00:23:10,254
And do it now.

320
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:14,626
Before he is lost
to you forever.

321
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:34,045
Yeah?

322
00:23:34,047 --> 00:23:35,838
Hi.

323
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:36,840
Hey.

324
00:23:36,841 --> 00:23:38,317
You ok?

325
00:23:38,685 --> 00:23:41,452
I'm sorry, that's
a stupid question. You...

326
00:23:41,454 --> 00:23:43,888
You just saw your sister
come back from being mostly dead

327
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:46,491
and you are about to give up
everything you know and love,

328
00:23:46,493 --> 00:23:48,860
so you're probably not.

329
00:23:48,862 --> 00:23:51,062
I remember the first
time that I thought

330
00:23:51,064 --> 00:23:53,498
I'd never
see Thea again.

331
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,034
When my father's
boat went down.

332
00:23:56,036 --> 00:23:58,903
But you did see her again.

333
00:23:58,905 --> 00:24:01,906
And you'll see her again...

334
00:24:03,242 --> 00:24:04,609
Again.

335
00:24:04,611 --> 00:24:06,678
This is different.

336
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,212
I've just been
thinking about

337
00:24:08,214 --> 00:24:10,882
the...person I was.

338
00:24:10,884 --> 00:24:13,017
The brother
that I was.

339
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:17,955
And how he probably
died when that boat went down.

340
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:22,060
All this time, I've been struggling
with who I am...

341
00:24:22,062 --> 00:24:25,096
And you think who you're
supposed to be is...

342
00:24:26,699 --> 00:24:29,934
The next
Ra's al Ghul?

343
00:24:29,936 --> 00:24:32,403
Honestly?

344
00:24:32,405 --> 00:24:35,206
I don't know.

345
00:24:36,842 --> 00:24:38,876
The only thing that
I can know for sure

346
00:24:38,878 --> 00:24:40,378
is that everything
that I've done;

347
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,080
every--everything
that happened,

348
00:24:42,082 --> 00:24:43,915
it lead me right here,

349
00:24:43,917 --> 00:24:46,784
to this moment.

350
00:24:46,786 --> 00:24:50,088
And Felicity,
if that's true,

351
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:53,057
then...I don't know
what it was all for.

352
00:24:53,059 --> 00:24:55,860
I do.

353
00:24:59,064 --> 00:25:03,768
I wish that I could change
your mind about staying here,

354
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:06,704
but I know I can't.

355
00:25:06,706 --> 00:25:11,542
Just like I know how leaving you
here is going to destroy me.

356
00:25:11,544 --> 00:25:14,479
I don't regret
a single moment.

357
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:18,483
And you shouldn't,
either.

358
00:25:18,485 --> 00:25:20,551
You have done so much.

359
00:25:20,553 --> 00:25:24,222
You have saved so
many people's lives.

360
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:27,291
And you have changed so many
for the better.

361
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:31,229
Including mine.

362
00:25:31,231 --> 00:25:33,531
Knowing you has
changed my life.

363
00:25:33,533 --> 00:25:36,734
You...opened up my heart

364
00:25:36,736 --> 00:25:41,272
in a way I didn't even
know was possible.

365
00:25:43,509 --> 00:25:45,743
I love you.

366
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:17,401
We searched the whole truck.
There's nothing in there.

367
00:27:25,344 --> 00:27:26,878
Where is the bio weapon?

368
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:35,152
Don't make me ask again.

369
00:27:38,358 --> 00:27:41,525
Food cart. It's
in the food cart.

370
00:27:41,527 --> 00:27:43,494
Where is the food cart?

371
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:45,963
We should split up
to cover more ground.

372
00:27:47,532 --> 00:27:49,500
What's wrong?

373
00:27:49,502 --> 00:27:51,402
I know you don't
think we should be doing this.

374
00:27:51,404 --> 00:27:53,337
You decided we should
set an example for our son.

375
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:55,539
And for ourselves.

376
00:27:55,541 --> 00:27:56,807
We can't just
let people die.

377
00:27:56,809 --> 00:27:59,543
If we do, we are
just a shell.

378
00:27:59,545 --> 00:28:01,045
Not really alive at all.

379
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,853
So...that happened.

380
00:28:12,504 --> 00:28:13,906
I'm glad it did.

381
00:28:13,907 --> 00:28:15,826
Me, too.

382
00:28:19,398 --> 00:28:21,299
What's this?

383
00:28:21,301 --> 00:28:24,235
If there's
any kind of God,

384
00:28:24,237 --> 00:28:26,537
something...

385
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:28,606
Alcoholic.

386
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,547
There's not much

387
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:38,082
to toast to up here,
is there?

388
00:28:38,084 --> 00:28:40,017
Well...

389
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:42,486
There's us.

390
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,658
Yeah.

391
00:28:48,694 --> 00:28:50,394
I'm sorry.

392
00:28:50,396 --> 00:28:52,129
Hmm?

393
00:28:52,131 --> 00:28:53,965
Look, I know there's no way
of avoiding this,

394
00:28:53,967 --> 00:28:55,666
of--of getting
out of here,

395
00:28:55,668 --> 00:28:58,402
going some place
where Ra's can't find us, but I...

396
00:28:58,404 --> 00:29:00,705
Felicity...

397
00:29:02,442 --> 00:29:05,042
Felicity.

398
00:29:06,107 --> 00:29:08,746
What did you--

399
00:29:08,748 --> 00:29:10,581
I can't lose you.

400
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,785
I won't.

401
00:29:19,837 --> 00:29:22,138
I stole some of that powder that
that creepy priest lady used on Thea.

402
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:24,716
Wasn't sure exactly what I was going
to do with it when I got it, but I...

403
00:29:24,996 --> 00:29:27,637
Yeah, how did you know you were
going to completely lose your mind?

404
00:29:27,915 --> 00:29:29,815
Or commit suicide.

405
00:29:29,818 --> 00:29:32,418
Was your plan to
sneak Ra's prize out

406
00:29:32,419 --> 00:29:36,054
unconscious
without getting us all killed?

407
00:29:36,056 --> 00:29:38,090
I couldn't leave him.

408
00:29:39,158 --> 00:29:41,827
We have to get him
out of here.

409
00:29:41,829 --> 00:29:44,429
Felicity, this place
is like a fortress.

410
00:29:44,432 --> 00:29:47,300
There's no way we're getting
Oliver out of here without Ra's knowing.

411
00:29:47,301 --> 00:29:48,767
We can't. You can.

412
00:29:48,769 --> 00:29:51,570
If we get caught,
he'll kill all of us.

413
00:29:51,572 --> 00:29:52,971
Then we can't get caught.

414
00:29:52,973 --> 00:29:55,474
I have seen
enough movies to know

415
00:29:55,476 --> 00:29:57,609
that the scary fortress
always has a secret exit.

416
00:29:57,612 --> 00:29:59,312
You were Ra's right hand
stooge for years.

417
00:29:59,313 --> 00:30:01,113
If there is anyone that knows
the way out of this hellhole,

418
00:30:01,115 --> 00:30:03,181
it's you, so don't even
try to play games with me.

419
00:30:03,183 --> 00:30:04,983
The catacombs.

420
00:30:04,985 --> 00:30:08,387
It's rough terrain.
It is not going to be easy.

421
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:10,155
How do we get there?

422
00:30:10,157 --> 00:30:11,623
Through the temple.

423
00:30:11,625 --> 00:30:13,659
Go get Thea and meet us
back here in five minutes.

424
00:30:14,723 --> 00:30:16,161
Go!

425
00:30:22,082 --> 00:30:22,967
Which way?

426
00:30:22,968 --> 00:30:24,967
Temple's this way,
come on!

427
00:31:01,584 --> 00:31:03,672
There's not much time. Hurry.

428
00:31:03,674 --> 00:31:05,607
Why are you
helping us?

429
00:31:05,609 --> 00:31:09,044
Because if I don't,
then I am just a shell.

430
00:31:09,046 --> 00:31:11,180
You reminded me of that.

431
00:31:11,182 --> 00:31:14,783
30 meters down.
The path forks.

432
00:31:14,785 --> 00:31:16,348
Take the left passage.

433
00:31:16,372 --> 00:31:18,372
Come on.

434
00:31:20,156 --> 00:31:22,992
These tunnels are centuries old.
Stay close.

435
00:31:24,628 --> 00:31:25,961
Need to stop and rest
for a minute?

436
00:31:25,963 --> 00:31:27,596
No, no, no.

437
00:31:27,598 --> 00:31:29,698
Maseo says stay left.

438
00:31:31,067 --> 00:31:33,702
Thea?

439
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:35,726
No. No. No...

440
00:31:38,108 --> 00:31:40,909
We have to move, now!
Too late.

441
00:31:44,748 --> 00:31:48,317
Believe me, we do not
want to be taken alive.

442
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:51,086
Hold!

443
00:31:51,088 --> 00:31:53,255
I am Al Sah-him.

444
00:31:53,257 --> 00:31:55,858
Wahreeth Al Ghul.

445
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:58,594
Heir to the Demon.
And you will obey.

446
00:31:58,596 --> 00:32:01,597
Put your weapons down.

447
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:04,133
Now!

448
00:32:05,736 --> 00:32:07,771
Tell Ra's I will
return shortly.

449
00:32:14,177 --> 00:32:16,445
Oliver, please!

450
00:32:17,614 --> 00:32:21,750
Thank you for trying.

451
00:32:21,752 --> 00:32:25,754
I love you all
the more for it.

452
00:32:25,756 --> 00:32:27,723
But this only ends one way.

453
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:36,565
This is as far as I go.

454
00:32:36,567 --> 00:32:39,134
Oliver, the jet's less
than a mile away.

455
00:32:39,136 --> 00:32:40,636
Where are we going to fly to?

456
00:32:40,638 --> 00:32:42,571
Ollie,
I don't understand.

457
00:32:47,177 --> 00:32:50,479
Malcolm is going
to take you home.

458
00:32:50,481 --> 00:32:53,115
Aren't you coming with?

459
00:32:53,117 --> 00:32:55,551
Not now.

460
00:32:55,553 --> 00:32:57,486
You go on, I'll catch up.

461
00:32:59,622 --> 00:33:02,524
I love you, Thea.

462
00:33:02,526 --> 00:33:05,160
Don't ever
forget that, ok?

463
00:33:13,373 --> 00:33:14,373
Oliver...

464
00:33:15,972 --> 00:33:19,475
Oliver, I don't know
what to say.

465
00:33:19,477 --> 00:33:21,877
I do.

466
00:33:23,872 --> 00:33:26,215
John, you're the best man
I've ever known.

467
00:33:28,818 --> 00:33:30,419
And whatever happens,

468
00:33:30,421 --> 00:33:33,689
you're my brother.

469
00:33:48,271 --> 00:33:51,406
I am afraid I will never forgive myself
for leaving you here.

470
00:33:51,408 --> 00:33:54,243
You told me once that...

471
00:33:54,245 --> 00:33:56,411
life is precious.

472
00:33:58,281 --> 00:34:02,184
And that you wanted more
from it than I could offer you.

473
00:34:03,479 --> 00:34:06,188
Don't give up on that.

474
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:09,525
The only way that
I'm going to survive this...

475
00:34:09,527 --> 00:34:12,628
is if I know that
you're out there

476
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:16,231
living your life, happy.

477
00:34:21,171 --> 00:34:23,238
We're always saying good-bye
to each other.

478
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,874
You'd think I'd be
good at it by now.

479
00:34:32,115 --> 00:34:35,951
Well, let's not
say good-bye this time.

480
00:35:19,807 --> 00:35:22,876
What's--
what's going on?

481
00:35:22,878 --> 00:35:26,880
Everything's fine,
Thea, you're--you're ok.

482
00:35:26,882 --> 00:35:29,082
If you're here,
then I'm not.

483
00:35:29,084 --> 00:35:30,617
Well, at least

484
00:35:30,619 --> 00:35:32,486
you're feeling a little
more like yourself again.

485
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,894
What do you want?

486
00:35:37,096 --> 00:35:38,021
Where's Ollie?

487
00:35:38,045 --> 00:35:39,566
Thea, do you remember

488
00:35:39,567 --> 00:35:41,634
anything about
the past few days?

489
00:35:42,969 --> 00:35:45,204
I...

490
00:35:45,206 --> 00:35:47,106
I was here.

491
00:35:47,108 --> 00:35:49,508
And--and Ra's, he--

492
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:50,776
he attacked me.

493
00:35:50,778 --> 00:35:51,977
No, Thea.

494
00:35:51,979 --> 00:35:53,312
He nearly killed you.

495
00:35:53,314 --> 00:35:55,314
Where is my brother?

496
00:35:55,316 --> 00:35:58,417
That is--that is what
I'm trying to explain.

497
00:35:58,419 --> 00:36:03,822
To save you, Oliver
had to join the League.

498
00:36:03,824 --> 00:36:06,458
He--he traded
his life for yours.

499
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:09,328
No. No.

500
00:36:10,446 --> 00:36:11,598
I am sorry.

501
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:13,766
I know you hate me,
and you have every right,

502
00:36:13,768 --> 00:36:15,991
but I am going to make up
for that, for everything.

503
00:36:15,992 --> 00:36:17,119
That is not possible!

504
00:36:17,143 --> 00:36:18,805
Yes, it is!

505
00:36:18,806 --> 00:36:22,741
The League isn't after us
anymore; I am free!

506
00:36:22,743 --> 00:36:24,843
I could go anywhere
in there world,

507
00:36:24,845 --> 00:36:27,880
but...this is where
I want to be. Here.

508
00:36:27,882 --> 00:36:30,783
With my daughter.

509
00:36:30,785 --> 00:36:33,319
You took care of me when I was injured.
Now, please, Thea,

510
00:36:33,321 --> 00:36:36,722
please. Let me
take care of you.

511
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:44,463
Sorry to interrupt.

512
00:36:44,465 --> 00:36:46,298
Is everything
all right?

513
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,534
No.

514
00:36:48,536 --> 00:36:50,135
It's not.

515
00:36:52,039 --> 00:36:53,604
Felicity...

516
00:36:53,605 --> 00:36:56,542
Oliver's...

517
00:36:58,178 --> 00:36:59,712
He's gone.

518
00:36:59,714 --> 00:37:01,547
What are you
talking about?

519
00:37:01,549 --> 00:37:03,243
He joined the League.

520
00:37:03,267 --> 00:37:04,017
No.

521
00:37:04,018 --> 00:37:05,884
He's not coming back.

522
00:37:05,886 --> 00:37:07,386
Shh.

523
00:37:15,044 --> 00:37:17,262
Blood has been shed.

524
00:37:17,415 --> 00:37:19,149
League blood.

525
00:37:19,475 --> 00:37:20,755
And that is a transgression

526
00:37:20,756 --> 00:37:22,523
punishable by death.

527
00:37:22,525 --> 00:37:26,227
And yet you allowed
your friends safe passage home.

528
00:37:26,229 --> 00:37:28,062
You tell me why I should not
hunt these people down

529
00:37:28,064 --> 00:37:30,764
and stain my blade
with their blood.

530
00:37:30,766 --> 00:37:32,600
Because I stayed.

531
00:37:32,602 --> 00:37:35,402
I'm honoring
our agreement.

532
00:37:35,404 --> 00:37:38,772
Now no one close
to me will ever be harmed again.

533
00:37:38,774 --> 00:37:40,288
And your allies

534
00:37:40,683 --> 00:37:42,919
would not have been able
to escape through the catacombs

535
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:46,188
without assistance,
so you tell me who aided you,

536
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:47,923
who this traitor is.

537
00:37:47,925 --> 00:37:49,285
I don't know.

538
00:37:49,398 --> 00:37:50,909
Me.

539
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:01,770
I struck down
three of our number.

540
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,209
For my betrayal...

541
00:38:11,314 --> 00:38:13,582
I offer you my life.

542
00:38:20,638 --> 00:38:22,644
You did not betray me
tonight, Sarab.

543
00:38:22,645 --> 00:38:25,946
Maseo Yamashiro did.

544
00:38:25,948 --> 00:38:28,449
For a moment,

545
00:38:28,451 --> 00:38:30,284
your old life took hold.

546
00:38:30,286 --> 00:38:32,219
But by coming here
and kneeling before me,

547
00:38:32,221 --> 00:38:34,088
you have proven your loyalty,

548
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:36,190
and I will not spill
Sarab's blood

549
00:38:36,192 --> 00:38:40,628
for Maseo's actions.
Stand up.

550
00:38:41,582 --> 00:38:44,950
Your service will be vital
in the coming weeks.

551
00:38:44,952 --> 00:38:49,054
Oliver will need you for his
transformation.

552
00:38:51,357 --> 00:38:54,159
And like Sarab...

553
00:38:54,161 --> 00:38:57,929
vestiges of your old
identity still remain.

554
00:38:57,931 --> 00:39:02,134
Oliver Queen must be
extinguished from memory.

555
00:39:17,011 --> 00:39:18,984
Stop!

556
00:39:31,698 --> 00:39:34,166
No!

557
00:39:39,305 --> 00:39:40,806
Give me the vial.

558
00:40:23,216 --> 00:40:25,550
The word "assassin"
has fallen victim

559
00:40:25,552 --> 00:40:28,153
to many abuses of language.

560
00:40:28,155 --> 00:40:31,289
Its real meaning
hidden beneath the sediment

561
00:40:31,291 --> 00:40:34,626
of lies and falsehoods.

562
00:40:34,628 --> 00:40:35,861
In truth,

563
00:40:35,863 --> 00:40:38,864
"assassin" comes
from hashishiyya,

564
00:40:38,866 --> 00:40:42,167
which means, "those who stand
apart from society."

565
00:40:42,169 --> 00:40:46,538
Now, every man
and woman in here

566
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:48,707
have renounced
their past life

567
00:40:48,709 --> 00:40:52,062
and forfeited their identity
in the name of something new.

568
00:40:52,063 --> 00:40:53,762
And it is a cleansing

569
00:40:53,764 --> 00:40:56,565
only achieved by fire.

570
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:05,229
Embrace the pain,

571
00:41:05,231 --> 00:41:09,100
for it is your soul
finally being unburdened.

572
00:41:38,058 --> 00:41:41,427
Oliver Queen is dead.

573
00:41:41,429 --> 00:41:45,665
Eventually to be reborn
as Ra's al Ghul.

574
00:41:45,667 --> 00:41:48,601
But for now,
only the Arrow,

575
00:41:48,603 --> 00:41:51,704
Al Sah-him,
shall remain.

576
00:41:51,706 --> 00:41:55,074
Al Sah-him.

577
00:41:55,076 --> 00:41:58,611
Heir to the Demon.

578
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:10,021
== sync, corrected by <font color=#00FF00>elderman</font> ==
<font color=#00FFFF>@elder_man</font>

579
00:42:25,767 --> 00:42:27,567
Greg!
Move your head.
