(DRUMMING CONTINUES)

3
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:15,723
Prince Khufu, my son,
what have you come to offer?

4
00:00:16,849 --> 00:00:21,438
Father, we bring this tribute to the
protector of all we see and know, Horus.

5
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:22,939
Praise be upon him.

6
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:26,401
It is a fine offering, Khufu,
a feast worthy of a god.

7
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:30,155
And yet, Priestess Chay-Ara
does not seem to agree.

8
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:35,327
Your offering is lovely, my prince.
If not a bit naive.

9
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,661
(SCOFFS)

10
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:38,538
Naive?

11
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:43,793
To think that Horus would
be appeased by trifles.

12
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:48,047
The portents of his dissatisfaction
grow with each passing day.

13
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:50,383
The celestial rocks used to fall
once a generation.

14
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,510
Now they strike
with each phase of the moon.

15
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:56,098
I thought it was your job to keep
Horus in a good mood, Priestess.

16
00:00:56,806 --> 00:01:00,185
Priestess Chay-Ara only speaks
out of concern for all.

17
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:04,189
Otherwise, she would remain
a bit more polite.

18
00:01:04,897 --> 00:01:08,526
We have warned you, time and again,
of the sky rocks and the threat they pose

to the court of Ramesses the Wise.
Dark times are coming, my pharaoh.

20
00:01:13,781 --> 00:01:16,909
Prayers and trifles will not
be enough to stop them.

21
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:24,792
Priestess!
You spoke with quite the tongue in there.

22
00:01:25,918 --> 00:01:27,420
Did I over-act?

23
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,756
No. I love your tongue.

24
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:41,768
You okay?

25
00:01:41,934 --> 00:01:43,978
Yeah. I'm fine. I just have a headache.

26
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:47,899
Are you sure? Usually, that's a sign
of your memories returning.

27
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:53,280
Yeah, I'm sure.
I can't remember anything yet.

29
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:00,703
Feel like I've seen that
in a movie before.

30
00:02:00,953 --> 00:02:02,289
We need a secure location.

31
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:03,498
What's wrong with S.T.A.R. Labs?

32
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:04,957
Well, I mean, absolutely nothing,

33
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,876
if you forget about
the revolving door you guys installed

34
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:08,711
so the bad guys can
come and go as they please.

35
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,880
Remind me again
what happened to your old lair?

36
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:12,048
Or the one before that?

37
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:14,801
Well, lair number one was
compromised by the police.

38
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:17,554
And I will stop helping.

39
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:20,140
Savage only let Barry
and I live because he felt Kendra

40
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:22,309
start to emerge as Hawkgirl
and went after her.

41
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,101
He can sense her and Carter's presence.

42
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,438
We don't need to make it easier
on him by staying in the city limits.

43
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:27,605
Bet you wish you stayed at
your mother's place

44
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:28,815
-now.
-Mmm-mmm.

45
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:33,403
We need to find a way to neutralize
Savage's advantage. Barry, you're late.

46
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:36,614
Sorry. It turns out it's not easy
finding the ass-end of nowhere.

47
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:39,576
Yeah, for real. The roaming charges alone
are going to bankrupt me.

48
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:41,953
We're discussing how to take away
Savage's new-found power.

49
00:02:42,119 --> 00:02:43,413
His magic stick thing.

50
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:44,831
Uh, Staff of Horus.

51
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,583
Well, it's protected by
some kind of energy field.

52
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:48,960
-I couldn't lay a finger on it.
-Maybe wear mittens next time.

53
00:02:49,126 --> 00:02:51,087
What if we made some sort of
insulated gauntlets?

54
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:52,339
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

55
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:53,631
The magnetic shielding
could disrupt the...

56
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:55,633
-Staff's magnetic polarity.
-Yeah.

57
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,969
-Well, while the geek squad works...
-FELICITY: Heard that, honey.

the staff away from Savage,

59
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:02,139
we need to know everything
there is to know about him.

60
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:06,644
Well, I googled "reincarnated nutjobs"
and came up with nothing.

61
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:10,064
Uh, Kendra and I would be the reincarnated
nutjobs. Savage is merely immortal.

62
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,317
-Merely?
-Welcome to the new normal.

63
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,486
Anyone who's been around
for 4,000 years should leave a trail.

64
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:16,488
I'll check with A.R.G.U.S.
See if they have anything on him.

65
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:18,865
Uh, Laurel and I can check
police reports and stuff like that.

66
00:03:19,031 --> 00:03:22,327
Good. We need to find a way to
utilize your new ability.

67
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,579
-My ability?
-It might give us an advantage.

68
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,664
Yeah. Whatever you do,
don't let him train you.

69
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:29,876
I'm sorry, but when it rains, I can still
feel where you shot me with those arrows.

70
00:03:30,042 --> 00:03:31,461
I'll handle her training then.

71
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,505
-Yeah.
-Oliver.

72
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:36,466
I need to run something down.
I'll be back as soon as I can.

73
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:41,346
And what exactly are you running down?

74
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:42,555
Don't worry. It's nothing dangerous.

75
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,015
Well, are you okay?

76
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:47,560
Well, we're up against an immortal madman
armed with a magical staff,

77
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,271
so I do have a few things on my mind.

with everything while we were home.

And now that we're here in Central City,
you've just been not you.

Well, maybe it's too bright
and sunny for me here.

81
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:04,911
There is something going on,
and I'm going to tell you all about it.

what I'm dealing with first.

to give to the dog.

Now is not a good time, Malcolm.

153
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,671
I've arranged a meeting with
Vandal Savage. You, me and the speedster.

154
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,548
What? Wait, why...

155
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:49,093
{\an8}Because negotiation is the only
way out of this situation, Oliver.

156
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,639
{\an8}Savage is going to decimate
Central City to get what he wants.

00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,932
{\an8}If your child were here,
you would understand.

{\an8}<i>Suit up. I've already spoke with
fleet feet. He's on his way.</i>

160
00:08:12,324 --> 00:08:15,537
Thank you for coming.
I know this is more than a little crazy.

161
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:19,040
{\an8}Yeah. Well, your friend with
the creepy ring asked so nicely.

162
00:08:19,206 --> 00:08:21,333
{\an8}Please tell me we're not going to
negotiate with terrorists.

163
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,420
{\an8}Or, you know, 4,000-year-old bad guys.

164
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,297
{\an8}Just think of this more
as a fact-finding mission.

165
00:08:26,463 --> 00:08:28,007
{\an8}Maybe Savage slips up
and gives us something

166
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,509
{\an8}that we can use to our advantage.

167
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:32,178
{\an8}(LAUGHS) Thea said you were being
a little bit more humorous lately.

168
00:08:32,344 --> 00:08:34,764
{\an8}I'm sorry. How do you know
so much about Savage, anyway?

169
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,517
{\an8}I don't know anything about him,
Mr. Allen. No one does.

170
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,310
{\an8}That is why I'm afraid of him.

171
00:08:39,476 --> 00:08:44,190
That's not the only reason to be
afraid of me. I assure you.

172
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:55,284
-Thank you for joining me.
-What do you want?

173
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:58,871
{\an8}What all living things want. Not to die.

174
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,915
{\an8}I thought that wasn't a problem for you.

175
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:04,544
{\an8}Only if I take the life force from
Prince Khufu and Priestess Chay-Ara.

176
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,546
{\an8}Kendra and Carter.

177
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:11,593
{\an8}The three of us are locked in a vicious
circle played out over thousands of years.

178
00:09:12,259 --> 00:09:13,720
{\an8}None of your concern.

179
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,179
We've made it our concern.

180
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:17,765
(GRUNTS)

181
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:27,692
{\an8}Robin of Locksley.
I taught him how to use a bow.

182
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:33,155
He taught me how to not feel pain.
I'm the enemy you can't defeat.

183
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,743
The only way for you
and yours to live through this

184
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,911
is to render unto me what is mine.

185
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:43,415
Turn over Prince Khufu and
Priestess Chay-Ara within 24 hours,

186
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:47,920
or I will lay waste to this city,
killing everyone that you hold dear.

187
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:54,594
And after that, I will travel to
your home and do the same thing there.

188
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:57,013
All right, I'm just curious, did you
rehearse that speech in a mirror

189
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:59,390
this morning or is this all
just off the cuff?

190
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:00,642
(LAUGHS)

191
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:07,940
Why would you risk the lives of
your friends and family for two strangers?

192
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,277
Two hundred and six times
I have killed them.

193
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:15,364
What hubris possesses you that makes you
think that you can prevent me

194
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:16,949
from doing so again?

195
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:20,411
Not hubris. Hope.

196
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:25,166
I came to this meeting out of curiosity.
It is now sated.

197
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:29,420
Bring Khufu and Chay-Ara
to Jurgens Industrial in 24 hours

198
00:10:29,586 --> 00:10:33,800
or I will see you dead and buried
under the bodies of your loved ones.

199
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,098
We're not giving up Kendra and Carter.

200
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:42,599
That's not your decision to make.

201
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:45,728
This is a cycle that has played out
for the last 4,000 years.

202
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,814
Savage may be immortal,
but he isn't a god.

203
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,566
-No. But he's the next best thing. Oliver.
-What?

204
00:10:51,358 --> 00:10:53,110
You better be certain that
your stubbornness

205
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:54,654
does not get my daughter killed.

206
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:58,074
Because if that happens,
I will come for you,

207
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:01,703
and in a way that will make you beg
for the likes of Vandal Savage.

208
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,206
OLIVER: <i>Twenty-four hours.</i>

209
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:06,708
Until what?

210
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:10,461
Until we are supposed to hand you
and Carter over to Savage or...

211
00:11:10,627 --> 00:11:13,172
-Savage lays waste to Central City.
-Yep.

212
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:16,050
We've been through this before.
1887, The Huang He flood,

213
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,761
Savage killed nearly two million people
to get to us. And he did.

214
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,763
We weren't helping you then. We are now.

215
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,598
We have 24 hours to come up
with a workable plan.

216
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:26,518
No, this is insane. My life isn't worth
millions of people's lives.

217
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:29,355
-Kendra... I'll talk to her.
-Yeah.

218
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:30,857
Hey, I got this.

219
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,316
I said I'll talk to her.

220
00:11:33,525 --> 00:11:36,863
Hey, here's an idea. Why don't we just
toss him over to Vandal Savage?

221
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:38,697
(MUTTERING)

222
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,116
-Where were you?
-Hey.

223
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:43,035
You missed the whole save the city
or turn my girlfriend over

224
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,703
to an immortal psychopath briefing.

225
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:48,540
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Um, dude,
I... Last night, I, um, I ghosted.

226
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:50,960
No.

227
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,754
-Yeah. I think I'm gonna...
-Don't say it.

228
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,672
-I think I'm going to time jump...
-I just told you not to say it!

229
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,549
I'm sorry. I don't know what else
I'm supposed to do.

230
00:11:57,716 --> 00:12:00,219
Barry, the first rule of time travel
is you don't talk about time travel!

231
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,388
Because by having this conversation,
we're screwing history.

232
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:04,807
Look, I know that time travel
has consequences.

233
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:05,975
I mean, the last time you vibed...

234
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:10,104
Well, I'm not vibing anything right now.
Okay, um, all right, look, don't panic.

235
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:12,523
A, you don't know that you
time-jumped for a bad reason.

236
00:12:12,689 --> 00:12:15,484
It could have been a good one, right?
B, now that you know you time-jumped,

237
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:20,406
you might not do it, right? So, knowing
the future might change the present,

238
00:12:20,572 --> 00:12:22,491
which might change the future.

239
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:24,743
What?

240
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:26,788
My head hurts.

241
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,415
Chay-Ara! Sorry. Kendra.
You shouldn't run off.

242
00:12:29,581 --> 00:12:32,001
-We don't know if Savage is...
-Do we ever kill ourselves?

243
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,419
Excuse me?

244
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:37,048
In our prior lives. Savage has to kill us
in order to live forever.

245
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:39,425
Do we ever kill ourselves
in order to deny him that?

246
00:12:39,591 --> 00:12:40,592
(SCOFFS)

247
00:12:40,717 --> 00:12:43,429
You know, in our past lives, I'm typically
the one that makes the plans.

248
00:12:43,595 --> 00:12:46,765
And I'm starting to think
this is probably why.

249
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:50,227
Everyone in there is willing
to die to protect us.

250
00:12:50,602 --> 00:12:52,688
You don't think that's
a little bit insane?

251
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:57,944
No. I think it's noble.
I think it's what makes them all heroes.

252
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:01,280
Yeah, well, heroes or not,
I'm not letting anyone die for me.

253
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:02,907
Then don't.

254
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:09,538
Be the person, the woman,
the warrior you were meant to be.

255
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,875

Hit me or, or try to.

Yeah, well, as much as
I'd like to do that,

260
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:24,929
I'm really not in the mood right now.

261
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:28,057
Oh, really? Well, I'll just tell Savage
to come back when you are.

271
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,800
It's the only way of finding
the warrior within.

00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:09,015
Sorry to interrupt the weirdness.

00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:12,518
Um, John, Laurel and Thea are back,
and they've got something.

275
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:14,520
Where are Oliver and Barry?

276
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:16,647
Oliver's back in secret-keeping mode,
apparently.

277
00:14:16,813 --> 00:14:19,525
Barry, I don't know. Caitlin and Cisco
are working on the anti-Staff gauntlets.

278
00:14:19,691 --> 00:14:21,027
What do you guys have?

279
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:25,114
Betamax. Aw. Where'd you get this?
Off of eBay?

280
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,323
Lyla hooked us up.

281
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:27,699
Yeah, well, it's gonna
take a while to play,

282
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,035
since we live in a digital world now.

283
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:33,122
The tape came from a conspiracy theory
group that's interested in Savage.

284
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,874
The Pentagon had a file
on Savage back in '86,

285
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,667
but it's all been heavily redacted.

286
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,044
Got it.

00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:43,840
<i>Is this on? I hope so.

298
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:31,263
{\an8}<i>And I suspect that our precious,
fragile world may one day depend upon us</i>

299
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:32,764
{\an8}<i>doing so.</i>

300
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:35,809
Well, that's the understatement
of the year.

301
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:37,269
Or, you know, the last 4,000 years.

302
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:40,606
You have any idea what he meant
by these objects? This calamity?

303
00:15:40,772 --> 00:15:42,774
No, I don't recall a calamity.

304
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,361
-The staff.
-The Staff of Horus?

305
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,822
Yes. I think the staff belonged
to Savage back in ancient Egypt.

306
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:50,449
You remember?

307
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,493
It's a hunch.

308
00:15:52,659 --> 00:15:54,703
And if Professor Boardman's
guess is right,

309
00:15:54,911 --> 00:15:56,956
that staff is how we kill Savage.

310
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,791
Okay, someone needs to inform
Oliver and Barry.

311
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:05,506
Okay. Here you go.
I gene-sequenced the hair strand

312
00:16:05,672 --> 00:16:07,008
with the blood sample you gave me.

313
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:10,677
Still not sure what it has to do with
Damien Darhk, but the Y chromosomes match.

314
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,556
Are you okay?

315
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,643
Thanks for this. It's a big help.

316
00:16:17,809 --> 00:16:19,020
Yeah. You're wel...

317
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:21,022
-Barry.
-Yeah?

318
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,982
Don't tell anyone about this.

319
00:16:25,692 --> 00:16:27,694
All right.
I'd like to know what's going on here.

320
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:29,155
-Felicity...
-Yes, I tracked you down.

321
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,448
I find people for a living.
Actually, I don't get paid...

322
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:32,616
What was that?

323
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:34,785
What was what?

324
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,328
You just super-speeded
something into your pocket.

325
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,747
Oh. Um, no, nothing.

326
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:43,294
Um, well, actually, it's, um, it's
something Oliver wanted me to track down.

327
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,796
-It's about Damien Darhk, I think.
-I want to see it.

328
00:16:45,962 --> 00:16:46,963
Why?

329
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:48,257
Because you don't want me to see it.

330
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,633
I'm sorry. Oliver specifically

331
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,842
-asked me...
-Show me.

332
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:55,306
Okay. I don't know what the big deal is.
It's just a DNA test.

333
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:00,436
No, it's not.

334
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:03,230
(IMITATING FIGHT SOUNDS)

335
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,489
Honey, why don't you finish that inside?

336
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,158
Mom, Flash hasn't saved the city yet.

337
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:15,701
Now, honey.

338
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:17,203
(SIGHS)

339
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:20,706
Can we talk?

340
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,042
Look, I don't know what you're trying
to accomplish here, Oliver.

341
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,543
I know, Samantha.

342
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,131
I know that William is my son.

343
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,761
-Okay.
-Why didn't you tell me?

344
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:40,184
Okay, just keep your voice down.
Your mother told me not to.

345
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,352
What?

346
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:45,189
She offered me a million dollars
to tell you that I miscarried.

347
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,485
My mother was a complicated person,
but she would never do that.

348
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:55,241
(SIGHS) Wait here.

349
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:04,416
Here.

350
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:09,755
I never cashed it.

351
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:13,509
I didn't need her money to know
I didn't want her anywhere near my child.

352
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:15,010
Or me anywhere near him.

353
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:18,222
So, what? He can be just like his dad?

354
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:21,767
Punching out paparazzi and
getting young girls knocked up?

355
00:18:21,933 --> 00:18:23,644
Samantha, I'm not that person anymore.

356
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:27,564
I know. I know you're running for mayor.
Your mother was killed.

357
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,900
Your friend Tommy.
You're a different person now,

358
00:18:30,066 --> 00:18:33,404
but can you really tell me
that your life is any less crazy?

359
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,864
Can you honestly say
that William isn't better off

360
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:38,284
with your world kept away from his?

361
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:42,621
You know, you're right. I'm being selfish,
but I want an opportunity

362
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,207
to get to know my son.
And I think that a young boy deserves

363
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,459
the opportunity to get to know his father.

364
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:52,339
Look, he's happy. He's well-adjusted.
I don't want to run the risk of him

365
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:54,675
getting sucked into your orbit.
That can't happen.

366
00:18:54,966 --> 00:19:00,139
Which means that he can't know that
you're his father. And nobody else can.

367
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,516
I don't care if that sounds harsh.
I'm his mother,

368
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:06,937
and I will do whatever...Whatever,
I feel I have to do to protect him.

369
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:12,151
Samantha, there is someone in my life now.
Please, don't make me keep this from her.

370
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:16,322
Oliver, you will if you want
a relationship with my son.

371
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:20,409
These are my conditions.
You've already asked the world of me.

372
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,661
I'm just asking for the same in return.

373
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:31,670
Everyone's waiting for you.

374
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:33,964
Sorry, just something
I had to take care of.

375
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,717
So I guess you're off
the secret-keeping wagon.

376
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,261
-That's not it.
-Then what is it?

377
00:19:40,011 --> 00:19:43,349
(SIGHS) I think Damien Darhk has
someone operating in Central City.

378
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:45,684
So I sent Barry to run down a lead.

379
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,894
This kind of lead?

380
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,024
He didn't know what he was giving me.

381
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:56,528
But I've run enough tests on your blood
to recognize your DNA sequence anywhere.

382
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:57,779
You don't know...

383
00:19:58,029 --> 00:19:59,781
You had him run
a paternity test, didn't you?

384
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,288
-Look, Felicity...
-Stop!

385
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,500
I cannot hear another lie!

386
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,837
-It's more complicated than that.
-God, Oliver,

387
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:16,131
you are the only person on this planet

388
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,384
who considers the truth "complicated."

389
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:21,887
Just to be clear,
I don't care that you have a child,

390
00:20:22,053 --> 00:20:24,765
I can't believe that you have a child
that you didn't tell me about.

391
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:26,892
I care that you lied to me just now.

392
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,645
Do you know that my whole world
just exploded?

393
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:35,567
And I think that I'm entitled to a minute
to process that by myself.

394
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:38,737
You somehow managed to go
to C.C.P.D. and track down Barry.

395
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,240
You didn't keep it to yourself.
You kept it from me.

396
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:42,741
When were you planning on telling me?

397
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,201
I don't know.

398
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:54,836
If you loved me, if you trusted me,
telling me this wouldn't be such a burden.

399
00:20:55,045 --> 00:21:00,426
It would be a relief.
But you don't trust me.

400
00:21:02,093 --> 00:21:03,720
You never will.

401
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,515
And how can I be with someone
who doesn't trust me?

402
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,398
Felicity...

403
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,025
Are you guys okay?

404
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:19,653
Oliver? What happened?

405
00:21:20,111 --> 00:21:21,363
Nothing. I'm fine.

406
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:25,867
Are you sure? I mean, you don't seem fine.
You seem out of it.

407
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,619
Is everyone inside?

408
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:29,162
Yeah.

409
00:21:33,124 --> 00:21:35,043
We're coming up on Savage's deadline.

410
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,211
Where's Felicity?

411
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:37,796
-Are the gauntlets working?
-They're gonna have to be.

412
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,298
-We're out of time.
-I think they'll work.

413
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:42,801
That staff's gonna go from
<i>Can't Touch This</i> to <i>Invisible Touch.</i>

414
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,638
Savage doesn't know
Kendra has access to her full abilities,

415
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:49,391
which makes you our ace in the hole.
We're gonna put you up against Savage.

416
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:52,102
You attack with the element of surprise.
I will lay down cover fire.

417
00:21:52,268 --> 00:21:53,395
Barry, you speed in and...

418
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:55,647
-Snatch the staff. I got it.
-DIGGLE: Where do you need us?

419
00:21:58,024 --> 00:21:59,860
This is me, Barry, Kendra and Carter.
We've got it.

420
00:22:00,026 --> 00:22:01,152
-Ollie!
-No. We're not risking any more

421
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,154
lives tonight than we have to.

422
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,451
Suit up.

423
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:20,381
You brought them.
And dressed for the occasion, I see.

424
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:23,675
We're only doing this because
two lives aren't worth two cities.

425
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:28,389
Well, in that case, you are wiser
than I gave you credit for.

426
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:30,265
(CHUCKLES)

427
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:35,479
It's been a lifetime. Still wearing
those ridiculous outfits, I see.

428
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,858
You don't need to be here for this.

429
00:22:40,066 --> 00:22:44,988
The culling has a tendency
to be unsightly.

430
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:48,700
(SCOFFS) Your new friends betrayed you.

431
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,368
Just do what you're going to do.

432
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:55,040
It's wonderful to see you again, my love.

433
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:57,125
I will never be your love.

434
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,335
I know.

435
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:00,712
Hmm.

436
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:04,675
That always makes this easier.

437
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:11,682
Chay-Ara, parting is such sweet sorrow.

438
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:13,600
(GRUNTING)

439
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:25,904

(GRUNTING) I've got it!
The gauntlet's aren't working!

446
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:04,610
(GRUNTS) Let go, Barry!

447
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:06,194
No, I'm not leaving you.

448
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:09,072
You're fast enough to get away. Go!

449
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:10,824
Ollie, no.

450
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,827
Run, Barry, run.

451
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,141
(YELLING)

452
00:24:57,162 --> 00:25:00,456
Thank you for coming.
I know this is more than a little crazy.

453
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:09,675
I came to this meeting out of curiosity.
It is now sated.

454
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:13,554
Bring Khufu and Chay-Ara
to Jurgens Industrial in 24 hours

455
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:17,891
or I will see you dead and buried
under the bodies of your loved ones.

456
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:25,607
Barry, you all right?

457
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:33,615
(PANTING)

458
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:36,577
We need to brief the team.
Come up with some type of counter attack.

459
00:25:37,368 --> 00:25:38,453
It's not gonna work.

460
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:41,748
What?

461
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:44,542
(GRUNTS) Nothing, all right. Never mind.
I shouldn't have said anything. I...

462
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:45,794
Hey, what's going on?

463
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:48,379
Okay, look. This isn't going to make
any sense to you, but I... (SIGHS)

464
00:25:48,546 --> 00:25:51,883
All right, so I traveled back in time
from when we tried to take out Savage.

465
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:55,596
(STUTTERS) I mean, later, when we try
to take him down, in the future,

466
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:57,555
and it doesn't work.

467
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:00,058
You're right.
That doesn't make sense to me.

468
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:01,517
My world is stranger than yours.

469
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:03,687
Well, maybe we use that to our advantage.

470
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:07,315
You say that whatever we do
against Savage doesn't work?

471
00:26:07,608 --> 00:26:09,525
-Yeah.
-Then we come up with a new plan.

472
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:11,402
No. No, no, no.
Okay, look, you can't.

473
00:26:11,612 --> 00:26:14,572
(STUTTERS) When I mess with time,
it just... It doesn't end well.

474
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,283
But what you're telling is
that it already doesn't end well.

475
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:20,912
Barry, people in our line of work,
we don't get second chances.

476
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,247
We need to take this one.

477
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:23,832
All right. I hope you're right.

478
00:26:24,582 --> 00:26:26,251
All right.
Let's start with what went wrong.

479
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:31,422
You did. When we go up against Savage,
your head's not in the game.

480
00:26:31,632 --> 00:26:33,299
-You're not yourself.
-Why not?

481
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:36,261
-Oliver, I...
-Barry, why not?

482
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:40,807
Okay, are you planning on
giving me a hair sample

483
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:42,768
to run forensics on in the near future?

484
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:44,728
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

485
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:48,439
Well, I did. And you were
pretty shaken after the fact.

486
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:51,777
And then Felicity found out.
And you guys had a pretty big fight,

487
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:53,611
and it sounded like it was over
between you two.

488
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,946
What was the fight about?

489
00:26:55,571 --> 00:26:56,572
(SIGHS)

490
00:26:58,574 --> 00:27:01,202
I'm pretty sure you're
someone's father, Oliver.

491
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:05,165
(SIGHS)

492
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:07,876
So when we go up against Savage,
you're not focused.

493
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:10,295
And then Kendra can't access her powers

494
00:27:10,586 --> 00:27:14,257
and then the tech they're developing to
counteract Savage's staff does not work.

495
00:27:14,632 --> 00:27:15,633
(SIGHS)

496
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:17,928
Everyone dies, Oliver.

497
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:23,183
This time, they won't.
This time, we do things differently.

498
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,315
How're they coming?

499
00:27:30,481 --> 00:27:34,610
For my first pair of anti-Gandalf
magic staff gloves, pretty good, I think.

500
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:36,071
Yeah, just double and triple check, okay?

501
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:37,989
I'm a little worried
about them not working.

502
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,365
Based on what?

503
00:27:39,657 --> 00:27:41,076
Call it a gut instinct.

504
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:44,620
Also, I need you to talk to Kendra.

505
00:27:45,496 --> 00:27:47,874
Oh, I get it. You shoot arrows,
you give love tips.

506
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,500
It's like you're Cupid or something.

507
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:51,419
What Carter is doing with her
isn't working.

508
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:53,088
We need her power to fight Savage,

509
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:55,590
and we need her
to be able to use it reliably.

510
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:59,094
Carter's a jerk. But he's supposed to be
with her, 'cause destiny says

511
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,596
they're supposed to be together
and he's supposed to be her soulmate.

512
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:03,056
So I'm not even sure
what I could say...

513
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:05,516
You need to do something, Cisco.
We need to reach her.

514
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:07,643
Egyptian reincarnation is not
in my wheelhouse.

515
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:12,440
What Kendra is going through
is about accepting who she really is.

516
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:16,486
Who better to help her do that than a guy
who is clearly in love with her?

517
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,992
I don't know if we're at
the L-bomb stage yet.

518
00:28:23,534 --> 00:28:24,535
I'll talk to her.

519
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,205
You don't think that's
a little bit insane?

520
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,916
No. I think it's noble.
I think it's what makes them all heroes.

521
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:33,461
Yeah, that's nice. I'm gonna talk
to Kendra for a minute, He-Man.

522
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:34,712
(CHUCKLES)

523
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:37,465
It's Hawkman. Thanks.

524
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:42,804
We should talk.

525
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:45,766
I thought you were the one that said
we should wait till this was all over.

526
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:49,685
Oh, this isn't that talk. This is the
trying-to-help-you-sprout-wings talk.

527
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:52,605
Yeah, well, according to Carter,
I'm a warrior priestess,

528
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:54,900
and rage is the key to
rediscovering myself.

529
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:56,902
Yeah, I'm not surprised
Mr. Aggro thinks that,

530
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,820
but I think he's got
this whole thing twisted.

531
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:02,365
Instead of focusing on the warrior,
focus on the priestess.

532
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:04,159
And the nurturer.

533
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:06,077
The good-hearted person inside.

534
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,997
How do you know I was so
goodhearted 4,000 years ago?

535
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:12,708
Because I know you, Kendra,
and some things don't change.

536
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:15,586
I think you're resisting what
Carter's trying to teach you

537
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:19,049
because it means remembering who you were,
and that is somebody else.

538
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,427
Somebody who loves him.

539
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:28,058
Ever since I emerged,

540
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:31,144
I've been remembering our first life.

541
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:32,437
In Egypt.

542
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:36,607
But I've been telling Carter I can't
remember anything because...

543
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,276
Because I don't want to accept

544
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:41,737
that I'm some reincarnated
Egyptian warrior priestess.

545
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:42,906
(SIGHS)

546
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:46,868
Okay. Yeah, that's pretty heavy.

547
00:29:48,619 --> 00:29:50,371
But it's also pretty amazing.

548
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:53,083
I've been through this. You know I have.

549
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:56,711
And what you're going through
right now, this is a gift.

550
00:29:57,212 --> 00:30:00,340
It's a miracle that most people
don't even get to experience.

551
00:30:00,506 --> 00:30:02,633
Yeah, well, it feels like a nightmare.

552
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:06,387
Yeah, but that, that is a choice.
You can choose the other thing.

553
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:08,807
To remember who you are, or who you were.

554
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:14,312
Close your eyes. Just close your eyes.

555

556
00:30:16,772 --> 00:30:21,527
Let yourself... Let yourself remember.

557
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:31,496
Hey, hey, hey, wait.
Stay a little longer?

558
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:38,628
I can't. Hath-Set and I need to make
another offering to Horus.

559
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:42,673
The augers have said more
sky rocks will be falling soon.

560
00:30:42,883 --> 00:30:44,759
Well, I hear he covets you.

561
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:47,846
How fortunate I know the man
who can handle him.

562
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:53,184
Prince Khufu.
What a surprise to find you here,

563
00:30:54,477 --> 00:30:56,104
in Chay-Ara's bed chamber.

564
00:30:56,562 --> 00:31:01,359
Surely you must know that the clergy
is forbidden to lie with royalty.

565
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:03,236
Get out.

566
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:07,032
The penalty for such
a transgression is death.

567
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:09,868
I said get out.

Soon, the sky rocks will decimate
this kingdom and end his rule.

What? What happened?

I think I know how to beat Vandal Savage.

590
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:57,308
Oliver, you were right. I don't know
how you knew, but you were right.

591
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:59,727
The gauntlets won't work.
They're missing a critical element.

00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:02,438
-How do you know?
-Because I remembered.

593
00:33:02,813 --> 00:33:05,816
I remember how Savage killed us
the first time. Back in Egypt.

594
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:08,528
I've never been able
to remember our first death.

595
00:33:08,694 --> 00:33:10,655
Well, these sky rocks, meteors,

596
00:33:10,821 --> 00:33:13,408
they fell and they completely
destroyed the royal palace.

597
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:15,326
During the Middle Kingdom,
Egypt experienced a high level

598
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:16,494
of meteorite activity.

599
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,371
I know stuff.

Which is one of the many reasons
we love you so much,

but also doesn't seem
to help us stop Savage.

was referencing.

00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:28,464
The meteors, they had a glow about them.

604
00:33:28,714 --> 00:33:31,842
And Savage's staff had two gemstones
with the exact same glow.

605
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,762
Yeah, the gemstones might be made up
of the same element as the meteorite.

606
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:36,806
The Egyptians would use meteorite
in their craftsmanship.

607
00:33:36,972 --> 00:33:38,683
And the minerals glow
in proximity to each other.

608
00:33:38,849 --> 00:33:40,018
Like Sankara Stones.

609
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:43,396
Oh, wait, the <i>Indiana Jones</i> reference is
the only thing I understood.

610
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:45,898
Two pieces of the same meteorite,
like an Nth metal.

611
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:47,525
That is the key
to counteracting the staff.

612
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:50,236
Believe it or not, that isn't actually
the craziest thing I've heard today.

613

the meteorite from the Middle Kingdom

at the Keystone City Museum
of Natural History.

(SIGHS) Hopefully, I got the right one.

616
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:59,079
I could synthesize a compatible
isotope out of this,

617
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:00,246
and coat the gauntlets with it.

618
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:04,375
Okay, do it. Savage doesn't know
that Kendra's gained access

619
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,711
to all of her abilities.

that Savage is pushing daisies?

Does this mean you guys
are the immortal ones now,

we used to help people.

After everything
you guys have done for me,

you don't even really seem to like him.

To remember me by, I guess.

00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,533
I made it out of the Nth metal
that Barry got from the meteorite.

It's got a micro-GPS chip embedded in it.

So if you're ever in trouble,
I'll come find you.

Hey, Oliver, um, we need to have
a difficult conversation, I think.

703
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:46,782
About my son?
God, it feels weird to say that.

704
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:50,786
Well, less about your son
and more about whether or not

705
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:52,497
you're gonna tell Felicity about him.

706
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:53,831
I don't think that's any of your business.

707
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:56,417
You know, yeah, you're right.
It's not really my business.

708
00:38:56,626 --> 00:39:00,087
Except I told you, when I mess with time,
time messes back.

709
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:02,382
And we've already changed
how things turned out with Savage.

710
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:04,091
And I'm worried about temporal backlash.

711
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:07,011
Wait, do you think that the timeline
cares about what I tell my girlfriend?

712
00:39:07,302 --> 00:39:08,346
What are you gonna tell her?

713
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:10,848
Well, you're right when you say
that the rules keep changing

714
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:15,019
and that the lives that we lead,
they make us feel powerless.

715
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:19,231
And it makes me wonder
if William wouldn't be better off

716
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:21,025
with my world kept separate from his.

who didn't get to grow up with his father.

is for you to be a part of his life.

00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:30,868

to just hug you without you knowing,

I can't help you fix it.
I can't be a good teammate.

759
00:42:01,226 --> 00:42:02,562
I love you.

760
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:06,481
And that makes me want to be
the best teammate ever.

761
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:10,152
Not in the Lance Armstrong
performance-enhancing drugs kind of way.

762
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:13,238
More like the more positive
sports analogy I would use

763
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:14,865
if I knew anything about sports.

764
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:20,454
What had you acting so strange
when we got to Central City?

765
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:23,708
It doesn't matter. It's over.

766
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,671
And I am back in Star City. With you.

767
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:31,716
-Mmm.
-Come here.

768
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:34,677
(SIGHS)

769
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:49,567
Your hate will be everlasting.
Your enmity will never die.

770
00:42:50,735 --> 00:42:55,865
It will follow them from this life
into the next and the next.

771
00:42:58,033 --> 00:42:59,660
You owe me one, buddy.
