1
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:27,194
Sir?

2
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:31,574
The telephone recordings you requested.
From La Picota.

3
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,326
Excuse me.

4
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:51,510
<i>He killed the DEA rat.</i>

5
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:53,929
<i>He's beating the shit
out of the North Valley.</i>

6
00:00:54,055 --> 00:00:55,431
<i>What do you want me to say?</i>

7
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:58,392
<i>- Miguel's surprised us, brother.
- Look, Pacho...</i>

8
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:02,688
<i>I'm proud too of how my brother's
handled things while I'm gone,</i>

9
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:04,774
<i>but we all have limitations.</i>

10
00:01:04,899 --> 00:01:09,236
<i>I led our organisation for 20 years,
always taking care of all of you.</i>

11
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:14,784
<i>I know. But the thing is, I don't think
I'm ready to surrender, Gilberto.</i>

12
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:17,703
<i>Besides, I still have to find
the Salazars and resolve the situation.</i>

13
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:19,663
<i>There'll be time for that, Pacho.</i>

14
00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:22,458
<i>It's important to keep
a cool head right now.</i>

15
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,210
<i>Until we finish the negotiations,</i>

16
00:01:24,335 --> 00:01:26,754
<i>it's necessary
that we are all on the same page.</i>

17
00:01:45,106 --> 00:01:46,774
<i>A fucking fridge?</i>

18
00:01:47,525 --> 00:01:50,069
A message from
Miguel Rodríguez Orejuela.

19
00:01:50,194 --> 00:01:52,613
Son of a bitch! What's that smell?

20
00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:56,784
The surveillance team we sent to Cali.

21
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:14,009
CALL ME

22
00:05:55,898 --> 00:05:58,359
General, Miguel Rodríguez
is on the 7th floor.

23
00:05:58,484 --> 00:06:02,696
His son, David,
doubled security after the raid,

24
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:06,658
and there's no way to get inside
that building without attracting attention.

25
00:06:06,784 --> 00:06:09,620
We have to get Miguel to move.

26
00:06:09,745 --> 00:06:12,623
- And we capture him while they're moving.
- Exactly.

27
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:17,169
- How?
- Leave that to me.

28
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:21,298
I'll stay here in Bogotá.
You coordinate the operation in Cali.

29
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:25,386
But it has to be today.
There's no time.

30
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:27,805
Today...

31
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:39,149
Agent Peña, after our last operation,
my superior came to see me.

32
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:43,612
He was very diplomatic, but he made sure
to remind me of all I've achieved.

33
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:47,491
And that it could all be taken away.

34
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:52,871
I worry that the only people who could do
more damage to the country than the cartel

35
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:55,290
are the sons of bitches they've bought.

36
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:59,586
And I don't want to risk bringing Miguel
Rodríguez to jail through the front door

37
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:02,631
so they can let him out the back,
you understand?

38
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,049
General...

39
00:07:05,426 --> 00:07:10,180
You put him in jail
and I'll make sure he stays there.

40
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:16,728
All right. Let's do it.

41
00:07:16,854 --> 00:07:20,274
Let's hope the bastard enjoys
his last day of freedom.

42
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:47,885
All right, gentlemen,
Miguel is here in his apartment.

43
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:50,095
Protected by a small army.

44
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,765
Once I get the signal, I'll organise
a convoy and come down this way.

45
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:55,726
Carrera 15, until we get here.

46
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:59,938
There we will turn and go
down 25th Street until Santa Rita.

47
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:01,982
How many cars?

48
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:05,861
Four SUVs. I'll be in the first
and Miguel will be in the third.

49
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:11,033
I think that gives him
an opportunity to escape.

50
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:14,077
I've got something
far more aggressive in mind.

51
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:16,830
I don't want to give that son of a bitch
the opportunity to end up anywhere

52
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:18,916
other than the back of my truck.

53
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:22,503
You flush him out of the apartment,
and I'll take him down.

54
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:29,176
<i>Sir, please believe me!
I swear it on my family, sir.</i>

55
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:34,264
<i>No! No, sir! Please wait!
I already told you the truth, sir!</i>

56
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:40,479
Play it again. From the beginning.

57
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:42,439
But what for?

58
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:46,777
All you're going to hear is a man yelling
because he's being tortured, nothing more.

59
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:50,072
I told you, maybe he said something
that'll help us nail the motherfucker.

60
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:52,449
But didn't we already catch the mole?

61
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,827
I'm going to tell you something.

62
00:08:55,953 --> 00:08:59,206
I hate that motherfucker Salcedo
with all of my heart.

63
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:01,875
But what's your problem with him?
He may be clean.

64
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,796
The problem I have with him is that
he's a fucking lying son of a bitch.

65
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:07,339
And I know it.

66
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:10,259
Now start it from the fucking beginning.

67
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:12,719
You hear?

68
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:25,667
Put all the clothes you want to take
on the bed.

69
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:29,046
Put any jewellery and valuables
under the clothes.

70
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:36,219
Anyone comes in,
it'll look like you just did the wash.

71
00:10:36,345 --> 00:10:40,223
When it's time, put everything
in the suitcases, OK?

72
00:10:40,349 --> 00:10:42,643
Good. One more thing.

73
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:45,896
Come with me, please.

74
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:53,612
Paola, don't freak out.

75
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:56,948
- Wait, Jorge, wait.
- It's only a precaution, Paola.

76
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:01,536
Wow.

77
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:04,831
My love...
Take it, Paola.

78
00:11:07,918 --> 00:11:10,879
Like this. Hold on tight.

79
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:14,675
Here's the safety.
Now it's ready... and now it's not.

80
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,344
That's the only thing you need to do.

81
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:21,390
If anyone you don't know
comes through that door, use it.

82
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:24,017
- Okay?
- Yes.

83
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:27,896
My love, you can do this.
You can do this.

84
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:36,780
I'll leave it here.

85
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:44,705
I can do this.

86
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,541
It's my only choice.

87
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:50,919
As soon as the DEA gets here,
you go with them. You can't wait for me.

88
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:54,297
- What about you?
- I'll be fine.

89
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:58,635
Don't worry.

90
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:05,934
Don't worry. Everything'll be OK.

91
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:12,733
<i>What I'm about to tell you
is a little delicate.</i>

92
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:14,860
But it concerns all of our futures.

93
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:17,279
I've been concerned
about my brother, Gilberto.

94
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:23,118
The thing is, he's been speaking
to some of our partners without telling me.

95
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:27,706
Undermining me. Making it very difficult
to run this business.

96
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:30,917
So...

97
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:38,008
I decided to have
my brother's phone tapped.

98
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:42,888
What the fuck are you saying, Miguel?

99
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:45,515
We don't tap each other's phones.

100
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,102
I know. But in this case,
it was necessary.

101
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:54,149
I heard you two talking to him
about the surrender.

102
00:12:57,778 --> 00:12:59,863
And you heard something
I wasn't supposed to say or what?

103
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:03,909
What is this shit, Miguel?
Now we can't talk to Gilberto?

104
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:05,994
Of course you can.

105
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,871
You're not going to make
a fucking speech now.

106
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:12,501
No, I'm not going to make a speech,
but I will tell you one important thing.

107
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:18,256
The surrender was Gilberto's dream.
It was never ours.

108
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:23,678
Besides, we all know how good
Gilberto is at promising things

109
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:26,014
when he wants something from us.

110
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,183
What did he promise you?

111
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:34,272
New York.
But did he tell you when? How?

112
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:36,274
You have shit.

113
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,112
Chepe...

114
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:45,826
Here you have a passport,
a new social security number,

115
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:49,746
and the addresses
of two labs in New York

116
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:52,499
so you can rebuild what's ours.

117
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:58,255
And what did he promise you?
The Salazars?

118
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:03,593
Here's the location
where the Salazars are hiding.

119
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:06,805
So you can avenge your brother.

120
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:21,361
Henao gave it to me.

121
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:24,656
So the North Valley war
is over or what?

122
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,201
That's right. In our favour.

123
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:34,541
Of course, first I had to send
that motherfucker a little gift.

124
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:46,469
Look, Miguel...
I think you need to tell us the truth.

125
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:50,015
No fucking lies.

126
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:54,603
What the fuck have you done
with the real Miguel Rodríguez Orejuela?

127
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:01,026
Surrender's for pussies!

128
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:27,177
Listen up... Mr Wiretap.

129
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:31,723
Never ever touch my phone.

130
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:35,310
Understood?

131
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:56,289
Don Miguel.

132
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,543
Sir?

133
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:03,672
- What?
- Excuse me.

134
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:06,257
I just heard DEA agents
are back in Cali.

135
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:12,097
Any update on the accountant?

136
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:16,977
Well, we're still looking, but no luck.

137
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:35,245
Motherfucker.

138
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:40,834
This has to be the place
Enrique told us about.

139
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:50,176
Look there. See if you can find
anything about Salcedo.

140
00:16:56,141 --> 00:16:57,726
Motherfuckers.

141
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:01,187
I know this isn't the ideal situation
for you and your team,

142
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:03,148
but I appreciate your cooperation
with the transition.

143
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:04,274
Of course.

144
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:07,986
I'll put you in touch with the police
investigative team I've assigned.

145
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:09,529
I'll give you the phone number.

146
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:22,667
And they'll stop by
for the files this afternoon.

147
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:24,210
Thank you.

148
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:27,172
One more thing, Minister.
It almost slipped my mind.

149
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:28,840
What's that?

150
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:33,678
I received some information
regarding Miguel Rodríguez's hideout.

151
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:38,850
It seems he's in a building in Cali.
It's called Hacienda Buenos Aires.

152
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:41,853
Well done, Agent. Well done.

153
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:45,231
- I'll get this to my men right away.
- No, that won't be necessary.

154
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:48,526
I've already got my men there
preparing for the raid today.

155
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:50,111
Excuse me?

156
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,721
Jorge?

157
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:20,100
- Don Miguel wants to see you right away.
- Coming.

158
00:18:23,186 --> 00:18:24,479
Sir?

159
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:28,691
Just got off the phone
with our friend in Bogotá.

160
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:31,986
Seems those DEA agents
are here for a reason.

161
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,740
He says they're planning a raid.

162
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,953
We can take you to Santa Rita.

163
00:18:42,664 --> 00:18:45,500
- Do it.
- Of course, sir.

164
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:57,220
We got some news.
Get the cars ready.

165
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:27,167
- Good morning.
- Hello.

166
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,299
You seem happy.

167
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,013
Defence Minister Fernando Botero...

168
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,767
is working with the Cali cartel.

169
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:49,522
- What makes you so sure?
- Played a little "telephone".

170
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:53,693
Something I said to him
that only I know was repeated in Cali.

171
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:58,656
Normally, I'd say you're crazy, but...

172
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:01,367
I'm going to show you something.

173
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,417
- Those Curaçao bank files you gave me.
- Yes.

174
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,878
I had a bank source help me
dig through them.

175
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:13,463
And?

176
00:20:13,588 --> 00:20:17,050
What's interesting is who's listed
alongside Franklin Jurado's name

177
00:20:17,175 --> 00:20:18,843
on this account.

178
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:21,679
Santiago Medina. Who's he?

179
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:24,015
He's an art collector.

180
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:28,228
But rumour is he does some money
laundering for upper-class Colombians.

181
00:20:28,353 --> 00:20:31,231
Cleans their cash through
fancy charities, dummy corporations,

182
00:20:31,356 --> 00:20:33,608
campaign contributions.

183
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:40,198
Guess who Santiago Medina worked with
on the last presidential campaign?

184
00:20:42,784 --> 00:20:44,744
Fernando Botero.

185
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:48,581
There's nothing.

186
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:51,584
Have you thought about the possibility
that Salcedo is telling the truth?

187
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:54,337
Just because you don't like him doesn't
mean everything he says is bullshit.

188
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:56,214
That's got nothing to do with it.

189
00:20:56,339 --> 00:21:00,134
There's plenty of people I don't like
but still trust. Like you.

190
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:10,478
Dario. You see that camera?

191
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,816
Maybe it caught something.

192
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:17,527
Come on.

193
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:23,366
I found this one from last week.

194
00:21:27,662 --> 00:21:29,080
Play it.

195
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:35,795
Fast forward.

196
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,213
Faster.

197
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:43,052
Hit play.

198
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:45,513
And stop... stop it there.

199
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:50,101
See? These motherfuckers
must be the DEA, right?

200
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:53,062
Keep going.

201
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:08,953
His transport's arrived.

202
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:16,044
We're in position.

203
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:19,839
I'll let you know when they come out.

204
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:39,442
Despite how difficult this week has been,

205
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:41,944
we're making it out of the storm.

206
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,988
It would seem so, sir.

207
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:48,034
I've been thinking about the promise
I made to you.

208
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:53,664
Six months until you open
your security business.

209
00:22:57,168 --> 00:22:58,795
That's right, sir.

210
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:04,342
It's even possible
that I'll invest in your business.

211
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:06,094
What do you think about that?

212
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:08,679
It would be an honour
to have your support.

213
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:15,061
- Can I help you with your bag?
- No, it's almost ready.

214
00:23:15,186 --> 00:23:17,980
Take those. I'll see you downstairs.

215
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:19,607
Of course, sir.

216
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:25,238
Keep going.

217
00:23:28,533 --> 00:23:30,118
Stop it there.

218
00:23:35,957 --> 00:23:38,376
No, that's Enrique. Keep going.

219
00:23:42,547 --> 00:23:43,840
Open it.

220
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:48,886
Salcedo is downstairs.
We're waiting for Miguel.

221
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:50,513
<i>Copy that.</i>

222
00:23:53,641 --> 00:23:55,768
Stop. Go back.

223
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:57,478
Go back.

224
00:23:57,603 --> 00:24:00,982
More. There! There!

225
00:24:04,694 --> 00:24:08,114
- Isn't that Enrique again?
- Can you get this shit to stop shaking?

226
00:24:24,547 --> 00:24:25,840
Man...

227
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:30,845
Man, you were right.
You were right, man!

228
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,931
I'm going to kill that motherfucker!

229
00:24:36,601 --> 00:24:38,102
Take this.

230
00:24:40,897 --> 00:24:42,523
Careful with this.

231
00:25:02,752 --> 00:25:04,670
Fuck, he's not answering.

232
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:27,109
Here.

233
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:30,238
Thank you.

234
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:36,160
Dad. It's him.

235
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:38,329
It's that bastard, Salcedo.

236
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:40,831
David, again with this bullshit?
When will you stop?

237
00:25:40,957 --> 00:25:42,041
<i>Listen to me.</i>

238
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:45,211
I found the DEA hideout. The one
Enrique told us Salcedo knew about.

239
00:25:45,336 --> 00:25:49,674
<i>And on the same street, there's a hotel
with a camera pointed towards the street.</i>

240
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:53,636
We checked the video with Dario,
and we saw the DEA, Enrique,

241
00:25:53,761 --> 00:25:56,097
and that motherfucker Salcedo, Dad.

242
00:25:57,974 --> 00:25:59,392
You're sure about that?

243
00:25:59,517 --> 00:26:02,937
One hundred percent.
I checked the plates.

244
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:04,689
Dad, think about it.

245
00:26:04,814 --> 00:26:08,901
He's trying to take you out of a safe place
so they can catch you in the open.

246
00:26:09,026 --> 00:26:10,278
It's a trap, Dad.

247
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:14,448
<i>Dad...</i>

248
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:17,785
I'll call you back.

249
00:26:28,671 --> 00:26:31,299
Jorge, Don Miguel asked me
to tell you

250
00:26:31,424 --> 00:26:34,844
that he needs your help
with something before we leave.

251
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:39,682
Jorge?

252
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:21,807
NO SERVICE

253
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:50,252
- Tell Serrano we're going in.
- Let's go.

254
00:27:50,378 --> 00:27:52,922
General! We have to go in now! Out!

255
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:05,935
You need me, Don Miguel?

256
00:28:07,311 --> 00:28:09,105
Take a seat.

257
00:28:13,776 --> 00:28:16,404
All right, but we should be going.

258
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:22,868
I think we're going to be
a little safer here.

259
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,834
You fucking son of a bitch!

260
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:32,253
What is this?
What's going on, Don Miguel?

261
00:28:35,715 --> 00:28:37,091
Don Miguel!

262
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:39,301
Look how diligent. Very...

263
00:28:41,387 --> 00:28:44,223
Girls, whatever happens,
you don't leave the room, all right?

264
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:46,767
Don't come out for any reason.

265
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,322
- Cover his mouth.
- Don Miguel!

266
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:03,617
Please! Don Miguel!

267
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:16,338
Go to your room.

268
00:29:40,863 --> 00:29:42,698
Let's go through the back.

269
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:58,339
I believed you over my own son.

270
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:02,259
You took my money.

271
00:30:03,177 --> 00:30:05,596
I let you protect my family.

272
00:30:07,598 --> 00:30:12,311
You listened to our private conversations,
you son of a bitch.

273
00:30:20,653 --> 00:30:25,908
I gave you all my trust.
And what did it mean to you? Shit.

274
00:30:26,033 --> 00:30:28,035
Nothing.

275
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,037
You're an animal.

276
00:30:31,497 --> 00:30:34,917
You're a little wharf rat.

277
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:38,587
Not even that.
A rat has more dignity than you!

278
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:40,923
Do you know what I've just done,
motherfucker?

279
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:45,135
I told David to go to your house

280
00:30:45,261 --> 00:30:50,349
and kill your wife and daughters,
you motherfucker!

281
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:54,770
Mrs Salcedo!

282
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:04,613
Ma'am, please open up.

283
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:08,742
Girls, stop folding, please.
Back here. Go back here.

284
00:31:08,868 --> 00:31:10,661
Back! Here.

285
00:31:11,662 --> 00:31:13,956
I want to talk, Mrs Salcedo. Open up.

286
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:39,189
Keep shooting!

287
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:45,029
I know you're in there,
Mrs Salcedo.

288
00:31:52,745 --> 00:31:55,873
Don Miguel!
The DEA is in the building.

289
00:31:55,998 --> 00:31:59,251
- Get María and the boy into a car.
- Sir, you should come as well.

290
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:01,670
Get the fuck out of here!

291
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:39,667
Give me that shit. Get out.
Motherfucker!

292
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,969
Die, you fucking rat!

293
00:33:17,371 --> 00:33:18,372
Go!

294
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:45,065
Don Miguel,
we have to leave right now!

295
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,860
Don Miguel! Don Miguel, no!

296
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,620
- Don Miguel, we have to go!
- Kill him!

297
00:34:52,508 --> 00:34:54,176
Go out the other door.

298
00:34:56,762 --> 00:34:58,180
Hurry up, damn it!

299
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:53,277
Miguel Rodríguez...

300
00:35:54,862 --> 00:35:57,030
you're under arrest.

301
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,507
- General.
- Agent Peña.

302
00:36:15,632 --> 00:36:18,468
I've got Miguel Rodríguez,
handcuffed, at my side.

303
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,518
And Salcedo?

304
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,445
Get in.

305
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:42,951
- Hello, my love. Are you all right?
<i>- Yes, and you? The girls?</i>

306
00:36:43,076 --> 00:36:47,998
Yes. Yes, the girls are all right.
They're scared, but all right.

307
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:49,917
<i>We did it, Paola.</i>

308
00:36:50,042 --> 00:36:52,794
Yes. Yes, we did it.

309
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,088
<i>I'll be with you soon, my love.</i>

310
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:12,022
Got a minute?

311
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:17,069
- We were wrong.
- Wrong?

312
00:37:17,194 --> 00:37:20,822
Yes, I checked
the Samper campaign financials,

313
00:37:20,948 --> 00:37:24,201
and I found that in July last year,
they had serious losses.

314
00:37:24,326 --> 00:37:29,623
They needed money for travel, ads, etc.
And they got $6 million.

315
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:33,377
That just happens to be the amount
Botero took from the cartel.

316
00:37:33,502 --> 00:37:34,753
So...

317
00:37:35,671 --> 00:37:37,798
- ...he wasn't laundering the money.
- No.

318
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,426
That money stayed in the campaign.

319
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:43,553
It was a contribution.

320
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:30,660
<i>We've been talking, Mr Rodríguez.</i>

321
00:39:30,786 --> 00:39:33,121
<i>There's a lot of interest on our part.</i>

322
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:37,793
<i>- If there's interest on your end...
- Yes. Of course.</i>

323
00:39:37,918 --> 00:39:43,340
<i>We'd need to know what we would
be getting for our contribution.</i>

324
00:39:43,465 --> 00:39:45,342
<i>Of course.</i>

325
00:39:45,467 --> 00:39:51,181
<i>As you know, our goal is to reward
our supporters once we take office.</i>

326
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:55,644
<i>The terms we discussed
are certainly reasonable.</i>

327
00:39:55,769 --> 00:39:58,480
<i>Then you have our support.</i>

328
00:39:58,605 --> 00:40:03,276
<i>- How would we organise the payments?
- We should get together and discuss it.</i>

329
00:41:37,913 --> 00:41:39,915
I know it's difficult.

330
00:41:41,917 --> 00:41:43,960
But you get used to being here.

331
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:49,341
You bastard.

332
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:56,598
Look, brother...
let's put the past behind us.

333
00:41:58,225 --> 00:42:01,269
I know this isn't
what you wanted to hear,

334
00:42:01,394 --> 00:42:04,523
but, regardless, we are winning.

335
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:09,152
I don't know what the fuck
we're winning, Gilberto.

336
00:42:09,277 --> 00:42:12,572
By catching you, brother,
they did us a favour.

337
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:15,242
Now Pacho and Chepe
have to turn themselves in.

338
00:42:15,367 --> 00:42:19,246
That's the only way
we'll be able to negotiate the terms.

339
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:25,085
Well, you better be right,
because I'm not staying in this shithole.

340
00:42:36,346 --> 00:42:37,973
I heard about Miguel.

341
00:42:50,277 --> 00:42:51,695
I'm going to surrender.

342
00:42:53,029 --> 00:42:54,698
And Chepe too.

343
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:58,994
But before that,
I have one last thing I have to finish.

344
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:24,936
Gentlemen!

345
00:43:25,854 --> 00:43:29,524
Mr Santacruz, we have to ask you
to come with us.

346
00:43:29,649 --> 00:43:31,568
You're under arrest.

347
00:43:32,402 --> 00:43:36,364
There's room at the bar.
Make yourself comfortable.

348
00:43:39,868 --> 00:43:43,830
Please, Mr Santacruz.
You have to come with us.

349
00:43:45,415 --> 00:43:48,001
Who do you think called the police?

350
00:43:49,461 --> 00:43:51,963
Here's how this is gonna go.

351
00:43:52,088 --> 00:43:56,885
When I'm done,
when I'm fucking ready,

352
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:59,554
then you can give me a ride to jail.

353
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:01,723
Take a seat.

354
00:44:01,848 --> 00:44:03,391
Eat this. Come on.

355
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:06,144
Order whatever you want.
Come on.
