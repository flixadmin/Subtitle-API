1
00:02:04,561 --> 00:02:07,521
Is it possible that the water
has already killed them?

2
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:10,441
- Yes.
- Then what?

3
00:02:12,361 --> 00:02:14,201
If it doesn't work?

4
00:03:43,321 --> 00:03:45,441
Get them in the truck.

5
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:47,881
Get the hoses in.
Start pumping.

6
00:04:03,321 --> 00:04:05,921
I'm here to see my husband,
Vasily Ignatenko.

7
00:04:06,081 --> 00:04:08,641
He's a firefighter from Chernobyl.
I have permission.

8
00:04:08,801 --> 00:04:11,321
Chernobyl?
I'm sorry. No visitors.

9
00:04:13,361 --> 00:04:15,481
Well, but Major Burov
told me.

10
00:04:15,641 --> 00:04:17,081
- He said...
- No exceptions.

11
00:04:17,241 --> 00:04:20,121
Please. I've come all the way
from Kievskaya oblast.

12
00:04:44,521 --> 00:04:46,161
Excuse me.

13
00:04:47,801 --> 00:04:49,801
- Excuse me, excuse me.
- Who are you?

14
00:04:49,961 --> 00:04:51,681
- What are you doing here?
- I have a pass.

15
00:04:51,841 --> 00:04:53,281
You can't be here.
It's not safe.

16
00:04:53,441 --> 00:04:55,801
I am here to see my husband.
Vasily Ignatenko.

17
00:04:55,961 --> 00:04:57,521
He's a firefighter
from Chernobyl.

18
00:04:57,681 --> 00:05:00,041
I know who Ignatenko is.
But you can't.

19
00:05:00,201 --> 00:05:02,201
I have permission.
I... I've...

20
00:05:08,121 --> 00:05:11,121
You can see him for 30 minutes.
Not a minute more.

21
00:05:11,281 --> 00:05:12,881
And you cannot touch him
in any way.

22
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,641
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.

23
00:05:14,801 --> 00:05:16,721
Room 15.

24
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:19,161
Thank you.

25
00:05:19,321 --> 00:05:21,361
- You're not pregnant, are you?
- No.

26
00:05:29,001 --> 00:05:30,481
I won't have to
give that to you.

27
00:05:30,641 --> 00:05:31,921
There they are.

28
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:33,641
Wait, wait.
I haven't finished yet.

29
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:36,521
No, no, he has it.
Yeah, that's good.

30
00:05:43,681 --> 00:05:45,681
Look who the cat dragged in.

31
00:05:47,361 --> 00:05:49,161
What did I tell you?

32
00:05:50,161 --> 00:05:52,721
There's no hiding from you,
is there?

33
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:55,761
Just easy.

34
00:05:55,921 --> 00:05:58,121
Easy. It's OK. OK.

35
00:05:58,841 --> 00:06:00,321
Yeah. OK.

36
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:11,081
How? How... How did this happen?
Who gave them the idea?

37
00:07:11,241 --> 00:07:13,081
- Are you suggesting I did?
- Someone did.

38
00:07:13,241 --> 00:07:16,281
Someone decided
that the evacuation zone

39
00:07:16,441 --> 00:07:19,561
should be 30 kilometres,
when we know, here...

40
00:07:19,721 --> 00:07:22,401
Caesium-137
in the Gomel District,

41
00:07:22,561 --> 00:07:24,161
that's 200 kilometres
away!

42
00:07:24,321 --> 00:07:25,881
- It was decided.
- Based on what?

43
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:29,121
- I don't know!
- Forgive me.

44
00:07:29,281 --> 00:07:31,921
Maybe I... I've just spent
too much time in my lab.

45
00:07:32,081 --> 00:07:33,881
Or maybe I'm just stupid.

46
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:36,441
Is this really
the way it all works?

47
00:07:37,281 --> 00:07:39,001
An uninformed,
arbitrary decision

48
00:07:39,161 --> 00:07:41,241
that will cost
who knows how many lives,

49
00:07:41,401 --> 00:07:44,881
made by some apparatchik,
some career Party man?

50
00:07:47,201 --> 00:07:49,201
I'm a career Party man.

51
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:52,761
You should watch your tone,
Comrade Legasov.

52
00:07:53,921 --> 00:07:56,721
Comrades,
we have visual confirmation

53
00:07:56,881 --> 00:07:58,801
that the fire
is nearly extinguished.

54
00:07:58,961 --> 00:08:00,921
There's also been
a reduction in Iodine-131

55
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:04,001
- and Caesium-137 emissions.
- Good. Yes?

56
00:08:04,681 --> 00:08:06,721
But the temperature is rising.

57
00:08:07,401 --> 00:08:09,401
And...

58
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:17,921
There's a spike in Zirconium-95.

59
00:08:19,681 --> 00:08:22,761
That's from the cladding
on the fuel rods.

60
00:08:22,921 --> 00:08:24,521
Meaning what?

61
00:08:25,401 --> 00:08:27,641
The meltdown has begun.

62
00:09:04,561 --> 00:09:06,121
Get off me!

63
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:10,201
Get off me!

64
00:09:17,961 --> 00:09:19,401
- Stop moving.
- Get off me!

65
00:09:19,561 --> 00:09:21,121
Get off him!
You're hurting him!

66
00:09:21,281 --> 00:09:23,681
You can't be in here.

67
00:09:23,841 --> 00:09:25,881
- What's happening to him?
- Get out!

68
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:28,241
- Please!
- You can't be in here.

69
00:10:10,201 --> 00:10:11,641
Yes?

70
00:10:11,801 --> 00:10:13,521
Put him through.

71
00:10:14,801 --> 00:10:17,601
- Well?
- The fire's nearly out.

72
00:10:17,761 --> 00:10:19,161
Bubbler tanks are being drained.

73
00:10:19,321 --> 00:10:22,401
We have successfully eliminated
the risk of a thermal explosion.

74
00:10:25,241 --> 00:10:26,401
And?

75
00:10:27,881 --> 00:10:29,601
The situation inside the core

76
00:10:29,761 --> 00:10:32,201
is deteriorating
faster than anticipated.

77
00:10:32,361 --> 00:10:35,081
The concrete pad will last
for six to eight weeks

78
00:10:35,241 --> 00:10:38,081
but, after that, Legasov
estimates a 50% chance

79
00:10:38,241 --> 00:10:39,881
that the fuel
will breach the pad

80
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:42,801
and melt down
into the groundwater itself.

81
00:10:43,321 --> 00:10:45,761
Wh... And where does
this groundwater go?

82
00:10:45,921 --> 00:10:49,921
The Pripyat River,
which feeds into the Dnieper...

83
00:10:50,881 --> 00:10:54,121
the primary water supply for
approximately 50 million people.

84
00:10:54,281 --> 00:10:58,001
Not to mention crops
and livestock would be unusable.

85
00:10:58,161 --> 00:11:00,881
We're recommending we install
a heat exchanger under the pad

86
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:03,721
to lower the core temperature
and halt the meltdown.

87
00:11:03,881 --> 00:11:06,321
And in order to do that,
I'm told that we will need...

88
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:12,361
all of the liquid nitrogen
in the Soviet Union.

89
00:11:17,441 --> 00:11:19,601
- All right.
- Of course, we'll also need...

90
00:11:19,761 --> 00:11:22,041
Whatever you need, you have it.
That should be clear.

91
00:11:22,201 --> 00:11:23,361
- Yes.
- Anything else?

92
00:11:23,521 --> 00:11:24,641
- No. Thank you.
- Yes.

93
00:11:24,801 --> 00:11:27,001
I'd like to address
the 30km exclusion zone.

94
00:11:27,161 --> 00:11:29,521
Wait... Who?
Professor Legasov, is that you?

95
00:11:29,681 --> 00:11:31,041
What exclusion zone?

96
00:11:31,201 --> 00:11:33,361
Minor details,
General Secretary.

97
00:11:33,521 --> 00:11:35,641
Premier Ryzhkov
has determined...

98
00:11:35,801 --> 00:11:37,641
If he determined,
then he determined.

99
00:11:37,801 --> 00:11:39,321
Look, Professor Legasov,

100
00:11:39,481 --> 00:11:41,361
you are there
for one reason only.

101
00:11:41,521 --> 00:11:43,401
Do you understand?
To make this stop.

102
00:11:43,561 --> 00:11:46,601
I don't want questions. I want
to know when this will be over.

103
00:11:46,761 --> 00:11:49,001
If you mean when will
Chernobyl be completely safe,

104
00:11:49,161 --> 00:11:51,801
the half-life of Plutonium-239
is 24,000 years.

105
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:55,441
So, perhaps we should just say,
not within our lifetimes.

106
00:12:06,721 --> 00:12:08,481
I think you and I
should take a walk.

107
00:12:08,641 --> 00:12:10,721
It's late. I'm tired.

108
00:12:11,601 --> 00:12:13,881
We're taking a walk.

109
00:12:20,161 --> 00:12:22,161
What is it you want?
An apology?

110
00:12:24,121 --> 00:12:25,841
Not gonna sit back and...

111
00:12:27,801 --> 00:12:29,761
What will happen to our boys?

112
00:12:30,561 --> 00:12:32,601
Which boys? The divers?

113
00:12:32,761 --> 00:12:36,121
The divers, the firefighters,
the men in the control room.

114
00:12:36,281 --> 00:12:39,161
What does the radiation
do to them precisely?

115
00:12:41,201 --> 00:12:43,681
Well, at the level
some of them were exposed,

116
00:12:43,841 --> 00:12:46,881
ionising radiation tears
the cellular structure apart.

117
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:50,681
The skin blisters,
turns red then black.

118
00:12:52,081 --> 00:12:54,241
This is followed by
a latency period.

119
00:12:55,721 --> 00:12:57,241
The immediate effects subside.

120
00:12:57,401 --> 00:13:00,201
The patient
appears to be recovering.

121
00:13:00,361 --> 00:13:02,521
Healthy, even, but they aren't.

122
00:13:04,401 --> 00:13:07,161
This usually only lasts
for a day or two.

123
00:13:09,921 --> 00:13:11,121
Continue.

124
00:13:12,361 --> 00:13:15,881
Then the cellular damage
begins to manifest.

125
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:17,801
The bone marrow dies.

126
00:13:19,081 --> 00:13:21,201
The immune system fails.

127
00:13:21,361 --> 00:13:24,081
The organs and soft tissue
begin to decompose.

128
00:13:24,921 --> 00:13:28,161
The arteries and veins
spill open like sieves...

129
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:31,361
to the point where you can't
even administer morphine

130
00:13:31,521 --> 00:13:35,001
for the pain,
which is unimaginable.

131
00:13:35,161 --> 00:13:38,481
Within three days
to three weeks, you're dead.

132
00:13:40,481 --> 00:13:42,961
That is what will happen
to those boys.

133
00:13:45,201 --> 00:13:46,841
And what about us?

134
00:13:49,601 --> 00:13:51,481
Well, we've...

135
00:13:51,641 --> 00:13:54,561
We've gotten a steady dose,
but not as much of it.

136
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:57,481
Not strong enough
to kill the cells,

137
00:13:57,641 --> 00:14:00,481
but consistent enough
to damage our DNA.

138
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,561
So, in time... cancer.

139
00:14:04,721 --> 00:14:06,521
Or aplastic anaemia.

140
00:14:06,681 --> 00:14:08,601
Either way, fatal.

141
00:14:10,961 --> 00:14:12,481
Well...

142
00:14:14,001 --> 00:14:17,161
In a sense, it would seem
we've gotten off easy, then...

143
00:14:18,561 --> 00:14:20,041
Valery.

144
00:14:31,641 --> 00:14:33,641
I've seen them before.

145
00:14:39,081 --> 00:14:41,481
Now you know why
I wanted to take a walk.

146
00:14:42,361 --> 00:14:44,561
You can presume
the work site is bugged.

147
00:14:45,601 --> 00:14:48,681
And our rooms.
Even our bathrooms.

148
00:14:49,401 --> 00:14:51,441
They've been here
the whole time?

149
00:14:51,601 --> 00:14:53,721
Of course they've been here
the whole time.

150
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:57,441
But if we're seeing them
out in the open now...

151
00:14:58,321 --> 00:15:00,641
it's because
they want us to know.

152
00:15:41,161 --> 00:15:43,201
You've seen that?

153
00:15:44,521 --> 00:15:46,481
The fuel is melting
faster than we expected.

154
00:15:46,641 --> 00:15:48,801
I know. I have a plan.

155
00:15:49,681 --> 00:15:52,801
- Heat exchanger, I hope.
- Yes.

156
00:15:56,161 --> 00:15:58,481
There's something
I've wanted to ask you, comrade,

157
00:15:58,641 --> 00:16:02,441
but I see you're already asking
yourself the same question.

158
00:16:05,561 --> 00:16:07,281
Why did it explode?

159
00:16:09,361 --> 00:16:11,521
I've worked the numbers
over and over,

160
00:16:11,681 --> 00:16:15,201
presuming the worst possible
conditions in an RBMK reactor.

161
00:16:17,081 --> 00:16:19,321
And I always get
the same answer.

162
00:16:19,481 --> 00:16:21,281
Which is?

163
00:16:22,161 --> 00:16:25,441
- It's not possible.
- And yet...

164
00:16:28,561 --> 00:16:30,841
You're not gonna
solve this here.

165
00:16:32,481 --> 00:16:34,481
Not on paper.

166
00:16:35,521 --> 00:16:37,521
Everyone who was
in the control room.

167
00:16:37,681 --> 00:16:39,641
Dyatlov, Akimov, Toptunov...

168
00:16:39,801 --> 00:16:41,361
they're all in Moscow.

169
00:16:41,521 --> 00:16:43,161
Hospital number six.

170
00:16:43,761 --> 00:16:46,761
We need to find out exactly
what happened that night.

171
00:16:46,921 --> 00:16:50,201
Moment by moment,
decision by decision.

172
00:16:51,361 --> 00:16:54,521
Go now, while they're
still alive. Talk to them.

173
00:16:55,841 --> 00:16:58,441
Because if we don't find out
how this happened,

174
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:00,201
it will happen again.

175
00:17:03,361 --> 00:17:05,361
And, Khomyuk...

176
00:17:06,601 --> 00:17:08,281
be careful.

177
00:17:31,721 --> 00:17:33,481
Well, fuck you.

178
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:37,801
Here's one. Here's one.

179
00:17:37,961 --> 00:17:41,681
What's as big as a house, burns
20 litres of fuel every hour...

180
00:17:42,601 --> 00:17:44,681
puts out a shitload
of smoke and noise...

181
00:17:45,801 --> 00:17:48,321
and cuts an apple
into three pieces?

182
00:17:50,401 --> 00:17:53,601
A Soviet machine made to cut
apples into four pieces!

183
00:18:31,481 --> 00:18:34,561
- Who's in charge here?
- I'm the crew chief.

184
00:18:35,321 --> 00:18:38,241
I'm Shadov,
Minister of Coal Industries.

185
00:18:38,401 --> 00:18:39,881
We know who you are.

186
00:18:41,881 --> 00:18:43,561
How many men do you have?

187
00:18:44,161 --> 00:18:47,641
On this shift, 45 here.
100 in total.

188
00:18:47,801 --> 00:18:50,201
I need all the 100 men
to gather their equipment

189
00:18:50,361 --> 00:18:51,761
and get on the trucks.

190
00:18:52,561 --> 00:18:55,041
Do you? To where?

191
00:18:56,561 --> 00:18:58,201
That's classified.

192
00:19:03,921 --> 00:19:06,881
Come on then.
Start shooting.

193
00:19:07,441 --> 00:19:09,641
You haven't got enough bullets
for all of us.

194
00:19:09,801 --> 00:19:11,161
Kill as many as you can.

195
00:19:11,321 --> 00:19:14,081
Whoever's left, we'll beat the
living piss out of each of you.

196
00:19:14,241 --> 00:19:17,041
- You can't talk like that!
- Shut the fuck up!

197
00:19:17,201 --> 00:19:19,721
This is Tula.
This is our mine.

198
00:19:20,761 --> 00:19:22,761
We don't leave
unless we know why.

199
00:19:29,481 --> 00:19:31,401
You're going to Chernobyl.

200
00:19:33,441 --> 00:19:35,561
Do you know
what's happened there?

201
00:19:35,721 --> 00:19:38,121
We dig up coal, not bodies.

202
00:19:38,961 --> 00:19:41,161
The reactor fuel
is going to sink into the ground

203
00:19:41,321 --> 00:19:45,121
and poison the water from Kiev
to the Black Sea, all of it.

204
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:48,121
Forever, they say.

205
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:52,561
They want you
to stop that from happening.

206
00:19:53,921 --> 00:19:55,921
How are we supposed to do that?

207
00:19:56,721 --> 00:19:59,841
They didn't tell me,
because I don't need to know.

208
00:20:01,121 --> 00:20:03,481
Do you need to know,
or have you heard enough?

209
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:44,961
Now you look like
the Minister of Coal.

210
00:21:04,441 --> 00:21:07,201
Vasily?

211
00:21:09,281 --> 00:21:10,641
Vasily?

212
00:21:15,881 --> 00:21:19,801
No, no, no.
They told you, no touching.

213
00:21:20,641 --> 00:21:22,241
It's not safe.

214
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:25,081
They touch you.

215
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:28,121
If it's safe for them,
it's safe for me.

216
00:21:30,441 --> 00:21:32,001
You...

217
00:21:37,641 --> 00:21:39,321
Where are the others?

218
00:21:39,481 --> 00:21:41,361
They took them
to a special room.

219
00:21:42,841 --> 00:21:44,841
They won't tell me where.

220
00:21:48,681 --> 00:21:50,361
Can you open the curtains?

221
00:21:51,081 --> 00:21:53,441
Open the curtains.

222
00:22:15,161 --> 00:22:17,321
Please tell me
what you see outside.

223
00:22:18,241 --> 00:22:20,241
Tell me everything.

224
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,681
I can see the Red Square.

225
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:37,681
And the Kremlin.

226
00:22:39,401 --> 00:22:42,081
Spasskaya Tower, Mausoleum.

227
00:22:44,881 --> 00:22:47,361
Do you see St. Basil's?

228
00:22:48,161 --> 00:22:50,641
Yeah.

229
00:22:50,801 --> 00:22:52,921
Yes. It's beautiful.

230
00:22:54,641 --> 00:22:56,561
I told you.

231
00:22:56,721 --> 00:22:59,601
I told you I'd show you Moscow,
didn't I?

232
00:22:59,761 --> 00:23:02,561
Yeah. Yes.

233
00:23:08,161 --> 00:23:09,881
Thank you.

234
00:23:55,241 --> 00:23:57,641
I'm not eating that,
it's shit.

235
00:23:58,641 --> 00:24:00,761
Give me something else.

236
00:24:00,921 --> 00:24:03,481
I'm not a nurse,
Comrade Dyatlov.

237
00:24:03,641 --> 00:24:05,281
I'm a nuclear physicist.

238
00:24:06,241 --> 00:24:08,561
Well, then,
Comrade Nuclear Physicist...

239
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:11,041
unless you happen to have

240
00:24:11,201 --> 00:24:13,601
a butter and caviar sandwich
on you...

241
00:24:14,361 --> 00:24:16,961
you can get the fuck
out of my room.

242
00:25:31,921 --> 00:25:33,081
What?

243
00:25:34,481 --> 00:25:36,441
I'm not good at this, Boris.

244
00:25:36,601 --> 00:25:38,401
The lying.

245
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,721
Have you ever spent time
with miners?

246
00:25:47,401 --> 00:25:48,561
No.

247
00:25:48,721 --> 00:25:50,521
My advice, tell the truth.

248
00:25:51,441 --> 00:25:54,161
These men work in the dark.
They see everything.

249
00:25:56,161 --> 00:25:58,161
Andrei Glukhov, crew chief.

250
00:26:13,041 --> 00:26:14,361
Do these work?

251
00:26:15,961 --> 00:26:17,561
To an extent.

252
00:26:20,241 --> 00:26:22,081
Of course.

253
00:26:33,361 --> 00:26:35,481
So, what's the job?

254
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:40,121
We need to install
a liquid nitrogen heat exchanger

255
00:26:40,281 --> 00:26:43,281
underneath this concrete pad.

256
00:26:43,441 --> 00:26:44,881
There's no way to approach

257
00:26:45,041 --> 00:26:46,881
from the interior
of the building,

258
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:49,201
so you have to get at it
from underground.

259
00:26:49,361 --> 00:26:50,441
And what's above the pad?

260
00:26:50,601 --> 00:26:52,761
The core of the nuclear reactor,

261
00:26:52,921 --> 00:26:55,081
which is melting down.

262
00:26:56,561 --> 00:26:58,121
What, like...?

263
00:26:59,561 --> 00:27:00,841
Essentially.

264
00:27:02,521 --> 00:27:03,921
Is it gonna fall on top of us?

265
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:05,841
Not if you're done
within six weeks.

266
00:27:07,721 --> 00:27:09,561
Dimensions?

267
00:27:12,521 --> 00:27:14,321
Break ground here...

268
00:27:14,481 --> 00:27:16,601
dig a tunnel 150 metres to here,

269
00:27:16,761 --> 00:27:20,921
excavate a space 30 by 30 metres
for the heat exchanger.

270
00:27:21,081 --> 00:27:22,441
Because we need to keep

271
00:27:22,601 --> 00:27:24,561
disruption of the ground above
to a minimum,

272
00:27:24,721 --> 00:27:26,281
you can't use
any heavy machinery.

273
00:27:26,441 --> 00:27:29,681
- It has to be done by hand.
- I'm gonna need more men.

274
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:34,241
400, at least. We'll have
to work round the clock.

275
00:27:35,041 --> 00:27:37,001
How deep do you want this
tunnel? Six metres?

276
00:27:37,161 --> 00:27:40,001
- 12.
- 12? Why?

277
00:27:40,681 --> 00:27:42,481
For your protection.

278
00:27:42,641 --> 00:27:44,401
At that depth,
you'll be shielded

279
00:27:44,561 --> 00:27:46,401
from much of
the radiation.

280
00:27:47,201 --> 00:27:50,561
The entrance to the tunnel
won't be 12 metres below ground.

281
00:27:51,601 --> 00:27:53,281
No.

282
00:27:53,441 --> 00:27:56,241
And we're not
12 metres below ground now.

283
00:27:59,441 --> 00:28:02,641
No. We're not.

284
00:28:06,281 --> 00:28:09,001
We have some
equipment here on site.

285
00:28:09,161 --> 00:28:11,201
More will arrive by midnight.

286
00:28:12,721 --> 00:28:15,801
- You can start in the morning.
- No. We start now.

287
00:28:15,961 --> 00:28:17,441
I don't want my men here

288
00:28:17,601 --> 00:28:20,041
one more second
than they need to be.

289
00:28:21,441 --> 00:28:24,441
If these worked...
you'd be wearing them.

290
00:28:34,641 --> 00:28:37,961
- Are they all like that?
- They're all like that.

291
00:29:58,961 --> 00:30:01,001
- Yes?
- What's it up to?

292
00:30:01,161 --> 00:30:03,161
It's 50 degrees.

293
00:30:06,641 --> 00:30:08,201
Fuck.

294
00:30:12,121 --> 00:30:13,881
Hey!

295
00:30:14,041 --> 00:30:15,841
Hey, you.

296
00:30:24,441 --> 00:30:27,321
- We need fans.
- For what purpose?

297
00:30:27,481 --> 00:30:29,201
What do you mean,
for what purpose?

298
00:30:29,361 --> 00:30:31,081
To dig your fucking tunnel,
that's why!

299
00:30:31,241 --> 00:30:33,641
- Who's talking to you?
- Whoa, whoa. Comrades...

300
00:30:33,801 --> 00:30:36,041
It's 50 degrees in there.

301
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:39,321
We can't breathe without masks,
we can't breathe with the masks.

302
00:30:39,481 --> 00:30:42,001
It's like a fucking oven.
We need ventilation.

303
00:30:42,161 --> 00:30:45,081
Fans will put dust in the air,
the dust will go in your lungs.

304
00:30:45,241 --> 00:30:47,641
I've been breathing dust
in my lungs for 20 years.

305
00:30:47,801 --> 00:30:50,361
Not this dust. I'm sorry.

306
00:30:50,521 --> 00:30:52,681
For your own good, no fans.

307
00:31:20,321 --> 00:31:22,441
My name is Ulana Khomyuk.

308
00:31:22,601 --> 00:31:25,801
I'm a nuclear physicist
with the Chernobyl Commission.

309
00:31:27,681 --> 00:31:29,721
I want you to tell me
everything that happened

310
00:31:29,881 --> 00:31:31,521
on the night of the accident.

311
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:34,321
Is that all right?

312
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:38,241
Yes.

313
00:31:40,161 --> 00:31:41,681
I want to tell.

314
00:31:42,761 --> 00:31:44,241
All right.

315
00:31:56,361 --> 00:31:58,401
Your official title was...?

316
00:32:01,561 --> 00:32:06,241
My name is
Leonid Fedorovych Toptunov.

317
00:32:07,161 --> 00:32:11,881
I am the Senior Reactor
Control Chief Engineer

318
00:32:12,041 --> 00:32:14,801
at Chernobyl
Nuclear Power Plant.

319
00:32:18,161 --> 00:32:20,161
Senior engineer?

320
00:32:22,241 --> 00:32:24,361
How old are you?

321
00:32:28,721 --> 00:32:30,721
I'm 25.

322
00:33:16,441 --> 00:33:18,001
Lyusya. Lyusya.

323
00:33:18,161 --> 00:33:20,761
Yes, I'm here. I'm here. I'm...

324
00:33:34,921 --> 00:33:36,721
Have you been here
this whole time?

325
00:33:36,881 --> 00:33:38,481
No-one said I should leave.

326
00:33:39,281 --> 00:33:40,601
I did.

327
00:33:40,761 --> 00:33:42,081
30 minutes, I said.

328
00:33:42,241 --> 00:33:45,001
Where have you been...
when he's in pain?

329
00:33:45,161 --> 00:33:46,561
When the sores
stick to his gown,

330
00:33:46,721 --> 00:33:48,481
when he soils himself
five times a night,

331
00:33:48,641 --> 00:33:50,161
I looked after him.
Where have you been?

332
00:33:50,321 --> 00:33:52,801
In the north and west wing,
where there are dozens

333
00:33:52,961 --> 00:33:55,321
of patients from Chernobyl
exactly like him.

334
00:33:55,481 --> 00:33:57,241
- It isn't safe for you here.
- He's my husband.

335
00:33:57,401 --> 00:33:59,201
Not any more.
He's something else now.

336
00:33:59,361 --> 00:34:01,521
Do you understand?
He's dangerous to you.

337
00:34:02,641 --> 00:34:04,881
He's burned.

338
00:34:05,041 --> 00:34:06,521
Go home.

339
00:34:07,521 --> 00:34:09,001
Please...

340
00:34:12,081 --> 00:34:14,241
I won't take much longer.
I...

341
00:34:18,201 --> 00:34:20,241
I don't want him to die though.

342
00:34:23,201 --> 00:34:25,481
Stay on the other side
of the plastic...

343
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,521
or I'll have you
removed by security.

344
00:35:25,441 --> 00:35:27,561
- Lyusya.
- Yes, my love.

345
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:32,401
Is it day?

346
00:35:33,161 --> 00:35:35,401
No, it's night-time now.

347
00:35:39,041 --> 00:35:41,001
I think I had a dream.

348
00:35:41,161 --> 00:35:43,161
And it's just gone.

349
00:35:44,441 --> 00:35:46,321
Vasya...

350
00:35:51,521 --> 00:35:53,641
we're gonna have a baby.

351
00:36:28,601 --> 00:36:30,241
The fire is out.

352
00:36:32,401 --> 00:36:33,921
It's out, Valery.

353
00:36:35,001 --> 00:36:37,561
The miners are making
incredible progress.

354
00:36:38,681 --> 00:36:41,681
They say the whole job
will be finished in four weeks.

355
00:36:43,161 --> 00:36:46,161
- Four weeks?
- Can you believe that?

356
00:36:52,881 --> 00:36:54,721
I know the job isn't over...

357
00:36:56,401 --> 00:36:58,201
but it's the beginning
of the end.

358
00:37:03,801 --> 00:37:06,201
I'm sorry to bother you,
Deputy Minister, but...

359
00:37:08,361 --> 00:37:09,681
it is the miners.

360
00:37:55,841 --> 00:37:59,681
What? You wouldn't give us fans.
It's too hot for clothes.

361
00:37:59,841 --> 00:38:03,321
So we're digging the old way,
the way our fathers mined.

362
00:38:04,481 --> 00:38:06,281
We're still wearing
the fucking hats.

363
00:38:07,001 --> 00:38:08,641
What do you want?

364
00:38:11,001 --> 00:38:13,081
You're not as protected now.

365
00:38:13,761 --> 00:38:16,161
Are you telling me
that'll make a difference?

366
00:38:21,201 --> 00:38:24,401
When this is over...
will they be looked after?

367
00:38:28,561 --> 00:38:30,201
I don't know.

368
00:38:40,801 --> 00:38:42,441
You don't know.

369
00:39:00,401 --> 00:39:04,641
So, the power level jumped
from 200 to 400 megawatts?

370
00:39:06,041 --> 00:39:09,361
Yes. Very fast.

371
00:39:10,801 --> 00:39:14,081
Why didn't you initiate
an emergency shutdown?

372
00:39:14,241 --> 00:39:16,601
Why didn't you press
the AZ-5 button?

373
00:39:18,161 --> 00:39:19,721
We did.

374
00:39:20,361 --> 00:39:22,481
I reported the increase
to Akimov,

375
00:39:22,641 --> 00:39:24,681
and he pressed the button.

376
00:39:26,201 --> 00:39:28,561
Leonid, that's...
that's not possible.

377
00:39:30,441 --> 00:39:33,721
He did. I swear.

378
00:39:34,841 --> 00:39:36,561
I saw him do it.

379
00:39:40,041 --> 00:39:42,161
And that's when it exploded.

380
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:46,321
What?

381
00:40:01,681 --> 00:40:03,121
Which room is Akimov?

382
00:40:03,281 --> 00:40:04,761
27.

383
00:40:18,921 --> 00:40:23,561
I pressed it before the explosion.
Before...

384
00:40:26,881 --> 00:40:30,321
Why?
Why would that happen?

385
00:40:32,481 --> 00:40:35,361
I shut it down.
I pressed AZ-5.

386
00:40:41,321 --> 00:40:43,321
Thank you, Comrade Akimov.

387
00:40:47,801 --> 00:40:49,801
I did everything right.

388
00:40:51,241 --> 00:40:53,241
I did everything right.

389
00:41:23,081 --> 00:41:25,761
Get out. Get out!
Get out of here.

390
00:41:25,921 --> 00:41:28,041
Let me go. Let me go!

391
00:41:28,201 --> 00:41:30,281
- Stop it. Stop it!
- Get out.

392
00:41:33,161 --> 00:41:35,841
You let her in that room, inside
the plastic, touching him?

393
00:41:36,001 --> 00:41:38,481
- Did you know she's pregnant?
- It's not true.

394
00:41:38,641 --> 00:41:40,801
- What have you done?
- What kind of a place is this?

395
00:41:40,961 --> 00:41:42,121
Where is her protection?

396
00:41:42,281 --> 00:41:44,201
Do you have any idea
what you're dealing with?

397
00:41:44,361 --> 00:41:46,441
- Of course, I do. Please, I...
- No!

398
00:41:46,601 --> 00:41:48,601
- People will hear about this.
- Wait.

399
00:41:48,761 --> 00:41:50,481
People are going to hear.
Understand?

400
00:41:50,641 --> 00:41:52,281
Everyone is going to hear.

401
00:41:52,441 --> 00:41:54,441
What is everyone gonna hear?

402
00:42:00,161 --> 00:42:02,161
I am with the official
Chernobyl Commission.

403
00:42:02,321 --> 00:42:04,241
I've been authorised
by Valery Legasov.

404
00:42:04,401 --> 00:42:07,201
- You can check. My name is...
- We know who you are.

405
00:42:10,641 --> 00:42:12,641
What is everyone gonna hear?

406
00:42:32,481 --> 00:42:34,881
- You have your notes?
- Yes.

407
00:42:38,161 --> 00:42:39,721
Khomyuk was arrested
last night.

408
00:42:39,881 --> 00:42:41,281
What?

409
00:42:41,441 --> 00:42:43,361
- Why?
- I don't know.

410
00:42:44,921 --> 00:42:46,801
Was it...

411
00:42:46,961 --> 00:42:48,721
Of course it was.

412
00:42:49,801 --> 00:42:51,801
- I'm working on it.
- Boris...

413
00:42:51,961 --> 00:42:53,441
I'm working on it.

414
00:42:54,801 --> 00:42:58,121
What more do you want from me?
Fix your tie.

415
00:43:04,321 --> 00:43:05,721
They'll see you now.

416
00:43:15,721 --> 00:43:18,521
After thousands of sorties,
our brave helicopter crews

417
00:43:18,681 --> 00:43:20,561
successfully extinguished
the fire.

418
00:43:21,241 --> 00:43:23,201
The miners are working
heroically to ensure

419
00:43:23,361 --> 00:43:25,081
the fuel does not reach
the groundwater

420
00:43:25,241 --> 00:43:26,441
and, furthermore,

421
00:43:26,601 --> 00:43:29,041
there's no longer a threat
of additional explosion.

422
00:43:29,641 --> 00:43:31,601
The Soviet people
have faced the challenge

423
00:43:31,761 --> 00:43:35,001
and risen to the task, and they
and everyone in this room

424
00:43:35,161 --> 00:43:36,881
are to be commended.

425
00:43:41,281 --> 00:43:43,681
Lastly, Professor Legasov and I
have been vigilant

426
00:43:43,841 --> 00:43:46,041
to protect the security
interests of the state.

427
00:43:46,201 --> 00:43:48,241
Since the unfortunate
release of information

428
00:43:48,401 --> 00:43:49,841
following the accident,

429
00:43:50,001 --> 00:43:53,041
we believe that there has been
no further lapse.

430
00:43:53,201 --> 00:43:56,441
Comrade Charkov...
we hope we have lived up to

431
00:43:56,601 --> 00:43:59,041
the highest standards
of the KGB.

432
00:43:59,201 --> 00:44:01,761
- You have.
- Thank you.

433
00:44:03,001 --> 00:44:07,561
Professor Legasov will now speak
about the work that remains.

434
00:44:09,641 --> 00:44:11,201
Thank you.

435
00:44:14,761 --> 00:44:17,481
Deputy Chairman Shcherbina
has given you the good news,

436
00:44:17,641 --> 00:44:19,281
and it is good.

437
00:44:19,441 --> 00:44:21,921
The immediate danger is over.

438
00:44:22,081 --> 00:44:24,361
Now, I'm afraid,
a long war must begin.

439
00:44:26,601 --> 00:44:28,921
There is an enormous amount
of radioactive debris

440
00:44:29,081 --> 00:44:31,041
and contamination
spread out across a zone

441
00:44:31,201 --> 00:44:33,241
of approximately
2,600 square kilometres.

442
00:44:33,401 --> 00:44:37,561
This entire region must be
completely evacuated.

443
00:44:38,721 --> 00:44:42,001
We must go to every town,
every village, to ensure this.

444
00:44:44,321 --> 00:44:48,041
All animals still surviving
within the zone,

445
00:44:48,201 --> 00:44:50,841
whether domesticated or wild,

446
00:44:51,001 --> 00:44:52,881
must be presumed contaminated

447
00:44:53,041 --> 00:44:54,801
and will have to be destroyed

448
00:44:54,961 --> 00:44:57,801
to prevent the spread
of radiation and disease.

449
00:44:58,961 --> 00:45:01,561
In the immediate area
surrounding Chernobyl,

450
00:45:01,721 --> 00:45:04,561
every rock, every tree,

451
00:45:04,721 --> 00:45:07,161
the very ground itself,

452
00:45:07,321 --> 00:45:10,241
has absorbed a dangerous amount
of radionuclides,

453
00:45:10,401 --> 00:45:12,561
which will be carried
by the wind and the rain

454
00:45:12,721 --> 00:45:15,841
if left exposed, so we will
have to raze entire forests.

455
00:45:16,001 --> 00:45:17,881
We will have to rip up
the top layer of earth

456
00:45:18,041 --> 00:45:19,361
and bury it under itself,

457
00:45:19,521 --> 00:45:22,401
approximately
100 square kilometres.

458
00:45:24,561 --> 00:45:26,161
And finally,

459
00:45:26,321 --> 00:45:29,721
we will need to construct
a containment structure

460
00:45:29,881 --> 00:45:32,481
around the power plant itself,

461
00:45:32,641 --> 00:45:35,521
which will, of course,
still be extremely...

462
00:45:38,521 --> 00:45:40,241
There will be deaths.

463
00:45:43,601 --> 00:45:46,961
What amount of time
and how many men do you require?

464
00:45:47,121 --> 00:45:50,561
We expect this liquidation
effort to take three years

465
00:45:50,721 --> 00:45:52,961
and approximately 750,000 men,

466
00:45:53,121 --> 00:45:56,761
including a number of doctors
and structural engineers.

467
00:45:58,201 --> 00:45:59,961
How many deaths?

468
00:46:00,641 --> 00:46:04,161
Thousands.
Perhaps tens of thousands.

469
00:46:12,161 --> 00:46:13,681
Begin at once.

470
00:46:19,161 --> 00:46:21,081
- Comrade Charkov.
- Valery!

471
00:46:22,841 --> 00:46:24,281
Yes, Professor?

472
00:46:25,241 --> 00:46:28,001
My associate
was arrested last night.

473
00:46:30,281 --> 00:46:31,561
I mean no disrespect,

474
00:46:31,721 --> 00:46:34,001
but I was wondering
if you could tell me why.

475
00:46:34,161 --> 00:46:35,881
I don't know
who you're talking about.

476
00:46:36,041 --> 00:46:38,041
She was arrested by the KGB.

477
00:46:38,721 --> 00:46:41,441
You are the First
Deputy Chairman of the KGB.

478
00:46:41,601 --> 00:46:44,201
I am. That's why
I don't have to bother with

479
00:46:44,361 --> 00:46:45,801
arresting people any more.

480
00:46:45,961 --> 00:46:48,201
But you are bothering
with having us followed.

481
00:46:49,641 --> 00:46:51,841
I think the Deputy Chairman
is busy.

482
00:46:52,001 --> 00:46:54,041
No, no.
It's perfectly understandable.

483
00:46:54,201 --> 00:46:57,481
Comrade, I know you've heard
the stories about us.

484
00:46:58,081 --> 00:47:00,161
When I hear them,
even I am shocked.

485
00:47:00,321 --> 00:47:02,081
But we are not what people say.

486
00:47:02,241 --> 00:47:04,841
Yes, people are following you.

487
00:47:05,001 --> 00:47:07,001
People are following
those people.

488
00:47:07,721 --> 00:47:09,441
You see them?

489
00:47:10,841 --> 00:47:12,641
They follow me.

490
00:47:12,801 --> 00:47:16,361
The KGB is a circle
of accountability.

491
00:47:16,521 --> 00:47:17,721
Nothing more.

492
00:47:17,881 --> 00:47:19,881
You know the work
we're doing here.

493
00:47:21,561 --> 00:47:24,121
- You really don't trust us?
- Of course I do.

494
00:47:24,801 --> 00:47:28,761
But you know the old Russian proverb.
Trust but verify.

495
00:47:31,241 --> 00:47:34,401
And the Americans think that
Ronald Reagan thought that up.

496
00:47:34,561 --> 00:47:36,001
Can you imagine?

497
00:47:36,681 --> 00:47:38,681
It was very nice
speaking with you.

498
00:47:39,441 --> 00:47:40,841
I need her.

499
00:47:43,441 --> 00:47:45,801
So, you will be accountable
for her?

500
00:47:50,201 --> 00:47:51,681
Then it's done.

501
00:47:52,641 --> 00:47:54,721
- Her name...
- I know who she is.

502
00:47:55,641 --> 00:47:57,641
Good day, Professor.

503
00:48:06,681 --> 00:48:09,561
Well, that went
surprisingly well.

504
00:48:10,241 --> 00:48:12,241
You came off like a naive idiot.

505
00:48:13,601 --> 00:48:15,921
Naive idiots are not a threat.

506
00:48:31,121 --> 00:48:33,961
I'll come back
when the paperwork's complete.

507
00:48:41,081 --> 00:48:43,641
- Are you all right?
- They didn't hurt me.

508
00:48:45,521 --> 00:48:47,801
They let a pregnant woman
into a room with a...

509
00:48:47,961 --> 00:48:49,961
Doesn't matter.

510
00:48:51,201 --> 00:48:53,201
They were stupid, I was stupid.

511
00:48:55,081 --> 00:48:56,841
Dyatlov won't talk to me.

512
00:48:58,201 --> 00:49:00,561
Akimov, yes,
Toptunov, yes, but...

513
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:05,041
Valery, Akimov...

514
00:49:06,801 --> 00:49:08,681
his face was gone.

515
00:49:11,081 --> 00:49:12,641
You want to stop?

516
00:49:14,481 --> 00:49:16,481
Is that a choice I even have?

517
00:49:24,521 --> 00:49:26,881
Do you think the fuel
will actually melt through

518
00:49:27,041 --> 00:49:28,961
- the concrete pad?
- I don't know.

519
00:49:29,121 --> 00:49:30,921
40% chance maybe.

520
00:49:33,681 --> 00:49:36,321
I said 50.

521
00:49:36,481 --> 00:49:39,521
Either way, the numbers
mean the same thing. Maybe.

522
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:45,201
Maybe the core will melt
through to the groundwater.

523
00:49:45,921 --> 00:49:48,321
Maybe the miners I've told
to dig under the reactor

524
00:49:48,481 --> 00:49:50,481
will save millions of lives.

525
00:49:51,761 --> 00:49:53,921
Maybe I'm killing them
for nothing.

526
00:49:57,921 --> 00:49:59,921
I don't wanna do this any more.

527
00:50:00,841 --> 00:50:02,721
I want to stop...

528
00:50:04,121 --> 00:50:05,601
but I can't.

529
00:50:06,961 --> 00:50:09,681
I don't think you have a choice
any more than I do.

530
00:50:11,281 --> 00:50:16,801
I think, despite the stupidity,
the lies, even this,

531
00:50:16,961 --> 00:50:18,841
you're compelled.

532
00:50:19,001 --> 00:50:20,361
The problem has been assigned

533
00:50:20,521 --> 00:50:22,881
and you will stop at nothing
until you find an answer,

534
00:50:23,041 --> 00:50:25,841
because that is who you are.

535
00:50:27,761 --> 00:50:29,521
A lunatic then.

536
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:32,921
A scientist.

537
00:50:53,721 --> 00:50:56,561
Did you know that they were
running a safety test?

538
00:50:57,801 --> 00:50:59,801
- Yeah.
- There's something else.

539
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:04,601
Akimov says
they shut the reactor down,

540
00:51:04,761 --> 00:51:07,081
and Toptunov confirms it.

541
00:51:07,241 --> 00:51:10,681
- They pressed the AZ-5.
- Apparently not soon enough.

542
00:51:10,841 --> 00:51:12,161
No...

543
00:51:12,321 --> 00:51:16,241
They say Akimov pressed AZ-5...

544
00:51:16,961 --> 00:51:19,121
and then the reactor exploded.

545
00:51:20,881 --> 00:51:22,281
If it had been just one of them,

546
00:51:22,441 --> 00:51:25,121
I would've put it down
to faulty memory, or...

547
00:51:25,281 --> 00:51:28,001
delusion, even,
but they both agreed.

548
00:51:28,161 --> 00:51:30,321
They were adamant.

549
00:51:33,841 --> 00:51:35,561
Comrade.

550
00:51:37,481 --> 00:51:40,441
- Do you think it's possible?
- I think it makes no sense.

551
00:51:40,601 --> 00:51:41,961
I think it's what I would say

552
00:51:42,121 --> 00:51:44,201
if I was trying to cover
my own mistakes.

553
00:51:44,801 --> 00:51:46,721
But?

554
00:51:46,881 --> 00:51:48,681
I believe them.

555
00:51:50,361 --> 00:51:52,081
Then you should pursue it.

556
00:51:52,641 --> 00:51:55,801
We have to pursue
every possibility,

557
00:51:55,961 --> 00:51:57,721
no matter how unlikely...

558
00:51:58,721 --> 00:52:01,281
no matter what
or who is to blame.

559
00:52:02,721 --> 00:52:04,081
I'll go back to the hospital

560
00:52:04,241 --> 00:52:06,721
and re-interview Akimov
and Toptunov...

561
00:52:09,361 --> 00:52:10,921
if they're still awake.

562
00:52:12,121 --> 00:52:13,721
They're not.

563
00:52:15,401 --> 00:52:17,041
Khomyuk.
