1
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,800
Eva, this is Iben. My girlfriend.

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,780
You just made out a bit?

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:11,300
You just follow
what everyone else finds exciting.

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,940
Chris hooked up with someone at the party.
I saw it.

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,640
- You saw it?
- Yeah, on the stairs.

6
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:18,510
On the stairs?

7
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,860
I got a pretty unpleasant phone call
from the other girls yesterday.

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,740
They're saying that as long as Eva is on our bus,
we are all blacklisted.

9
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,620
I don't understand why you're attacking Eva,
when the other girls are the enemy.

10
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,220
Jonas and Ingrid used to be a couple.

11
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:36,040
So I think Eva only has herself to
blame for being in this situation.

12
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,000
SHAME

13
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,080
MONDAY, 7:28 A.M.

14
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,810
HI, EVA

WE WANTED TO WISH YOU
AND YOUR FRIENDS GOOD LUCK
WITH THE REST OF THE
SCHOOL YEAR, YOU'LL NEED IT

GREETINGS FROM RAD

PS. ON THE BACK THERE'S A
GREETING IN PERIOD BLOOD

15
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,440
WE WANTED TO WISH YOU
AND YOUR FRIENDS
GOOD LUCK WITH
THE REST OF THE SCHOOL YEAR,
YOU'LL NEED IT

16
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,180
GREETINGS FROM RAD


PS. ON THE BACK THERE'S
A GREETING IN PERIOD BLOOD

17
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:16,310
GREETINGS FROM RAD

PS. ON THE BACK THERE'S
A GREETING IN PERIOD BLOOD

18
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,110
Hi.

19
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,250
Hi.

20
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,540
You were right.

21
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:08,060
The Rad girls are after the entire bus.

22
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:14,260
Whatever. I'm not on the bus anymore.

23
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,180
Why not?

24
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:21,460
Why bother being on a blacklisted bus,
where everyone hates me?

25
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,780
No one hates you, Vilde.

26
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,940
Sana made it pretty clear.

27
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:36,060
Anyway, I'm back with the Pepsi Max girls.

28
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:40,360
Oh.

29
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,500
Vilde...

30
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,970
I just... want you to know...

31
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:57,640
that I'm not the kind of person
who steals other people's boyfriends.

32
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,540
What kind of person are you then?

33
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:13,770
TUESDAY, 6:32 P.M.

34
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:35,140
The image I see when I think of Foss
is a dude jamming on his guitar.

35
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:39,260
When I enter through the front entrance,
I see that majestic staircase.

36
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,600
I strongly recommend this school.

37
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:57,360
How can you change high school

38
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:59,510
How can you change high schools?

39
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,800
Is it possible to change high schools?
If it is, how can you do it?

40
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:25,080
To: Oslo Municipality's Admissions Office

41
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,220
Hi!

SKYPE: Isak calling

60
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,370
Hi.

61
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,030
Hi.

62
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,550
You weren't at school today.

63
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,510
No.

64
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,750
I think it's...

65
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,780
really unfair that you
get this much hate.

66
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,600
I have decided to change schools.

67
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:24,780
- Why?
- Because everything is fucked at Nissen.

68
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:29,500
So because of that
you're just going to change schools?

69
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,100
Yes.

70
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,240
Okay...

71
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,780
Okay, what?

72
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,020
It's just not very typical of you.

73
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,210
What's that supposed to mean?

74
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,810
I didn't know you were a quitter.

75
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,300
What is this bullshit
about what kind of person I am?

76
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,530
Maybe I am a quitter.

77
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,300
I don't know!
How can I know what kind of person I am?

78
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:04,420
Everyone is like: "What kind of person are you?
You have to know who you are!"

79
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,430
It's a fucking clichÃ©.

80
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:08,730
Yeah, okay.

81
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,140
Just chill.

82
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,940
I didn't mean it like that.

83
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,210
Sorry.

84
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,500
No, no...

85
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,360
But...

86
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,350
It's actually...

87
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:28,030
not that complicated, Eva.

88
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,300
You...

89
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:33,460
You are what you do.

90
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:39,650
So... if you change schools,
because things are a bit fucked up, then...

91
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:42,050
you are a quitter.

92
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,200
I'm not five years old.

93
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:50,500
Do you think that
reverse psychology shit works on me?

94
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,360
I don't know. Does it?

95
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,580
You've got to fight back, girl.

96
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:16,010
WEDNESDAY, 1:30 P.M.

97
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,760
What is it?

98
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:02,320
Are you Maria? The bus boss from Rad?

99
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,520
Yes.

100
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,890
- I'm Eva.
- Okay.

101
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,860
I'm that Eva.

102
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,660
Okay.

103
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,660
I just wanted to say that I got your letter.

104
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,530
I know I fucked up,

105
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:32,400
but I think it's unfair to blacklist
the entire bus. My friends didn't do anything.

106
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:36,260
It was me. So, take me, not them.

107
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,700
Okay, Eva...

108
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:44,990
You can tell your friends that
we won't "take" them.

109
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:49,530
We have way more important stuff to do
than blacklisting first-years.

110
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,420
So...

111
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:55,320
okay, what's up with the letter then?

112
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:59,170
We haven't given you any letter.
Someone's fucking with you.

113
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,250
So...

114
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,140
you guys aren't mad
that I hooked up with Chris?

115
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:08,410
Eva, we don't give a shit
who you've hooked up with.

116
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:13,710
Even though it's Iben's boyfriend?

117
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:18,100
Even though it's Iben's boyfriend. Eva, listen.

118
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:21,180
I'm sure that in your head,
this hook-up

119
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:24,810
is the most important and dramatic thing
ever in history.

120
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,620
But for us who have been here for a while,
it's just a little footnote.

121
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,000
So I suggest you talk to the ones involved, okay?

122
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,910
Okay.

123
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:40,540
And relax. Right?

124
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:43,150
You're supposed to fuck up,
you're in the first year.

125
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,430
You're supposed to hook up a lot.

126
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,120
But don't sleep around.
That's different, ok?

127
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:53,570
When we were in our first year,
we had a chlamydia epidemic.

128
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,390
- Did anyone find out who started it?
- It was William.

129
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,730
- It wasn't William.
- Weren't you...

130
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:02,210
- Chris had it too, right?
- Yeah, Chris had it too.

131
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,600
It was one of those guys for sure...

132
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:26,010
THURSDAY, 1:00 P.M.

133
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,950
- I see where you went wrong.
- I didn't do anything wrong.

134
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:33,210
- It's okay to make mistakes, Sana.
- The answer key is wrong.

135
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,900
The answer key isn't wrong, Sana.

136
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:40,100
It is wrong!
Because it's not the same as what I got.

137
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:43,620
Hi!

138
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,470
Hi.

139
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,780
I talked to the Rad girls.

140
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:57,980
- And... they aren't after us.
- Wow, now I can finally breathe again!

141
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:01,320
Hey, it's Vilde
who cares about that stuff,

142
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:06,070
and is peeing her pants
about some blacklist.

143
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,180
Vilde...

144
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:13,320
- She isn't on our bus anymore.
- Huh?

145
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:19,270
She said she didn't want to be
on a bus where...

146
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,300
everyone hates her.

147
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,960
Something's wrong.

148
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:32,110
At the bus meeting,
she was mean, and Vilde isn't a mean person.

149
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,250
What?

150
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:42,150
It seems like you just defended Vilde?

151
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,330
I'm just saying, something's wrong.

152
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,400
We are her friends.

153
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:51,170
You guys should care more about her.

154
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,300
Okay...

155
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,140
Guys...

156
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,830
I feel like I owe you guys
an explanation.

157
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:11,620
About what... Vilde said
about me and Ingrid.

158
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,300
But I don't have one.

159
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:20,390
- I know I should've done things differently--
- Eva.

160
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,860
- Save that speech for Ingrid.
- Fuck Ingrid!

161
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:28,560
You don't owe her shit. She was sucking up
to Iben and hooked up with Chris herself.

162
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,660
I'm sure it was her who sent that period letter.

163
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:38,100
- Wh-What did you say?
- Don't you think it was her? I think so.

164
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,550
Did Ingrid hook up with Chris?

165
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,790
Yes, I told you, at the Halloween party,
she and Chris were making out on the stairs.

166
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,880
- Are you kidding me?
- No, I saw it!

167
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,370
And you're telling me this now?!

168
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:54,140
What? I told you before.

169
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,220
I thought I had already told you.

170
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,740
FRIDAY, 1:40 P.M.

171
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:20,230
We have to talk.

172
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:25,760
Unless you want me to tell Iben
that you hooked up with Chris,

173
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:28,190
I suggest you change your attitude.

174
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,150
I know you don't want to listen to me,
but you have to now.

175
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:41,570
Whether you want to or not, we'll be going
to the same school for the next three years.

176
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,360
We have to figure out
how to make this work somehow, because...

177
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:52,500
you can't keep trying to freeze me out,
talking shit, or sending me threat letters.

178
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:55,510
Just hear me out, okay?

179
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:10,590
When I moved here... from Bergen...
in the 7th grade...

180
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,950
And...

181
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,850
no one wanted to hang out with me,
because I talked weird.

182
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:21,180
Then you were the only one who took care of me.

183
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,730
And I...

184
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,930
remember how proud and lucky...

185
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,660
I just couldn't believe that

186
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,950
the most popular girl in our class
wanted to be friends with me.

187
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,180
I have...

188
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:48,760
always looked up to you like crazy.

189
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,020
You're the...

190
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,580
best friend I've ever had.

191
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,900
And just...

192
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,040
the thought...

193
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,390
that I managed to destroy that...

194
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,940
makes me feel sick.

195
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,400
More than sick.

196
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:20,380
It made me stop liking myself as a person.

197
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:29,160
But I can't keep regretting it...

198
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,660
for the rest of my life.

199
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:38,910
It wasn't going well
between you and Jonas.

200
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:42,900
You talked about
breaking up with him every day.

201
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:47,730
And I know that's not an excuse, but...

202
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:53,060
I loved him.

203
00:15:55,460 --> 00:16:00,470
I wish I could do it all over again,
in a completely different way.

204
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,180
But I can't.

205
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:11,530
I'm just going to have to accept that.

206
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,940
And move on.

207
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:19,010
So, I'm saying this for the last time.

208
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,240
Okay?

209
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:27,070
I'm sorry.

210
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:35,270
I'm sorry that I lied to you,
and went behind your back.

211
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,620
I'm sorry that I ruined our friendship.

212
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:47,630
You didn't deserve it.

213
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:59,920
I'm not trying to say...

214
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,390
you should like me, or...

215
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:06,440
or that we should be friends again or something.

216
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:08,270
I just...

217
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,890
I can't take any more
shit talk or threat letters, okay?

218
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,640
Okay.

219
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:22,970
No more shit.

220
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,500
But I didn't send any threat letters.

221
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:34,370
And I barely knew Iben when I
hooked up with Chris at the Halloween party.

222
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,200
Fucking hell!

223
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:46,540
Seriously? You have serious issues!

224
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:51,450
What's wrong with you?! You can't just
jump people! Pull yourself together!

225
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:54,810
You're with the school's largest douche.
He's hitting on everyone,

226
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:59,740
and your way of coping with that is to
jump people, beat them up, send threat letters?

227
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,030
I have a better suggestion for you.

228
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:07,370
Break up with your fucking boyfriend.
He's a fucking asshole.

229
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,560
I didn't mean it like that.

230
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:26,380
No, it's okay.

231
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:30,170
I know it's true, so...

232
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,830
I just...

233
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,890
I think you deserve better.

234
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:42,340
Everyone deserves better than that.

235
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,830
I love him.

236
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:53,650
Maybe he'll change.

237
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:05,260
It was good that he told you, at least.

238
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,750
What?

239
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:10,710
That he had cheated.

240
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:14,290
He didn't tell me.

241
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:16,700
- He didn't?
- No.

242
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:21,910
Oh... because someone...

243
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:25,230
told me that's how you
got to know about it.

244
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:28,210
That your boyfriend told you.

245
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:33,710
My boyfriend?
It was your boyfriend who tipped me off.

246
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,590
My boyfriend?

247
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,150
Yes.

248
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,380
But... my boyfriend didn't know.

249
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:48,560
He must have known.
He's the one who sent the tip to Nissenhook.

250
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,760
That's how I found out about it.

251
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:53,860
Huh?

252
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,760
The little blonde guy.
The one you're always with.

253
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:58,330
Isn't he your boyfriend?

254
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:01,900
Isakyaki? Isak?
Isn't that what he's called?

255
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:07,200
Did Isak send the tip?

256
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:14,390
I thought you knew.
