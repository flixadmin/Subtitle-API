1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,120
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,760
- The Doc. You know him?
- Oh, I know The Doc.

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,600
Sometimes we search for things
we don't wish to find.

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,240
I'm enjoy being the queen of Gotham.

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,560
Glad we understand each other.

6
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,320
There are other ways for me
to hurt you.

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,680
Something's eating in you, Jim.

8
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,920
And you're not gonna feel clean
until you get it off your chest.

9
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,520
That's done now.

10
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,280
I'm at Sofia Falcone's.

11
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,000
I just shot and killed the Pyg.

12
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,760
I see Arkham's treating you well.

13
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,600
Good-bye, Oswald.

14
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,200
I am held captive
of my brilliance locked away.

15
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,480
You're still there.

16
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,240
And you're gonna help me
find a way out of here.

17
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,800
- I need a name.
- Ivy Pepper.

18
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,200
- I know Ivy.
- No, Gordon, she's changed.

19
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,320
Like, a lot.

20
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,920
Called Lazarus Water.

21
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,480
What are you going to do with it?

22
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,600
I'm going to make miracles happen.

23
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,760
You reel it in a little?

24
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,040
Or should I call your keeper?

25
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,640
Call Alfred. He won't answer.

26
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,400
- Why?
- Because I fired him.

27
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,280
Where is the other guy
who works here?

28
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,280
You mean Harvey? He's out sick.

29
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,240
You wanna leave him a message?

30
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,440
I do.

31
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,000
Alright. What should I say?

32
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,880
Nothing.

33
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,400
Because all of you

34
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,240
with your blood and your flesh

35
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,680
and what you will become...

36
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,400
you are the message.

37
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,200
{\an5}He was a good man.

38
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,600
{\an5}It doesn't matter that Mario's gone
you'll always be my sister.

39
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,400
{\an5}For Falcone, it's all about family.

40
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,160
{\an5}Appreciate that.

41
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,280
{\an5}So, sister to sister...

42
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,080
{\an5}we're not really here
look at photographs.

43
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,800
{\an5}There's only one neighborhood
in Gotham

44
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,640
{\an5}that hasn't bend the knee.

45
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,200
{\an5}The Narrows is never submitted
to an outside boss.

46
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,440
{\an5}There's never been
someone like me ruling Gotham.

47
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,600
Okay.

48
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,080
{\an5}- What do you want?
- A tax.

49
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,680
{\an5}Thirty percent in all income coming
for The Narrows legal and illegal.

50
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,800
{\an5}Every family there lives
hand to mouth, they'll starve.

51
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,240
{\an5}But we all have
to make sacrifices.

52
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,960
{\an5}I'll need the answer
by the end of the day.

53
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,920
{\an5}You want me to kiss the ring,
I'll do it. To keep the peace.

54
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,160
{\an5}But what you are asking for
is impossible.

55
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,120
{\an5}You'll find a way.

56
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,640
{\an5}I thought it was all about family.

57
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,720
{\an5}Never said it was a happy family.

58
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,680
{\an5}Thank you.

59
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,600
Thank you for meeting me.

60
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,280
{\an5}My parents foundation is having
their annual dinner tonight.

61
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,400
{\an5}- I thought we...
- Somehow I don't think you called me

62
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,080
{\an5}all the way down here to talk
about a fundraiser, did you?

63
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,040
{\an5}Bruce, what exactly is it
that you want from me?

64
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,200
Help.

65
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,440
Figuring this out,
I can't do it alone, I...

66
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,920
Alfred, I need your help.

67
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,800
No.

68
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,800
- What?
- Listen, you can't just waltz

69
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,120
back in here and expect me to go and
clean your s'mores and cook your tea.

70
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,160
- After what you've done...
- Alfred, I'm not asking for that

71
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,120
- I've changed.
- Oh, you have, have you?

72
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,360
So, it's one thing saying
that you changed

73
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,360
and another actually changing so...

74
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,480
show me.

75
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,360
Show me how you changed
and I might reconsider.

76
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,480
Show you how?

77
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,360
That's for you to figure out, innit?

78
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,120
I'm asking as a friend.

79
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,480
I'm not your friend.

80
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,720
I was your butler.

81
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,880
And you fired me.

82
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,280
He'll pay for the tea, miss.

83
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,920
Sure hope Lee is gonna
figure something out with Sofia.

84
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,800
Leaving the love of your life
and all.

85
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,720
We're friends.

86
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,960
You know, those koo-koo pills
aren't gonna make me go away.

87
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,640
Well, they have stopped you
from getting out

88
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,720
and trying to kill Lee again
so works for me!

89
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,440
Mail arrived.

90
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,600
Who's it from?

91
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,640
Oswald.

92
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,200
<i>"I want to apologize.</i>

93
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,000
<i>Can we be friends again?"</i>

94
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,600
What? What does he...
I'm never gonna forgive him.

95
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,320
Oh, I think it's a nice letter.

96
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,280
Oh, shut up!

97
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,240
Hey, Ed.
What has two eyes but can't see?

98
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,640
What has two...

99
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,960
Good Lord.

100
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,200
This is new. More aggressive.

101
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,600
The plants are literally bursting
through their flesh.

102
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,640
You.

103
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,200
Get away from that. Now. Now.

104
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,440
Same flower growing out of
these bodies.

105
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,360
That's a weapon?

106
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,320
Gordon, this must be what Ivy do
with the Lazarus Water.

107
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,800
Used it to increase
the potency of a toxic plant.

108
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,960
The seeds made it airborne...

109
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,560
- Where is Bullock?
- What?

110
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,640
He works here.

111
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,680
Harvey killed Ivy's father.

112
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,800
Clear.

113
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,160
- Too late.
- No, we're not.

114
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,880
Hey.

115
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,400
Hey.

116
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,160
Damn it, Jim.

117
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,000
Jim, what the hell?

118
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,280
Hey, someone's paying for that door.

119
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,400
Ivy Pepper.

120
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,760
- Who?
- Mario Pepper's kid.

121
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,960
She's been working on some biotech.

122
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,400
She attacked your bar.

123
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,040
It's bad.

124
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,080
Donnie, the bartender?

125
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,960
I'm sorry.

126
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,440
- Oh, God.
- Look.

127
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,480
I gotta think
that you were the target.

128
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,600
Jim, I only shot Ivy Pepper's Dad

129
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,120
because I was saving
your stupid hide.

130
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,520
You can't put this on me!

131
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,480
- I'm not putting in on you!
- Guys!

132
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,360
<i>Public safety we have to decide
to share the footage.</i>

133
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,640
<i>So in a moment the video
we're about to show you</i>

134
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,520
<i>is form a tape received this morning.</i>

135
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,880
<i>And again let me warn you</i>

136
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,080
<i>it is very disturbing.</i>

137
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,360
<i>Plants love us.</i>

138
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,000
<i>They gave us food, shelter</i>

139
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,480
<i>the very air we breathe.</i>

140
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,480
<i>And what we do in return?</i>

141
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,040
<i>Kill them.</i>

142
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,720
<i>Because that's our nature.</i>

143
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,480
<i>We cause pain.</i>

144
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,280
<i>Everyone I've known
has only hurt or betrayed me.</i>

145
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,720
<i>Maybe I've always known in my heart
when I needed to do.</i>

146
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,720
<i>But I finally had the power
to do so.</i>

147
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,800
<i>I'm giving your city
back to the plants.</i>

148
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,760
<i>Starting with the people
who hurt me.</i>

149
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,400
<i>So, if that's you...</i>

150
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,480
<i>your time is coming.</i>

151
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,120
- Guess we know what she's up to.
- Yeah.

152
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,040
She's gonna kill everyone
in Gotham.

153
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,040
Starting with me.

154
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,360
{\an5}<i>Preliminary reports indicate that
similar tapes have been delivered</i>

155
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,480
<i>to multiple news organization...</i>

156
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,360
Wait a minute.

157
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,240
What's that there?

158
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,520
{\an5}Sully's eatery.

159
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,800
That's in Ives Square.
House must be right across.

160
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,360
You should go to the precinct.

161
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,040
Hey, I'm not hiding like
some freaking coward, all right?

162
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,520
Four people are dead
because she wanted me.

163
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,680
Okay, then we'll work on it together.
You can wear the badge.

164
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,120
Get this straight, Jim.
I ain't working for you now.

165
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,440
Or ever.

166
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,600
I got more contacts
in the Narrows than any of you.

167
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,600
I'm gonna find her. Alone.

168
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,920
Once I've found my pants.

169
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,320
It doesn't make any sense.

170
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,560
- There's no money here.
- Okay, so it's about power.

171
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,760
I offered to bend the knee.

172
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,440
She's asking for something
she knew I couldn't give.

173
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,800
She wants...

174
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,000
she wants to punish me.

175
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,840
For what?

176
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,360
I don't know.

177
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,880
But you can't fight an enemy
whose motivations

178
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,480
you don't understand, Lee.

179
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,640
You are the greatest spies
in all of Gotham.

180
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,880
You have eyes and ears everywhere.

181
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:59,240
The survival of the Narrows
depends upon you.

182
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,840
Whoever learns why Sofia Falcone

183
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,560
wants to destroy Lee Thompkins
will receive...

184
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,680
a complete set of encyclopedias.

185
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,200
Minus the T.

186
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,880
- Plus 20 bucks.
- Yeah.

187
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,360
- Yes.
- Yeah.

188
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,440
Go get them.

189
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,800
Incoming.

190
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,320
- Eyes for movement.
- Clear.

191
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,560
She wasn't bluffing.

192
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,680
With this many plants, she could kill
hundreds if not thousands of people.

193
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,320
Search the other room for any signs
of where she's heading.

194
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,600
What are you gonna do to her?

195
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,600
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

196
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,240
I just saw the news.

197
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,440
She killed four more people today.

198
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,120
You knew where she was staying.

199
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,920
If you had told me,
we could've saved lives.

200
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,040
Or not.

201
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,480
I mean, you couldn't even stop her
from hypnotizing your own cops.

202
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,160
So why'd you come here?

203
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,480
To try to reason with her?

204
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,880
Have you heard a word she said?

205
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,840
- She's a fanatic.
- She's my friend.

206
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,280
I mean, what do you expect me to do?

207
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,960
She contacts you again, call me.

208
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,640
I'll try and find her
and bring her in quietly.

209
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,560
Otherwise, stay out of her way.

210
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,760
- Harvey?
- Hey.

211
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,920
- I got a lead.
- Great.

212
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,280
I knocked some heads.

213
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,880
Heard a hot redhead was poking around
in that dive bar next door.

214
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,240
That is the place in The Narrows
for low-end muscles

215
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,080
so I figured if she was planning
something big,

216
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,240
she might've gone there to recruit.

217
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,000
That's the back entrance.
That's where my contact said that...

218
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,600
Hello, Detective Gordon.

219
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,520
On the ground now.
Harvey, call it in.

220
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,000
She's beautiful,
don't you think, Jim?

221
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,200
Drop your weapon.

222
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,600
You don't look good.

223
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,920
I think you might be exceeding
your recommended dosage.

224
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,440
You're experiencing
trembling extremities?

225
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,360
Check.

226
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,600
Cognitive impairment? Definite check.

227
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,400
Though, to be fair,
how would you know?

228
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,000
Shut up!

229
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,760
Take all the pills you want, Ed.
I'm only getting stronger.

230
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:43,720
Soon, I'm gonna be out,
and the fun begins!

231
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,040
No. I won't let you.
Because I know what you'll do.

232
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,960
Oh, you mean kill Lee?

233
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,720
Yeah, I guess I will do that.
And you can't stop me.

234
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,520
- There are things that I can do.
- Like what?

235
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,960
You need to face it, Pal.

236
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,480
The only way you'll get rid of me
is to kill yourself.

237
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,120
I guess you're smarter than me.

238
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,360
- You would actually...
- Oh, yeah.

239
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,560
Oh, yeah.

240
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,320
I said drop the gun, Jim.

241
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,920
Do you believe in fate,
Detective Gordon?

242
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:32,040
I went out today to test my plants
on the man who shot my father.

243
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,360
He wasn't there.

244
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,880
It's disappointing.

245
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,200
Then, he found me.

246
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,720
And I realized I could make him
deliver his partner as well.

247
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,320
- Fate.
- Stay strong, Harvey.

248
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,720
- She's controlling you.
- I kinda like it, Jim.

249
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,840
Sweet surrender.

250
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,480
You need help, Ivy.

251
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,560
Let me find Selina,
she wants to help.

252
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,640
Quiet.

253
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,960
I have to go.

254
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,680
Big plans tonight,
lots of people to kill.

255
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,280
- Detective Bullock.
- Ma'am.

256
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,800
After you kill your partner...

257
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,360
be sure to shoot yourself
in the head, okay?

258
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,440
Copy that.

259
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,480
- Harvey.
- Don't even try

260
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,920
and talk your way out of this.

261
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,800
I wouldn't. But...

262
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,400
Quick question.

263
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,160
Is Ivy's hair more auburn or scarlet?

264
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,880
I... That's a good question.

265
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,040
Think I didn't come prepared?

266
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,600
You always underestimate me.

267
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,080
That's not why I'm shooting you.

268
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,560
I just think we should clear the air.

269
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,080
What do you want to talk about?
I'm all ears.

270
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,360
How you stole my job, for starters!

271
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,960
Was it really your job, though?

272
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,640
I mean, you only got it

273
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,280
'cause one captain died
and the other one went nuts.

274
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,360
Like hell!

275
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,720
I paid my dues. I earned that job
and you took it!

276
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,600
You mean like the time
you gut-shot Officer Patel?

277
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,640
That was... a mistake.

278
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,280
Hey, give yourself some credit.

279
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,400
You did shoot her
from across the room.

280
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,960
Although you couldn't face her later,
remember?

281
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,480
You didn't have the courage to meet
her the next day, did you?

282
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,240
- Coward!
- Screw you!

283
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,600
- We're not open.
- I wanted to see you.

284
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,280
Why? Because you weren't
big enough of an ass

285
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,880
the last time I saw you?

286
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,320
- Selina...
- I don't have time for this, Bruce.

287
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,640
Something happened.

288
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,880
- I need to talk to someone.
- Okay, then go find Alfred.

289
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,360
Oh, you did.

290
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,960
And he wanted nothing to do with you.

291
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,880
Smart guy, Alfred.

292
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,760
- Will you at least hear me out?
- No, Bruce.

293
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,520
Because Ivy's out there
killing people

294
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,000
and I need to find her and stop her.

295
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,720
So whatever problem you have
going on right now

296
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,480
you need to figure it out.

297
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,320
I mean, say sorry to Alfred.

298
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,000
Because I'm sure whatever happened
was your fault.

299
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,000
According to my spies...

300
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,720
Sofia and Jim
were carrying out an affair.

301
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,160
Till Jim ended it.

302
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,040
So technically,
your ex has been sleeping

303
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,840
with your dead husband's
mafiosa sister.

304
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,920
Okay, I get it.

305
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,920
If Sofia was sleeping
with the captain of the GCPD

306
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,040
it was a power play.

307
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,080
And it failed.

308
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,680
I'm her next step.

309
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,480
Why don't I just give her
what she wants?

310
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,000
Power over Jim Gordon.

311
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,120
You would do that?

312
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,520
I'm not trying to get back at Jim,
though he deserves it.

313
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,520
My job is to make sure that
the people of the Narrows are safe.

314
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,360
And I will do everything
in my power to ensure that.

315
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,200
What?

316
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,080
Lee, I...

317
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,760
I...

318
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,200
have to leave.

319
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,120
She's here...

320
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,280
Harvey.

321
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,840
- Harvey, come on.
- Where am I?

322
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,160
You were hypnotized.

323
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,600
I need you to focus.

324
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,280
Did Ivy give you any clue
about who she's targeting next?

325
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,720
I can't believe I let her get to me.

326
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,760
Hey, you wanna help? Here's how.
Did she say anything?

327
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:25,120
Something about,
"They get rich by murdering plants?"

328
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,000
So, she's targeting a group
of rich people?

329
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:33,960
At her place, she was trying on
fancy clothes, fancy shoes.

330
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,040
Party?

331
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,960
She said she had big plans,
couldn't be late.

332
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,520
- Yeah. Black tie. Fancy schmancy.
- No, no, come on, you gotta know...

333
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,160
Charity for hobos or something.

334
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:47,240
Wayne's Foundation Annual Dinner
is tonight, over at Gotham Square.

335
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,720
All right, give the strike force.

336
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,600
I want full body armor,
gas mask, non-lethal rounds.

337
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,760
To fight plants?

338
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,440
When Ivy got me, she was hypnotizing
a bunch of low-end muscle.

339
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,520
Go.

340
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,760
I could really use you there, Harv.

341
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,360
Jim, she got in my head.

342
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,640
I really... I just don't trust
myself right now.

343
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,120
All right, you can help out here.

344
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,760
Man the phones.

345
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,880
Hey, Jim...

346
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,680
I spent too long putting this
all on you.

347
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,520
What happened between us.

348
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,080
Fact is, I only got myself to blame.

349
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,880
I'll call.

350
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,400
And now, ladies and gentlemen

351
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:07,680
please welcome to the stage,
our host, Bruce Wayne.

352
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,160
Good evening.

353
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,360
Welcome to the third Annual Dinner

354
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,840
for the Thomas and Martha Wayne
Foundation.

355
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:32,040
This year, we disburse
four million dollars in...

356
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:45,600
We disbursed four million dollars
and...

357
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,680
My parents spent their lives
helping people.

358
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,400
I was so proud of them

359
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,440
and I always wanted them
to be proud of me.

360
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,840
And then I saw them get murdered.

361
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,160
I survived because someone
in my life kept me going.

362
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,200
He's been everything to me.

363
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,800
A teacher.

364
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,960
A protector.

365
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,600
He's been a father to me.

366
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,360
I hope...

367
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,080
I hope he can see that...

368
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,040
and give me another chance.

369
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,880
Thank you.

370
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,280
Thank you.

371
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,640
That meant a great deal.

372
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,880
But I can't help you.

373
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,600
Not until you accept
who you really are.

374
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,040
I know who I am,
I've seen what's inside of me.

375
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,040
Darkness and anger.

376
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,040
But what was beneath that...

377
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,400
it's a heart that feels pain.

378
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:34,720
Your heart is what makes you
want to help other people.

379
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,200
Your heart is your strength.

380
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:42,040
Deny the darkness,
and you deny that.

381
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,120
But accepting that is something
you must do on your own.

382
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,320
Do you understand me?

383
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,480
I was stupid for reaching out.

384
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,120
That was quite a speech.

385
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,920
Hello all.

386
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,520
I'm Ivy Pepper.

387
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,960
No, no, no, please.

388
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,200
Stay seated.

389
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,800
Can I just say...

390
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,120
this is crazy!

391
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,840
Look, this whole thing
was it your idea?

392
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,200
And you're the smart one,
as you always tell me?

393
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,680
Oh, very funny.

394
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,320
Okay, fine! Fine!

395
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,680
You win!

396
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,160
- What?
- You win.

397
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,480
You beat me.

398
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,840
Is that what you wanna hear?

399
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,280
That is very nice.

400
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,680
But I still have to do it.

401
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,680
Wait!

402
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,360
Wait, wait.

403
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,120
What if there's a way to do this
where nobody gets hurt?

404
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,360
I don't believe you.

405
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,080
So, you just gonna kill yourself
without hearing me out?

406
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,880
I'm telling you, Ed,
there was a way to save Lee

407
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,440
without killing yourself!

408
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,800
Or killing us.

409
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,240
I'm listening.

410
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:31,400
Aren't these crimson flowers lovely?

411
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,280
You're a handsome man.

412
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,360
But you want more from life.

413
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,240
I can feel it.

414
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,320
Bruce, is Ivy Pepper in there?

415
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,120
Ivy? No, I mean, I didn't see her.

416
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,880
Get out of here. Let's go!

417
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,520
Breach that door!

418
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:20,440
We are going to turn this room

419
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,880
into the most gorgeous garden
the world has ever seen.

420
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,400
All you have to do...

421
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,960
is take a deep breath.

422
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,000
A volunteer.

423
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,160
GCPD!

424
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,640
GCPD!

425
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,360
Drop your guns! On the ground now!

426
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,280
Kill everyone.

427
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,920
You got this, I'm going after Ivy.

428
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,920
I'm getting you out of here.
Come on, let's go.

429
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,080
Listen, listen...

430
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,520
people need your help.

431
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,760
This is who you are.

432
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,600
Watch the door,
I'm gonna go look left.

433
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,800
Where'd you go, punk?
You can run, but you can't hide.

434
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,000
Hey! Hey!

435
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,360
- Drop it!
- No.

436
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,120
Hey. Hey.

437
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,800
You hear the news?

438
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,440
"Crazy Ivy Pepper attacks
the Wayne Foundation dinner."

439
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,480
I'll be honest the evening didn't
turn out quite the way I'd hope.

440
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,000
You mean you didn't get to kill
everyone in there?

441
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,400
Something like that.

442
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:52,080
You got out, made it back here.

443
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,640
You always were the survivor.

444
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,240
Hey, you tell me that, Selina.

445
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,800
What's in the bag, Ivy?

446
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,720
It's the last the Lazarus water
I stole from Wayne Enterprises.

447
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:22,400
So you can go and make more plants
to kill people?

448
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,880
Yeah, that ain't gonna happen.

449
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,960
Are you gonna stop me, Selina?

450
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:39,080
Are you gonna remind me the old days?

451
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,080
Tell me I'm not this person.

452
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,760
No, I think we're past words now.

453
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,720
Well, Selina Kyle

454
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,520
turns out to be the hero.

455
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,240
I'm no hero.

456
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,120
One scratch is all it takes, Selina.

457
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,080
And there's no antidote this time.

458
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:24,760
And there's no more jumping across
rooftops for little dead Selina.

459
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,360
I'll keep that in mind.

460
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,000
You're gonna have to fight me,
Selina.

461
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,760
You can't run forever.

462
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,480
I wasn't running.

463
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,160
I was getting this.

464
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:48,480
This is what you're gonna use
to make all your little plants?

465
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:52,840
So, I guess it's safe to say
that I shouldn't drop it...

466
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,960
Stop, Selina.

467
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,840
- I will let you live.
- Let me?

468
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:05,320
You're not gonna turn me
into some geranium-type thing?

469
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,880
That's so generous.

470
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,800
No!

471
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,440
How can you side with them?

472
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,360
All the people who hurt us.

473
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,800
You think they're innocent?

474
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,880
They're guilty.

475
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,040
Every person in this city...

476
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,400
they spew out poison.

477
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,200
How are you not choking on it?

478
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,320
The only thing that I'm choking on,
Ivy, is your insanity.

479
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,440
No...

480
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,480
You shouldn't have done that.

481
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,000
- Now you're gonna die.
- Ivy, look down.

482
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,360
- Well...
- Yeah.

483
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,960
So what happens now?

484
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,440
- We kill each other?
- That's an option.

485
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,720
You always did think
you were better than me?

486
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,920
That's not true, I was your friend.

487
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,000
We were friends, Ivy.
You said so yourself.

488
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,760
That's a long time ago.

489
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,680
I'm a different person now.

490
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,800
This isn't what I want.

491
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,880
Don't get in my way again.

492
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,120
Lift your hands up.
You got any weapons?

493
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,880
I'd almost think this wasn't going
to be a friendly conversation.

494
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:27,800
Just being careful.

495
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,000
- They're clean.
- Okay.

496
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,840
Smart lady.

497
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,960
So you said you wanted 30 percent
of everything in the Narrows.

498
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,000
What if I told you I had something
more valuable to offer?

499
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,320
Such as?

500
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:44,640
Jim Gordon.

501
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,240
I know crimes he has committed
no one else does.

502
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,400
It would give you control over him.

503
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,280
Surely that's worth more
than 30 percent of this.

504
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,400
I have my own dirt on Jim Gordon.

505
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,600
But you can't use it.

506
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:05,240
Otherwise, you wouldn't be sitting
there threatening me, would you?

507
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,800
Sofia...

508
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,640
take my deal.

509
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,240
I have a better way
to bring Gordon around.

510
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,920
No! No!

511
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,240
Stay with me! Stay with me!

512
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,000
You are never gonna get out
of here alive.

513
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,520
My people are gonna kill you!

514
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,480
Your people? Who do you think
planted these guns?

515
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,840
You can come out.

516
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,080
How are you doing, Doc?

517
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,680
I'm having Sampson run the Narrows.

518
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,760
You know, you should've killed me
when you had the chance.

519
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,440
The fact that you didn't told me
everything I needed to know.

520
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,640
Since we're family,
I'm only going to do one hand.

521
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,880
Throw her on the streets.

522
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,680
Let the Narrows see their queen.

523
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,880
The scene here remains largely
under control.

524
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,200
But Ivy Pepper remains at large.

525
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,160
Now inside we have
a team of investigators...

526
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,480
Yeah.

527
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,600
What?

528
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,120
Where is she?

529
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,040
Sir?

530
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,880
Sir? Excuse me.

531
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Are you family?

532
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:21,960
I'm a cop.

533
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,920
She wouldn't tell us who did it.

534
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,160
She didn't have to.

535
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,600
Arkham doesn't get many volunteers.

536
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,200
You do know who I am, right?

537
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,800
Criminally insane pretty much
covers it.

538
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,440
Read and sign.

539
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,280
I'll be back.

540
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,680
Hate that you were right about this.

541
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,280
It'll keep her safe.

542
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:12,200
Hey, Ed.
What has two eyes but can't see?

543
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,520
This again.

544
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,280
Two needles.

545
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,440
Half of Mississippi, who cares.

546
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,400
You should, Ed.

547
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,880
I knew you'd come.

548
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:36,120
- I knew you'd understand my letter!
- How did you know I'd be?

549
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,120
- What are you talking about?
- I'm not talking to you, Ed.

550
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,200
I'm talking to him.

551
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,760
He read my letter!

552
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,360
Read the first word of each sentence.

553
00:38:55,080 --> 00:39:00,640
<i>"Please bring Ed to Arkham
so I can set you free."</i>

554
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,800
What has two eyes

555
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,960
but can't see what's happening
in front of him?

556
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,120
- Ed Nygma!
- No!

557
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,920
I came here to save Lee.

558
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,800
He read my letter!

559
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,880
You...

560
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:15,680
You're wrong! I am Ed!

561
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,840
Edward Nygma, that is it!

562
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,360
Lee believes in me!
She sees me for who I am!

563
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:23,240
But I see him, Ed!

564
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,320
No.

565
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:29,400
Lee Thompkins may have
made Ed strong...

566
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,000
but I see the other you.

567
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,000
One whose name I wouldn't speak.

568
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,560
But because he has earned it

569
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,680
and because I need him,

570
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,520
- I'm saying it now.
- No, please. Please, don't!

571
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,560
- I need you...
- Please.

572
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,240
Riddler.

573
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,520
Shall we get to work?

574
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,040
So...

575
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,040
how'd you make it off the roof then?

576
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,760
A fire escape on the next building.

577
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,360
Why'd you run from Gordon?

578
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,400
I mean, you could've told him
it's you.

579
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,120
I don't know.

580
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,960
I just...

581
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,600
couldn't.

582
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,360
I want to help people, Alfred.

583
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,960
And if that means accepting
every part of myself

584
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,240
the good and bad...

585
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,280
then I will.

586
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,840
I do.

587
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,320
It's what my parents would've wanted.

588
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,480
Your parents would have been
very proud of you.

589
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,880
I'm proud of you.

590
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,000
Alfred.

591
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,560
If you...

592
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,680
need a ride back to Gotham,
I can drive you.

593
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,400
I'm not going anywhere, sir.

594
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:43,840
I'm home.

595
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,720
Congratulations.

596
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,440
I heard you saved the day.

597
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,320
Good job.

598
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,600
It's the reason you're captain

599
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,560
and I'm a 50-year-old screw-up
pouring shots for barflies.

600
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:19,520
There's a reason, all right.
But it's not what you think.

601
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,920
I screwed up, Harv.

602
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,600
I screwed up bad.

603
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,440
And I'm gonna need your help
to make it right.

604
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,360
Sofia hired the Pyg...

605
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,520
and I knew.

606
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:39,880
I knew...

607
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,080
and I covered it up.

608
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,160
And now I'm gonna take her down.
