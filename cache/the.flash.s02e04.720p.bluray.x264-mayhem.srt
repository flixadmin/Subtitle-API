1
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:06,182
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:10,018
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

3
00:00:10,302 --> 00:00:13,146
but secretly, with the help of my friends
at S.T.A.R. Labs,

4
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:16,066
I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.

5
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:19,736
I hunted down the man who killed
my mother, but in doing so,

6
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:22,156
I opened up our world to new threats.

7
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:25,326
And I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

8
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,779
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,072
Previously on The Flash...

10
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,497
Iris' mom is alive.

11
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:35,248
And you thought you could pay me
to walk away from my own daughter?

12
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:37,170
Last time you walked away for free.

13
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:39,874
When you created the Singularity,
you also created a breach.

14
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:42,001
A portal, connecting our two Earths.

15
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:44,758
You really think he's just
bringing these guys here to kill me?

16
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:46,509
Zoom was obsessed with destroying me.

17
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,056
Now he wants to destroy you?

18
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:50,806
I'm starting to perceive things.

19
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:52,135
Horrible things.

20
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:55,188
We have to merge
the inner and outer event horizons,

21
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:56,857
by separating in the eye of it.

22
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,309
No!

23
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:03,110
Ronnie died saving me and I...
I'm so sorry.

24
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:04,565
No, no, no, no. Get back! Come here!

25
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:07,568
Professor Stein, can you hear me?

26
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:13,791
Everyone secretly thinks
they've figured out

27
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:16,119
what their life is gonna be like.

28
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:20,714
But what no one ever considers is
that life has its own plans for you,

29
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,416
whether you like them or not.

30
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:24,877
And so you're left with a choice.

31
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:29,465
You can either embrace the change
and move forward.

32
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:31,391
Or fight it,

33
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:32,718
and be left behind.

34
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,178
Dude!

35
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:36,271
I knew you could do it!

36
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:38,565
That was some touchdown, man.

37
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:39,937
You won us the game.

38
00:01:40,142 --> 00:01:41,234
Hey, nah, man.

39
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:42,812
We won us the game.

40
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,738
Hey, that's not what
the cheerleaders were saying.

41
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,531
Yeah? For real? All right.

42
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:47,984
Jefferson.

43
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:49,569
Great game.

44
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,073
Hey, thanks, coach.

45
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:52,780
I'm not the only one that noticed.

46
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,366
A lot of scouts in the stands tonight.

47
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:57,209
And after that touchdown,

48
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:58,748
they all pulled out their cell phones.

49
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,455
You're gonna get your pick
of colleges, son.

50
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,127
You really think so?

51
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,633
I know so.

52
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,381
You get home and celebrate with your mom.

53
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:22,109
Everybody, run!

54
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:31,784
Hey! Hey, come on, man. I got you!

55
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:36,073
We got to get inside the tunnel!

56
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,424
Hold him steady!

57
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:51,968
He's dropping out.

58
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,177
Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

59
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,387
Cisco, we're losing him!

60
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:55,801
Got it!

61
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,353
Dios mio. Thank God.

62
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:08,234
He's getting worse.

63
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:09,444
Look, I did what I could

64
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:12,655
to re-engineer Dr. Wells' original
stabilizer to quell the reaction,

65
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,577
but I don't know what
he used as a power source.

66
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:16,280
Best I could find
was the one from his wheelchair.

67
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,656
And how long will that last?

68
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:20,834
Well, that's the problem is we had
already used up most of its energy

69
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:22,202
trying to dampen the metas' powers

70
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:25,130
during our little rogue air trip
with Weather Wizard and company.

71
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:26,961
I think we got a few days, tops.

72
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,212
And he's stuck in bed?

73
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:31,219
Yeah. When he wakes up,
I'm gonna transfer the stabilizer to this.

74
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,047
Give him a power cane.
Get him moving.

75
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,382
We got to figure out a way to save him.

76
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,930
I think I might know how to do that.

77
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,353
When the Particle Accelerator exploded,

78
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,898
the dark matter that collided
with Professor Stein

79
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:44,600
fused with the Firestorm matrix

80
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:48,358
and altered the normal molecular processes
that occurs within his body.

81
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:51,026
Those highly-reactive molecules

82
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,484
needed something to bond
with in order to stabilize.

83
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:54,818
And that's where Ronnie came in.

84
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:58,747
Yes, and now that Ronnie is no longer
a part of Professor Stein...

85
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,369
Those molecules don't have anything
to bond to.

86
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:04,044
And the longer he goes without merging,
the more unstable he becomes.

87
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,496
Oh.

88
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:09,758
All right, so what do we do?

89
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,427
Find another participant.

90
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,550
Okay, cool. So how do we do that?

91
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:16,803
Are we just gonna make a Tinder app
for potential meta-humans?

92
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:19,726
'Cause I'm pretty sure merging with Stein
and randomly bursting into flames

93
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,428
sounds like the biggest
swipe-left of all time.

94
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,981
Even if we could find someone willing,

95
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:27,150
Stein can't just merge
with whoever he wants.

96
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,398
No, he can't.
But I have done some research,

97
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:33,278
and I found two potential candidates
that might be compatible with him.

98
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:35,067
They both were affected
by the dark matter.

99
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,572
And they were both admitted
to the hospital

100
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:39,121
showing symptoms of gene
rearrangement mutation.

101
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,909
And they both share the same blood type
as Professor Stein and Ronnie.

102
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,242
All right.

103
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:47,204
This is more than organ donation.

104
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:50,882
We'll need more than tissue typing
to see if their bodies are compatible.

105
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,926
If I can isolate the genetic locus
of the two candidates

106
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:57,097
and cross-reference it
with the mutations in Professor Stein,

107
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,891
I might be able to find a match,

108
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:01,635
and save his life.

109
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:05,181
What do you need to do that?

110
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,454
All right. Blood samples
from both potential candidates.

111
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,505
Damn! That was fast even for you.

112
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:33,925
I may have skipped
the asking-for-permission part.

113
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:35,756
Let's see if we can't find a match.

114
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,600
You were two in that picture.

115
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:44,890
You just got some shots.

116
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:47,223
You were so mad at the nurse.

117
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,728
Kept saying, "She pinched me."

118
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:52,607
So we took you to the park
afterwards to cheer you up.

119
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:55,485
Gave you your first ice cream cone,
which was a mistake,

120
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,487
because all we heard the next month was

121
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,194
"Mimp-choplat chip, mimp-choplat chip."

122
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:03,872
Oh. That's where the obsession started.

123
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:07,372
Baby, you don't have to do this.

124
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:10,416
If you don't want to meet
your mother tomorrow,

125
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,917
I get it.

126
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:13,923
No, it's okay.

127
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:15,671
I want to meet her.

128
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,594
I need to meet her.

129
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:21,173
It's gonna be fine.

130
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,177
My brave, baby girl.

131
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,807
Take after you.

132
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,438
Love you!

133
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:33,894
Love you more.

134
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:39,779
Barry?

135
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:41,656
Hey! I was just looking for you.

136
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,862
I would've called
but I don't have your number yet, so...

137
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,788
- Oh, yeah. You...
- No, no, no.

138
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:47,036
Uh, I just wanted to show you this.

139
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,538
These werejust found in an alley
off of Eastwood Avenue.

140
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:50,869
What are these? Teeth?

141
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,294
Shark teeth.

142
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:55,499
And I have an eyewitness
that says he saw a shark,

143
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:57,209
walking on land. A...

144
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,589
A man-shark.

145
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,295
- Man-shark?
- Yeah.

146
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:01,971
Sounds like a bad sci-fi movie.

147
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:03,465
Or awesome sci-fi movie.

148
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:05,259
Totally.

149
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:09,555
Um... What, are you for real?
You think there's actually, like, a...

150
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:12,895
Yeah, I mean, I...
I know it sounds really wack-o,

151
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:16,649
but, I mean, nothing seems impossible
now that we have meta-humans, right?

152
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:20,153
And lthought it would be fun, you know,
for us to work together again. On a case.

153
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:23,281
Yeah, I know. I mean, I really...
I'd love to work on anything with you.

154
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:28,290
It's just, you know,
meta-humans aren't really my thing.

155
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:31,581
Oh. Okay, yeah. That's fine.
I can handle it.

156
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,458
No... You... Look, um,

157
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:34,834
how about I Just... I'll run a test.

158
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:37,040
See where the teeth came from.

159
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:38,963
- That would be amazing.
- All right.

160
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,593
- Cool. Yeah. For sure.
- Thanks.

161
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,171
Detective Spivot.

162
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,554
Detective.

163
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:46,554
- How's your man-shark case coming?
- Lt's good.

164
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:49,060
I was just gonna go and canvass the area,
see what else I can dig up.

165
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,807
And Barry, here, agreed to run
some tests for me.

166
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:52,765
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

167
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:54,771
So, progress. Thanks again.

168
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,227
Mmm-hmm.

169
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,564
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say you were flirting with my partner.

170
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:02,445
What? Patty? No, I'm...

171
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,242
No, what are you
talking about? I'm not.

172
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:08,743
What is it with you, and Iris,
and my partners?

173
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,332
Hey, how is Iris, by the way?

174
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:14,704
She's pretty nervous about seeing
her mother after all these years.

175
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:16,205
Yeah.

176
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:17,793
Hey, you know what? I got to go.

177
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:19,750
It's Cisco. It's about Professor Stein.

178
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,252
Okay, go. I'll cover you with Singh.

179
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:22,961
All right. Thanks.

180
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,591
Well, I must admit,
I never imagined

181
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:32,020
a Sphinx's riddle about a man requiring
three legs would ever apply to me,

182
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:36,100
but if this device keeps me mobile,
then I will gratefully oblige.

183
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:39,026
Well, hopefully you won't need it
for much longer.

184
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:40,896
There was no agglutination
in the blood samples,

185
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:42,822
and cross-matching was negative for both.

186
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:46,118
And it appears that the dark matter
from the Particle Accelerator explosion

187
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:49,321
mutated their genes
in a very similar way it did to yours.

188
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,453
- I think they're both potential matches.
- So, who do we go with?

189
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:55,035
Well, my first choice is Henry Hewitt.

190
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:58,084
He graduated summa cum laude
from Hudson University,

191
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:00,962
with a double major
in Applied Physics and Bioengineering.

192
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,713
A Hudson boy. I like him already.

193
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:05,171
Now, what about this other guy?
Jefferson Jackson?

194
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:07,760
High School quarterback. 4.0 student.

195
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,217
He's got the physical attributes.

196
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,599
And it looks like more of his alleles
match than Hewitt's.

197
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:16,181
Doesn't that mean
that he's more compatible?

198
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:19,393
On paper, perhaps.
But Hewitt is a scientist.

199
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:21,854
Clearly, he's trying
to make something of his life.

200
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:24,190
I think he'd be open
to something like this.

201
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,820
I think we should meet with both of them
before we make a decision.

202
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:29,528
- That's an excellent idea.
- I'll see if I can get Hewitt here.

203
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,909
All right. In the meantime,
we'll go meet with Jefferson Jackson.

204
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:35,827
And I will try to find something else
to help keep you stable.

205
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,276
Are you sure this is the right place?

206
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,779
Yeah. Jefferson's a mechanic.

207
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:08,275
Could indicate a strong
technical aptitude.

208
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:09,735
That's a positive.

209
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,786
Oh. Prone to allergies.

210
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,951
That's definitely a negative.

211
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:16,617
Not to mention his taste in music.

212
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,331
Would you prefer Celine Dion instead?

213
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:21,538
I got the Titanic soundtrack
in the back there.

214
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,631
- No, thank you.
- Jefferson Jackson, right?

215
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:26,593
- People call me Jax.
- Ooh. Catchy.

216
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:30,047
I... Well, my name is Barry Allen,
and this is Martin Stein.

217
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:31,632
We're with the Department of Safety.

218
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,593
It's a small, newly formed agency.

219
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:37,896
Very new. We probably
don't even have a website yet. Do we?

220
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,102
You need to see our licenses?
I mean, we're all up to code here.

221
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:42,484
No. No, nothing like that.

222
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:45,107
We are compiling data on people

223
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,939
who were affected by the Particle
Accelerator explosion two years ago.

224
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:51,284
Look, man, I lost enough time in my life
'cause of that stupid thing going wrong.

225
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:53,403
Now, you don't got a car I can fix,
I can't help you.

226
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:56,330
If you would consider coming back
to S.T.A.R. Labs with us,

227
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:57,908
I believe we can help you.

228
00:10:58,366 --> 00:10:59,583
Help me, how?

229
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:02,958
Well, we know what
the Particle Accelerator did.

230
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:04,915
Look, I already told you,
I don't talk about that night.

231
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:06,170
Why is that?

232
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:09,048
Because that's when everything changed.
Look, lgot hit hard.

233
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:10,674
When I woke up, I was in the hospital.

234
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,381
Busted up leg, torn ACL.

235
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,140
The look on my mom's face.

236
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,763
I knew any dreams I had
of playing pro-ball were over.

237
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:18,561
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Yeah.

238
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,013
Well...

239
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,518
Look, I got to get back to work.

240
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,142
Yeah. Um...

241
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:25,856
Here, it's just...

242
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:28,230
It's our number.

243
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,982
Just think about it, okay?

244
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,048
Thank you for putting
this together, Joseph.

245
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:49,501
Iris' idea. Not mine.

246
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:54,681
- Hey, baby.
- Hi, Dad.

247
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,262
Iris.

248
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:03,348
This is Francine.

249
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,267
- Hello.
- Hi.

250
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,270
Hello, Iris.

251
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:13,070
Can I get you a coffee or something?

252
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,527
Um, no, thanks.

253
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:18,447
Let's just sit.

254
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:23,751
I can't get over what a beautiful,
young woman you've become.

255
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,704
And a journalist?

256
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,539
I'm so proud of you.

257
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:29,917
Why are you here?

258
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,002
Why now?

259
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,545
After two decades.

260
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,806
I want to make this right with you.

261
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:40,017
How about you start
by apologizing for walking out on us?

262
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,728
I am sorry.

263
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:44,560
So very, very sorry.

264
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,526
There's so much you don't know.

265
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:51,855
I'm sure that you've been through
a great deal.

266
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:56,117
And I can appreciate you feeling like
this is suddenly the right time

267
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:57,944
for you to want me in your life.

268
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:01,202
But that doesn't mean
that it's the right time for me.

269
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,617
- Iris?
- No, Dad, it's okay.

270
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,619
I've thought about this a lot.

271
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:07,996
And it wasn't fair
for me to make you the bad guy.

272
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:11,257
So, I want you to hear this from me.

273
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,503
I don't hate you, Francine.

274
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,887
I do wish you well.

275
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,513
But we have lived separate lives
for over 20 years.

276
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,303
Let's keep it that way.

277
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:36,024
I've always thought
my destiny was for greater things.

278
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,529
And people, of course.

279
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:38,826
Well, when it's all said and done,

280
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:42,406
flying will be the least impressive
of your new abilities.

281
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:46,038
Man finally achieves the promise
of the atomic age.

282
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:48,833
Caitlin? What's going on?

283
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:50,163
Hi, I'm glad you're back.

284
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,669
This is Dr. Henry Hewitt.

285
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:54,968
This is Barry Allen
and Professor Martin Stein.

286
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:57,678
- How do you do?
- The illustrious Martin Stein.

287
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:01,429
I've read all your papers back at Hudson,
especially on transmutation.

288
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:02,884
Fascinating.

289
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:04,685
You're a legend.

290
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:07,810
Oh, please. You're over estimating
my contribution to the field. I...

291
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,189
Isn't he great?

292
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:13,065
Yeah. He's got an ego the size of Texas,
but, yeah, he's all right.

293
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:15,530
So, where's Jefferson Jackson?

294
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:18,153
- We just need more time.
- We don't have more time.

295
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:19,610
I couldn't find another power source
for the cane.

296
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:20,823
And that thing's running out.

297
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:23,113
Okay. Then let's do the merge.
Hewitt's in.

298
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,498
What do you mean? You told him the details
of the Firestorm Matrix?

299
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,954
Absolutely. Becoming Firestorm
is a huge life change.

300
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,536
He needs to know
what he's getting himself into.

301
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:33,089
If I remember correctly,
vector, variance, hypotenuse...

302
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:36,338
- Proton, neutron, Go HU!
- Yes!

303
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:39,512
Look at that, that's so cute. We'll have
two Professor Steins if this works.

304
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:41,631
- It's gonna work.
- Yeah?

305
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:43,759
Okay.

306
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:47,266
When I put this splicer on your chest,
you're gonna feel a rush.

307
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,772
That's a molecular primer
being released into your body.

308
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,896
Then, you can make physical contact
with Professor Stein,

309
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,645
and Firestorm Matrix will take over.

310
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,105
Easy enough.

311
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:59,407
- Ready?
- No time like the present.

312
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,484
- Thank you, my dear.
- Okay.

313
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:21,213
Try again.

314
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,561
This is unexpected.

315
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,523
Something's supposed to be happening,
right?

316
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:43,985
- Why isn't it working?
- I don't know.

317
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:49,495
Well, looks like you two
aren't compatible after all.

318
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:50,951
I'm just gonna...

319
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,328
So, all this was for nothing.

320
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:55,792
Believe me.

321
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:57,840
No one is more disappointed than I am.

322
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,334
Yeah, don't be so sure about that.

323
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:01,795
Next time,

324
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:06,094
try to get your act together
before you get someone's hopes up.

325
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:30,995
Move the show-and-tell
to next Tuesday.

326
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:33,376
Remind me to call Richard tomorrow
about the shareholders meeting.

327
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:36,037
And where are we with the replacement
for Dr. Snow?

328
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:37,956
We...

329
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,379
Applied sciences?

330
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,225
Stop! Don't move!

331
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,268
Harrison?

332
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,116
Detective West.
Thank you for coming.

333
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,744
Dr. McGee, this is my new partner,
Detective Spivot.

334
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:10,197
It's nice to meet you.

335
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,414
I was saddened
by Detective Thawne's passing.

336
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:14,659
Please extend my condolences
to your daughter.

337
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:15,914
Thank you.

338
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:18,956
On the phone you mentioned
this was a sensitive matter.

339
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,506
It is. And I called you directly

340
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:24,006
because I've always appreciated
your discretion in the past.

341
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,212
Of course.
Can you tell me what was stolen?

342
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,014
It's not so much what was stolen,
but who stole it.

343
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:31,517
The person who broke into
my facility last night

344
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:33,682
was Harrison Wells.

345
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:37,106
Harrison Wells is dead.

346
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,100
I seem to recall the circumstances

347
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,276
around his passing
were a bit inconclusive.

348
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,525
Is there any possibility
he could be alive?

349
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:44,981
Zero possibility.

350
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:46,775
I knew the man for over 20 years.

351
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:48,576
I know who I saw.

352
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,953
The only thing distinctively different was

353
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,448
he's walking again.

354
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,827
Like I said, I trust your discretion.

355
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:00,288
You have full access to the facility.

356
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,457
Thank you again, Detective.

357
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:08,638
First a shark-man, now a dead man walking.

358
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:12,266
We need to call Barry,
get him in here first.

359
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,969
Barry can't hear about any of this.

360
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,180
What? Why?

361
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:18,435
Because he's got a lot on his plate.

362
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,107
He's got a friend who's sick,
who needs his help.

363
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:22,857
And Harrison Wells is the man
who murdered his mother.

364
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,858
Once he hears that...

365
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:27,490
- Is he okay?
- He's fine,

366
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:30,493
but not a word to him, or anyone. Okay?

367
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:31,990
Okay.

368
00:18:32,153 --> 00:18:33,655
Yeah, it's just...

369
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:35,998
I'm not really good at lying.

370
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:37,951
Well, you better learn. Quick.

371
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:40,666
Yeah, definitely.

372
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:52,515
- Spivot, go on ahead.
- Sure.

373
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,890
This is the last time you ever
show up here. Do you understand?

374
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,141
I needed to talk to you again.

375
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:00,849
How much clearer do we need to be?

376
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:03,142
Iris and I do not want you in our lives.

377
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:04,978
Leave. Please.

378
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:07,780
Go home, live your life.

379
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,074
Joe, there's something else.

380
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:12,201
I wanted to tell you
when I first saw you, but...

381
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:13,778
What is it?

382
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:18,658
A few months ago,

383
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:20,710
I started getting weak.

384
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:23,625
The doctors ran a bunch of tests,
they couldn't figure it out.

385
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:27,049
But finally, they did.

386
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:30,215
Said I have something called MacGregor's.

387
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,674
Supposedly, it's pretty common
among ex-addicts.

388
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:40,055
Told me I had till the end of the year,
if I'm lucky.

389
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:44,521
Is... Is that why you came back?

390
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:47,312
I just want my daughter to know me.

391
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:49,648
This me.

392
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:00,541
I'm really glad
you decided to come.

393
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:03,248
I thought S.T.A.R. Labs had to shut down.

394
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,124
It's under new management.

395
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:08,420
Whoa, what kind of treadmill is that?

396
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:09,918
Cosmic.

397
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:11,920
Cool.

398
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,638
So, let's get started.

399
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:18,179
You got some kind of Billion-Dollar-Man
technology that's gonna fix my knee?

400
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:21,391
Actually, Jax,
this isn't about fixing your knee.

401
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:23,018
What are you talking about?

402
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,145
When the Particle Accelerator exploded,

403
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:29,274
the energy wave that collided with you
is known as dark matter.

404
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:31,823
And, it didn't just hurt your knee.

405
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:35,617
It changed the molecular structure
of your body.

406
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:36,990
Whoa, hold on, Grey.

407
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:38,871
So, you're saying I'm like
one of those meta-humans

408
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,698
I keep hearing about on the news?

409
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,876
Yes, I am. Please, call me Professor.

410
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,374
We think you have potential capabilities.

411
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:47,876
What kind of capabilities?

412
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,503
The same as Professor Stein.

413
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:54,303
The ability for your body
to process fission and fusion.

414
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,551
And you can harness excess energy

415
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:59,134
and turn it into these
massive nuclear blasts.

416
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:01,936
And you can fly. There's also that.

417
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,680
So you're saying you can do all this?

418
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:08,985
Only during times of convergence
with a willing partner.

419
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:11,730
Convergence? You and me?

420
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,189
Yes.

421
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:17,864
No. This is crazy.

422
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:21,372
Jax, this is your chance to right
the wrong that was done to you.

423
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:23,324
Yeah. Sorry, you got the wrong guy.

424
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:24,704
I don't want nothing to do with this.

425
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:27,788
Wait a second. We are giving you
the chance to be a superhero,

426
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,212
and you're going to say no that quickly?

427
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:30,585
Yeah. Not my kind of thing.

428
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:33,384
If the man isn't willing to participate...

429
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:35,382
Look, I saw your test scores, Jax.

430
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:38,806
Your grades were good enough
to get into college, but you didn't go.

431
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,303
Why?

432
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:42,935
Is this the type of guy you are?
One setback and you fold?

433
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,762
Well then, maybe you're not
the guy for us anyway.

434
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,017
Well, maybe I'm not.

435
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,432
Jack...

436
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,856
Maybe, this just wasn't meant to be.

437
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,528
Caitlin, what do you... I mean,

438
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:00,862
Jax could be our last chance
at saving Professor Stein.

439
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:04,119
He said "no" to being a superhero.
Who does that?

440
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,950
I mean, you didn't say no
when you had the chance.

441
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,752
- Cisco, would you?
- Chance to have superpowers?

442
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:10,045
Sign me up.

443
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:12,795
Look, we're asking Jax
to change his entire life.

444
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,750
To sacrifice what he does have.

445
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:17,712
I mean, that's not a decision
that can be made lightly.

446
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:21,766
It took me a long time
to figure out this whole hero thing.

447
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:25,140
Exactly. Which is why we need someone
who wants to do this.

448
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,556
- Where are you going?
- To get Hewitt back.

449
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,357
We have to try again.

450
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:39,692
Human DNA?

451
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,198
Yep. Definitely not a man-shark.

452
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:43,746
Not even a land shark, ma'am.

453
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:45,493
Well, thanks for testing it for me.

454
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:47,325
Yeah. What are you gonna do now?

455
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:49,827
I don't know. Probably file it
under never-gonna-happen.

456
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,378
- I have another case, anyway.
- Oh.

457
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:52,831
Anything I can help you with?

458
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:55,541
No. No, no, no.
Detective said definitely not.

459
00:22:56,584 --> 00:22:58,837
- Is everything all good?
- Sure. Why?

460
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,172
I don't know.
You're just acting kind of different.

461
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,427
No!

462
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:05,594
No, I'm the same old P. Spivot.

463
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:07,095
You know?

464
00:23:07,678 --> 00:23:09,305
What... Actually, I have to go.

465
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:12,892
But thank you so much for testing this.
And I'll see you.

466
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,352
Okay. I...

467
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:24,988
Yo, Joe.

468
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:27,493
Hey.

469
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:30,664
You good? Everything all right?

470
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:33,412
Yeah. I don't know.

471
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:35,839
- I just had a hell of a day.
- Yeah?

472
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:40,094
Iris' mother.

473
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:43,006
She told me she was dying.

474
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,846
Yeah. And I know Francine.

475
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:49,349
She's telling the truth about this.

476
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:50,895
Okay.

477
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,349
Does Iris know?

478
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,192
Not yet.

479
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:59,442
Did... Did you need something?

480
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:02,111
Uh, no. Nah, I Just...

481
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:07,038
Patty said that you don't want me on
some case that she's on with you.

482
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:08,781
No.

483
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:11,459
I was checking out a lead.
I'll let you know.

484
00:24:12,368 --> 00:24:13,961
All right. Cool.

485
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,421
What is up with you and my partner anyway?

486
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:19,090
- Come on. I...
- Barr,

487
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:20,968
you can't take your eyes off that girl.

488
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,720
I don't know what you want me to tell you.

489
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:25,215
I mean, she's great, you know.

490
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:29,887
She's adorable and funny,
and we have a lot in common. But...

491
00:24:30,094 --> 00:24:31,562
But, um...

492
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:36,567
I don't know. She's not Iris, I guess.

493
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:38,061
Right.

494
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:41,317
You've known Iris since you were 10,

495
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:45,743
you've been in love with her
since forever.

496
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:48,746
I mean, you two are friends now,

497
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:50,990
but she was your first love.

498
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:55,461
You're never gonna feel the same
about anybody else.

499
00:24:57,287 --> 00:25:01,758
But you can't let that stop you
from exploring something new.

500
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:04,921
Yeah.

501
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:09,517
And in happier news,
remember Flash Day,

502
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:13,683
the downtown celebration to honor
Central City's one and only superhero?

503
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,272
Well, just weeks...

504
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:18,267
Hewitt. You have those nucleosome results?

505
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:21,438
- Tomorrow.
- I told you I needed them tonight.

506
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:24,615
And I'm telling you,
you'll have them tomorrow!

507
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:28,035
You know, I... I know you think
you're smarter than everyone here, Hewitt,

508
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:30,951
but I'm sick of you not doing your job,
your not showing up.

509
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:34,283
If I have any more trouble from you,
you're done here.

510
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:37,495
What? You're going to take the test away
and give it to another lab rat of yours?

511
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,288
You gonna report me to the board?

512
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:41,043
Or maybe you're thinking of firing me?

513
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:42,633
I'd like to see you try!

514
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,634
Now, get the hell out of my lab!

515
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:58,149
What's being described
as a "spontaneous energy malfunction"

516
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:01,151
erupted last night
at Eikmeier Technologies.

517
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:04,154
Wanted for questioning is scientist,
Henry Hewitt.

518
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,484
Hewitt's dormant abilities must have been
triggered when we attempted the merger.

519
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,568
This could be catastrophic.

520
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:11,202
If his powers are anything like mine,

521
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:16,534
he requires a grounding mechanism
to stabilize his volatility. Otherwise...

522
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:18,161
Yeah. He's gonna pop his top.

523
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:20,830
And he's got a long history of violence,
according to his police record.

524
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,043
Police record?

525
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:23,708
- I didn't find a police record.
- Yeah, of course not.

526
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:25,168
It was sealed. But guess what?

527
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:27,177
Your boy hacked in and...

528
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:29,012
Hold on. Wait for it.

529
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,594
One count battery,
two counts aggravated assault,

530
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,433
court ordered anger management therapy.

531
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:34,892
He seemed like such a nice guy.

532
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:37,722
He even knew your Hudson nerd song!

533
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:40,186
You okay?

534
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:45,196
It appears Mr. Hewitt's stability
isn't the only one in question.

535
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:47,193
I think I need to lie down.

536
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,567
- Yeah, I'll come with you.
- Thank you.

537
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:53,700
Professor Stein is getting worse.

538
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:56,623
And Hewitt's like this because of me.

539
00:26:56,865 --> 00:27:00,369
And now, Jefferson Jackson will never
come back because of what I said.

540
00:27:01,912 --> 00:27:05,132
I just didn't believe
that he has what it takes.

541
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,923
This isn't because
you didn't believe in him.

542
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:15,642
Sometimes, great possibilities
are right in front of us,

543
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:18,103
and we don't see them
because we choose not to.

544
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:24,394
I think that we need to be open
to exploring something new.

545
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:34,779
She's dying?

546
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:38,244
A few months left.

547
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:41,243
I just don't think I can see her, Dad.

548
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:42,915
And that's fine.

549
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:44,246
But

550
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:46,752
you and me need to be
crystal clear about this, Iris.

551
00:27:46,957 --> 00:27:50,006
If you want to have a relationship
with Francine, it's okay with me.

552
00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:51,299
You don't have to protect me.

553
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:54,427
I'm a grown man, and I've dealt
with these feelings a long time ago.

554
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,933
So, you... You just believe her?

555
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:04,267
She's done some bad things in her life,
but she wouldn't lie about this.

556
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:06,811
Dad, she shows up out of nowhere,

557
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:10,273
and she only says that she's dying
after I told her to stay away?

558
00:28:11,148 --> 00:28:14,118
Look, she didn't come to Central City
to see me.

559
00:28:14,318 --> 00:28:15,615
She came because of you.

560
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:17,446
I just wanted you to know everything

561
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:19,286
so you can make
the best decision for yourself.

562
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:21,792
I mean, she is still your mother.

563
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:25,166
Either way, whatever you decide, just know

564
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:27,338
I got your back.

565
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:30,508
I know.

566
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:42,639
Let me guess.
You don't got car troubles.

567
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:44,644
I came to apologize.

568
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:46,316
I'm sorry for what I said.

569
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:48,852
It's fine. Apology accepted.

570
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:51,738
Look, we could really use your help
to save Professor Stein.

571
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,324
- That desperate, huh?
- Yes.

572
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:58,245
My husband, Ronnie,

573
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:01,828
he used to be
Professor Stein's other half.

574
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:05,411
He actually helped to build
the Particle Accelerator,

575
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:09,336
and when it exploded,
he was affected by it, too.

576
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:14,344
Ironically, that's how he got the chance
to show the world

577
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:17,848
what he was truly capable of.

578
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,347
And he died saving this city.

579
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:24,346
Wait. He was the guy
that flew into the black hole?

580
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,523
That was him?

581
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,233
He was a hero.

582
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:30,019
You can be one, too.

583
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:31,774
I never wanted to be a hero.

584
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,739
What I wanted was to go to college,
and we couldn't afford it.

585
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,944
Football was my way in
until that got taken from me.

586
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:39,410
I know.

587
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:42,619
Look, I know the Particle Accelerator took
something from you,

588
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:45,367
but it also gave you something in return.

589
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:48,628
Something even more spectacular.

590
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:52,216
The opportunity to be part
of something bigger,

591
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:55,044
to be part of a team
that's working to protect

592
00:29:55,252 --> 00:29:57,380
people from losing what you lost.

593
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:02,051
I believe you were meant to be a hero.

594
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:08,395
Whoa, hold on.

595
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:12,732
- I've been looking for you, Dr. Snow.
- Hey, look man, we're...

596
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:21,737
You did this to me!

597
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:24,411
But it's not what you promised!

598
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:25,911
Is it?

599
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:28,292
Is it?

600
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:33,464
Come on!

601
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,632
- Where to?
- S.T.A.R. Labs.

602
00:30:57,314 --> 00:30:58,361
Caitlin.

603
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,321
- What's wrong?
- Come here.

604
00:31:01,151 --> 00:31:02,277
Good, you're here.

605
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:03,946
This thing, it ran out,
like, 30 minutes ago.

606
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:06,953
His temperature is 142 degrees
and rising fast.

607
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:09,459
He's going into rapid oxidation.
We need to find a coolant.

608
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:11,791
Yeah, I think it's too late for that.

609
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:13,956
I'll do it.

610
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:15,791
I'll merge with him.

611
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:19,469
You said this is a chance for me to be
a part of something bigger than myself,

612
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:21,012
to help people.

613
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:23,640
- That's what I want.
- You're sure?

614
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:26,309
Once you merge,
there's no going back on this.

615
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:28,849
And you said I could fly, right?

616
00:31:29,096 --> 00:31:30,814
- Damn right.
- Okay.

617
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:32,144
So what do I do?

618
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:34,147
Okay. Well, here's the abridged version.

619
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:35,481
Professor Stein.

620
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:36,941
- What?
- Professor Stein.

621
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,488
Clarissa, five more minutes.

622
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:42,026
No. Professor, you have to get up.
Jax is here.

623
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:43,492
- What?
- Jax is here.

624
00:31:43,652 --> 00:31:44,653
Here, grab onto me.

625
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,117
- Jax...
- Yeah.

626
00:31:48,782 --> 00:31:50,125
This is it.

627
00:32:00,377 --> 00:32:02,505
You came back, Jefferson. Thank you.

628
00:32:02,963 --> 00:32:06,012
Well, like my coach always said,
"Out of yourself and into the team."

629
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,347
So, how's this work?

630
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:10,520
Okay. All you're gonna do is touch him.

631
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:12,889
- And then what happens?
- You become Firestorm.

632
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:14,565
Okay.

633
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:31,996
Jax?

634
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:37,331
Is Professor Stein...

635
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:38,665
How will I know?

636
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:40,922
Hello, Jefferson. Now, you know.

637
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:43,382
Oh, so I get Grey as my co-pilot.

638
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:45,923
Did no one ever inform you
of that fringe benefit?

639
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:49,101
So when do we get to take this
for a test spin?

640
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,392
Uh, how about now?

641
00:32:53,597 --> 00:32:54,894
It looks like Hewitt's recharging

642
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,899
at Central City High School's
football stadium.

643
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:00,236
Wait. That was where I got hurt.

644
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:18,918
Cisco!

645
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,299
Cut the power to the field,
so he can't draw any more energy.

646
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:23,381
I'm on it. Stand by.

647
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:28,139
Booyaka!

648
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:35,976
Hewitt!

649
00:33:36,223 --> 00:33:37,816
You need to stop!

650
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:39,734
This is not who you are!

651
00:33:42,646 --> 00:33:43,772
Stein?

652
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,607
You chose him over me?

653
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:48,652
That's who I'm supposed to be!

654
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:52,076
I deserve the Firestorm Matrix!

655
00:33:52,948 --> 00:33:54,245
Now!

656
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:56,456
Calm down, Jefferson.

657
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:57,786
Focus.

658
00:33:57,953 --> 00:34:00,752
Use your natural athleticism
to gain control.

659
00:34:05,085 --> 00:34:06,302
Hey, you okay?

660
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:08,805
I was a quarterback.
I know how to take a hit.

661
00:34:09,506 --> 00:34:11,429
Hey, guys, cutting the power didn't work.

662
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:13,806
It's like the more we anger him,
the stronger he gets!

663
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:17,314
That's it. It's like one of those, uh,
controlled fusion devices.

664
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:19,646
- A tokamak?
- Yes, exactly!

665
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:22,352
And the more powerful they become,
the more unstable they become.

666
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:25,321
Barry, make him angry
and he'll blow his fuse.

667
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:28,780
You up for a little game
of "catch me if you can"?

668
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:30,201
Let's go for it.

669
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:42,163
Hey, Hewitt! Over here.

670
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:46,005
Paging Dr. Hewitt.

671
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:48,170
Boo!

672
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:52,219
Man, you are not good at this.

673
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:54,642
You need a hug, Doctor?

674
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,649
Come on, Hewitt!
Give me your best shot!

675
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:03,067
Now!

676
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:09,866
Is that all you got, Hewitt?

677
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:12,194
Man, no wonder you didn't make the cut
if that's how you fight.

678
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,838
Not bad for your first go at this.

679
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:32,593
Well, I had a great coach
to help me through it.

680
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:34,428
Isn't that right, Grey?

681
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:38,721
Despite my initial reservations,
we make a pretty fantastic team.

682
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:41,389
Welcome aboard, Firestorm.

683
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:00,204
Hi.

684
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:04,420
Thank you for coming.

685
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:07,882
You have no idea what this means to me.

686
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:10,427
My dad told me you were sick.

687
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,923
You know, I wasn't sure
that I could believe you,

688
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,887
so I did some checking.

689
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:20,471
Turns out you're telling the truth.

690
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,644
I would never lie to you
about something so big.

691
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:25,562
Really?

692
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:29,817
'Cause I was actually thinking
that I could give you another chance

693
00:36:30,063 --> 00:36:31,280
after hearing that news.

694
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:35,777
But you are still lying.

695
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:38,120
Still keeping secrets.

696
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:42,659
I am an investigative reporter, Francine.

697
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:46,004
I uncover things
that people want to keep hidden.

698
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:48,457
Like having a son.

699
00:36:48,832 --> 00:36:49,924
Iris...

700
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:52,423
He was born eight months
after you left Central City.

701
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:55,631
- Let me explain.
- Who's the father, Francine?

702
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:57,594
Is it my dad?

703
00:36:59,968 --> 00:37:01,185
Do I have a brother?

704
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:06,315
Wait, you know what, I don't...
I don't even want to know.

705
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,148
I mean, I wouldn't be able to tell
if you were telling the truth

706
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,153
or if it was another one
of your lies, anyway.

707
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:15,279
I want you to leave.

708
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:19,158
You stay away from me,
and you stay away from my father.

709
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:23,162
If he finds out that he might have a son
that grew up without knowing him,

710
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:25,122
It would crush him.

711
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:27,291
Just...

712
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:30,165
Leave us alone.

713
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:32,717
Iris. Iris.

714
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:39,845
And how is Mr. Hewitt?

715
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:42,557
Seems like that last burst of energy
has burnt him out.

716
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:44,349
Our tokamak's gone dark.

717
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:47,228
Hey, we'rejust gonna keep him
safe and sound in the pipeline

718
00:37:47,474 --> 00:37:49,351
till he decides to keep quiet
about all this.

719
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:50,985
So you're gonna meet up with Clarissa?

720
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:52,688
We're meeting in Pittsburgh in three days.

721
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:54,026
Why Pittsburgh?

722
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:57,864
A colleague of mine was monumental
in helping train Ronald and me.

723
00:37:58,067 --> 00:38:00,035
She's graciously offered
to help the two of us as well.

724
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:01,533
Well, how is she going to help us?

725
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:03,539
Well, there were many aspects
of our abilities

726
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,538
that we never quite achieved.

727
00:38:05,742 --> 00:38:09,372
Hopefully now,
we can fully realize that potential.

728
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:13,004
My dearest Dr. Snow.

729
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:21,342
Ronald may be lost to us,

730
00:38:21,925 --> 00:38:23,222
but he will never be forgotten.

731
00:38:25,929 --> 00:38:27,397
Speaking of,

732
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:30,391
This was Ronnie's.

733
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:33,520
He always used it
to find his way back home.

734
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:35,070
I want you to have it.

735
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:40,405
Thank you.

736
00:38:41,611 --> 00:38:43,238
You know, this whole thing is strange.

737
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:44,906
Being 50% of someone.

738
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,413
Yeah, but you're 100% a hero.

739
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:51,963
I went ahead
and re-calibrated the splicer,

740
00:38:52,205 --> 00:38:53,923
so the merging should be
even smoother now.

741
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:55,129
Thank you.

742
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:58,135
If I may offer you a bit
of parting advice.

743
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:02,048
Cisco, I know you're scared,

744
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:05,764
but this ability you have is a gift.

745
00:39:05,969 --> 00:39:09,394
Not a curse. It's natural to be
apprehensive about the unknown.

746
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:10,936
But look, look at Jefferson.

747
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:15,111
He took a leap,
and it changed his life for the better.

748
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:21,443
The very thing that makes you different
is what makes you special.

749
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:25,284
Tell your friends.

750
00:39:31,244 --> 00:39:34,293
And now, I believe it's time to
take this show on the road,

751
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:36,633
or to the sky, if I'm to be literal.

752
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:46,767
Are you ready, Jefferson?

753
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:06,913
- All right. Yeah.
- See you later.

754
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10,458
That was one hell of a leap of faith
that kid took,

755
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:12,160
merging with Professor Stein.

756
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,502
Yeah, it was.

757
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:16,335
There is a lesson in there
somewhere for you.

758
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:20,669
Things aren't always
what they seem.

759
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,678
Our fears can play tricks on us.

760
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:26,341
Making us afraid to change course,
afraid to move on.

761
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:31,688
But usually, hidden behind our fears
are second chances waiting to be seized.

762
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:38,020
Second chances at life.

763
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:46,198
- Whoo!
- At glory.

764
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:48,197
Whoo!

765
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:52,200
At family.

766
00:40:58,331 --> 00:40:59,548
At love.

767
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,378
And these opportunities
don't come around every day.

768
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:05,888
So when they do, we have to be brave.

769
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:09,051
Take a chance,
and grab them while we can.

770
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:14,230
Zoom wants you dead.

771
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,569
Oh, my God, it's real!

772
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:26,159
Hey! Put him down!

773
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:28,737
Put your hands-Your fins in the air!

774
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,592
Who the hell are you?
