1
00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:07.580
How does it actually happen to you this
Party stuff has become so important?

2
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.220
Are you joining SING on Friday?

3
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.380
-That's going to be real.
-Sing?

4
00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.860
Take a look at the event, Sara
On our bus page.

5
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.840
-What is with the contract for the bus?
-I really do not want to leave you.

6
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.500
All right.

7
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,340
I do not know anybody,
Who is as muslim as Yousef.

8th
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.420
-Yes, but he does not believe in Allah.
-What is the most important thing?

9
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.860
To say that one believes in Allah
Or to live like you would?

10
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,420
-Elias! Stop!
-Disappears!

11
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.340
Sara had really panicked,
Because Sana probably had noticed.

12
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.100
I do not understand why she is at all
Where the bus took part.

13
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,360
Is not that quite disrespectful
Against religion?

14
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,560
(Sana praises in a whisper)

15
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,200
If you pour acid into your face,
If you do not wear a headscarf?

16
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:28,800
Sana you are circumcised

17
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,600
Hope you will be forced to marry after
Africa, then I am rid of you

18
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,600
... I'll tear you down!
... this shit

19
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:43,200
... forced to marry ...

20
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,000
...Africa...

21
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:48,800
... pull it down ...

22
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:50,600
...Headscarf...

23
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:51,500
... pull it down ...

24
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,000
...Headscarf...

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
<B> Monday </ b>

26
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:21,400
Hello Jamilla

27
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,500
(Jamilla :) -Whats the hell do you drive?
(Sana :) - SORRY !!

28
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,000
That was a misunderstanding! I thought,
You would have shit about me posted !!

29
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,100
I can explain it!
Call at once!

30
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,500
(Jamilla :) I'm just trying,
Protect you.

31
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,600
(Sana :) Thank you, that is not necessary.

32
00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.100
Do not talk to me,
Do not talk to me, no.

33
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,500
Do not talk to me,
Do not talk to me, no.

34
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,700
No no.

35
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,220
Do not talk to me,
Set my phone on silently.

36
00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.740
Do not talk to me, no. I am
Timeless, about me like night and day.

37
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:33,300
I know they know this bitch guy
Is crazy (crazy, crazy ...).

38
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,220
This bitch type is crazy.
Do not talk to me, no.

39
00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:43.380
You know me, no. Do not speak
With me, no. I do not want to know you.

40
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.420
I know you like it,
If I retain everything.

41
00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.640
Always call me at night,
I do not want to talk.

42
00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.740
What's this?

43
00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.220
-I've logged off from the bus.
-What ?!

44
00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.940
-I'm not there.
- Now, where we got a bus-

45
00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:32.100
-and people and everything runs,
Do you report?

46
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.540
What's happening?

47
00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.620
It just does not matter to me,
To be part of the Abi move.

48
00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:44.760
It was you
But still quite important?

49
00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.900
Maybe I noticed that it was all
Contrary to my values,

50
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:56,200
-like girls their entire self-respect
For a fuck in the forest sacrifice?

51
00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:24.820
- How's yours?
-Good. Everything OK.

52
00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.900
-Sorry again, that my brother ...
-No, that ... Do not think about it anymore.

53
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:34,740
Okay, folks, we've got a lot going on.
Next week we will write the exam.

54
00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:40.300
With some of you it does not look
Well, so watch out now.

55
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:46,340
-That is true for me.
-We are now going to the chapter ..

56
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.300
Can you help me, Sana?

57
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,700
I'm full of ass.
I totally depend on it.

58
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,300
Sorry. You must be the hard one
To look truth in the face.

59
00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.740
That I only get a 3?

60
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,900
That you are alone.

61
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,800
Please hit page ...

62
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,400
<B> Tuesday </ b>

63
00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:18.820
I do not want to drive it anymore.
Today he has stopped again.

64
00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.500
-Hello.
-Hi!

65
00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:26.060
-Is the food ready soon?
-Not quite yet.

66
00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.160
But you can have a carrot
If you like.

67
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,400
No thanks.

68
00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:42.900
-What the guys are always here?
-We are now hospitable.

69
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,540
They are always here.

70
00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.460
All are welcome.

71
00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:54.140
-Your girlfriends. The guys are okay.
(Noora :) -Welcome to meet?

72
00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.880
Why are you interested in this?

73
00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:04.040
Sana? Do you have today
A bad day

74
00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:07.300
I'll write next week
An organic exam.

75
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:13,400
But you're good at it.
Where is the problem?

76
00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:22.020
Well, if I do one day
As you want to be a surgeon,

77
00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.420
I use good grades.

78
00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:29.540
You can do it.
You can do it, I promise you.

79
00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:34.880
You have better notes
Than I had. It will.

80
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,960
-This car really annoys me.
-I can understand that.

81
00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:59.120
How is Jamilla?

82
00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.100
She's fine.

83
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,620
Nice to ask you. She is doing now
An education to the nurse.

84
00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:10.380
I think she likes it very well.

85
00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:13.680
(Notification)

86
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:16,400
(Noora :) Something wrong?
Are you so quiet

87
00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:19.960
(They talk about each other)

88
00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:24.140
- That's the guys!
-I'm fine?

89
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,020
Yes. And even?

90
00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:31.740
-Now everything is good; You are together
-As always.

91
00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:36.740
-And what's up"?
-We want to go to the football field.

92
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:44,720
Soccer? Do not forget the bottle.
The water bottle, I mean.

93
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:49,220
The bottle! Yes / Yes!

94
00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:52.260
-Behave!
-Yes, of course.

95
00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:57.820
- Are not you with us?
- I'm not so hungry.

96
00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:02.500
- Do you have carrots?
-Yes. We'll take it.

97
00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:05.840
Serve you.

98
00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:14.580
-Good, we have to go.
-Take care. Have fun!

99
00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.500
-Likewise!
-Tschüs.

100
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,780
Thanks for the carrot.
Thank you for being here.

101
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,080
Bye.

102
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,820
Then we agree,
That we buy a new one?

103
00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:34.600
-Yes, but we have to plan that.
-We need a new one. Very easily.

104
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,200
I am only stressed because of the exam

105
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,700
(Noora :) I'm also on the bus
deregistered. Do not carry it without you

106
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
<B> Wednesday </ b>

107
00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:09.100
I wanted to write a gloss,
But I'm not at all funny.

108
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,100
- I do not even know what a gloss is.
- That was really bad.

109
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:19,860
How should I be in a good mood,
When we write an exam?

110
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:23,280
(Loud noises from carrot chewing)

111
00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:27.460
Are you coming with me?

112
00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.960
Sana!

113
00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:36.500
-Hä?
- Are you coming to Mäckes?

114
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,100
-No, I'm learning for the exam.
-OK.

115
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,800
Shall we bring you something?

116
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,960
No thanks.

117
00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:53.520
-See you!
-Tschüs.

118
00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:39.860
- Did Sara pimp your girlfriends?
-Hä? No!

119
00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:43.200
OK. It was just a joke.

120
00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:57.100
Fake, fake, fake, fake ...

121
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,620
Girls ...!

122
00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:02.760
Sara does not like Vilde!

123
00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:10.940
-How do you know?
-Because she talks badly about her.

124
00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:14.200
-Towards you?
-mm.

125
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,920
-Are you friends with Sara?
-We were once a couple.

126
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,400
That's right.

127
00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:37.300
How can you be with
You be together?

128
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,020
What you do not say...

129
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,660
That was certain
No sexual relationship.

130
00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:48.760
We were mainly chatting.

131
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:57,000
I was more of a network psychologist
As a lover.

132
00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:02.860
I should have paid the time
Which I have spent with it,

133
00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:09.420
- assassinations about her
Abi bus friends and so on.

134
00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:13.280
It was shitty to me!

135
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:22,000
Hey! Sister types are species,
Which are determined only morphologically?

136
00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:26.860
No. Sister types are species,
Which are similar in appearance,

137
00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:30.740
-aber genetically complete
Can be different.

138
00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:34.520
I'm going to hang out.

139
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,600
<B> Thursday </ b>

140
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,525
(Jamilla) A good advice:Take it
William and Co from my class in eight!

141
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,600
(Sana :) Thank you. You were
My angel in the eighth.

142
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,700
Hopefully I will not land
Again in a racist class.

143
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,600
(Jamilla):-You are going to the nits now?
(Sana :) -Ja! Will be great but exhausting.

144
00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:03.200
(Sana :) Do not know anyone but you.
Nice to have someone there.

145
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,900
(Jamilla :) I'll be around you
To take care of. Just like on the Urra school.

146
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,200
SARA - the perfect bus boss

147
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,100
(Sara :) Hahaha facerape,
I have not posted

148
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,800
(Vilde :) Hihhihi that I was sorrii

149
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:20,600
(Cathrine :) Still have not got it,
Why Sana does not want to join?

150
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,400
(Vilde :) She told us that it was
Because of the values ​​of the Abi time is ...

151
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:30,200
... but is strange because they used to be
Never had anything against these values ​​...

152
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,200
(Sara :) Determines her parents. she had
Full of panic that they come-

153
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,200
As we celebrated with her. Definitely not
Simply as Muslima in the Abi-moving

154
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,200
However,
That she is not there.

155
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:43,800
(Kjersti) She is
Still on this site?

156
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:55,200
It's not that I'm Muslima,
But because you're a damn wrong

157
00:17:54,200 --> 00:18:00,200
Should I teach you for
The final exam?

158
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,000
(Isak :) Your serious? What's happening?

159
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:18,200
Because my brother and his duff-
Pals have beaten you,

160
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:24,000
- I believe that I am
I owe you this.

161
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,400
(Isak :) They did not hit me.

162
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:39,400
Should I help you or not?

163
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:47,800
(Isak :) Yes, of course!

164
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:53,200
Tomorrow after school?

165
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,200
Or do you want to drink?

166
00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:08.800
(Isak :) Morning after school is fat.
I am finished at 14.30. You?

167
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,700
16.00, wait for me in the canteen

168
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,400
(Isak :) Can not you be easy
Come to my house?

169
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,000
Yes.

170
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,400
<B> Friday </ b>

171
00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:40.940
-Hello.
-Hi.

172
00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.980
Hello, Sana.

173
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:48,020
-Where did you last see him?
- In bed, but I can not find him.

174
00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:54.600
Sorry for the stress. I wanted
Exceptionally times on time to work.

175
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,920
- Nice here.
-Thank you.

176
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:09,580
I'm rumbling on flea markets
And only took the cheapest.

177
00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:14.300
-You call the "rumbrödeln"?
-Yes, it was so.

178
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,380
We have quite there
Beautiful much taken.

179
00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:20.300
Yes.

180
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,980
You should have seen,
As it was before.

181
00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:26.320
Did you find anything?

182
00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:31.900
- Do you remember the crispbread?
-I will.

183
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:37,860
Look on the way outside
Wash basin and take the laundry ...

184
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:43,340
-Now? I have to be there in five minutes.
-Yes. From the washer into the dryer.

185
00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:46.940
- It takes ten minutes.
-This does not take ten minutes!

186
00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:52.100
When you had forgotten this,
Smelled of mold. For real!

187
00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:58.180
You're just sensitive.
That was two hours.

188
00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:03.760
If it is so important to you,
I do it. OK?

189
00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:10.880
See you later. It was nice to see you,
Sana. Good luck studying!

190
00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:17.380
I always confuse
Protists with prokaryotes.

191
00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:21.180
They are ...

192
00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:24.780
That is ... Yes ...

193
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:29,660
OK. "Back to basic", in principle.

194
00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:34.380
-Yes.
-Prokaryotes are the first living organisms,

195
00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:38.180
- which was 3.5 billion years ago
In the sea.

196
00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:45.020
According to the prokaryote organisms
Emerged the protists.

197
00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:48.580
And protists are unicellular beings.

198
00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:54.700
From these monoclinic creatures have
Developed multicellular organisms,

199
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58.140
-the colonies have formed,
From which larger animals emerged.

200
00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:01.860
With "larger animals" I mean, for example,

201
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:05,900
-Fishing jellyfish and mussels,
Which you see on the model.

202
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:10, 160
Do you know the model?

203
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15.140
-No, not memorized.
-Then learn the model by heart.

204
00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:19.620
You must be able to do this in the exam,
Because this is guaranteed.

205
00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:25.780
Just write the explanation,
Which I have just given you.

206
00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:29.800
Yes.

207
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,920
232 ...

208
00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:40.740
If you ever open Facebook ...

209
00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:45.620
I have a link for you
To "I love science", -

210
00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:50.560
- which is exactly relevant.

211
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,300
Did you find him?

212
00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:04.060
Yes...

213
00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:08.360
Yes, okay ... In English ...

214
00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:13.200
I can certainly translate.

215
00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:36.640
Were not you offering me anything?

216
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,940
Uh ...

217
00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:44.140
Yes, would you like something to drink?

218
00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:47.580
-Tea.
-You want a tea? Gladly.

219
00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:51.480
I'll make you a tea.

220
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:11,300
Search for "sara" in messages

221
00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:17.740
-What are you doing there?
-Nothing.

222
00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:21.260
I just have to
The WiFi name.

223
00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:24.700
You could have asked me.
He is "Yellow Curtains".

224
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27.420
- Yarn Curtains?
- Yellow curtains.

225
00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:30.460
What tea do you want?

226
00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:33.500
"Green tea and lemon"

227
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:38,740
-or "apple and cinamon"
- "pomme et canelle"?

228
00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:42.440
Green tea.

229
00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:47.120
(Notification)

230
00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:55.800
(Noora :) Hey girl.
Shall we meet?

231
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,400
I know you're stressed because of the exam
But it has been so long ago.

232
00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:05.400
And something great happened, of which
I have to tell you. Do you have time?

233
00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:10.200
So...

234
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:24,500
You just have hot water
Taken out of the tap?

235
00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:27.600
Yes.

236
00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:36.040
We do not have a water cooker, so ...

237
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:42,880
I do not know how Even it creates,
Without boiling water to cook tea.

238
00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:50.680
I know he's at it
Not in this way.

239
00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:14.160
You, Sana ...
I have to ask you something

240
00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:21.960
Why do you really have me?
Not said you know Even?

241
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,620
Because I knew you were me
Would ask for him.

242
00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:33.800
And what is so bad about it?

243
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,700
I think Even should be self
May decide,

244
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44.720
-how much of his past
Price.

245
00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:53.480
You do not want it all
Share your own past.

246
00:26:56.680 --> 00:27:00,000
You are a good person.

247
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,560
(A phone rings)

248
00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:08.300
Hello?

249
00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:10.940
Shit, Even!

250
00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:14.640
You have done it? Surprise...!

251
00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:24.500
So, I can do that then
Also make it yourself.

252
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,060
Have fun.

253
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:31,060
You also. Yes. Bye.

254
00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:33.060
Take care.

255
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:39,800
I have to go now
Down into the wash basement.

256
00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:43.720
I will be back soon.

257
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:54,684
... You will always have a place in my
Hearts. You were my first love ...

258
00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:56.800
You also

259
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Have you heard what Vilde about the
Solarium chain has said? Totally dumb

260
00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:19.284
She says:"The solarium chain stands for
The values ​​of women. "Your seriousness?

261
00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:47,000
(A door is opened
And again closed)

262
00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:56.740
OK.

263
00:29:57.040 --> 00:30:01.680
- Now we must get a tooth.
- "Let's go, bitches."
