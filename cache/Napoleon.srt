It has become increasingly clear,

167
00:16:28,447 --> 00:16:33,118
that your motivations are to use
this blade to your ultimate power!

There is no man in this room

[Barras]
You are not a defender of freedom.

You have deemed yourself judge,
jury and executioner, have you not?

You're worse than Caesar!
Worse than Caesar!

There is a very young man who wishes
to see you.

His name is, uh, Eugène Beauharnais.

[clears throat]

General Bonaparte.

Yes?

232
00:22:43,572 --> 00:22:47,743
My name is Eugène Beauharnais,
son of Joséphine Beauharnais.

233
00:22:48,493 --> 00:22:49,494
What do you want?

234
00:22:50,621 --> 00:22:52,039
My father's saber.

235
00:22:52,664 --> 00:22:57,085
I-It was taken from him before
he was arrested and executed.

236
00:22:58,086 --> 00:22:59,338
Yes?

237
00:22:59,421 --> 00:23:03,675
I-It would mean a great deal to me and
to my mother if it were returned to us.

238
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:05,636
It's all we have of him.

239
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:07,179
The sword is a weapon.

240
00:23:08,722 --> 00:23:11,808
I cannot allow citizens
to have weapons in their possession.

241
00:23:12,392 --> 00:23:15,979
The sword is a keepsake
for me to remember my dear late father.

242
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,565
Perhaps, but it is a weapon nevertheless.

243
00:23:22,194 --> 00:23:23,946
Young man, why are you here?

244
00:23:24,821 --> 00:23:28,700
My mother said that you were the only man
of authority to retrieve the sword.

245
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:43,841
All of these are
from officers who were sentenced to die.

246
00:23:46,718 --> 00:23:48,846
Did no one think
to attach names to any of them?

247
00:23:50,973 --> 00:23:53,892
No, there are no names.

Thank you.

251
00:24:37,978 --> 00:24:39,938
Is there reason to introduce myself?

252
00:24:41,899 --> 00:24:42,900
No, General.

253
00:24:43,734 --> 00:24:44,818
[Napoleon] Good.

254
00:24:46,862 --> 00:24:49,364

Do you find him without appeal?

261
00:25:40,123 --> 00:25:41,375
No.

262
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:43,126
Then perhaps that is enough.

263
00:25:48,507 --> 00:25:50,592
Do not underestimate your grace.

do you see an aristocrat?

No.

270
00:26:52,696 --> 00:26:54,740
My husband had more than one lover.

271
00:26:57,034 --> 00:26:59,912
And when his head was cut off,
all his mistresses watched.

272
00:27:06,835 --> 00:27:10,380
When I was in prison, I was told the
only way to survive was to get pregnant.

273
00:27:12,132 --> 00:27:14,468
So, General…

274
00:27:20,933 --> 00:27:23,519
do I need warn you of my indiscretions?

275
00:27:25,479 --> 00:27:26,480
No, madame.

276
00:27:28,065 --> 00:27:30,150
Does where I have been concern you?

277
00:27:35,447 --> 00:27:36,448
No, madame.

278
00:27:54,007 --> 00:27:56,093
If you look down, you'll see a surprise.

you will always want it.

Yes.

289
00:28:44,308 --> 00:28:46,018
There is a belief amongst the Committee

290
00:28:46,101 --> 00:28:48,979
that there is an attack
on the Council coming by this mob.

291
00:28:50,314 --> 00:28:54,651
I have less than 4,000 troops
and very little in the way of weapons.

There are 40 cannons in Sablons.
I could have them here in three hours.

This mob is 20,000 strong.

Yes.

As my second-in-command,
what would you intend to do

296
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:14,630
if this assignment of defense
was transferred to you?

297
00:29:21,386 --> 00:29:24,598
I accept, on the condition
that I command this as I see fit.

298
00:29:24,681 --> 00:29:26,266
Without interruption.

299
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:29,728

[Napoleon] Dear Joséphine,

328
00:32:38,876 --> 00:32:43,088
I follow in the footsteps
of Alexander the Great and Caesar,

00:32:43,172 --> 00:32:45,507
as I have been sent to liberate Egypt.

I have 40,000 men,

331
00:32:48,886 --> 00:32:52,890
and the sights are wondrous,
and the weather is stifling hot.

332
00:32:54,558 --> 00:32:57,978
I have already conquered Italy,
who surrendered without conflict.

[Egyptian officer shouting]

334
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:03,275
[Napoleon] The Directory has approved
my plan for attacking England

335
00:33:03,358 --> 00:33:04,860
through their eastern empire.

But my achievements seem slight,
as they keep us apart.

[Napoleon] Dear wife,

342
00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:41,688
This love I have for you
is a kind of death.

343
00:33:42,606 --> 00:33:44,983
There is no survival for me except in you.

344
00:33:45,067 --> 00:33:46,485
Hello again.

345
00:33:46,568 --> 00:33:47,819
[Napoleon] What are you doing?

346
00:33:48,403 --> 00:33:49,488
No letters from you.

347
00:33:49,571 --> 00:33:50,614
Good morning, Lucille.

348
00:33:50,697 --> 00:33:53,075
[Napoleon] If you loved me,
you'd write me twice a day.

349
00:33:53,951 --> 00:33:56,370
Tell me there are no snakes in your bed,

350
00:33:56,453 --> 00:33:59,748
in your legs, inside what is mine.

351
00:34:00,999 --> 00:34:02,501
You must write me and tell me

352
00:34:02,584 --> 00:34:06,088
that you realize that I love you
beyond the limits of imagination,

353
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,091
that only you can please me.

[soldier chuckles]

356
00:36:30,107 --> 00:36:34,862
Are there limits to what I can tell you?

357
00:36:36,905 --> 00:36:37,948
There shouldn't be.

358
00:36:39,992 --> 00:36:42,995
Should I tell you something
at the risk of giving you personal pain?

359
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,249
Yes. [chuckles]

360
00:36:53,213 --> 00:36:57,801
Your wife has taken
a lover named Hippolyte Charles.

361

[laughing]

362
00:37:18,363 --> 00:37:21,742
-You expect me to believe this? [laughs]
-Yes. [chuckles]

363
00:37:22,743 --> 00:37:25,078
That my wife would do this to me? Mmm.

364
00:37:26,205 --> 00:37:27,206
Yes.

365
00:37:37,591 --> 00:37:39,968
No dessert for you. You may leave.

366
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,932
I would never lie to you.

How do you know this?

368
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:12,376
Lucille is my lover. She writes to me.

369
00:38:13,919 --> 00:38:15,963
Joséphine's lady-in-waiting is your lover?

370

Prepare two frigates and two
smaller vessels in the greatest secrecy.

371
00:38:32,563 --> 00:38:33,897
I'm returning home.

-Napoleon…
-Hmm?

373
00:38:36,275 --> 00:38:38,277
…this will be seen as desertion.

374
00:38:40,988 --> 00:38:44,575
General Kléber will be informed of
his succession in command after I've left.

Where's my wife?

00:39:47,888 --> 00:39:49,640
She has left to greet you in Lyon.

-Lyon?
-Yes, sir.

No. I don't.

Then why?

Because you're what? Say it.

I'm sorry.

that I am the most important thing
in the world!

407

You are.

408

-Say it!
-You're-- You're-- You're-- You're--

You're the most important thing
in my life, in the world. You a--

-And without me, you are nothing.
-I'm nothing.

And you will do anything!

I'll do anything.

I'm not built like other men.

414

Did you have affairs?

Of course I did.

00:43:39,494 --> 00:43:40,954
And did you love them?

No. No, I did not.

00:43:50,923 --> 00:43:52,049
Were they pretty?

435
00:43:54,259 --> 00:43:56,094
Yes, some of them.

436
00:43:59,097 --> 00:44:00,599
They served their purpose.

437
00:44:02,851 --> 00:44:03,852
More than I do?

438
00:44:04,811 --> 00:44:08,649
They cried less.
That made them more attractive.

00:44:12,069 --> 00:44:13,070
Don't--

440
00:44:14,404 --> 00:44:16,949
Don't leave me. Please, don't leave me.

441

[whispering] Just don't leave me.

442

You don't have to forgive me.
Just promise me you won't leave again.

What is it that made you desert
your troops in Egypt?

what country are we in?

447
00:44:48,397 --> 00:44:51,400
Because she doesn't resemble
the France that I left.

448
00:44:54,903 --> 00:44:57,990
Who should be responsible
for her governance while I'm away?

449
00:44:59,616 --> 00:45:01,743
Because it is not you, Citizen Gohier.

450
00:45:02,578 --> 00:45:03,579
It is not you.

451
00:45:03,662 --> 00:45:07,374
It certainly is not you.
Although you're very good at scowling.

452
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:12,421
It is not you, Barras.

453
00:45:12,504 --> 00:45:13,547
Or you, Talleyrand.

454

Or you, Sieyès.

455
00:45:17,509 --> 00:45:18,510
So, who?

-No?
-[sighs]

458
00:45:27,227 --> 00:45:30,022
I have returned to France
to find her bankrupt.

00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,775
Printing money that is spent within hours,

460
00:45:35,694 --> 00:45:37,988
the Austro-Russian overrun of Italy,

461
00:45:39,072 --> 00:45:41,325
the Anglo-Russian occupation of Holland,

462
00:45:42,075 --> 00:45:47,956
and what appears to be
the imminent invasion of France herself.

463
00:45:50,918 --> 00:45:54,421
And yet, you accuse me of desertion.

464
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:59,218
Added to which the discovery
that my wife is a slut.

465
00:46:12,397 --> 00:46:17,569
The only thing that every French citizen
can agree on is that you are our Caesar.

466
00:46:21,156 --> 00:46:22,157
What do you want?

467
00:46:24,159 --> 00:46:25,577
[chuckles]

468
00:46:26,245 --> 00:46:27,246
Well…

469
00:46:29,706 --> 00:46:33,168
the people would accept my rule
if I have your support.

470
00:46:35,546 --> 00:46:40,175
Like you, though,
I believe that the Directory is corrupt.

471
00:46:41,802 --> 00:46:46,723
But together, we can save this country
from a restoration of the monarchy,

472
00:46:47,683 --> 00:46:49,935
and we can preserve
the ideals of the Revolution.

473
00:46:52,646 --> 00:46:56,400
And I think that
a seizure of power is possible

474
00:46:57,734 --> 00:46:59,570
with your help, at the right time.

475
00:46:59,653 --> 00:47:02,865
And I think this is the right time.

476
00:47:03,615 --> 00:47:06,285
So, you expect me to be your sword?

[chuckles]

478
00:47:12,916 --> 00:47:17,754
I expect that a coup d'état,
well-timed, well-executed…

479
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:23,302
could transfer power
into the hands of three consuls:

00:47:24,219 --> 00:47:25,512
myself, Ducos…

481
00:47:28,098 --> 00:47:29,141
and you.

00:48:01,381 --> 00:48:02,382
Hmm.

495
00:48:03,217 --> 00:48:05,344
I'm going to make this very simple
for you.

496
00:48:06,345 --> 00:48:09,723
I have documents announcing
your resignation from the Council.

497
00:48:10,349 --> 00:48:13,393
You must retire
before you have your breakfast, please.

498
00:48:14,645 --> 00:48:18,982
Tell them I return with joy
to the ranks of simple citizen.

499
00:48:20,943 --> 00:48:21,944
I shall.

500
00:48:25,864 --> 00:48:27,115
[knocking]

501
00:48:27,199 --> 00:48:29,201
There are some gentlemen here to see you.

502
00:48:30,035 --> 00:48:33,956
Citizen Moulins, we have
a letter of resignation for you to sign.

503
00:48:34,831 --> 00:48:37,584
-No, no, no. I am eating my breakfast.
-[spouse] No.

504
00:48:37,668 --> 00:48:40,337
I am enjoying a succulent breakfast.

505
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:44,758
This is outrageous! I shall finish
my breakfast before you touch me!

506
00:48:44,842 --> 00:48:47,678
-[cries] No!
-Enjoy your breakfast.

507
00:48:48,345 --> 00:48:50,764
[wailing]

508
00:49:09,283 --> 00:49:10,576
[Council member 1] Director!

509
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:13,787
I believe the time has come
to demand an explanation.

510
00:49:13,871 --> 00:49:15,497
-[Council member 2] Hear, hear!
-[clamoring]

511
00:49:15,581 --> 00:49:20,711
Uh, thi-this emergency session
is to draw a list of nominations

512
00:49:20,794 --> 00:49:25,299
for a-- a new Directory
to deal with the threat--

513
00:49:25,382 --> 00:49:27,968
-[members clamoring]
-the threat of the royalists.

514
00:49:28,051 --> 00:49:30,179
We are being asked to pass a resolution

515
00:49:30,262 --> 00:49:33,098
forming a provisional government
to three councils:

516
00:49:34,224 --> 00:49:37,728
General Bonaparte and Citizen Sieyès
and Roger Ducos.

517
00:49:39,313 --> 00:49:41,440
Where are the five members
of the Directory?

518
00:49:41,523 --> 00:49:43,567
[members clamoring]

519
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:45,569
[Council member 1]
Have they magically disappeared?

520
00:49:45,652 --> 00:49:48,780
-[Council member 3 chuckles]
-And we are here, surrounded by troops,

521
00:49:48,864 --> 00:49:50,699
isolated far from Paris.

522
00:49:50,782 --> 00:49:52,367
-[clamoring]
-Order! Order!

523
00:49:52,451 --> 00:49:55,287
[Council member 1]
This is becoming increasingly clear:

524
00:49:56,205 --> 00:49:59,082
that your brother, Napoleon Bonaparte,

525
00:50:00,292 --> 00:50:04,171
with his show of military might,
is acting as an outlaw.

526
00:50:04,254 --> 00:50:07,424
-[members clamoring]
-[Lucien] I vow to solve this matter.

527
00:50:07,508 --> 00:50:11,261
[Council member 1] And that this is
a ridiculous and poorly executed takeover.

528
00:50:11,345 --> 00:50:12,971
A power-hungry upstart.

529
00:50:13,055 --> 00:50:16,016
-[members shouting]
-[Napoleon] Enough! Enough!

530
00:50:16,099 --> 00:50:20,020
If there is any question
of what is happening here, I will answer!

531
00:50:20,103 --> 00:50:21,396
How dare you!

532
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:25,317
This is--
You have violated the constitution!

533
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:27,444
-You have--
-[Council member 4] Hold him!

534
00:50:28,028 --> 00:50:30,822
-[Council member 5] Get him!
-[struggling]

535
00:50:30,906 --> 00:50:32,616
[all clamoring]

536
00:50:36,787 --> 00:50:38,997
-Arrest him!
-Stop him!

537
00:50:39,081 --> 00:50:40,624
[panting]

538
00:50:40,707 --> 00:50:42,000
Oh, fuck!

539
00:50:42,084 --> 00:50:44,086
[Council members shouting]

540
00:50:45,087 --> 00:50:46,088
[yelps]

541
00:50:47,506 --> 00:50:48,882
[Council member 6] Kill him!

542
00:50:50,008 --> 00:50:51,969
[grunts, panting]

543
00:50:52,970 --> 00:50:56,014
[guards straining]

544
00:50:56,098 --> 00:50:57,808
-[mutters]
-Let me through!

545
00:51:00,853 --> 00:51:02,104
Right. [pants]

546
00:51:02,187 --> 00:51:06,275
We are being terrorized
by deputies armed with daggers!

547
00:51:06,817 --> 00:51:10,279
And these madmen have outlawed themselves

548
00:51:10,362 --> 00:51:12,990
by their attempt
on the liberty of this country!

549
00:51:13,073 --> 00:51:15,576
-They're trying to kill me!
-They're trying to kill him.

550
00:51:16,076 --> 00:51:18,161
-[Council member 7] Open these doors!
-[grunts]

551
00:51:20,497 --> 00:51:21,498
[Lucien grunts]

552
00:51:22,374 --> 00:51:24,042
[Council member 3] Let us out of here!

553
00:51:24,126 --> 00:51:28,964
I will kill my brother if he betrays
the freedom of the French people!

554
00:51:30,424 --> 00:51:31,925
Get in there now!

555
00:51:32,009 --> 00:51:34,428
-[Lucien] Fuck.
-[guards shouting]

556
00:51:38,098 --> 00:51:40,225
[guard 1] Move, move. Get back. Back.

557
00:51:41,518 --> 00:51:42,895
[guard 2] Move it. Move it!

558
00:51:44,771 --> 00:51:47,900
-[guard 3] Back. Move back.
-[guard 4] Move back. Out of the way.

559
00:51:48,567 --> 00:51:50,652
[guard 5] Move, move. Backwards.

560
00:51:55,365 --> 00:51:57,034
[Council members gasping]

561
00:51:57,117 --> 00:51:58,452
Good luck, brother.

562
00:52:02,789 --> 00:52:04,791
[Napoleon panting]

563
00:52:09,171 --> 00:52:10,172
Stand aside.

564
00:52:23,101 --> 00:52:24,353
Shall we vote?

565
00:52:27,856 --> 00:52:28,857
Where are we going?

566
00:52:28,941 --> 00:52:31,568
[people cheering]

567
00:52:31,652 --> 00:52:33,570
All our harsh words are behind us.

568
00:52:36,406 --> 00:52:38,951
I need you to be my most tender friend.

569
00:52:42,788 --> 00:52:45,958
Over this door is our destiny.

570
00:52:49,878 --> 00:52:52,506
[cheering continues]

571
00:54:02,701 --> 00:54:04,703
[French officer] Present arms!

572
00:54:17,257 --> 00:54:19,343
-[aristocrat] First Consul.
-My lord.

573
00:54:20,344 --> 00:54:21,345
Milady.

574
00:54:22,596 --> 00:54:23,764
[inhales sharply]

575
00:54:25,265 --> 00:54:27,142
-Citizen Bonaparte.
-Citizen Bonaparte.

576
00:54:27,226 --> 00:54:28,769
-First Consul.
-Citizen Bonaparte.

577
00:54:28,852 --> 00:54:30,062
First Consul.

578
00:54:33,607 --> 00:54:34,900
Come, little one.

579
00:54:35,609 --> 00:54:38,529
You get into the bed of your master's.

580
00:54:39,446 --> 00:54:41,281
[chuckling]

581
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:45,702
[aristocrats chattering]

582
00:54:51,959 --> 00:54:54,753
Hello, madame!

583
00:54:54,837 --> 00:54:56,421
Hello, good evening.

584
00:55:01,969 --> 00:55:03,595
Mother, the Duke of Avignon.

585
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:04,847
It's good to meet you.

586
00:55:14,857 --> 00:55:17,359
Ah. Could this be Joséphine?

587
00:55:18,569 --> 00:55:21,196
-Mother, Joséphine. Joséphine, Mother.
-[Letizia] Good to see you.

588
00:55:21,738 --> 00:55:23,991
Oh, it's Charles.

589
00:55:24,950 --> 00:55:25,951
This way.

590
00:55:35,586 --> 00:55:39,173
[scribe] "Your Majesty, England
and France are wasting their prosperity."

591
00:55:39,256 --> 00:55:40,174
Let me try again.

592
00:55:42,676 --> 00:55:45,304
-Your Royal Majesty, England and France…
-[clears throat]

593
00:55:45,387 --> 00:55:48,182
-are wasting their prosperity…
-Your-- Your Majesty.

594
00:55:48,807 --> 00:55:49,975
What did I say?

595
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:54,271
[stammers]
"Your-- Your-- Your Royal Majesty."

596
00:55:55,522 --> 00:55:57,649
"Your Royal Ma"-- [inhales deeply]

597
00:55:57,733 --> 00:56:01,528
Your Majesty, England
and France are wasting their prosperity.

598
00:56:03,906 --> 00:56:06,325
I am not ashamed to take the initiative.

599
00:56:06,408 --> 00:56:09,161
I have, I think,
sufficiently proven to the whole world

600
00:56:09,244 --> 00:56:12,080
that I do not fear the chances of war.

601
00:56:13,415 --> 00:56:17,711
But peace is my heartfelt wish
for England and France.

602
00:56:19,129 --> 00:56:20,130
Read it back to me.

603
00:56:21,048 --> 00:56:24,551
I have notified all foreign powers
of your accession to the Consul,

604
00:56:24,635 --> 00:56:28,138
I have addressed letters
to all diplomatic agents abroad,

605
00:56:28,222 --> 00:56:32,142
and I understand that you have made
friendly overtures of peace to England.

606
00:56:32,226 --> 00:56:33,519
Ca-Caulaincourt.

607
00:56:34,561 --> 00:56:37,356
What I need from you is
a better understanding

608
00:56:37,439 --> 00:56:39,233
of the Russian Tsar Alexander.

609
00:56:39,942 --> 00:56:42,778
Would you consider the tsar an ally
to England or France?

610
00:56:44,571 --> 00:56:48,575
Well, I would think that his trade
with England is more beneficial to him

611
00:56:48,659 --> 00:56:50,077
than his trade with France.

612
00:56:50,661 --> 00:56:54,790
And do you have a sense of
British influence in the Russian courts?

613
00:56:54,873 --> 00:56:57,376
[Caulaincourt] I do not,
but I imagine it is quite robust.

614
00:56:58,669 --> 00:56:59,753
Robust?

615
00:57:04,842 --> 00:57:07,678
What kind of man is he? Describe him.

616
00:57:09,263 --> 00:57:11,098
Well, he's young. [sighs]

617
00:57:12,891 --> 00:57:14,393
-He's vain.
-[scoffs]

618
00:57:15,477 --> 00:57:17,479
He's popular, and he wishes to remain so.

619
00:57:17,563 --> 00:57:18,647
He's popular?

620
00:57:21,441 --> 00:57:22,442
Really?

621
00:57:22,526 --> 00:57:25,654
His greatest fear is to be killed
in his bed, like his father.

622
00:57:25,737 --> 00:57:27,489
[laughs]

623
00:57:28,490 --> 00:57:32,786
This makes him dangerously fickle
to whoever last has his attention.

624
00:57:33,912 --> 00:57:36,999
So he needs an ally
that he can also call a friend.

625
00:57:43,964 --> 00:57:45,174
No more bets.

626
00:57:48,844 --> 00:57:50,220
What a surprise.

627
00:57:50,888 --> 00:57:52,264
How nice to see you out.

628
00:57:53,348 --> 00:57:54,600
Excuse me, gentlemen.

629
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:57,603
Good evening.
I'm just trying to lose some money.

630
00:57:57,686 --> 00:58:01,273
Ah. Well, after this hand,
why don't you come and join me?

631
00:58:01,356 --> 00:58:03,066
I'm at my usual table.

632
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:04,318
That's a lovely idea.

633
00:58:06,361 --> 00:58:07,362
Good evening.

634
00:58:08,488 --> 00:58:10,782
Mmm. Did you hear?

635
00:58:12,784 --> 00:58:17,706
Your Majesty received a letter of peace
from the First Consul today.

636
00:58:19,583 --> 00:58:23,170
Monsieur Talleyrand, if I may be honest?

637
00:58:23,253 --> 00:58:24,254
Of course.

638
00:58:24,338 --> 00:58:29,092
Austria's coalition with England is
in such a strong position against France,

639
00:58:29,176 --> 00:58:33,055
that these peace overtures are clearly

640
00:58:33,138 --> 00:58:35,516
only for your handling
of French public opinion.

641
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:38,519
[chuckles] Oh, my friend.

642
00:58:40,562 --> 00:58:42,648
-You know me so well.
-[diplomat chuckles]

643
00:58:43,398 --> 00:58:46,860
Yes, it is true.
It is public opinion Napoleon is after.

644
00:58:46,944 --> 00:58:49,905
But my warning to you
is that he's as hungry for it

645
00:58:49,988 --> 00:58:52,074
as any man in the history of the world.

646
00:58:52,157 --> 00:58:53,951
So my suggestion, with respect,

647
00:58:54,034 --> 00:58:57,788
would be to take
this little offering of peace from him…

648
00:59:00,832 --> 00:59:06,547
or suffer the consequences
from a man bent on peace at any cost.

649
00:59:09,091 --> 00:59:11,802
The English ambassador, Lord Whitworth,
has arrived, Consul.

650
00:59:20,686 --> 00:59:23,897
Do not look at me as if
you don't know what I'm about to say.

651
00:59:25,607 --> 00:59:28,318
Are you aware of my letter of peace
to your king?

652
00:59:29,111 --> 00:59:30,153
I am not.

653
00:59:31,613 --> 00:59:32,906
Shall I repeat it?

654
00:59:32,990 --> 00:59:36,660
[inhales deeply] No, you may not. [sighs]

655
00:59:36,743 --> 00:59:39,121
Take this as a warning to your king.

656
00:59:39,204 --> 00:59:41,874
I will keep you guessing and scared.

657
00:59:41,957 --> 00:59:44,084
You will watch your borders and your back,

658
00:59:44,168 --> 00:59:47,087
and your manners are bound,
sooner or later, to be French.

659
00:59:47,171 --> 00:59:49,548
I will offer no more letters of peace,

660
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:54,052
and I will take the lack of a swift reply
as an act of disrespect!

661
00:59:54,136 --> 00:59:57,264
You think you're so great
because you have boats!

662
01:00:01,101 --> 01:00:03,937
'Tis a shame such a great man
should have no manners.

663
01:00:17,326 --> 01:00:18,327
Yes?

664
01:00:20,913 --> 01:00:21,914
Are you pleased?

665
01:00:24,583 --> 01:00:27,085
Are you about to tell me
something that will make me angry?

666
01:00:28,045 --> 01:00:29,421
Let's hope not.

667
01:00:29,505 --> 01:00:34,134
The European families think
nothing more of you than a Corsican thug.

668
01:00:34,885 --> 01:00:36,595
-Therefore…
-[chuckles]

669
01:00:36,678 --> 01:00:40,349
…I'm going to suggest something
that's been a long time arriving.

670
01:00:41,391 --> 01:00:46,063
I suggest that you abandon
your role as First Consul of France

671
01:00:47,022 --> 01:00:51,443
in exchange for the title
"Victorious Consul."

672
01:00:53,487 --> 01:00:55,906
By another name, "king."

673
01:00:55,989 --> 01:00:58,784
[chuckles]

674
01:00:58,867 --> 01:00:59,868
What?

675
01:00:59,952 --> 01:01:02,329
[scoffs] "King."

676
01:01:04,206 --> 01:01:05,749
Uh, yes, king.

677
01:01:08,627 --> 01:01:09,628
King?

678
01:01:20,514 --> 01:01:23,392
-[chuckles]
-Mmm.

679
01:01:23,475 --> 01:01:25,477
[murmuring]

680
01:01:29,648 --> 01:01:31,525
My hair has been set.

681
01:01:31,608 --> 01:01:34,403
-[murmuring continues]
-The way you like it.

682
01:01:36,864 --> 01:01:39,366
-[whines]
-[scoffs] Oh, you filthy man.

683
01:01:39,449 --> 01:01:40,993
My hair has been set now.

684
01:01:41,577 --> 01:01:44,037
[murmuring continues]

685
01:01:45,289 --> 01:01:47,541
I have the most beautiful wife.

686
01:01:47,624 --> 01:01:49,543
-[whines]
-I-- All right, come on then.

687
01:01:52,588 --> 01:01:53,589
Hat off.

688
01:01:55,966 --> 01:01:56,967
Mmm.

689
01:01:58,927 --> 01:02:00,053
[grunts]

690
01:02:00,804 --> 01:02:02,598
Give me your hand. Give me your hand.

691
01:02:03,682 --> 01:02:05,517
-You feel that?
-[sighs] What?

692
01:02:07,144 --> 01:02:08,270
Can you feel that?

693
01:02:08,353 --> 01:02:10,731
-That's yours. That's yours.
-[breathing heavily]

694
01:02:10,814 --> 01:02:11,940
It's yours.

695
01:02:12,024 --> 01:02:13,025
Thank you.

696
01:02:14,943 --> 01:02:16,820
[grunts, breathing heavily]

697
01:02:26,705 --> 01:02:28,415
[chuckles] Oh.

698
01:02:30,292 --> 01:02:31,502
[Napoleon] Mmm.

699
01:02:34,421 --> 01:02:37,382
Oh. [chuckles] Stop.

700
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:39,927
Why aren't you pregnant?

701
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:47,518
Is that a question,
or is that an accusation?

702
01:02:48,519 --> 01:02:49,937
-[Napoleon] Mmm.
-[sighs]

703
01:02:51,730 --> 01:02:52,940
It was a question.

704
01:02:53,732 --> 01:02:55,234
[grunts, chuckles]

705
01:02:55,317 --> 01:02:56,527
Now it's an accusation.

706
01:03:00,239 --> 01:03:03,242
Well, I've seen Dr. Corvisart,
and he has no answer.

707
01:03:07,621 --> 01:03:10,290
Only that I do
what Madame de Rémusat has done.

708
01:03:12,668 --> 01:03:13,669
[Napoleon] Which is?

709
01:03:13,752 --> 01:03:16,213
[sighs] Which is…

710
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:21,510
along with hopeful thinking
and a bit of red wine,

711
01:03:21,593 --> 01:03:24,429
he suggested I take the waters
at Aix-la-Chapelle.

712
01:03:27,891 --> 01:03:29,101
And why haven't you?

713
01:03:30,477 --> 01:03:33,355
As wife of the First Consul,
I haven't found the time.

714
01:03:33,438 --> 01:03:36,358
I spend many hours cleaning up after you.

715
01:03:40,904 --> 01:03:42,364
Find the time.

716
01:03:44,032 --> 01:03:47,536
[inhales sharply] I don't need to explain
to you the importance of this, do I?

717
01:03:48,495 --> 01:03:49,788
What, you want an heir?

718
01:03:50,581 --> 01:03:52,332
I want one now.

719
01:03:52,416 --> 01:03:54,126

[song ends]

726
01:05:00,150 --> 01:05:02,861
May God affirm you on his throne,

727
01:05:04,196 --> 01:05:09,159
and Christ give you to rule with him
in his eternal kingdom.

[attendees gasping]

729
01:05:35,227 --> 01:05:38,522
I found the crown of France in the gutter.

730
01:05:40,524 --> 01:05:44,862
I picked it up with the tip of my sword
and cleaned it…

731
01:05:46,947 --> 01:05:49,074
and place it atop my own head.

732
01:05:50,868 --> 01:05:52,870
[attendees murmuring]

733
01:06:15,684 --> 01:06:20,981
The most glorious,
the most august Napoleon,

734
01:06:21,064 --> 01:06:23,609
emperor of the French,

735
01:06:23,692 --> 01:06:27,029
is crowned and enthroned!

736
01:06:27,863 --> 01:06:29,573
Long live the emperor!

737
01:06:29,656 --> 01:06:32,159
[all] Long live the emperor!

738
01:06:32,743 --> 01:06:34,661
Long live the emperor!

[tapping]

741
01:07:14,701 --> 01:07:16,495
[Napoleon] I do not support this idea.

742
01:07:16,578 --> 01:07:19,248
You suggest divorce after years of debate.

743
01:07:19,331 --> 01:07:21,124
You can see that it has me divided.

744
01:07:21,208 --> 01:07:22,209
[Talleyrand] Mmm.

745
01:07:23,836 --> 01:07:25,254
[sighs]

746
01:07:25,337 --> 01:07:27,089
I am not ambitious.

747
01:07:27,172 --> 01:07:29,007
I've never declared war with anyone.

748
01:07:32,761 --> 01:07:33,762
No.

749
01:07:36,014 --> 01:07:40,352
You are the greatest leader
in the history of the world

750
01:07:40,435 --> 01:07:42,396
and the world's only chance at peace.

751
01:07:47,442 --> 01:07:51,363
The security of the empire and peace
in the world depends upon an heir.

[dinner guests chattering]

754
01:07:59,037 --> 01:08:02,207
[Joséphine] It was an option. [chuckles]

755
01:08:02,291 --> 01:08:03,792
And I said it at the time.

756
01:08:11,049 --> 01:08:12,676
[Napoleon] Are you enjoying yourself?

757
01:08:14,636 --> 01:08:18,098
I'm going to war to defend our people,

758
01:08:18,182 --> 01:08:20,642
and my wife cannot provide me an heir.

759
01:08:24,354 --> 01:08:27,024
If you do not bear me a child tonight,

760
01:08:28,817 --> 01:08:30,359
there will be a divorce.

761
01:08:32,738 --> 01:08:36,116
Hasn't been enough lovemaking
in this home to bear a child.

762
01:08:37,201 --> 01:08:38,535
Yes, there has.

763
01:08:39,745 --> 01:08:43,372
-[Joséphine sighs]
-There have been years of it. Years.

764
01:08:45,125 --> 01:08:46,542
And with more than just me.

765
01:08:47,336 --> 01:08:51,423
-[inhales deeply] Oh.
-And still you are empty.

766
01:08:51,506 --> 01:08:53,008
And you're fat.

767
01:08:54,801 --> 01:08:58,055
I enjoy my meals. I do.

768
01:08:58,970 --> 01:09:00,724
Destiny has brought me here.

769
01:09:00,807 --> 01:09:03,268
Destiny has brought me this lamb chop.

770
01:09:06,854 --> 01:09:07,898
[yelps]

771
01:09:28,710 --> 01:09:29,711

Come.

[sighs]

776
01:09:44,475 --> 01:09:48,354
I love your talents and your taste.

777
01:09:50,607 --> 01:09:53,277
And while I'm away,
I will miss your grace.

778
01:09:53,777 --> 01:09:55,320
-[sighs]
-And your dignity.

779
01:09:56,613 --> 01:09:58,407
And I will come back to you.

To today's victory. Hmm?

786
01:10:35,235 --> 01:10:37,237
Look, I'm always here for you, Francis.

787
01:10:38,238 --> 01:10:41,533
But I must admit, I'm overwhelmed
with the excitement of the battlefield.

788
01:10:42,576 --> 01:10:44,369
I should not deceive you, Alexander.

789
01:10:44,453 --> 01:10:47,581
This battle against him will be brutal
and terrifying.

My God, it's cold here.
I miss your warmth.

797
01:11:34,378 --> 01:11:38,006
On this day, we celebrate
the first anniversary of our coronation.

798
01:11:39,842 --> 01:11:42,511
My previous ally
has now joined with my enemy.

799
01:11:43,637 --> 01:11:47,474
The Russian Tsar Alexander
joined forces with the prince of Austria.

800
01:11:48,559 --> 01:11:51,186
I have heard that
he's been studying the art of war

801
01:11:51,270 --> 01:11:53,021
and trying to emulate my battle tactics.

802
01:11:53,105 --> 01:11:54,022
More fires.

803
01:11:54,106 --> 01:11:55,524
He tries to copy me,

804
01:11:56,191 --> 01:11:58,944
but he is a little boy
who will make a terrible mistake.

805
01:12:00,112 --> 01:12:04,074
I am certain I will bring the laurels of
another glorious victory to my army today.

Please come in where it's warm.

-Thank you.
-You must forgive me.

01:21:27,054 --> 01:21:29,556
This has been my only palace
for the last two months.

Seems very agreeable.
You make excellent use of it.

Well, we do what we can
on the battlefield.

-Yes, we do, don't we?
-Mm-hmm.

It's nice to finally meet another emperor.

Uh, where, may I ask, is Alexander?

886
01:21:45,781 --> 01:21:48,158
Are we waiting for his arrival
before we get started?

887
01:21:48,242 --> 01:21:51,954
I do not believe he will be joining us.

-He's beside himself with rage.
-[sighs]

889
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:01,213
I realize I must compliment you
for making me commit an enormous error.

-An error?
-[Napoleon] Yes.

891
01:22:05,175 --> 01:22:06,593
What error have you made?

892
01:22:08,595 --> 01:22:11,723
To be speaking with you here
and accepting this invitation for peace,

893
01:22:12,599 --> 01:22:14,309
I have not followed up my victory.

894
01:22:15,769 --> 01:22:19,022
I could have taken the whole Russian
and Austrian army prisoners.

895
01:22:21,942 --> 01:22:22,943
Yes.

But after all, there will be less tears.

And I know you will remember
this gesture of kindness. Yes?

Thank you. [sighs]

It is time to put this mystery to rest,
Emperor.

911
01:23:57,746 --> 01:24:00,541
I want to know if it's you or Joséphine.

912
01:24:01,124 --> 01:24:07,923
And to that end, we will conduct
a very practical experiment.

01:24:10,759 --> 01:24:13,929
At the end of the hallway-- Take this--

is 18-year-old
Eléonore Denuelle de La Plaigne.

916
01:24:27,359 --> 01:24:29,528
She's brunette with brown eyes.

917
01:24:30,112 --> 01:24:32,281
And the object of this, well,

918
01:24:32,364 --> 01:24:37,619
hardly unpleasant task is to see
if you can father a child.

919
01:24:38,996 --> 01:24:40,998
-And then we will have an answer…
-Mmm.

920
01:24:41,081 --> 01:24:42,833
…to this nagging question

921
01:24:42,916 --> 01:24:47,963
of who is keeping who from an heir
to the throne of France.

922

[sighs]

923
01:24:53,468 --> 01:24:54,595
Shall we go?

924
01:24:55,220 --> 01:24:56,555
May I have another, please?

925
01:25:43,977 --> 01:25:45,979
[chattering, laughing]

926
01:25:56,406 --> 01:25:58,033
The girl is pregnant.

927
01:25:58,116 --> 01:26:00,327
You made her pregnant. [chuckles]

928
01:26:01,995 --> 01:26:02,996
[Napoleon] Mm-hmm.

929

[chattering, laughing]

930
01:26:13,382 --> 01:26:15,008
Uh, I know I didn't see her.

931
01:26:15,092 --> 01:26:16,927
[speaking indistinctly]

932
01:26:22,224 --> 01:26:24,393
When are you going to insist we divorce?

933
01:26:26,103 --> 01:26:27,896
Oh, isn't that wonderful?

934
01:26:29,731 --> 01:26:33,777
From the only woman that I've ever loved
and given all that I've conquered.

935
01:26:33,861 --> 01:26:39,825
I'm just too tired to wait
for you to tell me what I know is coming.

936
01:26:42,244 --> 01:26:43,495
If you insist.

937
01:26:46,456 --> 01:26:48,959
[sighs] I'll make it easy for you.

938
01:26:53,505 --> 01:26:57,926
[sighs] I know
you will have a bastard child.

939
01:27:03,140 --> 01:27:06,935
If I succeed in making the birth of a boy
that I shall call my own son,

940
01:27:07,853 --> 01:27:11,815
I want you as a witness
to pretend the confinement of the empress.

941
01:27:14,026 --> 01:27:15,235
[stammers] Your Highness,

942
01:27:15,319 --> 01:27:18,780
you are asking me to lie about the status
of the mother of your heir.

943
01:27:20,490 --> 01:27:22,492
That is another way of putting it, yes.

944
01:27:22,576 --> 01:27:23,577
[scoffs]

945
01:27:24,745 --> 01:27:30,501
Emperor… [sighs] …it is my honor
and my duty, of course,

946
01:27:30,584 --> 01:27:32,503
to do as you require of me.

947
01:27:32,586 --> 01:27:36,465
But if asked, I cannot contain
that which I know to be the truth.

948
01:27:37,508 --> 01:27:39,510
And painful though it is,

949
01:27:39,593 --> 01:27:44,097
the truth is that the empress is
no longer capable of bearing you a child.

950
01:27:55,442 --> 01:27:58,237
My good Joséphine. [sighs]

951
01:27:59,696 --> 01:28:00,697
Hmm?

952
01:28:02,491 --> 01:28:04,117
You know how I've loved you.

953
01:28:07,079 --> 01:28:10,457
It is you, to you alone,

954
01:28:11,667 --> 01:28:15,254
that I owe the few moments
of happiness I have known in this world.

955
01:28:15,337 --> 01:28:16,380
Hmm.

956
01:28:19,216 --> 01:28:22,970
My destiny is more powerful than my will.

957
01:28:25,055 --> 01:28:31,061
And my affections must yield
to the interests of my people.

958
01:28:31,645 --> 01:28:33,647
[chuckling]

959
01:28:52,708 --> 01:28:55,961
The imperial decree
for the dissolution of the marriage

960
01:28:57,129 --> 01:29:00,841
between the Emperor Napoleon
and the Empress Joséphine.

[sniffles]

962
01:29:09,474 --> 01:29:14,771
"My people desire that this throne,
where providence has placed me,

963
01:29:15,314 --> 01:29:16,982
would be given to my children.

964
01:29:18,734 --> 01:29:22,905
However, I have lost hope
of having children from my marriage

965
01:29:22,988 --> 01:29:25,657
to my beloved wife, Empress Joséphine.

966
01:29:26,658 --> 01:29:30,746
I have then been led to listen
only to the good of the state

967
01:29:30,829 --> 01:29:34,249
and to want the dissolution
of years of my life."

You have embellished my life for 15 years.

will remain forever etched in my heart.

of the man brought to us by providence

977
01:30:25,050 --> 01:30:27,511
to mend the evils of a terrible revolution

978
01:30:28,136 --> 01:30:31,515
and restore faith, the throne
and the social order."

979
01:30:37,479 --> 01:30:38,856
Sorry.

980
01:30:38,939 --> 01:30:40,065
[stammers, coughs]

981
01:30:40,732 --> 01:30:43,318
-Emperor. Wait.
-Go. No, listen, listen. All right?

982
01:30:43,402 --> 01:30:46,029
This is for your country.
That's what this is, all right?

983
01:30:46,113 --> 01:30:47,739
-[whimpers]
-Now say it.

984
01:30:49,199 --> 01:30:50,409
Say it.

985
01:30:57,124 --> 01:31:00,169
"Our marriage has become an obstacle
for the prosperity of France.

986
01:31:02,171 --> 01:31:04,715
Agreeing to the dissolution
of our marriage,

987
01:31:05,340 --> 01:31:07,801
as I must, does not change my feelings.

988
01:31:14,016 --> 01:31:20,355
The emperor will have in me
a-always his-- his truest friend."

989
01:31:33,327 --> 01:31:34,953
[Napoleon breathes shakily]

990
01:31:39,416 --> 01:31:41,251
[sniffling]

991
01:31:54,473 --> 01:31:55,557
[Joséphine] Emperor,

992
01:31:56,391 --> 01:31:59,561
you have just pronounced the word
which separates us forever.

993
01:32:01,396 --> 01:32:03,982
Your mistaken ambition has ever been

994
01:32:04,650 --> 01:32:08,862
and will continue to be the guide
of all your actions.

995
01:32:09,738 --> 01:32:10,948
Nevertheless,

996
01:32:11,740 --> 01:32:15,202
you can never doubt the sincerity
of my wishes for your happiness.

997
01:32:16,453 --> 01:32:20,040
May it at least afford me
some consolation for my sufferings.

998
01:32:21,166 --> 01:32:23,710
-Yours, Joséphine.
-Thank you.

999
01:32:24,378 --> 01:32:26,713
-Good morning, madame.
-Thank you. What's your name?

1000
01:32:26,797 --> 01:32:28,966
-Fleur.
-Fleur. Pleasure.

1001
01:33:20,559 --> 01:33:22,561
[chuckling]

1002
01:33:31,528 --> 01:33:32,529
I miss you.

1003
01:33:37,993 --> 01:33:39,995
Marital life is very agreeable now.

1004
01:33:44,791 --> 01:33:47,377
You've shown such great courage so far.

1005
01:33:47,461 --> 01:33:49,630
[sighs]

1006
01:33:49,713 --> 01:33:51,215
You must maintain it.

1007
01:33:52,633 --> 01:33:55,552
Do not permit yourself
to fall into melancholy.

1008
01:34:01,099 --> 01:34:02,809
You look best when you're happy.

1009
01:34:07,648 --> 01:34:09,233
Please take care of your health.

1010
01:34:10,234 --> 01:34:11,610
It is precious to me.

1011
01:34:12,945 --> 01:34:14,279
Will you write me tomorrow?

1012
01:34:15,072 --> 01:34:16,198
Mm-hmm.

1013
01:34:18,659 --> 01:34:19,785
And the next day?

1014
01:34:20,494 --> 01:34:21,495
Yes.

1015
01:34:22,579 --> 01:34:23,705
And the day after that?

1016
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:26,041
Mm-hmm.

1017
01:34:27,543 --> 01:34:29,378
-And the day after that?
-Yeah.

1018
01:34:32,798 --> 01:34:33,799
Good.

1019
01:34:39,221 --> 01:34:40,222
[kisses]

1020
01:34:41,306 --> 01:34:42,349
[door closes]

1021
01:34:44,059 --> 01:34:47,896
Once, an English ambassador
challenged my reasons for war.

1022
01:34:48,564 --> 01:34:52,025
He said,
"You French, you fight only for money,

1023
01:34:52,109 --> 01:34:54,278
while we English, we fight for honor."

1024
01:34:55,445 --> 01:34:59,116
I replied,
"Everyone fights for what they lack."

1025
01:34:59,867 --> 01:35:02,411
[chuckles, stammers]

1026
01:35:02,494 --> 01:35:05,497
This is not-- This is not your story.
This never happened to you, did it?

1027
01:35:05,581 --> 01:35:06,540
Of course it did.

1028
01:35:06,623 --> 01:35:08,000
-Of course it did.
-What do you mean?

1029
01:35:08,083 --> 01:35:10,169
We had the same saying
with my people and the Turks.

1030
01:35:10,252 --> 01:35:11,461
-[chuckles]
-Do you?

1031
01:35:11,545 --> 01:35:13,630
The English lack honor.
We can agree on that.

1032
01:35:13,714 --> 01:35:16,466
-[Alexander] Listen, there is-- [sighs]
-[mosquito buzzes]

1033
01:35:17,301 --> 01:35:22,222
There's nothing I think we can agree
more with than our hatred for Britain.

1034
01:35:25,559 --> 01:35:30,063
I just have to say that it actually--

1035
01:35:30,147 --> 01:35:33,650
It would be my absolute pleasure
and honor if I could call you my brother.

1036
01:35:37,446 --> 01:35:39,448
There is a way for you to call me brother.

1037
01:35:41,992 --> 01:35:47,039
Last night, at dinner, I was… [sighs]

1038
01:35:47,122 --> 01:35:49,458
…charmed by your sister.

1039
01:35:49,541 --> 01:35:50,918
[chuckles]

1040
01:35:51,001 --> 01:35:52,002
Is she spoken for?

1041
01:35:52,085 --> 01:35:53,921
Ah. Sadly, yes.

1042
01:35:54,004 --> 01:35:57,716
She's to be married
to the Duke of Oldenburg, I'm afraid.

1043
01:35:58,425 --> 01:36:01,386
Uh, and what of her younger sister? Anna?

1044
01:36:01,470 --> 01:36:03,805
[stammers]
Is there a formal offer for Anna?

1045
01:36:03,889 --> 01:36:06,099
-[mosquito buzzes]
-[blows]

1046

[chuckles]

1047
01:36:10,854 --> 01:36:14,399
Uh, well, you see, An-Anna,
she's 15 years old.

1048
01:36:15,609 --> 01:36:16,777
That is a detail.

1049
01:36:16,860 --> 01:36:18,695
[mosquitoes buzzing]

1050
01:36:20,197 --> 01:36:24,785
Our friendship is built on
our mutual distrust of England.

1051
01:36:25,494 --> 01:36:29,873
When we hold to the Continental Blockade,
we choke them from the trade,

1052
01:36:29,957 --> 01:36:32,251
and we fight for our most sacred rights.

1053
01:36:32,334 --> 01:36:34,503
That is what is important between us.

1054
01:36:35,170 --> 01:36:36,171
I just had a thought.

1055
01:36:36,839 --> 01:36:38,131
-No.
-No, say it.

1056
01:36:38,215 --> 01:36:39,842
-Should I tell you?
-Please.

1057
01:36:41,093 --> 01:36:43,846
Imagine an army. 50,000 men.

1058
01:36:44,346 --> 01:36:47,599
Russians, Frenchmen,
perhaps even Austrians,

1059
01:36:47,683 --> 01:36:50,394
marching by way of Constantinople
into Asia

1060
01:36:50,477 --> 01:36:52,145
would have only to reach the Euphrates

1061
01:36:52,229 --> 01:36:54,565
to make England tremble
and bring her down on her knees

1062
01:36:54,648 --> 01:36:56,400
-before the continent.
-[chuckles]

1063
01:36:59,695 --> 01:37:00,863
It is incredible.

1064
01:37:02,072 --> 01:37:03,073

-To you.
-To us.

1067
01:37:12,624 --> 01:37:17,546
His Majesty, the Emperor Napoleon,
wishes to make a formal offer to Austria

1068
01:37:17,629 --> 01:37:19,840
and to His Majesty, King Francis,

1069
01:37:21,049 --> 01:37:24,344
for the hand
of the archduchess, Marie-Louise.

1070
01:37:26,013 --> 01:37:27,139
His eldest daughter.

1071
01:37:28,473 --> 01:37:29,683
No.

1072
01:37:30,726 --> 01:37:33,520
Uh, this union would bring together
Austria and France

1073
01:37:33,604 --> 01:37:35,731
in an unbreakable matrimonial bond.

1074
01:37:37,524 --> 01:37:39,526
[in German] Is this a joke?

1075
01:37:41,904 --> 01:37:48,660
[in German] I may find it humorous…
but His Majesty does not.

1076
01:38:06,553 --> 01:38:08,222
[in English]
Did you have a pleasant journey?

1077
01:38:08,305 --> 01:38:09,848
It was wonderful. Thank you.

1078
01:38:16,021 --> 01:38:17,439
You're quite petite.

1079
01:38:18,482 --> 01:38:19,691
I'm not accustomed to that.

[Marie-Louise chuckles]

1081
01:38:23,570 --> 01:38:24,863
How do I look to you?

1082
01:38:26,490 --> 01:38:28,242
Do I resemble my portrait?

1083
01:38:28,825 --> 01:38:33,163
Oh, yes.
And even more handsome and strong.

1084
01:38:34,456 --> 01:38:37,960
And you are even more handsome,
more be-beautiful.

1085

[chuckles]
I hope you're pleased with your choice.

1086

I hope so too.
Would you like to see the bedroom?

1087

[chuckles] Yes, thank you.

My dear Joséphine, I'm sad today.

1113
01:41:23,625 --> 01:41:27,462
Tsar Alexander has turned against me
and forced me to invade Russia.

1114
01:41:28,422 --> 01:41:33,260
He's decided to open his ports to England
while taxing the French.

1115
01:41:34,595 --> 01:41:38,390
I must wipe away my melancholy
and begin the march to Moscow.

1116
01:41:39,433 --> 01:41:42,311
I've convinced the heads of Europe
of this resolution,

1117
01:41:42,394 --> 01:41:46,899
and so I command the combined forces

-Whoa.

1135
01:43:06,687 --> 01:43:08,313
[horse whinnies]

1136
01:43:14,111 --> 01:43:17,781
-Get back! Drop back. Retreat.
-[grunts] Fall back!

1137
01:43:17,865 --> 01:43:19,867
[soldiers shouting]

1138
01:44:25,182 --> 01:44:27,100
[Napoleon] My dear Joséphine.

1139
01:44:28,685 --> 01:44:31,939
I'm writing to you because I have just won
a great battle today.

1140
01:44:33,565 --> 01:44:35,859
Tomorrow we will resume our advance.

1141
01:44:36,568 --> 01:44:38,946
Moscow is now only 200 miles away.

1142
01:44:39,029 --> 01:44:42,491
And I think of you all the while.
All yours.

1143
01:44:43,200 --> 01:44:45,035
[French soldier 1]
Nearly there. Nearly there.

1144
01:44:52,459 --> 01:44:54,878
-[French soldier 2] Thank you, sir.
-[speaks indistinctly]

1145
01:44:55,671 --> 01:44:57,130
[soldier coughing]

1146
01:45:00,551 --> 01:45:03,470
-Thank you, Admiral.
-You were the brave of Austerlitz.

1147
01:45:31,790 --> 01:45:33,792
[dogs barking]

1148
01:46:06,200 --> 01:46:08,410
[dogs barking]

1149
01:46:08,493 --> 01:46:10,037
[Napoleon shouting] Where are you?

1150
01:46:23,133 --> 01:46:25,427
300,000 souls lived in this city.

1151
01:46:27,304 --> 01:46:28,680
And they've all just left?

1152
01:46:47,866 --> 01:46:50,786
Little boy.

1153
01:46:50,869 --> 01:46:54,248
Pspspsps.

1154
01:46:55,999 --> 01:46:57,543
Where are you?

1155
01:47:02,005 --> 01:47:03,632
Don't be frightened.

1156
01:47:04,466 --> 01:47:06,677
I'm just gonna give you a little spanking.

1157
01:47:37,541 --> 01:47:39,042
It's not very sporting, is it?

1158
01:47:40,919 --> 01:47:42,796
For his honor and Russia's, not mine.

1159
01:47:48,218 --> 01:47:50,179
There's dignity to be had in defeat.

1160
01:47:52,639 --> 01:47:54,641
[snoring]

1161
01:47:54,725 --> 01:47:56,268
[fire crackling]

1162
01:47:56,351 --> 01:47:58,812
[gasps, breathing heavily]

1163
01:48:33,847 --> 01:48:34,848
Who did this?

1164
01:48:36,266 --> 01:48:37,267
They did.

1165
01:48:38,769 --> 01:48:41,980
No, they did not. Be sensible.

1166
01:48:44,900 --> 01:48:48,028
-Who set these fires?
-[sighs]

1167
01:48:48,111 --> 01:48:51,532
Your Majesty, they did.

1168
01:48:55,369 --> 01:48:56,537
[sighs]

1169
01:48:57,162 --> 01:49:00,123
He'd rather burn his own city
than negotiate with me.

1170
01:49:00,916 --> 01:49:02,960
I didn't think he had the courage.

1171
01:49:08,423 --> 01:49:13,971
Well, we'll go to Saint Petersburg
and have him burn that too.

1172
01:49:15,848 --> 01:49:19,393
We have let too much time slip away.

1173
01:49:21,103 --> 01:49:24,481
We would be marching
into the Russian winter

1174
01:49:25,440 --> 01:49:29,486
with horses that are not raised
for this weather.

1175
01:49:31,029 --> 01:49:34,283
If we go back to Poland,
we can wait out the winter months.

1176
01:49:36,869 --> 01:49:37,828
Hmm?

1177
01:49:37,911 --> 01:49:39,121
[shouts]

1178
01:49:49,798 --> 01:49:53,302
[Joséphine] Napoleon, your letters
are a soothing balm to my heart.

1179
01:49:54,219 --> 01:49:55,512
I fear for you.

1180
01:49:56,263 --> 01:49:58,432
Remember that I alone know your health…

1181
01:49:58,515 --> 01:49:59,975
-[spits]
-…your fears.

1182
01:50:00,767 --> 01:50:04,313
I thank you as tenderly
as I will always love you.

1183
01:50:04,855 --> 01:50:05,898
Joséphine.

1184
01:50:07,566 --> 01:50:09,151
[Napoleon] My friend, Joséphine.

1185
01:50:10,319 --> 01:50:11,486
"Friend."

1186
01:50:12,571 --> 01:50:14,740
It is strange to write that word to you.

1187
01:50:15,991 --> 01:50:17,993
You have always been so much more.

1188
01:50:18,076 --> 01:50:20,078
[soldiers coughing]

1189
01:50:20,162 --> 01:50:22,581
[fife playing]

1190
01:50:26,084 --> 01:50:30,881
[Napoleon] Despite careful organization,
there have been breakdowns in supply.

1191
01:50:32,466 --> 01:50:37,262
We're suffering sickness,
desertion and famine.

1192
01:50:39,306 --> 01:50:40,432
We are winning.

1193
01:50:40,516 --> 01:50:42,518
[soldiers coughing]

1194
01:50:52,653 --> 01:50:55,989
-[Napoleon] Us or Cossacks?
-[French general] Us.

1195
01:50:59,201 --> 01:51:03,830
[Napoleon sighs] Joséphine.
Fortune has abandoned me.

1196
01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:07,709
I know that it is what fate has for me.

1197
01:51:08,418 --> 01:51:10,587
Your words rattle in my head.

1198
01:51:12,256 --> 01:51:14,258
I am nothing without you.

1199
01:51:18,595 --> 01:51:22,266
[politician]
Of the 600,000 men you sent to Russia,

1200
01:51:22,349 --> 01:51:25,227
only 40,000 have returned.

1201
01:51:25,310 --> 01:51:30,941
Therefore, you have been exiled
in no uncertain terms.

1202
01:51:32,734 --> 01:51:37,698
The allied coalition of Austria, Prussia,
Russia and England,

1203
01:51:39,491 --> 01:51:41,785
and with the agreement
of the French Council,

1204
01:51:42,995 --> 01:51:46,748
grant you sovereignty
of the island of Elba.

1205
01:51:48,500 --> 01:51:51,587
A revenue of two million francs
from the French funds,

1206
01:51:52,588 --> 01:51:56,008
pensions for the Bonaparte family
and the Empress Marie-Louise.

1207
01:51:57,176 --> 01:52:02,389
It also provides for Empress Joséphine
to retain all of her properties

1208
01:52:03,891 --> 01:52:07,728
and an allotted annual income
of one million francs.

1209
01:52:09,730 --> 01:52:11,398
[sighs]

1210
01:52:36,840 --> 01:52:38,425
I love France too much.

1211
01:52:43,680 --> 01:52:45,933
All I've desired was its glory.

1212
01:52:48,727 --> 01:52:50,687
I would never bring her misfortune.

1213
01:52:53,190 --> 01:52:56,401
They want me to abdicate. [sighs]

1214
01:52:56,485 --> 01:52:58,028
Fine, I'll abdicate.

1215
01:53:13,293 --> 01:53:15,295
[townsfolk chattering in Italian]

1216
01:54:04,845 --> 01:54:05,846
Your Highness.

1217
01:54:07,598 --> 01:54:08,599
Empress.

1218
01:54:23,655 --> 01:54:24,656
[Joséphine] Here.

1219
01:54:29,536 --> 01:54:32,164
[Alexander] Joséphine, Joséphine. Hmm?

1220
01:54:32,915 --> 01:54:34,416
[chuckles] I am charmed.

1221
01:54:36,502 --> 01:54:39,713
But… [sighs]

1222
01:54:42,049 --> 01:54:46,303
…you do not have to lock yourself away
just because he's not here.

1223
01:54:48,055 --> 01:54:50,432
I know what it is like
to be underestimated.

1224
01:54:52,059 --> 01:54:58,065
But your eyes, your charm and your spirit,

1225
01:54:59,274 --> 01:55:00,484
it is in there.

1226
01:55:01,318 --> 01:55:04,863
It is yours, and you can use it.

1227
01:55:09,076 --> 01:55:11,620
[classical music playing]

1228
01:55:48,907 --> 01:55:50,242
[Napoleon] Dear Joséphine,

1229
01:55:50,993 --> 01:55:54,079
You are mine. You will always be.

1230
01:55:55,622 --> 01:55:58,166
-I cannot stand it any longer.
-[crew member shouting]

1231
01:55:58,250 --> 01:56:00,502
It has been 300 days on this rock,

1232
01:56:01,170 --> 01:56:04,548
and I'm ready to come home
and reclaim what's mine:

1233
01:56:05,174 --> 01:56:06,967
you and France.

1234
01:56:18,979 --> 01:56:21,815
[crew members shouting]

1235
01:56:25,152 --> 01:56:26,904
[Napoleon] I'm taking your ship.

1236
01:56:26,987 --> 01:56:29,865
If you do not provoke me,
you do not have to fear me.

1237
01:56:48,926 --> 01:56:50,135
[Joséphine] Napoleon,

1238
01:56:51,094 --> 01:56:55,307
I'm a flower that opens its petals
and smiles to the sunshine,

1239
01:56:56,433 --> 01:56:59,937
unconscious that the storm is near
which will lay me low

1240
01:57:00,020 --> 01:57:03,106
-and scatter leaves to the heavens.
-[groans]

1241
01:57:03,190 --> 01:57:05,192
Come quickly, my friend.

1242
01:57:17,788 --> 01:57:19,248
[kisses]

1243
01:57:33,762 --> 01:57:37,182
-[wheezing]
-If you would open your mouth, please.

1244
01:57:37,975 --> 01:57:40,018
[groaning]

1245
01:57:42,437 --> 01:57:43,438
Thank you.

1246
01:57:48,360 --> 01:57:49,570
Thank you.

1247
01:57:50,362 --> 01:57:53,699
Well, your chest is congested.
Your throat is aflame.

1248
01:57:54,867 --> 01:57:56,702
My suggestion is to stay in bed.

1249
01:57:57,536 --> 01:58:00,497
[wheezing] But Napoleon is coming.

1250
01:58:01,039 --> 01:58:03,792
It would be unwise
to receive any visitors.

1251
01:58:03,876 --> 01:58:05,502
But Napoleon is coming.

1252
01:58:05,586 --> 01:58:06,670
I understand.

1253
01:58:19,725 --> 01:58:21,727
[wheezing]

1254
01:58:26,231 --> 01:58:28,192
[Dr. Corvisart] Just keep her comfortable.

1255
01:58:48,003 --> 01:58:49,046
Whoa, whoa!

1256
01:58:56,094 --> 01:58:57,179
Your Majesty.

1257
01:59:02,017 --> 01:59:03,310
You may speak.

1258
01:59:03,393 --> 01:59:06,563
Bonaparte, Your Majesty. He has returned.

1259
01:59:06,647 --> 01:59:08,690
A ship landed on a beach
in Antibes this morning,

1260
01:59:08,774 --> 01:59:09,650
and they're on the march.

1261
01:59:09,733 --> 01:59:12,778
Napoleon Bonaparte is marching
towards Paris.

1262
01:59:12,861 --> 01:59:16,073
[breathing heavily]

1263
01:59:16,156 --> 01:59:17,449
More.

1264
01:59:17,533 --> 01:59:18,534
Your Majesty.

1265
01:59:51,942 --> 01:59:52,818
Afternoon, Colonel.

1266
01:59:53,861 --> 01:59:55,070
[colonel] Your Majesty.

1267
01:59:55,654 --> 01:59:56,738
General Marchand,

1268
01:59:56,822 --> 01:59:59,408
in defense of the royal government
of King Louis XVIII,

1269
02:00:00,200 --> 02:00:03,245
requests that you surrender your weapons
and cease your march

1270
02:00:03,954 --> 02:00:06,623
so that you may be arrested
and returned to your island.

1271
02:00:07,666 --> 02:00:11,545
Will you please inform the general that
I shall like to come and speak with him?

1272
02:00:13,255 --> 02:00:15,257
I have no fight with my own Fifth Army.

1273
02:00:17,050 --> 02:00:18,051
Sir.

1274
02:00:27,102 --> 02:00:28,562
He wishes to speak.

1275
02:00:30,063 --> 02:00:31,064
Make ready!

1276
02:00:34,818 --> 02:00:36,028
Present.

1277
02:00:47,039 --> 02:00:52,002
Soldiers of the Fifth Regiment,
do you recognize me?

1278
02:00:55,797 --> 02:00:57,925
Do you recognize me, soldiers?

1279
02:00:59,843 --> 02:01:01,428
[French soldier] Yes, Emperor!

1280
02:01:01,512 --> 02:01:04,556
[laughing]

1281
02:01:07,643 --> 02:01:08,852
[Napoleon] I miss you.

1282
02:01:11,605 --> 02:01:13,607
I'm melancholy for my home…

1283
02:01:15,901 --> 02:01:18,070
and for our victories together.

1284
02:01:21,281 --> 02:01:22,783
I want to come home.

1285
02:01:24,243 --> 02:01:25,536
Will you join me?

1286
02:01:27,287 --> 02:01:29,039
Long live the emperor!

1287
02:01:29,122 --> 02:01:32,334
-Long live the emperor!
-Long live the emperor!

1288
02:01:32,417 --> 02:01:36,547
-Long live the emperor!
-Long live the emperor!

1289
02:01:36,630 --> 02:01:39,049
-[pledging continues]
-[cheering]

1290
02:01:48,851 --> 02:01:50,853
[crying]

1291
02:02:16,545 --> 02:02:21,466
On May 26th, Dr. Corvisart was called

1292
02:02:22,759 --> 02:02:27,931
and found her chest congested
and her throat inflamed.

1293
02:02:30,309 --> 02:02:32,811
Her illness was diphtheria.

1294
02:02:35,898 --> 02:02:41,778
On May 29th, last sacrament was given,
and she died.

1295
02:02:46,408 --> 02:02:48,285
And no one thought to notify me?

1296
02:02:54,082 --> 02:02:55,292
[sighs]

1297
02:02:58,587 --> 02:02:59,588
Hortense.

1298
02:03:02,508 --> 02:03:05,260
Do you blame-- [breathes shakily]

1299
02:03:05,344 --> 02:03:06,553
Do you blame me?

1300
02:03:08,847 --> 02:03:10,390
-[sniffles]
-I don't blame you.

1301
02:03:10,474 --> 02:03:11,475
Of course not.

1302
02:03:14,353 --> 02:03:19,233
I'm not to bear the burden
of responsibility… [breathes shakily]

1303
02:03:19,316 --> 02:03:21,235
…for the misfortunes of your mother.

1304
02:03:22,361 --> 02:03:24,446
I want the letters that I wrote to her.
[sniffles]

1305
02:03:24,530 --> 02:03:28,575
I'm sorry, I don't have them.
They were stolen by her valet.

1306
02:03:30,118 --> 02:03:31,286
[blows]

1307
02:03:31,370 --> 02:03:32,579
Where did she keep them?

1308
02:03:34,957 --> 02:03:37,459
In the cupboard in her bedroom,
next to her bed.

1309
02:03:41,088 --> 02:03:42,506
What did he do with them?

1310
02:03:44,925 --> 02:03:46,510
Her valet sold them.

1311
02:03:52,933 --> 02:03:54,893
-[cries]
-[Hortense] I'm sorry.

1312
02:03:57,855 --> 02:03:58,856
I forgive you.

1313
02:04:03,652 --> 02:04:06,780
[congress member]
Napoleon Bonaparte has destroyed

1314
02:04:06,864 --> 02:04:10,742
the only title
upon which his very existence depended.

1315
02:04:12,160 --> 02:04:15,497
This congregation of allies shall form

1316
02:04:15,581 --> 02:04:19,042
along the borders of France
and Belgium an army.

1317
02:04:19,126 --> 02:04:21,795
70,000 troops from England,

1318
02:04:23,130 --> 02:04:25,716
120,000 troops from Prussia.

1319
02:04:27,801 --> 02:04:31,763
This vermin has routed
the farmyards of Europe

1320
02:04:32,639 --> 02:04:34,808
while the farmers snored.

1321
02:04:35,392 --> 02:04:37,603
We should have struck this blow long ago.

1322
02:04:38,687 --> 02:04:43,025
He has held the world hostage
with his egotism,

1323
02:04:43,108 --> 02:04:46,320
his insatiable hunger for power,

1324
02:04:46,403 --> 02:04:49,823
and his lack of simple good manners.

1325
02:04:50,782 --> 02:04:53,243
We will all sleep again without him.

1326
02:04:54,411 --> 02:04:59,541
I believe I speak for all of us when I say
that the only regret we all share

1327
02:05:00,250 --> 02:05:03,670
is that we allowed this vermin
to live at all.

1328
02:05:04,838 --> 02:05:08,467
250,000 men with the traitor.

1329
02:05:09,676 --> 02:05:15,641
25,000 men, 125,000 men

1330
02:05:15,724 --> 02:05:18,393
and 100,000 men…

1331
02:05:21,897 --> 02:05:25,234
against our 125,000 men.

1332
02:05:27,694 --> 02:05:29,279
This is a fight on land.

1333
02:05:30,948 --> 02:05:33,951
This is what Britain does not know
how to do that I know.

1334
02:05:36,245 --> 02:05:40,332
Strike quickly
against Wellington and Blücher.

1335
02:05:41,124 --> 02:05:42,709
Defeat them separately.

1336
02:05:43,752 --> 02:05:47,172
Disallow them from uniting forces here.

1337
02:06:00,227 --> 02:06:01,436
Morning.

1338
02:06:01,520 --> 02:06:03,522
-Morning.
-[grunts]

1339
02:06:03,605 --> 02:06:05,065
The Prussians are advancing.

1340
02:06:06,149 --> 02:06:07,651
We should begin the offensive.

1341
02:06:08,360 --> 02:06:10,445
[Napoleon]
We must wait for the ground to dry.

1342
02:06:12,948 --> 02:06:16,243
Blücher will never make it in time.
I'll have Wellington by lunch.

1343
02:06:23,667 --> 02:06:26,837
[thunder rumbling]

1344
02:06:28,797 --> 02:06:30,215
[sighs, grunts]

1345
02:06:32,176 --> 02:06:33,594
[clears throat]

1346
02:06:39,057 --> 02:06:42,269
I never get wet if I can help it.
[clears throat]

1347
02:07:28,357 --> 02:07:31,276
[thunder rumbling]

1348
02:07:47,960 --> 02:07:49,336
What shall I tell the men?

1349
02:07:51,380 --> 02:07:53,090
Tell them to make the rain stop.

1350
02:07:56,093 --> 02:08:00,430
-[British soldier 1] Coming through!
-[British soldier 2] In formation!

1351
02:08:01,890 --> 02:08:04,560
[Wellesley]
Now's your time, lads. Now's your time.

1352
02:08:05,894 --> 02:08:07,521
Now, listen very carefully.

1353
02:08:08,981 --> 02:08:13,902
Patience is the order of the day today.
Patience shall win the day.

1354
02:08:14,653 --> 02:08:16,905
We must hold this ground.

1355
02:08:17,614 --> 02:08:19,408
Let them come to us.

1356
02:08:19,491 --> 02:08:21,326
[soldiers] Huzzah!

1357
02:08:26,665 --> 02:08:27,916
Go on, boys. Go on.

1358
02:08:30,085 --> 02:08:31,086
Whoa.

1359
02:08:31,879 --> 02:08:33,088
Good morning, General Blücher.

1360
02:08:33,172 --> 02:08:35,799
-Good morning.
-Estimated time of arrival, sir?

1361
02:08:35,883 --> 02:08:38,218
-Officer?
-About five hours.

1362
02:08:38,302 --> 02:08:39,887
About five hours.

1363
02:08:56,445 --> 02:08:57,821
Come on, boys. Come on, boys.

1364
02:08:59,072 --> 02:09:00,073
[grunts]

1365
02:09:02,826 --> 02:09:04,828
[soldier shouting, distant]

1366
02:09:10,375 --> 02:09:11,668
Oh, there he is.

1367
02:09:12,586 --> 02:09:18,258
He appears to be… [chuckles]
…just sleeping.

1368
02:09:19,718 --> 02:09:25,140
One thing you cannot resist, my friend,
is a frontal attack.

1369
02:09:28,060 --> 02:09:31,063
Let's see how this general
can attack our position.

1370
02:09:34,066 --> 02:09:38,904
Sir. I have the emperor in my sights.
Do I have permission to fire?

1371
02:09:38,987 --> 02:09:40,113
Certainly not.

1372
02:09:40,614 --> 02:09:42,908
Generals commanding armies
have better things to do with their time

1373
02:09:42,991 --> 02:09:44,034
than to shoot at one another.

1374
02:09:44,117 --> 02:09:46,578
Hold your fire, rifleman,
on pain of death.

1375
02:09:46,662 --> 02:09:48,455
Go on, boys. Come, come.

1376
02:09:48,539 --> 02:09:50,332
[British soldier] A runner coming through!

1377
02:09:51,834 --> 02:09:53,502
Blücher, 11 to 12 miles, sir.

1378
02:09:54,336 --> 02:09:56,171
[British general 1] Attention, follow me.

1379
02:09:56,672 --> 02:09:59,216
-Blücher at 11 to 12 miles, sir.
-Jesus Christ.

1380
02:09:59,299 --> 02:10:01,385
-I want a report every hour.
-Yes, sir.

1381
02:10:04,179 --> 02:10:07,850
[French soldier]
Runner coming through. Make way.

1382
02:10:07,933 --> 02:10:10,853
Oh. Oh.

1383
02:10:12,437 --> 02:10:15,357
[panting]
Prussians on the roadside, 12 miles.

1384
02:10:21,613 --> 02:10:25,492
Prussian troops have been sighted
on the road, sire. Twelve miles.

1385
02:10:29,121 --> 02:10:30,330
Ready the cannons.

1386
02:10:33,959 --> 02:10:35,627
Ready the cannons!

1387
02:10:35,711 --> 02:10:38,714
[French soldiers clamoring]

1388
02:10:38,797 --> 02:10:40,841
[French general] Go on! Move!

1389
02:10:46,221 --> 02:10:49,516
[French soldiers shouting]

1390
02:10:50,267 --> 02:10:52,853
[French soldier 1]
Ready! Cannons are ready!

1391
02:10:52,936 --> 02:10:54,813
[French soldier 2] Cannons are ready!

1392
02:10:54,897 --> 02:10:56,607
[French general]
The rain has stopped, sir.

1393
02:11:05,532 --> 02:11:07,242
Prepare to fire!

1394
02:11:10,662 --> 02:11:12,247
[breathes heavily]

1395
02:11:16,877 --> 02:11:19,463
-Fire!
-[French soldiers] Fire!

1396
02:11:25,469 --> 02:11:27,012
[British general 2] Take cover!

1397
02:11:29,806 --> 02:11:32,142
Straight into position. Steady.

1398
02:11:32,226 --> 02:11:36,313
Prepare for the advance. Get ready.

1399
02:11:37,648 --> 02:11:39,107
Prepare for the advance.

1400
02:11:39,191 --> 02:11:41,276
Readjust to 195!

1401
02:11:41,360 --> 02:11:43,403
Adjust 195!

1402
02:11:43,487 --> 02:11:46,156
[French soldier] Elevation 195.

1403

Adjusted!

1404
02:11:52,287 --> 02:11:55,165
Prepare to fire! Fire!

[French soldiers] Fire!

1406
02:11:59,169 --> 02:12:01,797
[British soldiers shouting, screaming]

1407
02:12:01,880 --> 02:12:05,008
[British general 2]
Keep your head down. Seventh, take over.

1408
02:12:11,598 --> 02:12:13,809
[screaming]

1409

-[British soldier] Out the way!
-[British general 3] Hold fast, men!

[French general]
Second wave, advance! Over the top, men!

-Fire!

[British general 2] Fire!

1424
02:13:17,539 --> 02:13:19,666
[British general 3]
You there, get on that cannon.

[soldiers shouting]

Keep them back, men. Fire.

Whoa, whoa.

Prussians, roadside, five miles.

1441

[French general] Five miles, maybe less.

1442
02:14:33,365 --> 02:14:35,033
We have to act before Blücher arrives.

1443
02:14:35,701 --> 02:14:36,702
Out.

1444

[soldiers shouting]

Stand fast to the last man.

02:15:21,496 --> 02:15:23,749
We must not be beat!

1453
02:15:24,541 --> 02:15:26,793
Or what will they say in England?

1454
02:15:26,877 --> 02:15:30,047
-[British general] Hold the line.
-[British soldier] Keep it tight.

1455
02:15:30,130 --> 02:15:33,008
[soldiers shouting]

1456
02:15:34,384 --> 02:15:37,888
[British general]
Steady, men. Stay in formation.

1457
02:15:41,308 --> 02:15:43,685
[French soldier] Long live the emperor!

1458
02:15:46,021 --> 02:15:47,940
[British general] Company, halt!

1459
02:15:48,607 --> 02:15:51,985
[British general 2]
Form square! Form square!

1460
02:16:02,246 --> 02:16:04,915
[shouting, clamoring]

1461
02:16:07,626 --> 02:16:10,212
[French general] Long live the emperor!

1462
02:16:13,298 --> 02:16:16,969
[British general] One section, fire.
Two section, fire.

1463
02:16:17,928 --> 02:16:20,681
[soldiers shouting, grunting]

1464
02:16:27,646 --> 02:16:28,522
[screams]

1465
02:16:30,482 --> 02:16:31,483
[grunts]

1466
02:16:33,360 --> 02:16:36,280
[French general] What do we do, sir?
We can't break through.

1467
02:16:36,361 --> 02:16:38,824
[British general] Keep them running.
Get in back with the square.

1468
02:16:41,535 --> 02:16:43,120
Show them your British steel.

1469
02:16:46,748 --> 02:16:49,709
[breathing heavily]

1470
02:16:54,798 --> 02:16:56,758
[French general] Present arms!

1471
02:16:58,135 --> 02:16:59,136
[huffs]

1472
02:17:00,468 --> 02:17:01,805
Shoulder, hold!

1473
02:17:06,393 --> 02:17:08,145
-They're here, the Prussians.
-[grunts]

1474
02:17:11,022 --> 02:17:12,900
-[grunts]
-First over the rise, Emperor.

1475
02:17:12,983 --> 02:17:14,691
[panting]

1476
02:17:28,999 --> 02:17:31,293
[soldiers shouting]

1477
02:17:38,924 --> 02:17:41,011
[French soldier 1]
We need to find a way through!

1478
02:17:43,847 --> 02:17:45,849
[French soldier 2]
Break the square. Break the square!

1479
02:17:46,975 --> 02:17:48,602
[screams]

1480
02:17:50,145 --> 02:17:51,772
[clamoring]

1481
02:17:56,485 --> 02:17:57,778
[Napoleon] Charge bayonets.

1482
02:17:58,654 --> 02:18:00,489
[French general] Charge bayonets!

1483
02:18:02,574 --> 02:18:07,120
Your Emperor is with you.
You are the brave of Austerlitz.

1484
02:18:07,995 --> 02:18:09,540
Never surrender.

1485
02:18:10,374 --> 02:18:12,876
For homeland and glory!

1486
02:18:19,758 --> 02:18:22,511
[British general] Shoulder to shoulder!
Form lines!

1487
02:18:22,593 --> 02:18:24,263
[British general 2] Shoulder to shoulder.

1488
02:18:25,638 --> 02:18:27,724
[soldiers shouting]

1489
02:18:29,101 --> 02:18:29,977
[exclaims]

1490
02:18:31,227 --> 02:18:32,521
Infantry, advance.

1491
02:18:33,021 --> 02:18:38,861
-Battalion! [indistinct] Advance!
-[sighs]

1492
02:18:44,531 --> 02:18:45,909
[French general] Keep the line!

1493
02:18:48,201 --> 02:18:50,414
[British general] Footmen, fire!

1494
02:18:54,334 --> 02:18:56,420
Second line, fire.

1495
02:19:00,340 --> 02:19:01,717
Prepare to charge!

1496
02:19:04,136 --> 02:19:05,512
Charge!

1497
02:19:10,767 --> 02:19:12,269
[soldiers shouting]

1498
02:19:12,352 --> 02:19:14,062
[British general] Go on! Batter them!

1499
02:19:16,481 --> 02:19:18,650
[British general 2] Advance! Advance!

1500
02:19:30,913 --> 02:19:32,120
Cavalry advance, sir?

1501
02:19:33,373 --> 02:19:34,665
Cavalry advance.

1502
02:19:35,250 --> 02:19:37,669
[British general]
Prepare for counterattack.

1503
02:19:37,753 --> 02:19:42,508
Men, enter. Full support.

1504
02:19:42,591 --> 02:19:45,177
[shouting]

1505
02:19:55,604 --> 02:19:56,605
[screams]

1506
02:19:57,105 --> 02:19:58,690
[screaming]

1507
02:19:59,399 --> 02:20:01,318
[soldiers screaming, grunting]

1508
02:20:11,078 --> 02:20:13,288
[grunting]

1509
02:20:17,459 --> 02:20:21,255
No. He can't help himself.

1510
02:20:22,506 --> 02:20:24,216
[British general] Sir, Blücher.

1511
02:20:30,931 --> 02:20:31,932
Thank God.

1512
02:20:32,432 --> 02:20:37,396
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

1513
02:20:38,730 --> 02:20:41,608
Come see how masse de la France dines!

1514
02:20:41,692 --> 02:20:44,278
Yeah! Hyah!

1515
02:20:44,361 --> 02:20:45,487
[pants]

1516
02:20:46,280 --> 02:20:48,198
[gunshot fires]

1517
02:21:10,470 --> 02:21:12,764
Yeah! Yeah!

1518
02:21:14,099 --> 02:21:16,268
[soldiers struggling]

1519
02:21:19,605 --> 02:21:20,898
[shouting, screaming]

1520
02:21:47,216 --> 02:21:51,678
The battle is mine.
There will be an end to the war.

1521
02:21:57,893 --> 02:21:59,228
[whistle blowing]

1522
02:21:59,311 --> 02:22:01,146
[British general] Senior officer, on deck!

1523
02:22:03,690 --> 02:22:05,567
Good day, good day, good day.

1524
02:22:08,820 --> 02:22:14,201
I am the first to admit
when I make a mistake. But I never do.

1525
02:22:14,284 --> 02:22:16,119
Because it is geometry.

1526
02:22:17,579 --> 02:22:19,957
I simply know
precisely where to place a cannon.

1527
02:22:21,500 --> 02:22:26,213
But tragically I cannot transfer
this knowledge to my marshals. [sighs]

1528
02:22:27,297 --> 02:22:30,509
That might be
what is most difficult in life.

1529
02:22:32,469 --> 02:22:34,137
Accepting the failures of others.

1530
02:22:35,222 --> 02:22:36,473
You must not do that.

1531
02:22:38,934 --> 02:22:40,269
Encourage greatness.

1532
02:22:45,607 --> 02:22:47,818
-Mind your head, sir.
-[Wellesley grunts]

1533
02:22:49,653 --> 02:22:51,405
[British general] Mind your head, sir.

1534
02:22:58,537 --> 02:23:01,623
-What are they doing there?
-Sir, it's the midshipmen. They adore him.

1535
02:23:01,707 --> 02:23:02,791
Well, get 'em out.

1536
02:23:02,875 --> 02:23:04,793
Clear the room. Uh, quickly.

1537
02:23:21,185 --> 02:23:23,228
-Your grace--
-Good morning, General.

1538
02:23:23,312 --> 02:23:24,605
These boys are delightful.

1539
02:23:26,523 --> 02:23:27,816
May I sit down?

1540
02:23:27,900 --> 02:23:28,901
Please.

1541
02:23:28,984 --> 02:23:31,486
[clears throat, sniffs]
And this breakfast.

1542
02:23:32,487 --> 02:23:36,867
Now I know why you have
such a successful navy. Thank you.

1543
02:23:37,659 --> 02:23:40,287
-[grunts]
-[Wellesley clears throat]

1544
02:23:42,748 --> 02:23:45,125
I've never visited
the English countryside.

1545
02:23:45,209 --> 02:23:47,085
I imagine I'll love the Cotswolds…

1546
02:23:50,547 --> 02:23:53,634
-soft flowing hills, gentle light.
-[sighs]

1547
02:23:55,594 --> 02:23:59,973
Uh, my dear sir,
it is only by a narrow margin of opinion

1548
02:24:00,057 --> 02:24:02,267
that you have been spared the fate
of being shot.

1549
02:24:02,351 --> 02:24:03,435
[scoffs]

1550
02:24:03,519 --> 02:24:06,271
[chuckles]
Politically, I'm afraid it's impossible

1551
02:24:06,355 --> 02:24:09,775
for the British government
to allow you to stay in England.

1552
02:24:11,860 --> 02:24:14,905
You are permitted three officers
and 12 servants

1553
02:24:14,988 --> 02:24:17,199
to accompany you into exile.

1554
02:24:18,033 --> 02:24:21,703
Exile will be contained to the island
of Saint Helena

1555
02:24:21,787 --> 02:24:26,375
under the watchful eye
of Governor Hudson Lowe and his family.

1556
02:24:26,458 --> 02:24:27,459
[grunts]

1557
02:24:28,710 --> 02:24:29,711
Saint…

1558
02:24:30,921 --> 02:24:34,341
Helena. It's a small island.

1559
02:24:34,424 --> 02:24:36,802
[chuckles] More of a rock, really.

1560
02:24:37,845 --> 02:24:40,597
A thousand miles
from the mainland of Africa.

1561
02:24:41,348 --> 02:24:45,853
I'm told it's very pretty, tranquil.
You'll have time to reflect.

1562
02:24:47,563 --> 02:24:49,731
Your correspondence will be monitored,

1563
02:24:49,815 --> 02:24:53,360
your presence verified twice daily
by the orderly officer.

1564
02:25:03,620 --> 02:25:06,874
[crew member] Fix that rigging line.
Draw up the sails.

1565
02:25:08,458 --> 02:25:09,793
Go below deck!

1566
02:25:15,048 --> 02:25:16,466
[crew shouting]

1567
02:25:18,927 --> 02:25:23,265
[Joséphine] What will you do now?
I hate to see you alone.

1568
02:25:24,641 --> 02:25:29,438
Will you come to me? Will I forgive you?

1569
02:25:31,106 --> 02:25:33,525
My sweet, stubborn Emperor.

1570
02:25:34,610 --> 02:25:37,196
I let you loose and let you come to ruin.

1571
02:25:38,530 --> 02:25:41,742
Next time, I will be Emperor,

1572
02:25:41,825 --> 02:25:43,744
and you will do as I say.

1573
02:25:51,001 --> 02:25:53,712
[Napoleon] Well, you were right.

1574
02:25:55,130 --> 02:25:57,674
Every night I beg to see you in my dreams.

1575
02:25:58,592 --> 02:26:01,887
And when I do, you turn me away.

1576
02:26:22,449 --> 02:26:25,327
-[soldiers chattering]
-[children laughing]

1577
02:26:34,336 --> 02:26:36,296
Girls, what's the capital of France?

1578
02:26:38,841 --> 02:26:39,842
Paris.

1579
02:26:40,551 --> 02:26:41,552
And Russia?

1580
02:26:42,261 --> 02:26:44,513
Petersburg. And Moscow before.

1581
02:26:46,473 --> 02:26:50,894
Moscow.
And who burnt Moscow to the ground?

1582
02:26:55,315 --> 02:26:56,316
I don't know, sir.

1583
02:26:57,776 --> 02:26:58,777
I did.

1584
02:26:59,570 --> 02:27:03,407
I believe, sir, the Russians burnt it
to get rid of the French.

1585
02:27:03,907 --> 02:27:04,908
Who told you that?

1586
02:27:05,701 --> 02:27:07,160
It's common knowledge, sir.

1587
02:27:10,038 --> 02:27:11,164
[children chuckle]

1588
02:27:11,248 --> 02:27:13,542
Go. Go play.

1589
02:27:15,127 --> 02:27:16,128
[child] En garde.

1590
02:27:19,423 --> 02:27:22,009
[Joséphine] Can I tell you
what I have waiting for you?

1591
02:27:22,092 --> 02:27:23,343
[children laughing]

1592
02:27:24,178 --> 02:27:28,390
It is a secret.
And I will show you when you arrive.

1593
02:27:31,977 --> 02:27:37,316
Come to me, Napoleon.
And let's try this again.
