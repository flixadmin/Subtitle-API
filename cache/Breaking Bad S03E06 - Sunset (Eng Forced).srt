1
00:31:30,264 --> 00:31:32,139
What can I do for you?

2
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:36,519
You know.

3
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:41,649
Sunset.

4
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:00,405
I toId you before.

5
00:45:00,907 --> 00:45:03,742
You wiIl not kill Walter White.

6
00:45:04,452 --> 00:45:08,080
Not until my business with him has concluded.

7
00:45:08,748 --> 00:45:10,749
We've waited long enough.

8
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:13,460
We won't wait any longer.

9
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:16,755
You'll have to.

10
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:18,632
The decision...

11
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:20,926
...is not yours to make.

12
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:28,934
Explain to me, why this man White?

13
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:33,740
He betrayed your cousin Tuco, yes.

14
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:39,486
But he's not the one who murdered him.

15
00:45:40,814 --> 00:45:42,439
Was there not another man...

16
00:45:42,949 --> 00:45:45,283
...who pulled the trigger?

17
00:45:46,077 --> 00:45:47,911
A DEA agent.

18
00:45:48,621 --> 00:45:51,123
Bolsa says the DEA is off-limits.

19
00:45:52,625 --> 00:45:55,460
North of the border is my territory.

20
00:45:55,962 --> 00:45:57,379
My say.

21
00:45:59,966 --> 00:46:01,800
As a show of respect...

22
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:04,136
...l say yes.

23
00:46:13,938 --> 00:46:17,190
The agent's name is...

24
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:19,276
...Hank Schrader.

25
00:46:22,822 --> 00:46:26,783
May his death satisfy you.
