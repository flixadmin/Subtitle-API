00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:12,708
<i>In the summer of 1973,
a few miles outside of Austin, Texas,</i>

2
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:16,125
<i>five youths were attacked
in a grisly and gruesome fashion</i>

3
00:01:16,208 --> 00:01:18,583
<i>by an unidentified madman.</i>

4
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:21,833
<i>The shocking murders
were committed with a variety of tools,</i>

5
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:26,333
<i>including hammers, meat hooks,
and most disturbingly, a chainsaw.</i>

6
00:01:27,916 --> 00:01:30,791
<i>There's an image in my mind
that'll never go away.</i>

7
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:37,916
<i>Of the five young victims,
only one survived, Sally Hardesty,</i>

8
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,958
<i>who after telling her story to the police,</i>

9
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:43,708
<i>never again spoke
of the horrors she saw that day.</i>

10
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:46,541
<i>After hearing Hardesty's account,</i>

11
00:01:46,625 --> 00:01:49,208
<i>officials released
this composite picture of the killer.</i>

12
00:01:49,708 --> 00:01:51,375
<i>Everybody was terrified.</i>

13
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:54,500
<i>He is said to have worn
a mask made of human skin.</i>

14
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:57,708
<i>However,
his true identity remains a mystery.</i>

15
00:01:57,791 --> 00:02:00,625
<i>For the next hour,
we'll take you on a journey</i>

16
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:04,916
<i>into one of Texas's
most famous unsolved murders.</i>

17
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,458
<i>♪ I'm from San Benito, Texas</i>...<i> ♪</i>

18
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,125
Okay, that's $18.99,

19
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:25,333
unless I can interest you
in a shirt or two.

20
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:29,833
Okay. There you go.

21
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:34,125
Whatever happened to her?

22
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:36,125
Is she still alive?

23
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:40,250
She became a ranger here in Texas.

24
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:43,875
She must have looked for that maniac
for more than 30, 40 years.

25
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:46,250
So she... she found him?

26
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:50,000
He was wearing a mask.

27
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:54,583
Not easy to locate someone
if you don't know what they look like.

28
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,458
Hey, sis, there you are.

29
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:01,291
Yeah, right where you left me, weirdo.

30
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:03,041
Hey, hey, hey. Look, look, look, look.

31
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:05,625
Something for your champagne later.

32
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:08,083
You know, you don't actually
need a corkscrew for champagne.

33
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:09,583
Come on. We've gotta beat the bus.

34
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:12,083
Where y'all headed,
if you don't mind me asking?

35
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:14,166
Uh, Harlow?

36
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,666
- Oh. I heard about you.
- You did?

37
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,041
Everybody has.

38
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,041
- Y'all have a nice day now.
- Thank you.

39
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:23,208
Gentri-fuckers.

40
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:24,333
Here.

41
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,309
Where's Dante?

42
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,333
Uh...

43
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:33,291
Success!
Found a pocket of cell signal over yonder.

44
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:34,416
Mm-hmm.

45
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,041
So, apparently, the bus took
a wrong turn like 20 miles back,

46
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:38,458
but we're back on track now.

47
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:40,083
We're fine. We're solid.

48
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:41,875
Let's get on the road. Let's go. Let's go.

49
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:00,583
Look at this guy.

50
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:02,041
Who has such a small dick

51
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,625
they need to walk around
in public with a fucking gun?

52
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:07,916
Like, I mean, is he compensating
for something? I mean...

53
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Come on, Mel.

54
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,500
- Melody, don't.
- What? I'm just saying.

55
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:12,958
Excuse me, ma'am.

56
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:14,041
What?

57
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:18,833
See, we're plagued
by feral hogs around these parts.

58
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:22,000
And the only way to deal
with an invasive species

59
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:23,541
is to eradicate them.

60
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:25,416
On sight.

61
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,958
Okay. Okay.
Let's go before she gets us all killed.

62
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:29,625
Come on, girls. Let's go.

63
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:31,750
Sorry if a big gun
makes you uncomfortable.

64
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,208
I've seen bigger.

65
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:46,833

69
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:06,833
Hey. I'm really sorry
about that back there.

70
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:09,125
You don't need me
getting mad on your behalf.

71
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:12,416
It's whatever.

72
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,583
Anyway, I'm super happy you came.

73
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:18,958
Mel, check out our post.
It's blowing up.

74
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:23,166
<i>Hey, guys. Today is the day!</i>

75
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:27,000
<i>We're finally giving birth

00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:32,166
<i>Can't wait to see you in Harlow.</i>

78
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,500
Oh, it's gonna be great. Think about it.

79
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:37,416
We can own all of this,
call it "Dantopia."

80
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,500
What?

81
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:40,250
What? Dantopia.

82
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,375
How long have you been sitting on that?

83
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:43,958
Like the last 48 hours.

84
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:46,708
I get it. Dante and Utop...
You're combining the words.

85
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:49,166
- I was just joking.
- I see what... What the fuck?

86
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:53,416
What's wrong with him?

87
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,458
Look, Melody, it's your boyfriend.

88
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:58,416
- What a fucking psycho.
- Texas mating ritual.

89
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,208
Seriously, what is wrong with that guy?

90
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,375
He's just a fucking coal roller.

91
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:11,333
Oh, great, they don't
pull over the psycho, but they stop us?

92
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:16,288
- Put your hands where they can see 'em.
- That's not funny.

93
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:19,541
<i>There's a 10-12 at the location.</i>

94
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:21,333
<i>Copy that.</i>

95
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:24,416
Howdy.

96
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:28,666
Hey, how you doing? I'm Dante Spivey.

97
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:32,208
You're the cook.

98
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:35,625
The chef. Uh, we both are.

99
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:37,875
- Hi.
- And who else you have in there?

100
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:40,000
Well, this is my future wife.

101
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:41,833
And my sister back here.

102
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:44,958
Is everything okay?

103
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:47,541
I know you got
a lot of folks coming through,

104
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,791
so me and my deputy are gonna hang around

105
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:52,125
to make sure y'all stay out of trouble.

106
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:53,958
Call me if there are any issues.

107
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,375
Sure. We have your number, and, uh,

108
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:00,833
we thank you for your service, sir.

109
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:02,750
Let's just go.

110
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:06,416
Listen, some of us
were born here, you know.

111
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:09,625
Saw it in its prime.

112
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:14,666
So please, be respectful for the town.

113
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,458
We will, sir.

114
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:19,958
Melody, what are you doing?

115
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:24,291
You know, our... our grandmother
was actually from around here.

116
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:28,291
You know, "When Harlow sunflower blooms..."

117
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:29,916
"Winter is doomed."

118
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Yeah.

119
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:34,500
Okay.

120
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,416
Welcome to Harlow.

121
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,041
Thank you.

122
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:51,500
Woo!

123
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:56,416
Finally, we made it. Welcome to Harlow.

124
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,916
Behold the joys of late-stage capitalism.

125
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,625
Woo!

126
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:25,708
Oh!

127
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:29,708
Holy shit, babe. This is amazing.

128
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:32,166
So Harlow is a ghost town.

129
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,750
Yes, but we have a vision for this place.

130
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:36,333
All it needs is young blood,

131
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:39,458
people like us, tired of the big city,
looking for a fresh start.

132
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:42,166
Dante, for what we were paying
to park the food trucks in Austin,

133
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,500
we get the whole corner over there.
That is insane.

134
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:45,958
Our restaurant will be first,

135
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:48,416
and we have to just
inspire more people to follow.

136
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,041
- We will.
- We definitely will.

137
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:53,083
This space would be perfect
for my art gallery.

138
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:56,500
Lila, look, we could put a comic book
store in here or something... cool.

139
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,500
Lit.

140
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:02,458
This is a chance for people
to start fresh somewhere

141
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,458
without the violence and the madness.

142
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:05,541
Somewhere safe.

143
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:09,708
Okay. And, I mean, seven hours by car?

144
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:12,083
I guess I can say goodbye
to my friends forever.

145
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,500
Oh Christ.

146
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:18,666
What is he doing here?

147
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:23,375
Excuse me.

148
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:29,250
Oh shit, sorry, uh, Richter.
We spoke on the phone.

149
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:30,708
- Yeah.
- Dante.

150
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:31,625
Hey.

151
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,583
Uh, Richter's our contractor, Mel.

152
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,166
Gave your buildings a facelift,

153
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,875
about all I can do in a week.

154
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,875
It looks good for the auction. Thank you.

155
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,083
You're planning to sell these?

156
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:46,708
- Oh yeah, we will.
- Mm-hmm.

157
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:47,791
All right.

158
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,416
So you guys are what? Like, a cult?

159
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:58,291
We are idealistic individuals
who want to build a better world.

160
00:09:58,375 --> 00:09:59,750
Yeah, that's a cult.

161
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,500
- What?
- It's all right, not judging.

162
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:05,833
Just pay me. We're good.

163
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:13,000
Hey guys, you should, uh...
you should see this.

164
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:14,875
What?

165
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:16,750
- Oh...
- Oh shit.

166
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:20,333
What?

167
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:23,541
Are you serious?

168
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,500
- Newsflash, we're in deep Texas.
- I don't care.

169
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:29,041
We have a bus full of
potential investors on the way.

170
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,916
They see this flag, they're not gonna buy.

171
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,541
- Trust me.
- I'm getting the cowboy.

172
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:33,791
Mel, help me.

173
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:37,291
I'll just be here.

174
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,750
Hmm...

175
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:48,875
Um, I'm going upstairs.

176
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:52,333
Look at this place. It's weird.

177
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,708
Ah, shit.

178
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:27,791
Damn, I couldn't reach it.

179
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:32,125
- Oh shit. Well, what are we going to do?
- Let's just wait for the contractor.

180
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:33,875
What are you doing in our house?

181
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,833
Uh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize...

182
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:39,833
We thought this place was empty.

183
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:53,125
Oh, you're the new neighbors, aren't you?

184
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,333
Uh...

185
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,708
Wish I'd known y'all were coming.

186
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:00,875
I'd have put my face on.

187
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:08,416
Sweet tea?

188
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:16,375
I've been running this orphanage
for nearly 50 years.

189
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:20,583
I've housed boys and girls
in need of a loving home,

190
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:25,500
and troubled teens that needed me
to show 'em mercy for their ways.

191
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,375
Please.

192
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:33,708
Ma'am, the bank, um,
reclaimed this property months ago.

193
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:36,375
You're not supposed to be here.

194
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:43,250
You talking about
that whole mix up with the bank?

195
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:44,958
That's been settled.

196
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:49,583
I paid everything I owed.
This is still our house.

197
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:51,708
You're wrong. I'm sorry, but...

198
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:54,083
I've got a title that says otherwise.

199
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:55,791
Do you mind if we see that?

200
00:12:58,125 --> 00:12:59,666
I don't have to show you anything.

201
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,990
- That's because you don't have it.
- Dante, don't.

202
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:07,416
What? Was this about my flag?

203
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:11,500
You got me all wrong.

204
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:16,750
I've taken care of
many boys like you over the years.

205
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:19,208
I don't have a problem with Negroes.

206
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:22,708
Okay. Fuck this.

207
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:24,541
You watch your mouth, boy.

208
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:26,041
You watch yours.

209
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:27,375
Where are you going?

210
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,938
Let the cops deal with her.
I don't have time for this.

211
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:31,708
I'm getting the sheriff.

212
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:35,458
It's not what you think.

213
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:40,041
That flag belonged to my great granddaddy.

214
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:43,458
It reminds me of him.

215
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:47,375
I haven't given it much thought.

216
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:51,875
I... I understand your friend.

217
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:57,625
I wish I could help you,
but you can't be here.

218
00:13:57,708 --> 00:14:00,625
There are shelters for the elderly, and...

219
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:04,708
Shelter? I'm not going anywhere.

220
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:08,041
I told you. This is our house.

221
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:11,041
Look, you'll be safer in a home
and better taken care of.

222
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:13,375
A woman your age shouldn't be on her own.

223
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:21,666
Baby, I'm fine. I'm all right.

224
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,125
Just go back to your room.

225
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:28,375
He's the last of my boys.

226
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:30,666
He needs special care.

227
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,875
He doesn't do well outside,
you understand that?

228
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:34,750
It's why I can't ever leave here.

229
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,250
Christ, Ginny, why are you still here?

230
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,250
What have you done?

231
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:44,976
Virginia, we told you weeks ago.

232
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,958
She ain't listening.
Let's get her outta here.

233
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:49,375
- We'll talk about it outside.
- Come on. Let's go.

234
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:51,666
Take it easy.

235
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:52,958
I barely touched her.

236
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:57,791
Oh my God. What is happening?
We need to call an ambulance.

237
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,333
We are the ambulance.

238
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,208
It's all right. It's her boy.

239
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:05,125
Grab the oxygen.
Put her in the van.

240
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:07,083
She's having a heart attack.

241
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:10,291
The check... It was... Please...

242
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:11,625
Hey, hey, what did you do?

243
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:14,333
We'll get you to
the hospital in no time. Just hold on.

244
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:16,958
Shit. The bus is here.

245
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,481
Fuck.

246
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:19,750
I'm going with her.

247
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:22,416
No, Melody, no, no, no.
I'll go with her. I'll go.

248
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,375
What?

249
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:25,375
Everyone's expecting
to see the two of you.

250
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:26,333
She'll be okay.

251
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:27,416
Come on.

252
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:29,713
- Christ.
- Somebody needs to.

253
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,375
It can't be Melody, can't be you.

254
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:34,958
You need to focus on this.
I'll be back as soon as I can.

255
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:38,416
Okay. Please just
make sure she's all right.

256
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,125
Thank you. You're an angel.

257
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:41,291
Let's move.

258
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:56,958
Here's your flag.

259
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:05,208
Come on, Mel.
We'll get somebody to clean that up.

260
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:10,750
Did that not feel like a bad omen to you?

261
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:12,041
This place is cursed now.

262
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,833
Please, this is not...

263
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:16,291
I don't need this right now,
so... it's all good.

264
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,458
If you move here,
I'm moving back with Dad.

265
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:21,458
No, you're not.

266
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:24,666
I... I don't want to live here.
Your whole idea is insane.

267
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,541
- You don't know what you want.
- Okay, and you do?

268
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:31,750
Uh, I know you need me,
and you can't take care of yourself.

269
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:34,541
Wait.

270
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:38,541
Why did I...?

271
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,934
Honestly, the bank
could've never dreamed of selling these

272
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:43,166
without your help, Dante.

273
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,226
- Thank you for trusting us.
- It's amazing.

274
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,541
Absolutely. Um...

275
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:48,708
Mel! Mel! Catherine, come here.

276
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:51,833
This is Catherine,
you know, from the bank.

277
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:53,767
She made all this possible.

278
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:55,833
Finally. It's nice to meet you.

279
00:16:57,208 --> 00:17:01,083
You know, everyone is super excited.
You guys did a great job promoting this.

280
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:02,958
Yeah, just needs a fresh coat of paint.

281
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:05,125
Oh no, it is perfect like this.

282
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:07,708
These people want the wear-down.
You know, the history?

283
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:08,833
Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah.

284
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,833
- This is going to be great.
- Yeah.

285
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:13,833
I'm just going to start
setting up, so... Okay.

286
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:16,208
Is she all right?

287
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:18,458
Yeah, I think the heat's
just getting to her a bit.

288
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:19,541
It's so hot out here.

289
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:21,750
- Probably needed a little water.
- Yeah. It's hot.

290
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,000
How's she doing?

291
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:39,666
Baby, who's the good boy
I taught you to be?

292
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:43,125
Stay out of my room.

293
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,250
Shit.

294
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,333
Sheriff, I think she croaked.

295
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:07,041
Son of a bitch.

296
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:10,625
Oh my God.

297
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:27,666
Hey.

298
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,666
No!

299
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:48,625
What the hell's going on?

300
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,166
Oh my God!

301
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:08,416
And sold to Candace Brady
of Brady's Brunch.

302
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,625
Aw! I love brunch. That's great.

303
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:14,208
Well, this was built in 1910,

304
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:18,166
and once counted President Howard Taft
as a distinguished guest.

305
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,583
<i>Got a high chance of thunderstorms,</i>

306
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:26,916
<i>lightning, and heavy rain.</i>

307
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,375
<i>Stay dry out there.</i>

308
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:33,500
So, Richter...

309
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:36,000
why are you such a nihilist?

310
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,500
A what?

311
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:40,666
I mean, anyone who blasts diesel
into the atmosphere like that

312
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,875
truly gives zero fucks
about, like, anything.

313
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:44,958
I'm a Texan.

314
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:48,291
I don't like people telling me what to do,

315
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:52,708
especially smug,
self-righteous, rich, city folk.

316
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:03,291
Is it loaded?

317
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,541
Ever shot one before?

318
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,500
No.

319
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:22,541
Been shot at.

320
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:31,666
Drunk dad?

321
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:35,083
Stonebrook High.

322
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:50,500
That must be tough, living with that.

323
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,375
I mean...

324
00:20:56,708 --> 00:21:00,416
Everyone expects me
to do something special with my life now,

325
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:05,375
and I can only disappoint them.

326
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:11,833
My friends were the special ones.

327
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:15,208
Not me.

328
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,083
Please stick around for music and drinks.

329
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:22,500
We have a lot to celebrate.
Thank you all so much.

330
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:35,375
Come on, Mel. Have a drink with me.
We did it. We did it. What a dream.

331
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:37,583
What?

332
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:42,291
Damn.

333
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:47,041
Damn? That's...
That's all you have to say?

334
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,291
We just killed her.

335
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,500
Heart disease killed her. Mel.

336
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:55,333
Where you going, Mel?

337
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:57,666
I'm getting Lila
and taking her out of here. Okay?

338
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,416
This just doesn't feel right anymore.

339
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,416
Wait. Wait.
Mel, this wasn't our fault. Mel!

340
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:04,333
Lila?

341
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:18,833
Where's my sister?

342
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:28,333
We're leaving.

343
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:30,250
Okay.

344
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:32,333
Really? That guy?
Are you kidding me?

345
00:22:32,416 --> 00:22:34,583
- You think I fucked him?
- I don't know. Did you?

346
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:35,833
I just used the bathroom.

347
00:22:35,916 --> 00:22:38,677
I know you think I'm a total train wreck,
but give me a break. Please.

348
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:39,708
I'm sorry.

349
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:42,166
The old lady died.

350
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:46,375
I really need you
to leave with me right now. Okay?

351
00:22:46,458 --> 00:22:47,833
Can you do that, please?

352
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:49,583
Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I can do that.

353
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:51,625
Put that shit out.

354
00:24:12,833 --> 00:24:13,916
Hello.

355
00:24:15,208 --> 00:24:16,291
Hello.

356
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,541
Hello, please.

357
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,333
<i>Is anybody there?</i>

358
00:24:24,416 --> 00:24:25,541
<i>Please.</i>

359
00:24:25,625 --> 00:24:28,666
<i>I am hurt. I have been in an accident.</i>

360
00:24:29,916 --> 00:24:35,583
<i>Please, I'm on Route 74, outside Harlow.</i>

361
00:24:47,375 --> 00:24:48,416
Oh my God.

362
00:24:50,416 --> 00:24:52,875
Oh my God. He's... He's cutting...

363
00:25:17,625 --> 00:25:20,375
He's wearing her face.

364
00:25:22,541 --> 00:25:25,166
<i>He's wearing her face.</i>

365
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,750
No, no. Shh. Please.

366
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
You sure you're not
gonna stay for the party?

367
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:40,041
- Yeah, I'm just not really feeling well.
- Okay.

368
00:28:40,125 --> 00:28:41,250
Just the heat, you know?

369
00:28:41,333 --> 00:28:43,101
- Yeah.
- Take the car. I'll take the bus back.

370
00:28:43,125 --> 00:28:46,125
Wait. What the fuck? What the...

371
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:48,208
- Hey!
- Hey. What?

372
00:28:49,083 --> 00:28:50,541
What the fuck are you doing?

373
00:28:51,333 --> 00:28:52,833
Heard you killed that lady.

374
00:28:54,291 --> 00:28:57,250
We didn't kill anybody.
She was trespassing on our property.

375
00:28:57,333 --> 00:29:01,125
You sure that was your property?
Huh? Looked like she disagreed.

376
00:29:01,208 --> 00:29:02,791
Please just give us back the keys.

377
00:29:03,416 --> 00:29:05,000
Give me the keys.

378
00:29:05,666 --> 00:29:09,125
Show me you have the deed
to that house, you'll have them back.

379
00:29:09,208 --> 00:29:10,541
I'll be in the shop.

380
00:29:13,375 --> 00:29:14,875
That fucking guy.

381
00:29:14,958 --> 00:29:16,458
Just give him what he wants.

382
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:23,500
- Let's keep the bank out of this.
- Please tell me you have it.

383
00:29:23,583 --> 00:29:25,375
I do. I have it.

384
00:29:31,166 --> 00:29:32,500
Then where is it?

385
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:38,625
It... It must be at the office.
Back in Austin.

386
00:29:38,708 --> 00:29:39,583
Dante.

387
00:29:39,666 --> 00:29:41,875
Some deeds took
longer than others to process.

388
00:29:41,958 --> 00:29:43,958
Tell me we didn't
kick her out of her own house.

389
00:29:44,041 --> 00:29:46,666
We didn't. I'm telling you.
It must be back at the office.

390
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:50,708
Hey, if that's true,
then it can't be in the house, right?

391
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:54,833
All right, you stay here. Let's go.

392
00:29:54,916 --> 00:29:57,291
Hey, wait, can you
just relax for a second?

393
00:29:57,375 --> 00:29:59,916
I'll never relax until
I'm sure we're on the right side of this.

394
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:02,083
- I'm coming with.
- No, please.

395
00:30:02,166 --> 00:30:03,291
Just do what I tell you?

396
00:30:03,375 --> 00:30:06,083
- Why do I have to stay with these people?
- Please just stay.

397
00:30:07,458 --> 00:30:08,791
Come on, let's go.

398
00:30:10,291 --> 00:30:11,583
This is bullshit.

399
00:30:15,791 --> 00:30:18,166
Hey there, I'm calling for Hardesty.

400
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,083
Sure, I'll hold.

401
00:30:43,333 --> 00:30:44,666
This is Hardesty.

402
00:31:51,583 --> 00:31:53,666
You look down here. I'll check upstairs.

403
00:32:07,791 --> 00:32:08,791
Okay...

404
00:33:00,125 --> 00:33:01,125
Is that it?

405
00:33:51,791 --> 00:33:53,000
Da... Dante?

406
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:02,291
Da... Dante?

407
00:34:15,375 --> 00:34:16,416
Mel?

408
00:36:48,833 --> 00:36:51,500
I hope everyone
is having a great time out there.

409
00:36:51,583 --> 00:36:52,916
We've gotten lots done!

410
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,791
This town is ours! DJ...

411
00:37:57,666 --> 00:37:59,458
Okay, everybody on the bus.

412
00:37:59,541 --> 00:38:01,125
Party continues on the bus.

413
00:38:01,208 --> 00:38:04,000
Get in the bus. Everyone in the bus.

414
00:39:33,291 --> 00:39:34,375
To Harlow!

415
00:39:36,125 --> 00:39:39,333
Has anyone seen Dante? I'll go get him.

416
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,375
Let me top you off there.

417
00:40:01,041 --> 00:40:02,041
Dante?

418
00:40:02,791 --> 00:40:03,791
Hey.

419
00:40:05,458 --> 00:40:07,125
What were you doing in that house?

420
00:40:09,041 --> 00:40:11,458
Hey, I'm talking to you.

421
00:40:11,541 --> 00:40:13,166
Don't walk away from me.

422
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:15,166
Hey, man, you okay?

423
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:30,083
Here, I gotcha. I got you.

424
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,833
What happened to him?

425
00:40:38,125 --> 00:40:39,041
Oh my God.

426
00:40:39,125 --> 00:40:41,250
Who did this to you, huh?

427
00:40:42,125 --> 00:40:44,541
Hold on. Hey, don't let go. Don't let go.

428
00:40:47,541 --> 00:40:48,875
Oh my God.

429
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,958
Call the cops. You hear me?

430
00:40:53,041 --> 00:40:54,458
Keep everyone on the bus.

431
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:58,250
- Go on.
- Okay.

432
00:40:59,125 --> 00:41:00,166
Go on now.

433
00:41:09,875 --> 00:41:11,583
Shut the door. Keep it closed.

434
00:41:11,666 --> 00:41:12,666
What happened?

435
00:41:12,708 --> 00:41:15,333
I don't know.
Just keep the door closed.

436
00:43:02,333 --> 00:43:03,791
What the fuck?

437
00:43:10,083 --> 00:43:11,708
Ah!

438
00:43:36,708 --> 00:43:37,916
Ah!

439
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:22,990
<i>We have a report of a dead body in Harlow.</i>

440
00:45:23,666 --> 00:45:25,500
<i>Come on, Naiman, you there?</i>

441
00:45:25,583 --> 00:45:27,958
<i>You're the only guys
I have in a 50-mile radius.</i>

442
00:45:31,708 --> 00:45:34,083
<i>We need an officer in Harlow.</i>

443
00:45:35,416 --> 00:45:36,541
<i>Please respond.</i>

444
00:46:11,083 --> 00:46:14,208
I fear no evil. I fear no evil.

445
00:46:49,375 --> 00:46:51,208
Stay in your seat, please.

446
00:46:51,708 --> 00:46:53,875
- What's happening?
- Just trust me.

447
00:46:53,958 --> 00:46:55,208
Stay in your seat.

448
00:46:56,458 --> 00:46:58,500
- Please open the door.
- Don't.

449
00:47:02,041 --> 00:47:03,041
Fuck this.

450
00:47:03,833 --> 00:47:05,250
Where are you going?

451
00:47:06,833 --> 00:47:08,916
Melody? Mel?

452
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:17,125
Oh my...

453
00:50:11,708 --> 00:50:12,625
Mel?

454
00:50:12,708 --> 00:50:14,458
- No. No, Lila.
- Melody?

455
00:50:14,541 --> 00:50:18,208
Mel? Melody? Mel?

456
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,583
- Melody! Melody?
- Lila!

457
00:50:37,666 --> 00:50:38,666
Lila, go!

458
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:46,750
Oh my God. Melody.

459
00:50:47,333 --> 00:50:50,333
Help! Lila! Lila! Help!

460
00:50:53,041 --> 00:50:55,375
I got you. Come on. Come on.

461
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:58,708
Melody?

462
00:51:02,458 --> 00:51:03,458
Wait.

463
00:51:04,208 --> 00:51:05,375
Run!

464
00:51:15,833 --> 00:51:18,000
Wake up. Wake up!

465
00:51:22,791 --> 00:51:25,059
What happened?

466
00:51:25,083 --> 00:51:27,916
Fucking drive! Drive!

467
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:31,791
Whoa, are you okay?

468
00:51:31,875 --> 00:51:35,625
Wait. Wait. What the fuck is happening?

469
00:51:36,875 --> 00:51:37,875
Melody?

470
00:51:38,791 --> 00:51:39,833
Fuck.

471
00:51:41,333 --> 00:51:43,416
Get us out of here.

472
00:51:44,208 --> 00:51:45,458
Let's go! Let's go!

473
00:51:53,583 --> 00:51:55,208
Go this way.

474
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:58,750
Come on. Keep going.

475
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:08,625
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Don't stop. No, no, no, no.

476
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,833
Don't open the...
Dude, where are you going?

477
00:52:13,625 --> 00:52:15,065
What's happening?

478
00:52:15,125 --> 00:52:16,666
- No, no, no.
- Melody?

479
00:52:37,375 --> 00:52:39,833
This party is really good, right?

480
00:52:41,208 --> 00:52:42,250
You okay?

481
00:52:42,333 --> 00:52:43,333
Run.

482
00:52:43,666 --> 00:52:45,541
No.

483
00:52:52,791 --> 00:52:54,166
Look at this freak show.

484
00:52:58,958 --> 00:53:00,208
Bro, what are you doing?

485
00:53:00,791 --> 00:53:04,250
Try anything and you're canceled, bro.

486
00:53:07,458 --> 00:53:08,916
Oh, fuck.

487
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Oh God!

488
00:54:12,625 --> 00:54:13,625
<i>Get up.</i>

489
00:54:13,666 --> 00:54:16,208
Lila! Lila, get up. I got you.

490
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:02,750
Look.

491
00:55:19,583 --> 00:55:20,583
Ah!

492
00:55:42,125 --> 00:55:43,125
Melody?

493
00:55:44,375 --> 00:55:46,333
- Melody?
- Lila, I can't.

494
00:55:46,416 --> 00:55:47,333
Fuck!

495
00:55:50,958 --> 00:55:52,318
Come on, Melody. You gotta!

496
00:55:55,125 --> 00:55:58,416
Come on, Melody. Holy shit!

497
00:55:59,375 --> 00:56:01,750
Come on. Melody, come on, please.

498
00:56:04,083 --> 00:56:05,333
Oh my God!

499
00:56:05,416 --> 00:56:07,666
Come on! Come on!

500
00:56:08,166 --> 00:56:10,666
I got you. Come on.

501
00:56:12,083 --> 00:56:14,291
We gotta get down. Lila, let's go!

502
00:56:20,458 --> 00:56:22,208
Melody, I got you. Come on.

503
00:56:27,833 --> 00:56:31,833
- Help!
- Oh my God. Help. Help!

504
00:56:31,916 --> 00:56:33,875
Come on. Get in the back.

505
00:56:39,333 --> 00:56:42,458
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

506
00:56:46,833 --> 00:56:49,583
He just... He killed... Dante.

507
00:56:49,666 --> 00:56:50,958
It's him, isn't it?

508
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:53,041
He killed everyone.

509
00:56:53,708 --> 00:56:55,166
Leatherface.

510
00:56:57,541 --> 00:56:59,500
What? What? Please drive.

511
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:02,125
What are you doing? What?

512
00:57:02,208 --> 00:57:03,625
- Drive!
- Please, go!

513
00:57:03,708 --> 00:57:06,333
Fifty years I've been waiting
for this night.

514
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,333
Just to see him again.

515
00:57:09,416 --> 00:57:10,625
She locked us in.

516
00:57:10,708 --> 00:57:12,958
Please drive.
You have to let us out of here.

517
00:57:13,041 --> 00:57:14,291
I'm sorry, I can't.

518
00:57:14,958 --> 00:57:16,666
Looks like it's you that he wants.

519
00:57:17,333 --> 00:57:20,000
You need to stay until I kill him.

520
00:57:20,083 --> 00:57:24,083
- No, no, no.
- No, please. Please, no!

521
00:57:26,666 --> 00:57:28,416
Please, please, help.

522
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:31,791
No, don't. What? No.

523
00:57:31,875 --> 00:57:35,250
No, please.
Please, please, please let us out!

524
00:57:35,333 --> 00:57:36,333
Please. No!

525
00:57:37,875 --> 00:57:42,916
No! No! Don't leave! No!

526
00:57:43,541 --> 00:57:46,916
No, please. No! No, you can't.

527
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,458
You can't leave us. No!

528
00:57:49,541 --> 00:57:52,916
No. What the fuck?

529
00:58:53,958 --> 00:58:55,041
Turn around.

530
00:59:03,541 --> 00:59:10,375
Kirk, Pamela, Jerry, and Franklin.

531
00:59:22,916 --> 00:59:24,125
Say my name.

532
00:59:27,458 --> 00:59:28,458
Say you know me.

533
00:59:29,791 --> 00:59:32,291
Say you know what you did to my friends.

534
00:59:40,916 --> 00:59:42,541
You don't remember me.

535
01:00:00,541 --> 01:00:01,666
Fuck.

536
01:00:03,208 --> 01:00:06,958
You know, I was supposed
to die in the school that day.

537
01:00:09,666 --> 01:00:11,250
So death followed me here.

538
01:00:11,333 --> 01:00:13,625
Death... Look at me.

539
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:19,958
I'm not going to let him kill you, okay?
I prom...

540
01:00:29,375 --> 01:00:31,291
No! No!

541
01:00:39,541 --> 01:00:41,416
Remember me now?

542
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:43,416
I'm the one that got away,

543
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:45,666
and I'm here to make sure you don't.

544
01:00:46,583 --> 01:00:47,833
Motherfucker.

545
01:00:53,625 --> 01:00:55,416
Get the fuck out of here.

546
01:01:11,041 --> 01:01:12,041
Come on.

547
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:27,750
What are you doing?

548
01:02:01,916 --> 01:02:03,791
- Put your seat belt on.
- Fuck.

549
01:02:13,083 --> 01:02:14,791
Fuck you!

550
01:02:46,291 --> 01:02:47,416
Oh my God.

551
01:02:49,791 --> 01:02:53,208
- Fuck. Oh God. I...
- Oh, Melody.

552
01:02:53,958 --> 01:02:56,583
No, don't touch it. Oh, I can't.

553
01:02:58,500 --> 01:02:59,500
I can't.

554
01:03:02,458 --> 01:03:03,375
Melody, he's coming.

555
01:03:03,458 --> 01:03:07,000
- Lila. Lila, listen. Listen.
- No, come on. I gotta get you out of this.

556
01:03:07,083 --> 01:03:08,666
- I can get you out.
- Listen. Listen!

557
01:03:10,833 --> 01:03:14,000
He's gonna kill me right now.
I'm sorry, there's no other way.

558
01:03:14,083 --> 01:03:15,875
But you, you have to run.

559
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:16,833
No. I can't.

560
01:03:16,916 --> 01:03:19,375
I don't have anyone else.
I can't leave you.

561
01:03:19,458 --> 01:03:20,541
Yes, you can.

562
01:03:20,625 --> 01:03:22,583
You're the strongest person I know, okay?

563
01:03:22,666 --> 01:03:24,041
You never needed me.

564
01:03:26,166 --> 01:03:28,708
You can do this.
You just have to fucking run.

565
01:03:29,333 --> 01:03:30,916
Fucking run.

566
01:03:32,416 --> 01:03:33,541
Run!

567
01:03:57,208 --> 01:03:58,208
I'm sorry.

568
01:04:00,416 --> 01:04:02,041
For what I did to your mama.

569
01:04:05,041 --> 01:04:06,500
She didn't deserve that.

570
01:04:19,208 --> 01:04:20,208
Hey, Leatherfuck.

571
01:04:25,833 --> 01:04:26,833
Shit.

572
01:04:28,750 --> 01:04:30,000

No!

574
01:05:00,833 --> 01:05:01,833
Lila?

575
01:05:02,875 --> 01:05:04,666
Lila! Lila?

576
01:05:08,875 --> 01:05:09,995
Thank you. Thank you.

577
01:05:10,041 --> 01:05:11,083
Don't run.

578
01:05:16,625 --> 01:05:17,666
Don't run.

579
01:05:18,666 --> 01:05:19,916
If you run...

580
01:05:23,625 --> 01:05:26,916
he'll never stop haunting you.
