This is where
the guard lives.

168
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,791
The one that didn't
show for work.

169
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,758
All right. I got it.

170
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,672
Stay here in case
something else comes in.

171
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,955
All right.

172
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,638
(car horns honking in distance)

173
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,637
GCPD.

174
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,394
No! Okay. Okay...

175
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,757
Shut up! Talk to him.

176
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,560
(grunting)

177
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,239
This is
Detective Bullock.

178
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,915
(breath trembling)

179
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,514
You understand?

180
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,920
Oh, my God.

181
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,151
You understand
what you have to do?

182
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,600
Oh, my God.

183
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,716
I don't have a choice!

184
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,632
(gunshot)
(body thuds)

185
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,072
(door opens)

186
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,078
What the hell happened, Harvey?

187
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,831
What did Harper say?

188
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,957
I want to hear it from you.

189
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,029
We, uh, tracked down
this Arkham guard

190
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,840
we thought maybe
helped Nygma escape.

191
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,673
I shot him.

192
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,513
End of story.

193
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,274
You're confessing...

194
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,875
to killing an unarmed
suspect in cold blood.

195
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,599
That's what happened.

196
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,873
You got to let it go.

197
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,997
Harvey, I don't
know if you think

198
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,754
you're protecting
yourself or someone else,

199
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,240
but you need
to change your story.

200
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,118
Otherwise
you're going to Blackgate.

201
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,113
And you know what happens
to cops in Blackgate.

202
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,040
That's what happened.

203
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,794
So let it go.

204
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,792
(indistinct chatter)

205
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,230
All right, first things first.

206
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,915
Whoever here doesn't believe
Harvey Bullock is innocent

207
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,912
can leave right now.

208
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,515
Good.

209
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,032
(sighs)
You think Nygma's behind this?

210
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,431
Maybe. But he's been
inside Arkham for ten years.

211
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,176
It's not like he suddenly
decided to break out.

212
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,510
- He had help.
- ALVAREZ: Penguin gets released today.

213
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,875
You think...?

214
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,077
Yeah. Put a tail on him.

215
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,399
In the meantime, I
want every other cop

216
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,477
in this city
on the hunt for Edward Nygma.

217
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,960
We looked into
the dead guard.

218
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,157
He used to be associated
with a southside gang.

219
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,959
Got an address.
An old warehouse.

220
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,216
All right.
You and I will hit it.

221
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,880
Rest of you have your
orders. Let's go.

222
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,872

241
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,394
I will lay flowers on the grave

And what of Jim Gordon's role
in your incarceration?

243

Will you seek revenge?

244

The best revenge

will be a life spent serving

Turn around!

You know, you made a mistake
bringing me out to this pier.

333
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,352
Don't talk!

334
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,318
Or maybe you
just have a short memory.

00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,952
How wonderful to see you again.

343
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,151
It's been far,
far too long.

344
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,353
Where is he?

345

I came here to tell him
to stop spying on me.

348
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,240
I don't understand.

349
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,470
I was out the
other night

350
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,233
and I felt someone watching me.

351
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,834
I know it was Bruce.

352
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,400
Oh, I see,
right, well,

353
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,517
that makes perfect sense.

354
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,115
So you come here tonight dressed
to the nines to tell him

355
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,776
that you want nothing more
to do with him.

00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,712
He left, Alfred.

358
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,395
Everything we went through,
and one day he's just gone.

359
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,472
He doesn't get to come back
after ten years

360
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,631
and act like nothing's happened.

361
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,552
On this, we absolutely agree.

362
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,272
I do, however,
feel it might be something

363
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,591
that you want to tell him
yourself.

364
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,880
He needs to stay away.

to begin his speech.

You know, come out,

seem to want to show.

Excuse me.

437
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,856
There were four crates of C-4.

Where are the rest?

439
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,880
That's all he gave me.

440
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,997
- He said Penguin broke him out.
- No.

441
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,576

Penguin not's just the patsy.

He's not even the real threat.

446

So how do we defuse it?

We'd have to sever
the connectors to the detonator,

It must be in one

Wait. This particular detonator
has a gyroscope.

00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,152
Sir, Nygma's vanished.

496
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,560
There's more.

497
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,440
Mayor James ordered Bullock
sent to Blackgate.

498
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,834
He's about to be moved.

499
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,798
(sirens wailing in distance)

500
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,276
GORDON:
Stop! Stop!

501
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,990
The person who framed you,

502
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,336
the one behind Nygma's breakout,

503
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,856
is it who I think it is?
Has he been faking it?

504
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,349
Jim, do not say his name!

505
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,033
Is it Jeremiah Valeska?

506
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,393
(grunts)
Harvey.

507
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,994
Check him for a wire!
What?

508
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,515
Under his shirt.
Check for a wire.

509
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,155
BULLOCK:
Oh, God, it's too late.

510
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,512
He's miked.

511
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,910
Jim, you don't know
what he'll do.

512
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,231
I-I don't know about this.

513
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,993
How much is it again?

514
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,914
ORDERLY: Ten bucks is a body punch.
$20, you get the face.

515
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,354
Stabbing him is a C-note.

516
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,556
Huh.

517
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,359
(grunting)

518
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,680
Bad news, boss.

519
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,400
Our cover's blownskies.

520
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,120
(chuckles softly)

521
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,600
(cackles)

522
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,716
(gasps)

523
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,712
(car horns honking in distance)

524
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,476
(grunts)

525
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,119
OSWALD:
Edward Nygma.

526
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,352
It is very good to see you.

527
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,990
Oswald... I thought
you weren't behind this.

528
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,080
I'm not.

529
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,834
But I thought you might need
some help,

530
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,674
and... what else
are friends for?

531
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,160
(chuckles)

532
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,754
You look well.

533
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,911
You, too.

534
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,136
A little thicker
in the middle.

535
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,196
(chuckles)

536
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,876
Damn, it's good
to see you, Oswald.

537
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,155
(both chuckling)

538
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,309
(tires screeching)

539
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,517
Wh-What was that?
What was that?

540
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,478
(screams)

541
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,560
(crash)

542
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,313
(horn honking)

543
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,756
What the hell was that?!

544
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,752
(coughs)

545
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,718
(whooshing)

546
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,760
(both screaming)

547
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,000
(sirens wailing in distance)

548
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,750
Alfred, when Bruce came
to me the day he got back

549
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,880
and told me what he was
planning, I didn't hesitate.

550
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,439
I believe in what he's doing,

551
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,352
but he's going
to need some help.

552
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,112
Has he thought
about telling Gordon?

553
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,635
Lucius, my old friend,

554
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,880
whoever Bruce decides to take
on this journey with him,

555
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,752
it's his decision.

556
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,390
Our role... is to serve.

557
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,314
(Oswald and Nygma straining)

558
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,909
Down!

559
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,912
- Get me down!
- Aah!

560
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,637
Something happened
tonight, didn't it?

561
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,915
Why won't you tell me?

562
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,560
Because everything
worked out okay, didn't it?

563
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,476
So why are we at your old club?

564
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,392
Because Mommy just needs
to get something.

565
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,155
<i>♪♪ I ♪♪</i>

566
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,955
<i>♪♪ Now, I don't hardly... ♪♪</i>

567
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,236
Wait here, okay?

568
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,598
<i>♪♪ But I think
I could love her ♪♪</i>

569
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,280
Turn around.

570
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,113
<i>♪♪ Crimson and clover ♪♪</i>

571
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,032
Turn around.

572
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,918
I won't ask again.

573
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,514
Surprise.

574
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,831
(grunting)

575
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,400
Easy.

576
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,437
It's just
a surprise party.

577
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,276
For you, Barbara Kean,

578
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,556
queen of Gotham,

579
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,917
business titan.
How exciting.

580
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,438
But there was another you,
I...

581
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,318
I seem to recall.

582
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,470
Wasn't there?

583
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,153
Then again, there was, uh,

584
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,277
another me, too.

585
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,319
Oh, so hard holding on
to what's real. It's...

586
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,153
(grunts)
It's enough to drive you mad.

587
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,240
(chuckles)

588
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:19,359
(grunting)

589
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,671
No!

590
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,877
BARBARA LEE (screams):
Mom!

591
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,872
Cute.

592
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,474
(panting)

593
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,631
She has your eyes.

594
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,200
For now.

595
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,549
No, put me down.

596
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,632
(whimpers)
I...

597
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,632
think she...

598
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,871
nicked me, Daddy.

599
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,599
I...

600
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,273
Oh, boy.

601
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,397
Oh, dear me.

602
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,233
My sweet Ecco,

603
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,960
no longer my echo.

604
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,760
There will never be one
like you.

605
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,439
Really?

606
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,918
(chuckles)

607
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,834
But I suppose
there are other fish in the sea.

608
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,920
Let me...

609
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,150
down.
(panting)

610
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,754
- Mom!
- Hush,

611
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,197
little Barbaras,
don't say a word.

612
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,431
Now we're going
to play a...

613
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,159
little game.
(panting)

614
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,272
By now, James Gordon
should have made it

615
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,680
to your apartment.

616
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,877
When he gets here,
I want you to deliver

617
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,474
a message. Okay?

618
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,789
(exhales, sniffles)

619
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,200
Okay?

620
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,158
(giggles)

621
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,833
Okay?

622
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,316
(door opens)

623
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,400
GORDON:
Barbara.

624
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,712
I'll call an ambulance.

625
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,952
Barbara.

626
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,360
He took her!

627
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,079
That lunatic took her!

628
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,231
He said you have to come,
and if you don't come,

629
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,390
he's gonna kill her.

630
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,715
Where?

631
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,791
The place
where he was born again.

632
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,119
He means Ace Chemicals.

633
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,836
You promise me.

634
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,872
I'll bring her back.

635
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,552
(door opens)

636
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,233
(door closes)

637
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,869
JEREMIAH:
Come along, Commissioner.

638
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,553
We're waiting.

639
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,476
The party's raging,

640
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,031
but it's well past the
princess's bedtime.

641
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,911
It's funny, being back here.

642
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,550
I can still
feel my flesh

643
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,552
sizzle
as it melted away.

644
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,120
Burns even now.

645
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,271
Ooh. Oh.

646
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,360
(screams)

647
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,240
I'm here.

648
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,959
Everything's gonna be fine.

649
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,918
You think so?

650
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,357
Personally, I'd say things are
about as far away from fine

651
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,636
as they could possibly be,
Barbara Lee.

652
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,430
What do I know? I did just
spend the last ten years

653
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,477
in the funny farm.
(giggles)

654
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,711
What do you want,
Jeremiah?

655
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,594
Is there a Jeremiah here?

656
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,833
So what do I call you?

657
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,920
Uh...

658
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,639
I don't know.

659
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,837
Call me... Jack.

660
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,200
Mm, no, no, no,
that's not right.

661
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,311
J-Joseph. John. Jay.

662
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,920
