1
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,365
Ambulances are on the field! I had to .../ by email7

2
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:42,432
Jack! Don't worry, you've already won the season. And it doesn’t matter if you didn’t win the last race!

3
00:01:42,433 --> 00:01:46,165
- The engine failed in the last laps.
- Let's take a look! Get the cables fast!

4
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:48,532
- Jacob *
-	Counties.

5
00:01:49,433 --> 00:01:51,599
- How are you, Dad?
- Did you notice anything?

6
00:01:51,633 --> 00:01:57,232
There is a large oil puddle in the second round. Bell doesn't risk it, Corbin goes wild, his sponsor is on the podium.

7
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,899
- Watch out for the 23rd.
- Linder.


8
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:30,432
SECURE RECEPTION INTERMEDIATE

9
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,932
Natural psychopath.


10
00:03:00,866 --> 00:03:03,465
Wow, there's a puddle of oil in the second round!

11
00:03:08,566 --> 00:03:10,799
I'll lure you there.

12
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,232
Damn it!

13
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:28,032
What do you see, Dominic?

14
00:03:33,533 --> 00:03:35,232
He wants revenge on you ...

15
00:03:42,133 --> 00:03:44,399
... surround to the left.

16
00:04:46,433 --> 00:04:48,432
So you are our luck!

17
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,032
I need the name of that damn bookmaker!

18
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:56,032
Melbet!

19
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:01,132
Fuck harder!

20
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,399
Melbet!

21
00:05:04,233 --> 00:05:07,565
Now get up and show me how to register online.

22
00:05:13,766 --> 00:05:15,432
You can now win a great prize!

23
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,699
Give me the key for three to eight.


24
00:05:24,766 --> 00:05:28,765
Now give me ... six extensions.

25
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:35,065
Are you sure?

26
00:05:45,733 --> 00:05:48,132
Remember what I told you?


27
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:50,399
Pay attention to the details.

28
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:53,865
Big things are made of small things. Now look.

29
00:05:55,733 --> 00:05:57,865
Did Dad succeed?

30
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,499
Do you remember the steps?

31
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,965
The eighth key was not needed!

32
00:06:01,966 --> 00:06:03,399
I agree.

33
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,899
The boiler does not work again.

34
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:08,799
That’s the price of living away from the world.

35
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,465
Do you want to help us here?

36
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:18,265
Are you waiting for someone?

37
00:06:21,233 --> 00:06:23,932
Brian, do you remember where you had to hide?


38
00:06:47,933 --> 00:06:50,465
Easy, my friend!

39
00:06:50,733 --> 00:06:52,965
We came in peace!

40
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,832
Lehel! Both!

41
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,165
It's just me!

42
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,532
Iran!

43
00:07:00,566 --> 00:07:04,465
Maybe they don’t recognize me because I tanned for a week.

44
00:07:06,533 --> 00:07:10,065
Brian, okay, get out of there.


45
00:07:17,033 --> 00:07:21,532
Why then do you take out your bazooka later? This is to kill elephants.

46
00:07:21,533 --> 00:07:22,932
We would call ...

47
00:07:22,933 --> 00:07:25,999
... you just don't have a phone.

48
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,399
So no way.

49
00:07:27,733 --> 00:07:29,765
- Brian baby.
- Hello!

50
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,899
- Large enough!
- All in one car ...

51
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:36,199
What the hell is going on?


52
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,732
Help! Hurry They attacked us! One of us is a traitor!

53
00:07:41,033 --> 00:07:43,599
I urgently need it

54
00:07:43,633 --> 00:07:48,499
There is little time left! I have a very important load here! Gather your team quickly!

55
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,099
I live, but this ...


56
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:58,965
Mr. Nobody's machine sent an alarm. There is a lot of encrypted data that I need to decrypt.

57
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,099
- Has anyone else seen this?
- That's the point, he was just looking for us.

58
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:05,665
This is very strange.

59
00:08:13,866 --> 00:08:16,032
He caught Cipher

60
00:08:16,066 --> 00:08:18,865
... but he was attacked in the air and escaped.


61
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:22,065
I'm sure your plane crashed here ...

62
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,132
... in the northwest of Montequinto.

63
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:30,665
We have to try to find it. He could survive. But it is not realistic to get there, but a closed area. And he has a lot of military staff.

64
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,765
I withdrew from these matters.


65
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:41,332
Wait, Dominica ...!
It's about Cipher ...

66
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:44,565
... your child's mother's killer.

67
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:50,032
Everything is in the past.

68
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,965
Well, we left at 8 in the morning. If you change your mind.

69
00:09:00,066 --> 00:09:01,865
Thanks.

70
00:09:03,633 --> 00:09:06,632
iPápi! Do you know where God lives?

71
00:09:06,633 --> 00:09:07,932
And where?


72
00:09:07,966 --> 00:09:09,465
In your heart

73
00:09:09,766 --> 00:09:11,765
So, and yours too.

74
00:09:11,766 --> 00:09:16,399
But the most important thing is that ...
I ... will always be in your heart.

75
00:09:16,433 --> 00:09:18,099
How are you, dear?

76
00:09:18,133 --> 00:09:20,499
I have a gift for you.

77
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:24,065
Your father gave it to me.

78
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,432
I'll give it to you now.

79
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:30,032
Very special.

80
00:09:30,466 --> 00:09:32,499
Don't lose.

81
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,332
Sweet Dreams

82
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,265
This kind of life is not for us.


83
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,132
Brian and Mia left these things when their children were born.

84
00:10:10,866 --> 00:10:12,732
We are different.

85
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,899
They attacked us!
One of us is a traitor!


86
00:10:56,933 --> 00:11:01,265
They're in! I have a very important load here! Gathering their team ...

87
00:11:01,266 --> 00:11:03,599
They will all kill ...

88
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,765
Who else lives! Stop ...

89
00:11:38,733 --> 00:11:41,799
MONTEQUINTO

90
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,765
The signal source is only a few miles away.

91
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,565
In the area controlled by the montequinto army. Are you all ready?

92
00:12:03,566 --> 00:12:07,932
Sure! They always make fun of me because I choose the style, not the practicality!


93
00:12:07,933 --> 00:12:11,765
"But today I'm the most practical of them all!"
- We noticed, brother.


94
00:12:11,766 --> 00:12:14,765
Freud's grandfather would have accurately estimated the size he had chosen.

95
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,132
- I'm going first!
- Careful.

96
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:29,265
"Be careful" is for the losers!

97
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,232
The military is also coming here. We'll have ten minutes.

98
00:12:45,233 --> 00:12:48,932
There is no sign of Mr. nearby, but we must act as quickly as possible.

99
00:12:48,966 --> 00:12:51,465
They must not fall into their arms.

100
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,965
- Let's go there.
- He's closing us.

101
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,965
Here the alarm was broadcast all the time.

102
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:46,899
Someone tried to open the safe.


103
00:13:46,933 --> 00:13:49,665
But the plane went down before they reached.

104
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:52,432
To save the safe, no one could crash the plane.

105
00:13:52,466 --> 00:13:56,465
The idiots wanted to cut in the door. But I have an express method.

106
00:14:00,066 --> 00:14:01,299
Dominic.

107
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,099
There is no one nearby.

108
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:05,499
There is no sign of Nobody.

109
00:14:05,533 --> 00:14:07,232
Ready.

110
00:14:13,533 --> 00:14:18,332
- So what the hell is this?
"Who knows, but he wanted it to be with us."

111
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:20,265
How ...?

112
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,032
We're leaving here!

113
00:14:43,533 --> 00:14:45,499
They are there! They are there!

114
00:14:58,933 --> 00:15:01,899
Hey guys! Who are they up to?

115
00:15:01,933 --> 00:15:04,199
Do you think I'm scared?


116
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,299
Rome, where are you?

117
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:40,399
And how you like it, Freud, your mother!


118
00:17:03,733 --> 00:17:06,299
"Dangerous mines"? And what does that mean?

119
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,865
Test how fast you have to go.

120
00:17:07,866 --> 00:17:12,365
- No, that's a bad idea. Fuck, I want to live.
- So what does "dangerous mines" mean?

121
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,499
- Can we pass them?
- I don't know, brother.

122
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,365
Are you ignoring it?
What do these two words mean?

123
00:17:17,366 --> 00:17:19,732
I'm literally translating!
- Watch out, there are mines!

124
00:17:19,733 --> 00:17:21,499
What ?!

125
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,932
- Do you need speed?
- Considering the half-second start delay ...

126
00:17:26,933 --> 00:17:33,132
- ... and the radius of the explosion, we need 80 miles per hour.
- Fails! The speedometer has a maximum of 70!

127
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:33,999
What to do?

128
00:17:34,033 --> 00:17:37,599
Hit the gas hard! And pray!

129
00:17:45,533 --> 00:17:48,499
MINES

130
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,865
Let's go to the palm plantation, there are no mines!

131
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,665
To the mother ...!

132
00:19:23,066 --> 00:19:24,632
Rome, are you alive?

133
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,499
yes only my ass is on fire.

134
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,832
No! High! There is a mine!

135
00:20:55,466 --> 00:20:59,299
"How did you survive after that, my friend?"


136
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,965
I'm in shock too. Come on.

137
00:21:09,933 --> 00:21:12,132
You guys are ready to figure out how we can get away.

138
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:17,599
"There's a bridge on the border a few miles away."
-Cool! The sooner we get out of here, the better.

139
00:21:20,866 --> 00:21:24,932
Letty, be careful, it's true.


140
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,465
Where is the device?

141
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,899
get off

142
00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:46,499
That was Jacob, right?

143
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,699
The main road is ours, asshole!

144
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:23,865
- And this is a bridge ...?
- Do we have to go through this ...?!

145
00:23:23,866 --> 00:23:26,699
Well, yes, it's a bridge ... too narrow.

146
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,765
iiiMámiü!


147
00:24:01,233 --> 00:24:04,999
These maniacs will not leave us alone!
We have to go to the other side of the border!

148
00:25:01,866 --> 00:25:03,832
Where is the bridge?

149
00:25:08,166 --> 00:25:10,899
No, no! Do not you dare!

150
00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:47,665
What kind of father am I flying with ...

151
00:26:06,433 --> 00:26:08,732
The danger is over.

152
00:26:10,166 --> 00:26:12,565
But you made a lot of noise there.

153
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,099
The press has arrived.

154
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:17,565
- The spy plane crashed into enemy territory.

155
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,465
"And the special agents waged war there."

156
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:23,432
Of course I raise them ...

157
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:26,765
... but this is where my help ends.

158
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,899
Thanks for your help.

159
00:26:36,633 --> 00:26:39,465
It's time to finish the help.


160
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:43,999
And what's next, Ramsey?

161
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,565
HEARTS OpUOp V?

162
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:51,065
Well, I was able to decipher the data that was on Mr. Nobody's alarm ...

163
00:26:51,066 --> 00:26:52,932
... and I found the GPS coordinates there ...

164
00:26:52,966 --> 00:26:54,999
... obviously intentionally hidden.

165
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,099
Did you know about Jacob?

166
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:03,499
Question. Who is Jacob?

167
00:27:03,566 --> 00:27:08,299
Jacob ... Dominic's younger brother.

168
00:27:10,566 --> 00:27:14,499
Really? Curse!
I'm sorry, but that's too much.

169
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,765
Your brother?


170
00:27:17,666 --> 00:27:23,132
So you have a brother? Who else is megaspy?


171
00:27:23,133 --> 00:27:27,932
With your own pocket armor? Can you perform such crazy stunts?

172
00:27:27,966 --> 00:27:32,999
Jump into cars from high altitudes and land on an oncoming plane?

173
00:27:33,033 --> 00:27:34,899
f
He is ill?

174
00:27:34,933 --> 00:27:36,865
Not sick.

175
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,799
This is Toretto.

176
00:27:39,566 --> 00:27:40,965
My father is there!

177
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,565
My father is there!

178
00:27:43,366 --> 00:27:45,165
z
- She's dead!
- We have to get it out!

179
00:27:45,166 --> 00:27:50,165
Let me get it out! My father is there! My father is there!

180
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:59,032
My father is there! Save my father!
He's still alive! Save him! Please! Help him!

181
00:27:59,033 --> 00:28:00,799
My father is there!


182
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,665
You just have to sign
waiver of all claims.


183
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,932
And a few more letters.

184
00:28:15,333 --> 00:28:18,632
The car cover is there, in a special parking lot.

185
00:28:44,133 --> 00:28:45,165
Hey!

186
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:47,799
No one should touch it.

187
00:28:48,833 --> 00:28:50,665
Are you the youngest son of Toretto?

188
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,832
Unfortunate mediocrity.

189
00:29:00,533 --> 00:29:01,832
Now what?

190
00:29:01,833 --> 00:29:02,965
Get out.

191
00:29:03,333 --> 00:29:04,699
Get out!

192
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:08,332
Can't I say goodbye to the legend? Is that what you're talking about?

193
00:29:08,366 --> 00:29:09,999
No.

194
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,565
Not possible! You killed him!

195
00:29:12,566 --> 00:29:19,399
The race killed him. He knew I was hitting his back. He knew. And how he reacted after that ... I don't know.


196
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:22,832
- I swear ... if you don't disappear now ...

197
00:29:22,833 --> 00:29:25,099
-... You will have to ...
- Call Buddy.

198
00:29:25,133 --> 00:29:26,765
Fast!

199
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,932
Large! Now comes Father's pride.


200
00:29:38,366 --> 00:29:39,665
Get out of here.

201
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:43,632
Do you want to threaten me too?

202
00:29:43,666 --> 00:29:45,665
Please, I'm not threatening you.

203
00:29:46,566 --> 00:29:50,465
The Toretto family is always considered more sacred than the Pope!

204
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,265
Do you want to reveal a secret to you?

205
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:59,532
You, your father and I ... are in a boat.
And we will all be together until the end of the days.

206
00:29:59,766 --> 00:30:02,132
We have to agree.


207
00:30:03,833 --> 00:30:06,632
You're not with my dad.

208
00:30:07,766 --> 00:30:10,332
- But I'm alive, man.
-	What did you say?

209
00:30:10,333 --> 00:30:11,899
Fuck!

210
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:19,232
No, Dominic! Enough! Stop! Stop, calm down! You will kill me!

211
00:30:28,766 --> 00:30:31,299
Come on, your footprint.

212
00:30:36,666 --> 00:30:38,332
Come on

213
00:31:02,166 --> 00:31:03,632
Jacob!


214
00:31:03,666 --> 00:31:08,299
I can't believe the idea for the magnet worked. It turned out to be amazing.

215
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:11,132
Watch the video directly from the plane.

216
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,032
- Where to put ...?
- He ... almost caught up.

217
00:31:15,066 --> 00:31:16,199
Did you agree?

218
00:31:16,266 --> 00:31:17,832
No. Yet.

219
00:31:17,866 --> 00:31:20,999
When I see it, it turns on right away.


220
00:31:21,333 --> 00:31:24,899
But at the same time very scary. Strange, huh?

221
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,399
Thousand I II

222
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,065
I

223
00:31:28,366 --> 00:31:30,299
Excellent work.

224
00:31:30,566 --> 00:31:35,099
They were abducted from the plane in the air and crashed.

225
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,099
It's worth what I pay you.

226
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,332
Do you know who I am?

227
00:31:40,366 --> 00:31:42,265
Of course I know.

228
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,165
What about you

229
00:31:45,666 --> 00:31:49,499
Childhood in East Los Angeles is not Disneyiandia.


230
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:56,965
Also more talented in the shadow of your brother. Is that correct?

231
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:09,399
And all his life he tries to be faster than Dominic. Smarter than Dominic ... Stronger than Dominic.


232
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:15,599
It's true ... that I hate it
keep you awake at night ...?

233
00:32:17,666 --> 00:32:24,365
... and does it bother you ... even after all these years?

234
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,399
It was my fault that I last contacted his brother. I should contact you.

235
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:35,432
- I don't work in the race.
- Naive ...

236
00:32:35,433 --> 00:32:37,232
... to think that you are my competitor.

237
00:32:37,233 --> 00:32:40,299
Said the mouse out of the box.

238
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:40,899
I

239
00:32:42,166 --> 00:32:43,899
You want that?


240
00:32:44,233 --> 00:32:48,465
The second part was buried somewhere inside the Agency.

241
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:50,932
I want you to find it.


242
00:32:51,266 --> 00:32:54,532
To do this, remove the master plate from the plane.

243
00:32:54,966 --> 00:32:58,632
Everything else - comes from ancient times. In front of the internet.

244
00:32:58,933 --> 00:33:01,832
Not to pirate with what you are not asked to do.

245
00:33:03,733 --> 00:33:11,565
And if you get what you wanted ... a weapon that can wipe all of humanity off the face of the Earth ... what will it do?

246
00:33:11,566 --> 00:33:14,065
Are you going to do an apocalypse?

247
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:18,132
Do you sell to the most generous? Oh, I seem to know.

248
00:33:18,166 --> 00:33:21,799
He wants to shake the rotten system.


249
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:25,765
But in your heart you dream of being hugged.

250
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:30,832
- Did you find my school profile?
- I found everything. Even graduation photos.

251
00:33:31,866 --> 00:33:33,465
It's my job.

252
00:33:42,633 --> 00:33:46,932
He has ... a huge jaw.

253
00:33:47,833 --> 00:33:53,665
The Toretto family mixes a wide variety of blood, but its northern presence came as a real surprise.

254
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:02,832
Edinburgh The right component.

255
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:09,632
Finding two halves of the Ares project is as simple as peeling a pear. But he lures his brother into business ...

256
00:34:09,633 --> 00:34:11,399
■ ■ •
very unlikely.

257
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:14,232
Trust me, I can handle it.

258
00:34:18,066 --> 00:34:20,232
Hasa Han.

259
00:34:22,033 --> 00:34:23,932
What?

260
00:34:24,366 --> 00:34:26,365
Brother of Genghis Khan.

261
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,999
No one knew about it.

262
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:51,432
CASPIAN SEA

263
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:59,099
They hid very well.

264
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:03,399
yes whoever built this ... this guy was so paranoid.

265
00:35:03,933 --> 00:35:08,165
If all of a sudden the ninja turtles attack us, here I go!

266
00:35:08,166 --> 00:35:14,199
I don’t think the Agency would know about this hole. Mr. Nobody seems to be a secret nest.

267
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,699
What's next, Dominic?

268
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:28,832
We became Jacob eventually ...

269
00:35:30,133 --> 00:35:34,032
. and whatever you do or do ...

270
00:35:36,566 --> 00:35:38,832
My fault.

271
00:35:39,566 --> 00:35:41,199
And I have to fix it.


272
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:46,365
No. It's not that easy ... to get rid of us.

273
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,565
So, let's get to work.


274
00:36:03,633 --> 00:36:12,165
Strange business. We went through so many dangerous things. And ... yet ... we're still alive.

275
00:36:12,166 --> 00:36:14,432
yes, so far we have not twisted, we have not devoured.

276
00:36:14,433 --> 00:36:15,832
We were lucky.

277
00:36:15,866 --> 00:36:19,132
No, no, no, they don't understand. Just think about it!

278
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:23,799
We travel around the world, doing crazy tasks. And quite often.

279
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:31,199
We'll do ... what others think is fucking. And I don't have a damn scar.

280
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,565
Seriously! Take a look at my coat!

281
00:36:34,466 --> 00:36:39,032
Bullet holes. They wanted to blow my head off a lot of times!


282
00:36:39,033 --> 00:36:46,065
But they couldn't! We are obviously smarter than cars, trains and tanks. And any plane, compared to us, is a sparrow!

283
00:36:46,066 --> 00:36:50,065
- And we're all still alive ...
- I'm talking about this!

284
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:54,665
Ramsey, when tests of a theory give the same result, what does that mean?

285
00:36:54,666 --> 00:36:58,065
Let this hypothesis be a fact. But you don't mean ...

286
00:36:58,066 --> 00:37:03,265
I see, but ... when miracles happen again and again, it's not just luck.

287
00:37:04,166 --> 00:37:06,699
Maybe we're really special ...?


288
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:09,832
And that's what I think! Obviously, we are special!

289
00:37:10,333 --> 00:37:17,365
Well ... just to clarify ... you really think you're ...

290
00:37:17,366 --> 00:37:18,732
superheroes?

291
00:37:19,633 --> 00:37:22,365
- Maybe.
- Maybe.

292
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,965
But more likely

293
00:37:25,966 --> 00:37:28,565
■ ■ ■
that you're just crazy!

294
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:34,765
Your brain is as leaky as your coat.

295
00:37:42,366 --> 00:37:44,899
He did a great job today.

296
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:49,132
Do you miss your old life?

297
00:37:50,466 --> 00:37:51,765
What about you

298
00:37:54,066 --> 00:37:55,699
Every day.

299
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,799
Hello

300
00:37:59,833 --> 00:38:01,432
We have guests

301
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,965
No need to present.

302
00:38:05,633 --> 00:38:08,865
- Nice to see you new.
I missed them.

303
00:38:10,266 --> 00:38:12,199
Thanks.

304
00:38:12,233 --> 00:38:13,799
Willingly

305
00:38:17,066 --> 00:38:19,232
Why didn't you tell me?


306
00:38:20,133 --> 00:38:22,332
You have a right to know.

307
00:38:23,333 --> 00:38:26,765
Jacob and my brother. I couldn't help but come.

308
00:38:27,266 --> 00:38:30,632
By being involved in this matter, you are jeopardizing everything.

309
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:35,432
and to your new life
and his children.

310
00:38:35,733 --> 00:38:37,999
We are all risking something here.

311
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,765
Dominic, listen to me.

312
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,865
My children ... and your child is completely safe now.

313
00:38:45,866 --> 00:38:48,299
Brian is with them.

314
00:38:48,333 --> 00:38:50,265
We have something to save.


315
00:38:51,833 --> 00:38:54,199
And I am aware of the risks.

316
00:39:01,566 --> 00:39:07,299
The protection of these antiques proved to be adequate. But I uploaded it to the port and played with the protocols ...

317
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:10,565
I sank into the brain and

318
00:39:11,333 --> 00:39:13,699
... I'll introduce you to the Ares secret project.

319
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:16,699
- What is that?
- What we got safely out of the plane ...

320
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,732
... part of the project.

321
00:39:18,766 --> 00:39:22,465
Ares - can subdue any binary device.

322
00:39:22,466 --> 00:39:27,065
Any computer is vulnerable.
And it doesn’t matter where and how much protection you are under.


323
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:31,732
For example, if Arest loads a satellite, it spreads like a virus.

324
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:35,832
And then you can control any weapon ...

325
00:39:35,833 --> 00:39:40,532
... conventional, nuclear or new developments.
And you can apply them anywhere.

326
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,265
With that, Jacob ... will be the lord of the world ...


327
00:39:44,833 --> 00:39:46,765
... in an instant.

328
00:39:46,766 --> 00:39:51,199
Ares is the God of War, right? If Jacob takes control of Ares ...

329
00:39:51,233 --> 00:39:53,832
... to truly become God, and not good at all.


330
00:39:54,800 --> 00:40:00,265
To reduce the risks, Mr. No one withdrew the prototype and divided it into two equal parts.

331
00:40:00,266 --> 00:40:02,832
Both are useless without the activation key.

332
00:40:03,866 --> 00:40:08,199
Jacob has a party.
Now he's trying to find the other one.

333
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,065
But the key is missing.

334
00:40:10,633 --> 00:40:11,665
Disappeared.

335
00:40:11,666 --> 00:40:13,232
We will find it.

336
00:40:13,266 --> 00:40:16,532
But to catch up with Jacob, we have to be separate.


337
00:40:16,533 --> 00:40:21,932
Rome, Milk: My German friends help us get everything we may need.

338
00:40:21,966 --> 00:40:24,499
- Pack it up!
- Wait, there's one more thing.


339
00:40:24,533 --> 00:40:28,399
In Mr. Nobody's message, the name associated with the key was encrypted.

340
00:40:28,433 --> 00:40:31,199
Now it will be a surprise, you better sit down.

341
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,865
Not possible.

342
00:40:38,866 --> 00:40:41,032
I said exactly the same thing.

343
00:40:41,033 --> 00:40:44,899
So ... Khan's death is part of this crazy mix?

344
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:48,832
At least there is a connection. I'll take care of that.

345
00:40:48,866 --> 00:40:51,532
Milk, can you send me all the information about Khan?

346
00:40:51,966 --> 00:40:52,965
I'm going with you.

347
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,365
- Come on.
- Letty ...

348
00:40:58,266 --> 00:41:00,465
... I got this on the day of his death.

349
00:41:01,166 --> 00:41:02,632
Mexico.

350
00:41:03,166 --> 00:41:07,132
Now look at the stamp. That's the end of the clues.


351
00:41:07,133 --> 00:41:08,832
You have to find everything.

352
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:10,665
Tokyo

353
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,399
What did you decide about Jacob?

354
00:41:14,266 --> 00:41:15,965
I will find it.

355
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,365
How?

356
00:41:20,833 --> 00:41:22,665
With the help of a friend

357
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,765
But imagine ... that you could buy a house for a Chorizo? What can you buy then?

358
00:41:39,766 --> 00:41:41,599
Money is an illusion!

359
00:41:41,633 --> 00:41:46,665
Illusion ...? If you have too many illusions, I take them. You are not going anywhere without money! Money is a reality.

360
00:41:46,666 --> 00:41:48,332
- It's an illusion!
- Reality!

361
00:41:50,366 --> 00:41:53,799
Hey, what do you say?
Is money an illusion or a reality?

362
00:41:54,666 --> 00:41:58,632
Does not matter.
It's just a matter of perception.

363
00:41:58,633 --> 00:42:00,832
Here! I was right again!

364
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,865
- I'm Leo.
- I'm Santos.

365
00:42:03,866 --> 00:42:05,199
I'm Dominic.

366
00:42:05,466 --> 00:42:07,765
- Why are they locked up?
- Not white.

367
00:42:07,766 --> 00:42:12,065
- And for the bank robbery.
- You don't understand anything!

368
00:42:12,066 --> 00:42:16,532
The police stopped us because we are black! And not because we robbed the bank.

369
00:42:16,866 --> 00:42:19,999
- Okay ... you're right about that.
- Oh, stop, stop, be careful.

370
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,765
There is a crack in the fuel line.

371
00:42:22,766 --> 00:42:25,765
If air enters - the car will drown.

372
00:42:25,766 --> 00:42:27,432
This ...

373
00:42:27,466 --> 00:42:30,832
An old trick mechanic is manipulating a car race.

374
00:42:30,866 --> 00:42:37,565
But if the crack gets bigger and sparks come ... everything will explode to hell.

375
00:43:18,633 --> 00:43:21,999
Hey dude, you're the best!

376
00:43:23,533 --> 00:43:25,165
Who is next?

377
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,765
Who will challenge me?

378
00:43:26,766 --> 00:43:28,465
I try.

379
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:31,965
Dominic?

380
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,099
When did he get out of jail?

381
00:43:35,566 --> 00:43:37,299
Are we talking or driving?

382
00:43:39,066 --> 00:43:41,665
All right, Dominic.

383
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:44,265
Do you want to call Buddy in the trash?

384
00:43:44,266 --> 00:43:46,599
The driver is more important than the car.

385
00:43:53,533 --> 00:43:55,565
The conditions are as follows.

386
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,899
If you win ...

387
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,232
you come home.

388
00:44:00,266 --> 00:44:07,465
If you lose ... you run from here ... and you never come back ...


389
00:44:07,833 --> 00:44:09,665
'eouriN

390
00:44:10,433 --> 00:44:12,132
What is this nonsense, brother?

391
00:44:12,133 --> 00:44:14,165
I know what you did.

392
00:44:15,633 --> 00:44:21,665
The same day, my father complained about engine failures. You remember?

393
00:44:21,966 --> 00:44:24,865
You last got under the hood.

394
00:44:26,866 --> 00:44:29,232
And he died a minute later.

395
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:33,265
Tell me why you killed Dad.

396
00:44:40,066 --> 00:44:42,699
Let's go now.

397
00:44:47,366 --> 00:44:50,399
Robbery in the Eco-Park!
The 4th Street Bridge is free!

398
00:44:50,433 --> 00:44:51,865
Come on, come on, come on!

399
00:44:51,866 --> 00:44:53,899
Fuck!

400
00:45:10,966 --> 00:45:12,999
For your tickets ...


401
00:45:13,533 --> 00:45:14,932
Attention!

402
00:45:15,966 --> 00:45:17,432
Now!

403
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:44,132
Too early

404
00:46:51,833 --> 00:46:54,365
No!

405
00:47:52,966 --> 00:47:55,465
Nothing has changed here.

406
00:47:57,466 --> 00:48:00,199
I left everything as it was with Jack.

407
00:48:00,233 --> 00:48:02,099
I'm looking for Jacob.

408
00:48:06,833 --> 00:48:08,599
There is no possibility.


409
00:48:09,866 --> 00:48:13,465
I know you took it after my father died.

410
00:48:13,766 --> 00:48:16,732
Toretto's worst dream ...

411
00:48:16,766 --> 00:48:19,199
it is the expulsion of the family.

412
00:48:20,433 --> 00:48:23,065
And that's what you did to him.

413
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:28,165
Some people love you, wait for you, care about you.

414
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:34,465
Jacob has no one. Your hostility will not end until one of you dies.


415
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:37,065
I know you did what was best for him, you cared about him.

416
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:40,832
But we both understand that something is going wrong.

417
00:48:50,666 --> 00:48:53,832
As much as I could, I helped Jacob.

418
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:58,299
But I'm not Jack Toretto.

419
00:49:14,666 --> 00:49:18,399
So they have a chance for the future ...

420
00:49:19,466 --> 00:49:21,799
they must accept the past.


421
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:31,599
He's in London.

422
00:49:31,633 --> 00:49:33,332
That's all I know

423
00:49:44,033 --> 00:49:46,099
Dominic.

424
00:49:49,233 --> 00:49:53,365
I hope they reconciled.

425
00:49:54,666 --> 00:49:58,265
The last chance to die in this race.

426
00:50:06,233 --> 00:50:09,099
TOKYO

427
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:23,132
Origato.

428
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:31,032
- I think we're at a dead end.
"Does Jacob know that Khan is involved in the project?"

429
00:50:32,166 --> 00:50:36,899
If you have the same information as us ... then you know.

430
00:50:38,933 --> 00:50:42,732
Dominic didn't know ...

431
00:50:42,866 --> 00:50:46,365
... that I kept my relationship with Jacob a secret.

432
00:50:46,933 --> 00:50:52,832
He lived with Buddy for a year ... then ... he disappeared, leaving a note where he asked not to look for him.


433
00:50:53,533 --> 00:50:59,065
After such a strange act, I was willing to do anything to find it.

434
00:50:59,066 --> 00:51:02,232
I even went into the police file, but ... it didn't help me.


435
00:51:02,233 --> 00:51:05,399
Really? At the age of sixteen?

436
00:51:06,566 --> 00:51:08,599
I wanted to find it.

437
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:11,565
sure

438
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:15,899
And how are you?

439
00:51:15,933 --> 00:51:17,532
In general?

440
00:51:18,266 --> 00:51:20,699
Is quiet life over?

441
00:51:21,833 --> 00:51:25,999
I just remembered

442
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,765
Who am I

443
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:33,032
Everything has changed a lot. And it slowed down.

444
00:51:33,833 --> 00:51:41,532
I only find peace in chaos. I have to collide with the world to feel alive.


445
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:49,399
I watch Brian rush ... to hide from the armed intruders ...

446
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:52,199
■ ■ ■
I got up.

447
00:51:53,433 --> 00:51:56,932
To hide - not for us.

448
00:51:57,466 --> 00:52:01,832
Dominic is my brother, but he can always trust me.


449
00:52:01,933 --> 00:52:05,699
You and I have something we don’t have to talk about.

450
00:52:11,466 --> 00:52:12,799
What?

451
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,199
I can not believe my eyes ...

452
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:16,965
What are you talking about?

453
00:52:17,066 --> 00:52:20,132
Remember what Han always said about Tokyo?

454
00:52:22,366 --> 00:52:27,132
He joked that in the old westerns, cowboys ran out of justice in Mexico.

455
00:52:27,433 --> 00:52:30,199
Tokyo was Mexico.

456
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:35,665
Oops.


457
00:52:40,033 --> 00:52:45,432
RETROPULSION INVESTIGATION AREA. SUBURB. GERMANY.

458
00:52:52,033 --> 00:52:53,965
The car is ready to fight.

459
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,565
Wait ... No! No! John!

460
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:00,632
Why did you make a valve for the liquid oxygen tube?


461
00:53:00,633 --> 00:53:05,665
Brother, don't worry, this is a significant step forward. Everything will be great. So I won us half a second.

462
00:53:05,666 --> 00:53:09,365
Do not worry ?! This is not a bloody fighter! You can't get out of the car!

463
00:53:09,366 --> 00:53:11,532
My friend, calm down. Everything will be great.

464
00:53:11,533 --> 00:53:15,265
When he discovers what is happening due to excessive pressure ... he tells his opinion.

465
00:53:15,266 --> 00:53:16,832
But now
do not participate.


466
00:53:16,833 --> 00:53:19,399
But you said, "Stay out of it, genius!" Certain?

467
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:23,832
I was reminded of the use of rocket engines. And how to make money from it.

468
00:53:24,133 --> 00:53:27,199
- That's my idea.
-Who do you entrust your incarnation to?

469
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,365
Is this the crazy mechanic?

470
00:53:30,133 --> 00:53:34,499
Or a rocket scientist? If it weren’t for me, you’d be changing the oil in an fryer now!

471
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:37,265
Guys, calm down. Why fight? We all contribute.

472
00:53:37,266 --> 00:53:40,732
Your only contribution is that you pee every time you take off, you silly orc.

473
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,899
Did I hear correctly?

474
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:45,199
Are you an aerophobic smuggler?


475
00:53:46,533 --> 00:53:48,199
Are you the silent orc?

476
00:53:48,233 --> 00:53:52,665
So ... you two ... the wise leprechaun and the giant hobbit?

477
00:53:53,033 --> 00:53:56,132
I ... I'm not offended by the nickname "orc".


478
00:53:56,133 --> 00:53:58,365
So ... are you tolerant of orcs?

479
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,699
Aren't you ashamed?

480
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:01,999
He's not serious.

481
00:54:02,566 --> 00:54:04,299
Time for you guys!

482
00:54:04,333 --> 00:54:05,765
Large!

483
00:54:06,933 --> 00:54:08,265
Did you hear?

484
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,465
More than a quarter of a mile in ten seconds?

485
00:54:11,866 --> 00:54:14,965
And our car can do it. For two damn seconds!

486
00:54:22,233 --> 00:54:26,899
They put a rocket engine in a Pontiac Viera ...?

487
00:54:26,933 --> 00:54:28,899
Cool? I know.

488
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:31,765
No ... Dude ... it's not cool at all.

489
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:36,865
Come on, take it out! The competition begins!


490
00:54:52,766 --> 00:54:55,632
Take it off! Go! Go! Go!

491
00:55:12,066 --> 00:55:13,199
Cool!

492
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,199
Yes!

493
00:55:15,633 --> 00:55:17,765
We did it! Yes!

494
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:20,332
Yes, friends, we did it!

495
00:55:23,166 --> 00:55:26,565
Mm
Why are they so happy?

496
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:28,832
The machine clearly won them.

497
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:30,132
The car did not explode.

498
00:55:30,166 --> 00:55:31,932
It didn't even melt.

499
00:55:31,966 --> 00:55:33,999
It stands like new.

500
00:55:39,633 --> 00:55:41,765
Fireworks to the top?

501
00:55:41,766 --> 00:55:43,965
Well, I already warned you.

502
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,532
But you are deaf.

503
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:49,499
We were secretly told ...
Can you get the cars?

504
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:52,032
Just please ...
these are not the cars that explode ...

505
00:55:52,533 --> 00:55:53,932
Can they do it?


506
00:55:53,966 --> 00:55:59,032
- Mortgage office three miles from here. "Dominic Toretto sent us.

507
00:56:06,566 --> 00:56:08,632
Who the hell is Toretto?

508
00:56:10,166 --> 00:56:12,732
London


509
00:57:02,033 --> 00:57:04,265
Beautiful necklace, Magdalene.

510
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:08,299
Diamonds and emeralds look very good on you.

511
00:57:08,966 --> 00:57:11,132
Dominic Toretto ...

512
00:57:13,166 --> 00:57:15,832
I heard they were put in jail.

513
00:57:15,866 --> 00:57:18,465
But I didn't stay there long.

514
00:57:18,866 --> 00:57:22,965
They will never learn ...
that the cage does not belong to all birds.

515
00:57:22,966 --> 00:57:25,265
Are you looking for one of my children?

516
00:57:26,166 --> 00:57:27,999
You had no idea.

517
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:31,699
Take it and 15 percent of the sale is yours.

518
00:57:35,033 --> 00:57:35,699
4

519
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:37,965
I stopped this a long time ago.

520
00:57:38,833 --> 00:57:40,265
But not ...

521
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,999
So ... are you going with me?


522
00:58:15,066 --> 00:58:17,165
Looking for somebody.


523
00:58:17,366 --> 00:58:19,499
He came here recently.

524
00:58:19,633 --> 00:58:21,532
And with a great team.

525
00:58:21,533 --> 00:58:23,099
With lots of money and connections.

526
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:27,799
Anyway, yes, here’s a foreign team in which the boss is American.

527
00:58:30,566 --> 00:58:32,699
.

528
00:58:33,233 --> 00:58:39,099
He bought a gun from a local dealer and heard that there was something serious in Edinburgh.

529
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,665
c / k a local seller, huh?

530
00:58:45,966 --> 00:58:48,632
Who likes to steal the most expensive trinkets?

531
00:58:48,633 --> 00:58:51,665
He gave me a lot, I’m not stupid if I refuse money.

532
00:58:56,266 --> 00:59:00,765
It was about its height.
And he looked very much like you.


533
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:04,732
Oh, damn it. Did I confuse you with your cousin?

534
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:07,232
With my brother.

535
00:59:10,166 --> 00:59:12,865
Honey, apply the parking brake.

536
00:59:21,166 --> 00:59:25,132
It turned out
not only my relatives are crazy.

537
00:59:26,033 --> 00:59:29,632
z
He offered you money

00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,799

.
TO
obsession

541
00:59:59,766 --> 01:00:03,265
For man, nothing is more important than the love of his family.

542
01:00:03,833 --> 01:00:06,899
But it turned love into anger.

543
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:10,265
And there is nothing more dangerous.

544
01:00:13,333 --> 01:00:14,599
you

545
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:16,065
Dominic?

546
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:20,899
Don't let him kill you.
You are my favorite American.

547
01:00:25,966 --> 01:00:28,299
.

548
01:00:34,933 --> 01:00:36,499
.

549
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:48,699
I think you like this party?


550
01:00:48,733 --> 01:00:52,999
The best girls, the best cars.
All the best. And the best security.

551
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,065
I'm Otto, your brother's partner.

552
01:01:00,733 --> 01:01:07,332
Specifically, I am your investor.
But since my father is a dictator, I am not any rich child. No no no.

553
01:01:07,333 --> 01:01:12,232
Everything you see here is mine! Even the girls. If you want one or two or three ...

554
01:01:12,233 --> 01:01:15,999
... Just tell me. They are in payroll. In addition, I pay them for the dentist.

555
01:01:16,333 --> 01:01:17,065
Do you understand

556
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:18,332
Where is Jacob?

557
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:20,032
In the palace.

558
01:02:00,066 --> 01:02:02,465
The brother you met ...

559
01:02:02,966 --> 01:02:04,832
... is in the past.

560
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:07,032
He is not here.


561
01:02:07,266 --> 01:02:11,699
And I still see the same coward who killed my father.

562
01:02:12,866 --> 01:02:14,432
You are very wrong.

563
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:18,099
Don't neglect your back

564
01:02:18,966 --> 01:02:21,065
... in my world.

565
01:02:25,333 --> 01:02:28,465
My suggestion

566
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:31,432
... it used to be the same as yours.

567
01:02:33,733 --> 01:02:36,565
Get out of here. Just now.

568
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:39,032
Without speech.

569
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:41,565
And he never comes back.

570
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,099
Never

571
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:45,099
wake up

572
01:02:45,933 --> 01:02:48,132
I was sorry that day!

573
01:02:50,133 --> 01:02:51,932
But don't expect more mercy from me.

574
01:02:56,333 --> 01:02:59,099
- Here!
- The object is here.

575
01:03:02,033 --> 01:03:03,732
iToretto!

576
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:07,299
My father is the head of state.


577
01:03:07,333 --> 01:03:09,832
And I'm a senior man.


578
01:03:09,866 --> 01:03:17,299
This is the palace embassy. It turned out that you entered my country for the purpose of murder.

579
01:03:17,333 --> 01:03:21,299
Of course, I had to go to Interpol for help.

580
01:03:21,333 --> 01:03:24,365
If you continue to delve into the past ...

581
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:26,332
you dig your own grave.

582
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:37,565
Well, I was nervous about my idiot father.

583
01:03:38,133 --> 01:03:41,465
But your family ... damn ... even crazier.

584
01:03:41,833 --> 01:03:46,465
Well ... we neutralized your brother. Time to go through Edinburgh ...

585
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:50,365
... for the second part of Ares.
And then ... it's not a sin to relax, is it?

586
01:03:52,366 --> 01:03:55,999
- And the key?
- My people will get it soon.


587
01:03:58,100 --> 01:04:03,965
In a week ... no great power will be able to urinate without our permission.

588
01:04:03,966 --> 01:04:07,599
In a week ... your father will beg you to lend him the money.

589
01:04:08,066 --> 01:04:09,999
It would be good.

590
01:04:10,366 --> 01:04:12,432
I can not wait.

591
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:27,665
Dominic!

592
01:04:27,833 --> 01:04:30,199
How are you handsome boy? Ah?

593
01:04:30,633 --> 01:04:32,665
Thank you very much, Leisa.

594
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:36,565
Seriously! If it weren't for you, I'd still steal gasoline in my country.

595
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:41,432
"How about working with Magdalena?"
- I'm like a princess there. As his best student.

596
01:04:41,433 --> 01:04:44,332
- Kara's sister is a fire.
- Fire?

597
01:04:44,333 --> 01:04:48,165
Did you see my ass in a dress? So shut up if you don't understand!

598
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:52,565
This whole team is my daughters! You understand? I brought them from all over the world.

599
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:53,932
I almost forgot.

600
01:04:53,966 --> 01:04:55,665
Van. It will be useful.

601
01:04:55,700 --> 01:05:01,165
The weapon is programmed according to your brother's biometric data. Now you can find it without any problems.

602
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:40,365
Hey, Letty.

603
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:43,765
- what?
-	Seeing.

604
01:05:45,266 --> 01:05:46,665
Who is he?

605
01:05:47,533 --> 01:05:49,599
Han never mentioned it.

606
01:05:51,166 --> 01:05:52,332
Letty, Mia!

607
01:05:53,433 --> 01:05:54,432
On the ground, fast!

608
01:07:06,166 --> 01:07:07,165
What ...

609
01:07:50,333 --> 01:07:51,499
Are you okay

610
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:23,399

Welcome to the cathedral.


617
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:21,532
The history of this holy place dates back more than 9 centuries.

618
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:23,999
First of all, it is famous for ...

619
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:31,565
Everything is ready.

620
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,699
Ramsey, right?

621
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:43,032
I copied Jakob's biometric data from his gun.

622
01:09:43,033 --> 01:09:46,399
The program indicates that your people are a stone’s throw away from us.

623
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:48,199
Within a radius of about one hundred meters.

624
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:49,532
About a hundred meters?

625
01:09:49,533 --> 01:09:51,299
yes, there is room.

626
01:09:51,733 --> 01:09:53,865
There are really a lot of people here.

627
01:09:54,433 --> 01:09:55,499
Then.


628
01:09:55,766 --> 01:10:00,532
You obviously don't know where he is
the secret safe Jacob wants to blow up?

629
01:10:00,533 --> 01:10:02,832
That's why it was called a secret.

630
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:04,199
Clean.


631
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:08,632
He read a lot of books, braided braids, wore glasses, but he didn’t get smarter.

632
01:10:13,766 --> 01:10:16,865
It’s weird that we didn’t use a good old beacon

633
01:10:16,866 --> 01:10:19,232
That would have led us directly to this guy.

634
01:10:19,233 --> 01:10:23,732
But not! Instead, we’re confused with biometrics and facial recognition!

635
01:10:23,733 --> 01:10:27,199
Now, like idiots, we are looking for a white man in a white room.


636
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:29,232
yes, true, but there is a detail.

637
01:10:29,233 --> 01:10:30,665
They are always attentive to the marker.

638
01:10:30,666 --> 01:10:35,265
This means they can discover the dry cleaner where the pants were brought with this beacon.


639
01:10:35,266 --> 01:10:38,365
But with biometrics, it’s impossible to shit that.

640
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:40,899
What
■ ■ ■

641
01:10:41,433 --> 01:10:43,199
Guys, I ... We have a problem.

642
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:44,732
All cameras are broken.

643
01:10:44,733 --> 01:10:46,499
And the technique is flawed.

644
01:10:48,866 --> 01:10:50,232
Jimmy, what the hell?

645
01:10:50,933 --> 01:10:52,832
Alarm, the cameras don't work!

646
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:56,665
Damn it

647
01:10:56,933 --> 01:10:58,265
Do you see anything strange?

648
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:00,165
Where do we start?


649
01:11:00,333 --> 01:11:03,432
First of all, I feel weird around these tourists.

650
01:11:03,766 --> 01:11:05,965
And those two women out there are outraged.

651
01:11:05,966 --> 01:11:09,799
They want to look like George and Washington sexy.

652
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:12,565
I feel like I'm on Count Dracula's birthday.


653
01:11:24,933 --> 01:11:28,699
Ramsey, we've been around every corner ... we've already got real calluses!

654
01:11:28,700 --> 01:11:29,999
And nothing!

655
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,432
- Wow!
-	What?

656
01:11:32,966 --> 01:11:33,965
Did you notice?

657
01:11:33,966 --> 01:11:35,065
What are you talking about?

658
01:11:35,366 --> 01:11:36,265
The ears.

659
01:11:36,766 --> 01:11:38,465
It's broken many times.

660
01:11:38,833 --> 01:11:40,399
These guys are warriors.

661
01:11:42,466 --> 01:11:43,699
To see.

662
01:11:43,700 --> 01:11:44,732
Roman!

663
01:11:44,733 --> 01:11:47,232
Hey brother, I asked you for shoes.

664
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:50,065
Three weeks have passed and still nothing!

665
01:11:54,433 --> 01:11:55,965
Consider my opinion!

666
01:11:58,700 --> 01:12:01,265
Do we think first and act later?

667
01:12:02,733 --> 01:12:05,799
Dominic, go quickly to the cathedral.

668
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:08,999
Our genius hit the messengers, he didn’t like their ears.

669
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:12,665
Stop, stop, stop.

670
01:12:12,933 --> 01:12:14,765
How much did you pay for it?

671
01:12:16,233 --> 01:12:18,632
Platinum does not appear to be magnetized.

672
01:12:19,266 --> 01:12:20,699
shut up, please.

673
01:12:20,833 --> 01:12:22,265
I'm tired of me!

674
01:12:22,733 --> 01:12:26,365
Ramsey, for example, has a huge electromagnet on the truck.


675
01:12:27,166 --> 01:12:29,765
It disrupts the technique, doesn't it?

676
01:12:29,766 --> 01:12:31,565
Including security systems.

677
01:12:31,566 --> 01:12:34,665
I found out ... That's how Jakob would enter the safe!

678
01:12:38,766 --> 01:12:41,199
Guys! Hello?

679
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:48,332
Police officers flew in from all directions, closing the district.

680
01:12:48,333 --> 01:12:50,065
He won't get away with a car.

681
01:13:04,366 --> 01:13:05,899
Ramsey, I saw Jacob.

682
01:13:14,766 --> 01:13:16,032
I see Otto.

683
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:19,399
I'm looking.

684
01:13:28,900 --> 01:13:30,732
He goes out with a blue Jaguar.

685
01:13:30,733 --> 01:13:31,865
Follow me!

686
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:33,965
Me? I can not!

687
01:13:33,966 --> 01:13:34,932
Why

688
01:13:34,933 --> 01:13:37,499
Okay, it's not time, but ...

689
01:13:37,766 --> 01:13:40,499
I don't have permission. I don't know how to drive. Absolutely.


690
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:42,699
Few people in London drive.

691
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:45,132
I thought you needed something else.

692
01:13:45,133 --> 01:13:46,765
- Isn't that right?
- And who else?

693
01:14:00,166 --> 01:14:01,299
Jolin.

694
01:14:01,700 --> 01:14:04,465
Guys, that's enough, we can always agree.

695
01:14:04,766 --> 01:14:06,265
And with everyone. Truth?

696
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:17,099
Okay, how can that be ...

697
01:14:24,366 --> 01:14:26,932
Ramsey, cut off the magnet!

698
01:14:29,366 --> 01:14:30,565
Come on, fast!

699
01:14:32,066 --> 01:14:34,599
The brake is on the left and the accelerator pedal is on the right.

700
01:14:37,233 --> 01:14:38,299
Fuck ...

701
01:15:30,833 --> 01:15:31,865
Fuck!

702
01:15:49,533 --> 01:15:51,032
It was unintentional!

703
01:16:35,266 --> 01:16:36,332
God!

704
01:16:39,066 --> 01:16:40,432
I'm sorry!


705
01:16:40,866 --> 01:16:42,665
Definitely not my fault!

706
01:16:50,900 --> 01:16:53,032
And here I am definitely mine.


707
01:17:28,466 --> 01:17:30,865
You see! I told you!

708
01:17:31,266 --> 01:17:32,765
Not a single scratch!

709
01:17:47,166 --> 01:17:48,965
iOtto, send new coordinates!

710
01:17:56,633 --> 01:17:58,665
Accepted, I come to you.

711
01:18:38,266 --> 01:18:39,332
Otto, where are you?

712
01:18:39,866 --> 01:18:41,732
I'm coming, but I can't see you.

713
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:46,065
You made a bad street.

714
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:21,732
This is my cochom!

715
01:19:21,733 --> 01:19:23,199
iDominic!

716
01:19:26,833 --> 01:19:27,899
Go further!

717
01:19:32,166 --> 01:19:33,165
Fuck!

718
01:20:05,433 --> 01:20:06,699
You have talent.

719
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:09,165
Did you doubt it?

720
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:25,465
Listen to me!
I need 50 best fighters.

721
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:27,632
Armed with cars.

722
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,165
And with fighters even better.

723
01:20:30,166 --> 01:20:32,865
Even with the starship with Chewbacca, if you succeeded.


724
01:20:32,966 --> 01:20:34,365
I'll pay for everything, hair.

725
01:20:35,533 --> 01:20:36,599
Live!


726
01:20:46,900 --> 01:20:48,032
What?

727
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:51,265
What do you find funny?

728
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:53,799
For me ...

729
01:20:55,066 --> 01:20:57,832
I was reminded of a regular movie scene.

730
01:20:57,833 --> 01:20:58,399
I
v *
I

731
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:02,665
Just the moment the villain bounces off losing his plans.

732
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:07,665
He starts doing nonsense and eventually the main characters get their heads.

733
01:21:09,466 --> 01:21:10,699
There is no crime

734
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:14,099
But you have no idea about our plans.

735
01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:17,165
Here we are the main characters.

736
01:21:17,466 --> 01:21:19,665
I'm like Luck, the fucking Skywaiker.

737
01:21:19,733 --> 01:21:21,165
Are you sure you weren't wrong?

738
01:21:22,100 --> 01:21:24,399
You already have a conflict with your father ^ but ...

739
01:21:26,333 --> 01:21:27,699
Evaluate your progress.

740
01:21:29,833 --> 01:21:31,632
Are you sure you're Skywaiker?

741
01:21:32,900 --> 01:21:33,932
You're right.

742
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:36,465
I'm more of a Han Solo.

743
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:38,765
No
«■ ■

744
01:21:41,466 --> 01:21:43,599
- You're Yoda.
- Yoda?

745
01:21:44,766 --> 01:21:46,765
- No, green monster?
- Yes.

746
01:21:46,766 --> 01:21:47,865
No.

747
01:21:49,166 --> 01:21:50,732
Oh, I see.

748
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:54,065
Because he's the best Jedi, right?

749
01:21:54,066 --> 01:21:54,965
No.

750
01:21:55,966 --> 01:21:57,599
Because it's a baby.

751
01:21:59,833 --> 01:22:01,965
Fucked from her ass.

752
01:22:26,033 --> 01:22:27,432
What shall we do?

753
01:22:28,133 --> 01:22:30,165
There is no escape from the past.

754
01:22:31,066 --> 01:22:32,865
And yours got to you too.

755
01:22:42,533 --> 01:22:48,665
Shit I've never seen such strong civilian or military electromagnets.

756
01:22:48,666 --> 01:22:51,765
- And his power is unreal.
- Exactly.

757
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:52,732
.

758
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:54,799
Hey, do you want a joke?

759
01:23:12,233 --> 01:23:14,465
- His face now ...
- Do you think it's funny?

760
01:23:15,366 --> 01:23:16,599
I'm hungry!

761
01:23:16,766 --> 01:23:18,365
Hi there.

762
01:23:18,566 --> 01:23:19,765
We have guests.

763
01:23:23,666 --> 01:23:24,965
Fucking bunker.

764
01:23:36,533 --> 01:23:37,665
So many years

765
01:23:59,866 --> 01:24:01,465
Did you get the postcard?

766
01:24:19,900 --> 01:24:22,065
I can't believe it.

767
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:24,365
How to survive

768
01:24:27,166 --> 01:24:29,065
After Gisele died, I ...

769
01:24:30,433 --> 01:24:32,332
He didn't know how to live.

770
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:35,099
Why fight
■ ■ ■

771
01:24:36,533 --> 01:24:38,365
- Disappeared.
-	Naturally.

772
01:24:38,366 --> 01:24:42,365
Can you tell me how you survived the car explosion?

773
01:24:42,366 --> 01:24:44,299
Very strong I want to know.


774
01:24:44,300 --> 01:24:47,299
Roman, can you catch me once?

775
01:24:47,633 --> 01:24:49,165
We had plans.

776
01:24:50,766 --> 01:24:52,432
And we had dreams.

777
01:24:52,433 --> 01:24:54,932
Well, what's our next adventure?


778
01:24:57,433 --> 01:25:00,699
Maybe we can try to settle somewhere?

779
01:25:01,833 --> 01:25:02,965
But exactly where?

780
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:06,699
In Tokyo. We dream of living in Tokyo.

781
01:25:07,300 --> 01:25:08,899
Good choice.

782
01:25:10,266 --> 01:25:12,699
Our dreams took me there.

783
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:15,599
Tokyo at last

784
01:25:18,066 --> 01:25:19,699
It became my home.

785
01:25:21,300 --> 01:25:23,665
But one day Mr. Nobody came for me.

786
01:25:23,933 --> 01:25:25,499
I worked with Gisele.


787
01:25:25,866 --> 01:25:30,799
As a CIA employee, he fought local drug cartels in Central America.

788
01:25:32,300 --> 01:25:33,799
Good times

789
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:35,599
He was the best on the team.

790
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:38,465
An agent can die at any moment.

791
01:25:40,133 --> 01:25:42,999
Of bullets, knives or strangulation.

792
01:25:43,833 --> 01:25:47,599
But Gisele was deceived by her love for you.

793
01:25:51,866 --> 01:25:52,765
What do you need?


794
01:25:52,966 --> 01:25:55,832
I want to offer you a job. They have.

795
01:25:56,166 --> 01:25:58,099
Here in Tokyo.

796
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:02,065
- Why me?
- I saw how they worked together.

797
01:26:02,066 --> 01:26:04,565
I realized he trusted you.

798
01:26:05,900 --> 01:26:08,165
That means I can trust you too.


799
01:26:08,866 --> 01:26:13,865
And this is very rare in our difficult business.

800
01:26:19,466 --> 01:26:23,865
The first task was to steal a technology from a family of scientists.

801
01:26:27,900 --> 01:26:32,599
But, as usual, Mr. Nobody said everything.

802
01:26:34,100 --> 01:26:36,632
He silenced the most important thing.

803
01:26:41,666 --> 01:26:43,165
I was 11 years old.

804
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:49,165
My parents took me to the movies on Saturday when I got good grades at school.


805
01:26:50,300 --> 01:26:54,265
But one day, before I left, I forgot to bring my raincoat.

806
01:26:54,933 --> 01:26:56,465
I had to go back.

807
01:27:02,666 --> 01:27:04,665
And I didn't find it right away.

808
01:27:06,833 --> 01:27:09,232
I heard an explosion and looked out the window.


809
01:27:12,433 --> 01:27:14,199
Mom and Dad died.

810
01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:16,899
Turns out I wasn’t the only one looking for this thing.

811
01:27:26,766 --> 01:27:29,732
Kill him! We don't need witnesses.

812
01:27:37,366 --> 01:27:38,999
That's it, I found it.

813
01:27:40,466 --> 01:27:41,465
Here.

814
01:27:44,533 --> 01:27:45,665
Hide!

815
01:27:55,600 --> 01:28:02,465
Han saved me. Realizing that they will always hunt me now ...

816
01:28:02,666 --> 01:28:04,199
He taught me to survive.

817
01:28:06,666 --> 01:28:08,499
I became my family.

818
01:28:11,233 --> 01:28:13,065
Are they always hunting?

819
01:28:14,866 --> 01:28:15,865
Why

820
01:28:16,466 --> 01:28:18,099
Because he's the key.


821
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:24,932
Everyone was looking for a lifeless object.

822
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:28,399
And the key turned out to be a person.


823
01:28:29,366 --> 01:28:32,899
Parents feared the Ares project would fall into the wrong hands.

824
01:28:32,900 --> 01:28:34,899
And they put their key in their DNA.

825
01:28:35,066 --> 01:28:36,499
And I'm her daughter.

826
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:42,499
Then Mr. Nobody gave me information that one of his agents was a traitor.

827
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:44,799
And when Deckard Shaw appeared ...

828
01:28:45,666 --> 01:28:47,065
We use it.

829
01:28:52,666 --> 01:28:56,032
But he died in that accident, Han.

830
01:28:57,666 --> 01:29:00,199
Mr. No one is a master of special effects.

831
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:09,632
The performance was very spectacular.

832
01:29:10,766 --> 01:29:12,299
It was still better.

833
01:29:14,566 --> 01:29:16,765
Stay dead


834
01:29:18,733 --> 01:29:20,132
It will be harder.

835
01:29:22,966 --> 01:29:24,199
My death


836
01:29:24,633 --> 01:29:26,899
That was the only way to survive.

837
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:35,599
- What the hell?
- The program has started, it looks like a virus.

838
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:42,665
Look at me, look at me!

839
01:29:45,466 --> 01:29:46,532
Stop!

840
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:00,765
Well done, don't move.

841
01:30:01,133 --> 01:30:05,065
If you don’t move, everyone will still survive.

842
01:30:11,266 --> 01:30:12,465
Jakob.

843
01:30:13,700 --> 01:30:15,132
Sorry, Mia.

844
01:30:19,033 --> 01:30:20,532
I'm the traitor.

845
01:30:21,633 --> 01:30:22,632
Surprised?

846
01:30:23,633 --> 01:30:26,099
Didn't you think Mr. Nobody came to you?

847
01:30:26,166 --> 01:30:28,732
Do you think he chose you for no reason?

848
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:32,665
For years, he supervised and carried out his missions from here.

849
01:30:35,533 --> 01:30:37,832
I've been looking for this key for a long time.


850
01:30:39,633 --> 01:30:41,132
But you brought it to me.


851
01:30:42,366 --> 01:30:43,632
I already told you.

852
01:30:44,966 --> 01:30:46,399
Watch out, brother.

853
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:48,532
Here.

854
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:51,632
He has a great team.

855
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:53,699
Do you trust them?

856
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:55,365
I trust that.

857
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:03,265
Do you know what's good about a father's death?

858
01:31:05,966 --> 01:31:08,899
If I hadn’t died, I would have lived in your shadow.

859
01:31:12,466 --> 01:31:13,565
And now

860
01:31:13,566 --> 01:31:16,165
You will spend the rest of your days in mine.

861
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,532
The only advantage in the death of the father ...

862
01:31:23,866 --> 01:31:26,532
That I didn't see who you were.

863
01:31:26,833 --> 01:31:29,332
Real disgrace or for the Toretto family.

864
01:31:32,233 --> 01:31:35,365
Do you think you met Dad? No ^ you didn't know, you lick ass!

865
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:37,765
Sure?


866
01:31:38,433 --> 01:31:39,765
Do you want to know the truth?


867
01:31:43,333 --> 01:31:45,732
He died because he wanted to play.

868
01:31:46,533 --> 01:31:48,365
The family is in debt.

869
01:31:48,666 --> 01:31:50,665
Not to disappoint

870
01:31:51,933 --> 01:31:55,632
He addressed me.
How did I know the car would explode?

871
01:31:57,366 --> 01:31:59,265
A good boy would have convinced him.

872
01:32:00,733 --> 01:32:03,132
And a good brother would have told you.

873
01:32:03,133 --> 01:32:04,165
Are you sure?

874
01:32:09,566 --> 01:32:12,165
He took my word not to say it.

875
01:32:13,433 --> 01:32:15,199
And I did it!

876
01:32:17,033 --> 01:32:18,765
Now you know the truth.

877
01:32:25,966 --> 01:32:27,499
I'll take the key.

878
01:32:27,866 --> 01:32:28,932
Jakob!

879
01:32:32,066 --> 01:32:33,632
I'll stop you.

880
01:32:34,633 --> 01:32:36,265
Big brother word.

881
01:32:40,333 --> 01:32:41,232
No!

882
01:32:46,466 --> 01:32:48,499
Now, leave now.

883
01:32:49,100 --> 01:32:50,565
Come on. Fast.

884
01:32:54,333 --> 01:32:56,699
- Brother, how are you?
- Get up.

885
01:33:13,166 --> 01:33:13,699
.

886
01:33:18,900 --> 01:33:19,765
Get off!

887
01:33:30,433 --> 01:33:33,099
Come on, fast! Fast!


888
01:33:42,766 --> 01:33:43,699
Because here!

889
01:33:49,166 --> 01:33:50,499
Come out fast!

890
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:53,799
They didn't go too far!

891
01:33:58,066 --> 01:33:59,299
Come on!

892
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:00,865
Here!

893
01:34:04,700 --> 01:34:05,965
I'm in your heart.

894
01:34:06,500 --> 01:34:07,565
Forever

895
01:34:10,266 --> 01:34:12,665
No no!

896
01:35:49,433 --> 01:35:50,365
Boy

897
01:35:51,233 --> 01:35:52,765
Did you notice anything?

898
01:36:00,900 --> 01:36:03,032
Such cars are immortal.

899
01:36:09,133 --> 01:36:11,565
Old chargers are so well made ...

900
01:36:11,566 --> 01:36:15,632
That with proper care they can work forever.

901
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:17,665
What, forever?

902
01:36:20,766 --> 01:36:22,699
The same goes for the family.

903
01:36:23,466 --> 01:36:26,099
A good family does not die.

904
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:29,499
Create such a family.

905
01:36:29,733 --> 01:36:30,799
Apu!

906
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:41,065
Kis Brian.


907
01:36:41,366 --> 01:36:43,199
When are you coming home?

908
01:36:43,500 --> 01:36:44,465
Soon

909
01:37:02,966 --> 01:37:06,565
No, I pay on time.
I give you my word of honor!

910
01:37:49,166 --> 01:37:51,065
I already have problems within 2 laps!


911
01:37:51,066 --> 01:37:52,932
I'll see, bring the cables!

912
01:37:55,300 --> 01:37:57,432
- Jakob!
- Now.

913
01:38:23,300 --> 01:38:24,299
Ready.

914
01:38:42,033 --> 01:38:43,299
iNoooo!

915
01:39:29,266 --> 01:39:30,632
You saved me

916
01:39:31,966 --> 01:39:35,765
Without you, the meaning of my whole life will disappear.

917
01:39:36,566 --> 01:39:37,965
Did you understand?

918
01:39:40,966 --> 01:39:42,499
We are the same.

919
01:39:54,700 --> 01:39:57,899
We have little time, Jakob already has all the elements.

920
01:39:57,900 --> 01:40:00,999
Once activated, just spread the signal on the planet.

921
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,365
And it doesn't stop. Absolutely.


922
01:40:03,566 --> 01:40:07,532
You must launch a pirated satellite to amplify the signal.

923
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:10,465
Broadcast of all satellites in orbit.

924
01:40:10,466 --> 01:40:12,899
We found it, thwarted his plans, saved Elle.


925
01:40:12,933 --> 01:40:18,632
We have a 0 chance here, Han. The satellites are easy to track, but we don’t have time to do it before departure.

926
01:40:18,633 --> 01:40:20,432
The point is, we have 2 goals.

927
01:40:20,766 --> 01:40:24,399
- Jacob is on the ground
- And he has an army.
- And the satellite in the sky.

928
01:40:24,400 --> 01:40:27,365
What you have to crack and need to be done manually.

929
01:40:27,366 --> 01:40:28,965
At high altitudes.

930
01:40:28,966 --> 01:40:30,832
When the satellite is in orbit.

931
01:40:31,200 --> 01:40:32,299
On the field?

932
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:35,565
We need help, otherwise there is no solution.

933
01:40:36,866 --> 01:40:38,499
We solve it ourselves.

934
01:40:39,333 --> 01:40:41,699
And we prove it many times.

935
01:40:42,200 --> 01:40:43,999
No. No ^ no, no.

936
01:40:44,566 --> 01:40:46,065
You do not understand?

937
01:40:46,766 --> 01:40:51,365
I can't see because he would be scared otherwise!


938
01:40:51,366 --> 01:40:52,765
Like all normal people!

939
01:40:52,766 --> 01:40:55,665
Track? This is a free space!

940
01:40:56,166 --> 01:40:57,599
There are strangers!

941
01:40:57,600 --> 01:41:00,465
What will we do?
How do we kidnap a transfer?

942
01:41:01,066 --> 01:41:02,965
Or are we hitting the rockets in the back?


943
01:41:04,366 --> 01:41:06,465
That is exactly what we are going to do.

944
01:41:07,266 --> 01:41:08,099
What?

945
01:41:09,933 --> 01:41:11,565
TBILISI

946
01:41:22,933 --> 01:41:25,632
This is the end
on the Pope's diplomatic relations.

947
01:41:25,633 --> 01:41:28,432
Now all the city police are running here.

948
01:41:29,300 --> 01:41:31,099
We better get out of here.

949
01:41:52,066 --> 01:41:53,199
To take away.

950
01:42:04,033 --> 01:42:05,265
It seems to work.

951
01:42:09,133 --> 01:42:12,265
As soon as the satellite is in orbit ^ begins.

952
01:42:15,166 --> 01:42:16,765
What a trap!

953
01:42:17,966 --> 01:42:18,965
What?

954
01:42:20,266 --> 01:42:23,665
Hole Only one air leak would be missing.

955
01:42:27,500 --> 01:42:30,499
Really?
With spacesuit ribbon?


956
01:42:30,500 --> 01:42:35,232
Yes. Everything here is based on the sling and duct tape, even on our clever plan.

957
01:42:35,233 --> 01:42:37,032
Dude, you don't seem to be feeling well.

958
01:42:37,033 --> 01:42:39,565
Let's go to fucking space!

959
01:42:39,566 --> 01:42:42,165
It's not like we went out in slippers for a beer!

960
01:42:42,433 --> 01:42:46,065
Act like an astronaut, or you'll all go to hell!

961
01:42:46,066 --> 01:42:50,265
- I'm going home myself.
- We'll be there in freefall.

962
01:42:50,266 --> 01:42:51,765
Are we going to fail?

963
01:42:51,766 --> 01:42:53,199
Explain it to me.

964
01:42:53,200 --> 01:42:56,032
This means that the calculations cannot lie!

965
01:42:56,033 --> 01:43:00,265
Trust the laws of physics and everything will be fine!


966
01:43:00,433 --> 01:43:02,232
This is the fifth grade of the school.


967
01:43:02,500 --> 01:43:04,665
I should have listened to the class!

968
01:43:04,866 --> 01:43:07,599
We'll start in 4 minutes, are you ready?

969
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:12,065
We still haven’t covered all the holes, the electrical tape is missing.

970
01:43:12,066 --> 01:43:13,832
Nothing, Milk.

971
01:43:13,833 --> 01:43:17,765
Guys, we can't wait any longer, he's had enough. We are both ready.

972
01:43:17,766 --> 01:43:22,599
No! The same car that exploded after the test drive.

973
01:43:22,600 --> 01:43:25,232
Are you ready! Well, I don't want to die, Milk.

974
01:43:25,233 --> 01:43:28,932
Without panic, I applied a lot of polymer ceramics to the hull.

975
01:43:29,233 --> 01:43:30,999
Now heat resistant.

976
01:43:31,966 --> 01:43:33,199
This is it.

977
01:43:33,466 --> 01:43:36,199
All 8 engines are in good condition.

978
01:43:39,566 --> 01:43:42,432
Hey, aren't you tired of the game anymore?


979
01:43:42,433 --> 01:43:44,965
The Virgin Galactic took off from 9,000 meters.

980
01:43:44,966 --> 01:43:47,265
NASA's pendulum tested 15,000.

981
01:43:47,266 --> 01:43:49,865
Given our current weight, we need to go higher.

982
01:43:49,866 --> 01:43:55,999
Much more! Without doing so, they can be immediately injured or even ignited.

983
01:43:56,133 --> 01:43:58,199
Hey, we're watching you!

984
01:43:58,200 --> 01:44:00,665
Don't worry, we're doing everything right.

985
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:02,599
Are you sure we won't burn them?

986
01:44:32,166 --> 01:44:34,665
With the help of the thermal imager, Elle is in that vehicle.


987
01:44:34,666 --> 01:44:37,832
I also found the sign "Ares". He's in the first armored car.


988
01:44:37,833 --> 01:44:41,065
By the time the boys arrive, we need to deactivate “Ares”.

989
01:44:41,066 --> 01:44:43,499
Ramsey, come on.

990
01:44:46,533 --> 01:44:48,332
The satellite is already in low orbit.

991
01:44:50,933 --> 01:44:51,865
We started.

992
01:44:52,900 --> 01:44:54,665
Loading data.

993
01:45:07,800 --> 01:45:09,932
Excellent, we have passed 15,000!

994
01:45:10,166 --> 01:45:11,999
Be optimistic, guys!

995
01:45:12,366 --> 01:45:15,965
Well, how do these ancient costumes help?

996
01:45:15,966 --> 01:45:18,232
They dived with them in the first world championship!

997
01:45:18,233 --> 01:45:22,599
How whimsical you are! We are astronauts, we have to endure it all!


998
01:45:22,600 --> 01:45:27,199
Look, they’re just as good as normal spacesuits and can withstand pressure drops!


999
01:45:27,466 --> 01:45:30,465
It can blow us up like a balloon, of course, but just a little bit.

1000
01:45:30,466 --> 01:45:31,565
That's the only difference.

1001
01:45:31,566 --> 01:45:33,865
- Now! We are at the height of departure.

1002
01:45:33,866 --> 01:45:35,832
The countdown will begin soon! Ready?

1003
01:45:35,833 --> 01:45:39,865
You are crazy? I’m not even jumping into a kids ’pool in this fucking spacesuit!

1004
01:45:39,866 --> 01:45:41,232
Don't listen, we're ready!

1005
01:45:41,233 --> 01:45:42,399
- We?
-Exactly!

1006
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:44,299
Do you think he is invulnerable?

1007
01:45:44,300 --> 01:45:46,665
Let's see now!


1008
01:45:46,666 --> 01:45:48,932
- Press the button!
- No, Milk!

1009
01:45:51,966 --> 01:45:53,299
Fuck!

1010
01:45:53,300 --> 01:45:55,699
- I do not want to die!
- i Motor!

1011
01:46:40,533 --> 01:46:43,099
Fuck!

1012
01:46:47,366 --> 01:46:49,032
We are already astronauts!


1013
01:46:50,333 --> 01:46:52,399
My calculations were correct.

1014
01:46:52,766 --> 01:46:55,065
Very good person!

1015
01:47:06,466 --> 01:47:08,565
Did you eat that much chocolate?

1016
01:47:08,566 --> 01:47:11,565
Forgive me, I am attracted to stressful sweets.

1017
01:47:21,033 --> 01:47:22,665
You said you guessed it.

1018
01:47:24,500 --> 01:47:29,899
One minute Hey, kill these bastards right away!

1019
01:49:04,933 --> 01:49:07,099
Well, Han, Mia, come on!

1020
01:49:20,933 --> 01:49:21,999
■ SOUIBA

1021
01:49:27,533 --> 01:49:28,699
Letty.

1022
01:50:46,300 --> 01:50:47,865
Crazy! That's how he's going to kill us!

1023
01:50:48,166 --> 01:50:49,465
No, not all of them.

1024
01:50:57,266 --> 01:50:58,365
Now.

1025
01:51:03,900 --> 01:51:07,165
The satellite you're looking for must be somewhere ...

1026
01:51:07,300 --> 01:51:09,765
There. It's there, see?

1027
01:51:10,400 --> 01:51:13,399
I see it. Just promise to treat me.

1028
01:51:13,700 --> 01:51:16,699
My friend, did I bother you with your calculations?

1029
01:51:17,800 --> 01:51:19,565
So don’t bother driving.


1030
01:51:26,766 --> 01:51:30,465
Two guys from the ghetto are in space.

1031
01:51:32,500 --> 01:51:34,899
But, as always, no one will believe them.

1032
01:51:35,233 --> 01:51:36,199
Shame.

1033
01:51:44,966 --> 01:51:46,832
Apparently something is wrong with the antennas.

1034
01:51:46,833 --> 01:51:48,999
There is a lot of intervention.

1035
01:51:51,666 --> 01:51:52,932
I'll take care of it.

1036
01:52:11,866 --> 01:52:12,899
Han.

1037
01:52:14,200 --> 01:52:16,865
Sit behind the wheel. It starts.

1038
01:52:19,066 --> 01:52:20,765
I want to join their channel.


1039
01:52:33,700 --> 01:52:38,032
- What's going on there, Otto?
- Sorry, the download is in full swing.

1040
01:52:38,833 --> 01:52:42,565
Anyway, I have a new business partner, you know him.

1041
01:52:42,566 --> 01:52:44,665
That little mouse in the box, Jakob.

1042
01:52:46,566 --> 01:52:48,099
I already told you.

1043
01:52:51,066 --> 01:52:53,165
I don't consider him a racer.

1044
01:52:53,466 --> 01:52:55,132
Otto, listen carefully.


1045
01:52:55,133 --> 01:52:56,632
Come on, last word.

1046
01:52:56,633 --> 01:52:59,199
You're ugly, stupid fucking, and I'll kill you.

1047
01:52:59,200 --> 01:53:02,199
No one would have explained it to you ...

1048
01:53:02,633 --> 01:53:06,665
Stupid ugly fucking lord of the world.

1049
01:54:51,766 --> 01:54:52,765
■ so LUGA

1050
01:55:32,300 --> 01:55:33,565
What is there?


1051
01:55:33,600 --> 01:55:36,299
We seem to be left without courtship or guard.

1052
01:55:36,300 --> 01:55:43,299
And without Jacob. And Dominio is doing everything he can to ruin our vacation, but bullshit, don’t worry, honey.

1053
01:55:43,300 --> 01:55:44,765
I have to do everything.

1054
01:55:49,166 --> 01:55:52,099
Well, we tested the armor of this monster.

1055
01:55:52,100 --> 01:55:53,232
Are you ready

1056
01:56:06,733 --> 01:56:07,765
To the maximum.


1057
01:56:07,766 --> 01:56:10,132
If we don’t break through, at least we’ll stop them.

1058
01:56:41,233 --> 01:56:44,599
Don’t think about stopping and the download is almost complete.

1059
01:56:45,033 --> 01:56:47,665
Dominic, we have to go now, or we'll die.


1060
01:56:57,500 --> 01:57:00,599
- Letty, go back and stay with her.
-	What?

1061
01:57:00,600 --> 01:57:05,332
If we can’t slow down or pierce, we’ll turn it around and open up the gut!

1062
01:57:05,333 --> 01:57:09,665
The villains are here!
Why do I have to show you everything? Kill them!

1063
01:57:27,966 --> 01:57:31,665
- Power line!
- You read my mind! Go in front of me!

1064
01:57:33,500 --> 01:57:35,299
Dominic, I can't come in.

1065
01:57:36,833 --> 01:57:38,032
But I know.


1066
01:58:53,133 --> 01:58:57,665
Great, the satellite is close. Now put on the magnets and fry.

1067
01:58:58,166 --> 01:58:59,499
The point is calm.

1068
01:59:09,300 --> 01:59:10,832
Let's go.

1069
01:59:12,466 --> 01:59:14,165
- Milk!
- One second.


1070
01:59:14,166 --> 01:59:16,332
Come on! On the go!

1071
01:59:16,333 --> 01:59:17,632
Please!

1072
01:59:19,800 --> 01:59:22,365
Fuck! Fuck!

1073
01:59:22,366 --> 01:59:24,832
Hey! Why is there no problem?

1074
01:59:24,833 --> 01:59:27,899
During startup, the cables appear to be broken from overload.

1075
01:59:29,466 --> 01:59:31,565
You idiot! I could have foreseen it.

1076
01:59:32,433 --> 01:59:34,199
Guys, what would be there?

1077
01:59:34,600 --> 01:59:36,632
Data upload is almost complete!

1078
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:39,999
Or maybe we'll just destroy it?

1079
01:59:40,300 --> 01:59:43,165
- Destroy all the shit and that's it.
- No.

1080
01:59:43,166 --> 01:59:46,132
If we smash,
we will most likely die.

1081
01:59:46,300 --> 01:59:49,065
Even if we survive, we will use all the fuel.

1082
01:59:49,566 --> 01:59:51,299
And we will stay here forever.


1083
01:59:52,566 --> 01:59:54,165
We can be lucky ^ brother.

1084
01:59:54,166 --> 01:59:56,599
Luck cannot be calculated.

1085
01:59:56,600 --> 01:59:58,365
You know what, Milk?

1086
01:59:59,833 --> 02:00:01,265
Looks like you were right.

1087
02:00:04,200 --> 02:00:05,699
We are not superheroes.

1088
02:00:08,566 --> 02:00:11,365
We always seem to have had great luck.

1089
02:00:17,433 --> 02:00:18,865
It's over now.

1090
02:00:21,933 --> 02:00:23,232
But he knows my friend
■ ■ ■

1091
02:00:24,866 --> 02:00:26,432
If we die ...

1092
02:00:28,266 --> 02:00:30,332
We do it on top of the world.

1093
02:00:31,466 --> 02:00:35,065
Guys, why are you silent? Seconds left!

1094
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,899
Attack! It's going.

1095
02:00:45,266 --> 02:00:49,299
Five! Four! Three! Two!

1096
02:00:49,866 --> 02:00:50,965
one


1097
02:00:58,166 --> 02:00:59,732
The charge is complete.

1098
02:01:04,133 --> 02:01:06,732
Error, loss of communication.

1099
02:01:09,366 --> 02:01:10,365
We did it!

1100
02:01:11,700 --> 02:01:12,832
We did it!

1101
02:01:13,133 --> 02:01:14,265
Come on


1102
02:01:14,300 --> 02:01:15,432
Yes!

1103
02:01:15,600 --> 02:01:17,399
Wow! Fuck!

1104
02:01:17,400 --> 02:01:18,565
Not bad, man.

1105
02:01:19,166 --> 02:01:20,599
Excellent attack.

1106
02:01:32,233 --> 02:01:33,299
Be careful!

1107
02:01:42,166 --> 02:01:43,232
Be careful!

1108
02:02:00,266 --> 02:02:02,132
The connection has been established.

1109
02:02:03,833 --> 02:02:06,499
"Ares" is found, the magnet is activated.

1110
02:02:35,833 --> 02:02:37,332
Large!

1111
02:02:40,466 --> 02:02:45,065
- The connection was lost.
- How stubborn.

1112
02:03:11,400 --> 02:03:12,765
The connection has been established.

1113
02:03:21,133 --> 02:03:22,965
Damn it!

1114
02:03:32,966 --> 02:03:34,765
The connection to the drone was lost.

1115
02:04:14,266 --> 02:04:15,765
Here are yours.

1116
02:04:26,200 --> 02:04:28,732
You have crossed the road with many, they are taking revenge.

1117
02:04:28,733 --> 02:04:29,865
I know.

1118
02:04:31,300 --> 02:04:33,132
I chose this path.

1119
02:04:34,633 --> 02:04:36,632
Our father was not without sins.

1120
02:04:38,266 --> 02:04:39,932
But he loved us both.


1121
02:04:43,900 --> 02:04:46,399
I was rescued once after I got the car keys.

1122
02:04:47,933 --> 02:04:49,765
It changed my life.

1123
02:04:51,300 --> 02:04:52,932
Now I will do the same.

1124
02:05:06,500 --> 02:05:08,265
I already lost you.

1125
02:05:09,433 --> 02:05:11,365
And I don't want to lose you again.

1126
02:05:44,466 --> 02:05:47,865
Air traffic control center, do you see that too?

1127
02:05:48,600 --> 02:05:51,599
It looks like a very strange car.

1128
02:05:52,333 --> 02:05:54,099
We come in peace!

1129
02:05:54,900 --> 02:05:55,999
Hello!

1130
02:05:56,833 --> 02:05:58,865
But why do they wear a suit

1131
02:05:59,566 --> 02:06:00,765
.... one of his minions?

1132
02:06:24,800 --> 02:06:27,499
This is the last time I saw your grandfather.

1133
02:06:29,366 --> 02:06:31,032
He led this course.

1134
02:06:31,400 --> 02:06:33,299
So you led here too?

1135
02:06:33,666 --> 02:06:36,632
No, but it affected me.


1136
02:06:39,133 --> 02:06:42,632
Here I learned the most important thing in my life.

1137
02:06:42,633 --> 02:06:43,999
Right?

1138
02:06:44,800 --> 02:06:45,899
True.

1139
02:07:29,900 --> 02:07:31,599
Everything will be fine, Jakob.

1140
02:07:35,566 --> 02:07:37,465
yes, it will not be easy for us.

1141
02:07:40,300 --> 02:07:42,065
But everything will work out.

1142
02:07:44,333 --> 02:07:46,365
Because we are a family.

1143
02:08:11,233 --> 02:08:12,532
- For us.
- For us.

1144
02:08:19,833 --> 02:08:20,999
Oops!

1145
02:08:21,366 --> 02:08:22,765
Not possible!

1146
02:08:33,733 --> 02:08:35,099
- Hello.
-	Are you alive!

1147
02:08:37,866 --> 02:08:39,765
I didn't believe you survived.

1148
02:08:44,700 --> 02:08:46,132
It's a long story.

1149
02:08:47,333 --> 02:08:49,432
Let's enjoy the moment.

1150
02:08:50,466 --> 02:08:52,065
I'll introduce you to Elle.

1151
02:08:52,300 --> 02:08:54,499
Hi Elle. I'm Sean.

1152
02:08:56,700 --> 02:08:58,699
- I am glad.
-	Hello friend.

1153
02:08:58,700 --> 02:09:00,132
- What the!
-	How are you?


1154
02:09:01,933 --> 02:09:04,565
Ramsey, this is Santos. Saints, this is Ramsey.

1155
02:09:04,566 --> 02:09:06,332
Hello! I've heard a lot about you.


1156
02:09:06,600 --> 02:09:07,499
And where is Leo?

1157
02:09:07,500 --> 02:09:10,532
That’s why he opened a restaurant in Brookiyn.

1158
02:09:10,533 --> 02:09:12,565
- Seriously?
- The food sucks.

1159
02:09:12,566 --> 02:09:14,265
But hippies love it.

1160
02:09:14,433 --> 02:09:16,365
- Everyone has their own.
- Hello.

1161
02:09:16,366 --> 02:09:17,365
Hello

1162
02:09:17,866 --> 02:09:19,632
How long can I wait for my food?

1163
02:09:20,133 --> 02:09:22,432
No, seriously, I'm hungry.

1164
02:09:22,766 --> 02:09:25,199
The pipes in space make me hungry.

1165
02:09:25,200 --> 02:09:28,099
Oh yes? Are there any chocolates in the tubes?

1166
02:09:28,466 --> 02:09:29,865
The ones you ate.

1167
02:09:29,866 --> 02:09:31,399
But they saved me.


1168
02:09:31,566 --> 02:09:34,332
- Well, wasn't my hunger important?
- Are we cooking soon?

1169
02:09:34,333 --> 02:09:35,432
Okay, I'll leave you.

1170
02:09:35,433 --> 02:09:36,732
Do not fight.

1171
02:09:39,966 --> 02:09:41,832
Well, you're like Dad.

1172
02:09:42,900 --> 02:09:44,432
- Right?
- Yes.

1173
02:09:46,100 --> 02:09:48,132
You know ...


1174
02:09:48,500 --> 02:09:50,632
We met your mom and there.


1175
02:09:51,133 --> 02:09:54,432
Imagine he is looking straight at you from the sky.

SECURE RECEPTION INTERMEDIATE


1178
02:10:25,666 --> 02:10:26,799
Hello!


1179
02:10:27,066 --> 02:10:28,165
- Hello!
- Hello!


1180
02:10:28,966 --> 02:10:31,565
Little Brian is ready to thank himself.


1181
02:10:31,566 --> 02:10:32,632
Again!


1182
02:10:33,600 --> 02:10:34,865
No hurry.


1183
02:10:36,200 --> 02:10:37,799
Someone is still missing.


1184
02:10:38,500 --> 02:10:39,865
He's coming now.
