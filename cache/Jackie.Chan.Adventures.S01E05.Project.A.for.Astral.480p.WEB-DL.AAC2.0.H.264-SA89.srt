1
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:16,482
The sheep talisman?

2
00:00:16,484 --> 00:00:18,684
Oh, Jackie had
a little lamb.

3
00:00:19,886 --> 00:00:21,153
(Crash)

4
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:22,988
It's not here.

5
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:24,790
Can you believe it?

6
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:26,525
Hah.

7
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:27,926
Guess not.

8
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:45,411
(Cell phone rings)

9
00:00:45,413 --> 00:00:46,512
Hello.

10
00:00:46,514 --> 00:00:47,746
Jade: Jackie! Help!

11
00:00:47,748 --> 00:00:49,014
Jade, what's wrong?

12
00:00:49,016 --> 00:00:50,983
Never leave me
with uncle again.

13
00:00:50,985 --> 00:00:53,018
We eat nothing
but mung beans and rice.

14
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,486
And he reeks of garlic.

15
00:00:54,488 --> 00:00:56,188
And uncle's no fun.

16
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,191
I asked him if we could go
to the new Melvin moose
amusement park,

17
00:00:59,193 --> 00:01:02,594
and he's all, "roller coasters
are bad for digestion."

18
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:03,896
Ahh! No!

19
00:01:03,898 --> 00:01:05,531
I know!
Can you believe it?

20
00:01:05,533 --> 00:01:07,533
So you promise we'll go
as soon as you get home?

21
00:01:07,535 --> 00:01:08,734
Promise?

22
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:10,302
Yes! Whatever,
I promise!

23
00:01:10,304 --> 00:01:11,637
Good-bye!

24
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:17,009
Valmont, score!
(Chuckles)

25
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:19,445
And chan?

26
00:01:19,447 --> 00:01:21,313
We'll miss him
dearly.

27
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:26,518
Hohh!

28
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:31,984
Aah!

29
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:33,986
(Whimpering)

30
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:35,354
You need to jump!

31
00:02:35,356 --> 00:02:36,788
(Whimpering)

32
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,090
Aah!
- Unh!

33
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:52,871
Uhh!

34
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,308
No way he's human.

35
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,543
Ohh...

36
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:02,181
Ahh! Bad day, bad day,
bad day, bad day!

37
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:03,749
Eyaah!

38
00:03:03,751 --> 00:03:05,317
Fly! Fly! Fly!

39
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,087
Yaaaa!

40
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,326
One stop shopping.

41
00:03:14,328 --> 00:03:15,394
(Grunt)

42
00:03:15,396 --> 00:03:16,495
No!

43
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:19,565
Did I do that?

44
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:41,954
Jackie!

45
00:03:41,956 --> 00:03:43,255
Uhh! Hello Jade.

46
00:03:43,257 --> 00:03:44,423
Did you--

47
00:03:44,425 --> 00:03:45,457
I'm going
to Melvin world.

48
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:46,525
Oh, what?

49
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:47,960
Uh, oh, ok.

50
00:03:47,962 --> 00:03:50,295
But first I go home
and get some sleep.

51
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:51,463
Aw...

52
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:53,031
Jackie!

53
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:54,099
Uncle!

54
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:55,234
What did you bring me?

55
00:03:55,236 --> 00:03:57,135
The sheep talisman?

56
00:03:57,137 --> 00:03:58,270
Good!

57
00:03:58,272 --> 00:04:00,272
Now we can do research!

58
00:04:00,274 --> 00:04:03,208
Oh, but I'm very tired.

59
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,077
Oh, I'm sorry.

60
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:06,211
Wait.

61
00:04:06,213 --> 00:04:08,080
What is it?
What do you hear?

62
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:09,281
Ow!

63
00:04:09,283 --> 00:04:11,583
I hear the sound
of the sheep

64
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:14,286
not telling me
what power it holds.

65
00:04:14,288 --> 00:04:17,155
I hear the sound
of our footsteps

66
00:04:17,157 --> 00:04:18,490
walking to the back room

67
00:04:18,492 --> 00:04:21,426
to translate
ancient inscriptions.

68
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:24,663
Please, uncle, I have been
traveling for 18 hours.

69
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:27,799
I jump from a helicopter
and ran along a falling train.

70
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:32,237
That is why you must relax
with some good books.

71
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:38,710
Chan possesses yet
another talisman...

72
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:41,813
While I have none?!

73
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:44,816
You are weak, valmont!

74
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:47,486
And your men are fools!

75
00:04:47,488 --> 00:04:50,856
That's it! I ain't
taking no more lip
from a statue.

76
00:04:50,858 --> 00:04:53,925
I am no statue!

77
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:56,995
You stand in the presence
of a demon sorcerer.

78
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:04,536
I once held dominion
over a vast empire.

79
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:07,205
But my subjects betrayed me.

80
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:09,207
They cast a <i> chi</i> spell,

81
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:12,711
which imprisoned me
in this pitiful icon,

82
00:05:12,713 --> 00:05:16,381
where I have remained
for 900 years.

83
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:19,685
The 12 magic talismans
from which I drew my power

84
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:22,788
was scattered to the winds.

85
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:25,057
Whoa!

86
00:05:25,059 --> 00:05:26,758
You got jacked!

87
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,528
Acquisition
of all the talismans

88
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:32,764
will allow me to be
free of my confinement

89
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:36,401
and walk the earth
once again.

90
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:39,004
At which time
we will be rewarded

91
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:41,740
the lost treasure
of shin shi-wah.

92
00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:44,076
Well worth taking
a little lip,

93
00:05:44,078 --> 00:05:45,744
don't you think?

94
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,814
Uncle: Jackie,

95
00:05:48,816 --> 00:05:50,682
these symbols
explain

96
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,250
the talisman's
power.

97
00:05:52,252 --> 00:05:54,353
We must find
a translation.

98
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:57,222
(Snoring)

99
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:01,059
Ow! Counting sheep
makes me sleepy!

100
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:03,295
One more thing...

101
00:06:03,297 --> 00:06:06,765
We must keep the talisman
in this magic box,

102
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:09,935
where it will be concealed
from the dark forces.

103
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:18,977
One more thing...
Stay awake!

104
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:21,780
You break
many antiques
when you sleepwalk.

105
00:06:21,782 --> 00:06:23,915
Oh, I don't sleepwalk!

106
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:25,417
So! You break

107
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:28,253
my antiques
for fun?!

108
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:31,022
I'll find out what
it does the easy way.

109
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:34,359
Hmm. Just hope it
isn't the exploding
head talisman.

110
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:48,306
Work already!

111
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:53,879
Uhh!

112
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:58,049
(Gasps) Oh, no!
I'm dead!

113
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:00,218
Huh? Hmm.

114
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:02,487
I'm...Not dead?

115
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:09,094
Cool! This must
be the--ooh!

116
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:11,863
Ghost talisman!
Jackie won't believe it!

117
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:16,168
Boo! Hello!

118
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:18,036
Can't you guys see me?

119
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:21,773
No? Then I guess
you won't mind if I

120
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,875
touch your guts!
(Laughing)

121
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:26,878
Melvin world
can't touch this!

122
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:28,480
Wahoo!

123
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,050
Waste of time!

124
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:33,118
They probably
got it locked up

125
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,187
at section 13 by now,

126
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:37,522
wherever that is.

127
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:40,125
Uh, I'm sorry, did
you say something?

128
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,272
No way!
Yes way!

129
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:57,042
Ratso: So then chan
lifts a whole bus
off the ground,

130
00:07:57,044 --> 00:07:58,376
and he Chucks it
at us!

131
00:07:58,378 --> 00:08:00,479
He wasn't easy
to take down,

132
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:03,081
but we knew how much
you wanted this.

133
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:11,356
Cheers, shendu.

134
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:13,525
The first of an even dozen.

135
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,361
I am free!

136
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:20,599
The sheep talisman
enables me

137
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:22,667
to project
my astral form.

138
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:25,270
An admirable start,

139
00:08:25,272 --> 00:08:27,372
but I must have
the others.

140
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:31,176
Yeah, but finding
section 13 won't be

141
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:32,777
as easy as taking
a talisman

142
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:35,547
out of a sleeping
kid's hand--ow!

143
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:38,083
Did that occur
before or after chan

144
00:08:38,085 --> 00:08:39,818
"chucked the bus"?

145
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,121
(Hisses) This
sleeping child

146
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:45,924
may not be
sleeping at all.

147
00:08:45,926 --> 00:08:47,993
And if her
spirit wanders,

148
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:51,162
her vessel
has a vacancy!

149
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,735
Jade: Ew! Quit
picking your nose!

150
00:08:58,137 --> 00:09:00,539
(Sighs) Being a ghost
of golden gate park

151
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:03,708
is pretty lame if no one
can see you. I'm outie!

152
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,677
(Yawns) Hmm.

153
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:09,281
Jade is awfully quiet.

154
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,055
Oh! Like a baby!

155
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,124
Hmm.

156
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:25,964
(Jackie snoring)

157
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:28,266
Oh! Like a baby!

158
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,505
Ohh! Where's
the talisman?

159
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:37,576
Whoa! What are you?

160
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:40,946
Everything you will
grow to fear!

161
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:42,981
(Hissing)

162
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:48,620
(Gasps)

163
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,531
Uh! Oh, wha--

164
00:09:59,533 --> 00:10:01,933
time to awaken,
dear uncle.

165
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,468
Sorry, Charlie!
But my body

166
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,637
ain't big enough
for the both of us.

167
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:06,771
Unh!

168
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:10,675
Unh! Get out of there!

169
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:12,978
Give me back
my skin and bones!

170
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,214
Unh! Ugh!

171
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:19,217
You should not
sleep on the floor,
uncle Jackie.

172
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:21,987
(Yawns) We should
go back to section 13.

173
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:24,489
Yes! Section 13.

174
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:27,626
Uncle: Jackie!

175
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:30,528
(Sighs) Eventually.

176
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:31,663
Grr!

177
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:34,833
Jade: Jackie,
she's not me!

178
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:37,102
You gotta listen!

179
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:39,904
(Growls) Scream
all you wish, child.

180
00:10:39,906 --> 00:10:41,773
They are deaf to you!

181
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:45,977
What do you want
with my body?

182
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:48,179
What do you want
with Jackie?

183
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:51,282
Gaah!

184
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:54,152
Jackie, Jackie,
Jackie! Look out!

185
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,987
Refreshments anyone?

186
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:01,159
Orange slices
and oolong tea

187
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:03,161
for my cherished
elders?

188
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:04,329
Wonderful!

189
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:05,864
Thank you, Jade!

190
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:08,133
It's probably
poisoned! Don't!

191
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:10,969
Jackie, no!

192
00:11:10,971 --> 00:11:12,570
Mmm! Delicious!

193
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:14,939
And nutritious.

194
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:18,276
Jackie, she is
so not me!

195
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:19,344
How could you
fall for that

196
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:21,146
sweet-as-pie
routine?

197
00:11:21,148 --> 00:11:24,816
She's some kind
of evil spirit
thing!

198
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:27,819
Why would
an evil spirit
act so nice?

199
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:29,421
Please forgive
my interruption,

200
00:11:29,423 --> 00:11:32,691
but I wish to go
to section 13 now.

201
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:35,427
And why is it so
interested in going to--

202
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:38,096
(gasps) Section 13!
The other talismans!

203
00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:41,433
She--it--must be working
for the dark hand!

204
00:11:41,435 --> 00:11:43,168
(Yawns) Well,

205
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,369
Jade wants to go,

206
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:46,438
so I'll just--ow!

207
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,373
Arrange a ride
for her.

208
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:54,379
Black.

209
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:56,114
It's Jackie. Can you
send someone

210
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:58,183
to take Jade back
to section 13?

211
00:11:58,185 --> 00:12:00,251
You all right, Jackie?
You sound beat.

212
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:02,053
(Sighs)
I'll be fine.

213
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:05,123
It's just between
all this travel
and research,

214
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,459
I haven't had much
time for Jade.

215
00:12:07,461 --> 00:12:09,260
She really wants
to go to this

216
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:11,062
Melvin world and...

217
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:17,502
Your coach awaits,
little lady.

218
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:25,276
Uncle: Hotcha!

219
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:29,447
The sheep talisman
possesses the power

220
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:32,117
of astral projection.

221
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:33,551
Yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes!

222
00:12:33,553 --> 00:12:35,220
Great! Night-night!

223
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:36,621
One more thing!

224
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:39,357
Astral bodies
can pass
through walls,

225
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:41,359
but they
cannot be seen

226
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:43,795
duh.
- Or heard...

227
00:12:43,797 --> 00:12:46,364
Unless they enter
a person's dreams.

228
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:51,803
Dreams?! Score!

229
00:12:51,805 --> 00:12:53,138
(Snoring)

230
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:54,906
Aah!

231
00:12:54,908 --> 00:12:56,441
One more thing...

232
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:58,710
You forget
to sweep the store!

233
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:02,080
(Both sigh)

234
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,520
Come on, come on!
Sweep faster, Jackie!

235
00:13:08,522 --> 00:13:09,854
(Snoring)

236
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:11,356
Yes!

237
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:18,663
Jackie!
Can you see me?

238
00:13:18,665 --> 00:13:20,398
Can't talk, Jade.
Sweeping.

239
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,966
Uncle: Jackie!

240
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,210
Jackie,
listen to me!

241
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:33,344
You're dreaming!

242
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:35,680
Not now. Gotta
sweep the train.

243
00:13:35,682 --> 00:13:37,115
Oh! Oh, no!

244
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:43,454
What happened?

245
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:46,224
Hey,
stand still!

246
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:52,096
You're dreaming
<i>and</i> you're sleepwalking!

247
00:13:52,098 --> 00:13:53,965
Oh! I don't
sleepwalk.

248
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:03,174
(Gasps)

249
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:08,413
Stop!

250
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:12,050
(Snoring)

251
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:17,889
Uncle Jackie,
you're dreaming!

252
00:14:17,891 --> 00:14:19,390
But I'm real!

253
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:21,593
I took the talisman
and I got all ghosty,

254
00:14:21,595 --> 00:14:23,995
but when I got
back to my body...

255
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,068
And so now
the bad guys
have the talisman,

256
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,403
and evil me is going
to section 13

257
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:33,738
to steal
the rest of them.

258
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,140
And you've
gotta stop me!

259
00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:38,142
I mean, the me
outside this dream.

260
00:14:38,144 --> 00:14:40,545
Dream? Oh, that's
crazy, Jade.

261
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:41,746
You're crazy!

262
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:43,081
If I'm the crazy one,

263
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,450
how come you're the one
not wearing pants?

264
00:14:45,452 --> 00:14:46,584
Huh?

265
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:58,496
I can prove everything,
Jackie.

266
00:14:58,498 --> 00:15:01,099
Look in the box.
The talisman's gone!

267
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:02,567
Now wake up!

268
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:05,136
Aah!

269
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:06,804
Ugh!

270
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:14,679
(Gasps)

271
00:15:14,681 --> 00:15:16,347
My dream was no dream!

272
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:17,682
Jade is right.

273
00:15:17,684 --> 00:15:19,884
I'm the bomb,
uh-huh. Uh-huh.

274
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:23,021
Where is
the talisman?

275
00:15:23,023 --> 00:15:24,956
Jade has it.
Uh, had it.

276
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,591
Uncle, this will
sound crazy--

277
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:30,528
Jade took the talisman,
and now she's trapped
in astral form

278
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:33,231
while an evil spirit
walks in her body.

279
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:35,867
Uh...Yes!

280
00:15:35,869 --> 00:15:38,970
The sheep talisman
put on wolf in sheep's
clothing.

281
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:42,607
You find Jade.
- I will find a <i> chi</i> spell
to banish the wolf.

282
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:44,776
Go, uncle.

283
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:46,544
Almost there, Jade.

284
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:49,047
I know it may seem
silly by now,

285
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:50,882
but I have to ask you
to wear this.

286
00:15:50,884 --> 00:15:53,785
At last, section 13.

287
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:02,927
Ok, you can look.

288
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:08,199
(Melvin moose laughing)

289
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:11,669
A little birdie told me
you've been wanting
to come here.

290
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:12,837
Grrr!

291
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:15,740
Black.

292
00:16:15,742 --> 00:16:17,241
Captain black.
Trust me.

293
00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:18,676
You're in terrible danger.

294
00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:20,545
Jade is evil!

295
00:16:20,547 --> 00:16:22,613
I know she's
a handful, Jackie.

296
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:23,948
But evil?

297
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,251
Whee! Hee, ha ha!
Whee!

298
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:31,789
Duh...Smile
for the camera.

299
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,691
Soon I shall devour
your soul.

300
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:34,926
(Gasp)

301
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:40,631
P.A.: Melvin's world
is now closed!

302
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:41,866
Please exit the park
and see us again soon!

303
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:43,001
Finally!
Aw...

304
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:44,168
What do you say,

305
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,870
stop off for an
ice cream cone?

306
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:47,772
Captain black,
get away from her!

307
00:16:47,774 --> 00:16:49,073
Whoa there, Jackie.

308
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:50,208
Grrr!

309
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,843
She's not really Jade!

310
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:54,512
The talisman's magic
has made her a sheep.

311
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,114
Oh, no, I mean, uh...

312
00:16:56,116 --> 00:16:57,682
I'll prove it!

313
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:01,519
What's the moose's name?

314
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:02,720
The name?

315
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:04,389
Grrr!

316
00:17:04,391 --> 00:17:07,058
Give you a hint.
Another word
for wedgie.

317
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,826
You can't name it,
can you?

318
00:17:08,828 --> 00:17:11,396
You're evil!
You're evil!

319
00:17:11,398 --> 00:17:14,966
Jackie, you look like you
could use a little sleep.

320
00:17:14,968 --> 00:17:16,367
Uhh!
- Uhh...

321
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:19,537
Oh! Who are you?

322
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,239
Your executioner.

323
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:24,042
(Grunting)

324
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:25,309
Hey.

325
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:27,045
Stop that or I--

326
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:28,946
I give you
a spanking.

327
00:17:28,948 --> 00:17:30,648
As you wish!

328
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,483
This is not my body!

329
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:38,322
Weak little girl.

330
00:17:38,324 --> 00:17:39,791
I am not weak!

331
00:17:39,793 --> 00:17:40,925
Uhh!

332
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:06,284
Come here, you!

333
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:34,378
What are you--

334
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,780
hey! Stop!

335
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:46,424
You are so not
fighting fair!

336
00:18:57,936 --> 00:18:59,070
(Ring)
Huh?

337
00:18:59,072 --> 00:19:00,404
Busy!

338
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:02,373
Uncle: Jackie,
I found the <i> chi</i> spell.

339
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:03,474
Very good one.

340
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,543
Please put Jade on phone.

341
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,049
Aaaa-uhh!

342
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:13,184
It's for you.

343
00:19:13,186 --> 00:19:15,219
Hello!
(Speaking Chinese)

344
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:19,323
(Chanting in Chinese)

345
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:24,462
(Grunts)

346
00:19:24,464 --> 00:19:25,696
Noooo!

347
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:33,538
I cannot break free!

348
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:36,941
Blasted <i> chi</i> spell.

349
00:19:36,943 --> 00:19:40,077
Shendu, back so soon?

350
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:42,046
And what, no talismans?

351
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:45,383
Jade! Jade!

352
00:19:45,385 --> 00:19:46,984
Coming, Jackie!

353
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:50,688
I'm back!

354
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,590
Jade...

355
00:19:52,592 --> 00:19:55,459
It looks like we
have lost a talisman
to the dark hand.

356
00:19:55,461 --> 00:19:56,961
Because of me.

357
00:19:56,963 --> 00:19:58,963
I know.

358
00:19:58,965 --> 00:20:01,299
But I guess
it's because of you

359
00:20:01,301 --> 00:20:04,268
that the rest
are still safe
in section 13.

360
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,270
Cool! So can we
ride again?

361
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:14,946
Hey, Jackie.
- Yes.

362
00:20:14,948 --> 00:20:16,881
Who do you admire
and why?

363
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:19,317
Oh, so many people
I admire.

364
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:21,652
Steven Spielberg,
George, Lucas,

365
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:22,820
the people of talent.

366
00:20:22,822 --> 00:20:26,123
They can use the computer,
special effects,

367
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:29,093
not follow the tradition
like me, you know,
hurt myself,

368
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:31,095
jumping off of real car.

369
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:35,800
They can use the fake people,
and they can use
a--a dinosaur.

370
00:20:35,802 --> 00:20:37,268
Just choose part,
doo doo doo.

371
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,537
When I look at those kind
of people, they really...

372
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:42,406
That--those kind of people
I really admire. Wow!
