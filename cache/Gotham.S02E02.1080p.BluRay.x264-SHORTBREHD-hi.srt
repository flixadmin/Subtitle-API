Soon, very soon.

Why don't you tell me about James Gordon?

It's hard to believe.

168
00:08:44,275 --> 00:08:45,568
My father's been sneaking
down here for years,

169
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:47,486
and I never even knew about it.

170
00:08:48,613 --> 00:08:50,364
That makes two of us, doesn't it?

Wait. Let's just think about this.

that bloody thing on?

Of course I'm certain.

father's research into Wayne Enterprises.

All this time, I've been looking
for a smoking gun, and here it is.

Now, guns are for grown-ups, aren't they?

One last thought from your Uncle Harvey.

These Maniax killed a bunch of people
from the shipyard, right?

Yellen Shipyard, yeah.

00:15:03,028 --> 00:15:05,614
Why there? They could've gone
anywhere, killed anyone.

But these lunatics specifically chose
that shipyard. I wonder why.

Turns out the Maniax stole a refueling

Why wasn't it reported?

It was one of
over a hundred service vehicles.

288

the entire fleet.

But not anymore?

Not me.

308

you and your family, sir.

So I tucked him up.

480
00:29:13,253 --> 00:29:14,587
Like a kipper.

481
00:29:16,297 --> 00:29:17,298
What is a kipper?

482
00:29:19,634 --> 00:29:21,386
It's a type of smoked fish.

Very nice with eggs
and brown toast for breakfast.

I cannot disagree.

489

Which kind are you?

490
00:29:46,786 --> 00:29:49,747
Both kinds of people would
give you the same answer, wouldn't they?

491
00:29:49,998 --> 00:29:53,084
Exactly. Exactly right.

492
00:29:53,585 --> 00:29:59,132
There lieth the problem, Lucius.
You see, I need to confide in you.

493
00:30:01,551 --> 00:30:03,803
But I need to know
that you're trustworthy.

494
00:30:04,387 --> 00:30:08,892
Perhaps I should decline your confidence.
I don't like the sound of these kippers.

495
00:30:09,058 --> 00:30:11,978
Yeah, well,
it's a bit late for that, unfortunately.

496
00:30:12,145 --> 00:30:14,564
I mean, it's you after all,
Lucius, that created this mess

497
00:30:14,731 --> 00:30:19,819
when you told young Master Bruce
that his dear old dead dad was a stoic.

- Do you?

502
