Perhaps it was
too much to hope for.

164
00:08:08,114 --> 00:08:09,824
Is there some way
you can get it to work?

165
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:11,971
[Lex] It was a longshot
to begin with.

166

[energy whooshing]

167
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:16,037

00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,918
- Barry!
- Ugh!

171
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:23,295
Where am I?
Where am I?

172
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:25,171
The Vanishing Point.

173
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:26,382
You've been gone
for months.

174
00:08:26,549 --> 00:08:28,151
[panting] What are you... what
are you talking about?

175
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:29,593
I just left
two seconds ago.

176
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:31,344
To go where?

177
00:08:31,387 --> 00:08:33,264
To the speed force.
I didn't...

178
00:08:33,848 --> 00:08:36,392
I couldn't... it was like...

179
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,019
[panting]

180
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:40,025
it was like running
into a mountain at mach 10.

181
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:41,187
I couldn't...

182
00:08:41,981 --> 00:08:44,358
[dramatic music]

183
00:08:44,859 --> 00:08:46,068
there's no way
out of here.

184

What did you see?

190
00:09:21,604 --> 00:09:22,604
[deep voice]
Everything.

191
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:26,233
I see everything now.

192
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:28,568
Then you're ready.

193
00:09:28,903 --> 00:09:30,821
Why would you make me
relive all that?

194
00:09:31,697 --> 00:09:34,742
Every fight, every punch
you've thrown,

195
00:09:34,909 --> 00:09:36,285
every kick
you've landed,

196
00:09:36,452 --> 00:09:38,621
every arrow you've fired,
they have all led you here

197
00:09:38,788 --> 00:09:41,665
to this moment,
to the ultimate fight.

198
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:43,666
Who am I fighting?

199
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:44,959
Not who.

200
00:09:46,045 --> 00:09:47,045
What.

201
00:09:48,047 --> 00:09:49,131
The Anti-Monitor.

202
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:52,051
[tense music]

203
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:54,237
[Oliver in deep voice]
The Monitor's adversary.

204
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:55,429
[Corrigan]
Not just adversary.

205
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:59,266
A being who stands against all there
ever was or will be,

206
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:02,645
the apocalypse itself
given life and form

207
00:10:02,895 --> 00:10:04,105
and terrible purpose.

208
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:05,564
How do I beat him?

209
00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:06,731
With help.

210
00:10:08,109 --> 00:10:09,485
It's time to get your friends.

211
00:10:10,778 --> 00:10:12,696
Barry, wait.
You look spent. You need to rest.

212
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,990
No. I'm fine.
I have to try again.

213
00:10:15,366 --> 00:10:17,046
[Sara] Hey, Barry,
that's a bad idea, okay?

214
00:10:17,201 --> 00:10:18,386
The effort alone
could kill you.

215
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,829
It's better than just
staying here.

216
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:21,264
We're not gonna let
you kill yourself.

217
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:22,288
Get out of my way!

218
00:10:22,748 --> 00:10:24,059
- [J'onn] Barry!
- [Sara] We're not letting you

219
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,084
go anywhere.

220
00:10:25,251 --> 00:10:27,878
- So try and stop me!
- In the condition you're in, Barry,

221
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:29,922
- it's not gonna be that hard.
- Cut it out!

222
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:33,422
Whatever's going to happen is not
going to include us turning on each other.

223
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:37,096
[Kara] M-maybe you're right.
Maybe the speed force

224
00:10:37,263 --> 00:10:38,806
is our last, best hope.

225
00:10:38,973 --> 00:10:40,093
[Oliver in deep voice]
It is.

226
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:43,811
The speed force is
the key to saving you.

227
00:10:43,978 --> 00:10:46,856
[dramatic music]

228
00:10:47,523 --> 00:10:49,275
It's the key to
saving everyone.

229
00:10:59,577 --> 00:11:00,703
Oliver?

230
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:03,497
Yes and no.

231
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:06,292
It's complicated.

232
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,877
Nice outfit. [chuckles]

233
00:11:09,378 --> 00:11:10,546
Very... Sith.

234
00:11:10,796 --> 00:11:12,715
[tense music]

235
00:11:12,882 --> 00:11:13,924
[whispering]
Oliver?

236
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:15,843
I am Oliver Queen,

237
00:11:16,635 --> 00:11:18,137
but I'm also
something more.

238
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:20,430
More what?

239
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:22,016
Some might call me a ghost,

240
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:24,059
a Spectre...

241
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:27,188
that's in tune with the entire
multiverse.

242
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:28,748
So there's still
a multiverse out there?

243
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:30,024
No. It's gone,

244
00:11:31,192 --> 00:11:32,776
replaced with
its antithesis.

245
00:11:33,194 --> 00:11:34,403
An anti-matter
universe.

246
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,238
Which we need to prevent
from happening.

247
00:11:37,114 --> 00:11:38,449
Right now,
the Anti-Monitor

248
00:11:38,616 --> 00:11:39,867
is at the dawn
of time,

249
00:11:40,826 --> 00:11:43,746
fighting to make permanent
his destruction of worlds.

250
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:47,166
Then we go there,
and we end him.

251
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,043
[Oliver] He's
extremely powerful.

252
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:51,128
The eight of us might
not be enough.

253
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:53,881
We need
a backup plan.

254
00:11:54,048 --> 00:11:55,424
You have our attention.

255
00:11:55,591 --> 00:11:58,469
Several millennia ago
on a planet named Maltus,

256
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:01,722
Mar Novu attempted to travel
to the birth of the universe

257
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:05,809
but instead... opened a breach
to the anti-matter universe.

258
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:08,687
[Lex] So the Monitor
gave us the Anti-Monitor.

259
00:12:08,854 --> 00:12:10,773
[Oliver] Correct.
So while some of us

260
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,524
fight at the dawn
of time,

261
00:12:13,484 --> 00:12:14,777
others must go
to Maltus.

262
00:12:15,027 --> 00:12:16,987
And prevent Novu from
freeing his doppelganger?

263
00:12:17,363 --> 00:12:18,321
I'm in.

264
00:12:18,322 --> 00:12:20,242
Travel to an alien world?
So in.

265
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:21,407
Same.

266
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:23,827
Come on. You know you
don't want to risk

267
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:26,038
letting me out of your
sight for even a millisecond.

268
00:12:26,789 --> 00:12:28,350
[Barry] We can get to both
through the speed force,

269
00:12:28,374 --> 00:12:30,292
but I can't get
into the speed force right now.

270
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,420
It's probably because
there's no multiverse left,

271
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:37,067
but you said you're in tune
with the multiverse.

272
00:12:37,091 --> 00:12:38,509
Does that include
the speed force?

273
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:40,844
What you're asking me
is very dangerous, Barry.

274
00:12:41,095 --> 00:12:42,096
But possible.

275
00:12:43,222 --> 00:12:45,307
You could give me
the energy boost I need.

276
00:12:46,058 --> 00:12:47,058
Please.

277
00:12:47,977 --> 00:12:50,938
We have to do this.
Everyone's lives depend on it.

278
00:12:51,313 --> 00:12:54,942
[dramatic music]

279
00:13:01,991 --> 00:13:03,742
I've unlocked
your potential, Barry.

280
00:13:04,827 --> 00:13:06,036
By touching my head?

281
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:08,038
Use this power
with caution.

282
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:11,916
Do you trust me?

283
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,628
Are you Oliver Queen?

284
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:17,213
Yes.

285
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:21,260
Then I trust you
with every cell of my body.

286
00:13:22,678 --> 00:13:26,348
Good. Now run, Barry.

287
00:13:28,976 --> 00:13:29,810
Run.

288
00:13:29,811 --> 00:13:33,439

Okay.

293
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:53,834
Thanks for the kind
assist.

294
00:13:54,043 --> 00:13:56,670
Why doesn't this
alien forest look more alien?

295
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:59,840
Let's focus. Mar Novu
could be anywhere,

296
00:14:00,174 --> 00:14:02,801
and it's not like we can
just do an internet search for him.

297
00:14:03,052 --> 00:14:04,172
Well, actually,
maybe we can.

298
00:14:05,554 --> 00:14:06,554
Look at that.

299
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:09,892
Any city that large
has to be a bureaucracy.

300

[dramatic music]

301
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,560
And?

302
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,105
Well, bureaucracies
require some form

303
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:16,565
of central data bank
to function.

304
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:20,986
We find that,
we find Novu.

305
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:24,365
That's actually not
a bad idea. Lex...

306

Where's Lex?

You're in

You're not...

00:15:18,669 --> 00:15:20,879
[in normal voice]
Right. The Anti-Monitor attacked.

324
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,382
We were separated,
and I am utilizing

325
00:15:23,549 --> 00:15:26,927
various pieces
of my essence

326
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:31,598
to keep me, Sara,
J'onn, and Kate together.

327
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:34,017
That's why I'm here.
This is...

328
00:15:34,977 --> 00:15:36,270
this is where we
first met.

329
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:39,982
There are few things
more powerful in the universe

330
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:42,025
than memory
and connection.

331
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:46,113
I am using our memories
of our friends

332
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,573
and closest allies

333
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:50,576
to keep all of us from falling out
of the speed force.

334
00:15:51,076 --> 00:15:52,536
Wait. What happens
if they fall out?

335
00:15:52,703 --> 00:15:54,371
We'll be consumed
by anti-matter.

336
00:15:55,497 --> 00:15:57,458
I can buy you time, Barry,

337
00:15:57,624 --> 00:16:01,503
but... you need to get
to each of us.

338
00:16:01,712 --> 00:16:03,297
I mean, the speed force
is infinite.

339
00:16:03,464 --> 00:16:05,066
I-I could never know
where to begin to look.

340
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:07,259
Remember, Barry,
memories and connections.

341
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:09,970
You need to consider
our greatest victories,

342
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:12,389
our most crushing defeats,

343
00:16:13,307 --> 00:16:16,477
the moments when the bonds
between us were forged.

344
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:18,395
When the bonds were forged.

345
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:21,148
Now do this, Barry.

346
00:16:24,026 --> 00:16:25,402
[deep voice]
Because you have to.

347
00:16:27,571 --> 00:16:30,240
[dramatic music]

348
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:32,659
[energy whooshing]

349
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:33,952
[gasps]
What the...?

350
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:35,996
[Man] Um, hello?

351
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:37,163
[gasps]

352
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,082
[exhales]

353
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,376
What the hell is this?

354
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:47,049
I'm asking myself
the same question... literally.

355
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:48,699
No. This... this
can't be happening.

356
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:50,719
This... you... what are
you doing here?

357
00:16:51,136 --> 00:16:53,639
Well, I'll tell you that
when you tell me

358
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:57,726
where... here... is.

359
00:16:58,644 --> 00:17:00,979
Is this cosplay?
Oh, do you want a selfie, bro?

360
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:03,065
- I'm sorry.
- No, no. We're not... no.

361
00:17:03,232 --> 00:17:06,401
I'm also the Flash.

362
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:07,568
You're also the what?

363
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:11,406
- The Flash?
- The Flash?

364
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:16,578
- The Flash.
- It's complicated.

365
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:21,041
- I like your outfit. It seems... comfy.
- I was thinking yours is pretty cool.

366
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:22,709
- Smooth.
- Seems safe and...

367
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:23,876
it's breathable.

368
00:17:26,797 --> 00:17:27,797
[Both] I'm Barry Allen.

369
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:29,550
- No!
- What?

370
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:31,426
What does that mean?
How can this...

371
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:33,011
This should be
impossible now.

372
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:34,178
Should be impossible now?

373
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:36,765
You don't know
about the...

374
00:17:36,932 --> 00:17:37,951
Oh, my God.
Don't do this to me.

375
00:17:37,975 --> 00:17:39,055
I don't know
about the what?

376
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:41,783
- Are you okay?
- [whispering] Oh, my God.

377
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:45,607
[echoing]
I told Victor this was possible.

378
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:47,669
[whispering]
What does this mean?

379
00:17:47,693 --> 00:17:50,737
[dramatic music]

380
00:17:52,197 --> 00:17:54,449
[Lex whistling]

381
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:57,077
[wind whooshing]

382
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:00,765
What do you think
you're doing?

383
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:02,058
What you should
have done the moment

384
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:03,362
Fleet Feet dropped us
off here...

385
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:05,252
checked out the lay
of the land,

386
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:07,004
looked for
hidden dangers.

387
00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:08,714
[Lex]
We are on an alien world.

388
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,400
Any number of chest busters
or predators could be lying in wait.

389
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,926
Don't you capes ever
watch a movie?

390
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:14,893
You know what?
Whatever it is you're planning,

391
00:18:15,012 --> 00:18:16,555
I'm gonna figure
it out, and...

392
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,432
I'm gonna stop you.

393
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:20,349
I doubt that.

394
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,061
In a contest of mind over muscle,
mind wins every time,

395
00:18:23,687 --> 00:18:24,730
but here.

396
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:27,125
Let me make it
easy for you.

397
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:28,525
[tense music]

398
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:30,360
Ask me what I'm
up to.

399
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,527
[scoffs]

400
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:33,195
Go ahead.

401
00:18:34,865 --> 00:18:37,576
All right.
What are you up to, Lex?

402
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,661
Universal domination,
of course.

403
00:18:40,245 --> 00:18:42,122
[energy whooshing]

404
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:44,291
[dramatic music]

405
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:47,127
Oh, I probably
should have mentioned

406
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:48,670
that I gave myself
a few upgrades

407
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:51,089
when I checked
The Book of Destiny out of the library.

408
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:52,341
[rustling]

409
00:18:52,507 --> 00:18:53,507
What are you
doing?

410
00:18:53,634 --> 00:18:55,111
God, I am so tired
of answering that question.

411
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:56,178
[energy whooshing]

412
00:18:56,345 --> 00:18:59,765
[dramatic music]

413
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:03,059
Moving on.

414
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,729
[whistling]

415
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:18,200
[voices echoing]

416
00:19:18,367 --> 00:19:20,160
[Ray] <i>Yeah.
The Black Canary.</i>

417
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:23,205
<i>She tried to shut me up,
but it's not gonna work.</i>

418
00:19:23,372 --> 00:19:24,831
[Oliver] I didn't
kill those people.

419
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:27,042
[Ray] Yes, I know.
Felicity told me.

420
00:19:27,209 --> 00:19:28,960
An impersonator, right?
[chuckles]

421
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:30,212
Hate when that happens.

422
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:33,548
Five years on
a deserted island.

423
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:36,760
[sighs] That kind of thing
really changes you, doesn't it?

424
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:39,805
Must have been difficult
if not impossible

425
00:19:39,971 --> 00:19:42,140
to hold on to your sanity
all those years,

426
00:19:43,225 --> 00:19:44,225
and here you are,

427
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:47,604
pretending you have
everything in control.

428
00:19:47,771 --> 00:19:49,940
[tense music]

429
00:19:50,107 --> 00:19:51,942
Felicity told you
the truth,

430
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:54,820
and you should trust
her judgment.

431
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:56,904
[Ray]
How can I do that?

432
00:19:57,864 --> 00:19:59,574
Her perception of you
is clearly clouded

433
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:01,868
by her emotional
attachment.

434
00:20:02,703 --> 00:20:05,372
She's not seeing you
for what you really are.

435
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:11,712
[Oliver] You have no idea
what this city is up against.

436
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:13,630
Actually, I think I do,

437
00:20:14,464 --> 00:20:15,841
and I'm gonna
stop him.

438
00:20:18,427 --> 00:20:19,427
Who are you?

439
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:22,346
[swallows]

440
00:20:23,557 --> 00:20:24,557
[shrieking]

441
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:26,160
[Oliver, echoing] I want to limit
your involvement in this.

442
00:20:26,184 --> 00:20:28,311
[Kara, echoing]
Why? Because I'm an alien?

443
00:20:28,603 --> 00:20:30,397
I also happen to be
your biggest weapon.

444
00:20:30,564 --> 00:20:32,607
You're an unknown quantity,
and this isn't personal.

445
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:34,484
Except that's exactly
how this feels.

446
00:20:34,735 --> 00:20:37,404
When I... when I started
living this life,

447
00:20:37,571 --> 00:20:39,614
I was going up
against human threats alone,

448
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:40,781
and I could handle that.

449
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:41,907
Then there were metahumans,

450
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:42,909
and I could
handle that.

451
00:20:43,452 --> 00:20:45,346
I just discovered that
there are multiple Earths,

452
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:47,539
and I was brainwashed
aboard an alien spacecraft.

453
00:20:47,706 --> 00:20:48,874
I'm sure that
was unnerving.

454
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,376
I don't get unnerved.
When I go up against something new,

455
00:20:51,543 --> 00:20:52,543
I push back.

456
00:20:52,753 --> 00:20:54,588
Right or wrong,
it's who I am,

457
00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:56,715
and it's what I do,
so I am asking you

458
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:58,258
for just a little
bit of space

459
00:20:58,425 --> 00:21:01,386
so that I can draw
a line somewhere,

460
00:21:02,053 --> 00:21:05,474
so that I can claw back
just a small sense of normalcy.

461
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,185
[J'onn, echoing]
I'm afraid we're well past normal.

462
00:21:09,895 --> 00:21:10,895
[energy whooshing]

463
00:21:11,021 --> 00:21:12,773
[echoing]
J'onn, what are you doing here?

464
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:16,610
[echoing]
That... is a very long story.

465
00:21:16,818 --> 00:21:19,780
[dramatic music]

466
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:24,701
[wind rustling]

467
00:21:27,871 --> 00:21:28,871
Supergirl?!

468
00:21:30,081 --> 00:21:32,334
Supergirl, please
wake up.

469
00:21:32,501 --> 00:21:33,627
[gasps]

470
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:34,920
- Hey.
- Ryan?

471
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:38,799
Yeah. I think Lex
pulled a Luthor on us.

472
00:21:40,592 --> 00:21:41,593
On the bright side,

473
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:44,238
I've never been knocked unconscious
on an alien planet before.

474
00:21:44,262 --> 00:21:46,782
It's pretty much the same as
being knocked unconscious on Earth.

475
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:48,350
[energy whooshing]

476
00:21:48,351 --> 00:21:50,519
No broken bones.
You'll be fine.

477
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:54,815
[Ryan] Thanks. This definitely
makes me question again why I'm here.

478
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:57,984
I haven't got
special powers

479
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:00,111
or, you know, powers.

480
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:02,730
I'm pretty much
the dictionary definition of unspecial,

481
00:22:02,823 --> 00:22:06,284
and I definitely don't feel like
I'm a Paragon of anything,

482
00:22:06,451 --> 00:22:07,744
let alone Humanity.

483
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,120
Hey... wait.

484
00:22:11,915 --> 00:22:13,667
Are you sure you guys
got the right guy?

485
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:16,837
You left your family
because someone

486
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:19,089
you never even met told you
you were needed.

487
00:22:19,673 --> 00:22:21,153
I'd say that makes you
pretty special.

488
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,300
[sighs]

489
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:25,511
I don't know
about hope,

490
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:28,557
but you're definitely
the Paragon of Pep Talks.

491
00:22:28,723 --> 00:22:31,560
Years of practice.
We need to catch up to Lex.

492
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:33,871
How do you know
where he's headed?

493
00:22:33,895 --> 00:22:35,188
Well, before he
knocked me out,

494
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:37,816
he said was looking for
universal domination, so...

495
00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:39,818
Hardly sounds like
a newsflash.

496
00:22:39,985 --> 00:22:42,529
The universal part is new,
but if I know him,

497
00:22:42,696 --> 00:22:45,240
he's looking to mess with
Novu's experiment,

498
00:22:45,407 --> 00:22:47,576
change history to his advantage.

499
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:51,121
He really is a selfish asshat,
isn't he?

500
00:22:51,288 --> 00:22:52,622
You really have
no idea.

501
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
What are you doing?

502
00:22:56,376 --> 00:22:59,004
I'm guessing you haven't
flown on an alien planet either.

503
00:22:59,588 --> 00:23:02,507
- I've never flown.
- No, but it's okay, Dr. Choi.

504
00:23:02,674 --> 00:23:03,693
You don't have
to be nervous.

505
00:23:03,717 --> 00:23:06,845
It's just up, up,
and away.

It's over, Deegan!

509
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:14,311
No. I decide
when the story ends!

[energy crackling]

511
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:17,355
Come on, Oliver.
Where are you?

I wasn't here for this.

[Lois screams]

519
00:23:44,841 --> 00:23:45,926
Told you you'd
catch me.

00:23:50,639 --> 00:23:51,640
Thanks for the save.

522
00:23:51,973 --> 00:23:53,433
With a magic arrow,
no less.

523
00:23:53,683 --> 00:23:55,185
It's a gift
from the Monitor.

524
00:23:58,146 --> 00:23:59,648
- [Oliver] Barry?
- Hey.

525
00:23:59,981 --> 00:24:02,108
Did you go out shopping
for a new costume

526
00:24:02,275 --> 00:24:04,170
while you were supposed
to be out saving the world?

527
00:24:04,194 --> 00:24:06,196
What? Uh, no. No.

528
00:24:06,363 --> 00:24:08,049
I-it's a crazy, long story,
and you wouldn't

529
00:24:08,073 --> 00:24:09,073
believe me if I told you.

530
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:11,284
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

531
00:24:12,869 --> 00:24:14,663
[Barry]
Please. [stammering] Excuse us.

532
00:24:16,831 --> 00:24:17,874
Are you okay?

533
00:24:19,084 --> 00:24:21,836
What I'm about to tell you
isn't gonna make any sense,

534
00:24:22,003 --> 00:24:26,174
but... you're not really
h-here right now.

535
00:24:26,341 --> 00:24:28,134
- You're actually...
- In the speed force.

[bright music]

537
00:24:32,347 --> 00:24:33,640
I remember. I...

538
00:24:36,685 --> 00:24:37,894
I remember everything.

539
00:24:38,186 --> 00:24:40,522
Okay. Well,
in that case...

540
00:24:42,857 --> 00:24:45,694
that arrow...
from the Monitor,

541
00:24:47,612 --> 00:24:49,531
I always felt like
there was something

542
00:24:49,698 --> 00:24:50,699
you weren't telling me.

543
00:24:53,952 --> 00:24:55,996
I didn't want to burden
you with the choice I made.

544
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,039
The choice to do what?

545
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:01,042
You and Kara, Barry,

546
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:05,505
you were fated to die
trying to save the world.

547
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:07,716
[dramatic music]

548
00:25:09,926 --> 00:25:11,219
Right before you died,

549
00:25:12,303 --> 00:25:15,348
you said you'd given up everything
for me and Kara.

550
00:25:17,017 --> 00:25:18,685
You made some kind
of devil's bargain

551
00:25:18,852 --> 00:25:20,412
with the Monitor to save us,
didn't you?

552
00:25:20,478 --> 00:25:22,022
No. It wasn't
a devil's bargain, Barry,

553
00:25:22,188 --> 00:25:24,190
and I'd make it again
in a second.

554
00:25:24,357 --> 00:25:26,192
It cost you
your family, Oliver.

555
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:28,193
Cost you your life.

556
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:30,280
Dying's the easy part.

557

[Oliver]
The dead are at peace,

559
00:25:36,578 --> 00:25:38,163
who have to keep going.

560
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:42,667
Go find the others.

Laurel.

00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:03,563
Laurel, it's time.
It's time to put her to rest.

What am I supposed to tell my parents?

565
00:26:08,693 --> 00:26:10,862
My father, he...
he has a bad heart.

566

He won't live through this.

[breathes shakily]

00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,164
It should have been me.

569
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:24,459
She was
the true hero.

570
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,255
A hero sets
an example, Laurel...

571
00:26:31,591 --> 00:26:32,717
so follow hers.

572
00:26:34,677 --> 00:26:35,678
Wear the mask.

573
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:38,306
Be the Canary.

No, obviously.

Hi. Lex Luthor.

585
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:20,640
I'm here to make you an offer
I won't let you refuse.

586
00:27:20,807 --> 00:27:21,850
How did you get in here?

587
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,685
Our security
protocols are...

588
00:27:23,852 --> 00:27:24,852
[Lex] A joke,

589
00:27:24,978 --> 00:27:27,730
but the fact that I was able
to circumvent them with astonishing ease

590
00:27:27,897 --> 00:27:29,649
is exactly why you need
to listen to me.

591
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,360
- Xneen?
- Is taking a little nappy time.

592
00:27:32,527 --> 00:27:33,527
Not to worry.

593
00:27:33,945 --> 00:27:36,906
So you are a scientist.

594
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:40,368
Tell me you're not intrigued
by what I have to say,

595
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:43,830
or do you get regular visits
from humans with future knowledge?

596
00:27:45,915 --> 00:27:46,915
Speak.

597
00:27:47,542 --> 00:27:48,960
The experiment
you're conducting

598
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,753
will not only
destroy you

599
00:27:51,171 --> 00:27:53,173
but your planet
and your wife.

600
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,384
Another ancient zealot.
I am so sick...

601
00:27:56,551 --> 00:27:57,467
Don't know
who they are.

602
00:27:57,468 --> 00:27:58,696
I'm not even
from this universe.

What I am from
is the future,

so I know exactly how your little
time-jumping experiment will go wrong,

605
00:28:04,934 --> 00:28:09,397
and I am willing to share
my future knowledge with you.

606
00:28:10,481 --> 00:28:11,481
And in return?

607
00:28:12,108 --> 00:28:14,485
Well, I don't cotton
to aliens,

608
00:28:14,652 --> 00:28:18,072
but you will soon have
certain abilities

609
00:28:18,656 --> 00:28:20,617
that I will need in order
to deal with some,

super problems

in my world.

I do not have
any... abilities.

Stick with me, kid.

really actually happening.

What are you talk... hey! Hey!

621
00:28:57,612 --> 00:28:58,655
Don't you touch her!

622
00:28:58,821 --> 00:28:59,739

00:29:08,623 --> 00:29:10,750
- What's happening?
- It's a long, very weird story.

628
00:29:10,917 --> 00:29:13,086
- I'll catch you up on the way.
- On the way to where?

629
00:29:13,253 --> 00:29:14,438
You're not taking
her anywhere.

630
00:29:14,462 --> 00:29:15,463
I'm sorry.

The Anti-Monitor.

an actual name.

[somber music]

642
00:29:36,276 --> 00:29:39,946
The two of you...
work together.

643
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:42,170
[J'onn]
I know you don't trust each other.

644
00:29:42,532 --> 00:29:44,951
Right now, I know you
don't even like each other,

645
00:29:46,077 --> 00:29:48,579
but all that changes.

646
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:53,293
In fact, we all come
to depend on each other.

647
00:29:54,294 --> 00:29:56,212
We all come to
trust each other.

648
00:29:57,547 --> 00:29:59,299
[echoing]
Why are you telling us this now?

650
00:30:03,261 --> 00:30:05,430
[Kate, echoing]
This seems to be a pattern with you.

651
00:30:06,472 --> 00:30:09,309
You don't trust people.
They don't trust you.

652
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:12,186
Then all
of that changes,

653
00:30:13,354 --> 00:30:15,794
[normal voice] and the bond
between you is stronger than iron.

654
00:30:16,899 --> 00:30:18,776
I'm sorry.
What's your point?

655
00:30:20,528 --> 00:30:22,822
It's maybe something
I can learn from.

656

[energy crackling]

657
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:26,891
So basically, you tore
a little hole

658
00:30:27,035 --> 00:30:28,411
in the space-time
continuum,

659
00:30:28,661 --> 00:30:31,181
opened a doorway into something
called the anti-matter universe.

660
00:30:31,622 --> 00:30:33,833
Matter and anti-matter
cannot coexist.

661
00:30:34,125 --> 00:30:35,686
Hence a lot of bad stuff
happening that we would

662
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:36,961
just as soon not
have happen,

663
00:30:37,712 --> 00:30:40,465
so I think what we need to do is adjust
the Ronstrom coefficient.

Mar Novu, do not trust
this man with anything!

Give him a knife
for his food,

and no matter how much
he thanks you for the dinner,

669
00:31:01,235 --> 00:31:02,835
he'll stab you right
in the back with it.

I'm not choosy.

by surprise.

That's not gonna
happen again.

673

Get Novu outta here.

No. This isn't
a warning kind of situation.

683
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,767
This is a don't do it
at any... cost kind of situation.

684
00:31:32,934 --> 00:31:33,976
It is my life's work.

685

Trillions of other

687

and demand belief.

692
00:31:48,449 --> 00:31:51,911
The fact I'm here at all
should be enough to convince you.

You are a remarkable
individual.

694

a double-cross

00:32:17,603 --> 00:32:19,522
if I never trusted you
in the first place?

Why do you Kryptonians always
have to take things so personally?

803
00:37:51,479 --> 00:37:52,914
[Kara] He said you
would know what to do.

804
00:37:52,938 --> 00:37:54,618
I think dying kind of
messed with his head.

805
00:37:54,648 --> 00:37:56,126
Well, think.
You're meant to be the genius.

806
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:57,627
[J'onn] A genius who's had
the fortitude

807
00:37:57,651 --> 00:37:59,945
to read The Book of Destiny
and retain his sanity.

808
00:38:00,112 --> 00:38:01,739
I think the jury's
still out on that one.

809
00:38:02,072 --> 00:38:03,240
The Book of Destiny.

810
00:38:03,908 --> 00:38:06,202
I made myself
the Paragon of Truth.

811
00:38:06,744 --> 00:38:09,455
What if truth can
tell us what we need to do?

812
00:38:09,663 --> 00:38:10,663
Being what?

813
00:38:11,707 --> 00:38:13,626
Use what's left
of the book

814
00:38:13,793 --> 00:38:15,085
to fan the flame.

815
00:38:15,294 --> 00:38:16,629
How do we all
use the book?

816
00:38:18,339 --> 00:38:19,465
We focus.

817
00:38:21,133 --> 00:38:23,719
[Kara]
A singular, laser-like focus.

818
00:38:24,178 --> 00:38:25,178
[Ryan] On what?

819
00:38:25,179 --> 00:38:26,222
Humanity,

820
00:38:27,765 --> 00:38:28,808
truth,

821
00:38:29,517 --> 00:38:30,517
love,

822
00:38:31,352 --> 00:38:32,394
destiny,

823
00:38:33,521 --> 00:38:34,521
honor,

824
00:38:35,356 --> 00:38:36,565
courage...

825
00:38:38,526 --> 00:38:39,526
and hope.

826
00:38:39,652 --> 00:38:42,947
[dramatic music]

827
00:38:48,536 --> 00:38:50,830
[energy rushing]

828
00:38:54,708 --> 00:38:55,708
No!

829
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,297
[rumbling]

830
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,758
No!

831
00:39:02,925 --> 00:39:04,343
[screaming]

832
00:39:05,135 --> 00:39:07,930
[rumbling]

833
00:39:10,724 --> 00:39:11,724
Oh, my God!

834
00:39:12,518 --> 00:39:14,937
- Oliver!
- Barry, get us there.

835
00:39:15,521 --> 00:39:16,521
[energy crackles]

836
00:39:18,399 --> 00:39:20,860
[moaning]

837
00:39:21,527 --> 00:39:22,319
[Barry]
Oliver.

838
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,156
[coughing]

839
00:39:25,573 --> 00:39:26,657
I...

840
00:39:27,658 --> 00:39:29,827
I need both of you to watch
over my family.

841
00:39:29,994 --> 00:39:31,596
Hey, Ollie. They're
gonna be fine, all right?

842
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:32,705
You're gonna be fine.

843
00:39:32,872 --> 00:39:34,665
[panting]

844
00:39:35,124 --> 00:39:36,208
You did it.

845
00:39:37,084 --> 00:39:39,003
You all did...
you all did it.

846
00:39:39,587 --> 00:39:40,796
Did what?
What did we do?

847
00:39:41,463 --> 00:39:42,506
Just look.

848
00:39:42,673 --> 00:39:44,550
[energy rumbling]

849
00:39:44,925 --> 00:39:47,386
[somber music]

850
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:50,681
Ollie, we saw,
but what is it?

851
00:39:51,682 --> 00:39:53,267
It's the new universe.

852
00:39:53,767 --> 00:39:55,811
It's kind of small for a universe.

853
00:39:56,061 --> 00:39:57,229
Wait for it, Barry.

854
00:39:58,898 --> 00:40:02,526
It's almost time,
almost time.

855
00:40:02,693 --> 00:40:04,153
[rumbling]

856
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,947
There. You did it.

857
00:40:07,114 --> 00:40:09,241
No, Ollie,
you did it, okay,

858
00:40:09,408 --> 00:40:11,128
and that's why you got to
come back with us,

859
00:40:11,243 --> 00:40:12,745
so we need you to
hang on, okay?

860
00:40:12,912 --> 00:40:15,581
Sara, this is just what the Monitor
said would happen.

861
00:40:16,081 --> 00:40:17,124
[coughs]

862
00:40:17,374 --> 00:40:18,709
- No.
- What?

863
00:40:18,876 --> 00:40:19,877
[tender music]

864
00:40:20,044 --> 00:40:21,420
There was an end...

865
00:40:24,256 --> 00:40:25,716
and there's a beginning.

866
00:40:29,261 --> 00:40:30,971
You remember what I told you?

867
00:40:33,682 --> 00:40:35,184
Dying is the easy part.

868
00:40:38,437 --> 00:40:39,730
I'm at peace.

869
00:40:42,775 --> 00:40:43,984
The real heroes...

870
00:40:44,443 --> 00:40:46,028
They're the ones who
have to keep going.

871
00:40:46,904 --> 00:40:49,907
So keep... going...

872
00:40:53,869 --> 00:40:55,412
don't ever stop.

873
00:40:56,747 --> 00:41:01,168
This world,
this new world...

874
00:41:03,671 --> 00:41:05,172
it needs both of you.

875
00:41:05,422 --> 00:41:08,092
[wind howling]

876
00:41:08,258 --> 00:41:11,011
[somber music]

877
00:41:26,902 --> 00:41:28,070
Barry...

878
00:41:35,452 --> 00:41:36,495
An end.

879
00:41:37,913 --> 00:41:39,248
And a beginning.

880
00:41:46,714 --> 00:41:48,132
Thank you, Oliver.

881
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:25,753
[Man] Greg, move your head!
