1
00:00:20,907 --> 00:00:23,785
Long ago, in ancient China,

2
00:00:23,785 --> 00:00:27,019
the Peacocks ruled over Gongmen City.

3
00:00:27,787 --> 00:00:31,462
They brought great joy
and prosperity to the city

4
00:00:31,462 --> 00:00:34,824
for they had invented fireworks.

5
00:00:38,067 --> 00:00:40,706
But their son, Lord Shen,

6
00:00:40,706 --> 00:00:44,143
saw darker power in the fireworks.

7
00:00:45,307 --> 00:00:47,696
What had brought colour and joy

8
00:00:47,696 --> 00:00:52,065
could also bring darkness and destruction.

9
00:00:52,065 --> 00:00:55,856
Shen's troubled parents
consulted a soothsayer.

10
00:00:55,856 --> 00:01:01,101
She foretold that if Shen
continued down this dark path,

11
00:01:01,101 --> 00:01:06,057
he would be defeated
by a warrior of black and white.

12
00:01:07,147 --> 00:01:10,617
The young lord
set out to change his fate.

13
00:01:10,617 --> 00:01:15,417
But what he did next only sealed it.

14
00:01:20,227 --> 00:01:23,936
Shen returned to his parents
full of pride.

15
00:01:23,936 --> 00:01:28,066
But in their faces, he saw only horror.

16
00:01:29,747 --> 00:01:32,466
He was banished from the city forever.

17
00:01:32,466 --> 00:01:35,699
But Shen swore revenge.

18
00:01:35,699 --> 00:01:38,586
Someday he would return

19
00:01:38,586 --> 00:01:42,456
and all of China would bow at his feet.

20
00:02:12,627 --> 00:02:15,425
It's almost done, Lord Shen,
but we have run out of metal.

21
00:02:16,947 --> 00:02:21,259
Search the farthest villages.
Find more metal.

22
00:02:21,259 --> 00:02:23,224
China will be mine.

23
00:02:32,947 --> 00:02:36,019
And then the Dragon Warrior
joined the Furious Five.

24
00:02:36,019 --> 00:02:38,940
And they became the most
awesomest kung fu team ever.

25
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,859
Enough talk. Let's fight.

26
00:02:42,067 --> 00:02:43,102
- Thirty-three...
- Listen, listen.

27
00:02:43,102 --> 00:02:45,497
You can hear the Dragon Warrior
training right now.

28
00:02:45,497 --> 00:02:47,020
Thirty-three. Stop him.

29
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,381
- Thirty-four.
- It's too dangerous.

30
00:02:48,381 --> 00:02:50,777
- Thirty-five. Stay focused.
- Thirty-six.

31
00:02:50,777 --> 00:02:52,539
- Thirty-seven.
- Yeah.

32
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:55,062
How is he doing that with his face?

33
00:02:58,627 --> 00:03:01,141
Thirty-eight bean buns.

34
00:03:01,141 --> 00:03:03,741
Yes. New record. You monster.

35
00:03:03,741 --> 00:03:06,102
- Keep going. Hit 40.
- He will never hit 40.

36
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:08,383
You guys wait and we will go to 40.

37
00:03:08,383 --> 00:03:09,616
Do it.

38
00:03:09,616 --> 00:03:11,140
No problem.

39
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,699
Yeah.

40
00:03:16,787 --> 00:03:18,140
Give me a minute.

41
00:03:19,347 --> 00:03:20,700
Yeah.

42
00:03:21,667 --> 00:03:23,783
- He did it.
- Well done, Po.

43
00:03:25,307 --> 00:03:26,660
Your training has paid off.

44
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:29,898
Master Shifu.
Got to go. See you later.

45
00:03:30,907 --> 00:03:32,863
You will save those for me, right?

46
00:03:40,947 --> 00:03:42,300
Flippety-do.

47
00:03:52,507 --> 00:03:54,020
Inner peace.

48
00:03:56,907 --> 00:03:59,296
Inner peace.

49
00:04:02,427 --> 00:04:04,179
Inner peace.

50
00:04:04,179 --> 00:04:05,700
Master Shifu.

51
00:04:06,627 --> 00:04:08,458
Master Shifu, what do we got?

52
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:11,425
Pirates? Vandals of Volcano Mountain?

53
00:04:11,425 --> 00:04:15,466
Whatever it is, I will take them down.
Because I am in a mood.

54
00:04:15,466 --> 00:04:17,936
I need to get something done,
you know what I mean?

55
00:04:19,787 --> 00:04:20,981
What are you doing?

56
00:04:20,981 --> 00:04:24,423
One of Master Oogway's final teachings.

57
00:04:54,387 --> 00:04:55,376
Awesome.

58
00:04:55,376 --> 00:04:58,345
How did you do that?

59
00:04:58,345 --> 00:05:02,341
- Inner peace.
- Inner peace. That's cool.

60
00:05:03,227 --> 00:05:06,663
- Inner peace of what?
- It is the next phase of your training.

61
00:05:06,663 --> 00:05:12,424
Every master must find his path
to inner peace.

62
00:05:12,424 --> 00:05:16,580
Some choose to meditate for 50 years
in a cave just like this...

63
00:05:18,547 --> 00:05:21,539
...without the slightest taste
of food or water.

64
00:05:23,227 --> 00:05:24,262
Or?

65
00:05:24,262 --> 00:05:27,737
Some find it through
pain and suffering, as I did.

66
00:05:27,737 --> 00:05:31,138
Po, the day you were chosen
as Dragon Warrior

67
00:05:31,138 --> 00:05:33,059
was the worst day of my life.

68
00:05:33,907 --> 00:05:36,341
By far. Nothing else came close.

69
00:05:36,341 --> 00:05:40,705
It was the worst, most painful,
mind-destroying, horrible moment...

70
00:05:40,705 --> 00:05:43,222
OK.
...I have ever experienced.

71
00:05:47,067 --> 00:05:50,980
But once I realised the problem
was not you, but within me,

72
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:56,505
I found inner peace and was able
to harness the flow of the universe.

73
00:05:56,505 --> 00:05:59,101
So that's it? I just need inner peace?

74
00:05:59,101 --> 00:06:01,303
My innards are
already super, super peaceful,

75
00:06:01,303 --> 00:06:04,743
so all I need to do
is just get this thing going.

76
00:06:04,743 --> 00:06:06,784
Inner peace, you're going down.

77
00:06:06,784 --> 00:06:08,665
Now show me what you were
doing there with your feet.

78
00:06:08,665 --> 00:06:09,862
I saw you do sort of a fancy foot...

79
00:06:09,862 --> 00:06:12,905
Po. Bandits.
Approaching the Musicians Village.

80
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:14,102
Danger.

81
00:06:14,102 --> 00:06:18,021
Tell those musicians to start playing
some action music because it is on.

82
00:06:18,021 --> 00:06:20,462
Don't worry, Shifu, I will master
inner peace as soon as I get back.

83
00:06:20,462 --> 00:06:22,185
No snack stops this time.

84
00:06:23,147 --> 00:06:24,944
Snack stops.

85
00:06:24,944 --> 00:06:26,745
Wait, are you serious?

86
00:06:38,787 --> 00:06:40,778
Get all the metal you can find.

87
00:06:44,667 --> 00:06:45,895
Grab the metal.

88
00:06:51,267 --> 00:06:53,417
Help, help, help, help. Help.

89
00:06:56,507 --> 00:06:58,657
That's everything.
Let's get out of here.

90
00:06:59,787 --> 00:07:00,856
Oh, no.

91
00:07:05,987 --> 00:07:07,898
Wings of Justice.

92
00:07:26,107 --> 00:07:27,256
The Dragon Warrior.

93
00:07:27,256 --> 00:07:29,622
A panda? That's impossible.

94
00:07:29,622 --> 00:07:31,618
My fist hungers for justice.

95
00:07:32,787 --> 00:07:34,379
That was my... fist.

96
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:36,777
- Get them.
- Come on.

97
00:07:59,067 --> 00:08:00,341
Take that.

98
00:08:10,307 --> 00:08:11,865
Po. Incoming.

99
00:08:11,865 --> 00:08:13,779
Thanks, Mantis.

100
00:08:31,467 --> 00:08:33,219
Tigress, Double Death Strike.

101
00:08:41,667 --> 00:08:42,656
Feet of Fury.

102
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:49,222
Tigress. Monkey.

103
00:08:49,222 --> 00:08:51,264
Viper. Mantis.

104
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:53,179
Bunny. What?

105
00:08:54,027 --> 00:08:55,096
Oh, sorry.

106
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:01,896
Help.

107
00:09:02,987 --> 00:09:04,864
- Crane, go.
- I am on it.

108
00:09:23,227 --> 00:09:24,740
Is everyone OK?

109
00:09:25,267 --> 00:09:27,223
That was awesome.

110
00:09:29,867 --> 00:09:30,856
I got this.

111
00:09:41,707 --> 00:09:42,935
Po.

112
00:09:48,947 --> 00:09:50,426
Chew on that, tubby.

113
00:09:56,307 --> 00:09:57,626
Help.

114
00:09:59,627 --> 00:10:01,857
- Sweetie, are you OK?
- What happened?

115
00:10:03,427 --> 00:10:05,065
I think I saw...

116
00:10:05,065 --> 00:10:07,457
I think...

117
00:10:07,457 --> 00:10:08,980
I got to go.

118
00:10:11,227 --> 00:10:16,255
Thank you. Thank you for coming
to Dragon Warrior Noodles and Tofu.

119
00:10:16,255 --> 00:10:18,099
- More tea? Lemon sauce?
- No.

120
00:10:18,099 --> 00:10:20,906
If you need anything, just ask.

121
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:24,620
- Thank you.
- Feet of Fury.

122
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:29,065
The Dragon Warrior's mop.
He mopped these very floors.

123
00:10:29,667 --> 00:10:32,420
No touching.
You will get the mop dirty.

124
00:10:33,027 --> 00:10:34,824
- He once waited on me.
- Awesome.

125
00:10:34,824 --> 00:10:38,741
Yeah, I have the stain to prove it.
Hey, where is the Dragon Warrior?

126
00:10:38,741 --> 00:10:41,137
He doesn't work here any more.

127
00:10:41,137 --> 00:10:44,663
He's busy out there protecting the Valley.

128
00:10:44,663 --> 00:10:46,260
- The Dragon Warrior.
- There he is.

129
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,416
Po.

130
00:10:49,467 --> 00:10:51,856
- Here. OK. Nice kid.
- The Dragon Warrior.

131
00:10:51,856 --> 00:10:54,177
- Should have told me you were coming.
- Hi, Dad.

132
00:10:54,177 --> 00:10:56,497
I would have saved you some stinky tofu.

133
00:10:58,107 --> 00:11:00,985
- Dad, can I talk to you?
- Of course, son.

134
00:11:01,707 --> 00:11:07,065
In honour of my son,
free tofu dessert for everybody.

135
00:11:07,065 --> 00:11:09,024
With purchases.

136
00:11:09,024 --> 00:11:12,657
Oh, it's so good to see you, Po.

137
00:11:12,657 --> 00:11:16,297
Have you lost weight? I can
almost put my wings around you.

138
00:11:16,297 --> 00:11:18,059
Ah, well, maybe a little.

139
00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:21,902
Poor you, you must feel weak.
Let me get you some soup.

140
00:11:21,902 --> 00:11:23,580
No, that's OK, Dad. I am not hungry.

141
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:26,307
Not hungry? Po, are you all right?

142
00:11:26,307 --> 00:11:28,344
Yeah. No, I am fine. I just...

143
00:11:28,344 --> 00:11:30,737
Earlier today, I was fighting these bandits.

144
00:11:30,737 --> 00:11:34,024
Nothing too dangerous.
I mean, they were just, you know...

145
00:11:34,024 --> 00:11:37,020
- Yeah?
- And then the strangest thing happened.

146
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,825
I had this crazy vision.

147
00:11:38,825 --> 00:11:42,616
I think I saw my mom and me, as a baby.

148
00:11:43,107 --> 00:11:45,302
Mom? A baby?

149
00:11:45,302 --> 00:11:48,698
- Dad?
- What...?

150
00:11:49,787 --> 00:11:51,743
How do I say this?

151
00:11:53,187 --> 00:11:55,098
Where did I come from?

152
00:11:58,827 --> 00:12:04,379
Well, you see, son,
baby geese come from a little egg.

153
00:12:04,747 --> 00:12:09,025
- Don't ask where the egg comes from.
- Dad, that's not what I meant.

154
00:12:10,307 --> 00:12:12,263
I know it's not.

155
00:12:12,263 --> 00:12:17,501
I think it's time I told you something
I should have told you a long time ago.

156
00:12:18,267 --> 00:12:19,382
OK.

157
00:12:19,382 --> 00:12:23,222
You might have been kind of a...

158
00:12:26,587 --> 00:12:28,179
...adopted.

159
00:12:28,179 --> 00:12:30,099
- I knew it.
- You knew?

160
00:12:30,099 --> 00:12:33,100
- Well, who told you?
- No one. I mean, come on, Dad.

161
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,986
But if you knew,
why didn't you ever say anything?

162
00:12:35,986 --> 00:12:37,944
Why didn't you say anything?

163
00:12:40,187 --> 00:12:42,747
How did I get here, Dad?
Where did I come from?

164
00:12:44,387 --> 00:12:47,697
Actually... you came from this.

165
00:12:51,467 --> 00:12:54,186
It was just another day at the restaurant.

166
00:12:54,186 --> 00:12:55,905
Time to make the noodles.

167
00:12:56,667 --> 00:13:00,979
I went out to the back, where my
vegetables had just been delivered.

168
00:13:00,979 --> 00:13:03,741
There were cabbages, turnips, radishes.

169
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:07,381
Only there were no radishes.

170
00:13:07,381 --> 00:13:10,823
Just a very hungry baby panda.

171
00:13:13,547 --> 00:13:15,219
There was no note.

172
00:13:15,219 --> 00:13:17,343
Of course, you could have eaten it.

173
00:13:17,343 --> 00:13:22,297
I waited for someone to come
looking for you, but no one did.

174
00:13:45,307 --> 00:13:47,218
I brought you inside.

175
00:13:49,387 --> 00:13:50,945
Fed you.

176
00:13:52,547 --> 00:13:53,980
Gave you a bath.

177
00:13:56,867 --> 00:13:58,778
And fed you again.

178
00:14:01,147 --> 00:14:02,705
And again.

179
00:14:04,827 --> 00:14:07,387
And tried to put some pants on you.

180
00:14:15,627 --> 00:14:19,415
And then I made a decision
that would change my life forever.

181
00:14:21,507 --> 00:14:24,499
To make my soup without radishes.

182
00:14:24,499 --> 00:14:28,740
And to raise you as my own son.

183
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:32,946
Xiao Po, my little panda.

184
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:38,259
And from that moment on,
both my soup and my life

185
00:14:38,259 --> 00:14:40,497
have been that much sweeter.

186
00:14:41,507 --> 00:14:44,499
And, little Po,
that's the end of the story.

187
00:14:45,787 --> 00:14:48,665
Look at me. No, don't look at me.

188
00:14:48,665 --> 00:14:53,139
That's it? That can't be it.
There's got to be more, Dad.

189
00:14:53,139 --> 00:14:57,346
Well, there was the time
you ate all my bamboo furniture.

190
00:14:57,346 --> 00:14:59,418
It was imported, too.

191
00:14:59,987 --> 00:15:02,626
One dumpling, please,
Dragon Warrior size.

192
00:15:07,747 --> 00:15:11,456
Oh, Po, your story may not
have such a happy beginning,

193
00:15:11,747 --> 00:15:13,066
but look how it turned out.

194
00:15:13,066 --> 00:15:16,822
You got me, you got kung fu,
and you got noodles.

195
00:15:16,822 --> 00:15:19,547
I know. I just have so many questions.

196
00:15:19,547 --> 00:15:22,016
Like how did I ever fit
in this tiny basket?

197
00:15:22,016 --> 00:15:23,779
Why didn't I like pants?

198
00:15:26,027 --> 00:15:27,938
And who am I?

199
00:15:34,787 --> 00:15:36,664
Good. Watch your form.

200
00:15:39,267 --> 00:15:40,666
Good.

201
00:15:42,187 --> 00:15:44,860
Better. Elbow.

202
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,938
Straighten it out.

203
00:16:11,667 --> 00:16:13,783
Shen?

204
00:16:13,783 --> 00:16:16,780
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

205
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:21,498
Now we have got the pleasantries
out of the way, please leave my house.

206
00:16:21,498 --> 00:16:23,703
- Your house?
- Yes.

207
00:16:23,703 --> 00:16:26,256
Didn't you see the peacock
on the front door?

208
00:16:28,147 --> 00:16:30,217
There you are, Soothsayer.

209
00:16:30,787 --> 00:16:35,338
It seems your fortune-telling skills
are not as good as you thought.

210
00:16:35,338 --> 00:16:39,341
- We shall see, Shen.
- No, you shall see, old goat.

211
00:16:39,341 --> 00:16:41,941
- Where were we?
- What do you want, Shen?

212
00:16:41,941 --> 00:16:46,419
What is rightfully mine. Gongmen City.

213
00:16:46,419 --> 00:16:49,147
Gongmen is under the stewardship
of the Masters' Council,

214
00:16:49,147 --> 00:16:52,982
and we will protect it. Even from you.

215
00:16:54,107 --> 00:16:57,224
I am so glad you feel that way.

216
00:16:57,224 --> 00:17:00,106
Otherwise, I'd have dragged
that here for nothing.

217
00:17:00,106 --> 00:17:02,223
What's in the box, Shen?

218
00:17:02,223 --> 00:17:05,777
You want to see? It's a gift.

219
00:17:05,777 --> 00:17:09,576
It's your parting gift,
in that it will part you.

220
00:17:09,576 --> 00:17:11,226
Part of you here, part of you there

221
00:17:11,226 --> 00:17:15,175
and part of you way over there,
staining the wall.

222
00:17:15,175 --> 00:17:17,258
You insolent fool.

223
00:17:34,267 --> 00:17:36,940
- Show-off.
- That is a warning.

224
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:39,826
You are no match for our kung fu.

225
00:17:39,826 --> 00:17:41,864
I agree.

226
00:17:41,864 --> 00:17:43,665
But this is.

227
00:17:57,067 --> 00:17:59,706
Are you familiar
with the master of Gongmen City?

228
00:17:59,706 --> 00:18:01,141
- Master Thundering Rhino?
- Yes.

229
00:18:01,141 --> 00:18:03,775
- Son of legendary Flying Rhino?
- Yes.

230
00:18:03,775 --> 00:18:06,780
And slayer of the Ten Thousand
Serpents in the Valley of Woe?

231
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,903
- He's dead.
- Whoa.

232
00:18:08,903 --> 00:18:10,216
That's impossible.

233
00:18:10,216 --> 00:18:12,742
Rhino's Horn Defence
is impervious to any technique.

234
00:18:12,742 --> 00:18:16,263
It was no technique.
Lord Shen has created a weapon,

235
00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:18,736
one that breathes fire and spits metal.

236
00:18:19,347 --> 00:18:24,023
Unless he is stopped,
this could be the end of kung fu.

237
00:18:24,667 --> 00:18:28,376
- But I just got kung fu.
- And now you must save it.

238
00:18:28,376 --> 00:18:32,301
Go. Destroy this weapon
and bring Lord Shen to justice.

239
00:18:32,301 --> 00:18:34,219
OK, here we go. Here we go.

240
00:18:35,427 --> 00:18:37,941
Wait a second. How can I do this?

241
00:18:37,941 --> 00:18:40,621
I mean, how can kung fu stop
something that stops kung fu?

242
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:42,618
Remember, Dragon Warrior,

243
00:18:42,618 --> 00:18:46,018
anything is possible
when you have inner peace.

244
00:18:51,507 --> 00:18:54,101
Inner peace. Inner peace. Inner peace.

245
00:18:54,907 --> 00:18:55,942
Peace on.

246
00:18:55,942 --> 00:18:58,063
- Oh, Po?
- Peace.

247
00:18:58,063 --> 00:19:00,263
Oh, Po, I got you a travel pack.

248
00:19:00,263 --> 00:19:03,385
I packed you food for weeks.
Cookies, buns, vegetables.

249
00:19:03,385 --> 00:19:06,664
And I even packed
all your action figures. See?

250
00:19:09,627 --> 00:19:12,778
I don't know what those are.
Never seen them before in my life.

251
00:19:12,778 --> 00:19:14,744
Dad, you got scratches on my Tigress.

252
00:19:14,744 --> 00:19:17,660
I also packed your paintings
of our best time together,

253
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:20,261
just in case you get lonely.

254
00:19:20,261 --> 00:19:24,102
That's me and you making noodles.
And that's me and you eating noodles.

255
00:19:24,102 --> 00:19:26,576
And that's me giving you a piggyback ride.

256
00:19:27,987 --> 00:19:30,820
That cute? On second thought,
I will hang on to this one.

257
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:34,696
- Hey, they're waiting for me.
- Of course, of course.

258
00:19:34,696 --> 00:19:37,904
You have a job to do... far from home,

259
00:19:37,904 --> 00:19:41,616
in a strange city, filled with
strange people, and strange noodles,

260
00:19:41,616 --> 00:19:45,382
facing horrible danger
from which you might never return.

261
00:19:45,382 --> 00:19:48,015
- Don't go, Po.
- I got to go.

262
00:19:48,015 --> 00:19:51,338
I am the Dragon Warrior.
It's kind of my job to save kung fu.

263
00:19:51,338 --> 00:19:54,340
And if I don't... what am I?

264
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:56,862
You're my son.

265
00:19:59,427 --> 00:20:00,496
Right?

266
00:20:01,787 --> 00:20:04,745
- Po, it's time.
- Goodbye.

267
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,100
Don't worry, Mr. Ping.

268
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,542
He will be back before
you can say "noodles".

269
00:20:16,027 --> 00:20:17,938
Noodles.

270
00:20:24,147 --> 00:20:25,865
Come on, guys, let's go.

271
00:20:25,865 --> 00:20:27,176
Yeah.

272
00:20:29,867 --> 00:20:31,380
Yeah...

273
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:34,186
Yeah, yeah. Yeah...

274
00:21:50,507 --> 00:21:51,701
Mama?

275
00:21:56,947 --> 00:21:59,666
Mom? Dad? Is that you?

276
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:02,057
Mom. Dad.

277
00:22:03,867 --> 00:22:06,142
Oh, hi. Hey, son. You're back.

278
00:22:07,707 --> 00:22:09,459
Honey, what are you doing here?

279
00:22:09,459 --> 00:22:10,616
But I thought...

280
00:22:10,616 --> 00:22:13,585
We replaced you, dear,
with this lovely radish.

281
00:22:14,627 --> 00:22:17,619
- Radish?
- It's quiet, polite, and, frankly,

282
00:22:17,619 --> 00:22:19,584
does better kung fu.

283
00:22:20,227 --> 00:22:21,865
No. No, no, no.

284
00:22:25,747 --> 00:22:26,736
Wait.

285
00:22:32,707 --> 00:22:33,696
No.

286
00:22:41,907 --> 00:22:44,467
Radish, radish, radish, radish.

287
00:22:52,667 --> 00:22:54,419
Inner pea...

288
00:22:57,107 --> 00:22:58,142
Pea...

289
00:23:00,507 --> 00:23:02,020
Inner peace.

290
00:23:17,707 --> 00:23:22,337
Inner peace. Inner peace. Inner peace.
Inner peace. Inner peace....

291
00:23:28,027 --> 00:23:29,938
I am... training.

292
00:23:29,938 --> 00:23:32,302
The mast is not a worthy opponent.

293
00:23:35,867 --> 00:23:38,097
- I am ready.
- OK.

294
00:23:38,097 --> 00:23:40,178
So serious.

295
00:23:47,587 --> 00:23:49,578
I think I prefer the mast.

296
00:23:49,578 --> 00:23:54,263
Apologies. I used to punch the
ironwood trees by the palace to train.

297
00:23:54,263 --> 00:23:55,701
Now I feel nothing.

298
00:23:56,667 --> 00:23:58,623
That's severely cool.

299
00:24:01,427 --> 00:24:02,416
Again.

300
00:24:04,827 --> 00:24:09,059
So, this punching ironwood trees,
how long did you have to do that?

301
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:11,866
- Twenty years.
- Oh, 20, 20 years.

302
00:24:12,747 --> 00:24:14,897
Is there any, you know, faster way?

303
00:24:14,897 --> 00:24:17,661
You know, until you, you know,
don't feel anything?

304
00:24:17,661 --> 00:24:19,704
No. Besides...

305
00:24:23,547 --> 00:24:26,425
...I don't think hard style is your thing.

306
00:24:30,747 --> 00:24:33,261
Po, why are you really out here?

307
00:24:34,547 --> 00:24:37,778
I just found out that my dad
isn't really my dad.

308
00:24:39,787 --> 00:24:41,505
Your dad? The goose.

309
00:24:44,027 --> 00:24:46,177
That must have been quite a shock.

310
00:24:46,177 --> 00:24:47,666
Yeah.

311
00:24:47,666 --> 00:24:51,058
- And this bothers you?
- Are you kidding me?

312
00:24:51,058 --> 00:24:54,105
We're warriors, right? Nerves of steel.

313
00:24:54,105 --> 00:24:56,144
Souls of platinum.

314
00:24:56,144 --> 00:24:57,456
Like you.

315
00:24:57,456 --> 00:24:59,504
So hard-core, you don't feel anything.

316
00:25:03,827 --> 00:25:05,783
- I was...
- So, what are you guys talking about?

317
00:25:06,667 --> 00:25:08,339
Nothing. Nothing.

318
00:25:08,339 --> 00:25:10,543
Po's having daddy issues.

319
00:25:10,543 --> 00:25:13,699
I am so lucky.
I don't have any problems with my dad.

320
00:25:13,699 --> 00:25:16,142
Maybe it's because Mom
ate his head before I was born.

321
00:25:16,142 --> 00:25:19,026
- I don't know.
- Mantis, this isn't about you.

322
00:25:19,026 --> 00:25:21,143
Po is the one freaking out.

323
00:25:21,143 --> 00:25:23,377
- I am not freaking out.
- Po.

324
00:25:23,377 --> 00:25:25,663
- I am freaking in.
- Po.

325
00:25:25,663 --> 00:25:28,387
- What?
- We're here.

326
00:25:28,387 --> 00:25:30,424
Gongmen City.

327
00:25:46,107 --> 00:25:48,541
My father's throne.

328
00:25:48,541 --> 00:25:51,619
He used to let me play here beside him,

329
00:25:51,619 --> 00:25:56,099
promising someday,
this throne would be mine.

330
00:26:00,747 --> 00:26:01,975
A little to the left.

331
00:26:01,975 --> 00:26:04,183
Oh, but it's so heavy, Master.

332
00:26:04,183 --> 00:26:07,498
Thirty years I have waited
for this moment.

333
00:26:07,498 --> 00:26:11,023
Everything must be exactly
how I envisioned it.

334
00:26:11,023 --> 00:26:14,736
And I envisioned it a little to the left.

335
00:26:15,627 --> 00:26:16,855
Perfect.

336
00:26:16,855 --> 00:26:20,099
With the weapon by my si...
A little bit more.

337
00:26:22,187 --> 00:26:27,705
With the weapon by my side,
all of China will bow before me.

338
00:26:27,705 --> 00:26:29,459
We move out in three days,

339
00:26:29,459 --> 00:26:33,302
when the moon is full
and the tide is high.

340
00:26:34,907 --> 00:26:37,899
Now, you old goat,
why don't you tell me my...

341
00:26:37,899 --> 00:26:39,056
Fortune?

342
00:26:39,907 --> 00:26:42,785
Future. I was going to say future.

343
00:26:43,707 --> 00:26:47,143
Look into your bowl
and tell me what glory awaits.

344
00:26:48,787 --> 00:26:52,177
If you continue on your current path...

345
00:26:54,427 --> 00:26:58,261
...you will find yourself
at the bottom of the stairs.

346
00:27:00,787 --> 00:27:02,584
I see...

347
00:27:03,347 --> 00:27:05,258
I see...

348
00:27:05,987 --> 00:27:09,297
I see pain... and anger.

349
00:27:09,297 --> 00:27:12,345
How dare you.
That is the finest silk in the province.

350
00:27:12,345 --> 00:27:13,496
Followed by denial.

351
00:27:13,496 --> 00:27:16,181
This is not fortune-telling.
You're just saying

352
00:27:16,181 --> 00:27:18,258
- what's happening right...
- Now?

353
00:27:19,867 --> 00:27:22,427
The most important time is now.

354
00:27:23,627 --> 00:27:25,936
But if you really want
to see the future...

355
00:27:28,707 --> 00:27:30,299
Oh, what do you see?

356
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:37,739
A peacock...

357
00:27:38,987 --> 00:27:42,900
...is defeated by a warrior
of black and white.

358
00:27:44,067 --> 00:27:45,978
Nothing has changed.

359
00:27:52,267 --> 00:27:54,701
That's impossible, and you know it.

360
00:27:54,701 --> 00:27:57,939
It is not impossible, and he knows it.

361
00:27:57,939 --> 00:27:59,335
Who?

362
00:27:59,335 --> 00:28:02,385
- Lord Shen. I saw a panda.
- A panda?

363
00:28:04,547 --> 00:28:06,742
A kung fu warrior.
It fought like a demon.

364
00:28:06,742 --> 00:28:08,465
Big and furry.

365
00:28:08,465 --> 00:28:11,664
Soft and squishy.
Kind of plush and cuddly.

366
00:28:12,227 --> 00:28:15,299
There are no more pandas.

367
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:18,664
Even with his poor eyesight,
he can see the truth.

368
00:28:18,664 --> 00:28:21,580
Why is it that you cannot?

369
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:25,459
Find this panda and bring him to me.

370
00:28:25,459 --> 00:28:27,299
Yes, sir.

371
00:28:27,299 --> 00:28:31,142
One panda lives.
That does not make you right.

372
00:28:31,142 --> 00:28:34,982
You're right.
Being right makes me right.

373
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:39,335
Then I will kill him and make you wrong.

374
00:28:41,267 --> 00:28:43,178
Will you stop that.

375
00:28:54,867 --> 00:28:57,825
That must be Shen's palace
on the other side of the city.

376
00:28:57,825 --> 00:29:00,421
Great. We will march into the tower
and proclaim,

377
00:29:00,421 --> 00:29:02,543
"We are the Dragon Warrior
and the Furious Five,

378
00:29:02,543 --> 00:29:04,618
and we are here
to bring you to justice".

379
00:29:07,747 --> 00:29:10,466
What are you doing?
This place is crawling with wolves.

380
00:29:15,827 --> 00:29:18,216
Hey, isn't that the guy
who hammered you in the face?

381
00:29:21,547 --> 00:29:23,060
I do not like that guy.

382
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:26,697
We need to get to that tower
without being spotted by those wolves.

383
00:29:26,697 --> 00:29:29,256
Got it. Stealth mode.

384
00:29:51,747 --> 00:29:54,863
- Get out of the way.
- Foiled again.

385
00:29:55,827 --> 00:29:57,545
Now, where'd those noodles go?

386
00:30:03,547 --> 00:30:05,538
Hello. I couldn't help but...

387
00:30:06,307 --> 00:30:08,502
Yeah, OK. Anyway, where was I?

388
00:30:09,427 --> 00:30:11,543
- Where's Po?
- How can we lose a guy that big?

389
00:30:15,267 --> 00:30:16,256
OK.

390
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:24,418
Guys. Guys?

391
00:30:24,418 --> 00:30:26,225
- Hey, Po.
- What? Sorry.

392
00:30:26,225 --> 00:30:27,820
So that was stealth mode, huh?

393
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:30,342
To be honest,
not one of my stronger modes.

394
00:30:30,342 --> 00:30:32,816
...gold in there, come on.

395
00:30:34,107 --> 00:30:35,335
This rice is raw.

396
00:30:35,335 --> 00:30:37,941
You stole all my metal pots for Lord Shen.

397
00:30:37,941 --> 00:30:41,144
Either you cook my rice, or I cook you.

398
00:30:41,144 --> 00:30:43,946
- My apologies, but...
- Po, do something.

399
00:30:43,946 --> 00:30:46,496
How am I supposed to help her cook rice
without getting caught?

400
00:30:46,496 --> 00:30:48,623
Wait, I have a better idea.
Three... two...

401
00:30:48,623 --> 00:30:49,936
...one.

402
00:30:49,936 --> 00:30:51,665
- Hey.
- Hey.

403
00:31:02,507 --> 00:31:04,816
We're here to liberate the city
and bring Shen to justice.

404
00:31:04,816 --> 00:31:06,625
- You will need help.
- Thank you, brave sheep,

405
00:31:06,625 --> 00:31:08,186
but it's too dangerous.
I can't let you.

406
00:31:08,186 --> 00:31:11,384
Oh, no, not me.
It's not safe to speak here.

407
00:31:11,384 --> 00:31:12,946
Right.

408
00:31:15,227 --> 00:31:17,616
I am talking about Masters Ox and Croc.

409
00:31:17,616 --> 00:31:21,018
They're in Gongmen Jail
on Black Dragon Alley.

410
00:31:21,018 --> 00:31:22,745
What? They're still alive?

411
00:31:22,745 --> 00:31:24,818
They must be in that jail
gathering intelligence,

412
00:31:24,818 --> 00:31:27,581
hatching a plot to use their
awesomeness to defeat the weapon.

413
00:31:27,581 --> 00:31:29,339
OK, let's go.

414
00:31:29,339 --> 00:31:32,465
- Thanks, sheep.
- Hey. Stop that costume.

415
00:31:32,465 --> 00:31:34,507
- Hold it right there.
- Get them.

416
00:31:34,507 --> 00:31:36,179
- Get them.
- Sorry.

417
00:31:36,987 --> 00:31:38,420
Take that.

418
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:40,100
- Keep going.
- Faster.

419
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:42,096
Hey, stop.

420
00:32:01,467 --> 00:32:03,378
- Look out. Watch it.
- Sorry.

421
00:32:03,378 --> 00:32:04,582
Surround him.

422
00:32:06,907 --> 00:32:08,340
Now.

423
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,179
Gotcha.

424
00:32:11,187 --> 00:32:12,381
What? Where'd he go?

425
00:32:12,381 --> 00:32:15,220
- Spread out. Search everywhere.
- What about over there?

426
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:19,175
- Is "there" a part of "everywhere"?
- I... I guess.

427
00:32:19,175 --> 00:32:20,746
Then search there.

428
00:32:25,547 --> 00:32:28,823
They must be close. I can feel
a kung fu chill riding up my spine.

429
00:32:28,823 --> 00:32:30,898
Sorry, Po. It's just me.

430
00:32:32,027 --> 00:32:33,938
Look. Gongmen Jail.

431
00:32:37,427 --> 00:32:39,145
Aw, it's cute.

432
00:32:40,187 --> 00:32:41,506
Cute, huh?

433
00:32:50,387 --> 00:32:51,900
Nice work, Po.

434
00:32:53,307 --> 00:32:55,821
At the first sign of trouble,
I will give you a signal.

435
00:32:57,307 --> 00:32:59,025
- You mean like Crane does?
- Yeah.

436
00:32:59,025 --> 00:33:01,462
Excuse me,
when have I ever made that noise?

437
00:33:02,267 --> 00:33:04,462
Master Ox. Master.

438
00:33:06,667 --> 00:33:08,020
The ferocious Master Croc.

439
00:33:09,907 --> 00:33:12,182
And Master Storming Ox.

440
00:33:13,187 --> 00:33:15,860
I can't believe we're rescuing
actual legends of kung fu.

441
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,938
We're going to free you from those
bonds of injustice. No problem.

442
00:33:17,938 --> 00:33:20,621
Got to be a key around here. No,
they wouldn't leave a key around here.

443
00:33:21,987 --> 00:33:24,706
Oh, good. You found it.
Come on, you guys. Yeah.

444
00:33:24,706 --> 00:33:26,778
We're coming for you, Shen.

445
00:33:32,147 --> 00:33:35,139
Guys, are we going or not?
Do you want to meet us there later?

446
00:33:35,139 --> 00:33:36,979
I mean, you do want to
take back your city, right?

447
00:33:36,979 --> 00:33:38,785
Of course we do.

448
00:33:38,785 --> 00:33:42,622
But if we stand up to Shen,
he will turn the weapon on the city.

449
00:33:42,622 --> 00:33:44,505
Listen to yourself.
You're protecting Gongmen City

450
00:33:44,505 --> 00:33:46,385
by not protecting Gongmen City?

451
00:33:46,385 --> 00:33:50,984
- If we all fight together...
- Then the weapon would kill everyone.

452
00:33:50,984 --> 00:33:54,742
Oh, would it?
Then we use... a sneak attack.

453
00:33:54,742 --> 00:33:57,375
- We get inside and then...
- And then you will be stopped...

454
00:34:00,347 --> 00:34:01,939
...by the unstoppable weapon.

455
00:34:01,939 --> 00:34:04,337
Nothing's unstoppable except for me
when I am stopping you

456
00:34:04,337 --> 00:34:06,896
from telling me something's unstoppable.

457
00:34:16,947 --> 00:34:19,586
Master Ox,
I am not letting you stay in this cell.

458
00:34:19,586 --> 00:34:21,544
I'd like to see you get me out.

459
00:34:26,907 --> 00:34:29,182
You guys see that?
It's called being awesome.

460
00:34:29,182 --> 00:34:31,144
Come on. Whatever happened to being heroes?

461
00:34:31,144 --> 00:34:33,946
The only hero in this town is a dead one.

462
00:34:38,347 --> 00:34:41,896
Like I said, you are not
getting me out of this cell.

463
00:34:44,547 --> 00:34:46,185
Yes.

464
00:34:46,185 --> 00:34:48,258
All right, let's go.

465
00:34:49,067 --> 00:34:50,261
I get the top bunk.

466
00:34:52,347 --> 00:34:56,340
It's time to surrender, panda.
Kung fu is dead.

467
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,940
I...

468
00:35:00,947 --> 00:35:01,982
You...

469
00:35:01,982 --> 00:35:05,184
Kung fu is dead? Fine.

470
00:35:05,184 --> 00:35:08,657
You stay in your prison of fear
with bars made of hopelessness.

471
00:35:08,657 --> 00:35:11,899
And all you get are three
square meals a day of shame.

472
00:35:11,899 --> 00:35:13,625
With despair for dessert.

473
00:35:13,625 --> 00:35:16,824
We will take on Shen and prove
to all those who are hungry

474
00:35:16,824 --> 00:35:20,741
for justice and honour
that kung fu still lives.

475
00:35:20,741 --> 00:35:22,226
Yeah.

476
00:35:25,227 --> 00:35:26,296
Monkey?

477
00:35:27,787 --> 00:35:29,061
You. You're mine.

478
00:35:29,061 --> 00:35:31,104
I will tell you what's going to be yours.

479
00:35:31,104 --> 00:35:34,065
My fist in your plush, cuddly,
super-soft face.

480
00:35:36,587 --> 00:35:37,940
Get him.

481
00:35:38,467 --> 00:35:40,105
- Get me out of here.
- Yes, sir.

482
00:35:40,907 --> 00:35:42,226
Stop him.

483
00:35:45,107 --> 00:35:46,335
Faster.

484
00:35:49,307 --> 00:35:51,696
Yeah. Go, go.

485
00:35:52,307 --> 00:35:54,263
- Lose him.
- Yes, sir.

486
00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:58,098
- Viper.
- Hang on.

487
00:36:07,147 --> 00:36:09,786
- What?
- Watch out.

488
00:36:12,267 --> 00:36:14,258
Uncool. Very uncool.

489
00:36:14,627 --> 00:36:16,265
Try this.

490
00:36:17,467 --> 00:36:18,582
Guys, guys, guys.

491
00:36:23,627 --> 00:36:25,140
Maybe something smaller.

492
00:36:25,667 --> 00:36:28,703
No, no. Oh, no, no.

493
00:36:32,067 --> 00:36:34,706
Cute bunnies, off the face.
Excuse me. OK, pardon me.

494
00:36:43,947 --> 00:36:45,585
Fire.

495
00:36:46,227 --> 00:36:47,706
We have lost them.

496
00:36:56,347 --> 00:36:58,224
Again. Again.

497
00:36:59,307 --> 00:37:00,501
Crane, catch.

498
00:37:03,827 --> 00:37:04,816
Gotcha.

499
00:37:13,747 --> 00:37:15,658
Guys, guys, guys, guys, give me a shove.

500
00:37:16,387 --> 00:37:18,264
Mantis, now.

501
00:37:31,147 --> 00:37:34,822
Is that all you got? It feels like
I am fighting a big old fluffy cloud.

502
00:37:34,822 --> 00:37:37,137
Well, this cloud is about
to bring the thunder.

503
00:37:40,227 --> 00:37:41,296
Your turn.

504
00:37:43,347 --> 00:37:46,737
Why... are... there...
so... many... signs?

505
00:38:01,907 --> 00:38:04,137
Come here. Alaka-squasho.

506
00:38:05,387 --> 00:38:08,618
Yes. Taste the defeat.

507
00:38:08,618 --> 00:38:10,106
Let me tell you something.

508
00:38:10,106 --> 00:38:13,145
Next time you mess with a panda,
you better bring a whole a...

509
00:38:22,547 --> 00:38:24,265
Guess nobody told you,

510
00:38:24,265 --> 00:38:27,225
if you mess with the wolf,
you get the fangs.

511
00:38:27,707 --> 00:38:31,416
I have hit you twice.
What are you going to do now?

512
00:38:34,227 --> 00:38:36,058
We surrender.

513
00:38:39,467 --> 00:38:43,506
You can chain my body, but you will
never chain my... warrior spirit.

514
00:38:43,506 --> 00:38:46,056
- Hey, don't forget the little guy.
- Did you just call...?

515
00:38:46,056 --> 00:38:49,264
- Po, what are you doing?
- Trust me. I got a pl...

516
00:38:50,747 --> 00:38:53,625
No way. Eight-point acupressure cuffs?

517
00:38:53,625 --> 00:38:56,904
Just like the ones that held Tai Lung.
The more you move, the tighter they get.

518
00:38:57,627 --> 00:38:59,697
These are the best cuffs.

519
00:39:02,107 --> 00:39:04,667
Greetings, panda. At last we meet.

520
00:39:05,987 --> 00:39:07,739
No, no, no...

521
00:39:10,907 --> 00:39:14,741
We meet at last. Yes, that's it.

522
00:39:14,741 --> 00:39:17,996
Greetings, panda. We meet at...

523
00:39:18,747 --> 00:39:22,342
- You are afraid for a reason.
- I am not afraid.

524
00:39:22,342 --> 00:39:25,146
He is coming to me in chains.

525
00:39:25,146 --> 00:39:27,696
- If anyone should be afraid, it's...
- You.

526
00:39:30,827 --> 00:39:32,977
Don't even think about it.

527
00:39:45,787 --> 00:39:48,426
I hope this turns out better than
your plan to cook rice in your stomach

528
00:39:48,426 --> 00:39:50,817
by eating it raw
and then drinking boiling water.

529
00:39:50,817 --> 00:39:52,978
This plan's nothing like that plan.

530
00:39:52,978 --> 00:39:55,183
- How?
- Because this one's going to work.

531
00:40:07,227 --> 00:40:09,138
Keep moving.

532
00:40:14,587 --> 00:40:17,055
Ah, my old enemy...

533
00:40:21,387 --> 00:40:23,378
...stairs.

534
00:40:50,547 --> 00:40:53,619
Thanks for carrying me
those last few flights. OK.

535
00:40:53,619 --> 00:40:56,096
I threw up a little bit
on the third floor.

536
00:40:56,096 --> 00:40:57,620
Someone might want to clean that up.

537
00:40:57,620 --> 00:41:00,347
Is there some sort of evil janitor
or something?

538
00:41:00,347 --> 00:41:02,020
Greetings, panda.

539
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:04,417
- We meet at...
- Hey, how you doing?

540
00:41:06,067 --> 00:41:07,420
Hey.

541
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:10,465
You have grown up bigger than I thought.

542
00:41:10,465 --> 00:41:13,221
Hey... enough with the poking around.

543
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:16,026
Strong. Healthy.

544
00:41:16,026 --> 00:41:18,747
Look, I don't know who you are,
but please stand aside, sir.

545
00:41:18,747 --> 00:41:21,262
- That's a lady.
- Oh. Sorry.

546
00:41:21,262 --> 00:41:24,021
The beard threw me.
It's kind of misleading.

547
00:41:24,021 --> 00:41:27,145
- False advertising.
- Enough of this nonsense.

548
00:41:27,145 --> 00:41:28,899
Bring the prisoners to me.

549
00:41:28,899 --> 00:41:30,625
Sorry, ma'am. Get ready, guys.

550
00:41:30,625 --> 00:41:33,221
Keep your eyes peeled for the... weapon.

551
00:41:37,467 --> 00:41:38,616
Sparrow kick.

552
00:41:40,587 --> 00:41:43,624
We did it. I just kung fu-ed it.
Did you guys see that? I was all like...

553
00:41:52,427 --> 00:41:55,544
Do you actually believe this is
the warrior destined to defeat me?

554
00:41:55,544 --> 00:41:58,744
I do not. I know he is.

555
00:41:59,987 --> 00:42:03,297
Oh, look at him.
A lifetime to plot his revenge

556
00:42:03,297 --> 00:42:06,823
- and he comes to me on his knees.
- What? A lifetime?

557
00:42:06,823 --> 00:42:08,181
I did not have a lifetime.

558
00:42:08,181 --> 00:42:10,224
We only heard about Master Rhino
a few days ago,

559
00:42:10,224 --> 00:42:14,903
- and we came to avenge him.
- You have come to avenge nothing else?

560
00:42:14,903 --> 00:42:17,456
Well, yeah.
All the pots and pans that you stole.

561
00:42:17,456 --> 00:42:19,936
- I am going to want those back.
- Nothing else?

562
00:42:19,936 --> 00:42:22,575
You probably did some other evil stuff
along the way. I don't know.

563
00:42:22,575 --> 00:42:24,783
- What else did you do?
- You don't know?

564
00:42:24,783 --> 00:42:27,097
Know what? What's so funny?

565
00:42:27,097 --> 00:42:30,259
The very thing that you clearly do not know.

566
00:42:30,259 --> 00:42:34,181
OK, enough of these riddles.
Would you guys spill the beans?

567
00:42:34,181 --> 00:42:37,544
First, we come in and the weapon
is tiny. Surprise, it's big.

568
00:42:37,544 --> 00:42:41,585
And then the lady over here,
I think it's a guy, because he's got...

569
00:42:41,867 --> 00:42:44,301
The only reason you are still alive

570
00:42:44,301 --> 00:42:49,063
is that I find your stupidity mildly amusing.

571
00:42:49,063 --> 00:42:52,424
Well, thank you. But I find your
evilness extremely annoying.

572
00:42:52,424 --> 00:42:54,384
Who do you think you are, panda?

573
00:42:54,384 --> 00:42:57,141
Who do you think I am, peacock?

574
00:43:05,387 --> 00:43:07,457
Why are we laughing?

575
00:43:08,467 --> 00:43:09,582
Take aim.

576
00:43:20,787 --> 00:43:22,140
Fire.

577
00:43:26,107 --> 00:43:28,701
Well, light the... thing.

578
00:43:28,701 --> 00:43:30,425
I did.

579
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:36,784
Fear the bug.

580
00:43:45,467 --> 00:43:46,866
Get the weapon.

581
00:43:48,787 --> 00:43:50,584
Tigress.

582
00:44:22,067 --> 00:44:23,420
You... You were there.

583
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:26,420
Yes. Yes, I was.

584
00:44:33,947 --> 00:44:36,984
- You just let Shen get away.
- At least we destroyed the weapon.

585
00:44:41,427 --> 00:44:42,780
Fire.

586
00:44:45,627 --> 00:44:47,379
Oh. No, he's got way more.

587
00:44:53,467 --> 00:44:54,786
- My wing.
- Help, Po.

588
00:44:54,786 --> 00:44:56,300
Coming.

589
00:44:57,147 --> 00:44:59,456
- Watch out.
- Po.

590
00:45:02,627 --> 00:45:05,380
- Help me up.
- No. Get him down.

591
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:07,026
Use the ropes.

592
00:45:15,547 --> 00:45:17,538
Run, run, little panda.

593
00:45:28,347 --> 00:45:31,305
- Po, come on. We need you to focus.
- I got it, I got it.

594
00:45:31,305 --> 00:45:33,025
Bring it down.

595
00:45:36,347 --> 00:45:38,542
- We're trapped.
- This way.

596
00:45:42,747 --> 00:45:44,180
Goodbye.

597
00:45:47,107 --> 00:45:48,381
Fire.

598
00:45:49,787 --> 00:45:51,140
Get back.

599
00:45:58,867 --> 00:46:00,778
The only way out is up.

600
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:02,820
What?

601
00:46:13,387 --> 00:46:15,742
Follow me. Come on.

602
00:46:16,307 --> 00:46:17,581
Where are they going?

603
00:46:17,581 --> 00:46:20,466
- To the top.
- Come on. Keep going.

604
00:46:27,427 --> 00:46:28,906
Here we go.

605
00:46:46,827 --> 00:46:50,024
- You idiot.
- My nose.

606
00:46:50,024 --> 00:46:54,419
Call in the wolves. All of them.
I want them ready to move.

607
00:46:54,419 --> 00:46:58,057
The Year of the Peacock begins now.

608
00:46:58,057 --> 00:47:00,980
Right now?
Because it's the middle of the year,

609
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:03,707
so you'd only get like
a half of the Year of the Peacock.

610
00:47:05,427 --> 00:47:08,419
And this is the Year, of course,
of the Peacock.

611
00:47:08,419 --> 00:47:10,498
Happy New Year, sir.

612
00:47:14,187 --> 00:47:18,260
Get the wolves ready.
We're loading the ships now.

613
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:19,462
Now.

614
00:47:19,462 --> 00:47:21,458
Now, now, now, now, now.

615
00:47:21,458 --> 00:47:24,300
Move. Move, move, move, move.

616
00:47:40,027 --> 00:47:41,585
This way.

617
00:47:45,787 --> 00:47:47,539
Let's go.

618
00:47:52,667 --> 00:47:53,543
Oh, you.

619
00:47:53,867 --> 00:47:55,858
What did you do? It's chaos up there.

620
00:47:55,858 --> 00:47:57,619
What happened to stopping Shen?

621
00:47:59,027 --> 00:48:00,585
Yeah.

622
00:48:01,947 --> 00:48:04,017
Guys, come on.
Give me a little credit.

623
00:48:04,017 --> 00:48:06,223
I meant for him to get away.

624
00:48:06,223 --> 00:48:09,220
Because... it was a trick. It was a plot.

625
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:14,097
I was thinking...
I will figure out his plot more.

626
00:48:14,747 --> 00:48:16,658
That makes no sense.

627
00:48:16,658 --> 00:48:18,419
What do you mean? Sure it does.

628
00:48:18,419 --> 00:48:21,784
Po, the truth.
You had Shen. What happened?

629
00:48:21,784 --> 00:48:23,903
What are you talking about?
I don't know what you're talking about.

630
00:48:23,903 --> 00:48:26,501
I... Yeah...
OK, he caught me off guard.

631
00:48:27,187 --> 00:48:28,381
The truth.

632
00:48:31,627 --> 00:48:35,222
Fine. They will keep you far from danger.

633
00:48:35,222 --> 00:48:37,821
- Real far.
- What?

634
00:48:37,821 --> 00:48:40,023
You're staying here.

635
00:48:40,507 --> 00:48:42,816
Wait. I have to go ba...

636
00:48:47,987 --> 00:48:49,739
You're staying here.

637
00:48:50,267 --> 00:48:52,337
I am going. And you can't stop me.

638
00:48:55,507 --> 00:48:57,657
OK. I wasn't ready that time.

639
00:48:57,657 --> 00:48:59,465
Guys? Don't.

640
00:48:59,465 --> 00:49:00,662
Ready.

641
00:49:01,267 --> 00:49:02,256
Look.

642
00:49:14,307 --> 00:49:15,626
Stay down.

643
00:49:17,187 --> 00:49:20,145
- I have to get to him.
- Then tell me why.

644
00:49:22,427 --> 00:49:24,657
He was there. OK?

645
00:49:24,657 --> 00:49:27,899
The peacock was there
the last time I saw my parents.

646
00:49:27,899 --> 00:49:31,537
He knows what happened.
Where I came from.

647
00:49:31,537 --> 00:49:34,062
Who I am.

648
00:49:37,467 --> 00:49:39,503
Look, I am going.

649
00:49:40,107 --> 00:49:42,416
I have to know.

650
00:49:42,416 --> 00:49:44,543
The hard core can't understand.

651
00:49:44,543 --> 00:49:46,345
Tigress, no.

652
00:49:50,347 --> 00:49:52,258
The hard core do understand.

653
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:56,421
But I can't watch my friend be killed.

654
00:49:57,787 --> 00:50:01,700
- We're going.
- Maybe you can't watch me be killed?

655
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:04,665
- Stop being a wimp.
- And she's back.

656
00:50:06,267 --> 00:50:08,337
- No.
- Don't worry, kid.

657
00:50:08,337 --> 00:50:10,225
You're better off here.

658
00:50:19,387 --> 00:50:23,699
You were wrong, Soothsayer.
We sail to victory tonight.

659
00:50:24,507 --> 00:50:26,737
Your magic panda is clearly a fool.

660
00:50:26,737 --> 00:50:29,740
Are you certain it is the panda
who is a fool?

661
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:32,182
You just destroyed
your ancestral home, Shen.

662
00:50:32,182 --> 00:50:37,467
A trivial sacrifice...
when all of China is my reward.

663
00:50:37,467 --> 00:50:39,982
Then will you finally be satisfied?

664
00:50:39,982 --> 00:50:44,186
Will the subjugation of the whole world
finally make you feel better?

665
00:50:44,707 --> 00:50:48,541
It's a start. I might also convert
the basement into a dungeon.

666
00:50:51,347 --> 00:50:53,941
The cup you choose to fill has no bottom.

667
00:50:53,941 --> 00:50:56,985
It is time to stop this madness.

668
00:50:57,987 --> 00:50:59,818
Why on earth would I do that?

669
00:50:59,818 --> 00:51:02,103
So your parents can rest in peace.

670
00:51:02,907 --> 00:51:05,740
My parents hated me.

671
00:51:06,907 --> 00:51:09,660
Do you understand?

672
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:14,981
They wronged me...
and I will make it right.

673
00:51:14,981 --> 00:51:16,375
They loved you.

674
00:51:16,375 --> 00:51:21,098
They loved you so much that
having to send you away killed them.

675
00:51:23,587 --> 00:51:29,139
The dead exist in the past...
and I must tend to the future.

676
00:51:33,787 --> 00:51:37,666
Set the soothsayer free.
She's no use to me.

677
00:51:37,666 --> 00:51:41,297
Goodbye, Shen. I wish you happiness.

678
00:51:41,297 --> 00:51:44,061
Happiness must be taken.

679
00:51:45,627 --> 00:51:47,902
And I will take mine.

680
00:52:08,907 --> 00:52:11,546
- Hurry it up.
- Move it.

681
00:52:12,627 --> 00:52:15,619
If all of those weapons
leave the building, China will fall.

682
00:52:15,619 --> 00:52:19,905
- We bring down the building.
- Hey, guys. How about this?

683
00:52:22,427 --> 00:52:24,497
- This will work.
- All right, let's go.

684
00:52:24,497 --> 00:52:26,100
I can't feel my face.

685
00:52:40,947 --> 00:52:43,780
Did you hear him call it
"Year of the Peacock"?

686
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:46,097
- Hey.
- Hey.

687
00:52:46,097 --> 00:52:47,746
OK. So, keep it cool.
Keep it cool. Keep it cool.

688
00:52:47,746 --> 00:52:50,216
You. Where are you going?

689
00:52:52,227 --> 00:52:55,537
On your feet. And wipe those
stupid grins off your faces.

690
00:53:08,427 --> 00:53:12,056
Move, you dogs.
Faster, faster. Load them all.

691
00:53:21,947 --> 00:53:23,858
Greetings, panda.

692
00:53:27,307 --> 00:53:30,185
- Tell me what happened that night.
- What night?

693
00:53:30,185 --> 00:53:33,225
- That night.
- Ah, that night.

694
00:53:33,225 --> 00:53:36,265
Yes. We're talking
about the same night, right?

695
00:53:37,147 --> 00:53:40,776
Yes, I was there. Yes. I watched
as your parents abandoned you.

696
00:53:40,776 --> 00:53:45,338
It's a terrible thing.
I believe it went something like this.

697
00:53:55,067 --> 00:53:56,466
Here's your New Year's gift.

698
00:53:56,466 --> 00:53:58,697
Hope you like it,
because you can't return it.

699
00:54:00,507 --> 00:54:02,782
Po? What's he doing here?

700
00:54:03,667 --> 00:54:04,861
Return it. Return it.

701
00:54:16,427 --> 00:54:18,861
Are you willing to die to find the truth?

702
00:54:18,861 --> 00:54:22,463
You bet I am.
Although I'd prefer not to.

703
00:54:44,307 --> 00:54:45,945
We got them. Go.

704
00:55:06,787 --> 00:55:08,220
You looking for me?

705
00:55:14,947 --> 00:55:16,665
I said that too soon, didn't I?

706
00:55:24,747 --> 00:55:25,862
Po.

707
00:55:30,427 --> 00:55:31,906
Po, get away from him.

708
00:55:31,906 --> 00:55:33,944
I will get up. Here we go.

709
00:55:36,627 --> 00:55:39,187
- No more running, Shen.
- So it seems.

710
00:55:39,187 --> 00:55:41,258
Now... answers.

711
00:55:41,258 --> 00:55:44,066
Oh, you want to know so badly.

712
00:55:44,667 --> 00:55:47,739
You think knowing will heal you, huh?

713
00:55:47,739 --> 00:55:51,786
Fill some crater in your soul?

714
00:55:51,786 --> 00:55:54,017
Well, here's your answer.

715
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:57,145
Your parents didn't love you.

716
00:55:58,147 --> 00:55:59,944
But here...

717
00:55:59,944 --> 00:56:02,667
...let me heal you.

718
00:56:08,427 --> 00:56:09,177
No.

719
00:57:21,667 --> 00:57:24,056
Yeah, like you could make me drink that.

720
00:57:28,147 --> 00:57:32,220
If I wanted you dead,
I would have left you in that river.

721
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:36,175
- Well, why save me?
- So you can fulfil your destiny.

722
00:57:36,175 --> 00:57:39,419
What are you talking about?
Where am I?

723
00:57:41,627 --> 00:57:43,106
What is this place?

724
00:57:43,106 --> 00:57:47,101
I am surprised you remember so little.

725
00:57:47,101 --> 00:57:50,577
But you were so little when it happened.

726
00:57:55,667 --> 00:57:58,101
Perhaps you do remember.

727
00:57:58,101 --> 00:58:00,178
What? It's just a stupid nightmare.

728
00:58:00,178 --> 00:58:02,338
Nightmare? Or memory?

729
00:58:32,027 --> 00:58:34,541
This was a thriving village.

730
00:58:34,541 --> 00:58:38,097
Young Shen was in line to rule Gongmen City.

731
00:58:38,097 --> 00:58:40,019
But he wanted more.

732
00:58:40,019 --> 00:58:45,705
I foretold that someone would stand
in his way. A panda.

733
00:58:45,705 --> 00:58:49,655
But I never could have foretold
what came next.

734
00:59:02,307 --> 00:59:03,660
Get them all.

735
00:59:10,147 --> 00:59:13,298
Take our son and run away. Go.

736
00:59:26,307 --> 00:59:29,777
Stop fighting. Let it flow.

737
01:01:28,627 --> 01:01:32,540
Your story may not have
such a happy beginning,

738
01:01:32,540 --> 01:01:35,699
but that doesn't make you who you are.

739
01:01:35,699 --> 01:01:38,301
It is the rest of your story.

740
01:01:39,107 --> 01:01:41,177
Who you choose to be.

741
01:02:12,027 --> 01:02:15,258
So, who are you, panda?

742
01:02:23,187 --> 01:02:24,540
I am Po.

743
01:02:26,267 --> 01:02:28,144
And I am going to need a hat.

744
01:02:37,187 --> 01:02:40,020
Such sad, sad faces.

745
01:02:40,587 --> 01:02:42,782
But now is a time only for joy.

746
01:02:42,782 --> 01:02:46,826
You are going to be part
of something beautiful.

747
01:02:48,987 --> 01:02:52,821
Once we reach the harbour,
in front of all the world,

748
01:02:52,821 --> 01:02:56,980
you and your precious kung fu will die.

749
01:02:59,067 --> 01:03:03,777
Then China will know to bow before me.

750
01:03:03,777 --> 01:03:05,539
Set sail.

751
01:03:16,347 --> 01:03:17,700
What is that?

752
01:03:37,347 --> 01:03:40,384
Honestly, guys,
I never thought I'd die like this.

753
01:03:40,384 --> 01:03:43,425
I always thought I'd meet
a nice girl and settle down and...

754
01:03:43,425 --> 01:03:45,259
...then she'd eat my head.

755
01:03:45,259 --> 01:03:47,736
- So sad.
- We cannot give up hope.

756
01:03:47,736 --> 01:03:52,264
Po would want us to remain strong.
Hard-core. Right, Tigress?

757
01:03:59,907 --> 01:04:03,695
- Lord Shen, what about the bridge?
- Nothing stands in my way.

758
01:04:04,387 --> 01:04:05,536
Fire.

759
01:04:14,427 --> 01:04:16,179
You coward.

760
01:04:25,707 --> 01:04:26,742
Po?

761
01:04:29,067 --> 01:04:30,056
Po?

762
01:04:32,067 --> 01:04:36,982
How many times do I have to kill
the same stinking panda?

763
01:04:46,187 --> 01:04:47,540
Shen.

764
01:04:47,540 --> 01:04:51,586
A panda stands between you and your destiny.

765
01:04:52,267 --> 01:04:53,256
What?

766
01:04:53,256 --> 01:04:57,261
Prepare yourself for a
hot serving of justice.

767
01:04:57,261 --> 01:04:59,019
Your reign of terror comes to an end.

768
01:04:59,019 --> 01:05:02,304
- What?
- And now, free the Five.

769
01:05:02,304 --> 01:05:04,458
Disc of Destruction.

770
01:05:15,107 --> 01:05:17,905
OK. Take aim.

771
01:05:28,747 --> 01:05:30,305
Ready?

772
01:05:50,387 --> 01:05:52,264
You can't follow me.

773
01:05:52,264 --> 01:05:53,462
Just get him.

774
01:05:58,547 --> 01:06:00,219
- Yeah. Here we go.
- Come on.

775
01:06:07,187 --> 01:06:08,506
- No, no, no, don't shoot.
- Don't shoot.

776
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:09,656
No, don't shoot.

777
01:06:09,656 --> 01:06:12,136
- Don't shoot.
- Don't shoot.

778
01:06:12,136 --> 01:06:14,616
- You don't shoot.
- I won't shoot if you won't shoot.

779
01:06:16,907 --> 01:06:17,896
Yeah.

780
01:06:17,896 --> 01:06:20,820
- Don't shoot. Cross fire.
- Attack.

781
01:06:26,747 --> 01:06:29,102
- Catch of Freedom.
- Monkey.

782
01:06:34,227 --> 01:06:36,343
Impressive, Dragon Warrior.
What's your plan?

783
01:06:36,343 --> 01:06:38,577
- Step one, free the Five.
- What's step two?

784
01:06:38,577 --> 01:06:40,419
Honestly, I didn't think
I'd make it this far.

785
01:06:40,419 --> 01:06:41,576
Po.

786
01:06:41,576 --> 01:06:43,783
Stop Shen before he gets to the harbour.

787
01:06:49,107 --> 01:06:50,096
Nice.

788
01:06:52,587 --> 01:06:53,861
Viper, Puppet of Death.

789
01:06:54,547 --> 01:06:55,536
Tigress.

790
01:07:03,867 --> 01:07:05,778
- Master Ox.
- Jump.

791
01:07:05,778 --> 01:07:08,336
- And Croc.
- Vengeance is served.

792
01:07:08,336 --> 01:07:11,226
- Why did you...?
- Your friend there is very persuasive.

793
01:07:18,547 --> 01:07:19,696
Master Shifu.

794
01:07:21,947 --> 01:07:24,177
Quickly. Use their boats to block the way.

795
01:07:34,547 --> 01:07:35,536
Crane.

796
01:07:36,467 --> 01:07:38,298
Wings of Justice.

797
01:07:40,307 --> 01:07:41,456
Yeah.

798
01:07:47,347 --> 01:07:48,336
What?

799
01:07:57,947 --> 01:08:01,860
I love you guys.

800
01:08:10,427 --> 01:08:12,019
Why aren't we firing?

801
01:08:12,019 --> 01:08:15,463
They're taking out our gunners, sir.
They're getting close.

802
01:08:17,187 --> 01:08:20,020
Fire. Fire at them.

803
01:08:20,667 --> 01:08:24,103
- But, sir, we will kill our own.
- I said fire at them.

804
01:08:24,103 --> 01:08:25,256
Fire.

805
01:08:27,787 --> 01:08:28,776
No.

806
01:08:36,107 --> 01:08:37,335
Po.

807
01:09:11,467 --> 01:09:12,536
Tigress?

808
01:10:00,347 --> 01:10:01,985
As you wish.

809
01:10:01,985 --> 01:10:03,705
Let's finish this.

810
01:10:26,427 --> 01:10:27,576
Fire.

811
01:10:32,427 --> 01:10:34,179
Inner peace.

812
01:11:00,507 --> 01:11:01,496
Again.

813
01:11:08,507 --> 01:11:09,496
Yeah.

814
01:11:10,747 --> 01:11:13,580
Kill him. Somebody kill him.

815
01:11:34,867 --> 01:11:37,176
What? No. No.

816
01:11:43,547 --> 01:11:46,425
Keep firing. Keep firing.

817
01:12:06,227 --> 01:12:07,660
Skadoosh.

818
01:12:36,667 --> 01:12:37,941
How did you...?

819
01:12:39,307 --> 01:12:40,865
How did you do it?

820
01:12:44,547 --> 01:12:47,061
You know, you just keep your elbows up
and keep the shoulders loose.

821
01:12:47,061 --> 01:12:50,264
Not that. How did you find peace?

822
01:12:50,264 --> 01:12:53,942
I took away your parents. Everything.

823
01:12:53,942 --> 01:12:56,382
I scarred you for life.

824
01:12:56,987 --> 01:13:00,343
See, that's the thing, Shen. Scars heal.

825
01:13:00,343 --> 01:13:04,341
No, they don't. Wounds heal.

826
01:13:04,341 --> 01:13:06,816
Oh, yeah. What do scars do?
They fade, I guess?

827
01:13:06,816 --> 01:13:11,219
- I don't care what scars do.
- You should, Shen.

828
01:13:11,219 --> 01:13:15,141
You got to let go of that stuff from
the past, because it just doesn't matter.

829
01:13:15,141 --> 01:13:19,619
The only thing that matters
is what you choose to be now.

830
01:13:19,619 --> 01:13:21,140
You're right.

831
01:13:21,140 --> 01:13:23,582
Then I choose... this.

832
01:14:14,227 --> 01:14:16,343
That was pretty hard-core.

833
01:14:25,307 --> 01:14:26,342
- Po.
- You did it.

834
01:14:26,342 --> 01:14:29,465
- Come here. Yeah.
- Don't ever do that again, please.

835
01:14:29,465 --> 01:14:33,142
It seems you have found inner peace.

836
01:14:33,142 --> 01:14:35,537
And at such a young age.

837
01:14:35,537 --> 01:14:37,504
Well, I had a pretty good teacher.

838
01:14:57,627 --> 01:15:01,142
What do you mean he's not here?
It's my son's birthday.

839
01:15:01,142 --> 01:15:03,582
All he wanted was to meet
the Dragon Warrior.

840
01:15:03,582 --> 01:15:06,386
How about some tofu birthday cake
instead, huh?

841
01:15:06,386 --> 01:15:09,266
You know, I think we will
just try again another time.

842
01:15:09,266 --> 01:15:10,746
When do you think he will be back?

843
01:15:13,587 --> 01:15:17,421
I don't know. OK, I don't know.
Maybe never.

844
01:15:17,421 --> 01:15:20,784
I mean, I worry, OK?
But that's my job, I am his dad.

845
01:15:20,784 --> 01:15:23,063
At least, I was his dad.

846
01:15:23,063 --> 01:15:26,697
Why did he have to go and save China?
I know why.

847
01:15:26,697 --> 01:15:30,416
But why? He's just one little panda.

848
01:15:45,307 --> 01:15:48,936
So, how did it go? Did you save China?

849
01:15:49,907 --> 01:15:51,226
Yep.

850
01:15:51,226 --> 01:15:53,582
Well, I knew you would.

851
01:15:53,582 --> 01:15:55,419
That's why I had new signs made.

852
01:15:55,419 --> 01:15:57,737
"My son saved China. You, too, can save.

853
01:15:57,737 --> 01:16:00,296
Buy one dumpling, get one free."

854
01:16:00,296 --> 01:16:01,786
Hey, that's a pretty good deal.

855
01:16:01,786 --> 01:16:04,507
- Would you like to try one?
- Maybe later.

856
01:16:07,187 --> 01:16:09,178
There's something I should tell you.

857
01:16:11,867 --> 01:16:16,099
While I was gone,
I found the village where I was born.

858
01:16:17,747 --> 01:16:20,978
I found out how I ended up
in that radish basket.

859
01:16:20,978 --> 01:16:22,705
You did?

860
01:16:23,507 --> 01:16:27,261
- I know who I am.
- You do?

861
01:16:29,187 --> 01:16:30,745
I am your son.

862
01:16:36,627 --> 01:16:38,185
I love you, Dad.

863
01:16:39,187 --> 01:16:40,984
I love you, too, son.

864
01:16:44,867 --> 01:16:46,823
Delicious, fat radishes.

865
01:16:46,823 --> 01:16:49,023
You're probably hungry.
Let me make you something to eat.

866
01:16:49,023 --> 01:16:50,859
What are you talking about? I will cook.

867
01:16:50,859 --> 01:16:52,380
- No, no, I will cook.
- Dad.

868
01:16:52,380 --> 01:16:54,583
Well, it's the least I can do.
You saved China.

869
01:16:54,583 --> 01:16:56,942
No, it's the least I can do.
You raised me.

870
01:16:56,942 --> 01:16:58,096
- Po.
- Dad.

871
01:16:58,096 --> 01:16:59,666
- Po.
- OK.

872
01:16:59,666 --> 01:17:02,341
Let's both cook. Together.

873
01:17:02,341 --> 01:17:03,735
Together.

874
01:17:03,735 --> 01:17:05,420
No, I will cook.

875
01:17:38,907 --> 01:17:41,216
My son is alive.

876
01:18:41,187 --> 01:18:44,176
