1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,200
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:06,880
Everybody, raise your glasses
to the killer of Jeremiah Valeska.

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:10,960
- A lead on a guy selling RPGs.
- Get out of here, Barbara.

4
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,000
- Eduardo?
- Nice shot, right?

5
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,560
Tell me what you did!

6
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,520
I put a chip in your brain.

7
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,200
- Better talk, now.
- A contract came along.

8
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,600
A contract from who?

9
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,200
Walker wants Ed Nygma taken out now.

10
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,480
Walker was behind this?

11
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,280
She's been controlling
Nygma the whole time?

12
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,480
Ouch.

13
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,080
Stitches still sore, huh?

14
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,360
I told you I had to let Selina
thrust the knife

15
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,680
into my flesh at least once.

16
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,000
You know Jim Gordon.

17
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,840
You know this city.
Find him. And kill him.

18
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,840
Your chances of survival
are astronomically low, James.

19
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,320
Continuing to run is ill-advised.

20
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,440
{\an5}Hope you're well rested, Edward.

21
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,720
{\an5}We have a lot of work ahead of us.

22
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,840
{\an5}Edward?

23
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,720
{\an5}Edward, what is it?

24
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,760
{\an5}Is someone down there, boy?

25
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,400
{\an5}<i>Cash and jewels aplenty</i>

26
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,120
<i>Sparkle in the sky</i>

27
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,760
<i>Five and ten and 20</i>

28
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,920
{\an5}<i>Time to say bye-bye</i>

29
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,800
{\an5}Oh, pretty, pretty.

30
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,360
{\an5}I'll call you Charlotte.

31
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,320
{\an5}You're a handsome devil.
What's your name?

32
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,520
Oswald Cobblepot.

33
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,600
But I'm guessing you already
knew that.

34
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,480
Stop!

35
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,800
{\an5}Penguin. Didn't think
you'd miss a couple things.

36
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,480
{\an5}Couple things go missing
all the time.

37
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,600
{\an5}How did you know about this place?

38
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,120
{\an5}All of the thieves I used are dead.

39
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,200
Yep, yep.

40
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,480
{\an5}Was on a job.

41
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,280
Someone got there first.

42
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,840
Followed them back here.

43
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,480
{\an5}Saw you. Bang, bang.

44
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,120
Then you know what is in store.

45
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,960
I do hope whatever you came here
for was worth your life.

46
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,080
{\an5}- The Russifer Diamond.
- Not Russifer.

47
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,760
{\an5}Charlotte.

48
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,960
What's in your other hand?

49
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,120
Wait, how did you...

50
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,680
Bye-bye.

51
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,160
Who the hell was that?

52
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,160
Oh, God...

53
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,360
Oh, God.
It happened again, didn't it?

54
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,240
What did I do?

55
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,320
You tried to kill me.

56
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,960
Is that all?

57
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,040
I need answers, Ed.

58
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,040
I know Walker gave the orders
to destroy Haven

59
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,440
and the supply helicopter.

60
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,080
- What is she planning next?
- I don't know.

61
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,400
Jim, I don't remember anything
once I go under.

62
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,640
You're bleeding.

63
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,640
You have to let me go.
I'm not responsible for this.

64
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,240
That chip in your head
could be evidence.

65
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,880
So unless you want me to rip it out,

66
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,520
you're coming with me.

67
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,400
Okay.

68
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,880
Bruce.

69
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,960
There you are.

70
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,360
So, go on, then.

71
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,880
How'd it go with Selina?

72
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,200
Oh, dear.

73
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,800
Well, I am sorry, Master Bruce,
but perhaps it's for the best.

74
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,280
Maybe.

75
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,200
That's not why I called you here.
You see this?

76
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,560
Yeah, I know, right?

77
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,560
Looks like Captain Gordon's
finally getting the help

78
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,080
this city so desperately needs.

79
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,680
Is he?

80
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,320
What the people desperately need
is food and medicine.

81
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,520
Not just more guns.

82
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,760
What is it?

83
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,840
No, it's just this unit.
Their motto is "Born of Blood."

84
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,200
You know them?

85
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,960
Yeah, by reputation only.
They're a horrible bunch of bastards.

86
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,440
They specialize in military coups,
assassinations.

87
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,000
They're certainly not the vanguard
for humanitarian relief.

88
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,280
Excuse me.

89
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,760
When's the supply shipment
gonna be here?

90
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,920
- Supplies?
- These people are desperate

91
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,640
for food, clean water, medicine.

92
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,520
Oh, yeah. It's on its way.

93
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,400
Where's Captain Gordon?

94
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,720
We lost sight of Gordon.

95
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,560
But don't worry. Eduardo's
out there looking for him right now.

96
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,520
Unless you know
where we might find him?

97
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,200
Logically, he'd come here.

98
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,320
Unless there's some reason he can't.

99
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,320
Tell you what, kiddo.

100
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,040
I'm gonna find you and your
friend a quiet place in the back

101
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,120
where you can wait for Gordon.

102
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,640
Don't you worry about it, mate.
We'll just catch up with him later.

103
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,720
I insist.

104
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,080
We need to find Jim.

105
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,800
So the government is behind Haven
and the supply helicopter,

106
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,640
and they did it with a chip
in this one's head?

107
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,120
Is that really the craziest thing
you've ever heard, Barbara?

108
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,240
Bruce hit me up on the radio
a little while ago, looking for you.

109
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,000
Said things are amiss in the GCPD.

110
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,800
I'll reach out, see if we can meet up
somewhere safe.

111
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,400
Can you pull in some of your people,
see if they can help?

112
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,360
No. I need them guarding
my territory.

113
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,480
- But you have me.
- And me.

114
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,960
I don't trust you

115
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,560
with or without that chip
in your head.

116
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,720
Jim.

117
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,960
They used me as a pawn
to murder innocent people.

118
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,360
They messed with my brain.

119
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,800
The thing that I want is revenge.

120
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,920
How do I know
that chip can't be reactivated?

121
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,440
Well, when you found me
at Strange's lab,

122
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,320
he was fixing it after a...

123
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,080
car battery mishap.

124
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,600
It's safe to say
that I think you shorted it out.

125
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,880
Let me look at that.

126
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,400
- What?
- Your neck.

127
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,920
That's gonna need stitches.
I have a first aid kit.

128
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,680
I need to keep moving.
Just name your fee.

129
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,560
Can't I just want to help?

130
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,680
Not you, not usually.

131
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,160
Friend of mine just tried to kill me.

132
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,680
I don't want anyone else waiting
for an excuse to stab me in the back.

133
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,920
I gave you Gerry the Jerkwad,

134
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,560
and I'm letting you hide out
in my club.

135
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,280
If I wanted to betray you,
I would have done it earlier.

136
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,560
So, where's that first aid kit?

137
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,680
Gonna make myself useful.

138
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,280
What's it gonna take for you
to trust me?

139
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,840
After everything you've done,

140
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,080
I honestly don't know.

141
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,560
I'd listen to her, Jim.

142
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,600
I hear trust is in short supply.

143
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,680
You forget your PSYOPS training, Jim?

144
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,280
Lesson one:
When a person is in trouble,

145
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,400
they go to a familiar place.

146
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,600
Your ex-fiancée's bar
was just a stone's throw away, so

147
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,960
it's nice to finally meet you,
Barbara.

148
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,600
Screw you.

149
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,280
It seems you've lost your tail.

150
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,040
You mean the psychopath
you ordered to kill me?

151
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,560
You had your chance.

152
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,080
It could have been like old times,
buddy.

153
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,240
You, me, together

154
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,920
making the world a better place.

155
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,600
- By murdering civilians?
- Civilians?

156
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,080
This hellhole is infested
with criminals and terrorists.

157
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,600
Sometimes, you just have
to clean house, you know?

158
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,400
I won't let you.

159
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,920
It's not your call, Jim.

160
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,400
I'm not dead yet.

161
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,200
James Gordon,
I've been ordered to kill you.

162
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,480
Well, looks like
you haven't lost that tail after all.

163
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,920
If I die,

164
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,120
you'll never get the evidence!

165
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,960
Stand down.

166
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,880
I have evidence that you
and Walker are behind Haven.

167
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,480
If I die, it gets out
to the entire country.

168
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,840
It's time to make a deal.

169
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,560
You don't have any evidence.

170
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,880
Is that a risk you're willing
to take?

171
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,680
It is.

172
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,040
Nygma, kill them both.

173
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,200
Bad time?

174
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,000
What do you want?

175
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,440
Depends.

176
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,520
What did they want?

177
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,920
A shot at me.

178
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,480
I killed Jeremiah Valeska.

179
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,480
So, the rumors are true.

180
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,400
Yeah.

181
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,920
And now, every scumbag in town
wants to take me down

182
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,240
to make a name for themselves.

183
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,160
So, I got to find a new squat.

184
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:49,000
How about, in exchange
for helping me find someone,

185
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,000
I let you crash in my citadel?

186
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,000
It's seen better days, but...

187
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,280
- then again, right?
- Who?

188
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,520
A miscreant I caught
in the act of stealing from me.

189
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,600
She was going to replace the stolen
item with an exact replica,

190
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,040
except the replica was a bomb.

191
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,640
Ring any bells?

192
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,280
White hair, feathered collar,
kind of resembles a goth chicken?

193
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,360
You do know her.

194
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,040
She goes by the name Magpie.

195
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,600
What'd she steal?

196
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,600
The Russifer Diamond.

197
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,920
What makes you think I would help you

198
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,680
after you killed Tabitha
in cold blood?

199
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,760
Because you believe
in an eye for an eye.

200
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,040
Hard as it may be to swallow,

201
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,480
Tabitha made her bed
when she killed my mother.

202
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,640
Tell you what.

203
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,400
I will help you

204
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,520
if I get to keep the diamond.

205
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,400
What?

206
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,680
Not a chance.

207
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,000
Then you'll never find her.

208
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,480
And every person in Gotham
will think it's okay

209
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,920
to steal from Penguin.

210
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,520
Is that what you want?

211
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,800
You know me too well.

212
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,440
Fine.

213
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,640
Good.

214
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,720
- What happened?
- I want every soldier in the field

215
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,160
looking for Jim Gordon.

216
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,760
Sir, we maxed out the holding cells.

217
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,560
We may need to keep men here
to control the overflow.

218
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,120
Ethan, Sumiko.

219
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,280
We're moving to phase two.

220
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,000
What in the hell's going on?

221
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,960
Listen up.

222
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,880
I am not here to play nice.

223
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,480
I am not here to hold anyone's hand.

224
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,800
I am here on a simple mission.

225
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,120
Any questions about the nature
of that mission?

226
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,360
Are you insane?
You can't just execute people.

227
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,320
Do not question me.

228
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,280
This is the mission.
If you don't like it,

229
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,200
you'll be locked up.
You'll remain locked up

230
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:15,200
until we purge the criminal element
from the streets of Gotham.

231
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,040
Sir, Secretary Walker's on the radio.

232
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,120
We've moved on to phase two,

233
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,240
but we've lost track
of Gordon and Nygma.

234
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,960
I think Gordon found a way
to fry the chip.

235
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,200
<i>We can't have Nygma in the wind
with all that evidence in his head.</i>

236
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,400
Just trust me. Once we find them...

237
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,480
<i>Don't bother.</i>

238
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,240
<i>I have an idea that will bring
Jim Gordon and Nygma to us.</i>

239
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,360
Thanks for getting everyone here.

240
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,320
And for the Wayne R and D.

241
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,280
Are you sure about including
Barbara Kean and Ed Nygma?

242
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,080
War makes for strange bedfellows.

243
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,520
It's good to have
a friend nearby, Bruce.

244
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,040
Would you be careful?

245
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,120
If you'll stop moving,
this will go a lot faster.

246
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,720
Well, if you would be more careful,
I wouldn't potato

247
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,360
all the long legs
from the hidden spoon.

248
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,440
What just happened?

249
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,640
I believe the chip is installed
against his speech center.

250
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,320
Do it again.

251
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,160
The human brain
is not a plaything, Ms. Kean.

252
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,920
Please don't habituate
the curtain rod.

253
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,560
And...

254
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,440
Stay.

255
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,320
There. How does that feel?

256
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,760
Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers.

257
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,120
Oh, God. Thank you, Lucius.

258
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,400
So, what exactly are we looking for?

259
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,120
Anything tying Walker or Eduardo
to the destruction of Haven.

260
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,920
Why would Walker kill
all those people?

261
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,560
That's what we have to find out.

262
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,160
Oh, yes.

263
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,320
It appears the chip retains
an audio log

264
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,000
of every verbal communication
with Nygma while he was under.

265
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,800
There's some damage,

266
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,640
but if the command
to attack Haven is still here,

267
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,960
I can trace it back to the computer
from which it originated.

268
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,080
It has to be Walker.

269
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,960
They won't be able to sweep
this under the rug anymore.

270
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,200
Are you out there, Jim?

271
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,320
What do you want?

272
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,680
We have someone here...

273
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,280
who wants to say hello.

274
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,640
<i>Jim? What's happening?</i>

275
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,040
Lee?

276
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,920
We found the Queen of the Narrows

277
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,600
in a run-down hidey-hole
on the north side.

278
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:42,160
Tell me, how many ex-fiancées
do you have, anyway?

279
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,960
Leave her out of this.
She's not involved.

280
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,560
<i>But she's a criminal,
and all criminals in Gotham</i>

281
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,600
are now under a death sentence.

282
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,160
<i>But what happens next is up to you.</i>

283
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,680
A trade, perhaps.

284
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,120
Lee Thompkins for Ed Nygma.

285
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,400
Fine.

286
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,560
Good. Bring Nygma to the GCPD now.

287
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,640
No, we meet at Haven.

288
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,480
I want you to see
the carnage you've caused.

289
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,960
<i>Always so emotional.</i>

290
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,400
That's not how wars are won, Jim.

291
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,480
Those are my terms.
Take it or leave it.

292
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,440
Okay.

293
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,160
I'll play your game.

294
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,240
What are you doing?

295
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,520
He's never gonna
let you walk out of there.

296
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,720
I don't recall volunteering
as a trading chit!

297
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,960
He doesn't want Ed.
He wants the chip.

298
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,160
So I'll give him the chip.

299
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:37,440
Bruce, do you have any contacts
in the mainland press?

300
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,520
Several.

301
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,400
What would it take to broadcast
the information

302
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,720
from the chip to the mainland?

303
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,200
A transmitter, which I have,

304
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,440
and a very large antenna,
which I do not.

305
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,920
I know where there's an antenna
in the Green Zone,

306
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,160
but you're not gonna like it.

307
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,600
The roof of the GCPD.

308
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,920
Lee.

309
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,320
- Harvey.
- Where the hell have you been?

310
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,920
You've been gone for months.

311
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,120
I don't know.

312
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,040
I can't remember anything.

313
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,200
- What happened to me?
- I don't know.

314
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,400
We're gonna figure it out. I promise.

315
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,080
Let's go.

316
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,560
It's gonna be okay.

317
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,800
<i>Eduardo just arrived.</i>

318
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,640
<i>He brought backup, like we expected.</i>

319
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,920
<i>- Time to move.</i>
- Copy that.

320
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,320
Let's go.

321
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,600
Jim! Who are these people?

322
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,040
I'm gonna get you out of here, Lee.

323
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,800
I'm not sure that's true, Jim.

324
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,280
It seems you forgot to bring someone.

325
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,880
It's hard to make a swap
when you have nothing to trade.

326
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,760
We both know
this is really what you want.

327
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,320
Proof that you and Walker
are responsible

328
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,680
for the destruction of Haven

329
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,760
and the murder of hundreds
of innocent people.

330
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,880
Now, let her go.

331
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,760
Let me guess,

332
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,960
you made a copy so you can do
this little bit of theatrics for me.

333
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,560
I expected more from you, Jim.

334
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,880
Three soldiers against one man
without a gun.

335
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,680
You sure you brought enough help?

336
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,880
I don't need any help.

337
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,800
Is that why you sent Nygma
to do your dirty work?

338
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,000
So he could pick up
your slack like I used to?

339
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,320
Still dining out on pulling me
from that burning truck.

340
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,920
I carried more than my fair share.
I was always the first man in.

341
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,120
Your recklessness got people killed.

342
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,080
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

343
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,680
Ramirez?

344
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,120
- No.
- Johnson.

345
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,080
Bolton.

346
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,640
Their deaths were not on me.

347
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,040
Yeah.

348
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,920
Put a bullet in my mouth
and shut me up.

349
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,640
No.

350
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,440
Not a bullet.

351
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,640
But I am gonna shut your mouth.

352
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,160
Once and for all.

353
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,880
Come try.

354
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,320
- You sure this is the place?
- Yep.

355
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,840
This is the place.

356
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,960
Stop her!

357
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,120
Ouchie. You're quick.

358
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,200
I know you?

359
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,960
- Doubt it.
- Uh-huh.

360
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,920
You killed Jeremiah. You're famous.

361
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,320
Not so scary.

362
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,760
I could be famous.

363
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,040
You want a shot at me, too?

364
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,680
Unfortunately,
you won't have the opportunity.

365
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,960
Careful.

366
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,040
This is my workshop

367
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,360
where I make my boom-booms.

368
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,280
Anything here, boom, boom.

369
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,320
Then more boom and more boom,
then the whole room...

370
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,400
- Boom, boom. We get it.
- You're bluffing.

371
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,040
Catch.

372
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,440
No, no!

373
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,560
Whoops!

374
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,360
That watch must have been
an original,

375
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,400
but other stuff in there, boom, boom.

376
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,120
Good luck.

377
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,800
We tie our shoelaces together,
then we lasso the keys off the desk.

378
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,920
And then what, Roy Rogers, huh?
They surrender in awe?

379
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,520
No hare-brained scheme
is gonna get us out of here.

380
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,440
Hello!

381
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,400
Hope you don't mind, I...

382
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,720
borrowed some cop stuff
from the garage.

383
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,720
Oh, boy, you can put your guns down.

384
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,920
Kevlar in this thing
is designed to withstand a blast

385
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,160
that can tear down
a building twice this size.

386
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,880
What is that?

387
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,560
Is it not obvious?

388
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,960
It's a bomb!

389
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,920
Okay.

390
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,120
Let's play a game.

391
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,280
Clear out.

392
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,080
If anyone leaves this building,
this thing blows.

393
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:49,560
You gomers messed
with the wrong super genius,

394
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,800
and now it's time
for a little payback.

395
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,720
Nygma, you're a son of a bitch!

396
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,360
Oh, not now, Bullock.

397
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,640
The body count at Haven
wasn't big enough for you, huh?

398
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,720
Shut up!

399
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,080
What's your game?

400
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,800
The only way to deactivate this bomb

401
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,480
is to put a four-digit code
on the keypad there.

402
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,560
What's the code?

403
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,680
The pallid beach mouse
can give birth every four weeks.

404
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,160
Assuming we start with two mice,

405
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,240
and that the size
of an average litter is 12 mice,

406
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,760
and that they are equally
split male to female,

407
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,840
how many pallid beach mice

408
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:36,600
would we have at the end of one year?

409
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,760
The answer to that question
is the code.

410
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,920
Oh, I almost forgot.

411
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
You have two minutes.

412
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,400
After that, everyone in here
goes splat.

413
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,040
Except for me, of course.

414
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,560
I'm in position.

415
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,840
Copy. Plug the recorder
to the transmitter.

416
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,760
Next, you'll connect the transmitter
to the radio.

417
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,840
There should be a black box
at the base of the antenna.

418
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,240
Let me know when you get it open.

419
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,400
Nygma's bomb ploy won't last forever.

420
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,040
We just have to wait
for the exhaust fans to come

421
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,240
to a complete stop
before you can use the gas.

422
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,920
What are you doing?

423
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,960
You want to take responsibility
for people dying?

424
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,320
Look around.

425
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,000
This is all on you.

426
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,080
What the hell does that mean?

427
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,120
Walker spent months

428
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,760
trying to convince her superiors
that Gotham

429
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,120
was overrun by criminals.

430
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,680
We were this close to being sent in

431
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,640
when you set up Haven.

432
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,560
The fact that one man was able
to safely house and rescue

433
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,360
hundreds of innocent civilians
showed the military higher-ups

434
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,560
that the criminal element of Gotham

435
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,920
must not be so big
and scary after all.

436
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,520
They were ready to send in relief...

437
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,400
so it had to come down.

438
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,360
Why?

439
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
What the hell does she want?

440
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,360
They were innocent people, children.

441
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,960
They were an acceptable loss
for the mission.

442
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,840
What mission, damn it?

443
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,840
That's enough.

444
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:22,520
Take her out back and shoot her.

445
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,760
He doesn't need to see this.

446
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,840
It's my gift to you, a small mercy.

447
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,120
You never should have
brought her into this, Eduardo.

448
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,360
Can we speed things along,
please, Mr. Fox?

449
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,680
The exhaust fans have to wind down
before they can change directions.

450
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,920
If you throw the canisters in now,
the gas will blow outside.

451
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,680
Bruce, status?

452
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,800
One second.

453
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,160
I'm here. The box is open.

454
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,360
Two dark green wires right in front.

455
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,720
Attach those to the transmitter.
The message will send.

456
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,480
It's done.

457
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,040
One minute left.

458
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,600
Everybody hear that?

459
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,840
One minute
before this thing explodes.

460
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,440
I know the answer.

461
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,760
Nope. Don't think you do, Bullock.

462
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,760
My high school zoology class
is still rattling around up here.

463
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,440
High school was a long time ago,

464
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,040
so let's just take
the full minute, shall we?

465
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,920
- Really think about it.
- I don't need to.

466
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,800
The pallid beach mouse is extinct.

467
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,960
It disappeared in 1959.

468
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,560
The number you'll have
at the end of the year is zero.

469
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:18,720
The number is zero. Trust me on this.

470
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,760
I got in trouble.
I had to write an essay about it.

471
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:21,840
I swear to God.

472
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,360
Oh, dear.

473
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,080
I got a math problem for you.

474
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,320
Count these bullets.

475
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Yes!

476
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,480
You want to know
why Ramirez and the rest

477
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,560
didn't make it out?

478
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,200
After your tour of duty was up,

479
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:25,680
we were caught behind enemy lines,
taken to the darkest hell on Earth.

480
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,720
<i>Peña Duro.</i>

481
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,440
Have you heard of it?

482
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,520
Prison?

483
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,600
I didn't know.

484
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,640
No one did,

485
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,960
'cause it's where we were left
to die by our government.

486
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,080
I was the only one that survived.

487
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,120
Walker...

488
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,080
Walker, she found me in that place.
She pulled me out.

489
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,560
She gave me a new purpose.

490
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,960
She made you her killer.

491
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,480
No, no, Jim.

492
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,640
She's the killer.

493
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,040
And you have no idea.

494
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,960
Lee?

495
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,920
You and your stupid revenge.

496
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,040
The diamond isn't even worth
anything in Gotham anyway.

497
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,960
Unless...

498
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:52,680
The diamond is worth something
on the mainland.

499
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,680
And I bet, you have

500
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,240
way more where that came from.

501
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,920
You're leaving Gotham.

502
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,080
Congratulations, you're a genius.

503
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,520
Why?

504
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,000
"Alexander the Great

505
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,480
then looked upon his land

506
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,960
and wept.

507
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,720
For there was nothing left
to conquer."

508
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,680
I've done all I can in Gotham.

509
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,600
Some things twice.

510
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,760
There's nothing left
for me here anymore.

511
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,560
I want in.

512
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:45,000
I can't even walk around the city

513
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,520
without some lowlife
trying to take me out.

514
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,000
Just so he can up his cred.

515
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,600
I don't want to be the person
who killed Jeremiah Valeska.

516
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,400
I just want to be myself.

517
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,880
And I can't do that
in Gotham anymore.

518
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,000
My heart weeps for you.

519
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,400
But no.

520
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,120
What if I could get us out of here?

521
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,680
You do that, I will cut you in.

522
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,000
50-50.

523
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:21,680
Ten percent, and I won't murder you
once we reach the mainland.

524
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,760
Deal.

525
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,520
Selina, wait!

526
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:34,560
She said, anything in the room
could be a bomb.

527
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,000
Not the room itself.

528
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,880
- Did you know that the whole time?
- Just thought of it.

529
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:45,080
We should hurry before she gets away
with all our stuff.

530
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,160
Don't worry.

531
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,080
She won't get far.

532
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,880
Alvarez, take Lee to my office.

533
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:54,960
Be right there.

534
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,400
I got to be honest with you, man.

535
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,000
I don't know how many more
of these close calls

536
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,520
this old heart can take.

537
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,960
We were able to transmit
the audio logs,

538
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,400
but until I hear back
from my contacts,

539
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,840
I won't know if they received them.

540
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,840
Well, if they did,
probably have a lot of questions.

541
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,960
We'll spend the night and help out.

542
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,960
Alfred can go back to the apartment
and grab what you can?

543
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,040
Certainly, Master Bruce.

544
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,600
Thanks, Bruce.

545
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,840
The next time I get a short straw,
I'm just gonna walk into traffic.

546
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,080
Where has Lee been this whole time?

547
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,800
I don't know.

548
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,560
I'm not gonna wait around
to watch their touching reunion.

549
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,240
What is happening here?

550
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,400
I don't know where to start.

551
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,040
When I didn't hear from you...

552
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,880
I'd hoped you'd gotten
out of Gotham.

553
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,640
The last thing that I remember

554
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,760
is Jeremiah destroying the bridges.

555
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,240
That was over three months ago.

556
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,320
Three months?

557
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Oh, my God.

558
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,360
You don't remember anything?

559
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,200
I'm trying, and...

560
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,000
right before the bridges came down,

561
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,360
you said you were leaving the city.

562
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,280
- Why didn't you?
- I don't know, Jim.

563
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,920
None of this is making any sense.

564
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,800
We're still cut off.

565
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,400
There's no help.

566
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,880
It's been hard.

567
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,240
Actually, that's not true.

568
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
It's been hell.

569
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,360
People needed hope,
so I put on a brave face.

570
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,960
Pretended I knew what to do.

571
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,640
But you know me, Lee.

572
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,040
I'm just a cop.

573
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,240
And now I'm really lost.

574
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Hey, it's okay.

575
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,240
We're here now.

576
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,800
We'll just try to put
the pieces back together again.

577
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,120
Maybe we can help each other.

578
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,720
Let's start with my memory.

579
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,400
I went back to the Narrows.

580
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
I saw Ed.

581
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,960
We fought. We...

582
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,080
He stabbed me.

583
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,360
- What?
- Wait, let me remember.

584
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,440
I stabbed him.

585
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,920
There was so much blood.

586
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,640
Then I was...

587
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,840
somewhere.

588
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,360
A hospital, maybe?

589
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,720
Eduardo.

590
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:13,720
So much potential,
but not quite up to the task.

591
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:15,920
Walker.

592
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,200
How?

593
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,960
We've been burned.

594
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,400
The press have recordings of me
instructing Nygma to take down Haven.

595
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,360
I thought I might accomplish my task

596
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,560
without setting foot
in this foul city,

597
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,760
but that's not to be.

598
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,680
You won't die yet, my warrior.

599
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,760
There is so much more for you to do.

600
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,560
Professor Strange will have you
fixed up in no time.

601
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,280
Jim Gordon.

602
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,960
Don't worry about Gordon.

603
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,680
Nygma was never alone.

604
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,880
There was a second operative.

605
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,400
You okay?

606
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,480
You cold?

607
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,440
The hospitals were all
out of commission.

608
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,560
Just the one clinic
in the green zone.

609
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,320
- Lee?
- Time to die, Jim Gordon.

610
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,880
Wanted: one butler.

611
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,520
Military background a plus.

612
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,040
References required.

613
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,440
Yes, Mr. Pennyworth.

614
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,640
I have a job for you.

615
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,360
Well, you weren't lying when you said
she wouldn't get far.

616
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:13,120
Pretty crown's, booby-trapped.

617
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,160
Ouch.

618
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,120
Ouch, indeed.

619
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,960
I couldn't have you coming back here

620
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,520
and making off
with all of my belongings.

621
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,080
Our belongings.

622
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,400
Cut my wings, let me go?

623
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,200
Bang, bang.

624
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:36,800
What the hell? The buckshot in her
gut wasn't enough punishment?

625
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,120
Just a little reminder
of what happens

626
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,840
when people try to steal from me.

627
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,080
Good to know.

628
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,640
Partner.

629
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,160
So Lee has a chip, too?

630
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,520
I don't know how,
but it seems that way.

631
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,960
Walker must have been holding
onto her

632
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,960
as some sort of plan B
this whole time.

633
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,040
Three months?

634
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,640
That's a hell of a long game
she's playing.

635
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,840
Which means she probably
has other tricks up her sleeve.

636
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,760
Hey.

637
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,640
- Welcome back.
- Oh, hell.

638
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,080
This is gonna keep happening.

639
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:20,760
What's wrong with me?

640
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,480
The good news is,
I think I can actually answer that.

641
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,760
Jim.

642
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,960
I need to talk to you.

643
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,840
Now is not a good time, Barbara.

644
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,600
Don't you remember the good time
we had the other night?

645
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,040
- Over there?
- Say what?

646
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,640
You need to leave now.

647
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,560
I'm pregnant.

648
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,160
Good to see you, Lee.

649
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,280
Long time.

650
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,840
Congratulations?

651
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:08,840
You.

652
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,800
You're supposed to be dead, mate.

653
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,560
Sorry to disappoint.

654
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,760
You hurt my boy...

655
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,560
and I will bite your face off.

656
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,040
Yeah. Yeah.

657
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,000
Bruce will be along shortly.

658
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,160
In the meantime

659
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,600
this place is in desperate need

660
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,960
of some good,
old-fashioned butlering.

661
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,920
How did you even find a way off
the bloody island anyway?

662
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,600
How?

663
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,920
One if by land, two if by sea,

664
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:53,400
three if by digging a tunnel
under the river.

665
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,960
But enough questions.

666
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,040
Today is the big day.
