330
00:35:14,822 --> 00:35:17,700
You know the army of the dead
will be upon us soon.

331
00:35:18,618 --> 00:35:21,037
And you know I can help you win that war.

332
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,178
Ride south today.

333
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:40,723
If you return to the North,

334
00:35:40,806 --> 00:35:43,059
I'll have you hanged as a murderer.

335
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,788
If you ever come back this way,

336
00:36:03,871 --> 00:36:06,165
I will execute you myself.

337
00:36:38,572 --> 00:36:41,117
I'm having the lord's chamber
prepared for you.

338
00:36:42,785 --> 00:36:44,620
Mother and Father's room?

339
00:36:46,372 --> 00:36:47,957
You should take it.

340
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:51,335
I'm not a Stark.

341
00:36:52,378 --> 00:36:53,963
You are to me.

342
00:36:58,217 --> 00:36:59,510
You're the Lady of Winterfell.

343
00:36:59,593 --> 00:37:01,637
You deserve it.
We're standing here because of you.

344
00:37:03,472 --> 00:37:06,934
The battle was lost
until the Knights of the Vale rode in.

345
00:37:07,017 --> 00:37:08,728
They came because of you.

346
00:37:13,315 --> 00:37:16,318
You told me Lord Baelish
sold you to the Boltons.

347
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,070
- He did.
- And you trust him?

348
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:21,824
Only a fool would trust Littlefinger.

349
00:37:25,077 --> 00:37:27,121
I should have told you about him,

350
00:37:27,997 --> 00:37:30,291
about the Knights of the Vale.

351
00:37:31,584 --> 00:37:33,002
I'm sorry.

352
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,973
We need to trust each other.

353
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:49,560
We can't fight a war amongst ourselves.

354
00:37:49,643 --> 00:37:52,229
We have so many enemies now.

355
00:38:08,204 --> 00:38:09,246
Jon.

356
00:38:10,206 --> 00:38:12,541
A raven came from the Citadel.

357
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:15,169
A white raven.

358
00:38:17,213 --> 00:38:18,380
<i>(SIGHS)</i>

359
00:38:18,464 --> 00:38:19,590
Winter is here.

360
00:38:32,228 --> 00:38:34,980
Well, Father always promised, didn't he?

361
00:38:49,578 --> 00:38:54,041
OLENNA: The last time a Tyrell
came to Dorne, he was assassinated.

362
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:57,461
A hundred red scorpions, was it?

363
00:38:57,586 --> 00:39:00,130
ELLARIA: You have nothing to fear
from us, Lady Olenna.

364
00:39:00,214 --> 00:39:04,009
OLENNA: You murder your own prince,
but you expect me to trust you?

365
00:39:04,093 --> 00:39:07,179
We invited you to Dorne
because we needed your help.

366
00:39:07,263 --> 00:39:09,390
You came to Dorne
because you needed our help.

367
00:39:10,307 --> 00:39:13,435
What is your name again? Barbaro?

368
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:16,397
- Obara.
- Obara.

369
00:39:17,106 --> 00:39:18,482
You look like an angry little boy.

370
00:39:18,566 --> 00:39:21,318
Don't presume to tell me what I need.

371
00:39:21,402 --> 00:39:22,820
Forgive my sister.

372
00:39:22,903 --> 00:39:24,655
What she lacks in diplomacy, she makes...

373
00:39:24,738 --> 00:39:27,283
Do shut up, dear. Anything from you?

374
00:39:28,117 --> 00:39:29,201
No? Good.

375
00:39:30,286 --> 00:39:32,037
Let the grown women speak.

376
00:39:33,789 --> 00:39:36,500
The Lannisters have declared war
on House Tyrell.

377
00:39:37,167 --> 00:39:39,628
They have declared war on Dorne.

378
00:39:39,753 --> 00:39:43,132
We must be allies now if we wish to survive.

379
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,844
Cersei stole the future from me.

380
00:39:47,553 --> 00:39:48,637
She killed my son.

381
00:39:49,638 --> 00:39:51,473
She killed my grandson.

382
00:39:52,099 --> 00:39:54,059
She killed my granddaughter.

383
00:39:55,227 --> 00:39:57,813
Survival is not what I'm after now.

384
00:39:58,272 --> 00:39:59,982
ELLARIA: You're absolutely right.

385
00:40:00,524 --> 00:40:02,818
I chose the wrong words.

386
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:05,321
It is not survival I offer.

387
00:40:05,613 --> 00:40:07,656
It is your heart's desire.

388
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:08,991
<i>(DINGING)</i>

389
00:40:09,867 --> 00:40:12,995
And what is my heart's desire?

390
00:40:14,288 --> 00:40:15,331
Vengeance.

391
00:40:16,665 --> 00:40:17,708
Justice.

392
00:40:21,712 --> 00:40:23,589
Fire and blood.

393
00:40:30,346 --> 00:40:32,139
Your ships are nearly ready.

394
00:40:33,098 --> 00:40:35,351
I saw them painting the sails.

395
00:40:38,687 --> 00:40:42,399
I'm curious to see how the Dothraki
do on the poison water.

396
00:40:42,483 --> 00:40:44,068
You're not coming with us.

397
00:40:46,737 --> 00:40:48,364
New strategy?

398
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:53,035
You want the Second Sons
to attack from the west coast?

399
00:40:53,619 --> 00:40:55,913
If we take Casterly Rock,

400
00:40:56,538 --> 00:40:59,625
the Lannisters will have nowhere to run
when you hit King's Landing.

401
00:40:59,708 --> 00:41:01,710
You're not going to Westeros.

402
00:41:02,252 --> 00:41:04,713
You're staying here with the Second Sons.

403
00:41:05,339 --> 00:41:07,883
There's finally peace in Meereen.

404
00:41:07,967 --> 00:41:10,719
You will keep the peace
while the people choose their own leaders.

405
00:41:12,054 --> 00:41:13,180
Fuck Meereen.

406
00:41:14,056 --> 00:41:16,225
Fuck the people.

407
00:41:16,308 --> 00:41:18,268
I'm here for you, not them.

408
00:41:18,352 --> 00:41:20,104
DAENERYS: You promised me.

409
00:41:20,187 --> 00:41:23,107
"My sword is yours. My life is yours."

410
00:41:24,108 --> 00:41:26,318
This is what I command.

411
00:41:27,653 --> 00:41:30,948
If I'm going to rule in Westeros,
I'll need to make alliances.

412
00:41:32,408 --> 00:41:35,411
The best way to make alliances
is with marriage.

413
00:41:39,081 --> 00:41:40,749
Who are you marrying this time?

414
00:41:40,791 --> 00:41:44,336
I don't know. Maybe no one.

415
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:47,715
But you need to lure
all the noble houses to the table?

416
00:41:47,756 --> 00:41:49,341
Are you a queen or fish bait?

417
00:41:52,094 --> 00:41:54,930
I can't bring a lover to Westeros.

418
00:41:54,972 --> 00:41:57,266
A king wouldn't think twice about it.

419
00:41:57,349 --> 00:42:00,102
So that's what you want? To be my mistress?

420
00:42:00,185 --> 00:42:01,228
I'm not proud.

421
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:05,899
I don't care what perfumed aristocrat
sits beside you in the throne room.

422
00:42:05,941 --> 00:42:08,777
I don't want a crown. I want you.

423
00:42:16,452 --> 00:42:18,078
I love you.

424
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,621
And I make you happy.

425
00:42:21,415 --> 00:42:22,833
You know I do.

426
00:42:24,918 --> 00:42:28,422
Bring me with you. Let me fight for you.

427
00:42:36,305 --> 00:42:37,347
I can't.

428
00:42:47,524 --> 00:42:48,984
The dwarf told you to do this?

429
00:42:49,026 --> 00:42:50,819
DAENERYS: No one tells me to do anything.

430
00:42:50,903 --> 00:42:54,281
Clever fellow. Can't argue with his logic.

431
00:42:54,323 --> 00:42:55,741
I'm no use to you over there.

432
00:42:55,824 --> 00:42:57,201
Don't get angry.

433
00:42:57,284 --> 00:43:00,496
I'm not angry. I'm full of self-pity.

434
00:43:00,579 --> 00:43:02,164
Who comes after you?

435
00:43:02,206 --> 00:43:05,375
Who can ever follow Daenerys Stormborn,
the Mother of Dragons?

436
00:43:05,459 --> 00:43:07,836
A great number of women, I imagine.

437
00:43:14,176 --> 00:43:16,011
Specific orders will be left for you

438
00:43:16,053 --> 00:43:19,306
regarding the welfare of Meereen
and the Bay of Dragons.

439
00:43:19,348 --> 00:43:20,933
The Bay of Dragons?

440
00:43:21,016 --> 00:43:22,935
We can't call it Slaver's Bay anymore,
can we?

441
00:43:27,106 --> 00:43:30,234
You'll get that throne you want so badly,
I'm sure of it.

442
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:33,445
I hope it brings you happiness.

443
00:43:38,909 --> 00:43:41,370
I pity the lords of Westeros.

444
00:43:41,912 --> 00:43:43,664
They have no idea what's coming for them.

445
00:43:44,832 --> 00:43:47,209
Farewell, Daario Naharis.

446
00:44:07,104 --> 00:44:08,981
How did he take it?

447
00:44:09,064 --> 00:44:10,399
No tears.

448
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:14,653
I know it was hard for you.

449
00:44:15,821 --> 00:44:17,865
You turned away a man who truly loves you

450
00:44:17,906 --> 00:44:20,617
because he would have been a liability
in the Seven Kingdoms.

451
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:26,999
That's the kind of self-sacrifice
that makes for a good ruler,

452
00:44:27,082 --> 00:44:29,084
if it's any consolation.

453
00:44:32,296 --> 00:44:33,922
It's not.

454
00:44:34,006 --> 00:44:36,300
No, I suppose not.

455
00:44:36,383 --> 00:44:38,010
I'm terrible at consoling.

456
00:44:38,093 --> 00:44:39,303
Yes, you really are.

457
00:44:43,807 --> 00:44:47,811
All right, how about the fact
that this is actually happening?

458
00:44:49,229 --> 00:44:54,318
You have your armies, you have your ships,
you have your dragons.

459
00:44:54,401 --> 00:44:59,281
Everything you've ever wanted
since you were old enough to want anything,

460
00:44:59,364 --> 00:45:01,241
it's all yours for the taking.

461
00:45:03,327 --> 00:45:05,162
Are you afraid?

462
00:45:08,123 --> 00:45:09,458
Good.

463
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:12,961
You're in the great game now.

464
00:45:13,003 --> 00:45:15,005
And the great game's terrifying.

465
00:45:16,006 --> 00:45:19,801
The only people who aren't afraid of failure
are madmen like your father.

466
00:45:22,721 --> 00:45:24,389
Do you know what frightens me?

467
00:45:26,058 --> 00:45:28,477
I said farewell to a man who loves me.

468
00:45:30,646 --> 00:45:31,980
A man I thought I cared for.

469
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:36,318
And I felt nothing.

470
00:45:37,861 --> 00:45:39,488
Just impatient to get on with it.

471
00:45:43,075 --> 00:45:45,118
He wasn't the first to love you

472
00:45:46,036 --> 00:45:48,121
and he won't be the last.

473
00:45:52,167 --> 00:45:56,630
Well, you have completely
failed to console me.

474
00:45:59,508 --> 00:46:00,842
For what it's worth,

475
00:46:00,926 --> 00:46:03,595
I've been a cynic
for as long as I can remember.

476
00:46:04,263 --> 00:46:07,099
Everyone's always asking me
to believe in things.

477
00:46:07,182 --> 00:46:10,519
Family, gods, kings, myself.

478
00:46:11,186 --> 00:46:15,023
It was often tempting
until I saw where belief got people.

479
00:46:16,692 --> 00:46:19,027
So I said, "No, thank you," to belief.

480
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:22,364
And yet, here I am.

481
00:46:25,242 --> 00:46:27,536
I believe in you.

482
00:46:30,289 --> 00:46:31,957
It's embarrassing, really.

483
00:46:34,126 --> 00:46:36,420
I'd swear you my sword,

484
00:46:36,503 --> 00:46:38,046
but I don't actually own a sword.

485
00:46:39,047 --> 00:46:40,882
It's your counsel I need.

486
00:46:42,009 --> 00:46:43,510
It's yours.

487
00:46:43,552 --> 00:46:44,886
Now and always.

488
00:46:46,513 --> 00:46:47,848
Good.

489
00:46:49,641 --> 00:46:50,851
I, um...

490
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:53,603
I had something made for you.
