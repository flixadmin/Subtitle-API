1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:01,156
Previously on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:02,180
No, Adrian!

3
00:00:03,082 --> 00:00:04,714
The two of you are
working for Ricardo Diaz.

4
00:00:04,716 --> 00:00:06,805
You're both fired
effective immediately.

5
00:00:06,806 --> 00:00:08,306
Obviously, the mayor

6
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:10,230
terminated us
to impede the prosecution

7
00:00:10,231 --> 00:00:11,931
of his activities
as the Green Arrow.

8
00:00:11,933 --> 00:00:14,133
What Oliver Queen did is
an impeachable offense.

9
00:00:14,135 --> 00:00:17,203
The way you lead
alienates

10
00:00:17,205 --> 00:00:19,705
everyone and everything
around you. Look.

11
00:00:19,707 --> 00:00:22,641
You put the team
at risk by lying!

12
00:00:22,643 --> 00:00:24,443
You leave a trail
of bodies

13
00:00:24,445 --> 00:00:26,412
every damn place
that you go!

14
00:00:26,414 --> 00:00:27,913
My trail of bodies

15
00:00:27,915 --> 00:00:29,915
doesn't include
my own brother.

16
00:00:29,917 --> 00:00:31,917
Truth is, Oliver,
you have become a better man

17
00:00:31,919 --> 00:00:34,887
but, with your focus split,
a worse leader.

18
00:00:34,889 --> 00:00:36,789
If I'm gonna be
the best version of myself,

19
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:38,591
it can't be with you.

20
00:00:41,662 --> 00:00:43,496
You told Rebecca
what's going on?

21
00:00:43,498 --> 00:00:44,964
You kidding? She'd have
my nuts in a vise

22
00:00:44,966 --> 00:00:46,899
if she knew I was
on the take.

23
00:00:46,901 --> 00:00:48,501
She doesn't get it.
It's a different city now.

24
00:00:48,503 --> 00:00:50,636
It's a different world.

25
00:00:50,638 --> 00:00:52,071
We better call
backup.

26
00:00:52,073 --> 00:00:53,472
It might just be
a power surge.

27
00:00:53,474 --> 00:00:55,207
It's not.
Call backup now!

28
00:00:55,209 --> 00:00:57,143
Unh!

29
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,579
What the hell?

30
00:01:00,581 --> 00:01:03,215
Come on out,
you son of a bitch!

31
00:01:03,217 --> 00:01:04,784
Where's Diaz?

32
00:01:04,786 --> 00:01:06,952
Somewhere inside
surrounded by a hundred cops.

33
00:01:06,954 --> 00:01:08,854
You'll never
get to him.

34
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:14,193
- He's here.
- That was predictable.

35
00:01:14,195 --> 00:01:17,797
lockdown mode now.
Protect Diaz.

36
00:01:34,248 --> 00:01:36,015
Agh!

37
00:01:47,528 --> 00:01:49,428
Where's Diaz?

38
00:01:50,898 --> 00:01:52,231
Agh!

39
00:01:52,233 --> 00:01:53,265
Where's Diaz?

40
00:01:53,267 --> 00:01:55,067
In there.

41
00:02:04,545 --> 00:02:06,945
This is gonna be fun.

42

44
00:02:14,948 --> 00:02:17,149
Allies are
in short supply for mayor Queen

45
00:02:17,225 --> 00:02:18,824
as the city reacts
in the wake

46
00:02:18,826 --> 00:02:20,793
of the sudden firing
of Captain Kimberly Hill

47
00:02:20,795 --> 00:02:22,695
and D.A. Samir Armand.

48
00:02:22,697 --> 00:02:25,531
Though city hall maintains
the firings had no relation

49
00:02:25,533 --> 00:02:27,500
to the ongoing investigation
into the mayor's

50
00:02:27,502 --> 00:02:30,402
reputed vigilantism
as the Green Arrow,

51
00:02:30,404 --> 00:02:32,037
sources
within the city council say

52
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:34,874
that impeachment
is highly possible.

53
00:02:34,876 --> 00:02:36,675
No. They can't actually
impeach you for firing

54
00:02:36,677 --> 00:02:38,244
two people
on Diaz's payroll.

55
00:02:38,246 --> 00:02:41,413
They can if they claim I did it
to protect myself.

56
00:02:41,415 --> 00:02:44,283
Look. We need
rock-solid proof

57
00:02:44,285 --> 00:02:46,118
that they are
working for Diaz.

58
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,453
That's why you have me,

59
00:02:47,455 --> 00:02:48,854
but in the meantime,
I have something else.

60
00:02:48,856 --> 00:02:50,289
I just got some
more evidence

61
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:52,057
on how Diaz has
corrupted the SCPD.

62
00:02:52,059 --> 00:02:54,627
So ever since Dinah
and company got fired,

63
00:02:54,629 --> 00:02:56,328
I have been monitoring
the station's

64
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:57,763
internal security feed,

65
00:02:57,765 --> 00:03:00,799
and every night
at 10:13, this happens,

66
00:03:00,801 --> 00:03:03,969
and then--boop--
45 minutes later,

67
00:03:04,115 --> 00:03:07,016
the feed goes back
online like clockwork.

68
00:03:07,018 --> 00:03:09,452
He's monitoring
his minions in blue.

69
00:03:09,454 --> 00:03:11,321
- He's got to be.
- I agree.

70
00:03:11,323 --> 00:03:12,889
If you're thinking what I think
you're thinking,

71
00:03:12,891 --> 00:03:15,024
you need to stop
thinking it right now. It's bad.

72
00:03:15,026 --> 00:03:17,460
I can't make a move on Diaz
unless I know where he is,

73
00:03:17,462 --> 00:03:18,795
and you just told me
where he is

74
00:03:18,797 --> 00:03:20,430
every night at 10:13.

75
00:03:20,432 --> 00:03:22,065
You can't storm the bad cop castle
by yourself, Oliver.

76
00:03:22,067 --> 00:03:24,067
- It is suicide.
- If I get Diaz,

77
00:03:24,069 --> 00:03:25,535
this is all done--

78
00:03:25,537 --> 00:03:27,437
the investigation,
the corruption,

79
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:29,172
the impeachment,
all of it.

80
00:03:29,174 --> 00:03:30,406
I stop all of it.

81
00:03:30,408 --> 00:03:31,908
You can't go there
alone.

82
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:34,510
You will not
come out.

83
00:03:34,512 --> 00:03:35,611
You need help.

84
00:03:35,613 --> 00:03:37,580
All of our help quit.

85
00:03:37,582 --> 00:03:40,049
Well, maybe John
has changed his mind.

86
00:03:40,051 --> 00:03:41,851
What are you
talking about?

87
00:03:41,853 --> 00:03:43,953
Hey, Oliver.

88
00:03:48,493 --> 00:03:51,294
John.

89
00:03:51,296 --> 00:03:52,995
What do you need?

90
00:03:52,997 --> 00:03:54,497
Well, Felicity said
that she needed

91
00:03:54,499 --> 00:03:56,499
to update the code
on my chip.

92
00:03:56,501 --> 00:03:58,634
She also said that you
would be at city hall.

93
00:03:58,636 --> 00:04:01,037
Well, I said
he might be.

94
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:02,605
I didn't say
he would be,

95
00:04:02,607 --> 00:04:04,307
and, yeah,
I "Parent Trapped" you,

96
00:04:04,309 --> 00:04:06,075
but it was a little naive
of you to think

97
00:04:06,077 --> 00:04:07,443
that I wouldn't
considering how well

98
00:04:07,445 --> 00:04:08,978
you know me, you know.

99
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,947
Now that we are
all together,

100
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:13,716
we can talk
about what happened.

101
00:04:13,718 --> 00:04:15,852
I'm pretty sure John
has said everything he needs to say.

102
00:04:15,854 --> 00:04:17,487
I think you're
absolutely right. I did.

103
00:04:17,489 --> 00:04:19,088
Guys, this isn't
about what he said

104
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:20,523
or what he said
or your egos.

105
00:04:20,525 --> 00:04:21,991
We have bigger problems
at hand here.

106
00:04:21,993 --> 00:04:23,526
We need to stop Diaz,

107
00:04:23,528 --> 00:04:25,294
and we have
some pretty good Intel.

108
00:04:25,296 --> 00:04:26,863
Good Intel tends
to fall apart in the hands

109
00:04:26,865 --> 00:04:28,564
of bad leadership,
don't you think?

110
00:04:28,566 --> 00:04:30,867
Oliver, come on.
It doesn't have to be that way.

111
00:04:30,869 --> 00:04:33,503
How would you
like it to be?

112
00:04:33,505 --> 00:04:35,138
Well, it doesn't change
the fact that neither of you

113
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,839
can take down
Diaz alone.

114
00:04:36,841 --> 00:04:38,641
I think there's more
than one way to catch Diaz.

115
00:04:38,643 --> 00:04:40,410
I've been offered
a job at A.R.G.U.S.

116
00:04:40,412 --> 00:04:41,978
Gonna take it?

117
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,780
Thinking about it. Why?

118
00:04:43,782 --> 00:04:45,948
Last time you needed something
from A.R.G.U.S., you had to steal it.

119
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:49,485
Oliver, you keep
that attitude, man,

120
00:04:49,487 --> 00:04:51,554
you're gonna end up
all alone.

121
00:04:51,556 --> 00:04:53,122
I've listened
to your advice

122
00:04:53,124 --> 00:04:55,391
for the last
6 years.

123
00:04:55,393 --> 00:04:57,760
I think I've earned
a reprieve.

124
00:05:02,367 --> 00:05:05,568
That is not how
I thought that would go.

125
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:08,871
Sure it was. This is
who he is, Felicity,

126
00:05:08,873 --> 00:05:11,340
and no one knows that
more than you.

127
00:05:14,813 --> 00:05:17,313
Elected officials
cannot fire

128
00:05:17,315 --> 00:05:20,316
the very law enforcement personnel
investigating them.

129
00:05:20,318 --> 00:05:23,052
To do so is the definition of
obstruction of justice.

130
00:05:23,054 --> 00:05:24,554
Captain Hill
and D.A. Armand

131
00:05:24,556 --> 00:05:26,222
were actively sabotaging
this city

132
00:05:26,224 --> 00:05:28,624
by aligning themselves
with Ricardo Diaz.

133
00:05:28,626 --> 00:05:30,860
I was not obstructing
justice.

134
00:05:30,862 --> 00:05:33,930
- I was serving it.
- From what I understand,

135
00:05:33,932 --> 00:05:37,200
Ricardo Diaz is
a second-rate drug dealer

136
00:05:37,202 --> 00:05:39,535
who was released
from prison on a technicality.

137
00:05:39,537 --> 00:05:41,370
I fail to see
your point.

138
00:05:41,372 --> 00:05:42,905
The idea that he
could compromise

139
00:05:42,907 --> 00:05:45,942
a police captain
and a district attorney

140
00:05:45,944 --> 00:05:47,643
is laughable.

141
00:05:47,645 --> 00:05:49,345
I assume that the mayor

142
00:05:49,347 --> 00:05:51,414
will get a chance to address
the city council,

143
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:53,416
lay out the facts
as he sees them.

144
00:05:53,418 --> 00:05:55,384
Preliminary impeachment
proceedings

145
00:05:55,386 --> 00:05:56,953
begin
this afternoon.

146
00:05:56,955 --> 00:05:58,754
The mayor
will have a chance

147
00:05:58,756 --> 00:06:00,957
to plead his case,
of course.

148
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,458
For your sake,
Mr. mayor,

149
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,393
and for the sake
of your administration,

150
00:06:04,395 --> 00:06:06,395
I hope you have something more
concrete to offer

151
00:06:06,397 --> 00:06:10,600
the council other
than unsupported suspicions.

152
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:16,038
And I know we
haven't always gotten along,

153
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,208
but I do believe
in due process.

154
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:21,277
I'll make sure
the council

155
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:23,346
approaches this
fairly.

156
00:06:23,348 --> 00:06:25,748
I will see you
and the council this afternoon

157
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,617
with evidence.

158
00:06:31,456 --> 00:06:34,156
Uh, you mind if I ask
what evidence exactly?

159
00:06:34,158 --> 00:06:36,058
Felicity's working on it.

160
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,760
Oh. I guess that's
somewhat reassuring.

161
00:06:37,762 --> 00:06:39,662
On the bright side,
if I get impeached, you get promoted.

162
00:06:39,664 --> 00:06:41,430
Heh heh heh!
I'm not much

163
00:06:41,432 --> 00:06:42,899
of a politician,
Oliver.

164
00:06:42,901 --> 00:06:44,333
Well, with Diaz
running the city,

165
00:06:44,335 --> 00:06:46,402
it's not really
politics, is it?

166
00:06:46,404 --> 00:06:51,073
Is that the only
thing bothering you--Diaz?

167
00:06:51,075 --> 00:06:52,708
You've looked
better.

168
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,143
John quit.

169
00:06:56,147 --> 00:06:59,115
I'd say he quit
the team, but...

170
00:06:59,117 --> 00:07:01,017
There's no team.

171
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,853
He seems to think
I'm to blame for that.

172
00:07:03,855 --> 00:07:05,621
Well, I don't see
it that way.

173
00:07:05,623 --> 00:07:07,623
- You're not there, Quentin.
- Yeah, I know,

174
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:10,259
but I was there when the hood first
showed up, remember,

175
00:07:10,261 --> 00:07:12,828
and that guy bears
very little resemblance

176
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,764
to the guy I'm
talking to now.

177
00:07:14,766 --> 00:07:17,166
I mean, look at you.
You're the mayor, you're a family man.

178
00:07:17,168 --> 00:07:19,201
You're out busting
your hump every night for this city.

179
00:07:19,203 --> 00:07:21,704
I've seen how much
you've changed, Oliver.

180
00:07:21,706 --> 00:07:23,372
So why is all this
happening?

181
00:07:23,374 --> 00:07:25,708
Cayden James and Diaz,
they've done a number,

182
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:26,943
but things
will get better.

183
00:07:26,945 --> 00:07:30,313
You just got to
stay the course.

184
00:07:30,315 --> 00:07:31,981
Where you going?

185
00:07:31,983 --> 00:07:34,216
I'm going to check in
on Felicity,

186
00:07:34,218 --> 00:07:35,718
see if she's making
any progress,

187
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,020
and I promised William
that I would take him

188
00:07:38,022 --> 00:07:39,789
to his science fair.

189
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:41,157
It's not
the best timing.

190
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:43,392
Eh, I think schools
plan it that way.

191
00:07:45,964 --> 00:07:47,730
Well, I mean,
you outdid me.

192
00:07:47,732 --> 00:07:50,232
For my science fair project,
all I did was hack Napster.

193
00:07:50,234 --> 00:07:52,134
What's Napster?

194
00:07:52,136 --> 00:07:54,737
Wow. I am getting older
by the minute.

195
00:07:54,739 --> 00:07:56,539
I can't believe you
cloned a cabbage.

196
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:59,008
When I was a girl,
cabbage grew in the ground.

197
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:00,743
Well, you're a long
way from home, Raisa.

198
00:08:00,745 --> 00:08:03,045
That I know.
I'll put these in the car.

199
00:08:03,047 --> 00:08:05,481
- Thank you.
- I just really hope it's better

200
00:08:05,483 --> 00:08:07,683
than Sarah Epstein's
solar hot dog cooker.

201
00:08:07,685 --> 00:08:09,852
She's really been
talking it up.

202
00:08:09,854 --> 00:08:11,187
We're gonna be late.
Where's dad?

203
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:12,755
- Oh, he'll be here in--
- Hey.

204
00:08:12,757 --> 00:08:14,690
- Finally. Let's go.
- Yeah. I know.

205
00:08:14,692 --> 00:08:16,692
I just got to talk
to Felicity for one second.

206
00:08:16,694 --> 00:08:18,961
- But we're already late.
- Just a minute. I promise.

207
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,900
Council's convening.
I promised them

208
00:08:24,902 --> 00:08:26,235
I would show
them something.

209
00:08:26,237 --> 00:08:27,837
Prepare to be
happy.

210
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:29,438
Documentation
of threats from Diaz

211
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,641
to Hill's family
and bank statements

212
00:08:31,643 --> 00:08:33,743
proving that he paid
for Armand's son's cancer treatment.

213
00:08:33,745 --> 00:08:35,011
- That's it. That's good work.
- Yeah. It's really good work.

214
00:08:35,013 --> 00:08:36,679
It might be too good
of work.

215
00:08:36,681 --> 00:08:38,280
Without the SCPD,
the only person that

216
00:08:38,282 --> 00:08:40,349
can really obtain this
type of evidence is--

217
00:08:40,351 --> 00:08:43,185
well, as far as city council's
concerned is you.

218
00:08:43,187 --> 00:08:45,721
Are you telling me
that the single piece of evidence

219
00:08:45,723 --> 00:08:47,757
that will stop
this imminent impeachment

220
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:50,760
is also the evidence that will directly
connect me to being the Green Arrow?

221
00:08:50,762 --> 00:08:52,461
I mean, you could tell them that
you're married to a super-hacker.

222
00:08:52,463 --> 00:08:54,030
- That's not funny.
- I know.

223
00:08:54,032 --> 00:08:55,564
I tried to plant
a fake trail.

224
00:08:55,566 --> 00:08:57,299
It was just that
I ran out of time.

225
00:08:57,301 --> 00:08:59,001
You ran out of time
because you're focusing

226
00:08:59,003 --> 00:09:02,138
on making John and I
reconcile instead of doing your job.

227
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,240
- Hey. I'm on your side here.
- Are you on my side?

228
00:09:04,242 --> 00:09:06,208
- Of course I'm on your side.
- Are you sure you're on my side?

229
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:08,144
How could you even say
something like that?

230
00:09:08,146 --> 00:09:09,812
- What is wrong with you?
- Dad, you said you'd--

231
00:09:09,814 --> 00:09:11,747
William, I'm right in the middle
of something, please.

232
00:09:11,749 --> 00:09:14,083
- We're gonna be late.
- Well, then we're gonna be late!

233
00:09:19,991 --> 00:09:22,158
Buddy, I'm really sorry.

234
00:09:23,795 --> 00:09:25,828
- Get out.
- Felicity, it was an accident.

235
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:28,664
I will take care
of William.

236
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:30,599
Get out.

237
00:09:48,853 --> 00:09:50,619
- Oh!
- Oh! What's wrong?

238
00:09:50,621 --> 00:09:52,154
Looks like you half-expected me
to be a member

239
00:09:52,156 --> 00:09:54,256
of the League
of Assassins.

240
00:09:54,258 --> 00:09:58,461
No. I thought I heard
something.

241
00:09:58,463 --> 00:10:00,663
-How's William?
- He won't come out of his room.

242
00:10:01,899 --> 00:10:03,632
Look. I don't--

243
00:10:03,634 --> 00:10:05,468
I have no idea
what came over me,

244
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:10,306
what made me lose it,
uh, on him like that.

245
00:10:10,308 --> 00:10:12,842
Everything's piling up.

246
00:10:12,844 --> 00:10:14,343
Yeah, I know.

247
00:10:14,345 --> 00:10:16,846
I think we should take
some space, Oliver.

248
00:10:21,486 --> 00:10:23,018
Um...

249
00:10:26,057 --> 00:10:27,656
I'm sorry. What?

250
00:10:27,658 --> 00:10:29,859
How you lost it
on William,

251
00:10:29,861 --> 00:10:32,294
that is crossing
a line.

252
00:10:32,296 --> 00:10:33,863
I know that you have
a lot on your plate

253
00:10:33,865 --> 00:10:36,031
with Diaz and John
and the impeachment,

254
00:10:36,033 --> 00:10:37,733
but that is
no excuse.

255
00:10:37,735 --> 00:10:39,635
It can't be an excuse.
He's your son,

256
00:10:39,637 --> 00:10:42,872
and you just showed him the man
his father really is.

257
00:10:44,008 --> 00:10:46,542
That is not the man
that I married.

258
00:11:01,068 --> 00:11:02,968
Hey.

259
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:06,505
- You ok?
- Thanks for coming.

260
00:11:06,507 --> 00:11:09,775
Listen. I, uh, know
I've said this already,

261
00:11:09,777 --> 00:11:12,778
but, uh, you don't
look good.

262
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,580
Felicity...

263
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:22,555
Felicity found proof that Hill
and Armand are in bed with Diaz.

264
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:25,424
That's great.
It's great.

265
00:11:26,627 --> 00:11:28,527
Why you got a face
that says otherwise?

266
00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:31,764
Council's gonna
ask me how I got that evidence.

267
00:11:31,766 --> 00:11:33,399
And you don't exactly
want to tell them it's-- it's your wife.

268
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:35,634
Just shine
a big fat light

269
00:11:35,636 --> 00:11:38,404
on the suspicion
I'm the Green Arrow.

270
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,773
What are you gonna do?

271
00:11:40,775 --> 00:11:42,508
I don't know.

272
00:11:44,211 --> 00:11:47,813
My wife wants
a separation.

273
00:11:47,815 --> 00:11:50,649
I lost my temper
in front of my son.

274
00:11:52,186 --> 00:11:54,620
I scared him.

275
00:11:54,622 --> 00:11:56,288
It was really bad.

276
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:59,091
Well, you know, I mean,
just apologize to the kid,

277
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,961
sleep on the couch
for the night, and--

278
00:12:01,963 --> 00:12:04,530
a separation just seems
a little extreme.

279
00:12:04,532 --> 00:12:08,167
You know, Quentin,
with everything that's been happening,

280
00:12:08,169 --> 00:12:10,002
it feels like par
for the course.

281
00:12:10,004 --> 00:12:11,303
You talking
about John Diggle?

282
00:12:11,305 --> 00:12:14,840
John, Curtis, Rene,
Dinah.

283
00:12:14,842 --> 00:12:16,909
Why haven't you
quit?

284
00:12:16,911 --> 00:12:19,845
Promise of a raise.

285
00:12:19,847 --> 00:12:24,183
Ohh. Look. You said--
you said I've changed.

286
00:12:24,185 --> 00:12:26,218
I--I appreciated
what you said.

287
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:34,159
Why does everyone
keep leaving me?

288
00:12:34,161 --> 00:12:36,829
That's the thing
about change, right?

289
00:12:36,831 --> 00:12:38,864
You hope you're doing
the right thing

290
00:12:38,866 --> 00:12:40,866
by becoming
a better person,

291
00:12:40,868 --> 00:12:43,435
but you're also becoming
a different person.

292
00:12:43,437 --> 00:12:45,971
Some people, they just--
I guess like John,

293
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,773
they just react badly.

294
00:12:47,775 --> 00:12:49,541
- That's one possibility.
- What's the other?

295
00:12:49,543 --> 00:12:51,477
That I haven't really
changed at all.

296
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:54,313
Oh, come on.
I don't buy that.

297
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,848
What you've told me
about John and Curtis,

298
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:58,217
all those guys, they got their own
issues, all right?

299
00:12:58,219 --> 00:12:59,818
They're just putting
them on you.

300
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,888
And Felicity?

301
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:05,457
Felicity loves you, man.

302
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:07,259
That thing with her
and William, it's gonna blow over.

303
00:13:07,261 --> 00:13:08,927
Don't worry about that.

304
00:13:08,929 --> 00:13:10,863
My advice--

305
00:13:10,865 --> 00:13:15,134
you just got to focus on what's
right in front of us now, ok?

306
00:13:15,136 --> 00:13:16,935
I'm gonna reach out
to Samanda Watson.

307
00:13:16,937 --> 00:13:18,671
Maybe she can help
cover us on this.

308
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:20,239
Quentin, the woman
wants me in prison.

309
00:13:20,241 --> 00:13:21,907
But she also wants
justice, right?

310
00:13:21,909 --> 00:13:24,410
Taking down a crime boss
who's overrun a city

311
00:13:24,412 --> 00:13:27,713
seems to fit the bill
in my eyes.

312
00:13:27,715 --> 00:13:30,315
Yeah, call her.

313
00:13:30,317 --> 00:13:33,652
Now listen.
That council meeting's in an hour.

314
00:13:33,654 --> 00:13:35,921
I got to focus.
I got to--I got to push

315
00:13:35,923 --> 00:13:37,523
this stuff
out of my head,

316
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:38,924
but I'll--I'll--
I'll be there.

317
00:13:38,926 --> 00:13:40,859
See you back
at city hall.

318
00:14:10,925 --> 00:14:14,059
Hello, Oliver.
Long time.

319
00:14:15,529 --> 00:14:19,064
No. You--
you killed yourself.

320
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:23,435
Funny thing. You never did go
back for my body.

321
00:14:23,437 --> 00:14:26,205
Guess you were somewhat
preoccupied, right?

322
00:14:26,207 --> 00:14:29,308
Still, seems
a little careless.

323
00:14:30,945 --> 00:14:32,911
Come on, man!
You've seen people come back

324
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:35,280
from what seemed
like certain death.

325
00:14:35,282 --> 00:14:38,016
As I recall...

326
00:14:38,018 --> 00:14:40,052
You once were stabbed

327
00:14:40,054 --> 00:14:42,020
and fell off
of a mountain,

328
00:14:42,022 --> 00:14:43,822
yet here you are!

329
00:15:20,694 --> 00:15:22,461
Do it!

330
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:23,996
I didn't last time.

331
00:15:23,998 --> 00:15:26,865
And then I killed
the mother of your son.

332
00:15:26,867 --> 00:15:29,301
I'm not playing games
this time.

333
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:30,803
This time, I'm
coming for you

334
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:33,005
and Felicity
and William,

335
00:15:33,007 --> 00:15:37,643
anyone and everyone
who's ever been close to you...

336
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:40,012
And there's only
one way

337
00:15:40,014 --> 00:15:41,680
that you can stop me.

338
00:16:14,481 --> 00:16:18,016
Oh, now wasn't
that better?

339
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:21,887
You know, you might
just have to start considering

340
00:16:21,889 --> 00:16:25,123
the possibility that I'm just not
killable, Oliver.

341
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,859
Heh.

342
00:16:29,496 --> 00:16:33,866
No, Adrian.
You're dead.

343
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:37,936
Still on Lian Yu.

344
00:16:46,146 --> 00:16:48,313
I'm hallucinating.

345
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:05,321
I knew you'd
kill me or try to.

346
00:17:05,323 --> 00:17:07,257
I always was the one person
who saw you

347
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:09,459
for the murderer
you are.

348
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:12,495
What are you doing?

349
00:17:12,497 --> 00:17:15,999
Oh. Oh. You're
running a blood test.

350
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:18,601
You think you've been
dosed with something.

351
00:17:18,603 --> 00:17:21,604
You know, there is
another explanation,

352
00:17:21,606 --> 00:17:27,410
a more likely one
in my considered opinion.

353
00:17:27,412 --> 00:17:30,146
You're finally
going crazy.

354
00:17:30,148 --> 00:17:31,781
It's completely
understandable, Ollie.

355
00:17:31,783 --> 00:17:33,416
You've lost everything. Heh.

356
00:17:33,418 --> 00:17:35,885
Even the people I couldn't
manage to take from you.

357
00:17:35,887 --> 00:17:38,021
I really like
this Ricardo Diaz.

358
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:40,290
If he didn't exist,
I'd have to think him up myself.

359
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:42,625
He's going about all
of this exactly right.

360
00:17:42,627 --> 00:17:48,097
Don't--don't hurt
the people that you love.

361
00:17:48,099 --> 00:17:51,201
Just get them all
to abandon you.

362
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:53,136
It's actually the easiest
thing in the world.

363
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:55,605
I told you this, Ollie.
I told you this, man.

364
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:58,341
Everything you touch
dies.

365
00:17:59,911 --> 00:18:01,744
What you're going
through right now--

366
00:18:01,746 --> 00:18:04,714
losing your team,
your wife, the impeachment--

367
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:08,651
all of it is happening just
like I told you it would,

368
00:18:08,653 --> 00:18:11,921
and nothing
in that blood test

369
00:18:11,923 --> 00:18:15,158
is gonna change that.

370
00:18:19,497 --> 00:18:21,297
Well?

371
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:23,099
Vertigo?

372
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:27,270
Absorbed it
through my--

373
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,609
Ahh. Kullens.

374
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,510
Friend of yours?

375
00:18:34,512 --> 00:18:36,813
Apparently not.

376
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:45,655
Don't--don't
go talk to Quentin.

377
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:48,825
You are not in the state
of mind to be talking to him right now.

378
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:51,361
He might have you
committed,

379
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:53,363
which would be
a shame

380
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:54,664
since by my count
he's the only person

381
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,399
still left
in your corner.

382
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:58,501
Ok. Felicity, William,
and I will be fine.

383
00:18:58,503 --> 00:18:59,802
I just need to
talk to them.

384
00:18:59,804 --> 00:19:01,671
Maybe, but what
about the rest?

385
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:03,373
It's tough to say
you're in a good place

386
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,408
when your oldest friend
leaves you high and dry.

387
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:06,676
John made his choice.

388
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:09,379
Deep down, you know
he's right.

389
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:10,713
You've changed. Sure.

390
00:19:10,715 --> 00:19:14,951
Maybe you are a, uh--
a better Oliver Queen,

391
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:18,388
a happier
Oliver Queen...

392
00:19:20,892 --> 00:19:24,327
But it has sure made
you a worse hero.

393
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,729
You have a wife,
a son, you're the mayor,

394
00:19:26,731 --> 00:19:29,032
all of which, yes,
may be going away,

395
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:33,303
but still, it's
a fair assumption.

396
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:35,371
You're stretched
too thin, buddy.

397
00:19:35,373 --> 00:19:39,409
Maybe you've gotten
so good at being Oliver Queen

398
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:43,379
that the Green Arrow's
mission is suffering.

399
00:19:43,381 --> 00:19:47,750
You may be happier,
but the people that you love,

400
00:19:47,752 --> 00:19:50,653
they're not.

401
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:53,489
Hey. What's
Vertigo do?

402
00:19:53,491 --> 00:19:55,425
Does it show you
your worst fear?

403
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:57,460
You're not
my worst fear, Adrian.

404
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:01,230
You're nowhere close.

405
00:20:01,232 --> 00:20:06,102
Oh. I know.
Your worst fear is yourself.

406
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:08,438
Your worst enemy
is yourself.

407
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:14,410
Guys like me, Ricardo Diaz,
Damien Darhk, Ra's al Ghul,

408
00:20:14,412 --> 00:20:17,714
when it comes
to destroying you, Oliver,

409
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:20,817
we all come
in second place.

410
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:29,058
You're the one enemy
you can't defeat.

411
00:20:39,237 --> 00:20:40,737
Yes, Quentin?

412
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,271
Hearing's about to start.
Where the hell are you?

413
00:20:42,273 --> 00:20:44,774
Well, Kullens dosed me
with Vertigo,

414
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:46,542
and I have been
dealing with it.

415
00:20:46,544 --> 00:20:49,345
Didn't you say that
Diaz was dealing Vertigo these days?

416
00:20:49,347 --> 00:20:51,981
Well, Kullens is
working for Diaz apparently.

417
00:20:51,983 --> 00:20:54,117
Listen. Where are we
with Agent Watson?

418
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:56,819
- She's mulling it over.
- She's got to mull faster.

419
00:20:56,821 --> 00:20:58,454
All right. I'll give
her another call.

420
00:20:58,456 --> 00:21:00,757
Listen. Just get down here as fast
as you can, all right?

421
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,825
I'm on my way.

422
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,718
Ollie.

423
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,657
Why are you looking
at me like that?

424
00:21:38,548 --> 00:21:40,751
Ollie?

425
00:21:40,753 --> 00:21:42,552
Are you ok?

426
00:21:42,554 --> 00:21:43,887
I don't know.

427
00:21:43,889 --> 00:21:45,589
You know, if
you tell her the truth,

428
00:21:45,591 --> 00:21:47,324
she'll just think
you're crazy, Oliver.

429
00:21:47,326 --> 00:21:49,459
You'll break her heart
all over again.

430
00:21:49,461 --> 00:21:51,028
Nobody wants that.

431
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:53,930
Hey. Hey. You can tell
me anything. You know that.

432
00:21:53,932 --> 00:21:55,799
I know that.

433
00:21:58,404 --> 00:21:59,703
I need to leave.

434
00:21:59,705 --> 00:22:01,705
I thought
the boat left at 6:00.

435
00:22:01,707 --> 00:22:03,607
- What?
- The Gambit,

436
00:22:03,609 --> 00:22:05,675
the trip that you're
going on with your father.

437
00:22:05,996 --> 00:22:08,664
I ran into Sara. She said that you
hadn't packed yet.

438
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:10,265
Do you want me
to help you?

439
00:22:10,267 --> 00:22:12,034
Man, look at how
innocent she was,

440
00:22:12,036 --> 00:22:13,669
how much
she loved you.

441
00:22:13,671 --> 00:22:15,838
-You destroyed that.
-Ollie.

442
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,040
Oh. Tell her about
her future, man.

443
00:22:18,042 --> 00:22:19,641
Tell--tell her
about what happens

444
00:22:19,643 --> 00:22:21,710
when she becomes
the Black Canary.

445
00:22:21,712 --> 00:22:23,679
Ollie, please help me.

446
00:22:23,681 --> 00:22:25,514
Please. I'm scared.

447
00:22:25,516 --> 00:22:27,349
I don't want to die.

448
00:22:27,351 --> 00:22:30,085
This is gonna destroy
my father.

449
00:22:30,087 --> 00:22:31,386
He can't handle this.

450
00:22:31,388 --> 00:22:32,988
She's got
a point.

451
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:35,891
My question is,
why did you let her

452
00:22:35,893 --> 00:22:39,027
become the Black Canary
in the first place?

453
00:22:39,029 --> 00:22:40,395
Heh. She's a lawyer.

454
00:22:40,397 --> 00:22:42,397
What, after a couple
self-defense classes

455
00:22:42,399 --> 00:22:44,032
and a few sparring
sessions with you,

456
00:22:44,034 --> 00:22:46,535
you think she's ready
to go handle thugs and killers?

457
00:22:50,074 --> 00:22:53,041
- It was a mistake.
- Yeah. Your mistake.

458
00:22:53,043 --> 00:22:54,610
Which I had to pay for.

459
00:22:54,612 --> 00:22:56,845
It was a mistake...

460
00:22:58,883 --> 00:23:00,816
But I knew you,

461
00:23:00,818 --> 00:23:03,218
and I knew that
you would do it

462
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,687
with or without me.

463
00:23:07,658 --> 00:23:09,591
I thought this way
I could protect you.

464
00:23:09,593 --> 00:23:13,462
And how did that work out
for you, Ollie, huh?

465
00:23:13,464 --> 00:23:17,232
Yeah, Ollie.
How'd that work out for her?

466
00:23:17,234 --> 00:23:18,734
For me, not too good.

467
00:23:18,736 --> 00:23:21,837
Uh-uh. I gave you an out.

468
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:23,472
I told you to stand down.

469
00:23:23,474 --> 00:23:26,208
- Stay down!
- No way!

470
00:23:28,712 --> 00:23:30,946
You know, John came
to see me in here.

471
00:23:30,948 --> 00:23:34,149
Felicity, too,
but you were nowhere, Hoss.

472
00:23:34,151 --> 00:23:35,517
He's got
a point, Oliver.

473
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:37,152
If your conscience
is so sparkly clean,

474
00:23:37,154 --> 00:23:38,787
why didn't you
check on Rene?

475
00:23:38,789 --> 00:23:40,989
You were here.
Rene made it clear.

476
00:23:40,991 --> 00:23:43,225
Matter of fact,
all of you have made it clear

477
00:23:43,227 --> 00:23:45,227
that you don't want
anything to do with me.

478
00:23:45,229 --> 00:23:47,229
Always a comeback
for everything.

479
00:23:47,231 --> 00:23:50,165
That's enough.

480
00:23:50,167 --> 00:23:52,000
It's not real.

481
00:23:58,409 --> 00:24:00,375
Raisa.

482
00:24:02,513 --> 00:24:05,848
It's not safe here
for you.

483
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:07,349
A man came.

484
00:24:07,351 --> 00:24:09,384
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey.

485
00:24:09,386 --> 00:24:10,786
Raisa, what--what man?

486
00:24:10,788 --> 00:24:13,288
With a dragon tattoo.

487
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:15,290
He wants to hurt you.

488
00:24:15,292 --> 00:24:18,660
I tried to stop him.

489
00:24:20,397 --> 00:24:24,433
Little lady
wouldn't go down without a fight.

490
00:24:24,435 --> 00:24:27,836
Your wife and kid
aren't here.

491
00:24:27,838 --> 00:24:30,172
They're at some
science fair.

492
00:24:30,174 --> 00:24:32,341
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on.

493
00:24:32,343 --> 00:24:35,811
You still think
this isn't real?

494
00:24:35,813 --> 00:24:38,013
Unh!

495
00:24:38,015 --> 00:24:41,450
Does that feel real
enough for you?

496
00:24:43,087 --> 00:24:47,322
I always wondered
why nobody just does that--

497
00:24:47,324 --> 00:24:49,625
kill you straight.

498
00:24:49,627 --> 00:24:51,727
Turns out, it'd be
a waste of time.

499
00:24:51,729 --> 00:24:54,563
You're more dangerous
as a martyr

500
00:24:54,565 --> 00:24:57,332
than you are
as Green Arrow,

501
00:24:57,334 --> 00:25:00,235
but before
that happens,

502
00:25:00,237 --> 00:25:03,405
there's a lot left
of you

503
00:25:03,407 --> 00:25:06,108
that I want to break.

504
00:25:17,187 --> 00:25:18,487
Ohh.

505
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:24,259
Ugh.

506
00:25:27,097 --> 00:25:30,299
Ahh.

507
00:25:44,381 --> 00:25:47,950
Yeah. Quentin, hi.
I'm gonna need that hearing delayed.

508
00:25:47,952 --> 00:25:50,352
I'll explain everything.
I'm on my way to city hall.

509
00:25:51,455 --> 00:25:56,158
You have failed
this city,

510
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,927
and you know why.

511
00:25:58,929 --> 00:26:01,129
Because I got
away from you.

512
00:26:01,131 --> 00:26:03,632
You were never supposed
to have partners.

513
00:26:03,634 --> 00:26:06,535
There was never supposed
to be a John Diggle,

514
00:26:06,537 --> 00:26:08,670
a Felicity Smoak,

515
00:26:08,672 --> 00:26:10,372
a team Arrow.

516
00:26:10,374 --> 00:26:14,409
There was never supposed
to be a Green Arrow.

517
00:26:14,411 --> 00:26:16,678
There was only the mission!

518
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,413
I lost sight of that.

519
00:26:18,415 --> 00:26:20,515
You lost your city!

520
00:26:20,517 --> 00:26:24,486
And now you know
what you have to do

521
00:26:24,488 --> 00:26:27,222
to get it back.

522
00:26:35,666 --> 00:26:37,432
It's been
over an hour.

523
00:26:37,434 --> 00:26:39,001
Where is the mayor?

524
00:26:39,003 --> 00:26:42,104
Well, why don't
you ask Ricardo Diaz?

525
00:26:44,808 --> 00:26:46,408
Apologies
for being late.

526
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:48,210
Over an hour late,

527
00:26:48,212 --> 00:26:49,911
and we certainly hope
you've come with something

528
00:26:49,913 --> 00:26:52,247
worthy of our time.

529
00:26:52,249 --> 00:26:53,949
One minute.

530
00:26:54,885 --> 00:26:57,586
- You all right?
- No.

531
00:26:58,856 --> 00:27:01,223
Where are we
with Watson?

532
00:27:01,225 --> 00:27:03,091
We're on our own.

533
00:27:05,596 --> 00:27:07,429
It's our only card.

534
00:27:07,431 --> 00:27:09,398
You sure you want to
play it?

535
00:27:11,235 --> 00:27:13,468
It's our only card.

536
00:27:22,212 --> 00:27:26,882
- Mr. Mayor.
- Ok. This flash drive,

537
00:27:26,884 --> 00:27:31,053
it contains financial data
and correspondence linking

538
00:27:31,055 --> 00:27:35,424
Captain Hill and D.A. Armand
with a known felon

539
00:27:35,426 --> 00:27:37,392
named Ricardo Diaz.

540
00:27:37,394 --> 00:27:39,027
Known by whom?

541
00:27:39,029 --> 00:27:41,029
I've never heard
of a Ricardo Diaz.

542
00:27:41,031 --> 00:27:43,231
By design. He's kept
a very low profile.

543
00:27:43,233 --> 00:27:45,534
How did you obtain
this purported evidence

544
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:49,838
against our former police captain
and district attorney?

545
00:27:52,142 --> 00:27:54,543
The Green Arrow
gave it to me.

546
00:27:55,746 --> 00:27:57,646
Or perhaps you gave it
to yourself.

547
00:27:57,648 --> 00:27:58,980
I'm not the Green Arrow.

548
00:27:58,982 --> 00:28:00,482
Not according to
the police captain

549
00:28:00,484 --> 00:28:02,317
or D.A.
that you fired.

550
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:04,920
And it also seems
rather convenient

551
00:28:04,922 --> 00:28:07,055
that you're not
the Green Arrow

552
00:28:07,057 --> 00:28:11,526
but enjoy a close personal
relationship with him.

553
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:16,398
That go down
how you expected?

554
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,066
Are you aware
that we can impeach you

555
00:28:18,068 --> 00:28:20,735
not just for obstruction
of justice

556
00:28:20,737 --> 00:28:23,205
but for perjury
and vigilantism, as well?

557
00:28:23,207 --> 00:28:24,906
Ok. I am so sorry,
but something

558
00:28:24,908 --> 00:28:26,575
very urgent
has just come in.

559
00:28:26,577 --> 00:28:28,110
I need to speak
to the mayor, please,

560
00:28:28,112 --> 00:28:29,377
so, uh, please.

561
00:28:29,379 --> 00:28:31,546
10 minutes...Tops.

562
00:28:31,548 --> 00:28:33,381
Thank you.

563
00:28:36,987 --> 00:28:38,320
Wait, wait.
What's happening?

564
00:28:38,322 --> 00:28:40,555
Are Felicity and William
all right?

565
00:28:40,557 --> 00:28:42,090
Listen. The urgent thing
was just a lie to buy us some time.

566
00:28:42,092 --> 00:28:43,592
Felicity and William
are fine, ok?

567
00:28:43,594 --> 00:28:45,894
It is you
I'm worried about.

568
00:28:45,896 --> 00:28:48,563
Have you still got
that Vertigo crap in your system?

569
00:28:50,467 --> 00:28:53,335
- Yep.
- Ok. Listen. We need to retreat,

570
00:28:53,337 --> 00:28:56,071
we need to regroup, ok,
so I'm gonna go back in there,

571
00:28:56,073 --> 00:28:58,540
and I'm gonna tell them you got
a family emergency.

572
00:28:58,542 --> 00:29:01,243
You might not
be wrong.

573
00:29:01,245 --> 00:29:03,678
Ok. Listen. You need
to go back to your secret lair.

574
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,847
Get yourself well.

575
00:29:05,849 --> 00:29:07,883
We'll figure out
the next steps.

576
00:29:13,157 --> 00:29:18,293
Sorry, Oliver.
Bad beat,

577
00:29:18,295 --> 00:29:19,561
but for what it's worth,
I always thought

578
00:29:19,563 --> 00:29:22,564
you were a halfway
decent mayor.

579
00:29:22,566 --> 00:29:26,535
Not a great track record
when it comes to hiring D.A.s, though.

580
00:29:28,372 --> 00:29:30,705
This Vertigo

581
00:29:30,707 --> 00:29:34,743
is going to be out
of my system eventually,

582
00:29:34,745 --> 00:29:37,679
and you'll be gone.

583
00:29:37,681 --> 00:29:39,548
Not possible.

584
00:29:41,118 --> 00:29:44,119
I'm not here, remember?

585
00:29:46,557 --> 00:29:48,356
I'm here.

586
00:29:48,358 --> 00:29:51,426
I'm you...

587
00:29:51,428 --> 00:29:53,228
Which is why you're
gonna listen to me

588
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:55,397
when I tell you
what you have to do.

589
00:29:55,399 --> 00:29:58,967
The only way to prove
that you're the hero that you say you are

590
00:29:58,969 --> 00:30:02,804
and keep being mayor
is to take down Diaz tonight.

591
00:30:02,806 --> 00:30:04,172
No. He's got an army.

592
00:30:04,174 --> 00:30:06,241
You mean, all those cops
at the SCPD?

593
00:30:06,243 --> 00:30:08,310
I mean that walking
in there is a suicide mission.

594
00:30:08,312 --> 00:30:11,613
That's the risk a hero takes,
isn't it, Oliver?

595
00:30:11,615 --> 00:30:16,084
Diaz is there
every night, 10:13 pm.

596
00:30:16,086 --> 00:30:18,620
The question is

597
00:30:18,622 --> 00:30:21,122
will you be there
to meet him?

598
00:30:29,783 --> 00:30:31,743
Thanks for helping me
put my project back together.

599
00:30:31,744 --> 00:30:34,124
No problemo.
Second place, too.

600
00:30:34,125 --> 00:30:36,092
Pretty good even
if that cheater

601
00:30:36,094 --> 00:30:39,214
Sarah Epstein got the gold for her
solar hot dog cooker

602
00:30:39,215 --> 00:30:41,715
that I swear I've seen
on Amazon.

603
00:30:42,685 --> 00:30:45,719
Ohh. You know,
when I was your age,

604
00:30:45,721 --> 00:30:47,688
I could hit, like,
3 science fairs a day,

605
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:52,359
and now one--one
knocks me right out.

606
00:30:52,361 --> 00:30:54,195
- Where's dad?
- Ohh. He's buying us

607
00:30:54,197 --> 00:30:57,097
expensive gifts if he knows what's
good for him.

608
00:30:57,099 --> 00:30:58,799
Uh, your purse
is beeping.

609
00:31:02,038 --> 00:31:04,104
- William, go play video games.
- What--

610
00:31:04,106 --> 00:31:05,706
got to do some work,
buddy, all right?

611
00:31:05,708 --> 00:31:08,442
- I'm sorry.
- I know what kind of work.

612
00:31:08,444 --> 00:31:10,244
Good luck.

613
00:31:12,048 --> 00:31:14,215
Pick up, pick up, pick up...

614
00:31:18,054 --> 00:31:20,020
- Quentin.
- Felicity.

615
00:31:20,022 --> 00:31:21,722
Tell me Oliver's
with you.

616
00:31:21,724 --> 00:31:23,624
Well, he was. I--I just sent him
back to the bunker.

617
00:31:23,626 --> 00:31:25,426
No. He's not
on his way there.

618
00:31:25,428 --> 00:31:26,861
I have a GPS on his bow,
and it's on the move.

619
00:31:26,863 --> 00:31:28,362
All right. Slow down.
Let me explain.

620
00:31:28,364 --> 00:31:30,064
It has been a hell
of an afternoon.

621
00:31:30,066 --> 00:31:32,433
-What happened?
-Oliver was dosed with Vertigo.

622
00:31:32,435 --> 00:31:33,934
- Kullens did it.
- That would explain why

623
00:31:33,936 --> 00:31:35,603
he lost it
on William.

624
00:31:35,605 --> 00:31:37,471
He said, you, uh--
you kicked him out.

625
00:31:37,473 --> 00:31:39,406
No, I didn't.
I would never.

626
00:31:39,408 --> 00:31:40,975
Uh, he's on his way
to the precinct.

627
00:31:40,977 --> 00:31:42,476
I mean, that's
totally my fault.

628
00:31:42,478 --> 00:31:43,911
I told him that Diaz
would be there.

629
00:31:43,913 --> 00:31:45,646
Quentin, this is
a suicide mission.

630
00:31:45,648 --> 00:31:46,981
- You have to stop him.
- I'm on my way.

631
00:31:46,983 --> 00:31:48,482
Ok.

632
00:31:48,484 --> 00:31:50,217
What's happening?
Is dad all right?

633
00:31:50,219 --> 00:31:52,786
No. Dad is on drugs.
I mean, not that kind of drugs.

634
00:31:52,788 --> 00:31:55,089
He's gonna be fine.
I just--I have to go help him, ok?

635
00:31:55,091 --> 00:31:57,858
I know. I was listening.

636
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,793
You're an angel.

637
00:31:59,795 --> 00:32:01,495
Actually an angel.

638
00:32:05,601 --> 00:32:08,969
- Hey!
- Get out of here, Quentin.

639
00:32:08,971 --> 00:32:10,571
What are you doing
in that old thing?

640
00:32:10,573 --> 00:32:12,573
Getting back to my
original mission.

641
00:32:12,575 --> 00:32:14,108
Listen. That's just
the Vertigo talking.

642
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:16,110
- You cannot go in there!
- This ends tonight.

643
00:32:16,112 --> 00:32:17,745
Listen. Even if you weren't high, this
would be a bad idea.

644
00:32:17,747 --> 00:32:19,313
- You're outnumbered!
- I can handle it.

645
00:32:19,315 --> 00:32:23,050
- Listen to me.
- I said--unh--

646
00:32:23,052 --> 00:32:25,019
I can handle it.

647
00:32:35,898 --> 00:32:38,699
Quentin? Quentin!

648
00:32:38,701 --> 00:32:39,967
Hey! You ok?

649
00:32:39,969 --> 00:32:42,303
Oh. Wow. Your husband
packs a punch.

650
00:32:42,305 --> 00:32:44,305
Diaz's men cannot find
the deputy mayor here, ok?

651
00:32:44,307 --> 00:32:45,773
You have to get
out of here, all right?

652
00:32:45,775 --> 00:32:47,041
- Ooh.
- I have to go save my husband.

653
00:32:47,043 --> 00:32:49,009
Yep.

654
00:33:25,247 --> 00:33:26,547
Don't, don't, don't
don't, don't, don't!

655
00:33:26,549 --> 00:33:29,817
Ohh! Do not open
that door.

656
00:33:29,819 --> 00:33:31,552
On the other side of that door,
there's a bunch

657
00:33:31,554 --> 00:33:33,520
of trigger-happy cops
just waiting for you.

658
00:33:33,522 --> 00:33:35,322
- It is a trap.
- You're not here!

659
00:33:35,324 --> 00:33:36,957
Yes, I am.
It's me, ok?

660
00:33:36,959 --> 00:33:39,493
It's the real me.

661
00:33:39,495 --> 00:33:41,495
Do not go
through that door.

662
00:33:41,497 --> 00:33:44,031
I have to.
I have to stop Diaz.

663
00:33:44,033 --> 00:33:46,834
And you will,
but not like this, not tonight.

664
00:33:46,836 --> 00:33:48,836
He is right on the other side
of that door!

665
00:33:48,838 --> 00:33:51,338
So are a bunch of angry cops just
waiting for you.

666
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:53,941
You go through that door,
what happens to William?

667
00:33:53,943 --> 00:33:55,175
William has you.

668
00:33:55,177 --> 00:33:58,379
Well, what happens
to me?

669
00:33:58,381 --> 00:34:01,248
- You left.
- No, I didn't.

670
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:04,018
That was not me,
Oliver.

671
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:06,954
The real me is
standing right here,

672
00:34:06,956 --> 00:34:09,390
and I'm not going
anywhere.

673
00:34:09,392 --> 00:34:13,160
I'm glue, baby.
Please.

674
00:34:15,064 --> 00:34:17,831
Where are you?

675
00:34:17,833 --> 00:34:19,700
The Vertigo, it's making its way through
your system, ok?

676
00:34:19,702 --> 00:34:23,404
It's on its last gasp,
so just--just listen.

677
00:34:23,406 --> 00:34:25,472
Listen to my voice.

678
00:34:25,474 --> 00:34:28,042
No, no, no, no.
Don't. Don't listen to her.

679
00:34:28,044 --> 00:34:29,743
Remember what
your told yourself.

680
00:34:29,745 --> 00:34:31,845
You were never supposed
to have partners.

681
00:34:31,847 --> 00:34:34,481
I know it feels
like you've lost everything.

682
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:39,620
I don't know how to tell
if you're real.

683
00:34:39,622 --> 00:34:42,322
That's the Vertigo.
It's just messing with your head.

684
00:34:42,324 --> 00:34:44,925
Don't trust it.

685
00:34:44,927 --> 00:34:46,994
Ok. Listen
to your heart.

686
00:35:04,847 --> 00:35:06,713
Come on.

687
00:35:06,715 --> 00:35:09,049
Screw it.

688
00:35:09,051 --> 00:35:10,884
Go after him.

689
00:35:15,424 --> 00:35:17,024
- Ohh! Come on!
- Just like old times.

690
00:35:17,026 --> 00:35:18,959
Well, thanks
for coming back for me.

691
00:35:20,162 --> 00:35:22,296
Ok. Well, less thanking,
more escaping!

692
00:35:22,298 --> 00:35:23,697
Right!

693
00:35:36,047 --> 00:35:37,882
- What's this?
- It's an isotonic concoction

694
00:35:37,883 --> 00:35:38,608
of my own making.

695
00:35:38,609 --> 00:35:40,242
There are oranges
in there for vitamin C,

696
00:35:40,244 --> 00:35:41,877
there's almonds
in there for vitamin E,

697
00:35:41,879 --> 00:35:43,512
there's avocado
in there for omega-3s.

698
00:35:43,514 --> 00:35:45,747
Do not smell it.
Just drink it.

699
00:35:48,619 --> 00:35:50,285
- Salty.
- Yeah. That would be

700
00:35:50,287 --> 00:35:52,154
the fermented
fish oils.

701
00:35:52,156 --> 00:35:54,123
Supposed to help
balance your serotonin levels.

702
00:35:54,125 --> 00:35:56,191
I call it Felicity's party raver hangover
supreme cure! Heh.

703
00:35:56,193 --> 00:35:58,327
Though that might an insensitive choice
of words considering

704
00:35:58,329 --> 00:35:59,995
what you just
went through,

705
00:35:59,997 --> 00:36:01,663
but trust me--
it works like a charm.

706
00:36:01,665 --> 00:36:03,499
Not that I've
used it much.

707
00:36:03,501 --> 00:36:05,834
I mean, that was all in the past.
Trust me. Ahem.

708
00:36:05,836 --> 00:36:07,436
Drugs are bad.

709
00:36:07,438 --> 00:36:08,971
Listen.
That was gutsy as hell,

710
00:36:08,973 --> 00:36:10,372
you going in
the precinct like that.

711
00:36:10,374 --> 00:36:11,974
Yeah. Well, my man
was in there.

712
00:36:11,976 --> 00:36:13,775
Yeah, but whatever
you said to him

713
00:36:13,777 --> 00:36:15,377
could have been caught on
security cameras.

714
00:36:15,379 --> 00:36:16,979
No. Diaz had
shut them down,

715
00:36:17,129 --> 00:36:18,955
so our identities
are safe.

716
00:36:19,494 --> 00:36:21,727
Irony sold
separately.

717
00:36:21,729 --> 00:36:23,529
Excuse me.
I got to take this.

718
00:36:23,531 --> 00:36:25,731
It's the office.

719
00:36:25,733 --> 00:36:27,366
I haven't seen that
in a while.

720
00:36:27,368 --> 00:36:29,635
Wanted to take it
for a spin down memory lane

721
00:36:29,637 --> 00:36:31,504
- or something?
- Something like that.

722
00:36:31,506 --> 00:36:33,506
- Heh.
- The Vertigo gave me

723
00:36:33,508 --> 00:36:35,941
some...Clarity.

724
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:38,377
- Sure you're not still high?
- Mm-hmm.

725
00:36:38,379 --> 00:36:40,346
John had a point.

726
00:36:40,348 --> 00:36:42,715
I have spread myself
pretty thin.

727
00:36:44,318 --> 00:36:48,854
I'm not giving up on you,
not giving up on William,

728
00:36:48,856 --> 00:36:53,526
and if by some miracle,
I'm not impeached,

729
00:36:53,528 --> 00:36:55,861
I will keep being
the mayor.

730
00:36:58,199 --> 00:37:00,833
I believe deeply
in the good

731
00:37:00,835 --> 00:37:03,169
that I can do
as the Green Arrow...

732
00:37:05,506 --> 00:37:10,676
But I need to bring
the mission back to basics.

733
00:37:12,346 --> 00:37:14,847
I need to bring it back
to where it started.

734
00:37:14,849 --> 00:37:16,715
You mean alone.

735
00:37:16,717 --> 00:37:19,452
Alone.

736
00:37:19,454 --> 00:37:21,120
Sorry, guys.
I hate to interrupt,

737
00:37:21,122 --> 00:37:24,723
but, uh, we got to
turn the TV on. News.

738
00:37:24,725 --> 00:37:27,893
In a shocking fall from grace,
the Star City council has voted

739
00:37:27,895 --> 00:37:31,797
to impeach mayor Oliver Queen
and remove him from office.

740
00:37:31,799 --> 00:37:33,599
We now go live
to councilman Kullens'

741
00:37:33,601 --> 00:37:35,401
public statement.

742
00:37:35,403 --> 00:37:38,370
Mr. Queen's affect
at today's inquiry

743
00:37:38,372 --> 00:37:42,341
certainly placed his fitness
for office into question,

744
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:46,011
but fundamentally,
it was the unilateral firing

745
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:49,081
of Captain Hill and D.A. Armand

746
00:37:49,083 --> 00:37:52,485
that ultimately
sealed his fate.

747
00:37:52,487 --> 00:37:55,454
Sorry. I just couldn't stand
to listen to him any longer.

748
00:37:57,492 --> 00:37:59,492
Ok. Listen. I'm gonna
call Jean Loring.

749
00:37:59,494 --> 00:38:01,393
There's got to be
legal options we can pursue.

750
00:38:01,395 --> 00:38:02,695
No.

751
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:04,697
I don't want you wasting
any more time

752
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:06,398
or political capital
on me.

753
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,234
I don't give a crap
about political capital!

754
00:38:08,236 --> 00:38:13,405
You should because
you're the mayor now.

755
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:18,410
Thank you so much, Raisa,
for coming

756
00:38:18,412 --> 00:38:19,912
on such short notice.

757
00:38:19,914 --> 00:38:21,447
I'm used to it.

758
00:38:21,449 --> 00:38:22,481
Thank you, Raisa.

759
00:38:22,483 --> 00:38:23,682
Are you ok, Oliver?

760
00:38:23,684 --> 00:38:25,417
I'll be just fine,
thank you.

761
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,956
I know this question
might be questionable,

762
00:38:30,958 --> 00:38:35,127
but from what it sounded
like earlier--

763
00:38:35,129 --> 00:38:37,062
it's like you were
firing Overwatch.

764
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:39,231
I'm not firing anyone.

765
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:43,636
I just--I need to go
back to doing things

766
00:38:43,638 --> 00:38:46,138
like I did
when I started,

767
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:51,677
and that--that means
doing it alone.

768
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:53,679
I need to stop Diaz,

769
00:38:53,681 --> 00:38:55,281
and in order to do that,

770
00:38:55,283 --> 00:39:00,986
I need to have
a single-minded focus.

771
00:39:00,988 --> 00:39:03,188
I've got to separate
these two worlds.

772
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:05,291
I just don't think that that's the best
possible solution, Oliver.

773
00:39:05,293 --> 00:39:07,593
I respect your concern,

774
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:09,929
and I love you
very much for it.

775
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:11,730
We will talk more
about this,

776
00:39:11,732 --> 00:39:14,767
but I need to chat
with William.

777
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,602
Yeah.

778
00:39:24,679 --> 00:39:27,813
Hey.

779
00:39:27,815 --> 00:39:30,115
I didn't know
if you'd be awake.

780
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:31,617
I can't sleep.

781
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:34,553
I got a news alert
about the impairment.

782
00:39:34,555 --> 00:39:36,655
It's impeachment.

783
00:39:36,657 --> 00:39:39,358
Don't worry.
I'll be fine.

784
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,660
I'm worried
about you.

785
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:45,030
I'm really sorry
about before.

786
00:39:45,032 --> 00:39:49,001
I would never
purposefully

787
00:39:49,003 --> 00:39:50,836
try to make you
afraid or--

788
00:39:50,838 --> 00:39:52,738
Felicity said you were
on some sort of drug.

789
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:54,640
Accidentally.

790
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:56,475
I was dosed by someone

791
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:58,711
who works for the man
I'm trying to stop.

792
00:39:58,713 --> 00:40:00,679
Ricardo Diaz?

793
00:40:02,016 --> 00:40:03,282
Can you stop him?

794
00:40:03,284 --> 00:40:05,584
I think maybe
I found a way.

795
00:40:05,586 --> 00:40:07,186
Most importantly,

796
00:40:07,188 --> 00:40:10,823
I need to know that
I'm not gonna lose you

797
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:13,759
or Felicity...Ever.

798
00:40:13,761 --> 00:40:15,694
You won't.

799
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:36,882
Hey. What are you
doing here?

800
00:40:36,884 --> 00:40:38,450
I heard about
what happened.

801
00:40:38,452 --> 00:40:40,152
I wanted to see
how you were.

802
00:40:40,154 --> 00:40:42,221
Clearly, I should
have brought a broom.

803
00:40:42,223 --> 00:40:44,189
He's spiraling.

804
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:46,625
The Vertigo worked even
better than I was hoping.

805
00:40:46,627 --> 00:40:48,727
I don't understand
why you don't just put a bullet

806
00:40:48,729 --> 00:40:50,329
in him or 20.

807
00:40:50,331 --> 00:40:51,930
Because it'd be
a waste of time.

808
00:40:51,932 --> 00:40:54,433
He's more dangerous
as a martyr

809
00:40:54,435 --> 00:40:56,435
than as the Green Arrow.

810
00:40:57,672 --> 00:41:02,007
I'm gonna dismantle him
piece by piece.

811
00:41:02,009 --> 00:41:03,909
Like with
the impeachment?

812
00:41:05,846 --> 00:41:08,547
The impeachment was
just the latest step.

813
00:41:10,251 --> 00:41:12,951
And what's
the next one?

814
00:41:12,953 --> 00:41:15,421
We spread the word

815
00:41:15,423 --> 00:41:18,724
that with mayor Queen out

816
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:21,427
Star City,

817
00:41:21,429 --> 00:41:23,829
it's open for business.
