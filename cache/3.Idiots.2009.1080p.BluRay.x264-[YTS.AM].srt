Yes, yes, but via Vasant Vihar.

27
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,000

29
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,620
He said Rancho is coming.

30
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:34,750
What?

31
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,620
He said, "Come to the campus at 8.
On the tank."

32
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:41,170
Oh, shucks!

00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,250
You forgot your pants.

40
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:13,670
Now to the hotel, sir?

41
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:16,870
Yes, but via Imperial College of Engineering.

00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,370
Okay, sir.

43
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,420
Forgot my socks.

44

00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:45,120
This is Dhillon.
Where's my cab? On the runway?

50
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,500
Hey, Rancho.

51
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:08,290

Welcome, idiots.

55
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:20,500
Some "madeira" for you?

56
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,250
The same rum you
guzzled those days.

57
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,170
Have a drink.

58
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,040
Where is Rancho?

59
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,580
Patience. First look at this.

60

Forgot?

68
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,420
What's this?

69
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,830

79
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,920
5 years we've searched.
Don't know if he's alive,

80
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,710
and you think he'll show up
for your silly bet.

You gonna break his jaw
or should l?

83
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:05,750
So, why'd you call us here?

84
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,120
To meet Rancho.

85
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:11,670
Come and see where l've reached
and where he rots.

86

Yes.

88

160
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:14,670
Greetings.
Drop your pants, get stamped.

161
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:15,620
Name?

162
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:17,460
"Ranchhoddas Shyamaldas Chanchad."

163
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:21,620
What a mouthful!
Needs serious cramming.

164
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,420
Come on, pants off.

165
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:27,750
Being stubborn?

166
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,710
Wet pants not good, kiddo.
Take them off.

167
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,870
- Aall izz well.
- What's that?

168
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,620
Aall izz well.

169
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:41,620
What did he say?

170
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,960
Someone tell him.
Hey, James Bond.

171
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,290
Make him understand.

172
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:50,210
Take off your pants or
they are going to piss on you.

173
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:52,870
Hey, 007!
Ashamed to speak Hindi?

174
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:56,540
Sorry, sir, l was born in Uganda,
studied in Pondicherry,

175
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,080
so little slow in Hindi.

176
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:01,370
So explain slowly. No hurry.

177
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:04,790
Feeling cold?

178
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,580
Pray undress

179
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:12,750
or he'll do "urine-expulsion" on you.

180
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,670
Calls pissing "urine-expulsion"!

181
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:19,540
A true linguist
in the land of engineers!

182
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,750
Hey, come out of there.

183
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,290
Come out or...

184
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:40,580
or l'll do "urine-expulsion"
on your door.

187
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:02,250

188
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:06,710

Six.

193

Eight.

195
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,290
Nine.

196
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,000
Ten.

- What is this?
- Sir, nest.

213
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,830
- Whose?
- A koel bird's nest, sir.

214
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,920
Wrong.

215
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:32,830
A koel bird never
makes her own nest.

216
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,370
She lays her eggs
in other nests.

217
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:41,250
And when they hatch,
what do they do?

218
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:48,830
They push the other eggs
out of the nest.

219
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:53,790
Competition over.

220
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,670
Their life begins with murder.
That's nature.

221
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:02,080
Compete or die.

222
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,170
You also are like the koel birds.

223
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:14,870
And these are the eggs
you smashed to get into lCE.

224
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:20,330
Don't forget, lCE gets
400,000 applications a year,

225
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:24,870
and only 200 are selected - You!

226
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:30,120
And these? Finished.
Broken eggs.

227
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:34,750
My son... he tried for three years.

228
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,170
Rejected. Every time.

229
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,120
Remember, life is a race.

230
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,370
If you don't run fast,
you'll get trampled.

231
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,960
Let me tell you
a very interesting story.

232
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,500
This is an astronaut pen.

233
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:57,420
Fountain pens and ballpoint pens
don't work in outer space.

234
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:02,500
So, scientists spent millions
to invent this pen.

235
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:07,170
It can write at any angle, in any
temperature, in zero gravity.

236
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,330
One day, when I was a student,

237
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:11,370
the Director of our institute
called me.

238
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:14,080
He said, "Viru Sahastrabuddhe."
I said, "Yes, sir.'"

239
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:15,670
"Come here!"
I got scared.

240
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,250
He showed me this pen.

241
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,000
He said, "This is a
symbol of excellence."

242
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:24,830
"I give it to you."

243
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:30,580
"When you come across an
extraordinary student like yourself"

244
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,870
"...pass it onto him."

245
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:38,290
For 32 years, I've been
waiting for that student.

246
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:39,830
But no luck.

247
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:44,670
Anyone here, who'll strive
to win this pen?

248
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:49,370
Good. Hands down.

249
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,460
Shall I post it on the notice board?
I said "Put down your hands."

250
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,250
One question, sir.

251
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:03,210
Sir, if pens didn't work
in outer space,

252
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:06,370
why didn't the astronauts
use a pencil?

253
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,290
They'd have saved millions.

254
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:23,750
I will get back to you on this.

255
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:30,040
He zaps a Senior's privates at night,

256
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:33,500
fingers the Director in the day.
Best avoid him.

257
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:35,750
You deflated Virus' erection.

258
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:39,790
Your Majesty, thou art great.
Accept this humble offering.

259
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,370
Buzz off.
You don't have school?

260
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:44,290
Who'll pay for it? Your pop?

261
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:47,710
- Keep off my dad!
- Relax.

262
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:51,710
For school you don't need
tuition money, just a uniform.

263
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:57,330
Pick a school,
buy the uniform, slip into class.

264
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,620
In that sea of kids,
no one will notice.

265
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:03,040
- If I get caught?
- Then new uniform, new school.

266
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,420
- See that?
<i><font color="#80FFFF">- He was different...</i></font>

267
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:09,080
<i><font color="#80FFFF">He challenged conventions
at every stage.</i></font>

268

270

<i><font color="#80FFFF">He was the only one
who was not a machine.</i></font>

271
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:22,080
What is a machine?

272
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,040
Why're you smiling?

273
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:33,250
Sir, to study Engineering
was a childhood dream.

274
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,540
I'm so happy to be here finally.

275
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:40,960
No need to be so happy.
Define a machine.

276
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,790
A machine is anything that
reduces human effort, sir.

277
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:47,580
Will you please elaborate?

278
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:56,370
Anything that simplifies work,
or saves time, is a machine.

279
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:00,540
It's a warm day, press a button,
get a blast of air.

280
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,000
The fan... A machine!

281
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:05,790
Speak to a friend miles away.
The telephone... A machine!

282
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:09,040
Compute millions in seconds.
The calculator... A machine!

283
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:11,750
We're surrounded by machines.

284
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:14,790
From a pen's nib to a pants' zip,
all machines.

285
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,620
Up and down in a second.
Up, down, up, down...

286
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,920
What is the definition?

287
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,330
I just gave it to you, sir.

288
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,540
You'll write this in the exam?
This is a machine - up, down...

289
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:32,330
Idiot! Anybody else?

290
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:33,920
Yes?

291
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:36,580
Sir, machines are any combination
of bodies so connected

292
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:38,250
that their relative motions
are constrained,

293
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:40,790
and by which means, force
and motion may be transmitted

294
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,210
and modified as a screw
and its nut, or a lever arranged

295
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:46,000
to turn about a fulcrum
or a pulley about its pivot, etc...

296
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:48,210
especially, a construction,
more or less complex

297
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:50,210
consisting of a combination
of moving parts, or...

298
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:53,620
simple mechanical elements,
as wheels, levers, cams, etc...

299
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,920
Wonderful.

300
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:57,670
Perfect. Please sit down.

301
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,250
Thank you.

302
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:03,670
But sir, I said the same thing,
in simple language.

303
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:07,830
If you prefer simple language,
join an Arts and Commerce college.

304
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,830
But sir, one must get
the meaning too.

305
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:13,460
What's the point of blindly
cramming a bookish definition.

306
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:15,330
You think you're smarter
than the book?

307
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:20,670
Write the textbook definition, mister,
if you want to pass.

308
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:22,580
- But there are other books...
- Get out!

309
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:24,870
Why?

310
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,080
In simple language - Out!

311
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,870
Idiot!

312
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,420
So, we were discussing about
the machine...

313
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,960
Why're you back?

314
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,170
I forgot something.

315
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:48,670
What?

316
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:52,120
Instruments that record,
analyze, summarize, organize

317
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:54,540
debate and explain information;
that are illustrated, non-illustrated

318
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:56,580
hard-bound, paperback,
jacketed, non jacketed

319
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,710
with foreword, introduction,
table-of-contents, index

320
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,620
that are intended for the
enlightenment, understanding

321
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:02,460
enrichment, enhancement and
education of the human brain

322
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,710
through the sensory route of
vision, sometimes touch.

323
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:12,500
What do you mean?

324
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,040
Books, sir.

325
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
I forgot my books. May I?

326
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:19,040
Couldn't you ask simply?

327
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:22,670
I tried earlier, sir.
It simply didn't work.

328
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:31,790
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Professors kept Rancho

341
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,670
Sir. Excuse me, sir.

342
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,750
Mr. Joy Lobo!

343
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:15,080
Sir, if I could know the
convocation dates...

344
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:16,040
Why?

345
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,960
Dad wants to make
train reservations.

346
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:21,830
I'm the first engineer from my village.
Everyone wants to attend.

347
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:24,920
In that case, call your dad.

348
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,500
Please hurry up.
Don't waste my time.

349
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:34,960
Hello?

350
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:38,120
Dad, the Director wants to
speak to you.

351
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:39,290
Joy!

352
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,920
Mr. Lobo, your son won't
graduate this year.

353
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,420
What happened, sir?

354
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,670
He has violated all deadlines.

355
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:50,750
Mr. Lobo, it's an unrealistic project.

356
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,790
He is making some
nonsense helicopter.

357
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:57,710
I suggest you don't book
your tickets. I'm so sorry.

358
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,330
- Sir, I am this close, sir.
- Is your project ready?

359
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:06,710
- Is your project ready?
- Sir, see it once, please.

360
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,460
Submit it, and we'll consider.

361
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,960
- Sir, a small extension...
- Why, why should I?

362
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:14,170
After dad's stroke,
I couldn't focus for two months.

363
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:15,540
Did you stop eating?

364
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:17,080
No.

365
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:18,210
Stopped bathing?

366
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:20,250
So, why stop studying?

367
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:23,080
Sir, I'm very close.
See it once, please...

368
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:24,370
Mr. Lobo!

369
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:27,580
Sunday afternoon, my son
fell off a train and died.

370
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:32,830
Monday morning, I taught a class.
So, don't give me that nonsense.

371
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:38,000
I can give you sympathy,
not an extension.

372
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,670
Sir... I'm very close...

Dude's come up with an
amazing design.

386
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:05,080
A wireless camera atop a helicopter.

387
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,580
Can be used for
traffic updates, security... Wow!

388
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,870
But Virus said it's an
impractical design, it won't fly.

389
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:15,170
It will fly! We'll make it fly.

390
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:19,670
Don't tell Joy. It'll be a surprise.

391
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:22,710
We'll fly it up to his window
and capture his reaction.

392
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:25,420
If we work on his project,
who'll work on ours?

393
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:29,000
Tests, vivas, quizzes,
42 exams per semester.

394
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:30,830
You scare easily, bro.

395
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:36,460
Take your hand, put it over your
heart, and say, "Aal izz well."

396
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:38,830
- All is well?
- Aal izz well.

397
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,500
Words of wisdom from
His Holiness Guru Ranchhoddas.

398
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,120
We had an old watchman
in our village.

399
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:50,210
On night patrol, he'd call out,
"Aal izz well."

400
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:54,330
And we slept peacefully.
Then there was a theft,

401
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,580
and we learned that
he couldn't see at night!

402
00:30:56,870 --> 00:31:00,330
He'd just yell "Aal izz well",
and we felt secure.

403
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:06,790
That day I understood
this heart scares easily.

404
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,620
You have to trick it.

405
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:16,580
However big the problem,
tell your heart, "All is well, pal."

406
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,540
That resolves the problem?

407
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:21,580
No. But you gain courage to face it.

408
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,460
Learn it up, bro.
We're gonna really need it here.

455
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,040
Hey, take it up to Joy's window.

456
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:13,790
Take it higher.

457
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:16,290
Look at Silencer, the nude dude!

458
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:21,290
Joy, come out.

459
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:24,870
Come to the window.

460
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,460
Joy, look outside.

461
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:21,670
Good news, sir.

462
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,040
The police and Joy's father
have no clue.

463
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:28,670
Everyone thinks this is suicide.

464
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,080
The post mortem report,

465
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:34,710
Cause of Death:
Intense pressure on windpipe,

466
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:35,920
resulting in choking.

467
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:42,620
All think the pressure
on the jugular killed him.

468
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:47,290
What about the mental pressure
for the last four years?

469
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:49,170
That's missing in the report.

470
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,790
Engineers are a clever bunch...

471
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:58,580
They haven't made a machine
to measure mental pressure.

472
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,370
If they had, all would know...

473
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:05,000
this isn't suicide... It's murder.

474
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:13,120
How dare you blame me
for Joy's suicide?

475
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,830
If one student can't handle
pressure, is it our fault?

476
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:20,920
Life is full of pressures.
Will you always blame others?

477
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:25,170
I don't blame you, sir.
I blame the system.

478
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:30,790
Look at these statistics,
India ranks No.1 in suicides.

479
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,870
Every 90 minutes,
a student attempts suicide.

480
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:39,460
Suicide is a bigger killer than disease.

481
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:41,000
Something's terribly wrong, sir.

482
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:43,370
I can't speak for the rest...

483
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,000
but this is one of the
finest colleges in the country.

484
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:48,670
I've run this place for 32 years.

485
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:52,460
We were ranked 28th.
Now we're No.1.

486
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:54,210
What's the point, sir?

487
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:59,210
Here they don't discuss
new ideas or inventions.

488
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,920
They discuss grades,
jobs, settling in the USA.

489
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:12,120
They teach how to get good scores.
They don't teach Engineering.

490
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,500
Now you will teach me
how to teach?

491
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,870
No, sir, I...

492
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,210
Sir, my paper...

493
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,210
Vaidyanathan, please sit down.

494
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,870
Here is a self-proclaimed professor,

495
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:49,040
who thinks he is better than
our highly qualified teachers.

496
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:54,210
Professor Ranchhoddas Chanchad
will teach us Engineering.

497
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,460
We do not have all day.

498
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:55,670
You have 30 seconds
to define these terms.

499
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,120
You may refer to your books.

500
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:00,750
Raise your hand
if you get the answer.

501
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:05,420
Let's see who comes first,
who comes last.

502
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:09,500
Your time starts... now.

503
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,040
Time up.

504
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:43,580
Time up, sir.
Time up.

505
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:47,830
No one got the answer?

506
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:53,710
Now rewind your life by a minute.

507
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,750
When I asked this question,
were you excited? Curious?

508
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,670
Thrilled that you'd learn
something new?

509
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,870
Anyone?
...Sir?

510
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:09,620
No. You all got into a frantic race.

511
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:13,790
What's the use of such methods,
even if you come first.

512
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,420
Will your knowledge increase?
No, just the pressure.

513
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:21,870
This is a college,
not a pressure cooker.

514
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:27,620
Even a circus lion learns to sit
on a chair in fear of the whip.

515
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:32,210
But you call such a lion
"well trained", not "well educated".

516
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:33,250
Hello!

517
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:38,330
This is not a philosophy class.
Just explain those two words.

518
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:40,420
Sir, these words don't exist.

519
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:44,920
These are my friends' names.
Farhan and Raju.

520
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:58,370
Quiet!

521
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:02,710
Nonsense! Is this how
you'll teach Engineering?

522
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:05,080
Sir, I wasn't teaching
you Engineering.

523
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:07,170
You're an expert at that.

524
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,250
I was teaching you... how to teach.

525
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:16,000
And I'm sure one day you'll learn,

526
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
because unlike you, I never
abandon my weak students.

527
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:21,500
Bye, sir.

528
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:24,670
Quiet!

529
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:28,330
Quiet, I said.

530
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:35,170
I regret to inform you
that your son...

531
00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:36,420
Farhan...
Raju...

532
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:37,750
has fallen into bad company.

533
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:41,250
Without urgent corrective steps,
his future will be ruined.

534
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:45,620
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Virus' letters dropped on

537
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:54,750
Come in.

538
00:42:57,290 --> 00:42:58,250
See that?

539
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:02,210
We could afford
just one air-conditioner.

540
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:07,620
We put it in Farhan's room,
so he could study in comfort.

541
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:13,040
I didn't buy a car.
I manage with a scooter.

542
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,790
We put all our money
into Farhan's education.

543
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:21,420
We sacrificed our comforts
for Farhan's future. Understand?

544
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,420
You took these pictures, Farhan?

545
00:43:33,330 --> 00:43:35,330
He had that useless
obsession for a while.

546
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:37,960
Went around taking
pictures of animals.

547
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,830
Wanted to be a
wildlife photographer.

548
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:44,460
Son, what was your
score that year?

549
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:46,620
91%.

550
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:51,620
Hear that? Straight drop
from 94% to 91%.

551
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:56,210
You find it funny?

552
00:43:56,870 --> 00:44:00,960
No, sir, sorry. I'm just
amazed at the photos.

553
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,750
Why make him an engineer...
Why not a wildlife photographer?

554
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,080
Enough!

555
00:44:06,330 --> 00:44:11,620
I humbly request you.
Don't ruin my son's future.

556
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,500
Food's on the table, boys. C'mon.

557
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:22,710
If you ever visit again,
do eat with us.

572
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:08,290
Kammo's turned 28.
They demand a car in dowry.

573
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:11,540
If you don't study and earn,
how will she marry?

574
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:12,960
Some okra?

575
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:17,830
Okra is now 12 per kilo,
cauliflower is 10.

576
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:19,580
It's daylight robbery!

577
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:23,960
What will we eat if we get
warnings from your college?

578
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:25,120
Mom!

579
00:45:26,710 --> 00:45:27,670
Cottage cheese?

580
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:31,670
Cottage cheese should be sold
at the jewelers, in velvet pouches.

581
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,750
- Cottage cheese?
- No, no, it's okay.

582
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:35,960
Mom, please.

583
00:45:36,830 --> 00:45:38,620
Alright, I'll shut up.

584
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:44,790
Earn for the family,
slave like a maid,

585
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,290
and then take the vow of silence.

586
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:52,790
If not with my son, with whom
do I share my woes, his friends?

587
00:45:56,710 --> 00:45:57,790
Hey, Raju.

or console his mom?</i></font>

590
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:10,290
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Screw it, we thought,

591
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:25,040
Even his eczema cream
costs 55 now.

592
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:31,120
Another roti?

593
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:34,420
No, thank you.
We're through.

594
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:44,790
Okra for 12.
Cauliflower for 10.

595
00:46:47,830 --> 00:46:49,670
At least you were offered a meal.

596
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:53,370
Unlike your sadistic dad...
"Hitler" Qureshi!

597
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:56,210
And your mom is Mother Teresa...
Feeding us "eczema roti"!

598
00:46:56,460 --> 00:47:00,040
- Don't poke fun at my mom!
- Enough, you guys.

599
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:01,750
I'm famished. Let's eat out.

600
00:47:01,870 --> 00:47:04,250
It's month end. Who'll pay?
His Mother Teresa?

601
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:09,870
To eat out, you don't need money.
Just a uniform. Look...

602
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:14,330
- C'mon.
- Come.

603
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,170
Good evening,
good evening.

604
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:19,120
Oh, Uncle.

605
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:27,670
- Three large vodkas.
- Half soda, half water.

606
00:47:27,870 --> 00:47:29,120
If we're caught, we're dead.

607
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:31,830
- What's for starters?
- Get double portions.

608
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,960
Leave this here and
start some peppy music.

609
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:37,370
Pia, what the hell is this?

610
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:40,460
Why're you wearing
this ancient piece of junk?

611
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:45,250
What'll people say? My fiancee...

612
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:48,250
a doctor in the making,
wearing a cheap, 200 watch!

613
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:50,670
Please take it off. Thank you.

614
00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:52,250
Hi, handsome.

615
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:55,210
Hey, Aunty.
You're looking good.

616
00:47:55,290 --> 00:47:57,870
- Don't miss my set, darling.
- Rubies?

617
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:00,670
- From Mandalay
- Mandalay... Wow!

618
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:03,460
- Hey, let's go meet David.
- Of course.

619
00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:07,710
Excuse me.

620
00:48:09,870 --> 00:48:11,040
Yes?

621
00:48:11,330 --> 00:48:12,420
Flowers.

622
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,120
- May I take the glass?
- Why?

623
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:19,710
So you don't break it on my head.

624
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:21,750
Why would I do that?

625
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:24,290
For the free advice I'll now impart.

626
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:26,330
What?

627
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:28,250
Don't marry that ass.

628
00:48:29,330 --> 00:48:30,250
Excuse me?

629
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:32,170
He's not a human,
he's a price tag.

630
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:35,580
He'll turn your life into a
nightmare of brands and prices.

631
00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:38,790
He'll ruin your life.
Your future will be finished.

632
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:39,960
Want a demonstration?

633
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:43,750
Shall I find out
the price of his shoes?

634
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:47,210
I won't ask.
He'll announce it himself.

635
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:05,210
What the hell...
Mint sauce on my $300 shoes!

636
00:49:05,330 --> 00:49:08,540
Run for your life!
It's free advice. Take it or leave it.

637
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:11,790
Genuine Italian leather,
hand-stitched!

638
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:19,080
Dad, are they your guests?

639
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:25,710
My students.
What're they doing here?

640
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:30,870
Hold on, Dad.

641
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:34,670
These beans smell great.

642
00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:37,120
- No room for roti.
- Just pile it on.

643
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:40,460
- Hi.
- Hey.

644
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
That was an eye-opener.
Thank you so much.

645
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,790
It was my moral responsibility.

646
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:51,000
Can I ask you for little more help?

647
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:54,710
Dad won't let me break off
this engagement.

648
00:49:55,670 --> 00:49:59,670
You explain so well.
Can you give him a demo too?

649
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:02,580
Certainly.
Raju, the mint sauce.

650
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:04,580
You're really sweet.

651
00:50:05,790 --> 00:50:08,870
- Where is your daddy?
- Right behind you.

652
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:15,830
Aal izz well.

653
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:21,790
Run for your life!
It's free advice. Take it or leave it.

654
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:23,620
What're you doing here?

655
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:27,370
We'll hand these gifts
to the couple.

656
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:30,710
I'll do that for you.
It's my sister's wedding.

657
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:32,290
Sister?

658
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:37,540
Sir, what's the sum total
of your daughters?

659
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,000
Empty. No gift cheques.

660
00:50:40,330 --> 00:50:42,420
Forgot the cheques, Raju... Farhan?

661
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:46,670
We didn't invite you,
you must be from the groom's side.

662
00:50:47,170 --> 00:50:51,120
No, sir, we're here
as the emissaries of science.

663
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:53,460
How? Can you explain?

664
00:50:53,710 --> 00:50:57,370
Dad, he explains superbly.
I'm sure he'll give us a demo.

665
00:50:57,670 --> 00:50:58,620
Won't you?

666
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:03,040
Well, Delhi has plenty of
power cuts that...

667
00:51:03,290 --> 00:51:05,620
disrupt wedding celebrations.

668
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:08,080
So I thought of making
an inverter that...

669
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:10,620
draws power from guests' cars.

670
00:51:10,830 --> 00:51:12,210
I see.

671
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:13,920
Wow!

672
00:51:14,290 --> 00:51:15,710
So, where's the inverter?

673
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:18,120
Sir, the design is ready.

674
00:51:21,210 --> 00:51:22,500
Where's the design, Farhan?

675
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:25,960
- I gave you the design.
- I gave it to Raju.

676
00:51:26,370 --> 00:51:27,330
Raju, design?

677
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:34,170
Never mind the design.
I'll make the inverter and show you.

678
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:38,170
You can only invent stories,
not an inverter.

679
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:41,540
I'll make one, I promise.

680
00:51:41,870 --> 00:51:45,370
And I'll name it after you.
After all, it was invented...

681
00:51:45,790 --> 00:51:49,290
at your daughter's wedding.
So it'll be an honor...

682
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:55,460
Farhan, Raju. I'll see you
in my office tomorrow.

683
00:52:01,330 --> 00:52:04,830
Sir, what was the cost per plate?
We'll reimburse you...

684
00:52:05,170 --> 00:52:06,830
... in installments.

685
00:52:09,290 --> 00:52:12,540
- We'll never crash a wedding again.
- Not even my own.

686
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:14,920
In fact, I won't even marry.
Nor will he.

687
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:17,620
Uh... right. No marriage.

688
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:21,500
Your parents shouldn't have
married either.

689
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:25,710
The world would have
to feed two less idiots.

690
00:52:28,210 --> 00:52:29,250
Sit!

691
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:41,290
Pay attention.

692
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:57,170
This is Ranchhoddas' father's
monthly income.

693
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:04,830
Couple of zeroes less,
and it's still a sizeable income.

694
00:53:07,370 --> 00:53:13,710
But erase another zero,
and I would worry a little.

695
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:18,330
Isn't that your father's income,
Mr. Farhan?

696
00:53:19,210 --> 00:53:20,920
Yes, sir.

697
00:53:22,290 --> 00:53:24,330
Now take away another zero...

698
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:31,170
and that's your family income,
Raju Rastogi.

699
00:53:32,330 --> 00:53:33,710
Big reason to worry.

700
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:45,580
Take my advice and shift into
Chatur Ramalingam's room.

701
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,250
Exams are here. Stay with
Rancho and you're sure to fail.

702
00:54:12,170 --> 00:54:14,580
- Want a shave?
- No, sir.

703
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:15,620
Then get lost!

704
00:54:26,870 --> 00:54:32,460
Raju, don't worry. This is Virus' move
to split us. Divide and rule.

705
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:33,670
I have to worry.

706
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:37,580
He grades us, and I need
good grades for a good job.

707
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:41,540
Unlike you, I don't have
a rich dad I can live off.

708
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:43,540
Shut up, Raju.

709
00:54:43,790 --> 00:54:46,460
Must we follow all his hogwash?
"Aal izz well".

710
00:54:46,830 --> 00:54:48,290
I won't be his flunky... like you.

711
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:51,540
- You're crossing the line.
- No, I'm drawing one.

712
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:53,750
I have a family to support.

713
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:58,210
Dad's medicines
swallow up mom's pension.

714
00:55:00,170 --> 00:55:04,540
My sis can't marry because
they want a car in dowry.

715
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:11,710
Mom hasn't bought
a single saree in five years.

716
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:17,750
Now don't get your mom's
wardrobe into the debate.

717
00:55:18,870 --> 00:55:20,870
By the way, how many sarees
per annum is reasonable?

718
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:23,210
Hey... no wisecracks about mom.

719
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:28,210
We'll study with all our heart,
but not just for grades.

720
00:55:28,870 --> 00:55:33,210
To quote a Wise One,
"Study to be accomplished, not affluent."

721
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:39,500
"Follow excellence. And success
will chase you, pants down!"

722
00:55:40,710 --> 00:55:43,330
Which Wise One says this?
His Holiness Guru Ranchhoddas?

723
00:55:45,370 --> 00:55:46,370
Go rot in the bogs!

724
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Raju, don't stress. We'll top our class.
Nothing is impossible.

725
00:55:51,290 --> 00:55:52,460
Oh, yeah?

726
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:58,250
Shove this back into the tube.

727
00:56:01,290 --> 00:56:02,920
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Raju got onto another train.</i></font>

732
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:27,290
I didn't do it... Raju?

733

<i><font color="#80FFFF">He always blamed others

740
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:07,750
Our Director has unceasingly
served... "Served" means...

741
00:57:07,830 --> 00:57:11,870
Damn the meaning,
I'll memorize it.

742

<i><font color="#80FFFF">Chatur was the introductory speaker

745
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:29,620
Hello? Hold on.
Chatur, call for you.

746
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,420
Please collect the printout.
I'll be right back.

747
00:57:35,210 --> 00:57:37,080
Oh... the things I have to do...

748
00:57:40,670 --> 00:57:43,830
Mr. Dubey, the Director was
remembering you.

749
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,540
- Really?
- Yes. Just now.

750
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:49,290
I'll see him right away.
Give this to Chatur.

751
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:57,500
- Hello? Hello?
- Hello, Mr. Ramalingam?

752
00:57:57,620 --> 00:57:58,540
Yes?

753
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:01,500
I'm calling from the police station.

754
00:58:01,870 --> 00:58:04,710
- Are you from Uganda?
- Yes, sir.

755
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:09,290
- Your life is in danger!
- What? ... How?

756
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:12,210
Listen carefully, or else...

757
00:58:12,830 --> 00:58:17,170
you'll get killed as you step out
of the college gate.

758
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,170
Why? What happened?

759
00:58:19,290 --> 00:58:20,870
<i><font color="#80FFFF">While Chatur was kept engaged,</i></font>

760
00:58:21,290 --> 00:58:25,290
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Rancho altered a few words
in his speech, for e.g...</i></font>

761
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:27,870
<i><font color="#80FFFF">"served" became "screwed".</i></font>

762
00:58:28,710 --> 00:58:30,000
Yes, sir?

763
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:33,080
- Who are you?
- Dubey. Librarian.

764
00:58:35,670 --> 00:58:36,830
I'm permanent staff, sir.

765
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:38,870
Congratulations!

766
00:58:39,290 --> 00:58:42,670
Hold on a moment.
The chief is on the other line.

767
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,000
Excuse me, sir...

768
00:58:53,670 --> 00:58:55,920
Yes... so, where was I?

769
00:58:56,170 --> 00:58:58,580
You said I may die...
outside the gate.

770
00:58:58,710 --> 00:59:05,120
Right. As you get out of the gate,
you'll see a traffic signal.

771
00:59:05,330 --> 00:59:07,370
Traffic signal. Okay.

772
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:13,120
When it turns red,
all the cars will halt.

773
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:14,960
Okay. Then?

774
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:17,080
Then cross the road with great caution.

775
00:59:17,830 --> 00:59:23,080
Because, son, in rush hour
if a car hits you, you're dead.

776
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,830
What nonsense! I know that.

777
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:30,540
You know that? Excellent.
Then you're safe, my boy.

778
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:39,670
From the librarian, Silencer.

779
00:59:39,790 --> 00:59:41,370
You don't call me that,
Chanchad.

780
00:59:47,210 --> 00:59:49,290
Hey, the Director said
he didn't call for me.

781
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:52,330
Who said "called"?
I just said he "remembered" you.

782
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:55,080
Remembered?
Rascals!

783
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:05,290
Distinguished Mr. Chairperson.

784
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:11,870
Chief guest, the Honorable
Minister of Education....

785
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:16,460
respected teachers and friends.

786
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:22,920
ICE has now soared
beyond the stratosphere.

787
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:27,830
The credit goes solely to...

788
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:32,040
Dr. Viru Sahastrabuddhe.
Give him a big hand.

789
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:36,210
Sir, the voice is his
but the words are mine.

790
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:39,210
He's a great guy, really you are.

791
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:48,870
For 32 years, he has
unceasingly screwed students.

792
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:53,790
He means, "served" students.

793
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:56,620
I'm sure his endeavors will continue.

794
01:00:59,290 --> 01:01:04,330
We are astounded at
how one man, in one lifetime,

795
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:07,460
can screw so many, so well.

796
01:01:10,540 --> 01:01:15,830
With rigorous training
he's built up his stamina.

797
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:26,170
He's spent every living minute
just screwing.

798
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:30,500
Let's replicate his methods.

799
01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:39,960
Tomorrow ICE students
will go across the globe.

800
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:46,830
Wherever we go,
we promise to screw.

801
01:01:50,870 --> 01:01:54,080
We'll hoist this screwer's flag
all over the world.

802
01:01:59,670 --> 01:02:04,460
We'll show the world that
our capacity to screw...

803
01:02:04,790 --> 01:02:06,790
cannot be matched by any student...

804
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:10,580
anywhere on the planet.

805
01:02:18,290 --> 01:02:21,330
Mr. Minister. Good evening.

806
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:29,420
You have given this institution
what it sorely needs...

807
01:02:30,170 --> 01:02:31,790
- Booty, funds.
- Bosom.

808
01:02:35,370 --> 01:02:37,540
It's booty, stupid. Bosom means...

809
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:41,000
What nonsense! That's insulting.

810
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:46,170
Everyone has a bosom,
but it remains pocketed.

811
01:02:47,750 --> 01:02:49,750
No one offers it so readily.

812
01:02:53,750 --> 01:02:54,710
Vulgar fellow!

813
01:02:54,870 --> 01:02:56,500
You have generously offered
your bosom...

814
01:02:56,870 --> 01:02:59,960
to this relentless screwer.

815
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:07,170
Now see how he makes it grow.

816
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:11,670
Is this what you teach here, Director?

817
01:03:19,330 --> 01:03:22,750
On this august occasion,
here's a Sanskrit verse...

818
01:03:22,870 --> 01:03:25,870
Listen to this,
the might of his fart in verse.

819
01:03:26,420 --> 01:03:28,960
A good loud fart is honorable.

820
01:03:29,170 --> 01:03:31,540
"Fart"? Go, Silencer.

821
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:34,580
A medium fart is tolerable.

822
01:03:37,870 --> 01:03:41,460
Softer windbreaks are terrible.

823
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:49,330
And the silent ones unbearable.

824
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:02,420
That's what mindless
cramming does to you.

825
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:06,080
Cramming may see you
through four years of college,

826
01:04:06,330 --> 01:04:10,170
but it will "screw" you
for the next 40 years.

827
01:04:11,370 --> 01:04:14,000
He still doesn't get it.

828
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:24,500
"Medium fart is tolerable"...
Unbelievable!

829
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:27,420
You're a poet, Rancho.
How did you think of this?

830
01:04:28,830 --> 01:04:32,250
That was fun.
He didn't know what hit him.

831
01:04:34,750 --> 01:04:38,080
You swines!
What did I ever do to you?

832
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:43,080
Sorry, man.
Don't take it personally.

833
01:04:43,330 --> 01:04:44,580
I will.

834
01:04:45,170 --> 01:04:48,040
Chatur Ramalingam
will never forget this insult.

835
01:04:48,670 --> 01:04:52,540
I'll think of it every minute,
every second of my life.

836
01:04:52,830 --> 01:04:58,210
Sorry, man. That was a demo
for Raju, "Don't cram blindly."

837
01:04:58,540 --> 01:05:00,750
Understand and enjoy
the wonders of Science.

838
01:05:00,870 --> 01:05:03,370
I'm not here to enjoy Science.

839
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:06,420
So you're here to screw Science?

840
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:11,080
Go ahead.
Laugh at my methods.

841
01:05:12,170 --> 01:05:16,500
But one day these methods
will bring me success.

842
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:19,830
That day I'll laugh and you'll cry.

843
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:25,500
You're on the wrong track again.
Don't chase success.

844
01:05:26,370 --> 01:05:28,580
Become a good engineer
and success will chase you.

845
01:05:28,790 --> 01:05:33,420
These ideals don't work
in the real world, Chanchad.

846
01:05:34,250 --> 01:05:38,250
You take your train, l'll take mine.

847
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:42,330
Ten years from now
we'll meet at the same station.

848
01:05:43,210 --> 01:05:48,170
Same day. Same place.
We'll see who's more successful.

849
01:05:48,460 --> 01:05:50,870
You... or me.

850
01:05:51,620 --> 01:05:55,960
Have the balls? C'mon, bet!

851
01:05:56,170 --> 01:05:59,750
lt's a challenge.

852
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:01,960
Watch it!

853
01:06:08,580 --> 01:06:09,500
What's he writing?

854
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:19,420
Don't forget this date.

855
01:06:27,710 --> 01:06:30,290
l'm not used to
such expensive gifts, Suhas.

856
01:06:30,620 --> 01:06:31,870
Get used to them, Pia.

857
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,120
You're gonna be
Suhas Tandon's wife.

858
01:06:34,250 --> 01:06:35,370
Where's the bill, man?

859
01:06:39,830 --> 01:06:40,750
l'll be back.

860
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:52,790
- You changed the speech?
- What?

861
01:06:52,870 --> 01:06:53,750
Don't lie.

862
01:06:54,460 --> 01:06:56,330
Um... Yeah.

863
01:06:56,540 --> 01:06:58,960
- What's your problem with dad?
- l have no problem.

864
01:06:59,420 --> 01:07:02,250
l'm making an inverter
named after him. Look... Oh.

865
01:07:06,580 --> 01:07:08,080
Why're you harassing him?

866
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:10,370
'Cause he runs a factory,
not a college.

867
01:07:10,620 --> 01:07:14,330
Churning out asses.
Like that one.

868
01:07:19,460 --> 01:07:20,500
She destroyed it, man.

869
01:07:23,870 --> 01:07:25,120
How dare you call him an ass?

870
01:07:25,330 --> 01:07:28,620
He is one!
First Engineering, then MBA...

871
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:30,540
then becomes a banker in the USA.

872
01:07:31,460 --> 01:07:33,960
Because it rakes in more money?

873
01:07:34,210 --> 01:07:36,750
Life for him is just
a profit-loss statement.

874
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
He sees profit in you,
so he's with you.

875
01:07:39,330 --> 01:07:43,000
Director's daughter, doctor in the making...
Good for his image!

876
01:07:43,290 --> 01:07:44,580
lt's not you he cares for.

877
01:07:46,830 --> 01:07:48,210
Who do you think you are?

878
01:07:48,460 --> 01:07:50,120
What do you mean
he doesn't care for me?

879
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:54,040
New watch? One moment.

880
01:07:55,250 --> 01:07:57,330
You always need a demo.

881
01:07:58,370 --> 01:07:59,210
Hey, Suhas!

882
01:08:01,370 --> 01:08:02,960
Where were you?
I've been looking for you.

883
01:08:03,370 --> 01:08:05,040
She's looking for her watch.

884
01:08:05,210 --> 01:08:07,000
What? You lost the watch?

885
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:08,420
Never mind. Get another.

886
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:10,000
lt cost 400,000!

887
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:14,000
Mine's just 250,
but keeps the same time.

888
01:08:14,170 --> 01:08:16,500
Shut up! How could
you be so careless, Pia?

889
01:08:16,670 --> 01:08:19,790
This callous attitude is disgusting.
lt's disrespectful!

890
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:22,500
That was a limited
edition watch you just lost.

891
01:08:22,870 --> 01:08:26,330
Now wear your ancient
piece of junk at dinner.

892
01:08:27,670 --> 01:08:29,080
What're you staring at?

893
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:34,790
Here come the tears!
Real mature, Pia.

894
01:08:35,330 --> 01:08:36,580
l can't handle this.

895
01:08:37,420 --> 01:08:39,540
Stop crying and look for it.

896
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:55,960
Find another wrist
for this watch... Ass!

897
01:09:02,370 --> 01:09:05,040
Hey, you're awesome.
Called him an ass to his face.

898
01:09:05,290 --> 01:09:06,170
Get lost!

899
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:08,120
lt's too noisy here.

900
01:09:08,460 --> 01:09:10,370
She's saying "Thank you",
l hear "Get lost".

901
01:09:10,540 --> 01:09:13,370
- l said "Get lost".
- Don't get so uptight.

902
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:16,500
Actually, you never really loved him.

903
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:17,790
What do you mean?

904
01:09:18,170 --> 01:09:22,960
When you see him, do the
winds whisper a melody?

905
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:26,120
Your scarf flies in slow motion?

906
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:28,870
The Moon appears gigantic?

907
01:09:29,370 --> 01:09:31,960
That happens in movies, not in life.

908
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:35,120
Happens in life too,
if you love a person...

909
01:09:35,460 --> 01:09:36,540
not an ass.

910
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:46,580
Hello? What?

911
01:09:47,670 --> 01:09:51,170
Oh, God!
Okay, l'm on my way.

912
01:09:54,370 --> 01:09:56,290
You're a medical student, right?
Need your help.

913
01:09:56,370 --> 01:09:58,080

914
01:09:58,580 --> 01:10:01,790
Please come with me.
What's that oath you doctors take?

915
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,670
You'll never deny a patient help...
The Hippocratic Oath.

916
01:10:05,330 --> 01:10:07,170
Please help me,
it's an emergency.

917
01:10:11,670 --> 01:10:14,830
You gatecrash my sister's wedding,

918
01:10:15,210 --> 01:10:17,580

BP pills because of you...

919
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:19,670

920
01:10:20,790 --> 01:10:22,000
Unbelievable!

- Where's Raju, ma'am?
- Gone to get a cab.

923
01:10:34,170 --> 01:10:35,670
Called the ambulance
two hours ago.

924
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:38,540
ln this country,
pizza reaches in 30 minutes...

925
01:10:38,750 --> 01:10:39,670
but an ambulance...

926
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:42,210
He needs hospitalization.
Urgently!

927
01:10:56,330 --> 01:10:57,370
Hey, stop!

928
01:10:59,670 --> 01:11:01,920
Move, it's an emergency!

929
01:11:03,540 --> 01:11:07,710
Move... move...

930
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:13,920
Doctor, emergency!

931
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:16,420
That's the patient.

932
01:11:22,370 --> 01:11:24,460
Keep this. Hey, here's Raju.

933
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:26,870
What the hell!
You brought dad on the scooter.

934
01:11:28,750 --> 01:11:30,080
Should l've sent him by courier?

935
01:11:30,460 --> 01:11:33,290
No wisecracks on dads profession!
Where is he?

936
01:11:33,870 --> 01:11:35,710
Go ask the doctor.

937
01:11:36,670 --> 01:11:39,920
Close call, Pia. A little delay,
we'd have lost him.

938
01:11:40,290 --> 01:11:41,830
Glad you didn't wait for an ambulance
and got him on the scooter.

939
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:44,750
Call me if there's a problem.

940
01:11:53,870 --> 01:11:56,870
Rancho! Thank you...

941
01:11:58,620 --> 01:12:01,670
Thanking your buddies!
Silencer teaching you manners?

942
01:12:02,870 --> 01:12:05,960
Didn't he teach you,
"A friend is man's greatest bosom?"

943
01:12:07,750 --> 01:12:10,670
Go on now.
You have an exam tomorrow.

944
01:12:11,250 --> 01:12:14,500
Exams we have many...
Dad mostly just one!

945
01:12:16,170 --> 01:12:18,460
We won't budge from here
without the Postmaster.

946
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:20,040
Don't worry!

947
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:31,250
Rancho, forgive me.
l was scared.

948
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:33,620
lt's okay. Quiet, now.

949
01:12:36,170 --> 01:12:38,330
Please forgive me.

950
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:48,960
lt's okay, calm down.
Go see your dad.

951
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:50,870
And don't go
with that weepy face.

952
01:12:57,170 --> 01:12:58,170
Thanks, buddy.

953
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:14,540
Natty scooter. Saved a life.
How much does it cost?

954
01:13:14,830 --> 01:13:17,170
Pour some mint sauce on it.
l'll tell you.

955
01:13:19,790 --> 01:13:21,710
Hey, happy lndependence Day.

956
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:23,670
Today isn't lndependence Day.

957
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,170
For you it is! Now you're free
to wear your mom's watch.

958
01:13:27,790 --> 01:13:30,540
No ass can say it's an
ancient piece of junk.

959
01:13:32,830 --> 01:13:33,710
Hey.

960
01:13:35,670 --> 01:13:37,670
How do you know
it was my mom's watch?

961
01:13:39,420 --> 01:13:41,870
At your sister's wedding,
you wore sparkling new clothes.

962
01:13:42,670 --> 01:13:43,870
Only the watch was old.

963
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:45,420
What could that mean?

964
01:13:47,710 --> 01:13:50,870
You really missed your mom
that day, didn't you?

965
01:13:53,710 --> 01:13:54,750
Yes.

966
01:13:55,790 --> 01:13:57,540
Your mom must've been
really beautiful.

967
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:02,250
Yes. How do you know?

968
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:03,500

Go.

1023
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:26,460
- Sorry, we're late.
- It was an emergency.

1024
01:19:32,330 --> 01:19:33,460
Settle down there.

Sir, they're still writing.

Hello. Time up.

Please, five minutes.
We started half an hour late.

the answer sheets.

Done, sir.

<i><font color="#80FFFF">let alone the Almighty.</i></font>

1054
01:21:23,290 --> 01:21:25,370
Check from the bottom.

1055
01:21:26,370 --> 01:21:28,500
You are... last.

1056
01:21:30,210 --> 01:21:31,120
And you?

1057
01:21:33,170 --> 01:21:34,620
Second last.

1058
01:21:36,210 --> 01:21:37,290
Rancho?

1059
01:21:41,710 --> 01:21:42,790
Not there.

1060
01:21:44,170 --> 01:21:45,210
<i><font color="#80FFFF">My heart sank.</i></font>

1061
01:21:45,790 --> 01:21:50,210

but 'cause our friend flunked.</i></font>

1062
01:21:52,670 --> 01:21:56,370
There's a mistake.
It's not possible. It's injustice.

1063
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:03,420
What's Silencer howling about?

1064
01:22:04,040 --> 01:22:05,000
He got the second rank.

1065
01:22:07,330 --> 01:22:08,370
Who's first?

1066
01:22:09,580 --> 01:22:10,710
Rancho.

1067
01:22:13,580 --> 01:22:14,460
Rancho?

1068
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:17,750
Move aside.

1069
01:22:22,540 --> 01:22:24,830
<i><font color="#80FFFF">We learned a lesson

1072
01:22:37,370 --> 01:22:41,250
Ranchhoddas Chanchad.
Front row. Right of the Director.

1073
01:22:41,870 --> 01:22:44,170
Uday Sinha. Second row. Third seat.

1074
01:22:45,080 --> 01:22:48,330
Alok Mittal. Second row. Fifth seat.

1075
01:22:50,120 --> 01:22:52,790
Sahili Rao. Third row...

1076
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:55,420
Sir, why this seating
according to rank?

1077
01:22:56,580 --> 01:22:57,830
Any problem with that?

1078
01:22:57,960 --> 01:23:02,080
Yes, this grading system is
like a caste system.

1079
01:23:02,540 --> 01:23:05,710
A-graders: Masters.
C-graders: Slaves

1080
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:09,290
- It's not nice, sir.
- You have a better idea?

1081
01:23:09,870 --> 01:23:14,040
Yes. Results should not be
displayed at all.

1082
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:18,580
Why publicise someone's flaws?

1083
01:23:18,870 --> 01:23:23,920
If your iron count is low,
will the doctor prescribe tonic...

1084
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:25,500
or air your report on TV?

1085
01:23:26,330 --> 01:23:27,420
You see, sir?

1086
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,790
So, basically, what you are saying is...

1087
01:23:30,290 --> 01:23:32,080
I should personally go to
each student's room

1088
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:34,210
and whisper in his ears...

1089
01:23:35,250 --> 01:23:37,670
"You have come first",
"You're second."

1090
01:23:37,750 --> 01:23:39,330
"Oh, I'm so sorry,
you have failed."

1091
01:23:42,330 --> 01:23:46,710
No, sir, I mean
grades create a divide.

1092
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:51,000
I've topped, so I'm next to you.

1093
01:23:51,250 --> 01:23:53,670
My pals came last,
they're in the back corner.

1094
01:23:53,830 --> 01:23:55,370
At least they're in the corner.

1095
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:57,920
More time with you,
and they'll be out of the photo.

1096
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:01,040
They will neither pass,
nor get a job.

1097
01:24:01,830 --> 01:24:05,710
They'll get jobs, sir.
There must be some firm that...

1098
01:24:06,170 --> 01:24:08,000
prefers humans to machines.

1099
01:24:09,870 --> 01:24:11,710
They'll get jobs. I guarantee.

1100
01:24:13,710 --> 01:24:16,040
You guarantee it!

1101
01:24:16,250 --> 01:24:17,790
Bet, sir?

1102
01:24:21,170 --> 01:24:22,500
- Govind.
- Yes, sir?

1103
01:24:26,670 --> 01:24:29,960
Even if one of them gets a job
in campus interviews...

1104
01:24:31,170 --> 01:24:32,370
shave off my moustache.

1105
01:24:34,210 --> 01:24:36,000
Sir!

1106
01:24:36,290 --> 01:24:39,330
- Happy?
- Smile, please.

1107
01:24:40,620 --> 01:24:41,580
Happy, sir.

1108
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:49,540
Jackass!
Honking to hide your tooting.

1109
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:52,790
Septic tank! Popping pills again?

1110
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:55,710
I didn't do it... Raju?

1111
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:57,540
This is a familiar stink.

1112
01:24:57,620 --> 01:25:00,670
He's the sole cause for global warming.

1113
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:28,540
Toss me your wallet.
I'll buy pants.

1114
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:33,290
- Take Chatur's suit instead.
- Don't you touch my suit.

1115
01:25:34,460 --> 01:25:36,250
Rancho'll recognize you
even in underwear.

1116
01:25:36,420 --> 01:25:40,420
- Where's this?
- If I could read, would I sell peanuts?

1117
01:25:40,620 --> 01:25:43,210
- He can't read.
- But he can speak.

1118
01:25:43,420 --> 01:25:47,420
Wait. Do you know a
Ranchhoddas Chanchad?

1119
01:25:47,620 --> 01:25:49,370
Yes, he lives there.

1120
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:55,370
<i><font color=Lime>♪ Free as the wind was he ♪</i></font>

1121

1122

1123

1124
01:26:09,330 --> 01:26:12,000
- Chatur, your pills.
- Thanks. Where were they?

1125
01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:14,580
- In the pocket.
- Hey, my pants!

1126
01:26:14,710 --> 01:26:16,710
Karl Marx says to share all resources.

1127
01:26:18,290 --> 01:26:20,250
Hey, you'll give people ideas.

1128
01:26:21,790 --> 01:26:22,830
I want it now!

1129
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:39,210
What happened?

1130
01:26:41,330 --> 01:26:42,540
Rancho's father.

1131
01:26:46,040 --> 01:26:48,790
Excuse me, where is Ranchhoddas?

1132
01:26:49,620 --> 01:26:52,040
- There he is.
- Thank you.

1133
01:27:15,210 --> 01:27:18,370
- Rancho...
- Yes?

1134
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:22,670
Sorry. We're looking for
Ranchhoddas Shyamaldas Chanchad.

1135
01:27:23,670 --> 01:27:25,000
I am Ranchhoddas.

1136
01:27:25,580 --> 01:27:29,500
No, I mean...
"Ranchhoddas Shyamaldas Chanchad".

1137
01:27:30,920 --> 01:27:33,500
Ranchhoddas Shyamaldas Chanchad.
That's me.

1138
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:41,250
Ranchhoddas, take care, son.

1139
01:28:00,540 --> 01:28:02,670
"Ranchhoddas Chanchad."

1140
01:28:09,830 --> 01:28:10,870
Raju.

1141
01:28:36,120 --> 01:28:39,750
I'll be in the Guinness Book for
driving Delhi-Shimla in underwear.

1142
01:28:39,870 --> 01:28:41,000
That too, for the wrong guy!

1143
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:45,460
Same name, same degree,
same photo, but a different guy.

1144
01:28:46,040 --> 01:28:47,500
What's going on?

1145
01:28:48,210 --> 01:28:50,870
How did Silencer get
Rancho's address?

1146
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:52,920
Good point!

1147
01:28:54,330 --> 01:28:55,750
Hey, Chatur, come here.

1148
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:05,540
How dare you open this?
I got this from San Francisco.

1149
01:29:05,580 --> 01:29:07,120
Handmade biscuits.

1150
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:11,210
Specially for Mr. Phunsukh Wangdu.

1151
01:29:11,460 --> 01:29:13,620
Phunsukh Bangdu?
Who's that?

1152
01:29:13,710 --> 01:29:18,330
Not Bangdu. Wangdu. 'W'.
Phunsukh Wangdu.

1153
01:29:18,420 --> 01:29:21,250
Do you know who that is?
He's a great scientist.

1154
01:29:21,330 --> 01:29:24,040
400 patents.
The world wants him.

1155
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:28,540
Took me a year to get an appointment.

1156
01:29:29,290 --> 01:29:34,750
Once he signs the deal with
my company, I'll be huge!

1157
01:29:34,830 --> 01:29:39,000
Forget Wangdu.
How'd you get Rancho's address?

1158
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:41,080
You should be thanking
Phunsukh Wangdu.

1159
01:29:41,460 --> 01:29:45,040
He led me to Rancho, see this.

1160
01:29:47,210 --> 01:29:51,670
My secretary was here to fix
an appointment with Wangdu.

1161
01:29:51,750 --> 01:29:56,080
She didn't get the appointment.
But I found Rancho.

1162
01:29:56,210 --> 01:30:01,830
I checked the Shimla directory
and found Rancho's name.

1163
01:30:01,870 --> 01:30:03,540
What happened to his face?

1164
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:06,250
Plastic surgery in honor of your visit?

1165
01:30:10,620 --> 01:30:12,460
Only one man has the answer.

1166
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:17,710
Sorry, Papa,
I couldn't fulfill your last wish.

1167
01:30:19,170 --> 01:30:22,960
You kept asking me
to take you on pilgrimage.

1168
01:30:23,870 --> 01:30:26,370
But I waited
for the highway tender.

1169
01:30:27,870 --> 01:30:32,330
There the tender opened,
here you closed your eyes.

1170
01:30:36,420 --> 01:30:40,920
I am so sorry, Papa.
I could not be a good son...

1171
01:30:41,080 --> 01:30:42,420
Wrong.

1172
01:30:42,870 --> 01:30:45,710
You're an engineer.
Your degree's on the wall!

1173
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:47,290
You were a very good son.

1174
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:54,670
How dare you barge in?
I'll have you arrested.

1175
01:30:54,830 --> 01:30:58,040
No, you'll be arrested.
We've made enquiries.

1176
01:30:58,330 --> 01:31:01,420
You use the degree
to clinch contracts.

1177
01:31:01,870 --> 01:31:05,120
It's our friend's degree.
How did you get it?

1178
01:31:20,710 --> 01:31:22,120
This is a 150 acre estate.

1179
01:31:22,540 --> 01:31:25,750
If I shoot and bury you,
no one would even notice.

1180
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:27,000
Get the point?

1181
01:31:28,330 --> 01:31:29,210
Now get lost!

1182
01:31:34,790 --> 01:31:39,080
I'm taking Papa's ashes to the
sacred river. Can take yours too.

1183
01:31:46,540 --> 01:31:48,120
Grab Papa!

1184
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:52,170
Here, here.

1185
01:31:56,290 --> 01:31:57,330
Let go of Papa!

1186
01:32:00,250 --> 01:32:03,080
Tell the truth or Papa is flushed!

1187
01:32:03,210 --> 01:32:06,120
- Hand over Papa!
- Papa goes to the sacred sewer.

1188
01:32:06,830 --> 01:32:10,170
- Get Papa out of the potty.
- You pull trigger, I pull flush.

1189
01:32:10,290 --> 01:32:11,620
I'll count to three.

1190
01:32:11,670 --> 01:32:15,420
Wanna shoot us?
Raju, scatter the ashes.

1191
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:19,080
One.

1192
01:32:19,250 --> 01:32:24,000
Take us down,
and Papa's down the drain.

1193
01:32:25,250 --> 01:32:26,170
Two.

1194
01:32:26,250 --> 01:32:28,710
Then grope for him in the gutter.

1195
01:32:28,830 --> 01:32:29,710
What is it, Raju?

1196
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:33,620
We've got the wrong urn.
It's empty!

1197
01:32:34,500 --> 01:32:35,420
Empty?

1198
01:32:36,790 --> 01:32:40,250
- Empty?
- We'll empty it out!

1199
01:32:40,370 --> 01:32:41,250
No, no!

1200
01:32:41,330 --> 01:32:44,210
We'll empty it out!

1201
01:32:44,290 --> 01:32:46,750
No... hands up!

1202
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:52,080
Who are you?

1203
01:32:52,250 --> 01:32:53,370
I am Rancho.

1204
01:32:54,670 --> 01:32:57,120
I swear on Papa, it's true.

1205
01:32:57,330 --> 01:32:59,120
I am Rancho!
That was Chhote.

1206
01:33:00,250 --> 01:33:01,080
Chhote?

1207
01:33:02,460 --> 01:33:07,460
He was our gardener's son, Chhote.

1208
01:33:09,420 --> 01:33:12,250
He stayed on with us
after he was orphaned.

1209
01:33:14,460 --> 01:33:22,290
Did odd jobs around the house,
ran errands.

1210
01:33:23,710 --> 01:33:25,000
He had a passion for learning.

1211
01:33:28,250 --> 01:33:30,920
<i><font color="#80FFFF">He'd wear my old uniform
and slip into school.</i></font>

1212
01:33:32,920 --> 01:33:35,870
<i><font color="#80FFFF">And attend any class he liked.
It suited me.</i></font>

1213
01:33:36,830 --> 01:33:42,920
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I made him do my homework,
take my exams.</i></font>

1214
01:33:43,420 --> 01:33:46,460
<i><font color="#80FFFF">It was going well, till one day...</i></font>

1215
01:33:46,870 --> 01:33:51,460
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Our teacher saw a sixth grader
doing tenth grade math.</i></font>

1216
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:53,040
Which grade are you in, son?

1217
01:33:54,250 --> 01:33:55,460
What's your name?

1218
01:33:56,420 --> 01:33:57,370
<i><font color="#80FFFF">We got caught.</i></font>

1219
01:33:58,540 --> 01:33:59,920
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Papa was a powerful man, so...</i></font>

1220
01:34:00,040 --> 01:34:03,540
<i><font color="#80FFFF">our teacher alerted him
before going to the Principal.</i></font>

1221
01:34:04,040 --> 01:34:08,000
You started it, you will finish it.

1222
01:34:10,710 --> 01:34:13,500
People pretend to show me respect...

1223
01:34:14,210 --> 01:34:16,420
But behind my back...

1224
01:34:17,370 --> 01:34:19,000
mock me as an illiterate.

1225
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,040
I won't let that happen to my son.

1226
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:27,460
This boy wants to study.
I want just a degree.

1227
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,960
Let the game go on.

1228
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:32,580
Make this kid an engineer,

1229
01:34:33,830 --> 01:34:39,210
and I'll have a degree
in my son's name on that wall.

1230
01:34:39,540 --> 01:34:43,540
I went to London for four years,
he went to college as me.

1231
01:34:45,210 --> 01:34:51,370
He'd promised to cut contact with all
after getting the degree.

1232
01:34:53,500 --> 01:35:01,750
But he always said:
"Two idiots will come looking for me."

1233
01:35:06,710 --> 01:35:08,370
He really misses you both.

1234
01:35:10,790 --> 01:35:14,750
I'll give you his address,
go to him.

1235
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:21,580
But keep my secret, please.

1236
01:35:23,460 --> 01:35:24,620
What secret?

1237
01:35:37,960 --> 01:35:41,460
You got the wrong urn, sir.
Papa is in here.

1238
01:35:43,670 --> 01:35:46,250
What the hell is going on?
Who was that gun guy?

1239
01:35:46,290 --> 01:35:49,830
Complicated story.
Without subtitles. Not for you.

1240
01:35:49,870 --> 01:35:52,170
- Ignore it.
- Where're we going?

1241
01:35:53,500 --> 01:35:54,420
Ladakh.

1242
01:35:54,460 --> 01:35:55,830
Ladakh! Why?

1243
01:35:56,540 --> 01:35:57,500
To meet Rancho.

1244
01:35:57,670 --> 01:36:00,670
What's he doing in Ladakh?

1245
01:36:00,710 --> 01:36:04,290
No clue. We have
the address of a school.

1246
01:36:04,540 --> 01:36:07,620
School teacher!

1247
01:36:08,500 --> 01:36:11,920
I'm Vice President of
Rockledge Corporation, and he...

1248
01:36:12,330 --> 01:36:14,620
A for Apple, B for Ball...

1249
01:36:14,790 --> 01:36:16,000
D for Donkey.

1250
01:36:16,710 --> 01:36:21,670
Next week I sign a huge deal
with Phunsukh Wangdu.

1251
01:36:21,830 --> 01:36:24,870
And he... A for Apple, B for Ball...

1252
01:36:28,580 --> 01:36:31,000
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Today my respect
for that idiot shot up.</i></font>

1253
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:34,250
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Most of us went to college
just for a degree.</i></font>

1254
01:36:34,830 --> 01:36:39,040
<i><font color="#80FFFF">No degree meant
no plum job, no pretty wife...</i></font>

1255
01:36:39,330 --> 01:36:41,920
<i><font color="#80FFFF">no credit card, no social status.</i></font>

1256
01:36:42,580 --> 01:36:44,420
<i><font color="#80FFFF">None of this mattered to him.</i></font>

1257
01:36:44,540 --> 01:36:46,370
<i><font color="#80FFFF">He was in college
for the joy of learning.</i></font>

1258
01:36:46,870 --> 01:36:50,170
<i><font color="#80FFFF">He never cared
if he was first or last.</i></font>

1259
01:36:50,750 --> 01:36:53,080
Who was the first man
on the Moon?

1260
01:36:53,330 --> 01:36:54,580
Neil Armstrong, sir.

1261
01:36:54,620 --> 01:36:56,790
Obviously, it is Neil Armstrong.
We all know it.

1262
01:36:56,960 --> 01:36:58,210
Who was the second?

1263
01:36:58,710 --> 01:37:00,330
Don't waste your time.
It's not important.

1264
01:37:00,790 --> 01:37:03,290
Nobody remembers the man
who ever came second.

1265
01:37:04,420 --> 01:37:09,870
Soon, 26 companies
will be here with job offers.

1266
01:37:10,330 --> 01:37:16,000
You'll have a job
even before your final exam.

1267
01:37:16,750 --> 01:37:18,620
This is your last lap, my friends.

1268
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:21,170
Put the pedal to the metal.
Step on the gas.

1269
01:37:21,250 --> 01:37:23,250
Go out there and make history!

1270
01:37:26,670 --> 01:37:27,920
Any questions?

1271
01:37:30,420 --> 01:37:31,330
Yes?

1272
01:37:32,670 --> 01:37:36,290
Sir, suppose a student gets a job...

1273
01:37:36,670 --> 01:37:43,960
but narrowly fails the final exam,
will he still have the job?

1274
01:37:44,460 --> 01:37:45,790
Very good question.

1275
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:51,420
Anyone else
with the same question?

1276
01:37:53,330 --> 01:37:54,670
As expected.

1277
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:00,120
Please come on stage.
Give them a big hand.

1278
01:38:11,290 --> 01:38:13,580
For the last four years...

1279
01:38:13,620 --> 01:38:16,580
they've been our most
consistent students.

1280
01:38:16,710 --> 01:38:20,040
Consistently last in every exam.

1281
01:38:20,870 --> 01:38:22,250
Come my geniuses, come.

1282
01:38:23,710 --> 01:38:29,330
Their brains will fetch
a handsome price.

1283
01:38:30,040 --> 01:38:33,080
'Cause they're completely unused.

1284
01:38:35,580 --> 01:38:36,830
And to answer their question:

1285
01:38:37,210 --> 01:38:40,540
The exam won't affect their jobs.

1286
01:38:41,330 --> 01:38:44,870
Because no company
will hire them anyway!

1287
01:38:45,710 --> 01:38:48,750
They're so unique,
their names will be written in gold:

1288
01:38:49,040 --> 01:38:51,960
'Farhanitrate' and 'Prerajulization'

1289
01:38:52,040 --> 01:38:53,540
Give them a big hand,
please, everybody.

1290
01:39:02,620 --> 01:39:07,500
He screwed us!

1291
01:39:07,620 --> 01:39:09,580
In front of everyone.

1292
01:39:10,710 --> 01:39:15,830
God, I'll give up meat,
light a 1000 incense sticks.

1293
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:17,710
Do me just one favor.

1294
01:39:17,790 --> 01:39:20,250
Delete Virus!

1295
01:39:21,870 --> 01:39:23,870
Burn him in hell.

1296
01:39:25,250 --> 01:39:29,080
Fry Virus-nuggets in bubbling oil.

1297
01:39:29,830 --> 01:39:32,710
You think God is a contract killer?

1298
01:39:33,330 --> 01:39:34,620
You shut up!

1299
01:39:35,330 --> 01:39:38,250
You're in the center
of the photo every year.

1300
01:39:38,290 --> 01:39:40,250
We're rotting in the corner.

1301
01:39:41,290 --> 01:39:44,330
This year we may fall out
of the photo altogether.

1302
01:39:46,790 --> 01:39:48,620
- Know why I come first?
- Why?

1303
01:39:49,040 --> 01:39:50,750
Because I love machines.

1304
01:39:51,540 --> 01:39:53,370
Engineering is my passion.

1305
01:39:54,420 --> 01:39:55,670
Know your passion?

1306
01:39:58,500 --> 01:40:00,210
- That's my bag.
- Be quiet.

1307
01:40:01,170 --> 01:40:02,500
What're you up to?

1308
01:40:04,920 --> 01:40:07,080
This... is your passion.

1309
01:40:08,330 --> 01:40:09,750
Go post this letter.

1310
01:40:10,120 --> 01:40:11,460
What letter?

1311
01:40:14,170 --> 01:40:18,460
5 years ago he wrote this for
his favorite wildlife photographer.

1312
01:40:19,210 --> 01:40:22,000
- Andre...
- Istvan.

1313
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:26,580
He wanted to train with him
in Hungary.

1314
01:40:27,500 --> 01:40:30,830
But in fear of his dad, the Fuhrer,
never posted it.

1315
01:40:32,540 --> 01:40:36,120
Quit Engineering, marry Photography.

1316
01:40:37,080 --> 01:40:39,080
Follow your talent.

1317
01:40:42,210 --> 01:40:46,250
If Michael Jackson's dad
forced him to be a boxer...

1318
01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:50,580
and Mohammad Ali's dad
pushed him to be a singer...

1319
01:40:51,290 --> 01:40:52,620
imagine the disaster.

1320
01:40:54,670 --> 01:40:57,210
Do you get it?

1321
01:41:00,750 --> 01:41:04,080
Idiot! Loves Photography,
but is marrying machines.

1322
01:41:08,710 --> 01:41:10,120
Your Holiness Guru Ranchhoddas!

1323
01:41:11,420 --> 01:41:15,580
Engineering is
my wife and mistress both.

1324
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,540
- But I still fail. Why?
- Explain.

1325
01:41:20,670 --> 01:41:23,040
'Cause you're a coward,
scared of the future.

1326
01:41:24,750 --> 01:41:29,250
Look at this,
more holy rings than fingers.

1327
01:41:29,790 --> 01:41:33,000
One ring per fear,
exam, sis' dowry, job.

1328
01:41:34,460 --> 01:41:38,250
With such fear of tomorrow,
how'll you live today?

1329
01:41:39,080 --> 01:41:40,750
How'll you focus on studies?

1330
01:41:42,080 --> 01:41:45,210
Strange buddies! One lives
in fear, the other in pretense.

1331
01:41:46,170 --> 01:41:51,540
You live in both, fear and pretense.

1332
01:41:51,750 --> 01:41:57,830
You're scared to tell Pia you love her...
so you pretend you don't.

1333
01:42:00,330 --> 01:42:02,420
What rubbish!

1334
01:42:03,040 --> 01:42:07,120
Easy to offer free advice,
tough to follow it.

1335
01:42:07,210 --> 01:42:10,460
Have the guts? Go confess to Pia.

1336
01:42:10,920 --> 01:42:14,790
- There's no connection!
- Deep connection, Your Holiness.

1337
01:42:14,870 --> 01:42:20,370
Listen, if you confess to Pia...

1338
01:42:20,790 --> 01:42:25,250
I'll tell Dad, "No Engineering,
I'm marrying Photography."

1339
01:42:26,420 --> 01:42:30,080
And I'll dump my rings
before the job interview.

1340
01:42:30,500 --> 01:42:31,580
Deal?

1341
01:42:33,670 --> 01:42:35,460
Have the guts?

1342
01:42:35,580 --> 01:42:37,870
His Holiness is speechless.

1343
01:42:43,920 --> 01:42:44,790
Let's go.

1344
01:42:49,830 --> 01:42:51,170
- Follow me.
- Where?

1345
01:42:56,790 --> 01:42:58,330
Let's go.

1346
01:42:58,750 --> 01:43:01,870
Hey, Virus! I'm anti-Virus.

1347
01:43:01,960 --> 01:43:03,460
Hope no dog here.

1348
01:43:03,580 --> 01:43:06,000
Cowards! Let's go.

1349
01:43:06,120 --> 01:43:09,830
If any danger,
I'll give the Virus alert.

1350
01:43:22,080 --> 01:43:23,670
Beware, Virus inside.

1351
01:43:44,250 --> 01:43:45,460
Need background music?

1352
01:43:45,670 --> 01:43:46,670
- Pia.
- Who's it?

1353
01:43:49,420 --> 01:43:53,120
Don't yell! It's me, Rancho.

1354
01:43:55,040 --> 01:43:58,460
Just listen for a moment,
then I'm gone.

1355
01:43:58,750 --> 01:44:01,170
Say not a word...

1356
01:44:01,500 --> 01:44:02,500
- Pia...
- Yes?

1357
01:44:04,620 --> 01:44:07,960
Those 22 minutes with you
on the scooter

1358
01:44:08,790 --> 01:44:13,370
were the most enchanting
22 minutes of my life.

1359
01:44:17,790 --> 01:44:23,210
I could spend an eternity
with you on the scooter.

1360
01:44:23,330 --> 01:44:24,210
Wow!

1361
01:44:25,460 --> 01:44:28,580
... and time stands still.

1362
01:44:29,620 --> 01:44:37,080
Every night you ride into my dreams
on your scooter, dressed as a bride.

1363
01:44:40,040 --> 01:44:42,370
Instead of a veil,
you lift your helmet...

1364
01:44:45,830 --> 01:44:48,790
and come close to kiss me.

1365
01:44:51,870 --> 01:44:54,170
But that kiss doesn't happen.

1366
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:55,920
Why?

1367
01:44:56,250 --> 01:44:59,420
Because the noses collide,
and I wake up.

1368
01:45:00,500 --> 01:45:02,170
The noses never collide, stupid!

1369
01:45:07,290 --> 01:45:10,370
I'm sorry,
I thought you were Pia.

1370
01:45:10,960 --> 01:45:11,920
I wish I was.

1371
01:45:12,210 --> 01:45:14,000
Sis, why did you interrupt?

1372
01:45:14,460 --> 01:45:16,290
It took him four years to say this.

1373
01:45:16,500 --> 01:45:19,540
Pia, kiss him.
Show that noses don't collide.

1374
01:45:19,620 --> 01:45:22,870
You have my permission,
kiss him... He's so cute!

1375
01:45:23,420 --> 01:45:25,080
- Who's this?
- My sister.

1376
01:45:26,080 --> 01:45:27,120
Who're you?

1377
01:45:36,790 --> 01:45:40,540
When you were talking,
he kicked. First time!

1378
01:45:40,580 --> 01:45:44,420
He? How do you know
it's a "he" or "she"?

1379
01:45:44,710 --> 01:45:48,750
Papa asked the astrologer
If we'd get an engineer or a doctor.

1380
01:45:49,710 --> 01:45:50,620
Meaning?

1381
01:45:50,790 --> 01:45:53,670
Boy becomes an engineer,
girl a doctor.

1382
01:45:54,460 --> 01:45:59,960
Champ, better stay inside.
Out here's a circus.

1383
01:46:01,040 --> 01:46:04,790
Your grandpa is the ringmaster.
He'll crack his whip,

1384
01:46:04,920 --> 01:46:10,330
"Run! Life is a race.
Be an engineer."

1385
01:46:11,170 --> 01:46:16,420
But you follow your heart.
If grandpa scares you...

1386
01:46:17,210 --> 01:46:20,580
put your hand on your heart
and say, "All is well".

1387
01:46:21,460 --> 01:46:22,290
He kicked.

1388
01:46:24,250 --> 01:46:25,330
Say it again.

1389
01:46:26,540 --> 01:46:28,170
All is well.

1390
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:30,750
Kicked again.

1391
01:46:32,370 --> 01:46:35,370
- Once more.
- All is well.

1392
01:46:39,870 --> 01:46:44,040
All is well.

1393
01:46:44,580 --> 01:46:45,580
Who is it?

1394
01:46:46,420 --> 01:46:47,420
Go.

1395
01:46:48,080 --> 01:46:53,120
You sent hate-mail to Dad,
here's pee-mail for you.

1396
01:46:53,210 --> 01:46:57,670
Enjoy the pee-mail, happy reading!

1397
01:47:04,120 --> 01:47:06,870
- Who is it?
- Your future son-in-law.

1398
01:47:07,120 --> 01:47:08,620
And the wedding party.

1399
01:47:09,460 --> 01:47:10,540
Rastogi!

1400
01:47:12,960 --> 01:47:14,790
Security, that way.

1401
01:47:44,370 --> 01:47:48,120
So you all have already learned
about the simple pendulum.

1402
01:47:48,830 --> 01:47:52,750
Now let's get down to the advanced
study about compound pendulum.

1403
01:47:54,170 --> 01:47:58,170
It's an irregular object
oscillating about its own axis.

1404
01:47:58,580 --> 01:47:59,670
Let me demonstrate to you.

1405
01:48:00,250 --> 01:48:02,210
- What's this?
- Pencil.

1406
01:48:02,500 --> 01:48:03,960
- What's inside?
- Lead.

1407
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,170
Good. Lead is the axis to this pencil.

1408
01:48:06,670 --> 01:48:09,670
Even you can be a compound
pendulum, if you oscillate about...

1409
01:48:17,290 --> 01:48:19,920
- Where is Raju Rastogi?
- Present, sir.

1410
01:48:27,370 --> 01:48:29,290
Hi. Everybody is here.

1411
01:48:30,960 --> 01:48:32,040
Good morning, sir.

1412
01:48:32,960 --> 01:48:34,170
Where were you last night?

1413
01:48:34,710 --> 01:48:37,790
- Studying all night, sir.
- Studying?

1414
01:48:37,960 --> 01:48:38,920
Really?

1415
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:42,040
Hasn't slept two nights,
that's why he looks scruffy.

1416
01:48:42,120 --> 01:48:43,040
Not slept?

1417
01:48:43,210 --> 01:48:44,250
What did you study?

1418
01:48:45,330 --> 01:48:49,370
Induction motor, sir.
The whole chapter.

1419
01:48:49,670 --> 01:48:50,580
Whole chapter?

1420
01:48:50,790 --> 01:48:52,830
In that case, Mr. Raju Rastogi...

1421
01:48:52,920 --> 01:48:53,830
Yes, sir!

1422
01:48:53,960 --> 01:48:56,620
Can you tell us how an
induction motor starts?

1423
01:49:04,710 --> 01:49:05,620
Stop it!

1424
01:49:13,290 --> 01:49:15,580
Sir, rum.

1425
01:49:17,460 --> 01:49:18,500
Mr. Rastogi!

1426
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:21,330
Let's have a cup of tea
in my office.

1427
01:49:27,420 --> 01:49:28,370
Sir?

1428
01:49:29,540 --> 01:49:30,460
Close the door.

1429
01:49:35,710 --> 01:49:36,790
Can you type?

1430
01:49:38,080 --> 01:49:38,960
Yes, sir.

1431
01:49:39,170 --> 01:49:40,620
Will you type a letter for me?

1432
01:49:42,710 --> 01:49:43,790
Definitely, sir.

1433
01:49:44,080 --> 01:49:45,040
Come, sit.

1434
01:49:45,790 --> 01:49:46,830
Sir, I'm sorry, sir...

1435
01:49:49,210 --> 01:49:50,170
Please type.

1436
01:49:51,830 --> 01:49:52,670
"Dear Sir..."

1437
01:49:53,620 --> 01:49:57,040
"It is my painful duty to inform you..."

1438
01:49:58,330 --> 01:50:01,040
"that your son is rusticated..."

1439
01:50:01,790 --> 01:50:04,370
No, sorry, delete that.
Go back.

1440
01:50:05,080 --> 01:50:09,170
"Your son, Mr. Raju Rastogi..."

1441
01:50:10,250 --> 01:50:14,420
"is rusticated from the
Imperial College of Engineering."

1442
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:16,420
Come on, type.

1443
01:50:23,870 --> 01:50:25,580
It'll kill my dad, sir.

1444
01:50:25,750 --> 01:50:27,540
- Please type.
- Sir, please, sir.

1445
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:31,960
"My decision is final and irrevocable."

1446
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:39,170
He lives just to see me
become an engineer.

1447
01:50:39,210 --> 01:50:43,500
Should've thought of that
before peeing on my door.

1448
01:50:43,620 --> 01:50:48,080
Sir, give me one chance... please.

1449
01:50:53,670 --> 01:50:57,080
Okay, remove your name
from the letter...

1450
01:50:58,420 --> 01:51:00,580
and put in Rancho's.

1451
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,210
I know he was with you last night.

1452
01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:09,120
Be my witness and I'll spare you.

1453
01:51:12,670 --> 01:51:16,710
You have 7 and a half minutes to think.

Rancho, watch that monitor.

1465
01:53:02,500 --> 01:53:03,330
Raju.

1466
01:53:05,080 --> 01:53:08,250
His body is paralyzed with shock,
but his mind is alert.

1467
01:53:08,750 --> 01:53:13,080
He can see and hear us.
Please don't cry in front of him.

1468
01:53:14,920 --> 01:53:19,330
Speak to him normally,
motivate him, joke around.

1469
01:53:22,330 --> 01:53:25,000
Good news, Raju.
Your dad's recovered.

1470
01:53:25,210 --> 01:53:26,580
The new medicine worked.

1471
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,830
Is this your family tradition?

1472
01:53:30,620 --> 01:53:33,750
As one male gets up,
the other conks out?

1473
01:53:33,920 --> 01:53:35,670
Come, wake up.

1474
01:53:36,540 --> 01:53:37,960
Your dad wants Pia's scooter.

1475
01:53:38,080 --> 01:53:41,920
Should I give it to him?
Hope he won't dent it.

1476
01:53:47,920 --> 01:53:52,250
Raju, Farhan is live on webcam.
From the hostel.

1477
01:53:54,500 --> 01:53:57,330
Look, Virus has canceled
your suspension order.

1478
01:53:57,670 --> 01:53:59,920
Problem solved... Wake up now.

1479
01:54:00,210 --> 01:54:02,960
Everything's resolved!
You hear that?

1480
01:54:03,330 --> 01:54:06,170

- Brand new.

1492
01:55:07,710 --> 01:55:09,330
It cost 2000.

1493
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:11,250
Wake up now.

1494
01:55:12,420 --> 01:55:14,540
She bought not one,
but ten sarees.

1495
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:15,920
Look!

1496
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:19,120
Hey, Raju!

1497
01:55:19,170 --> 01:55:22,210

Did you hear about your sis?

1505
01:56:00,620 --> 01:56:03,330
She's getting married.

1506
01:56:04,330 --> 01:56:05,670
Without any dowry.

1507
01:56:06,330 --> 01:56:11,250
The bridegroom wants
nothing at all.

1508
01:56:11,460 --> 01:56:14,960
He just wants Kammo.

1509
01:56:15,580 --> 01:56:19,750
- You know who the bridegroom is?
- Yeah.

1510
01:56:19,790 --> 01:56:20,670
Guess!

1511
01:56:20,710 --> 01:56:22,620
- You know him very well.
- Yes.

1512
01:56:22,790 --> 01:56:24,460
- He loves animals.
- Huh...?

1513
01:56:25,250 --> 01:56:27,290
He's going to be a
wildlife photographer.

1514
01:56:27,370 --> 01:56:28,960
Quiet... Shhhh...

1515
01:56:29,040 --> 01:56:32,210
Didn't get it? It's our Farhan.

1516
01:56:33,170 --> 01:56:37,290
Farhan will never take any dowry.

1517
01:56:37,920 --> 01:56:42,290
Farhan will marry your sister.

1518
01:56:42,710 --> 01:56:46,870
For free! Free! Free!

1519
01:56:47,920 --> 01:56:50,040
Raju!

1520
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:00,790
<i><font color="#80FFFF">One kilo okra, 500 grams cheese

1521
01:57:01,170 --> 01:57:02,920
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Why sacrifice me...!</i></font>

1522
01:57:03,170 --> 01:57:05,170
Well done, buddy.

1523
01:57:05,960 --> 01:57:09,500
So it's all fixed,
Farhan will marry your sister.

1524
01:57:10,580 --> 01:57:11,580
Rancho!

1525
01:57:14,210 --> 01:57:17,370
Rascals... Stop fibbing.

1526
01:57:19,960 --> 01:57:21,000
Lucky escape!

1527
01:57:21,170 --> 01:57:27,580

1533
01:58:04,790 --> 01:58:06,370
You called for a taxi?

1534
01:58:06,420 --> 01:58:08,210
- I did.
- It's waiting.

1535
01:58:08,330 --> 01:58:09,830
Thank you. Why?

1536
01:58:10,250 --> 01:58:11,580
I'm going to the job interview.

1537
01:58:11,830 --> 01:58:13,080
You coming with me?

1538
01:58:13,460 --> 01:58:18,080
No. I'm going for the interview.
You're going home.

1539
01:58:18,210 --> 01:58:19,580
Why would I go home?

1540
01:58:21,080 --> 01:58:24,540
Remember, we promised this rascal.

1541
01:58:27,870 --> 01:58:29,960
Give me your tie.

1542
01:58:31,500 --> 01:58:32,370
Why?

1543
01:58:32,580 --> 01:58:36,500
I doubt you'll go for the
interview after reading this.

1544
01:58:37,420 --> 01:58:38,330
What's that?

1545
01:58:38,500 --> 01:58:41,370
- A letter...
- For you, from Hungary.

1546
01:58:41,710 --> 01:58:44,330
Some photographer
called Andre Istvan.

1547
01:58:52,250 --> 01:58:54,040
You posted my letter!

1548
01:58:54,210 --> 01:58:55,920
He loved your pictures.

1549
01:58:56,370 --> 01:58:59,040
The guy wants you to assist him...

1550
01:58:59,830 --> 01:59:03,370
in the Brazilian rain forest,
for a year.

1551
01:59:03,750 --> 01:59:05,330
Will pay you, too.

1552
01:59:21,250 --> 01:59:22,540
Dad will never agree.

1553
01:59:25,120 --> 01:59:27,790
Go speak to him...
from your heart.

1554
01:59:29,460 --> 01:59:30,620
For once, dump your fears...

1555
01:59:31,290 --> 01:59:37,330
or someday, on your deathbed,
you'll regret it.

1556
01:59:37,830 --> 01:59:40,420
You'll remember that the letter was
in your hand, taxi at the gate...

1557
01:59:40,540 --> 01:59:44,330
With just a little courage, you
could've turned your life around.

1558
01:59:50,870 --> 01:59:52,830
Do you think he'll like it?

1559
01:59:53,460 --> 01:59:55,790
Why such an expensive gift?

1560
01:59:56,920 --> 01:59:59,370
Our son's getting
his first job today.

1561
02:00:00,670 --> 02:00:04,580
Don't be stingy at
such a proud moment.

1562
02:00:06,500 --> 02:00:07,500
Farhan?

1563
02:00:12,580 --> 02:00:14,870
Don't you have
the job interview today?

1564
02:00:16,670 --> 02:00:17,540
I didn't go.

1565
02:00:20,290 --> 02:00:22,040
I don't want to be
an engineer, Dad.

1566
02:00:26,250 --> 02:00:28,210
What happened?
You had an accident?

1567
02:00:31,830 --> 02:00:37,080
See that building?
I jumped from its third floor.

1568
02:00:39,870 --> 02:00:40,790
Why?

1569
02:00:41,120 --> 02:00:43,460
Because I was rusticated
from college.

1570
02:00:46,370 --> 02:00:47,210
Why?

1571
02:00:47,710 --> 02:00:52,540
Drunk, I urinated
on the Director's door.

1572
02:00:54,830 --> 02:00:58,500
That scoundrel Rancho
is messing with your mind!

1573
02:00:58,620 --> 02:01:02,370
I don't enjoy Engineering.
I'd make a terrible engineer.

1574
02:01:04,500 --> 02:01:09,120
Rancho has a simple belief,
"Make your passion your profession."

1575
02:01:09,460 --> 02:01:11,040
"Then work will become play."

1576
02:01:11,170 --> 02:01:13,080
What'll you earn in that jungle?

1577
02:01:13,710 --> 02:01:17,370
A small stipend, but I'll learn a lot.

1578
02:01:17,420 --> 02:01:18,620
Five years from now...

1579
02:01:19,330 --> 02:01:24,080
when you see your friends buying
cars and homes, you'll curse yourself.

1580
02:01:24,170 --> 02:01:28,170
Life as an engineer will bring
only frustration. Then I'll curse you.

1581
02:01:30,210 --> 02:01:32,000
I'd rather curse myself, Dad.

1582
02:01:32,120 --> 02:01:33,330
The world will laugh!

1583
02:01:34,580 --> 02:01:36,580
Label you a loser,
for quitting in the final year.

1584
02:01:37,460 --> 02:01:43,170
Mr. Kapoor feels you're fortunate
to be at ICE. What'll he think?

1585
02:01:43,420 --> 02:01:45,580
Mr. Kapoor didn't provide me
with an air-conditioner.

1586
02:01:48,370 --> 02:01:50,670
It wasn't Mr. Kapoor who slept
in discomfort while I slept well.

1587
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:56,000
He didn't take me around the zoo
on his shoulders.

1588
02:01:58,830 --> 02:02:00,080
You did all that, Dad.

1589
02:02:02,540 --> 02:02:08,000
How you feel, matters to me.
Mr. Kapoor makes no difference.

1590
02:02:09,170 --> 02:02:11,040
I don't even know his first name.

1591
02:02:11,170 --> 02:02:14,080
You think you're the hero
of a melodrama?

1592
02:02:14,250 --> 02:02:17,000
Enough, please... he's upset.

1593
02:02:18,250 --> 02:02:20,710
God forbid, if he did
something crazy like Raju...

1594
02:02:20,920 --> 02:02:22,500
Then the discussion is over.

1595
02:02:22,790 --> 02:02:26,580
Don't say a word or
His Lordship will jump off the roof.

1596
02:02:30,040 --> 02:02:35,040
No, Dad. I'll never
attempt suicide. I promise.

1597
02:02:37,540 --> 02:02:44,540
The Rancho you detest
put this picture in my wallet.

1598
02:02:46,120 --> 02:02:49,960
Told me to see it if a suicidal
thought crossed my mind,

1599
02:02:50,080 --> 02:02:53,370
and imagine what'd
happen to your smiles

1600
02:02:53,420 --> 02:02:55,210
when you see my dead body.

1601
02:03:00,500 --> 02:03:04,540
I want to convince you, Dad...

1602
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,460
but not with a suicide threat.

1603
02:03:12,210 --> 02:03:16,040
Dad, what'll happen
if I become a photographer?

1604
02:03:16,330 --> 02:03:17,580
I'll earn less.

1605
02:03:18,500 --> 02:03:20,210
I'll have a smaller house,
a smaller car.

1606
02:03:22,250 --> 02:03:23,790
But I'll be happy.

1607
02:03:25,460 --> 02:03:26,750
I will be really happy.

1608
02:03:28,040 --> 02:03:29,710
Whatever I do for you
will be out of genuine love.

1609
02:03:31,620 --> 02:03:33,370
I've always listened to you.

1610
02:03:33,750 --> 02:03:36,870
For once,
let me listen to my heart.

1611
02:03:38,960 --> 02:03:39,870
Please... Dad.

1612
02:03:46,290 --> 02:03:47,250
Dad...

1613
02:03:48,460 --> 02:03:49,710
Please don't go away...

1614
02:03:55,920 --> 02:03:57,120
Return this.

1615
02:04:00,620 --> 02:04:03,080
Son, what's the cost
of a professional camera?

1616
02:04:04,330 --> 02:04:06,120
Can the laptop be exchanged for it?

1617
02:04:07,580 --> 02:04:09,460
If you need more money, just ask.

1618
02:04:18,250 --> 02:04:20,210
Go live your life, my son.

1619
02:04:23,120 --> 02:04:27,420
Your grades are consistently poor.
Reason?

1620
02:04:28,080 --> 02:04:28,960
Fear.

1621
02:04:30,040 --> 02:04:31,460
I was a good student
since childhood...

1622
02:04:32,210 --> 02:04:34,370
Parents hoped
I'd end their poverty.

1623
02:04:36,290 --> 02:04:37,290
That scared me.

1624
02:04:38,790 --> 02:04:42,290
Here I saw the mad race.
You don't count if you're not first.

1625
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:45,040
My fear grew.

1626
02:04:46,710 --> 02:04:48,170
Fear is not good for grades, sir.

1627
02:04:48,790 --> 02:04:51,210
I slipped on more charms and rings.

1628
02:04:52,210 --> 02:04:56,670
Prayed to God for favors.
No... begged for favors.

1629
02:04:59,750 --> 02:05:02,870
16 broken bones gave me
two months to think and reflect.

1630
02:05:03,420 --> 02:05:04,670
Finally, sense dawned.

1631
02:05:06,170 --> 02:05:11,330
Today I didn't beg God for this job,
just thanked him for this life.

1632
02:05:13,790 --> 02:05:17,790
If you reject me, no regrets.

1633
02:05:18,120 --> 02:05:22,250
I'll still do something
worthwhile with my life.

1634
02:05:22,790 --> 02:05:28,000
Such frank behavior
is not good for our firm.

1635
02:05:28,580 --> 02:05:32,870
We need someone diplomatic
to handle clients.

1636
02:05:32,960 --> 02:05:35,330
You're too straightforward.

1637
02:05:37,210 --> 02:05:38,040
But...

1638
02:05:39,210 --> 02:05:45,670
if you assure us
you'll control this attitude,

1639
02:05:45,790 --> 02:05:48,790
we may consider you.

1640
02:05:52,120 --> 02:05:55,290
It took two broken legs
to get me up on my feet.

1641
02:05:57,170 --> 02:05:59,000
Wasn't easy to get this attitude.

1642
02:05:59,710 --> 02:06:00,580
Can't change it, sir.

1643
02:06:04,250 --> 02:06:09,500
You keep your job...
I'll keep my attitude.

1644
02:06:09,620 --> 02:06:11,000
I'm sorry, no offense, sir.

1645
02:06:15,370 --> 02:06:16,250
Wait.

1646
02:06:18,210 --> 02:06:22,210
I've interviewed countless
candidates for 25 years.

1647
02:06:22,620 --> 02:06:25,500
Everyone turns into
a yes-man to get the job.

1648
02:06:25,670 --> 02:06:27,040
Where did you spring from, son?

1649
02:06:28,960 --> 02:06:29,790
Sir?

1650
02:06:30,040 --> 02:06:32,670
Shall we discuss the salary?

1651
02:06:40,210 --> 02:06:41,120
Thank you, sir.

1652
02:07:13,670 --> 02:07:17,870
Your Majesty, thou art great.

1653
02:07:19,790 --> 02:07:21,460
Accept this humble offering.

1654
02:07:58,040 --> 02:08:01,500
Govind!

1655
02:08:03,540 --> 02:08:07,040
You had said, "If he gets a job,
shave it off."

1656
02:08:14,250 --> 02:08:15,290
What have you done?

1657
02:08:18,870 --> 02:08:22,290
I feel naked without
my moustache.

1658
02:08:24,580 --> 02:08:26,500
I've lost my dignity.

1659
02:08:28,580 --> 02:08:31,040
I won't accept defeat, Rastogi.

1660
02:08:32,330 --> 02:08:36,370
The job isn't yours until you
pass your final exam.

1661
02:08:37,830 --> 02:08:41,790
And this time,
I will set the question paper.

1662
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:47,580
Dad, that's not fair.

1663
02:08:49,920 --> 02:08:53,460
Everything is fair in
Love and War.

1664
02:08:53,960 --> 02:08:57,290
And this is World War... III.

1665
02:08:58,750 --> 02:08:59,790
Rastogi, you're dead meat!

1666
02:09:04,750 --> 02:09:05,670
Hey.

1667
02:09:08,080 --> 02:09:09,000
What're you doing here?

1668
02:09:11,960 --> 02:09:12,830
Be careful.

1669
02:09:18,500 --> 02:09:22,370
- You've been drinking.
- Yup, had to down a couple.

1670
02:09:22,920 --> 02:09:25,120
A couple too many!

1671
02:09:25,210 --> 02:09:27,120
- Needed the guts.
- For what?

1672
02:09:28,870 --> 02:09:30,420
- For stealing this.
- What's this?

1673
02:09:31,500 --> 02:09:35,670
The duplicate key to Virus' office.

1674
02:09:38,170 --> 02:09:40,500
The question paper's
in a cover with a red seal.

1675
02:09:41,170 --> 02:09:45,170
Dad has set it, to fail Raju.

1676
02:09:45,460 --> 02:09:46,420
Go get it!

1677
02:09:47,460 --> 02:09:50,040
Are you mad or what?
That's cheating!

1678
02:09:54,500 --> 02:09:57,750
Everything's fair in
Love and War.

1679
02:09:59,250 --> 02:10:00,290
Tell me something...

1680
02:10:02,210 --> 02:10:03,420
Do you really feel...

1681
02:10:04,960 --> 02:10:10,500
the noses collide while kissing?

1682
02:10:15,920 --> 02:10:19,670
Wait. Have some dhokla.

1683
02:10:22,120 --> 02:10:24,750
You Gujaratis are so cute.

1684
02:10:25,670 --> 02:10:29,000
But why does your food
sound so dangerous?

1685
02:10:30,080 --> 02:10:35,330
Dhokla, Fafda, Handwa,
Thepla, Khakhra...

1686
02:10:36,460 --> 02:10:38,580
Sound like missiles.

1687
02:10:38,620 --> 02:10:39,500
C'mon.

1688
02:10:39,710 --> 02:10:42,210
"Today Bush dropped
two Dhoklas on Iraq."

1689
02:10:42,830 --> 02:10:45,710
"400 dead, 200 injured."

1690
02:10:46,040 --> 02:10:46,960
C'mon.

1691
02:10:50,420 --> 02:10:51,420
Oh...

1692
02:10:52,920 --> 02:10:57,370
I can deal with Khakhra, Fafda.
But your name...

1693
02:10:58,290 --> 02:11:01,620
"Ranchhoddas Shyamaldas Chanchad."
Yuck.

1694
02:11:02,830 --> 02:11:05,420
I won't change my last name
after marriage.

1695
02:11:07,250 --> 02:11:10,250
Pia, we can't get married.

1696
02:11:13,790 --> 02:11:14,710
Why?

1697
02:11:15,540 --> 02:11:17,000
Is there someone else?

1698
02:11:19,500 --> 02:11:20,370
No.

1699
02:11:20,670 --> 02:11:22,420
- Are you gay?
- No.

1700
02:11:24,250 --> 02:11:26,170
Then why don't you propose to me?

1701
02:11:30,710 --> 02:11:32,170
- Are you impotent?
- No.

1702
02:11:34,830 --> 02:11:36,670
Then prove it.

1703
02:11:37,120 --> 02:11:38,080
Pia, no.

1704
02:11:38,330 --> 02:11:39,790
Stop, stop!

1705
02:11:39,960 --> 02:11:42,330
- What happened?
- We didn't inform Pia.

1706
02:11:42,790 --> 02:11:44,870
Stop here,
my bladders are bursting.

1707
02:11:44,920 --> 02:11:46,790
- Shut up!
- Are you in touch with her?

1708
02:11:47,080 --> 02:11:50,250
- No... I have her home number.
- Then call her, I'll stop.

1709
02:11:56,710 --> 02:11:57,540
Hello?

1710
02:11:57,620 --> 02:11:59,870
No place for urine-expulsion
in this country.

1711
02:11:59,920 --> 02:12:03,330
- Hello, is Pia there?
- No, she's not.

1712
02:12:03,710 --> 02:12:05,500
Is she at the hospital?

1713
02:12:05,620 --> 02:12:07,210
Why would she be there?

1714
02:12:07,420 --> 02:12:09,620
She's getting married today,
in Manali.

1715
02:12:17,620 --> 02:12:18,870
Too late! She's married.

1716
02:12:20,290 --> 02:12:23,210
Not yet. It's a six hour drive.

1717
02:12:23,540 --> 02:12:25,620
If we rush, we'll reach
before the vows.

1718
02:12:26,120 --> 02:12:27,000
What do you say?

1719
02:12:28,960 --> 02:12:31,370
It's a no-brainer.
Let's turn back.

1720
02:12:31,580 --> 02:12:33,330
No turning back.

1721
02:12:33,790 --> 02:12:36,540
Straight to Ladakh.
We'll meet Rancho and return.

1722
02:12:36,710 --> 02:12:39,290
I have a Friday meeting with
Phunsukh Wangdu.

1723
02:12:39,420 --> 02:12:40,960
Get into the car.

1724
02:12:41,210 --> 02:12:44,370
If I miss my meeting,
the Japanese will get him.

1725
02:12:44,750 --> 02:12:47,170
They're offering him a
first name in the company.

1726
02:12:47,290 --> 02:12:50,290
"Phunsukh and Fujiyashi",
profit sharing...

1727
02:13:23,500 --> 02:13:25,670
- "Pia weds Suhas"!
- Thanks for the suit.

1728
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:29,500
Virus will have a heart attack.

1729
02:13:30,580 --> 02:13:33,290
At every daughter's wedding,
we're there to rock the party.

1730
02:13:34,710 --> 02:13:38,120
Listen, I'll update Pia,
you peel off the price tag.

1731
02:13:54,920 --> 02:13:57,170
- Farhan.
- We found Rancho.

1732
02:14:05,290 --> 02:14:06,920
- For Room 107?
- Yes, sir.

1733
02:14:07,620 --> 02:14:10,460
- You've taken ages.
- Sorry, sir.

1734
02:14:10,580 --> 02:14:11,460
Off, now.

1735
02:14:20,500 --> 02:14:22,210
- Housekeeping, sir.
- Come in.

1736
02:14:22,750 --> 02:14:25,370
Amore... Amore...

1737
02:14:25,460 --> 02:14:26,830
Quick, iron my coat.

1738
02:14:26,920 --> 02:14:29,790
Amore... Amore...

1739
02:14:30,620 --> 02:14:33,870
We found Rancho!
Now you can't marry this ass.

1740
02:14:34,370 --> 02:14:35,460
You're mad, Farhan.

1741
02:14:36,580 --> 02:14:39,250
Don't fool yourself, Pia.
You still love Rancho.

1742
02:14:39,460 --> 02:14:41,420
You're still eating his favorite food.

1743
02:14:41,710 --> 02:14:44,370
Amore... Amore...

1744
02:14:59,750 --> 02:15:03,960
He's incorrigible.
Once a price tag, always a price tag.

1745
02:15:04,040 --> 02:15:06,920
Shut up, Farhan.
Suhas is a changed man.

1746
02:15:07,460 --> 02:15:09,460
He doesn't speak of
brands and prices anymore.

1747
02:15:09,500 --> 02:15:12,710
My 150,000 coat.

1748
02:15:12,790 --> 02:15:14,920
Why do you people eat sauce?

1749
02:15:14,960 --> 02:15:17,460
- I'll sort it out, sir.
- How?

1750
02:15:17,540 --> 02:15:20,120
Our laundry specializes in
cleaning mint-stained suits.

1751
02:15:20,250 --> 02:15:22,250
I'll clean it in a jiffy.

1752
02:15:27,540 --> 02:15:28,870
Get it soon.

1753
02:15:29,830 --> 02:15:32,080
- But it's too late now, Farhan.
- Pia.

1754
02:15:32,960 --> 02:15:35,210
Let's go, Pia, we're late.

1755
02:15:46,620 --> 02:15:50,000
Pia, it's me... Raju.
Don't yell, they'll kill me.

1756
02:15:55,120 --> 02:15:56,040
Where is Suhas?

1757
02:15:56,080 --> 02:15:58,830
Housekeeping took my coat.

1758
02:15:59,290 --> 02:16:01,080
Go... Send Suhas here.

1759
02:16:01,290 --> 02:16:04,500
It's rude to leave the ceremony.

1760
02:16:15,790 --> 02:16:17,460
- Yeah, Farhan?
- The car's ready.

1761
02:16:17,790 --> 02:16:20,420
Grab her hand and run.
Don't move.

1762
02:16:21,920 --> 02:16:23,540
- Sir...
- My coat?

1763
02:16:23,580 --> 02:16:24,750
You're here...

1764
02:16:24,920 --> 02:16:26,540
- So who's at the altar?
- Altar?

1765
02:16:28,830 --> 02:16:31,330
Another couple of rounds,
and we'll be considered married.

1766
02:16:31,500 --> 02:16:33,790
I'm already married, Pia.
Let's go.

1767
02:16:34,250 --> 02:16:37,540
It's too late.
People will laugh at me.

1768
02:16:37,790 --> 02:16:39,580
So you'll commit suicide?

1769
02:16:40,170 --> 02:16:41,080
Rastogi!

1770
02:16:41,170 --> 02:16:43,290
People will gossip briefly,
then forget.

1771
02:16:44,670 --> 02:16:47,670
But you... you'll regret
on your deathbed.

1772
02:16:47,750 --> 02:16:50,540
That the car was at the gate,
Rancho within reach...

1773
02:16:50,870 --> 02:16:54,370
but in fear of people,
you married this ass.

1774
02:16:56,540 --> 02:16:57,500
Housekeeping?

1775
02:17:37,210 --> 02:17:40,250
Pia, minor problem.

1776
02:17:40,540 --> 02:17:41,460
What?

1777
02:17:41,830 --> 02:17:43,460
We don't know if Rancho's married.

1778
02:17:43,540 --> 02:17:44,370
What!

1779
02:17:44,460 --> 02:17:47,120
- He won't be married.
- And if he is?

1780
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:49,420
Then we'll drop you back.

1781
02:17:50,290 --> 02:17:54,080
Relax! Handmade biscuit?

1782
02:17:57,920 --> 02:17:58,790
What's he doing here?

1783
02:17:59,830 --> 02:18:03,250
- Ignore him.
- The biscuit's very good.

1784
02:18:04,290 --> 02:18:06,170
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Till yesterday,

1785

Where's it hidden...

1795
02:18:47,080 --> 02:18:50,710
We'll grow old searching!
Rancho, ask Pia.

1796
02:18:56,920 --> 02:18:58,080
Pia, your phone.

1797
02:18:59,330 --> 02:19:02,580
Mr. Papa-To-Be!
If you say "All is well", he kicks.

1798
02:19:02,670 --> 02:19:03,500
He kicked.

1799
02:19:05,960 --> 02:19:07,460
Pia, your phone.

1800
02:19:13,290 --> 02:19:14,540
Found it! Rancho.

1801
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:17,000
Hello?

1802
02:19:35,420 --> 02:19:37,670
Quick, photocopy this.

1803
02:19:58,750 --> 02:19:59,620
Where was it?

1804
02:19:59,920 --> 02:20:00,920
Put it back.

1805
02:20:24,250 --> 02:20:26,290
- We're safe!
- Where were you?

1806
02:20:30,870 --> 02:20:32,580
- Here.
- What's this?

1807
02:20:32,920 --> 02:20:33,830
A gift.

1808
02:20:34,960 --> 02:20:38,870
Question paper.
Virus set it himself, to fail you.

1809
02:20:46,460 --> 02:20:47,790
Strange buddies!

1810
02:20:49,120 --> 02:20:53,710
First teach you to be upright,
then offer a path to shame.

1811
02:20:55,750 --> 02:20:56,790
No way!

1812
02:20:58,370 --> 02:20:59,750
If I pass,
it'll be on my own steam.

1813
02:21:03,620 --> 02:21:04,790
If I don't, it's still okay.

1814
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:26,540
<i><font color="#80FFFF">He'd won us over!
I felt like embracing him as family...</i></font>

1815
02:21:27,460 --> 02:21:29,370
<i><font color="#80FFFF">but then I controlled my emotions.</i></font>

1816
02:21:48,460 --> 02:21:51,460
- Damn thief.
- Sir, please, sir.

1817
02:21:51,580 --> 02:21:54,790
- Rascal.
- Sorry, sir.

1818
02:21:55,330 --> 02:21:56,620
Wanted to change the system?

1819
02:21:58,330 --> 02:22:03,290
- You'll pee on my door.
- Sir, what're you doing?

1820
02:22:04,790 --> 02:22:05,790
Sorry, sir.

1821
02:22:07,250 --> 02:22:09,120
You are rusticated!

1822
02:22:09,920 --> 02:22:12,920
If all of you aren't out by morning,
I'll call the police.

1823
02:22:13,330 --> 02:22:14,670
I will call the police!

1824
02:22:17,170 --> 02:22:18,000
Rascals!

1825
02:22:18,330 --> 02:22:19,670
Rascals, all of you.

1826
02:22:23,670 --> 02:22:26,000
How did he get my office key?

1827
02:22:27,290 --> 02:22:28,710
I gave him the key, Dad.

1828
02:22:30,080 --> 02:22:33,710
I wish I'd given this key to my brother...
He'd be alive today.

1829
02:22:33,870 --> 02:22:34,790
Stop it, Pia.

1830
02:22:35,920 --> 02:22:38,750
You think your son
fell off a train and died?

1831
02:22:39,290 --> 02:22:40,210
Shut up, Pia.

1832
02:22:40,290 --> 02:22:42,580
You decided he'd be an engineer.

1833
02:22:42,750 --> 02:22:45,040
Did you ever ask him
what he wanted to be?

1834
02:22:45,830 --> 02:22:47,420
You put such pressure on him...

1835
02:22:47,790 --> 02:22:50,080
that he chose death
over the entrance exam.

1836
02:22:54,330 --> 02:22:55,210
I don't understand...

1837
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,580
Dad, you go to your room.

1838
02:23:02,460 --> 02:23:04,830
Pia, don't do this.

1839
02:23:07,290 --> 02:23:11,210
He wanted to study Literature,
be a writer.

1840
02:23:13,460 --> 02:23:15,960
But all he wrote was
this suicide note.

1841
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:17,290
Put that away, please.

1842
02:23:17,460 --> 02:23:19,120
No more cover-ups!

1843
02:23:22,500 --> 02:23:25,750
Just once...

1844
02:23:25,790 --> 02:23:29,500
if you'd said, "Don't do Engineering
if you don't want to..."

1845
02:23:30,330 --> 02:23:31,750
"just do what your heart is in...",

1846
02:23:33,210 --> 02:23:34,960
then he'd be alive today.

1847
02:23:42,870 --> 02:23:44,960
He didn't commit suicide.

1848
02:23:45,670 --> 02:23:46,670
You're right, Dad.

1849
02:23:48,210 --> 02:23:49,460
It wasn't suicide...

1850
02:23:51,920 --> 02:23:53,000
It was murder.

1851

Mona?

1855
02:24:37,790 --> 02:24:40,290
Go back, Millimeter.
Why're you following us?

1856
02:24:40,830 --> 02:24:43,120
Why? Your pop owns the road?

1857
02:24:43,250 --> 02:24:44,960
Please help,
we are desperate here!

1858
02:24:45,920 --> 02:24:47,790
You can't send an ambulance?

1859
02:24:48,790 --> 02:24:50,710
Get it from another hospital.

1860
02:24:51,330 --> 02:24:54,870
The entire city's flooded, sir.
We're helpless.

1861
02:24:58,370 --> 02:24:59,670
Mona, you okay?

1862
02:25:00,210 --> 02:25:01,210
Rancho, Pia.

1863
02:25:03,580 --> 02:25:07,460
Rancho, you can't reach here.
Do as I say.

1864
02:25:07,750 --> 02:25:12,620
The water bag has burst.

1865

Disconnected! Mona.

1866
02:25:21,370 --> 02:25:22,370
Mona!

1867
02:25:26,750 --> 02:25:28,290
- Turn on the lights.
- Where to?

1868
02:25:28,790 --> 02:25:32,750
- To the table tennis table.
- Pia, we're in the common room.

1869
02:25:36,710 --> 02:25:38,580
Raju, turn on the web camera.

Where's Mona? Show me.

1871
02:25:47,420 --> 02:25:48,370
Hold on.

1872
02:25:50,580 --> 02:25:51,460

All is well.

Stop it! I can't do it.

1887
02:26:36,500 --> 02:26:38,330
Rancho, check if there's crowning.

1888

Crowning...?

C'mon, Rancho.
Check quickly.

1892
02:26:52,500 --> 02:26:53,420
Go!

1893
02:26:54,080 --> 02:26:56,580
Go, Rancho, go. C'mon.

1894
02:27:03,830 --> 02:27:05,960
No crowning.

1895
02:27:06,040 --> 02:27:07,920
Mona, please push.

1896
02:27:10,580 --> 02:27:11,460
Mona!

1897
02:27:14,460 --> 02:27:15,620
She's tired, Pia.

1898
02:27:16,040 --> 02:27:19,750
Wake her! If she won't push,
it's a big problem.

- They need a vacuum cup.
- Where will they get one?

1900
02:27:24,040 --> 02:27:26,920
What's a vacuum cup?
How is it used?

1901
02:27:27,170 --> 02:27:28,040

1906
02:27:45,210 --> 02:27:47,040
- With a vacuum cleaner.
- Vacuum cleaner?

1907
02:27:47,080 --> 02:27:48,170
Yes, sir, vacuum cleaner.

1908
02:27:48,210 --> 02:27:50,580

Yes, in my office.

02:27:54,330 --> 02:27:57,080
- Farhan, rush and get it.
- Here's the key.

1912
02:28:03,040 --> 02:28:06,500
Mona, push.
C'mon, push.

1913

Oh, my God!

1914

- The power's gone.

How'll the vacuum work now?

1917
02:28:20,210 --> 02:28:22,790
Farhan, you get the vacuum,
I'll get the power.

How?

What nonsense is this?

Not this Virus.
My Virus, the inverter.

- Get that, quick.
- Okay.

1923

Raju, wake up the hostel.

1924
02:28:38,500 --> 02:28:41,460
Get car batteries, wires,
and a vacuum gauge.

1925

Emergency in the common room!

- Where's Rancho?
- Here, sir.

Keep the batteries here

Good. Fix this to the gauge.

- Yes.

Hit the table

0.5!

Two clips,

Farhan, two clips on the cord.

Cut at the center,
get a towel.

1980
02:34:02,210 --> 02:34:09,120
All is well.

1981
02:34:50,540 --> 02:34:53,920
<i><font color="#80FFFF">If Virus had said, "My grandson

1982

1984
02:34:59,710 --> 02:35:02,870
What a kick!
Wanna be a footballer?

1985
02:35:03,920 --> 02:35:06,960
Be what you want to be.

1986
02:35:23,420 --> 02:35:27,330
Wait! I've not finished with you!

1987
02:35:29,710 --> 02:35:32,290
First day of college,
you'd asked me a question...

1988
02:35:32,620 --> 02:35:35,040
Why didn't astronauts
use a pencil in space?

1989
02:35:35,790 --> 02:35:38,080
If a pencil tip breaks...

1990
02:35:38,250 --> 02:35:44,170
it'd float in zero gravity.
Get into eyes, nose, instruments...

1991
02:35:44,290 --> 02:35:46,250
You were wrong!

1992
02:35:47,830 --> 02:35:49,710
You cannot be right all the time.

1993
02:35:51,790 --> 02:35:52,830
You understand?

1994
02:35:55,250 --> 02:35:56,120
Yes, sir.

1995
02:35:57,370 --> 02:35:59,500
This was an important invention.

1996
02:36:00,790 --> 02:36:01,830
You understand?

1997
02:36:03,210 --> 02:36:04,080
Yes, sir.

1998
02:36:06,620 --> 02:36:15,040
My Director said, "When you find
an extraordinary student..."

1999
02:36:33,870 --> 02:36:38,330
Go, study!
Pass your exams and leave.

<i><font color="#80FFFF">And now, Student of the Year...</i></font>

2002
02:37:09,670 --> 02:37:11,000
Sir, one photo.

2003
02:37:28,460 --> 02:37:31,920
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I wanted to capture all these
memories and take them home.</i></font>

2005
02:37:39,620 --> 02:37:41,290

Rancho for the last time.</i></font>

2007
02:38:19,330 --> 02:38:20,290
Untie him.

2008
02:38:23,620 --> 02:38:25,540
I'll sue you all in an
American court.

2009
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:40,870
Raju.

2010
02:38:59,870 --> 02:39:01,870
Only Rancho can create
a school like this.

2011
02:39:02,420 --> 02:39:03,500
But where is he?

2012
02:39:07,960 --> 02:39:09,210
Don't pee here.

2013
02:39:10,290 --> 02:39:11,920
Go away creatures.

2014
02:39:12,290 --> 02:39:15,370
- Don't pee here.
- I'll smack you.

2015
02:39:33,120 --> 02:39:35,330
Bingo! He cannot be far.

2016
02:39:46,790 --> 02:39:49,080
Excuse me,
where is Ranchhoddas?

2017
02:39:49,210 --> 02:39:51,210
- He's not Ranchhoddas!
- Rancho...

2018
02:39:51,290 --> 02:39:53,500
Chhote... Dammit,
what's his name?

2019
02:39:53,620 --> 02:39:56,330
Calm down. Come with me.

2020
02:39:58,790 --> 02:39:59,710
- Where's he?
- Rancho.

2021
02:40:07,080 --> 02:40:10,250
Farhan, he's read all your books.

2022
02:40:16,540 --> 02:40:22,580
Raju, he reads your blog everyday.
Proudly shares it with the kids.

2023
02:40:26,080 --> 02:40:29,580
Remember your helmet, Pia?
It was stolen...

2024
02:40:31,500 --> 02:40:34,710
Who are you?
How do you know us?

2025
02:40:34,960 --> 02:40:37,040
- Didn't you recognize me?
- No.

2026
02:40:37,960 --> 02:40:41,960
How would you?
Millimeter is now Centimeter.

2027
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:51,500
Not Centimeter, you're Kilometer.

2028
02:40:52,330 --> 02:40:53,330
How did you get here?

2029
02:40:53,420 --> 02:40:56,670
I got a letter with
a train ticket inside.

2030
02:40:56,920 --> 02:41:00,670
It said, "Miss being in school?
Catch this train"... I did.

2031
02:41:02,250 --> 02:41:03,370
That rascal Rancho!

2032
02:41:07,540 --> 02:41:08,540
Where is that idiot?

2033
02:41:19,710 --> 02:41:21,620
Dorje, you fly it.

2034
02:41:36,580 --> 02:41:42,080
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Every night you ride into my dreams

2035
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:45,290
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Instead of a veil,
you lift your helmet...</i></font>

2036
02:41:45,920 --> 02:41:48,670
<i><font color="#80FFFF">and come close to kiss me.</i></font>

2037
02:41:52,250 --> 02:41:53,500
Couldn't you tell me before leaving?

2038
02:41:55,830 --> 02:41:56,670
No.

2039
02:41:58,460 --> 02:41:59,370
Sorry.

2040
02:41:59,750 --> 02:42:00,580
Did you marry?

2041
02:42:01,170 --> 02:42:05,420
What? No.

2042
02:42:06,370 --> 02:42:09,000
- You?
- Almost... Idiot.

2043
02:42:16,580 --> 02:42:17,460
So?

2044
02:42:18,920 --> 02:42:19,920
So what?

2045
02:42:20,420 --> 02:42:21,750
Do you love someone?

2046
02:42:26,170 --> 02:42:27,000
Yes.

2047
02:42:33,040 --> 02:42:33,920
Who?

2048
02:42:35,210 --> 02:42:36,080
You.

2049
02:43:01,790 --> 02:43:05,000
See, the noses don't collide, stupid.

2050
02:43:06,210 --> 02:43:07,040
That's right!

2051
02:43:07,290 --> 02:43:08,420
Rancho.

2052
02:43:09,920 --> 02:43:10,790
Hi... Farhan!

2053
02:43:10,960 --> 02:43:13,080
Screw your "Hi".

2054
02:43:13,500 --> 02:43:18,250
- Hey, listen to me...
- No, you listen to me.

2055
02:43:18,420 --> 02:43:20,710
I can explain everything.

2056
02:43:21,790 --> 02:43:22,670
Hi... Raju!

2057
02:43:22,710 --> 02:43:24,620
How we hunted for you!

2058
02:43:27,500 --> 02:43:31,620
Didn't have a coin
for one phone call?

2059
02:43:33,670 --> 02:43:35,960
Add a couple from me too.

2060
02:43:36,500 --> 02:43:41,710
- Rascal, scoundrel!
- Let him go now.

2061
02:43:41,830 --> 02:43:42,790
Okay, okay, enough.

2062
02:43:44,120 --> 02:43:45,920
On your feet, c'mon.

2063
02:44:15,920 --> 02:44:17,670
Having fun, idiots?

2064
02:44:17,920 --> 02:44:19,790
Hey... Hi, Chatur.

2065
02:44:20,080 --> 02:44:25,170
Ranchhoddas Chanchad.
How do you do, Mr. Teacher?

2066
02:44:25,580 --> 02:44:32,370
Wow, you're a teacher in a village.
A for Apple, B for Ball...

2067
02:44:34,290 --> 02:44:39,040
Our trains left together.
But yours traveled in reverse...

2068
02:44:39,580 --> 02:44:42,500
from engineer to primary teacher.

2069
02:44:44,670 --> 02:44:47,580
What's your salary, Chanchad? 5000?

2070
02:44:47,960 --> 02:44:49,750
For me that's like $100.

2071
02:44:50,170 --> 02:44:53,580
My son's pocket money is
more than your salary.

2072
02:44:53,750 --> 02:44:56,540
- Cut the crap.
- Crap is what he gave us.

2073
02:44:56,710 --> 02:45:01,790
Wanted to change the education
system, change the world.

2074
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:04,580
Finally what does he change?
Kids' diapers.

2075
02:45:05,040 --> 02:45:06,460
You gonna break his jaw
or should I?

2076
02:45:06,620 --> 02:45:07,540
Just relax.

2077
02:45:07,620 --> 02:45:14,420
Remember I'd said
one day you'd cry and I'd laugh?

2078
02:45:16,080 --> 02:45:22,870
Sign here.
Accept, "You lost, I won!"

2079
02:45:23,120 --> 02:45:26,170
"Declaration of Defeat"!
Unbelievable, man.

2080
02:45:26,330 --> 02:45:28,420
- Chatur...
- Crazy guy.

2081
02:45:30,210 --> 02:45:34,540
Hey, this is Virus' pen!
You pinched it?

2082
02:45:34,960 --> 02:45:36,370
Forget it, man.

2083
02:45:37,040 --> 02:45:40,750
This is for winners, not losers.

2084
02:45:41,830 --> 02:45:48,830
If your school ever needs help,
call my assistant for a donation.

2085
02:45:50,960 --> 02:45:53,790
A for Apple, B for Ball...

2086
02:45:55,290 --> 02:45:58,080
- He hasn't changed at all!
- Ignore him.

2087
02:45:58,210 --> 02:45:59,710
He's full of crap.

2088
02:46:00,040 --> 02:46:04,460
Good news is your name
isn't Ranchhoddas Chanchad.

2089
02:46:04,830 --> 02:46:08,870
Imagine, after marriage,
I'm Pia Chanchad. Yuck!

2090
02:46:09,620 --> 02:46:11,120
By the way,
what is your real name?

2091
02:46:11,960 --> 02:46:12,870
Phunsukh Wangdu.

2092
02:46:13,670 --> 02:46:14,580
Wangdu?

2093
02:46:14,750 --> 02:46:15,620
Pia Wangdu!

2094
02:46:16,290 --> 02:46:18,040
You mean you're a scientist?

2095
02:46:18,250 --> 02:46:19,580
You have 400 patents?

2096
02:46:19,710 --> 02:46:21,580
I won't change my name
after marriage.

2097
02:46:21,620 --> 02:46:23,250
You mean you're Chatur's Wangdu?

2098
02:46:23,330 --> 02:46:25,540
It's you the Japanese are wooing?

2099
02:46:25,580 --> 02:46:26,500
- I don't like Wangdu.
- I think so.

2100
02:46:27,080 --> 02:46:29,290
Are you a scientist or a teacher?

2101
02:46:29,710 --> 02:46:31,670
Scientist, but I also teach children.

2102
02:46:31,710 --> 02:46:33,830
So you are THE Phunsukh Wangdu?

2103
02:46:33,870 --> 02:46:35,040
Yes, yes!

2104
02:46:36,290 --> 02:46:39,210
- Hey, Silencer.
- Hey, Chatur, come back.

2105
02:46:40,460 --> 02:46:41,580
Take that.

2106
02:46:43,120 --> 02:46:45,420
Wait, I'll stop him.

2107
02:46:53,290 --> 02:46:56,920
Mr. Wangdu,
I can't believe it's you.

2108
02:46:57,420 --> 02:46:58,670
I'm sorry, Mr. Chatur.

2109
02:46:58,750 --> 02:47:01,080
I can't sign the deal
with your company.

2110
02:47:01,580 --> 02:47:03,620
What, sir? Why, sir?

2111
02:47:03,830 --> 02:47:06,670
How do I sign, man?
You took my pen.

2112
02:47:08,540 --> 02:47:10,540
What pen, sir?
I didn't get you...

2113
02:47:10,870 --> 02:47:13,570
The one in your hand, Virus' pen.

2114
02:47:13,570 --> 02:47:15,080
Virus' pen...?

2115
02:47:18,580 --> 02:47:20,080
Mr. Wangdu...?

2116
02:47:20,250 --> 02:47:21,460
Yes, Chatur?

2117
02:47:22,250 --> 02:47:24,250
A for Apple, B for Ball is...

2118
02:47:27,370 --> 02:47:29,040
S for Screwed.

2119
02:47:36,170 --> 02:47:40,290
You got me, Rancho.
I mean, Mr. Wangdu.

2120
02:47:40,670 --> 02:47:42,290
Totally floored me. Good one.

2121
02:47:42,960 --> 02:47:47,250
I hope our personal problems
won't affect this deal.

2122
02:47:47,420 --> 02:47:50,620
Hey, Chatur, take that.

2123
02:47:51,250 --> 02:47:53,250
I was just joking, man.

2124
02:47:53,620 --> 02:47:57,500
Deep down,
I knew you'd do great things.

2125
02:47:58,500 --> 02:48:00,290
You're fibbing.

2126
02:48:00,370 --> 02:48:02,330
No, really, I swear.

2127
02:48:02,420 --> 02:48:04,420
Rancho - 100, Chatur - 0

2128
02:48:04,790 --> 02:48:07,120
You win, I lose.
You don't believe me?

2129
02:48:08,540 --> 02:48:09,920
Beware of farts.

2130
02:48:09,960 --> 02:48:14,250
Your Majesty, thou art great.
Accept this humble offering.

2131
02:48:14,330 --> 02:48:16,710
Free advice, Mr. Wangdu.
Run for your life!

2132
02:48:20,420 --> 02:48:24,500
Rancho, I'll lose my job, man.
I have small kids...

2133
