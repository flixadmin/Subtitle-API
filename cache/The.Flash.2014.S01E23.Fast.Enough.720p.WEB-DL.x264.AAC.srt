<i>My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

3
00:00:10,378 --> 00:00:13,278
<i>When I was a child,
I saw my mother killed</i>

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,500
<i>by something impossible.</i>

5
00:00:15,717 --> 00:00:18,751
<i>My father went to prison
for her murder.</i>

6
00:00:18,753 --> 00:00:21,921
<i>Then an accident made me
the impossible.</i>

7
00:00:21,923 --> 00:00:26,158
<i>To the outside world, I am
an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,562
<i>but secretly,
I use my speed to fight crime</i>

9
00:00:29,564 --> 00:00:31,097
<i>and find others like me.</i>

10
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:33,599
<i>And one day,
I'll find who killed my mother</i>

11
00:00:33,601 --> 00:00:36,168
<i>and get justice for my father.</i>

12
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,204
<i>That day is today.</i>

13
00:00:42,743 --> 00:00:46,145
What?
No Big Belly Burger?

14
00:00:46,147 --> 00:00:48,047
It's one of the few perks
of living in this time.

15
00:00:48,049 --> 00:00:49,582
We're out of cows
where I come from.

16
00:00:49,584 --> 00:00:52,785
You don't care about that.
You have questions. Go ahead.

17
00:00:52,787 --> 00:00:55,721
Not sure where to start...
Thawne.

18
00:00:55,723 --> 00:00:58,958
That is your real name...
Eobard Thawne.

19
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,660
- Since the day I was born.
- And when was that?

20
00:01:00,662 --> 00:01:02,194
136 years from now.

21
00:01:02,196 --> 00:01:06,298
That's not what
you want to know.

22
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,435
Go ahead, Barry.

23
00:01:09,437 --> 00:01:10,703
Ask it.

24
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:14,540
Why did you kill my mother?

25
00:01:14,542 --> 00:01:16,642
Because I hate you.

26
00:01:16,644 --> 00:01:18,811
Not you now.
You years from now.

27
00:01:18,813 --> 00:01:21,881
- In the future.
- In a future. Yes.

28
00:01:21,883 --> 00:01:23,783
We're enemies, rivals,
opposites,

29
00:01:23,785 --> 00:01:25,051
reverses of one another.

30
00:01:25,053 --> 00:01:26,786
Why?
Wh-why were we enemies?

31
00:01:26,788 --> 00:01:29,388
It doesn't matter.

32
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:32,124
It doesn't...
matter anymore.

33
00:01:32,126 --> 00:01:34,193
What matters is that
neither of us was strong enough

34
00:01:34,195 --> 00:01:36,962
to defeat the other.

35
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:39,699
Until I learned your secret.

36
00:01:39,701 --> 00:01:42,435
I learned your name.

37
00:01:42,437 --> 00:01:45,104
Barry Allen.

38
00:01:45,106 --> 00:01:48,974
And finally, I knew how
to defeat you once and for all.

39
00:01:48,976 --> 00:01:52,878
Travel back in time,
kill you as a child.

40
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,748
Wipe you
from the face of the earth.

41
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:59,685
But then you, future you,
that is, followed me back,

42
00:01:59,687 --> 00:02:01,620
and we fought.

43
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:05,458
We both landed
some pretty solid shots.

44
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:10,429
And then you, future you, got
your younger self out of there.

45
00:02:10,431 --> 00:02:13,199
I was so mad.

46
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:17,970
But then I thought...

47
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:21,807
what if you were
to suffer a tragedy?

48
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:25,511
What if you were to suffer
something so horrible,

49
00:02:25,513 --> 00:02:28,114
so traumatic that your child
self could never recover?

50
00:02:28,116 --> 00:02:30,649
Then you would not become
The Flash.

51
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:33,853
And so I stabbed your mother
in the heart,

52
00:02:33,855 --> 00:02:35,454
and I was free.

53
00:02:35,456 --> 00:02:39,325
Finally able to return
to a future without The Flash,

54
00:02:39,327 --> 00:02:43,596
only to realize
that in traveling back

55
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:46,298
I'd lost my way home.

56
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,668
Lost my ability to harness
the speed force.

57
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:53,105
And without it,
I was stuck here.

58
00:02:53,107 --> 00:02:56,142
Stranded in this time,
unable to return to my own.

59
00:02:56,144 --> 00:03:00,780
And the only way back
was The Flash.

60
00:03:00,782 --> 00:03:04,316
But The Flash was gone,
and so I created him.

61
00:03:10,157 --> 00:03:11,624
Why train me?

62
00:03:11,626 --> 00:03:14,193
Why help me save
so many people?

63
00:03:14,195 --> 00:03:17,930
Because I needed you
to get fast.

64
00:03:17,932 --> 00:03:22,601
Fast enough to rupture
the space-time barrier

65
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:24,570
and create a stable wormhole

66
00:03:24,572 --> 00:03:27,573
through which
I could return home.

67
00:03:27,575 --> 00:03:29,175
Why would I ever do that?

68
00:03:29,177 --> 00:03:30,643
Because...

69
00:03:30,645 --> 00:03:35,881
Barry Allen,
if you give me what I want,

70
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:38,117
I'm gonna give you
what you want.

71
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:43,322
You can go back
and save your mother.

72
00:03:43,324 --> 00:03:46,524
You can prevent your father
from going to prison.

73
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:50,227
You can reunite
the Allen family.

74
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,034
No.

75
00:03:55,036 --> 00:03:57,436
No, I don't believe you.

76
00:03:59,873 --> 00:04:01,941
I want to kill you right now.

77
00:04:01,943 --> 00:04:03,642
I know that rage.

78
00:04:03,644 --> 00:04:06,378
I used to feel that rage
every time I looked upon you.

79
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:10,249
And now, somehow,

80
00:04:10,251 --> 00:04:15,287
I know
what Joe and Henry feel

81
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:18,490
when they look on you
with pride.

82
00:04:18,492 --> 00:04:19,725
With love.

83
00:04:19,727 --> 00:04:20,893
No. No.

84
00:04:20,895 --> 00:04:23,762
Don't you
ever say that to me!

85
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,631
I know you're upset,

86
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:28,734
but I'm giving you a chance.

87
00:04:28,736 --> 00:04:34,807
I'm giving you a chance to undo
all the evil I've done.

88
00:04:34,809 --> 00:04:37,343
Don't you want that chance?

89
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:55,194
The rare opportunity to go
back in time and right a wrong

90
00:04:55,196 --> 00:04:58,430
and save your mother's life...

91
00:04:58,432 --> 00:05:01,367
quite the paradox Harrison has
presented you with, Mr. Allen.

92
00:05:01,369 --> 00:05:04,570
The chance to be
with someone you love?

93
00:05:04,572 --> 00:05:06,438
Seems pretty cut and dry
to me.

94
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,141
At first blush, Dr. Snow,
it would appear so,

95
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:14,280
but this gift
has unparalleled risk.

96
00:05:14,282 --> 00:05:16,348
Barry, the night
your mother died,

97
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,417
the night you saved yourself
from being killed,

98
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:23,155
that event altered the timeline
you were already on

99
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:25,357
and changed
the course of history.

100
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:28,928
So what you're saying is we're
living in a parallel universe?

101
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:31,096
Just like when
I time traveled before.

102
00:05:31,098 --> 00:05:33,499
But he... he only changed
one day that time.

103
00:05:33,501 --> 00:05:39,371
Exactly. Now imagine 15 years
of compounded experiences.

104
00:05:39,373 --> 00:05:41,640
One different decision,
no matter how big or small,

105
00:05:41,642 --> 00:05:43,943
impacts everything that follows.

106
00:05:43,945 --> 00:05:46,912
Moments upon moments,
choices upon choices.

107
00:05:46,914 --> 00:05:51,383
New relationships,
nothing would be as it is today,

108
00:05:51,385 --> 00:05:52,952
and you'd never know
the difference

109
00:05:52,954 --> 00:05:56,055
because you'd never
remember any of it.

110
00:05:58,224 --> 00:06:02,928
So if I go back
and save my mom,

111
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:06,765
my dad doesn't go to prison.

112
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:10,102
I never live
with Joe and Iris.

113
00:06:10,104 --> 00:06:15,407
You might never meet me.
Or Caitlin or Ronnie.

114
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:19,678
Truth is, there's no real way

115
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,082
of knowing what
your life will be.

116
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:30,923
There's no choice here, Barry.
You have to do this.

117
00:06:30,925 --> 00:06:33,258
You gotta change the past.

118
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:42,067
Joe?

119
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:46,038
So what...
what, that's it?

120
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,607
You think I should
just do it?

121
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:53,512
Yeah, I do.

122
00:06:53,514 --> 00:06:57,049
Which means I will never
come to live with you, and...

123
00:06:57,051 --> 00:06:59,318
you're okay with that?

124
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:03,022
Barry, you get the chance
to grow up with both parents.

125
00:07:03,024 --> 00:07:05,224
You don't have to grow up
without a mother.

126
00:07:05,226 --> 00:07:06,792
What about growing up
without a father?

127
00:07:06,794 --> 00:07:11,497
You will have a father...
your real father.

128
00:07:11,499 --> 00:07:15,701
Wells has messed with our lives
long enough.

129
00:07:15,703 --> 00:07:18,570
This is why you became
The Flash, Barry.

130
00:07:18,572 --> 00:07:20,472
To put things right.

131
00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:25,811
You saved a lot of
people's lives this past year.

132
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:27,646
Now it's time to save yours.

133
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:51,336
Dad, look.
I know this sounds crazy.

134
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:53,806
I think
we're way past crazy, slugger.

135
00:07:53,808 --> 00:07:58,310
Look, you're fast, I get it.
But turning back time...

136
00:07:58,312 --> 00:08:00,679
No, I wouldn't be
turning time back.

137
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:04,316
I would be...
going back

138
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:06,885
to that night to save her.

139
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:10,522
And what does Joe think
about all this?

140
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:14,760
He thinks I should do it.

141
00:08:14,762 --> 00:08:16,795
No.

142
00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:18,363
You can't.

143
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,435
Dad...

144
00:08:23,437 --> 00:08:28,841
I can make it so that night
will never have happened.

145
00:08:28,843 --> 00:08:30,342
We'll be a family again.

146
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:31,844
We are a family.

147
00:08:31,846 --> 00:08:34,513
Not like this.
Not without Mom.

148
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:39,718
Barry, there's a natural order
to things, okay?

149
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,286
Things happen the way they do.

150
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:43,388
We may not know why
at the time,

151
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,524
but there must always be
a reason.

152
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:48,994
Now, I believe that.
I've had to believe it.

153
00:08:48,996 --> 00:08:53,699
I... I can save Mom.

154
00:08:53,701 --> 00:08:56,168
At what cost?

155
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:58,704
You said time would change.
What if it changes you?

156
00:08:58,706 --> 00:09:01,039
- I don't care.
- I do.

157
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,612
I am in awe

158
00:09:06,614 --> 00:09:11,183
of the remarkable man
that you are becoming...

159
00:09:11,185 --> 00:09:14,620
all the things you've achieved,
and not just as The Flash,

160
00:09:14,622 --> 00:09:15,954
but you, Barry.

161
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:18,624
Your honesty.
Your heart.

162
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:23,095
You were always a hero.

163
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,765
And your mom would be
just as proud.

164
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:28,700
And if she had a say in this,

165
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:31,069
if she thought for one second
that you going back to save her

166
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,839
would mean you losing
what makes you so special,

167
00:09:33,841 --> 00:09:36,241
she would never want that.

168
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:42,714
Barry, what I hope for you,

169
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:46,218
maybe the greatest thing that
a father can hope for his son

170
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:51,790
is that one day, you will become
a father yourself.

171
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:53,992
And then you will know...

172
00:09:57,197 --> 00:10:01,533
How much I truly love you.

173
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:09,608
98.6. Normal.

174
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,677
I don't even know
what that word means anymore.

175
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:13,312
Me neither.

176
00:10:13,314 --> 00:10:14,580
I know Barry
really appreciates you

177
00:10:14,582 --> 00:10:16,248
coming back to help him
stop Wells.

178
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,884
That's not the only reason
I'm back, Cait.

179
00:10:18,886 --> 00:10:20,752
I'm here now.
For good.

180
00:10:20,754 --> 00:10:22,321
But I thought...

181
00:10:22,323 --> 00:10:24,856
I thought too...
I thought too much

182
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:27,693
about what might happen if
the government tracked us down.

183
00:10:27,695 --> 00:10:30,162
If we couldn't control
our powers and we hurt someone.

184
00:10:30,164 --> 00:10:33,365
If we hurt you.

185
00:10:33,367 --> 00:10:39,404
But I realized that although
sometimes I'm more than one man,

186
00:10:39,406 --> 00:10:42,074
I'm not whole
unless I'm with you.

187
00:10:42,076 --> 00:10:44,243
I love you, Cait.

188
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,115
- Are you sure?
- I am.

189
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:54,920
Once upon a time and a
Particle Accelerator or so ago,

190
00:10:54,922 --> 00:10:55,921
you agreed to marry me.

191
00:10:55,923 --> 00:10:57,789
Yes, I did.

192
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:00,125
What do you say we do that?

193
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:10,769
Thought I might find you here.

194
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:15,641
I needed to get
out of the lab.

195
00:11:19,647 --> 00:11:21,880
I thought this would be
a good place to think.

196
00:11:21,882 --> 00:11:23,282
Oh, it is.
Trust me.

197
00:11:23,284 --> 00:11:27,319
I've done a lot
of thinking up here.

198
00:11:27,321 --> 00:11:29,054
When I wasn't having
clandestine meetings

199
00:11:29,056 --> 00:11:31,657
with the mysterious
"streak."

200
00:11:33,294 --> 00:11:36,828
Yeah, not mad
we lost that name.

201
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:39,231
Hey, I thought that
had pizzazz.

202
00:11:41,135 --> 00:11:43,502
- No.
- Uh-uh.

203
00:11:49,276 --> 00:11:51,677
So are you gonna do it?

204
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:58,250
It's just so... huge.

205
00:11:58,252 --> 00:11:59,785
It's the biggest decision
of my life,

206
00:11:59,787 --> 00:12:04,022
and if I'm wrong,
I can't undo it.

207
00:12:04,024 --> 00:12:05,691
Why would you want to?

208
00:12:05,693 --> 00:12:11,763
I mean, you'd get to see
your mom again, your dad,

209
00:12:11,765 --> 00:12:14,700
have a great career,

210
00:12:14,702 --> 00:12:17,602
even get married.

211
00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:21,606
Iris West-Allen, huh?

212
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:24,376
I never really thought of myself
as a hyphenator.

213
00:12:24,378 --> 00:12:27,546
Must be a 2024 thing.

214
00:12:27,548 --> 00:12:31,616
We don't know that
that's going to happen.

215
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:37,055
Do you think that because you
didn't live with us,

216
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:39,257
that's why things
are different there?

217
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:42,327
Growing up together and...

218
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:47,466
knowing so much
about each other...

219
00:12:47,468 --> 00:12:51,636
it made it hard for me to admit
how I felt about you.

220
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,742
And I waited too long, and you
fell in love with Eddie.

221
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,849
But living with you
and Joe...

222
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:09,454
I've had a great life, Iris.

223
00:13:11,858 --> 00:13:14,292
Come here, Barry.

224
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:23,135
What do you think
I should do?

225
00:13:23,137 --> 00:13:25,237
I need someone to tell me.

226
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:32,411
I think...

227
00:13:32,413 --> 00:13:36,047
that for once in your life,
Barry Allen,

228
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:38,517
you should stop thinking
about other people.

229
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:41,953
I think you should do
what's in your heart.

230
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:44,489
Do what you need to do
for yourself.

231
00:13:52,098 --> 00:13:54,633
Ah!

232
00:13:54,635 --> 00:13:57,669
Well, if it makes you
feel any better,

233
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:59,237
it took you a whole hour
longer to decide

234
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:00,238
than I thought it would.

235
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,009
So how does this work?

236
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:06,645
Your grand plan?

237
00:14:06,647 --> 00:14:09,014
Well, it's really not
that grand at all, Barry.

238
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:10,682
In fact, it's rather simple.

239
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:12,217
We use
the Particle Accelerator.

240
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:13,685
The Particle Accelerator.

241
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:16,555
The last time that happened,
you caused an explosion

242
00:14:16,557 --> 00:14:18,290
that hurt a lot of people.

243
00:14:18,292 --> 00:14:21,493
This time, the accelerator
will operate exactly

244
00:14:21,495 --> 00:14:23,128
the way it was designed to.

245
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:27,699
Except, instead of two particles
moving in opposite directions,

246
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:29,701
colliding at the speed of light
in the inner ring,

247
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:32,370
we're only going
to inject one particle

248
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,406
into the accelerator.

249
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:37,542
And I'm what
it collides with.

250
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:39,811
And if you can go fast enough,
Barry,

251
00:14:39,813 --> 00:14:43,515
if you can hit that particle
with enough speed,

252
00:14:43,517 --> 00:14:46,718
you will punch a hole right
though the fabric of reality.

253
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,822
And you will create a portal
connecting this time

254
00:14:50,824 --> 00:14:53,558
to infinite times.

255
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,893
A wormhole.

256
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:58,497
Through which one might travel
back to the past, say,

257
00:14:58,499 --> 00:15:02,667
to the night your mother died or
forward to the future, to, say,

258
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:05,270
my time.

259
00:15:05,272 --> 00:15:08,473
You said<i> if</i> I run fast enough.

260
00:15:08,475 --> 00:15:10,075
What happens if I don't?

261
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:13,912
If you don't achieve
the desired velocity barrier,

262
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:15,347
you'll die.

263
00:15:21,554 --> 00:15:23,388
According to
Wells' calculations,

264
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:26,091
Barry super-speeds
inside the accelerator ring.

265
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:28,627
Once Barry
reaches optimum speed,

266
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:32,364
we then launch a hydrogen proton
into the accelerator.

267
00:15:32,366 --> 00:15:35,834
Once the collision happens,
a wormhole forms,

268
00:15:35,836 --> 00:15:40,071
opening a gateway
into time itself.

269
00:15:40,073 --> 00:15:42,474
It's at that moment
I plan on shouting something

270
00:15:42,476 --> 00:15:45,310
along the lines of "Eureka"
or possibly "Excelsior."

271
00:15:45,312 --> 00:15:47,812
I'm uncommitted.

272
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:50,215
What do you think?

273
00:15:50,217 --> 00:15:53,184
I mean, on the one hand,

274
00:15:53,186 --> 00:15:55,220
it does make a kind of sense.

275
00:15:55,222 --> 00:15:56,955
On the other hand,

276
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:58,290
why?

277
00:15:58,292 --> 00:16:01,059
Why, why would you ever
consider doing this?

278
00:16:01,061 --> 00:16:02,627
You know why.

279
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:05,463
So, for this to actually work,
how fast would Barry have to go?

280
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:09,434
By my estimates,
Mach Two at a minimum.

281
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:11,503
You've never gone that fast.

282
00:16:11,505 --> 00:16:14,472
So what happens if Barry
doesn't reach that speed?

283
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:17,008
I mean, I'm imagining a bug
hitting a windshield.

284
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:19,110
How far off am I?

285
00:16:19,112 --> 00:16:21,146
Not very far, I'm afraid.

286
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:24,583
Let me worry about
how fast I have to go.

287
00:16:24,585 --> 00:16:25,750
We're gonna need
something else too.

288
00:16:25,752 --> 00:16:27,819
Really?
And what's that?

289
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:29,688
'Cause I don't know
about you guys,

290
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:33,592
but I'm not at all interested in
helping you get yourself killed.

291
00:16:33,594 --> 00:16:36,962
I need you to build
a time machine.

292
00:16:36,964 --> 00:16:39,464
Go on.

293
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:41,333
So, if Wells is as fast as you,

294
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:43,335
what's he need
a time machine for?

295
00:16:43,337 --> 00:16:45,870
Apparently he lost his speed
when he killed my mom.

296
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:48,607
He gets it back sometimes
but only in spurts.

297
00:16:48,609 --> 00:16:49,874
He can't fully control it.

298
00:16:49,876 --> 00:16:51,309
So I was right
about the wheelchair.

299
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:52,844
He was using it
to charge himself.

300
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:55,146
So after I open the wormhole,
he's gonna need the ship

301
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:57,549
to travel back to the future.

302
00:16:57,551 --> 00:16:59,451
He's been squirreling away
the parts.

303
00:16:59,453 --> 00:17:01,252
Now we just need
to put it together.

304
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:04,456
Ronnie, I love you,
but this is a time machine,

305
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,257
not a bookcase from IKEA.

306
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:07,859
We got a problem.

307
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:09,594
These tiles...
they're made of tungsten.

308
00:17:09,596 --> 00:17:10,962
Well, tungsten does have
the highest melting point

309
00:17:10,964 --> 00:17:12,364
of any other element.

310
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:14,499
Yeah, but the dust
it generates is flammable.

311
00:17:14,501 --> 00:17:16,134
The pressure exerted
from the wormhole...

312
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:17,569
Yeah. Yeah.

313
00:17:17,571 --> 00:17:20,705
It could cause a hole to be
melted into the exterior.

314
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:23,008
It could explode.

315
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:24,643
Any ideas?

316
00:17:24,645 --> 00:17:27,345
Let me ask Dr. Evil.

317
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:30,281
Which used to be
a name that made me smile.

318
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:37,989
Something on your mind,
Cisco?

319
00:17:37,991 --> 00:17:40,191
No.

320
00:17:40,193 --> 00:17:41,393
Yes.

321
00:17:41,395 --> 00:17:44,195
How did you fit
your Reverse-Flash suit

322
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:45,563
into that little ring?

323
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,699
Is it some sort
of compressed micro tech?

324
00:17:47,701 --> 00:17:51,302
Or actually, forget it.
I don't care.

325
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,006
Maybe a little.

326
00:17:55,008 --> 00:17:56,508
Ronnie's right.

327
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,476
I should have accounted
for the temporal shearing.

328
00:17:58,478 --> 00:18:00,779
Glad we're still good
for something.

329
00:18:00,781 --> 00:18:04,783
I never underestimated
your contribution, Cisco.

330
00:18:04,785 --> 00:18:06,017
Or Ronnie's.

331
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:07,619
As a matter of fact,

332
00:18:07,621 --> 00:18:11,289
do you know how many times
I wished you were there with me

333
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:12,624
as I rebuilt the accelerator?

334
00:18:12,626 --> 00:18:13,858
It would have been
a lot more fun.

335
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:14,759
Yeah?

336
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:16,561
Well, doesn't change the fact

337
00:18:16,563 --> 00:18:19,264
that your nifty little
Time Sphere...

338
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:20,665
Is that what you're calling it?

339
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:22,434
Whatever it's called.
It's gonna blow.

340
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:24,436
Not if you cement the tiles
with a cobalt resin.

341
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:27,972
That'll prevent degradation
in conditions of extreme heat.

342
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:30,975
Okay. Fine.
We'll try that.

343
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:32,610
That's it? That's all?

344
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:33,611
Well, what do you
want me to say?

345
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:35,313
I don't know, Cisco.

346
00:18:35,315 --> 00:18:37,048
I thought that of anyone, you'd
be a little more understanding

347
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,016
of my predicament.

348
00:18:38,018 --> 00:18:40,285
I don't belong here.

349
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:43,455
These barbaric times.

350
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:44,989
It's like
living amongst the dead.

351
00:18:44,991 --> 00:18:48,760
Is that what you told yourself?
When you killed me?

352
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:54,065
What?

353
00:18:54,067 --> 00:18:55,567
What did you say?

354
00:18:57,703 --> 00:19:00,105
It was an alternate timeline.

355
00:19:00,107 --> 00:19:02,173
One that Barry reset.

356
00:19:02,175 --> 00:19:03,842
But I never forgot it.

357
00:19:03,844 --> 00:19:07,679
It just kept
coming back to me.

358
00:19:07,681 --> 00:19:10,849
And I can still picture

359
00:19:10,851 --> 00:19:13,251
the way you looked at me

360
00:19:13,253 --> 00:19:15,887
when you called me a son

361
00:19:15,889 --> 00:19:20,992
and you crushed my heart
with your fist.

362
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:24,095
Cisco...

363
00:19:24,097 --> 00:19:25,330
I'm sorry.

364
00:19:25,332 --> 00:19:28,066
Yeah.
It sucked.

365
00:19:28,068 --> 00:19:29,968
Not for killing you.
I'm sure I had a good reason.

366
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:32,137
I'm sorry for the fact that
you're able to retain traces

367
00:19:32,139 --> 00:19:33,705
of another timeline.

368
00:19:33,707 --> 00:19:36,975
You're able to see through
the vibrations of the universe.

369
00:19:36,977 --> 00:19:39,310
It means...

370
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:42,113
I wasn't sure until just now.

371
00:19:42,115 --> 00:19:43,381
Sure of what?

372
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:49,087
The night the Particle
Accelerator exploded...

373
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,526
You were affected too.

374
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:59,564
What are you talking about?

375
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:02,667
No.

376
00:20:05,271 --> 00:20:06,504
I wasn't.

377
00:20:06,506 --> 00:20:09,374
Don't be afraid, Cisco.

378
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:14,846
A great and honorable destiny
awaits you now.

379
00:20:14,848 --> 00:20:20,318
I only hope that as you're
living your great adventure,

380
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,021
that you remember
who gave you that life.

381
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:28,927
And that it was given
out of love.

382
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:45,643
I'm sorry, but I'm told
this is the only station

383
00:20:45,645 --> 00:20:47,912
with enough power
to run these calculations.

384
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:50,081
If we make the slightest error
creating the wormhole...

385
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,549
Say no more.

386
00:20:51,551 --> 00:20:53,051
Joe told me to stick around
in case I was needed,

387
00:20:53,053 --> 00:20:54,485
but it seems
I'm only in the way.

388
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:58,223
Everyone has
a contribution to make.

389
00:20:58,225 --> 00:21:00,758
Perhaps you just haven't
discovered yours yet.

390
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,527
No, Dr. Wells made it
pretty clear when he told me

391
00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:03,995
about the future.

392
00:21:03,997 --> 00:21:05,597
I don't matter.

393
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:06,798
As far as history's concerned,

394
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,901
I don't save the day
or get the girl.

395
00:21:09,903 --> 00:21:12,403
And you believed him?

396
00:21:12,405 --> 00:21:15,673
He had a newspaper
from the year 2024.

397
00:21:15,675 --> 00:21:19,043
And I have a mug that says
"World's Best Boss."

398
00:21:19,045 --> 00:21:22,046
I doubt my teaching assistant
would testify

399
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:25,183
to its authenticity.

400
00:21:25,185 --> 00:21:31,222
We're dealing with a lot
of big scientific ideas today.

401
00:21:31,224 --> 00:21:35,894
But you, Mr. Thawne, might be
the most interesting thing here

402
00:21:35,896 --> 00:21:37,362
at S.T.A.R. Labs.

403
00:21:37,364 --> 00:21:39,130
Me?

404
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:42,467
What are the odds that Dr. Wells
would travel back in time

405
00:21:42,469 --> 00:21:44,669
and get stuck
in the exact same city

406
00:21:44,671 --> 00:21:47,705
as his great-great-great-
great-grandfather?

407
00:21:47,707 --> 00:21:51,075
Working in the same profession,
the same building?

408
00:21:51,077 --> 00:21:54,112
And that part of his plan
to get home would mean

409
00:21:54,114 --> 00:21:58,283
that he'd have to preserve
and protect your life.

410
00:21:58,285 --> 00:22:04,255
That makes you this rare thing
that no scientist can plan for.

411
00:22:04,257 --> 00:22:06,391
Which is?

412
00:22:06,393 --> 00:22:08,626
Coincidence.

413
00:22:08,628 --> 00:22:13,564
There is no science
to coincidence.

414
00:22:13,566 --> 00:22:17,068
You, sir, are an anomaly.

415
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:20,738
A wild card, as it were.

416
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:23,641
You are the only person
in this whole story

417
00:22:23,643 --> 00:22:27,512
who gets to choose
his own future.

418
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:30,448
At least, that's my opinion.

419
00:22:32,252 --> 00:22:34,719
Wait, that can't be right.

420
00:22:34,721 --> 00:22:37,188
Oh, dear.

421
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:39,190
- We have a problem.
- What?

422
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:41,459
The calculations.
There is a danger.

423
00:22:41,461 --> 00:22:43,861
I know.
I'm ready to take the risk.

424
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:46,764
No, not just to you
but to everyone.

425
00:22:46,766 --> 00:22:48,533
Wells didn't tell us everything.

426
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:51,970
Barry, even if you do reach
the right speed,

427
00:22:51,972 --> 00:22:53,905
colliding
with the hydrogen particle,

428
00:22:53,907 --> 00:22:59,143
there is a chance that explosion
could create a singularity.

429
00:22:59,145 --> 00:23:00,144
What's a singularity?

430
00:23:00,146 --> 00:23:01,045
It's a black hole.

431
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:03,114
We could destroy
Central City.

432
00:23:03,116 --> 00:23:04,482
For starters.

433
00:23:04,484 --> 00:23:09,620
If we create a singularity here
and then cannot control it,

434
00:23:09,622 --> 00:23:13,791
we could be looking
at a global catastrophe.

435
00:23:13,793 --> 00:23:17,893
So long and thanks
for all the fish.

436
00:23:22,402 --> 00:23:24,132
Well, sure,
there's a bit of a risk.

437
00:23:24,138 --> 00:23:25,768
I would hardly refer
to possibly causing

438
00:23:25,773 --> 00:23:28,173
an extinction-level event as
"a bit of a risk."

439
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:29,868
Yeah, and your accelerator's

440
00:23:29,876 --> 00:23:32,543
been about as reliable as the
beater I drove in high school.

441
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:34,745
Let me ask you a question.

442
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:38,382
How many meta-humans...

443
00:23:38,384 --> 00:23:39,617
how many dangers...

444
00:23:39,619 --> 00:23:42,987
have we faced
this year together?

445
00:23:42,989 --> 00:23:45,356
Or did you forget that was me

446
00:23:45,358 --> 00:23:47,792
fighting alongside
each and every one of you?

447
00:23:47,794 --> 00:23:50,361
I have been planning this
for almost two decades.

448
00:23:50,363 --> 00:23:51,829
It will work.

449
00:23:51,831 --> 00:23:53,731
And how do we make sure
we don't open a black hole

450
00:23:53,733 --> 00:23:55,166
in the middle
of Central City?

451
00:23:55,168 --> 00:23:57,802
So, once the wormhole
stabilizes,

452
00:23:57,804 --> 00:24:01,739
Barry will have 1 minute
and 52 seconds to alter the past

453
00:24:01,741 --> 00:24:03,608
and return to this time.

454
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:05,309
If and when he does that,

455
00:24:05,311 --> 00:24:07,311
you can close the wormhole,

456
00:24:07,313 --> 00:24:09,313
and we can all live
happily ever after.

457
00:24:09,315 --> 00:24:10,648
Almost two minutes.

458
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:12,750
More than enough time
to save Nora.

459
00:24:12,752 --> 00:24:15,887
But not enough time
to stop you from going home?

460
00:24:15,889 --> 00:24:18,249
Everything's a choice.

461
00:24:18,258 --> 00:24:20,958
- And what if I'm late?
<i>- You won't be.</i>

462
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:22,870
I believe in you, Barry.

463
00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:23,929
Always have.

464
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:25,563
So I guess the question is,

465
00:24:25,565 --> 00:24:28,633
do your friends and family
believe in you as much as I do?

466
00:24:47,854 --> 00:24:52,356
So, if I don't run fast enough
to collide with the particle,

467
00:24:52,358 --> 00:24:54,725
then I'm dust,
and if I do run fast enough

468
00:24:54,727 --> 00:24:56,694
but I'm not back here in time,
then a black hole will form,

469
00:24:56,696 --> 00:24:59,230
swallow up the city
and possibly the world.

470
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,500
You're sure you still want to
look me in the eyes and tell me

471
00:25:02,502 --> 00:25:04,769
this is for the best?

472
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:08,039
I'd be lying
if I told you I did.

473
00:25:10,977 --> 00:25:14,011
Truth is, I don't...
I don't know what to think.

474
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:15,346
I thought
you were the sure one.

475
00:25:15,348 --> 00:25:17,248
I...

476
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:19,150
was kind of banking on that
when I made my decision

477
00:25:19,152 --> 00:25:21,719
the first time.

478
00:25:21,721 --> 00:25:23,721
I was faking it.

479
00:25:23,723 --> 00:25:24,956
Sometimes parents do that.

480
00:25:24,958 --> 00:25:28,125
Most of the time,
parents do that.

481
00:25:30,395 --> 00:25:33,231
Look, of course I'm scared.

482
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:37,668
But I didn't want you to not
help your mother

483
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:39,203
because you were worried
about me.

484
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:41,772
Well, I'll always worry
about you, Joe,

485
00:25:41,774 --> 00:25:44,008
just like you'll always worry
about me.

486
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:46,711
Sorry,
but you can't stop that.

487
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,919
Do you think I can do this?

488
00:25:54,921 --> 00:25:58,089
You think I can save my mom?

489
00:25:58,091 --> 00:26:00,024
I mean, do you think
I'm fast enough?

490
00:26:00,026 --> 00:26:01,092
Yes.

491
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,128
I know you are.

492
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:12,536
You know, I've... I've dreamed
my whole life about...

493
00:26:12,538 --> 00:26:14,905
saving her,

494
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:18,309
freeing my dad, and...

495
00:26:18,311 --> 00:26:20,711
I never thought I'd have to lose
another parent to do that.

496
00:26:20,713 --> 00:26:21,979
Barry...

497
00:26:21,981 --> 00:26:25,283
Joe, it's true.
It's true.

498
00:26:25,285 --> 00:26:27,952
I've always been
so focused on everything

499
00:26:27,954 --> 00:26:33,257
that I lost that night,
but I gained so much too.

500
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:38,095
I was born with one father,
and that tragedy gave me...

501
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:39,830
another.

502
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:44,468
And I don't think
I can lose you.

503
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:47,204
You won't ever lose me.

504
00:26:47,206 --> 00:26:50,207
Ever, you hear me?

505
00:26:50,209 --> 00:26:52,009
Ever.

506
00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:01,719
Wow, slow news day?

507
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:07,258
If they only knew, right?

508
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:10,728
I thought you would be
at S.T.A.R. Labs.

509
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:12,196
I was.

510
00:27:12,198 --> 00:27:14,432
Then I got hungry,
so I went to Mama Chows.

511
00:27:14,434 --> 00:27:17,735
For dim sum?
Your favorite.

512
00:27:17,737 --> 00:27:20,104
And to remind myself
of something.

513
00:27:20,106 --> 00:27:20,806
What?

514
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:29,914
A coincidence. A pretty big
coincidence, actually.

515
00:27:29,916 --> 00:27:33,751
About a year and a half ago,
I had a date with this girl.

516
00:27:33,753 --> 00:27:37,588
Katie Rogers.
She was a dancer.

517
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:39,824
We had plans to meet
at Mama Chows,

518
00:27:39,826 --> 00:27:41,158
but she texted me.

519
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,626
She pulled a hamstring
and had to cancel.

520
00:27:42,628 --> 00:27:45,196
Oh, those fragile dancers.

521
00:27:45,198 --> 00:27:49,533
I was bummed 'cause I was
looking forward to it.

522
00:27:49,535 --> 00:27:52,603
So I had dinner by myself,
and I was walking home

523
00:27:52,605 --> 00:27:56,807
when I saw a mugger
running with a stolen backpack.

524
00:27:56,809 --> 00:27:58,576
Your backpack.

525
00:27:58,578 --> 00:28:01,512
And I arrested him.

526
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:04,148
That's how you and I met.

527
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:06,650
I remember.

528
00:28:06,652 --> 00:28:09,720
Someone just told me how
powerful a coincidence can be,

529
00:28:09,722 --> 00:28:13,824
and it made me realize how many
coincidences had to happen

530
00:28:13,826 --> 00:28:16,727
for you and I to get together...

531
00:28:16,729 --> 00:28:19,964
in this time.

532
00:28:19,966 --> 00:28:23,734
We've all been so focused on
Barry's destiny,

533
00:28:23,736 --> 00:28:26,804
I forgot that I have one too.

534
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:32,710
And it's you.

535
00:28:32,712 --> 00:28:35,846
Iris West,

536
00:28:35,848 --> 00:28:40,551
every moment of my life
led to meeting you.

537
00:28:43,422 --> 00:28:45,156
Screw the future.

538
00:28:47,827 --> 00:28:49,894
Screw the future.

539
00:28:55,802 --> 00:28:57,601
Is this actually binding?

540
00:28:57,603 --> 00:29:01,372
My father made me become a rabbi
before he would send me to MIT.

541
00:29:01,374 --> 00:29:04,341
This will be "legit,"
as the kids say.

542
00:29:04,343 --> 00:29:05,776
No kids say that.

543
00:29:05,778 --> 00:29:06,977
Let's not fight
on our wedding day.

546
00:29:14,854 --> 00:29:17,521
If it's all right with everyone,
I'd like to skip all the Hebrew.

547
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:21,325
I've learned a lot

548
00:29:21,327 --> 00:29:24,695
about merging one's life
with another this past year.

549
00:29:24,697 --> 00:29:28,499
Yet, for all the incredible
advancements in science

550
00:29:28,501 --> 00:29:30,100
we've all been party to,

551
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:33,871
the mystery that brings
two people together through love

552
00:29:33,873 --> 00:29:36,607
is still the province of magic.

553
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:38,209
Mr. Ramon,

I owe you a real ring.

559
00:29:52,959 --> 00:29:54,859
I don't need one.

560
00:29:54,861 --> 00:29:58,262
I have everything
and everyone

561
00:29:58,264 --> 00:30:02,199
that I could ever need
right here.

562

And...

563
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:05,169
if all the events
of the past year

564
00:30:05,171 --> 00:30:08,739
have led us to this moment,

565
00:30:08,741 --> 00:30:11,809
it was worth it.

566
00:30:11,811 --> 00:30:14,044
I love you, Ronnie.

567
00:30:14,046 --> 00:30:16,380
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

568
00:30:16,382 --> 00:30:17,948
You may kiss the bride.

569
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:19,416

There are gonna be three yous
back there...

577
00:30:46,579 --> 00:30:48,145
the you from the future

578
00:30:48,147 --> 00:30:49,547
who saved younger you
from the Reverse-Flash

579
00:30:49,549 --> 00:30:50,881
and now<i> you</i> you.

580
00:30:50,883 --> 00:30:54,818
Remember, wait until future you
gets younger you out of there,

581
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:57,354
and then you can go
and save your mom.

582
00:30:57,356 --> 00:30:59,823
Piece of cake.

583
00:30:59,825 --> 00:31:02,159
May the Speed Force
be with you.

584
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:08,899
Good-bye, Dad.

585
00:31:13,405 --> 00:31:15,072
Good-bye, Son.

586
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:18,342
Iris...

587
00:31:18,344 --> 00:31:21,011
You don't have
to say anything.

588
00:31:21,013 --> 00:31:22,613
I already know.

589
00:31:27,586 --> 00:31:30,988
I hope whatever life you get,
it's enough for you.

590
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:33,157
That it makes you happy.

591
00:31:33,159 --> 00:31:34,258
You too.

592
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:56,580
Remember, Mr. Allen,

593
00:31:56,582 --> 00:31:59,249
assuming you achieve the proper
velocity and open the wormhole,

594
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:02,419
you will only have
1 minute and 52 seconds

595
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:04,455
to save your mother
and return.

596
00:32:04,457 --> 00:32:05,456
Or else...

597
00:32:05,458 --> 00:32:06,924
I know.

598
00:32:10,195 --> 00:32:12,262
Well...

599
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:15,966
you hold both our futures
in your hands now, Mr. Allen.

600
00:32:15,968 --> 00:32:18,602
And I know you can do it.

601
00:32:18,604 --> 00:32:19,937
Now...

602
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,740
Run...

603
00:32:22,742 --> 00:32:24,842
Barry.

604
00:32:24,844 --> 00:32:26,143
Run.

605
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:37,921
The accelerator's structural
integrity is holding.

606
00:32:37,923 --> 00:32:39,757
What was that?

607
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:40,958
Is Barry okay?

608
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,395
Yeah.
He just passed Mach Two.

609
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:56,440
I was waiting for you
to bring Barry home.

610
00:32:56,442 --> 00:33:00,377
Looks like he's going to be
staying with us for a while.

611
00:33:00,379 --> 00:33:02,813
Barry, what you're seeing is
the Speed Force:

612
00:33:02,815 --> 00:33:05,983
your past, your present,
your future

613
00:33:05,985 --> 00:33:07,518
all at once.

614
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:11,121
So you need to focus
on where you want to go.

615
00:33:11,123 --> 00:33:13,590
So think about...

616
00:33:13,592 --> 00:33:15,622
that night.

617
00:33:15,628 --> 00:33:19,128
Think about your mother.

618
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:23,332
Time for bed.
Good night, slugger.

619
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:25,835
Mom!

620
00:33:29,274 --> 00:33:30,708
It's working.

621
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:35,179
It's working.

622
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:39,049
Inject the hydrogen particle
now.

623
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:44,788
What's that?
What happened?

624
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:46,056
Barry... he's gone.

625
00:33:46,058 --> 00:33:47,925
- Look.
- The wormhole.

626
00:33:47,927 --> 00:33:49,693
And it's stable.
Start the clock.

627
00:34:08,814 --> 00:34:11,281
Mom!

628
00:34:11,283 --> 00:34:12,783
Mom!

629
00:34:12,785 --> 00:34:13,784
Barry!

630
00:34:13,786 --> 00:34:15,519
Mom!

631
00:34:19,125 --> 00:34:21,091
Nora! Hold on!

632
00:34:28,934 --> 00:34:33,670
Run, Barry, run!

633
00:34:34,873 --> 00:34:37,808
Barry, no!

634
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:42,412
No, no, no!

635
00:35:04,937 --> 00:35:08,038
Hey. It's okay.
It's okay. You're okay.

636
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,307
Please. My husband,
my son, are they...

637
00:35:10,309 --> 00:35:12,109
They're okay.

638
00:35:12,111 --> 00:35:13,644
They're both safe.

639
00:35:13,646 --> 00:35:16,413
I promise.

640
00:35:16,415 --> 00:35:18,448
Who are you?

641
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,717
I'm...

642
00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:25,856
I'm The Flash.

643
00:35:25,858 --> 00:35:27,624
I don't understand.

644
00:35:40,104 --> 00:35:42,673
You look just like my father.

645
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:51,148
This won't make any sense,

646
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:53,617
but it's me, Mom.

647
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,486
It's Barry.

648
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:57,487
Barry?

649
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:58,922
Your Barry.

650
00:35:58,924 --> 00:36:00,691
Oh, my beautiful boy.

651
00:36:05,231 --> 00:36:07,764
I got a second chance

652
00:36:07,766 --> 00:36:10,767
to come back here and...

653
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:16,340
Tell you that I'm okay.

654
00:36:16,342 --> 00:36:20,277
Dad and I are both okay.

655
00:36:20,279 --> 00:36:24,014
And we love you, Mom.

656
00:36:24,016 --> 00:36:26,617
I love you.

657
00:36:26,619 --> 00:36:29,119
I love you.

658
00:36:29,121 --> 00:36:32,556
Oh, my sweet boy.

659
00:36:32,558 --> 00:36:35,826
Bye. Good-bye.

660
00:36:35,828 --> 00:36:39,162
Good-bye, Barry.

661
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:42,332
Mom.

662
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:45,269
Mom.

663
00:37:06,792 --> 00:37:10,494
I believe it's time to
say good-bye to Harrison Wells.

664
00:37:16,768 --> 00:37:18,468
It's beautiful.

665
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:21,405
Rip Hunter would
be impressed.

666
00:37:21,407 --> 00:37:23,607
He built
the first one of these.

667
00:37:23,609 --> 00:37:25,242
Interesting man.

668
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:31,415
Now what the hell is that?

669
00:37:31,417 --> 00:37:33,617
That's my cue to leave.

670
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:39,156
Thank you, Cisco.

671
00:37:39,158 --> 00:37:41,191
Don't ever come back.

672
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:06,783
30 seconds.

673
00:38:14,826 --> 00:38:16,426
Home.

674
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,574
- Oh, my God.
- Barry.

675
00:38:30,576 --> 00:38:32,876
We have to shut down
the wormhole quickly!

676
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:35,745
Caitlin!

677
00:38:42,588 --> 00:38:44,588
You didn't save her.

678
00:38:44,757 --> 00:38:46,057
Why?

679
00:38:46,492 --> 00:38:47,692
Why?

680
00:38:47,693 --> 00:38:50,327
You could have had
the life you wanted.

681
00:38:50,329 --> 00:38:53,563
You could have had
everything you ever wanted!

682
00:38:54,932 --> 00:38:56,600
I already do.

683
00:39:00,738 --> 00:39:02,339
Not for long.

684
00:39:05,576 --> 00:39:07,477
Cut the internal generators.

685
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:11,748
Ten seconds, hurry.

686
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:28,765
Three, two, one.

687
00:39:30,435 --> 00:39:32,069
Ronnie, are you okay?

688
00:39:32,071 --> 00:39:33,403
Did you do it?

689
00:39:33,405 --> 00:39:34,905
Yes, I turned them all off.

690
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:39,910
They did it.
They cut the generator.

691
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:46,383
Just so we're clear,

692
00:39:46,385 --> 00:39:47,818
after I kill you,

693
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,486
I'm going to kill them.

694
00:39:49,488 --> 00:39:51,755
And then I'm going
to kill your father.

695
00:39:51,757 --> 00:39:54,925
I always win, Flash.

696
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:04,000
Eddie! Oh, my...

697
00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:06,703
Eddie!

698
00:40:06,705 --> 00:40:08,338
What did you do?

699
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:14,578
What did you do?
What did you do?

700
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:17,447
No such thing
as a coincidence.

701
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:21,785
What's happening?

702
00:40:21,787 --> 00:40:23,420
Cisco, help me.

703
00:40:23,422 --> 00:40:25,989
Eddie's his ancestor.

704
00:40:25,991 --> 00:40:28,658
If Eddie dies,
he'll never be born, and...

705
00:40:30,394 --> 00:40:32,963
He's being erased
from existence.

706
00:40:35,066 --> 00:40:38,335
No! No!
Eddie.

707
00:40:38,337 --> 00:40:39,936
Eddie, no, no.

708
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:43,006
Stay with me, okay?
Stay.

709
00:40:44,176 --> 00:40:46,676
He was wrong, it turns out.

710
00:40:46,678 --> 00:40:48,378
I'm a hero after all.

711
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:51,448
You are, Eddie.
You are my hero.

712
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:54,851
That's all
I ever wanted to be.

713
00:40:54,853 --> 00:40:56,419
Your hero.

714
00:41:02,727 --> 00:41:04,261
No!

715
00:41:10,903 --> 00:41:13,603
I've controlled your life
for so long, Barry.

716
00:41:13,605 --> 00:41:16,673
How will you get along
without me?

717
00:41:42,934 --> 00:41:45,235
Guys, that's not good.

718
00:41:45,237 --> 00:41:46,736
Professor, I shut down
the wormhole.

719
00:41:46,738 --> 00:41:48,872
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

720
00:41:48,874 --> 00:41:51,441
You did close it,
but it seems to be reopening.

721
00:41:51,443 --> 00:41:53,009
We got to go.

722
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:55,412
You okay?

723
00:41:55,414 --> 00:41:56,846
Iris, we have to go.

724
00:41:56,848 --> 00:41:59,516
I'm not leaving him.

725
00:41:59,518 --> 00:42:02,085
We have to go now, honey.
I'm sorry.

726
00:42:18,102 --> 00:42:20,337
So that's what
we didn't want to happen.

727
00:42:20,339 --> 00:42:22,072
- What's it doing?
- Feeding.

728
00:42:22,074 --> 00:42:26,443
A singularity won't stop, not
even after the earth is gone.

729
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:49,165
I'm afraid the accretion disc
has already assembled.

730
00:42:49,167 --> 00:42:50,166
What?

731
00:42:50,168 --> 00:42:51,601
The diffuse material

732
00:42:51,603 --> 00:42:53,370
that's in orbital motion
around the singularity.

733
00:42:53,372 --> 00:42:54,404
What does that mean?

734
00:42:54,406 --> 00:42:56,239
We have to disrupt the motion.

735
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:59,509
Basically it's just like
the tornado, only upside down.

736
00:42:59,511 --> 00:43:01,111
And bigger.

737
00:43:01,113 --> 00:43:02,746
And scarier.

738
00:43:02,748 --> 00:43:04,581
Barry, that event
has an energy level

739
00:43:04,583 --> 00:43:07,117
of at least
6.7 Tera Electron Volts.

740
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:08,585
It cannot be stopped.

741
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:14,591
I have to try.

742
00:43:38,215 --> 00:43:39,215
Oh, God.

743
00:43:39,217 --> 00:43:41,318
Barry.

744
00:44:25,396 --> 00:44:26,996
Move your head.
