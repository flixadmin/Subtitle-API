1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
- <i>Previously, on</i> Gotham...
- <i>The guys call him the Ogre.</i>

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,520
<i>He's a serial killer.</i>

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,200
Whoever did this, he's a monster.

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,840
The blood of his next victim
is on my hands.

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,560
If you don't drop it,
that blood could be Lee's.

6
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,160
<i>Because the Ogre retaliates
against any cop</i>

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,160
<i>who investigates him,
kills the people they love.</i>

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,480
The man who stabbed Alfred,

9
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,320
- he's in Gotham.
- And you need my help to find him.

10
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,520
Who sent you?

11
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,040
You want me to tell Bunderslaw
that you're onto?

12
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,560
Hey.

13
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,760
You look far from home.

14
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,640
Get away from him.

15
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,840
Or what?

16
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,240
Whatever.

17
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,400
Come on.

18
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,480
- Did you go back?
- Yeah, the cops are there.

19
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,400
And?

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,840
And what do you think?

21
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,240
He fell out of a five-storey window.
He's dead.

22
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,040
Why did you do it?

23
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,240
He'd told us what we wanted.
He told us about Bunderslaw.

24
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,320
- You didn't have to...
- Yes, I did!

25
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,960
Because the moment we'd left,
he was gonna go and tell his boss

26
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,160
who works for you, by the way.

27
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,360
He's the one who tried to kill me,

28
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,960
who tried to kill your butler,

29
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,960
who probably killed your parents.

30
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,000
I saved your life.

31
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:44,160
Besides, you wanted to do it too,
you just didn't have the guts.

32
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,120
- Wait.
- Just go home.

33
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,200
We still have to find out
who Bunderslaw is and what he wants.

34
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,680
You mean you do.

35
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:56,240
You really think this is over?
He's going come after us.

36
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,280
So, what's next?

37
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,360
- His safe.
- What?

38
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,560
Ev... Every senior executive
at Wayne Enterprises

39
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,720
has a safe in their office.

40
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,880
Any... Any secrets Bunderslaw has,
that's where they'll be.

41
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,160
Key or combination?

42
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,520
Key.

43
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,800
My dad had one.

44
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,520
He'll probably keep it
on him then.

45
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,600
Figure out a way to get me close
and I'll steal it.

46
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,480
- Can you do that?
- I think so.

47
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,800
And what happened tonight,
you tell no one.

48
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,600
Not your buddy Detective Gordon,
not your butler.

49
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,960
No, one.

50
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,400
{\an5}Punctures on test subject
are consistent

51
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,920
{\an5}with those on the victim,

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,480
{\an5}indicating
the killer was right-handed.

53
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,400
{\an5}Yum.

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,800
{\an5}- Where's Thompkins?
- Detective Gordon.

55
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,760
{\an5}Dr. Thompkins said,
I was free to use her office.

56
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,680
{\an5}She's very nice. She's not like
the old Medical Examiner...

57
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,000
Ed, just tell me where she is.

58
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,360
No, riddles.

59
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,880
Home. She went home.

60
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,680
Hope you find her.

61
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,560
Jim?

62
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,760
{\an5}Jim, is that you?

63
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,240
{\an5}You're lucky I don't skin you.

64
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,920
Go home.

65
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,760
- All right, slow down.
- Lee, please.

66
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,080
{\an5}Start over.

67
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,920
{\an5}This case you caught,
the dead woman,

68
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,840
{\an5}she was murdered
by a serial killer?

69
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,120
{\an5}Yes, he's killed a dozen women,
maybe more.

70
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,400
{\an5}And Loeb gave you this
on purpose?

71
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,480
{\an5}He wants to hurt me.

72
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,040
{\an5}And how am I in danger?

73
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:03,120
{\an5}He murders the loved ones
of any cop who investigates him.

74
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,720
So he's been able
to get away with it so far.

75
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,680
{\an5}Any cop who's come after him,
he's killed someone they love,

76
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,280
{\an5}and the investigation's
been buried.

77
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,920
{\an5}Bullock knows a cop who came home
and found his wife

78
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,680
her throat had been cut.

79
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,160
{\an5}That's why Loeb gave me the case.

80
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,880
Either I give up
like everyone else,

81
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,400
and live knowing
I let her killer go free

82
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,160
or I keep on...

83
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,160
And someone I love is killed.

84
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,560
- You're not giving up, are you?
- I can't.

85
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,480
That's why I need you
to get out of Gotham right now.

86
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,840
Tonight.

87
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,760
No.

88
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,000
You want to protect me?
Find him.

89
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,120
I'm going to stay here
and do my job.

90
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,240
But I do like that you think of me
as a loved one.

91
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,480
I do.

92
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,560
I love you.

93
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,280
You know, it took a serial killer
to get you to say that.

94
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,560
Thanks.

95
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,640
Hi.

96
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,560
This is it.

97
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,240
Home sweet, you know.

98
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,840
This is a great space.

99
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,600
Selina?

100
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,240
Sort of a roommate.

101
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,640
She comes and goes.

102
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,920
Wayne Enterprises Charity Ball.

103
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,280
Didn't you know
I'm a member of society?

104
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,840
I go every year.

105
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,440
Get my picture taken
in a pretty dress.

106
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,280
Smile.

107
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,960
Aren't you scared
of my being here?

108
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,040
Should I be?

109
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,040
Are you dangerous?

110
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,320
I don't know. Is your boyfriend
gonna come home?

111
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,960
I never said, I had a boyfriend.

112
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,400
I assumed a woman
as beautiful as you.

113
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,000
You assumed I had a boyfriend

114
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,400
and you assumed
that I would be the kind of woman

115
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,080
who would cheat on him.

116
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,680
Well, I'm not.
And I don't have a boyfriend.

117
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,080
If a bus hit me tomorrow,

118
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,720
no one would care.

119
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,960
Does that change things?

120
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,640
- Yes, actually, it does.
- Yeah, make it more illicit?

121
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,360
Or would there be less chance
of us getting attached?

122
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,200
One night and done.

123
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,720
Only that would happen anyway.

124
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,440
Because once you saw the real me,

125
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,960
you would run screaming
like everyone else.

126
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,080
I have to say, you're not
who I imagined you'd be.

127
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,240
Surprise.

128
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,920
You can let yourself out.

129
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,760
But you promised
to dance with me.

130
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,600
And I will.

131
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,680
But first I have to finish
with that gentleman.

132
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,040
Who knew running a nightclub
was so much work?

133
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,000
My poor darling.

134
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,560
As I was saying,

135
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:33,040
you and your crew are the best gun
and knifemen in the city.

136
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,560
Your hit on Councilman Klien,

137
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,160
a thing of beauty.

138
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,440
- And I'm a fan.
- Cheers.

139
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,680
What do you want?

140
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,040
For you to help me
kill Don Maroni

141
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,440
- and all of his lieutenants.
- You're having a laugh.

142
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,840
I'm fairly certain I'm not.

143
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,840
And Falcone's good with this?

144
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,360
He will be.
When it's done.

145
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,360
Thank you.

146
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,440
No, thank you.

147
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,360
So you like being number two.

148
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,760
Falcone gives victor's ass
first dibs on every new contract.

149
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,600
You bring him the bullet-riddled
corpse of his enemy,

150
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,240
and all of that will change.

151
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,160
This is your chance to move up.

152
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,360
You're a mad fellow, aren't you?

153
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,240
Fair enough.

154
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,520
Come by the barge tomorrow,

155
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,800
we'll talk details.

156
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,920
- What's this about, Harvey?
- Have a seat.

157
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,440
- This is my partner, Jim Gordon.
- Detective.

158
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,360
Eight years ago,
you investigated the murder

159
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,960
woman named Julie Kemble.

160
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,720
- It was a long time ago.
- It was the Ogre.

161
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,720
Julie Kemble was his first victim.

162
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,520
But you dropped
the investigation,

163
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,280
because of that,
11 more women have been murdered.

164
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,240
- Seriously, guys, you know...
- Stop.

165
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,360
We also know
the Ogre kills the loved ones

166
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,880
of the cops that hunt him down.

167
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,440
That pattern started with you.

168
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,240
We think you found something
that spooked him.

169
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,240
Your notes
from the investigation.

170
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,160
The last page,
something's been scratched out.

171
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,640
I want to know what.

172
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,640
He killed my wife.

173
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,400
I still got a daughter, Harvey.

174
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,160
Beth Tudor.

175
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,520
Katherine Wood.

176
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,480
Jessica Parker.
11 women.

177
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,360
Each one was someone's daughter.

178
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,880
It has to stop.

179
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,200
Yeah, I was doing background
on the dead girl.

180
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:47,480
Someone told me she was a nurse
for a private medical clinic uptown.

181
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:51,320
Some Grant and 80th.
Some cosmetic place.

182
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,720
We'll put cops on your daughter
till this is done.

183
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,160
So, you forgive me?

184
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,400
I'll see you tonight.

185
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,360
- How's it hanging, Riddle Man?
- It's hanging...

186
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,240
Fine.

187
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,600
Mr. Nygma.

188
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,920
- Did you need something?
- Oh, yes.

189
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,200
Detective Gordon want me to go
through the forensic evidence

190
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,960
- of these old murders.
- Okay.

191
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,200
Are those bruises?

192
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,480
Did Officer Dougherty do that?

193
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,640
He was upset
and he didn't mean to.

194
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,240
I... I said some things
I shouldn't have...

195
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,600
Miss Kringle, this is not right.

196
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,200
- He can't just...
- Mr. Nygma.

197
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,240
It is none of your concern.

198
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:06,320
Now, I... I need to get started
on these files, so...

199
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,120
Alfred. Should you be up?

200
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,720
Oh, thank you, Master Bruce.
I feel, feel much better.

201
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,360
- Can I get you anything?
- Yes, actually.

202
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,560
I've decided to attend

203
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,240
the Wayne Enterprises Charity Ball
tonight.

204
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,560
All the senior management
will be there,

205
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,640
and I think people should see

206
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,560
that a Wayne is still at the head
of the company.

207
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,520
I shall set your tux out for you.

208
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,800
- Alfred.
- Yes, Master Bruce?

209
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,400
When... When you were
in the army...

210
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,840
You had to kill people, right?

211
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,440
Yes.

212
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,440
Yes, I did.

213
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,840
And it was necessary.

214
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,040
Oh, I see,
so you overheard the conversation

215
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,360
that Reggie and I had
that was best left unsaid,

216
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,120
but to answer your question, yes.

217
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,640
Yes, it was necessary.

218
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,240
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I better go

219
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,000
and find my good cufflinks
if we're stepping out.

220
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:26,160
No, but you, you...
You're still recovering.

221
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,920
What, I'm supposed to let you
walk into that nest of vipers?

222
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,720
There'll be 100's of people there,
Alfred.

223
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,880
I won't be in any danger.

224
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,920
So you say,
but you're not gonna go alone.

225
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,520
I won't be alone.

226
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,040
And I've invited Selina Kyle.

227
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,360
Selina Kyle?

228
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,360
To the Wayne Enterprises Ball?

229
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,040
I see.

230
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,160
- What do you see?
- Nothing.

231
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,040
I mean, you know, I mean,
you are a healthy young lad

232
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,360
and she's a very pretty
young girl

233
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,480
with a penchant of wearing
a little too much leather.

234
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,000
- Alfred, it's not like that.
- Then what is it like?

235
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,000
Well.

236
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,720
What if it is?
What's wrong with that?

237
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,000
Absolutely nothing.

238
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,480
So I will wait in the car outside

239
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,640
so you don't feel
my watchful eye.

240
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,080
But I will be close by
if there needs be.

241
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:23,000
- That is the deal.
- Fine.

242
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,880
Could you call around
and send some dresses and shoes

243
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,080
to where she's staying?

244
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,160
This is the address.

245
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,080
It's a charity ball, Alfred.

246
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,600
I'll be fine.

247
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,000
Freaky?

248
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,640
You wonder how they recognize
themselves after.

249
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,200
Doc Thompkins is fine.

250
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,360
No, one's gonna touch her
at the precinct. Relax.

251
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,160
You do understand
it's because of me

252
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,280
that she's in danger.

253
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,400
Anything that happens,
it's my fault.

254
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,880
You can't hold yourself responsible
for the actions of a psychopath.

255
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,680
Sure I can.

256
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,000
Detectives.

257
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,160
I'm Dr. Cushman,
how can I help you?

258
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,960
We're looking into the murder
of a woman named Julie Kemble.

259
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,440
She worked here
about eight years ago.

260
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,840
Of course.
Terrible thing.

261
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,040
Julie was a talented nurse.

262
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,720
But she'd only just started here
when it happened.

263
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,840
She'd been recommended
by one of our patients.

264
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,600
The patient's name?

265
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:30,120
I'm afraid I can't give you that.
Confidentiality.

266
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,240
Really?

267
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,080
You're going to make us
get a warrant?

268
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,360
Yes.

269
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,680
I specialize in fake boobs,
but I got ethics.

270
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,800
I need a warrant.

271
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,960
We'll talk to Judge Harkness,
I'm sure.

272
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,520
That car was in front
of the precinct.

273
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Jim, wait up.

274
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,240
- You're sure about this?
- It was him.

275
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,360
- You saw his face?
- No.

276
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,760
I should've been looking
for a tail.

277
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,680
It's obvious
he tracks our investigations.

278
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,040
We called in a description
of the car and a partial plate,

279
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,680
- but I'm not too hopeful.
- So, what's the next move?

280
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,080
Gordon. You got a call.
Says, it's urgent.

281
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,720
- Gordon.
<i>- Detective.</i>

282
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,320
I didn't get a chance
to say hello properly in the alley.

283
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,960
- Listen to me.
<i>- Don't bother tracing this.</i>

284
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,200
<i>I won't be long.</i>

285
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,640
I'm giving you one chance
to turn yourself in.

286
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,720
Make me come after you,
and I will put you down.

287
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:45,720
Something tells me you've begun
to buy your own press, Detective.

288
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,880
<i>The hero cop
who's going to clean up Gotham.</i>

289
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:51,040
The rising star of the G.C.P.D.

290
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,840
I'll stop you,
that's for damn sure.

291
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,240
No, Detective, you won't.

292
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,080
But keep on your present course,
and I will kill someone you love.

293
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,280
This is your only warning.

294
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,320
Oh, no.

295
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,080
Tell me that wasn't him.

296
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,320
He's used to intimidating cops.

297
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,600
We have to show him
we're not afraid.

298
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,800
And how do we do that?

299
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,080
You're okay with this?
You're sure?

300
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,880
Yes.
It's the right thing to do.

301
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,920
I called you here today,

302
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,080
because the people of Gotham
deserve to know

303
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,960
that there's a serial killer
in their midst.

304
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,120
For years,
he's killed with impunity,

305
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,520
aided by a culture of silence
and fear among the police.

306
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,520
That ends now.

307
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,040
We'll be providing the names
and photos of all the victims.

308
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,120
Please call with any information.

309
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,640
And to the man who committed
these horrific crimes,

310
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,080
<i>your days of hiding are over.</i>

311
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,000
<i>I'm coming after you.</i>

312
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,400
And I am not going to stop.

313
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,160
- What are those for?
- The Wayne Charity Ball.

314
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:23,280
It's boring but good
for the galleries business.

315
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,880
Well,
I'll probably see you there.

316
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,480
What?

317
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:31,000
- I'm going with Bruce Wayne.
- Wait, what?

318
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,920
Delivery for Selina Kyle.

319
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,760
Over there.

320
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,600
Thank you. Enjoy.

321
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,760
Thanks.

322
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,200
Am I really supposed
to wear these?

323
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,080
Okay.
We have a lot of work to do.

324
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,840
Got it. That was the doctor.

325
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,240
Harkness sent over the warrant.
The dead girl came to the clinic

326
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,880
by way
of a Miss Constance van Groot.

327
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,440
Van Groot.

328
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,800
That's one of Gotham's
oldest families.

329
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,920
- Shipping.
- Yeah.

330
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,200
You thought
the Ogre might be rich.

331
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,960
Could be the old lady had a son.

332
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,920
- You got an address?
- Right here.

333
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,640
Well, Butch, Connor
and his crew are onboard.

334
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,760
They hate Maroni even more...
- Shut up.

335
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:32,160
Maroni and his crew are here.
I couldn't turn them away.

336
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,240
- No, of course. No, matter.
- No, she was already here.

337
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,920
Is that my buddy, Oswald?

338
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,800
- Come here.
- Oh, Oswald.

339
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,120
There he is.

340
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,200
Mother, what are you doing?

341
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,480
I'm having a drink with Mr. Mar...

342
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,720
I told you. Sal.

343
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,880
With Sal.

344
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,400
But we shouldn't impose
any longer.

345
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,960
No, you're not taking my Gertrud.

346
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,720
Oh, his Gertrud.

347
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,000
Sit. Join us.

348
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:16,160
- Oswald, sit.
- Sit, Oswald.

349
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,360
Hello.

350
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,160
- I'm Bruce Wayne.
- Barbara Kean.

351
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,760
Selina never said,
you're who she was staying with.

352
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,200
Detective Gordon spoke of you.

353
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,640
Well, Selina can be
a little bit guarded.

354
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,120
- Yes, I know.
- Stop talking about me.

355
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,640
Selina.

356
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:51,120
- You look very nice.
- The shoes hurt.

357
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,000
Have fun.
Look for me at the ball.

358
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,240
It was nice meeting you.

359
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,120
Think she's here?

360
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,120
Miss van Groot.

361
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,600
G.C.P.D.

362
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:15,360
I need to say,
this is not exactly legal.

363
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,960
We're running out of time.

364
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,160
Over here.

365
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,360
He's good.

366
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,200
Call it in. I'm gonna go check
the rest of the house.

367
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:55,240
He told me.
But I was too slow.

368
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,040
Hello?

369
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,120
Miss van Groot?

370
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,400
I'm a police officer.

371
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,400
Miss van Groot?

372
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,440
Gordon!

373
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,480
Jim!

374
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,800
Jim Gordon.

375
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,440
Constance van Groot.

376
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,760
Okay, charming!

377
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,600
Every one staring at us.

378
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,720
Well, I am Bruce Wayne.

379
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,680
Well, I am.

380
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,360
Anyway, I don't see Bunderslaw
anywhere.

381
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,200
- Did you see this?
- He's probably not coming.

382
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,920
Well, he's on the guest list.

383
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,240
Just keep dancing.

384
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,840
And smile, maybe.

385
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,960
Name's Jacob Skolimski.

386
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,920
He's not talking,
but near as we can tell,

387
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,120
he was the old lady's butler.

388
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,880
And you're thinking
the Ogre's this guy's son,

389
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,680
- not the dead woman's.
<i>- Yeah, yeah.</i>

390
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,600
<i>Coroner said, the old bird's
been dead for years.</i>

391
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,840
My guess, Ogre killed her,
daddy pretends she's still alive

392
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,680
so his crazy serial killer son
can keep living off her money.

393
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,200
He tried to kill himself.

394
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,440
He knew you were closing in.

395
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,280
He has to be in contact
with his son.

396
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:59,120
Yeah, listen, Gordon's running
pretty hot on this one, Cap.

397
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,880
Can you blame him? He thinks
Thompkins is the next victim.

398
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:06,680
<i>- Still, watch him.</i>
- Alvarez called.

399
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:10,120
Nothing on the son on the system.
We have to make him talk.

400
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,000
Make this simple.

401
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,160
Give us your son's name
and address.

402
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,800
Or what?
I am not afraid of you.

403
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,800
Only because you don't know me.

404
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,920
Listen, I get wanting
to protect your son,

405
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,640
but how many more women
is he gonna have to kill

406
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,000
before you realize
he needs to be locked up?

407
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,920
- What are you talking about?
- Don't play dumb with me.

408
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,600
You are hiding a rotting corpse
upstairs for years,

409
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,640
but "No, no, my son's an angel."

410
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,480
He didn't murder close
to a dozen women

411
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,600
that we know of.

412
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,600
My son, he made one mistake.

413
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:48,080
One.
Anything else is lies.

414
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,080
So tell us the truth.

415
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,040
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

416
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,600
Selina, what happened last night,

417
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,680
that can never happen again.

418
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,240
I told you,
I didn't have a choice.

419
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,400
I don't accept that.

420
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,240
I knew you wouldn't be able
to handle it.

421
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,320
You're right.

422
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,360
- I did want to kill him.
- Keep your voice down.

423
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,600
But there's a line, Selina.

424
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,280
And you could say,
I don't have guts

425
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,840
but the fact is
I will never cross it.

426
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,360
I guess that's
where we're different then.

427
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,560
Because if I had to do it again,
I would.

428
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:31,560
And it wouldn't bother me one bit.

429
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,720
That's Bunderslaw.

430
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,680
- Riddle Man.
- Officer Dougherty, a word.

431
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,840
I can start a war or end one.

432
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,600
I can give you
the strength of heroes

433
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,120
or leave you powerless.

434
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,480
I might be snared with a glance,

435
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,440
but no force can compel me
to stay.

436
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,480
What am I?

437
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,000
- You got me.
- Love.

438
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,680
Miss Kringle has given hers
to you.

439
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,480
And in return, you hurt her.

440
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,360
- I saw the bruises.
- And?

441
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,760
And you cannot do that.

442
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,920
The next time you do that, I'll...

443
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,200
Calm down.
You give yourself a girly fit.

444
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,880
Have you ever been with a woman?

445
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,440
Didn't think so.

446
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,440
They need a firm hand.

447
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,560
And that goes double for Kringle.
Girl's got a tongue.

448
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,200
I won't let you hurt her.

449
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,720
Oh, yeah?

450
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,080
What are you gonna do?

451
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,680
That's what I thought.

452
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,880
Later, Riddle Man.

453
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,720
Care to dance?

454
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,800
- You.
- Me.

455
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,720
It was not a place
for a boy to grow up.

456
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,960
Miss van Groot kept herself
sealed off from the world,

457
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,040
but she doted on my son.

458
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,520
Treated him as her own.

459
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:47,080
Still, I, I didn't realize
how deep it went.

460
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,520
The kid's own mom
was out of the picture

461
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,440
so it seems he started thinking

462
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,760
he was this van Groot woman's
secret son.

463
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,440
I tried to tell him
it wasn't true,

464
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:57,120
but he had built this fantasy.

465
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,760
And Miss van Groot led him on.
She was deranged.

466
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,840
Cruel even.

467
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,000
It's about ten years ago,
he confronts her,

468
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,600
he demands
that she acknowledge him,

469
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:09,240
give him her last name,
put him in the will.

470
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,080
She laughs at him.

471
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:14,120
So it was all just a big joke.
So he kills her.

472
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,680
His dad feels guilty,
helps him cover it up.

473
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,760
So the old woman rejects him,
he kills her, bang.

474
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,280
You got a serial killer with
the mommy-didn't-love-me complex.

475
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,520
But there's a wrinkle.

476
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,520
Look,
I don't know where my son is.

477
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,400
He called today, told me
the police would be coming.

478
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,280
But I haven't seen him

479
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,560
since the day
he killed Miss van Groot.

480
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:38,280
My son is not a bad man.

481
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,760
Your son has been seducing
and killing women

482
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,160
for almost a decade.

483
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,920
Why is he laughing?

484
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,120
My son?
Seducing women?

485
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:58,040
Let me show you my son.
Two pictures.

486
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,240
That's all I managed to save.

487
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,720
You've heard,
"a face only a mother could love?"

488
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,840
Well, his mother couldn't.

489
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,760
She left us after he was born.

490
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:12,480
Oh, yes, my son, the seducer.

491
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,440
Now, you can see
why it makes sense

492
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,440
he scratched his face
out of those pictures.

493
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,880
But that means
this can't be the Ogre.

494
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,440
We're chasing the wrong guy.

495
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,840
Jim had an idea.

496
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,240
Judge Harkness's warrant
was very specific.

497
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,880
- I don't have to say anything.
- Then nod.

498
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,440
Did you operate on this man?

499
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,520
I need to know
what he looks like now.

500
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,360
Or the next woman he kills
will be on your head.

501
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:00,120
And never, never would he play
with the other children.

502
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:04,840
He knew even then
he was too good for them.

503
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:09,240
And now he is a respectable man
of business,

504
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,920
my Oswald.

505
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,560
Well, this has been a delight.

506
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,520
But it's late.

507
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,880
One thing, Gertrude, my love.

508
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,160
A question
that's been bothering me.

509
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:26,000
Oh, no. Oh, no.

510
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,400
Is this an act?

511
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,160
Are you pretending
that he's just a nightclub owner?

512
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,760
- Or are you really that stupid?
- Stop!

513
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,440
I don't understand. I...

514
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,880
- Your son...
- Don Maroni, I am warning you!

515
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,600
- Is a coldblooded psychopath.
- No, no, no.

516
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,000
I can't count
how many men he's killed.

517
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:52,320
My own friend, Frankie Carbone,
he stabbed him a dozen times.

518
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,320
What kind of person
plunges a knife into someone

519
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,760
over and over?

520
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,720
He's a filthy liar, Mother!

521
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,480
He's just angry
because I played him for a fool.

522
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,120
You know, don't you?
Oh, I can see it.

523
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,560
Let go of her!

524
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:10,520
Did you catch him one night,
washing the blood from his hands?

525
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,600
When did you realize

526
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,840
that you had given birth
to a monster?

527
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:26,240
- You're going to pay for this!
- Maybe.

528
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,160
Or maybe this ends with me

529
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,160
dumping your lifeless body
into the river.

530
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,480
Either way, you and Momma Gertrud
can stop pretending.

531
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,720
The place is looking good.

532
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,640
The other night,
when you saw my invitation,

533
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,480
why didn't you tell me
you were going?

534
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:55,400
I wasn't.
I didn't get invited.

535
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:58,200
Oh, so you're crashing.

536
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:01,160
Oh, no, I'm on the list.

537
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,400
It's amazing, what a
10,000 dollar donation will do.

538
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,800
You donated 10,000 dollars
to this?

539
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,640
- Why?
- I was hoping

540
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,480
that would be apparent.

541
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,080
And what if I decided
not to come?

542
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:21,080
Well, I'd have been making
a generous donation to charity

543
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:25,080
and I would have been
very disappointed.

544
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,680
The way things ended last night,

545
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,760
it was my fault.

546
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,880
But I felt something.

547
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,640
I couldn't let it slip away.

548
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,120
Well, that's very sweet, but...

549
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,560
You said that when people see
the real you, they run screaming.

550
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,640
Someone said,
the same thing to me once,

551
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,760
that no one would ever love me.

552
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,320
Who?

553
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,600
The woman I thought
was my mother.

554
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:24,960
Barbara, I know what it's like
to be one person on the inside

555
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,600
and have the world see another.

556
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,520
I lived like that.

557
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:33,360
And it almost destroyed me.
I can see it destroying you.

558
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,520
- I don't wanna dance anymore.
- The person that I am now,

559
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,520
I created it.

560
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,160
I brought him into being.

561
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,840
I can do the same for you.

562
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:52,040
Aren't you tired of playing games?

563
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,200
Of hiding?

564
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,680
Yes.

565
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,240
- Goodbye.
- See you soon.

566
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,960
- Hello, I'm Bruce Wayne.
- Sid Bunderslaw.

567
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,200
I'm going around
to try to get to know everybody

568
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,880
who works for the company.

569
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,960
You do work for Wayne Enterprises,
don't you?

570
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:25,000
I do. I'm the Director
of Physical Operations

571
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,600
which I'm afraid is a bit dull.

572
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,600
There are many much more
interesting people here.

573
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:33,920
Yes, well, I'm sure I'll get
to meet everyone eventually.

574
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,440
If you will forgive me, Bruce,
I have an early flight tomorrow.

575
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,920
It's been a pleasure.

576
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,320
It was...

577
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,440
It was nice meeting you.

578
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,080
Sorry.

579
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,720
See?

580
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,240
Nothing to it.

581
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,840
What is it?

582
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,400
Nothing.

583
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,920
Stop right there, buster.

584
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,320
Riddle Man?

585
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,320
What the hell are you doing
creeping around here?

586
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,240
You need to leave
Miss Kringle alone.

587
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,800
What?

588
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:37,560
I'm not gonna let you hurt her.
Ever again.

589
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,320
I think you need to leave Gotham.

590
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,480
Tonight.

591
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,160
I get it now.

592
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,720
You got a thing for my girl.

593
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,040
This is too funny.

594
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,960
Don't take this personal.

595
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,600
You want some more?

596
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,120
Upsy-daisy.

597
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,000
Oh, dear.

598
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,920
Riddle Man.

599
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,760
Oh, dear.

600
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,400
Oh, dear.
Oh, no.

601
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,400
Oh, dear.

602
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:53,960
Oh, dear.

603
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,240
Oh, dear.

604
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,600
- Oswald.
- Feeling better?

605
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,840
I made tea.

606
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:16,600
I'm afraid you had,
well, a little too much to drink.

607
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:19,840
Mr. Maroni, he, he has a strange
sense of humor

608
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,480
Oswald.

609
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:24,560
I am not some bumpkin
from the country

610
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,880
with hay in my brains.

611
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,680
- No.
- I am your mother.

612
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:33,160
And I will love you
no matter what.

613
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,880
But lie to me now...

614
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,440
And you will break my heart.

615
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,040
Oswald.

616
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,440
Have you done things...

617
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,120
You should not?

618
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,040
Mother.

619
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,800
I'm a nightclub owner.

620
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,760
That's all.

621
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,000
You're a liar now.

622
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,400
I am tired.

623
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,280
Yeah, I got a delivery
for Gertrude from Sal.

624
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,520
Tip's not included.

625
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,560
You tell Sal it's over.
The guns are bought.

626
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:54,040
The killing room is waiting.

627
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:57,120
He doesn't know it,
but he's a dead man.

628
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:09,000
On second thought,
I'll tell him myself.

629
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:21,480
<i>Oswald?
Who was that?</i>

630
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:24,000
It's Mr. Yatsko from next door.

631
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,160
He needs help
taking out some trash.

632
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,200
<i>You, please, you help him then.</i>

633
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,240
Jason Van Groot?

634
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,240
His real name is Jason Skolimski.

635
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,080
He used the old woman's name
when he went to the clinic.

636
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,720
But there's no Jason Van Groot
or Skolimski in Gotham.

637
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,760
- The guy's a ghost.
- So the old woman rejects him,

638
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:51,240
he goes to the doctor,
gets himself a pretty new face.

639
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,080
That's where he runs
into the nurse.

640
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,800
And we're off to the races.

641
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,200
I don't suppose
you got a picture?

642
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,880
Missing from the file.
No, surprise there.

643
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,120
But the good doctor
was kind enough to do a sketch.

644
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,720
It's been ten years
since he last saw him,

645
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,800
but at least it's a start.

646
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,760
So we have his real name,
but not what alias he's using

647
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:11,160
or what he looks like
beyond a decade-old sketch.

648
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,400
Did he say anything else
on the phone today?

649
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,600
Anything we might have missed?

650
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,600
No, just wanted me to back off.

651
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,480
Told me not to believe
my own press

652
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,000
as the rising star
of the G.C.P.D.

653
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,920
What is it?

654
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,080
The paper that said that,

655
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,320
they ran an old photo of me
from a charity gala.

656
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,200
I wasn't alone.

657
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,240
Barbara?

658
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,480
- Is Barbara here?
- No, why?

659
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,320
Where is she?
When's the last time you saw her?

660
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,320
At the Wayne Ball.
She left with some guy.

661
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,280
Is this the guy?

662
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,760
That's kind of a crappy drawing.

663
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,280
Was this the guy?

664
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,600
Yeah, I think so.

665
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,640
Why? Who is he?

666
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,720
What's through there?

667
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,040
See for yourself.
