[Tokyo] After the heist
at the Royal Mint of Spain,

69
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:40,875
the Professor spent his days haunted
by the guilt of his brother's death.

70
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,916
He felt like he'd pushed Berlin away
from the Bank of Spain heist

71
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,750
so he could pull his own job.

And now he was dead.

00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,708
It'll become insolvent
and therefore bankrupt.

159
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:11,625
[Professor] Exactly.

160
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:14,375
It'll be like a domino effect,

161
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:18,791
which will generate colossal pressure
on the government.

162
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,541
And then we will be the only ones

163
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,958
able to stop all of that
with a single gesture…

164
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:32,041
giving back the gold.

165
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,208
Uh, what?

166
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:38,375
Uh, just making sure I got this all right.

167
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:42,416
Are you telling me that my life depends
on placing a fucking bet, Professor?

168
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,750
On the market tumbling or not tumbling?
What if it doesn't?

169
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:47,708
It always happens this way, Denver.
Like it did in Greece.

170
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:52,291
It's the very nature of the system.
It's designed to do that automatically.

171
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:54,416
And it's predictable.

172
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,500
You know what's predictable?
Going through a tunnel.

173
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,958
Because you get in one side
and you get out the other.

174
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:01,250
That's predictable.
But this is beyond our control.

175
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:03,416
-Denver, stop--
-No, don't "Denver, stop" me.

176
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,208
He can't play with our lives like that.
Let me tell you something.

177
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,041
It's not gonna work, okay?

178
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,708
[Tamayo] You came in here
to make sure no one would talk

179
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:13,750
so that you could keep blackmailing me.

180
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,541
Great, now that we all know

181
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:20,125
that this economic scheme
is nothing but a fucking hoax,

182
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:21,416
do you know what I'm gonna do?

183
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:26,125
I'm going to question all of you
one by one.

184
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:29,750
And whoever doesn't tell me anything,

185
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:32,125
they're gonna go out
through that fucking door,

186
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:34,416
directly to a new life in a prison cell.

187
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:36,041
Barefaced,

188
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:40,125
with all those TV cameras on you,
so that there's no going back.

189
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:41,833
Each one you take out,

190
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:43,375
each person, I swear to you,

191
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:46,208
equals ten tons of gold
you'll never recover.

192
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,375
[whispering] Son of a bitch.

193
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:55,375
I told you that was a game
you couldn't play.

194
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:57,958
-Denver, shut up. The game is on.
-[Denver] "Shut up"?

195
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:59,708
-Denver.
-What?

196
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:00,791
Shut up.

197
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:03,125
Shut up? Shut up?

198
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:05,541
We're all here right now,
all on our knees,

199
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:08,625
with a fucking rifle against our necks!

200
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:10,625
-Because we listened to this psycho!
-Shut up!

201
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:12,541
-I won't shut up!
-Denver, shut the fuck up!

Take those two and separate them
from the rest of the gang.

205
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,250
Denver, you're going to be the first one.

206
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,333
Denver. Remember what I said!

207
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:35,375
Someone stole the gold.
If anyone finds out, it's over.

208
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:39,000
I swear on our son
that I'll get you out of here.

209
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:40,708
Denver, don't do anything.

210
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:42,958
Denver, listen to me.

211
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:46,083
Denver, remember what I told you!

212
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,875
[Tokyo] And while the gang
was up against the ropes…

213
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:56,541
This pump is used
to suck aggregate from the sea bottom.

214
00:12:57,125 --> 00:13:00,208
With this much driving force,
they could send all the gold upstream.

215
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:03,291
[Tokyo] …Ángel thought he'd finally found
the right thread to pull.

216
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:05,958
We've been looking
in the wrong direction the entire time.

217
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:08,291
[Tokyo] But that was just part
of Plan Tom Thumb.

218
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:11,583
I need eight men at the door,
immediately, now. We're leaving.

219
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:16,541
[Alicia] Where the fuck do you hide
90 tons of gold, Benjamín?

220
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,250
In a… In a forest.

221
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:22,125
Or in the desert.
Or an abandoned place no one knows about.

222
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:26,125
We need to think like them,
like an engineer, a graduate of MIT.

223
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,208
Minimize the risks.

224
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:33,208
And to minimize the risks,
you have to make sure that no moron

225
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:36,583
will come around looking for coins
with a metal detector someday.

226
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:38,291
And there's only one way to do that,

227
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:39,625
limiting the access…

228
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,708
A private property.

229
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:43,291
Exactly.

230
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:47,041
A private property, which by the way needs
to be close enough to the stormwater tank.

231
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:50,208
These people knew the plan perfectly,

232
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:51,791
but with Berlin dead,

233
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:55,208
they didn't even imagine
the heist would ever take place, though.

234
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:58,041
Holy shit!

235
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:01,458
They started to act
the moment the heist began.

236
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:04,458
We have to look for any land
that was bought in the last five days.

237
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:06,916
All roads will lead to the same place.

238

The land property records.

239
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:12,333
Then we need to go in fully armed.

This could be your new identity, Denver.

243
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:24,541
And there's more.

244
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:29,333
Three million euros for a new start,
financial freedom.

245
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:32,916
You could buy a house with a jacuzzi,
throw some nice little parties…

246
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,833
In the country of your choosing.

247
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,708
And also a lifetime allowance
of 25,000 euros a month

248
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:41,000
at the expense of the Government of Spain.

249
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:45,666
A premium pension. [snickering]

250

What do you think?

251
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:52,958
And, uh, what happens to my family?

[sighs] We can make an exception.
Two for one.

253
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:01,416
If you tell me where the gold is,

254
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,166
Stockholm, you, and your kid,
who's hiding out there somewhere,

255
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,375
will be able to start from zero.

256
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:09,416
Okay, but I don't know
where to find the gold.

257
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:15,500
It's the truth. I don't know.

258
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:18,750
Look, Denver, you know something,
and I need an informer

259
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:20,583
who can give me
all the details of the plan.

260
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:23,666
I'll find the gold later,
but you'll get your freedom anyway.

261
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:27,416
I know it's fucking tough,

262
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,333
but you don't even have to
say it out loud if you don't want to.

263
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:34,541
All you have to do

264
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:36,708
is write down what it is

265

doesn't want you to say.

Then, the fridge started to beep.

313
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:41,583
Did you find out like that as well?

314
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:43,208
No.

315
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:45,708
[Berlin] Well, sure you did, Sergio.
You were there.

316
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:47,166
You'd just been discharged.

317
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:50,333
In fact, it was one of the few times
you weren't in the hospital.

318
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,583
I was there, but I already knew.

319
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:57,083
What?

320
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:00,125
A noise woke me up that morning.

321
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:01,041
[thud]

322
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:03,541
[Professor] I jumped out of bed,
in my pajamas.

323
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:07,166
I went to the window, the one that was
facing the courtyard, and I saw Papa.

324
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:11,208
He was loading the trunk.
I thought, "It's the fishing gear."

325
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:15,375
Remember he promised,
when I got out of the hospital,

326
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:16,375
that we'd go fishing?

327
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:21,875
So I got dressed and chased after him.

328
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:24,625
-I ran down the stairs.
-[engine turns over]

329
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:25,625
[young Professor] Papa!

330
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,250
[Professor] I missed him by three seconds.

331
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,291
By three seconds!

332
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:40,125
So then I grabbed your bicycle.

333
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:49,375
And I began pedaling as fast as I could.

334
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:50,416
Papa!

335
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:53,375
[Professor] I saw the car in the distance.
I was getting closer.

336
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:57,041
He stopped at a traffic light,
but as I was about to reach him,

337
00:21:58,166 --> 00:21:59,333
the light turned green.

338
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:03,500
Papa!

339
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:04,625
He kept escaping me.

340
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:14,541
And I saw him in the distance.

341
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:17,500
He was changing cars.

342
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,041
And after five, six minutes…

343
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,083
I saw the car parked without him in it.

344
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:34,166
And then…

345
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:36,208
[gunfire]

346
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:38,083
…I heard two gunshots.

347
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:41,875
I was scared to death.

348
00:22:44,416 --> 00:22:47,416
And then I saw Papa
coming out of the bank.

349
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:49,083
-Don't move!
-Freeze!

350
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:51,083
On the ground, now!

351
00:22:51,583 --> 00:22:52,875
[Professor] And he saw me.

352
00:23:02,666 --> 00:23:05,125
Then they started yelling at him,
"On your knees!"

353
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:07,333
-On your knees!
-[Professor] "On your knees."

354
00:23:07,416 --> 00:23:09,916
[officer] On your knees!
Get on the ground right now!

355
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,291
Right now! On the ground!

356
00:23:13,041 --> 00:23:14,541
He didn't do it, Andrés.

357
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,958
Because he was looking at me.

358
00:23:25,916 --> 00:23:26,833
And…

359
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:54,125
BANK OF SPAIN

360
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:04,583
[sniffling]

361
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:13,416
That's how I found out.

362
00:24:15,833 --> 00:24:17,208
[Rafael] And what did you do?

363
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:20,208
Nothing. I just… went home.

364
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:23,333
Sergio, I… I was there when you got home.

365
00:24:23,416 --> 00:24:24,291
Yeah.

366
00:24:24,958 --> 00:24:26,625
Why didn't you say anything?

367
00:24:28,625 --> 00:24:30,916
Well, because for me, it was like a movie.

368
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,250
Papa would always tell stories about…

369
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:35,791
about heists and all that
as if they were a movie.

370
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:36,708
[both chuckle]

371
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,333
[Professor] And, uh,

372
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:41,708
while I was pedaling
on the way home, I thought…

373
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:44,750
"This is just a movie."

374
00:24:45,916 --> 00:24:47,416
"And if I don't say anything,

375
00:24:49,041 --> 00:24:50,000
it'll always be."

376
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,416
And it worked. It worked,

377
00:24:56,583 --> 00:24:58,041
until I heard the radio.

378
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,750
So when you ask me
why I choose to plan the heists,

379
00:25:03,833 --> 00:25:04,875
the answer is simple.

380
00:25:05,666 --> 00:25:06,833
To talk to him.

381
00:25:11,125 --> 00:25:14,791
The night before, he told me
about his dream to rob the Royal Mint.

382
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:18,208
And we both
laughed our asses off. [laughing]

383
00:25:18,291 --> 00:25:22,416
"Can you imagine
a machine that can make money?"

384
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,875
[all laughing]

385
00:25:27,083 --> 00:25:28,958
Now I'm the one who's narrating movies.

386
00:25:29,041 --> 00:25:31,875
I ask him, "Papa, what do you think?
How's this or that part of the plan?"

387
00:25:31,958 --> 00:25:34,625
Um… "Do you see any weak points?"

388
00:25:38,625 --> 00:25:39,833
We talk a lot.

389
00:25:47,916 --> 00:25:50,291
More often than I talk
to any other living person.

390
00:25:53,416 --> 00:25:55,916
[police radio chatter and chirping]

391
00:25:59,416 --> 00:26:01,416
[K-9 barking]

392
00:26:07,041 --> 00:26:09,500
[phone buzzing]

393
00:26:11,666 --> 00:26:14,208
-Tell me.
-[Ángel] We found the Professor's base.

394
00:26:14,291 --> 00:26:17,708
No sign of the gold.
They burned everything before escaping.

395
00:26:17,791 --> 00:26:19,708
Fuck, Ángel.
Can you give me some good news?

396
00:26:19,791 --> 00:26:22,166
Looks like they melted the gold
back into ingots

397
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:24,416
maybe so it's easier to carry.

398
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,666
And Colonel, we can
probably trace those trucks.

399
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,000
Go talk to Interpol.

400
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:30,666
We need to issue an international warrant

401
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,541
and get all those
European satellites looking.

402
00:26:33,375 --> 00:26:35,000
We're going to find them, Ángel.

403
00:26:35,083 --> 00:26:35,916
Okay.

404
00:26:36,333 --> 00:26:39,291
PASAIA PORT, 3:07 A.M.

405
00:26:39,791 --> 00:26:43,916
[Tokyo] Those trucks were the breadcrumbs
Marseille was leaving on his path.

406
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,458
Traces on a road that wasn't taken.
Of a loot that wasn't there

407
00:26:47,541 --> 00:26:50,208
whose only purpose
was to drive the police crazy.

408
00:27:17,291 --> 00:27:18,166
And so?

409
00:27:25,291 --> 00:27:27,625
We don't have the backing
of the Bank of Central Europe.

410
00:27:29,541 --> 00:27:31,250
They're very skeptical…

411
00:27:33,416 --> 00:27:35,333
about how to manage the crisis.

412
00:27:37,041 --> 00:27:39,083
And what does… does that mean?

413
00:27:39,166 --> 00:27:40,000
[governor] Minister?

414
00:27:44,958 --> 00:27:46,666
They'll let us fall apart.

415
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:50,708
[governor] The stock market
plummeting 14% today in three hours

416
00:27:51,291 --> 00:27:52,500
will be a joke

417
00:27:53,375 --> 00:27:55,875
compared to what will happen
at nine in the morning

418
00:27:56,958 --> 00:27:58,375
when the markets open.

419
00:27:58,458 --> 00:27:59,291
[loud bang]

420
00:27:59,875 --> 00:28:02,000
You've got the mastermind
of the operation in there,

421
00:28:02,083 --> 00:28:04,583
on his knees, beaten, and handcuffed.

422
00:28:04,666 --> 00:28:06,666
Tell me what the fuck
you're doing in here!

423
00:28:15,708 --> 00:28:17,125
[Tamayo] You, get out of here.

424
00:28:19,833 --> 00:28:20,750
[yells]

425
00:28:20,833 --> 00:28:21,916
You son of a bitch!

426
00:28:22,625 --> 00:28:23,541
-[grunts]
-[Lisbon] No!

427
00:28:24,458 --> 00:28:25,875
You know, you're wrong about me.

428
00:28:25,958 --> 00:28:29,291
Tamayo, if you cross that red line,
there's no turning back.

429
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:32,041
-[groans]
-You're saying that to me?

430
00:28:32,125 --> 00:28:33,458
Watch this.

431
00:28:34,041 --> 00:28:35,000
[Professor grunts]

432
00:28:38,125 --> 00:28:41,375
I need you to understand one thing,
or I'll smash that little head of yours.

433
00:28:41,458 --> 00:28:43,250
You won't have an autopsy.

434
00:28:43,333 --> 00:28:46,291
I'll tear you apart, punch after punch
in front of your girlfriend.

435
00:28:46,375 --> 00:28:50,291
And I won't stop until you tell me
where the gold is or until you die

436
00:28:50,375 --> 00:28:52,250
because either I win or no one does.

437
00:28:52,916 --> 00:28:54,583
-[Professor grunts]
-Stop!

438
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:56,333
[Tamayo panting]

439
00:29:00,416 --> 00:29:02,833
And what if you're wrong
about what it means to "win"?

440
00:29:04,458 --> 00:29:08,250
Picture yourself
a few months from now, at home,

441
00:29:08,833 --> 00:29:11,625
listening to the unemployment figures,
the debt maturities.

442
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,208
The whole country

443
00:29:14,041 --> 00:29:17,333
plunging into bankruptcy,
into an unprecedented crisis,

444
00:29:17,416 --> 00:29:19,000
into absolute chaos.

445
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,458
Which Tamayo would have won more?

446
00:29:23,291 --> 00:29:26,791
The one who arrested us?
The one who killed us and lost the gold?

447
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:31,541
Or the one who got it back and stopped
the biggest financial collapse in history?

448
00:29:35,541 --> 00:29:36,375
Listen to me.

449
00:29:38,208 --> 00:29:39,041
Tamayo…

450
00:29:40,083 --> 00:29:42,708
I know you'll struggle to grasp this.
I really do.

451
00:29:44,625 --> 00:29:47,166
But in this moment,
we both only have one option.

452
00:29:47,833 --> 00:29:48,666
Just one.

453
00:29:49,791 --> 00:29:51,166
Either we both win…

454
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,458
or we both lose.

455
00:29:55,625 --> 00:29:57,625
[tense music playing]

456
00:30:04,791 --> 00:30:05,708
[music ends suddenly]

457
00:30:05,791 --> 00:30:08,208
I don't know where the gold is.
I don't know.

458
00:30:09,916 --> 00:30:12,333
I don't. Lisbon doesn't.
No one in the gang does.

459
00:30:14,375 --> 00:30:15,583
What did you expect?

460
00:30:16,291 --> 00:30:18,083
You think I'd be here
with that information?

461
00:30:18,166 --> 00:30:19,291
I'd never do that.

462
00:30:19,375 --> 00:30:21,916
Tamayo, you bury people in the desert.

463
00:30:23,833 --> 00:30:26,916
Sooner or later, you would've
squeezed it out of one of us.

464
00:30:28,875 --> 00:30:32,500
I couldn't let anyone into the bank
with that information, not even myself.

465
00:30:36,458 --> 00:30:38,041
That's our firewall.

466
00:30:41,125 --> 00:30:42,666
The gold is already out.

467
00:30:47,708 --> 00:30:48,833
It's on the move.

468
00:30:50,083 --> 00:30:52,083
[snickering]

469
00:30:57,166 --> 00:31:00,708
So this is the grand finale,
the last abracadabra, huh?

470
00:31:02,083 --> 00:31:05,041
Ninety tons of gold somewhere out there…

471
00:31:07,125 --> 00:31:08,750
dancing gracefully.

472
00:31:10,958 --> 00:31:12,125
[smacks tongue]

473
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:17,208
But you are still right about one thing.

474
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:26,750
I don't really know how I can win.

475
00:31:36,416 --> 00:31:38,333
So maybe both of us have to lose.

476
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,791
Tamayo, you and I are insignificant

477
00:31:43,875 --> 00:31:45,916
compared to the impending
economic tsunami.

478
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,541
Absolutely insignificant.

479
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:51,041
Tamayo, you know there's only one way out.

480
00:31:51,125 --> 00:31:52,041
I know you do.

481
00:32:06,375 --> 00:32:09,541
LAND REGISTRY, 6:50 A.M.

482
00:32:13,541 --> 00:32:14,916
[suspenseful music playing]

483
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,458
[guns cocking]

484
00:32:20,541 --> 00:32:21,375
Buenos días.

485
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:23,958
[Alicia] The auction has begun.

486
00:32:24,041 --> 00:32:24,875
BACK IN 2 HOURS

487
00:32:24,958 --> 00:32:27,833
[Alicia] Who's been working here
for longer than 15 years?

488
00:32:28,708 --> 00:32:29,791
Longer than 20?

489
00:32:30,708 --> 00:32:32,000
Twenty-two?

490
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:33,750
[shuddered breathing]

491
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
And sold.

492
00:32:43,583 --> 00:32:44,625
Would you come with me?

493
00:32:45,125 --> 00:32:46,416
Today you'll be able to enjoy

494
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,708
the kind of thing
you've been hearing all over the news,

495
00:32:48,791 --> 00:32:50,333
cooperation with an armed group.

496
00:32:50,416 --> 00:32:53,000
You won't be charged though
because we're forcing you.

497
00:32:53,083 --> 00:32:54,166
Thrilling, huh?

498
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:55,125
Oh. Yeah.

499
00:32:56,208 --> 00:32:59,625
[Tokyo] Everyone was after the gold,
like a scavenger hunt.

500
00:32:59,708 --> 00:33:03,250
Sierra knew that the gold was
the only way she could avoid jail.

501
00:33:04,416 --> 00:33:05,250
It's here.

502
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:06,958
[Tokyo] And Ángel was scrambling.

503
00:33:07,041 --> 00:33:10,750
He took the bait so hard
the fishhook was almost in his stomach.

504
00:33:10,833 --> 00:33:11,833
[sighs]

505
00:33:11,916 --> 00:33:12,875
[Tamayo] Tell me!

506
00:33:12,958 --> 00:33:16,208
Colonel, we've tracked down the trucks.
They're heading north, on Route 1.

507
00:33:16,291 --> 00:33:17,708
They're at the Pasaia port.

508
00:33:17,791 --> 00:33:19,958
The fucking Professor
won't say a word, Ángel.

509
00:33:20,041 --> 00:33:21,416
Get your ass there right now.

510
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,625
[Ángel] I'm getting on a helicopter.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

511
00:33:32,208 --> 00:33:33,166
[Lisbon] Sergio.

512
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:36,750
Sergio.

513
00:33:38,375 --> 00:33:39,291
Does it hurt?

514
00:33:39,375 --> 00:33:40,291
What?

515
00:33:41,291 --> 00:33:44,583
-Does it hurt? You're bleeding.
-Oh, no, no, no. I'm fine. I'm fine.

516
00:33:45,083 --> 00:33:47,000
I'm… I'm really good. Really good.

517
00:33:47,083 --> 00:33:48,708
I took a couple of punches, but…

518
00:33:50,083 --> 00:33:51,500
you should see the other guy.

519
00:33:51,583 --> 00:33:52,958
[Lisbon chuckles]

520
00:33:53,041 --> 00:33:55,125
If he stayed here
for two more minutes, I mean--

521
00:33:55,208 --> 00:33:57,083
-You'd kick his ass.
-I'd kick his ass.

522
00:33:57,166 --> 00:33:58,291
[both laughing]

523
00:33:58,375 --> 00:34:00,208
[laughter bleeding out of headphones]

524
00:34:00,291 --> 00:34:01,708
I have no doubt.

525
00:34:06,666 --> 00:34:08,000
I'm glad to hear that.

526
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:13,333
If I'm not wrong, the last time we talked,
you called me a coward or something.

527
00:34:16,208 --> 00:34:18,041
You yelled at me to shut up.

528
00:34:18,666 --> 00:34:19,625
Yeah, I did.

529
00:34:20,916 --> 00:34:22,500
We argue a lot during heists.

530
00:34:22,583 --> 00:34:24,125
Mm. Mm-hmm.

531
00:34:24,916 --> 00:34:26,333
Maybe we should give it up.

532
00:34:29,041 --> 00:34:31,875
Mm-mm. It's not like canceling
your library membership. No, no, no.

533
00:34:31,958 --> 00:34:34,458
You need money.

534
00:34:35,291 --> 00:34:37,916
Not to be on the most wanted list
in 130 countries…

535
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,458
Oh, and a new identity.

536
00:34:40,666 --> 00:34:42,291
And right now, my face

537
00:34:42,916 --> 00:34:45,416
is in no condition for a passport picture.

538
00:34:48,291 --> 00:34:50,500
More importantly, you don't want to stop.

539
00:34:53,625 --> 00:34:54,708
Let me ask you…

540
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,958
After the Royal Mint of Spain heist,

541
00:34:58,041 --> 00:35:00,791
how long did it take you
to start thinking of this one?

542
00:35:00,875 --> 00:35:02,291
[Professor sighs]

543
00:35:04,958 --> 00:35:05,791
Hm.

544
00:35:07,916 --> 00:35:09,000
Forty-eight hours.

545
00:35:12,833 --> 00:35:14,166
Maybe 24.

546
00:35:18,291 --> 00:35:19,708
I owed it to my brother.

547
00:35:21,291 --> 00:35:22,833
Sure, sure, of course, yeah.

548
00:35:22,916 --> 00:35:24,791
Your tribute to dead relatives.

549
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:28,750
Some people throw ashes into the sea,

550
00:35:29,416 --> 00:35:31,833
others bring flowers to the cemetery…

551
00:35:33,791 --> 00:35:35,791
You rob the national reserve.

552
00:35:37,208 --> 00:35:38,291
But you know what?

553
00:35:39,083 --> 00:35:40,916
You don't do it for your father

554
00:35:42,666 --> 00:35:43,750
or for your brother.

555
00:35:45,958 --> 00:35:47,291
You do it for you.

556
00:35:58,958 --> 00:36:02,458
Um, no, it's my way
of communicating with them.

557
00:36:04,333 --> 00:36:05,625
I mean, how? A Ouija board?

558
00:36:06,291 --> 00:36:07,625
[Lisbon scoffs] No.

559
00:36:10,416 --> 00:36:12,083
That's just what you tell yourself.

560
00:36:12,666 --> 00:36:15,291
It's easier to say
than to take off your mask.

561
00:36:16,833 --> 00:36:18,833
Because I know you love masks.

562
00:36:22,791 --> 00:36:24,458
You're always…

563
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,333
playing the role of the nerd,

564
00:36:28,125 --> 00:36:31,541
with your glasses, origami…

565
00:36:32,583 --> 00:36:33,875
And in reality…

566
00:36:34,958 --> 00:36:36,500
In reality, you…

567
00:36:37,208 --> 00:36:39,416
walked into the bank with the confidence

568
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:42,666
of someone that's about to
arm-wrestle the government.

569
00:36:45,791 --> 00:36:49,291
You are the magic trick, Sergio.

570
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:53,125
Dressed like Clark Kent.

571
00:36:56,041 --> 00:36:58,208
But it's about time you take it off

572
00:36:59,666 --> 00:37:01,583
and accept who you really are.

573
00:37:01,666 --> 00:37:03,000
Will you marry me?

574
00:37:05,541 --> 00:37:06,541
[scoffs]

575
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,041
Was it a better proposal this time?

576
00:37:09,125 --> 00:37:10,625
-Fuck. I did it again, I…
-No--

577
00:37:10,708 --> 00:37:12,458
I suddenly spit it out
like at the motor home.

578
00:37:12,541 --> 00:37:14,791
-I just… I can't believe it…
-[chuckling] No. No.

579
00:37:14,875 --> 00:37:16,250
It was good. Yeah.

580
00:37:22,083 --> 00:37:22,916
And?

581
00:37:26,125 --> 00:37:26,958
I will.

582
00:37:27,583 --> 00:37:28,500
I'll do it.

583
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,208
Let's win this.

584
00:37:56,583 --> 00:37:59,500
No matter how tough things get,
they still love each other.

585
00:38:03,416 --> 00:38:07,583
A total of 612 purchases
have gone through in the last five days.

586
00:38:08,083 --> 00:38:12,541
Mr. Anselmo Bueno Gutiérrez…
He sold an urban plot--

587
00:38:12,625 --> 00:38:15,291
Wait, hold on a sec. Let's keep it short.

588
00:38:16,208 --> 00:38:19,083
Give me just the ones bought in cash,
no mortgage.

589
00:38:19,166 --> 00:38:21,125
That does narrow down my search.

590
00:38:21,208 --> 00:38:22,791
But would you please…

591
00:38:22,875 --> 00:38:25,291
would you please
stop pointing a gun at me?

592
00:38:25,375 --> 00:38:27,583
-Benjamín…
-Oops, sorry.

593
00:38:30,625 --> 00:38:36,083
Here, Doña María Flores González
purchased a lot in Robledo de Chavela.

594
00:38:36,166 --> 00:38:40,958
The seller is Rosario Pineda Hernández,
the lot comprising an area of 3,189…

595
00:38:41,041 --> 00:38:45,416
[Tokyo] While Alicia Sierra realized she
was running out of time to find the gold,

596
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:48,041
the police were about to have an epiphany.

597
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:49,625
PLAN TOM THUMB

598
00:38:49,708 --> 00:38:53,625
Our man in the shadows
will scatter breadcrumbs along his path.

599
00:38:53,708 --> 00:38:58,041
Marseille, go to the stormwater tank.
When you get there, launch Plan Tom Thumb.

600
00:38:59,541 --> 00:39:02,125
[Tokyo] At 23:07 on the previous night,

601
00:39:02,208 --> 00:39:05,000
they prepared a crime scene
worthy of an Oscar.

602
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,750
The red trucks then
transported their fake loot.

603
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,916
And at 8:10 in the morning,

604
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,750
Ángel thought he found
something extraordinary.

605
00:39:14,833 --> 00:39:17,166
Colonel, I've got some footage
of a group of guys

606
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:19,250
loading pallets from trucks
onto a fishing boat.

607
00:39:19,333 --> 00:39:21,833
-What? A fishing boat?
-[Professor] Breadcrumbs in the sea.

608
00:39:21,916 --> 00:39:24,291
In order to follow them,
they'll need satellites,

609
00:39:24,375 --> 00:39:26,833
so they'll reach out
to NATO for help, to Interpol.

610
00:39:26,916 --> 00:39:29,875
They'll scan all the traffic cameras
in Spain. And all that…

611
00:39:31,666 --> 00:39:32,708
will make them confident.

612
00:39:32,791 --> 00:39:34,250
Could you zoom in?

613
00:39:34,333 --> 00:39:36,291
Zoom in here, on the main screen.

614
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:37,958
Bastards.

615
00:39:38,041 --> 00:39:41,500
-They're loading the gold onto a boat.
-[printer whirring]

616
00:39:41,583 --> 00:39:43,833
Because the harder it is
to follow something

617
00:39:43,916 --> 00:39:45,625
and the more it takes to reach it,

618
00:39:45,708 --> 00:39:49,333
the more you believe
that what you're going after is real.

619
00:39:52,458 --> 00:39:54,458
[tense music playing]

620
00:39:59,458 --> 00:40:01,500
[Tokyo] That's why Tamayo didn't hesitate.

621
00:40:01,583 --> 00:40:05,083
The cornerstone of the investigation
was the Virgen del Carmen IV,

622
00:40:05,875 --> 00:40:09,208
a vessel used for anchovy fishing
in the Cantabrian Sea.

623
00:40:10,583 --> 00:40:12,791
Ángel, where the fuck did that boat go?

624
00:40:12,875 --> 00:40:15,666
I don't know, Colonel.
We lost their GPS signal.

625
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:18,833
[Professor] Once they have
absolutely no idea where we're going,

626
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:21,333
they'll discover another turn of events.

627
00:40:22,875 --> 00:40:24,416
A random kidnapping at sea.

628
00:40:25,666 --> 00:40:28,833
Colonel, the boat showed up in Cantabria,
100 miles away.

629
00:40:28,916 --> 00:40:31,208
The captain and the crew
were tied up in the cabins.

630
00:40:31,291 --> 00:40:32,833
I'm on my way there on the helicopter.

631
00:40:32,916 --> 00:40:35,041
What? What do you mean, "tied up"?

632
00:40:35,125 --> 00:40:38,000
Because we have to make sure
lots of things are happening

633
00:40:38,083 --> 00:40:40,208
so that they won't have any time to think.

634
00:40:42,166 --> 00:40:43,750
Okay, then, tell me what happened.

635
00:40:43,833 --> 00:40:47,541
Well, uh, we were out there sailing
for about three or four hours.

636
00:40:47,625 --> 00:40:50,708
After that, we heard
some noises on the, uh, on the deck.

637
00:40:51,208 --> 00:40:52,958
As if someone was working.

638
00:40:53,041 --> 00:40:53,875
What kind of noises?

639
00:40:53,958 --> 00:40:55,541
The fishing crane.

640
00:40:55,625 --> 00:40:57,958
Like maybe the cargo was being emptied.

641
00:40:58,541 --> 00:40:59,666
Where did they empty it?

642
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:03,041
The ocean. They were throwing
something into the ocean.

643
00:41:04,291 --> 00:41:05,958
Oh, fuck off, Ángel. It makes no sense.

644
00:41:06,041 --> 00:41:08,375
Why wouldn't they just transfer
the cargo to another boat?

645
00:41:08,458 --> 00:41:11,958
-Why would they throw it into the sea?
-I don't know. They had some reason.

646
00:41:12,041 --> 00:41:13,625
And that question…

647
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,208
the most important one…

648
00:41:18,916 --> 00:41:20,625
will be answered by forensics.

649
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,250
They burned everything.

650
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:30,041
The few things we were able to restore
are pieces of nautical cartography.

651
00:41:31,458 --> 00:41:33,958
They show the Bay of Biscay,
and it's a very wide radius.

652
00:41:34,041 --> 00:41:36,583
-How wide?
-Thirty, forty miles.

653
00:41:37,666 --> 00:41:40,291
-But there's something else too.
-What's that?

654
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:41,916
It's a diagram for a depth buoy.

655
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,250
It shows a marking
at 70 meters below the water's surface.

656
00:41:47,125 --> 00:41:50,125
It could be a beacon for something
anchored to the sea bottom.

657
00:41:57,625 --> 00:41:58,500
[Professor] And then,

658
00:41:58,583 --> 00:42:01,375
once all that information
is spread out on the table,

659
00:42:01,458 --> 00:42:04,208
what had seemed crazy
will suddenly make sense.

660
00:42:05,625 --> 00:42:07,791
Because where is the only place

661
00:42:07,875 --> 00:42:10,958
you're able to leave
tons of gold for centuries

662
00:42:11,041 --> 00:42:12,583
without anyone finding it?

663
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:19,125
Where can you find
all the lost treasure of Spanish galleons?

664
00:42:19,625 --> 00:42:21,208
The bottom of the ocean.

665
00:42:23,416 --> 00:42:24,750
The bottom of the ocean.

666
00:42:25,333 --> 00:42:26,500
There's that fucking buoy.

667
00:42:27,416 --> 00:42:28,708
We need to mobilize the Navy.

668
00:42:28,791 --> 00:42:30,833
I want frigates,
battleships, aircraft carriers,

669
00:42:30,916 --> 00:42:32,791
every goddamn fucking thing!

670
00:42:33,291 --> 00:42:35,666
We're going to comb the Cantabrian Sea.

671
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:37,000
CANTABRIAN SEA, 11:54 A.M.

672
00:42:37,083 --> 00:42:38,500
[man] We're changing directions.

673
00:42:38,583 --> 00:42:41,291
New course, the Bay of Biscay.
Tracking service.

674
00:42:41,375 --> 00:42:45,791
[Tokyo] Tamayo was desperately trying
to hide that the gold had left the bank.

675
00:42:46,458 --> 00:42:50,625
He thought the best way to do this
was to pretend the war wasn't over.

676
00:42:50,708 --> 00:42:51,916
Fire at will!

677
00:42:59,833 --> 00:43:02,708
We can hear several gunshots
coming from inside the Bank of Spain.

678
00:43:02,791 --> 00:43:04,583
Apparently hostilities are continuing,

679
00:43:04,666 --> 00:43:06,833
although we still don't have
any more information.

680
00:43:09,458 --> 00:43:10,333
Gunshots?

681
00:43:14,708 --> 00:43:16,625
Yes, God damn it. Yes!

682
00:43:16,708 --> 00:43:18,458
-Hey, can you hear that?
-[officer] Shut up!

683
00:43:18,541 --> 00:43:20,583
-[Palermo] Know what that means?
-[officer] Get down!

684
00:43:20,666 --> 00:43:21,583
[gun cocks]

685
00:43:24,416 --> 00:43:26,083
It's just a fucking smoke screen.

686
00:43:27,041 --> 00:43:30,166
A smoke screen
or they just executed the Professor.

687
00:43:31,916 --> 00:43:33,416
We gotta be hopeful.

688
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:35,791
If the Professor's here,
then we'll be able to leave.

689
00:43:36,791 --> 00:43:38,916
Maybe you think too high of the Professor.

690
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,375
We have to think positive.

691
00:43:41,041 --> 00:43:43,875
Here we go,
the classic positivity of idiots.

692
00:43:43,958 --> 00:43:45,500
Take a look around you, Rio.

693
00:43:46,875 --> 00:43:48,583
How many clips do you guys have?

694
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:51,458
I mean, if you wanna think positive,

695
00:43:51,541 --> 00:43:54,833
I guess we can try to take them down
with some good old kung fu,

696
00:43:54,916 --> 00:43:57,500
then we escape and catch a train home.

697
00:43:59,291 --> 00:44:02,166
Positive thinking is
the downfall of civilization.

698
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:05,250
I could even kick your ass right now.
I'm that optimistic.

699
00:44:05,833 --> 00:44:07,125
And do you know why?

700
00:44:07,208 --> 00:44:09,333
Because I was
inside a fucking tomb in Algeria.

701
00:44:09,416 --> 00:44:13,125
And all I could think about
was getting out of there, and here I am.

702
00:44:13,208 --> 00:44:16,000
You are here
because I got involved in all this.

703
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:18,291
And this guy here.

704
00:44:19,333 --> 00:44:20,625
And that guy there.

705
00:44:21,208 --> 00:44:22,208
Understood?

706
00:44:22,291 --> 00:44:23,791
[Helsinki] Well, I'm with Rio.

707
00:44:24,291 --> 00:44:26,750
My whole life I've been in fucking wars.

708
00:44:27,541 --> 00:44:28,791
Now I want peace.

709
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:31,291
So I think about the future,

710
00:44:32,041 --> 00:44:33,125
a positive one.

711
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:35,833
I, uh…

712
00:44:36,833 --> 00:44:38,291
No one has ever loved me.

713
00:44:38,958 --> 00:44:41,208
I've never had a serious relationship.

714
00:44:42,375 --> 00:44:44,416
[sighs] I think it's finally my moment.

715
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:47,500
[Palermo] Are we in jail by any chance,
formally arrested,

716
00:44:47,583 --> 00:44:49,083
waiting to be judged?

717
00:44:50,125 --> 00:44:53,083
Or are we dead inside a plastic bag?
No, right?

718
00:44:54,291 --> 00:44:55,583
And why is that?

719
00:44:58,708 --> 00:45:00,375
What do you know that I don't?

720
00:45:04,125 --> 00:45:06,708
I'm just paying attention
to the signs, my friends.

721
00:45:07,541 --> 00:45:10,333
We've been detained for 24 hours
and we're still alive.

722
00:45:11,416 --> 00:45:12,500
Denver is out there.

723
00:45:13,166 --> 00:45:14,291
He's arrested.

724
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:16,625
That's the sign that I see.

725
00:45:19,041 --> 00:45:20,208
And it's irreversible.

726
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,166
This guy knows something.

727
00:45:26,333 --> 00:45:29,083
You should try a little
positive thinking, my friends.

728
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:32,333
[interference buzzing]

729
00:45:32,416 --> 00:45:34,250
[Tokyo] The last thing Tamayo needed

730
00:45:34,333 --> 00:45:37,625
was a video that showed the world
everything he was trying to hide.

731
00:45:37,708 --> 00:45:39,708
[Palermo] Ladies and gentlemen,
as promised,

732
00:45:39,791 --> 00:45:42,375
the answer to the question
"How did we get the gold out of here?"

733
00:45:42,458 --> 00:45:44,125
It was thanks to this baby.

734
00:45:44,625 --> 00:45:49,041
This extraction pump propelled the gold
over a distance of 18 kilometers,

735
00:45:49,125 --> 00:45:52,500
to a location where our team outside
collected the nuggets,

736
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:53,666
melted it down again,

737
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:55,250
and turned it into gold ingots.

738
00:45:55,333 --> 00:45:56,958
That's the blatant proof now

739
00:45:58,166 --> 00:45:59,916
that we don't have the gold.

740
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,916
…the gold has already left
the Bank of Spain.

741
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,791
In today's treasury auction,

742
00:46:04,875 --> 00:46:07,500
we're going to lose
billions and billions of euros,

743
00:46:09,125 --> 00:46:10,333
week after week,

744
00:46:10,416 --> 00:46:13,000
until we're unable to get any financing.

745
00:46:13,083 --> 00:46:17,125
And after that,
the country will go bankrupt.

746
00:46:18,166 --> 00:46:19,916
[minister] I said to stop the exchange.

747
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,875
I don't care if it's been open
for three minutes. Cut off the trading!

748
00:46:22,958 --> 00:46:24,375
The Professor was right.

749
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:27,458
This is a total shitstorm.

750
00:46:28,541 --> 00:46:31,291
[Tokyo] And just when everyone
thought the Spanish economy

751
00:46:31,375 --> 00:46:33,166
couldn't be more discredited…

752
00:46:33,666 --> 00:46:36,000
-Look at this!
-…came the cherry on top.

753
00:46:36,583 --> 00:46:38,583
You could argue that we were lying.

754
00:46:38,666 --> 00:46:41,875
But seeing the Navy combing
the sea in search of the gold

755
00:46:41,958 --> 00:46:44,791
was inarguable proof
of the success of our heist.

756
00:46:44,875 --> 00:46:46,916
Come on, who the fuck
tipped off the press?

757
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,791
Everything I just told you,
multiply it by ten.

758
00:46:52,833 --> 00:46:55,708
That is how we close Plan Tom Thumb.

759
00:46:57,166 --> 00:46:58,416
And then finally…

760
00:46:59,416 --> 00:47:02,041
finally we'll be
in a position to negotiate.

761
00:47:06,541 --> 00:47:10,083
Nothing's been moved around for a while.
The garden is well kept.

762
00:47:11,375 --> 00:47:12,500
How many left?

763
00:47:13,666 --> 00:47:15,708
One. It's seven kilometers away.

764
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:16,625
Let's go.

765
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:19,916
It's a stone house built in 1926.
It's rustic.

766
00:47:25,458 --> 00:47:28,041
This one's prefabricated, right?

767
00:47:58,291 --> 00:47:59,708
[whispering] Check the lawn.

768
00:48:08,291 --> 00:48:10,208

[shuddered breathing]

774
00:48:52,708 --> 00:48:53,791
Now what do we do?

775
00:48:54,541 --> 00:48:58,250
Should we go, "One, two, three,"
then we all kill each other?

776
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,166
Very well.

777
00:49:21,791 --> 00:49:23,000
No one can hear us.

778
00:49:24,166 --> 00:49:27,875
-I imagine you've got a plan.
-You're going to give a press conference.

779
00:49:28,791 --> 00:49:31,208
You'll say that after investigation,
the police…

780
00:49:32,625 --> 00:49:33,875
have found the gold.

781
00:49:38,083 --> 00:49:41,166
If I do that, then you'd have me
with my pants down.

782
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:44,208
If I betray you on this,
you'll stop trusting me.

783
00:49:45,583 --> 00:49:48,166
-That's not good.
-It shouldn't be a matter of trust.

784
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:50,458
It should be a matter of life and death.

785
00:49:50,541 --> 00:49:52,333
Suárez, Cañizo, proceed.

786
00:49:53,041 --> 00:49:53,875
On your feet!

787
00:49:56,666 --> 00:49:59,250
[gang grunting]

788
00:50:03,541 --> 00:50:05,041
[Manila] What the fuck is happening?

789
00:50:05,125 --> 00:50:06,416
No fucking clue, Manila.

790
00:50:07,625 --> 00:50:09,791
Trick me, Professor,

791
00:50:09,875 --> 00:50:12,000
and you'll watch your friends be executed.

792
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:14,375
-Suárez, you hear me?
-Copy, Colonel.

793
00:50:15,791 --> 00:50:17,958
[Tamayo] Now that you know
the game we're playing,

794
00:50:18,041 --> 00:50:21,666
do you really want me to go out there
and have a word with the press? Hm?

795
00:50:23,333 --> 00:50:25,250
I told you, "Either we both win…

796
00:50:27,541 --> 00:50:28,666
or we both lose."

797
00:50:30,125 --> 00:50:33,041
I know the plan of how to steal
the gold from the Bank of Spain.

798
00:50:33,666 --> 00:50:35,666
The little I don't know, I assume.

799
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:39,041
You wanna give them back the gold
as a bargaining chip, isn't that right?

800
00:50:39,125 --> 00:50:40,916
But I won't let that happen.

801
00:50:41,833 --> 00:50:44,458
Because the true miracle
was to get it out.

802
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:46,666
And that part is done.

803
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:49,416
You must be the nephew, right?

804
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:52,333
Rafael.

805
00:50:59,458 --> 00:51:01,125
Your uncle wrote this for you.

806
00:51:08,708 --> 00:51:11,208
[camera shutters snapping]

807
00:51:11,291 --> 00:51:12,208
Good morning.

808
00:51:12,708 --> 00:51:15,166
I regret to call you here
on such short notice,

809
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:17,166
but I have an important announcement.

810
00:51:19,958 --> 00:51:22,416
The investigation by the police
has moved forward.

811
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:26,125
We've intercepted two trucks carrying
the gold reserve of the Bank of Spain.

812
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:28,000
-[clamoring]
-Please.

813
00:51:28,083 --> 00:51:29,750
And you'll tell them something else.

814
00:51:29,833 --> 00:51:31,125
That I came into the bank

815
00:51:32,083 --> 00:51:35,875
so I could negotiate the gang's surrender
to prevent any greater harm.

816
00:51:35,958 --> 00:51:38,416
On that matter,
he went down to the bank's basement,

817
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:39,750
48 meters deep,

818
00:51:39,833 --> 00:51:42,458
where the other robbers
are still entrenched,

819
00:51:42,541 --> 00:51:45,666
fending off the attacks
of the State Security Forces.

820
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:49,291
And you'll conclude
with a message of trust and transparency.

821
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:53,000
As soon as you show up on TV, those trucks
will make their way to the bank.

822
00:51:53,083 --> 00:51:55,416
You can escort them along the AP1 North.

823
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:58,375
And how exactly will you give that order
arrested and handcuffed?

824
00:51:58,458 --> 00:51:59,666
It won't be me.

825
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,125
The order is you.

826
00:52:03,208 --> 00:52:05,291
Your announcement on TV is the signal.

827
00:52:05,375 --> 00:52:08,125
-[sirens wailing]
-[Professor] It's all part of the plan.

828
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:11,208
You'll have won,
and the whole world will see it.

829
00:52:12,041 --> 00:52:14,541
[dramatic music playing]

830
00:52:36,541 --> 00:52:38,125
[reporter] A dramatic turn of events.

831
00:52:38,208 --> 00:52:40,208
The gold returns to the Bank of Spain,

832
00:52:40,291 --> 00:52:42,500
in turn de-escalating
the stock market turmoil.

833
00:52:42,583 --> 00:52:47,958
The government and the economists agree
the debt crisis is now under control

834
00:52:48,041 --> 00:52:50,958
and it can be recovered
as fast as its downfall.

835
00:52:51,041 --> 00:52:53,416
Right this moment,
civil servants from the Bank of Spain

836
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:56,000
and the State Security Forces
are unloading the gold

837
00:52:56,083 --> 00:52:58,833
from the trucks to get them
all back into the bank's vault.

838
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:02,166
-What trucks are those?
-[shushing]

839
00:53:03,708 --> 00:53:05,125
It's part of the plan.

840
00:53:05,208 --> 00:53:06,791
A part of the plan I don't know?

841
00:53:06,875 --> 00:53:10,875
Not every secret should be told in bed.

842
00:53:10,958 --> 00:53:12,916
-What the fuck are you saying?
-Relax.

843
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,916
I can't relax, because I don't know
what's happening right now.

844
00:53:17,291 --> 00:53:18,375
It was necessary.

845
00:53:21,625 --> 00:53:24,416
Maybe you can fool everyone else,
but not me, Sergio.

846
00:53:27,208 --> 00:53:28,208
I don't understand.

847
00:53:28,916 --> 00:53:34,250
You would never go into the Bank of Spain
to later return the gold. Never.

848
00:53:34,833 --> 00:53:36,875
Of course not. I'm doing it to save Rio.

849
00:53:36,958 --> 00:53:39,041
Yeah, yeah, sure.
He's a real fantastic kid.

850
00:53:39,125 --> 00:53:41,666
Why don't you tell me
the last part of the plan?

851
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:47,583
No one who's going into the bank
can know the last part of the plan.

852
00:53:47,666 --> 00:53:49,125
Well, I can understand that.

853
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:52,583
However, in that case, I'm out.

854
00:53:58,458 --> 00:53:59,416
[Professor] Martín.

855
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,208
What is a country's gold?

856
00:54:08,916 --> 00:54:09,958
Its wealth?

857
00:54:10,041 --> 00:54:10,875
No.

858
00:54:13,125 --> 00:54:15,708
It's… an illusion.

859
00:54:18,916 --> 00:54:20,375
It's an illusion.

860
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:23,833
It's useless.

861
00:54:23,916 --> 00:54:26,583
Spain doesn't pay
for anything with that gold.

862
00:54:26,666 --> 00:54:28,583
Not one transaction. Nothing.

863
00:54:28,666 --> 00:54:30,583
-It's…
-[Palermo grunts]

864
00:54:30,666 --> 00:54:32,458
It's merely psychological.

865
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:45,625
[Palermo] Gold for brass.

866
00:54:48,083 --> 00:54:51,833
So you'll do to the Bank of Spain
what Berlin did with the Viking treasure?

867
00:54:53,208 --> 00:54:54,833
The exchange was exquisite.

868
00:54:59,125 --> 00:55:01,041
[Palermo cackling]

869
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:04,916
[chuckles softly]

870
00:55:09,875 --> 00:55:11,666
[crickets singing]

871
00:55:13,041 --> 00:55:14,041
Get out!

872
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:24,083
The ingots that came in those trucks
are gold-coated brass.

873
00:55:24,166 --> 00:55:25,875
Just gold-coated brass.

874
00:55:26,875 --> 00:55:28,416
I warned you.

875
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,083
-Suárez, Cañizo, weapons ready!
-Raise weapons!

876
00:55:35,583 --> 00:55:36,541
Tamayo, wait a minute.

877
00:55:36,625 --> 00:55:40,833
Those bars have stopped the debt crisis.

878
00:55:45,375 --> 00:55:47,666
Didn't you portray yourself
as a Robin Hood?

879
00:55:48,166 --> 00:55:50,500
Now you want to steal
the gold of an entire country?

880
00:55:53,583 --> 00:55:56,125
[reflective music playing]

881
00:56:01,625 --> 00:56:02,750
I'm a thief.

882
00:56:04,291 --> 00:56:05,541
Son of a thief.

883
00:56:07,625 --> 00:56:08,791
Brother of a thief.

884
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:18,458
I hope someday
to be the father of a thief.

885
00:56:19,333 --> 00:56:20,958
[chuckles softly]

886
00:56:22,541 --> 00:56:24,708
No one can reject their nature, Tamayo.

887
00:56:25,541 --> 00:56:27,416
I'm leaving you an honorable way out.

888
00:56:28,958 --> 00:56:30,375
Think about it, Colonel.

889
00:56:33,625 --> 00:56:34,583
It's almost funny.

890
00:56:35,166 --> 00:56:37,958
You know perfectly well
it fits with the Spanish tradition.

891
00:56:38,458 --> 00:56:42,083
Which other country could have
a national reserve of fake gold

892
00:56:43,708 --> 00:56:47,250
and still be one of the most
important economies in the world?

893
00:56:48,583 --> 00:56:50,750
It's the Spanish picaresque.

894
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:54,750
The Lazarillo de Tormes,
it wasn't written in English.

895
00:56:55,333 --> 00:56:56,375
Isn't that right?

896
00:56:56,958 --> 00:56:57,958
Tamayo,

897
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,583
you will be a hero.

898
00:57:01,708 --> 00:57:02,541
A hero.

899
00:57:03,041 --> 00:57:05,041
And this small difference of metals

900
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:08,083
will be just another state secret.

901
00:57:08,875 --> 00:57:12,458
It'll pass down from president
to president for the next 50,

902
00:57:13,250 --> 00:57:15,333
60, 70 years, but at the core…

903
00:57:17,875 --> 00:57:19,791
nothing is going to change.

904
00:57:21,708 --> 00:57:23,291
-Load them.
-Load!

905
00:57:24,666 --> 00:57:26,416
No, Tamayo. No!

906
00:57:27,875 --> 00:57:30,416
Did you really think
you'd get out of here that easily,

907
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:33,375
leaving me a national reserve
made of brass?

908
00:57:33,458 --> 00:57:35,250
Tell me where to find the gold.

-Ten.
-Ten!

910

The brass reserve is the best
of your options right now, Tamayo.

911
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:43,708
-Nine!
-You can't do this, Colonel.

912
00:57:43,791 --> 00:57:45,041
You can't do this.

-Eight!
-Eight!

914
00:57:47,250 --> 00:57:50,500
If they shoot, I'll prove that all you
have out there is nothing more than junk!

-Seven.
-I've got videos, I've got documents.

-Everything will go public at once.
-Six.

917
00:57:55,708 --> 00:57:58,250
Do you know what that means?
The debt will skyrocket.

918
00:57:58,333 --> 00:57:59,708
The stock market will plummet.

919
00:57:59,791 --> 00:58:01,250
-The country will be broke.
-Five!

920
00:58:01,333 --> 00:58:03,375
It'll be total bankruptcy.
You won't have a plan B!

-Four!
-Four!

the best of both worlds! Tamayo!

Accept it. All the markets accepted it.

926
00:58:13,625 --> 00:58:16,375
The rest of the world accepted it.
Only you have to accept it.

927
00:58:16,458 --> 00:58:17,666
-It's your only option.
-Two.

-[Suárez] Two!
-[whimpering]

You'll never get the gold, you hear me?

930
00:58:22,041 --> 00:58:24,333
It's not even up to me.
The plan carries on.

931
00:58:24,416 --> 00:58:28,250
The gold is our protection,
the ones inside and the ones outside.

932
00:58:28,333 --> 00:58:30,125
-It'll never be returned.
-One!

[screaming]

934

If you shoot, you'll only have
the dead bodies and bankruptcy.

935
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:36,250
I told you and I'll say it again,

either we both win or we both lose!

Colonel,

938
00:58:45,541 --> 00:58:47,083
it's time for you to face it.

939

-[rapid machine gunfire]

[Tamayo] Good morning.

The heist is officially over.

943

The Army's Special Forces
have managed to gain access

944
00:59:16,958 --> 00:59:19,458
to the bank's basement
with the use of explosives,

945
00:59:19,541 --> 00:59:21,583
releasing the final hostages.
