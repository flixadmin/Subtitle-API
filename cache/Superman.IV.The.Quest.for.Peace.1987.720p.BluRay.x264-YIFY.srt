Superman's mother:
listen carefully, my son.

3
00:06:26,124 --> 00:06:29,628
by now, Kalel,
you are entering

00:06:29,628 --> 00:06:32,631
the atmosphere of
the planet known as earth.

I pray you have made
a safe journey.

be finally alone.

20
00:07:55,422 --> 00:07:56,923
Hi, Mr. Hornsby.

21
00:07:56,923 --> 00:07:57,924
over here.

22
00:07:57,924 --> 00:07:59,926
ah, there you are.

23
00:07:59,926 --> 00:08:00,927
how are you, Sir?

24
00:08:00,927 --> 00:08:01,928
oh, I'm fine, Clark,
how are you?

25
00:08:01,928 --> 00:08:04,431
nice to see you.
It's been a long time.

26
00:08:04,431 --> 00:08:06,433
a long time.

27
00:08:06,433 --> 00:08:08,435
I was just tidying up
for when you show the place.

28
00:08:08,935 --> 00:08:09,936
yeah, well,
didn't I mention

29
00:08:09,936 --> 00:08:11,938
there's an offer
to buy sight unseen?

30
00:08:11,938 --> 00:08:15,442
I won't sell
to a big developer.

31
00:08:15,442 --> 00:08:18,445
anybody who buys it
has to want a real farm.

32
00:08:18,445 --> 00:08:19,946
I don't think we need
another shopping center.

33
00:08:19,946 --> 00:08:23,450
darn it, Clark,
why are you so stubborn?

34
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:25,952
today,
nobody wants a farm.

35
00:08:25,952 --> 00:08:29,956
you blink your eye,
and they'll all be gone.

36
00:08:29,956 --> 00:08:31,458

oh, my gosh,
look at this.

38
00:08:37,464 --> 00:08:41,468
oh, what a joker
old Jonathan Kent was.

39
00:08:41,468 --> 00:08:45,972
I asked him what happened
to the baby's crib,

40
00:08:45,972 --> 00:08:48,475
and he said...

41
00:08:48,475 --> 00:08:52,979
"little Clark must have
had a bad dream and kicked it."

42
00:08:52,979 --> 00:08:55,982
yeah, dad liked
a good joke.

43
00:08:55,982 --> 00:08:57,484
I was wondering,
Mr. Hornsby,

44
00:08:57,484 --> 00:08:58,985
maybe you'd like
to keep these

45
00:08:58,985 --> 00:09:01,488
for your
grandchildren.

46
00:09:01,488 --> 00:09:04,491
why, thank you
very much, Clark.

00:09:15,001 --> 00:09:17,003

pretty fast.

that's my final decision
about the place.

55
00:09:31,017 --> 00:09:33,520
I'm going to hold out
for a real farmer.

56
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,021
you are?

57
00:09:37,524 --> 00:09:40,026
you're just as obstinate
as your father was, too.

58
00:09:40,527 --> 00:09:42,529
I'm sorry.
that's just how It is.

It's a long, long way

you were born.

63

Is making money.

168
00:15:32,671 --> 00:15:35,674
ladies and gentlemen,
my daughter,

169
00:15:35,674 --> 00:15:37,175
Lacy Warfield.

170
00:15:37,175 --> 00:15:38,176
thanks, daddy.

171
00:15:38,176 --> 00:15:40,178
It's very nice
to meet you, Ma'am.

172
00:15:40,178 --> 00:15:43,682
Mr. White,
Lacy will be helping you.

173
00:15:43,682 --> 00:15:46,184
helping me?
helping me what?

174
00:15:46,184 --> 00:15:48,186
I have some mock copies

175
00:15:48,186 --> 00:15:51,189
of our new layout.
super, isn't it?

176
00:15:51,189 --> 00:15:53,692
the suit's not right,
but we'll change it.

177
00:15:53,692 --> 00:15:55,694
excuse me, Mr. Warfield,

178
00:15:55,694 --> 00:15:57,696
but the world Isn't
really on the brink.

179
00:15:57,696 --> 00:16:00,198
Isn't that headline
Irresponsible?

180
00:16:00,198 --> 00:16:02,701
maybe, but It'll sell
a lot of newspapers.

181
00:16:04,202 --> 00:16:06,204
don't do anything rash.

182
00:16:06,204 --> 00:16:09,207
I won't let you turn
this grand old lady

183
00:16:09,207 --> 00:16:10,208
into one of your bimbos!

184
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:11,209
Mr. White.

185
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:14,713
may I point out that daddy
holds all your contracts,

186
00:16:14,713 --> 00:16:17,215
which you will
have to honour.

187
00:16:17,716 --> 00:16:20,218
excusez-moi...
your spoiledness.

188
00:16:20,218 --> 00:16:22,721
why Is Lois trying
to speak French?

189
00:16:22,721 --> 00:16:24,222
I'm flying to Paris

190
00:16:24,222 --> 00:16:26,725
for the emergency
ministers conference--

191
00:16:27,225 --> 00:16:30,228
not so fast.
all trips are cancelled.

192
00:16:30,228 --> 00:16:33,231
my trip to Paris
is cancelled?

193
00:16:33,231 --> 00:16:35,734
Mr. White,
show me your books.

194
00:16:35,734 --> 00:16:38,737
everybody else,
get back to work.

195
00:16:38,737 --> 00:16:40,739
we're being
treated unfairly.

196
00:16:40,739 --> 00:16:41,740
I'll speak
to Miss Warfield.

197
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:42,741
me, too.

198
00:16:42,741 --> 00:16:43,742
excuse me,
Miss Warfield?

199
00:16:43,742 --> 00:16:44,743
yes?

200
00:16:44,743 --> 00:16:46,745
I think I speak for
all of us when I say

201
00:16:46,745 --> 00:16:48,747
that we'll all do
our best to cooperate.

202
00:16:48,747 --> 00:16:50,248
thank you.

203
00:16:50,248 --> 00:16:51,750
but a reporter's
first allegiance

204
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,251
Is to the truth.

205
00:16:53,752 --> 00:16:56,254
this city's people
depend on us.

206
00:16:56,254 --> 00:16:58,256
we can't
let them down.

207
00:16:58,256 --> 00:16:59,758
thank you.

208
00:17:04,262 --> 00:17:06,264
Is he for real?

209
00:17:06,264 --> 00:17:10,268
100%, and I like
him that way, ok?

210
00:17:10,268 --> 00:17:12,771
you have
a thing for him?

211
00:17:12,771 --> 00:17:15,273
for Clark?
no! ha ha ha!

212
00:17:15,273 --> 00:17:17,275
he's kind of cute.

213
00:17:17,275 --> 00:17:19,778
uh, look,
Miss Warfield...

214
00:17:19,778 --> 00:17:23,281
Clark Is the oldest
living boy scout, ok?

215
00:17:23,281 --> 00:17:25,784
he's trustworthy,
he's helpful,

216
00:17:25,784 --> 00:17:27,786
he's loyal,
he's obedient,

217
00:17:27,786 --> 00:17:29,287
he...

218
00:17:29,287 --> 00:17:32,290
I don't know how
to tell you this.

219
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:36,795
I just don't think he'd be
attracted to somebody like you.

220
00:17:36,795 --> 00:17:39,297
don't be silly.
all men like me.

221
00:17:39,297 --> 00:17:41,299
I'm very, very rich.

222
00:17:41,633 --> 00:17:44,719
why don't you have
air travel expenses?

223
00:17:44,719 --> 00:17:46,721
I usually
get air sick,

224
00:17:46,721 --> 00:17:48,723
especially
when It's bumpy.

225
00:17:48,723 --> 00:17:51,226
Lois, get In here!

226
00:17:53,228 --> 00:17:55,730
Lois, explain this
column of figures.

227
00:17:56,231 --> 00:17:58,733
chief, the president's
coming on live.

228
00:17:58,733 --> 00:18:00,235
oh, he is? oh.

229
00:18:00,235 --> 00:18:02,237
I doubt
it's good news.

230
00:18:02,237 --> 00:18:04,239
It won't be
that terrible.

231
00:18:04,739 --> 00:18:06,741
hopefully,
very terrible, Miss lane.

232
00:18:06,741 --> 00:18:08,743
we could double
our circulation

233
00:18:08,743 --> 00:18:11,246
with a good
International crisis.

234
00:18:11,246 --> 00:18:13,748
and because
the summit has failed,

235
00:18:13,748 --> 00:18:15,750
we have no choice

236
00:18:16,251 --> 00:18:18,753
but to strive
to be second to none

237
00:18:19,254 --> 00:18:20,755
In the nuclear arms race.

238
00:18:21,256 --> 00:18:25,260
therefore, I am announcing
the following measures--

239
00:18:28,763 --> 00:18:31,766
I know you're all upset
by the crisis.

240
00:18:31,766 --> 00:18:35,770
the best thing we can do
Is think positively.

241
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:39,274
now, Is there
anything we can do?

242
00:18:39,274 --> 00:18:41,276
doesn't anyone
have a suggestion?

243
00:18:42,277 --> 00:18:44,279
all right.

244
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:46,281
I'll make a suggestion.

245
00:18:47,782 --> 00:18:49,284
let's write
our congressmen.

246
00:18:49,784 --> 00:18:51,286
that'll do
a lot of good.

247
00:18:51,286 --> 00:18:55,290
somebody has to be
an optimist.

248
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:56,791
Jeremy?

249
00:18:58,293 --> 00:19:01,296
what can we do
about the crisis?

250
00:19:01,296 --> 00:19:02,797
he doesn't know
what's happening.

251
00:19:03,298 --> 00:19:07,802
I'd write a letter to someone
that would do some good.

252
00:19:08,303 --> 00:19:09,304
who, Santa Claus?

253
00:19:09,804 --> 00:19:11,806
no! Superman!

254
00:19:11,806 --> 00:19:14,309
Superman, the subject
of our newest exhibit,

255
00:19:14,309 --> 00:19:17,312
has graciously donated a strand
of his hair to the museum,

256
00:19:17,812 --> 00:19:20,815
so we can see how strong
he really is.

257
00:19:21,316 --> 00:19:23,818
here you can see
a 1,000-pound load

258
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:25,820
easily suspended
by his single hair.

259
00:19:26,321 --> 00:19:28,323
the museum will
be closing soon,

260
00:19:28,823 --> 00:19:31,326
so we should
hurry a little.

261
00:19:32,327 --> 00:19:35,330
you know what
I can do with that hair?

262
00:19:35,831 --> 00:19:38,834
you can make
a toupee that flies.

263
00:19:38,834 --> 00:19:40,335
that hair Is a sample

264
00:19:40,335 --> 00:19:42,337
of Superman's
genetic material,

265
00:19:42,838 --> 00:19:44,840
the building blocks
of his body.

266
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:48,343
with enough nuclear power
to mutate the genes,

267
00:19:48,844 --> 00:19:53,348
I can create a being who's
more powerful than him,

268
00:19:53,849 --> 00:19:56,852
who has total
allegiance to me.

269
00:19:57,853 --> 00:19:59,354
[snap]

270
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,862
you better
stand back.

271
00:20:07,362 --> 00:20:09,364
keep your eye out.

272
00:20:11,366 --> 00:20:13,368
[alarm]

273
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:40,812
you wanted
to see me?

274
00:20:40,812 --> 00:20:43,815
yeah, hi, Clark.
please, come in.

275
00:20:43,815 --> 00:20:46,818
I've come up with
a brilliant idea.

276
00:20:46,818 --> 00:20:48,320
oh...really?

277
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,322
well, daddy thinks
It's brilliant.

278
00:20:50,322 --> 00:20:52,324
you'll write this new series

279
00:20:52,324 --> 00:20:54,326
called metropolis after hours.

280
00:20:54,326 --> 00:20:56,328
who, me? I...

281
00:20:56,328 --> 00:20:58,330
It's wonderful.

282
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:00,332
It's great,
Isn't it?

283
00:21:00,332 --> 00:21:02,334
I'm not
right for this.

284
00:21:02,334 --> 00:21:04,336
you're perfect
for it.

285
00:21:04,336 --> 00:21:05,337
you're young,

286
00:21:05,337 --> 00:21:07,339
you're single,
you're successful.

287
00:21:07,339 --> 00:21:09,841
I'm usually
In bed by 10:30.

288
00:21:09,841 --> 00:21:12,344
that's just it.
you don't flaunt it.

289
00:21:12,344 --> 00:21:14,846
you're no slave
to fashion, although...

290
00:21:14,846 --> 00:21:16,848
have you considered
using contacts?

291
00:21:17,349 --> 00:21:19,851
uh, they, uh,
make my eyes itch.

292
00:21:19,851 --> 00:21:23,855
listen, I thought we
could do this together.

293
00:21:23,855 --> 00:21:26,358
I know all
the right places.

294
00:21:26,358 --> 00:21:28,860
I belong
to the right clubs.

295
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,862
we'll start tonight
at the metro club.

296
00:21:31,363 --> 00:21:32,364
oh, tonight?

297
00:21:32,364 --> 00:21:33,865
yeah. It's a date.

298
00:21:33,865 --> 00:21:35,367
a date?

299
00:21:35,367 --> 00:21:36,368
a date?

300
00:21:36,368 --> 00:21:38,870
uh, well, It's just
business, actually.

301
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:42,874
I've got a letter
for Superman, care of me.

302
00:21:42,874 --> 00:21:44,876
Superman
gets mail here?

303
00:21:44,876 --> 00:21:47,379
It's probably just
a picture request.

304
00:21:47,379 --> 00:21:48,380
I could look after
It for you, Lois.

305
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,882
I think It's more
than a fan letter.

306
00:21:50,882 --> 00:21:52,884
I think you
should read it.

307
00:21:52,884 --> 00:21:56,388
"dear Superman,
my teacher Is speaking

308
00:21:56,388 --> 00:21:58,390
"about the president's
speech on the arms race.

309
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:02,894
"we're all
very unhappy about it,

310
00:22:02,894 --> 00:22:05,397
"and I said
we should get Superman

311
00:22:05,897 --> 00:22:07,399
"to rid the world
of nuclear arms

312
00:22:07,399 --> 00:22:10,902
because only
he could do it."

313
00:22:13,405 --> 00:22:15,907
"everybody thinks
I'm a space cadet.

314
00:22:15,907 --> 00:22:17,409
"once you've destroyed
all nuclear missiles,

315
00:22:17,409 --> 00:22:18,410
"they'll see
I was right.

316
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:19,411
"Superman can make sure

317
00:22:19,411 --> 00:22:20,912
"we don't blow
ourselves up.

318
00:22:21,413 --> 00:22:23,915
"thanks a lot. I know
you'll come through.

319
00:22:23,915 --> 00:22:25,917
your friend, Jeremy."

320
00:22:25,917 --> 00:22:26,918
poor kid.

321
00:22:26,918 --> 00:22:29,421
I'll get back to work.

322
00:22:29,421 --> 00:22:31,423
there's an angle
In this.

323
00:22:31,423 --> 00:22:33,425
an angle?
he's just a kid!

324
00:22:33,425 --> 00:22:35,427
daddy loves whipping
up campaigns,

325
00:22:35,427 --> 00:22:37,429
and the public
loves it!

326
00:22:37,429 --> 00:22:39,431
Lacy!

327
00:22:39,431 --> 00:22:41,433
we're going to make
this kid a celebrity.

328
00:22:41,433 --> 00:22:43,435
everybody In the world
will wonder

329
00:22:43,435 --> 00:22:45,937
what Superman's
reply is.

330
00:22:49,441 --> 00:22:51,443
welcome to
metropolis, Jeremy.

331
00:22:51,443 --> 00:22:52,944
I'm Mr. Warfield,

332
00:22:53,445 --> 00:22:54,946
and this is
my daughter Lacy.

333
00:22:55,447 --> 00:22:55,947
hi, Jeremy.

334
00:22:56,448 --> 00:22:57,949
now come along
and meet the press.

335
00:22:57,949 --> 00:22:58,950
have a good trip?

336
00:22:59,451 --> 00:23:00,452
car had a flat.

337
00:23:00,452 --> 00:23:01,953
oh, I'm sorry
to hear that.

338
00:23:01,953 --> 00:23:05,457
here, let everybody
get a picture of you.

339
00:23:05,457 --> 00:23:06,458
that's it, everyone.

340
00:23:06,458 --> 00:23:07,459
Jeremy, over here.

341
00:23:07,459 --> 00:23:08,960
what a boy!

342
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,961
now, come along,

343
00:23:09,961 --> 00:23:13,465
and tell the American public
what you told me.

344
00:23:13,965 --> 00:23:16,968
I said I wish Superman
would've said yes!

345
00:23:16,968 --> 00:23:17,969
did you get that?

346
00:23:17,969 --> 00:23:18,970
man: no, we didn't.

347
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:19,971
say It again...

348
00:23:20,472 --> 00:23:21,473
loudly.

349
00:23:21,473 --> 00:23:24,976
I said I wish Superman
would've said yes.

350
00:23:32,484 --> 00:23:34,986
Miss lane. Miss lane.

351
00:23:34,986 --> 00:23:36,488
take a look at this.

352
00:23:36,488 --> 00:23:38,490
hot off the press.

353
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:39,991
oh, my god!

354
00:23:39,991 --> 00:23:42,494
this time, he's
gone too far.

355
00:23:42,494 --> 00:23:44,496
look, Clark.

356
00:23:44,496 --> 00:23:46,498
can't wait for
the chief's reaction.

357
00:23:46,498 --> 00:23:50,001
I'm through
taking It lying down!

358
00:23:50,001 --> 00:23:52,003
anybody wants me,
I'll be downtown!

359
00:23:52,003 --> 00:23:54,506
chief look
different to you?

360
00:23:54,506 --> 00:23:58,510
he looks like my father
asking for a loan.

361
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:01,012
I'll make sure
he's all right.

362
00:24:01,012 --> 00:24:02,013
look, Clark,

363
00:24:02,013 --> 00:24:04,516
there's nothing
we can do about it.

364
00:24:04,516 --> 00:24:06,518
It's Superman's
decision now.

365
00:24:06,518 --> 00:24:08,520
I'm sure he'll do
the right thing.

366
00:24:47,058 --> 00:24:51,062
may the elders
watch over you, my son.

367
00:24:53,064 --> 00:24:56,067
their wisdom
Is all that Is left

368
00:24:56,067 --> 00:24:59,070
of a once powerful
and enlightened planet.

369
00:25:00,572 --> 00:25:04,075
you must listen
to them, Kalel.

370
00:25:06,077 --> 00:25:07,579
listen.

371
00:25:12,083 --> 00:25:14,586
I know I'm forbidden
to interfere,

372
00:25:14,586 --> 00:25:17,088
and yet the earth
is threatened

373
00:25:17,088 --> 00:25:19,591
by the same fate
as krypton's.

374
00:25:19,591 --> 00:25:22,594
the earth
Is too primitive.

375
00:25:22,594 --> 00:25:24,596
you can flee
to new worlds

376
00:25:24,596 --> 00:25:27,098
where war is
long forgotten.

377
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:29,100
If you teach
the earth

378
00:25:29,601 --> 00:25:32,103
to put its fate
In any one man,

379
00:25:32,103 --> 00:25:33,605
even yourself,

380
00:25:34,105 --> 00:25:36,608
you're teaching them
to be betrayed.

381
00:25:39,611 --> 00:25:40,612
betrayed.

382
00:25:41,112 --> 00:25:42,113
betrayed.

383
00:25:42,614 --> 00:25:43,615
betrayed!

384
00:25:44,115 --> 00:25:45,575
betrayed!

385
00:25:45,575 --> 00:25:47,661
[speaking Russian]

386
00:25:48,161 --> 00:25:50,664
[translator]and because
the summit has failed,

387
00:25:51,164 --> 00:25:52,666
we have no choice

388
00:25:53,166 --> 00:25:56,670
but to strive
to be second to none

389
00:25:57,170 --> 00:25:59,673
In the nuclear arms race.

390
00:26:00,173 --> 00:26:01,675
to that end,

391
00:26:02,175 --> 00:26:05,178
this administration
has pursued,

392
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,681
and will continue
to pursue...

393
00:26:08,181 --> 00:26:10,684
[doorbell buzzes]

394
00:26:10,684 --> 00:26:12,686
therefore--

395
00:26:15,689 --> 00:26:17,691
just a minute.

396
00:26:21,194 --> 00:26:22,195
Lois.

397
00:26:22,696 --> 00:26:24,197
there you are!
what happened?

398
00:26:24,698 --> 00:26:26,199
what do you mean?

399
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,202
"meet me at 6:00 for
the press awards.

400
00:26:29,703 --> 00:26:30,704
wear something
really nice

401
00:26:30,704 --> 00:26:32,205
and don't be late."

402
00:26:32,706 --> 00:26:34,708
were we discussing
some other Lois?

403
00:26:35,208 --> 00:26:36,710
I'm sorry.
I completely forgot.

404
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:39,212
ok, get dressed,
and we'll go.

405
00:26:39,713 --> 00:26:42,215
I'd rather not,
If you don't mind.

406
00:26:42,716 --> 00:26:44,217
I've got thinking to do,

407
00:26:44,718 --> 00:26:46,720
but you go ahead, ok?

408
00:26:49,222 --> 00:26:50,223
Clark...

409
00:26:50,223 --> 00:26:53,226
something's wrong,
isn't it?

410
00:26:54,227 --> 00:26:55,228
hmm?

411
00:26:56,229 --> 00:26:58,732
Is there anything
I can do?

412
00:26:59,232 --> 00:27:01,234
yes, as a matter
of fact.

413
00:27:01,735 --> 00:27:04,237
could we get
some fresh air?

414
00:27:06,239 --> 00:27:08,241
fresh air?

415
00:27:08,241 --> 00:27:09,242
fresh air.

416
00:27:09,743 --> 00:27:12,746
fresh air! sure!
sure, Clark. sure.

417
00:27:12,746 --> 00:27:14,748
who needs rubber chicken
and speeches anyway?

418
00:27:14,748 --> 00:27:17,751
come on, let's get
some fresh air.

419
00:27:17,751 --> 00:27:19,753
breathe really deep.

420
00:27:19,753 --> 00:27:22,756
breathe.
do you feel better?

421
00:27:22,756 --> 00:27:25,759
Clark? Clark! Clark!
things aren't that bad!

422
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:28,762
Clark, stop!
oh, Clark!

423
00:27:28,762 --> 00:27:30,764
Clark! Clark!

424
00:27:40,273 --> 00:27:41,775
Superman!

425
00:28:01,294 --> 00:28:02,796
you ok?

426
00:28:02,796 --> 00:28:03,797
great.

427
00:28:14,307 --> 00:28:16,810
hey, look at that.

428
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:29,823
ready? there you
go! bye-bye!

429
00:28:59,352 --> 00:29:01,354
how'd you like
going solo?

430
00:29:01,354 --> 00:29:02,856
I loved it...

431
00:29:02,856 --> 00:29:05,859
but not as much
as being with you.

432
00:29:05,859 --> 00:29:08,862
I needed to be
with you, too.

433
00:29:08,862 --> 00:29:10,864
you make me laugh.

434
00:29:12,365 --> 00:29:15,368
you're the only one
I can talk to.

435
00:29:15,368 --> 00:29:19,372
sometimes, I don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

436
00:29:19,372 --> 00:29:21,875
I'm always
here for you.

437
00:29:21,875 --> 00:29:23,376
you know that.

438
00:29:23,376 --> 00:29:25,378
you'll do
the right thing,

439
00:29:25,378 --> 00:29:27,380
no matter
what It is.

440
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,882
you always have.

441
00:29:28,882 --> 00:29:30,383
thank you.

442
00:29:30,383 --> 00:29:32,385
you know something?

443
00:29:32,385 --> 00:29:33,386
what?

444
00:29:33,386 --> 00:29:35,889
you don't even
know my name.

445
00:29:35,889 --> 00:29:37,390
Kalel.

446
00:29:39,392 --> 00:29:41,394
you remember,
don't you?

447
00:29:42,896 --> 00:29:44,397
I remember
everything.

448
00:29:44,397 --> 00:29:47,901
"never set one of them
above the rest.

449
00:29:47,901 --> 00:29:49,903
love all humanity
Instead."

450
00:29:52,405 --> 00:29:54,407
that's not fair.

451
00:30:20,934 --> 00:30:21,935
Lois.

452
00:30:21,935 --> 00:30:24,938
time to go.
we'll be late.

453
00:30:24,938 --> 00:30:26,439
huh?

454
00:30:26,439 --> 00:30:30,944
what am I doing out here
freezing my butt off?

455
00:30:30,944 --> 00:30:33,947
oh, you wanted
some fresh air.

456
00:30:33,947 --> 00:30:34,948
that's ok.

457
00:30:34,948 --> 00:30:37,450
I don't want
to catch a cold.

458
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:39,452
I feel kind of weird.

459
00:30:39,452 --> 00:30:42,956
I feel like
I have jet lag.

460
00:30:42,956 --> 00:30:43,957
jeepers.

461
00:30:43,957 --> 00:30:45,458
Isn't that crazy?

462
00:30:45,458 --> 00:30:46,459
yeah.

463
00:30:46,459 --> 00:30:48,962
how about you?
you still down?

464
00:30:48,962 --> 00:30:50,964
nope. things are
pretty clear.

465
00:30:50,964 --> 00:30:54,968
good. too much thinking
wears down your batteries.

466
00:30:56,970 --> 00:31:00,473
Clark, you got to
go with your gut.

467
00:31:00,473 --> 00:31:01,474
mmm.

468
00:31:01,474 --> 00:31:02,976
come on.

469
00:31:08,273 --> 00:31:09,774
ok, here you go,
Jeremy.

470
00:31:10,275 --> 00:31:12,277
Mr. Warfield
wants shots of you

471
00:31:12,777 --> 00:31:14,279
with lots
of local colour.

472
00:31:14,779 --> 00:31:16,781
I can't find
anything special.

473
00:31:16,781 --> 00:31:17,782
hi, Jeremy.

474
00:31:18,283 --> 00:31:19,784
Superman!

475
00:31:19,784 --> 00:31:20,785
jimmy.

476
00:31:21,286 --> 00:31:22,787
what a scoop!

477
00:31:22,787 --> 00:31:24,789
want to take
a walk with me?

478
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:26,791
sure! ok!

479
00:31:27,292 --> 00:31:29,294
jimmy, come on.

480
00:31:42,307 --> 00:31:44,309
you can't!
you'll get towed!

481
00:31:44,809 --> 00:31:47,812
do you know what
a ticket costs here?

482
00:31:47,812 --> 00:31:49,814
Lacy, It's only money!

483
00:31:58,323 --> 00:32:00,826
wait for me upstairs
In the gallery.

484
00:32:01,326 --> 00:32:02,327
sure. ok.

485
00:32:02,828 --> 00:32:03,829
good luck,
Superman.

486
00:32:04,329 --> 00:32:05,831
thanks.

487
00:32:13,338 --> 00:32:16,341
I saved you a seat.

488
00:32:17,342 --> 00:32:18,844
yay!

489
00:32:20,846 --> 00:32:22,347
all right, Superman!

490
00:32:24,349 --> 00:32:26,351
Madame secretary, I don't
represent any country,

491
00:32:26,351 --> 00:32:28,854
but I'd like
to address the delegates.

492
00:32:28,854 --> 00:32:32,858
In that case,
you will need a sponsor.

493
00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:36,862
I believe that will do.

494
00:32:36,862 --> 00:32:37,863
please.

495
00:32:41,867 --> 00:32:43,368
thank you.

496
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:46,872
what's he going to say?

497
00:32:46,872 --> 00:32:49,374
something wonderful.

498
00:32:49,374 --> 00:32:51,376
madam secretary,

499
00:32:51,376 --> 00:32:53,879
honourable delegates,

500
00:32:53,879 --> 00:32:55,881
ladies and gentlemen.

501
00:32:56,381 --> 00:32:57,883
for many years now,

502
00:32:57,883 --> 00:33:00,886
I've lived among you
as a visitor.

503
00:33:00,886 --> 00:33:03,388
I've seen the beauty
of your many cultures.

504
00:33:03,388 --> 00:33:07,893
I've felt great joy In your
magnificent accomplishments.

505
00:33:07,893 --> 00:33:11,396
I've also seen
the folly of your wars.

506
00:33:11,396 --> 00:33:13,398
as of today, I'm not
a visitor anymore

507
00:33:13,398 --> 00:33:18,403
because the earth
Is my home, too.

508
00:33:18,403 --> 00:33:19,404
we can't live In fear.

509
00:33:19,905 --> 00:33:23,408
I can't stand idly by
and watch us

510
00:33:23,408 --> 00:33:26,912
stumble into the madness
of possible nuclear destruction.

511
00:33:27,412 --> 00:33:29,414
and so,
I've come to a decision.

512
00:33:29,414 --> 00:33:33,418
I'll do what our governments
haven't done.

513
00:33:33,418 --> 00:33:34,920
effective immediately,

514
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:38,423
I'll rid our planet
of all nuclear weapons.

515
00:33:38,423 --> 00:33:40,425
yay!
yay!

516
00:33:40,425 --> 00:33:43,428
yay, Superman.

517
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:47,432
way to go, Superman!

518
00:33:52,437 --> 00:33:54,940
Superman!

519
00:34:04,157 --> 00:34:06,660
missile test alpha.
all systems go.

520
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:09,663
4, 3, 2, 1.

521
00:35:58,897 --> 00:35:59,898
oh! hello!

522
00:35:59,898 --> 00:36:01,900
nice to see you guys!

523
00:36:04,402 --> 00:36:06,905
why don't you
just relax there?

524
00:36:06,905 --> 00:36:09,407
I'll get on with
the introductions.

525
00:36:09,407 --> 00:36:10,909
Dixie...

526
00:36:10,909 --> 00:36:12,410
and Trixie.

527
00:36:14,913 --> 00:36:18,917
from the land of the free
and the great cost overrun,

528
00:36:18,917 --> 00:36:20,919
Harry howler,
nuclear strategist

529
00:36:20,919 --> 00:36:22,921
from America’s
top think tank

530
00:36:23,421 --> 00:36:25,924
and a great warmonger
In his own right.

531
00:36:25,924 --> 00:36:28,426
a hearty bienvenue
to jean Pierre Dubois,

532
00:36:28,927 --> 00:36:31,930
nuclear warhead dealer
to the world.

533
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:33,431
his motto is,

534
00:36:33,431 --> 00:36:36,434
"if you didn't
buy It from jean Pierre,

535
00:36:36,434 --> 00:36:39,938
you didn't buy it
on ze black market."

536
00:36:39,938 --> 00:36:41,439
general Romoff.

537
00:36:41,439 --> 00:36:45,944
a lot of people think of you
as the mad Russian.

538
00:36:45,944 --> 00:36:50,448
I like to think of you
as just madly eccentric.

539
00:36:50,448 --> 00:36:51,950
please, be seated.

540
00:36:53,952 --> 00:36:56,955
I know you guys
are overcome with joy

541
00:36:56,955 --> 00:37:00,959
now that Superman
has ended the arms race,

542
00:37:00,959 --> 00:37:03,962
but If we work together,

543
00:37:03,962 --> 00:37:06,464
we can make
the world safe...

544
00:37:06,464 --> 00:37:07,966
for war profits.

545
00:37:07,966 --> 00:37:09,467
make your point.

546
00:37:09,467 --> 00:37:10,969
i, Lex Luthor,

547
00:37:10,969 --> 00:37:13,972
the greatest criminal mind
of the modern era,

548
00:37:13,972 --> 00:37:15,473
have discovered a way
to destroy Superman.

549
00:37:15,974 --> 00:37:18,977
behold,
my unscrupulous friends.

550
00:37:20,979 --> 00:37:22,981
shut those blinds!

551
00:37:22,981 --> 00:37:25,483
the sun is
hurting my eyes!

552
00:37:25,483 --> 00:37:28,487
exactly.
you know what the sun is?

553
00:37:28,487 --> 00:37:30,489
It's a huge nuclear bomb

554
00:37:30,489 --> 00:37:32,991
with so much
radiation In it,

555
00:37:32,991 --> 00:37:35,994
It could incinerate
the average man like that!

556
00:37:35,994 --> 00:37:39,998
yes, but Superman
Is no average man.

557
00:37:39,998 --> 00:37:41,500
aha! right.

558
00:37:43,001 --> 00:37:44,503
what Is your plan?

559
00:37:44,503 --> 00:37:49,007
boys, old Lex here has
kind of a secret recipe,

560
00:37:49,007 --> 00:37:53,011
a genetic stew
In this dish, If you will.

561
00:37:53,011 --> 00:37:57,015
If you'll put this
on one of your missiles,

562
00:37:57,015 --> 00:38:01,561
Superman will have the biggest
surprise of his life.

563
00:38:01,561 --> 00:38:04,564
I'll introduce him
to his first nightmare--

564
00:38:05,023 --> 00:38:06,566
a nuclear man.

565
00:38:06,566 --> 00:38:07,567
he'll pierce his skin.

566
00:38:07,567 --> 00:38:10,028
he'll make him mortal.
he'll become sick.

567
00:38:10,028 --> 00:38:13,031
we'll dance on his grave.

568
00:38:13,031 --> 00:38:17,035
why should we deal
with a scoundrel like you?

569
00:38:17,035 --> 00:38:18,578
remember my motto,

570
00:38:18,578 --> 00:38:21,039
"the more fear you make,
the more loot you take,"

571
00:38:21,581 --> 00:38:23,583
and the more missiles
you guys sell.

572
00:38:23,583 --> 00:38:27,587
yes,
but what's In It for you?

573
00:38:29,047 --> 00:38:31,049
a tiny commission.

574
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:34,052
something appropriate.

575
00:38:35,595 --> 00:38:37,055
a number...

576
00:38:37,055 --> 00:38:40,058
with a lot of zeros
behind it.

and now, Leonard...

581
00:38:55,073 --> 00:38:57,617
your uncle Lex,
with this protoplasm

582
00:38:57,617 --> 00:39:01,621
that I've grown from
Superman's hair cells...

583
00:39:03,123 --> 00:39:06,126
will duplicate
creation itself.

584
00:39:06,626 --> 00:39:07,627
ow.

00:39:08,128 --> 00:39:09,629
now the fabric.

586
00:39:11,131 --> 00:39:14,634
uncle Lex, this ain't
gonna cover him.

587
00:39:16,636 --> 00:39:20,140
the computer inside will
weave enough material

588
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:23,143
to maintain
the high moral standards

589
00:39:23,143 --> 00:39:26,146
that I've always
subscribed to.

590
00:39:26,146 --> 00:39:28,648
you know what
this means, uncle Lex?

00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:32,652
we're going to

are you ok?

I'll sit
this one out.

oh, are you sure?

625
00:42:57,899 --> 00:43:00,902

for your series.

I don't think so.

jeez, what a jerk.

I never
realized It before.

00:44:16,478 --> 00:44:20,482
I guess a lot of
people I know are jerks.

658
00:44:20,482 --> 00:44:23,985
maybe you think I'm one,
so you avoid me.

00:44:23,985 --> 00:44:25,987
no, I don't think that.

660
00:44:25,987 --> 00:44:28,990
I've just been really
busy, that's all.

661
00:44:28,990 --> 00:44:32,994
you know Lois Is doing
that interview with Superman

662
00:44:32,994 --> 00:44:34,996
about his peace Mission?

663
00:44:34,996 --> 00:44:39,000
maybe the four of us
could meet for high tea.

664
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,002
It's very chic.

665
00:44:41,002 --> 00:44:42,504
Paul: could you hand me
those weights, Clark?

666
00:44:42,504 --> 00:44:44,005
uh, excuse me.

667
00:44:44,005 --> 00:44:46,007
wait a minute,
Lacy.

668
00:44:46,007 --> 00:44:47,008
come early.

669
00:44:47,008 --> 00:44:49,010
the view Is so romantic
from my balcony.

670
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:50,011
see ya.

671
00:44:51,513 --> 00:44:53,515
oh, sure. here.

672
00:44:54,015 --> 00:44:56,017
not those!
the other one!

673
00:44:56,017 --> 00:44:58,436
uh...no pain, no gain?

674
00:45:06,486 --> 00:45:08,488
[low-pitched hum]

675
00:45:08,488 --> 00:45:10,490
what was that?

676
00:45:12,993 --> 00:45:15,495
uncle Lex,
you're spooking me out.

677
00:45:16,997 --> 00:45:18,498
[low-pitched hum]

678
00:45:18,498 --> 00:45:20,000
there.

679
00:45:21,501 --> 00:45:23,003
madam...

680
00:45:23,003 --> 00:45:24,504
thank you
very much.

681
00:45:25,005 --> 00:45:26,506
oui, monsieur.
au revoir.

682
00:45:27,007 --> 00:45:28,508
au revoir.

683
00:45:48,528 --> 00:45:50,530
I'm incredible.

684
00:45:53,033 --> 00:45:56,036
uncle Lex, he's like...

685
00:45:56,036 --> 00:45:58,538
he's beautiful.
he's perfect.

686
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:01,541
welcome home,
nuclear man.

687
00:46:02,042 --> 00:46:05,045
your father's
happy to see you.

688
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:24,064
the sun has given him
Internally generated heat.

689
00:46:27,067 --> 00:46:28,568
I'm, uh...

690
00:46:28,568 --> 00:46:30,570
you are...

691
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:34,074
I'm...what?
I'm a genius?

692
00:46:34,574 --> 00:46:37,077
I'm incredible!
I'm...

693
00:46:37,577 --> 00:46:40,080
you are nothing!

694
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:42,082
I am the father now.

695
00:46:42,082 --> 00:46:43,083
you have my voice.

696
00:46:43,583 --> 00:46:46,586
no, you have my voice.

697
00:46:46,586 --> 00:46:49,089
just remember,
I made you.

698
00:46:49,089 --> 00:46:51,591
you're just
an experiment, freako.

699
00:46:54,594 --> 00:46:55,595
what's that?

700
00:46:56,096 --> 00:46:57,097
oh, no.

701
00:46:57,597 --> 00:46:59,099
I'm an experiment?

702
00:46:59,099 --> 00:47:00,600
I'm freako?

703
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:02,602
I was just kidding!

704
00:47:03,103 --> 00:47:06,606
If anyone's freako here,
It's got to be me!

705
00:47:07,107 --> 00:47:08,608
oh, wow!

706
00:47:08,608 --> 00:47:12,112
oh, wow!
I'm break dancing! hey!

707
00:47:12,112 --> 00:47:15,115
this rocks!
hey! oh! whoa...

708
00:47:16,616 --> 00:47:18,618
I made you.
I can destroy you.

709
00:47:18,618 --> 00:47:20,120
destroy.

710
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:23,123
destroy Superman now.

711
00:47:23,123 --> 00:47:26,626
you sweet thing!
but not quite yet.

712
00:47:27,127 --> 00:47:28,128
come here.

713
00:47:28,628 --> 00:47:31,631
We'll discuss
when the proper time is.

714
00:47:38,638 --> 00:47:40,140
uncle Lex.

715
00:47:46,146 --> 00:47:47,647
oh, no!

716
00:47:48,148 --> 00:47:50,650
he's, like...
he's, like, cold.

717
00:47:51,151 --> 00:47:52,652
of course he is.

718
00:47:53,153 --> 00:47:54,654
that's
his vulnerability.

719
00:47:55,155 --> 00:47:57,157
that's the only way
he can be stopped.

720
00:47:57,157 --> 00:47:59,159
what?

721
00:47:59,659 --> 00:48:02,162
Lenny,
my loud-mouth nephew,

722
00:48:02,162 --> 00:48:04,164
he gets his energy
from the sun.

723
00:48:04,164 --> 00:48:07,167
without it, he's
like you at night...

724
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:08,168
useless.

725
00:48:22,682 --> 00:48:24,142
nobody's perfect.

726
00:48:24,142 --> 00:48:26,353
[humming]

727
00:48:30,357 --> 00:48:31,858
you know, I never had
a double date before.

728
00:48:32,359 --> 00:48:35,362
this Is fun.
how do I look?

729
00:48:35,362 --> 00:48:36,863
illegal...

730
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:39,866
like the last six
dresses you tried on.

731
00:48:40,367 --> 00:48:41,868
uh, listen, Lacy,

732
00:48:41,868 --> 00:48:44,371
I don't want
to burst your bubble,

733
00:48:44,371 --> 00:48:47,374
but Clark won't notice
what you're wearing.

734
00:48:47,374 --> 00:48:48,875
[doorbell]
yes, he will.

735
00:48:48,875 --> 00:48:50,377
oh, there's Clark.

736
00:48:50,377 --> 00:48:52,379
you look great.

737
00:48:52,379 --> 00:48:54,381
oh, maybe It's
just Superman.

738
00:48:54,381 --> 00:48:55,882
no.

739
00:48:55,882 --> 00:48:59,386
no, Superman makes
a different kind of entrance.

740
00:48:59,386 --> 00:49:01,388
[ring]

741
00:49:10,397 --> 00:49:11,898
hi, Lacy.

742
00:49:11,898 --> 00:49:12,899
hi, Clark.

743
00:49:12,899 --> 00:49:13,900
could you break a 20?

744
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:15,902
driver didn't
have any change.

745
00:49:15,902 --> 00:49:18,405
yeah, sure.
let me get my purse.

746
00:49:18,405 --> 00:49:19,906
hi, Lois.

747
00:49:19,906 --> 00:49:21,408
hi, Clark.

748
00:49:21,408 --> 00:49:23,910
you won't believe
these questions

749
00:49:23,910 --> 00:49:26,913
Mr. Warfield gave me
to ask Superman.

750
00:49:26,913 --> 00:49:31,418
"are you part of a plot to
weaken our national defence?"

751
00:49:31,418 --> 00:49:33,420
It's his grey matter
that's weakened.

752
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:36,423
how can I ask Superman
these questions?

753
00:49:36,423 --> 00:49:38,425
uh, well,
politely, I guess.

754
00:49:38,425 --> 00:49:41,428
let's see,
I have $18 and...

755
00:49:41,428 --> 00:49:43,930
Clark, she really
likes you,

756
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:45,432
so notice the dress.

757
00:49:45,932 --> 00:49:47,934
my American express card.

758
00:49:47,934 --> 00:49:48,935
dress.

759
00:49:48,935 --> 00:49:50,937
oh, hey! neat dress!

760
00:49:50,937 --> 00:49:52,939
thanks. be right back.

761
00:49:55,442 --> 00:49:57,944
hey, what's that?

762
00:49:59,946 --> 00:50:02,449
now, there's a different
kind of entrance.

763
00:50:06,453 --> 00:50:07,454
hi, Lois.

764
00:50:07,454 --> 00:50:08,455
hello, Superman.

765
00:50:08,455 --> 00:50:09,456
how are you?

766
00:50:09,456 --> 00:50:11,458
I'm fine.

767
00:50:11,458 --> 00:50:15,462
oh! um, Superman,
meet Lacy Warfield.

768
00:50:15,462 --> 00:50:16,463
she's the boss'
daughter.

769
00:50:16,463 --> 00:50:17,964
how do you do?

770
00:50:17,964 --> 00:50:19,966
that's a very
attractive outfit.

771
00:50:19,966 --> 00:50:22,969
I think we better
start our interview.

772
00:50:22,969 --> 00:50:24,471
two's company.

773
00:50:24,471 --> 00:50:27,974
oh, right! yeah!
I'll go get Clark.

774
00:50:27,974 --> 00:50:31,978
he's probably helping
the cab driver change a flat

775
00:50:31,978 --> 00:50:34,981
or some other good deed.

776
00:50:35,482 --> 00:50:37,484
something
smells wonderful.

777
00:50:37,484 --> 00:50:38,985
oh, thank you.

778
00:50:38,985 --> 00:50:41,488
I'm cooking some
scallops and duck

779
00:50:41,488 --> 00:50:44,491
In this wonderful
mushroom sauce with champagne,

780
00:50:44,491 --> 00:50:47,494
In case we got
hungry afterwards.

781
00:50:47,494 --> 00:50:49,996
uh...I mean, later.

782
00:50:51,498 --> 00:50:54,501
you shouldn't have gone
to all that trouble.

783
00:50:59,506 --> 00:51:02,509
should we get on
with the interview?

784
00:51:02,509 --> 00:51:05,512
yes, let's get on with it.

785
00:51:05,512 --> 00:51:07,514
um...

786
00:51:07,514 --> 00:51:09,015
um...

787
00:51:09,015 --> 00:51:11,017
have...have you had
any trouble

788
00:51:11,017 --> 00:51:13,520
confiscating
the missiles?

789
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,522
there always was
the possibility

790
00:51:15,522 --> 00:51:16,523
that some warped
individuals

791
00:51:16,523 --> 00:51:18,525
would take advantage

792
00:51:18,525 --> 00:51:21,027
of the world's
good will, but--

793
00:51:22,028 --> 00:51:24,030
Is there
something wrong?

794
00:51:28,034 --> 00:51:30,036
oh, my dinner!

795
00:51:30,036 --> 00:51:32,038
um, I'll be
right back!

796
00:51:47,053 --> 00:51:48,054
hi.

797
00:51:48,054 --> 00:51:50,056
I Missed you, Clark.

798
00:51:50,056 --> 00:51:53,560
It's so boring up there
with Lois and Superman.

799
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:55,562
let's go do
something wild.

800
00:51:55,562 --> 00:51:57,564
that wouldn't
be polite.

801
00:51:57,564 --> 00:51:59,065
yeah, you're right.

802
00:51:59,065 --> 00:52:02,068
how can one man
be so square

803
00:52:02,068 --> 00:52:05,071
and so delicious?

804
00:52:05,071 --> 00:52:06,573
all right. let's go.

805
00:52:06,573 --> 00:52:07,574
If I have to
face Superman,

806
00:52:07,574 --> 00:52:08,575
so do you.

807
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:11,578
oomph! uh...Lacy.

808
00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:15,081
oh, Clark.

809
00:52:15,081 --> 00:52:18,084
uh...uh...stop.

810
00:52:36,102 --> 00:52:38,104
I don't believe it!

811
00:52:38,104 --> 00:52:41,107
I've never had a duck
turn out so perfectly!

812
00:52:41,107 --> 00:52:42,108
I'm out here, Lois.

813
00:52:42,108 --> 00:52:45,111
oh.

814
00:52:56,623 --> 00:52:58,124
Isn't It beautiful?

815
00:52:58,625 --> 00:53:00,627
the city's beautiful.

816
00:53:00,627 --> 00:53:03,129
the whole world
Is beautiful.

817
00:53:05,131 --> 00:53:08,635
I've always felt moments
like this should be shared

818
00:53:09,135 --> 00:53:12,138
with someone you
care a lot about.

819
00:53:12,639 --> 00:53:14,140
[doorbell rings]

820
00:53:14,641 --> 00:53:16,643
Isn't that
the doorbell?

821
00:53:17,644 --> 00:53:18,645
yes.

822
00:53:35,162 --> 00:53:36,663
Lacy.

823
00:53:38,165 --> 00:53:39,166
where's Clark?

824
00:53:39,666 --> 00:53:40,667
well, the elevator--

825
00:53:41,168 --> 00:53:43,170
never mind.
It's a long story.

826
00:53:43,670 --> 00:53:46,173
It always is
with Clark.

827
00:53:46,173 --> 00:53:47,674
[doorbell rings]

828
00:53:47,674 --> 00:53:49,676
oh, great,
that's him!

829
00:53:51,178 --> 00:53:52,179
Clark?

830
00:53:52,679 --> 00:53:55,182
hi. those bellboys should
look where they're going.

831
00:53:55,682 --> 00:53:56,683
Superman?

832
00:53:57,184 --> 00:53:58,185
Superman?

833
00:53:58,685 --> 00:54:00,687
Is dinner ready?
can we eat?

834
00:54:01,188 --> 00:54:02,689
yeah.
let's go sit down.

835
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:04,691
oh, great.

836
00:54:05,692 --> 00:54:06,693
[crash]

837
00:54:07,194 --> 00:54:08,695
ohh! sorry!
oh, dear.

838
00:54:09,196 --> 00:54:10,697
oh, no, that's ok.

839
00:54:11,198 --> 00:54:12,699
just leave it
there, Clark.

840
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,202
let me
just get a rag.

841
00:54:15,702 --> 00:54:17,037
be right back.

842
00:54:20,624 --> 00:54:22,125
where's Clark?

843
00:54:22,125 --> 00:54:24,628
[high-pitched sound]

844
00:54:25,128 --> 00:54:27,130
Lex: ?? hello, dolly ??

845
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:28,632
?? hello, dolly ??

846
00:54:29,132 --> 00:54:32,636
?? It's so nice to have
me back where I belong ??

847
00:54:34,137 --> 00:54:35,639
don't be concerned,
blue boy.

848
00:54:36,139 --> 00:54:37,140
only you can hear me.

849
00:54:37,641 --> 00:54:39,142
It's my own
private frequency.

850
00:54:39,142 --> 00:54:40,644
you might
call this Lex TV.

851
00:54:40,644 --> 00:54:44,648
look to your left,
tall, dark, and handsome.

852
00:54:44,648 --> 00:54:47,651
I'll blow 20 stories
off that building...

853
00:54:47,651 --> 00:54:51,154
give or take
a floor or two. peace.

855
00:54:53,657 --> 00:54:56,660
I hope Clark's ok.
I better look.

856
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:57,661
ok.

857
00:55:00,664 --> 00:55:01,665
I'm sorry.

858
00:55:01,665 --> 00:55:03,166
an emergency's
come up.

859
00:55:03,166 --> 00:55:05,168
my apologies
to Miss Warfield.

860
00:55:05,168 --> 00:55:06,670
oh, but--

861
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:07,671
Superman!

862
00:55:08,171 --> 00:55:09,172
take me with you!

863
00:55:09,172 --> 00:55:12,175
I could
cover the story!

864
00:55:12,175 --> 00:55:14,177
have you seen Clark?
huh?

865
00:55:22,686 --> 00:55:24,187
guess who.

866
00:55:24,187 --> 00:55:26,690
It's your old friend Lex.

867
00:55:28,191 --> 00:55:30,193
If you'd
planted a bomb,

868
00:55:30,193 --> 00:55:33,196
you'd be miles
from here by now.

869
00:55:33,196 --> 00:55:35,198
this Is my nephew Lenny.

870
00:55:35,699 --> 00:55:36,700
he worships me.

871
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,702
the dude of steel.

872
00:55:39,202 --> 00:55:41,204
boy, are you
gonna get it!

873
00:55:41,705 --> 00:55:45,709
silly me, thinking
I could fool the super guy.

874
00:55:45,709 --> 00:55:49,212
you're right. no bomb.

875
00:55:49,212 --> 00:55:50,213
It's just
that you're so involved

876
00:55:50,714 --> 00:55:52,215
In this world peace bit,

877
00:55:52,716 --> 00:55:55,218
you don't have time
for social calls.

878
00:55:55,719 --> 00:55:56,720
I confess.

879
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:58,722
I tricked you.

880
00:55:58,722 --> 00:56:00,223
you look great.

881
00:56:00,724 --> 00:56:03,727
enough small talk.
what are you up to?

882
00:56:03,727 --> 00:56:06,229
you know,
you're a workaholic.

883
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:09,733
you're playing a good guy
24 hours a day.

884
00:56:10,233 --> 00:56:12,736
why don't you stop
and smell the roses?

885
00:56:13,236 --> 00:56:15,739
get yourself a pet--
a kitten, a puppy.

886
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:17,741
you hate children
and animals.

887
00:56:18,241 --> 00:56:20,243
why are you
In metropolis?

888
00:56:20,243 --> 00:56:24,748
I want to introduce you
to the new kid on the block.

889
00:56:38,261 --> 00:56:40,263
look closely at
the cell structure.

890
00:56:40,764 --> 00:56:43,266
you see
anything familiar?

891
00:56:43,266 --> 00:56:46,269
you've already broken
all the laws of man.

892
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:49,272
now you've broken
the laws of nature, too.

893
00:56:49,773 --> 00:56:52,275
you must have
hidden a device

894
00:56:52,275 --> 00:56:54,778
on a missile
I hurled into the sun.

895
00:56:54,778 --> 00:56:58,281
you know, Mr. muscle,
I'll Miss our chats.

896
00:56:58,281 --> 00:57:01,284
you're the only one
that could keep up with me.

897
00:57:01,284 --> 00:57:02,285
Lenny!

898
00:57:02,285 --> 00:57:04,287
what?

899
00:57:04,788 --> 00:57:06,790
I want to
propose a toast.

900
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:08,792
to a nice guy...

901
00:57:09,292 --> 00:57:11,795
who's about
to finish last.

902
00:57:12,295 --> 00:57:14,297
arrr!

903
00:57:15,298 --> 00:57:16,800
destroy Superman!

904
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:18,301
later.

905
00:57:18,301 --> 00:57:20,303
he's a little bit
anxious.

906
00:57:20,804 --> 00:57:21,805
can you blame him?

907
00:57:21,805 --> 00:57:25,809
not one of
your great thinkers.

908
00:57:25,809 --> 00:57:28,812
but I, In all modesty, am.

909
00:57:28,812 --> 00:57:30,814
the touching thing
about this plan

910
00:57:30,814 --> 00:57:33,316
Is you helped me devise it.

911
00:57:33,316 --> 00:57:36,319
prison twisted your mind
Into a delusionary state.

912
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:38,822
no, no, no. listen.

913
00:57:39,322 --> 00:57:41,825
I escaped from prison
with one thing on my mind--

914
00:57:42,325 --> 00:57:44,327
the end of Superman.

915
00:57:44,327 --> 00:57:47,330
so there I was,
the first time ever

916
00:57:47,330 --> 00:57:49,833
that I didn't
have a long-range,

917
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:51,835
truly devious
criminal scheme.

918
00:57:51,835 --> 00:57:54,838
and then
I came up with it.

919
00:57:54,838 --> 00:57:56,339
with this guy

920
00:57:56,339 --> 00:57:57,841
and you gone,

921
00:57:57,841 --> 00:58:00,844
I'll make a fortune
rearming the world.

922
00:58:00,844 --> 00:58:04,347
you'd risk nuclear war
for your financial gain?

923
00:58:04,347 --> 00:58:06,349
nobody wants war.

924
00:58:06,349 --> 00:58:09,352
I just want to keep
the threat alive.

927
00:58:18,236 --> 00:58:20,322
good night,
sweet prince.

928
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:23,825
parting is...

929
00:58:23,825 --> 00:58:25,327
inevitable.

930
00:58:26,328 --> 00:58:28,830
destroy Superman!

931
00:58:28,830 --> 00:58:31,333
first, I have fun.

932
00:58:51,353 --> 00:58:52,354

Aah!

01:05:07,938 --> 01:05:09,940
yaaa!

953
01:05:22,369 --> 01:05:22,994
I said I'd get you

954
01:05:23,495 --> 01:05:26,498
to run one
of our papers yourself,

955
01:05:26,998 --> 01:05:28,500
and I meant it.

956
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,502
congratulations,
Miss publisher.

957
01:05:31,002 --> 01:05:34,506
thank you, daddy.
that's very nice.

958
01:05:34,506 --> 01:05:36,508
step into
your office.

959
01:05:38,510 --> 01:05:40,512
where'd this
come from?

960
01:05:40,512 --> 01:05:42,514
oh, somebody
brought It in.

961
01:05:42,514 --> 01:05:44,516
we bought It cheap.

962
01:05:44,516 --> 01:05:48,019
ok. this time you have
both gone too far.

963
01:05:48,019 --> 01:05:51,022
you can print your rag
without Lois lane.

964
01:05:54,526 --> 01:05:57,529
and you certainly have
no right to this.

965
01:05:57,529 --> 01:05:59,531
Lois, I'm sorry.

966
01:05:59,531 --> 01:06:01,533
oh, let her go,
darling.

967
01:06:01,533 --> 01:06:03,535
I mean,
she's useless.

968
01:06:03,535 --> 01:06:06,538
and while you're at it,
fire that Clark Kent.

969
01:06:06,538 --> 01:06:08,540
he hasn't been around
or even telephoned.

970
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:11,042
I know. I'm worried.

971
01:06:11,042 --> 01:06:13,545
oh, kitten,

972
01:06:13,545 --> 01:06:15,547
didn't we have
our little talk

973
01:06:15,547 --> 01:06:17,048
about personal
Involvement

974
01:06:17,048 --> 01:06:18,049
with the help?

975
01:06:18,049 --> 01:06:20,051
now that you're
the publisher--

976
01:06:20,552 --> 01:06:21,553
daddy...

977
01:06:21,553 --> 01:06:22,554
yes, darling?

978
01:06:22,554 --> 01:06:23,555
stuff it!

979
01:06:26,057 --> 01:06:28,059
Lois?
Lois, I'm sorry.

980
01:06:28,059 --> 01:06:32,063
I promise you I had
nothing to do with that.

981
01:06:38,069 --> 01:06:40,071
have you heard
from Clark?

982
01:06:44,075 --> 01:06:45,577
no.

985
01:07:11,603 --> 01:07:14,606
oh, Lois. what are
you doing here?

986
01:07:14,606 --> 01:07:16,608
I knew it.

987
01:07:16,608 --> 01:07:17,609
oh, I've just,

988
01:07:17,609 --> 01:07:19,611
uh...just got
a really bad flu.

989
01:07:19,611 --> 01:07:20,612
what do you mean
you knew it?

990
01:07:20,612 --> 01:07:22,113
how'd you know?

991
01:07:24,616 --> 01:07:25,617
you haven't been to work.

992
01:07:25,617 --> 01:07:27,619
you haven't called
the office.

993
01:07:27,619 --> 01:07:29,120
you haven't even
called me back.

994
01:07:29,621 --> 01:07:31,623
how could you not
call me back?

995
01:07:34,125 --> 01:07:36,127
whatever It is,

996
01:07:36,127 --> 01:07:38,129
I guess you've
got your reasons,

997
01:07:38,129 --> 01:07:42,634
but I knew you
were here, you know?

998
01:07:43,635 --> 01:07:45,136
somehow...

999
01:07:45,136 --> 01:07:47,139
somehow something
pulled me here.

1000
01:07:47,139 --> 01:07:50,142
I always know when
Superman's In trouble.

1001
01:07:50,142 --> 01:07:53,145
ha ha! Superman?
something's happened to him?

1002
01:07:53,645 --> 01:07:55,647
everybody's saying
he's dead, but...

1003
01:07:55,647 --> 01:07:58,650
It can't be true.
I just know it.

1004
01:07:58,650 --> 01:08:01,153
I feel It In my heart.

1005
01:08:01,153 --> 01:08:03,655
I think
he just needs help.

1006
01:08:03,655 --> 01:08:07,659
well, wherever he is, Lois,
I'm sure he'll manage.

1007
01:08:07,659 --> 01:08:10,662
well, If he can't...

1008
01:08:10,662 --> 01:08:12,664
manage...

1009
01:08:12,664 --> 01:08:15,167
and he really is...
In trouble,

1010
01:08:15,167 --> 01:08:16,668
then there's, uh...

1011
01:08:16,668 --> 01:08:20,172
there's a few things
I'd like to tell him.

1012
01:08:22,174 --> 01:08:24,176
I'd tell him...

1013
01:08:24,176 --> 01:08:27,679
that I will always
cherish the time

1014
01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:29,681
we spent together,

1015
01:08:29,681 --> 01:08:32,684
and I never expected
anything In return

1016
01:08:32,684 --> 01:08:36,688
and no matter how few
minutes I saw him for,

1017
01:08:36,688 --> 01:08:38,690
It always made me happy.

1018
01:08:38,690 --> 01:08:43,195
and I would tell him...
that I love him,

1019
01:08:43,195 --> 01:08:46,698
and that
I'll always love him,

1020
01:08:46,698 --> 01:08:49,201
and that...whatever...

1021
01:08:49,701 --> 01:08:51,703
happens to the world, I...

1022
01:08:51,703 --> 01:08:53,705
I know that...

1023
01:08:53,705 --> 01:08:58,210
that he's doing his best
to make sure

1024
01:08:58,210 --> 01:09:00,712
that It'll be all right
for the rest of us.

1025
01:09:00,712 --> 01:09:03,215
well, wherever he is,
Lois,

1026
01:09:03,215 --> 01:09:05,217
I know that...

1027
01:09:05,217 --> 01:09:07,719
he would want
to thank you.

1028
01:09:13,725 --> 01:09:15,727
listen, I'm, um...

1029
01:09:15,727 --> 01:09:17,229
I'm pretty tired,
you know,

1030
01:09:17,729 --> 01:09:19,731
so I think I'll
just rest here

1031
01:09:19,731 --> 01:09:21,233
for a while, ok?

1032
01:09:21,233 --> 01:09:24,736
I'll be fine.
It's ok.

1033
01:09:25,237 --> 01:09:26,238
please?

1034
01:09:29,241 --> 01:09:31,243
well, I hope you
feel better, Clark.

1035
01:09:31,243 --> 01:09:34,246
thanks.

1036
01:09:36,248 --> 01:09:38,750
[sniffling]

1037
01:09:40,752 --> 01:09:42,254
um...

1038
01:09:42,254 --> 01:09:45,257
if...if you do
see him,

1039
01:09:45,257 --> 01:09:48,260
um...or--or--or
hear from him,

1040
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:51,763
he might need this.

1041
01:09:58,728 --> 01:10:01,356
oh, Lex,
we're all very pleased

1042
01:10:01,356 --> 01:10:06,862
at all the nuclear missiles
and arms you've helped us sell,

1043
01:10:06,862 --> 01:10:10,866
and, uh, we've decided
to increase your commission.

1044
01:10:10,866 --> 01:10:14,369
oh, guys, really,
that's great.

1045
01:10:14,369 --> 01:10:16,872
It's the least
we could do.

1046
01:10:16,872 --> 01:10:18,874
well, I have
another idea.

1047
01:10:18,874 --> 01:10:21,877
gentlemen, I've decided

1048
01:10:21,877 --> 01:10:24,379
to assume control
of the company.

1049
01:10:31,386 --> 01:10:34,890
my first official act
Is to say, "you're fired!"

1050
01:10:36,391 --> 01:10:38,393
you're mad.

1051
01:10:38,393 --> 01:10:41,396
oh, really?
look at this.

1052
01:10:49,404 --> 01:10:52,407
If you want
a reference for work,

1053
01:10:52,407 --> 01:10:54,409
forget it!

1054
01:10:57,412 --> 01:10:59,414
that was a good bit.

1055
01:10:59,414 --> 01:11:01,917
you know,
with my brains

1056
01:11:01,917 --> 01:11:05,420
and your...
frankly, your brawn,

1057
01:11:05,420 --> 01:11:08,423
the possibilities
are absolutely staggering.

1058
01:11:08,423 --> 01:11:10,926
I could be president,
emperor, king.

1059
01:11:10,926 --> 01:11:13,929
did you see how scared
those guys were?

1060
01:11:13,929 --> 01:11:16,431
and what
do you fear?

1061
01:11:16,431 --> 01:11:18,433
what? now?

1062
01:11:18,433 --> 01:11:20,936
with Superman dead,
and you're on my team?

1063
01:11:20,936 --> 01:11:22,938
It's like I'm the coach,

1064
01:11:22,938 --> 01:11:25,440
and you're the best
power forward ever.

1065
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:26,441
what's to fear?

1066
01:11:39,955 --> 01:11:42,958
all that remains
of krypton's energy

1067
01:11:42,958 --> 01:11:44,960
Is yours.

1068
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:46,962
after It Is gone,

1069
01:11:46,962 --> 01:11:50,966
you will belong solely
to your new home.

1070
01:11:51,967 --> 01:11:56,471
If our dying planet
can save your life, my son,

1071
01:11:56,471 --> 01:11:59,975
we have not died
In vain.

you'll never find her.

If you will not tell me,
I will hurt people.

we've got to tone down

tone down our headlines?

Lacy, that's all
the common man reads.

1111
01:19:25,086 --> 01:19:27,589
we could do with
less sensationalism.

less sensational papers
go broke.

I taught you long ago

1114

that the business of
newspapers Is business.

Is journalism.

you know

what you're doing,

here comes
Mr. Warfield.

1135
01:21:51,233 --> 01:21:54,236
you'd better have
an explanation, White,

or you'll talk
to your lawyers from jail.

you know, I'm not a tycoon.

I'm just
an old reporter,

1139
01:22:01,243 --> 01:22:04,246
but I've read enough
In my own newspaper

1140
01:22:04,246 --> 01:22:06,748
about hostile takeovers
of big companies,

1141
01:22:06,748 --> 01:22:08,750
and you, Mr. Warfield,

1142
01:22:08,750 --> 01:22:10,252
must have been
asleep at the wheel,

1143
01:22:10,752 --> 01:22:13,755
because I convinced
the bankers of this city

1144
01:22:13,755 --> 01:22:16,258
that our daily planet
should be treated

1145
01:22:16,258 --> 01:22:20,262
like a natural resource,
protected from predators,

1146
01:22:20,262 --> 01:22:22,264
so I convinced them
to lend me the money.

1147
01:22:22,264 --> 01:22:24,766
I bought up
the outstanding shares,

1148
01:22:24,766 --> 01:22:29,271
and you, Mr. Warfield, are
now a minority shareholder.

01:22:39,281 --> 01:22:42,284
now, this Is what
I call a newspaper.

1155
01:22:42,284 --> 01:22:44,286
compliments of
the daily planet.

1156
01:22:44,286 --> 01:22:46,288
have a nice day!

1157
01:22:46,288 --> 01:22:47,789
we did it!
we're back!

1158
01:22:50,792 --> 01:22:52,794
hi, everybody.
am I late?

1159
01:22:52,794 --> 01:22:54,796
hey, Mr. Kent.
no, he's not here yet.

1160
01:22:54,796 --> 01:22:56,298
It must have been
an effort for you

1161
01:22:56,298 --> 01:22:58,300
to drag yourself
out of bed this morning.

1162
01:22:58,300 --> 01:23:00,302
I'm feeling better.

1163
01:23:00,302 --> 01:23:01,803
had a visit from
a good nurse.

1164
01:23:01,803 --> 01:23:03,305
It must have been some
pretty good medicine,

1165
01:23:03,805 --> 01:23:05,307
because Miss lane said
you were really ill.

1166
01:23:05,807 --> 01:23:07,309
jimmy, sometimes
all you need

1167
01:23:07,309 --> 01:23:08,310
Is some
loving attention

1168
01:23:08,810 --> 01:23:09,811
from the right
person.

1169
01:23:09,811 --> 01:23:11,313
glad you're back,
Clark...

1170
01:23:11,313 --> 01:23:12,814
and remember...

1171
01:23:12,814 --> 01:23:14,816
I am covering
Superman's press conference.

1172
01:23:14,816 --> 01:23:16,818
you just tape
crowd reactions.

1173
01:23:16,818 --> 01:23:18,820
reactions, ok.

1174
01:23:18,820 --> 01:23:20,322
oh, dear.

1175
01:23:20,322 --> 01:23:21,823
guess I'll need
a tape recorder.

1176
01:23:21,823 --> 01:23:22,824
be right back.

1177
01:23:22,824 --> 01:23:24,326
Clark.

1178
01:23:24,326 --> 01:23:27,329
same old Mr. Kent.
he'll never change.

1179
01:23:27,329 --> 01:23:29,331
I hope not.

1180
01:23:29,331 --> 01:23:30,832
whoo!

1181
01:23:32,834 --> 01:23:36,338
[applause]

1182
01:23:36,338 --> 01:23:37,839
hi, Superman.

1183
01:23:37,839 --> 01:23:40,342
Lois, good
to see you again.

1184
01:23:40,342 --> 01:23:42,344
good to see you, too.

1185
01:23:42,344 --> 01:23:43,845
morning, gentlemen.

1186
01:23:43,845 --> 01:23:45,347
excuse me.

1187
01:23:45,347 --> 01:23:46,848
thank you.

1188
01:23:46,848 --> 01:23:49,351
we've survived
the threat of war

1189
01:23:49,351 --> 01:23:51,353
and found
a fragile peace.

1190
01:23:51,353 --> 01:23:54,856
I thought I could give
you freedom from war.

1191
01:23:54,856 --> 01:23:57,859
I was wrong.
It's not mine to give.

1192
01:23:59,361 --> 01:24:01,363
we're still
a young planet.

1193
01:24:01,363 --> 01:24:03,365
there are galaxies
out there,

1194
01:24:03,365 --> 01:24:05,867
other civilizations
for us to meet,

1195
01:24:05,867 --> 01:24:08,870
to learn from.

1196
01:24:08,870 --> 01:24:11,373
what a brilliant future
we could have.

1197
01:24:11,373 --> 01:24:13,375
and there will be peace

1198
01:24:13,375 --> 01:24:16,378
when the world's people
want It so badly

1199
01:24:16,378 --> 01:24:20,382
that their governments will
have to give It to them.

1200
01:24:20,382 --> 01:24:24,886
I wish you could see
the earth as I do.

1201
01:24:24,886 --> 01:24:28,390
when you really see it,
It's just one world.

1202
01:24:32,227 --> 01:24:33,728
think he'll find us?

1203
01:24:33,728 --> 01:24:37,732
never. we'll lay low
for a while,

1204
01:24:37,732 --> 01:24:39,234
couple of years.

1205
01:24:39,234 --> 01:24:42,237
I'll come up
with a new plan.

1206
01:24:42,237 --> 01:24:45,240
whoa. good thing
I brought my drums.

1207
01:24:51,746 --> 01:24:53,748
[horn honks]

1208
01:24:55,250 --> 01:24:56,751
oh, no!

1209
01:24:58,253 --> 01:25:00,755
uncle Lex,
you won't believe this,

1210
01:25:00,755 --> 01:25:02,257
but It's...

1211
01:25:02,257 --> 01:25:03,258
Superman.
Superman.

1212
01:25:03,258 --> 01:25:05,260
oh, wow!

1213
01:25:05,260 --> 01:25:06,261
oh, wow!

1214
01:25:06,261 --> 01:25:10,765
hey, this rocks! hey!

1215
01:25:10,765 --> 01:25:12,267
morning, father.

1216
01:25:12,267 --> 01:25:13,768
Lenny's been under
a bad influence.

1217
01:25:13,768 --> 01:25:14,769
think you can help him?

1218
01:25:14,769 --> 01:25:16,771
every boy
can be helped.

1219
01:25:16,771 --> 01:25:18,773
I think you're right.
good luck, son.

1220
01:25:18,773 --> 01:25:19,774
come with me,
my friend.

1221
01:25:19,774 --> 01:25:22,277
do you have
a drum set?

1222
01:25:22,277 --> 01:25:25,780
hey! Mozart’s back!

1223
01:25:25,780 --> 01:25:29,784
[whistling

1224
01:25:29,784 --> 01:25:31,286
Dwayne,
Mozart’s back!

1225
01:25:31,286 --> 01:25:33,288
I see him, bubba!

1226
01:25:33,288 --> 01:25:35,290
[whistling]

1227
01:25:35,290 --> 01:25:36,791
shut up!

1228
01:25:36,791 --> 01:25:38,293
[laughter]

1229
01:25:38,293 --> 01:25:39,294
marshal,
take him away.

1230
01:25:39,294 --> 01:25:40,295
thank you kindly,
Superman.

1231
01:25:40,295 --> 01:25:41,296
come on, Luthor.

1232
01:25:41,296 --> 01:25:43,799
one thing--
how'd you beat him?

1233
01:25:43,799 --> 01:25:45,300
high school physics.

1234
01:25:45,801 --> 01:25:47,803
I figured
that If your creature

1235
01:25:47,803 --> 01:25:49,805
was born from the sun,

1236
01:25:49,805 --> 01:25:51,807
that was
his energy source.

1237
01:25:51,807 --> 01:25:53,308
will the world
be vaporized?

1238
01:25:53,308 --> 01:25:54,810
no, Luthor.

1239
01:25:54,810 --> 01:25:56,311
as always,
It's on the brink,

1240
01:25:56,311 --> 01:25:58,313
with good fighting evil.

1241
01:25:58,313 --> 01:25:59,815
see you In 20.

1242
