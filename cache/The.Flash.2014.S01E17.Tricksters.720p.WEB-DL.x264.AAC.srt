00:00:01,302 --> 00:00:05,902
<i>My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

3
00:00:05,906 --> 00:00:07,840
<i>When I was a child,
I saw my mother killed</i>

4
00:00:07,842 --> 00:00:08,841
<i>by something impossible.</i>

5
00:00:08,843 --> 00:00:10,042
Run, Barry, run!

6
00:00:10,044 --> 00:00:12,911
<i>My father went to prison
for her murder.</i>

7
00:00:12,913 --> 00:00:16,849
<i>Then an accident made me
the impossible.</i>

8
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:19,551
<i>To the outside world, I'm
an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

9
00:00:19,553 --> 00:00:22,588
<i>but secretly,
I use my speed to fight crime</i>

10
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,156
<i>and find others like me.</i>

11
00:00:24,158 --> 00:00:26,825
<i>And one day, I'll find
who killed my mother...</i>

12
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:27,860
Mom!

13
00:00:27,862 --> 00:00:29,261
<i>And get justice for my father.</i>

14
00:00:29,263 --> 00:00:32,031
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

15
00:00:32,033 --> 00:00:33,699
Previously on <i>the Flash...</i>

16
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:36,301
You're him.
The Reverse-Flash.

17
00:00:36,303 --> 00:00:37,569
I'm Eobard Thawne.

18
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:39,838
And the Flash's speed
is the key

19
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,774
To my returning to my time.

20
00:00:41,776 --> 00:00:44,476
I've been teamed up with
Mason Bridge, who is a legend.

21
00:00:44,478 --> 00:00:46,311
You're the guy who thinks
Harrison Wells

22
00:00:46,313 --> 00:00:47,379
Is some mad genius?

23
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,048
What do you know about him?

24
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:54,720
I think that maybe
you were right about Dr. Wells.

25
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:57,056
- Which part?
- All of it.

26
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:13,672
Come on.

27
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:21,580
Sweet dreams,
my beautiful boy.

28
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:53,579
- Mom!
- Barry, no!

29
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:54,947
- Mom!
- Get back!

30
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:55,981
Mom!

31
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:06,959
All right, this is everything

32
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:08,627
That we know
about Harrison Wells,

33
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:10,162
Which is actually not a lot.

34
00:02:10,164 --> 00:02:12,264
Didn't you read a whole book
about him?

35
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:13,532
Yeah, 600 pages,

36
00:02:13,534 --> 00:02:17,169
And the big takeaway is,
he's enigmatic.

37
00:02:17,171 --> 00:02:20,873
Your mom was killed
by a speedster.

38
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:23,208
Wells' machine turned you
into a speedster.

39
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,944
That's way too many coincidences
for this old cop.

40
00:02:31,218 --> 00:02:34,686
Do you think that he wanted me
to become the Flash?

41
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:36,822
Everything he's done

42
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:39,825
Since that night
you got struck by lightning...

43
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:41,393
Bringing you to S.T.A.R. Labs,

44
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:43,428
Giving you the suit,
training you...

45
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:46,632
It's all been
to keep you safe.

46
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:48,233
And to make me faster.

47
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:52,471
Wells once said that he needed
more speed from me.

48
00:02:52,473 --> 00:02:54,640
Why?

49
00:02:54,642 --> 00:02:57,743
I don't know.

50
00:02:57,745 --> 00:02:59,444
But he wants something
from you, Barry.

51
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:00,979
We just need to figure out
what it is.

52
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:03,248
Well, let's go get him then.
Let's get some answers.

53
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,918
We can't do that now
as much as we might want to.

54
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,620
Joe, you had your suspicions
about Wells

55
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:10,055
From the very beginning.

56
00:03:10,057 --> 00:03:11,890
You thought that he might be
the man in yellow.

57
00:03:11,892 --> 00:03:14,593
Except the blood from
your house didn't match him.

58
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:17,362
All right, so maybe he's not
the Reverse-Flash,

59
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:19,231
But you think that he knows
what happened that night.

60
00:03:19,233 --> 00:03:21,900
He may have the key
to getting my dad out of prison.

61
00:03:21,902 --> 00:03:24,436
Whatever Wells wants
from you,

62
00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:27,739
It started 15 years ago.

63
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:30,876
He's been patient.

64
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:32,511
Scary patient.

65
00:03:32,513 --> 00:03:34,713
You gotta listen to me
on this.

66
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:39,084
We have to be
just as patient.

67
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:41,553
Yeah.

68
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,266
Oh, wow.

69
00:03:57,303 --> 00:03:59,605
Wow. Look.

70
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:07,246
Wow.

71
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:34,139
Henry?

72
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:35,307
Henry!

73
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:37,609
Henry!

74
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:42,948
- Henry!
- Henry?

75
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,316
Nice name.

76
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,593
Tricked ya.

77
00:04:54,595 --> 00:04:56,628
Look who's back.

78
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,831
My tricks.
My treat.

79
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:05,470
But I'll give you
something good to eat.

80
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:09,841
Today's special.
A city in ashes.

81
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:12,611
The Trickster proudly
welcomes you all

82
00:05:12,613 --> 00:05:16,281
To the new disorder.

83
00:05:16,283 --> 00:05:18,984
Talking in the third person.
That's never a good sign.

84
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:20,652
You're just mad
because he named himself.

85
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,521
Actually, he didn't.

86
00:05:22,523 --> 00:05:24,790
20 years ago, Central City
was hit by a series

87
00:05:24,792 --> 00:05:26,124
Of terrorist attacks.

88
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:29,027
One man killed at least
ten civilians, two cops.

89
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:32,631
That guy called himself
the Trickster.

90
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:35,701
Whoa. Someone was rocking
the unitard.

91
00:05:35,703 --> 00:05:37,569
James Jesse?

92
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:39,738
Like Jesse James,
only more twisted.

93
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,506
Where is
this Mr. Jesse now?

94
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:45,243
He's serving several
life sentences at Iron Heights.

95
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:46,912
He was just about
the most dangerous thing

96
00:05:46,914 --> 00:05:48,246
Central city had ever seen.

97
00:05:48,248 --> 00:05:51,416
You mean until the
particle accelerator blew up.

98
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:52,884
Um...

99
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:55,754
Barry and I will go see this
James Jesse at Iron Heights,

100
00:05:55,756 --> 00:05:57,055
See if he can give us something

101
00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:58,957
That can help us
catch his groupie.

102
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:02,694
I'll analyze the video and see
if I can figure out the source.

103
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,730
Hey, Joe.

104
00:06:04,732 --> 00:06:07,833
Is Barry doing all right?
He seems cranky.

105
00:06:07,835 --> 00:06:10,235
Even the Flash wakes up
on the wrong side of the bed

106
00:06:10,237 --> 00:06:11,436
Some mornings.

107
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:13,939
He's fine.

108
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:21,580
- Mom!
- Nora, hold on!

109
00:06:21,582 --> 00:06:23,181
Run, Barry, run!

110
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:48,940
Gideon, what's happening
to me?

111
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:50,742
Your latest time jump
against the Flash

112
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,411
Caused a massive drain
on your powers.

113
00:06:52,413 --> 00:06:54,746
Your cells contain no trace
of the speed force.

114
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:55,881
That's impossible.

115
00:06:55,883 --> 00:06:57,783
Your ability to move
at super-speed

116
00:06:57,785 --> 00:07:00,919
As well as travel in time
has been completely depleted.

117
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:03,622
How am I supposed
to get back?

118
00:07:03,624 --> 00:07:06,658
You can't.

119
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:28,413
Never seen this part
of the prison before.

120
00:07:28,415 --> 00:07:30,782
Yeah, I had to have this cell
specially built

121
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,651
For James Jesse
about five years ago.

122
00:07:32,653 --> 00:07:34,152
Why is that?

123
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:37,923
A criminal psychologist set up
weekly visits with him.

124
00:07:37,925 --> 00:07:41,526
James talked the shrink
into committing suicide.

125
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:46,498
Oh, you're gonna need these.

126
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,367
Okay.

127
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:04,015
Gentlemen.

128
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:07,219
Please, be seated.

129
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:13,792
I'm Detective Joe west.
This is Barry Allen.

130
00:08:13,794 --> 00:08:16,561
Uh, we'd like to ask you
a few questions.

131
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:19,297
Mmm.

132
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:24,803
I can smell them in your pocket.

133
00:08:24,805 --> 00:08:27,806
Mmm.

134
00:08:27,808 --> 00:08:30,942
Yesterday, hundreds
of these parachute bombs

135
00:08:30,944 --> 00:08:35,046
Were released
throughout Central City.

136
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:37,382
Huh.

137
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:39,851
Fun idea

138
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:43,788
But not
an effective delivery system.

139
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,323
How many died?

140
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:46,591
No one, luckily.

141
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:49,895
You know, when I was free
and at my height,

142
00:08:49,897 --> 00:08:52,864
A day without casualties
was like...

143
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:55,800
Well, like the cubs
winning the pennant...

144
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:57,669
It just never happened.

145
00:09:01,942 --> 00:09:04,442
The explosives they found
in all the parachute bombs

146
00:09:04,444 --> 00:09:06,878
Had the same explosive
composition as the bombs

147
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,813
You set off 20 years ago.

148
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:10,849
That's impossible.

149
00:09:10,851 --> 00:09:12,384
I never told anyone
that formula.

150
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:15,153
The signatures are
an exact match.

151
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:16,888
He called himself
the Trickster too,

152
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,189
Just like you.

153
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:21,393
He is nothing like me,
Detective.

154
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:23,428
Nothing!

155
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:26,531
Do you know who he is?

156
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,106
Oh.

157
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:42,547
If I did, I would tell you,

158
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:45,317
So you could find him,
cut off his head,

159
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:47,652
And throw it
right in his face.

160
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:50,655
No, this is obviously
the work

161
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:53,224
Of a rank amateur at best.

162
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:57,262
A mere pretender angling
for my throne.

163
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,231
I hear you.

164
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:03,568
So...

165
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,370
Help us catch him.

166
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:07,372
Prove there's only
one Trickster.

167
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:14,613
Trying to trick the Trickster,
Joseph, hmm?

168
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:18,450
No.

169
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:23,888
There's only one way
this could happen.

170
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,824
Whoever he is,

171
00:10:25,826 --> 00:10:30,095
He must have found my lair.

172
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:32,998
I ask only one thing,

173
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,834
When you find
this schtick stealer,

174
00:10:35,836 --> 00:10:40,839
This gimmick grabber,
this pathetic wannabe, fake,

175
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:45,810
Make sure your safety's off.

176
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:55,153
Something has happened
to Mason Bridge.

177
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,921
No one has seen or heard
from him in a week.

178
00:10:56,923 --> 00:10:59,491
Well, he's a journalist, Iris.
Maybe he's on a story.

179
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:01,760
Then why hasn't he answered
his phone or his emails?

180
00:11:01,762 --> 00:11:04,529
Maybe he stumbled on the wrong
story and he's laying low.

181
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:06,331
You don't know him
like I do, Eddie.

182
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:09,100
When mason is on a story,
nothing is getting in his way.

183
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:11,536
I mean, he considers threats
minor annoyances.

184
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:13,271
Then maybe he's on a bender
or he met a girl

185
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:15,306
Worth disappearing
for a week over.

186
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:17,509
Look, he also said that
something weird was going on

187
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:19,010
At S.T.A.R. Labs.

188
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,779
Eddie, something has happened
to him.

189
00:11:20,781 --> 00:11:22,714
Something bad.
I can feel it.

190
00:11:22,716 --> 00:11:23,848
Please.

191
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,283
Look, Captain Singh
has everyone

192
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:26,618
On the Central City park
bomber.

193
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,054
But as soon as I can,
I'll look into Bridge.

194
00:11:29,056 --> 00:11:30,922
I promise.

195
00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:33,124
Okay.

196
00:11:36,596 --> 00:11:39,931
This looks like nobody's
been here since the '90s.

197
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:42,367
Yeah, look at this thing.

198
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:43,601
You really think
Jesse doesn't know

199
00:11:43,603 --> 00:11:45,236
Who this new Trickster
guy is?

200
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:47,205
He seemed pretty ticked off
that someone

201
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:50,341
Was besmirching his bad name.

202
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:52,343
Joe.

203
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:05,690
Let's see what he's got
stashed in there.

204
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:06,691
Yeah.

205
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:20,071
- Damn.
- You good?

206
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:29,948
The copycat...
he took everything.

207
00:12:40,227 --> 00:12:42,293
Hey, c-can we have
a second?

208
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:44,129
- Yeah, sure.
- Just...

209
00:12:44,131 --> 00:12:45,964
Dad. Hey.

210
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:47,966
Barry.

211
00:12:47,968 --> 00:12:50,735
Hey.

212
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:52,036
What are you doing here?

213
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:54,038
Uh, Joe and I have
some questions for an inmate

214
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,206
About a bombing case.

215
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:58,943
Dad, listen, I'm close.

216
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,378
The man that
put you in here...

217
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,347
I'm getting close,
closer than I've ever been.

218
00:13:02,349 --> 00:13:05,316
Barry, we have
talked about this.

219
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:07,485
I know, and I'm done talking.

220
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:11,322
You're not gonna pay
for another man's crime anymore.

221
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:14,425
Just hang in there, okay?

222
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:18,096
Joe, what's he talking about?

223
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:22,600
Like he said, Henry,
just hang in there.

224
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:29,240
What?
No candy, fellas?

225
00:13:29,242 --> 00:13:31,743
That storage space you
sent us to was booby-trapped.

226
00:13:31,745 --> 00:13:34,846
You can never be too careful

227
00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:36,414
With your private things.

228
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,082
You were protecting nothing.

229
00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:39,684
Your secret stash was empty.

230
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:41,052
What do you mean?

231
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:42,987
No firearms,
none of your explosives,

232
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,088
Nothing.

233
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,256
Whatever you had in there,

234
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:47,358
It was stolen, all of it.

235
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,063
No.
He's stealing my legacy.

236
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:54,666
Whoever this is,
you need to find him.

237
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:56,601
I will not let this...
this...

238
00:13:56,603 --> 00:13:59,437
- Trickster?
- That is my name! Mine!

239
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:01,940
What was in that room?
What were you keeping there?

240
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:06,077
A bomb.
A really big bomb.

241
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,246
How big?

242
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:10,982
Bye-bye, Central City.

243
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:14,752
Cisco.

244
00:14:14,754 --> 00:14:16,688
Yo, this Trickster guy
just posted a vlog.

245
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:17,655
You gotta see this.

246
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:18,957
I'm sending you the link
right now.

247
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,392
Okay.

248
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:23,428
Denizens of Central City,

249
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:27,565
Or those of you who remain,

250
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:31,669
Welcome to boom day.

251
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:33,972
I'm very proud to report
that my first trick

252
00:14:33,974 --> 00:14:35,073
Was an exploding success.

253
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:36,074
Show him.

254
00:14:36,076 --> 00:14:38,576
But I think you all deserve

255
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:41,045
Something much, uh, bigger.

256
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:44,983
- No, no, no, no, no.
- So for my next trick...

257
00:14:44,985 --> 00:14:47,018
Take off my mask, you fraud.

258
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,586
Keep your eyes glued...

259
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:52,090
Pretender. Sham.

260
00:14:52,092 --> 00:14:53,725
Take off my mask.

261
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:56,794
Take off my mask.

262
00:14:56,796 --> 00:14:58,630
Take off my mask!

263
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,609
This was posted a few hours ago.

264
00:15:11,611 --> 00:15:14,512
Whoever this Trickster is,
he's certainly not shy.

265
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:18,683
Well, not every criminal
likes to hide in the dark.

266
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:21,586
Cisco, can you trace
where the video was posted from?

267
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:24,756
I tried, but this guy
is using some crazy

268
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:27,358
Felicity-caliber scrambler
like I've never seen.

269
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,060
The origin of the upload's
coming from hundreds

270
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:30,561
Of different locations.

271
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:32,764
Until he uploads another video,
it's gonna be tough.

272
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:35,166
This psychopath has the
capability to destroy the city.

273
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:37,835
Hey, I said tough,
not impossible.

274
00:15:37,837 --> 00:15:40,605
Barry, we'll catch him.
We always do.

275
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:43,074
Mr. Allen,

276
00:15:43,076 --> 00:15:44,642
A word please?

277
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:57,889
I know what's going on
with you.

278
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:07,065
I know what you're thinking.

279
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:10,501
Do you?

280
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:12,136
I know going up
to Iron Heights prison

281
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:14,772
And conversing with Mr. Jesse
has brought about feelings

282
00:16:14,774 --> 00:16:15,773
Of your father.

283
00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:17,241
How could it not?

284
00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:19,577
Yeah, no, it's, uh,

285
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:24,115
It's been really tough
knowing that my mom's killer

286
00:16:24,117 --> 00:16:27,018
Is still out there.

287
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,053
Of course.

288
00:16:29,055 --> 00:16:32,023
But we'll find him, together.

289
00:16:32,025 --> 00:16:33,658
You have my word.

290
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,127
Thank you.

291
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:38,062
For now, how about we focus

292
00:16:38,064 --> 00:16:40,798
On finding this Trickster
before anybody else gets hurt?

293
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:48,806
I have to go.

294
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:53,011
But thanks for the pep talk.

295
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:55,346
I'm always here for you.

296
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:03,621
Research laboratories
unconnected to the government,

297
00:17:03,623 --> 00:17:05,356
Unconnected
to any business interests

298
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:07,058
Or any of that kind of stuff.

299
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,826
And then we build right downtown

300
00:17:08,828 --> 00:17:10,461
In the heart of the city,
in the epicenter,

301
00:17:10,463 --> 00:17:12,964
And we become
the heart of the city.

302
00:17:12,966 --> 00:17:15,400
We become the heart
of the nation.

303
00:17:15,402 --> 00:17:16,968
We change the way you think
about the sciences,

304
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:20,738
And then...

305
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,140
What?

306
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:25,076
Just that my father
would have loved you...

307
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:27,612
As much as I do.

308
00:17:29,616 --> 00:17:33,651
Well, I wish
I could have met him.

309
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:42,460
Oh.

310
00:17:42,462 --> 00:17:44,962
And what would you call
these laboratories?

311
00:17:44,964 --> 00:17:47,432
Well, we, Tess Morgan,

312
00:17:47,434 --> 00:17:50,601
Would call them
"the technological engineering

313
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:54,672
Scientific studies,"
or T.E.S.S., for short.

314
00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:57,909
Well, that is
very, very sweet.

315
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:02,213
But how about...

316
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:05,516
"scientific and technological

317
00:18:05,518 --> 00:18:08,820
Advanced research
laboratories,"

318
00:18:08,822 --> 00:18:13,891
Or S.T.A.R. Labs,
for short?

319
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:21,132
Because in the vast night sky,
you, Harrison Wells,

320
00:18:21,134 --> 00:18:23,401
are the only star I see,

321
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:29,440
that's gonna get you kissed.

322
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:55,533
I thought you were
a full-time reporter now.

323
00:18:55,535 --> 00:18:57,635
Why are we meeting here?

324
00:18:57,637 --> 00:19:00,872
I still have a key.

325
00:19:00,874 --> 00:19:04,609
And this is kind of
our place, right?

326
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:11,516
What's up?

327
00:19:11,518 --> 00:19:15,052
My coworker Mason Bridge
is missing.

328
00:19:15,054 --> 00:19:17,788
He's not at home.
He's not answering his phone.

329
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,190
I mean, it's not like him.

330
00:19:19,192 --> 00:19:23,494
I am really worried that
something bad has happened.

331
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,096
I'm sure he's fine.

332
00:19:25,098 --> 00:19:28,900
That's what Eddie says.
That's what everyone is saying.

333
00:19:28,902 --> 00:19:31,169
Please, will you
look into it?

334
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:34,805
For me?

335
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:38,042
For you.

336
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:41,012
Thanks.

337
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:45,516
Um, are you okay?

338
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:48,986
You seem like you have
a heavy heart.

339
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:56,994
Sometimes I'm not sure
why I wear a mask with you.

340
00:19:56,996 --> 00:19:59,830
Well, maybe one day
you'll take it off.

341
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:04,402
Heads up.
Trickster's broadcasting again.

342
00:20:04,404 --> 00:20:06,537
Can I borrow your laptop?

343
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:09,173
Um, sure.
Help...

344
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:12,076
Help yourself.

345
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:14,278
Get ready for the games
to begin!

346
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:18,349
I have... A bomb.

347
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:20,117
It's a big bomb.

348
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:21,619
It'll make a big bang

349
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:22,853
and then a big hole

350
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:27,558
and then a big drop
in the pop...ulation.

351
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:33,264
But never say the Trickster

352
00:20:33,266 --> 00:20:35,066
Is not fair.

353
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:41,872
The bomb is somewhere between
52nd street and avenue B.

354
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:44,242
I want all units,
every uniform, every detective

355
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:46,844
Searching that area
right now.

356
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:48,112
Somehow we need
to alert the Flash.

357
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:50,948
Something tells me
he already knows.

358
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:57,922
Guys, I can't find it.
I need your help.

359
00:20:57,924 --> 00:21:00,157
There's nothing on traffic cams
or CCTV.

360
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,159
I retasked
the S.T.A.R. Labs satellite

361
00:21:02,161 --> 00:21:03,728
To scan the area
for incendiary devices.

362
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,096
A bomb that large
should be giving off

363
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:06,831
Some kind of thermal
or chemical signature.

364
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,466
Well, then
why can't you find it?

365
00:21:08,468 --> 00:21:09,834
Because it's a trick.

366
00:21:09,836 --> 00:21:11,135
The bomb's not there.

367
00:21:11,137 --> 00:21:13,237
No, it has to be.
I'm gonna keep looking.

368
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:15,106
That is what he wants,
for you and the police

369
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:16,841
To keep running around
in circles.

370
00:21:16,843 --> 00:21:18,376
There is something else
going on, Barry.

371
00:21:18,378 --> 00:21:21,245
I can feel it.
Now, trust me.

372
00:21:21,247 --> 00:21:24,615
- I'm gonna keep looking.
- Barry?

373
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:27,385
Why doesn't he just
listen to you?

374
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:39,797
I found it.

375
00:21:58,384 --> 00:22:01,852
Uh-oh, there's an explosion
at Iron Heights.

376
00:22:01,854 --> 00:22:03,120
This was all a diversion.

377
00:22:03,122 --> 00:22:06,757
The prison was
the real target.

378
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:08,592
James Jesse.

379
00:22:08,594 --> 00:22:11,162
I guess he's tricked us all.

380
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:14,498
Joe, there's no bomb
in this city.

381
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,966
It was a diversion
so the Trickster

382
00:22:15,968 --> 00:22:17,902
Could help James Jesse
escape.

383
00:22:17,904 --> 00:22:19,070
I know.

384
00:22:19,072 --> 00:22:21,672
We just got surveillance footage
from Iron Heights.

385
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:23,607
Jesse got away.

386
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:27,078
Barry, look,
they took a hostage.

387
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:30,214
Well, who did he take?
A guard? The warden?

388
00:22:30,216 --> 00:22:32,249
No.
Your dad.

389
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:46,497
You have to admit,

390
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:50,267
That was one hell of a trick.

391
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:02,346
I cannot believe
we're finally in the same room.

392
00:23:02,348 --> 00:23:06,083
I mean, you're my hero.

393
00:23:06,085 --> 00:23:08,252
You need a better
role model, kid.

394
00:23:08,254 --> 00:23:11,589
Can't you see?
He's just using you.

395
00:23:11,591 --> 00:23:14,792
Why did we bring him along?
Huh?

396
00:23:14,794 --> 00:23:17,695
Because his son
works for the CCPD.

397
00:23:17,697 --> 00:23:19,663
Should we find ourselves
in a jam,

398
00:23:19,665 --> 00:23:22,466
A cop's dad makes
an excellent bargaining chip.

399
00:23:22,468 --> 00:23:24,235
Right.

400
00:23:24,237 --> 00:23:28,272
I wouldn't worry too much about
what the cops might do to you.

401
00:23:28,274 --> 00:23:29,673
Really?

402
00:23:29,675 --> 00:23:30,741
If the police aren't able
to find you,

403
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:33,711
Trust me, the Flash will.

404
00:23:35,448 --> 00:23:37,715
Here's hoping.

405
00:23:37,717 --> 00:23:39,150
So what's next?

406
00:23:39,152 --> 00:23:40,885
In your last letter,
you said you had something big

407
00:23:40,887 --> 00:23:42,420
In mind for when you got out.

408
00:23:42,422 --> 00:23:45,756
I've had 20 years to come up
with the perfect trick.

409
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:49,427
It's going to be
my masterpiece.

410
00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:50,761
My <i>Mona Lisa.</i>

411
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:54,498
My <i>Breaking Bad</i> season five.

412
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,701
They gave me cable in prison
so I'd stop killing the guards.

413
00:23:57,703 --> 00:24:00,371
Right.

414
00:24:00,373 --> 00:24:05,009
There's just one thing
I've been dying to ask.

415
00:24:05,011 --> 00:24:07,411
Why did you choose me?

416
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:11,449
Because I knew
you had the strength

417
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:13,350
To fulfill my legacy.

418
00:24:13,352 --> 00:24:16,654
Besides,

419
00:24:16,656 --> 00:24:20,057
It was in your blood.

420
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:21,192
Wait.

421
00:24:21,194 --> 00:24:24,462
What do you mean in...
in my blood?

422
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:28,499
The real reason
I tracked you down

423
00:24:28,501 --> 00:24:34,371
And groomed you to be the best
you could possibly be, Axel...

424
00:24:34,373 --> 00:24:38,375
I am your father.

425
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:54,758
We were able to identify
the other Trickster.

426
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,861
His name's Axel Walker,
age 25.

427
00:24:56,863 --> 00:24:58,929
Apparently him and James
have been corresponding

428
00:24:58,931 --> 00:25:00,998
Through snail mail
for over a decade.

429
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,700
I should have been there.

430
00:25:02,702 --> 00:25:04,401
We're gonna find
your dad, okay?

431
00:25:04,403 --> 00:25:07,905
Definitely.

432
00:25:07,907 --> 00:25:10,174
I guess I should have
listened to you.

433
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:21,852
Sorry, I am so tired.

434
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:24,021
I think I'm just gonna
put on my pajamas,

435
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:25,789
Go straight to bed
when we get home.

436
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:28,158
- Really?
- No.

437
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,862
Definitely not
wearing pajamas.

438
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:35,399
Hello.

439
00:26:03,863 --> 00:26:07,031
No, no, no.
Tess.

440
00:26:07,033 --> 00:26:09,500
Tess.
Tess! Oh, no.

441
00:26:09,502 --> 00:26:14,104
Oh, no.
Tess. Tess.

442
00:26:14,106 --> 00:26:15,773
Oh, thank god.
You gotta help me.

443
00:26:15,775 --> 00:26:19,009
Please help me.
Oh.

444
00:26:19,011 --> 00:26:21,445
She... she's...

445
00:26:21,447 --> 00:26:23,113
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

446
00:26:23,115 --> 00:26:25,916
Help. Call someone!
Call anyone!

447
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:27,785
Can't you see she's dying?

448
00:26:27,787 --> 00:26:30,087
This woman has been dead
for centuries.

449
00:26:35,393 --> 00:26:37,461
Help!

450
00:26:49,407 --> 00:26:51,809
You okay?

451
00:26:51,811 --> 00:26:53,277
Do you think my dad
is still alive?

452
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,579
Yes. Yes, he is.
Of course.

453
00:26:55,581 --> 00:26:58,749
Jesse only took your pop
to use as leverage.

454
00:26:58,751 --> 00:27:00,985
He might be crazy,
but he's not stupid.

455
00:27:00,987 --> 00:27:05,022
And everyone upstairs
is looking to find him.

456
00:27:05,024 --> 00:27:08,392
So now I'm supposed to just

457
00:27:08,394 --> 00:27:10,361
Leave my dad's fate
in the hands of a man

458
00:27:10,363 --> 00:27:13,564
Who may have had something
to do with my mom's murder.

459
00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:17,901
Joe, I can't do this.

460
00:27:17,903 --> 00:27:20,237
Yes, you can.

461
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:21,338
It just doesn't make
any sense.

462
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,040
I mean,
if Wells is a murderer,

463
00:27:23,042 --> 00:27:25,175
Then why does he want
to help me?

464
00:27:25,177 --> 00:27:27,478
Why has he helped me
stop so many criminals?

465
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:31,248
Or saved Ronnie?

466
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,017
Why didn't I see this?

467
00:27:33,019 --> 00:27:36,253
I spent 1/10 as much time
with him as you did,

468
00:27:36,255 --> 00:27:38,622
And he almost had me
believing in him.

469
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:40,524
Almost.

470
00:27:40,526 --> 00:27:44,795
Look, whatever else he is,

471
00:27:44,797 --> 00:27:46,997
He is Harrison Wells.

472
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:48,666
You love science.
He is science.

473
00:27:48,668 --> 00:27:53,070
It's like you made
best friends with Einstein.

474
00:27:53,072 --> 00:27:55,706
You're saying I wanted
to be tricked.

475
00:27:55,708 --> 00:27:58,242
You always want to be
the person

476
00:27:58,244 --> 00:27:59,510
Who sees the best in people.

477
00:27:59,512 --> 00:28:00,878
I've been a cop for 25 years.

478
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,847
All I can see is the flaws,

479
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:05,282
The lies,

480
00:28:05,284 --> 00:28:09,553
The dark thoughts
that people think I don't see.

481
00:28:09,555 --> 00:28:13,957
I wish I could be you.

482
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:17,895
As fast as you are,
that is your real power.

483
00:28:17,897 --> 00:28:21,465
Don't let Wells
take that from you.

484
00:28:21,467 --> 00:28:23,701
I don't know

485
00:28:23,703 --> 00:28:26,336
Why he's helping us.

486
00:28:26,338 --> 00:28:30,040
All that matters
is that he is.

487
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:35,713
I can't lose my dad, Joe.

488
00:28:35,715 --> 00:28:37,748
Barr.

489
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:41,051
Barr, come on.

490
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:43,387
Come on.
Come on.

491
00:28:51,697 --> 00:28:55,866
Hi. Iris west, I'm with
Central City picture news.

492
00:28:55,868 --> 00:28:59,470
Thanks.

493
00:28:59,472 --> 00:29:00,537
Champagne, miss?

494
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:05,509
Oh, thank you.

495
00:29:05,511 --> 00:29:08,078
We're almost out
of champagne.

496
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,148
Then the fun's
about to begin.

497
00:29:24,729 --> 00:29:26,597
Oh, Mayor Bellows, hi.

498
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:29,700
- This is a lovely party.
- Thank you.

499
00:29:29,702 --> 00:29:33,804
Welcome, welcome,
Central City's finest.

500
00:29:33,806 --> 00:29:37,407
How about a toast
to Mayor Anthony Bellows?

501
00:29:37,409 --> 00:29:40,878
He doesn't just yell
at his staff, he bellows!

502
00:29:43,749 --> 00:29:47,184
You see what I did there
with the wordplay and the...

503
00:29:47,186 --> 00:29:50,120
- Tough crowd.
- Excuse me.

504
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:51,688
Who are you?

505
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:53,390
How quickly they forget.

506
00:29:53,392 --> 00:29:54,925
James Jesse, your honor,

507
00:29:54,927 --> 00:29:59,663
A.k.a. the Trickster.

508
00:29:59,665 --> 00:30:03,333
And I'm here to relieve you
fine people from all your money.

509
00:30:03,335 --> 00:30:06,136
Because we know
if you're in this room,

510
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:08,639
you've got loads of it.

511
00:30:08,641 --> 00:30:10,174
What makes you think
that anyone in this room

512
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:11,575
Would give you a cent?

513
00:30:11,577 --> 00:30:15,245
Because that champagne
they just slurped down

514
00:30:15,247 --> 00:30:17,514
Like so much fruit punch...

515
00:30:17,516 --> 00:30:20,751
I added a little something
special to it.

516
00:30:20,753 --> 00:30:23,854
Trimethylmercury 32.

517
00:30:23,856 --> 00:30:26,023
Poison.

518
00:30:26,025 --> 00:30:28,859
Without the antidote,
you'll begin to feel the effects

519
00:30:28,861 --> 00:30:30,127
In about, oh, um...

520
00:30:30,129 --> 00:30:31,929
One hour.

521
00:30:31,931 --> 00:30:32,963
One hour.

522
00:30:35,067 --> 00:30:37,434
I remember you.

523
00:30:37,436 --> 00:30:39,803
You got to the party
about an hour early.

524
00:30:39,805 --> 00:30:43,674
I offered you the very first
glass of champagne.

525
00:30:46,145 --> 00:30:50,414
An hour is plenty of time for
all of you to call your bankers

526
00:30:50,416 --> 00:30:53,317
And transfer everything you have
to the account number

527
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:55,252
On the bottom of your glass.

528
00:30:55,254 --> 00:30:58,222
Once my young friend and I
are rich,

529
00:30:58,224 --> 00:30:59,690
You'll get the antidote.

530
00:30:59,692 --> 00:31:02,659
If any of you decide
to call 911 instead,

531
00:31:02,661 --> 00:31:06,897
Well, then we switch
to lead poisoning.

532
00:31:08,968 --> 00:31:10,400
Anything?

533
00:31:10,402 --> 00:31:11,468
I'm scanning all
the traffic cams in the city.

534
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:13,337
- I got nothing.
- Hey, baby.

535
00:31:13,339 --> 00:31:16,206
Iris?

536
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:17,741
What's up?

537
00:31:17,743 --> 00:31:20,444
How many of you feel
the trimethyline 32

538
00:31:20,446 --> 00:31:22,713
Coursing through your veins,
hmm?

539
00:31:22,715 --> 00:31:24,314
That's him.
That's Jesse.

540
00:31:24,316 --> 00:31:26,650
- Cisco, can you ping her phone?
- I'm on it.

541
00:31:26,652 --> 00:31:29,786
Trimethylmercury 32 is a
relatively fast-acting poison.

542
00:31:29,788 --> 00:31:31,021
Is there a cure?

543
00:31:31,023 --> 00:31:32,723
Yes. We can start synthesizing
the antidote right now.

544
00:31:32,725 --> 00:31:34,625
Cisco, where is she?

545
00:31:34,627 --> 00:31:35,859
City hall.

546
00:31:35,861 --> 00:31:37,661
The mayor's having a fund-raiser
there tonight.

547
00:31:37,663 --> 00:31:40,530
Barry, do not underestimate
the Trickster.

548
00:31:43,936 --> 00:31:47,304
Well, hello.

549
00:31:47,306 --> 00:31:49,172
You know,

550
00:31:49,174 --> 00:31:51,508
I've been in prison
for 20 years.

551
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:53,810
Then you'll know the routine
when you get sent back.

552
00:31:55,047 --> 00:31:56,480
Where's Henry Allen?

553
00:31:56,482 --> 00:31:58,482
He's where you'll be soon.

554
00:31:58,484 --> 00:31:59,349
Heaven!

555
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,153
Are you familiar
with the movie <i>speed?</i>

556
00:32:03,155 --> 00:32:04,788
Keanu Reeves, Sandra Bullock?

557
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,857
See, you're the bus,
and that's the bomb.

558
00:32:06,859 --> 00:32:09,159
A kinetic bomb, actually,
and if you go below

559
00:32:09,161 --> 00:32:11,662
600 miles per hour,
it'll explode.

560
00:32:11,664 --> 00:32:14,264
Same thing happens
if you try to remove it.

561
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:17,000
Ooh, it's active.

562
00:32:17,002 --> 00:32:18,602
Run, run, run, run, run.

563
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:25,475
Cisco!

564
00:32:25,477 --> 00:32:26,710
He wasn't lying.

565
00:32:26,712 --> 00:32:28,045
That thing's linked
to a speedometer,

566
00:32:28,047 --> 00:32:30,080
And it will blow
if you stop moving.

567
00:32:30,082 --> 00:32:31,748
I can't run forever.

568
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:34,918
There's gotta be a way to get it
off him without damaging it.

569
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,054
Barry, do you see
any walls nearby?

570
00:32:37,056 --> 00:32:38,322
Why?

571
00:32:38,324 --> 00:32:40,190
Because I need you
to run into one.

572
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:42,793
Or more accurately,
through one.

573
00:32:42,795 --> 00:32:44,328
What?

574
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:47,731
If you vibrate
at the natural frequency of air,

575
00:32:47,733 --> 00:32:50,801
Your body... your cells will be
in a state of excitement

576
00:32:50,803 --> 00:32:54,137
That should allow you
to phase

577
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:55,305
Right through that wall,

578
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:57,574
Leaving the bomb
on the other side.

579
00:32:57,576 --> 00:32:59,910
- Should?
- You can do this.

580
00:32:59,912 --> 00:33:01,211
I believe in you.

581
00:33:01,213 --> 00:33:03,647
- I can't.
- Listen to me, Barry.

582
00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:05,582
Breathe.

583
00:33:05,584 --> 00:33:09,386
Breathe.
Feel the air.

584
00:33:09,388 --> 00:33:12,289
Feel that wind on your face.

585
00:33:12,291 --> 00:33:15,826
Feel the ground,
your feet lifting you up,

586
00:33:15,828 --> 00:33:17,995
Pushing you forward,
and the lightning...

587
00:33:17,997 --> 00:33:22,966
Barry, feel the lightning.

588
00:33:22,968 --> 00:33:24,835
Feel its power.

589
00:33:24,837 --> 00:33:28,839
Its electricity pumping
through your veins,

590
00:33:28,841 --> 00:33:33,777
Crackling through you, traveling
to every nerve in your body,

591
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:35,312
Like a shock.

592
00:33:35,314 --> 00:33:38,015
You're no longer you now.

593
00:33:38,017 --> 00:33:40,717
You're part
of something greater.

594
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:45,389
You're part
of a speed-force.

595
00:33:45,391 --> 00:33:47,591
It's yours.

596
00:33:53,464 --> 00:33:55,732
Now do it.

597
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,917
- Oh!
- Barry?

598
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:16,253
Oh, that felt weird.

599
00:34:16,255 --> 00:34:18,422
Oh.

600
00:34:18,424 --> 00:34:20,323
I'm good.

601
00:34:20,325 --> 00:34:23,260
- Ooh, I like it.
- Look at that.

602
00:34:23,262 --> 00:34:25,962
Lobsters on me, kid.

603
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:36,206
It's okay. You've all been
given an antidote.

604
00:34:36,208 --> 00:34:38,008
That wasn't very sanitary.

605
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:39,209
Now where is Henry Allen?

606
00:34:39,211 --> 00:34:43,246
You're going to prison
either way, James.

607
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:04,134
All right.

608
00:35:13,212 --> 00:35:15,512
You always did look good
in red.

609
00:35:30,428 --> 00:35:32,129
Wow.

610
00:35:32,131 --> 00:35:35,432
Half of this stuff didn't even
exist when I was practicing.

611
00:35:35,434 --> 00:35:37,234
Yeah, well, I'd be happy
to give you

612
00:35:37,236 --> 00:35:41,505
A crash course on all of it
if you get out.

613
00:35:41,507 --> 00:35:42,739
I'm gonna shut up now.

614
00:35:42,741 --> 00:35:44,741
It's okay.

615
00:35:44,743 --> 00:35:46,543
- Dr. Allen?
- Yes?

616
00:35:46,545 --> 00:35:48,044
I'm feeling the need
to give you a hug.

617
00:35:48,046 --> 00:35:52,382
Absolutely.
I will always accept a hug.

618
00:35:52,384 --> 00:35:54,484
Thank you.

619
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:03,460
Wow.
You gotta tell me.

620
00:36:03,462 --> 00:36:05,629
What does it feel like when
you're running down the street

621
00:36:05,631 --> 00:36:08,798
Like a bat out of hell?

622
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:15,539
There's no feeling like it.

623
00:36:15,541 --> 00:36:19,142
I bet.

624
00:36:19,144 --> 00:36:22,546
Actually, you're all heroes
in my book,

625
00:36:22,548 --> 00:36:25,248
Especially you,
Dr. Wells.

626
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:26,883
Thank you

627
00:36:26,885 --> 00:36:28,985
For everything that
you've done for my son.

628
00:36:28,987 --> 00:36:32,422
Well, your son is
an extraordinary man, Dr. Allen,

629
00:36:32,424 --> 00:36:34,391
And I will do everything
in my power

630
00:36:34,393 --> 00:36:37,527
To ensure Barry's future.

631
00:36:53,511 --> 00:36:56,379
It's time, Joe.

632
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:57,380
- No.
- No?

633
00:36:57,382 --> 00:37:00,650
- No.
- Okay.

634
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:08,458
You seem like
you could use a hug too.

635
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:11,261
Your father is
an extraordinary man.

636
00:37:11,263 --> 00:37:15,532
You're lucky to have him.

637
00:37:15,534 --> 00:37:18,134
I'm lucky to have you too.

638
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:34,918
Ahh!

639
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:57,574
Who are you?

640
00:37:57,576 --> 00:37:59,976
My name is Eobard Thawne,

641
00:37:59,978 --> 00:38:02,579
But that name doesn't matter.

642
00:38:02,581 --> 00:38:04,714
Not anymore.
It won't matter for many years.

643
00:38:04,716 --> 00:38:08,518
The only thing that really
matters is who you are.

644
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,120
Harrison Wells.

645
00:38:10,122 --> 00:38:12,122
What are you talking about?
I don't understand.

646
00:38:12,124 --> 00:38:16,726
In the year 2020,
you and your wife, Tess Morgan,

647
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:19,162
Successfully launched

648
00:38:19,164 --> 00:38:20,930
That changed the course
of history.

649
00:38:20,932 --> 00:38:24,134
I need it to happen a bit sooner
if I'm going to get back.

650
00:38:24,136 --> 00:38:27,704
Much sooner.

651
00:38:27,706 --> 00:38:30,340
- What is that?
- My way home.

652
00:38:32,778 --> 00:38:36,946
You see, they're not coming
to save you.

653
00:38:36,948 --> 00:38:41,051
They're coming to save me.

654
00:39:23,728 --> 00:39:25,695
Hey, Joe.

655
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:27,230
Desk sergeant said
you were looking for me.

656
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:29,899
Eddie, yeah.
Uh...

657
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:36,406
Sit down.

658
00:39:36,408 --> 00:39:39,642
It's about Iris.

659
00:39:39,644 --> 00:39:42,145
She's looking into
Mason Bridge's disappearance.

660
00:39:42,147 --> 00:39:44,080
We can't let that happen.

661
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:52,021
Detective.

662
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:10,306
Eddie, we need your help.

663
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:15,912
Brazil?

664
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:20,683
Why... why would
mason move to Brazil?

665
00:40:20,685 --> 00:40:22,952
Apparently there was
a girl involved,

666
00:40:22,954 --> 00:40:27,757
And he decided to go hike
the amazon with her for a year,

667
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:29,459
You know, live off the grid,

668
00:40:29,461 --> 00:40:30,894
Write his memoirs
or something.

669
00:40:30,896 --> 00:40:33,763
Wow. I guess you really
don't know anyone.

670
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:35,765
No, you don't.

671
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:37,066
Hey, baby, everything good?

672
00:40:37,068 --> 00:40:38,768
Yeah, yeah.
Of course.

673
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:41,604
Um, dinner will be ready
in a jiff, okay?

674
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:43,072
Okay.

675
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:50,146
She buy it?

676
00:40:50,148 --> 00:40:52,015
I think so.

677
00:40:52,017 --> 00:40:54,150
Keeping her in the dark,
it's for her safety.

678
00:40:54,152 --> 00:40:57,487
That is debatable,
and we will have that debate.

679
00:40:57,489 --> 00:41:00,623
But for right now,
what's our next move?

680
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:03,560
How do we figure out
what Wells is up to?

681
00:41:03,562 --> 00:41:07,997
When Wells was talking me
through phasing

682
00:41:07,999 --> 00:41:10,567
So I could get the Trickster's
bomb off my wrist,

683
00:41:10,569 --> 00:41:14,804
The way that he described
my being the Flash, running,

684
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:19,776
Feeling the wind
and the power,

685
00:41:19,778 --> 00:41:23,446
It's like he was talking
from experience.

686
00:41:23,448 --> 00:41:24,681
What are you saying?

687
00:41:24,683 --> 00:41:26,316
I don't know how...

688
00:41:26,318 --> 00:41:29,052
But he's the man in yellow.

689
00:41:29,054 --> 00:41:32,555
Harrison Wells
is the Reverse-Flash.

690
00:41:36,527 --> 00:41:38,528
I got an 11-80,
possible 10-54,

691
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:41,431
County road J,
requesting immediate assistance.

692
00:41:41,433 --> 00:41:44,567
Copy that.
Units en route to your location.

693
00:41:47,072 --> 00:41:49,172
Sir, we're gonna get you
out of here.

694
00:41:49,174 --> 00:41:50,540
Can you tell me your name?

695
00:41:50,542 --> 00:41:54,277
Do you know who you are?

696
00:41:54,279 --> 00:41:56,713
My name...

697
00:41:56,715 --> 00:41:59,616
Is...

698
00:41:59,618 --> 00:42:03,386
Harrison Wells.

699
00:42:25,976 --> 00:42:27,577
Greg, move your head.
