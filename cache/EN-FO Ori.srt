01:23:49,566 --> 01:23:51,483
Captain Armando...

2
01:23:52,027 --> 01:23:55,029
told me you know the Tuichi River
better than anyone.

3
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:56,155
told me you know the Tuichi River
better than anyone.

4
01:23:57,365 --> 01:23:59,158
I have a friend...

5
01:23:59,284 --> 01:24:01,702
who is lost on the river.

6
01:24:02,579 --> 01:24:04,663
The missing one?

7
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:08,125
A gringo lost 17 days in the jung!e?

8
01:24:08,752 --> 01:24:10,169
He doesn't stand a chance.

9
01:24:10,545 --> 01:24:12,880
Your friend is having a drink with...

10
01:24:13,256 --> 01:24:14,465
the A!mighty up there.

11
01:24:15,508 --> 01:24:17,801
My friend is alive...

12
01:24:18,386 --> 01:24:22,097
and! need you to help me find him.

13
01:24:25,143 --> 01:24:26,518
No, not me.

14
01:24:27,228 --> 01:24:30,481
I've never begged for anything...

15
01:24:31,357 --> 01:24:34,693
But!'m begging you now...
please.

16
01:24:44,287 --> 01:24:46,121
How much for your boat?

17
01:28:45,987 --> 01:28:47,779
No, no, no. You can't eat that!

18
01:28:47,864 --> 01:28:50,866
No, don't eat, no, no.
You can't eat that!

19
01:28:50,867 --> 01:28:53,035
No, don't eat, no, no.
You can't eat that!

20
01:40:59,219 --> 01:41:00,553
What's going on?

21
01:41:00,846 --> 01:41:02,180
We have to head back...

22
01:41:02,389 --> 01:41:03,848
It's impossib!e.

23
01:41:12,316 --> 01:41:13,900
You did everything you cou!d.
