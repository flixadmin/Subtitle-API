ORIGINAL STORY SWEET HOME
BY CARNBY KIM AND YOUNGCHAN HWANG

2
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,765
LAST WORLD FAN FESTIVAL
VIP TESTER EVENT

3
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:58,725
APPLY

4
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:00,351
YOU HAVE APPLIED AS A VIP TESTER

5
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:02,979
Hyun-su, how long are you
going to behave like that?

6
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,857
-What?
-Honey.

7
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,485
Dad, why are you ruining the mood?

8
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,987
Then when else would I be
able to talk to him?

9
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,655
He never leaves his room.

10
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,949
Why are you ruining your own life?

11
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:17,327
Stop it. This is a family trip.

12
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,120
Hyun-su came out to join us.

13
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:20,121
So what?

14
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:21,748
Should I be impressed?

15
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:25,835
Fuck.

16
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:28,004
What?

17
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,339
You make me sick.

18
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:33,593
I'm so grateful you earn money for us
just to neglect your own son.

19
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,429
-You little brat.
-Hey, what's wrong with you?

20
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,640
Shut up, Su-a.
You're ashamed of me, aren't you?

21
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:42,227
Are you scared you'll end up like me?
I heard you talking shit with your friend.

22
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,938
-That's…
-Hyun-su, calm down.

23
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:47,607
You're no different, Mom.

24
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:51,986
You suggested it.
Did you think I wouldn't know?

25
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,530
Hyun-su…

26
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:56,950
I thought you were strong enough
to overcome it.

27
00:01:57,033 --> 00:02:00,036
I'm not! How could I?

28
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,871
Cha Hyun-su! You brat!

29
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,414
You should all just die.

30
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:04,958
Dad!

31
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,108
He's awake! Hyun-su's awake!

32
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:35,905
I didn't think you'd wake up.

33
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:40,034
How long was I unconscious?

34
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:40,952
A pretty long time.

35
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:44,914
I had a dream…

36
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:48,293
A dream? What dream?

37
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:51,963
I can't remember it now.

38
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:55,133
I heard somebody was moving
into Room 1410. I guess that's you.

39
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:56,259
-Living alone?
-A loner?

40
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:58,678
You'll just cause trouble…
Find somewhere else to die.

41
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:01,264
A slow speaker.

42
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:05,059
-I'll protect you.
-Protect them?

43
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,644
Is that what you want?

44
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:08,771
That's what dreams are like.

45
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:09,814
Uncle…

46
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,942
I want to be alone for a while.

47
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,195
All right. Call me if you need any help.

48
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,405
You should live a decent life now.

49
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:21,492
At least for your dead family.

50
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,581
I'm sure there's a reason
you're the only one who survived.

51
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:37,300
Did I have an uncle?

52
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:03,368
Isn't it cool?

53
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:07,997
It's what you wanted. You wanted
everyone in the world to disappear.

54
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,083
-You should all just die.
-"You should all just die."

55
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:13,711
I can make everyone you hate disappear.

56
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,380
And I can do even more than that.

57
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:17,590
I am you.
All you have to do is accept that.

58
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,763
Sir, what's wrong?

59
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,649
Yeong-su, pull!

60
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,362
Wake up!

61
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:42,407
Come on!

62
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:58,756
Did you hear that?

63
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:00,508
Yes.

64
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,260
It's pretty loud.

65
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,306
Maybe it's the guy we saw.

66
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:08,808
What's God's will?

67
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:13,146
I'm sure it isn't to be selfish
and ignore others.

68
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:22,905
Run!

69
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:25,908
Hurry!

70
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,246
Are you okay?

71
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,376
Who are…

72
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,589
The kids.

73
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:23,299
What about the kids?

74
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:28,054
You're infected, aren't you?

75
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:29,806
Your nose was bleeding and you fainted!

76
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,558
-You're the one who wanted to save him.
-Are you sure he won't turn?

77
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,894
I'm sure crushing his head in right now

78
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,439
is not the will of God.

79
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:49,784
Help me.

80
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:55,373
Please help me.

81
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:56,999
I made a promise.

82
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:00,586
Help me.

83
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:03,256
Please.

84
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:52,054
Su-yeong, is he not coming back?

85
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,723
Is he dead?

86
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:59,729
We have to go on our own.

87
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,106
But…

88
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,450
It's okay. I won't tell anyone.

89
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:15,953
Let's go.

90
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:24,378
I…

91
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:28,382
can't see.

92
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,809
Where are you?

93
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,529
I think I should tell you in advance.

94
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,324
They're not infected.

95
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,285
There aren't any monsters around here.

96
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,079
Let's go.

97
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:04,669
I can't see!

98
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:07,338
You might meet a monster that can't see.

99
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:08,631
His hearing is really good.

100
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,514
Don't make any noise.

101
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,893
And don't move.

102
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:23,104
I can't see…

103
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:38,536
I can't see…

104
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,940
I found you.

105
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:28,377
No!

106
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:42,391
Su-yeong, he told us

107
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:45,186
that it was Room 1408.

108
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:48,230
This is the 15th floor, though.

109
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:51,901
We can't go there now.

110
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,903
The monsters are fighting there.

111
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:55,946
Su-yeong…

112
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,533
There might be some grown-ups
who can help us.

113
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:11,921
Hello? Is there anyone in there?

114
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,381
Please help us!

115
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:21,514
Help us!

116
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:45,746
Close your eyes.

117
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,415
Su-yeong…

118
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:50,167
I said to close your eyes, Kim Yeong-su!

119
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:06,994
I'LL SEE YOU AGAIN, ASSHOLE

120
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,498
PRESIDENT'S EMERGENCY STATEMENT

121
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,082
My fellow citizens,

122
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:17,421
we are declaring a state of emergency.

123
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,761
Do not leave your homes.

124
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:31,936
The monsters are extremely dangerous.

125
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,605
Don't touch the children.

126
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,777
You can do that, right?

127
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:46,492
The government will prioritize
the citizens' safety…

128
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,328
and…

129
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:54,708
What?

130
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,673
As if! Shit!

131
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,760
Everyone is going to die.
You're all fucked!

132
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:13,352
You're going to die.

133
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:15,729
Die!

134
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,530
What?

135
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:27,992
Is the president dead?

136
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:31,662
Gosh. I voted for him.

137
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:34,498
But still, they'll come and save us.

138
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:35,958
Are you deaf?

139
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,501
He just said we're all fucked!

140
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:49,430
-What's wrong with him?
-Seung-wan, what's wrong?

141
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,140
My poor daughter…

142
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,809
No…

143
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:12,870
Da-eun…

144
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:23,464
Da-eun…

145
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:37,770
Da-eun…

146
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,202
No…

147
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:58,749
No!

148
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,837
Da-eun…

149
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,134
Da-eun?

150
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,698
To be honest,

151
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:34,118
I already knew.

152
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,211
I knew…

153
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:49,967
that my baby was gone.

154
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,067
Kids, run.

155
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:09,778
Hurry!

156
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,115
Come on.

157
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:28,922
How do we kill that thing?

158
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,276
Take the kids and run!

159
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:54,448
Come to Room 1408!

160
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,001
Ji-su,

161
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,129
I'll take care of this.

162
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:16,261
Even those great muscles…

163
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:21,642
can't compete with this, I guess.

164
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,229
You're lousier than I thought.

165
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:26,355
He'll kill you.

166
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:27,606
Right? You piece of meat.

167
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:32,277
All right, that's it.

168
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:42,621
Ma'am, are you okay?

169
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,404
What about the kids?

170
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:33,315
There's no greater love than laying down
one's life for their friends.

171
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,734
If you do as God commands, you're…

172
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,695
His friend.

173
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,549
Amen.

174
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:24,825
They're safe.

175
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:45,887
I can go by myself from here.

176
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,435
Make sure to come, okay?

177
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:55,689
Okay.

178
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:57,816
I'll see you in Room 1408.

179
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:53,288
Who are you?

180
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:14,142
Ji-su.

181
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:16,686
I'm glad you're okay.

182
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,146
Do you want to die that badly?

183
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:22,692
I get that you like God,

184
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:25,987
but you can go meet him later.

185
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:30,325
God is omnipresent.

186
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,001
-Come on!
-Okay.

187
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:52,222
Ji-su, wait.

188
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:53,640
Someone must have been here.

189
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:03,859
You're pretty rude sometimes.

190
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,781
You're the first one to visit my room.

191
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:12,701
Oh, is your room usually…

192
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:15,996
It's not usually this bad.

193
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:18,123
Okay.

194
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,517
Ji-su.

195
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,644
Aren't you going to take that?

196
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:55,243
NOW IT'S YOURS

197
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:19,768
This is yours, right?

198
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,191
Hey, you got the job!

199
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:27,651
Congrats…

200
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,869
This is all useless, Mom.

201
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:41,498
I've studied so hard for five years,

202
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,584
but the world is over now.

203
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,712
The president's death
doesn't mean it's over.

204
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:51,007
We don't know that.
You're jumping to conclusions.

205
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:05,105
As if! Shit!

206
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:09,484
Everyone is going to die.
You're all fucked!

207
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:13,405
-Ma'am, turn that off, will you?
-You're going to die. Die!

208
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,448
It's getting on my nerves.

209
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:16,741
Stop calling me "ma'am."

210
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:19,911
You're such an asshole.

211
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,622
"Asshole"? Right…

212
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:32,465
Have you seen my sister?

213
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:35,010
Eun-yu?
I haven't seen her for a while now.

214
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,469
Weren't you with her?

215
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:38,471
No.

216
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,808
I guess he was pretty flustered, too.

217
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:43,893
He doesn't even know where his sister is.

218
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:47,272
Bom, I promise I'll never leave your side.

219
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:08,121
Come and sit.

220
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:13,251
Okay.

221
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:22,802
Enjoy.

222
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:26,806
Let's eat.

223
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:42,697
Kids,

224
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,241
what are your names?

225
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:50,580
I'm Kim Yeong-su.

226
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:53,666
I'm Kim Su-yeong.

227
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:56,294
Kim Yeong-su and Kim Su-yeong.

228
00:29:58,254 --> 00:30:00,590
Yeong-su and Su-yeong…

229
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:02,967
They're peculiar names…

230
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:12,185
I guess your parents
gave you similar names,

231
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:14,145
so you two would always stick together.

232
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:16,689
Yeong-su and Su-yeong. Right?

233
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,652
Dad named us…

234
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:23,863
Dad…

235
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:42,340
Thank you.

236
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:53,935
It's all right. I don't really drink.

237
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:06,072
You sure know how to drink.

238
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:09,868
-Here, you can have one, too.
-Oh, I'm…

239
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,579
Oh, right. You're a minor.

240
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:15,206
Right. There are kids here,

241
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:18,585
so let's not break the law. I'll buy you
a drink when you become an adult.

242
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:20,461
You should learn how to drink from adults.

243
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:23,798
Do you think…

244
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:26,509
that day will come?

245
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:42,627
ELECTRICAL ROOM

246
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:52,637
The electricity's back on,
but why hasn't she returned yet?

247
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:57,517
Isn't there a security camera
in the basement?

248
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,229
The camera's been turned like that.

249
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:09,862
I told her it was too dangerous.

250
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:11,614
Didn't I tell her, Bom?

251
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,993
Let's wait a bit longer.

252
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:41,436
Hey, it's your turn.

253
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:45,064
-What?
-It's your turn to stand watch.

254
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,162
I'm infected.

255
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:02,123
I know.

256
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:04,625
If I turn,

257
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:05,918
kill me.

258
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:11,799
Sorry.

259
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:15,053
What?

260
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:18,765
If I turn…

261
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:24,771
kill me and I'll do the same for you.

262
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:26,898
Okay?

263
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:30,860
Okay.

264
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:56,677
This is so selfish!

265
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:58,805
GREEN SUPERMARKET

266
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,058
Hang on.

267
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:03,476
Seok-hyeon, it's me, Byeong-il.

268
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:07,730
You shouldn't do this to me!

269
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,524
I'm not running a charity here.

270
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:11,859
Bring money if you want something!

271
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,528
This is insane.

272
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:16,614
What…

273
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,244
GREEN SUPERMARKET

274
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:25,289
Who is he?

275
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:27,875
You're Room 802, right?

276
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,962
What happened to your face?
I couldn't recognize you.

277
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:32,547
Were you here the whole time?

278
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:36,926
No, I came down earlier tonight.

279
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:38,302
Tonight?

280
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:41,764
Your face looks awful.
Did something happen on the way down?

281
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,266
Oh, this?

282
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,227
I got hurt a while ago.

283
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,520
A burglar broke into my house.

284
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:49,230
-A burglar?
-A burglar?

285
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:50,773
A burglar in this building?

286
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:54,610
What's he doing?

287
00:35:57,363 --> 00:35:59,407
-My goodness.
-There's food!

288
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:02,118
We can share.

289
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:04,328
Thank you so much.

290
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:06,664
Take this.

291
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:15,673
-I'm sure you'll be blessed.
-We should all help each other, right?

292
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:18,009
-Thank you.
-I got this, too.

293
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:21,095
Thank you. We're saved now.

294
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,263
Here.

295
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:28,477
Take this.

296
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:32,565
It's all right.

297
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,281
Take as much as you want.

298
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:41,616
Thank you.

299
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:47,997
Help yourself.

300
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:01,260
What are you doing?

301
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,597
I've been watching since dawn.

302
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:06,349
I think it's safe outside.

303
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,725
All the monsters are gone.

304
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:11,354
You're thinking of going out?

305
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,940
Do you want to die in here, then?

306
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:17,693
-If I can get to the car…
-Then take me, too!

307
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:20,238
My mom lives in Wangsimni.
Please just take me there.

308
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:21,989
I'll have to take a detour if--

309
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:23,241
Please.

310
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:25,284
-It's too far.
-Please. Come on.

311
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:28,037
Is it nice to eat free food like a beggar?

312
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:30,373
You could've given me some food, too.

313
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:32,583
Buy some with your money!

314
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:35,670
How can you treat me like this?

315
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:39,507
What's this sound?

316
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:06,450
Tell them to turn it off!

317
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:09,745
They turn it on every morning.
You used to dance to it.

318
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:13,582
Hey, don't you remember that monster
with the tongue?

319
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:16,294
It's going to hear that
and come back here!

320
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:19,255
Gosh, you startled me.

321
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:21,716
How can it hear that and come here?
That's ridiculous.

322
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:24,218
Do you think it only has a tongue?
It has ears, too!

323
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:27,680
It must have ears! It's going to hear it!
Tell them to stop that!

324
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:58,627
Survivors in the building,

325
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:03,090
take any food, medicine, and weapons
you have and come to the first floor.

326
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:05,551
The first floor is quite safe for now,

327
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,179
and it'll be safer to stay together.

328
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:14,352
We survivors…

329
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:17,938
must stick together.

330
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:26,113
Please come down.

331
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:31,952
Please.

332
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:37,583
I repeat--

333
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:55,684
-What's wrong with you?
-What are you doing?

334
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:58,354
-My daughter!
-Hold her!

335
00:39:58,437 --> 00:40:00,189
-Let me go!
-Why are you doing this?

336
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:01,941
-What's going on?
