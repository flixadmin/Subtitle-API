1
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:55,407
Jaime: I made a deal for you,

2
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,452
to keep your ungrateful head
on your neck a little while longer.

3
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:00,215
Tyrion: I'm sorry, what am I grateful for?

4
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:04,207
The opportunity to live and die at the wall
as punishment for a crime I did not commit?

5
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,418
You threw your life away.

6
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:08,688
It's not a joke.
You understand that, don't you?

7
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:11,882
Of course it's a joke,
just not a very funny one.

8
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:20,641
I couldn't listen to her
standing there, telling her lies.

9
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:22,517
I couldn't do it.

10
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:24,978
You fell in love with a whore.

11
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:27,606
Yes.

12
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:30,609
And I was stupid enough to think
that she had fallen in love with me.

13
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,116
That deal you made,

14
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,993
it was everything father wanted.

15
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:43,830
You do see that? He
gets you back as his heir.

16
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:45,999
The future lord of the rock.

17
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:49,753
And he ships me off to castle black,
out of sight at last.

18
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,173
All so perfect.

19
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:58,345
It felt good to take that from him.

20
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,850
He knows I'm innocent
and he's willing to sacrifice me anyway.

21
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:05,119
He's willing to sacrifice any of us.

22
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,144
Not you.

23
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:09,481
You're the golden son.

24
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,650
You could kill a king, lose a hand,

25
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,902
fuck your own sister,
you'll always be the golden son.

26
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:15,237
Careful.

27
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:18,281
I'm the last friend you've got.

28
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,955
At least I got to tell
them what they really are.

29
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,957
Yes, brilliant speech.

30
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:29,543
They'll be talking about
it for days to come.

31
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,878
I thought you were a realist.

32
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,798
Didn't realise you'd die for pride.

33
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,092
Don't give up on me just yet.

34
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:42,013
I survived one trial by combat,
even though you weren't there to save me.

35
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:44,266
I can't save you this time either.

36
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:50,564
My training has proved that I can't
beat a stable boy with my left hand.

37
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,651
Where's your sense of adventure?

38
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:58,739
Even if you lose, imagine the look
on father's face when you fall.

39
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:03,410
Our family name snuffed out
with a single swing of the sword.

40
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,037
It is tempting.

41
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,764
Well...

42
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:26,641
Bronn fought for me
once, he'll do it again.

43
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:30,020
If he wins,

44
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,564
I expect I'll be in his debt
for the rest of my life.

45
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:34,524
If he wins.

46
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:36,526
Will you find him for me?

47
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,657
Who does Cersei plan
on naming as a champion?

48
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:45,368
I hope it's ser meryn trant.

49
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:48,830
I'd enjoy watching bronn
disembowel that pompous child beater.

50
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,627
Not ser meryn.

51
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:05,055
Guard: Go on, move it.

52
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,307
And you.

53
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,184
Come on.

54
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:19,820
Mercy.

55
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:22,906
Please.

56
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,741
Please, mercy.

57
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,670
Cersei: Ser Gregor.

58
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,380
Welcome to the capital.

59
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:42,759
Thank you for riding here so quickly.

60
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:48,098
You seem to be in good form.

61
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:50,267
Who am I fighting?

62
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:52,644
Does it matter?

63
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:17,794
Could be food.

64
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,046
Could be soldiers.

65
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:47,699
You shouldn't be
sitting out here like this.

66
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,618
Where else to sit?

67
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,954
Tried to walk back to me hut,

68
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:54,539
hurt too much.

69
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:58,001
Then I remembered they burned me hut down.

70
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,378
Who were "they"?

71
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:02,672
I stopped asking a while ago.

72
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:09,471
That's not going to get better.

73
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:10,972
Doesn't seem so.

74
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:12,807
A bad way to go.

75
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,519
Haven't you had enough?

76
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,146
Of what?

77
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,026
I know.

78
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:25,362
Time to go.

79
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:28,531
Take matters into me own hands.

80
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,869
The thought has occurred to me.

81
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:38,667
So why go on?

82
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:41,086
Habit.

83
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,424
Nothing could be worse than this.

84
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:49,552
Maybe nothing is worse than this.

85
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:55,392
Nothing isn't better
or worse than anything.

86
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,438
Nothing is just nothing.

87
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:06,695
Who are you?

88
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,825
My name is Arya.

89
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,243
Arya stark.

90
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:17,747
You her father?

91
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:20,750
Her captor.

92
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,753
Bringing her to her aunt for ransom.

93
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:27,549
A fair exchange, that is.

94
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:34,806
Always held to the notion of fair exchange
in all my dealings.

95
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:39,102
You give me, I give you.

96
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:41,688
Fair.

97
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,399
A balance.

98
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,945
No balance any more.

99
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,703
Could I have a drink?

100
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,913
Dying is thirsty work.

101
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:10,675
Wish it were wine.

102
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,303
So do I.

103
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:35,200
That's where the heart is.

104
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,038
That's how you kill a man.

105
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:49,672
The fuck you doing?

106
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,593
There's a price on your head.

107
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:56,513
Guess that's what the king does
when you tell him to fuck off.

108
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,014
The king's dead.

109
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:01,184
He drank poisoned wine at his own wedding.

110
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:04,062
The bounty on you
is for killing Lannister soldiers.

111
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,605
A hundred silver stags.

112
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,607
And you thought you
were going to collect it?

113
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:11,027
Didn't think very hard, did you?

114
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:13,613
You were yoren's prisoners
when he was taking me to the wall.

115
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,826
He told me he'd fuck
me bloody with a stick.

116
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:21,412
This day's really not working out
the way you planned.

117
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,623
He on your little list?

118
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:25,625
He can't be.

119
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,753
I don't know his name.

120
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,131
What's your name?

121
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,634
- Rorge.
- Thank you.

122
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,143
You're learning.

123
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:52,402
Man: Rangers returning!

124
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:55,780
Man: They return!

125
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:59,325
- Rangers returning!
- Greetings.

126
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:01,161
Man: Didn't think I'd see you again.

127
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:02,453
All right, Jon?

128
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:03,580
Welcome back, brother.

129
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:14,591
Lord snow.

130
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,349
This is no place for wild beasts.
Lock him away,

131
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,936
or I'll let hobb throw
him in tonight's stew.

132
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,908
Come on, ghost.

133
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:46,581
Mance's army was closing in
on craster's keep when we left.

134
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,833
We saw their campfires from osric's hill.

135
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:50,769
They'll reach the wall
before the next full moon.

136
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:53,379
I'm surprised you didn't ride over
and say hello.

137
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:55,482
The king-beyond-the-wall
is your old friend, isn't he?

138
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:56,841
We need to prepare.

139
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:58,259
We've been preparing.

140
00:11:58,343 --> 00:11:59,677
We should seal the tunnel.

141
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:04,140
Plug it with rocks and ice.
Flood it and let it freeze.

142
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:06,184
Alliser: And how would we range north?

143
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:07,977
- We wouldn't.
- Man: Coward!

144
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,648
You would cut off our legs,
pluck out our eyes,

145
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:15,360
leave us cowering behind the wall
hoping for the storm to pass?

146
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:18,154
We can't defend the
gate against 100,000 men.

147
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,990
This castle has stood
for thousands of years.

148
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:24,077
The night's watch has defended her
for thousands of years.

149
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,121
And in all those centuries,
we have never sealed the tunnel.

150
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:29,415
Have you ever seen a giant, ser alliser?

151
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:31,626
I have.

152
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,419
The tunnel's gate won't stop them.

153
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:35,922
The bars on those gates
are four inches thick.

154
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,465
Cold-rolled steel.

155
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:39,509
And they won't stop them.

156
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:44,013
Remind me which order you belong to,
lord snow.

157
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:45,806
The stewards.

158
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:48,935
Are the stewards responsible
for maintaining the tunnel?

159
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:52,897
Who would that be?

160
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,985
- The builders.
- Ah, the builders.

161
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,195
First builder yannyck,

162
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:02,782
lord snow here recommends
sealing the tunnel,

163
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:07,620
leaving us unable to carry out our duties
as sworn brothers of the night's watch.

164
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:09,956
Do you agree with him?

165
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:24,804
Alliser: Given your deep knowledge
of the wildling army, lord snow,

166
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:29,934
you and tarly will take night duties
atop the wall until the full moon.

167
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,397
Moving on.

168
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,067
First builder, we'll need 100
barrels of pitch brought atop the wall.

169
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,152
Yarwyck: Aye.

170
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:04,927
My lord.

171
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,182
You have new clothes.

172
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:11,100
Do you like 'em? Eh?

173
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:14,937
Gloves are doeskin.

174
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:16,356
Softer than a virgin's thighs.

175
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:18,232
I sent for you days ago.

176
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:20,485
- I've been a bit busy.
- Doing what?

177
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:26,115
My lonesome bachelor days are over.

178
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:29,952
I'm to wed lollys stokeworth.

179
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:33,539
Lollys stokeworth?

180
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:37,251
She doesn't strike me as your sort of girl.

181
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:40,046
I wouldn't say I had a single sort of girl.

182
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,506
She's dim-witted.

183
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,341
If I wanted wits, I'd marry you.

184
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:46,135
When my sister arranged this love match,

185
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:49,263
did she mention
that lollys has an older sister?

186
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,057
Falyse.

187
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,725
Aye, I did know.

188
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:54,644
And you understand
the rules of inheritance?

189
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,187
Falyse is 40 and barren.

190
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:59,690
She still gets castle stokeworth
when her father dies.

191
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:01,025
She does.

192
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:03,611
Unless she happens to perish
before her father.

193
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:05,822
Then lollys gets the castle.

194
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:11,619
What? Ladies fall from their horses
and snap their pretty necks all the time.

195
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:14,080
You and my sister deserve each other.

196
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:17,166
Why did you bother to come here?

197
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:28,261
You once said if anyone ever asked me
to sell you out, you'd double their price.

198
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,221
Is it two wives you want or two castles?

199
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:31,305
One of each will do.

200
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:36,227
But if you want me
to kill the mountain for you,

201
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,770
it'd better be a damn big castle.

202
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:41,899
I'm a bit short on castles at the moment.
But I can offer you gold and gratitude.

203
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:43,776
I have gold.

204
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,111
What can I buy with gratitude?

205
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,196
You might be surprised.

206
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,615
A Lannister always pays his debts.

207
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:51,033
Your sister's a Lannister, too.

208
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:53,286
My wife is heir to winterfell.

209
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:57,498
If I emerge from this
with my head still on my shoulders,

210
00:15:57,582 --> 00:16:00,543
I may one day rule the north in her name.

211
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,796
I could carve you out a big piece of it.

212
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:05,798
If and may and could.

213
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,676
It's bloody cold up north.

214
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:11,637
Lollys is soft and warm. And close.

215
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:16,476
If I gave you the choice between
fucking lollys and fighting the mountain,

216
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:19,279
you'd have your britches down
and your cock out before I could blink.

217
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:20,563
Does he frighten you so much?

218
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,940
I'd be a bloody fool if
he didn't frighten me.

219
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:25,318
He's freakish big and strong.

220
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,487
And quicker than you'd expect
for a man of that size.

221
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:31,240
Maybe I could take him,

222
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:34,327
dance around
until he's so tired of hacking at me,

223
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,663
he dropped his sword,
get him off his feet somehow.

224
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:39,832
But one misstep

225
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,375
and I'm dead.

226
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,878
Why should I risk it?

227
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:45,922
Because you're my friend.

228
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:47,965
Aye, I'm your friend.

229
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:51,302
And when have you ever risked your life
for me?

230
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,314
I like you,

231
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,566
pampered little shit that you are.

232
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,026
I just like myself more.

233
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:08,945
I understand.

234
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:10,530
I'm sorry it has to be this way.

235
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:12,281
Why are you sorry?

236
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:16,285
Because you're an evil bastard
with no conscience and no heart?

237
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:20,122
That's what I liked about
you in the first place.

238
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,588
We had some good days together.

239
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:29,298
Yes, we did.

240
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:45,606
What will you do?

241
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:49,068
I suppose I'll have to
kill the mountain myself.

242
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,656
Won't that make for a great song?

243
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:59,495
I hope to hear them sing it one day.

244
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:18,848
How did you get in here?

245
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,516
Your door is well guarded,

246
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,476
but your window is not.

247
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:32,069
I swam to an island a
mile offshore for these.

248
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,114
Don't do that again.

249
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:39,201
Never met a woman
who didn't like wildflowers.

250
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:41,120
These are my private quarters.

251
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:43,539
If I want you here, I will summon you.

252
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,960
Forgive me, my queen. I live to serve you.

253
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:56,552
Tell me why you're here.

254
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,390
I came to ask a favour.

255
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:05,478
I only have two talents in this world.

256
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,063
War and women.

257
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:11,817
You are staying here in meereen to rule.
That is a wise decision. I respect it.

258
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:14,070
But here in meereen,
I cannot pursue my talents.

259
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:17,698
I've ordered the second sons to patrol
the streets to stop the revenge killings.

260
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,384
You've ordered us to be night watchmen.

261
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,744
And as for women,

262
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:25,164
there are thousands in meereen
you can pursue.

263
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,958
There is only one,

264
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,503
and she does not want me.

265
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:33,547
You swore me your sword.

266
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:36,008
My sword is yours till the day I die.

267
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:39,720
So if I command you to stay in meereen
and patrol the streets?

268
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:42,723
I'll stay in meereen
and patrol the streets.

269
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:45,226
Send me to kill your enemies.

270
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,269
Any enemy anywhere.

271
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,856
Let me do what I do best.

272
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:54,110
Very well.

273
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:02,326
Do what you do best.

274
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:15,464
Take off your clothes.

275
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,498
Come in, my queen. Please.

276
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:51,417
I didn't mean to disturb you, my lady.

277
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,793
You could never.

278
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:54,962
I just wanted to speak
with you before we left.

279
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:57,772
Could you bring me that vial over there?

280
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:02,386
The blue one.

281
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:07,016
No, not that one.

282
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,393
You don't even want to touch that one.

283
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,020
Next to it.

284
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:14,064
That's the one.

285
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:36,629
When I looked into the flames this morning,
the lord spoke to me.

286
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,839
Hesam,

287
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:43,844
"tonight, you will have your last good bath
in a long while.

288
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:45,554
"Make it count."

289
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,018
A joke.

290
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,646
Not a very good one, I'm afraid.

291
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:54,772
It was. I...

292
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:58,359
Humour isn't my strength.

293
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:02,530
That's because mostjokes are lies
and you're devoted to the truth.

294
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:05,950
If they're lies, my lady,
aren't they best avoided?

295
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,701
Not always.

296
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:20,714
Most of these powders and potions

297
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:21,799
are lies.

298
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:25,928
Deceptions to make men think
they witnessed our lord's power.

299
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:30,349
Once they step into his light,
they will see the lie for what it was,

300
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:32,935
a trick that led them to the truth.

301
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,521
A pinch of this powder in a bonfire

302
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:39,149
will send a flaming column
screaming towards the sky.

303
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:42,152
And this one creates a black smoke

304
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:44,446
that will make the bravest man
piss himself with fear.

305
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:49,952
And a drop of this in any man's wine
will drive him wild with lust.

306
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,708
Did you use it with Stannis?

307
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:01,839
Don't be upset.

308
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:04,300
Men never crave what they already have.

309
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:07,636
It's only flesh.

310
00:23:09,263 --> 00:23:11,056
It needs what it needs.

311
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:19,690
No act done in service of the lord
can ever be called a sin.

312
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:24,069
I thank god every day
for bringing you to us.

313
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:25,905
And Stannis to you.

314
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:30,367
He wants to bring shireen with us.

315
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:34,496
I think that would be ill-advised.

316
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:39,335
My daughter has heretical tendencies,
as you're well aware.

317
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:42,713
I don't know if her doubt is real
or simply meant to spite me,

318
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:45,883
but whichever the case,
she should stay home.

319
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:53,015
I understand how you feel.

320
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:56,185
But that is impossible.

321
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:05,486
You don't need powders and potions,
my queen.

322
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,947
You don't need lies.

323
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:12,910
You are strong enough to look into the
lord's light and see his truth for yourself.

324
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:20,960
However harsh it is.

325
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:23,462
However hard for us to understand.

326
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:28,050
You don't need my help,
but I will need yours soon.

327
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:32,429
When we set sail,
your daughter must be with us.

328
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:37,935
The lord needs her.

329
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:47,861
Jorah the andal.

330
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:51,573
Are you here to see our queen?

331
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:55,035
She's in a good mood.

332
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,760
Khaleesi.

333
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:13,971
- You're here early.
- Later than some.

334
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,184
- You don't approve?
- It's not a question of approval,

335
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:20,769
it's a question of trust.

336
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:22,521
You neither approve nor trust.

337
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:24,398
Why would I? The man's a sellsword.

338
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:27,985
Didn't you fight for the golden company
before pledging your sword to my brother?

339
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:29,570
I did.

340
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:30,779
I trust you.

341
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:33,365
Daario naharis killed his captains

342
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:36,702
and dumped their heads at your feet
when he grew tired of their commands.

343
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,705
How could you ever have faith
in a man like that?

344
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:42,124
I could never have
faith in a man like daario.

345
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:46,608
That's why I've sent him and
the second sons to retake yunkai.

346
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,841
- You have?
- I have.

347
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:52,885
Without you there to rule, khaleesi,

348
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:55,220
I fear the masters will
simply bide their time,

349
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:57,556
wait for the invaders to leave
and reassert control.

350
00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:01,393
That is why I've ordered daario
to execute every master in yunkai.

351
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:05,689
The masters tear babies
from their mothers' arms.

352
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:08,150
They mutilate little boys by the thousands.

353
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,652
They train little girls
in the art of pleasuring old men.

354
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:13,697
They treat men like beasts,
as you said yourself.

355
00:26:13,781 --> 00:26:17,159
Herding the masters into pens
and slaughtering them by the thousands

356
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,328
is also treating men like beasts.

357
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:23,749
The slaves you freed,
brutality is all they've ever known.

358
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:25,432
If you want them to know something else,

359
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:27,086
you'll have to show it to them.

360
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:30,923
And repay the slavers with what? Kindness?
A fine? A stern warning?

361
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:33,759
It's tempting to see
your enemies as evil, all of them,

362
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:36,470
but there's good and evil
on both sides in every war ever fought.

363
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:39,223
Let the priests argue over good and evil.

364
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:41,016
Slavery is real.

365
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,935
I can end it. I will end it,

366
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:45,395
and those behind it.

367
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:47,940
I sold men into slavery, khaleesi.

368
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:53,237
And now you are helping me
show them to freedom.

369
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,739
I wouldn't be here to help you
if ned stark had done to me

370
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:58,575
what you want to do to
the masters of yunkai.

371
00:27:03,664 --> 00:27:06,208
The man who came to me the other day
about burying his father.

372
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,669
Hizdahr zo loraq?

373
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:13,465
He will accompany the second sons
and serve as my ambassador to yunkai.

374
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:16,301
He will tell the masters
what has happened in meereen.

375
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:19,888
He will explain
the choice they have before them.

376
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:24,768
They can live in my new world
or they can die in their old one.

377
00:27:29,106 --> 00:27:31,775
Well, go and catch daario before he leaves.

378
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:33,235
Tell him I changed my mind.

379
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:35,904
Yes, khaleesi.

380
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:48,625
Tell him you changed my mind.

381
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,889
Hound: Rat cunts.

382
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:06,101
Fucking whore.

383
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:09,104
You're doing it wrong.

384
00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:12,566
You need to burn away
that horrible bit there.

385
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:15,110
Othennise it's gonna
get infected and fester.

386
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:20,282
I know you don't like fire,
but if you don't do it right...

387
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,075
No fire.

388
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:24,995
It'll only take a second.

389
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:28,207
- It won't hurt that much.
- No fire!

390
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,598
Shut up about it.

391
00:28:47,601 --> 00:28:49,811
About everything.

392
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:54,524
Thanks to you, I'm a walking bag of silver
anywhere the lannisters hold sway.

393
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:58,820
Which is everywhere between
where we are now and where we're going.

394
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:05,661
I'm as stupid as that hog
you stuck back in the village,

395
00:29:06,036 --> 00:29:10,082
getting myself out and stabbed and bitten.

396
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:14,878
No reward is worth this much trouble.

397
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:17,798
Wish I'd never laid eyes on you.

398
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:30,769
You say your brother gave you that sword.

399
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:35,357
My brother gave me this.

400
00:29:37,234 --> 00:29:39,528
It was just like you said a while back.

401
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:44,366
Pressed me to the fire like
I was a nice juicy mutton chop.

402
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:51,206
Thought I stole one of his toys.

403
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,542
I didn't steal it. I was
just playing with it.

404
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,590
The pain was bad.

405
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:02,426
The smell was worse.

406
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:10,434
But the worst thing was that
it was my brother who did it.

407
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:17,190
My father, who protected him,

408
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:21,903
told everyone my bedding caught fire.

409
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,960
You think you're on your own?

410
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:43,633
Let me wash it out
and help you sew it up at least.

411
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:12,621
Brienne: Bit of comfort never hurt anyone.

412
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:15,082
We've been sleeping in ditches
the last few weeks.

413
00:31:15,165 --> 00:31:18,168
I think we can treat ourselves to
a featherbed for the night

414
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:20,504
and a hot meal not cooked by you.

415
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:21,880
Couldn't agree more, my lady.

416
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:24,341
Just don't start expecting
silk underclothes.

417
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:26,864
- Not working for your former lord any longer.
- Yes, my lady.

418
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:29,137
Don't get drunk.

419
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:31,556
No, my lady.

420
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,034
Hot pie: Can I get you anything else?

421
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:34,851
No, this will do nicely, thank you.

422
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:36,311
Kidney pie is wonderful.

423
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:38,313
Thanks.

424
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:40,524
I do my best.

425
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:44,486
A good kidney pie is
all about the ingredients.

426
00:31:44,778 --> 00:31:47,823
Flour, lard, water, eggs, milk.

427
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,741
Easy enough. But the meat,

428
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:52,577
peacetime or not, getting your hands on
a good bottom round steak

429
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:54,287
and calves' kidneys is not easy.

430
00:31:54,371 --> 00:31:57,082
I mean, some people settle
for plain old beef kidneys.

431
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:59,793
Got no right to cook anything, them.
Oh, and the gravy.

432
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,629
Don't get me started on the gravy.

433
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:04,131
Very difficult to get right.

434
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:05,966
See, a lot of people give up on the gravy.

435
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:08,176
You cannot give up.

436
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,719
No gravy, no pie.

437
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:11,555
Simple as that.

438
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:15,642
That's nice armour. Are you a knight?

439
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:22,399
Oh, it's just people with armour
are usually knights.

440
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:25,026
Generally speaking.
From king's landing, though, aren't you?

441
00:32:25,152 --> 00:32:27,946
From there myself originally.
Flea bottom born and bred.

442
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:30,198
What brings you to these parts?

443
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,780
We're looking for someone.

444
00:32:31,825 --> 00:32:34,286
Someone in particular?
Maybe they came in here.

445
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:36,681
A lot of people come in here.
Just the other day we had 17...

446
00:32:36,705 --> 00:32:38,790
A girl, tall, red hair, very pretty.

447
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:42,043
Her name is sansa stark,
but she may be using a different name.

448
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:44,296
Starks?

449
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:49,843
What, like them lot from "winterhell"?

450
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:55,849
No, ain't seen anyone like that.

451
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,392
I heard they was all traitors.

452
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,811
Don't need no traitors in here.

453
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:03,148
I pledged my life to their mother
catelyn stark.

454
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:05,233
I swore to her I'd bring
her daughters home.

455
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:12,699
Sure I can't get you a bit more kidney pie?

456
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:29,257
- What?
- It's nothing, my lady.

457
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:32,719
You wouldn't be screwing your face up
like that if it was nothing.

458
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:34,971
Don't want to offend,
my lady. Truly, I don't.

459
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:36,895
You're not interesting
enough to be offensive.

460
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,603
The lannisters want lady sansa.

461
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,647
The lannisters have money.

462
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:45,690
People kill for money.

463
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:50,111
I don't think we should be telling people
we're searching for lady sansa.

464
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:03,041
My lady. My lord. Could I have a word?

465
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:06,628
- What about? Not kidney pie.
- You seem like a proper lady.

466
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:08,838
Someone who could be trusted.

467
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,968
I never met no sansa stark.

468
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:15,262
But I know her sister.

469
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:23,353
No one's seen Arya stark
since her father was beheaded.

470
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:25,230
She's presumed dead.

471
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,607
She weren't when I last spoke to her.

472
00:34:27,691 --> 00:34:30,193
- When was that?
- Heading up north with the night's watch.

473
00:34:30,277 --> 00:34:31,945
She was all dressed up as a boy.

474
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:34,531
Like your ladyship,
only without the armour.

475
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:36,491
Going by the name arry.

476
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:38,201
- So what happened to her?
- Well...

477
00:34:38,285 --> 00:34:39,494
The quick version.

478
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,622
The lannisters took us prisoner.

479
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:44,916
We escaped.

480
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,961
The brotherhood took us prisoner.
They sold me to the innkeep.

481
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:51,840
They were gonna sell Arya to her mother
at riverrun along with another prisoner.

482
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:55,760
Big ugly fellow. Foul mouth
and a face like a half-burnt ham.

483
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:57,721
- Not friendly.
- The hound.

484
00:34:57,804 --> 00:35:00,098
That's the one.

485
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:03,435
If you find her, could you give her this?

486
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:07,063
She liked the last one I gave her,
but, well, this one turned out better.

487
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:20,201
You were saying?

488
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:26,458
Brienne: Her mother's dead,
grandfather's dead,

489
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:28,960
walder frey is the new lord of riverrun.

490
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:30,563
The brotherhood isn't going to riverrun.

491
00:35:30,587 --> 00:35:32,422
They'll take her to the eyrie, my lady.

492
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,633
Why the eyrie?

493
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:36,718
Her aunt, lysa arryn.

494
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,471
Catelyn stark's sister.

495
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:42,724
She's Arya's last living
relative with money.

496
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:45,060
She hates the lannisters.

497
00:35:47,187 --> 00:35:50,065
Lord Tyrion made sure
I knew which house married which

498
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,067
and who hated who.

499
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,819
Brienne: Sansa could be there, too.

500
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:57,906
Podrick: Could be.

501
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:06,331
You sure about this?

502
00:36:42,492 --> 00:36:45,453
I imagined
you'd be back at the brothel at this hour.

503
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:50,041
I did spend some time with an
absolutely stunning blonde the other day.

504
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:53,586
Mmm. Do tell.

505
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:57,841
I've got every kind of filth down here
except the kind I like.

506
00:36:58,299 --> 00:36:59,843
Your sister.

507
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:10,979
Cersei approached me.

508
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:14,149
We spoke a great deal about her daughter.

509
00:37:14,816 --> 00:37:17,318
How worried your sister is about her.

510
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:21,990
She was trying very hard to pretend
she had not come to sway me against you.

511
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:24,701
I think she may have
even believed it herself.

512
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:29,998
Making honest feelings do dishonest work
is one of her many gifts.

513
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:33,001
It was difficult for her
to hide her true intentions.

514
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:38,590
It is rare to meet a Lannister

515
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:42,510
who shares my enthusiasm
for dead lannisters.

516
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:46,598
She desperately wants to see you killed.

517
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:49,559
She didn't need to bother you.

518
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:52,645
It looks as though
I've taken care of that myself.

519
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:57,776
The joy she will feel when
my head leaves my neck.

520
00:37:58,067 --> 00:38:01,029
She's wanted this for a long time.

521
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,948
Yes, I know.

522
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:06,951
We met, you and I.

523
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:08,661
Many years ago.

524
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:11,623
I think I would have remembered that.

525
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:15,001
Unlikely. You had just been born.

526
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:21,716
Our father brought me and my sister elia
with him on a visit to casterly rock.

527
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,885
My first time away from dorne.

528
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,137
I didn't like anything about the rock.

529
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:31,392
Not the food, not the weather,
not your accents.

530
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:32,977
Nothing.

531
00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:37,232
But the biggest disappointment,

532
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:39,234
you.

533
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:44,405
You and my family have more in common
than you might admit.

534
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:48,451
The whole way from dorne
all anyone talked about was

535
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:52,580
the monster that had been born
to tywin Lannister.

536
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:55,542
A head twice the size of his body,

537
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:57,335
a tail between his legs,

538
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:59,546
claws, one red eye,

539
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:02,507
the privates of both a girl and a boy.

540
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,843
That would have made things so much easier.

541
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:08,263
When we met your sister,
she promised she would show you to us.

542
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:12,433
Every day we would ask.
Every day she would say, "soon."

543
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:16,354
Then she and your brother

544
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:17,897
took us to your nursery and...

545
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,611
She unveiled the freak.

546
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:29,534
Your head was a bit large,
your arms and legs were a bit small,

547
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:31,870
but no claw.

548
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:34,455
No red eye. No tail between your legs.

549
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:37,125
Just a tiny pink cock.

550
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:42,255
We didn't try to hide our disappointment.
"That's not a monster," I told Cersei.

551
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:45,508
"That's just a baby."

552
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:49,721
And she said, "he killed my mother."

553
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:54,058
And she pinched your little cock so hard,
I thought she might pull it off.

554
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:56,185
Until your brother made her stop.

555
00:39:56,269 --> 00:39:58,688
"It doesn't matter," she told us.

556
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:00,899
"Everyone says he will die soon.

557
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:02,817
"I hope they are right.

558
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:05,361
"He should not have lived this long."

559
00:40:09,324 --> 00:40:10,867
Well,

560
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:18,166
Sooner or later,
Cersei always gets what she wants.

561
00:40:21,002 --> 00:40:23,755
And what about what I want?

562
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:27,675
Jusfice

563
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:31,304
for my sister and her children.

564
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:33,431
If you want justice,

565
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:36,267
you've come to the wrong place.

566
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:38,478
I disagree.

567
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,863
I've come to the perfect place.

568
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:53,117
I want to bring those who have wronged me
to justice.

569
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:56,079
And all those who have wronged me
are right here.

570
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:01,000
I will begin with ser Gregor clegane,

571
00:41:01,501 --> 00:41:03,628
who killed my sister's children

572
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:07,090
and then raped her
with their blood still on his hands

573
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:09,884
before killing her, too.

574
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:20,603
I will be your champion.

575
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,951
Hello, Robin.

576
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:20,204
What are you doing?

577
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:23,249
I'm building my home, winterfell.

578
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:27,336
At least I think I am. I haven't
been back there in a very long time.

579
00:42:28,421 --> 00:42:29,756
Why did you leave?

580
00:42:30,006 --> 00:42:32,300
It's a long story.

581
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:34,802
I stay here in the eyrie.

582
00:42:35,178 --> 00:42:37,939
Mother says it's dangerous on the roads
and I have to keep myself safe

583
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:39,724
because I'm the lord of the vale

584
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:42,143
and a very important person.

585
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:44,479
Yes, you certainly are.

586
00:42:45,438 --> 00:42:46,814
When will you go back?

587
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,776
Probably never.

588
00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:53,946
My family doesn't live there any more
and someone burned it down.

589
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:00,161
Does winterfell have a moon door?

590
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:01,621
No, I'm afraid not.

591
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:03,807
It's not high up in the mountains.
It's down on the ground.

592
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:05,917
That sounds dangerous.

593
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,419
- How do you make people fly?
- We don't.

594
00:43:08,503 --> 00:43:10,023
What do you do with all the bad people

595
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:12,507
and the scary people
and the people you don't like?

596
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,550
I never did anything with them at all.

597
00:43:14,634 --> 00:43:16,761
Girls didn't take part in that
where I came from.

598
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,139
Well, I'm lord of the vale.

599
00:43:20,223 --> 00:43:23,726
When I grow up,
I'll be able to fly anybody who bothers me.

600
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:25,770
Or you. When we get married,

601
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:27,772
you can tell me if you don't like somebody

602
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:29,899
and then we can bring them
back here and, whoosh!

603
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:31,609
Right through the moon door.

604
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:35,279
I like the sound of that.

605
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:37,073
Let's put a moon door in your winterfell.

606
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:38,449
All right.

607
00:43:38,533 --> 00:43:41,744
- It can go in here in this big tower.
- Be careful.

608
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:44,348
You've ruined it. Now I'm going to have to
rebuild the whole thing.

609
00:43:44,372 --> 00:43:45,706
- I didn't ruin it.
- You did.

610
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:47,768
It was already ruined
because it didn't have a moon door.

611
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:50,461
- I was fixing it.
- Knocking things down isn't fixing them.

612
00:43:50,545 --> 00:43:52,105
- It's ruining them.
- I didn't ruin it!

613
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:54,173
- You're being stupid.
- I didn't ruin it!

614
00:44:06,102 --> 00:44:08,855
Robin, I'm sorry, I...

615
00:44:08,938 --> 00:44:10,565
Littlefinger: Children.

616
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:16,445
- I hit him.
- Yes, I saw.

617
00:44:16,529 --> 00:44:19,448
- I shouldn't have done that.
- No.

618
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:22,785
His mother should have, a long time ago.

619
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:27,039
Consider it a step in the right direction.

620
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:29,876
If he tells aunt lysa...

621
00:44:29,959 --> 00:44:32,211
Let me worry about aunt lysa.

622
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:36,174
I was trying to remember
what everything looked like.

623
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:39,969
I'll never see it again.

624
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:44,348
A lot can happen between now and never.

625
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:48,936
If you want to build a better home,

626
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:51,856
first you must demolish the old one.

627
00:44:54,442 --> 00:44:56,527
Why did you really kill Joffrey?

628
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:02,867
Tell me why.

629
00:45:07,747 --> 00:45:11,125
I loved your mother
more than you could ever know.

630
00:45:13,586 --> 00:45:14,754
Given the opportunity,

631
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:18,132
what do we do to
those who've hurt the ones we love?

632
00:45:26,182 --> 00:45:28,684
In a better world,

633
00:45:28,768 --> 00:45:34,482
one where love could
overcome strength and duty,

634
00:45:35,942 --> 00:45:38,277
you might have been my child.

635
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:43,783
But we don't live in that world.

636
00:45:54,919 --> 00:45:57,713
You're more beautiful than she ever was.

637
00:45:59,507 --> 00:46:01,008
Lord baelish...

638
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:02,969
Call me petyr.

639
00:46:30,246 --> 00:46:32,456
You wanted to see me, aunt lysa?

640
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:36,210
Come here, sansa.

641
00:46:50,308 --> 00:46:52,560
Do you know how far the fall is?

642
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:58,190
Neither do I, precisely.

643
00:46:58,274 --> 00:47:00,401
Hundreds of feet.

644
00:47:00,985 --> 00:47:02,653
It's fascinating

645
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:06,282
what happens to bodies when
they hit the rocks from such a height.

646
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:08,576
The impact breaks them right apart.

647
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:11,871
Like eggs dropped on the floor.

648
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:14,373
Sometimes pieces remain intact.

649
00:47:14,749 --> 00:47:17,335
You'll find the head sitting on its own.

650
00:47:17,418 --> 00:47:19,462
Every hair in place.

651
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:22,298
Blue eyes staring at nothing.

652
00:47:31,432 --> 00:47:33,934
I know what you did.

653
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:37,730
I'm so sorry, aunt lysa.

654
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:39,982
I never should have hit Robin.

655
00:47:40,066 --> 00:47:42,419
- I promise it won't happen...
- Don't be coy with me, you little whore.

656
00:47:42,443 --> 00:47:44,862
You kissed petyr.

657
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:47,239
- I didn't. You don't understand.
- I saw you.

658
00:47:47,323 --> 00:47:50,451
You can't lie to me
because I saw it with my own eyes.

659
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:52,912
- He kissed me. I pulled away.
- Liar! Whore!

660
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:55,289
He is mine!

661
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:57,958
My father, my husband, my sister,

662
00:47:58,042 --> 00:48:00,086
they all stood between us
and now they're all dead.

663
00:48:00,169 --> 00:48:04,048
That's what happens to people
who stand between petyr and me.

664
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:05,716
Look down!

665
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:09,053
- Look down!
- Littlefinger: Lysa!

666
00:48:12,348 --> 00:48:14,016
Let her go.

667
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:18,813
You want her?

668
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:22,733
This empty-headed child?

669
00:48:22,817 --> 00:48:23,818
Let her go.

670
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:27,154
She's just like her mother.
She'll never love you.

671
00:48:27,822 --> 00:48:31,409
I lied for you. I killed for you.

672
00:48:31,492 --> 00:48:34,578
- Why did you bring her here?
- I'll send her away.

673
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:39,750
I swear on my life.

674
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:43,421
I swear to all the gods.

675
00:48:44,547 --> 00:48:46,424
Let her go, lysa.

676
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:05,234
Oh, my sweet wife.

677
00:49:08,988 --> 00:49:12,324
My sweet, silly wife.

678
00:49:19,707 --> 00:49:22,209
I have only loved one woman,

679
00:49:23,544 --> 00:49:26,088
only one, my entire life.

680
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:33,846
Your sister.
