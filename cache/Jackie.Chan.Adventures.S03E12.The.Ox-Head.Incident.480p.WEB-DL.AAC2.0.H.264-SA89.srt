[Grunt] Oh...

00:00:12,245 --> 00:00:15,080
Sensei, perhaps
we should rest.

00:00:15,082 --> 00:00:18,117
What? Uncle
has barely
broken a sweat!

Uh, have an
energy bar, Jade.

00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:29,762
Can't...Chew,

00:00:29,764 --> 00:00:32,464
no energy.

10
00:00:32,466 --> 00:00:35,734
Uncle, the high altitude
of the himalayas

11
00:00:35,736 --> 00:00:38,037
requires a slower pace.

12
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:42,107
But forces of darkness
require a quicker pace.

13
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:45,477
We must find the ox
which possesses the power
of super-strength

14
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:47,446
before daolon wong does.

Locator indicates
ox is on opposite
side of mountain.

17
00:00:56,023 --> 00:00:59,124
We must go back down
and come up other way.

[Both groan]

19

don't you
have a spell

that'll just
poof us over there?
Anything?

21
00:01:04,932 --> 00:01:07,166

Jackie: A yak?

27
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:24,743
A super-strong yak.

28
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:27,146
A yak is a type of ox.

29
00:02:27,148 --> 00:02:31,216
And this yak
is the ox we seek.

30
00:02:31,218 --> 00:02:33,619
But why did it
plow through
the mountain?

31
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:36,488
He wants
my energy bar.

32
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:40,058
He must have
a super-strong
sense of smell, too.

33
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:43,595
We must bring the ox
to the sanctuary of
the Ben shui temple

34
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:47,032
before the forces
of dark chi
descend upon us.

Consider yourselves
descended upon, gramps.

You know how much
we care about you guys,

been riding us

to get rid of you,
once and for all.

We're sure
gonna miss ya.

why I should not
destroy you instantly!

'Cause, things
are about to change?

the powers of
the talismans,

64
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:23,895
Allow me to suggest
you end your quest
for the ox,

65
00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:26,498
as it is a power
I intend to obtain.

Ung!

67
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:34,706
Then obtain it,
dear warrior, for me.

Aah!

69
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:46,151
Uncle has been
devising a spell

70
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:48,287
to transfer
the talisman powers

71
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:50,889
from the animals
we have collected.

72
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:52,991
Tohru,
as my apprentice,

73
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:54,359
you will seek
proper vessels

74
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:57,029
with which
to contain the powers.

75
00:04:57,031 --> 00:04:58,797
How about
putting the speedy
rabbit power

76
00:04:58,799 --> 00:04:59,898
in wristwatch form?

77
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,633
That way, if you see
you're running late,

horse thermometer?

your temperature,
you're already better.

No, daolon wong is near.

We must
protect the ox.

00:05:18,786 --> 00:05:22,888
Ox not important.
Power within ox is.

87
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,891
I will attempt
to keep the magic

88
00:05:25,893 --> 00:05:30,362
from daolon wong's reach
by casting new
transfer spell.

transfer the power to?

Essentially
his life force.

Without it,
he is doomed to remain
in this dormant state.

We have to rescue

Yes, it is.

00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:30,362
So, do you want
a piece of uncle?

169
00:10:30,364 --> 00:10:35,133
I will just require
my other pieces first.

170

If you ever want to see
your pieces again,

Uncle is hungry.

I shall peel
back the layers.

into the recesses
of your mind.

Your nephew has
already demonstrated

that he is no match
for my most
savage warrior.

your precious hak foo?

No. It should only glow
when the power is near.

No!

Uncle, why does hak foo
have your body?

241
00:15:44,311 --> 00:15:47,979
Because that is where
the power of the ox
resides.

242
00:15:47,981 --> 00:15:50,148
Of course it is.

turn to cast a spell?

[Gulp] Yes, I must.

Good. My Patience
wears thin.

You will pay
for your cleverness,
good wizard,

for once I absorb
the power within you,

255
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:28,853
I shall see to it
that your spirit head

256

has nowhere to return.

257
