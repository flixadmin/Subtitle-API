1
00:00:01,694 --> 00:00:03,577
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:03,654 --> 00:00:05,320
Did Walker destroy Haven?

3
00:00:05,389 --> 00:00:08,578
<i>This part of the op is need-to-know.</i>

4
00:00:14,827 --> 00:00:16,135
I come bearing gifts.

5
00:00:21,147 --> 00:00:23,670
Reunification with the mainland

6
00:00:23,725 --> 00:00:25,354
<i>hangs on by a thread.</i>

7
00:00:25,401 --> 00:00:29,096
<i>Toxic chemicals rain down onto
the city, and the government</i>

8
00:00:29,151 --> 00:00:30,705
cuts us adrift for good.

9
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,306
<i>The filtration system</i>

10
00:00:32,378 --> 00:00:34,687
<i>that Lucius designed is working.</i>

11
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,000
<i>It's not glamorous work,</i>

12
00:00:36,076 --> 00:00:39,161
but we are helping to save the
lives of thousands of people.

13
00:00:39,171 --> 00:00:40,765
You're leaving Gotham.

14
00:00:40,804 --> 00:00:42,215
<i>I believe the time has come</i>

15
00:00:42,265 --> 00:00:44,187
<i>for a change of scenery.</i>

16
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,337
- You found a way out of Gotham?
- It's a submarine.

17
00:00:47,397 --> 00:00:52,836
<i>Jim Gordon and
Lee Thompkins are man and wife.</i>

18
00:00:52,899 --> 00:00:56,067
<i>He will never see you as anything but</i>

19
00:00:56,143 --> 00:00:59,289
a dangerous woman
keeping his child from him.

20
00:01:00,055 --> 00:01:01,982
Eduardo.

21
00:01:02,091 --> 00:01:03,505
Walker.

22
00:01:03,613 --> 00:01:07,154
Professor Strange'll have you
fixed up in no time.

23
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,760
Rest easy, Eduardo.

24
00:01:49,772 --> 00:01:52,197
I made you a promise when I found you

25
00:01:52,274 --> 00:01:53,782
in that hole in Peña Dura.

26
00:01:53,793 --> 00:01:57,795
And I intend to keep it.

27
00:01:57,872 --> 00:02:01,530
To give you a true purpose

28
00:02:01,801 --> 00:02:05,136
and the strength to see it through.

29
00:02:05,212 --> 00:02:09,702
However, I'm afraid this process

30
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:14,233
will be agonizing and, unfortunately,

31
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,618
quite lengthy.

32
00:02:17,754 --> 00:02:20,981
Apologies in advance.

33
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:03,208
You're going to be reborn.

34
00:03:03,713 --> 00:03:06,773
And then you'll be
the bane of the unjust.

35
00:03:08,193 --> 00:03:10,582
The bane of the corrupt.

36
00:03:10,685 --> 00:03:13,793
The bane of anyone who opposes us.

37

38
00:03:31,325 --> 00:03:32,958
Radio confirmation.

39
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:35,171
General Wade's landing craft docked.

40
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:37,258
His convoy's on the way here now.

41
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,289
Reunification day is today.

42
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,861
Harv, that is great news, but then what?

43
00:03:42,938 --> 00:03:44,479
Just 'cause we rebuild some bridges

44
00:03:44,556 --> 00:03:47,246
doesn't mean things are
gonna suddenly improve.

45
00:03:47,317 --> 00:03:50,536
So, uh, future got you spooked?

46
00:03:50,612 --> 00:03:51,945
Yeah, I guess.

47
00:03:52,022 --> 00:03:54,098
I mean, I want to believe
things are gonna get better,

48
00:03:54,137 --> 00:03:56,324
but sometimes it's just hard
for me to see it, you know.

49
00:03:56,401 --> 00:03:58,223
Can't say I understand.

50
00:03:58,317 --> 00:04:00,356
I don't have kids, at
least none that I know of.

51
00:04:00,543 --> 00:04:03,044
But you got one coming,

52
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,332
so we got no choice but to believe.

53
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:08,706
It's got to be better than
what we've been through, right?

54
00:04:09,393 --> 00:04:11,448
It damn well better be.

55
00:04:12,768 --> 00:04:16,721
Seven days in a row of
.07 water toxicity levels.

56
00:04:16,846 --> 00:04:18,418
Lucius's filters did the job.

57
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:20,042
Eh, good work. Hope it's not wasted.

58
00:04:20,067 --> 00:04:21,691
Is there a reason to
think there's a problem?

59
00:04:21,776 --> 00:04:23,037
Jim's got a lot on his mind.

60
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,920
What with Gotham rejoining the world

61
00:04:24,982 --> 00:04:26,545
and a baby coming
into the world next week.

62
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,811
Give it a rest, Harvey.

63
00:04:27,873 --> 00:04:29,783
All joking aside.

64
00:04:29,846 --> 00:04:33,830
We're here because of you. Mm?

65
00:04:33,901 --> 00:04:36,267
And you're gonna be a father.
That's a future I'll take.

66
00:04:43,274 --> 00:04:45,590
Over the past year,

67
00:04:46,271 --> 00:04:48,069
you've all done good work.

68
00:04:48,366 --> 00:04:52,460
We've made Gotham a safe place
for kids and families.

69
00:04:52,779 --> 00:04:55,952
We've given people the food
and medicine they needed.

70
00:04:57,207 --> 00:04:59,445
But it's not over yet.

71
00:04:59,802 --> 00:05:02,789
So, no matter what
General Wade says today,

72
00:05:04,405 --> 00:05:06,385
the work continues.

73
00:05:07,976 --> 00:05:10,119
Give yourselves
one more round of applause.

74
00:05:13,154 --> 00:05:14,904
And get back to work.

75
00:05:23,405 --> 00:05:24,914
Here they come.

76
00:05:47,238 --> 00:05:49,255
Captain Gordon.

77
00:05:49,383 --> 00:05:51,211
Nice to finally meet you in the flesh.

78
00:05:51,273 --> 00:05:53,809
General, welcome to Gotham.

79
00:05:53,885 --> 00:05:56,039
Good that you've reestablished
some semblance

80
00:05:56,107 --> 00:05:57,531
of law and order around here.

81
00:05:57,586 --> 00:05:59,242
Seems like the Green Zone

82
00:05:59,328 --> 00:06:01,383
stretches to every corner of the island.

83
00:06:01,703 --> 00:06:05,070
General, Wayne Labs show toxicity levels

84
00:06:05,148 --> 00:06:07,103
way below the threshold
the government set for us.

85
00:06:07,176 --> 00:06:08,584
All due respect, Mr. Wayne,

86
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,351
but I got to go with what
my people tell me on this.

87
00:06:37,209 --> 00:06:39,727
Cutting it a little close, aren't we?

88
00:06:39,804 --> 00:06:41,872
Is that under 27 pounds, 13 ounces?

89
00:06:41,927 --> 00:06:44,997
It can't possibly
make that big a difference.

90
00:06:45,059 --> 00:06:47,234
It's only the difference
between getting off this island

91
00:06:47,311 --> 00:06:48,880
or sinking to the bottom of the river.

92
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,853
Well, then Pengy can off-load
a few of his knickknacks.

93
00:06:51,934 --> 00:06:53,242
Not a chance.

94
00:06:53,327 --> 00:06:57,004
Because you know what's worth
its weight in gold?

95
00:06:57,729 --> 00:07:00,197
- Gold.
- Ah!

96
00:07:05,096 --> 00:07:06,588
Congratulations!

97
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:11,355
Go to the clinic. Go have your baby.

98
00:07:11,427 --> 00:07:13,335
What? So the two of you can hightail it

99
00:07:13,412 --> 00:07:15,159
off this rock without me?
I don't think so.

100
00:07:15,206 --> 00:07:18,507
I assure you we will not
launch without you.

101
00:07:18,578 --> 00:07:20,384
Ed and I will finish making preparations

102
00:07:20,451 --> 00:07:23,039
and we will be ready to launch
the moment you get back here

103
00:07:23,101 --> 00:07:24,938
with that little bundle of joy.

104
00:07:26,442 --> 00:07:28,737
Or unless I should
drive you to the clinic

105
00:07:28,785 --> 00:07:30,268
in light of your delicate condition?

106
00:07:30,331 --> 00:07:33,063
I can do it. I'm not that delicate.

107
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,616
Remember that if you even think

108
00:07:35,693 --> 00:07:37,952
about double-crossing me.

109
00:07:43,411 --> 00:07:45,341
It's very kind of you
to offer to drive her.

110
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:47,628
I knew she would never accept my help.

111
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:51,417
Should I start the engine?

112
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,996
One less passenger to worry about.

113
00:07:53,059 --> 00:07:54,598
Oh, two, actually.

114
00:07:54,676 --> 00:07:56,643
You are so right.

115
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,239
Found it.

116
00:08:24,316 --> 00:08:26,542
Ah, well done, Miss Kyle.

117
00:08:27,912 --> 00:08:30,254
All right, let's have a look.

118
00:08:31,081 --> 00:08:33,415
Uh, here we are.

119
00:08:34,482 --> 00:08:38,278
Oh, so this guy's the architect
who designed Wayne Manor?

120
00:08:38,347 --> 00:08:39,864
Yes, right.

121
00:08:39,976 --> 00:08:44,237
With the reunification,
a new Wayne Manor must follow.

122
00:08:44,354 --> 00:08:47,810
And it'll be just like the old one?

123
00:08:48,051 --> 00:08:50,536
Oh, nothing is just like it was.

124
00:08:51,812 --> 00:08:54,873
So why are we looking at the old plans?

125
00:08:55,504 --> 00:08:58,255
Perhaps I'm not ready
to let go of the past.

126
00:09:02,013 --> 00:09:03,638
Well, if it makes you feel better,

127
00:09:03,693 --> 00:09:06,783
I wish I could blow up my past.

128
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:10,517
Well, maybe you will.

129
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:13,214
One day, when you build something new,

130
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:15,716
the past will always be part of it.

131
00:09:15,793 --> 00:09:17,917
As for me,

132
00:09:18,006 --> 00:09:20,232
now Master Bruce is grown,

133
00:09:20,349 --> 00:09:24,640
building a new manor might be
my last great service to him.

134
00:09:25,711 --> 00:09:27,546
A home.

135
00:09:28,428 --> 00:09:30,531
And then what?

136
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:33,994
You retire?

137
00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:36,949
No.

138
00:09:39,411 --> 00:09:43,222
I will stand guard, as I've always done.

139
00:09:48,275 --> 00:09:51,101
I thought this was all settled.
This is bull.

140
00:09:51,145 --> 00:09:52,661
My results are accurate, Jim.

141
00:09:52,738 --> 00:09:55,109
We don't know this general.
Maybe he's with Walker.

142
00:09:55,196 --> 00:09:59,114
Let's not get carried away.
Bruce, go and check on the tech.

143
00:10:03,114 --> 00:10:04,686
This is Gordon.

144
00:10:04,761 --> 00:10:06,607
<i>It's Lee.</i>

145
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:08,647
<i>Everything okay?</i>

146
00:10:09,732 --> 00:10:11,041
Barbara just showed up here,

147
00:10:11,086 --> 00:10:12,628
in labor.

148
00:10:12,704 --> 00:10:14,296
You're kidding.

149
00:10:14,365 --> 00:10:16,259
<i>You better come quick.</i>

150
00:10:20,163 --> 00:10:22,218
Are you okay?

151
00:10:23,482 --> 00:10:25,774
Yeah. Yeah.

152
00:10:28,273 --> 00:10:30,044
<i>I'll try to get over there
as soon as I can.</i>

153
00:10:30,892 --> 00:10:32,293
<i>Try to.</i>

154
00:10:32,369 --> 00:10:35,669
Um... try to wait for me.

155
00:10:35,743 --> 00:10:38,485
It doesn't really work that way.

156
00:10:38,536 --> 00:10:40,328
I know.

157
00:10:40,735 --> 00:10:42,071
Okay.

158
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,275
<i>Wait.</i>

159
00:10:46,315 --> 00:10:48,065
I love you.

160
00:10:51,514 --> 00:10:52,884
I love you, too.

161
00:10:53,298 --> 00:10:54,827
Jim!

162
00:10:55,483 --> 00:10:56,767
What? What's wrong?

163
00:10:56,843 --> 00:10:58,268
We did it.

164
00:10:58,337 --> 00:11:00,045
You did it. We got through it, Jim.

165
00:11:00,148 --> 00:11:01,327
Captain.

166
00:11:01,622 --> 00:11:03,464
All clear.

167
00:11:03,522 --> 00:11:04,666
Congratulations.

168
00:11:04,713 --> 00:11:07,023
Reunification can begin.

169
00:11:08,885 --> 00:11:11,150
Well, I'm glad I can make you so happy.

170
00:11:11,256 --> 00:11:13,932
Funny thing is, sir,

171
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:16,782
that's just the second best
news I've gotten today.

172
00:11:18,688 --> 00:11:20,681
What's that?

173
00:11:22,912 --> 00:11:25,059
- Jim.
- Incoming!

174
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:28,754
Everybody get back!

175
00:11:28,817 --> 00:11:31,451
Get inside! Get inside!

176
00:11:36,511 --> 00:11:37,589
Go, go.

177
00:12:12,575 --> 00:12:14,333
Eduardo?

178
00:12:16,018 --> 00:12:17,442
<i>Not anymore.</i>

179
00:12:49,893 --> 00:12:52,193
All right, people, listen up.

180
00:12:52,309 --> 00:12:55,472
I want squads
headed for Knights Stadium,

181
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,070
Yeavley Park, and Granton Station.

182
00:12:58,132 --> 00:13:00,733
Work your way out.
We got to find him, people.

183
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:03,727
What the bloody hell happened?

184
00:13:03,804 --> 00:13:05,104
Seems that Jim's old army buddy

185
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:07,125
wasn't quite as dead as we'd hoped.

186
00:13:07,195 --> 00:13:09,063
I got squads covering the north side.

187
00:13:09,143 --> 00:13:10,357
They're sweeping from Coventry

188
00:13:10,436 --> 00:13:12,295
down to Miller Harbor,
but they could be anywhere.

189
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:13,522
Well, give us an area to search

190
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,997
- and we'll get it covered.
- Uh...

191
00:13:15,074 --> 00:13:17,815
Take Reatton, work
your way to South City Park.

192
00:13:17,894 --> 00:13:20,534
Looks like you're not done
protecting Bruce yet, Alfred.

193
00:13:32,217 --> 00:13:34,098
Eduardo.

194
00:13:34,966 --> 00:13:37,160
What did Walker do to you?

195
00:13:39,168 --> 00:13:42,387
<i>When I was in Peña Dura prison, Jim,</i>

196
00:13:42,492 --> 00:13:45,031
<i>the guards played a game.</i>

197
00:13:45,601 --> 00:13:47,479
<i>They'd choose one of us...</i>

198
00:13:47,556 --> 00:13:49,023
<i>and they buried us alive.</i>

199
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,291
<i>They'd take bets on whether
you could dig your way out.</i>

200
00:13:52,381 --> 00:13:55,858
<i>But then they'd bury you deeper.</i>

201
00:13:56,299 --> 00:13:58,350
<i>And play again.</i>

202
00:13:59,528 --> 00:14:01,546
<i>I was the champion.</i>

203
00:14:02,887 --> 00:14:05,042
<i>To survive that...</i>

204
00:14:05,124 --> 00:14:07,868
<i>I had to stop being human.</i>

205
00:14:08,836 --> 00:14:12,680
<i>I had to become... something else.</i>

206
00:14:14,392 --> 00:14:15,784
<i>I became Bane.</i>

207
00:14:17,445 --> 00:14:19,411
<i>Only I didn't know it yet.</i>

208
00:14:19,481 --> 00:14:24,138
<i>But she knew and she showed me the way.</i>

209
00:14:24,218 --> 00:14:26,450
<i>If the world is full of monsters,</i>

210
00:14:26,523 --> 00:14:28,794
<i>the only way to defeat them...</i>

211
00:14:28,838 --> 00:14:30,888
<i>is to become one yourself.</i>

212
00:14:33,077 --> 00:14:35,077
I'm sorry.

213
00:14:35,154 --> 00:14:37,154
You were a good soldier.

214
00:14:37,231 --> 00:14:39,031
<i>Hmm.</i>

215
00:14:39,108 --> 00:14:40,473
<i>Don't pity me, Jim.</i>

216
00:14:41,609 --> 00:14:44,035
<i>We are building the future.</i>

217
00:14:44,506 --> 00:14:46,732
<i>She's given me a purity of mission.</i>

218
00:14:46,795 --> 00:14:47,893
<i>And unlike the army,</i>

219
00:14:47,938 --> 00:14:50,756
<i>she is willing to carry things out.</i>

220
00:14:52,171 --> 00:14:54,691
<i>A new world is coming.</i>

221
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:56,691
<i>Strong...</i>

222
00:14:57,539 --> 00:14:59,131
<i>merciless...</i>

223
00:14:59,223 --> 00:15:00,605
<i>unyielding.</i>

224
00:15:00,717 --> 00:15:02,851
I've heard it all before.

225
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:05,594
Not gonna happen.

226
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:10,016
<i>And how are you going to stop me, Jim?</i>

227
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:11,659
Not me.

228
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:14,323
You kidnapped Bruce Wayne and
a general of the U.S. Army.

229
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,817
You talk about your future,
Eduardo, but you don't have one.

230
00:15:18,697 --> 00:15:20,823
<i>But Eduardo's dead, Jim.</i>

231
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:24,243
<i>There is only Bane now.</i>

232
00:15:27,966 --> 00:15:29,230
<i>Rise.</i>

233
00:15:31,852 --> 00:15:34,370
<i>I said rise!</i>

234
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,213
Not so formal.

235
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:38,557
Captain and I are acquainted.

236
00:15:40,684 --> 00:15:43,035
Get the other one.

237
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:48,629
I recognize your voice,

238
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:50,300
but I don't know what to call you.

239
00:15:51,089 --> 00:15:53,147
I know it's not Walker.

240
00:15:53,821 --> 00:15:55,947
So who are you?

241
00:15:56,569 --> 00:15:59,150
That's a good question.

242
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:04,087
Perhaps Bruce Wayne can help us
figure that one out.

243
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,906
You okay?

244
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,109
Yeah.

245
00:16:15,162 --> 00:16:17,129
You want hostages?

246
00:16:17,206 --> 00:16:19,423
You've got me and a
general of the U.S. Army.

247
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,591
Let him go.

248
00:16:20,667 --> 00:16:22,560
This has nothing to do with him.

249
00:16:23,504 --> 00:16:25,846
"This has nothing to do with him"?

250
00:16:25,898 --> 00:16:29,692
But, Captain, you don't
even know what "this" is.

251
00:16:29,769 --> 00:16:33,320
This, everything I have done here,

252
00:16:33,383 --> 00:16:35,582
is about punishing Gotham.

253
00:16:36,262 --> 00:16:39,575
For the sins of Bruce Wayne.

254
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:43,039
You can start now.

255
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,223
No... no!

256
00:16:52,299 --> 00:16:54,512
And again.

257
00:16:57,911 --> 00:16:59,756
So...

258
00:16:59,891 --> 00:17:01,522
Bruce Wayne.

259
00:17:02,543 --> 00:17:04,802
I'm thinking of a name.

260
00:17:04,878 --> 00:17:07,222
Can you guess whose it is?

261
00:17:07,347 --> 00:17:11,112
- What?
- Wrong. And again.

262
00:17:13,646 --> 00:17:15,511
Want to take another guess?

263
00:17:21,103 --> 00:17:24,113
Farewell, my beloved Gotham.

264
00:17:24,189 --> 00:17:27,157
City of my birth.

265
00:17:27,234 --> 00:17:31,504
Parting is such sweet sorrow.

266
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,250
Though I leave you today...

267
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:39,086
my heart will always remain.

268
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:42,185
I do so hate goodbyes.

269
00:17:42,241 --> 00:17:43,849
Well, you're in luck.
We're not going anywhere.

270
00:17:43,874 --> 00:17:45,548
- What are you talking about?
- Engine won't start;

271
00:17:45,611 --> 00:17:47,010
pressure regulator valve's missing.

272
00:17:47,087 --> 00:17:48,759
Or rather it's stolen.

273
00:17:51,967 --> 00:17:55,520
Barbara!

274
00:17:58,098 --> 00:17:59,741
Blood pressure's normal.

275
00:18:00,381 --> 00:18:02,850
I'm glad something about this is normal.

276
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:06,163
So how long's this gonna take,
Doc, soup to nuts?

277
00:18:06,225 --> 00:18:08,448
Are you in a hurry or something?

278
00:18:08,834 --> 00:18:11,045
No, it's just that, uh...

279
00:18:11,561 --> 00:18:13,249
I just feel like you've been...

280
00:18:13,322 --> 00:18:14,955
so great about this, and,

281
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:17,260
you know, it's been
awkward as hell for you, and...

282
00:18:18,221 --> 00:18:20,057
I haven't even really said thank you.

283
00:18:20,151 --> 00:18:22,125
I don't expect a thank you
from you, Barbara.

284
00:18:22,199 --> 00:18:24,024
Then perhaps the best
thank you would be for me

285
00:18:24,112 --> 00:18:26,046
to get out of here as soon as possible.

286
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,382
Whatever's on your mind...

287
00:18:31,393 --> 00:18:34,018
the health of the baby comes first.

288
00:18:34,563 --> 00:18:36,178
I know that.

289
00:18:36,255 --> 00:18:38,389
So, long haul or short, we're here.

290
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,483
Until you have
a healthy baby in your arms.

291
00:18:41,719 --> 00:18:43,278
That's all I want.

292
00:18:44,263 --> 00:18:46,281
Okay.

293
00:18:55,959 --> 00:18:57,509
Stop it!

294
00:18:58,328 --> 00:19:01,087
A name, a person.

295
00:19:01,164 --> 00:19:04,075
The reason this is all happening.

296
00:19:04,426 --> 00:19:06,895
Can't you guess yet?

297
00:19:06,985 --> 00:19:09,130
I don't know!

298
00:19:13,763 --> 00:19:16,310
If you want to punish me, then do it.

299
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,825
Hurt me, not him.

300
00:19:17,918 --> 00:19:20,200
I am hurting you.

301
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:23,227
There's nothing more painful

302
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:25,563
than seeing your friends suffer.

303
00:19:26,673 --> 00:19:30,399
But he's more than just a friend,
isn't he, Bruce?

304
00:19:30,476 --> 00:19:34,054
Jim Gordon's been like a father to you.

305
00:19:35,698 --> 00:19:39,593
How awful it must be
to watch another father die.

306
00:19:42,921 --> 00:19:45,379
Who am I doing this for?

307
00:19:45,404 --> 00:19:47,278
Say the name.

308
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:57,390
When the ones you love die...

309
00:19:57,468 --> 00:20:00,986
it's like a part of yourself
is cut off...

310
00:20:01,063 --> 00:20:02,437
forever.

311
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,207
You know that.

312
00:20:08,535 --> 00:20:11,340
So why do I hate you so much?

313
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:13,448
Who was cut away from me?

314
00:20:13,525 --> 00:20:15,825
Last chance.

315
00:20:33,163 --> 00:20:35,687
Yes.

316
00:20:35,764 --> 00:20:37,314
Now you know.

317
00:20:39,342 --> 00:20:41,935
Say his name.

318
00:20:42,012 --> 00:20:44,020
Say it.

319
00:20:44,089 --> 00:20:46,156
Ra's al Ghul.

320
00:20:48,192 --> 00:20:50,814
This is revenge for his death.

321
00:20:53,249 --> 00:20:55,374
And who am I?

322
00:20:57,288 --> 00:20:58,755
You're his daughter.

323
00:21:03,736 --> 00:21:07,052
My name is Nyssa al Ghul.

324
00:21:07,121 --> 00:21:11,090
And revenge is just
the beginning of what I want.

325
00:21:22,326 --> 00:21:25,061
The League of Shadows is everywhere.

326
00:21:25,132 --> 00:21:28,543
Did you think my father's
mission would die with him?

327
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:32,393
Humankind will be purged of weakness.

328
00:21:32,462 --> 00:21:36,313
I'm just starting with you and yours.

329
00:21:38,927 --> 00:21:41,019
You're right.

330
00:21:41,096 --> 00:21:43,079
I killed Ra's.

331
00:21:44,412 --> 00:21:46,379
So whatever you need to do...

332
00:21:46,494 --> 00:21:48,720
do it to me.

333
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,073
No.

334
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:56,118
You can't take all the blame
for killing my father.

335
00:21:56,503 --> 00:22:00,805
I mean, you did have some help, right?

336
00:22:02,006 --> 00:22:06,476
Someone who quite literally
gave you a helping hand.

337
00:22:07,956 --> 00:22:09,890
What are you doing?

338
00:22:17,061 --> 00:22:19,404
Well done, Barbara.

339
00:22:25,169 --> 00:22:26,508
Go get Barbara Kean.

340
00:22:29,324 --> 00:22:30,821
Eduardo...

341
00:22:33,567 --> 00:22:35,645
She's pregnant.

342
00:22:36,526 --> 00:22:38,285
She's carrying a child.

343
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,136
<i>A child.</i>

344
00:22:43,328 --> 00:22:46,586
<i>One soul's future
weighed against the world's.</i>

345
00:22:48,441 --> 00:22:50,891
<i>Your concern seems petty, Jim.</i>

346
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,688
If he touches a hair
on that child's head,

347
00:22:57,765 --> 00:22:59,926
I will destroy everything you have.

348
00:22:59,998 --> 00:23:04,480
I don't have anything left,
just my father's mission.

349
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:12,883
Bane wants you to join
that mission with us.

350
00:23:14,523 --> 00:23:17,157
To see the world as he sees it.

351
00:23:17,234 --> 00:23:20,202
- Never.
- Never say never,

352
00:23:20,227 --> 00:23:22,669
- Captain Gordon.
- No!

353
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:28,427
How does it feel, Bruce,

354
00:23:28,568 --> 00:23:32,250
knowing that all of this is your fault?

355
00:23:33,801 --> 00:23:37,144
Tell me. I'd really like to know.

356
00:23:44,219 --> 00:23:46,348
There must be something you can give me.

357
00:23:46,418 --> 00:23:48,480
We're out of the drugs that you need.

358
00:23:48,557 --> 00:23:51,078
It's okay. You're almost there.

359
00:23:51,141 --> 00:23:53,320
I'll get you some ice chips
so you don't get dehydrated.

360
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,149
Gee, thanks.

361
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,797
Lee.

362
00:24:00,978 --> 00:24:02,500
Ed.

363
00:24:03,164 --> 00:24:05,427
Don't worry, I'm not here for you.

364
00:24:06,616 --> 00:24:10,052
But for the record,
you stabbed me first.

365
00:24:10,373 --> 00:24:12,337
If you two are quite done,

366
00:24:12,414 --> 00:24:14,754
we are actually here for Barbara.

367
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:18,332
Or more precisely,
what she stole from us.

368
00:24:18,381 --> 00:24:20,777
I don't know what this is about,
and I don't care.

369
00:24:20,802 --> 00:24:22,267
You two need to get
out of here right now.

370
00:24:22,292 --> 00:24:23,711
Gladly.

371
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:25,141
Just as soon as Barbara

372
00:24:25,196 --> 00:24:28,081
gives us the... What's it called?

373
00:24:28,142 --> 00:24:29,832
- Pressure regulator valve.
- Right.

374
00:24:29,918 --> 00:24:31,323
That.

375
00:24:32,847 --> 00:24:35,528
I should have known that you
would try to screw us over.

376
00:24:35,622 --> 00:24:39,232
You only noticed because you
tried to screw me over first.

377
00:24:39,318 --> 00:24:41,013
Second, technically.

378
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,075
Okay, she's in the middle
of having a baby.

379
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:45,167
And we are in the middle of trying

380
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:47,665
to leave Gotham, and we can't do that

381
00:24:47,711 --> 00:24:50,028
without a crucial part of the submarine

382
00:24:50,105 --> 00:24:52,360
which will ferry us all away from here!

383
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:53,563
That's why you were in such a rush

384
00:24:53,607 --> 00:24:55,863
- to get out of here.
- As are we.

385
00:24:58,632 --> 00:25:01,892
Hand over the part... now.

386
00:25:02,007 --> 00:25:03,881
Don't point that at the baby.

387
00:25:03,952 --> 00:25:06,678
What? No, I did not!

388
00:25:06,732 --> 00:25:10,551
I... I was merely trying
to make a general

389
00:25:10,613 --> 00:25:11,930
threatening gesture with a firearm.

390
00:25:11,988 --> 00:25:13,567
But you did, though.
You pointed the gun at the baby.

391
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:17,713
All right, fine. I'm sorry!
Now give us what we want!

392
00:25:17,783 --> 00:25:20,361
No! You think I'm stupid
enough to have the part on me?

393
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,468
It's hidden away, somewhere safe.

394
00:25:22,545 --> 00:25:25,972
And if you think you can torture
me into telling you where,

395
00:25:26,049 --> 00:25:28,474
there is literally nothing more painful

396
00:25:28,541 --> 00:25:31,466
than what I am going through right now!

397
00:25:36,355 --> 00:25:39,485
Hey, you stay out of here.
This is a hospital.

398
00:25:45,824 --> 00:25:47,837
<i>Barbara Kean,</i>

399
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:50,736
<i>your time is up.</i>

400
00:25:50,829 --> 00:25:53,041
<i>There's no place for you to hide.</i>

401
00:25:53,767 --> 00:25:57,636
<i>No one will save you.
Nor mercy that will spare you.</i>

402
00:25:57,925 --> 00:26:01,883
<i>You simply cannot run from your sins.</i>

403
00:26:01,959 --> 00:26:04,453
<i>And you cannot run from me.</i>

404
00:26:15,593 --> 00:26:17,445
What do you want from me?

405
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:25,665
Let me let you in
on a little military secret.

406
00:26:26,868 --> 00:26:30,870
It's called Special Order 386.

407
00:26:30,954 --> 00:26:35,382
In the event that Gotham
is irretrievably lost,

408
00:26:35,484 --> 00:26:38,085
a contingency plan was put in place

409
00:26:38,125 --> 00:26:41,194
to reduce the city to rubble.

410
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:45,315
No.

411
00:26:45,403 --> 00:26:47,543
There are still innocent people here.

412
00:26:47,629 --> 00:26:50,645
You asked me what I want from you.

413
00:26:51,726 --> 00:26:55,729
I want you to suffer, Bruce Wayne.

414
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:59,190
And then I want you to die.

415
00:27:01,823 --> 00:27:05,221
Spend a little time with that thought.

416
00:27:06,844 --> 00:27:09,061
We'll be starting soon.

417
00:27:16,241 --> 00:27:18,709
- Who are those guys?
- No idea.

418
00:27:18,787 --> 00:27:21,097
Exactly how many people
have you screwed over?

419
00:27:21,168 --> 00:27:23,427
Present company excluded.

420
00:27:23,489 --> 00:27:25,536
There are 79 people in this building.

421
00:27:25,607 --> 00:27:27,568
Well, fortunately, they seem
to only be trying to kill one.

422
00:27:27,638 --> 00:27:30,238
So, by all means,
let's gather 'round the target.

423
00:27:30,283 --> 00:27:31,407
All right.

424
00:27:31,472 --> 00:27:33,082
Maybe we can cut through
the abandoned wing

425
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:35,097
and we can get
to the ambulance bay that way.

426
00:27:35,183 --> 00:27:36,247
Might take some time, but...

427
00:27:36,317 --> 00:27:37,684
Oh, if only there were
two able-bodied men

428
00:27:37,751 --> 00:27:39,084
who could buy us some.

429
00:27:39,153 --> 00:27:41,439
And why, pray tell, should we
risk our necks for you?

430
00:27:41,517 --> 00:27:44,009
Chivalry?

431
00:27:44,096 --> 00:27:46,227
But if that's too much,
remember, if I die,

432
00:27:46,282 --> 00:27:48,235
you will never find that sub part.

433
00:27:48,313 --> 00:27:51,518
Fine. We'll keep them busy.

434
00:27:51,579 --> 00:27:54,564
- We'll meet you at the docks.
- Thank you.

435
00:27:59,165 --> 00:28:00,945
- What?
- Keep them busy?

436
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:03,664
I only brought enough ammunition
for a light firefight,

437
00:28:03,741 --> 00:28:06,306
not to repel a paramilitary assault.

438
00:28:06,369 --> 00:28:08,912
What should we use, bedpans?

439
00:28:09,011 --> 00:28:10,382
I was actually thinking of something

440
00:28:10,469 --> 00:28:13,296
a little more... flammable.

441
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:51,756
Why, Captain Gordon,
how nice that you're awake.

442
00:28:52,623 --> 00:28:55,217
You picked the losing side, Strange.

443
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,540
The army's coming to Gotham.

444
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:01,524
Help me, and you can do
what you do best:

445
00:29:01,726 --> 00:29:03,434
survive.

446
00:29:03,738 --> 00:29:05,714
I happen to think more

447
00:29:05,766 --> 00:29:08,437
of Ms. al Ghul's chances for success

448
00:29:08,514 --> 00:29:10,282
than a man in your...

449
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:11,962
well...

450
00:29:12,017 --> 00:29:13,826
position.

451
00:29:13,903 --> 00:29:16,737
You really think
she can take on the entire army?

452
00:29:16,814 --> 00:29:18,560
As a matter of fact, I do.

453
00:29:19,724 --> 00:29:21,549
With my help.

454
00:29:22,443 --> 00:29:25,838
You are just a few modifications away

455
00:29:25,915 --> 00:29:28,508
from being a mighty soldier
in her forces.

456
00:29:28,584 --> 00:29:31,802
Not unlike your friend, Eduardo...

457
00:29:32,325 --> 00:29:36,465
I will help you to realize
your full potential,

458
00:29:36,534 --> 00:29:39,395
give you true strength.

459
00:29:39,879 --> 00:29:41,176
I'll pass.

460
00:29:41,255 --> 00:29:45,349
Consent is hardly a prerequisite.

461
00:29:45,437 --> 00:29:49,078
We will begin...

462
00:29:49,484 --> 00:29:52,039
with, uh, physical improvements.

463
00:29:55,443 --> 00:29:56,659
Sorry.

464
00:29:56,744 --> 00:29:59,823
And finish...

465
00:30:00,223 --> 00:30:04,011
with certain mental adjustments.

466
00:30:50,574 --> 00:30:51,931
Your contractions are
about a minute apart.

467
00:30:51,993 --> 00:30:53,095
We've got to get you out of here.

468
00:30:58,317 --> 00:31:00,167
Nice shot!

469
00:31:04,922 --> 00:31:06,222
Keep breathing.

470
00:32:06,358 --> 00:32:08,535
Some try to hide, some try to cheat.

471
00:32:08,598 --> 00:32:10,438
But time will let us always meet.

472
00:32:10,473 --> 00:32:11,889
What am I?

473
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,840
- Pregnant lady with a gun?
- Death.

474
00:32:13,879 --> 00:32:15,660
But close enough.

475
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:18,138
So, where to now?

476
00:32:18,406 --> 00:32:20,314
Well, I believe...

477
00:32:20,408 --> 00:32:22,337
we have a sub to catch.

478
00:32:22,643 --> 00:32:25,361
How long have you had that?

479
00:32:25,431 --> 00:32:27,197
Long enough to know she'd never
let it out of her sight.

480
00:32:32,057 --> 00:32:34,691
And you stuck around long enough

481
00:32:34,792 --> 00:32:38,096
to risk both of our lives
to save Barbara's?

482
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,887
Or was it to protect Lee?

483
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:45,644
Do you want me to answer that or
do you want sail away from here?

484
00:32:45,753 --> 00:32:47,723
Bon voyage.

485
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:56,748
Oh, those bastards have
stolen the damn sub part!

486
00:32:56,834 --> 00:32:59,850
- You mean, stole it back.
- Whose side are you on?

487
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:01,857
Clearly, I'm on the
baby's side, Barbara.

488
00:33:01,937 --> 00:33:04,697
- Ooh!
- What was your plan, anyway?

489
00:33:04,781 --> 00:33:08,299
You were going to be a fugitive
with Nygma and Penguin?

490
00:33:08,362 --> 00:33:11,107
Well, I'm not exactly the stay-
at-home-and-bake-apple-pie type.

491
00:33:11,195 --> 00:33:14,506
Yeah, running off on a submarine
seemed like a great alternative.

492
00:33:18,472 --> 00:33:23,209
Barbara, you can live here.
You can have this baby here.

493
00:33:23,285 --> 00:33:25,933
Jim is not taking
the baby away from you.

494
00:33:27,524 --> 00:33:29,628
You really believe that?

495
00:33:29,667 --> 00:33:32,551
You really think Captain Jim Gordon

496
00:33:32,628 --> 00:33:35,745
is gonna let a criminal raise his kid?

497
00:33:39,773 --> 00:33:42,277
People are already shooting at my baby.

498
00:33:42,346 --> 00:33:44,335
I have to protect him...

499
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,665
or her.

500
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:49,286
I have to be strong.

501
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:52,840
Right, being strong does not
mean you have to be a criminal.

502
00:33:54,408 --> 00:33:56,209
Jim will help you.

503
00:33:57,653 --> 00:33:59,662
And so will I if you'll let me.

504
00:33:59,752 --> 00:34:01,506
Well, that's just weird.

505
00:34:01,582 --> 00:34:02,998
I know.

506
00:34:03,088 --> 00:34:06,096
Hey, baby, this is your Auntie Lee.

507
00:34:06,183 --> 00:34:08,111
Mommy tried to kill her once,
maybe twice.

508
00:34:08,163 --> 00:34:09,171
All right.

509
00:34:09,182 --> 00:34:10,400
Okay, that's enough of that.

510
00:34:10,486 --> 00:34:12,675
Come on. We got to keep moving.

511
00:34:13,689 --> 00:34:15,866
I think this is happening now.

512
00:34:41,884 --> 00:34:44,064
What's going on in there?

513
00:34:54,635 --> 00:34:57,228
This is Bruce Wayne. Can anyone read me?

514
00:35:01,354 --> 00:35:04,507
This is Bruce Wayne.
Does anyone at the GCPD read me?

515
00:35:05,624 --> 00:35:08,355
<i>This is Bruce Wayne. Can anyone read me?</i>

516
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:11,204
Bruce, it's Alfred.
Where the devil are you? Over.

517
00:35:11,399 --> 00:35:14,190
Some abandoned mansion
in North Side Park.

518
00:35:14,228 --> 00:35:15,370
- On my way.
- <i>No.</i>

519
00:35:15,464 --> 00:35:16,768
I'll get out myself.

520
00:35:16,838 --> 00:35:19,007
- I need you to get to the clinic.
- The clinic?

521
00:35:19,085 --> 00:35:21,296
<i>It's Ra's al Ghul's daughter, Alfred.</i>

522
00:35:21,382 --> 00:35:23,999
<i>She wants revenge.
She mutated Eduardo Dorrance</i>

523
00:35:24,069 --> 00:35:25,590
<i>and sent him after Barbara.</i>

524
00:35:25,666 --> 00:35:26,770
Oh, gosh.

525
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:28,598
I'll be fine.

526
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,760
I need you to get
to Barbara and the baby.

527
00:35:33,767 --> 00:35:37,205
Now, you're going to feel
a slight discomfort.

528
00:35:37,267 --> 00:35:40,888
That's the stimulant I've given
you to prepare your muscles.

529
00:35:40,964 --> 00:35:43,943
You'll need it for
what comes next, which,

530
00:35:44,949 --> 00:35:47,911
I'm afraid, is going to be excruciating.

531
00:35:59,014 --> 00:36:00,875
Do you feel that?

532
00:36:02,202 --> 00:36:03,980
Yes.

533
00:36:21,663 --> 00:36:24,360
There's that fighting spirit

534
00:36:24,453 --> 00:36:26,813
I've always admired so much.

535
00:36:26,883 --> 00:36:28,086
Now, if you'll excuse me,

536
00:36:28,157 --> 00:36:30,196
there's an alarm I must sound.

537
00:36:41,117 --> 00:36:43,283
- What the hell are you doing?
- Checking to make sure

538
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:46,286
Strange doesn't have one of
those chips in your head.

539
00:36:46,363 --> 00:36:47,688
We need to hurry up,

540
00:36:47,735 --> 00:36:49,454
get out of here
before he trips the alarm.

541
00:36:51,852 --> 00:36:53,563
Come on.

542
00:36:58,176 --> 00:37:00,599
Alfred and GCPD are
on their way to the clinic.

543
00:37:00,655 --> 00:37:02,498
- Where's Nyssa?
- I don't know.

544
00:37:02,607 --> 00:37:05,334
But she's planning on using
the military to wipe out Gotham.

545
00:37:05,382 --> 00:37:07,419
I can order them to stand down.

546
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:10,443
Then let's get you out of here.

547
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:19,160
She's beautiful.

548
00:37:19,238 --> 00:37:20,946
Congratulations.

549
00:37:21,023 --> 00:37:23,374
Hi, there.

550
00:37:23,451 --> 00:37:25,751
Guess I'm-a have figure out
what to call you.

551
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:30,423
Thank you.

552
00:37:55,655 --> 00:37:58,199
- Come on.
- Get in the car now.

553
00:37:58,257 --> 00:37:59,756
I'll hold him off.

554
00:37:59,809 --> 00:38:01,020
Alfred and I got this.

555
00:38:01,074 --> 00:38:03,454
Selina, get in the car.

556
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,548
- Selina, get back in the car!
- No.

557
00:38:05,628 --> 00:38:07,173
Go.

558
00:38:07,219 --> 00:38:09,259
Oh, my, look at you.

559
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:11,617
You're a big'un, ain't you?

560
00:38:11,694 --> 00:38:13,493
Bloody baby bully,
let's see what you got.

561
00:38:33,608 --> 00:38:35,527
Dirty bastard.

562
00:38:52,991 --> 00:38:55,137
No!

563
00:38:55,489 --> 00:38:57,322
Alfred.

564
00:38:58,683 --> 00:39:00,410
Alfred.

565
00:39:02,221 --> 00:39:04,099
Alfred.

566
00:39:06,193 --> 00:39:07,779
Somebody help!

567
00:39:09,718 --> 00:39:12,031
Somebody. Oh, no.

568
00:39:31,022 --> 00:39:33,001
A-ten-hut!

569
00:39:39,114 --> 00:39:40,914
Welcome back, General.

570
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:44,175
Get me a secure line
to the mainland now.

571
00:39:45,129 --> 00:39:47,018
Jim! Hey.

572
00:39:47,128 --> 00:39:49,830
Just got word from Lee.

573
00:39:49,908 --> 00:39:52,096
She and Barbara made it
out of the clinic okay.

574
00:39:52,742 --> 00:39:55,218
And your baby daughter, too.

575
00:39:57,229 --> 00:40:01,118
- Congratulations.
- They're going to The Sirens.

576
00:40:01,303 --> 00:40:02,977
You just had a baby girl, brother.

577
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:04,813
Say something.

578
00:40:11,113 --> 00:40:12,913
Just can't believe it.

579
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:15,187
We won, didn't we? It's over.

580
00:40:15,296 --> 00:40:18,210
We did, and she's gonna have
a better world because of it.

581
00:40:18,305 --> 00:40:21,032
She is. I promise.

582
00:40:21,095 --> 00:40:23,713
- Is Alfred with them?
- Didn't say.

583
00:40:24,104 --> 00:40:26,299
This is General Wade.

584
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:31,025
I am authorizing Special Order 386.

585
00:40:31,144 --> 00:40:32,175
No!

586
00:40:32,253 --> 00:40:34,534
Gotham City is lost.

587
00:40:34,613 --> 00:40:36,542
Begin your bombing run on my order.

588
00:40:36,597 --> 00:40:38,386
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Arrest them.

589
00:40:40,261 --> 00:40:41,675
You can't do this.

590
00:40:41,785 --> 00:40:42,907
Take them away.

591
00:40:43,459 --> 00:40:45,508
You can't do this!

592
00:40:48,519 --> 00:40:50,444
Okay, nice and slow.

593
00:41:06,148 --> 00:41:09,107
- Barbara Kean.
- Run!

594
00:41:12,885 --> 00:41:15,837
It's nice to finally meet you.

595
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:19,610
My name is Nyssa al Ghul.

596
00:41:21,702 --> 00:41:24,338
I believe you knew my father.

597
00:41:30,384 --> 00:41:32,177
I don't understand how the
general could have been chipped.

598
00:41:32,256 --> 00:41:34,591
I didn't see a scar on the
back of his neck. Did you?

599
00:41:34,677 --> 00:41:36,259
No. Strange must've hidden it.

600
00:41:36,337 --> 00:41:37,587
Nyssa let us escape.

601
00:41:37,641 --> 00:41:38,915
She knew we'd bring the general here

602
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:40,845
and do her dirty work for her.

603
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,872
What now, Jim?

604
00:41:46,946 --> 00:41:50,392
Son, if you're gonna stick a gun
in my face,

605
00:41:50,489 --> 00:41:53,411
you should at least know
you're doing it wrong.

606
00:41:56,718 --> 00:41:58,078
Come on, let's go.

607
00:42:29,574 --> 00:42:34,176
