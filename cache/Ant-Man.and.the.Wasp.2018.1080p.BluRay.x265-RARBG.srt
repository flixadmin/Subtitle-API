00:00:12,756 --> 00:00:14,725
Hopefully, it's not for long,

5
00:00:14,727 --> 00:00:16,795
but I'll call you
when we get settled.

6
00:00:16,797 --> 00:00:18,464
When I have a better
indication of what's going on.

7
00:00:18,466 --> 00:00:19,468
Mommy?

8
00:00:22,574 --> 00:00:24,143
Jellybean.

9
00:00:26,315 --> 00:00:28,920
Daddy and I have
a last-minute business trip...

10
00:00:28,922 --> 00:00:31,525
so Rose is gonna stay with you
for a few days.

11
00:00:31,527 --> 00:00:33,862
No. I don't want you to go.

12
00:00:33,864 --> 00:00:36,868
Ugh. It's gonna be so boring.

13
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,339
I won't be able to keep my...

14
00:00:38,806 --> 00:00:39,806
eyes...

15
00:00:43,516 --> 00:00:46,187
Goodbye, sweetheart.
All right, we'll see you soon.

16
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:48,559
Okay.

17
00:00:48,561 --> 00:00:50,194
Janet, we gotta go.

18
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:55,237
<i><font color="#80ffff">I wish we could have

21
00:01:04,525 --> 00:01:05,926
Oh, my God.

22
00:01:05,928 --> 00:01:07,730
They've already launched.

23
00:01:07,732 --> 00:01:08,999
We have to stop it.

24
00:01:09,001 --> 00:01:10,001
Come on.

25
00:01:19,021 --> 00:01:22,359
<i><font color="#80ffff">To disarm the missile,

29
00:01:34,051 --> 00:01:36,052
Hank.

30

<i><font color="#80ffff">We both knew

00:01:52,554 --> 00:01:53,556
<i><font color="#80ffff">She turned it off.</i></font>

36
00:01:53,956 --> 00:01:55,858
Janet. No!

37
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,664
<i><font color="#80ffff">She went subatomic

coming home...</i></font>

44

<i><font color="#80ffff">was the hardest thing
that I ever had to do.</i></font>

45
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,055
But then Scott showed up.

46
00:02:44,057 --> 00:02:47,030
Or should I say,
broke into our house.

47
00:02:48,197 --> 00:02:50,068
<i><font color="#80ffff">And when he went
to the quantum realm...</i></font>

48
00:02:53,677 --> 00:02:54,745
<i><font color="#80ffff">and came back.</i></font>

49
00:02:55,612 --> 00:02:56,949
<i><font color="#80ffff">Everything changed.</i></font>

50
00:02:59,154 --> 00:03:01,789
I started to wonder...

51
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:03,795
could your mother
still be alive?

52
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,439
So, I dusted off some old plans.

53
00:03:18,092 --> 00:03:19,928
Dad, what are you saying?

54
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:24,804
I think it's possible
to bring her back.

55
00:04:03,849 --> 00:04:05,820
Okay. We're in.

56
00:04:08,992 --> 00:04:11,295
Oh, this place is a maze.

57
00:04:11,297 --> 00:04:13,167
Where's that map?

58
00:04:16,207 --> 00:04:17,908
We're definitely close.

59
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:20,079
- You ready?
- I'm ready, Daddy.

60
00:04:20,081 --> 00:04:21,882
Are you sure?
'Cause once we're inside,

61
00:04:21,884 --> 00:04:24,052
you show any hesitation
or fear, we're done.

62
00:04:24,054 --> 00:04:26,192
I eat fear for breakfast.

63
00:04:26,194 --> 00:04:28,797
Wow. That is super cool.

64
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,900
Come on.

65
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:37,680
Look! It's Anton.
He'll show us the way.

66
00:04:37,682 --> 00:04:39,151
Anton, which way do we go?

67
00:04:42,191 --> 00:04:44,028
Anton, which way do we go?

68
00:04:51,978 --> 00:04:52,979
Thanks, Anton!

69
00:04:55,117 --> 00:04:57,954
Look, the ants have burrowed
into the tech facility.

70
00:04:57,956 --> 00:04:59,660
Oh no, lasers!

71
00:05:01,932 --> 00:05:03,836
Oh! I think I got lased!

72
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,110
The secret vault.

73
00:05:09,312 --> 00:05:11,447
Tell me you brought
the contact lens.

74
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:13,119
Yup.

75
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:17,129
Perfect! Right there.

76
00:05:21,203 --> 00:05:23,473
There!
It's the micro-treasure!

77
00:05:23,475 --> 00:05:25,843
My trophy?

78
00:05:25,845 --> 00:05:27,146
It looks like treasure.

79
00:05:27,148 --> 00:05:28,815
Oh, it is to me.

80
00:05:28,817 --> 00:05:30,153
I want to take it
to show-and-tell.

81
00:05:30,155 --> 00:05:31,288
Oh, no, you can't do that.

82
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:34,862
You can't. It never leaves
the house. It's too important.

83
00:05:34,864 --> 00:05:36,865
This is the best birthday
present you ever got me.

84
00:05:36,867 --> 00:05:38,168
I'm so touched you think

85
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:40,172
I'm the world's
greatest grandma.

86
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:41,473
It was the only one they had.

87
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:43,278
It makes me want
to knit you a sweater.

88
00:05:45,451 --> 00:05:46,851
Oh, no, the fuzz!

89
00:05:46,853 --> 00:05:48,021
Hey, Scotty...

90
00:05:48,023 --> 00:05:49,158
I was looking at the schematics

91
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,526
for the Karapetyan buildings...

92
00:05:50,528 --> 00:05:51,896
and I think we have

93
00:05:51,898 --> 00:05:53,165
way too many security cameras,
don't we?

94
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:54,500
No, no, not at all.

95
00:05:54,502 --> 00:05:55,935
I mean, 'cause it's a lot
of security cameras.

96
00:05:55,937 --> 00:05:57,307
I know what he needs.

97
00:05:57,309 --> 00:05:59,076
Who's the security expert
in our business?

98
00:05:59,078 --> 00:05:59,978
You are, but I'm running
the company, right?

99
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,047
And if we overquote him...

100
00:06:01,049 --> 00:06:02,148
he's gonna go somewhere else.

101
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,252
I mean, we gotta land this bird.

102
00:06:03,254 --> 00:06:04,521
He ain't goin' anywhere.

103
00:06:04,523 --> 00:06:06,057
And the expression is
"land this fish."

104
00:06:06,059 --> 00:06:07,459
No, it's "land the bird."

105
00:06:07,461 --> 00:06:08,829
Just like you land the plane.

106
00:06:08,831 --> 00:06:10,064
You gotta land the plane
to be in business.

107
00:06:10,066 --> 00:06:11,268
I know it's silly to get hung up

108
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,903
on these kinds of things,
but I do.

109
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:14,273
How am I gonna land a fish?

110
00:06:14,275 --> 00:06:16,276
It can't walk.
And if it swam up on shore...

111
00:06:16,278 --> 00:06:18,915
and it battled a hawk,
who's gonna win?

112
00:06:18,917 --> 00:06:21,353
You've really turned me around
on this thing.

113
00:06:21,355 --> 00:06:23,324
It's okay.
We're gonna land Karapetyan.

114
00:06:23,326 --> 00:06:24,627
Now, if you just excuse me...

115
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:25,896
I'm in the middle of trying to

116
00:06:25,898 --> 00:06:27,031
steal something
with my daughter.

117
00:06:27,033 --> 00:06:28,168
I'm gonna go recheck it.

118
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:30,374
To the escape ant!

119
00:06:31,877 --> 00:06:34,881
Let's bounce
before the po-po come back!

120
00:06:34,883 --> 00:06:37,920
The po-po?
How do you even know that?

121
00:06:37,922 --> 00:06:39,523
Let's fly, Antoinette!
Let's fly!

122
00:06:50,648 --> 00:06:52,348
Crash landing!

123
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,550
Whoo!

124
00:06:56,158 --> 00:06:57,559
I wish we could shrink for real.

125
00:06:57,561 --> 00:06:59,697
Oh. That is pretty cool.

126
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:01,500
Hey, I'm headed
to the office, Scotty.

127
00:07:01,502 --> 00:07:02,937
And sorry about freaking out
earlier, you know.

128
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:04,271
But I feel like I'm way better.

129
00:07:04,273 --> 00:07:06,375
My heart is definitely beating
way too hard and stuff.

130
00:07:06,377 --> 00:07:07,512
And my hands are shaking.

131
00:07:07,514 --> 00:07:09,115
But I think it's unrelated,
you know?

132
00:07:09,117 --> 00:07:10,319
It's gonna be great, Luis!

133
00:07:10,321 --> 00:07:11,420
You got nothing to worry about!

134
00:07:11,422 --> 00:07:14,293
Yeah, yeah. I'm the boss.
I'm the boss.

135
00:07:14,295 --> 00:07:15,394
I'm the boss.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

136
00:07:15,396 --> 00:07:16,665
Daddy!

137
00:07:22,377 --> 00:07:25,081
Come on, Woo!
I've got three days left.

138
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,449
Why would I try to escape?

139
00:07:26,451 --> 00:07:28,521
Sorry, Scott,
but rules are rules.

140
00:07:28,523 --> 00:07:29,992
You trip the perimeter alarm,
we search the place.

141
00:07:29,994 --> 00:07:32,096
Keel to stern, soup to nuts.

142
00:07:32,098 --> 00:07:33,596
Thank you.

143
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:36,069
It was an accident. My foot
went through the fence.

144
00:07:36,071 --> 00:07:38,208
Our flying ant crashed.

145
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:39,608
Hey, you try and entertain
a 10-year-old

146
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,012
when you can't leave the house.

147
00:07:41,014 --> 00:07:43,083
You know the lengths
that I've gone to?

148
00:07:44,288 --> 00:07:45,723
Close-up magic.

149
00:07:49,032 --> 00:07:50,665
I learned that.

150
00:07:50,667 --> 00:07:52,371
Why can't you just leave
my daddy alone?

151
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,110
Oh, Cassie.

152
00:07:56,112 --> 00:07:58,180
This must all seem like
a bunch of confusing

153
00:07:58,182 --> 00:08:00,050
grown-up stuff to you, huh?

154
00:08:00,052 --> 00:08:01,653
Well, think of it this way.

155
00:08:01,655 --> 00:08:03,458
Your school has rules, right?

156
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,560
Like, you can't draw
on the walls.

157
00:08:05,562 --> 00:08:07,564
Well, your daddy went to Germany

158
00:08:07,566 --> 00:08:09,668
and drew on the walls
with Captain America.

159
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:12,309
And that was a violation
of Article 16,

160
00:08:12,311 --> 00:08:14,379
Paragraph Three
of the Sokovia Accords.

161
00:08:14,381 --> 00:08:16,516
Now, as a part of
his joint plea deal...

162
00:08:16,518 --> 00:08:18,754
with Homeland Security
and the German government...

163
00:08:18,756 --> 00:08:20,624
he was allowed to return
to the U.S...

164
00:08:20,626 --> 00:08:23,262
provided he serve two years
under house arrest...

165
00:08:23,264 --> 00:08:25,166
followed by three years
of probation.

166
00:08:25,168 --> 00:08:28,139
And avoid any unauthorized
activities, technology...

167
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:30,411
or contact with any
former associates who were...

168
00:08:30,413 --> 00:08:33,617
or currently are
in violation of said Accords.

169
00:08:33,619 --> 00:08:35,186
Or any related statutes.

170
00:08:35,188 --> 00:08:36,424
Okay, sweetie?

171
00:08:37,527 --> 00:08:40,296
Wow. You're really great
with kids.

172
00:08:40,298 --> 00:08:42,569
Thanks.
I'm also a youth pastor.

173
00:08:42,571 --> 00:08:44,872
Anyway, not to be
a Johnny ask-a-lot...

174
00:08:44,874 --> 00:08:46,444
but you haven't had any contact

175
00:08:46,446 --> 00:08:47,878
with Hank Pym or Hope Van Dyne,
have you?

176
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,717
- No.
- You sure?

177
00:08:49,719 --> 00:08:51,786
Because it's only a matter of time
before we get 'em.

178
00:08:51,788 --> 00:08:54,425
It was their tech, so they
violated the Accords, too.

179
00:08:54,427 --> 00:08:57,430
And associating with them
breaks your deal.

180
00:08:57,432 --> 00:08:59,737
And, uh, I don't need
to remind you...

181
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:01,540
that any violation
of your agreement

182
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:03,577
means 20 years in prison.
Minimum.

183
00:09:03,579 --> 00:09:05,881
I haven't talked to Hank
or Hope in forever.

184
00:09:05,883 --> 00:09:06,851
They hate his guts.

185
00:09:06,853 --> 00:09:07,855
Thanks, peanut.

186
00:09:09,859 --> 00:09:11,194
How'd you do it, Scott?

187
00:09:11,695 --> 00:09:12,729
Do what?

188
00:09:13,933 --> 00:09:15,870
The card trick.

189
00:09:16,538 --> 00:09:17,538
Seriously?

190
00:09:17,908 --> 00:09:20,242
Oh, my God!

191
00:09:20,244 --> 00:09:22,614
You people
can't just show up here

192
00:09:22,616 --> 00:09:23,885
whenever you want
and search the place.

193
00:09:23,887 --> 00:09:24,987
Actually, they can.

194
00:09:24,989 --> 00:09:26,255
You need a warrant.

195
00:09:26,257 --> 00:09:27,457
Actually, they don't.

196
00:09:27,459 --> 00:09:29,595
Really? Wow.

197
00:09:29,597 --> 00:09:31,399
Did you pack your soccer shoes?

198
00:09:31,401 --> 00:09:34,271
- Yeah.
- All right.

199
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:36,575
Next time I see you will be
on the outside.

200
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:38,613
All right.

201
00:09:38,615 --> 00:09:40,315
Oh, get on the inside of this.

202
00:09:41,553 --> 00:09:43,422
Hey, three days.
Seriously...

203
00:09:43,424 --> 00:09:44,691
- I'm proud of you, bud.
- Thank you.

204
00:09:44,693 --> 00:09:46,027
You know what?
Give me another one.

205
00:09:46,029 --> 00:09:48,465
Me too!
Gosh! Freedom!

206
00:09:48,467 --> 00:09:51,039
New business!
I am sensing greatness.

207
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:52,775
I had a fun weekend, Daddy.

208
00:09:52,777 --> 00:09:54,878
Me too, peanut. But just wait
till next weekend.

209
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,517
Once I'm outta here, you and I are
gonna go paint this town red.

210
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,656
We'll have so much ice cream,
we'll never stop puking.

211
00:10:08,073 --> 00:10:09,608
You're gettin' good at that.

212
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:10,678
How'd you do that?

213
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,080
- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye.

214
00:10:13,618 --> 00:10:15,254
- Bye.
- Bye.

215
00:10:18,796 --> 00:10:20,364
Three days.

216
00:10:20,764 --> 00:10:22,367
Easy-peasy.

217
00:10:30,719 --> 00:10:33,556
<i><font color=Lime>♪ Snap your fingers. That gets

222
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:17,545

228
00:11:53,551 --> 00:11:55,619
I'm gonna find you, Jellybean.

229
00:12:01,099 --> 00:12:02,766
I found you!

230
00:12:02,768 --> 00:12:05,739
You always find me, Mommy.

231
00:12:05,741 --> 00:12:07,644
<i><font color="#80ffff">What the hell?</i></font>

232
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:25,813
Hey, Hank!
It's been a while.

233
00:12:25,815 --> 00:12:29,686
Um, I don't even know if
this is your number anymore.

234
00:12:29,688 --> 00:12:30,922
And I'm probably the last person

235
00:12:30,924 --> 00:12:32,293
you wanna hear from.

236
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:35,967
But I just had
a really weird dream.

237
00:12:35,969 --> 00:12:37,169
And I know that doesn't

238
00:12:37,171 --> 00:12:38,305
sound like an emergency
or anything...

239
00:12:38,307 --> 00:12:43,281
but it just felt very real.

240
00:12:43,283 --> 00:12:46,287
I was back
in the quantum realm...

241
00:12:46,289 --> 00:12:49,661
and I think I saw your wife.

242
00:12:49,663 --> 00:12:51,796
And then I was your wife.

243
00:12:51,798 --> 00:12:54,638
I mean, not in a weird way
or anything.

244
00:12:56,808 --> 00:12:59,179
You know, hearing this out loud,

245
00:12:59,181 --> 00:13:01,718
I'm thinking, uh,
it's not an emergency.

246
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,724
I'm sorry to bother you.

247
00:13:04,991 --> 00:13:07,163
I'm sorry for a lot of things.

248
00:13:16,382 --> 00:13:19,719
<i><font color="#80ffff">That means, one tiny atom
in my fingernail could be...</i></font>

249
00:13:20,825 --> 00:13:24,864
<i><font color="#80ffff">Could be one,
little, tiny universe.</i></font>

250
00:13:58,799 --> 00:13:59,801
Hope?

251
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,776
Is this another dream?

252
00:14:03,778 --> 00:14:04,978
Do you think it was a dream...

253
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,384
or is it possible that you
really saw my mom down there?

254
00:14:08,085 --> 00:14:09,754
I'm not sure.

255
00:14:13,263 --> 00:14:14,829
I can't be here!

256
00:14:14,831 --> 00:14:16,534
I can't be here!
I'm under house arrest!

257
00:14:16,536 --> 00:14:19,172
They won't open while
the system's engaged, Scott.

258
00:14:39,114 --> 00:14:42,117
You have to take me home.
They could show up any second!

259
00:14:42,119 --> 00:14:43,319
Relax. As far as your
nanny cops know,

260
00:14:43,321 --> 00:14:44,321
you're still at home.

261
00:14:51,071 --> 00:14:52,406
Whoa!

262
00:14:58,252 --> 00:14:59,487
Scotty?

263
00:14:59,489 --> 00:15:01,390
<i><font color="#80ffff">He's programmed to
replicate your daily routine.</i></font>

264
00:15:01,392 --> 00:15:03,126
Nine hours in bed.

265
00:15:03,128 --> 00:15:04,428
Five hours in front of the TV.

266
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:06,532
Two hours in the bathroom,
whatever that's about.

267
00:15:06,534 --> 00:15:08,303
That's totally inaccurate.

268
00:15:08,305 --> 00:15:10,007
And how do you know
about my daily routine?

269
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:11,007
Are you spying on me?

270
00:15:11,009 --> 00:15:13,045
We keep tabs on all
security threats, all right?

271
00:15:13,047 --> 00:15:14,917
And so far the biggest one
we've had is you.

272
00:15:18,158 --> 00:15:20,962
I'm sorry about Germany.
They just showed up.

273
00:15:20,964 --> 00:15:22,498
They said it was
a matter of national security.

274
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,135
That Cap needed help, so...

275
00:15:24,137 --> 00:15:25,171
Cap?

276
00:15:26,239 --> 00:15:29,411
Tain America.
Captain. Cap.

277
00:15:29,413 --> 00:15:31,482
It's what we call him.

278
00:15:31,484 --> 00:15:33,218
If you're a friend.

279
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,321
I'm not saying I'm a friend
of... A little, I know him.

280
00:15:34,323 --> 00:15:36,191
He's nice. Whatever.

281
00:15:36,193 --> 00:15:38,662
I'm sorry! All right?
I didn't think I'd get caught.

282
00:15:38,664 --> 00:15:40,184
You didn't think
about a lot of things.

283
00:15:41,403 --> 00:15:43,138
How's Hank?

284
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,075
We're still running. The house
is gone, so is our freedom.

285
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:46,478
How do you think he is?

286
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,483
I'm sorry.
I know you're mad.

287
00:15:48,485 --> 00:15:50,085
I'm not looking
for an apology, Scott.

288
00:15:50,087 --> 00:15:51,689
The only reason
why we're even talking is...

289
00:15:51,691 --> 00:15:53,293
because we need
what's in your head.

290
00:16:32,306 --> 00:16:35,108
Is this where you're living?

291
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:38,650
If you need help or money
or something, maybe I can...

292
00:16:38,652 --> 00:16:40,252
We're fine.

293
00:17:37,367 --> 00:17:39,304
Hey, Hank.
Look, I just wanna...

294
00:17:39,905 --> 00:17:41,307
Save it!

295
00:17:44,683 --> 00:17:45,851
- Can we start?
- Yeah.

296
00:17:47,287 --> 00:17:49,490
So, while you were relaxing
at home...

297
00:17:49,492 --> 00:17:51,897
we were building this.

298
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:54,836
It's a tunnel.
To the quantum realm.

299
00:17:55,905 --> 00:17:57,472
To my mom.

300
00:17:57,474 --> 00:17:58,574
We think she might still
be down there.

301
00:17:58,576 --> 00:17:59,477
We just don't know where.

302
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:01,380
What?

303
00:18:01,382 --> 00:18:03,552
If we can pinpoint
my mom's location...

304
00:18:03,554 --> 00:18:05,655
then the pod can take me down
to get her.

305
00:18:05,657 --> 00:18:06,791
You built all this
and you don't even know

306
00:18:06,793 --> 00:18:08,361
if she's alive?

307
00:18:08,363 --> 00:18:10,431
It's called a hypothesis.

308
00:18:10,433 --> 00:18:13,336
Last night, we powered up
the tunnel for the first time.

309
00:18:13,338 --> 00:18:15,609
It was overloaded
and it shut down.

310
00:18:15,611 --> 00:18:17,313
But for a split second,

311
00:18:17,315 --> 00:18:19,852
the doorway to the
quantum realm was opened.

312
00:18:20,954 --> 00:18:22,122
And?

313
00:18:22,124 --> 00:18:25,262
And five minutes later,
you called, talking about Mom.

314
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,465
We think
when you were down there,

315
00:18:27,467 --> 00:18:29,001
you may have entangled with her.

316
00:18:29,003 --> 00:18:31,007
Hank, I would never do that.
I respect you too much.

317
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:33,577
Quantum entanglement, Scott.

318
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:34,881
We think she might have put

319
00:18:34,883 --> 00:18:36,049
some kind of a message
in your head.

320
00:18:36,051 --> 00:18:38,020
Hopefully, a location.

321
00:18:38,022 --> 00:18:39,824
And opening the tunnel
triggered it.

322
00:18:39,826 --> 00:18:41,695
Your mom put a message
in my head?

323
00:18:41,697 --> 00:18:43,464
Come on. That's insane.

324
00:18:43,466 --> 00:18:44,700
No, Scott.

325
00:18:44,702 --> 00:18:47,105
Insane is going to Germany

326
00:18:47,107 --> 00:18:49,642
without telling us,
and fighting the Avengers.

327
00:18:49,644 --> 00:18:52,717
Just tell me you weren't lying
about the suit you took.

328
00:18:52,719 --> 00:18:55,889
Tell me you really destroyed it.

329
00:18:55,891 --> 00:18:58,059
I did, I destroyed it, I swear.

330
00:18:58,061 --> 00:18:59,931
I can't believe
you destroyed my suit!

331
00:19:00,901 --> 00:19:02,803
That was my life's work!

332
00:19:02,805 --> 00:19:04,038
What was I supposed to do?

333
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,945
You were supposed to not
take my suit!

334
00:19:06,947 --> 00:19:08,113
I'm sorry, Hank!

335
00:19:08,115 --> 00:19:09,749
I'm sorry I took the suit.

336
00:19:09,751 --> 00:19:12,122
I'm sorry
that I called last night.

337
00:19:12,124 --> 00:19:13,924
I don't remember
seeing Janet down there.

338
00:19:13,926 --> 00:19:15,429
I wish that I did.

339
00:19:15,431 --> 00:19:16,331
I just had a dream about her

340
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:17,933
playing hide-and-seek
with a little girl.

341
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,410
What?

342
00:19:24,948 --> 00:19:26,785
I had a dream.

343
00:19:26,787 --> 00:19:29,590
She was playing hide-and-seek
with a little girl.

344
00:19:29,592 --> 00:19:31,459
Cassie and I do it all the time.

345
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:32,862
Doesn't mean anything.

346
00:19:32,864 --> 00:19:34,801
But was it Cassie in the dream?

347
00:19:34,803 --> 00:19:36,068
No.

348
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,539
Where was she hiding?

349
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:39,074
- What?
- The little girl.

350
00:19:39,076 --> 00:19:40,913
Where was she hiding?
Was it in a wardrobe?

351
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:44,554
No, it was in a tall dresser.

352
00:19:44,556 --> 00:19:45,854
You mean a wardrobe.

353
00:19:45,856 --> 00:19:47,157
Is that what that's called?

354
00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:48,628
What color was it?

355
00:19:49,466 --> 00:19:50,466
Red.

356
00:19:52,636 --> 00:19:53,938
Were there horses on it?

357
00:19:54,474 --> 00:19:55,609
Oh, boy.

358
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:59,649
It's where I hid
every time that we played.

359
00:20:00,219 --> 00:20:01,620
It doesn't sound like

360
00:20:01,622 --> 00:20:03,459
you really got the gist
of the game.

361
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:06,664
She's alive.

362
00:20:08,635 --> 00:20:10,070
I knew it.

363
00:20:10,974 --> 00:20:12,142
I knew it!

364
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:15,247
We need to get that part.

365
00:20:15,249 --> 00:20:16,616
Okay.

366
00:20:18,856 --> 00:20:20,289
The sooner we get
the tunnel working...

367
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:21,692
the sooner we can get
this message out of his head.

368
00:20:21,694 --> 00:20:23,064
Does Burch have it?

369
00:20:23,066 --> 00:20:24,565
- Yeah. Let's go.
- What part?

370
00:20:24,567 --> 00:20:26,504
Who's Burch?
Wait. What's happening?

371
00:20:28,142 --> 00:20:29,743
We need a component
to stop the tunnel

372
00:20:29,745 --> 00:20:31,313
from overloading again.

373
00:20:31,315 --> 00:20:33,853
I grabbed your clothes.
You might want to change.

374
00:20:43,337 --> 00:20:45,075
Look, I'd really like
to help you...

375
00:20:46,344 --> 00:20:47,711
but if I'm not at home
when they come

376
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:48,913
to take off my ankle monitor...

377
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:50,350
then I'm going away forever.

378
00:20:50,352 --> 00:20:52,689
Once we get the component
and power up the tunnel...

379
00:20:52,691 --> 00:20:54,692
we'll get the message,
and have you home by lunch.

380
00:20:54,694 --> 00:20:56,830
We have to hurry.
The entanglement won't last.

381
00:20:56,832 --> 00:20:58,700
You owe us.

382
00:20:58,702 --> 00:21:00,705
All right, fine.
But can I just wait inside?

383
00:21:00,707 --> 00:21:02,267
Because I'm not supposed
to be out here.

384
00:21:12,162 --> 00:21:13,297
Let's go.

385
00:21:30,932 --> 00:21:32,834
- We good?
- Yeah.

386
00:21:32,836 --> 00:21:34,204
I'll be right back.

387
00:21:41,755 --> 00:21:44,190
- Can I have one of these?
- No.

388
00:21:58,054 --> 00:22:01,424
Ah. Susan! Welcome to 'Oui'!

389
00:22:01,426 --> 00:22:03,228
Sonny!

390
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:05,432
'Oui' is French
for "yes."

391
00:22:05,434 --> 00:22:07,772
As in "yes" to farm-to-table,
"yes" to locally sourced...

392
00:22:07,774 --> 00:22:10,145
and "yes" to planet
before profit.

393
00:22:11,314 --> 00:22:13,180
Well, let's hope
it also means "yes"

394
00:22:13,182 --> 00:22:14,782
to "Do you have the component
I ordered?"

395
00:22:17,226 --> 00:22:19,393
You know, I have always loved
your sense of humor, Susan.

396
00:22:19,395 --> 00:22:20,764
Have a seat.

397
00:22:20,766 --> 00:22:21,498
No, I'm good. Thank you.

398
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,369
Who is this guy?

399
00:22:23,371 --> 00:22:27,009
Sonny Burch. He traffics
in black market technology.

400
00:22:27,011 --> 00:22:29,131
He's been getting us what
we need to build the tunnel.

401
00:22:31,287 --> 00:22:32,520
Could I just have one...

402
00:22:32,522 --> 00:22:34,792
No.

403
00:22:34,794 --> 00:22:37,899
You know, I have
a special friend at the FBI.

404
00:22:37,901 --> 00:22:39,232
And I say "special"...

405
00:22:39,234 --> 00:22:42,106
because, well,
he tells me things

406
00:22:42,108 --> 00:22:43,778
that I didn't previously know.

407
00:22:44,413 --> 00:22:46,181
For example...

408
00:22:46,183 --> 00:22:48,151
your name isn't Susan.

409
00:22:48,153 --> 00:22:51,091
It's Hope Van Dyne.

410
00:22:51,093 --> 00:22:54,198
And your unseen associate,
that's your father, Hank Pym.

411
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,136
- That's not good, Hank.
- No shit.

412
00:23:03,918 --> 00:23:06,087
What do you want?

413
00:23:06,089 --> 00:23:08,424
Relationships
are built on trust, Hope.

414
00:23:08,426 --> 00:23:10,629
And I want our relationship
to have a strong foundation.

415
00:23:10,631 --> 00:23:12,266
Our relationship?

416
00:23:12,268 --> 00:23:15,206
My business landscape
has been shifting, Hope.

417
00:23:15,208 --> 00:23:16,941
Hell, S.H.I.E.L.D. and HYDRA
don't even exist anymore...

418
00:23:16,943 --> 00:23:19,247
but now, Hank Pym...

419
00:23:19,249 --> 00:23:21,516
Hank Pym is a real opportunity.

420
00:23:21,518 --> 00:23:22,953
Do you have a point?

421
00:23:22,955 --> 00:23:24,222
Oh, you think that I don't know

422
00:23:24,224 --> 00:23:26,562
what you've been building
with all this?

423
00:23:26,564 --> 00:23:29,267
Quantum technology.

424
00:23:29,269 --> 00:23:31,905
Now, you can forget nanotech,
forget AI,

425
00:23:31,907 --> 00:23:33,041
forget cryptocurrency.

426
00:23:33,043 --> 00:23:34,978
Quantum energy is the future.

427
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,648
It's the next gold rush.

428
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:37,615
Is that so?

429
00:23:37,617 --> 00:23:39,587
I want in, Hope.

430
00:23:39,589 --> 00:23:42,227
So, as a gesture of good will,
I have taken the liberty...

431
00:23:42,229 --> 00:23:44,098
of arranging some buyers
for your lab.

432
00:23:44,933 --> 00:23:45,933
Starting bid...

433
00:23:46,537 --> 00:23:49,975
one billion dollars.

434
00:23:49,977 --> 00:23:51,545
Thank you, Sonny, really.

435
00:23:51,547 --> 00:23:53,047
But my father and I
have something

436
00:23:53,049 --> 00:23:55,420
slightly more pressing
than starting a business.

437
00:23:55,422 --> 00:23:58,726
So I'll just take
the component as arranged.

438
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:00,932
My buyers don't take
no for an answer.

439
00:24:02,301 --> 00:24:04,269
So, we are either
in business together...

440
00:24:04,271 --> 00:24:06,576
or we aren't
in business together.

441
00:24:09,682 --> 00:24:11,584
Then I guess we aren't.

442
00:24:11,586 --> 00:24:14,289
You can go.

443
00:24:14,291 --> 00:24:17,095
But I'm afraid your money's
gonna have to remain.

444
00:24:17,097 --> 00:24:19,434
Let's call it compensation
for my injured feelings.

445
00:24:20,269 --> 00:24:22,138
Listen, Sonny.

446
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,777
This is gonna be
so much easier on everybody

447
00:24:24,779 --> 00:24:26,480
if you just give me
that component.

448
00:24:26,482 --> 00:24:28,551
Darlin', the only thing
you're takin' from here...

449
00:24:28,553 --> 00:24:32,160
is my heart,
but it will mend in time.

450
00:24:33,596 --> 00:24:34,965
Okay.

451
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:44,817
So, now what?

452
00:24:44,819 --> 00:24:47,220
You'll see.

453
00:24:47,222 --> 00:24:49,159
She said her and her daddy
had something pressing.

454
00:24:49,161 --> 00:24:50,326
- Mmm-hmm.
- I want to know what it is

455
00:24:50,328 --> 00:24:51,363
because if they're not
working with us...

456
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:52,801
they're working with somebody.
So find out.

457
00:24:52,803 --> 00:24:54,201
I want some names...

458
00:24:58,815 --> 00:25:00,417
Hold on, you gave her wings?

459
00:25:06,628 --> 00:25:07,630
Get her.

460
00:25:24,265 --> 00:25:25,745
Not my turn-of-the-century
chandelier!

461
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:31,746
Stop firing! Stop!

462
00:25:36,521 --> 00:25:37,961
All right, take this.
Go. Go, go, go!

463
00:25:38,492 --> 00:25:39,492
Go!

464
00:26:42,018 --> 00:26:43,956
Wings and blasters.

465
00:26:43,958 --> 00:26:45,891
So I take it you didn't have
that tech available for me.

466
00:26:45,893 --> 00:26:46,893
No, I did.

467
00:26:48,932 --> 00:26:51,637
It was a pleasure doing
business with you, Sonny.

468
00:26:51,639 --> 00:26:54,342
Oh, our business
isn't finished yet, Hope.

469
00:26:54,344 --> 00:26:55,578
I can assure you of that!

470
00:27:03,028 --> 00:27:04,897
What in the hell is that?

471
00:27:18,992 --> 00:27:20,494
Dad, are you seeing this?

472
00:27:20,496 --> 00:27:21,498
Hope, get out of there!

473
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:31,584
- I gotta do something.
- Wait!

474
00:27:37,396 --> 00:27:40,402
It is still a work in progress.

475
00:27:59,072 --> 00:28:00,172
You taught me
that kick. Remember?

476
00:28:00,174 --> 00:28:01,743
Yeah, great form.

477
00:28:01,745 --> 00:28:03,679
Those were the days.
Whatever happened to us?

478
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:05,115
Not the time, Scott.

479
00:28:05,117 --> 00:28:06,119
Damn it, where'd it go?

480
00:28:09,125 --> 00:28:10,227
I've lost it.

481
00:28:10,229 --> 00:28:12,095
<i><font color="#80ffff">I'm not seeing anything
on the ant cams.</i></font>

482
00:28:12,097 --> 00:28:14,034
<i><font color="#80ffff">Try looking...</i></font>

483
00:28:14,036 --> 00:28:15,037
Dad?

484
00:28:23,721 --> 00:28:25,556
Give me that.

485
00:28:25,558 --> 00:28:26,560
Now.

486
00:28:30,803 --> 00:28:32,170
- Are you okay?
- No!

487
00:28:32,172 --> 00:28:33,238
He got the lab.

488
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,641
No.

489
00:28:34,643 --> 00:28:35,645
Come on!

490
00:28:38,084 --> 00:28:39,217
What was that?

491
00:28:39,219 --> 00:28:40,821
I don't know.

492
00:28:40,823 --> 00:28:42,757
But we need to find somewhere
to regroup

493
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:44,595
and figure out where the lab is.

494
00:28:45,163 --> 00:28:46,932
So, where to now?

495
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:48,736
How about my house? Hmm?

496
00:28:48,738 --> 00:28:49,905
I'm supposed to be there anyway,

497
00:28:49,907 --> 00:28:51,107
and Woo could walk in
any second.

498
00:28:51,109 --> 00:28:53,278
Exactly why we're not going
to your house.

499
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,682
What about your house?

500
00:28:55,818 --> 00:28:57,720
Sorry.

501
00:28:57,722 --> 00:29:00,228
Well, there is one place
I can think of.

502
00:29:01,162 --> 00:29:02,163
No.

503
00:29:02,798 --> 00:29:05,036
No, no, no, no!

504
00:29:06,775 --> 00:29:07,776
No!

505
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:12,750
Wow, Dr. Pym...

506
00:29:12,752 --> 00:29:14,153
who would've thought that,

507
00:29:14,155 --> 00:29:15,622
once again,
in your hour of need...

508
00:29:15,624 --> 00:29:17,759
that you would turn to us,
you know?

509
00:29:17,761 --> 00:29:18,763
Not me.

510
00:29:19,066 --> 00:29:21,301
Mmm. Help yourself.

511
00:29:21,303 --> 00:29:22,369
Hey, what's up
with the fancy pastry?

512
00:29:22,371 --> 00:29:24,039
We gotta keep
the food budget down.

513
00:29:24,041 --> 00:29:26,010
Well, what are we supposed
to have for breakfast?

514
00:29:26,012 --> 00:29:26,979
The oatmeal packets.

515
00:29:26,981 --> 00:29:28,949
Oatmeal packets.

516
00:29:28,951 --> 00:29:30,686
- It's insult.
- Why is it an insult?

517
00:29:30,688 --> 00:29:31,854
Because it tastes like sand.

518
00:29:31,856 --> 00:29:33,324
You know why?
'Cause it's organic.

519
00:29:33,326 --> 00:29:34,794
It's not organic, it's sand.

520
00:29:34,796 --> 00:29:35,830
It's the most important meal
of the day.

521
00:29:35,832 --> 00:29:36,864
You know what,
you can get creative with it.

522
00:29:36,866 --> 00:29:38,134
Break teeth.

523
00:29:38,136 --> 00:29:39,003
Put a little brown sugar on it.
You can put some cinnamon.

524
00:29:39,005 --> 00:29:39,805
Put a little honey.
Whatever you want...

525
00:29:39,807 --> 00:29:43,645
Guys, guys, guys.
Come on, man.

526
00:29:43,647 --> 00:29:45,282
We got bigger fish to fry.

527
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:47,019
Is that my desk?

528
00:29:47,021 --> 00:29:48,855
- Yeah.
- What?

529
00:29:48,857 --> 00:29:50,292
Why do I have such a small desk?

530
00:29:50,294 --> 00:29:51,795
Because you weren't there
when we were choosing desks.

531
00:29:51,797 --> 00:29:52,863
You snooze, you lose.

532
00:29:52,865 --> 00:29:53,967
Well, I was under house arrest.

533
00:29:53,969 --> 00:29:55,003
Yeah.

534
00:29:55,005 --> 00:29:56,003
You know what,
this isn't even a desk.

535
00:29:56,005 --> 00:29:57,305
This is garbage.

536
00:29:57,307 --> 00:30:00,045
You found this outside
amongst garbage.

537
00:30:00,047 --> 00:30:01,449
I got it at a rummage sale.

538
00:30:01,451 --> 00:30:02,917
So, you save money on my desk?

539
00:30:02,919 --> 00:30:04,152
Guys.

540
00:30:04,154 --> 00:30:06,323
Hope, please,
we need to focus, all right?

541
00:30:06,325 --> 00:30:08,328
We gotta find
that lab already. Jeez.

542
00:30:09,466 --> 00:30:11,066
Oh, you know what?
I heard stories,

543
00:30:11,068 --> 00:30:12,268
like what happened to you.

544
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:14,273
This crazy, creepy cat, who
walks through walls and stuff.

545
00:30:14,275 --> 00:30:16,143
Like a ghost.

546
00:30:16,145 --> 00:30:17,849
Like Baba Yaga.

547
00:30:20,886 --> 00:30:23,758
Baba Yaga, the witch.

548
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,132
They tell stories to children
to frighten them.

549
00:30:27,366 --> 00:30:28,702
You know Baba Yaga?

550
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,341
Whoever stole it...

551
00:30:31,343 --> 00:30:33,076
we need to find it.

552
00:30:33,078 --> 00:30:36,852
Oh, you don't find someone
like that. They find you.

553
00:30:36,854 --> 00:30:38,956
Like Baba Yaga.

554
00:30:38,958 --> 00:30:41,494
Dr. Pym, you're the smartest
genius I know.

555
00:30:41,496 --> 00:30:44,065
Didn't you put some kind of
LoJack on your lab?

556
00:30:44,067 --> 00:30:45,235
Because if you didn't,

557
00:30:45,237 --> 00:30:47,372
we have a variety
of affordable options.

558
00:30:47,374 --> 00:30:51,080
Of course I did, Luis.
It was disabled.

559
00:30:51,082 --> 00:30:53,786
Whoever stole the lab knew
exactly what they were doing.

560
00:30:53,788 --> 00:30:55,522
They also looked like
they were phasing.

561
00:30:55,524 --> 00:30:56,891
Phasing?

562
00:30:56,893 --> 00:30:58,528
Quantum phasing.
When an object moves

563
00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:00,064
through different states
of matter.

564
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:01,868
Oh, yeah,
that's what I was thinking.

565
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:02,969
The lab emits radiation.

566
00:31:02,971 --> 00:31:06,075
Can we modify a quantum
spectrometer and track it?

567
00:31:06,077 --> 00:31:08,815
That could work, yes, but all
my equipment is in the lab.

568
00:31:08,817 --> 00:31:10,385
Where else can we find
that equipment?

569
00:31:12,391 --> 00:31:14,161
Well, there is one person.

570
00:31:15,329 --> 00:31:16,898
Bill Foster.

571
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,100
Great!

572
00:31:18,102 --> 00:31:19,837
Who's Bill Foster?

573
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:21,908
He's an old colleague of
my dad's, from S.H.I.E.L.D.

574
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:23,978
They had a falling out
years ago.

575
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,850
You seem to have a lot of
falling outs with people.

576
00:31:25,852 --> 00:31:27,987
It's probably
just a waste of time.

577
00:31:27,989 --> 00:31:29,923
Hey, I'm risking everything
by being here.

578
00:31:29,925 --> 00:31:31,391
Don't you think we should check?

579
00:31:31,393 --> 00:31:33,430
We need to find out
who took the lab.

580
00:32:26,203 --> 00:32:27,705
Guys, it's not a good idea

581
00:32:27,707 --> 00:32:29,308
to be out in the open like this.

582
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:32,481
Relax,
no one's gonna recognize us.

583
00:32:32,483 --> 00:32:34,652
What, because of hats
and sunglasses?

584
00:32:34,654 --> 00:32:36,390
That's not a disguise, Hank.

585
00:32:36,392 --> 00:32:38,593
We look like ourselves
at a baseball game.

586
00:32:38,595 --> 00:32:41,032
<i><font color="#80ffff">In an isolated system...</i></font>

587
00:32:41,034 --> 00:32:45,574
particles co-exist in
a stable phase relationship.

588
00:32:45,576 --> 00:32:47,612
If the system
is interfered with,

589
00:32:47,614 --> 00:32:51,119
that stability becomes chaos.

590
00:32:51,121 --> 00:32:53,122
Unpredictable.

591
00:32:53,124 --> 00:32:56,128
Dangerous.
Beautiful.

592
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:58,132
Isolated completely,
a quantum system

593
00:32:58,134 --> 00:33:00,670
would revert back to
separate states of matter...

594
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:04,379
each entangled with a distinct
state of its environment.

595
00:33:04,381 --> 00:33:07,051
In other words,
the object in question

596
00:33:07,053 --> 00:33:08,687
would be both
in and out of phase...

597
00:33:08,689 --> 00:33:11,695
with multiple
parallel realities.

598
00:33:17,105 --> 00:33:20,777
Speaking of being out of phase
with reality.

599
00:33:20,779 --> 00:33:23,682
I am noticing
an unusually high number

600
00:33:23,684 --> 00:33:25,854
of glazed eyes out there
among you.

601
00:33:26,793 --> 00:33:30,161
So, why don't we call it
a few minutes early?

602
00:33:30,163 --> 00:33:31,431
That'll be enough for today.

603
00:33:31,433 --> 00:33:33,153
Thank you, ladies
and gentlemen, you may go.

604
00:33:35,173 --> 00:33:38,712
It's incredible.
You're linked to Janet.

605
00:33:38,714 --> 00:33:41,151
It's quantum entanglement
between the quantum states of

606
00:33:41,153 --> 00:33:43,155
Posner molecules in your brains.

607
00:33:43,157 --> 00:33:45,359
Yeah, that's what
I was thinking.

608
00:33:45,361 --> 00:33:46,429
Do you guys
just put the word "quantum"

609
00:33:46,431 --> 00:33:47,497
in front of everything?

610
00:33:47,499 --> 00:33:49,235
Doctor, we need to find our lab.

611
00:33:49,237 --> 00:33:50,637
Hope, I'd love to help you...

612
00:33:50,639 --> 00:33:51,772
but I don't have anything

613
00:33:51,774 --> 00:33:52,940
like the equipment
you're describing.

614
00:33:52,942 --> 00:33:54,880
I told you this is a waste
of time. Come on, let's go.

615
00:33:54,882 --> 00:33:56,414
Don't condescend, Hank.

616
00:33:56,416 --> 00:33:58,585
You're the one who's
on the run from the FBI.

617
00:33:58,587 --> 00:34:00,489
All because
you had to grow to a size

618
00:34:00,491 --> 00:34:02,361
that finally fit your ego.

619
00:34:02,363 --> 00:34:05,565
That wasn't me in Germany.
It was this idiot.

620
00:34:05,567 --> 00:34:06,569
Really?

621
00:34:08,375 --> 00:34:10,644
Going that big,
it must've been exhausting.

622
00:34:10,646 --> 00:34:12,813
I slept for three days
straight. You have no idea.

623
00:34:12,815 --> 00:34:14,284
Actually, I do.

624
00:34:14,286 --> 00:34:15,921
Back in the day,
I was Hank's partner

625
00:34:15,923 --> 00:34:17,824
on a project called Goliath.

626
00:34:17,826 --> 00:34:19,526
Excuse me?
You were my partner?

627
00:34:19,528 --> 00:34:21,566
The only thing more tiring
than going that big

628
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:23,670
is putting up
with Hank's bullshit.

629
00:34:23,672 --> 00:34:25,032
Right...

630
00:34:26,543 --> 00:34:29,516
I don't know.
How big did you get?

631
00:34:29,518 --> 00:34:32,220
My record? 21 feet.

632
00:34:32,222 --> 00:34:33,555
- Not bad.
- You?

633
00:34:33,557 --> 00:34:34,657
I don't...

634
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:35,661
No, really, I'm curious.

635
00:34:36,664 --> 00:34:38,566
- 65 feet. Yeah.
- Whoa!

636
00:34:38,568 --> 00:34:40,537
- Huge.
- 65.

637
00:34:40,539 --> 00:34:43,242
If you two are finished
comparing sizes...

638
00:34:43,244 --> 00:34:45,412
we need to figure out a way
to track down the lab.

639
00:34:45,414 --> 00:34:48,552
And the great Hank Pym hasn't
figured that one out yet?

640
00:34:48,554 --> 00:34:50,423
Strange.

641
00:34:50,425 --> 00:34:52,327
You had all the answers
back in the day.

642
00:34:52,329 --> 00:34:53,695
That's why I left the project.

643
00:34:53,697 --> 00:34:55,766
Left? I fired you.

644
00:34:55,768 --> 00:34:57,336
Best decision I ever made.

645
00:34:57,338 --> 00:34:59,575
Hank was a terrible partner.
Temperamental...

646
00:34:59,577 --> 00:35:01,845
stubborn, impatient.

647
00:35:01,847 --> 00:35:03,784
Sooner or later,
he just pushed everyone away.

648
00:35:03,786 --> 00:35:05,452
Just the mediocrities.

649
00:35:05,454 --> 00:35:07,624
Janet was the only one
who could endure him

650
00:35:07,626 --> 00:35:08,592
and chose to stick it out.

651
00:35:08,594 --> 00:35:09,961
Watch it, Bill.

652
00:35:09,963 --> 00:35:11,532
She paid the price,
though, didn't she?

653
00:35:11,534 --> 00:35:12,601
You son of a bitch.

654
00:35:12,603 --> 00:35:14,970
I didn't come here
to listen to you two squabble.

655
00:35:14,972 --> 00:35:16,708
I'm trying to save my mother.

656
00:35:17,945 --> 00:35:19,380
Now, which office would you say?

657
00:35:19,382 --> 00:35:20,384
Oh, it's Woo.

658
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:22,887
Someone must have seen me.

659
00:35:22,889 --> 00:35:24,423
Relax.
If this is about you,

660
00:35:24,425 --> 00:35:25,827
they'd be in your house by now.

661
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:29,802
What are you, 15?

662
00:35:29,804 --> 00:35:30,938
Come on.
We gotta go right now.

663
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:34,644
Wait. You might be able to
improvise that tracker...

664
00:35:34,646 --> 00:35:35,679
if you modify
the diffraction units

665
00:35:35,681 --> 00:35:37,416
on one of your regulators.

666
00:35:37,418 --> 00:35:39,588
- That could work.
- I don't know what that means.

667
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:41,394
Thank you. Thank you.

668
00:35:52,815 --> 00:35:54,483
But, Doctor, campus police says

669
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:56,387
they ID'd both Pym and Van Dyne.

670
00:35:56,389 --> 00:35:57,757
I don't know
what to tell you, Agent.

671
00:35:57,759 --> 00:35:59,760
I haven't talked to Hank
in 30 years.

672
00:35:59,762 --> 00:36:00,697
I can assure you
I'm the last person

673
00:36:00,699 --> 00:36:01,965
he would want to visit.

674
00:36:01,967 --> 00:36:02,900
Oh, come on, you expect us to...

675
00:36:02,902 --> 00:36:03,904
Hey, hey.

676
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:06,472
Why is that?

677
00:36:06,474 --> 00:36:08,978
Simple.
We hate each other's guts.

678
00:36:10,016 --> 00:36:11,851
So I'm a terrible partner?

679
00:36:11,853 --> 00:36:14,121
Foster, he hasn't had
one good idea

680
00:36:14,123 --> 00:36:15,691
in his unremarkable career.

681
00:36:15,693 --> 00:36:17,630
But his idea about the
diffractors could work, right?

682
00:36:17,632 --> 00:36:19,767
Fine, one decent idea.

683
00:36:19,769 --> 00:36:21,704
Except, I eliminated
the diffractors

684
00:36:21,706 --> 00:36:23,410
when I upgraded the suits.

685
00:36:25,914 --> 00:36:28,117
So, if we had an old suit,

686
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:30,555
we might be able
to track down the lab?

687
00:36:30,557 --> 00:36:31,693
Yes, but we don't.

688
00:36:34,063 --> 00:36:35,800
- What if we did?
- What do you mean?

689
00:36:37,204 --> 00:36:38,204
I mean...

690
00:36:39,509 --> 00:36:40,842
life's funny.

691
00:36:40,844 --> 00:36:42,679
Oh, my God.
You didn't destroy the suit.

692
00:36:42,681 --> 00:36:44,014
What?

693
00:36:44,016 --> 00:36:46,488
Well, it was
your life's work, Hank.

694
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:47,691
I couldn't destroy that.

695
00:36:49,126 --> 00:36:50,563
Before I turned myself in,

696
00:36:50,565 --> 00:36:51,898
I shrunk it down
and mailed it to Luis.

697
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:54,668
You sent my suit
through the mail?

698
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:56,541
Hey, the postal service
is very reliable.

699
00:36:56,543 --> 00:36:59,813
You know, they do tracking
numbers now. Like UPS.

700
00:36:59,815 --> 00:37:01,182
Where is it?

701
00:37:01,184 --> 00:37:03,755
It's in a very safe place,
all right? Don't worry.

702
00:37:03,757 --> 00:37:06,561
What, the trophy?
No, it's not here.

703
00:37:06,563 --> 00:37:07,963
What do you mean it's not
there? Where could it be?

704
00:37:07,965 --> 00:37:09,599
I looked everywhere.
It's not here.

705
00:37:09,601 --> 00:37:11,068
Hey, get away from the plant.

706
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:13,030
But I put it back
after Cassie and I...

707
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:15,612
Show-and-tell.

708
00:37:15,614 --> 00:37:16,615
Scotty?

709
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:20,555
No, stop!

710
00:37:20,557 --> 00:37:22,626
Well, the good news is
I know where it is.

711
00:37:29,106 --> 00:37:30,675
Whenever you go
back to school...

712
00:37:30,677 --> 00:37:32,345
isn't everything supposed to
look so much smaller?

713
00:37:32,347 --> 00:37:33,847
This place seems huge.

714
00:37:33,849 --> 00:37:35,050
<i><font color="#80ffff">What is it?</i></font>

715
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:36,286
It's the new regulator.

716
00:37:36,288 --> 00:37:38,289
Hank, what's
going on with this suit?

717
00:37:38,291 --> 00:37:40,061
How much of
a work in progress is this?

718
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:44,702
Uh-oh.
No, no, no.

719
00:37:52,922 --> 00:37:53,923
Oh.

720
00:37:56,963 --> 00:37:58,896
What are you, laughing?
Please, could you just...

721
00:37:58,898 --> 00:38:00,167
Okay, okay.

722
00:38:03,775 --> 00:38:05,110
<i><font color="#80ffff">What do you see?</i></font>

723
00:38:05,112 --> 00:38:07,182
The sizing coils
are malfunctioning.

724
00:38:07,184 --> 00:38:08,885
Just let me...

725
00:38:08,887 --> 00:38:10,367
Ow!

726
00:38:12,326 --> 00:38:13,326
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

727
00:38:16,034 --> 00:38:18,203
Okay. All right.

728
00:38:18,938 --> 00:38:20,141
Try that.

729
00:38:24,351 --> 00:38:25,351
Sorry.

730
00:38:26,255 --> 00:38:27,256
What?

731
00:38:31,298 --> 00:38:32,463
Awesome.

732
00:38:32,465 --> 00:38:34,802
If only Cap could see you now.

733
00:38:34,804 --> 00:38:36,406
Hilarious.
What are we gonna do?

734
00:38:47,429 --> 00:38:48,963
Hey!

735
00:38:48,965 --> 00:38:50,101
Where's your hall pass?

736
00:38:52,106 --> 00:38:53,409
Hey, I'm talking to you.

737
00:38:55,311 --> 00:38:56,311
Hey!

738
00:38:57,483 --> 00:38:59,119
Hey. Eh...

739
00:39:23,934 --> 00:39:26,005
You can do it.

740
00:39:26,007 --> 00:39:28,110
You almost got it.

741
00:39:40,302 --> 00:39:42,038
Oh, peanut.

742
00:39:54,563 --> 00:39:56,032
Okay, let's go.

743
00:40:12,197 --> 00:40:14,300
Hiya, champ,
how was school today?

744
00:40:15,472 --> 00:40:17,909
All right, get your jokes out now.
Can you fix the suit?

745
00:40:17,911 --> 00:40:19,543
So cranky.

746
00:40:19,545 --> 00:40:22,184
You want a juice box
and some string cheese?

747
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:24,222
Do you really have that?

748
00:40:33,974 --> 00:40:35,374
Let's see if Foster was right.

749
00:40:49,039 --> 00:40:50,208
This has gotta be the lab.

750
00:40:54,282 --> 00:40:55,514
Let's go get it.

751
00:40:55,516 --> 00:40:56,518
Yeah.

752
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:07,273
This seems right.

753
00:41:09,144 --> 00:41:12,016
Look at us, teaming
up twice in one day.

754
00:41:12,018 --> 00:41:13,650
Makes you think, huh?

755
00:41:13,652 --> 00:41:14,686
About what?

756
00:41:14,688 --> 00:41:16,592
Germany.

757
00:41:16,594 --> 00:41:17,561
What do you mean?

758
00:41:17,563 --> 00:41:20,599
We were working together,
training together...

759
00:41:20,601 --> 00:41:23,606
and other stuffing together.

760
00:41:23,608 --> 00:41:25,711
If I had asked you,
would you have come?

761
00:41:25,713 --> 00:41:27,414
I guess we'll never know.

762
00:41:27,416 --> 00:41:28,814
But I do know one thing.

763
00:41:28,816 --> 00:41:30,385
What?

764
00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:32,758
If I had,
you'd have never been caught.

765
00:41:40,675 --> 00:41:42,510
Hey, Scott.

766
00:41:42,512 --> 00:41:44,648
You think you can stop
daydreaming about my daughter

767
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:46,318
long enough to get my lab?

768
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,157
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

769
00:41:53,601 --> 00:41:55,503
Okay, you're transmitting.

770
00:41:55,505 --> 00:41:56,704
What took you so long?

771
00:41:56,706 --> 00:41:59,309
Sorry, I had to come
up with a name for my ant.

772
00:41:59,311 --> 00:42:01,414
I'm thinking
Ulysses S. Gr-Ant.

773
00:42:01,851 --> 00:42:03,217
You like it?

774
00:42:03,219 --> 00:42:04,387
Hilarious.

775
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:07,526
<i><font color="#80ffff">I'm not getting anything
on the monitors.</i></font>

776
00:42:07,528 --> 00:42:09,630
There's some kind of
electronic disturbance.

777
00:42:09,632 --> 00:42:10,833
<i><font color="#80ffff">Be careful.</i></font>

778
00:42:10,835 --> 00:42:12,995
You know me, Hank.
I'm always careful... Whoa!

779
00:42:13,807 --> 00:42:15,541
It's okay.
It's just the suit.

780
00:42:15,543 --> 00:42:17,303
- How do you know?
- Look.

781
00:42:20,487 --> 00:42:22,255
That's Ghost?

782
00:42:22,257 --> 00:42:23,525
What is she doing?

783
00:42:23,527 --> 00:42:24,693
Do you think that suit is how

784
00:42:24,695 --> 00:42:26,831
she goes through walls
and stuff?

785
00:42:26,833 --> 00:42:28,702
Let's just get outta
here before she wakes up.

786
00:42:28,704 --> 00:42:30,675
Hope,
look! There's the lab.

787
00:42:36,552 --> 00:42:38,588
Now, we're sure
this is our shrunken building

788
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:39,789
and not somebody else's, right?

789
00:42:39,791 --> 00:42:42,031
Just take it, Scott.
Come on, we gotta be fast.

790
00:42:42,898 --> 00:42:43,900
I'll get it.

791
00:42:45,737 --> 00:42:47,206
Oh, shit...

792
00:42:59,764 --> 00:43:02,235
Hope. Hope! Hank.

793
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:04,305
Guys.

794
00:43:04,307 --> 00:43:06,545
I don't think they can hear you.

795
00:43:08,882 --> 00:43:10,385
Hi.

796
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:12,456
I'm Ava.

797
00:43:12,657 --> 00:43:13,926
Scott.

798
00:43:16,498 --> 00:43:17,934
So, you don't need the suit...

799
00:43:20,005 --> 00:43:21,841
to go through things.

800
00:43:22,644 --> 00:43:24,345
No.

801
00:43:24,347 --> 00:43:27,485
It just helps me control it.

802
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:32,762
And the pain, supposedly.

803
00:43:37,407 --> 00:43:38,807
You're not gonna reach
into my chest

804
00:43:38,809 --> 00:43:40,043
and crush my heart, are you?

805
00:43:43,818 --> 00:43:45,355
You're funny.

806
00:43:48,496 --> 00:43:51,269
I'm not gonna hurt you, Scott,
unless I have to.

807
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:55,477
I need...

808
00:43:56,845 --> 00:43:58,650
what's in your head.

809
00:44:12,945 --> 00:44:14,479
Let's wake up
the rest of the gang

810
00:44:14,481 --> 00:44:15,761
and get this over with,
shall we?

811
00:44:18,521 --> 00:44:19,556
Get up!

812
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:21,360
Come on!

813
00:44:23,967 --> 00:44:25,068
Dad?

814
00:44:27,541 --> 00:44:29,675
Don't ever touch him again.

815
00:44:29,677 --> 00:44:30,846
Now, now, Hope...

816
00:44:32,115 --> 00:44:33,717
I think I'm being rather
gentle with your father,

817
00:44:33,719 --> 00:44:34,753
all things considered.

818
00:44:36,023 --> 00:44:37,661
What the hell
are you talking about?

819
00:44:38,561 --> 00:44:41,666
Another casualty
of Hank Pym's ego.

820
00:44:43,038 --> 00:44:44,039
Bill.

821
00:44:45,775 --> 00:44:47,711
What have you done?

822
00:44:47,713 --> 00:44:50,418
It's what you've done,
Dr. Pym.

823
00:44:50,887 --> 00:44:52,454
You're with her?

824
00:44:52,456 --> 00:44:54,858
Oh, man.
I thought you were cool.

825
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:56,863
What the hell is going on here?

826
00:44:56,865 --> 00:44:58,869
I doubt Hank has
ever mentioned my father.

827
00:45:00,039 --> 00:45:01,706
Why would he?

828
00:45:01,708 --> 00:45:03,577
Elihas Starr.

829
00:45:04,713 --> 00:45:07,117
They were colleagues
at S.H.I.E.L.D.

830
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:09,653
Quantum research.

831
00:45:09,655 --> 00:45:13,796
Until my father dare disagree
with the great Hank Pym.

832
00:45:13,798 --> 00:45:15,599
You had him fired.

833
00:45:15,601 --> 00:45:17,471
Oh, and discredited
for good measure.

834
00:45:20,813 --> 00:45:24,753
My father tried to continue
his research on his own.

835
00:45:26,257 --> 00:45:29,193
Desperate to restore his name,
so he took risks.

836
00:45:29,195 --> 00:45:30,197
No, no, no!

837
00:45:31,233 --> 00:45:32,235
Too many.

838
00:45:33,639 --> 00:45:35,608
<i><font color="#80ffff">Until something went wrong.</i></font>

839
00:45:36,545 --> 00:45:38,079
He told us to run.

840
00:45:38,081 --> 00:45:39,046
Elihas, what's happening?

841
00:45:39,048 --> 00:45:40,816
Just go. Go!

842
00:45:40,818 --> 00:45:43,222
Daddy! Daddy!

843
00:45:43,224 --> 00:45:44,492
<i><font color="#80ffff">I could tell he was scared.</i></font>

844
00:45:49,938 --> 00:45:50,903
Daddy!

845
00:45:50,905 --> 00:45:52,007
Ava, no!

846
00:45:55,648 --> 00:45:57,050
<i><font color="#80ffff">I didn't want him to be alone.</i></font>

847
00:45:58,688 --> 00:45:59,789
No! No!

848
00:46:07,773 --> 00:46:09,809
<i><font color="#80ffff">When I woke up,
my parents were dead.</i></font>

849
00:46:12,681 --> 00:46:14,284
<i><font color="#80ffff">I wasn't so lucky.</i></font>

850
00:46:19,262 --> 00:46:22,068
<i><font color="#80ffff">They call it
"molecular disequilibrium."</i></font>

851
00:46:23,336 --> 00:46:25,673
<i><font color="#80ffff">A rather dull name, I think.</i></font>

852
00:46:25,675 --> 00:46:28,880
<i><font color="#80ffff">Doesn't quite do justice
to what it means.</i></font>

853
00:46:28,882 --> 00:46:32,787
Every cell in my body
is torn apart...

854
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:34,124
and stitched back together.

855
00:46:35,061 --> 00:46:36,996
Over and over.

856
00:46:36,998 --> 00:46:38,635
Every day.

857
00:46:40,137 --> 00:46:42,141
I was still at S.H.I.E.L.D.
when I got the call

858
00:46:42,143 --> 00:46:44,646
about a quantum anomaly
in Argentina.

859
00:46:48,019 --> 00:46:49,019
Hello, Ava.

860
00:46:50,458 --> 00:46:52,726
My name's Bill.

861
00:46:52,728 --> 00:46:54,197
I was a friend of your father's.

862
00:46:56,369 --> 00:46:57,672
I brought you something.

863
00:47:02,347 --> 00:47:04,318
It's all right.
Try again.

864
00:47:06,056 --> 00:47:07,889
That's it.

865
00:47:07,891 --> 00:47:10,163
<i><font color="#80ffff">Dr. Foster did his best
to keep me safe.</i></font>

866
00:47:11,032 --> 00:47:12,833
But others at S.H.I.E.L.D.

867
00:47:12,835 --> 00:47:15,039
saw an opportunity
in my affliction.

868
00:47:18,514 --> 00:47:20,182
<i><font color="#80ffff">They built me
a containment suit,</i></font>

869
00:47:20,184 --> 00:47:22,519
<i><font color="#80ffff">so I could control my phasing.</i></font>

870
00:47:22,521 --> 00:47:24,121
<i><font color="#80ffff">And trained me
to be a stealth operative.</i></font>

871
00:47:25,394 --> 00:47:26,396
<i><font color="#80ffff">They weaponized me.</i></font>

872
00:47:27,965 --> 00:47:29,333
<i><font color="#80ffff">I stole for them.
Spied for them.</i></font>

873
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:33,142
<i><font color="#80ffff">Killed for them.</i></font>

874
00:47:33,144 --> 00:47:35,345
And in exchange for my soul...

875
00:47:35,347 --> 00:47:37,085
they were going to cure me.

876
00:47:40,423 --> 00:47:42,195
They lied.

877
00:47:43,329 --> 00:47:46,267
When S.H.I.E.L.D. collapsed,
I took Ava in.

878
00:47:46,269 --> 00:47:48,137
I built the chamber
to slow her decay,

879
00:47:48,139 --> 00:47:49,507
but her condition
was progressive.

880
00:47:49,509 --> 00:47:51,629
I didn't know how to cure it.

881
00:47:52,282 --> 00:47:55,117
She wanted to kill you, Hank,
but I told her no...

882
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:56,521
and that she should
watch you instead.

883
00:47:56,523 --> 00:47:58,057
And sure enough, she discovered

884
00:47:58,059 --> 00:47:59,379
that you were
building the tunnel.

885
00:48:01,499 --> 00:48:03,601
Then, she told me about Lang.

886
00:48:03,603 --> 00:48:06,141
And the message from Janet
inside his head,

887
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:07,510
that's when I...

888
00:48:07,512 --> 00:48:08,845
Christ's sake!

889
00:48:08,847 --> 00:48:10,314
That's me. I'm sorry.

890
00:48:10,316 --> 00:48:11,918
Look, can you tell me
who's texting me?

891
00:48:12,989 --> 00:48:14,624
"Cassie, 911."

892
00:48:14,626 --> 00:48:16,927
That's my daughter.
I need to text her back.

893
00:48:16,929 --> 00:48:18,331
No, that's not happening.

894
00:48:18,333 --> 00:48:20,401
What, it's 911.
That means it's an emergency.

895
00:48:20,403 --> 00:48:22,204
You're not making
demands here, Lang.

896
00:48:22,206 --> 00:48:24,242
You're not appreciating
the gravity of the...

897
00:48:25,213 --> 00:48:27,115
Okay, look, she's trying
to video chat me now.

898
00:48:27,117 --> 00:48:29,988
Something might be wrong.
Let me talk to her. Please.

899
00:48:32,494 --> 00:48:34,463
Cassie, are you okay?
What's the emergency?

900
00:48:34,465 --> 00:48:36,099
<i><font color="#80ffff">I can't find my soccer shoes.</i></font>

901
00:48:36,101 --> 00:48:37,468
What?

902
00:48:37,470 --> 00:48:38,537
<i><font color="#80ffff">I have a game tomorrow.</i></font>

903
00:48:38,539 --> 00:48:39,507
<i><font color="#80ffff">Hey, Scott,
I know that they're there.</i></font>

904
00:48:39,509 --> 00:48:41,478
<i><font color="#80ffff">Can you just walk the phone
around the house?</i></font>

905
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:43,014
No, I can't do that right now.

906
00:48:43,016 --> 00:48:45,117
- <i><font color="#80ffff">Why not?</i></font>
- Because I'm sick.

907
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:45,887
<i><font color="#80ffff">Hey, can you just
maybe look around</i></font>

908
00:48:45,889 --> 00:48:47,153
<i><font color="#80ffff">later then and call me back?</i></font>

909
00:48:47,155 --> 00:48:48,458
<i><font color="#80ffff">Please? Thank you.</i></font>

910
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:50,028
<i><font color="#80ffff">Bye, Daddy!</i></font>

911
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:51,965
- Bye, peanut!
- <i><font color="#80ffff">Feel better!</i></font>

912
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:53,333
<i><font color="#80ffff">Feel better, buddy!</i></font>

913
00:48:53,335 --> 00:48:56,173
I'm sorry.
It said emergency.

914
00:48:56,175 --> 00:48:58,010
Ava, I want to help you.

915
00:48:58,012 --> 00:49:00,180
She doesn't need your help.
I know how to save her.

916
00:49:00,182 --> 00:49:01,349
Oh, really? How?

917
00:49:01,351 --> 00:49:02,987
Janet.

918
00:49:02,989 --> 00:49:04,255
For the last 30 years,
she's been down there

919
00:49:04,257 --> 00:49:05,391
absorbing quantum energy.

920
00:49:05,393 --> 00:49:07,128
We can extract that energy.

921
00:49:07,130 --> 00:49:09,231
We can use it to repair
Ava's molecular structure...

922
00:49:09,233 --> 00:49:10,400
Extract it?

923
00:49:10,402 --> 00:49:11,470
- Yes.
- Are you insane?

924
00:49:11,472 --> 00:49:13,407
That would rip Janet apart.

925
00:49:13,409 --> 00:49:16,378
You don't know that.
I'm gonna fire up your tunnel.

926
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:17,717
When Janet's location

927
00:49:17,719 --> 00:49:19,086
pops into Lang's head,
he's gonna give it to me...

928
00:49:19,088 --> 00:49:20,755
or I'm gonna turn him over
to the FBI.

929
00:49:20,757 --> 00:49:22,092
What?

930
00:49:22,094 --> 00:49:24,028
You are gonna stay here...

931
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:25,632
just in case I need your help.

932
00:49:27,003 --> 00:49:28,536
Like hell I would help you!

933
00:49:28,538 --> 00:49:29,673
You'll do whatever I say.

934
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:31,075
You're gonna kill Janet!

935
00:49:31,077 --> 00:49:33,079
I'd be more worried
about yourself, Hank.

936
00:49:33,081 --> 00:49:36,019
Goddamn it, Bill!

937
00:49:36,021 --> 00:49:37,256
- Dad?
- Calm down, Hank.

938
00:49:38,092 --> 00:49:39,160
So help me God...

939
00:49:40,063 --> 00:49:41,229
The pills.

940
00:49:41,231 --> 00:49:43,099
It's his heart!
He needs his pills.

941
00:49:43,101 --> 00:49:45,572
Please, Dr. Foster.
They're in the tin. Please.

942
00:49:47,043 --> 00:49:48,443
He could die!

943
00:49:48,445 --> 00:49:49,512
Come on!

944
00:49:49,514 --> 00:49:51,115
Help him!

945
00:49:51,117 --> 00:49:52,552
Dad, just hang on, all right?

946
00:49:52,554 --> 00:49:53,820
Just keep breathing.
Stay calm.

947
00:49:53,822 --> 00:49:55,358
Help him, man! Come on!

948
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,360
The Altoid tin!

949
00:49:58,331 --> 00:49:59,333
Wait!

950
00:50:03,576 --> 00:50:04,577
Thanks, guys.

951
00:50:05,512 --> 00:50:06,547
Hank!

952
00:50:18,639 --> 00:50:21,443
Bill is filling
that girl's head with lies.

953
00:50:21,445 --> 00:50:25,117
Elihas Starr was a traitor.
He stole my plans.

954
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:27,354
Now, bring it down.
All right, lock it in.

955
00:50:27,356 --> 00:50:30,260
No, no, no.
The bolt is on the other side.

956
00:50:30,262 --> 00:50:32,731
Tighten that one down,
then bring it down one notch.

957
00:50:32,733 --> 00:50:33,735
Good job.

958
00:50:34,338 --> 00:50:35,371
It'll work.

959
00:50:35,373 --> 00:50:37,708
Foster, he could have fried
the entire system.

960
00:50:37,710 --> 00:50:39,144
Look, we'll adjust the relays

961
00:50:39,146 --> 00:50:40,713
while you go reprogram
the settings, all right?

962
00:50:40,715 --> 00:50:42,317
It's going to be fine.

963
00:50:48,431 --> 00:50:49,599
So, this is it.

964
00:50:49,601 --> 00:50:51,637
Yeah. You'd think
with all this time

965
00:50:51,639 --> 00:50:53,338
to prepare I'd be more ready.

966
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:56,445
Oh, going subatomic isn't
something you can prepare for.

967
00:50:56,447 --> 00:50:58,784
It kind of melts your mind.

968
00:50:58,786 --> 00:51:00,623
I mean seeing my mom again.

969
00:51:00,889 --> 00:51:01,889
Oh.

970
00:51:03,795 --> 00:51:06,197
What if she's a completely
different person?

971
00:51:06,199 --> 00:51:08,603
Yeah, like, uh,
George Washington.

972
00:51:08,605 --> 00:51:09,773
I'm serious, Scott.

973
00:51:10,474 --> 00:51:12,145
Or George Jefferson.

974
00:51:13,983 --> 00:51:15,820
What if she's forgotten
about me?

975
00:51:17,489 --> 00:51:19,624
When I was in prison...

976
00:51:19,626 --> 00:51:22,329
the only thing that got me
through was Cassie.

977
00:51:22,331 --> 00:51:23,767
I could have been locked up
for 100 years...

978
00:51:23,769 --> 00:51:25,049
I never would have
forgotten her.

979
00:51:27,374 --> 00:51:29,476
I know your mom
is counting the minutes

980
00:51:29,478 --> 00:51:31,215
until she can see you again.

981
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:33,820
Thank you.

982
00:51:41,336 --> 00:51:42,671
Hey.

983
00:51:42,673 --> 00:51:43,773
We got a big problem.

984
00:51:43,775 --> 00:51:44,842
You forgot
the motion sensor lights

985
00:51:44,844 --> 00:51:45,978
on the back of the building.

986
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:47,780
Oh, no.

987
00:51:47,782 --> 00:51:49,385
And they're on the proposal,

988
00:51:49,387 --> 00:51:50,854
and Karapetyan
asked for them specifically.

989
00:51:50,856 --> 00:51:55,363
Uh, yeah, look,
it's been a little crazy.

990
00:51:55,365 --> 00:51:56,965
Look, maybe I could stop by
tomorrow, take a look at it.

991
00:51:56,967 --> 00:51:57,934
No. No, no, no, no.

992
00:51:57,936 --> 00:51:59,570
The meeting is first thing
in the morning.

993
00:51:59,572 --> 00:52:00,974
You gotta come right now
and fix it.

994
00:52:00,976 --> 00:52:03,345
I can't. I wish I could,
but I can't leave.

995
00:52:03,347 --> 00:52:04,414
You know what,
I'm coming to you.

996
00:52:04,416 --> 00:52:06,885
I'll just bring the plans.
They're on the laptop.

997
00:52:06,887 --> 00:52:08,456
And you can fix them there.

998
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:09,657
Just tell me
where you are, okay?

999
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:10,827
It's complicated.

1000
00:52:10,829 --> 00:52:12,149
What do you mean
it's complicated?

1001
00:52:16,407 --> 00:52:18,543
As you can see, sir,

1002
00:52:18,545 --> 00:52:20,746
this system is state of the art.

1003
00:52:20,748 --> 00:52:22,983
Security of tomorrow, today.

1004
00:52:22,985 --> 00:52:24,421
Oh, that's so good!

1005
00:52:24,423 --> 00:52:25,889
And I love the lean-in, bro.
Keep practicin'.

1006
00:52:25,891 --> 00:52:27,025
Hey, I just gotta
drive up to Scotty's,

1007
00:52:27,027 --> 00:52:28,095
so we can fix the plans.

1008
00:52:28,097 --> 00:52:29,898
But don't worry, I'll be back
in plenty of time.

1009
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:32,970
- As you can see...
- Oh, oh, oh!

1010
00:52:32,972 --> 00:52:34,775
Tell me you got the van washed
for tomorrow morning.

1011
00:52:34,777 --> 00:52:36,479
Down to the undercarriage, baby.

1012
00:52:36,481 --> 00:52:37,813
You sprung
for the undercarriage wash?

1013
00:52:37,815 --> 00:52:39,584
Well, you said get the works.

1014
00:52:39,586 --> 00:52:41,621
That's a scam, bro. We live
in California, not Minnesota.

1015
00:52:41,623 --> 00:52:42,623
He's right.

1016
00:52:43,561 --> 00:52:45,764
The undercarriage wash,

1017
00:52:45,766 --> 00:52:47,432
that's for cleaning
off road salt...

1018
00:52:47,434 --> 00:52:50,807
laid down in our
more snow-laden sister states.

1019
00:52:50,809 --> 00:52:51,876
Who are you,
and why do you know so much

1020
00:52:51,878 --> 00:52:52,879
about car wash protocol?

1021
00:52:54,014 --> 00:52:55,749
Well, my name is Sonny Burch.

1022
00:52:55,751 --> 00:52:58,056
And I do my research, Luis.

1023
00:52:59,693 --> 00:53:02,965
To wit, I have learned
from a friend of mine...

1024
00:53:02,967 --> 00:53:04,867
at the FBI that you are

1025
00:53:04,869 --> 00:53:06,671
a known associate
of Scott Lang...

1026
00:53:06,673 --> 00:53:09,811
a known associate of Hank Pym,
who I've also learned...

1027
00:53:09,813 --> 00:53:12,615
has a portable
shrinking laboratory...

1028
00:53:12,617 --> 00:53:14,954
filled with
all kinds of juicy tech.

1029
00:53:14,956 --> 00:53:17,894
And you're gonna tell me
where it is.

1030
00:53:17,896 --> 00:53:19,530
Well, I hate to break it to you,

1031
00:53:19,532 --> 00:53:22,101
but I don't know
what you're talking about.

1032
00:53:22,103 --> 00:53:24,941
Well, I sense a resistance
in you, Luis.

1033
00:53:24,943 --> 00:53:27,981
And I have promised results
to some dangerous people.

1034
00:53:27,983 --> 00:53:31,623
So, I'm gonna introduce you
to my good friend, Uzman.

1035
00:53:32,657 --> 00:53:34,526
Now...

1036
00:53:34,528 --> 00:53:36,264
Uzman is a master

1037
00:53:36,266 --> 00:53:38,668
at extracting information
from the unwilling...

1038
00:53:38,670 --> 00:53:39,938
through psychoactive means.

1039
00:53:41,943 --> 00:53:44,045
Oh, is that truth serum?

1040
00:53:44,047 --> 00:53:46,017
There's no such thing
as truth serum.

1041
00:53:46,019 --> 00:53:47,720
That's just nonsense from TV.

1042
00:53:47,722 --> 00:53:49,523
Well, what is it then?

1043
00:53:49,525 --> 00:53:51,193
It's a little concoction

1044
00:53:51,195 --> 00:53:53,999
that he's been perfecting
since his days with the S.I.S.

1045
00:53:54,001 --> 00:53:56,905
It makes you suggestible
and highly responsive.

1046
00:53:56,907 --> 00:53:57,773
Well, dude, that's truth serum.

1047
00:53:57,775 --> 00:53:59,142
No, it's not.

1048
00:53:59,144 --> 00:54:02,115
No offensing, but they sound
like truth serum to me.

1049
00:54:02,117 --> 00:54:04,320
- Right?
- It's not a truth serum.

1050
00:54:04,322 --> 00:54:06,023
Okay. Hey, I believe you.

1051
00:54:06,025 --> 00:54:07,059
It's not a truth serum.

1052
00:54:07,061 --> 00:54:10,664
I mean, if it walk like duck
and talk like ducks...

1053
00:54:10,666 --> 00:54:12,068
The truth serum.

1054
00:54:12,070 --> 00:54:14,005
Well, I have
a lot of allergies...

1055
00:54:14,007 --> 00:54:15,644
so you might wanna think
about that.

1056
00:54:18,849 --> 00:54:20,586
We've got to get that lab back.

1057
00:54:21,322 --> 00:54:23,724
What?

1058
00:54:23,726 --> 00:54:25,862
The chamber and the suit
are barely helping anymore.

1059
00:54:27,702 --> 00:54:29,037
How long have I got?

1060
00:54:32,744 --> 00:54:34,146
A couple of weeks, maybe.

1061
00:54:36,686 --> 00:54:38,820
Well, then we'll make them
bring the lab back.

1062
00:54:38,822 --> 00:54:39,824
How?

1063
00:54:40,994 --> 00:54:43,398
Lang. He has
a daughter, right?

1064
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:44,400
You can't mean that.

1065
00:54:44,402 --> 00:54:46,003
Ava!

1066
00:54:48,108 --> 00:54:50,144
I tolerate a lot of the things
you do out there...

1067
00:54:50,146 --> 00:54:51,866
but I won't be a part
of anything like that.

1068
00:54:52,684 --> 00:54:53,784
You're not the one who's about

1069
00:54:53,786 --> 00:54:55,322
to fade away into nothing, Bill.

1070
00:54:55,324 --> 00:54:56,358
I am!

1071
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:59,030
You said you could fix me!

1072
00:55:01,804 --> 00:55:03,738
You promised.

1073
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:05,742
I know. I will.

1074
00:55:05,744 --> 00:55:07,046
But not like that.

1075
00:55:09,786 --> 00:55:12,121
You lay one finger
on that little girl...

1076
00:55:12,123 --> 00:55:14,394
I won't help you.
And we're done.

1077
00:55:20,072 --> 00:55:21,842
Fine.

1078
00:55:22,913 --> 00:55:24,782
There are other options.

1079
00:55:38,777 --> 00:55:40,979
You know what? You're right.
This isn't truth serum.

1080
00:55:40,981 --> 00:55:42,380
Because I don't feel anything.

1081
00:55:42,382 --> 00:55:44,119
That was a lie.
I do feel something.

1082
00:55:44,121 --> 00:55:45,255
This is truth serum!

1083
00:55:45,257 --> 00:55:46,423
There's no such thing!

1084
00:55:46,425 --> 00:55:48,126
Okay.

1085
00:55:48,128 --> 00:55:50,463
Okay, okay.

1086
00:55:50,465 --> 00:55:52,936
Now, I'm gonna make this
real easy for you, Luis.

1087
00:55:52,938 --> 00:55:54,140
Okay.

1088
00:55:56,409 --> 00:56:00,083
Where is Scott Lang?

1089
00:56:00,085 --> 00:56:01,253
Well, see, that's complicated.

1090
00:56:01,255 --> 00:56:03,322
Because when I first met
Scotty, he was in a bad place.

1091
00:56:03,324 --> 00:56:04,726
<i><font color="#80ffff">And I'm not talkin'
about cell block D.</i></font>

1092
00:56:04,728 --> 00:56:06,061
<i><font color="#80ffff">His wife had just filed for
divorce, and I was, like...</i></font>

1093
00:56:06,063 --> 00:56:08,400
<i><font color="#80ffff">"Damn, homie. She dumped you
when you're on lockup?"</i></font>

1094
00:56:08,402 --> 00:56:09,635
<i><font color="#80ffff">And he was, like,
"Yeah, I know.</i></font>"

1095
00:56:09,637 --> 00:56:10,338
<i><font color="#80ffff">"I thought I was gonna be
with her forever..."</i></font>

1096
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:11,273
<i><font color="#80ffff">"but now I'm all alone."</i></font>

1097
00:56:11,275 --> 00:56:13,843
<i><font color="#80ffff">"And I was, like," Damn, homie.
You know what?</i></font>

1098
00:56:13,845 --> 00:56:14,512
<i><font color="#80ffff">"You gotta chin up, because
you'll find a new partner."</i></font>

1099
00:56:14,514 --> 00:56:15,648
<i><font color="#80ffff">"But you know what? I'm Luis."</i></font>

1100
00:56:15,650 --> 00:56:16,682
<i><font color="#80ffff">And he says,
"You know what? I'm Scotty,</i></font>"

1101
00:56:16,684 --> 00:56:17,385
<i><font color="#80ffff">"and we're gonna be
best friends."</i></font>

1102
00:56:17,387 --> 00:56:19,456
Okay, hold on, hold on.

1103
00:56:19,458 --> 00:56:21,159
I like a good story
as much as the next person...

1104
00:56:21,161 --> 00:56:22,161
but what in the hell
does this have to do

1105
00:56:22,163 --> 00:56:23,363
with where Scott Lang is?

1106
00:56:23,365 --> 00:56:24,532
I'm getting there.
I'm getting there.

1107
00:56:24,534 --> 00:56:26,068
You put a dime in him,

1108
00:56:26,070 --> 00:56:27,271
you gotta let the whole song
play out.

1109
00:56:27,273 --> 00:56:29,342
He like human jukebox.

1110
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:30,978
Oh, my 'abuelita' had a jukebox
in the restaurant!

1111
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:32,179
<i><font color="#80ffff">Yeah, only played Morrissey.</i></font>

1112
00:56:33,452 --> 00:56:35,332
<i><font color="#80ffff">And if anybody ever
complained, she'd be like...</i></font>

1113
00:56:36,224 --> 00:56:37,624
<i><font color="#80ffff">You know, Chicanos,
we call him "Moz."</i></font>

1114
00:56:37,626 --> 00:56:38,961
<i><font color="#80ffff">Then</i></font>, ¡adios!

1115
00:56:38,963 --> 00:56:40,229
What can I say?
We relate to his

1116
00:56:40,231 --> 00:56:41,932
melancholy ballads, you know?

1117
00:56:41,934 --> 00:56:43,168
- Lang!
- Right, right, right.

1118
00:56:43,170 --> 00:56:44,204
So, anyway,
Scotty gets out of jail,

1119
00:56:44,206 --> 00:56:45,474
and he starts working for Hank.

1120
00:56:45,476 --> 00:56:46,407
<i><font color="#80ffff">That's when he met Hope.
And Hope's all, like...</i></font>

1121
00:56:46,409 --> 00:56:48,347
<i><font color="#80ffff">"I want nothing to do
with you."</i></font>

1122
00:56:48,349 --> 00:56:50,083
<i><font color="#80ffff">"Look at my hairdo,
I'm all business."</i></font>

1123
00:56:50,085 --> 00:56:51,318
<i><font color="#80ffff">And then Scotty's, like,</i></font>

1124
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:52,387
<i><font color="#80ffff">"You know what, girl?
My heart is all broken."</i></font>

1125
00:56:52,389 --> 00:56:53,423
<i><font color="#80ffff">"And I'll probably
never find love again,"</i></font>

1126
00:56:53,425 --> 00:56:54,157
<i><font color="#80ffff">"but damn
if I want to kiss you!"</i></font>

1127
00:56:54,159 --> 00:56:56,229
<i><font color="#80ffff">But then you fast forward</i></font>

1128
00:56:56,231 --> 00:56:56,929
<i><font color="#80ffff">and they're all
into each other, right?</i></font>

1129
00:56:56,931 --> 00:56:58,066
<i><font color="#80ffff">And then Scotty's, like,</i></font>

1130
00:56:58,068 --> 00:56:59,200
<i><font color="#80ffff">"You know what?
I can't tell you this..."</i></font>

1131
00:56:59,202 --> 00:57:01,606
<i><font color="#80ffff">"but I'm gonna go trash an
airport with Captain America."</i></font>

1132
00:57:01,608 --> 00:57:03,142
<i><font color="#80ffff">"And then she said," I can't
believe you split like that!</i></font>

1133
00:57:03,144 --> 00:57:04,579
<i><font color="#80ffff">"Smell you later, dummy."</i></font>

1134
00:57:04,581 --> 00:57:05,914
So, Scotty goes on house arrest.

1135
00:57:05,916 --> 00:57:06,916
<i><font color="#80ffff">And he won't admit it,
but his heart is all, like...</i></font>

1136
00:57:06,918 --> 00:57:09,153
<i><font color="#80ffff">"Damn! I thought
Hope coulda been"</i></font>

1137
00:57:09,155 --> 00:57:11,090
<i><font color="#80ffff">"my new true partner,
but I blew it!"</i></font>

1138
00:57:11,092 --> 00:57:12,226
<i><font color="#80ffff">But fate brought 'em
back together.</i></font>

1139
00:57:12,228 --> 00:57:13,329
And then Hope's heart is all...

1140
00:57:13,331 --> 00:57:14,666
<i><font color="#80ffff">"I'm worried
that I can't trust him..."</i></font>

1141
00:57:14,668 --> 00:57:16,702
<i><font color="#80ffff">"and he's gonna screw up
again, and ruin everything!"</i></font>

1142
00:57:16,704 --> 00:57:17,871
And then
my heart is all, like...

1143
00:57:17,873 --> 00:57:20,108
<i><font color="#80ffff">"That fancy raspberry filling
represents the company's red"</i></font>

1144
00:57:20,110 --> 00:57:21,679
<i><font color="#80ffff">"and we're days away from
going out of business. Oh!"</i></font>

1145
00:57:21,681 --> 00:57:22,546
"Out of business"?

1146
00:57:22,548 --> 00:57:23,684
"Days away"?

1147
00:57:23,686 --> 00:57:25,253
Damn truth serum!

1148
00:57:25,255 --> 00:57:27,324
I was trying to protect
you guys. I swear to God.

1149
00:57:27,326 --> 00:57:29,260
I was trying to be
a good boss, but we're broke!

1150
00:57:29,262 --> 00:57:30,063
And the Karapetyan's
our last hope.

1151
00:57:30,065 --> 00:57:31,264
And if we don't show up,
we're done!

1152
00:57:31,266 --> 00:57:32,434
That's terrible bossing!

1153
00:57:32,436 --> 00:57:33,601
Damn, bro!

1154
00:57:33,603 --> 00:57:35,283
- That's on me! That's on me!
- Hey!

1155
00:57:35,541 --> 00:57:37,378
Enough.

1156
00:57:39,684 --> 00:57:41,354
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

1157
00:57:42,755 --> 00:57:44,291
Where is Scott Lang?

1158
00:57:44,293 --> 00:57:45,293
I've been trying to tell you,

1159
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:46,561
he's in a tricky spot,
emotionally speaking.

1160
00:57:46,563 --> 00:57:48,264
Emotionally speaking.

1161
00:57:48,266 --> 00:57:51,271
Well, where is Scott Lang,
literally speaking!

1162
00:57:51,273 --> 00:57:52,708
Oh! The woods.

1163
00:57:52,710 --> 00:57:53,870
The woods?

1164
00:57:54,146 --> 00:57:55,248
Baba Yaga!

1165
00:57:56,483 --> 00:57:58,318
What do you mean, "the woods"?

1166
00:57:58,320 --> 00:57:59,488
The Muir Woods,
the second fire road

1167
00:57:59,490 --> 00:58:00,791
off the Panoramic Highway!

1168
00:58:00,793 --> 00:58:02,260
For God's sake!

1169
00:58:04,099 --> 00:58:05,767
<i><font color=Lime>♪ Baba Yaga,
come at night ♪</i></font>

1170
00:58:05,769 --> 00:58:08,007
<i><font color=Lime>♪ Little children,
sleepy tight ♪</i></font>

1171
00:58:10,277 --> 00:58:11,713
Damn it!

1172
00:58:13,583 --> 00:58:15,119
If that freak gets Pym's tech...

1173
00:58:15,121 --> 00:58:16,822
I'm never gonna see it.

1174
00:58:16,824 --> 00:58:17,824
So, what do we do now?

1175
00:58:19,297 --> 00:58:20,796
It's easier to steal it
from the Feds

1176
00:58:20,798 --> 00:58:22,333
than from the boogeyman.

1177
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:28,311
Hey, it's me. How'd you like
to get a promotion?

1178
00:58:28,313 --> 00:58:32,186
I got the location on Pym,
Van Dyne and Lang.

1179
00:58:32,188 --> 00:58:33,322
But you gonna
have to take 'em down now,

1180
00:58:33,324 --> 00:58:35,425
because they ain't gonna
be there for long.

1181
00:58:35,427 --> 00:58:37,297
And when you do,
you gonna get me that lab.

1182
00:58:37,798 --> 00:58:39,402
Understood.

1183
00:58:40,804 --> 00:58:42,539
Good news, gentlemen.

1184
00:58:42,541 --> 00:58:45,378
Feds are gonna do
the hard work for us.

1185
00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:47,316
What are you lookin' at?
Change my tires!

1186
00:58:47,318 --> 00:58:48,320
Right.

1187
00:58:50,492 --> 00:58:53,595
- Sir.
- Can you knock?

1188
00:58:53,597 --> 00:58:56,068
Sorry, sir.
Uh, but I just got a lead.

1189
00:58:57,338 --> 00:58:59,208
Ooh, I love leads.

1190
00:59:05,853 --> 00:59:07,188
System's in the green.

1191
00:59:07,190 --> 00:59:08,592
Priming the coils.

1192
00:59:11,166 --> 00:59:12,365
Full charge.

1193
00:59:12,367 --> 00:59:13,536
As soon as the tunnel's open...

1194
00:59:13,538 --> 00:59:14,671
let us know if you get anything

1195
00:59:14,673 --> 00:59:15,840
that could be
a part of her message.

1196
00:59:15,842 --> 00:59:17,177
Yeah, yeah. I will.

1197
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:20,650
Okay, then.

1198
00:59:23,456 --> 00:59:24,458
Here it goes.

1199
00:59:38,353 --> 00:59:39,722
We did it!

1200
00:59:40,456 --> 00:59:41,791
You got anything?

1201
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:46,601
Nothin'.

1202
00:59:46,603 --> 00:59:48,806
Well, just give it a minute,
because it could...

1203
00:59:50,309 --> 00:59:51,845
No.

1204
00:59:51,847 --> 00:59:53,447
No, no, no, no!

1205
00:59:53,449 --> 00:59:54,483
What's happening?

1206
00:59:54,485 --> 00:59:56,686
It's shutting down.
Maybe our vectors are off.

1207
00:59:56,688 --> 00:59:58,892
We've gone over them a million
times, I know they're right!

1208
00:59:58,894 --> 01:00:00,262
Then what else could it be?

1209
01:00:00,264 --> 01:00:01,784
I don't know!

1210
01:00:07,845 --> 01:00:09,311
- Scott, what are you doing?
- Scott, get away from that!

1211
01:00:09,313 --> 01:00:10,682
Scott, you can't...

1212
01:00:10,684 --> 01:00:12,318
I'm sorry, I don't know
how much time I have.

1213
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:13,523
I need to fix the algorithm.

1214
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:18,030
Trust me,
after 30 years down here...

1215
01:00:18,032 --> 01:00:19,702
I've thought about it a lot.

1216
01:00:24,077 --> 01:00:25,413
Janet?

1217
01:00:28,052 --> 01:00:29,454
Hi, honey.

1218
01:00:32,929 --> 01:00:34,599
Jellybean.

1219
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:36,368
Mom?

1220
01:00:37,570 --> 01:00:38,970
It's not the reunion
I'd imagined.

1221
01:00:38,972 --> 01:00:41,110
It's all so rushed.

1222
01:00:41,112 --> 01:00:43,548
You two have done
such great work.

1223
01:00:43,550 --> 01:00:45,519
You just need a little...

1224
01:00:45,753 --> 01:00:47,056
nudge.

1225
01:01:02,454 --> 01:01:04,758
Janet, how is this possible?

1226
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:07,996
It wasn't a message you put

1227
01:01:07,998 --> 01:01:09,499
in Scott's head.
It was an antenna.

1228
01:01:09,501 --> 01:01:11,503
Clever girl.

1229
01:01:11,505 --> 01:01:13,708
I'm so proud of you.

1230
01:01:13,710 --> 01:01:15,579
Honey, tell us where you are.

1231
01:01:15,581 --> 01:01:17,548
Tell us how to find you.

1232
01:01:17,550 --> 01:01:19,552
No, the probability fields
are too complex.

1233
01:01:19,554 --> 01:01:20,854
That's why I needed
to talk to you.

1234
01:01:20,856 --> 01:01:22,092
You have to follow my voice.

1235
01:01:22,695 --> 01:01:23,961
Of course!

1236
01:01:23,963 --> 01:01:25,633
Like tracing a call
back to its source!

1237
01:01:30,976 --> 01:01:34,081
I'm tracking your signal
using subatomic frequencies...

1238
01:01:34,083 --> 01:01:36,487
between point two
and point nine.

1239
01:01:36,489 --> 01:01:38,189
I'd narrow it to four and six.

1240
01:01:38,191 --> 01:01:39,492
That's too tight.
We could miss you.

1241
01:01:39,494 --> 01:01:40,864
Look at us squabbling again.

1242
01:01:42,032 --> 01:01:44,903
Fine. All right,
between three and seven.

1243
01:01:44,905 --> 01:01:48,010
Our first fight in decades,
and it's over just like that.

1244
01:02:02,572 --> 01:02:04,175
Bullseye.

1245
01:02:04,811 --> 01:02:06,079
Source lock.

1246
01:02:06,081 --> 01:02:08,048
It's you.

1247
01:02:08,050 --> 01:02:10,820
We got it!

1248
01:02:10,822 --> 01:02:12,892
You have to meet me
at these exact coordinates.

1249
01:02:12,894 --> 01:02:15,563
In the wasteland,
beyond the quantum void.

1250
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:16,798
It's very dangerous,

1251
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:19,005
especially on the human mind,
so be careful.

1252
01:02:19,007 --> 01:02:21,708
Time and space work very
differently down here.

1253
01:02:21,710 --> 01:02:23,246
You have two hours.

1254
01:02:23,248 --> 01:02:25,050
After that, the probability
fields will shift...

1255
01:02:25,052 --> 01:02:26,119
and it'll be another century

1256
01:02:26,121 --> 01:02:27,755
before they align
like this again.

1257
01:02:27,757 --> 01:02:29,560
We'll find you.

1258
01:02:36,106 --> 01:02:38,612
I know you will, Jellybean.

1259
01:02:43,021 --> 01:02:44,822
Nope.

1260
01:02:44,824 --> 01:02:46,827
Nothing. I got nothing.
No sign of Janet.

1261
01:02:46,829 --> 01:02:47,829
Perfect.

1262
01:02:49,867 --> 01:02:51,135
How did we get up here?

1263
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:58,115
All right, first you're gonna
see all kinds of lights...

1264
01:02:58,117 --> 01:02:59,318
and it's gonna get
really trippy...

1265
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:02,090
but then it's gonna turn black
and silent. Really silent.

1266
01:03:02,092 --> 01:03:04,161
Scott, I'll be fine.

1267
01:03:04,163 --> 01:03:05,363
I'm just saying
because I've been down there.

1268
01:03:05,365 --> 01:03:06,965
Yeah, so you've mentioned.

1269
01:03:10,007 --> 01:03:11,743
Um, sorry.
I have to take this.

1270
01:03:13,179 --> 01:03:14,682
<i><font color="#80ffff">Hey, man, you coming?</i></font>

1271
01:03:14,684 --> 01:03:16,653
No, I'm not,
but you know what? Ghost is.

1272
01:03:16,655 --> 01:03:18,689
And you know what? The Feds,
they know where you are.

1273
01:03:18,691 --> 01:03:20,126
- What?
- <i><font color="#80ffff">I'm sorry, I'm sorry.</i></font>

1274
01:03:20,128 --> 01:03:21,128
Uh, they gave me
some truth serum.

1275
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:22,430
And then all of a sudden

1276
01:03:22,432 --> 01:03:23,532
I started talkin' all honestly.

1277
01:03:23,534 --> 01:03:25,436
Like, I hate the way
that you load the dishwasher.

1278
01:03:25,438 --> 01:03:26,338
<i><font color="#80ffff">I hate it, I hate it.</i></font>

1279
01:03:26,340 --> 01:03:27,374
- Uh...
- <i><font color="#80ffff">But you need to go home...</i></font>

1280
01:03:27,376 --> 01:03:29,144
because the Feds
are probably going there now!

1281
01:03:29,146 --> 01:03:30,347
And by the way...

1282
01:03:30,349 --> 01:03:32,952
who puts the plates on the top
rack? They don't go there!

1283
01:03:42,740 --> 01:03:44,307
I feel like such a jerk.

1284
01:03:44,309 --> 01:03:46,713
You're gonna be really mad.
We gotta go now.

1285
01:03:46,715 --> 01:03:47,880
What?

1286
01:03:47,882 --> 01:03:49,885
Ghost knows where we are.
So does the FBI.

1287
01:03:49,887 --> 01:03:51,354
How?

1288
01:03:51,356 --> 01:03:53,459
- I told Luis where we are.
- You what?

1289
01:03:53,461 --> 01:03:54,128
I told him to come here
so I could help him

1290
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:55,831
with the Karapetyan proposal.

1291
01:03:55,833 --> 01:03:57,501
Oh, my God!

1292
01:03:57,503 --> 01:03:59,037
Look, we need
to land that account.

1293
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:00,305
Otherwise, we lose the business!

1294
01:04:00,307 --> 01:04:01,208
Do you know hard it is
for ex-cons

1295
01:04:01,210 --> 01:04:02,309
to find work these days?

1296
01:04:02,311 --> 01:04:03,681
Jesus, Scott!

1297
01:04:13,467 --> 01:04:15,034
90 seconds to close
the aperture!

1298
01:04:15,036 --> 01:04:16,805
You have to depolarize
the coils first!

1299
01:04:16,807 --> 01:04:17,974
I know!

1300
01:04:17,976 --> 01:04:20,246
I'm really sorry...

1301
01:04:20,248 --> 01:04:22,950
but the, um, FBI
is coming to my place so...

1302
01:04:22,952 --> 01:04:24,221
I have to go.

1303
01:04:26,193 --> 01:04:27,864
Can I borrow the suit?

1304
01:04:29,231 --> 01:04:30,791
<i><font color="#80ffff">Gyroscopic stabilizers.</i></font>

1305
01:04:31,135 --> 01:04:32,804
<i><font color="#80ffff">Powering on.</i></font>

1306
01:04:32,806 --> 01:04:35,142
I'm just gonna borrow the suit.

1307
01:04:35,144 --> 01:04:37,280
I'll come back.
Just tell me where you'll be.

1308
01:04:37,282 --> 01:04:38,981
- Don't bother.
- What?

1309
01:04:38,983 --> 01:04:40,153
We'll come
and get the suit from you,

1310
01:04:40,155 --> 01:04:41,421
as soon as we've found my mom.

1311
01:04:41,423 --> 01:04:43,393
- Hope...
- Scott, just go!

1312
01:05:00,996 --> 01:05:02,965
- Scott?
- Daddy?

1313
01:05:02,967 --> 01:05:04,200
It's us, buddy!

1314
01:05:04,202 --> 01:05:06,604
We're here for Cassie's shoes!

1315
01:05:06,606 --> 01:05:08,108
He must be resting.

1316
01:05:08,110 --> 01:05:09,276
Honey, why don't you go upstairs

1317
01:05:09,278 --> 01:05:10,345
and look under your bed?

1318
01:05:10,347 --> 01:05:12,516
Daddy, you upstairs?

1319
01:05:13,519 --> 01:05:15,088
Daddy?

1320
01:05:16,293 --> 01:05:17,295
What the...

1321
01:05:18,963 --> 01:05:21,066
He really lives
like a pig these days.

1322
01:05:24,275 --> 01:05:25,443
Daddy?

1323
01:05:33,159 --> 01:05:35,161
Spread out!

1324
01:05:35,163 --> 01:05:36,331
Again?

1325
01:05:36,333 --> 01:05:38,133
You people have no shame!

1326
01:05:38,135 --> 01:05:39,570
The monitor says
that he's in the bathroom.

1327
01:05:39,572 --> 01:05:40,574
Yeah, I'm not buying it!

1328
01:05:43,547 --> 01:05:45,449
Cassie, let the man get by!

1329
01:05:45,451 --> 01:05:47,318
But Daddy's super sick!

1330
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:48,688
I'll see about that!

1331
01:05:48,690 --> 01:05:50,559
He says he doesn't want
anyone else to get sick!

1332
01:05:50,561 --> 01:05:52,296
I'll take my chances, sweetie.

1333
01:05:52,298 --> 01:05:54,534
He barfed. Like, a lot.

1334
01:05:54,536 --> 01:05:56,170
Young lady, I'm a federal agent.

1335
01:05:56,172 --> 01:05:57,974
I've seen worse things
than vomit.

1336
01:05:58,978 --> 01:06:00,144
Like, "a lot" a lot?

1337
01:06:00,146 --> 01:06:01,649
- Yes!
- Forget it, move aside!

1338
01:06:02,249 --> 01:06:03,249
No!

1339
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:08,595
Woo!

1340
01:06:10,499 --> 01:06:12,336
- What are you doing here?
- Scott.

1341
01:06:14,009 --> 01:06:16,711
I'm sorry, I'm just really sick.

1342
01:06:16,713 --> 01:06:18,015
I told you.

1343
01:06:18,248 --> 01:06:19,650
Excuse me.

1344
01:06:19,652 --> 01:06:22,088
Sometimes you gotta just
get it out. You know?

1345
01:06:22,090 --> 01:06:23,791
Sorry.

1346
01:06:30,239 --> 01:06:31,773
I'll start the van.

1347
01:06:31,775 --> 01:06:33,712
You get the lab.

1348
01:06:36,585 --> 01:06:38,255
Freeze!
You're surrounded!

1349
01:06:52,284 --> 01:06:54,153
Hank Pym...

1350
01:06:54,155 --> 01:06:55,554
Hope Van Dyne...

1351
01:06:55,556 --> 01:06:56,724
you're under arrest.

1352
01:06:58,595 --> 01:06:59,762
This is harassment!

1353
01:06:59,764 --> 01:07:01,267
Actually, it's not.

1354
01:07:01,269 --> 01:07:02,702
What does the FBI
even stand for...

1355
01:07:02,704 --> 01:07:05,075
"Forever Bothering Individuals"?

1356
01:07:06,744 --> 01:07:08,704
- His monitor check out?
- Of course it does.

1357
01:07:09,217 --> 01:07:10,784
Damn it!

1358
01:07:10,786 --> 01:07:13,324
Looks like I just got fed
a bowl of malarkey.

1359
01:07:13,326 --> 01:07:15,228
We got 'em sir. Pym
and Van Dyne are in custody.

1360
01:07:16,398 --> 01:07:17,567
Seriously? Yes!

1361
01:07:19,403 --> 01:07:20,905
Oh, I'm sorry, Scott.

1362
01:07:20,907 --> 01:07:22,507
They're your friends.
That's insensitive.

1363
01:07:23,514 --> 01:07:25,347
I just really needed a win,
you know?

1364
01:07:25,349 --> 01:07:26,782
Anyway, I'll be back later

1365
01:07:26,784 --> 01:07:28,621
for the official end
of your sentence!

1366
01:07:28,623 --> 01:07:30,324
Sorry for misjudging you, pal!

1367
01:07:30,326 --> 01:07:32,163
You should feel great
about yourself!

1368
01:07:56,210 --> 01:07:57,345
What is it?

1369
01:07:57,347 --> 01:07:58,514
We have a man down.

1370
01:07:58,516 --> 01:07:59,885
And Pym's lab is gone.

1371
01:08:08,335 --> 01:08:09,336
Hey.

1372
01:08:11,407 --> 01:08:13,309
Thanks for covering for me.

1373
01:08:13,311 --> 01:08:14,311
Sure.

1374
01:08:16,918 --> 01:08:18,855
So...

1375
01:08:18,857 --> 01:08:21,461
how long
have you been Ant-Man again?

1376
01:08:25,436 --> 01:08:26,869
Not long.

1377
01:08:26,871 --> 01:08:28,707
It just sort of happened.

1378
01:08:28,709 --> 01:08:30,744
I'm sorry for lying to you...

1379
01:08:30,746 --> 01:08:32,547
and I'm sorry
for risking everything.

1380
01:08:32,549 --> 01:08:33,516
Daddy, it's okay.

1381
01:08:33,518 --> 01:08:34,653
It's not.

1382
01:08:35,656 --> 01:08:37,390
I do some dumb things...

1383
01:08:37,392 --> 01:08:39,663
and the people that I love
the most pay the price.

1384
01:08:39,665 --> 01:08:40,831
Mainly you.

1385
01:08:40,833 --> 01:08:43,368
Trying to help people
isn't dumb.

1386
01:08:45,608 --> 01:08:47,912
I screw it up
just about every time.

1387
01:08:47,914 --> 01:08:51,318
So, maybe you just need
someone watching your back...

1388
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:52,621
like a partner.

1389
01:08:52,623 --> 01:08:53,524
Well, she's made it clear

1390
01:08:53,526 --> 01:08:55,025
that's about the last thing
she wants.

1391
01:08:55,027 --> 01:08:56,328
Who?

1392
01:08:56,330 --> 01:08:57,598
Hope.

1393
01:09:00,038 --> 01:09:01,404
Wait, who did you think?

1394
01:09:01,406 --> 01:09:02,409
Me.

1395
01:09:02,876 --> 01:09:04,377
You?

1396
01:09:04,379 --> 01:09:06,349
Don't laugh.

1397
01:09:06,351 --> 01:09:07,583
I'd be a great partner.

1398
01:09:07,585 --> 01:09:09,654
Aw, peanut.

1399
01:09:09,656 --> 01:09:13,930
Aw. You would be awesome.
And if I let you...

1400
01:09:13,932 --> 01:09:15,968
I would be a terrible dad.

1401
01:09:16,437 --> 01:09:18,005
Fine.

1402
01:09:18,007 --> 01:09:20,678
Then have Hope be
your partner. She's smart.

1403
01:09:22,549 --> 01:09:23,885
She reminds me of you.

1404
01:09:24,586 --> 01:09:26,922
You gonna go help her?

1405
01:09:26,924 --> 01:09:28,894
I think you should help her.

1406
01:09:28,896 --> 01:09:31,931
I wish I could...

1407
01:09:31,933 --> 01:09:34,605
but I don't know how I could
help her without hurting you.

1408
01:09:37,946 --> 01:09:39,881
You can do it.

1409
01:09:39,883 --> 01:09:42,487
You can do anything.

1410
01:09:42,489 --> 01:09:45,426
You are the world's
greatest grandma.

1411
01:09:52,976 --> 01:09:54,810
Agent Woo will see you
in an hour.

1412
01:09:54,812 --> 01:09:56,948
An hour?
We don't have an hour.

1413
01:09:56,950 --> 01:09:59,019
Oh, you got
somewhere else to be?

1414
01:10:06,870 --> 01:10:09,074
Oh, now, that's my girl.

1415
01:10:15,722 --> 01:10:17,626
All right, what's our plan?

1416
01:10:19,496 --> 01:10:21,565
To shrink that wall.

1417
01:10:21,567 --> 01:10:22,734
It looks load-bearing.

1418
01:10:22,736 --> 01:10:23,903
The ceiling could collapse.

1419
01:10:23,905 --> 01:10:25,739
Then we run like hell.

1420
01:10:25,741 --> 01:10:28,110
Now, I estimate 15-20 agents
on the floor.

1421
01:10:28,112 --> 01:10:29,914
Roughly five times that
in the building at large.

1422
01:10:29,916 --> 01:10:31,551
They're all heavily armed.

1423
01:10:31,553 --> 01:10:32,553
Not great odds.

1424
01:10:33,190 --> 01:10:34,289
You got any better ideas?

1425
01:10:34,291 --> 01:10:35,494
Nope.

1426
01:10:36,530 --> 01:10:38,832
And I'm not giving up on Mom.

1427
01:10:38,834 --> 01:10:40,169
She'd be so proud of you.

1428
01:10:45,781 --> 01:10:46,783
Okay.

1429
01:10:48,086 --> 01:10:49,089
One...

1430
01:10:49,723 --> 01:10:50,725
two...

1431
01:10:55,901 --> 01:10:57,336
Scott?

1432
01:10:57,338 --> 01:10:58,873
What're you two
just standing around for?

1433
01:10:58,875 --> 01:11:00,143
We gotta go find that lab.

1434
01:11:01,112 --> 01:11:02,115
What about me?

1435
01:11:03,650 --> 01:11:05,217
Perfect.

1436
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:07,179
Hurry up and get dressed.
We don't have much time.

1437
01:11:20,217 --> 01:11:21,718
Okay, now what?

1438
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:23,089
You're asking me?

1439
01:11:25,893 --> 01:11:27,062
Get in!

1440
01:11:32,208 --> 01:11:33,209
Hi.

1441
01:11:34,010 --> 01:11:35,012
Hi.

1442
01:11:37,986 --> 01:11:41,155
Uh, excuse me. Are we planning
on leaving soon...

1443
01:11:41,157 --> 01:11:43,093
or are you two gonna keep
staring at each other...

1444
01:11:43,095 --> 01:11:45,332
until they start shooting at us?

1445
01:11:45,334 --> 01:11:46,736
Yeah.

1446
01:11:51,713 --> 01:11:52,913
- Hey, Burch.
<i><font color="#80ffff">- Yeah.</i></font>

1447
01:11:52,915 --> 01:11:54,082
Yeah, they're out.

1448
01:11:54,084 --> 01:11:55,219
<i><font color="#80ffff">I'm on my way.</i></font>

1449
01:12:00,230 --> 01:12:01,797
Her suit is missing,
and so is the van.

1450
01:12:01,799 --> 01:12:03,100
How could this happen?

1451
01:12:03,102 --> 01:12:04,805
I mean, what the dickens?

1452
01:12:07,110 --> 01:12:08,411
Thank you.

1453
01:12:09,715 --> 01:12:10,715
You're welcome.

1454
01:12:12,288 --> 01:12:15,091
So, uh, how do we find the lab?

1455
01:12:15,093 --> 01:12:16,292
After we lost it
the first time...

1456
01:12:16,294 --> 01:12:19,265
I put on a new tracker...

1457
01:12:19,267 --> 01:12:20,937
of sorts.

1458
01:12:29,987 --> 01:12:31,190
That'll work.

1459
01:12:58,178 --> 01:13:00,346
Is it ready or not?

1460
01:13:00,348 --> 01:13:02,953
We can begin
the extraction process.

1461
01:13:04,023 --> 01:13:05,190
Listen, Ava.

1462
01:13:05,192 --> 01:13:06,896
This whole thing
could be very dangerous.

1463
01:13:07,932 --> 01:13:09,065
Maybe we should...

1464
01:13:09,067 --> 01:13:12,003
Maybe we should what? Wait?

1465
01:13:12,005 --> 01:13:13,910
I've got days until I'm dead.

1466
01:13:15,214 --> 01:13:17,417
We're doing this, Bill. Now.

1467
01:13:20,889 --> 01:13:24,127
Energy readings show they
have not used the tunnel yet.

1468
01:13:24,129 --> 01:13:25,197
We don't have much time before

1469
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:26,466
Mom's location shifts,
and we lose her.

1470
01:13:26,468 --> 01:13:29,172
Yeah, and we have
a lot to do before then.

1471
01:13:29,174 --> 01:13:30,474
You know,
my pep-pep always said,

1472
01:13:30,476 --> 01:13:32,478
"If you want to do something
right, you make a list."

1473
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:34,014
So, we should do that.

1474
01:13:34,016 --> 01:13:36,287
One, we have to break
into that lab.

1475
01:13:36,289 --> 01:13:38,925
Two, we have to kick out
Foster and Ghost.

1476
01:13:38,927 --> 01:13:41,229
Three, we're gonna
have to fight Ghost.

1477
01:13:41,231 --> 01:13:43,633
That seems like it should be
part of two. 2-A, all right?

1478
01:13:43,635 --> 01:13:45,337
Let's call it 2-A.

1479
01:13:45,339 --> 01:13:47,039
Fight Ghost. 2-A.

1480
01:13:47,041 --> 01:13:48,409
Oh, also, we have to make sure
that the lab

1481
01:13:48,411 --> 01:13:49,947
is fully grown
for you to come back.

1482
01:13:49,949 --> 01:13:50,648
Otherwise, we're screwed.

1483
01:13:50,650 --> 01:13:52,150
Scott!

1484
01:13:52,152 --> 01:13:53,052
You want me to start again?
I'll start again...

1485
01:13:53,054 --> 01:13:54,557
I'm going to dive.

1486
01:13:56,594 --> 01:13:59,032
The only chance we got is if
the two of you are out here...

1487
01:13:59,034 --> 01:14:02,538
together, protecting the tunnel.

1488
01:14:02,540 --> 01:14:04,944
Let me do this, Hope. Please.

1489
01:14:06,415 --> 01:14:08,318
Let me get her.

1490
01:14:10,021 --> 01:14:11,557
I think he's right.

1491
01:14:18,706 --> 01:14:21,076
"Whassup?"

1492
01:14:23,415 --> 01:14:25,586
You don't remember, uh,
that beloved commercial?

1493
01:14:26,455 --> 01:14:27,690
"Whassup?"

1494
01:14:28,758 --> 01:14:31,095
I had him follow us.

1495
01:14:31,097 --> 01:14:33,567
I thought we could use
some help.

1496
01:14:35,271 --> 01:14:36,639
All right.
I'm in position.

1497
01:14:36,641 --> 01:14:38,141
The ants are headed in.

1498
01:14:38,143 --> 01:14:39,444
<i><font color="#80ffff">Copy that.</i></font>

1499
01:14:39,446 --> 01:14:40,846
<i><font color="#80ffff">Keep your eyes peeled, Scotty.</i></font>

1500
01:14:41,150 --> 01:14:44,320
- Do you want Pez?
- No.

1501
01:14:44,322 --> 01:14:46,292
Cassie gave me this
for my birthday.

1502
01:14:46,294 --> 01:14:48,264
By the way, I love that suit!

1503
01:14:48,732 --> 01:14:50,369
Thanks, man.

1504
01:14:50,736 --> 01:14:53,606
I wish I had a suit.

1505
01:14:53,608 --> 01:14:58,114
I would even like a suit
with minimal powers, you know?

1506
01:14:58,116 --> 01:15:01,389
Or maybe even just a suit,
with no powers.

1507
01:15:16,387 --> 01:15:17,389
What is it?

1508
01:15:18,290 --> 01:15:20,227
Don't know.

1509
01:15:24,169 --> 01:15:25,237
It's them!

1510
01:15:28,178 --> 01:15:29,246
They can't be far.

1511
01:15:50,220 --> 01:15:53,425
All right, Hank. Hank?

1512
01:15:55,431 --> 01:15:57,233
Dad, what's your status?

1513
01:15:57,235 --> 01:15:58,903
Foster's taken care of.

1514
01:15:58,905 --> 01:16:00,474
Suiting up now.

1515
01:16:05,184 --> 01:16:07,220
I just wanted to save Ava.

1516
01:16:07,222 --> 01:16:09,823
She's facing death or
something far more terrible.

1517
01:16:09,825 --> 01:16:10,825
She's afraid.

1518
01:16:11,864 --> 01:16:14,767
I'll help you find a cure
when I get back.

1519
01:16:14,769 --> 01:16:16,671
I promise.

1520
01:16:16,673 --> 01:16:19,177
Together, we'll figure
something out.

1521
01:16:21,282 --> 01:16:22,684
Good luck, Hank.

1522
01:16:23,387 --> 01:16:25,722
Thanks, Bill.

1523
01:16:25,724 --> 01:16:28,396
Now, I'm gonna need you
to step back.

1524
01:16:45,633 --> 01:16:48,837
<i><font color="#80ffff">Time remaining, 15 minutes.</i></font>

1525
01:16:50,575 --> 01:16:51,974
<i><font color="#80ffff">Hank's in, Scott.</i></font>

1526
01:16:51,976 --> 01:16:52,944
<i><font color="#80ffff">Any sign of her?</i></font>

1527
01:16:52,946 --> 01:16:54,281
No, nothing yet.

1528
01:17:00,327 --> 01:17:01,429
Ava!

1529
01:17:04,334 --> 01:17:06,471
Call off the ants, Scott.

1530
01:17:06,473 --> 01:17:07,473
Oh, boy!

1531
01:17:31,522 --> 01:17:32,556
Can I get a status report?

1532
01:17:32,558 --> 01:17:34,358
'Cause I got some
serious Ghost problems here!

1533
01:17:37,534 --> 01:17:38,534
Ready to dive.

1534
01:17:45,584 --> 01:17:47,718
- In case I don't make it...
<i><font color="#80ffff">- Don't.</i></font>

1535
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:48,955
Don't say that.

1536
01:17:49,692 --> 01:17:51,694
<i><font color="#80ffff">I can't lose you, too.</i></font>

01:17:51,696 --> 01:17:52,696
I love you, Hope.

1538
01:17:54,735 --> 01:17:56,738
Guys,
everything's bad over here.

1539
01:18:12,870 --> 01:18:13,873
Now.

1540
01:18:23,959 --> 01:18:25,596
Misdirection.

1541
01:18:25,598 --> 01:18:26,963
One of the first things
they teach you

1542
01:18:26,965 --> 01:18:29,137
at Online Close-up
Magic University.

1543
01:18:31,107 --> 01:18:32,110
No!

1544
01:18:35,717 --> 01:18:36,986
Plan worked.
We got it, Scotty!

1545
01:18:38,223 --> 01:18:39,256
Meet us at the rendezvous point.

1546
01:18:39,258 --> 01:18:40,859
Okay, on my way!

1547
01:18:40,861 --> 01:18:41,861
Oh, no.

1548
01:18:45,638 --> 01:18:48,038
Really?
This guy again?

1549
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:49,274
Who?

1550
01:18:49,276 --> 01:18:51,480
I told you
our business wasn't over.

1551
01:18:53,553 --> 01:18:54,586
Change of plans.

1552
01:18:58,027 --> 01:18:59,030
Hang on.

1553
01:19:08,583 --> 01:19:10,586
I want that lab, boys,
whatever it takes.

1554
01:19:20,039 --> 01:19:21,040
Hold on.

1555
01:19:35,268 --> 01:19:37,038
That undercarriage is filthy!

1556
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:38,276
Oh, they got bigger problems.

1557
01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:44,854
Hope, what're you doing?

1558

01:22:34,392 --> 01:22:35,394
Oh, that's not good.

1582
01:22:38,968 --> 01:22:40,470
Hope!

1583
01:22:46,148 --> 01:22:47,148
- No!
- No!

1584
01:22:52,528 --> 01:22:53,628
There it is, right there.
Get the lab!

1585
01:22:53,630 --> 01:22:54,665
Get the lab!

1586
01:23:04,050 --> 01:23:06,021
I've got her.
Westbound on Fremont.

1587
01:23:08,626 --> 01:23:11,195
Hope! Wait!

1588
01:23:11,197 --> 01:23:12,499
Hey, what about me?

1589
01:23:21,318 --> 01:23:22,620
We got you now, Ava!

1590
01:23:23,222 --> 01:23:25,658
Whoa! Oh!

1591
01:23:49,241 --> 01:23:50,508
Not again!

1592
01:23:52,280 --> 01:23:53,516
Piece of junk!

1593
01:23:56,857 --> 01:23:58,359
Ah! Yes!

1594
01:24:00,663 --> 01:24:02,299
Go, go, go, go, go!

1595
01:24:04,338 --> 01:24:06,208
Burch got the lab.

1596
01:24:06,742 --> 01:24:08,513
I'm going after him.

Guys.

1606
01:26:06,547 --> 01:26:09,752
Don't you need the remote
to the lab? I just found it.

1607
01:26:09,754 --> 01:26:10,755
We can't grow
the lab without it.

1608
01:26:10,757 --> 01:26:12,091
Get it to us fast.

1609
01:26:12,093 --> 01:26:13,559
Yeah, but the van is busted.

1610
01:26:13,561 --> 01:26:15,081
Use the Hot Wheels Rally case.

1611
01:26:17,704 --> 01:26:18,706
What?

1612
01:26:24,116 --> 01:26:26,452
I love you, Dr. Pym.

1613
01:26:26,454 --> 01:26:27,788
The remote!
We're missing the remote!

Awesome!

Right. I'll get the lab.

Hi.

1622

Oh, that's badass!

1623
01:27:27,008 --> 01:27:28,109
Nice.

1624
01:27:37,629 --> 01:27:38,629

1625

Come here, you little weasel!

1626

No, you don't!

1627

I guess maybe you do.

Come on!

1629
01:28:06,385 --> 01:28:09,792
Anyone see a Southern
gentleman carrying a building?

1630
01:28:13,934 --> 01:28:16,873
How'd he even have time
to buy a ticket?

1631
01:28:16,875 --> 01:28:19,342
Would you just one time,

Yes!

1634
01:28:23,187 --> 01:28:24,187
All right, I need help.

1635
01:28:25,692 --> 01:28:26,692
Yes!

1636
01:28:27,696 --> 01:28:29,799
Oh. Sorry. Ah...

1637
01:28:30,434 --> 01:28:31,801
Somebody!

1638

It's okay. It's okay!

Sorry, I know I'm not a whale.

01:36:09,648 --> 01:36:11,328
No, no, no, no!

1741
01:36:14,057 --> 01:36:15,123
Thanks, guys.

1742
01:36:21,973 --> 01:36:22,973
Ava?

1743
01:36:23,643 --> 01:36:25,345
Ava!

1744
01:36:28,250 --> 01:36:29,621
Ava!

1745
01:36:29,623 --> 01:36:31,122
Almost ready for extraction.

1746
01:36:31,124 --> 01:36:33,761
Please, stop!
People are getting hurt!

1747
01:36:33,763 --> 01:36:36,233
Everything hurts.
Don't talk to me about pain!

1748
01:36:36,235 --> 01:36:37,968
What if Hank is right?

1749
01:36:37,970 --> 01:36:39,806
What if this process
kills Janet?

1750
01:36:39,808 --> 01:36:41,242
What, you're worried about her?

1751
01:36:41,244 --> 01:36:43,113
All I'm saying is that she is
a brilliant scientist.

1752
01:36:43,115 --> 01:36:44,682
She may be able to help.

1753
01:36:44,684 --> 01:36:47,320
Oh, she will help.
Right now!

1754
01:36:47,322 --> 01:36:49,324
And if she dies, she dies!

1755
01:36:49,326 --> 01:36:52,197
No, no. I'm sorry,
we can't do this.

1756
01:36:52,199 --> 01:36:54,003
We have to find another way.

1757
01:36:57,142 --> 01:36:59,144
This is the way.

1758
01:37:20,289 --> 01:37:21,724
Janet!

1759
01:37:32,748 --> 01:37:34,047
She started the extraction.

1760
01:37:34,049 --> 01:37:35,852
She's gonna tear Mom apart.

1761
01:37:45,004 --> 01:37:46,007
No!

1762
01:38:20,541 --> 01:38:21,741
Hope!

1763
01:38:38,510 --> 01:38:39,880
Are you okay?

1764
01:38:54,477 --> 01:38:56,280
Mom?

1765
01:39:04,330 --> 01:39:05,632
Oh, my God.

1766
01:39:10,976 --> 01:39:12,344
We found you.

1767
01:39:16,352 --> 01:39:18,588
I missed you so much.

1768
01:39:18,590 --> 01:39:20,628
I missed you too, Jellybean.

1769
01:39:23,567 --> 01:39:24,734
It's okay.

1770
01:39:24,736 --> 01:39:27,941
I'm here now.
We have time.

1771
01:39:30,013 --> 01:39:31,983
No more last-minute
business trips, okay?

1772
01:39:32,284 --> 01:39:34,354
I promise.

1773
01:39:34,356 --> 01:39:35,724
No, it's okay!

1774
01:39:35,726 --> 01:39:37,459
It's all right.
Just don't worry about me.

1775
01:39:37,461 --> 01:39:39,197
- I'll be fine.
- Dad.

1776
01:39:44,375 --> 01:39:46,343
Scott.

1777
01:39:46,345 --> 01:39:48,016
Miss Van Dyne.

1778
01:39:49,387 --> 01:39:51,355
It's nice to...

1779
01:39:51,357 --> 01:39:52,756
Well, I guess we've already met.

1780
01:39:52,758 --> 01:39:55,128
Yeah. I guess we have.

1781
01:39:58,169 --> 01:39:59,172
Wait.

1782
01:40:07,688 --> 01:40:09,057
Your pain.

1783
01:40:11,129 --> 01:40:12,264
I can feel it.

1784
01:40:14,836 --> 01:40:16,106
It hurts.

1785
01:40:18,443 --> 01:40:20,114
It always hurts.

1786
01:40:23,253 --> 01:40:24,554
I'm sorry.

1787
01:40:27,695 --> 01:40:29,764
I think I can help you.

1788
01:41:04,268 --> 01:41:05,803
Did you know she could do that?

1789
01:41:09,277 --> 01:41:10,879
It's okay.

1790
01:41:13,553 --> 01:41:14,721
Guys, the cops are coming!

1791
01:41:15,223 --> 01:41:16,223
Whoa.

1792
01:41:18,297 --> 01:41:21,600
The cops are coming.
Like, all of 'em!

1793
01:41:21,602 --> 01:41:23,239
- I gotta go.
- We gotta go!

1794
01:41:24,340 --> 01:41:25,610
What about them?

1795
01:41:28,650 --> 01:41:30,786
Hands in the air!

1796
01:41:30,788 --> 01:41:33,358
- No! We are going to our jobs.
- No.

1797
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:35,360
You see, we see these guys.
They trying to shoot people.

1798
01:41:35,362 --> 01:41:38,734
So we apprehended them.
For you. You're welcome.

1799
01:41:38,736 --> 01:41:40,939
We traffic in stolen technology.

1800
01:41:40,941 --> 01:41:42,775
And we have killed many,
many people.

1801
01:41:42,777 --> 01:41:44,578
Uh, he's in charge.

1802
01:41:44,580 --> 01:41:45,580
That's true, I am.

1803
01:41:46,419 --> 01:41:47,417
I've also committed

1804
01:41:47,419 --> 01:41:49,789
numerous health code
violations in my restaurant.

1805
01:41:49,791 --> 01:41:51,795
Some of them would shock you.

1806
01:41:54,936 --> 01:41:57,307
It is truth serum.

1807
01:42:01,482 --> 01:42:03,016
We gotta get outta here.

1808
01:42:03,018 --> 01:42:04,620
Fast.

1809
01:42:05,790 --> 01:42:07,959
I have an idea.

1810
01:42:07,961 --> 01:42:09,061
<i><font color="#80ffff">Giant figure, now spotted</i></font>

1811
01:42:09,063 --> 01:42:10,564
<i><font color="#80ffff">at the intersection of
Broadway and Laguna.</i></font>

1812
01:42:10,566 --> 01:42:11,832
<i><font color="#80ffff">All units move in.</i></font>

1813
01:42:11,834 --> 01:42:13,436
Go, go!

1814
01:42:16,446 --> 01:42:17,681
There he is!

1815
01:42:22,892 --> 01:42:24,725
It's over, Scotty!

1816
01:42:24,727 --> 01:42:27,698
I'm sorry, but we got you, man!

1817
01:42:27,700 --> 01:42:29,703
Come on.
It's the end of the line, pal.

1818
01:42:29,705 --> 01:42:30,705
There's nowhere to hide.

1819
01:42:32,811 --> 01:42:35,750
Just pull off that Band-Aid!
You lost! It's okay!

1820
01:42:37,655 --> 01:42:39,925
Damn it, Scotty,
reduce yourself!

1821
01:42:46,036 --> 01:42:47,606
Magic.

1822
01:42:49,811 --> 01:42:50,979
Damn it!

1823
01:42:50,981 --> 01:42:52,718
Get to Lang's, now!

1824
01:42:59,397 --> 01:43:01,399
Well done, honey.

1825
01:43:01,401 --> 01:43:02,736
Let's go!

1826
01:43:10,888 --> 01:43:12,052
Leave me here.

1827
01:43:12,054 --> 01:43:13,489
We can make it.

1828
01:43:13,491 --> 01:43:14,491
You said it yourself.

1829
01:43:15,797 --> 01:43:17,966
I've hurt people.

1830
01:43:17,968 --> 01:43:19,804
But you haven't.

1831
01:43:19,806 --> 01:43:21,672
Go. Please!

1832
01:43:21,674 --> 01:43:22,776
We can make it, Ava.

1833
01:43:23,477 --> 01:43:24,712
Bill...

1834
01:43:25,583 --> 01:43:26,918
I'm not leaving you.

1835
01:44:10,705 --> 01:44:12,740
Oh, hey, guys.

1836
01:44:12,742 --> 01:44:14,480
Are my two years up already?

1837
01:44:21,294 --> 01:44:23,329
What's it like out there?

1838
01:44:23,331 --> 01:44:26,734
Huh? I mean,
do people still dance?

1839
01:44:26,736 --> 01:44:29,006
Are food trucks still a thing?

1840
01:44:29,008 --> 01:44:30,944
Well, you got away with it
this time, Scott...

1841
01:44:30,946 --> 01:44:33,984
but, uh,
I'll be seeing you again.

1842
01:44:34,218 --> 01:44:35,218
Where?

1843
01:44:36,156 --> 01:44:37,222
Huh?

1844
01:44:37,224 --> 01:44:38,861
Where will you be
seeing me again?

1845
01:44:39,862 --> 01:44:43,337
Like, in general...

1846
01:44:43,339 --> 01:44:45,206
The next time
you do something bad,

1847
01:44:45,208 --> 01:44:46,841
- I'll be there to catch you...
- Oh.

1848
01:44:46,843 --> 01:44:49,113
You'll be watching...

1849
01:44:49,115 --> 01:44:51,151
I thought you were
inviting me somewhere.

1850
01:44:52,155 --> 01:44:54,224
Why would I do that?

1851
01:44:54,226 --> 01:44:56,761
That's what I was wondering,
why would you do that?

1852
01:44:56,763 --> 01:44:58,231
Like a party, or like,
dinner or something?

1853
01:44:58,233 --> 01:45:00,336
I don't know. I thought you
planned the evening.

1854
01:45:00,338 --> 01:45:01,872
I meant, "I'll arrest you
later, again."

1855
01:45:01,874 --> 01:45:03,041
Of course,
that would be strange.

1856
01:45:03,043 --> 01:45:04,845
- Take it easy, Jimmy.
- Okay.

1857
01:45:06,049 --> 01:45:07,685
Did you want to grab dinner,
or something?

1858
01:45:07,687 --> 01:45:09,788
I mean, because I'm free...

1859
01:45:09,790 --> 01:45:11,159
Yeah. Come on.

1860
01:45:20,713 --> 01:45:21,444
You ready?

1861
01:45:21,446 --> 01:45:22,648
Yeah!

1862
01:45:24,754 --> 01:45:26,156
- Hi.
- Hi. Hi.

1863
01:45:27,325 --> 01:45:29,694
Oh!

1864
01:45:29,696 --> 01:45:31,865
Yes, that was us.
How can I help you?

1865
01:45:32,736 --> 01:45:33,736
X-Con Security.

1866
01:45:35,040 --> 01:45:36,043
Mr. Karapetyan?

1867
01:45:36,876 --> 01:45:39,014
Yeah, you saw that?

1868
01:45:39,016 --> 01:45:42,988
It would be an honor to be
in business with you as well.

1869
01:45:42,990 --> 01:45:44,430
I'll see you Thursday,
9:00 AM. Okay.

1870
01:45:45,360 --> 01:45:46,962
Yeah!

1871
01:45:46,964 --> 01:45:49,201
That's how you close a deal!

1872
01:46:17,558 --> 01:46:19,261
This is awesome.

1873
01:46:20,030 --> 01:46:21,565
So, Cassie...

1874
01:46:21,567 --> 01:46:23,568
what do you want to be
when you grow up?

1875
01:46:23,570 --> 01:46:25,572
I wanna help people...

1876
01:46:25,574 --> 01:46:26,574
like my dad.

1877
01:46:27,477 --> 01:46:28,480
Really?

1878
01:46:30,049 --> 01:46:31,885
I wanted to be his partner.

1879
01:46:31,887 --> 01:46:33,255
But he said he wants you.

1880
01:46:34,458 --> 01:46:35,460
Is that so?

1881
01:46:40,336 --> 01:46:41,505
Daddy!

1882
01:46:42,541 --> 01:46:44,444
Whoa! Hold on.

1883
01:46:44,446 --> 01:46:46,515
Move, get outta here!

1884
01:46:46,517 --> 01:46:48,517
Scott, don't, don't, don't!

1885
01:46:48,519 --> 01:46:50,590
Ow.

1886
01:46:50,592 --> 01:46:52,859
Oh, gross!

1887
01:46:52,861 --> 01:46:55,297
Ugh. I hate that moth dust!

1888
01:46:55,299 --> 01:46:59,039
Go! Shoo! Shoo!

1889
01:49:06,393 --> 01:49:08,529
I used to be
a respected scientist.

1890
01:49:08,531 --> 01:49:11,470
I had my name
on the sides of buildings.

1891
01:49:11,771 --> 01:49:13,773
Now, I got this.

1892
01:49:13,775 --> 01:49:16,880
Well, you wanted
a smaller quantum tunnel.

1893
01:49:16,882 --> 01:49:19,653
This is... smaller.

1894
01:49:20,889 --> 01:49:24,328
Oh. Sorry. My bad.

1895
01:49:24,330 --> 01:49:26,365
Ah, I think it has flair.

1896
01:49:27,737 --> 01:49:29,441
All right. Control's online.

1897
01:49:33,214 --> 01:49:35,551
The collection unit activates
when you decouple it.

1898
01:49:35,553 --> 01:49:37,220
It should automatically
start absorbing

1899
01:49:37,222 --> 01:49:38,957
quantum healing particles.

1900
01:49:38,959 --> 01:49:41,730
Also, make sure you stay
out of the tardigrade fields.

1901
01:49:41,732 --> 01:49:43,432
They're cute,
but they'll eat you.

1902
01:49:43,434 --> 01:49:45,336
And don't get sucked
