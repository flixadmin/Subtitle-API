SEPTEMBER 2020

2
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:43,667
To your places.

3
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:45,884
Prepare to shoot.

4
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,207
Units in position.

5
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:49,548
Report, please.

6
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,393
Unidentified creature reported.
Stay on high alert.

7
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:23,289
- It's out, sir!
- Is it human?

8
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:24,754
I can't tell, sir.

9
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:26,674
I can't see clearly because of the snow.

10
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:00,869
Moving in for closer visual.

11
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:08,922
It looks human!

12
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:15,678
Visibility is compromised.

13
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,550
Remain on standby
until visual is confirmed.

14
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:24,983
It keeps approaching, sir!
What should we do?

15
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:26,401
Units on standby at the bridge.

16
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,767
Standby to shoot.

17
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,653
Do not approach.

18
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:33,574
If you don't stop, we will shoot.

19
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:34,863
Alpha Team is ready, over.

20
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,450
Snipers in position.

21
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,830
Visual confirmed.

22
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:40,739
Ready to fire.

23
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:43,333
Fire!

24
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:21,616
Someone once said

25
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:24,655
that even the thickest darkness

26
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:27,286
disappears with the faintest light.

27
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:41,258
This is a story about us,

28
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,056
the ones trying to find

29
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:44,813
a reason to live

30
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:48,516
in a world where this is even harder

31
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:50,233
than merely surviving.

32
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,545
ORIGINAL STORY SWEET HOME
BY CARNBY KIM AND YOUNGCHAN HWANG

33
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,670
AUGUST 2020

34
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:51,788
CANCEL THE REDEVELOPMENT

35
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:55,594
INELIGIBLE UNION MEMBERS HAVE NO SAY
IN GREEN HOME REDEVELOPMENT

36
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:59,220
PROTECT OUR RIGHT TO LIVE
GREEN HOME RESIDENTS

37
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:43,378
Oh, my goodness. That was close.

38
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,845
I don't know how that flew
all the way over there.

39
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:50,523
I'm sorry. This isn't my job,

40
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,600
but they said nobody else
could work on the weekend.

41
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,766
People here think security guards
are slaves or something...

42
00:05:57,982 --> 00:05:58,982
Well, anyway...

43
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,027
Excuse me.

44
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:02,704
I haven't seen you before.

45
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:03,699
What brings you here?

46
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,620
I moved...

47
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:09,159
What? I can't hear you.
Can you speak louder?

48
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:11,325
I moved here.

49
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:12,868
Moved?

50
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:17,246
I heard somebody was moving
into Room 1410. I guess that's you.

51
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:18,205
Are you living alone?

52
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:20,629
Yes.

53
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:23,513
What? I can't hear you.

54
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,264
I'm living alone.

55
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:27,758
Right.

56
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,596
BEAUTIFUL AND CLEAN
GREEN HOME MANAGEMENT OFFICE

57
00:06:58,292 --> 00:06:59,592
Should I just die?

58
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,123
Mister!

59
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:34,038
Oh, right.

60
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,163
You're always sleeping.

61
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:39,207
- Do you ever work?
- I'm sorry.

62
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:40,997
Take the bed out.

63
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,170
Pardon?

64
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:46,094
Someone made a complaint about the bed.

65
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,934
That bed is why you're not focused on work

66
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,009
and dozing off all day.

67
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:52,394
Well, but then how would I get any rest?

68
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:55,184
I'm telling you not to rest.

69
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,476
Got that?

70
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,145
Why can't he understand anything?

71
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:05,485
He's so loud and uncultured.

72
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:06,778
Oh, hello.

73
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:10,615
Don't mind him.
He just never learned any manners.

74
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,411
But you know, I used to live in Gangnam.

75
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:18,253
None of the security guards there
had beds in their offices.

76
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,871
Pardon?

77
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,456
I'm just saying.

78
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:24,251
But what brings you here?

79
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:27,507
Oh, this. Someone sent me some fish.

80
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,760
But you know, I only eat yellow corvinas.

81
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:32,932
You can have these.

82
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,852
You really didn't have to.
Thank you so much.

83
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,766
You know the term
"noblesse oblige," right?

84
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:43,605
- Have a nice day.
- Right. Thank you, ma'am.

85
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,729
I'll enjoy these. Thank you!

86
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:44,773
Fucking hell.

87
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,146
Damn it.

88
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:56,701
Hey!

89
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,041
Was this you?

90
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,038
No.

91
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:08,709
Maybe it was the gangster guy.

92
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:10,877
Did you see who did it?

93
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,471
No.

94
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,310
Do you want one?

95
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,690
No.

96
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:32,607
Are you a loner?

97
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:43,203
I thought handsome guys
couldn't be loners.

98
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,909
Maybe you're just an asshole.

99
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:52,672
Don't die here.

100
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:59,136
You'll just cause trouble
for a lot of people here.

101
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,144
Find somewhere else to die.

102
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,414
What are you doing?

103
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:26,246
I asked you to come by the office,
but I guess you forgot.

104
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:28,368
You need to fill out
a registration document.

105
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,294
I'll go later.

106
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:48,676
I'm sorry about earlier.

107
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:50,897
Here.

108
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:55,024
All right.

109
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,457
Yes, Mom.

110
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,553
I'll go back if I fail this audition.

111
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:22,722
How many times do I have to tell you?
This is the last one.

112
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:24,965
Don't take back your word.

113
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,684
I'll get accepted for sure this time.

114
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:27,774
A sponsorship?

115
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:30,268
I'm not going to be a prostitute. Okay?

116
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,941
- Hello.
- Right.

117
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,192
I'm so hungry.

118
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:37,021
I'm doing all this to earn a living,
but I might starve to death.

119
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:42,613
What? Why am I suddenly
getting a nosebleed?

120
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:13,061
- What do you think?
- It sucks.

121
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:15,813
Are you really going to perform there?
Don't you have any pride?

122
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:17,516
Hey, my pride's not making me any money.

123
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,687
And they're paying me a lot.

124
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:23,985
I could sell my soul
for that kind of money.

125
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:27,199
Hey, I have to go to work. Bye.

126
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,318
I guess you just moved here.

127
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,323
Yes, I came just a week ago.

128
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:06,241
Sorry I didn't introduce
myself earlier. I'm in Room 1510.

129
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,702
It's nice to meet you.

130
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:10,741
Oh, dear! It's okay, Da-eun.

131
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:12,326
She's just a neighbor.

132
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:14,365
Sorry.

133
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,669
I guess I was a little loud.

134
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,750
I might have a lot to be sorry about
in the future, though.

135
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,415
It's all right.

136
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,635
How old is your baby?

137
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:32,010
My little princess is just one year old.

138
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,389
Hello!

139
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:40,813
Isn't she pretty?

140
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,605
Yes, she is.

141
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:01,377
Aren't you getting in?

142
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:03,249
Oh, I...

143
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:05,877
forgot my wallet at home.

144
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:13,931
I'll wait for you.

145
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:15,636
No, it's fine. Go ahead.

146
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:31,317
What's wrong with her?

147
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,448
It's all right. She's a kind person.

148
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,879
She lost her baby last year.

149
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,750
They say her stroller

150
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,087
rolled into the street
when she wasn't looking.

151
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:51,842
That's so sad.

152
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:00,640
God sometimes gives us hardships
that are hard to overcome.

153
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,435
But failing to overcome them

154
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,982
doesn't mean you should be criticized

155
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:08,153
or feared by others for it.

156
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:10,445
Yes. You're right.

157
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,569
Everything is God's will.

158
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:15,952
It's nice to meet you.

159
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,195
I'm Jung Jae-heon. I live in Room 1506.

160
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:26,088
Am I being overly friendly?

161
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,210
No, it's just that

162
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:31,223
my hand reeks of cigarettes.

163
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,220
Oh, all right.

164
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:34,682
I'm Yoon Ji-su.

165
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,270
I guess you play the guitar.

166
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:43,562
I play the bass.

167
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:45,114
Oh, right.

168
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:49,151
What do you do, then?

169
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,855
I'm a Korean language teacher.

170
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:58,536
I have a Bible because I'm going
to church today. Since it's Sunday.

171
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,157
- That's nice.
- Right.

172
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:03,667
THE HOLY BIBLE

173
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,000
I'm not a missionary or anything.

174
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,257
Right. I get it.

175
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,047
- Bye, then.
- Bye.

176
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,502
Don't come in.

177
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,965
- Your lesson fees.
- I already paid for them.

178
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,299
- Where did you get the money?
- I met a rich guy.

179
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:02,637
Tell me the truth.

180
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:06,727
If I tell you

181
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,112
would anything change?

182
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,151
Why are you so damn nosy?

183
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,279
I just yanked out the whiskers!

184
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:20,584
And then I skinned it with my knife.

185
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,869
Look. This is it.

186
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:25,205
You see this?

187
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:28,249
Did you catch this snake, too?

188
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,093
What are you talking about?
Oh, what's that?

189
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,251
It's a snake!

190
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,842
What are you doing?

191
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:38,085
- Hey!
- What? Is that a snake?

192
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,257
- What?
- Sir...

193
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,345
Oh, my gosh!

194
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:59,528
Hey! Get ready!

195
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,669
Why are you doing this to me?

196
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:13,211
I didn't do anything!

197
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:17,128
- Hey, this is dangerous.
- I don't know what it is,

198
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:18,973
but I'm sorry.

199
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,005
I won't report this.

200
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:25,846
I won't tell anyone about this.

201
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:37,992
Are you really going to leave?

202
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:41,528
Don't you remember?

203
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:43,617
When you were a fourth grader...

204
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,750
What? What is that?

205
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,810
Please don't kill me.

206
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:10,271
I'm trying.

207
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,640
CONGRATULATIONS!

208
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:55,358
YOU'VE BEEN CHOSEN TO BE A TESTER
FOR THE REMAKE OF LAST WORLD

209
00:21:57,607 --> 00:22:00,187
COME TO THE FAN FESTIVAL
AT G-TOWER ON AUGUST 25TH

210
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:05,486
AUGUST

211
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:11,122
NAME OF EVENT

212
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:23,467
AUGUST 25TH, TUESDAY
SUICIDE

213
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,720
DO NOT ENTER

214
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,760
What is this?

215
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,760
Is he unemployed?

216
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:09,216
He does look like a gangster, though.

217
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:13,847
Do you even pay rent?

218
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:16,854
Go and ask questions at school.

219
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:24,398
I got kicked out

220
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,528
for setting the school on fire.

221
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,887
It's been a week since I moved here.

222
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:55,056
I've only eaten ramyeon,
so I don't feel well.

223
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,439
But that doesn't matter.

224
00:23:58,061 --> 00:23:59,351
I'm going to kill myself anyway.

225
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,690
OPEN

226
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,070
This is so hard. I didn't lose any weight.

227
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,026
This is so irritating.

228
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:10,949
Hey, Kitty.

229
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:14,332
I'm starving, but you're eating
as much as you want.

230
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:18,874
Hello? Oh, hi!

231
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:23,587
Oh, it's all right. Maybe next time...

232
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,050
Drinks?

233
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,300
Yes, I enjoy drinking.

234
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:28,879
All right, call me anytime.

235
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:30,637
I KEEP HEARING THINGS
AND GETTING NOSEBLEEDS

236
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:33,349
Damn it. What do I do?

237
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,100
SHOULD I SEE A DOCTOR?
IT'S REALLY SERIOUS.

238
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:38,765
Damn it...

239
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:49,451
WHAT THE HELL, WHO SAID TO LEAVE?

240
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:50,409
THAT PRICK EVEN MOVED

241
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,070
BECAUSE HIS PARENTS DIED

242
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,408
REST IN PEACE

243
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,750
HE'S THE ONLY ONE WHO SURVIVED

244
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:58,078
FIGURES

245
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:02,423
DON'T DIE UNTIL WE ALLOW YOU TO

246
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:06,127
YOU PRICK

247
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:24,977
THE SECURITY GUARD WASN'T IN
SO I LEFT YOUR PACKAGE AT THE DOOR

248
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:27,442
RAMYEON

249
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,334
What the hell?

250
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:15,908
Hungry...

251
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:41,847
Excuse me.

252
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,063
Are you in?

253
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:45,482
Please help me.

254
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:47,942
I'm so scared. Please help me.

255
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:50,395
Is there nobody home?

256
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:55,034
Please. Help me.

257
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:57,663
Please.

258
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:00,539
Hello?

259
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:02,788
Please help me.

260
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,790
I'm scared.

261
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:21,013
Hello?

262
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:23,845
Are you okay?

263
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:27,978
You're home.

264
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:29,563
Did something happen?

265
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:32,646
I just came home,

266
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,571
and the door was open,

267
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,573
and it was a mess inside.

268
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,565
And my cat is gone.

269
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:41,201
The floor...

270
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:44,075
It was covered in blood.

271
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,629
Please, help me.

272
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,245
Okay, calm down.

273
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:54,512
I'll call the police.

274
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:02,933
Can't you stay with me?

275
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:11,265
What's going on?

276
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,784
Please...

277
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:19,493
Hang on.

278
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:21,873
Please, can you open the door?

279
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:24,329
I'm so scared.

280
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:27,041
Please, can you stay with me? Please?

281
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,042
Please.

282
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:31,629
Please open the door.

283
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,879
Open the door. Please.

284
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,173
Please open the door.

285
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:39,628
Well...

286
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:43,097
Can you show me your arms?

287
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,680
What?

288
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:48,642
Your arms.

289
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,438
Show me your arms.

290
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:53,399
What did you say?

291
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:55,573
Your arms.

292
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,698
Show me your arms.

293
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:02,658
I told you to open the door! Open it!

294
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:07,446
Open the door!

295
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:10,003
You asshole!

296
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,426
It's blood.

297
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:13,018
There's a lot of blood.

298
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:17,521
Did you

299
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:19,938
see a weird woman just now?

300
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,710
Jeez.

301
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,130
I shouldn't have played so much.

302
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,419
Coming.

303
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:43,415
You must be pretty angry.

304
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:47,968
I'm sorry. I sometimes get
really inspired at night, so...

305
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:51,267
- I'm hungry.
- What?

306
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:55,186
Open the door!

307
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:57,612
Your face...

308
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,069
Did you hurt yourself?

309
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:02,614
I'll be quiet!

310
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:05,284
I told you I'm sorry.
You're being a bit harsh!

311
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:09,374
Open the door!

312
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:14,043
I'm hungry!

313
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:21,551
Damn it...

314
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:53,374
SPORTS MEDICINE
MATH

315
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:00,592
I'm going to work now.

316
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:02,959
Don't just eat ramyeon, okay?

317
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:04,336
BASTARD

318
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:05,882
Eat a proper meal, all right?

319
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:08,505
And if you're not home later,
I'm reporting you missing.

320
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:13,385
Just report me as dead.

321
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:14,893
You're smothering me as it is.

322
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:22,018
LEE EUN-HYEOK
KEEP OUT

323
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,030
UNDER MAINTENANCE

324
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,790
UNDER MAINTENANCE

325
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:51,221
Some woman was banging on the door,

326
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:53,052
and she had blood all over her face.

327
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:55,144
She seemed hurt, but she was so angry

328
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:56,983
and she was banging
on the door really hard...

329
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:05,437
You don't think she jumped, do you?

330
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,202
She wasn't just banging.

331
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:17,584
She was ramming into the door.

332
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:35,556
Damn it. I'm late.

333
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:40,688
What's going on?

334
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:43,649
Where's the security guard?

335
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,020
My daughter hasn't come home yet.

336
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,320
Who lowered the shutters?

337
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:51,069
Excuse me.

338
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,700
Does your cell have service?

339
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:02,537
I guess not.

340
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,670
What's going on here?

341
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,920
- Did you just come down?
- Yes.

342
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:13,548
Didn't you see anything strange
on the way?

343
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:17,055
- Like what?
- Never mind.

344
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:18,508
I asked what's going on.

345
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,350
We're trying to find out.

346
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:27,857
The back doors and the parking lot doors
are locked as well.

347
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,204
Are you saying we're locked in?

348
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:38,945
Someone may have locked us in.

349
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:42,247
Hey!

350
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:43,999
Hey!

351
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:48,208
- Hey!
- Honey, just wait.

352
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:50,344
- Isn't anyone inside?
- Honey...

353
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:52,301
Ma'am, we can't just sit around

354
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:54,431
and wait forever. This is so annoying.

355
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:57,349
These jerks are going to ruin
our business. Damn it.

356
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:58,718
Honey...

357
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:00,767
I took photos

358
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:01,678
as evidence.

359
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,520
Is it still not open yet?

360
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:05,233
What...

361
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:07,727
Wait!

362
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:09,396
What are you doing?

363
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:11,192
Move if you're not going to help.

364
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:13,605
We'll have to pay to get the door fixed!

365
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:16,414
- Are you going to pay for it all?
- Excuse me.

366
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:18,699
Who's that? Hey! What the heck?

367
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:21,044
Oh, watch out!

368
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:25,754
Are you okay, sir?

369
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:27,749
Your hair.

370
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:33,965
That little jerk.

371
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:36,799
MANAGEMENT OFFICE

372
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:42,769
So they went home? I can't believe them...

373
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:45,269
Hello, this is Firefighter Seo Yi-kyung...

374
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:48,191
Every operator is currently busy
with disaster reports.

375
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:49,941
Please wait a moment.

376
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:54,694
Every operator is currently busy
with disaster reports.

377
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:56,897
- Please wait a moment.
- Landline phones must be working.

378
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:01,736
Every operator is currently busy
with disaster reports.

379
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:02,946
Please...

380
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:10,171
Did you just touch something?

381
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:13,087
Hey, you little...

382
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,591
I'm trying to open the doors!

383
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:17,012
- Put it back to how it was.
- Fine!

384
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:23,808
Maybe it wasn't that.

385
00:36:58,257 --> 00:36:59,927
Oh, whatever.

386
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:03,179
The employees will fix the phone tomorrow.

387
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:05,262
That's not the point
when we're locked in here.

388
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:07,889
Is that it?

389
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:15,861
I found the switches!

390
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:24,532
All right, now we're ready.

391
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:26,697
The shutters will go up now.
We found the switch.

392
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:27,696
- Come on.
- Let's go.

393
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:29,537
- Let's open it.
- Why were they down?

394
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:31,832
I don't know. But all we had to do
was press a button.

395
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:33,333
I guess we can go out now.

396
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:34,587
What's that?

397
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:38,708
Okay, raise the main door switch...

398
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:41,126
And press this.

399
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:51,597
What's wrong with that guy?

400
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:57,527
It's open, right?

401
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,738
You're all getting out thanks to me.

402
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:02,987
Is that blood on his mouth?

403
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:24,005
Put it back down.

404
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,311
Oh my god.

405
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:33,354
Lower the shutters!

406
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:14,058
Help...

407
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,203
Mister!

408
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:31,656
Mister!

409
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:35,621
When I signal you, lower the shutters!

410
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:41,376
Okay!

411
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:44,796
Honey!

412
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:57,274
Mister!

413
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:00,900
Lower it!

414
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:03,355
MAIN DOORS

415
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:05,652
Now!

416
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:10,372
Hurry!

417
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:51,744
Hurry! Come on!

418
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,299
Thank you.

419
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:53,797
What was that?

420
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:57,183
It wasn't human.

421
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:43,690
Is it gone?

422
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:45,059
- I don't know.
- I guess it's gone.

423
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:46,225
Go slowly.

424
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:04,539
Hey.

425
00:43:04,623 --> 00:43:05,753
I heard you're a firefighter.

426
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,423
What's the government doing?

427
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:10,803
I'm sure they'll take care of things.

428
00:43:10,879 --> 00:43:12,509
We're paying so much tax.

429
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,170
They can't even take care of one monster?

430
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:15,797
No.

431
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:18,969
It's not just one.

432
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:07,349
Protein!

433
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:21,243
What's going on?

434
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:24,036
I don't know.

435
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:26,163
Maybe the world

436
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:29,288
is finally coming to an end.
