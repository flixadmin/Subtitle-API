1
00:01:57,326 --> 00:01:58,702
(Wind howling)

2
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,871
- (Bird screeches)
- (Man shouts)

3
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:03,957
(Horse neighs)

4
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:37,824
Man 1: Look out! Man 2: Fire!

5
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:40,035
- (Men shouting)
- (Horse whinnies)

6
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,584
(Shouting continues)

7
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,633
(Horse neighing)

8
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:57,552
(Screaming)

9
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:02,974
(Coughing)

10
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:05,727
Davos: A band of 20 men, maybe less.

11
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:08,021
They were in and out
before anyone spotted them.

12
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:12,275
Burned our food stores to the ground,
all our siege weapons destroyed.

13
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,528
- Dozens of tents were...
- Horses?

14
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,822
We're still getting a count,
but hundreds are dead.

15
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:20,701
Twenty men rode into our camp
without a single guard sounding the alarm?

16
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:23,096
The northerners know more about their land
than we ever will.

17
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,480
Put last night's guards in chains.

18
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,724
Either they fell asleep
or they conspired with the enemy.

19
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:30,210
- Find out the truth and then hang them.
- Your grace.

20
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:33,588
Unless there's a thaw,
we can't press foward to winterfell

21
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:36,133
and we don't have enough food
to get us back to castle black.

22
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,968
We're not returning to castle black.

23
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:41,388
Forgive me, I never claimed
to be an expert in military matters,

24
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:45,100
but if we can't march fon/vard
and we won't march back...

25
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,866
Have the dead horses butchered for meat.

26
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,241
Man 1: Halt!

27
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:46,661
- Man 2: Halt!
- (Men coughing)

28
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,374
Man 3: There it is!

29
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,875
Open the gates.

30
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:37,796
(Rumbling)

31
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:49,099
(Baby crying)

32
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,768
Jon: It was a failure.

33
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:53,353
It wasn't.

34
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:56,773
I went to save them. I failed.

35
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,026
You didn't fail him.

36
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:02,112
Or him.

37
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,781
Or her.

38
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:08,535
Every one of them is alive
because of you and no one else.

39
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,289
I don't think that fact's lost on them.

40
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:08,887
You have a good heart.

41
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:12,057
It'll get us all killed.

42
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:20,148
Get out of my way.

43
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:42,545
(Sighs)

44
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:47,926
You sent for me?

45
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,196
Find some healthy horses
and a few knights to guard you.

46
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,700
I'm sending you back to castle black.

47
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:54,307
Tell the lord commander
his king commands him

48
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:56,977
to send food, supplies, fresh horses.

49
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,687
In return, when I take the throne,

50
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,523
I'll make sure the night's
watch has all the men it requires.

51
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:04,901
He can guard all 19 castles on the wall
if he so wishes.

52
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:10,240
You named me your hand.

53
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:11,825
Yes.

54
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,743
The king's hand should
never abandon the king,

55
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,161
especially in time of war.

56
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:17,247
You're not abandoning me.
You're obeying a command.

57
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,541
A boy with a scroll
could deliver this message.

58
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:22,210
And if Jon snow refuses
the boy with the scroll,

59
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:23,878
what does the boy say?

60
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:26,423
I didn't name you hand
for your expertize in military matters.

61
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,634
Ride for castle black.
Don't come back empty-handed.

62
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:39,728
Perhaps queen selyse
and Princess shireen could accompany me.

63
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:41,146
My family stays with me.

64
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:44,107
At least let me take shireen.

65
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,568
A siege is no place for a little girl.

66
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:48,945
My family stays with me.

67
00:08:57,579 --> 00:08:59,039
(Men coughing)

68
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:26,357
What's this one now?

69
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:30,236
The dance of dragons: A true telling
by grand maester munkun.

70
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:33,698
Now that sounds like a proper story.

71
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:36,451
Ser Byron Swann wanted
to kill the dragon vhagar.

72
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:39,014
He polished his shield for a week
so that it was like a mirror.

73
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:41,247
And he crouched behind
it and crept fonnard,

74
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:43,374
hoping the dragon
would only see its own reflection.

75
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:46,503
But the dragon saw a dumb man
holding a mirrored shield.

76
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,213
And burned him to a crisp.

77
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:49,380
(Laughs)

78
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:53,176
Thus ending the dragon-slaying career
of ser Byron Swann.

79
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,265
I made you something.

80
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:08,024
- Do you like it?
- He's beautiful.

81
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:11,903
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

82
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,447
Will you make me a Doe, too?
So that he can have company?

83
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:16,199
Of course I will.

84
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:19,244
But why am I getting a present?

85
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:22,705
Because you deserve it.

86
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:27,961
My son was always on me,
trying to teach me to read.

87
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,171
Gods, I was stubborn about it.

88
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,966
Made it this far without reading.

89
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:35,385
Seemed to me I could make it to the grave.

90
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,722
Wish I'd listened to him.

91
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,476
This is my own poor way
of saying "thank you."

92
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,274
For teaching me to be a grown-up.

93
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:54,404
I'll be gone for a few days.

94
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,532
I want to hear all about
the dance of dragons when I'm back.

95
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:59,701
You'll read it yourself.

96
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:15,592
(Birds chirping)

97
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,765
Prince doran.

98
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:25,268
Forgive us. We started without you.

99
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:28,146
Please, sit.

100
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,732
Princess myrcella.

101
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,400
Uncle.

102
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,235
What a lovely dress.

103
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:35,445
You don't like it?

104
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,155
- You must be cold.
- Not at all.

105
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,116
The dornish climate agrees with me.

106
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,995
Prince trystane.

107
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:47,290
How's yourjaw?

108
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,168
A fleabite.

109
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:51,920
What are you doing in dorne?

110
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:54,214
Looking after the safety of my niece.

111
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:57,467
And rather than send a raven
or speak to me directly,

112
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,469
you decided to enter my country in secret

113
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,721
and abduct our guest by force?

114
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:04,098
We received a threatening message.

115
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:08,019
The Princess's necklace
in the jaws of a viper.

116
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:11,356
That necklace was stolen from my room.

117
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:20,281
Oh, excellent.

118
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:22,367
A last meal before the beheading?

119
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,077
Oh, I can't behead you.

120
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,412
Many in dorne want war.

121
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,748
But I've seen war.

122
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,626
I've seen the bodies
piled on the battlefields.

123
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:34,837
I've seen the orphans
starving in the cities.

124
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:36,923
I don't want to lead
my people into that hell.

125
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,759
No, you want to break bread
with the lannisters.

126
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:43,012
And that is precisely what we are doing.

127
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:47,725
Let us drink to tommen,
the first of his name,

128
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:49,686
king of the andals and the first men,

129
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,479
lord of the seven kingdoms.

130
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:02,699
(Slams)

131
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:14,043
King tommen insists
on his sister's return to the capital?

132
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,422
I'm afraid he does.

133
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,426
I cannot disobey my king's command.

134
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,138
She will return with you to king's landing.

135
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:28,516
And my son, prince trystane,
will accompany you both.

136
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:32,312
If the alliance between
the iron throne and dome is to continue,

137
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:33,855
their engagement must stand.

138
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:35,898
Iaccept

139
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:37,358
one more thing.

140
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:41,446
My brother was named to the small council
before his death.

141
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:45,325
Your father understood the importance
of keeping dome in the fold.

142
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:46,451
With oberyn gone,

143
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:49,787
trystane will take his place
on the small council.

144
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:51,039
You have my word.

145
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:53,416
The word of a kingslayer.

146
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:59,047
No wonder you can't stand.
You have no spine.

147
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:04,093
You are mother to four of my nieces,
girls I love very much.

148
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,971
For their sake,
I hope you live a long and happy life.

149
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:09,432
Speak to me that way again, and you won't.

150
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:20,943
May I inquire as to the
fate of my man bronn?

151
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:24,072
Tell me, in king's landing,

152
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:27,325
how do they punish a commoner
who strikes a prince?

153
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:28,951
He said it was just a fleabite.

154
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:35,458
The fault is mine. Bronn is merely
a soldier following my orders.

155
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,961
If anyone should be punished, it's me.

156
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:41,964
Prince trystane must learn judgment
if he is to rule one day.

157
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,716
I'll let him decide.

158
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:51,391
I have learned the value of mercy
from my father.

159
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:54,644
- I'll set your man free.
- You're a good man.

160
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,438
On one condition.

161
00:14:57,772 --> 00:14:59,357
(Hands slapping)

162
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,615
Why do we play? I'm better than you.

163
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:09,992
I'll always be better than you.

164
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:12,870
Have I ever missed once?

165
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:15,081
I don't think I have. I can't recall.

166
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,792
You must love humiliation. Or pain.

167
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:22,046
Which do you love most?

168
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,381
(Winces)

169
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:24,882
That one hurt, didn't it?

170
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:28,094
You going to cry?

171
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,929
Give up, little sister.

172
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:32,223
- You're going to miss.
- Oh, I never miss.

173
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:34,600
You will. You're thinking too much.

174
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:38,521
Now you're nervous. "What if she's right?"

175
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:42,984
Luck.

176
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:44,777
Now it's my turn.

177
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:48,197
You're too slow.
You've always been too slow.

178
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,539
(Cell door unlocks)

179
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:06,883
Am I gonna be happy
at the end of this walk?

180
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,885
You'll find out very soon.

181
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:13,681
Say it one more time, handsome.

182
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:15,099
Who am I?

183
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:19,145
The most beautiful woman in the world.

184
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,605
And that's the truth.

185
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:22,857
- Slut.
- (Tyene laughs)

186
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:28,070
Prince doran, ser bronn of the Blackwater.

187
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:30,740
I didn't realize
there were knights of the Blackwater.

188
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:32,283
Only the one.

189
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,827
I believe you've already
met prince trystane.

190
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:37,246
Phnce.

191
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,998
Sorry about the other day.

192
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,501
Jaime: Prince trystane here
is a man of mercy.

193
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:44,086
He's agreed to Grant you your freedom.

194
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,423
I'm glad to hear it.

195
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:50,343
Pie looks good.

196
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,929
There was one condition.

197
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,143
- (Grunts)
- (Bronn groans)

198
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,649
Perhaps some soup instead.

199
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:09,779
- (Merchants shouting)
- Arya: Oysters, clams, and cookies.

200
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:14,700
Oysters, clams, and cookies.

201
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:18,704
Oysters, clams, and cookies.

202
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,831
Oysters, clams, and...

203
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:23,626
How much for your little clam? (Laughs)

204
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,970
Oysters, clams, and cookies.

205
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,850
Oysters, clams, and cookies.

206
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,755
Come on.

207
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,884
Some oysters, girl!

208
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:17,096
I'm talking to you.

209
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:19,015
Is, uh...

210
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,519
- Girl!
- Man: Tie her up!

211
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:26,647
Thin man: Are you deaf? Girl!

212
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:29,692
Girl!

213
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:36,490
My lord.

214
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,204
Sailor: My lord.

215
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:43,789
Tycho: Lord Tyrell.

216
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:45,583
On behalf of the iron bank,

217
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:49,378
may I be the first to welcome you
to the free city of braavos.

218
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:51,213
I hope your journey was trouble-free.

219
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:54,967
A bit of chop the last few days.
Nothing too awful.

220
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:57,803
Good to see the old chap
still guarding the harbor.

221
00:18:57,887 --> 00:19:00,056
And how goes the harvest in the reach?

222
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:05,853
Ah, the vintners say this might be the
best year for red grapes in half a century.

223
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:08,606
If we come to a satisfactory arrangement,

224
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:13,653
I'll be sure to send
a cask of the arbor's finest your way.

225
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:16,280
I'm afraid I don't partake.

226
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:28,125
Some consider usury
distasteful, dishonorable.

227
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:29,835
Pure nonsense, of course.

228
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,004
I'm glad we see eye to eye on this matter.

229
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:37,218
Did you know that at one point maegor III
tried to outlaw it in the seven kingdoms?

230
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,679
Wanted to arrest anyone
caught charging interest

231
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:42,139
and cut off both their hands.

232
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:44,350
Most unfortunate for the glovers.

233
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,435
Mace: If a man charges
no interest on a loan,

234
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:50,147
then he has nothing to gain
and everything to lose, so why chance it?

235
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:54,402
Whereas the promise of reward
makes a man willing to gamble.

236
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:57,905
We are not gamblers
here at the iron bank, lord Tyrell.

237
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:00,366
You are the world's best gamblers.

238
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:04,203
And all those bets you won built this.

239
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:12,378
(Coins clink)

240
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:13,879
(Door opens)

241
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,049
Mace: We should celebrate.

242
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:19,677
Tycho: I'm afraid I still
have a good deal of work to do.

243
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,322
Mace: Nonsense. Work's over. Do you sing?
Tycho: I don't have that gift.

244
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,724
It's not a gift. It's a
skill. Anyone can learn it.

245
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:29,186
(Singing)
So give me a kiss by the long canal

246
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:33,232
and give me two kisses in salty town

247
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:37,278
for we're going to die tomorrow

248
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,657
the bareheaded beggar
the king with his crown...

249
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,861
Meryn: Thought that old shit
would never stop singing.

250
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,078
Wasn't bad, though.

251
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:48,622
The tyrells can all rot in hell.

252
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:50,207
Treasonous cunts.

253
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:53,085
They were going to make
that boy-fucker renly king.

254
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,297
This is the place, lads.

255
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,966
The sleekest little minks in braavos.

256
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:01,594
- You buying?
- Oh, I'm buying.

257
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,637
But I never was good at sharing.

258
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:17,026
- (Chatter)
- (Music playing)

259
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,827
Sell your fish somewhere else.

260
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:29,705
Oh, let her in, brusco. I'm hungry.

261
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:31,665
Come here, sweetness.

262
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,631
They say oysters get the juices flowing.

263
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:41,342
We'll take half a dozen.

264
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,637
Three coppers.

265
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:47,973
Here's a silver because the lady likes you.

266
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:16,085
Too old.

267
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:20,840
Brea.

268
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:37,565
Too old.

269
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:43,112
Madame: I have just the one. Anara.

270
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,574
Our most expensive girl.

271
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:50,786
But well worth it, I assure you.

272
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:57,585
Too old.

273
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:07,386
Do you have what I want or not?

274
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:11,140
Of course. Of course.

275
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:18,606
- (Gas ps)
- These fresh?

276
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:25,321
Come on, the lads are hungry.

277
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:32,119
Nothing better for your cockstand
than fresh oysters.

278
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,415
Guard 1: Here. Thank you.
Guard 2: I'll have one.

279
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,167
Any vinegar?

280
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:41,045
Who let this girl in? Shoo! Shoo!

281
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:42,504
(Guards chuckle)

282
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:03,943
Good.

283
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:15,120
I'll tell you when we're done.

284
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:22,878
You'll have a fresh one for me tomorrow?

285
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:25,172
Of course.

286
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,512
Madame: I'll have you whipped, girl.

287
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:33,847
Go, go on. Out, out, go.

288
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:41,730
(Whispering)

289
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,695
Valar morghulis.

290
00:24:47,778 --> 00:24:49,738
Valar morghulis.

291
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:06,547
And?

292
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:09,299
The thin man wasn't hungry today.

293
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:11,510
Perhaps that is why a man is thin.

294
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:14,722
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow.

295
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:16,098
(Thuds)

296
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,518
A girl has work to do.

297
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:35,117
Your rebellion is over.

298
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:39,163
You can swear your allegiance to me now,

299
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:42,583
or you can die.

300
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,151
(Crying)

301
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:20,079
I believe in second chances.

302
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:24,792
I don't believe in third chances.

303
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:55,197
You write like a seven-year-old.

304
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:58,992
Your maester kindly agreed
to copy it over for me.

305
00:26:59,076 --> 00:27:01,328
- He didn't try to make you pay?
- Mmm-mmm.

306
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:04,540
Maybe he's changed.

307
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:08,127
The queen will be thrilled to know
you're bringing her daughter home.

308
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:09,211
She will.

309
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:13,590
- You love her very much, don't you?
- Of course, she's my niece.

310
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,009
I wasn't talking about her.

311
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:20,180
You think I disapprove?

312
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,810
Because people disapprove
of that sort of thing where you are from?

313
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:27,980
They disapproved of oberyn and me
where you are from.

314
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:31,650
Here, no one blinked an eye.

315
00:27:32,943 --> 00:27:36,905
100 years ago,
no one would have blinked an eye at you

316
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:38,615
if you'd been named Targaryen.

317
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:41,785
It's always changing,

318
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:44,746
who we're supposed to love
and who we're not.

319
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:50,002
The only thing that stays the same
is that we want who we want.

320
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:03,049
I know your daughter had no part
in the terrible thing

321
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:05,142
that happened to the man I love.

322
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,355
Perhaps even you are innocent of that.

323
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:28,790
(Tent flap rustles)

324
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,792
Father.

325
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:35,589
Aren't you cold?

326
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:40,010
No. What are you reading?

327
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:42,554
The dance of dragons.

328
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:43,889
What's it about?

329
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,224
It's the story of the fight

330
00:28:45,307 --> 00:28:47,368
between rhaenyra Targaryen
and her half-brother aegon

331
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,603
for control of the seven kingdoms.

332
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:52,481
Both of them thought
they belonged on the iron throne.

333
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:55,734
When people started declaring
for one of them or the other,

334
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,819
their fight divided the kingdoms in two.

335
00:28:57,903 --> 00:29:01,323
Brothers fought brothers,
dragons fought dragons.

336
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:07,079
By the time it was over,
thousands were dead.

337
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:09,915
And it was a disaster
for the targaryens as well.

338
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:12,709
They never truly recovered.

339
00:29:12,793 --> 00:29:14,836
The dance of dragons.

340
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,757
Why is that a dance?

341
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,676
It's just what they call it.

342
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,344
Hmm. Doesn't make much sense.

343
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,304
I think it's poetic.

344
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,855
If you'd had to choose

345
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:37,067
between rhaenyra and aegon,

346
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,237
who would you have chosen?

347
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:43,282
I wouldn't have chosen either.

348
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:45,951
It's all the choosing sides
that made everything so horrible.

349
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:48,287
Sometimes a person has to choose.

350
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:53,625
Sometimes the world forces his hand.

351
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:58,463
If a man knows what he is

352
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:02,718
and remains true to himself,

353
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:08,432
the choice is no choice at all.

354
00:30:09,016 --> 00:30:11,476
He must fulfill his destiny

355
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:17,149
and become who he is meant to be.

356
00:30:19,568 --> 00:30:21,737
However much he may hate it.

357
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:24,948
It's all right.

358
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:28,827
You don't even know what I'm talking about.

359
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:31,830
It doesn't matter. I want to help you.

360
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:34,458
Is there any way I can help?

361
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:43,800
Yes, there is.

362
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:45,594
Good. I want to.

363
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:50,766
I'm the Princess shireen
of house Baratheon.

364
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,934
And I'm your daughter.

365
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:05,280
(Sighs)

366
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:09,201
Forgive me.

367
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:52,828
Where's my father? I want to see my father.

368
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:55,872
It will all be over soon.

369
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:01,169
(Crying) No.

370
00:32:04,131 --> 00:32:06,091
Where's my father?

371
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:08,635
No, you can't do this.
Father, where are you?

372
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:11,096
Please, let me see my father.

373
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:14,057
Father, where are
you? Don't let her do this.

374
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,394
Please let go!

375
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:21,148
Let me see my father!
Where are you? Please!

376
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:23,665
- Selyse: It's what the lord wants.
- No.

377
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:26,736
- Please! Let go! No!
- It's a good thing.

378
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,822
- A great thing.
- Shireen: Stop!

379
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:30,949
- Please!
- Melisandre: Hear us now, my lord.

380
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:33,761
Shireen: You can't do this! Melisandre:
For you, we offer up this girl...

381
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,204
- Please!
- That you may cleanse her with your fire

382
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:38,248
and that its light may lead our way.

383
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:40,417
Shireen: No, please let me see my father.

384
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,295
If we don't act, we'll
all starve here. All of us.

385
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:46,214
But if we make this sacrifice...

386
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:51,386
Accept this token of our faith, my lord,
and lead us from the darkness.

387
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,638
Lord of light, show us the way.

388
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:55,557
Mother, please!

389
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,103
Mother, please!

390
00:33:00,187 --> 00:33:01,855
- Mother!
- We can't.

391
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:04,333
- There's no other way. She has king's blood.
- Please don't do this!

392
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:06,335
- Please don't!
- Melisandre: Lord of light, protect us.

393
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:10,280
- Father, please!
- For the night is dark and full of terrors.

394
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:13,867
Father, don't do this! Please!

395
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:17,329
Mother, no! Please, help!

396
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:19,748
Don't do this!

397
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:22,542
Please, father! Mother, help!

398
00:33:22,626 --> 00:33:25,712
- No.
- No, please! Don't do this!

399
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:29,174
Don't do this, please, mother!

400
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:33,094
Please, mother! Help!

401
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:35,055
Mother, help!

402
00:33:36,223 --> 00:33:39,809
Please don't do this, mother!

403
00:33:39,893 --> 00:33:42,020
Please, mother!

404
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:44,105
Please! No!

405
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:47,192
Please! No!

406
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:49,778
- (Fire crackling)
- (Shireen screaming)

407
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:00,247
(Screaming stops)

408
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:20,016
(Crowd cheering)

409
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:33,655
(Drums beating)

410
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,751
(Drumming stops)

411
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:59,264
Where have you been?

412
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:01,558
Just making sure everything is in order.

413
00:35:02,142 --> 00:35:04,185
- (Horse neighs)
- (Gate opens)

414
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:06,479
(Cheering)

415
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:21,286
(Cheering stops)

416
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:22,412
(Speaking valyrian)

417
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:25,040
Free citizens of meereen!

418
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:29,336
By the blessings of the graces,

419
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:32,130
and her majesty the queen,

420
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:33,965
welcome

421
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:36,468
to the great games!

422
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:38,470
- (Cheering)
- (Drums beating)

423
00:35:56,029 --> 00:35:58,615
My queen, our first contest.

424
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,534
Who will triumph:

425
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,411
The strong,

426
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:05,288
or the quick?

427
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:11,086
I fight and die for your glory,

428
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,838
oh glorious queen.

429
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:18,718
I fight and die for your glory,

430
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:20,887
oh glorious queen.

431
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:33,274
They're waiting for you.

432
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,778
Clap your hands.

433
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:49,124
(Cheering)

434
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:58,258
(Both grunting)

435
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,300
- (Groans)
- (Daario chuckles)

436
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:07,892
That one, the smaller man.

437
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:09,578
No question,
that's where you should put your money.

438
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:10,895
The smaller man it is.

439
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:12,856
I'm not putting my money anywhere.

440
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:15,066
Kings and queens never bet on the games.

441
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:17,652
Perhaps you should
go find someone who does.

442
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:20,572
People used to bet against me
when I fought in the pits.

443
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:23,408
He would have bet against me.
Common novice mistake.

444
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:25,410
I've spent much of my life in this arena.

445
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:29,956
And in my experience, large men do triumph
over smaller men far more often than not.

446
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:32,876
Has your experience
ever involved any actual fighting?

447
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,586
You yourself?

448
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:37,422
Have you ever tried to kill another man
who was trying to kill you?

449
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:42,594
Whenever I got into the pit
against a beast like that one,

450
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:45,305
the crowd saw me,
all skin and bone back then,

451
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:48,349
then they saw a pile of angry muscles
ready to murder me.

452
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:50,727
They couldn't get
their money out fast enough.

453
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:54,230
But the pile of angry muscles
never had any muscles here

454
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:56,775
or here.

455
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,444
And the big men were always too slow

456
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:02,322
to stop my dagger
from going where their muscles weren't.

457
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:06,159
Yes, whenever I saw a beast like that one
standing across from me

458
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:10,413
making his beast faces,
I knew I could rest easy.

459
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:12,415
- (Shouting)
- (Crowd cheering)

460
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:23,885
You don't approve?

461
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,930
There's always been more than enough death
in the world for my taste.

462
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:29,974
- I can do without it in my leisure time.
- Fair enough.

463
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:31,601
Yet it's an unpleasant question,

464
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:35,814
but what great thing has ever been
accomplished without killing or cruelty?

465
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:39,275
It's easy to confuse
what is with what ought to be,

466
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:42,195
especially when what is
has worked out in your favor.

467
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:43,822
I'm not talking about myself.

468
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:46,241
I'm talking about
the necessary conditions for greatness.

469
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,451
That is greatness?

470
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:52,747
That is a vital part
of the great city of meereen,

471
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:54,749
which existed long before you or I

472
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:59,087
and will remain standing
long after we have returned to the dirt.

473
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,089
My father would have liked you.

474
00:39:01,214 --> 00:39:03,007
- (Gate opens)
- (Crowd cheering)

475
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:09,514
(Speaking valyrian)

476
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:13,017
We ask again: Who will triumph?

477
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:15,520
One day your great city
will return to the dirt as well.

478
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,730
- At your command?
- If need be.

479
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:20,650
A meereenese champion?

480
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:26,531
And how many people will die
to make this happen?

481
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:29,701
If it comes to that,
they will have died for a good reason.

482
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:31,911
Those men think
they're dying for a good reason.

483
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:33,621
Daenerys: Someone else's reason.

484
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:36,332
So your reasons are
true and theirs are false?

485
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:38,293
They don't know their own minds,
but you do?

486
00:39:39,002 --> 00:39:41,963
Well said. You're an eloquent man.

487
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,798
Doesn't mean you're wrong.

488
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:47,302
In my experience, eloquent men are right
every bit as often as imbeciles.

489
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:49,971
Or a westerosi knight?

490
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:51,139
(Jorah speaking valyrian)

491
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:53,474
I fight and die for your glory,

492
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:58,897
oh glorious queen.

493
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:17,790
- Your grace...
- Shut your mouth.

494
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,013
(Crowd cheering)

495
00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:52,533
(Both grunting)

496
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:18,559
(Groans)

497
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:14,949
- (Groans)
- (Cheering)

498
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,272
- You can end this.
- She cannot.

499
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:48,024
You can.

500
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:49,317
(Crowd chanting)

501
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:54,655
(Screams)

502
00:43:02,872 --> 00:43:03,956
(Shouting)

503
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:37,115
(Booing)

504
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,158
(Man shouting)

505
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:43,329
(Crowd groans)

506
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:49,669
(Crowd booing)

507
00:43:58,511 --> 00:43:59,762
(Groaning)

508
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:09,105
(People screaming)

509
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:28,958
Protect your queen!

510
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:31,085
(Crowd screaming)

511
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:07,413
Your grace!

512
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:10,041
Come with me. I know a way out.
I know a way...

513
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:40,154
(Missandei screams)

514
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:47,161
Stay close.

515
00:45:54,627 --> 00:45:56,003
This way.

516
00:46:07,807 --> 00:46:10,184
The other side. Follow me.

517
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,106
Protect your queen!

518
00:46:26,993 --> 00:46:28,160
(Men shouting)

519
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:48,908
- (Drogon roars)
- (Gasps)

520
00:47:51,327 --> 00:47:52,745
(Roaring)

521
00:48:15,184 --> 00:48:16,602
(Men shouting)

522
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,775
(Roars)

523
00:48:35,955 --> 00:48:37,081
(Screaming)

524
00:48:48,676 --> 00:48:50,052
(Screeches)

525
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:57,810
(Screaming)

526
00:49:09,113 --> 00:49:10,823
Drogon!

527
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:46,275
- (Spear pierces)
- (Roaring)

528
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:14,220
