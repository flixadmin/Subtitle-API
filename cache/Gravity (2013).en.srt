And to think he went to Harvard.

150
00:08:21,085 --> 00:08:22,878
You gotta admit one thing:

151
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:25,756
Can't beat the view.

152
00:08:29,802 --> 00:08:32,054
So, what do you like about being up here?

153
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:35,641
STONE:
The silence.

154
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:39,186
I could get used to it.

155
00:09:00,124 --> 00:09:00,999
Terrific.

156
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,461
STONE: Houston, from first inspection,
comms panel appears to be dead.

157
00:09:04,712 --> 00:09:07,172
Am I a go to cut link to auxiliary?

158

CONTROL:
<i>You're the expert, doctor. It's your call.</i>

159
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,594
Houston, I have a bad feeling
about this mission.

160
00:09:12,845 --> 00:09:14,263
CONTROL:
<i>Please elaborate.</i>

161
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:18,142
It's the same feeling I had
about Mardi Gras in 1987.

162
00:09:19,101 --> 00:09:20,227
CONTROL:
<i>That is affirmative.</i>

163
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:23,605
<i>Surprisingly, Control hasn't heard
the Mardi Gras story.</i>

164
00:09:23,856 --> 00:09:25,232
<i>Please proceed.</i>

165
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:28,485
Well, it's day one, and I'm bumping
my way down Bourbon Street...

166
00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:31,113
...looking for a sister
of a friend of mine.

167
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:35,117
Streets are full of people, I'm thinking
there's no way I'm gonna find this girl.

168
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:36,535
STONE:
Proceeding to override.

169
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:40,539
Then all of a sudden, I look up
and there she is. I'm about to yell out.

170
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:43,751
I see she's holding hands
with some hairy guy in board shorts...

171
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:45,544
...and a Margaritaville shirt.

172
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:48,756
And then I realize that
this guy is not a guy.

173
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:50,841
That my girl is holding hands with...

Put a bow on it, Dr. Stone.

188
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,840
I can't. The board is still initializing.

189
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,510
- I'm not gonna ask you again.
- One second.

190

Not one second. Now. Shut it down.

191

That's an order.

192

Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm done.

- Right of disposal.

200
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:02,788
Most likely a spy sat gone bad.
Now it's shrapnel.

00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:21,333
KOWALSKI:
<i>You're breathing too fast.</i>

295
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,627
<i>You're burning oxygen,
and we don't wanna do that.</i>

296
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:25,587
<i>We wanna relax. Copy?</i>

297
00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:27,422
STONE:
Okay, sorry. Yes, copy.

298
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:30,091
- KOWALSKI: <i>All right. Nearly there.</i>
- Copy. Please hurry.

299
00:17:31,343 --> 00:17:33,220
KOWALSKI:
<i>You can holster that torch, Dr. Stone.</i>

300
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,847
Sorry. Sorry.

301
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:41,144
- Aah!
- Gotcha.

302
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:44,522
All right, now I'm gonna tether you to me.

303
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:49,819
I know, you never realized
how devastatingly good-looking I am.

304
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:53,782
But I need you to stop staring
and help me with the tether.

305
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:54,991
Okay?

306
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:56,993
STONE:
Okay. Okay.

307
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:59,246
Uh, I got it.

308
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,915
All right, here we go.

309
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:05,335
Now, to clear you from the jets,
I'm gonna give you a little push.

310
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:07,254
- No, no, no.
- Not a push.

311
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:08,630
A nudge.

312
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,216
No, no, no! Damn it, no!

313
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:21,726
See? Where you go, I go.

314
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:28,566
Better.

315
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:31,152
Let's get out of here.

316
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:36,116
- Goddamn it! Agh.
- I know what you mean.

317
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,867
STONE:
Damn it.

318
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:39,953
KOWALSKI: You're burning oxygen.

319
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:43,873
We're going back to the shuttle.
How's that for a plan? Copy?

320
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:45,083
STONE:
Fuck!

321
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,876
KOWALSKI:
Right. Copy that.

322
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:49,129
Houston, in the blind. This is Kowalski.

323
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:51,756
Dr. Stone and I are gonna
make our way back to base.

324
00:18:52,007 --> 00:18:55,385
Can you get the Explorer to prepare
the airlock for arrival? Copy?

325
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:59,306
Houston, this is Kowalski.
How do you copy?

326
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:02,100
Houston, in the blind. This is Kowalski.

327
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,435
STONE:
They can't hear us.

328
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:05,937
KOWALSKI: We don't know that.
That's why we keep talking.

329
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:09,316
If somebody is listening,
they might just save your life.

330
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:11,609
Set your watch for 90 minutes.

331
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,571
- Why 90?
- KOWALSKI: Well, Houston clocked that debris...

332
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:16,781
...at 50,000 miles an hour.

333
00:19:17,032 --> 00:19:18,742
If you factor in our current orbit...

334
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:22,620
...then I figure we got about 90 minutes
before we get our asses kicked again.

335
00:19:22,871 --> 00:19:24,706
STONE:
O2 down to 6 percent.

336
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:29,169
KOWALSKI: Okay. Pretty scary shit
being untethered up here, isn't it?

337
00:19:30,545 --> 00:19:32,756
Yeah, pretty scary shit.

338
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,008
Well, you did all right.

339
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:40,430
STONE:
Well, you weren't so bad yourself.

340
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:46,436
KOWALSKI:
Houston, in the blind. This is Kowalski.

341
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:49,064
Our current location is approximately...

342
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:52,025
...900 meters out from the Explorer.

343
00:19:52,734 --> 00:19:55,028
Dr. Stone and I would like to
retrieve the body...

344
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:57,030
...of Mission Specialist Shariff...

345
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,157
...and return it to the shuttle.

346
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:01,368
Am I a go to retrieve?

347
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,205
Roger that.

348
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:07,415
STONE:
Where is he? Where is he?

349
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:32,607
Oh, my God.

350
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:36,861
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

351
00:20:41,324 --> 00:20:42,492
KOWALSKI:
Grab him!

352
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:46,996
Grab him! Agh!

353
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:48,415
STONE:
I'm trying, I'm trying!

354
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:54,504
KOWALSKI:
You're pulling me away.

355
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:55,755
STONE:
I got him!

356
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:58,299
- KOWALSKI: Clutch him like he's your valentine.
- I got him.

357
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:01,553
I can't engage my thrust
with you two yo-yoing around.

358
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:33,376
KOWALSKI:
Jesus Christ.

359
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:36,880
<i>Here's hoping you have a hell
of an insurance policy, Houston.</i>

360
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,382
<i>The damages to Explorer...</i>

361
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:41,634
<i>...are catastrophic.</i>

362
00:21:41,885 --> 00:21:43,636
<i>Will commence search for survivors.</i>

363
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:45,930
STONE:
<i>O2 down to 5 percent.</i>

364
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:48,850
KOWALSKI:
All right, here we go. Careful of the edges!

365
00:21:57,484 --> 00:21:59,360
KOWALSKI:
Here. Here!

366
00:22:50,912 --> 00:22:53,039
Houston, in the blind. To confirm:

367
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:57,043
Mission Specialist Dr. Stone and
Mission Commander Matthew Kowalski...

368
00:22:57,293 --> 00:23:01,005
...are the sole survivors of the STS-157.

369
00:23:03,174 --> 00:23:04,551
I apologize for not complying.

370
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:07,595
I should've stopped working
as soon as you instructed me to.

371
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:09,305
We were gonna get hit no matter what.

372
00:23:09,556 --> 00:23:11,724
There was nothing you could do
to change that.

373
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:16,854
Hey.

374
00:23:17,105 --> 00:23:18,356
Yes?

375
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:19,774
All right...

376
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:22,819
...we have to make our way
to the space station.

377
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:25,321
Over there.

378
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:27,949
It's a bit of a hike...

379
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:32,203
...but we need to use their escape pod,
the Soyuz, to get back to Earth.

380
00:23:32,537 --> 00:23:33,705
Agreed?

381
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:36,708
Dr. Stone...

382
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:38,710
...agreed?

383
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:41,170
Agreed.

384
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:43,923
All right. After you.

385
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:47,218
Oh, God.

386
00:23:56,853 --> 00:23:59,564
KOWALSKI:
<i>Houston, in the blind. This is Kowalski.</i>

387
00:23:59,814 --> 00:24:03,234
<i>Dr. Stone and I have determined
to proceed to ISS...</i>

388
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:06,571
<i>...and use one of their Soyuz for reentry.</i>

389
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:09,365
<i>ISS, if you hear us...</i>

390
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:12,368
<i>...we could sure use a rescue mission.</i>

391
00:24:26,257 --> 00:24:28,468
STONE:
<i>O2 down to 2 percent.</i>

392
00:24:28,718 --> 00:24:30,053
KOWALSKI:
<i>We're getting there.</i>

393
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,348
<i>Beautiful, don't you think?</i>

394
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:36,059
STONE:
<i>What?</i>

395
00:24:36,434 --> 00:24:37,852
KOWALSKI:
<i>The sunrise.</i>

396
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,439
That's what I'm gonna miss the most.

397
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:49,238
So where's home, Dr. Stone?

398
00:24:52,158 --> 00:24:54,369
Ryan, where's home?

399
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:57,747
- Home?
- Mm-hm.

400
00:24:58,289 --> 00:25:01,084
Down there. Mother Earth.

401
00:25:01,876 --> 00:25:03,294
Where do you pitch your tent?

402
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:08,841
Lake Zurich.

403
00:25:09,092 --> 00:25:10,677
Where the hell is that?

404
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:14,889
Illinois.

405
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:18,142
Illinois. Central time zone.

406
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:21,229
That would make it roughly...

407
00:25:21,813 --> 00:25:23,272
...8 p.m.

408
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:26,901
What are the good people of Lake Zurich
doing at 8:00?

409
00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:29,696
I don't know.

410
00:25:30,071 --> 00:25:32,615
I'm not gonna make it.
I'm slowing you down.

411
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:34,409
What would you be doing?

412
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:38,746
Come on, Ryan.

413
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:40,998
It's 8:00.

414
00:25:41,332 --> 00:25:44,669
You've just left the hospital
after an 18-hour shift.

415
00:25:45,378 --> 00:25:46,546
Driving home.

416
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:51,634
The radio.

417
00:25:53,511 --> 00:25:55,471
I listen to the radio.

418
00:25:56,139 --> 00:25:58,266
There we go. Let me guess.

419
00:25:58,516 --> 00:25:59,809
NPR?

420
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,394
Classical?

421
00:26:01,644 --> 00:26:03,187
Top 40?

422
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:10,153
Anything. I don't care,
as long as they don't talk. I just drive.

423
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:14,574
And where are you driving to?

424
00:26:16,993 --> 00:26:18,494
I just drive.

425
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:21,330
What do you miss down there?

426
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:24,792
Is there a Mr. Stone?

427
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,211
No.

428
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,297
Nobody special?

429
00:26:32,383 --> 00:26:34,635
Somebody down there looking up...

430
00:26:34,886 --> 00:26:36,554
...thinking about you?

431
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:39,974
Ryan?

432
00:26:47,064 --> 00:26:48,691
I had a daughter.

433
00:26:59,452 --> 00:27:01,120
She was 4.

434
00:27:03,706 --> 00:27:05,124
She was at school playing tag.

435
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:08,419
Slipped, hit her head, and that was it.

436
00:27:10,922 --> 00:27:12,632
Stupidest thing.

437
00:27:18,846 --> 00:27:21,557
I was driving when I got the call, so...

438
00:27:22,767 --> 00:27:25,269
Ever since then, that's what I do.

439
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,730
I wake up...

440
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:30,525
...I go to work...

441
00:27:30,817 --> 00:27:32,610
...and I just drive.

442
00:27:59,637 --> 00:28:01,973
O2 down to 1 percent.

443
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,237
KOWALSKI:
Well, I've got good news and bad news.

444
00:28:16,487 --> 00:28:18,990
The good news is, we're about 5 minutes
from the ISS...

445
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,576
...and I know where the Russians
stash their vodka.

446
00:28:21,826 --> 00:28:25,037
And that is good,
because I'm running on fumes here.

447
00:28:25,288 --> 00:28:26,163
The bad news is...

448
00:28:26,414 --> 00:28:29,375
...I'm gonna be about 10 minutes short
of breaking Anatoly's record, and...

449
00:28:31,002 --> 00:28:32,503
- STONE: Agh!
- What?

450
00:28:33,004 --> 00:28:35,256
I'm redlining. My O2 tank pressure is low.

451
00:28:35,506 --> 00:28:38,384
Your tank is out of oxygen,
but you still have it in your suit.

452
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:39,302
Got it.

453
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:41,053
KOWALSKI:
So you have to sip, not gulp.

454
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:43,973
Wine, not beer.

455
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:45,766
Sip, Ryan.

456
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:49,395
Houston, in the blind,
we have a visual of the ISS.

457
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:52,565
The station must have been evacuated
because the first Soyuz...

458
00:28:52,815 --> 00:28:55,735
...is missing. The second Soyuz
exhibits surface damage...

459
00:28:55,985 --> 00:28:57,778
...and its chute has been deployed.

460
00:28:58,029 --> 00:29:01,616
Any use as an escape pod for reentry
is impossible.

461
00:29:01,866 --> 00:29:04,201
STONE: Shouldn't we be turning?
We're drifting again.

462
00:29:04,452 --> 00:29:06,996
KOWALSKI: Not yet.
I wasn't kidding about those fumes.

463
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:09,665
This can has one or two
good thrusts left...

464
00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:11,250
...if we're lucky.

465
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:25,139
Steady.

466
00:29:34,857 --> 00:29:36,108
Aim.

467
00:29:36,984 --> 00:29:38,235
Fire.

468
00:29:44,033 --> 00:29:47,078
- Brake! Brake. You have to brake!
- I can't, the can's...

469
00:29:47,328 --> 00:29:50,122
...empty. We're gonna hit hard.
Grab ahold of anything you can!

470
00:30:02,093 --> 00:30:03,511
STONE:
What do I do?

471
00:30:04,595 --> 00:30:06,097
What do I do?

472
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:15,898
Ryan!

473
00:30:21,362 --> 00:30:24,782
STONE: The tether broke, I'm detached!
I'm detached!

474
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:26,283
KOWALSKI:
Grab ahold!

475
00:30:28,786 --> 00:30:29,620
Grab anything!

476
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:47,304
KOWALSKI:
Ryan!

477
00:30:49,265 --> 00:30:51,559
- Give me five.
- I've got you.

478
00:30:51,976 --> 00:30:53,894
I've got you. Right here.

479
00:30:57,398 --> 00:30:58,441
Shit!

480
00:30:58,691 --> 00:31:01,027
STONE:
No, no, no!

481
00:31:02,486 --> 00:31:03,487
Got you.

482
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:14,081
Got you.

483
00:31:17,334 --> 00:31:19,879
You just hold on,
and I'm gonna start pulling you in.

484
00:31:20,129 --> 00:31:20,796
Hey, doc.

485
00:31:21,047 --> 00:31:22,631
Just hold on. Hang on.

486
00:31:22,882 --> 00:31:25,092
- I am gonna pull you in.
- Ryan, listen.

487
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:26,427
You have to let me go.

488
00:31:26,677 --> 00:31:28,012
- No.
- The ropes are too loose.

489
00:31:28,262 --> 00:31:29,263
I'm pulling you with me.

490
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:32,266
- Let me go or we both die.
- I'm not letting you go!

491
00:31:32,516 --> 00:31:33,809
We're fine! Unh.

492
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,144
- Agh!
- No.

493
00:31:40,566 --> 00:31:41,650
KOWALSKI:
Ryan, let go.

494
00:31:41,901 --> 00:31:43,652
STONE:
No. No.

495
00:31:44,028 --> 00:31:46,072
You're not going anywhere.
You're not going anywhere.

496
00:31:46,697 --> 00:31:48,866
- It's not up to you.
- No, no, no.

497
00:31:49,116 --> 00:31:51,118
Please don't do this.

498
00:31:51,368 --> 00:31:53,454
Please, please, please.
Please don't do this.

499
00:31:53,704 --> 00:31:56,457
Please don't do this. No, no, no.
Please don't, Matt.

500
00:31:56,707 --> 00:31:58,334
Please don't do this.

501
00:32:00,961 --> 00:32:02,713
You're gonna make it, Ryan.

502
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:05,299
No!

503
00:32:26,403 --> 00:32:29,990
I had you. I had you. I had you.

504
00:32:45,673 --> 00:32:47,341
KOWALSKI:
<i>Ryan, do you hear me?</i>

505
00:32:50,136 --> 00:32:51,554
<i>Do you copy?</i>

506
00:32:52,138 --> 00:32:55,391
My CO2 alarm went off.
My CO2 alarm went off.

507
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:57,685
KOWALSKI:
<i>Look, you need to board the station.</i>

508
00:32:58,227 --> 00:32:59,854
<i>Do you see the airlock?</i>

509
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,614
<i>Hey, Ryan.</i>

510
00:33:11,532 --> 00:33:12,908
<i>You copy?</i>

511
00:33:14,535 --> 00:33:16,245
<i>Look for the airlock.</i>

512
00:33:19,123 --> 00:33:21,834
<i>It's above you, next to the Zarya module.</i>

513
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:26,630
<i>You see it?</i>

514
00:33:26,881 --> 00:33:30,176
STONE:
Yes. Yes, I see it. I see it.

515
00:33:30,426 --> 00:33:33,220
KOWALSKI:
<i>All right, good. That's where you wanna go.</i>

516
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,806
<i>Now you're getting light-headed, right?</i>

517
00:33:36,056 --> 00:33:37,683
Yeah. Yes.

518
00:33:38,434 --> 00:33:40,269
KOWALSKI:
<i>That's because you're breathing CO2.</i>

519
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:42,271
<i>You're losing consciousness.</i>

520
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:44,064
<i>You need to board the station.</i>

521
00:33:44,315 --> 00:33:45,399
Okay.

522
00:33:45,983 --> 00:33:48,903
KOWALSKI: <i>That second Soyuz
is too damaged for reentry...</i>

523
00:33:49,153 --> 00:33:51,947
<i>...but it's perfectly fine
for a little Sunday drive.</i>

524
00:33:52,198 --> 00:33:53,574
Sunday drive?

525
00:33:54,074 --> 00:33:55,576
KOWALSKI:
<i>Look to the west.</i>

526
00:33:57,036 --> 00:33:59,121
<i>You see that dot in the distance?</i>

527
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:00,789
<i>That's a Chinese station.</i>

528
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:01,790
STONE:
Yes.

529
00:34:02,041 --> 00:34:05,085
KOWALSKI: <i>You're gonna take the Soyuz,
and you're gonna cruise over there.</i>

530
00:34:06,212 --> 00:34:08,881
<i>Chinese lifeboat is a Shenzhou.</i>

531
00:34:09,423 --> 00:34:10,841
I've never flown a Shenzhou.

532
00:34:11,091 --> 00:34:12,134
KOWALSKI:
<i>It doesn't matter.</i>

533
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:15,679
<i>Its reentry protocol is
identical to the Soyuz.</i>

534
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:17,932
Okay.

535
00:34:19,767 --> 00:34:22,102
KOWALSKI:
<i>You never flown the Soyuz either?</i>

536
00:34:22,436 --> 00:34:24,063
Only a simulator.

537
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:26,190
KOWALSKI:
<i>Well, then you know.</i>

538
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:30,069
But I crashed it.

539
00:34:30,319 --> 00:34:33,197
KOWALSKI:
<i>It's a simulator, that's what it's designed for.</i>

540
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:37,243
Every time.

541
00:34:37,618 --> 00:34:39,411
I crashed it every time.

542
00:34:39,662 --> 00:34:42,915
KOWALSKI: <i>You point the damn thing
at Earth. It's not rocket science.</i>

543
00:34:43,791 --> 00:34:47,795
<i>And by this time tomorrow, you're gonna be back
in Lake Zurich with a hell of a story to tell.</i>

544
00:34:48,796 --> 00:34:50,130
<i>You copy?</i>

545
00:34:51,757 --> 00:34:53,300
<i>Ryan, you copy?</i>

546
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:56,262
- I'm gonna take the Soyuz and come get you.
- KOWALSKI: <i>No, you're not.</i>

547
00:34:56,512 --> 00:34:59,181
- I'm coming to get you.
- KOWALSKI: <i>I've got too much of a head start.</i>

548
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:02,851
- I'm coming to get you.
- KOWALSKI: <i>I'm afraid that ship already sailed.</i>

549
00:35:03,686 --> 00:35:06,063
<i>Ryan, you're gonna have to learn to let go.</i>

550
00:35:06,939 --> 00:35:08,565
- But I...
- KOWALSKI: <i>I wanna hear you say...</i>

551
00:35:08,816 --> 00:35:09,817
<i>...you're gonna make it.</i>

552
00:35:11,819 --> 00:35:13,529
<i>Come on, Ryan, say it.</i>

553
00:35:15,406 --> 00:35:16,824
I'm gonna make it.

554
00:35:17,074 --> 00:35:18,951
KOWALSKI:
<i>All right. Keep going.</i>

555
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,205
<i>What kind of a name is Ryan for a girl?</i>

556
00:35:24,748 --> 00:35:26,375
Dad wanted a boy.

557
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:28,919
KOWALSKI:
<i>Are you close to the airlock?</i>

558
00:35:29,712 --> 00:35:30,921
Not yet.

559
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:32,506
KOWALSKI:
<i>Keep going.</i>

560
00:35:32,965 --> 00:35:35,718
<i>So now that we have some distance
between us...</i>

561
00:35:35,968 --> 00:35:37,678
<i>...you're attracted to me, right?</i>

562
00:35:37,928 --> 00:35:38,637
What?

563
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:42,433
KOWALSKI:
<i>Well, people say I have beautiful blue eyes.</i>

564
00:35:46,729 --> 00:35:48,147
You have beautiful...

565
00:35:48,814 --> 00:35:50,524
You have beautiful blue eyes.

566
00:35:50,774 --> 00:35:52,234
KOWALSKI:
<i>I have brown eyes.</i>

567
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:57,531
<i>Hey, you wanna know the good news?</i>

568
00:35:57,781 --> 00:35:58,490
What?

569
00:35:58,741 --> 00:36:00,492
KOWALSKI:
<i>I'm gonna break Anatoly's record...</i>

570
00:36:00,743 --> 00:36:02,911
<i>...and I think mine's
gonna stand for a long, long time.</i>

571
00:36:03,162 --> 00:36:05,956
Oh, no. I'm coming to get you.

572
00:36:08,959 --> 00:36:10,294
KOWALSKI:
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

573
00:36:10,544 --> 00:36:12,129
What? What?

574
00:36:12,379 --> 00:36:13,797
KOWALSKI:
<i>Wow.</i>

575
00:36:15,049 --> 00:36:16,425
<i>Hey, Ryan?</i>

576
00:36:16,759 --> 00:36:17,926
Yeah?

577
00:36:18,177 --> 00:36:20,095
KOWALSKI:
<i>You should see the sun on the Ganges.</i>

578
00:36:23,015 --> 00:36:24,516
<i>It's amazing.</i>

579
00:40:50,532 --> 00:40:53,452
Where are you? Where are you?
Comms. Comms.

580
00:40:53,702 --> 00:40:55,412
There you are. Okay.

581
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:08,175
Matt, this is Ryan, copy.

582
00:41:11,136 --> 00:41:13,722
Matt, this is Ryan, copy.

583
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:20,646
Matt, I made it, I'm here,
I'm on the station. Do you copy?

584
00:41:26,652 --> 00:41:28,570
Come on, Matt, talk to me.

585
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:31,490
Tell me where you are,
give me your position.

586
00:41:32,658 --> 00:41:36,078
Where are you? Give me a visual.
Just tell me what you see.

587
00:41:40,666 --> 00:41:43,752
Oh, come on. You've been yammering
since we left Cape Canaveral.

588
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:45,921
Now you decide to shut up? Talk to me.

589
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:49,132
Just say something, say anything.
I don't care.

590
00:41:54,971 --> 00:41:56,682
Hey.

591
00:41:57,724 --> 00:42:00,852
Tell me about, uh, Mardi Gras.
Tell me about the hairy guy.

592
00:42:01,103 --> 00:42:02,938
Huh? Tell me what happened.

593
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:05,565
What happened to the, uh, hairy guy?

594
00:42:11,697 --> 00:42:13,365
Please talk to me.

595
00:42:17,911 --> 00:42:19,246
Please.

596
00:42:35,053 --> 00:42:36,722
Houston, in the blind...

597
00:42:39,099 --> 00:42:43,103
...this is Mission Specialist Ryan Stone
reporting from the ISS.

598
00:42:45,021 --> 00:42:47,858
All communications with
Mission Commander Matthew Kowalski...

599
00:42:48,108 --> 00:42:49,568
...have been lost.

600
00:42:52,779 --> 00:42:54,948
Radio transmission absent.

601
00:42:57,075 --> 00:42:58,910
Visuals nonexistent.

602
00:43:01,413 --> 00:43:02,998
To confirm...

603
00:43:03,749 --> 00:43:06,752
...I, Ryan Stone, am the sole survivor...

604
00:43:07,127 --> 00:43:09,546
...of STS-157.

605
00:43:22,976 --> 00:43:24,186
What now?

606
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:53,840
Agh.

607
00:45:00,866 --> 00:45:01,950
Okay.

608
00:45:04,953 --> 00:45:07,038
Okay. Where is it, where is it?

609
00:45:07,289 --> 00:45:09,332
Where is the power? Here you are.

610
00:45:12,127 --> 00:45:13,962
Okay, great, just like training.

611
00:45:14,838 --> 00:45:16,840
Undocking, undocking.

612
00:45:17,090 --> 00:45:18,425
Undocking.

613
00:45:19,593 --> 00:45:20,635
Red.

614
00:45:25,765 --> 00:45:27,100
Okay.

615
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:30,979
Okay, where is it?

616
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:31,938
Where is it?

617
00:45:33,106 --> 00:45:34,274
Come on.

618
00:45:35,108 --> 00:45:36,359
Okay.

619
00:45:39,738 --> 00:45:42,365
Okay. Okay, I remember this.
I remember this.

620
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:59,341
Oh, you don't have four minutes.
We're going manual.

621
00:46:00,842 --> 00:46:02,177
Come on.

622
00:46:02,552 --> 00:46:03,762
Okay.

623
00:46:04,262 --> 00:46:07,432
Okay. Activate... Activate undock.

624
00:46:35,585 --> 00:46:37,545
Seven minutes to get out of here.

625
00:46:44,386 --> 00:46:46,471
All right, okay.

626
00:47:02,112 --> 00:47:03,113
What? What, what?

627
00:47:13,415 --> 00:47:14,833
No, no, no!

628
00:47:34,769 --> 00:47:36,396
Unh! Agh.

629
00:47:44,863 --> 00:47:46,281
Stop, stop, stop!

630
00:48:03,256 --> 00:48:05,341
That's right, that's right.
Come on, come on.

631
00:48:05,592 --> 00:48:08,470
That's right, that's right, that's right.

632
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,013
Ahh.

633
00:48:10,889 --> 00:48:11,473
Come on.

634
00:48:47,967 --> 00:48:48,885
Great.

635
00:49:35,181 --> 00:49:38,935
Clear skies with a chance of satellite debris.

636
00:50:51,758 --> 00:50:55,720
Okay, we detach this and we go home.
Piece of cake.

637
00:51:21,496 --> 00:51:22,705
Okay.

638
00:51:26,793 --> 00:51:28,711
Okay, what do we have?

639
00:51:29,087 --> 00:51:30,880
Okay, all right.

640
00:51:41,516 --> 00:51:42,684
Shit.

641
00:51:50,858 --> 00:51:52,235
Okay, come on.

642
00:51:52,485 --> 00:51:53,820
Come on, come on.

643
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:55,154
All right.

644
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,872
I hate space.

645
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:49,102
Shut up.

646
00:53:53,773 --> 00:53:54,941
Okay.

647
00:54:02,907 --> 00:54:04,367
All right.

648
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:10,081
That's good.

649
00:54:11,582 --> 00:54:12,834
Okay.

650
00:54:14,252 --> 00:54:16,337
Let's stabilize you.

651
00:54:31,477 --> 00:54:32,728
Okay.

652
00:54:34,063 --> 00:54:36,816
Let's go visit the Chinese station.

653
00:54:37,859 --> 00:54:39,235
Houston, in the blind...

654
00:54:39,485 --> 00:54:43,114
...Tiangong is approximately
100 kilometers...

655
00:54:43,364 --> 00:54:45,283
...to the west...

656
00:54:45,533 --> 00:54:48,828
...and I am off its course by about...

657
00:54:49,078 --> 00:54:50,621
...13 degrees.

658
00:54:50,872 --> 00:54:53,166
I will correct trajectory.

659
00:55:15,021 --> 00:55:16,189
Okay.

660
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:18,274
Okay.

661
00:55:19,066 --> 00:55:20,151
Okay.

662
00:55:21,944 --> 00:55:23,154
I will engage S-Ka-Dae...

663
00:55:23,404 --> 00:55:26,282
...in five, four, three...

664
00:55:26,532 --> 00:55:27,783
...two, one.

665
00:55:42,715 --> 00:55:45,259
What's happening, what's happening?
Come on, come on.

666
00:55:48,012 --> 00:55:48,679
One.

667
00:56:03,277 --> 00:56:04,570
Come on, come on, come on.

668
00:56:09,742 --> 00:56:11,536
You gotta be kidding me.

669
00:56:11,911 --> 00:56:13,746
You gotta be kidding me!

670
00:56:18,584 --> 00:56:19,835
No! Don't you fu...

671
00:56:30,137 --> 00:56:31,973
<i>Houston, in the blind.</i>

672
00:56:32,223 --> 00:56:35,059
<i>Houston, in the blind,
this is Dr. Ryan Stone.</i>

673
00:56:35,309 --> 00:56:39,313
<i>I'm calling from the Soyuz TMA-14M.</i>

674
00:56:39,689 --> 00:56:43,067
<i>I'm currently out of fuel and adrift,
do you copy?</i>

675
00:56:45,403 --> 00:56:49,407
<i>Houston. This is Dr. Ryan Stone.</i>

676
00:56:49,699 --> 00:56:51,492
<i>Do you copy?</i>

677
00:56:55,413 --> 00:56:59,041
<i>Houston. This is Ryan Stone.</i>

678
00:56:59,292 --> 00:57:00,501
<i>Do you copy?</i>

679
00:57:03,629 --> 00:57:06,716
Houston, this is Mission...
Mission Specialist Ryan Stone.

680
00:57:06,966 --> 00:57:07,967
Do you copy?

681
00:57:10,303 --> 00:57:13,306
STONE:
Houston. Houston, please confirm identity.

682
00:57:13,556 --> 00:57:16,225
Houston, you're coming in
over an AM frequency. Copy.

683
00:57:18,436 --> 00:57:19,895
Do you copy?

684
00:57:20,271 --> 00:57:23,566
Is this the Chinese station?
Is this Tiangong? Copy.

685
00:57:25,318 --> 00:57:27,069
STONE:
Mayday, can you copy?

686
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:29,655
Mayday, mayday. Mayday.

687
00:57:30,197 --> 00:57:33,200
- MAN: <i>Mayday.</i>
- Yes, yes. Mayday, mayday.

688
00:57:33,451 --> 00:57:35,995
- MAN: <i>Mayday.</i>
- Mayday, mayday.

689
00:57:36,746 --> 00:57:39,081
MAN:
<i>Aningaaq.</i>

690
00:57:41,292 --> 00:57:44,295
- Aningaaq, is that your name?
- MAN: <i>Aningaaq.</i>

691
00:57:44,545 --> 00:57:47,882
- Aningaaq is your name? Is that your name?
- MAN: <i>Mayday. Aningaaq.</i>

692
00:57:48,132 --> 00:57:50,384
<i>Aningaaq. Mayday.</i>

693
00:57:50,635 --> 00:57:52,637
No, no, no. No, my name is not mayday.

694
00:57:52,887 --> 00:57:55,139
I'm Stone. Dr. Ryan Stone.

695
00:57:55,389 --> 00:57:56,891
I need help. I am...

696
00:58:00,978 --> 00:58:02,521
Those are dogs.

697
00:58:03,731 --> 00:58:05,107
They're calling from Earth.

698
00:58:08,653 --> 00:58:11,489
- They're calling from Earth.
- MAN: <i>Ha-ha-ha!</i>

699
00:58:23,376 --> 00:58:24,794
Aningaaq...

700
00:58:25,795 --> 00:58:28,506
...make your dogs bark again for me,
would you, please?

701
00:58:30,383 --> 00:58:33,094
Your dogs. Dogs, you know.

702
00:58:33,344 --> 00:58:35,596
- MAN: <i>Ha-ha-ha!</i>
- Woof, woof. Dogs.

703
00:58:49,652 --> 00:58:50,945
Woof, woof.

704
00:59:19,181 --> 00:59:21,809
Oh, I'm gonna die, Aningaaq.

705
00:59:24,145 --> 00:59:27,356
I know, we're all gonna die.
Everybody knows that.

706
00:59:28,023 --> 00:59:30,359
But I'm gonna die today.

707
00:59:32,862 --> 00:59:34,071
Funny, that.

708
00:59:34,321 --> 00:59:36,282
You know, to know...

709
00:59:39,285 --> 00:59:42,371
But the thing is, it's that I'm still scared.

710
00:59:42,830 --> 00:59:44,790
I'm really scared.

711
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:51,088
Nobody will mourn for me,
no one will pray for my soul.

712
00:59:54,216 --> 00:59:56,010
Will you mourn for me?

713
00:59:57,511 --> 00:59:59,513
Will you say a prayer for me?

714
01:00:00,097 --> 01:00:01,849
Or is it too late?

715
01:00:06,395 --> 01:00:10,024
I mean, I'd say one for myself,
but I've never prayed in my life, so...

716
01:00:11,567 --> 01:00:13,444
Nobody ever taught me how.

717
01:00:17,698 --> 01:00:19,784
Nobody ever taught me how.

718
01:00:31,128 --> 01:00:32,546
A baby.

719
01:00:45,351 --> 01:00:47,812
There's a baby with you, huh?

720
01:00:50,105 --> 01:00:52,358
Is that a lullaby you're singing?

721
01:00:55,361 --> 01:00:56,821
That's so sweet.

722
01:00:59,323 --> 01:01:01,659
I used to sing to my baby.

723
01:01:05,371 --> 01:01:07,498
I hope I see her soon.

724
01:02:17,651 --> 01:02:21,155
That's nice, Aningaaq.
Keep singing, just like that.

725
01:02:22,823 --> 01:02:25,326
Sing me to sleep, and I'll sleep.

726
01:02:27,036 --> 01:02:30,748
Keep singing. And sing and sing.

727
01:03:00,945 --> 01:03:02,571
No, no, no, don't!

728
01:03:45,656 --> 01:03:48,242
Check your watch.
Thirteen hours and 11 minutes.

729
01:03:48,492 --> 01:03:51,120
Call Anatoly and tell him he's been bumped.

730
01:03:51,370 --> 01:03:53,706
- It's a little gloomy in here, isn't it?
- How did you...?

731
01:03:53,956 --> 01:03:56,750
- Trust me, it's a hell of a story.
- But how did you...?

732
01:03:59,253 --> 01:04:00,546
That's better.

733
01:04:01,422 --> 01:04:04,925
I found a little extra...
A little extra battery power.

734
01:04:05,175 --> 01:04:07,678
It helps that I didn't have you around
to distract me.

735
01:04:07,928 --> 01:04:10,180
I have to say, I'm glad to see you.

736
01:04:10,431 --> 01:04:12,266
I didn't think you were gonna make it.

737
01:04:12,516 --> 01:04:13,934
Did you find the vodka?

738
01:04:15,436 --> 01:04:18,647
- You never told me where it was, so...
- Oh, well...

739
01:04:18,897 --> 01:04:20,441
Ah, ah!

740
01:04:24,236 --> 01:04:25,779
To Anatoly.

741
01:04:32,536 --> 01:04:35,289
Huh? No? All right.

742
01:04:36,331 --> 01:04:37,791
Let's get out of here.

743
01:04:39,585 --> 01:04:41,503
The Chinese station's about 100 miles.

744
01:04:41,754 --> 01:04:44,214
Just a little Sunday drive.

745
01:04:44,465 --> 01:04:45,924
- We can't.
- Sure we can.

746
01:04:46,175 --> 01:04:49,887
- There's no fuel, I tried everything.
- Well, there's always something we can do.

747
01:04:50,137 --> 01:04:51,263
I tried everything.

748
01:04:51,513 --> 01:04:53,140
Did you try the soft landing jets?

749
01:04:53,390 --> 01:04:54,641
They're for landing, so...

750
01:04:54,892 --> 01:04:57,728
Landing is launching. It's the same.
Didn't you learn that in training?

751
01:04:57,978 --> 01:05:01,273
- I never got to land the simulator, I told you.
- But you know about it.

752
01:05:01,523 --> 01:05:04,985
- And I crashed it every time.
- Do you wanna go back or stay here?

753
01:05:08,197 --> 01:05:10,324
I get it, it's nice up here.

754
01:05:13,368 --> 01:05:17,331
You can just shut down all the systems...

755
01:05:18,332 --> 01:05:20,125
...turn out all the lights...

756
01:05:21,001 --> 01:05:24,046
...and just close your eyes
and tune out everybody.

757
01:05:24,463 --> 01:05:26,423
There's nobody up here that can hurt you.

758
01:05:27,174 --> 01:05:28,509
It's safe.

759
01:05:31,804 --> 01:05:34,848
I mean, what's the point of going on?
What's the point of living?

760
01:05:39,394 --> 01:05:43,107
Your kid died.
Doesn't get any rougher than that.

761
01:05:45,651 --> 01:05:48,153
But still, it's a matter of what you do now.

762
01:05:49,655 --> 01:05:53,200
If you decide to go,
then you gotta just get on with it.

763
01:05:53,826 --> 01:05:56,286
Sit back, enjoy the ride.

764
01:05:56,870 --> 01:06:00,290
You gotta plant both your feet
on the ground and start living life.

765
01:06:00,541 --> 01:06:02,000
How did you get here?

766
01:06:02,251 --> 01:06:04,461
I'm telling you, it's a hell of a story.

767
01:06:04,878 --> 01:06:06,213
Hey, Ryan?

768
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:07,589
What?

769
01:06:08,006 --> 01:06:09,675
It's time to go home.

770
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:54,678
Landing...

771
01:06:57,055 --> 01:07:00,100
Landing... Landing is launching.

772
01:07:01,643 --> 01:07:02,936
I said...

773
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:18,327
Okay, landing, landing.

774
01:07:18,577 --> 01:07:20,370
Landing is green.

775
01:07:21,038 --> 01:07:22,289
Agh.

776
01:07:31,006 --> 01:07:32,132
Okay.

777
01:07:33,884 --> 01:07:36,720
Okay, landing. All right.

778
01:07:37,763 --> 01:07:40,349
Okay. Soft landing jets
trigger automatically...

779
01:07:40,599 --> 01:07:42,809
...at 3 meters before landing, so...

780
01:07:45,687 --> 01:07:47,940
Oh, you're a clever son of a bitch, Matt.

781
01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:51,818
I need to... I need to get rid of the Bay-O...

782
01:07:52,069 --> 01:07:54,363
...and the engine module.

783
01:07:55,614 --> 01:07:56,615
Right. Okay.

784
01:07:57,699 --> 01:07:58,283
Okay.

785
01:08:00,869 --> 01:08:01,995
Okay.

786
01:08:04,873 --> 01:08:06,500
Tri-module separation.

787
01:08:07,668 --> 01:08:08,252
Go.

788
01:08:23,350 --> 01:08:24,768
Okay.

789
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:27,896
Houston, here's the tricky part.

790
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:30,232
Soyuz has to think...

791
01:08:30,482 --> 01:08:33,819
...we are 3 meters off the Earth.

792
01:08:35,237 --> 01:08:37,698
All right. Okay.

793
01:08:37,990 --> 01:08:39,199
Hey, Matt?

794
01:08:39,825 --> 01:08:41,743
Since I had to listen to endless hours...

795
01:08:41,994 --> 01:08:44,955
...of your storytelling this week,
I need you to do me a favor.

796
01:08:46,915 --> 01:08:49,918
You are gonna see
a little girl with brown hair...

797
01:08:50,168 --> 01:08:52,838
...very messy, lots of knots.

798
01:08:53,088 --> 01:08:54,881
She doesn't like to brush it.

799
01:08:55,299 --> 01:08:56,758
That's okay.

800
01:08:57,384 --> 01:08:59,094
Her name is Sarah.

801
01:08:59,845 --> 01:09:02,222
Can you please tell her...

802
01:09:02,472 --> 01:09:04,975
...that Mama found her red shoe?

803
01:09:05,642 --> 01:09:08,270
She was so worried about that shoe, Matt.

804
01:09:08,729 --> 01:09:10,397
But it was just right under the bed.

805
01:09:14,943 --> 01:09:15,527
Give her...

806
01:09:15,777 --> 01:09:19,281
...a big hug and a big kiss for me
and tell her that Mama misses her.

807
01:09:19,823 --> 01:09:22,409
You tell her that she is my angel.

808
01:09:22,909 --> 01:09:26,121
And she makes me so proud. So, so proud.

809
01:09:31,835 --> 01:09:33,670
And you tell her that I'm not quitting.

810
01:09:40,761 --> 01:09:42,971
You tell her that I love her, Matt.

811
01:09:43,889 --> 01:09:46,391
You tell her that I love her so much.

812
01:09:48,769 --> 01:09:50,479
Can you do that for me?

813
01:09:53,231 --> 01:09:54,733
Roger that.

814
01:09:56,860 --> 01:09:58,320
Here we go.

815
01:10:35,065 --> 01:10:37,526
You're losing altitude, Tiangong.

816
01:10:40,529 --> 01:10:43,615
You keep dropping
and you're gonna kiss the atmosphere.

817
01:10:44,366 --> 01:10:47,077
But not without me
because you're my last ride.

818
01:10:50,956 --> 01:10:52,249
Wait.

819
01:10:59,548 --> 01:11:00,841
Five.

820
01:11:02,050 --> 01:11:03,260
Four.

821
01:11:04,386 --> 01:11:05,679
Three...

822
01:11:06,596 --> 01:11:08,432
No more just driving.

823
01:11:09,975 --> 01:11:11,476
Let's go home.

824
01:11:16,815 --> 01:11:19,359
Okay, come on.
Come on. Come on.

825
01:11:20,402 --> 01:11:21,778
Steady, steady.

826
01:11:22,404 --> 01:11:24,781
Come on. Come on. Agh!

827
01:11:28,702 --> 01:11:31,746
Where are you? Where are you?
Forty-five, 90, 180.

828
01:11:31,997 --> 01:11:33,123
One-eighty.

829
01:11:33,582 --> 01:11:34,666
Agh!

830
01:11:40,672 --> 01:11:41,798
Come on.

831
01:11:51,516 --> 01:11:52,684
Okay.

832
01:12:10,035 --> 01:12:11,953
Damn it. Agh!

833
01:12:51,868 --> 01:12:52,994
Agh!

834
01:13:39,624 --> 01:13:41,084
Shit!

835
01:13:50,468 --> 01:13:52,387
Shenzhou, come on.

836
01:13:52,679 --> 01:13:54,306
Shenzhou. Shenzhou.

837
01:13:54,848 --> 01:13:55,807
Fuck!

838
01:13:56,057 --> 01:13:57,058
Okay, this way.

839
01:14:57,702 --> 01:14:59,913
In the Soyuz, the power button is...

840
01:15:00,538 --> 01:15:01,414
...here.

841
01:15:04,167 --> 01:15:07,087
Okay, uh, undocking, undocking. Um...

842
01:15:07,754 --> 01:15:09,130
Uh, eenie, meenie...

843
01:15:10,382 --> 01:15:12,092
Okay, that doesn't sound good.

844
01:15:12,342 --> 01:15:13,593
Minie...

845
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:14,761
...mo.

846
01:15:19,683 --> 01:15:21,059
Minie...

847
01:15:21,393 --> 01:15:22,435
...mo.

848
01:15:23,436 --> 01:15:25,313
Okay. Okay, good.

849
01:15:34,364 --> 01:15:36,491
Houston. Houston, in the blind.

850
01:15:36,741 --> 01:15:40,412
This is Mission Specialist Ryan Stone
reporting from the Shenzhou.

851
01:15:40,662 --> 01:15:43,331
I'm about to undock from Tiangong.

852
01:15:44,499 --> 01:15:45,625
Uh...

853
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:50,714
And I have a bad feeling
about this mission. Ha, ha.

854
01:15:52,674 --> 01:15:55,093
Reminds me of a story, Houston. Aah!

855
01:15:57,178 --> 01:16:01,182
Never... Never mind the story, Houston.
Never mind the story.

856
01:16:03,601 --> 01:16:06,688
It's getting hot in here. Okay. All right.

857
01:16:07,605 --> 01:16:08,690
Okay.

858
01:16:09,566 --> 01:16:11,443
All right, the way I see it...

859
01:16:11,693 --> 01:16:13,695
...there's only two possible outcomes.

860
01:16:13,945 --> 01:16:15,989
Either I make it down there in one piece...

861
01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:18,658
...and I have one hell of a story to tell...

862
01:16:19,117 --> 01:16:20,952
...or I burn up in the next 10 minutes.

863
01:16:21,202 --> 01:16:22,704
Aah.

864
01:16:23,079 --> 01:16:25,248
Either way, whichever way...

865
01:16:25,707 --> 01:16:28,376
...no harm, no foul! Aah!

866
01:16:35,049 --> 01:16:36,634
Because either way...

867
01:16:38,845 --> 01:16:41,222
...it'll be one hell of a ride.

868
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:44,893
I'm ready.
