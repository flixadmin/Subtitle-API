1
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:11,043
Unh!

2
00:00:12,712 --> 00:00:14,179
Unh.

3
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:21,920
Unh!

4
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:25,991
Unh! Unh!

5
00:00:26,826 --> 00:00:28,894
<i>Sayonara,</i> chumps.

6
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:39,438
Hiyah!

7
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:43,242
Jade?

8
00:00:43,244 --> 00:00:45,344
Now can I join
the j-team?

9
00:00:45,346 --> 00:00:46,845
Well...

10
00:00:46,847 --> 00:00:48,947
But I mopped the floor
with ninja butt.

11
00:00:48,949 --> 00:00:50,949
El solo me-o! Yipe!

12
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:52,184
No!

13
00:00:52,186 --> 00:00:53,552
Where are you
taking me?

14
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:54,787
Jade!

15
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:00,959
No. Not here.

16
00:01:00,961 --> 00:01:03,429
Not yet.

17
00:01:03,431 --> 00:01:05,297
Nice of you
to join us, Jade.

18
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:07,699
Would you care to read
your essay to the class?

19
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:09,968
Essay?

20
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,670
Aah!

21
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:13,305
(Gasping)

22
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:19,278
5 more shopping days

23
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,180
till the end
of Summer vacation.

24
00:01:21,182 --> 00:01:23,315
Yay.

25
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:22,274
Jackie, I keep having
the same weird dream.

26
00:02:22,276 --> 00:02:23,809
I show up to
the first day of class

27
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:26,778
without my
"what I did during
Summer vacation" essay.

28
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:30,616
Gee, perhaps you should
start writing your essay.

29
00:02:30,618 --> 00:02:33,652
Tch. You mean,
write about how boring
vacation's been?

30
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:37,156
We haven't seen
a single demon or ninja
or dark hand thug.

31
00:02:37,158 --> 00:02:39,892
Mmm. My kind of Summer.

32
00:02:39,894 --> 00:02:41,894
Black: Jackie.

33
00:02:41,896 --> 00:02:43,428
Could I see you a moment?

34
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,796
Aye, cap'n!

35
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:47,966
Funny.
I did not hear him
say <i> your</i> name.

36
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:49,835
It involves Jade.

37
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:51,436
That would be moi.

38
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:52,938
What did she do?

39
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:56,141
Not Jade the niece.
Jade the stone.

40
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:01,647
Jackie: Oh, I recognize
these pieces.

41
00:03:01,649 --> 00:03:04,383
Some of the finest examples
of emperor's Jade

42
00:03:04,385 --> 00:03:05,784
ever to exist.

43
00:03:05,786 --> 00:03:07,386
Until they vanished.

44
00:03:07,388 --> 00:03:08,453
As you know,
the collections

45
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:10,189
of nearly a dozen
Chinese museums

46
00:03:10,191 --> 00:03:12,157
have been hit over
the last decade,

47
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,693
and the thefts have
the same thing
in common.

48
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:18,330
No prints, no tracks,
no suspects.

49
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:20,098
Until now.

50
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,901
Section 13 agents
have been tracking
the movements

51
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:25,904
of taiwanese
billionaire
Bartholomew Chang.

52
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:27,573
His hand...

53
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:29,775
Made of Jade.

54
00:03:29,777 --> 00:03:30,909
(Door opens)

55
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:31,977
You rang?

56
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:33,111
Both: The stone.

57
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:34,179
Just checking.

58
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:38,517
Our biggest obstacle
is diplomatic.

59
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:40,052
The taiwanese government
believes Chang

60
00:03:40,054 --> 00:03:41,787
to be its greatest
philanthropist.

61
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:44,590
That's why
we can't make a move
on his island fortress

62
00:03:44,592 --> 00:03:47,893
without absolute proof
that he's stockpiling
the goods there.

63
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:50,295
And I can help you how?

64
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:51,730
Chang is about to host

65
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:54,166
his annual exclusive
martial arts tournament

66
00:03:54,168 --> 00:03:56,568
ostensibly for charity.

67
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,471
But I believe Chang
uses the tournament
as an audition

68
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:02,074
to recruit muscle
for his private army,

69
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:03,609
and the guest
transportation

70
00:04:03,611 --> 00:04:05,110
as a means
to smuggle Jade

71
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:07,679
onto the island
and off of it.

72
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:10,349
Ah. You want me
to attend the tournament

73
00:04:10,351 --> 00:04:11,817
as a contestant?

74
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:13,619
And find the...

75
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,155
(Whispers)
Jade.

76
00:04:17,157 --> 00:04:18,991
Captain black,
no offense,

77
00:04:18,993 --> 00:04:21,360
but this is way out
of Jackie's league.

78
00:04:21,362 --> 00:04:23,595
This is a job for...

79
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,464
The j-team!

80
00:04:25,466 --> 00:04:29,101
El toro fuerte,
wrestler extraordinaire.

81
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:34,106
Viper, mistress of hapkido,
pilates, and krav maga.

82
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:37,643
Tohru, the big, strong...

83
00:04:37,645 --> 00:04:39,645
Er, sumo.

84
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:42,247
Uh, yes.
Captain black,

85
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:44,149
I am sorry
that my niece has

86
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:46,118
such an active
imagination.

87
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,987
I like it.
Good work, kid.

88
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:50,856
Tohru: Sumo?

89
00:04:50,858 --> 00:04:53,225
But I am small
for a sumo.

90
00:04:53,227 --> 00:04:55,260
Well, you'll just
have to eat more.

91
00:04:55,262 --> 00:04:56,795
All part of
the training.

92
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,163
All right, t.,

93
00:04:58,165 --> 00:05:00,032
assume the position.

94
00:05:00,034 --> 00:05:02,434
Unh. Unh.

95
00:05:02,436 --> 00:05:03,902
Rrrr!

96
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:10,375
Unh.

97
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:11,576
Unh.

98
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:13,078
Unh!

99
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,013
Now, the name of the game

100
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:17,482
is to stay in the ring,
<i>capiche?</i>

101
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:18,817
Unh.

102
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,352
Hiyah!

103
00:05:20,354 --> 00:05:21,820
Unh!

104
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:23,855
(Gasps)

105
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:26,858
Earthquake!

106
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:32,097
You are very small
for a sumo.

107
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:35,167
Lesson number one:
Think big.

108
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,004
Thank you all
for coming

109
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:40,572
and for accepting
this mission.

110
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:41,973
I've taken
the Liberty

111
00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:44,142
of assigning
each of you
a code name.

112
00:05:44,144 --> 00:05:45,243
Hepcat.

113
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:47,045
Slippery McGee.

114
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:48,714
Fearless hyena.

115
00:05:48,716 --> 00:05:50,415
The big bopper.

116
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:52,017
And you can
call me...

117
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:54,119
When we get there

118
00:05:54,121 --> 00:05:57,456
to let you know
we arrived safely.

119
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:59,057
But this was my idea.

120
00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:02,327
The mission was gonna be
my perfect Summer getaway.

121
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:05,430
If I don't go,
paco doesn't go.

122
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:12,070
Paco <i> is</i> going, right?

123
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:13,138
Too dangerous.

124
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,707
Besides,
he is busy writing his

125
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,076
"what I did for
Summer vacation" essay.

126
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:19,678
Sorry, kiddo,

127
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,146
but let's you and me
go rollerblading

128
00:06:21,148 --> 00:06:22,481
as soon
as I get back.

129
00:06:22,483 --> 00:06:25,050
Sure thing, hepcat.

130
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:38,497
You're a real
master of disguise.

131
00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:41,633
El toro fuerte
never removes his mask.

132
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:43,835
Wish I could remove
these pajamas.

133
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:46,838
Not used to such
a roomy fit.

134
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,774
According
- to captain black,

135
00:06:48,776 --> 00:06:52,043
Chang gives a private tour
of his operations

136
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:53,945
to all tournament winners.

137
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:57,516
That would be the safest way
to gain access to the Jade.

138
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,318
(Fanfare plays)

139
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:07,793
Ready to go for the gold,
big bopper?

140
00:07:07,795 --> 00:07:08,960
Oh!

141
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:10,762
Jade!
How did you--

142
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,364
captain black said
the boats were used

143
00:07:12,366 --> 00:07:14,866
to smuggle Jade
onto the island, duh.

144
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:18,470
Ah! Not the niece,
the stone!

145
00:07:18,472 --> 00:07:20,772
Let the tournament begin.

146
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:23,341
Jujitsu contestants,

147
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:25,877
approach
the competition stage.

148
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,946
Senor fuerte,
you're on.

149
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,381
How do you know?

150
00:07:29,383 --> 00:07:30,749
Tch. Who'd you think

151
00:07:30,751 --> 00:07:33,084
was gonna register you guys
for your bouts?

152
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:40,826
(Grunting)

153
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:10,956
Yes!

154
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:13,725
An intriguing derivation
of jujitsu.

155
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:18,196
Aaahhh!

156
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:22,133
Oh, no! The "bounce-off-
the-ropes" maneuver!

157
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:23,301
What ropes?

158
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:25,504
Uh-oh.

159
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:26,738
All: Aah!

160
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:31,510
(Groans)

161
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:34,312
The champion.

162
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:38,083
This ain't <i> lucha libre,</i>
àhandsome.

163
00:08:38,085 --> 00:08:40,585
Ah, force of habit.

164
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,955
Iron fist contestants,

165
00:08:43,957 --> 00:08:46,291
approach
the competition stage.

166
00:08:46,293 --> 00:08:49,094
Show 'em who's boss,
fearless hyena.

167
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:51,997
(Grunting)

168
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:57,736
What?

169
00:08:57,738 --> 00:08:59,738
Why did you
sign me up for that?

170
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,541
Hello?
"Greatest victory,
battle not fought."

171
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:04,709
Thought you liked to avoid
hand-to-hand combat.

172
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:09,948
How did Chang
lose his hand,
anyway?

173
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,950
Iron fist competition.

174
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:16,855
Heh heh. Bricks.

175
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:30,936
Owww!

176
00:09:30,938 --> 00:09:32,904
Well, Jackie's out.

177
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:37,008
Not quite.

178
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,178
Best 2 out of 3.

179
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:49,654
Taibo: Contestants,
approach the competition
stage.

180
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:55,627
Viper's gonna rock
the tournament.

181
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:00,231
Hiyah!

182
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,571
The champion.

183
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:14,045
This clown suit's
really cramping
my style.

184
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:18,049
Sumo contestants,
approach the competition
stage.

185
00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:20,452
It's up to you, t.

186
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:22,654
Think big.
Think big.

187
00:10:22,656 --> 00:10:24,923
Think big. Think big.
Think big. Think big.

188
00:10:24,925 --> 00:10:26,658
Think big.

189
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,959
Think...

190
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,327
Big.

191
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:31,863
Hello, tiny.

192
00:10:31,865 --> 00:10:33,431
(Gulps)
Yeah.

193
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:01,493
Jade: Think big.

194
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:04,963
Huh?

195
00:11:04,965 --> 00:11:07,832
Aaarrrgh!

196
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:13,905
Whoa.

197
00:11:13,907 --> 00:11:16,574
Whoa, whoa.

198
00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:18,543
Whoa!

199
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:27,686
The champion!

200
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:31,156
Tohru, you da bomb.

201
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:33,091
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

202
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:34,859
I won?

203
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:37,028
I won!

204
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:44,736
(Knock on door)

205
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:46,805
Yes?

206
00:11:46,807 --> 00:11:48,139
Uh, mmm.
Good evening,

207
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:50,642
uh, Mr. referee.

208
00:11:50,644 --> 00:11:54,913
Taibo: Master Chang
requests your presence.

209
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:56,715
Chang has summoned tohru.

210
00:11:56,717 --> 00:11:58,483
Jade will be pleased
to hear this.

211
00:11:58,485 --> 00:12:00,051
No. Jade, eh,

212
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,821
Jade will be
pleased to remain
in her room.

213
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,128
(Footsteps approaching)

214
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,605
Sumo.

215
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:23,374
You fought like
a warrior today.

216
00:12:23,376 --> 00:12:26,411
Uh, I--I have
an excellent trainer.

217
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:31,082
Chang enterprises can
compensate you beyond
your wildest dreams,

218
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:35,120
if you
dedicate yourself
to serving my empire.

219
00:12:35,122 --> 00:12:36,988
Yes.

220
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:39,390
Very well.

221
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:44,062
(Beeping)

222
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,906
Champion, join
the privileged few.

223
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:58,710
Heh heh. Hello.

224
00:12:58,712 --> 00:13:00,178
Now behold...

225
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:06,751
One of my most
successful ventures.

226
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:08,453
Quilts.

227
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:12,557
All proceeds
go to charity.

228
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:13,658
Anything?

229
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,759
Song and dance.

230
00:13:14,761 --> 00:13:16,261
Chang won't show
his true colors

231
00:13:16,263 --> 00:13:18,062
until he's certain
he can trust tohru.

232
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:20,832
Chang: Cookies.

233
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:25,036
All proceeds
go to charity.

234
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:26,671
Yummy?

235
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,208
(Yawns)

236
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:36,781
Shh.

237
00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:38,283
Jade.

238
00:13:38,285 --> 00:13:39,784
Tohru has a visual.

239
00:13:39,786 --> 00:13:42,287
Er, the niece,
not the stone.

240
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:44,055
I have to get her
out of there.

241
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:45,456
You'll jeopardize
the mission.

242
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:46,624
And Jade won't?

243
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:48,860
50-50.

244
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:00,872
Jade!

245
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:04,409
Hey!
Hiyah!

246
00:14:04,411 --> 00:14:06,244
Huh?

247
00:14:06,246 --> 00:14:09,714
(Beeping)

248
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:22,627
(Gasps)

249
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:26,898
Jade!

250
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:31,636
And over here,

251
00:14:31,638 --> 00:14:35,173
the pride and Joy
of Chang enterprises...

252
00:14:35,175 --> 00:14:36,507
Basket weaving.

253
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:38,943
All proceeds go...

254
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:44,949
You!
Aah!

255
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:46,618
This area
is off limits.

256
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,719
What are you
doing?

257
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:49,020
Looking for Jade.

258
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:50,688
What Jade? There is
no Jade here.

259
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:51,756
I see no Jade.

260
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:54,325
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Jade, my niece,

261
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:55,860
not Jade the stone.

262
00:14:55,862 --> 00:14:57,028
Uh, have you seen it--

263
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,630
uh--uh, I mean, her?

264
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:03,668
No? Well, it was very nice
seeing you again.

265
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:05,003
Uh, thank you.
Bye-bye.

266
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:12,577
Are you certain
you wish to serve me?

267
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,479
Of course, master Chang.

268
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:16,848
Then prove yourself, sumo.

269
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:19,384
Bury our intruder.

270
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,962
(Gasps)

271
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:39,270
Heh heh,
nice sumo.

272
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:44,475
Unh!
Aah!

273
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:46,911
All: Unh!

274
00:15:46,913 --> 00:15:48,413
(All groan)

275
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:52,083
That was the best plan
you could come up with?

276
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:53,184
Yes.

277
00:15:53,186 --> 00:15:55,019
This way!

278
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:03,761
Jade?

279
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:07,098
The niece
or the stone?

280
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:12,303
My Jade!

281
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,007
Destroy them!

282
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:17,976
El toro:
Not so fast.

283
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:20,411
You were gonna
start the party
without us?

284
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,048
Rematch.

285
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:33,658
Watch the hands.
Please! Not the hands!

286
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:49,507
I win.

287
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:51,676
Not the hands.

288
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:02,120
Ropes, <i> por favor.</i>

289
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:17,101
Not the hands.

290
00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:20,304
<i>Amigo!</i> Tag team!

291
00:17:20,306 --> 00:17:23,241
Owww!

292
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:24,442
Sorry.

293
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,059
(Whistle)

294
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:57,275
You!

295
00:17:57,277 --> 00:17:58,776
(Gulps)

296
00:17:58,778 --> 00:18:01,112
I have never
lost a match

297
00:18:01,114 --> 00:18:03,181
until today.

298
00:18:03,183 --> 00:18:06,584
We humble ourselves
before you.

299
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:11,289
Let us even the odds.

300
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:12,790
Destroy them!

301
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:16,127
(All yelling)

302
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:48,392
You can run, Chang,

303
00:18:48,394 --> 00:18:51,863
but you can't hide
from the j-team.

304
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:05,309
Jackie could use
some helping hands.

305
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,246
Jade: Jackie!

306
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,755
Heh. Always brush
after soup?

307
00:19:17,757 --> 00:19:19,724
Aah!

308
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:24,996
(Gagging)

309
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:43,314
Unh!

310
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:45,283
Unh.

311
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:48,886
The champion!

312
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:51,422
(All groaning)

313
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:55,593
Thinking big?

314
00:19:55,595 --> 00:19:57,428
Livin' large.

315
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,731
Team, I hope
you'll consider

316
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:02,934
joining us
for future missions.

317
00:20:02,936 --> 00:20:04,569
Mmm, well...

318
00:20:04,571 --> 00:20:05,836
Both: We would
be honored.

319
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:08,239
So this makes me
official, right?

320
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:11,509
Well, let's just say
the "j" in j-team

321
00:20:11,511 --> 00:20:13,844
stands for more
than "Jackie."

322
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:20,184
And that's what I did

323
00:20:20,186 --> 00:20:22,987
on my mondo coolio
Summer vacation.

324
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:33,631
Hey, Jackie,
what is rushu?

325
00:20:33,633 --> 00:20:35,266
It's a little art.

326
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:37,602
It's like a dancing.

327
00:20:37,604 --> 00:20:39,237
Like me, when I'm playing
badminton.

328
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:40,605
Choo, ooh, ooh.

329
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:42,740
We're doing
this kind of things.
You have your own style.

330
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,809
You learn something
from me, ok,

331
00:20:44,811 --> 00:20:47,011
but later on you must
have your own style.

332
00:20:47,013 --> 00:20:48,045
Yeah.
