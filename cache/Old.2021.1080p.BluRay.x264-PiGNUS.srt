Sing it, girl.

8
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,672
Mom. Now I can't.

9
00:01:27,755 --> 00:01:30,508
Her spontaneity
has been stripped from her.

10
00:01:30,592 --> 00:01:33,553
I'm sorry.
You have such a beautiful voice.

11
00:01:33,636 --> 00:01:35,847
I can't wait to hear it
when you're older.

12
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:38,057
Will this place have scuba diving?

13
00:01:38,141 --> 00:01:40,977
How old does a child have to be
to do scuba diving?

14
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,270
I don't know, Trent.

15
00:01:43,021 --> 00:01:45,273
- I think you're a bit too young.
- You're a baby.

16
00:01:45,356 --> 00:01:49,152
You said five minutes. Technically,
it's been way, way more than five minutes.

17
00:01:49,235 --> 00:01:50,653
Are we close?

18
00:01:50,737 --> 00:01:52,614
Stop wishing away this moment.

19
00:01:53,323 --> 00:01:55,908
Look out the window,
look how pretty it is.

20
00:01:57,952 --> 00:01:58,953
Prisca.

21
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:01,706
Work stuff?

22
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:02,790
Yeah.

23
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:04,876
Lead by actions, Mom.

24
00:02:16,679 --> 00:02:17,764
Wow.

25
00:02:17,847 --> 00:02:20,141
This is much better than Cancún.

26
00:02:28,858 --> 00:02:32,862
Mr. and Mrs. Capa,
welcome to our version of paradise.

27
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:34,113
Wow.

28
00:02:34,197 --> 00:02:35,239
Hello!

29
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:42,413
So, this is Madrid.
She'll take care of you.

30
00:02:42,497 --> 00:02:45,249
From your food and beverage preferences
you selected,

31
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:47,794
we've made you cocktails to welcome you.

32
00:02:47,877 --> 00:02:48,878
Wow.

33
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:53,883
- Thank you.
- Look how big you guys are.

34
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:56,010
We have a drink fountain for you two.

35
00:02:56,761 --> 00:02:58,471
- Can we go?
- Mmm.

36
00:02:58,554 --> 00:02:59,806
- Yeah.
- Let's go, let's go.

37
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:04,143
Can you believe I found this online?

38
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:14,445
It's gorgeous.

39
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:20,702
My favorite thing,
open 24 hours,

40
00:03:20,785 --> 00:03:22,036
the candy station.

41
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,788
Oh, my God. Come on, Trent.

42
00:03:29,502 --> 00:03:32,004
Mix the vanilla and strawberry in it.

43
00:03:33,715 --> 00:03:35,174
Say hi, Trent.

44
00:03:35,925 --> 00:03:36,968
Hi.

45
00:03:37,802 --> 00:03:40,680
I'm Idlib.
My uncle's the resort manager here.

46
00:03:41,264 --> 00:03:43,349
He's Trent, I'm Maddox.

47
00:03:43,433 --> 00:03:47,019
I can do a thousand-piece jigsaw puzzle,
which is a considerable thing to do.

48
00:03:47,103 --> 00:03:50,022
My dad and I put clear glue on them
and then hang them on my wall.

49
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:52,817
I collect conch shells.

50
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,652
I have 42 conch shells.

51
00:03:55,611 --> 00:03:56,946
Amazing.

52
00:03:59,157 --> 00:04:01,033
- I might need a little help with this.
- Okay.

53
00:04:01,117 --> 00:04:02,717
Right, so you do strawberry and vanilla?

54
00:04:14,589 --> 00:04:15,798
Hi.

55
00:04:15,882 --> 00:04:17,675
Thank you. Yes.

56
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,220
Okay.
Okay, I got it. Okay, come on.

57
00:04:21,304 --> 00:04:23,598
Thank you. Heh.

58
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:27,018
Great job helping. Yes.

59
00:04:32,273 --> 00:04:34,901
- You!
- I touched your jacket, that...

60
00:04:34,984 --> 00:04:36,194
Hey!

61
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:41,032
There's 250,000 furniture-related injuries
in the United States per year.

62
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:44,786
25% of those, coffee table injuries.

63
00:04:44,869 --> 00:04:46,412
Hey. Hey!

64
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,790
- Fine.
- Okay.

65
00:04:58,007 --> 00:05:00,760
Warren and Warren
must be affiliated with this resort.

66
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:03,596
They must have conventions here.

67
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:08,643
We love this pharmaceutical company
at work.

68
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:12,159
We're considering asking our clients
to use Warren and Warren drugs

69
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:14,232
as a way to lower their insurance rates.

70
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:18,402
Ah. Hmm. Yeah.

71
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:22,198
"No kids allowed on the beach"?

72
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:23,866
What? Hold on.

73
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,911
- "No Kids Week"?
- That's not true! Let me see that!

74
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:28,834
It says no ki...
Prisca, you should've checked.

75
00:05:28,913 --> 00:05:30,557
- Let me see that!
- It's your mom's fault.

76
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:31,975
No, really, no. It says this, no...

77
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:34,019
- Let me see!
- She should've checked. It says this.

78
00:05:34,043 --> 00:05:35,229
- Let me see!
- Yes, of course.

79
00:05:35,253 --> 00:05:39,298
I know this is
very painful news for you all to bear.

80
00:05:39,382 --> 00:05:41,634
But now, now I've got the power.

81
00:05:41,717 --> 00:05:43,737
Yes! And you have to do it.

82
00:05:43,761 --> 00:05:46,264
Yeah, you have to understand.
It's like this.

83
00:05:46,347 --> 00:05:47,467
- Daddy!
- Life is like this.

84
00:05:47,515 --> 00:05:50,017
It's tough and sometimes
it doesn't go the way you want it to.

85
00:06:04,073 --> 00:06:06,242
Come on! Blue team is winning.

86
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:11,289
What's your name
and what do you do for a living?

87
00:06:11,372 --> 00:06:13,749
Hey, guys. I'm Annette. What's your name?

88
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:15,209
I'm Trent. This is Idlib.

89
00:06:15,293 --> 00:06:16,836
Hey, nice to meet you.

90
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:18,713
- Bye.
- Bye.

91
00:06:18,796 --> 00:06:19,797
Bye.

92
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:25,303
Hi, I'm Trent. This is Idlib.

93
00:06:25,386 --> 00:06:27,513
What are your names,
and what do you do for a living?

94
00:06:27,597 --> 00:06:29,348
Well, I'm Sophia Watson.

95
00:06:29,432 --> 00:06:30,600
I'm a chef.

96
00:06:30,683 --> 00:06:32,226
I'm Greg Mitchell. I'm a cop.

97
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,394
Cool.

98
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:35,771
And I'm Malin Mitchell. I'm a dancer.

99
00:06:35,855 --> 00:06:37,481
Wow. That's cool.

100
00:06:37,565 --> 00:06:38,983
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

101
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:40,776
- Hey, let's go over there.
- Bye.

102
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,445
Come on, let's go over there.

103
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,294
Truth-telling game. Go.

104
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,130
I can't do a push-up. Go.

105
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,593
I don't have friends.

106
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:08,095
I'm your friend.

107
00:07:08,179 --> 00:07:09,597
You'll leave.

108
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,390
My mom might let me FaceTime you.

109
00:07:11,474 --> 00:07:13,267
Then we can be friends.

110
00:07:13,351 --> 00:07:16,354
You can come over to my house
and make up stories.

111
00:07:16,437 --> 00:07:19,065
Then we can go to
the same college together

112
00:07:19,148 --> 00:07:21,317
and become neighbors with mortgages.

113
00:07:22,652 --> 00:07:23,653
Cool.

114
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:28,991
It's weird.

115
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:31,744
I know.

116
00:07:32,954 --> 00:07:35,915
It's hanging over me. I can barely eat.

117
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:37,708
And I don't feel anything?

118
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:41,796
We agreed.

119
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:44,423
We'd give them one last vacation
before telling them.

120
00:07:45,091 --> 00:07:47,760
I can't understand
why we don't take into consideration...

121
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:49,887
That shouldn't affect anything.

122
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:53,349
The doctor said it's a non-factor.

123
00:07:53,975 --> 00:07:56,435
It's probably been there for years,
he said.

124
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,357
We were on a course to separate.

125
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:04,360
That's confusing enough for us.

126
00:08:05,111 --> 00:08:08,614
Let's not bring an irrelevant
medical condition into this.

127
00:08:10,116 --> 00:08:11,951
Let's get through this, Guy.

128
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:14,412
Compartmentalize.

129
00:08:14,954 --> 00:08:16,539
It's only for three days.

130
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:17,915
You found a place?

131
00:08:17,999 --> 00:08:19,000
Yes.

132
00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:21,419
Oh, Prisca. Come on.

133
00:08:25,965 --> 00:08:28,968
You're always thinking about the future!

134
00:08:29,051 --> 00:08:31,220
It makes me feel not seen!

135
00:08:32,013 --> 00:08:33,848
You're always thinking
about the past.

136
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:35,975
You work in a goddamn museum!

137
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:42,982
I think they stopped.

138
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:46,402
Why don't you play?

139
00:10:06,816 --> 00:10:09,235
Good morning.
What would you like for breakfast?

140
00:10:10,111 --> 00:10:13,614
I'll have the Calcium Bomb juice drink.
I have a calcium deficiency.

141
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,617
So, is it really calcium rich
or just a catchy name?

142
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,829
It has all calcium-rich vegetables, ma'am.

143
00:10:20,913 --> 00:10:23,207
- Sit up, Kara, honey.
- Okay.

144
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,376
You don't wanna be hunched
when you grow up, baby.

145
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:26,794
It's very unattractive.

146
00:10:27,503 --> 00:10:29,255
Boys will get turned off.

147
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:32,258
Give me the Calcium Bomb juice.

148
00:10:33,551 --> 00:10:37,263
And maybe you could
recommend one of these.

149
00:10:40,975 --> 00:10:41,976
This one.

150
00:10:42,852 --> 00:10:45,146
I recommend the granola parfait.

151
00:10:47,106 --> 00:10:48,232
It's a good choice.

152
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:49,483
Okay.

153
00:10:49,567 --> 00:10:51,443
So, how is the Capa family?

154
00:10:51,527 --> 00:10:52,736
Any plans today?

155
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:56,574
Well, one of our kids
wants to do Jet Ski.

156
00:10:56,657 --> 00:11:00,452
And the other one
wants to do anything but that.

157
00:11:00,536 --> 00:11:01,662
Aha.

158
00:11:02,288 --> 00:11:04,373
Well, there's, um...

159
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:07,585
there's a private beach
on the nature preserve side of the island.

160
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:09,211
It's impossible to find.

161
00:11:09,295 --> 00:11:12,548
It's surrounded by stunning rocks,
very unusual minerals.

162
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:15,426
It's a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

163
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:17,344
A natural anomaly.

164
00:11:18,888 --> 00:11:21,307
I only recommend it to certain guests.

165
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:24,226
But I liked you guys immediately.
All right?

166
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:28,147
You're a nice family.
So I could arrange a van to take you, if...

167
00:11:28,731 --> 00:11:29,732
Yeah.

168
00:11:30,441 --> 00:11:32,651
Sounds like a great memory for us.

169
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:35,863
It's our little secret.
I'll make all the arrangements.

170
00:11:37,448 --> 00:11:39,008
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

171
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:40,367
Thanks.

172
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:45,539
Okay, so I think we should get
the Calloway Kale-away for Trent.

173
00:11:45,623 --> 00:11:49,001
Idlib, what did I tell you about
being in here when you shouldn't?

174
00:11:50,211 --> 00:11:52,713
You can't...
You know, I told you so many times.

175
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:54,256
You know, we have certain rules...

176
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,143
I'm a doctor.

177
00:12:06,227 --> 00:12:07,645
My wife has epilepsy.

178
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:09,813
I'm a nurse. My name is Jarin.

179
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:12,524
Right, she's having a grand mal seizure.

180
00:12:12,608 --> 00:12:14,526
Keep things away from her, please.

181
00:12:18,197 --> 00:12:19,198
Patricia?

182
00:12:20,366 --> 00:12:21,367
Doll.

183
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,637
Jack, I think if you just
leave her lying here for a while,

184
00:12:23,661 --> 00:12:25,513
put something under her head.
I think she'll be fine.

185
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:28,040
Thank you, Doctor.
It's Jarin, by the way.

186
00:12:31,627 --> 00:12:34,713
For my next act,
I'll spin my head around 360.

187
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:39,593
I'm sorry I ruined everyone's breakfast.

188
00:12:39,677 --> 00:12:41,553
You always want to be
the center of attention.

189
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:46,684
My goodness.
Let's get you something to drink?

190
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:47,768
Yeah.

191
00:12:56,902 --> 00:12:57,987
Idlib.

192
00:13:12,001 --> 00:13:14,795
Can't be that secret a beach.
We were told to keep it quiet.

193
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:17,756
- So were we.
- Sit down, Gustav. Good boy.

194
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,510
Good boy. Stay.

195
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:26,056
Okay, guest checklist.

196
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,975
Books, sunscreen.

197
00:13:28,976 --> 00:13:31,312
Did everybody
leave their passports in their safes?

198
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:33,605
- I don't want anybody to lose anything.
- Yeah.

199
00:13:34,315 --> 00:13:36,358
What are your names and occupations?

200
00:14:07,765 --> 00:14:09,016
It's very rocky here.

201
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:10,601
Okay, my friends.

202
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,020
You can just call us,

203
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:15,564
and we'll pick you up
whenever you're ready to come back.

204
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:17,483
Or I'll pick you up at 5:00 p.m.

205
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:19,568
Just follow the path down to the beach.

206
00:14:20,277 --> 00:14:21,862
- Is that also food?
- Yeah.

207
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:25,157
Wow, that's a lot of food.

208
00:14:25,741 --> 00:14:29,161
Well, kids eat a lot of food.
And you got three of them with you.

209
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:30,662
Okay.

210
00:14:30,746 --> 00:14:33,248
Seems like a waste,
but thank you.

211
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:39,254
Could you help us
carry some of these bags, please?

212
00:14:39,338 --> 00:14:41,507
We've got an elderly person here
and a child.

213
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:44,426
I'm sorry. I gotta get back.
But it's not far.

214
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:47,012
Just walk down.
You'll see a beautiful slot canyon.

215
00:14:47,096 --> 00:14:50,265
Walk through that, and in a few minutes,
you'll be there. Enjoy, everybody!

216
00:14:50,349 --> 00:14:52,226
- Do you think there's...
- Come on.

217
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:55,187
- Do you think there's snakes?
- Of course.

218
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,106
Cool. I wanna see one.

219
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:00,317
- Gorgeous.
- Wow.

220
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:06,240
Okay.

221
00:15:08,826 --> 00:15:11,870
You okay? Yeah?

222
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:34,184
Could someone please
tell me what just happened?

223
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:35,936
Look out.

224
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:38,230
- This is so exciting!
- Careful now.

225
00:15:48,866 --> 00:15:50,659
- Let's go!
- I'm gonna win!

226
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:52,119
Whoo!

227
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:21,273
Wow. I just got chills.

228
00:16:23,734 --> 00:16:26,653
Come on, darling.
Let's show Gustav the sea.

229
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:30,949
Hey, Maddox, help your mom.

230
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:32,826
Listen, I... Let's move somewhere else.

231
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:35,037
I think it's much nicer
closer to the water, right?

232
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,623
- Yeah, but I...
- No, it's... Look. It's beautiful.

233
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:38,749
I got you!

234
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:54,139
Have you ever
seen anything like that?

235
00:16:58,477 --> 00:17:00,562
They were right to send us.

236
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,190
Lie down.

237
00:17:04,942 --> 00:17:07,110
Yeah. Good boy!

238
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:10,572
Kids, look at the beautiful coral.

239
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:16,411
- What are you going to do?
- Now I'm gonna splash you.

240
00:17:16,495 --> 00:17:18,413
Just keep on reading, I guess.

241
00:17:18,497 --> 00:17:19,873
You just splashed me.

242
00:17:20,582 --> 00:17:23,168
Stop! I didn't mean you could splash me.

243
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:25,420
Guy?

244
00:17:25,504 --> 00:17:26,505
Yeah.

245
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:29,007
What book am I reading?

246
00:17:34,096 --> 00:17:35,305
I don't know.

247
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:38,100
Why?

248
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:40,811
No reason.

249
00:17:45,524 --> 00:17:48,694
Prisca,
I wanted to tell you something.

250
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:55,367
No, never mind.

251
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:57,202
I'll tell you later.

252
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,167
Oh, my God.

253
00:18:05,127 --> 00:18:06,962
That's Mid-Sized Sedan.

254
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:08,505
What? Mid what?

255
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:09,923
He's a rapper!

256
00:18:10,007 --> 00:18:11,717
"More Dough for the Cookin" '?

257
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:15,071
- Mid-Sized Sedan?
- Let's begin an activity.

258
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:16,722
Dad, I have to, okay? I have to!

259
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:19,391
- No. Leave him. Because it's a private...
- Sounds like fun.

260
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:22,644
- But, Dad, stop! I need to say hi.
- He's on vacation, he's on vacation.

261
00:18:22,728 --> 00:18:24,354
What's his surname? Sedan?

262
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:26,315
Whoo!

263
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:29,484
Oh!

264
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:35,365
Whoa, all right.
Here's a big one. Wow.

265
00:18:35,449 --> 00:18:37,200
Help me with this.

266
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,413
We should have a housewarming party.

267
00:18:42,664 --> 00:18:44,875
Isn't our house so beautiful?

268
00:18:58,472 --> 00:19:00,432
- Boo!
- Aah! You!

269
00:19:00,515 --> 00:19:01,933
- Come! Come back here!
- No!

270
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:04,811
Not gonna get me!

271
00:19:04,895 --> 00:19:07,022
Kara, you know,
I'm gonna get you right now.

272
00:19:07,773 --> 00:19:08,774
Come on.

273
00:19:08,857 --> 00:19:09,900
Not gonna get me!

274
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:10,984
Oh, I am.

275
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:13,111
Come on, Kara.

276
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:16,114
Oh!

277
00:19:16,198 --> 00:19:17,741
Oh, my God. Got you.

278
00:19:21,662 --> 00:19:23,080
You're never gonna catch me.

279
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:27,459
Honey, I'm home.

280
00:19:27,542 --> 00:19:30,253
I told you, I don't wanna live like this.

281
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:32,297
I'm gonna live in a condominium.

282
00:19:32,381 --> 00:19:34,508
I'm going for a drive to calm down.

283
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:38,053
I'm really, really hungry.

284
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:41,056
Me, too. My stomach's growling.

285
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:42,140
Me, too.

286
00:19:57,531 --> 00:19:58,657
Wow.

287
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:01,576
Who would leave this?

288
00:20:02,786 --> 00:20:03,787
Hey, Mom!

289
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:06,415
From the hotel.

290
00:20:07,082 --> 00:20:09,000
They're so rusted.

291
00:20:09,084 --> 00:20:10,293
Put that down!

292
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:13,004
You can get infected
or you'll cut yourself!

293
00:20:13,922 --> 00:20:15,215
Come away.

294
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:16,299
Next activity.

295
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:18,194
- What's happening?
- Let's play hide-and-seek.

296
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:20,679
I don't know. They found stuff
from the hotel in the sand.

297
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:25,934
Eighteen, nineteen, twenty.

298
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:28,353
- No fish.
- Ready or not, here we come!

299
00:20:45,537 --> 00:20:46,538
Mom!

300
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:49,833
Mom! Mom!

301
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,835
Mom! Mom!

302
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:53,628
Mom!

303
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:58,759
- What is it? What is it?
- Trent!

304
00:20:58,842 --> 00:21:00,010
Someone over there.

305
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:01,094
Over there.

306
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:13,857
Come on. Give me a hand. Get the legs.

307
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:14,941
Yes.

308
00:21:24,326 --> 00:21:26,453
- Make your list. Make your list.
- Okay.

309
00:21:26,536 --> 00:21:27,829
Red and orange.

310
00:21:27,913 --> 00:21:29,956
Red, orange. Come away from here, babies.

311
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,709
Let the doctor try and help this lady.
Yeah?

312
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:34,252
- Green.
- Green.

313
00:21:36,797 --> 00:21:37,839
- Tan.
- Tan.

314
00:21:37,923 --> 00:21:38,924
- Purple.
- Purple.

315
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:40,487
- What happened?
- It's okay.

316
00:21:41,384 --> 00:21:43,303
Blue. Blue is good. And then?

317
00:21:43,386 --> 00:21:44,906
- Green.
- Green, yes.

318
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:47,241
- Yellow. Purple.
- Yellow. I love yellow.

319
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:48,558
Call the police, right?

320
00:21:48,642 --> 00:21:49,768
I'll get my mobile.

321
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,604
Oh, damn.

322
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:15,001
What happened to her, Mom?

323
00:22:15,085 --> 00:22:16,378
I don't know.

324
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:18,463
I'm still hungry.

325
00:22:18,547 --> 00:22:19,756
Me, too.

326
00:22:21,883 --> 00:22:23,093
Was she with you?

327
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:24,736
I was waiting for her.

328
00:22:25,387 --> 00:22:27,806
She swam out by herself, yo.

329
00:22:28,932 --> 00:22:30,642
I don't know what the hell happened.

330
00:22:31,268 --> 00:22:32,769
I ain't saying nothing else.

331
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:36,231
Did you strike him?
I don't need to know the context of...

332
00:22:36,314 --> 00:22:38,066
What? No. Of course not.

333
00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:39,526
So why's your nose bleeding?

334
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:43,530
I told y'all,
I ain't got nothing to say to you.

335
00:22:47,242 --> 00:22:49,327
My chest feels funny.

336
00:22:50,871 --> 00:22:55,584
Well, you know, we should've
gotten a yacht like I suggested, Agnes.

337
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:57,544
You shouldn't have fought me on that.

338
00:22:58,503 --> 00:23:01,464
You see? Now we're mixed up
in some island issue.

339
00:23:01,548 --> 00:23:02,924
I mean, I...

340
00:23:08,471 --> 00:23:12,100
Mom, my swimsuit is hurting.
I have to take it off.

341
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:14,436
Well, just loosen your...

342
00:23:20,275 --> 00:23:21,818
We're from Philadelphia.

343
00:23:21,902 --> 00:23:24,154
I'm on a break here
with my wife and kids. That's them.

344
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:26,948
Well, yeah, over there.

345
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:32,203
And for the record,
I know most people who die on vacation

346
00:23:32,287 --> 00:23:36,207
die from sun exposure, overexertion,

347
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:38,376
overindulgence of food or alcohol,

348
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:41,963
or a mixture of all of the above
99.4% of the time.

349
00:23:42,047 --> 00:23:44,090
- How you know all this?
- I'm an actuary.

350
00:23:44,174 --> 00:23:47,385
I calculate people's insurance rates
based on their risk profile.

351
00:23:49,721 --> 00:23:51,348
I ain't do nothing, man.

352
00:23:54,434 --> 00:23:55,810
She was into me.

353
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:00,523
Somebody will figure this out.

354
00:24:01,566 --> 00:24:03,735
We'll just have to wait
for them to get here.

355
00:24:03,818 --> 00:24:06,321
No reception at all.

356
00:24:07,072 --> 00:24:09,407
I guess our beach day's over.

357
00:24:09,491 --> 00:24:11,701
We've gotta keep an eye on him
and the body.

358
00:24:11,785 --> 00:24:14,245
Whoo!

359
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,290
Oh, my goodness.

360
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:19,584
Wow.

361
00:24:22,504 --> 00:24:24,547
Did you just get dropped off
by the resort?

362
00:24:24,631 --> 00:24:28,176
Yeah. We were supposed to come earlier,
but we rested in the room first.

363
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:31,012
Great. We have to get the resort people
before they leave.

364
00:24:31,096 --> 00:24:32,856
I think we will all
have to leave this beach.

365
00:24:32,931 --> 00:24:35,642
Wait. Why? They left already.

366
00:24:35,725 --> 00:24:36,893
What happened?

367
00:24:49,322 --> 00:24:50,949
We really don't know what happened.

368
00:24:51,032 --> 00:24:53,118
Well, I think this man
had something to do with it.

369
00:24:53,201 --> 00:24:56,329
Man, if I was involved, why would I
be standing around, bro? Damn.

370
00:24:56,413 --> 00:24:59,708
His nose is bleeding. I think he got that
when she was trying to defend herself.

371
00:24:59,791 --> 00:25:01,251
I don't like this dynamic at all.

372
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:04,295
My nose has been bleeding for hours, man.
I don't know why it's doing that.

373
00:25:04,379 --> 00:25:08,341
Charles, something's wrong with
your mother. She's asking for you, honey.

374
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,928
Well, we're all in this now.

375
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:14,514
We are responsible for that woman.

376
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:18,727
And I've got nothing against this man.
I'm just doing what needs to be done.

377
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,813
No cell phone reception
on this beach.

378
00:25:21,896 --> 00:25:22,897
You stay here.

379
00:25:22,981 --> 00:25:25,984
I'll go to the clearing in the jungle
where they dropped us and try to call.

380
00:25:26,067 --> 00:25:29,654
They obviously have a signal out here.
How else do people call to go back?

381
00:25:47,964 --> 00:25:49,132
Oh, my God.

382
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,343
You stumbled back out,
you were holding your head.

383
00:25:52,427 --> 00:25:54,262
You looked like you were in pain, babe.

384
00:25:55,555 --> 00:25:56,681
You blacked out.

385
00:25:58,183 --> 00:25:59,851
I felt this pressure in my head.

386
00:26:04,939 --> 00:26:06,149
I'm fine, Charles.

387
00:26:07,275 --> 00:26:08,651
I think it's the shock.

388
00:26:09,819 --> 00:26:11,905
Try to help Gustav or he'll be sick.

389
00:26:11,988 --> 00:26:13,281
Yeah, of course it's the shock.

390
00:26:13,364 --> 00:26:15,492
I'm gonna get a van
to take us back to the resort,

391
00:26:15,575 --> 00:26:17,660
but first I've got to deal
with all this, all right?

392
00:26:18,453 --> 00:26:19,662
Are you okay?

393
00:26:19,746 --> 00:26:20,747
Yeah.

394
00:26:21,414 --> 00:26:23,083
I know you've been stressed.

395
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:25,335
Don't let this upset you.

396
00:26:26,336 --> 00:26:28,546
Help these people through this, Charles.

397
00:26:30,256 --> 00:26:31,633
So, what did you hear?

398
00:26:33,718 --> 00:26:35,929
Help these people through this, Charles.

399
00:26:36,012 --> 00:26:37,180
Excuse me.

400
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:42,644
Excuse me.
I saw you were talking to my husband.

401
00:26:42,727 --> 00:26:45,647
I know you're dealing with a lot
with that woman right now,

402
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:48,358
but something is wrong with my son.
Some kind of reaction.

403
00:26:48,441 --> 00:26:50,610
Is it severe? I don't have time for this.

404
00:26:50,693 --> 00:26:52,237
What kind of doctor are you?

405
00:26:52,904 --> 00:26:55,198
I'm a cardiothoracic surgeon
and chief medical officer.

406
00:26:55,949 --> 00:26:57,617
You don't know me.

407
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,911
I curate exhibits for museums.

408
00:27:00,578 --> 00:27:02,705
I'm telling you this
because I want you to trust me

409
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:04,916
and not think I'm being hysterical
when I say

410
00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:07,335
there's something very wrong
with my child.

411
00:27:07,418 --> 00:27:09,587
He seems fine to me.
He's playing with my daughter.

412
00:27:11,214 --> 00:27:13,007
You look different, too.

413
00:27:13,091 --> 00:27:14,092
How?

414
00:27:14,968 --> 00:27:18,304
Huh? I don't know.
You just look different.

415
00:27:19,722 --> 00:27:20,932
Hold my hand.

416
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:22,642
Okay.

417
00:27:25,478 --> 00:27:28,481
Willow, Japanese maple.

418
00:27:29,691 --> 00:27:32,068
- Evergreen.
- If you get scared, just tell me, okay?

419
00:27:33,778 --> 00:27:35,238
What do you keep looking at?

420
00:27:35,989 --> 00:27:37,782
- There.
- Where?

421
00:27:39,117 --> 00:27:41,953
Way, way up there
on the side of the hillside.

422
00:27:42,036 --> 00:27:43,371
What do you see?

423
00:27:43,454 --> 00:27:45,331
I thought I saw something shiny.

424
00:27:46,583 --> 00:27:47,584
Here comes Mom.

425
00:27:51,171 --> 00:27:54,757
Charles!
She stopped breathing!

426
00:27:54,841 --> 00:27:56,551
She stopped breathing!

427
00:27:59,095 --> 00:28:01,139
I didn't do anything, Charles.

428
00:28:01,222 --> 00:28:03,141
You guys, you just walked away,

429
00:28:03,224 --> 00:28:05,602
and she just stopped breathing
all of a sudden.

430
00:28:05,685 --> 00:28:07,187
I mean, she was peaceful.

431
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:09,439
Can you step back, please?

432
00:28:09,522 --> 00:28:11,399
We'll take the kids
away from here.

433
00:28:11,983 --> 00:28:13,443
Is this happening?

434
00:28:25,997 --> 00:28:27,582
She couldn't take the shock.

435
00:28:28,958 --> 00:28:31,961
She saw a murdered woman
and her heart couldn't take it.

436
00:28:33,046 --> 00:28:35,131
What are your names
and occupations?

437
00:28:35,798 --> 00:28:37,800
I'm Jarin. I'm a nurse.

438
00:28:37,884 --> 00:28:40,720
I'm Patricia. I'm a psychologist.

439
00:28:40,803 --> 00:28:43,890
He remembers everyone's names
and things about them.

440
00:28:44,682 --> 00:28:46,309
Everything's gonna be okay.

441
00:28:47,268 --> 00:28:48,394
What's your name?

442
00:28:49,103 --> 00:28:51,981
I'm Trent.
This is my sister, Maddox.

443
00:28:52,065 --> 00:28:53,566
How old are you guys?

444
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:56,110
I'll guess. I'm good at this.

445
00:28:56,694 --> 00:28:58,279
You're 11, right, Trent?

446
00:28:59,197 --> 00:29:00,406
I'm six.

447
00:29:00,949 --> 00:29:04,410
No. Really, are you 10, 11?

448
00:29:04,494 --> 00:29:07,247
He's not lying. He's six.

449
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:10,166
I'm specifically six and a quarter.

450
00:29:10,792 --> 00:29:11,876
She's 11.

451
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:16,256
They're feeling unsafe.
There is a lot going on here.

452
00:29:16,339 --> 00:29:19,467
They're playing with us. Let's leave it.

453
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:22,053
Okay, what's your best friend's name?

454
00:29:22,929 --> 00:29:24,138
Maddox.

455
00:29:24,931 --> 00:29:26,182
How sweet.

456
00:29:26,766 --> 00:29:28,351
Have you seen my children?

457
00:29:29,852 --> 00:29:32,647
Is everyone trying to play a joke on us?

458
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:34,774
- What?
- Aren't these your children?

459
00:29:35,316 --> 00:29:36,609
I'm right here, Mom.

460
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,363
Mom?

461
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,241
Mom.

462
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:53,960
Why are you looking at me like that?

463
00:30:04,595 --> 00:30:07,890
Prisca, I think we should leave.

464
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,601
Get the kids back to the resort.

465
00:30:10,685 --> 00:30:11,894
Guy...

466
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,748
- Maddox?
- Yeah. Dad, it's me.

467
00:30:35,835 --> 00:30:37,211
What's going on?

468
00:30:48,765 --> 00:30:50,933
You see? You see?

469
00:31:08,034 --> 00:31:09,327
Holy...

470
00:31:43,277 --> 00:31:44,487
Damn.

471
00:31:45,405 --> 00:31:47,323
- How did we get here?
- Take it easy.

472
00:31:48,908 --> 00:31:52,537
Intense cranial pressure.
It's like being deep underwater.

473
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:55,623
- I can't...
- Can you get up?

474
00:31:55,706 --> 00:31:56,791
Whoa. Whoa. Take it easy.

475
00:31:59,752 --> 00:32:01,170
Charles?

476
00:32:01,254 --> 00:32:03,423
- Yeah, no, I'm all right. I'm fine.
- You okay?

477
00:32:03,506 --> 00:32:05,925
We're leaving right now,
and we're taking our kids.

478
00:32:06,008 --> 00:32:08,928
For some reason,
people are blacking out going this way.

479
00:32:09,011 --> 00:32:10,596
Three people have blacked out now.

480
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,866
- That's ridiculous. Come, move.
- No, I saw it, Prisca.

481
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:13,933
I saw Jarin black out.

482
00:32:14,016 --> 00:32:18,479
What I know is that we have to get
these kids to a hospital. Now.

483
00:32:19,897 --> 00:32:22,150
Look, let's stop talking about it.

484
00:32:22,233 --> 00:32:23,568
The kids are scared.

485
00:32:23,651 --> 00:32:25,069
I can stay here with them.

486
00:32:25,153 --> 00:32:30,199
But everyone else should try and find
a different pathway off this beach.

487
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:33,995
Break off into groups of two
in case people black out.

488
00:32:36,414 --> 00:32:37,874
Chrystal, go with me.

489
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:57,530
- Okay.
- Whatever you do, just stay close.

490
00:32:57,602 --> 00:32:59,812
I'm feeling very uncomfortable right now.

491
00:33:00,354 --> 00:33:01,898
Don't get up too quickly.

492
00:33:01,981 --> 00:33:04,525
Kids, let Mom and Dad talk for a second.

493
00:33:04,609 --> 00:33:06,527
No. Mom, we're scared.

494
00:33:07,361 --> 00:33:09,614
Please. Stay right here.

495
00:33:10,573 --> 00:33:11,616
Okay?

496
00:33:12,867 --> 00:33:15,286
- If I cry, please don't let them see.
- I won't.

497
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:17,538
- Your hands are shaking.
- Yeah.

498
00:33:17,622 --> 00:33:18,748
- Yeah.
- Yeah, they are.

499
00:33:18,831 --> 00:33:20,458
Yeah. You okay?

500
00:33:21,751 --> 00:33:24,212
We're on a beach
with two unrelated dead bodies.

501
00:33:24,295 --> 00:33:26,255
That is just statistically impossible.

502
00:33:26,339 --> 00:33:28,257
All three kids are reacting to something.

503
00:33:28,341 --> 00:33:29,759
Only the kids.

504
00:33:29,842 --> 00:33:31,886
I mean, look at the doctor's daughter.

505
00:33:34,055 --> 00:33:36,182
The kids are reacting
to something they ate.

506
00:33:36,933 --> 00:33:38,893
Or they caught something.

507
00:33:38,976 --> 00:33:43,105
We're on a remote, undeveloped island,
but we have a doctor here.

508
00:33:43,189 --> 00:33:46,526
So, let's get the doctor
to look at the kids.

509
00:33:54,575 --> 00:33:56,911
I still can't get any reception.

510
00:33:57,495 --> 00:33:59,664
Doctor, before we do anything else,

511
00:33:59,747 --> 00:34:01,624
can you take a look
at our children, please?

512
00:34:02,917 --> 00:34:04,001
Oh!

513
00:34:05,086 --> 00:34:06,212
He's got a knife!

514
00:34:07,713 --> 00:34:09,674
There's a damn hole in my cheek!

515
00:34:10,258 --> 00:34:13,344
- Oh, my God! Are you okay?
- Put that down right now, Doctor.

516
00:34:13,427 --> 00:34:14,804
Watch out, Jarin.

517
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:19,069
Listen, I don't know why I did that.
I thought he was gonna hurt me.

518
00:34:19,141 --> 00:34:20,309
Sorry.

519
00:34:22,061 --> 00:34:24,230
- Sorry.
- What's he talking about, "sorry"?

520
00:34:24,313 --> 00:34:26,649
- Let me see that laceration.
- That's assault, man!

521
00:34:26,732 --> 00:34:28,067
Calm down.

522
00:34:29,694 --> 00:34:30,945
What's your name?

523
00:34:32,071 --> 00:34:33,489
Mid-Sized Sedan.

524
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,078
I must be in shock. I'm numb.
I'm not feeling the pain no more.

525
00:34:39,161 --> 00:34:41,372
Please. Let me see.

526
00:34:49,589 --> 00:34:51,229
No, this is not making any sense, Prisca.

527
00:34:51,299 --> 00:34:53,968
I need to get my ass to a hospital now.

528
00:34:55,136 --> 00:34:56,887
What's with all y'all faces?

529
00:34:59,223 --> 00:35:00,891
It's hard to explain.

530
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:07,398
This is messed up, man.
Where'd it go?

531
00:35:07,481 --> 00:35:09,609
This is some kind of parlor trick.

532
00:35:09,692 --> 00:35:14,071
Yo, I know
I tried to dip, but I am freaked, man.

533
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:17,283
I just wanna go back to my hotel room.

534
00:35:17,366 --> 00:35:20,745
This was supposed to be a zen trip, man.

535
00:35:20,828 --> 00:35:24,165
She and I only started talking
because she was sick, and so am I.

536
00:35:24,248 --> 00:35:27,460
She had just been diagnosed with MS,
so we started rapping about that.

537
00:35:27,543 --> 00:35:29,629
I didn't do nothing to that girl, man.

538
00:35:31,088 --> 00:35:33,549
She was like Michael Phelps
swimming out there,

539
00:35:33,633 --> 00:35:34,800
backstroking and whatnot.

540
00:35:34,884 --> 00:35:36,302
She swam way the hell out.

541
00:35:36,385 --> 00:35:37,637
What did you say?

542
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,805
No, I don't know, man.
Maybe it was butterfly stroke.

543
00:35:39,889 --> 00:35:41,609
I don't watch the Summer Olympics
like that.

544
00:35:41,682 --> 00:35:43,601
You came vacationing here
because you were sick,

545
00:35:43,684 --> 00:35:45,954
- and so did she?
- I thought that was a cool coincidence.

546
00:35:45,978 --> 00:35:49,649
Maybe this is some kind of
group psychosis. I've studied this.

547
00:35:49,732 --> 00:35:52,485
We're all emotionally shaky
from our lives.

548
00:35:52,568 --> 00:35:55,821
We don't believe
we can leave this beach.

549
00:36:00,076 --> 00:36:01,494
Mom.

550
00:36:01,577 --> 00:36:04,246
Is there any more food?
I'm still hungry.

551
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:07,476
- Well, she's definitely aged.
- How can you still be hungry? We just...

552
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,252
I'd put her biological age
somewhere between 12 and 13,

553
00:36:10,336 --> 00:36:13,297
and she turned six
two weeks ago on Tuesday.

554
00:36:13,381 --> 00:36:14,465
What?

555
00:36:15,675 --> 00:36:17,093
We're older?

556
00:36:18,386 --> 00:36:19,804
Am I okay?

557
00:36:21,055 --> 00:36:23,891
I don't know what's happening
to the three of you, sweetheart.

558
00:36:23,974 --> 00:36:26,268
But for now,
I have another swimsuit in my bag,

559
00:36:26,352 --> 00:36:28,813
and maybe you should change into that.

560
00:36:29,772 --> 00:36:31,440
It might be a virus, maybe.

561
00:36:31,524 --> 00:36:33,150
Could be mosquitoes where...

562
00:36:33,234 --> 00:36:35,319
The way they behave
on this part of the island.

563
00:36:35,403 --> 00:36:37,905
Something's happening to her
that's triggering her hormones.

564
00:36:37,988 --> 00:36:39,407
The dog has died!

565
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:41,075
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

566
00:36:42,243 --> 00:36:43,744
He was only just alive.

567
00:36:43,828 --> 00:36:46,163
- Kara, hold on to me, baby.
- What's happening?

568
00:36:47,415 --> 00:36:49,625
Who thinks they can swim

569
00:36:49,709 --> 00:36:53,212
a hundred lengths of a pool
against currents,

570
00:36:53,295 --> 00:36:56,966
and then turn and swim
an unknown amount along the coast

571
00:36:57,049 --> 00:36:58,467
till we find another shore?

572
00:36:59,176 --> 00:37:03,931
That's what I'm guessing the distance is
to swim out and get around this cove.

573
00:37:15,443 --> 00:37:18,738
It looks too far. Babe, it's not safe.

574
00:37:19,947 --> 00:37:21,532
My name is Brendon.

575
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:23,325
I went to private school.

576
00:37:23,409 --> 00:37:26,078
My mom is an attorney,
and my dad is a dentist.

577
00:37:26,996 --> 00:37:29,874
- Yo, I just wanted somebody to know that.
- Okay.

578
00:37:29,957 --> 00:37:33,210
I have a problem with my blood.
A rare issue with its clotting.

579
00:37:33,294 --> 00:37:36,172
I came to this island to see the ocean

580
00:37:36,255 --> 00:37:39,717
and remember I'm connected
to something bigger.

581
00:37:40,342 --> 00:37:42,344
That's beautiful, Brendon.

582
00:37:43,554 --> 00:37:46,557
I don't feel the same way
I felt yesterday or this morning,

583
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,018
and I don't think
my parents would understand.

584
00:37:50,019 --> 00:37:52,480
My thoughts have more colors in them now.

585
00:37:53,773 --> 00:37:56,734
Yesterday, I had a few colors
and they were really strong,

586
00:37:56,817 --> 00:37:59,904
and now I have more and they're quieter.

587
00:38:00,446 --> 00:38:01,572
Okay!

588
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,825
Everyone, gather!

589
00:38:04,909 --> 00:38:06,827
Come on, come on, come on!

590
00:38:06,911 --> 00:38:09,413
Everyone needs to have a voice here.

591
00:38:09,955 --> 00:38:11,749
Are you sure we have time for this?

592
00:38:11,832 --> 00:38:14,752
We will make destructive decisions
if we don't feel safe with each other.

593
00:38:14,835 --> 00:38:18,339
I know we don't have time,
but why don't we start with you two?

594
00:38:19,089 --> 00:38:20,466
Why are you here?

595
00:38:23,677 --> 00:38:26,096
- We've been having a tough time...
- Chrystal.

596
00:38:26,764 --> 00:38:28,432
We've been going through something.

597
00:38:28,516 --> 00:38:31,268
He's under a lot of stress as a doctor.
He needed some time away.

598
00:38:31,352 --> 00:38:33,187
Everyone does.
I'm not unusual in that.

599
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:35,815
Charles, it's okay.
I'm not gonna say anything else.

600
00:38:35,898 --> 00:38:38,609
Good! It's nice to hear from you both.

601
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:40,986
How about you guys?

602
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:46,408
Prisca?

603
00:38:46,492 --> 00:38:47,827
It's nothing.

604
00:38:48,494 --> 00:38:50,913
We just have to make a decision.

605
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:52,873
The kids are reacting to something.

606
00:38:52,957 --> 00:38:55,793
It's a virus. It's probably a virus.

607
00:38:56,919 --> 00:38:58,879
I just need to catch my breath.

608
00:38:58,963 --> 00:39:00,965
I just started feeling weird a minute ago.

609
00:39:01,048 --> 00:39:02,508
Are you okay, Mom?

610
00:39:02,591 --> 00:39:04,301
- Mom?
- What's wrong?

611
00:39:04,385 --> 00:39:05,469
Are you okay, Mom?

612
00:39:05,553 --> 00:39:07,429
I don't think it's the...

613
00:39:07,513 --> 00:39:09,306
- She has a tumor.
- What?

614
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:11,150
But it's benign.
They said it's benign.

615
00:39:11,225 --> 00:39:12,351
Oh, my God.

616
00:39:12,434 --> 00:39:13,602
Mom?

617
00:39:15,396 --> 00:39:17,314
Is it... Where?

618
00:39:17,398 --> 00:39:19,400
- Mom?
- It's okay.

619
00:39:19,483 --> 00:39:20,818
Can I...

620
00:39:20,901 --> 00:39:23,070
I can feel it.
It's the size of a golf ball.

621
00:39:23,153 --> 00:39:25,906
No, it's supposed to be
three centimeters.

622
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:27,825
All right. Let me see.

623
00:39:27,908 --> 00:39:29,618
- Whoa! Prisca!
- Mom!

624
00:39:29,702 --> 00:39:31,161
- She's gonna faint.
- Prisca.

625
00:39:31,245 --> 00:39:32,246
Mom.

626
00:39:32,329 --> 00:39:34,957
- Let her get some air!
- Wake up, Pris. Don't do this.

627
00:39:37,251 --> 00:39:38,544
It's there.

628
00:39:39,712 --> 00:39:42,047
It's been there for a while.
It's the size of a softball.

629
00:39:42,131 --> 00:39:43,257
Jesus.

630
00:39:44,091 --> 00:39:45,092
- It's grown.
- What?

631
00:39:45,175 --> 00:39:47,469
- What's happening to Mom?
- What's going on?

632
00:39:47,553 --> 00:39:49,847
- Dad! Dad, what's happening to Mom?
- It's okay.

633
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:53,517
Trent, why don't you two guys go play
somewhere else on the beach, okay? Okay?

634
00:39:53,601 --> 00:39:56,061
Mom's a little bit tired.
Would you do that for me, tiger?

635
00:39:56,145 --> 00:39:57,905
The first adult
is being affected.

636
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:59,106
What if we cut it out?

637
00:39:59,189 --> 00:40:00,749
- Dad!
- Not possible.

638
00:40:00,774 --> 00:40:03,068
Actually, it is. But it's Guy's call.

639
00:40:03,152 --> 00:40:04,904
No! No, no, no! No!

640
00:40:04,987 --> 00:40:07,406
I don't wanna make this decision.
No. No, I...

641
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:10,784
I don't know what to do.

642
00:40:16,165 --> 00:40:17,708
- Do we have alcohol?
- Yes.

643
00:40:17,791 --> 00:40:19,293
Some bottles from the minibar.

644
00:40:19,376 --> 00:40:21,378
I cannot be held responsible.
You understand?

645
00:40:21,462 --> 00:40:22,462
Yes.

646
00:40:23,422 --> 00:40:26,091
Okay. Well, does anyone
have a needle and thread?

647
00:40:26,175 --> 00:40:28,969
- We have to sew this up.
- Yeah, yeah. Uh...

648
00:40:29,053 --> 00:40:31,305
Here. Here. Is this the right decision?

649
00:40:31,388 --> 00:40:33,783
- Maybe we should all talk about this.
- I can't think.

650
00:40:33,807 --> 00:40:35,476
This tumor is going to kill her.

651
00:40:40,356 --> 00:40:44,443
Did you know that Jack Nicholson
did a film with Marlon Brando?

652
00:40:44,526 --> 00:40:45,527
Oh, no.

653
00:40:46,695 --> 00:40:47,863
What is he saying?

654
00:40:47,947 --> 00:40:50,282
- What was the name of that film?
- Charles, breathe.

655
00:40:50,366 --> 00:40:51,867
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

656
00:40:52,701 --> 00:40:55,287
- Will you let me do my job, please?
- Is he okay?

657
00:41:17,518 --> 00:41:18,519
Cut her again.

658
00:41:18,602 --> 00:41:21,063
We'll keep our hands in there
to keep the incision open.

659
00:41:21,146 --> 00:41:22,982
Guy, I can help, brother.

660
00:41:23,065 --> 00:41:24,733
No, I'll take care of her.

661
00:41:24,817 --> 00:41:26,377
Does anyone know the name of that film?

662
00:41:26,443 --> 00:41:30,614
It was with Jack Nicholson
and Marlon Brando.

663
00:41:31,573 --> 00:41:33,283
- Both.
- Try again, Doctor.

664
00:41:33,951 --> 00:41:37,997
Oblique incision on the side of the belly,
four to six inches. You can do this.

665
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:43,293
Put your fingers inside the incision.

666
00:41:43,377 --> 00:41:44,461
Okay.

667
00:41:44,545 --> 00:41:46,505
Can you open it
a little wider, please?

668
00:41:48,048 --> 00:41:49,341
It's closing around my fingers.

669
00:41:49,425 --> 00:41:52,094
Keep pulling it apart. That's it.

670
00:41:52,886 --> 00:41:54,388
I'm lifting the tumor out.

671
00:41:55,514 --> 00:41:58,350
Wow! It's the size of a cantaloupe!

672
00:41:58,434 --> 00:41:59,435
Wait!

673
00:42:00,352 --> 00:42:02,104
It's attached to something.

674
00:42:02,896 --> 00:42:04,231
- Muscle tissue.
- Okay.

675
00:42:04,314 --> 00:42:08,277
Could you hold the incision open
a little wider, if you would?

676
00:42:09,695 --> 00:42:10,863
I'm so sorry, Pris.

677
00:42:10,946 --> 00:42:13,574
Just cutting underneath the tumor.

678
00:42:15,159 --> 00:42:16,869
Okay. Got it.

679
00:42:29,548 --> 00:42:30,841
Mom.

680
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:34,595
Prisca?

681
00:42:35,804 --> 00:42:37,014
Mom?

682
00:42:53,739 --> 00:42:54,823
It's okay.

683
00:42:55,991 --> 00:42:57,326
I just fainted.

684
00:42:59,328 --> 00:43:01,080
We took the tumor out.

685
00:43:01,663 --> 00:43:03,040
It was going to kill you.

686
00:43:04,708 --> 00:43:07,711
Your husband made a fast decision.

687
00:43:19,223 --> 00:43:21,475
Guy, I feel better.

688
00:43:41,829 --> 00:43:42,830
Damn!

689
00:43:45,207 --> 00:43:46,834
Come on, y'all, look at this!

690
00:43:49,044 --> 00:43:50,212
Hurry!

691
00:43:53,132 --> 00:43:54,299
Damn.

692
00:43:55,676 --> 00:43:57,010
Come on, y'all!

693
00:44:05,936 --> 00:44:07,688
Can we all agree I didn't do that?

694
00:44:08,689 --> 00:44:09,857
What happened to her?

695
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:11,900
The body has decomposed.

696
00:44:12,484 --> 00:44:14,778
- How quickly can that happen?
- A long time.

697
00:44:14,862 --> 00:44:16,196
Mom knows this stuff.

698
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,532
I'm not a forensic pathologist,

699
00:44:18,615 --> 00:44:21,076
but from excavations for the museum,

700
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:24,371
I know that it varies
based on soil and temperature.

701
00:44:24,454 --> 00:44:27,374
My best guess, an exposed body,

702
00:44:27,457 --> 00:44:30,794
the flesh will be gone
in approximately seven years.

703
00:44:31,753 --> 00:44:33,714
And this happened in, what,
three hours?

704
00:44:33,797 --> 00:44:34,965
I know.

705
00:44:35,048 --> 00:44:38,635
And bones, we've found,
will disintegrate in 30 years more.

706
00:44:39,219 --> 00:44:40,679
What the hell, man?

707
00:44:40,762 --> 00:44:44,308
On this beach, less than 20 hours
after you die, you just return to dust.

708
00:44:45,642 --> 00:44:46,935
What exactly are we saying?

709
00:44:47,019 --> 00:44:49,062
Something is going on
with time on this beach.

710
00:44:49,688 --> 00:44:50,898
Time?

711
00:44:56,862 --> 00:44:58,113
You have wrinkles.

712
00:45:12,002 --> 00:45:13,670
I'm scared.

713
00:45:17,716 --> 00:45:23,180
It's best to focus on specifics
in the present in unsettling situations.

714
00:45:23,263 --> 00:45:25,766
- Mm-hmm.
- Like breathing.

715
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:28,727
What's happening to us?

716
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:31,480
Are we sick, too?

717
00:45:31,563 --> 00:45:32,773
No, I don't think so.

718
00:45:33,607 --> 00:45:34,983
I think we're just growing.

719
00:45:35,734 --> 00:45:37,778
Going by Trent and Maddox's ages

720
00:45:37,861 --> 00:45:39,696
and the time we spent on this beach,

721
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:44,618
half an hour is equivalent
to something like one year of our lives.

722
00:45:45,369 --> 00:45:48,413
This must be true for all of us,
we just don't see it on everyone.

723
00:45:49,122 --> 00:45:51,002
It's the first time
they wished they were Black.

724
00:45:51,083 --> 00:45:52,084
Mm-hmm.

725
00:45:52,167 --> 00:45:54,461
The kids are eating so much
because their mass is growing.

726
00:45:54,544 --> 00:45:58,507
They need to grow
an enormous amount of mass quickly.

727
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:00,676
We're staying roughly the same mass.

728
00:46:00,759 --> 00:46:02,594
Our cells are just aging.

729
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:04,554
I don't feel the same.

730
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:07,224
It's like my mind is changing, too.

731
00:46:08,183 --> 00:46:11,061
I'm getting many thoughts
at the same time.

732
00:46:12,229 --> 00:46:13,272
It's weird.

733
00:46:17,734 --> 00:46:20,279
I'm not as scared
about what's happening to us.

734
00:46:21,863 --> 00:46:23,383
What about our hair and nails?

735
00:46:24,032 --> 00:46:26,368
Shouldn't they be growing
at an abnormal rate?

736
00:46:26,451 --> 00:46:28,537
Maybe it has to do with
the fact that the cells

737
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:30,622
in hair and nails are dead,

738
00:46:30,706 --> 00:46:32,958
and they aren't reacting
in the same way.

739
00:46:33,041 --> 00:46:36,586
On this beach, 60 minutes is two years.

740
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:39,965
We'll age almost 50 years in one day here.

741
00:46:40,841 --> 00:46:42,050
Almost a lifetime.

742
00:46:46,346 --> 00:46:48,765
I think it could be the rock
that surrounds this beach.

743
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:52,811
If our cells are being affected,

744
00:46:52,894 --> 00:46:55,647
speeding up in their processes,

745
00:46:56,815 --> 00:47:01,445
then us trying to leave
is like swimming to the surface too fast

746
00:47:01,528 --> 00:47:02,988
after being deep in the ocean.

747
00:47:03,071 --> 00:47:05,490
Our bodies can't reacclimate.

748
00:47:06,158 --> 00:47:08,660
That's why we go unconscious
when we try to leave.

749
00:47:10,912 --> 00:47:16,376
Maybe we could slowly
walk through the canyon,

750
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:18,712
take a step, stand still.

751
00:47:19,713 --> 00:47:22,382
Do it over eight to ten hours.

752
00:47:23,633 --> 00:47:25,010
Let our bodies acclimate.

753
00:47:27,554 --> 00:47:29,806
But, according to Prisca's timeline,

754
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:32,351
who would be willing to give up
20 years of their life trying?

755
00:47:32,434 --> 00:47:33,560
I'm sorry, this is nonsense.

756
00:47:33,643 --> 00:47:36,188
Let's not shut down everyone's experience.

757
00:47:37,647 --> 00:47:39,066
Wait. Where are the kids?

758
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:44,071
Trent!

759
00:47:44,613 --> 00:47:45,614
Kara!

760
00:47:46,198 --> 00:47:49,284
Answer us now! We need you here!

761
00:47:49,368 --> 00:47:50,577
There they are.

762
00:48:05,133 --> 00:48:07,761
- Want some?
- No, I'm not hungry.

763
00:48:24,986 --> 00:48:26,279
Hey.

764
00:48:26,363 --> 00:48:27,781
Mom! Dad!

765
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:46,425
Kara.

766
00:48:47,384 --> 00:48:50,137
- What did you do?
- We were just playing.

767
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:52,431
It's okay. I just got a little fat.

768
00:48:52,514 --> 00:48:53,682
Mom, you're better.

769
00:48:55,851 --> 00:48:56,971
Maddox?

770
00:48:58,186 --> 00:49:00,230
- Maddox?
- It's okay, Trent.

771
00:49:01,231 --> 00:49:03,900
Just let Mom and Dad figure this out.

772
00:49:06,736 --> 00:49:07,988
My God, Guy.

773
00:49:09,823 --> 00:49:11,116
It's okay, right, Mom?

774
00:49:11,908 --> 00:49:17,247
Jack Nicholson and Marlon Brando
were in a movie together.

775
00:49:18,123 --> 00:49:23,003
If she walked into the emergency room,
I'd say she's about five months pregnant.

776
00:49:23,086 --> 00:49:24,796
- What?
- What?

777
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,965
Just stay calm, Trent.

778
00:49:27,048 --> 00:49:30,552
She'll only be pregnant for about
20 minutes from the time of conception.

779
00:49:30,635 --> 00:49:33,680
Why do you keep looking at me
like you wanna steal my wallet?

780
00:49:33,763 --> 00:49:36,243
- Do you want me to punch you in the face?
- Calm down.

781
00:49:36,308 --> 00:49:38,908
- I have no idea what you're talking about.
- All right.

782
00:49:38,935 --> 00:49:42,814
Let's just concentrate
on the issue at hand.

783
00:49:42,898 --> 00:49:44,191
Do you know about movies?

784
00:49:44,274 --> 00:49:46,526
Dad, Mom tells you to sit down
when you get like this.

785
00:49:46,610 --> 00:49:49,196
Hey. We need to get her help. Okay?

786
00:49:49,279 --> 00:49:51,781
- This cannot happen here.
- It's gotten bigger.

787
00:49:51,865 --> 00:49:54,451
- Kara? It's Kara, right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

788
00:49:54,534 --> 00:49:55,577
Lay down on a blanket.

789
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:58,747
It's gonna be okay. There's
a lot of people here that can help you.

790
00:49:58,830 --> 00:50:00,123
We're all like your family now.

791
00:50:00,207 --> 00:50:01,500
Oh, God.

792
00:50:01,583 --> 00:50:02,584
Ohh.

793
00:50:02,667 --> 00:50:04,586
Our cells are aging very fast here.

794
00:50:04,669 --> 00:50:07,047
Something to do with the rocks
around the beach, we think.

795
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:08,757
Just lay down on the sand, okay?

796
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:12,052
Whatever would have happened to us
is happening to us really fast, okay?

797
00:50:12,135 --> 00:50:13,136
I know.

798
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:14,930
What you did is how babies are made.

799
00:50:15,013 --> 00:50:17,853
I know, but I thought you had
to do that ten times or something.

800
00:50:17,933 --> 00:50:20,536
- Take deep breaths. I'll breathe with you.
- Did I get that wrong?

801
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,896
- Baby, come on.
- It can happen after only once.

802
00:50:24,105 --> 00:50:26,399
We didn't get a chance
to talk about all this.

803
00:50:26,483 --> 00:50:29,528
- Are Trent and I having a baby?
- Did I get it wrong?

804
00:50:29,611 --> 00:50:31,780
Only a couple of minutes left
if we're right.

805
00:50:32,322 --> 00:50:34,908
- Is that the baby? Mom.
- You got it. Okay.

806
00:50:34,991 --> 00:50:36,409
- Charles!
- Kara?

807
00:50:36,493 --> 00:50:38,411
I need to think
about what to do.

808
00:50:38,495 --> 00:50:40,872
No! I need to help her.

809
00:50:40,956 --> 00:50:43,333
- Mom! I'm scared!
- It's okay.

810
00:50:43,416 --> 00:50:45,418
- Kara, wait. Stay with me.
- I'm here, baby.

811
00:50:45,502 --> 00:50:46,896
- Stay with me.
- Just take my hand.

812
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,421
Come on. Baby, can you hold her hand?

813
00:50:48,505 --> 00:50:50,799
I've decided I'm gonna marry her.

814
00:50:50,882 --> 00:50:54,094
And we are never gonna yell at each other
and we are never getting divorced!

815
00:50:54,177 --> 00:50:58,014
Trent, listen to me.
She's going to feel pain. Intense pain.

816
00:50:58,098 --> 00:51:00,058
Okay? Like she never felt before.

817
00:51:00,141 --> 00:51:03,770
But then it's going to pass. Okay?
It's going to pass.

818
00:51:03,853 --> 00:51:05,647
- You did it, girl!
- Mom!

819
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:07,274
- All right.
- Chrystal.

820
00:51:09,025 --> 00:51:10,110
Chrystal!

821
00:51:11,945 --> 00:51:15,282
Hey, you blacked out.
You can't go that way.

822
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:18,952
Come on. You're okay now.
Come on.

823
00:51:19,035 --> 00:51:21,246
Get up. Get up.

824
00:51:21,329 --> 00:51:22,581
- Come here.
- No.

825
00:51:23,498 --> 00:51:24,499
Look.

826
00:51:30,088 --> 00:51:31,923
You're okay. Come on. Come on.

827
00:51:32,549 --> 00:51:34,843
- Babies crying helps them breathe.
- It's here.

828
00:51:34,926 --> 00:51:36,469
We looked that up. Remember, Mom?

829
00:51:40,557 --> 00:51:41,558
You see?

830
00:51:48,189 --> 00:51:50,233
We put him on the towel
to clean him up.

831
00:51:50,317 --> 00:51:54,237
He looked around and closed his eyes.

832
00:51:54,321 --> 00:51:56,740
We had him on the towel for one minute.

833
00:51:57,324 --> 00:51:59,200
He died from lack of attention.

834
00:51:59,284 --> 00:52:02,245
Things are moving
too fast here for a baby to survive.

835
00:52:03,163 --> 00:52:05,165
No. No, you're lying.

836
00:52:05,248 --> 00:52:07,667
You're lying! You're all lying!
You're lying!

837
00:52:07,751 --> 00:52:08,752
Shut up, Trent.

838
00:52:08,835 --> 00:52:11,004
- Hey. Hey!
- You're lying!

839
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:16,259
Maybe we should all talk
about what just happened.

840
00:52:19,429 --> 00:52:22,474
Charles, get us out of here!

841
00:52:23,141 --> 00:52:26,811
Get us out of here now!
You were supposed to protect us!

842
00:52:26,895 --> 00:52:28,980
You didn't protect us.

843
00:52:29,064 --> 00:52:30,565
Kara's hurt!

844
00:52:31,566 --> 00:52:34,986
I will make these decisions.
Just give me a second.

845
00:52:40,533 --> 00:52:43,328
I used to see you in our neighborhood.
Who are you?

846
00:52:45,246 --> 00:52:46,665
I'm Jarin!

847
00:52:48,917 --> 00:52:50,669
I don't know where you live.

848
00:52:53,963 --> 00:52:55,382
Don't condescend to me.

849
00:52:58,885 --> 00:53:00,553
Put some makeup on your face.

850
00:53:20,156 --> 00:53:22,200
I'm sorry about the baby.

851
00:53:24,452 --> 00:53:27,122
When I was your age,
I was in love with a man.

852
00:53:29,624 --> 00:53:31,042
His name was Giuseppe.

853
00:53:32,919 --> 00:53:35,338
He wasn't very handsome,
and I left him.

854
00:53:37,257 --> 00:53:39,092
We looked silly together, he and I.

855
00:53:49,519 --> 00:53:51,020
He had nothing to offer.

856
00:53:54,524 --> 00:53:56,943
For some reason,
I think about him a lot here.

857
00:54:08,037 --> 00:54:09,247
Leave me alone.

858
00:54:21,718 --> 00:54:24,804
- No, Charles!
- Stop!

859
00:54:25,388 --> 00:54:26,598
Stop!

860
00:54:37,192 --> 00:54:39,235
He's gone.

861
00:54:39,319 --> 00:54:40,820
Oh, God.

862
00:55:04,803 --> 00:55:07,347
I'm just going to take it.

863
00:55:12,101 --> 00:55:14,354
- Now...
- It's okay.

864
00:55:15,188 --> 00:55:16,856
Everything will be okay.

865
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,753
I'll find another beach
and I'll try to find help.

866
00:55:39,587 --> 00:55:40,922
She needs her medicine.

867
00:55:41,589 --> 00:55:43,341
We're lucky she hasn't had a seizure yet.

868
00:55:43,424 --> 00:55:45,927
It must be the beach.
Whatever it's doing to my body.

869
00:55:47,428 --> 00:55:49,848
Guy, I was on the swim team. I'll make it.

870
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:53,101
I'll make it.

871
00:56:00,191 --> 00:56:01,442
Watch him.

872
00:56:18,710 --> 00:56:20,378
Maybe I could climb that rock.

873
00:56:22,088 --> 00:56:25,800
Maybe the effect, the blacking out,
doesn't happen if you go up.

874
00:56:26,759 --> 00:56:27,886
You can't do it.

875
00:56:29,053 --> 00:56:31,139
- I'll do it.
- Yeah, he's strong. He can do it.

876
00:56:31,222 --> 00:56:32,807
- Yeah.
- No.

877
00:56:32,891 --> 00:56:34,726
I won't allow my son to do that.

878
00:56:34,809 --> 00:56:36,644
Prisca's right.
It's too dangerous.

879
00:56:36,728 --> 00:56:38,062
It's a last resort.

880
00:56:38,938 --> 00:56:39,939
Mum...

881
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:44,611
I do feel... overwhelmed.

882
00:56:45,612 --> 00:56:49,490
I'm managing, but no one must know.

883
00:56:52,243 --> 00:56:54,078
They'll try to stop me from working.

884
00:56:55,455 --> 00:56:56,623
What should I do?

885
00:56:58,082 --> 00:57:00,084
Mum, tell me what to do.

886
00:57:02,587 --> 00:57:05,548
Prisca,
something's bothering me.

887
00:57:06,341 --> 00:57:08,760
Charles's family knew he had
some kind of mental disorder.

888
00:57:09,344 --> 00:57:11,346
Someone in each group was sick.

889
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:14,182
How did you first hear about this place?

890
00:57:14,265 --> 00:57:16,768
I don't know. I fell upon it.

891
00:57:16,851 --> 00:57:20,438
A random sweepstakes.
It came with a receipt at the pharmacy.

892
00:57:20,521 --> 00:57:23,358
I just followed it up online,
started getting emails.

893
00:57:23,441 --> 00:57:25,193
They know
our medical condition.

894
00:57:25,276 --> 00:57:26,444
They chose us.

895
00:57:27,445 --> 00:57:30,114
They have our passports.
We could just disappear.

896
00:57:30,782 --> 00:57:33,242
They sent us a special car to the airport.

897
00:57:33,326 --> 00:57:34,327
A plane.

898
00:57:34,869 --> 00:57:38,122
They can make it look
like we never left the house.

899
00:57:53,304 --> 00:57:55,598
You were thinking
about leaving Dad.

900
00:57:57,558 --> 00:57:58,893
Weren't you?

901
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:06,442
Yes.

902
00:58:08,403 --> 00:58:10,530
I didn't want you two to suffer.

903
00:58:14,742 --> 00:58:16,244
Was there someone else?

904
00:58:27,797 --> 00:58:29,173
Did Dad know?

905
00:58:40,935 --> 00:58:42,061
Maddox.

906
00:58:43,312 --> 00:58:44,480
Please.

907
00:58:45,690 --> 00:58:50,111
I found out about this tumor
and I got scared.

908
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:54,532
I stare at the remains
of nameless people in glass cases

909
00:58:54,615 --> 00:58:57,744
and I kept thinking
I'm going to be one of those people.

910
00:58:57,827 --> 00:58:59,037
Does that make any sense?

911
00:59:00,997 --> 00:59:04,542
I feel different than I felt yesterday.

912
00:59:06,502 --> 00:59:10,339
What I did feels like an illusion,
I swear.

913
00:59:13,134 --> 00:59:14,677
You hate me now.

914
00:59:16,971 --> 00:59:19,515
I just need some time, Mom.

915
00:59:25,146 --> 00:59:27,148
We don't have that, baby.

916
00:59:29,901 --> 00:59:31,444
Look at you.

917
00:59:34,572 --> 00:59:36,199
You're an adult.

918
00:59:39,118 --> 00:59:41,287
Be strong for everyone.

919
00:59:46,125 --> 00:59:48,169
Connect to something bigger.

920
01:00:47,979 --> 01:00:50,773
Here, here, hold on.
Lay him down, lay him down.

921
01:01:14,672 --> 01:01:16,716
He must have gone unconscious swimming.

922
01:01:19,302 --> 01:01:21,679
Brendon didn't do anything to that woman.

923
01:01:22,763 --> 01:01:24,640
We can't swim out, Prisca.

924
01:01:34,317 --> 01:01:36,235
We're not getting off this beach.

925
01:01:38,070 --> 01:01:43,284
We never had a prom,
or a graduation.

926
01:01:43,367 --> 01:01:45,786
There are so many memories we didn't have.

927
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:49,498
It's not fair.

928
01:01:54,253 --> 01:01:56,088
He needs to rest now.

929
01:02:31,958 --> 01:02:32,959
Kara!

930
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:36,671
Kara!

931
01:02:38,589 --> 01:02:40,132
Wait. What if you get dizzy up there?

932
01:02:40,216 --> 01:02:42,760
- You might black out.
- Trent, we're in charge now.

933
01:02:42,843 --> 01:02:44,303
My dad could hurt more people.

934
01:02:44,387 --> 01:02:46,430
I have to get him off this beach.

935
01:02:46,514 --> 01:02:48,307
Kara! Don't climb that.

936
01:02:48,391 --> 01:02:51,060
Come down! We'll find another way.

937
01:02:52,061 --> 01:02:53,396
No! Don't! Trent!

938
01:02:53,479 --> 01:02:55,760
- Listen to Mom.
- I have to go with her!

939
01:02:55,815 --> 01:02:58,818
Kara, wait! Don't climb.
Let me get your mother.

940
01:02:58,901 --> 01:03:01,028
- Kara!
- That's not the way.

941
01:03:01,112 --> 01:03:03,656
She's panicked and desperate.
Talk to each other.

942
01:03:03,739 --> 01:03:06,909
Kara, you and I
should just stay together.

943
01:03:06,993 --> 01:03:09,370
What if we spend this whole time
trying to get out of here

944
01:03:09,453 --> 01:03:10,579
and we still don't make it?

945
01:03:12,707 --> 01:03:14,583
It'll be too short if we don't try.

946
01:03:14,667 --> 01:03:16,168
No, Kara, please!

947
01:03:16,252 --> 01:03:18,296
Please just stay with me, please!

948
01:03:33,686 --> 01:03:36,230
If she makes it to the ledge,
she might have a chance.

949
01:03:38,107 --> 01:03:39,692
Go to the ledge and rest!

950
01:03:43,612 --> 01:03:44,697
Oh, shit.

951
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:46,324
There has to be a way out.

952
01:03:47,074 --> 01:03:49,827
It's a mathematical certainty.
There must be a way out.

953
01:04:01,297 --> 01:04:03,007
No. Why is she stopping?

954
01:04:03,090 --> 01:04:04,216
No.

955
01:04:05,843 --> 01:04:06,886
No, Kara.

956
01:04:06,969 --> 01:04:08,220
Kara, wake up!

957
01:04:08,304 --> 01:04:11,265
Kara, wake up! Wake up!

958
01:04:14,643 --> 01:04:15,978
Oh!

959
01:04:55,601 --> 01:04:56,602
Kara?

960
01:05:02,775 --> 01:05:03,776
Daddy...

961
01:05:23,212 --> 01:05:24,922
Let's all stay together.

962
01:05:25,631 --> 01:05:27,800
Nobody in this family goes alone anywhere.

963
01:05:30,761 --> 01:05:34,849
I think I figured it out.
I'm using these to swim out.

964
01:05:39,061 --> 01:05:40,521
I have a sister.

965
01:05:41,147 --> 01:05:43,983
She's a therapist, too.
I need to get to my sister.

966
01:05:44,608 --> 01:05:46,777
We never talk.
We had a fight a long time ago.

967
01:05:46,861 --> 01:05:50,156
She's older, but now I am.

968
01:05:51,407 --> 01:05:53,868
The fighting seems ridiculous now.

969
01:05:59,707 --> 01:06:00,708
Patricia.

970
01:06:01,292 --> 01:06:02,293
Patricia.

971
01:06:03,794 --> 01:06:05,087
No.

972
01:06:06,422 --> 01:06:08,048
What's happening to her?

973
01:06:08,132 --> 01:06:09,925
She was fine. What's happening?

974
01:06:10,009 --> 01:06:12,303
She keeps stopping
and starting.

975
01:06:16,849 --> 01:06:18,225
Dad, do something.

976
01:06:31,155 --> 01:06:32,156
No.

977
01:07:07,942 --> 01:07:09,193
Oh, no.

978
01:07:11,403 --> 01:07:12,613
Kara?

979
01:07:14,865 --> 01:07:17,326
Kara, where are you?

980
01:07:21,038 --> 01:07:24,124
Somebody's done this to us, Kara.

981
01:07:27,086 --> 01:07:29,547
I can't protect you anymore.

982
01:07:30,381 --> 01:07:32,216
Kara!

983
01:07:42,977 --> 01:07:45,271
No, you don't know.
Jarin went in a different way.

984
01:07:45,354 --> 01:07:47,606
He went...
And I'm a better swimmer than he is.

985
01:07:47,690 --> 01:07:50,025
He's older than me.
I could probably swim left...

986
01:07:50,109 --> 01:07:52,778
Trent, stop it. No. No.

987
01:07:52,861 --> 01:07:55,048
- No, you're not a better swimmer.
- Let me try.

988
01:07:55,072 --> 01:07:57,392
- You're not even gonna let me try.
- Listen. Listen.

989
01:07:57,449 --> 01:07:58,450
Listen.

990
01:08:12,339 --> 01:08:15,277
- ...then I can get on the rock.
- We're not gonna let you.

991
01:08:15,301 --> 01:08:16,885
Stop. It won't work.

992
01:08:16,969 --> 01:08:19,388
I don't wanna give up.
I really don't wanna give up.

993
01:08:19,471 --> 01:08:21,533
- We're not giving up.
- If you let me try...

994
01:08:39,408 --> 01:08:40,492
My back.

995
01:08:41,076 --> 01:08:42,911
I need my calcium.

996
01:08:42,995 --> 01:08:44,079
Chrystal?

997
01:08:44,788 --> 01:08:46,749
Chrystal, stay with us.

998
01:08:47,291 --> 01:08:48,792
Don't look at me.

999
01:09:06,894 --> 01:09:10,022
Prisca, I have to tell you something.

1000
01:09:15,569 --> 01:09:17,655
I saw your text messages one day.

1001
01:09:22,951 --> 01:09:24,578
He says romantic things.

1002
01:09:31,460 --> 01:09:32,753
I'm sorry.

1003
01:09:37,174 --> 01:09:41,220
I don't know who I would have been
okay with. But with that guy?

1004
01:09:44,890 --> 01:09:48,352
He's a joke, he's a pretend person.

1005
01:09:49,186 --> 01:09:51,522
You deserve someone
so much better than that.

1006
01:09:54,525 --> 01:09:56,318
I should have said something
when I saw it.

1007
01:09:56,402 --> 01:09:59,071
I hide from everything.
I'm a fucking coward.

1008
01:09:59,154 --> 01:10:02,157
This was no one's responsibility but me.

1009
01:10:03,075 --> 01:10:05,869
Your anger should be
aimed at me, just me.

1010
01:10:13,961 --> 01:10:17,881
There's no place I want to be
but with you.

1011
01:10:20,259 --> 01:10:21,677
Do you believe me?

1012
01:10:24,263 --> 01:10:25,889
I want to be here...

1013
01:10:30,310 --> 01:10:31,729
right now.

1014
01:10:52,499 --> 01:10:53,834
It's notebooks.

1015
01:10:58,255 --> 01:11:01,925
Well, maybe we can use some
of the empty pages for the fire,

1016
01:11:02,009 --> 01:11:03,510
keep Mom and Dad warm.

1017
01:11:08,098 --> 01:11:10,517
Whoever it was wanted
to be a science-fiction writer.

1018
01:11:10,601 --> 01:11:12,019
It's full of story ideas.

1019
01:11:13,645 --> 01:11:16,774
"Birds that can make you black out
when they scream,

1020
01:11:16,857 --> 01:11:20,277
fly too close to an Emirates
commercial plane one day."

1021
01:11:21,779 --> 01:11:24,573
He realized he was never getting off
this beach.

1022
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:28,952
He was trying to figure out
what's going on.

1023
01:11:32,790 --> 01:11:35,959
"Magnetism of this exact spot on the Earth

1024
01:11:36,043 --> 01:11:37,961
with the rocks on this beach,

1025
01:11:38,045 --> 01:11:41,173
submerged beneath the ocean
for millions of years,

1026
01:11:41,256 --> 01:11:43,300
deposited with special minerals,

1027
01:11:43,383 --> 01:11:46,762
are causing our cells
to age at a rapid rate.

1028
01:11:47,304 --> 01:11:49,515
Are there other places like this?

1029
01:11:50,557 --> 01:11:52,059
Who found this place?"

1030
01:11:53,393 --> 01:11:57,147
Maybe we can make a metal tube
that we can get in

1031
01:11:57,231 --> 01:11:59,066
that stops the effects on our cells.

1032
01:11:59,650 --> 01:12:03,278
Like at a dentist's office when they put
a metal vest on us before an X-ray.

1033
01:12:03,904 --> 01:12:06,907
I mean, then we could just walk out
with it on us and...

1034
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:11,078
We'll get dizzy at first, but slowly we'll
get used to it and we can leave, right?

1035
01:12:13,163 --> 01:12:15,165
Where are we gonna make a metal tube?

1036
01:12:17,084 --> 01:12:19,564
He wrote down a list of
all the names and the addresses

1037
01:12:19,628 --> 01:12:21,171
of the people with him on the beach.

1038
01:12:30,305 --> 01:12:32,224
Maddox, that's a camera.

1039
01:12:35,143 --> 01:12:36,478
They're recording us.

1040
01:12:39,439 --> 01:12:41,191
Why would they do this?

1041
01:13:18,729 --> 01:13:20,022
Oh, no.

1042
01:13:20,105 --> 01:13:21,315
Who is that?

1043
01:13:22,107 --> 01:13:23,442
Prisca, who is that?

1044
01:13:31,783 --> 01:13:33,493
You're gonna tell them what I did.

1045
01:13:34,494 --> 01:13:37,539
The man with the tattoos,

1046
01:13:38,165 --> 01:13:41,960
he was gonna steal things from my home.

1047
01:13:47,090 --> 01:13:48,216
Guy!

1048
01:13:49,176 --> 01:13:50,469
- Aah!
- No!

1049
01:13:50,552 --> 01:13:52,471
I can't let you tell them.

1050
01:13:52,554 --> 01:13:53,847
I'm a good doctor.

1051
01:13:53,931 --> 01:13:57,017
He was gonna follow us,
he was gonna steal things from our home.

1052
01:13:57,100 --> 01:13:58,310
Why don't you believe me?

1053
01:13:59,603 --> 01:14:00,604
I stopped him.

1054
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:05,275
Tell me where the knife is, Prisca!

1055
01:14:08,236 --> 01:14:11,114
I keep having these thoughts.

1056
01:14:11,698 --> 01:14:13,533
Listen, they keep coming to me.

1057
01:14:14,368 --> 01:14:15,702
Don't tell anyone.

1058
01:14:20,582 --> 01:14:23,460
Prisca, hide the kids!
I'll protect you!

1059
01:14:28,632 --> 01:14:29,925
Yes.

1060
01:14:30,008 --> 01:14:31,176
Maddox!

1061
01:14:31,259 --> 01:14:32,469
Trent!

1062
01:14:32,552 --> 01:14:36,181
I need you two to go
and find somewhere to hide now!

1063
01:14:36,264 --> 01:14:39,059
Somewhere where someone can't find you.
I need you to go right now!

1064
01:14:39,142 --> 01:14:41,395
- Mom, what? Wait.
- And don't ask any questions!

1065
01:14:41,478 --> 01:14:43,230
Now, go! Hide!

1066
01:14:44,856 --> 01:14:46,108
Go!

1067
01:14:57,577 --> 01:14:58,578
Shh.

1068
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:02,457
There's someone in here with us.

1069
01:15:07,671 --> 01:15:09,965
My body hurts to move.

1070
01:15:11,675 --> 01:15:13,468
I miss Giuseppe.

1071
01:15:14,845 --> 01:15:15,887
Don't look at me!

1072
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:18,265
Turn off the light!

1073
01:15:21,852 --> 01:15:24,229
I don't wanna be seen!

1074
01:15:24,312 --> 01:15:25,313
Argh.

1075
01:15:27,774 --> 01:15:29,860
Kara's dead, isn't she?

1076
01:15:30,652 --> 01:15:33,864
Whoever did this killed her, didn't they?

1077
01:15:35,407 --> 01:15:36,575
Kara died.

1078
01:15:38,952 --> 01:15:40,287
But it was an accident.

1079
01:15:53,008 --> 01:15:54,468
Aah!

1080
01:16:06,313 --> 01:16:09,066
Don't look!

1081
01:16:09,691 --> 01:16:11,568
God, it's already healed
in the wrong position.

1082
01:16:11,651 --> 01:16:13,528
Turn off the light!

1083
01:16:16,823 --> 01:16:18,200
Turn the light off.

1084
01:16:18,283 --> 01:16:22,454
I'm chief medical officer of my hospital!

1085
01:16:22,537 --> 01:16:24,456
I am not gonna let you

1086
01:16:24,998 --> 01:16:26,708
take it away from me!

1087
01:16:29,878 --> 01:16:32,172
Argh.

1088
01:17:26,017 --> 01:17:27,269
It's rust.

1089
01:17:28,937 --> 01:17:31,815
It acts like poison
when it gets into your bloodstream.

1090
01:17:55,797 --> 01:17:57,841
I'm sorry you were on this beach.

1091
01:17:59,885 --> 01:18:01,469
But this is my family.

1092
01:19:10,121 --> 01:19:12,916
Dad, Mom,
you guys gotta stay hydrated.

1093
01:19:14,876 --> 01:19:16,127
Mom.

1094
01:19:16,878 --> 01:19:17,921
Mom.

1095
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:20,548

Were we fighting about something?

1106
01:20:29,159 --> 01:20:30,243
We were.

1107
01:20:33,371 --> 01:20:37,334
Well, whatever it was,
I'm not mad anymore.

1108
01:20:45,383 --> 01:20:46,968
I can't remember.

1109
01:20:51,806 --> 01:20:54,684
Why did we want
to leave this beach?

1110
01:21:00,774 --> 01:21:02,025
So beautiful.

1111
01:21:06,654 --> 01:21:08,323
It doesn't matter.

1112
01:21:15,288 --> 01:21:16,664
It's funny.

1113
01:21:19,042 --> 01:21:21,753
I forget...

1114
01:21:23,797 --> 01:21:25,173
the word.

1115
01:21:28,343 --> 01:21:30,512
It's about my feelings for you.

1116
01:21:34,391 --> 01:21:35,767
I know.

1117
01:21:57,622 --> 01:21:58,873
- Dad?
- Dad.

1118
01:22:53,928 --> 01:22:54,971
Mom?

1119
01:22:59,350 --> 01:23:00,560
Oh, Mom.

1120
01:24:33,528 --> 01:24:37,657
We have about 13 hours left,
do you think?

1121
01:24:46,249 --> 01:24:47,375
Hmm.

1122
01:24:50,044 --> 01:24:53,256
We just got three days older
while you held my face.

1123
01:24:59,512 --> 01:25:01,431
Should we keep trying to get out?

1124
01:25:05,184 --> 01:25:06,352
I guess so.

1125
01:25:11,441 --> 01:25:13,568
Wanna make a sandcastle first?

1126
01:25:39,093 --> 01:25:43,181
I wonder if everybody
continues to feel like a kid

1127
01:25:43,264 --> 01:25:44,557
when they're our age or...

1128
01:25:45,808 --> 01:25:48,311
is it because we were kids yesterday?

1129
01:25:50,188 --> 01:25:52,815
Idlib sent me a message
I never decoded.

1130
01:25:53,608 --> 01:25:56,235
Yeah, we thought we were so smart.

1131
01:25:58,821 --> 01:25:59,947
Decode it.

1132
01:26:22,053 --> 01:26:23,846
Each symbol means a letter.

1133
01:26:25,807 --> 01:26:27,558
We thought we were like spies.

1134
01:26:37,026 --> 01:26:38,569
What was the big message?

1135
01:26:50,456 --> 01:26:51,624
What's it say?

1136
01:27:09,934 --> 01:27:13,020
The coral might protect us
from the effects of the rocks.

1137
01:27:13,688 --> 01:27:16,649
Maybe that's like our metal tube.

1138
01:27:16,733 --> 01:27:18,943
Maybe we're just making up
what we want to hear.

1139
01:27:19,026 --> 01:27:21,320
Maybe he heard
they took people to this beach.

1140
01:27:21,863 --> 01:27:23,781
Idlib heard something he shouldn't have.

1141
01:27:24,615 --> 01:27:27,452
He has no idea what it means,
but he knows it's bad.

1142
01:27:30,663 --> 01:27:32,123
He's trying to help us.

1143
01:27:33,541 --> 01:27:34,584
Wait.

1144
01:27:35,293 --> 01:27:36,711
I need to get something.

1145
01:29:54,765 --> 01:29:55,808
Both of them drowned.

1146
01:29:57,727 --> 01:30:00,605
For a second, I thought
they were gonna get through the coral.

1147
01:30:00,688 --> 01:30:02,940
I don't know how they suddenly thought
about going there.

1148
01:30:03,024 --> 01:30:04,859
<i>Theo, are you sure
they didn't make it?</i>

1149
01:30:04,942 --> 01:30:06,193
<i>We can't have another incident.</i>

1150
01:30:06,277 --> 01:30:08,613
Sidney, relax.
I watched for a minute and a half.

1151
01:30:09,572 --> 01:30:12,658
And the person who got through last year
ended up drowning anyway.

1152
01:30:12,742 --> 01:30:13,784
We're fine.

1153
01:30:14,744 --> 01:30:17,496
Final members of Trial 73 are deceased.

1154
01:30:17,580 --> 01:30:19,206
Observations complete.

1155
01:30:19,999 --> 01:30:22,251
Bringing drives back, returning to base.

1156
01:31:41,288 --> 01:31:43,708
All rooms for this trial
have been cleared.

1157
01:31:43,791 --> 01:31:46,335
Uh, home computer devices
have been wiped.

1158
01:31:46,419 --> 01:31:48,754
Three home computers
still waiting to be scrubbed.

1159
01:31:56,887 --> 01:31:58,889
Hello. Uh...

1160
01:31:59,598 --> 01:32:03,144
a moment of silence
for the members of Trial 73.

1161
01:32:11,902 --> 01:32:12,945
Thank you.

1162
01:32:15,322 --> 01:32:18,367
Um... I'll try not to be dramatic.

1163
01:32:21,162 --> 01:32:23,080
Because of this beach,

1164
01:32:24,123 --> 01:32:27,460
we have been able to save
hundreds of thousands of lives

1165
01:32:27,543 --> 01:32:28,836
with new medicines.

1166
01:32:29,712 --> 01:32:32,631
Before we're done, it will be millions.

1167
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:39,305
As you know,
we do trials and fail constantly.

1168
01:32:42,016 --> 01:32:43,768
But not today.

1169
01:32:44,935 --> 01:32:46,103
Tell them, Sidney.

1170
01:32:49,982 --> 01:32:54,862
One of this cohort
was a woman with the epileptic seizures.

1171
01:32:55,613 --> 01:32:57,156
Her name was Patricia Carmichael.

1172
01:32:57,239 --> 01:32:59,992
She suffered debilitating seizures
her whole life.

1173
01:33:00,076 --> 01:33:01,577
Nothing could help her.

1174
01:33:02,286 --> 01:33:06,457
The medicine we gave her when she arrived
turned out to be the exact mixture.

1175
01:33:07,374 --> 01:33:10,544
She didn't have a seizure
for 8 hours and 17 minutes.

1176
01:33:12,296 --> 01:33:14,423
Sixteen and a half years.

1177
01:33:15,466 --> 01:33:17,760
We cured her of her epilepsy.

1178
01:33:18,344 --> 01:33:20,387
We'll now fast-track trials,

1179
01:33:20,471 --> 01:33:23,849
make that medicine
and share it with the whole world.

1180
01:33:24,475 --> 01:33:26,393
Every single person that needs it.

1181
01:33:31,357 --> 01:33:34,235
Nature made that beach exist for a reason.

1182
01:33:34,819 --> 01:33:37,738
Warren and Warren was meant to find it
on their research expedition.

1183
01:33:37,822 --> 01:33:42,159
We were meant to test medicines
in one day, instead of a lifetime.

1184
01:33:43,369 --> 01:33:46,122
Lots more work to be done, everyone.

1185
01:33:46,831 --> 01:33:50,501
Let's do what nature wanted us to do.

1186
01:33:58,467 --> 01:34:00,845
Mr. and Mrs. Brody will arrive
at 11:00 a.m.

1187
01:34:00,928 --> 01:34:02,847
with six non-targeted guests.

1188
01:34:02,930 --> 01:34:05,516
Joseph Brody has early-onset Parkinson's.

1189
01:34:06,684 --> 01:34:08,561
Florence Brody will be accompanying him.

1190
01:34:08,644 --> 01:34:10,980
I'm gonna be a broken record
about this, Nils.

1191
01:34:11,063 --> 01:34:13,566
We should separate
the pure medical subjects

1192
01:34:13,649 --> 01:34:15,317
from the mental illness subjects.

1193
01:34:15,401 --> 01:34:18,529
Our violent schizophrenic patient cost us
the data on our blood clot patient.

1194
01:34:18,612 --> 01:34:21,073
Sidney, I doubt we'll alter protocol
at this point,

1195
01:34:21,157 --> 01:34:25,578
but put it in a form
and submit it to Warren and Warren again.

1196
01:34:49,852 --> 01:34:50,853
How are you?

1197
01:34:53,647 --> 01:34:56,483
Those kids went home.
They don't matter.

1198
01:34:56,567 --> 01:34:58,569
I tell you which kids you can play with.

1199
01:34:58,652 --> 01:35:00,237
You have to trust me

1200
01:35:00,321 --> 01:35:03,282
and don't ask questions. Okay?

1201
01:35:04,366 --> 01:35:06,410
- Okay.
- Good.

1202
01:35:07,244 --> 01:35:08,787
Now, those kids are fine.

1203
01:35:08,871 --> 01:35:10,748
See, you can play with them.

1204
01:35:11,665 --> 01:35:13,250
- Okay.
- Good.

1205
01:35:30,935 --> 01:35:32,561
You're a police officer.

1206
01:35:35,397 --> 01:35:36,398
Yeah.

1207
01:35:55,501 --> 01:35:57,753
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Brody.

1208
01:35:57,836 --> 01:36:01,006
Welcome to our version of paradise.

1209
01:36:01,924 --> 01:36:03,342
Thank you.

1210
01:36:04,718 --> 01:36:06,637
- It's lovely.
- Thank you.

1211
01:36:07,263 --> 01:36:08,597
This is Madrid.

1212
01:36:09,181 --> 01:36:11,600
From your food and beverage preferences
that you selected,

1213
01:36:12,559 --> 01:36:14,812
we've made you cocktails to welcome you.

1214
01:36:16,522 --> 01:36:19,024
- Sorry.
- No worries, Mr. and Mrs. Brody.

1215
01:36:19,108 --> 01:36:20,901
We'll just make a new set.

1216
01:36:20,985 --> 01:36:22,486
It'll only take a few moments.

1217
01:36:22,569 --> 01:36:24,446
I wouldn't take
anything they give you.

1218
01:36:24,530 --> 01:36:26,198
They left us all to die.

1219
01:36:28,993 --> 01:36:31,245
My name is Trent Capa.

1220
01:36:31,912 --> 01:36:33,497
I'm Maddox Capa.

1221
01:36:39,545 --> 01:36:41,630
All three are missing persons?

1222
01:36:42,756 --> 01:36:44,883
Sending you the rest of the names now.

1223
01:36:50,639 --> 01:36:53,934
<i>Our parents
are Guy and Prisca Capa.</i>

1224
01:36:54,018 --> 01:36:57,896
<i>We live at 707 Pine Street,
Philadelphia, USA.</i>

1225
01:36:58,897 --> 01:37:02,151
<i>Also with us was Jarin Carmichael,
who was a nurse.</i>

1226
01:37:12,703 --> 01:37:15,122
Listen, we have to get security.
What's happening?

1227
01:37:15,205 --> 01:37:16,623
Are you listening to me?

1228
01:37:57,915 --> 01:38:00,250
Gentlemen. Hey, hey, hey!

1229
01:38:00,334 --> 01:38:03,045
Gentlemen, we have a problem.
We need your assistance immediately.

1230
01:38:03,128 --> 01:38:05,130
Two of our guests need your attention.

1231
01:38:05,214 --> 01:38:07,591
Please solve this problem, now.

1232
01:40:18,680 --> 01:40:20,240
They've arrested everybody here.

1233
01:40:21,308 --> 01:40:24,937
Subpoenas are being served at Warren
and Warren's headquarters this week.

1234
01:40:30,609 --> 01:40:32,110
Let's get them to the airport.

1235
01:40:32,861 --> 01:40:35,364
Your aunt will be waiting for you
when you land.

1236
01:40:35,447 --> 01:40:36,907
How's she handling things?

1237
01:40:37,908 --> 01:40:40,619
How would you feel
if a 50-year-old man called and told you

1238
01:40:40,702 --> 01:40:42,621
he was your six-year-old nephew?

1239
01:40:48,001 --> 01:40:49,211
We'll be okay.
