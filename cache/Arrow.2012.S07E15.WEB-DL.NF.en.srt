WEAPONIZING IT.

TO HEAR YOU SAY IT.

00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:49,707
I PRESS ONE BUTTON,

00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:51,458
THE WHOLE CITY COMES
TO MY RESCUE.

471
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:57,798
YEAH. NOT WITH THAT
CIRCA 2017 FIRST BUILD
SECURITY SYSTEM.

472
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,759
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY PEOPLE DON'T
JUST CLICK "UPDATE"

473
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,094
WHEN IT SAYS "UPDATE."

474
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:03,221
TRY AGAIN, JAMES.

475
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,431
I'M NOT TELLING
YOU ANYTHING.
YOU CAN'T TOUCH ME.

476
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:06,515
REALLY? COME HERE.

477
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:08,101
STOP! YOU'LL REGRET THIS.

478
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:09,977
NOT AS MUCH AS YOU.

479
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:13,147
NOW TELL ME WHAT YOU
KNOW ABOUT CHLORMETHINE.

480
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:14,607
GO TO HELL!

WRONG ANSWER.

WAIT. WAIT!

483
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:20,947
I'LL TELL YOU EVERYTHING.

484
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:23,323
I DID IT, OK? I'VE BEEN
USING CHLORMETHINE
TO MAKE THE BULLETS,

485
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:25,659
AND THEN I'VE BEEN SELLING
THEM TO RIVAL GANGS.

486
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:26,994
GOOD.

487

GOOD. JAMES MIDAS,
BY THE AUTHORITY
OF THE SCPD,

490
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,670
YOU ARE UNDER
ARREST. COME HERE.

491
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:43,469
AGAIN, JAMES, YOU HAVE
MY PERSONAL PROMISE.

492
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:46,305
THERE WILL BE CONSEQUENCES
FOR THIS EGREGIOUS MISTAKE.

493
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:47,932
I APPRECIATE THAT,
EMILY.

494
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:49,976
I USED TO HAVE SUCH
FAITH IN THE POLICE.

495
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:52,145
I'D HATE TO THINK

HAVE BECOME
NOTHING MORE

497
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:56,649
THAN A BUNCH OF
BULLYING THUGS.

498
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:03,072
SO YOU'RE JUST
CUTTING HIM LOOSE?

499
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:04,698
WE HAVE NO GROUNDS
TO HOLD HIM.

500
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,992
HE CONFESSED.

501
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,326
WHILE YOU WERE
DANGLING HIM

502
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:09,536
OVER A VAT OF
HYDROFLUORIC ACID.

503
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:10,871
OK, HE WAS NEVER IN
ANY DANGER.

504
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:12,290
YEAH, WELL, THAT'S
NOT HIS STORY.

505
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,666
YOU KNOW, INSTEAD OF
USING THIS CASE

506
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,209
TO WORK WITHIN THE
CONFINES OF THE LAW,

507
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:16,836
YOU ALL WENT ROGUE.

508
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:19,172
AND YOU,
YOU LET HIM.

509
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:22,758
IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO MAKE A CHOICE.

510
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,719
ARE YOU THE CAPTAIN
OR ARE YOU A VIGILANTE?

511
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:31,600
I'M THE CAPTAIN.

512
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:34,103
THEN START ACTING
LIKE IT.

513
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,741
I ASKED YOU TO BE
PATIENT.

IT WASN'T WORKING.

515

WELL, IT WOULD'VE.
I HAD A WARRANT.

516
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:52,412
IF YOU HAD LISTENED
TO ME,

517
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,372
WE COULD BE SEARCHING
MIDAS' HOUSE RIGHT NOW

518
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:56,792
INSTEAD OF BEING TOLD
TO STAY 5 MILES AWAY
FROM HIM.

COME HERE, MY LITTLE HAWK.

THANK YOU.

THE BED.

529

I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:51,513
I'M A WOMAN OF MY WORD.

531
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:55,268
AND I'M A MAN OF MINE.

532
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:57,435
THE NIGHT DIAZ DIED,

533
00:23:57,477 --> 00:24:00,856
I WAS SERVING ANOTHER

AFTER DELIVERING DINNER.

00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:06,862
SO WHEN I HEARD YELLING,

537
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:09,656
I GOT UP TO GET
A BETTER LOOK.

I'VE KNOW YOU
A LONG TIME, D,

WITH POLLARD.

AT ME,

BUT SOMETHING WENT WRONG.

559
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:07,714

I'M SORRY.

THING I HAVE LEFT.

BEING ON BOTH SIDES,

BECAUSE I AM...

MAKE YOU THE CANARY.

00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,331
WELL, DINAH, CRY OR NO CRY,
YOU ARE THE BLACK CANARY.

778
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:27,626
YOU PROVED THAT TONIGHT.

779
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:30,545
THANK YOU.

780
00:35:30,587 --> 00:35:31,922
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE
WE DID TONIGHT?

781
00:35:31,964 --> 00:35:34,299
WE FORCED POLLARD'S HAND.

782
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,593
I LEVERAGED HER
RELATIONSHIP WITH MIDAS

783
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:38,553
TO CONVINCE HER
TO SIGN OFF ON CREATING

784
00:35:38,595 --> 00:35:40,430
A SPECIAL
VIGILANTE TASK FORCE.

785
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:42,891
WE'RE STILL SANCTIONED
BY THE SCPD,

786
00:35:42,933 --> 00:35:44,726
BUT WE'RE OPERATING
AS OUR OWN UNIT

787
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:47,771
OUT OF THE BUNKER
IN OUR SUITS.

788
00:35:47,813 --> 00:35:49,355
AND THE ANTI-VIGILANTE LAW?

789
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:52,358
IT'S ON HER DESK FOR REPEAL.
SHE'S GONNA SIGN IT.

790
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,569
RENE: SO WE'RE
LIKE THE BLACK OPS
FOR THE SCPD NOW?

791
00:35:54,611 --> 00:35:56,029
THAT'S COOL.

792
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:57,572
JOHN: I'M JUST GLAD
WE'RE ALL BACK.

793
00:35:57,614 --> 00:35:58,740
IT FEELS RIGHT.

794
00:35:58,782 --> 00:36:00,117
I'LL SECOND
THAT.

795
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,910
IT'S NICE TO BE
PART OF A TEAM AGAIN.

796
00:36:01,952 --> 00:36:03,912
RENE: AND BE HERE
AT THE BUNKER...

797
00:36:03,954 --> 00:36:05,705
THE SWEET BUNKER.

798
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:08,708
DO YOU GUYS
FEEL LIKE HITTING UP
THE, UH, "SWEET" BAR?

799
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,085
FELICITY: YOU GUYS
GO AHEAD. I ATE SOMETHING

800
00:36:10,127 --> 00:36:11,252
THAT'S NOT GONNA
MIX WELL WITH ALCOHOL.

801
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:13,880
YEAH. I'M GONNA HANG
BACK, TOO, GUYS.

802
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:15,214
DINAH: OK.

803
00:36:19,052 --> 00:36:20,345
[EXHALES]

804
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:23,598
I GOT YOU
SOMETHING.

805
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,642
[DEADPANS]
GEE, YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE.

806
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:27,811
WELL, IT WAS THE ONLY
THING THAT LYLA SAID

807
00:36:27,853 --> 00:36:29,312
HELPED HER WITH
HER NAUSEA.

808
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:30,856
THEY'RE GINGER
CANDY CHEWS.

809
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:32,816
OH, GOD. I'LL TRY ANYTHING.

810
00:36:32,858 --> 00:36:34,818
MORNING SICKNESS
OR NOT, FELICITY,

811
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,278
YOU HAVE NOT
MISSED A BEAT.

812
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,405
YOU WERE
ABSOLUTELY AMAZING
OUT THERE TODAY.

813
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:41,074
YOUR TECH WAS
PHENOMENAL.

814
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:43,368
WELL, CURTIS WOULD'VE HAD
5 IDEAS TO MAKE IT BETTER,

815
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:44,744
-BUT...
-WELL, MAYBE...

816
00:36:44,786 --> 00:36:46,163
BUT IF CURTIS WAS
STILL AT A.R.G.U.S.,

817
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,497
I WOULD'VE ASKED HIM
TO BUY YOUR TECH.

818
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:49,290
AND I'M SURE A.R.G.U.S.
WOULDN'T BE

819
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:51,960
THE ONLY CORPORATION
HUNTING FOR IT.

820
00:36:52,002 --> 00:36:54,295
AND I THINK THAT'S MORE
THAN A SECURITY SYSTEM

821
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:56,048
YOU'RE WORKING ON.

822
00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:58,758
I THINK YOU'RE ON
TO SOMETHING BIG.

823
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:14,315
THANK YOU FOR COMING IN.

824
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:17,110
I'M LAUREL LANCE,
DISTRICT ATTORNEY.

825
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:19,071
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

826
00:37:19,112 --> 00:37:21,656
AND I KNOW WHO YOU
ARE, TOO.

827
00:37:21,698 --> 00:37:24,450
EMIKO ADACHI.

828
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:26,661
YOUR MOTHER WAS
KILLED A YEAR AGO.

829
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:28,580
YOUR FATHER IS
ROBERT QUEEN.

830
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:31,041
AND FOR
THE LAST 7 MONTHS,

831
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:33,292
YOU'VE BEEN RUNNING
AROUND THE CITY

832
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:34,669
DRESSED LIKE YOUR
BROTHER.

833
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:36,880
AND YOU'VE ALSO MANAGED
TO ENDEAR YOURSELF

834
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:38,757
TO OLIVER
AND HIS TEAM.

835
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:40,717
I ALSO KNOW THAT
YOU WERE AT SLABSIDE

836
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:42,761
THE NIGHT
THAT RICARDO DIAZ
BURNED TO DEATH.

837
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:44,846
WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

838
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:47,515
THAT YOU'RE LYING ABOUT
WHO YOU REALLY ARE.

839
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:49,475
YOU'RE NOT A HERO.

840
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:51,937
AND I WONDER HOW OLIVER
AND HIS TEAM WILL FEEL

841
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:54,106
WHEN THEY FIND OUT
THAT THEIR NEW
VIGILANTE FRIEND

842
00:37:54,147 --> 00:37:57,525
MURDERED DIAZ
IN COLD BLOOD.

843
00:37:57,567 --> 00:37:59,778
I'M GUESSING FAMILY
DINNERS ARE GONNA BE

844
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,320
A LITTLE BIT MORE
AWKWARD.

845
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:04,699
AND, UH,
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK

846
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:08,620
THEY WILL BELIEVE
A WORD YOU SAY,

847
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:11,164
BLACK SIREN?

848
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:22,259
DO YOU THINK I'M SHOWING,
JUST EVEN A LITTLE?

849
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,303
I THINK YOU LOOK
EXACTLY THE SAME.

850
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:29,057
HOW YOU FEELING?

851
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:30,934
OH, I FEEL LIKE I
COULD SLEEP FOR 2 WEEKS.

852
00:38:30,976 --> 00:38:33,061
OH, YEAH.

853
00:38:33,103 --> 00:38:36,940
HEY, SO IN BETWEEN
UPDATING THE SCPD's TECH

854
00:38:36,982 --> 00:38:38,942
AND TAKING DOWN EVIL CEOS,

855
00:38:38,984 --> 00:38:41,945
I WAS BRAINSTORMING
BABY NAMES TODAY.

856
00:38:41,987 --> 00:38:43,113
-REALLY?
-YEAH.

857
00:38:43,155 --> 00:38:44,697
ANY FRONTRUNNERS?

858
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:47,742
FOR A BOY, I'VE
ALWAYS LIKED LUCAS.

859
00:38:47,784 --> 00:38:50,495
YEAH. LUCAS.

860
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:52,747
THAT'S GOOD.

861
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:56,168
I MAY HAVE THOUGHT
OF A NAME FOR A GIRL.

862
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:57,543
YEAH?

863
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:02,715
MIA.

864
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,717
SHORT FOR MOIRA.

865
00:39:06,178 --> 00:39:08,888
SWEET AND FIERY.

866
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:11,850
I LOVE IT.

867
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:14,269
AND REGARDLESS OF
WHETHER WE HAVE

868
00:39:14,311 --> 00:39:16,104
A BOY OR A GIRL...

869
00:39:16,146 --> 00:39:17,396
[CHUCKLES SOFTLY]

870
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:19,398
I JUST WANT TO MAKE
SURE THAT...

871
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,195
SHE OR HE END UP...

872
00:39:23,236 --> 00:39:25,446
GROWING UP IN
A BETTER AND SAFER
STAR CITY

873
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,032
THAN I DID.

874
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:28,574
YEAH.

875
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,910
I WANT THAT FOR BOTH
OF OUR CHILDREN.

876
00:39:34,247 --> 00:39:36,541
THEY'LL ALWAYS HAVE
EACH OTHER TO LEAN ON.

877
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:38,626
AND WE'LL ALWAYS HAVE US.

878
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,423
WHAT ARE YOU
WAITING FOR?

879
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:46,092
LET'S PLAY
THE DAMN THING.

880
00:39:46,134 --> 00:39:47,802
I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

881
00:39:47,844 --> 00:39:50,263
FINE.

882
00:39:53,892 --> 00:39:55,310
MAYBE I SHOULD DO IT.

883
00:39:55,352 --> 00:39:57,229
IT'S NOT AS EASY
AS IT LOOK...

884
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:58,938
JUST GIVE IT TO ME.

885
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:05,444
THIS IS SOME, LIKE,
FEELINGS THING,
ISN'T IT?

886
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:08,240
WELL, I HAVEN'T HEARD
FELICITY'S VOICE

887
00:40:08,281 --> 00:40:12,077
IN ALMOST TWO DECADES,
SO, YEAH, IT IS.

888
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:14,662
LOOK, WHATEVER
SHE SAYS ON THERE,

889
00:40:14,704 --> 00:40:17,999
IT'S CLEAR SHE WANTED
BOTH OF US TO HEAR IT...

890
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:20,085
TOGETHER.

891
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:25,090
ALL RIGHT. LET'S JUST
GET THIS OVER WITH.

892
00:40:28,385 --> 00:40:30,469
FELICITY: WILLIAM AND MIA,

893
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:31,679
YOU KNOW,
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME

894
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:34,057
I'VE EVER SAID
YOUR NAMES TOGETHER?

895
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:36,517
20 YEARS, AND I AVOID
EVER SAYING YOUR NAMES
IN THE SAME SENTENCE.

896
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:39,229
IT FEELS LIKE
THE WORK OF A PARANOID,
OVERPROTECTIVE MOTHER.

897
00:40:39,271 --> 00:40:41,106
I GUESS WE REALLY DO
TURN INTO OUR PARENTS.

898
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:43,024
I'M RAMBLING. SORRY.

899
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:44,859
NOT JUST FOR THE RAMBLING.

900
00:40:44,901 --> 00:40:48,238
FOR EVERYTHING, BUT MOSTLY FOR
KEEPING THE TWO OF YOU APART.

901
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,865
I'M NOT ASKING
FOR YOUR FORGIVENESS,

902
00:40:50,907 --> 00:40:54,077
BUT JUST KNOW THAT YOUR FATHER
AND I DID IT TO PROTECT YOU.

903
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:56,371
WE DID IT BECAUSE WE LOVE YOU.

904
00:40:56,413 --> 00:40:58,081
NOW THAT YOU'VE FOUND
EACH OTHER,

905
00:40:58,123 --> 00:40:59,874
I JUST HAVE
ONE REQUEST.

906
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:02,335
GIVE THESE COORDINATES TO
THE TEAM:

907
00:41:02,377 --> 00:41:07,673
47.6119 NORTH, 122.3301 WEST.

908
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:10,302
AND THEN GET THE HELL OUT OF
STAR CITY.

909
00:41:10,343 --> 00:41:12,511
AND WHATEVER YOU DO,
DON'T COME LOOKING FOR ME.

910
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:19,018
SO WE'RE
IGNORING HER.

911
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,686
DEFINITELY.

912
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:25,900
I KNOW WHERE THESE LEAD.

913
00:41:29,362 --> 00:41:31,990
THAT'S WHERE.

914
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:39,622
WE'RE GOING OVER THE WALL...

915
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:41,416
TO THE GLADES.

916
00:42:08,193 --> 00:42:09,610
MAN: GREG, MOVE YOUR HEAD!
