1
00:00:02,205 --> 00:00:04,075
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,076 --> 00:00:06,363
After 5 years in Hell,
I returned home

3
00:00:06,364 --> 00:00:08,964
with only one goal--
to save my city.

4
00:00:09,169 --> 00:00:11,169
Today, I fight that war
on two fronts.

5
00:00:11,171 --> 00:00:13,572
By day, I lead Star City
as its mayor,

6
00:00:13,574 --> 00:00:16,041
but by night,
I am someone else.

7
00:00:16,043 --> 00:00:18,176
I am...Something else.

8
00:00:18,178 --> 00:00:20,679
I am the Green Arrow.

9
00:00:20,681 --> 00:00:22,213
Previously on "Arrow"...

10
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,185
Traitor! I'm taking
you to hell with--

11
00:00:27,187 --> 00:00:29,054
Sorry you didn't
get to know your father.

12
00:00:29,056 --> 00:00:30,822
I guess you're stuck
knowing me.

13
00:00:30,824 --> 00:00:33,325
What I saw in her
is what I see here.

14
00:00:33,327 --> 00:00:36,061
Sounds crazy,
but if there is,

15
00:00:36,063 --> 00:00:37,329
there's--there's some way to get
through to her.

16
00:00:37,331 --> 00:00:39,097
We have a massively
huge problem.

17
00:00:39,099 --> 00:00:41,032
- What is it?
- The nanothermite when combined

18
00:00:41,034 --> 00:00:42,434
with the explosive creates
a thermobaric weapon.

19
00:00:42,436 --> 00:00:44,235
Cayden James
could do it,

20
00:00:44,237 --> 00:00:45,804
and he'd probably
detonate it in a populated area.

21
00:00:45,806 --> 00:00:47,339
Maximize casualties.

22
00:00:47,341 --> 00:00:48,673
Your city's entire
infrastructure

23
00:00:48,675 --> 00:00:50,175
is under my control--

24
00:00:50,177 --> 00:00:54,212
buildings, institutions,
even people

25
00:00:54,214 --> 00:00:56,181
all under my dominion.

26
00:00:56,183 --> 00:00:58,016
These are innocent
people.

27
00:00:58,018 --> 00:01:01,486
And you can save them
by wiring $10 million

28
00:01:01,488 --> 00:01:05,724
into that offshore account
no later than 11:30 tonight

29
00:01:05,726 --> 00:01:07,392
and every night.

30
00:01:07,394 --> 00:01:08,994
Wire the money.

31
00:01:18,372 --> 00:01:21,006
All right.
We're all set here.

32
00:01:21,008 --> 00:01:23,408
Captain Hill, thank you
for stepping up

33
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:25,010
to lead the department.

34
00:01:25,012 --> 00:01:26,478
I wish it was
under better circumstances.

35
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,146
After tonight,
they will be.

36
00:01:28,148 --> 00:01:29,881
All right. Take me
through the details.

37
00:01:29,883 --> 00:01:31,850
We know Cayden James
is monitoring traffic

38
00:01:31,852 --> 00:01:33,818
in and out of the city--airports,
highways, ports,

39
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,154
but the shoreline
might be the blind spot.

40
00:01:36,156 --> 00:01:38,123
Specifically, right here,
there's no satellite

41
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:39,891
flyover for about
10 minutes.

42
00:01:39,893 --> 00:01:42,293
- That's our window.
- And SWAT has the perimeter,

43
00:01:42,295 --> 00:01:43,962
so no one's getting
in or out without us knowing it.

44
00:01:43,964 --> 00:01:45,764
Good. When do
we make contact?

45
00:01:45,766 --> 00:01:47,866
Should be any minute.

46
00:01:58,412 --> 00:02:01,379
Mr. Mayor, I'm
Alex Scott, A.R.G.U.S.

47
00:02:01,381 --> 00:02:02,447
- Good to meet you.
- We're good to move?

48
00:02:02,449 --> 00:02:04,182
Yes.

49
00:02:04,184 --> 00:02:06,451
All clear on shore.
Exit, exit.

50
00:02:07,487 --> 00:02:08,653
- Ugh!
- What's wrong?

51
00:02:08,655 --> 00:02:09,921
No. Just some
weird feedback.

52
00:02:09,923 --> 00:02:11,122
Are your comms
line of sight?

53
00:02:11,124 --> 00:02:12,190
No. We're patched in.

54
00:02:12,192 --> 00:02:13,525
You got to get
those things off!

55
00:02:13,527 --> 00:02:15,193
Aah!

56
00:02:15,195 --> 00:02:16,895
Got to get the other
divers out of the water!

57
00:02:30,955 --> 00:02:34,955

60
00:02:51,064 --> 00:02:54,599
Ahem. At this point,
we've got maybe another day or two.

61
00:02:54,601 --> 00:02:56,434
What about
the federal government?

62
00:02:56,436 --> 00:02:58,236
I mean, don't they have
plans for this kind of stuff?

63
00:02:58,238 --> 00:02:59,804
A.R.G.U.S was
our best shot,

64
00:02:59,806 --> 00:03:01,573
and Cayden James
was ready for it.

65
00:03:01,575 --> 00:03:06,111
I--I think that we
are on our own.

66
00:03:06,113 --> 00:03:07,479
So does that mean
I go forward

67
00:03:07,481 --> 00:03:08,813
with the emergency
bomb shelters?

68
00:03:08,815 --> 00:03:10,615
Yeah. We need
a contingency.

69
00:03:10,617 --> 00:03:13,284
It--it won't save
everyone,

70
00:03:13,286 --> 00:03:16,654
but it's a--
it's a start.

71
00:03:16,656 --> 00:03:18,490
How's William
holding up?

72
00:03:18,492 --> 00:03:20,325
Doing as well
as can be expected.

73
00:03:20,327 --> 00:03:23,294
He's holed up at
an A.R.G.U.S. safe house

74
00:03:23,296 --> 00:03:27,065
with Raisa
and a PlayStation 4.

75
00:03:27,067 --> 00:03:29,501
You look like you could
use some rest.

76
00:03:29,503 --> 00:03:30,935
I'll get some
if you will.

77
00:03:30,937 --> 00:03:33,505
Like brother,
like sister, I guess.

78
00:03:35,976 --> 00:03:38,243
Hey. Don't worry, ok?

79
00:03:38,245 --> 00:03:42,680
Cayden James is not the first guy
to try to take our city hostage.

80
00:03:42,682 --> 00:03:44,649
We will figure it out.

81
00:03:51,491 --> 00:03:54,659
Cayden James' hold on Star City
has reached 8 days

82
00:03:54,661 --> 00:03:56,327
and counting now
with all routes

83
00:03:56,329 --> 00:03:59,664
in and out of the city
under James' control.

84
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,666
Though Mayor Queen
has urged for calm,

85
00:04:01,668 --> 00:04:04,102
tensions are running high
as the threat

86
00:04:04,104 --> 00:04:06,538
of the thermobaric bomb
continues to loom.

87
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,574
With supplies running low
and desperation growing,

88
00:04:09,576 --> 00:04:11,209
many are left wondering,

89
00:04:11,211 --> 00:04:14,813
how long will the city last
before it implodes?

90
00:04:14,815 --> 00:04:16,581
That's a damn good
question.

91
00:04:39,673 --> 00:04:41,206
You're late.

92
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:43,908
Sorry. SCPD's been dealing
with the fallout

93
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:45,510
from last night's
debacle.

94
00:04:45,512 --> 00:04:46,911
I didn't know
about the A.R.G.U.S. team

95
00:04:46,913 --> 00:04:48,646
until after Cayden
killed them.

96
00:04:48,648 --> 00:04:50,582
You believe me,
right?

97
00:04:50,584 --> 00:04:53,117
Cayden James likes to play
things close to the vest,

98
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:55,186
even with the people
he's supposedly in league with.

99
00:04:55,188 --> 00:04:57,355
Which makes finding
the location

100
00:04:57,357 --> 00:05:00,725
of the thermobaric
bomb very difficult.

101
00:05:00,727 --> 00:05:02,727
You believe me, right,

102
00:05:02,729 --> 00:05:05,063
about not knowing about
the A.R.G.U.S. divers?

103
00:05:05,065 --> 00:05:06,865
I already told you
I do.

104
00:05:06,867 --> 00:05:10,435
I guess what I'm
asking is

105
00:05:10,437 --> 00:05:12,370
do you trust me?

106
00:05:23,183 --> 00:05:25,550
Does that answer
your question?

107
00:05:38,798 --> 00:05:40,965
- Sorry I'm late.
- Don't be sorry.

108
00:05:40,967 --> 00:05:42,734
Just don't be late.

109
00:05:42,736 --> 00:05:45,770
Vincent Sobel, meet
Dinah Drake.

110
00:05:52,212 --> 00:05:54,712
Tina Boland is
my cover name.

111
00:05:54,714 --> 00:05:57,682
Tina Boland?
You got quite the rep.

112
00:05:57,684 --> 00:05:59,450
No idea you were a cop.

113
00:05:59,452 --> 00:06:00,885
That's the idea,
isn't it?

114
00:06:00,887 --> 00:06:02,954
Vince has spent
the last 8 months

115
00:06:02,956 --> 00:06:04,822
in Sean Sonus'
operation.

116
00:06:04,824 --> 00:06:07,058
And he is smart.

117
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,693
He makes sure that
no one person ever sees

118
00:06:08,695 --> 00:06:10,428
enough of the whole picture.

119
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,463
Sounds like you could use
an extra set of hands.

120
00:06:12,465 --> 00:06:14,632
And eyes and ears.

121
00:06:15,869 --> 00:06:17,802
I got to tell you,

122
00:06:17,804 --> 00:06:20,338
Sonus isn't just smart.

123
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,807
He's unpredictable.

124
00:06:24,477 --> 00:06:26,210
This could go south fast.

125
00:06:26,212 --> 00:06:28,012
When do we start?

126
00:06:31,651 --> 00:06:35,186
Didn't know we were having
a clubhouse meeting.

127
00:06:35,188 --> 00:06:38,022
Only boys allowed
today or what?

128
00:06:39,693 --> 00:06:42,460
Ms. Lance is
en route.

129
00:06:42,462 --> 00:06:44,729
This is less a meeting
than it is a wake

130
00:06:44,731 --> 00:06:47,699
for Mr. Sheck.

131
00:06:47,701 --> 00:06:50,435
He bought the farm
a week ago.

132
00:06:50,437 --> 00:06:52,704
I didn't think we
were sentimental like that.

133
00:06:52,706 --> 00:06:54,806
It's not
sentimental.

134
00:06:54,808 --> 00:06:57,508
Surprised.

135
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:00,979
Oliver would not
kill man this way.

136
00:07:00,981 --> 00:07:02,847
None of his team would.

137
00:07:02,849 --> 00:07:05,116
The place wasn't
lacking for cops.

138
00:07:05,118 --> 00:07:07,518
One of them probably
took him out.

139
00:07:11,624 --> 00:07:15,293
What's really behind this
sudden paranoia?

140
00:07:15,295 --> 00:07:17,061
Mr. Queen was obviously
able to get word

141
00:07:17,063 --> 00:07:19,998
outside the cordon
we placed around the city.

142
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
To A.R.G.U.S.,
you mean?

143
00:07:22,002 --> 00:07:24,769
- He seems more than capable.
- Agreed,

144
00:07:24,771 --> 00:07:29,707
but it was unexpected,

145
00:07:31,911 --> 00:07:35,313
I don't like surprises,

146
00:07:35,315 --> 00:07:37,081
and I like even less
the feeling

147
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:39,517
that I can't trust
my comrades.

148
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,887
It sounds like it's
just me you don't trust.

149
00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:47,091
If I didn't, you wouldn't
be drawing breath right now, Mr. Sobel.

150
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:56,768
Oh. Oh, I love your face,

151
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:59,737
but that is just not
a good face.

152
00:07:59,739 --> 00:08:01,339
What's up?

153
00:08:01,341 --> 00:08:03,207
Just spent the past
two hours trying

154
00:08:03,209 --> 00:08:05,076
to convince
the city council

155
00:08:05,078 --> 00:08:09,113
that we will get out from underneath
Cayden James' thumb.

156
00:08:09,115 --> 00:08:11,449
I'm not sure even I
believe that at this point.

157
00:08:11,451 --> 00:08:13,885
Hey.

158
00:08:15,722 --> 00:08:17,255
You know what I'm
looking forward to

159
00:08:17,257 --> 00:08:18,956
once we put
Cayden James away?

160
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:21,759
- What's that?
- Our honeymoon.

161
00:08:21,761 --> 00:08:23,461
Heh.

162
00:08:23,463 --> 00:08:25,363
We are going
on a honeymoon, right?

163
00:08:25,365 --> 00:08:28,332
- Aruba.
- Aruba. Ooh.

164
00:08:29,836 --> 00:08:32,103
Mm-hmm. Any news here?

165
00:08:32,105 --> 00:08:34,539
We split the city in half
with the other team.

166
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:36,774
Divide and conquer
is not getting us any closer

167
00:08:36,776 --> 00:08:38,276
to finding
Cayden James.

168
00:08:38,278 --> 00:08:39,911
Our sector has been
quiet for a few hours.

169
00:08:41,381 --> 00:08:44,382
"Has been" being
the operative phrase.

170
00:08:44,384 --> 00:08:46,317
Ok. Facial recognition
picked up vigilante.

171
00:08:46,319 --> 00:08:48,286
Despite his mask
having no face,

172
00:08:48,288 --> 00:08:50,221
Cayden James' people
don't ordinarily walk around like that.

173
00:08:50,223 --> 00:08:51,656
We might have
caught a break.

174
00:08:51,658 --> 00:08:53,124
Let's text John
the location.

175
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,369
I'm headed your way.

176
00:09:18,118 --> 00:09:19,817
You going somewhere?

177
00:09:19,819 --> 00:09:22,153
Where's Cayden James?

178
00:09:25,024 --> 00:09:26,824
You're making a mistake.

179
00:09:26,826 --> 00:09:27,992
You've got
3 seconds.

180
00:09:27,994 --> 00:09:29,694
- Oliver, listen.
- 1...

181
00:09:29,696 --> 00:09:31,429
- I'm trying to stop Cayden.
- 2...

182
00:09:31,431 --> 00:09:34,866
- I can't blow my cover.
- 3.

183
00:09:34,868 --> 00:09:36,834
Hold your fire!
Don't shoot, don't shoot!

184
00:09:36,836 --> 00:09:38,836
- He's a friendly!
- What?!

185
00:09:38,838 --> 00:09:41,038
He's here
for a meet with us.

186
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,640
He's undercover
with James' group.

187
00:09:42,642 --> 00:09:45,710
We were gonna tell
you guys...Eventually.

188
00:09:53,598 --> 00:09:55,175
I can't believe
that you had time

189
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:57,035
to secretly put
all this together

190
00:09:57,036 --> 00:09:58,969
and continue starting
our startup.

191
00:09:59,236 --> 00:10:03,255
Well, being single does wonders for
your time management.

192
00:10:03,355 --> 00:10:06,456
Ok. On your next date,
you are not allowed to lead with that.

193
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:08,291
How do you know
you can trust him?

194
00:10:08,293 --> 00:10:10,093
He saved
my life last week.

195
00:10:10,095 --> 00:10:11,828
Killed one of James' men
to do it.

196
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:13,864
And he's in love
with Dinah.

197
00:10:13,866 --> 00:10:15,532
Just stating facts.

198
00:10:15,534 --> 00:10:17,968
Vince is working
on locating the thermobaric bomb.

199
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:19,336
We take that out
of play,

200
00:10:19,338 --> 00:10:22,105
and we got the situation
handled.

201
00:10:22,107 --> 00:10:23,707
What kind of progress
are you making

202
00:10:23,709 --> 00:10:25,108
locating the bomb?

203
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:26,710
Not much.
Cayden keeps the bomb

204
00:10:26,712 --> 00:10:28,011
on the move constantly

205
00:10:28,013 --> 00:10:29,780
and has become
especially paranoid

206
00:10:29,782 --> 00:10:31,782
since I killed
one of his men.

207
00:10:31,784 --> 00:10:33,984
Your stunt with A.R.G.U.S. last night
didn't help matters.

208
00:10:33,986 --> 00:10:37,254
So why don't you just take us
to where Cayden and his men are hiding?

209
00:10:37,256 --> 00:10:40,023
Because the second you show up,
he'll detonate the bomb.

210
00:10:40,025 --> 00:10:41,992
With the amplifier
he has,

211
00:10:41,994 --> 00:10:43,660
he'll take out
the city.

212
00:10:43,662 --> 00:10:45,295
He's right,
and until we find out

213
00:10:45,297 --> 00:10:47,297
where that bomb is,
we've got no moves.

214
00:10:47,299 --> 00:10:49,199
Ok. Well, then we just--
we find out where the bomb is.

215
00:10:49,201 --> 00:10:50,967
Last year, we used
a sniffer device

216
00:10:50,969 --> 00:10:52,736
to pull information from Prometheus'
mother's house.

217
00:10:52,738 --> 00:10:54,604
You want to use the same device
for Cayden James?

218
00:10:54,606 --> 00:10:56,173
That's exactly
what I want to do.

219
00:10:56,175 --> 00:10:57,974
We can gather all
his ones and zeroes.

220
00:10:57,976 --> 00:10:59,776
There's got to be a scrap of data left
in there somewhere.

221
00:10:59,778 --> 00:11:01,745
Then we have someone to
plant Felicity's toy for us.

222
00:11:01,747 --> 00:11:03,513
Yeah.
There's just one small problem.

223
00:11:03,515 --> 00:11:06,516
- Just one?
- Well, two, actually.

224
00:11:06,518 --> 00:11:08,752
The sniffer needs to be
manually implanted into Cayden's server.

225
00:11:08,754 --> 00:11:10,721
No. No, no.
There's no way he can do that

226
00:11:10,723 --> 00:11:12,489
without Cayden
noticing, Felicity,

227
00:11:12,491 --> 00:11:13,957
especially now that
he's circling the wagons.

228
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:15,926
I knew what I
signed up for.

229
00:11:15,928 --> 00:11:19,930
I didn't expect this
to be easy.

230
00:11:19,932 --> 00:11:22,899
- What else?
- Ok. Cayden's server is deep

231
00:11:22,901 --> 00:11:24,701
within the building, so while
our comms will be working,

232
00:11:24,703 --> 00:11:26,903
transmitting a data pull that large,
it requires line of sight.

233
00:11:26,905 --> 00:11:28,905
Which means
you have to install the sniffer,

234
00:11:28,907 --> 00:11:30,874
then wait for it to download the content
of Cayden James' server.

235
00:11:30,876 --> 00:11:32,876
Making sure Cayden
doesn't see you or the sniffer.

236
00:11:32,878 --> 00:11:34,544
- That would be bad, very bad.
- And then get it outside

237
00:11:34,546 --> 00:11:35,979
so you can transmit
the files.

238
00:11:35,981 --> 00:11:38,081
Yeah. That sounds like
more than two problems.

239
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:39,816
Sounds like a good way
of getting yourself killed.

240
00:11:39,818 --> 00:11:42,252
Then it's a good thing
I heal fast.

241
00:11:43,756 --> 00:11:48,158
Vince...May I speak
with you, please?

242
00:11:55,167 --> 00:11:58,101
Ms. Queen, I'm telling
you there is nothing liquid,

243
00:11:58,103 --> 00:12:00,270
and we have no way
of borrowing capital.

244
00:12:00,272 --> 00:12:01,805
Jay, that's just not
gonna work for us,

245
00:12:01,807 --> 00:12:06,276
so I need you to try
to find more money.

246
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,580
I might be able to pull
a few hundred thousand, but that--

247
00:12:10,582 --> 00:12:12,816
That's not gonna be enough money
for Cayden James,

248
00:12:12,818 --> 00:12:16,887
so I just-- I need you to try
and find some more.

249
00:12:19,825 --> 00:12:24,861
Sorry. Sometimes,
he just needs to be pushed a little bit.

250
00:12:27,232 --> 00:12:28,532
Quentin, what's up?

251
00:12:28,534 --> 00:12:30,000
Uh, she's been
following me.

252
00:12:30,002 --> 00:12:31,701
- Laurel?
- Yeah.

253
00:12:31,703 --> 00:12:33,870
It--it started
a couple of days ago.

254
00:12:33,872 --> 00:12:35,806
Ok. Have you
talked to her?

255
00:12:35,808 --> 00:12:37,507
Not quite.

256
00:12:39,978 --> 00:12:42,479
Every time I turn around,
she disappears.

257
00:12:42,481 --> 00:12:44,314
What do you think
it means?

258
00:12:44,316 --> 00:12:46,650
I think maybe we
made some kind of connection.

259
00:12:46,652 --> 00:12:50,187
She wants to reach out,
but...she's afraid.

260
00:12:50,189 --> 00:12:52,722
Does that sound
crazy?

261
00:12:52,724 --> 00:12:56,726
No. Not after everything
we've seen lately. No.

262
00:12:56,728 --> 00:12:59,029
- So what do we do?
- If it seems like

263
00:12:59,031 --> 00:13:01,231
she's trying to
reach out to you,

264
00:13:01,233 --> 00:13:03,900
then--I don't know--
maybe we just got to find

265
00:13:03,902 --> 00:13:07,504
a way for you
to reach out to her.

266
00:13:13,445 --> 00:13:15,345
What's on your mind?

267
00:13:15,347 --> 00:13:18,048
Dinah, Curtis,
and Rene trust you.

268
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:19,382
I'm not there yet.

269
00:13:19,384 --> 00:13:21,051
I want you to try
to imagine

270
00:13:21,053 --> 00:13:22,919
how little
I give a damn.

271
00:13:22,921 --> 00:13:24,855
You've taken a shot
at me.

272
00:13:24,857 --> 00:13:26,857
Matter of fact,
you've taken a shot

273
00:13:26,859 --> 00:13:28,859
at nearly everybody
in that room,

274
00:13:28,861 --> 00:13:31,695
so I will be convinced
that you are not

275
00:13:31,697 --> 00:13:33,430
playing us the way
that you claim

276
00:13:33,432 --> 00:13:35,499
to be playing
Cayden James.

277
00:13:35,501 --> 00:13:38,068
I don't have to
convince you

278
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:40,937
because you're not
stopping me from doing this.

279
00:13:40,939 --> 00:13:42,873
- Are you sure?
- I am,

280
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:45,275
because you know
saving this city means

281
00:13:45,277 --> 00:13:47,878
doing whatever's
necessary,

282
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,380
and you know that
means using me.

283
00:14:01,293 --> 00:14:03,960
Did Oliver push you
to do this?

284
00:14:03,962 --> 00:14:06,596
He didn't have to, D.
It's the right play.

285
00:14:08,033 --> 00:14:09,933
Hey. It's gonna
be ok.

286
00:14:09,935 --> 00:14:13,136
I'm not so sure. Something just
doesn't feel right,

287
00:14:13,138 --> 00:14:14,604
you know, the same way
it did for you

288
00:14:14,606 --> 00:14:16,006
when everything
went bad with Sonus.

289
00:14:16,008 --> 00:14:17,641
That was my call, D.

290
00:14:17,643 --> 00:14:19,776
Don't you wear
that guilt.

291
00:14:19,778 --> 00:14:21,478
I don't want to
lose you again.

292
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,014
I'm so happy
to hear that,

293
00:14:24,016 --> 00:14:25,949
and you won't.

294
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:40,630
Aces and queens.

295
00:14:40,632 --> 00:14:42,232
Got me.

296
00:14:42,234 --> 00:14:46,102
And you are
in the black barely.

297
00:14:46,104 --> 00:14:48,605
- Thanks.
- Yeah. This cash inflow

298
00:14:48,607 --> 00:14:50,307
coming from
San Francisco was huge,

299
00:14:50,309 --> 00:14:51,975
but it wasn't
very efficient.

300
00:14:51,977 --> 00:14:53,743
You know, if I knew
more, I might be able

301
00:14:53,745 --> 00:14:56,313
to maximize
the revenue stream.

302
00:14:56,315 --> 00:15:00,116
Sorry. I know I'm
not supposed to ask specifics.

303
00:15:00,118 --> 00:15:03,453
Just we need a little more of it,
that's all I'm saying.

304
00:15:03,455 --> 00:15:05,522
I'll take that
under advisement.

305
00:15:05,524 --> 00:15:08,458
All right.

306
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:11,695
Well, I'm going to
go home for the night.

307
00:15:15,968 --> 00:15:17,300
Good night, boys.

308
00:15:17,302 --> 00:15:18,969
I'll walk
with you.

309
00:15:18,971 --> 00:15:22,539
Ahem. Can't let a lady
walk home alone, hmm?

310
00:15:25,344 --> 00:15:28,311
That was subtle.
What, you didn't have a neon sign?

311
00:15:28,313 --> 00:15:31,181
It's fine.
No one noticed.

312
00:15:37,222 --> 00:15:38,855
So what'd his
books say?

313
00:15:38,857 --> 00:15:40,190
He's got a boatload
of money floating around

314
00:15:40,192 --> 00:15:42,092
neither of us
have eyes on,

315
00:15:42,094 --> 00:15:43,827
and seriously, Vince,

316
00:15:43,829 --> 00:15:45,762
Sonus should not
see us together.

317
00:15:45,764 --> 00:15:48,398
They all think I'm
just trying to get in your pants.

318
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:53,103
Hmm. Well, if only
wishing made it so.

319
00:16:04,383 --> 00:16:08,084
Nice. Love what
you guys haven't done with the place. Heh.

320
00:16:08,086 --> 00:16:09,886
Let's get this
over with.

321
00:16:09,888 --> 00:16:12,589
We, uh, turned
your room into a home gym because--

322
00:16:12,591 --> 00:16:14,658
because this extremely
awkward situation

323
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,292
needs to be masked
with humor.

324
00:16:16,294 --> 00:16:18,695
I think what
she means to say is welcome back.

325
00:16:18,697 --> 00:16:21,097
We have the inside man.
You have the tech.

326
00:16:21,099 --> 00:16:23,033
That's the only reason
we're back, Hoss.

327
00:16:23,035 --> 00:16:26,436
- Is Vince on site?
- Should be as of 5 minutes ago.

328
00:16:26,438 --> 00:16:29,205
That is if everything
goes according to plan.

329
00:16:29,207 --> 00:16:31,007
You sound
like it might not.

330
00:16:31,009 --> 00:16:32,509
Vince said he doesn't have
access to the server room,

331
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,110
so if anyone spots him
in there, he's gonna have

332
00:16:34,112 --> 00:16:35,412
a lot of explaining
to do.

333
00:16:35,414 --> 00:16:37,113
We've got eyes.

334
00:16:37,115 --> 00:16:39,082
- Can I talk to him?
- Yeah.

335
00:16:39,084 --> 00:16:42,118
Hey, Vince. You get
any kind of bad feeling here at all,

336
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,287
you abort,
you hear me?

337
00:16:44,289 --> 00:16:47,924
Don't worry.
I'll see you soon.

338
00:16:47,926 --> 00:16:50,460
He's at the server.

339
00:16:50,462 --> 00:16:52,762
The door to
the server room's locked.

340
00:16:52,764 --> 00:16:54,464
You guys have
a solve for this?

341
00:16:54,466 --> 00:16:56,866
Try 06141998.

342
00:16:56,868 --> 00:16:59,703
- Try?
- It's his son's birthday.

343
00:16:59,705 --> 00:17:01,171
If you're wrong,
he's dead.

344
00:17:01,173 --> 00:17:02,172
I'm not gonna be wrong.

345
00:17:07,179 --> 00:17:09,612
Phew.

346
00:17:09,614 --> 00:17:11,147
Ok, Vince.
You're in the red zone.

347
00:17:11,149 --> 00:17:13,349
Just let the sniffer
do its thing.

348
00:17:22,828 --> 00:17:25,228
Whew. 80 terabytes of data.
You guys can get comfortable.

349
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:27,363
This is gonna take
a minute.

350
00:17:29,201 --> 00:17:30,967
Mr. Sobel?

351
00:17:33,705 --> 00:17:35,939
Frak.

352
00:17:35,941 --> 00:17:38,308
I think we need
to talk.

353
00:17:41,589 --> 00:17:44,030
All of my people
have specific domains.

354
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:46,384
I don't believe that
I.T. Is one of yours,

355
00:17:46,484 --> 00:17:48,484
which means you
would not have

356
00:17:48,486 --> 00:17:50,619
a proper passcode
to enter.

357
00:17:50,621 --> 00:17:52,321
How much data's
been copied?

358
00:17:52,323 --> 00:17:53,756
20%.

359
00:17:53,758 --> 00:17:55,457
No, but Mr. Sheck did.

360
00:17:55,459 --> 00:17:57,926
He was a little more
loose-lipped than you'd like.

361
00:17:57,928 --> 00:17:59,628
Rest in peace.

362
00:18:01,732 --> 00:18:05,701
Still doesn't explain
what exactly you're doing in here.

363
00:18:05,703 --> 00:18:06,668
We got to pull him out.

364
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,303
- Dinah, not yet.
- Oliver!

365
00:18:08,305 --> 00:18:10,639
Ok, wait.
Vince, if you want to stay alive,

366
00:18:10,641 --> 00:18:13,008
repeat exactly
what I say.

367
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:14,243
You think just...

368
00:18:14,245 --> 00:18:16,011
Because I can
handle a gun

369
00:18:16,013 --> 00:18:17,513
doesn't mean I know
the difference

370
00:18:17,515 --> 00:18:18,881
between
a trans-polymer hybrid

371
00:18:18,883 --> 00:18:20,883
and a fiber optic cable.

372
00:18:20,885 --> 00:18:22,317
I'm just impressed.

373
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:24,086
I wanted to know

374
00:18:24,088 --> 00:18:27,289
how you maximized
the data throughput.

375
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:30,526
Sorry. I should
have asked first.

376
00:18:30,528 --> 00:18:33,061
Perhaps.

377
00:18:34,665 --> 00:18:38,167
I may have
underestimated you.

378
00:18:38,169 --> 00:18:41,003
It seems that you have
more skill than I gave you credit for.

379
00:18:41,005 --> 00:18:45,874
I keep telling people
I'm more than just a pretty face.

380
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:48,644
Keep him talking.
We're at 80%.

381
00:18:48,646 --> 00:18:52,781
Funny thing is
I underestimated you, too.

382
00:18:52,783 --> 00:18:55,083
- Is that right?
- When you recruited me

383
00:18:55,085 --> 00:18:57,853
to help you take
this city from Oliver Queen,

384
00:18:57,855 --> 00:18:59,655
I didn't think
you'd have the resolve

385
00:18:59,657 --> 00:19:03,192
to do what was necessary to make
him fear you.

386
00:19:03,194 --> 00:19:06,028
- I was wrong.
- Does that mean that you

387
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:07,863
also fear me,
Mr. Sobel?

388
00:19:07,865 --> 00:19:10,432
I'd be a fool
not to.

389
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:15,270
Such flattery.

390
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:21,410
Are we done here?

391
00:19:23,347 --> 00:19:25,347
Yeah. We're good.
Take the sniffer and leave.

392
00:19:25,349 --> 00:19:26,915
After you.

393
00:19:36,293 --> 00:19:39,695
It appears that
Mr. Knyazev has returned from the port.

394
00:19:39,697 --> 00:19:44,366
- Join us in 5.
- Absolutely.

395
00:19:44,368 --> 00:19:46,368
- You were amazing.
- Yeah, we'll engrave

396
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:48,036
your Oscar when
you're out of the building.

397
00:19:48,038 --> 00:19:51,473
Phew. Heading out now.

398
00:19:56,614 --> 00:19:58,947
- That's our final offer.
- Oh, please.

399
00:19:58,949 --> 00:20:01,049
Your final offer is
never really final, Sean.

400
00:20:01,051 --> 00:20:02,651
You got a vise
under there?

401
00:20:02,653 --> 00:20:04,853
You want me to just
gently put my nuts in it for you?

402
00:20:04,855 --> 00:20:07,556
So we gonna
celebrate or what?

403
00:20:07,558 --> 00:20:09,358
I think she's gonna drop half
the product

404
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,393
and leave us with our asses
hanging out

405
00:20:11,395 --> 00:20:12,928
- like she did last time.
- I'll make good on my end.

406
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:14,463
You don't need to
worry about me.

407
00:20:14,465 --> 00:20:15,864
I'd take a look
at your own house first.

408
00:20:15,866 --> 00:20:17,633
What the hell
are you talking about?

409
00:20:17,635 --> 00:20:19,501
The Darbinyans rooted
out a mole last month,

410
00:20:19,503 --> 00:20:20,869
an OCB operative.

411
00:20:20,871 --> 00:20:23,505
A few fingernails later,
he got very chatty.

412
00:20:23,507 --> 00:20:26,842
According to him,
you have a cop on your payroll.

413
00:20:35,753 --> 00:20:37,286
Hold up.

414
00:20:37,288 --> 00:20:39,121
Mr. James wants
to see you.

415
00:20:43,294 --> 00:20:44,660
Huh!

416
00:20:47,898 --> 00:20:49,665
Did I teach you
that move?

417
00:20:49,667 --> 00:20:52,000
I taught you
that move.

418
00:20:55,005 --> 00:20:57,673
All right.
Transmitting now.

419
00:20:57,675 --> 00:20:59,808
It's coming through. Man,
this is the mother lode.

420
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:02,077
We're gonna need Alena
on this to help us process.

421
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:03,712
Now get your ass
back to Helix.

422
00:21:03,714 --> 00:21:05,447
On my way.

423
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,020
We need to call
Singh,

424
00:21:12,022 --> 00:21:14,323
roll this thing
up right now.

425
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:20,062
We don't even
have Sonus yet.

426
00:21:20,064 --> 00:21:22,030
We've got enough.

427
00:21:22,032 --> 00:21:23,865
If the Alvarez buy
falls through,

428
00:21:23,867 --> 00:21:26,034
we have got nothing.

429
00:21:26,036 --> 00:21:29,004
Vince, we need
Sonus in the room.

430
00:21:29,006 --> 00:21:30,872
We need money
changing hands.

431
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:33,275
I know,
but what we don't know

432
00:21:33,277 --> 00:21:35,277
is which one of us
is made.

433
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:39,715
Oh, baby. If Sonus
knew anything at all,

434
00:21:39,717 --> 00:21:41,850
one of us would
already be dead.

435
00:21:41,852 --> 00:21:44,353
We've been working
at this for months.

436
00:21:44,355 --> 00:21:49,124
We're close. You know,
we're so close.

437
00:21:49,126 --> 00:21:51,593
Can't pull the pin
on this now.

438
00:21:54,665 --> 00:21:57,132
All right.

439
00:21:57,134 --> 00:21:58,834
We'll play it
your way.

440
00:22:02,906 --> 00:22:04,706
Mr. Sobel.

441
00:22:07,578 --> 00:22:10,879
Sorry. I got a text
from my girlfriend.

442
00:22:10,881 --> 00:22:14,182
She's at the hospital.
Thinks it's appendicitis.

443
00:22:14,184 --> 00:22:17,085
Well, I'm sure the doctors are doing
everything they can.

444
00:22:17,087 --> 00:22:20,355
I need you here for a rather
important assignment.

445
00:22:20,357 --> 00:22:22,758
Yeah? What's that?

446
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,793
Rooting out
a traitor.

447
00:22:35,274 --> 00:22:37,174
Cayden sure has a lot
of junk in his server

448
00:22:37,176 --> 00:22:39,017
for someone who's as
type "A" as you say he is.

449
00:22:39,048 --> 00:22:40,748
Well, brilliant people
are often slobs,

450
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:43,417
or so I tell myself
and my dates.

451
00:22:43,855 --> 00:22:45,421
Show-off. I can't
even get a date.

452
00:22:45,423 --> 00:22:46,923
- Anything yet?
- Well, if by anything, you mean

453
00:22:46,925 --> 00:22:48,257
the location
of the bomb,

454
00:22:48,259 --> 00:22:49,859
no, not yet.

455
00:22:49,861 --> 00:22:53,196
Ok. How much longer is
this gonna take?

456
00:22:53,198 --> 00:22:55,064
Yeah. How much longer
do I got to be here,

457
00:22:55,066 --> 00:22:56,699
because I'm starting
to get PTSD.

458
00:22:56,701 --> 00:22:58,735
- Maybe an hour.
- Hopefully, less.

459
00:22:58,737 --> 00:23:00,236
I'm gonna head
back to Helix.

460
00:23:00,238 --> 00:23:01,718
I should have heard
from Vince by now.

461
00:23:01,966 --> 00:23:03,866
I'll go with you.

462
00:23:07,098 --> 00:23:10,400
Sorry, boys.
Guess I'm just lucky.

463
00:23:10,402 --> 00:23:12,568
More like pretty women
make smart men dumb.

464
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:13,970
Speak for yourself,
Declan.

465
00:23:13,972 --> 00:23:15,938
Hey, Tina. Can I borrow
you for a sec?

466
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:18,274
Yeah. What's up?

467
00:23:18,276 --> 00:23:20,109
I got the Alvarez buy
coming up.

468
00:23:20,111 --> 00:23:21,778
I wanted your expertise
on the numbers.

469
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,146
Yeah. Sure. You want me
to dive in now?

470
00:23:23,148 --> 00:23:24,914
Yeah. You can start
on page 12.

471
00:23:24,916 --> 00:23:26,749
I noticed something
a little concerning.

472
00:23:29,454 --> 00:23:31,921
Looks like your
luck is up.

473
00:23:40,932 --> 00:23:44,667
You were always
the enigma, Mr. Sobel,

474
00:23:44,669 --> 00:23:48,871
the vigilante willing
to ally himself

475
00:23:48,873 --> 00:23:53,075
with criminals to take out
other vigilantes.

476
00:23:53,077 --> 00:23:55,511
I must confess I never
totally bought into it.

477
00:23:55,513 --> 00:23:57,947
Given your background
as an undercover operative,

478
00:23:57,949 --> 00:24:00,016
I would have been
a fool to.

479
00:24:00,018 --> 00:24:02,084
I don't strike you
as a fool, do I?

480
00:24:02,086 --> 00:24:07,790
No. You are coming off
a little crazy, though.

481
00:24:07,792 --> 00:24:10,927
I've done good work
for you.

482
00:24:10,929 --> 00:24:13,596
I got no love for Oliver Queen.
You know that.

483
00:24:13,598 --> 00:24:16,666
I don't know anything
for certain.

484
00:24:16,668 --> 00:24:18,367
That's what this is for.

485
00:24:29,781 --> 00:24:31,614
Unh!

486
00:24:37,355 --> 00:24:40,022
I must admit
that is fascinating.

487
00:24:40,024 --> 00:24:43,893
You can torture me
all you want.

488
00:24:43,895 --> 00:24:48,130
You'll keep getting
the same answer.

489
00:24:48,132 --> 00:24:50,233
I didn't do anything.

490
00:24:50,235 --> 00:24:52,668
I admire your
tenacity,

491
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:55,204
but even a man
who's difficult to kill

492
00:24:55,206 --> 00:24:57,673
cannot withstand
torture, at least not forever.

493
00:24:57,675 --> 00:25:01,077
Hmm. In my country,
we do things a little--

494
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:03,880
how do you say--
dirtier.

495
00:25:03,882 --> 00:25:07,083
We'll give
the two of you some privacy.

496
00:25:11,089 --> 00:25:13,956
Okey-dokey.

497
00:25:21,933 --> 00:25:24,133
Where shall we begin?

498
00:25:29,107 --> 00:25:31,908
Ok, Thea. I'm inside.
Are you sure she's still following?

499
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:34,477
She's right
behind you. Keep moving.

500
00:25:34,479 --> 00:25:36,279
All right.

501
00:25:56,935 --> 00:25:58,634
Laurel.

502
00:25:58,636 --> 00:26:01,370
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Don't--don't go, please.

503
00:26:04,175 --> 00:26:06,943
- This was a mistake.
- If you really thought that,

504
00:26:06,945 --> 00:26:10,580
you wouldn't have
spent the past few nights following me.

505
00:26:10,582 --> 00:26:12,081
I think you want
to talk.

506
00:26:12,083 --> 00:26:13,583
There's nothing
to talk about.

507
00:26:13,585 --> 00:26:18,220
Then don't. Just--
just--just listen

508
00:26:18,222 --> 00:26:20,356
and watch.

509
00:26:23,695 --> 00:26:28,197
You see her?
This is Laurel.

510
00:26:31,235 --> 00:26:34,203
This is my Laurel.

511
00:26:34,205 --> 00:26:36,238
Oh, she was
incredible.

512
00:26:41,212 --> 00:26:44,213
When I look
into your eyes,

513
00:26:44,215 --> 00:26:46,816
I see the girl
I raised.

514
00:26:46,818 --> 00:26:50,252
I see the same
warmth, kindness,

515
00:26:50,254 --> 00:26:52,555
the love,

516
00:26:52,557 --> 00:26:55,658
and I see a hero.

517
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:59,261
You just need to
see it, too.

518
00:26:59,263 --> 00:27:02,231
Please.

519
00:27:02,233 --> 00:27:06,268
This isn't me.
This isn't--this isn't me!

520
00:27:13,244 --> 00:27:15,544
- Are you ok?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

521
00:27:15,546 --> 00:27:17,346
You know, I know it
sounds crazy,

522
00:27:17,348 --> 00:27:19,882
but I think I just saw my daughter
in her eyes.

523
00:27:21,386 --> 00:27:23,352
I saw her.

524
00:27:29,394 --> 00:27:31,260
Vince didn't make it
back to Helix.

525
00:27:31,262 --> 00:27:32,155
Did he reach out
to any of you?

526
00:27:32,156 --> 00:27:33,514
No.

527
00:27:33,514 --> 00:27:35,147
Boom goes the dynamite!

528
00:27:35,149 --> 00:27:36,816
- Oh, yeah!
- Maybe not the best choice

529
00:27:36,818 --> 00:27:38,551
of words considering
the circumstances.

530
00:27:38,553 --> 00:27:40,319
Oh. If by circumstances
you mean locating

531
00:27:40,321 --> 00:27:41,988
Cayden's bomb, then,
yes, we just did.

532
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:43,622
- Where?
- Warehouse district,

533
00:27:43,624 --> 00:27:45,091
10th and Valley.

534
00:27:45,093 --> 00:27:46,692
What exactly are we
walking ourselves into here?

535
00:27:46,694 --> 00:27:48,327
We have no idea.
It's a surveillance dead zone.

536
00:27:48,329 --> 00:27:49,829
- We can't really see a thing.
- No surprise there.

537
00:27:49,831 --> 00:27:50,896
The place is
massive.

538
00:27:50,898 --> 00:27:53,232
Then we need everybody.

539
00:27:53,234 --> 00:27:55,234
Agreed?

540
00:27:59,607 --> 00:28:00,873
- What's that?
- That's Vince.

541
00:28:00,875 --> 00:28:02,608
He just activated
his comms.

542
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:04,844
The pain stops
once I have my answers.

543
00:28:04,846 --> 00:28:07,880
Vince. Oh, my God.
We need to help him.

544
00:28:07,882 --> 00:28:09,749
Hey. Look.
Like Vince said,

545
00:28:09,751 --> 00:28:12,084
James is constantly
moving the bomb.

546
00:28:12,086 --> 00:28:13,652
This might be
our only chance.

547
00:28:13,654 --> 00:28:15,054
He is being tortured.

548
00:28:15,056 --> 00:28:16,722
And he can handle it.

549
00:28:16,724 --> 00:28:18,224
With his healing abilities,
they can't do anything

550
00:28:18,226 --> 00:28:19,725
to hurt him permanently.

551
00:28:19,727 --> 00:28:21,427
As far as we know,
this could be a trap.

552
00:28:21,429 --> 00:28:22,895
Once the bomb
is rendered safe,

553
00:28:22,897 --> 00:28:24,630
we go back in,
we get Vince.

554
00:28:24,632 --> 00:28:26,232
He has already been made.
By the time we get there,

555
00:28:26,234 --> 00:28:27,967
that bomb is gonna be
long gone!

556
00:28:27,969 --> 00:28:31,203
- You don't know that.
- Yes, I do.

557
00:28:31,205 --> 00:28:34,140
Look. We all got
him into this.

558
00:28:34,142 --> 00:28:36,609
We should all
be getting him out!

559
00:28:39,814 --> 00:28:43,916
- Fine. I'll do it myself.
- Dinah.

560
00:28:43,918 --> 00:28:45,951
Vince would not want
you to do it this way.

561
00:28:45,953 --> 00:28:47,553
Don't you dare!

562
00:28:47,555 --> 00:28:49,755
You know damn well
if it was Felicity out there,

563
00:28:49,757 --> 00:28:53,993
if it was Lyla, this wouldn't even
be up for debate.

564
00:28:53,995 --> 00:28:56,796
Vince is my family,

565
00:28:56,798 --> 00:29:00,433
and I am not letting
him die, not again.

566
00:29:06,474 --> 00:29:07,840
Dinah.

567
00:29:07,842 --> 00:29:09,008
You're not talking me
out of this, Curtis.

568
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:10,643
We know.

569
00:29:10,645 --> 00:29:11,944
That's why we're
coming with you.

570
00:29:11,946 --> 00:29:14,046
You're our family, too.

571
00:29:14,048 --> 00:29:16,015
We'll save Vince.

572
00:29:16,017 --> 00:29:17,817
You guys save the city.

573
00:29:19,554 --> 00:29:21,654
We're not gonna be able to cover
the bomb's location

574
00:29:21,656 --> 00:29:23,556
with half
the manpower.

575
00:29:23,558 --> 00:29:25,791
Looks like you're gonna have to figure
out a way, Hoss.

576
00:29:35,497 --> 00:29:37,664
Unh! Arr!

577
00:29:37,666 --> 00:29:39,499
Agh!

578
00:29:43,405 --> 00:29:44,571
How much further?

579
00:29:44,573 --> 00:29:46,373
About 100 yards or so,
give or take.

580
00:29:46,375 --> 00:29:47,908
That might as well
be a mile away at this rate.

581
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:49,176
Not if you draw
their fire.

582
00:29:49,178 --> 00:29:50,844
Follow the T-sphere. Go!

583
00:30:12,201 --> 00:30:13,800
Unh!

584
00:30:25,648 --> 00:30:27,748
Looks like your
little buddy's finally found us.

585
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:30,217
Took longer
than expected.

586
00:30:30,219 --> 00:30:32,819
Good for us.
Bad for him.

587
00:30:36,659 --> 00:30:38,892
No sign of the bomb. You?

588
00:30:45,234 --> 00:30:48,635
Nothing. This place is
too big to search,

589
00:30:48,637 --> 00:30:50,103
and we are gonna
run out of time.

590
00:30:55,444 --> 00:30:59,579
I've got movement,
east corridor.

591
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:03,817
Huh!

592
00:31:10,426 --> 00:31:12,125
Hello, kapiushon.

593
00:31:12,127 --> 00:31:14,328
No need for me to
explain choice here, yes?

594
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:16,430
I thought you were
an honorable man.

595
00:31:16,432 --> 00:31:19,700
I am. Why else
I give you choice?

596
00:31:19,702 --> 00:31:21,835
Find bomb or save--

597
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:30,510
Go. I'll take care
of them.

598
00:31:42,958 --> 00:31:44,624
Vince?

599
00:31:44,626 --> 00:31:47,828
Oh, thank God.

600
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:50,731
Smart work activating
your comms.

601
00:31:50,733 --> 00:31:52,733
I didn't.

602
00:33:02,371 --> 00:33:04,004
Hang on.

603
00:33:04,006 --> 00:33:06,206
- Vince.
- I'll get you free.

604
00:33:06,208 --> 00:33:08,975
Oh, I highly
doubt that.

605
00:33:14,817 --> 00:33:16,950
Ugh.

606
00:33:20,022 --> 00:33:23,156
Your ability to withstand
extreme punishment

607
00:33:23,158 --> 00:33:24,825
is impressive.

608
00:33:26,428 --> 00:33:29,329
But we all have
our limits.

609
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,433
Let's find
Mr. Sobel's.

610
00:33:36,772 --> 00:33:41,908
Don't make me doubt
your loyalty, too, Ms. Lance.

611
00:33:46,882 --> 00:33:51,852
No. No, please.
Please. Please.

612
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:55,822
Don't.

613
00:33:55,824 --> 00:33:58,725
Hey, Tina.

614
00:33:58,727 --> 00:34:00,260
You're not looking
too good,

615
00:34:00,262 --> 00:34:01,962
but I got something here
that might put

616
00:34:01,964 --> 00:34:04,064
a smile on your face.

617
00:34:04,066 --> 00:34:07,667
- Look who we got here.
- Oh, my God.

618
00:34:07,669 --> 00:34:10,203
Vinnie.

619
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,474
I am
begging you.

620
00:34:14,476 --> 00:34:16,409
Please.

621
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:36,563
No.

622
00:35:15,003 --> 00:35:17,237
Oh, my God.

623
00:35:18,206 --> 00:35:19,773
- Hey!
- Dinah!

624
00:35:19,775 --> 00:35:21,875
Hey!

625
00:35:27,916 --> 00:35:34,054
Baby. Baby.
Baby, wake up.

626
00:35:34,056 --> 00:35:38,091
Oh, babe, please.
Baby, please wake up.

627
00:35:38,093 --> 00:35:40,694
- Wake up.
- He's gone, Dd.

628
00:35:43,365 --> 00:35:46,866
No. Oh, my God.

629
00:35:46,868 --> 00:35:51,705
No, baby, not again.
No. Oh, no.

630
00:35:51,707 --> 00:35:53,139
Baby, no.

631
00:36:00,026 --> 00:36:04,162
She hasn't moved
or said a word in over an hour.

632
00:36:04,164 --> 00:36:06,330
After my wife
was murdered,

633
00:36:06,332 --> 00:36:08,166
it took me days.

634
00:36:09,702 --> 00:36:11,536
What do we do?

635
00:36:13,406 --> 00:36:17,241
Nothing. I'm fine.

636
00:36:17,243 --> 00:36:19,277
You're definitely
not fine.

637
00:36:21,414 --> 00:36:24,749
How can we
help you, Dinah?

638
00:36:24,751 --> 00:36:27,785
You already have...

639
00:36:27,787 --> 00:36:29,754
By having my back.

640
00:36:31,691 --> 00:36:33,558
Did they get the bomb?

641
00:36:41,468 --> 00:36:44,268
Tell me.

642
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:46,370
Felicity called.

643
00:36:48,942 --> 00:36:51,442
There was nothing
they could do.

644
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,646
Vince died for nothing.

645
00:37:12,265 --> 00:37:14,832
- I'm sorry.
- We needed more numbers.

646
00:37:14,834 --> 00:37:16,033
We didn't have them.

647
00:37:16,035 --> 00:37:17,535
Any word
from the other team?

648
00:37:17,537 --> 00:37:20,438
I wish it was
better news.

649
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,473
Vince?

650
00:37:22,475 --> 00:37:24,075
He didn't
make it.

651
00:37:27,447 --> 00:37:28,913
How is Dinah?

652
00:37:28,915 --> 00:37:30,481
I'm guessing as
good as she can be.

653
00:37:30,483 --> 00:37:32,316
It was a choice
between an entire city

654
00:37:32,318 --> 00:37:33,484
or one man.

655
00:37:33,486 --> 00:37:35,119
You made
the right call.

656
00:37:35,121 --> 00:37:36,888
I know it feels
like this was all for nothing,

657
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:38,789
but it's not
entirely true.

658
00:37:38,791 --> 00:37:40,491
Alena found
something.

659
00:37:42,395 --> 00:37:44,929
I've been working
on the data haul from Cayden's servers.

660
00:37:44,931 --> 00:37:46,430
Mm-hmm.
What'd you find?

661
00:37:46,432 --> 00:37:48,566
Evidence he received
while in Corto Maltese--

662
00:37:48,568 --> 00:37:50,835
video of his
son's murder.

663
00:37:58,745 --> 00:38:00,444
It's Cayden's son,
Owen Post.

664
00:38:00,446 --> 00:38:01,946
Guess we know why
he hates you so much.

665
00:38:01,948 --> 00:38:04,849
This is fabricated.
It didn't happen.

666
00:38:04,851 --> 00:38:06,350
This could not
have been you.

667
00:38:06,352 --> 00:38:07,785
- You were in Hub City.
- Yeah, but Owen Post

668
00:38:07,787 --> 00:38:09,120
was still murdered
supposedly

669
00:38:09,122 --> 00:38:10,855
by the Green Arrow.

670
00:38:10,857 --> 00:38:12,924
Wouldn't the SCPD be
all over this, the FBI?

671
00:38:12,926 --> 00:38:14,458
Records in the case
were wiped clean.

672
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,427
Right. So Cayden
wanted me all to himself

673
00:38:16,429 --> 00:38:18,663
and didn't want anyone
to get in the way.

674
00:38:18,665 --> 00:38:21,532
How do we prove
that this is fake?

675
00:38:21,534 --> 00:38:22,867
Well, we're working on that,
but there is something

676
00:38:22,869 --> 00:38:24,502
super interesting
about this.

677
00:38:24,504 --> 00:38:26,771
The digital alteration
of this is consistent

678
00:38:26,773 --> 00:38:28,372
with that of the bogus
surveillance photo

679
00:38:28,374 --> 00:38:29,874
of you in
the Green Arrow suit.

680
00:38:29,876 --> 00:38:31,676
We thought Cayden James
leaked that image.

681
00:38:31,678 --> 00:38:33,210
Whoever doctored this
leaked that photo.

682
00:38:33,212 --> 00:38:34,845
To make James think
you killed his son.

683
00:38:34,847 --> 00:38:36,280
Whoever planned this

684
00:38:36,282 --> 00:38:38,015
knew exactly how
Cayden would react.

685
00:38:38,017 --> 00:38:39,584
Which means that person
has to be close to Cayden.

686
00:38:39,586 --> 00:38:41,519
If that's true,

687
00:38:41,521 --> 00:38:44,422
Vince wasn't the only
traitor that Cayden has to worry about.

688
00:38:53,666 --> 00:38:57,568
Hey. You know what?
Laurel--she needs to see this, right,

689
00:38:57,570 --> 00:38:59,337
because the video worked,
it got through to her

690
00:38:59,339 --> 00:39:02,573
a little bit,
but this is gonna--

691
00:39:02,575 --> 00:39:04,408
what is it?
You all right?

692
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:07,511
I think we might have
been wrong about Laurel.

693
00:39:07,513 --> 00:39:10,348
- What are you talking about?
- Felicity just called.

694
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:13,751
Uh, D-Dinah's former
partner, her--her boyfriend...

695
00:39:13,753 --> 00:39:15,586
Right.

696
00:39:15,588 --> 00:39:17,622
- He's dead...
- Ohh.

697
00:39:17,624 --> 00:39:19,624
And, um...

698
00:39:19,626 --> 00:39:22,560
Laurel killed him.

699
00:39:23,963 --> 00:39:27,565
I know how badly
you want to believe in this

700
00:39:27,567 --> 00:39:33,070
and believe in her, and--and seriously,
Quentin, I really do, too.

701
00:39:33,072 --> 00:39:34,939
I'm so sorry.

702
00:40:11,244 --> 00:40:12,910
You shouldn't
be here.

703
00:40:12,912 --> 00:40:14,745
Dinah, please give
me a chance to explain.

704
00:40:14,747 --> 00:40:16,480
You lost that right
when you decided

705
00:40:16,482 --> 00:40:18,649
to leave Vince
on his own to die.

706
00:40:18,651 --> 00:40:22,219
I'm truly sorry
about what happened to Vince

707
00:40:22,221 --> 00:40:24,822
because I know what
he meant to you,

708
00:40:24,824 --> 00:40:26,657
but this was his call,

709
00:40:26,659 --> 00:40:28,826
and he knew what
he signed up for.

710
00:40:30,797 --> 00:40:34,799
Wow. You are really
bad at apologies.

711
00:40:41,174 --> 00:40:43,808
I'm not here
to apologize.

712
00:40:45,144 --> 00:40:46,610
Of course you're not.

713
00:40:46,612 --> 00:40:50,247
I'm here
to explain that

714
00:40:50,249 --> 00:40:52,650
this wasn't
all for nothing.

715
00:40:52,652 --> 00:40:55,186
Felicity's been going through the data that
Vince pulled out,

716
00:40:55,188 --> 00:41:00,825
and for the first time,
Dinah, for the first time,

717
00:41:00,827 --> 00:41:02,727
we have some
viable options.

718
00:41:02,729 --> 00:41:04,995
Viable options?

719
00:41:04,997 --> 00:41:06,664
You know, I used
to tell Vince

720
00:41:06,666 --> 00:41:09,767
his way of seeking
justice wasn't viable.

721
00:41:09,769 --> 00:41:12,703
I convinced him
to change

722
00:41:12,705 --> 00:41:14,972
just how you
convinced me,

723
00:41:14,974 --> 00:41:17,541
but you know
what, Oliver?

724
00:41:19,645 --> 00:41:21,345
Vince was right.

725
00:41:22,682 --> 00:41:25,216
The only way to
bring justice to this city

726
00:41:25,218 --> 00:41:26,884
is with a bullet.

727
00:41:26,886 --> 00:41:30,821
No, Dinah. I need you
to listen to me.

728
00:41:30,823 --> 00:41:35,092
I'm going to make
sure Vince didn't die for nothing.

729
00:41:35,094 --> 00:41:36,727
I'm going to kill

730
00:41:36,729 --> 00:41:38,562
every last one
of them...

731
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:43,067
Starting
with Laurel.
