you'll always be that little umbrella boy.</i>

640
00:37:55,691 --> 00:37:58,778
And if you come after Jim Gordon,
you gotta come after me.

641
00:37:59,487 --> 00:38:01,238
And I still owe you for Fish.

642
00:38:03,574 --> 00:38:06,869
But seriously, this place is amazing.

Give me another drink.

646
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:34,188
JIM: You were very brave.

647
00:38:34,522 --> 00:38:36,232
You helped save the lives
of everyone in here.

648
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,651
Your parents...

649
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:40,194
They would've been proud.

650
00:38:40,361 --> 00:38:41,696
That they would have been.

651
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:45,908
They also would have given me the sack
for letting you do something so idiotic.

652
00:38:47,034 --> 00:38:49,161
It was all of us. We were a team.

653
00:38:50,621 --> 00:38:52,039
Yeah, I guess we were.

654
00:38:53,916 --> 00:38:55,251
Is he okay? (SIGHS)

655
00:38:55,584 --> 00:38:58,254
Fine. Though I'd still like him
to get checked out at the hospital.

656
00:38:58,421 --> 00:38:59,672
Barbara gave him quite a knock.

657
00:39:00,881 --> 00:39:02,049
Any word on her?

658
00:39:02,216 --> 00:39:04,427
I don't know.
She went through a trap door in the stage.

659
00:39:04,593 --> 00:39:07,013
They must have always been planning
to use that as their exit.

660
00:39:08,222 --> 00:39:09,682
Don't worry, we'll find her.

661
00:39:12,351 --> 00:39:14,395
Uh, Mr. Galavan, sir.

Alfred Pennyworth.

663
00:39:16,355 --> 00:39:19,358
I'd just like to thank you for saving
young Master Wayne's life.

664
00:39:19,608 --> 00:39:20,609
Oh.

665
00:39:20,818 --> 00:39:23,404
If there's anything
I can ever do for you, sir.

666
00:39:23,779 --> 00:39:24,780
Or I.

667
00:39:25,197 --> 00:39:29,160
I really just did what any citizen
of Gotham would have done.

668
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:30,745
I wish that were true.

669
00:39:31,287 --> 00:39:32,371
Jim Gordon.

670
00:39:32,913 --> 00:39:34,123
Theo.

671
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:37,334
Well, if you ever need anything,
please call.

672
00:39:38,044 --> 00:39:39,462
We're all in this together, right?

673
00:39:41,255 --> 00:39:42,465
Thank you, sir.

674
00:39:44,008 --> 00:39:47,011
Right, well, I suppose I better be
getting this young man home.

675
00:39:47,178 --> 00:39:49,972
It's been much more of an
exciting evening than originally planned.

676

- I never did like magicians.

Good night.

678

It was very nice meeting you,
Dr. Thompkins.

679
00:39:56,312 --> 00:39:57,396
And you, Bruce.

680
00:39:57,563 --> 00:39:59,690
Good night's sleep,
you'll be right as roses.

681
00:40:02,318 --> 00:40:04,236
I do hope we get to see you again soon.

Alfred.

- You're sure you're okay?
- (SIGHS) I'm fine.
