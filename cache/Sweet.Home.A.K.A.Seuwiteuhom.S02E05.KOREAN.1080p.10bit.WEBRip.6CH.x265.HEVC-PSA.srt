ORIGINAL STORY WEBTOON SWEET HOME
BY CARNBY KIM AND YOUNGCHAN HWANG

2
00:00:56,139 --> 00:01:03,146
SWEET HOME

3
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:22,832
Are you okay?

4
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:24,834
Come here. It's dangerous.

5
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:39,224
What?

6
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:41,184
Are you going to kill him?

7
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,560
He's finally playing nice.

8
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:44,354
Wait over there.

9
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:18,263
Are you Lee Eun-yu?

10
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:20,390
How do you know my name?

11
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,016
They're all gone because of you.

12
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:25,186
They're not harmful.

13
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,064
Hold on--

14
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,409
Stop it.

15
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:41,035
Not her.

16
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,537
Let's go back.

17
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:16,696
Sir.

18
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,913
Monsters will be coming after the noise.

19
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:26,915
Get inside and set off the alarm.

20
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:27,832
Yes, sir.

21
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,209
What about her?

22
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:31,377
Escort her.

23
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,174
To the isolation area.

24
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:37,800
Yes, sir.

25
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:40,595
Let's go, ma'am.

26
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:30,603
Yong-seok disappeared with the radio,
so we can't contact the stadium.

27
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,355
The explosion was pretty loud.

28
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,482
A mine must have gone off
by the outer wall.

29
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:36,734
Can you tell just by the sound?

30
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,987
That's the only thing
that could make such a loud noise.

31
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,460
Sir, Staff Sergeant Lee Dong-jun here.

32
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:55,420
Talk to me.

33
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:58,548
Monsters are on the move
within the range of the scanner.

34
00:04:58,631 --> 00:04:59,716
Where to?

35
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,175
Heading toward the stadium, sir.

36
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:11,728
Seok-chan.

37
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,271
How long to the stadium?

38
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:14,480
At least 15 minutes.

39
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,190
SPORTS COMPLEX, JAMSIL STATION

40
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:17,608
Turn it around.

41
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,277
We're going as far
from the stadium as we can.

42
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,486
Are we running away?

43
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,060
Get ready.

44
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,745
It won't pump gas without electricity.

45
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,290
Doesn't matter. We're not here to fuel up.

46
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,586
Jin-ho.

47
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:42,503
Yes, sir.

48
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,630
Time to put your skills to use.

49
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,824
SAMJEON GAS STATION

50
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:14,994
Where are the monsters?

51
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:23,961
I think they're swarming in already.

52
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,088
Perfect.

53
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:27,715
Let's move!

54
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:05,962
Go.

55
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:52,675
Jin-ho, get ready.

56
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:04,854
What are you waiting for?

57
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,397
Is the trigger not ready?

58
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,566
I think the monsters
are disrupting the signal.

59
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:12,570
Stop here.

60
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,408
-Should we back up?
-No, open the roof.

61
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,962
How long do we have to keep doing this?

62
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,134
We're going to die saving the camp.

63
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:37,094
Could you just shut up and shoot, sir?

64
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,764
Kim is getting more and more reckless.

65
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,282
Turn off the engine.

66
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:28,729
Lift the emergency.

67
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:02,513
What will we do now?

68
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:04,306
What do you mean?

69
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,475
We used up all the C4 we got today.

70
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,353
How are we going to
blow up the monsters now?

71
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:11,522
As long as the stadium is safe.

72
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:13,149
I mean, sure.

73
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,276
But what if the shelter is fine
and we wasted it?

74
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,406
We'll see when we get back.

75
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:56,609
I'm sorry for all the trouble.

76
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:57,776
Don't worry about it.

77
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,704
About Jun-il…

78
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:09,997
I'll look for him.

79
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,457
You'll meet him soon.

80
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,984
Sir, isn't that Oh Jun-il?

81
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,300
I'm sorry about earlier.

82
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,594
About what?

83
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,721
I acted out on my own.

84
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:11,058
I was reckless even after
the landmine was defused.

85
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,142
Why did you do it?

86
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,522
You could've died.

87
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:19,275
I didn't want to…

88
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:21,527
regret it later.

89
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,030
I know what it feels like…

90
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:27,658
to hesitate…

91
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,037
and regret not doing anything.

92
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:39,461
Sir.

93
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,549
Am I dismissed?

94
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:07,156
Attention.

95
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,368
What caused the explosion?

96
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:14,496
There was a runner among the workers.

97
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:17,291
We were trying to defuse
a landmine they stepped on.

98
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:21,170
Who supervised the wall restoration?

99
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:28,761
Private Park Chan-yeong, sir.

100
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:30,262
It was me.

101
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:32,640
That's enough.

102
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,808
-At least no one got hurt.
-What about the runner?

103
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:36,727
Have they been removed?

104
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:40,522
Park Chan-yeong.

105
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,858
They showed symptoms of monsterization,

106
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,693
so we put them in isolation.

107
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:47,196
Isolation?

108
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,864
I insisted on it, sir.

109
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,621
Yeong-hu.

110
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:03,170
You said you'd protect
both the stadium and our men.

111
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,464
I trusted you all along,

112
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:07,007
but look where that got us.

113
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:10,260
Over half of our men
died over the past year!

114
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,727
You protect this place, sir.

115
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,479
I'll protect my men from now on.

116
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,368
Great work, everyone.

117
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:35,452
You may go.

118
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:36,870
Sir.

119
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:39,456
Have you seen Staff Sergeant Choi?

120
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,833
What are you talking about?

121
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,002
There was an incident.

122
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:45,504
He's getting back late.

123
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:49,925
And we found the one
who missed the roll call.

124
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:00,102
RUBBING ALCOHOL

125
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:42,853
No one's here. Get out.

126
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,272
Why are you so angry?

127
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,776
You can get shot for barging in here.

128
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:50,069
It's fine.

129
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,029
I'm going to heaven anyway.

130
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:54,448
And hell wouldn't be
much different from this place.

131
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:58,952
Have you been drinking?

132
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,163
Yes. I had some alcohol.

133
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,831
That's great.

134
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:05,709
I have a tasty little snack
that'd go nicely with it.

135
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:06,627
What is it?

136
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,545
An interesting story.

137
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:11,381
I'm not interested in your stories.

138
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:12,633
I'm a man of science.

139
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,429
Apparently, it was a cleanup operation.

140
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:22,434
Remember when the missiles
blew away the main stadium?

141
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,686
That wasn't a mistake.

142
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,688
The higher-ups had planned it out.

143
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:31,652
With the monsterization epidemic
getting out of control,

144
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:34,613
I heard that they just decided

145
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:37,324
to wipe everyone out.

146
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:40,661
Why does that even matter now?

147
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:44,081
I know it matters to you, doctor.

148
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,836
I'm not trying to get all serious.

149
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:51,797
As I said, it's just an interesting story.

150
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:53,632
It's not.

151
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,968
They didn't kill them all.

152
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,223
They tried to wipe
everybody out but failed.

153
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,268
Isn't that why you guys are alive?

154
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:07,437
And you're living a great life here
thanks to it, aren't you?

155
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,148
I didn't come here to live.

156
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:14,403
Do you want to hear
a really interesting story?

157
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:15,571
Tell me.

158
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:18,615
I'm all ears.

159
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,744
I don't know if you can handle it.

160
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:23,871
Seriously?

161
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:27,040
Why are you being so secretive?

162
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:30,836
You have a lot of time on your hands.
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

163
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:33,422
I mean…

164
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:35,257
Come on, doc.

165
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:38,844
I won't ask for it for free.

166
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,055
I won these from gambling earlier.

167
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:42,973
Get out.

168
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:43,974
It's time for bed.

169
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:47,436
Fine.

170
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,820
Why is the floor so slippery?

171
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:58,947
You'll fall and break your head.

172
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:02,367
Mom.

173
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,246
I need to go to my mom.

174
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,291
That kid…

175
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,168
The kid told me to.

176
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:15,839
I need to go to my mom.

177
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:05,198
Let's see what we have here.

178
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:07,659
Come on, boss.

179
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:08,577
Keep a lookout.

180
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:11,496
You better not pocket anything.

181
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:31,892
What the hell was that?

182
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:32,976
Practice.

183
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:35,062
Bang!

184
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:40,108
Why won't you play along?

185
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:42,652
What?

186
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:46,656
You suck the fun out of everything.

187
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:54,623
Holy crap!

188
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:56,500
Snacks.

189
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:58,043
Spam? No way.

190
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:00,295
Sausage.

191
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,424
Let's go. You can eat when we get back.

192
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:06,009
Just one bite.

193
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,310
We should take this too.

194
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:17,854
We're all out.

195
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,530
Is he still unconscious?

196
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:28,698
Yes.

197
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:30,492
Go ahead and check his eyes.

198
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:37,374
Are his eyes out of focus?

199
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:38,875
No.

200
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:40,669
Check if he has any scars.

201
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:43,547
Search every nook and cranny.

202
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:46,967
If he has an open wound,
give him a shot of antibiotics.

203
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:06,611
What's this?

204
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:11,408
He has a wound on his arm,
but it looks strange.

205
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:13,285
Come on, man.

206
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:18,999
What the hell?

207
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:21,334
You look worse than he does.

208
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,295
I'm fine.

209
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:31,636
What's this?

210
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:35,140
This isn't a burn or a bruise.

211
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:38,059
Any chronic conditions?

212
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:40,145
I'm not sure.

213
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:41,688
Doesn't he have family?

214
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:43,523
Well…

215
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:48,737
So his mom is the one who's been isolated.

216
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,988
Let's talk somewhere else.

217
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:51,781
Why? He'll find out anyway.

218
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:53,909
But still…

219
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:56,494
I don't think he'll die, so don't worry.

220
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:58,496
-Mom.
-I'll keep him here

221
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:00,749
just in case.

222
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:06,463
Don't just stand there. Get back to work.

223
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:07,881
Standing here won't heal him.

224
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:13,887
Doctor.

225
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:17,891
Can monsters choose who to attack?

226
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:20,435
Type Greens can.

227
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,648
But they can't tell humans apart.

228
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:28,068
It just seems that way
because they aren't aggressive.

229
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:29,486
What if it only attacked

230
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:31,821
one out of two people?

231
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:36,076
Did you see something

232
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:38,787
or are you just asking out of curiosity?

233
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,164
-Does that change the answer?
-Monsterization…

234
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:45,710
is a mental illness.

235
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,130
Well, technically, they're different.

236
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:52,217
But in a general sense,
they're not so different.

237
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:54,678
It gets you engulfed by your own desires

238
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:57,681
and traps you in the world
that your mind created.

239
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:00,350
It's a special type of mental illness

240
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:02,602
that leads to physical metamorphosis.

241
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:04,020
So…

242
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:08,942
do you think these blind creatures
have love and friendship left in them?

243
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:11,361
Right.

244
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:13,405
Whatever it was that you saw,

245
00:26:14,572 --> 00:26:15,949
I'm sure it was a coincidence.

246
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,994
Okay. Please take good care of him.

247
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:24,165
Private Park.

248
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:28,628
Next time you see it, let me know.

249
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:30,463
The monster that you saw.

250
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:32,966
Could it have been
trying to protect the person?

251
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:36,094
Anyway, that odd monster
that chooses its targets.

252
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,305
Even better if you capture it.

253
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:39,389
Who knows?

254
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,519
It may help us solve
the mystery of monsterization.

255
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:11,296
I must be mistaken.

256
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:14,591
A monster protecting humans?

257
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:19,596
Say you're sorry.

258
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,806
Say you're sorry!

259
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:23,433
What do you mean?

260
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,561
I told you to come back.

261
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,481
I told you it was dangerous out there.

262
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:31,733
I told you to come back!

263
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:35,278
And what happened to your face?

264
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:37,447
Who did this to you?

265
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:38,782
Was it a monster?

266
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:40,367
It's nothing.

267
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:42,827
Do you see this?

268
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,829
I couldn't wipe off the dye in time
because I was so worried

269
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:46,164
and now my hair's gone to shit.

270
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:49,334
How am I supposed to go on

271
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:53,171
if something happens to you?

272
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:54,422
What?

273
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:57,717
What do you mean? You'll be just fine.

274
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:05,725
Never mind.

275
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:12,649
I'll talk to you again
when my hair's the right color.

276
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:16,069
And put some medicine on your face.

277
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:25,995
May I help you?

278
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,122
ELECTRICAL ROOM

279
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:32,419
The symptomatic lady.

280
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,004
Please kick her out immediately.

281
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,257
What's the rush?

282
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:40,218
You must have
more urgent matters to attend to.

283
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,638
Do you think everything's fine

284
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,182
because she's the first one
we've had in a month

285
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:47,684
out of hundreds of people here?

286
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:49,728
People won't think that way.

287
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:51,563
They always imagine the worst.

288
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:54,858
Monsterization isn't contagious?

289
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:56,151
Well, you're wrong.

290
00:28:56,776 --> 00:29:00,947
It spreads through fear and anxiety.

291
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,368
So nip it in the bud.

292
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:08,288
That's your job.

293
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:09,289
Anyone…

294
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:12,500
could be that bud,

295
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:13,960
including you and me.

296
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:15,628
What are you trying to say?

297
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,924
The "worst" that the people imagine.

298
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:23,303
Do you think it's the monsters

299
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:25,847
or the fact that they might turn into one?

300
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,267
For as long as we've guarded this place,

301
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,936
no one has been killed by a monster
that emerged from the inside.

302
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,731
But many have left of their own volition.

303
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:38,026
I'm not being compassionate
toward the symptomatic.

304
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:40,737
I'm trying to give hope to the survivors.

305
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,363
I want to show them

306
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:44,699
that they can make their own choices
even if they turn.

307
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:47,869
What good is hope in a world like this?

308
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,665
We need something to hang onto.

309
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:58,630
I'm sure you have one too.

310
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:02,842
A silver lining
that no one else knows about.

311
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:07,555
If things go south…

312
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:12,477
you will have to
take responsibility for it.

313
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:14,312
Will do.

314
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:02,402
Have a seat.

315
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:06,739
How do I never have any visitors?

316
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:09,701
How is that my fault?

317
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:14,289
Your brooding face
is driving business to the ground.

318
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:15,623
Business was never good.

319
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:21,546
Maybe I should find a new line of work.

320
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,844
Or should I find a new employee?

321
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:34,058
You have to earn your drugs.

322
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:36,853
Don't gloat.

323
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:38,229
This won't cure me.

324
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:40,189
It's the best you can get around here.

325
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:43,192
At least take these antibiotics regularly.

326
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:45,486
I can't be bothered to hire someone new.

327
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:47,947
Father Peter.

328
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:52,660
We have a testimony meeting today, right?

329
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:53,870
-Yes.
-Okay.

330
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:57,040
I heard these meetings
could even cure someone with symptoms.

331
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:59,417
-That's right.
-This lady suggested that we come.

332
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:02,712
You're right on time.

333
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:27,445
Have you lost your mind?

334
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:29,238
Let go! Damn it.

335
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:31,824
I was saving this
for the day I ask him out.

336
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:35,578
Seriously.

337
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:41,501
You must be comfortable here.

338
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:43,836
-Look at this drawing.
-Give it back.

339
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:49,634
-Isn't that Father Peter?
-No.

340
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,970
Yeah, it is.

341
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:54,555
Long hair, black clothes
with the white thing around his neck…

342
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:55,890
It's him for sure.

343
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:58,226
Hold on.

344
00:32:58,726 --> 00:32:59,978
Are you into him?

345
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:01,646
What?

346
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:06,067
Hey, where are we going?

347
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:09,362
I should still be thankful.

348
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:11,197
If it weren't for this place,

349
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,866
I would have died trembling out there.

350
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:16,661
I have a floor to lie down on

351
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:19,205
and a roof to keep me from the rain.

352
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:22,583
I even have my child with me.

353
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,377
It'd be wrong to ask for more.

354
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,337
What a load of shit.

355
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:27,839
Brother.

356
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:30,800
Give me that.

357
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:32,802
Hey.

358
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:34,762
You said we had to be honest here.

359
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,806
You call that honesty? She's full of it.

360
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:40,393
If you keep bottling everything up
and only saying nice things,

361
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:42,562
you'll just end up like Jun-il's mom.

362
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:45,023
Why don't you start us off then?

363
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:51,738
You'll become a monster
if you keep bottling it up.

364
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:52,905
So let it out.

365
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:56,826
Think about everyone
who's been to these meetings.

366
00:33:57,618 --> 00:33:58,786
They're all still human.

367
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:01,205
Do you get it?

368
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:03,583
I want to go next.

369
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:08,504
I haven't said this to anyone.

370
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,048
But I'm happy these days.

371
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:12,967
All I have to do is eat.

372
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:15,011
And then I go to sleep.

373
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:18,097
No one is better or worse off than others.

374
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:19,932
Let's end the testimony meeting here.

375
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:22,852
I want to confess too.
I think I like you, Father.

376
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:26,230
No.

377
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,733
I do like you.

378
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:33,654
You can't just blurt it out.

379
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:35,782
I hope you'll be happy together.

380
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:37,700
What a sight, jeez.

381
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,578
Aren't you coming?

382
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:41,871
Don't listen to that crap.

383
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:44,624
-It's not the Father's fault.
-Let's go.

384
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,423
Father.

385
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:54,634
Can I ask you a favor?

386
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:56,928
Sure, what is it?

387
00:34:57,553 --> 00:34:59,263
It's about Jun-il's mom.

388
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,141
Would you mind paying her a visit?

389
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:05,478
You can leave the premises
with permission.

390
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:07,897
That might cost you a bit.

391
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,316
I see.

392
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:14,237
But I'll just call it pro bono.

393
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:19,075
Come in.

394
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:32,922
I'll go search
for Staff Sergeant Choi at sunrise.

395
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:36,384
You think that's what Yong-seok wants?

396
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:41,305
How do you feel
about being a soldier here?

397
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,934
Are you saying
he left of his own volition?

398
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,520
We can't be certain he didn't.

399
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:49,522
That doesn't change anything.

400
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:51,691
I'll go find him.

401
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:53,484
-I won't allow it.
-Sir.

402
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:56,320
We can't put everyone at risk
for his sake.

403
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:59,365
You went through so much trouble
for a symptomatic individual.

404
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:02,493
But you're so quick
to abandon your subordinate.

405
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:03,411
No.

406
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:05,955
I'm trying to protect you guys.

407
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:08,166
I don't trust those words anymore.

408
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:15,548
What is the Platoon to you?

409
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:26,684
These men risk their lives
to go out there.

410
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:30,479
The honor and dignity of the Platoon?

411
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:35,443
What good is that when we're all dead?

412
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:37,111
That's why I can't let you go.

413
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:40,781
You want to go find Yong-seok?

414
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,241
Is everyone on board?

415
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:46,495
I'm asking if the whole Platoon
wants to go look for him.

416
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,042
How many men have died

417
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:53,044
due to your recklessness?

418
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:56,881
Sergeant Kim.

419
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:58,758
I hope you'll be

420
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,260
different from me.

421
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:09,018
You've become a coward, sir.

422
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:38,381
Is this even edible?

423
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:39,715
You don't have to eat it, sir.

424
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:41,342
This is the best we can get.

425
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:43,261
This is what I get for risking my life?

426
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:46,222
I only enlisted
so I could get regular meals.

427
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:47,390
This is a letdown.

428
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:52,311
Hey, Jin-ho.

429
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:53,938
No signal yet?

430
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:55,815
No, sir.

431
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:58,192
Maybe it's because we're underground.

432
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:01,112
Should I take it upstairs?

433
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:04,115
I installed a repeater,
so the signal should come through.

434
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:13,582
You enjoying that?

435
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:17,003
How can you eat right now?

436
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:23,968
Yong-seok deserted us.

437
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:29,181
Watch your damn mouth.

438
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:32,435
Marines have dignity.

439
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:34,812
I'm not disagreeing with you, sir.

440
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:37,273
But you were always pulling pranks on him.

441
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:39,025
Have you seen Yong-seok these days?

442
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:42,236
He always had
this gloomy look on his face.

443
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,155
He was bound to run away.

444
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:45,698
Even so, Yong-seok…

445
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:49,493
wouldn't do that.

446
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,537
He knows how dangerous it is out there.

447
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:57,543
Maybe Yong-seok
was going through monsterization.

448
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:58,878
And he didn't want to--

449
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:02,340
You piece of shit.

450
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:04,050
I told you to watch your mouth.

451
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,135
Did you just hit me?

452
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:07,428
You think you're tough?

453
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:12,308
-You wanna go, man to man?
-Back off, sir.

454
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,894
Stay out of it, you motherfucker.

455
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:19,231
That's enough.

456
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:24,528
Don't take it any further.

457
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:57,353
ANTIBIOTICS

458
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,434
You stole my brother's baseball,
didn't you?

459
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:38,936
Why would I steal his
when there are balls everywhere?

460
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:40,312
That torn baseball.

461
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:42,940
My brother wants it.

462
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:44,650
So hand it over.

463
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:46,026
This is mine.

464
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,736
Nothing here is yours.

465
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,864
-Says who?
-My dad.

466
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:51,031
Hey.

467
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,783
I heard your sister's a bitch.

468
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,827
Then you're a bitch's brother.

469
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:57,246
So you don't have the right
to own anything.

470
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:03,961
He's a monster. A thieving monster.

471
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:13,471
Stop it!

472
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:15,306
Stop it!

473
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:17,475
Stop!

474
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:20,603
-Get off him.
-Let go!

475
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:21,645
Get off him.

476
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:23,063
Get out of here, both of you.

477
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:25,107
Now!

478
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:27,026
You better watch out.

479
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:30,070
Let go!

480
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:33,949
What was that?

481
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:36,160
What are you, a thug?

482
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:38,662
Would you rather I let them
have their way like you do?

483
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:41,540
-Kim Yeong-su.
-They say it's your own fault

484
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:43,334
if you get beaten or stolen from.

485
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:45,211
That's the world we live in.

486
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,339
You should just kill everyone too.

487
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:50,132
Don't let them have their way.

488
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:52,092
-Kim Yeong-su.
-That's what I'm going to do.

489
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:56,680
When you hurt others…

490
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:00,643
it all comes back to you.

491
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:02,436
Really? Is that so?

492
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,647
-Yes.
-So why am I in pain?

493
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:07,024
I was good just like Dad told me to be.

494
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:10,152
Why did everyone around me die
when I didn't do anything wrong?

495
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:11,529
Why am I the only one left?

496
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:14,990
I don't trust grown-ups anymore.

497
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:17,243
So you should live however you want.

498
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:19,662
I'll do the same.

499
00:42:57,908 --> 00:42:58,909
What the hell?

500
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:05,082
Oh Jun-il.

501
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:09,587
What did you…

502
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:15,092
Where did he go?

503
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:21,682
Are you sure?

504
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:24,685
Didn't you hear her?

505
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:26,478
She said she was.

506
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:28,814
Have you lost your mind?

507
00:43:28,897 --> 00:43:30,482
We can't be too cautious.

508
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:32,484
He's got a nosebleed, for crying out loud.

509
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:34,236
God damn it.

510
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,821
What did you do?

511
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:39,283
Happy?

512
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:41,535
See?

513
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:42,620
Are you satisfied?

514
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:44,413
You didn't have to take it so far.

515
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:45,914
You crazy little brat.

516
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:51,295
Mom.

517
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:54,923
Mom, I'm home.

518
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:57,384
I went outside and…

519
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:07,561
Mom, where…

520
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:11,065
Yeong-su.

521
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:13,359
Where's my mom?

522
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:15,152
She turned into a monster.

523
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:16,487
What?

524
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:19,239
She had a nosebleed
and turned into a monster!

525
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:21,867
Will she not die then?

526
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:25,287
No, she will.

527
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:28,290
People will kill her.

528
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:53,232
What brings you
all the way out here, Father?

529
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:55,651
I thought I'd do my part for once.

530
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:57,653
If you have a confession to make,
go ahead.

531
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:09,915
I thought I was really going to die

532
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:11,917
when I saw you coming.

533
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,670
Technically, you aren't dying.

534
00:45:14,753 --> 00:45:16,380
It's harder for you to die now.

535
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:18,674
It's much easier to die as a human.

536
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:20,467
You're right.

537
00:45:22,177 --> 00:45:23,804
I don't have anything to confess,

538
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:26,140
but I just wanted to ask.

539
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:29,268
I can't give you an answer.
I'll just listen.

540
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:32,187
What grave sin
could I have committed to deserve this?

541
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:34,189
Everyone commits sins.

542
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:35,858
You just got unlucky.

543
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:40,070
How can God be so cruel until the end?

544
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:42,990
I never even wanted much in life.

545
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:47,161
So why is he pushing me
into the corner like this?

546
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:48,662
Ask when you see him.

547
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:52,374
Ask him why he let all of this happen.

548
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:55,419
I'd like to know as well.

549
00:45:57,212 --> 00:46:01,258
I actually asked the monster
the same question.

550
00:46:02,217 --> 00:46:03,218
I said,

551
00:46:03,802 --> 00:46:06,555
"Monster, please give me an answer."

552
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:07,598
What did it say?

553
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:11,643
I mean, I couldn't hear anything.

554
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:14,980
The monster didn't talk.

555
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:17,191
Everyone else says
the monsters talk to them,

556
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:19,943
so why doesn't mine speak to me?

557
00:46:20,527 --> 00:46:23,572
Both God and the monster
just want to torture me!

558
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:25,908
The one that really tortures us…

559
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:29,161
isn't God or a monster.

560
00:46:30,245 --> 00:46:32,414
It's the person closest to us.

561
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:36,210
That person is your God and monster.

562
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:38,795
For you, it was your son.

563
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:41,298
He was your God

564
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:43,967
and your monster.

565
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:45,802
But I still…

566
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:49,515
I still wanted to be with him.

567
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:00,609
Mom…

568
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:02,653
I want to go see Mom.

569
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:04,696
Didn't you get caught
sneaking out in the morning?

570
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,116
Can't you see I'm on night watch
because of you?

571
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,868
I'm warning you. Get lost.

572
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:14,331
Let me see my mom.

573
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:18,210
I want to go out!

574
00:47:18,293 --> 00:47:20,337
-Hey!
-Why won't this open?

575
00:47:20,837 --> 00:47:21,672
Hey!

576
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:24,383
-You little…
-Stop it.

577
00:47:24,466 --> 00:47:25,509
Stop it.

578
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:27,594
-Well…
-I want to go.

579
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:29,012
I hate this.

580
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:30,097
What do you mean?

581
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,640
Your barbaric ways

582
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:34,309
of resorting to violence all the time.

583
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:36,019
He's my patient.

584
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:37,271
Didn't you know?

585
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:38,689
How would I?

586
00:47:38,772 --> 00:47:41,775
Ignorance is not a crime,
so I'll let it slide this time.

587
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:45,529
But next time, go easy on him.

588
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:49,866
He might be more valuable than you.

589
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:51,034
Let go.

590
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:51,952
Let go.

591
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:54,538
-I want to go out.
-Come here. Are you okay?

592
00:47:54,621 --> 00:47:56,456
-Come here. Let's go.
-Mom…

593
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,625
-Your mom isn't there. Follow me.
-Where's Mom?

594
00:47:58,709 --> 00:47:59,793
Let's go this way.

595
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:04,131
Are you feeling okay?

596
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:07,884
Are you hearing things at all?

597
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:10,887
What happened outside? Who did you meet?

598
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:14,391
Did you touch anything
or get bitten by anything?

599
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:15,684
Never mind, it's not contagious.

600
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:17,853
-What happened out there?
-Mom.

601
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:20,689
Mom is a monster?

602
00:48:20,772 --> 00:48:21,607
What?

603
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:24,359
I have to go to Mom.

604
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:26,069
-Hey, keep it together.
-I need to go to her.

605
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:27,654
-What? Mom?
-Where's Mom?

606
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:30,991
Mom? So you want to go to your mom.

607
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:34,786
I'll take you to her.

608
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:38,832
Really?

609
00:48:38,915 --> 00:48:40,792
But before I do, we have to talk.

610
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:42,753
About what?

611
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:44,755
How did you get this?

612
00:48:45,672 --> 00:48:46,840
Don't you remember?

613
00:48:58,769 --> 00:48:59,895
A kid.

614
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:01,188
What?

615
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:03,148
There was a kid…

616
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:07,027
where there were flowers

617
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:10,155
and trees.

618
00:49:10,238 --> 00:49:12,532
It was a girl.

619
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:15,327
She pushed.

620
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:17,412
Can you say that again?

621
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:19,331
-A kid and flowers?
-I don't know.

622
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:22,417
I have to go to Mom now.

623
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:23,835
Think.

624
00:49:24,419 --> 00:49:25,671
Remember it.

625
00:50:34,906 --> 00:50:36,700
What's the point now?

626
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:45,667
Chief Ji.

627
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:47,711
Life is a funny thing.

628
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:53,008
I'm finally all better
now that I'm a monster.

629
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:53,925
Look.

630
00:50:58,013 --> 00:50:59,723
I got my teeth back.

631
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:04,478
About what I told you earlier.

632
00:51:06,772 --> 00:51:10,025
Have you made up your mind?

633
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:10,942
Yes.

634
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:14,488
I'm leaving tomorrow.

635
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,408
Wise choice.

636
00:51:19,075 --> 00:51:22,287
I'll help you when you leave tomorrow.

637
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:23,497
What?

638
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:24,414
How?

639
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:28,084
Will you let me see Jun-il?

640
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:29,085
Sure.

641
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:34,508
B2 SURVIVOR COUNT
TOTAL: 432, DEAD: 31, ALIVE: 401

642
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:39,554
B2 SURVIVORS

TOTAL: 60, DEAD: 32, ALIVE: 28

644
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:03,578
CHOI YONG-SEOK, STAFF SERGEANT

645
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:08,583
You're still up.

646
00:52:12,045 --> 00:52:13,213
I couldn't sleep.

647
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:18,218
So? What's up?

648
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:20,345
It's about Yong-seok.

649
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:23,390
He's been seeing someone.

650
00:52:25,183 --> 00:52:27,978
And she's quite ill.

651
00:52:29,729 --> 00:52:31,606
Yong-seok said he'll make sure…

652
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:34,818
that she lives.

653
00:52:36,945 --> 00:52:39,072
I think he went to a hospital…

654
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:44,119
or a pharmacy.

655
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:46,580
Who's the woman?

656
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:44,971
Why are you getting in the way?

657
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:46,723
Just doing what I gotta do.

658
00:53:46,806 --> 00:53:48,850
I tend to get misunderstood pretty often.

659
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:52,812
If you die here,
people are going to point fingers at me.

660
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:54,814
Don't stop me.

661
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:57,984
Then don't bother me
and die somewhere I can't see you.

662
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:12,332
You should eat before you die.

663
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:35,605
REST IN PEACE

664
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:49,911
Do Sang-jin.

665
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:54,416
Everyone dies
when they get involved with you.

666
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:58,503
So stop getting people to tail me.

667
00:54:58,586 --> 00:54:59,754
Will I die soon as well?

668
00:55:02,298 --> 00:55:03,425
I thought you'd know.

669
00:55:05,885 --> 00:55:07,429
I might not come back for a while.

670
00:55:07,512 --> 00:55:09,055
You said you'd make up
for killing my husband.

671
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:11,266
I never said I killed him.

672
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:15,562
That doesn't matter anymore.

673
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:19,441
I used to want to kill you.

674
00:55:19,524 --> 00:55:20,734
But I can only decide

675
00:55:21,276 --> 00:55:23,528
whether to take revenge or forgive you

676
00:55:23,611 --> 00:55:25,905
if you play innocent
or beg for forgiveness.

677
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:27,323
But you did neither.

678
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:28,992
So have you decided now?

679
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:31,244
Yeah.

680
00:55:32,871 --> 00:55:33,872
I'm going to wait

681
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:36,207
for the moment…

682
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:39,169
you turn into a monster.

683
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:44,466
I can't forgive you
because I want to kill you.

684
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:46,468
But I can't kill you

685
00:55:46,968 --> 00:55:49,262
because I don't want to be
a murderer like you.

686
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:51,473
I'll kill you with my own hands

687
00:55:51,556 --> 00:55:52,891
when you turn into a monster.

688
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:55,185
So don't die out there.

689
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:57,687
I'd be very disappointed.

690
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:20,752
You must be on patrol duty.

691
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:22,587
Thank you for your service.

692
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:28,259
Why did Jun-il act like that earlier?

693
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:29,969
Is he okay?

694
00:56:30,845 --> 00:56:31,846
It was nothing.

695
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:34,349
Well, that's a relief.

696
00:56:35,266 --> 00:56:36,267
I saw him

697
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:39,020
following Lee Eun-yu in the morning.

698
00:56:42,107 --> 00:56:43,858
Along with Do Sang-jin and An Dong-gi.

699
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:45,193
The three of them.

700
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:48,071
Are you sure?

701
00:56:52,617 --> 00:56:54,410
I swear on his name.

702
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:57,747
But I don't see the other two.

703
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:37,203
This is all I have today.

704
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:39,664
I gave the can to someone else.

705
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:52,051
Going out again?

706
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:55,138
Are you stalking me?

707
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:56,848
You must enjoy the thrill.

708
00:57:59,934 --> 00:58:01,644
Are you talking about yourself?

709
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:03,771
I see you got your ass beaten again.

710
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:06,608
Would you look at your face
before you start talking?

711
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:08,860
Mind your own business.

712
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:11,446
Stop acting on your own.

713
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:16,159
You're putting yourself
and this whole place in danger.

714
00:58:16,242 --> 00:58:17,327
Guess what?

715
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:19,787
These cats are risking their lives
to come and eat this.

716
00:58:19,871 --> 00:58:22,248
Even cats know
that you need to risk your life

717
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:24,083
to get what you want.

718
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:40,350
I've seen that red ribbon before.

719
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:44,354
Don't be curious and stop stalking me.

720
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:46,481
You might end up dying.

721
00:58:46,564 --> 00:58:47,815
Is that why you killed

722
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:50,109
Do Sang-jin and An Dong-gi?

723
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:51,361
You want to know how they died?

724
00:58:51,444 --> 00:58:53,404
It was that person again, right?

725
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:54,864
The person you're looking for.

726
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:57,784
Or is it a monster?

727
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:01,454
On the night of the incident,

728
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:05,124
Chief Ji's husband died, but you survived.

729
00:59:07,001 --> 00:59:09,003
Monsters choosing their targets?

730
00:59:10,296 --> 00:59:11,965
That's impossible.

731
00:59:12,757 --> 00:59:13,841
Plus…

732
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:17,470
that red ribbon that you have…

733
00:59:19,097 --> 00:59:20,557
What the hell are you talking about?

734
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,517
That monster is protecting you, right?

735
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,310
And you're looking for it.

736
00:59:25,186 --> 00:59:26,187
Right?

737
00:59:44,122 --> 00:59:46,374
You're that kid from before.

738
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:49,836
Have you met him yet?

739
00:59:51,129 --> 00:59:52,297
Who the hell are you?

740
00:59:53,214 --> 00:59:54,549
How do you know me?

741
00:59:58,303 --> 00:59:59,804
Did he tell you?

742
00:59:59,887 --> 01:00:00,847
Where…

743
01:00:02,807 --> 01:00:04,392
where is he right now?

744
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:06,019
You want to know?

745
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:12,442
Why don't you come with me then?

746
01:00:16,946 --> 01:00:19,198
Data number 23.

747
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:22,035
The blood extracted from Oh Jun-il

748
01:00:22,744 --> 01:00:24,829
was very similar to that of a monster,

749
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:28,958
but he hasn't displayed
any kind of symptoms.

750
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:40,720
Despite having the possibility
of monsterization,

751
01:00:41,262 --> 01:00:42,597
he has no symptoms.

752
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:51,022
He was only outside for a few hours.

753
01:00:51,105 --> 01:00:55,902
I have to find out what happened
within those few hours.

754
01:00:57,987 --> 01:00:59,447
Currently,

755
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:04,410
I am planning to expose the subject
to a valid stimulant that may evoke

756
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:06,829
his monsterization.

757
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:11,793
Oh Jun-il.

758
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:13,920
Oh Jun-il.

759
01:01:19,967 --> 01:01:21,302
It's time to go see your mom.

760
01:01:37,985 --> 01:01:38,820
Stand back.

761
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:40,363
She's not alone.

762
01:02:02,468 --> 01:02:03,678
I'm not going to shoot.

763
01:02:06,931 --> 01:02:08,391
I'll just take the kid.

764
01:02:16,691 --> 01:02:17,817
She was alive.
