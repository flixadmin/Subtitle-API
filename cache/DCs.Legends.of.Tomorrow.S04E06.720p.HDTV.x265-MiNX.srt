1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,508
Previously on "Legends of Tomorrow"...

2
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:02,796
That's my dad. This must be one

3
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:04,047
of his secret government projects

4
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:05,782
- he could never tell me about.
- Yeah, my whole life,

5
00:00:05,784 --> 00:00:08,210
I always believed my power was evil.

6
00:00:08,213 --> 00:00:09,507
Nora Darhk, hands up!

7
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,143
It's time for me to pay for my past.

8
00:00:11,146 --> 00:00:12,713
I just believe she
can be a better person.

9
00:00:12,715 --> 00:00:15,007
- Amaya.
- It just looks like her.

10
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:16,273
She's a shape-shifter.

11
00:00:16,276 --> 00:00:17,982
She's still adjusting to her knew home.

12
00:00:17,985 --> 00:00:19,479
I'm gonna green-light additional funding

13
00:00:19,481 --> 00:00:21,834
to fast-track the completion
of your containment facility.

14
00:00:21,837 --> 00:00:23,632
Is that a Kaupe?

15
00:00:23,635 --> 00:00:25,786
I can't believe you guys
have magical creatures here.

16
00:00:25,789 --> 00:00:28,062
This is, like, the coolest place ever.

17
00:00:34,893 --> 00:00:36,559
Hey, Ava, hope I'm not too early.

18
00:00:36,562 --> 00:00:37,750
It's Director Sharpe.

19
00:00:37,752 --> 00:00:39,449
And you're not early, Mona. You're late.

20
00:00:39,452 --> 00:00:42,145
Oh, no, are you firing me?
Why does this always happen?

21
00:00:42,148 --> 00:00:43,822
I'm not firing you, Mona.

22
00:00:43,824 --> 00:00:47,192
Awesome, because I cannot
wait to decorate my cubicle.

23
00:00:47,194 --> 00:00:48,927
There's Rose from "Golden Girls."

24
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:50,996
She's, like, the OG of girl power.

25
00:00:50,998 --> 00:00:52,398
- Am I right?
- No.

26
00:00:52,401 --> 00:00:54,033
Take that off and
anything else that's metal.

27
00:00:54,035 --> 00:00:55,040
Leave the toys with these guys.

28
00:00:55,042 --> 00:00:56,015
You do not want to bring anything

29
00:00:56,017 --> 00:00:57,417
into the containment
unit that can be used

30
00:00:57,419 --> 00:00:59,303
as a weapon against you.

31
00:00:59,306 --> 00:01:02,307
But Rose couldn't hurt a fly.

32
00:01:05,613 --> 00:01:08,514
Your job is to feed our
various magical detainees.

33
00:01:08,516 --> 00:01:09,982
Keeping these creatures secure

34
00:01:09,984 --> 00:01:12,785
is the Bureau's newest
and highest priority.

35
00:01:15,022 --> 00:01:17,342
Aloha, Kaupe.

36
00:01:17,345 --> 00:01:18,657
Good to see you.

37
00:01:24,198 --> 00:01:25,764
Each cell is encoded

38
00:01:25,766 --> 00:01:27,655
with the captive's genetic signature,

39
00:01:27,658 --> 00:01:29,334
allowing you to pass them provisions

40
00:01:29,336 --> 00:01:32,571
all while keeping you
safe from the monsters.

41
00:01:32,573 --> 00:01:35,674
Well, this place
definitely needs decorating.

42
00:01:35,676 --> 00:01:38,377
Now, for the Kaupe, we're
gonna need a palm tree,

43
00:01:38,379 --> 00:01:41,046
- some volcanic rock...
- This is a prison, Mona,

44
00:01:41,048 --> 00:01:42,319
not a home.

45
00:01:42,322 --> 00:01:44,449
Let's go.

46
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:50,155
And they are our
prisoners, not our friends.

47
00:01:50,157 --> 00:01:53,592
Which is especially true of
our most recent acquisition.

48
00:01:59,925 --> 00:02:01,389
Nora Darhk.

49
00:02:01,392 --> 00:02:04,202
Of all the creatures here,
she's the most despicable.

50
00:02:04,205 --> 00:02:06,905
Hi, I'm Mona.

51
00:02:06,907 --> 00:02:08,474
I'm your magical caretaker.

52
00:02:08,476 --> 00:02:11,710
So if you have any dietary restrictions

53
00:02:11,712 --> 00:02:15,347
or special requests,
be sure to let me know.

54
00:02:15,349 --> 00:02:17,416
Um...

55
00:02:17,418 --> 00:02:19,084
you should have this.

56
00:02:19,086 --> 00:02:22,154
It just came out. It's
called "Uncaged Desire."

57
00:02:28,529 --> 00:02:32,331
Actually, there is something
you can get me, Mona.

58
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:36,068
Anything, just... You name it.

59
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:40,239
Some peace... and quiet.

60
00:02:40,241 --> 00:02:41,507
Hmm?

61
00:02:47,414 --> 00:02:50,949
I think you just learned a
very valuable lesson, Mona.

62
00:02:52,485 --> 00:02:55,419
Don't fraternize with the prisoners.

63
00:03:02,897 --> 00:03:05,697
I told you, no interrup...

64
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:11,703
Well, you're not Gary.

65
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,239
Perceptive.

66
00:03:14,241 --> 00:03:16,949
And those are not work shoes.

67
00:03:16,952 --> 00:03:18,577
What are you doing here?

68
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:21,780
Don't play coy with me.

69
00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:27,820
Happy birthday, Director Sharpe.

70
00:03:27,822 --> 00:03:30,222
Oh, sweet God. Um...

71
00:03:30,224 --> 00:03:31,490
wow.

72
00:03:31,492 --> 00:03:32,958
You know that I don't normally like

73
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,459
to celebrate my birthday, but...

74
00:03:34,461 --> 00:03:37,960
Well, I am here to fix
that, so close your eyes.

75
00:03:37,963 --> 00:03:39,194
What?

76
00:03:40,701 --> 00:03:44,069
- I said close your eyes.
- Okay. Okay.

77
00:03:47,808 --> 00:03:51,743
Are you ready for your birthday present?

78
00:03:51,745 --> 00:03:53,512
Yes.

79
00:03:53,514 --> 00:03:55,386
Are we really doing this?

80
00:03:55,389 --> 00:03:56,455
Oh!

81
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:58,053
Director Sharpe, we need to talk.

82
00:03:58,056 --> 00:03:59,108
Of course, sir.

83
00:03:59,111 --> 00:04:01,086
I-I was just, uh, meditating.

84
00:04:01,088 --> 00:04:03,355
There's this great app that...

85
00:04:03,357 --> 00:04:04,823
Meditate on this.

86
00:04:04,825 --> 00:04:07,125
- Oh, my God.
- Exactly.

87
00:04:07,127 --> 00:04:10,996
These are expenses generated
by the crew of the Waverider,

88
00:04:10,998 --> 00:04:13,198
the tip of the Time Bureau spear...

89
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,901
- Mm-hmm.
- Your Legends.

90
00:04:16,604 --> 00:04:18,604
You said they were worth
the additional funding.

91
00:04:18,606 --> 00:04:22,307
Let me refer you to some
of my favorite line items.

92
00:04:22,309 --> 00:04:25,177
$135 million for a new Timecore.

93
00:04:25,179 --> 00:04:26,578
What was wrong with the old one?

94
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,747
Oh, well, um, Rip blew it up

95
00:04:28,749 --> 00:04:31,147
when he sacrificed his
life to save the world.

96
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:32,484
Sacrifice is right.

97
00:04:32,486 --> 00:04:35,754
$1.7 million for historical costumes.

98
00:04:35,756 --> 00:04:39,424
Mm-hmm. Well, admittedly,
their costumes are flamboyant.

99
00:04:39,426 --> 00:04:42,394
A line item for, and I quote,

100
00:04:42,396 --> 00:04:45,130
"assorted condiments." Assorted?

101
00:04:45,132 --> 00:04:47,421
No one ever accused the
Legends of starving, sir.

102
00:04:47,424 --> 00:04:48,790
If I didn't know any better,

103
00:04:48,793 --> 00:04:50,868
I'd say you were in
bed with the Legends.

104
00:04:50,871 --> 00:04:52,471
Either that, or this Captain Sara Lance

105
00:04:52,473 --> 00:04:54,039
is simply screwing you.

106
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:57,276
- What? Screwing me...
- Sara Lance?

107
00:04:58,512 --> 00:05:00,445
Sir, that is... That is crazy.

108
00:05:00,447 --> 00:05:03,148
Which is exactly what the
Pentagon is going to call me

109
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:06,051
unless we find a way to
justify these numbers.

110
00:05:06,053 --> 00:05:07,953
Got it, sir.

111
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,383
Whew!

112
00:05:12,386 --> 00:05:14,058
I... look,

113
00:05:14,061 --> 00:05:16,061
I know that your team
is worth the money,

114
00:05:16,063 --> 00:05:18,130
- but I...
- I will talk to the team,

115
00:05:18,132 --> 00:05:19,865
see if we can tighten our belts.

116
00:05:19,867 --> 00:05:21,100
Thank you.

117
00:05:21,103 --> 00:05:23,272
I increase their budget

118
00:05:23,275 --> 00:05:25,737
so they can build
magical containment cells

119
00:05:25,739 --> 00:05:27,339
to start capturing these creatures.

120
00:05:27,341 --> 00:05:30,409
Meanwhile, they're running
a nine-figure deficit

121
00:05:30,411 --> 00:05:31,421
on a timeship.

122
00:05:31,424 --> 00:05:32,890
Okay, take a deep breath, Hank.

123
00:05:32,893 --> 00:05:34,366
If you knew what the Legends did,

124
00:05:34,369 --> 00:05:36,722
you'd realize they're...
they're worth every single penny.

125
00:05:36,725 --> 00:05:38,750
Now, how about this?
I'll set up a ride-along.

126
00:05:38,752 --> 00:05:41,987
You can meet the gang and
see where I used to live.

127
00:05:41,989 --> 00:05:43,655
I can see where my money's going.

128
00:05:43,657 --> 00:05:45,324
- Sure.
- You're right.

129
00:05:45,326 --> 00:05:46,925
Why don't we go now?

130
00:05:46,927 --> 00:05:48,527
Now?

131
00:05:48,529 --> 00:05:50,395
You know, um, we should
probably give 'em a chance,

132
00:05:50,397 --> 00:05:51,530
you know, to clean up.

133
00:05:51,532 --> 00:05:52,831
We can't warn them we're coming.

134
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:55,233
That would defeat the purpose.

135
00:05:55,235 --> 00:05:56,635
Okay, um...

136
00:05:56,637 --> 00:05:58,036
I mean, I got to hail the Waverider,

137
00:05:58,038 --> 00:05:59,338
and that's gonna take forever.

138
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,440
Nathaniel, as your boss,

139
00:06:01,442 --> 00:06:03,809
I demand you take me to the Waverider.

140
00:06:03,811 --> 00:06:05,177
Gonna play the boss card again?

141
00:06:05,179 --> 00:06:09,581
Okay, then, sir... Captain Heywood.

142
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:12,684
Let's go see what the Legends are up to.

143
00:06:12,686 --> 00:06:17,622
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

144
00:06:17,624 --> 00:06:19,291
I can deal with Hank, and we still have

145
00:06:19,293 --> 00:06:21,860
plenty of time to get things
on the ship back in order.

146
00:06:21,862 --> 00:06:23,261
What are they...

147
00:06:23,263 --> 00:06:26,198
- I should probably...
- Go! Go. Go.

148
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,766
Delivery for Sara...

149
00:06:29,837 --> 00:06:31,069
Damn it.

150
00:06:31,071 --> 00:06:32,804
Sorry.

151
00:06:32,806 --> 00:06:35,741
Wait, don't forget your, um...

152
00:06:36,877 --> 00:06:38,443
Birthday cake.

153
00:06:38,445 --> 00:06:40,712
Red alert, Nate is on the ship,

154
00:06:40,714 --> 00:06:42,581
and he brought his dad
for what's got to be

155
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:44,316
a surprise inspection.

156
00:06:44,318 --> 00:06:47,352
We are so not ready for guests.

157
00:06:47,354 --> 00:06:48,887
Nate's here?

158
00:06:48,889 --> 00:06:51,423
I could really use a hug
and get his advice on Nora.

159
00:06:51,425 --> 00:06:53,525
Did you forget who else is on the ship?

160
00:06:53,527 --> 00:06:55,627
Charlie. You can't let him see her

161
00:06:55,629 --> 00:06:57,329
until we have time
to explain why there's

162
00:06:57,331 --> 00:06:58,897
an Amaya look-alike on board.

163
00:06:58,899 --> 00:07:00,465
- Right.
- Last time I saw her,

164
00:07:00,467 --> 00:07:01,867
she was in the lab.

165
00:07:04,071 --> 00:07:06,238
Everyone, keep Nate away from the lab.

166
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,639
I'm on my way.

167
00:07:07,641 --> 00:07:09,708
Any tour of the ship should start here.

168
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:11,710
This is where the
Legends have team meetings

169
00:07:11,712 --> 00:07:15,147
and hold lively symposiums
of ideas and solutions,

170
00:07:15,149 --> 00:07:17,215
all led by Captain Sara Lance.

171
00:07:17,217 --> 00:07:19,785
And where is this Captain Lance?

172
00:07:19,787 --> 00:07:21,720
Um...

173
00:07:21,722 --> 00:07:23,436
um, it is a little quiet,

174
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:25,357
but I assure you
Captain Lance is securing

175
00:07:25,359 --> 00:07:27,626
the Legends' next daring mission.

176
00:07:27,628 --> 00:07:30,629
Next up, the parlour,
which we spell with a U

177
00:07:30,631 --> 00:07:33,231
because our first captain was British.

178
00:07:33,233 --> 00:07:35,033
So why does a ship

179
00:07:35,035 --> 00:07:37,235
formerly manned by a single person

180
00:07:37,237 --> 00:07:38,272
now need...

181
00:07:38,275 --> 00:07:39,638
Need a crew of six?

182
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,139
- I can explain.
- Hey, Ray.

183
00:07:41,141 --> 00:07:42,441
- Hi.
- Hi.

184
00:07:42,443 --> 00:07:44,176
Uh, he means five. You mean five.

185
00:07:44,178 --> 00:07:45,174
I mean five. I mean five.

186
00:07:45,176 --> 00:07:46,754
I must have been thinking about Gideon

187
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:48,046
as a real person.

188
00:07:48,048 --> 00:07:50,905
Are you trying to hurt
my feelings, Dr. Palmer?

189
00:07:50,908 --> 00:07:54,280
Oh, wow, Gideon. Hubba, hubba.

190
00:07:54,283 --> 00:07:55,725
Love the new look.

191
00:07:55,728 --> 00:07:58,913
Ms. Tomaz gave me, in
her words, a face-lift.

192
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:00,859
This is a talking computer?

193
00:08:00,861 --> 00:08:03,462
Actually, I'm a
quantum-enhanced A.I. program,

194
00:08:03,464 --> 00:08:05,864
capable of operating
completely autonomously.

195
00:08:05,866 --> 00:08:07,199
So what you're saying is,

196
00:08:07,201 --> 00:08:09,167
you don't need any people on the ship.

197
00:08:09,169 --> 00:08:11,503
Oh, no, no, no, no, we do.

198
00:08:11,505 --> 00:08:14,035
Ray, why don't you show
Hank what you do in the...

199
00:08:14,038 --> 00:08:15,674
Not the Lab.

200
00:08:15,676 --> 00:08:16,875
Hello, sir.

201
00:08:16,877 --> 00:08:19,113
Um, you should take him to the library.

202
00:08:19,116 --> 00:08:22,380
It's very impressive,
and there are... books.

203
00:08:22,382 --> 00:08:24,449
- And bookshelves.
- Bookshelves.

204
00:08:24,451 --> 00:08:27,252
See, Hank, it takes a village.

205
00:08:27,254 --> 00:08:28,487
Follow me.

206
00:08:30,991 --> 00:08:35,293
- God.
- It was a good save.

207
00:08:35,295 --> 00:08:37,062
Now, the library is my domain.

208
00:08:37,064 --> 00:08:40,265
I've assembled quite a collection of...

209
00:08:47,141 --> 00:08:50,139
Nate, it's good to see you, mate.

210
00:08:50,142 --> 00:08:52,082
You haven't seen the
laboratory yet, have you?

211
00:08:52,085 --> 00:08:53,345
No, why?

212
00:08:53,347 --> 00:08:55,480
Because you should always
save the best for last.

213
00:08:55,482 --> 00:08:56,815
Yeah, you should really

214
00:08:56,817 --> 00:08:58,683
put some clothes on when we have guests.

215
00:08:58,685 --> 00:09:02,521
So this is your domain.

216
00:09:02,523 --> 00:09:04,489
Why don't we move on, huh?

217
00:09:09,997 --> 00:09:12,264
Mr. Heywood, welcome aboard.

218
00:09:12,266 --> 00:09:14,332
I see you've already
had the complete tour.

219
00:09:14,334 --> 00:09:17,561
He hasn't seen the lab yet.

220
00:09:17,564 --> 00:09:18,730
That's a great idea.

221
00:09:18,733 --> 00:09:20,796
Wait till you see this.

222
00:09:22,121 --> 00:09:23,350
Hey, so maybe your dad

223
00:09:23,353 --> 00:09:24,652
would like to see the galley.

224
00:09:24,655 --> 00:09:26,510
Or the cargo bay with all the crates.

225
00:09:26,513 --> 00:09:29,848
Or... or the bathroom.
It's a marvel of efficiency.

226
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:32,217
Look, you guys need to
pull it together, okay?

227
00:09:32,219 --> 00:09:34,152
Look, I know my dad sprung this on us,

228
00:09:34,154 --> 00:09:37,622
but we have dealt with crazier things...

229
00:09:41,595 --> 00:09:42,983
Amaya?

230
00:09:42,986 --> 00:09:45,654
So this is the ex-girlfriend
you can't shut up about?

231
00:09:45,657 --> 00:09:47,024
Look, I'm sorry. I
should have told you...

232
00:09:47,026 --> 00:09:48,292
She came back.

233
00:09:48,295 --> 00:09:49,968
I knew she'd come back.

234
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:52,103
No, you don't understand. It's not...

235
00:09:59,947 --> 00:10:01,311
You look beautiful.

236
00:10:01,314 --> 00:10:03,415
Get your stinking mitts
off of me, you knob.

237
00:10:03,417 --> 00:10:05,784
Whoa.

238
00:10:06,653 --> 00:10:08,486
We should just... We're gonna...

239
00:10:08,488 --> 00:10:10,922
Yeah, just go. Go.

240
00:10:10,924 --> 00:10:12,958
You've changed.

241
00:10:14,255 --> 00:10:15,467
What the hell's going on?

242
00:10:15,478 --> 00:10:16,469
And what's with that accent?

243
00:10:16,471 --> 00:10:18,115
I mean, I dig it, but what's going on?

244
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,677
Well, I'm not your
disco-loving ex, mate.

245
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,581
Meet the newest member of our team,

246
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:24,782
Charlie.

247
00:10:24,784 --> 00:10:27,452
Charlie here is a shape-shifter.

248
00:10:27,454 --> 00:10:29,354
Except she can no longer shape-shift.

249
00:10:29,356 --> 00:10:31,122
It's actually a pretty crazy story.

250
00:10:31,124 --> 00:10:32,790
Let me guess: she turned into Amaya

251
00:10:32,792 --> 00:10:34,392
and conned you into
not sending her to hell

252
00:10:34,394 --> 00:10:35,460
and Constantine put a spell on her

253
00:10:35,462 --> 00:10:36,694
and now she's stuck like this?

254
00:10:36,696 --> 00:10:37,895
That is...

255
00:10:37,897 --> 00:10:40,014
- weirdly accurate, yeah.
- Yeah.

256
00:10:40,017 --> 00:10:41,699
I guess it's not such a crazy story.

257
00:10:41,701 --> 00:10:42,842
It's insane, Ray!

258
00:10:42,845 --> 00:10:45,002
I told my dad you guys
were good at your jobs,

259
00:10:45,005 --> 00:10:47,171
and now you're adopting
some magical creature

260
00:10:47,173 --> 00:10:48,573
who's pretending to be Amaya?

261
00:10:48,575 --> 00:10:50,375
Hey, I'm not pretending to be anyone.

262
00:10:50,377 --> 00:10:51,725
That said,

263
00:10:51,728 --> 00:10:53,945
Hank's already looking for
ways to slash our funding,

264
00:10:53,947 --> 00:10:55,880
so maybe it's not the worst idea

265
00:10:55,882 --> 00:10:57,715
to fake it for one mission.

266
00:10:57,717 --> 00:11:00,418
You want me to pretend
to be this wanker's ex?

267
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,490
What...

268
00:11:01,493 --> 00:11:03,436
Sounds like classic
Legends hijinks to me.

269
00:11:03,439 --> 00:11:06,289
We can't let Hank know that
we're harboring a fugitive.

270
00:11:06,292 --> 00:11:07,892
We just need to show him one mission,

271
00:11:07,894 --> 00:11:12,630
send him on his way before
anything can go wrong.

272
00:11:12,632 --> 00:11:14,632
Okay, then maybe it wasn't the best idea

273
00:11:14,634 --> 00:11:16,968
to leave him with those three.

274
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:18,703
- We should go.
- Yeah.

275
00:11:18,705 --> 00:11:20,872
All right, team, showtime.

276
00:11:26,913 --> 00:11:31,249
- Drinking at work.
- Who said anything about work?

277
00:11:31,251 --> 00:11:34,819
Hey, Legends, you hear that?

278
00:11:34,821 --> 00:11:36,454
We got a hit on the magic-o-meter.

279
00:11:36,456 --> 00:11:38,856
Oh, where in history
are we gonna end up next?

280
00:11:38,858 --> 00:11:41,492
Where will it be? The Wild West,

281
00:11:41,494 --> 00:11:44,962
medieval China, or...

282
00:11:44,964 --> 00:11:47,331
Paris in the Roaring Twenties?

283
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,767
- Ooh, la, la.
- Gideon, plot a course.

284
00:11:49,769 --> 00:11:51,076
Yes, Captain, right away.

285
00:11:51,079 --> 00:11:53,970
So explain to me how this
magic-o-meter of yours works.

286
00:11:53,973 --> 00:11:55,173
Oh, well...

287
00:11:55,175 --> 00:11:56,908
Thingy goes beep, and we kick ass.

288
00:11:56,910 --> 00:12:00,170
Meaning we investigate each time period.

289
00:12:00,173 --> 00:12:02,580
- We find the creature.
- We bring it to the Bureau.

290
00:12:02,582 --> 00:12:05,116
And hopefully learn some
life lessons along the way.

291
00:12:05,118 --> 00:12:07,428
And it takes six of you to do that?

292
00:12:07,431 --> 00:12:10,088
- Seven if you count Amaya.
- Eight if you count me.

293
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:12,123
Sounds a little inefficient.

294
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:17,662
Which is why we separate
into two very important teams.

295
00:12:17,664 --> 00:12:20,465
Zee, John, Ray, and Amaya

296
00:12:20,467 --> 00:12:21,833
will stay on the ship to quarterback

297
00:12:21,835 --> 00:12:23,901
while the rest of us go in search

298
00:12:23,903 --> 00:12:27,672
of whatever is wreaking
havoc on gay Paree.

299
00:12:27,674 --> 00:12:30,608
I thought that was, uh,
inpolitically correct.

300
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:32,510
Politically incorrect.

301
00:12:32,512 --> 00:12:34,846
Hey, it's our first mission together.

302
00:12:34,848 --> 00:12:36,656
Don't worry, if anything
goes wrong in the field,

303
00:12:36,658 --> 00:12:38,416
I got you covered.

304
00:12:38,418 --> 00:12:39,684
Yeah, but...

305
00:12:39,686 --> 00:12:42,453
I didn't get coldcocked by a girl.

306
00:12:42,455 --> 00:12:46,758
Have you ever been hit by a girl, Hank?

307
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,392
No, ma'am.

308
00:12:48,394 --> 00:12:49,794
Hmm.

309
00:12:49,796 --> 00:12:51,295
We should head out.

310
00:13:03,343 --> 00:13:07,745
Café du Dôme, 1927, home
to the Lost Generation.

311
00:13:07,747 --> 00:13:10,348
Writers, artists, ex-pats, they all...

312
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:12,016
All right, so where's this monster?

313
00:13:12,018 --> 00:13:14,619
Yeah, who needs historical
context and wonderment?

314
00:13:14,621 --> 00:13:16,187
I need a drink.

315
00:13:16,189 --> 00:13:19,023
What he means is, we need
to blend in with the locals.

316
00:13:19,025 --> 00:13:20,725
This is a recon mission.

317
00:13:20,727 --> 00:13:22,593
I believe...

318
00:13:22,595 --> 00:13:24,428
Oh, my God. It's him.

319
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:26,097
Salvador Dalí.

320
00:13:26,099 --> 00:13:27,724
What, the creep with the weird mustache?

321
00:13:27,727 --> 00:13:28,866
Don't point.

322
00:13:28,868 --> 00:13:30,344
He's the father of surrealism.

323
00:13:30,347 --> 00:13:31,735
This is your plan?

324
00:13:31,738 --> 00:13:33,004
To catch this creature,

325
00:13:33,006 --> 00:13:35,740
you ask a bunch of artsy-fartsy fools...

326
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:39,110
Oh, my God. It's him.

327
00:13:40,947 --> 00:13:42,146
It's Papa.

328
00:13:42,148 --> 00:13:44,248
Papa? What, your grandfather's here?

329
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,350
- No.
- Thought he blew up in space.

330
00:13:46,352 --> 00:13:47,685
You are so insensitive.

331
00:13:47,687 --> 00:13:50,421
Not that Papa. Ernest Hemingway.

332
00:13:50,423 --> 00:13:52,156
He's, like, my dad's spirit animal.

333
00:13:52,158 --> 00:13:54,292
I say if we want to get things done,

334
00:13:54,294 --> 00:13:56,928
we ask the original man of action.

335
00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:00,798
Your dad is totally
geeking out right now.

336
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,200
Mm-hmm, my entire life,

337
00:14:02,202 --> 00:14:04,569
my father would go on
and on about Hemingway

338
00:14:04,571 --> 00:14:06,604
and how that was his idea of a real man.

339
00:14:06,606 --> 00:14:08,406
And that is when I was attacked

340
00:14:08,408 --> 00:14:12,076
by the monstrous man of the Catacombs.

341
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:15,179
Well, it's time to talk
to some artsy-fartsy fools.

342
00:14:16,449 --> 00:14:17,915
Pardon moi.

343
00:14:17,917 --> 00:14:20,418
Uh, you said you saw a monstrous man.

344
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,186
- Can you explain?
- Of course.

345
00:14:22,188 --> 00:14:26,657
Um, there was a logarithmic
curve to his form,

346
00:14:26,659 --> 00:14:29,731
the drama of his movement expressing

347
00:14:29,734 --> 00:14:32,797
deep personal cosmogony.

348
00:14:35,702 --> 00:14:37,468
Can you draw me a picture?

349
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:41,072
Okay, let's try one more time.

350
00:14:41,074 --> 00:14:43,903
My name is Amaya Jiwe

351
00:14:43,906 --> 00:14:47,178
of the, uh... The Justice Society of...

352
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,980
complete and utter bloody
rubbish, wouldn't it?

353
00:14:48,982 --> 00:14:50,548
Yep, it sucks.

354
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,849
Now, just remember, the yanks,

355
00:14:51,851 --> 00:14:54,007
they don't say "rubbish." They'd say...

356
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:55,696
"That was absolute garbage.

357
00:14:55,698 --> 00:14:59,589
I'm American, soccer,
yardsticks, ranch dressing,

358
00:14:59,592 --> 00:15:01,259
weasel."

359
00:15:01,261 --> 00:15:03,570
You know what? I quit. Yeah.

360
00:15:03,573 --> 00:15:04,965
I'd rather get some fresh air

361
00:15:04,968 --> 00:15:06,828
than pretend to be this twee old nag.

362
00:15:06,831 --> 00:15:08,695
You can't quit. She can't quit.

363
00:15:08,698 --> 00:15:10,609
Sara needs us to
quarterback the mission.

364
00:15:10,612 --> 00:15:13,140
You don't really think that's
why she left us here, do you?

365
00:15:13,143 --> 00:15:14,639
She just doesn't want us making a scene

366
00:15:14,641 --> 00:15:16,073
in front of Nate's dad.

367
00:15:16,075 --> 00:15:18,910
"Efficiency" is the
new watchword, gents,

368
00:15:18,912 --> 00:15:20,978
and while Hank is
around, the three of us...

369
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:24,115
- Four if you count Charlie.
- Five if you count me.

370
00:15:24,117 --> 00:15:26,150
Are extraneous.

371
00:15:26,152 --> 00:15:28,519
You know, mate, you could just

372
00:15:28,521 --> 00:15:30,187
walk straight off this ship

373
00:15:30,189 --> 00:15:33,524
and no one would even bleeding notice.

374
00:15:33,526 --> 00:15:36,360
Hmph, well, maybe I'll test that theory.

375
00:15:36,362 --> 00:15:37,695
Except I'm not walking.

376
00:15:37,697 --> 00:15:39,664
I'm taking the jumpship.

377
00:15:44,671 --> 00:15:46,504
The answer is no, Ray.

378
00:15:46,506 --> 00:15:48,439
But you haven't even heard my pitch yet.

379
00:15:48,441 --> 00:15:50,741
You want access to a
secret containment facility

380
00:15:50,743 --> 00:15:53,311
for magical creatures...
Where, I might add,

381
00:15:53,313 --> 00:15:55,346
there are no conjugal visits.

382
00:15:55,348 --> 00:15:57,381
Wait, what? You think
that I want to visit Nora

383
00:15:57,383 --> 00:15:59,517
so that we can...

384
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,195
I just want to make
sure that she's okay.

385
00:16:02,198 --> 00:16:05,056
Oh, that is so sweet.

386
00:16:05,058 --> 00:16:06,457
I almost believe that story,

387
00:16:06,459 --> 00:16:08,059
you big lovable teddy bear, you.

388
00:16:08,061 --> 00:16:09,382
But the answer is still no.

389
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,429
With Nate's dad watching
our each and every move,

390
00:16:11,431 --> 00:16:13,397
there is just no time...

391
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:14,932
for love at the Time Bureau.

392
00:16:16,526 --> 00:16:19,094
There's always time for love.

393
00:16:19,097 --> 00:16:22,072
- Were you eavesdropping?
- Maybe.

394
00:16:22,075 --> 00:16:24,508
Or maybe I was meant
to hear your plight.

395
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:26,510
I'm sorry, who are you again?

396
00:16:26,512 --> 00:16:30,214
Name's Mona, and I know where
they've got Nora locked up.

397
00:16:30,216 --> 00:16:31,582
- You do.
- Mm-hmm.

398
00:16:31,584 --> 00:16:33,050
And while I can't sneak you in,

399
00:16:33,052 --> 00:16:35,486
I can help you sneak
in the next best thing.

400
00:16:35,488 --> 00:16:37,455
A love letter.

401
00:16:39,392 --> 00:16:41,292
The bull is not the
enemy of the bullfighter.

402
00:16:41,294 --> 00:16:42,257
He is his partner.

403
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:45,234
They are dancers locked
in a dance of death.

404
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:47,164
Whichever dies, man or bull,

405
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:48,926
the dance is a thing of beauty.

406
00:16:48,929 --> 00:16:50,101
Hey, we got to go.

407
00:16:50,103 --> 00:16:52,851
I got a lead on that,
um, thing we're hunting.

408
00:16:52,854 --> 00:16:55,450
- You're hunters?
- Stay out of this, Hemingway.

409
00:16:55,453 --> 00:16:58,009
Perhaps you'd like to settle
our differences like men.

410
00:16:58,011 --> 00:16:59,977
I don't have time for
this macho crap, man.

411
00:16:59,979 --> 00:17:02,913
Okay, you two with
me. Roy, keep him busy.

412
00:17:02,915 --> 00:17:05,216
Fine specimen of male vitality.

413
00:17:05,218 --> 00:17:07,251
Fellow pugilist, no doubt.

414
00:17:07,253 --> 00:17:08,515
Author.

415
00:17:08,518 --> 00:17:10,688
Ah! My kind of man!

416
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:12,356
Join me.

417
00:17:12,358 --> 00:17:14,191
Okay, Dalí saw the monster firsthand

418
00:17:14,193 --> 00:17:15,726
when it attacked him in the Catacombs,

419
00:17:15,728 --> 00:17:18,262
and he drew me this.

420
00:17:18,264 --> 00:17:19,945
Um, wait.

421
00:17:19,948 --> 00:17:21,465
What the hell am I looking at?

422
00:17:21,468 --> 00:17:22,700
No, no, no, here.

423
00:17:22,702 --> 00:17:23,882
Yeah, I still don't see it.

424
00:17:23,885 --> 00:17:25,702
All right, ignore the melting clocks.

425
00:17:25,705 --> 00:17:27,204
We got to get this back to the ship,

426
00:17:27,206 --> 00:17:28,673
and I have to find a
match to Dalí's drawing

427
00:17:28,675 --> 00:17:29,766
somewhere in the library.

428
00:17:29,769 --> 00:17:31,042
We're supposed to protect history

429
00:17:31,044 --> 00:17:32,643
from the library, Nathaniel?

430
00:17:32,645 --> 00:17:35,379
Okay, I see that you're
really into drinking

431
00:17:35,381 --> 00:17:37,014
the Hemingway Kool-Aid,
and by Kool-Aid,

432
00:17:37,016 --> 00:17:39,650
I mean scotch, but we are here

433
00:17:39,652 --> 00:17:41,052
to catch a monster.

434
00:17:41,054 --> 00:17:42,286
Of course,

435
00:17:42,288 --> 00:17:43,888
but I know we sure as hell aren't gonna

436
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:47,425
find out what it is by
studying some finger paintings.

437
00:17:48,361 --> 00:17:51,062
We gotta go back to the ship
to figure out what we're doing.

438
00:17:51,064 --> 00:17:52,476
That's the way we do things, right?

439
00:17:52,479 --> 00:17:56,866
Yes, when the mission isn't
also showing Hank a good time.

440
00:17:56,869 --> 00:17:59,328
I'm sorry.

441
00:17:59,331 --> 00:18:00,453
You know, I thought this would be good

442
00:18:00,455 --> 00:18:02,221
for the both of us, but...

443
00:18:02,224 --> 00:18:04,007
Hank is at his happiest

444
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:05,776
when he's telling me
what I'm doing wrong,

445
00:18:05,778 --> 00:18:07,078
so...

446
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,124
Mission accomplished.

447
00:18:08,127 --> 00:18:09,547
Aw, cheer up, bud.

448
00:18:09,549 --> 00:18:12,249
You are right, so Rory and I,

449
00:18:12,251 --> 00:18:13,517
we will keep an eye on Hank,

450
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:15,086
let him have a few laughs with Hemingway

451
00:18:15,088 --> 00:18:17,804
while you go figure
out what this thing is.

452
00:18:17,807 --> 00:18:20,308
We bag the creature, we keep our jobs.

453
00:18:20,311 --> 00:18:22,258
Okay.

454
00:18:22,261 --> 00:18:24,261
Whoa, where are you all going?

455
00:18:24,263 --> 00:18:25,830
Henry here told me of a creature

456
00:18:25,832 --> 00:18:27,264
hiding in the Catacombs.

457
00:18:27,266 --> 00:18:28,833
Oh, did you, Henry?

458
00:18:28,835 --> 00:18:31,402
- Therefore we hunt.
- Let's go get our monster.

459
00:18:31,404 --> 00:18:33,676
Nate's right. We have no
idea what this thing is.

460
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,906
A man hunts not to learn about his prey

461
00:18:35,908 --> 00:18:37,575
but to learn about himself.

462
00:18:37,577 --> 00:18:40,437
We need to regroup with the
team and get some backup.

463
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,947
What better backup than Hemingway?

464
00:18:42,949 --> 00:18:44,582
I'm finally starting to understand

465
00:18:44,584 --> 00:18:46,350
what it is the Legends do.

466
00:18:46,352 --> 00:18:49,335
Marcel, fetch me my rifles.

467
00:18:49,338 --> 00:18:51,888
Right away, sir.

468
00:18:51,891 --> 00:18:53,724
I need a Marcel.

469
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,861
Yeah, just a little drunk
hunting with Hemingway.

470
00:18:57,864 --> 00:18:59,663
What could go wrong?

471
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,266
Have you ever held a gun before?

472
00:19:17,268 --> 00:19:19,502
Once or twice.

473
00:19:19,504 --> 00:19:21,871
Your friend is much woman.

474
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:27,310
Have my own.

475
00:19:27,312 --> 00:19:28,945
Signature weapon, I like it.

476
00:19:32,884 --> 00:19:34,250
The drunk painter was right.

477
00:19:34,252 --> 00:19:35,868
The creature is hiding in the Catacombs.

478
00:19:35,871 --> 00:19:37,602
- And it's getting closer.
- We need a plan.

479
00:19:37,605 --> 00:19:39,055
We have no idea what this thing is

480
00:19:39,057 --> 00:19:41,057
and if it can even be
stopped with bullets.

481
00:19:41,059 --> 00:19:43,526
I've found that in
life, the shortest answer

482
00:19:43,528 --> 00:19:45,795
is doing the thing.

483
00:19:45,797 --> 00:19:47,363
Let's do this thing.

484
00:19:51,836 --> 00:19:53,714
I knew you couldn't resist.

485
00:19:53,717 --> 00:19:55,838
Did you get to the end,
where the correctional officer

486
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,942
convinces the judge to send
her to prison so he can go free?

487
00:19:59,944 --> 00:20:03,412
Well, I have now.

488
00:20:03,414 --> 00:20:05,681
Sorry, didn't mean to ruin it.

489
00:20:05,683 --> 00:20:08,284
But I brought you an even better one.

490
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:15,878
The hell is this?

491
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,222
It's a letter

492
00:20:17,225 --> 00:20:18,693
from your crush.

493
00:20:18,696 --> 00:20:20,371
Ray left it behind for you.

494
00:20:20,374 --> 00:20:21,707
Don't you see?

495
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:23,965
Yours is a love no bars can contain.

496
00:20:23,968 --> 00:20:25,468
No, I-I don't want it.

497
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:27,303
But don't you want to at least open it?

498
00:20:27,305 --> 00:20:28,332
No.

499
00:20:28,335 --> 00:20:29,905
What if you change your mind

500
00:20:29,908 --> 00:20:30,873
or your heart?

501
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:32,842
Not gonna change my...

502
00:20:32,844 --> 00:20:34,911
Take the damn letter.

503
00:20:36,281 --> 00:20:37,613
Look what you made me do.

504
00:20:37,615 --> 00:20:39,782
Uh-oh.

505
00:20:39,784 --> 00:20:41,517
Sorry.

506
00:20:44,014 --> 00:20:47,423
Uh, I swear it's one of these buttons.

507
00:20:47,425 --> 00:20:49,392
What the hell?

508
00:20:50,829 --> 00:20:53,229
Are you okay?

509
00:20:53,231 --> 00:20:54,864
Did she attack you?

510
00:20:54,866 --> 00:20:58,067
It's fine. Just...
just a misunderstanding.

511
00:20:58,069 --> 00:21:00,152
The hell is this?

512
00:21:00,155 --> 00:21:01,736
Where'd you get this?

513
00:21:04,609 --> 00:21:06,609
Did Mona deliver this to you?

514
00:21:09,314 --> 00:21:11,247
Okay, since neither of
you have anything to say,

515
00:21:11,249 --> 00:21:13,783
I'll let the letter speak for itself.

516
00:21:13,785 --> 00:21:16,152
No!

517
00:21:25,964 --> 00:21:27,997
Requesting emergency assistance!

518
00:21:29,234 --> 00:21:31,467
I-I didn't... didn't mean to...

519
00:21:31,469 --> 00:21:32,753
We're stuck.

520
00:21:32,756 --> 00:21:36,524
Well, at least we're
all here together, right?

521
00:21:38,042 --> 00:21:40,476
Now I know why you took my shoelaces.

522
00:21:46,117 --> 00:21:47,617
Uh, pardon.

523
00:21:50,822 --> 00:21:52,832
Mm-mm.

524
00:21:52,835 --> 00:21:54,457
Américain.

525
00:21:54,459 --> 00:21:58,427
Lost?

526
00:21:58,429 --> 00:21:59,925
- No, I'm good.
- Oh.

527
00:21:59,928 --> 00:22:01,530
'Cause you're heading
in the wrong direction.

528
00:22:01,532 --> 00:22:02,732
The Waverider's over there.

529
00:22:02,734 --> 00:22:04,834
I don't need directions from you.

530
00:22:04,836 --> 00:22:06,355
Listen, sunshine.

531
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:08,285
I don't know what beef
you had with your ex,

532
00:22:08,288 --> 00:22:09,872
but don't bring it on me.

533
00:22:09,874 --> 00:22:11,307
Zelda, dear, I do believe

534
00:22:11,309 --> 00:22:13,342
they're giving us a run for our money.

535
00:22:13,344 --> 00:22:15,077
You're the Fitzgeralds.

536
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:16,345
And we pride ourselves

537
00:22:16,347 --> 00:22:18,514
the most quarrelsome couple in Paris.

538
00:22:18,516 --> 00:22:20,850
Don't worry. We're not a couple.

539
00:22:20,852 --> 00:22:22,285
Well, the night is still young.

540
00:22:22,287 --> 00:22:24,053
You should join us for a drink.

541
00:22:24,055 --> 00:22:27,790
Besides, no one should be out
on the streets alone tonight.

542
00:22:27,792 --> 00:22:30,593
There is a monster on the loose.

543
00:22:30,595 --> 00:22:32,962
- You heard about the monster.
- Come with me.

544
00:22:32,964 --> 00:22:35,865
What conversation isn't
better had over a gin rickey?

545
00:22:46,144 --> 00:22:49,111
Do you hear that?

546
00:23:00,558 --> 00:23:02,425
Dalí's the only one
who's seen the beast.

547
00:23:02,427 --> 00:23:03,726
Take it for what it's worth.

548
00:23:03,728 --> 00:23:05,328
Well, I spoke with him myself,

549
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:08,631
and according to Dalí,
this is what it looks like.

550
00:23:08,633 --> 00:23:11,691
I can never make heads or
tails of Salvador's work.

551
00:23:11,694 --> 00:23:13,335
That's a Minotaur.

552
00:23:13,338 --> 00:23:15,618
A beast... Half man, half bull,

553
00:23:15,621 --> 00:23:17,543
spent its whole life lost in a maze?

554
00:23:17,546 --> 00:23:19,375
Ah, now, that's the common myth,

555
00:23:19,377 --> 00:23:21,094
but I heard a different story.

556
00:23:21,097 --> 00:23:23,562
The Minotaur, he's not lost.

557
00:23:23,565 --> 00:23:25,031
He's hiding.

558
00:23:25,034 --> 00:23:26,681
Rejected by his father,

559
00:23:26,684 --> 00:23:28,751
he felt that he had no
place in the real world,

560
00:23:28,753 --> 00:23:31,578
and so he chose to stay in the maze.

561
00:23:31,581 --> 00:23:33,189
If Dalí thinks he's seen one of these,

562
00:23:33,191 --> 00:23:34,523
I want what he's drinking.

563
00:23:36,854 --> 00:23:38,008
Where you going?

564
00:23:38,011 --> 00:23:39,210
I am going to figure out

565
00:23:39,213 --> 00:23:40,500
a way to catch a Minotaur

566
00:23:40,503 --> 00:23:41,703
and show my father

567
00:23:41,706 --> 00:23:44,006
what a real man of action looks like.

568
00:23:46,046 --> 00:23:48,837
There it is, awaiting the fight.

569
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,272
I got this! Mine's longer.

570
00:24:13,064 --> 00:24:16,265
- Fall back!
- Wait, I've got the shot.

571
00:24:16,267 --> 00:24:18,034
Aah!

572
00:24:18,036 --> 00:24:19,164
We have to go now!

573
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:20,445
I'll never surrender.

574
00:24:21,939 --> 00:24:24,073
But I will strategically retreat.

575
00:24:24,075 --> 00:24:25,474
Get back!

576
00:24:29,098 --> 00:24:31,621
Gideon, Hank's hurt.
Show him what you can do.

577
00:24:31,624 --> 00:24:32,923
Right away, Captain.

578
00:24:32,925 --> 00:24:34,887
Dad, are you okay?

579
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,193
Please don't blame the Legends.

580
00:24:36,195 --> 00:24:37,394
I should have been there.

581
00:24:37,396 --> 00:24:38,562
Because then you would have seen me

582
00:24:38,564 --> 00:24:40,497
lock eyes with the beast,

583
00:24:40,499 --> 00:24:41,899
and it was in that moment

584
00:24:41,901 --> 00:24:44,501
that I felt a deep and mutual respect.

585
00:24:44,503 --> 00:24:46,747
- Wow, someone's been bonding with Papa.
- Yeah.

586
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,505
Respect that gave way to resolve

587
00:24:48,507 --> 00:24:50,374
as the beast drew its blade.

588
00:24:50,376 --> 00:24:51,892
The dance had begun.

589
00:24:51,895 --> 00:24:54,511
- Okay, Gideon.
- Initiating scan.

590
00:24:54,513 --> 00:24:57,467
So CliffsNotes: big ax, bigger monster,

591
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:58,436
knows we're on it.

592
00:24:58,439 --> 00:24:59,572
We need a plan B quick.

593
00:24:59,575 --> 00:25:01,318
Okay. Dad, you heal up.

594
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,220
- We've got this.
- No, like hell.

595
00:25:03,222 --> 00:25:06,072
I owe it to him to finish this... fight.

596
00:25:06,075 --> 00:25:07,324
Sedative administered.

597
00:25:07,326 --> 00:25:09,226
And you thought a
Minotaur was bullheaded?

598
00:25:09,228 --> 00:25:11,261
Ooh, mythology burn.

599
00:25:11,263 --> 00:25:13,564
It's good to have you back.

600
00:25:13,566 --> 00:25:15,165
There has to be a way out of here.

601
00:25:15,167 --> 00:25:17,009
Well, it's a prison cell.

602
00:25:17,012 --> 00:25:19,878
Or an incubator for our
burgeoning friendship.

603
00:25:19,881 --> 00:25:21,806
Isn't breaking out of prison your thing?

604
00:25:21,809 --> 00:25:23,751
Only reason I escaped last time was

605
00:25:23,754 --> 00:25:25,387
because Ray gave me a Time Stone.

606
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:26,689
Tell me everything,

607
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:28,812
because I am big-time shipping you two.

608
00:25:28,814 --> 00:25:31,476
No shipping the inmates.

609
00:25:31,479 --> 00:25:33,813
It's the reason we're stuck
in here in the first place.

610
00:25:34,819 --> 00:25:38,287
I know that getting your
boss locked in a prison

611
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:40,357
isn't the best way to start a job,

612
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:43,260
so if it comes to it, I'd
like you to eat me first.

613
00:25:43,262 --> 00:25:45,095
No one's eating anyone, Mona,

614
00:25:45,097 --> 00:25:47,264
but when we get out of here,
we do have to talk about

615
00:25:47,266 --> 00:25:49,499
your continued employment at the Bureau.

616
00:25:49,501 --> 00:25:52,402
Wait, no, no, no, you can't fire me.

617
00:25:52,404 --> 00:25:54,304
Give me one good reason why.

618
00:25:55,207 --> 00:25:57,774
Okay. Okay.

619
00:25:59,912 --> 00:26:02,646
I was gonna save this for upstairs,

620
00:26:02,648 --> 00:26:05,215
but...

621
00:26:05,217 --> 00:26:07,617
surprise!

622
00:26:14,393 --> 00:26:16,593
This isn't making things better, is it?

623
00:26:16,595 --> 00:26:18,628
No, it's fantastic. Keep going.

624
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:20,430
So that's it?

625
00:26:20,432 --> 00:26:23,848
I finally find a job where
I can use my skills...

626
00:26:23,851 --> 00:26:25,618
Debatable.

627
00:26:25,621 --> 00:26:28,671
And I blow it in the first week.

628
00:26:28,674 --> 00:26:31,541
Guess I'm stuck doing my fallback plan,

629
00:26:31,543 --> 00:26:33,577
going back to law school.

630
00:26:33,579 --> 00:26:35,479
At least Yale wants me.

631
00:26:36,315 --> 00:26:38,315
Wait, wait, that's the fallback plan?

632
00:26:38,317 --> 00:26:41,685
Law school? What are
you even doing here?

633
00:26:41,687 --> 00:26:43,637
This is my dream job.

634
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,756
It's my mom who wants me to be a lawyer.

635
00:26:45,758 --> 00:26:48,876
No, you can't give in to
what your parents want.

636
00:26:48,879 --> 00:26:51,828
That's what I did, and
look how that ended.

637
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:54,331
Okay, you're not gonna take

638
00:26:54,333 --> 00:26:56,536
life advice from Nora Darhk, right?

639
00:26:56,539 --> 00:26:58,435
That's rich. You should
listen to your parents.

640
00:26:58,437 --> 00:26:59,739
Think about your future.

641
00:26:59,742 --> 00:27:02,405
Oh, easy for you to say.
At least you had a future.

642
00:27:02,407 --> 00:27:04,241
When I was a kid, my dad convinced me

643
00:27:04,243 --> 00:27:05,442
to be a demon vessel.

644
00:27:05,445 --> 00:27:06,943
You think it was easy for me?

645
00:27:06,945 --> 00:27:08,245
At least you got to be a kid.

646
00:27:08,247 --> 00:27:10,180
Try being a clone from 2213, okay?

647
00:27:10,182 --> 00:27:12,048
The only taste of
childhood I've ever had

648
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:14,417
was almost being killed by
a Shtriga at summer camp.

649
00:27:14,419 --> 00:27:16,286
Wow, okay, I need to hear

650
00:27:16,288 --> 00:27:18,288
your entire life stories right now.

651
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:19,504
No.

652
00:27:19,507 --> 00:27:21,111
We might as well get to know each other

653
00:27:21,114 --> 00:27:22,592
if we're stuck here.

654
00:27:22,595 --> 00:27:26,597
Or... at least have a drink?

655
00:27:27,666 --> 00:27:29,199
Where did you...

656
00:27:29,935 --> 00:27:32,235
We need to bag ourselves a Minotaur

657
00:27:32,237 --> 00:27:34,231
before your dad gets himself killed.

658
00:27:34,234 --> 00:27:35,931
Ugh, what is that smell?

659
00:27:35,934 --> 00:27:37,440
Did you guys get a team dog without me?

660
00:27:37,442 --> 00:27:38,842
Because that was my idea.

661
00:27:38,844 --> 00:27:40,210
Bet you guys are having

662
00:27:40,212 --> 00:27:42,546
post-mission pizza parties now too.

663
00:27:42,548 --> 00:27:46,692
This is the artificial
musk of a female Minotaur.

664
00:27:46,695 --> 00:27:48,552
See, Minotaurs have a
very sharp sense of smell

665
00:27:48,554 --> 00:27:49,686
when it comes to tracking prey,

666
00:27:49,688 --> 00:27:51,321
but with this little bad boy,

667
00:27:51,323 --> 00:27:54,223
I can lure it in by convincing
it that I'm a potential mate.

668
00:27:54,226 --> 00:27:55,359
Then what?

669
00:27:55,362 --> 00:27:56,653
You two gonna ride off together,

670
00:27:56,656 --> 00:27:58,051
get a nice little flat in Soho?

671
00:27:58,054 --> 00:27:59,995
It's good, but we still
need a way to tame it

672
00:27:59,998 --> 00:28:01,865
and get it to the Bureau.

673
00:28:01,867 --> 00:28:03,400
Taming the beast. Taming the beast.

674
00:28:03,402 --> 00:28:05,502
I read about this. I read about this.

675
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:09,272
Um, let's see, "The Magical
Treatise of Solomon."

676
00:28:09,274 --> 00:28:10,774
Here we go.

677
00:28:10,776 --> 00:28:12,609
"To ease the Minotaur's rage,

678
00:28:12,611 --> 00:28:14,511
his mother would play him a lullaby

679
00:28:14,513 --> 00:28:17,347
on a lute built by Daedalus."

680
00:28:17,349 --> 00:28:18,548
That's it.

681
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:20,550
We'll lure it out and lull it to sleep.

682
00:28:20,552 --> 00:28:23,253
No one gets hurt, not even the Minotaur.

683
00:28:24,122 --> 00:28:26,456
And then we'll have a pizza party.

684
00:28:26,458 --> 00:28:28,158
And that's when I found out

685
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,326
I was from the future.

686
00:28:29,328 --> 00:28:31,697
- Whoa, the future.
- Yep.

687
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,430
It was all fake:

688
00:28:33,432 --> 00:28:35,899
my parents, my memories,

689
00:28:35,901 --> 00:28:37,334
growing up in Fresno.

690
00:28:37,336 --> 00:28:39,135
Still better than
spending your childhood

691
00:28:39,137 --> 00:28:40,785
with The Order of the Shrouded Compass.

692
00:28:40,788 --> 00:28:41,678
- Wh...
- Is that like

693
00:28:41,681 --> 00:28:43,672
the Sisterhood of Traveling Pants?

694
00:28:43,675 --> 00:28:46,209
Even worse. Death cult.

695
00:28:46,211 --> 00:28:48,678
And before that, I just moved around

696
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:51,911
from one mental institution to the next.

697
00:28:51,914 --> 00:28:54,516
Point is, you're lucky.

698
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:55,645
I'm lucky?

699
00:28:55,648 --> 00:28:57,340
I just wish my past was made up.

700
00:28:57,343 --> 00:28:58,843
What, so you can wake up one day

701
00:28:58,846 --> 00:29:00,690
and realize that you don't
have any family, friends,

702
00:29:00,692 --> 00:29:03,593
or life experiences to hold on to?

703
00:29:03,595 --> 00:29:04,995
Doesn't sound that different

704
00:29:04,997 --> 00:29:07,176
from waking up in a prison cell.

705
00:29:07,179 --> 00:29:08,779
Touché.

706
00:29:10,903 --> 00:29:12,736
Are you two kidding me right now?

707
00:29:12,738 --> 00:29:16,172
Ava, you're a clone from the future,

708
00:29:16,174 --> 00:29:19,776
and you run the Time Travel Bureau.

709
00:29:19,778 --> 00:29:23,313
And you're a witch.

710
00:29:23,315 --> 00:29:25,059
And you escaped a cult

711
00:29:25,062 --> 00:29:27,529
and a real-life demon.

712
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:28,731
I did.

713
00:29:28,734 --> 00:29:31,567
You two are, like, the two coolest women

714
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:33,203
I have ever met,

715
00:29:33,206 --> 00:29:36,292
and I once met Gillian Anderson

716
00:29:36,295 --> 00:29:39,062
at an "X-Files" meet and greet.

717
00:29:39,064 --> 00:29:42,232
Wow. Mona, you are a gem.

718
00:29:42,234 --> 00:29:44,467
You know, we can't have a birthday

719
00:29:44,469 --> 00:29:45,769
without birthday cake.

720
00:29:45,771 --> 00:29:47,070
Yeah!

721
00:29:47,072 --> 00:29:49,192
Back on your feet already, Hank.

722
00:29:49,195 --> 00:29:50,806
Yeah, your gal patched me up good.

723
00:29:50,809 --> 00:29:52,442
I'm just running through our strategy.

724
00:29:52,444 --> 00:29:54,377
Oh, wait, you let him
use our "D&D" miniatures?

725
00:29:54,379 --> 00:29:55,712
No, I didn't let him touch Cyndra,

726
00:29:55,714 --> 00:29:57,033
Lord of the Dark Elves.

727
00:29:57,036 --> 00:29:58,815
You guys "D&D" without me too?

728
00:29:58,817 --> 00:30:01,384
Son, why are you holding a tiny guitar,

729
00:30:01,386 --> 00:30:02,919
or do I even want to know?

730
00:30:02,921 --> 00:30:04,521
Oh, this... this is a lute.

731
00:30:04,523 --> 00:30:06,356
Someone say loot?

732
00:30:06,358 --> 00:30:08,391
This is what we're gonna use
to put the Minotaur to sleep.

733
00:30:08,393 --> 00:30:10,739
- I thought you said that was loot.
- I don't understand.

734
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:12,411
Well, I suppose it is more of a lyre.

735
00:30:12,414 --> 00:30:13,653
Everyone's a liar.

736
00:30:13,656 --> 00:30:15,597
This is how we're gonna
catch our creature, Dad.

737
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,233
- That's your plan?
- Yeah.

738
00:30:17,235 --> 00:30:18,650
We're facing a literal monster.

739
00:30:18,653 --> 00:30:20,684
You think you can
destroy it with a lute?

740
00:30:20,687 --> 00:30:22,028
Well, in the hands of a master,

741
00:30:22,031 --> 00:30:24,676
a lute is a formidable weapon.
Just look at Sting, mate.

742
00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:27,033
Sorry to interrupt, but there's
a change in the timeline.

743
00:30:27,036 --> 00:30:29,078
An attack at Café du Dôme is imminent.

744
00:30:29,081 --> 00:30:30,425
There will be no survivors.

745
00:30:30,428 --> 00:30:32,784
The Minotaur must be
tracking Hemingway's scent.

746
00:30:32,787 --> 00:30:34,653
Let's move out.

747
00:30:34,656 --> 00:30:36,972
Nathaniel, get out of my way.

748
00:30:36,975 --> 00:30:38,988
I don't have to do what
you say anymore, Hank.

749
00:30:38,991 --> 00:30:41,358
Really? Because as your superior,

750
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,065
I'm telling you to stand down.

751
00:30:43,068 --> 00:30:44,868
You're going for the
superior thing again?

752
00:30:44,871 --> 00:30:47,405
You know, you don't want to
listen to me or understand me.

753
00:30:47,408 --> 00:30:51,567
You just... you just
want to be better than me.

754
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:53,670
Well, you're one to
talk about listening.

755
00:30:53,672 --> 00:30:56,673
You've ignored every lesson
I've ever tried to teach you.

756
00:30:56,675 --> 00:30:59,309
Because it's the same
lesson over and over again.

757
00:30:59,311 --> 00:31:01,711
You want me to be more like you, Hank.

758
00:31:01,713 --> 00:31:03,680
But guess what. I'm not like you.

759
00:31:03,682 --> 00:31:06,583
I don't like televised
golf or Tom Clancy books

760
00:31:06,585 --> 00:31:09,052
or '70s folk rock.

761
00:31:09,054 --> 00:31:10,841
I don't know if you happened to notice,

762
00:31:10,844 --> 00:31:14,690
but I'm a grown-ass superhero...

763
00:31:14,693 --> 00:31:19,796
who's just trying to play
the lute for a Minotaur.

764
00:31:19,798 --> 00:31:22,365
Fine, don't want to
listen to your old man?

765
00:31:22,367 --> 00:31:24,911
Maybe you'll listen to your captain.

766
00:31:27,171 --> 00:31:30,039
I'm sorry, but I'm with Nate.

767
00:31:30,042 --> 00:31:33,109
I know his idea sounds
crazy, but he's right.

768
00:31:33,111 --> 00:31:35,578
That's what makes him a Legend,

769
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,814
no matter where he is.

770
00:31:37,816 --> 00:31:40,750
Look, you said you wanted
to see a Legends mission.

771
00:31:40,752 --> 00:31:42,317
Well, you're about to,

772
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,087
and if it goes wrong, well,

773
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:47,424
you go ahead and fire all of us.

774
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:55,419
The beast advanced.

775
00:31:55,422 --> 00:31:58,122
I turned on him, gun raised.

776
00:31:58,124 --> 00:32:00,258
Seeing we'd reached an agreement,

777
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:02,140
- I fired!
- Oh!

778
00:32:02,143 --> 00:32:03,561
So I don't think we'll be seeing

779
00:32:03,563 --> 00:32:05,063
that creature anytime soon.

780
00:32:05,065 --> 00:32:06,731
And what is that?

781
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:12,337
Back for another go, are you?

782
00:32:14,275 --> 00:32:15,726
Oi, fuzz ball, come on.

783
00:32:15,729 --> 00:32:18,142
Have a nice little
whiff of this, will you?

784
00:32:20,947 --> 00:32:22,347
All right, that's your cue.

785
00:32:22,349 --> 00:32:23,781
Okay.

786
00:32:23,783 --> 00:32:26,217
I haven't had much
time to rehearse, but...

787
00:32:36,812 --> 00:32:38,812
Now we end this.

788
00:32:38,815 --> 00:32:40,797
No!

789
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,867
I warn you, I will strike a woman.

790
00:32:44,871 --> 00:32:47,472
That's for being on my summer
eighth grade reading list.

791
00:32:48,857 --> 00:32:51,758
Uh, guys?

792
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:53,161
Nathaniel!

793
00:32:56,216 --> 00:32:58,216
Always preferred Faulkner.

794
00:33:02,455 --> 00:33:05,423
So not a bad birthday, huh?

795
00:33:05,425 --> 00:33:06,724
Considering my original plan

796
00:33:06,726 --> 00:33:08,190
was a "House Hunters" marathon...

797
00:33:08,193 --> 00:33:11,294
That actually sounds pretty great.

798
00:33:13,877 --> 00:33:15,443
You know what?

799
00:33:17,971 --> 00:33:19,704
- You should have this.
- Mm.

800
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:21,939
You know you want to read it.

801
00:33:21,941 --> 00:33:24,242
Look,

802
00:33:24,244 --> 00:33:25,979
I learned from being locked up that

803
00:33:25,982 --> 00:33:28,849
the only way to survive is to shut down.

804
00:33:31,418 --> 00:33:33,318
If you don't have a future,

805
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:36,254
it's best not to look forward.

806
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:39,924
Not to meals or birthdays

807
00:33:39,926 --> 00:33:42,760
or relationships.

808
00:33:43,797 --> 00:33:45,330
Just because this is your present

809
00:33:45,332 --> 00:33:46,938
doesn't mean it has to be your future.

810
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:49,140
Who knows? Maybe someday you can

811
00:33:49,143 --> 00:33:51,336
get out of here without
having to escape.

812
00:33:51,338 --> 00:33:55,740
Yeah, and aren't you glad
you didn't shut down today?

813
00:33:58,878 --> 00:34:00,878
Well, this cake is pretty good.

814
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,481
Come on. Come on. Who
doesn't want to see

815
00:34:03,483 --> 00:34:05,165
a Ray Palmer love letter?

816
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:07,213
You have to open it. There's
probably glitter in it.

817
00:34:07,216 --> 00:34:08,243
I really should...

818
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:09,278
- Open it.
- Come on.

819
00:34:09,281 --> 00:34:11,359
Open it. Open it.

820
00:34:11,362 --> 00:34:12,657
You know what?

821
00:34:16,496 --> 00:34:18,763
Oh, hi there.

822
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:20,865
- Ray?
- Yeah, hi.

823
00:34:20,868 --> 00:34:24,135
Uh, could I get some
help? I'm a little stuck.

824
00:34:33,813 --> 00:34:35,847
- Get behind the bar!
- Good idea.

825
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:42,487
I meant for cover.

826
00:34:42,489 --> 00:34:44,355
Well, I like your version.

827
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,593
Oh!

828
00:34:48,595 --> 00:34:51,262
See, it looks just as I drew it.

829
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:54,165
You leave that weirdo alone!

830
00:34:54,167 --> 00:34:56,033
Your fight is with me!

831
00:34:58,438 --> 00:35:01,973
Toro!

832
00:35:01,975 --> 00:35:03,174
Come on.

833
00:35:03,176 --> 00:35:06,177
Now the dance begins.

834
00:35:07,636 --> 00:35:09,213
I needed to make sure she was okay.

835
00:35:09,215 --> 00:35:11,282
I wanted to make sure you were okay.

836
00:35:11,284 --> 00:35:13,251
Actually, I just really
wanted to see her... you.

837
00:35:13,253 --> 00:35:15,753
And then I thought I'd
deliver the message myself,

838
00:35:15,755 --> 00:35:18,289
but then I got stuck in the glue.

839
00:35:18,291 --> 00:35:19,791
That was sweet.

840
00:35:19,793 --> 00:35:22,226
Stupid but sweet.

841
00:35:22,228 --> 00:35:24,529
No, it's unacceptable

842
00:35:24,531 --> 00:35:28,099
but, in this case, clearly convenient.

843
00:35:28,101 --> 00:35:31,202
So since you are so good at
getting people out of prison,

844
00:35:31,204 --> 00:35:33,137
let's get the hell
out of here, shall we?

845
00:35:33,139 --> 00:35:35,039
Oh. Yeah.

846
00:35:36,709 --> 00:35:39,410
Let's just hope the team
wasn't missing their QB.

847
00:35:42,355 --> 00:35:43,614
That's my boy!

848
00:35:51,464 --> 00:35:53,658

870
00:37:23,883 --> 00:37:25,416
You did good, son.

871
00:37:25,418 --> 00:37:27,852
Right back at you, Dad.

872
00:37:27,854 --> 00:37:30,555
I learned it from you, Nathaniel.

873
00:37:38,868 --> 00:37:41,434
- Hola, Chupi!
- Hola!

874
00:37:41,436 --> 00:37:44,138
- Privet, Baba Yaga.
- Privet.

875
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:48,239
What's up, Nora?

876
00:37:48,242 --> 00:37:50,042
Thought you were headed to Yale.

877
00:37:50,044 --> 00:37:52,011
After last night, I marched home

878
00:37:52,013 --> 00:37:54,580
and told my parents I
didn't want to be a lawyer.

879
00:37:54,582 --> 00:37:56,782
And also that I was craving nachos

880
00:37:56,784 --> 00:37:58,484
and wanted to do karaoke.

881
00:37:58,486 --> 00:38:00,486
The rosé had really
kicked in at that point.

882
00:38:00,488 --> 00:38:04,327
Oh, and here, my mom's homemade congee.

883
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:06,358
Great hangover cure.

884
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:12,264
Hey, can you do me a favor?

885
00:38:13,101 --> 00:38:15,101
I wrote...

886
00:38:15,103 --> 00:38:17,870
I wrote Ray a letter. Uh...

887
00:38:17,872 --> 00:38:20,306
Gah! It'd be an honor to deliver it.

888
00:38:20,308 --> 00:38:24,510
Yeah, anything for my
generation's Ross and Rachel.

889
00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:35,020
Uh, morning, Director Sharpe.

890
00:38:35,022 --> 00:38:36,388
A word, Mona.

891
00:38:37,992 --> 00:38:39,692
What?

892
00:38:39,694 --> 00:38:41,952
Wait, are you firing me this time?

893
00:38:41,955 --> 00:38:43,628
No, Mona.

894
00:38:43,631 --> 00:38:46,332
After yesterday, I realized...

895
00:38:46,335 --> 00:38:49,469
there is some room for a
little humanity in this place.

896
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:54,906
Aloha, Kaupe.

897
00:38:54,909 --> 00:38:56,976
Permission to scratch his tummy?

898
00:38:58,613 --> 00:39:00,713
Permission granted.

899
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:05,251
And you should deliver that letter.

900
00:39:07,387 --> 00:39:10,519
Well, that was a chaotic,

901
00:39:10,522 --> 00:39:12,956
reckless, wasteful mess.

902
00:39:12,959 --> 00:39:15,326
I think I finally see
the value in the Legends.

903
00:39:15,329 --> 00:39:17,195
Yeah, you could have
led with that last part.

904
00:39:17,198 --> 00:39:19,632
We're glad to have you on board.

905
00:39:19,634 --> 00:39:21,964
Well, this has been fun,

906
00:39:21,967 --> 00:39:23,802
but it's time for me to get back.

907
00:39:23,805 --> 00:39:26,472
Yeah, you know what? Um, I'll...

908
00:39:26,474 --> 00:39:28,607
Um, I'll meet you back there, Dad.

909
00:39:33,014 --> 00:39:35,414
He's right. This was fun.

910
00:39:35,416 --> 00:39:36,785
It's good to be back.

911
00:39:36,788 --> 00:39:39,167
Well, the door is always open.

912
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:40,536
You know, coming back here,

913
00:39:40,539 --> 00:39:42,106
I thought it'd be like the old days,

914
00:39:42,109 --> 00:39:43,782
but I don't know what's more surprising,

915
00:39:43,785 --> 00:39:45,925
the fact that so much has changed

916
00:39:45,927 --> 00:39:49,995
or at some point, this
became the old days.

917
00:39:49,997 --> 00:39:52,089
You'd think we of all
people would understand

918
00:39:52,092 --> 00:39:53,675
that time makes no sense.

919
00:39:53,678 --> 00:39:55,166
Yeah.

920
00:39:55,169 --> 00:39:58,170
But I guess it's
something you never accept.

921
00:39:58,172 --> 00:40:00,806
You know I love you guys, right?

922
00:40:00,808 --> 00:40:04,510
But, uh... I belong over there.

923
00:40:04,512 --> 00:40:07,446
I get it.

924
00:40:07,448 --> 00:40:10,316
I'm proud of you.

925
00:40:10,318 --> 00:40:12,785
So go on. Go do your adult thing,

926
00:40:12,787 --> 00:40:14,253
and we'll see you around.

927
00:40:14,256 --> 00:40:15,722
Okay.

928
00:40:17,825 --> 00:40:21,193
Though if you're not in a rush...

929
00:40:22,624 --> 00:40:24,253
It's a pizza party.

930
00:40:24,256 --> 00:40:26,131
Yeah, here he is.

931
00:40:26,133 --> 00:40:29,001
- Hey!
- Welcome back, ugly.

932
00:40:29,003 --> 00:40:31,203
Yes, what other bright ideas
are you gonna leave us with

933
00:40:31,205 --> 00:40:33,128
before you bugger off?

934
00:40:33,131 --> 00:40:34,441
Softball team.

935
00:40:34,444 --> 00:40:36,136
Oh, no, only electronic sports.

936
00:40:36,139 --> 00:40:37,230
Piñata Fridays.

937
00:40:37,233 --> 00:40:40,078
How many times do I
have to say no to that?

938
00:40:40,081 --> 00:40:41,447
Unionizing.

939
00:40:41,449 --> 00:40:43,816
Ooh, don't let Hank hear you say that.

940
00:40:43,818 --> 00:40:46,051
You know, it's still weird
not having you around.

941
00:40:46,053 --> 00:40:47,070
Mm-hmm.

942
00:40:47,073 --> 00:40:48,804
Aw, man, I'll always
be right there, big guy,

943
00:40:48,806 --> 00:40:51,027
- in that giant heart of yours.
- Aw.

944
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:52,663
And I'll be at the Bureau,

945
00:40:52,666 --> 00:40:54,600
so you guys can literally
stop by whenever you want.

946
00:40:54,602 --> 00:40:56,402
Mm.

947
00:40:56,405 --> 00:40:58,529
But, you know, before I go,

948
00:40:58,532 --> 00:41:00,299
I do want to say one thing.

949
00:41:00,301 --> 00:41:02,301
When I first stepped onto this ship,

950
00:41:02,303 --> 00:41:04,670
I was, you know, trying to get away from

951
00:41:04,672 --> 00:41:06,171
all my baggage back home,

952
00:41:06,173 --> 00:41:08,440
and I can't believe I'm gonna say this,

953
00:41:08,442 --> 00:41:10,242
Hemingway once wrote,

954
00:41:10,244 --> 00:41:11,610
"Can't get away from yourself

955
00:41:11,612 --> 00:41:13,913
by moving from one place to another."

956
00:41:13,915 --> 00:41:15,347
- Mm.
- And thanks to you guys,

957
00:41:15,349 --> 00:41:16,715
I don't have to run anymore.

958
00:41:16,717 --> 00:41:18,250
Being here with you all has turned me

959
00:41:18,252 --> 00:41:19,485
into the man I need to be,

960
00:41:19,487 --> 00:41:23,269
and, uh, this place is special.

961
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:25,472
And you never know
when it's gonna be over.

962
00:41:25,475 --> 00:41:28,293
So I say, Legends,

963
00:41:28,296 --> 00:41:30,355
enjoy the ride while it lasts.

964
00:41:30,358 --> 00:41:31,524
Hear, hear.

965
00:41:31,527 --> 00:41:32,871
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

966
00:41:32,874 --> 00:41:35,613
Cheers, cheers, cheers.

967
00:41:35,616 --> 00:41:38,570
Uh, you'll find your place here.

968
00:41:38,572 --> 00:41:39,605
I know I did.

969
00:41:46,433 --> 00:41:52,042
