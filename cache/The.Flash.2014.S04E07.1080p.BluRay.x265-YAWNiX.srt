1
00:00:02,294 --> 00:00:06,004
<i>My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

2
00:00:06,465 --> 00:00:09,299
<i>To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

3
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:12,297
<i>but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

4
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:14,970
<i>I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.</i>

5
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:17,389
<i>But I became lost in time.</i>

6
00:00:17,476 --> 00:00:20,219
<i>It took everything in my
friends' power to bring me back.</i>

7
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:23,350
<i>And in doing so, our world
was opened up to new threats.</i>

8
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:26,145
<i>And I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.</i>

9
00:00:26,235 --> 00:00:28,397
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

10
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:30,736
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

11
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:32,275
Events will align that allow

12
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:34,232
Team Flash the chance
to discover your identity.

13
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:35,316
It is of no concern.

14
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:36,776
I could whip up
a predictive algorithm.

15
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:37,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

16
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:40,197
I can run through
my quantum cerebral chip.

17
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,406
We'll find him in no time.

18
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,243
If you've miscalculated
by even a decimal...

19
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:46,419
There is not a decimal, a fraction,

20
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:50,590
an infinitesimal variable
beyond my thought!

21
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,716
The name we're looking for
is Clifford DeVoe.

22
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:56,422
92% match to our psychological
profile. No other DeVoe comes close.

23
00:00:56,515 --> 00:00:57,881
- Can I help you?
- We were just hoping

24
00:00:57,975 --> 00:01:00,342
to talk with Clifford DeVoe.
Is he here?

25
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02,518
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
How may I be of help?

26
00:01:07,276 --> 00:01:08,858
The effects...

27
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:13,029
...of Taoism...

28
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:18,485
All right, class.
Write your essays on

29
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:20,987
this list of topics.

30
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,494
You have two weeks to complete them.

31
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:27,039
Does anyone have their notes
from earlier?

32
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:29,121
I'm afraid I can't read
my own handwriting.

33
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,761
Class dismissed.

34
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:43,476
I know that look.

35
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:47,521
I felt the same after my 11:00 a.m.

36
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:50,726
Introduction to Fluid Mechanics
and Physical Thermodynamics class.

37
00:01:51,987 --> 00:01:55,276
See, I was trying to explain turbulent
flow rates and, ten minutes in,

38
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:56,697
I wanted to pull my hair out.

39
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:59,070
It's a good thing I know
water flowing to the axis

40
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:01,073
of a tube is called...

41
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:02,324
You better get this right.

42
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:03,450
Laminar.

43
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,491
- So, you do listen.
- To you, always.

44
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:11,087
Nothing matters to them if it's
not digestible in YouTube videos

45
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:14,666
of talking babies
or inane pet tricks.

46
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:18,761
Have you seen the husky singing
"Like a Virgin?"

47
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,756
I made you smile.

48
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,888
How can we enlighten them
if their minds are too small

49
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,186
to handle the gift
of knowledge anymore?

50
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,055
Well, your plan will work.

51
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,141
We just need to re-fashion
the delivery system.

52
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:34,485
It's not the plan that's flawed.
It's my ability to execute it.

53
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:37,439
- Clifford...
- I'm simply not smart enough.

54
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:40,025
You are the most
brilliant mind I know.

55
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:41,199
It's not enough.

56
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:43,827
Not yet.

57
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:45,863
What?

58
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:54,088
At this point it's just a concept.

59
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,086
I call this my thinking cap.

60
00:02:57,511 --> 00:03:01,380
Just like their minds have gotten too
small to handle their full capacity,

61
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:03,135
mine's too small to deliver it.

62
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:08,892
This can change all that...
If you build it, of course.

63
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:16,686
Your dream is my dream.

64
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,651
And your passion is my passion.

65
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:23,701
I'm nothing without you.

66
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,627
I hope it's not too sweet.

67
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:39,592
- This is amazing.
- Just like my wife.

68
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,753
Somehow she finds time
to take care of me

69
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:43,713
and still keep
an immaculate household.

70
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:46,466
And her three-cheese macaroni,
second to none.

71
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,348
Sometimes I think
I'm the luckiest man alive.

72
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,272
Gentlemen, how can I help?

73
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:58,687
The name "DeVoe" came up
in an investigation of ours.

74
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,777
We would just like to ask you
some questions, if that's okay.

75
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:03,824
Why him? DeVoe's a common name.

76
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,951
Yes, I'd wager

77
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:09,076
at least 1,100 individuals,
give or take a few,

78
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,249
with that last name
in the Central City area alone.

79
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,450
The name's been identified

80
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:15,252
for its connection
to four separate criminal cases.

81
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,751
So, you think my husband is
a witness to these crimes?

82
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:20,879
No, we'd like to eliminate him
as a suspect.

83
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,837
- You can't be serious.
- It's all right, Marlize.

84
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:25,755
Do go ahead.

85
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:28,804
So, Professor,
what brought you to Central City?

86
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,760
I grew up in South Africa.

87
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:33,770
And after studying history
and econometrics

88
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:37,066
at the University of Johannesburg,
I took a teaching position at Oxford.

89
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:38,605
That's where we met.

90
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,647
He swept me off my feet.
We've been together ever since.

91
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:46,659
It did take a tenured offer
from Central City University

92
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:48,577
to lure me away
from the Oxford faculty.

93
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:50,655
That was four years ago.

94
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:54,743
Question. Do you know Ramsey Deacon?

95
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,046
No. Should I?

96
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:01,291
What about Becky Sharpe?

97
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,461
- No. I'm afraid not.
- Ralph Dibny?

98
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:10,091
- Mina Chaytan?
- Mina Chaytan. Yeah.

99
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:11,175
That name's familiar.

100
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:13,727
Isn't this the Native-American woman
that left abruptly?

101
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,897
- You know, the anthropologist?
- Yes, I remember.

102
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,731
I was so sad to see her go.

103
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:21,311
You were colleagues.
Did she mention her work?

104
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:25,865
No, but Mina was an animated woman.

105
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,821
Then again, people like us,

106
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:30,574
who see education
as a calling, we often are.

107
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:32,495
That painting...

108
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,458
It's beautiful.

109
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:40,372
The samurai,
they were formidable foes.

110
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:43,754
They'd often make unstoppable enemies
to their opponents.

111
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:46,423
You wouldn't want to cross one.

112
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,968
So you spent time in Japan?

113
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,014
The feudal history of Medieval Japan,
it's one of my areas of expertise.

114
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:55,762
Then you must speak the language.

115
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,988
He also speaks French, Italian,
Mandarin, several other languages.

116
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:09,363
Here's the thing. I love teaching.

117
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,198
It gives me the opportunity
to broaden perspectives.

118
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:15,248
But you can't just inspire people
to be better.

119
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:19,327
You somehow need to change
the way people think.

120
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:24,541
Clifford. My husband is very passionate,
but also needs his rest.

121
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,883
Is there anything else
we can do to help?

122
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:32,799
No. Thank you. If we have any more
questions, we'll get in contact.

123
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,227
- Barr.
- Yeah.

124
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,610
You know where to find me.

125
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,705
Well? Is it him?

126
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:11,045
I don't know, Barr.
This shy college professor

127
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,129
who likes mac-and-cheese

128
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:14,340
doesn't exactly seem like
a criminal mastermind to me.

129
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,050
I mean, come on.
It wouldn't be the first time

130
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,932
somebody played nice, and then
turned out to be our bad guy.

131
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:21,264
The Council of Wells
gave us his name for a reason.

132
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:23,520
- They gave us one name out of...
- 1,100.

133
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,693
1,122, to be precise.

134
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,611
He was off by 22.

135
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,279
I mean, isn't that
a little suspicious?

136
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:30,573
Not if he Googled himself.

137
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,200
I'm just saying there's
something weird about this guy.

138
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,276
He likes samurai.

139
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:37,242
Who doesn't? Have you seen <i>Zatoichi,</i>

140
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:38,743
<i>- The Blind Swordsman?
- ...The Blind Swordsman?</i>

141
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,413
- Best Criterion collection.
- Great box set.

142
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:43,244
- Ever.
- Okay, think about this.

143
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:45,751
If the Council's right,
that means DeVoe arranged for me

144
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,502
to come out of the Speed Force
exactly where he wanted.

145
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,549
- Even you couldn't do that.
- You have a point.

146
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:52,257
- Okay, let's cover all our bases.
- Agreed.

147
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:54,054
Okay, Cisco, Harry, you guys
wanna see what kind of

148
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,927
digital footprint
you can get on this guy.

149
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:57,759
Caitlin, you've got friends at CCU.

150
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,218
Let's see what kind of person
we're dealing with.

151
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,644
- Will do.
- Dad, CCPD,

152
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,767
- background check.
- On it, sweet one.

153
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:04,899
And you...

154
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:08,190
- You all right?
- Yeah.

155
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:10,271
But thank you for asking.

156
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,570
You know, I think Human Resources

157
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,368
might not be okay with this,
us being co-workers and all...

158
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,366
Yeah. I think they'll let it slide,

159
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:21,164
considering I get to marry
the co-worker of my dreams

160
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:22,458
a week from now.

161
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:24,956
You know, sometimes I feel like...

162
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:31,209
- Like what?
- Like I'm the luckiest man alive.

163
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:39,759
<i>Molecular physics,
condensed matter, cosmology,</i>

164
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:44,439
<i>even relativity, all these fields,
will be revolutionized overnight.</i>

165
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:57,569
You've infused my design with life.

166
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:00,112
We still have a problem.

167
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:03,495
There's currently no way to power
a prototype this sophisticated...

168
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:04,951
We'll find a solution.

169
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,411
Expanding a mind
to an infinite capacity

170
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,292
requires an expanding energy source.

171
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,048
Where are we going to find
that kind of power?

172
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:15,253
<i>- Can you tell us how?</i>
- Turn that up.

173
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:18,054
<i>It'll change the way we think about
science, about quantum mechanics,</i>

174
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:23,102
<i>about molecular physics. Once
my particle accelerator goes online</i>

175
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:25,976
<i>it'll blow the doors of science
off their hinges.</i>

176
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,811
<i>That's amazing.</i>

177
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:31,315
We needed a power source
unlike anything imaginable.

178
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,859
Well... It seems

179
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,817
Harrison Wells just imagined it for us.

180
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:40,619
<i>Instantly... Change lives.</i>

181
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:46,705
History moves in cycles.

182
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:50,246
We must, therefore,
learn from what came before us

183
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,504
in order to carve a path
for what's to come.

184
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,755
Because those who don't learn from...

185
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:04,348
Because those who don't learn
from history are doomed to repeat it.

186
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:08,473
Class dismissed.

187
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:11,475
Don't forget your reading material.
Chapter 11,

188
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:14,277
on the counter-culture backlash
and its influence

189
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:16,526
on the Reagan Administration.

190
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,202
Mr. Allen... Twice in one day?

191
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,204
Yeah. I'm sorry to bother you again.

192
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:27,825
Look, I do have a stack
of mid-term exams...

193
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:30,335
Yeah, no. I understand you're busy.
This won't take long.

194
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:31,753
I just wanted to ask...

195
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:36,876
Where were you four years ago
on the night of January 7th?

196
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:41,009
Honestly, Mr. Allen, I have no idea.

197
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,429
How far back does this
investigation of yours go?

198
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:47,303
I'm not at liberty
to discuss that with you.

199
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:50,727
Also, do you ever use public transit?

200
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:55,729
What, like the subway?
I mean, imagine me in a wheelchair...

201
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,188
More like a bus.

202
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:00,608
Is this really necessary?

203
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,534
I'm just being thorough.

204
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:08,661
Fine. I prefer Lyft.
They're wheelchair friendly.

205
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,499
Honestly, Mr. Allen,
how are my vehicle options important,

206
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:14,581
or a date I can hardly remember?

207
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:17,458
I'm just trying to establish
a timeline and solve a mystery.

208
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:20,302
Mysteries are for novelists
and archaeologists.

209
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:23,881
You were supposed to be
ruling me out as a suspect.

210
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:26,676
Instead, it seems like
you've got your guy.

211
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:29,728
No. This is just procedure.

212
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,309
Feels like persecution.

213
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:37,520
Now, can I get back to you or do I
need to accompany you downtown?

214
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,985
No, of course not.

215
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:51,284
Just email me.
And again, I'm sorry to bother you.

216
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:14,352
So this is an example of meta DNA.

217
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,105
This is the DNA
you brought me from DeVoe.

218
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:18,689
It's completely normal.

219
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:20,771
Do you see all the differences?

220
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,066
Clifford DeVoe is not a meta.

221
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,281
Did you two find anything?

222
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,825
Well, he's never been arrested,

223
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,454
he pays all his taxes
and his mortgage,

224
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:34,660
he has a very reasonable 401k plan.

225
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,371
Donates to the Sierra Club,
volunteers at an orphanage,

226
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,047
is a Big Brother.

227
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:40,466
Dad didn't find anything either.

228
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:43,544
He says that he's an
upstanding member of the community.

229
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:45,421
Yeah, I talked
to some friends at Oxford.

230
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:47,472
They said DeVoe's
a little absent-minded,

231
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:48,548
but everybody likes him.

232
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:52,102
Guys, I'm telling you Clifford DeVoe,
he's not what he seems.

233
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:55,101
That could just be the wheelchair.
I mean,

234
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,853
- you do kinda have a bad history...
- No!

235
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:57,933
That wasn't me.

236
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,859
Come on. He's too perfect.

237
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:03,110
Okay, I just... I've a strong feeling
that he's hiding something.

238
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,190
You don't believe me.

239
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,026
No, it's not that
we don't believe you, Barry.

240
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,239
It's just... Right now,
DeVoe seems like a good guy.

241
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:12,623
Guys, it's him.

242
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:15,743
I thought we were done just
assuming people are villains.

243
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,167
All right, you know what? Vibe it.

244
00:13:19,191 --> 00:13:21,191
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

245
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,071
Oh, my God!

246
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,286
You were right.

247
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,952
That mac-and-cheese
looks unbelievable.

248
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:56,329
See, that doesn't sound
very villainous, does it?

249
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:58,832
Barry, can I talk to you outside?

250
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:03,795
Okay, so do you wanna tell me
what's really bothering you?

251
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:06,677
My spidey sense is just tingling
way off the charts.

252
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,921
Barry, is there any chance
that this is about the wedding?

253
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:11,302
- I mean, maybe you're feeling...
- No, I'm not nervous.

254
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,554
But you're not acting
the way that you normally do.

255
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:17,513
Look, Savitar and Kadabra warned us
about someone named DeVoe.

256
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,433
This DeVoe guy
could be behind everything.

257
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,772
The bus metas. Me coming out
of the Speed Force

258
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,694
at the wrong place. The Samuroid.

259
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:26,814
Barry, is there a possibility

260
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:28,820
that you were so determined
to find the bad guy

261
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,242
and get ahead of everything
that you're seeing things

262
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:31,614
exactly the way you wanna see them?

263
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:32,911
No, I...

264
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,323
Maybe. I don't know...

265
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:41,749
Look. In seven days, I am going
to marry the man that I love.

266
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:44,673
But right now I have to lock down
a new DJ,

267
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:45,749
because the last one got fired

268
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,084
for drinking too much
and wouldn't stop dancing

269
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:48,168
with the father of the bride.

270
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:50,345
Joe might be into that actually.

271
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,388
Which is exactly why
I need to go home.

272
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:54,891
And I would really like your help.

273
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,443
Ready for the press conference?

274
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:08,314
Absolutely.

275
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:10,528
Yeah.

276
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:15,870
Thank you.

277
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:20,247
My name is Harrison Wells.
Tonight... The future begins.

278
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:23,705
The work my team and I will do here

279
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:25,585
will change our understanding

280
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:28,839
of physics, will bring about
advancements in power,

281
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,420
advancements in medicine,
it'll bring about advancements.

282
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,847
Period. This is the future.

283
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:37,810
And trust me, it'll be here
faster than you think.

284
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,305
What does it mean to you?

285
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,729
Hey! My laptop.
It's got my dissertation!

286
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,070
Well, it would appear
tonight's entertainment

287
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:50,819
is not limited to the stage.

288
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:54,531
What's the first thing you'll do
once the accelerator is online?

289
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:57,412
Crack open an expensive bottle
of Dom Perignon with my staff.

290
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,740
I ride them very hard,
and they've earned it. Yes?

291
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:02,622
Those protesting this accelerator
believe it could

292
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:05,045
open a black hole in Central City.

293
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:08,666
But is it not more likely to cause
a benevolent phenomenon

294
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,671
like a Higgs-Boson bridge?

295
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:13,504
The only phenomenon
that will occur this evening

296
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:15,965
is one that has been calculated
to the tiniest detail

297
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,266
to the tiniest decimal point.

298
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:21,140
So you've foreseen
every possible outcome?

299
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,680
Yes, I have, Miss...

300
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,644
Mrs. Marlize DeVoe.

301
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,520
DeVoe...

302
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:32,114
DeVoe.

303
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,613
I expect that would make the
gentleman to your right

304
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:35,783
your husband.

305
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,029
Clifford DeVoe.

306
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,995
I'm a big fan of your work.

307
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:47,292
Sir, I believe it'll have
an enormous impact on our future.

308
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:51,800
Thank you for coming.
And, Professor... Good luck.

309
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:58,848
Wells is lying.

310
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,473
He knows
the accelerator won't succeed.

311
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:03,395
He'd risk an explosion?

312
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:06,269
No. I think he wants one.
Only the fallout from dark matter

313
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,566
being released into the atmosphere

314
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:09,894
will produce variants
we cannot yet predict.

315
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:11,444
We need to delay our plan.

316
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:14,319
No. This is even better.
We'll have all the power we need.

317
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:15,774
No, it's too risky.

318
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:18,569
I'm willing to take the chance.

319
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:20,746
The blast is the only thing
that can power the cap.

320
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:23,452
We should wait.
Try and find another way.

321
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:26,077
This is the only way.

322
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:35,796
Shut it down! Shut it down!

323
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:38,760
<i>Shut it down! Shut it down!</i>

324
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:43,301
Ready, my love?

325
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:45,270
In position.

326
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:48,398
Shut it down! Shut it down!

327
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:02,988
It's starting.

328
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:29,598
What's happening?

329
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:36,980
Clifford!

330
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,490
Clifford!

331
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:50,669
Clifford!

332
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:53,588
Clifford!

333
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:02,924
Clifford! No... No, no.

334
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,347
Don't you dare leave me.

335
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,781
I thought I'd lost you.

336
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:33,162
How do you feel?

337
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:36,835
Enlightened.

338
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,937
Hey, Allen. Singh wants to see you.

339
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,013
One second.

340
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:54,395
I don't know, Allen.
Singh's making that face again.

341
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:55,475
You might wanna hurry.

342
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,150
Trust me, I understand.

343
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,156
- Mr. Allen.
- What's this?

344
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:04,822
- Close the door, please.
- Yeah.

345
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:08,239
Continue, Professor.

346
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,747
First my home, then my classroom.
What's next,

347
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,878
our bedroom where we sleep?

348
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:17,497
Joe and I just wanted...

349
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,628
On behalf of the Central City
Police Department,

350
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:22,757
I'd like to extend our sincerest
apologies for this intrusion.

351
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:26,055
Mr. Allen?

352
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,303
Yeah, I'm sorry
for disturbing you, Mr. DeVoe.

353
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:32,680
Professor DeVoe.

354
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,060
Thank you for coming in.

355
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:44,866
What the hell were they doing here?

356
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:46,739
They just filed
a complaint against you.

357
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:48,361
Said you harassed them.

358
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:49,697
No, I wasn't harassing them.

359
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,156
Why are you bothering them at all?

360
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:53,162
It's a case we're working on.

361
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,242
What case?

362
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,669
- It's something that...
- Do me a favor.

363
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,876
Stay away from the nice professor
and his wife.

364
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,333
Captain, DeVoe seems very...

365
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:02,417
Very what?

366
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:06,005
And unless the answer is
"guilty of a very specific crime,"

367
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,885
you are way off base.

368
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:09,928
So are you, Joe.

369
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:11,934
You should know better than that.

370
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,854
We don't just show up at someone's
house and start asking questions.

371
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,556
We follow protocol.

372
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,451
Anybody home?

373
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,410
Hey.

374
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:40,672
Hi. Dad said
you were having a bad day, so...

375
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:43,466
What? No. I'm fine. I'm great,
actually. How are you doing?

376
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,175
What?

377
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:50,174
What are you...

378
00:21:58,526 --> 00:21:59,607
What is this?

379
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:03,111
His wife, Iris. She's helping him.

380
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,192
No, listen. Okay, look.

381
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:08,525
She's not Susie Homemaker with her
perfect mac-and-cheese,

382
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:11,532
she's a Stepford wife.
She's got two doctorates, you know?

383
00:22:11,622 --> 00:22:14,490
One in mechanical engineering
and another in advanced robotics.

384
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:15,699
That's how they work.

385
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:17,910
He comes up with the plans,
but she executes them.

386
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,710
She's some kind of mechanical genius.

387
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,626
So you think DeVoe
and his wife are super-villains?

388
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,666
- Yes.
- Listen to yourself, Barry.

389
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,750
What?

390
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:27,882
DeVoe's already filed
a complaint against you.

391
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:29,338
I know, I...

392
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:33,846
Look. Cisco, Harry,
my Dad, Caitlin...

393
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:37,228
They're the best and they have
found nothing on DeVoe.

394
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,272
We're getting married
in a week, Barry.

395
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:46,067
Please, for the sake
of your job and my sanity,

396
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,607
please, let it go.

397
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:04,380
I've solved them.

398
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:06,966
Solved what?

399
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:11,047
Riemann's Hypothesis,
Hilbert's Fifteenth Problem.

400
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:15,263
The Standard Conjectures on Algebraic
Cycles, and the list goes on.

401
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,682
Clifford, this is incredible.

402
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:20,642
Ask me anything.

403
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:23,478
Who was Jack the Ripper?

404
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:26,103
The prevailing theory
is there was a London barber

405
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:28,609
by the name Aaron Kosminski
who committed the crimes.

406
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:31,783
He also suffered schizophrenic
and delusional tendencies.

407
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:34,778
But...

408
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:39,826
It was his nurse at the Colney Hatch
Asylum, Catherine Jewell.

409
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:42,410
It's like every little bit

410
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:44,666
of knowledge now
resides inside my brain.

411
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:47,040
I know every answer
to every question ever asked.

412
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:48,796
You're incredible.

413
00:23:48,886 --> 00:23:50,002
We're incredible.

414
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:51,837
You made all this possible.

415
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:54,673
We now finally have
the means to bring to the world...

416
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:58,927
Clifford, are you okay? Clifford.

417
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:02,522
Clifford... Clifford.

418
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,170
What are you hiding, DeVoe?

419
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:31,504
Imagine your body is a river.

420
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:33,881
There's a dam blocking your legs.

421
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:37,426
My gastrocnemius muscles
are degenerating, aren't they?

422
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:39,303
Well, yes.

423
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:43,391
- The symptoms are similar to...
- Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

424
00:26:43,644 --> 00:26:47,979
But your muscles are decaying faster
and more rapidly than typical ALS.

425
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,183
I believe this is something else.

426
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:54,189
Is that your medical diagnosis?
That I have a case of something else?

427
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:57,689
It's just, we've never seen
a case like yours before.

428
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:04,613
An increase in complex
fasciculation potential

429
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:08,040
explains the axonal membrane
hyperexcitability, but it doesn't...

430
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:10,953
Of course.

431
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:13,875
When gamma wave activity
exceeds 50 hertz,

432
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:17,130
my acetylcholine receptors draw away
from my nerve receptors

433
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:19,631
instead of toward them.

434
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,217
What did you say
you're a professor of?

435
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:24,049
History.

436
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,846
What's his prognosis?

437
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:31,356
Life expectancy for typical ALS
is about two to five years.

438
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:33,728
In this chrono dispersion,
it'll be half that.

439
00:27:35,112 --> 00:27:37,570
Complete paralysis will come first.

440
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,651
Excuse us, please.

441
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:46,616
This doesn't make sense.

442
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,453
My mind is drawing energy
from my body.

443
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:53,415
Like a parasite feeding
on an ailing host.

444
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:57,499
We're so close to everything
we've ever dreamed of,

445
00:27:58,051 --> 00:28:00,008
only for it to be ripped away
by this body.

446
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,927
No, no, no...

447
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:06,223
We can stop this, Clifford.
I'll never give up.

448
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:09,640
2,600 individuals
developed the meta gene

449
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:13,349
and they use it to rob jewelry stores
and summon tornadoes.

450
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:16,059
I use mine to save humanity
and I'm condemned?

451
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:20,396
Dying wasn't part of our plan.

452
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:30,115
Guys, I found a camera
in the Samuroid head.

453
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:31,408
Where did it lead back to?

454
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:32,742
Where do you think?

455
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:33,952
DeVoe.

456
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:37,084
So, you pinged the camera to his
computer's IP address? Good.

457
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:39,632
Well, no, I didn't ping it.

458
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:41,876
Well, then, how did you
figure out it was him?

459
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,506
- Well...
- This camera isn't even active.

460
00:28:43,931 --> 00:28:45,297
No. I heard it.
It was making a noise.

461
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,551
- Noise?
- Yeah.

462
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:48,304
Inside the Samuroid head.

463
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,726
It was buzzing and then
I found that thing inside.

464
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:52,348
He's been watching us for weeks.

465
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:54,772
And I could've proved it,
but his wife came back too soon.

466
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:58,108
Too soon? From where?

467
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,936
- I don't...
- Barry...

468
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,237
Tell me you did not
break into their house.

469
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:04,031
Well...

470
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:05,533
- Wow, okay.
- No.

471
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:07,576
Guys... No, that sounds bad.

472
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:09,871
You have to listen to me.
This guy wants us to think

473
00:29:09,957 --> 00:29:12,199
he's unassuming and weak.
But he's not.

474
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:13,703
He's powerful and smart.

475
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:15,330
And he's been ahead of us
every step of the way.

476
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,707
- He's ahead of us right now.
- Easy, Allen. Calm down.

477
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:19,084
- I'm fine.
- Okay.

478
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:21,712
Hey. We just don't want you to do
anything else you'll regret.

479
00:29:21,802 --> 00:29:23,213
Anything else?
What do you mean? What have I done?

480
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:25,545
For starters, breaking and entering.

481
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:28,347
Oh, my God! I don't understand
why you don't see what's going on.

482
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:31,468
He probably has cameras everywhere.
At the lab, at CCPD.

483
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:33,644
I mean, he's always watching us.

484
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,932
Hey, Joe. What is it?

485
00:29:39,653 --> 00:29:41,815
- Hey, I found something.
- Barr, stop.

486
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:44,439
I just don't feel safe anymore,
you know?

487
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:47,776
I mean, I thought the police
were supposed to protect people.

488
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:51,533
I haven't done anything to you.

489
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,285
You broke into our home.

490
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:01,539
We're good people.
We don't deserve this.

491
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,792
I don't want you to worry anymore.

492
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:07,258
Mr. Allen will stop all of this
immediately, I assure you.

493
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:17,809
Stay away from us.

494
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,899
I told you to stay away
from those people.

495
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:26,109
Captain, you have to listen to me...

496
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:28,316
You're taking two weeks off.
And that is not a request.

497
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:29,696
You're suspending me?

498
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:31,660
You're lucky I'm not arresting you.

499
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:37,583
Use your time away to consider
your future in law enforcement.

500
00:30:55,729 --> 00:30:58,016
- What is this?
- A restraining order.

501
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:01,645
I have to stay 500 feet away
from Clifford DeVoe.

502
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,396
And are you going to?

503
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:07,521
Barry.

504
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:12,027
This is not you. You've gotta stop.

505
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:13,994
- I can't.
- You can't or you won't?

506
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:15,492
I don't know anymore.

507
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,533
I've faced a lot of bad guys.

508
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:21,202
People that would hurt
the ones that I love,

509
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:24,206
destroy everything good in the world,
and think nothing of it.

510
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:28,634
But this guy, he feels more dangerous
than all the others combined.

511
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:31,470
And we still barely know
anything about him.

512
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:33,514
It scares the hell out of me, Iris.

513
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,217
Barry, how many times have we been
up against the unknown?

514
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:38,352
- This is different.
- How?

515
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:45,143
Ever since I came back
from the Speed Force,

516
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:49,402
I have been constantly
and genuinely happy.

517
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:54,486
My friends are safe.
Joe is going to be a dad again.

518
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:58,372
And, next week, I get to
marry the love of my life.

519
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:03,248
I have more to lose now
than ever before.

520
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:09,710
Yeah, but... What about
after Cecile has the baby?

521
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,422
Or after we get married? Or...

522
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:16,048
Even when we have our first child?

523
00:32:18,145 --> 00:32:21,934
You know, as time goes by, there's
gonna be even more for us to lose.

524
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:24,815
And people are always
gonna be coming after us.

525
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:27,192
You can't let that consume you.

526
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:30,522
You just have to live in the moment
and face it as it comes.

527
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:33,483
How are you not scared?

528
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:41,365
Because we're the Flash.

529
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:15,196
Clifford? Clifford. Clifford.

530
00:33:15,285 --> 00:33:16,742
Get away from me.

531
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:19,036
I'm trying to help you.

532
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:23,578
If you really wish to help, construct
a temporal vortex distortion chamber

533
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:26,581
and prevent me from ever
becoming this atrocity.

534
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,003
This is what we wanted.

535
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:31,503
I cannot grab a damn book
from the shelf!

536
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,392
What am I, Marlize?

537
00:33:47,317 --> 00:33:49,400
You are my husband.

538
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,565
Your husband is gone.

539
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:54,234
No.

540
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:57,278
Let me die.

541
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:22,592
I'm not going anywhere.

542
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,848
This body will expire.

543
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:33,569
It will last longer with this.

544
00:34:51,673 --> 00:34:54,666
You are in violation
of a restraining order, Mr. Allen.

545
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:58,507
Well, you could call the cops.

546
00:34:59,973 --> 00:35:01,589
Do you intend to harm me?

547
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,592
Then pray, do tell,

548
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:07,599
what is so paramount
that you'd risk incarceration?

549
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:10,518
I wanted to look you
in the eyes and ask...

550
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:14,902
Who are you, really?

551
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:31,869
Who's asking?

552
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:34,872
Barry Allen...

553
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:39,343
Or the Flash?

554
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:42,220
- How did you...
- Oh, please.

555
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:46,343
Your little secret was one
of the more underwhelming revelations

556
00:35:46,436 --> 00:35:47,643
I have uncovered.

557
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:52,440
I was born the same evening you were,
January 7th.

558
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:55,438
The night S.T.A.R. Labs'
particle accelerator

559
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:58,896
bathed Central City
in gene-altering dark matter.

560
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,194
We were both struck by lightning.

561
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:02,866
I knew you were affected.

562
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,116
How did our tests
not show your meta DNA?

563
00:36:06,206 --> 00:36:08,323
For such a fast man,
you're rather slow.

564
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:09,741
I'm smarter than you.

565
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:13,703
You and your "science team"

566
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:18,086
have devised no strategy, no action,
no coordinated effort

567
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,418
for which I'm not already prepared.

568
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,801
The Samuroid.

569
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:25,890
The bus metas. It was you.

570
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,467
But why reveal yourself now?

571
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:31,728
Because I have nothing
to fear from you.

572
00:36:32,065 --> 00:36:35,103
Yeah? I'd think twice about that.

573
00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:38,311
I have a team of some
of the smartest minds from across

574
00:36:38,405 --> 00:36:39,771
- the multiverse.
- Yes.

575
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,730
Your Council of Wells.

576
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:46,869
Could any one of those clowns
identify what my abilities are?

577
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:51,658
You could gather every genius
on every planet

578
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:54,209
and you still couldn't out-think me.

579
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:57,713
Plenty of metas have come after me,

580
00:36:58,007 --> 00:37:01,125
the people that I love. You know
the one thing they have in common?

581
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:03,381
They failed.

582
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:06,050
You've done wonders all these years

583
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:08,599
punching gorillas
with rudimentary powers.

584
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:11,101
Chasing mad men shooting icicles.

585
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:16,562
Those were children with
play guns. Savitar. Zoom. Thawne.

586
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:22,146
Their powers are nothing compared
to the power of limitless thought.

587
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:25,358
That's your ability.

588
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:29,446
Your intellect was amplified
by the particle accelerator.

589
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:32,619
You may be
the fastest man alive, Allen,

590
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,453
I'm the fastest mind.

591
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,009
So this is how we begin whatever
twisted game you have planned.

592
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:50,557
No, Mr. Allen. You've already lost
and you never even realized it.

593
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:56,264
Congratulations on
your upcoming nuptials.

594
00:37:58,026 --> 00:37:59,437
I'll be thinking of you.

595
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:08,988
There is something
I need to tell you.

596
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,327
I confronted DeVoe.

597
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:12,739
Oh, come on! Barry,
he could get you arrested.

598
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:14,198
No. He won't. He wanted me to come.

599
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,282
How do you know?

600
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:17,208
Well, for starters,
he knows I'm the Flash.

601
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:21,623
So, you were right all along.

602
00:38:22,509 --> 00:38:23,670
We didn't believe you.

603
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,750
I'm sorry.

604
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:27,257
Don't be.
DeVoe's been playing all of us.

605
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:28,591
How?

606
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,930
It's his powers. He has

607
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:33,346
an intelligence beyond anything
we could have imagined.

608
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:35,970
He's orchestrated everything
that we've encountered.

609
00:38:36,189 --> 00:38:37,555
He's moved us like chess pieces

610
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:39,185
in a game we didn't even know
we were playing.

611
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:41,684
How do we stop someone
who has super intelligence?

612
00:38:41,778 --> 00:38:43,235
We're pretty smart.

613
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:44,520
Maybe we're not.

614
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:55,447
The Thinker.

615
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:58,416
It's good. Apt sense of menace.
Nailed it in one.

616
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:00,498
Guys, it's gonna take all of us
to stop him.

617
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:04,085
Sounds like y'all could use a hand.

618
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:07,418
Wally!

619
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:11,005
- Good to see you, Son.
- You, too.

620
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:13,758
How was Blue Valley?

621
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:19,100
Self-reflection and a battle
with a starfish from outer space

622
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,064
gives you perspective.

623
00:39:21,234 --> 00:39:22,645
So you found
what you were looking for?

624
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:24,401
I don't know, to be honest.

625
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:27,738
Well, we are glad you're home.

626
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:30,691
Looks like you found
the guy behind the bus metas.

627
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:31,821
Yeah.

628
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:34,824
So, you wanna suit up, take him down?

629
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:37,327
No. Now, it's his move.

630
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,868
But I think we take our time.
Formulate a plan.

631
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:43,962
What now, boss lady?

632
00:39:46,426 --> 00:39:47,633
We get married.

633
00:39:50,013 --> 00:39:52,630
He came to you.
Just like you said he would.

634
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:56,092
He's finally seized control
of his fear.

635
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:01,559
He drew his strength
from those he calls "friends."

636
00:40:02,692 --> 00:40:04,024
Sounds like you admire him.

637
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:09,192
It is fascinating. In the chain
of 4,900 possible events I predicted,

638
00:40:09,282 --> 00:40:12,241
there was one which resulted
in them calling me "The Teacher."

639
00:40:14,704 --> 00:40:16,411
I prefer "The Thinker."

640
00:40:17,624 --> 00:40:20,617
They will be the first to experience
the enlightenment.

641
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:24,210
You've been unplugged for too long.

642
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:30,334
I'm nothing without you.

643
00:40:37,894 --> 00:40:39,010
Proceed.

644
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:22,762
Your body's deteriorating faster
than the chair can handle.

645
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:24,596
It will survive long enough.

646
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:29,105
You're really gonna let them
get married?

647
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:33,193
What is knowledge without love?

648
00:41:33,217 --> 00:41:41,217
