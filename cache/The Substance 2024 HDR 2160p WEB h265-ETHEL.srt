1
00:02:54,792 --> 00:02:55,958
- Elisabeth!
- Elisabeth!

2
00:02:57,833 --> 00:02:59,042
We love you Elisabeth!

3
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:00,083
Please!

4
00:03:00,167 --> 00:03:01,167
Over here!

5
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,417
Oh my God, we love you!

6
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:12,000
...my favorite.

7
00:03:12,542 --> 00:03:15,333
- Wanna get something to eat?
- Yeah, I'll get a pretzel, or something.

8
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:23,083
- Remember her?
- She was in that movie...

9
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,458
We're gonna have to let her know
we're gonna be late.

10
00:03:31,542 --> 00:03:32,625
Yeah, I'll give her a text.

11
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:38,167
He owes me 20 bucks.

12
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:55,917
Get out the way!

13
00:03:56,042 --> 00:03:57,125
<i>Vamos !</i>

14
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:01,125
Shit!

15
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,250
You got it!

16
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,375
Feel that power, ladies!

17
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:38,875
And march! Get those knees up.

18
00:04:39,042 --> 00:04:40,042
You got it!

19
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,083
Come on!

20
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:45,708
Front.

21
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:47,042
Kick!

22
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:48,792
Kick!

23
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:50,875
Oh yeah, you got it!

24
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:52,875
Square.

25
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:54,750
Think about those bikini bods.

26
00:04:54,917 --> 00:04:57,708
You wanna look
like a giant jellyfish on the beach?

27
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,500
Come on.

28
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,250
Cross.

29
00:05:01,917 --> 00:05:03,042
Push.

30
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,958
Kick!
Come on, you got it!

31
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,375
Hang in there, ladies, you've got it.

32
00:05:10,917 --> 00:05:12,542
You've got it!

33
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,500
Great workout, ladies.

34
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:22,708
<i>Alright, I hope I see you next week
for Sparkle Your Life.</i>

35
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,417
We're gonna work on
the lateral abs,

36
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:26,875
you know,
the most difficult part to sculpt.

37
00:05:27,042 --> 00:05:28,458
But in the meantime,

38
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,208
take care of yourself.

39
00:05:35,167 --> 00:05:36,417
Move it back, position one.

40
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:37,833
Great job, ladies.

41
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,500
You got it.

42
00:05:39,542 --> 00:05:41,083
Alright take these down for me.

43
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,708
- Happy birthday!
- Oh, thank you.

44
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:06,917
- Happy birthday.
- Oh, thank you.

45
00:06:07,042 --> 00:06:09,417
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

46
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:33,792
I don't care if we have to see every
fucking young girl in this fucking town

47
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,417
in the next few weeks.

48
00:06:35,917 --> 00:06:38,583
Look, I'll make it simple.

49
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,417
We need her young.

50
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:42,667
We need her hot.

51
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:44,500
We need her now.

52
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:48,375
How the old bitch has been able
to stick around for this long,

53
00:06:48,417 --> 00:06:50,625
that's the fucking mystery to me.

54
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,625
Oh, Oscar winner my ass.

55
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:56,292
When was that? Back in the 30s,

56
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:58,667
<i>what, for King Kong ?</i>

57
00:07:01,167 --> 00:07:02,417
<i>- ...promised her...
- No.</i>

58
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:06,375
I don't give a fuck
what we promised her!

59
00:07:06,917 --> 00:07:10,083
This is network TV,
not a fucking charity.

60
00:07:11,292 --> 00:07:13,375
Find me somebody new!

61
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,083
Now!

62
00:07:16,417 --> 00:07:21,958
Hey, did you know that a woman's fertility
starts to decrease about the age of 25?

63
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:23,917
How old is Jennifer?

64
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,875
You better get busy!

65
00:08:02,792 --> 00:08:05,542
<i>It's like when you see
someone fart on screen.</i>

66
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:11,833
People just love that.

67
00:08:12,667 --> 00:08:14,250
I mean, that's just the way it is.

68
00:08:16,167 --> 00:08:17,333
<i>C'est la vie.</i>

69
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,125
People are just people.

70
00:08:19,292 --> 00:08:22,708
And I have to give people
what they want.

71
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:24,917
That's what keeps the shareholders happy.

72
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:28,750
And people always ask
for something new.

73
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:30,792
Renewal

74
00:08:31,542 --> 00:08:32,833
is inevitable.

75
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:35,167
And at 50...

76
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:36,750
well...

77
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,333
it stops.

78
00:08:40,167 --> 00:08:41,625
What stops?

79
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,292
What?

80
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,333
What stops?

81
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:49,792
you know, the...

82
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:59,167
Oh, George!

83
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,167
I'm sorry, I gotta run.

84
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,417
Harvey!

85
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:06,625
George, those ratings are insane!

86
00:09:07,792 --> 00:09:09,333
You're a genius!

87
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,333
Oh what a man, you're a genius!

88
00:09:13,042 --> 00:09:14,583
Let's buy you a drink, come on.

89
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,750
WITH TOOTH BRIGHT
YOU GOT IT!

90
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:06,625
Well, it's your lucky day, Miss Sparkle

91
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:08,708
'cause we have X-rayed
you from head to toe,

92
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,833
and you don't have so much
as a cracked molar.

93
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,750
So, you are good to go.

94
00:10:14,917 --> 00:10:16,750
Vaccination, okay.

95
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:19,125
Not currently on any medication.

96
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:21,750
By the way, I just want to say, my...

97
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:24,042
my wife is a huge fan.

98
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:29,250
Blood type...

99
00:10:29,292 --> 00:10:31,125
Oh hey, it's your birthday!

100
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:32,333
Happy bir--

101
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:45,583
Oh, uh, that's an emergency,
I'm sorry, I have to...

102
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:47,167
Have a good...

103
00:10:47,917 --> 00:10:49,000
Bye.

104
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:57,583
One moment.

105
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:00,750
There's just
one last exam to perform.

106
00:11:00,917 --> 00:11:02,667
I thought he said
I was good to go.

107
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:26,833
- Is there a problem?
- No, it's perfect.

108
00:11:27,542 --> 00:11:28,833
You're a good candidate.

109
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:31,625
I mean, you're good to go.

110
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,958
I wish you the best.

111
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:15,667
Lizzie?

112
00:12:17,292 --> 00:12:18,750
Lizzie Sparkle?

113
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:20,917
Oh my God, I can't believe it.

114
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,167
Fred!

115
00:12:25,292 --> 00:12:27,750
Fred, from 10th grade homeroom!

116
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,833
Fred, of course!

117
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,750
You haven't changed a bit.

118
00:12:35,292 --> 00:12:38,708
You're still the most beautiful girl
in the whole wide world.

119
00:12:39,417 --> 00:12:41,875
You know, I followed your career.
What a success! I mean...

120
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:44,583
Wow, wow, wow!

121
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:46,083
Wow.

122
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:47,208
Hey...

123
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,750
Why don't we go out
maybe for a drink some time?

124
00:12:49,792 --> 00:12:52,083
Now that we're,
you know, "reconnected".

125
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:54,875
- Oh, of course,
- I'm...

126
00:12:55,042 --> 00:12:56,875
- I'm stupid, you're super busy.
- But you know what?

127
00:12:56,917 --> 00:12:59,333
Why don't you give me your card?

128
00:12:59,417 --> 00:13:01,083
I mean, you never know.

129
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:03,042
Here...

130
00:13:03,417 --> 00:13:04,708
This will do.

131
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,833
Don't look at my cholesterol levels,
they're a disaster.

132
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:12,583
- Oh, God!
- Oh, that's...

133
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,083
There.

134
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:19,958
Now, you've got it!

135
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:24,833
Call me.

136
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:16,167
<i>Have you ever dreamt
of a better version of yourself?</i>

137
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:21,083
<i>Younger.</i>

138
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,042
<i>More beautiful.</i>

139
00:14:23,292 --> 00:14:24,833
<i>More perfect.</i>

140
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:29,292
<i>One single injection
unlocks your DNA.</i>

141
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:32,292
<i>Starting a new cellular division.</i>

142
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:35,167
<i>That will release
another version of yourself.</i>

143
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,000
<i>This is...</i>

144
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:39,250
<i>The Substance.</i>

145
00:14:39,917 --> 00:14:41,417
<i>You are the matrix.</i>

146
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,375
<i>Everything comes from you.</i>

147
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:46,875
<i>And everything is you.</i>

148
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:50,583
<i>This is simply
a better version of yourself.</i>

149
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:52,458
<i>You just have to share.</i>

150
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:54,500
<i>One week for one.</i>

151
00:14:54,667 --> 00:14:56,417
<i>And one week for the other.</i>

152
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:59,583
<i>A perfect balance of seven days each.</i>

153
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,125
<i>The one and only thing not to forget.</i>

154
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,875
<i>You are one.</i>

155
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,000
<i>You can't escape from yourself.</i>

156
00:15:25,917 --> 00:15:29,083
<i>You slip through my fingers</i>

157
00:15:31,917 --> 00:15:34,833
<i>And you drop to the ground</i>

158
00:15:37,917 --> 00:15:41,208
<i>You fade away</i>

159
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:48,083
<i>Fade away</i>

160
00:17:02,917 --> 00:17:03,917
<i>Here, Elisabeth...</i>

161
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:05,583
<i>Elisabeth, we love you!</i>

162
00:17:06,917 --> 00:17:07,958
<i>We love you...</i>

163
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:31,958
<i>Yes?</i>

164
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:33,083
Hello.

165
00:17:35,042 --> 00:17:36,333
I'd like...

166
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,333
to order.

167
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:41,708
<i>Address?</i>

168
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,750
1057 Beverly Canyon.

169
00:17:47,417 --> 00:17:50,958
<i>Write this down,
35 North Byron Alley.</i>

170
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:53,583
35 North...

171
00:23:48,917 --> 00:23:51,208
<i>You are the matrix.</i>

172
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:53,583
<i>Everything comes from you.</i>

173
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:56,458
<i>And everything is you.</i>

174
00:23:57,375 --> 00:23:58,917
<i>This is simply</i>

175
00:23:59,417 --> 00:24:01,833
<i>a better version of yourself.</i>

176
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:20,000
Hello.

177
00:37:02,708 --> 00:37:03,792
Thanks.

178
00:37:03,833 --> 00:37:05,125
We'll let you know by next week.

179
00:37:05,375 --> 00:37:08,458
Thank you so much.
I'm just dying to get the part.

180
00:37:14,083 --> 00:37:15,417
Great dancer.

181
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:20,833
Too bad her boobs aren't in the middle
of her face instead of that nose.

182
00:37:22,958 --> 00:37:24,042
Next!

183
00:37:37,792 --> 00:37:41,500
Looks like everything
sure is in the right place this time.

184
00:37:41,917 --> 00:37:44,750
Please say your name,
age, measurements.

185
00:37:58,958 --> 00:37:59,958
I'm...

186
00:38:00,333 --> 00:38:01,375
Sue.

187
00:38:05,625 --> 00:38:07,167
<i>I'm Sue.</i>

188
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:10,833
<i>Sue. Sue. Sue...</i>

189
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:21,500
Where is she?

190
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,417
Where is she?

191
00:38:36,583 --> 00:38:38,250
What a gorgeous

192
00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:40,000
little

193
00:38:40,167 --> 00:38:41,292
angel!

194
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:52,625
You're hired.

195
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:54,500
We want a show

196
00:38:54,875 --> 00:38:57,583
that's just like you.

197
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:58,917
Beautiful and happy.

198
00:38:59,333 --> 00:39:01,208
People want to be happy.

199
00:39:02,625 --> 00:39:04,500
We air in two weeks,
so let's get to work.

200
00:39:04,833 --> 00:39:07,875
I'm gonna let you organize
the rest with my assistant...

201
00:39:11,708 --> 00:39:12,792
Isabella.

202
00:39:14,167 --> 00:39:15,500
Isa, Isa, Isa...

203
00:39:15,625 --> 00:39:16,875
who has time to say that?

204
00:39:17,958 --> 00:39:19,042
We're gonna make you Cindy.

205
00:39:19,208 --> 00:39:20,208
It's shorter.

206
00:39:20,333 --> 00:39:21,667
It's better.

207
00:39:22,375 --> 00:39:25,750
So, I'm gonna let you organize
everything else with Cindy.

208
00:39:27,708 --> 00:39:28,708
Before you go,

209
00:39:28,917 --> 00:39:30,833
I just have to mention a...

210
00:39:31,167 --> 00:39:32,875
small scheduling issue.

211
00:39:33,542 --> 00:39:34,750
I have to be

212
00:39:35,667 --> 00:39:37,417
out of town every other week.

213
00:39:38,917 --> 00:39:40,667
To take care of my mother.

214
00:39:42,042 --> 00:39:43,292
Who's very sick.

215
00:39:51,042 --> 00:39:54,167
I want you for this show.

216
00:39:54,208 --> 00:39:57,458
And we will work around
any mother, brother,

217
00:39:57,667 --> 00:39:59,167
fucking sick puppy

218
00:39:59,292 --> 00:40:01,042
you need to take care of.

219
00:40:06,667 --> 00:40:09,000
Gorgeous, with a pure heart.

220
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,708
People are gonna love that.

221
00:40:41,125 --> 00:40:42,125
Perfect.

222
00:41:08,542 --> 00:41:09,792
So you jump out.

223
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:11,958
Touch your elbows.

224
00:41:12,458 --> 00:41:13,500
Head

225
00:41:13,542 --> 00:41:14,542
down.

226
00:41:14,917 --> 00:41:16,000
Contract.

227
00:41:19,292 --> 00:41:21,333
And five, six, seven, eight.

228
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,583
Elbows.

229
00:44:50,583 --> 00:44:52,333
There she is!

230
00:44:57,292 --> 00:44:59,417
Where have you been?

231
00:44:59,875 --> 00:45:03,083
We've all been wanting to have
a drink with you for your departure.

232
00:45:03,833 --> 00:45:05,000
Anyway...

233
00:45:05,292 --> 00:45:07,833
we all chipped in,

234
00:45:09,542 --> 00:45:11,208
and we got you just a little something.

235
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:13,208
To keep you busy.

236
00:45:13,792 --> 00:45:14,833
It's French.

237
00:45:14,958 --> 00:45:17,833
My wife, she swears by it.
Oh, I love my wife.

238
00:45:19,875 --> 00:45:21,000
Oops, I gotta run.

239
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:25,375
But it's always great to see you.

240
00:46:06,083 --> 00:46:07,125
<i>And we're ba--</i>

254
00:47:51,333 --> 00:47:53,833
<i>I cannot believe the incredible price.</i>

255
00:47:53,958 --> 00:47:56,208
<i>For $49.98, shoppers.</i>

256
00:47:56,792 --> 00:47:59,208
<i>Look at the quality of this thing.
This thing is sturdy.</i>

257
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:00,583
<i>Beautiful.</i>

258
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,042
<i>Listen to your music at home, shoppers.</i>

259
00:48:03,125 --> 00:48:05,458
<i>$49.98, I'll take one myself.</i>

260
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:06,583
<i>Put it right there,</i>

261
00:48:06,667 --> 00:48:08,500
<i>hold that one for me,
that one's mine.</i>

262
00:48:08,542 --> 00:48:09,792
<i>How can you ever--</i>

263
00:49:39,708 --> 00:49:43,292
<i>God damn it, lady, come on!
I haven't slept in three nights!</i>

264
00:49:44,042 --> 00:49:46,167
<i>Open up! God damn it!</i>

265
00:49:46,625 --> 00:49:47,625
Are you gonna open--

266
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:52,500
Sorry.

267
00:49:53,375 --> 00:49:54,667
I thought that Ms. Sparkle...

268
00:49:54,833 --> 00:49:57,167
She moved out.
I'm the new tenant.

269
00:49:58,542 --> 00:49:59,542
Sue.

270
00:50:01,167 --> 00:50:02,375
Oler--

271
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:03,542
Oler--

272
00:50:04,333 --> 00:50:05,333
Oliker.

273
00:50:05,375 --> 00:50:07,625
You wanted to complain
about something...

274
00:50:08,667 --> 00:50:09,708
Oliver?

275
00:50:10,583 --> 00:50:11,708
What?

276
00:50:11,875 --> 00:50:12,958
No.

277
00:50:13,708 --> 00:50:14,875
No, no, no...

278
00:50:15,458 --> 00:50:18,667
I think it's awesome when there's stuff
going on in the building.

279
00:50:18,708 --> 00:50:20,458
You know what I mean?

280
00:50:23,292 --> 00:50:24,750
I'm actually...

281
00:50:25,167 --> 00:50:26,417
quite handy.

282
00:50:26,583 --> 00:50:27,875
If you ever need...

283
00:50:29,125 --> 00:50:31,833
need me to be of aid in any way.

284
00:50:32,125 --> 00:50:34,208
I got a sack of tools, and...

285
00:50:35,292 --> 00:50:37,000
I got a big hammer.

286
00:50:39,417 --> 00:50:40,917
You know what I mean.

287
00:50:42,708 --> 00:50:45,208
Anyways, I live right here.

288
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,042
So you know where to find me.

289
00:50:47,208 --> 00:50:48,458
Anytime.

290
00:50:49,083 --> 00:50:50,375
Day or night.

291
00:50:50,792 --> 00:50:51,833
Later.

292
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,250
Hi everybody.

293
00:52:48,417 --> 00:52:49,792
I'm Sue.

294
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:51,042
And it's time

295
00:52:51,208 --> 00:52:52,208
to pump it up!

296
00:52:52,458 --> 00:52:54,083
Are you ready?
Let's go.

297
00:54:23,542 --> 00:54:25,833
Thank you so much, everybody.

298
00:54:26,292 --> 00:54:27,333
I'll see you next week.

299
00:54:28,792 --> 00:54:29,875
Oh...

300
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:32,917
And in the meantime...

301
00:54:33,875 --> 00:54:35,750
take care of yourself.

302
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,083
Where is she?

303
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:46,250
There she is!

304
00:54:47,667 --> 00:54:49,625
Wonderful, wonderful.

305
00:54:50,125 --> 00:54:52,375
That's what I'm talking about!

306
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:11,542
I won't be out late,
so just wait for me.

307
00:56:17,667 --> 00:56:19,208
Don't eat too fast.

308
00:56:35,958 --> 00:56:37,333
Let's go!

309
00:58:31,833 --> 00:58:33,000
Are you alright?

310
00:58:37,292 --> 00:58:38,917
Yes, I'll be right back.

311
00:59:15,375 --> 00:59:16,375
Are you alright?

312
01:00:02,417 --> 01:00:03,708
What did you do?

313
01:00:03,792 --> 01:00:06,167
You seem
even more beautiful than before.

314
01:02:40,375 --> 01:02:41,458
<i>Yes?</i>

315
01:02:41,750 --> 01:02:43,125
Yes, hi.

316
01:02:43,625 --> 01:02:45,958
This is Elisabeth Sparkle.

317
01:02:51,625 --> 01:02:53,292
I'm 503.

318
01:02:54,042 --> 01:02:55,125
<i>Yes.</i>

319
01:02:56,042 --> 01:02:57,083
Yes, hi.

320
01:02:58,292 --> 01:02:59,958
There's been a slight

321
01:03:00,125 --> 01:03:02,000
misuse of the Substance.

322
01:03:02,750 --> 01:03:07,125
A few extra hours were accidentally

323
01:03:07,583 --> 01:03:08,667
used.

324
01:03:08,958 --> 01:03:10,333
Causing um...

325
01:03:11,833 --> 01:03:13,333
an alteration.

326
01:03:14,458 --> 01:03:16,917
So I'm just looking for
the procedure to reverse it.

327
01:03:17,083 --> 01:03:21,000
<i>What has been used on one side
is lost on the other side.</i>

328
01:03:21,167 --> 01:03:23,042
<i>There's no going back.</i>

329
01:03:28,708 --> 01:03:29,750
No...

330
01:03:30,583 --> 01:03:32,542
I don't know what she was thinking.

331
01:03:32,792 --> 01:03:35,042
And obviously she was drunk.

332
01:03:35,292 --> 01:03:37,792
<i>Remember,
there is no "she" and "you".</i>

333
01:03:37,958 --> 01:03:39,292
<i>You are one.</i>

334
01:03:39,458 --> 01:03:40,625
<i>Respect the balance.</i>

335
01:03:40,792 --> 01:03:43,292
<i>And you won't have
any more inconveniences.</i>

336
01:05:21,458 --> 01:05:22,708
Sue!

337
01:05:23,333 --> 01:05:24,417
Sue?

338
01:05:25,167 --> 01:05:27,042
I just saw you on TV.

339
01:05:27,375 --> 01:05:29,125
Holy moly!

340
01:05:30,417 --> 01:05:32,417
Makes me wanna join your class.

341
01:05:32,792 --> 01:05:34,792
You don't give private lessons,
do you?

342
01:05:37,208 --> 01:05:38,250
Hey, um...

343
01:05:39,458 --> 01:05:42,083
What about a drink
at my place tonight?

344
01:05:44,208 --> 01:05:46,000
Come on, don't be shy.

345
01:05:46,250 --> 01:05:48,958
I see you standing behind
the door there, gorgeous.

346
01:05:52,250 --> 01:05:53,333
Alright.

347
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:54,833
Take your time.

348
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,333
But it's a date.

349
01:05:57,250 --> 01:05:58,667
<i>You know, pump it up</i>

350
01:05:58,875 --> 01:06:00,833
<i>You've got to pump it up</i>

351
01:06:01,167 --> 01:06:02,833
<i>You know, pump it up</i>

352
01:06:03,167 --> 01:06:05,042
<i>You've got to pump it up</i>

353
01:07:29,167 --> 01:07:30,333
What can I get you?

354
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:35,750
Mocha latte.

355
01:07:44,250 --> 01:07:46,667
It's long, isn't it?

356
01:07:48,417 --> 01:07:49,708
Excuse me?

357
01:07:53,458 --> 01:07:55,417
Seven days.

358
01:08:25,208 --> 01:08:27,458
Did you follow me here?

359
01:08:28,458 --> 01:08:30,000
I was just curious

360
01:08:30,375 --> 01:08:32,625
to find out how things
were going for you.

361
01:08:33,917 --> 01:08:36,625
Each time, you feel a little more...

362
01:08:37,250 --> 01:08:38,292
lonely.

363
01:08:39,292 --> 01:08:40,333
Don't you think?

364
01:08:41,917 --> 01:08:44,000
I don't know
what you're talking about.

365
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:46,917
I'm fine.

366
01:08:48,083 --> 01:08:49,667
Everything's fine.

367
01:08:49,875 --> 01:08:51,792
It gets harder each time

368
01:08:52,542 --> 01:08:54,208
to remember that you

369
01:08:54,708 --> 01:08:55,958
still deserve

370
01:08:56,208 --> 01:08:57,667
to exist!

371
01:09:00,250 --> 01:09:02,333
That this part of yourself

372
01:09:02,708 --> 01:09:04,958
is still worth something,

373
01:09:05,083 --> 01:09:06,625
that you

374
01:09:07,250 --> 01:09:09,458
still matter!

375
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,083
Has she started yet?

376
01:09:17,417 --> 01:09:20,125
Eating away at you?

377
01:09:37,292 --> 01:09:38,333
Fuck!

378
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:39,750
Watch out!

379
01:09:48,333 --> 01:09:49,375
What?

380
01:10:00,042 --> 01:10:01,083
Hey!

381
01:10:01,250 --> 01:10:02,250
Move!

382
01:10:33,083 --> 01:10:36,458
You're still the most beautiful girl
in the whole wide world.

383
01:10:46,167 --> 01:10:47,292
<i>Hello?</i>

384
01:10:47,333 --> 01:10:49,042
Hi, Fred.

385
01:10:49,208 --> 01:10:50,458
It's Lizzie.

386
01:10:53,625 --> 01:10:54,708
Hello?

387
01:10:55,208 --> 01:10:57,083
<i>Sorry, I'm in shock.</i>

388
01:10:58,208 --> 01:11:00,292
<i>Wow, wow, wow!</i>

389
01:11:00,583 --> 01:11:03,333
<i>I thought I'd never
hear from you again after...</i>

390
01:11:03,375 --> 01:11:04,875
Oh gosh, no, not at all.

391
01:11:05,042 --> 01:11:06,500
I've just, I've just...

392
01:11:06,667 --> 01:11:08,708
I've just been really busy lately.

393
01:11:09,042 --> 01:11:10,208
So listen,

394
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:12,792
I was thinking that...

395
01:11:14,583 --> 01:11:18,000
maybe we could get together
and grab a drink?

396
01:11:23,333 --> 01:11:24,625
Are you still there?

397
01:11:25,167 --> 01:11:27,958
<i>Sorry, I'm in shock again.</i>

398
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:33,250
<i>I could book Luigi's at 8?</i>

399
01:11:33,917 --> 01:11:36,083
Eight at Luigi's it is.

400
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:37,667
I...

401
01:11:37,958 --> 01:11:39,958
I will see you tonight.

402
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,875
<i>- Bye.
- Okay. Bye.</i>

403
01:16:37,125 --> 01:16:39,750
<i>And we're back!
And welcome back to...</i>

404
01:16:40,042 --> 01:16:41,917
<i>Bob and Judy, are you ready?</i>

405
01:16:47,750 --> 01:16:49,167
Hi everybody!

406
01:16:50,250 --> 01:16:52,667
Okay, here we go everyone,
clear the set, please.

407
01:16:52,833 --> 01:16:54,500
First positions, thank you.

408
01:16:54,542 --> 01:16:55,833
Roll cameras.

409
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,125
And in

410
01:16:57,292 --> 01:16:58,500
Three, two...

411
01:16:59,208 --> 01:17:00,208
one...

412
01:17:02,875 --> 01:17:05,208
And squat, squat, squat.

413
01:17:06,792 --> 01:17:08,208
Circle those hips.

414
01:17:08,792 --> 01:17:10,000
Circle those hips.

415
01:17:10,542 --> 01:17:12,917
Contract, contract, contract.

416
01:17:13,333 --> 01:17:16,042
Contract, contract, contract.

417
01:17:16,208 --> 01:17:18,000
Head between your legs!

418
01:17:24,042 --> 01:17:25,167
Cut!

419
01:17:28,917 --> 01:17:30,167
I'm sorry, I thought I...

420
01:17:31,542 --> 01:17:33,417
I thought I...

421
01:17:34,333 --> 01:17:36,000
I just got distracted.

422
01:17:36,583 --> 01:17:38,208
Not a problem, let's get right back to it.

423
01:17:38,750 --> 01:17:40,000
Back to one, please.

424
01:17:42,917 --> 01:17:44,542
Sorry, it's the control room now.

425
01:17:44,667 --> 01:17:47,000
The director said he saw
something bizarre on the monitor.

426
01:17:47,167 --> 01:17:48,792
Bring up the replay on camera 2.

427
01:17:48,958 --> 01:17:50,083
Camera 2!

428
01:18:01,083 --> 01:18:02,167
Forward.

429
01:18:08,167 --> 01:18:09,292
Can I have my dressing gown?

430
01:18:09,625 --> 01:18:12,125
- Sorry, it's in your dressing room.
- Well then, go and get it!

431
01:18:12,708 --> 01:18:14,208
Let's just take this frame by frame.

432
01:18:28,708 --> 01:18:29,750
I need five minutes.

433
01:20:28,833 --> 01:20:30,958
<i>- Yes?
- This balance is not working!</i>

434
01:20:31,250 --> 01:20:33,375
I barely have any time
to enjoy myself.

435
01:20:33,458 --> 01:20:36,333
While she wastes seven days,

436
01:20:36,375 --> 01:20:38,167
stuffing her face in front of the TV!

437
01:20:38,208 --> 01:20:40,250
<i>Remember,
there is no "she" and "you".</i>

438
01:20:40,375 --> 01:20:41,417
<i>You are--</i>

439
01:20:43,250 --> 01:20:45,708
Hello everybody...

440
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:52,000
What's happening?
Where is everybody?

441
01:20:52,125 --> 01:20:53,667
The taping's been cancelled.

442
01:20:54,708 --> 01:20:55,708
What? Why?

443
01:20:55,875 --> 01:20:56,875
Sue.

444
01:20:57,333 --> 01:20:59,583
Harvey wants to see you
in his office immediately.

445
01:21:00,417 --> 01:21:01,458
Okay.

446
01:21:01,708 --> 01:21:02,750
I'll go change...

447
01:21:02,833 --> 01:21:04,375
No, he said "Now".

448
01:21:21,833 --> 01:21:23,625
I'll get right to the point.

449
01:21:24,625 --> 01:21:26,750
We can't keep you
on the morning show.

450
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,208
But why? I just started.

451
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,208
Ratings are through the roof.

452
01:21:34,042 --> 01:21:36,167
We started at 42.

453
01:21:36,667 --> 01:21:38,000
Now we're up to, like...

454
01:21:38,917 --> 01:21:40,000
216.

455
01:21:40,167 --> 01:21:42,458
It's phenomenal!

456
01:21:43,708 --> 01:21:45,083
People love you!

457
01:21:45,625 --> 01:21:47,292
They adore you!

458
01:21:47,417 --> 01:21:49,042
They want more and more

459
01:21:49,208 --> 01:21:50,500
and more of you.

460
01:21:50,667 --> 01:21:52,417
That is why we have decided

461
01:21:53,208 --> 01:21:55,333
that we want you to host

462
01:21:56,292 --> 01:21:58,292
the New Year's Eve show.

463
01:21:58,917 --> 01:22:00,292
You mean the...

464
01:22:00,333 --> 01:22:03,417
The network's biggest show.
50 million viewers.

465
01:22:03,583 --> 01:22:04,750
Live.

466
01:22:04,917 --> 01:22:07,083
You can't go higher than that!

467
01:22:09,333 --> 01:22:10,417
Now, it's gonna be intense.

468
01:22:10,708 --> 01:22:13,250
We only have a few months
to pull it off, so...

469
01:22:13,625 --> 01:22:15,542
Are you in?

470
01:22:26,583 --> 01:22:28,583
If you don't open the door
when opportunity knocks

471
01:22:28,625 --> 01:22:30,000
you won't get another chance.

472
01:22:31,625 --> 01:22:33,375
You of all people know this.

473
01:22:46,167 --> 01:22:48,167
Just one more day,
and then I have a whole week off

474
01:22:48,250 --> 01:22:49,583
we can switch.

475
01:23:07,333 --> 01:23:08,792
We're doing the cover of Vogue!

476
01:23:10,333 --> 01:23:11,583
Just one more day, okay?

477
01:23:48,083 --> 01:23:50,250
No...

478
01:24:19,750 --> 01:24:20,750
<i>Yes?</i>

479
01:24:20,875 --> 01:24:22,833
She didn't respect the balance!

480
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:26,125
She's stealing
more and more time from me.

481
01:24:26,292 --> 01:24:30,042
Completely without consideration
to the consequences.

482
01:24:30,208 --> 01:24:31,792
She's a selfish bitch!

483
01:24:31,833 --> 01:24:32,875
<i>Would you like to stop?</i>

484
01:24:35,917 --> 01:24:37,000
Stop?

485
01:24:37,125 --> 01:24:38,458
<i>You are the matrix.</i>

486
01:24:38,792 --> 01:24:42,042
<i>If you are not satisfied,
you can put an end to the experience</i>

487
01:24:42,208 --> 01:24:45,083
<i>and go back to being just you,
on your own.</i>

488
01:24:45,250 --> 01:24:46,292
<i>Would you like to stop?</i>

489
01:24:49,417 --> 01:24:51,875
Will it go back
to the way it was before?

490
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,208
<i>What has been transferred
won't come back.</i>

491
01:24:54,375 --> 01:24:56,708
<i>But you can stop
the experience as of now.</i>

492
01:24:56,875 --> 01:24:58,208
<i>Would you like to stop?</i>

493
01:24:58,375 --> 01:25:01,125
<i>To go back to being just you,
on your own?</i>

494
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,083
No.

495
01:25:07,667 --> 01:25:08,833
No, no, no...

496
01:25:09,125 --> 01:25:10,500
I can't stop.

497
01:25:11,667 --> 01:25:12,667
She...

498
01:25:14,750 --> 01:25:15,750
I...

499
01:25:21,375 --> 01:25:23,458
The balance
just needs to be respected.

500
01:25:23,625 --> 01:25:24,958
<i>So respect it.</i>

501
01:25:27,958 --> 01:25:29,250
Just stop it. Stop it.

502
01:25:29,583 --> 01:25:31,375
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

503
01:25:40,375 --> 01:25:42,875
<i>Bob, you are the winner!</i>

504
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,833
<i>So Bob, congratulations,
you've won $25,000.</i>

505
01:25:46,208 --> 01:25:49,250
<i>Now you have one final chance
to answer a single question</i>

506
01:25:49,583 --> 01:25:53,833
<i>in our big question round
and play for $250,000!</i>

507
01:25:57,333 --> 01:25:59,083
<i>Now, you'll have just 45 seconds...</i>

508
01:26:58,458 --> 01:27:00,750
Just a little something
to keep you busy.

509
01:27:13,542 --> 01:27:14,958
Fuck...

510
01:27:41,458 --> 01:27:43,833
<i>Yes, ladies and gentlemen,
she is here.</i>

511
01:27:44,292 --> 01:27:45,500
<i>The superstar</i>

512
01:27:45,667 --> 01:27:47,833
<i>of the moment, Sue!</i>

513
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,917
<i>Are you ready? Let's welcome her!</i>

514
01:27:50,083 --> 01:27:51,250
<i>Sue!</i>

515
01:27:53,042 --> 01:27:58,000
You popped up out of nowhere
on our screens like a tornado!

516
01:27:58,167 --> 01:27:59,875
I don't think anybody

517
01:28:00,042 --> 01:28:01,625
was really prepared for this whirlwind.

518
01:28:08,958 --> 01:28:12,208
It all started with the morning show.

519
01:28:12,250 --> 01:28:13,625
And rumor has it,

520
01:28:13,792 --> 01:28:17,208
that you are up
for Tom Grant's next movie.

521
01:28:19,125 --> 01:28:20,250
<i>Ah, wait...</i>

522
01:28:20,458 --> 01:28:21,542
just a moment.

523
01:28:21,708 --> 01:28:23,875
I'm being told
you are going to host

524
01:28:24,042 --> 01:28:26,667
the New Year's Eve show,
can you confirm this?

525
01:28:27,250 --> 01:28:28,250
Yes, that's right.

526
01:28:28,542 --> 01:28:29,875
Yes, that's right.

527
01:28:32,583 --> 01:28:35,458
Oh my God! That is huge news!

528
01:28:38,333 --> 01:28:39,833
<i>Tell us a little bit about yourself.</i>

529
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,458
Where are you from,
how did you get discovered?

530
01:28:42,583 --> 01:28:45,875
I want, we want to know everything.

531
01:28:48,708 --> 01:28:50,083
Well, I mean..

532
01:28:50,667 --> 01:28:53,000
there's really not very much to tell.

533
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:54,833
I'm just a girl

534
01:28:54,875 --> 01:28:58,583
from a very small town in Indiana.

535
01:28:58,792 --> 01:29:00,542
I'm sure that you've never heard of it.

536
01:29:00,792 --> 01:29:02,750
In fact, it's not even a town.

537
01:29:02,792 --> 01:29:05,875
I'm not sure you could
really even call it a village. It's...

538
01:29:06,750 --> 01:29:08,625
a farm, perhaps?

539
01:29:15,375 --> 01:29:17,000
<i>But, ever since I can remember,</i>

540
01:29:17,167 --> 01:29:18,875
it has always been my dream

541
01:29:19,042 --> 01:29:20,250
<i>to be on the screen.</i>

542
01:29:20,833 --> 01:29:22,958
This is my dream.

543
01:29:23,125 --> 01:29:25,042
As a child I used to put
on shows for my family.

544
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:27,333
Your family.

545
01:29:27,500 --> 01:29:28,583
How sweet.

546
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:32,542
<i>So...</i>

547
01:29:32,833 --> 01:29:35,083
everyone is aware

548
01:29:35,250 --> 01:29:36,708
that you replaced

549
01:29:37,083 --> 01:29:38,417
Elisabeth Sparkle.

550
01:29:39,583 --> 01:29:42,708
And no doubt about it, you stepped in,

551
01:29:42,750 --> 01:29:44,375
you turned up the volume,

552
01:29:44,417 --> 01:29:46,583
and you rocked their world.

553
01:29:46,875 --> 01:29:48,500
Were you a fan of her show?

554
01:29:54,958 --> 01:29:56,125
Well...

555
01:29:57,375 --> 01:29:59,083
Well, I can't...

556
01:29:59,458 --> 01:30:02,125
I can't really say
that I actually watched

557
01:30:02,292 --> 01:30:03,292
<i>her show.</i>

558
01:30:03,917 --> 01:30:07,458
You do know that we're not exactly
from the same generation.

559
01:30:08,458 --> 01:30:10,000
And you have to admit

560
01:30:10,167 --> 01:30:11,500
it was a bit old-fashioned.

561
01:30:14,542 --> 01:30:15,958
Jurassic Fitness, really.

562
01:30:16,875 --> 01:30:18,333
Jurassic Fitness?

563
01:30:18,500 --> 01:30:19,667
It needed a change.

564
01:30:21,958 --> 01:30:23,333
I'll fucking show you.

565
01:30:24,625 --> 01:30:26,583
You wanna see some Jurassic Fitness?

566
01:30:29,875 --> 01:30:31,000
<i>You want it?</i>

567
01:30:31,917 --> 01:30:32,917
Come on,

568
01:30:33,042 --> 01:30:35,500
come get
your fucking Jurassic Fitness!

569
01:30:44,292 --> 01:30:46,458
But my mother was a huge fan of hers.

570
01:30:48,667 --> 01:30:50,500
So every morning,

571
01:30:51,042 --> 01:30:52,042
rain or shine,

572
01:30:53,292 --> 01:30:55,250
<i>Sparkle Your Life was on TV.</i>

573
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:57,500
So, in a way, I grew up with her.

574
01:30:57,792 --> 01:30:59,375
Whether I liked it or not.

575
01:31:00,583 --> 01:31:03,292
I guess that's why you can say
we have some sort of connection.

576
01:31:03,542 --> 01:31:05,167
"Some sort of connection."

577
01:31:05,333 --> 01:31:06,542
You wouldn't exist

578
01:31:06,792 --> 01:31:07,875
without me.

579
01:31:19,292 --> 01:31:21,167
It is time, ladies and gentlemen,

580
01:31:21,208 --> 01:31:23,583
for our final question.

581
01:31:23,750 --> 01:31:25,542
The question that we ask

582
01:31:25,583 --> 01:31:29,708
each and every one of our guests.

583
01:31:30,333 --> 01:31:33,667
Would you share one of your little

584
01:31:33,708 --> 01:31:35,042
beauty secrets with us?

585
01:31:36,833 --> 01:31:38,542
Just one little trick of yours

586
01:31:38,708 --> 01:31:42,125
that helps you look so incredibly
stunning, I mean, look at you.

587
01:31:42,167 --> 01:31:43,875
- I don't know...
- Say it!

588
01:31:44,875 --> 01:31:46,250
Say it!

589
01:31:47,292 --> 01:31:48,833
- Let me think.
- Say it.

590
01:31:48,958 --> 01:31:51,250
Tell them
who your little beauty secret is.

591
01:31:51,417 --> 01:31:52,333
I guess...

592
01:31:52,458 --> 01:31:54,625
Why don't we just show them right here?

593
01:31:54,792 --> 01:31:56,292
Here's your little beauty secret.

594
01:31:56,417 --> 01:31:58,083
<i>I guess I just try to be myself.</i>

595
01:31:58,250 --> 01:31:59,250
<i>To be sincere</i>

596
01:31:59,417 --> 01:32:01,542
<i>and grateful for all that I have.</i>

597
01:32:02,292 --> 01:32:04,208
<i>And to always remember
to lead with my heart.</i>

598
01:32:05,042 --> 01:32:07,083
<i>America's sweetheart.</i>

599
01:32:16,958 --> 01:32:18,583
"I just...

600
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:21,042
I try to be myself."

601
01:32:22,625 --> 01:32:23,792
Stop it!

602
01:32:24,875 --> 01:32:26,333
Stop it.

603
01:32:26,542 --> 01:32:28,250
You're taking it from me.

604
01:32:28,417 --> 01:32:30,583
That's your little secret.

605
01:32:30,750 --> 01:32:32,292
Stop it!

606
01:32:32,583 --> 01:32:35,292
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

607
01:32:46,750 --> 01:32:48,208
You have to...

608
01:32:48,375 --> 01:32:51,458
...control yourself!

609
01:33:11,125 --> 01:33:12,958
I can't go back inside her.

610
01:33:21,083 --> 01:33:22,542
Gross, old,

611
01:33:22,667 --> 01:33:23,917
fat,

612
01:33:24,708 --> 01:33:25,750
disgusting!

613
01:34:46,292 --> 01:34:47,667
Coming to bed?

614
01:34:48,375 --> 01:34:49,375
Yes.

615
01:34:50,167 --> 01:34:51,458
I'll be right there.

616
01:35:56,500 --> 01:35:57,833
<i>- Yes?
- Hi!</i>

617
01:35:57,875 --> 01:35:59,667
Hi, this is an emergency.

618
01:35:59,833 --> 01:36:01,750
There's no more stabilizer fluid.

619
01:36:03,875 --> 01:36:05,042
Hello?

620
01:36:06,292 --> 01:36:07,875
It's fucking 503.

621
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:09,042
Yes.

622
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,625
I'm telling you, this is urgent.
There's no more stabilizer fluid.

623
01:36:12,792 --> 01:36:14,667
<i>It means you've reached the end.</i>

624
01:36:17,083 --> 01:36:18,250
What do you mean, the end?

625
01:36:18,542 --> 01:36:19,917
<i>You've drained it all out.</i>

626
01:36:20,083 --> 01:36:21,125
<i>If you want more,</i>

627
01:36:21,167 --> 01:36:23,042
<i>you must let the fluid regenerate.</i>

628
01:36:23,833 --> 01:36:25,208
Tell me how to do it,

629
01:36:25,250 --> 01:36:27,500
I need to stabilize myself right now.

630
01:36:27,875 --> 01:36:29,500
<i>You simply have to switch.</i>

631
01:36:32,208 --> 01:36:33,500
Excuse me?

632
01:36:33,542 --> 01:36:36,208
<i>The switch reboots
the fluid secretion process</i>

633
01:36:36,375 --> 01:36:38,833
<i>so you can continue
to enjoy the experience.</i>

634
01:36:38,875 --> 01:36:40,833
No, no, no.

635
01:36:41,125 --> 01:36:42,542
I can't switch, I can't.

636
01:36:43,083 --> 01:36:44,625
Especially not now.

637
01:36:44,750 --> 01:36:46,542
<i>There is no other option.</i>

638
01:37:13,167 --> 01:37:14,292
Sue?

639
01:37:26,542 --> 01:37:27,708
Babe?

640
01:37:30,792 --> 01:37:31,833
Sue?

641
01:37:32,375 --> 01:37:33,500
You alright?

642
01:37:39,375 --> 01:37:40,708
Stressed out about tomorrow?

643
01:38:01,167 --> 01:38:03,167
Sue? Is something wrong?

644
01:38:08,167 --> 01:38:10,542
You a little cranky because
of your lady business?

645
01:38:15,292 --> 01:38:16,333
Sue, open the door.

646
01:38:17,583 --> 01:38:18,833
Come on, Sue.

647
01:38:19,417 --> 01:38:21,292
It's not funny,
I need to take a piss.

648
01:38:22,542 --> 01:38:23,875
Sue, open the door.

649
01:38:24,792 --> 01:38:26,500
Open the door, Sue. Come on.

650
01:38:27,917 --> 01:38:29,167
Babe.

651
01:38:32,083 --> 01:38:33,375
Open the door.

652
01:38:45,250 --> 01:38:46,333
Sue...

653
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,333
Open the door!

654
01:38:56,250 --> 01:38:57,542
Get out!

655
01:38:58,167 --> 01:38:59,500
What the fuck?

656
01:39:00,458 --> 01:39:02,333
Get the fuck out!

657
01:39:02,667 --> 01:39:04,792
Who's this? Who the fuck is this?

658
01:39:04,917 --> 01:39:06,208
And leave me alone!

659
01:39:15,125 --> 01:39:16,958
What the fuck!

660
01:40:10,250 --> 01:40:11,292
<i>Yes?</i>

661
01:40:12,042 --> 01:40:13,083
I...

662
01:40:14,083 --> 01:40:16,000
It's 503,

663
01:40:17,125 --> 01:40:18,792
and I want to stop.

664
01:40:18,958 --> 01:40:22,250
<i>Are you sure?
Once you stop, you can't go back.</i>

665
01:40:22,417 --> 01:40:24,000
I wanna stop!

666
01:40:24,167 --> 01:40:26,375
I wanna fucking stop.

667
01:40:26,750 --> 01:40:28,583
I wanna stop!

668
01:40:29,125 --> 01:40:30,250
<i>We'll deliver.</i>

669
01:41:17,250 --> 01:41:18,292
Sue? I--

670
01:41:18,375 --> 01:41:19,500
Fuck off!

671
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:41,083
<i>Are you sure?</i>

672
01:42:43,542 --> 01:42:46,000
<i>Once you stop, you can't go back.</i>

673
01:42:46,333 --> 01:42:48,958
<i>You will simply remain on your own.</i>

674
01:42:49,667 --> 01:42:52,000
<i>Just on your own.</i>

675
01:42:53,750 --> 01:42:55,917
<i>Just on your own.</i>

676
01:42:55,958 --> 01:42:57,125
<i>On your own...</i>

677
01:42:57,167 --> 01:42:58,167
Shut the fuck up!

678
01:42:58,417 --> 01:42:59,792
<i>On your--</i>

679
01:43:48,292 --> 01:43:49,625
<i>Elisabeth!</i>

680
01:43:49,667 --> 01:43:50,833
<i>We love you!</i>

681
01:43:53,250 --> 01:43:54,667
<i>Over here!</i>

682
01:43:54,708 --> 01:43:56,375
<i>We love you!</i>

683
01:44:01,125 --> 01:44:02,417
I can't.

684
01:44:03,792 --> 01:44:04,833
I can't.

685
01:44:05,375 --> 01:44:07,167
I can't do this.

686
01:44:10,167 --> 01:44:11,667
I need you.

687
01:44:12,249 --> 01:44:13,417
Cause...

688
01:44:13,583 --> 01:44:15,417
I hate myself.

689
01:44:18,250 --> 01:44:20,042
You gotta...

690
01:44:20,292 --> 01:44:21,667
you gotta get ready,

691
01:44:21,833 --> 01:44:23,333
it's our big,
it's our big night.

692
01:44:25,292 --> 01:44:27,708
Come on, they're gonna
love you so much.

693
01:44:28,917 --> 01:44:29,958
Come on.

694
01:44:31,167 --> 01:44:32,167
Come on.

695
01:44:32,292 --> 01:44:33,458
One, two...

696
01:44:33,958 --> 01:44:35,208
you're the only lovable part of me,

697
01:44:35,250 --> 01:44:36,958
you have to come back.

698
01:44:37,125 --> 01:44:38,208
You have to come back!

699
01:44:38,542 --> 01:44:39,583
Come back...

700
01:45:03,292 --> 01:45:04,292
Come on.

701
01:45:06,083 --> 01:45:07,125
Come on.

702
01:45:13,667 --> 01:45:14,667
Come on!

703
01:51:17,375 --> 01:51:19,333
Got an hour and a half
for makeup. Hair...

704
01:51:19,458 --> 01:51:21,208
And then we gotta get you
to the fitting room, into your dress.

705
01:51:21,292 --> 01:51:24,042
After that we have one final test
on stage for lighting and sound.

706
01:51:24,083 --> 01:51:25,542
We have a bit of downtime
before the show starts.

707
01:51:25,583 --> 01:51:26,792
You got it?

708
01:51:26,958 --> 01:51:28,000
Okay, let's go.

709
01:51:28,125 --> 01:51:29,125
Come on.

710
01:51:35,917 --> 01:51:36,958
The dress.

711
01:51:37,583 --> 01:51:38,958
Wonderful!

712
01:51:39,458 --> 01:51:40,500
Perfect!

713
01:51:48,458 --> 01:51:49,958
And here you go...

714
01:51:57,708 --> 01:51:58,708
Good.

715
01:51:59,208 --> 01:52:00,333
Can we get the dance light?

716
01:52:05,500 --> 01:52:07,333
I'm gonna be right back, sorry.

717
01:53:33,417 --> 01:53:36,417
Sue. They need to see you on stage
to set the lights.

718
01:53:38,500 --> 01:53:39,583
Huh?

719
01:54:00,417 --> 01:54:01,917
<i>Have you ever dreamt</i>

720
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,375
<i>of a better version of yourself?</i>

721
01:54:06,458 --> 01:54:07,667
<i>More beautiful,</i>

722
01:54:08,125 --> 01:54:09,542
<i>more perfect...</i>

723
01:54:09,708 --> 01:54:10,708
Sue?

724
01:54:12,542 --> 01:54:14,125
Yes, let me meet you there.

725
01:54:14,292 --> 01:54:16,167
Okay, so I'll wait for you on stage.

726
01:54:32,917 --> 01:54:33,958
Sue.

727
01:54:37,333 --> 01:54:39,750
Let me introduce you
to the shareholders.

728
01:54:39,833 --> 01:54:43,042
They have been dying to meet you.

729
01:54:46,500 --> 01:54:47,875
Is everything...

730
01:54:49,125 --> 01:54:50,458
okay?

731
01:54:55,167 --> 01:54:56,417
So, smile!

732
01:55:04,375 --> 01:55:06,542
It's what we want tonight!

733
01:55:07,500 --> 01:55:11,083
Pretty girls should always smile.

734
01:55:13,125 --> 01:55:14,167
Girls, come on.

735
01:55:14,375 --> 01:55:15,750
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

736
01:55:17,792 --> 01:55:19,042
Come on, we gotta go.

737
01:55:21,542 --> 01:55:23,625
Tiffany, Cindy, Ashley.

738
01:55:23,792 --> 01:55:25,042
Go, go, go!

739
01:55:25,208 --> 01:55:27,500
Feathers! Feathers! Feathers!

740
01:56:19,333 --> 01:56:20,750
Hey, ready for tonight?

741
01:57:10,583 --> 01:57:12,375
I need a better version of myself.

742
01:57:12,542 --> 01:57:15,292
Please give me
a better version of myself, please.

743
01:57:21,167 --> 01:57:22,667
Please!

744
01:57:24,375 --> 01:57:26,125
Come on!

745
01:59:20,333 --> 01:59:24,333
Looks like everything
sure is in the right place this time.

746
01:59:26,167 --> 01:59:27,332
<i>Please say your name,</i>

747
01:59:27,500 --> 01:59:29,000
<i>age, measurements.</i>

748
01:59:32,333 --> 01:59:33,625
I'm...

749
01:59:39,792 --> 01:59:41,167
I'm...

750
02:02:25,833 --> 02:02:26,917
Pretty girls

751
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,625
should always smile.

752
02:03:04,458 --> 02:03:07,708
At last, we were starting to worry.
Hurry up, you're up in five.

753
02:03:26,417 --> 02:03:28,708
There she is, so beautiful.

754
02:03:29,792 --> 02:03:31,125
We love you!

755
02:03:32,792 --> 02:03:34,333
This is where you belong,

756
02:03:34,375 --> 02:03:35,917
and you'll always belong here.

757
02:03:36,082 --> 02:03:37,375
We can't do it without you.

758
02:03:37,542 --> 02:03:38,958
We could never do it without you.

759
02:03:39,875 --> 02:03:41,542
You're irreplaceable.

760
02:04:09,792 --> 02:04:11,875
Girls, come on, let's go.
What are we waiting for?

761
02:04:12,042 --> 02:04:13,125
Alright, come on, everybody.

762
02:04:13,208 --> 02:04:14,417
Let's go, let's go.

763
02:04:18,167 --> 02:04:20,625
You will not be disappointed.

764
02:04:21,417 --> 02:04:23,333
She's my most beautiful creation.

765
02:04:23,500 --> 02:04:25,917
I have shaped her for success.

766
02:06:18,625 --> 02:06:21,000
I'm so happy

767
02:06:21,083 --> 02:06:23,750
to be with you tonight.

768
02:06:26,625 --> 02:06:29,792
I've missed you all

769
02:06:29,917 --> 02:06:32,417
so much!

770
02:07:32,792 --> 02:07:34,333
The monster!

771
02:07:42,542 --> 02:07:43,958
Shoot the monster!

772
02:07:45,417 --> 02:07:46,417
It's a freak!

773
02:07:46,708 --> 02:07:47,750
No!

774
02:07:47,875 --> 02:07:50,083
Shoot the monster!

775
02:07:50,792 --> 02:07:51,875
Don't be scared

776
02:07:52,042 --> 02:07:53,125
Monster!

777
02:07:53,208 --> 02:07:54,667
It's still me.

778
02:07:54,917 --> 02:07:56,125
It's me!

779
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:58,083
I'm Elisabeth.

780
02:07:58,125 --> 02:07:59,083
I'm Sue!

781
02:08:04,833 --> 02:08:05,875
Freak!

782
02:08:08,167 --> 02:08:10,292
You freak!

783
02:08:13,167 --> 02:08:14,958
Monster!

784
02:08:18,250 --> 02:08:19,375
Freak!

785
02:08:20,958 --> 02:08:22,625
Monster!

786
02:08:26,042 --> 02:08:27,458
It's me!

787
02:08:29,375 --> 02:08:30,958
Just me.

788
02:08:40,250 --> 02:08:41,500
I'm the same.

789
02:09:36,292 --> 02:09:38,792
<i>Too bad her boobs aren't
in the middle of her face</i>

790
02:09:38,833 --> 02:09:40,708
<i>instead of that nose.</i>

791
02:09:43,625 --> 02:09:44,625
<i>Next!</i>

792
02:09:50,707 --> 02:09:54,000
<i>Pretty girls should always smile.</i>

793
02:09:59,292 --> 02:10:01,792
<i>At 50 it stops.</i>

794
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:04,292
So beautiful!

795
02:13:05,208 --> 02:13:06,417
We love you!

796
02:13:09,125 --> 02:13:11,084
You're irreplaceable!
