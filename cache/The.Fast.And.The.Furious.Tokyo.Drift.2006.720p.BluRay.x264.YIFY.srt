1
00:03:08,071 --> 00:03:09,364
Nice ride.

2
00:03:10,574 --> 00:03:11,992
It does the job.

3
00:03:12,326 --> 00:03:14,912
What job, delivering pizzas?

4
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,291
Well, it's not the ride, it's the rider.

5
00:03:23,712 --> 00:03:25,964
- What the hell was that?
- What?

6
00:03:26,465 --> 00:03:28,842
Hey! You talking to my girl?

7
00:03:29,134 --> 00:03:30,969
- Oh, shit. Here we go.
- Yeah.

8
00:03:31,261 --> 00:03:34,306
She was just admiring my ride.

9
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:35,724
"My ride."

10
00:03:35,807 --> 00:03:39,353
My grandma's Buick could smoke
that piece of shit, trailer trash.

11
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:42,064
Well, what about your daddy's Viper?

12
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:46,109
This beast's got 500 horsepower
and a Borla exhaust system.

13
00:03:46,193 --> 00:03:48,570
It does 0 to 60 in like 4.3 seconds...

14
00:03:48,654 --> 00:03:50,364
- That's about right. That's about right.
- Yeah.

15
00:03:50,447 --> 00:03:52,783
Wow. You can read the brochure.

16
00:04:15,973 --> 00:04:18,809
What a pitch, baby. What a pitch.
I like that.

17
00:04:18,976 --> 00:04:21,103
What's he gonna do?

18
00:04:21,186 --> 00:04:23,188
- Let's make it happen.
- Bring it.

19
00:04:33,782 --> 00:04:35,367
I got your back.

20
00:04:37,828 --> 00:04:40,789
Why don't you nice boys let your cars do the talking?

21
00:04:42,374 --> 00:04:44,501
I only race for pink slips.

22
00:04:45,502 --> 00:04:47,296
This car goes for 80 grand.

23
00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:50,590
What would I do
with a broken-ass piece of shit like that?

24
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:56,430
How about me?

25
00:04:59,891 --> 00:05:03,562
Winner gets me.

26
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:13,405
Cut it, let's out it. Let's go, go, go, go!

27
00:05:27,544 --> 00:05:30,213
Blast-off, baby!

28
00:05:32,758 --> 00:05:34,801
First one out the other side...

29
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:38,180
- It's time.
- Let's go!

30
00:05:38,263 --> 00:05:40,682
- Ready, boys?
- Make it interesting, Clay.

31
00:06:24,559 --> 00:06:25,644
Shit!

32
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:38,323
Yeah!

33
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,936
I thought you loved me.

34
00:07:58,236 --> 00:07:59,446
Oh, Well.

35
00:08:10,207 --> 00:08:11,708
What the hell?

36
00:08:21,593 --> 00:08:23,887
Guess I got a new date for prom.

37
00:08:33,772 --> 00:08:35,941
- Clay, stop the car!
- Shut up!

38
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:46,952
- Clay, stop the car!
- Shut up!

39
00:08:47,035 --> 00:08:48,286
Stop it!

40
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:54,960
Clay, please stop! Please stop!

41
00:10:06,114 --> 00:10:08,158
Can I get a copy of that?

42
00:10:10,201 --> 00:10:12,454
You think this is a joke, huh?

43
00:10:13,997 --> 00:10:15,707
You see Ken and Barbie over there?

44
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:18,627
They're gonna walk out of here
without even a slap on the wrist.

45
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:21,171
Mommy and Daddy are too hooked up.

46
00:10:23,965 --> 00:10:26,176
But I like screw-ups like you.

47
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:30,639
You know why?
'Cause you're 100% guaranteed conviction.

48
00:10:31,056 --> 00:10:32,891
- Where's my car?
- I crushed it.

49
00:10:32,974 --> 00:10:33,975
You did what?

50
00:10:34,059 --> 00:10:35,143
- Sit down! You're done.
- Easy, easy.

51
00:10:35,226 --> 00:10:36,561
You're done. You understand me?
You're done.

52
00:10:36,645 --> 00:10:38,412
And all before your eighteenth birthday.
Now sit down.

53
00:10:41,733 --> 00:10:42,859
Sean.

54
00:10:44,194 --> 00:10:46,446
What the hell were you thinking, huh?

55
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,407
Mrs. Boswell? Please.

56
00:10:50,617 --> 00:10:51,618
It's, um...

57
00:10:51,743 --> 00:10:53,078
It's Miss.

58
00:10:55,497 --> 00:10:59,751
Officer, is it illegal to smoke in here?

59
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:11,137
It's a tough state.
And it's a pretty clear-cut case.

60
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:15,475
He'll be lucky if they don't try him as an adult.

61
00:11:17,394 --> 00:11:20,355
This is our third town in two years.

62
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:25,610
Your son's got two priors for reckless
driving, willful destruction of property.

63
00:11:25,694 --> 00:11:27,654
This makes it strike three.

64
00:11:27,737 --> 00:11:30,365
They're definitely gonna want to get him off the streets.

65
00:11:30,448 --> 00:11:33,284
Well, there's just got to be another way.

66
00:11:42,085 --> 00:11:44,504
So, where are we moving this time?

67
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:49,175
We are not moving anywhere.

68
00:13:44,415 --> 00:13:45,500
Sean.

69
00:13:46,543 --> 00:13:48,419
I thought you were gonna be here on the 7th.

70
00:13:48,503 --> 00:13:50,129
Today is the 7th.

71
00:13:51,548 --> 00:13:54,092
Well, look, just hold on one second.

72
00:14:20,368 --> 00:14:21,786
Come on in.

73
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:28,167
This is it.

74
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,927
You know, Sean, I was gonna be there.

75
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:41,055
But your mom, she said the 7th, see,

76
00:14:41,139 --> 00:14:43,766
and we're a day ahead of you in Japan.

77
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:48,980
Well, you're here now, and that's good.

78
00:14:50,481 --> 00:14:52,650
So, how is your mom?

79
00:14:54,694 --> 00:14:56,321
Where do I sleep?

80
00:14:57,155 --> 00:14:59,365
Now, Sean, you know she had no other choice.

81
00:14:59,449 --> 00:15:02,160
I mean, it was either this or juvi hall,

82
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:07,415
I mean, you just can't keep moving away
every time you get into trouble.

83
00:15:07,498 --> 00:15:09,042
Worked for you.

84
00:15:12,503 --> 00:15:14,839
Look, neither of us asked for this.

85
00:15:15,465 --> 00:15:18,384
But I promised your mom I'd take care of you.

86
00:15:18,801 --> 00:15:21,846
So you just go by the rules her and I agreed to,

87
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:24,974
- ...and I'm sure you'll manage just fine.
- Rules?

88
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:28,186
Yeah, rules. Real simple.

89
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:31,898
You go to school, you come back here right after.

90
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:36,027
And I don't want to see or hear
about you anywhere near a car.

91
00:15:38,196 --> 00:15:40,323
Here, the bedroom is yours.

92
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,164
Make yourself comfortable.

93
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:52,251
Lights out in 10.

94
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:53,896
You got to be kidding.

95
00:17:51,245 --> 00:17:53,081
- Wrong train.
- Huh?

96
00:17:53,164 --> 00:17:54,665
I'm new here.

97
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:01,464
Boswell, yes, ma'am.

98
00:18:28,449 --> 00:18:29,617
<i>Uwabaki.</i>

99
00:19:02,233 --> 00:19:04,527
Japanese food is like the Army.

100
00:19:05,153 --> 00:19:07,029
Don't ask, don't tell.

101
00:19:08,239 --> 00:19:11,701
Name's Twinkie.
Hey, I noticed you ain't have a laptop.

102
00:19:13,578 --> 00:19:14,745
Yeah?

103
00:19:15,246 --> 00:19:17,456
I'll hook you up. Half price.

104
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:20,001
No, I'm cool.

105
00:19:20,084 --> 00:19:23,379
60% off.
Since we're both army brats and everything.

106
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:26,299
I ain't got no cash, man.

107
00:19:26,382 --> 00:19:28,176
And I ain't an army brat.

108
00:19:28,259 --> 00:19:31,596
All right, all right.
Well, what about a cell phone, huh?

109
00:19:32,263 --> 00:19:34,473
Everybody needs a cell phone.

110
00:19:34,765 --> 00:19:36,100
No offense,

111
00:19:36,434 --> 00:19:40,188
but I'm probably not gonna be here
long enough to remember your name.

112
00:19:40,271 --> 00:19:43,691
Then you gonna need some new shoes to book town with, man.

113
00:19:43,774 --> 00:19:46,861
You like Michael Jordan?
I love Michael Jordan.

114
00:19:48,112 --> 00:19:49,655
Check this out.

115
00:19:49,947 --> 00:19:52,491
Brand new Jordans. Not even out yet.

116
00:19:52,575 --> 00:19:55,786
LeBron James couldn't even get his hands on those.

117
00:19:57,455 --> 00:19:59,999
You selling that Sparco steering wheel?

118
00:20:00,082 --> 00:20:02,501
Hell, no. That's mine right there.

119
00:20:02,793 --> 00:20:05,129
Man, I even paid retail for it.

120
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,173
What you drive?

121
00:20:07,256 --> 00:20:08,716
- My ride?
- Yeah.

122
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,260
- My ride's one of a kind.
- Show me.

123
00:20:12,303 --> 00:20:14,847
Thought you weren't sticking around.

124
00:20:15,598 --> 00:20:16,807
All right.

125
00:21:08,693 --> 00:21:11,779
Slamming, huh? Look at that car.

126
00:21:11,862 --> 00:21:12,863
Ooh!

127
00:21:13,823 --> 00:21:15,700
At least let me drive.

128
00:21:15,866 --> 00:21:18,244
Y'all better have some real cars around here.

129
00:21:18,327 --> 00:21:21,706
Okay, I see
somebody got jokes, huh? Well, all right.

130
00:21:21,956 --> 00:21:24,000
I don't know if you're ready for them, though.

131
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,127
You look a little nervous.

132
00:21:26,669 --> 00:21:28,212
What up, Tosh?

133
00:22:02,747 --> 00:22:05,082
For when you blow your wad, man.

134
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,766
Hear that?

135
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:05,643
It's still not right for the way I drive.

136
00:23:05,726 --> 00:23:08,437
'Cause the way you drive is wrong!
See?

137
00:23:08,521 --> 00:23:10,940
I don't need a computer
to tell me about my throttle response.

138
00:23:11,023 --> 00:23:13,442
Okay. Then we're done here.

139
00:23:16,112 --> 00:23:18,906
You wouldn't have that problem with a V8.

140
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:20,825
Boys.

141
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:24,286
All they care about is who's got the biggest engine.

142
00:23:24,954 --> 00:23:27,164
I'm a guy. It's in my DNA.

143
00:23:28,582 --> 00:23:32,253
So y'all race with these things, huh?
Cute little toys.

144
00:23:33,921 --> 00:23:37,133
You know, I almost didn't recognize you
without your slippers on.

145
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:39,135
<i>Don't you mean uwabaki?</i>

146
00:23:40,344 --> 00:23:41,804
Neela, right?

147
00:23:42,555 --> 00:23:44,473
You're a quick learner.

148
00:23:47,226 --> 00:23:48,936
So, where you from, anyway?

149
00:23:49,019 --> 00:23:50,187
Here.

150
00:23:50,646 --> 00:23:53,983
No, I mean, not where you live.
Where'd you come from?

151
00:23:54,066 --> 00:23:56,360
Does it really matter where I'm from?

152
00:24:03,993 --> 00:24:05,661
Who's the tourist?

153
00:24:08,247 --> 00:24:10,583
What's with you and the schoolgirls, D?

154
00:24:10,666 --> 00:24:13,878
You're moving up in the world.
You gotta elevate your company.

155
00:24:13,961 --> 00:24:17,047
Wednesday, Wednesday, meet Thursday.
God. Girl.

156
00:24:21,427 --> 00:24:24,638
Ladies, hold that thought, all right?
All right, beautiful. Hold up.

157
00:24:27,141 --> 00:24:28,392
He was just leaving.

158
00:24:33,147 --> 00:24:35,566
I'm sorry. I don't speak Japanese.

159
00:24:39,069 --> 00:24:42,031
<i>Understand that'? Gaijin?</i>

160
00:24:42,114 --> 00:24:43,365
Takashi.

161
00:24:43,908 --> 00:24:45,451
We were just talking.

162
00:24:45,534 --> 00:24:47,411
This isn't your scene.

163
00:24:48,245 --> 00:24:52,374
That word you called me, gaijin or something or other,

164
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:55,085
what does that mean exactly?

165
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:58,547
Means, turn around,

166
00:24:59,632 --> 00:25:00,841
keep walking.

167
00:25:00,925 --> 00:25:03,385
That's exactly what we gonna do.
Come on, man, let's roll.

168
00:25:03,469 --> 00:25:04,929
Yo, look, man, he's yakuza.

169
00:25:05,012 --> 00:25:07,973
Now, see, that's funny,

170
00:25:08,057 --> 00:25:11,101
'cause I thought this was, like, a free country

171
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:14,897
where a girl could talk to whoever she wants.

172
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:19,902
You know who I am, boy?

173
00:25:20,236 --> 00:25:24,448
Yeah. You're like
the Justin Timberlake of Japan, right?

174
00:25:30,287 --> 00:25:31,455
Leave.

175
00:25:31,622 --> 00:25:34,750
Damn, man. You know yakuza? The Mafia?

176
00:25:36,961 --> 00:25:40,548
Look, sorry, DK-san.
Monkey didn't have his banana today.

177
00:25:40,673 --> 00:25:42,341
Hey, D, let's go.

178
00:25:42,424 --> 00:25:43,884
It's time to race.

179
00:25:47,972 --> 00:25:49,848
Good luck, Timberlake.

180
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,194
You're the one that's lucky, 'cause I'm about to race.

181
00:26:05,364 --> 00:26:06,991
Then let's race.

182
00:26:09,743 --> 00:26:12,830
With what, huh? Your skateboard?

183
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,835
Easy to sound cocky when you got no ride.

184
00:26:18,502 --> 00:26:19,837
Take mine.

185
00:26:23,966 --> 00:26:25,342
Let's race.

186
00:26:29,346 --> 00:26:31,974
What? I wanna see what the kid's got.

187
00:26:38,689 --> 00:26:40,190
Can he drive?

188
00:26:41,275 --> 00:26:42,735
Can he drive?

189
00:26:44,737 --> 00:26:46,864
You know what DK stands for?

190
00:26:47,865 --> 00:26:49,241
Donkey Kong?

191
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,035
Drift King.

192
00:26:52,703 --> 00:26:53,871
Drift?

193
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:56,790
What do you mean, drift?

194
00:27:09,511 --> 00:27:11,513
Still need a dictionary?

195
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,557
You know that real famous painting?

196
00:27:13,641 --> 00:27:16,018
The one of the woman who's smiling all the time?

197
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:18,312
<i>- The Mona Lisa.
- Right, right, right. Mona Lisa.</i>

198
00:27:18,395 --> 00:27:21,774
<i>Well, look, man, this car right here's
like the Mona Lisa of the drift world.</i>

199
00:27:21,857 --> 00:27:24,568
Han rebuilt this bad boy from ground up.

200
00:27:24,652 --> 00:27:29,156
We talking forged pistons,
bigger turbo, new rods, new crankshaft.

201
00:27:30,199 --> 00:27:33,494
Hey, man, Han's labor ain't cheap, man, you feel me?

202
00:27:34,536 --> 00:27:37,790
Well, if I needed a 30-second lesson
on how to drift...

203
00:27:37,873 --> 00:27:40,542
All right, look, man, there's lots of ways
you can do this, all right?

204
00:27:40,626 --> 00:27:41,710
Hand braking is the easiest,

205
00:27:41,794 --> 00:27:44,171
so the first thing I want you to do,
I want you to rip that e-brake.

206
00:27:44,254 --> 00:27:47,925
All right, after you rip the e-brake,
then I want you to power over.

207
00:27:48,842 --> 00:27:52,012
You know what?
Just don't mess up Mona, all right?

208
00:27:52,096 --> 00:27:53,430
All right.

209
00:28:47,401 --> 00:28:48,569
Ready.

210
00:28:49,987 --> 00:28:51,071
Set.

211
00:28:53,991 --> 00:28:54,992
Go!

212
00:29:35,783 --> 00:29:37,159
I told you.

213
00:30:18,075 --> 00:30:19,243
Damn it!

214
00:30:21,453 --> 00:30:22,788
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

215
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:07,207
Damn it!

216
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:50,477
Don't leave town.

217
00:33:06,118 --> 00:33:08,245
Do you know what time it is?

218
00:33:08,412 --> 00:33:10,580
I thought it was around 7:00.

219
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:13,959
You know, US is a few hours behind.

220
00:33:16,878 --> 00:33:19,798
Looks like the party was better here, anyway.

221
00:33:22,676 --> 00:33:24,761
Have you been racing, Sean?

222
00:33:28,849 --> 00:33:30,600
You're out of here.

223
00:33:34,104 --> 00:33:35,355
Go ahead.

224
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,650
You don't get it, do you?

225
00:33:38,734 --> 00:33:40,861
You have nowhere else to go.

226
00:33:41,278 --> 00:33:45,407
If it doesn't work out here,
you're going to jail. Do you get that?

227
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:52,039
This isn't a game.
And I'm gonna tell you one more time,

228
00:33:52,414 --> 00:33:56,960
if you're gonna live under my roof,
you're gonna go by my rules or get out.

229
00:33:57,836 --> 00:33:59,212
Understand?

230
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,757
Understand?

231
00:34:02,841 --> 00:34:04,134
Yes, sir.

232
00:34:54,768 --> 00:34:56,019
Get in.

233
00:34:56,645 --> 00:34:58,605
I'll get you your money.

234
00:34:59,147 --> 00:35:01,858
Why you talking like you have a choice?

235
00:35:15,622 --> 00:35:19,084
There's a guy in there with a paw that owes me some money.

236
00:35:19,167 --> 00:35:20,335
A Paw?

237
00:35:21,878 --> 00:35:23,630
Go get me my money.

238
00:35:26,383 --> 00:35:27,509
Okay.

239
00:36:21,521 --> 00:36:23,899
Han said,

240
00:36:25,567 --> 00:36:27,027
<i>okane.</i>

241
00:36:35,118 --> 00:36:37,621
<i>Han send, okane.</i>

242
00:37:06,566 --> 00:37:07,859
Let's go.

243
00:37:15,825 --> 00:37:18,870
You're in the pickup and delivery business now.

244
00:37:18,954 --> 00:37:21,539
I might call you once a week or once an hour.

245
00:37:21,623 --> 00:37:24,918
I don't care if you're sick as a dog
or in bed with Beyoncé.

246
00:37:25,001 --> 00:37:26,670
I call, you show.

247
00:37:27,754 --> 00:37:31,591
- Only if you teach me how to drift.
- This ain't a negotiation.

248
00:37:32,008 --> 00:37:33,802
I wasn't negotiating.

249
00:38:22,225 --> 00:38:24,019
What's he doing here?

250
00:38:24,102 --> 00:38:28,064
He's paying me back for
that crumpled beer can sitting in my garage.

251
00:38:28,148 --> 00:38:30,025
Hope he's not driving.

252
00:38:33,111 --> 00:38:34,321
<i>Gaijin.</i>

253
00:38:35,572 --> 00:38:39,034
When is your next race?
I'd really like to be there.

254
00:38:40,577 --> 00:38:41,995
Why not be in it?

255
00:38:42,078 --> 00:38:46,541
You really a bad ass, cowboy, or you just talk like one?

256
00:38:47,208 --> 00:38:48,668
You heard me.

257
00:38:49,586 --> 00:38:51,921
Ready to lose another car, Han?

258
00:38:52,297 --> 00:38:55,550
I'm ready to take that '86 Corolla off your hands.

259
00:38:57,427 --> 00:38:58,762
All right.

260
00:38:59,095 --> 00:39:01,014
Put up the '72 Skyline.

261
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,266
Done.

262
00:39:05,268 --> 00:39:07,437
What do you think, Morimoto?

263
00:39:10,857 --> 00:39:12,609
Get him out of here.

264
00:39:13,443 --> 00:39:15,570
We have business to discuss.

265
00:39:25,622 --> 00:39:27,415
Your shipment's late.

266
00:39:27,499 --> 00:39:30,627
Since when are you so worried about the details?

267
00:39:32,504 --> 00:39:35,006
When is the shipment arriving, Han?

268
00:39:36,508 --> 00:39:39,135
Just sit pretty and let me handle it.

269
00:40:01,116 --> 00:40:02,784
Hey, Dad, it's me.

270
00:40:03,076 --> 00:40:06,996
I had to stay after school
for some extracurricular activities.

271
00:40:07,414 --> 00:40:09,416
So I'll be home a little later.

272
00:40:11,876 --> 00:40:12,961
Sir.

273
00:40:15,338 --> 00:40:18,258
You really need to stop following me around.

274
00:40:18,341 --> 00:40:20,343
What are you doing here?

275
00:40:20,593 --> 00:40:24,931
I thought I'd stop by and ask your boyfriend
for some drifting lessons.

276
00:40:25,223 --> 00:40:28,435
Trust me.
You don't wanna be a part of this world.

277
00:40:28,935 --> 00:40:30,645
It's good enough for you.

278
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:32,730
You don't know anything about me.

279
00:40:32,814 --> 00:40:35,108
Well, why don't you think I know?

280
00:40:35,191 --> 00:40:37,569
'Cause I'm a gaijin? An outsider?

281
00:40:39,195 --> 00:40:40,697
Let me guess.

282
00:40:41,197 --> 00:40:43,867
You're an army brat who moved around a lot.

283
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:46,453
Your mama and daddy was never home.

284
00:40:46,536 --> 00:40:49,456
So you walked around pissed off all the time.

285
00:40:49,539 --> 00:40:52,876
And now you found your family with these drift nuts.

286
00:40:56,588 --> 00:40:58,381
Zero for one, cowboy.

287
00:41:10,018 --> 00:41:14,189
Why can't you go find a nice Japanese girl
like the rest of the white guys around here?

288
00:41:19,861 --> 00:41:22,113
Is everything okay back there?

289
00:41:22,906 --> 00:41:24,532
I can handle DK.

290
00:41:25,492 --> 00:41:27,368
<i>I thought he's yakuza.</i>

291
00:41:28,036 --> 00:41:29,746
<i>His uncle's yakuza.</i>

292
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:34,250
He's just playing gangster in his little storage room.

293
00:41:37,086 --> 00:41:38,671
But I need him.

294
00:41:39,422 --> 00:41:42,592
He keeps Uncle Kamata from poking around too much.

295
00:41:43,092 --> 00:41:44,761
What do you mean?

296
00:41:45,762 --> 00:41:49,390
Well, his uncle gets a piece of the action
from everyone on his turf.

297
00:41:49,474 --> 00:41:51,142
We're on his turf.

298
00:41:52,393 --> 00:41:55,605
50% of something is better than 100% of nothing.

299
00:41:58,107 --> 00:41:59,943
So have you raced DK?

300
00:42:00,693 --> 00:42:02,820
Why not? Is he that good?

301
00:42:03,321 --> 00:42:05,448
What's the point of a race?

302
00:42:06,449 --> 00:42:08,910
To see if I'm better than the other guy.

303
00:42:08,993 --> 00:42:11,037
Just proves you're faster, that's all.

304
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:14,541
If I were to race, it would have to be
for something important.

305
00:42:14,624 --> 00:42:16,626
Or why else do it at all?

306
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,880
Why are you letting me race?

307
00:42:20,964 --> 00:42:23,174
'Cause you're DK's kryptonite.

308
00:42:24,676 --> 00:42:26,469
And you owe me a car.

309
00:42:49,158 --> 00:42:50,285
Oh, shit.

310
00:42:57,792 --> 00:42:58,960
What the...

311
00:42:59,043 --> 00:43:01,629
Police cars here are only factory-tuned.

312
00:43:01,713 --> 00:43:06,301
You can do better than 180 k,
they can't catch you, so they don't even try.

313
00:43:08,344 --> 00:43:12,015
You know what?
I'm beginning to like this country already.

314
00:43:27,822 --> 00:43:28,990
Danny!

315
00:43:29,907 --> 00:43:31,701
You're looking good.

316
00:43:34,871 --> 00:43:36,039
Disco.

317
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:45,465
We gotta catch up.
Get you a drink on me, huh?

318
00:43:45,548 --> 00:43:46,841
Let's go.

319
00:44:00,396 --> 00:44:01,397
Uh-oh.

320
00:44:01,689 --> 00:44:03,316
Easy now, ladies.

321
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:07,570
Come on.

322
00:44:11,324 --> 00:44:13,660
What's up? How you doing?

323
00:44:13,743 --> 00:44:15,078
Hey, baby.

324
00:44:33,596 --> 00:44:36,808
Keep your hands off the kid, girls.
He's underage.

325
00:44:39,018 --> 00:44:42,814
Ladies, ladies, ladies.
Disneyland for grownups, huh?

326
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:45,858
- All these girls, man, they look like...
- What, models?

327
00:44:45,942 --> 00:44:47,026
Check it out.

328
00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:50,279
See, Tokyo is the fashion capital
on this side of the planet, all right?

329
00:44:50,363 --> 00:44:53,241
Now, imagine you been posing all day.
I mean, that's a lot of hard work.

330
00:44:53,324 --> 00:44:54,909
Not only do you get tired, but, on top of that,

331
00:44:54,992 --> 00:44:58,538
you wanna have a little fun, but you can't
'cause you don't even know nobody in town.

332
00:44:58,621 --> 00:45:01,874
And most of the guys around here are
too chicken shit to even try picking up one.

333
00:45:01,958 --> 00:45:03,626
So what do you do?

334
00:45:04,502 --> 00:45:07,714
Man, you talk to the little dude who makes you laugh.

335
00:45:07,797 --> 00:45:08,881
Yeah.

336
00:45:09,799 --> 00:45:13,511
Look, man, I don't just think outside the box.
I tear it up.

337
00:45:13,594 --> 00:45:15,179
That's my thing.

338
00:45:15,304 --> 00:45:16,305
Yo!

339
00:45:23,396 --> 00:45:24,480
Sean!

340
00:46:09,525 --> 00:46:11,277
The red Evo's yours.

341
00:46:23,247 --> 00:46:24,874
What do you mean?

342
00:46:25,708 --> 00:46:27,293
You're representing me now.

343
00:46:27,376 --> 00:46:30,379
What you think, I'm gonna let you roll in a Hyundai?

344
00:46:56,239 --> 00:46:57,448
Oh, man.

345
00:47:02,995 --> 00:47:04,080
Damn it.

346
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:06,916
You call that drifting?

347
00:47:09,585 --> 00:47:13,381
My mother, she's blind in one eye
and she can drift better than that.

348
00:47:16,217 --> 00:47:18,302
Han, where did you find this guy?

349
00:47:19,512 --> 00:47:22,265
Will someone please teach this guy how to drift?

350
00:47:45,955 --> 00:47:47,456
Is that yours?

351
00:47:48,457 --> 00:47:49,750
Sure is.

352
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:58,593
What happened?

353
00:47:59,844 --> 00:48:03,264
I don't know. I found it this way at the base.

354
00:48:07,268 --> 00:48:08,728
It's got potential.

355
00:48:13,649 --> 00:48:15,985
Yeah, maybe. We'll see.

356
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:23,576
You know, Sean, the Japanese have a saying.

357
00:48:26,704 --> 00:48:29,165
"The nail that sticks out gets hammered."

358
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:35,004
You're gonna be late.

359
00:48:46,641 --> 00:48:47,725
Sean!

360
00:49:07,036 --> 00:49:09,705
That's for selling me a broken iPod!

361
00:49:09,872 --> 00:49:11,707
Come on, man, you broke it.

362
00:49:16,754 --> 00:49:18,130
Hey, whoa, whoa.

363
00:49:19,048 --> 00:49:21,217
There must be a misunderstanding.

364
00:49:21,884 --> 00:49:25,012
Out of my way, or you're next.

365
00:49:25,096 --> 00:49:28,015
- Take it easy.
- Look, man, I don't do refunds, all right?

366
00:49:28,099 --> 00:49:30,393
Okay, let's go, then! Let's go!

367
00:49:30,726 --> 00:49:32,144
Touch me again...

368
00:49:35,856 --> 00:49:36,941
Here.

369
00:49:38,067 --> 00:49:40,069
Try not to break this one.

370
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:57,086
Say, man!
What the hell is wrong with you, huh?

371
00:49:57,169 --> 00:50:00,006
Now everybody's gonna want exchanges around here.

372
00:50:00,089 --> 00:50:01,173
Damn!

373
00:50:13,769 --> 00:50:16,105
Not easy saving the day, is it?

374
00:50:16,856 --> 00:50:19,734
Maybe you could give me some pointers sometime.

375
00:50:19,817 --> 00:50:21,485
You're doing all right.

376
00:50:22,611 --> 00:50:23,779
Thanks.

377
00:50:27,283 --> 00:50:28,367
Hey.

378
00:50:29,577 --> 00:50:30,661
Yeah?

379
00:50:31,704 --> 00:50:33,831
Sorry about the other night.

380
00:50:34,457 --> 00:50:36,792
Your life isn't any of my business.

381
00:50:38,377 --> 00:50:39,754
It's okay.

382
00:51:02,068 --> 00:51:03,152
Foul!

383
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:05,863
- Ain't no damn foul.
- That was a foul.

384
00:51:05,946 --> 00:51:07,323
- Yo, you in my face.
- That was a foul.

385
00:51:07,406 --> 00:51:09,909
Hey, Han, sort this wanker out.

386
00:51:09,992 --> 00:51:11,243
A wanker?

387
00:51:11,327 --> 00:51:13,537
What do I look like, a zebra?

388
00:51:20,252 --> 00:51:22,838
So, how did you end up over here, anyway?

389
00:51:23,964 --> 00:51:26,342
Well, you know those old Westerns

390
00:51:27,051 --> 00:51:29,970
where the cowboys make a run for the border?

391
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,350
This is my Mexico.

392
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:40,564
Why'd you let me race with your car?

393
00:51:40,689 --> 00:51:42,942
You knew I was gonna wreck it.

394
00:51:43,526 --> 00:51:44,777
Why not?

395
00:51:46,028 --> 00:51:48,114
'Cause it's a lot of money.

396
00:51:48,197 --> 00:51:49,698
I have money.

397
00:51:51,033 --> 00:51:53,869
It's trust and character I need around me.

398
00:51:55,538 --> 00:51:59,708
You know, who you choose to be around
you lets you know who you are.

399
00:52:01,752 --> 00:52:05,339
And one car in exchange for knowing what a man's made of,

400
00:52:05,673 --> 00:52:07,967
that's a price I can live with.

401
00:52:12,179 --> 00:52:14,723
Look at all those people down there.

402
00:52:15,391 --> 00:52:17,726
They follow the rules, for what?

403
00:52:19,019 --> 00:52:21,313
They're letting fear lead them.

404
00:52:23,232 --> 00:52:25,359
What happens if they don't?

405
00:52:26,068 --> 00:52:30,406
Life's simple.
You make choices and you don't look back.

406
00:52:45,379 --> 00:52:48,757
<i>So, if you don't drift to win, what do you drift for?</i>

407
00:52:49,550 --> 00:52:52,178
<i>- You really want to know?
- Yeah.</i>

408
00:52:53,012 --> 00:52:54,555
<i>Okay. Let's go.</i>

409
00:54:11,966 --> 00:54:14,510
<i>There's no "wax on, wax off" with drifting.</i>

410
00:54:14,927 --> 00:54:16,345
Learn by doing it.

411
00:54:17,263 --> 00:54:21,433
The first drifters invented drifting
out here in the mountains by feeling it.

412
00:54:21,767 --> 00:54:23,143
So feel it.

413
00:54:35,739 --> 00:54:36,907
Again!

414
00:54:39,243 --> 00:54:41,704
- What's in this bag?
- You'll see.

415
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:45,082
How much you got?
Keep going, keep going.

416
00:54:51,547 --> 00:54:54,133
I'm so good, man, I could sell rubbers to a monk.

417
00:54:59,221 --> 00:55:00,222
Again.

418
00:55:22,369 --> 00:55:23,537
Again.

419
00:55:32,963 --> 00:55:35,716
Watch it. Watch it. Not too early, now.

420
00:55:41,388 --> 00:55:43,349
Go, go, go, go!

421
00:55:52,858 --> 00:55:54,693
Not bad.

422
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:56,779
Don't lose it! Don't lose it!

423
00:56:34,733 --> 00:56:35,984
Hey Han...

424
00:56:36,819 --> 00:56:38,445
Take a look at this.

425
00:56:42,074 --> 00:56:43,534
You have a visitor.

426
00:56:48,330 --> 00:56:51,792
Hey, Twink. Get this man a bunk.

427
00:58:06,658 --> 00:58:08,368
Pleasure doing business.

428
00:58:12,206 --> 00:58:15,209
Yeah, baby. I told you. I told you, didn't I?

429
00:58:54,873 --> 00:58:58,794
It's actually not bad.
I didn't even have to put ketchup on it.

430
00:58:59,878 --> 00:59:02,005
See, I'm not a total gaijin.

431
00:59:03,799 --> 00:59:07,886
I hate that word. It's what they used
to call me when I was a kid.

432
00:59:09,304 --> 00:59:11,515
I thought you were born here.

433
00:59:11,598 --> 00:59:14,685
Well, "outsider" can mean many different things.

434
00:59:19,982 --> 00:59:22,025
My mom died when I was 10.

435
00:59:23,402 --> 00:59:26,863
She came out here from Australia
when she finished high school.

436
00:59:26,989 --> 00:59:31,076
And all I know about her is
that she went to work in a hostess bar.

437
00:59:34,204 --> 00:59:36,331
DK's grandmother took me in.

438
00:59:39,501 --> 00:59:42,379
Well, my parents split up when I was three.

439
00:59:43,589 --> 00:59:47,259
Me and Mom moved around a lot.
Mostly 'cause of me.

440
00:59:48,927 --> 00:59:51,263
Well, it was all 'cause of me.

441
00:59:53,181 --> 00:59:55,684
Kind of made myself an outsider, you know,

442
00:59:55,892 --> 00:59:58,186
without even thinking about it.

443
01:00:00,314 --> 01:00:04,318
But I realize now, outsider or insider,
it doesn't really matter.

444
01:00:05,110 --> 01:00:08,196
All that matters is knowing what you really want

445
01:00:09,197 --> 01:00:10,907
and going after it.

446
01:00:31,053 --> 01:00:33,847
We used to come up here when we were kids.

447
01:00:34,306 --> 01:00:37,643
Even before we could drive we'd cut class, sneak out,

448
01:00:37,726 --> 01:00:40,270
come up here, and watch the older kids drift.

449
01:00:46,985 --> 01:00:49,029
Things were different back then.

450
01:00:53,075 --> 01:00:55,911
Once I got my license, I practically lived up here.

451
01:00:56,495 --> 01:00:59,081
Back then, kids just drove whatever they had.

452
01:00:59,247 --> 01:01:01,917
You know, we just made do.
No one bothered us.

453
01:01:03,335 --> 01:01:07,422
The day I got my license
is the day I got my first speeding ticket.

454
01:01:07,506 --> 01:01:09,925
The day after that, I won my first race.

455
01:01:10,425 --> 01:01:12,969
I beat this rich kid by three lengths.

456
01:01:13,970 --> 01:01:16,723
I gotta admit, it felt good.

457
01:01:18,517 --> 01:01:19,810
It felt like...

458
01:01:20,102 --> 01:01:22,312
Like everything else just disappears.

459
01:01:24,314 --> 01:01:27,484
- No past and no future.
- No problems.

460
01:01:29,861 --> 01:01:31,446
Just the moment.

461
01:01:54,970 --> 01:01:56,638
Boy needs to chill.

462
01:01:59,141 --> 01:02:01,351
Hey, Twink, I'm gonna grab another set.

463
01:02:01,435 --> 01:02:03,687
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Another set?

464
01:02:03,979 --> 01:02:08,108
No. Look, that was your third set today.
I mean, them tires ain't cheap.

465
01:02:18,493 --> 01:02:22,080
DK, grab a chair.
We're about to roast some marshmallows.

466
01:02:23,123 --> 01:02:24,833
Yo, come on, man, look...

467
01:02:37,179 --> 01:02:38,930
Stay away from her,

468
01:02:39,139 --> 01:02:42,434
or the only thing you'll be driving is a wheelchair.

469
01:02:48,482 --> 01:02:50,275
Find yourself a new driver.

470
01:03:03,079 --> 01:03:05,540
- I'm all right.
- What'd you expect?

471
01:03:06,333 --> 01:03:10,003
You didn't just play with fire,
you soaked the matches in gasoline.

472
01:03:33,401 --> 01:03:34,736
It's over.

473
01:03:55,507 --> 01:03:58,844
- All this over a gaijin?
- I am a gaijin.

474
01:04:01,763 --> 01:04:03,473
You've changed, DK.

475
01:04:08,854 --> 01:04:10,647
You say I've changed.

476
01:04:12,983 --> 01:04:15,610
But we're not so different, you and I.

477
01:04:16,903 --> 01:04:19,739
We're both products of screw ups, aren't we?

478
01:04:25,745 --> 01:04:28,999
They say your mom was the best trick

479
01:04:29,082 --> 01:04:31,626
in all of Kabukicho back in the day.

480
01:04:32,127 --> 01:04:33,753
Leave my mother out of this.

481
01:04:33,837 --> 01:04:37,257
If we hadn't taken you in, you'd be just like her,

482
01:04:38,133 --> 01:04:40,176
doing anything for a buck.

483
01:04:41,303 --> 01:04:45,307
Think anyone would take a second look
at you if it wasn't for your uncle?

484
01:04:58,904 --> 01:05:00,780
We're the same, Neela.

485
01:05:04,659 --> 01:05:07,829
Difference is I know who I am and where I belong.

486
01:05:13,752 --> 01:05:15,712
Do you know who you are?

487
01:05:18,548 --> 01:05:22,052
Do you know where you belong?

488
01:05:41,321 --> 01:05:42,364
Hey.

489
01:05:47,410 --> 01:05:48,662
Come on.

490
01:06:32,316 --> 01:06:33,317
Uncle.

491
01:06:35,861 --> 01:06:39,490
Uncle Kamata, I was just about to go see you.

492
01:06:40,241 --> 01:06:42,785
Have you been well?

493
01:06:42,868 --> 01:06:43,869
Yes.

494
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:46,664
Here's last week's take.

495
01:06:47,957 --> 01:06:51,335
Business good?

496
01:06:53,337 --> 01:06:54,463
Please.

497
01:07:04,890 --> 01:07:06,808
To tell you the truth...

498
01:07:09,937 --> 01:07:12,314
I look over these printouts of yours...

499
01:07:13,190 --> 01:07:17,277
and I don't understand half of what I'm looking at.

500
01:07:19,196 --> 01:07:21,532
It looks more complicated than it is.

501
01:07:23,784 --> 01:07:28,163
Then how is it even I am able to figure out...

502
01:07:30,082 --> 01:07:35,671
that your partner is stealing from us?

503
01:07:39,091 --> 01:07:40,842
Even if that were true...

504
01:07:41,718 --> 01:07:45,597
It couldn't have been much, uncle.
I would've caught it.

505
01:07:50,060 --> 01:07:52,145
There's an old saying:

506
01:07:53,939 --> 01:07:55,899
For want of a nail...

507
01:07:56,441 --> 01:07:58,443
the horseshoe was lost.

508
01:08:00,112 --> 01:08:03,532
For want of a horseshoe, the steed was lost.

509
01:08:04,616 --> 01:08:06,535
For want of a steed...

510
01:08:07,703 --> 01:08:09,746
the message was not delivered.

511
01:08:11,540 --> 01:08:13,792
For want of an undelivered message...

512
01:08:15,961 --> 01:08:17,879
the war was lost.

513
01:08:34,062 --> 01:08:37,274
I miss your father.

514
01:09:33,789 --> 01:09:35,040
Hey, brother.

515
01:09:36,041 --> 01:09:39,252
I vouched for you!
Put my reputation on the line for you!

516
01:09:39,503 --> 01:09:40,837
We were partners!

517
01:09:41,254 --> 01:09:44,091
You think you can keep your side deals from me?

518
01:09:44,174 --> 01:09:47,094
Come on. We ain't in the Boy Scouts.

519
01:09:47,928 --> 01:09:50,347
- This is what we do.
- Takashi!

520
01:09:57,521 --> 01:09:59,064
What about now?

521
01:09:59,314 --> 01:10:00,482
Hmm?

522
01:10:01,191 --> 01:10:02,943
Is this what we do?

523
01:10:04,486 --> 01:10:06,113
Man, you need me.

524
01:10:06,363 --> 01:10:09,908
You'd still be shaking down tea houses
for chump change if it wasn't for me.

525
01:10:19,418 --> 01:10:22,212
- Get in!
- Go! Go! Go!

526
01:10:26,258 --> 01:10:27,509
Come on.

527
01:13:49,127 --> 01:13:50,503
Sean, Sean!

528
01:16:36,211 --> 01:16:37,212
Takashi.

529
01:16:37,796 --> 01:16:38,797
Get in.

530
01:16:46,554 --> 01:16:48,723
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

531
01:16:59,109 --> 01:17:00,235
Okay.

532
01:17:01,444 --> 01:17:02,821
I'll go with you.

533
01:17:03,321 --> 01:17:04,489
Neela.

534
01:17:15,542 --> 01:17:17,877
See you when Daddy's not around.

535
01:17:41,359 --> 01:17:43,528
- I'm putting you on a plane tonight.
- Dad...

536
01:17:43,611 --> 01:17:45,238
Sean, don't argue with me.

537
01:17:45,321 --> 01:17:48,116
I did this. I can't run away.

538
01:17:49,284 --> 01:17:50,285
I can't.

539
01:17:50,368 --> 01:17:54,080
Sean, I'm your father.
I'm responsible for your well-being.

540
01:17:54,622 --> 01:17:56,666
And I'm responsible for my mess.

541
01:17:59,794 --> 01:18:01,588
I gotta do this.

542
01:18:03,798 --> 01:18:05,758
Can you understand that?

543
01:18:21,816 --> 01:18:24,527
At least you're not redoing my mistakes.

544
01:18:53,264 --> 01:18:55,016
You all right, man?

545
01:18:58,895 --> 01:19:02,232
We're leaving town.
Look, I know some people...

546
01:19:04,317 --> 01:19:06,110
I can't do it, Twink.

547
01:19:07,070 --> 01:19:10,156
Look, DK wants your head.

548
01:19:11,032 --> 01:19:12,367
All right?

549
01:19:12,784 --> 01:19:17,080
And the trouble you just made for Kamata?
You're done here, bro.

550
01:19:19,624 --> 01:19:23,044
- Maybe I should talk to Kamata.
- What?

551
01:19:24,587 --> 01:19:26,256
DK answers to him.

552
01:19:29,050 --> 01:19:31,344
I know I just didn't hear that.

553
01:19:33,346 --> 01:19:36,724
I gotta end this. I'm gonna go talk to him.

554
01:19:36,808 --> 01:19:38,810
What, are you crazy, huh?

555
01:19:39,018 --> 01:19:40,603
Han is dead, all right!

556
01:19:40,687 --> 01:19:43,690
Plus, you can't just walk into Kamata's place, man!

557
01:19:46,818 --> 01:19:48,361
It's all I got.

558
01:19:54,951 --> 01:19:58,121
Something I think Han would've wanted you to have.

559
01:20:12,719 --> 01:20:14,137
What's this?

560
01:20:15,763 --> 01:20:20,184
You're gonna need it if you're gonna
make it out of Kamata's place alive.

561
01:20:23,271 --> 01:20:24,939
Don't you need it?

562
01:20:26,649 --> 01:20:30,153
No, it's cool. Look, I'll figure it out.

563
01:21:03,853 --> 01:21:07,148
I'd like to see Mr. Kamata, please.

564
01:21:40,056 --> 01:21:41,140
Sean.

565
01:21:45,895 --> 01:21:47,563
You need to leave.

566
01:21:47,897 --> 01:21:50,024
You came to the wrong place.

567
01:21:50,191 --> 01:21:52,402
I didn't come here to see you.

568
01:21:52,819 --> 01:21:54,070
Takashi.

569
01:21:54,904 --> 01:21:56,614
Who's your friend?

570
01:21:58,241 --> 01:21:59,242
Nobody.

571
01:22:00,284 --> 01:22:01,702
I can handle this.

572
01:22:02,495 --> 01:22:05,790
I have something which belongs to you, sir.

573
01:22:22,682 --> 01:22:23,933
You think

574
01:22:25,017 --> 01:22:29,564
you can walk in here, dump some cash and walk out?

575
01:22:31,691 --> 01:22:35,736
I know I'm only returning what belonged
to you in the first place, sir.

576
01:22:37,238 --> 01:22:39,449
But that's not why I really came.

577
01:22:40,116 --> 01:22:42,118
I came here to apologize.

578
01:22:44,370 --> 01:22:47,999
I know your nephew and I have embarrassed ourselves badly.

579
01:22:48,124 --> 01:22:50,126
Don't listen to this gaijin.

580
01:22:51,461 --> 01:22:52,503
Takashi...

581
01:22:54,005 --> 01:22:56,883
after everything you've done, you're giving me orders?

582
01:22:56,966 --> 01:22:58,134
I apologize.

583
01:22:59,969 --> 01:23:03,764
Sir, I'm here to offer you a peaceful solution.

584
01:23:06,392 --> 01:23:08,853
How do you plan to accomplish that?

585
01:23:10,313 --> 01:23:11,481
A race.

586
01:23:16,694 --> 01:23:20,823
DK and I have caused nothing but problems for you, for us.

587
01:23:22,575 --> 01:23:26,537
And I'm asking you to allow us to settle this,
once and for all.

588
01:23:28,372 --> 01:23:29,582
We race

589
01:23:31,334 --> 01:23:33,419
and the loser leaves town for good.

590
01:23:33,503 --> 01:23:36,339
I've already beat this piece of shit once!

591
01:23:36,506 --> 01:23:37,632
Good.

592
01:23:38,591 --> 01:23:41,010
Then it should be easy.

593
01:24:19,549 --> 01:24:21,676
The cops took all the cars.

594
01:24:21,926 --> 01:24:23,010
Hey!

595
01:25:39,503 --> 01:25:41,213
That's why she's spitting.

596
01:26:04,654 --> 01:26:08,199
We almost there, Twink.
Couple more tweaks.

597
01:26:09,742 --> 01:26:12,119
It's not the car I'm worried about, man.

598
01:26:13,496 --> 01:26:16,999
DK picked this road for a reason.
This is his mountain.

599
01:26:19,502 --> 01:26:22,630
He's the only one to ever make it to the bottom.

600
01:30:16,571 --> 01:30:17,655
Yeah!

601
01:30:24,913 --> 01:30:26,581
- Yeah!
- Yes!

602
01:31:25,140 --> 01:31:26,141
Come on.

603
01:31:37,360 --> 01:31:38,611
Yeah! Come on!

604
01:31:38,695 --> 01:31:41,322
- Come on, Sean.
- Let's go! Let's go!

605
01:31:41,406 --> 01:31:43,032
Sean, you the boss. Let's go.

606
01:32:11,477 --> 01:32:13,730
Damn! Come on, man! That ain't right.

607
01:34:23,818 --> 01:34:25,862
Yeah, baby!
That's what I'm talking about, man.

608
01:34:25,945 --> 01:34:27,322
I told you!

609
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:57,435
You're free to go.

610
01:35:32,095 --> 01:35:34,222
Hey, yo, Sean! Yo, Sean!

611
01:35:34,889 --> 01:35:36,599
Hey, check this out, man.

612
01:35:36,891 --> 01:35:39,727
This dude over here wanna race the new DK.

613
01:35:40,728 --> 01:35:43,523
Heard he's been beating everybody around Asia, too.

614
01:35:43,606 --> 01:35:45,441
Not tonight, Twinkie.

615
01:35:48,903 --> 01:35:50,571
Said he knew Han.

616
01:35:57,161 --> 01:35:58,913
Said Han was family.

617
01:36:12,927 --> 01:36:14,262
All right.

618
01:36:14,637 --> 01:36:15,763
Let's race.

619
01:36:42,999 --> 01:36:44,333
Nice ride.

620
01:36:44,792 --> 01:36:47,795
I won it from my friend Han, a few years ago.

621
01:36:49,881 --> 01:36:52,550
I didn't know he was into American muscle.

622
01:36:52,633 --> 01:36:55,136
He was when he was rolling with me.

623
01:36:57,763 --> 01:37:00,224
You know this ain't no 10-second race.

624
01:37:00,683 --> 01:37:02,602
I got nothing but time.

625
01:37:06,189 --> 01:37:07,732
You ready, kid?

626
01:37:18,618 --> 01:37:20,286
Come on, Sean! Come on!

627
01:37:22,330 --> 01:37:23,498
Ready!

628
01:37:26,584 --> 01:37:27,668
Set!

629
01:37:31,964 --> 01:37:33,007
Go!
