00:04:00,432 --> 00:04:04,502
Ja-James, what are you doing?

3
00:04:06,971 --> 00:04:10,440
Something that I should have
done a long time ago.

4
00:04:27,254 --> 00:04:31,422
Top university, tenure
position, fully-furnished house.

5
00:04:31,424 --> 00:04:33,593
Who cares where it is?

6
00:04:34,426 --> 00:04:36,592
One plus one?

7
00:04:36,594 --> 00:04:38,427
Two.

8
00:04:38,429 --> 00:04:40,029
You're a genius.

9
00:04:40,031 --> 00:04:42,130
No wonder they hired you
to teach math.

10
00:04:42,132 --> 00:04:44,567
I thought it was because
of my incredible charm...

11
00:04:44,569 --> 00:04:46,667
and my devilish handsome,
good looks.

12
00:04:46,669 --> 00:04:51,537
Unh-unh, that's why I married
you and let you knock me up.

13
00:04:51,539 --> 00:04:54,642
So how is little "Adam Jr."
dealing with the big move...

14
00:04:54,644 --> 00:04:56,109
leaving the city?

15
00:04:56,111 --> 00:04:59,678
Little "Lisa Jr." is doing
just fine.

16
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,514
It's her daddy I'm worried
about.

17
00:05:01,516 --> 00:05:02,548
Me?

18
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,650
Yes, you hate the country.

19
00:05:04,652 --> 00:05:05,919
I do not.

20
00:05:18,963 --> 00:05:20,664
Wow, would you look at that?

21
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:24,632
I'm looking. Oh, the house
isn't bad, either.

22
00:05:27,537 --> 00:05:29,504
- Professor Pierce?
- Yes?

23
00:05:29,506 --> 00:05:30,538
Hi, I'm David.

24
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,072
Nice to meet you.

25
00:05:32,074 --> 00:05:33,573
I think I'm gonna be in your
linear algebra class.

26
00:05:33,575 --> 00:05:35,042
Oh, yeah?

27
00:05:35,044 --> 00:05:36,676
Yeah. And you must be
Mrs. Pierce.

28
00:05:36,678 --> 00:05:39,711
Oh, Mrs. Pierce makes me sound
like my mother-in-law.

29
00:05:39,713 --> 00:05:40,613
Please, call me Lisa.

30
00:05:40,615 --> 00:05:42,348
Sure thing, Lisa.

31
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,550
Mrs. Pierce is fine.

32
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:46,451
Oh, hey, let me help you
with that.

33
00:05:46,453 --> 00:05:47,953
- Oh, thank you.
- Yeah.

34
00:05:47,955 --> 00:05:49,587
So what brings you out here,
David?

35
00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:51,288
Class doesn't start till Monday.

36
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:53,623
I've got your keys, professor.

37
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:56,658
Yeah, they give them to all
their students.

38
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,595
Nah, I'm just kidding. It's a...
it's a work study program.

39
00:05:59,597 --> 00:06:02,564
The university pays me to keep
up some of the properties.

40
00:06:02,566 --> 00:06:04,001
Yours included.

41
00:06:08,539 --> 00:06:10,471
Here you go, professor.

42
00:06:10,473 --> 00:06:11,605
Thank you.

43
00:06:11,607 --> 00:06:13,074
Door's already open, though.

44
00:06:13,076 --> 00:06:14,507
We don't really keep 'em locked
around here.

45
00:06:14,509 --> 00:06:16,075
Oh, is that safe?

46
00:06:16,077 --> 00:06:18,044
Well, in my experience most
people's problems...

47
00:06:18,046 --> 00:06:19,415
happen behind closed doors.

48
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:24,582
Oh, yeah, professor,
uh, someone sent you a gift.

49
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:26,151
I put it inside.

50
00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:27,718
Gift?

51
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,391
Come on, "Professor."
Let's see your new home.

52
00:06:40,064 --> 00:06:42,667
Wow, this place must
really need a math teacher.

53
00:06:57,779 --> 00:06:59,778
- Wow.
- Yes.

54
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,748
Still missing the city?

55
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,582
Not anymore.

56
00:07:03,584 --> 00:07:08,120
I think this table alone is
bigger than our old apartment.

57
00:07:08,122 --> 00:07:10,254
It's from your sister.

58
00:07:10,256 --> 00:07:13,590
Do I dare ask how it got here
before we did?

59
00:07:13,592 --> 00:07:15,457
Be nice. I gave her the address.

60
00:07:15,459 --> 00:07:18,193
The last time we saw your
sister, she almost burned...

61
00:07:18,195 --> 00:07:19,762
down our apartment with candles
and incense.

62
00:07:19,764 --> 00:07:22,631
It's a house-warming gift.
She's not so bad.

63
00:07:22,633 --> 00:07:25,503
As long as she doesn't pop out
of here, I'll agree with you.

64
00:07:28,772 --> 00:07:30,705
That's beautiful.

65
00:07:30,707 --> 00:07:32,205
Beautiful.

66
00:07:32,207 --> 00:07:34,240
Your sister sent us a box
that doesn't open.

67
00:07:34,242 --> 00:07:37,276
"This fertility box will keep
you company...

68
00:07:37,278 --> 00:07:39,345
"until I come to visit. See you
soon."

69
00:07:39,347 --> 00:07:40,646
She's coming to visit already?

70
00:07:40,648 --> 00:07:43,551
Shush. She's not here now.

71
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:47,351
No, she's not.

72
00:07:47,353 --> 00:07:51,555
So let's go create some problems
behind closed doors.

73
00:07:51,557 --> 00:07:58,393
Yes, ma'am. After you,
Mrs. Pierce, come on, come on.

74
00:07:58,395 --> 00:07:59,094
Don't.

75
00:07:59,096 --> 00:08:01,563
Oh, for the love of everything.

76
00:08:01,565 --> 00:08:02,733
No, no, slow down.

77
00:08:07,838 --> 00:08:09,272
Our room...

78
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:18,146
And this is Adam Jr.'s room.

79
00:08:22,148 --> 00:08:25,617
Lisa Jr.'s gonna love it here.

80
00:08:25,619 --> 00:08:28,255
Her dad's gonna love it here,
too.

81
00:08:31,623 --> 00:08:33,558
Oh, this looks kinda heavy.

82
00:08:35,393 --> 00:08:37,863
Guess I have my first
after-school project.

83
00:08:41,732 --> 00:08:42,798
What is it? What's wrong?

84
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,702
What if I'm not a good mom?

85
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,369
You're gonna be a great mom.

86
00:08:48,371 --> 00:08:51,404
How do you know?

87
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:56,477
You're loving, you're kind,
and you're loyal.

88
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,112
Go on.

89
00:08:59,114 --> 00:09:00,746
And nurturing...

90
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:02,580
What about protective?

91
00:09:02,582 --> 00:09:08,321
And protective. And you're
beautiful, and sexy.

92
00:09:20,831 --> 00:09:22,330
You really wanna do this here?

93
00:09:22,332 --> 00:09:23,802
I don't care where.

94
00:09:25,369 --> 00:09:26,401
Just now.

95
00:09:26,403 --> 00:09:27,371
All right.

96
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:48,285
First day of school.
How do I look?

97
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,390
All you need's a pipe.

98
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,493
No.

99
00:09:54,793 --> 00:09:55,861
It's perfect.

100
00:09:57,461 --> 00:10:00,396
Please be careful today.
No heavy lifting.

101
00:10:00,398 --> 00:10:02,897
I'm pregnant, not breakable,
remember?

102
00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:04,866
Walking, even jogging is
healthy.

103
00:10:04,868 --> 00:10:05,867
Walking, please.

104
00:10:05,869 --> 00:10:07,434
Okay, fine.

105
00:10:07,436 --> 00:10:09,370
Or maybe I'll just
put together the crib then.

106
00:10:09,372 --> 00:10:11,404
No, no, no, don't do that.

107
00:10:11,406 --> 00:10:13,473
I promise I'll do it when
I get home.

108
00:10:13,475 --> 00:10:18,513
Good, because pretty soon, one
plus one is gonna equal three.

109
00:10:20,813 --> 00:10:22,880
I love your logic.

110
00:10:22,882 --> 00:10:24,351
Go get 'em, professor.

111
00:10:52,473 --> 00:10:54,610
A box that doesn't open...

112
00:11:21,798 --> 00:11:22,766
Huh.

113
00:11:40,948 --> 00:11:43,915
Just remember, no matter how
complicated the problem...

114
00:11:43,917 --> 00:11:47,585
the solution is always logical.

115
00:11:47,587 --> 00:11:52,421
Math, and life for that matter,
are very reliable in that way.

116
00:11:52,423 --> 00:11:55,425
All you have to do is logically
work through the problem...

117
00:11:55,427 --> 00:11:57,392
and the solution will appear.

118
00:11:57,394 --> 00:12:01,497
Numbers are always rational...
except, of course...

119
00:12:01,499 --> 00:12:04,299
when they're being irrational.

120
00:13:12,857 --> 00:13:14,791
Thank you, everyone, and don't
forget to read chapter one...

121
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:16,894
in your books before our
next meeting.

122
00:13:17,962 --> 00:13:19,561
Good first class, professor.

123
00:13:19,563 --> 00:13:20,762
Thank you, David.

124
00:13:20,764 --> 00:13:21,997
Glad to see you in a shirt
today.

125
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,407
Hello.

126
00:13:34,409 --> 00:13:38,344
"All of math's and life's problems
can be solved using logic?"

127
00:13:38,346 --> 00:13:39,945
You wouldn't agree?

128
00:13:39,947 --> 00:13:43,981
One plus one doesn't always
equal two.

129
00:13:43,983 --> 00:13:45,049
You sound like my wife.

130
00:13:45,051 --> 00:13:46,984
Smart lady you have there.

131
00:13:46,986 --> 00:13:49,354
Adam Pierce. We haven't met yet.

132
00:13:49,356 --> 00:13:51,954
Ronald Clark.

133
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,090
As in Dr. Clark, head of the
Math Department?

134
00:13:54,092 --> 00:13:58,026
I also teach a
course in parapsychology.

135
00:13:58,028 --> 00:14:00,129
That's an interesting
combination of subjects.

136
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:02,864
Logic by day, superstition
by night.

137
00:14:02,866 --> 00:14:06,567
Mm. "There are more things in
the heaven and earth, Horatio...

138
00:14:06,569 --> 00:14:10,003
"than are dreamt of in your
philosophy."

139
00:14:10,005 --> 00:14:13,005
Yeah, I guess I'm more of a
science and logic kind of guy.

140
00:14:13,007 --> 00:14:14,172
Oh, me, too.

141
00:14:14,174 --> 00:14:17,109
Being blind, though, has a way
of opening your eyes...

142
00:14:17,111 --> 00:14:21,045
to what's really going on
in the world.

143
00:14:21,047 --> 00:14:22,146
Sorry. I didn't mean to offend.

144
00:14:22,148 --> 00:14:24,750
Oh, don't apologize, professor.

145
00:14:24,752 --> 00:14:27,421
I'm sitting in your class,
not you in mine.

146
00:14:29,589 --> 00:14:32,889
I'm not complaining, but do you
have any idea why...

147
00:14:32,891 --> 00:14:36,860
the university offered me such
a good package to teach here?

148
00:14:36,862 --> 00:14:40,595
We have a shortage of qualified
math teachers.

149
00:14:40,597 --> 00:14:44,665
Evidently, my superstition class
scares off...

150
00:14:44,667 --> 00:14:48,169
some of the more qualified
academics.

151
00:14:48,171 --> 00:14:50,102
And the school still lets you
teach it?

152
00:14:50,104 --> 00:14:52,705
The students love it.

153
00:14:52,707 --> 00:14:56,409
Consequently, their parents'
checkbooks love it.

154
00:14:56,411 --> 00:14:59,981
And I suppose that the administrators
don't want to tempt fate.

155
00:15:46,152 --> 00:15:47,788
Excuse me?

156
00:15:51,156 --> 00:15:53,426
Miss? Are you okay?

157
00:15:58,161 --> 00:16:00,196
I, I lost my baby.

158
00:16:00,198 --> 00:16:02,600
Oh, my God. We have
to get you to a hospital.

159
00:16:04,099 --> 00:16:05,099
I'm not well...

160
00:16:05,101 --> 00:16:07,571
No, w-we need to get you
some help.

161
00:16:12,475 --> 00:16:15,074
You're not well, either.

162
00:16:15,076 --> 00:16:16,545
I'm sorry?

163
00:16:19,681 --> 00:16:21,681
You're afraid of me?

164
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:25,951
Soon, everyone will be afraid
of you.

165
00:16:25,953 --> 00:16:28,018
I don't mean-mean to bother you.
I don't want any trouble.

166
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,855
Then don't care for it.

167
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:33,089
Don't love it. Don't protect it.

168
00:16:33,091 --> 00:16:34,794
It's not yours anymore.

169
00:16:45,033 --> 00:16:48,502
Hey, babe, how was your walk,
not run?

170
00:16:48,504 --> 00:16:51,036
Actually, I just got a little
spooked out in the forest.

171
00:16:51,038 --> 00:16:52,172
Yeah? What happened?

172
00:16:52,174 --> 00:16:55,909
I ran into this creepy woman out
there, covered in blood.

173
00:16:55,911 --> 00:16:57,576
What? What happened?
Are you all right?

174
00:16:57,578 --> 00:16:59,745
I'm fine, I just...
She just really freaked me out.

175
00:16:59,747 --> 00:17:01,813
I thought she needed help,
but then maybe she didn't.

176
00:17:01,815 --> 00:17:05,817
And she started saying these
really crazy things.

177
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:08,585
Was she playing a banjo?
Missing some teeth?

178
00:17:08,587 --> 00:17:13,156
No... but she was really dirty.

179
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:16,058
Are you gonna be all right?
You need me to come home?

180
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,927
No. No, don't be silly.
I'm fine.

181
00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:22,696
I just wanted to hear
your voice.

182
00:17:22,698 --> 00:17:25,834
<i>All right, I love you.</i>

183
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,103
I love you, too.

184
00:21:10,222 --> 00:21:11,691
Oh, my God.

185
00:22:00,797 --> 00:22:02,965
Lisa, I'm home.

186
00:22:05,534 --> 00:22:08,337
Glad to see we're locking
the doors again.

187
00:22:13,341 --> 00:22:14,809
Hey.

188
00:22:25,251 --> 00:22:26,286
Lisa?

189
00:22:29,788 --> 00:22:31,257
Lisa, you sleepin'?

190
00:22:47,536 --> 00:22:49,836
Lisa?

191
00:23:00,313 --> 00:23:01,315
Lisa!

192
00:23:25,402 --> 00:23:27,266
Yes? How is she?

193
00:23:27,268 --> 00:23:29,102
It was touch and go there
for a moment...

194
00:23:29,104 --> 00:23:31,404
but your wife's going to be
okay.

195
00:23:31,406 --> 00:23:34,073
Thank you.

196
00:23:34,075 --> 00:23:37,876
She suffered a miscarriage,
and then she hemorrhaged.

197
00:23:37,878 --> 00:23:39,611
She must've been lifting
something heavy...

198
00:23:39,613 --> 00:23:42,048
lucky you found her when
you did.

199
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:53,589
She was exercising, stretching,
walking, maybe jogging.

200
00:23:53,591 --> 00:23:55,624
No, that all sounds pretty
healthy.

201
00:23:55,626 --> 00:23:58,426
It had to be something else.

202
00:23:58,428 --> 00:24:02,431
The amount of trauma that I saw
internally was pretty extensive.

203
00:24:05,635 --> 00:24:06,933
Can I see her?

204
00:24:06,935 --> 00:24:12,105
Yes, but there's something else.

205
00:24:12,107 --> 00:24:14,809
Your wife won't be able to have
children anymore.

206
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:18,313
I'm sorry.

207
00:24:39,062 --> 00:24:40,531
How are you, darling?

208
00:24:41,899 --> 00:24:42,934
Terrible.

209
00:24:47,136 --> 00:24:48,968
I was so worried about you...

210
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:51,973
but the doctor says you're gonna
be okay.

211
00:24:53,908 --> 00:24:56,407
No, I'm not. I lost the baby.

212
00:24:56,409 --> 00:25:00,611
I can't have children.
How am I gonna be okay?

213
00:25:00,613 --> 00:25:02,245
We still have each other.

214
00:25:02,247 --> 00:25:04,884
We're gonna get through this,
I promise you.

215
00:25:06,586 --> 00:25:08,151
The crib...

216
00:25:08,153 --> 00:25:11,354
It was too heavy? You were
trying to put it together?

217
00:25:11,356 --> 00:25:14,589
No, it wasn't... I heard crying.

218
00:25:14,591 --> 00:25:20,661
Adam... I saw our daughter.

219
00:25:20,663 --> 00:25:26,099
I held Lisa Jr. in my arms.
And then I woke up here.

220
00:25:26,101 --> 00:25:28,936
Babe? I don't understand.
I don't...

221
00:25:28,938 --> 00:25:32,338
There's my big sister.

222
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:37,279
Hi. Don't worry, Becky's here
to take care of you.

223
00:25:38,144 --> 00:25:39,644
Hey.

224
00:25:39,646 --> 00:25:40,946
How are you, Becky?

225
00:25:40,948 --> 00:25:42,379
I'm good, Adam.

226
00:25:42,381 --> 00:25:45,051
Hey, do you wanna give us a few
minutes of some girl time?

227
00:25:48,353 --> 00:25:49,587
Thank you.

228
00:26:00,664 --> 00:26:05,633
Sugar, salt, gluten. There's
nothing healthy in here at all.

229
00:26:05,635 --> 00:26:08,268
How is she doing?

230
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,669
She's resting now.

231
00:26:09,671 --> 00:26:11,738
She'll probably sleep through
the night.

232
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,639
Do you need me to drop you
off at the house...

233
00:26:13,641 --> 00:26:15,473
so you can get settled
or anything?

234
00:26:15,475 --> 00:26:18,210
Oh, no, I'm staying here
with my sister.

235
00:26:18,212 --> 00:26:19,579
I'll leave when she does.

236
00:26:21,448 --> 00:26:26,352
I'm not going to deal with your
shit, Becky. Not this time.

237
00:26:51,005 --> 00:26:52,338
Welcome home, Lisa.

238
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:54,007
Thank you, David.

239
00:26:54,009 --> 00:26:56,141
Hi, I'm Becky, I'm Lisa's
sister.

240
00:26:56,143 --> 00:26:57,241
Pleasure to meet you, ma'am.

241
00:26:57,243 --> 00:26:58,710
The pleasure's all mine.

242
00:26:58,712 --> 00:26:59,644
Can I get your bag?

243
00:26:59,646 --> 00:27:01,046
Yes, please.

244
00:27:01,048 --> 00:27:02,380
Here you go.

245
00:27:02,382 --> 00:27:04,248
Thanks. I'll be seeing you
around.

246
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:05,319
See ya.

247
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:18,093
He's cute.

248
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:22,063
Easy, he's one of my students.

249
00:27:22,065 --> 00:27:23,534
Just being friendly.

250
00:27:29,071 --> 00:27:30,440
Guest room is right over there.

251
00:27:32,305 --> 00:27:34,008
No incense, please.

252
00:27:49,788 --> 00:27:51,256
You need anything?

253
00:27:53,558 --> 00:27:55,027
I need a shower.

254
00:29:32,806 --> 00:29:35,342
Hey, honey, you remember the box
that wouldn't open?

255
00:29:36,511 --> 00:29:37,611
Hm.

256
00:29:39,478 --> 00:29:40,712
It opens.

257
00:29:40,714 --> 00:29:42,249
I know. I opened it.

258
00:29:42,882 --> 00:29:45,214
You did? When?

259
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:46,849
When you were at school.

260
00:29:46,851 --> 00:29:50,289
Can you please put it back in the
living room where you found it?

261
00:29:52,156 --> 00:29:53,524
I found it in the nursery.

262
00:29:55,158 --> 00:29:56,857
What? What was it doing
in there?

263
00:29:56,859 --> 00:29:59,594
I don't know. I just assumed
you put it there.

264
00:29:59,596 --> 00:30:02,399
No, I put it above the
fireplace.

265
00:30:05,268 --> 00:30:06,536
Adam, please.

266
00:30:12,374 --> 00:30:14,575
I see you guys got my
house-warming gift.

267
00:30:16,876 --> 00:30:17,743
Yep.

268
00:30:17,745 --> 00:30:20,244
Actually, it got here
before we did.

269
00:30:20,246 --> 00:30:21,545
Where'd you get it anyway?

270
00:30:21,547 --> 00:30:22,714
It's pretty cool, right?

271
00:30:22,716 --> 00:30:25,852
I actually found it at an estate
sale on my way down here.

272
00:30:26,884 --> 00:30:28,153
Lucky us.

273
00:30:29,587 --> 00:30:32,521
When do you go back to work?

274
00:30:32,523 --> 00:30:36,194
Tomorrow. I can't take anymore
time off.

275
00:30:37,827 --> 00:30:38,863
Lucky us.

276
00:31:11,823 --> 00:31:16,828
Lisa... you scared me. What are
you doing down here?

277
00:31:17,894 --> 00:31:19,893
The painting is different.

278
00:31:19,895 --> 00:31:21,829
What do you mean?

279
00:31:21,831 --> 00:31:24,698
The children are all staring
at the mother.

280
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:27,333
They weren't doing that before.

281
00:31:27,335 --> 00:31:28,804
Looks the same to me.

282
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:32,873
What are you saying?
That I'm making it up?

283
00:31:34,941 --> 00:31:37,575
No.

284
00:31:37,577 --> 00:31:39,610
I'm saying you're going through
a really difficult time...

285
00:31:39,612 --> 00:31:42,448
and maybe your mind is just
trying to sort it all out.

286
00:31:44,716 --> 00:31:46,718
I know you're gonna
be all right.

287
00:31:50,488 --> 00:31:55,289
E equals MC, squared.

288
00:31:55,291 --> 00:31:59,361
I know this isn't physics class,
but I bring this up to remind...

289
00:31:59,363 --> 00:32:01,961
you that just like matter can be
neither created nor destroyed...

290
00:32:01,963 --> 00:32:05,932
the same can be true for the
equations here in this class.

291
00:32:05,934 --> 00:32:09,701
They must equal out in the end,
and if they don't...

292
00:32:09,703 --> 00:32:12,438
then the equation was false
to begin with.

293
00:32:15,342 --> 00:32:16,611
Thank you.

294
00:32:29,521 --> 00:32:31,720
Dr. Clark, if I keep
seeing you in here...

295
00:32:31,722 --> 00:32:34,623
I'm gonna have to start
grading you.

296
00:32:34,625 --> 00:32:39,359
If you do, I warn you,
I'm pretty good at this stuff.

297
00:32:39,361 --> 00:32:43,497
And now you're teaching
Einstein, ha, ha, watch out.

298
00:32:43,499 --> 00:32:45,499
What can I do for you?

299
00:32:45,501 --> 00:32:47,667
I stopped by to offer my
condolences.

300
00:32:47,669 --> 00:32:50,736
I was sorry to hear
about your loss.

301
00:32:50,738 --> 00:32:51,807
Thank you.

302
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,040
How's your wife?

303
00:32:56,042 --> 00:33:00,412
It's been tough on her. She's
gonna get through it, though.

304
00:33:00,414 --> 00:33:01,978
That's good to hear.

305
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:05,048
As long as she's still giving
you a hard time...

306
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:08,317
about the answer to basic
equations.

307
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:11,554
More than ever. She's even
starting to believe...

308
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:12,954
in some of the same stuff
that you do.

309
00:33:12,956 --> 00:33:15,357
Ooh, that bad. Hoo-hoo.

310
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:20,527
And her sister's even worse.
She believes in everything.

311
00:33:20,529 --> 00:33:22,996
Someone who believes
in everything scares me...

312
00:33:22,998 --> 00:33:26,933
even more than somebody who
believes in nothing.

313
00:33:26,935 --> 00:33:29,336
Close your eyes.

314
00:33:29,338 --> 00:33:32,941
Breathe in. Breathe out.

315
00:33:36,444 --> 00:33:42,347
You're sitting on a beach.
It's beautiful.

316
00:33:42,349 --> 00:33:47,550
Quiet. It's very peaceful...

317
00:33:47,552 --> 00:33:50,085
It's just you.

318
00:33:50,087 --> 00:33:52,454
The sun.

319
00:33:52,456 --> 00:33:54,725
And the calming waves.

320
00:33:55,725 --> 00:33:57,861
You're very relaxed.

321
00:34:16,142 --> 00:34:18,376
Becky, can you hear that?

322
00:34:18,378 --> 00:34:19,777
Hear what?

323
00:34:19,779 --> 00:34:21,145
I'll go and check the kitchen.

324
00:34:21,147 --> 00:34:22,783
What am I looking for?

325
00:35:22,731 --> 00:35:24,567
Is there anyone up here?

326
00:36:06,202 --> 00:36:09,234
Mommy...

327
00:36:09,236 --> 00:36:13,472
Becky! There's a little girl
lying in the crib.

328
00:36:13,474 --> 00:36:14,441
What?

329
00:36:35,592 --> 00:36:37,193
There's nobody here.

330
00:36:38,694 --> 00:36:40,828
That's impossible.

331
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:46,632
She was right here. There was a
little girl lying right here!

332
00:36:46,634 --> 00:36:49,201
- I don't see anyone.
- I'm not crazy.

333
00:36:49,203 --> 00:36:50,806
What did she look like?

334
00:36:53,241 --> 00:36:55,572
She looked like this.

335
00:36:55,574 --> 00:36:58,645
Well, whoever she was, she's
gone now. We're safe.

336
00:36:59,945 --> 00:37:00,946
Are we?

337
00:37:18,261 --> 00:37:20,294
- Hey.
- Hey.

338
00:37:20,296 --> 00:37:22,263
Didn't think you'd still be up.

339
00:37:22,265 --> 00:37:24,265
Something's happening, Adam.

340
00:37:24,267 --> 00:37:25,732
What is it?

341
00:37:25,734 --> 00:37:27,099
I saw something in the
nursery again.

342
00:37:27,101 --> 00:37:30,235
There was a little girl lying
in the crib.

343
00:37:30,237 --> 00:37:31,303
Was Becky with you?

344
00:37:31,305 --> 00:37:34,640
Becky didn't see her. I saw her.

345
00:37:34,642 --> 00:37:37,144
I've been seeing and
hearing other things, too.

346
00:37:47,685 --> 00:37:50,552
Are you hearing things now?

347
00:37:50,554 --> 00:37:54,322
No, not now. I'm serious, Adam.

348
00:37:54,324 --> 00:37:55,959
I am, too.

349
00:37:58,328 --> 00:38:00,660
We'll talk to your doctor.

350
00:38:00,662 --> 00:38:03,597
And no more nursery.
I'll get rid of that crib.

351
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:05,999
It isn't the crib, Adam.

352
00:38:06,001 --> 00:38:10,235
I told you that I'd put it
together when I got home.

353
00:38:10,237 --> 00:38:12,304
If you had only waited for me...

354
00:38:12,306 --> 00:38:16,240
If I'd have waited... what?
I wouldn't have lost the baby?

355
00:38:16,242 --> 00:38:17,309
I never said that.

356
00:38:17,311 --> 00:38:18,645
It sounded like that.

357
00:38:27,618 --> 00:38:29,655
I'll be right back, Mrs. Pierce.

358
00:38:33,223 --> 00:38:34,255
How is she?

359
00:38:34,257 --> 00:38:36,123
Physically, your wife is fine.

360
00:38:36,125 --> 00:38:38,192
Emotionally, she's been through
a very traumatic experience...

361
00:38:38,194 --> 00:38:40,727
and it's going to take some
time to heal.

362
00:38:40,729 --> 00:38:42,695
Her hormones are still all over
the place...

363
00:38:42,697 --> 00:38:46,231
as her body tries to figure out
it's no longer pregnant.

364
00:38:46,233 --> 00:38:48,701
What about everything that
she's hearing and seeing?

365
00:38:48,703 --> 00:38:50,902
It's her way of going through
the grieving process.

366
00:38:50,904 --> 00:38:53,372
I prescribed her some medication
so she can relax...

367
00:38:53,374 --> 00:38:56,673
and as long as she doesn't
become a danger to herself...

368
00:38:56,675 --> 00:38:57,809
she should be okay.

369
00:38:57,811 --> 00:39:00,010
But if that changes, you bring
her right back to me.

370
00:39:00,012 --> 00:39:03,647
Of course, of course.
Thank you so much, doctor.

371
00:39:44,116 --> 00:39:47,216
I think that's the last of it.

372
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:50,251
That sounds good. It's supposed
to rain later.

373
00:39:50,253 --> 00:39:53,655
A country boy with a horse,
can't beat that.

374
00:39:53,657 --> 00:39:55,223
What can we do for you, Becky?

375
00:39:55,225 --> 00:39:57,225
You forgot the doll.

376
00:39:57,227 --> 00:39:58,359
I'll take that.

377
00:39:58,361 --> 00:40:01,361
Thanks.

378
00:40:01,363 --> 00:40:03,896
The nursery won't be bothering
your sister anymore, ma'am.

379
00:40:03,898 --> 00:40:05,765
Not with you here, it won't.

380
00:41:00,712 --> 00:41:02,015
Mommy.

381
00:41:16,326 --> 00:41:18,792
Shhhh.

382
00:41:32,872 --> 00:41:34,171
Adam, wake up.

383
00:41:34,173 --> 00:41:35,207
Lisa...

384
00:41:35,209 --> 00:41:36,408
Wake up, wake up.

385
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:37,508
Lisa...

386
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:39,175
There's someone in the house.

387
00:41:39,177 --> 00:41:40,244
What?

388
00:41:40,246 --> 00:41:41,512
She just walked down the
hallway.

389
00:41:41,514 --> 00:41:44,214
She? Was it Becky?

390
00:41:44,216 --> 00:41:45,750
No. No.

391
00:41:47,752 --> 00:41:50,188
- Stay here.
- Be careful.

392
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,709
Becky?

393
00:43:25,032 --> 00:43:27,969
What? You think you saw me
fucking your student?

394
00:43:53,858 --> 00:43:55,422
When I get home, we need
to talk...

395
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:58,294
about how long your sister's
gonna be staying.

396
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:02,062
Did you know that your
university...

397
00:44:02,064 --> 00:44:04,030
offers a degree
in parapsychology?

398
00:44:04,032 --> 00:44:07,565
Mm-hm, oh, it's not a degree,
is a certificate.

399
00:44:07,567 --> 00:44:10,268
Guy who runs it's the
Head of the Math Department.

400
00:44:10,270 --> 00:44:12,370
- Dr. Clark?
- Mm-hm.

401
00:44:12,372 --> 00:44:14,171
It says here that he's one
of the most respected...

402
00:44:14,173 --> 00:44:16,908
paranormal researchers
in the country.

403
00:44:16,910 --> 00:44:20,309
I want you to talk to him about
what's been going on here.

404
00:44:20,311 --> 00:44:21,848
What's been going on?

405
00:44:26,116 --> 00:44:27,819
What's with the poker?

406
00:44:29,888 --> 00:44:32,220
It's made of cast iron.

407
00:44:32,222 --> 00:44:35,126
Supposedly good against this
sort of thing.

408
00:44:36,658 --> 00:44:38,993
You read that in the catalog?

409
00:44:38,995 --> 00:44:41,328
I'm asking you to do this
for me.

410
00:44:41,330 --> 00:44:44,934
Will you please just
speak to him? Please.

411
00:44:50,971 --> 00:44:54,372
You know, we do get offices,
professor.

412
00:44:54,374 --> 00:44:56,407
Yes, but I find the classroom...

413
00:44:56,409 --> 00:44:58,910
to be way more conducive
to learning.

414
00:44:58,912 --> 00:45:00,213
Agreed.

415
00:45:01,545 --> 00:45:04,413
I got a message you wanted
to see me.

416
00:45:04,415 --> 00:45:07,982
I'm guessing this isn't
about a math problem.

417
00:45:07,984 --> 00:45:12,954
No, this is about your other
area of expertise.

418
00:45:12,956 --> 00:45:13,924
Ah.

419
00:45:16,458 --> 00:45:19,625
It seems that my wife has been
seeing things...

420
00:45:19,627 --> 00:45:26,532
since her miscarriage and, uh,
thanks to her sister...

421
00:45:26,534 --> 00:45:29,034
she now thinks our house
is haunted.

422
00:45:29,036 --> 00:45:32,937
Haunted? The faculty house?

423
00:45:32,939 --> 00:45:33,941
Mm-hm.

424
00:45:36,109 --> 00:45:38,008
You know, I've been here
a long time...

425
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:40,077
and I've never heard anything
like that.

426
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:43,645
It'd mean a lot if you'd come
over and talk to her anyway.

427
00:45:43,647 --> 00:45:45,982
Make her feel better.

428
00:45:45,984 --> 00:45:47,482
Let her know everything
is gonna be okay.

429
00:45:47,484 --> 00:45:49,283
You mean, I'd actually get
a chance to help...

430
00:45:49,285 --> 00:45:52,954
keep one of our math professors,
as opposed to chasing them away?

431
00:45:52,956 --> 00:45:54,021
Yes.

432
00:45:54,023 --> 00:45:55,623
How does tomorrow sound?

433
00:45:55,625 --> 00:45:56,893
Perfect.

434
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,060
Hey, Lisa, did you borrow
my make-up?

435
00:46:10,737 --> 00:46:12,539
Lisa, are you in here?

436
00:46:17,077 --> 00:46:19,344
Found your pom-poms.

437
00:46:37,326 --> 00:46:40,163
♪ Bulldogs sure are number one ♪

438
00:46:44,099 --> 00:46:45,164
What the hell?

439
00:46:57,642 --> 00:47:04,114
Becky?

440
00:47:11,088 --> 00:47:12,422
Is that you?

441
00:47:17,393 --> 00:47:18,424
Becky?

442
00:47:18,426 --> 00:47:20,227
I'm in the bathroom.

443
00:47:20,229 --> 00:47:21,794
Hey, what happened?

444
00:47:21,796 --> 00:47:24,597
Eh, just a little clumsy,
I'll be out in a minute.

445
00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:26,034
Let me in.

446
00:47:28,068 --> 00:47:30,104
Shh.

447
00:47:32,538 --> 00:47:35,073
Are you sure you're okay?

448
00:47:35,075 --> 00:47:36,340
I'm fine.

449
00:47:36,342 --> 00:47:38,742
Okay, well, call me if you
need anything.

450
00:47:38,744 --> 00:47:40,713
Thanks, I love you.

451
00:47:50,186 --> 00:47:51,421
You're fine.

452
00:48:28,618 --> 00:48:30,054
Lisa?

453
00:48:37,725 --> 00:48:38,660
What's wrong?

454
00:48:40,696 --> 00:48:44,633
Becky's gone. She didn't even
say good-bye.

455
00:48:49,268 --> 00:48:51,238
Babe, I'm so sorry.

456
00:48:55,508 --> 00:48:57,108
She always does this.

457
00:48:57,110 --> 00:49:00,143
She comes in here out
of nowhere, creates chaos...

458
00:49:00,145 --> 00:49:02,478
and then she leaves the same
way she came.

459
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:06,247
I know. I just thought this time
would be different.

460
00:49:06,249 --> 00:49:08,484
She's my sister.

461
00:49:08,486 --> 00:49:11,189
She's the only one who
understands.

462
00:49:13,389 --> 00:49:14,724
I'm here.

463
00:49:16,659 --> 00:49:20,292
And I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you.

464
00:49:20,294 --> 00:49:22,432
I'm so scared, Adam.

465
00:49:26,233 --> 00:49:30,171
I talked to Dr. Clark and he's
gonna come and see you tomorrow.

466
00:49:32,272 --> 00:49:34,272
- Yeah...
- Thank you.

467
00:49:34,274 --> 00:49:37,508
Of course, of course.

468
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:41,147
Hey... it's gonna be alright.

469
00:51:31,270 --> 00:51:32,870
You want me to get your door
for you?

470
00:51:32,872 --> 00:51:35,005
Dr. Clark, welcome.

471
00:51:35,007 --> 00:51:37,841
One plus one doesn't always
equal two and I heard...

472
00:51:37,843 --> 00:51:41,278
there's a beautiful woman living
here who agrees with me on that.

473
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,311
I like him already.

474
00:51:42,313 --> 00:51:44,346
Oh, this is going to be fun.

475
00:51:44,348 --> 00:51:46,514
Doctor, I'd like you to meet
my wife, Lisa.

476
00:51:46,516 --> 00:51:49,517
Lisa. Pleasure to meet you,
ma'am.

477
00:51:49,519 --> 00:51:51,385
I'm sorry for your loss.

478
00:51:51,387 --> 00:51:52,620
Thank you for coming.

479
00:51:52,622 --> 00:51:54,655
Hi, professor, Mrs. Pierce.

480
00:51:54,657 --> 00:51:56,690
You seem to be getting around
a lot lately.

481
00:51:56,692 --> 00:51:58,425
Well, he's not just your
student, professor...

482
00:51:58,427 --> 00:51:59,792
he's mine also.

483
00:51:59,794 --> 00:52:01,426
Well, today it's your class,
doctor.

484
00:52:01,428 --> 00:52:02,962
Alright, then.

485
00:52:02,964 --> 00:52:06,568
The university didn't give me a
house. Let's investigate yours.

486
00:52:08,668 --> 00:52:10,469
Somehow, I feel like this all...

487
00:52:10,471 --> 00:52:12,502
has to do with me losing
the baby.

488
00:52:12,504 --> 00:52:14,404
On a cellular level...

489
00:52:14,406 --> 00:52:16,707
yourself and the baby are still
connected.

490
00:52:16,709 --> 00:52:19,409
It doesn't matter whether you
miscarried or gave birth.

491
00:52:19,411 --> 00:52:21,677
In fact, there are recent
studies that show...

492
00:52:21,679 --> 00:52:23,680
that fetal cells from
a pregnancy...

493
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:25,714
they stay with the mother
for the rest of her life.

494
00:52:25,716 --> 00:52:27,449
What do the cells do?

495
00:52:27,451 --> 00:52:30,550
Well, one theory is that since
they are foreign cells...

496
00:52:30,552 --> 00:52:34,322
they do harm to the mother,
which is why women...

497
00:52:34,324 --> 00:52:38,458
have higher rates of autoimmune
diseases such as lupus.

498
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:39,826
Oh, that's comforting.

499
00:52:39,828 --> 00:52:41,861
But, there's another theory...

500
00:52:41,863 --> 00:52:44,897
one to which I personally
subscribe and that is...

501
00:52:44,899 --> 00:52:47,898
that the cells actually help
protect the mother...

502
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:49,634
by assisting in the healing
process.

503
00:52:49,636 --> 00:52:51,770
That's why women live longer.

504
00:52:51,772 --> 00:52:53,404
I like that idea much better.

505
00:52:53,406 --> 00:52:54,937
Agreed.

506
00:52:54,939 --> 00:52:59,510
Mrs. Pierce, I'm gonna be
honest with you.

507
00:52:59,512 --> 00:53:02,248
I don't think there's anything
wrong with your house.

508
00:53:03,081 --> 00:53:05,581
How can you be so sure?

509
00:53:05,583 --> 00:53:08,850
I sense things that other people
usually don't.

510
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:11,553
You can call it my gift
or my curse...

511
00:53:11,555 --> 00:53:13,454
depending on your point of view.

512
00:53:13,456 --> 00:53:17,891
So what, everything's in my
head, like hormones gone wild?

513
00:53:17,893 --> 00:53:22,962
No, don't misunderstand me.
I believe you 100%, Mrs. Pierce.

514
00:53:22,964 --> 00:53:24,530
But you just said..

515
00:53:24,532 --> 00:53:26,432
I said the house isn't the
problem...

516
00:53:26,434 --> 00:53:29,037
which means something else is.

517
00:53:29,902 --> 00:53:31,304
Then what?

518
00:53:32,806 --> 00:53:35,440
What's behind me right now?

519
00:53:35,442 --> 00:53:36,776
The fireplace.

520
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:06,831
What's this?

521
00:54:06,833 --> 00:54:09,767
That's my sister's house-warming
gift.

522
00:54:09,769 --> 00:54:12,770
A box that couldn't be opened,
until it was.

523
00:54:12,772 --> 00:54:14,674
- David.
- Yes, sir.

524
00:54:17,909 --> 00:54:19,010
Who opened it?

525
00:54:19,911 --> 00:54:20,912
I did.

526
00:54:24,013 --> 00:54:30,584
Well... I think we found
your problem.

527
00:54:30,586 --> 00:54:31,818
An empty box?

528
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:35,523
No... what was in it.

529
00:54:35,525 --> 00:54:37,123
What are you talking about?

530
00:54:37,125 --> 00:54:41,395
You said, professor, that you
were not able to open this box...

531
00:54:41,397 --> 00:54:42,495
but your wife could.

532
00:54:42,497 --> 00:54:43,629
So?

533
00:54:43,631 --> 00:54:47,766
So, I believe that when your
wife opened this box...

534
00:54:47,768 --> 00:54:52,570
it killed your baby.

535
00:54:52,572 --> 00:54:55,439
Oh, my God!

536
00:54:55,441 --> 00:54:56,906
All right, that's enough,
it's time to go.

537
00:54:56,908 --> 00:54:59,410
This is not one of our
intellectual...

538
00:54:59,412 --> 00:55:02,577
"Science versus Superstition"
debates, professor.

539
00:55:02,579 --> 00:55:03,278
No, it isn't.

540
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:05,014
- This is very real.
- Mm-hmm.

541
00:55:05,016 --> 00:55:08,183
Adam, listen to him,
he's trying to help.

542
00:55:08,185 --> 00:55:10,185
Please, Adam, hey, hey.

543
00:55:10,187 --> 00:55:14,021
I brought you here to make my
wife feel better...

544
00:55:14,023 --> 00:55:15,688
not to scare her.

545
00:55:15,690 --> 00:55:18,991
Life isn't logical or rational,
professor.

546
00:55:18,993 --> 00:55:22,895
Yourself and your wife are
in a very real danger.

547
00:55:22,897 --> 00:55:25,930
From a house-warming gift?

548
00:55:25,932 --> 00:55:28,434
You know, it's no wonder that
your department...

549
00:55:28,436 --> 00:55:31,435
has a shortage of math teachers,
because you're nuts.

550
00:55:31,437 --> 00:55:33,136
And I don't want to see you
around here anymore, either.

551
00:55:33,138 --> 00:55:36,675
My sister-in-law is gone,
so the meat market is closed.

552
00:55:37,742 --> 00:55:39,475
Why did you do that?

553
00:55:39,477 --> 00:55:42,811
Why? Because he thinks a box
caused your miscarriage.

554
00:55:42,813 --> 00:55:43,878
I believe him.

555
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:45,850
You think this is the problem?

556
00:55:55,657 --> 00:55:59,161
There, problem solved. Can I
have my wife back now?

557
00:57:39,211 --> 00:57:40,646
Ad... Adam?

558
00:58:54,673 --> 00:58:55,908
Adam?

559
00:59:06,082 --> 00:59:07,949
Are you seeing things, too?

560
00:59:07,951 --> 00:59:09,250
A girl?

561
00:59:09,252 --> 00:59:12,619
A woman. It was two of them,
actually.

562
00:59:12,621 --> 00:59:14,387
You didn't try to hurt them,
did you?

563
00:59:14,389 --> 00:59:15,658
What?

564
00:59:16,858 --> 00:59:18,626
I don't know why I said that.

565
00:59:23,930 --> 00:59:25,763
Pack your things, we're gonna
go now.

566
00:59:25,765 --> 00:59:27,131
- Where?
- Anywhere.

567
00:59:27,133 --> 00:59:29,900
You heard Dr. Clark.
It's not the house.

568
00:59:29,902 --> 00:59:31,768
We need to make things right.

569
00:59:31,770 --> 00:59:32,869
I thought you'd be happy to go.

570
00:59:32,871 --> 00:59:34,804
We can't leave.

571
00:59:50,153 --> 00:59:52,787
The Aztecs referred to it
as a fertility box...

572
00:59:52,789 --> 00:59:57,990
because only a pregnant woman
is capable of opening it.

573
00:59:57,992 --> 01:00:01,893
The box itself, it's not evil.

574
01:00:01,895 --> 01:00:04,663
It's more like a prison...

575
01:00:04,665 --> 01:00:08,233
to keep a malicious entity
trapped inside.

576
01:00:08,235 --> 01:00:10,035
So we're very fortunate,
professor...

577
01:00:10,037 --> 01:00:11,935
that when you decided to throw
it away...

578
01:00:11,937 --> 01:00:13,703
you did so from your front
porch...

579
01:00:13,705 --> 01:00:17,141
rather than the middle of the
ocean somewhere.

580
01:00:17,143 --> 01:00:21,678
And now, we have to get whatever
it is that got out, back in.

581
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:23,046
How do we do that?

582
01:00:23,048 --> 01:00:27,014
First we have to find out what
it is, what it wants.

583
01:00:27,016 --> 01:00:28,849
And why it killed my baby.

584
01:00:28,851 --> 01:00:30,653
Especially that.

585
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:35,320
I did some research.

586
01:00:35,322 --> 01:00:38,358
You see that a man named James
Harper claimed...

587
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:41,859
that a fertility box that caused
his wife Emily's miscarriage...

588
01:00:41,861 --> 01:00:44,098
just a few years back.

589
01:00:49,201 --> 01:00:50,767
I've seen her before.

590
01:00:50,769 --> 01:00:55,105
You've seen her before? When?

591
01:00:55,107 --> 01:00:57,107
The day I had my miscarriage.

592
01:00:57,109 --> 01:01:00,041
Remember that creepy woman who
scared me in the forest?

593
01:01:00,043 --> 01:01:02,945
That was her.

594
01:01:02,947 --> 01:01:05,980
Mrs. Pierce, Emily Harper is
dead.

595
01:01:05,982 --> 01:01:09,183
Her husband, James, killed her
two years ago.

596
01:01:09,185 --> 01:01:11,751
He's been in state prison
ever since.

597
01:01:11,753 --> 01:01:15,789
That's not possible.
I-I saw her, I spoke to her.

598
01:01:15,791 --> 01:01:17,790
Maybe it was somebody
that looked like her.

599
01:01:17,792 --> 01:01:20,493
No, it was her. I'm sure of it.

600
01:01:20,495 --> 01:01:24,995
Believe me, that's a day
I'll never forget.

601
01:01:24,997 --> 01:01:29,934
Mrs. Pierce, I believe
everything you've said.

602
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:33,938
Now I need you all
to believe in me.

603
01:02:00,026 --> 01:02:01,861
Okay, doctor, every room
is covered.

604
01:02:01,863 --> 01:02:03,962
All the ambiance levels have
been set.

605
01:02:03,964 --> 01:02:07,999
So if there's a sound that
doesn't belong, we'll know it.

606
01:02:08,001 --> 01:02:09,399
People would only listen more...

607
01:02:09,401 --> 01:02:13,103
they could see so much better
with their ears...

608
01:02:13,105 --> 01:02:15,538
than they ever could with
their eyes.

609
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:17,040
And we're also going to be
recording...

610
01:02:17,042 --> 01:02:19,941
on both a hard drive and mag
tape.

611
01:02:19,943 --> 01:02:21,910
Isn't mag tape a little
old school?

612
01:02:21,912 --> 01:02:26,915
The world we're trying to hear
is very old school, professor.

613
01:02:26,917 --> 01:02:28,983
Is everybody ready?

614
01:02:28,985 --> 01:02:32,823
- Yeah.
- Good, then let's begin.

615
01:03:35,106 --> 01:03:36,408
David, what's happening?

616
01:03:39,310 --> 01:03:46,447
I'm not sure, but there's something
definitely going on in the nursery.

617
01:03:46,449 --> 01:03:49,952
Playback what's recording
directly from the mag, please.

618
01:03:53,988 --> 01:04:00,025
<i>Mom, mother. Mommy, mama.</i>

619
01:04:00,027 --> 01:04:04,864
<i>Madre, mama. Madre?</i>

620
01:04:04,866 --> 01:04:06,530
Who's saying that?

621
01:04:06,532 --> 01:04:13,069
<i>Mom, mother. Mommy, mama.</i>

622
01:04:13,071 --> 01:04:17,272
<i>Madre, mama. Madre.</i>

623
01:04:17,274 --> 01:04:19,341
Record again, David.

624
01:04:19,343 --> 01:04:21,213
There's somebody up there.

625
01:04:23,212 --> 01:04:24,815
What does it want?

626
01:04:32,088 --> 01:04:33,453
Stop.

627
01:04:33,455 --> 01:04:36,391
Rewind and playback
just what happened.

628
01:04:41,361 --> 01:04:43,661
<i>What does it want?</i>

629
01:04:43,663 --> 01:04:47,333
<i>Life. Death.</i>

630
01:04:48,166 --> 01:04:51,103
David, record.

631
01:04:54,672 --> 01:04:56,209
Who are you?

632
01:05:00,278 --> 01:05:04,149
Stop. Rewind.

633
01:05:06,082 --> 01:05:09,118
Stop. Playback.

634
01:05:10,587 --> 01:05:12,586
<i>Who are you?</i>

635
01:05:12,588 --> 01:05:15,289
<i>Lisa... Jr.</i>

636
01:05:27,434 --> 01:05:30,034
I take it we're all
in the dark now.

637
01:05:30,036 --> 01:05:31,538
- Mm-hm.
- Yeah.

638
01:05:32,637 --> 01:05:33,603
That was fast.

639
01:05:33,605 --> 01:05:37,372
Doctor, why did it say its name
was Lisa Jr.?

640
01:05:37,374 --> 01:05:39,609
I was hoping you could tell me
that.

641
01:05:39,611 --> 01:05:42,046
That's what I used to call
my baby.

642
01:05:47,317 --> 01:05:50,320
David, start recording.

643
01:05:53,655 --> 01:05:56,021
And playback directly
from the mag.

644
01:05:56,023 --> 01:06:00,692
<i>Mom, mother. Mommy, mama.</i>

645
01:06:00,694 --> 01:06:02,393
No! No.

646
01:06:02,395 --> 01:06:04,029
<i>Mama...</i>

647
01:06:04,031 --> 01:06:06,633
David, switch off playback,
keep recording.

648
01:06:08,601 --> 01:06:14,406
Lisa Jr., you got out of your
box. How do I get you back in?

649
01:06:16,208 --> 01:06:17,209
You don't.

650
01:06:23,547 --> 01:06:26,081
- She's gone!
- Who was that?

651
01:06:26,083 --> 01:06:28,583
That's-that's the girl.
That's the little girl.

652
01:07:32,771 --> 01:07:34,440
Mrs. Pierce...

653
01:07:54,456 --> 01:07:57,159
<i>I see you.</i>

654
01:08:01,761 --> 01:08:03,795
I see you, too.

655
01:08:03,797 --> 01:08:07,231
Doctor Clark, are you okay?
Hey.

656
01:08:07,233 --> 01:08:08,399
I think so. Yeah.

657
01:08:08,401 --> 01:08:11,067
We weren't sure
there for a moment.

658
01:08:11,069 --> 01:08:13,302
- Who did you see?
- What?

659
01:08:13,304 --> 01:08:15,140
You said, "I see you."

660
01:08:16,674 --> 01:08:18,443
The entity.

661
01:08:19,811 --> 01:08:22,776
It killed your unborn
daughter...

662
01:08:22,778 --> 01:08:25,480
possessed her spirit
and then took her place.

663
01:08:25,482 --> 01:08:29,118
How do we get rid of it? How do
we get it back in the box?

664
01:08:32,254 --> 01:08:36,422
I don't know. But I know
it's getting stronger.

665
01:08:36,424 --> 01:08:38,658
I need to get him to a hospital.

666
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:40,325
You two just get out of here.
Go somewhere safe.

667
01:08:40,327 --> 01:08:43,131
No, no, no, there is no
safe place.

668
01:08:44,431 --> 01:08:47,564
Mrs. Pierce, this thing
is connected to you.

669
01:08:47,566 --> 01:08:49,232
It is a part of you.

670
01:08:49,234 --> 01:08:52,135
There's no place that you can go
it will not follow.

671
01:08:52,137 --> 01:08:54,838
There has to be something
that we can do.

672
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:57,574
James and Emily Harper got it
back in the box.

673
01:08:57,576 --> 01:08:59,274
How did they do it?

674
01:08:59,276 --> 01:09:00,778
I don't know.

675
01:09:02,612 --> 01:09:04,778
And Emily Harper's dead.

676
01:09:04,780 --> 01:09:09,350
Well, then we're just going
to have to ask James.

677
01:09:23,196 --> 01:09:27,635
I haven't had many visitors
since I killed my wife.

678
01:09:29,567 --> 01:09:31,804
So who are you again?

679
01:09:33,839 --> 01:09:39,278
I met your wife, Emily,
out in the forest, recently.

680
01:09:40,777 --> 01:09:42,413
Really?

681
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:46,780
People think that I'm crazy?

682
01:09:46,782 --> 01:09:49,553
I was pregnant
and she threatened me.

683
01:09:53,888 --> 01:09:58,689
Obviously, I think we all know
that...

684
01:09:58,691 --> 01:10:01,393
it couldn't have been Emily.

685
01:10:01,395 --> 01:10:03,731
We found your fertility box.

686
01:10:07,333 --> 01:10:09,666
Where?

687
01:10:09,668 --> 01:10:12,936
Apparently, when someone
kills their wife...

688
01:10:12,938 --> 01:10:16,442
their landlord has an estate
sale.

689
01:10:18,308 --> 01:10:19,543
Did you open it?

690
01:10:20,411 --> 01:10:21,580
Yeah.

691
01:10:26,383 --> 01:10:28,814
Who have you seen so far?

692
01:10:28,816 --> 01:10:34,520
I've seen a baby, a little girl,
and a teenager and...

693
01:10:34,522 --> 01:10:40,259
I've seen a young woman,
and an old woman.

694
01:10:40,261 --> 01:10:45,563
As I'm sure you already know,
it kills unborn babies...

695
01:10:45,565 --> 01:10:49,469
possesses who they were going
to be.

696
01:10:52,338 --> 01:10:54,938
Has it made physical contact?

697
01:10:54,940 --> 01:10:59,177
Yeah. It kissed me
in the shower.

698
01:11:03,413 --> 01:11:10,383
You made out with your own
possessed ghost daughter?

699
01:11:11,752 --> 01:11:13,787
I mean, I may have killed
my wife...

700
01:11:13,789 --> 01:11:17,389
but that is some twisted shit.

701
01:11:19,259 --> 01:11:24,662
I'm glad you find this all
amusing. What does it mean?

702
01:11:24,664 --> 01:11:27,431
It means that you're almost
out of time.

703
01:11:27,433 --> 01:11:31,768
When it's young, only the mother
can see it.

704
01:11:31,770 --> 01:11:37,807
But as it gets older,
it gets stronger.

705
01:11:37,809 --> 01:11:41,575
Pretty soon, it won't be kissing
you, it'll be killing you...

706
01:11:41,577 --> 01:11:46,413
and everyone else, until there
is no one else.

707
01:11:46,415 --> 01:11:48,549
You stopped it somehow.
How did you do it?

708
01:11:48,551 --> 01:11:53,518
You're the one that needs to be
stopped, before you start...

709
01:11:53,520 --> 01:12:00,525
loving it, and protecting it,
as if it was your own child.

710
01:12:00,527 --> 01:12:02,828
You're not well anymore.

711
01:12:02,830 --> 01:12:04,895
How do we get it back
in the box, James?

712
01:12:04,897 --> 01:12:09,603
Look around you. Isn't it
obvious?

713
01:12:12,004 --> 01:12:13,302
I killed my wife.

714
01:12:13,304 --> 01:12:15,971
I don't understand.

715
01:12:15,973 --> 01:12:20,376
You're its-its mother. It's
connected to you.

716
01:12:20,378 --> 01:12:23,945
But it, it goes both ways.

717
01:12:23,947 --> 01:12:27,982
It can't hurt you, but you
can hurt it.

718
01:12:27,984 --> 01:12:31,854
When you die, it's got nowhere
to go, but back in the box.

719
01:12:33,354 --> 01:12:34,854
No, there's gotta be
another way.

720
01:12:34,856 --> 01:12:36,521
There's gotta be another way.

721
01:12:36,523 --> 01:12:42,529
I wake up every morning wishing
that there was another way.

722
01:12:44,731 --> 01:12:51,701
Kill your wife, everyone lives.
Don't, everyone dies.

723
01:12:56,741 --> 01:12:58,809
We're gonna figure this out.

724
01:13:02,713 --> 01:13:04,478
Every problem has a solution...

725
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:06,346
or the equation is false
to begin with.

726
01:13:06,348 --> 01:13:07,914
He gave you the solution,
you just didn't like it.

727
01:13:07,916 --> 01:13:10,649
One answer is not the only
answer.

728
01:13:10,651 --> 01:13:12,852
He's right. I'm not well.

729
01:13:12,854 --> 01:13:14,621
What are you talking about?

730
01:13:14,623 --> 01:13:17,556
He's a crazy man that killed
his wife.

731
01:13:17,558 --> 01:13:21,829
What if I started loving Lisa
Jr. and wanted to protect her?

732
01:13:23,729 --> 01:13:24,628
Would you kill me?

733
01:13:24,630 --> 01:13:26,931
Of course, I wouldn't.

734
01:13:26,933 --> 01:13:29,966
Because this not a "her",
it is an "it".

735
01:13:29,968 --> 01:13:34,337
An evil "it" that killed our
baby, and now wants to kill us.

736
01:13:34,339 --> 01:13:38,940
No, not us. You, she wants
to kill you.

737
01:13:38,942 --> 01:13:41,509
You're starting to scare me.

738
01:13:41,511 --> 01:13:44,512
Yeah, that's what Emily said out
in the forest that day.

739
01:13:44,514 --> 01:13:47,080
She said that pretty soon,
everybody would be scared of me.

740
01:13:47,082 --> 01:13:51,552
Tell me, Adam, can one plus one
equal anything other than two?

741
01:13:51,554 --> 01:13:54,520
You taught me that it could.

742
01:13:54,522 --> 01:13:57,522
Let's just keep going...
and don't look back.

743
01:13:57,524 --> 01:14:02,627
Let's go back to the city.
Go back to our apartment.

744
01:14:02,629 --> 01:14:03,561
Hell, we could go anywhere.

745
01:14:03,563 --> 01:14:06,630
You heard what Dr. Clark said.

746
01:14:06,632 --> 01:14:10,799
She's a part of me now. She'll
follow me where ever we go.

747
01:14:10,801 --> 01:14:12,771
I don't see her anywhere now.

748
01:14:13,537 --> 01:14:14,571
I do.

749
01:14:39,426 --> 01:14:40,694
Lisa?

750
01:14:43,630 --> 01:14:45,032
Lisa!

751
01:15:10,618 --> 01:15:12,755
Lisa, are you in here?

752
01:15:19,093 --> 01:15:20,662
David?

753
01:16:21,177 --> 01:16:24,745
<i>Lisa
Jr., you got out of your box.</i>

754
01:16:24,747 --> 01:16:27,915
<i>How do I put you back in?</i>

755
01:16:27,917 --> 01:16:29,886
<i>You don't.</i>

756
01:16:36,723 --> 01:16:38,526
What are you doing here?

757
01:16:40,193 --> 01:16:43,994
You gave us that box.
You're gonna answer for that.

758
01:16:43,996 --> 01:16:48,568
I didn't know what it was.
I still don't.

759
01:16:49,235 --> 01:16:50,733
Where's Lisa?

760
01:16:50,735 --> 01:16:52,438
Upstairs.

761
01:16:53,671 --> 01:16:55,674
I'll deal with you later.

762
01:17:00,978 --> 01:17:03,181
You'll deal with me now!

763
01:17:11,151 --> 01:17:13,685
Was it good for you, Daddy?

764
01:17:13,687 --> 01:17:16,925
You weren't supposed to tell
Mommy about us.

765
01:17:36,807 --> 01:17:38,043
Lisa!

766
01:17:40,810 --> 01:17:42,245
Lisa!

767
01:20:20,244 --> 01:20:22,809
Lisa, what happened?

768
01:20:22,811 --> 01:20:26,149
I know why I saw Emily Harper
out in the forest that day.

769
01:20:28,015 --> 01:20:31,383
A part of her was trapped in the
box, and when I opened it...

770
01:20:31,385 --> 01:20:34,989
she tried to warn me...
about everything.

771
01:20:39,059 --> 01:20:41,027
They're all looking at us.

772
01:20:42,928 --> 01:20:44,996
Do you believe me now?

773
01:20:44,998 --> 01:20:46,132
Yeah.

774
01:20:48,367 --> 01:20:51,468
And do you believe we're gonna
live happily ever after?

775
01:20:51,470 --> 01:20:54,773
We're gonna find a way to stop
this, I promise you.

776
01:20:55,972 --> 01:20:58,274
You said I was gonna be
a great mom.

777
01:20:59,809 --> 01:21:01,275
The best.

778
01:21:01,277 --> 01:21:04,011
You remember the reasons
you told me?

779
01:21:04,013 --> 01:21:11,083
'Cause you're loving, and kind,
and loyal, and nurturing.

780
01:21:11,085 --> 01:21:14,086
And protective.

781
01:21:14,088 --> 01:21:19,924
She's my daughter. I have to
take care of her and love her.

782
01:21:19,926 --> 01:21:21,058
And protect her.

783
01:21:21,060 --> 01:21:22,727
It's not Lisa Jr.

784
01:21:22,729 --> 01:21:25,029
You're just jealous, because you
wanted a boy.

785
01:21:25,031 --> 01:21:27,997
You wanted an Adam Jr and you're
taking it out on our daughter.

786
01:21:27,999 --> 01:21:30,499
No, darlin', our baby's dead,
and something...

787
01:21:30,501 --> 01:21:36,070
something terrible took its
place. But we can beat it.

788
01:21:36,072 --> 01:21:36,971
By killing me?

789
01:21:36,973 --> 01:21:38,006
No.

790
01:21:38,008 --> 01:21:41,142
I won't let you hurt her.

791
01:21:41,144 --> 01:21:44,144
I won't let you hurt me.

792
01:22:44,163 --> 01:22:49,966
Look behind you.

793
01:23:26,164 --> 01:23:29,832
Daddy, are you trying
to kill Mommy?

794
01:23:34,070 --> 01:23:36,205
Lisa...

795
01:23:36,207 --> 01:23:38,139
Adam.

796
01:23:38,141 --> 01:23:39,106
No.

797
01:23:39,108 --> 01:23:41,141
I'm so sorry...

798
01:23:41,143 --> 01:23:44,078
I didn't... I didn't know it was
you. I didn't mean to...

799
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:45,878
I know, it's okay.

800
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:48,247
I'm going to get you out
of here. Come on.

801
01:23:48,249 --> 01:23:51,386
No, you have to finish this.

802
01:23:59,091 --> 01:24:01,228
...before it's too late.

803
01:24:07,599 --> 01:24:09,132
I'm not giving up on you.

804
01:24:09,134 --> 01:24:13,138
Please... do it for our real
daughter.

805
01:24:26,615 --> 01:24:29,214
I love you.

806
01:24:29,216 --> 01:24:31,483
I love you, too, professor.

807
01:24:31,485 --> 01:24:34,119
Don't do it, Daddy.

808
01:24:34,121 --> 01:24:36,391
Oh, God, forgive me.

809
01:25:18,992 --> 01:25:22,459
Dr. Clark, surprised to see
you here.

810
01:25:22,461 --> 01:25:24,227
Why's that?

811
01:25:24,229 --> 01:25:27,530
Because when I was sitting
exactly where you are now...

812
01:25:27,532 --> 01:25:29,966
James told me that nobody came
to visit him...

813
01:25:29,968 --> 01:25:34,168
after he killed his wife,
everyone thought he went crazy.

814
01:25:34,170 --> 01:25:35,369
Didn't he?

815
01:25:35,371 --> 01:25:37,706
Didn't I?

816
01:25:37,708 --> 01:25:39,440
They say that I killed Lisa...

817
01:25:39,442 --> 01:25:42,279
because I found her sleeping
with one of my students.

818
01:25:43,479 --> 01:25:45,513
They say I killed David.

819
01:25:45,515 --> 01:25:50,683
That would be a logical
and rational conclusion.

820
01:25:50,685 --> 01:25:53,985
You know, I tried talking
to the police, but even...

821
01:25:53,987 --> 01:25:56,187
in the country, superstition
is something that only...

822
01:25:56,189 --> 01:25:58,221
happens behind closed doors.

823
01:25:58,223 --> 01:26:00,224
You and I both know the truth.

824
01:26:00,226 --> 01:26:05,265
I know "a truth", but "the
truth"?

825
01:26:07,566 --> 01:26:12,434
Adam... why did you kill Lisa?

826
01:26:12,436 --> 01:26:15,304
Is it because James Harper
told you to?

827
01:26:15,306 --> 01:26:17,271
Mm-mm.

828
01:26:17,273 --> 01:26:22,543
It was the only way to save
her... and our little baby.

829
01:26:22,545 --> 01:26:25,611
And you really believe that?

830
01:26:25,613 --> 01:26:28,314
A wise person once said that
one plus one...

831
01:26:28,316 --> 01:26:29,518
doesn't always equal two.

832
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:39,590
What, what happened to the box,
Adam?

833
01:26:39,592 --> 01:26:43,995
The police couldn't find it, not
that they were looking for it.

834
01:26:43,997 --> 01:26:46,198
But we couldn't find it, either.

835
01:26:47,366 --> 01:26:50,766
I took care of it.

836
01:26:50,768 --> 01:26:53,504
I sent it back to where
it came from.

837
01:27:48,469 --> 01:27:53,469
