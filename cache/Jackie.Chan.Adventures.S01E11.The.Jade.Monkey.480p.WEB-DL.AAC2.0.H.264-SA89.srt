1
00:00:03,203 --> 00:00:05,437
I know you're all excited
about career day,

2
00:00:05,439 --> 00:00:07,039
but your parents
won't be arriving

3
00:00:07,041 --> 00:00:08,807
until last period.

4
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:10,009
Hey, Jade,

5
00:00:10,011 --> 00:00:12,411
is your uncle Jackie
gonna wow the class

6
00:00:12,413 --> 00:00:15,781
about the "secret agent"
business?

7
00:00:15,783 --> 00:00:17,016
You bet, drew,

8
00:00:17,018 --> 00:00:18,183
and the truth
is gonna

9
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:20,386
blow...Your...Mind.

10
00:00:20,388 --> 00:00:22,488
Oh, oh, you mean the "truth"

11
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:25,024
about ninjas, magic talismans,

12
00:00:25,026 --> 00:00:27,893
that 400-pound giant
named tofu?

13
00:00:27,895 --> 00:00:28,994
His name is...

14
00:00:28,996 --> 00:00:30,062
(Thundering footsteps)

15
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:32,898
Tohru.

16
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:36,035
(Muttering)
(Muttering)

17
00:00:36,037 --> 00:00:38,037
Jackie.
Uncle.

18
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:41,206
Jade, hand over
the talismans...

19
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,909
Or we chop down
your family tree.

20
00:00:43,911 --> 00:00:46,512
You guys are the ones
going down.

21
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:50,682
Hyah!

22
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,553
Hyah!

23
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,324
I'm sorry
- I doubted you, Jade.

24
00:00:59,326 --> 00:01:02,261
No homework for
the rest of the year!

25
00:01:02,263 --> 00:01:03,929
Yes! Go, Jade.

26
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:05,764
Yeah, no homework.

27
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:06,832
Jade...

28
00:01:06,834 --> 00:01:09,101
Jade...

29
00:01:09,103 --> 00:01:11,070
Jade!

30
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:14,306
If you're done daydreaming,

31
00:01:14,308 --> 00:01:17,409
can you tell us
the capital of Italy?

32
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:19,912
Uh, pizza?

33
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:21,947
Heh heh.

34
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:12,965
So, with the kitten
under one arm,

35
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:14,433
and the orphan
under the other,

36
00:02:14,435 --> 00:02:16,668
I leapt out of
the second-story window.

37
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:17,970
Yeah, I saved
a few lives,

38
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:19,838
but when you're
a firefighter,

39
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,306
that's all in a day's work.

40
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:22,741
Thanks for listening, kids.

41
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:23,809
All right!

42
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:25,544
(Cheering)

43
00:02:25,546 --> 00:02:27,546
All right, dad.

44
00:02:27,548 --> 00:02:29,047
Pretty cool, drew.

45
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:32,317
But wait till you get
a load of Jackie.

46
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,952
To uncover artifacts,

47
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:35,721
the patient archeologist

48
00:02:35,723 --> 00:02:37,022
digs in the dirt

49
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:39,625
with little, tiny brushes,

50
00:02:39,627 --> 00:02:41,593
bring very careful

51
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:43,595
not to damage anything.

52
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:45,164
Sometimes it can take

53
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:47,699
hours or even days.

54
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:51,436
So much for
secret agent man.

55
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:54,206
Uh...Question?

56
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:55,908
Jackie, tell us
about the time

57
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,409
you whomped a bunch
of shadowkahn

58
00:02:57,411 --> 00:02:59,244
on the roller coaster
at melvinworld.

59
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:03,815
Heh. That's a bit
off topic, Jade.

60
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:07,252
Now, once an artifact
is unearthed--

61
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:08,987
really! He tanned
their ninja hides.

62
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:12,090
He's got amazing
reflexes. Watch.

63
00:03:12,092 --> 00:03:14,026
Ow! Jade...

64
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:15,994
Jade has quite
an imagination,

65
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:18,297
doesn't she,
Mr. chan?

66
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:21,033
Heh. Yes, she does.

67
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:23,869
And a good
throwing arm, too.

68
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:25,404
(All talking at once)

69
00:03:25,406 --> 00:03:27,439
Thanks, Jackie.

70
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:29,541
You made me look like
a big, fat liar.

71
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:32,244
Jade, my work
with section 13

72
00:03:32,246 --> 00:03:34,112
is a secret, remember?

73
00:03:34,114 --> 00:03:36,048
Besides, this is career day,

74
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,317
and my career is archeology.

75
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,018
Next time you go on a mission,

76
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,887
I'm bringing back proof.

77
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:43,188
What next time?

78
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:46,124
You're not supposed
to go on assignment
with me, Jade.

79
00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:47,726
And don't forget,
children--

80
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,161
next week, it's your turn

81
00:03:49,163 --> 00:03:51,029
to report on
your parents' job,

82
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:53,799
after you
accompany them to work.

83
00:03:58,438 --> 00:03:59,671
Jackie: Captain black

84
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:01,106
has pinpointed the location

85
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:02,274
of another talisman

86
00:04:02,276 --> 00:04:04,176
in Micronesia.

87
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:20,058
Whoa.

88
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,660
You think archeology

89
00:04:21,662 --> 00:04:23,061
is a snore?

90
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:27,599
We'll start here.

91
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:28,767
Remember, Jade--

92
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:31,203
archeology requires Patience.

93
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:45,684
Ooh...

94
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,022
Oh, Jackie...

95
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:53,625
You gotta be kidding me.

96
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:57,496
It's the monkey talisman.

97
00:04:57,498 --> 00:04:59,231
Must be a sea monkey.

98
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:02,000
The dark hand.

99
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:03,502
Go, go, go!

100
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,284
Get back up to the boat.

101
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,427
Aaahhh!

102
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:48,814
Unh. Unh. Aaahh!

103
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:57,122
(Panting)

104
00:05:58,057 --> 00:05:59,191
(Gasps)

105
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:01,760
The talisman.

106
00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:02,894
Ah...

107
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:07,032
Hand over the rock, flipper.

108
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,236
Hey.

109
00:06:11,238 --> 00:06:13,538
(Grunting)

110
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:21,980
Uh, you guys are going down.

111
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:30,856
Stop.

112
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:35,360
Why are we
listening to him?

113
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:42,701
Yaaahhh!

114
00:06:42,703 --> 00:06:44,903
(Grunts)

115
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:47,272
Whoa.

116
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:49,174
Get off of me, ratso.

117
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:56,715
Rrrrr....

118
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:04,723
Jackie!

119
00:07:04,725 --> 00:07:07,225
Monkey magic better be good.

120
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:11,329
Come on, activate already.

121
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:15,300
Uhh...Before
this boat ride

122
00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:17,169
makes me yack.

123
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:25,744
Whoa. Not what I meant.

124
00:07:25,746 --> 00:07:26,878
What just
happened here?

125
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,079
Chan's a horse.

126
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:29,681
No, chan's a yak.

127
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:31,082
The talisman.

128
00:07:31,084 --> 00:07:34,119
Uh, yakkie, er, Jackie?

129
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:37,989
Uh, change him back.

130
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:43,128
This must be the "turn stuff
into other stuff" talisman.

131
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,796
I noticed.

132
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,865
So how about
I turn tohru into--

133
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,068
(all scream)

134
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,047
(Jade groans)

135
00:08:02,049 --> 00:08:03,148
Ohh...

136
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,716
(Screeches)

137
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,651
Ewww!

138
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:09,454
Hello. Mouthwash?

139
00:08:09,456 --> 00:08:11,089
Who are you?

140
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:13,358
Where am I?

141
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,095
Ah...I'm shipwrecked.

142
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:20,298
My report is gonna rock.

143
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:22,634
Say "cheese."

144
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:24,236
(Screeches)

145
00:08:24,238 --> 00:08:25,403
Hey, monkey boy,

146
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:27,305
that's not for you,

147
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:29,975
even if it does have
your picture on it.

148
00:08:29,977 --> 00:08:33,211
Oh, no. Jackie.

149
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:35,280
(All groan)

150
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:37,849
Ahh...

151
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,985
Tohru, hiya.

152
00:08:39,987 --> 00:08:42,254
Yeah, hiya.
Hiya.

153
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,391
We must find
the talisman.

154
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:49,461
How do we know chan and
the girl aren't still at sea?

155
00:08:49,463 --> 00:08:50,996
Jade: Jackie!

156
00:08:50,998 --> 00:08:52,931
Oh, Jackie!

157
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:56,067
Jackie!

158
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:58,136
There she is.

159
00:08:58,138 --> 00:08:59,571
(Gasps)

160
00:08:59,573 --> 00:09:00,639
Jackie.

161
00:09:00,641 --> 00:09:02,507
Jackie!

162
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,012
Ohh...

163
00:09:07,014 --> 00:09:08,813
Jackie...

164
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:11,650
Jackie...

165
00:09:11,652 --> 00:09:15,420
Jackie, you are shipwrecked.

166
00:09:15,422 --> 00:09:18,456
Yes, uncle, shipwrecked.

167
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:19,858
One more thing--

168
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,894
Jade has
the monkey talisman.

169
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:25,196
Jade's a good girl.

170
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:26,898
One more thing--

171
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,234
bad men are chasing her.

172
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:32,270
She needs your help.

173
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:33,905
Now!
Ow.

174
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,507
Jackie!

175
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:37,042
Jade.

176
00:09:37,044 --> 00:09:39,077
(Panting)

177
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:46,051
Duh, the "turn things into
other things" talisman.

178
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:50,922
Turn this log
into a death ray.

179
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:53,425
Waah! That's a manta ray.

180
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:56,494
Change it back!
Change it back!

181
00:09:56,496 --> 00:09:59,297
(Pants) Guess it
only does animals.

182
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,067
In that case,

183
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:04,936
how about I get
these rats off my tail?

184
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:09,774
Ratso?

185
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,010
(Squeaks)

186
00:10:12,012 --> 00:10:13,278
Whoa.

187
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:18,850
The talisman.
Huh? Right?

188
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:22,020
(Panting) Aardvark.
Hippo. Giraffe.

189
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:27,792
(Thud)

190
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,661
(Panting)

191
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:32,864
Gotta hide. Gotta hide.

192
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:35,233
Double duh.

193
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:37,302
Make a monkey out of me.

194
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,773
(Screeches)

195
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,042
Where'd she go?

196
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:45,744
This way, I think.

197
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:48,346
Whew, close call.

198
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:51,583
Ok, change me back.

199
00:10:51,585 --> 00:10:53,985
(Screeches)

200
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,053
Not good.

201
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:57,122
(Animal growls)

202
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:00,525
Way not good.

203
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:02,894
Aaaaaahhhhhh!

204
00:11:02,896 --> 00:11:03,995
(Snorts)

205
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,864
Hello, Jade.

206
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:06,998
You're a monkey.

207
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:10,468
Nyah-nyah.

208
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:12,470
Aah!

209
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:14,105
(Hisses)

210
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:16,141
Hey, I don't get it.

211
00:11:16,143 --> 00:11:18,109
She just disappeared.

212
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:20,945
(Screeches)

213
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:26,418
Yo, talisman
at 9:00.

214
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,086
A monkey's got it.

215
00:11:28,088 --> 00:11:29,387
Grab the chimp.

216
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:31,389
Hey, Mr. muggs.

217
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:33,958
I've gotta get
that talisman back,

218
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,760
wherever it is.

219
00:11:35,762 --> 00:11:36,928
Jackie: Jade!

220
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,396
Jackie.

221
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:40,231
Jade.

222
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:42,901
Jade!

223
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:44,202
Jade!

224
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:45,837
A giraffe?

225
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:49,541
We drifted
all the way to Africa?

226
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:51,242
(Gasps)

227
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:54,679
Jade.

228
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,616
Tohru.

229
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:04,155
(Screeches)

230
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:05,323
Aah! Aah!

231
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:08,259
Jackie, those dark hand
guys were after me,

232
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:10,061
so I turned myself
into a monkey,

233
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,730
and then this other monkey
took the talisman.

234
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:13,998
(Screeches)

235
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,335
Shoo. Go away.

236
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:20,605
Duh. Monkeys
don't speak English.

237
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,375
Ok, first word--

238
00:12:24,377 --> 00:12:25,710
sounds like...

239
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:30,648
Maid.

240
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,554
Uh, you seem like

241
00:12:36,556 --> 00:12:38,490
a very nice monkey,

242
00:12:38,492 --> 00:12:41,493
but I have to find my niece.

243
00:12:41,495 --> 00:12:43,161
Wait. Don't go.

244
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:45,163
(Screeches)

245
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:52,537
I'm not going to take
your picture.

246
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:55,240
Yes.

247
00:12:55,242 --> 00:12:58,843
(Screeches) Me!

248
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:01,846
Jade? You...

249
00:13:01,848 --> 00:13:03,648
You know where Jade is?

250
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:12,123
Oh, an arrow.

251
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,292
Oh, thank you,

252
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:15,693
little monkey.

253
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:18,129
No.

254
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,397
(Screeches angrily)

255
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,835
Hey! Put me down.

256
00:13:23,837 --> 00:13:24,903
Jackie!

257
00:13:24,905 --> 00:13:26,538
(Screeches)

258
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,373
Jackie!

259
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:35,880
(Screeching)

260
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:38,850
Let me go. Let me go.

261
00:13:38,852 --> 00:13:42,253
Hey, whoa. What are
you doing? Eww!

262
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:45,356
Eww! Check, please.

263
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:48,459
(Screams)

264
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:53,064
Guess that means
"bye-bye" in monkey.

265
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:58,369
Heh. Guess not.

266
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:02,740
Oh...This is the last time

267
00:14:02,742 --> 00:14:04,909
I follow directions
from a monkey.

268
00:14:04,911 --> 00:14:06,010
Don't move.

269
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:08,847
Stay right there.

270
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:10,515
That's it, bonzo.

271
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:11,883
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

272
00:14:11,885 --> 00:14:13,785
(Screeches)

273
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,921
Hyah! Stop.

274
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:19,424
The monkey.

275
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:22,227
Gaah.
Where is Jade?

276
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:29,634
(Squeaks)

277
00:14:29,636 --> 00:14:30,768
Ratso.

278
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,503
That's ratso?

279
00:14:32,505 --> 00:14:35,707
(Squeaks)

280
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:37,508
Tell me what you've
done with Jade,

281
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:38,743
or ratso gets it.

282
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:40,678
Ohh, calm down, dude.

283
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,780
We were chasing her,
that's all.

284
00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:43,915
The kid zapped ratso,

285
00:14:43,917 --> 00:14:45,283
and the next thing we know,

286
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:46,985
that monkey
had the talisman.

287
00:14:46,987 --> 00:14:49,187
Jade turned ratso into a rat

288
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:51,389
and herself into a monkey?

289
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,324
I'm a monkey's uncle.

290
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:55,493
Jade!

291
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:58,630
The girl's the monkey
with the talisman? Whoa.

292
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:03,701
(Squeaks)

293
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:06,037
(Screeches)

294
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:10,808
Aah! Gaah! Unh.

295
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:13,144
(Screeches)

296
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:15,647
Hmm. (Grunting)

297
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:18,683
Jade!

298
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:25,156
Oh, Jade.

299
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:26,324
Here, Jade.

300
00:15:26,326 --> 00:15:28,559
It's me. Jackie.

301
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,197
Ach, Jade.

302
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:39,437
Yo, Tarzan.

303
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,173
Unh. J--

304
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:44,876
Jade, quit
fooling around.

305
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:48,579
Stop it.

306
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:52,250
I don't need a bath.

307
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,722
(Screeches)

308
00:15:57,724 --> 00:15:59,691
Later, mom.

309
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,827
Jade.

310
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,396
(Screeches)

311
00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:06,564
Sorry, Jade.

312
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:08,433
This is for your own good.

313
00:16:08,435 --> 00:16:11,436
Change her back.

314
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:15,740
Jade, did you break
the talisman?

315
00:16:15,742 --> 00:16:17,742
Hand over the rock.

316
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,682
Here goes nothing.

317
00:16:24,684 --> 00:16:25,850
Ooh.

318
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:29,620
Hey there.

319
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:32,824
Talisman works just fine.

320
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:38,162
Ratso: I say we turn him
into a dog. I like dogs.

321
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:40,631
Why would you wanna turn him
into something you like?

322
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:41,799
A cat, then.

323
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:43,568
Ah, cats are too snooty.

324
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:44,936
How about a cockroach?

325
00:16:44,938 --> 00:16:46,270
We can stomp him.

326
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:47,338
An emu.

327
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,374
Yeah. What's an emu?

328
00:16:49,376 --> 00:16:51,809
Don't know.
Sounds good.

329
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:53,911
Perhaps an animal
we can eat.

330
00:16:53,913 --> 00:16:57,081
Hmm...Chicken
a la chan.

331
00:16:57,083 --> 00:17:00,585
No! That would make you
cannibals.

332
00:17:00,587 --> 00:17:04,222
(Angry screeching)

333
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:07,625
Change me back.

334
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,428
Hi, Jackie.

335
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,931
Jade. Then who are you?

336
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:15,433
(Belches)

337
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,573
The talisman.

338
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:24,642
Elephant.

339
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,948
Aah, Jade! Bad move,
bad move, bad move.

340
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,450
Uh, got it covered.

341
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:33,785
Once a rat...

342
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:37,588
(Squeaks)

343
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:41,726
Jackie.
Change him back.

344
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:49,033
Hey, gimme, gimme, gimme.

345
00:17:49,035 --> 00:17:50,268
Gaah!

346
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,702
You're a flamingo.

347
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:58,076
Kangaroo.

348
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,513
Huh?

349
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,459
Good choice.

350
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:16,627
Change me back.

351
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:18,262
Jack--
rabbit.

352
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,167
Unh.

353
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:28,873
(All grumble)

354
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:40,952
(Screeches)

355
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:49,260
Change me back.

356
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:53,131
Hope this means
what I think it means.

357
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:55,967
Aaaahhhh!

358
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:59,937
Aaaahhhh!

359
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:06,344
(Angry screeching)

360
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:10,348
Hey, cut that out.

361
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:20,791
(Screeching)

362
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:24,162
(Sniffing)

363
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:25,830
Ooh-ooh.

364
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:27,331
Hi, mom.

365
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,566
Mom?

366
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:32,336
Welcome to the family.

367
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:40,411
Ms. hardman:
Now it's Jade's turn

368
00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:41,746
to give her report.

369
00:19:41,748 --> 00:19:44,215
Ahem. On my day at work,

370
00:19:44,217 --> 00:19:47,518
uncle Jackie and I went
scuba diving for artifacts,

371
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,887
but a big storm kicked up,

372
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:51,489
and we wound up
shipwrecked.

373
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:54,425
Yeah, right.

374
00:19:54,427 --> 00:19:59,263
And there were
these monkeys and...

375
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,099
Ahem.

376
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:04,035
To uncover artifacts,

377
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:05,503
the archeologist

378
00:20:05,505 --> 00:20:06,938
digs in the dirt

379
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,540
with little, tiny brushes,

380
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:10,908
being very careful

381
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,977
not to damage anything.

382
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:16,814
Jade: Hey, Jackie,

383
00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:18,182
do you have any pets?

384
00:20:18,184 --> 00:20:19,450
I love pets.

385
00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:21,652
Very, very good
for the human.

386
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:23,854
If your partner
is your friends--

387
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:27,425
if you have a pet, you have
him with you every day.

388
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:29,026
I remember long time ago,

389
00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:31,996
I have 3 Saint bernards.
Big dog.

390
00:20:31,998 --> 00:20:33,164
I love big one.

391
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:35,566
The problem is,
all those years,

392
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:37,268
I been traveling around
making movies.

393
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,370
6 months later,
when I coming back,

394
00:20:39,372 --> 00:20:40,605
I said, "nuh nuh nuh,"

395
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:42,673
he bite me. He don't
listen me anymore.

396
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:44,675
So it's no good.

397
00:20:44,677 --> 00:20:46,177
But later on,

398
00:20:46,179 --> 00:20:49,046
when I retire,
settle down, yes.
