1
00:00:13,766 --> 00:00:15,768
Is there a number we can call
for your parents?

2
00:00:15,851 --> 00:00:17,937
Where's your hair?
Do you have cancer?

3
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,230
Did you run away?

4
00:00:19,313 --> 00:00:21,232
-Are you in some kind of trouble?
-Is that blood?

5
00:00:22,024 --> 00:00:24,109
-Stop it! You're freaking her out!
-She's freaking me out!

6
00:00:24,193 --> 00:00:25,402
I bet she's deaf.

7
00:00:27,488 --> 00:00:28,572
Not deaf.

8
00:00:28,656 --> 00:00:31,951
All right, that's enough, all right?
She's just scared and cold.

9
00:00:38,582 --> 00:00:40,417
Here, these are clean.
Okay?

10
00:00:51,136 --> 00:00:52,388
- No, no, no!

11
00:00:52,471 --> 00:00:54,098
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

12
00:00:54,181 --> 00:00:57,434
- See over there?
- That's the bathroom.

13
00:00:57,518 --> 00:00:59,520
Privacy.
Get it?

14
00:01:14,743 --> 00:01:15,911
You don't want it closed?

15
00:01:17,746 --> 00:01:18,747
No.

16
00:01:18,831 --> 00:01:20,916
Oh, so you can speak.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,210
Okay, well...

18
00:01:23,294 --> 00:01:27,298
Um, how about we just keep the door...

19
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,135
just like this.

20
00:01:31,635 --> 00:01:34,346
-Is that better?
-Yes.

21
00:01:39,977 --> 00:01:42,104
- This is mental.
- At least she can talk.

22
00:01:42,187 --> 00:01:45,065
She said "no" and "yes."
Your three-year-old sister says more.

23
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:46,859
She tried to get naked.

24
00:01:46,942 --> 00:01:48,569
There's something
seriously wrong with her.

25
00:01:48,652 --> 00:01:52,156
-Like, wrong in the head.
-She just went like...

26
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:53,699
I bet she escaped from Pennhurst.

27
00:01:53,782 --> 00:01:56,410
-From where?
-The nuthouse in Kerley County.

28
00:01:56,493 --> 00:01:58,120
-You got a lot of family there?
-Bite me.

29
00:01:58,203 --> 00:02:00,205
Seriously though, think about it.

30
00:02:00,289 --> 00:02:03,334
That would explain her shaved hair
and why she's so crazy.

31
00:02:03,417 --> 00:02:04,543
Why she went like...

32
00:02:04,627 --> 00:02:07,421
She's an escapee is the point.
She's probably a psycho.

33
00:02:07,504 --> 00:02:09,506
- Like Michael Myers.
- Exactly!

34
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,175
We should've never brought her here.

35
00:02:11,258 --> 00:02:12,593
So you just wanted to leave her
out in that storm?

36
00:02:12,676 --> 00:02:15,429
Yes! We went out to find Will,
not another problem.

37
00:02:15,512 --> 00:02:17,222
-I think we should tell your mom.
-I second that.

38
00:02:17,306 --> 00:02:19,266
-Who's crazy now?
-How is that crazy?

39
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:21,935
'Cause, we weren't supposed to be
out tonight, remember?

40
00:02:22,019 --> 00:02:24,355
-So?
-So if I tell my mom

41
00:02:24,438 --> 00:02:26,273
and she tells your mom
and your mom...

42
00:02:26,357 --> 00:02:28,609
-Oh, man.
-Our houses become Alcatraz.

43
00:02:28,692 --> 00:02:31,278
Exactly.
We'll never find Will.

44
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,574
All right, here's the plan.
She sleeps here tonight.

45
00:02:35,658 --> 00:02:37,785
-You're letting a girl--
-Just listen!

46
00:02:37,868 --> 00:02:39,828
In the morning,
she sneaks around my house,

47
00:02:39,912 --> 00:02:41,955
goes to the front door
and rings my doorbell.

48
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:43,832
My mom will answer and know
exactly what to do.

49
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:46,168
She'll send her back to Pennhurst
or wherever she comes from.

50
00:02:46,251 --> 00:02:47,378
We'll be totally in the clear.

51
00:02:47,461 --> 00:02:49,254
And tomorrow night, we go back out.

52
00:02:49,338 --> 00:02:51,715
And this time, we find Will.

53
00:02:56,345 --> 00:02:58,347
Here you go.
This is my sleeping bag.

54
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,724
You really think she's psycho?

55
00:03:00,808 --> 00:03:02,393
Wouldn't want her in my house.

56
00:03:06,814 --> 00:03:08,440
Mental.

57
00:03:10,609 --> 00:03:12,778
Hey, um, I never asked your name.

58
00:03:20,244 --> 00:03:21,495
Is that real?

59
00:03:24,331 --> 00:03:28,585
Sorry, I've just... never seen
a kid with a tattoo before.

60
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,213
What's it mean?
Eleven?

61
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:35,676
That's your name?

62
00:03:37,803 --> 00:03:39,847
Eleven. Okay.

63
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:43,267
Um, well, my name's Mike.
Short for Michael.

64
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:46,562
Maybe we can call you "El."
Short for Eleven.

65
00:03:50,607 --> 00:03:52,025
Um, well, okay.

66
00:03:52,943 --> 00:03:54,194
'Night, El.

67
00:03:56,447 --> 00:03:57,740
'Night, Mike.

68
00:05:52,145 --> 00:05:55,816
All right, Mom.
Breakfast is ready.

69
00:05:55,899 --> 00:05:58,694
-What? No, be careful of the poster.
-Yeah, okay. All right.

70
00:05:58,777 --> 00:06:00,654
-I can't eat.
-I just need you to eat, Mom.

71
00:06:00,737 --> 00:06:04,157
Listen. Listen, the Xerox place
opens in, like, 30 minutes.

72
00:06:04,241 --> 00:06:05,659
-Yeah.
-And I don't want you to go alone...

73
00:06:05,742 --> 00:06:06,827
No, I know.
I told you, I got it.

74
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:09,329
...so I'm gonna have Karen take you,
'cause I should be here.

75
00:06:09,413 --> 00:06:11,790
-Okay.
-We need to make, what, 200, 300 copies?

76
00:06:11,873 --> 00:06:13,000
-How much is a copy?
-Yeah, okay.

77
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:14,167
-Okay, Mom. Mom.
-Ten cents?

78
00:06:14,251 --> 00:06:16,878
- If we... Ten cents--
- Mom. Mom. Mom!

79
00:06:16,962 --> 00:06:19,214
You can't get like this, okay?

80
00:06:19,298 --> 00:06:21,717
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
-No, it's okay.

81
00:06:24,303 --> 00:06:27,598
We've been waiting six hours.

82
00:06:27,681 --> 00:06:29,391
I know.
I came as soon as I could.

83
00:06:29,474 --> 00:06:31,059
Six hours.

84
00:06:31,143 --> 00:06:33,270
A little bit of trust here, all right?

85
00:06:33,353 --> 00:06:36,315
We've been searching all night.
Went all the way to Cartersville.

86
00:06:36,398 --> 00:06:38,066
-And?
-Nothing.

87
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,568
God.

88
00:06:42,237 --> 00:06:43,655
Flo says you got a phone call?

89
00:06:43,739 --> 00:06:45,907
Oh, yeah.

90
00:06:53,206 --> 00:06:54,833
Storm barbecued this pretty good.

91
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:57,336
-The storm?
-What else?

92
00:06:57,419 --> 00:07:00,339
You're saying that that's not weird?

93
00:07:00,422 --> 00:07:02,090
No, it's weird.

94
00:07:02,174 --> 00:07:04,676
Can we, like, trace who made the call?
Contact the--

95
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,762
No, it doesn't work like that.

96
00:07:06,845 --> 00:07:08,597
Now, uh, you're sure it was Will?

97
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,349
Because Flo said
you just heard some breathing.

98
00:07:10,432 --> 00:07:13,477
No. It was him.
It was Will.

99
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:18,523
And he was scared.
And then something--

100
00:07:18,607 --> 00:07:21,443
It was probably just a prank call.
It was somebody trying to scare you.

101
00:07:21,526 --> 00:07:23,278
-Who would do that?
-Well, this thing's been on TV.

102
00:07:23,362 --> 00:07:26,531
It brings out all the crazies, you know.
False leads, prank calls, uh...

103
00:07:26,615 --> 00:07:29,618
No, Hopper, it was not a prank.
It was him.

104
00:07:29,701 --> 00:07:32,329
-Joyce.
-Come on, how about a little trust here?

105
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:35,624
What, you think I'm... I'm making this up?

106
00:07:35,707 --> 00:07:37,167
I'm not saying that you're making it up.

107
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,711
All I'm saying is
it's an emotional time for you.

108
00:07:39,795 --> 00:07:43,090
And you think I don't know
my own son's breathing?

109
00:07:43,173 --> 00:07:44,800
Wouldn't you know your own daughter's?

110
00:07:58,689 --> 00:08:01,858
-You hear from, uh, Lonnie yet?
-No.

111
00:08:02,442 --> 00:08:04,319
It's been long enough.
I'm having him checked out.

112
00:08:04,403 --> 00:08:06,071
Oh, come on!

113
00:08:06,154 --> 00:08:08,240
You're wasting your time.

114
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,952
Hey, Hopper.

115
00:08:12,035 --> 00:08:14,204
Hopper.

116
00:08:14,287 --> 00:08:15,539
Let me go.

117
00:08:17,165 --> 00:08:18,959
-I'm sorry?
-To Lonnie's.

118
00:08:19,042 --> 00:08:21,920
You know, if Will's there,
it means he ran away.

119
00:08:22,004 --> 00:08:24,423
And if he sees the cops,
he'll think he's in trouble.

120
00:08:24,506 --> 00:08:26,216
He'll... He'll hide.

121
00:08:26,299 --> 00:08:28,010
-You know, he's good at hiding.
-Yeah?

122
00:08:29,177 --> 00:08:31,430
Well, cops are good at finding.
Okay?

123
00:08:31,513 --> 00:08:33,181
Stay here with your mom.

124
00:08:34,391 --> 00:08:35,475
She needs you.

125
00:08:54,202 --> 00:08:56,830
Slow down, Mike.
That's disgusting.

126
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:00,167
Do a lot of studying last night?

127
00:09:00,917 --> 00:09:02,836
Yeah, actually, I did.

128
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:05,297
What was your test on again?
Human anatomy?

129
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,092
Hey, what's going on?

130
00:09:10,385 --> 00:09:11,595
Nothing.

131
00:09:23,023 --> 00:09:24,399
Hey, you found my supercomm.

132
00:09:24,483 --> 00:09:25,650
Pretty cool, huh?

133
00:09:26,318 --> 00:09:27,611
I talk to my friends with it.

134
00:09:27,694 --> 00:09:29,571
Mostly Lucas,
'cause he lives so close.

135
00:09:29,654 --> 00:09:30,739
Signal's pretty weak.

136
00:09:34,951 --> 00:09:36,119
Got you breakfast.

137
00:09:38,705 --> 00:09:40,665
So listen, this is gonna
sound a little weird,

138
00:09:40,749 --> 00:09:42,084
but I just need you to go out there.

139
00:09:42,167 --> 00:09:44,294
Then go to the front door
and ring the doorbell.

140
00:09:44,377 --> 00:09:47,923
My mom will answer and you'll tell her
that you're lost and that you need help.

141
00:09:48,006 --> 00:09:52,135
But whatever you do, you can't tell her
about last night or that you know me.

142
00:09:52,219 --> 00:09:53,220
Understand?

143
00:09:54,346 --> 00:09:55,722
Really, it's no big deal.

144
00:09:55,806 --> 00:09:57,933
We'll just pretend
to meet each other again.

145
00:09:58,934 --> 00:10:01,603
And my mom, she'll know who to call.

146
00:10:04,064 --> 00:10:05,107
No.

147
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:07,526
No?

148
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,361
No.

149
00:10:10,362 --> 00:10:13,782
No... you don't want my mom to get help?

150
00:10:18,578 --> 00:10:21,123
You're in trouble, aren't you?

151
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,002
Who...

152
00:10:27,462 --> 00:10:29,131
Who are you in trouble with?

153
00:10:31,883 --> 00:10:33,426
Bad.

154
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,594
Bad?

155
00:10:35,595 --> 00:10:36,763
Bad people?

156
00:10:40,433 --> 00:10:42,477
They want to hurt you?

157
00:10:42,561 --> 00:10:43,979
The bad people?

158
00:10:53,738 --> 00:10:55,407
Understand?

159
00:10:56,491 --> 00:10:58,994
Michael, where are you?
We're going to be late.

160
00:10:59,077 --> 00:11:00,787
- Let's go!
- All right, I'll be back.

161
00:11:00,871 --> 00:11:02,622
Just stay here, okay?
Stay here.

162
00:11:09,963 --> 00:11:11,381
When was this?

163
00:11:11,464 --> 00:11:13,091
Last night.
Less than two miles away.

164
00:11:13,174 --> 00:11:14,968
-And the boy?
-Still missing.

165
00:11:15,719 --> 00:11:18,763
It was my son.
I know it.

166
00:11:18,847 --> 00:11:21,141
And I... I heard something else.

167
00:11:21,224 --> 00:11:22,601
Something else?

168
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:27,314
It was like, uh,
some kind of animal.

169
00:11:27,397 --> 00:11:30,901
I don't know.
Just please tell Hop to hurry.

170
00:11:30,984 --> 00:11:33,904
Will! Will Byers!

171
00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:36,656
Will Byers!

172
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,494
- Will!
- Will!

173
00:11:41,578 --> 00:11:44,331
Hey!
Anything?

174
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:46,333
You?

175
00:11:47,292 --> 00:11:49,544
No, nothing but a dead phone.

176
00:11:49,628 --> 00:11:50,629
Joyce?

177
00:11:50,712 --> 00:11:53,465
About one step from falling off the edge.

178
00:11:53,548 --> 00:11:55,967
She's been a few steps
for a while now, hasn't she?

179
00:11:56,051 --> 00:11:57,802
Kid's missing, man.

180
00:11:57,886 --> 00:11:59,179
Show a little class.

181
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,682
All right. Come on, let's go!

182
00:12:02,766 --> 00:12:05,018
We got a lot of ground to cover.

183
00:12:05,101 --> 00:12:07,520
The chief and her,
they've screwed before, huh?

184
00:12:10,065 --> 00:12:11,733
Will!

185
00:12:11,816 --> 00:12:13,276
That a "yeah" or did they...

186
00:12:14,319 --> 00:12:16,404
-Will!
-Will!

187
00:12:23,954 --> 00:12:27,374
"When alpha particles go through
gold foil, they become..."

188
00:12:27,457 --> 00:12:30,001
-Unoccupied space.
-"A molecule that can--"

189
00:12:30,085 --> 00:12:31,169
- Hey!
- I don't know,

190
00:12:31,252 --> 00:12:32,545
I think you've studied enough, Nance.

191
00:12:32,629 --> 00:12:34,673
- Steve--
- I'm telling you, you know, you got this.

192
00:12:34,756 --> 00:12:37,092
Don't worry.
Now, on to more important matters.

193
00:12:37,175 --> 00:12:40,136
My dad has left town on a conference
and my mom's gone with him,

194
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,639
-'cause, you know, she doesn't trust him.
-Good call.

195
00:12:42,722 --> 00:12:43,723
So are you in?

196
00:12:43,807 --> 00:12:45,225
In for what?

197
00:12:45,308 --> 00:12:47,060
No parents? Big house?

198
00:12:47,727 --> 00:12:48,853
A party?

199
00:12:48,937 --> 00:12:50,855
- Ding, ding, ding!

200
00:12:50,981 --> 00:12:52,399
It's Tuesday.

201
00:12:52,482 --> 00:12:53,942
It's Tuesday!
Oh, my God.

202
00:12:54,025 --> 00:12:55,360
--Come on.

203
00:12:55,443 --> 00:12:57,195
It'll be low key.
It'll just be us.

204
00:12:57,278 --> 00:12:59,656
What do you say?
Are you in or are you out?

205
00:12:59,739 --> 00:13:03,576
-Um...
-Oh, God. Look.

206
00:13:04,577 --> 00:13:06,287
Oh, God, that's depressing.

207
00:13:08,498 --> 00:13:11,751
-Should we say something?
-I don't think he speaks.

208
00:13:11,835 --> 00:13:13,586
How much you want to bet he killed him?

209
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:14,921
Shut up.

210
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,722
Hey.

211
00:13:23,805 --> 00:13:25,390
Oh, hey.

212
00:13:25,473 --> 00:13:26,641
I just...

213
00:13:27,809 --> 00:13:31,104
I wanted to say, you know, um...

214
00:13:31,187 --> 00:13:33,106
I'm sorry about everything.

215
00:13:38,528 --> 00:13:40,822
Everyone's thinking about you.

216
00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:45,618
-It sucks.
-Yeah.

217
00:13:49,122 --> 00:13:50,373
I'm sure he's fine.

218
00:13:50,457 --> 00:13:52,125
He's a smart kid.

219
00:13:55,045 --> 00:13:56,921
I have to go.
Chemistry test.

220
00:13:57,005 --> 00:13:58,006
Yeah.

221
00:13:58,089 --> 00:13:59,549
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

222
00:14:04,345 --> 00:14:06,890
Attention, faculty and students.

223
00:14:06,973 --> 00:14:10,435
At 8:00 p.m. tonight, there will be
an assembly on the football field

224
00:14:10,518 --> 00:14:12,854
in support of Will Byers and his family.

225
00:14:12,937 --> 00:14:15,065
All are encouraged to attend.

226
00:14:15,148 --> 00:14:19,319
Volunteer sign-ups for search parties
are still available in the office.

227
00:14:25,492 --> 00:14:26,701
Oh, this is weird.

228
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,163
-He's never this late.
-I'm telling you, his stupid plan failed.

229
00:14:30,246 --> 00:14:31,498
I thought you liked his plan.

230
00:14:31,581 --> 00:14:33,917
Yeah, but obviously it was stupid,
or he'd be here.

231
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,960
If his mom found out
a girl spent the night--

232
00:14:36,044 --> 00:14:37,545
He's in deep shit right about now.

233
00:14:37,629 --> 00:14:40,298
Hey, what if she slept naked?

234
00:14:40,382 --> 00:14:42,300
Oh, my God, she didn't.

235
00:14:42,384 --> 00:14:44,594
Oh, if Mrs. Wheeler tells my parents...

236
00:14:44,677 --> 00:14:47,555
-No way. Mike would never rat us out.
-I don't know.

237
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:50,850
All that matters is, after school,
the freak will be back in the loony bin,

238
00:14:50,934 --> 00:14:54,062
and we can focus on what really matters,
finding Will.

239
00:15:10,203 --> 00:15:11,413
You want anything to drink?

240
00:15:11,496 --> 00:15:14,165
We have OJ, skim milk...
What else?

241
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,876
Um, we have...

242
00:15:18,795 --> 00:15:20,547
Oh, this is my living room.

243
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:22,173
It's mostly just for watching TV.

244
00:15:22,257 --> 00:15:24,801
Nice, right?
It's a 22-inch.

245
00:15:24,884 --> 00:15:26,970
That's, like, ten times bigger
than Dustin's.

246
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,692
-Pretty.
-I guess.

247
00:15:40,775 --> 00:15:42,193
That's my sister Nancy.

248
00:15:42,277 --> 00:15:43,903
And that's baby Holly.

249
00:15:43,987 --> 00:15:45,363
And those are my parents.

250
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,157
What are your parents like?

251
00:15:47,782 --> 00:15:49,200
Do they live close?

252
00:15:51,619 --> 00:15:53,204
That's our La-Z-Boy.

253
00:15:54,914 --> 00:15:56,166
It's where my dad sleeps.

254
00:15:56,249 --> 00:15:58,960
You can try it if you want.

255
00:15:59,627 --> 00:16:00,628
Yeah.

256
00:16:01,963 --> 00:16:02,964
It's fun.

257
00:16:06,593 --> 00:16:08,428
Just trust me, okay?

258
00:16:14,267 --> 00:16:15,935
See? Fun, right?

259
00:16:17,812 --> 00:16:18,813

The storm last night, I...

293
00:18:50,757 --> 00:18:52,925
I need a new phone.

294
00:18:54,135 --> 00:18:57,555
Okay, that looks like $22.56.

295
00:18:57,639 --> 00:18:59,432
Uh, yeah, you know, uh...

296
00:18:59,515 --> 00:19:01,809
I gave Jonathan all my money for...

297
00:19:01,893 --> 00:19:03,686
for the copies for the posters.

298
00:19:04,687 --> 00:19:07,148
Uh, I need an advance.

299
00:19:08,066 --> 00:19:09,567
Yes, well, of course.

300
00:19:09,651 --> 00:19:11,235
- Of course.
- Thank you.

301
00:19:16,157 --> 00:19:18,660

two weeks?

302
00:19:20,912 --> 00:19:22,163
Um...

303
00:19:23,956 --> 00:19:27,293
Yes, I understand, but, you know,
I have to pay Jeffrey for covering--

00:19:27,377 --> 00:19:28,378
Donald.

305
00:19:28,461 --> 00:19:31,673
I've been here ten years, right?

306
00:19:31,756 --> 00:19:35,718
Have I ever called in sick
or missed a shift once?

307
00:19:35,802 --> 00:19:39,180
I've worked, uh,
Christmas Eve and Thanksgiving.

308
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,684
I don't know
where my boy is.

309
00:19:42,767 --> 00:19:43,976
He's gone.

310
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:48,106
I don't know if I'm...
gonna ever see him again, if he's hurt...

311
00:19:49,857 --> 00:19:51,192
I, uh...

312
00:19:52,735 --> 00:19:56,447
I need this phone
and two weeks' advance.

313
00:20:00,076 --> 00:20:01,828
And a pack of Camels.

314
00:20:12,171 --> 00:20:14,132
- We're all clear.
- Copy that.

315
00:21:11,481 --> 00:21:13,107
Extraordinary.

316
00:21:16,486 --> 00:21:18,946
Ready are you?
What knows you of ready?

317
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:20,323
His name's Yoda.

318
00:21:20,406 --> 00:21:23,534
He can use the Force to move things
with his mind, like this.

319
00:21:23,618 --> 00:21:24,952
Whoosh!

320
00:21:26,704 --> 00:21:28,414
Oh, this is my dinosaur, Rory.

321
00:21:28,498 --> 00:21:30,333
Look, he has a speaker in his mouth
so he can roar.

322
00:21:39,091 --> 00:21:41,385
Oh, these are all my
science fair trophies.

323
00:21:41,469 --> 00:21:43,805
We got first every year.

324
00:21:43,888 --> 00:21:46,599
Except for last year when we got third.

325
00:21:46,682 --> 00:21:48,768
Mr. Clarke said it was totally political.

326
00:22:08,746 --> 00:22:09,872
You know Will?

327
00:22:10,915 --> 00:22:15,044
Did you see him? Last night?
On the road?

328
00:22:21,551 --> 00:22:22,718
We gotta go.

329
00:22:26,264 --> 00:22:28,307
I bought pizza
and macaroni.

330
00:22:28,391 --> 00:22:29,934
- Okay.
- Okay.

331
00:22:33,437 --> 00:22:35,565
Ted? Is that you?

332
00:22:35,648 --> 00:22:36,857
Just me, Mom!

333
00:22:36,941 --> 00:22:39,610
-Mike? What are you doing home?
-One second!

334
00:22:44,031 --> 00:22:45,950
In here.
I'll be right back, okay?

335
00:22:46,033 --> 00:22:48,744
Please, you have to get in,
or my mom, she'll find you.

336
00:22:48,828 --> 00:22:50,788
Do you understand?

337
00:22:50,871 --> 00:22:52,456
I won't tell her about you.
I promise.

338
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,916
Promise?

339
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,002
It means something that you can't break.

340
00:22:56,085 --> 00:22:58,004
- Ever.
- Michael?

341
00:22:58,629 --> 00:22:59,672
Please?

342
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,733
Pop!

343
00:23:22,945 --> 00:23:24,280
Papa!

344
00:23:25,573 --> 00:23:26,866
Papa!

345
00:23:26,949 --> 00:23:28,284
No!

346
00:23:29,201 --> 00:23:30,328
Papa!

347
00:23:30,411 --> 00:23:32,747
No! No!
No!

348
00:23:37,543 --> 00:23:38,586
Papa!

349
00:23:38,669 --> 00:23:40,338
- Papa!

350
00:23:40,421 --> 00:23:41,839
Papa!

351
00:23:41,922 --> 00:23:44,008
Papa!

352
00:23:44,091 --> 00:23:45,259
Papa!

353
00:23:48,846 --> 00:23:49,889
Papa.

354
00:23:59,482 --> 00:24:01,901
I just... I don't feel good.

355
00:24:01,984 --> 00:24:04,654
I woke up and my head,
it really hurt bad,

356
00:24:04,737 --> 00:24:06,947
and my throat was all scratchy,
and I wanted to tell you,

357
00:24:07,031 --> 00:24:08,407
but the last time I told you I was sick

358
00:24:08,491 --> 00:24:10,409
-you made me go to school anyway, and--
-Michael.

359
00:24:10,493 --> 00:24:13,329
-Yeah?
-I'm not mad at you.

360
00:24:13,412 --> 00:24:16,707
-No?
-No, of course not.

361
00:24:19,043 --> 00:24:21,962
All this that's been going on with Will,

362
00:24:22,046 --> 00:24:24,173
I can't imagine
what it's been like for you.

363
00:24:25,508 --> 00:24:26,967
I just...

364
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:29,512
I want you to feel like
you can talk to me.

365
00:24:29,595 --> 00:24:33,349
I never want you to feel like you have
to hide anything from me.

366
00:24:33,432 --> 00:24:35,559
I'm here for you. Okay?

367
00:24:38,145 --> 00:24:39,313
Is there someone else here?

368
00:24:41,023 --> 00:24:42,024
No.

369
00:24:44,151 --> 00:24:45,528
Eleven?

370
00:24:45,611 --> 00:24:47,196
Is everything okay?

371
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:48,322
El?

372
00:24:52,743 --> 00:24:54,704
- Mike.
- Is everything okay?

373
00:24:57,665 --> 00:24:59,125
Are you sure?

374
00:25:00,418 --> 00:25:01,794
Promise.

375
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:41,333
- Will Byers!
- Will!

376
00:25:43,544 --> 00:25:44,962
Whoa, whoa.
Careful, careful.

377
00:25:45,045 --> 00:25:47,256
I need you alive for the next few days,
at least.

378
00:25:47,339 --> 00:25:49,592
Oh, hell, I could survive that.

379
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,803
What?
George Burness made the jump.

380
00:25:52,887 --> 00:25:55,222
And he was drunk as a skunk.
He did it on a $10 bet.

381
00:25:55,306 --> 00:25:56,307
George is a liar.

382
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:59,268
You make that jump from this height,
that water turns into cement.

383
00:25:59,351 --> 00:26:01,854
Hits you like a ton of bricks.
Break every damn bone in your body.

384
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,150
Nah.

385
00:26:06,233 --> 00:26:08,027
Chief, you copy?

386
00:26:09,612 --> 00:26:11,113
Yeah, Flo, talk to me.

387
00:26:11,197 --> 00:26:13,949
Hey, Chief, we got a call
from over at Benny's.

388
00:26:14,033 --> 00:26:15,868
I think you need to get there right away.

389
00:26:38,808 --> 00:26:40,309
Ugh, Jesus!

390
00:26:46,482 --> 00:26:47,608
Suicide?

391
00:26:49,068 --> 00:26:50,569
Mmm-hmm.

392
00:26:50,653 --> 00:26:52,738
Missing kid, suicide...

393
00:26:52,822 --> 00:26:55,533
You must feel like a big city cop again,
huh, Chief?

394
00:26:57,243 --> 00:26:59,995
Well, I mostly dealt
with strangers back then.

395
00:27:02,456 --> 00:27:04,250
Benny was my friend.

396
00:27:41,036 --> 00:27:42,329
Hello?

397
00:27:43,622 --> 00:27:44,832
Yeah.

398
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,254
-Can I help you?
-Yeah, is Lonnie around?

399
00:27:50,337 --> 00:27:52,339
-Yeah, he's out back. What do you want?
-To look around.

400
00:27:52,423 --> 00:27:54,925
-Hey, what do you think you're doing? Hey!
-I'll be fast.

401
00:27:55,009 --> 00:27:56,343
Hey, Will?

402
00:27:56,427 --> 00:27:57,803
Will!

403
00:27:57,887 --> 00:27:59,972
Will, you here?
Will!

404
00:28:04,894 --> 00:28:06,103
Get off!

405
00:28:07,271 --> 00:28:08,856
Damn, you've gotten stronger.

406
00:28:08,939 --> 00:28:11,066
Will someone please explain
what the hell is going on?

407
00:28:12,026 --> 00:28:15,321
Jonathan, Cynthia.
Cynthia, this is Jonathan.

408
00:28:15,404 --> 00:28:16,405
My oldest.

409
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:21,368
-Come here.
-Get off me, man.

410
00:28:34,548 --> 00:28:36,842
-Are you out of your mind?
-Just listen to me.

411
00:28:36,926 --> 00:28:38,719
-You are out of your mind!
-She knows about Will.

412
00:28:38,802 --> 00:28:40,512
What do you mean she knows about Will?

413
00:28:41,639 --> 00:28:44,683
She pointed at him, at his picture.
She knew he was missing. I could tell.

414
00:28:44,767 --> 00:28:46,644
- You could tell?
- Just think about it.

415
00:28:46,727 --> 00:28:48,938
Do you really think it was a coincidence
that we found her on Mirkwood,

416
00:28:49,021 --> 00:28:50,648
the same place where Will disappeared?

417
00:28:50,731 --> 00:28:53,025
-That is weird.
-And she said bad people are after her.

418
00:28:53,108 --> 00:28:56,403
I think maybe these bad people
are the same ones that took Will.

419
00:28:56,487 --> 00:28:59,865
-I think she knows what happened to him.
-Then why doesn't she tell us?

420
00:29:02,034 --> 00:29:04,078
Do you know where he is?

421
00:29:04,161 --> 00:29:05,162
Do you know where Will is?

422
00:29:05,246 --> 00:29:07,581
-Stop it, you're scaring her!
-She should be scared!

423
00:29:07,665 --> 00:29:10,542
If you know where he is, tell us!

424
00:29:11,877 --> 00:29:14,421
This is nuts.
We have to take her to your mom.

425
00:29:14,505 --> 00:29:16,924
No! Eleven said telling any adult
would put us in danger.

426
00:29:17,007 --> 00:29:19,426
-What kind of danger?
-Her name is Eleven?

427
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:22,012
-El for short.
-Mike, what kind of danger?

428
00:29:22,096 --> 00:29:23,722
Danger danger.

429
00:29:29,561 --> 00:29:31,480
No, no, no!

430
00:29:31,563 --> 00:29:34,316
We're going back to plan A.
We're telling your mom.

431
00:29:45,911 --> 00:29:46,996
No.

432
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:55,921
Take a look at this beaut.
Should've seen it when I got it.

433
00:29:56,005 --> 00:29:57,881
Took me a year, but it's almost done.

434
00:29:58,882 --> 00:30:01,760
Really?
You want to check up my ass, too?

435
00:30:02,428 --> 00:30:04,263
I told you the same thing
as I told those cops,

436
00:30:04,346 --> 00:30:05,931
he's not here and he never has been.

437
00:30:06,015 --> 00:30:09,018
-Then why didn't you call Mom back?
-I don't know, I just...

438
00:30:09,101 --> 00:30:11,603
I assumed she just forgot where he was.

439
00:30:11,687 --> 00:30:13,230
You know, he was lost or something.

440
00:30:14,273 --> 00:30:16,567
That boy never was very good
at taking care of himself.

441
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:19,778
This isn't some joke, all right?
There are search parties, reporters...

442
00:30:19,862 --> 00:30:21,196
Hopper's not still chief, is he?

443
00:30:23,324 --> 00:30:26,410
Tell your mother
she's gotta get you out of that hellhole.

444
00:30:26,493 --> 00:30:28,454
Come out here to the city.

445
00:30:28,537 --> 00:30:30,164
People are more real here, you know?

446
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,958
And then I could see you more.

447
00:30:35,127 --> 00:30:37,588
-What, you think I don't want to see you?
-I know you don't.

448
00:30:37,671 --> 00:30:39,715
See, that's your mother talkin'
right there.

449
00:30:40,966 --> 00:30:42,092
She even know you're here?

450
00:30:43,135 --> 00:30:44,136
Oh, great.

451
00:30:44,219 --> 00:30:46,930
So one kid goes missing,
the other one runs wild?

452
00:30:47,014 --> 00:30:48,807
Some real fine parenting right there.

453
00:30:48,891 --> 00:30:52,644
Look, all I'm saying is,
maybe I'm not the asshole, all right?

454
00:30:57,358 --> 00:30:59,026
In case you forgot what he looks like.

455
00:31:02,613 --> 00:31:04,365
He's kinda cute, hmm?

456
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:06,492
Maybe I'll trade you in
for the younger model?

457
00:31:08,952 --> 00:31:10,496
Just doesn't make any sense, Chief.

458
00:31:14,041 --> 00:31:15,459
You, uh, notice anything...

459
00:31:16,502 --> 00:31:17,878
odd about him the last few weeks?

460
00:31:17,961 --> 00:31:21,215
No, we're fixin' to go fishing
down the Etowah next Sunday.

461
00:31:21,298 --> 00:31:23,425
I mean, he was lookin' forward to it.
I know that.

462
00:31:23,509 --> 00:31:25,719
He got any enemies you might know about?

463
00:31:25,803 --> 00:31:27,888
I mean,
people who might not want him around?

464
00:31:27,971 --> 00:31:30,974
The exes didn't like him much.
That's for sure, but...

465
00:31:31,975 --> 00:31:33,519
nah.

466
00:31:33,602 --> 00:31:37,356
-When was the last time you saw him?
-Yesterday. Lunch, same as always.

467
00:31:37,439 --> 00:31:39,691
-Just you and the boys?
-Yep.

468
00:31:39,775 --> 00:31:41,860
Me and Henry and...

469
00:31:43,153 --> 00:31:45,697
Well, there was this, uh, this kid.

470
00:31:46,698 --> 00:31:47,825
No kid did this.

471
00:31:48,784 --> 00:31:49,827
Kid?

472
00:31:51,245 --> 00:31:52,704
What are you talking about?

473
00:31:52,788 --> 00:31:57,709
Yeah. At lunch, uh,
there was this boy that, uh...

474
00:31:57,793 --> 00:32:00,546
I mean, he was trying to steal
food out of Benny's kitchen.

475
00:32:00,629 --> 00:32:02,005
Can you imagine that?

476
00:32:04,967 --> 00:32:06,009
This kid...

477
00:32:07,636 --> 00:32:08,762
what'd he look like?

478
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:13,225
Well, he was about yea high.
You know, tiny like.

479
00:32:13,308 --> 00:32:15,686
I didn't get a good look at him, though.
He was back in the kitchen.

480
00:32:15,769 --> 00:32:17,229
He look like this?

481
00:32:18,021 --> 00:32:20,941
Oh, no, that's...
That's Lonnie's missin' kid.

482
00:32:21,024 --> 00:32:23,068
No. This was a different kid.

483
00:32:23,152 --> 00:32:24,611
This one had really short hair.

484
00:32:24,695 --> 00:32:26,780
I mean, it was buzzed
nearly down to the scalp.

485
00:32:26,864 --> 00:32:29,491
Yeah, well, let's...
You know, let's forget about the haircut.

486
00:32:29,575 --> 00:32:32,661
I mean, if this kid had a buzz cut...

487
00:32:32,744 --> 00:32:34,121
could it be Lonnie's kid?

488
00:32:34,872 --> 00:32:37,166
Well, I...
I didn't get a good look at him.

489
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:41,128
About the right height, though.

490
00:32:41,211 --> 00:32:42,880
I mean, could've been.

491
00:32:43,964 --> 00:32:45,632
Yeah, that's...

492
00:32:45,716 --> 00:32:46,717
Could've been.

493
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:52,931
Because I don't want to go by myself.

494
00:32:53,015 --> 00:32:56,185
Barb...
Barb, it's not rocket science.

495
00:32:56,268 --> 00:32:59,646
You just tell your parents you're gonna
stay at my place afterwards.

496
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:02,608
No, tell them we're... studying.

497
00:33:02,691 --> 00:33:04,401
Nancy! Dinner!

498
00:33:04,485 --> 00:33:06,195
Coming!

499
00:33:06,278 --> 00:33:08,947
Look, I gotta go.
I'll see you in an hour.

500
00:33:18,665 --> 00:33:20,292
Something wrong with the meatloaf?

501
00:33:21,168 --> 00:33:24,213
Oh, no, I had two
bologna sandwiches for lunch.

502
00:33:26,006 --> 00:33:27,007
I don't know why.

503
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:28,967
Me, too.

504
00:33:30,177 --> 00:33:32,513
-It's delicious, Mommy.
-Thank you, sweetie.

505
00:33:33,347 --> 00:33:34,973
So, there's this...

506
00:33:35,057 --> 00:33:37,559
special assembly thing tonight...

507
00:33:37,643 --> 00:33:39,937
for Will at the school field.

508
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,021
Barb's driving.

509
00:33:41,104 --> 00:33:43,273
Why am I just hearing about this?

510
00:33:44,149 --> 00:33:45,192
I thought you knew.

511
00:33:45,275 --> 00:33:48,362
I told you, I don't want you
out after dark until Will is found.

512
00:33:48,445 --> 00:33:51,782
I know, I know, but it'd be
super weird if I'm not there.

513
00:33:51,865 --> 00:33:53,909
I mean, everyone's going.

514
00:33:57,162 --> 00:33:59,081
Just... be back by 10:00.

515
00:34:00,499 --> 00:34:01,667
Why don't you take the boys, too?

516
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:02,960
-No!
-Mmm-mmm.

517
00:34:04,628 --> 00:34:06,713
Don't you think you should be there?
For Will?

518
00:34:10,759 --> 00:34:13,011
Sorry. Spasm.

519
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:19,142
--Oh...

520
00:34:19,226 --> 00:34:20,435
It's okay, Holly.

521
00:34:20,519 --> 00:34:22,354
-It's just a loud noise.
-Nice.

522
00:34:24,064 --> 00:34:26,358
--Will!

523
00:34:28,443 --> 00:34:31,655
Better come out, buddy.
Will, where are ya?

524
00:34:41,999 --> 00:34:44,876
Hey, you think
Earl really saw Will?

525
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,921
I mean, what's he doin'
with a shaved head?

526
00:34:48,005 --> 00:34:49,590
And stealing food from Benny?

527
00:34:49,673 --> 00:34:52,342
Tell you what,
when we find him, we'll ask.

528
00:34:52,426 --> 00:34:54,052
Can't ask a corpse questions.

529
00:34:54,136 --> 00:34:55,929
--Hold up!

530
00:34:56,013 --> 00:34:57,472
You got something?

531
00:35:00,642 --> 00:35:02,769
- Hey, what do you got?
- Not sure.

532
00:35:02,853 --> 00:35:04,771
Maybe nothing.

533
00:35:04,855 --> 00:35:06,773
I found this. In there.

534
00:35:11,486 --> 00:35:13,655
No way a kid
crawls through there.

535
00:35:14,698 --> 00:35:16,408
I don't know...

536
00:35:16,491 --> 00:35:17,868
a scared enough one might.

537
00:35:17,951 --> 00:35:20,329
His brother said he was good at hiding.

538
00:35:56,448 --> 00:35:57,449
El?

539
00:36:03,246 --> 00:36:06,208
No adults.
Just us and some meatloaf.

540
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:12,798
Don't worry.
They won't tell anyone about you.

541
00:36:12,881 --> 00:36:15,300
They promise.
Right?

542
00:36:15,384 --> 00:36:17,928
We never would've upset you
if we knew you had superpowers.

543
00:36:19,262 --> 00:36:20,305
Ow!

544
00:36:20,389 --> 00:36:25,018
What Dustin is trying to say
is that they were just scared... earlier.

545
00:36:25,102 --> 00:36:26,144
That's all.

546
00:36:26,228 --> 00:36:28,146
We just wanted to find our friend.

547
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:29,773
"Friend"?

548
00:36:29,856 --> 00:36:32,734
Yeah, friend.
Will?

549
00:36:32,818 --> 00:36:36,113
What is "friend"?

550
00:36:36,196 --> 00:36:37,614
Is she serious?

551
00:36:40,283 --> 00:36:41,702
Um, a friend--

552
00:36:41,785 --> 00:36:43,537
Is someone that you'd do anything for.

553
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:46,748
You lend them your cool stuff,
like comic books and trading cards.

554
00:36:46,832 --> 00:36:48,125
And they never break a promise.

555
00:36:48,208 --> 00:36:50,127
-Especially when there's spit.
-Spit?

556
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:53,964
- A spit swear means...
- you never break your word.

557
00:36:54,047 --> 00:36:55,465
It's a bond.

558
00:36:55,549 --> 00:36:59,219
That's super important, because friends...

559
00:36:59,302 --> 00:37:01,555
they tell each other things.

560
00:37:01,638 --> 00:37:03,390
Things that parents don't know.

561
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:12,274
- Barbara, pull over.
- What?

562
00:37:12,357 --> 00:37:13,650
Pull over!

563
00:37:16,361 --> 00:37:18,238
What are we doing here?

564
00:37:18,321 --> 00:37:19,906
His house is three blocks away.

565
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:21,450
We can't park in the driveway.

566
00:37:21,533 --> 00:37:22,576
Are you serious?

567
00:37:22,659 --> 00:37:23,785
Yeah, the neighbors might see.

568
00:37:23,869 --> 00:37:26,580
This is so stupid.
I'm just gonna drop you off.

569
00:37:26,663 --> 00:37:28,498
Calm down, Barb.
Come on.

570
00:37:28,582 --> 00:37:31,126
You promised that you'd go.
You're coming.

571
00:37:31,209 --> 00:37:32,461
We're gonna have a great time.

572
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:34,087
He just wants to get in your pants.

573
00:37:34,171 --> 00:37:35,797
No, he doesn't.

574
00:37:35,881 --> 00:37:38,175
Nance... seriously.

575
00:37:39,301 --> 00:37:41,344
He invited you to his house.

576
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:43,346
His parents aren't home.

577
00:37:44,014 --> 00:37:45,682
Come on, you are not this stupid.

578
00:37:45,766 --> 00:37:47,768
Tommy H. and Carol are gonna be there.

579
00:37:47,851 --> 00:37:50,937
Tommy and Carol have been
having sex since, like, seventh grade.

580
00:37:51,938 --> 00:37:53,899
It'll probably just be, like, a big orgy.

581
00:37:53,982 --> 00:37:56,943
-Gross.
-I'm serious!

582
00:37:57,027 --> 00:37:58,320
All right, well...

583
00:37:59,321 --> 00:38:02,574
you can be, like, my guardian. All right?

584
00:38:02,657 --> 00:38:05,118
Make sure I don't get drunk
and do anything stupid.

585
00:38:05,202 --> 00:38:06,203
Ugh.

586
00:38:09,539 --> 00:38:10,749
Is that a new bra?

587
00:38:12,417 --> 00:38:13,543
No.

588
00:38:26,306 --> 00:38:27,974
Barb, chill.

589
00:38:28,892 --> 00:38:30,268
I'm chill.

590
00:38:35,357 --> 00:38:36,733
Hello, ladies.

591
00:39:08,849 --> 00:39:10,308
What are you doing?

592
00:39:11,309 --> 00:39:12,811
It's freezing.

593
00:39:18,692 --> 00:39:20,068
You ever feel cursed?

594
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:26,575
You know, the last person
to go missing here was in, uh...

595
00:39:28,368 --> 00:39:29,953
the summer of '23.

596
00:39:31,621 --> 00:39:33,915
The last suicide was the fall of '61.

597
00:39:39,212 --> 00:39:41,673
When'd the last person freeze to death?

598
00:39:45,176 --> 00:39:47,387
Hey, come back inside.

599
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:49,472
Warm me up. Just...

600
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,685
Just give me a minute out here.

601
00:40:20,378 --> 00:40:22,130
What's the weirdo doing?

602
00:40:28,178 --> 00:40:29,220
El?

603
00:40:42,817 --> 00:40:43,902
Will.

604
00:40:44,569 --> 00:40:45,570
Superpowers.

605
00:40:52,702 --> 00:40:55,622
Did you see him?
On Mirkwood?

606
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,249
Do you know where he is?

607
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,850
I don't understand.

608
00:41:16,768 --> 00:41:17,936
Hiding.

609
00:41:18,061 --> 00:41:19,688
Will is hiding?

610
00:41:24,442 --> 00:41:26,027
From the bad men?

611
00:41:28,947 --> 00:41:30,615
Then from who?

612
00:42:34,262 --> 00:42:35,805
Where are you?

613
00:43:04,876 --> 00:43:07,170
--One! Two!

614
00:43:07,253 --> 00:43:09,923
- Three!
- Stop it, Tommy, no! Don't!

615
00:43:10,006 --> 00:43:12,675
--You're such an asshole, Tommy.

616
00:43:27,899 --> 00:43:29,609
Is that supposed to impress me?

617
00:43:30,401 --> 00:43:33,488
-You're not?
-You are a cliché, you do realize that?

618
00:43:33,571 --> 00:43:34,614
You are a cliché.

619
00:43:34,697 --> 00:43:37,117
What with your...
your grades and your band practice.

620
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,618
I'm so not in band.

621
00:43:38,701 --> 00:43:41,621
Okay, party girl. Why don't you just, uh,
show us how it's done, then?

622
00:43:41,704 --> 00:43:42,705
Okay.

623
00:43:49,838 --> 00:43:51,756
-You gotta make a little hole right in--
-I got it.

624
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:54,050
Yeah, she's smart, you douche!

625
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,807
Chug, chug, chug.

626
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:02,350
Chug. Chug. Chug.

627
00:44:14,904 --> 00:44:16,156
Barb, you wanna try?

628
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:18,533
What? No.

629
00:44:18,616 --> 00:44:19,868
No, I don't want to. Thanks.

630
00:44:19,951 --> 00:44:21,077
- Come on.
- Yeah...

631
00:44:21,161 --> 00:44:22,495
- Come on. Yeah.
- Nance, I don't want to.

632
00:44:22,579 --> 00:44:24,289
-It's fun! Just give it a--
-Nance...

633
00:44:24,372 --> 00:44:26,040
Just... Just give it a shot.

634
00:44:28,251 --> 00:44:29,294
Okay.

635
00:44:34,883 --> 00:44:36,009
So you just...

636
00:44:40,722 --> 00:44:42,765
- Gnarly.
- Are you okay?

637
00:44:42,849 --> 00:44:44,309
- Yeah.
- Barb, you're bleeding.

638
00:44:44,392 --> 00:44:46,352
I'm fine.
Where's your bathroom?

639
00:44:46,436 --> 00:44:49,022
Oh, it's... It's, uh, down past
the kitchen, to the left.

640
00:44:49,105 --> 00:44:50,690
Okay. Thanks.

641
00:44:53,651 --> 00:44:55,194
Oh.

642
00:45:04,078 --> 00:45:07,206
Oh, my, God!
What the hell, Tommy?

643
00:45:07,290 --> 00:45:08,291
No!

644
00:45:09,918 --> 00:45:11,836
--Whoo!

645
00:45:52,001 --> 00:45:53,044
Hello?

646
00:45:55,254 --> 00:45:57,840
- Hello.

647
00:45:57,924 --> 00:45:59,759
Who is this?

648
00:46:02,845 --> 00:46:05,098
- Will?

649
00:46:06,557 --> 00:46:09,310
--Will, it's me.

650
00:46:09,394 --> 00:46:11,145
Talk to me.

651
00:46:11,229 --> 00:46:12,605
I'm here.

652
00:46:12,689 --> 00:46:14,565
Just tell me where you are, honey.

653
00:46:14,649 --> 00:46:16,609
- I can hear you. Please.

654
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:19,278
- Mom?

655
00:46:19,362 --> 00:46:20,738
Will!

656
00:46:20,822 --> 00:46:24,450
Yes, it's me.
It's me.

657
00:46:24,534 --> 00:46:26,828
Where are you? Where are you?
Just talk to me--

658
00:46:29,497 --> 00:46:30,540
Oh, no, no!

659
00:46:30,623 --> 00:46:31,666
No!

660
00:46:31,749 --> 00:46:33,251
No!

661
00:46:33,334 --> 00:46:36,045
Oh, no! No, no...

662
00:46:38,923 --> 00:46:40,216
No!

663
00:46:46,305 --> 00:46:48,182
No!

664
00:47:04,699 --> 00:47:06,075
Jonathan?

665
00:47:08,703 --> 00:47:09,704
What...

666
00:47:41,402 --> 00:47:42,445
Will...

667
00:47:54,624 --> 00:47:56,209
Will...

668
00:47:57,335 --> 00:47:59,003
Will, is that you?

669
00:48:22,276 --> 00:48:23,653
Oh, my God.

670
00:48:26,364 --> 00:48:27,949
Oh, God...

671
00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:33,037
Oh, my God...

672
00:49:17,248 --> 00:49:19,125
--I'm freezing.

673
00:49:19,208 --> 00:49:23,504
Hmm... well, I hear his
mom's room has a fireplace.

674
00:49:23,588 --> 00:49:24,839
- Are you kidding?
- Oh, yeah?

675
00:49:24,922 --> 00:49:27,258
Okay, well, you know,
you are cleaning the sheets.

676
00:49:27,341 --> 00:49:28,593
-You all right?
-Yeah.

677
00:49:28,676 --> 00:49:31,345
Yeah?
Come on, let's get you some dry clothes.

678
00:49:36,893 --> 00:49:38,186
Nance!

679
00:49:38,311 --> 00:49:39,604
Nancy.

680
00:49:40,563 --> 00:49:42,315
Where are you going?

681
00:49:42,398 --> 00:49:43,441
Nowhere.

682
00:49:43,524 --> 00:49:45,359
Just... upstairs.

683
00:49:45,443 --> 00:49:47,069
To change.

684
00:49:47,153 --> 00:49:49,906
I... fell in the pool.

685
00:49:52,658 --> 00:49:54,535
Why don't you go ahead and go home.

686
00:49:54,619 --> 00:49:56,996
I'll just... I'll get a ride or something.

687
00:49:57,079 --> 00:49:58,456
Nance...

688
00:49:59,207 --> 00:50:00,917
Barb...

689
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,585
I'm fine.

690
00:50:02,668 --> 00:50:05,087
This isn't you.

691
00:50:06,214 --> 00:50:07,840
I'm fine.

692
00:50:07,924 --> 00:50:11,510
Just... go ahead and go home, okay?

693
00:50:31,405 --> 00:50:32,657
Thanks.

694
00:50:37,453 --> 00:50:38,996
Um...

695
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:40,706
some privacy, maybe?

696
00:50:40,790 --> 00:50:42,291
Oh...

697
00:50:42,375 --> 00:50:44,001
Yeah, right.
Sorry.

698
00:50:48,756 --> 00:50:49,799
Steve?

699
00:51:03,813 --> 00:51:04,981
Damn.

700
00:51:07,316 --> 00:51:08,567
Shut up.
