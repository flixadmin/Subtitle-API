1
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,400
Well, you must be the B-team.

2
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,040
We just handle transpo.

3
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,480
Bob will be taking care of you.

4
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,920
- Bob?
- One of our top guys.

5
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:41,960
You're in good hands.

6
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,040
Good morning.

7
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,640
- You're up early.
- I haven't made it to bed yet.

8
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,240
Word is you got caught with
Doc Thompkins in the locker room.

9
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,520
Strictly business.

10
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,080
- Any word on Fish?
- No.

11
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,920
Club's all shot up. Blood everywhere.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,400
No sign of Fish.
It's her own damn fault.

13
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,760
She played the game,
she knew the risks.

14
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,520
Sorry, I know you have
a thing for her.

15
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,160
I don't got a thing for nobody.

16
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,320
My thing is for me.

17
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,000
If anyone can make it out
of a scrape like that, it's Fish.

18
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,400
The woman's nails.

19
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,640
Come on. We got a case.

20
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,200
Yeah. So, what do we got?

21
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,440
Public service homicide.
Vic's a douche.

22
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,120
Flass, Gordon. Gordon, Flass.

23
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,520
- Hi.
- Hey.

24
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,960
Flass works Narcotics.

25
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,200
Hence the bling
and the no doubt expensive yet

26
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,760
somehow cheap-looking Italian suit.

27
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,840
Bullock.

28
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,120
Still dressing in the dark and
smelling like a tap-house whore.

29
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,680
One of Flass's connections
tipped him off on the body.

30
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,600
Why don't you tell Gordon
about the kid.

31
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,480
Pinky Littlefield.

32
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,240
Dealer from a crew known
as the Uptown Assassins.

33
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,680
He works this block.

34
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,480
Well, at least he did.

35
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,680
- Any drugs on him?
- Didn't find any.

36
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,600
My big wild guess, deal gone bad.

37
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,840
Kid like this,
bound to happen sooner or later.

38
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,720
Like I said, public service homicide.

39
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,560
Well, boys, I've got another case
I've got to attend to.

40
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,560
So if you don't need
any more hand holding,

41
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,560
I'm gonna walk you out.

42
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,720
Hey, unis think they may have
found a witness. Night janitor.

43
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,440
They're bringing him over.

44
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,560
- Jim, Mr. Winkler.
- Sir.

45
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,720
No need for formalities.
Call me Leon.

46
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,760
Leon. We really appreciate you
stepping forward.

47
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,200
My wife Louisa always says if you
don't step forward, you step back.

48
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,960
She sounds like a smart lady.

49
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,160
Yeah. She is.

50
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,800
So, do I give a statement?
A description of the killer?

51
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,600
I'm not sure how this works.

52
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,560
Would you be willing to
come down to the precinct?

53
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,800
Work with a sketch artist?

54
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,960
That really is the best way
to catch the killer.

55
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,480
It'd be a huge help.

56
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,320
Yeah. Of course.

57
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,160
Thank you, sir.

58
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,760
Yes, sweetheart.
I'm still at the precinct.

59
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,280
I know. Of course. Yeah.

60
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,840
But, okay.

61
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,800
- They send in the sketch artist yet?
- No, not yet.

62
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,840
Louisa, I have to go. Bye-bye.

63
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,920
But you did see the killer, right?

64
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,200
Yes. That's what I told
the detectives earlier.

65
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,800
I'm sorry. Who are you?

66
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,480
How the hell did this happen?

67
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,240
Security cameras inside
and outside were turned off.

68
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,400
Ed, you got any thoughts
on the weapon?

69
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,160
What's strong enough to smash ships
but still fears the sun?

70
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,600
Can it with the riddles, Ed.

71
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,160
I don't have the patience today
or any day.

72
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,840
- Ice.
- Correct.

73
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,560
Gauging by the circumference
of the wounds,

74
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,360
I believe the weapon is an ice pick.

75
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,880
Carbon steel. Six inches long.

76
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,360
Driven in deep enough it
marked the surrounding tissue

77
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,120
with an imprint of a distinctive
hexagonal handle.

78
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,880
It's not your standard kitchen fare.

79
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,120
Fun fact, gentlemen.

80
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,920
Mr. Winkler's wounds here

81
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,480
are the exact same as the wounds
on the victim from this morning.

82
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,160
The drug dealer? Littlefield?

83
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,320
Him. Same weapon.
Same killer, one would suppose.

84
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,560
Damn it. Right in our house.

85
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,680
Okay. What is your name?

86
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,680
You know who I am.

87
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,560
It's just a formality.

88
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,520
I like to be sure.

89
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,360
Bob?

90
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,440
Is that short for Robert?

91
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,640
You have any family, Robert?

92
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,160
Two lovely daughters.

93
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,520
I'm putting you down
as Maria Mercedes Mooney, aka Fish.

94
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,360
We'll be extracting a very sincere
apology from you today.

95
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,720
Shouldn't take too long.

96
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,040
How old are your girls, Robert?

97
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,680
I bet you they're some
ugly little creatures.

98
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,760
Now, come on, Fish.

99
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,440
No call for rudeness.

100
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,240
Only my friends call me Fish,
darling.

101
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,960
And you and I, we're not friends...

102
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,520
yet.

103
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,400
You go get him.

104
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,400
I got to find the keys
to the incinerator.

105
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,280
Hey, Marco.

106
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,880
Where's Fish Mooney?

107
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,560
{\an5}How is anyone gonna trust us
to keep them safe?

108
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,480
{\an5}We can't protect people
in our own house.

109
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,720
{\an5}Upside is the place,
is crawling with criminals,

110
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,920
{\an5}so we got beaucoup suspects
to choose from.

111
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,200
That's an upside?

112
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,000
{\an5}Security cameras were turned off.

113
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,000
{\an5}Could've been a cop. Probably was.

114
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,960
{\an5}You do not even think
something like that.

115
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,320
{\an5}The second that those guys out there
hear that you're looking at a cop,

116
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,200
they are gonna turn on you.

117
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,160
Bullock's right.
You start pointing fingers.

118
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,680
You could jeopardize
your reinstatement.

119
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,360
{\an5}You need concrete evidence
to even think

120
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,040
{\an5}of accusing another officer
of murder.

121
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,800
{\an5}I'll start with the guard
duty logbook.

122
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,200
{\an5}- Jim.
- Winkler was my witness.

123
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,440
No way I'm letting this ride.

124
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,000
I asked him to come in here,
I'm gonna find his killer.

125
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,800
No matter who it is.

126
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,200
Proceed with caution.

127
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,400
Yes, ma'am.

128
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,160
No big moves without my say-so.

129
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,800
I do believe,

130
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,800
{\an5}this is the second time we've been
around this block, Master Bruce.

131
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,960
{\an5}Selina likes to hang out here.
It's worth doubling back.

132
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,840
{\an5}Besides, you got what you wanted.

133
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,520
{\an5}I went out of town like you asked.
For weeks.

134
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,720
{\an5}Yeah, well.
It wasn't safe here, was it?

135
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,880
{\an5}The assassins weren't after me.

136
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,280
{\an5}They were after her.

137
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,600
{\an5}Yeah, and we'll be back on that plane
straight back to the bloody Alps

138
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,400
{\an5}the first sign of trouble,
I tell you.

139
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,800
{\an5}Master Bruce. Master Bruce,
get back in the car now.

140
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,240
{\an5}Can we walk around
the block just once?

141
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,360
{\an5}Then, I'll get back in the car.

142
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,680
{\an5}Please, Alfred.

143
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,440
{\an5}Once around the block and then home.

144
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,520
{\an5}Thank you.

145
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,160
{\an5}Got the rest of your life like that

146
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,080
{\an5}to get whipped into a frenzy
by the females.

147
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,160
{\an5}I don't know why you want
to start now.

148
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,280
{\an5}It's not like that.

149
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,440
{\an5}Out of my way.

150
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,680
{\an5}Ivy?

151
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,160
{\an5}Steady, Master Bruce.
Looks like she's got the mange.

152
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,840
{\an5}Look who it is?
Billionaire Bruce Wayne.

153
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,840
Who are you, his bodyguard?

154
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,200
If needs be, miss, yes.

155
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,720
What's in the bag?

156
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,120
It's for Selina.

157
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,360
{\an5}- Have you seen her?
- Sure.

158
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,760
{\an5}I can give it to her if you want.

159
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,840
{\an5}Perhaps you could pass
on a message for me.

160
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,880
Tell her I'm looking for her.

161
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,080
Twenty bucks.

162
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,200
{\an5}Alfred.

163
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,800
Twenty bucks.

164
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,960
There we are, miss.

165
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,800
Delightful friends you have,
Master Bruce.

166
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,160
Home.

167
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,440
That's all you got?

168
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,000
You are gonna bore me to death,
fella.

169
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,640
That's impressive. Different strokes?

170
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,440
You know, me,
I can't stand hot spicy food,

171
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,360
but my wife, you know, she loves it.

172
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,720
Hotter the better.

173
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,520
Now, where, oh, where
are we gonna begin?

174
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,080
Now, taking off a hand,
that's devastating.

175
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,840
But I've found
that taking out a knee.

176
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,960
You okay, Fish?

177
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,560
A page is missing from this logbook.

178
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,880
Now that in and of itself is grounds
for dismissal from the force.

179
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,960
So my question to you is:

180
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,640
Who was on guard duty outside
of interrogation this morning?

181
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,960
No idea, man.

182
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,440
Nobody's talking.

183
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,640
They're protecting their own.

184
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,480
- Or they just don't like you.
- Face it, Harvey.

185
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,960
Leon Winkler's killer is a cop.

186
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,400
Not proven.

187
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,960
Come on, you know these guys.

188
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,200
You've known them since way back.

189
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,280
Give me some leverage.
Give me an angle.

190
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,040
You really want to work
with a murderer?

191
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,840
Somebody gets whacked in the GCPD.

192
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,280
Somebody's gonna get fired for this.

193
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,440
Not me, pal.

194
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,800
Grover.

195
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,560
We got a reliable guy,

196
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,400
says it was you pulled the page
from the guard duty logbook.

197
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,760
No way. Where did you get that?

198
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,920
- Who said that?
- Alvarez.

199
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,760
If he said that,
that son of a bitch is lying.

200
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,080
Why would he lie?

201
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,520
Look. Six years ago,
I had a thing with his wife, okay?

202
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,560
Six years ago.
He is a vindictive bastard.

203
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,000
Well, look,
that's none of our business, huh?

204
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,600
Look at it from our point of view.

205
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,880
We got to find the culprit.

206
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,080
Brass demands one.

207
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,640
But it wasn't me.

208
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,600
Then who was it?

209
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,280
Delaware? Anybody seen Delaware?

210
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,640
Saw him go to the garage.

211
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,800
Hey. Delaware! Hey!

212
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,440
Hey!

213
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,240
You're gonna regret that.

214
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,480
You were guarding interrogation
this morning, weren't you?

215
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,840
Screw off.

216
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,080
Hey!

217
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,600
Hey.

218
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,520
Jim.

219
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,280
What the hell are you doing?

220
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,720
You couldn't bring him in here
quietly, put him in some back room?

221
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,640
You making some kind of statement?

222
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,960
Damn, right I am.

223
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,040
I warned you and you didn't listen.

224
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,480
I have evidence.

225
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,000
The same drugs I found
in Littlefield's shoe

226
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,600
at the crime scene yesterday morning.

227
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,320
That evidence is part of an ongoing
undercover Narco investigation.

228
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,760
You expect us to believe that?

229
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,960
Jim, Narco's been knee-deep
in the uptown drug trade for months.

230
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,680
I've got a matrix of undercovers

231
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,760
that have put their lives at stake
for this investigation.

232
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,320
Your little stunt gets out,
you unravel the whole operation.

233
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,480
Not to mention,
the search was illegal.

234
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,240
So we're ignoring Delaware's
involvement in Winkler's death?

235
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,320
Is that what we're doing, Capt?

236
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,240
No, but this isn't the way, Jim.

237
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,040
I'm turning over the case
to Internal Affairs.

238
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,560
I.A.? Two old drunks in the basement?

239
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:56,640
You and Bullock are no longer
investigating the Winkler murder.

240
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,040
What about the Littlefield murder?

241
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:02,000
Or, wait, is that also a part
of an ongoing narco investigation?

242
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,760
All you, buddy.

243
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,480
Let me know if you need any help.

244
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,000
I'm sorry about the confusion.

245
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,240
Can I help you with something?

246
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,800
Did you know, Miss Kringle,

247
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,640
that the earliest greeting cards
dated back to Germany in the 1400s?

248
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,320
I have a lot of work to do.

249
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,640
This is for you.

250
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,760
Doesn't say anything weird, does it?

251
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,840
No, ma'am.

252
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,840
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

253
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,920
Take it easy. Take it easy.

254
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,200
I'm fine, Butch.

255
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,200
Here. Try this.

256
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,840
- You okay?
- I'm starving.

257
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,280
You are one tough cookie.

258
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,680
Thank you, Butch.

259
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,080
Listen, we should hit the road.

260
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,640
I figure we've got about
an hour before Falcone.

261
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,360
Oh, I'm not going anywhere
until I find Penguin.

262
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,440
He's the one that told Falcone
about Liza.

263
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,840
Whoa, whoa, whoa, boss,
I don't know if you remember,

264
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,840
but as of last night,
we don't have any men.

265
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,000
Falcone's gonna have the whole city
looking for us.

266
00:16:55,080 --> 00:17:01,080
I'm not going anywhere
until I cut Penguin's throat!

267
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:07,160
One, two, three.

268
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,680
What do you think, Mother?

269
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,320
Oh, it's beautiful.

270
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,520
Oh, so classy.

271
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,200
Like an opera house.

272
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:39,680
Oh! A chandelier.

273
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,600
Like home.

274
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,760
Someone left a scarf.

275
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,160
It's beautiful with my dress.

276
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,200
Finders keepers.

277
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:00,920
And now, you are in charge
of this club?

278
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,360
Spoiled my surprise.

279
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,480
No. Oh, no, no, <i>liebchen</i>.

280
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,400
No, don't be angry. No.

281
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,760
Such good news.

282
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,120
My boy has a club.

283
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,320
Will have a club.

284
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,640
There's still a few loose ends
to tie up,

285
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,880
but soon it will be mine.

286
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:26,440
I am so proud of you.

287
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,080
I could spit.

288
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,880
Listen, Jim, there's something
I got to tell you.

289
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,920
A few years ago, Flass and his people
started busting drug dealers,

290
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,240
taking over their stash houses,
running them themselves.

291
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,680
Now? You tell me this now?

292
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,080
Look, I respond to crises
as they arise.

293
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,160
I'm not a forward planner like you.
I didn't tell you then

294
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,480
because I didn't want to get you
all riled you up,

295
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,760
but I'm telling you now
because I want you to stop.

296
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,840
Flass is protected.

297
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,880
By who?

298
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,760
Serious people.

299
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,320
Really high up. Big money.

300
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,440
For all I know, the commissioner
gets a piece too.

301
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,400
You mess with Flass,
you can forget going back to Arkham.

302
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,400
These guys do not play.

303
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,040
These stash houses, think you can get
me a location on them?

304
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,800
Did you not hear a word I just said?

305
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,760
The stash houses
could give us evidence

306
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,400
linking Flass to Littlefield's
murder.

307
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,680
We nail him for Littlefield,
we can nail him for Winkler.

308
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,520
- Jim.
- I can't let it be, Harvey.

309
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,160
You should know that by now.

310
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,560
Mick, it's Harv.

311
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,760
You know that thing you
and Donnie were working on?

312
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,960
The Flass thing?

313
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,800
I need your help.

314
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,040
- Prime spot for a stash house.
- Yeah.

315
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,120
Delaware.

316
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,920
Hand over the boxes.

317
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,880
You don't learn, do you?

318
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,000
Get out of my face.

319
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,960
Hey. Hey!

320
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,160
No need to rough each other up,
gentlemen.

321
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,640
I got a warrant.

322
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,480
Giving us the legal right
to search and seizure.

323
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,360
It seems this warehouse
was being used as a home base

324
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,680
by the Uptown Assassins.

325
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,360
You expect us
to believe you got a signed warrant

326
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,600
to clear your own stash house?

327
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,320
On the commissioner's request.

328
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:09,160
Signed by Judge Bam-Bam.

329
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,560
Guess you don't have
a leg to stand on.

330
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,840
"Homicide."

331
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,960
- So, what's our next step?
- Next step?

332
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:31,680
We got nothing to tie Flass
to the drugs or the murders.

333
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,600
Murder. Just one.

334
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:38,440
Internal Affairs just ruled Winkler's
death as a suicide.

335
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,440
They're releasing the body
to his wife.

336
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,520
Leon was so very happy.

337
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,880
This just can't be right. Can't be...

338
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,400
A suicide?

339
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,160
He stabbed himself in the back
with an ice pick? That's absurd!

340
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,800
A ruling this quick means
the commissioner was involved.

341
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,160
Screw the commissioner.

342
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,280
Going forward with this
puts all of our jobs at risk.

343
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,680
Look, I want to help you, Jim.

344
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,000
There are people here in GCPD
who want to help you.

345
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,840
- So why don't they?
- They have. I have.

346
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,000
And we learned the hard way.

347
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,440
With men like Flass,
you need more than words.

348
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,840
You need results.

349
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,480
And that's not gonna happen
this time around.

350
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:26,560
So, do us all a favor
and move on to the next vic.

351
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,800
Please.

352
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,960
Where you going?

353
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,400
Back in an hour.

354
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,160
- Listen to this. This is classic.
- Stop it.

355
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,360
Hey, come on.

356
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,000
<i>"Dear Miss Kringle,
your eyes are as green as a meadow.</i>

357
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,440
<i>Your smile is as bright as the sun.</i>

358
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,560
<i>Your skin is as white as a snowflake.</i>

359
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,120
<i>It seems like your life is fun."</i>

360
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,040
- Really?
- Oh, hey!

361
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,360
It's the writer himself.

362
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,680
It's a real piece of work
you got there, perv.

363
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,520
I wouldn't quit your day job
if I were you.

364
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,400
Roger, dodger.

365
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,960
- Roger, dodger?
- Stop it.

366
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,040
What a creep.

367
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:46,560
One, two, three. One, two, three.

368
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,000
One.

369
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,120
Now. Now, you are getting it.

370
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,840
You are so graceful
for such a big man.

371
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,200
Isn't he graceful, Oswald?

372
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,720
Yes, Mother.

373
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,680
Jim.

374
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,280
Welcome.

375
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,480
Come in.

376
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:18,760
Another handsome man at the party.

377
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,960
I am so lucky.

378
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,560
This is Jim Gordon,

379
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,840
the detective friend
I was telling you about.

380
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:30,840
Oh. So nice to meet
a friend of Oswald's.

381
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,640
I am Gertrud Kapelput.

382
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,040
Nice to meet you too, Mrs. Kapelput.

383
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,240
Mother, Jim
and I have very important business.

384
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,080
No. Oh, sad. Oh, no, sad.

385
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,480
A little soon to be celebrating,
don't you think?

386
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,520
Well, don't just stand there. Sit.

387
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,240
This won't take long.

388
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,240
I insist. Sit.

389
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,160
I'm so very glad you called,
Jim Gordon.

390
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,520
It's been far too long
since we've seen each other.

391
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,120
I was beginning to think
you'd forgotten about me.

392
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,880
I need a favor.

393
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,840
Do you know anything
about a narcotics detective

394
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,520
by the name of Arnold Flass?

395
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,760
I've heard the name.

396
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,600
I'm investigating him
and his crew for murder,

397
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,760
but I've hit a wall.

398
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,360
He's too well-connected.

399
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,800
I figured since Maroni runs
the drug trade

400
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:28,560
maybe you could find somebody
with the goods on Flass? But...

401
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,360
Say no more.

402
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,560
Favor is done. I'll make some calls.

403
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,640
And what do I owe you in return?

404
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,160
Friends don't owe friends, silly.

405
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,120
They just do favors
because they want to.

406
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,000
Because they're friends.

407
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,160
Nobody gets hurt.

408
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,680
Of course. No one gets hurt.

409
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,320
Champagne?

410
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,160
Oh, dear me.

411
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,200
What happened here?

412
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,960
Call Falcone.

413
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,480
No kidding?

414
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,040
Thank you. Thank you, boys. Lovely.

415
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,120
No. I am dancing still.

416
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,480
- You may go.
- Oh, why you make them go?

417
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:45,320
Gabe, on your way to help
my dear friend Jim,

418
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,560
could you be a gentleman
and take Mother home?

419
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,640
Sure thing, boss.

420
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,440
Come on, Mrs. K.

421
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,000
A palace.

422
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,840
My boy has a palace.

423
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,760
Such a good boy.

424
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,640
Don't worry.

425
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,160
I will be back.

426
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,440
<i>I wanna be somebody else today</i>

427
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,160
<i>I wanna take my shoes out it</i>

428
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:43,600
<i>Ain't like me to complain
But it just feels like I'm losing</i>

429
00:27:54,440 --> 00:28:00,320
Ladies and gentlemen, friends,
celebrities from around the world,

430
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:04,040
my name is Oswald Cobblepot.

431
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,320
Here we are at last.

432
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,680
It is with deep and sincere pleasure

433
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:14,160
that I bid you welcome
to the official grand opening

434
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,960
of my newest night spot, the...

435
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,000
Not bad.

436
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,880
I do believe you need
to project more.

437
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,480
Just to create a bit more excitement
for the audience.

438
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:36,520
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Fish Mooney's.

439
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,000
Like that.

440
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:01,200
What kind of weirdo plays chess
with himself?

441
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,480
Don't you have a butler to do
that kind of stuff with you?

442
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,400
He's making lunch.

443
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,640
I got your message.

444
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,240
I'm glad you're safe.

445
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,720
Alfred made me go out of town.

446
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,560
Switzerland. We have a house there.

447
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,200
Chalet, I guess.

448
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,520
A chalet?

449
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,080
It's basically a house.

450
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,600
Why did you want to see me?

451
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,280
We're friends, aren't we?

452
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:29,360
You've been driving around
looking for me.

453
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,120
Sending messages. What's up?

454
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,600
I got you a present.

455
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,240
It looks like the town we stayed in.

456
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Whoa!

457
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,880
Thank you.

458
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,520
Also, I wanted to know if...

459
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,520
if you wanted to stay here
in my house.

460
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,920
Why?

461
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,320
I figure we can help each other out.

462
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,240
You can help me find the man
who killed my parents

463
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,680
and I can give you
a better place to live.

464
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,560
What's better about it?

465
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,760
Listen, kid. Chill.

466
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,960
I came here to tell you to stop
hassling me.

467
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,560
- Hassling you?
- Yeah.

468
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,240
You're beginning to bug me.

469
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,800
I thought we were friends.

470
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,480
Listen, I lied.

471
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:49,680
I didn't see who killed your parents.
I didn't see his face.

472
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,840
I don't understand.

473
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,320
I lied so I wouldn't get locked up
in juvie.

474
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,800
So, it's no use buying me presents,

475
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,880
or sending me messages,
or trying to hang out.

476
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,400
There's no point
because I can't help you.

477
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,760
Pinky Littlefield was light
two weeks running.

478
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,520
If you don't pay up,
there's consequences.

479
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,320
Flass killed him to send a message.

480
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,360
But please, please!
I swear that's all I know.

481
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,000
- You sure?
- I swear, man, I swear!

482
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,640
I believe you.

483
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,360
But I think I'll need something
a bit more tangible.

484
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,840
No, no, no! Please, no!
No! No! Please, no!

485
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,600
I swear, man! I swear!

486
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,960
How are you liking show business now?

487
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,640
Please, Miss Mooney.
You're making a mistake.

488
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:51,600
I... I beg of you, let me speak.

489
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,920
I know we've had our differences.

490
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,840
We could combine our forces.

491
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,120
Think how'd we fool everyone.

492
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,480
Me work with you?

493
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,680
I found you.

494
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,200
I made you!

495
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:14,040
When you walked in here,
you were a sad little wannabe.

496
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:18,160
Remember that, Butch?
You were so afraid.

497
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,320
Shook like a leaf in fall.

498
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,440
You're a servant.

499
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,760
An umbrella boy.

500
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,680
You're a nobody.

501
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:34,960
This nobody still outfoxed you
at every turn.

502
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,120
I was working for Falcone
the whole time!

503
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,960
And you didn't have
the sense to see it!

504
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:51,640
Hello. Seems like Mooney's
is the place to be today.

505
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,280
- Come on, come on!
- No!

506
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,800
Come on!

507
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,800
Go, go, go!

508
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,080
Here.

509
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,880
You got to go!

510
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,400
I'll slow them down!

511
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,960
- No, no!
- Go!

512
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,440
Hello, again.

513
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,840
Where is she?

514
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:35,160
What do you think, girls?
Should we kill him...

515
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,560
or should we take him home
to play with?

516
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,840
Mr. Nygma?

517
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,120
Miss Kringle?

518
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,680
- Am I interrupting?
- Yes.

519
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,680
I'm surgically removing
the onions from my takeout,

520
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,920
so if you don't mind...

521
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,600
Mr. Nygma, I owe you an apology.

522
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,200
I didn't give Arnold the card.

523
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,240
He found it in my desk.

524
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:25,320
He has a strange sense of humor.

525
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,560
I thought your card was very...

526
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,400
thoughtful.

527
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:36,800
I guess. Anyway, I'm sorry.

528
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,120
- Miss Kringle, would you...
- No, no, no.

529
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,200
Please, don't say anything else.
Just, please.

530
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,320
There's hope.

531
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,120
What's this?

532
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,680
Murder weapon and a tape
of Delaware rolling on Flass.

533
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,600
Smart cookie, that one.

534
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,080
Flass gave me the ice pick
to throw away.

535
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,440
Delaware kept it in case
he had to cover his own ass.

536
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,600
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

537
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,760
Master Bruce?

538
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,680
She was lying.

539
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,920
Oh.

540
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,720
I see.

541
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,680
Shall I get a broom then?

542
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:04,280
Or would you rather continue crying
over the shattered fragments

543
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:07,040
of your young dreams?

544
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:18,200
Yes, Alfred. A broom.

545
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,240
Very good, Master Bruce.

546
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,240
I'll find other leads.

547
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,800
No doubt.

548
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,000
I knew she was a wrong one.

549
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,680
Arnold Flass!

550
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,600
You're under arrest for the murder
of Leon Winkler.

551
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,760
Keep walking, mutt. You got nothing.

552
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,920
That's 20 years upstate right there.

553
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,920
Delaware gave you up.

554
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,360
Jimbo, you really think these guys
are gonna let you arrest me?

555
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,800
These are my friends.

556
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,840
- This is my house.
- This is not your house.

557
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,560
You're a drug dealer and a murderer.

558
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,920
You don't belong here.

559
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,440
You don't deserve the badge.

560
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,400
You believe this crap?

561
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,200
How long you been here?
A few months?

562
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,200
Why don't you come preach to me
in five years?

563
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,480
He murdered Leon Winkler!

564
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,240
An innocent man who trusted us!

565
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,560
Who trusted this!

566
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,280
<i>- That's right.
- Yeah.</i>

567
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,960
Enough to step forward
and help us solve a case.

568
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,800
A man who died so Detective Flass
could protect himself.

569
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,360
I.A. ruled it a suicide.

570
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,280
I'm arresting this man.

571
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,720
Get real, dumb-ass. I'm protected.

572
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,880
You can help me or you can try
and stop me.

573
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,240
Either way, I'm doing my duty.

574
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,200
Hey, back off, all right?
I'm protected! Get out of here.

575
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,480
Shut up, Flass.

576
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,600
Arnold Flass,
you're under arrest for murder.

577
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,640
The hell do you think you're doing?
Are you crazy?

578
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,600
Read him his rights.

579
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,320
You have the right to remain silent.

580
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,280
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

581
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,960
You can't keep me in here!

582
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,120
- You have the right to an attorney.
- Do you know how many people I got?

583
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:49,760
<i>- If you cannot afford one...
- You don't know me. You got nothing!</i>

584
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,160
Thanks, Cap.

585
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,920
Here.

586
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,280
So, what's the plan?

587
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,560
I'm gonna leave town,
lay low for a while.

588
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,720
But then I'm gonna come back
and kill Penguin...

589
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,720
when the time is right.

590
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:39,320
Listen, you know,
I have your best interests at heart.

591
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,440
- Don't come back.
- No.

592
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,200
You will see me again.

593
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,080
And in the meantime, do me a favor.

594
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,560
Find Butch.

595
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,360
And if he's alive, help him.

596
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,600
I will.

597
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,080
See you soon.

598
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,960
Be good.

599
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,240
Always.

600
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,880
- Good night.
- Night, Detective.

601
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,120
Yo.

602
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,400
That big guy visit you?

603
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,800
- Give you the package I sent?
- Yeah.

604
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,200
Thanks. That was...

605
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,320
Yo, this... so this means we're even?

606
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,280
I ratted out Flass like you wanted.

607
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,880
So now you back off, right?

608
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,240
Nothing more is gonna happen
to my wife?

609
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,520
She's safe? My family's safe?

610
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,320
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

611
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,680
Okay, okay! No worries.

612
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:09,360
Look, never mind I pressed.

613
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,160
I won't say nothing to no one.

614
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:14,120
I'll... I'll... I'll pretend this
conversation never happened.

615
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,680
Okay? Just...

616
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:19,440
keep my wife and kids out of it.

617
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,240
I'm... I'm begging you.

618
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,480
Please.

619
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,320
Please!

620
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,640
Please!
