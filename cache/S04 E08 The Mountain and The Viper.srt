1
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:17,512
Here we are.

2
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:26,938
Ready?

3
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:34,237
The rains of castamere.

4
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:36,156
You fucking deaf?

5
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,742
Same wrong guess every fucking time.

6
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,369
Listen, you cunt.

7
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:42,037
All: Oh!

8
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,250
The bear and the maiden fair.

9
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:50,837
- Yes!
- There's a man with an ear.

10
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:53,674
Too bad you got a hangnail for a cock.

11
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:59,096
First time I saw you with your breeches
down, I thought you were a eunuch.

12
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,515
You've seen it, girls.

13
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:04,643
Like a baby snail peeking out of its shell.

14
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,951
Your baby was crying this morning.

15
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,291
Woke me up.

16
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:31,586
- You hear me?
- Yes.

17
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:34,715
Well, got anything to say?

18
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:36,758
I'm sorry.

19
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:40,679
I don't care if you're sorry.

20
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:44,224
Keep that baby quiet, or I will.

21
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,226
Don't you ever touch him.

22
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,272
Little wildling bitch.

23
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:53,400
You should have stayed with your own kind.

24
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:58,280
- Are you listening to me?
- Shut your mouth.

25
00:03:58,363 --> 00:03:59,781
What?

26
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:04,161
It's just an owl, you dumb bitch.

27
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,746
No, it's not.

28
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:46,763
Shh.

29
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,064
I should never have left her there.

30
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:59,651
- You couldn't have known.
- Of course I could've.

31
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,362
They've been raiding the villages close by.

32
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,906
And we just cower in here
while they slaughter our brothers.

33
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,992
Our brothers had orders
to stay at castle black.

34
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,076
So it's all right, then?

35
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:11,663
Black Jack and kegs and mully chopped
to pieces 'cause they broke the rules?

36
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:15,041
I didn't say it was all right.
I'm saying they shouldn't have been there.

37
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,085
We're pledged to guard the realms of men.

38
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,587
She's dead because of me.

39
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,171
We can't even guard mole's town.

40
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:22,215
We can't go after them. You know that.

41
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:23,341
It's what they want.

42
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:25,760
Samwell: And little Sam.

43
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:28,847
As if I cut their throats myself.

44
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:30,332
Maybe she managed to hide herself.

45
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,225
I thought all of you was dead.

46
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:34,603
You went up north with mormont
and no one came back.

47
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:36,646
Not for ages.

48
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,273
But then you did.

49
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:44,237
She survived craster,
and he was the worst shit I've ever met.

50
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:46,197
She survived the long march to the wall.

51
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:49,701
She survived a white
Walker, for fuck's sake.

52
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,454
She might have got out.

53
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,167
She might have.

54
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:01,504
If they hit mole's town,

55
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:03,506
then we're next.

56
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:08,261
Mance and his army must be close.

57
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:09,679
Grenn: 100,000 of them.

58
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:12,307
And there's what, 105 of us left?

59
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:14,935
You counting black Jack, kegs, and mully?

60
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,146
102.

61
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:21,274
How do 102 men stop 100,000?

62
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,905
Whoever dies last,

63
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:30,408
be a good lad and burn the rest of us.

64
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:33,119
Once I'm done with this world,

65
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:35,372
I don't want to come back.

66
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,601
Daenerys: You think he was spying on you?

67
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:40,186
Missandei: No, not spying.

68
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:43,732
Daenerys: The Dothraki think outsiders are
ridiculous taking shame in the naked body.

69
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:46,985
They make love under the stars
for the whole khalasar to see.

70
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,989
Yes, your grace.

71
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:53,324
But you are not Dothraki.

72
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:58,371
Well, I don't see why it matters.

73
00:08:58,455 --> 00:08:59,831
Grey worm isn't interested.

74
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:02,167
None of the unsullied care
what's under our clothes.

75
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,630
He was interested.

76
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:09,799
What?

77
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,637
I believe he was interested.

78
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:20,310
When the slavers castrate the boys,
do they take all of it?

79
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,146
All of it?

80
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:27,609
The pillar and the stones.

81
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,489
I don't know, your grace.

82
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:34,824
Haven't you ever wondered?

83
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:40,914
Yes, your grace.

84
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:00,141
Grey worm: Missandei.

85
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:06,815
I have come to apologise.

86
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:09,067
You don't need to apologise.

87
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:11,861
I hope I didn't frighten you.

88
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,868
The lessons you give I in common tongue,

89
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:23,790
these are precious to I.

90
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,000
- "To me."
- To me.

91
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:28,795
I don't remember
teaching you the word "precious."

92
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,965
Jorah the andal, he teaches I...

93
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,551
He teaches me this word.

94
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:38,513
Do you remember the name
you were given at birth?

95
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,974
I remember nothing.

96
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,309
Only unsullied.

97
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,395
When they cut you,

98
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:47,522
do you remember that?

99
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:51,985
I'm sorry.

100
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:55,113
- I'm sorry they did that to you.
- Why?

101
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,240
Why sorry?

102
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:00,034
It's a terrible thing to do to a boy.

103
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:07,750
If the masters never out me,

104
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,419
I never am unsullied.

105
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,922
I never stand in the Plaza of pride

106
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:16,384
when Daenerys stormborn orders us
to kill the masters.

107
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:21,014
I never am chosen to lead the unsullied.

108
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:25,852
I never meet missandei
from the island of naath.

109
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,537
I am sorry I...

110
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,582
For today,

111
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,210
I am sorry.

112
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,594
Grey worm.

113
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:07,810
I'm glad you saw me.

114
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:11,856
So am I.

115
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,423
Ramsay: Kraken.

116
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:41,678
Mmm. Strong, as long as they're in the sea.

117
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:45,098
When you take them out of the water,
no bones.

118
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:50,270
They collapse under their proud weight
and slump into a heap of nothing.

119
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:52,355
You'd think they'd know that.

120
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,108
Unfortunately, they're not very bright.

121
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,360
What do you tell them?

122
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:00,947
I'm theon greyjoy, son of balon,

123
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,283
heir to the iron islands.

124
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:06,577
- And what are you really?
- I'm reek.

125
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,038
Are you sure?

126
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:12,250
You do look very much like a lord.

127
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:15,586
Formidable, proud.

128
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:18,256
I'm reek.

129
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,049
Until when?

130
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,635
Always.

131
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:23,886
- Forever.
- That's right.

132
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,724
Until you're rotting in the ground.

133
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:35,356
Remember what you are and what you're not.

134
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,734
Bring me moat cailin.

135
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,057
No closer.

136
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,519
Who are you?

137
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,644
I'm kenning,

138
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:57,230
commander of this Garrison.

139
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,400
And you say you're theon greyjoy?

140
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:02,151
Yes.

141
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:06,072
And why should I believe that?

142
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,990
I was born on pyke to balon greyjoy.

143
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:11,244
His third and last living son.

144
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,079
I am your prince.

145
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,289
I swear it by the drowned god.

146
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:17,583
What is dead may never die.

147
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,585
Men: What is dead may never die.

148
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:22,213
And if you were my prince,

149
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:24,257
why are you marching with a Bolton army?

150
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,343
Lord Bolton took me
captive after winterfell.

151
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:31,347
He sent me to treat with you in good faith
as your fellow ironborn.

152
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:33,141
And what does lord Bolton want?

153
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:38,396
You are fading from sickness,

154
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:41,899
you are badly outnumbered,
and you're hundreds of miles from the sea.

155
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:44,152
Lord Bolton implores
you to protect your men

156
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:47,947
and abandon this fortress
you can no longer hold.

157
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:52,994
Do this, and he will bejust and
fair with you as he has been with me.

158
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:58,207
The boltons will give you
safe passage to the stony shore.

159
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,626
He wants us to surrender?

160
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,713
My own father, your king,

161
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,632
surrendered years ago to Robert Baratheon.

162
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:09,135
Iwatched him bend the knee.

163
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,344
There was no shame there.

164
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:13,389
He fought with honour, as did you.

165
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:19,520
"No shame."
"Fought with honour."

166
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:21,105
I'm sorry, I didn't hear.

167
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:26,694
"No shame." "Fought with honour."

168
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,325
Only a whipped dog would speak this way.

169
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:36,037
Or a woman.

170
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:39,916
Are you a woman, boy?

171
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,334
You don't know...

172
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,336
The ironborn will not surrender.

173
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,254
My name is reek...

174
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:49,634
You go tell your master
that, theon greyjoy,

175
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,677
or whoever the fuck you are.

176
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:53,513
Reek.

177
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:55,932
- What in the hell are you muttering?
- Reek.

178
00:16:58,309 --> 00:16:59,810
Reek.

179
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,694
If we yield, we live?

180
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:11,447
- Is that what it says on this paper here?
- Yes.

181
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,234
Have your men raise the white flag
and open the gates.

182
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:18,246
You're going home.

183
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:26,629
Ramsay: You didn't really think
I'd let them go, did you?

184
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:30,508
It's fallen out of fashion, flaying.

185
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,635
Sad, but true.

186
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,720
Traditions are important.

187
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:37,640
Where are we without our history? Eh?

188
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:39,809
Yes, my lord.

189
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:42,687
Will we go home now?

190
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:45,273
I believe we will.

191
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:47,316
To our new home.

192
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,496
Royce: You have foreign blood,
don't you, baelish?

193
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:04,083
A great-grandfather from braavos, yes.

194
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:08,838
I suppose all of our ancestors
came from somewhere else originally.

195
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:12,425
Royce: Our forebears settled the vale
thousands of years ago.

196
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,510
We've fought off invaders ever since.

197
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:19,181
The beauty of the vale is matched
only by the nobility of its great families.

198
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:23,519
Lady arryn often told me that
you were her rock, lord Royce.

199
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:26,731
She told me nothing about you, baelish.

200
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:29,150
But I didn't need to hear from her.

201
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,027
Moneylender. Whoremonger.

202
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:34,238
You've been licking
tywin Lannister's boots so long,

203
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:36,174
- it's a wonder your tongue's not black.
- My lord...

204
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:40,411
And when Jon arryn named you
master of coin, no one cared.

205
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:43,789
Always been a grubbyjob.
Why not let a grubby man do it?

206
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:46,959
But when I heard you were lurking here,

207
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:50,671
- fawning over the lady arryn...
- Lady arryn invited me.

208
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,382
She and I have been close since childhood.

209
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:56,052
Yes, we all know how close you were.

210
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,888
Lady arryn's predilections
were her own affair.

211
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,598
Her death is our affair.

212
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:03,434
Of course. Her suicide shattered us all.

213
00:19:04,185 --> 00:19:07,480
She was an odd fish. Everyone knew that.

214
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:08,731
But suicide?

215
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:12,068
She adored that boy of hers.

216
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,654
I don't see her abandoning him.
Not by choice.

217
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,823
Royce: Strange that within days
of your arrival,

218
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:19,867
you've married lady arryn

219
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,161
and she's fallen through the moon door.

220
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:25,039
She was always prone to melancholy.

221
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:28,125
My lady wasn't meant for a world
as brutal as ours.

222
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:29,919
We were told there was a witness. A girl.

223
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,088
A niece of yours, I believe.

224
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,717
A girl with no learning and scattered wits.

225
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:38,153
I assure you, she would be of no help.

226
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,970
We'd like to speak with her.

227
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:45,059
- Let me fetch her.
- Anya: No need.

228
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:47,978
We prefer to
hear her testimony unadulterated.

229
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,533
Come closer, child.

230
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:04,537
You have nothing to fear from us or him.

231
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:08,374
Lord baelish here is your uncle?

232
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:09,709
Your name is alayne?

233
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:15,047
Perhaps you would feel more comfortable
if lord baelish left the room.

234
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:16,549
- My lady...
- I wasn't asking you.

235
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:17,675
He can stay.

236
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:19,719
Speak up, girl,
you're not a damn kitchen mouse.

237
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:20,803
Tell us what you saw.

238
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:27,476
I'm sorry, lord baelish.

239
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,019
I have to tell the truth.

240
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,318
I'll tell you everything.

241
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:40,197
Please, alayne, leave nothing out.

242
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:45,327
My name is not alayne.

243
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:46,704
It's sansa stark,

244
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:49,749
eldest daughter of lord Eddard stark.

245
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,418
Lord Royce,
we met when you came to winterfell.

246
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:56,088
You were escorting your son ser waymar
to the wall.

247
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:58,007
Sansa stark?

248
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:02,261
You tell lies right to
my face, you little worm?

249
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:05,181
Lord baelish has told many lies.

250
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:10,019
All to protect me.

251
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,314
Since my father was executed,

252
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:16,442
I have been a hostage in king's landing.

253
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:20,821
A plaything for Joffrey to torture
or queen Cersei to torment.

254
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:24,116
They beat me, they humiliated me,

255
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,368
they married me to the imp.

256
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,538
I had no friends in king's landing,

257
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:33,793
except one.

258
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:42,301
He saved me.

259
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:45,638
Smuggled me away when he had the chance.

260
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:52,061
He knew I'd be safe here in the eyrie
with my own blood, my aunt lysa.

261
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:56,482
But the lannisters have friends everywhere.

262
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:57,942
Even the vale.

263
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:01,487
He made me swear
not to tell anyone my true name.

264
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,239
Your secret is safe with us, my lady.

265
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:06,450
Royce: Your father grew up
right here in these halls.

266
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:08,619
We hunted together many times.

267
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:10,204
He was a fine man.

268
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,124
Tell us what happened to your aunt, sansa.

269
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:20,589
You knew her well, my lords, my lady.

270
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:22,258
She was a troubled woman.

271
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,220
She always loved lord baelish.
She told me herself.

272
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,473
From the moment he arrived
at the gates of riverrun,

273
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:33,269
a boy of eight carrying
everything he owned in a little sack.

274
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:38,524
She confessed to me
she never loved lord arryn.

275
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:42,027
She did as her father commanded,
as so many of us have.

276
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:46,198
When the gods finally allowed her
to be with lord baelish,

277
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:49,118
she was so happy. For a time.

278
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:53,747
My aunt was a jealous lady.

279
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:59,545
She was terrified that
lord baelish didn't love her any more.

280
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:02,548
That he would abandon her
for a younger woman.

281
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:07,970
And then,

282
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:11,015
one day she saw him kiss me.

283
00:23:11,265 --> 00:23:12,349
Lady sansa.

284
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:15,853
It was a peck on the cheek, lord Royce,
nothing more.

285
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:20,316
Lord baelish is my uncle now, by marriage.

286
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:22,610
He's always been so kind to me.

287
00:23:22,693 --> 00:23:25,738
I was so happy to be here, to be free.

288
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:26,864
All because of him.

289
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,992
But my aunt turned on me.

290
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:33,120
She cursed me. Called me a whore.

291
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:36,415
Promised to throw me
through the moon door.

292
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:40,544
When lord baelish tried to calm her,
she struck him.

293
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:41,897
She said she didn't want to live any more.

294
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:44,006
She stood on the edge of that moon door.

295
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,925
He tried to reason with her,

296
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:49,428
promised her
she was the only one he had ever loved,

297
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:53,057
but she stepped through those doors
and she was...

298
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:01,315
It's not your fault, sweet girl.

299
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:09,239
It's not your fault.

300
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:26,674
Royce: You could see it in the way
she raised that boy.

301
00:24:26,757 --> 00:24:29,677
Feeding him from her own teats
when he was 10 years old.

302
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,763
Anya: Lord Royce! This is hardly the time.

303
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:34,807
Apologies, my lady.

304
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:38,143
And to you as well, baelish.
We treated you a bit harshly.

305
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:42,022
You wantjustice, lord Royce.
I can hardly complain about that.

306
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:43,315
I want the same.

307
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:48,028
Anya: Not much justice to be
meted out in suicide, is there?

308
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:50,406
Littlefinger: For lysa, no.
But for her son?

309
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:52,658
Only 20 years ago, the knights of the vale

310
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:56,161
rode behind Jon arryn,
ned stark, Robert Baratheon.

311
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:59,665
They fought together
to overcome the mad king.

312
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:03,002
And since then, arryn and Royce,
corbray, waynwood,

313
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:06,213
all the great houses of the vale
watched from the corner.

314
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:08,716
A timid boy at a tavern brawl.

315
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,385
Are you questioning our courage?

316
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:14,013
I want to know which side you're on.

317
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:17,033
Do you support the lannisters, the house
that executed your friend ned stark?

318
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:19,727
Of course we don't support
the damn lannisters.

319
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:22,938
No? Catelyn stark begged her sister
for support, and lysa refused.

320
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:25,107
By staying out of the fray,

321
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:29,236
you've allowed tywin Lannister to
destroy his rivals on every compass point.

322
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,779
Who stands against him now?

323
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:33,407
Who would you have us back, lord baelish?

324
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,242
Robb stark is dead.

325
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:37,828
I'd have you back Robin arryn,

326
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:39,288
lord of the vale.

327
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,623
Robin arryn is a sickly little boy.

328
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:45,002
And sickly little boys
sometimes become powerful men.

329
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:47,046
More often they die young.

330
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:49,715
I adored lysa with all my heart,

331
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:53,886
but she loved her son so much
she became overprotective.

332
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:57,598
He needs to learn how to swing a sword,
how to ride a horse.

333
00:25:57,681 --> 00:26:01,101
- Aye, it's time.
- Yes.

334
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:05,272
Time for him to tour the vale,
to visit all the castles in his domain.

335
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:08,650
Time for Robin to leave the nest.

336
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:29,838
Boy: Ser barristan.

337
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:31,673
Yes?

338
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:35,010
Who sent you?

339
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:13,048
- Ser barristan.
- Ser jorah.

340
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:15,884
Have I forgotten a council meeting?

341
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:28,689
What's this?

342
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:31,900
A royal pardon signed by Robert Baratheon.

343
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:48,584
You spied on her.

344
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:52,254
Who gave you this?

345
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:54,339
Does it matter?

346
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:08,478
- Have you told her?
- I wanted to tell you first, man-to-man,

347
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:10,689
rather than go behind your back.

348
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:15,611
Let me speak with her in private.

349
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:17,863
You'll never be alone with her again.

350
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:56,985
Why did the usurper pardon you?

351
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:01,698
If we could speak alone.

352
00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:04,868
No, speak to me here.

353
00:29:04,952 --> 00:29:06,787
Explain it to me.

354
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:09,998
Who do you think sent this to meereen?
Who profits?

355
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:13,168
This is the work of tywin Lannister.

356
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:15,128
He wants to divide us.

357
00:29:15,212 --> 00:29:17,631
If we're fighting each other,
we're not fighting him.

358
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:20,592
The pardon was signed the year we met.

359
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:23,720
Why were you pardoned?

360
00:29:23,804 --> 00:29:26,098
Unless you're saying
this document was forged.

361
00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:30,602
It is not forged.

362
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:32,604
Why, then?

363
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:34,398
I sent letters to varys,

364
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:37,359
the spymaster of king's landing.

365
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,069
What was the content of these letters?

366
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:41,571
- Information.
- What information?

367
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:45,242
When you and viserys arrived in pentos.

368
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:47,077
His plan to marry you to khal drogo.

369
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:49,288
When you were married.

370
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:51,206
When your brother died.

371
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,625
You told him I was carrying drogo's child?

372
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:55,460
- I...
- Yes or no?

373
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:56,688
- Khaleesi.
- Don't call me that.

374
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:59,798
Did you tell him I was
carrying drogo's child?

375
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:03,969
Yes.

376
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:10,517
That wine merchant tried to poison me
because of your information.

377
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,311
I stopped you from drinking his wine.

378
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:14,438
Because you knew it was poisoned.

379
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:16,648
I suspected.

380
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:18,400
You betrayed me

381
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:21,320
from the first.

382
00:30:21,403 --> 00:30:23,238
Forgive me.

383
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:25,615
I never meant...

384
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:28,452
Please, khaleesi, forgive me.

385
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:31,580
You sold my secrets to
the man who killed my father

386
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,808
- and stole my brother's throne...
- I have protected you,

387
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:36,512
- fought for you, killed for you.
- And you want me to forgive you?

388
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:40,505
I have loved you.

389
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:42,257
Love?

390
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:45,552
Love? How can you say that to me?

391
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:48,513
Any other man,
and I would have you executed.

392
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:51,683
But you,
I do not want you in my city dead or alive.

393
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:56,897
Go back to your masters in king's landing.
Collect your pardon, if you can.

394
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:02,235
Daenerys, please.

395
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:07,199
Don't ever presume to touch me again
or speak my name.

396
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:10,118
You have until dusk to collect your things
and leave this city.

397
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:13,580
If you're found in
meereen past break of day,

398
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:16,124
I'll have your head
thrown into slaver's bay.

399
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:23,799
Now.

400
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:22,023
Moat cailin is yours, father.

401
00:32:28,864 --> 00:32:30,782
Walk with me.

402
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:33,285
Has there been any word from Locke?

403
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:38,707
Unimportant. A cripple, a young boy.

404
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:41,710
None of the northern lords have seen them.

405
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:44,463
Dead most likely.

406
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:49,384
Most of the ironborn have fled the north.

407
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:53,263
Now more will follow, thanks to you.

408
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,559
Tell me what you see.

409
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:04,483
Moors, fields, hills.

410
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:07,235
Tell me what you see.

411
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:13,909
Nothing.

412
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:16,912
Not nothing. The north.

413
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,915
Ride 700 miles that way,
you're still in the north.

414
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:23,460
400 miles that way.

415
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:25,712
300 miles that way.

416
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:29,633
The north is larger than
the other six kingdoms combined.

417
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:32,052
And I am the warden of the north.

418
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:34,346
The north is mine.

419
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:38,266
Now tell me, what is your name?

420
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,064
Ramsay snow.

421
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:46,441
No, not ramsay snow.

422
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,110
Open it.

423
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:52,489
From this day until your last day,

424
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:54,533
you are ramsay Bolton,

425
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:57,494
son of roose Bolton, warden of the north.

426
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:05,460
You honour me.

427
00:34:06,336 --> 00:34:09,673
I swear I will uphold your name
and your tradition.

428
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:14,010
I will be worthy of you, father,

429
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:15,845
I promise.

430
00:34:34,364 --> 00:34:37,617
Come, reek, I'll be needing a bath.

431
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:07,564
Yes?

432
00:35:21,578 --> 00:35:23,997
First time I saw you,
you were just a child.

433
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,083
A girl from the north
come to the capital for the first time.

434
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:29,753
You're not a child any longer.

435
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:36,092
Why did you help me?

436
00:35:36,176 --> 00:35:40,430
They would have thrown you through
the moon door if they found you guilty.

437
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:42,891
That's not an answer.

438
00:35:45,352 --> 00:35:48,229
If they'd have executed you,
what would they have done with me?

439
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,733
I don't know.

440
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,735
Neither do I.

441
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:59,032
Better to gamble on the man you know
than the strangers you don't?

442
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:03,953
And you think you know me?

443
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:08,375
- I know what you want.
- Do you?

444
00:36:24,057 --> 00:36:26,017
Arya: I thought it'd make me happy,

445
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:28,103
but it doesn't. Not really.

446
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,896
Hound: Nothing makes you happy.

447
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:31,749
- Arya: Lots of things make me happy.
- Like what?

448
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:33,400
Arya: Killing polliver, killing rorge.

449
00:36:33,483 --> 00:36:37,070
So you're sad because
you didn't get to kill Joffrey yourself,

450
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:38,196
is that it?

451
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:40,049
Arya: At least I could have
been there to watch.

452
00:36:40,073 --> 00:36:42,701
I wanted to see the look in his eyes
when he knew it was over.

453
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:46,162
Aye, nothing in the world beats that look.

454
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:50,959
You protected him for most of his life.
You think you could have saved him?

455
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,878
I wasn't the damn wine-taster.

456
00:36:55,505 --> 00:37:00,343
Little shit deserved to die, but poison...

457
00:37:00,427 --> 00:37:02,178
Poison's a woman's weapon.

458
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,139
Men kill with steel.

459
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:08,393
That's your stupid pride talking.
It's why you'll never be a great killer.

460
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:11,354
I'd have killed Joffrey with a chicken bone
if I had to.

461
00:37:12,522 --> 00:37:15,775
I'd pay good money to see that.

462
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,780
You should have let me burn it.

463
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:23,450
It's a erabite.

464
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:27,579
That fleabite's got you walking
a lot slower than you used to.

465
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:30,999
Hound: Well, we won't have to walk
too much further.

466
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,722
You really think my aunt will pay for me?

467
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:36,087
I've never even met her.

468
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:39,340
Doesn't matter. You're her blood.

469
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:43,052
Famin, honour, all that horseshit.

470
00:37:43,762 --> 00:37:46,181
It's all you lords and
ladies ever talk about.

471
00:37:46,848 --> 00:37:48,475
I'm not a lady.

472
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:51,186
Knight: Who would pass the bloody gate?

473
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:55,064
The bloody hound, sandor clegane.

474
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:56,941
And his

475
00:37:58,193 --> 00:38:00,528
travelling companion, Arya stark,

476
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:03,698
niece of your lady lysa arryn.

477
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:06,493
Then I offer my condolences.

478
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:08,453
Lady arryn died.

479
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:14,209
Three days ago.

480
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:35,480
I've never left home before,
uncle petyr. I'm afraid to leave.

481
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:36,815
You shouldn't be.

482
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:40,068
The lord of the vale belongs in the eyrie,
mother said.

483
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,153
It's not safe outside.

484
00:38:42,237 --> 00:38:43,696
It wasn't safe for her inside.

485
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:47,700
People die at their dinner tables.

486
00:38:47,784 --> 00:38:49,577
They die in their beds.

487
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:53,164
They die squatting over their chamber pots.

488
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:55,416
Everybody dies sooner or later.

489
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,585
Don't worry about your death.

490
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:00,797
Worry about your life.

491
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,926
Take charge of your
life for as long as it lasts.

492
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:08,388
That is what it means
to be lord of the vale.

493
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:34,122
Shall we go?

494
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:44,007
Wine always helps.

495
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:47,594
I thank you for it.

496
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:51,514
Trial by combat.

497
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:55,935
Deciding a man's guilt or innocence

498
00:39:56,019 --> 00:39:57,812
in the eyes of the gods

499
00:39:57,896 --> 00:40:01,149
by having two other men
hack each other to pieces.

500
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,818
Tells you something about the gods.

501
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:07,405
How much longer?

502
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:09,991
Soon.

503
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:14,704
Do you think oberyn has a chance?

504
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:19,792
The red viper of dorne.

505
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:22,187
You don't get a name like that
unless you're deadly, right?

506
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:23,588
I've never seen him fight.

507
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:26,382
Oh, he's going to die. I'm going to die.

508
00:40:26,466 --> 00:40:29,928
- Oberyn believes in himself.
- That's putting it mildly.

509
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:33,014
What's the punishment for regicide?

510
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,975
Drawing and quartering? Hanging?

511
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:38,436
- Breaking at the wheel?
- Beheading.

512
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:40,104
Seems rather ordinary.

513
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:42,440
And he was my nephew as well,
so what is that?

514
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:46,319
Fratricide is brothers
and filicide is sons.

515
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:50,031
Nepoticide. That's the one.

516
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,703
Matricide, patricide,

517
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:58,539
infanticide, suicide.

518
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:02,085
There's no kind of killing
that doesn't have its own word.

519
00:41:02,669 --> 00:41:05,797
- Cousins.
- You're right.

520
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,132
There is no word for cousin-killing.

521
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:09,968
Well done.

522
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:12,303
Do you remember cousin Orson?
Orson Lannister?

523
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:15,848
Of course. Wet-nurse dropped him
on his head and left him simple.

524
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:17,517
Simple?

525
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:21,020
Used to sit all day in the garden
crushing beetles with a rock.

526
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:28,820
- Nothing made him happier.
- Nothing made you happier.

527
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:30,446
You'd think being tormented from birth

528
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:32,740
would have given you
some affinity for the afflicted.

529
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:34,283
On the contrary.

530
00:41:34,367 --> 00:41:35,952
Laughing at another person's misery

531
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:38,235
was the only thing that
made me feel like everyone else.

532
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:42,166
- The joke wore thin, though.
- For you. You drifted away.

533
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:43,418
I had other interests.

534
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:45,461
Yes, other interests.

535
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:50,758
- But I stayed with Orson.
- Why?

536
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:53,052
I was curious.

537
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:56,431
Why was he smashing all those beetles?
What did he get out of it?

538
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:59,142
First thing I did was ask him.

539
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:02,311
"Orson, why are you smashing
all those beetles?"

540
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,522
He gave me an answer.

541
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:07,442
"Smash the beetles. Smash 'em."

542
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:11,821
I wasn't deterred.

543
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:13,406
I was the smartest person I knew.

544
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:15,783
Certainly I had the wherewithal
to unravel the mysteries

545
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:18,077
that lay at the heart of a moron.

546
00:42:18,453 --> 00:42:21,164
So I went to maester volarik's library.

547
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:23,249
Volarik. Tried to touch me once.

548
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:25,793
Turns out, far too much
has been written about great men

549
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:28,212
and not nearly enough about morons.

550
00:42:28,588 --> 00:42:30,631
Doesn't seem right.

551
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:34,552
In any case, I found nothing that
illuminated the nature of Orson's affliction

552
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:37,430
or the reason behind
his relentless beetle slaughter.

553
00:42:37,847 --> 00:42:40,016
So I went back to the source.

554
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:41,934
I may not have been
able to speak with Orson,

555
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:44,729
but I could observe him, watch him

556
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:46,898
the way men watch animals

557
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:49,776
to come to a deeper understanding
of their behaviour.

558
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:54,405
And as I watched,

559
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:57,033
I became more and more sure of it.

560
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:59,368
There was something happening there.

561
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:02,413
His face was like the page of a book

562
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:04,499
written in a language I didn't understand.

563
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:07,335
But he wasn't mindless. He had his reasons.

564
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:10,671
And I became possessed
with knowing what they were.

565
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:13,424
I began to spend
inordinate amounts of time watching him.

566
00:43:15,051 --> 00:43:17,428
I would eat my lunch in the garden,

567
00:43:17,512 --> 00:43:19,180
chewing my mutton to the music of...

568
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:24,227
And when iwasn't watching him,
I was thinking about him.

569
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,354
Father droned on about the family legacy,

570
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:28,314
and I thought about Orson's beetles.

571
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:31,109
I read the histories of
Targaryen conquests.

572
00:43:31,192 --> 00:43:33,111
Did I hear dragon wings? No.

573
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:34,278
I heard...

574
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:39,784
And I still couldn't figure out
why he was doing it.

575
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:43,371
And I had to know, because it was horrible

576
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:45,706
that all these beetles should be
dying for no reason.

577
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:47,291
Every day around the world,

578
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:51,087
men, women, and children
are murdered by the score.

579
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:53,631
Who gives a dusty fuck about
a bunch of beetles?

580
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:57,218
I know. But still it filled me with dread.

581
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:59,971
Piles and piles of them,
years and years of them.

582
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:01,889
How many countless living, crawling things

583
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:04,892
smashed and dried out
and returned to the dirt?

584
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:07,812
In my dreams I found myself

585
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:09,897
standing on a beach made of beetle husks

586
00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:12,400
stretching as far as the eye could see.

587
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:17,071
I woke up crying,
weeping for their shattered little bodies.

588
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:18,865
I tried to stop Orson once.

589
00:44:18,948 --> 00:44:20,116
He was twice your size.

590
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:24,579
He just pushed me aside with a "cuhn"
and kept on smashing.

591
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,122
Every day,

592
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:29,083
until that mule kicked him in the chest
and killed him.

593
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:42,013
So what do you think?

594
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:45,600
Why did he do it?

595
00:44:45,892 --> 00:44:47,768
What was it all about?

596
00:44:51,189 --> 00:44:52,940
I don't know.

597
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:13,711
Good luck today.

598
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:48,329
Looks like very light armour.

599
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:49,497
I like to move around.

600
00:45:49,664 --> 00:45:51,249
You could at least wear a helmet.

601
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:55,127
You shouldn't drink before a fight.

602
00:45:55,211 --> 00:45:57,411
You learned this during
your years in the fighting pits?

603
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:59,590
I always drink before a fight.

604
00:45:59,674 --> 00:46:02,343
It could get you killed.
It could get me killed.

605
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:05,179
Today is not the day I die.

606
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:14,981
You're going to fight that?

607
00:46:15,064 --> 00:46:16,607
I'm going to kill that.

608
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:22,631
Ellaria: He is the biggest man
I've ever seen.

609
00:46:22,655 --> 00:46:25,616
Size does not matter
when you are flat on your back.

610
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:27,243
Thank the gods.

611
00:46:29,537 --> 00:46:32,581
In the sight of gods and men,

612
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:38,045
we gather to ascertain
the guilt or innocence of this...

613
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:42,049
Man, Tyrion Lannister.

614
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:44,176
May the mother Grant them mercy.

615
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:48,639
May the father give them
such justice as they deserve.

616
00:46:48,723 --> 00:46:51,976
And may the warrior guide the hand
of our champion...

617
00:47:02,445 --> 00:47:04,405
Don't leave me alone in this world.

618
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:06,240
Never.

619
00:47:27,011 --> 00:47:28,763
Have they told you who I am?

620
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:29,930
Some dead man.

621
00:47:35,186 --> 00:47:37,813
I am the brother of elia martell.

622
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:42,276
And do you know why I have come all the
way to this stinking shit-pile of a city?

623
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:44,570
Foryou.

624
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:52,536
I'm going to hear you
confess before you die.

625
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:56,040
You raped my sister. You murdered her.

626
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:57,792
You killed her children.

627
00:47:58,459 --> 00:48:00,878
Say it now, and we can make this quick.

628
00:48:08,803 --> 00:48:11,472
Say it. You raped her.

629
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:13,682
You murdered her.

630
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:19,438
You killed her children.

631
00:48:31,117 --> 00:48:35,079
You raped her! You murdered her!
You killed her children!

632
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:16,620
You raped her!

633
00:49:16,704 --> 00:49:18,038
You murdered her!

634
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:29,800
You killed her children!

635
00:49:37,558 --> 00:49:39,894
Wait. Are you dying?

636
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:43,898
No. You can't die yet.
You haven't confessed.

637
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:48,777
Say it.

638
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:52,990
Say her name. Elia martell.

639
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:55,618
You raped her. You killed her children.

640
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:57,912
Elia martell.

641
00:49:58,037 --> 00:49:59,622
Who gave you the order?

642
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:02,333
Who gave you the order?

643
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:04,126
Say her name!

644
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:06,837
You raped her! You murdered her!

645
00:50:06,921 --> 00:50:09,048
You killed her children!

646
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:11,425
Say her name.

647
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:15,054
Say it!

648
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:23,604
Elia martell.

649
00:50:25,523 --> 00:50:27,107
I killed her children,

650
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:28,984
then I raped her.

651
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:33,113
Then I smashed her head in like this!

652
00:50:47,253 --> 00:50:48,963
The gods have made their will known.

653
00:50:50,214 --> 00:50:52,466
Tyrion Lannister,

654
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:55,135
in the name of king tommen
of the house Baratheon,

655
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:57,346
first of his name,

656
00:50:57,429 --> 00:50:59,181
you are hereby sentenced to death.
