1
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,160
09 MONTHS TO THE RIOTS

2
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,720
ZEE AND GANG

3
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,040
Zee!

4
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,960
Zee!

5
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,096
<i>Damn it, Zee,
I've been calling you for so long.</i>

6
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,200
<i>You forgot about
your submissions today again, right?</i>

7
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,240
I've already missed out four times.

8
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,160
I have to clear it in this attempt.

9
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,120
You don't get marks for attempts.

10
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,920
And you must present
your paper properly.

11
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,240
Mr. Wise Guy.

12
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,480
Just stall them. I'll be there.

13
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,080
Five minutes.

14
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,360
We don't have five minutes.

15
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,160
They are already announcing
your name, Zee.

16
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,880
Take this…

17
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,536
I just received a message from Satish,
they have already reached there.

18
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,760
- Come on.
- Give it here.

19
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,320
- All the best, Zee.
- Hey, thanks!

20
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,480
- Fast.
- Here take this… Hold it.

21
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,200
You must clear it this time, okay?

22
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,680
- All the best, Zee.
- Hey, thanks!

23
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,880
If you clear it this time,

24
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,480
the party is on me, okay?

25
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,440
- God bless you!
- Come, run.

26
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,520
Hair, hair.

27
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,736
We've been waiting for so long.

28
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,800
- At least remove your sunglasses.
- Move move move.

29
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,320
My apologies.
I was detained in traffic.

30
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,656
This is the fourth time
I am presenting...

31
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,520
Fifth!

32
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,240
Fifth time I am presenting my thesis.

33
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,920
And this time I am ready.

34
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,080
Ready…
Yeah.

35
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,440
Ready...

36
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,320
Yeah.

37
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,440
This time I am ready

38
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,160
because I'm backed up
with a lot of data.

39
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,960
- Xavier, can you please start?
- Fine.

40
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,520
Are you sober, bro?

41
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,056
Yes, Satish. There is no problem.

42
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,200
That's sir, not Satish.

43
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,920
What if I don't call you sir?

44
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,040
Don't embarrass me
in front of the Dean.

45
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,840
Are you okay?

46
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,920
Hey, what are you doing?

47
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,200
This is your fifth attempt,
remember that.

48
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,600
And without wasting
any more time of yours,

49
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,760
my thesis is on our battle against
mental health issues

50
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,120
especially, depression.

51
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,520
Using psychedelic drugs, hallucinogens,

52
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,720
and supported by...

53
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,960
Basically, this time…

54
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,040
- Zee.
- I have…

55
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,200
Xavier, are you alright?

56
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,480
- What's wrong Xavier?
- Are you okay?

57
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,520
Satish, is anything wrong?

58
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,360
Five hours…
Every five hours…

59
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,600
Is something wrong with him?

60
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,920
Xavier.

61
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,520
Why is he behaving like this?

62
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,400
Xavier.

63
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,600
Xavier, are you okay?

64
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,880
No phone.

65
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,760
Yeah, Zee.

66
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,560
Zee! Hey!

67
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,280
Zee.

68
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,960
Are you okay?

69
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,880
You know these experiments
will get you in trouble someday, Rish.

70
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,800
Bro, I am trying to
save somebody's life here.

71
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,520
Yeah.

72
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,840
Somebody whose life
you put in danger in the first place.

73
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,200
This stupid sandwich.

74
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,560
Why did you have to put
that stuff in the sandwich?

75
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,440
I was just experimenting
with some new stuff.

76
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,000
I kept it in the fridge,
he ate it.

77
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,320
And he ate it all.

78
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,440
Not my fault.

79
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,200
And you know why I do all this.

80
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,560
To give people inner joy.

81
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,760
My life has been very sad lately,

82
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,000
can I get some happy pills?

83
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,240
The seniors told me,
you have a stash that's unreal.

84
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,600
I can pay you good money for it.

85
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,040
Have you even hit puberty yet?

86
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,440
You came to watch a film.

87
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,800
Go watch.

88
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,080
Sorry.

89
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,120
Sister.

90
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,720
You know your reputation
as a dealer is growing stronger, bro.

91
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,680
You'll soon see the insides of a prison.

92
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,320
Same old cheap Vagator stuff.

93
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,120
You need a better dealer, bro.

94
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,880
If anything happens to Xavier,
you are the first to his rescue.

95
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,960
Regular people like us
don't even make it to your list.

96
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,560
Baby doll.

97
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,400
You don't need to be on the list.

98
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,360
What are you worried about?

99
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,280
You have direct access here.

100
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,000
The effects should show in two hours.

101
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,480
That's okay, but,

102
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,360
what was in the sandwich, Rish?

103
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,280
Whatever it was, it was
supposed to be eaten bite-sized.

104
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,160
Bite-size is

105
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,080
relative because this
here is your bite-size,

106
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,920
and this is my bite-size.

107
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,120
Zee…

108
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,680
Xavier? You failed
your fourth attempt, right?

109
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,920
Now, when is the next attempt?

110
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
What's this?

111
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,080
Gayatri has called everyone to college.

112
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,840
The Professor Kishore issue.

113
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,800
There's more drama in our college
than in the Game of Rones.

114
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,840
Did everyone get the text?

115
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,840
Yes.

116
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,920
Do we have to go?

117
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Yeah, let's go.

118
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,040
Hey…

119
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,600
Hey!

120
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,616
Everyone got the text, right?

121
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,296
- Everyone's been called, right?
- Yes, we got it.

122
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,600
Come on, get out.
Get going.

123
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,480
- Go to the campus, everyone!
- Come on!

124
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,480
When the Awaaz Committee summons, you go!

125
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,520
When Gayatri calls for you, you go!

126
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,480
The show's over,
and the protest has begun.

127
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,200
Come on, let's go.

128
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,160
Gayatri, we're strictly against
this protest culture.

129
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,720
I know that what happened is wrong.

130
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,320
We spoke to the professor,

131
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,160
and it won't happen again.

132
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,960
Professor Kishore has insulted
a <i>Bahujan</i> student.

133
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,280
He abused her caste.

134
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,400
This issue cannot be solved by talking.

135
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,040
The college must fire him.

136
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,440
Neither am I going
to apologize to anyone

137
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,240
nor am I scared of anyone.

138
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,680
Okay.

139
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,800
Let's go.

140
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,760
Sir, I hope you have
an extra pair of clothes.

141
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,640
Because until our demands are met,

142
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,080
no one is leaving.

143
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,800
Sit down.

144
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,160
Bhau is here, and he will fix everything.

145
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,240
I am not just the trustee of this college

146
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,280
but also a concerned citizen of Goa.

147
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,280
A supporter of the students.

148
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,880
My daughter, Siddhi, told me
what happened in the college.

149
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,720
That professor is a friend of mine.

150
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,480
But what is wrong is wrong.

151
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,720
And he must pay for it.

152
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,560
I've spoken to all the trustees,

153
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,000
and I request the Honorable Dean

154
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,840
to respect the sentiments

155
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,760
and demands of the students.

156
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,200
And suspend Professor Kishore Sahay

157
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,320
with immediate effect.

158
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,240
- Long live…
- Our Bhau!

159
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,440
- Long live…
- Our Bhau!

160
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,360
- Long live…
- Our Bhau!

161
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,320
- Long live…
- Our Bhau!

162
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,240
- Long live…
- Our Bhau!

163
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,240
- Long live…
- Our Bhau!

164
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,320
- Long live…
- Our Bhau!

165
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,400
Here we go…

166
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,200
After securing a glorious victory
for the Awaaz Party

167
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,920
in every corner of the country,

168
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,200
a tired and sore Gayatri Raj Shekaran
and her lackeys are finally back.

169
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,160
I think she would like a beer.

170
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,400
Awaaz has no interest in politics.

171
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,320
- Sure.
- Good job, G.

172
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,200
Every WhatsApp group of our class

173
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,480
has #JusticePrevails trending.

174
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,760
- Yeah, that's right.
- Armchair activists.

175
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,840
That's all you guys do.

176
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,200
Real battles are won on the ground
and not on mobiles.

177
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,280
Yeah.

178
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,080
That too.

179
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,680
Has the professor gone yet?

180
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,280
Hopefully tomorrow.

181
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,520
Management has said that

182
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,960
they are going to find
a new genetics professor.

183
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,400
If he doesn't leave,
just let me know.

184
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,440
This is not the answer to everything.

185
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,560
This can be the answer to everything.

186
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,080
I think you should also try.

187
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,400
There's no need to do anything.

188
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,936
Why was the Awaaz Committee
formed in the first place?

189
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,960
For the students.

190
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,120
To raise a voice against injustice.

191
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,400
To fight for students' rights.

192
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,080
And did you see what happened today?

193
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,880
One student raised her voice,
and many more voices joined in.

194
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,240
It became an echo.

195
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,280
I can see…

196
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,480
YUVA'S ENTRY

197
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,480
The new generation is full of enthusiasm.

198
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Your future lies ahead of you.

199
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,120
Joining St. Martin's
is your first step towards it.

200
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,640
I welcome you all.

201
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,520
First of all, greetings
to all the freshers.

202
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,520
This is your hostel.

203
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,800
Boys hostel.

204
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,840
From Monday to Friday,
curfew starts at 8:00 p.m.

205
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,520
Try attending college for a change.

206
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,120
- For breakfast there are…
- Slaps!

207
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,640
- The seniors will give you…
- Kicks!

208
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,480
Bow your heads people,
we are thorns that prick.

209
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,976
- The seniors will give you…
- Kicks!

210
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,560
Bow your heads people,
we are thorns that prick.

211
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,400
We are thorns that prick.

212
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,840
Yuva, right?

213
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,160
I am Harsh Pandey.

214
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,800
We're here,

215
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,720
but I've heard that
the first week is hell for freshers.

216
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,640
Don't be stressed.

217
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,680
The next five years
will go by like a breeze.

218
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,160
Become my best friend.

219
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,040
Hey! Who's inside?

220
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,760
Come on, sing! Sing!

221
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,240
Sing!

222
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,680
Go back!

223
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,160
Go back! Move!

224
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,080
Go back!

225
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,240
I told you not to do it.

226
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,240
Now they will beat me up
because of you.

227
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,440
If I die before graduation,

228
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,680
my father is going to be furious!

229
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,400
Don't be afraid.

230
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,600
You will live to see graduation.

231
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,200
That's my guarantee.

232
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,280
But who is taking your guarantee?

233
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,040
I survived all these years
without any guarantee or warranty.

234
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,720
Why change now?

235
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,360
Hey, move!

236
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,800
- Hey!
- Where is he?

237
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,360
- Where is he?
- I don't know, sir.

238
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,440
By the way, Guruji,
are you a senior as well?

239
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,760
Move!

240
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,816
I have a couple of papers
left to clear the first year.

241
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:51,936
Otherwise, I am your senior.

242
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,400
Show them no mercy today.

243
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,680
- Look, here come the super seniors.
- Look over there!

244
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,600
The landlords of this hostel.

245
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,840
Catch hold of him!

246
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,000
Where is he?

247
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,440
- That's him.
- Come out.

248
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,800
- Piece of dirt.
- Get out!

249
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,200
You dare hit your senior.

250
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,080
I'm trying to wash this dirt off.

251
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,560
- Give me a minute.
- Come on.

252
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,640
I'll scrub you like a newlywed,

253
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,440
or my name isn't Napoleon.
Come out.

254
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,440
Will you also give me a happy ending?

255
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,160
- Is this funny?
- Hey!

256
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,880
Drag him out.

257
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,400
Hey, wait a minute!

258
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,360
I must admit,

259
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,920
I cannot fight all of you alone.

260
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,960
But know this…

261
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,040
Whoever lays a finger on me first…

262
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,160
Whoever lays a finger on me first…

263
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,960
I swear on my father
and my forefathers,

264
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,800
he will lie in bed for ten days.

265
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,040
I promise you that.

266
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,560
- Hey.
- Come on.

267
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,120
- Hey, come on.
- Go on!

268
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,280
Why did you get down,
you gym machine?

269
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,360
Get back up there.

270
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,040
Boys, do I have to listen
to his TedTalk alone?

271
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,360
Bro, you were screaming in English.

272
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,400
Come on.

273
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,680
Come on.

274
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,880
Why are you backing out now?

275
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,040
Let's go.

276
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,520
Useless prick.

277
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,720
You deal with him first,
I'll join you…

278
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,160
I will deal with him.

279
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,880
This is my job.

280
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,760
I am fighting for you guys.

281
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,840
Everyone's useless.

282
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,400
- Beat him up!
- Hit him!

283
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,720
Hi.

284
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,760
It's very painful.

285
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,440
It's just a simple bruise.

286
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,480
Nothing major.

287
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,560
Not here.

288
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,800
It's paining here.

289
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,880
Because you didn't reply.

290
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,520
You've been discharged, okay?

291
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,640
Will I have to get admitted
again to see you?

292
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,040
- I can't do it.
- You must do some movement.

293
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,280
That's it. That's it.

294
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,480
- She'll break my leg!
- Sir…

295
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,960
I told you.

296
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,680
Throwing lemons at me,
but I will bust your lemons.

297
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,520
- Calm down. Quiet!
- Get lost, you loser.

298
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,760
Don't shout.
This is a hospital.

299
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,840
So what?

300
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,040
He hit me.
And you are scolding me.

301
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,680
- Relax. Relax.
- Don't touch me!

302
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,080
Are you the sister or a minister?

303
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,960
- Relax. Relax.
- Don't touch me.

304
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,040
Calm down.

305
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,200
Giving her the GS position
without an election is unfair.

306
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,680
But we can only remove her
if you have an option.

307
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,880
Do you have an option?

308
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,080
We do.
Ambika.

309
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,760
Ambika, are you up for it?

310
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,160
If the students want it,
then definitely yes.

311
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,840
What is Xavier doing in the Awaaz office?

312
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,480
Did your lecture finally work on him?

313
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,720
- Yuva!
- I will kill you.

314
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,400
I swear, I won't shower
until I don't find that rabbit.

315
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,640
Look over there, you fool.

316
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:12,880
Check over there.

317
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,320
- I will tear him apart.
- Come on.

318
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,840
- I will kill him.
- I will kill you!

319
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,800
Are they going to chase us all year?

320
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,200
I will have to do
something permanent about him.

321
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,480
Warden sir,
I am extending a hand for help.

322
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,640
Now that we are friends,

323
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,160
I want some favors from you.

324
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,280
I can manage the medical boys.

325
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,320
But the boys from Arts,
Engineering, and Dental…

326
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,200
I want the names of all
the troublemakers,

327
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,160
the bad boys.

328
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,816
I can't help you if the admission
department isn't giving you a seat.

329
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:48,080
I know, sir, but you took an advance
from him and promised a seat.

330
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,000
I don't own the college.

331
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,720
I only run an agency here.

332
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,520
Thousands of students come to me.

333
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,160
I can't get admission for all of them.

334
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,960
You are right, sir.
But at least return his money.

335
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,040
No.

336
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,080
I have a strict no-refund policy.

337
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,000
My forefathers were priests in temples.

338
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,120
I don't want to get
into the caste system.

339
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,440
Tell me,

340
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,720
how can I let these students
from other castes in my hostel?

341
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,640
Xavier.

342
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,520
What are you doing, Xavier?

343
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,000
What is his side business, Gupta?

344
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,400
Sir gives coaching.

345
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,640
Coaching business.

346
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,160
He intentionally fails students,

347
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,480
- who don't take coaching from him.
- Leave me, Xavier.

348
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,440
Xavier, please.

349
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,840
Now we have his complete record.

350
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,080
Xavier, please, no.

351
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,280
- His name, address and details
- Xavier, please.

352
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,360
To lodge a complaint with
the board of education.

353
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,320
Take a picture.

354
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,000
Remember, Mr. Professor,

355
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,480
teachers are worshipped.

356
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,640
There is no need to be God.

357
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,080
Just show some honesty,

358
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,480
and I won't have to take any action.

359
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,880
Understood.

360
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,760
Sir. I respect you
and your no-refund policy very much.

361
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,080
We don't want a refund.

362
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,680
The tires and engine will be some kind
of compensation for the students.

363
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,520
That'll be enough.

364
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,560
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.

365
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,040
From today, your hostel gates
will always be open for students,

366
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,216
irrespective of their caste.

367
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,280
Got it, Panditji?

368
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,120
Look properly everywhere. Find him.

369
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,680
Hi!

370
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,720
- Are they coming?
- Look properly.

371
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,160
Are they coming towards me?

372
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,840
Do they look angry?

373
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,800
Are they coming in a bunch?

374
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,040
He came here, right?

375
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,320
The sauce is too salty.

376
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,400
I thought so as well.

377
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,440
Here's an idea.

378
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,760
I'll pack this food for you.

379
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,680
Because if you stay here,
your clothes will get ruined.

380
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,000
Packing some breakfast.

381
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,000
- We haven't had breakfast for so long.
- Why?

382
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,040
Because we swore
to beat him up first.

383
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,920
What day is it today, guys?

384
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Tuesday.

385
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,880
Today is not Tuesday.

386
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,760
It's "beat him up" day.
Right, Yuva?

387
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:36,080
And if I don't beat him up
before the fresher's party,

388
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,280
it'll make me restless.

389
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,720
When I don't hit someone,
my stomach starts churning.

390
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,640
That's bad for health.

391
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,480
- Really! I keep burping.
- We are here.

392
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,640
We won't let you fall sick.

393
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,240
Thank you.

394
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,280
Good.

395
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,760
Guys, friends,
brothers, and some sisters.

396
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,600
- Get down.
- Get down!

397
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,280
We've tolerated them for too long.

398
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,480
Hey.

399
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,680
Get down.

400
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,760
- Hey!
- He's trying to escape.

401
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,640
I've been facing them alone.

402
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,840
Let's fight back together today!

403
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,400
Beat him!

404
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,200
- Hey!
- One moment!

405
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,720
- Shut up.
- Hold on. Move.

406
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,440
Silence!
Siddhi, you can come inside.

407
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,040
- You cannot come inside.
- Hey!

408
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,480
Move.

409
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,400
- Get out…
- Sir…

410
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,880
Sir, please don't touch the students.

411
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,480
I will have to call the police.

412
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,240
Call who? Police…

413
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,520
Call whoever you want!

414
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,120
Bosco! Bosco!

415
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,240
Stop it. Stop it.

416
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,400
Only I am coming in.

417
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,720
You wait here.

418
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Only I am coming in.

419
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,120
Sorry, Sister.

420
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,880
- Hey, come on, show me your ID cards.
- Get lost!

421
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,480
Why are we discussing re-elections?

422
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,640
The management had
already taken a decision.

423
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,600
Changing it would be an insult
to the management.

424
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,840
Exactly.
The management took this decision.

425
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,040
Not the students.

426
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,600
She is not a candidate herself,

427
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,680
so why is she here?

428
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,760
- Hey!
- Hello!

429
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,120
You can't say that!

430
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,256
- Guys, Calm down.
- Look at how she's talking.

431
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,496
She can't just say anything she likes.

432
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,360
Silence, please.

433
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,536
- Guys.
- Please, have some respect.

434
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,880
- Guys.
- Quiet.

435
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,560
The Awaaz Committee represents

436
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,680
the voice of students
in every college in Goa.

437
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,120
She is here
because the students want her to be.

438
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,840
And why are you here, Ambika?

439
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,400
Majority of the students in this college

440
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,520
have nominated Ambika as their GS.

441
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,080
And we should take your word for it?

442
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,000
Management has elected Siddhi,

443
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,720
and the students have elected Ambika.

444
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,800
We have decided that the elections
will be held in ten days.

445
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,840
May the deserving candidate get elected.

446
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,680
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

447
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,840
She was going to meet us here, right?

448
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,280
Yes, stop here.

449
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,176
If you want to smoke the best stuff,

450
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,400
then convince her.

451
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:16,136
Otherwise, we'll have to settle
for the cheap stuff from Baga Beach.

452
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,360
Only she can arrange for it.

453
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,400
Isn't she a senior from our college?

454
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,120
Am I scared of seniors?

455
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,760
Ma'am. Ma'am.

456
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,120
Madam.

457
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,280
Your girl?

458
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,760
Yes, bro.

459
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,080
Rishika, right?

460
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,280
Yuva.

461
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,080
Whatever.
I don't have the time or mood.

462
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,480
I won't take much of your time,

463
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,400
and I don't want to spoil your mood.

464
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,000
Buzz off, bro.

465
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,496
- She is way out of your league.
- Do you want us to greet you?

466
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,000
Even I am above her league.

467
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,000
- What are you doing?
- I will tear you apart!

468
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,600
Whatever it may be,

469
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,200
spare us, unimportant people.

470
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,200
- Hey… what the hell?
- I won't let go.

471
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,320
But please,
can you supply us with some stuff?

472
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,600
Please.

473
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,960
It's my friend's send-off party.

474
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,440
According to my sources,

475
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,240
you received a special delivery
from Manali just yesterday.

476
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,320
Please.

477
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,776
We only want a little, ma'am.

478
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,640
- Very little, please. Tell her.
- Very little.

479
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,600
Why can't you keep your mouth shut?

480
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,040
You've made me a drug lord
in front of the entire college.

481
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
You're a freshie.

482
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,480
I've already said no to your friends.

483
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,320
Get lost.

484
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,160
I am not used to hearing no.

485
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,160
Then get used to it.

486
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,440
- Learn to share.
- Who are you?!

487
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,336
- Both love and friendship will grow.
- Get down!

488
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,360
That's not your car!

489
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,440
- Sorry
- Get off!

490
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,520
Sorry.

491
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,720
Rascal! I hope he didn't dent the car.

492
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,160
Yuva!

493
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,160
Yuva, come on, what are you doing?

494
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,400
You got what you wanted, right?
Let's go.

495
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,520
Wait!

496
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,600
Keep this.

497
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,480
Are you slow?
Didn't you understand?

498
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,680
I am not giving it to you.

499
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,040
I already snitched it from your bag.

500
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,720
I just didn't want to take it for free.

501
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,160
Keep the change.

502
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,440
- What...
- Keep it.

503
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,640
- Okay, bye.
- What the hell?

504
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,600
Wait. Hang on.

505
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,800
What is this?

506
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,680
I asked you politely,

507
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,040
but you refused.

508
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:13,920
So…

509
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,360
It is short of 2000.

510
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,920
I'll pay the rest soon, with interest.

511
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
With interest?

512
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,160
Yes.

513
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,040
This chapter has been omitted.
Which is the next one?

514
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,640
Fifty thousand species of animals,
that have…

515
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,840
Hi.

516
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,040
Hi.

517
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,360
Hi.

518
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,880
What's wrong?
Did you see a ghost?

519
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,360
I used to hang out here
before as well.

520
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,240
I'm coming.

521
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,280
- How are you?
- First class.

522
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,480
Aren't you going to ask me?

523
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,080
What's to ask?

524
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,000
Judging by your face,
I can see you are fuming.

525
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,040
Do you still miss me?

526
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,560
Sometimes.

527
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,320
But we broke up a long time ago.

528
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,880
Still, I do miss you sometimes.

529
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,920
I didn't talk about it to anyone.

530
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,160
I hooked up with a guy
the next day, you know.

531
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,960
And…?

532
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,560
And I realised…

533
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Siddhi, I…

534
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:56,080
I've realized what you mean to me.

535
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,360
Ambika.

536
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,200
The GS elections,

537
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,520
all this drama…

538
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,320
just to get back at me?

539
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,920
Don't do it, Ambika.

540
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,200
Do you really think I did
all this to get back at you?

541
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,920
The students nominated me, Siddhi.

542
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,880
This was their demand.

543
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,840
These students don't know
what they want.

544
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,160
Please…

545
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,440
Don't listen to the idiots around you
and let them take you for a ride.

546
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,640
Look, Ambika,

547
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,840
you know what this post means for me.

548
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,280
You know, right?

549
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:41,000
I know you won't do
anything to hurt me.

550
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,080
You won't, right?

551
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,840
Okay…

552
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,440
She won't back out.

553
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,800
She will contest the election.

554
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,840
Since the fifth grade,
I have never missed her birthday.

555
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,776
Do you remember your mom's birthday?

556
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,000
Stop showing off.

557
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,240
Hey, quiet!

558
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,736
His situation, I get,
but who are you here for?

559
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,496
His love story has been going on
since fifth grade.

560
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,520
Have you lost it?

561
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,680
Mine will start now.

562
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,800
Don't be crazy.

563
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,640
Bro…

564
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,800
Hey, hero.

565
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,000
Where to?

566
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,520
Guruji, what brings you here?

567
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,400
The matron's quarters are over there.

568
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,976
You're looking for a fresher, right?

569
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,160
Their rooms are on this side.

570
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,760
Seems like he has a membership.

571
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,480
Quietly do your work and leave.

572
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,080
- This one.
- This one?

573
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,520
- Yeah.
- Go, make me proud.

574
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,040
- Happy Birthday.
- Oh, my God. You came!

575
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,000
- Come inside.
- You...

576
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:08,920
Thank you, Yuva.

577
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,200
I can't believe you came.

578
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,600
What did you get me?

579
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,120
Hey, you.

580
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,920
Rumor has it
the coffee is really good here.

581
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,720
Never give up in life. Yes!

582
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Ma'am.

583
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,560
Ma'am.

584
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,640
Are you lost?

585
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,600
This is the girl's hostel.

586
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,240
Should I tell the matron

587
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,520
to give you a guided tour?

588
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:42,160
Ma'am, I am doing a good service.

589
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,560
Uniting a friend with his love.

590
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,200
You don't believe me?

591
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,040
Come on.

592
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,280
This meeting has become X-rated.

593
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,000
Who could ever control their hormones?

594
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,440
Ten more minutes and we will leave.

595
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,800
Ten minutes?

596
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,240
Your boy will be done in three.

597
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,080
Then, let's start a joint account
for three minutes.

598
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,520
If I find it interesting,

599
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,840
we can make it five.

600
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
What are you doing here?

601
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,736
Why aren't you answering my calls?

602
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,760
Bala,

603
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,576
the matron will see us.
Let's talk in the morning.

604
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,600
I want to talk now.

605
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,480
- Why are you avoiding me?
- I am not avoiding you.

606
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,136
I just need some time to think.

607
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,200
What have I done?

608
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,576
You didn't do anything, Bala.

609
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,136
- Then why are you behaving like this?
- Bala!

610
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,520
- Do I look stupid to you?
- Hey…

611
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,240
Bala.

612
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,200
Is everything alright?

613
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,400
Get lost.

614
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,760
She doesn't want to talk to you,
so you leave.

615
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,640
Look, this is between Ritu and me.

616
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,920
Don't interfere.

617
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Bala,

618
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,680
I've had enough.

619
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,560
Now leave.

620
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,120
Please, leave for now.

621
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,040
How long have you been doing this?

622
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,960
I think my first smoke
was in twelfth grade.

623
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,440
I wasn't talking about this, idiot.

624
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:24,040
I meant uniting hormonally
challenged lovers.

625
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:25,680
How long?

626
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,240
This…

627
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,400
Since childhood.

628
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,840
Childhood?

629
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,480
Please explain.

630
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,280
Mom and Dad had gone for
a night show of <i>Karan Arjun.</i>

631
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,960
- "My Karan and Arjun will come…"
- Exactly. That one.

632
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,920
When Salman made an entry,

633
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,800
I kicked for the first time.

634
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,000
The generous side in me is very strong.

635
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,040
I never say no to anyone.

636
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,040
So… do you help everyone,

637
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,680
or does anyone ever help you?

638
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,400
I have many,

639
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,160
but I never needed
anyone's help in life.

640
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,920
Not even once?

641
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,400
Like… never?

642
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,960
Never.

643
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,680
Yuva!

644
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,600
Thief… thief!
Catch him!

645
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,480
- Call the warden!
- Somebody call the warden!

646
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,120
Hey, run!

647
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,040
Oh, hi.

648
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,400
Okay, bye.

649
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,960
Run, Yuva!

650
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,560
Close the door.

651
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,400
Hey, stop there!

652
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,760
Stop… Stop.
Where are you going?

653
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:35,960
What were you doing?

654
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,720
Hey!
Hit him!

655
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,960
Don't let them go. Catch them.

656
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,080
Beat him.

657
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,240
Stop.

658
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,920
- Run, bro.
- Stop… Stop!

659
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,360
Let go.

660
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,680
<i>Welcome to the fresher's party.</i>

661
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,800
I know you are here from
different parts of the country to study.

662
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,120
To make an identity.

663
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,000
In the beginning,
you might need some time

664
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,400
to feel accepted.

665
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,760
<i>But it won't take too long
in this particular college.</i>

666
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,600
<i>Because we are one
and not diverse.</i>

667
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:06,920
There is one voice
against every trouble.

668
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,360
<i>Hell month is over.</i>

669
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,160
So, from today, there will be
no unnecessary fighting.

670
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,160
Freshers and seniors are brothers.

671
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,080
<i>Are you ready?</i>

672
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,960
<i>Let's see you freshers move.</i>

673
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,040
<i>Makes my heart pound</i>

674
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,240
<i>Whistles at me</i>

675
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,320
<i>She makes my heart pound</i>

676
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,040
<i>Whistles at me</i>

677
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,960
<i>Calls out my name
In the middle of the street</i>

678
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,560
<i>She makes gestures</i>

679
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,600
<i>And then she winks at me</i>

680
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,800
<i>Winks at me</i>

681
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,960
<i>And then she winks at me</i>

682
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,840
<i>Winks at me…</i>

683
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:58,920
Hey!

684
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,560
Hey, <i>Karan Arjun.</i>

685
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,200
No love lost couples to unite today?

686
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,880
I am thinking of focusing
on myself today.

687
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,520
Like doctors in the movies say…

688
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,480
Only prayers can help you now.

689
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:17,120
If you are my prayer,
I'll accept you.

690
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,880
Good God.

691
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,080
<i>And then she winks at me</i>

692
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,240
<i>Winks at me</i>

693
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,200
<i>And then she winks at me</i>

694
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,200
<i>Winks at me</i>

695
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,000
<i>And then she winks at me</i>

696
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,160
<i>Winks at me</i>

697
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,120
<i>And then she winks at me</i>

698
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,840
Freshers, pay your respects to the man,

699
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:39,960
the legend,
our very own super senior.

700
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:43,760
Xavier Dominic Coutino.

701
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,640
Are you ready?

702
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,680
Time to start the real party.

703
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:52,520
Put your hands up in the air.

704
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,640
Let's see you freshers move.

705
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,280
Hey…

706
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,600
Remember me?

707
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,800
Yuvraj.

708
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,040
Yuvraj Khera.

709
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,720
Sunbeam High School.

710
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,240
Remember?

711
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,320
Remember now?

712
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,480
He must have been ten years old.

713
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,800
He used to call me "Brother."

714
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,040
I thought he was my friend.

715
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,200
<i>What a friend he turned out to be!</i>

716
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,600
It was just us
at the boarding that time.

717
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,640
<i>School wouldn't reopen
for two more weeks.</i>

718
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,840
He would miss his family.

719
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,000
<i>He used to cry all day.</i>

720
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,040
He hung around with me all day.

721
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,120
Then, one day, everyone returned.

722
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,200
The senior students immediately...

723
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,800
My seniors told me

724
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,840
to bring him for an introduction.

725
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,120
<i>So, I took him there.</i>

726
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,960
He knew I was small.

727
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:43,960
I was new to the school.

728
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,320
<i>I wouldn't be able to fight them.</i>

729
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,960
<i>I wouldn't be able to stop them.</i>

730
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,440
But he still took me there.

731
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:56,800
They were my seniors.

732
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,880
I thought they would have some fun.

733
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:06,120
<i>I tried to stop them.</i>

734
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,720
<i>They didn't stop.</i>

735
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,520
They were animals.

736
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,920
I kept screaming,

737
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,280
<i>shouting for help!</i>

738
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:21,720
<i>But they didn't stop.</i>

739
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,040
<i>They molested me.</i>

740
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,000
I kept looking into Xavier's eyes

741
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:30,920
<i>and screaming his name.</i>

742
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Brother, please!

743
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,040
Kept asking for help.

744
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,320
<i>But he just watched in silence!</i>

745
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,040
I was scared.

746
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,600
If the warden hadn't arrived on time…

747
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:59,320
Because of the warden's complaint,
even I got suspended with the seniors.

748
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,000
When I came back,
I found out…

749
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:05,720
I left boarding school.

750
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,400
I didn't even leave the house for a year.

751
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,760
I could never forget his
innocent, helpless face.

752
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,080
It was my fault.

753
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:21,920
No, Zee.

754
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:23,880
You were young as well.

755
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,800
What happened to him was wrong,

756
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:29,560
but it wasn't your fault.

757
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:30,640
It was my fault.

758
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,520
I should have tried harder.

759
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,360
I should have done something.

760
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,040
Coming to this college,

761
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:43,680
coming face-to-face with him,

762
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:45,640
it's not a coincidence.

763
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,080
He will have to pay

764
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,920
for what he did.

765
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:03,680
TOASTY FRIENDSHIP

766
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:04,880
Fine.

767
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,240
I'll take care of it.

768
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:08,600
- Namaste.
- Thank you.

769
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:09,680
Come on, let's go.

770
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:12,600
I sent Ambika home.

771
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,280
She is not coming back.

772
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,280
What did you do?

773
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:17,560
What did you do?

774
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:18,960
I did what I had to.

775
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:21,600
Don't call her.

776
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:24,520
Forget about her.

777
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:27,840
The GS post is yours.

778
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:31,160
Focus on that
and I will handle the rest.

779
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,760
<i>I've spoken to all four trustees,</i>

780
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,400
sent a Rolex to the chairman,

781
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,320
personally got approval
for the new library,

782
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:46,280
spoke to the Dean at his home,

783
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,120
and still, they are not
making you the GS?

784
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:49,600
They are demanding an election.

785
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,240
What does it mean?

786
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:53,160
Don't worry, Father.

787
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:54,640
I am going to win.

788
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:56,640
Why worry?

789
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,960
I have control over them.

790
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:03,480
But you have no control
over the students.

791
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,400
I can see that.

792
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:12,240
Bhau.

793
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,920
What are you doing
about the Siddhi case?

794
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:18,720
Does Bhau need
to do every little thing?

795
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,400
Don't worry. I will solve it.

796
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:23,520
Solve it?

797
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:25,360
How?

798
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:28,720
The college…

799
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:31,840
Through threats?

800
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,200
Waving a gun?

801
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:39,160
Everyone in college accuses
my party of causing riots.

802
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,400
Relax, Bhau.

803
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,480
Siddhi will win the elections.

804
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:46,400
In ten years' time,

805
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:49,200
I want to see her
as the chief minister of Goa.

806
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:51,800
If she loses the college elections,

807
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,000
how is she going to win?

808
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,040
She will win.

809
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,680
What is this idiot doing here?

810
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:07,800
Go…

811
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:09,080
handle him.

812
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:17,640
Yes?

813
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:20,160
I've been waiting for over an hour.

814
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,280
Where is Bhau?

815
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,440
We set your interview
in Ponda College.

816
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:25,880
What else do you want?

817
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:27,400
I don't want to talk to you.

818
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:29,440
Fifteen years…

819
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:32,400
For fifteen years, I supported Bhau
in every trustee election.

820
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,456
- And he can't spare 15 minutes for me?!
- Rascal…

821
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,480
- Stop screaming.
- Bosco!

822
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:37,280
Leave it, Bosco.

823
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,280
Know your limits, idiot.

824
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:43,320
You supported my father all these years

825
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:44,960
because your interest lay in it.

826
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,000
They fired you from the college now.

827
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,240
You are no good to him now,
and still, he is helping you.

828
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,040
- I don't need his help.
- Hey!

829
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:53,120
- Hey!
- Hey!

830
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,440
What?

831
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:56,080
You don't need his help, right? Okay.

832
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:59,120
I'll see which college
employs you now.

833
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:01,640
Come on, Bosco.

834
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:04,480
Next time, keep the volume down.

835
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:06,560
Get it through his head.

836
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,160
Even girls are insulting us now.

837
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,480
We're nothing more than idiots.

838
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,080
And it's all because of that Gayatri.

839
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,480
I have to beg for my own job.

840
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:24,840
Gayatri needs to be taught a lesson.

841
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:28,280
Even though she's from another caste,
she seems to have forgotten her limits.

842
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,280
What has happened to Ambika?

843
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:32,440
No one knows exactly.

844
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,520
Only that Ambika has left the city.

845
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:37,040
- When?
- Two days ago.

846
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:38,360
Ambika's roommate said that

847
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:42,080
some goons from Mukul Sawant's party
showed up, packed all her stuff, and left.

848
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:43,040
What about her phone?

849
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:44,120
It's switched off.

850
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:46,880
And the admin block received
a request for TC,

851
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,600
and Ambika's signatures are on it.

852
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:49,840
Hey…

853
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,120
- Stop. Stop.
- Gayatri!

854
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:52,320
Are you alright?

855
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:53,440
- Are you hurt?
- Vikas!

856
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,840
- Vikas, come quickly.
- Gayu! Gayu!

857
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:57,376
- Are you okay?
- Let's go to the hospital.

858
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:58,400
Are you okay?

859
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:00,760
Are you okay?

860
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:02,240
Gayatri.

861
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:03,440
Let's go from here.

862
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:23,840
Get out. Get out.

863
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:41,280
For Gayatri?

864
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:44,320
No.

865
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,480
For me.

866
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:03,520
Hey!

867
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,280
Zee!

868
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:33,920
Zee!

869
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:09,640
Zee!

870
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,240
Zee!

871
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:31,320
Zee!

872
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:32,600
Zee! Zee!

873
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:33,800
Zee! Zee!

874
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:35,440
- Zee! Zee!
- Come on, Zee! Yes!

875
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:40,600
Who asked you?

876
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,120
Who asked you to do this?

877
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:44,280
There's no need
to be the hero all the time.

878
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:45,840
Gayu, let it be.

879
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:47,160
He is in pain already.

880
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:48,760
Rish, be quiet.

881
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:49,960
And you.

882
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:52,440
Do you know of any way
other than violence?

883
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:59,360
Someone hits you on the head
with a bottle, and I should do nothing?

884
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:01,280
I was hit.
I will handle it.

885
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:02,880
Fine.

886
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:04,320
Fine? What is fine?

887
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,880
- Then why did you do it?
- Because your problem is my problem.

888
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:21,040
World politics, communalism,
capitalism, economics,

889
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:23,960
you understand all of that well,
but not this.

890
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:26,600
Fine.

891
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:28,400
You'll understand someday.

892
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:30,760
Until then, I'll wait.

893
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:33,760
Come, Farheed.

894
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:42,240
Let's go.
Forget it.

895
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:45,440
<i>First defender, under his right foot…</i>

896
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:53,520
Listen, boys. Listen. Listen.

897
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:55,760
There is a girl in our hostel.

898
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,160
Come on!

899
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:15,800
Get out, all of y'all!

900
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:17,160
Move!

901
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:26,880
Please!

902
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:56,880
- Vikas.
- Yes?

903
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,360
Who spoke to Ambika last?

904
00:54:58,440 --> 00:54:59,720
Her phone is switched off.

905
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:03,480
- Is he still the SHO there?
- Yes, that same fatso. Ashutosh Mhatre.

906
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:05,640
Okay, will the lawyer
be there before us?

907
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:07,520
Don't worry.
She will be there on time.

908
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,440
I think we should head
towards Ambika's village.

909
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:12,720
Yes, let's go to the police first,
then we'll see.

910
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:18,936
Sir, we want to file
a missing person's report.

911
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:19,960
Name, Ambika Mahar.

912
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:21,120
Final year medical student.

913
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:22,200
St. Martin's College.

914
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,920
We've been unable to contact her
for the past four days.

915
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,376
And her phone is also switched off.

916
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,176
She was competing
for the college GS position.

917
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:31,280
I am sure someone has orchestrated
her disappearance for political gain.

918
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:32,920
Please file a report.

919
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:35,720
And inform the police station
closest to her house.

920
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:38,920
Ma'am, where is your uniform?

921
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:41,960
Police uniform.

922
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:44,360
Why don't you sit here?

923
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:46,000
And do my job.

924
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,440
Do I look stupid to you?

925
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:59,040
Don't try to explain to the police
what their job is.

926
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:01,960
You'll tell me how to do my job? Get lost!

927
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,120
Her hometown is Karvar,
which we know.

928
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:06,880
But we have to find the exact address.

929
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,400
I know her exact address.

930
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:09,920
Ambika Mahar, right?

931
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:13,240
I can take you there.

932
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:22,640
Thank you for coming for
Kabir's third memorial service.

933
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:25,240
It's been…

934
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:30,320
exactly three years since Mom
and Kabir passed away.

935
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:33,880
And we still miss him very much.

936
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,040
Not only was he my brother,

937
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:39,480
he was also the lifeline of this college.

938
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:42,560
He touched many lives.

939
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,520
<i>A lot of us owe a lot to him.</i>

940
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:49,960
Kabir suffered from manic depression.

941
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:56,360
Mom's cancer only
aggravated his condition.

942
00:56:57,360 --> 00:57:00,160
<i>And none of us could
do anything to help him.</i>

943
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:02,720
<i>We could not understand him.</i>

944
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,400
Two days after Mom passed,

945
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:09,400
Kabir hung himself.

946
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:14,200
And…

947
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:29,360
Kabir and Mom…

948
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,200
I am sure wherever they are,

949
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,240
they must be together.

950
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:43,720
They must be laughing as always…

951
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:44,880
Together.

952
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,280
Leaving me alone here.

953
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:50,720
At least hear her out.

954
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,160
- I am talking politely.
- Who do you think you are?!

955
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:55,280
One moment, at least hear me out!

956
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:58,600
Don't make it worse!

957
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:00,520
Forgive us.

958
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:02,200
Do you want to quarrel?

959
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:04,720
I told you to leave.

960
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:07,520
You cannot meet Ambika.

961
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:08,800
No means no!

962
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,000
Please let us live peacefully.

963
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,720
Is that possible in this lifetime?

964
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:17,560
- Please leave.
- Please, go!

965
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:18,920
Please leave.

966
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:20,120
- I said leave.
- Listen,

967
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:22,680
if we don't rise together,
they will keep suppressing us.

968
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,600
They can't decide
how we live our lives.

969
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:27,240
So it's important to fight.

970
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:29,360
I don't want to fight.

971
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:33,080
Please leave, Gayatri.
I don't want to talk to you.

972
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,296
Ambika, you are the hope
for thousands of students.

973
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:37,016
What are you going to tell them?
That you were scared of a threat.

974
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:38,480
Does this look like a threat to you?

975
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,120
I've come to remind you.

976
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:59,000
Are you done?

977
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:00,600
Come on, get lost.

978
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:15,320
Are you here to scare me?

979
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:21,480
Bosco, what are you doing?

980
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:22,600
Are you out of your mind?

981
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,400
You want to fight us?

982
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:25,736
What are you doing?
Have you lost it?

983
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:28,160
- Let me go.
- You'll contest Siddhi in the election?

984
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,280
What is this, Bosco?

985
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:31,680
Leave me.

986
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:36,560
We let people like you sit next to us,

987
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,280
and you want to exceed us.

988
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:41,640
Did you forget your place?

989
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:43,960
I came to remind you.

990
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,200
We have to report this, Ambika.

991
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:54,680
We cannot let this go.

992
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:56,560
I don't want to do anything.

993
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:59,080
And I am not coming back.

994
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:03,040
I am all they have.

995
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:05,280
Try to understand.

996
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:06,976
Your heart's going
to ask you every day

997
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,400
why you gave up without a fight.

998
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:10,320
If not for the world,

999
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:12,240
prepare an answer for yourself.

1000
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:15,280
I don't have to answer to anyone.

1001
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:19,600
Please, leave.

1002
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,680
Madam, are you done?

1003
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Aren't you?

1004
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:25,160
Leave.

1005
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:26,640
Please, leave.

1006
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:28,440
Go.

1007
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:31,560
Call me if you change your mind.

1008
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:34,560
Go…

1009
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:38,600
Let's go.

1010
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:53,920
Don't give up so easily.

1011
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:07,880
For accompanying us,
and believing in us,

1012
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:08,960
I want to thank you.

1013
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:11,880
I didn't come here for your cause.

1014
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:13,560
Then?

1015
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:16,240
I came here for you.

1016
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:19,120
How sweet!

1017
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:20,960
Not you.

1018
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:22,400
You, Gayatri.

1019
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,480
But you don't even know me.

1020
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:29,040
I want to get to know you.

1021
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:31,720
What do you mean?

1022
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:33,560
You are a friend of Xavier's.

1023
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,800
I want to know Xavier's friends closely.

1024
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:40,160
We have an old score to settle.

1025
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,360
So you are that Yuva.

1026
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:46,280
I couldn't connect the dots earlier.

1027
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:52,240
The plan was to hurt him by hurting you.

1028
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:54,560
Evil, right?

1029
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:56,600
Hurt?

1030
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:58,080
Are you going to beat me up,

1031
01:01:58,320 --> 01:01:59,640
or hurt me emotionally?

1032
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,480
I've aborted that plan for now.

1033
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:27,440
Mom, Rish and me…

1034
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:31,280
We never cared about tomorrow.

1035
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:37,120
We lived like…

1036
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:40,160
we were undefeated.

1037
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:42,880
Mom could have fought harder.

1038
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:47,440
But she chose to stop.

1039
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:50,840
She just gave up and now she's gone

1040
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:54,720
Now I must live with this truth.

1041
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:04,080
But how can I live with this truth, Zee?

1042
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:25,200
By the way, that memorial today

1043
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:27,160
was for your ex-boyfriend, right?

1044
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:30,840
I have a question.

1045
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:32,840
Why did you go on this mission

1046
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:34,800
rather than being here?

1047
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:39,560
Unless it was a planned distraction.

1048
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:52,080
Yuva?

1049
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:54,600
How about some dinner?

1050
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:56,400
I am starving.

1051
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:58,520
Come inside.

1052
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:02,720
- Can I help?
- No, it's okay. Grab a plate.

1053
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:05,080
- Where is G?
- She's coming, she was right behind me.

1054
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:06,400
Hi.

1055
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:08,200
- Hi.
- Hi.

1056
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:10,000
- Where were you?
- Long story.

1057
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:11,760
- Did you eat?
- No,

1058
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:13,240
- not yet.
- I'll get something.

1059
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:36,280
Let's eat something.

1060
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:41,120
Everything's veg.

1061
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:42,800
Doesn't matter.

1062
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:24,120
How was the memorial?

1063
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:28,520
Zee, I didn't want to be there.

1064
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:31,840
I can't do this.

1065
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:33,240
I can't either.

1066
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:37,480
But I was here because I think

1067
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:39,160
that was the right thing to do.

1068
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:42,400
And I feel that
you should have been here as well.

1069
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:46,680
But the point is that you don't care.

1070
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:49,720
And you come back now
when it's all over.

1071
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:52,440
And…

1072
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:54,120
And what?

1073
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:57,320
With an uninvited guest.

1074
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:02,600
This is my house.

1075
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:05,400
I can do whatever I want.
Invite anyone I want.

1076
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:06,960
That's true.

1077
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:10,160
Do what you want.

1078
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:13,240
I don't care.

1079
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:16,960
But, not today.

1080
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:19,920
Guys, please stop this.

1081
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:21,416
You have a personal problem with him.

1082
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:23,040
I don't have a personal
problem with him.

1083
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:24,960
Then why are you
creating a scene?

1084
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:26,336
- I am not creating a scene.
- Zee!

1085
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:28,640
- My friend hung himself!
- Rish!

1086
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:31,280
I couldn't help.

1087
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:32,760
I couldn't do anything.

1088
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:34,280
Stop it.

1089
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:36,400
She couldn't give one day for Kabir!

1090
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:38,400
This is not a competition,

1091
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:40,360
of who loves Kabir more.

1092
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:42,160
Who gives more time for him,

1093
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:43,600
or who misses him more?

1094
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:45,320
He is dead.

1095
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:46,880
- He is dead.
- Rish!

1096
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:48,480
- Do you get it?
- Rish, calm down.

1097
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:51,360
He didn't expect anything.

1098
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:55,480
Especially not to see his two
best friends fight like cats and dogs.

1099
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:57,760
- I…
- Rish.

1100
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:28,560
Kabir was as special to me
as he was to you.

1101
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:32,000
It pains me every day that he's gone.

1102
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:36,200
But the truth is that
he was suffering.

1103
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:39,720
And we couldn't do anything to help.

1104
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:31,640
Get up, you rabbit.

1105
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:37,000
I came here to talk.

1106
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:39,840
I was having a bad dream.

1107
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
But I guess I'll have a bad day now.

1108
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:44,400
I need to talk.

1109
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:45,960
Leave me.

1110
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:52,160
I don't want to.

1111
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:53,960
Look, Yuvi.

1112
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:57,520
Whatever happened,
happened many years ago.

1113
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:00,520
I know you are still angry,

1114
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:02,560
and I am here to fix it.

1115
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:05,200
I came to apologize.

1116
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:07,800
Mr. Xavier,

1117
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:10,240
forgiveness is a precious commodity.

1118
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:13,400
Which I sparingly give.

1119
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:18,040
Bala. Bala. Bala

1120
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:34,360
All these years
you didn't think about it.

1121
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:36,056
Now that I came to this college,

1122
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:37,160
came face to face with you,

1123
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:38,320
you want to apologize?

1124
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:49,080
People remember good memories,

1125
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:52,360
but I remember that day,

1126
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:54,280
that moment.

1127
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:02,720
It's so deeply engraved inside me,

1128
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:04,160
whatever I do,

1129
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:06,160
I can't let go of it.

1130
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:20,000
So take your apology and get lost.

1131
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:22,480
What happened to you was wrong.

1132
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:25,400
I was helpless.

1133
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:36,360
And that's why I was apologizing.

1134
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:37,680
I don't want it.

1135
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:39,520
I'm not in the mood for it.

1136
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:47,320
Fine, you can be that way
if you want to.

1137
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:52,120
But don't involve my friends.

1138
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:58,800
Yes.

1139
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:00,080
There's the real you.

1140
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:09,560
By friends you mean Rishika, Gayatri.

1141
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:17,120
I will alienate them
from you one by one.

1142
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:21,560
Listen…

1143
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:24,640
don't push me.

1144
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:29,840
That's what I am here to do.

1145
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:32,720
And I will keep doing it.

1146
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:35,840
Till you don't push me back.

1147
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:44,720
Because that's what I want.

1148
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:53,640
Where are you going, bro?

1149
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:00,560
Remember one thing.

1150
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:03,560
Whatever you start, I will end it.

1151
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:05,840
Get lost.

1152
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:07,840
You will end it.

1153
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:08,960
Get lost.

1154
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:17,880
LOVE AND ROMANCE

1155
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:21,480
<i>…gastroenteritis affects the stomach
and intestines.</i>

1156
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:22,800
The bones in your skull

1157
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:25,920
can be divided into cranial bones
which form your cranium

1158
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,560
- Hurry up!
- And the facial bones

1159
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:28,880
- which make up your f...
- Sir!

1160
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,120
- What?
- It's urgent. I got to go.

1161
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:33,160
Me too, sir.
My stomach's upset as well.

1162
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:34,376
Are you two going to shit together?

1163
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:36,200
Please, sir.
Or I'll shit in my pants.

1164
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:37,336
I already shat in my pants, sir.

1165
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:39,000
Yuck, just go.

1166
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:43,640
- Quickly!
- Water! Water!

1167
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:44,720
- Anu?
- Sir.

1168
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:47,880
- Careful.
- No water now…

1169
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:50,800
- Somebody call the ambulance. Quickly!
- Go, go.

1170
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:52,400
Harsh, get the bike.

1171
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:53,760
C'mon, c'mon

1172
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:55,240
Move. Move.

1173
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:57,720
- Guys, guys!
- Move. Move.

1174
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:14,480
You'll be woozy for a while,
but you'll be fine, okay?

1175
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:21,000
I am such a big loser.

1176
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,680
What's wrong with you?
Why do you say that?

1177
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:26,560
I can't do anything properly.

1178
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:29,200
I can't believe I overdosed.

1179
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:31,680
This is so embarrassing.

1180
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:33,120
It's not embarrassing.

1181
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:34,680
Nothing is going to happen.

1182
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:38,800
That's exactly my problem.

1183
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:42,200
Nothing is ever going to happen.

1184
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:45,200
I love you so much.

1185
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:49,040
Nothing is ever going
to happen between us.

1186
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:51,040
I love you too, buddy.

1187
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:58,680
You don't mean it the way I do, Rish.

1188
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:01,080
Leave it, Rish.

1189
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:02,320
There is no difference.

1190
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:05,000
You just need to relax right now.

1191
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:07,320
You know that I love you.

1192
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:12,480
But you love… this Yuva guy.

1193
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:18,280
And obviously,
even he's got feelings for you.

1194
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:22,000
It's not what you think.

1195
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:23,680
Just shut up and sleep
right now, okay?

1196
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:26,160
- You'll be fine.
- I am telling you, Rish.

1197
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:28,040
Don't date this guy.

1198
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:30,520
He will break your heart in two days.

1199
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:31,800
And you'll be crying.

1200
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:35,680
- Anu, what is wrong?
- Shut up.

1201
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:37,240
Anu! What is wrong with Anu?

1202
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:38,640
What is wrong, Anu?

1203
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:39,600
Are you okay?

1204
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:41,160
She's okay.
But what's wrong with you?

1205
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:43,640
What if something had happened to her?

1206
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:46,000
Then you would be hanging
out with the girl on that bed.

1207
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:50,080
You don't know the power of true love.

1208
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:51,920
Right, Anu?

1209
01:14:58,480 --> 01:14:59,480
Don't say anything.

1210
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:01,560
I wasn't going to.

1211
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:04,320
It's because of the pills or powder

1212
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:05,680
or something else she had taken.

1213
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:07,480
She didn't know what she was saying.

1214
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:09,240
Just some stupid rant.

1215
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,000
I don't…

1216
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:13,440
I don't feel…

1217
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:15,080
I don't have anything.

1218
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:16,240
You know, right?

1219
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:17,880
Of course.

1220
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:19,920
Neither do I.

1221
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:23,400
You're just cute, that's it.

1222
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:29,000
You're supposed to say it back.

1223
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:32,680
Stop fishing, Rish.

1224
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:35,000
The entire college knows
how cute you are.

1225
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:38,280
You don't need to hear it from me.

1226
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:40,960
Coffee?

1227
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:43,000
We're already having it.

1228
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:44,320
Not this.

1229
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:46,080
I mean someplace else.

1230
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:47,680
The good stuff.

1231
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:50,800
- What if I say no?
- I will be heartbroken.

1232
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:54,200
But I will try again next week.

1233
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:58,200
Zee…

1234
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:00,680
How much longer are you going
to pretend…

1235
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:02,960
to study, and finish college?

1236
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:08,760
As long as you keep
trying to bring a revolution.

1237
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:12,720
Please, we both know who is
pretending and who is actually working.

1238
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:16,240
The freshers will finish their PG

1239
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:18,080
and build their own hospital.

1240
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:19,400
And you will still be here.

1241
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:22,920
I have several reasons to be here.

1242
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:24,640
I couldn't hear you.

1243
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:28,280
I have many reasons to be here!

1244
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:29,920
Like?

1245
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:33,720
Like, Kabir…

1246
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:36,240
The people.

1247
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:39,520
The essence of this college.

1248
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:42,960
And the biggest reason of all…

1249
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:45,880
is you.

1250
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:52,880
Really?

1251
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:54,440
And what if I leave?

1252
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:56,400
Will you come with me?

1253
01:18:57,400 --> 01:18:58,400
To where?

1254
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:03,320
To take Awaaz out of Goa
and spread it all over the country.

1255
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:05,240
Bigger causes.

1256
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:07,240
Bigger fights.

1257
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:08,480
Bigger reasons.

1258
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:12,000
So, the entire nation
has to hear your voice now.

1259
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:14,200
Every corner.

1260
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:18,080
Listen, Zee.

1261
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:21,040
Forsake this anger, this violence.

1262
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:24,000
Study. Be someone.

1263
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:26,240
For us.

1264
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:27,840
For me.

1265
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:29,360
For yourself.

1266
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:33,920
Everyone in college
thinks you're a hero.

1267
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:37,280
For all the wrong reasons.

1268
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,520
Then give them the right reasons.

1269
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:47,440
And what if I give you
the right reason?

1270
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:51,120
Then I will elope with you.

1271
01:19:56,280 --> 01:19:57,880
Then get ready to elope.

1272
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:02,720
I had a great time.

1273
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:04,680
Me too.

1274
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:07,760
That's me.

1275
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:17,440
Okay, then.

1276
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:21,200
If I do it, there is no stopping.

1277
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:23,720
Then don't.

1278
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:26,240
What's stopping you?

1279
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:35,600
What I want is you, Rishika.

1280
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:39,280
I want you so bad that it scares me.

1281
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:29,760
I have finally submitted my paper.
So I have got these sweets for Gayatri.

1282
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:31,000
I'll make sure she gets it.

1283
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:32,600
Gayatri-ji.

1284
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:35,640
<i>- Long live…
- Our Bhau!</i>

1285
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:38,360
THE ATTACK

1286
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:40,720
- Long live…
- Our Bhau!

1287
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,200
- Long live…
- Our Bhau!

1288
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:45,600
- Long live…
- Our Bhau!

1289
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:48,120
- Long live…
- Our Bhau!

1290
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:50,800
- Long live…
- Our Bhau!

1291
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,160
- Long live…
- Our Bhau!

1292
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:55,560
- Long live…
- Our Bhau!

1293
01:22:56,160 --> 01:22:58,240
- Long live…
- Our Bhau!

1294
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:00,680
- Long live…
- Our Bhau!

1295
01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:02,960
- Long live…
- Our Bhau!

1296
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:04,480
Presenting to you,

1297
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:07,160
the new president
of the youth wing.

1298
01:23:07,680 --> 01:23:09,880
Siddhi Mukul Sawant.

1299
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:13,120
This day is special for me.

1300
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:16,080
Our party has bestowed my daughter

1301
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:18,240
with an important responsibility

1302
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:20,000
as the youth leader.

1303
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:22,960
And not because she is my daughter.

1304
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:28,600
But because she deserves the title.

1305
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:31,360
Gayatri had come

1306
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:32,760
with a lawyer

1307
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:34,840
to ask about Ambika.

1308
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:36,000
But honestly…

1309
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:38,520
- but I didn't entertain!
- Today, I'm a little sad.

1310
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:41,320
She has a lot of enthusiasm now.

1311
01:23:42,040 --> 01:23:43,560
She wants to file an FIR.

1312
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,080
Why an FIR?

1313
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:48,080
Don't you know what happened?

1314
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:49,200
No.

1315
01:23:50,240 --> 01:23:52,400
Bosco burnt her hand with acid.

1316
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:54,440
She's in a bad condition.

1317
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:57,256
- Where is she now? I'll deal with her.
- Shut up.

1318
01:23:57,280 --> 01:23:58,600
- Bosco.
- Shut up!

1319
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:00,800
I will pray to God…

1320
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:03,000
Don't make a scene here.

1321
01:24:04,160 --> 01:24:05,400
It's that GS post you want.

1322
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,160
I will get it for you.

1323
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:11,840
You focus here,
I will take care of the rest.

1324
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:14,040
Message from the trustee.
Double celebration.

1325
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:17,240
Looking at Siddhi's fantastic work,

1326
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:21,840
she has been appointed
as the GS of St. Martin College.

1327
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:24,200
- Long live…
- Siddhi Sawant!

1328
01:24:24,280 --> 01:24:26,640
- Long live…
- Siddhi Sawant!

1329
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:29,080
- Long live…
- Siddhi Sawant!

1330
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:31,360
Gayu, I have some good news.

1331
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:33,040
- Congratulations, bro.
- Hey, thanks!

1332
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:34,760
- Listen…
- Congratulations.

1333
01:24:34,840 --> 01:24:35,840
No, not like this.

1334
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:37,120
Come over to the shack.

1335
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:38,656
- I'll cook for you.
- Congratulations

1336
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:39,680
Thanks!

1337
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:42,080
And listen,
finish all your work before coming.

1338
01:24:43,640 --> 01:24:46,000
And please leave
the Awaaz Committee behind.

1339
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:47,480
Okay?

1340
01:24:48,240 --> 01:24:49,240
I will wait for you.

1341
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:56,600
Those who are done, you're done!
This?

1342
01:24:56,680 --> 01:24:58,320
- I want black.
- Black? Black?

1343
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Sister, black.

1344
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:02,000
Here, take blue.

1345
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:03,600
Sister, give me black.

1346
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:06,920
I want black.

1347
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:10,440
I somehow gathered
the courage and reached here.

1348
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:14,280
But now, I am scared, Gayatri.

1349
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:16,360
Very scared.

1350
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,840
But if I don't fight for my rights now,

1351
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:21,600
I'll be scared all my life.

1352
01:25:23,640 --> 01:25:24,880
I want to fight.

1353
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:27,200
Not I, but we.

1354
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:47,960
I want to file an FIR against
Bosco Salgaonkar and Siddhi Sawant.

1355
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:49,240
Attempt to murder.

1356
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,281
Lab reports which state
third-degree burns caused by acid.

1357
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:54,176
A video clip recorded
at the scene of the crime,

1358
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:55,400
featuring Bosco Salgaonkar.

1359
01:25:55,880 --> 01:25:56,880
We're submitting both.

1360
01:25:58,480 --> 01:26:00,400
Now, we can file an FIR, right?

1361
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:10,400
St. Martin's final-year medical student,
Ambika Maha, r wasn't attacked with acid

1362
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:12,480
because she was in a relationship

1363
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:15,600
with the tourism minister,
Mukul Sawant's daughter, Siddhi Sawant.

1364
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:18,320
It happened because
she dared to challenge her

1365
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:20,520
for the GS position in college elections.

1366
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:22,680
And not because she belongs
to a scheduled caste

1367
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:25,480
but because she wanted to be equal.

1368
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:28,160
Ambika wanted to work
for the college students.

1369
01:26:28,280 --> 01:26:29,600
She wanted to be their voice.

1370
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:32,080
She wanted to be a part
of a free and fair election.

1371
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:33,200
That was her fault.

1372
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:35,560
If this happened two months ago,

1373
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:37,480
then why file an FIR now?

1374
01:26:37,680 --> 01:26:39,400
Whenever any victim comes forward,

1375
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:42,320
you don't waste time asking this question.

1376
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:44,360
It takes time to find courage.

1377
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:46,880
And now that we've found
the courage, stand with us.

1378
01:26:47,560 --> 01:26:48,840
We've filed an FIR.

1379
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:51,880
We hope Goa Police
will soon take action.

1380
01:26:52,120 --> 01:26:54,400
Do you think you will get justice?

1381
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:55,720
I will.

1382
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:57,560
And I will keep fighting until I do.

1383
01:27:02,040 --> 01:27:03,040
All this food?

1384
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:04,896
- You've made it all?
- Guys, one sec.

1385
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:05,920
Of course.

1386
01:27:06,520 --> 01:27:07,880
It's not my birthday.

1387
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,080
That's why this food is not for you…
Please.

1388
01:27:10,160 --> 01:27:11,560
It's not Gayu's birthday either.

1389
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:12,880
But this food is for her.

1390
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:14,536
Guys, your food's already
packed downstairs.

1391
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:15,680
Please, get up.
Get out.

1392
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:17,280
But I want to sit here and eat.

1393
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:18,736
- No, just go.
- Okay, fine. We're leaving.

1394
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:20,496
- At least tell me what the occasion is.
- Occasion?

1395
01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:22,000
- Are you getting married?
- Married?!

1396
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:25,360
What is wrong with you guys?

1397
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:27,680
I've submitted my papers.

1398
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:29,640
I got a job at NeoPharma.

1399
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:31,480
I'm joining NeoPharma in two months.

1400
01:27:31,560 --> 01:27:33,000
Job!

1401
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:35,480
Now get out.

1402
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:36,576
- One second, if you
- Come on.

1403
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:38,200
Clean up your act,
then what about me?

1404
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:39,600
What about us?

1405
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:42,056
Someone will help you clean up
your act as well, guys. Now, get out.

1406
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:43,480
- No chance.
- Get out.

1407
01:27:43,640 --> 01:27:45,160
They are kids.
They made a mistake.

1408
01:27:45,640 --> 01:27:48,000
I am handling this.
It's all in my control.

1409
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:50,920
Tell Datta sir I am coming.

1410
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:52,360
I'll come to Nagpur personally.

1411
01:27:52,440 --> 01:27:53,440
Day after tomorrow.

1412
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:56,280
Yes, I will fix everything.

1413
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:58,480
Okay, see you.

1414
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:05,400
Bhau.

1415
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:07,880
I will deal with that girl.

1416
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:09,160
Shut up.

1417
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:13,760
- I had promised my mother, Bhau.
- Yes?

1418
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:16,240
Don't ask me to quit, Bhau.

1419
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:18,200
Where is Siddhi?

1420
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:19,960
Bhau… leave me.

1421
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:21,040
Where is Siddhi?

1422
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:24,720
Ambika!

1423
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:26,600
Ambika, come out.

1424
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:28,280
Ambika!

1425
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:30,520
Siddhi, get out.

1426
01:28:31,160 --> 01:28:32,520
Things will only get worse. Leave.

1427
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:34,400
I am not talking to you.

1428
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:36,800
Ambika!

1429
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,320
I had nothing to do
with what Bosco did.

1430
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:42,840
Only you know what I've been
through to come to this point.

1431
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:46,000
I won't let it be destroyed so easily.

1432
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:49,480
I want my name off that FIR, Ambika.

1433
01:28:50,840 --> 01:28:53,680
- My name shouldn't be on it.
- What is she high on?

1434
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:54,760
Throw her out.

1435
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:56,120
We've had enough of her.

1436
01:28:56,360 --> 01:28:58,120
We won't take this anymore.

1437
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:00,840
- Siddhi, let's go.
- And if that doesn't happen,

1438
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:02,720
then Bosco will pay you another visit.

1439
01:29:03,080 --> 01:29:04,680
And this time I will send him.

1440
01:29:04,760 --> 01:29:05,680
Let's go.

1441
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:07,096
- Siddhi, let's go.
- Did you hear me?!

1442
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:08,680
I will send him.

1443
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:17,560
Sorry.

1444
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:19,840
Hey…

1445
01:29:22,720 --> 01:29:23,760
I made it all for you,

1446
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:25,960
but I ate it.

1447
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:27,800
There you go.

1448
01:29:28,440 --> 01:29:29,440
No.

1449
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:35,880
You know…

1450
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:38,120
If I ever…

1451
01:29:39,880 --> 01:29:42,440
feature on top of
your priority list,

1452
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:48,560
I will definitely cook all this… again.

1453
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:50,440
I promise.

1454
01:29:51,320 --> 01:29:52,200
Zee, I am sorry.

1455
01:29:52,280 --> 01:29:55,880
- Ambika…
- I know. I know. It's okay.

1456
01:29:56,880 --> 01:29:58,000
You are here now.

1457
01:29:59,240 --> 01:30:00,400
That's all that matters.

1458
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:06,400
Congratulations on the job.

1459
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:08,520
Rish told me.

1460
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:14,760
You took my advice seriously.

1461
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:17,680
So that you take me seriously as well.

1462
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:24,360
- Is business slow?
- No.

1463
01:30:26,640 --> 01:30:29,200
I had the shack closed down today.

1464
01:30:30,280 --> 01:30:31,360
For us.

1465
01:30:38,440 --> 01:30:39,920
Zee, I…

1466
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,000
Listen…

1467
01:30:45,480 --> 01:30:46,920
When you feel it coming from within,

1468
01:30:49,200 --> 01:30:50,200
then you can say it.

1469
01:30:54,280 --> 01:30:55,280
Okay?

1470
01:30:56,720 --> 01:30:59,120
Maybe someday I will…

1471
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:04,160
Definitely.

1472
01:31:09,680 --> 01:31:10,960
<i>I am very proud of you, Ambika.</i>

1473
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:16,960
I've filed an FIR
in front of the media.

1474
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:19,520
Proud and all is okay.

1475
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:21,520
Just don't get angry.

1476
01:31:22,360 --> 01:31:27,360
I promised Gayatri, no more violence.

1477
01:31:28,840 --> 01:31:31,560
I am just happy that
you are here, and safe…

1478
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:34,280
and taking a stand.

1479
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:36,160
Thank you.

1480
01:31:38,240 --> 01:31:40,560
And anyway, this is
my final year at St. Martin's.

1481
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:43,560
Yeah, right.

1482
01:31:44,360 --> 01:31:45,560
- We believe you.
- Excuse me.

1483
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:47,560
- It's nothing.
- It's true.

1484
01:31:47,680 --> 01:31:49,520
- Yeah.
- Finally, my final year.

1485
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:50,520
Yeah.

1486
01:31:50,600 --> 01:31:52,200
And as a send-off gift,

1487
01:31:52,280 --> 01:31:55,920
I am going to organize
the most extravagant fest to date.

1488
01:31:56,560 --> 01:31:58,840
For that, I need all of your help.

1489
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:00,120
- Done
- Yeah.

1490
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:01,520
Of course.

1491
01:32:02,680 --> 01:32:04,240
Ambika? Got some news for you.

1492
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,480
- What?
- Management has decided,

1493
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:08,360
that till the police
investigation is ongoing,

1494
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:10,680
Siddhi will be removed
from the post of GS.

1495
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:15,320
Management has taken another decision.

1496
01:32:15,640 --> 01:32:17,520
They have given the fest
mandate to the juniors.

1497
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:20,536
This time the cultural fest
won't be organized by the seniors,

1498
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:21,560
but by the juniors.

1499
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:23,520
Who is leading the fest?

1500
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:25,560
Yuvraj.

1501
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:53,800
A new time, a new team!

1502
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:58,000
A new time, a new team!

1503
01:33:29,880 --> 01:33:31,400
Whenever something good
happens to me,

1504
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:33,440
you're the first person I think about.

1505
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:35,160
I really missed you, Rish.

1506
01:33:36,280 --> 01:33:38,880
Much more than I thought I would.

1507
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:42,960
Losing somebody you love…

1508
01:34:43,880 --> 01:34:45,440
That's what scares me the most.

1509
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:49,560
Rish, I…

1510
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:50,840
Don't.

1511
01:34:51,200 --> 01:34:52,240
Don't say anything.

1512
01:34:53,880 --> 01:34:56,440
Don't make any promises
you can't keep.

1513
01:35:00,040 --> 01:35:01,560
I really like you, Rishika.

1514
01:35:04,240 --> 01:35:05,240
But…

1515
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:07,400
you also feel it's better

1516
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:09,320
if we don't meet.

1517
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:13,800
It's not that simple.

1518
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:16,040
Nothing ever is.

1519
01:35:18,360 --> 01:35:20,840
Nothing is simple
because we are complicated.

1520
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:25,240
Your fear of attachment is as bad

1521
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,080
as my fear of disconnection.

1522
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:30,840
Fine.

1523
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:35,040
Someday, you will disappear,

1524
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:37,600
but I will make sure

1525
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:41,200
I disappear before you do.

1526
01:35:43,160 --> 01:35:44,520
- Rishika.
- Yuva.

1527
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:50,720
You make me really really happy.

1528
01:35:52,360 --> 01:35:55,280
So happy that it scares me.

1529
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:11,680
Silence, please.

1530
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:14,120
Silence!

1531
01:36:14,440 --> 01:36:16,200
- Silence, please.
- Not fair, sir! Not fair!

1532
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:19,160
Quiet.

1533
01:36:19,800 --> 01:36:20,800
Quiet!

1534
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:25,600
Sorry about that.

1535
01:36:26,680 --> 01:36:28,240
It's been the tradition
of this college.

1536
01:36:28,640 --> 01:36:29,760
It's a rite of passage.

1537
01:36:30,040 --> 01:36:31,536
They managed to scrounge
some sponsors and a band,

1538
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:33,760
and you give the entire
festival mandate to kids.

1539
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:36,000
What is the point?

1540
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:38,256
What is the point of organizing
fests for all these years?

1541
01:36:38,280 --> 01:36:40,200
It's not about sponsors.

1542
01:36:40,280 --> 01:36:41,576
Then what is it, Satish?
What is the point?

1543
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:43,440
Zee…
Students, look,

1544
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:45,840
you've been organizing
it all these years, right?

1545
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,160
It's time to give somebody
else the opportunity.

1546
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:50,496
And this year we're having
the international conclave.

1547
01:36:50,520 --> 01:36:52,320
I assure you the seniors will be

1548
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:54,600
wholly and solely responsible
for the organization...

1549
01:36:54,680 --> 01:36:56,040
Sir, one second.

1550
01:36:56,720 --> 01:36:58,440
We came here for the fest mandate,

1551
01:36:59,040 --> 01:37:00,440
not for some consolation prize.

1552
01:37:02,640 --> 01:37:04,440
Anyway, you've made your decision.

1553
01:37:05,480 --> 01:37:06,520
Then you should know mine.

1554
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:09,680
Medical, Arts, Commerce, Science.

1555
01:37:10,480 --> 01:37:13,560
No seniors from these departments
will attend the fest.

1556
01:37:13,640 --> 01:37:15,000
We're vetoing the fest.

1557
01:37:16,040 --> 01:37:17,400
And what will you gain out of it?

1558
01:37:18,920 --> 01:37:20,640
It will only ruin
the college's reputation.

1559
01:37:22,440 --> 01:37:23,840
Sir, we're only vetoing the fest.

1560
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:25,480
Not causing riots.

1561
01:37:26,280 --> 01:37:29,280
No harm will come
to your fest prep or your college.

1562
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:30,520
That's my responsibility.

1563
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:32,520
It's a promise.

1564
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:36,280
Come on.

1565
01:37:37,200 --> 01:37:40,280
<i>We have won against the seniors
and against Zee's gang.</i>

1566
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:43,320
<i>It should look like we won!</i>

1567
01:37:46,280 --> 01:37:47,280
Lift me up.

1568
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:06,480
Yes.

1569
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:07,680
You're vetoing the fest?

1570
01:38:08,440 --> 01:38:10,920
Go ahead, but why are you
involving the other seniors?

1571
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:12,760
I've spoken to the management.

1572
01:38:12,840 --> 01:38:14,760
You missed the show.
Everything has been decided.

1573
01:38:23,120 --> 01:38:24,480
What is your problem?

1574
01:38:24,760 --> 01:38:27,560
Why don't you think before
making a decision?

1575
01:38:27,640 --> 01:38:29,480
What is your problem?

1576
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:31,760
Everything I do or say is wrong.

1577
01:38:31,880 --> 01:38:33,440
Have you ever taken a stand for me?

1578
01:38:33,720 --> 01:38:35,080
First, do something right in life,

1579
01:38:35,240 --> 01:38:36,320
then ask for my support.

1580
01:38:36,680 --> 01:38:38,960
<i>Why are you using the fest
for your personal revenge?</i>

1581
01:38:43,640 --> 01:38:44,816
<i>- Listen to me.</i>
- Guys, stop this!

1582
01:38:44,840 --> 01:38:45,960
<i>Stop with all this drama</i>

1583
01:38:46,160 --> 01:38:48,840
<i>and talk to the principal.
Be a part of the fest</i>

1584
01:38:49,640 --> 01:38:51,400
You called to lecture me.

1585
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:52,960
Are you done?
Bye.

1586
01:39:20,280 --> 01:39:21,280
Were you with Yuva?

1587
01:39:25,960 --> 01:39:27,080
Couldn't find anyone better?

1588
01:39:28,240 --> 01:39:29,440
None like him.

1589
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:33,520
Feeling jealous?

1590
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:37,400
Your hormones are making you so blind.

1591
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:40,720
You can't see that he's using you.

1592
01:39:41,680 --> 01:39:42,680
Screw you, Zee…

1593
01:39:46,920 --> 01:39:48,520
Fine, Rish. Do what you want.

1594
01:39:48,880 --> 01:39:50,280
I know Yuva better than you.

1595
01:39:50,680 --> 01:39:52,000
It's all a game for him.

1596
01:39:52,640 --> 01:39:54,600
He will use you to mess with me,

1597
01:39:54,720 --> 01:39:55,880
and he said it himself.

1598
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,840
Why does everything have
to be about you?

1599
01:40:01,640 --> 01:40:03,360
You were my brother's friend.

1600
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:05,560
Don't try to be my brother.

1601
01:40:09,720 --> 01:40:10,720
Rish.

1602
01:40:11,320 --> 01:40:12,320
Rish!

1603
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:38,400
No, Gayatri.
I am sorry I cannot allow it.

1604
01:40:38,720 --> 01:40:40,480
Your committee cannot enter the fest.

1605
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:41,760
Please, leave.

1606
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:43,840
Sir, you're allowing a student

1607
01:40:44,120 --> 01:40:46,000
who's been accused of an acid attack.

1608
01:40:46,440 --> 01:40:48,880
And the victim
of that incident is not allowed.

1609
01:40:49,400 --> 01:40:50,400
How is that fair, sir?

1610
01:40:50,640 --> 01:40:51,640
What fair?

1611
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:54,480
I lost my GS post because
of your baseless allegations.

1612
01:40:54,840 --> 01:40:56,320
Now you have a problem with my entry.

1613
01:40:56,600 --> 01:40:58,320
I am the daughter of
this college's trustee.

1614
01:40:58,480 --> 01:41:00,680
Wow.
What a big achievement, Siddhi!

1615
01:41:01,120 --> 01:41:03,320
Why don't you tell
your trustee father to adopt us?

1616
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:05,640
I didn't come here to shout slogans

1617
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:07,800
and provoke students like them.

1618
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:10,120
Sir, the other students must know

1619
01:41:10,240 --> 01:41:11,880
what happened with Ambika.

1620
01:41:12,160 --> 01:41:13,040
And not just students,

1621
01:41:13,120 --> 01:41:14,456
but also the media,
Twitter, and all other platforms.

1622
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:16,776
Only then will Ambika get justice.
And that's why we are here.

1623
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:19,000
She is abusing the college fest
for personal propaganda.

1624
01:41:19,080 --> 01:41:20,080
Enough!

1625
01:41:21,120 --> 01:41:22,440
You both are barred from entering

1626
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:24,200
until this matter is solved.

1627
01:41:24,320 --> 01:41:26,200
- Why, sir?
- But, sir, she is the accused.

1628
01:41:26,280 --> 01:41:28,280
- What are you saying, sir?
- This is unfair.

1629
01:41:28,720 --> 01:41:30,480
This always happens.

1630
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:31,880
What happened to your rage now?

1631
01:41:31,960 --> 01:41:35,200
Make a list with Gayatri,

1632
01:41:35,320 --> 01:41:37,600
and let me know
when I should get angry.

1633
01:41:38,120 --> 01:41:39,616
It will make your life easier as well.

1634
01:41:39,640 --> 01:41:41,536
- Sir, you have to help us.
- Sir, this is unfair.

1635
01:41:41,560 --> 01:41:43,400
This is Gayatri's fault.

1636
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:45,520
Gayatri only wants to promote "Awaaz."

1637
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:47,080
- Yeah, because…
- Hold on.

1638
01:41:47,440 --> 01:41:48,440
Can I speak?

1639
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:52,000
You want to reach out
to other college students, right?

1640
01:41:53,160 --> 01:41:54,896
And you want that they
do not enter the campus?

1641
01:41:54,920 --> 01:41:55,960
- Is that right?
- Yes.

1642
01:41:56,440 --> 01:41:59,136
On day three, many events of the fest
will be held at the drive-in theatre.

1643
01:41:59,160 --> 01:42:00,176
There will be students out there as well.

1644
01:42:00,200 --> 01:42:02,000
You can go talk to them.

1645
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:03,640
Okay?

1646
01:42:03,720 --> 01:42:04,840
Sorted?
Is it sorted now?

1647
01:42:04,920 --> 01:42:06,080
Don't make a scene here.

1648
01:42:06,640 --> 01:42:07,816
Freshers are organizing
this for the first time.

1649
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:08,840
Let them do it properly.

1650
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:10,840
Tell them to leave.

1651
01:42:11,120 --> 01:42:12,240
You too, madam.

1652
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:14,136
Come on, we've got work to do.

1653
01:42:14,160 --> 01:42:15,240
It's sorted now. Let's go.

1654
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:50,280
Two cameras at the back.

1655
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,240
Check properly.
Keep those lights on the back.

1656
01:44:00,640 --> 01:44:03,080
Yeah, now you're getting into
the spirit of things.

1657
01:44:04,280 --> 01:44:05,800
<i>- That's better.</i>
- I said, hey!

1658
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:08,920
So, put your hands up in the air.

1659
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:12,040
What happened?

1660
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:15,080
You haven't been talking
to me for a few days.

1661
01:44:18,320 --> 01:44:19,320
Hold on.

1662
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:20,600
Just tell me what happened.

1663
01:44:57,120 --> 01:44:58,000
Quickly. Move fast.

1664
01:44:58,080 --> 01:45:01,120
I don't want to miss this performance.
It's my favorite artist.

1665
01:45:02,880 --> 01:45:03,880
Bala?

1666
01:45:05,680 --> 01:45:07,160
Ladies and gentlemen…

1667
01:45:07,240 --> 01:45:09,040
I got this chain for you, right?

1668
01:45:09,320 --> 01:45:11,240
- So what?
- So…

1669
01:45:11,960 --> 01:45:13,000
I want it back.

1670
01:45:14,720 --> 01:45:16,960
You are drunk, Bala.
Let's talk tomorrow.

1671
01:45:17,480 --> 01:45:18,360
Listen…

1672
01:45:18,440 --> 01:45:20,080
- What are you doing?
- I have a question.

1673
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:23,320
Do you wear it while doing him?

1674
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:24,440
Ritu, let's go.

1675
01:45:24,520 --> 01:45:25,760
Why?
I am talking to her.

1676
01:45:26,120 --> 01:45:27,200
Don't talk nonsense.

1677
01:45:27,560 --> 01:45:29,160
I said we'll talk tomorrow.
Go away.

1678
01:45:29,240 --> 01:45:31,720
What does he have that I don't?

1679
01:45:32,640 --> 01:45:33,840
What was that with Bhama?

1680
01:45:34,080 --> 01:45:35,280
Why did you make her cry?

1681
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:37,240
You don't know. Don't interfere.

1682
01:45:37,840 --> 01:45:39,840
What position is she on your list?

1683
01:45:39,960 --> 01:45:41,480
Before or after me?

1684
01:45:42,760 --> 01:45:44,960
Zee said you are using me
to get back at him.

1685
01:45:47,240 --> 01:45:48,240
Is that true?

1686
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:51,000
Tell me it's all lies.

1687
01:45:52,160 --> 01:45:53,160
Say it.

1688
01:45:54,680 --> 01:45:55,680
Say it.

1689
01:45:57,160 --> 01:46:01,640
Look, I want this chain back right now.
You don't deserve it

1690
01:46:02,640 --> 01:46:03,640
Go away, Bala…

1691
01:46:03,680 --> 01:46:07,280
I want this chain back right now.

1692
01:46:07,680 --> 01:46:08,560
I want it now.

1693
01:46:08,640 --> 01:46:10,400
- Bala, please!
- Give me the chain.

1694
01:46:10,480 --> 01:46:12,496
- Give me the chain, Ritu.
- What are you doing? Stop it, Bala.

1695
01:46:12,520 --> 01:46:14,840
- Take the chain off.
- Bala, please, stop it.

1696
01:46:14,920 --> 01:46:16,560
Hey, let her go!

1697
01:46:16,640 --> 01:46:18,680
- Let her go!
- Bala, leave me!

1698
01:46:21,400 --> 01:46:22,640
- Bala, please!
- Hey!

1699
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:24,120
- Bala.
- Bala!

1700
01:46:24,200 --> 01:46:25,800
- Leave me!
- Bala!

1701
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:27,120
What are you doing?

1702
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:28,440
Leave me.

1703
01:46:28,520 --> 01:46:29,520
Leave it.

1704
01:46:30,040 --> 01:46:31,080
Are you okay?

1705
01:46:31,400 --> 01:46:33,120
Bro, what happened?
Have you lost your mind?

1706
01:46:36,840 --> 01:46:38,080
Have you lost your mind?

1707
01:46:38,280 --> 01:46:40,080
Is this the way to treat a girl?

1708
01:46:40,160 --> 01:46:41,160
Oh my, God.

1709
01:46:41,360 --> 01:46:42,840
She could have choked and died.

1710
01:46:44,120 --> 01:46:45,360
- Are you okay?
- Take him away.

1711
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:47,400
Relax.

1712
01:47:16,400 --> 01:47:17,400
Bala!

1713
01:47:18,720 --> 01:47:19,720
- Where is Bala?
- Bala.

1714
01:47:19,880 --> 01:47:20,880
Where is he?

1715
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:22,480
Where is Bala?

1716
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:23,760
- Bala.
- Where is Bala?

1717
01:47:23,880 --> 01:47:24,880
Where is Bala?

1718
01:47:25,200 --> 01:47:26,880
How dare you touch my girl, rascal!

1719
01:47:27,240 --> 01:47:28,720
I will kill you!

1720
01:47:30,120 --> 01:47:31,120
How dare you?

1721
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:32,320
I will not spare you.

1722
01:47:32,440 --> 01:47:34,280
- Get lost!
- Hey!

1723
01:47:36,160 --> 01:47:37,160
Why you…

1724
01:47:37,880 --> 01:47:38,880
Yuva!

1725
01:47:41,200 --> 01:47:42,480
Once more. Once more.

1726
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:52,680
If you touch my boy again,

1727
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:54,880
I will break your head open.

1728
01:47:55,480 --> 01:47:56,480
Understood!

1729
01:47:58,200 --> 01:47:59,200
Get lost.

1730
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:01,640
Get him out of here!

1731
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:02,760
Him as well.

1732
01:49:01,920 --> 01:49:05,200
Tell Bala to come down
and apologize to Ritu publicly.

1733
01:49:06,400 --> 01:49:07,560
That will solve everything.

1734
01:49:17,120 --> 01:49:18,120
No.

1735
01:49:19,880 --> 01:49:21,000
He won't come down.

1736
01:49:22,760 --> 01:49:23,760
What happened was wrong.

1737
01:49:24,360 --> 01:49:26,080
But there won't be any apologies.

1738
01:49:27,080 --> 01:49:30,440
Are you going to tell us what to do?

1739
01:49:32,280 --> 01:49:33,720
If you have the guts, come down!

1740
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:35,520
If you have the guts, you go up.

1741
01:49:35,600 --> 01:49:37,120
Hey!

1742
01:49:37,320 --> 01:49:38,360
Come down.

1743
01:49:41,600 --> 01:49:43,080
You know he is wrong,

1744
01:49:43,400 --> 01:49:45,040
but you won't let him apologize.

1745
01:49:47,080 --> 01:49:49,360
This is your chance to fix everything.

1746
01:49:50,360 --> 01:49:52,440
If you don't take it,

1747
01:49:53,760 --> 01:49:56,040
I will break him and everyone
standing with him.

1748
01:49:56,720 --> 01:49:57,720
Go ahead.

1749
01:50:00,120 --> 01:50:01,200
Start breaking.

1750
01:50:05,640 --> 01:50:07,840
The truth is even I want that.

1751
01:50:12,080 --> 01:50:14,200
Now even if Bala wants to apologize,

1752
01:50:15,160 --> 01:50:16,200
we won't let him.

1753
01:50:17,880 --> 01:50:19,680
Feel free to do what you want.

1754
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:32,000
I told you already,

1755
01:50:33,520 --> 01:50:34,640
whatever you start,

1756
01:50:35,600 --> 01:50:36,720
I will end it.

1757
01:50:37,520 --> 01:50:38,520
Remember this.

1758
01:50:39,400 --> 01:50:40,520
Whatever happens now,

1759
01:50:42,280 --> 01:50:43,400
will be your responsibility.

1760
01:51:55,960 --> 01:51:56,960
One second.

1761
01:51:58,880 --> 01:51:59,880
Bala.

1762
01:52:01,520 --> 01:52:02,920
You know you are wrong.

1763
01:52:04,960 --> 01:52:06,480
Listen, you can stop this.

1764
01:52:08,120 --> 01:52:09,280
This can get worse.

1765
01:52:10,280 --> 01:52:13,000
Come with me.
I will take you to Ritu and the seniors.

1766
01:52:13,080 --> 01:52:14,680
Nothing will happen. I promise.

1767
01:52:14,760 --> 01:52:16,080
Nothing will happen to you.

1768
01:52:20,240 --> 01:52:22,080
Look, if you don't do it now,

1769
01:52:22,600 --> 01:52:24,400
the seniors will stop at nothing.

1770
01:52:24,480 --> 01:52:26,520
They are just waiting
for the fest to end.

1771
01:52:26,600 --> 01:52:28,080
After the last act ends,

1772
01:52:28,160 --> 01:52:29,320
they will come here and...

1773
01:52:29,400 --> 01:52:30,400
And what?

1774
01:52:30,440 --> 01:52:31,440
We are not scared.

1775
01:52:31,520 --> 01:52:32,440
Let them come.

1776
01:52:32,520 --> 01:52:33,920
- We'll show them.
- Show them?

1777
01:52:34,040 --> 01:52:35,736
- This is not the way!
- Save your threats for someone else.

1778
01:52:35,760 --> 01:52:36,920
- Come, Bala.
- Come on.

1779
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:38,680
Threats?
Bala, you know what I'm saying.

1780
01:52:38,760 --> 01:52:40,000
Bala, just listen to me.

1781
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,080
- …and then is the dean's speech.
- Did you call him?

1782
01:53:11,240 --> 01:53:12,760
- Do you have the entire lineup?
- Yes.

1783
01:53:13,920 --> 01:53:15,320
Hurry up. Hurry up.

1784
01:53:16,520 --> 01:53:17,560
I am scared.

1785
01:53:17,840 --> 01:53:18,840
What for?

1786
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,800
Look I am telling you,
he will get more guys to beat me up.

1787
01:53:23,120 --> 01:53:24,640
And you guys
will be collateral damage.

1788
01:53:25,400 --> 01:53:26,880
He just wants an apology…

1789
01:53:27,120 --> 01:53:28,360
- I will apologize.
- Hey!

1790
01:53:29,120 --> 01:53:30,280
This is not your fault.

1791
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:32,560
This is between seniors and juniors.

1792
01:53:32,760 --> 01:53:35,200
If you are scared, go back to
the hostel and lock yourself up.

1793
01:53:35,280 --> 01:53:36,280
Take him away.

1794
01:53:36,360 --> 01:53:37,480
Bala, you leave from here.

1795
01:53:42,640 --> 01:53:43,720
As long as I am here,

1796
01:53:43,960 --> 01:53:45,240
no one can lay a finger on you.

1797
01:53:45,840 --> 01:53:46,840
Got it?

1798
01:53:48,960 --> 01:53:49,960
Go on.

1799
01:53:55,200 --> 01:53:56,440
Take care of that guy upstairs.

1800
01:54:08,520 --> 01:54:10,240
Move the spotlight to the left.

1801
01:54:10,360 --> 01:54:11,680
Tell him to move the spotlight.

1802
01:54:11,760 --> 01:54:13,160
Don't you get it?

1803
01:54:13,240 --> 01:54:14,920
He's telling you to move it to the left.

1804
01:54:15,200 --> 01:54:16,200
I said left…

1805
01:54:16,240 --> 01:54:17,400
Why are you stopping, Bala?

1806
01:54:17,680 --> 01:54:18,680
More left.

1807
01:54:18,880 --> 01:54:20,776
You are being stubborn.
You don't want him to say sorry.

1808
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:21,800
Exactly.

1809
01:54:23,760 --> 01:54:25,920
We both were there.
We saw what happened.

1810
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:27,440
It was Bala's fault.

1811
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:29,440
Yes.
But he still won't apologize.

1812
01:54:30,280 --> 01:54:31,280
Why?

1813
01:54:36,560 --> 01:54:38,040
You want this, don't you?

1814
01:54:39,520 --> 01:54:42,120
None of this matters to you.

1815
01:54:44,280 --> 01:54:45,880
You just want to fight him.

1816
01:54:46,600 --> 01:54:50,320
This Bala, this fest mandate…
all of this.

1817
01:54:50,760 --> 01:54:51,920
Just to get to Zee.

1818
01:54:52,240 --> 01:54:53,400
Yes, correct.
Hundred percent.

1819
01:54:58,440 --> 01:54:59,440
And this?

1820
01:55:00,160 --> 01:55:01,160
What we share.

1821
01:55:02,720 --> 01:55:03,720
What about this?

1822
01:55:07,480 --> 01:55:08,480
Zee was right.

1823
01:55:11,680 --> 01:55:14,840
Even us, just to get back at him.

1824
01:55:15,640 --> 01:55:17,040
Yes, it was.

1825
01:55:20,240 --> 01:55:22,080
It isn't anymore.
But that's a different story.

1826
01:55:22,160 --> 01:55:23,256
But there is no point in telling you

1827
01:55:23,280 --> 01:55:25,280
- because you've clearly made up your mind.
- Yuva…

1828
01:55:26,160 --> 01:55:27,376
Turn the light around, you dimwit.

1829
01:55:27,400 --> 01:55:28,400
Tell him.

1830
01:55:29,160 --> 01:55:30,400
Didn't you hear?
Move the light.

1831
01:55:30,920 --> 01:55:31,920
You are right, Rish.

1832
01:55:32,280 --> 01:55:33,280
I want this.

1833
01:55:33,520 --> 01:55:34,760
I've been waiting for this.

1834
01:55:35,160 --> 01:55:36,040
To be face-to-face with him.

1835
01:55:36,120 --> 01:55:37,680
- Give me a reason.
- Yuva, you…

1836
01:55:37,880 --> 01:55:39,640
So I can make him pay
for what he did.

1837
01:55:40,360 --> 01:55:42,040
Why are you waiting for an excuse?

1838
01:55:42,640 --> 01:55:44,680
If you've made up your mind,
then go fight.

1839
01:55:44,760 --> 01:55:46,800
- Don't you get it?
- Fight like stray dogs.

1840
01:55:47,640 --> 01:55:49,400
But don't involve everybody else.

1841
01:55:50,160 --> 01:55:51,720
Why are you instigating the others?

1842
01:55:51,840 --> 01:55:53,160
Stop lecturing me.
Get lost.

1843
01:55:53,640 --> 01:55:54,880
Buzz off, Yuva!
Buzz off!

1844
01:55:54,960 --> 01:55:56,400
Yuva, the program is about to start.

1845
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:00,000
Hit the lights!

1846
01:56:00,440 --> 01:56:01,736
All you had to do was manage the lights.

1847
01:56:01,760 --> 01:56:02,760
What are you doing?

1848
01:56:35,120 --> 01:56:36,680
Rish, I just got a text from Arjun.

1849
01:56:36,760 --> 01:56:38,040
All the seniors are coming here.

1850
01:56:38,320 --> 01:56:39,680
It's going to be something big.

1851
01:56:39,760 --> 01:56:40,880
Please, do something.

1852
01:56:41,560 --> 01:56:42,400
Where is Zee?

1853
01:56:42,480 --> 01:56:43,720
He's the one getting them here.

1854
01:56:53,040 --> 01:56:55,120
RIOTS

1855
01:56:55,320 --> 01:56:57,880
Congratulations and best wishes
to the winning team.

1856
01:56:58,280 --> 01:57:00,720
And thanks all for coming
to the festival.

1857
01:57:11,120 --> 01:57:13,240
Guys, the event will end in an hour.

1858
01:57:14,520 --> 01:57:15,640
When is your film coming up?

1859
01:57:15,760 --> 01:57:16,760
Soon.

1860
01:57:17,040 --> 01:57:18,480
Are you here to watch my film

1861
01:57:18,560 --> 01:57:20,160
or talk to these students?

1862
01:57:21,240 --> 01:57:22,240
Both.

1863
01:57:23,960 --> 01:57:24,960
Yes, Rishika.

1864
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,840
Bosco, Gayatri, and the other girl
are at the drive-in theatre.

1865
01:57:29,920 --> 01:57:31,296
But all the students are right here.

1866
01:57:31,320 --> 01:57:32,376
<i>Yuva and the freshies are here.</i>

1867
01:57:32,400 --> 01:57:34,520
<i>And Zee has come here
with his whole gang.</i>

1868
01:57:34,680 --> 01:57:35,680
Fine.

1869
01:57:36,040 --> 01:57:37,040
All okay?

1870
01:57:38,200 --> 01:57:39,240
Are you calling Zee?

1871
01:58:37,160 --> 01:58:38,920
- Spare no one!
- Come on!

1872
01:59:08,880 --> 01:59:10,240
- Come on!
- Zee!

1873
01:59:11,120 --> 01:59:12,120
Zee!

1874
01:59:12,480 --> 01:59:13,480
Zee!

1875
01:59:14,400 --> 01:59:15,480
He's getting away!

1876
01:59:17,040 --> 01:59:19,360
Let's go to the hostel.
Let's finish it today.

1877
01:59:28,040 --> 01:59:30,200
Zee, act like a senior.

1878
01:59:30,360 --> 01:59:31,680
Zee, listen to me.

1879
01:59:32,120 --> 01:59:32,960
Stop, Zee.

1880
01:59:33,120 --> 01:59:33,960
Zee!

1881
01:59:34,040 --> 01:59:35,080
Think about it, Zee.

1882
01:59:35,200 --> 01:59:36,640
- You can still stop this…
- Quiet!

1883
01:59:37,120 --> 01:59:38,536
I've been controlling all this time.

1884
01:59:38,560 --> 01:59:39,480
I was quiet.

1885
01:59:39,560 --> 01:59:41,080
- Only you can stop this, Zee.
- Move.

1886
01:59:44,080 --> 01:59:45,320
Listen, Zee. Please.

1887
01:59:45,720 --> 01:59:47,080
Zee, this has to stop.

1888
01:59:47,760 --> 01:59:49,680
Zee, this can only get worse.

1889
01:59:50,600 --> 01:59:51,600
Xavier!

1890
02:00:51,200 --> 02:00:52,200
Call Bala.

1891
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:13,120
He's not answering.

1892
02:01:22,480 --> 02:01:24,440
This is not any normal fight.

1893
02:01:24,560 --> 02:01:25,640
It's a riot!

1894
02:01:25,840 --> 02:01:27,640
Get off the grid, man. Okay?

1895
02:01:27,800 --> 02:01:29,176
- Come on.
- Go to the girl's hostel

1896
02:01:29,200 --> 02:01:31,600
and lock him in a room,
and do not open the door.

1897
02:01:32,080 --> 02:01:33,200
Get it.
Do not open the door.

1898
02:01:33,240 --> 02:01:34,080
Now, go! Quick!

1899
02:01:34,160 --> 02:01:35,520
Quick!
Go, just go!

1900
02:01:35,600 --> 02:01:36,920
- Go.
- Go, go!

1901
02:02:04,880 --> 02:02:05,880
Where is Bala?!

1902
02:02:06,840 --> 02:02:07,960
Where have y'all hidden him?

1903
02:02:08,520 --> 02:02:09,560
- Get out!
- Come on!

1904
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:11,000
Get out!

1905
02:02:12,440 --> 02:02:13,280
Where is he?!

1906
02:02:13,360 --> 02:02:15,480
- Look ahead!
- We'll not spare anyone today!

1907
02:02:15,560 --> 02:02:16,640
They'll be here somewhere!

1908
02:02:19,320 --> 02:02:20,320
Run! Run!

1909
02:02:27,800 --> 02:02:29,680
Hey, you…

1910
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:31,480
Get out of here!

1911
02:02:31,560 --> 02:02:32,600
Get out!

1912
02:02:41,320 --> 02:02:43,240
Get out!
Where are you hiding?

1913
02:02:44,480 --> 02:02:45,480
The hostel is empty.

1914
02:02:45,560 --> 02:02:46,856
He must have fled
to the drive-in theatre.

1915
02:02:46,880 --> 02:02:48,080
All his boys are over there.

1916
02:02:48,160 --> 02:02:49,320
We will bash them over there.

1917
02:02:53,400 --> 02:02:55,240
Doesn't matter how many boys he gets,

1918
02:02:56,200 --> 02:02:58,200
they will all get beaten up.

1919
02:02:59,720 --> 02:03:01,720
Doesn't matter where they hide,

1920
02:03:01,800 --> 02:03:03,160
they will all get beaten up today!

1921
02:03:04,640 --> 02:03:08,000
If anyone interferes
or tries to stop us…

1922
02:03:08,120 --> 02:03:10,280
- Today…
- They will all get beaten up!

1923
02:03:10,400 --> 02:03:12,160
Come on!

1924
02:03:23,480 --> 02:03:24,560
Stop! Stop! Stop!

1925
02:03:24,640 --> 02:03:26,360
Buddy, move.
Move!

1926
02:03:44,880 --> 02:03:45,880
Zee…

1927
02:03:47,320 --> 02:03:48,320
Zee…

1928
02:03:49,360 --> 02:03:50,600
Zee, I'm talking to you.

1929
02:03:52,240 --> 02:03:54,120
What are you doing, Zee?

1930
02:03:54,480 --> 02:03:55,320
Look at yourself.

1931
02:03:55,400 --> 02:03:56,960
Have you lost your mind?

1932
02:03:59,440 --> 02:04:00,440
Zee!

1933
02:04:02,320 --> 02:04:03,320
Zee, have you lost it?

1934
02:04:03,400 --> 02:04:04,600
Yes, I've lost it.

1935
02:04:06,960 --> 02:04:07,960
Zee.

1936
02:04:08,560 --> 02:04:10,360
Listen, I am telling you.

1937
02:04:10,920 --> 02:04:12,320
Just stop right now.

1938
02:04:12,760 --> 02:04:13,600
Don't do this.

1939
02:04:13,680 --> 02:04:14,896
This will change things permanently.

1940
02:04:14,920 --> 02:04:16,120
You are better than this, Zee.

1941
02:04:16,160 --> 02:04:17,160
You know it.

1942
02:04:29,240 --> 02:04:30,280
Zee…

1943
02:04:30,960 --> 02:04:32,640
Zee, I'm talking to you.

1944
02:04:32,720 --> 02:04:34,400
At least say something.

1945
02:04:34,840 --> 02:04:36,280
You told Yuva to stop, right?

1946
02:04:36,360 --> 02:04:37,360
Did he stop?

1947
02:04:37,480 --> 02:04:40,120
You and Yuva are different.

1948
02:04:41,240 --> 02:04:43,320
What Bala did with Ritu was wrong, right?

1949
02:04:43,400 --> 02:04:45,560
- Zee…
- If that was wrong,

1950
02:04:45,720 --> 02:04:47,400
then what I am going to do is right.

1951
02:05:27,040 --> 02:05:28,760
Why are we following these idiots?

1952
02:05:29,800 --> 02:05:31,000
To get embarrassed again?

1953
02:05:32,600 --> 02:05:34,640
Father said to stay away from them.

1954
02:05:36,120 --> 02:05:37,480
Why are we following them?

1955
02:05:40,120 --> 02:05:41,280
Are you deaf?!

1956
02:05:43,320 --> 02:05:44,360
What is your plan now?

1957
02:05:45,400 --> 02:05:46,760
Throw acid on Gayatri as well?

1958
02:05:48,160 --> 02:05:49,560
Throwing acid on her was a mistake.

1959
02:05:49,720 --> 02:05:51,240
Should have poured it down her throat.

1960
02:05:53,880 --> 02:05:55,640
My mistake was throwing acid on her.

1961
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:57,680
And your mistake was talking to her.

1962
02:05:59,320 --> 02:06:00,840
If anything happens to her,

1963
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:02,120
we'll be blamed for it.

1964
02:06:03,200 --> 02:06:04,240
Nothing will happen.

1965
02:06:04,320 --> 02:06:05,760
If anything happens, I'll handle it.

1966
02:06:08,280 --> 02:06:09,680
See, look at these idiots.

1967
02:06:11,920 --> 02:06:13,376
They are going to start
a riot at the college fest.

1968
02:06:13,400 --> 02:06:14,760
This is our best chance.

1969
02:06:16,400 --> 02:06:17,840
I can't be a part of this.

1970
02:06:18,080 --> 02:06:19,080
Hey!

1971
02:06:19,880 --> 02:06:21,760
Don't you want
to be a politician like Bhau?

1972
02:06:24,120 --> 02:06:25,240
Would Bhau have let her go?

1973
02:06:27,040 --> 02:06:28,440
If you want to be like him,

1974
02:06:29,720 --> 02:06:31,720
then you have to be
a part of all this. Got it?

1975
02:06:33,880 --> 02:06:35,040
Drive faster.

1976
02:07:03,560 --> 02:07:06,160
Awaaz will always
stand up against injustice.

1977
02:07:06,360 --> 02:07:08,040
I didn't come here to give a speech.

1978
02:07:08,320 --> 02:07:12,000
What happened with Ambika Mahar
can happen to any one of us.

1979
02:07:12,560 --> 02:07:14,640
If we are together we are one voice!

1980
02:07:15,120 --> 02:07:20,000
We all have to stand together
for justice at our rally next week.

1981
02:07:20,440 --> 02:07:22,240
This is my sincere request to all of you.

1982
02:07:22,560 --> 02:07:23,800
Help us!

1983
02:07:24,080 --> 02:07:25,560
Stand with Awaaz.

1984
02:07:25,920 --> 02:07:27,520
Ambika deserves justice.

1985
02:07:27,840 --> 02:07:30,640
Both national and international
media will cover this rally.

1986
02:07:31,760 --> 02:07:34,720
- Yuva!
- My fresher brothers and sisters.

1987
02:07:35,840 --> 02:07:37,920
I come here asking for your help.

1988
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:43,840
The respected seniors of St. Martin's

1989
02:07:44,040 --> 02:07:47,560
will soon be here in large numbers.

1990
02:07:48,640 --> 02:07:50,960
To make us pay for our mistakes.

1991
02:07:53,440 --> 02:07:56,480
- Yuva, don't provoke them…
- Are you going to watch quietly?

1992
02:07:56,560 --> 02:07:58,240
- No!
- Stop it!

1993
02:07:58,320 --> 02:08:00,800
- Will you support me?
- Yes!

1994
02:08:01,160 --> 02:08:03,560
- Will you fight with me?
- Yes!

1995
02:08:03,640 --> 02:08:05,920
- Will you stand with me?
- Yes!

1996
02:08:09,040 --> 02:08:11,760
- Will you support me?
- Yes!

1997
02:08:11,840 --> 02:08:12,720
Yuva, stop this!

1998
02:08:12,840 --> 02:08:14,880
- Will you fight with me?
- Yes!

1999
02:08:15,200 --> 02:08:17,040
Let's show them
the power of juniors.

2000
02:08:17,200 --> 02:08:18,480
Yes.

2001
02:08:36,040 --> 02:08:37,960
Come on!

2002
02:09:31,480 --> 02:09:33,520
Come! Come on!

2003
02:11:34,840 --> 02:11:35,840
Bosco.

2004
02:11:36,360 --> 02:11:38,120
I am going to fulfill your dream.

2005
02:11:43,560 --> 02:11:44,560
Where are they?

2006
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:46,000
Where are they?

2007
02:11:46,400 --> 02:11:47,440
Over there.

2008
02:11:51,640 --> 02:11:52,640
Hold him.

2009
02:11:58,240 --> 02:11:59,760
No. Ambika, run.

2010
02:11:59,880 --> 02:12:00,880
Leave me.

2011
02:12:01,240 --> 02:12:02,240
Leave!

2012
02:13:20,720 --> 02:13:21,720
Done?

2013
02:13:23,040 --> 02:13:24,080
Done with the anger?

2014
02:13:24,840 --> 02:13:25,840
Tell me.

2015
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:32,000
Hit me!

2016
02:13:32,240 --> 02:13:33,240
Hit me!

2017
02:13:38,080 --> 02:13:39,160
Why are you stopping?

2018
02:13:39,680 --> 02:13:40,680
Hit me!

2019
02:13:46,960 --> 02:13:48,920
End it all today.

2020
02:13:49,720 --> 02:13:50,720
Hit me!

2021
02:13:58,120 --> 02:14:00,240
This is what you wanted, right?

2022
02:14:01,120 --> 02:14:02,160
Hit me, Yuvi.

2023
02:14:15,320 --> 02:14:19,760
All that rage inside you,
bring it out.

2024
02:14:20,520 --> 02:14:21,520
Come on.

2025
02:14:22,160 --> 02:14:23,160
Come on!

2026
02:14:23,640 --> 02:14:25,560
All that you kept bottled inside you.

2027
02:14:25,640 --> 02:14:27,720
Take it all out. Come on.

2028
02:14:35,560 --> 02:14:36,560
Hit me!

2029
02:14:38,160 --> 02:14:39,280
Hit me, Yuva.

2030
02:14:43,320 --> 02:14:44,320
Zee!

2031
02:14:46,040 --> 02:14:47,280
Zee!

2032
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:55,760
Gayu!

2033
02:15:07,200 --> 02:15:08,280
Someone call the ambulance.

2034
02:15:08,320 --> 02:15:09,520
Oh my God, where did he go?

2035
02:15:10,120 --> 02:15:11,040
Here, here.

2036
02:15:11,120 --> 02:15:13,000
Tie this here, quick!

2037
02:15:13,640 --> 02:15:14,840
Call the ambulance!

2038
02:15:18,480 --> 02:15:20,120
Buddy, come here. Quick!

2039
02:15:20,440 --> 02:15:21,320
We need to get to the hospital!

2040
02:15:21,400 --> 02:15:22,400
Get the car!

2041
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:25,000
There!

2042
02:15:28,960 --> 02:15:29,960
Start the car!

2043
02:15:31,560 --> 02:15:33,120
Wait! Stop!

2044
02:15:35,560 --> 02:15:36,960
Enough! That's enough!

2045
02:15:37,440 --> 02:15:38,440
Enough!

2046
02:15:38,680 --> 02:15:40,040
That's enough!

2047
02:15:40,760 --> 02:15:41,760
Get the car!

2048
02:15:43,560 --> 02:15:44,960
Move.
Move.

2049
02:15:45,680 --> 02:15:46,680
Make way.

2050
02:19:52,080 --> 02:19:53,080
Hello.

2051
02:19:53,600 --> 02:19:55,120
Our scores are still not even.

2052
02:20:00,600 --> 02:20:02,840
- Long live…
- Awaaz!

2053
02:20:02,960 --> 02:20:05,240
- Long live…
- Awaaz!
