1
00:00:00,002 --> 00:00:01,243
Previously on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:02,936
- And you want my help.
- Yeah. I never thought this day

3
00:00:02,937 --> 00:00:04,350
would come either, but here we are.

4
00:00:04,356 --> 00:00:05,855
- Time to go, inmate.
- Where are you taking me?

5
00:00:05,966 --> 00:00:07,799
You're going back to level one.

6
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,384
- Where did you get this?
- Felicity.

7
00:00:10,461 --> 00:00:11,885
She's the one
who sent us to Star City.

8
00:00:11,962 --> 00:00:13,545
I'm so sorry to be the one
to tell you this,

9
00:00:13,622 --> 00:00:15,714
but Felicity Smoak is dead.

10
00:00:15,725 --> 00:00:18,633
Just making good
on an old promise.

11
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:22,763
Isn't that right, Anatoly?

12
00:00:32,224 --> 00:00:34,649
You, uh...

13
00:00:34,726 --> 00:00:37,652
You remember the last time
we saw each other?

14
00:00:37,729 --> 00:00:41,656
You killed my brothers, all of them.

15
00:00:41,733 --> 00:00:46,870
Let me, um...
let me jog your memory.

16
00:00:46,947 --> 00:00:48,797
You betrayed me...

17
00:00:53,578 --> 00:00:55,971
After I trusted you...

18
00:00:59,251 --> 00:01:01,051
I gave you my friendship.

19
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:05,355
Man like you has no friends.

20
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:09,193
Where are your friends now?

21
00:01:11,096 --> 00:01:13,480
Huh?

22
00:01:13,557 --> 00:01:17,067
Oliver Queen!

23
00:01:18,436 --> 00:01:20,278
No!

24
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:22,072
The arrow team...

25
00:01:24,985 --> 00:01:27,127
They're all gone, brother.

26
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:36,920
You picked the losing side.

27
00:01:36,997 --> 00:01:39,422
What are you waiting for?

28
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:41,433
Kill me!

29
00:01:44,721 --> 00:01:48,023
Not yet.
I got a little job for you.

30
00:01:49,593 --> 00:01:51,726
You're gonna help me

31
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:55,155
destroy Oliver Queen.

32
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:06,125

33
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:11,121
I thought that mind control
stuff only happened in movies.

34
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:13,748
It wasn't exactly mind control.

35
00:02:13,825 --> 00:02:16,626
This place seems like
it's gotten a lot worse.

36
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:18,753
They came in after
you stabbed that guard.

37
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,681
These guys are professional jerks.

38
00:02:20,757 --> 00:02:24,342
Less yard time,
cell checks every half-hour.

39
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:25,969
Have they been rough on you?

40
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:28,522
Me?
No way.

41
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:30,765
I'm glad they're here.

42
00:02:30,842 --> 00:02:33,143
Brick's been pissed ever since
you shut down his fight club,

43
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,978
and I'm the only one
he can take it out on.

44
00:02:35,055 --> 00:02:37,981
If they weren't here,
he'd have come after me.

45
00:02:38,058 --> 00:02:41,535
You totally saved me.
Typical Green Arrow move.

46
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:51,828
Pick it up.

47
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:54,998
I thought Dunbar was
on Brick's payroll.

48
00:02:55,075 --> 00:02:58,001
Not anymore.
Ever since that fight club fiasco,

49
00:02:58,078 --> 00:02:59,377
Dunbar's got a slap
on the wrist.

50
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:02,881
Now he treats Brick like, well, you.

51
00:03:02,892 --> 00:03:04,799
On your feet, 4587.

52
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:07,010
- Speaking of.
- Time to go.

53
00:03:07,087 --> 00:03:09,012
Have my meal privileges been revoked?

54
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:12,641
I said, let's go, inmate.

55
00:03:12,717 --> 00:03:15,727
- Err.
- I'm not telling you again.

56
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:22,359
That's what I thought.

57
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:23,693
You have a visitor.

58
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,078
I thought I didn't have any visitation.

59
00:03:25,155 --> 00:03:26,580
Well, it must be your lucky day.

60
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:44,923
What do you want?

61
00:03:44,934 --> 00:03:46,600
Try sounding a little
bit more grateful, Ollie.

62
00:03:46,677 --> 00:03:48,426
I had to file an emergency motion

63
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:50,053
just to get in here to see you,

64
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,980
and it's a good thing
that I did because you

65
00:03:52,057 --> 00:03:53,848
look like crap.

66
00:03:53,925 --> 00:03:55,609
Just need to document...

67
00:03:55,686 --> 00:03:58,103
- Hey.
- Your injuries really fast.

68
00:03:58,179 --> 00:04:00,188
What are you doing?

69
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:02,065
We got the Level Two psych records

70
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:04,234
from wherever or whoever you had
sneak them out of Slabside.

71
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:05,860
How did you do that, by the way?
No, no.

72
00:04:05,937 --> 00:04:07,362
Never mind.
Don't tell me.

73
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,030
It's better for your case
if I don't know.

74
00:04:09,107 --> 00:04:10,615
What do you mean, my case?

75
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:12,534
- Your case.
- What... what are you working

76
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:14,286
with Jean loring?

77
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:18,623
No. I'm working with your wife.

78
00:04:18,634 --> 00:04:22,877
Felicity would have told me
if she was working with you,

79
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:26,089
and the only reason that
you would ever help me

80
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:30,552
or anyone is if there was
something in it for you.

81
00:04:30,628 --> 00:04:32,595
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

82
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:36,224
You're the reason that Diaz
got away in the first place.

83
00:04:36,301 --> 00:04:38,810
Do you remember?

84
00:04:38,821 --> 00:04:42,105
You know, the Ollie I knew,

85
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:47,277
he had a hard time taking
responsibility for his failures, too.

86
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:49,621
You know what's amazing?

87
00:04:51,908 --> 00:04:54,909
You're nothing like her.

88
00:04:54,986 --> 00:04:59,122
So go ahead and pretend to be Laurel,

89
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,958
my Laurel, for as long as you want.

90
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:06,680
You never will be, ever.

91
00:05:06,757 --> 00:05:09,141
Stay away from my wife.

92
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,865
I can't believe she's dead.

93
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:28,452
Here.

94
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:32,247
I don't really drink.

95
00:05:32,324 --> 00:05:34,082
Well, I do.

96
00:05:36,027 --> 00:05:38,328
So what happened?

97
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:39,954
How did she die?

98
00:05:40,031 --> 00:05:41,715
It was a couple weeks ago,

99
00:05:41,792 --> 00:05:43,216
give or take.

100
00:05:43,293 --> 00:05:45,168
She was murdered.

101
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:47,295
Murdered?

102
00:05:47,372 --> 00:05:49,214
Who would hurt Felicity?

103
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:50,507
Roy, the Felicity you knew
was very different

104
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,559
than what she became.

105
00:05:52,636 --> 00:05:54,552
We wanted her to join us,

106
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:56,012
but she cut ties.

107
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:57,680
Instead, she went underground.

108
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,900
She started calling
herself the calculator.

109
00:05:59,976 --> 00:06:01,184
- Like her father?
- She ran in some

110
00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:02,519
dangerous circles.

111
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:04,062
You walk that path long enough,

112
00:06:04,073 --> 00:06:05,781
sooner or later,
it catches up to you.

113
00:06:07,434 --> 00:06:10,193
I'm sorry, William.

114
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:12,987
However Felicity died,

115
00:06:13,064 --> 00:06:15,990
whatever the circumstances,

116
00:06:16,067 --> 00:06:18,752
she still sent me this signal,

117
00:06:18,829 --> 00:06:20,370
and I need to know why.

118
00:06:20,447 --> 00:06:23,373
You don't owe her anything, William.

119
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,759
Yeah?
Well, maybe she owed me.

120
00:06:27,287 --> 00:06:29,003
Ok. I noticed this earlier.

121
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,005
You see the color variation?

122
00:06:31,082 --> 00:06:33,091
I think Felicity was
trying to lead us there.

123
00:06:33,102 --> 00:06:36,428
This is kind of crazy.
You know that, right?

124
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:38,513
All I know is
I've come this far.

125
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:40,482
I'm not stopping now.

126
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:53,903
Has the Silencer's flight
touched down from Moscow yet?

127
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,947
An hour ago in Star City
just like we thought.

128
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:58,032
My facial recognition algorithm
indicates she hasn't had a rendezvous

129
00:06:58,109 --> 00:07:00,794
yet with Diaz,
but I did get an update

130
00:07:00,871 --> 00:07:02,954
on why Diaz sent
the Silencer to Russia.

131
00:07:02,965 --> 00:07:04,214
Anatoly Knyazev?

132
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:06,040
I can't get specific confirmation,

133
00:07:06,117 --> 00:07:07,417
but the rumor on the dark web is

134
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:09,252
that the entire bratva
was massacred

135
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:10,804
two nights ago in Moscow,

136
00:07:10,881 --> 00:07:13,265
which doesn't bode well
for our frenemy Anatoly.

137
00:07:15,627 --> 00:07:17,635
How'd things go with Oliver?
Is he ok?

138
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:19,762
He's fine. He hates me,
he thinks I'm a monster,

139
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:22,307
and he doesn't want my
help, but he's fine.

140
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:25,268
Oh. Ok. Listen. I mean, prison's
obviously been rough on Oliver.

141
00:07:25,345 --> 00:07:27,061
I mean, that's the whole
point of prison. Duh!

142
00:07:27,138 --> 00:07:29,156
But he doesn't know the new you.

143
00:07:29,232 --> 00:07:33,443
I mean, he just knows the old,
scarier, murdery version of you.

144
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,445
I don't really care
what Oliver thinks of me,

145
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:37,447
but he doesn't want me
representing him,

146
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:40,167
and I don't know how quickly you're
gonna find substitute counsel.

147
00:07:40,243 --> 00:07:42,076
No way. We are not changing
our strategy, not now.

148
00:07:42,153 --> 00:07:44,454
Oliver's constitutional
rights were violated.

149
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:46,456
A prosecutor stepping over to the
opposite side of the line to defend him

150
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:48,249
is the best leverage
that we have.

151
00:07:50,453 --> 00:07:52,086
I just got a hit.

152
00:07:52,163 --> 00:07:53,963
Diaz and the 3 Longbow Hunters were spotted

153
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,840
outside a munitions plant
in orchid bay.

154
00:07:55,917 --> 00:07:59,093
He's probably looking
for some kind of weapon.

155
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:01,855
Too bad he's not gonna live
long enough to get it.

156
00:08:01,932 --> 00:08:04,399
We have to move before
they change locations.

157
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:11,865
Why do bad guys always
pick the creepiest places?

158
00:08:11,942 --> 00:08:13,691
Oh, wait.
Was that a serious question?

159
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:15,318
Well, I mean, you used to be a bad guy...
well, gal,

160
00:08:15,395 --> 00:08:16,986
so I figured you'd know.

161
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:20,073
This doesn't look like
official D.A. business.

162
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,866
Did we have to invite him?

163
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:24,377
- Are you two, like, friends now?
- It's a long story,

164
00:08:24,454 --> 00:08:27,121
but the punch line is that the
Silencer and Diaz are inside,

165
00:08:27,198 --> 00:08:29,207
which means we're finally gonna
get a chance to bring them down.

166
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:31,459
And you know this how?
Oh, wait.

167
00:08:31,536 --> 00:08:32,961
Let me guess.
Long story.

168
00:08:33,037 --> 00:08:35,505
Can we just leave it at that?

169
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:38,266
- So are you in?
- You really got to ask?

170
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:42,896
Where the hell is she?

171
00:08:42,973 --> 00:08:44,639
According to my tracker,

172
00:08:44,716 --> 00:08:46,307
she's... she's in there.

173
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:15,837
- Bomb!
- Go, go, move, move,

174
00:09:15,913 --> 00:09:17,213
move, move, move!

175
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,785
A.R.G.U.S. has been
tracking Diaz ever since

176
00:09:34,861 --> 00:09:36,453
he slaughtered
the bratva in Russia.

177
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:39,352
The SCPD was responding to a
munitions plant break-in,

178
00:09:39,356 --> 00:09:41,156
so please tell me, Felicity,

179
00:09:41,233 --> 00:09:43,700
how the hell do you end up in
the middle of my op again?

180
00:09:43,711 --> 00:09:45,369
Why don't I just say
exponential search algorithm,

181
00:09:45,379 --> 00:09:47,329
and we'll just leave it at that?

182
00:09:47,406 --> 00:09:49,539
We planted a tracker
on the Silencer's belt.

183
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,416
Obviously, Diaz must have found it

184
00:09:51,493 --> 00:09:53,635
and is using it as bait against us.

185
00:09:53,712 --> 00:09:57,381
How did you manage that? You were
nowhere near the Silencer at the CDC.

186
00:09:57,391 --> 00:09:59,466
That thing at the CDC was you guys?

187
00:09:59,543 --> 00:10:02,886
Uh, Felicity wasn't near her.
I was.

188
00:10:02,897 --> 00:10:04,721
We snuck her out together.

189
00:10:04,732 --> 00:10:06,139
So you two captured the Silencer?

190
00:10:06,216 --> 00:10:08,025
But Felicity and Laurel were the ones

191
00:10:08,102 --> 00:10:10,143
that tortured her.

192
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,229
Actually, I convinced her not to.
You're welcome.

193
00:10:12,239 --> 00:10:14,031
So now you're working with Laurel?

194
00:10:14,108 --> 00:10:15,732
- I'm standing right here.
- To be fair, she did help

195
00:10:15,743 --> 00:10:17,692
shut down that illegal
psychiatric program at Slabside.

196
00:10:17,703 --> 00:10:19,486
Wait. Hold on a sec.
You're gonna give me

197
00:10:19,563 --> 00:10:21,580
crap about working with
the new Green Arrow,

198
00:10:21,657 --> 00:10:23,865
and meanwhile, you're siding
with the black frickin' siren?

199
00:10:23,942 --> 00:10:25,200
Again, still here.

200
00:10:25,277 --> 00:10:27,160
You're working with
the new Green Arrow?

201
00:10:27,237 --> 00:10:29,371
Guys, I think
that the whole point of this

202
00:10:29,448 --> 00:10:31,998
is that maybe we could all pick
up our phones a little more, huh,

203
00:10:32,075 --> 00:10:33,425
shoot a text.

204
00:10:33,502 --> 00:10:35,219
Yeah. I am totally
talking about the fact

205
00:10:35,295 --> 00:10:37,754
that everyone forgot
my birthday last week.

206
00:10:37,765 --> 00:10:39,256
Your party is next week.
Act surprised!

207
00:10:39,266 --> 00:10:41,100
Ok. Now that all of our
deep, dark secrets are out,

208
00:10:41,176 --> 00:10:43,427
do you think that we could switch
our focus back to the psycho

209
00:10:43,437 --> 00:10:45,345
who just tried to blow us up?

210
00:10:45,422 --> 00:10:46,847
Sounds like good idea.

211
00:10:46,923 --> 00:10:48,098
First, ground rules.

212
00:10:48,109 --> 00:10:49,724
No new Green Arrow.

213
00:10:49,735 --> 00:10:52,561
Secondly, no one who isn't from this earth.

214
00:10:52,637 --> 00:10:54,446
You're kicking me out?

215
00:10:54,523 --> 00:10:56,106
Well, you are the D.A.

216
00:10:56,117 --> 00:10:57,991
You could have been exposed tonight,

217
00:10:58,068 --> 00:10:59,693
and I think there's
no need to risk that again.

218
00:10:59,769 --> 00:11:02,946
So an international
mob boss gets to stay

219
00:11:03,023 --> 00:11:04,957
and I have to leave, is that it?

220
00:11:07,444 --> 00:11:09,286
Huh! Unbelievable.

221
00:11:09,296 --> 00:11:10,712
- Laurel, wait.
- Dasvidaniya.

222
00:11:10,789 --> 00:11:12,798
Laurel, please wait.

223
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:14,416
It looks like you and your husband
don't need my help after all.

224
00:11:14,493 --> 00:11:16,960
He does, we do, I do,
but, more importantly,

225
00:11:16,971 --> 00:11:18,795
I need the D.A. to help Oliver.

226
00:11:18,806 --> 00:11:21,640
Well, I was happy to help
your little charity case

227
00:11:21,717 --> 00:11:24,384
when I had some downtime, but now
that Diaz is back in, I don't.

228
00:11:24,461 --> 00:11:26,845
Laurel, Laurel, please!

229
00:11:26,856 --> 00:11:28,814
If I could trade places with you

230
00:11:28,891 --> 00:11:31,817
so that you could go get Diaz, I would,

231
00:11:31,894 --> 00:11:34,436
but this is my only chance
to get Oliver out of prison.

232
00:11:34,513 --> 00:11:36,613
This is it! This...

233
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,276
This is my only chance
to get my husband back.

234
00:11:41,353 --> 00:11:44,529
Laurel, please.

235
00:11:44,606 --> 00:11:47,666
You know, sometimes, I really
hate being your Laurel.

236
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:54,080
I promise you that when we
catch Diaz, I will call you

237
00:11:54,157 --> 00:11:56,458
and we will finish this
just like we planned.

238
00:11:56,535 --> 00:11:58,385
Fine.

239
00:12:01,373 --> 00:12:04,007
We're close. Should be
just up here.

240
00:12:04,018 --> 00:12:06,018
All these years, and you're
still that boy who hates

241
00:12:06,094 --> 00:12:07,853
not knowing stuff.

242
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:10,138
Are you still that girl who
loves getting into trouble?

243
00:12:10,215 --> 00:12:12,933
You know it.

244
00:12:13,009 --> 00:12:15,861
It's good seeing you.

245
00:12:15,938 --> 00:12:18,772
I tried to keep in touch
after everything.

246
00:12:18,848 --> 00:12:22,868
Yeah, I know.
Guess it was just easier

247
00:12:22,945 --> 00:12:25,195
for me to move on
than to hold on, you know?

248
00:12:25,206 --> 00:12:28,156
Wish I could do
the same sometimes.

249
00:12:28,233 --> 00:12:30,209
I cannot believe that
they're full-grown adults.

250
00:12:30,285 --> 00:12:32,619
Which means we're old.

251
00:12:32,696 --> 00:12:34,463
I never thought I'd
see you again.

252
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,882
This is the last place I ever
thought I'd come back to.

253
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,792
I wanted William
to leave me on Lian Yu.

254
00:12:38,868 --> 00:12:41,220
How did he convince you?

255
00:12:41,296 --> 00:12:44,631
I found a message
inside of Oliver's bow,

256
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,508
the Mark of four.

257
00:12:46,585 --> 00:12:48,718
That's impossible.
Who could've put it there?

258
00:12:48,729 --> 00:12:51,513
I don't know,
but I think it's best

259
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:53,348
that we keep this between us.

260
00:12:53,425 --> 00:12:54,900
None of us have seen
William for years.

261
00:12:54,977 --> 00:12:56,518
You sure we can trust him?

262
00:12:56,595 --> 00:12:58,237
He's Oliver's son.

263
00:12:58,313 --> 00:13:00,480
That is exactly what worries me.

264
00:13:00,557 --> 00:13:02,574
Hey. According
to the map, it's only

265
00:13:02,651 --> 00:13:04,451
a few hundred more
feet this way.

266
00:13:21,929 --> 00:13:24,170
- Let's go, inmate.
- What? Where?

267
00:13:24,247 --> 00:13:27,048
Oh, you're going
to the hole permanently.

268
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:28,308
Hey.
What's going on?

269
00:13:28,385 --> 00:13:30,260
Officer Dunbar was
killed last night,

270
00:13:30,271 --> 00:13:32,304
and this little bastard was
the last one seen with him.

271
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,930
What?! I didn't kill anybody.
It wasn't me!

272
00:13:34,007 --> 00:13:36,141
Wait. How do you know
it was him?

273
00:13:36,217 --> 00:13:37,726
Oliver, it wasn't me, I swear!

274
00:13:37,802 --> 00:13:40,562
It must have been Brick!
He set me up!

275
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,490
Oliver! Oliver!

276
00:13:45,027 --> 00:13:47,119
Look who just got out
of the loony bin.

277
00:13:47,195 --> 00:13:49,404
You learn any
life lessons in there?

278
00:13:49,481 --> 00:13:51,957
Maybe those doctors helped
get your head on straight.

279
00:13:52,034 --> 00:13:54,409
Tell me what you know
about Dunbar's murder.

280
00:13:54,486 --> 00:13:56,411
Sounds like you're
accusing us of something.

281
00:13:56,488 --> 00:13:59,039
I heard the poor chap
got stabbed 8 times.

282
00:13:59,115 --> 00:14:00,540
Messy way to go.

283
00:14:00,617 --> 00:14:02,417
You and he had
a falling out, Brick.

284
00:14:02,494 --> 00:14:04,586
Maybe we did,
and maybe we didn't.

285
00:14:04,663 --> 00:14:07,797
Maybe an innocent man is rotting
in the hole in your place.

286
00:14:07,808 --> 00:14:10,425
There are no innocent men in here, Queen.
You should know that.

287
00:14:10,502 --> 00:14:13,478
Brick, Stanley
didn't kill that guard.

288
00:14:13,555 --> 00:14:15,480
Well, I guess he's got
nothing to worry about.

289
00:14:15,557 --> 00:14:17,524
The truth will set him free.

290
00:14:19,728 --> 00:14:21,987
Go ahead.

291
00:14:22,064 --> 00:14:24,489
Then you can join your
friend in the hole.

292
00:14:27,352 --> 00:14:29,611
Hey, Brick.

293
00:14:29,622 --> 00:14:32,447
If you or anyone in your crew

294
00:14:32,524 --> 00:14:37,753
had something to do with
this, I'll find out.

295
00:14:41,675 --> 00:14:43,175
Come on.

296
00:14:45,161 --> 00:14:47,671
Meet pyotr roslov...

297
00:14:47,681 --> 00:14:51,841
Former kgb, lots of deep, scary
ties to the Russian military.

298
00:14:51,852 --> 00:14:53,802
Oh. He looks like
a real charmer.

299
00:14:53,878 --> 00:14:57,022
Hmm. He is not. Pyotr and
I were associates at kgb,

300
00:14:57,099 --> 00:14:59,808
but we had a disagreement.

301
00:14:59,884 --> 00:15:01,976
Then why did Diaz
have you call him?

302
00:15:02,053 --> 00:15:04,854
Diaz wants to buy some kind of
very powerful weapon from him.

303
00:15:04,865 --> 00:15:06,606
He wants to destroy Oliver Queen

304
00:15:06,617 --> 00:15:09,192
by destroying
what he loves, his city.

305
00:15:09,203 --> 00:15:11,036
That's why Diaz
was trying to steal

306
00:15:11,113 --> 00:15:12,737
the directed energy weapon.

307
00:15:12,814 --> 00:15:14,781
And whatever was at the CDC.

308
00:15:14,858 --> 00:15:17,042
We find out where Diaz plans to
launch his attack, we snag him there,

309
00:15:17,119 --> 00:15:19,869
we find out what roslov
sold him,

310
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,663
and you're gonna help us.

311
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,498
No, no, no. No.
Pyotr can smell a rat.

312
00:15:23,575 --> 00:15:25,217
Anatoly, we will help you.

313
00:15:25,293 --> 00:15:27,293
I play hero once before,

314
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:29,888
and Diaz killed all of my
brothers as punishment.

315
00:15:29,965 --> 00:15:32,507
- Never again.
- Oliver was your brother, too,

316
00:15:32,584 --> 00:15:34,551
and he would want you
to help us get Diaz.

317
00:15:34,561 --> 00:15:36,895
Yeah, but Oliver tried
to do the same thing.

318
00:15:36,972 --> 00:15:39,806
Look where he is now. No. Time for
me to go somewhere nice, tropical.

319
00:15:39,817 --> 00:15:41,233
Maldives maybe.

320
00:15:41,309 --> 00:15:43,235
I think it's
really hard to travel

321
00:15:43,311 --> 00:15:45,353
when you're on homeland
security's most wanted list.

322
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:47,614
Yes, but I am on no such...

323
00:15:51,227 --> 00:15:52,902
You are threatening me?

324
00:15:52,913 --> 00:15:54,696
Call it an enthusiastic
suggestion.

325
00:15:54,707 --> 00:15:56,865
A couple minutes
in roslov's office,

326
00:15:56,941 --> 00:15:58,575
you download his hard drive,

327
00:15:58,651 --> 00:16:00,160
you're on your way
to the Maldives.

328
00:16:00,236 --> 00:16:02,996
You're not Felicity Smoak
I remember.

329
00:16:03,072 --> 00:16:05,248
Well, she couldn't catch Diaz.

330
00:16:05,259 --> 00:16:07,050
Maybe this one can.

331
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,272
I got a visual.

332
00:16:30,809 --> 00:16:33,660
Anatoly Knyazev.

333
00:16:49,118 --> 00:16:51,136
He's in.

334
00:16:51,213 --> 00:16:52,879
I suppose I owe
you a debt of gratitude

335
00:16:52,956 --> 00:16:55,757
for sending the dragon
my way, Knyazev.

336
00:16:55,834 --> 00:16:59,928
Oh. I'm pleased your dealings with Mr.
Diaz were, uh, profitable.

337
00:17:00,004 --> 00:17:03,148
Oh. Yes.
Very profitable.

338
00:17:03,225 --> 00:17:07,769
Speaking of, you need
4k TV, sarin gas?

339
00:17:07,846 --> 00:17:11,898
All fall off truck, I swear.

340
00:17:11,975 --> 00:17:14,734
Anatoly, you
need to get to that computer.

341
00:17:14,811 --> 00:17:17,496
Eh, pyotr, why don't we sit down

342
00:17:17,572 --> 00:17:19,539
like old friends?

343
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:24,085
Good. Now distract
him and insert the drive.

344
00:17:25,864 --> 00:17:27,622
Something wrong?

345
00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:30,550
I... I was promised
drink.

346
00:17:35,516 --> 00:17:39,392
Um, on rocks...
Please.

347
00:17:46,401 --> 00:17:47,851
Good.

348
00:17:49,762 --> 00:17:52,438
He's got incoming. Anatoly's
been compromised.

349
00:17:52,515 --> 00:17:54,199
We have to get him out of there.

350
00:17:54,276 --> 00:17:55,942
The drive still needs a minute
before he can retrieve the data.

351
00:17:56,019 --> 00:17:57,819
Felicity, he doesn't
have a minute.

352
00:17:57,896 --> 00:17:59,529
Anatoly, there is
no immediate threat.

353
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,030
Keep him talking.

354
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:03,366
Forgive me, pyotr.

355
00:18:03,443 --> 00:18:05,326
Felicity!

356
00:18:05,403 --> 00:18:08,830
Losing bratva was very painful.

357
00:18:08,907 --> 00:18:12,500
The pain taught me to see all
the pain that I have inflicted.

358
00:18:12,577 --> 00:18:16,972
I'm hoping that you can see it
in your heart to forgive me.

359
00:18:20,043 --> 00:18:23,052
A snake may shed its skin,

360
00:18:23,063 --> 00:18:26,398
but it is still a snake.

361
00:18:38,978 --> 00:18:40,245
Go!

362
00:19:02,168 --> 00:19:04,102
Anatoly.

363
00:19:04,179 --> 00:19:06,429
God. Yes. We got it.

364
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,231
Damn it.

365
00:19:11,438 --> 00:19:13,105
Hey. How's Anatoly?

366
00:19:13,181 --> 00:19:14,531
He'll be out cold
for a few hours,

367
00:19:14,608 --> 00:19:16,024
but he'll be fine.

368
00:19:16,035 --> 00:19:17,317
- Good.
- Felicity, it wouldn't have been

369
00:19:17,394 --> 00:19:18,819
if I showed up
a few seconds later.

370
00:19:18,895 --> 00:19:20,278
But he is fine, and we got this.

371
00:19:20,355 --> 00:19:21,947
It's encrypted
and probably in cyrillic,

372
00:19:22,023 --> 00:19:23,532
so it's gonna take me
a while to decode,

373
00:19:23,542 --> 00:19:25,534
but it is a huge lead
on what Diaz is planning.

374
00:19:25,544 --> 00:19:27,285
And this would have been
worth Anatoly's life?

375
00:19:27,362 --> 00:19:28,787
Well, think about how many
lives we're gonna lose

376
00:19:28,864 --> 00:19:30,831
if we don't stop Diaz.

377
00:19:30,907 --> 00:19:32,708
We all have to take risks
in the field, dig.

378
00:19:32,784 --> 00:19:34,668
That's true, but this was a risk

379
00:19:34,745 --> 00:19:36,670
that you coerced him
into taking, Felicity.

380
00:19:36,747 --> 00:19:39,881
I'm sorry that
he got hurt, I am,

381
00:19:39,892 --> 00:19:43,060
but we got intel on Diaz
because I didn't give up.

382
00:19:43,137 --> 00:19:45,887
Give up? Felicity,
I didn't give up.

383
00:19:45,898 --> 00:19:48,014
You pushed me out. You wanted
to do things your way,

384
00:19:48,091 --> 00:19:49,566
and I supported that decision,

385
00:19:49,643 --> 00:19:51,068
but that was before
I knew your decision

386
00:19:51,145 --> 00:19:52,853
involved risking innocent lives.

387
00:19:52,929 --> 00:19:55,072
Anatoly is hardly a girl scout,

388
00:19:55,149 --> 00:19:58,442
and don't lecture me, especially
because you haven't been around.

389
00:19:58,518 --> 00:20:01,319
I am willing to do whatever
it takes to end this.

390
00:20:01,396 --> 00:20:03,530
But then what?

391
00:20:03,607 --> 00:20:05,699
Felicity, I've known you
for a long time,

392
00:20:05,776 --> 00:20:07,576
and you are a good person,

393
00:20:07,586 --> 00:20:09,077
but I've been
to the front lines,

394
00:20:09,088 --> 00:20:11,088
and I know exactly
what that does to people.

395
00:20:11,165 --> 00:20:14,332
I just hope when
this war is over,

396
00:20:14,409 --> 00:20:16,635
you still come out a hero.

397
00:20:36,523 --> 00:20:40,025
Hey. You ok?

398
00:20:40,101 --> 00:20:44,121
The guards, they took
turns hitting me.

399
00:20:44,198 --> 00:20:45,956
They think I killed
their friend.

400
00:20:46,033 --> 00:20:47,741
Stanley, did they say why?

401
00:20:47,818 --> 00:20:51,578
They haven't even found
the murder weapon.

402
00:20:51,655 --> 00:20:53,747
Dunbar's a jerk,
but I would never hurt him.

403
00:20:53,824 --> 00:20:55,957
I would never hurt anyone.

404
00:20:55,968 --> 00:20:58,752
Oliver, if they pin this on me,

405
00:20:58,829 --> 00:21:00,804
I'm gonna be in here forever.

406
00:21:00,881 --> 00:21:02,756
Hey. I'm not gonna
let that happen.

407
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,925
I heard that it happened
in the shower.

408
00:21:05,001 --> 00:21:06,885
- Ok.
- But that doesn't even

409
00:21:06,962 --> 00:21:10,481
make sense because I wasn't even
close to there when that guy...

410
00:21:10,557 --> 00:21:14,476
I know if anyone can find
out what really happened,

411
00:21:14,553 --> 00:21:16,645
it's the Green Arrow.

412
00:21:16,655 --> 00:21:18,271
Just sit tight, ok?

413
00:21:18,348 --> 00:21:19,981
Ok.

414
00:22:10,066 --> 00:22:11,583
Of course.

415
00:22:14,696 --> 00:22:17,289
I'm sure you're
wondering what a state D.A.

416
00:22:17,365 --> 00:22:19,291
Is doing here in federal court,

417
00:22:19,367 --> 00:22:21,552
representing someone on the
opposite side of the law.

418
00:22:21,628 --> 00:22:24,379
I am.
This is highly unusual.

419
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:27,766
I'm here as an officer
of the court.

420
00:22:30,921 --> 00:22:36,474
This... is Oliver Queen's
current condition.

421
00:22:36,551 --> 00:22:39,236
He has been
psychologically tortured,

422
00:22:39,313 --> 00:22:41,980
harassed, and assaulted.

423
00:22:42,057 --> 00:22:44,858
Upon information and belief,
Mr. Queen also had

424
00:22:44,935 --> 00:22:46,910
the opportunity
to escape Slabside

425
00:22:46,987 --> 00:22:50,530
but instead smuggled information
out to help his fellow inmates.

426
00:22:50,607 --> 00:22:53,867
And you feel these things
should negate his conviction?

427
00:22:53,944 --> 00:22:56,670
Yes. Oliver Queen made
a deal with the FBI

428
00:22:56,747 --> 00:22:59,497
to protect his city,
but the FBI failed

429
00:22:59,574 --> 00:23:01,207
to hold up their end
of the bargain.

430
00:23:01,284 --> 00:23:04,261
Meanwhile, Diaz has
continued to commit

431
00:23:04,338 --> 00:23:06,713
numerous other crimes
and nearly succeeded

432
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:09,266
in murdering Mr. Queen's
wife and child

433
00:23:09,343 --> 00:23:11,268
while they were
in federal witness protection.

434
00:23:11,345 --> 00:23:13,553
Anything further,
Ms. Lance?

435
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:18,516
Your honor, the hardest
thing to do is to be a hero

436
00:23:18,593 --> 00:23:20,894
when no one expects you to be.

437
00:23:20,971 --> 00:23:23,521
The easier path
is to be a criminal.

438
00:23:23,598 --> 00:23:26,900
The past 6 months,
Oliver Queen has chosen

439
00:23:26,977 --> 00:23:30,528
the hard road and has been
a hero in terrible conditions,

440
00:23:30,605 --> 00:23:34,115
and since the FBI has not
held up their end of the deal,

441
00:23:34,126 --> 00:23:37,285
Oliver Queen deserves
to be a free man.

442
00:23:37,296 --> 00:23:39,913
I agree that
a federal investigation

443
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:43,625
into the conditions
of Slabside should be ordered.

444
00:23:43,636 --> 00:23:47,545
However, I'm unconvinced that Mr. Queen
should be released at this time.

445
00:23:47,622 --> 00:23:49,640
Therefore,
his conviction stands.

446
00:23:49,716 --> 00:23:51,549
Your appeal is denied.

447
00:23:55,314 --> 00:23:56,763
Got your message.
Are you in?

448
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,315
Felicity had the brilliant idea

449
00:23:58,392 --> 00:23:59,933
to use a cyrillic dictionary
attack on the table

450
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:01,318
of hashed passwords.

451
00:24:01,395 --> 00:24:03,103
It was pretty brilliant of me.

452
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:04,896
Our friend roslov, on the
other hand, less brilliant.

453
00:24:04,973 --> 00:24:06,481
His decryption key
is the Russian equivalent

454
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:08,149
of "password69."

455
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,567
Once we translated all the data,

456
00:24:09,644 --> 00:24:10,994
this is what we got.

457
00:24:11,071 --> 00:24:13,863
Say hello to betab-500.

458
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,407
Yeah. That's a
top-of-the-line aerial explosive,

459
00:24:15,483 --> 00:24:17,033
razor-thin precision,

460
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,835
able to cut through
concrete like nothing.

461
00:24:18,912 --> 00:24:20,996
Well, Diaz has two of them,

462
00:24:21,006 --> 00:24:22,580
so that means our list of
potential targets just doubled.

463
00:24:22,657 --> 00:24:24,007
Keep working on that hard drive.

464
00:24:24,084 --> 00:24:25,583
What are you gonna do?

465
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,219
Prepare for a mass evac of Star City.

466
00:24:33,796 --> 00:24:35,763
Why'd you do it, Turner?

467
00:24:35,773 --> 00:24:37,431
What the hell are you talking about?

468
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:38,724
Why'd you kill Dunbar?

469
00:24:38,801 --> 00:24:40,100
I didn't kill that guard.

470
00:24:40,177 --> 00:24:41,785
Your blade says you did.

471
00:24:45,516 --> 00:24:47,441
Guards found prints on it.

472
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:49,735
Turner, you're going
to the hole,

473
00:24:49,812 --> 00:24:52,112
and this time, you're
never coming out.

474
00:24:52,189 --> 00:24:56,667
You did this? W-wait.
You got the wrong guy.

475
00:24:58,089 --> 00:25:00,667
You got the wrong guy.
I didn't do this.

476
00:25:11,458 --> 00:25:13,592
Hey. I heard you were up.

477
00:25:13,669 --> 00:25:14,885
How are you feeling?

478
00:25:14,962 --> 00:25:16,762
Heart pounding in head.

479
00:25:16,773 --> 00:25:20,599
Each beat... pow...
Like knife to brain.

480
00:25:20,676 --> 00:25:25,479
I'm sorry. I should have
gotten you out sooner.

481
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:28,774
So you are not new
Felicity Smoak after all.

482
00:25:28,851 --> 00:25:31,568
What do you mean?

483
00:25:31,645 --> 00:25:33,662
You want to be ruthless

484
00:25:33,739 --> 00:25:35,322
to pursue madman,

485
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:36,990
I'll not judge you.

486
00:25:37,001 --> 00:25:39,660
I am, after all,
wanted criminal.

487
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:42,171
I actually thought you'd be more
pissed I almost got you killed.

488
00:25:42,248 --> 00:25:44,173
Yeah. Of course
I'm angry.

489
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,958
You threaten my life,

490
00:25:46,034 --> 00:25:48,627
but I don't like apologies.

491
00:25:48,704 --> 00:25:51,839
You cannot take away
mistake by wishing it so.

492
00:25:51,849 --> 00:25:54,591
In my line of work,
you make choice,

493
00:25:54,668 --> 00:25:56,635
you do not look back.

494
00:25:56,712 --> 00:26:01,807
Ah. So you don't regret working
against us with Diaz last year?

495
00:26:01,884 --> 00:26:08,647
Regret, guilt. These are demons
you choose to live with,

496
00:26:08,724 --> 00:26:11,441
a trade you make
to get what you want.

497
00:26:11,518 --> 00:26:13,702
How bad do you want
to kill Ricardo Diaz?

498
00:26:13,779 --> 00:26:15,445
More than anything.

499
00:26:15,522 --> 00:26:19,032
Well, then you embrace demons.

500
00:26:19,043 --> 00:26:21,827
No more half measures.

501
00:26:21,904 --> 00:26:25,330
When I work with Oliver
in Russia,

502
00:26:25,407 --> 00:26:27,332
he was not villain,

503
00:26:27,409 --> 00:26:30,836
but he did what
needed to be done.

504
00:26:30,913 --> 00:26:33,430
You remind me of him then.

505
00:26:35,634 --> 00:26:39,845
What would that Oliver
have done in this situation?

506
00:26:39,856 --> 00:26:42,681
He would have ended Diaz,

507
00:26:42,758 --> 00:26:45,109
and he wouldn't care
about the cost.

508
00:26:58,324 --> 00:27:00,991
Hey! Laurel,
you look a little upset.

509
00:27:01,068 --> 00:27:02,451
Why don't we go cool off?

510
00:27:02,527 --> 00:27:03,952
Get out of my way.

511
00:27:04,029 --> 00:27:06,496
It seems like you were
about to open your mouth

512
00:27:06,573 --> 00:27:08,415
and do something you're
going to regret, counselor.

513
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:10,250
I'm not an attorney,

514
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:12,502
as you've reminded me
many times.

515
00:27:12,579 --> 00:27:14,305
You sure looked like one
in that courtroom today.

516
00:27:14,381 --> 00:27:16,882
Yeah. Well, it doesn't
matter, does it?

517
00:27:16,893 --> 00:27:18,926
Oliver's not getting
out of prison.

518
00:27:18,936 --> 00:27:20,436
Now, if you don't mind, I have

519
00:27:20,512 --> 00:27:22,930
some unfinished business
with that judge.

520
00:27:23,006 --> 00:27:25,223
Did you even bother to
listen to yourself in court?

521
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,276
You spoke from your heart.

522
00:27:27,353 --> 00:27:29,353
Big surprise, by the way,
you do have one.

523
00:27:29,429 --> 00:27:31,447
You said, "the hardest
thing to do was to be a hero

524
00:27:31,523 --> 00:27:33,523
"when no one expects you to be.

525
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,859
The easier path
is to be a criminal."

526
00:27:35,936 --> 00:27:37,736
What do you care, anyway?

527
00:27:37,813 --> 00:27:41,290
If anybody knows the
true me, the real me,

528
00:27:41,367 --> 00:27:43,292
it's you.

529
00:27:43,369 --> 00:27:45,294
You know, you've been telling
people for 6 months now

530
00:27:45,371 --> 00:27:46,870
you've changed.

531
00:27:46,947 --> 00:27:48,914
It wasn't until I saw
you in that courtroom

532
00:27:48,991 --> 00:27:51,750
that I actually believed it.

533
00:27:51,827 --> 00:27:56,338
Do not throw that away just
because it's getting hard now.

534
00:27:56,349 --> 00:28:01,268
I don't want you coming to one of
my court appearances ever again.

535
00:28:10,804 --> 00:28:12,980
This has to be
where Felicity was hiding out.

536
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:15,148
Yeah, but doing what?

537
00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:16,984
Uh, guys.

538
00:28:16,994 --> 00:28:19,403
You have
triggered security protocols.

539
00:28:19,479 --> 00:28:21,947
If you do not provide
access credentials

540
00:28:22,024 --> 00:28:24,124
in 30 seconds,

541
00:28:24,201 --> 00:28:25,960
you will be terminated.

542
00:28:28,655 --> 00:28:30,455
All our weapons were targeted.

543
00:28:30,532 --> 00:28:31,915
Please say you can hack this.

544
00:28:31,992 --> 00:28:33,417
Hack Felicity?
Yeah, right!

545
00:28:35,421 --> 00:28:36,753
She wouldn't lead us here
without access.

546
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:38,138
What are those?

547
00:28:43,354 --> 00:28:45,762
No freakin' way.

548
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:47,106
Get the bow.

549
00:28:50,677 --> 00:28:52,778
Remember how
my dad used to train?

550
00:29:06,193 --> 00:29:08,377
Access granted.

551
00:29:08,454 --> 00:29:11,997
You'd think Felicity would
have made that a lot easier.

552
00:29:12,074 --> 00:29:14,550
She's obviously
trying to protect something.

553
00:29:14,626 --> 00:29:16,927
I'll bring up the last
files she accessed.

554
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:19,838
These are structural maps

555
00:29:19,915 --> 00:29:21,840
of all the buildings
throughout Star City.

556
00:29:21,917 --> 00:29:23,726
City hall, central library,

557
00:29:23,802 --> 00:29:25,302
old rockets arena...

558
00:29:25,378 --> 00:29:26,887
All areas outside the Glades.

559
00:29:26,897 --> 00:29:28,814
Yeah. Along with schematics
to build explosives

560
00:29:28,891 --> 00:29:30,607
and the money to fund it.

561
00:29:35,764 --> 00:29:39,575
This is a plan to level
all of Star City.

562
00:29:43,914 --> 00:29:45,989
What you got?

563
00:29:46,066 --> 00:29:48,584
Anatoly said in order to catch Diaz,
I couldn't worry about the cost.

564
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,243
Felicity, you know how
I feel about this.

565
00:29:50,254 --> 00:29:51,828
I know, and that's not
the point.

566
00:29:51,905 --> 00:29:53,705
The point is that Diaz
does worry about the cost.

567
00:29:53,782 --> 00:29:55,499
I mean, it's basically
his whole M.O.

568
00:29:55,575 --> 00:29:57,009
Diaz wants to make a statement.

569
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:58,710
The man carries around
a flamethrower.

570
00:29:58,787 --> 00:30:00,637
Subtlety isn't his strong suit.

571
00:30:00,714 --> 00:30:02,431
So I started wondering, what is
a statement worthy of a dragon?

572
00:30:02,508 --> 00:30:04,424
I ran an algorithm
cross-referencing

573
00:30:04,435 --> 00:30:06,676
the betab-500 and the
manufacturer's specification.

574
00:30:06,753 --> 00:30:09,054
Turns out that this model
is a new version,

575
00:30:09,065 --> 00:30:11,014
where you can attach
it to a pipe.

576
00:30:11,091 --> 00:30:14,109
For instance, a pipe
underground filled with gas.

577
00:30:14,186 --> 00:30:15,611
- Gas plant.
- Mm-hmm.

578
00:30:15,687 --> 00:30:17,229
That building's
totally fireproof.

579
00:30:17,305 --> 00:30:18,447
Rest of the city, not so much.

580
00:30:18,524 --> 00:30:20,273
If Diaz sets off those bombs,

581
00:30:20,284 --> 00:30:21,900
a whole river of gas
underneath the city

582
00:30:21,977 --> 00:30:23,610
goes up in flames literally.

583
00:30:23,687 --> 00:30:25,445
Ok. A.R.G.U.S. will
continue the evac.

584
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:26,947
We'll handle these bombs.

585
00:30:26,957 --> 00:30:28,782
Does that mean what
I think it means?

586
00:30:28,793 --> 00:30:30,408
Call the whole team.
We're gonna need all the help

587
00:30:30,485 --> 00:30:32,669
we can get on this one.

588
00:30:35,553 --> 00:30:37,053
I miss good old says

589
00:30:37,129 --> 00:30:38,796
when bomb could be turned
off by computer far away

590
00:30:38,872 --> 00:30:40,381
in dark warehouse.

591
00:30:40,391 --> 00:30:41,965
Yeah. These are not
those type of bombs,

592
00:30:42,042 --> 00:30:43,717
and since we're on the
topic of freaking out,

593
00:30:43,728 --> 00:30:45,302
the bombs are linked, which
means we can't disarm one

594
00:30:45,379 --> 00:30:46,771
without detonating the other.

595
00:30:46,847 --> 00:30:49,256
Which means we'll have to
disarm them at the exact same time.

596
00:30:49,267 --> 00:30:52,568
It's like
the world's worst trust fall.

597
00:30:53,145 --> 00:30:56,572
Ohh. I was hoping it would
look less scary in person.

598
00:30:56,648 --> 00:30:58,648
- Wishful thinking.
- Bogey number one is attached

599
00:30:58,725 --> 00:31:00,567
to the main pipeline leading
straight into Star City.

600
00:31:00,578 --> 00:31:02,485
We got eyes on the second bomb.

601
00:31:02,562 --> 00:31:05,906
Guys, this timer's
started already.

602
00:31:05,916 --> 00:31:07,749
Mine, too.

603
00:31:07,826 --> 00:31:09,710
This timer was
activated manually.

604
00:31:09,786 --> 00:31:12,412
Diaz is still here.

605
00:31:13,632 --> 00:31:14,748
Dinah, meet me outside.

606
00:31:14,758 --> 00:31:16,124
Anatoly, Rene.

607
00:31:16,135 --> 00:31:17,751
We'll keep an eye
on the bomb squad.

608
00:31:17,827 --> 00:31:19,344
Bring in our exfil.

609
00:31:19,421 --> 00:31:23,715
I want to watch the fireworks
from above.

610
00:31:23,792 --> 00:31:26,092
Curtis, each linking device is
protected by its own crypto-key.

611
00:31:26,103 --> 00:31:29,771
We decrypt the passcodes, and then we
input them at the exact same time.

612
00:31:29,848 --> 00:31:31,565
Yeah. I'm gonna need a little
bit more time on my end.

613
00:31:31,642 --> 00:31:33,183
You got the easy bomb.

614
00:31:33,259 --> 00:31:34,559
We do not have more time.

615
00:31:34,636 --> 00:31:36,278
- When can we run?
- Not now.

616
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:41,942
Guys, we have a problem.

617
00:31:42,018 --> 00:31:43,777
My little bundle of joy came
with a backup detonator.

618
00:31:43,853 --> 00:31:45,370
- Cell phone transmitter.
- Can you remove it?

619
00:31:45,447 --> 00:31:47,405
Not if we don't want
to set it off.

620
00:31:47,482 --> 00:31:49,124
We can't input those passcodes
until we have that master phone.

621
00:31:49,201 --> 00:31:51,284
Once Diaz realizes that
the timers have been stopped...

622
00:31:51,295 --> 00:31:55,664
He blows us up with phone call.
Festive.

623
00:31:55,674 --> 00:31:58,667
You go get that phone.
I got this.

624
00:32:10,463 --> 00:32:13,139
Got the passcode.
Ready to input it.

625
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:16,401
I'm ready, too.
Dig, Rene, do you copy?

626
00:32:18,906 --> 00:32:20,322
Anyone?

627
00:32:46,458 --> 00:32:48,591
Come on. Come on, Rene.

628
00:33:07,479 --> 00:33:08,945
We cannot wait any longer.

629
00:33:09,022 --> 00:33:10,539
They're gonna come through.

630
00:33:10,615 --> 00:33:15,127
Ok. On 3.
1, 2, 3, type.

631
00:33:21,844 --> 00:33:23,552
Now we run.

632
00:33:26,915 --> 00:33:29,057
Impressive,

633
00:33:29,134 --> 00:33:30,383
but it's pointless.

634
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:37,024
Impossible.

635
00:34:08,877 --> 00:34:10,862
Breaking news out of Star City.

636
00:34:10,867 --> 00:34:14,579
Notorious fugitive Ricardo
Diaz is behind bars tonight,

637
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:17,683
thanks to the efforts
of the unidentified Green Arrow.

638
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,852
Earlier this evening,
the vigilante foiled

639
00:34:19,928 --> 00:34:22,688
an attempted bombing
at the natural gas plant,

640
00:34:22,765 --> 00:34:26,024
leaving many to wonder
should the anti-vigilante law

641
00:34:26,101 --> 00:34:27,910
be revoked.

642
00:34:29,488 --> 00:34:31,905
Well, just like the good old days, huh?

643
00:34:31,916 --> 00:34:33,699
The Green Arrow swooping
in to save the day.

644
00:34:33,776 --> 00:34:35,918
We do all the work,
and he gets all the credit.

645
00:34:35,995 --> 00:34:37,870
About time he got some credit.

646
00:34:37,946 --> 00:34:39,747
The important thing is
we caught Diaz.

647
00:34:39,757 --> 00:34:41,790
And this is a huge
collar for the SCPD.

648
00:34:41,867 --> 00:34:43,926
The feds are gonna be pissed
they didn't get him first,

649
00:34:44,003 --> 00:34:46,095
and we are gonna charge Diaz
with every crime in the book.

650
00:34:46,172 --> 00:34:48,547
Guys, we caught Diaz.

651
00:34:48,624 --> 00:34:50,591
This is what can happen
when we all work together.

652
00:34:50,601 --> 00:34:52,342
I don't want to say
I told you so...

653
00:34:52,419 --> 00:34:54,136
- But you are, right?
- Yeah.

654
00:34:54,213 --> 00:34:56,105
You know what? Let's
go get a drink and celebrate.

655
00:34:56,182 --> 00:34:57,857
- We deserve it, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

656
00:35:01,946 --> 00:35:07,783
Well, Felicity, after
everything, you did it.

657
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,860
How's it feel?

658
00:35:09,937 --> 00:35:15,124
Well... Diaz is
behind bars.

659
00:35:15,201 --> 00:35:18,577
What could be better than that?

660
00:35:18,654 --> 00:35:21,455
I mean, I thought
I made myself clear.

661
00:35:21,532 --> 00:35:23,466
I don't want your help.

662
00:35:23,542 --> 00:35:25,134
That's just too bad because
as your legal counsel,

663
00:35:25,211 --> 00:35:28,962
I am obligated to inform
you of your case status.

664
00:35:28,973 --> 00:35:31,715
That should be your copy
of the court's ruling.

665
00:35:31,792 --> 00:35:33,759
Spoiler alert...
We lost.

666
00:35:33,836 --> 00:35:35,344
Must be difficult to win a case

667
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:38,096
when you're not a real lawyer.

668
00:35:38,173 --> 00:35:41,642
Says here the judge is
ordering an investigation

669
00:35:41,652 --> 00:35:45,145
into prisoner abuse at Slabside?

670
00:35:45,156 --> 00:35:46,980
Turns out the government
isn't a big fan

671
00:35:46,991 --> 00:35:48,991
of lobotomizing their prisoners.

672
00:35:52,479 --> 00:35:56,156
That will help a lot
of people in here.

673
00:35:56,167 --> 00:35:57,541
Ahem. Thank you.

674
00:35:57,618 --> 00:35:59,618
I don't want your thanks.

675
00:35:59,695 --> 00:36:02,338
I didn't do this for you.
I did this for me,

676
00:36:02,414 --> 00:36:05,791
and, no, I am not your Laurel.

677
00:36:05,868 --> 00:36:09,178
I'm not the old Laurel.
I'm me.

678
00:36:09,255 --> 00:36:11,630
Everyone has good
and bad inside of them,

679
00:36:11,707 --> 00:36:15,726
and you can't put people
in one box or the other ever.

680
00:36:45,291 --> 00:36:46,957
Vodka?

681
00:36:47,034 --> 00:36:48,667
What, because I am Russian?

682
00:36:48,744 --> 00:36:50,836
That is stereotype,

683
00:36:50,913 --> 00:36:52,629
but da, yes, vodka.

684
00:36:52,706 --> 00:36:54,464
I only have a bit left.

685
00:36:54,541 --> 00:36:56,466
I hope they have vodka
in the Maldives,

686
00:36:56,543 --> 00:36:58,978
that is, if you can do
an American accent.

687
00:37:01,891 --> 00:37:04,224
Hello. I am Jason brown

688
00:37:04,235 --> 00:37:06,476
from Denver, Colorado.

689
00:37:06,553 --> 00:37:07,769
Heh.

690
00:37:07,846 --> 00:37:09,396
Spasiba.

691
00:37:09,407 --> 00:37:12,190
You're a strong person,
Felicity Smoak.

692
00:37:12,267 --> 00:37:14,201
You catch dragon.

693
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:19,206
Now don't look back.

694
00:37:24,071 --> 00:37:26,079
Doesn't make any sense.

695
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:29,499
Felicity wouldn't do
something like this.

696
00:37:29,576 --> 00:37:32,920
Like we said, she changed.

697
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:34,713
Ok. Let's say you're right

698
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:37,507
and Felicity somehow
became Overwatch of evil.

699
00:37:37,584 --> 00:37:39,009
Why lead us here?

700
00:37:39,086 --> 00:37:40,719
Maybe she had a change of heart,

701
00:37:40,796 --> 00:37:42,512
tried to back out last second.

702
00:37:42,589 --> 00:37:44,514
It'd explain why someone
would want her dead, right?

703
00:37:44,591 --> 00:37:46,275
Not to state the obvious,

704
00:37:46,352 --> 00:37:47,851
but if we start poking
around, it's gonna make

705
00:37:47,928 --> 00:37:49,686
us targets, too.

706
00:37:49,763 --> 00:37:52,105
None of us have any idea what
Felicity's intentions were

707
00:37:52,116 --> 00:37:54,733
or why she reached out to you.

708
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:57,444
Following this lead
means taking a risk.

709
00:37:57,455 --> 00:38:01,114
I don't know what happened to
Felicity these past few years,

710
00:38:01,125 --> 00:38:05,911
but what I do know is there was a
time when all of us loved her.

711
00:38:05,988 --> 00:38:08,964
Isn't finding out what really
happened worth the risk?

712
00:38:11,994 --> 00:38:17,130
Fine. We'll start by tracking
down whoever she contacted last.

713
00:38:17,207 --> 00:38:21,218
Ok. Last call out was to someone named...

714
00:38:21,294 --> 00:38:22,803
Blackstar.

715
00:38:22,813 --> 00:38:24,638
That doesn't sound ominous at all.

716
00:38:24,649 --> 00:38:26,315
I swear to god, if this gets me killed,

717
00:38:26,392 --> 00:38:28,400
- I'm gonna murder you.
- Noted.

718
00:38:39,604 --> 00:38:42,781
I liked you better with pink hair.

719
00:38:42,792 --> 00:38:45,784
You don't scare me.

720
00:38:45,861 --> 00:38:50,163
I don't think that's true.

721
00:38:50,174 --> 00:38:52,582
See that camera?

722
00:38:52,593 --> 00:38:54,459
No red light.

723
00:38:54,536 --> 00:38:57,170
That means you and I
are completely alone.

724
00:38:57,181 --> 00:38:59,172
Hmm.

725
00:38:59,183 --> 00:39:03,677
You took my husband from me.

726
00:39:03,688 --> 00:39:07,356
I had to send my son away.

727
00:39:07,433 --> 00:39:11,360
You destroyed my life.

728
00:39:11,437 --> 00:39:13,862
What you gonna do about it?

729
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:25,615
You don't have the guts.

730
00:39:25,692 --> 00:39:28,118
No. I do.

731
00:39:28,195 --> 00:39:31,371
You see, that's the problem.

732
00:39:31,382 --> 00:39:36,552
I do have the guts because
you made me into this person.

733
00:39:39,372 --> 00:39:41,432
Hmm?

734
00:39:41,508 --> 00:39:43,142
Go ahead.

735
00:39:47,139 --> 00:39:51,233
Sweetheart, this is
the big boys' table.

736
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:53,152
You should leave.

737
00:39:56,824 --> 00:39:58,407
Felicity, don't.

738
00:39:58,484 --> 00:39:59,816
Couldn't be without me,
could you, baby?

739
00:39:59,827 --> 00:40:01,410
I'm ending him, Laurel.

740
00:40:01,487 --> 00:40:04,246
No. You don't want to
do this, trust me.

741
00:40:04,323 --> 00:40:06,415
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't!

742
00:40:06,492 --> 00:40:10,160
We need him to help Oliver.

743
00:40:10,237 --> 00:40:11,712
What do you mean?

744
00:40:13,924 --> 00:40:19,428
I made a deal with the feds, a trade.

745
00:40:19,505 --> 00:40:22,506
Diaz for your husband.

746
00:40:22,582 --> 00:40:24,216
If Oliver agrees to assist them

747
00:40:24,292 --> 00:40:28,053
with their case against Diaz,

748
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:30,064
he'll be a free man again.

749
00:40:39,349 --> 00:40:42,692
Oliver's coming home?

750
00:40:42,769 --> 00:40:44,703
Yeah.

751
00:40:57,543 --> 00:40:59,084
How did you do it?

752
00:40:59,161 --> 00:41:00,919
I knew the Green Arrow was good,

753
00:41:00,996 --> 00:41:02,471
but I didn't think
he was that good.

754
00:41:02,548 --> 00:41:04,297
Stanley, I'm just glad you're ok.

755
00:41:04,308 --> 00:41:06,508
Ok? I'm great!
I was this close

756
00:41:06,585 --> 00:41:08,718
to being stuck in here
for the rest of my life.

757
00:41:08,795 --> 00:41:10,312
If you hadn't found
Turner's blade,

758
00:41:10,389 --> 00:41:12,356
it would have been
all over for me.

759
00:41:15,561 --> 00:41:17,853
How'd you know it was
Turner's blade?

760
00:41:17,929 --> 00:41:21,481
- What do you mean?
- You were in the hole, Stanley,

761
00:41:21,492 --> 00:41:26,736
so how'd you know
it was Turner's blade?

762
00:41:26,813 --> 00:41:29,623
I guess I must have
heard it somewhere.

763
00:41:32,578 --> 00:41:34,670
You gonna eat that?

764
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:45,400
