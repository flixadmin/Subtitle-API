1
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,324
They say if you
want to glimpse the future,

2
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,801
just look behind you.

3
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,650
I used to think
that was bollocks.

4
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,847
But now I realize

5
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,846
you can't outrun the past.

6
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,042
When we were kids,

7
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,368
you'd start fights with the
toughest bastards in the yard.

8
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,961
But I was the one who had
to step in and finish them.

9
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,001
Rest now, little brother,

10
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,845
while I settle
your one last score.

11
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,371
You take care of my brother.

12
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,363
Anything happens to him,

13
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,363
I'll come by looking for you.

14
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,882
Here. Hold this.

15
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,521
Grenade!

16
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,206
Come on, Dom. So where
are you taking me?

17
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,806
They say an open road
helps you think

18
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,441
about where you've been,
where you're going.

19
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,962
So you don't remember
any of this yet?

20
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,321
That's not fair.

21
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,966
You know I don't.

22
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,802
So what is it exactly that
you're trying to show me?

23
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,286
That.

24
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,841
Race Wars.

25
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,645
We used to come here?

26
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,801
"Come here"?

27
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,561
We invented it.

28
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,844
Keep it under 9,000 RPMs.

29
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,526
Kid's gonna fry his pistons
after the first 200.

30
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,842
You know that's not my style.
I gotta ride or die, right'?

31
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,724
How about you just ride
on this one?

32
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,441
Are you ready?

33
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,401
I know you're ready!

34
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,806
Go!

35
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,882
Hey, nice job.

36
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,321
Hey!

37
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,161
That's the girl
I heard so much about.

38
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,328
Where you been at,
ghost girl?

39
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,401
Ghost gm.

40
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,846
Letty, what the hell?

41
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,961
Huh?

42
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,283
Damn, dawg! Girl's still
got that swing, homie.

43
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,281
You never could
take a punch.

44
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,326
Right, right.

45
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,965
Hey, man.
I'm glad you're back, man.

46
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,280
It's good to see you!

47
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,369
Good to see you, Hector.

48
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,367
All right.
We made it, Jack.

49
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,807
Yeah, we made it!
Yeah, we made it.

50
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,962
Now I just gotta find
that door button.

51
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,122
Buddy, where's the door
button at? Do you know?

52
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,361
Hi.
Hey.

53
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,647
Yeah, of course. I'm new to this.

54
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,085
Yeah, you don't seem
like the minivan type.

55
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,241
No, not exactly.

56
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,446
Hey, buddy, you gonna
give me a high five?

57
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,010
Wait, wait, wait!
Wait, high five!

58
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,445
All right. Yeah, buddy.

59
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,487
Appreciate it. Thank you.

60
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,324
Don't worry. You'll get
used to this in no time.

61
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,563
Yeah, that's what
I'm afraid of.

62
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,410
First time I saw this,

63
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,442
lthought
it was kind of funny.

64
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,487
I guess now
the joke's on me.

65
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,206
What are you doing?

66
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,963
What I should've done
a long time ago.

67
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,810
LETTY; Stop it!

68
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,124
Look at it.

69
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,406
It's the truth.

70
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,249
That's the date
that I lost my memory.

71
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,324
That's the date
that Letty died

72
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,164
and I was born.
No.

73
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,087
You never died.

74
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,481
Do you know how hard it is
for me when you look at me

75
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,650
and you see me through
15 years of memories?

76
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,481
Every beautiful moment
we've ever had.

77
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,762
I see it in your eyes.

78
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,487
I can't give that to you.

79
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,849
I got nothing.

80
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,001
You got me.

81
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,403
And you've got
only a piece of me.

82
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,322
I have to find myself.

83
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,811
For me.

84
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,520
Goodbye, Dom.

85
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,848
You're disappointed,
aren't you?

86
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,205
What are you talking about?

87
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,646
The last arrest.

88
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,730
He was too easy.
Target didn't even run.

89
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,086
Ah, it's okay.

90
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,322
Gives me a chance
to hit the iron.

91
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,404
Also lets me work on
my stamping skills.

92
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,163
You're a terrible liar.

93
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,206
See you tomorrow, boss.

94
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,169
I'll see you then.
Don't stay too late.

95
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,163
I'll stay as long
as I want, woman.

96
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,089
I knew you would say that.

97
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,681
Elena?

98
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,930
What's this?

99
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,809
It's the letter of
recommendation you asked for.

100
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,451
Just know I meant
every word in there.

101
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,969
Thanks, Hobbs.

102
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,929
Thanks for everything.

103
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,570
Come on, way too sentimental right now.

104
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,721
Get home. Good night.

105
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,450
Okay. Good night.

106
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,366
Just one sec.

107
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,888
You sure as hell
ain't the IT guy.

108
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,961
So you better start talking

109
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,487
before I break that finger
six different ways

110
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,961
and stick it right where
the sun doesn't shine.

111
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,208
Agent Hobbs, right?

112
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,286
That's right.

113
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,723
I'm also the last
man on Earth

114
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,609
whose computer you want
to be hacking into.

115
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,969
You just earned yourself
a dance with the devil, boy.

116
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,130
You're under arrest.

117
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:26,330
Like I said, I'm here for the
team that crippled my brother.

118
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,331
There ain't no goddamn team.

119
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:33,007
It was just one man, and he's
standing right in front of you.

120
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,090
The lady was right.

121
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,250
You are a terrible liar.

122
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,845
Goddamn IT guys.

123
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,120
Hobbs!

124
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,046
On me!

125
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,450
Elena!

126
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,801
Hobbs?

127
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,406
Hobbs!

128
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,448
All right, buddy. We gotta go.
We're gonna be late.

129
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,167
Come on.

130
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,409
Okay, what do you think?

131
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,363
Parking brake slide
right up to the school?

132
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,447
Where's Mommy?

133
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,000
I don't know. She's up there.
She's coming.

134
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,366
On.

135
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,841
Here we go.

136
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,407
Watch your head.

137
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,124
Dom, you have
a package out here!

138
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,691
It's from Tokyo.

139
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,205
Tokyo'?

140
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,443
What? ls Han trying to convert
rne over to a turbocharger?

141
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,806
All right, you ready?

142
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,967
There we go.

143
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,325
JACK; Yeah! BRIAN: Hey, buddy.
Cars don't fly.

144
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,845
Hey, cars don't fly.

145
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,726
This one did, huh?

146
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:55,202
Brian in a minivan.
Things have changed.

147
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,647
He's struggling, Dom.

148
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,211
He doesn't
want me to see it,

149
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,762
but the white picket fence is like
an anchnr on him. I can tell.

150
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,170
I tried to talk to him the other night.
You know what he said?

151
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,041
He doesn't miss the girls,
he doesn't miss the cars.

152
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,726
He misses the bullets.

153
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,891
Let him settle in.
Give him time.

154
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,084
How does nine months sound?

155
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,167
I'm having another baby.

156
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,687
And you didn't tell him,
did you?

157
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,971
You gotta tell him.

158
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,170
I don't want him to be
disappointed with his life.

159
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,089
With me.

160
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,040
He will never be
disappointed with you.

161
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,771
You're the best thing
that's ever happened to him.

162
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,887
Thank you.

163
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,761
Yeah?

164
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,001
Dominic Toretto.

165
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,641
You don't know me.

166
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,051
<i>You're about to.</i>

167
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,411
Get down!

168
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,367
Jack!

169
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,601
Jack!

170
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,280
Shattered his collarbone,

171
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,601
fractured his leg
in two places.

172
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,409
He only regained
consciousness this morning.

173
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,848
The first thing he said was,
"Get me Dom."

174
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,321
He's in there.

175
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,405
Are you okay?

176
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,883
I'm fine.

177
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,409
He's waiting. Let's go.

178
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,722
Got something for you.

179
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,646
Your files.

180
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,051
Thank you.

181
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,289
You risk life and limb

182
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,850
to save the free world
and what do they give you'?

183
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:11,442
Jell-O and a bad
'70s TV show.

184
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,560
You know, it's got its perks.

185
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,563
- Sponge baths ain't that bad.
- Dad!

186
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,926
I'm sorry, baby.

187
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,843
“Dad”?

188
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,851
Honey, I want to introduce you
to somebody. He's a, uh...

189
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,680
He's an old friend.

190
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,000
Go on and say hello.

191
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,730
Dominic Toretto, right?

192
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:34,044
My dad said he
kicked your ass once.

193
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,248
Young lady,
watch your mouth.

194
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,241
Your dad's on
heavy pain meds.

195
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,441
I can understand if his
history is a little hazy.

196
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,488
I doubt it. All right,
honey, that's enough.

197
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,562
I want you to go get
something to eat with Elena

198
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,369
while me and Toretio
have a talk. You hear me?

199
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,204
Come on, lady.
Let's get some cookies.

200
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,964
Watch that mouth.

201
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,004
Who did this?

202
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,128
You remember Owen Shaw?

203
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,727
The one we tore half of
London down trying to get.

204
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,485
Well, this is his
big bad brother.

205
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,444
Take a look at this.

206
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,405
Deckard Shaw.

207
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,608
British Special
Forces assassin.

208
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,489
The kind of unique asset

209
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,801
that no government would
ever admit to employing.

210
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,121
Black Ops boys.

211
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,521
Worse.
They created a monster.

212
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,842
They felt Shaw
was a necessary evil

213
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,843
until eventually

214
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,361
they decided
he was unnecessary.

215
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,726
The powers that be

216
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,922
felt that he knew
just a little bit too much.

217
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,809
The asset became a liability.

218
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,850
So they sent in 20 elite
operatives to retire him.

219
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,440
And they missed.

220
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,601
That was six years ago,

221
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,250
and Shaw's been
a ghost ever since.

222
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,401
Until now.

223
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,489
HOW do I find him?

224
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,411
The official answer
is, you don't.

225
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,164
He killed Han.

226
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,080
Almost killed my family.

227
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,362
He also tried to put me
in a body bag, too.

228
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,171
Which is why when I get out, I'm
gonna put a hurt on him so bad

229
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,130
he's gonna wish his mama
had kept her legs closed.

230
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,646
But until then,
my official answer to you

231
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,446
is stand down.

232
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,762
Now, you know
I can't do that.

233
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,041
I do know you, Dom.

234
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,327
Which is why now I give you

235
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,289
the brother-to-brother answer.

236
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,443
You do whatever
it is you gotta do.

237
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,602
When you find that sumbitch,

238
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,450
just do me one favor.

239
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,210
What's that?

240
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,728
Don't miss.

241
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,848
Thank you so much
for letting us stay, Mando.

242
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,160
I hope it's not a problem.

243
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:52,369
Listen, Dom needed a safe
delivered to Rio in two days.

244
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,441
That was a problem.

245
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,568
Hosting his family
in the Dominican Republic,

246
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,801
that is vacation.

247
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,370
Anyone messes with you here,

248
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,329
they mess with
the entire country.

249
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,686
You'll be safe.

250
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,408
Yeah, yeah, they're here. I picked
them up myself at the airport.

251
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,164
Hold on. Your brother.

252
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,241
Dom.

253
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,921
Yeah, Mia, it's me.

254
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,001
<i>How's it going there?</i>

255
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,445
We're at Mando's.

256
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,931
This place is like a fortress.

257
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,209
You should see Brian.
He's in full FBI mode.

258
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,529
He built a surveillance hub in
Mandds garage and everything.

259
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,328
<i>What about you'? Did you
find out who's after us'?</i>

260
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,210
Looks like the sins of London
have followed us home.

261
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,884
<i>How did Buster take the news?</i>

262
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,365
I can't tell him.

263
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,442
If he knew about the baby,
he'd stay here with us.

264
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,603
<i>And with ail that's going on, youwe
gonna need him by your side.</i>

265
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,684
Just watch out for
him. Keep him safe.

266
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,801
And come home together.

267
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,766
Tell Brian
I'll see him in LA in two days.

268
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,127
Where are you going?

269
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,725
Tokyo.

270
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,242
I'm bringing Han home.

271
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,528
<i>Authorities are still
trying to determine</i>

272
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,206
<i>the motive behind this daring
attack here at the office</i>

273
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,762
<i>of the US Diplomatic Security
Service in downtown Les Angeies</i>

274
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,605
<i>less than 36 hours ago.</i>

275
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,761
<i>Facts are still coming in;</i>

276
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,002
<i>but what is known
is the suspect entered</i>

277
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,731
<i>the building's fourth floor...</i>

278
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,165
Hey.

279
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,643
You okay?
Yeah.

280
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:22,162
This guy's just relentless.

281
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,887
That's why Dom needs you.

282
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,964
You two need to find this guy
and you need to stop him

283
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,805
before he does any more
damage to our family.

284
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,209
You know, I just...

285
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,722
I've screwed up
so many things.

286
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,489
I couldn't live with myself
if I screw this up, too.

287
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,001
You won't.

288
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,169
I believe in you.

289
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,523
I believe in us.
That's all that matters.

290
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,569
I love you, Brian.

291
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,686
I love you, baby.

292
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:09,967
Just promise me,
after this, we're done.

293
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,964
No more jobs, no more enemies.

294
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,769
Come back to us.

295
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,683
I won't let you down, Mia.

296
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,526
I know.

297
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,486
Hes'. yo, Sean!

298
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,891
Hey, check this out, man.

299
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,128
This dude over here
want to race the new DK.

300
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,521
Not tonight, Twinkie.

301
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,326
Said he knew Han.

302
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,931
Han said you was <i>fast,</i>
but not that damn fast.

303
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,247
Who said American
muscle can't drift?

304
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:04,242
Han mentioned he left his
enemies in his rearview.

305
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,730
He never talked
about it much.

306
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,765
Always playing it
close to the vest.

307
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,809
We found a couple
things by the crash.

308
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,646
Wasn't much left.

309
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,846
Gisele.

310
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,410
Oh, yeah.

311
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,450
There's one more thing.

312
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,282
I found this.

313
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,486
Must have meant
something to him.

314
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,922
When you find the guy
that killed Han,

315
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,811
what are you going to do?

316
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,683
Words ain't even
been invented yet.

317
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,642
They say to live in the hearts
of those we leave behind

318
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,202
is not to die.

319
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,886
But he put you in this grave.

320
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,521
So now I'll do
the same to him.

321
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,686
I can't do no
more funerals.

322
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,281
First Han.

323
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,771
Now Hobbs is laid up,
of all people.

324
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,930
We're being hunted.

325
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,846
You know he's out there
somewhere watching, right'?

326
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,726
I hope so.

327
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,690
Means he's close.

328
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,208
Just promise me, Brian,

329
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,290
no more funerals.

330
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,926
Just one more.

331
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,967
His.

332
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,402
You never should have
messed with a man's family.

333
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,170
I told your brother
the same thing.

334
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,525
Reinforced your chassis.

335
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,602
Ifs like going into a ring
with weighted gloves.

336
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,647
Your mistake.

337
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,210
I'm not here to play games.

338
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,922
See, you and me, we're
from different worlds.

339
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,764
Trust me, I've seen a lot meaner
streets than the ones you're used to.

340
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,247
Stick around.

341
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,451
It's gonna get a lot meaner.

342
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,282
You thought this was
gonna be a street fight'?

343
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,885
On the ground.

344
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,441
Now!

345
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,205
Drop him
or I will drop you!

346
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,610
Whoa, whoa. Easy, guys.
We're on the same team here.

347
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,120
Mr. Toretto,

348
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,250
I'm here on the recommendation
of a mutual friend ofours.

349
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,084
Mr. Hobbs.
Who the hell are you'?

350
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,844
Me? I'm just a QUY-

351
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,724
I'm Mr. Nobody.

352
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,602
Ifs a big entrance
for a nobody.

353
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,442
And the guy that put our
mutual friend in the hospital?

354
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,601
You just let him get away.

355
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,447
I think I might havejustsaved
your ass there, Dom.

356
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,807
Listen, you think you could
let go of my guy there?

357
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,201
He's beginning to
turn a little blue.

358
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,284
I appreciate that.

359
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,605
Ah, here they come.

360
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,681
Listen, Dom.

361
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:30,721
There's a war going on between
shadows and ghosts like me.

362
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,124
You and your team unwittingly walked
into the middle of it in London,

363
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,567
and it appears it's
now followed you home.

364
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,850
It's up to you.

365
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,647
I'm gonna have a beer.

366
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,725
You're welcome to join me.

367
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,650
By the way, I can
get you Deckard Shaw.

368
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,845
Belgian ale.

369
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,291
0h, man, those
monks got it right.

370
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,283
I mean, I don't know about
the whole celibacy thing,

371
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,362
but when it
comes to beer...

372
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,281
Would you like one?

373
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,690
I'm more of a
Corona man myself.

374
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,841
Ah.

375
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:24,406
Your file's not
only detailed,

376
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:27,848
it's, uh,
extremely entertaining.

377
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:36,803
Look, Shaw's power
is that he's a shadow.

378
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,963
He's really good at getting in and
out of places without being seen

379
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,122
and leaving nothing but a
body count in his wake.

380
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,727
I mean, he's a legitimate
English badass.

381
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,723
But to be honest with you,
Dom, I don't give two shits

382
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,484
about Deckard Shaw.

383
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,925
It's you I want.

384
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,050
Because you and I can help each
other get what we both need.

385
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,691
I'm listening.

386
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,331
Just recently a
private military company

387
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,290
led by a wanted terrorist
named Mose Jakande

388
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,840
kidnapped a hacker known
only by the name "Ramsey."

389
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,041
Now, Lady Liberty's
got her panties

390
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,849
in a bunch over this,
but rightfully so,

391
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,810
because this Ramsey has created
something interesting.

392
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,765
- Bring it up.
- Yes, sir.

393
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,530
Say hello

394
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,091
to God's Eye.

395
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:20,005
Now, this little bastard hacks into
anything that's on the digital network.

396
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,766
That means every cell phone,
satellite, ATM machine and computer.

397
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,047
Simultaneously.

398
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,929
If it's got
a microphone or a lens,

399
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,729
God's Eye can
use it to find you.

400
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,167
So you invited me hereto
show me a tracking device.

401
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,368
On steroids. Lots of them.

402
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,010
Let me put it
to you this way.

403
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,686
It took us nearly a decade
to find Osama bin Laden.

404
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,127
With this, we'd have located
him anywhere on the planet

405
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,806
in a couple of hours.

406
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,360
Now, that's a serious
piece of machinery

407
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,408
that could be catastrophic
in the wrong hands.

408
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,888
But for some very nauseating
political reasons,

409
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,246
any rescue plans involving

410
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,210
any US government
forces or entity

411
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,248
has been strictly ruled out.

412
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,364
And that's why I need you.

413
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,122
But why do I need you?

414
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,448
I mean,
I could go back outside,

415
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,528
enjoy the rest
of the Coronas,

416
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,649
let Shaw come to me.

417
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,451
You could do that. How's that
working out for you so far?

418
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,567
You got one friend
in the ground,

419
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,880
another one in the hospital.

420
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,281
And then, of course, there's
that little issue of the bomb

421
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,488
that destroyed your home.

422
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,490
Shaw lives in a
world that doesn't

423
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,483
PIQY by your rules.

424
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,281
Like it or not,

425
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,761
you live in that
world now, too.

426
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,768
You wanna know
how to kill a shadow?

427
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,167
You just shine
a little light on it.

428
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,924
If you get the
God's Eye for me,

429
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,604
I've already got
authorization

430
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,921
for you to use it
until you get Shaw.

431
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,968
You go from the hunted
to the hunter.

432
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,361
And there's no place on Earth
Shaw can hide from you.

433
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,284
More importantly,

434
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:49,163
you and your family don't
go to any more funerals.

435
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,800
You get Ramsey,
you get the God's Eye,

436
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,201
you get Shaw.

437
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:58,086
Well, that's the wind-up
and the pitch.

438
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,481
Now that I've given you
this incredibly sensitive

439
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,961
and highly
classified information,

440
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,567
what do you think, Toretto?

441
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,043
I think you already know
what I'm gonna do.

442
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,640
Good.

443
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,531
But it'll be my way.

444
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,401
And my crew.

445
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,528
I assumed you
might say that.

446
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,327
Which is why I've taken the
liberty of gathering your team.

447
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,922
This is crazy.

448
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,845
What the hell is
going on in here'?

449
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,769
Our intelligence
suggests that Ramsey

450
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,649
will be transported
by an armed motorcade

451
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,484
through the Caucasus
mountain range.

452
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,688
If they clear this range
and reach their destination,

453
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,489
Ramsey is as good as gone.

454
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,686
So let me
get this straight.

455
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,331
There's only one road
that leads in or out,

456
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,448
sheer drops on every side,

457
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,171
a motorcade from hell
protected by a small army

458
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,765
from one mile in
either direction?

459
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,402
Yeah, that's about it.

460
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,571
You done?
No, I'm not done.

461
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,810
So you all wanted me
to break into

462
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,450
a police station. Fine.

463
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,610
Then you asked me
to stop a tank.

464
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,524
I wasn't happy about it,
but I did it.

465
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,762
Then you came up with
this brilliant idea

466
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:18,242
to shoot down one of the
largest airplanes ever.

467
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,931
I shot that shit
out of the sky. Mmm.

468
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,441
It's nothing.

469
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,805
But this right here,
my friend,

470
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,166
happens to be

471
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,608
the stupidest idea I've
ever heard of in my life.

472
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,808
I forgot that you were the only
one to bring the plane down.

473
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,008
No, no. The only thing I've
ever seen him take down was

474
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,241
"No Knees" Denise.

475
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,129
Remember, at prom?

476
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,248
Really, Brian? You're
gonna do that right here?

477
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,886
See, y'all trying to get me off my point.

478
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:45,089
All I'm saying is, I'm tired
of everybody around me

479
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,242
making all the decisions.

480
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,810
This time, I lead.

481
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,123
Seriously. If I don't start
making decisions, I'm out.

482
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,964
All right, Roman.

483
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,686
What do you got?

484
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:01,565
I mean, lwasn't trying to get into the
whole leadership thing, like, now.

485
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,005
You know what I'm saying?

486
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,208
I was just, kind of, talking
about, like, at some point.

487
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,406
Like, you know, when we...

488
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,369
Whatever. I mean, I think...

489
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,406
Let's hit it from here.

490
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,721
Idonfitmnk thatthafs.n
No,n0,no,don1thmk.

491
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,689
That's my job.

492
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,121
Okay.

493
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,088
It is impossible
to hit it there.

494
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,403
That is literally the most
secure spot on the mountain.

495
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,926
Why? Because you cannot
physically access it.

496
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,248
See, that's what
makes it so sweet.

497
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,926
Because it's the place that they
least expect us to hit them from.

498
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,650
As much as
I hate to admit it,

499
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,721
he's onto something there.

500
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,206
What do you think, Dom?

501
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,005
- Here?
- Yeah.

502
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,046
I think we got a plan.

503
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,930
Completely wrong thinking.

504
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,001
And I like ii.

505
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,842
You see? I'm good at this.

506
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,522
"Good"? Okay.

507
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,849
How are you planning
on getting on that road?

508
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,889
Well, Tej?

509
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,481
I think I may actually
have a plan for that.

510
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:09,728
What? I delegated.
That's what good leaders do.

511
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,041
Leader!

512
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,168
You know, when I was
reading your files,

513
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,481
I was impressed with what you've
accomplished with your team.

514
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:19,201
But meeting them now,
I've gotta say, Dom,

515
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,644
you've truly got a gift.

516
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:28,207
Consider my workshop
your new playhouse.

517
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:32,410
I think you'll find our
cars extremely appealing.

518
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,243
And your team
is now complete.

519
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,884
I went to the house.

520
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,762
I was looking
for you everywhere.

521
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,162
You scared the
shit out of me.

522
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,602
<i>You will never be alone.
Wherever you go...</i>

523
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,444
Tell <i>no</i> one.

524
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,889
Where did you find that?

525
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,086
Found in Han's car.

526
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,165
It was left as a message.

527
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,130
A message I plan
on returning.

528
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,686
Can you ride?

529
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,410
Yeah, of course I can.

530
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,767
Han was my family, too.

531
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,165
Brian!

532
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,402
We're gonna need
long-travel suspension,

533
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,528
limited-slip differentials
on all of them.

534
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,806
How you doing'?

535
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,527
<i>Gom; w es'-!</i>

love child between that

537
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,450
and that.

538
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,965
That's a lot of armor.

539
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,610
It's just gonna
add more weight.

540
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,091
Slow you down.

541
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,440
This time, it ain't
just about being fast.

542
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,205
Yeah, I'm good.

543
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,448
From the streets. You know
what I'm saying?

544
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,207
It's nothing.

545
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,527
Hey, Roman, you're
freaking out, ain't you?

546
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,051
No.
Yeah, you are.

547
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,447
I said no.

548
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,043
Listen, man, it takes a grown
man to embrace his feelings.

549
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,687
<i>If you need to cry,
just go ahead and cry.</i>

550
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,251
As your friend, you know I'm
concerned about your well-being,

551
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,691
<i>which is why I took
the precaution</i>

552
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,605
of putting some adult diapers
in your glove compartment.

553
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,841
Yo, can you just
chill out, man?

554
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,449
<i>I have seen
some crazy shit, Dom,</i>

555
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,204
but this really
could make some waves.

556
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:39,967
So Iefsjust try to keep it
as low-key as possible, huh?

557
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,241
Don't I always?

558
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:44,927
<i>H! tell you what, you knock it
down a couple of notches this fime</i>

559
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,970
and I'll swap out my Belgian
for a keg of Corona.

560
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,522
You'd be doing
yourself a favor, there.

561
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,481
Can somebody just walk me through
what we're supposed to be doing?

562
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:56,006
Come on, Rom, this is your plan.
You gotta embrace it.

563
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,491
No, this was not my plan.

564
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,686
0h, yeah, here we go.
Game time.

565
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,249
<i>TEA". (OVER RADM Roman,
you need some fresh air'?</i>

566
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,084
Because you're about to
get a whole lot of it.

567
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,728
Okay, here we go!

568
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,925
Just when you didn't think
it could get any better, huh?

569
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,450
Oh, shit!

570
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,081
<i>Whom!</i>

571
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,001
Now we're moving.

572
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,443
Everybody good?
Everybody make it out'?

573
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,322
You just didn't tell them
that this is not for you!

574
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,731
This is not your mission!

575
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,121
Hey, Rom? Hey, what's up, man?
Talk to me, come on!

576
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,889
- I can't <i>do it.
- The hell you can't!</i>

577
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,450
Come on, man!
You throw that thing

578
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,170
in reverse and get
your ass out here now!

579
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,567
Look, I can't do it, okay?
Listen to what I'm saying.

580
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,721
Now isn't the time!

581
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,165
<i>Fma stay up here
with the pilot.</i>

582

from up here!

584
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,840
You're running
out of time!

585
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:48,168
The chute is guided by GPS!

586
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,409
<i>You don't have
to do anything!</i>

587
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,130
Tej!
I'm already on it.

588
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,091
Hey, man, listen.

00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,605
I'm sorry to
let y'all down, okay'?

<i>TEA; No, brother.</i>

I'm sorry to let you down. What?

593
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:02,841
What do you mean you're...

594
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,202
Tej! What are you doing?

00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,849
Oh, shit!

Tej !

597
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,684
I hate you, Tej!

598
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:24,887
Get ready!

599
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,366
Ground's coming fast!

600
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,202
Come on, baby. Come on.

00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:31,840
Car check. Call it in.

604
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,001
Check.
Check.

605
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,127
I'm good. Let's do this.

606
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:40,447
Hello? Please, man.
Get me out of here, somebody!

607

No! The trees!

00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:43,727
Oh, shit.

609
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,370
Sit tight, Roman.
We'll come back for you.

610
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,930
This is not the plan!

611
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:09,210
All right, you got one chance
to hit them here, Dom.

612
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:11,324
You miss, they'll make
it to their black site

613
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,721
and they'll squeeze whatever
information they need out of Ramsey.

614
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:16,724
<i>The device and your chance of ever
getting Shaw will be gone for good.</i>

That ain't gonna happen.

616
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:20,011
I'll see you at the pickup.

617
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,280
Ramsey will be in the bus.

618
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,521
Then let's do this.

619
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,968
Captain, we have company.
Four cars, inbound.

620

Armor-piercing rounds!

632
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,041
Hook them up.

unidentified vehicle approaching.

645
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:57,731
Come on! Closer!

646
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:59,245
- You're gonna have to jump.
- No! No! NO!

647
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:00,321
We don't have time!
Come on!

648
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:03,129
We gotta get out of here.
Come on.

649
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,770
Look at me! Look at me!
I'm notjumping!

650
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:07,571
You don't jump,
we're gonna die. Okay?

651
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:09,401
You'rejumping. Come on!

652
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:10,720
One.

653
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,131
Two!

654
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:21,970
Well, well, well.

655
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,326
Take my hand!

656
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:47,731
Welcome to the
party, Mr. Shaw.

657
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:38,649
<i>Letty, stay with Brian.</i>

658
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:03,921
Oh, shit!

659
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:10,282
What are you doing?
This is crazy!

660
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:11,600
Keeping you alive.

661
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,922
There's a cliff. Cliff!

662
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:00,646
Cliff! There's a cliff!

663
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:38,481
Shit!

664
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,401
Too slow.

665
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:18,369
Yeah!

666
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:21,926
I'm back, bitches!

667
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,001
<i>Mam</i>

668
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:55,081
You good?

669
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,365
Thank you.

670
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,763
Roman, get back to the others.
What about you?

671
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,251
Don't worry about me.

672
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:17,926
I have to say,
I am impressed.

673
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:22,208
I would very much like to
know the name of the man

674
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:24,726
who is causing me
so much trouble.

675
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:28,161
There's no way out of there.

676
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:29,401
What is he doing?

677
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:31,369
He's frozen like a damn
deer in headlights.

678
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:33,204
MR. NOBODY;
Toretto ain't no deer.

679
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:35,045
Come on, Dominic.

680
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:38,329
Give us the girl,
and I'll let you live.

681
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:40,524
What are you going to do?

682
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:45,444
You might wanna put on
your helmet for this one.

683
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:49,041
Helm...

684
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:55,481
Target the driver.

685
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:04,409
Damn it!
What is he thinking'?

686
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:07,325
You're insane!

687
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:17,522
You're pointing
the wrong way.

688
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:18,761
Am I now?

689
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:27,451
Fire on my mark.

690
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:30,049
Interesting.
Three!

691
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:33,408
Two!
Hold on.

692
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:34,641
One!

693
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:36,926
Fire!

694
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:34,127
Looks like our
demon love child worked.

695
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:35,964
That's one way
down a mountain.

696
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:38,211
Where's Ramsey?

697
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:53,570
Hello Kitty is awake.

698
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:59,088
She don't look like
a hacker to me.

699
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:01,561
0h, yeah? And what do
hackers look like?

700
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:03,608
They don't supposed
to look like that.

701
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:06,320
I'm just saying, like,

702
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:08,004
you know how they
normally wear them little,

703
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:09,923
weird glasses
that's all crooked,

704
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:12,487
and pimples all over their
face from drinking soda?

705
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:15,684
I mean, trust me,
with a body like that,

706
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:17,569
you ain't gonna park it
behind a computer.

707
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:20,040
How are you feeling?

708
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:21,610
Did you hit your head'?

709
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:26,006
Feeling nauseous?
Ears ringing? No'?

710
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:28,004
Where's my shoe?

711
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:29,610
Oh' it flew off
when you crashed.

712
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:33,403
If you start experiencing any of
those things, let me know, okay?

713
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:35,926
I don't know whether to
thank you for rescuing me

714
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,162
or kick your ass forthrowing
me off a cliff.

715
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,002
Thank us or kick
our ass, huh?

716
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,521
How about you tell us
where that device is?

717
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:49,482
I mailed it to a friend.

718
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:50,681
In Abu Dhabi.

719
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:53,050
That was pretty easy.

720
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:56,001
That other team would have
tortured you for that information.

721
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:59,129
I didn't trust them.
I trust you.

722
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:03,602
Now, why would you trust us?
You barely know us.

723
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:05,325
I know enough.

724
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:10,124
Ex-cop. Military,
something like that.

725
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:13,490
The way you took out
them guys shows training.

726
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:17,526
Tech guy, offended by the
hacker remark, naturally.

727
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:19,685
Alpha.

728
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:22,130
Mrs. Alpha.

729
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:24,841
Joken

730
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:26,321
Wrong.

731
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:29,883
Double alpha.

732
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:32,122
Man candy. You know
what I'm saying?

733
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:33,361
Man, sit your
candy ass down.

734
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:38,002
The disrespect is
real around here.

735
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:40,529
Life is binary.
Zeroes and ones.

736
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:42,762
Only two things keep a
group like this together.

737
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:44,569
Fear or loyalty.

738
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,651
And I don't see a drop
of fear among you guys.

739
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:50,246
Very impressive.
Just one thing.

740
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:51,447
They're not married.

741
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:53,727
She's so off, it's crazy.
You just gonna roll with it?

742
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:56,526
You're telling me there can't
be a double alpha in one group?

743
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:57,681
You work for US government'?

744
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:01,724
We got similar interests.

745
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:07,482
Tej, call it in.

746
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:09,922
We're going
to the Middle East!

747
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:19,201
BRIANI Hey.

748
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:33,486
Hey, Dom. It was pretty
wild on that mountain, huh?

749
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:35,529
No, it was too close.

750
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:37,326
But we got the job done.

751
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:41,682
You know what
the crazy thing is, is...

752
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:44,491
You miss the bullets.

753
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:48,082
Yeah, that's messed up, huh?

754
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:51,004
Brian, I've seen you jump
from trains, dive from planes.

755
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:54,328
Hell, I saw your courage
the day I met you.

756
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:55,886
Right.

757
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:59,131
Wantto know the bravest
thing I ever saw you do?

758
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:01,885
Be a good man to Mia.

759
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:06,764
Being a great father
to my nephew, Jack.

760
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:09,529
Everyone's looking
for the thrill,

761
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:13,400
but what's real is family.

762
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:15,725
Your family.

763
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:17,964
Hold on to that, Brian.

764
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:25,284
It's hotter than I
thought it would be.

765
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:28,370
Yeah, well, we are in the
desert, so it would be hot.

766
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:29,885
0h, no, lain't talking
about the weather.

767
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:37,245
My, my, my.
Hmm.

768
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:47,125
Now, that is a woman

769
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:49,601
that's worth falling
out a plane for.

770
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:51,330
Get out of there, man,
I got dibs on that.

771
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:52,401
You've seen me
looking at that.

772
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:54,164
Did you just say "dibs"?

773
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:55,366
What are you, in
the fourth grade?

774
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:57,010
Man, can you
just get out of there?

775
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:58,206
I mean,
it's a free market.

776
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:00,726
What are you talking about?
Get out of there.

777
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:02,290
Rock, paper,
scissors for her.

778
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:04,930
Are you guys for
real right now'?

779
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:06,726
Look at you.

780
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:08,571
You both look
whupped already.

781
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:09,766
You got stalker eyes.

782
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:13,209
I tried to call dibs
on Ramsey two years ago.

783
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:14,721
Her knee, my balls.

784
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:17,248
Trust me,
you don't wanna do that.

785
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:20,641
Hey! Ramsey!

786
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:23,645
Hello, Safar.

787
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:27,450
I see you make
some new friends.

788
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:29,522
Yeah, some short-tempered
new friends.

789
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:32,285
I need the speed drive
I sentyou. Where is it'?

790
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:35,125
0h, good. You will be
pleased to know I sold it.

791
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,486
You sold it?

792
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:37,766
You hear that?

793
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:39,171
I asked you to
take care of it.

794
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:40,605
Why on earth
would you sell it'?

795
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:42,207
We're gonna need it back.

796
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:44,361
Impossible.

797
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:47,803
Safar, I stashed something inside it.
It's important.

798
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:49,450
Okay, okay.

799
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:51,727
Uh, good news. It is safe.

800
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:53,885
And the bad news?

801
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:56,602
It is very safe.

802
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:59,729
I sold it to a Jordanian
prince living up there.

803
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:01,131
Trust fund billionaire.

804
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:03,771
Said he wanted to use
it for his supercar.

805
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:05,327
Now, see, this?

806
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:07,050
This' I like.

807
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:08,531
Billionaire, supercar...

808
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:10,364
What makes it so super?

809
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:13,011
242 miles per hour,
top speed.

810
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:16,050
And it's bulletproof.

811
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:17,531
242...

812
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:20,441
Am I the only one
aroused right now?

813
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:22,488
It's, like, you know
what I'm saying?

814
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:25,207
Whatever.

815
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:26,964
Where does he keep it?

816
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:28,881
In his penthouse.

817
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:30,530
Tower number one.

818
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:33,801
Now, why in the hell would he
keep his car in his penthouse?

819
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:35,041
He's a billionaire,
my friend.

820
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:37,407
He can do whatever he wants.

821
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:40,211
Now, tomorrow happens to be
the longest day of the year.

822
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:41,406
The prince wants
to celebrate it

823
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:43,369
and host a party
tomorrow afternoon.

824
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:44,771
So you can get us
up there, right'?

825
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:46,171
Sure.

826
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:49,130
But, uh,
not dressed like that.

827
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:19,801
What?

828
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:21,650
Is something wrong?

829
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:22,960
There's a billion
things wrong.

830
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:26,564
But not in this moment.

831
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:28,610
You look handsome.

832
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:30,731
I feel awkward.

833
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:33,964
You and me both.

834
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:35,769
Just seeing you
dressed like this

835
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:38,361
just reminds me
of something.

836
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:40,166
Of what?

837
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:44,361
Old times.

838
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:58,400
YOU Okay?

839
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,764
Yeah. I'm fine.

840
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:03,401
Showtime.

841
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:39,690
No, no, no. Listen, man.

842
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:41,842
They're telling me they
party like this every day.

843
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:43,684
On this level,
they party every day.

844
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:45,444
This is crazy. I might
have to move out here.

845
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:48,924
I think I'm gonna start a new culture.
It's called Blarab.

846
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,411
You know,
like "black Arab."

847
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:51,925
How are we looking, Tej?

848
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:53,121
We're almost in position.

849
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:55,169
Okay, so this is
how it works.

850
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:57,288
<i>We got to move in sync
if we're gonna pull this off.</i>

851
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:58,691
<i>So let's go over
it to make sure</i>

852
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:00,888
<i>everyone clearly
understands their roles.</i>

853
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:02,564
Roman, that means you.

854
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:05,166
You know what, you're being real
unprofessional right now, Tej.

855
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:07,163
The God's Eye chip
is hidden in a speed drive

856
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:08,321
installed in
the prince's car,

857
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:10,129
which he keeps in
a safe room vault.

858
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:12,123
I make 8 to 10
plainclothes security.

859
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:14,487
Not to mention the prince

860
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:16,963
and his personal bodyguards.

861
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:19,805
Security cameras are clustered by the
north wall. That's where the vault is.

862
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:22,770
We got to get in that vault, we got
to tap into the security system,

863
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:24,569
<i>which can be accessed
in the prince's bedroom.</i>

864
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:25,721
All right, guys,
I'm going in.

865
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:30,046
Excuse me.

866
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:32,811
Oh, I was just
looking for the...

867
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:34,610
The party is that way.
What?

868
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:35,966
This room is off-limits.

869
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:43,247
<i>TEA; Now,
once weWe tapped in,</i>

870
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:45,766
<i>Ramsey and 1 can hack into
the network and pop the door</i>

871
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:47,285
<i>so you can get in
and get that shit.</i>

872
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:49,010
<i>Wait, wait, wait.
You missed</i> a <i>step.</i>

873
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:51,242
What about my steps? What
am I supposed to be doing?

874
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:52,845
No, we didn't miss anything.

875
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:55,048
<i>You're special teams.
So when we need you,</i>

876
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:56,360
do what you do best.

877
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:57,766
And that is?

878
01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:02,684
Shine brightly like only
Roman Pearce can do.

879
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:03,761
Ha-ha.

880
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,843
See? Now we talking.

881
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:07,331
All right, Tej, I'm in.

882
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:08,447
All right,
find the phonejack.

883
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:09,885
The tap always
runs behind that.

884
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:13,089
It's gonna be a
350-megahertz CAT5e cable.

885
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:15,162
<i>They probably got
a couple dozen back there,</i>

886
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:17,049
but this will be the bonded
pair with the plenum coat.

887
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:18,601
English, Tej.

888
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:19,806
It'll be the orange wire.

889
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:23,441
All right,
ladies and gentlemen,

890
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:25,249
we are in the pilot seat.

891
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:30,884
<i>All right, Roman.</i>

892
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:32,883
Do whatever it is you do.

893
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:35,888
It's your birthday, right?

894
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:37,291
Are you Jasmine?

895
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:39,647
- Oh, God, no. Not the birthday routine.
<i>- Take</i> my <i>hand.</i>

896
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:42,166
Happy birthday to you.
This way, this way.

897
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:44,322
Excuse me, so sorry.
I'm coming through, sorry.

898
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:46,880
Right this way. Listen,
excuse me one second.

899
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:49,767
My brother, my brother.
Man, you ain't supposed to...

900
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:51,365
Sir, thank you so much.

901
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:54,649
All right, listen, people. Please,
everybody, gather around.

902
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:56,609
Understand something,
right now.

903
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:58,091
Listen to what
I'm telling y'all.

904
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:02,645
We are here to celebrate
Jasmines 18th birthday.

905
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:04,643
HaPP? birthday', my dear.

906
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:09,409
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

907
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:12,244
<i>To you</i>

908
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:14,968
<i>To you</i>

909
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:17,926
0h, I wish I didn't see that.

910
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:23,330
Ramsey,
open it up for us.

911
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:25,442
Copy that. You're in.

912
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:41,000
Do you realize
what this is?

913
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:43,724
LYKHH HyperSport.

914
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:44,961
$3.4 million.

915
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:47,202
Zero-to-SO in less
than three seconds.

916
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:48,884
There's seven of these
things in the world,

917
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:50,485
and this guy keeps it
locked up in a vault.

918
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:54,531
Nnthing's sadder than
locking a beast in a cage.

919
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:57,008
And nowl really want
to punch him in the face.

920
01:12:57,280 --> 01:12:58,441
Okay.

921
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:00,601
Let's get to work.

922
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:09,407
You got this, right?

923
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:10,641
Go.

924
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:31,767
Would you believe I knocked
him out with my charm?

925
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,162
You ain't
thatcharming, bitch.

926
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:47,924
<i>No, no, m.!</i>

927
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,082
Tej, your magic trick is failing.
We're losing systems.

928
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:51,127
I know.

929
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:53,647
I see ii.

930
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:54,960
Tej, talk to me.

931
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:57,520
I'm trying, but their security
system is locking <i>us</i> out.

932
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,125
All right, listen,
ladies and gentlemen...

933
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:01,408
Oh, there he is.
These are your dancers?

934
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:02,686
This is a party, baby!

935
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:09,162
Some of y'all probably
went to the bathroom

936
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:11,322
and noticed that all
the hairspray was missing.

937
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:13,050
Yep. She did it.

938
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,001
Thank you.

939
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:22,690
And we're so happy
for you to be here.

940
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:25,684
You look like you got some missiles
underneath that dress. No?

941
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:28,161
He did not just...
Did you just say that?

942
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:42,250
0h, shit! Not the gate!
Not the gate!

943
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:46,609
Brian, faster!

944
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:48,091
<i>We're playing all
the defense we can up here</i>

945
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:50,242
but we're gonna lose.
You gotta hurry up.

946
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:55,083
Thank God you showed up.

947
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:58,969
These parties
bore me to death.

948
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:42,607
Aah!

949
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:53,090
Guys, get out of
there right now.

950
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:55,005
You've got an army
heading your way.

951
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:56,924
Brian, get out! Forget it!

952
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:00,040
Tej, we're taking the car.

953
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:05,320
This is what I do. You know what
I'm saying'? As far as I'm...

954
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:07,166
My man, what's...

955
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:14,926
<i>ROMAN'. Lem'?</i>

956
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,843
Letty, talk to me.
Are you okay?

957
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:19,284
<i>TEA". Guys, I cam hold it.
I'm losing the final gate.</i>

958
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:20,441
You gotta get out of there.

959
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:24,323
Tear out the dash! Go through it.

960
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:31,524
Wait, wait, wait. Now,
just hold on, man.

961
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:45,524
Time to unleash the beast.

962
01:16:57,720 --> 01:16:59,245
{ENGINE REVVING)

963
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:07,921
Let's go!

964
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:12,646
Stay with me,
I got you.

965
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:14,761
Let's get the hell
out of here.

966
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:56,880
Dom, cars don't fly!

967
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,525
Cars don't fly!

968
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:01,681
Holy shit!

969
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:32,729
No brakes!
What?

970
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:35,964
No brakes!
Shit!

971
01:18:51,240 --> 01:18:52,730
<i>No, no, m.!</i>

972
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:54,245
No!

973
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:07,841
Oh!

974
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:33,531
Got it!
Get out!

975
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:14,286
Still miss
the bullets, Brian?

976
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:57,251
- Ah! There they are. Disaster.
- I'm sorry.

977
01:20:57,400 --> 01:21:01,450
I get you an invite to the most
exclusive party in Abu Dhabi.

978
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:02,647
Safar...
No, no, no.

979
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:07,009
You steal the host's car, and you
jump it between two buildings.

980
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:08,810
Actually, it was three buildings.
Oh!

981
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:11,122
Two, insult. Three, honor.

982
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:12,281
My bad.

983
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:13,970
Well, well, well.

984
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:15,326
I have to say,

985
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:20,361
you've got an interesting interpretation
there of "low-key," Mr. Toretto.

986
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:24,169
You know, Dom, I thought
we had an understanding.

987
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:26,928
Sometimes you have to play
the hand you're dealt.

988
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:29,447
That's why I prefer
to be the dealer.

989
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:31,481
Good night.

990
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:36,401
Ah!

991
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:40,769
I'm being kicked out of my own garage.
This is great.

992
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,001
Uh, may I'?

993
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:46,360
Brian,

994
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:48,646
give it to him.

995
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:08,247
All that trouble
for this little

996
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:10,167
thing.

997
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:12,165
With all due respect, Dom,

998
01:22:12,440 --> 01:22:14,169
you really did
great work back there.

999
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:15,566
All of you.

1000
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:17,643
All of my men
are now standing by

1001
01:22:17,720 --> 01:22:20,724
and are fully
at your disposal.

1002
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:27,091
Your call.

1003
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:29,721
Ramsey.

1004
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:36,888
Fire it up and
find me Shaw.

1005
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:43,644
Oh, damn, this is crazy.

1006
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:45,647
Thank you.

1007
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:49,206
All right,
give me a second.

1008
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:53,641
What is it doing now?

1009
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:55,245
It's hunting.

1010
01:22:55,960 --> 01:22:57,769
Hacking into the security
cameras at Etihad Towers.

1011
01:22:58,280 --> 01:23:00,282
That's the last place you saw Shaw,
so that's where we'll start.

1012
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:04,524
That's him, right there.

1013
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:06,766
Wait, wait. What are these
numbers right here for?

1014
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:09,044
It's bio-mapping Shaw's face.

1015
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:14,566
It'll run it
against every camera.

1016
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:18,289
<i>Every audio device
in this hemisphere.</i>

1017
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:33,486
Bingo. Looks like
he's holed up here.

1018
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:35,201
<i>That's perfect.</i>

1019
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:37,687
Automated factory, no people,
lots of places to hide.

1020
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:40,207
You just changed the face
of manhunts forever.

1021
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:43,524
Congratulations.

1022
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:47,686
Hey, can I check
my email real quick'?

1023
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:49,842
Dawn's up in two hours.

1024
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:54,527
We're gonna go
take down Shaw then.

1025
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:56,849
Go get changed.

1026
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:02,530
We should go now.

1027
01:24:03,320 --> 01:24:06,369
Just you, your team, and me.

1028
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:07,921
I thought you said at dawn.

1029
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,081
My guys are racers,

1030
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:10,844
the best drivers
in the world.

1031
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:12,490
But they ain't killers.

1032
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:14,244
Told you
he'd say that.

1033
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:16,522
I know you too well, Dom,
and I'm going with you.

1034
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:19,444
Well, looks like we got
a nice little hunting party.

1035
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:21,969
Let's go bag a shadow.

1036
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:31,848
Ten klicks out, boys.
Get ready to rock and roll.

1037
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:40,009
Here we go. Weapons hot.

1038
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:03,564
You ready for this?
Yeah.

1039
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:35,724
I hope you're enjoying
your last meal.

1040
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:44,441
This is it?

1041
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:46,604
This is all I warrant?

1042
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:49,209
A dozen men?

1043
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:51,521
I think you'll find
it's more than enough.

1044
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:07,482
I'm ready
to meet my maker.

1045
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:08,966
Are you'?

1046
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:12,362
What were you expecting, Torettc?
To catch me off guard?

1047
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:15,329
Me standing here,
waving a white flag'?

1048
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,411
You ever heard the saying,

1049
01:26:17,560 --> 01:26:19,005
"The enemy of my enemy

1050
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:20,880
"is my friend"?

1051
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:23,802
I don't have friends.

1052
01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:25,246
I got family.

1053
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:28,926
Well, I got a lot of friends.

1054
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:45,088
Two-two formation!
Sheppard, peel one!

1055
01:26:45,240 --> 01:26:46,287
Roger that.

1056
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:48,086
Brian, leave it!

1057
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:01,961
Get down!

1058
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:15,041
I 901 you.

1059
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:39,844
JAKANDE; God's Eye.

1060
01:28:59,080 --> 01:29:01,924
You didn't really think I was gonna
walk in there naked, did you?

1061
01:29:04,160 --> 01:29:05,924
You got hit bad.

1062
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:08,050
Look, Toretto.

1063
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:11,007
I know you won't listen to me.

1064
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:14,331
You're not gonna want to
hear what I have to say.

1065
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:16,721
But the truth is,

1066
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:18,530
you really ought to

1067
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:21,566
try that Belgian ale, man.

1068
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:23,722
It's something special.

1069
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:25,729
Belgian ale, huh?

1070
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:29,808
Hey, we gotta
get you to a hospital.

1071
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:31,200
No, you're not.

1072
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:34,484
I carry my own
health insurance.

1073
01:29:35,160 --> 01:29:39,245
SOCM medics on standby.
They're already inbound.

1074
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:42,164
Pull over, kid.

1075
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:58,403
Dom,
you gotta protect Ramsey.

1076
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:00,403
As long as she's alive,

1077
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:03,521
she can lock them out of God's
Eye, and they know that.

1078
01:30:03,680 --> 01:30:06,889
That means they're not gonna stop
coming until they've got her.

1079
01:30:07,240 --> 01:30:08,890
And this time,
when they come

1080
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:11,884
they're gonna come
with everything they've got.

1081
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:13,241
I'm not leaving you.

1082
01:30:13,320 --> 01:30:14,446
You're not.

1083
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:16,888
I'm leaving you.

1084
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:20,963
Go now, Dom.

1085
01:30:34,680 --> 01:30:37,001
A war is coming to us,
whether we like it or not.

1086
01:30:38,360 --> 01:30:40,567
If a war is coming,

1087
01:30:42,440 --> 01:30:45,762
we're gonna face them on
the streets we know best.

1088
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:53,804
I'm all for winging it,
but this is crazy, man.

1089
01:30:53,960 --> 01:30:57,089
We got mercenaries with
some real heat on us.

1090
01:30:57,520 --> 01:30:58,851
I mean, I ain't scared
or nothing, but...

1091
01:30:59,720 --> 01:31:01,006
Man, I don't
even have a gun!

1092
01:31:02,680 --> 01:31:03,920
Gun?

1093
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:06,770
We got a whole city.

1094
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:09,241
And we may have more than that.
If they use God's Eye,

1095
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:11,727
it'll tap the cameras around
town to find our location.

1096
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:14,401
Which means we could
plant a virus.

1097
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:16,722
And then break in
when they access it.

1098
01:31:17,240 --> 01:31:19,607
So you're talking about
hacking my hacking device.

1099
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:20,966
It's brilliant.

1100
01:31:21,160 --> 01:31:22,730
Yeah, but there's
one problem.

1101
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:24,086
The signal strength.

1102
01:31:24,240 --> 01:31:27,483
We can't start a hack on them until
they're within a two-mile range.

1103
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,684
- That's really close.
- Close?

1104
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:30,921
These guys are military.

1105
01:31:31,080 --> 01:31:33,447
If they're within two miles
of us, we're already dead.

1106
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:38,049
I don't know about y'all, but I
didn't really plan on dying today.

1107
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:40,168
Only one way
to stay alive.

1108
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:43,486
We play keep-away with Ramsey.
What?

1109
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:44,931
They can't hit
us if we keep moving.

1110
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:46,923
DOM; And I'll take Shaw.

1111
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:48,565
So, basically,
we're just gearing up

1112
01:31:48,640 --> 01:31:49,926
for a big game of
hot potato, huh?

1113
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:51,161
Which car
is the potato?

1114
01:31:51,240 --> 01:31:52,241
Girl,
you're the potato.

1115
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:55,280
Why does it feel like
I'm not gonna see you again?

1116
01:32:08,840 --> 01:32:10,649
I'll come back for that.

1117
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:13,200
Promise?

1118
01:32:15,560 --> 01:32:16,925
Promise.

1119
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:38,608
- Brian, are you okay?
- Mia, listen <i>to</i> me.

1120
01:32:39,720 --> 01:32:41,563
Somethings about to go down.

1121
01:32:41,640 --> 01:32:43,847
<i>And if you don't hear
from me in 24 hows,</i>

1122
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:49,131
I need you to take
Jack and move on.

1123
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:52,771
You understand?

1124
01:32:54,200 --> 01:32:55,406
<i>You understand
what I'm saying'?</i>

1125
01:32:55,480 --> 01:32:57,369
No, I can't do that, Brian.

1126
01:32:57,600 --> 01:32:59,284
<i>No, I can't.</i>

1127
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:02,767
We're gonna have
another baby.

1128
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:04,691
It's a little girl.

1129
01:33:07,640 --> 01:33:08,926
<i>And she's going to
need her father.</i>

1130
01:33:09,080 --> 01:33:11,287
So you have to finish
what you're doing

1131
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:13,840
<i>and you have to
come home to her.</i>

1132
01:33:14,440 --> 01:33:15,771
You have to
come home to us.

1133
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:19,841
<i>Fm sorry 1 didn't
tell you before.</i>

1134
01:33:20,360 --> 01:33:24,081
I was scared you'd be
disappointed with domestic life.

1135
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:29,846
You know, the best decision I ever
made was stepping into the store

1136
01:33:30,680 --> 01:33:32,091
and buying that
first sandwich.

1137
01:33:34,640 --> 01:33:36,847
Itwas such a bad sandwich.

1138
01:33:38,120 --> 01:33:39,724
I know, right?
But I ate a lot of them.

1139
01:33:42,720 --> 01:33:43,721
Uh...

1140
01:33:49,720 --> 01:33:51,324
I love you, Mia.

1141
01:33:54,280 --> 01:33:55,281
Don't do that.

1142
01:33:55,560 --> 01:33:56,686
What?

1143
01:33:56,840 --> 01:33:57,841
<i>The way you said it.</i>

1144
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,729
It's like goodbye.
Say something else.

1145
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:03,369
Okay. Kiss Jack for me.

1146
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:07,000
I will.

1147
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:15,489
I love you, Brian.

1148
01:34:18,840 --> 01:34:20,285
I love you, Mia.

1149
01:34:52,080 --> 01:34:53,320
One last ride.

1150
01:36:02,040 --> 01:36:03,963
Boot up God's Eye.
Find them.

1151
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:19,001
I'm getting something.

1152
01:36:23,080 --> 01:36:24,650
I got a positive ID.
It's Toretto.

1153
01:36:26,200 --> 01:36:28,168
God's Eye is placing him
at Hill and Seventh.

1154
01:36:32,440 --> 01:36:33,646
Should we follow him'?

1155
01:36:33,800 --> 01:36:35,689
No. Let Shaw
take care of him.

1156
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:36,887
Find Ramsey.

1157
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:37,961
Yes, sir.

1158
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:47,167
I don't know why we gotta
keep driving around like this.

1159
01:36:47,280 --> 01:36:48,884
Why can't we just
pull over somewhere,

1160
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:51,611
park, gather our thoughts in,
like, a bunker somewhere?

1161
01:36:51,680 --> 01:36:53,284
Because it does not
work like that.

1162
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:55,329
We gotta stick close
enough to the bad guys

1163
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:57,528
in orderto get in range
for Ramsey to hack them.

1164
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:00,444
But we gotta be mobile enough not
to get shot like fish in a barrel.

1165
01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:02,010
So, do me a favor,
focus on the mission

1166
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:03,491
and keep us from
getting killed.

1167
01:37:05,200 --> 01:37:07,009
Got her. Target acquired.

1168
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:08,969
She's riding shotgun
in a blue GT-R.

1169
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:18,281
Guys, they're here.

1170
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:19,801
How many cars'?

1171
01:37:19,880 --> 01:37:20,927
Uh, none.

1172
01:37:21,120 --> 01:37:22,724
<i>And that's kind
of the problem.</i>

1173
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:31,649
Okay, let's give
them the tour.

1174
01:37:31,720 --> 01:37:32,846
Break on my mark.

1175
01:37:32,920 --> 01:37:35,002
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

1176
01:37:35,080 --> 01:37:36,241
Go!

1177
01:37:40,120 --> 01:37:41,485
Splitting up won't work.

1178
01:37:41,640 --> 01:37:43,324
Can't hide from God's Eye.

1179
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:48,281
They're in range.

1180
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:50,045
Ramsey, start the hack.

1181
01:37:50,200 --> 01:37:51,531
Initiating.

1182
01:37:52,440 --> 01:37:53,441
Now.

1183
01:37:55,800 --> 01:37:57,962
Sir, I think someone's
trying to hack the system.

1184
01:37:58,720 --> 01:37:59,881
It's Ramsey.

1185
01:38:00,040 --> 01:38:01,246
Send in the Predator!

1186
01:38:01,400 --> 01:38:02,561
Take her out!

1187
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:04,489
Releasing Predator.

1188
01:38:36,120 --> 01:38:37,326
I think we lost the chopper.

1189
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:45,328
I think we got
bigger problems than that!

1190
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:48,645
Oh, my God.

1191
01:38:50,760 --> 01:38:51,761
What are you doing?

1192
01:38:51,920 --> 01:38:52,967
We're going old school!

1193
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:00,681
Watch out!

1194
01:40:15,120 --> 01:40:16,167
It's coming
back around!

1195
01:40:29,080 --> 01:40:30,206
Predatofls back on him.

1196
01:40:30,520 --> 01:40:32,284
- Ready missiles!
- Roger that.

1197
01:40:34,120 --> 01:40:35,360
Fire!

1198
01:40:36,440 --> 01:40:37,441
Oh, shit!

1199
01:40:47,240 --> 01:40:48,765
Football's hot!
I need to lateral!

1200
01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:50,046
Rom, where are you?

1201
01:40:50,120 --> 01:40:51,485
Running back charging in!

1202
01:41:10,040 --> 01:41:12,407
Meet me on Third and Spring.
You got it!

1203
01:41:19,560 --> 01:41:20,721
I'm halfway there.

1204
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:22,006
Grab your computer!
Get in the window!

1205
01:41:22,160 --> 01:41:23,286
Why?
Do m Now!

1206
01:41:28,680 --> 01:41:30,011
You gotta go! Right now!

1207
01:41:34,440 --> 01:41:35,851
Fire!

1208
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:47,481
Come on!

1209
01:42:06,280 --> 01:42:07,725
Hit!

1210
01:42:11,120 --> 01:42:12,281
He made it!

1211
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:14,130
I can't believe
we pulled that off.

1212
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:23,443
Wait, wait, wait. We're
still being hacked. What?

1213
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:25,363
God's Eye is
still tracking Ramsey.

1214
01:42:25,440 --> 01:42:26,930
Keep the drone
in pursuit of her.

1215
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:28,570
The signal has to be
coming from somewhere.

1216
01:43:05,720 --> 01:43:08,405
<i>Back to throw. Here
comes the blitz. Number 94 sacks him!</i>

1217
01:43:08,480 --> 01:43:10,847
<i>Breaking news
out of Los Angeles tonight.</i>

1218
01:43:10,920 --> 01:43:13,844
<i>In what can only be described
as vehicular warfare,</i>

1219
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:15,729
<i>police are engaged in</i>
a <i>high-speed pursuit...</i>

1220
01:43:18,640 --> 01:43:20,165
I got it. They're
piggybacking the hack

1221
01:43:20,240 --> 01:43:21,651
off that satellite
tower right there.

1222
01:43:21,720 --> 01:43:23,245
Take it out!

1223
01:43:34,880 --> 01:43:35,927
<i>Totem.</i>

1224
01:43:45,160 --> 01:43:47,049
Wait. What happened?
We were almost there.

1225
01:43:47,480 --> 01:43:49,482
They've cut the signal!
I can't finish the hack!

1226
01:43:49,560 --> 01:43:50,561
What do you mean?

1227
01:43:52,520 --> 01:43:54,010
Brian, they took out
the tower!

1228
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,571
Dad,
what's going on?

1229
01:44:02,720 --> 01:44:04,210
Daddy's gotta go to work.

1230
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:23,481
All right, baby girl.

1231
01:44:23,640 --> 01:44:25,369
Elena's gonna be here
in a little bit.

1232
01:44:25,520 --> 01:44:26,760
You know our drill.

1233
01:44:26,840 --> 01:44:28,171
Give me three for the road.

1234
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:48,928
You thought this was
gonna be a street fight'?

1235
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:05,409
You're goddamn right it is.

1236
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:52,887
There has to be another way.

1237
01:45:52,960 --> 01:45:54,371
Wait. I'm seeing
half a dozen

1238
01:45:54,440 --> 01:45:56,568
<i>cell towers between
Sixth and State.</i>

1239
01:45:56,640 --> 01:45:57,846
Brian, if you can
get to the top

1240
01:45:57,920 --> 01:45:59,524
<i>of any one of those
buildings around there,</i>

1241
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:01,807
we can reroute the signal
manually and finish the job.

1242
01:46:01,880 --> 01:46:02,881
I'm on it.

1243
01:46:06,200 --> 01:46:07,326
Sir, did you hear that?

1244
01:46:07,400 --> 01:46:09,402
O'Conner is on foot,
heading for a repeater.

1245
01:46:09,480 --> 01:46:10,925
He's going to try to
reinitiate the hack.

1246
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:12,001
Keep the drone on the girl.

1247
01:46:13,520 --> 01:46:14,521
<i>HEX,</i>

1248
01:46:14,600 --> 01:46:16,568
<i>O'Conner's on foot somewhere
between Sixth and State.</i>

1249
01:46:17,040 --> 01:46:18,451
Don't let him make it there.

1250
01:46:33,640 --> 01:46:34,641
Them boys is on us!

1251
01:46:34,720 --> 01:46:36,245
Man, them boys
ain't ready for this!

1252
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:42,486
Shit!

1253
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:02,968
First the tank,
then the plane.

1254
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:04,326
Now we got a spaceship?

1255
01:47:04,360 --> 01:47:06,601
That's not a spaceship, that's a drone!
Oh, it's a drone?

1256
01:47:06,680 --> 01:47:08,523
Now, you gonna break it down
and be articulate

1257
01:47:08,600 --> 01:47:10,489
like you already know
what the hell is going on'?

1258
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:12,244
Shut your ass up
and drive the car!

1259
01:47:18,920 --> 01:47:20,684
Letty, the football's
on fire!

1260
01:47:20,760 --> 01:47:21,761
We need help!

1261
01:47:23,440 --> 01:47:24,487
Hang on! I'm coming!

1262
01:48:00,080 --> 01:48:01,491
Ramsey, get ready
to go again!

1263
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:06,448
Drone has missile lock.
Fire!

1264
01:48:16,240 --> 01:48:17,401
Target destroyed.

1265
01:48:20,760 --> 01:48:23,491
Let's see n' we
have</i> a <i>connection. If! can getback in...</i>

1266
01:48:23,600 --> 01:48:24,806
Wait, wait, wait!
God's Eye still has her.

1267
01:48:24,880 --> 01:48:26,006
How can that be?

1268
01:48:40,640 --> 01:48:42,483
Get up. Come on!

1269
01:48:43,520 --> 01:48:44,521
Let's go! Let's go!

1270
01:48:48,520 --> 01:48:50,761
They switched her under the bridge.
What?

1271
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:56,286
Gotta get out of here. It's on
your trail and it's coming fast.

1272
01:48:56,360 --> 01:48:57,361
Got it.

1273
01:48:57,440 --> 01:49:00,125
So, if this car goes down,
who's coming to save us?

1274
01:49:00,200 --> 01:49:02,441
Save us, honey?
We're it.

1275
01:49:02,520 --> 01:49:03,521
Where are they now?

1276
01:49:03,640 --> 01:49:04,971
Six blocks east,
hauling ass.

1277
01:49:06,280 --> 01:49:07,441
Where are we
headed, Tej?

1278
01:49:07,560 --> 01:49:09,767
<i>TEA". Theres a service eievator
past the maintenance sector.</i>

1279
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:11,968
<i>It'll take you
directly up to the repeater.</i>

1280
01:49:12,040 --> 01:49:13,485
<i>Brian, you gotta hurry!</i>

1281
01:51:14,320 --> 01:51:15,401
Too slow!

1282
01:51:31,040 --> 01:51:32,087
It's coming back!

1283
01:51:32,160 --> 01:51:33,241
We'll lose them
in thetunnel.

1284
01:51:34,600 --> 01:51:35,931
Got it.
Fire!

1285
01:51:52,880 --> 01:51:54,325
I can't shake this thing!

1286
01:51:57,480 --> 01:51:59,323
Predator has missile lock.

1287
01:51:59,440 --> 01:52:00,965
Take it out!

1288
01:52:27,080 --> 01:52:28,127
No way.

1289
01:52:39,560 --> 01:52:40,971
Wait! What happened?

1290
01:52:41,320 --> 01:52:43,721
Sir, someone just
double-tapped our drone.

1291
01:52:43,800 --> 01:52:44,881
What?

1292
01:52:46,920 --> 01:52:48,524
Hey, did you bring
the cavalry?

1293
01:52:49,360 --> 01:52:51,840
Woman, I am the cavalry.

1294
01:52:52,840 --> 01:52:54,001
Of course you are.

1295
01:52:55,160 --> 01:52:56,286
Who is that?

1296
01:52:59,560 --> 01:53:00,800
That's Hobbs.

1297
01:53:09,640 --> 01:53:10,766
I'm at the repeater.

1298
01:53:10,840 --> 01:53:12,046
The access cable's
in the base.

1299
01:53:12,480 --> 01:53:15,245
<i>Just mug it into your phone and
Ramsey wili be back oniine.</i>

1300
01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:18,041
Ramsey, go!

1301
01:53:22,360 --> 01:53:24,203
Brian did it. We're back in!

1302
01:53:29,440 --> 01:53:30,726
We've got God's Eye back.

1303
01:53:38,360 --> 01:53:39,441
We lost the God's Eye!

1304
01:53:39,600 --> 01:53:41,011
What? Shit!

1305
01:53:45,960 --> 01:53:48,361
Military's inbound.
Three minutes and closing.

1306
01:53:48,520 --> 01:53:49,681
We need to get
the hell out of here.

1307
01:53:52,120 --> 01:53:53,884
Tej, Roman, I'm on my way!

1308
01:53:54,200 --> 01:53:55,440
All right, homie,
I'll see you there.

1309
01:54:43,040 --> 01:54:44,644
I have eyes on Toretto.

1310
01:55:05,080 --> 01:55:06,241
Shaw is in the way.

1311
01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:08,767
Then it seems our
friendship is at an end.

1312
01:55:09,600 --> 01:55:10,601
Do it!

1313
01:55:26,440 --> 01:55:27,965
Thing about street fights,

1314
01:55:30,440 --> 01:55:32,363
the street always wins.

1315
01:56:00,360 --> 01:56:02,203
Goodbye, Toretto.

1316
01:56:10,560 --> 01:56:12,722
Take him out!
Take down the bastard!

1317
01:56:22,680 --> 01:56:23,681
This son of a...

1318
01:56:38,360 --> 01:56:39,486
No!

1319
01:56:40,360 --> 01:56:41,850
Duck!

1320
01:56:41,920 --> 01:56:44,969
I need some help over here!
We're getting nailed!

1321
01:56:45,320 --> 01:56:47,049
<i>I need some backup!</i>

1322
01:56:55,200 --> 01:56:57,771
No! No! Son of a bitch!

1323
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:01,365
He's getting away!

1324
01:57:01,440 --> 01:57:02,965
No! Stop him!

1325
01:57:58,720 --> 01:57:59,721
Don't miss.

1326
01:58:33,400 --> 01:58:34,401
Dom!

1327
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:21,923
Come on, buddy.

1328
01:59:27,280 --> 01:59:28,327
Is he breathing?

1329
01:59:28,480 --> 01:59:30,482
I want you to keep his head
tilted up, all right?

1330
01:59:30,680 --> 01:59:32,091
Keep it back like this.

1331
01:59:32,240 --> 01:59:34,288
Pinch his nose, keep his head tilted.
Breathe into him, now. Go.

1332
01:59:35,680 --> 01:59:36,681
Good. Come on, Dom.

1333
01:59:37,280 --> 01:59:39,009
Come on, Dom. Come on!

1334
01:59:39,160 --> 01:59:40,969
God damn it!
You come on! You breathe!

1335
01:59:41,120 --> 01:59:42,451
Go, go! Breathe.

1336
01:59:42,600 --> 01:59:43,647
Come on. Damn it. Let's go.

1337
01:59:43,720 --> 01:59:47,520
Come on, Dom, I need you to breathe.
Come on! Come on, Dom!

1338
01:59:47,600 --> 01:59:49,011
Come back! Come on, buddy.

1339
01:59:49,080 --> 01:59:50,411
Stop it.
Dom, come on! Come on!

1340
01:59:50,480 --> 01:59:51,481
Back off!

1341
01:59:51,560 --> 01:59:52,891
Will you stop?
Breathe into him.

1342
01:59:52,960 --> 01:59:54,883
Get off of him!
You breathe into him!

1343
01:59:54,960 --> 01:59:56,689
Back off!
You breathe into him!

1344
01:59:56,760 --> 01:59:58,171
Back off!

1345
01:59:59,240 --> 02:00:00,446
Please.

1346
02:00:01,520 --> 02:00:02,885
Dom.

1347
02:00:02,960 --> 02:00:05,691
Dom, baby. I know
you're hurting right now.

1348
02:00:06,320 --> 02:00:09,051
But I want you to listen.
Stay awake

1349
02:00:09,960 --> 02:00:11,485
and focus on me.

1350
02:00:17,200 --> 02:00:19,726
I remember everything.

1351
02:00:20,520 --> 02:00:22,284
It came to me like a flood.

1352
02:00:24,680 --> 02:00:28,002
<i>I remember mat night
in the Dominican Republic.</i>

1353
02:00:29,320 --> 02:00:30,810
The night we got married.

1354
02:00:37,280 --> 02:00:38,486
on, my...

1355
02:00:43,480 --> 02:00:44,641
DOM; Will this do?

1356
02:00:48,640 --> 02:00:50,847
We have eternity
in this moment.

1357
02:00:51,760 --> 02:00:54,331
You will never be alone again.

1358
02:00:54,480 --> 02:00:57,006
I vow whereveryou go, I go.

1359
02:00:57,160 --> 02:00:58,605
You ride, I ride.

1360
02:00:58,760 --> 02:01:00,524
You fight, I fight.

1361
02:01:00,680 --> 02:01:03,047
And if you ever die on me,
Dominic Toretto,

1362
02:01:03,560 --> 02:01:04,800
I'm gonna die with you.

1363
02:01:08,840 --> 02:01:11,047
<i>I/ove you, Letty.
I will always love you.</i>

1364
02:01:11,760 --> 02:01:14,411
If you die, I die.

1365
02:01:17,200 --> 02:01:19,441
And I'm not ready to
leave this place yet.

1366
02:01:20,360 --> 02:01:23,250
This moment is still ours.

1367
02:01:28,200 --> 02:01:30,362
I remember everything.

1368
02:01:31,040 --> 02:01:32,724
I remember it all.

1369
02:01:34,720 --> 02:01:36,882
It's about time.

1370
02:01:51,520 --> 02:01:54,205
Why didn't you tell me
we were married?

1371
02:02:02,280 --> 02:02:05,568
Because you can't tell
someone they love you.

1372
02:02:15,680 --> 02:02:17,011
Holy shit.

1373
02:02:42,840 --> 02:02:45,969
You sure you brought enough
backup with you, Hobbs?

1374
02:02:46,480 --> 02:02:48,005
Oh, they ain't mine.

1375
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:50,610
They're here to protect you

1376
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:53,443
from me killing your ass.

1377
02:03:09,680 --> 02:03:12,331
You do know none of this
will keep me, right?

1378
02:03:16,680 --> 02:03:19,729
Well, once you dig through
38 feet of concrete and steel,

1379
02:03:19,800 --> 02:03:23,646
my fist and a body bag will be
waiting for you on the other side.

1380
02:03:24,320 --> 02:03:26,482
So I suggest you
get to digging, boy.

1381
02:04:01,200 --> 02:04:02,201
<i>MUN. Whoa-hum!</i>

1382
02:04:03,600 --> 02:04:05,045
Daddy! Come play.

1383
02:04:05,400 --> 02:04:06,447
Yeah.

1384
02:04:06,520 --> 02:04:08,204
Look at him. Look at him.

1385
02:04:10,880 --> 02:04:11,881
Yeah, buddy.

1386
02:04:13,560 --> 02:04:15,050
- Duty calls.
- It does.

1387
02:04:15,120 --> 02:04:16,121
Hey, babe, come on.

1388
02:04:16,760 --> 02:04:18,603
Let's get Mama. Yeah!

1389
02:04:18,800 --> 02:04:19,801
Here we go.

1390
02:04:19,880 --> 02:04:23,327
Because the sun is out,
I'm kind of medium rare,

1391
02:04:23,400 --> 02:04:27,086
but I can get, like, well done.
Like, really dark.

1392
02:04:28,560 --> 02:04:29,561
What you nudging me for?

1393
02:04:29,640 --> 02:04:31,210
Close your mouth
for two seconds.

1394
02:04:32,880 --> 02:04:35,087
Just open your eyes, man.

1395
02:04:38,600 --> 02:04:39,726
Beautiful.

1396
02:04:41,400 --> 02:04:43,448
That's where he belongs.

1397
02:04:43,920 --> 02:04:45,570
Home.

1398
02:04:47,080 --> 02:04:48,650
Where he's always belonged.

1399
02:04:53,920 --> 02:04:56,571
Things are gonna
be different now.

1400
02:05:19,680 --> 02:05:20,681
One more time.

1401
02:05:23,240 --> 02:05:25,242
You aren't going
to say goodbye'?

1402
02:05:36,600 --> 02:05:38,967
It's never goodbye.

1403
02:05:40,600 --> 02:05:44,286
<i>It's</i> been along day

Thanks for the invite.
