No, no.

489
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:26,583
You're his brother.
Shouldn't you tell him?

490
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:28,960
I'm not his brother.

491
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,709
He trusts you more than anyone.

492
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:34,503
Now's the time.

497
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:14,715
I'm sorry, I know
I'm not supposed to be down here.

498
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:20,087
Were you hiding from me?

499
00:43:20,181 --> 00:43:21,217
Of course not.

500
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:23,969
What are you doing in Winterfell?

501
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,935
Or did you read every book
in the Citadel already?

502
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:31,566
What's wrong?

503
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:34,025
Gilly? Is she all right?

504
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:36,069
- She's good.
- Little Sam?

505
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:38,814
Don't you know?

506
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:41,442
Know what?

507
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:43,823
Daenerys...

508
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:47,369
she executed my father and brother.

509
00:43:48,084 --> 00:43:49,291
They were her prisoners.

510
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:55,080
She didn't tell you.

511
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:05,508
I'm so sorry.

512
00:44:09,105 --> 00:44:10,562
We need to end this war.

513
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,400
Would you have done it?

514
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,936
Well, I've executed men
who disobeyed me.

515
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:20,067
You've also spared men.

516
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:22,576
Thousands of wildlings
when they refused to kneel.

517
00:44:22,952 --> 00:44:24,113
I wasn't a king.

518
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:27,488
But you were.

519
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:30,619
You've always been.

520
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:34,123
I gave up my crown, Sam.

521
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:37,752
I bent the knee.
I'm not King in the North anymore.

522
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:39,361
I'm not talking about
the King in the North.

523

I'm talking about the King
of the bloody Seven Kingdoms.

524
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:51,474
Bran and I worked it out.

525
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:54,557
I had a High Septon's diary.
Bran had...

526
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:57,351
whatever Bran has.

527
00:44:57,445 --> 00:44:58,652

00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:03,527
Your mother...

529
00:45:04,577 --> 00:45:05,988
was Lyanna Stark.

You've never been a bastard.

535

You're Aegon Targaryen,
true heir to the Iron Throne.

536
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:29,550
I'm sorry,
I know it's a lot to take in.

537
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:42,149
My father was the most honorable man
I ever met.

538
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:47,700
You're saying
he lied to me all my life.

539

No.

540
00:45:49,956 --> 00:45:53,575
Your father... Well, Ned Stark.

541
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:56,623
He promised your mother
he'd always protect you.

542
00:45:57,255 --> 00:45:59,622
And he did. Robert would have
murdered you if he knew.

543
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:03,174

- It's the truth.

We're on foot.

We rode down from Castle Black.

we'll get there before the dead.
