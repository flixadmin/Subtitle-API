Movietown News presents:
Spotlight on Adventure.

2
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,094
What you are now witnessing...

3
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:56,722
is footage never before seen
by civilized humanity,

4
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:58,557
a lost world in South America.

5
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:00,851
Lurking in the shadow
of majestic Paradise Falls,

6
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:03,896
it sports plants and animals
undiscovered by science.

7
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:07,233
Who would dare set foot
on this inhospitable summit?

8
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:11,237
Why, our subject today,
Charles Muntz!

9
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,406
The beloved explorer lands his
dirigible the Spirit of Adventure,

10
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:15,908
in New Hampshire this week,

11
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:19,036
completing a year-long expedition
to the lost world.

12
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:22,039
This lighter-than-air craft
was designed by Muntz himself...

13
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:26,085
and is longer than 22 prohibition
paddy wagons placed end to end.

14
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:28,921
And here comes the adventurer now.

15
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:31,131
Never apart from his faithful dogs,

16
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:33,551
Muntz conceived the craft
for canine comfort.

17
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:35,678
It's a veritable floating palace
in the sky,

18
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:39,223
complete with doggy bath
and mechanical canine walker.

19
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:43,519
And, Jiminy Cricket do the locals
consider Muntz the bee's knees.

20
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:44,937
And how!

21
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,398
Adventure is out there!

22
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:52,111
But what has Muntz brought back
this time?

23
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:56,949
Gentlemen, I give you
the monster of Paradise Falls!

24
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:01,954
And, golly,
what a swell monster this is!

25
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,707
But what's this? Scientists cry foul.

26
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,959
The National Explorer's Society
accuses Muntz...

27
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:08,794
of fabricating the skeleton.

28
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,045
No!

29
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,839
The organization strips Muntz...

30
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:13,132
of his membership.

31
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,804
Humiliated, Muntz vows a return
to Paradise Falls...

32
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:21,807
and promises
to capture the beast alive!

33
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:24,602
I promise to capture the beast alive,

34
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:28,397
and I will not come back until I do!

35
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,443
And so,
the explorer's off to clear his name.

36
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,194
Bon voyage, Charles Muntz,

37
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:38,741
and good luck capturing
the monster of Paradise Falls!

38
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:46,999
Here's Charles Muntz...

39
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,335
piloting his famous dirigible.

40
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,466
He hurdles Pikes Peak.

41
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,552
He hurdles the Grand Canyon.

42
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,597
He hurdles Mount Everest.

43
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:07,269
He goes around Mount Everest.

44
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:10,189
Is there nothing he cannot do?

45
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,568
Yes, as Muntz himself says,
"Adventure is ..."

46
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:18,155
Adventure is out there!
Look out!

47
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:21,158
Mount Rushmore! Hard to starboard!

48
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:25,120
Must get Spirit of Adventure
over Mount Rushmore!

49
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:29,291
Hold together, old girl.
How're my dogs doing?

50
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:36,799
All engines, ahead full!
Let's take her up to 26,000 feet.

51
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,677
Rudders 18 degrees towards the south.

52
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:43,555
It's a beautiful day.
Winds out of the east at 10 knots.

53
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:48,143
Visibility unlimited.
Enter the weather in the logbook.

54
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:52,481
Oh! There's something down there.
I will bring it back for science.

55
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:59,279
Aw! It's a puppy! Ah! No time!
A storm! Lightning. Hail.

56
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:00,823
- What are you doing?
- Ahhh!

57
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:03,826
Don't you know
this is an exclusive club?

58
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,869
Only explorers get in here,

59
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:09,873
not just any kid off the street
with a helmet and a pair of goggles.

60
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,876
Do you think you've got what it takes?
Well, do you?

61
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:16,714
All right, you're in.
Welcome aboard.

62
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,718
What's wrong? Can't you talk?

63
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:25,222
Hey, I don't bite.

64
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:32,104
You and me, we're in a club now.

65
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,945
I saw where your balloon went.
Come on. Let's go get it.

66
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:42,906
My name's Ellie.

67
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:47,578
There it is.

68
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,667
Well, go ahead.

69
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,090
Go on.

70
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:21,570
Ow.

71
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:22,988
Hey, kid!

72
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,325
Thought you might need
a little cheering up.

73
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,243
I got something to show you.

74
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:32,956
I am about to let you
see something...

75
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,792
I have never shown
to another human being.

76
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:38,253
Ever! In my life!

77
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:42,549
You'll have to swear
you will not tell anyone.

78
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:45,928
Cross your heart. Do it!

79
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,849
My Adventure Book.

80
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:54,144
You know him.

81
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,898
Charles Muntz, explorer.

82
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:01,026
When I get big,
I'm going where he's going,

83
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:06,698
South America.
It's like America, but south.

84
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:09,368
Wanna know where I'm gonna live?

85
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:14,331
"Paradise Falls, a land lost in time."

86
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:18,710
I ripped this
right out of a library book.

87
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:23,465
I'm gonna move my clubhouse there
and park it right next to the falls.

88
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:26,176
Who knows what lives up there.

89
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,387
And once I get there?

90
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:32,432
Well, I'm saving these pages for
all the adventures I'm gonna have.

91
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:38,397
Only I just don't know
how I'm gonna get to Paradise Falls.

92
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,198
That's it!
You can take us there in a blimp!

93
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:51,243
Swear you'll take us!
Cross your heart!

94
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:56,373
Cross it! Cross your heart!
Good, you promised. No backing out.

95
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,918
Well, see you tomorrow, kid. Bye!

96
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:04,006
Adventure is out there!

97
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:07,843
You know, you don't talk very much.

98
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,053
I like you!

99
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:13,890
Wow.

100
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,220
Hah!

101
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,860
Stevie, throw me a deuce!

102
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:45,073
Quite a sight, huh, Ellie?

103
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:50,912
Uh! Mail's here.

104
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:08,221
Shady Oaks Retirement.
Oh, brother.

105
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:11,433
Hmm...

106
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,650
Hey! Morning, Mr. Fredricksen.
Need any help there?

107
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,610
No. Yes!

108
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:26,865
Tell your boss over there that
you boys are ruining our house.

109
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,450
Well, just to let you know,

110
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:31,119
my boss will be happy to take
this old place off your hands,

111
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:33,621
and for double his last offer!

112
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:34,914
What do you say to that?

113
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:39,502
Uh, I take that as a "no," then?

114
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:42,964
I believe I made my position
to your boss quite clear.

115
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:45,592
You poured prune juice
in his gas tank.

116
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:48,845
Yeah, that was good.
Here, let me talk to him.

117
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:56,519
You in the suit.
Yes, you. Take a bath, hippie!

118
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,022
I am not with him!

119
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:02,692
This is serious!
He's out to get your house.

120
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:05,778
Tell your boss
he can have our house.

121
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:08,323
- Really?
- When I'm dead!

122
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:12,160
I'll take that as a maybe.

123
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,496
Order now,
you get the camera,

124
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:17,790
you get the printer,
4x optical zoom,

125
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,376
Schneider lens, photo printer,
SD card.

126
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:28,301
"Good afternoon.
My name is Russell."

127
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:33,681
"And I am a Wilderness Explorer
in Tribe 54, Sweat Lodge 12."

128
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,809
"Are you in need
of any assistance today, sir?"

129
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:37,936
No.

130
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:41,189
- I could help you cross the street.
- No.

131
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:45,235
- I could help you cross your yard.
- No.

132
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:48,988
- I could help you cross your porch.
- No.

133
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,407
Well,
I gotta help you cross something.

134
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:53,535
No. I'm doing fine.

135
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:02,335
"Good afternoon.
My name is Russell."

136
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:04,546
- Kid... Kid.
- "And I am a Wilderness Explorer...

137
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:09,217
- in Tribe 54, Sweat Lodge 12."
- I... Slow down. Kid!

138
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:11,553
- "Are you in need of any assistance ..."
- Thank you,

139
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,179
- but I don't need any help!
- " ...today, sir?"

140
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,057
Ow.

141
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,729
Proceed.

142
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:25,108
- "Good afternoon ..."
- But skip to the end!

143
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:30,029
See these? These are
my Wilderness Explorer badges.

144
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:35,243
You may notice one is missing.
It's my Assisting the Elderly badge.

145
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:40,039
If I get it, I will become
a Senior Wilderness Explorer.

146
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:42,750
"The wilderness must be explored!"

147
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:44,919
Caw, caw! Raar!

148
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,798
It's gonna be great!
There's a big ceremony,

149
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:52,385
and all the dads come,
and they pin on our badges.

150
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:54,429
So, you want to assist an old person?

151
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:57,932
Yep! Then I'll be
a Senior Wilderness Explorer.

152
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:02,270
- You ever heard of a snipe?
- Snipe?

153
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:04,355
Bird. Beady eyes.

154
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:08,443
Every night it sneaks in my yard
and gobbles my poor azaleas.

155
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:14,240
I'm elderly and infirm. I can't catch it.
If only someone could help me.

156
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:17,744
- Me, me! I'll do it!
- I don't know. It's awfully crafty.

157
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:20,788
You'd have to clap your hands
three times to lure it in.

158
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:22,665
I'll find him, Mr. Fredricksen!

159
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,126
I think its burrow is two blocks down.
If you go past...

160
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:28,296
Two blocks down. Got it! Snipe.

161
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:31,215
Here, snipey, snipey.

162
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,967
Bring it back here when you find it.

163
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:34,135
Snipe!

164
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:35,345
Okay, keep her coming.
Keep coming.

165
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:40,475
And stop. Stop. Stop!

166
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:45,188
Why... Hey! Hey, you!

167
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:46,773
What do you...
What do you think you're doing?

168
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:49,317
- I am so sorry, sir.
- Don't touch that!

169
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:50,943
No, no, no.
Let me take care of that for you.

170
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,112
- Get away from our mailbox!
- Hey. Sir, I...

171
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:54,697
I don't want you to touch it!

172
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:55,823
Ow!

173
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:08,670
Steve, you all right?

174
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:44,872
Sorry, Mr. Fredricksen.

175
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:49,210
You don't seem like
a public menace to me. Take this.

176
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:53,381
The guys from Shady Oaks will be by
to pick you up in the morning, okay?

177
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,689
What do I do now, Ellie?

178
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,113
Morning, gentlemen.

179
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:44,158
Good morning, Mr. Fredricksen.
You ready to go?

180
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:47,370
Ready as I'll ever be.

181
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,789
Would you do me a favor
and take this?

182
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:52,208
I'll meet you at the van
in just a minute.

183
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:56,629
I wanna say one last goodbye
to the old place.

184
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,507
Sure.
Take all the time you need, sir.

185
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:06,097
That's typical. He's probably going
to the bathroom for the 80th time.

186
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:09,851
You think he'd take better
care of his house.

187
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:56,147
So long, boys! I'll send you a
postcard from Paradise Falls!

188
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:45,446
Heh!

189
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,904
We're on our way, Ellie.

190
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:14,827
Huh?

191
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,000
Hmm.

192
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:40,061
Hi, Mr. Fredricksen.
It's me, Russell.

193
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,146
What are you doing out here, kid?

194
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:45,983
I found the snipe
and I followed it under your porch,

195
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:50,905
but this snipe had a long tail
and looked more like a large mouse.

196
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:58,412
Please let me in.

197
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,081
No.

198
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,837
Oh, alright, you can come...

199
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,055
Huh.

200
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:21,268
I've never been
in a floating house before.

201
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:26,899
Goggles. Look at this stuff.
Wow! You're going on a trip?

202
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:30,694
"Paradise Falls,
a land lost in time."

203
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,530
You're going to South America,
Mr. Fredricksen?

204
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,448
Don't touch that! You'll soil it.

205
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:36,617
You know, most people take a plane,

206
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:40,037
but you're smart because you will
have all your TV and clocks and stuff.

207
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:43,040
Whoa.
Is this how you steer your house?

208
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:44,542
Does it really work?

209
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,044
Kid, would you stop with the...

210
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:48,712
- This makes it go right.
- Let go of that...

211
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:51,298
- And that way's left.
- Knock it off!

212
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:53,425
Hey, look! Buildings.

213
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:57,429
That building's so close
I could almost touch it.

214
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:02,768
Wow! This is great!

215
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:05,312
You should try this,
Mr. Fredricksen.

216
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:08,816
Look, there's a bus that could
take me home two blocks away!

217
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,443
Hey! I can see your house from here.

218
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:14,321
Don't jerk around so much, kid. Whoa!

219
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:17,992
Well, that's not gonna work.

220
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,328
I know that cloud.
It's a cumulonimbus.

221
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:22,496
Did you know that...

222
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,248
the cumulonimbus forms...

223
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:25,833
when warm air rises over cool air?

224
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:29,253
Stayed up all night
blowing up balloons... for what?

225
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:30,421
...and that's how we get lightning.

226
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:31,922
- That's nice, kid.
- Mr. Fredricksen?

227
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:35,176
There's a storm coming.
It's starting to get scary.

228
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:38,929
We're gonna get blown to bits!
We're in big trouble...

229
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:42,850
- What are you doing over there?
- Look.

230
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:56,655
See? Cumulonimbus.

231
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:33,734
My pack!

232
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:39,907
Got ya!

233
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:18,904
I thought you were dead.

234
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:23,033
What happened?

235
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:26,537
I steered us. I did.
I steered the house.

236
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:27,705
Steered us?

237
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:30,541
After you tied your stuff down,
you took a nap.

238
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:32,710
So I went ahead
and steered us down here.

239
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:34,503
Yeah. Sure.

240
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,476
Can't tell where we are.

241
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:51,562
Oh, we're in South America, all right.

242
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:55,316
It was a cinch
with my Wilderness Explorer GPS.

243
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:58,068
- GP... What?
- My dad gave it to me.

244
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:00,487
It shows exactly where we are
on the planet.

245
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:05,326
With this baby, we'll never be lost!

246
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:10,998
Oops.

247
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:14,918
We'll get you down, find a bus stop,

248
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:18,088
you just tell the man
you wanna go back to your mother.

249
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:21,842
Sure, but I don't think
they have buses in Paradise Falls.

250
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:27,348
There. That ought to do it.

251
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,266
Here, I'll give you
some change for bus fare.

252
00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:31,852
No, I'll just use
my city bus pass.

253
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:35,606
Whoa. That's gonna be
like a billion transfers...

254
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,358
to get back to my house.

255
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:46,784
Mr. Fredricksen, how much longer?

256
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:50,704
Well, we're up pretty high.
Could take hours to get down.

257
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:55,125
That thing was... building or something.

258
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:58,629
What was that, Mr. Fredricksen?

259
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:01,048
We can't be close to the ground yet.

260
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:12,893
Wait! Wait, no, don't! Don't, don't!

261
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:15,687
Wait, wait. Wait!

262
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:23,862
- Russell, hang on! Hey!
- Whoa! Whoa!

263
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:33,872
Aarrgggghhhhh!

264
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:35,582
- Walk back. Walk back.
- Okay.

265
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,501
Come on. Come on.

266
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:52,933
Where... Where are we?

267
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:57,771
This doesn't look like the city
or the jungle, Mr. Fredricksen.

268
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:02,609
Don't worry, Ellie. I got it.

269
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,428
There it is.

270
00:31:57,457 --> 00:32:00,000
Ellie, it's so beautiful.

271
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:03,921
We made it.

272
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:08,759
We made it! Russell! We could float
right over there! Climb up. Climb up!

273
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:10,260
You mean, assist you?

274
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:12,596
- Yeah, yeah. Whatever.
- Okay. I'll climb up.

275
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:20,354
- Watch it!
- Sorry.

276
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:31,823
Now, when you get up there,
go ahead and hoist me up!

277
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:34,159
Got it?

278
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:39,957
You on the porch yet?

279
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:48,382
What? That's it?

280
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:54,054
I came all this way just to get stuck
at the wrong end of this rock pile?

281
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:56,807
Great.

282
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:05,566
Hey, if I could assist you over there,
would you sign off on my badge?

283
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:10,821
- What are you talking about?
- We could walk your house to the falls.

284
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:14,491
- Walk it?
- Yeah! After all, we weigh it down.

285
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:17,911
We could walk it right over there.
Like a parade balloon.

286
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:25,502
Now, we're gonna walk
to the falls quickly and quietly...

287
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:28,213
- with no rap music or flash dancing.
- Uh-huh.

288
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:33,093
We have three days, at best, before
the helium leaks out of those balloons.

289
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:35,679
And if we're not at the falls
when that happens...

290
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:38,098
- Sand.
- ...we're not getting to the falls.

291
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:40,058
I found sand!

292
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:44,605
Don't you worry, Ellie.
We'll get our house over there.

293
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:51,612
This is fun already, isn't it?

294
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:55,574
By the time we get there,
you're gonna feel so assisted.

295
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:59,286
Oh, Mr. Fredricksen,
if we happen to get separated,

296
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:01,538
use the Wilderness Explorer call.

297
00:34:01,623 --> 00:34:03,624
Caw, caw! Raar!

298
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,544
Wait. Why are we going
to Paradise Falls again?

299
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:09,713
Hey, let's play a game.

300
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:13,050
It's called
"see who can be quiet the longest."

301
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:15,969
Cool!
My mom loves that game!

302
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:19,825
Darn thing!

303
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:23,537
Come on, Russell.
Would you hurry it up?

304
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:27,874
I'm tired. And my knee hurts.

305
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,501
Which knee?

306
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:34,548
My elbow hurts,
and I have to go to the bathroom.

307
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:37,384
I asked you about that five minutes ago.

308
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:40,679
Well, I didn't have to go then!

309
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:47,144
I don't wanna walk anymore.
Can we stop?

310
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:50,313
Russell, if you don't hurry up,
the tigers will eat you.

311
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:54,860
There are no tigers in South America.
Zoology.

312
00:35:56,404 --> 00:36:00,157
Oh, for the love of Pete! Go on into
the bushes and do your business.

313
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,409
Okay! Here! Hold my stuff.

314
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:07,038
I've always wanted to try this.

315
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:12,252
Mr. Fredricksen,

316
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:15,338
am I supposed to dig the hole
before or after?

317
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,008
None of my concern!

318
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:21,595
Oh. It's before!

319
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,263
Bah!
La la la la la!

320
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:27,726
Huh?

321
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,021
Tracks?

322
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,356
Snipe.

323
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:38,904
Here, snipe. Come on out, snipe.

324
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:41,698
Snipe.

325
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:43,867
Huh?

326
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:04,221
Ha! Gotcha!
Don't be afraid, little snipe.

327
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:08,975
I am a Wilderness Explorer,
so I'm a friend to all of nature.

328
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,269
Want some more?

329
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:17,943
Hi, boy. Don't eat it all.
Come on out.

330
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:24,491
Come on. Come on.
Don't be afraid, little snipe.

331
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:29,246
Nice snipe. Good little snipe.
Nice...

332
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,249
Giant snipe.

333
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:40,173
- I found the snipe!
- Oh! Did you?

334
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:42,801
- Are they tall?
- Oh, yes, they're very tall.

335
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:45,929
- Do they have a lot of colors?
- They do, indeed!

336
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:49,766
- Do they like chocolate?
- Oh, yes... chocolate?

337
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:55,355
- Gah! What is that thing?
- It's a snipe!

338
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:57,440
There's no such thing as a snipe!

339
00:37:57,525 --> 00:38:00,277
- But you said snipes eat your... Whoa!
- Hey!

340
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:04,364
Go on! Get out of here! Go on!

341
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:10,996
Whoa!

342
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:13,290
Whoa!

343
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:16,376
Careful, Russell!

344
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:20,380
Hey, look, Mr. Fredricksen.
It likes me. Whoa!

345
00:38:20,882 --> 00:38:23,717
- Russell!
- No, stop! That tickles.

346
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:26,970
Get out of here! Go on! Get!

347
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:39,149
Uh-oh. No, no, no! Kevin!
It's okay. Mr. Fredricksen is nice.

348
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:42,402
- Kevin?
- Yeah. That's his name I just gave him.

349
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:47,741
Beat it! Vamoose! Scram!
Hey! That's mine!

350
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,247
Shoo! Shoo! Get out of here!

351
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:57,000
Go on! Beat it!

352
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,590
Can we keep him? Please?

353
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:07,594
I'll get the food for him. I'll walk him.
I'll change his newspapers.

354
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:08,762
No.

355
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:14,100
"An Explorer is a friend to all,
be it plants or fish or tiny mole."

356
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:16,937
- That doesn't even rhyme.
- Yeah, it does.

357
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:19,940
- Hey, look. Kevin.
- What?

358
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:24,110
Get down!
You're not allowed up there!

359
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:28,949
You come down here right now!

360
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,119
Sheesh!

361
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:35,288
Can you believe this, Ellie?

362
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:36,456
Ellie?

363
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:40,210
Hey, Ellie! Could I keep the bird?

364
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:43,129
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

365
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:45,548
She said for you to let me.

366
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:47,467
But I told him no. I told you no!

367
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:48,969
N-O.

368
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:03,149
I see you back there.

369
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:08,989
Go on! Get out of here! Shoo!
Go annoy someone else for a while.

370
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,657
Hey, are you okay over there?

371
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:16,913
Uh... Hello?

372
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,293
Oh!

373
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:25,088
Hello, sir! Thank goodness.

374
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:27,590
It's nice to know
someone else is up here.

375
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:29,467
I can smell you.

376
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:33,179
What? You can smell us?

377
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:36,641
I can smell you.

378
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:45,025
Hey.

379
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:47,527
You were talking to a rock.

380
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,697
Hey, that one looks like a turtle.

381
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:53,783
Look at that one!
That one looks like a dog.

382
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:57,203
- It is a dog!
- What?

383
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:01,207
We're not allowed to have dogs
in my apartment.

384
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:04,878
Hey, I like dogs.

385
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:06,629
We have your dog!

386
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:09,049
- Whoa!
- Wonder who he belongs to.

387
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:12,719
Sit, boy. Hey, look, he's trained.
Shake.

388
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:14,137
Uh-huh.

389
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:15,221
- Speak.
- Hi, there.

390
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:19,225
Did that dog just say "Hi, there"?

391
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:20,518
Oh, yes.

392
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:24,647
My name is Dug.
I have just met you, and I love you.

393
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:29,069
My master made me this collar.
He is a good and smart master,

394
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:32,697
and he made me this collar
so that I may talk. Squirrel!

395
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:35,909
My master is good and smart.

396
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:37,077
It's not possible.

397
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:39,662
Oh, it is,
because my master is smart.

398
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:41,748
- Cool! What do these do, boy?
- Hey, would you...

399
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,084
I use that collar...

400
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:47,587
to talk with.
I would be happy if you stopped.

401
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:51,091
Russell, don't touch that!
It could be radioactive or something!

402
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:52,509
I am a great tracker.

403
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:55,678
My pack sent me on a special mission
all by myself.

404
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:56,846
Have you seen a bird?

405
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:59,182
I want to find one,
and I've been on the scent.

406
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:01,434
I am a great tracker.
Did I mention that?

407
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:04,270
Hey, that is the bird.

408
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:07,273
I have never seen one up close,
but this is the bird.

409
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:09,859
May I take your bird back to camp
as my prisoner?

410
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:13,947
Yes, yes, take it. And on the way,
learn how to bark like a real dog.

411
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:15,115
I can bark.

412
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:17,450
And here's howling.

413
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:24,207
Can we keep him?
Please, please, please!

414
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:27,460
- No.
- But it's a talking dog!

415
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:31,131
It's just a weird trick or something.
Let's get to the falls.

416
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:32,632
Please be my prisoner.

417
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:35,301
Oh, please, oh,
please be my prisoner!

418
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:41,307
Oh! Here it is.
I picked up the bird's scent!

419
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:43,726
Wait a minute, wait a minute!
What is this?

420
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:45,645
Chocolate. I smell chocolate.

421
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:50,233
I'm getting prunes and denture cream!
Who are they?

422
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:52,652
Oh, man,
Master will not be pleased.

423
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:55,780
We better tell him someone
took the bird. Right, Alpha?

424
00:42:57,491 --> 00:42:58,575
No.

425
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:01,494
Soon enough the bird
will be ours yet again.

426
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:03,663
Find the scent, my compadres,

427
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:05,498
and you too shall
have much rewardings...

428
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:08,334
from Master for the toil factor
you wage.

429
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:12,088
Hey, Alpha, I think there's
something wrong with your collar.

430
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:13,423
You must've bumped it.

431
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:15,800
Yeah, your voice sounds funny!

432
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:23,683
Beta! Gamma!
Mayhaps you desire to... Squirrel!

433
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:27,770
Mayhaps you desire
to challenge the ranking...

434
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:30,440
that I have been assigned
by my strength and cunning.

435
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:34,319
No, no, no. But maybe Dug would.
You might wanna ask him.

436
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:40,241
Yeah. I wonder if he's found the
bird on his very special mission.

437
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:42,410
Do not mention Dug
to me at this time.

438
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:47,749
His fool's errand will keep him
most occupied. Most occupied indeed.

439
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:52,879
Do you not agree with that
which I am saying to you now?

440
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:57,258
Sure, but the second Master finds
out you sent Dug out by himself,

441
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:58,927
none of us will get a treat.

442
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:02,138
You are wise,
my trusted lieutenant.

443
00:44:03,933 --> 00:44:06,517
This is Alpha calling Dug.
Come in, Dug.

444
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:09,437
Hi, Alpha.
Hey, your voice sounds funny.

445
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:12,607
I know, I know!
Have you seen the bird?

446
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:15,443
Why, yes.
The bird is my prisoner now.

447
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:16,986
Yeah, right!

448
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:20,782
Impossible! Where are you?

449
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:22,283
I am here with the bird,

450
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:25,119
and I will bring it back,
and then you will like me.

451
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:27,622
- Gotta go.
- Hey, Dug, who you talking to?

452
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:29,624
- No, wait, wait!
- What's Dug doing?

453
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:31,542
Why's he with
that small mailman?

454
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:33,253
Where are they?

455
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,632
There he is. Come on!

456
00:44:42,263 --> 00:44:44,973
Oh, please, oh, please,
oh, please be my prisoner.

457
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:46,474
Dug, stop bothering Kevin!

458
00:44:46,558 --> 00:44:48,476
That man there says
I can take the bird,

459
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:51,312
and I love that man there
like he is my master.

460
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:52,480
I am not your master!

461
00:44:52,564 --> 00:44:54,107
I am warning you
once again, bird.

462
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:56,192
- Hey! Quit it!
- I am jumping on you now, bird.

463
00:44:56,277 --> 00:44:58,569
Russell, at this rate,
we'll never get to the falls.

464
00:44:58,654 --> 00:44:59,988
Here, bird.

465
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:09,872
I am nobody's master, got it?

466
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:12,417
I don't want you here,
and I don't want you here!

467
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:13,793
I'm stuck with you!

468
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:16,546
And if you two don't clear out of here
by the time I count to three...

469
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:19,173
A ball! Oh, boy, oh, boy!
A ball!

470
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:22,677
Ball? Yeah, yeah? You want it, boy?

471
00:45:23,345 --> 00:45:24,637
Huh? Huh? Yeah. Yeah?

472
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:26,764
Yes, I do!
I do ever so want the ball.

473
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:28,308
- Go get it!
- Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

474
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:30,226
I will get it and then bring it back!

475
00:45:30,311 --> 00:45:31,853
Quick, Russell.
Give me some chocolate.

476
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:33,980
- Why?
- Just give it to me!

477
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,815
Bird. Bird!

478
00:45:38,193 --> 00:45:39,986
Come on, Russell.

479
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:42,697
Wait. Wait, Mr. Fredricksen.

480
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:49,620
What are we doing?

481
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:58,838
Hey, we're pretty far now.
Kevin's gonna miss me.

482
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:06,471
I think that did the trick.

483
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:09,724
Hi, Master.

484
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:11,893
Afternoon.

485
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:40,588
Well, thanks for keeping us
dry anyway, Ellie.

486
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:42,548
Which one's the front?

487
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:45,426
Oh, boy.

488
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:49,222
Is this step three or step five?

489
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:52,767
There.

490
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:59,065
All done! That's for you.

491
00:47:05,406 --> 00:47:06,489
Oh...

492
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:08,074
Tents are hard.

493
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:13,871
Wait. Aren't you super wilderness guy,
with the GPMs and the badges?

494
00:47:14,581 --> 00:47:18,668
Yeah, but can I tell you a secret?

495
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:22,088
- No.
- All right. Here it goes.

496
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:26,134
I never actually built a tent before.
There, I said it.

497
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:28,845
You've been camping before,
haven't you?

498
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:31,389
Well, never outside.

499
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:35,309
Well, why didn't you ask your dad
how to build a tent?

500
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:38,604
I don't think he wants
to talk about this stuff.

501
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:41,315
Well, why don't you try him sometime.
Maybe he'll surprise you.

502
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,734
Well, he's away a lot.
I don't see him much.

503
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:45,445
He's gotta be home sometime.

504
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:49,782
Well, I call, but Phyllis told me
I bug him too much.

505
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:53,286
Phyllis? You call your own mother
by her first name?

506
00:47:53,745 --> 00:47:55,538
Phyllis isn't my mom.

507
00:47:57,791 --> 00:47:58,833
Oh.

508
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:10,094
But he promised he'd come to
my Explorer ceremony...

509
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:12,972
to pin on my
'Assisting the Elderly' badge.

510
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:17,185
So, he can show me
about tents then, right?

511
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:26,360
Hey, why don't you get some sleep?

512
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:30,281
Don't wanna wake up
the traveling flea circus.

513
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:33,826
Mr. Fredricksen?

514
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:36,787
Dug says he wants
to take Kevin prisoner.

515
00:48:37,664 --> 00:48:39,624
We have to protect him.

516
00:48:41,835 --> 00:48:43,878
Can Kevin go with us?

517
00:48:45,506 --> 00:48:47,423
All right, he can come.

518
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:50,218
Promise you won't leave him?

519
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:52,845
- Yeah.
- Cross your heart?

520
00:49:01,396 --> 00:49:02,939
Cross my heart.

521
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:10,988
What have I got myself into, Ellie?

522
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:35,930
Morning, sweetheart.

523
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:39,684
We better get moving.

524
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:43,729
Bird's gone.

525
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:47,400
Maybe Russell won't notice.
All right, everybody up!

526
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:52,697
Where's Kevin? He's wandered off!
Kevin! Dug, find Kevin!

527
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:56,617
Find the bird, find the bird!
Hi, hi. Point!

528
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:58,578
Look. There he is!

529
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:02,164
Point!

530
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:06,210
Hey! That's my food!
Get off my roof!

531
00:50:06,295 --> 00:50:07,545
Yeah, get off of his...

532
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:14,218
What is it doing?

533
00:50:14,303 --> 00:50:16,721
The bird is calling to her babies.

534
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:19,307
Her babies.

535
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,226
Kevin's a girl?

536
00:50:24,605 --> 00:50:27,356
Her house is over there
in those twisty rocks.

537
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:32,028
She has been gathering food for
her babies and must get back to them.

538
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,947
Wait. Kevin's just leaving?

539
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:40,036
But you promised to protect her.

540
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:43,414
Her babies need her.
We gotta make sure they're together!

541
00:50:43,498 --> 00:50:46,542
Sorry, Russell.
We've lost enough time already.

542
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:49,128
Yeah.

543
00:50:56,803 --> 00:50:59,513
This was her favorite chocolate.

544
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:04,185
Because you sent her away,
there's more for you.

545
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:06,896
Huh?

546
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,147
Kevin?

547
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:29,752
Where's the bird?
You said you had the bird.

548
00:51:29,836 --> 00:51:31,045
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

549
00:51:31,129 --> 00:51:34,173
Since I have said that,
I can see how you would think that.

550
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:37,343
- Where is it?
- Uh... Tomorrow.

551
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:41,305
Come back tomorrow, and then
I will again have the bird. Yes.

552
00:51:42,557 --> 00:51:46,227
You lost it! Why do I
not have a surprised feeling?

553
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:50,022
Well, at least you now have led us
to the small mailman...

554
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:52,608
and the one who smells of prunes.

555
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:56,779
Master will be most pleased
we have found them...

556
00:51:56,863 --> 00:51:59,782
and will ask of them many questions.
Come!

557
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:03,411
Wait. We're not going with you!
We're going to the falls!

558
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:07,039
Get away from me!

559
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:12,169
Get down!

560
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:07,600
Stay!

561
00:53:15,817 --> 00:53:18,402
You came here in that?

562
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:20,154
Uh, yeah.

563
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:24,742
In a house? A floating house?

564
00:53:33,251 --> 00:53:36,086
That is the darnedest thing
I've ever seen.

565
00:53:36,671 --> 00:53:39,215
You're not after my bird, are you?

566
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:42,176
But if you needed to borrow
a cup of sugar,

567
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:44,512
I'd be happy to oblige.

568
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:50,476
Well, this is all a misunderstanding.

569
00:53:50,936 --> 00:53:52,770
My dogs made a mistake.

570
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:55,773
Wait. Are you Charles Muntz?

571
00:53:55,857 --> 00:53:58,484
Yeah, well, yes.

572
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:00,694
THE Charles Muntz?

573
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:02,988
"Adventure is out there!"

574
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:06,617
It's really him!
That's Charles Muntz!

575
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:10,287
- It is? Who's Charles Muntz?
- Him!

576
00:54:10,372 --> 00:54:12,206
- Yes! Yes! That's him!
- I'm Carl Fredricksen.

577
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:15,125
My wife and I,
we were your biggest fans.

578
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:16,961
Oh, well.
You're a man of good taste.

579
00:54:19,297 --> 00:54:21,465
Now, you must be tired. Hungry?

580
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:22,591
Uh-huh.

581
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:24,134
Now, attention, everyone!

582
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:28,055
These people are no longer intruders!
They are our guests.

583
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:32,643
Follow me.
I like you temporarily.

584
00:54:32,727 --> 00:54:34,436
You do smell like prunes.

585
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:35,563
Whoa!

586
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:38,315
I will not bite you.

587
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,860
The small mailman
smells like chocolate.

588
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:44,280
I'm sorry about the dogs.

589
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:47,366
- Hope they weren't too rough on you.
- We weren't.

590
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:50,911
Go ahead and moor
your airship right next to mine.

591
00:54:56,543 --> 00:55:00,129
We're not actually going inside
the Spirit of Adventure itself?

592
00:55:00,213 --> 00:55:01,255
Oh...

593
00:55:01,506 --> 00:55:03,090
Would you like to?

594
00:55:03,174 --> 00:55:04,425
Would I?

595
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:08,429
Wait up, Mr. Muntz.

596
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:10,806
Jiminy Cricket.

597
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:13,183
- Not you.
- What do we do with Dug?

598
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:17,021
He has lost the bird.
Put him in the 'Cone of Shame'.

599
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:24,320
I do not like the 'Cone of Shame'.

600
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:29,950
Well, most of the collection
is housed in the world's top museums,

601
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:33,787
New York, Munich, London.
Of course, I kept the best for myself.

602
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:36,999
Did you ever! Will you look at that?

603
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:39,585
Oh, yes, the Arsinoitherium.

604
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:42,379
Beast charged
while I was brushing my teeth.

605
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:45,215
Used my shaving kit to bring him down.

606
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,009
Oh, yeah. Well, surprise me.

607
00:55:47,093 --> 00:55:49,511
Only way to get it out
of Ethiopia at the time...

608
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:52,556
was to have it declared
as dental equipment.

609
00:55:52,974 --> 00:55:56,352
Oh, my gosh!
The giant Somalian leopard tortoise!

610
00:55:56,436 --> 00:55:59,313
Oh, you recognize it. I'm impressed.

611
00:55:59,648 --> 00:56:01,690
That's an interesting story there.

612
00:56:02,108 --> 00:56:03,817
Excellent choice.

613
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:07,696
I found it on safari with Roosevelt.

614
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:11,659
He and I fell into a habit of
playing "gin rummy" in the evenings,

615
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:13,577
and did he cheat!

616
00:56:13,662 --> 00:56:15,913
Oh, he was horrible.

617
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:19,166
Master, dinner is ready.

618
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:21,627
Oh, dear. Broken translator.

619
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:26,298
It's that loose wire again.
There you go, big fella.

620
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:27,758
Thank you, Master.

621
00:56:27,842 --> 00:56:30,052
I liked his other voice.

622
00:56:31,262 --> 00:56:34,556
Well, dinner is served.
Right this way.

623
00:56:35,684 --> 00:56:38,852
So, how are things stateside, huh?

624
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:41,355
Almost tempted to go back a few times,

625
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:45,025
but I have unfinished work here.

626
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:48,112
Please. I hope you're hungry,

627
00:56:48,196 --> 00:56:52,491
because Epsilon is the finest chef
I've ever had.

628
00:56:57,288 --> 00:57:00,290
Oh, Epsilon, you've done it again!

629
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:01,417
Yes!

630
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:04,962
Hey! Hey!

631
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:08,424
Oh, my Ellie would've loved all this.

632
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:10,968
You know, it's because of you
she had this dream...

633
00:57:11,052 --> 00:57:13,721
to come down here
and live by Paradise Falls.

634
00:57:13,805 --> 00:57:16,348
I'm honored. And now you've made it.

635
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:18,892
You're sure we're not a bother?
I'd hate to impose.

636
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:23,022
No, no. It's a pleasure to have guests,
a real treat.

637
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:24,523
- Treat! Where's the treat!
- Treat!

638
00:57:25,734 --> 00:57:27,651
No, no. Quiet!
Calm down, calm down.

639
00:57:27,736 --> 00:57:29,153
- I want a treat! I want a treat!
- Hey!

640
00:57:29,237 --> 00:57:30,821
I shouldn't have used that word.

641
00:57:30,905 --> 00:57:33,657
Having guests is a delight.

642
00:57:33,742 --> 00:57:37,619
More often I get thieves come
to steal what's rightfully mine.

643
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:38,746
No!

644
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:43,751
They called me a fraud, those...

645
00:57:46,337 --> 00:57:50,257
But once I bring back this creature,
my name will be cleared.

646
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:53,135
Beautiful, isn't it?

647
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:58,474
I've spent a lifetime tracking it.

648
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:04,271
Sometimes years go by
between sightings.

649
00:58:05,231 --> 00:58:09,818
I've tried to smoke it out of that
deathly labyrinth where it lives.

650
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:12,321
You can't go in after it.

651
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:15,032
Once in, there's no way out.

652
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:17,618
I've lost so many dogs.

653
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:24,792
And here they come, these bandits,
and think the bird is theirs to take.

654
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:30,506
But they soon find that this mountain
is a very dangerous place.

655
00:58:33,259 --> 00:58:35,344
Hey, that looks like Kevin.

656
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:40,224
- Kevin?
- Yeah, that's my new giant bird pet.

657
00:58:40,308 --> 00:58:42,392
I trained it to follow us.

658
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:45,687
Follow you? It's impossible. How?

659
00:58:46,147 --> 00:58:48,607
- She likes chocolate.
- Chocolate?

660
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:52,611
Yeah. I gave her some of my chocolate.
She goes gaga for it.

661
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:55,614
But it ran off. It's gone now.

662
00:59:02,455 --> 00:59:07,042
You know, Carl, these people
who pass through here,

663
00:59:07,127 --> 00:59:09,711
they all tell pretty good stories.

664
00:59:12,423 --> 00:59:14,675
A surveyor making a map.

665
00:59:16,511 --> 00:59:18,804
A botanist cataloguing plants.

666
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:27,563
An old man taking his house
to Paradise Falls.

667
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:38,240
I mean, that's the best one yet.
I can't wait to hear how it ends.

668
00:59:47,876 --> 00:59:51,503
Well, it's been a wonderful evening,
but we better be going.

669
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:52,921
Oh, you're not leaving.

670
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:56,633
We don't want to take advantage
of your hospitality.

671
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:59,928
- Come on, Russell.
- But we haven't even had dessert yet.

672
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:02,931
The boy's right.
You haven't had dessert.

673
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:07,644
Epsilon here makes
a delicious cherries jubilee.

674
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:11,940
Oh, you really must stay. I insist.

675
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:14,943
We have so much more to talk about.

676
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:20,449
Kevin?

677
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:29,541
It's here.

678
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:32,753
Get them!

679
01:00:35,506 --> 01:00:37,925
- Hurry!
- I am hurrying!

680
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:40,302
Ahhh! They're coming!

681
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:45,015
Master, over here.

682
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:02,824
Go toward the light, Master!

683
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:38,986
Get back!

684
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:45,534
Go on, Master!
I will stop the dogs!

685
01:01:46,744 --> 01:01:48,370
Stop, you dogs.

686
01:01:59,257 --> 01:02:00,716
Whoa!

687
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:17,858
Help!

688
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:21,361
Help!

689
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:25,949
Caw, caw! Raar!
Caw, caw! Raar!

690
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:27,909
Give me your hand!

691
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:40,964
Hang on to Kevin!

692
01:03:12,538 --> 01:03:13,914
Kevin.

693
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:41,566
Oh, no, no, no. Kevin. Stay down.

694
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:46,863
She's hurt real bad.
Can't we help her get home?

695
01:03:57,834 --> 01:04:00,419
All right, but we gotta hurry.

696
01:04:07,051 --> 01:04:08,552
You lost them?

697
01:04:08,636 --> 01:04:09,803
No, it was Dug.

698
01:04:09,887 --> 01:04:13,223
Yeah. He's with them.
He helped them escape!

699
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:15,642
Wait.

700
01:04:15,977 --> 01:04:18,520
Wait a minute. Dug.

701
01:04:25,153 --> 01:04:26,278
See anything?

702
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:29,823
No. My pack is not following us.
Boy, they are dumb.

703
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:31,366
This is crazy.

704
01:04:31,451 --> 01:04:35,036
I finally meet my childhood hero, and
he's trying to kill us. What a joke!

705
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:36,496
Hey, I know a joke.

706
01:04:36,622 --> 01:04:38,498
A squirrel walks up to a tree
and says,

707
01:04:38,624 --> 01:04:41,793
"I forgot to store acorns
for winter and now I am dead."

708
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:45,213
Ha! It is funny
because the squirrel gets dead.

709
01:04:48,801 --> 01:04:50,552
Careful, Russell.

710
01:04:50,636 --> 01:04:52,220
You okay, Kevin?

711
01:04:57,310 --> 01:04:59,561
You know what, Mr. Fredricksen?

712
01:04:59,645 --> 01:05:02,522
The wilderness isn't quite
what I expected.

713
01:05:02,648 --> 01:05:04,232
Yeah? How so?

714
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:06,818
It's kind of wild.

715
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:10,572
I mean, it's not how they made
it sound in my book.

716
01:05:10,656 --> 01:05:12,574
Get used to that, kid.

717
01:05:12,658 --> 01:05:15,076
My dad made it sound so easy.

718
01:05:15,161 --> 01:05:17,245
He's really good at camping...

719
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:20,415
and how to make fire
from rocks and stuff.

720
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:23,210
He used to come to all
my Sweat Lodge meetings.

721
01:05:23,878 --> 01:05:27,172
And afterwards,
we'd go get ice cream at Fentons.

722
01:05:27,673 --> 01:05:30,425
I always get chocolate
and he gets butter brickle.

723
01:05:30,510 --> 01:05:33,470
Then we sit on this one curb
right outside,

724
01:05:33,554 --> 01:05:37,390
and I'll count all the blue cars
and he counts all the red ones,

725
01:05:37,517 --> 01:05:41,061
and whoever gets the most wins.

726
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:45,565
I like that curb.

727
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:50,570
That might sound boring,

728
01:05:51,239 --> 01:05:55,116
but I think the boring stuff
is the stuff I remember the most.

729
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:04,459
Look! There it is!

730
01:06:05,211 --> 01:06:08,630
Hey, kid. Hold on, Russell.
Stand still.

731
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:22,811
Look at that bird go.
Wait up, you overgrown chicken.

732
01:06:24,105 --> 01:06:27,566
That's it. Go, Kevin!
Go find your babies!

733
01:06:32,113 --> 01:06:33,947
Run, Kevin! Run!

734
01:06:36,784 --> 01:06:38,118
Oh, no!

735
01:06:43,332 --> 01:06:45,584
Russell, give me your knife!

736
01:06:47,587 --> 01:06:49,588
Get away from my bird!

737
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:16,990
No!

738
01:07:23,623 --> 01:07:24,914
No!

739
01:07:31,297 --> 01:07:34,174
Careful. We'll want her
in good shape for my return.

740
01:07:35,968 --> 01:07:38,887
Let her go! Stop!

741
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:44,643
Kevin!

742
01:07:58,366 --> 01:08:00,158
You gave away Kevin.

743
01:08:02,995 --> 01:08:05,830
You just gave her away.

744
01:08:07,667 --> 01:08:13,254
This is none of my concern.
I didn't ask for any of this!

745
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:18,677
Master, it's alright.

746
01:08:19,512 --> 01:08:21,388
I am not your master!

747
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:25,225
And if you hadn't have shown up,
none of this would've happened!

748
01:08:25,351 --> 01:08:27,602
Bad dog! Bad dog!

749
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:38,029
Now, whether you assist me or not,

750
01:08:38,531 --> 01:08:42,117
I am going to Paradise Falls
if it kills me.

751
01:09:54,273 --> 01:09:58,109
Here. I don't want this anymore.

752
01:13:38,664 --> 01:13:39,831
Russell?

753
01:13:44,837 --> 01:13:45,878
Russell!

754
01:13:46,004 --> 01:13:49,465
I'm gonna help Kevin,
even if you won't!

755
01:13:50,843 --> 01:13:52,844
No, Russell! No!

756
01:15:04,458 --> 01:15:05,500
Huh?

757
01:15:05,584 --> 01:15:06,751
Russell?

758
01:15:08,921 --> 01:15:10,046
Dug!

759
01:15:10,255 --> 01:15:14,884
I was hiding under your porch
because I love you. Can I stay?

760
01:15:14,968 --> 01:15:17,386
Can you stay?
Well, you're my dog, aren't you?

761
01:15:17,471 --> 01:15:18,805
And I'm your master.

762
01:15:18,931 --> 01:15:20,389
You're my master?

763
01:15:20,474 --> 01:15:21,808
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

764
01:15:21,934 --> 01:15:24,685
Good boy, Dug!
You're a good boy!

765
01:15:50,504 --> 01:15:51,629
Yes!

766
01:15:53,632 --> 01:15:55,466
Don't worry, Kevin. I'll save...

767
01:16:04,434 --> 01:16:09,438
And they wouldn't believe me.
Just wait till they get a look at you.

768
01:16:09,523 --> 01:16:10,773
Master?

769
01:16:11,191 --> 01:16:14,318
- The small mailman has returned.
- What?

770
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:16,320
Let me go.

771
01:16:18,323 --> 01:16:20,283
Where's your elderly friend?

772
01:16:21,994 --> 01:16:24,203
He's not my friend anymore.

773
01:16:24,705 --> 01:16:28,165
Well, if you're here,
Fredricksen can't be far behind.

774
01:16:29,167 --> 01:16:31,335
Where are you keeping Kevin?

775
01:16:32,504 --> 01:16:33,713
Let me go!

776
01:16:33,839 --> 01:16:36,007
Scream all you want,
small mailman.

777
01:16:36,133 --> 01:16:38,509
None of your mailman friends
can hear you.

778
01:16:39,177 --> 01:16:42,680
I'll unleash
all my Wilderness Explorer training!

779
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:48,185
Alpha,
Fredricksen's coming back.

780
01:16:48,312 --> 01:16:51,898
Guard that bird. If you see the old man,
you know what to do.

781
01:16:52,024 --> 01:16:55,318
Hey, where are you going?
I'm not finished with you!

782
01:16:55,402 --> 01:16:57,320
Nice talking with you.

783
01:17:00,532 --> 01:17:01,574
Ahhh!

784
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:04,368
Where are you, Fredricksen?

785
01:17:22,888 --> 01:17:24,221
Russell!

786
01:17:36,777 --> 01:17:39,403
- Mr. Fredricksen!
- Dug, bring her over!

787
01:17:41,281 --> 01:17:43,783
You came back for Kevin!
Let's go get her!

788
01:17:43,909 --> 01:17:46,077
I'm getting Kevin. You stay here.

789
01:17:46,203 --> 01:17:47,370
But I wanna help.

790
01:17:47,454 --> 01:17:48,746
I don't want your help.

791
01:17:48,872 --> 01:17:50,581
I want you safe.

792
01:17:57,756 --> 01:18:00,091
How do we get past these dogs?

793
01:18:00,467 --> 01:18:01,801
Point!

794
01:18:12,270 --> 01:18:13,437
Kevin.

795
01:18:14,648 --> 01:18:17,108
Don't worry, Kevin.
We're on our way.

796
01:18:17,609 --> 01:18:20,736
Allow no one to be entering
through these doors.

797
01:18:21,279 --> 01:18:23,823
Guard well that bird, my minions.

798
01:18:24,741 --> 01:18:26,158
What do we do now, Dug?

799
01:18:39,464 --> 01:18:41,298
Who wants the ball?

800
01:18:42,509 --> 01:18:44,301
- Me! I want it!
- Me! I do!

801
01:18:44,636 --> 01:18:46,012
- I want the ball!
- Give it to me!

802
01:18:46,138 --> 01:18:47,388
Then go get it!

803
01:18:47,472 --> 01:18:49,849
I'm gonna get there first!

804
01:18:49,975 --> 01:18:51,350
Getting the ball!

805
01:18:51,476 --> 01:18:52,935
I got it!

806
01:18:53,311 --> 01:18:54,311
Uh-oh.

807
01:18:58,150 --> 01:19:01,068
I'm sorry, Kevin.
Let's get you out of here.

808
01:19:01,153 --> 01:19:03,154
Master! He's gone!
The old man!

809
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:04,280
He's here!

810
01:19:04,364 --> 01:19:06,490
- He's got the bird!
- The bird's gone...

811
01:19:06,616 --> 01:19:08,617
Calm down! One at a time!

812
01:19:12,122 --> 01:19:14,874
I... want... to... help!

813
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Ha-ha!

814
01:19:25,510 --> 01:19:26,969
- He's in Hall D!
- He's in Hall C!

815
01:19:27,054 --> 01:19:28,512
It's the old man!

816
01:19:28,889 --> 01:19:31,932
Does anyone know where they are?

817
01:19:47,491 --> 01:19:49,742
Gray Leader?
Take down the house.

818
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:57,792
Gray Leader, checking in.

819
01:19:57,876 --> 01:19:58,876
Gray Two, checking in.

820
01:19:59,002 --> 01:20:00,169
Gray Three, checking in.

821
01:20:04,674 --> 01:20:06,008
Target sighted.

822
01:20:14,476 --> 01:20:16,018
Come on, Kevin.

823
01:20:23,318 --> 01:20:24,360
Arrggghh!

824
01:20:31,076 --> 01:20:32,243
Hi.

825
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:01,856
Any last words, Fredricksen?
Come on! Spit it out!

826
01:21:05,610 --> 01:21:07,862
- Come on.
- Enough!

827
01:21:08,196 --> 01:21:12,908
I am taking that bird back with me.
Alive or dead!

828
01:21:39,227 --> 01:21:40,895
Come on, Kevin.

829
01:22:00,123 --> 01:22:03,083
I will have many enjoyments
from what I am about to do, Dug.

830
01:22:11,468 --> 01:22:12,968
He wears the 'Cone of Shame'!

831
01:22:13,511 --> 01:22:16,931
What? Do not just continue sitting.
Attack!

832
01:22:20,018 --> 01:22:23,270
No, no! Stop your laughing!
Get this off of me!

833
01:22:23,355 --> 01:22:25,272
Listen, you dog. Sit!

834
01:22:26,858 --> 01:22:28,108
Yes, Alpha.

835
01:22:28,193 --> 01:22:30,819
Alpha? I am not Alpha.
He is...

836
01:22:31,196 --> 01:22:32,238
Oh!

837
01:22:33,865 --> 01:22:35,574
I can't do it.

838
01:22:37,911 --> 01:22:39,161
- Russell!
- Huh?

839
01:22:39,329 --> 01:22:42,748
Caw, caw! Raar!
Caw, caw! Raar!

840
01:22:43,667 --> 01:22:46,168
You leave Mr. Fredricksen alone!

841
01:23:02,894 --> 01:23:04,770
Hey, squirrel!

842
01:23:04,854 --> 01:23:06,855
Squirrel? Where?
Where? Where?

843
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:08,274
Where's the squirrel?

844
01:23:12,112 --> 01:23:13,779
I hate squirrels.

845
01:23:34,467 --> 01:23:35,551
Dug!

846
01:23:36,052 --> 01:23:37,261
Master!

847
01:23:38,305 --> 01:23:41,640
Russell! Over here! Let's go!

848
01:23:46,479 --> 01:23:48,314
Mr. Fredricksen!

849
01:23:48,898 --> 01:23:50,524
Go on, Kevin!

850
01:24:05,457 --> 01:24:06,582
No!

851
01:24:21,431 --> 01:24:23,766
Russell! Get out of there!

852
01:24:25,769 --> 01:24:27,895
No! Leave them alone!

853
01:24:43,203 --> 01:24:47,373
Russell, hang on to Kevin!
Don't let go of her!

854
01:24:49,459 --> 01:24:51,543
Kevin! Chocolate!

855
01:25:14,067 --> 01:25:15,692
That was cool!

856
01:25:17,737 --> 01:25:22,116
Don't jerk around so much, kid!
Easy, Russell.

857
01:25:24,411 --> 01:25:26,912
Oh, I am ready to not be up high.

858
01:25:50,270 --> 01:25:52,938
Sorry about your house,
Mr. Fredricksen.

859
01:25:55,567 --> 01:25:58,360
You know, it's just a house.

860
01:26:06,411 --> 01:26:08,579
Look at you. You're so soft.

861
01:26:11,166 --> 01:26:12,749
Aw!

862
01:26:12,834 --> 01:26:14,626
I wish I could keep one.

863
01:26:19,007 --> 01:26:21,049
Where's my cane?
I just had it here.

864
01:26:29,309 --> 01:26:32,644
You know what? Keep them.
A little gift from me to you.

865
01:26:33,521 --> 01:26:35,063
Bye, Kevin!

866
01:26:44,491 --> 01:26:45,782
Ready?

867
01:26:46,159 --> 01:26:47,493
Ready.

868
01:26:58,254 --> 01:27:00,005
And by receiving their badges,

869
01:27:00,089 --> 01:27:04,760
the following Explorers will
graduate to Senior Explorers.

870
01:27:05,136 --> 01:27:08,972
For Extreme Mountaineering Lore.
Congratulations, Jimmy.

871
01:27:09,224 --> 01:27:13,685
For Wild Animal Defensive Arts.
Congratulations, Brandon.

872
01:27:14,187 --> 01:27:16,355
For Assisting the Elderly...

873
01:27:17,190 --> 01:27:20,359
Uh, Russell,
is there someone that...

874
01:27:23,112 --> 01:27:26,198
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Old man coming through.

875
01:27:29,035 --> 01:27:30,536
I'm here for him.

876
01:27:30,745 --> 01:27:32,996
Congratulations, Russell. Sir.

877
01:27:36,167 --> 01:27:39,253
Russell, for Assisting the Elderly...

878
01:27:39,712 --> 01:27:43,924
and for performing above
and beyond the call of duty,

879
01:27:44,884 --> 01:27:49,179
I would like to award you
the highest honor I can bestow.

880
01:27:51,558 --> 01:27:53,308
The Ellie badge.

881
01:27:56,312 --> 01:27:57,396
Wow.

882
01:28:02,110 --> 01:28:04,611
All right,
I think that covers everybody.

883
01:28:04,696 --> 01:28:06,738
So let's give a big Explorer call...

884
01:28:07,031 --> 01:28:10,534
to our brand new
Senior Wilderness Explorers.

885
01:28:10,785 --> 01:28:11,910
Ready, everybody?

886
01:28:11,995 --> 01:28:13,537
Caw, caw! Raar!
Caw, caw! Raar!

887
01:28:20,587 --> 01:28:22,296
- Blue one.
- Red one.

888
01:28:22,964 --> 01:28:24,756
- Blue one.
- Gray one.

889
01:28:25,717 --> 01:28:27,718
- Red one.
- That's a bike.

890
01:28:28,136 --> 01:28:29,803
It's red, isn't it?

891
01:28:29,887 --> 01:28:31,763
Mr. Fredricksen,
you're cheating.

892
01:28:31,973 --> 01:28:33,765
No, I'm not. Red one.

893
01:28:33,850 --> 01:28:35,642
That's a fire hydrant.

894
01:28:37,770 --> 01:28:39,813
Maybe I need new glasses.

895
01:28:40,148 --> 01:29:03,045
Another blue one.
