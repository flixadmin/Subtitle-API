1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,976
- Previously on "Gotham"...
- What's you record

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,801
for how many banks
you've robbed in one day?

3
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:08,290
You're playing a dangerous game, Lee.

4
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:09,696
My job is to make sure

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,126
that the people of the Narrows are safe.

6
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:13,410
I will do everything
in my power to ensure that.

7
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,800
I'm looking for Ed Nygma.

8
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,720
Five banks were robbed last night.

9
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,750
Why don't you try going
after the real criminals?

10
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:20,196
Making money off the backs of the poor.

11
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,860
Like Gotham Savings and Loan?

12
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,490
- You are a fool!
- Come out with your hands up!

13
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:29,676
- I expected you might come, Captain.
- There's two of them.

14
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,380
What if he's nuttier than the other one?

15
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,696
I'm nothing like Jerome.

16
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,600
I'm gonna drive you mad.

17
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,840
But don't worry, all of Gotham
will be joining you.

18
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:38,310
- Hands up!
- Bombs away!

19
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:40,940
I'm more than a man. I'm an idea.

20
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,320
And I will live on in the shadows

21
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,780
within Gotham's discontent.

22
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:51,950
Burn it down, brother.

23
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,730
Brothers and sisters,

24
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,700
let's raise a glass
to our fallen leader.

25
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,800
To Jerome!

26
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:11,770
To Jerome!

27
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,190
This affair is invitation only.

28
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,800
Well, that's all right.
You're welcome to stay.

29
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,180
But you won't be leaving.

30
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,550
Ow!

31
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:55,470
Why so sad, bozos?

32
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:58,420
Did you think they could
get rid of me so easily?

33
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:02,590
Well, okay, so they did.

34
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:05,590
I'm dead. But let's not
dwell on negatives.

35
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,400
I have one last party to throw.

36
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:10,740
First on the to-do list:

37
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:12,990
Dig me up.

38
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:15,790
Dig me up!

39
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,630
Come on, clowns!

40
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,260
Dig him up!

41
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,630
Get Jerome!

42
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:24,000
We're gonna dig you up, Jerome!
You hear me?

43
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,600
Come on out of there!

44
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,370
Come on, dig, dig, dig!

45
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:32,490

46
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,560
What are you gonna do?

47
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,900
What can I do?

48
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,570
The back door is just down
that hallway, right there.

49
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,270
I'm not letting her go, Harvey.

50
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:58,970
Why not? I'm the only one here,

51
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:01,560
and I'm really good at
looking the other way, partner.

52
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,710
Not this time.

53
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:05,270
She robbed a dirty bank.

54
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:08,280
People get away with a lot
worse in Gotham every day.

55
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,230
Doesn't make it right.

56
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:13,800
We got away with worse. Both of us.

57
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,640
Get out of here.

58
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,730
- What?
- I don't need that crap

59
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,770
thrown in my face right now.
Get out of here!

60
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,790
Well, you finally nabbed me, copper.

61
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,200
What the hell, Lee?

62
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,550
I don't suppose
this is where anyone expected

63
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:46,200
our story to end.

64
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:49,020
So it's ending?

65
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:52,170
Hard to imagine what's left.

66
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,440
I want to help you.

67
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,210
How?

68
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,480
Give up Nygma, return the money,

69
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,680
and ask the D.A.
for supervised probation.

70
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,470
I'm not betraying my friend.

71
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,290
They can call you The Doc.

72
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:11,590
You can rob banks, fight
gangsters, but I know you.

73
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,850
You're Lee Thompkins, and all this?
This is just a...

74
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:17,900
way of helping people.

75
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,040
I understand that.

76
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,700
Who doesn't want to be Robin Hood?

77
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:23,440
But you're still breaking the law.

78
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,610
Jim, you wish you could do
what I'm doing.

79
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:28,040
Helping people without the straitjacket

80
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,710
of the law... as if the law
means anything in Gotham.

81
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,260
If the law has lost its meaning,

82
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,560
it's because people like you
are turning your back on it.

83
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,280
I am fighting back.

84
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,150
I don't deny anything I've done.

85
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,406
You want to send me to Blackgate?

86
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,470
- Go ahead.
- I don't want to send you to Blackgate!

87
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,806
That's the last thing I want to do.

88
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,966
Don't you know I wish I could
let you walk out that door,

89
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:45,990
turn my head?

90
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,460
What's holding you back?

91
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,500
Maybe if you let me go,
you'd let yourself go, too.

92
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,340
So many things I wish I could change.

93
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,440
Things I've done.

94
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,950
Jim?

95
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:17,720
Sorry to stick my face in your business.

96
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,850
Something just came up.

97
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:23,850
I've already inspected it for
booby traps. It's clear.

98
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:26,090
- Well, that's a relief.
- I've taken the liberty

99
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:28,200
of setting up a monitor in your office.

100
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:40,720
You don't think he might
still be alive, do you?

101
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,840
What were the autopsy results, Lucius?

102
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,240
Dead when he came in.

103
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,820
More dead when he was eviscerated

104
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:47,380
and his brain was sliced up.

105
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,850
Hello, Jimmy!

106
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,720
If you're watching this,

107
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,550
things must not have gone well for me.

108
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:56,220
Hmm. Shucks.

109
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:59,460
I can only pray I gave as good as I got

110
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,160
and left ample carnage in my wake.

111
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,830
But I don't want to fixate
on disappointments.

112
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:10,240
Jimmy, I have one last
teensy request for you.

113
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:14,040
I want you to throw me a wake

114
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:17,240
at the GCPD.

115
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:20,080
Don't worry about the guest list.

116
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,320
I've already sent the invitations.

117
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:27,220
I don't like the sound of that.

118
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:40,430
Is everybody ready?

119
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,240
Lock down everything now.

120
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,710
Everybody, listen up! Lock it down!

121
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:50,510
Lock it down now!

122
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,520
The Doc's taken care of us.

123
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,550
It's time for us to take care of her!

124
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,346
Let's go down there
and bust her out of jail.

125
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,846
No one cares about
the fate of Lee Thompkins

126
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,270
more than me. Is that understood?

127
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,410
Which is exactly why I will not have you

128
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,580
bumbling into the GCPD en masse.

129
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:25,010
So we're gonna let her rot?

130
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:28,780
Leave her in the sweaty palms
of Jim Gordon?

131
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,450
I would sooner debate you all
on teleology versus deontology

132
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,590
than leave her
with that overgrown Boy Scout.

133
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,960
- Teleo... Huh? Geez.
- What?

134
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:37,860
My point exactly.
Look, if I had it my way,

135
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,476
Jim Gordon would be
off the field of play

136
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,620
once and for all, but Lee insists

137
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,640
that I employ only nonlethal means.

138
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,500
So, I and my brilliant crack team

139
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,280
will liberate Lee Thompkins
with surgical precision.

140
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:51,140
You stay here. Team, we have everything?

141
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,140
- Bicycle pump? Can opener?
- Right here.

142
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,510
Primer cord? Pickle jar?

143
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:56,810
Fishing rod?

144
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:59,680
Fabulous.
Okay, you four, you're with me.

145
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:02,040
You, go where Jim Gordon goes.

146
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,400
He comes under some harm, assist him.

147
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,596
I do not need Lee blaming me

148
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,736
if he's killed under friendly fire

149
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,320
while I go about my business. Okay?

150
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,406
All right, team. Follow my plan,
and we'll be back here

151
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,840
to finish counting this
in just a few hours.

152
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,170
Keep it up.

153
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,800
Breaking Lee out's
gonna be a piece of cake.

154
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:19,500
Hello? Wayne Manor.

155
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,730
Alfred, it's Gordon.

156
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:21,900
Where's Bruce?

157
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:24,251
Well, he's meeting with Jeremiah
about the energy project.

158
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,350
Something amiss?

159
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,170
He's meeting with Jeremiah Valeska?

160
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,010
Yes, that's right. Now you can tell me

161
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,760
why you sound so concerned.

162
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:33,310
Jerome's followers are rampaging
outside the station.

163
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,690
Oh, I see.

164
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,020
Are Master Bruce

165
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,220
and Jeremiah in any danger?

166
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:39,400
It's hard to say.

167
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,850
But right now, Jeremiah's maze

168
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,740
may actually be
the safest place for them.

169
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:44,890
Right. I shall head there nonetheless.

170
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,930
Thank you very much.

171
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:00,770
What's the plan?

172
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,010
Open up the armory.

173
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,550
Now you're talking. Guys!

174
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:18,540
Jim, hey! Hey, Jim!

175
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,306
You figure out where
we're gonna hit 'em yet?

176
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:22,890
- We're not.
- Say what?

177
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,460
You know how Jerome works.

178
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,160
Dead or alive, he uses distractions.

179
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,616
So what, we're gonna
just let 'em come in

180
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,816
through the front door and party?

181
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,070
This wake is just intended
to distract us

182
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,646
while his followers hit the real target.

183
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:34,720
Which is?

184
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:36,206
Well, we're never gonna figure that out

185
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:38,146
if we're inside fighting off
these maniacs, are we?

186
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:40,370
Look, they come in
the front door, right?

187
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,300
We fall back, get a few
shots off, make it look good.

188
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,540
Meanwhile, the entire
precinct sneaks out

189
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,340
this old service door
as quickly as possible.

190
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:49,780
I can't believe you're gonna
run away from these asses.

191
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:52,610
Once we're outside, we surround
the building, cordon it off.

192
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:55,150
- And then we trap 'em all inside.
- Correct.

193
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:56,620
They blow off some steam...

194
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:58,990
We hit 'em with tear gas
and knock a few heads.

195
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:01,170
Yeah. Course,
we still have to figure out

196
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,260
what the real target is.

197
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:03,690
Got a plan for that?

198
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:08,160
I do. It's a little sketchy
right now, but... Come on.

199
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,430
All right, listen up, people!

200
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,170
Here's the plan.

201
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,440
Jeremiah, I didn't think you could get

202
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,240
the generator program
working so quickly.

203
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,310
You ready for a demonstration?

204
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,910
Okay.

205
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:25,740
You hit that switch there,
and the facility

206
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,100
will be disconnected
from the power grid.

207
00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:00,110
Ambient energy.

208
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:03,210
No cables or wires of any kind.

209
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:05,670
It's clean and stable.

210
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:08,940
Harvested from microtremors
and air density shifts. It's...

211
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,150
It's virtually without costs.

212
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,666
And with the prototypes at Wayne Labs,

213
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:17,200
we could power all of Gotham?

214
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,070
You've kept this project a secret, yes?

215
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:24,830
No one outside of Wayne
Industries knows it exists.

216
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:29,220
It's the ones who are closest to you

217
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:32,460
that you have to keep your eye on.

218
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,750
I know better than anyone.

219
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:41,150
Arkham Asylum sent me
Jerome's personal effects.

220
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,290
And amongst them,

221
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:44,130
I found his diary.

222
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,940
It's a catalog of his
fantasies and goals.

223
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:56,770
Every twisted vision he ever had.

224
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:05,110
Maybe you shouldn't spend
so much time reading it.

225
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,250
He was obsessed with
torturing and murdering

226
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:09,460
me, James Gordon, and you.

227
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:11,950
And if he had been just
the least bit sane,

228
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:14,680
he would have destroyed us all.

229
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:17,990
And Gotham would be in ruin.

230
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,210
Your brother is dead, Jeremiah.

231
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:29,140
It's time for you to come out of
this bunker and join the world.

232
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,180
Yes.

233
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,850
Yes, he's dead.

234
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:40,580
I still have trouble believing it.

235
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,350
Who is that?

236
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,950
It's just Alfred.

237
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:50,350
- Yeah?
- Oh, Master Bruce,

238
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:52,160
I've got some rather disturbing news.

239
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:55,200
Jerome Valeska's acolytes
are kicking off again.

240
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,870
Yes.

241
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,370
Thank you, Alfred.

242
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,590
I'm on my way.

243
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:10,280
Lunch plans.

244
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:14,240
That was a lie.

245
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,520
You're lying to me, Bruce?

246
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:25,030
You're right. I'm sorry.

247
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:31,150
It seems some of Jerome's
followers are causing trouble.

248
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:33,500
Oh, my God.

249
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,440
I was right.

250
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:38,970
No, Jeremiah...

251
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:41,780
I was right. He's not dead.

252
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:43,480
Bruce, he's not dead.

253
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:45,110
He's alive, and he's coming after me!

254
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:17,990
Jeremiah, easy.

255
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:19,280
Easy.

256
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,320
You're not thinking clearly.

257
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:23,500
Come on, this isn't like you.

258
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,560
Bruce.

259
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:30,170
Bruce, I need to tell you something.

260
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,470
After Jerome died,

261
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:34,690
he left one last final trap for me.

262
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:41,120
He sprayed me with his insanity gas.

263
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,140
"Special mixture,

264
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:46,140
just for you, brother," he said.

265
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,740
I can't stop seeing him...

266
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:59,430
clawing his way out
of his grave, coming for me.

267
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,360
And even though I know it's not real,

268
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:04,130
it... feels real.

269
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,130
And I can't control myself.

270
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,860
What if...

271
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:13,430
What if I could show you
he's dead and buried?

272
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,400
How?

273
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:20,410
We go there, to his grave.

274
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:23,350
- No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- Jeremiah, listen to me.

275
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:25,530
Your brother took away your
greatest strength, your mind,

276
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,260
and turned it into a trap.

277
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,740
But if you can see the reality,

278
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,390
you can be freed from that trap.

279
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:39,890
You really think that would work?

280
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,150
I do.

281
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:48,500
Then I'll try.

282
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:52,140
You're a good friend, Bruce.

283
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:06,730
We're getting you and
the other prisoners out of here.

284
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,396
What were you trying
to tell me before, Jim?

285
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,806
There's a van outside
waiting for transfer.

286
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:12,390
- Don't ignore me.
- I just want to get you safe first.

287
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:13,930
Come to the Narrows.

288
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,270
- What?
- Where you can make

289
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,830
a real difference in this city.

290
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:19,630
You can make up your own
rules about how to do it.

291
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,910
Alvarez, get them out of here.

292
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,590
Go.

293
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,090
Don't shoot.

294
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,860
Hold your fire.

295
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,110
There's too many of 'em! Fall back!

296
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:03,510
Fall back!

297
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:05,530
- Fall back!
- That's him!

298
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,310
He killed Jerome!

299
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,320
Gordon!

300
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:18,660
Stay together! Stay together!

301
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:22,490
Let's go! Let's go!

302
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:33,000
Well, look at us.

303
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:36,730
We caught ourselves
Captain James Gordon.

304
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:40,950
Assassin of Jerome Valeska.

305
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,250
Hi, guys.

306
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:44,350
Oh, don't try and get
chummy with us, Gordon.

307
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:46,950
We're gonna carve you up.

308
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:49,990
Yeah. No, I wasn't talking to you.
I was talking to them.

309
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,230
Hey, man, you like to dance?

310
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:59,200
Let's, you and me, talk outside.
What do you say?

311
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,960
- Still no answer.
- Then something's wrong.

312
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,210
We should go.

313
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,830
He was on his way to your office.

314
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,950
He'll wait for us there.

315
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,720
What was that?

316
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,730
We're almost there.

317
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,450
Just a quick look and we'll leave.

318
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,480
Bruce.

319
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,390
Bruce.

320
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,560
I don't know if I can do this.

321
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:56,240
Just a little further.

322
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:09,810
Oh, God, no.

323
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,300
His followers must have dug him up.

324
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:14,410
He's alive.

325
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,450
- I knew it. I knew it.
- We have to get out of here.

326
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,150
He's alive!

327
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:23,650
Jeremiah! Jeremiah!

328
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:45,060
How much longer are these petty
aggressions going to continue?!

329
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:46,980
There's nothing petty
about my aggression.

330
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,350
So, am I to starve

331
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:51,550
until I guess the source
of your resentment?

332
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:56,990
You said, if I joined you,
we'd be back on top.

333
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:59,390
Instead, we're grubbing for Jerome

334
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:00,820
and we got played by Nygma.

335
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:05,230
You said, if I joined you,
you'd find me a cure.

336
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:07,530
And yet...

337
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,100
I admit that...

338
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,970
through no fault of my own,

339
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:17,320
our advancement has not run apace.

340
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:18,680
"Not run apace"?!

341
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:21,110
We're squatting in Falcone's mansion!

342
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:23,780
We're knocking over liquor
stores to pay for groceries!

343
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,880
Meanwhile, everyone else
is carving up Sofia's territory.

344
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:29,720
We are lying in wait,
building a nest egg,

345
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:33,360
while less deliberate players
show us their cards.

346
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:38,860
If you don't find me Hugo
Strange and get me cured,

347
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,980
I am going to crush your windpipe

348
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,570
- like a beer can.
- Shh!

349
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:44,000
Did you just shush me?

350
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,840
Shush! I sense an opportunity here.

351
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:48,316
Live to Jennifer Luree.

352
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,920
In a twist that Jerome Valeska
himself could have thought of,

353
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:53,710
the GCPD are laying siege
to Central Precinct

354
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:55,310
while Valeska's followers

355
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:57,810
hold a wake for
their deceased role model.

356
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,580
- How is that an opportunity?
- Confusion is always

357
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:02,890
an opportunity for the clear-headed.

358
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:05,590
Someone is showing their cards, Butch.

359
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:08,460
Let's go take a peek.

360
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:18,910
You may recall what happened here

361
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,400
after the Arkham Asylum breakout...

362
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:24,340
One to the east, one to the west.
Let's go, let's go.

363
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:26,790
- Is he talking yet?
- I don't know.

364
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:29,280
- Let's check.
- Long live Jerome!

365
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,220
All right. One more time, sunshine.

366
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,450
Did Jerome leave any other instructions?

367
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:36,850
I'll never...

368
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:37,920
Harvey, Harvey.

369
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,420
Reporters, buddy.

370
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,960
All right, look,
this is how it's gonna go.

371
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,940
You're gonna start talking,

372
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:50,580
or I'm gonna stop caring whether
you can talk. You got it?

373
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:54,840
Ow! Ow! I'll talk!

374
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,340
I'll talk.

375
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,310
It's too late, anyways.

376
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:00,780
They're already dead.

377
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,180
Who? Who's dead?

378
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:06,960
Jeremiah and Bruce Wayne.

379
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,120
- You think he's telling the truth?
- I'm gonna find out.

380
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,690
They're at Jeremiah's bunker.

381
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,990
You hold down the fort here?

382
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:15,870
Long live Jerome!

383
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:27,640
Trouble, Mr. Riddler?

384
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,410
A complication, yes.

385
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:32,310
Hostiles take over the station.

386
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:34,590
Police will have removed the prisoners.

387
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:36,380
Where are they?

388
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,450
Oh, yes.

389
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:45,230
Oh, this might be
easier than I expected.

390
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:51,490
The Riddler! We're saved!

391
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,160
How did you get out?

392
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:55,200
Uh, through the old service door.

393
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,560
The old service door.

394
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:02,170
- What do we do now?
- Now we improvise.

395
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,586
They're gonna use tear gas in here soon.

396
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:06,640
I have to get in first.
We need a costume shop. Quick!

397
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,670
Penguin!

398
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,350
We're saved!

399
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:16,170
That one.

400
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,550
Jerome...

401
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:21,360
No. Not the...

402
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:24,460
You ever get tired of being wrong?

403
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,540
Jerome is in the house!
Jerome is in the house!

404
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:11,790
Jeremiah!

405
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:15,260
We need to leave! It's not safe!

406
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,970
You believe me now?

407
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,480
Jerome's alive.

408
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:23,290
No. His followers dug
him up. They're sick!

409
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:26,790
They're also dangerous
and they might be nearby.

410
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:30,290
How can I trust you if
you won't believe me?

411
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,260
You can trust me
because I'm your friend.

412
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,020
I want you to be my friend, Bruce.

413
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,160
You don't know what it was like...

414
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,590
living underground all those years.

415
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:51,800
And then you came along

416
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:54,110
and offered me everything
I could dream of.

417
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:57,260
Because I believe in you, Jeremiah.

418
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,320
We're gonna do great things for Gotham.

419
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:02,040
We could.

420
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,790
We really could.

421
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:08,350
I thought we would.

422
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,800
There's no reason to stop thinking that.

423
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,170
All we have to do is get out of here.

424
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:21,840
First, all we had to do
was come to the cemetery.

425
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,750
Now all we have to do is leave?

426
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:28,550
See, that's very confusing to me.

427
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:30,490
So, tell me again,

428
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:33,030
Bruce...

429
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:35,840
why'd you really bring me here?

430
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:38,800
I thought it would help.

431
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,860
I was wrong, but we need to leave.

432
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:42,560
What the hell are you doing?!

433
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,956
You think I didn't know
what was happening

434
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:46,220
from the moment
you suggested coming here?

435
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,746
Jeremiah, what are you talking about?

436
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:50,210
Stop pretending to be my friend!

437
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,780
I know what's really happening.

438
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,040
You can fool everyone else...

439
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,610
but I know you made a switch.

440
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,800
And you can't hide,

441
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:05,220
not even behind that new face of yours.

442
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:08,960
I know it's you.

443
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:12,800
I know it's you, Jerome.

444
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,400
Jeremiah, give me the gun.

445
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,970
Turn around, brother.

446
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:24,170
I said turn around!

447
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,370
You killed my friend Bruce.

448
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:29,710
Now it's time to put you
back in your grave.

449
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,810
Walk!

450
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,630
Come on, chug it.

451
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,880
Chug!

452
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:46,880
All the way! Yeah!

453
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:48,800
Wait.

454
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,570
Uh, oh.

455
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,640
Ed.

456
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:34,360
Bruce?

457
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:37,330
Jeremiah?

458
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:13,320
Just a little bit further, brother,

459
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:15,320
then you'll be back in your grave.

460
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,260
You're stronger than this, Jeremiah.

461
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:19,560
You know these ideas are just
the insanity gas talking.

462
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:22,260
I won't let your lies
fool me any longer!

463
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:29,340
Wh-What's happening?

464
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,410
Hi-ya, Jimbo.

465
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,740
Jerome.

466
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:38,780
Ah, don't bother talking to me.

467
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:40,910
This is a recorded message.

468
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,250
And, plus... I'm still dead.

469
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:46,490
Just more posthumous fun.

470
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:48,860
Look, I knew you'd see through

471
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:51,320
all those shenanigans at the station.

472
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:55,200
I'd given all my fans
a script for them to follow.

473
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,380
See?

474
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,580
I wanted to bring you here.

475
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,870
Oh.

476
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,440
Now do you believe I'm not your brother?

477
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,000
Jeremiah, listen to me!

478
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:19,650
Jerome's followers are doing this!

479
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:21,790
Nothing else makes sense.

480
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:24,550
He sent them instructions
to torment you.

481
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:28,330
A fake. Yes.

482
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:31,030
I can see quite clearly where
you cut off poor Bruce's face

483
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,500
and stitched on your own.

484
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:33,990
But...

485
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:36,400
I am a man of science.

486
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:42,160
So let's have some evidence, huh?

487
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,110
Hmm?

488
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:49,820
Oh, don't mind her.

489
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:51,620
She's just here to make sure there's

490
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:53,520
no talking during the movie.

491
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:56,860
And trust me, you're gonna
want to pay attention

492
00:29:56,890 --> 00:30:00,120
so the twist makes sense at the end.

493
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,980
Hold still, brother.

494
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:19,780
Let's peel off that grotesque facade.

495
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:20,950
Come on.

496
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,010
Ecco.

497
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:08,620
I tell ya...

498
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:13,070
suicide really takes it out of a guy.

499
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,890
What is this?

500
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,510
Ah.

501
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:36,030
Jeremiah! Do not let
him turn you into him!

502
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,630
Do not let Jerome win this battle.

503
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,430
Jerome beat me?

504
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,060
That'll be the day.

505
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:45,620
No!

506
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,090
No!

507
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,770
Long live Jerome!

508
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:54,230
Long live Jerome! Long live Jerome!

509
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:57,180
Jerome is victorious at last!

510
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,420
Jerome victorious?

511
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:14,360
Are you serious?

512
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:17,850
He's dead.

513
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,920
Haven't you been paying attention?

514
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:36,080
Thank God I'm done with that.

515
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:54,540
I am the one who's victorious.

516
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:58,220
Jerome is dead.

517
00:32:58,290 --> 00:32:59,970
Is dead... is dead.

518
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,640
Long live... love live me.

519
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:05,980
Long live me.

520
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,170
Look, Bruce.

521
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,770
Like everything Jerome set his mind to,

522
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,570
his insanity gas failed.

523
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,980
Other than some...

524
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:27,330
mild cosmetic effects,

525
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:30,130
he might as well
have sprayed me with water.

526
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:34,630
You all need to see Jerome
for the utter dud that he was,

527
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:38,520
so I donned the mask of madness

528
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:40,740
to show you how feeble that is

529
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,140
compared to actual greatness.

530
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:51,260
Behold, the face of true sanity.

531
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,390
But... looks aren't everything.

532
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:58,590
I have a compendium

533
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:02,120
of Jerome's obsessions and goals, and...

534
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:04,730
I will outdo every one of them.

535
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:09,160
Jerome wanted to turn Gotham
into a madhouse.

536
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:15,010
But... to truly build something,

537
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:19,300
you must first tear down
what is already there.

538
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,940
I apologize for the deception, Jim.

539
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:25,200
I needed to ape Jerome
in order to persuade

540
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:27,960
his followers to throw
that macabre celebration

541
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:29,490
at your police station.

542
00:34:30,990 --> 00:34:35,430
They are a pathetic lot,
but not without their uses.

543
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:40,410
Ah, sidebar.

544
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:43,200
That is a self-perpetuating generator.

545
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:46,760
It can store
a phenomenal amount of energy.

546
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:50,640
I would hate to be within a mile
of it if it were to...

547
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:52,179
overload.

548
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:57,720
Jeremiah, the gas worked.

549
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:59,770
Think about it: You want to carry out

550
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:02,620
Jerome's crazy plan sanely?

551
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,790
What could be madder than that?

552
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:06,090
Madder?

553
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:08,380
Let's see.

554
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:10,670
Ah. Here, for example.

555
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:13,750
Jerome wanted to slather you in honey

556
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,060
and have you eaten alive
by corpse beetles.

557
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:19,570
Now, that's mad.

558
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:22,710
Me, if I want to kill you,
I'll just do it.

559
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:25,920
I'll shoot you in the head.

560
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:29,020
Simply and sanely.

561
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,330
Jeremiah.

562
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:34,520
But I don't want to kill you.

563
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,290
Come on!

564
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:38,860
Are you gonna listen?

565
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:41,430
Or you gonna behave like children?

566
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:44,140
See, I don't want to kill you,

567
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:48,340
because I want to show you
how much I've changed things.

568
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:51,110
How much we've changed things.

569
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:53,640
'Cause I could not have done any of this

570
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,980
without your help.

571
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:00,410
My help?

572
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,950
That sound you are hearing...

573
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:07,560
that is a very bad sound.

574
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:14,730
One which I'm afraid makes you
something of a guinea pig, Jim.

575
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,350
I feel very indebted to you, Bruce.

576
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:18,600
See...

577
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,500
those generators
that we built with your money,

578
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:25,600
they work even better as bombs.

579
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:30,010
Killing you will help secure
the loyalty of Jerome's minions,

580
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:33,650
and, well, that is that.

581
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:37,550
Good-bye.

582
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:40,130
All right, everybody, listen up!

583
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:43,120
You know what to do!
Let's go get our house back!

584
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,880
That's one down.

585
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,620
Jim Gordon is dead.

586
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,590
No! No!

587
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:16,530
Yes, Bruce.

588
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:20,160
Sorry, but progress requires sacrifice.

589
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,870
I'm going to stop you.

590
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:24,570
I really hope you don't try.

591
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,560
I would hate to have to kill you.

592
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:30,540
In fact, I can honestly say...

593
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:35,520
you are my very best friend.

594
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:02,740
What I want to know...

595
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:06,510
with a minimum of fuss,

596
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:10,810
is what you and your cohort
were really up to today.

597
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:14,580
I'll never betray the memory of Jer...

598
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:17,110
Shh. Wouldn't dream of it.

599
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:21,820
I don't expect you to betray
the memory of that old corpse.

600
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:24,100
I want you to betray whomever it is

601
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,730
you are currently following.

602
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:32,230
Long live Jerome.

603
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:33,330
He's not talking.

604
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,660
Is that so?

605
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:38,860
You staring at me?

606
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,820
Yeah, I get it.

607
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:46,330
Sometimes I...

608
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:49,700
accidentally catch a glimpse
of myself in the mirror, and...

609
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:52,040
it scares me, too.

610
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:54,440
And then I get angry.

611
00:38:56,020 --> 00:39:00,120
The longer I'm like this,
the angrier I get.

612
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:04,920
And right now, the way I see it,

613
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:09,390
you are preventing me
from finding a cure.

614
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:12,260
And that...

615
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:16,930
makes me very, very angry.

616
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:19,000
Is your plan

617
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:23,670
to gain his sympathy
by reciting your tale of woe?

618
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:24,970
Nah.

619
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:26,476
Just wanted to see if I could get him

620
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,840
to pee his pants a little in terror.

621
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:31,100
You want me to

622
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:33,210
shove some chicken bones
up his nose till he squawks?

623
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:35,600
Yes. That will do.

624
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,300
No.

625
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:38,940
Let's make this quick.

626
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,070
- No. No.
- Tilt your head back.

627
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,550
- Here comes the wishbone train!
- No. No, no, wait!

628
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,480
Smartest man in Gotham.

629
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,850
And you let your heart do the thinking.

630
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:55,490
Wake up, Ed.

631
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:57,350
Ow.

632
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:59,330
Were you awake the whole time?

633
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,040
Maybe.

634
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:02,680
Smartest man in Gotham, huh?

635
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:05,930
All right, get up. Up, up, up, up.

636
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:08,800
There are better things
to aspire to, you know.

637
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:11,370
I'm aspiring to them very much.

638
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,770
Just be yourself.

639
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:17,440
The guy who can let go
of the past and change.

640
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,310
I like that guy.

641
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:22,220
All right, now, how are we
gonna get past these psychos?

642
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:23,806
I'm assuming you brought
one of those for me?

643
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:27,370
Oh. Now, I would be into that,
but they only had one.

644
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:29,100
Instead...

645
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:32,360
the cavalry should be coming very soon.

646
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:33,970
Great.

647
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,830
Round 'em up!

648
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:10,640
Move, move, move! Let's go, let's go.

649
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,290
Okay.

650
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:33,270
Don't just wrap me
around your finger, Lee.

651
00:41:33,370 --> 00:41:35,670
Come on. Let's run.

652
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,090
Where's my phone call?

653
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,950
That's for taking a leak on my desk.

654
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:48,580
What a mess.

655
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,420
You know, it's funny,
it kind of reminds me

656
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,220
of my first apartment in Crown Point.

657
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:53,850
How long ago was that?

658
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,690
I still live there.

659
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:57,120
Harvey.

660
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:59,490
I found the epicenter of that explosion.

661
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:02,660
It's Jeremiah's bunker.

662
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:05,100
That's where Jim was going
to look for Bruce.

663
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:13,690
Good evening, gentlemen.

664
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,740
Hey there, Mr. Valeska.

665
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,050
You alone, or you got
Mr. Wayne with you?

666
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:20,230
No Mr. Wayne.

667
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:23,850
But I'm not alone.

668
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,930
What the hell?!

669
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:55,290
Look at these.

670
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:58,730
The gifts of true friendship.

671
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:02,090
Let's load them on the trucks.

672
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:06,970
It's time to give Gotham City
its new face.

673
00:43:13,110 --> 00:43:17,780
