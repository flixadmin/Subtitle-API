1
00:00:41,417 --> 00:00:42,501
Stop!

2
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:48,466
OK!

3
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:57,850
—How are you?
—Very well. How are you?

4
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,019
Your ID, please.

5
00:01:00,979 --> 00:01:02,438
Certainly.

6
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:26,879
Give me that.

7
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:31,425
How many times have I told you
not to throw the ball over there?

8
00:01:31,509 --> 00:01:33,511
Are you trying
to scare your sister or what?

9
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:35,179
—She’s crying.
—Of course she’s crying.

10
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:36,848
Don’t you see she’s just a baby?

11
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:38,808
You yourself were a baby
not too long ago.

12
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:40,225
Yes, Dad.

13
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:42,020
—What’s wrong?
—Nothing.

14
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:45,314
What’s wrong, Juan Pablo?

15
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:47,107
I want her to die.

16
00:01:49,986 --> 00:01:51,612
Never say that.

17
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:58,744
We are a family and we have
to look out for each other, always.

18
00:01:58,828 --> 00:02:00,412
You hear me?

19
00:02:14,093 --> 00:02:17,346
—Hello.
—Cousin, Poison just took out some cops.

20
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:20,391
—Yes, go on. How many?
—Two.

21
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:22,977
Yeah, but two what?
Sergeants or officers?

22
00:02:23,061 --> 00:02:25,021
Officers. You know Poison.

23
00:02:25,104 --> 00:02:28,900
—Officers are a million each.
—OK, so two million?

24
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:32,070
—Yes, I’m writing it down here.
—OK, talk to you later.

25
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,529
All right.

26
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,281
What were you talking about?

27
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:38,283
Just business.

28
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:40,995
I want to be a businessman like you.

29
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:37,035
Good morning, ladies.
Where are you headed?

30
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:44,084
You speak Spanish?

31
00:09:44,168 --> 00:09:45,377
Yes.

32
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:48,964
I asked where you are headed.

33
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:51,342
—Popayán.
—Popayán?

34
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:53,010
Your papers, please.

35
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,308
Ms. Connie Murphy.

36
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:44,102
Alba Borraga.

37
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:46,855
Have a nice trip.

38
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:49,483
—Thank you.
—Be well.

39
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:16,314
WITH GAVIRIA
THERE WILL BE A FUTURE

40
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:38,378
Have you heard of this thing
called a computer?

41
00:14:39,254 --> 00:14:42,841
Some guy was trying to sell me one.
I don’t know what it is.

42
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:48,305
It’s a new kind of technology
that’s coming out.

43
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:51,558
—It’s coming out now?
—Yeah, Dad.

44
00:14:53,811 --> 00:14:55,895
Hey, honey.

45
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:01,067
You look very beautiful today.

46
00:15:03,487 --> 00:15:07,157
Relax, baby. Relax.
We don’t bite.

47
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:12,788
—Do you need anything else?
—I want you.

48
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:16,500
—Nothing more, thank you.
—Yes, sir.

49
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:21,338
I want to fuck her.

50
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:25,467
We have more important things
to worry about right now, my son.

51
00:15:25,676 --> 00:15:27,218
Understood?

52
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:30,930
Talk to me. What do you know?

53
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:33,809
Mr Gonzalo,
we have people all over the property.

54
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:35,226
It’s secure.

55
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,646
We’ve got a few men in town as well.

56
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:43,276
Now, what can you tell me about Medellín?

57
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:46,613
The same, boss.

58
00:15:46,697 --> 00:15:50,784
Carrillo’s entire Search Bloc
is out looking for Pablo.

59
00:15:50,868 --> 00:15:52,243
Thank you, Navegante.

60
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:55,372
—Here to serve, boss.
—Keep us safe.

61
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,167
Don Freddy.

62
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:05,173
Son … a question.

63
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:09,511
Are we sheep or are we wolves?

64
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,973
—We’re wolves.
—We’re wolves! Right.

65
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:15,559
I like it.

66
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:21,940
They’re in a house outside of Cartagena.
Right here.

67
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:25,819
Just know there are a lot of people
guarding him.

68
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:31,032
Navegante, you’ve been
working for Gacha for many years.

69
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:35,036
I’m sure in that time you’ve
earned way more than we are giving you.

70
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:38,498
So tell me,
why do you want to betray him?

71
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:44,128
That fucker’s crazy.

72
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:47,758
He’s gonna get us all killed.

73
00:16:57,976 --> 00:17:00,311
I don’t believe him one bit.

74
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:03,106
What do you care why he’s doing it?

75
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:08,319
Because we have 23 agents with
outdated weapons waiting in Barranquilla.

76
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:12,574
And he has twice as many men
with brand new weapons.

77
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:14,367
And frankly …

78
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:18,872
I’m tired of sending young men
to face certain death.

79
00:17:18,956 --> 00:17:21,082
So then we have to be smart.

80
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:25,253
We have to create a trap.

81
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:27,923
If we catch him alive,
he’ll give us Escobar.

82
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:29,507
And the Ochoas.

83
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:33,344
—The entire cartel.
—I don’t give a fuck, Javier.

84
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:34,763
I want him dead.

85
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:36,974
He doesn’t care about death.

86
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:40,143
He only fears rotting in jail.

87
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:45,440
—That’s the real victory.
—Right, I forgot you’re a gringo.

88
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:50,361
—What’s that supposed to mean?
—What are you risking?

89
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:52,238
These aren’t your men.

90
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:54,658
You have no family here to lose.

91
00:17:54,783 --> 00:17:57,285
If this goes badly, there will be
more widows and orphans,

92
00:17:57,452 --> 00:18:00,497
and I will have to carry that
on my shoulders.

93
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,585
Well …

94
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:08,254
I trust his information.

95
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:13,301
And I trust you.

96
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:19,098
But if this turns out bad …
it’ll be on your conscience.

97
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:53,758
Here’s your payment, sir.

98
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:59,764
It’ll be taken to the coast of Spain
on a cargo ship.

99
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:03,184
From there, our trucks
will take it to the Basque country.

100
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:06,312
It’s all set up.

101
00:19:09,066 --> 00:19:12,402
5,000 kilos or I go back to Spain
on the first flight.

102
00:19:16,865 --> 00:19:18,324
What’s that?

103
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:22,579
As far as I know, you and my cousin
have an agreement.

104
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:24,998
The agreement is for this amount.

105
00:19:25,082 --> 00:19:26,958
What kind of bullshit is this?

106
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:30,336
5,000 kilos or no deal.

107
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,339
Then there is no deal.

108
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:35,717
Who the fuck
do you think you’re talking to?

109
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:42,849
Forgive my cousin, sir.

110
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:50,857
5,000 it is, then.

111
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:00,784
We shouldn’t go.

112
00:20:02,077 --> 00:20:04,287
I want you in the US.

113
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:07,290
You’ll be safe there,
far from all of this.

114
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:10,293
—What if something happens--
—Nothing is going to happen to me.

115
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:12,921
Let’s go.

116
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:27,518
Please, protect him.

117
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:31,564
Don’t worry. Everything will be fine.
Come on, I’ll walk you.

118
00:20:37,112 --> 00:20:39,197
Bye, Daddy, I love you!

119
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:41,676
—Hello, Suárez.
—Look who’s here.

120
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:43,553
The Golden Gringo.

121
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:48,183
I called your office.

122
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:50,852
I only speak to Peña.

123
00:21:56,066 --> 00:21:57,358
I need …

124
00:21:57,567 --> 00:21:58,860
I need …

125
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:03,781
I need to know who he is.

126
00:22:05,575 --> 00:22:09,079
“I need to know who he is.”

127
00:22:09,287 --> 00:22:11,330
Don’t make me laugh, faggot.

128
00:22:12,249 --> 00:22:14,584
“I need to know who he is.”

129
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:25,929
You work for me, asshole!
Right? Is that clear?

130
00:22:26,137 --> 00:22:27,597
Is that clear‽

131
00:24:32,055 --> 00:24:36,142
—I feel like he’s still too soft.
—He’ll be fine.

132
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:39,979
I don’t know, Pablo.

133
00:24:40,063 --> 00:24:42,732
I feel like we need
to suspend the operation.

134
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:46,361
—It’s too delicate.
—You worry too much, Gustavo.

135
00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:50,698
That’s the reason
your hair is falling out.

136
00:24:52,033 --> 00:24:54,035
Very funny, motherfucker.

137
00:24:56,704 --> 00:24:58,456
Keep laughing.

138
00:25:01,209 --> 00:25:03,086
How’s our boy doing, Mom?

139
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:06,381
He’s learning,
with a little tough love.

140
00:25:06,464 --> 00:25:08,425
—What’s up, Aunt?
—What’s new?

141
00:25:09,426 --> 00:25:13,804
That’s so he can mix
with the sons of the oligarchs, right?

142
00:25:13,888 --> 00:25:16,474
—Yes, sir.
—So he can get us some information.

143
00:25:17,767 --> 00:25:19,394
What about these clowns?

144
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:22,439
Are they treating you right?

145
00:25:23,398 --> 00:25:25,191
More or less.

146
00:25:26,234 --> 00:25:29,612
What do you mean “more or less”?
We treat you good.

147
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:32,615
Are we going to eat, Gustavo?

148
00:25:35,326 --> 00:25:36,744
—Some rice?
—Yes.

149
00:25:43,418 --> 00:25:44,794
Thank you.

150
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:47,297
Jaime.

151
00:25:49,424 --> 00:25:51,592
Welcome to the family.

152
00:25:53,303 --> 00:25:55,263
Thank you, boss.

153
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:00,893
Can’t you do anything?

154
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:03,187
No.

155
00:26:05,189 --> 00:26:07,400
While we’re at war,
we can’t do anything.

156
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:10,861
This is bullshit.
People are turning up dead every day

157
00:26:10,945 --> 00:26:14,157
and my friends
think my brothers are responsible.

158
00:26:16,284 --> 00:26:18,702
Let’s talk about something else, baby.

159
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:20,830
Yeah.

160
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:24,875
All right,
let’s talk about running away together.

161
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:27,003
Let’s get away while we can.

162
00:26:29,464 --> 00:26:32,758
“Let’s get away.”
Listen to this.

163
00:26:38,848 --> 00:26:41,600
Why would you run away
with a criminal like me?

164
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:44,812
And why not?

165
00:26:47,565 --> 00:26:49,567
I wish it was that easy.

166
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:52,278
I can’t just leave like that.

167
00:26:52,362 --> 00:26:54,280
I know.

168
00:26:54,364 --> 00:26:56,824
You say that because of your wife.

169
00:26:56,907 --> 00:26:59,369
I don’t give a shit about my wife.

170
00:27:00,328 --> 00:27:04,457
I’m talking about your other wife, Pablo.

171
00:27:04,541 --> 00:27:06,792
Who is the woman in that relationship?

172
00:27:06,876 --> 00:27:08,294
You?

173
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,657
Hey, doll.

174
00:27:38,741 --> 00:27:40,243
What are you doing?

175
00:27:42,036 --> 00:27:43,329
I’m married, sir.

176
00:27:43,413 --> 00:27:45,456
That’s no problem.
I can make you a widow pretty quick.

177
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,958
Don’t touch me! Don’t touch me.

178
00:27:48,042 --> 00:27:50,545
Freddy, leave her alone.
Come here.

179
00:27:50,628 --> 00:27:51,670
What’s up?

180
00:27:51,879 --> 00:27:55,299
The Search Bloc is here,
not in Medellín.

181
00:27:55,383 --> 00:27:57,134
But Navegante said they were over there.

182
00:27:57,218 --> 00:28:01,013
Navegante … Navegante is a liar.

183
00:28:01,222 --> 00:28:02,640
He wouldn’t betray you.

184
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:07,228
Freddy … think, think.

185
00:28:07,311 --> 00:28:10,273
Everyone in the world has a price.

186
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:14,110
All right, let’s go!

187
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:17,238
They want war, we’ll give them war!

188
00:30:55,646 --> 00:30:59,400
His name is Steve Murphy.
He’s DEA.

189
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:01,819
I hope you’ll pay for this information.

190
00:31:12,455 --> 00:31:15,625
Suárez is talking to the DEA.

191
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:20,337
You know what you have to do.

192
00:31:53,704 --> 00:31:55,122
He got away.

193
00:31:56,707 --> 00:31:58,793
They killed the goddamn maid.

194
00:32:02,171 --> 00:32:03,339
Colonel!

195
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:07,926
Colonel …

196
00:32:10,137 --> 00:32:11,806
They called from the road block.

197
00:32:11,889 --> 00:32:15,518
They have a car stopped
and they’re saying the driver’s a senator.

198
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:18,103
—Does he have his identification?
—Everything checks out.

199
00:32:18,187 --> 00:32:19,689
So what’s the problem?

200
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:23,233
They found a machine gun in the trunk.

201
00:32:24,026 --> 00:32:25,402
Let’s go.

202
00:32:36,372 --> 00:32:38,207
Look at my credentials.

203
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:41,210
No, I don’t know this Gacha person
you’re referring to.

204
00:32:42,503 --> 00:32:45,005
Why do you have a gun in the trunk?

205
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:52,930
Gentlemen, are you asking why a politician
in this country carries a weapon?

206
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:54,724
Please.

207
00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:57,727
—It’s my bodyguard’s.
—Where’s your bodyguard?

208
00:32:58,769 --> 00:33:00,938
You’re alone in the car, right?

209
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:04,608
Listen to me, officers …

210
00:33:04,692 --> 00:33:09,321
if you don’t let me go immediately,
you’re going to regret it.

211
00:33:13,784 --> 00:33:15,077
Thank you.

212
00:33:15,786 --> 00:33:18,414
—Give us a moment.
—Go on.

213
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:23,293
I don’t believe him.

214
00:33:23,377 --> 00:33:24,962
I don’t either.

215
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:29,508
He could have bought his credentials.

216
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:33,095
What if it turns out he is a senator?

217
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:34,931
We’ll pay for that.

218
00:33:36,891 --> 00:33:39,476
I can’t run that risk.

219
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,395
It’s true.

220
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:43,188
You can’t.

221
00:33:46,901 --> 00:33:50,654
The next one …
goes in your head!

222
00:33:50,738 --> 00:33:52,489
—All right, all right!
—Talk, bitch!

223
00:33:52,573 --> 00:33:54,658
I’ll talk, I’ll talk!

224
00:33:56,410 --> 00:34:00,163
I love you, my sweetheart.
I love you.

225
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:03,250
You have a guest.
It’s Don Pablo.

226
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:06,796
Hey, Jaime.

227
00:34:06,879 --> 00:34:08,464
—Don Pablo.
—This is your house?

228
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:11,550
—Your family?
—Yes, sir. Welcome.

229
00:34:11,634 --> 00:34:12,927
Tell me about them.

230
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:15,638
This is my daughter Marcela.

231
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:18,015
Look at what a cute baby.

232
00:34:18,098 --> 00:34:20,810
—How proud you must be.
—Of course I am.

233
00:34:20,893 --> 00:34:22,812
Of course.

234
00:34:22,895 --> 00:34:27,274
Very soon, they will have the money
to buy everything they want, Jaime.

235
00:34:27,357 --> 00:34:28,901
Thanks a lot, boss.

236
00:34:28,985 --> 00:34:30,903
—May I please have a glass of water?
—Of course.

237
00:34:30,987 --> 00:34:32,488
Thank you.

238
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:33,739
—What about you?
—Good, sir.

239
00:34:33,823 --> 00:34:36,826
—How have you been?
—Good, thank you.

240
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:38,828
Guys.

241
00:34:39,662 --> 00:34:42,164
All right, Jaime.

242
00:34:43,499 --> 00:34:46,585
This is for you to wear
during your mission.

243
00:34:46,669 --> 00:34:48,253
Thank you, Ma’am. Very kind.

244
00:34:48,337 --> 00:34:50,297
Seriously, Pablo?

245
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,090
Thank you very much.

246
00:34:52,174 --> 00:34:54,259
Everything is so beautiful.

247
00:34:54,343 --> 00:34:59,056
You have to be very careful,
and get by unnoticed.

248
00:34:59,139 --> 00:35:02,351
For sure, sir.
I’m ready to do what you’re asking.

249
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:04,561
All right, then, son.

250
00:35:04,645 --> 00:35:06,104
Sit down.

251
00:35:08,148 --> 00:35:12,402
These guys are going to give you
very specific instructions.

252
00:35:12,486 --> 00:35:15,531
Tomorrow morning, you’re boarding
the plane that is leaving for Cali.

253
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:18,742
We want you to record a conversation.

254
00:35:18,826 --> 00:35:21,578
It’s very simple. Nothing to worry about.

255
00:35:22,705 --> 00:35:24,540
All right.

256
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:31,839
—How are you feeling?
—I’m … I’m very happy.

257
00:35:31,922 --> 00:35:35,759
Thank you very much for the opportunity,
Don Pablo. Seriously. And for the clothes.

258
00:35:35,843 --> 00:35:38,595
Really, for me,
it’s an honour to work for you.

259
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:40,347
Thank you very much.

260
00:35:41,557 --> 00:35:43,225
Don’t mention it.

261
00:35:44,894 --> 00:35:46,353
OK.

262
00:35:46,436 --> 00:35:48,772
Come here, give me a hug.

263
00:35:50,566 --> 00:35:52,442
Thank you, Don Pablo.

264
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:55,362
Thank you.

265
00:35:56,363 --> 00:35:58,532
—Ma’am, have a good night.
—Take care.

266
00:35:58,615 --> 00:36:00,242
Thank you very much.

267
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:01,994
See you later, boys.

268
00:36:02,078 --> 00:36:04,287
—Take care.
—Yes, sir.

269
00:36:04,371 --> 00:36:06,832
My love, look!

270
00:36:06,916 --> 00:36:11,294
—Look at this jacket. Beautiful, right?
—It’s beautiful. What did Pablo say?

271
00:36:11,378 --> 00:36:14,882
You know what?
We’re going to get ahead.

272
00:36:16,258 --> 00:36:19,970
You, me and the baby
are going to get ahead.

273
00:36:20,054 --> 00:36:21,388
Thank you, my love.

274
00:36:21,471 --> 00:36:24,141
—Look at this.
—Let’s go try it on.

275
00:36:27,603 --> 00:36:30,230
I have some news about Gaviria.

276
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:33,067
They’re going to kill him
on the way to Cali.

277
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:45,245
Wait a moment.
Someone is at the door.

278
00:37:01,095 --> 00:37:03,097
Pablo doesn’t like you talking to the DEA.

279
00:37:48,184 --> 00:37:49,893
It was her fault, Dad.

280
00:37:49,977 --> 00:37:53,396
Are you still thinking about that?
Let it go, son.

281
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:57,442
All she had to do was say yes
and I wouldn’t have had to shoot her!

282
00:37:57,526 --> 00:37:58,819
Be a man!

283
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:29,892
Son of a bitch! They found us!

284
00:38:52,206 --> 00:38:53,790
Come on, son!

285
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:39,044
—Sir, are you OK?
—I’m fine. I’m fine.

286
00:39:39,128 --> 00:39:41,379
—He’s trying to get away!
—He won’t get away.

287
00:39:41,463 --> 00:39:43,215
Get me a radio, quick!

288
00:39:43,299 --> 00:39:45,425
Correal, bring a radio!
Correal! A radio!

289
00:39:46,593 --> 00:39:49,972
Dad, let’s go! Hurry, Dad, hurry!

290
00:39:52,308 --> 00:39:54,017
Hurry!

291
00:40:03,235 --> 00:40:04,236
Stop!

292
00:40:19,668 --> 00:40:22,921
Peña! Gacha is in a red Chevy pick-up!

293
00:40:28,844 --> 00:40:31,596
What did I tell you?
We got out OK.

294
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,308
—I’m scared.
—Scared of what?

295
00:40:34,391 --> 00:40:36,226
You’re a wolf, right?

296
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:38,395
Yes, I am a wolf.

297
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:50,032
It’s a helicopter! It’s a helicopter!
They’re going to kill us!

298
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,492
Nobody is going to kill us!
Don’t talk like that!

299
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:54,494
Take this. Take it!

300
00:40:58,748 --> 00:41:01,418
—I have a Chevy in sight.
—Stop him!

301
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:04,796
Don’t let him get away!
Try and disable the vehicle!

302
00:41:23,899 --> 00:41:26,609
No good. We’re going in again.

303
00:41:26,693 --> 00:41:29,529
Stop him!
Do whatever you have to do!

304
00:41:32,949 --> 00:41:37,120
—Don’t leave me alone, Dad.
—No, no. Never, son, never!

305
00:41:37,204 --> 00:41:39,998
Breathe! Breathe!

306
00:41:40,082 --> 00:41:43,752
Do you want this, asshole?
Do you want this?

307
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:47,714
We’re taking fire. We’ll circle around
and approach from another direction.

308
00:41:47,923 --> 00:41:52,052
You don’t need to worry about anything,
my son. Nothing.

309
00:41:52,261 --> 00:41:55,722
Don’t take any chances!
We can’t afford to lose him!

310
00:41:55,805 --> 00:41:56,973
Copy.

311
00:41:59,101 --> 00:42:02,020
Look. Look outside. Look outside!

312
00:42:06,483 --> 00:42:09,278
What’s happening?
Peña, what’s happening?

313
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:19,246
We stopped him.
He’s not moving.

314
00:42:22,499 --> 00:42:24,251
Freddy. Freddy?

315
00:42:24,334 --> 00:42:26,169
Let’s go, Freddy.

316
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:28,088
Freddy?

317
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,299
Freddy?

318
00:42:30,382 --> 00:42:32,175
Son!

319
00:42:37,931 --> 00:42:40,683
You’re a wolf. You’re a wolf.

320
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,481
Asshole!

321
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:48,525
Asshole! Hey, asshole!

322
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:50,486
Freddy! Wake up, Freddy!

323
00:42:52,488 --> 00:42:54,281
Hey, asshole!
What are you going to do?

324
00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:57,284
What are you going to do?
Asshole!

325
00:42:57,493 --> 00:43:00,245
What are you going to do‽

326
00:43:03,165 --> 00:43:06,168
He’s out of bullets.
We can take him alive.

327
00:43:08,837 --> 00:43:10,755
It’s your call.

328
00:43:19,556 --> 00:43:21,016
Give him lead.

329
00:43:41,286 --> 00:43:45,915
Affirmative. Maintain positions
and patrol the area again. Very good.

330
00:43:59,262 --> 00:44:00,638
Are you OK?

331
00:44:20,367 --> 00:44:23,412
According to recent polls,
we’re doing well.

332
00:44:23,495 --> 00:44:26,289
We’re gaining more points
in six districts within Cali.

333
00:44:27,082 --> 00:44:30,544
They’re important
because we could gain the lead.

334
00:44:30,627 --> 00:44:33,630
—Don’t put too much faith in the polls.
—I know.

335
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:36,633
The last time,
we fell five points in one day.

336
00:44:36,716 --> 00:44:37,551
Yes.

337
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,262
Stop him!
Sir, we can’t let you through!

338
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:42,347
Relax. Let him through.

339
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:28,851
You nervous?

340
00:45:28,935 --> 00:45:31,313
A little bit, but I’m fine.

341
00:45:31,396 --> 00:45:33,273
Wait here.

342
00:45:33,356 --> 00:45:35,484
You know what you have to do?

343
00:45:35,567 --> 00:45:37,360
Yes, sir.

344
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:44,660
Remember, you have to record
the entire conversation. Don’t forget.

345
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:48,330
—No, sir.
—Have a nice flight.

346
00:45:48,413 --> 00:45:50,332
Aren’t you coming with me?

347
00:45:50,415 --> 00:45:55,712
No, the boss just told me
to bring you here.

348
00:45:55,795 --> 00:45:57,755
But don’t worry.

349
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:00,467
Tomorrow, I’ll come and meet you there.

350
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:04,680
—All right, then.
—All right. Don’t be nervous.

351
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:06,598
You’ll see how fun it is to fly.

352
00:46:07,683 --> 00:46:09,142
All right?

353
00:46:09,976 --> 00:46:12,688
Go on. The line is right there.

354
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,648
Good luck, then.

355
00:46:22,989 --> 00:46:25,116
It’s up to you, Eduardo.

356
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,869
Whatever you decide, I’ll do.

357
00:46:28,953 --> 00:46:32,957
Avianca announces the departure
of Flight 203 to Cali,

358
00:46:33,041 --> 00:46:35,502
now boarding at Gate 6.

359
00:46:45,345 --> 00:46:48,306
I’ll organize the exit.
You guys stay with him.

360
00:47:05,615 --> 00:47:07,825
Put on your seatbelt, please.
