1
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,713
How's it coming?

2
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,091
Very, very well.

3
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:53,261
It's a flurry of deliveries.

4
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:56,306
Feels like Christmas morning.

5
00:00:57,349 --> 00:00:59,184
It's exciting.

6
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:02,979
It's really coming together.
And I'd like to point out

7
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:05,941
that if you have
any understandable questions

8
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:08,151
about the price tag...

9
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:12,781
That sound? Quality.

10
00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:17,536
At Pfizer, at Merck,
that unit would be right at home.

11
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:19,246
That goes for all of it.

12
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:23,834
Good. I want you
to have what you need.

13
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:28,713
Well, I doff my proverbial cap
to you, sir.

14
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,132
When do you think
we'll be up and running?

15
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:32,634
Within a month, I'd say.

16
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:35,512
Two weeks.

17
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:40,725
Or, yeah, two weeks.

18
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:42,853
Good. Very good.

19
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:46,606
{\an8}By the way,
that sample you asked me to run?

20
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:52,654
- I ran it, and it is quite good.
- Thank you very much, Gale.

21
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:55,782
- You can give that to Victor to discard.
- Sure.

22
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,493
Is that our competition?

23
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,371
- I'm sorry?
- The...

24
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,623
It really is quite good.

25
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:08,086
The purity, of course, I'm speaking of,
speaking strictly in chemical terms.

26
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:12,549
And I can't, as of yet,
account for the blue color,

27
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:16,136
but if that is our competition

28
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:19,639
we have our work cut out for us,
so to speak.

29
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:23,768
You don't have any competition, Gale,
not as far as I'm concerned.

30
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:27,522
After all, how pure can pure be?

31
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:32,027
Well, it can be pretty darn pure.

32
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:38,366
Mr. Fring, I can guarantee you
a purity of 96 percent.

33
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:42,495
I'm proud of that figure.
It's a hard-earned figure, 96.

34
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:46,082
However, this other product is 99.

35
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:49,544
Maybe even a touch beyond that.

36
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:53,006
I'd need an instrument
called a gas chromatograph

37
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,549
to say for sure,

38
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:57,928
but that last 3 percent

39
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:02,307
it may not sound like a lot, but it is.

40
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:04,476
It's tremendous.

41
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:08,480
It's a tremendous gulf.

42
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:14,319
Gale, for our purposes,
96 percent will do just fine.

43
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:17,572
Please, don't let this trouble you.

44
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:21,201
Yeah. It's just...

45
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:26,039
I'd love to know
who synthesized it, is all.

46
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,835
A man who wants to work with me.

47
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:33,046
A trained chemist, like yourself.

48
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:35,632
But it won't happen.

49
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,134
I don't consider him a professional.

50
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:44,182
If he's not,
I don't know what that makes me.

51
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:47,352
I'm not trying
to talk myself out of a job...

52
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,939
With this person,
there are other considerations.

53
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:55,777
His is the best I've ever seen,
hands down.

54
00:03:57,862 --> 00:04:00,949
And I look at this place
that you've built

55
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:03,410
the money you're investing

56
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,996
sparing no expense.

57
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,456
And I know...

58
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:14,796
I know that you want the best.

59
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:15,941
6353 Juan Tabo. Apartment 6.

60
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:18,652
No, no. Eubank's west.

61
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:22,697
It's between Eubank and Spain,
but Mazatlan's closest.

62
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:26,118
I don't know. I just heard the one

63
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:29,037
like, you know, a backfire,
a truck backfiring.

64
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:31,790
{\an8}I came out of my apartment.
A couple came out.

65
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:33,750
{\an8}No. No, nobody saw.

66
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,419
{\an8}Did you guys see anybody?

67
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:39,923
{\an8}Guys, did you...? I don't know
if they speak English too good.

68
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,259
{\an8}I don't think they saw anybody.

69
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:46,096
{\an8}It was just this one loud...
This very loud pop and that was all.

70
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:48,849
{\an8}No arguing or like that.

71
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:53,478
{\an8}So you guys good in directions there?
You want me to...?

72
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:57,023
{\an8}They coming east or west?

73
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:01,778
{\an8}If heading east, tell them there's
an Exxon on their left-hand side.

74
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:05,574
{\an8}Then it's straight residential.
You want me to what? Yeah.

75
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,993
{\an8}No. I'll stay on the line.

76
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:13,915
{\an8}You know him?

77
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:17,669
We all heard this shot.
I don't think you ought to go in there.

78
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:21,339
Mister, this is a crime scene.
You don't wanna touch anything.

79
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,175
Mister?

80
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,679
Mister, are you listening to me?

81
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:47,282
Little bastard.

82
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,244
Drive.

83
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,246
Drive.

84
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,218
{\an8}What the hell happened?

85
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:32,596
He's gone?

86
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,932
Look at me.

87
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,809
Gone?

88
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:39,603
You sure?

89
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:44,065
- Gone. Splattered all over.
- Oh, Jesus.

90
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,152
Jesus. Oh, shit.

91
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,573
{\an8}All right.

92
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,908
{\an8}So...

93
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:55,493
{\an8}Shit.

94
00:08:56,745 --> 00:09:00,040
- All right, you do a sweep?
- Couldn't. People there.

95
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:05,211
{\an8}People? He get himself seen
by these people?

96
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,671
What about you?

97
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:11,092
What about you?

98
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,553
Yeah. So what?

99
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,474
Just another looky-loo.

100
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,696
I guess I'd better get this over with.

101
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,810
Hey.

102
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,938
Oh, jeez, I woke you up.
I woke you up.

103
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:08,066
No, no, no, it's okay.
I needed to get up anyway.

104
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:09,776
Are you coming in?

105
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:12,404
No. It's kind of my only time
to run errands.

106
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,030
I just needed to...

107
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,535
I...

108
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,496
Sorry.

109
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:22,914
It's okay.

110
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:28,002
And thank you, big time, as always.

111
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:32,382
They seem to be getting bigger
instead of smaller.

112
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:35,760
Not really sure what that's all about.

113
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,388
Please, for God's sake

114
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:41,433
tell me if this is getting
to be too much for you.

115
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,185
Absolutely not, okay?
It's absolutely fine.

116
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,146
Okay.

117
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,944
Does this mean what I think it means?

118
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:57,115
- What?
- You and Walt?

119
00:10:58,241 --> 00:10:59,451
What?

120
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:02,579
His car is in the driveway.
It's not a state secret.

121
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:07,000
I... All right. Okay. I'm not pressing.
I just...

122
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,335
I think that it's great.

123
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,421
That's all, all right?

124
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:13,089
- I'm out of here.
- Okay.

125
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:18,511
Oh, hey. A big howdy-do
to Mr. I'm-Not-Here.

126
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,208
<i>...in Albuquerque today.</i>

127
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:34,462
<i>But you know what? It always is when
you have 330 days of sunshine a year.</i>

128
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,267
<i>...the morning commute, northbound 25...</i>

129
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,353
<i>...we've got a two-car accident
on the right shoulder.</i>

130
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,398
<i>You gotta be careful.
Also, from the west side</i>

131
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:57,360
<i>we've got another accident,
Paseo del Norte and Second Street.</i>

132
00:12:57,527 --> 00:13:00,613
<i>That one's on the left shoulder,
so be on the lookout.</i>

133
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,950
<i>That's a look at your morning commute
on Coyote 102.5.</i>

134
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:48,870
Oh, hey.

135
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:51,331
- Breakfast?
- Yeah.

136
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,416
Yeah? Okay.

137
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,341
All right. What you want?

138
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:27,200
All right, look.

139
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:30,662
So I make it 10 to 9, which means...

140
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:33,915
Shut up.

141
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:40,129
Which means we need to start a cook
in the next 10 minutes

142
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,839
to keep to our schedule.

143
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:44,676
Gus' schedule.

144
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:49,597
And as angry as he may be,
I don't believe he's willing

145
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:51,432
to forfeit an entire batch.

146
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:54,394
That just might make him angrier.

147
00:14:57,355 --> 00:15:00,108
Come on, Mike. Let us cook.

148
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:03,111
Isn't that
what this whole thing is about?

149
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:16,976
That's right, genius. Watch me.

150
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,896
We ain't missing no cook.

151
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,839
We're closed.

152
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,258
Closed.

153
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,925
Saul Goodman and Associates.

154
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:33,928
I'll see if he's in. Please hold.

155
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,974
Saul, Skyler White calling.

156
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:43,354
Saul.

157
00:17:57,535 --> 00:17:59,995
Saul, Skyler White on the line.

158
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:03,165
- Saul.
- Hey.

159
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:05,459
Skyler White.

160
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,421
What the hell does she want?

161
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,138
He's nowhere to be found.

162
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:19,515
I called his condo, every number I have.

163
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:21,183
<i>Yeah, I'm sure he's fine.</i>

164
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,185
You're sure?

165
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,729
As in, you know where he is?

166
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:30,484
I'm not the man's keeper,
but Walt's a big boy. He'll turn up.

167
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,528
<i>Mr. Goodman,
something is going on.</i>

168
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:35,364
Why would he leave his car
in my driveway?

169
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:38,868
People carpool to work, right?
It's good for the environment.

170
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:42,580
He carpools?
He carpools to his job at a meth lab?

171
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:45,416
Hey, you're breaking up there.

172
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:48,294
I didn't quite catch that last...

173
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:51,797
- <i>You're a Chatty Cathy today.</i>
- Okay, do you know anything?

174
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:55,426
Anything at all?
Please, I'm looking for some help here.

175
00:18:55,593 --> 00:19:00,973
Look, Walter is fine, okay?
I guarantee that, hundred percent.

176
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:04,226
One hundred percent.

177
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:11,150
You got a passport, right?

178
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,361
Yeah. Albuquerque.

179
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:57,738
I'm in Nob Hill.

180
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:00,741
I need the number for a locksmith.

181
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:03,118
I don't know. Pick one.

182
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:07,665
- You sure there's nothing?
- No, it's not even me. It's state law.

183
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:10,751
Are you sure there isn't some sort of...?
I don't know.

184
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,670
No. Nothing.

185
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:16,173
Maybe a car registration.
That would have your address.

186
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:20,803
No, but I can't even get in my car.
My car keys were on the same ring.

187
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:24,056
My God, my credit cards, my...
It's all right, sweetheart.

188
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:28,143
My driver's license, my checkbook.
I have to start canceling all that.

189
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:32,565
My whole life was in that purse
and he just cut it right off my shoulder.

190
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,400
We could've been stabbed.

191
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:38,779
I'm sorry, really.
But without proof of residency...

192
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,698
I can take you down to my shop.

193
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:43,284
You're welcome to wait,
file a police report.

194
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:46,787
I can't believe this.
I cannot believe this day.

195
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:49,707
I know. It's just, it's the law.

196
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:54,503
Oh, my God. My medication.
I bet it's gone.

197
00:20:56,589 --> 00:21:00,342
Oh, God, not now, not this.
Gotta call the pharmacy.

198
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,177
Are you okay?

199
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:06,473
Please, just... Please, just take her.
Please. Just take her, please.

200
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:09,893
Oh, God.

201
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,729
Not now.

202
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:14,440
No. Not now.

203
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:24,116
Oh, you're a lifesaver. Truly.

204
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:27,411
Here you go, sweetheart.
Oh, there you go.

205
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:34,501
How do you...?
How do you wanna deal with the bill?

206
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:39,006
I... Unfortunately,
all my cash was taken so...

207
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:43,636
- That's fine. We'll mail it to you.
- Will you? You know where I live, right?

208
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:48,182
- Sir, again, thank you so much. Really.
- Yeah.

209
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,876
Hey there. I'm back.

210
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:46,550
How was PT?

211
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:52,764
I heard it was very good.

212
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:56,810
I'm really liking this new therapist.

213
00:23:56,977 --> 00:24:00,772
He keeps me in the loop,
always has time for a phone call. It's...

214
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,649
I like it.

215
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:05,068
So?

216
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,905
Tell me all about it.

217
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:11,116
I heard you broke new ground today.

218
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,161
I broke new ground?

219
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:17,372
That's what he said. Tell me.

220
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:24,505
I walked 16 feet in 20 minutes

221
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:28,217
which is up from
like 15 and a half yesterday.

222
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:30,385
And this much less shit in my pants.

223
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:35,057
So, yeah, Marie, if you and him and
everybody in America took a vote

224
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:37,893
changed the meaning
of the English language

225
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:41,271
yeah, I guess
I "broke new ground."

226
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:49,439
Well, call it a figure of speech,
but I am seeing progress.

227
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:54,618
Definite progress.

228
00:24:56,537 --> 00:24:58,497
You're ordering a new rock?

229
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:01,542
I'm bidding on a new mineral.

230
00:25:03,252 --> 00:25:05,087
It's a nice one.

231
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:11,468
What? It's pretty.

232
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:13,637
I need the thing.

233
00:25:13,804 --> 00:25:15,430
Okay.

234
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:30,028
Okay.

235
00:25:55,137 --> 00:25:59,933
It has all those pretty little crystals.
I like that.

236
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,978
Okay.

237
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:29,921
All right, I just wanna go on record,
we should all be wearing masks.

238
00:26:37,054 --> 00:26:39,139
We should be wearing masks.

239
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:57,407
Bet he forgets the aluminum.

240
00:27:01,078 --> 00:27:03,038
Guaranteed.

241
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,540
Guarantee he forgets.

242
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:14,216
Oh, you don't know
what the hell you're doing, do you?

243
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:16,426
You forgot the aluminum.

244
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:22,265
One of the first steps in the...

245
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:30,565
Son of a bitch.

246
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:21,843
All right,
let's talk about Gale Boetticher.

247
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:24,471
He was a good man and a good chemist,

248
00:29:24,638 --> 00:29:26,556
and I cared about him.

249
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:30,811
He didn't deserve what happened to him.

250
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,772
He didn't deserve it at all.

251
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:42,113
But I'd shoot him again tomorrow
and the next day and the day after that.

252
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:46,993
When you make it Gale versus me,
or Gale versus Jesse

253
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:50,539
Gale loses, simple as that.

254
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:58,296
This is on you, Gus.
Not me, not Jesse.

255
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:01,258
Gale's death is on you.

256
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,804
I mean, really,
what did you expect me to do

257
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:10,308
just simply roll over
and allow you to murder us?

258
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:14,980
That I wouldn't take measures,
extreme measures to defend myself?

259
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:16,273
Wrong.

260
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:19,109
Think again.

261
00:30:19,276 --> 00:30:22,737
And whatever it is you're planning there

262
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:26,449
whatever it is, the point
that you're trying to make here

263
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:30,078
let me suggest
that you keep one thing in mind.

264
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:34,624
Without us, without Jesse and myself

265
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:38,795
you have no one to make your product.

266
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,965
Certainly not him.

267
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:45,802
This person doesn't know
what the hell he's doing.

268
00:30:46,136 --> 00:30:49,848
Been watching him for weeks.
I know every step to his cook.

269
00:30:52,726 --> 00:30:55,145
Do you really? You?

270
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:03,862
Really? Oh, so please tell me.

271
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:09,034
Catalytic hydrogenation, is it protic
or aprotic? Because I forget.

272
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,494
If our reduction isn't stereospecific

273
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:14,331
how can our product
be enantiomerically pure?

274
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:18,960
I mean, is 1-phenyl-1-hydroxy-
2-methylamino-propane

275
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:21,463
containing, of course, chiral centers

276
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:24,549
at carbons number one and two
on the propane chain?

277
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,885
Then reduction to methamphetamine

278
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:30,555
eliminates which chiral center
is it again?

279
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,849
Because I forgot.

280
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:36,478
Come on, help me out, professor.

281
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:38,313
Gus.

282
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:42,484
We're here. Come on. Let us work.

283
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:46,321
All his bullshit aside,
it's called a cook.

284
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:48,949
Everything comes down
to following a recipe.

285
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:51,618
Simple, complicated, it doesn't matter.

286
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:54,245
The steps never change,

287
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:56,539
and I know every step.

288
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:59,417
Oh, is that what you want?

289
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:05,090
This short-order cook?
You're not flipping hamburgers.

290
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:07,968
What happens when you get
a bad barrel of precursor?

291
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:09,678
How would you even know it?

292
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:13,974
And what happens in the summer
when the humidity rises,

293
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,810
and your product goes cloudy?

294
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:20,605
How would you guard against that, huh?

295
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,190
Gus.

296
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:27,153
You do this, all you'll have left

297
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,615
is an $8 million hole in the ground.

298
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,617
This lab

299
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:35,286
this equipment is useless without us.

300
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:39,708
Without Jesse and myself,
you have no new product.

301
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:41,918
You have no income.

302
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:46,297
Your people out there will not be paid.
Your distribution chain collapses.

303
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:48,508
Without us

304
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,969
you have nothing.

305
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:55,640
You kill me, you have nothing.

306
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,977
You kill Jesse, you don't have me.

307
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:15,201
You won't do this.

308
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:18,496
You're too smart.

309
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:21,249
You can't afford to do this.

310
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:24,252
Please.

311
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:28,715
Let us just go back to work.

312
00:33:28,882 --> 00:33:30,592
We're here.

313
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:35,013
Let us work.
We're ready to go to work.

314
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:38,099
We'll just pick up
right where we left off.

315
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,146
Well?

316
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,150
Get back to work.

317
00:38:13,584 --> 00:38:17,087
Listen, we'll just lay this down.

318
00:38:17,254 --> 00:38:21,550
Put him in feet first. Grab his shoe.

319
00:38:22,092 --> 00:38:26,054
Here. Wait, wait, wait.
Just lift him up. There. All right.

320
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:31,977
Oh, God.

321
00:38:32,144 --> 00:38:34,605
You push that way, I'll hold him in.

322
00:38:36,315 --> 00:38:39,359
Okay, ready? Go ahead.

323
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:41,862
Oh, shit.

324
00:38:43,113 --> 00:38:45,324
Wait, wait. Wait.

325
00:38:46,867 --> 00:38:48,535
Forget that. Okay.

326
00:38:58,295 --> 00:39:00,672
Come on. Up.

327
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:07,346
Get down.

328
00:39:08,388 --> 00:39:10,515
Okay, okay.

329
00:39:24,738 --> 00:39:27,866
I never use this stuff.
Are you sure it'll do the job?

330
00:39:28,909 --> 00:39:30,285
Trust us.

331
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:02,044
Here you go, hon.
Get you anything else?

332
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:04,046
No, I'm good. Thanks.

333
00:41:32,741 --> 00:41:34,201
How you doing?

334
00:41:37,412 --> 00:41:38,997
No, I mean, you know...

335
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:43,460
how are you doing?

336
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:52,969
You did the only thing that you could.

337
00:41:53,136 --> 00:41:55,138
I hope you understand that.

338
00:41:58,308 --> 00:42:00,310
Thoughts?

339
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:07,943
Any thoughts
on what our next move might be?

340
00:42:08,402 --> 00:42:10,153
What next move?

341
00:42:10,654 --> 00:42:12,030
Our next move.

342
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:18,495
Our next move, given the fact that at
the first opportunity, Gus will kill us.

343
00:42:18,662 --> 00:42:21,748
What, that wasn't an opportunity
just now?

344
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,292
Seemed like a damn good opportunity
to me.

345
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:26,753
- No, no.
- Golden, I would say.

346
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:30,549
We bought ourselves some time,
yes, but...

347
00:42:31,258 --> 00:42:35,512
The question is how much.
He'll be looking for another chemist.

348
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:38,515
He's not gonna find another chemist.

349
00:42:38,682 --> 00:42:41,226
Where is he gonna find another chemist?

350
00:42:41,476 --> 00:42:45,439
It's not just about somebody
being able to run a lab that big.

351
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:47,065
Someone he can trust

352
00:42:47,232 --> 00:42:51,111
someone he knows
will keep their mouths shut.

353
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,865
Yeah. Good luck with that.

354
00:42:56,408 --> 00:43:00,078
Bet it took him years to find Gale.

355
00:43:01,413 --> 00:43:02,831
Bet he's sorry now.

356
00:43:12,007 --> 00:43:15,427
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Now we all understand each other.

357
00:43:15,594 --> 00:43:17,220
Right?

358
00:43:18,013 --> 00:43:22,893
- What do you mean?
- I mean, him and us, we get it.

359
00:43:29,858 --> 00:43:32,611
We're all on the same page.

360
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:38,325
And what page is that?

361
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:40,785
The one that says:

362
00:43:40,952 --> 00:43:43,246
"If I can't kill you

363
00:43:43,455 --> 00:43:46,208
you'll sure as shit wish
you were dead."

364
00:43:57,511 --> 00:44:00,096
Yo, excuse me.

365
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:03,600
Thanks.

366
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,492
- Here.
- Thank you, sir. Have a good one.

367
00:44:20,659 --> 00:44:22,327
Thanks.

368
00:44:41,429 --> 00:44:43,139
Hi.

369
00:44:45,267 --> 00:44:47,310
Hi.

370
00:44:48,687 --> 00:44:51,022
It's parked over on Amsden.

371
00:44:51,314 --> 00:44:54,317
Junior was about to get up
and he would've seen it,

372
00:44:54,484 --> 00:44:57,529
so I wanted to avoid a lot of questions.

373
00:44:58,446 --> 00:45:00,156
Smart.

374
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:02,826
Well.

375
00:45:04,661 --> 00:45:05,704
Kenny Rogers.

376
00:45:07,998 --> 00:45:09,749
Yeah.

377
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,878
You okay?

378
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:16,673
Yeah.

379
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:19,509
Right as rain.

380
00:45:25,724 --> 00:45:28,226
Do you have your keys?

381
00:45:28,393 --> 00:45:29,811
Yeah.

382
00:45:31,146 --> 00:45:34,524
It's parked three blocks
down on the right.

383
00:45:36,943 --> 00:45:38,445
Yeah.
