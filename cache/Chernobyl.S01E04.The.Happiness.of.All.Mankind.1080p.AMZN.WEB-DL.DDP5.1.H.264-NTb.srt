1
00:00:05,625 --> 00:00:08,133
Why didn't you press the AZ-5 button?

2
00:00:08,887 --> 00:00:12,136
We did. And that's when it exploded.

3
00:00:13,774 --> 00:00:15,760
I don't want my men here one more second

4
00:00:15,762 --> 00:00:16,887
than they need to be.

5
00:00:18,845 --> 00:00:20,969
If these worked, you'd be wearing them.

6
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:24,426
Vasily...

7
00:00:24,428 --> 00:00:25,928
We're gonna have a baby.

8
00:00:27,345 --> 00:00:29,551
Do you have any idea
what you're dealing with?

9
00:00:29,553 --> 00:00:30,885
People are going to hear.

10
00:00:30,887 --> 00:00:32,470
What is everyone gonna hear?

11
00:00:33,637 --> 00:00:36,000
We have to pursue every possibility,

12
00:00:36,003 --> 00:00:37,635
no matter who is to blame.

13
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:42,175
This entire region must
be completely evacuated.

14
00:00:42,178 --> 00:00:43,762
How many men do you require?

15
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,928
Approximately 750,000 men.

16
00:01:30,276 --> 00:01:31,859
It's time to go.

17
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:36,009
Did you hear me?

18
00:01:36,011 --> 00:01:39,551
This is an evacuation. You understand?

19
00:01:39,553 --> 00:01:41,343
You have to come with me.

20
00:01:41,345 --> 00:01:43,176
Why?

21
00:01:43,178 --> 00:01:46,343
Because they told me,
so now I'm telling you.

22
00:01:46,345 --> 00:01:48,926
Everyone in this village, everyone.

23
00:01:48,928 --> 00:01:50,926
It's not safe here. There's
radiation in the air.

24
00:01:50,928 --> 00:01:52,967
What's wrong with you?

25
00:01:52,969 --> 00:01:54,635
Do you know how old I am?

26
00:01:56,261 --> 00:01:58,885
I don't know. Old.

27
00:01:58,887 --> 00:02:01,343
I'm 82.

28
00:02:01,345 --> 00:02:03,760
I've lived here my whole life.

29
00:02:03,762 --> 00:02:07,176
Right here, that house, this place.

30
00:02:07,178 --> 00:02:11,176
What do I care about safe?

31
00:02:11,178 --> 00:02:15,176
I have a job. Don't cause trouble.

32
00:02:15,178 --> 00:02:16,635
Trouble?

33
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:20,718
You're not the first soldier
to stand here with a gun.

34
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,843
When I was 12, the revolution came.

35
00:02:23,845 --> 00:02:27,821
Czar's men. Then Bolsheviks.

36
00:02:27,824 --> 00:02:30,966
Boys like you marching in lines.

37
00:02:30,969 --> 00:02:34,301
They told us to leave. No.

38
00:02:34,303 --> 00:02:36,885
Then there was Stalin and his famine,

39
00:02:36,887 --> 00:02:39,051
the Holodomor.

40
00:02:39,053 --> 00:02:43,176
My parents died. Two of my sisters died.

41
00:02:43,178 --> 00:02:45,885
They told the rest of us to leave.

42
00:02:45,887 --> 00:02:47,551
No.

43
00:02:47,553 --> 00:02:49,384
Then the Great War.

44
00:02:49,386 --> 00:02:52,676
German boys. Russian boys.

45
00:02:52,678 --> 00:02:56,219
More soldiers, more famine, more bodies.

46
00:02:57,219 --> 00:03:00,051
My brothers never came home.

47
00:03:00,053 --> 00:03:03,676
But I stayed, and I'm still here.

48
00:03:03,678 --> 00:03:06,926
After all that I have seen...

49
00:03:06,928 --> 00:03:09,092
so I should leave now,

50
00:03:09,094 --> 00:03:12,760
because of something
I cannot see at all?

51
00:03:12,762 --> 00:03:13,801
No.

52
00:03:27,261 --> 00:03:31,261
Just one moment!

53
00:03:38,762 --> 00:03:41,845
It's time to go.

54
00:03:48,553 --> 00:03:50,843
Please stand up now.

55
00:04:01,303 --> 00:04:03,094
This is your last warning.

56
00:04:19,802 --> 00:04:21,677
It's time to go.

57
00:05:34,845 --> 00:05:36,386
Come on.

58
00:06:40,428 --> 00:06:42,637
Point four.

59
00:06:53,303 --> 00:06:55,136
Point six.

60
00:06:59,511 --> 00:07:02,136
Fifteen.

61
00:07:59,386 --> 00:08:00,593
Legasov.

62
00:08:02,887 --> 00:08:04,553
I'll meet him there.

63
00:09:03,261 --> 00:09:05,470
The atom is a humbling thing.

64
00:09:06,928 --> 00:09:09,762
It's not humbling, it's humiliating.

65
00:09:11,678 --> 00:09:13,426
Why is the core still
exposed to the air?

66
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:15,468
Why have we not already covered it up?

67
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:19,426
We want to, but we
can't get close enough.

68
00:09:19,428 --> 00:09:23,343
The debris on the roof is
graphite from the core itself.

69
00:09:23,345 --> 00:09:27,509
Until we can push it off the
roof back into the reactor,

70
00:09:27,511 --> 00:09:29,801
it'll kill anyone who gets near it.

71
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:34,259
You can see the roof is in three levels.

72
00:09:34,261 --> 00:09:37,509
We've named them... the
small one here is Katya.

73
00:09:37,511 --> 00:09:39,718
One thousand roentgen per hour.

74
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,718
Presume two hours of exposure is fatal.

75
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,468
The one on the side... Nina.

76
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:46,676
Two thousand roentgen. One hour, fatal.

77
00:09:46,678 --> 00:09:49,926
We used remote-controlled
bulldozers in Afghanistan.

78
00:09:49,928 --> 00:09:53,092
Too heavy. They'd fall right through.

79
00:09:53,094 --> 00:09:56,843
- So then...?
- Moon rovers.

80
00:09:56,845 --> 00:09:58,878
Lunokhod STR-1's. They're light.

81
00:09:58,881 --> 00:10:01,676
And if we line them with lead,
they can withstand the radiation.

82
00:10:01,678 --> 00:10:03,901
We couldn't put a man on the moon.

83
00:10:03,904 --> 00:10:06,426
At least we can keep a man off a roof.

84
00:10:06,428 --> 00:10:08,676
That is the most
important thing, General.

85
00:10:08,678 --> 00:10:11,843
Under no circumstances
can men go up there.

86
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:14,343
Robots only.

87
00:10:14,345 --> 00:10:17,011
What about this large section here?

88
00:10:17,845 --> 00:10:19,470
Masha.

89
00:10:20,428 --> 00:10:22,345
Twelve thousand roentgen.

90
00:10:23,762 --> 00:10:25,404
If you were to stand there in full

91
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,843
protective gear
head-to-toe for two minutes,

92
00:10:27,845 --> 00:10:29,718
your life expectancy
would be cut in half.

93
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,176
By three minutes, you're
dead within months.

94
00:10:32,178 --> 00:10:35,343
Even our lunar rovers
won't work on Masha.

95
00:10:35,345 --> 00:10:38,513
That amount of gamma radiation
penetrates everything.

96
00:10:38,516 --> 00:10:40,258
The particles literally shred

97
00:10:40,261 --> 00:10:42,343
the circuits in microchips apart.

98
00:10:42,345 --> 00:10:45,176
If it's more complicated
than a light switch,

99
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:46,760
Masha will destroy it.

100
00:10:46,762 --> 00:10:48,259
It would be fair to say that

101
00:10:48,261 --> 00:10:51,386
that piece of roof is the
most dangerous place on Earth.

102
00:10:57,553 --> 00:11:01,219
So... what do we do?

103
00:11:03,219 --> 00:11:05,511
That's what we wanted to ask you.

104
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:24,720
Tent 181?

105
00:13:39,303 --> 00:13:40,762
It's all right. It's free.

106
00:13:42,053 --> 00:13:43,553
It's a little early.

107
00:13:56,887 --> 00:13:58,011
Bacho.

108
00:14:00,143 --> 00:14:01,268
Pavel.

109
00:14:02,637 --> 00:14:04,219
- Yeah?
- Mm.

110
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,676
What unit were you in?

111
00:14:10,678 --> 00:14:13,092
Uh, they had me in motor pool in Kiev,

112
00:14:13,094 --> 00:14:15,926
- but then they...
- Not this bullshit.

113
00:14:15,928 --> 00:14:17,343
In Afghanistan.

114
00:14:17,345 --> 00:14:20,553
Oh, um, I wasn't in Afghanistan.

115
00:14:23,178 --> 00:14:24,470
I'm not in the military.

116
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,470
They're running out of men.

117
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:43,259
Showers. Food.

118
00:14:43,261 --> 00:14:46,051
Those guys, they dig up the ground.

119
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:48,635
Those guys, they cut down trees.

120
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:52,176
Those guys, they
evacuate people, I think,

121
00:14:52,178 --> 00:14:53,637
like villagers.

122
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:56,178
What about them?

123
00:14:57,303 --> 00:14:59,178
I don't know them. Fuck them.

124
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:02,222
Janek!

125
00:15:04,011 --> 00:15:06,593
- What do you want?
- Give me an egg basket.

126
00:15:06,595 --> 00:15:09,845
- No, I've only got the one...
- Give me the fucking basket!

127
00:15:13,303 --> 00:15:15,801
He's with me, you understand?

128
00:15:15,803 --> 00:15:17,470
Nobody fucks with him.

129
00:15:19,928 --> 00:15:21,843
We make these from lead scrap.

130
00:15:21,845 --> 00:15:24,176
- Put it on under your balls.
- Now?

131
00:15:24,178 --> 00:15:27,092
No, no. You can wait until
the radiation gives you a cunt.

132
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:28,762
Yes, now.

133
00:15:30,887 --> 00:15:33,803
Over your clothes. Fucking shit.

134
00:15:42,045 --> 00:15:44,462
- You ever go hunting?
- No.

135
00:15:45,303 --> 00:15:48,635
Well... today's your lucky day.

136
00:15:48,637 --> 00:15:51,092
You, me,

137
00:15:51,095 --> 00:15:54,888
that ugly Armenian in the tent,
Garo, we do animal control.

138
00:15:56,261 --> 00:15:57,718
Animal control?

139
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,801
Yeah, they're radioactive,

140
00:15:59,803 --> 00:16:02,134
so they have to go.

141
00:16:02,136 --> 00:16:04,426
But it's not hard. They're mostly pets.

142
00:16:04,428 --> 00:16:07,787
They're happy to see you.
They run right up to you.

143
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:08,825
Bang!

144
00:16:08,828 --> 00:16:10,551
You load the bodies on the truck,

145
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:13,009
dump them in a pit,
bury them in concrete.

146
00:16:13,011 --> 00:16:14,801
And then we drink.

147
00:16:14,803 --> 00:16:19,053
As much vodka as you want,
plus a thousand rubles.

148
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:22,771
Let's go get you a gun.

149
00:17:32,053 --> 00:17:33,092
Yes?

150
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:35,259
I need to see the following documents.

151
00:17:35,261 --> 00:17:37,094
They're listed as permission only.

152
00:17:43,386 --> 00:17:45,595
I'm working for the Central Committee.

153
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:58,845
Comrade?

154
00:18:37,011 --> 00:18:38,678
She can have that one.

155
00:18:47,345 --> 00:18:49,178
Thank you, Comrade.

156
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,635
All clear.

157
00:20:28,637 --> 00:20:31,134
Bring up the cameras.

158
00:20:35,136 --> 00:20:37,301
- Signal?
- Acceptable.

159
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:39,301
Running onboard diagnostics.

160
00:20:39,303 --> 00:20:41,217
Tell me when we're ready to move it.

161
00:20:41,219 --> 00:20:44,470
To think that's what we put on the moon.

162
00:20:46,803 --> 00:20:48,511
Well, not that one.

163
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,967
I know not that one.

164
00:20:51,969 --> 00:20:55,551
This rover was in storage.
They can build two more.

165
00:20:55,553 --> 00:20:57,845
That should cover Nina and Katya.

166
00:20:58,803 --> 00:21:00,134
And Masha?

167
00:21:00,136 --> 00:21:02,301
The Central Committee have informed me

168
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:03,843
that they may have found something

169
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:06,509
that could work up
there. From the outside.

170
00:21:06,511 --> 00:21:08,301
American?

171
00:21:08,303 --> 00:21:10,301
Of course not.

172
00:21:10,303 --> 00:21:12,092
It's a German police robot.

173
00:21:12,094 --> 00:21:14,593
West German, so, as you can imagine,

174
00:21:14,595 --> 00:21:17,051
that wasn't an easy
conversation to have.

175
00:21:17,053 --> 00:21:18,343
Diagnostics complete.

176
00:21:18,345 --> 00:21:20,845
Ready to engage main power and motor.

177
00:21:21,511 --> 00:21:22,803
Begin.

178
00:21:28,665 --> 00:21:30,165
Can we move it?

179
00:21:43,178 --> 00:21:46,011
Valery, what's that? A smile?

180
00:22:05,136 --> 00:22:07,843
I see your condition has
improved, Comrade Dyatlov.

181
00:22:07,845 --> 00:22:09,386
No. Leave.

182
00:22:17,029 --> 00:22:19,237
I need your help.

183
00:22:26,969 --> 00:22:30,426
Akimov initiated AZ-5.

184
00:22:30,428 --> 00:22:33,136
- When you gave the order...
- Order? What order?

185
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,887
Toptunov called it
out, Akimov pressed it.

186
00:22:38,928 --> 00:22:40,635
It was the only good decision they made.

187
00:22:40,637 --> 00:22:42,219
Incompetent morons.

188
00:22:43,094 --> 00:22:46,217
Can you confirm that
the reactor exploded

189
00:22:46,219 --> 00:22:48,053
after they attempted to shut it down?

190
00:22:49,053 --> 00:22:51,428
How do I even know it exploded, huh?

191
00:23:12,386 --> 00:23:14,969
I found this in the state archive.

192
00:23:15,845 --> 00:23:17,967
Written in 1976.

193
00:23:17,969 --> 00:23:21,967
It's about the operation of RBMK
reactors under extreme conditions.

194
00:23:21,969 --> 00:23:23,593
So?

195
00:23:23,595 --> 00:23:26,051
The names of the authors
have been redacted,

196
00:23:26,053 --> 00:23:28,178
and two pages have been removed.

197
00:23:28,845 --> 00:23:32,301
Well, the State must
protect its secrets, Comrade.

198
00:23:32,303 --> 00:23:34,843
Do you dare suggest otherwise?

199
00:23:34,845 --> 00:23:37,178
They made a mistake.

200
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,845
They didn't redact
the table of contents.

201
00:23:52,803 --> 00:23:54,384
The missing pages apparently refer

202
00:23:54,387 --> 00:23:58,304
to a positive void coefficient and AZ-5.

203
00:23:59,219 --> 00:24:00,676
Does that mean anything to you?

204
00:24:00,678 --> 00:24:03,176
What are you after here?
Why are you asking me this?

205
00:24:03,178 --> 00:24:05,551
You worked with the reactor.
You know it better than I do.

206
00:24:05,553 --> 00:24:08,718
So everything's my fault, then?

207
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,843
Is that what this is?

208
00:24:09,845 --> 00:24:11,148
I'm not here to blame you.

209
00:24:11,151 --> 00:24:13,732
I'm here to find out what happened.

210
00:24:13,735 --> 00:24:15,426
And whether you realize it or not,

211
00:24:15,428 --> 00:24:17,678
I'm your best chance to avoid a bullet.

212
00:24:20,345 --> 00:24:22,136
Can you help me or not?

213
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:33,051
I have no idea what would've gone here.

214
00:24:33,053 --> 00:24:36,094
Void coefficients have
nothing to do with AZ-5.

215
00:24:37,011 --> 00:24:39,092
There. Now you can go.

216
00:24:39,094 --> 00:24:41,887
- You're not even curious?
- What for?

217
00:24:43,053 --> 00:24:46,386
You think the right question
will get you the truth?

218
00:24:47,553 --> 00:24:49,760
There is no truth.

219
00:24:49,762 --> 00:24:53,718
Ask the bosses whatever you
want and you'll get the lie.

220
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,053
And I will get the bullet.

221
00:26:29,136 --> 00:26:31,065
I only have two rules.

222
00:26:31,068 --> 00:26:32,884
One.

223
00:26:32,887 --> 00:26:35,967
Don't point this gun at
me. That's easy, right?

224
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:37,967
You can point it at this piece of shit.

225
00:26:37,969 --> 00:26:40,176
I don't give a fuck. Never me.

226
00:26:40,178 --> 00:26:42,051
Two.

227
00:26:42,053 --> 00:26:45,509
If you hit an animal and it doesn't die,

228
00:26:45,511 --> 00:26:48,301
keep shooting until it does.

229
00:26:48,303 --> 00:26:52,384
Don't let them suffer, or I'll kill you.

230
00:26:52,386 --> 00:26:54,417
Understand?

231
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,753
I mean it.

232
00:26:57,011 --> 00:26:58,969
I've killed a lot of people.

233
00:27:03,969 --> 00:27:06,553
Good. Then we're ready.

234
00:27:46,011 --> 00:27:49,593
Once we start, they'll run
inside where they feel safe.

235
00:27:49,595 --> 00:27:51,678
So we go door-to-door.

236
00:27:52,717 --> 00:27:54,173
Okay?

237
00:27:54,176 --> 00:27:55,677
Good.

238
00:28:45,862 --> 00:28:47,009
Hey!

239
00:28:47,011 --> 00:28:49,969
Do your job. Door-to-door.

240
00:29:43,803 --> 00:29:46,051
Go. Go.

241
00:29:46,053 --> 00:29:48,511
Go away. Go!

242
00:30:44,511 --> 00:30:46,426
Don't let them suffer.

243
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:48,386
Sorry. Sorry.

244
00:30:50,428 --> 00:30:52,928
You're dragging that to the truck.

245
00:31:29,928 --> 00:31:31,428
You gonna eat?

246
00:31:42,136 --> 00:31:43,470
Drink.

247
00:31:47,136 --> 00:31:48,470
Again.

248
00:32:00,595 --> 00:32:01,845
Look...

249
00:32:04,303 --> 00:32:06,637
This happens to everyone
their first time.

250
00:32:07,553 --> 00:32:09,928
Normally when you kill a man.

251
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:13,301
But for you, a dog.

252
00:32:13,303 --> 00:32:15,553
So what? There's no shame in it.

253
00:32:17,678 --> 00:32:20,384
You remember your first time, Garo?

254
00:32:20,386 --> 00:32:24,011
My first time... Afghanistan.

255
00:32:26,053 --> 00:32:28,343
We were moving through a house,

256
00:32:28,345 --> 00:32:32,345
and suddenly a man was there
and I shot him in the stomach.

257
00:32:34,136 --> 00:32:36,303
Yeah, that's a real war story.

258
00:32:37,378 --> 00:32:39,668
They're never any good
stories like in the movies.

259
00:32:39,671 --> 00:32:41,550
They're shit.

260
00:32:41,553 --> 00:32:45,409
A man was there... boom, stomach.

261
00:32:47,862 --> 00:32:50,051
I was so scared, I didn't
pull the trigger again

262
00:32:50,053 --> 00:32:51,845
for the rest of the day.

263
00:32:53,928 --> 00:32:56,887
I thought, "Well, that's it, Bacho.

264
00:32:58,219 --> 00:33:00,551
You put a bullet in someone.

265
00:33:00,553 --> 00:33:02,885
You're not you anymore.

266
00:33:02,887 --> 00:33:04,845
You'll never be you again."

267
00:33:07,386 --> 00:33:09,217
But then you wake up the next morning,

268
00:33:09,219 --> 00:33:11,094
and you're still you.

269
00:33:12,178 --> 00:33:13,762
And you realize...

270
00:33:15,053 --> 00:33:17,593
that was you all along.

271
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:19,428
You just didn't know.

272
00:33:29,845 --> 00:33:32,428
The happiness of all mankind.

273
00:33:35,865 --> 00:33:37,407
What?

274
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,885
"Our goal is the
happiness of all mankind."

275
00:33:49,269 --> 00:33:50,520
Yeah.

276
00:33:55,255 --> 00:33:56,878
I'm happy.

277
00:33:56,881 --> 00:33:58,590
I'm happy every day.

278
00:34:01,261 --> 00:34:04,261
All right. Back to work.

279
00:34:05,762 --> 00:34:07,053
Come on.

280
00:35:25,386 --> 00:35:26,720
It's here.

281
00:35:55,511 --> 00:35:57,553
All right.

282
00:35:58,887 --> 00:36:00,343
Get over.

283
00:36:00,345 --> 00:36:02,428
Right. Hang on.

284
00:36:03,303 --> 00:36:05,345
Easy now. Careful.

285
00:36:05,348 --> 00:36:06,848
Hold it!

286
00:36:15,386 --> 00:36:16,678
Joker.

287
00:36:18,219 --> 00:36:20,926
It's what the Germans named it: "Joker."

288
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:23,928
- Is it ready?
- It's ready.

289
00:37:11,136 --> 00:37:13,509
Good signal.

290
00:37:13,511 --> 00:37:15,094
Cameras.

291
00:37:16,196 --> 00:37:17,696
Motors.

292
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:22,885
Motors, good. Signals, good.

293
00:37:22,887 --> 00:37:25,509
All right, let's take this easy.

294
00:37:25,511 --> 00:37:27,803
Forward one meter, reverse one meter.

295
00:37:30,053 --> 00:37:31,345
Forward one.

296
00:37:35,303 --> 00:37:36,762
Germans.

297
00:37:38,219 --> 00:37:39,637
Reverse one.

298
00:37:52,969 --> 00:37:54,969
Did you lose the signal?

299
00:37:59,511 --> 00:38:01,511
It's not the signal. It's the vehicle.

300
00:38:03,178 --> 00:38:04,637
It's dead.

301
00:38:10,637 --> 00:38:11,678
Shit.

302
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:18,343
Of course I know they're listening!

303
00:38:18,345 --> 00:38:20,509
I want them to hear! I
want them to hear it all!

304
00:38:20,511 --> 00:38:22,584
Do you know what we're doing here?!

305
00:38:22,587 --> 00:38:25,011
Tell those geniuses what they have done!

306
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:28,887
I don't give a fuck!

307
00:38:30,762 --> 00:38:32,843
Tell them! Go tell them! Ryzhkov!

308
00:38:32,845 --> 00:38:34,384
Go tell them he's a joke!

309
00:38:34,386 --> 00:38:36,051
Tell fucking Gorbachev!

310
00:38:36,053 --> 00:38:39,053
Tell them!

311
00:39:00,303 --> 00:39:03,551
The official position of the State

312
00:39:03,553 --> 00:39:05,843
is that a global nuclear catastrophe

313
00:39:05,845 --> 00:39:08,259
is not possible in the Soviet Union.

314
00:39:08,261 --> 00:39:12,885
They told the Germans that the
highest detected level of radiation

315
00:39:12,887 --> 00:39:14,724
was 2,000 roentgen.

316
00:39:15,928 --> 00:39:18,261
They gave them the propaganda number.

317
00:39:20,678 --> 00:39:23,053
That robot was never going to work.

318
00:39:27,261 --> 00:39:28,928
We need a new phone.

319
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:12,509
What if we don't clear it?

320
00:40:12,511 --> 00:40:14,593
We have to clear it.

321
00:40:14,595 --> 00:40:18,595
If we don't clear the roof,
we can't build a cover over it.

322
00:40:20,511 --> 00:40:23,550
If we can't cover it,
that's 12,000 roentgen.

323
00:40:23,553 --> 00:40:28,099
That's nearly twice the
radiation from the Hiroshima bomb.

324
00:40:28,102 --> 00:40:32,217
- Every hour, hour after...
- I know, I know, I know.

325
00:40:32,219 --> 00:40:34,178
What about lead?

326
00:40:35,511 --> 00:40:37,009
We could... I don't know.

327
00:40:37,011 --> 00:40:40,307
We could melt it and pour it
from above, like a coating.

328
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:43,259
First of all, we've already
used most of the lead we had...

329
00:40:43,261 --> 00:40:45,509
There's lead sheeting
around the instruments

330
00:40:45,511 --> 00:40:47,301
in the other reactor buildings.

331
00:40:47,303 --> 00:40:50,259
The soldiers are stripping
it for their armor.

332
00:40:50,261 --> 00:40:52,011
Are you serious?

333
00:40:53,678 --> 00:40:56,801
Even if, we're still talking about

334
00:40:56,803 --> 00:40:58,926
boiling metal in a helicopter.

335
00:40:58,928 --> 00:41:01,553
And it's lead, Boris,
it'll weight a ton.

336
00:41:03,959 --> 00:41:07,325
What if we shoot the
graphite into the hole?

337
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:10,284
We've got high-caliber
bullets, exploding bullets.

338
00:41:10,287 --> 00:41:12,301
They wouldn't just
ricochet, they'd push...

339
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,718
You wanna shoot exploding bullets

340
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,635
at an exposed nuclear reactor?

341
00:41:16,637 --> 00:41:18,885
- Well...
- No, no.

342
00:41:18,887 --> 00:41:20,909
Let's go light that roof back on fire.

343
00:41:20,912 --> 00:41:23,967
It was so easy to put
out the first time.

344
00:41:23,969 --> 00:41:27,511
What are we talking about here?

345
00:41:29,094 --> 00:41:31,178
We need another robot.

346
00:41:32,053 --> 00:41:34,926
One that can withstand the radiation.

347
00:41:34,928 --> 00:41:37,386
I've asked. There is nothing.

348
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,468
The Americans?

349
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:42,426
If the Americans had
that kind of technology,

350
00:41:42,428 --> 00:41:44,301
do you really think
they'd give it to us?

351
00:41:44,303 --> 00:41:47,343
And even if they would, the Central
Committee will never stoop to ask.

352
00:41:47,345 --> 00:41:49,053
You know it, I know it.

353
00:41:50,178 --> 00:41:52,053
There are no robots.

354
00:41:58,511 --> 00:42:00,926
Biorobots.

355
00:42:00,928 --> 00:42:02,595
What was that?

356
00:42:07,094 --> 00:42:10,720
We use biorobots.

357
00:42:13,326 --> 00:42:14,701
Men.

358
00:43:43,261 --> 00:43:44,678
A lot today.

359
00:43:49,845 --> 00:43:52,011
Where do they get their food?

360
00:43:54,011 --> 00:43:55,887
They eat the chickens.

361
00:43:56,553 --> 00:43:58,511
Then they eat each other.

362
00:44:09,303 --> 00:44:10,887
Door-to-door.

363
00:45:22,862 --> 00:45:24,753
Pavel?

364
00:45:29,271 --> 00:45:30,977
Pavel!

365
00:45:39,303 --> 00:45:42,470
You don't hear me? I'm talking to you.

366
00:45:44,417 --> 00:45:46,000
Fuck.

367
00:45:50,887 --> 00:45:52,760
Just go outside.

368
00:45:59,136 --> 00:46:00,511
Go.

369
00:48:53,969 --> 00:48:55,718
Comrade soldiers,

370
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:58,509
the Soviet people have had
enough of this accident.

371
00:48:58,511 --> 00:49:00,176
They want us to clean this up,

372
00:49:00,178 --> 00:49:02,926
and we have entrusted you
with this serious task.

373
00:49:02,928 --> 00:49:05,301
Because of the nature
of the working area,

374
00:49:05,303 --> 00:49:09,343
you will each have no more than
90 seconds to solve this problem.

375
00:49:09,345 --> 00:49:12,301
Listen carefully to
each of my instructions,

376
00:49:12,303 --> 00:49:14,843
and do exactly as you have been told.

377
00:49:14,845 --> 00:49:19,593
This is for your own safety
and the safety of your comrades.

378
00:49:19,595 --> 00:49:21,967
You will enter Reactor Building Three,

379
00:49:21,969 --> 00:49:25,801
climb the stairs but do not
immediately proceed to the roof.

380
00:49:25,803 --> 00:49:27,885
When you get to the top, wait inside,

381
00:49:27,887 --> 00:49:30,967
behind the entrance to the
roof and catch your breath.

382
00:49:30,969 --> 00:49:33,593
You will need it for what comes next.

383
00:49:33,595 --> 00:49:36,718
This is the working area.
We must clear the graphite.

384
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:40,301
Some of it is in blocks, weighing
approximately 40 to 50 kilograms.

385
00:49:40,303 --> 00:49:42,509
They all must be thrown
over the edge here.

386
00:49:42,511 --> 00:49:46,509
Watch your comrades moving
fast from this opening,

387
00:49:46,511 --> 00:49:48,176
then turning to the left,

388
00:49:48,178 --> 00:49:50,384
and entering the workspace here.

389
00:49:50,386 --> 00:49:52,092
Take care not to stumble.

390
00:49:52,094 --> 00:49:55,676
There's a hole in the
roof. Take care not to fall.

391
00:49:55,678 --> 00:50:00,468
You will need to move quickly, and
you will need to move carefully.

392
00:50:00,470 --> 00:50:03,092
Do you understand your
mission as I have described it?

393
00:50:03,094 --> 00:50:05,051
Yes, Comrade General.

394
00:50:05,053 --> 00:50:08,551
These are the most important
90 seconds of your lives.

395
00:50:08,553 --> 00:50:11,969
Commit your task to
memory, then do your job.

396
00:50:54,969 --> 00:50:58,114
It's time to go. After 90
seconds, I will ring a bell.

397
00:50:58,117 --> 00:51:00,008
When you hear it, return immediately,

398
00:51:00,011 --> 00:51:01,384
drop your shovels in the bin,

399
00:51:01,387 --> 00:51:04,216
and proceed down the
hallway for decontamination.

400
00:51:04,219 --> 00:51:06,009
Above all, while on the roof,

401
00:51:06,011 --> 00:51:07,551
throw your debris over the rail.

402
00:51:07,553 --> 00:51:09,461
Do not look over the
rail. Is that clear?

403
00:51:10,465 --> 00:51:11,920
Very well.

404
00:51:11,923 --> 00:51:14,672
On my mark. Ready. Go.

405
00:52:54,053 --> 00:52:56,011
Whoa!

406
00:53:27,506 --> 00:53:28,637
Comrade soldier.

407
00:53:30,248 --> 00:53:31,748
You're done.

408
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:45,301
Time to go.

409
00:53:58,026 --> 00:54:00,485
Oh! Your glove!

410
00:54:20,334 --> 00:54:21,928
Mommy! Mommy!

411
00:55:26,428 --> 00:55:28,760
I'm sorry for all this.

412
00:55:28,762 --> 00:55:32,509
But we needed to speak to
you somewhere without...

413
00:55:32,511 --> 00:55:35,509
They're going to put Dyatlov on trial,

414
00:55:35,511 --> 00:55:37,885
and Bryukhanov and Fomin.

415
00:55:37,887 --> 00:55:41,885
We're going to be asked
to give expert testimony,

416
00:55:41,887 --> 00:55:43,468
all three of us.

417
00:55:43,470 --> 00:55:46,051
But that's... Before that happens...

418
00:55:46,053 --> 00:55:49,593
The Central Committee is
sending Legasov to Vienna.

419
00:55:49,595 --> 00:55:51,768
It's the headquarters
of the International...

420
00:55:51,771 --> 00:55:55,053
Atomic Energy Agency. Yeah,
I know what's in Vienna.

421
00:55:56,845 --> 00:55:58,593
What are they asking you to do?

422
00:55:58,595 --> 00:56:01,637
Tell the world what happened.

423
00:56:06,261 --> 00:56:08,676
Well, then you better
know what happened.

424
00:56:08,678 --> 00:56:10,718
I've constructed a timeline,

425
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,384
minute by minute.

426
00:56:12,386 --> 00:56:15,551
Second by second in some places.

427
00:56:15,553 --> 00:56:17,426
Every decision, every button push,

428
00:56:17,428 --> 00:56:19,593
every turn of a switch.

429
00:56:19,595 --> 00:56:22,551
And? Are they guilty?

430
00:56:22,553 --> 00:56:24,009
Yes.

431
00:56:24,011 --> 00:56:28,092
Of gross incompetence,
violation of safety regulations,

432
00:56:28,094 --> 00:56:30,343
recklessness beyond belief.

433
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:33,009
But the explosion? I'm not sure.

434
00:56:33,011 --> 00:56:35,345
What do you mean you're not sure?

435
00:56:36,178 --> 00:56:38,343
I've analyzed the data.

436
00:56:38,345 --> 00:56:40,593
Toptunov was telling the truth.

437
00:56:40,595 --> 00:56:43,969
They shut the reactor
down, and then it exploded.

438
00:56:45,386 --> 00:56:48,843
I think this article my have the answer,

439
00:56:48,845 --> 00:56:52,303
but two pages have been removed.

440
00:56:57,845 --> 00:56:59,801
You've seen this before.

441
00:56:59,803 --> 00:57:02,635
Please, believe me when I tell you that

442
00:57:02,637 --> 00:57:05,134
I had no idea it could
cause an explosion.

443
00:57:05,136 --> 00:57:08,136
- None of us knew.
- None of you knew what?

444
00:57:09,428 --> 00:57:12,834
In 1975, in an RBMK
reactor in Leningrad,

445
00:57:12,837 --> 00:57:14,926
a fuel channel ruptured.

446
00:57:14,928 --> 00:57:16,801
The operators pressed AZ-5,

447
00:57:16,803 --> 00:57:19,635
but instead of the power
going down immediately,

448
00:57:19,637 --> 00:57:22,593
for a brief moment it went up.

449
00:57:22,595 --> 00:57:24,282
How is that possible?

450
00:57:24,285 --> 00:57:25,885
Well, this was the very question posed

451
00:57:25,887 --> 00:57:27,885
by a colleague of mine named Volkov.

452
00:57:27,887 --> 00:57:29,926
He's the one who wrote this article.

453
00:57:29,928 --> 00:57:33,760
When an RBMK reactor runs at low
power, it's notoriously unstable.

454
00:57:33,762 --> 00:57:37,176
Prone to swings in reactivity.

455
00:57:37,178 --> 00:57:38,676
Under normal circumstances,

456
00:57:38,678 --> 00:57:40,593
the control rods can
compensate for that.

457
00:57:40,595 --> 00:57:42,051
Under normal circumstances.

458
00:57:42,053 --> 00:57:45,593
The Chernobyl staff stalled
the reactor during the test.

459
00:57:45,595 --> 00:57:47,509
They pulled almost all
the control rods out

460
00:57:47,516 --> 00:57:48,774
to bring the power back up.

461
00:57:48,777 --> 00:57:51,426
This is what Volkov
learned from Leningrad.

462
00:57:51,428 --> 00:57:52,926
If the boron control rods

463
00:57:52,928 --> 00:57:55,718
are completely withdrawn
from the reactor,

464
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:57,092
when they're put back in,

465
00:57:57,094 --> 00:58:00,301
the first thing that
enters the core isn't boron.

466
00:58:00,303 --> 00:58:02,511
It's graphite.

467
00:58:05,678 --> 00:58:08,009
The control rods have graphite tips

468
00:58:08,011 --> 00:58:10,509
that displace water and steam.

469
00:58:10,511 --> 00:58:12,926
So the reactivity doesn't go down.

470
00:58:12,928 --> 00:58:15,092
It goes up dramatically.

471
00:58:15,095 --> 00:58:18,551
Why on Earth would
they press that button?

472
00:58:18,553 --> 00:58:20,553
They didn't know.

473
00:58:22,386 --> 00:58:25,092
Volkov warned the Kremlin,

474
00:58:25,094 --> 00:58:26,845
ten years ago.

475
00:58:27,595 --> 00:58:30,217
But there could be no doubt

476
00:58:30,219 --> 00:58:34,176
about the supremacy of the
Soviet nuclear industry.

477
00:58:34,178 --> 00:58:36,092
Ah.

478
00:58:36,094 --> 00:58:39,762
The KGB classified it as a state secret.

479
00:58:41,685 --> 00:58:43,593
When I saw the reactor blown open,

480
00:58:43,595 --> 00:58:47,134
I still didn't think it
could be this flaw in AZ-5.

481
00:58:47,136 --> 00:58:50,259
Because the flaw will
not lead to an explosion

482
00:58:50,261 --> 00:58:55,509
unless the operators have pushed
the reactor to the edge of disaster.

483
00:58:55,511 --> 00:58:58,426
- So it is their fault?
- Yes.

484
00:58:58,428 --> 00:59:00,470
But not only their fault.

485
00:59:01,887 --> 00:59:03,386
No.

486
00:59:04,511 --> 00:59:07,094
Is that what you're
going to say in Vienna?

487
00:59:10,011 --> 00:59:13,092
You can't possibly be that naive.

488
00:59:13,094 --> 00:59:16,593
There are 16 RBMK reactors

489
00:59:16,595 --> 00:59:19,468
running in the Soviet Union right now.

490
00:59:19,470 --> 00:59:21,509
We have to fix them.

491
00:59:21,511 --> 00:59:24,301
The only way to do that is to go public,

492
00:59:24,303 --> 00:59:26,384
force the Central
Committee to take action.

493
00:59:26,386 --> 00:59:29,468
What you're proposing is that
Legasov humiliate a nation

494
00:59:29,470 --> 00:59:32,551
that is obsessed with
not being humiliated.

495
00:59:32,553 --> 00:59:35,092
We can make a deal with the KGB.

496
00:59:35,094 --> 00:59:37,259
You'll leave this
information out in Vienna,

497
00:59:37,261 --> 00:59:40,468
and they quietly let us
fix the remaining reactors.

498
00:59:40,470 --> 00:59:42,885
A deal with the KGB?

499
00:59:42,887 --> 00:59:44,595
And I'm "naive."

500
00:59:45,845 --> 00:59:49,384
They'll go after your family,
they'll go after your friends.

501
00:59:49,386 --> 00:59:52,301
You have a chance to
talk to the world, Valery.

502
00:59:52,303 --> 00:59:54,259
If that chance was mine...

503
00:59:54,261 --> 00:59:55,928
But it isn't, is it?

504
00:59:57,178 --> 01:00:00,384
I've know braver souls
than you, Khomyuk.

505
01:00:00,386 --> 01:00:02,635
Men who had their
moment and did nothing.

506
01:00:02,637 --> 01:00:06,843
Because when it's your life and
the lives of everyone you love,

507
01:00:06,845 --> 01:00:09,551
your moral conviction
doesn't mean anything.

508
01:00:09,553 --> 01:00:11,760
It leaves you.

509
01:00:11,762 --> 01:00:16,303
And all you want at that
moment is not to be shot.

510
01:00:20,345 --> 01:00:22,801
Do you know the name Vasily Ignatenko?

511
01:00:22,803 --> 01:00:24,345
No.

512
01:00:25,678 --> 01:00:28,509
He was a fireman.

513
01:00:28,511 --> 01:00:31,676
He died two weeks after the accident.

514
01:00:31,678 --> 01:00:34,438
I've been looking in on his widow.

515
01:00:34,441 --> 01:00:36,309
She gave birth.

516
01:00:36,312 --> 01:00:38,008
A girl.

517
01:00:38,011 --> 01:00:40,303
The baby lived for four hours.

518
01:00:41,219 --> 01:00:43,426
They said the radiation
would have killed the mother,

519
01:00:43,428 --> 01:00:45,899
but the baby absorbed it instead.

520
01:00:45,902 --> 01:00:47,319
Her baby.

521
01:00:49,178 --> 01:00:50,801
We live in a country

522
01:00:50,803 --> 01:00:53,511
where children have to
die to save their mothers.

523
01:00:54,762 --> 01:00:56,887
To hell with your deal.

524
01:00:58,887 --> 01:01:01,219
And to hell with our lives.

525
01:01:02,803 --> 01:01:05,053
Someone has to start telling the truth.

526
01:01:19,219 --> 01:01:21,676
Congratulations, comrades.

527
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:25,301
You are the last of 3,828 men.

528
01:01:25,303 --> 01:01:28,051
You have performed
your duties perfectly.

529
01:01:28,053 --> 01:01:30,551
I wish you good health and long life.

530
01:01:30,553 --> 01:01:33,509
All of you are awarded
a bonus of 800 rubles.

531
01:01:33,511 --> 01:01:49,678
- Thank you.
- I serve the Soviet Union.

532
01:05:48,143 --> 01:05:49,986
This session of court is now open.

533
01:05:51,011 --> 01:05:53,094
The state calls Comrade Khomyuk.

534
01:05:53,097 --> 01:05:55,760
To understand what happened that night,

535
01:05:55,762 --> 01:05:58,586
we have to go back to
the first critical moment.

536
01:05:58,589 --> 01:06:00,565
The time is 28 past midnight.

537
01:06:03,678 --> 01:06:06,718
At the trial, you're
going to tell the truth.

538
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:08,926
1:22 a.m.

539
01:06:08,928 --> 01:06:11,051
Once it's over, we
will have our villains.

540
01:06:11,053 --> 01:06:14,176
We will have our hero.
We will have our truth.

541
01:06:14,178 --> 01:06:16,926
1:23 and 35 seconds.

542
01:06:16,928 --> 01:06:19,468
Comrade Boris Shcherbina.

543
01:06:19,470 --> 01:06:22,635
It began with... a safety test.

544
01:06:22,637 --> 01:06:24,456
1:23:42.

545
01:06:25,219 --> 01:06:29,136
They died rescuing each
other. Putting out fires.

546
01:06:29,139 --> 01:06:30,885
Tending to the wounded.

547
01:06:30,887 --> 01:06:32,633
1:23:45.

548
01:06:32,636 --> 01:06:34,886
When your testimony arrives,

549
01:06:34,889 --> 01:06:36,926
insist on reform.

550
01:06:36,928 --> 01:06:39,134
I've already given my life.

551
01:06:39,136 --> 01:06:41,301
Isn't that enough?

552
01:06:41,303 --> 01:06:43,523
The state calls Comrade Legasov.
