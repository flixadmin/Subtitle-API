00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,488
Mr. Hastings, about your daughter,
and we know that this is difficult...

156
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:56,048
...but did she have anyone in her life
that worried you?

157
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,603
- Anyone who might have wished her harm?
- Everybody loved my Amanda.

158
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,731
Mr. Hastings, are you all right?

159
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,202
Robert, if you need to take a moment,
I'm sure it will be all right.

160
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,528
Absolutely.

161
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,124
Come on.

162
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,370
I know you gentlemen
are working against the clock...

163
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,406
...but I'm afraid Mr. and Mrs. Hastings
might not be ready for this.

164
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,689
I can see that. And you are
the Hastings' therapist, Dr. Marks?

165
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:37,084
Yes. I treat mostly Mr. Hastings,
but we've had many family sessions.

166
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:42,770
Mr. Hastings has a very delicate nature.

167
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,440
He's not capable
of dealing with this kind of tragedy.

168
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,081
No one's capable of dealing
with this kind of tragedy.

169
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,526
It's a freight train.

170
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,566
It runs you over,
and you try to pick up what's left.

171
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,405
You don't believe in treatment.

172
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,524
I believe in the tranquilizers
you clobbered Mrs. Hastings with.

173
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,768
- If you're giving out samples...
- Okay. Uh...

174
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,209
- Detective, maybe we should, uh...
BULLOCK: Yeah, you're right, we should.

175
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,970
Excuse me.

176
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,282
- Thank you, doctor.
MARKS: Mm-hm.

177
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,361
KRINGLE:
Uh-huh. All right, got it.

178
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,281
And got it.
Yes, sir, I'll bring those files right away.

179
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:24,365
- Mr. Nygma.
- Hello, Miss Kringle.

180
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,484
[SNIFFS]

181
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,130
I'm just looking for all the information you
have on the Goat murders from 10 years ago.

182
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,291
Don't you find it curious...

183
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,929
...why someone would resurrect the myth
of a centuries-old bogeyman?

184
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,250
What is it about the Goat that has made
two people decide to kill in his name?

185
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,727
No, I don't find it curious.

186
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,924
- I think I would like your parents.
- Excuse me?

187
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:54,164
Kringle. Such a rare surname.

188
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,449
Most people changed it generations ago
out of embarrassment.

189
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:01,850
Not only did your parents keep it,
they called you Kristin.

190
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,522
Kristin Kringle. Ha, ha.

191
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:08,162
They must be very humorous people.
Humor is so important, don't you think?

192
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,971
Remember,
you have to sign out any evidence you pull.

193
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,970
How do you find anything at all in here?

194
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,845
I mean, organizationally speaking,
this place is a shambles.

195
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,605
I am warning you, Nygma.

196
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,924
I have this as exactly as I want it.
I know where everything is.

197
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,363
- Understand?
- Preternaturally.

198
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,289
But...

199
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,604
...I can help you, Kristin Kringle.

200
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,045
I doubt that very much.

201
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,322
There is a much better way to do this.

202
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:51,811
Amanda Hastings was last seen
entering this building Tuesday midnight.

203
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,161
That's about 36 hours ago.

204
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,322
GORDON:
You think she was abducted from here?

205
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,040
I don't know.
It was Milkie's MO 10 years ago.

206
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,726
He took each one of the victims
from their homes.

207
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:05,363
- But CSI found no signs of a break-in.
- They didn't with Randall either.

208
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,006
He worked for an air-conditioning
maintenance crew...

209
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,850
...that covered all three buildings.

210
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,246
He had keys?

211
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,201
He had keys.

212
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,406
This is Detective Gordon.

213
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,843
I need the employee list of every
maintenance and janitorial company...

214
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,401
...with access to the Hastings' building.

215
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,682
Yeah, I'll tell him.

216
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,242
They're ready for the autopsy.

217
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,767
Mother!

218
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,402
GERTRUD: Away for so long,
and now he scratches at the door...

219
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,602
...the filthy tomcat.

220
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,771
Hi, Mom. I'm alive.

221
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,284
Why you always think I'm running off
with some painted lady?

222
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,568
- I don't even date.
- Ha!

223
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:02,721
Why you don't call your mother
in all this time? I tell you why.

224
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,282
You got tangled
in some hussy's demon purse.

225
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,443
Mother, there was no hussy.

226
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,923
Only betrayal and savagery and...

227
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,246
All I wanted was a little respect.

228
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,283
And they hurt me so cruelly.

229
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,042
- Oh. There was no other woman?
- Heh-heh-heh.

230
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,925
I have been to hell and back.
They tried to kill me.

231
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:32,967
The bullies again. My poor, poor darling.

232
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:38,610
They only do these things
because they resent you.

233
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,289
Envy and spite...

234
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,801
...that's all it is.

235
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,088
You watch, Ma.

236
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,244
I'm gonna be somebody in this town.

237
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,764
I always knew this.

238
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,600
The victim was asphyxiated,
likely with ether or chloroform.

239
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,531
Look under the scalp.

240
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,921
Humor me.

241
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:12,765
At the base of the skull,
there'd be an incision about an inch long...

242
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,281
...sewn closed.

243
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,811
EXAMINER:
Wait a minute.

244
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,367
Yes. How did I miss that?

245
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,844
An incision stitched closed
near the occipital.

246
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,202
Over a foreign object.

247
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,047
- What is it?
- It's a penny.

248
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,848
He's right.

249
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,204
- A penny?
- I know Milkie's MO.

250
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,042
No one could know that detail.

251
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,249
It isn't a copycat.

252
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,045
It can't be.

253
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,885
BULLOCK: Ten years ago Randall Milkie
took an 1813 Liberty penny just like this one...

254
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,646
...and sewed it into the heads
of each of his victims.

255
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,251
Why?

256
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,370
How the hell do I know?
He bum-rushed me wearing animal horns.

257
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:07,565
- I shot him. We didn't talk coin collecting.
- You're sure no one else found this out?

258
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,929
Milkie was the definition of a loner.
He didn't tell anybody.

259
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:14,402
- We left it out of the file intentionally.
- Suppressed evidence.

260
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,607
We Easter-egged it.

261
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,764
A killer like the Goat had a good chance
of drawing admirers.

262
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,684
Yeah, it's copycat porn.

263
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,562
We left out this one detail. The coins.
It never hit the papers.

264
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,922
How the hell did this copy-Goat know
about this?

265
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:30,880
Okay, so you hid it,
but the medical examiner, he had to know.

266
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:35,085
Ed Hayes, yeah, sure.
But he died of cirrhosis. That just leaves me.

267
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,771
And Dix.

268
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,446
- Captain, please, there's no reason--
- Go talk to him.

269
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,001
Make sure he didn't tell anyone
about the coins.

270
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,924
Hell, see if he's got any ideas.

- Yeah.

277
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,249
I don't know why he chose an ungulate
for his totem...

278
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,249
...but he does know how to scare them.

You do realize you happen to be one of them,
don't you, Master Bruce?

00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,403
Yeah, a firstborn son of Gotham's rich

Pop down to the lake house.
You like it there.

I'm not going anywhere.

284
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,488
I have work to do.

Besides...

286
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,243
...why would the Goat take me?

287
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,124
There's no one to take me from.

288

- Oh, my God.
- I'm improving your system.

289
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:01,210
Implementing a rhizomatic cross index,
with your case files classified by subject...

290

...but arranged more like the way
a peat-moss organism grows.

291
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,649
You know, laterally.

292
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:11,687
- I had this entire room organized.
- Yes, but now it will be rhizomatic. Lateral.

293
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,691
What did I ever do to you, Nygma?

294
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:19,130
What did I do that compels you to come here
with your endless suggestions and riddles?

295
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,722
My god, the riddles.
Are you trying to get me to quit?

296
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,371
- You can't want my job.
- No, no, no. I want you.

297
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,649
To keep your job and to have it here...

...for working.

299
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,244
Okay.

300
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,241
I'm getting a sense
that this was somehow inappropriate.

301
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,881
You are so odd.

302
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,570
I'll just take my nonhierarchical data
paradigms out of your hair...

Bullock, I know what happened.
Anybody in your situation--

That's good.

518
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:50,365
To be honest, I wanted to talk to you
about one of your pro bono patients.

519
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:55,282
Raymond Earl.
He's a person of interest in our investigation.

520
00:37:55,480 --> 00:38:00,042
Our records indicate you've seen him
at least a few times, right?

521
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,329
Hmm. Sounds familiar. Last year, maybe?

522
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:07,525
And Mr. Hastings, Amanda's father,
we know he's your patient.

523
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:11,611
When we were here yesterday,
he was doing something really curious.

524
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:15,441
He kept clenching his fist, over and over.

525
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,483
- Yes, he does that.
- Yeah.

526
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:21,531
See, I was reading about that,
and it said that if a patient has a compulsion...

527
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,802
...like a bad idea or an impulse...

528
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,571
...that the hypnotist
can put the poor sap under...

529
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,371
...and introduce a physical movement...

530
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,847
...like clenching your fist.

531
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:35,362
So instead of doing what the compulsion
wants the person to do...

532
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,608
...they just...

533
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,245
...clench their fist.

534
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,484
That's how it works. Pretty much.

535
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:45,122
So Mr. Hastings,
when he's in a room full of people...

536
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,721
...and he wants to start screaming,
I don't know...

537
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,764
...instead of doing that, he just:

538
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,925
Mm-hm.

539
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,003
Yeah. Okay.

540
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,647
What about Raymond Earl?
Why does he clench his fist?

541
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,449
And What about Randall Milkie?

542
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,602
I know you treated him over 10 years ago,
and I want you to follow me...

543
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,285
...because this part gets weird.

544
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:13,240
See, I think a hypnotist completely
turned both those men upside down...

545
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,568
...until their own identity was the bad idea...

546
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,082
...and then it wasn't even them
clenching their fists anymore.

547
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,123
It was the Spirit of the Goat.

548
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,691
Hmm.

549
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,090
I underestimated you.

550
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,921
- I really did.
- So I'm right.

551
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,401
Aha! Yes. I'm right.

552
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,404
So you trawled the outpatient clinics...

553
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:38,803
...so you could find a suitable
borderline case like Randall Milkie...

554
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,965
...and then you hypnotize the poor bastard
until he doesn't even know who he is.

555
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,682
And then I tell him who he is.
That's pretty good intellection, detective.

556
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,566
Why? Why hypnotize a janitor...

557
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,250
...and turn him into the Goat?

558
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:55,171
- You wouldn't understand.
- Try me.

559
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:58,962
It isn't an act of murder or madness.
It's an act of therapy.

560
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:01,811
- Therapy? For who?
- For Gotham.

561
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:06,607
- Excuse me?
- This city used to have hope.

562
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:10,003
And they gunned it down in the streets,
the rich, the powerful.

563
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:14,842
Their greed is pathological,
an id run rampant, eating Gotham alive.

564
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:18,402
So your 1 percent solution
is to kill the city's rich kids?

Gotham wanted that,
no matter how painful it was.
