ORIGINAL STORY <i>SWEET HOME</i>
BY CARNBY KIM AND YOUNGCHAN HWANG

3
00:00:58,183 --> 00:00:59,809
What was that?

4
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:02,312
Our plan must've failed.

5
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:53,154
I can't give you anesthesia.

6
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,448
You could die from shock.

7
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,159
Even if the surgery is successful,

8
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:01,788
you could die from infection.

9
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,124
I won't blame you.

10
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:07,961
I promise.

11
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:34,904
Get lost, you son of a bitch!

12
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:16,529
Live.

13
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,679
Pick them up.
We have to protect this place.

14
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,917
Hey! Wake up!

15
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:33,221
What do you think will happen?

16
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,600
It's your turn from now on.

17
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,187
Because it all depends on God.

18
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:44,106
No.

19
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:47,401
It depends on Ji-su.

20
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:49,987
<i>Don't worry.</i>

21
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,698
<i>Ji-su will wake up no matter what.</i>

22
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,035
How can you be sure?

23
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:02,375
She said she grabbed thread
at her first birthday ceremony.

24
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,569
Did you sell my baby off?

25
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,153
Why did you come back with that junk?

26
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:35,658
I'm sorry.

27
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:37,952
How was she?

28
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:39,662
Did she run fast?

29
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:43,374
Yes.

30
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:47,837
That's good.

31
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:53,009
She'll have no regrets, either, then.

32
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:00,600
I could only find one.

33
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:06,689
Guess it was worth it after all.

34
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,776
You've got a lot of visitors.

35
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:14,947
Is Hyun-su okay?

36
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:17,158
So he's the first thing you ask about.

37
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:19,952
Answer me.
Did he have any strange symptoms?

38
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:22,538
-What about you?
-What?

39
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,833
To me, you and Hyun-su are similar.

40
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,084
What do you mean?

41
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,003
Seon-yeong told me

42
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,380
that you're pregnant.

43
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,135
It's something I had to know.

44
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:37,053
So?

45
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:39,180
Are you going to lock me up?

46
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,266
I can't do that.

47
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,393
You aren't a monster yet.

48
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:46,979
You are a time bomb, though.

49
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:51,067
-I won't tell people.
-Do whatever you want.

50
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,861
I've never done that.

51
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,988
I've only done what I had to.

52
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,369
Now tell me what it's like outside

53
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:03,496
and how you were able to return safely.

54
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,581
-Tell me every detail.
-You first.

55
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,794
Tell me what's happened here
and how Hyun-su has been.

56
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,047
Tell me every tiny detail.

57
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:14,632
Everything.

58
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,459
You should've come out when you woke up.

59
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,086
Why are you still in here?

60
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,588
I was hiding from you.

61
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:08,185
VENTOLIN INHALATION AEROSOL

62
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,565
Where did you get this?

63
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:14,608
Never mind that.

64
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:17,778
Take care of yourself.

65
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:18,696
Okay?

66
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:31,667
What an ignorant idiot!

67
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,763
That's his way of saying thank you.

68
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:02,406
You're back.

69
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:05,576
Is this your daily routine?

70
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:08,537
There's nothing to steal here,
but you're so diligent.

71
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:12,708
A rat's been sneaking in and out.

72
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:28,766
What are you doing?

73
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:37,608
What did you grab
at your first birthday ceremony?

74
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:39,902
What?

75
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:45,282
You know. You put out things like
a pencil, money, thread

76
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:47,868
in front of the baby.

77
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,663
If they pick up a pencil,
they'll be smart.

78
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:52,623
If they pick up money, they'll be rich.

79
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,418
If they grab thread,
they'll live a long life.

80
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:00,297
You know the custom.

81
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:09,515
I don't remember.

82
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:11,475
Come on.

83
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,352
Of course, you don't remember.

84
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:16,730
Either your parents tell you
or you see it from pictures.

85
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:19,984
Mine were all burned.

86
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,325
I have nothing left.

87
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:33,998
I learned that

88
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:38,252
God won't let you be tempted
beyond what you can bear.

89
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:45,092
But I think God overestimates humans.

90
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,413
<i>That boy you mentioned.</i>

91
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:16,457
<i>He better have survived</i>
<i>longer than 15 days.</i>

92
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,267
What are you doing?

93
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:42,942
What was the first symptom?

94
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:45,527
A nosebleed? Passing out?

95
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,613
When was it exactly?

96
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,657
-What?
-Try to remember.

97
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,910
You must remember
because it's the day you became a monster.

98
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,206
I heard it speaks to you.

99
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:58,999
Did it speak to you?

100
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:02,753
Yes.

101
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:08,092
Have you ever completely escaped from it?

102
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:13,681
You have, right? How?

103
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:16,558
Tell me!

104
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,732
I just wanted to live.

105
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,294
Why are you doing this to me?

106
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,716
There were more people
who tried to resist monsterization.

107
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:51,802
The government carried out
experiments on them

108
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,681
to find a way to stop this disaster.

109
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:56,765
Was the experiment

110
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,308
successful?

111
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,231
You should be asking me

112
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:07,609
what happened to the people
who were used in the experiment.

113
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,036
I ran into soldiers.

114
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:19,872
They caught me, to be exact.

115
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,503
I told them about you.

116
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:28,964
I…

117
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:38,223
wanted to live, too.

118
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:20,516
All right.

119
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:25,145
-Nice.
-This is so refreshing.

120
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,105
One more time, please.

121
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:33,987
Ms. Cha.

122
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:38,784
I thought you were tan,
but you were just dirty.

123
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:40,702
Thanks.

124
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,996
I'm saying you look good now.

125
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:46,792
I got these in the mail.

126
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:48,710
Do you want a face mask?

127
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:52,172
No, thanks.
I know I look pretty without it.

128
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:55,717
Wait, Seung-wan needs it.

129
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,678
No, I don't.

130
00:18:58,345 --> 00:18:59,179
I think…

131
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,892
I should go outside.

132
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:08,230
I'm starting to have symptoms.

133
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:14,403
I should've told you sooner.

134
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,114
I guess I didn't want to believe it.

135
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,116
I'm sorry.

136
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:22,578
I can't

137
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:26,039
put everyone in danger.

138
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:28,458
Before it's too late, I should go--

139
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,169
Still, you shouldn't go outside.

140
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:31,503
She's right.

141
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,756
You're still human.
You'll die if you go outside!

142
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,674
What?

143
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:37,092
I mean,

144
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,678
-we can't let her stay here.
-Quiet.

145
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:48,979
Why don't we hold a vote?

146
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:54,026
Just vote as you want.

147
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,154
Because this is like…

148
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,573
taking part in murder.

149
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,748
I vote she stays in the arcade.

150
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:09,958
I'm in favor.

151
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:12,502
Me, too.

152
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,589
She might be able to hold out
like Hyun-su.

153
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:48,872
PINOCCHIO DAYCARE

154
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,002
How are you feeling?

155
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,760
Women should always keep
their bodies warm.

156
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:04,721
Especially you, Yi-kyung.

157
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:10,894
Take care of yourself.

158
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,121
Seon-yeong.

159
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:31,206
Well…

160
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,751
Please don't be too upset about this

161
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:37,087
or about Seok-hyeon.

162
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:38,422
I'm sorry.

163
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:40,465
It's okay.

164
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:42,009
Thank you.

165
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:43,885
Seon-yeong.

166
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:46,471
You'll be fine.

167
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:51,018
Let's meet again. Okay?

168
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:51,935
Okay.

169
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:54,062
Take care.

170
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:18,420
Ms. An.

171
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:25,510
How did you bear it?

172
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:36,396
How did you do it?

173
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:43,195
Now I know what you've been through,
but there's nothing I can do for you.

174
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:55,123
I'm sorry for being

175
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:57,501
an awful grownup.

176
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,752
I could definitely use a drink
on a day like this.

177
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,045
There you go again.

178
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:44,256
That's why you have terrible skin.

179
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:47,259
Well,

180
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:50,720
don't you think Ms. An can hold out
like Hyun-su?

181
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:53,432
I really hope so.

182
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,100
I thought it was just her husband,

183
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:56,726
but her whole life is awful.

184
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:59,563
Your face is awful.

185
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:01,690
I agree with Byeong-il.

186
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:05,193
We could definitely use a drink today.

187
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,028
What is this? Is this Korean wine?

188
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:09,364
The color's stunning.

189
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,658
It's too good to drink.
Can we really drink it?

190
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:20,792
It's at least four years old.

191
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,631
This could be as good as medicine.

192
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,263
Yu-ri left earlier by the way.

193
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,807
Shall we finish this off
before Eun-hyeok comes?

194
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,278
Speak of the devil.

195
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:51,364
Just don't forget your duties.

196
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:05,086
Fine.

197
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:23,980
Satellites aren't working,
so I can't track your location.

198
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,484
When you press this,
it'll send signals to us.

199
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:30,529
-What if I don't?
-You will.

200
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:35,784
You're not the only one that kid
could save.

201
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:39,829
<i>He could save all of humanity</i>.

202
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:43,625
<i>Also,</i>

203
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:45,627
<i>if you do it,</i>

204
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,589
I'll tell you about your fiancé,
Nam Sang-won.

205
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:53,468
I know where he is and what he looks like.

206
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:36,219
It was a very dark night with no moon.

207
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:38,013
I lay down between the corpses

208
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:42,267
and pretended to be dead,

209
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:44,561
but I was watching them carefully.

210
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:51,276
The remnants of the People's Army
went inside the building,

211
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:55,697
and the Allied forces that were after them

212
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,700
fired hundreds of shots at the building.

213
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:09,753
Hey.

214
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,797
I know

215
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:18,470
I saw them go into the building
with my own two eyes.

216
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:21,181
But nobody came out of the building

217
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:23,266
and there were no dead bodies.

218
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:26,603
How baffling.

219
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:29,022
That building

220
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:34,944
was here.

221
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:39,282
Then…

222
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:44,371
We have no idea

223
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,874
what's buried underneath where we are.

224
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,584
That's what I mean.

225
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,461
-What?
-Jeez.

226
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:05,934
Who are you?

227
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:08,895
I think he's a runaway soldier.

228
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:19,322
Run…

229
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:21,282
Run…

230
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,451
Quickly.

231
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:30,458
Oh my…

232
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:49,436
Hey.

233
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:52,814
Don't you know you should always
be with your buddy?

234
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:57,068
I came here because my buddy is so sick.

235
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:03,992
Are you scared?

236
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:05,493
What?

237
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,913
You've grown a lot.

238
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:10,999
I was always this tall.

239
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,003
Right.

240
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:20,258
You're walking well.

241
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:24,179
What?

242
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:26,765
I thought your legs hurt.

243
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:32,437
That's why I quit ballet.

244
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:39,402
You were my last audience.
Consider it an honor.

245
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,406
You quit it for good?

246
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:46,201
Yes.

247
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:48,036
Why? You were so good.

248
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,207
Look what the world has become.

249
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:55,960
There's no one to watch me perform.

250
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,147
Who was it this time?

251
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:23,363
You have this look on your face
when someone gives you a hard time.

252
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:24,739
You know that, right?

253
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:26,533
No.

254
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:31,830
Well, you look like this

255
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,040
most of the time, though.

256
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,503
When someone fucks with you…

257
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:44,384
Do this at least, okay?

258
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:45,802
Now try it.

259
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:54,853
Hey, forget it. Gosh.

260
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:57,689
You have no talent.

261
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:01,276
All right. Look.

262
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:04,070
Fold this,

263
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:07,740
this, and this.

264
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:11,202
Just go like this.

265
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:13,496
What?

266
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,790
You just promised me.

267
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:17,458
Promised you what?

268
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:21,713
It's a secret.

269
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:24,007
Anyway, you made a promise.

270
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:28,177
Promise.

271
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:29,596
Congratulations.

272
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:31,848
It's your first love.

273
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:37,645
Oh my god, you're infuriating.

274
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:38,688
Hey, Hyun-su!

275
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:42,358
Look. Do it like this.

276
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:45,486
I taught you this just now.
Why don't you get it?

277
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,200
Jeez.

278
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:53,912
What are you staring at?

279
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:56,539
You're so annoying.

280
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:16,369
Did you really grab a knife?

281
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:22,166
At your first birthday ceremony?

282
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:24,335
You woke up, Ji-su.

283
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,466
To tell you the truth,
I grabbed something else.

284
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:31,884
Sorry?

285
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:35,638
They said I grabbed my dad by the collar.

286
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:39,434
It's so like you.

287
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:42,687
I really did grab a knife.

288
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,773
It was a rice cake knife.

289
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:50,153
You're a natural.

290
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:55,950
Teach me how to use a sword.

291
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:58,703
I will when you're all better.

292
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:07,336
Jae-heon, you're a good person.

293
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:11,632
I'm only trying to live by God's will.

294
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:15,553
Well, yes, anyway,

295
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:18,723
you saved my life.

296
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:21,976
That's also God's will.

297
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,311
Seriously? Hey.

298
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:29,650
Goodness.

299
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:33,654
I'm saying thank you.

300
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:36,449
Right.

301
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:39,410
Thank you, too,

302
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:41,704
for waking up.

303
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:48,586
First love?

304
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:53,841
That's crazy. That's just crazy.

305
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:57,386
First love, my ass.

306
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:01,474
Mister.

307
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:07,522
Got a lighter? Give me your lighter.

308
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:12,568
Are you bullying me or something?

309
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:14,529
No.

310
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:18,950
That's his way of saying thank you.

311
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:24,705
Then say please.

312
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:29,377
Please.

313
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:39,762
First love?

314
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:41,514
He's crazy.

315
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:46,936
Here. Take your lighter.

316
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:47,854
I quit smoking.

317
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:51,858
Let's see for how long.

318
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:53,734
TEMPERATURE LOG

319
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:59,198
Hey, four-eyes.

320
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:01,993
The soldier woke up,
and he's acting really weird.

321
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:03,661
Come quickly.

322
00:36:14,463 --> 00:36:17,216
Jang Ju-seong, tell me your affiliation
and your mission.

323
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,343
I shouldn't be here.

324
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:26,100
Pull yourself together.

325
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:30,229
<i>Is this working?</i>

326
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:33,774
-<i>The light is on.</i>
-<i>Is it working?</i>

327
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:37,320
<i>Hey, can you hear me?</i>

328
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,113
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

329
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:40,823
<i>Can't you hear me?</i>

330
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:42,491
<i>Damn it.</i>

331
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:45,786
<i>This bastard can hear us,</i>
<i>but he's ignoring us again.</i>

332
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:49,165
<i>Come out, come out, wherever you are.</i>

333
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:50,833
<i>Come out, come out.</i>

334
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:54,545
<i>-Damn it.</i>
-No.

335
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:55,796
<i>-Hey! Get him!</i>
-No.

336
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,173
-I have to run.
-<i>Bastard!</i>

337
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:59,425
Give me my gun.

338
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:01,510
Give it back. I really need my gun.

339
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:04,096
Please. Give me my gun, please.

340
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,232
Take down the SOS sign.
As soon as possible.

341
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:55,439
You can't move yet.

342
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:01,404
Did you pass gas?

343
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:05,574
I don't know.

344
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:08,327
She did.

345
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:10,496
It was quiet and weak,

346
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:12,206
-but it smelled…
-No.

347
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,043
like nothing.

348
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:17,962
Son of a…

349
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:19,380
That's good.

350
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:21,590
Then you can eat now.

351
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:23,634
Start with a little bit of porridge.

352
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:28,681
These are antibiotics people gave me.

353
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:34,395
Thank you so much for doing this for me.

354
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:37,815
Eun-yu said you had surgical experience,
so I could trust you.

355
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:41,193
Did she say that?

356
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:45,489
I've never even observed surgery.

357
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:54,415
Still, you did a great job.

358
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:56,334
Well…

359
00:38:58,044 --> 00:38:59,545
Bring Eun-yu here, please.

360
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,512
Why are you here?

361
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:12,683
You should look at and listen to
only good things for the baby.

362
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:19,148
That's why I'm here.

363
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:32,578
I'll do my best.

364
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:37,792
I really want to meet your baby…

365
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:41,879
and see it smile.

366
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:50,971
Fifteen days.

367
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:56,685
If you can endure 15 days
after the first symptom,

368
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:58,562
you'll be over the worst.

369
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:24,588
Is he the security guard?

370
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:41,063
Wasn't it just the two that went up?

371
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:05,838
Go first.

372
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:47,338
Don't go.

373
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:48,797
It's too dangerous.

374
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:50,799
Don't go.

375
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:25,626
Sir?

376
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:34,051
Rotten fish!

377
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:28,911
No…

378
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:39,505
Throw it!

379
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:50,224
Throw it!

380
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:06,907
Throw it.

381
00:47:39,147 --> 00:47:40,899
Throw it!

382
00:48:43,837 --> 00:48:45,672
