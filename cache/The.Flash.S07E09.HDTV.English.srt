1
00:00:02,191 --> 00:00:04,236
She's dead.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,977
You killed Alexa.

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:07,805
Nora:
Barry and I did it together.

4
00:00:07,848 --> 00:00:09,111
That was the only way.

5
00:00:09,154 --> 00:00:11,330
She was the strongest.

6
00:00:11,374 --> 00:00:13,115
I needed every ounce of power,

7
00:00:13,158 --> 00:00:14,638
including your strength,
to kill her.

8
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:17,510
I'm supposed to protect
lives, not destroy them!

9
00:00:17,554 --> 00:00:19,382
I'm helping you clean up
your mess, Barry.

10
00:00:19,425 --> 00:00:21,123
This is your fault.

11
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:24,474
The night you brought me back,
you created these monsters.

12
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:27,172
You and your lightning rod.

13
00:00:29,914 --> 00:00:31,481
When you regained your speed,

14
00:00:31,524 --> 00:00:34,440
I wasn't the only thing
you two willed into existence.

15
00:00:34,484 --> 00:00:37,400
- That's impossible.
- Really?

16
00:00:38,488 --> 00:00:42,144
Alexa was afraid to come here,
but she trusted you.

17
00:00:43,754 --> 00:00:44,972
Why?

18
00:00:46,539 --> 00:00:49,412
Because deep down, she could
feel a connection with you.

19
00:00:49,455 --> 00:00:52,154
The same connection
that you feel with me now.

20
00:00:52,197 --> 00:00:54,112
But, these new forces?

21
00:00:54,156 --> 00:00:56,767
The way they've merged with the
people they chose as avatars?

22
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:59,900
It's corrupted them
because it's unnatural.

23
00:01:01,293 --> 00:01:03,165
But once the other two
are gone--

24
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:05,123
I won't help you kill again.

25
00:01:05,167 --> 00:01:06,777
Oh...

26
00:01:08,257 --> 00:01:10,476
My beautiful boy.

27
00:01:11,956 --> 00:01:14,437
You have no choice.

28
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,003
Because if you don't,

29
00:01:16,047 --> 00:01:20,225
those things will kill everyone
you've sworn to keep safe.

30
00:01:20,269 --> 00:01:22,184
Is that what you want?

31
00:01:24,403 --> 00:01:27,885
Then, please, Barry...

32
00:01:27,928 --> 00:01:29,408
help me.

33
00:01:33,282 --> 00:01:34,674
No.

34
00:01:34,718 --> 00:01:37,155
You have to help me,
damn it!

35
00:01:37,199 --> 00:01:39,288
Nora, stop.

36
00:01:42,726 --> 00:01:45,337
I will destroy
those other forces, Barry,

37
00:01:45,381 --> 00:01:48,558
with or without your help.

38
00:01:48,601 --> 00:01:50,864
Then you'll see that I'm right.

39
00:02:18,283 --> 00:02:19,893
What a day.

40
00:02:19,937 --> 00:02:22,592
First, Frost is sent to
Iron Heights for life,

41
00:02:22,635 --> 00:02:25,029
and now Alexa's dead.

42
00:02:25,072 --> 00:02:27,031
I can't let this happen
again.

43
00:02:27,074 --> 00:02:28,946
I'll get to work.
I need to figure out

44
00:02:28,989 --> 00:02:31,209
how Nora was able to...

45
00:02:31,253 --> 00:02:32,689
Kill a god?

46
00:02:32,732 --> 00:02:34,256
She could
because she had help.

47
00:02:34,299 --> 00:02:36,083
Barry, she tricked you.

48
00:02:36,127 --> 00:02:37,346
No, she manipulated me,

49
00:02:37,389 --> 00:02:38,825
just like she's been doing
the whole time.

50
00:02:38,869 --> 00:02:42,002
Honey, I know how you feel,but...

51
00:02:42,046 --> 00:02:43,917
not everything she did
and said was a lie.

52
00:02:43,961 --> 00:02:45,745
I mean, there were moments
that felt real too.

53
00:02:45,789 --> 00:02:46,746
That must mean--

54
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:49,271
Iris, we can't trust her
anymore.

55
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,927
What about
what Nora said

56
00:02:53,971 --> 00:02:56,843
about you two
creating the other forces?

57
00:02:57,366 --> 00:02:59,019
I mean,
there's no proof.

58
00:02:59,063 --> 00:03:02,501
Well, what if we find out
if Nora's telling the truth?

59
00:03:02,545 --> 00:03:04,590
If she is, then that means
the other forces

60
00:03:04,634 --> 00:03:06,505
would have been born
the same day she was.

61
00:03:06,549 --> 00:03:07,854
I'll pull satellite scans

62
00:03:07,898 --> 00:03:09,247
from the night we fought
Mirror Monarch.

63
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:11,728
Please, and thank you.

64
00:03:14,818 --> 00:03:17,821
Okay, you see that cluster of
kinetic energy readings?

65
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:20,302
Pretty sure
that's the Speed Force

66
00:03:20,345 --> 00:03:22,608
being reborn in the Speed Lab.

67
00:03:22,652 --> 00:03:25,350
Whoa. There they are.

68
00:03:25,394 --> 00:03:28,701
Three brand-spanking-new
isotopic signatures.

69
00:03:30,486 --> 00:03:33,227
Nora was right.

70
00:03:33,271 --> 00:03:36,796
We created the forces.

71
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,366
Fuerza's dead.

72
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:43,150
Nora killed her.

73
00:03:43,194 --> 00:03:45,239
She killed
the Strength Force?

74
00:03:45,283 --> 00:03:48,765
And now she wants to kill
the other two forces.

75
00:03:48,808 --> 00:03:52,159
Maybe I should go to
San Francisco.

76
00:03:52,203 --> 00:03:53,857
What?

77
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,207
My series of photos
on Eva's attacks

78
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,948
got accepted
at a gallery there.

79
00:03:57,991 --> 00:03:59,253
Babe, congrats!

80
00:03:59,297 --> 00:04:01,299
Well,
I was thinking of going

81
00:04:01,343 --> 00:04:03,083
to help them install
the exhibition.

82
00:04:03,127 --> 00:04:06,652
I'd ask you to come, but I know
you have your perfect job

83
00:04:06,696 --> 00:04:09,002
at S.T.A.R. Labs
and your amazing friends.

84
00:04:09,046 --> 00:04:11,831
I mean...you're an OG member
of Team Flash.

85
00:04:15,052 --> 00:04:17,141
You okay?

86
00:04:17,184 --> 00:04:18,360
Yeah...

87
00:04:18,403 --> 00:04:20,710
Yeah, I'm fine.

88
00:04:20,753 --> 00:04:24,017
This is an isotopic
scanning lens.

89
00:04:24,061 --> 00:04:26,759
It can detect the signatures
of all four forces,

90
00:04:26,803 --> 00:04:29,632
even kinetic signatures
from Speed Force Nora.

91
00:04:29,675 --> 00:04:31,155
And if one's nearby--

92
00:04:31,198 --> 00:04:33,810
It lights up like
an overexposed landscape.

93
00:04:33,853 --> 00:04:36,552
In which case,
you run the other way.

94
00:04:36,595 --> 00:04:39,598
Okay? I'm serious.

95
00:04:40,425 --> 00:04:42,775
I just want you to be safe.

96
00:04:44,603 --> 00:04:46,736
Are you sure you're okay?

97
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,132
Ohh, it's Barry.

98
00:04:52,176 --> 00:04:54,570
I gotta get back--they could
have found Nora...

99
00:04:54,613 --> 00:04:56,746
or worse, she's come back
on her own.

100
00:05:00,227 --> 00:05:01,403
How bad is it?

101
00:05:01,446 --> 00:05:03,187
Okay--did Nora
kill somebody else?

102
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:05,407
No, and I have a way to make
sure she never does.

103
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:07,321
Okay, how?

104
00:05:07,365 --> 00:05:08,888
I'm here.

105
00:05:08,932 --> 00:05:10,673
What's going on?

106
00:05:10,716 --> 00:05:12,631
I spent all night

107
00:05:12,675 --> 00:05:14,546
coming up with a way
to fix all this.

108
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:17,114
Okay, what's the solve?

109
00:05:17,157 --> 00:05:20,422
We need to wipe the new
forces out of existence.

110
00:05:20,465 --> 00:05:21,901
Barry, what are you saying?

111
00:05:21,945 --> 00:05:25,514
I want to go back in time...
and uncreate them.

112
00:05:32,016 --> 00:05:35,364
Barry, you're talking about
creating another Flashpoint.

113
00:05:35,408 --> 00:05:36,801
You know we can't do that.

114
00:05:36,844 --> 00:05:38,454
Not if I can figure out
a way to go back

115
00:05:38,498 --> 00:05:40,108
that doesn't affect
the timeline.

116
00:05:40,152 --> 00:05:42,023
- Which would be impossible.
- Barry, look.

117
00:05:42,067 --> 00:05:44,722
I know that you're devastated
about Alexa.

118
00:05:44,765 --> 00:05:47,638
But uncreating forces?

119
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,074
That crosses a line.

120
00:05:49,117 --> 00:05:51,337
I convinced Alexa
to come here.

121
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,295
Her death is my fault.

122
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:55,776
If we don't get these new
forces out of Psych and Deon,

123
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,474
Nora will kill them, too,
so it's on us to fix this.

124
00:05:58,518 --> 00:06:00,999
- By killing Deon and Psych?
- No, I'm not killing them.

125
00:06:01,042 --> 00:06:03,567
I'm saving them from the forces
that took over their lives.

126
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:04,959
Whoever they were before this,
they can

127
00:06:05,003 --> 00:06:06,657
go back to being those
same people again.

128
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,355
And what about the other
force that was born that night?

129
00:06:09,398 --> 00:06:11,749
Nora. If you uncreate her--
- We're only gonna target

130
00:06:11,792 --> 00:06:14,055
the new forces, not Nora.
That's the plan.

131
00:06:14,099 --> 00:06:15,840
But if something
goes wrong,

132
00:06:15,883 --> 00:06:17,842
Barry, you might
lose your speed.

133
00:06:17,885 --> 00:06:20,105
Then I lose my speed.
All right?

134
00:06:20,148 --> 00:06:22,847
It's--it's worth the risk
to keep everyone safe.

135
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,805
And what about the risk
to Nora?

136
00:06:24,849 --> 00:06:26,720
Does her life not matter
at all any--

137
00:06:26,764 --> 00:06:30,332
Nora's not a person, Iris.

138
00:06:30,376 --> 00:06:32,900
She never was.

139
00:06:32,944 --> 00:06:35,990
Look, if we uncreate
these forces,

140
00:06:36,034 --> 00:06:38,689
we can put everything
back to normal.

141
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,560
Hopefully that'll fix her too.

142
00:06:40,604 --> 00:06:42,910
Hopefully?

143
00:06:42,954 --> 00:06:45,086
Barry, do you hear yourself
right now?

144
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:48,437
Iris, I'm trying
to save people.

145
00:06:48,481 --> 00:06:51,919
How--how do you not see
this is the right thing to do?

146
00:06:51,963 --> 00:06:53,747
The right thing to do

147
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:55,923
would be trying to
get through to Nora.

148
00:06:55,967 --> 00:06:57,403
Just like how we beat Eva,

149
00:06:57,446 --> 00:06:59,100
just like how we talked down
Abra Kadabra.

150
00:06:59,144 --> 00:07:02,103
That is what we do.
- We tried talking to her.

151
00:07:02,147 --> 00:07:04,236
All Nora did was double down.

152
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:06,978
There's no reaching her.

153
00:07:07,021 --> 00:07:09,110
Obviously we disagree on this.

154
00:07:09,154 --> 00:07:12,157
Yes, we do.

155
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,637
I have to do it.

156
00:07:17,945 --> 00:07:22,123
Then you'll be doing it
without me.

157
00:07:28,521 --> 00:07:31,959
Wait...you want to go
after a force of nature?

158
00:07:32,003 --> 00:07:34,832
Yeah, if I can convince Nora
not to kill Deon and Psych,

159
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:37,965
then...Barry will see that
she can be reasoned with.

160
00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:39,358
But, how do we find her?

161
00:07:39,401 --> 00:07:41,447
I mean, she's the freakin'
Speed Force.

162
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:42,709
Well, if she finds us first,

163
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:46,147
at least we'll know
she's coming.

164
00:07:46,191 --> 00:07:49,020
Holy crap...you guys gotta
see this.

165
00:07:51,239 --> 00:07:53,502
You see that bright spot
at the center of you?

166
00:07:53,546 --> 00:07:56,201
I think that's kinetic energy.

167
00:07:56,244 --> 00:07:58,377
Guys, this is gonna sound
really wild, but...

168
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:01,467
Yeah, 'cause a ghost-hunting
lens isn't weird enough...

169
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:04,035
But, if Barry and I created
these forces,

170
00:08:04,078 --> 00:08:06,820
what if there's a little bit of
each of them inside of us?

171
00:08:06,864 --> 00:08:09,910
Like you're all connected?

172
00:08:09,954 --> 00:08:11,912
Wait, Iris...
when you're over by the door,

173
00:08:11,956 --> 00:08:13,392
your glow was brighter.

174
00:08:13,435 --> 00:08:15,002
Like there's something
in that direction

175
00:08:15,046 --> 00:08:16,787
that was intensifying it.

176
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,441
- What if...
- That something is Nora?

177
00:08:20,181 --> 00:08:24,664
Guys, we can use me as a
divining rod to track her down.

178
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:27,928
Yup, that's weirder.

179
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:31,715
Elemental Force Particles?

180
00:08:31,758 --> 00:08:33,978
They're the particles
that created the new forces.

181
00:08:34,021 --> 00:08:35,893
The lightning bolt
that rebirthed the Speed Force

182
00:08:35,936 --> 00:08:37,938
was full of them.
- Now if we can extract

183
00:08:37,982 --> 00:08:39,548
a sample
of these force particles

184
00:08:39,592 --> 00:08:40,854
from the lightning,

185
00:08:40,898 --> 00:08:42,943
then we can send out
an electromagnetic pulse

186
00:08:42,987 --> 00:08:44,858
that'll seek out those
same particles,

187
00:08:44,902 --> 00:08:46,512
wherever they may be
along the temporal spectrum.

188
00:08:46,555 --> 00:08:50,298
And you can erase the new
forces from existence.

189
00:08:50,342 --> 00:08:52,257
That's not bad.

190
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,824
Small detail, though.

191
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,043
How in the world
are you supposed to

192
00:08:56,087 --> 00:09:00,134
extract these particles
from a giant bolt of lightning?

193
00:09:00,178 --> 00:09:02,920
A few weeks ago when
Barry was Spock-Flash,

194
00:09:02,963 --> 00:09:05,313
he modified the Tachyon
Enhancer to siphon

195
00:09:05,357 --> 00:09:07,315
Mirror Monarch's
dark matter photons.

196
00:09:07,359 --> 00:09:09,404
So all we have to do
is tweak the Enhancer

197
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:12,364
to siphon Force Particles
instead of photons.

198
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,454
Tweaking the
Tachyon Enhancer...

199
00:09:15,497 --> 00:09:18,631
and then send out an EMP
to eighty-six the forces.

200
00:09:18,674 --> 00:09:21,765
That's genius. I mean
it's foolproof, even.

201
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:27,771
But it still doesn't answer how
we're supposed to do this

202
00:09:27,814 --> 00:09:30,817
and protect the timeline.

203
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:33,341
I'll figure out.
Somehow, I will.

204
00:09:33,385 --> 00:09:34,908
I'll figure it out.

205
00:09:34,952 --> 00:09:37,911
Man, I wish Nash Wells
was here.

206
00:09:37,955 --> 00:09:39,957
I mean, he came up with
most of these equations

207
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,306
for the A.S.F. Machine.

208
00:09:41,349 --> 00:09:44,657
I feel like
he'd crack this easy peasy.

209
00:09:45,571 --> 00:09:47,225
Modify the Particle Harness
Collector.

210
00:09:47,268 --> 00:09:48,922
I'll be back as soon as I can.

211
00:09:48,966 --> 00:09:52,186
Roger that,
but where are you going?

212
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:55,146
To get the one person that
can help us pull this off.

213
00:10:01,152 --> 00:10:04,285
Oh, no...Tess.

214
00:10:04,329 --> 00:10:06,505
President Bartlett
just mixed up his meds.

215
00:10:06,548 --> 00:10:09,682
That's not gonna be good,
but...great TV.

216
00:10:09,725 --> 00:10:11,815
Whoa!

217
00:10:14,818 --> 00:10:17,864
Allen. Allen.

218
00:10:19,823 --> 00:10:21,781
I'm guessing
this isn't a social call?

219
00:10:21,825 --> 00:10:24,871
Not exactly.
We need your help.

220
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:26,612
How bad is it?

221
00:10:26,655 --> 00:10:28,527
- That depends.
- On...

222
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:31,878
Whether or not you can help
us do the impossible.

223
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:50,157
Well, well, well.
Honey, I'm home.

224
00:10:50,201 --> 00:10:53,987
Holy deus ex machina...
Timeless Wells.

225
00:10:56,207 --> 00:10:58,165
- Perfect timing.
- Always.

226
00:10:58,209 --> 00:11:00,646
So, apparently, there's danger
in Central City.

227
00:11:00,689 --> 00:11:02,996
- Apparently.
- Well, let's get busy.

228
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,432
Well, you really think

229
00:11:04,476 --> 00:11:07,044
we can do this without
affecting the timeline?

230
00:11:07,087 --> 00:11:08,697
I know we can.

231
00:11:08,741 --> 00:11:10,743
As long as we use me
as your guide.

232
00:11:10,786 --> 00:11:12,527
Harrison was there when
the forces were created.

233
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:14,529
So if we used the other "him"
from that night

234
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:15,966
as a beacon to lock onto--

235
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:19,056
Hopefully I can go back
to that exact moment,

236
00:11:19,099 --> 00:11:20,927
also bring Allen along
for the ride,

237
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:22,886
and he'll collect
the particles.

238
00:11:22,929 --> 00:11:26,367
Oof, wait, so you can travel
through time with a plus one?

239
00:11:26,411 --> 00:11:28,369
It should work...

240
00:11:28,413 --> 00:11:30,850
When Allen and I go back
to that exact moment

241
00:11:30,894 --> 00:11:33,809
that those dangerous forces
were created 17 days ago,

242
00:11:33,853 --> 00:11:37,770
I will--I will create
a protective-time bubble

243
00:11:37,813 --> 00:11:40,512
from that moment until now,

244
00:11:40,555 --> 00:11:42,906
preserving those days
in this timeline,

245
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:47,562
and preventing
anything from changing.

246
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:51,958
Which would also allow us
to wipe out the new forces

247
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:54,830
without altering
any of the events

248
00:11:54,874 --> 00:11:56,049
that have happened
since then--

249
00:11:56,093 --> 00:11:59,400
Yo! That is--that is trippy.

250
00:11:59,444 --> 00:12:01,141
Cisco, this will work.

251
00:12:01,185 --> 00:12:02,751
What about Iris?

252
00:12:02,795 --> 00:12:05,493
When she sees everyone safe,
she'll come around.

253
00:12:05,537 --> 00:12:06,842
She has to.

254
00:12:06,886 --> 00:12:09,889
You're not convinced.
I wasn't either,

255
00:12:09,933 --> 00:12:12,631
when Allen told me about this,
I thought of Tess.

256
00:12:13,893 --> 00:12:17,375
I thought of my wife, and how
my future with Tess was...

257
00:12:17,418 --> 00:12:19,333
ripped from me.

258
00:12:19,377 --> 00:12:21,031
Until this gift...

259
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:26,427
which has allowed me to relive
every single day with Tess,

260
00:12:26,471 --> 00:12:29,256
but only...

261
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,649
because I took a chance.

262
00:12:40,615 --> 00:12:42,356
All right.

263
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,489
I'm in.

264
00:12:49,842 --> 00:12:52,105
It's brighter.
We must be getting close.

265
00:12:55,848 --> 00:12:57,981
She should be here.

266
00:12:58,024 --> 00:13:00,853
Maybe it was
a false positive.

267
00:13:02,289 --> 00:13:04,117
Maybe since Nora
is the Speed Force,

268
00:13:04,161 --> 00:13:06,685
her isotopic signature
is all over the city by now.

269
00:13:06,728 --> 00:13:08,730
- So what do we do?
- I don't know.

270
00:13:08,774 --> 00:13:10,819
But we are running
out of time.

271
00:13:10,863 --> 00:13:12,865
Well, Cisco always says
you can't solve a problem

272
00:13:12,908 --> 00:13:14,432
till you're asking
the right question.

273
00:13:14,475 --> 00:13:17,174
Isn't "Where's Nora's
kinetic energy leading us"

274
00:13:17,217 --> 00:13:19,611
the right question?

275
00:13:19,654 --> 00:13:21,047
No.

276
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:23,832
The right question is
"Where's Nora?"

277
00:13:23,876 --> 00:13:25,704
We've been trying to find
the Speed Force

278
00:13:25,747 --> 00:13:28,794
when we should be looking
for... the person.

279
00:13:28,837 --> 00:13:32,624
So where would the real
Nora Allen go?

280
00:13:32,667 --> 00:13:34,582
Home.

281
00:13:34,626 --> 00:13:36,106
Come on.

282
00:13:39,979 --> 00:13:42,721
Harness modifications
complete.

283
00:13:42,764 --> 00:13:45,202
Let's get some time particles.

284
00:13:46,812 --> 00:13:48,770
Actually, you know what?
Um...

285
00:13:48,814 --> 00:13:51,208
Let me run just one more
diagnostic

286
00:13:51,251 --> 00:13:53,079
on the collection disc.

287
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:56,952
I just need
one more, just one more...

288
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:07,224
Oh, frak.

289
00:14:07,267 --> 00:14:09,530
Yo, yo, Deon.

290
00:14:09,574 --> 00:14:10,966
What's--what's uh...

291
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:14,057
What's good, man?
- You tell me.

292
00:14:15,406 --> 00:14:17,930
Something drew me here.

293
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,367
Was it you?

294
00:14:20,411 --> 00:14:21,847
I'm--I don't think
it was...

295
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:25,372
Who's this?
I'm sorry, who are you?

296
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:27,026
Who am I? Who are you?

297
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,506
Who is he?

298
00:14:28,549 --> 00:14:30,769
Look, guys, all's good
in the hood.

299
00:14:30,812 --> 00:14:32,336
All right, look.

300
00:14:32,379 --> 00:14:34,729
Barry, this is Deon.

301
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:37,645
Still Force.

302
00:14:37,689 --> 00:14:39,386
And--and Deon,
this is Barry,

303
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:41,562
who's actually--

304
00:14:41,606 --> 00:14:46,611
owner of this, uh,
fine establishment.

305
00:14:47,438 --> 00:14:49,744
- So you're the landlord.

306
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:52,486
What's that got to do
with anything?

307
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:54,575
Deon...

308
00:14:54,619 --> 00:14:56,403
it's good to meet you.

309
00:14:56,447 --> 00:14:57,970
Actually, you remember me?

310
00:14:58,013 --> 00:14:59,798
I was with him, you called us
one of the Urkels.

311
00:14:59,841 --> 00:15:01,756
Oh, yeah...the cornballs.

312
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,716
Cornball. He's so funny.

313
00:15:05,673 --> 00:15:07,110
Who's the egghead?

314
00:15:08,676 --> 00:15:10,591
Harrison Wells.

315
00:15:10,635 --> 00:15:12,332
I'm a fellow--

316
00:15:13,899 --> 00:15:17,120
Uh, visitor to Barry's place.

317
00:15:18,338 --> 00:15:22,081
You know, y'all are being
real friendly right now.

318
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:24,779
But I think--

319
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:26,433
I think y'all are acting
like that

320
00:15:26,477 --> 00:15:28,827
because you're afraid of me.

321
00:15:30,611 --> 00:15:32,178
Now why is that?
- No, we're just...

322
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:34,659
we're just making a--we're just
doing an experiment--

323
00:15:34,702 --> 00:15:36,356
Shut up!

324
00:15:52,459 --> 00:15:54,461
Now...

325
00:15:54,505 --> 00:15:59,162
why do I get the feeling...

326
00:15:59,205 --> 00:16:01,773
you're reason I'm this way?

327
00:16:04,341 --> 00:16:07,474
Because that's true.

328
00:16:07,518 --> 00:16:09,563
And I'm sorry.

329
00:16:09,607 --> 00:16:12,175
I never meant
for this to happen.

330
00:16:12,218 --> 00:16:15,439
So please let me fix it.
- Fix it?

331
00:16:15,482 --> 00:16:17,876
Fix it?
So I'm a mistake?

332
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:21,227
- I didn't say that--
- You didn't have to.

333
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:25,710
I can feel it.

334
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:33,674
You want to destroy me.
- No, I want to save you.

335
00:16:33,718 --> 00:16:36,068
Deon....Deon.

336
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:40,638
There are three other forces--
people like you.

337
00:16:40,681 --> 00:16:45,338
One of them?
She wants to kill you.

338
00:16:45,382 --> 00:16:48,211
Now, she's already killed
one of the other forces--

339
00:16:48,254 --> 00:16:50,778
the Strength Force,
and she didn't care

340
00:16:50,822 --> 00:16:55,566
when the person containing
that force died too.

341
00:16:55,609 --> 00:17:00,875
So I need to make it so the
Still Force never found you.

342
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:03,487
It's the only way
to keep you safe.

343
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:10,189
Nah.

344
00:17:10,233 --> 00:17:12,235
I like being me.

345
00:17:19,894 --> 00:17:21,505
Oh, I get it.

346
00:17:23,246 --> 00:17:25,509
Oh, I get it.
- Yeah?

347
00:17:25,552 --> 00:17:27,032
No, I get it. I get it.

348
00:17:27,075 --> 00:17:28,860
This is what you're gonna
use to do it, huh?

349
00:17:28,903 --> 00:17:30,078
This is what you're gonna use

350
00:17:30,122 --> 00:17:31,254
to make it like I neverexisted?

351
00:17:31,297 --> 00:17:33,560
Not you,
just the force inside--

352
00:17:33,604 --> 00:17:36,128
Man, I am that force!

353
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:39,262
Do you have any idea
what it's like

354
00:17:39,305 --> 00:17:41,829
to be told that you
shouldn't be here?

355
00:17:45,137 --> 00:17:49,097
I never asked to be born.

356
00:17:49,141 --> 00:17:50,708
Deon, listen to me.

357
00:17:50,751 --> 00:17:53,058
Look at what you're doing.

358
00:17:53,101 --> 00:17:55,539
Okay, you--you don't understand
what you are.

359
00:17:55,582 --> 00:17:59,325
Yeah, I do.

360
00:18:00,935 --> 00:18:04,069
I'm a god.

361
00:18:04,112 --> 00:18:06,593
Maybe it's time
you understood that.

362
00:18:06,637 --> 00:18:07,899
Deon, wait--

363
00:18:13,513 --> 00:18:15,472
Time to bounce.

364
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:18,170
...right?

365
00:18:22,174 --> 00:18:24,394
What the hell
just happened?

366
00:18:29,312 --> 00:18:31,923
I think your friend Deon
just stopped time.

367
00:18:31,966 --> 00:18:33,794
Yeah, he does that.

368
00:18:33,838 --> 00:18:36,231
Why'd he leave?

369
00:18:36,275 --> 00:18:38,582
Because I couldn't stop him.

370
00:18:42,593 --> 00:18:44,951
Deon just aged the harness
a thousand years.

371
00:18:44,994 --> 00:18:48,650
- How bad is it?
- Pretty bad.

372
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:51,087
But not hopeless.

373
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:54,351
See I figured if we can find
some way to--

374
00:18:54,395 --> 00:18:57,050
somehow create some sort of...

375
00:18:59,966 --> 00:19:02,490
I was working on the collection
disc when Deon showed up.

376
00:19:02,534 --> 00:19:04,623
I figured I better hide it
just in case.

377
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:06,668
Chester.

378
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:07,756
You're a lifesaver.

379
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,324
As for the vest,

380
00:19:10,367 --> 00:19:12,282
I'm used to working with junk.

381
00:19:12,326 --> 00:19:14,371
I'll just need a bunch of
replacement parts

382
00:19:14,415 --> 00:19:16,591
from my garage and she'll be up
and running in no time.

383
00:19:16,635 --> 00:19:20,377
With a little help, that is.
- I'm with you.

384
00:19:27,036 --> 00:19:28,647
What's up?

385
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,477
I think Deon's right.

386
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,174
We can't just...

387
00:19:34,217 --> 00:19:37,525
uncreate these forces
like that.

388
00:19:38,352 --> 00:19:40,223
Uh--so what, we--we...

389
00:19:40,267 --> 00:19:43,009
we should just give up?

390
00:19:43,052 --> 00:19:44,793
On this? Yeah, we give up.

391
00:19:44,837 --> 00:19:47,666
Doesn't that feel like
the right thing to do?

392
00:19:50,973 --> 00:19:53,280
Cisco, Nora will kill him

393
00:19:53,323 --> 00:19:55,717
if I don't do something
to prevent it.

394
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,632
Just like she killed Alexa.

395
00:19:57,676 --> 00:20:00,113
'Cause she's not gonna stop
until all the forces--

396
00:20:00,156 --> 00:20:03,464
and the people connected
to them--are dead.

397
00:20:03,508 --> 00:20:05,510
Why can't you see?
I'm trying to save him.

398
00:20:05,553 --> 00:20:08,164
He doesn't want to be
saved by you!

399
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:11,516
He just wants to be given
the chance to be himself.

400
00:20:13,822 --> 00:20:15,650
And Iris understood that.

401
00:20:15,694 --> 00:20:19,349
Look, every second that we
leave these forces

402
00:20:19,393 --> 00:20:21,917
inside Deon and Psych,
people are in danger.

403
00:20:21,961 --> 00:20:24,180
It's only a matter of time
before someone dies

404
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:25,747
in one of Psych's nightmares

405
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:28,576
or gets killed by some kind
of Deon time anomaly.

406
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:31,361
Not to mention Nora
declared war.

407
00:20:31,405 --> 00:20:33,363
She doesn't care how many
people she kills

408
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:35,104
as long as the forces die.

409
00:20:35,148 --> 00:20:37,672
You're right.
Yes, you're absolutely right.

410
00:20:37,716 --> 00:20:39,848
And something needs to be done
about that.

411
00:20:39,892 --> 00:20:42,242
And I don't have
all the answers.

412
00:20:42,285 --> 00:20:45,201
All I know is...

413
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:48,204
this can't be it.

414
00:20:52,992 --> 00:20:55,211
You guys understand, right?

415
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:58,563
I--I have to uncreate
these forces.

416
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:04,090
Like I said, I am--I'm
Team Flash all the way.

417
00:21:05,744 --> 00:21:07,441
But...

418
00:21:07,484 --> 00:21:10,313
Cisco has a point, man.

419
00:21:13,969 --> 00:21:15,188
Harrison?

420
00:21:15,231 --> 00:21:17,407
If uncreating these forces is

421
00:21:17,451 --> 00:21:19,061
what you feel in your heart
is right,

422
00:21:19,105 --> 00:21:21,237
I'll take that voyage with you.

423
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:26,155
But all I ask is that you
think--truly think

424
00:21:26,199 --> 00:21:28,854
about the choice you're making.

425
00:21:37,514 --> 00:21:39,778
Please fix the harness.

426
00:21:43,825 --> 00:21:46,828
Good luck.

427
00:21:56,229 --> 00:21:57,622
Iris, you were right.

428
00:21:57,665 --> 00:22:00,712
These isotopic readings
are off the chart.

429
00:22:00,755 --> 00:22:02,844
Where are we?

430
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:04,367
The old Allen house.

431
00:22:04,411 --> 00:22:08,197
This is where Barry's mom
was killed.

432
00:22:08,241 --> 00:22:11,636
He also said this is where the
Speed Force went when she died.

433
00:22:13,855 --> 00:22:17,293
Whoa.
That old car is hella vintage.

434
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:19,469
Almost looks brand new.

435
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:22,647
Must be a collector
or something.

436
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:24,692
We can ask him
when we're done.

437
00:22:24,736 --> 00:22:26,694
Assuming we survive.

438
00:22:32,744 --> 00:22:35,834
Caitlin called me
about Alexa.

439
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:38,750
So it turns out,

440
00:22:38,793 --> 00:22:42,275
when Iris and I brought back
the Speed Force,

441
00:22:42,318 --> 00:22:46,583
we also created
three new forces.

442
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:51,719
It's our fault that they're out
in the world hurting people.

443
00:22:51,763 --> 00:22:53,721
Killing them.

444
00:22:53,765 --> 00:22:55,680
So I feel like...

445
00:22:55,723 --> 00:22:58,900
I have to be the one
to take them out.

446
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:01,294
These forces.

447
00:23:01,337 --> 00:23:04,993
You think
they're above saving, too?

448
00:23:05,037 --> 00:23:10,346
I think it would be safer for
everybody if they didn't exist.

449
00:23:11,173 --> 00:23:13,959
You remember when Wally
first showed up?

450
00:23:14,002 --> 00:23:17,092
Man, it wasn't just that
I'd found out I have a son.

451
00:23:17,136 --> 00:23:18,703
I found out

452
00:23:18,746 --> 00:23:23,403
I have a son who kept getting
his butt in trouble.

453
00:23:23,446 --> 00:23:26,754
Boy, he was mad at the world.

454
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:28,713
There was one point

455
00:23:28,756 --> 00:23:32,629
he said to me that he wished
he had never been born.

456
00:23:33,326 --> 00:23:38,374
So I tried to get close.

457
00:23:38,418 --> 00:23:40,420
And he pushed me away.

458
00:23:40,463 --> 00:23:43,031
I tried to give him space,

459
00:23:43,075 --> 00:23:45,207
then he felt abandoned.

460
00:23:45,251 --> 00:23:47,209
No parent is perfect.

461
00:23:47,253 --> 00:23:50,996
But one thing I never
stopped doing

462
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:52,867
was trying.

463
00:23:52,911 --> 00:23:55,304
And look at the man
he grew up to be.

464
00:23:55,348 --> 00:23:59,831
Strong. Kind. Good.

465
00:23:59,874 --> 00:24:03,399
Yeah I get it, I--I do,but...

466
00:24:03,443 --> 00:24:05,401
I mean, these forces?

467
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:08,056
They're not my children.
- You sure?

468
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,755
You said it yourself.

469
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:13,540
You brought them
into this world.

470
00:24:13,583 --> 00:24:18,240
Look, I know they've all done
terrible things.

471
00:24:18,284 --> 00:24:20,852
But what if they could change?

472
00:24:20,895 --> 00:24:27,423
You never judge your kids
for who they are now.

473
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:29,904
You help them become...

474
00:24:29,948 --> 00:24:35,605
who they know they can be
when they grow up.

475
00:24:35,649 --> 00:24:38,913
So lead with love.

476
00:24:39,392 --> 00:24:44,310
After that, it is up to them.

477
00:25:02,502 --> 00:25:04,460
This is Barry's old room.

478
00:25:25,873 --> 00:25:27,353
Nora?

479
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,669
Psych.

480
00:25:44,849 --> 00:25:46,024
Hi, Mom.

481
00:25:56,948 --> 00:25:58,993
Esperanza, don't kill me!

482
00:25:59,037 --> 00:26:00,995
They're everywhere.
We need to keep them out.

483
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,389
Psych, stop. You're hurting
them--please.

484
00:26:03,432 --> 00:26:05,304
Oh, they're hurting
themselves.

485
00:26:05,347 --> 00:26:06,871
Sure, I pull back the curtain.

486
00:26:06,914 --> 00:26:08,568
But what they see
is up to them.

487
00:26:08,611 --> 00:26:11,005
Now, before I show you
your worst fear,

488
00:26:11,049 --> 00:26:12,528
why were you looking for me?

489
00:26:12,572 --> 00:26:13,790
I wasn't.

490
00:26:13,834 --> 00:26:15,053
No...

491
00:26:15,096 --> 00:26:18,360
You're looking for
the Speed Force?

492
00:26:18,404 --> 00:26:20,188
Nora. Why?

493
00:26:20,232 --> 00:26:21,668
Why are you so desperate
to find her?

494
00:26:21,711 --> 00:26:23,061
Is it to hurt her?

495
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:24,889
I want to talk to her
so I can help her.

496
00:26:24,932 --> 00:26:27,021
Are you sure?
Because I am

497
00:26:27,065 --> 00:26:30,677
feeling the pain that she
has inflicted upon you.

498
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,462
How deeply she's torn apart
your relationships.

499
00:26:33,506 --> 00:26:34,724
Your whole life.

500
00:26:34,768 --> 00:26:36,944
Actually, the suffering
she's caused is

501
00:26:36,988 --> 00:26:38,946
- ... quite beautiful.
- That wasn't Nora.

502
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:40,948
She's lost control.
Just like you have.

503
00:26:40,992 --> 00:26:43,081
But if you let me,
I can help you both.

504
00:26:43,124 --> 00:26:44,734
I don't need your help.

505
00:26:44,778 --> 00:26:48,173
Besides, I can feel
what you fear the most.

506
00:26:48,216 --> 00:26:51,263
It's the person you seek.

507
00:26:51,306 --> 00:26:53,961
Well, your wish is my command.

508
00:27:10,282 --> 00:27:12,327
Sweet dreams,
my beautiful boy.

509
00:27:16,723 --> 00:27:18,203
You'll never measure up.

510
00:27:22,685 --> 00:27:24,339
Okay. It's working.

511
00:27:24,383 --> 00:27:26,994
Now, when you're close enough
to cycle particles,

512
00:27:27,038 --> 00:27:28,996
the disc will light up.

513
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,216
Guys, I appreciate you
helping me.

514
00:27:31,259 --> 00:27:33,435
Make sure the proton
collection housing's

515
00:27:33,479 --> 00:27:35,524
double-fused.

516
00:27:35,568 --> 00:27:37,831
We did.

517
00:27:37,874 --> 00:27:40,138
And it's good to see you.

518
00:27:40,181 --> 00:27:41,922
What changed your mind?

519
00:27:41,966 --> 00:27:43,880
Look, this is dangerous.

520
00:27:43,924 --> 00:27:46,100
And it doesn't feel right.

521
00:27:48,189 --> 00:27:51,627
But I'm always gonna
have your back.

522
00:27:51,671 --> 00:27:52,977
No matter what.

523
00:27:56,937 --> 00:27:58,808
Chester. Let's get it going.

524
00:27:58,852 --> 00:28:00,506
Okay, so. Barry.

525
00:28:00,549 --> 00:28:02,638
All you need to do is
get close enough to the

526
00:28:02,682 --> 00:28:06,077
Speed Force lightning to
collect a sample of each force.

527
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:11,212
The PHC and Timeless Wells'
time bubble should do the rest.

528
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:13,388
Theoretically.

529
00:28:15,434 --> 00:28:16,739
Ready?

530
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,924
Nothing's happening.

531
00:28:27,968 --> 00:28:30,710
- You gonna--
- Wait for it.

532
00:28:30,753 --> 00:28:31,841
Wait for it.

533
00:28:40,067 --> 00:28:42,026
Incredible.

534
00:28:42,069 --> 00:28:44,028
We're at 100% organic speed.

535
00:28:44,071 --> 00:28:45,812
We need you...

536
00:28:45,855 --> 00:28:47,161
I need you.

537
00:29:04,396 --> 00:29:06,789
I remember this moment.

538
00:29:06,833 --> 00:29:09,575
This is where it all started.

539
00:29:15,798 --> 00:29:17,974
We should get to the roof.

540
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:50,094
You think you can be
a good wife?

541
00:29:50,137 --> 00:29:52,096
Good mother?

542
00:29:52,139 --> 00:29:54,359
But you never will.

543
00:29:54,402 --> 00:29:58,189
Everything you do pales
in comparison to me.

544
00:29:58,232 --> 00:30:01,583
Besides...
how could you be a good mother

545
00:30:01,627 --> 00:30:04,934
if you never even had one?
- I'm not listening to you.

546
00:30:04,978 --> 00:30:06,371
You don't have to.

547
00:30:06,414 --> 00:30:07,372
You already know
it's the truth.

548
00:30:07,415 --> 00:30:09,287
No. You're not real.

549
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:11,506
There's no escaping
your own fear.

550
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:14,335
I know you're still here,
Psych.

551
00:30:15,162 --> 00:30:17,773
Very good. Mm.

552
00:30:17,817 --> 00:30:19,340
It is not every day that

553
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:22,256
somebody can sense my presence
in their nightmare.

554
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:25,216
I'm not just someone.
We have a connection.

555
00:30:25,259 --> 00:30:26,956
I know you can feel that too.

556
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,785
Perhaps. It's not going to
help you, though.

557
00:30:29,829 --> 00:30:32,527
Escape one nightmare and I'll
just serve up another.

558
00:30:32,571 --> 00:30:36,183
Because there's always more
terror to unlock.

559
00:30:43,582 --> 00:30:45,018
But before you
had those powers,

560
00:30:45,061 --> 00:30:48,282
before you became a force.
You were a person.

561
00:30:48,326 --> 00:30:50,980
I'm talking to that person
right now.

562
00:30:51,024 --> 00:30:52,634
I have friends. I have a team.

563
00:30:52,678 --> 00:30:55,202
They can help you fight this
monster that's inside of you.

564
00:30:55,246 --> 00:30:57,422
We can help you regain control
of your body.

565
00:30:57,465 --> 00:31:00,599
What makes you think
I'm not in control?

566
00:31:00,642 --> 00:31:03,732
I know you didn't...
choose to have these powers.

567
00:31:03,776 --> 00:31:06,387
And you shouldn't have to
go through this alone.

568
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:08,607
I know that we're not flesh
and blood.

569
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:10,913
But in a way...

570
00:31:10,957 --> 00:31:14,308
I'm--I'm like a parent.

571
00:31:16,354 --> 00:31:19,705
So please let me help you.

572
00:31:44,904 --> 00:31:47,863
Well, then there's something
I should tell you, Mother.

573
00:31:47,907 --> 00:31:50,039
I hated my parents.

574
00:32:14,412 --> 00:32:16,544
The isotopic energy readings
are going down.

575
00:32:16,588 --> 00:32:18,720
The forces are dying.

576
00:32:25,249 --> 00:32:26,554
These fools gonna learn.

577
00:32:26,598 --> 00:32:28,600
You mess with Deon.
You get dealt with.

578
00:32:37,391 --> 00:32:40,525
Another 20 seconds, and
they'll be gone forever.

579
00:32:41,265 --> 00:32:44,268
Barry did it.

580
00:32:44,311 --> 00:32:46,270
Okay.

581
00:32:46,313 --> 00:32:48,315
Wait...wait.

582
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:50,491
What is that?

583
00:32:55,235 --> 00:32:59,979
I think that is an act
of creation.

584
00:33:03,504 --> 00:33:05,637
I have the particles.

585
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,682
Shouldn't the forces be dying?

586
00:33:07,726 --> 00:33:11,295
Perhaps they are.
Somewhere.

587
00:33:11,338 --> 00:33:15,429
In time, but right here?
Right now?

588
00:33:15,473 --> 00:33:18,084
They're being born.

589
00:33:32,185 --> 00:33:33,795
What are you doing to me?

590
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:35,580
I wasn't able to get
through to him.

591
00:33:35,623 --> 00:33:38,539
And now it's too late.
- Boss, we can't stay here.

592
00:33:52,118 --> 00:33:53,685
Allen.

593
00:33:53,728 --> 00:33:55,817
You okay?

594
00:33:55,861 --> 00:34:01,606
Never judge your kids
for who they are now.

595
00:34:01,649 --> 00:34:08,439
You help them become
who they know they can be.

596
00:34:08,482 --> 00:34:10,354
They're almost gone.

597
00:34:10,397 --> 00:34:11,833
5%.

598
00:34:11,877 --> 00:34:12,965
4...

599
00:34:16,011 --> 00:34:17,099
3%...

600
00:34:20,886 --> 00:34:22,366
2%...

601
00:34:55,529 --> 00:34:56,704
What's happening?

602
00:34:56,748 --> 00:34:58,663
Everything just stopped.

603
00:34:58,706 --> 00:35:00,708
The numbers
are going back up.

604
00:35:00,752 --> 00:35:03,494
It's as if the forces
are still here...

605
00:35:07,585 --> 00:35:09,195
Iris was right.

606
00:35:09,238 --> 00:35:11,458
You all were.

607
00:35:11,502 --> 00:35:14,722
I--

608
00:35:14,766 --> 00:35:16,289
I couldn't do it.

609
00:35:30,231 --> 00:35:33,190
Iris...

610
00:35:33,234 --> 00:35:34,191
I'm sorry.

611
00:35:34,235 --> 00:35:35,279
Yeah, me too.

612
00:35:43,113 --> 00:35:44,854
Barry, I--um...

613
00:35:44,898 --> 00:35:46,595
I went looking for Nora.

614
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:48,945
I thought that if I could just
talk to her,

615
00:35:48,989 --> 00:35:51,382
that I could fix everything.

616
00:35:51,426 --> 00:35:53,036
But, um.

617
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:56,562
I ended up finding Psychinstead.

618
00:35:56,605 --> 00:35:57,737
You were right.

619
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,565
I couldn't get through to him.

620
00:35:59,608 --> 00:36:03,438
And it probably would have been
the same with Nora.

621
00:36:03,481 --> 00:36:04,874
I should have listened to you.

622
00:36:04,918 --> 00:36:07,877
No, I'm the one who should
have listened.

623
00:36:10,271 --> 00:36:12,708
Harrison told me about
the birth of the forces.

624
00:36:12,752 --> 00:36:15,319
Sounds incredible.

625
00:36:15,363 --> 00:36:17,234
It was.

626
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:21,587
Can't believe how close I came
to erasing them.

627
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:25,591
- What changed your mind?
- You.

628
00:36:25,634 --> 00:36:28,419
Joe. Everyone.

629
00:36:28,463 --> 00:36:31,597
Even the forces themselves.

630
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,076
I could...

631
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:37,472
I could feel how they would
affect the future.

632
00:36:37,515 --> 00:36:40,649
All the speedsters' and heroes'
lives they'd shape.

633
00:36:40,693 --> 00:36:44,131
Some of them were family,
Iris.

634
00:36:44,174 --> 00:36:47,308
Our family.

635
00:36:47,351 --> 00:36:49,745
Barry, we both know how
dangerous these forces can be.

636
00:36:49,789 --> 00:36:51,181
I mean, if you couldn't
uncreate them,

637
00:36:51,225 --> 00:36:54,097
and I couldn't get through toPsych...

638
00:36:54,141 --> 00:36:56,534
What are we supposed to do?
- Try again.

639
00:36:56,578 --> 00:36:58,580
Together this time.

640
00:36:58,624 --> 00:37:01,452
Joe helped me realize
that we can't judge

641
00:37:01,496 --> 00:37:04,934
Psych and Deon
for who they are now.

642
00:37:04,978 --> 00:37:08,068
We have to help them become
who they can grow up to be.

643
00:37:08,111 --> 00:37:10,244
'Cause
that's what parents do.

644
00:37:17,294 --> 00:37:18,295
Alexa.

645
00:37:23,779 --> 00:37:25,694
- What happened?
- There was a tremor.

646
00:37:25,738 --> 00:37:28,436
And Alexa sat up
and looked at me.

647
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:30,003
Alexa's alive?

648
00:37:30,046 --> 00:37:33,310
She was for a second,
but she's not anymore.

649
00:37:33,354 --> 00:37:37,140
Which doesn't make any sense,
medically speaking.

650
00:37:37,184 --> 00:37:38,968
What if us being back in sync

651
00:37:39,012 --> 00:37:40,840
is what woke her up for
the moment?

652
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:43,843
And then she reconnected
with the Strength Force.

653
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:49,413
Is it crazy to think
that we did this?

654
00:37:49,457 --> 00:37:51,067
No.

655
00:37:51,111 --> 00:37:52,982
'Cause we're all connected.

656
00:37:53,026 --> 00:37:55,158
And if we woke her up once.

657
00:37:55,202 --> 00:37:58,988
Then we could bring her back
permanently?

658
00:38:40,987 --> 00:38:43,293
Why is everyone looking at me?

659
00:38:51,171 --> 00:38:54,130
Listen.
I'd ask you to say, but...

660
00:38:54,174 --> 00:38:55,828
I already know the answer.

661
00:38:55,871 --> 00:38:58,395
A man's gotta be
where his heart lies.

662
00:38:59,832 --> 00:39:04,750
He's just gotta learn to
listen to it.

663
00:39:11,017 --> 00:39:14,716
One more thing
before I go.

664
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,197
Whether it's me...

665
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:23,246
or any of the many Wells
predecessors,

666
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:26,989
I want you to know
that you taught us

667
00:39:27,033 --> 00:39:30,863
every inch as much
as we taught you.

668
00:39:30,906 --> 00:39:32,603
Maybe more.

669
00:39:45,965 --> 00:39:48,794
Yeah, I'm never gonna
get used to that.

670
00:39:52,885 --> 00:39:56,497
You okay?

671
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:58,891
Yeah.

672
00:39:58,934 --> 00:40:01,458
For the first time
in a long while.

673
00:40:01,502 --> 00:40:03,809
Yeah, I feel okay.

674
00:40:05,158 --> 00:40:06,376
Good.

675
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:08,291
Um...'cause I've been thinking
about something.

676
00:40:08,335 --> 00:40:12,861
And after tonight,
I know I have to do it.

677
00:40:12,905 --> 00:40:15,211
Okay, that's just weird.

678
00:40:15,255 --> 00:40:21,087
I was literally about to say
the exact same thing to you.

679
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:23,829
I have to leave
Central City.

680
00:40:26,483 --> 00:40:28,050
Thank God.

681
00:40:28,094 --> 00:40:31,010
Are you kidding me?

682
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:32,576
Oh, my God.

683
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:35,971
Babe, what are you gonna
tell Team Citizen?

684
00:40:36,015 --> 00:40:38,844
What are you gonna tell
Team Flash?

685
00:41:06,262 --> 00:41:08,961
You're the one
who's after me?

686
00:41:09,004 --> 00:41:11,180
You don't look so tough.

687
00:41:19,972 --> 00:41:21,495
What are you?

688
00:41:21,538 --> 00:41:23,758
A reckoning.
