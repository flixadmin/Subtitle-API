1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,480
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,960
You are cop in everything but name.

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,840
So even Gotham is not my job anymore.

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,040
The person who comes into contact
with my blood, it changes him.

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,040
It affects every person differently.

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,040
My God. They really want me as Mayor.

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,360
How would you know I would win?

8
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,920
I believe in you, Oswald,

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,800
even when you don't believe
in yourself.

10
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,560
- Miss Kringle.
- No, my name is Isabella.

11
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,560
You remind me of someone.
I'm Edward Nygma.

12
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,160
Past is the past.

13
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,240
I know that we can't change the past.

14
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,640
But there's difference between
moving on and letting go.

15
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,880
Who do you love?

16
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,200
Or I shoot both of them
which would be such a thrill.

17
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,400
Kill Lee.

18
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm so sorry this happened.

19
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,080
Stop the press.

20
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,360
Tough guy Jim Gordon
sheds tear for Valerie Vale.

21
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,680
How're you feeling?

22
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,040
Like a bullet went
through my insides.

23
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,800
- You don't have any whisky, do you?
- Sorry.

24
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,120
You get a girl shot
and don't even bring her booze.

25
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,800
You got a lot of nerve.

26
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,400
I never meant for you to get hurt.

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,120
You did.

28
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,080
You wanted to save Lee.

29
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,680
I wanted to saved you both.

30
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,880
Yeah, but you could
only save one of us.

31
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,760
That's why you told Tetch to kill Lee

32
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,040
because you knew
he would do the opposite.

33
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,520
Oldest trick in the book.

34
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,840
At least tell me you caught him.

35
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,440
He's still in the wind. Listen.

36
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,400
- Vale, it's not what you think.
- It is.

37
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,800
You love Lee.

38
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,640
Which means we're done.

39
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,760
- If there's anything I can do...
- No.

40
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,000
No, Tetch was right.

41
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,400
You're nothing but trouble.

42
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,440
So let me get this straight,

43
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,200
you're about to be in possession
of some kind of virus.

44
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,920
Yes.

45
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,240
It's blood based and can be
a little unpredictable.

46
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,080
It can take weeks
for symptoms to manifest.

47
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,280
Oh.

48
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,080
This...

49
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,920
is an accelerant.

50
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,600
Mix it with the blood, wham bam.

51
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,640
That virus will hit them
like a semi going 90.

52
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,120
The Red Queen.

53
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,840
She's a blend of psychotropic plants.

54
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,400
Thought she'd be a big hit.

55
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,000
Turns out she's only good at
putting people in the looney bin.

56
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,000
- I'll take her.
- That stuff's no joke.

57
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,640
At first, it incapacitates you.

58
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,560
Then an hour into the trip
completely fries your brain.

59
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,120
Perfect.

60
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,400
I'm looking to side-line someone
before this evening's event.

61
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,600
That will do it.

62
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:38,040
Hey, what exactly are you planning?

63
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:52,560
This city tore my love from me
so I'm plunging it into insanity.

64
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,240
And that's where I discovered
my love of books?

65
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,040
I never thought a fractured
tibia would launch

66
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,280
my library career but it did.

67
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,000
{\an5}Fun fact of the tibia is second
largest bone in the body.

68
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,680
{\an5}Second only to the femur.

69
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,120
{\an5}You have exquisite femurs.

70
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,360
{\an5}- Morning paper.
- Yeah.

71
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,680
{\an5}- What time is it?
- Oh, it's just past six.

72
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,880
{\an5}Edward...

73
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,240
{\an5}this past 12 hours have been
the best of my life.

74
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,240
{\an5}When can we meet me again?

75
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,520
{\an5}What can't you have for breakfast
or lunch?

76
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
{\an5}Dinner.

77
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,800
{\an5}- I'd love to.
- Delightful.

78
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,600
{\an5}Meet me at the Mayor's
Mansion at eight.

79
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,360
{\an5}I understand that one is expected
to wait 24 hours

80
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,200
{\an5}before filing a missing
person's report,

81
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,160
{\an5}- but sir, I'm the Mayor...
- Oswald.

82
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,640
I am so sorry.

83
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,840
When you didn't come home
I assumed the worst.

84
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,360
I'm so glad you're okay.

85
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,840
Better than okay.

86
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,240
{\an5}I met someone.

87
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,600
{\an5}I think I'm in love!

88
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,800
{\an5}Hey! Hey, you can't be down here.

89
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,720
Oh, I disagree.

90
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,080
{\an5}I don't understand
why we're doing all this, boss.

91
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,240
{\an5}Wasn't plugging Gordon's
girlfriend enough?

92
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,600
Jim Gordon wasn't the only one
responsible for my sister's death.

93
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:29,600
Gotham ripped Alice from my loving
arms and turned her against me.

94
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,720
What better way to make this city pay
than by spreading my dear,

95
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,480
dead sister's legacy?

96
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,160
Oh, Alice.

97
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,280
Well, it's quite the operation
you've got going on here,

98
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,600
isn't it, Master Bruce?

99
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,400
- Do you need a hand?
- I got it.

100
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,600
Right.

101
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,440
- What time to expect Miss Kyle?
- 6.00, I think.

102
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,720
I see. All right.

103
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,440
She's coming, Alfred.

104
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,680
And Alfred...

105
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,480
Yes, yes, I know it.

106
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,440
I'll make myself scarce, so I'll give
you the privacy that you need.

107
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,560
Within earshot.

108
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,080
And the lights on.

109
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,720
Well, I got bad news and worse.

110
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,960
Skip the preamble.

111
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,440
It was definitely Tetch
and his two dum-dums.

112
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,560
And? What about Alice's body?

113
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,800
The eggheads here have had her
body on ice since it arrived.

114
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,920
Her blood's frozen but still viable.

115
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,160
- The second Tetch heats it up...
- He has himself the virus.

116
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,960
How the hell did he even get in here?

117
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,440
The old fashioned way,
somebody let him in.

118
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,080
I got an unconscious lab tech
and a missing guard.

119
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,720
My money's on the guard.

120
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,360
Shouldn't you be
at the hospital with Vale?

121
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,000
She's fine. Give me the rundown.

122
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,480
Oh, so I take it
you're re-joining the force?

123
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,400
I just wanna help.

124
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,440
There's no reason
I need to be a cop to do that.

125
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,640
As long as I'm captain of the GCPD,
you do.

126
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,640
I'm tired of giving you slack.

127
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,680
Get the hell off my crime scene
before I throw your ass in lock-up.

128
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,160
Biehls. Alban.

129
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,240
Escort Mr. Gordon off the premises.

130
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,240
If he resists,
book him for obstruction.

131
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,160
I'll go on my own.

132
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,920
Oh, hey, hey, hey. No.

133
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,760
I see that look in your eye.
Don't try to solve this by yourself.

134
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,040
Then help me.

135
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,280
If Tetch has Alice's blood,
we don't have much time.

136
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,600
No, I'm not gonna aid you

137
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,200
with your solo bull crap kamikaze
missions anymore.

138
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,960
Tetch murdered four people yesterday.

139
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,880
He shot Vale. I can't just
let him get away with it.

140
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,200
Nobody's asking you to.
But Barnes is right.

141
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,640
Either be a cop or don't.

142
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,400
What are you so afraid of?

143
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,480
Is that what you think?

144
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,720
That I'm afraid?

145
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,680
You know, you should go
to the hospital, be with Vale.

146
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:22,600
And let those of us who wanna
wear the badge do our damn jobs.

147
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,400
You are going to cut
quite the fine figure

148
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,760
at the Founders dinner tonight.

149
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,120
Yes.

150
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,440
Did you know that this dinner
has been thrown annually

151
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,960
for over 200 years?

152
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,600
It was started by
the first families of Gotham.

153
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,680
Only the most powerful
citizens are invited.

154
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,080
It's a shame I don't get a plus one.

155
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,400
I can't go anyway. I have a date.

156
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,240
With the woman
you claim to be in love with

157
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,080
after only knowing for a few hours?

158
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,240
The heart keeps its own time.

159
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,240
I'm partial to the purple.

160
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,400
The brocade brings out my eyes.

161
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,040
Are you sure you aren't mistaking
infatuation for love?

162
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,240
You did say she's the spitting
image of Kringle.

163
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,760
Isabella's beautiful and smart.

164
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:19,320
So she bears a passing
resemblance to Kristin?

165
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,400
It's just the universe telling me.

166
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,760
Telling me I have a second
chance of love.

167
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,800
Where did you say she works?

168
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,200
The Main Public Library.
You read about the brocade.

169
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,720
Do you mind if I skedaddle?

170
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,960
I just need to pick up
a few things for tonight.

171
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,120
Who am I to stand in the way of love?

172
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,360
The missing guard from the lab.
Called in sick.

173
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,800
My gut says he's lying.

174
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,280
Oh, he's certainly
no candidate for sainthood.

175
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,440
Gambling. Petty theft.

176
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,760
Might I have a word, Captain?

177
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,560
Bring him in.

178
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
What is it?

179
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,320
I just heard
from the head of Virology

180
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,760
at the Biomedical Facility.

181
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,080
This is about the tests they were
running on Alice's Tetch's blood?

182
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,800
- Yes, in the first trial...
- One of the rats went off

183
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,440
the rails and murdered the rest,
they know.

184
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,600
Doctor Thompkins told me.

185
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,080
But she thought,
there might have been an anomaly.

186
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,520
I'm afraid the second study
proves otherwise.

187
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,840
As in the first study,
the rats showed increased strength

188
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,760
and agility but, by week two.

189
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,040
The rats were exhibiting
manic tendencies.

190
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,520
Violent rage.

191
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,360
By the study's end,
every trace of their original

192
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,880
demeanour had vanished.

193
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:35,520
- I assume they're working on a cure?
- Yes, but it could take years.

194
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,400
And we all have hours...

195
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,560
Damn it.

196
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,680
If this virus gets set free...

197
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,480
- We have to find Tetch. Now.
- Yes.

198
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,920
Watch closely, Deever.

199
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,720
Isn't science marvellous?

200
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,400
Gravity, a few heaters and voila!

201
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,680
The last drops of coagulated blood

202
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,640
become cocktail mix.

203
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,000
Bravo, Alice.

204
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,120
Truly, your best work.

205
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,880
- You're kidding me.
- Please calm down.

206
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,160
He said, "Kill Lee."

207
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,360
- He knew Tetch wouldn't.
- How?

208
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,160
How could he possibly
have known that?

209
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,320
It, somehow,
he got inside Tetch's head.

210
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,360
And he knew that
he would do the opposite

211
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,200
- of what he told him to do.
- I see.

212
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,400
So why would Gordon
offer up the woman

213
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,120
he's dating in the place
of my fiancé?

214
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,560
Mario, stop it.

215
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,720
We have so much to be thankful for.
I just wanna move past this.

216
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,040
Fine.

217
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,520
But Jim Gordon is the reason
you were in danger to begin with.

218
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,840
- I want him out of our lives.
- Of course.

219
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,200
I came by to bring this to Vale.

220
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,360
I gotta get back to the ER.

221
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,320
He's angry.

222
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,240
I get that.

223
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,600
He has every reason to be.

224
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,200
I figured you'd be out
chasing down Tetch.

225
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,600
Barnes banned me.

226
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,480
No badge. No investigation.

227
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,080
It's never stopped you before.

228
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,840
They closed ranks. Even Bullock.

229
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,240
He says I'm refusing the badge
because I'm afraid.

230
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,920
Jim. I know what you did. Last night.

231
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,880
When you told Tetch to kill me,
you knew he would shoot Vale.

232
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,480
No. I'm sorry. That's not true.

233
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,120
At least have the decency
to be honest with me.

234
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,520
I am being honest.

235
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,600
I wanted to save Vale.

236
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,040
Bullock was right,

237
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,200
you are afraid.

238
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,560
- Hello, there.
- Mr. Mayor, what an honour.

239
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,760
How can I help you?

240
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,760
I am attending the Founders
dinner this evening

241
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,000
and I wanted to brush up
on the history

242
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,880
of Gotham's first families.

243
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,480
My chief of staff suggested
I come here.

244
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,960
I think you might know him.

245
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,680
Yes. I know Edward.

246
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,840
We just met but...

247
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,200
well, I feel I've known
him my whole life.

248
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,800
- How romantic.
- Oh. Listen to me. Blathering on.

249
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,240
You wanted a book.

250
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,680
I'm so glad you appreciate Ed.

251
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,200
Really, I should thank you
for brightening Ed's spirits.

252
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,960
He has been so down
since he got out of Arkham.

253
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,160
Edward was in Arkham?

254
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,480
You don't know?

255
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,440
It was front page news.

256
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,280
I stick to books.

257
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:00,760
Don't people typically go
to Arkham for murder?

258
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:07,360
I make it a policy not to gossip
about staff but yes.

259
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,840
Uncanny how much you look like her.

260
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,440
It's that swan-like neck.

261
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,120
Ed loves a neck.

262
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,840
Well, thank you for the book.
It was a pleasure meeting you.

263
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,720
Hey. Hey!

264
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,240
Hey!

265
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,400
The tea party was part one.

266
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,360
I wanna have a lot more fun.

267
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,600
I had my way with you.

268
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,040
Now, Gotham's up for round two.

269
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,760
What the hell are you talking about?

270
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:31,120
Why, I'm going to dismantle
your beloved city,

271
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,040
from the top on down.

272
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,280
And you can't stop me.

273
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,720
Enjoy the trip.

274
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,840
It's gonna be a bumpy ride.

275
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,400
Watch where you're going.

276
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,160
Of course, Mr. Mayor.

277
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,960
So sorry.

278
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,200
Cretin.

279
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,440
Jim.

280
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,800
Jim.

281
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,760
Jim!

282
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,760
Finally, Sleeping Beauty stirs.

283
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,760
- Where am I?
- You got dosed, buttercup.

284
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,520
Welcome to your hallucination.

285
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,400
- What are you doing in it?
- Hell, if I know.

286
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,600
Now, we've got a lot
to be getting on with.

287
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,440
I don't have time for this.

288
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,320
See that's the thing
about hallucinations, Jimbo.

289
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,440
You gotta ride out the trip. Bummer?

290
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,800
What exactly does this trip entail?

291
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,800
Well, no one gave me an itinerary.

292
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,320
But knowing what goes on
inside of your head,

293
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,440
it'll be chock full of belly laughs.

294
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,880
Just kidding.
We all know fun isn't your forte.

295
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,520
This is where I face my inner demons?

296
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,520
That's up to you.

297
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,320
Well, go on.

298
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,320
Unless you wanna stay
in this tiny space with me.

299
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,280
I'll take my chances.

300
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,600
Jim.

301
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,440
Jim. Jim.

302
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,520
Bruce.

303
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,320
You don't have much time.

304
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,640
What are you talking about?

305
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,200
- You don't have much time.
- Bruce!

306
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,680
Bruce!

307
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,280
Where did Bruce go?

308
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:53,120
(Foreign Language)

309
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,400
What?

310
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,840
You never leave your unit behind.

311
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,200
I have to find him.

312
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,920
Bruce! Bruce!

313
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,800
I'm glad you came.

314
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,240
What did you mean when you said
I didn't have much time?

315
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,600
I just wanted you to follow me.

316
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,920
So I could show you that.

317
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,000
Down there.

318
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,640
It's because of you.

319
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,120
Congratulations, Jim. You did it.

320
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,640
You're the hero you always
dreamed of being.

321
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,800
Bruce. Don't.

322
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,560
Your name was on the schedule.

323
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,880
Yeah, I told you.

324
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,800
It was my shift at the Bio-Lab
but I came down with something.

325
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,040
The only thing you're coming down
with, pal, is ten years at Blackgate.

326
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,520
Hey, hey, hey.

327
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,560
That's no way to treat a sick man.

328
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,840
Listen, Sullivan.

329
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,600
Tetch got in using
an employee's key card.

330
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,480
Just show us your card
and you're free to go.

331
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,800
Screw you.

332
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,520
I want a lawyer.

333
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,000
You pigs think
you're such tough guys.

334
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,640
Honest citizens driven mad.

335
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,560
Tearing each other limb from limb
just because you decided

336
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,920
that this city's security
is not your concern!

337
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,600
Tell us what you know
about Jervis Tetch!

338
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,120
Tell us what you know
about Jervis Tetch!

339
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,600
Stop! Please! Captain! Captain!
Captain! Captain!

340
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,880
Hey. I thought I was supposed
to be the bad cop here.

341
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,120
A bruiser in a wrestling mask paid me

342
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,400
to hand over my key card
and take the day off.

343
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,920
Promised I wouldn't get in trouble.

344
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,400
Said the cops will be too busy
taking back control of the city.

345
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,120
And? Tell us something
that might actually help.

346
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,960
He was driving a catering van.

347
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,200
Why would the Tweeds
need a catering van?

348
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,360
- Wait. What's the date?
- Friday.

349
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,560
- The date.
- The 27th.

350
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,520
The Founders dinner.

351
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:36,120
The Archbishop, the Comptroller,
the Mayor all in the same place.

352
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,960
Put together a unit.

353
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,240
And not a word to Gordon.

354
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,160
A drop of blood.

355
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,480
In each one glass.

356
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,560
Makes madmen of the ruling class.

357
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,520
- What the hell are you doing?
- Saving your life. Like you wanted.

358
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,480
The last thing I want
is your lips on my mouth.

359
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:27,520
Newsflash. Everything
that is happening is in your head.

360
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,720
Which means you made me give you
CPR.

361
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:33,760
Just like you put me in this really
cheesy nurse's uniform.

362
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,920
That's easily rectified.

363
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,440
Seriously?
One bad encounter with Bruce.

364
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,800
I don't wanna talk about it.

365
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,280
Fine, just don't fall into
a monosyllabic depression because...

366
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,080
we're at the next stop.

367
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,160
I have mixed feelings
about this floor.

368
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,240
I'm afraid to ask.

369
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,720
I'm so glad you're home.

370
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,560
Mum thought you were gonna be late.

371
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,160
Mum owes me a quarter. Mum!

372
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,160
We made a bet
that you were gonna be late.

373
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,840
Frankie had more faith than I did.
Now, go on.

374
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,520
Take those rolls to the table.

375
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,160
How was your trip?

376
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,720
Earth to Jim.

377
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,480
Sorry. You just look so beautiful.

378
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,000
You guys are gross.

379
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,880
Julie, one day
you're gonna love somebody

380
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,800
as much as I love your father.

381
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,800
- Never. Boys are dumb.
- Are not!

382
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,120
You feeling okay, honey?

383
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,280
I'm just glad to be here.
With you guys.

384
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,280
I love you so much.

385
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,520
Does that mean we can get a dog?

386
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,360
You two.

387
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,840
Does that mean we can get a dog?

388
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,800
- Sure.
- Yes. You're the best, Dad!

389
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,440
The best!

390
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,600
Just the best, Jim.

391
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,360
No, no, no. No, no, come back!

392
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,800
You look like you need a drink.

393
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,360
Jim.

394
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,920
Open the damn gate, Barbara.

395
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,120
I need to get back to them. To her.

396
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,320
If you're so desperate to have
Thompkins and the two kids,

397
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,080
why're you in that crappy apartment
playing private dick?

398
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,240
Let go of me.

399
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,720
You don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

400
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,640
I know you're lost.
You wanna find your way home?

401
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,120
Play nice.

402
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,080
It's a long way to the basement.

403
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,200
So.

404
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,440
The little minx was a no show?

405
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,960
Well, it seems a frightful shame

406
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,800
to let this beautiful
meal go to waste.

407
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,120
What do you say we wrap it up
and have it for lunch tomorrow.

408
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,520
Hey.

409
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,520
You always bring your butler
along on dates?

410
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,920
All right.

411
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,440
I'll leave you to it.

412
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,840
Excuse me, miss.

413
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,800
You're late.

414
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,240
Stuff came up.

415
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,200
Geez. Chill.

416
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,880
Alfred really outdid himself.

417
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,200
I made all of it. For you.

418
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,680
What's with the attitude?

419
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,880
You stood me up.

420
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,760
I got busy.

421
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,840
Selina, if we're gonna do this,

422
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,920
whatever this is...

423
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,680
I need you to be honest with me.

424
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,360
This. Me and you.

425
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,600
It's weird for me.

426
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:02,040
Okay? It's weird for me.

427
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,200
It's weird for me too.

428
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:10,320
So are you gonna cut the cake,
or what?

429
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,440
Of course, I didn't wanna
stand in the way of love,

430
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,320
but this woman would
have been a disaster.

431
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,240
It sounds as if you did
your friend a favour.

432
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,960
I'm sorry,
I have been talking so much.

433
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,840
I never asked your name.

434
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,000
Kathryn.

435
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,880
Just Kathryn.

436
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,680
How did you end up
at the Founders dinner?

437
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,040
- If it's not rude for me to ask.
- Not at all.

438
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,600
I'm from one of Gotham's
oldest families.

439
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:53,160
And I'm part of a group
which oversees things.

440
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,680
What sort of things?

441
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,640
Everything that matters in Gotham.

442
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:04,000
We've had our eye on you
for some time, Mr. Cobblepot.

443
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,120
Who exactly are you?

444
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,600
We'll contact you
when the time is right.

445
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,200
Enjoy your evening.

446
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,800
Excuse me, did you notice the rather

447
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,680
severe-looking woman
I was speaking with?

448
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,120
- She said her name...
- Nobody move!

449
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,800
What is this? What is going on?

450
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,840
I'm afraid your evening
has been hijacked, Mr. Mayor.

451
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,600
I see the champagne
didn't leave a mark.

452
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,800
I'm so glad.

453
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:57,360
For those of you who don't know me,
my name is Jervis Tetch.

454
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,440
I promise not to take up
too much of your time.

455
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,240
But the fact is,
you are the heads of Gotham.

456
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:07,760
And tonight,
the heads of Gotham will roll.

457
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,200
But first...

458
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,280
a toast.

459
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,840
A drink.

460
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,280
- To your health.
- And if we don't?

461
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,960
Change, my friends, is nigh.

462
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,280
Drink the wine.

463
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,120
Or else you die.

464
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,880
Glasses down. Now! Glasses down!

465
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:51,440
Oh, my! Is that my dear sister I see?

466
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,480
She's in you, isn't she?

467
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,960
What fun!

468
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,360
What fun!

469
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,880
Shut up! Shut up!

470
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,800
Last stop.

471
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,760
Don't be scared.

472
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:28,200
It's not easy to face
who you really are.

473
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,600
I should know.

474
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,440
Do you ever wish you were
the person you used to be?

475
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,000
Do you?

476
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,120
Use this.

477
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,320
Or don't.

478
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,480
It's up to you.

479
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,200
Good luck, Jim.

480
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,120
Sir.

481
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,480
Sir.

482
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,200
You're looking for this?

483
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,680
- Dad?
- Hey!

484
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,960
It's good to see you, son.

485
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,360
I'm always losing that darn thing.

486
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,280
Get in. We don't wanna be late.

487
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:06,880
Doctor. Doctor. Some help.
Doctor, he's unconscious.

488
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,720
Doctor Calvi, he's in here.

489
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:10,800
Jim.

490
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,200
Jim.

491
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,720
This was beside him.

492
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:19,040
Red Queen. I've heard of this.

493
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,600
- Give me 20 CC's of Haloperidol.
- Right away, Doctor.

494
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,440
Jim, can you hear me? Jim?

495
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,560
Jim!

496
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,720
Come on, Jimmy.

497
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,680
It's time to go.

498
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,960
- Something wrong?
- No.

499
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,800
I'm just glad to see you.
I missed you. A lot.

500
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,760
Sorry, I haven't been around more.

501
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,920
I heard you got into some
kind of trouble.

502
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,360
You wanna talk about it?

503
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,920
When I was a kid

504
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:11,640
people would tell me,
"Your dad's a hero."

505
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:16,160
All I knew was you went to court
every day and every night,

506
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,880
you came home and you played ball
with me while Mum made dinner.

507
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,640
Then I got older.

508
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,160
And I understood you were a hero.

509
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,960
Only for me, it wasn't just
that you'd been a great DA.

510
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,760
Since you got up, day after day...

511
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,200
you faced down the worst
the city had to offer,

512
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,400
but you never brought that home
to Mum and me.

513
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,880
You protected us.

514
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,880
I wanted to be just like you.

515
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,720
Turns out I'm the opposite.

516
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,680
I destroy everything
and everyone around me.

517
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,480
Don't. Come on, Jimmy.

518
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,880
I'm far from perfect.

519
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,360
I've got plenty of darkness
inside me.

520
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,920
I just don't dwell on it.

521
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,880
Focus on the good you can do.
That's what counts.

522
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,040
- That's what I'm trying to do.
- No.

523
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:15,320
You hide behind self-righteous lone
wolf nonsense because you're afraid.

524
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,760
Why is that?

525
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:21,760
Badge holds expectations.
People want a hero.

526
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,960
And I'm not.

527
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,840
You know what makes a hero, son?

528
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,480
A man who values protecting
others above protecting himself.

529
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,400
A man who knows his limits
but isn't afraid to fail.

530
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,080
A man who knows when to ask
for help when he needs it.

531
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,160
I wasn't always that man.

532
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,320
But damn it,
didn't stop me from trying.

533
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,200
- I don't know how to be that man.
- Sure you do.

534
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,600
You just have to follow the code.

535
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,080
What? You remember what that is?

536
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,160
No.

537
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,400
The code we Gordons
promise to live by?

538
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,120
No. Why can't I remember?

539
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,280
Because you're lost, son.

540
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,400
You wanna find your way back home?

541
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,840
The answer you're looking
for is in my ring.

542
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,680
Shoot. It's time for me to go.

543
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,960
- No. I wanna talk to you more.
- I can't.

544
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,400
- Someone's coming for me.
- No. Dad.

545
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:16,280
- No, Dad, please. Don't go. No, Dad.
- I'm proud of you, Jimmy.

546
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,640
Dad.

547
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,920
Jim!

548
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,560
- Jim, can you hear me? Jim.
- Yeah.

549
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,800
Yeah. I can hear you.

550
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,440
It's Haloperidol. Antipsychotic.

551
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,360
You were dosed with a pretty
powerful hallucinogen.

552
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,840
- It was Tetch.
- I know.

553
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,760
Someone saw him leaving the hospital.

554
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,920
You know, you're lucky.

555
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,960
Another minute
and we would've lost you.

556
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,360
Thank you.

557
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,040
- It's my job.
- Doctor Calvi.

558
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,840
We need your signature, please.

559
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,920
I'll get somebody to take the IV out.

560
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,600
Half-hour, a glass of orange juice.

561
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,880
You'll be good to go.

562
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,560
So what I did...

563
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,320
I killed my girlfriend...

564
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,160
who does look rather similar to you.

565
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,960
It was not out of malice or intent.

566
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,280
It was an accident
that I deeply regret.

567
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,640
And I was not gonna tell you this,

568
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,080
- but then...
- Edward.

569
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,640
I know what you did.

570
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,880
You do?

571
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,160
I spent the afternoon reading
every article about you.

572
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:46,360
You knew what I did and yet,
you still came on this date, anyway?

573
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,840
That's not logical.

574
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,720
Love isn't logical.

575
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:01,520
I've lived my whole life
inside the pages of books.

576
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,120
Any other men I've dated...

577
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:09,680
they didn't compare to the lovers
I spent my life with.

578
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,200
Anthony. Cleopatra.

579
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,520
Romeo and Juliet.

580
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,400
Othello and Desdemona.

581
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,680
All of whom died.

582
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,200
Edward.

583
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,720
You're the first to measure up.

584
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,400
You're the one I'm waiting for.

585
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,920
You're not scared of me?

586
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,320
Of course, I am.

587
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,640
Can't you feel how fast
my heart's beating?

588
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,960
Well, Ed, you would not
believe the night I've...

589
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,240
Oswald, good evening.

590
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,080
This is Isabella.

591
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,160
We have met.

592
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:13,560
Would you excuse me? I am very tired.

593
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:59,920
<i>Dum spiramus tuebimur.</i>

594
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,880
While we breathe...

595
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,480
we shall defend.

596
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,920
Come in.

597
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,800
Busy?

598
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:28,240
Just finishing up some
paperwork on Tetch.

599
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,920
He and the Tweeds are safe
and sound in Arkham.

600
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,040
Hopefully, that's the last
we hear from them.

601
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,680
Congratulations.

602
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:38,040
You did what I couldn't. I mean that.

603
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,440
A humble Jim Gordon.
What do you know?

604
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,040
I heard Tetch sent you on
quite the trip.

605
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,520
If it wasn't for Mario, I'd be dead.

606
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,840
Anyway, I'm not here about that.

607
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:57,160
I wanna re-join the GCPD.

608
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,280
Why the sudden change of heart?

609
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:05,600
I made a promise to someone
when I was younger.

610
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,800
I intend to keep that promise.

611
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,040
Good.

612
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,480
We need you here.

613
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,040
I need you here.

614
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,600
Welcome back, Detective.

615
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:35,360
It seems you left dinner
just in time.

616
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,640
Indeed.

617
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,560
And what did you think
of our new mayor?

618
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:45,240
My gut says once a criminal,
always a criminal.

619
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,200
Well, keep an eye on him.

620
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,240
Judgement is coming, Kathryn.

621
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,800
For all of us.
