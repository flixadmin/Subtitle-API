-<i> ( seagulls screeching )</i>

10
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,613
Is that Estermont?

11
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:18,740
Tarth, Ser Jaime.

12
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:23,078
The Sapphire Isle.

13
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,834
Why are we on
a merchant ship?

14
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,544
Why no Lannister sails?

15
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:35,299
This ship's sailing
to Oldtown.

16
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,843
We'll get off earlier
not far from Sunspear,

17
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:40,762
row ourselves
to the Dornish shore
in the night.

18
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:43,807
You ever been to Dorne?

19
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:45,517
- No.
- I have.

20
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:47,311
The Dornish are crazy.

21
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:50,314
All they want to do
is fight and fuck,
fuck and fight.

22
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:52,232
You should be happy
to go back.

23
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,235
There's nothing
like a good fight

24
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,529
to get you in the mood
for fucking.

25
00:03:57,613 --> 00:03:59,656
And there's nothing like
a fuck-mad Dornish girl

26
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,117
to clear your head
for the next fight.

27
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,161
It's how the two
work together.

28
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,371
Now we're gonna be doing
a lot of fighting, I'm sure.

29
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:08,290
Well, I am.

30
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:10,876
But I don't imagine
we'll get to stick around
for the rest.

31
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,794
Not after we've kidnapped
their princess.

32
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:14,713
We're not kidnapping
their princess.

33
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:17,883
We're rescuing my niece,
bringing her back
to her family.

34
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,218
Your niece?

35
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:29,895
I've been doing
this sort of thing
a long time.

36
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,855
- I'm good at it.
- That's why you're here.

37
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:33,774
I know.
Why are you here?

38
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:36,360
Why not send 40 of me?
Or an army?

39
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:39,071
Unlike most folks,
you've actually got one.

40
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:41,740
Because I don't want
to start a war.

41
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:45,077
That still doesn't explain
what you're doing here.

42
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:50,374
It has to be me.

43
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:55,337
If I'm putting
something like
this together,

44
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,297
a one-handed man
who happens to be

45
00:04:57,381 --> 00:05:00,133
one of the most recognizable
faces in Westeros is not--

46
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:01,843
It has to be me.

47
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:08,934
You set your brother
free, didn't you?

48
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,313
I'll bet your sister
didn't like that.

49
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,317
Varys set him free.

50
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:26,410
Well, if you ever see
the wee fucker,

51
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:27,911
give him my regards.

52
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,167
He murdered my father.

53
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:40,841
If I ever see him,
I'll split him in two.

54
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:43,260
And then I'll give
him your regards.

55
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:54,021
The Iron Bank
has called in one-tenth
of the crown's debts.

56
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:56,898
Given the expense
of rebuilding
the royal fleet--

57
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:58,358
How much can
the crown afford?

58
00:05:58,442 --> 00:05:59,860
<i>With winter coming,</i>

59
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:03,155
half what they ask,
less?

60
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:06,324
You're the Master of Coin.
How do we pay them?

61
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:08,535
House Tyrell could
front the gold

62
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,746
and the crown would
pay us back in time

63
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:14,124
or I'd have words
with my daughter.

64
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,131
You've already
given us too much.

65
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:25,343
No, we must arrange
better terms with
the Iron Bank.

66
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:27,971
- Absolutely.
- In person.

67
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:32,517
- Me?
- We must send an envoy
to the Iron Bank,

68
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:36,146
someone of importance
to show these bankers
our respect.

69
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:39,316
As the king's Master
of Coin, I can think
of no one more qualified.

70
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,485
I would be honored,
Your Grace.

71
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:45,572
The king's expressed concern
about his father-in-law's
safety on this voyage.

72
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:52,913
He's ordered
Ser Meryn to personally
lead your escort.

73
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,541
My very own
Kingsguard?

74
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,877
- Please express my--
- Safe travels, Lord Tyrell.

75
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,837
Of course.
Of course.

76
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:04,883
I'll give your regards
to the Titan of Braavos.

77
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,843
( laughs )

78
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:16,978
The small council grows
smaller and smaller.

79
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:19,397
Not small enough.

80
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:32,661
Cersei:
May I offer you some wine,
Your Holiness?

81
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,454
No.

82
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,544
The old High Septon
would have asked
the vintage.

83
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:43,839
I could say that our minds
are temples to the Seven

84
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:46,299
and should be kept pure.

85
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:49,594
But the truth is
I don't like the taste.

86
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:51,721
Hmm.

87
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:55,142
How may I serve?

88
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:58,854
All over Westeros
we hear of septs
being burned,

89
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:01,982
Silent Sisters raped,

90
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:04,109
bodies of holy men
piled in the streets.

91
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:08,238
Wars teach people
to obey the sword,
not the gods.

92
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:11,408
Perhaps the gods
need a sword of their own.

93
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,285
<i>In the days before</i>
<i>the Targaryens,</i>

94
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:16,580
the Faith Militant
dispensed the justice
of the Seven.

95
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:21,168
Well, the Faith Militant
was disarmed more than
two centuries ago.

96
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:24,880
If I explain
their holy purpose
to my son the king,

97
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:27,007
I have no doubt
he will sign a decree

98
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,967
arming the believers
you felt worthy.

99
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:33,638
An army that defends
the bodies and souls
of the common people?

100
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:36,266
An army in service
to the gods themselves.

101
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,810
And to you, of course,

102
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:41,104
as the chosen
representative
of the Seven.

103
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:43,773
An honor I never expected.

104
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,609
Or, indeed,
ever wished for.

105
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,402
Which is why
you were chosen.

106
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,907
You and I both know
how the world works.

107
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,034
Too often the wicked
are the wealthiest,

108
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:55,952
beyond the reach
of justice.

109
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:59,581
The king himself
cannot always punish
those who deserve it most.

110
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:02,834
All sinners are equal
before the gods.

111
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,551
What would you say
if I told you of a great
sinner in our very midst?

112
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:14,679
Shielded by gold
and privilege.

113
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:19,226
May the Father
judge him justly.

114
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:24,606

115

( women screaming )

127

This is
Lord Petyr Baelish's
establishment.

<i>You buggering filth!</i>

There's a special place

for your kind.

00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,241
Man: Please.
Please, I'll pay.

136
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:00,327
I'll-- I'll pay
all of you.

137
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,370
Yes, you will.

Seize him.

- Sinner.

144
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:42,452
Loras:
Get your hands off me.

145
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,912
Ser Loras
of House Tyrell,

146
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:45,997
you have broken the laws
of gods and men.

147
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:48,833
Who do you
think you are?

148
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:51,711
Justice.

149
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,637
Why is my brother
in a cell?

150
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,139
I-I don't know.

151
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:04,808
I-I didn't order it.

152
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:07,227
We both know who did.

153
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:11,314
You told me
she was returning
to Casterly Rock.

154
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:13,608
Are you saying
my mother's behind this?

155
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,652
She's jealous
you're not hers anymore.

156
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,947
<i>Arresting my brother</i>
<i>is her revenge.</i>

157
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,282
Aren't you and Mother
getting along?

158
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:23,368
( huffs )

159
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:30,750
Oh, my sweet,
sweet king.

160
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:35,755
Do you have
any affection
for me at all?

161
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,967
Of course I do.

162
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,844
You're my queen.

163
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:43,138
I can't bear
to think of my brother

164
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:46,099
locked away
in some grimy cell.

165
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:50,520
I'll set him free
for you.

166
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,021
Do you promise?

167
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,531
I demand that
Ser Loras be freed now.

168
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,324
Did I arrest him?

169
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:07,203
Well, no.

170
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,581
But y-you armed
the Faith Militant.

171
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:13,251
You gave the High Sparrow
an army.

172
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,587
I did.

173
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:19,340
And your wife has
every right to criticize.

174
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:22,385
We can't allow fanatics
to arrest the queen's brother

175
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:25,054
no matter his perversions.

176
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:28,266
Then...

177
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:30,727
can I tell Margaery
you'll have Ser Loras
released?

178
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,688
I told you,
I'm not holding Ser Loras.

179
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,440
You're the king.

180
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,358
I'm sure if you speak
to the High Sparrow,

181
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:39,903
he'll release
the poor boy.

182
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,743
Halt!

183
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:57,253
<i>( coughing, chatter )</i>

184
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:14,020
His Holiness is praying.
He will not be disturbed.

185
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:16,981
Give the order
and we'll clear out
this rabble.

186
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:21,778
You mean, kill them?

187
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,655
Here at the sept?

188
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:25,823
You'd be sending them
to meet the gods
that they love.

189
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:31,913
Man:
<i>Bastard!</i>

190
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:34,123
Man #2:
<i>You're an abomination!</i>

191
00:14:39,254 --> 00:14:41,506
Man #3:
<i>Born of sin!</i>

192
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,800
Woman:
<i>Filthy bastard!</i>

193
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,765
We'll find another way.

194
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:54,477
Man #4:
<i>Abomination!</i>

195
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,151
My queen?

196
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:09,617
There was no way
to free Ser Loras
without violence.

197
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,373
You're the King
of the Andals,

198
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,166
the Lord
of the Seven Kingdoms,

199
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,294
<i>the Protector</i>
<i>of the Realm,</i>

200
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:24,090
<i>and you let a band</i>
<i>of fanatics imprison</i>
<i>your brother by law.</i>

201
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,842
I'm going to speak
with the High Sparrow.

202
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,719
Are you?
When?

203
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:31,639
- I-I don't know.
- You don't know?

204
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:34,559
He was praying
just now.

205
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,188
I have to send word
to Grandmother.

206
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,525
Will you
come back later?

207
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:47,071
I need to be with
my family, Your Grace.

208
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:50,950
Of course.

209
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:52,535
( grunting )

210
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:54,704
Selyse:
You think highly
of this boy?

211
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,039
Good.

212
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:58,249
Stannis:
Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

213
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,835
And a bastard
by some tavern slut.

214
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:03,921
Perhaps,
but that wasn't
Ned Stark's way.

215
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:09,719
I should have
given you a son.

216
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:13,139
Not your fault.

217
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,974
Whose, then?

218
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:17,602
I gave you nothing
but weakness.

219
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,982
And deformity.

220
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:26,027
Those scars mean nothing
to the Lord of Light.

221
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,945
My lady.

222
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:30,740
Her father is the Lord's
chosen king,

223
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,451
and her father's blood
runs through her veins.

224
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,712
You march on
Winterfell soon?

225
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:49,008
We must
to beat the snows.

226
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:51,761
Once before, you put
your faith in Ser Davos

227
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,846
and left me behind.

228
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,601
I hope you won't make
that mistake again.

229
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:00,144
I won't.

230
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:04,440
I need you.

231
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:07,694
You only need faith,
my king.

232
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:13,408
And you, my lady,
what do you need?

233
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:18,079
To serve my Lord.

234
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,415
( grunting )

235
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,377
Lord Ashford.

236
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,801
Lady Caulfield.

237
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:36,097
Oh, Lord Smallwood.

238
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,849
I've never even heard
of these people.

239
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:40,435
They haven't heard
of you, either.

240
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:42,979
But we need men
and they have some.

241
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:48,151
How many men does this
Lord Mayzen have to send us?

242
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:50,653
More than Lord Wibberley.

243
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:06,169
- Not him.
-<i> I know, I'm sorry.</i>

244
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,588
But we need men
and supplies

245
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:10,214
and Roose Bolton's
the Warden of the North.

246
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:11,632
He murdered my brother.

247
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:14,844
We swore to be
the watchers on the Wall.

248
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:18,514
We can't watch the Wall
with 50 men.

249
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,183
And we can't get more men

250
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:22,435
without help from
the Warden of the North.

251
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,502
Apologies, my lady.

252
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:57,804
<i>( door closes )</i>

253
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,224
Lord Commander.

254
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,726
How can I help you?

255
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,853
<i>Come with us</i>
<i>when we ride south.</i>

256
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:09,065
None of us
know the castle
as well as you do.

257
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,609
Its hidden tunnels,
its weaknesses,

258
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:14,237
its people.

259
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,865
Winterfell
was your home once.

260
00:19:17,949 --> 00:19:20,868
Don't you want
to chase the rats
out of it?

261
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,498
Castle Black
is my home now.

262
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:29,168
<i>The Night's Watch</i>
<i>take no part in the wars</i>
<i>of the Seven Kingdoms.</i>

263
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:31,420
There's only one war.

264
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:35,258
Life against death.

265
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:38,553
Come, let me show you
what you're fighting for.

266
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:41,472
You're gonna show me
some vision in the fire?

267
00:19:41,556 --> 00:19:46,102
Forgive me, my lady,
I don't trust in visions.

268
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:49,856
No visions.
No magic.

269
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:51,816
Just life.

270
00:20:11,586 --> 00:20:14,297
Do you feel
my heart beating?

271
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,634
There's power in you.

272
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:21,596
You resist it,
and that's your mistake.

273
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,931
Embrace it.

274
00:20:33,274 --> 00:20:36,611
The Lord of Light
made us male and female.

275
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:39,822
Two parts
of a greater whole.

276
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:44,702
In our joining,
there's power.

277
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:47,246
Power to make life,

278
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:49,665
power to make light,

279
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:52,585
and power
to cast shadows.

280
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:56,505
I don't think Stannis
would like that very much.

281
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:58,925
Then we shouldn't
tell him.

282
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:03,387
- I can't.
- Why?

283
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:05,806
I swore a vow.

284
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,477
I loved another.

285
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,854
The dead
don't need lovers.

286
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:14,065
Only the living.

287
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:21,447
I know.

288
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,449
But I still love her.

289
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:40,466
You know nothing,
Jon Snow.

290
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:56,065
<i>( knocks on door )</i>

291
00:22:17,962 --> 00:22:19,255
Are you lonely?

292
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:22,216
Just bored.

293
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,135
My father used
to tell me that boredom

294
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:25,720
indicates a lack
of inner resources.

295
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:27,471
Were you bored
a lot, too?

296
00:22:27,555 --> 00:22:29,974
I know
Castle Black

297
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:31,600
is no place
for a child, but--

298
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:35,104
I like it.
I thought I'd be
left at home.

299
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,857
I know Mother
didn't want to bring me.

300
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,985
Why do you say that?

301
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:43,571
She told me,
"I don't want
to bring you."

302
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:47,074
She shouldn't
have said that.

303
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:59,128
Are you ashamed
of me, Father?

304
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:13,142
When you were an infant,

305
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:16,645
a Dornish trader
landed on Dragonstone.

306
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:21,150
His goods were junk
except for one wooden doll.

307
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:24,945
He had even sewn a dress
on it in the colors
of our house.

308
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:29,116
No doubt he had
heard of your birth

309
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,495
and assumed new fathers
were easy targets.

310
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:39,126
I still remember
how you smiled when I put
that doll in your cradle.

311
00:23:40,461 --> 00:23:43,130
How you pressed it
to your cheek.

312
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:52,431
By the time
we burned the doll,
it was too late.

313
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:57,520
I was told you would die.

314
00:23:57,603 --> 00:24:00,648
Or worse,

315
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:02,441
the greyscale
would go slow.

316
00:24:02,525 --> 00:24:05,528
<i>Let you grow just enough</i>
<i>to know the world</i>

317
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:07,738
<i>before taking it</i>
<i>away from you.</i>

318
00:24:07,822 --> 00:24:10,366
Everyone advised me to send
you to the ruins of Valyria

319
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,535
to live out your short life
with the Stone Men

320
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:15,913
<i>before the sickness</i>
<i>spread through the castle.</i>

321
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:21,001
I told them all
to go to hell.

322
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:23,963
<i>I called in every maester</i>
<i>on this side of the world.</i>

323
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:27,591
Every healer.
Every apothecary.

324
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:32,805
They stopped the disease
and saved your life.

325
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:34,557
'Cause you did not belong
across the world

326
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,434
with the bloody Stone Men.

327
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:40,312
You are
the Princess Shireen
of House Baratheon.

328
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:45,025
And you are my daughter.

329
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:04,253
<i>( water dripping )</i>

330
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:48,631
Littlefinger:
<i>I thought I might</i>
<i>find you here.</i>

331
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:53,052
<i>Your Aunt Lyanna.</i>

332
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:57,056
Father never
talked about her.

333
00:25:57,139 --> 00:26:00,684
Sometimes I'd find him
down here lighting
the candles.

334
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,646
They say
she was beautiful.

335
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:05,606
I saw her once.

336
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:08,984
I was a boy living
with your mother's family.

337
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:12,905
Lord Whent held
a great tourney
at Harrenhal.

338
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:14,990
Everyone was there.

339
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:18,327
The Mad King,
your father,

340
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,037
Robert Baratheon,

341
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,830
and Lyanna.

342
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:24,833
She was already
promised to Robert.

343
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:26,460
You can imagine
what it was like for me,

344
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:30,214
a boy from nowhere
with nothing to his name,

345
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:32,007
watching these
legendary men

346
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:34,843
tilting
at the lists.

347
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:37,888
The last two riders
were Barristan Selmy

348
00:26:37,972 --> 00:26:39,765
and Rhaegar Targaryen.

349
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:43,435
When Rhaegar won,
everyone cheered
for their prince.

350
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:45,688
I remember the girls
laughing when he took
off his helmet

351
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:47,856
and they saw
that silver hair.

352
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,109
How handsome he was.

353
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:53,070
Until he rode
right past his wife,

354
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:55,072
Elia Martell,

355
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:56,907
and all the smiles died.

356
00:26:58,242 --> 00:27:01,704
I've never seen
so many people so quiet.

357
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:05,124
He rode past his wife

358
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:09,128
and he lay a crown
of winter roses
in Lyanna's lap.

359
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:11,588
Blue as frost.

360
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:16,593
How many
tens of thousands
had to die

361
00:27:16,677 --> 00:27:18,887
because Rhaegar
chose your aunt?

362
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:23,976
Yes, he chose her.

363
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:26,895
And then
he kidnapped her
and raped her.

364
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:36,572
Come.

365
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:39,283
Let's speak somewhere
the dead can't hear us.

366
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:45,914
You're dressed
for riding.

367
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:48,625
I am.

368
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:50,502
Where are you going?

369
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:52,588
King's Landing.

370
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:54,757
King's Landing?

371
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,258
Cersei sent for me.

372
00:27:56,342 --> 00:27:58,886
We mustn't let her
sniff out any trouble.

373
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:00,637
You can't leave me here.

374
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:03,182
I know how hard
it is to live with
people you despise.

375
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:04,933
Believe me.

376
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:06,852
But it won't be for long.

377
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:08,145
How do you know?

378
00:28:09,772 --> 00:28:13,192
Stannis Baratheon
garrisons at Castle Black.

379
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:15,277
He'll march south
to King's Landing

380
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:17,321
before the winter snows
block his way.

381
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:20,616
But first he has
to take Winterfell.

382
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:23,619
- You don't know that.
- I do.

383
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:26,163
Once he liberates
these lands from
the Boltons,

384
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:28,749
he'll rally your father's
bannermen to his cause.

385
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:30,667
With the North behind him,

386
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:33,379
Stannis can finally take
the Iron Throne.

387
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:36,340
You think he'll
defeat the Boltons?

388
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:37,925
He has a larger army.

389
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:40,219
He's the finest military
commander in Westeros.

390
00:28:40,302 --> 00:28:44,139
A betting man would put
his money on Stannis.

391
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:46,934
As it happens,
I am a betting man.

392
00:28:48,102 --> 00:28:49,895
And if you're right?

393
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,897
Stannis takes Winterfell,

394
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,942
he rescues you from
the most despised family
in the North.

395
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:58,237
Grateful for your
late father's courageous
support of his claim,

396
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,864
he names you
Wardeness of the North.

397
00:29:00,948 --> 00:29:03,158
But I--

398
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:04,868
I wouldn't--

399
00:29:04,952 --> 00:29:06,370
Wardeness of the North?

400
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:09,331
You are the last
surviving Stark.

401
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:11,166
He needs you.

402
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,459
And what if you're wrong?

403
00:29:12,543 --> 00:29:14,169
What if Stannis never
attacks Winterfell?

404
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:16,755
Or he does
and the Boltons
defeat him?

405
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:19,007
Then you will take
this Bolton boy, Ramsay,

406
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:20,843
and make him yours.

407
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:22,719
I don't know
how to do that.

408
00:29:22,803 --> 00:29:24,471
Of course you do.

409
00:29:24,555 --> 00:29:26,390
He's already
fallen for you.

410
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:28,350
His father frightens me.

411
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:31,687
He should.
He's a dangerous man.

412
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:35,524
But even the most dangerous
men can be outmaneuvered.

413
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,277
And you've learned
to maneuver from
the very best.

414
00:29:40,654 --> 00:29:43,198
I'll return
before too long.

415
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:46,034
You'll be strong
without me.

416
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:55,878
The North will be yours.

417
00:29:57,171 --> 00:29:59,256
Do you believe me?

418
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:05,345
I expect
I'll be a married woman
by the time you return.

419
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,599
( pats )

420
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:46,345
( groans )

421
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:48,847
( panting )

422
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:03,862
<i>( blade scraping )</i>

423
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:10,661
Breakfast.

424
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,791
That would have been
a shit way to die.

425
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:18,919
As far as I've seen,
they're all shit
ways to die.

426
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:22,506
Aye, but your lot have
to give the singers
a good ending.

427
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:25,133
I don't care
what's sung about me
when I'm dead.

428
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:27,135
No?

429
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:29,805
Two knights off
to rescue a princess.

430
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,682
Sounds like
a good song to me.

431
00:31:31,765 --> 00:31:33,350
Sounds like
all the rest.

432
00:31:36,937 --> 00:31:38,730
What about you?

433
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:42,276
What shit way
would you choose?

434
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:45,571
In my own keep
drinking my own wine

435
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:47,823
watching my sons
grovel for my fortune.

436
00:31:48,949 --> 00:31:51,326
How disappointing.

437
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:54,621
I thought
you'd have something
more exciting planned.

438
00:31:54,705 --> 00:31:56,832
I've had
an exciting life.

439
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:59,084
I want my death
to be boring.

440
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,504
How do you
want to go?

441
00:32:02,588 --> 00:32:05,007
In the arms
of the woman I love.

442
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:09,803
She want the same thing?

443
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:17,477
Let's go.

444
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:29,406
The captain of that ship--

445
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:31,033
what was he, Braavosi?

446
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:32,743
Pentoshi.

447
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:34,453
And he's headed
to Oldtown?

448
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:36,371
As I said.
Why?

449
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:39,166
What's to stop him from
docking down the coast

450
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:41,877
and telling the locals
that Jaime Lannister
is in Dorne?

451
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,879
A bag of gold.

452
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,756
I'm not sure
you understand

453
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:48,425
how much people hate
your family in this
part of the world.

454
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:50,052
It was a heavy bag.

455
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:53,180
And I bet he swore all
kinds of oaths to get it.

456
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:55,265
But you won't be around
if he breaks 'em.

457
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:57,934
-<i> ( horse neighs )</i>
-<i> ( hoofbeats )</i>

458
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,652
Bronn:
<i>How many you count?</i>

459
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:07,986
Four.

460
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:09,738
How many do you think
you can take?

461
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,907
One if he's slow.

462
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,412
Halt!

463
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:19,289
Over the hill.

464
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:23,919
Fucked in the ass.

465
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:29,007
Hyah!

466
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,389
Morning, lads.

467
00:33:35,472 --> 00:33:37,474
Glad we found you.

468
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:38,892
Who are you?

469
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:40,852
Cooper.

470
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:42,604
This is Darnell.

471
00:33:42,688 --> 00:33:44,314
You're from
King's Landing.

472
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:47,484
Accent gave me away?

473
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:49,861
Flea Bottom,
whelped and whipped.

474
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:51,154
Why are you here?

475
00:33:51,238 --> 00:33:53,240
Our ship capsized
in the night.

476
00:33:53,323 --> 00:33:54,866
We managed
to swim ashore.

477
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:57,786
It was a near
thing, really.

478
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:00,163
Thought the sharks
would get us.

479
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:04,209
There are no sharks
in Dorne.

480
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:07,921
Could have sworn
those were shark fins.

481
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:10,465
Dolphins, maybe.

482
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:12,843
Throw your swords
in the sand.

483
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:15,303
Boys, there's
no need for this.

484
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:18,306
Just point us
in the right direction,

485
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:19,850
we'll find our way home.

486
00:34:19,933 --> 00:34:22,269
Swords in the sand now.

487
00:34:32,738 --> 00:34:33,989
( grunts )

488
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:44,708
Hyah! Hyah!

489
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:48,128
( horse neighs )

490
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:52,132
That one should
be slow enough.

491
00:34:57,763 --> 00:34:59,431
( shouts )

492
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:32,130
( shouts )

493
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:43,934
( grunts )

494
00:35:45,769 --> 00:35:47,521
Bronn:
<i>Nice move.</i>

495
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:51,066
Luck.

496
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:53,318
You had
a wonderful teacher.

497
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:09,835
Always wanted
a Dornish stallion.

498
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:13,505
Beasts can run
a day and night
without tiring.

499
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,090
We'll ride
to the Water Gardens

500
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,508
with a nice breeze
in our faces.

501
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:19,386
First we need
to bury these bodies.

502
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:20,929
Birds have
to eat, too.

503
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,223
Corpses raise questions.
Questions raise armies.

504
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:25,725
We're not here
to start a war.

505
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:28,603
Do you know how long
it'll take us to dig
all those holes?

506
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:31,940
I can't dig very well
with one hand.

507
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:34,317
Not at all, really.

508
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:06,725
Mama.

509
00:37:12,272 --> 00:37:13,732
Nym, Obara.

510
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:15,567
Will it be war?

511
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:18,320
Prince Doran will weep
for your father,
but nothing else.

512
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:20,655
We must avenge
Oberyn ourselves.

513
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:23,992
Without Doran,
we have no army to march
against the Lannisters.

514
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:26,828
We don't need an army
to start a war.

515
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:30,665
<i>Queen Cersei loves</i>
<i>her children.</i>

516
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:32,584
And we have one of them.

517
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:34,544
You may have a problem.

518
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:40,967
( groaning )

519
00:37:41,051 --> 00:37:42,969
A ship's captain
who found me in
Planky Town

520
00:37:43,053 --> 00:37:44,679
claiming he had
information to sell.

521
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:48,725
He told me he smuggled
Jaime Lannister into Dorne.

522
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:53,021
He's come for Myrcella.

523
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:55,065
If he gets to her
before we do,

524
00:37:55,148 --> 00:37:57,984
we lose our only chance
for revenge.

525
00:37:58,068 --> 00:38:01,279
You must choose.

526
00:38:01,363 --> 00:38:03,031
Doran's way and peace,

527
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:06,493
or my way and war.

528
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:11,915
I'm with you always.

529
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:13,959
Nym?

530
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:19,881
Obara?

531
00:38:19,965 --> 00:38:23,927
When I was a child,
Oberyn came to take
me to court.

532
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,553
I had never seen
this man,

533
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:28,098
and yet he called
himself my father.

534
00:38:28,181 --> 00:38:29,557
My mother wept,

535
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:32,769
said I was too young
and a girl.

536
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:38,316
Oberyn tossed his spear
at my feet and said,

537
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,236
"Girl or boy,
we fight our battles,

538
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:44,572
but the gods let us
choose our weapons."

539
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:47,283
My father pointed
to the spear

540
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:49,244
and then
to my mother's tears.

541
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,415
( grunts )

542
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:59,254
I made my choice
long ago.

543
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:04,551
( Tyrion muffled )
Will you untie me?

544
00:39:04,634 --> 00:39:07,595
<i>( muffled )</i>
<i>Will you please untie me?</i>

545
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:09,764
( muffled groan )
Will you please?

546
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:16,771
( muffled singing )

547
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:34,539
Thank you.

548
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:44,674
Who are you?

549
00:39:44,758 --> 00:39:46,217
Your captor.

550
00:39:48,261 --> 00:39:49,929
Do you have wine?

551
00:39:50,013 --> 00:39:51,848
<i>No.</i>

552
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:53,850
Can't sleep
without wine.

553
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:55,894
Then stay awake.

554
00:40:01,608 --> 00:40:03,443
You're going
the wrong way.

555
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:07,155
My sister
is in Westeros.

556
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:09,991
Westeros is west.

557
00:40:10,075 --> 00:40:11,701
We're heading east.

558
00:40:11,785 --> 00:40:15,163
<i>I'm not taking you</i>
<i>to your sister.</i>

559
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,749
You said you were
taking me to the queen.

560
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:20,919
I am.
Queen Daenerys Targaryen.

561
00:40:21,002 --> 00:40:22,796
She's the queen I serve.

562
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:25,465
( laughing )

563
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:32,680
What a waste
of a good kidnapping.

564
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:34,682
It so happens
I was heading
there myself.

565
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:37,310
What business would you
have with the queen?

566
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:40,897
Gold and glory.
Oh, and hate.

567
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:44,400
If you'd ever met my sister,
you'd understand.

568
00:40:44,484 --> 00:40:48,863
So, now that it's clear
we are on the same side...

569
00:40:57,622 --> 00:41:01,584
<i>A highborn knight</i>
<i>from the North</i>
<i>of Westeros</i>

570
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:04,045
down on his luck
in Essos.

571
00:41:04,129 --> 00:41:08,341
Dragon epaulets,
bear sigil breastplate.

572
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:11,678
You're Jorah Mormont.

573
00:41:11,761 --> 00:41:14,389
<i>I have to ask.</i>

574
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:16,474
How exactly were you
serving your queen

575
00:41:16,558 --> 00:41:19,435
in a whorehouse
half a world away?

576
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:22,063
Is it possible
that you were running?

577
00:41:22,147 --> 00:41:24,732
Why would you be running?

578
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:26,985
And why would she
have sent you away?

579
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:30,071
Oh, wait.

580
00:41:30,155 --> 00:41:33,158
You were spying
on her, weren't you?

581
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:34,993
<i>It's all coming</i>
<i>back to me.</i>

582
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:37,579
I was drunk through
most of the small
council meetings,

583
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:39,247
but it's all coming back.

584
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:43,168
You passed notes
to Varys's little birds.

585
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:46,504
<i>She found out,</i>
<i>didn't she?</i>

586
00:41:46,588 --> 00:41:49,841
<i>Found out and exiled you.</i>

587
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:54,762
Now you hope to win back
her favor with a gift.

588
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:56,931
Risky scheme.

589
00:41:57,015 --> 00:42:00,894
<i>One might</i>
<i>even say desperate.</i>

590
00:42:00,977 --> 00:42:05,607
You think Daenerys
will execute me
and pardon you?

591
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:08,610
I'd say the reverse
is just as likely.

592
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:29,631
<i>( bird screeches )</i>

593
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:32,508
Everyone looks happy
enough from up here.

594
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:36,262
- ( laughs )
- What?

595
00:42:36,346 --> 00:42:38,181
I was thinking about
all the times your brother

596
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:40,391
made me go with him
down from the Red Keep

597
00:42:40,475 --> 00:42:42,018
into the streets
of King's Landing.

598
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:44,896
- Why?
- He liked to walk
among the people.

599
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:46,606
He liked to sing to them.

600
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:48,524
He sang to them?

601
00:42:48,608 --> 00:42:50,735
- Yes.
- ( laughs )

602
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:52,987
Rhaegar would pick
a spot on the Hook

603
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:56,157
or the Street of Seeds
and then he'd sing.

604
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:57,784
Just like all
the other minstrels.

605
00:42:57,867 --> 00:42:58,993
And what did you do?

606
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:00,703
I made sure
no one killed him.

607
00:43:00,787 --> 00:43:03,623
And I collected
the money.

608
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:06,167
What? He liked to see
how much he could make.

609
00:43:06,251 --> 00:43:08,253
- He was good?
- He was very good.

610
00:43:08,336 --> 00:43:09,837
Viserys never told you?

611
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:13,091
He told me Rhaegar
was good at killing people.

612
00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:14,842
Rhaegar never
liked killing.

613
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:16,135
He loved singing.

614
00:43:16,219 --> 00:43:18,179
And what did you do
with the money?

615
00:43:18,263 --> 00:43:21,224
Well, one time,
he gave it to the next
minstrel down the street.

616
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:23,935
One time, he gave it
to an orphanage
in Flea Bottom.

617
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:27,855
One time, we got
horribly drunk.

618
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:29,649
( laughs )

619
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:31,734
Your Grace.

620
00:43:31,818 --> 00:43:35,655
Hizdahr is here, waiting
in the audience chamber.

621
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:37,448
How many others
are there?

622
00:43:37,532 --> 00:43:40,368
50? 100?

623
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:42,203
Will you be joining us,
Ser Barristan?

624
00:43:42,287 --> 00:43:46,040
I think I can protect you
from Hizdahr zo Loraq.

625
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:49,711
I think I can protect me
from Hizdahr zo Loraq.

626
00:43:49,794 --> 00:43:51,379
Go, Ser Barristan.

627
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:52,839
Sing a song for me.

628
00:43:52,922 --> 00:43:55,133
Your Grace.

629
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:03,433
All men must die,
but not all can die
in glory.

630
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:05,601
- Glory?
- Why else do men fight?

631
00:44:05,685 --> 00:44:07,895
Why did your ancestors
cross the Narrow Sea

632
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:09,480
and conquer
the Seven Kingdoms?

633
00:44:09,564 --> 00:44:11,899
So their names
would live on.

634
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:13,651
Those who find victory
in the fighting pits

635
00:44:13,735 --> 00:44:17,071
will never become kings,
but their names will live on.

636
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:18,990
It's the best chance
they'll ever have.

637
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:20,742
Is that what
you used to tell men

638
00:44:20,825 --> 00:44:23,161
before you set them
to butchering each other
for sport?

639
00:44:23,244 --> 00:44:26,372
Your Grace, today
is the traditional start
of the fighting season.

640
00:44:26,456 --> 00:44:28,124
I do not recognize
this tradition.

641
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:31,586
Traditions are the only thing
that will hold this city,

642
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:33,046
your city, together.

643
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:36,924
Without them,
former slaves
and former masters

644
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:39,761
have nothing
in common.

645
00:44:39,844 --> 00:44:44,974
Nothing but centuries
of mistrust and resentment.

646
00:44:45,058 --> 00:44:48,770
<i>I can't promise</i>
<i>this is the answer</i>
<i>to all our problems,</i>

647
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:51,105
but it's a start.

648
00:44:57,987 --> 00:44:59,614
( laughing )

649
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:03,868
( gurgling )

650
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:06,662
- ( grunts )
- ( people shouting )

651
00:45:16,089 --> 00:45:19,050
( people shouting )

652
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:26,933
( crying )

653
00:45:27,016 --> 00:45:29,185
( speaking Valyrian )

654
00:45:57,130 --> 00:45:58,881
( shouting )

655
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:24,282
( shouts )

656
00:46:34,375 --> 00:46:35,835
( groans )

657
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:44,135
<i>( alarm bell ringing )</i>

658
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:46,471
<i>( men shouting )</i>

659
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,322
( screams )

660
00:47:14,582 --> 00:47:16,501
( groans )

661
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:46,113
( panting )

662
00:47:46,197 --> 00:47:48,449
<i>( man shouts )</i>

663
00:47:48,533 --> 00:47:50,743
( grunts )

664
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:22,483
( grunts )

665
00:48:35,496 --> 00:48:37,248
( screams )

666
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:42,044
( grunts )

667
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:56,851
<i>( alarm bell</i>
<i>continues ringing )</i>

668
00:49:06,277 --> 00:50:25,022
<i>( music playing )</i>
