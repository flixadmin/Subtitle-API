1
00:00:22,416 --> 00:00:26,875
FOR LOVING ME, BEARING ME, FORGIVING ME

2
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:57,083
Dear students…

3
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:59,958
on this event of
World Science Day celebrations,

4
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:03,458
may we cordially invite the
most knowledgeable professor

5
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:07,208
and a very popular atheist,
Dr. Lenin Satyam.

6
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:12,541
And may I now request him
to please say a few words.

7
00:01:14,958 --> 00:01:15,791
Hi.

8
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:17,541
Thank you.

9
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:21,375
Faculty members and my dear students…

10
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:25,083
we seek an auspicious time
when we enter our new home.

11
00:01:26,791 --> 00:01:29,375
We look for an auspicious moment
to step outside our homes.

12
00:01:30,375 --> 00:01:32,833
We choose an auspicious time
of marriage or even death.

13
00:01:34,166 --> 00:01:38,125
We seek a good time even
for sending rockets into space.

14
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:41,125
And the worst part is that…

15
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:46,458
some doctors deliver the child by
cutting the womb at the auspicious time.

16
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:47,833
Can you believe this?

17
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:50,208
Is it science or dogma?

18
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:52,291
Is this all science?

19
00:01:53,541 --> 00:01:56,583
We put lemons in the pockets
of a student appearing for exams.

20
00:01:57,458 --> 00:01:59,500
And tie talismans around
the neck when he gets a fever.

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,500
From dawn to dusk, our world
revolves around astrology,

22
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:05,333
horoscopes, discourses,
and reincarnation theories.

23
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:10,083
Believe in science,
and search for the truth.

24
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:15,125
As an atheist, as a professor who
believes in science I am telling you,

25
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:18,041
if faith is suppressing the truth,

26
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:21,291
that faith is buried by blind faith.

27
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,541
Rachalakshmi!

28
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,666
Don't do it.

29
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:20,541
Praise the Lord.

30
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:26,125
Take blessings.

31
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:27,416
Won't you listen to me?

32
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,000
What if Dad learns about it?

33
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:33,833
You will directly go to
hell if you don't bother

34
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:35,625
about God and the devil, good and evil.

35
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,750
Mom, we are atheists.
It doesn't affect us.

36
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:40,583
It doesn't bother you but it bothers me.

37
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:45,125
You went to study in London and
came back with this white-skinned girl.

38
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:47,708
She knows zilch about
our customs and traditions.

39
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:51,000
Rajalakshmi! I have
such a beautiful name.

40
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:53,500
She mispronounces that as well.

41
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:55,541
- Yes, Rachalakshmi!
- Hey.

42
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:57,041
Come here, you white man!

43
00:03:57,916 --> 00:03:59,375
Do you know what he did yesterday?

44
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:01,750
I sent him to buy lemons.

45
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:03,750
He brought the ones used on the road.

46
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:06,708
I used it to make <i>puliogare</i>.

47
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:13,750
I kept fearing day and night
the consequences of my actions.

48
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,875
You thief!

49
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:16,625
Why do I deserve this?

50
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:18,708
It's not your fault but mine.

51
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:20,750
- Grandpa…
- What?

52
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:22,375
See, what she is doing.

53
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:26,208
You…

54
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:34,625
Here I spread the word that there's
no God and you keep visiting temples.

55
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:38,958
What will happen to me
if someone spots you here?

56
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:40,916
Don't worry about that.

57
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,916
I wear a double mask
so that no one sees me.

58
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,291
- I will kill you.
- Dad.

59
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:46,541
Mom.

60
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:47,833
Dad, please sit down.

61
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:49,875
What is it, Mom?

62
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,958
- Interview?
- I am leaving.

63
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:54,708
- All the best.
- Thanks, Dad.

64
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:56,291
Why don't you join a software company?

65
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:57,625
Why are you taking up a government job?

66
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:58,916
Because it's a government job.

67
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:00,875
Bye, Mom.

68
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:02,625
Bye.

69
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:06,208
Viplav Devarakonda!

70
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:10,208
{\an8}May I come in, ma'am?

71
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:19,041
{\an8}You are very lucky.

72
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:22,250
{\an8}You're the only one to get
selected as J.T.O. in Hyderabad.

73
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,375
{\an8}- How am I lucky?
- Others…

74
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:27,125
{\an8}I am bored with Hyderabad.

75
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:28,541
{\an8}It's the same hi-tech
city, the same tank bund,

76
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,041
{\an8}the same <i>biryani</i>, and the Charminar.

77
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,708
{\an8}Please select something
more exotic, ma'am.

78
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:39,708
{\an8}Do you think it's a government office
or a tourism company?

79
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,833
{\an8}No! Please don't misunderstand me, ma'am.

80
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:45,291
{\an8}I am still young and haven't seen enough.

81
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:51,083
{\an8}- Raju…
- <i>Ma'am.</i>

82
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:53,958
{\an8}- Send that new bridegroom in.
- <i>Okay, ma'am.</i>

83
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:58,375
{\an8}Excuse me, ma'am.

84
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,583
{\an8}He's newly married and
got posted in Kashmir.

85
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:08,791
{\an8}- If you both agree mutually…
- I'll gladly go to Kashmir.

86
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:10,375
{\an8}I am fine with it.

87
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:11,666
{\an8}Thank you, sir.

88
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:14,208
{\an8}- You can leave.
- Okay, ma'am.

89
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:20,125
{\an8}Why are you laughing?

90
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:21,708
{\an8}Is he a fool, ma'am?

91
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:26,291
{\an8}He wants to stay here instead of enjoying
government hospitality in Kashmir!

92
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:29,750
Do you think you can afford to
live there with this kind of salary?

93
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:32,916
{\an8}It's not about if I can afford it or not
but all about the experience, ma'am.

94
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,916
The experience of listening
to A. R. Rahman's music,

95
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,833
plucking fresh apples…

96
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,708
in snowy surroundings…

97
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:47,625
I want to call you and
share the experience

98
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,750
and see how happy or jealous you feel.

99
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,458
Forget about my feelings.

100
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:53,500
I hope you are clear.

101
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:54,583
I am clear about it, ma'am.

102
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:57,333
{\an8}- I am approving it.
- Go ahead, ma'am.

103
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:17,708
I told you, Rabdi.

104
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:21,625
A Telugu officer is coming here
where no one chooses to come.

105
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,250
- <i>Really?</i>
- Yes.

106
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:25,916
If he doesn't come then they
will close the exchange here…

107
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:28,750
and then I can be back in Kolkata.

108
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:31,666
Rabdi, the train is here. Stay on call.

109
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:35,166
I can't see him.

110
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:38,125
I can't see him.

111
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:41,083
He is not here!

112
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:46,375
Didn't I tell you?
He didn't come.

113
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:47,875
I will come to Kolkata.

114
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:50,166
What will we have when
we reach Howrah Bridge?

115
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:52,000
We will have <i>rasgulla</i>.

116
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:55,166
- What shall we eat?
- We'll eat apples.

117
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:59,041
Rabdi, here he is.

118
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:02,500
You can have <i>rasgulla</i>
and I will again have apple.

119
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:03,833
Pitobash?

120
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:06,291
I couldn't notice you, sir.

121
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:10,708
I took the seat next to
the driver for a better view.

122
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:12,166
Really? You did that?

123
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,208
Oh God!

124
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:14,333
Please come.

125
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:17,208
- Pitobash!
- Sir!

126
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:18,375
You speak good Telugu.

127
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:19,958
I studied in Puttaparthi
until class tenth.

128
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:20,958
- Praise the Lord.
- Oh!

129
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:22,750
How far is the exchange from here?

130
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:24,625
We'll reach by evening.

131
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:27,291
No problem. Go slowly.

132
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:28,791
This is the maximum speed, sir.

133
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:40,875
Kashmir is so beautiful!

134
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:44,750
Looks just like a frame
out of the film <i>Roja</i>.

135
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:48,708
It's the same snow! The same feel!

136
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:51,125
Just Madhubala is amiss.

137
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,333
Wow!

138
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:54,458
I swear in the name
of Arvind Swamy, Pito…

139
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:58,208
I am madly in love with Kashmir!

140
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:00,625
Oh, sir! Oh God!

141
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:02,916
Sir, please take it out.

142
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:05,541
Be careful, sir.

143
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,625
Hey, R.K., look how beautiful Kashmir is!

144
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:10,416
It's so beautiful.

145
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:15,083
Stop the vehicle by the
side and have two pegs.

146
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:16,041
You will get a terrific feel.

147
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:17,000
I must have it!

148
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:18,958
If we slip here, even our
bodies won't be recovered.

149
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:20,916
- Hey, Viplav.
- Hello? R.K.?

150
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:22,541
To heck with the signal!

151
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:24,125
Hey, lift it.

152
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,000
This land…

153
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:38,583
the hills…

154
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:42,125
and the pure breeze here…

155
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:04,541
Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.

156
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,625
Praise the Lord.
Praise the Lord.

157
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,166
Praise the Lord.
Praise the Lord.

158
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:22,583
What's happening, Pitobash?

159
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:27,500
A war just broke out, sir!
Don't you get it?

160
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:29,166
Pakistan is on the
other side of this hill.

161
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:31,291
Really?

162
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:33,500
Yes, of course.

163
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:35,833
It's a bloody war going on!

164
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:38,666
Both sides keep hurling
bombs at each other, sir.

165
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,291
What do you mean, Pitobash?

166
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,500
Why did you come here, sir?

167
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:45,916
Who will take care of my Rabdi
if something happens to me?

168
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:47,958
Rabdi!

169
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:49,500
Oh, Lord!

170
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,708
Hey, who are you?
What are you doing here?

171
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:55,208
Sir, we are BSNL employees.
J.T.O, Kashmir posting, sir.

172
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:56,208
Why Kashmir?

173
00:10:56,291 --> 00:11:01,000
Sir, the location is beautiful here.
I've come to enjoy the scenery here.

174
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:01,958
What?

175
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:03,625
I've come to enjoy here, sir.

176
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:05,083
Enjoy?

177
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,000
We are risking our lives
for protecting the country

178
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,833
- and you have come here for enjoyment.
- Tell him that, sir.

179
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:11,750
- Just get out of here. Quick.
- Go! Go!

180
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:14,375
- Leave!
- Hail Mother India!

181
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,416
Hail Mother India!

182
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,041
This is our exchange office, sir.

183
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:39,166
Do we have to climb up
till there, Pitobash?

184
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:41,125
Or else, sleep in the car.
I will wake you up in the morning.

185
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:43,375
Sorry, sir.

186
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:44,583
Bring my luggage inside.

187
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:55,541
- Greetings, sir.
- Hi!

188
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,291
- Pitobash.
- What happened, sir?

189
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,458
The bathroom is stinking.

190
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:20,041
It's a government office.
That's how things will be, sir.

191
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:21,500
Why don't you go in the open?

192
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:25,458
What? Are you joking?

193
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:28,000
- Hey, get up.
- What?

194
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,333
I didn't mean that, Pito.

195
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:38,583
I can't pee in the open.

196
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:45,583
Let's find something more comfortable
nearby like a hotel or a restaurant.

197
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:46,666
Comfortable?

198
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:11,750
Hey, Pito! Your song
doesn't match the situation.

199
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,666
It's very distracting. Stop it.

200
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,375
You need a fag to freshen up.
I need a song to perk up.

201
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,000
You are my boss in
office and not over here.

202
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:19,875
The tribals will be here anytime soon.

203
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:22,250
They may even shoot us
mistaking us for polar bears.

204
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:24,375
Wrap it up fast.

205
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,916
My Rabdi loves this song.
Poor Rabdi.

206
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,375
Rabdi.

207
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:39,708
Hey!

208
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:41,750
What's that?

209
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:43,791
Why do you get agitated so fast?

210
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:57,541
Everyone's got their talent.

211
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,666
- I am hungry, Pitobash.
- So am I, sir.

212
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:01,916
Let's go.

213
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:04,041
Pito…

214
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:06,291
why are all the shops shut?

215
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:07,750
It's wartime, right?

216
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:09,125
So, there will be a curfew for a week.

217
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,791
- What next?
- There will be a war again.

218
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:14,208
What about our meal now?

219
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,791
We will have to beg for food. I
hope we find some kind people.

220
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:18,750
- Or else?
- They will abuse us.

221
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:20,166
- What are you staring at?
- Hello, sir.

222
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,250
It's curfew time. Just leave!

223
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:22,416
- Yes, we are moving.
- Move.

224
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,041
- We are going. <i>Jai Hind.</i>
- Move.

225
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,583
- Pito.
- Sir…

226
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,375
How do we ask in their language?

227
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:32,583
Ma'am, could you please
give me some food?

228
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:35,291
Ma'am, could you please
give me some food?

229
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,250
You have to beg for it
and not demand for it.

230
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:41,375
Ma'am, could you please
give me some food?

231
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:42,583
Okay. All the best.

232
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:45,916
Ma'am, could you please
give me some food?

233
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:52,125
Ma'am, could you please
give me some food?

234
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:58,625
Ma'am…

235
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,375
Ma'am, could you please
give me some food?

236
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,041
Hello…

237
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:22,041
Excuse me…

238
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:27,583
Ma'am, could you please
give me some food?

239
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:29,916
I don't want apple.

240
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,958
Stop, guys.

241
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:33,833
I don't want this!

242
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:38,708
Bloody apple!

243
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,833
Have this apple, man.

244
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:43,250
- I don't want.
- I don't want.

245
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:52,583
Ma'am, could you…
please give me some food?

246
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:55,750
Eat this.

247
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:58,625
Hey, do you think I am crazy?

248
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,500
Why is everyone giving me an apple

249
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,083
when I am asking in the
proper local language?

250
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,833
- Don't you have nothing else but apples?
- Really?

251
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:07,083
- Get some <i>idli</i> or <i>dosa</i>.
- Get out of here.

252
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,458
- Why are you shouting?
- What are you saying?

253
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:11,125
- Auntie, we came from Hyderabad.
- Get the hell out of here.

254
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:12,958
- Don't bark. Are you threatening me?
- I will show you who I am.

255
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:15,208
- Hey, stop there.
- What the heck are you talking about?

256
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:16,125
Hello, stop.

257
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,916
- I didn't say anything rude to you.
- Don't bake my brains in the morning.

258
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,500
Don't you dare come back here!

259
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:31,500
- Ma'am.
- Viplav, how are you?

260
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:32,875
Ma'am.

261
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:37,208
I came to the market to buy
apples at 250 rupees per kilogram.

262
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:38,916
<i>And that's when I thought of calling you.</i>

263
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:45,041
You must be plucking fresh
apples from the orchard there.

264
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:46,833
Ma'am, this is a different Kashmir.

265
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:49,875
There's biting cold on one side
and insatiable hunger on the other.

266
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:53,708
There's war and curfew everywhere
with nothing else but apple to eat.

267
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:56,083
I will come back to Hyderabad, ma'am.
Post me there.

268
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:57,875
How can I do that?

269
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:00,916
Oh, ma'am. We have to fend for
each other as BSNL employees, ma'am.

270
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,166
- <i>Viplav, what are you saying?</i>
- Ma'am, I know you can hear me.

271
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:05,291
I can't hear you, man.

272
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:07,916
Ma'am, don't disconnect!

273
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:09,375
Or else I will be doomed.

274
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:16,458
Ma'am!

275
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,166
- She's at work now.
- Okay.

276
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:22,708
Will you have an apple?

277
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:24,458
Thank you.

278
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:28,958
But they won't pay you money!

279
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:37,708
Stop singing, Pito.

280
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,333
Why, sir?

281
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:41,958
We should ruffle up Mani Ratnam
and A.R. Rahman.

282
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:42,958
Why, sir?

283
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:44,000
He took us for a ride.

284
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:48,333
But there's nothing herein
Kashmir except snow and apples!

285
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:51,875
Then why don't you leave, sir?
I will get some relief.

286
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:55,041
Ara… flowers

287
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,625
Brother, can we take those flowers?

288
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,125
Pito, it started again.

289
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:16,333
What?

290
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:18,291
Rahman's background score.

291
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:33,041
Don't stare at them. They are
local Muslims. They will kill us.

292
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:34,250
It's okay if we die.

293
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:36,041
- Deepu…
- Yes.

294
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,583
Someone's following us on that boat.

295
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:42,666
- Where?
- Look over there.

296
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,291
Look at how he is staring at us.

297
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:46,958
He is just gazing at us, dear.

298
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:50,250
He is ogling at us. Can't you see?

299
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:54,166
Give that paddle to me.

300
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:55,125
Why do you want it now, sir?

301
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:57,416
- Give it to me!
- Give that! Here you go.

302
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,458
He is speaking in Telugu.

303
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:00,125
You are always hasty.

304
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:01,416
- Hail the Lord.
- Ms. Ara!

305
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:03,208
Sir.

306
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:04,708
- I am coming.
- Not coming.

307
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:06,833
No, sir. Please.

308
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,416
Look at how he's breaking
the paddle and rushing to us.

309
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:12,583
He will get closer if he
figures out that we are Telugu.

310
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,958
Have you forgotten why we are here?

311
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:18,166
I will somehow avoid him. You stay quiet.

312
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:19,291
Okay.

313
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,583
Brother, go fast.

314
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,250
Fast. Fast.

315
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:23,208
- Hey, Pito!
- Sir…

316
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:25,500
- She's leaving. Push!
- The paddle is with you, sir.

317
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,208
- Why don't you push with your hands, Pito?
- What a torture!

318
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:30,666
What are you talking about, sir?

319
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,458
Such a beautiful Kashmir.

320
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:36,958
- Begum.
- No, sir!

321
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:39,041
- Listen to me.
- Pito.

322
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:41,625
- Oh God!
- Begum, please stop.

323
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:48,916
- Sir.
- What? Who are you?

324
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,083
- What do you want?
- Nothing.

325
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:52,625
- Can we speak to the Begum once?
- Please let them go, sir.

326
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:53,583
Which Begum?

327
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:55,583
Do you know where we are from?

328
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,041
I don't know about you.

329
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,333
But Begum is straight from heaven!

330
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:01,291
Sir!

331
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,041
We are from Pakistan.

332
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:07,125
Perish the lie!

333
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:11,291
We're here in search of her
brother, Feroze who is eight years old.

334
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:13,458
She's come all the way
from Pakistan to Kashmir

335
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:15,416
in search of her eight-year-old
brother, Feroze who's gone missing.

336
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:21,208
Her relatives are all training
in different terrorist camps.

337
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:22,916
It seems her kin are terrorists, sir.

338
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:27,583
- If you go after her…
- If you go after her…

339
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:30,208
- They will skin you alive.
- Oh my God.

340
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:31,875
It seems they will skin us alive!

341
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:33,708
- They will skin us alive!
- Let's go.

342
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:36,000
- Sir--
- Can I fall in love with you?

343
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:38,208
Can we do that?

344
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:39,166
Hey!

345
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:43,833
Sir, did you see the red
bag? She's a terrorist, sir.

346
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,208
Haven't you watched the film <i>Dil Se</i>?

347
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:47,250
You will be blown to bits.

348
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:48,916
So, what if they are
terrorists, Pitobash?

349
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:52,875
They are still humans and have feelings.

350
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:57,750
Feelings are unpredictable.

351
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:01,958
Here's my ID card.

352
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,791
It has my number.

353
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:07,625
- No.
- Keep it, Begum.

354
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:09,875
Think again.

355
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:12,000
Feel my love.

356
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:14,416
And do call me.

357
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:16,375
Yes, of course.

358
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:17,458
Let's go.

359
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:22,208
Am I his girlfriend or
classmate to call him?

360
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:25,500
No matter what place do we go to.

361
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:26,916
Men will always be men.

362
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:28,500
To hell with him. Ignore him.

363
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:46,083
<i>Joy is when I spot you</i>

364
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:51,541
<i>Joy is when I hear you</i>

365
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:18,000
<i>My sweetheart</i>
<i>She cast a spell full of warmth</i>

366
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:21,958
<i>She tantalizes me like a cute dream</i>

367
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:28,875
<i>Her eyes sparkle all over like moonshine</i>

368
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:32,958
<i>The anchor's gone</i>
<i>Here comes a tidal wave</i>

369
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:37,250
<i>You and I together.</i>

370
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,958
<i>You are my only love</i>

371
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:44,333
<i>The groundswell of love</i>
<i>Showering a rainbow of colors</i>

372
00:22:45,416 --> 00:22:50,500
<i>Joy is when I spot you</i>

373
00:22:50,791 --> 00:22:55,916
<i>Joy is when I hear you</i>

374
00:22:56,083 --> 00:23:00,208
<i>Joy is when we are together</i>

375
00:23:01,375 --> 00:23:05,000
<i>Joy is when my body is stirred</i>

376
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:41,125
<i>How I fell in love with you</i>
<i>Intoxicated by you!</i>

377
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:46,416
<i>Walking in the air in a trance of you</i>

378
00:23:46,791 --> 00:23:51,791
<i>Truth be told</i>
<i>You are my lover</i>

379
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:57,333
<i>And I swear</i>
<i>The rest of my life will only be with you</i>

380
00:23:57,541 --> 00:24:02,458
<i>The heartbeat goes on</i>
<i>Once it catches up with your breath</i>

381
00:24:02,791 --> 00:24:07,166
<i>A storm in my heart</i>
<i>The moment I feel your tender touch</i>

382
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:12,708
<i>My sweetheart</i>
<i>She cast a spell full of warmth</i>

383
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:16,750
<i>She tantalizes me like a cute dream</i>

384
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:21,375
<i>You and I together…</i>

385
00:24:21,458 --> 00:24:24,041
<i>You are my only love</i>

386
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:28,375
<i>The groundswell of love</i>
<i>Showering a rainbow of colors</i>

387
00:24:29,458 --> 00:24:34,125
<i>Joy is when I spot you</i>

388
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:39,916
<i>Joy is when I hear you</i>

389
00:24:40,166 --> 00:24:44,458
<i>Joy is when you and I are together</i>

390
00:24:45,458 --> 00:24:48,958
<i>Joy is when my body is stirred</i>

391
00:24:57,666 --> 00:25:01,208
Dear, did you change
Chintu's diapers and feed Bujji?

392
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,875
I haven't come here to relax.

393
00:25:04,958 --> 00:25:07,000
Look at how our HR is making us work.

394
00:25:07,416 --> 00:25:08,458
Good morning, ma'am.

395
00:25:08,916 --> 00:25:09,750
What is it?

396
00:25:09,958 --> 00:25:11,708
I told you on day one of your joining.

397
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,208
If you are working under me, forget
about your family and the world.

398
00:25:15,375 --> 00:25:17,625
The company planned it
for us to relax in Kashmir,

399
00:25:17,708 --> 00:25:19,541
but this fellow is making us work.

400
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,791
- Where is Aradhya?
- No idea, sir.

401
00:25:28,958 --> 00:25:30,625
- Sir…
- Where are you, Aradhya?

402
00:25:30,833 --> 00:25:31,666
<i>Sir, I mean.</i>

403
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,791
He is driving me mad
on client presentation.

404
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:38,000
Chatur sir…

405
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,333
Aara is embarking on a prayer
trip to Mamuleswar temple

406
00:25:40,458 --> 00:25:43,583
for relief to her
grandmother from knee pains.

407
00:25:44,083 --> 00:25:45,583
She is breaking
coconuts for Thanksgiving.

408
00:25:45,833 --> 00:25:48,708
Break them on my head.
Where are they now?

409
00:25:48,916 --> 00:25:50,958
The Anantnag road is blocked, sir.

410
00:25:51,166 --> 00:25:52,333
We are traveling via Pulwama now.

411
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,833
That place had a blast recently.

412
00:25:53,916 --> 00:25:55,708
If they figure out that you are
non-locals, they will kill you.

413
00:25:55,791 --> 00:25:56,750
What about my presentation?

414
00:25:56,833 --> 00:25:58,833
That's where we are wearing a burqa, sir.

415
00:25:59,083 --> 00:26:01,250
If Aradhya is not back in
the resort in the next hour,

416
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:03,125
I am going to fire you both
after reaching Hyderabad.

417
00:26:03,208 --> 00:26:04,708
- Hello!
- Brother…

418
00:26:04,791 --> 00:26:06,000
- Chatur sir.
- Sir.

419
00:26:06,083 --> 00:26:08,750
Need a vehicle to go
to Mamuleswar temple.

420
00:26:09,666 --> 00:26:10,875
- Mamuleswar?
- Yes.

421
00:26:11,166 --> 00:26:12,041
Will tonga be fine?

422
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:14,125
It's fine.

423
00:26:15,083 --> 00:26:15,916
Salim…

424
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:17,375
Yes, bro.

425
00:26:19,375 --> 00:26:20,250
Okay. Come over.

426
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:23,125
Please go.

427
00:26:26,541 --> 00:26:27,458
Brother…

428
00:26:28,416 --> 00:26:30,708
two girls are here who
are wearing a burqa.

429
00:26:31,166 --> 00:26:33,125
They are inquiring about the
way to Mamuleswar temple.

430
00:26:33,791 --> 00:26:36,333
She looks like an Indian
Officer on a secret mission, bro.

431
00:26:38,625 --> 00:26:40,125
Nobody shall leave this place!

432
00:26:40,541 --> 00:26:42,708
Sir… what must be in Begum's red bag?

433
00:26:43,208 --> 00:26:44,375
What else can it be, Pitobash?

434
00:26:45,166 --> 00:26:48,708
If a girl is holding onto the bag,

435
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:52,583
it must be lipstick
and other accessories.

436
00:26:53,666 --> 00:26:55,541
- That's all, right? Sure?
- Yes.

437
00:26:55,666 --> 00:26:56,500
Thank God.

438
00:26:56,583 --> 00:26:58,375
- I worried that it carried explosives.
- Pito…

439
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:02,166
Begum!

440
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:06,958
Brother, how much will it cost a trip?

441
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:08,125
6,500 rupees, ma'am.

442
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,833
Begum.

443
00:27:14,208 --> 00:27:15,958
Why are you here?

444
00:27:16,208 --> 00:27:21,708
- We… are…
- You're here for Feroze, right?

445
00:27:22,583 --> 00:27:25,958
- Yes, for Feroze.
- Yes, for Feroze.

446
00:27:27,875 --> 00:27:31,750
I know you're frantically
searching for Feroze.

447
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:32,958
Give me a chance.

448
00:27:34,041 --> 00:27:34,916
Let me also try.

449
00:27:35,333 --> 00:27:38,208
Instead of searching in this manner,

450
00:27:38,375 --> 00:27:40,958
I will announce for Feroze.

451
00:27:41,041 --> 00:27:43,666
- Announcement?
- No! No!

452
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:48,250
Begum.

453
00:27:50,333 --> 00:27:51,250
I am here for you.

454
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,875
Brothers and sisters…

455
00:27:59,083 --> 00:28:00,416
this is Aara begum.

456
00:28:02,416 --> 00:28:05,333
Her younger brother,
Feroze has gone missing.

457
00:28:06,416 --> 00:28:10,333
If anyone knows about his
whereabouts, please inform me.

458
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,041
Who is Feroze amongst you?

459
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:17,250
Come forward. Don't be shy.

460
00:28:17,375 --> 00:28:18,541
I am Feroze!

461
00:28:19,375 --> 00:28:20,416
I am Feroze!

462
00:28:22,416 --> 00:28:23,458
I am Feroze!

463
00:28:24,708 --> 00:28:25,791
I am Feroze!

464
00:28:25,958 --> 00:28:26,791
I am Feroze!

465
00:28:32,333 --> 00:28:33,875
- I am Feroze!
- I am Feroze!

466
00:28:35,958 --> 00:28:37,166
See brothers…

467
00:28:37,958 --> 00:28:40,833
all of you look like buffaloes.

468
00:28:42,291 --> 00:28:46,208
That boy Feroze is a cute,
young boy, like my Begum.

469
00:28:46,833 --> 00:28:48,333
Pitobhash, translate this.

470
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,875
Pito…

471
00:28:54,166 --> 00:28:56,250
Okay, tell me now. Who is Feroze?

472
00:28:56,333 --> 00:28:57,416
I am Feroze.

473
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:00,375
Kill him.

474
00:29:00,791 --> 00:29:03,750
Hey. Please stop guys.

475
00:29:04,291 --> 00:29:07,583
Why are you using
swords? Let's sit and talk.

476
00:29:08,916 --> 00:29:10,916
Begum, he is your man?

477
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:13,250
Please talk and sort it out.

478
00:29:24,916 --> 00:29:25,958
- Hey!
- Hey!

479
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:31,458
I will smash your heads, bloody fellows.

480
00:29:31,541 --> 00:29:34,250
I will break your heads,
I am warning you.

481
00:29:34,958 --> 00:29:36,416
Hail the Lord. I am Feroze!

482
00:29:37,666 --> 00:29:39,291
Begum, come with me.

483
00:29:42,583 --> 00:29:43,750
Hail the Lord.

484
00:29:45,125 --> 00:29:46,666
- Sir--
- Useless fellow!

485
00:29:47,458 --> 00:29:48,625
I am Feroze!

486
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,833
Pito.

487
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,041
Sir, come here. No, go
there! No, come here!

488
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,958
- No.
- Hey, get going!

489
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:17,583
Run!

490
00:30:37,333 --> 00:30:38,500
Begum, don't get scared.

491
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,166
I am used to these kinds
of chases in Hyderabad.

492
00:30:41,541 --> 00:30:42,416
We are safe.

493
00:30:49,708 --> 00:30:50,750
Hail the Lord!

494
00:31:03,416 --> 00:31:04,791
- Hold me, Begum.
- No.

495
00:31:04,875 --> 00:31:06,250
They will chop your head off, Begum!

496
00:32:31,875 --> 00:32:34,166
- What happened?
- Begum, two more to go.

497
00:32:34,541 --> 00:32:35,416
We will get rid of them too.

498
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,958
Sir…

499
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,416
Do not go into the water.

500
00:32:59,375 --> 00:33:01,375
If you want something, you
have to give up on something.

501
00:33:01,541 --> 00:33:03,041
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.

502
00:33:03,666 --> 00:33:05,375
Hail the Lord! Please come here.

503
00:33:16,125 --> 00:33:17,083
Pito!

504
00:33:20,625 --> 00:33:21,666
Hail Lord Mamuleshwara!

505
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:22,875
- We are saved!
- Begum…

506
00:33:26,166 --> 00:33:27,583
You are a Muslim.

507
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:31,166
Why are you visiting a temple?

508
00:33:32,083 --> 00:33:34,708
Ara can do anything for Feroze.

509
00:33:34,791 --> 00:33:37,000
She prays to every God.

510
00:33:37,333 --> 00:33:38,833
Aren't all Gods created equally?

511
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:40,291
Yes, all Gods are equal.

512
00:33:40,625 --> 00:33:41,625
- Yes, all are the same.
- All are the same.

513
00:33:42,333 --> 00:33:43,791
Yes, we'll go.

514
00:33:44,083 --> 00:33:45,500
Hey, stop.

515
00:33:46,125 --> 00:33:49,333
She wants to pray in solitude
inside. Can you wait here?

516
00:33:49,416 --> 00:33:52,375
- We will go inside. Okay?
- Okay, please carry on.

517
00:33:57,875 --> 00:33:59,000
- Pito…
- Sir…

518
00:34:00,166 --> 00:34:01,166
A Pakistani girl.

519
00:34:02,333 --> 00:34:04,458
Look how broad-minded she is!

520
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,916
My family will love her.

521
00:34:08,041 --> 00:34:11,125
Don't perform a ritual here.
He may barge in anytime.

522
00:34:13,333 --> 00:34:14,958
Hail Lord Shiva!

523
00:34:16,541 --> 00:34:17,833
Hail Lord Shiva!

524
00:34:17,958 --> 00:34:19,375
- Guruji.
- Hey, don't touch!

525
00:34:19,666 --> 00:34:21,208
You look familiar, Guruji.

526
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,416
Looks like you never
prayed to God before.

527
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,666
You're right.

528
00:34:26,458 --> 00:34:28,291
You will pray to God in the future

529
00:34:28,791 --> 00:34:29,958
with folded hands.

530
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:32,250
Hail Lord Shiva!

531
00:34:32,833 --> 00:34:33,958
You will do all the rituals

532
00:34:37,625 --> 00:34:38,833
and break the coconuts as well.

533
00:34:39,375 --> 00:34:42,708
Hail, God! Please relieve
my Grandma from knee pain.

534
00:34:47,291 --> 00:34:49,583
You will also wear a talisman.

535
00:34:49,666 --> 00:34:54,166
God, bless me with a happy life
without the hassles of marriage!

536
00:34:54,416 --> 00:34:58,750
You will beg God to spare you from
the agony of hell let loose on your life!

537
00:34:58,916 --> 00:35:02,000
God, bless me for the on-site job.

538
00:35:02,083 --> 00:35:03,291
What? Will Chaturvedi allow it?

539
00:35:04,041 --> 00:35:05,000
Hail Lord Shiva!

540
00:35:06,291 --> 00:35:08,625
The girl is from Islamabad.
That's not possible.

541
00:35:08,708 --> 00:35:10,250
- Tell him, dude.
- Yes, sir.

542
00:35:10,416 --> 00:35:11,416
The lover is from Pakistan.

543
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,000
<i>Oh, my dear love</i>

544
00:35:13,083 --> 00:35:14,791
<i>She is from Pakistan</i>

545
00:35:14,875 --> 00:35:17,041
- <i>Oh, my dear love</i>
- Hey, shut up.

546
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:20,083
Stop all this nonsense.

547
00:35:20,625 --> 00:35:23,583
Before you get ready
for getting trapped for life,

548
00:35:24,791 --> 00:35:27,625
take this fruit.

549
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:28,708
It is good for your health.

550
00:35:28,875 --> 00:35:29,958
Guruji, what about me?

551
00:35:30,041 --> 00:35:31,916
You won't need it. He needs it.

552
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:36,125
Convey my regards to Rabdi.

553
00:35:36,208 --> 00:35:37,166
Rabdi?

554
00:35:37,333 --> 00:35:39,166
Hail Lord Shiva!

555
00:35:39,625 --> 00:35:40,708
He is very powerful, sir.

556
00:35:40,916 --> 00:35:43,291
There is some connection
between this fruit and that girl, sir.

557
00:35:43,458 --> 00:35:45,583
- No!
- There is, sir! Trust me.

558
00:35:46,583 --> 00:35:48,791
Look at the way he is
standing like a tower.

559
00:35:48,875 --> 00:35:50,375
- I'll manage him.
- Begum, all okay?

560
00:35:51,041 --> 00:35:52,916
Thank you for everything.
We are leaving.

561
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,458
Please! Don't leave, Begum.

562
00:35:55,375 --> 00:35:58,541
Please come to my exchange tonight
and enjoy our hospitality and dinner.

563
00:35:58,875 --> 00:36:00,250
Both of you sleep with me.

564
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,500
What?

565
00:36:01,583 --> 00:36:02,583
What are you saying?

566
00:36:02,666 --> 00:36:05,708
Is this how you talk to girls?

567
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,750
What did I say, Pitobash?
Why is she upset?

568
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:09,833
She is upset as you didn't
properly speak to her.

569
00:36:09,916 --> 00:36:11,000
No.

570
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,291
Oh, no, that's not what I meant, Begum.

571
00:36:13,958 --> 00:36:17,166
What I meant was that,
both of you come to my place.

572
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:18,166
You can take some rest there.

573
00:36:18,291 --> 00:36:22,250
And we will step out in
search of Feroze in the morning.

574
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,750
It is quite risky
to be surrounded by rowdies.

575
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,833
I feel this fellow is any
day safer than that mob.

576
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,041
But we know nothing about him.

577
00:36:29,375 --> 00:36:30,375
I'll take care of it.

578
00:36:32,666 --> 00:36:33,958
Okay. We will come.

579
00:36:34,583 --> 00:36:36,083
- Please come, Begum.
- Please come.

580
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:37,541
Come.

581
00:36:38,291 --> 00:36:39,291
Go there.

582
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,041
Don't worry.

583
00:36:43,416 --> 00:36:44,791
<i>Hope you had a good veneration, ma'am!</i>

584
00:36:44,916 --> 00:36:46,041
Everything is fine, sir.

585
00:36:46,125 --> 00:36:48,541
Aradhya and I will
reach the resort in the morning.

586
00:36:48,708 --> 00:36:52,250
Just tell me your location.
I will pick you both.

587
00:36:52,375 --> 00:36:56,000
The place seems like a
Telephone Exchange, sir.

588
00:36:56,541 --> 00:36:57,958
The place is…

589
00:36:58,625 --> 00:36:59,500
Hello…

590
00:36:59,791 --> 00:37:01,041
Hello!

591
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:02,583
Hello, Chatur sir.

592
00:37:03,791 --> 00:37:05,250
Is he abandoning us?

593
00:37:05,458 --> 00:37:07,708
No way. You have the presentation.

594
00:37:07,833 --> 00:37:09,500
He needs it to present to the client.

595
00:37:09,583 --> 00:37:13,500
He will come to you.
Just wait and watch.

596
00:37:14,041 --> 00:37:15,791
- Are you sure?
- Begum…

597
00:37:16,166 --> 00:37:18,291
- Oh, no!
- He is back.

598
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:23,583
Begum…

599
00:37:27,375 --> 00:37:30,916
here's a special meal for you from afar.

600
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:32,583
What's this?

601
00:37:33,791 --> 00:37:34,916
Your favorite dish.

602
00:37:41,833 --> 00:37:42,833
Beef Biryani.

603
00:37:50,583 --> 00:37:51,916
- Begum?
- You are an idiot!

604
00:37:54,375 --> 00:37:55,208
Ara!

605
00:37:55,666 --> 00:37:56,541
Crazy fellow.

606
00:37:56,625 --> 00:37:59,708
How dare he offer beef biryani

607
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:02,166
to a vegetarian Brahmin girl like me!

608
00:38:02,375 --> 00:38:04,000
He will pay in hell for this misdeed.

609
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,583
I feel like throwing up, Deepu!

610
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:09,708
Oh, sorry ma'am.

611
00:38:10,333 --> 00:38:12,375
I thought you loved beef
since you are from Pakistan.

612
00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:13,458
Get lost!

613
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:16,125
Don't you have vegetarians in India?

614
00:38:16,333 --> 00:38:18,291
We have vegetarians even in Pakistan.

615
00:38:18,583 --> 00:38:20,958
Ara is a pure vegetarian
Pakistani Muslim.

616
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:24,041
Pakistan-- Vegetarian Muslim?

617
00:38:27,875 --> 00:38:28,833
Oh God!

618
00:38:29,833 --> 00:38:32,416
Where the hell should I
fetch spinach and lentils from?

619
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,583
Thank you, Lord!

620
00:38:34,083 --> 00:38:36,291
Such tasty food after a long time!

621
00:38:36,708 --> 00:38:38,500
I will devour it.

622
00:38:38,958 --> 00:38:39,833
Pito.

623
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:41,125
Sir.

624
00:38:41,291 --> 00:38:43,666
Do you know the meaning of gratitude?

625
00:38:43,916 --> 00:38:45,916
Remembering the good
done by someone for life!

626
00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:48,666
- I will remember her for life!
- Why, sir?

627
00:38:50,541 --> 00:38:52,875
- Sir, I don't eat nonvegetarian food.
- Leave the pieces aside and have the rice!

628
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:54,833
Sir!

629
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,916
Begum…

630
00:38:59,166 --> 00:39:02,208
feel at home.

631
00:39:02,458 --> 00:39:04,291
Don't be shy.

632
00:39:05,041 --> 00:39:05,958
Promise?

633
00:39:10,458 --> 00:39:11,541
Hey, Pito…

634
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:12,916
Are you sleeping here?

635
00:39:13,083 --> 00:39:14,833
Of course! Like every day.

636
00:39:14,958 --> 00:39:15,833
Hey, Pito…

637
00:39:17,416 --> 00:39:20,000
That girl is all alone.

638
00:39:20,916 --> 00:39:22,333
Their parents are not here.

639
00:39:23,916 --> 00:39:27,666
It will be awkward for her
to sleep next to both of us.

640
00:39:27,958 --> 00:39:29,833
What is awkward about
it, sir? She is like my sister.

641
00:39:30,083 --> 00:39:30,916
Isn't she yours too?

642
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:31,833
Hey…

643
00:39:34,916 --> 00:39:35,750
She is my girl.

644
00:39:39,166 --> 00:39:40,000
Begum!

645
00:39:40,333 --> 00:39:41,708
You sleep here.

646
00:39:42,333 --> 00:39:43,166
Please.

647
00:39:43,333 --> 00:39:45,500
I will keep vigil outside.

648
00:39:46,958 --> 00:39:47,833
Please.

649
00:39:48,375 --> 00:39:50,125
I can't bear the chill outside, sir.

650
00:39:50,208 --> 00:39:51,166
Hey, let's go.

651
00:39:51,375 --> 00:39:52,208
Sir.

652
00:39:53,708 --> 00:39:55,500
How do they say "Good Night" in Pakistan?

653
00:39:55,583 --> 00:39:56,416
<i>Shabba khair.</i>

654
00:39:59,625 --> 00:40:01,041
<i>Shabba khair,</i> Begum.

655
00:40:01,958 --> 00:40:03,250
<i>Shabba khair.</i>

656
00:40:03,958 --> 00:40:04,791
<i>Shabba khair.</i>

657
00:40:05,041 --> 00:40:06,041
<i>Shabba khair.</i>

658
00:40:10,375 --> 00:40:12,750
He is trying his best to seduce me.

659
00:40:13,875 --> 00:40:17,958
If I am not careful, I will become an
easy prey to him in this snowy weather.

660
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:19,416
I have an idea.

661
00:40:19,791 --> 00:40:20,625
Tell me.

662
00:41:07,625 --> 00:41:12,291
<i>Love with Aara</i>
<i>Beauty is her place…</i>

663
00:41:12,625 --> 00:41:17,333
<i>Sir is excited Begum is confused</i>

664
00:41:17,791 --> 00:41:22,291
<i>Love with Aara</i>
<i>Beauty is her place…</i>

665
00:41:22,708 --> 00:41:23,541
<i>My heart wants more</i>

666
00:41:23,625 --> 00:41:25,875
Hey, come here.

667
00:41:27,791 --> 00:41:29,166
<i>You are my Roja</i>

668
00:41:30,416 --> 00:41:31,875
<i>You are my dil se</i>

669
00:41:32,958 --> 00:41:34,416
<i>You are my Anjali</i>

670
00:41:35,416 --> 00:41:36,916
<i>You are my Geetanjali</i>

671
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,541
<i>You are my Roja</i>

672
00:41:40,541 --> 00:41:42,083
<i>You are my dil se</i>

673
00:41:43,041 --> 00:41:44,541
<i>You are my Anjali</i>

674
00:41:45,083 --> 00:41:47,083
<i>You are my Geetanjali</i>

675
00:42:09,208 --> 00:42:10,708
He is her younger brother.

676
00:42:10,833 --> 00:42:12,166
No, I didn't see anyone.

677
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:15,458
Did you see a small boy named Feroze?

678
00:42:15,541 --> 00:42:16,750
Go and search there.

679
00:42:16,875 --> 00:42:19,041
- Did you see a small boy?
- No.

680
00:42:19,125 --> 00:42:21,208
- Please have a look at her.
- No.

681
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:24,541
Thank you.

682
00:42:26,083 --> 00:42:26,916
Sorry, Begum.

683
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:32,000
<i>In the ocean waves</i>
<i>You are my silent melody</i>

684
00:42:32,125 --> 00:42:37,083
<i>In your divine torrent</i>
<i>A fight started</i>

685
00:42:37,166 --> 00:42:42,083
<i>You are my partner</i>
<i>I am your commander</i>

686
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:46,583
<i>You are my friend I am your leader</i>

687
00:42:46,666 --> 00:42:52,000
<i>I will accept whatever decision you make</i>

688
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:55,208
<i>Okay, sweetheart</i>

689
00:42:56,416 --> 00:42:58,208
<i>You are my Roja</i>

690
00:42:58,916 --> 00:43:01,333
<i>You are my dil se</i>

691
00:43:01,458 --> 00:43:03,500
<i>You are my Anjali</i>

692
00:43:03,583 --> 00:43:04,500
Pito…

693
00:43:09,333 --> 00:43:10,333
Oh, God.

694
00:43:12,541 --> 00:43:16,583
Let's get every orphan boy named Feroze
in Kashmir and present him to Begum.

695
00:43:16,916 --> 00:43:18,375
- Get up. Let's go.
- Psycho.

696
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:20,500
- Feroze.
- No.

697
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:23,083
- Feroze.
- <i>Haleem.</i>

698
00:43:23,166 --> 00:43:24,000
<i>Haleem.</i>

699
00:43:24,083 --> 00:43:26,208
Nice name. "555" serves tasty stuff.

700
00:43:26,625 --> 00:43:27,958
Are you Feroze? Oh no!

701
00:43:28,958 --> 00:43:29,958
I am Feroze!

702
00:43:36,458 --> 00:43:39,625
Useless fellow, Feroze!
You don't know how to do this.

703
00:43:39,958 --> 00:43:41,333
Don't know how the world works.

704
00:43:42,458 --> 00:43:44,625
Hey, Feroze, where are
you taking the flock to?

705
00:43:45,958 --> 00:43:47,166
Hey, Feroze…

706
00:43:51,708 --> 00:43:52,750
Praise the Lord.

707
00:43:57,416 --> 00:43:58,333
Feroze?

708
00:43:58,916 --> 00:43:59,791
Come here.

709
00:44:02,125 --> 00:44:03,875
Where's your mom and dad?

710
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:05,083
Not there?

711
00:44:05,166 --> 00:44:06,208
Do you want ice cream?

712
00:44:06,291 --> 00:44:08,541
Would you like to have one?
Come with me.

713
00:44:09,208 --> 00:44:10,708
{\an8}Hey, Mustak. Come here.

714
00:44:10,791 --> 00:44:12,750
{\an8}- Someone has kidnapped Feroze.
- He is an orphan but has relatives, sir.

715
00:44:12,958 --> 00:44:14,708
- Who are you all? Someone stop them.
- Sir, we will get caught.

716
00:44:14,791 --> 00:44:16,375
Who is taking Feroze? Stop.

717
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:25,625
Brother, give me two cups of tea.

718
00:44:26,375 --> 00:44:27,583
Hey, Feroze.

719
00:44:30,166 --> 00:44:32,291
If I slap you once, you
will come to your senses.

720
00:44:35,333 --> 00:44:36,833
Did you see his cat eyes, sir?

721
00:44:37,083 --> 00:44:38,625
He may not be Ara's brother.

722
00:44:39,291 --> 00:44:41,416
Let Begum confirm that, not you.

723
00:44:43,791 --> 00:44:47,458
- Ready. One, two, three!
- Praise the Lord!

724
00:44:47,541 --> 00:44:50,083
- Chatur Sir, listen to me.
- <i>Where the hell are you guys?</i>

725
00:44:50,625 --> 00:44:51,666
Stop scolding, sir.

726
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:54,083
- This is a hill station called Pampur.
- What?

727
00:44:54,333 --> 00:44:55,166
There…

728
00:44:55,458 --> 00:44:57,583
Come on, boys. Hey, get them.

729
00:44:58,875 --> 00:44:59,750
Begum…

730
00:45:01,291 --> 00:45:02,625
all of them are named Feroze.

731
00:45:03,416 --> 00:45:04,250
Come here.

732
00:45:04,375 --> 00:45:06,333
Who is your Feroze here?

733
00:45:08,666 --> 00:45:09,500
No one.

734
00:45:09,833 --> 00:45:11,750
Ma'am, just look at him once.

735
00:45:12,625 --> 00:45:15,458
Look at him. He looks just like you.

736
00:45:17,166 --> 00:45:18,041
No.

737
00:45:23,625 --> 00:45:25,083
Drop them back, Pitobash.

738
00:45:25,625 --> 00:45:26,666
Come on. Let's go.

739
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:27,833
No, we won't leave.

740
00:45:27,916 --> 00:45:30,375
Why won't you go? We
can't feed you food. Let's go.

741
00:45:30,541 --> 00:45:33,166
If we go back, we will all get beaten up.

742
00:45:33,333 --> 00:45:35,791
Yes, brother. They will beat us all.

743
00:45:48,333 --> 00:45:49,625
It's all because of you.

744
00:45:49,875 --> 00:45:54,250
He is roaming with us just
because you made up a story.

745
00:45:54,666 --> 00:45:55,875
- Let me tell the truth.
- Hey!

746
00:45:56,458 --> 00:45:58,666
Just stay silent for a day.
We shall leave tomorrow.

747
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,250
Chatur sir is on his way.

748
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:03,833
Karim, my friend is here from Hyderabad.

749
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,375
These are all the
boys who lost their way.

750
00:46:05,458 --> 00:46:08,083
Please check the register and
call for any of their kith and kin.

751
00:46:08,291 --> 00:46:09,708
- What's the name?
- Feroze.

752
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:12,958
A boy called Feroze has gone missing.

753
00:46:13,083 --> 00:46:16,583
If there's anyone amongst you
who is their parent, please come here.

754
00:46:16,708 --> 00:46:19,625
A boy called Feroze has gone missing.

755
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:22,000
A boy called Feroze has gone missing.

756
00:46:22,083 --> 00:46:22,958
Feroze…

757
00:46:25,083 --> 00:46:27,000
Feroze!

758
00:46:29,083 --> 00:46:30,250
Mom.

759
00:46:30,583 --> 00:46:32,416
My son!

760
00:46:33,833 --> 00:46:34,750
Mom!

761
00:46:48,375 --> 00:46:49,666
Where did you go?

762
00:46:50,916 --> 00:46:52,166
Where did you go?

763
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:55,625
Begum…

764
00:46:57,125 --> 00:46:59,291
I did all this to impress you…

765
00:47:01,833 --> 00:47:03,625
but looking at this
mother's separation pangs.

766
00:47:05,333 --> 00:47:07,375
I promise you will find your
Feroze before you go to Pakistan.

767
00:47:29,166 --> 00:47:34,333
<i>At the beginning of my love</i>
<i>You became my continuity</i>

768
00:47:34,416 --> 00:47:39,416
<i>To your heartbeat</i>
<i>I can become the echo</i>

769
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:44,458
<i>When our eyes meet mine</i>
<i>I dreamt of many dreams</i>

770
00:47:44,541 --> 00:47:48,791
<i>I want to be in your footsteps in</i>
<i>your Journey and be in your shadow</i>

771
00:47:48,916 --> 00:47:54,541
<i>I will agree to whatever you say</i>

772
00:47:54,625 --> 00:47:56,791
<i>Is that fine, Begum?</i>

773
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:03,291
<i>Love with Aara Beauty is her place</i>

774
00:48:03,458 --> 00:48:07,791
<i>Sir is excited Begum is confused</i>

775
00:48:08,875 --> 00:48:10,458
<i>You are my Roja</i>

776
00:48:11,375 --> 00:48:13,041
<i>You are my dil se</i>

777
00:48:13,208 --> 00:48:14,041
Hello.

778
00:48:14,208 --> 00:48:16,250
Chatur sir, where are you now?

779
00:48:16,541 --> 00:48:18,083
I am near Pampur.

780
00:48:18,208 --> 00:48:20,875
Something is wrong over here.
Please come fast.

781
00:48:21,583 --> 00:48:26,125
<i>Love with Aara Beauty is her place</i>

782
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:30,750
<i>Sir is excited Begum is confused</i>

783
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:33,416
<i>You are my roja</i>

784
00:48:34,291 --> 00:48:35,791
<i>You are my dil se</i>

785
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:38,208
<i>You are my Anjali</i>

786
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:40,750
<i>You are my Geethanjali</i>

787
00:48:41,833 --> 00:48:43,333
<i>You are my roja</i>

788
00:48:44,333 --> 00:48:45,875
<i>You are my dil se</i>

789
00:48:46,875 --> 00:48:48,333
<i>You are my Anjali</i>

790
00:48:49,083 --> 00:48:51,333
<i>You are my Geethanjali</i>

791
00:48:59,708 --> 00:49:00,541
Deepu…

792
00:49:02,583 --> 00:49:04,416
I want to tell the truth to Viplav.

793
00:49:26,833 --> 00:49:27,666
Begum.

794
00:49:28,708 --> 00:49:29,541
What happened?

795
00:49:30,875 --> 00:49:32,125
Aren't you able to sleep?

796
00:49:34,416 --> 00:49:36,125
Please come, Begum. Please sit.

797
00:49:37,208 --> 00:49:38,416
Please sit. Two minutes.

798
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:43,166
It's cold, right?

799
00:49:44,291 --> 00:49:45,375
Even I couldn't sleep.

800
00:49:51,166 --> 00:49:53,291
Do you know how I am feeling, Begum?

801
00:49:54,625 --> 00:49:55,625
This looks like our home…

802
00:49:57,833 --> 00:49:59,250
where we are happily married…

803
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:03,500
with two kids.

804
00:50:03,958 --> 00:50:07,958
I feel as if we just served
them dinner and put them to bed,

805
00:50:08,833 --> 00:50:13,416
and merrily chatting in
the balcony outside like this.

806
00:50:15,916 --> 00:50:17,416
I can live my life this way.

807
00:50:21,375 --> 00:50:23,625
And pass out one day
just staring at you, Begum.

808
00:50:25,958 --> 00:50:27,416
I didn't understand at all.

809
00:50:28,666 --> 00:50:29,500
I know!

810
00:50:41,875 --> 00:50:44,291
Uncle, one special tea
with double cashew nuts!

811
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:46,000
You won't drink?

812
00:50:46,083 --> 00:50:47,708
I will have it with Begum.

813
00:50:47,791 --> 00:50:48,625
Really?

814
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,208
Just like Begum warmed up to tea,

815
00:50:53,416 --> 00:50:55,041
she will take a liking
to me too in the future.

816
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:59,791
I hope you will come
to visit me in Pakistan!

817
00:51:00,333 --> 00:51:01,250
I will if you are alive.

818
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:04,583
Thank you, Uncle.

819
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:08,416
Write in my account.

820
00:51:09,583 --> 00:51:12,125
What's the point of
walking so far just to get tea?

821
00:51:12,208 --> 00:51:13,041
My legs are hurting.

822
00:51:13,125 --> 00:51:13,958
This tea can be had…

823
00:51:14,708 --> 00:51:15,666
Begum is sleeping.

824
00:51:16,166 --> 00:51:17,000
Okay.

825
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:21,833
Begum…

826
00:51:24,708 --> 00:51:25,541
Begum…

827
00:51:28,333 --> 00:51:29,291
Ara Begum!

828
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:32,625
Sir…

829
00:51:34,083 --> 00:51:35,000
please look there.

830
00:51:37,791 --> 00:51:38,875
Begum has fled.

831
00:51:39,125 --> 00:51:40,541
Keep munching cashew nuts now.

832
00:51:42,208 --> 00:51:43,541
You were talking about Pakistan.

833
00:51:47,166 --> 00:51:49,458
These days there's
no guarantee for lovers.

834
00:51:49,541 --> 00:51:51,000
Whereas yours is from Pakistan.

835
00:51:51,083 --> 00:51:52,041
WE HAVE FOUND FEROZE.
WE ARE LEAVING FOR PAKISTAN.

836
00:51:52,166 --> 00:51:54,250
She found her younger
brother and hence she left.

837
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:57,291
No problem. Let's go and sleep inside.

838
00:51:57,625 --> 00:52:00,333
- It is biting cold outside.
- Begum still loves me.

839
00:52:02,125 --> 00:52:03,250
I've seen it.

840
00:52:05,958 --> 00:52:06,833
Didn't you?

841
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,458
Ours is an inter-nation marriage.

842
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:14,458
Maybe, she was skeptical
about it and hence she left.

843
00:52:19,291 --> 00:52:21,458
If need be, I will even
take Sania Mirza's help

844
00:52:22,083 --> 00:52:24,208
to reach out to her family to
convince her elders for the marriage.

845
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:28,333
Sir, the Begum would have
taken the Amritsar Express by now

846
00:52:28,458 --> 00:52:30,166
to cross the Wagah border.

847
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:34,791
- Come, let's go to Pakistan.
- Pa--

848
00:52:52,375 --> 00:52:53,375
JAMMU TAWI - AMRITSAR

849
00:53:01,541 --> 00:53:05,833
Brother, did you see two Muslim
girls along with a young boy?

850
00:53:12,291 --> 00:53:13,166
Pitobash.

851
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,041
JAMMU TAWI - HYDERABAD - TIRUPATI

852
00:53:17,750 --> 00:53:19,833
Michael, the presentation--

853
00:53:19,916 --> 00:53:21,291
- Why are you blocking the way?
- Hey, you fool.

854
00:53:31,791 --> 00:53:33,125
Why did you do this, Ara?

855
00:53:35,125 --> 00:53:36,416
I fell in love with you

856
00:53:37,666 --> 00:53:40,000
and you ditched me like this.

857
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:44,208
Oh, man! I can't talk in Hindi.

858
00:53:44,541 --> 00:53:45,625
Do something, Pitobash.

859
00:53:45,708 --> 00:53:47,500
Ma'am, please. Please go there.

860
00:53:48,458 --> 00:53:49,291
Sir!

861
00:53:50,291 --> 00:53:51,125
Begum…

862
00:53:52,666 --> 00:53:55,208
I already told you, I am
with you till death do us part.

863
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:58,500
I know you have the same feelings for me.

864
00:53:59,416 --> 00:54:02,458
Don't get scared. Let's go to Pakistan.

865
00:54:03,166 --> 00:54:05,583
We need to get on to the
train to Pakistan, Begum.

866
00:54:05,708 --> 00:54:07,708
- Not this one. This one goes to Hyderabad.
- Yes, that's right.

867
00:54:07,916 --> 00:54:09,541
Let's leave now. I am coming with you.

868
00:54:10,083 --> 00:54:11,083
Give the luggage, ma'am.

869
00:54:11,791 --> 00:54:14,000
Where's Feroze? Look for him, dude.

870
00:54:14,083 --> 00:54:16,000
- Feroze!
- Tell me, Begum.

871
00:54:17,583 --> 00:54:18,416
I am not a Begum.

872
00:54:19,166 --> 00:54:20,000
Brahmin.

873
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:21,666
Pitobash…

874
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:25,041
did she just speak in Telugu?

875
00:54:25,333 --> 00:54:26,416
She also said she's a Brahmin.

876
00:54:26,541 --> 00:54:28,000
- Br… Brahmin?
- Yes.

877
00:54:30,083 --> 00:54:31,041
My name is Aradhya.

878
00:54:32,125 --> 00:54:32,958
From Kakinada.

879
00:54:33,041 --> 00:54:35,458
- Kaki--
- What's happening here, dude?

880
00:54:36,666 --> 00:54:38,958
What about Feroze?

881
00:54:39,916 --> 00:54:40,791
And Pakistan?

882
00:54:43,875 --> 00:54:47,375
We just made it up to

883
00:54:48,208 --> 00:54:49,458
avoid getting followed by you.

884
00:54:49,875 --> 00:54:52,333
You can make up words, but
you can't change countries like this.

885
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:54,708
Forget all that.

886
00:54:56,791 --> 00:54:58,250
Do you love me?

887
00:55:02,708 --> 00:55:04,875
I believe in God and destiny.

888
00:55:06,541 --> 00:55:08,791
After passing all the
hurdles, I held your hand

889
00:55:09,708 --> 00:55:12,125
and felt blessed after having
visiting Mamuleshwar Lord.

890
00:55:15,375 --> 00:55:17,416
Those days spent with you at the Exchange

891
00:55:18,458 --> 00:55:22,583
and the pains you took to search for a
Feroze who didn't exist melted my heart.

892
00:55:24,666 --> 00:55:27,791
I fought hard to hide
my feelings towards you.

893
00:55:32,875 --> 00:55:34,625
Without knowing anything
about me or my antecedents, you

894
00:55:34,708 --> 00:55:36,166
were prepared to spend
the rest of your life with me.

895
00:55:38,041 --> 00:55:40,125
That very moment I fell in love with you.

896
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:41,125
But--

897
00:55:41,291 --> 00:55:42,208
That's enough.

898
00:55:43,958 --> 00:55:45,625
I will never leave your hand.

899
00:55:47,458 --> 00:55:48,291
Hey, saint.

900
00:55:49,041 --> 00:55:51,083
Can we stop that nonsense for a while?

901
00:55:51,875 --> 00:55:53,250
I am discussing the most
important matter of my life.

902
00:55:53,333 --> 00:55:54,416
- Nonsense! Don't talk like that.
- Hey!

903
00:55:55,166 --> 00:55:57,333
- You can't call that nonsense, dear.
- Hey, it's all a nuisance.

904
00:55:57,750 --> 00:56:00,166
It's a holy discourse.
Seek his pardon.

905
00:56:00,958 --> 00:56:01,916
Do it, sir.

906
00:56:03,083 --> 00:56:04,625
The discourse is by my dad himself.

907
00:56:08,291 --> 00:56:09,125
Who is it?

908
00:56:09,208 --> 00:56:10,041
Don't you know him?

909
00:56:10,291 --> 00:56:12,083
The famous preacher from Kakinada.

910
00:56:12,333 --> 00:56:14,958
Don't you know
Mr. Chadarangam Srinivas Rao himself?

911
00:56:30,625 --> 00:56:32,208
Our religion is an eternal one.

912
00:56:34,541 --> 00:56:38,708
It outlasted various invasions
and the attacks from atheists.

913
00:56:39,875 --> 00:56:40,833
The path of devotion.

914
00:56:44,625 --> 00:56:45,916
Don't you see the "Bhakti" channel?

915
00:56:47,375 --> 00:56:48,500
Do you know my dad?

916
00:56:48,958 --> 00:56:49,833
Who?

917
00:56:50,375 --> 00:56:52,291
He is the president of the
State Atheists Association.

918
00:56:53,125 --> 00:56:54,125
Lenin Satyam.

919
00:56:54,833 --> 00:56:56,208
Are you his son?

920
00:56:56,750 --> 00:56:57,583
Yes.

921
00:56:58,833 --> 00:57:02,625
Well, then both our dads hate each
other and are diametrically opposite.

922
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,166
Do you think this will work out?

923
00:57:08,416 --> 00:57:10,000
I didn't give up when it was Pakistan.

924
00:57:11,416 --> 00:57:12,833
I won't give up now
even if it's Kakinada.

925
00:57:15,166 --> 00:57:16,000
Don't give up.

926
00:57:20,666 --> 00:57:23,416
In two weeks, we'll witness
a complete lunar eclipse.

927
00:57:23,541 --> 00:57:25,750
While the atheists are describing
it as a celestial spectacle,

928
00:57:25,833 --> 00:57:28,083
the pandits are apprehending
it will bring in more doom.

929
00:57:28,166 --> 00:57:29,708
We'll soon find out the truth.

930
00:57:29,791 --> 00:57:31,625
Let's welcome our two seasoned speakers,

931
00:57:31,833 --> 00:57:34,541
famous atheist, Mr. Satyam Lenin

932
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:36,583
and noted Hindu preceptor,

933
00:57:36,666 --> 00:57:39,041
Mr. Chadarangam Srinivas Rao
who will debate this out.

934
00:57:39,208 --> 00:57:40,833
- Welcome, Mr. Chadarangam.
- Greetings.

935
00:57:40,916 --> 00:57:43,916
Can we see the moon on new moon day?

936
00:57:44,583 --> 00:57:47,083
{\an8}The lunar eclipse happens
because of Rahu.

937
00:57:47,875 --> 00:57:51,000
{\an8}This lunar eclipse happens
because Rahu is swallowing the moon.

938
00:57:51,458 --> 00:57:52,833
Is the moon chocolate…

939
00:57:54,208 --> 00:57:55,250
to be swallowed by Rahu?

940
00:57:56,333 --> 00:57:59,375
Where is Rahu to be found
amongst our nine planets?

941
00:57:59,708 --> 00:58:02,583
{\an8}It's just a shadow of
the earth on the moon.

942
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:06,250
You are unnecessarily scaring the public.

943
00:58:06,333 --> 00:58:07,166
Look here.

944
00:58:07,333 --> 00:58:11,333
Our saints have determined the planetary
movements without the help of a telescope.

945
00:58:11,625 --> 00:58:13,000
What do you have to say to that?

946
00:58:13,958 --> 00:58:15,958
What's this crap about
saints and spirits?

947
00:58:16,125 --> 00:58:18,833
It's better if such
people stay at ashrams.

948
00:58:19,208 --> 00:58:20,375
{\an8}We won't keep quiet if they have.

949
00:58:20,458 --> 00:58:23,083
{\an8}We cannot suffer their stupid
views corrupting the public.

950
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:25,083
{\an8}You please share your
views Mr. Chadarangam

951
00:58:25,166 --> 00:58:27,708
{\an8}and the list of do's and don'ts that day.

952
00:58:28,666 --> 00:58:29,500
{\an8}Nothing dramatic.

953
00:58:29,833 --> 00:58:33,416
You shouldn't have any food
or take a bath during the eclipse.

954
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:35,000
Can we take nature's calls?

955
00:58:36,625 --> 00:58:41,375
Don't you go to the doctor
if you get a heart attack or an ache?

956
00:58:41,916 --> 00:58:45,666
{\an8}We should be ashamed of why we are
organizing such debates such as this.

957
00:58:45,791 --> 00:58:46,833
{\an8}- This is ridiculous.
- Please!

958
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,958
{\an8}- I will not talk to this brainless fellow.
- Mr. Satyam.

959
00:58:50,166 --> 00:58:52,583
- Please, Mr. Satyam. Let's talk.
- What is there to talk about?

960
00:58:53,208 --> 00:58:54,791
Why is he talking without decorum?

961
00:58:54,875 --> 00:58:55,750
One minute. Please stop.

962
00:58:55,833 --> 00:58:58,500
He talks only baloney. How
can he command any respect?

963
00:58:58,583 --> 00:59:00,833
- Let's have a nice debate.
- Why are you barking like a dog?

964
00:59:01,083 --> 00:59:03,250
Did the dog bite you
on the way to the studio?

965
00:59:03,708 --> 00:59:05,916
Uncle, let's leave now.
We have to catch the train.

966
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,833
They are conveniently evading
us and running away from here.

967
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:11,291
We are not scared.

968
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:12,833
You are safe because
this is not Kakinada.

969
00:59:13,125 --> 00:59:15,250
Step in Kakinada to see
who is more powerful.

970
00:59:15,333 --> 00:59:16,500
- Calm down, son.
- Shut up and get out.

971
00:59:16,583 --> 00:59:18,416
Why talk with such ignoramuses?

972
00:59:18,916 --> 00:59:21,041
See how he is talking without
any etiquette and restraint?

973
00:59:21,458 --> 00:59:22,291
Jaffer…

974
00:59:22,625 --> 00:59:25,583
Don't call me for a debate
with this fellow ever again.

975
00:59:25,708 --> 00:59:26,541
It's over.

976
00:59:27,708 --> 00:59:31,500
{\an8}Sir, Viplav requested for an immediate
transfer from Kashmir to Hyderabad.

977
00:59:31,875 --> 00:59:35,666
His mother has asthma.

978
00:59:36,291 --> 00:59:39,250
His father has back pain issues.

979
00:59:39,791 --> 00:59:41,208
He has to take care of his parents.

980
00:59:42,625 --> 00:59:44,166
Okay, sir. Thank you, sir.

981
00:59:48,958 --> 00:59:51,916
{\an8}What a breezy love story in just a week
of seeing each other! And now marriage.

982
00:59:54,666 --> 00:59:56,250
{\an8}Is she so good-looking?

983
00:59:57,458 --> 00:59:59,291
She is as beautiful as
the Kakinada beach, ma'am.

984
01:00:23,375 --> 01:00:26,958
My granddaughter prayed for me

985
01:00:27,208 --> 01:00:30,458
at Mamuleshwar temple.

986
01:00:30,750 --> 01:00:33,250
I got fully cured after that.

987
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:43,958
Mr. Chadarangam.

988
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,708
This is our contribution towards
your discourse at Annavaram.

989
01:00:48,125 --> 01:00:48,958
Oh, no!

990
01:00:49,041 --> 01:00:51,375
I don't take money for giving discourses.

991
01:00:51,958 --> 01:00:53,250
It's all in the service of God.

992
01:00:54,625 --> 01:00:55,500
Mr. Sankarrao.

993
01:00:55,583 --> 01:00:56,791
Did you see NTV last night?

994
01:00:57,291 --> 01:01:00,166
My uncle gave a proper comeuppance
to that stupid atheist Satyam.

995
01:01:00,333 --> 01:01:01,166
I saw that, sir.

996
01:01:01,416 --> 01:01:03,000
He is the perfect antidote to such folks.

997
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:09,416
She is singing well. Are you
looking for a groom for her?

998
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:10,833
Yes.

999
01:01:14,666 --> 01:01:18,416
<i>We should be ashamed of why</i>
<i>we are organizing such debates!</i>

1000
01:01:18,916 --> 01:01:20,500
<i>Why are you barking like a dog?</i>

1001
01:01:20,916 --> 01:01:23,291
<i>Did the dog bite you</i>
<i>on the way to the studio?</i>

1002
01:01:23,833 --> 01:01:24,708
Jaffer!

1003
01:01:25,041 --> 01:01:27,250
On the next new moon day,
all of us are going to watch

1004
01:01:27,333 --> 01:01:30,208
the lunar eclipse and
have our favorite biryani.

1005
01:01:30,958 --> 01:01:32,708
If we don't get harmed,

1006
01:01:32,958 --> 01:01:35,833
ask if Mr. Chadarangam
can keep quiet after that.

1007
01:01:36,125 --> 01:01:38,333
Call him for a debate.
I will not spare him.

1008
01:01:39,041 --> 01:01:42,000
Arrange discussion in
Kakinada if possible. I'll come.

1009
01:01:49,041 --> 01:01:51,291
Oh, no, it's you!

1010
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:54,083
I dreaded if it was your dad.

1011
01:01:55,291 --> 01:01:59,208
Mr. Chadarangam's
discourses are engrossing.

1012
01:01:59,291 --> 01:02:00,125
Mom!

1013
01:02:01,791 --> 01:02:04,291
Do you know Mr. Chadarangam's
daughter is even better.

1014
01:02:04,916 --> 01:02:06,541
What? Who are you talking about?

1015
01:02:12,083 --> 01:02:12,916
Your daughter-in-law.

1016
01:02:13,791 --> 01:02:14,833
She is so beautiful.

1017
01:02:15,250 --> 01:02:16,541
She is Mr. Chadarangam's daughter.

1018
01:02:17,541 --> 01:02:18,500
Her name is Aradhya.

1019
01:02:20,208 --> 01:02:22,041
We met in Kashmir and fell in love.

1020
01:02:24,083 --> 01:02:25,291
Only you can get us married, Mom.

1021
01:02:26,166 --> 01:02:29,750
I pray that it happens for real.

1022
01:02:30,125 --> 01:02:34,000
At least, she will address
me as "Mother-in-law"

1023
01:02:34,291 --> 01:02:37,250
instead of mispronouncing
my name like your sister-in-law.

1024
01:02:37,416 --> 01:02:38,250
Am I right?

1025
01:02:38,333 --> 01:02:39,166
Shall I call her?

1026
01:02:39,375 --> 01:02:40,958
- Right now?
- I will call her.

1027
01:02:47,125 --> 01:02:47,958
Viplav!

1028
01:02:48,375 --> 01:02:49,958
- Baby!
- Baby!

1029
01:02:51,708 --> 01:02:52,583
Talk to my mom.

1030
01:02:53,875 --> 01:02:54,708
Here you go.

1031
01:02:56,333 --> 01:02:57,166
<i>Hello!</i>

1032
01:02:57,250 --> 01:02:58,083
Auntie.

1033
01:02:58,375 --> 01:03:00,750
Can you call me Mother-in-law?

1034
01:03:02,416 --> 01:03:03,250
Mother-in-law!

1035
01:03:04,833 --> 01:03:06,041
One more time!

1036
01:03:07,166 --> 01:03:08,000
Mother-in-law!

1037
01:03:09,416 --> 01:03:11,416
What a blessing!

1038
01:03:11,791 --> 01:03:14,166
Hey, who's this "Mother-in-law"?

1039
01:03:16,291 --> 01:03:17,125
In Kashmir…

1040
01:03:17,791 --> 01:03:18,666
In Kashmir?

1041
01:03:21,041 --> 01:03:22,625
I fell in love with this boy, Grandma.

1042
01:03:23,208 --> 01:03:24,166
Who's this boy?

1043
01:03:25,041 --> 01:03:26,375
Did you take your tablets?

1044
01:03:29,208 --> 01:03:30,250
Son of Mr. Lenin Satyam.

1045
01:03:30,333 --> 01:03:33,166
Oh, my God! Son of Lenin Satyam?

1046
01:03:33,291 --> 01:03:34,625
Grandma, quiet!

1047
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,916
He is coming to Annavaram
tomorrow to talk to Dad.

1048
01:03:37,250 --> 01:03:38,166
You must take care of the rest.

1049
01:03:38,416 --> 01:03:40,750
I can't?

1050
01:03:41,625 --> 01:03:42,583
Please…

1051
01:03:43,875 --> 01:03:44,791
Oh God!

1052
01:03:44,958 --> 01:03:46,041
Annavaram!

1053
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:47,833
Annavaram?

1054
01:03:48,166 --> 01:03:50,250
Dad will censure us if hears this!

1055
01:03:50,333 --> 01:03:51,708
Let's do it before he comes to know.

1056
01:03:51,916 --> 01:03:53,416
- Don't involve me in this.
- Mom…

1057
01:03:53,958 --> 01:03:55,375
She will call you mother-in-law, Mom.

1058
01:04:08,416 --> 01:04:11,541
Tulasidas wrote this brilliant
line in Hanuman Chalisa.

1059
01:04:12,375 --> 01:04:17,041
It describes how Lord Hanuman
leaped into the sky seeing a glowing sun…

1060
01:04:17,583 --> 01:04:20,791
mistaking it for a fruit and traveled
thousands of miles to kiss the Sun.

1061
01:04:22,166 --> 01:04:25,291
That's how powerful Hanuman is.

1062
01:04:26,458 --> 01:04:27,541
Hail Hanuman!

1063
01:04:27,750 --> 01:04:29,041
Hail Hanuman!

1064
01:04:29,333 --> 01:04:30,458
This is enough for my life, son.

1065
01:04:30,541 --> 01:04:32,583
Forget about the devotion,
focus on the main job, Mom.

1066
01:04:32,958 --> 01:04:34,291
- Come and talk.
- Me?

1067
01:04:34,458 --> 01:04:35,916
- Salutations, sir.
- Dear.

1068
01:04:36,291 --> 01:04:38,000
Blessings to you. Who are you?

1069
01:04:38,166 --> 01:04:40,375
- I am your big fan, sir.
- Great.

1070
01:04:42,250 --> 01:04:46,833
- Both of us are deeply religious, Guruji.
- It is quite self-evident.

1071
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,166
But my husband is an atheist.

1072
01:04:49,250 --> 01:04:50,583
He doesn't even bow before God, Guruji.

1073
01:04:50,833 --> 01:04:52,375
- He…
- And chastises anyone who does it.

1074
01:04:52,708 --> 01:04:54,416
He even beats them, Guruji.

1075
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:56,708
Everyone is different in a family.

1076
01:04:57,208 --> 01:05:02,375
Don't you feel angry
about such people, Guruji?

1077
01:05:03,708 --> 01:05:05,583
Why should I get angry with your husband?

1078
01:05:09,250 --> 01:05:10,083
Ask him, Mom.

1079
01:05:10,875 --> 01:05:12,166
Then…

1080
01:05:12,750 --> 01:05:17,041
will you give consent to your
daughter Aradhya to marry my son?

1081
01:05:18,708 --> 01:05:19,541
What?

1082
01:05:20,833 --> 01:05:21,750
Marriage?

1083
01:05:21,916 --> 01:05:23,666
I am Mr. Lenin Satyam's son, Guruji.

1084
01:05:24,125 --> 01:05:25,541
Aradhya and I love each other.

1085
01:05:26,041 --> 01:05:28,541
We would like to get
married, if you agree.

1086
01:05:28,875 --> 01:05:32,125
With just a twist of logic, look how
they trapped our daughter, Uncle.

1087
01:05:32,583 --> 01:05:34,000
And the alliance is the
son of the noted atheist.

1088
01:05:34,083 --> 01:05:35,541
At least Aradhya should
have had some sense.

1089
01:05:41,416 --> 01:05:43,583
- Oh, Guruji is leaving.
- Mom.

1090
01:05:43,958 --> 01:05:44,833
Guruji!

1091
01:05:49,375 --> 01:05:52,833
How did you fall in
love with Satyam's son?

1092
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:55,333
I didn't know that Viplav
is Mr. Satyam's son, Dad.

1093
01:05:55,666 --> 01:05:56,666
Mr. Satyam, it seems!

1094
01:05:59,333 --> 01:06:00,666
He is an educated fool.

1095
01:06:01,458 --> 01:06:04,041
He undermines the faith of people and
keeps hurting their religious sentiments.

1096
01:06:04,125 --> 01:06:05,791
Why should we have an
alliance with such folks?

1097
01:06:07,375 --> 01:06:08,291
We should have some discretion.

1098
01:06:08,416 --> 01:06:10,208
Love knows no discretion.

1099
01:06:10,708 --> 01:06:12,166
At least you should have had some sense.

1100
01:06:12,666 --> 01:06:14,375
Why are you defending her?

1101
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:20,125
Well, haven't you seen the boy
and his mother in the temple?

1102
01:06:20,416 --> 01:06:23,208
They were so good and
the boy looks handsome.

1103
01:06:23,291 --> 01:06:25,208
We have seen many folks like him.

1104
01:06:25,333 --> 01:06:26,750
You please stop.

1105
01:06:26,875 --> 01:06:27,708
You wait.

1106
01:06:28,583 --> 01:06:32,333
Both, the boy and
the girl love each other.

1107
01:06:33,083 --> 01:06:35,000
Let's go as per our tradition.

1108
01:06:35,375 --> 01:06:37,625
We will wait for
Satyam's consent as well.

1109
01:06:37,916 --> 01:06:39,833
- What do you think?
- Why should we even talk to them?

1110
01:06:40,458 --> 01:06:42,041
Do we want to push our
daughter into that dungeon?

1111
01:06:42,125 --> 01:06:42,958
Uncle!

1112
01:06:43,041 --> 01:06:45,000
- We'll send her off. Who am I?
- Uncle…

1113
01:06:46,041 --> 01:06:47,666
He is coming here because of his son.

1114
01:06:48,208 --> 01:06:49,125
He needs it now.

1115
01:06:49,916 --> 01:06:52,250
We will settle scores
with him right here.

1116
01:06:52,750 --> 01:06:54,125
Dear son, look at her face.

1117
01:06:55,208 --> 01:06:56,500
Uncle, please agree. We will needle him.

1118
01:06:56,708 --> 01:06:59,333
She is very keen on
him. He is a good boy.

1119
01:06:59,416 --> 01:07:01,541
- Uncle, accept this. It's a great chance.
- Agree to their marriage.

1120
01:07:03,958 --> 01:07:06,000
Okay, let's talk.

1121
01:07:07,833 --> 01:07:10,708
We will not go home but
meet somewhere outside.

1122
01:07:12,916 --> 01:07:13,750
Let's talk.

1123
01:07:18,250 --> 01:07:19,916
Dad, Aradhya is not like her dad.

1124
01:07:20,416 --> 01:07:22,875
She is very practical
and logical like us.

1125
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:25,250
Mom, didn't you see that?

1126
01:07:26,166 --> 01:07:27,541
She is quite modern, dear.

1127
01:07:28,041 --> 01:07:29,000
Shall I put some powder?

1128
01:07:32,166 --> 01:07:36,666
After marriage, Chadarangam will change
your name from Viplav to Vipranarayana.

1129
01:07:37,083 --> 01:07:40,125
He is a fool who injects ignorance
and dogma into people's minds.

1130
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:41,750
And you fell in love with his daughter.

1131
01:07:41,916 --> 01:07:43,958
Dad, I want to marry Aradhya,

1132
01:07:44,666 --> 01:07:45,666
not her father.

1133
01:07:48,541 --> 01:07:50,708
Anyway, they are visiting us
tomorrow to discuss the alliance.

1134
01:07:53,666 --> 01:07:54,791
Is he coming?

1135
01:07:55,708 --> 01:07:56,708
Let him come.

1136
01:07:57,708 --> 01:08:00,750
But let's meet them somewhere
outside and not in our house.

1137
01:08:02,333 --> 01:08:03,166
Okay, Dad.

1138
01:08:20,083 --> 01:08:21,083
Look…

1139
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,250
According to my uncle, it's not the
appropriate time to talk about marriage.

1140
01:08:24,625 --> 01:08:25,500
What?

1141
01:08:33,416 --> 01:08:34,250
Tell me.

1142
01:08:34,458 --> 01:08:35,833
Let me come straight to the point.

1143
01:08:36,333 --> 01:08:38,208
My son is in love with your daughter.

1144
01:08:38,458 --> 01:08:40,333
Don't stop this marriage. That's it!

1145
01:08:40,458 --> 01:08:41,333
That's it.

1146
01:08:43,291 --> 01:08:46,458
Can you give a good reason why my daughter
deserves to step into your household?

1147
01:08:47,041 --> 01:08:49,916
We are not fussy about
caste, creed, and religion.

1148
01:08:50,208 --> 01:08:51,166
We are not ritualistic.

1149
01:08:51,708 --> 01:08:55,541
We don't pick auspicious
moments for doing anything.

1150
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:57,750
All we care about is they are in love.

1151
01:08:58,250 --> 01:08:59,083
That's all.

1152
01:08:59,208 --> 01:09:00,958
You may think that's enough.

1153
01:09:02,375 --> 01:09:03,750
But we need to match
their horoscopes as well.

1154
01:09:04,625 --> 01:09:05,458
What?

1155
01:09:06,791 --> 01:09:07,750
Horoscopes?

1156
01:09:07,958 --> 01:09:09,125
We don't believe in them.

1157
01:09:09,291 --> 01:09:10,500
We are done here. Come.

1158
01:09:11,208 --> 01:09:12,250
- Viplav. Let's leave.
- Wait.

1159
01:09:12,333 --> 01:09:13,833
- Dad.
- What planet are they from?

1160
01:09:14,208 --> 01:09:16,291
- Let's leave.
- First, why should we get down?

1161
01:09:16,875 --> 01:09:18,166
It will look bad. Let them get down.

1162
01:09:18,416 --> 01:09:19,416
We look bad, Uncle.

1163
01:09:21,708 --> 01:09:22,541
Let's not do it then.

1164
01:09:23,166 --> 01:09:24,000
Sit down, Dad.

1165
01:09:25,541 --> 01:09:27,625
- Is this why you planned this in metro?
- Keep quiet.

1166
01:09:27,958 --> 01:09:29,458
- You're a genius!
- Sit down!

1167
01:09:31,708 --> 01:09:33,416
We don't want to check
the horoscope. What next?

1168
01:09:34,250 --> 01:09:35,416
Well, for whatever good,

1169
01:09:35,708 --> 01:09:38,125
I did cast Viplav's horoscope
when he was born, Guruji!

1170
01:09:39,541 --> 01:09:40,416
Give it.

1171
01:09:41,333 --> 01:09:42,166
Oh, no.

1172
01:09:42,458 --> 01:09:43,291
Oh, no.

1173
01:09:43,375 --> 01:09:44,291
What are you doing?

1174
01:09:52,625 --> 01:09:53,458
It's the original, Guruji.

1175
01:10:11,416 --> 01:10:13,125
The girl's star is Uttarashada.

1176
01:10:14,083 --> 01:10:15,583
The boy's star is Rohini.

1177
01:10:16,125 --> 01:10:18,458
It is going to be opposites
like a snake and a mongoose.

1178
01:10:18,958 --> 01:10:20,083
They will fight till death, Guruji.

1179
01:10:24,541 --> 01:10:26,375
- It's a big defect!
- What?

1180
01:10:27,750 --> 01:10:30,250
If they marry, they will invite
untold misery and mayhem…

1181
01:10:30,333 --> 01:10:32,458
and problems galore from
misunderstandings to miscarriage.

1182
01:10:33,375 --> 01:10:37,416
If they marry, they will have all the
mayhem that a marriage shouldn't bring.

1183
01:10:40,458 --> 01:10:42,125
What's the remedy, Guruji?

1184
01:10:42,625 --> 01:10:45,333
Both father and son should
do a remedial oblation.

1185
01:10:45,916 --> 01:10:46,750
An oblation?!

1186
01:10:47,583 --> 01:10:51,208
The boy should anoint a copper plate
with sacred mantras on the entrance,

1187
01:10:51,916 --> 01:10:53,916
chant the hymn <i>Mahamrutyunjaya mantra</i>,

1188
01:10:55,458 --> 01:11:00,125
donate clothes, food, and a cow to
brahmin priests and the cow dung…

1189
01:11:00,666 --> 01:11:02,166
And plaster the cow
dung on the wall, right?

1190
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:06,416
I don't care about you, but I
am not approving of this marriage.

1191
01:11:08,833 --> 01:11:09,666
Let's leave.

1192
01:11:09,750 --> 01:11:10,875
- Even we want that.
- Dad…

1193
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:11,833
- Let's go, Uncle.
- Sir.

1194
01:11:11,916 --> 01:11:13,708
Don't mind, Guruji.
I am leaving, dear.

1195
01:11:14,083 --> 01:11:15,000
Come, dear.

1196
01:11:15,083 --> 01:11:16,875
- What are you staring at? Come.
- We made a total mess of it.

1197
01:11:24,375 --> 01:11:25,458
Let's go, Uncle.

1198
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,458
Do you see their stupidity?

1199
01:11:36,333 --> 01:11:37,666
Do you still want to marry the girl?

1200
01:11:40,541 --> 01:11:43,583
Even if he had agreed,
I would have never approved it.

1201
01:11:46,166 --> 01:11:47,000
Dad…

1202
01:11:49,208 --> 01:11:50,291
we need no permission from anybody.

1203
01:11:52,708 --> 01:11:54,125
I am going to marry Aradhya…

1204
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:56,333
tomorrow.

1205
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:04,541
So, you are already ready.

1206
01:12:07,625 --> 01:12:08,500
You stop.

1207
01:12:14,791 --> 01:12:15,791
Look, my dear Aradhya.

1208
01:12:19,875 --> 01:12:21,000
I am speaking to you not as a dad…

1209
01:12:22,875 --> 01:12:25,500
but as Chadarangam Srinivas Rao
who's well-versed in scriptures.

1210
01:12:27,041 --> 01:12:29,750
He has a snag in his horoscope

1211
01:12:30,791 --> 01:12:31,958
because of which, your
future happiness is bleak.

1212
01:12:34,625 --> 01:12:36,041
Convince him for an oblation ceremony.

1213
01:12:37,708 --> 01:12:39,125
Or else, you will see hell in marriage.

1214
01:12:40,916 --> 01:12:44,000
I can't force this on him, Dad.

1215
01:12:46,583 --> 01:12:47,875
Viplav is a good boy.

1216
01:12:56,125 --> 01:12:57,833
He will take good care of me.
Just like you.

1217
01:13:00,541 --> 01:13:03,375
- Without him…
- You can't live, right?

1218
01:13:04,375 --> 01:13:05,791
- But you can live without us.
- No, Dad.

1219
01:13:06,166 --> 01:13:07,791
- So, you can be without us.
- Dad, I didn't…

1220
01:13:08,166 --> 01:13:09,000
So, it is fine.

1221
01:13:09,708 --> 01:13:10,583
Did you hear that?

1222
01:13:11,333 --> 01:13:13,375
- Dad, not that, dad.
- That's what you said. It's okay.

1223
01:13:13,750 --> 01:13:15,708
Dear, get that suitcase.
Finished packing?

1224
01:13:15,875 --> 01:13:17,541
Get it now. She will go.

1225
01:13:17,708 --> 01:13:18,916
Uncle, How can we let go like that?

1226
01:13:19,291 --> 01:13:20,416
- Let her go.
- You wait, dear.

1227
01:13:20,666 --> 01:13:22,291
We can explain things to others.

1228
01:13:22,541 --> 01:13:24,208
But some things must
be experienced first-hand.

1229
01:13:24,583 --> 01:13:26,000
She will come back in six months.

1230
01:13:26,375 --> 01:13:27,250
Watch out.

1231
01:13:27,875 --> 01:13:28,708
Uncle, please.

1232
01:13:28,791 --> 01:13:30,958
- Dad, I will stay for a while.
- Okay. You get going.

1233
01:13:31,041 --> 01:13:32,458
Don't worry. Give that to me.

1234
01:13:32,583 --> 01:13:34,458
Listen to me.
Take your laptop.

1235
01:13:34,666 --> 01:13:36,041
- I will stay here for a while, Dad.
- Take that also.

1236
01:13:36,541 --> 01:13:38,375
- Let her go.
- Pandu, listen to me.

1237
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:40,125
You can leave as well.

1238
01:13:40,583 --> 01:13:41,750
Listen to me, son…

1239
01:13:41,833 --> 01:13:43,375
- He is waiting for you.
- Dad.

1240
01:13:43,750 --> 01:13:44,583
Go.

1241
01:14:14,750 --> 01:14:16,083
Is that how a father behaves?

1242
01:14:16,708 --> 01:14:18,916
Why is he cursing his daughter?

1243
01:14:19,333 --> 01:14:21,750
Why is he slamming the door in the face?

1244
01:14:21,958 --> 01:14:25,333
If someone slams the door
on me, I don't bother about them.

1245
01:14:25,416 --> 01:14:26,583
- I don't want my family.
- Hey.

1246
01:14:26,833 --> 01:14:27,833
Then I don't want them either.

1247
01:14:29,250 --> 01:14:31,083
- Let's not take any sides, okay?
- Okay.

1248
01:14:31,375 --> 01:14:32,666
Okay. Let's not take sides.

1249
01:14:34,166 --> 01:14:37,791
Let's prove to the world
what an ideal couple we are.

1250
01:14:38,291 --> 01:14:39,125
Yes, we'll show it them.

1251
01:14:39,416 --> 01:14:40,250
We'll show it to them.

1252
01:14:40,583 --> 01:14:41,541
We will.

1253
01:15:01,791 --> 01:15:02,625
We will prove it to them.

1254
01:15:05,625 --> 01:15:06,458
We will prove it to them.

1255
01:15:08,166 --> 01:15:10,000
We will prove it to them.

1256
01:15:11,250 --> 01:15:12,208
We will prove it to them.

1257
01:15:12,916 --> 01:15:14,958
We will show it to all who
believe in horoscopes.

1258
01:15:15,291 --> 01:15:16,458
And to your dad.

1259
01:15:16,708 --> 01:15:18,166
And to those disbelievers.

1260
01:15:18,791 --> 01:15:21,375
- We'll show to everybody.
- Let's show the world.

1261
01:15:27,875 --> 01:15:28,708
Viplav.

1262
01:15:30,458 --> 01:15:31,291
What happened?

1263
01:15:37,416 --> 01:15:38,250
A black cat.

1264
01:15:40,083 --> 01:15:40,916
So, what?

1265
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:42,875
Bad omen.

1266
01:15:43,958 --> 01:15:44,791
What is it?

1267
01:15:45,416 --> 01:15:46,458
We shouldn't leave immediately, Viplav.

1268
01:15:50,666 --> 01:15:54,041
Shall we stop for two minutes and go?

1269
01:15:55,041 --> 01:15:55,916
Okay?

1270
01:16:13,750 --> 01:16:14,625
{\an8}Everybody, clap!

1271
01:16:18,416 --> 01:16:20,166
{\an8}- Who are the witnesses?
- Myself.

1272
01:16:22,750 --> 01:16:24,500
I hope you'll take good care of her.

1273
01:16:25,375 --> 01:16:26,416
Ma'am?! Me?

1274
01:16:26,541 --> 01:16:27,416
I know he will take care of me.

1275
01:16:28,208 --> 01:16:29,541
Look at how she's relying on you.

1276
01:16:32,333 --> 01:16:35,958
Now that you're married,
what will you call our boy?

1277
01:16:36,458 --> 01:16:37,291
Hello, husband!

1278
01:16:37,458 --> 01:16:41,083
- Oh. That's so boring. What's this?
- Boring.

1279
01:16:41,458 --> 01:16:42,291
Viplav!

1280
01:16:42,375 --> 01:16:43,875
- That's what I call him.
- Correct!

1281
01:16:44,416 --> 01:16:45,791
Anything else, Aradhya?

1282
01:16:48,458 --> 01:16:49,458
Kanna.

1283
01:16:49,666 --> 01:16:50,583
Kanna!

1284
01:16:50,708 --> 01:16:52,000
That's so cute.

1285
01:16:52,083 --> 01:16:53,041
Did you eat anything, Kanna?

1286
01:16:53,166 --> 01:16:55,041
Kanna!

1287
01:16:57,291 --> 01:17:00,291
Hey, the wedding is over.
What about the party, Pushpa?

1288
01:17:00,666 --> 01:17:02,208
Nobody should be seen around

1289
01:17:02,291 --> 01:17:04,208
- for the next three days!
- Viplav!

1290
01:17:06,375 --> 01:17:08,625
<i>The most improbable marriage between</i>
<i>the son of noted atheist Mr. Lenin Satyam…</i>

1291
01:17:08,916 --> 01:17:12,041
<i>and the daughter of a famous Hindu</i>
<i>speaker Mr. Chadarangam Srinivasa Rao</i>

1292
01:17:12,166 --> 01:17:14,541
<i>happened at the registrar's office today…</i>

1293
01:17:14,708 --> 01:17:16,625
<i>Look they are coming here!</i>

1294
01:17:16,708 --> 01:17:17,875
- <i>Hail for…</i>
- <i>Viplav!</i>

1295
01:17:18,041 --> 01:17:19,583
<i>Do your parents know about your marriage?</i>

1296
01:17:19,750 --> 01:17:21,541
<i>Or did you alienate your</i>
<i>parents for this marriage?</i>

1297
01:17:21,708 --> 01:17:22,916
<i>We didn't alienate them.</i>

1298
01:17:23,125 --> 01:17:25,333
<i>Okay, but what if both of you</i>
<i>spar in future like your parents?</i>

1299
01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:33,625
- <i>We don't want to give such a chance…</i>
- <i>Then how will you manage?</i>

1300
01:17:34,875 --> 01:17:35,833
<i>With love.</i>

1301
01:17:37,250 --> 01:17:41,083
Do you see any remorse
on her face, Uncle?

1302
01:17:41,375 --> 01:17:44,000
You better keep your mouth shut.

1303
01:17:45,083 --> 01:17:48,375
Pandu, if you keep these aspersions aside,

1304
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,041
they both look lovely as a pair.

1305
01:17:51,125 --> 01:17:52,916
Then, why don't you divvy
them up with some lighting?

1306
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:57,000
This won't last long.

1307
01:17:57,833 --> 01:17:59,458
Uncle did mention about the
defect in the boy's horoscope.

1308
01:18:00,041 --> 01:18:04,000
Both the uncles will forget all
their differences to cradle the babies…

1309
01:18:13,041 --> 01:18:14,875
Thomas cooks tasty biryani.

1310
01:18:16,166 --> 01:18:18,750
But nobody knows the secret recipe.

1311
01:18:18,958 --> 01:18:22,666
Hey, I will share. Let me tell you…

1312
01:18:24,791 --> 01:18:25,750
Viplavam?

1313
01:18:25,833 --> 01:18:27,583
- Viplav.
- Sorry, Viplav.

1314
01:18:28,208 --> 01:18:29,041
Viplav.

1315
01:18:29,666 --> 01:18:34,708
<i>I wanted to surprise Zoya on the day of</i>
<i>our marriage with biryani made with love.</i>

1316
01:18:35,416 --> 01:18:40,708
That's it! I stopped cooking since then.

1317
01:18:42,916 --> 01:18:46,750
- Can you cook, Aradhya?
- What are you talking, ma'am?

1318
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:51,416
- Aradhya makes amazing <i>puliogare</i>?
- Hey!

1319
01:18:51,541 --> 01:18:55,250
It's the best <i>puliogare</i> I ate
in the whole of Annavaram.

1320
01:18:56,125 --> 01:18:57,625
The credit goes to her family.

1321
01:18:57,708 --> 01:18:58,750
Wow.

1322
01:18:59,125 --> 01:19:01,541
Aradhya, you can learn
culinary skills from Thomas.

1323
01:19:02,291 --> 01:19:04,333
And then you can order Viplav
to do your bidding because

1324
01:19:04,416 --> 01:19:06,583
he will literally eat out
of your hands after that.

1325
01:19:08,625 --> 01:19:09,916
Do you both stay here?

1326
01:19:12,583 --> 01:19:14,583
Yes, we have a daughter, Lissy.

1327
01:19:15,166 --> 01:19:17,083
She stays in our native place Alleppey.

1328
01:19:17,583 --> 01:19:20,666
She loves nature, and silence.

1329
01:19:20,750 --> 01:19:23,166
We go there to meet her
on her birthday every year.

1330
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:24,833
Have it…

1331
01:19:24,958 --> 01:19:26,833
Serve them some biryani!

1332
01:19:32,125 --> 01:19:33,333
What are you doing?

1333
01:19:34,958 --> 01:19:36,291
Are you done?

1334
01:19:38,833 --> 01:19:40,291
Did you like it, Aradhya?

1335
01:19:42,458 --> 01:19:43,375
Take it home.

1336
01:19:44,125 --> 01:19:45,125
Aradhya, shall we leave?

1337
01:19:46,083 --> 01:19:49,041
Viplav, why do you
go to that old quarters?

1338
01:19:49,166 --> 01:19:52,291
It smells of fresh paint.
Why don't you stay back?

1339
01:19:53,041 --> 01:19:55,333
We don't want to disturb you.

1340
01:19:55,416 --> 01:19:57,166
That's all right.
We will manage.

1341
01:19:57,250 --> 01:19:58,958
The mosquitoes won't let you sleep!

1342
01:19:59,333 --> 01:20:01,500
Please give us the mosquito
coil, ma'am! We are used to it.

1343
01:20:01,583 --> 01:20:03,208
Why do you have to suffer?

1344
01:20:03,291 --> 01:20:07,125
Ma'am, just spare us a pillow
and a quilt. We'll manage it.

1345
01:20:07,875 --> 01:20:10,416
Hey, let them go.

1346
01:20:13,916 --> 01:20:14,791
Okay.

1347
01:20:15,666 --> 01:20:16,583
Hey, why did you say that?

1348
01:20:16,666 --> 01:20:18,083
Only then will our work go smoothly.

1349
01:20:26,500 --> 01:20:28,333
Whichever leg we use
to step inside the house

1350
01:20:28,541 --> 01:20:30,375
it's going to
offend one of our dads.

1351
01:20:30,458 --> 01:20:31,458
What should we do?

1352
01:20:35,041 --> 01:20:37,000
I won't allow you to keep
your leg on the floor at all!

1353
01:20:39,458 --> 01:20:40,500
<i>You are my sunshine</i>

1354
01:20:40,583 --> 01:20:41,583
<i>You are my moonlight</i>

1355
01:20:41,708 --> 01:20:43,833
<i>You are the stars in the sky</i>

1356
01:20:44,291 --> 01:20:45,916
<i>Come with me now</i>

1357
01:20:46,166 --> 01:20:48,208
<i>You have my desire</i>

1358
01:20:48,666 --> 01:20:50,291
<i>Come along</i>

1359
01:20:50,833 --> 01:20:55,041
<i>Just the way you are Aradhya</i>

1360
01:20:56,083 --> 01:20:59,916
<i>Waltzing towards you</i>

1361
01:21:00,666 --> 01:21:04,375
<i>The gait is yours</i>

1362
01:21:05,083 --> 01:21:08,333
<i>The body draped itself</i>

1363
01:21:08,666 --> 01:21:11,916
<i>Take hold of it</i>

1364
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,083
<i>Heartfelt thoughts</i>
<i>My beloved star!</i>

1365
01:21:17,250 --> 01:21:19,750
<i>You plundered my heart</i>

1366
01:21:19,833 --> 01:21:22,583
<i>And looted the sandalwood beneath</i>

1367
01:21:23,708 --> 01:21:25,583
- <i>Amidst a multitude of festivals</i>
- Hi, Viplav!

1368
01:21:25,666 --> 01:21:27,541
Viplav, I will get you some coffee.

1369
01:21:28,708 --> 01:21:32,791
<i>Aradhya… Aradhya…</i>

1370
01:21:33,125 --> 01:21:37,333
<i>Seek nothing else but you</i>

1371
01:21:37,541 --> 01:21:41,708
<i>Aradhya… Aradhya…</i>

1372
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,791
<i>Seek nothing else but you</i>

1373
01:22:30,875 --> 01:22:35,166
<i>Let my song reach you now</i>

1374
01:22:35,250 --> 01:22:38,416
<i>While this game of neck embrace is on</i>

1375
01:22:39,750 --> 01:22:43,875
<i>Who wins at the last</i>

1376
01:22:43,958 --> 01:22:47,208
<i>Is not clear to us</i>

1377
01:22:48,708 --> 01:22:55,666
<i>This moment… should last…</i>

1378
01:22:57,375 --> 01:23:00,000
<i>With you</i>

1379
01:23:01,958 --> 01:23:05,875
<i>which knows no bounds or shore!</i>

1380
01:23:06,458 --> 01:23:10,791
<i>Aradhya… Aradhya…</i>

1381
01:23:10,916 --> 01:23:14,875
<i>I seek nothing else but you</i>

1382
01:23:15,375 --> 01:23:19,458
<i>Aradhya… Aradhya…</i>

1383
01:23:19,750 --> 01:23:23,875
<i>I seek nothing else but you</i>

1384
01:23:50,833 --> 01:23:55,250
<i>Yearning to say something</i>
<i>And listen to your words</i>

1385
01:23:55,333 --> 01:23:58,583
<i>At every turn of your imagination</i>

1386
01:23:59,833 --> 01:24:04,125
<i>What's within my grasp</i>
<i>Is what I adore a lot</i>

1387
01:24:04,208 --> 01:24:07,250
<i>Thanks to your loving provocations</i>

1388
01:24:08,708 --> 01:24:12,833
<i>Just like you</i>

1389
01:24:12,916 --> 01:24:15,708
<i>I'm transformed…</i>

1390
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:21,291
<i>I must say</i>

1391
01:24:21,958 --> 01:24:26,000
<i>Can't see you and I as different</i>

1392
01:24:26,083 --> 01:24:28,291
<i>Heartfelt thoughts</i>
<i>My beloved star!</i>

1393
01:24:28,375 --> 01:24:30,875
<i>You plundered my heart</i>

1394
01:24:30,958 --> 01:24:33,791
<i>And looted the sandalwood beneath</i>

1395
01:24:35,041 --> 01:24:39,750
<i>Amidst a multitude of festivals</i>
<i>The full moonlight shines through</i>

1396
01:24:39,833 --> 01:24:43,958
<i>Aradhya… Aradhya…</i>

1397
01:24:44,291 --> 01:24:48,250
<i>I seek nothing else but you</i>

1398
01:24:48,666 --> 01:24:52,833
<i>Aradhya… Aradhya…</i>

1399
01:24:53,125 --> 01:24:57,208
<i>I seek nothing else but you</i>

1400
01:26:23,458 --> 01:26:24,375
Okay?

1401
01:26:32,958 --> 01:26:34,791
I need a baby Aradhya.

1402
01:26:36,125 --> 01:26:39,500
With the same features.

1403
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:42,541
No, not with my nose. I like your nose.

1404
01:26:43,416 --> 01:26:44,416
She should resemble you…

1405
01:26:45,041 --> 01:26:47,500
She should be as tall as me
and should be brainy like me.

1406
01:26:50,375 --> 01:26:52,166
If she's as tall as you, it's difficult
to get a boy for marriage.

1407
01:26:53,458 --> 01:26:56,041
Boys are bad!

1408
01:26:56,583 --> 01:26:58,250
I won't let anyone of them get near her.

1409
01:26:58,750 --> 01:27:00,000
Look who's talking!

1410
01:27:01,375 --> 01:27:02,541
She'll always be with us.

1411
01:27:09,083 --> 01:27:09,916
{\an8}Hi.

1412
01:27:10,541 --> 01:27:12,416
{\an8}Doctor, how's the baby?

1413
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:14,750
{\an8}Does she bear the same
features as Aradhya?

1414
01:27:16,750 --> 01:27:17,666
{\an8}We can't say that now.

1415
01:27:17,833 --> 01:27:19,208
Why are you whispering, doctor?

1416
01:27:19,291 --> 01:27:21,666
Say it aloud! Everyone in Kakinada
should also come to know about it.

1417
01:27:21,916 --> 01:27:22,791
Kanna!

1418
01:27:23,541 --> 01:27:27,208
Dear, such things are common
in a seven-week pregnancy.

1419
01:27:28,083 --> 01:27:29,041
What's common, doctor?

1420
01:27:29,500 --> 01:27:31,625
Don't make me tense.
Just tell me what's wrong.

1421
01:27:32,708 --> 01:27:33,708
It's a miscarriage.

1422
01:27:39,083 --> 01:27:40,333
Baby's heart is not beating.

1423
01:27:43,708 --> 01:27:47,875
Is there a history of any
miscarriage in your family?

1424
01:27:51,708 --> 01:27:53,333
But the pregnancy kit
shows that she is pregnant.

1425
01:27:53,708 --> 01:27:56,375
The pregnancy kit claims it
but the scan shows the actual report.

1426
01:27:56,458 --> 01:27:59,416
- Is your scanning machine working?
- Of course!

1427
01:28:01,458 --> 01:28:03,541
Hey, Aradhya.

1428
01:28:04,416 --> 01:28:05,833
Don't cry.

1429
01:28:07,333 --> 01:28:09,291
We can still go to
better hospitals.

1430
01:28:09,458 --> 01:28:12,208
We'll get another opinion
from better doctors.

1431
01:28:13,291 --> 01:28:14,916
- Excuse me.
- Please don't cry.

1432
01:28:15,708 --> 01:28:17,958
You'll get the same reports everywhere.

1433
01:28:18,250 --> 01:28:19,791
We have to for MTP.

1434
01:28:20,916 --> 01:28:23,041
- MTP means?
- It's a cleaning procedure.

1435
01:28:33,333 --> 01:28:35,416
It's a good time to sign the documents.

1436
01:28:35,583 --> 01:28:37,041
You will be settled for life.

1437
01:28:41,291 --> 01:28:42,208
Hello, who is this?

1438
01:28:42,666 --> 01:28:43,583
Mr. Shanmukh.

1439
01:28:43,666 --> 01:28:47,291
You're going to become an uncle
to Viplav's soon-to-be-born child.

1440
01:28:48,041 --> 01:28:51,625
<i>So, tell your uncle</i>
<i>to junk the horoscopes.</i>

1441
01:28:51,750 --> 01:28:53,291
<i>Okay? Bless you.</i>

1442
01:28:55,875 --> 01:28:56,875
Dude…

1443
01:28:58,416 --> 01:29:00,250
- In one year…
- RK!

1444
01:29:01,541 --> 01:29:03,458
What happened, dude?
Why are you so dull, sister?

1445
01:29:06,625 --> 01:29:08,166
RK, do we need kids so soon?

1446
01:29:09,708 --> 01:29:11,333
It's been only a year.

1447
01:29:12,541 --> 01:29:15,458
We have so much more to do in life.

1448
01:29:17,583 --> 01:29:19,458
Don't we both need our personal space?

1449
01:29:20,791 --> 01:29:23,750
Luckily, the doctor said that she's
not pregnant.

1450
01:29:23,916 --> 01:29:24,750
What?

1451
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:28,458
What about the sweets?

1452
01:29:29,125 --> 01:29:30,041
Distribute to everyone.

1453
01:29:31,583 --> 01:29:32,916
Does he want me to distribute it?

1454
01:29:36,708 --> 01:29:38,916
Viplav, all this happened because
we didn't do that oblation.

1455
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:42,333
Aradhya, didn't the doctor
say this is quite normal?

1456
01:29:43,541 --> 01:29:44,791
That's not a problem.

1457
01:29:47,333 --> 01:29:48,458
Shall I tell you something?

1458
01:29:48,875 --> 01:29:52,875
This is the time to be strong.
Everything will be fine. Okay?

1459
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:05,875
Uncle…

1460
01:30:09,583 --> 01:30:10,750
Aradhya is pregnant.

1461
01:30:12,750 --> 01:30:15,083
Did you hear the news?
Aradhya is pregnant.

1462
01:30:16,625 --> 01:30:20,750
Didn't you tell us that the defect in
their horoscope will not get her pregnant?

1463
01:30:21,625 --> 01:30:23,791
In less than a year, they
proved your shastras wrong.

1464
01:30:24,208 --> 01:30:26,291
How do we face that Satyam now?

1465
01:30:27,875 --> 01:30:31,250
I was shocked when I heard about
Aradhya's pregnancy!

1466
01:30:31,458 --> 01:30:32,416
Just shut up.

1467
01:30:34,708 --> 01:30:36,541
There's no end to your horrible talk.

1468
01:30:37,416 --> 01:30:40,500
Shame on you to wish
ill for your niece like that.

1469
01:30:42,291 --> 01:30:46,416
The horoscope cannot dictate the
destiny that can be altered by the self.

1470
01:30:47,416 --> 01:30:50,666
Aradhya is lucky.
Let's go see her once, Pandu.

1471
01:30:54,875 --> 01:31:00,000
If her mother were alive, she
would have rushed immediately.

1472
01:31:02,916 --> 01:31:05,250
Let's go, son.

1473
01:31:13,625 --> 01:31:14,541
What's the matter?

1474
01:31:17,875 --> 01:31:19,625
I can't stop thinking about it, Thomas.

1475
01:31:20,833 --> 01:31:24,375
My feet trembled when
the doctor broke the news.

1476
01:31:25,541 --> 01:31:26,875
It blanked me out.

1477
01:31:30,125 --> 01:31:33,083
Zoya and I didn't want
to have kids for two years.

1478
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:35,458
Later, Lissy was born.

1479
01:31:37,041 --> 01:31:41,041
But those two years were
the best time of our lives!

1480
01:31:42,291 --> 01:31:43,291
Put it.

1481
01:31:45,375 --> 01:31:47,958
You are still recently married.

1482
01:31:52,875 --> 01:31:58,291
You must enjoy every
moment of your lives.

1483
01:31:58,375 --> 01:32:03,625
Otherwise, Viplav will keep
devouring that lemon rice etc.

1484
01:32:03,916 --> 01:32:04,916
That fish.

1485
01:32:09,291 --> 01:32:10,708
One piece of fish.

1486
01:32:14,583 --> 01:32:15,416
Thank you.

1487
01:32:44,416 --> 01:32:45,333
Kanna.

1488
01:32:49,208 --> 01:32:51,083
Father? Is everything fine?

1489
01:32:51,750 --> 01:32:52,875
How are you, dear?

1490
01:32:54,333 --> 01:32:55,666
I can smell fish curry here!

1491
01:32:55,750 --> 01:32:57,833
You must be careful now, dear.

1492
01:32:58,291 --> 01:33:01,083
You always thought I didn't do enough.

1493
01:33:01,833 --> 01:33:06,000
Well, I convinced your dad to come here!

1494
01:33:11,250 --> 01:33:12,250
Uncle, look around!

1495
01:33:12,750 --> 01:33:15,875
There's no photo of any deity
or even a basil plant.

1496
01:33:17,375 --> 01:33:21,333
Look there, they put liquor bottles in the
most auspicious direction of the house.

1497
01:33:21,958 --> 01:33:24,916
He has done it.
He has converted Aradhya like him.

1498
01:33:25,458 --> 01:33:27,458
They have started
eating fish curry as well.

1499
01:33:27,708 --> 01:33:29,583
What a blasphemy!

1500
01:33:29,666 --> 01:33:33,500
Oh, no, Dad. Our neighbors
are from Bheemavaram.

1501
01:33:33,583 --> 01:33:34,916
They cook fish day and night.

1502
01:33:35,875 --> 01:33:37,583
Did you see how she covered it up?

1503
01:33:39,375 --> 01:33:40,833
He saw it.

1504
01:33:43,250 --> 01:33:44,875
Why don't you freshen up, Dad?

1505
01:33:48,916 --> 01:33:50,708
Where's the marriage photo?

1506
01:33:58,750 --> 01:33:59,666
My dear!

1507
01:34:00,083 --> 01:34:00,958
Come to me.

1508
01:34:05,083 --> 01:34:07,416
- Hey, RK, what are you doing here?
- Your dad is here.

1509
01:34:08,166 --> 01:34:09,166
- My dad?
- Yes.

1510
01:34:11,291 --> 01:34:12,125
Why?

1511
01:34:12,250 --> 01:34:14,791
He wants to congratulate you
on the verge of becoming a dad.

1512
01:34:15,791 --> 01:34:17,000
How did he come to know?

1513
01:34:17,291 --> 01:34:19,666
I couldn't hold the
news and told him, dude.

1514
01:34:19,750 --> 01:34:21,250
You can't even hold urine for long, man.

1515
01:34:21,333 --> 01:34:22,541
Forget that, dude.

1516
01:34:22,625 --> 01:34:26,083
Even your dad is unable
to contain himself here.

1517
01:34:27,458 --> 01:34:28,333
Watch the spectacle!

1518
01:34:36,041 --> 01:34:38,250
- What is this?
- You know your dad better.

1519
01:34:38,375 --> 01:34:40,416
- Come on, beat it harder and louder.
- My son is here.

1520
01:34:40,500 --> 01:34:41,750
- What is all this, Mom?
- Hey, Viplav.

1521
01:34:41,833 --> 01:34:42,833
You are going to be a dad, right?

1522
01:34:43,958 --> 01:34:45,500
My dear son!

1523
01:34:45,666 --> 01:34:47,375
You kept our flag flying high.

1524
01:34:51,833 --> 01:34:53,083
Well done, Viplav.

1525
01:34:53,458 --> 01:34:56,125
Chadarangam will hang himself
if he comes to know about this news.

1526
01:34:56,583 --> 01:35:00,166
My cute son! I can't believe
you're going to be a dad.

1527
01:35:00,250 --> 01:35:01,583
Even he can't believe it.

1528
01:35:01,666 --> 01:35:02,916
He can't believe it either.

1529
01:35:03,583 --> 01:35:04,416
Look, Viplav.

1530
01:35:04,750 --> 01:35:06,000
That Chadarangam family

1531
01:35:06,208 --> 01:35:09,416
is capable of rubbing all their
orthodoxy on the unborn child too.

1532
01:35:09,791 --> 01:35:11,333
Stay away from all that.

1533
01:35:12,416 --> 01:35:13,625
Don't worry about that, Dad.

1534
01:35:13,916 --> 01:35:15,291
Aradhya is a good girl.

1535
01:35:15,833 --> 01:35:18,458
She has even learned to cook
fish curry for me.

1536
01:35:18,708 --> 01:35:21,458
A fish curry by Chadarangam's daughter!

1537
01:35:23,083 --> 01:35:24,958
He's my son!

1538
01:35:25,333 --> 01:35:26,333
Really?

1539
01:35:27,208 --> 01:35:28,333
Auntie, you can't believe, right?

1540
01:35:28,416 --> 01:35:30,541
Hey, call Aradhya right now
and put it on the speaker.

1541
01:35:30,625 --> 01:35:32,916
Son, please call your
daughter-in-law once.

1542
01:35:37,833 --> 01:35:39,166
- Viplav!
- Aradhya!

1543
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:43,125
Mom and dad are coming home, can
you cook fish curry for all of them?

1544
01:35:43,583 --> 01:35:46,583
That's not possible!
Even my dad and mom are here.

1545
01:35:47,541 --> 01:35:50,250
<i>I feel numb and can't think</i>
<i>of anything. Where are you?</i>

1546
01:35:50,333 --> 01:35:51,208
Aradhya…

1547
01:35:52,916 --> 01:35:53,791
I am coming, Dad.

1548
01:35:54,250 --> 01:35:55,208
Aradhya!

1549
01:35:57,458 --> 01:35:58,291
Got him!

1550
01:35:59,541 --> 01:36:00,625
Pandu…

1551
01:36:01,916 --> 01:36:05,833
we're fortunate that Aradhya
is following our traditions.

1552
01:36:06,250 --> 01:36:08,500
Why don't you talk to her?

1553
01:36:08,791 --> 01:36:10,250
Just go and speak to her.

1554
01:36:11,125 --> 01:36:12,000
Pandu.

1555
01:36:13,250 --> 01:36:14,875
Talk to her.

1556
01:36:16,125 --> 01:36:18,625
- Hello, Mr. Chadarangam.
- Greetings.

1557
01:36:20,458 --> 01:36:22,541
- A great man said…
- How are you?

1558
01:36:22,625 --> 01:36:26,291
that you must do
oblations to beget children

1559
01:36:27,208 --> 01:36:31,541
and some nonsense about cows etc.

1560
01:36:32,541 --> 01:36:34,166
Now Viplav and Aradhya are soon

1561
01:36:34,250 --> 01:36:36,458
going to be parents
without any of these rituals.

1562
01:36:37,083 --> 01:36:38,000
Mr. Chadarangam.

1563
01:36:38,958 --> 01:36:42,791
There is a science behind
an apple falling from the tree.

1564
01:36:43,375 --> 01:36:44,833
It's called the law of gravity!

1565
01:36:45,333 --> 01:36:48,041
There is a science
behind a woman conceiving.

1566
01:36:48,125 --> 01:36:49,666
It's called the reproductive science.

1567
01:36:50,291 --> 01:36:53,875
It is something not ordained by
Gods or the shastras you believe in.

1568
01:36:54,458 --> 01:36:57,000
Admit defeat if you
have any iota of shame

1569
01:36:57,750 --> 01:36:59,916
and stay away from the to-be-born child.

1570
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,791
Sir, he was just joking--

1571
01:37:03,333 --> 01:37:06,666
Otherwise, wipe that
sacred ash and be like us.

1572
01:37:07,541 --> 01:37:09,166
- Uncle…
- Let me finish.

1573
01:37:09,416 --> 01:37:10,541
- Uncle, that's not right.
- Ara…

1574
01:37:15,958 --> 01:37:17,041
It's a miscarriage.

1575
01:37:21,125 --> 01:37:23,125
What? Oh, no!

1576
01:37:26,041 --> 01:37:27,041
What, dear?

1577
01:37:29,583 --> 01:37:31,291
What are you saying?

1578
01:37:31,375 --> 01:37:32,875
The fetus couldn't survive, Grandma!

1579
01:37:33,791 --> 01:37:35,958
My dear!
Oh, my dear!

1580
01:37:42,583 --> 01:37:43,458
Mr. Satyam…

1581
01:37:45,416 --> 01:37:48,583
You said something a while ago.
Science, my foot!

1582
01:37:50,708 --> 01:37:52,791
That there's a science
behind an apple falling…

1583
01:37:54,208 --> 01:37:56,500
and that there's a science
behind a healthy baby's birth.

1584
01:37:58,416 --> 01:38:01,833
But nothing happens without
the five elements of nature.

1585
01:38:03,875 --> 01:38:05,541
Science is born out of creation.

1586
01:38:06,875 --> 01:38:08,750
Creation is not born out of science.

1587
01:38:09,541 --> 01:38:12,541
- Look--
- Folks like you won't get it. Leave it.

1588
01:38:24,291 --> 01:38:26,458
You will only conceive if
an oblation is performed.

1589
01:38:28,291 --> 01:38:30,375
I am saying this as your well-wisher dad…

1590
01:38:32,208 --> 01:38:34,583
and not as Chadarangam Srinivasa Rao.

1591
01:38:50,083 --> 01:38:51,250
Let me console him, Uncle.

1592
01:38:51,541 --> 01:38:52,666
Come…

1593
01:38:53,375 --> 01:38:54,541
Take care of her.

1594
01:39:08,333 --> 01:39:09,166
Kanna!

1595
01:39:10,333 --> 01:39:12,000
Why did you rush to tell them the truth?

1596
01:39:14,500 --> 01:39:15,958
You could have withheld for a day.

1597
01:39:16,416 --> 01:39:19,083
- Are you angry with me?
- Not that, Aradhya.

1598
01:39:21,833 --> 01:39:24,250
Use your brains, sometimes.
You can't get emotional all the time.

1599
01:39:26,625 --> 01:39:28,000
Kanna, just listen to me--

1600
01:39:52,208 --> 01:39:53,125
Did you notice?

1601
01:39:54,416 --> 01:39:56,916
Yesterday was the first night
we missed having it.

1602
01:39:59,958 --> 01:40:00,958
You're looking fresh, baby.

1603
01:40:02,708 --> 01:40:03,708
What do you mean?

1604
01:40:04,750 --> 01:40:06,583
I've been crying the whole night, Viplav.

1605
01:40:06,791 --> 01:40:07,750
What happened, dear?

1606
01:40:09,791 --> 01:40:11,208
Why did you slam the door on me?

1607
01:40:12,083 --> 01:40:14,083
I didn't slam the door on you.

1608
01:40:15,041 --> 01:40:16,708
I let it slide slowly.

1609
01:40:17,083 --> 01:40:18,166
I am speaking--

1610
01:40:19,708 --> 01:40:22,166
- You deliberately did it.
- Hey, Aradhya, I mean it.

1611
01:40:24,166 --> 01:40:27,791
Why didn't you utter a word when
your dad verbally abused my dad?

1612
01:40:29,583 --> 01:40:31,875
Well, didn't we decide
not to take any sides?

1613
01:40:33,708 --> 01:40:36,041
Being silent also
tantamount to taking sides.

1614
01:40:36,666 --> 01:40:38,666
You were sleeping like a log.

1615
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:40,458
What if I had taken an extreme step?

1616
01:40:41,625 --> 01:40:43,041
What if I had taken an extreme step?

1617
01:40:43,125 --> 01:40:44,750
Aradhya, why are you getting worked up?

1618
01:40:45,666 --> 01:40:47,750
You don't know what happened, ma'am.

1619
01:40:48,041 --> 01:40:50,500
Ma'am, we want to stay
away from both the sides.

1620
01:40:51,041 --> 01:40:53,041
How can I scold my dad
in front of her dad?

1621
01:40:53,250 --> 01:40:54,583
I didn't ask you to scold him.

1622
01:40:55,541 --> 01:40:56,708
I said you could've stopped.

1623
01:40:58,166 --> 01:40:59,500
Well, you stopped it
all by telling the truth.

1624
01:41:00,708 --> 01:41:02,250
As if you never lied to anyone.

1625
01:41:02,416 --> 01:41:03,916
What did I lie?

1626
01:41:04,583 --> 01:41:05,541
Forget it now.

1627
01:41:07,166 --> 01:41:08,208
It's okay, tell me.

1628
01:41:09,041 --> 01:41:10,083
When did I lie to you?

1629
01:41:11,041 --> 01:41:11,916
Pakistan.

1630
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:13,833
Feroze.

1631
01:41:14,916 --> 01:41:15,750
Terrorist camp.

1632
01:41:17,083 --> 01:41:18,416
She has lied to me as well, ma'am.

1633
01:41:19,541 --> 01:41:22,041
I was large-hearted
enough to accommodate her.

1634
01:41:22,500 --> 01:41:23,583
Stop it, Viplav.

1635
01:41:24,750 --> 01:41:27,083
Let's discuss later.
It's getting late for office.

1636
01:41:27,166 --> 01:41:28,750
Yes, I told all lies.

1637
01:41:30,458 --> 01:41:34,500
I should have also lied that I didn't love
you, would have saved all this labor.

1638
01:41:37,166 --> 01:41:40,125
I deserve this for
leaving everything for you.

1639
01:41:40,500 --> 01:41:42,291
Why are you behaving like a kid?

1640
01:41:42,666 --> 01:41:47,250
Is it right for you to intrude when wife
and husband are arguing?

1641
01:41:49,166 --> 01:41:50,000
Hey…

1642
01:41:51,125 --> 01:41:52,625
why are you venting out on her?

1643
01:41:53,791 --> 01:41:54,625
You calm down.

1644
01:41:54,833 --> 01:41:55,666
Apologize to her.

1645
01:41:55,916 --> 01:41:57,166
Why should she say sorry to me?

1646
01:41:57,708 --> 01:42:00,125
Don't bother, dear.
Let's go to office now.

1647
01:42:03,250 --> 01:42:04,208
Please apologize to her, Aradhya.

1648
01:42:09,833 --> 01:42:10,791
Sorry, ma'am.

1649
01:42:15,750 --> 01:42:16,625
Viplav…

1650
01:42:24,458 --> 01:42:27,708
Aradhya is a girl with self-esteem.
She is hurt for sure.

1651
01:42:27,916 --> 01:42:30,125
Let it be, ma'am.
Nothing will happen.

1652
01:42:30,375 --> 01:42:32,416
{\an8}She said she erred in trusting you.

1653
01:42:32,666 --> 01:42:34,166
That's an uneasy
feeling for any girl to get.

1654
01:42:34,375 --> 01:42:36,916
Ma'am, we should
keep them in their limits.

1655
01:42:37,625 --> 01:42:38,833
Hey, stop.

1656
01:42:40,125 --> 01:42:41,000
What happened, ma'am?

1657
01:42:41,500 --> 01:42:42,333
Get down.

1658
01:42:43,958 --> 01:42:44,791
What did you say?

1659
01:42:44,875 --> 01:42:47,875
We should keep them in their limits.

1660
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,458
That applies to all the women, right?

1661
01:42:50,958 --> 01:42:56,083
That coconut seller, Aradhya,
myself, everyone, right?

1662
01:42:56,333 --> 01:42:58,500
What is the connection with
that coconut seller, ma'am?

1663
01:42:58,583 --> 01:42:59,500
Well, didn't you just say it?

1664
01:43:00,083 --> 01:43:02,750
Why do you paint every
woman with the same brush?

1665
01:43:03,708 --> 01:43:05,375
You're just like any other male.

1666
01:43:06,375 --> 01:43:07,208
Do one thing.

1667
01:43:07,916 --> 01:43:09,291
Walk to the office.

1668
01:43:10,083 --> 01:43:10,916
Ma'am.

1669
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,750
Yes, just think about what you said.

1670
01:43:15,291 --> 01:43:16,125
Ma'am.

1671
01:43:16,416 --> 01:43:17,666
Don't leave me here, ma'am.

1672
01:43:25,541 --> 01:43:27,041
Why is Aradhya doing this?

1673
01:43:29,291 --> 01:43:30,666
The moment I stepped in…

1674
01:43:31,208 --> 01:43:34,875
she said I slammed the door on her,
and she feels like committing suicide.

1675
01:43:35,583 --> 01:43:37,875
Even I am outside that door now.

1676
01:43:38,333 --> 01:43:39,583
What if I also commit suicide?

1677
01:43:40,083 --> 01:43:41,708
Marriage itself means
writing our own obituary.

1678
01:43:41,875 --> 01:43:44,458
You are a dead meat. RIP…

1679
01:43:44,541 --> 01:43:45,750
Sir, shall I squeeze a lemon?

1680
01:43:45,833 --> 01:43:47,916
Who asked you to barge in like this?

1681
01:43:48,916 --> 01:43:51,750
We're talking about something important.
Get the hell out of here.

1682
01:43:51,958 --> 01:43:52,791
Keep them here and go.

1683
01:43:55,125 --> 01:43:56,625
You should always be kept in your limits.

1684
01:43:56,875 --> 01:43:57,833
You…

1685
01:43:58,458 --> 01:43:59,375
Have you got any shame?

1686
01:44:00,458 --> 01:44:02,875
Why do you talk like a male chauvinist?

1687
01:44:03,625 --> 01:44:04,458
How do we treat women then?

1688
01:44:06,083 --> 01:44:07,375
You should think highly of them, RK!

1689
01:44:07,833 --> 01:44:09,125
Oh.

1690
01:44:09,458 --> 01:44:12,041
Ma'am. Sorry. Please don't mind.

1691
01:44:12,666 --> 01:44:13,666
Please squeeze a lemon.

1692
01:44:14,875 --> 01:44:16,000
Squeeze one for him first.

1693
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:26,000
Hey, wait!

1694
01:44:26,416 --> 01:44:28,291
- Wait!
- How many glasses will you break?

1695
01:44:29,708 --> 01:44:31,208
Why are you scared so much?

1696
01:44:31,916 --> 01:44:33,000
Relax. Come.

1697
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:35,333
What do you think about me?

1698
01:44:37,625 --> 01:44:39,666
People may have their opinions about me.

1699
01:44:40,208 --> 01:44:41,416
But I am a feminist at heart.

1700
01:44:42,708 --> 01:44:44,583
Please sit.

1701
01:44:45,583 --> 01:44:46,416
Sit down.

1702
01:44:51,875 --> 01:44:52,791
Clean yourself.

1703
01:44:56,083 --> 01:44:57,875
Poor Aradhya. I can empathize
how she must be feeling.

1704
01:45:01,125 --> 01:45:04,333
I just wanted to draw her
closer, hug her and say sorry.

1705
01:45:05,166 --> 01:45:07,083
You can still do that.

1706
01:45:07,583 --> 01:45:09,375
Just imagine our maid Lakshmi
to be Aradhya for a moment.

1707
01:45:09,458 --> 01:45:10,541
You can hug her and show your emotions.

1708
01:45:10,625 --> 01:45:12,083
- I will also show my emotions.
- Dirty fellow!

1709
01:45:13,666 --> 01:45:15,041
Aradhya is the only woman
I have in my life.

1710
01:45:16,083 --> 01:45:17,458
Nobody else.

1711
01:45:17,541 --> 01:45:18,416
Okay, sir.

1712
01:45:21,625 --> 01:45:23,500
I can't stand these night shifts.

1713
01:45:24,541 --> 01:45:27,208
What are you wearing for
tomorrow's kick-off party?

1714
01:45:28,208 --> 01:45:29,958
I am not in the mood for it.

1715
01:45:33,833 --> 01:45:35,166
Hey, there's your husband!

1716
01:45:36,666 --> 01:45:37,958
Look, there.

1717
01:45:47,541 --> 01:45:48,458
Aradhya!

1718
01:45:48,666 --> 01:45:49,541
Aradhya!

1719
01:45:59,416 --> 01:46:00,291
Baby.

1720
01:46:01,583 --> 01:46:03,291
Look at your eyes.
They are restless.

1721
01:46:03,458 --> 01:46:04,625
I am going to give up these night shifts.

1722
01:46:04,708 --> 01:46:05,541
Hold this.

1723
01:46:07,958 --> 01:46:08,791
Have this coffee.

1724
01:46:09,500 --> 01:46:10,416
I made it.

1725
01:46:16,750 --> 01:46:18,000
Baby! Hey!

1726
01:46:20,500 --> 01:46:21,625
Baby, have it. Please.

1727
01:46:21,875 --> 01:46:24,375
Dear, do you know him?

1728
01:46:25,208 --> 01:46:26,750
- Yes.
- No.

1729
01:46:27,416 --> 01:46:29,250
- Is this what you do?
- Baby…

1730
01:46:29,458 --> 01:46:31,083
No, Auntie.
I know her.

1731
01:46:31,166 --> 01:46:32,625
Move out. Go and stand over there.

1732
01:46:33,041 --> 01:46:34,541
- Baby, tell her.
- Move.

1733
01:46:35,375 --> 01:46:37,083
- Move.
- Here… Leave.

1734
01:46:37,250 --> 01:46:38,458
Baby, what's happening?

1735
01:46:50,250 --> 01:46:53,458
If you hadn't caught the ball,
we would have lost the game.

1736
01:46:54,250 --> 01:46:57,500
We won it because Appu
hit a six off the last ball.

1737
01:46:58,583 --> 01:47:00,291
- Girl, shall I play? I play well.
- Hey!

1738
01:47:00,500 --> 01:47:01,833
I bet you'll like what I play. Listen…

1739
01:47:01,916 --> 01:47:03,208
And he wants to bowl.

1740
01:47:03,333 --> 01:47:05,583
<i>What else do we need?</i>

1741
01:47:06,458 --> 01:47:09,083
<i>Enough</i>
<i>That's enough</i>

1742
01:47:10,041 --> 01:47:12,875
<i>What else do we need?</i>

1743
01:47:13,083 --> 01:47:15,833
<i>Enough</i>
<i>That's enough</i>

1744
01:47:15,916 --> 01:47:16,750
Hey, give it back.

1745
01:47:17,208 --> 01:47:18,541
Do you want me to call the police?

1746
01:47:19,375 --> 01:47:21,250
Hey, the teacher is upset.

1747
01:47:22,833 --> 01:47:25,166
Guys, it's finals tomorrow.
Let's be serious about it.

1748
01:47:25,250 --> 01:47:27,375
Hey, Delhi! She's the
girl from our colony.

1749
01:47:27,958 --> 01:47:29,083
Remember the one at the medical shop?

1750
01:47:30,166 --> 01:47:32,416
She's trying hard for
kids for over a year now.

1751
01:47:34,375 --> 01:47:35,250
Baby…

1752
01:47:36,666 --> 01:47:37,916
you're tender like a baby.

1753
01:47:38,208 --> 01:47:39,708
Do you still need babies?

1754
01:47:46,916 --> 01:47:47,791
Hi.

1755
01:47:48,375 --> 01:47:49,208
Dilip!

1756
01:47:50,833 --> 01:47:52,125
Why don't you give me a chance?

1757
01:47:52,458 --> 01:47:53,708
- I will fulfill your wish.
- Hey.

1758
01:47:55,125 --> 01:47:57,083
I've helped many aunties get pregnant.

1759
01:47:57,833 --> 01:47:58,875
I can assist you as well.

1760
01:47:59,458 --> 01:48:01,791
You can trust me.
Just give me a chance.

1761
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:05,458
Please! Just give me a chance.

1762
01:48:15,625 --> 01:48:16,458
Delhi!

1763
01:48:16,750 --> 01:48:17,583
Delhi!

1764
01:48:17,750 --> 01:48:18,666
Delhi!

1765
01:48:25,458 --> 01:48:26,333
Hey!

1766
01:48:28,541 --> 01:48:33,208
If a lady wears a nuptial chain and
toe-rings, then it means she is married.

1767
01:48:34,375 --> 01:48:36,166
It's your bad luck that you messed
with her right in front of her husband.

1768
01:48:39,333 --> 01:48:40,291
That's me.

1769
01:49:29,458 --> 01:49:31,333
Hey, if I hit, it will be a six for sure!

1770
01:49:31,625 --> 01:49:32,458
- Got it?
- Hey!

1771
01:49:32,625 --> 01:49:33,625
- Go and hit it then!
- Teacher!

1772
01:49:34,125 --> 01:49:36,625
Hey, I am the best player
from Begumpet!

1773
01:49:36,708 --> 01:49:37,791
- Hit him, go on.
- Teacher!

1774
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:11,041
<i>What else do we want?</i>

1775
01:50:11,666 --> 01:50:12,541
We want nothing more, sir.

1776
01:50:12,875 --> 01:50:13,791
Out!

1777
01:50:14,208 --> 01:50:16,208
We smashed it at the ground.
And now we got smashed here.

1778
01:50:18,833 --> 01:50:19,791
Sorry, bro.

1779
01:50:30,625 --> 01:50:31,500
Kanna!

1780
01:50:32,125 --> 01:50:33,250
Baby, Sorry.

1781
01:50:35,166 --> 01:50:36,875
We didn't talk for two days.

1782
01:50:37,166 --> 01:50:38,875
I won't leave you until you talk to me.

1783
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:40,833
Kanna!

1784
01:50:41,875 --> 01:50:45,625
I feel these rifts are because of
the defects my dad pointed out.

1785
01:50:45,708 --> 01:50:48,125
What are you saying?
I don't think so.

1786
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:50,916
What about miscarriage?

1787
01:50:51,666 --> 01:50:52,791
That's a medical condition.

1788
01:50:53,083 --> 01:50:54,958
Didn't the doctor say that
it is quite common?

1789
01:50:55,583 --> 01:50:56,500
What about the fight on the terrace?

1790
01:50:56,750 --> 01:50:59,125
Oh, that's not a fight, Ara.

1791
01:50:59,541 --> 01:51:01,500
It's a miscommunication.

1792
01:51:04,833 --> 01:51:07,208
You will now see a different side of me.

1793
01:51:08,125 --> 01:51:09,750
Nothing will crop up between us.

1794
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:15,041
Don't you believe me?

1795
01:51:17,291 --> 01:51:18,250
Okay.

1796
01:51:19,083 --> 01:51:24,083
The world will see how good
a husband I am for the next 24 hours.

1797
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:29,916
Kanna!

1798
01:51:31,583 --> 01:51:32,541
Let's both get tested.

1799
01:51:36,500 --> 01:51:38,750
If there's some issue, we will fix it.

1800
01:51:39,500 --> 01:51:41,208
Else, as my dad said…

1801
01:51:41,291 --> 01:51:42,500
Why talk about your dad?

1802
01:51:44,750 --> 01:51:46,000
You want to get tested, right?

1803
01:51:48,250 --> 01:51:49,208
Aradhya will take rest…

1804
01:51:50,166 --> 01:51:51,041
and Kanna will work.

1805
01:51:51,958 --> 01:51:52,833
Fix it!

1806
01:51:59,083 --> 01:52:00,000
Love you Kanna.

1807
01:52:06,333 --> 01:52:07,250
Isn't the doctor here?

1808
01:52:12,708 --> 01:52:14,041
Hello, brother.

1809
01:52:15,791 --> 01:52:17,041
My friend, Viplav is a fresher.

1810
01:52:17,791 --> 01:52:18,916
Five years seniority.

1811
01:52:20,875 --> 01:52:21,791
You…

1812
01:52:22,166 --> 01:52:23,458
Why are you calling me out by name?

1813
01:52:24,833 --> 01:52:26,041
I will leave if you do all this.

1814
01:52:26,125 --> 01:52:27,250
Hey, just sit down, dude.

1815
01:52:27,458 --> 01:52:30,541
We're meeting Dappu Subhani,
the best sexologist in Bhongir.

1816
01:52:30,708 --> 01:52:34,041
But what's a Sexologist
doing in a fertility clinic?

1817
01:52:34,125 --> 01:52:37,000
There are deadly stories about him, dude!

1818
01:52:37,208 --> 01:52:39,458
But why are you embarrassing me, dude?

1819
01:52:39,916 --> 01:52:41,125
Keep quiet, bro.

1820
01:52:41,958 --> 01:52:43,333
I don't doubt my abilities.

1821
01:52:43,833 --> 01:52:45,208
I came here because of Aradhya.

1822
01:52:45,875 --> 01:52:46,958
Sit down, dude. Nothing to worry.

1823
01:52:50,666 --> 01:52:51,708
Thank you so much, dear!

1824
01:52:51,833 --> 01:52:53,250
Let's go.

1825
01:52:55,333 --> 01:52:56,166
Fill it to the brim.

1826
01:52:56,250 --> 01:52:57,500
Fill it to the brim…

1827
01:53:01,833 --> 01:53:03,875
Hey! What happened?

1828
01:53:04,041 --> 01:53:05,250
Why are so many people here?

1829
01:53:05,375 --> 01:53:06,583
Doctor is quite famous.

1830
01:53:06,666 --> 01:53:07,708
Hey, get lost!

1831
01:53:07,875 --> 01:53:09,833
Hey, I'll handle it. Come here.

1832
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:10,958
Uncle, move aside please.

1833
01:53:11,041 --> 01:53:12,708
- Why are you barging in like that?
- We are from the department, Uncle.

1834
01:53:12,791 --> 01:53:14,250
Which department?
How can you jump the queue?

1835
01:53:14,333 --> 01:53:15,625
We were ahead of you.

1836
01:53:15,791 --> 01:53:17,166
Uncle, my friend is from BSNL.

1837
01:53:17,250 --> 01:53:18,541
He came all the way from Chikkadpally.

1838
01:53:18,625 --> 01:53:20,458
- Move…
- Don't tell much about me.

1839
01:53:20,541 --> 01:53:22,083
So, what? I've shut
my vegetable shop as well!

1840
01:53:22,166 --> 01:53:24,125
Then what are you doing here?
Get out of here.

1841
01:53:24,250 --> 01:53:25,708
I am going through the same problem.

1842
01:53:25,791 --> 01:53:27,000
Try to understand, uncle.

1843
01:53:27,083 --> 01:53:29,000
What do you want us to understand?

1844
01:53:29,250 --> 01:53:30,708
- What are you talking?
- What do you want us to understand?

1845
01:53:30,833 --> 01:53:32,958
- Don't we have anything else to do?
- He won't take long.

1846
01:53:33,041 --> 01:53:34,166
Hey!

1847
01:53:35,708 --> 01:53:36,958
Hey, I am Viplav.

1848
01:53:37,750 --> 01:53:38,791
A BSNL employee.

1849
01:53:40,041 --> 01:53:42,083
Just wait for two minutes.
Let me fill it and come out.

1850
01:53:43,416 --> 01:53:45,666
- What nonsense is this?
- How can you let him go inside?

1851
01:53:45,916 --> 01:53:47,000
Fill it to the brim, dude.

1852
01:53:48,541 --> 01:53:49,916
For ten years of our company.

1853
01:53:50,416 --> 01:53:51,291
Aradhya.

1854
01:53:51,625 --> 01:53:53,250
I am so impressed with your work.

1855
01:53:53,916 --> 01:53:55,333
You are a big support for me.

1856
01:53:55,791 --> 01:53:56,750
Thank you, Michael.

1857
01:53:57,125 --> 01:53:58,458
Hey, let me advise you.

1858
01:53:58,708 --> 01:54:01,625
Whatever happens in life,
never miss a party, dude.

1859
01:54:01,791 --> 01:54:03,208
Okay? Just chill.

1860
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:05,291
- Aradhya.
- Hey!

1861
01:54:07,083 --> 01:54:07,916
Are you married?

1862
01:54:09,250 --> 01:54:10,125
Of course! Yes.

1863
01:54:10,833 --> 01:54:11,875
That's a bad news for me.

1864
01:54:12,708 --> 01:54:14,375
Otherwise, I would've married you.

1865
01:54:15,166 --> 01:54:16,000
- Do you want to marry him?
- That's okay.

1866
01:54:17,041 --> 01:54:19,000
Anyone can easily fall in love with you.

1867
01:54:19,166 --> 01:54:20,791
Hey, what happened?

1868
01:54:22,541 --> 01:54:25,541
That white fellow says
he will marry her if she was single.

1869
01:54:25,625 --> 01:54:29,250
Why is she cool about it
instead of giving him a tight slap?

1870
01:54:31,875 --> 01:54:32,958
I can't bear all this.
Let me go home.

1871
01:54:33,041 --> 01:54:33,916
Hey, dude.

1872
01:54:34,291 --> 01:54:36,625
The drinks are on the house.
Let's have some pegs and leave.

1873
01:54:36,708 --> 01:54:38,708
- Hey, I am leaving.
- Just two pegs, dude.

1874
01:54:39,500 --> 01:54:41,208
One peg for you… two pegs for me.

1875
01:54:41,291 --> 01:54:42,333
- Hey, no. Let's go.
- Hey.

1876
01:54:42,416 --> 01:54:43,291
Viplav…

1877
01:54:43,958 --> 01:54:45,875
- Hi.
- Let me introduce my client. Come.

1878
01:54:46,500 --> 01:54:47,333
No need.

1879
01:54:47,541 --> 01:54:48,625
- Are you okay?
- Go.

1880
01:54:49,875 --> 01:54:50,750
What happened to the test?

1881
01:54:54,541 --> 01:54:56,083
He must have failed the test.

1882
01:54:56,458 --> 01:54:58,583
He's surely down now.

1883
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:00,833
Guys are very sensitive on these matters.

1884
01:55:01,041 --> 01:55:02,666
Don't ask him now, Aradhya.

1885
01:55:02,875 --> 01:55:05,625
You can discuss at home.

1886
01:55:06,625 --> 01:55:07,458
Come.

1887
01:55:07,833 --> 01:55:08,666
Be it whatever--

1888
01:55:08,750 --> 01:55:11,625
Aradhya, my uncle is a
famous doctor in Australia.

1889
01:55:12,250 --> 01:55:15,166
He has treated men
aged over 50 for infertility.

1890
01:55:16,041 --> 01:55:17,333
Let's consult him for Viplav.

1891
01:55:20,041 --> 01:55:21,958
I know a saint from Berhampur.

1892
01:55:22,208 --> 01:55:23,625
Let's take Viplav there.

1893
01:55:23,916 --> 01:55:25,583
How do all of them know about it?
Did you tell them?

1894
01:55:25,833 --> 01:55:27,041
Why will I tell them?

1895
01:55:27,208 --> 01:55:29,208
I thought he is a powerhouse.

1896
01:55:29,500 --> 01:55:31,083
Oh my God!

1897
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:33,500
I'm going to kill myself.

1898
01:55:33,666 --> 01:55:35,375
- Hey, what happened now?
- I'm going to die.

1899
01:55:35,625 --> 01:55:38,875
Why is she telling everybody
about my personal issues?

1900
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,208
Bloody hell! These wives can't
keep anything to themselves.

1901
01:55:41,291 --> 01:55:43,416
Hey, stop it. Are you crazy?

1902
01:55:43,750 --> 01:55:46,125
Make an announcement.

1903
01:55:46,208 --> 01:55:47,458
Announce it.

1904
01:55:57,625 --> 01:55:59,125
Greetings to everyone.

1905
01:56:02,875 --> 01:56:04,916
A humble request to all the folks here

1906
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,958
who are agog with discussions
about my virulence and manliness.

1907
01:56:09,916 --> 01:56:12,458
I just got the lab test results.

1908
01:56:12,750 --> 01:56:15,666
I've got the certificate
about my virulence.

1909
01:56:17,666 --> 01:56:21,583
But my wife is spreading
fake stories to defame me.

1910
01:56:23,333 --> 01:56:24,958
Let me now share a story about my--

1911
01:56:25,583 --> 01:56:26,416
Sorry.

1912
01:56:27,458 --> 01:56:30,666
I mean, wives in general.

1913
01:56:30,875 --> 01:56:31,708
Just listen to me.

1914
01:56:44,416 --> 01:56:45,333
<i>Hey!</i>

1915
01:56:50,833 --> 01:56:53,750
<i>For the first time I have</i>
<i>Seen her in Kashmir</i>

1916
01:56:53,875 --> 01:56:56,708
<i>Without thinking anything</i>
<i>I started loving her</i>

1917
01:56:56,875 --> 01:56:59,458
<i>Without listening to my</i>
<i>father I came out for her</i>

1918
01:56:59,791 --> 01:57:02,500
<i>Got married to live happily with her</i>

1919
01:57:03,833 --> 01:57:05,666
<i>Then started struggling</i>

1920
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:08,375
<i>She has changed day by day</i>

1921
01:57:08,458 --> 01:57:09,791
<i>My dear wife</i>

1922
01:57:11,458 --> 01:57:14,208
<i>I became really angry with you</i>

1923
01:57:14,500 --> 01:57:15,791
<i>Please stop dear</i>

1924
01:57:17,416 --> 01:57:19,708
<i>I am struggling like cuckoo</i>
<i>Before the butcher killing it</i>

1925
01:57:20,791 --> 01:57:23,625
<i>Listen everybody</i>
<i>Let me tell you something</i>

1926
01:57:23,708 --> 01:57:26,458
<i>Don't even dream to get married</i>

1927
01:57:26,791 --> 01:57:31,500
<i>Wife is powerful than gun</i>
<i>She will get you pissed</i>

1928
01:57:32,875 --> 01:57:35,583
<i>Listen every body</i>
<i>Let me tell you something</i>

1929
01:57:35,666 --> 01:57:38,708
<i>Don't even dream to get married</i>

1930
01:57:38,875 --> 01:57:43,500
<i>Wife is powerful than gun</i>
<i>She will get you pissed</i>

1931
01:58:08,791 --> 01:58:11,500
<i>They won't open the door</i>
<i>When we go home late</i>

1932
01:58:11,833 --> 01:58:14,458
<i>If we drink with friends</i>
<i>They will peel off the skin with words</i>

1933
01:58:14,875 --> 01:58:17,458
<i>They always keeps eye on ex-girlfriend</i>

1934
01:58:17,875 --> 01:58:20,375
<i>They can track their husbands</i>

1935
01:58:20,708 --> 01:58:23,500
<i>They are they pamper you with nick names</i>

1936
01:58:23,875 --> 01:58:26,458
<i>They will tell husband</i>
<i>Is more than her family</i>

1937
01:58:26,791 --> 01:58:29,500
<i>If we speak one word against them</i>

1938
01:58:29,833 --> 01:58:32,541
<i>They will bite with tears</i>

1939
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:35,666
<i>Wife became a knife</i>

1940
01:58:36,958 --> 01:58:38,541
<i>My mind is blocked</i>

1941
01:58:39,958 --> 01:58:41,625
<i>Life has changed</i>

1942
01:58:42,958 --> 01:58:45,250
<i>My fate has burnt to ashes</i>

1943
01:58:59,833 --> 01:59:04,208
<i>Wives are ghosts</i>

1944
01:59:05,833 --> 01:59:10,208
<i>Ghosts are wives</i>

1945
01:59:11,791 --> 01:59:14,666
<i>Wives… you are not good wives</i>

1946
01:59:14,750 --> 01:59:17,500
<i>Ghosts… you are all ghosts</i>

1947
01:59:17,583 --> 01:59:18,916
<i>My dear wife</i>

1948
01:59:20,333 --> 01:59:23,250
<i>I became really angry with you</i>

1949
01:59:23,416 --> 01:59:24,875
<i>Please stop</i>

1950
01:59:26,375 --> 01:59:29,208
<i>I became a cuckoo in front of you</i>

1951
01:59:29,875 --> 01:59:32,583
<i>Listen every body Let</i>
<i>me tell you something</i>

1952
01:59:32,666 --> 01:59:35,625
<i>Don't even dream to get married</i>

1953
01:59:35,750 --> 01:59:40,375
<i>Wife is powerful than</i>
<i>gun She will get you pissed</i>

1954
01:59:41,791 --> 01:59:44,666
<i>Listen every body Let</i>
<i>me tell you something</i>

1955
01:59:44,791 --> 01:59:47,666
<i>Don't even dream to get married</i>

1956
01:59:47,791 --> 01:59:52,541
<i>Wife is powerful than</i>
<i>gun She will get you pissed</i>

1957
02:00:23,625 --> 02:00:26,000
We've a fight in less than 24 hours.

1958
02:00:26,791 --> 02:00:27,916
Who said couples don't fight?

1959
02:00:29,125 --> 02:00:30,500
Couples always fight.

1960
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:37,291
If both of us don't have a
problem, then where's the problem?

1961
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:40,041
You tell me about it.

1962
02:00:40,583 --> 02:00:42,958
As my dad foretold, the problem
lies in that horoscope defect.

1963
02:00:43,541 --> 02:00:47,416
All this is because you
haven't done that oblation yet.

1964
02:00:47,541 --> 02:00:48,458
Aradhya…

1965
02:00:49,583 --> 02:00:51,583
my dad has an image
to live up to in society.

1966
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,666
I can't make him do all these rituals.

1967
02:00:57,708 --> 02:00:59,666
Please give some time.
Everything will get sorted.

1968
02:01:00,500 --> 02:01:02,291
Nothing will change for years, Viplav.

1969
02:01:03,083 --> 02:01:05,125
Do you remember that one day
we were talking about miscarriage

1970
02:01:05,375 --> 02:01:07,250
at traffic signal

1971
02:01:07,333 --> 02:01:09,833
and a saint threw holy ash
and said the same thing.

1972
02:01:09,916 --> 02:01:10,791
So?

1973
02:01:11,375 --> 02:01:13,625
Everyone is trying to
nudge us to do the oblation.

1974
02:01:13,875 --> 02:01:14,708
Hey!

1975
02:01:15,833 --> 02:01:16,666
Have you gone mad?

1976
02:01:17,375 --> 02:01:18,583
Why do you talk as if
you're possessed by a devil?

1977
02:01:18,666 --> 02:01:21,333
So, you trust the devil but can't
seem to believe in God!

1978
02:01:21,416 --> 02:01:22,750
Oh, Aradhya. Just leave me alone. Please.

1979
02:01:24,708 --> 02:01:25,875
So, do you want me to walk out?

1980
02:01:25,958 --> 02:01:27,500
No, I am asking you to
leave me now!

1981
02:01:27,708 --> 02:01:29,041
Let me go to sleep.
We'll talk tomorrow.

1982
02:01:42,500 --> 02:01:43,375
Have something.

1983
02:01:45,791 --> 02:01:46,916
Did you guys fight again?

1984
02:01:49,833 --> 02:01:51,625
It's Lissy's birthday in two days.

1985
02:01:52,583 --> 02:01:54,250
Thomas and I are going to Alleppey.

1986
02:01:55,458 --> 02:01:56,583
It's a beautiful place.

1987
02:01:57,958 --> 02:02:00,041
You and Aradhya need a change.

1988
02:02:00,291 --> 02:02:01,833
Both of you can come with us.

1989
02:02:02,333 --> 02:02:03,166
Oh, ma'am.

1990
02:02:03,916 --> 02:02:04,916
Why Aradhya?

1991
02:02:06,083 --> 02:02:08,791
We don't want to play
spoilsport in your party.

1992
02:02:11,333 --> 02:02:13,875
Don't make excuses, Viplav?
It's my daughter's birthday.

1993
02:02:14,041 --> 02:02:15,041
Please listen to me…

1994
02:02:15,791 --> 02:02:17,416
You are coming with her.

1995
02:02:19,041 --> 02:02:19,958
Okay?

1996
02:02:28,333 --> 02:02:29,791
Ms. Zoya and her
husband left for Alleppey.

1997
02:02:33,666 --> 02:02:35,125
I just dropped them.

1998
02:02:35,791 --> 02:02:36,750
It's Lissy's birthday.

1999
02:02:40,541 --> 02:02:42,416
They also invited us.
It will be nice to go to Kerala.

2000
02:02:47,208 --> 02:02:48,208
Look Aradhya,

2001
02:02:49,083 --> 02:02:52,083
Ms. Zoya has helped us
a lot since our marriage.

2002
02:02:53,250 --> 02:02:54,458
So, drop your ego…

2003
02:02:56,791 --> 02:02:57,625
I mean,

2004
02:02:57,958 --> 02:03:02,166
let's drop our egos and go there.
They will be happy to have us.

2005
02:03:04,500 --> 02:03:06,166
Let us not be childish…

2006
02:03:07,041 --> 02:03:08,250
and act more mature.

2007
02:03:23,083 --> 02:03:27,333
<i>You are trying to be away from me</i>

2008
02:03:31,458 --> 02:03:35,375
{\an8}<i>Blushing away from me</i>

2009
02:03:36,583 --> 02:03:40,333
Sir, Kunjappan boat is the
best boat available in Alleppey.

2010
02:03:40,875 --> 02:03:42,916
If you are in love, you will tie the
knot when you got onto this boat.

2011
02:03:43,083 --> 02:03:45,458
If you are married,
you will have kids here.

2012
02:03:45,791 --> 02:03:47,208
How many kids do you have?

2013
02:03:47,833 --> 02:03:49,208
How many kids, sir?

2014
02:03:49,500 --> 02:03:50,458
How many kids, sir?

2015
02:03:54,708 --> 02:03:56,666
You drive it.

2016
02:03:59,541 --> 02:04:00,416
Go forward.

2017
02:04:10,583 --> 02:04:11,458
Aradhya.

2018
02:04:27,416 --> 02:04:28,416
It's not what you think.

2019
02:04:28,958 --> 02:04:30,083
I am in my monthly cycle.

2020
02:04:31,791 --> 02:04:33,375
We would have canceled
the programme in that case.

2021
02:04:34,541 --> 02:04:36,625
Now, you say that.
But if I said this earlier…

2022
02:04:38,166 --> 02:04:43,041
you would have put labels
on me, as a liar and an egotist.

2023
02:04:43,416 --> 02:04:45,750
Please don't start arguing with me.

2024
02:04:46,666 --> 02:04:48,125
- Am I arguing?
- Obviously!

2025
02:04:49,375 --> 02:04:50,333
All I am saying is that…

2026
02:04:51,291 --> 02:04:53,625
you should have told me before
we started. What's wrong with that?

2027
02:04:54,708 --> 02:04:56,458
Did you really ask me
if I was alright or not?

2028
02:04:56,541 --> 02:04:58,750
Why do you girls turn out like
this after marriage, Aradhya?

2029
02:04:59,541 --> 02:05:00,916
Always fussing about it.

2030
02:05:03,041 --> 02:05:06,625
If you didn't want to spend time with me,
you could've stayed back at home.

2031
02:05:07,375 --> 02:05:08,750
I came here for Ms. Zoya.

2032
02:05:09,500 --> 02:05:11,208
Superb! Thank you.

2033
02:05:12,625 --> 02:05:15,916
Just stay patient for two day for the
sake of Ms. Zoya without fighting!

2034
02:05:16,958 --> 02:05:18,041
Later, you can do what you feel like.

2035
02:05:19,125 --> 02:05:21,583
You can decide if you want to stay with me
or go to your house.

2036
02:05:23,750 --> 02:05:26,375
Let's stay away from
each other for a few days.

2037
02:05:26,541 --> 02:05:27,958
I am not at all at peace.

2038
02:05:57,583 --> 02:05:59,875
<i>The moment</i>

2039
02:06:00,458 --> 02:06:02,625
<i>When my heart dissolves</i>

2040
02:06:03,208 --> 02:06:07,208
<i>In your nearness</i>

2041
02:06:08,833 --> 02:06:11,500
<i>Praising your name</i>

2042
02:06:11,625 --> 02:06:14,333
<i>With all my heart</i>

2043
02:06:14,416 --> 02:06:18,500
<i>Is all I want</i>

2044
02:06:20,208 --> 02:06:22,833
<i>Oh Lord</i>

2045
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:25,583
<i>Who saves this world</i>

2046
02:06:25,666 --> 02:06:29,958
<i>With boundless love</i>

2047
02:06:31,458 --> 02:06:34,000
<i>In your world</i>

2048
02:06:34,208 --> 02:06:36,875
<i>My child's life is</i>

2049
02:06:36,958 --> 02:06:41,208
<i>Sweeter than the elixir</i>

2050
02:06:44,125 --> 02:06:46,625
Let's celebrate Lissy's birthday.

2051
02:06:47,083 --> 02:06:48,458
Happy birthday, Lissy.

2052
02:06:51,958 --> 02:06:53,500
Thank you, Father for the prayer service.

2053
02:06:53,583 --> 02:06:54,666
Come on, let's enjoy.

2054
02:06:54,750 --> 02:06:58,041
Everybody, please enjoy!

2055
02:06:58,625 --> 02:07:01,166
- Viplav! Welcome.
- Hi, Viplav. Aradhya.

2056
02:07:02,166 --> 02:07:04,291
Hey, why are you looking sad, Viplav?

2057
02:07:04,458 --> 02:07:05,833
Don't you know it is
Lissy's birthday today?

2058
02:07:05,916 --> 02:07:07,583
Come, let's enjoy.

2059
02:07:09,125 --> 02:07:11,875
Lissy doesn't like gloomy faces.

2060
02:07:13,916 --> 02:07:15,500
It is Lissy's birthday, Viplav.

2061
02:07:15,708 --> 02:07:17,625
You must have a drink.

2062
02:07:18,500 --> 02:07:19,500
Come on. Cheers.

2063
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:20,833
Cheers.

2064
02:07:22,125 --> 02:07:23,000
No!

2065
02:07:30,375 --> 02:07:31,750
What happened to Lissy, ma'am?

2066
02:07:32,875 --> 02:07:35,625
Lissy… Her time's up.

2067
02:07:37,333 --> 02:07:38,291
She's gone.

2068
02:07:49,666 --> 02:07:52,041
I still remember the
day I delivered Lissy.

2069
02:07:53,750 --> 02:07:54,875
She was a premature baby…

2070
02:07:57,500 --> 02:08:01,375
with most features unformed yet.

2071
02:08:05,916 --> 02:08:09,000
When I picked her up,
the doctors warned that…

2072
02:08:10,333 --> 02:08:11,625
she is extremely fragile
and may break her bones.

2073
02:08:14,375 --> 02:08:15,791
My heart sank…

2074
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:18,458
that very moment.

2075
02:08:22,458 --> 02:08:25,958
All the relatives who saw her
left without saying a word.

2076
02:08:28,583 --> 02:08:30,958
Doctors gave her just six months.

2077
02:08:35,125 --> 02:08:37,125
That was when Thomas patted me…

2078
02:08:38,416 --> 02:08:39,250
and said…

2079
02:08:41,875 --> 02:08:46,625
he will do everything in
his powers to save her life.

2080
02:08:50,750 --> 02:08:51,750
The confidence he gave me…

2081
02:08:53,833 --> 02:08:55,541
helped us save Lissy for five years.

2082
02:09:00,208 --> 02:09:01,833
After that, we didn't want any kids.

2083
02:09:03,291 --> 02:09:04,250
We don't want to…

2084
02:09:05,750 --> 02:09:07,333
trouble another life.

2085
02:09:08,791 --> 02:09:10,250
We just became kids to each other.

2086
02:09:14,375 --> 02:09:17,125
With or without Lissy…

2087
02:09:18,958 --> 02:09:20,458
Thomas stood like a
rock of support for me.

2088
02:09:23,416 --> 02:09:24,750
Thomas is my courage.

2089
02:09:30,666 --> 02:09:31,500
Hey.

2090
02:09:38,250 --> 02:09:39,333
Why talk melancholic

2091
02:09:39,416 --> 02:09:41,375
- when the mood is so upbeat?
- Correct.

2092
02:09:48,708 --> 02:09:49,666
Yes, Viplav.

2093
02:09:50,916 --> 02:09:52,041
Backwaters…

2094
02:09:54,041 --> 02:09:54,916
romantic mood…

2095
02:09:56,666 --> 02:09:57,500
Enjoy.

2096
02:09:57,666 --> 02:09:58,833
- Right?
- Yes.

2097
02:09:58,916 --> 02:09:59,875
- Come on.
- Enjoy.

2098
02:10:54,791 --> 02:10:55,625
Aradhya.

2099
02:11:08,750 --> 02:11:09,625
Kunjappan!

2100
02:11:11,833 --> 02:11:12,750
Kunjappan!

2101
02:11:17,083 --> 02:11:17,916
{\an8}Sir?

2102
02:11:18,083 --> 02:11:19,083
Did you see Aradhya?

2103
02:11:19,416 --> 02:11:20,250
Sir?

2104
02:11:20,583 --> 02:11:21,916
Aradhya? My wife?

2105
02:11:23,166 --> 02:11:24,125
Hey, Johnson!

2106
02:11:24,791 --> 02:11:25,666
{\an8}What?

2107
02:11:25,750 --> 02:11:27,500
Did you see sir's wife
traveling in a boat?

2108
02:11:28,083 --> 02:11:30,333
Yes, she left a while ago.

2109
02:11:31,083 --> 02:11:33,666
Sir, she left half an hour ago.

2110
02:11:34,666 --> 02:11:36,041
Kunjappan, take the boat out!

2111
02:11:36,791 --> 02:11:39,416
It's difficult to catch up in a boat.
Let's go on the bike.

2112
02:11:55,666 --> 02:11:56,500
Aradhya…

2113
02:11:59,666 --> 02:12:00,500
where are you going?

2114
02:12:04,041 --> 02:12:06,875
As you wanted, I came for Ms. Zoya.

2115
02:12:07,750 --> 02:12:08,708
Now I am leaving.

2116
02:12:10,416 --> 02:12:11,500
Where are you going, Aradhya?

2117
02:12:14,375 --> 02:12:15,208
To my house.

2118
02:12:21,958 --> 02:12:23,708
Okay then, let me also join you.

2119
02:12:24,041 --> 02:12:27,125
Why do you want to come when
you wish to part ways, Viplav?

2120
02:12:28,666 --> 02:12:30,125
What are you talking, Aradhya?

2121
02:12:32,750 --> 02:12:34,166
You don't get what I want.

2122
02:12:36,125 --> 02:12:37,375
When I ask, you shout at me.

2123
02:12:38,916 --> 02:12:41,250
I am scared to even talk to you, Viplav.

2124
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:46,916
All this while, I thought

2125
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:49,625
you had a problem only with
my family and our orthodox ways.

2126
02:12:50,416 --> 02:12:51,583
Ma'am, will you come or not?

2127
02:12:52,916 --> 02:12:55,250
I am your only problem.

2128
02:12:57,666 --> 02:12:58,583
Ara…

2129
02:13:03,250 --> 02:13:09,666
<i>Dear heart</i>

2130
02:13:10,583 --> 02:13:16,500
<i>Biding goodbye to us</i>

2131
02:13:17,958 --> 02:13:23,833
<i>Amidst nostalgic thoughts</i>
<i>Can you feel it?</i>

2132
02:13:24,750 --> 02:13:27,875
<i>The heart is wounded</i>

2133
02:13:28,083 --> 02:13:31,500
<i>Wishing to end life</i>

2134
02:13:32,208 --> 02:13:35,500
<i>Ego is crushing friendship</i>

2135
02:13:35,833 --> 02:13:39,500
<i>Who really owns the other?</i>

2136
02:13:39,625 --> 02:13:46,250
<i>Heart is lost in anxiety</i>
<i>While silent pauses go up</i>

2137
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:50,125
<i>The tight grip of the past ends</i>

2138
02:13:50,583 --> 02:13:54,375
<i>With a sense of loss of bonding</i>

2139
02:14:31,958 --> 02:14:34,875
<i>You stood by me</i>

2140
02:14:34,958 --> 02:14:38,875
<i>All these days like a loyal shadow</i>

2141
02:14:39,833 --> 02:14:46,125
<i>But now you desire to</i>
<i>Desert me for few days only</i>

2142
02:14:46,625 --> 02:14:50,041
<i>Every thought</i>
<i>In remembrance of you</i>

2143
02:14:50,166 --> 02:14:53,625
<i>Is a meditation in love</i>

2144
02:14:54,041 --> 02:14:57,416
<i>But even a moment of forgetting me</i>

2145
02:14:57,791 --> 02:15:00,708
<i>Makes me pine for you</i>

2146
02:15:00,791 --> 02:15:07,458
<i>The heart is wounded</i>
<i>Wishing to end life</i>

2147
02:15:08,125 --> 02:15:11,250
<i>Ego is crushing friendship</i>

2148
02:15:11,833 --> 02:15:15,541
<i>Who really owns the other?</i>

2149
02:15:22,208 --> 02:15:23,083
Hello!

2150
02:15:27,166 --> 02:15:28,083
Aradhya!

2151
02:15:38,750 --> 02:15:40,125
<i>Hello, Mr. Shanmukham.</i>

2152
02:15:40,750 --> 02:15:43,291
It's common to see fights
between a wife and a husband.

2153
02:15:43,458 --> 02:15:45,125
My friend is pining for Aradhya, sir.

2154
02:15:45,250 --> 02:15:46,916
Please ask her to talk to him once, sir.

2155
02:15:47,083 --> 02:15:48,166
What's there to talk now?

2156
02:15:48,250 --> 02:15:49,625
There is no relationship between them.

2157
02:15:50,250 --> 02:15:51,833
Aradhya herself says it's all over.

2158
02:15:55,541 --> 02:15:57,541
It seems there's nothing between the
both of you. Aradhya herself said it.

2159
02:15:57,833 --> 02:15:59,583
Let's leave.
It's getting late. Let's go.

2160
02:16:03,083 --> 02:16:04,583
I can't stay without her, dude.

2161
02:16:09,625 --> 02:16:16,000
<i>Like a Hibiscus flower</i>
<i>That burns in fire silently</i>

2162
02:16:17,458 --> 02:16:23,791
<i>I will remain with you forever</i>
<i>In your moments of grief</i>

2163
02:16:24,333 --> 02:16:31,125
<i>Whether it's a piercing arrow</i>
<i>Or uneasiness, or a dark vacuum</i>

2164
02:16:31,791 --> 02:16:33,541
<i>A boon from sweetheart</i>

2165
02:16:33,625 --> 02:16:38,333
<i>Or my last breath</i>
<i>Or an ocean of separation between us</i>

2166
02:16:38,416 --> 02:16:41,375
<i>The heart is wounded</i>

2167
02:16:42,208 --> 02:16:45,250
<i>Wishing to end life</i>

2168
02:16:45,791 --> 02:16:49,125
<i>Ego is crushing friendship</i>

2169
02:16:49,541 --> 02:16:53,000
<i>Who really owns the other?</i>

2170
02:16:53,250 --> 02:16:59,833
<i>Heart is lost in anxiety</i>
<i>While silent pauses go up</i>

2171
02:17:00,708 --> 02:17:03,791
<i>The tight grip of the past ends</i>

2172
02:17:04,333 --> 02:17:08,375
<i>With a sense of loss of bonding</i>

2173
02:17:08,708 --> 02:17:15,250
<i>Dear heart</i>

2174
02:17:15,916 --> 02:17:22,333
<i>Biding goodbye to us</i>

2175
02:17:23,375 --> 02:17:29,541
<i>Amidst nostalgic thoughts</i>
<i>Can you feel it?</i>

2176
02:17:37,750 --> 02:17:39,125
The auspicious time needs to be changed.

2177
02:17:39,625 --> 02:17:40,833
I will consult uncle and revert.

2178
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:42,583
Call me after reaching Kakinada.

2179
02:17:53,791 --> 02:17:55,625
Uncle!

2180
02:18:14,791 --> 02:18:16,125
I will do the sacred oblation, sir.

2181
02:18:17,708 --> 02:18:19,166
What about your father?

2182
02:18:19,708 --> 02:18:21,666
My uncle said that both of you
need to perform the oblation.

2183
02:18:21,791 --> 02:18:23,125
Is he joining you?

2184
02:18:24,458 --> 02:18:25,750
I still reiterate the same.

2185
02:18:26,916 --> 02:18:31,458
Is the hard-core atheist
Mr. Lenin Satyam coming to the temple?

2186
02:18:36,416 --> 02:18:37,500
Aradhya.

2187
02:18:38,041 --> 02:18:39,375
We will talk about it only
after the oblation.

2188
02:18:43,833 --> 02:18:47,125
Oh, it's you, son! Come inside.

2189
02:18:47,458 --> 02:18:48,791
Why don't you call him in?

2190
02:18:51,083 --> 02:18:56,375
Does he really want to come inside our
home amid the cows and the rituals we do?

2191
02:18:57,541 --> 02:18:59,250
Carry on. We'll notify you later.

2192
02:19:31,083 --> 02:19:32,166
Do you want to do the oblation?

2193
02:19:33,833 --> 02:19:37,500
This is Chadarangam's scheme
to make me appear like a clown in public.

2194
02:19:38,708 --> 02:19:41,125
You can go for it, but
don't drag me into it.

2195
02:19:42,041 --> 02:19:45,791
I am warning you again. You can't stand
their nonsense for even ten minutes.

2196
02:19:46,500 --> 02:19:49,083
I am done with this discussion.
Forget Aradhya.

2197
02:19:56,458 --> 02:19:58,791
Dad, aren't you and mom
now married for 30 years?

2198
02:20:00,625 --> 02:20:01,541
Of course.

2199
02:20:02,083 --> 02:20:04,083
Mom never believes in your
philosophies and principles.

2200
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,166
She still believes in God.

2201
02:20:10,125 --> 02:20:11,958
How did you stand her
for all these years, Dad?

2202
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:15,291
Why didn't you desert mom?

2203
02:20:16,916 --> 02:20:18,125
She is my wife…

2204
02:20:20,291 --> 02:20:21,250
and I…

2205
02:20:24,041 --> 02:20:25,291
love her too much.

2206
02:20:28,583 --> 02:20:31,583
If your love for your wife
can stand for 30 years…

2207
02:20:33,791 --> 02:20:36,875
can't I stand my wife for three hours to
sit for the oblation and oblige her?

2208
02:20:39,083 --> 02:20:40,416
The oblation is in Kakinada tomorrow.

2209
02:20:41,291 --> 02:20:42,500
It starts with me,

2210
02:20:43,583 --> 02:20:44,875
but it will get completed
only with your presence.

2211
02:20:46,083 --> 02:20:46,916
I am leaving.

2212
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:14,208
Wear this dhoti and circumambulate
101 times around the temple.

2213
02:21:14,291 --> 02:21:15,458
Then you must sit for the oblation,

2214
02:21:16,250 --> 02:21:17,375
along with your dad!

2215
02:21:18,208 --> 02:21:20,666
If this Satyam fellow won't turn up,
the whole ceremony will be a waste!

2216
02:21:21,041 --> 02:21:23,416
Are we ready for the oblation, priest?

2217
02:21:29,291 --> 02:21:31,333
Dear, can you help me tie up?

2218
02:21:31,458 --> 02:21:34,083
You're such a grown-up!
Don't you know to wear a dhoti?

2219
02:21:37,500 --> 02:21:38,333
Turn around.

2220
02:22:01,208 --> 02:22:02,958
Hey, the boy is here.
Talk to him.

2221
02:22:03,583 --> 02:22:04,583
Talk to him.

2222
02:22:16,541 --> 02:22:17,375
Aradhya…

2223
02:22:19,166 --> 02:22:21,083
I need to speak to you once.

2224
02:22:23,666 --> 02:22:24,541
Aradhya.

2225
02:22:25,541 --> 02:22:26,416
Hey, Viplav.

2226
02:22:30,458 --> 02:22:31,583
Did she speak to you?

2227
02:22:32,541 --> 02:22:33,541
What's this attire, dude?

2228
02:22:33,666 --> 02:22:35,958
Can't you make out if the
damn thing is coming off?

2229
02:22:36,041 --> 02:22:37,833
Hey, need a holy cow. Go, get it.

2230
02:22:37,958 --> 02:22:38,791
What cow?

2231
02:22:38,916 --> 02:22:41,041
- Cow, dude!
- We need to gift one cow after the ritual.

2232
02:22:41,208 --> 02:22:42,041
Get one, son.

2233
02:22:42,166 --> 02:22:43,125
A cow?

2234
02:22:44,583 --> 02:22:45,541
Mom, where's dad?

2235
02:22:47,708 --> 02:22:49,916
You wished for too much
to expect dad to turn up.

2236
02:22:51,125 --> 02:22:54,875
For him, it is principles
before anything else.

2237
02:22:56,083 --> 02:23:00,166
Let me sit on his behalf.
I will convince the big man.

2238
02:23:00,250 --> 02:23:01,291
Mom, he won't allow.

2239
02:23:02,375 --> 02:23:04,000
It is complete only if dad comes.

2240
02:23:04,333 --> 02:23:05,166
But he won't.

2241
02:23:08,416 --> 02:23:13,166
He sees God and these
temples as mere stones.

2242
02:23:13,958 --> 02:23:16,416
But nobody is as heartless as your dad!

2243
02:23:18,583 --> 02:23:20,000
How did you think

2244
02:23:20,291 --> 02:23:23,583
he will mend ways

2245
02:23:24,333 --> 02:23:26,916
and come for the oblation
only for his son?

2246
02:23:48,500 --> 02:23:51,500
But I will do anything for you, my son.

2247
02:23:52,333 --> 02:23:56,083
Even if it means, falling at their feet.

2248
02:24:14,041 --> 02:24:14,958
Tell me…

2249
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:17,083
what do I need to do, son?

2250
02:24:18,708 --> 02:24:20,625
You don't worry…

2251
02:24:22,125 --> 02:24:24,708
Uncle, Lenin Satyam has arrived.

2252
02:24:41,208 --> 02:24:42,958
Put saffron on the forehead.

2253
02:25:17,250 --> 02:25:20,083
Sir, hold your nose with
your hands and say "mama".

2254
02:25:20,750 --> 02:25:21,583
"Mama."

2255
02:25:21,916 --> 02:25:22,750
"Mama."

2256
02:25:31,541 --> 02:25:33,791
Pray to God to grant your wish.

2257
02:25:50,166 --> 02:25:51,208
Make a wish.

2258
02:25:59,083 --> 02:26:00,750
Dear, can I bring water for you?

2259
02:26:00,833 --> 02:26:01,791
Dad, are you okay?

2260
02:26:03,291 --> 02:26:04,250
It's okay.

2261
02:26:16,916 --> 02:26:18,625
If you place that in the sacred fire

2262
02:26:18,708 --> 02:26:20,291
then the ritual will be done.
Get up.

2263
02:26:51,500 --> 02:26:52,750
Uncle, come.

2264
02:26:52,833 --> 02:26:54,083
Dear, come.

2265
02:26:56,208 --> 02:26:57,333
Dear, come.

2266
02:26:57,666 --> 02:26:59,541
Viplav, come here.

2267
02:27:06,125 --> 02:27:06,958
Ask him to come in.

2268
02:27:08,416 --> 02:27:09,250
Please come.

2269
02:27:10,583 --> 02:27:12,625
Oh God! Why did it have to rain?

2270
02:27:31,291 --> 02:27:32,208
It's okay.

2271
02:27:33,875 --> 02:27:36,875
I'll participate in the ritual
however long it takes.

2272
02:27:39,041 --> 02:27:41,958
I am fine if you win,

2273
02:27:43,583 --> 02:27:44,541
and I lose it.

2274
02:27:48,041 --> 02:27:49,041
It's not a big deal.

2275
02:27:50,541 --> 02:27:52,083
But my son is going to prosper.

2276
02:27:53,916 --> 02:27:54,833
That's enough for me.

2277
02:28:00,750 --> 02:28:01,666
Mr. Satyam…

2278
02:28:03,375 --> 02:28:06,958
when Viplav relented and
came home to commit to this ritual,

2279
02:28:08,083 --> 02:28:09,666
I didn't think we won.

2280
02:28:11,791 --> 02:28:14,083
We saw the depth of love
your son had for my daughter.

2281
02:28:17,333 --> 02:28:20,666
Even today, when you stooped down to
perform this oblation for your son's sake,

2282
02:28:20,750 --> 02:28:22,333
I didn't see my victory.

2283
02:28:24,541 --> 02:28:26,708
I only saw your love for your son.

2284
02:28:29,583 --> 02:28:32,833
While fighting for my
shastras or your philosophy,

2285
02:28:34,291 --> 02:28:36,041
we are forgetting humanity.

2286
02:28:40,708 --> 02:28:42,125
I know that even if I seem like a winner

2287
02:28:42,208 --> 02:28:44,833
by making you bend your
way to sit through the ritual,

2288
02:28:45,833 --> 02:28:48,083
I have lost it as a human being.
What's the point?

2289
02:28:55,583 --> 02:28:57,833
Before I called it off,
God intervened and called it off.

2290
02:28:59,333 --> 02:29:01,541
He will take care of both the kids now.

2291
02:29:06,083 --> 02:29:08,250
You can leave with my
daughter after the rain stops.

2292
02:29:25,458 --> 02:29:27,625
Aradhya… I will do any
number of rigorous rituals…

2293
02:29:29,458 --> 02:29:30,875
or change my attires…

2294
02:29:33,458 --> 02:29:34,708
if you remain with me.

2295
02:29:40,208 --> 02:29:43,333
If this oblation can settle our love,
I would have agreed to it long back.

2296
02:29:45,625 --> 02:29:48,625
I wanted both of us to overcome all of
these and become stronger and hence…

2297
02:29:51,791 --> 02:29:53,416
What does strong mean, Viplav?

2298
02:29:56,958 --> 02:30:00,166
Is it only to threaten…

2299
02:30:02,833 --> 02:30:04,083
or to split ways each time?

2300
02:30:08,541 --> 02:30:11,125
I will ensure we will never
fight again, Aradhya.

2301
02:30:12,791 --> 02:30:13,916
Fights will happen, Viplav.

2302
02:30:14,833 --> 02:30:15,958
Fights will happen.

2303
02:30:18,208 --> 02:30:21,708
But if we are united,
we can say we are stronger.

2304
02:30:23,708 --> 02:30:26,666
While you reckon these
episodes as friction,

2305
02:30:27,958 --> 02:30:28,916
I see it as love.

2306
02:30:31,916 --> 02:30:33,166
We are girls, Viplav.

2307
02:30:35,666 --> 02:30:36,916
There are things we confess to God…

2308
02:30:38,125 --> 02:30:40,375
that we won't dare sharing
even with dad or husband.

2309
02:30:42,375 --> 02:30:43,708
And I left that…

2310
02:30:45,625 --> 02:30:47,750
God to be with you.

2311
02:30:52,041 --> 02:30:54,541
Where shall I go if you ask me to leave?

2312
02:30:57,125 --> 02:30:58,375
I am still learning, Aradhya.

2313
02:30:59,791 --> 02:31:00,916
I am still learning.

2314
02:31:02,916 --> 02:31:04,125
I can see the pain you went through.

2315
02:31:06,791 --> 02:31:10,791
And the affection towards me
behind your desire to do the ritual.

2316
02:31:14,708 --> 02:31:18,000
But when I was alone for ten days…

2317
02:31:19,750 --> 02:31:22,291
I understood how it was like
living without you.

2318
02:31:26,416 --> 02:31:28,041
The way Thomas
stood like a rock for Zoya,

2319
02:31:28,583 --> 02:31:29,541
that's true love.

2320
02:31:31,333 --> 02:31:32,625
I promise to stand by you too.

2321
02:31:33,916 --> 02:31:36,916
Each and every day,
for the rest of our lives!

2322
02:31:39,166 --> 02:31:41,458
Let's complete this oblation
and get back home, Aradhya.

2323
02:31:42,333 --> 02:31:44,333
I don't want any more
of these rituals, Viplav.

2324
02:31:45,625 --> 02:31:47,125
All I need is to be with you.

2325
02:31:48,416 --> 02:31:50,250
Whether we beget kids or not,

2326
02:31:51,375 --> 02:31:54,541
or whether we spend our
last days in old age home,

2327
02:31:54,875 --> 02:31:56,250
we both must be together.

2328
02:31:58,666 --> 02:31:59,541
Kids?

2329
02:32:01,333 --> 02:32:02,666
We don't give them a chance.

2330
02:32:03,958 --> 02:32:05,791
Let's send them to the hostel.

2331
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:15,166
Let us demonstrate to the world
that we are meant for each other.

2332
02:32:16,625 --> 02:32:17,708
Let's prove it.

2333
02:32:20,583 --> 02:32:21,500
Let's prove it.

2334
02:32:23,416 --> 02:32:24,333
Let's prove it.

2335
02:32:25,166 --> 02:32:26,166
Let's prove it.

2336
02:32:39,041 --> 02:32:40,000
Uncles…

2337
02:32:40,125 --> 02:32:43,250
as I told you, Aradhya and Viplav are
happily married, and have a baby girl now.

2338
02:32:43,333 --> 02:32:44,625
Both of you
have become grandparents.

2339
02:32:45,208 --> 02:32:46,916
Hello, What's the matter?

2340
02:32:47,291 --> 02:32:51,458
You called me and now
you are making me wait.

2341
02:32:51,750 --> 02:32:54,000
What do you think of me?

2342
02:32:55,666 --> 02:32:58,125
Do you want to get your
child's ear pierced

2343
02:32:58,208 --> 02:32:59,791
under my presence or not?

2344
02:32:59,916 --> 02:33:02,791
- Where is the baby?
- She's coming, sir.

2345
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:06,041
Aradhya, get the baby.

2346
02:33:17,416 --> 02:33:20,666
Wait! Are you going to
pierce her ear with that now?

2347
02:33:21,125 --> 02:33:23,416
Why does he dread me as if I am a
factionist wielding sharp weapon?

2348
02:33:23,541 --> 02:33:26,166
I make this ritual look
like a breeze! Tell him that.

2349
02:33:26,250 --> 02:33:28,333
It will prick like an ant bite, Viplav.

2350
02:33:28,625 --> 02:33:29,833
- Just give her to mother-in-law.
- Give her to me.

2351
02:33:33,083 --> 02:33:34,166
- Careful!
- Careful!

2352
02:33:37,916 --> 02:33:39,041
It's okay, Kanna.

2353
02:33:39,708 --> 02:33:40,541
That's all right.

2354
02:33:41,666 --> 02:33:43,666
- Careful!
- Careful!

2355
02:33:45,833 --> 02:33:48,458
I understand how much
you care for your baby.

2356
02:33:48,916 --> 02:33:51,791
Do we stop taking vaccine
just because it pains a moment?

2357
02:33:51,916 --> 02:33:54,166
Okay, I have an idea.

2358
02:33:59,208 --> 02:34:01,875
- Careful!
- To heck with all of you!

2359
02:34:01,958 --> 02:34:06,208
Sir, just be a bit careful. Please.

2360
02:34:06,708 --> 02:34:07,791
What?

2361
02:34:08,375 --> 02:34:10,750
Just be careful. Please.

2362
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:12,416
Oh!

2363
02:34:13,083 --> 02:34:14,250
Please be careful.

2364
02:34:15,208 --> 02:34:17,166
We are just asking you to be careful.

2365
02:34:17,583 --> 02:34:19,000
Why don't you come and do this yourself?

2366
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:21,583
Everyone is instructing me.

2367
02:34:22,583 --> 02:34:25,000
Not now. We'll do it
after the girl grows up.

2368
02:34:25,083 --> 02:34:28,541
Will you get her ear pierced
after she grows up?

2369
02:34:29,583 --> 02:34:33,166
Better do it after she reaches her age.

2370
02:34:33,250 --> 02:34:35,041
You can call me then.
I will do the needful.

2371
02:34:35,125 --> 02:34:37,250
Oh, no. Guruji, please don't mind.

2372
02:34:37,333 --> 02:34:38,250
Sit down.

2373
02:34:38,583 --> 02:34:41,166
- Son, will you agree or not?
- No, Mom.

2374
02:34:41,333 --> 02:34:43,583
- Why?
- Just look into my eyes.

2375
02:34:43,958 --> 02:34:46,625
Look into my eyes.
It's fine. Close your eyes.

2376
02:34:46,708 --> 02:34:48,208
- Close your eyes.
- Please carry on, guruji.

2377
02:34:51,625 --> 02:34:53,375
Don't move.

2378
02:34:53,458 --> 02:34:54,750
Hold her.

2379
02:34:56,875 --> 02:34:58,458
It's over.

2380
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:00,375
Look at how cute she is.

2381
02:35:00,833 --> 02:35:02,833
Now look at her.
Look how cute she is.

2382
02:35:02,916 --> 02:35:03,958
So much drama around this piercing.

2383
02:35:04,083 --> 02:35:05,750
All of you wanted me to be careful.

2384
02:35:05,875 --> 02:35:07,666
And you were saying
that we can do it later.

2385
02:35:07,833 --> 02:35:09,041
What did you name her?
