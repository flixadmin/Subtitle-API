- I don't care anymore.
- Really?

514
00:28:49,844 --> 00:28:51,911
Because he's got a lab
filled with poor people,

515
00:28:51,913 --> 00:28:54,247
and they're all signing waivers
that they don't understand,

516
00:28:54,249 --> 00:28:56,083

like guinea pigs,

517
00:28:56,085 --> 00:28:58,152
and they are dying.

Because it's true.

523
00:29:08,397 --> 00:29:10,164
I believed in him, and I...

524
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:12,099
I told myself
that it was worth it

525
00:29:12,101 --> 00:29:14,269
because we were curing cancer,
but now this is different.

526

- Go to the cops.

527
00:29:15,838 --> 00:29:17,137
I can't do that.

00:29:17,139 --> 00:29:18,940

he's a very powerful man...

I know, I know
how dangerous he is,

531
00:29:22,245 --> 00:29:23,912
because the very first time
I interviewed him,

532
00:29:23,914 --> 00:29:26,114
just once, I lose my job
the very next day.

533
00:29:26,116 --> 00:29:28,484
I lost my career,
I lost my relationship,

534
00:29:28,486 --> 00:29:31,251
I lost my apartment, I lost
everything I ever cared about.
