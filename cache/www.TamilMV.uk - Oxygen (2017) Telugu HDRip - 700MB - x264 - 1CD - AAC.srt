2
00:02:14,223 --> 00:02:17,056
It’s your brother speaking

3
00:02:17,223 --> 00:02:19,973
How come you called at this hour?
Where are you?

4
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,515
I'm in Gajuwaka godown.
Listen to me carefully.

5
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:26,973
Tell me brother. - I found the killer of our son
and son-in-law.

6
00:02:27,723 --> 00:02:29,848
I'll mail you their video clippings.

7
00:02:29,973 --> 00:02:32,556
Show it to our family
and ask them to be careful

8
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,390
Okay. It’s not safe for you to be alone.

9
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:38,598
Shall I send Chalapathi?
- It’s all right. I will take care.

10
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:54,098
Where are you, Srinu?
Someone cut the fencing here.

11
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:03,223
Who must have cut it?

12
00:03:06,723 --> 00:03:08,306
Hey.
- Hey.

13
00:03:11,265 --> 00:03:12,556
Security.

14
00:03:15,556 --> 00:03:17,640
Where the hell are you guys?
Security…

15
00:05:55,515 --> 00:05:57,848
Nothing but ashes is left.

16
00:05:58,181 --> 00:06:00,848
We confirmed it’s your brother’s body
after examining the teeth.

17
00:06:01,015 --> 00:06:02,765
It was a very cruel person
that killed him.

18
00:06:02,806 --> 00:06:06,306
He was killed quite brutally for his age.
I am very sorry, sir.

19
00:06:11,473 --> 00:06:14,015
Veerabhadram must have done this
for sure.

20
00:06:14,348 --> 00:06:18,515
We are in pain and
he is celebrating there

21
00:06:18,723 --> 00:06:21,140
He is not human,
He is a monster.

22
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:25,181
[ Fire crackers bursting ]
- [ Drums sound ]

23
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,181
Come on boys!

24
00:06:32,931 --> 00:06:34,181
What is this noise?

25
00:06:34,306 --> 00:06:36,640
Stop it. Stop it I say.

26
00:06:37,265 --> 00:06:38,390
Brother-in-law,
- Yes.

27
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:40,306
Brother-in-law, have this sweet.
- Is it your birthday today?

28
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:43,848
It’s our enemy’s death day.
That is why we are celebrating.

29
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:47,181
Someone killed Sripathi
in his factory only

30
00:06:48,098 --> 00:06:49,140
Damn! He slapped me.

31
00:06:49,181 --> 00:06:50,181
Idiot.

32
00:06:50,348 --> 00:06:53,306
How is our enmity satisfied
when someone else kills him

33
00:06:54,015 --> 00:06:56,390
Can someone else get married
on your behalf?

34
00:06:56,598 --> 00:06:58,806
Is your hunger fulfilled
when someone else eats?

35
00:06:59,056 --> 00:07:01,890
We should only kill our enemy
- Yes, we should kill him.

36
00:07:02,431 --> 00:07:06,431
I planned everything to kill Sripathi.
But someone else killed before us.

37
00:07:06,848 --> 00:07:10,598
We should only kill anyone related
to Raghupathi’s family.

38
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:13,848
That is when our revenge is sought.
That becomes a celebration for us.

39
00:07:22,931 --> 00:07:24,931
Sir, Mr. Raghupathi is here.

40
00:07:26,723 --> 00:07:27,806
Greetings, sir.
- Greetings.

41
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:29,431
I would have come if you informed.

42
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:33,015
It is not respectful of me to call
a Government officer to me

43
00:07:33,265 --> 00:07:34,473
Take a seat, sir.

44
00:07:36,765 --> 00:07:39,140
I heard about your brother.
I am very sorry, sir

45
00:07:40,056 --> 00:07:41,848
Did you find anything
about the murderer?

46
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:43,223
We are working on it, sir.

47
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,890
Are you suspicious about anyone?

48
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:49,765
We have many businesses.
Business is common in competetion.

49
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:52,931
We don’t realize who is our enemy
and who is our friend.

50
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:56,098
We already lost three lives in our family.

51
00:07:56,765 --> 00:07:59,056
We are not ready to lose another one.

52
00:07:59,515 --> 00:08:02,890
Ask Chalapathi for any
further information.

53
00:08:03,306 --> 00:08:04,473
We'll leave.

54
00:08:04,806 --> 00:08:05,973
Good sir.

55
00:08:16,431 --> 00:08:17,306
Brother…

56
00:08:18,223 --> 00:08:20,473
Auditor has called from Bangalore.

57
00:08:20,681 --> 00:08:23,723
There is a meeting with the foreign clients.
He is asking you to come urgently

58
00:08:25,931 --> 00:08:27,306
Go.
- Ok.

59
00:08:28,015 --> 00:08:28,765
Come.

60
00:08:58,181 --> 00:08:59,515
How far is he?

61
00:08:59,723 --> 00:09:03,306
According to his mobile signals,
he will enter the highway in 10 minutes.

62
00:09:04,098 --> 00:09:06,015
Brother.
- Did you find anything?

63
00:09:06,265 --> 00:09:10,473
You have guessed it right.
Veerabhadram is not connected to the murder

64
00:09:14,015 --> 00:09:15,223
Who must have done it then?

65
00:09:15,348 --> 00:09:19,223
Only two pairs of shoe marks
were found outside the burnt godown.

66
00:09:19,598 --> 00:09:21,015
There are no other clues.

67
00:09:21,431 --> 00:09:23,431
So, two people…

68
00:09:26,348 --> 00:09:28,098
Who are they?

69
00:09:30,181 --> 00:09:33,931
Ganapathi just went out.
Ask him to come back

70
00:09:35,515 --> 00:09:36,556
Get ready.

71
00:09:36,598 --> 00:09:38,473
Ok. - He will be in range
in a minute

72
00:09:51,348 --> 00:09:54,556
Tell me, Chinna.
- Uncle… Dad is calling you home immediately.

73
00:09:54,765 --> 00:09:56,640
Stop the vehicle.

74
00:10:03,515 --> 00:10:04,556
What happened?

75
00:10:05,181 --> 00:10:06,515
He was in our range.

76
00:10:06,681 --> 00:10:09,598
He took a U-turn just before
we were pressing the trigger

77
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,181
No problem. His death is written
somewhere other than the highway.

78
00:10:14,348 --> 00:10:15,140
Let's go.

79
00:10:22,973 --> 00:10:25,640
What is it? I said I had some work
with the auditor.

80
00:10:25,765 --> 00:10:27,265
Why did you call me midway?

81
00:10:29,181 --> 00:10:30,848
I'll speak with the auditor.

82
00:10:31,181 --> 00:10:33,806
Bangalore is not our head office
from now on.

83
00:10:34,598 --> 00:10:35,348
It's our place.

84
00:10:36,015 --> 00:10:38,431
How will we manage
such huge businesses from home?

85
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,390
We have to.

86
00:10:41,806 --> 00:10:43,056
Reduce the volume.
- Dad,

87
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:47,640
Do you want us to stay home
afraid of someone?

88
00:10:47,973 --> 00:10:51,640
Pandavas didn’t go on exile being afraid.
Situations demanded that

89
00:10:51,848 --> 00:10:53,931
I am not afraid like you all assume.

90
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:55,431
It's my responsibility.

91
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:59,515
We have a second enemy
we are not aware of.

92
00:10:59,931 --> 00:11:01,515
But he knows us.

93
00:11:01,806 --> 00:11:04,931
So, let us all stay together
and find out about him.

94
00:11:05,015 --> 00:11:10,098
When will you find out?
You couldn’t find out despite being so rich

95
00:11:10,431 --> 00:11:13,931
How long can we protect
our women at home?

96
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:18,431
Brother-in-law’s wife is a widower already.

97
00:11:19,098 --> 00:11:24,098
Get our daughter married to someone
far away from us.

98
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,556
She would be safe there.

99
00:11:28,015 --> 00:11:30,431
Brother looked for an American alliance
before dying.

100
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:31,890
I liked it too.

101
00:11:32,306 --> 00:11:33,765
The guy is arriving in two days.

102
00:11:34,181 --> 00:11:37,556
He said he would get married
right away if everything goes well

103
00:11:38,015 --> 00:11:38,931
Ok brother.

104
00:11:39,806 --> 00:11:43,306
We will get her married
and send her to America.

105
00:11:43,765 --> 00:11:44,931
Are you happy now?

106
00:11:45,598 --> 00:11:46,848
I'm very happy.

107
00:11:47,765 --> 00:11:49,556
Quickly… Give it.

108
00:12:00,806 --> 00:12:03,473
What? Masala smells great.

109
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:06,098
What are you preparing??
- Eggplant curry.

110
00:12:06,723 --> 00:12:09,223
You have done enough.
Let us do it now.

111
00:12:09,265 --> 00:12:12,515
If anything goes wrong,
uncle would yell at us.

112
00:12:12,556 --> 00:12:16,015
Not possible. I will be cooking today
and you will be eating it

113
00:12:16,223 --> 00:12:18,556
Let her do it. She would have to cook
from tomorrow anyways

114
00:12:19,473 --> 00:12:22,390
Are you going to your mom’s house?
- No...

115
00:12:22,515 --> 00:12:24,015
We are sending you
to your in-law’s house

116
00:12:24,056 --> 00:12:25,056
Like that’s going to happen.

117
00:12:25,306 --> 00:12:29,848
Your dad said a guy is coming to see you
from America in four days

118
00:12:30,348 --> 00:12:32,223
What? Marriage with a guy
from America?

119
00:12:32,306 --> 00:12:33,473
That’s not happening.

120
00:12:33,556 --> 00:12:37,556
I will only marry a guy
who stays here with us.

121
00:12:38,306 --> 00:12:40,765
Tell that to your dad not us.

122
00:12:40,848 --> 00:12:42,848
I will. I am not scared of him.

123
00:12:43,265 --> 00:12:45,765
Brother...
- Aunt... please... don't do it.

124
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,973
That’s right.

125
00:12:49,973 --> 00:12:52,390
How is it, dad? Did I put
too much of anything?

126
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,140
Yes, dear.

127
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:57,223
What is it, dad?
I measured everything

128
00:12:57,681 --> 00:12:59,348
You put too much of taste, dear.

129
00:13:00,098 --> 00:13:03,306
Look mom, she already started cooking well
as we spoke about wedding.

130
00:13:08,431 --> 00:13:09,181
Dad.

131
00:13:10,306 --> 00:13:14,098
I just learnt to cook and
you are already sending me to America

132
00:13:14,306 --> 00:13:16,390
You should get married someday, right?

133
00:13:16,556 --> 00:13:21,098
But when you are in pain here,
how can I lead a happy life there?

134
00:13:21,473 --> 00:13:23,931
It’s not even the neighboring town.
It’s America.

135
00:13:24,056 --> 00:13:27,181
We don’t even know about
the guy’s nature

136
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,306
Oh, Is that your worry?

137
00:13:29,681 --> 00:13:31,056
He is Krishna Prasad.

138
00:13:31,515 --> 00:13:32,890
He is working at Microsoft.

139
00:13:33,265 --> 00:13:35,973
Good salary. But as you would
have to marry him

140
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,765
let us know if you fault him anywhere.

141
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:39,181
We can cancel the alliance.

142
00:13:39,348 --> 00:13:42,431
I will get to know him and tell you. Okay?

143
00:13:43,473 --> 00:13:45,640
You will definitely say
that he is a good guy

144
00:13:48,015 --> 00:13:51,056
Sister, to cancel the alliance
like uncle said,

145
00:13:51,181 --> 00:13:52,723
You should find flaws in the guy

146
00:13:52,931 --> 00:13:55,181
Guys from our town are only flawed
in many ways.

147
00:13:55,265 --> 00:13:58,848
He is coming from America.
He must be greatly flawed.

148
00:13:59,098 --> 00:14:01,390
He might be. But how will you find out?

149
00:14:01,556 --> 00:14:03,848
Savitri uncle will handle it.

150
00:14:07,473 --> 00:14:09,556
Bloody clothes…  I feel irritated.

151
00:14:10,181 --> 00:14:13,973
I might die of suffocation
before the plane arrives.

152
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,765
I will go change and come

153
00:14:15,806 --> 00:14:17,431
Don’t you dare!

154
00:14:17,931 --> 00:14:21,223
You can’t change until the groom arrives.

155
00:14:21,431 --> 00:14:25,140
When will he come? When will
I be out of these clothes?

156
00:14:46,223 --> 00:14:47,140
Sorry, sir.

157
00:14:47,348 --> 00:14:49,348
Swachch Bharat doesn’t mean apologizing
after committing the mistake.

158
00:14:49,473 --> 00:14:51,723
You have to implement it.
That’s when our country will flourish

159
00:14:51,848 --> 00:14:52,681
Ok, sure.

160
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:01,806
You're Mr. Raghupathi’s son Mahendra, right?

161
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:02,973
Yes. And you?

162
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,515
Krishna Prasad.

163
00:15:05,348 --> 00:15:07,265
You're Prasad?

164
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:09,890
Didn’t I tell you
he looked like Prasad?

165
00:15:09,973 --> 00:15:13,806
We expected you to land in a suit.
Your attire confused us a bit.

166
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:16,515
Shake hands with him everyone.
- Thanks.

167
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:18,223
Greetings everyone.

168
00:15:18,931 --> 00:15:22,431
Why are you all in suits?
- We wanted to impress you.

169
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,181
Isn’t it making us all uncomfortable?

170
00:15:25,515 --> 00:15:28,348
Mr. Prasad, give us two minutes.
We will change on our way

171
00:15:29,431 --> 00:15:30,140
Let's go.

172
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,348
Brother… He is great.

173
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:39,056
He could sense our discomfort right away.

174
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,431
All right, get in.
- Ok, brother.

175
00:15:41,098 --> 00:15:43,640
Halt at some hotel on the way.
We will get changed

176
00:15:43,848 --> 00:15:44,556
Ok brother.

177
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:50,409
Go and follow that car

178
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,110
Have you finished the Ragupathi
Son-in-law and Son?

179
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:23,170
No Sir, Only his team was there
in the vehicle!!

180
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,750
Then, where are they?

181
00:16:32,228 --> 00:16:34,645
Our driver isn’t picking up my call.
- He will not.

182
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:35,562
What do you mean?

183
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:36,812
Veerabhadram.

184
00:16:37,603 --> 00:16:39,395
This rail journey is due to that.

185
00:16:40,228 --> 00:16:42,520
Give me that suitcase.
I will hold it

186
00:16:42,645 --> 00:16:45,478
It’s all right. I will carry it.
- Your hands might hurt.

187
00:16:45,562 --> 00:16:47,728
Even my leg hurts.
Will you carry me in your arms?

188
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:49,103
How is that possible?

189
00:16:49,228 --> 00:16:50,728
That is why you should stick
to your work.

190
00:16:50,812 --> 00:16:52,978
What is it now?
You want to carry something heavy, right?

191
00:16:53,103 --> 00:16:53,978
Uncle…
- What, son?

192
00:16:54,062 --> 00:16:54,853
Give it to me. Here…

193
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:56,645
Why do you strain yourself?

194
00:16:56,937 --> 00:16:59,228
Lift it. Happy now? Come…

195
00:17:02,937 --> 00:17:05,187
Are they coming?
- Yes. They are

196
00:17:06,812 --> 00:17:08,853
Hey, where's your seat?

197
00:17:14,937 --> 00:17:16,353
Put the bag under our seats.

198
00:17:26,603 --> 00:17:29,395
Isn’t he handsome?
- That’s not enough.

199
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,395
He should be more than that.
- What else?

200
00:17:31,645 --> 00:17:33,562
He has the discipline
to mind his own business.

201
00:17:33,728 --> 00:17:35,937
He has all the traditional values
of a family man.

202
00:17:36,103 --> 00:17:37,770
He respects elders.

203
00:17:37,978 --> 00:17:39,895
Looks like he can’t be faulted.

204
00:17:40,062 --> 00:17:42,562
You can’t say that.
Savitri uncle will decide.

205
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:45,020
That is why uncle told us to come here.

206
00:17:46,395 --> 00:17:48,353
Train is moving. Where is Savitri uncle?

207
00:17:52,062 --> 00:17:54,395
Dear, come fast...

208

Come fast

209

211
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:02,812
Give me your hands.

212

Thanks aunty.
- He is my husband.

213
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,687
Is it? Hello.

214
00:18:08,228 --> 00:18:10,812
You left your husband for me, right?
- Damn! you..

215
00:18:10,895 --> 00:18:12,312
He is your husband at the end of the day.

216
00:18:12,437 --> 00:18:15,312
Get down at the next station
and come together. Thanks

217
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,687
Uncle, you are right on time.

218
00:18:17,853 --> 00:18:20,520
The moment I arrive at is the right time.

219
00:18:21,478 --> 00:18:24,228
Where is he?
- He is the one in the dhoti.

220
00:18:25,937 --> 00:18:29,478
Oh... He looks quite innocent.

221
00:18:29,812 --> 00:18:33,103
I will expose the wild angle in him.

222
00:18:33,937 --> 00:18:35,228
Switch on your camera.

223
00:18:35,353 --> 00:18:38,145
I will show it to everyone at home
and get the wedding cancelled

224

Are you just coming casually?
- No. I have some work.

227

Hello, Mr. Krishna Prasad…

233
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:12,603
He came to meet our Sruthi
from America

234
00:19:12,687 --> 00:19:14,853
I can make it out from his look.

235
00:19:15,812 --> 00:19:17,478
So… You're from America…

236
00:19:17,645 --> 00:19:19,853
Yes.
- Which part of America?

New York.

238

You're a software engineer, right?

239
00:19:23,603 --> 00:19:27,478
He is speaking fluent Telugu
though he is from America.

240
00:19:28,103 --> 00:19:31,437
You were born and brought up here
but you are speaking in English

241
00:19:31,687 --> 00:19:34,437
When will our country develop
with these ideologies?

It’s okay. Try once.
Smoke one.

If I start smoking,
I don’t stop with one.

You wasted 150 rupees.

Two girlfriends.

262
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:36,020
One being my job
and two being the girl in my life

to get a girl like Goddess Sita

- They are pop singers.

I was fed up with their music.
I wanted to listen to some Telugu melodies

"The taste of coconut water beats it all"

318
00:24:50,562 --> 00:24:57,187
"Standing high above everyone,
Is the intelligence of gultis"

319
00:24:57,895 --> 00:25:04,353
"There is no hint of doubt in saying,
This land has some luster about it"

320
00:25:04,728 --> 00:25:11,478
"It must be a foreign scent,
It must be spilling fragrances"

321
00:25:11,812 --> 00:25:17,603
"It’s no greater than motherland,
And the petrichor it presents"

322
00:25:37,312 --> 00:25:39,603
Hey… Stop the vehicle…
Stop it, stop it.

323
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:48,937
What happened?
- Someone bashed him and left.

324
00:25:50,312 --> 00:25:51,728
Hold him, Hold him.
- Ok.

325
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:58,353
Open that door.
- Sir, Sir...

326
00:25:58,812 --> 00:26:01,103
Sir, we can’t get all these bodies
into the car.

327
00:26:01,228 --> 00:26:03,312
My owner will sue me if there’s blood
on the covers

328
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:06,187
We should take him to the hospital
urgently to save him

329
00:26:08,478 --> 00:26:11,103
Get the vehicle cleaned
and covers changed.

330
00:26:11,312 --> 00:26:13,687
Learn some humanity if possible.
Save him.

331
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:17,937
Hey… You guys go along with him.

332
00:26:18,187 --> 00:26:20,520
Take care of him.
- Ok brother.

333
00:26:22,187 --> 00:26:23,145
Let's go.

334
00:26:27,937 --> 00:26:31,353
Sruthi, he looks like
an embodiment of humility.

335
00:26:31,478 --> 00:26:32,937
You're going to America for sure.

336
00:26:32,978 --> 00:26:35,478
I have many ads to shoot in Hyderabad.
I'll leave.

337
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,812
I will add 50K to what you asked.
- Then I'll come with you.

338
00:26:39,395 --> 00:26:40,812
Move. I will give you 100 bucks.

339
00:26:51,478 --> 00:26:52,770
Hey… Come here.

340
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,728
Put the suitcase inside.

341
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,270
Greetings.
- Greetings.

342
00:27:00,395 --> 00:27:02,395
What’s all this blood?
What happened?

343
00:27:03,645 --> 00:27:04,770
Dad… Actually…

344
00:27:04,853 --> 00:27:08,020
Why are you questioning him
at the door?

345
00:27:08,895 --> 00:27:10,478
Invite him in to the house.

346
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:11,728
Mr. Prasad…

347
00:27:12,187 --> 00:27:13,812
My dad...
- Greetings. - Greetings.

348
00:27:13,853 --> 00:27:15,020
My mom.
- Greetings.

349
00:27:15,228 --> 00:27:16,395
Please come inside.

350
00:27:17,728 --> 00:27:19,603
- Greetings, come in.
- Greetings, come in.

351
00:27:20,312 --> 00:27:21,312
What happened?

352
00:27:21,645 --> 00:27:22,228
Let's go.

353
00:27:22,312 --> 00:27:24,395
Actually...
- Please come inside.

354
00:27:24,562 --> 00:27:25,520
Hey, come here.

355
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:27,062
What happened?

356
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,770
Oh no...
- I'm very tired.

357
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:47,603
You have travelled for a long time.
Do you want to rest for a while?

358
00:27:47,978 --> 00:27:51,312
It’s all right, uncle. Let’s be done
with the alliance

359
00:27:51,895 --> 00:27:52,978
What? Right now?

360
00:27:53,312 --> 00:27:55,603
He is right on his part.

361
00:27:57,437 --> 00:27:59,478
Sit, dear. I will bring the girl

362
00:27:59,645 --> 00:28:00,603
Please sit.

363
00:28:03,728 --> 00:28:04,937
Move aside...

364
00:28:05,437 --> 00:28:08,270
Savitri, you came right on time.

365
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:10,353
Hello, brother-in-law…
[ Chuckles ]

366
00:28:10,645 --> 00:28:13,187
Come on, Savitri. We can’t be missing you.
- Right.

367
00:28:13,478 --> 00:28:15,228
You wait, dear. Give me that tray.

368
00:28:15,437 --> 00:28:16,770
Take the bag.

369
00:28:17,103 --> 00:28:19,353
I will take care of Sruthi’s alliance.

370
00:28:20,937 --> 00:28:24,603
Burger, pizza, sandwich, coke, French fries…
What would you like, dear?

371
00:28:26,228 --> 00:28:27,520
I don’t want any of that.
- Then what do you want?

372
00:28:27,562 --> 00:28:30,978
I want all the Indian delicacies.

373
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,978
Have you come from Amalapuram or America?

374
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,645
Hey Savitri… He always talks crap

375
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:38,103
Me?
- Savitri.

376
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:41,020
Sruthi is coming. Calm down.
- Come, I have some work with you.

377
00:28:52,895 --> 00:28:55,145
Dear… My daughter, Sruthi…

378
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,853
I know, uncle.
I saw her in the train.

379
00:29:08,895 --> 00:29:11,062
He scored a 100 in brilliance too.

380
00:29:11,645 --> 00:29:12,437
Yes.

381
00:29:12,562 --> 00:29:15,812
A little girl was sitting in a traditional attire
in the train.

382
00:29:16,145 --> 00:29:19,353
Your daughter reminds me
of that little girl.

383
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,687
Well said!

384
00:29:26,437 --> 00:29:28,728
She seems like a little girl to us too.

385
00:29:28,937 --> 00:29:31,187
So, does this come under child marriage?
Court wouldn’t approve it, right?

386
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,562
Savitri.

387
00:29:33,812 --> 00:29:35,728
My son spoke very high of you,

388
00:29:36,228 --> 00:29:38,312
Your words, habits and principles.

389
00:29:38,645 --> 00:29:39,937
We liked it a lot.

390
00:29:40,937 --> 00:29:43,395
If you like our daughter.
- Come on.

391
00:29:43,812 --> 00:29:47,478
I feel fortunate to become your son-in-law

392
00:29:48,103 --> 00:29:48,978
That’s great.

393
00:29:49,728 --> 00:29:50,937
That’s really great.

394
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,353
Priest.

395
00:29:55,145 --> 00:29:58,978
The auspicious timing is
at 8 am on Thursday.

396
00:29:59,145 --> 00:30:02,395
It brings great fortune to the couple.

397
00:30:02,562 --> 00:30:05,020
Wedding in two days?
- We want you to be safe.

398
00:30:05,228 --> 00:30:06,728
But I will not be happy.

399
00:30:06,812 --> 00:30:09,437
Son, the wedding will be in 2 days.

400
00:30:09,728 --> 00:30:12,270
Are you fine with it?
- I'm fine with it.

401
00:30:12,562 --> 00:30:14,562
But I have to ask my parents once.

402
00:30:17,603 --> 00:30:19,353
He doesn't have parents, right?

403
00:30:20,812 --> 00:30:24,770
Mom, are you happy with me
marrying this girl?

404
00:30:26,978 --> 00:30:27,645
Ok.

405
00:30:28,187 --> 00:30:29,562
Dad, do you agree?

406
00:30:30,853 --> 00:30:32,062
Remove your hand.

407
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:35,395
You shouldn’t complain about
the little time available.

408
00:30:35,645 --> 00:30:36,687
Tell me properly.

409
00:30:38,145 --> 00:30:39,562
Are you both fine with it?

410
00:30:40,812 --> 00:30:42,812
My parents are fine with it.

411
00:30:44,145 --> 00:30:45,312
It’s madness.

412
00:30:45,395 --> 00:30:47,312
This is called social physical disorder.

413
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,270
What is this?

414
00:30:48,353 --> 00:30:50,270
You are getting her married
to a crazy fellow.

415
00:30:50,395 --> 00:30:52,103
What the hell are you saying, Savitri?

416
00:30:52,312 --> 00:30:54,228
It’s not his fault to say that.

417
00:30:54,937 --> 00:30:57,520
You all know I don’t have parents.

418
00:30:58,103 --> 00:31:02,020
But I think of my parents every time
I do something important.

419
00:31:02,312 --> 00:31:06,353
I imagine them being right with me
and tell me what’s in my heart.

420
00:31:06,895 --> 00:31:08,478
They might not be with me

421
00:31:09,228 --> 00:31:12,478
But I believe their blessings
are always with me.

422
00:31:14,728 --> 00:31:18,270
If I caused you any discomfort.

423
00:31:18,395 --> 00:31:20,562
Not at all.
- Don’t ever think that.

424
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:23,603
When people don’t even bother
about parents these days.

425
00:31:24,395 --> 00:31:28,228
After seeing a guy like you
it makes me really happy.

426
00:31:29,562 --> 00:31:33,228
My daughter is really lucky
to be your wife. Isn’t it?

427
00:31:36,312 --> 00:31:39,103
I didn’t know he was a parents lover.

428
00:31:39,395 --> 00:31:41,520
You know it now.
Apologize to him.

429
00:31:44,437 --> 00:31:46,603
Sorry… He asked me to apologize
and I did it.

430
00:31:46,895 --> 00:31:48,853
No... I didn't feel bad.

431
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:49,603
Ok.

432
00:31:49,687 --> 00:31:50,770
But...

433
00:31:51,687 --> 00:31:54,145
But my parents were hurt
When you called me crazy.

434
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:55,645
Just apologize to them.

435
00:31:56,103 --> 00:31:58,103
How do I apologize to people
I can’t see?

436
00:31:58,312 --> 00:32:00,770
Though you can’t see them,
they can hear you.

437
00:32:00,812 --> 00:32:02,228
They will receive your apology.
- Receive?

438
00:32:02,395 --> 00:32:03,478
They will receive it?

439
00:32:04,853 --> 00:32:06,145
Which side is your mom?

440
00:32:08,187 --> 00:32:09,687
I am sorry, mom.

441
00:32:12,062 --> 00:32:14,062
Dad? Sir, Sorry.

442
00:32:14,728 --> 00:32:15,520
Happy?

443
00:32:25,437 --> 00:32:27,103
There’s hardly two days left
for the wedding.

444
00:32:27,562 --> 00:32:30,187
Wedding arrangements have to be grand.
Get going everyone.

445
00:32:30,645 --> 00:32:33,853
Wedding has been fixed with the American,
Wedding is in two days.

446
00:32:33,937 --> 00:32:38,603
I thought no one would dare to be her groom
after killing the previous one

447
00:32:38,895 --> 00:32:41,437
Seems he will go to America immediately
after the wedding

448
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:45,228
Raghupathi should not have any celebrations
except death in his house.

449
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,770
We have to stop that wedding.

450
00:32:47,187 --> 00:32:48,770
What will you do, sir?
How will you stop the wedding?

451
00:32:48,853 --> 00:32:51,062
The wedding arrangements are going on
like a country fair

452
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:53,603
What did you say?

453
00:32:54,103 --> 00:32:56,312
Wedding arrangements?
- Are going like a country fair…

454
00:32:56,478 --> 00:32:57,187
That means...

455
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:00,395
If there is fair in town,
wedding wouldn’t happen.

456
00:33:01,687 --> 00:33:05,603
Pray to the Goddess and announce
this all over the town

457
00:33:06,062 --> 00:33:08,478
[ Priests chanting ]

458
00:33:24,103 --> 00:33:25,770
Isn’t the religious fair supposed
to be in next month?

459
00:33:25,978 --> 00:33:28,353
That’s what we did last time.
Tell them brother.

460
00:33:28,437 --> 00:33:30,853
Mr. Veerabhadram will be performing
all the duties this time

461
00:33:30,937 --> 00:33:34,603
He has tied the holy thread
to the Goddess without informing us.

462
00:33:34,978 --> 00:33:37,895
Why do we have to stop
our sister’s marriage for that?

463
00:33:38,853 --> 00:33:42,395
Once the holy knot has been tied,
the religious fair cannot be halted.

464
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,228
That’s our village custom.

465
00:33:44,603 --> 00:33:45,687
It doesn’t stop at that.

466
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:48,103
No auspicious occasions can take place
in the village until the fair comes to an end

467
00:33:48,187 --> 00:33:50,687
You can have the wedding
after three weeks

468
00:33:51,312 --> 00:33:53,520
I have no objection to postpone
the wedding

469
00:33:54,187 --> 00:33:56,145
I am worried about
son-in-law’s reaction. - Uncle.

470
00:33:58,645 --> 00:34:02,228
when I become a member of your family,
I become a part of this village too.

471
00:34:02,395 --> 00:34:04,437
We need to honor our customs.

472
00:34:04,562 --> 00:34:07,937
And it’s been long since I visited a fair.

473
00:34:07,978 --> 00:34:10,603
It’s all right, uncle. I will wait.
- That’s good, son.

00:34:11,645 --> 00:34:13,228
We are leaving.

475

Three weeks time.
- Anything might happen.

476
00:34:17,437 --> 00:34:20,603
We can prove that he is a bad guy.
- Or he might be exposed as a bad guy

477
00:34:20,812 --> 00:34:21,978
Anything is good for us.

478
00:34:22,103 --> 00:34:23,937
But he has to go back to America alone.

479
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,770
If that happens, I will offer 100 coconuts
in the name of Goddess

480
00:34:26,853 --> 00:34:29,103
Do  what ever you want,
but give me some money first.

481
00:34:29,187 --> 00:34:30,020
Give him.

The specialty of this year’s religious fair
is offering their lives to the Goddess.

485
00:34:52,474 --> 00:34:53,891
Go and work on that.

this marriage at any cost.

Take care of son-in-law.

488
00:35:08,307 --> 00:35:11,141
He shouldn’t get to know this.

489
00:35:50,516 --> 00:35:52,891
Brother, shall we click a selfie with them?
- Yes sure.

490
00:35:52,974 --> 00:35:55,932
You're taking selfies with their pictures,
But I directly took a picture with them.

491
00:35:56,057 --> 00:35:57,807
Hello, come here.

492
00:35:57,932 --> 00:35:59,349
Why?
- My dad is standing there.

493

Who? This guy?
- Don't overact. I'll beat you.

494
00:36:12,641 --> 00:36:14,141
Uncle, it looks great.

495

Do you know what adds beauty to women?
- What else? Makeup…

Not at all. you tell us.

499

Vermillion on the forehead
and bangles on the hands…

500
00:36:32,182 --> 00:36:34,224
I really like bangles.
- Is it?

501
00:36:34,307 --> 00:36:35,682
Then you wear them.

502
00:36:36,182 --> 00:36:39,224
Show me some good bangles.
- I don’t like bangles.

503

Sruthi, he wants you to wear them.
Do it

504
00:36:42,974 --> 00:36:44,682
Why are you supporting him?

505
00:36:44,807 --> 00:36:47,391
Sruthi, your brother really
likes you a lot.

506
00:36:47,641 --> 00:36:50,057
He takes good care of me
as I should look after you really well.

507
00:36:50,224 --> 00:36:52,224
It's my fortune to find such a brother.

508
00:36:52,682 --> 00:36:53,974
All right. Give me.

Do they look good?
- Yes, really good.

Let's go.

Brother-in-law, Will you get me ice cream?
- Yes.

513
00:37:17,641 --> 00:37:18,724
Will you have some too?

514
00:37:18,891 --> 00:37:20,932
- Yes. - Do you want it on a cone
or a stick?

515
00:37:21,016 --> 00:37:22,266
All this is new to you guys.

516

All this seems rubbish to me.

Give me three ice cream sticks.

518
00:37:43,099 --> 00:37:45,224
So, it's two.

My target missed.
What about yours?

520
00:37:54,432 --> 00:37:57,432
My target is right on him.
- Then finish him.

521

Tastes good. You want to try one more?
- Brother-in-law.

I will send him directly to God
the next time.

How did the fair go?
- It went well.

Come. Let’s eat.
- Come on, son.

You will get married and settle in America.
It’s a single time settlement

I can’t pay you the amount
you are demanding.

542
00:39:54,349 --> 00:39:56,224
I gave you a lot of money already

543
00:39:56,349 --> 00:39:58,557
I agree I made some mistakes
in my childhood

544
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:00,599
You did huge mistakes in your childhood.

545
00:40:00,682 --> 00:40:02,349
You must have forgotten them.

Romance with Needles Sudhakar
in the coconut field in the tenth grade…

He gifted me a mobile back then, uncle.

548
00:40:10,849 --> 00:40:13,766
If he gifts you a mobile,
you should shake hands and thank him

549
00:40:13,849 --> 00:40:16,432
But not kiss him and provoke him.

550

In the engineering college,

You worked out your chemistry
with Manthena Diwakar in the physics lab

That day I was drunk, uncle.

555
00:40:33,349 --> 00:40:37,266
You committed mistakes in a flow.
- And I started blackmailing slowly.

556
00:40:37,974 --> 00:40:40,807
What have you paid me after all?
Just 3 million rupees.

557

Isn’t that enough?

558

It's not enough.

5 million rupees.
- 5 million rupees?

563

I don’t have so much money.
- You don't have the money?

564
00:40:57,099 --> 00:40:59,224
I will immediately tell him then.

565
00:40:59,307 --> 00:41:04,682
Any guy with a conscience
would never marry you.

566
00:41:05,391 --> 00:41:08,432
Oh no... uncle, I'm begging you

567
00:41:08,641 --> 00:41:11,099
Please don’t ruin this marriage.
Please uncle.

Have you heard everything?
- Yes.

570
00:41:19,016 --> 00:41:19,682
I see.

Am I the fourth guy?

Very good. You're good at math.

Don’t shout and expose her image
and ruin my earnings

Don’t book a flight ticket
in a hurry and leave

One minute.

My house number in America is four.

582
00:41:45,224 --> 00:41:48,099
My car number is four.
My date of birth is four.

583
00:41:48,557 --> 00:41:52,141
It’s a coincidence that my number
in your life is also four.

584
00:41:53,974 --> 00:41:57,099
The mistakes made at a tender age

585
00:41:57,432 --> 00:41:58,891
How can you misunderstand her?

586
00:41:59,057 --> 00:42:00,182
With those mistakes...

587
00:42:00,266 --> 00:42:02,932
Let's us differentiate
between good and bad people.

588
00:42:04,224 --> 00:42:05,516
That’s not my worry.

589
00:42:05,724 --> 00:42:07,224
All these years he's been
blackmailing you,

590

Has been mentally torturing you
for money.

591

Your Savitri uncle.

592
00:42:12,016 --> 00:42:13,891
He committed a very big crime.

593
00:42:14,182 --> 00:42:17,224
If this was America, he would be
in prison for 600 years

594
00:42:17,557 --> 00:42:20,391
But he can’t threaten you anymore.

595
00:42:20,807 --> 00:42:23,599
I recorded everything in my mobile.
- What? recording?

596
00:42:23,682 --> 00:42:27,599
I will play this to your dad, uncle
and brother in a home theatre

597
00:42:27,807 --> 00:42:29,266
Home theatre?
- Why?

598
00:42:29,307 --> 00:42:31,307
Shall I play it in Alankar theatre?
The entire village can watch it.

599
00:42:31,349 --> 00:42:33,641
Bro, I am pleading you.

600
00:42:33,682 --> 00:42:36,599
Please forgive me. I didn’t know
your lucky number was four.

601
00:42:36,849 --> 00:42:38,516
Not possible. - They kill me
if you show them the video.

602
00:42:38,849 --> 00:42:42,307
This should be a lesson to every uncle
teasing his nephew

603
00:42:42,432 --> 00:42:44,682
This family will rip my skin off.
- They should.

604
00:42:45,141 --> 00:42:47,641
Have you looked at her innocent face?
- Her face?

605
00:42:47,724 --> 00:42:49,391
She was begging you.

606
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:51,141
Did I ask you to cry? Did I?

607
00:42:51,224 --> 00:42:52,766
She over acted, sir.

608
00:42:53,099 --> 00:42:55,432
Prasad, you're a true gentleman.

609
00:42:55,641 --> 00:42:59,599
But family members would feel bad
if they know about it.

610
00:42:59,932 --> 00:43:02,849
Let him go. He will face his fate.

611
00:43:02,932 --> 00:43:03,807
Please.

612
00:43:04,182 --> 00:43:04,932
All right.

613
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,766
For safety purpose
I am keeping the video with me

614
00:43:08,682 --> 00:43:09,682
What about you?
- I will shut everything.

615
00:43:09,766 --> 00:43:11,099
- That's right.
- Thank you bro.

616
00:43:11,766 --> 00:43:12,516
Thank god.

617
00:43:12,682 --> 00:43:14,557
Pack your bags. You're definitely
going to America

618
00:43:14,682 --> 00:43:16,974
- I don’t want him.
- He won’t leave you.

619
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:22,349
Hello.

620
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:24,557
This is commissioner speaking.
- Tell me.

621
00:43:24,682 --> 00:43:27,641
While we were investigating
at the fair earlier, we found a bullet.

622
00:43:27,932 --> 00:43:30,391
It was shot from a high precision rifle.

623
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:33,391
The accuracy range is 900 to 1200 meters.

624
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:37,099
It means, we can shoot our target
from a distance of one kilometer.

625
00:43:37,432 --> 00:43:39,474
This is definitely a professional killer’s work.

626
00:43:39,557 --> 00:43:40,474
Because...

627
00:43:40,599 --> 00:43:45,224
There is no one in our State
who could handle such rifle.

628
00:43:46,641 --> 00:43:50,391
If I guessed it right,
murderer is definitely a foreigner

629
00:43:50,932 --> 00:43:52,557
Are you giving me information?

630
00:43:52,891 --> 00:43:55,057
Or warning me to be alert?

631
00:43:55,474 --> 00:44:01,057
Murderer is making sure
he doesn’t leave any clue behind

632
00:44:01,182 --> 00:44:02,391
They won't get caught.

633
00:44:02,932 --> 00:44:04,474
We would have to plan and catch them.

634
00:44:04,849 --> 00:44:06,974
You have to show me further
development in this case

635
00:44:07,391 --> 00:44:10,391
Otherwise, I would have to meet
your higher authorities

636
00:44:11,557 --> 00:44:12,474
Ok sir.

637
00:44:16,432 --> 00:44:17,224
Sir.

638
00:44:19,057 --> 00:44:20,891
Whom do you have to meet?
- Sir.

639
00:44:20,974 --> 00:44:21,974
Which sir?

640
00:44:22,391 --> 00:44:23,682
I don’t know his name.

641
00:44:23,766 --> 00:44:25,974
But I can recognize him.
He saved my life.

642
00:44:26,141 --> 00:44:28,057
Tell me properly.
- Whom do you have to meet?

643
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:30,891
That guy talking on the phone…
It's him.

644
00:44:32,099 --> 00:44:32,849
Sir.

645
00:44:33,432 --> 00:44:35,016
Hey! Hey!

646
00:44:35,141 --> 00:44:35,932
Stop.

647
00:44:36,266 --> 00:44:37,974
Some stranger is here.
catch him.

648
00:44:38,057 --> 00:44:39,391
Don't leave him.
hold him.

649
00:44:39,432 --> 00:44:40,766
Stop him right there.

650
00:44:54,724 --> 00:44:56,724
Do you know him?
- Who is he?

651
00:44:57,224 --> 00:45:00,307
I am Naresh, sir.
Research student from Chennai IIT.

652
00:45:00,391 --> 00:45:01,266
Why did you come here?

653
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:05,516
I was lying on the road dieing
and sir saved my life

654
00:45:05,807 --> 00:45:08,641
Yes, brother. Son-in-law saved this guy.

655
00:45:09,891 --> 00:45:12,307
I'm forever in his debt.

656
00:45:12,516 --> 00:45:16,016
That is why I want to name
my thesis after him

657
00:45:16,224 --> 00:45:18,474
I just came to find out his name.
That’s all.

658
00:45:18,641 --> 00:45:20,766
He would have been almost dead.

659
00:45:21,307 --> 00:45:22,807
Do you even know
the value of life?

660
00:45:23,141 --> 00:45:25,557
Abdul Kalam's life is dedicated
to respect the country.

661
00:45:26,266 --> 00:45:28,141
NTR's life was about self respect.

662
00:45:28,932 --> 00:45:30,974
Mother Teresa's life
is the respect of motherhood.

663
00:45:31,724 --> 00:45:34,766
Even the driver who takes us home safe
also has a life

664
00:45:34,974 --> 00:45:36,349
How could you end a life
so easily?

665
00:45:36,807 --> 00:45:37,932
It's our mistake.

666
00:45:38,349 --> 00:45:39,391
I'm so sorry.

667
00:45:39,516 --> 00:45:41,974
He is a scientist.
Apologize to him everyone

668
00:45:42,099 --> 00:45:43,349
[ Goons ] Sorry brother.

669
00:45:43,682 --> 00:45:44,724
Sorry brother.

670
00:45:44,932 --> 00:45:47,432
Drop our scientist broher in the car.
- Ok bro.

671
00:45:47,557 --> 00:45:48,724
One minute, son.

672
00:45:53,182 --> 00:45:55,807
You are naming your thesis
after my son-in-law, right?

673
00:45:57,891 --> 00:45:59,391
He is Krishna Prasad.

674
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:00,516
Ok sir.

675
00:46:00,724 --> 00:46:04,807
If you don’t mind, you are free
to work in our research lab

676
00:46:05,099 --> 00:46:05,974
Ok sir.

677
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:10,266
Thanks, uncle.

678
00:46:18,516 --> 00:46:20,307
He is doing a bit much.

679
00:46:20,349 --> 00:46:23,641
No. He is preceding everyone.

680
00:46:25,266 --> 00:46:29,141
I will end this in the coconut fields
tomorrow

681
00:46:29,224 --> 00:46:31,224
- What will you do?
- You will see.

682
00:46:34,974 --> 00:46:37,266
We should empty the coconut
and pour some vodka in it.

683
00:46:37,349 --> 00:46:38,724
- What are you doing, uncle?
- This is wine.

684
00:46:38,891 --> 00:46:40,516
This Jin and then some Rum.

685
00:46:41,849 --> 00:46:43,266
What’s happening now?

686
00:46:43,474 --> 00:46:47,182
If you drink one of these,
the inner person comes out.

687
00:46:47,391 --> 00:46:51,391
If he drinks this cocktail.
He will dance.

688
00:46:51,766 --> 00:46:55,474
From today, he will be scared to touch
even a glass of water

689
00:46:57,391 --> 00:46:59,932
- What's this for?
-  It covers up the smell.

690
00:47:00,099 --> 00:47:02,057
- You are great, uncle.
- I am always great.

691
00:47:02,141 --> 00:47:03,391
Do you want to try? No?

692
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:05,182
Did you like this coconut field?

693
00:47:05,432 --> 00:47:06,141
Yes.

694
00:47:06,266 --> 00:47:07,141
What’s so special here?

695
00:47:07,224 --> 00:47:10,057
I planted all these trees
when I was a kid.

696
00:47:10,307 --> 00:47:11,349
- Really?
- Yes.

697
00:47:11,391 --> 00:47:13,307
I should definitely drink
few coconuts then

698
00:47:13,391 --> 00:47:16,724
You should drink, spill the truth
and run from the village.

699
00:47:16,849 --> 00:47:17,891
Let’s go.

700
00:47:18,182 --> 00:47:19,057
They reached.
- Savitri uncle.

701
00:47:19,141 --> 00:47:20,057
Is everything ready?
- Alcohol is ready.

702
00:47:20,099 --> 00:47:20,724
Alcohol?

703
00:47:20,849 --> 00:47:22,474
I meant everything is ready to drink.

704
00:47:23,307 --> 00:47:24,391
Switch on the camera.

705
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:27,141
Here, take this.

706
00:47:27,724 --> 00:47:28,724
It's good have it.

707
00:47:29,182 --> 00:47:30,724
They are here on time.

708
00:47:32,432 --> 00:47:35,224
Video isn’t necessary.
We can catch him LIVE

709
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:36,807
Looks like you guys are enjoying.

710
00:47:37,307 --> 00:47:39,057
Have you been around the field?

711
00:47:39,141 --> 00:47:40,974
Your sister has shown me
the entire field

712
00:47:41,557 --> 00:47:44,016
You look really tired.
Have this coconut first

713
00:47:44,557 --> 00:47:45,266
Drink it.

714
00:47:45,474 --> 00:47:47,432
I'm fine. We drink every day.

715
00:47:47,557 --> 00:47:48,099
You have it.

716
00:47:48,307 --> 00:47:49,766
So you won't drink
if I offer you a coconut.

717
00:47:49,891 --> 00:47:51,849
That's a big word,
give it to me.

718
00:47:51,932 --> 00:47:54,099
Uncle, please don’t drink it.

719
00:47:54,516 --> 00:47:55,766
Oh...

720
00:47:55,891 --> 00:47:57,807
Sruthi, I get it.

721
00:47:57,932 --> 00:48:00,641
You want to drink as he is offering it.

722
00:48:00,724 --> 00:48:02,682
All right. You offer her, son

723
00:48:02,849 --> 00:48:03,557
Drink it.

724
00:48:04,391 --> 00:48:06,391
Drink dear.
- If you are behaving like this now.

725
00:48:06,807 --> 00:48:08,516
Looks like you will totally forget us
after your wedding

726
00:48:09,974 --> 00:48:10,807
Take it.

727
00:48:12,307 --> 00:48:13,932
What are you looking at?
Have it.

728
00:48:14,432 --> 00:48:16,224
Drink dear.
Don't be shy, have it.

729
00:48:17,516 --> 00:48:18,932
It’s a body coolant. Have it.

730
00:48:21,224 --> 00:48:22,557
They are talking to you.

731
00:48:23,016 --> 00:48:24,141
Coconuts up.

732
00:48:24,224 --> 00:48:25,807
Coconuts up it seems… Have it.

733
00:48:39,641 --> 00:48:41,682
Do you want one more?
- No.

734
00:48:43,516 --> 00:48:45,891
Brother, there is no fault
in our hospitality, right?

735
00:48:46,141 --> 00:48:47,807
Not at all. Everything is fine.

736
00:48:48,099 --> 00:48:50,057
Let us know if there is any.
We will try correcting it

737
00:48:50,141 --> 00:48:51,974
Come on sir.
- Mr. America.

738
00:48:52,057 --> 00:48:55,682
Talk about anything
but not the video.

739
00:48:56,307 --> 00:48:57,057
Which video?

740
00:48:57,474 --> 00:49:02,224
The video you shot on your mobile
while Savitri uncle was blackmailing me.

741
00:49:03,266 --> 00:49:06,182
She asked us not to reveal it
but she is only spilling everything

742
00:49:06,266 --> 00:49:08,641
What happened?
Nothing. It’s nothing.

743
00:49:08,974 --> 00:49:10,849
Why do you say that?

744
00:49:11,224 --> 00:49:13,932
The video has it all.
- Give me.

745
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:17,641
Looks like tomorrow is going
to be death cremation along with the wedding.

746
00:49:21,432 --> 00:49:23,182
What is this?
- Nothing.

747
00:49:23,391 --> 00:49:24,724
She is drunk, don't mind her words.

748
00:49:25,391 --> 00:49:26,016
Hey.

749
00:49:26,599 --> 00:49:28,307
Inspite of blackmailing my sister,

750
00:49:28,599 --> 00:49:30,307
You are accusing her of getting drunk.
- Oh no.

751
00:49:30,474 --> 00:49:31,682
Mahendra.
- Oh no.

752
00:49:32,516 --> 00:49:34,724
Why did you hit him like that?
- What do you expect?

753
00:49:35,932 --> 00:49:37,057
You should hit like this.

754
00:49:39,974 --> 00:49:41,724
Oh no.

755
00:49:42,682 --> 00:49:44,016
Stop it.

756
00:49:44,182 --> 00:49:45,474
I'm begging you.

757
00:49:45,557 --> 00:49:46,724
What happened?

758
00:49:46,849 --> 00:49:48,349
Enough. he will die.
let him go.

759
00:49:52,266 --> 00:49:54,516
Oh no...
Savitri uncle…

760
00:49:54,641 --> 00:49:55,974
I helped you
and you got me beaten up.

761
00:49:56,057 --> 00:49:58,016
We are no way related
to each other now.

762
00:49:58,182 --> 00:50:00,266
I will get you married.

763
00:50:00,516 --> 00:50:02,391
Do whatever you want can.

764
00:50:04,891 --> 00:50:06,599
Sister, do you realize
what you are doing?

765
00:50:06,891 --> 00:50:08,432
No one can stop your wedding now.

766
00:50:16,266 --> 00:50:17,432
I need to talk to you.

767
00:50:22,557 --> 00:50:23,932
I don’t like this marriage.

768
00:50:24,182 --> 00:50:25,182
What happened?

769
00:50:25,891 --> 00:50:28,766
I wanted to fault you at something
and have the wedding cancelled.

770
00:50:28,891 --> 00:50:30,182
But I couldn’t do it.

771
00:50:30,474 --> 00:50:33,391
I agree… You are a very good guy.

772
00:50:33,724 --> 00:50:36,307
But a good guy shouldn’t
just have good habits.

773
00:50:36,516 --> 00:50:38,432
He should also understand
the heart of the opposite.

774
00:50:38,599 --> 00:50:40,807
You're really selfish in my opinion.

775
00:50:41,432 --> 00:50:43,099
You don’t have parents.

776
00:50:43,391 --> 00:50:45,766
I have a large family
along with my parents.

777
00:50:46,224 --> 00:50:49,891
How can I be happy with you,
leaving my entire family behind?

778
00:50:50,182 --> 00:50:52,391
If you really know the value of parents,

779
00:50:52,599 --> 00:50:55,349
Pack your bags and leave by morning.

780
00:50:55,807 --> 00:50:56,432
Goodbye.

781
00:51:03,482 --> 00:51:05,440
Sister, wake up.

782
00:51:06,690 --> 00:51:09,232
We are going to the city for marriage shopping
Everyone is ready,

783
00:51:09,274 --> 00:51:11,524
You're late.
- Damn! I need to sleep.

784
00:51:11,607 --> 00:51:13,649
Brother-in-law was in your dreams?

785
00:51:13,899 --> 00:51:17,607
In my dreams? He must have escaped
with his bags by now.

786
00:51:17,857 --> 00:51:19,399
Come, let's check on him.

787
00:51:21,607 --> 00:51:23,565
Subbayya, black coffee.

788
00:51:23,649 --> 00:51:25,274
- Ok madam.
- I want white milk.

789
00:51:25,357 --> 00:51:28,815
Add some washing powder to it,
everything will come out white.

790
00:51:29,024 --> 00:51:31,149
Hey, aren't you ready yet?

791
00:51:31,315 --> 00:51:33,524
We are going for shopping
freshen up quickly.

792
00:51:33,607 --> 00:51:36,732
Why are we shopping for a marriage
that's never going to happen?

793
00:51:38,024 --> 00:51:39,982
Why does a useless fellow
need to drink milk?

794
00:51:40,690 --> 00:51:42,024
Hey! Hey! Hey!

795
00:51:42,565 --> 00:51:45,315
Cancelling a wedding isn't
as easy as cancelling milk.

796
00:51:45,399 --> 00:51:46,774
I'll leave only after seeing your wedding.

797
00:51:46,899 --> 00:51:48,649
First of all, where's the groom?

798
00:51:48,857 --> 00:51:50,565
Did he run away?

799
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:52,440
Put those bags in the car.
- Ok madam.

This saree?
- Which saree?

802
00:51:54,899 --> 00:51:56,940
You're awesome, brother-in-law ran away.

803
00:51:57,065 --> 00:51:58,607
This wedding is cancelled.

804

00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:04,732
Where won't leave this place.

806

Time is almost 9'o clock
we should be starting by now.

807
00:52:07,024 --> 00:52:08,690
Son, we are still getting ready.

808
00:52:08,857 --> 00:52:12,065
Just think, this is wedding shopping
and six of you.

809
00:52:12,190 --> 00:52:14,982
6 mutiiplied by 5, you need atleast 30 sarees.

810
00:52:15,315 --> 00:52:17,399
It takes at least fifteen minutes

811
00:52:17,482 --> 00:52:20,982
It will take 8 hours for our selection.
- And we need an hour break for lunch.

812
00:52:21,024 --> 00:52:23,482
Let's order food to the shopping mall
or we're going to waste an hour.

813
00:52:24,190 --> 00:52:26,524
In this one hour, we can review our sarees.

814
00:52:26,607 --> 00:52:28,024
And change the saree if we don't like it.

815
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:31,857
Or we could order customized designs
from their branches.

816
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:35,024
We can't compromise on our favorite sarees.

817

It's not some school or temple
that we finish work as soon as possible.

It's a clothing store.

Isn't it true?
- Yes, Yes.

820
00:52:41,399 --> 00:52:43,690
Then, let's start.
- Let's go.

821
00:52:44,190 --> 00:52:46,649
Very good.
- Sruthi, you're very lucky.

822
00:52:46,732 --> 00:52:49,649
I've never seen a lucky girl like you.

823
00:52:49,774 --> 00:52:51,982
Our husbands don't have so much patience.

824
00:52:52,024 --> 00:52:55,482
Is this some school or temple?
It's a clothing store, make it quick.

You didn't leave inspite of me
telling you so much?

828
00:53:07,815 --> 00:53:10,399
I thought of leaving...
I packed my bags too.

829
00:53:10,649 --> 00:53:12,857
My dad told me to leave immediately,

830
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:16,815
While I was putting my charger in the bag,
My mom spoke a few words.

831
00:53:18,565 --> 00:53:22,565
It's the matter of a girl life,
if you leave all of a sudden from wedding.

832

What will happen to her father's prestige?
Will she ever find an alliance?

833

What about her sister?
Will she get married?

834
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:32,274
She told me to think about your sister too.
- Yes, that's true.

835
00:53:32,482 --> 00:53:34,607
Isn't it?
That's the reason I stayed back.

836

Mom told everything will settle
once we have children,

837
00:53:37,732 --> 00:53:40,774
I was convinced and put the charger back.

They are Veerabhadram's goons,
they won't leave without killing us.

Tell me.

and son-in-law at one place.

You can start celebrating.

00:54:44,732 --> 00:54:46,232
Why do they want to kill us?

851

Veerabhadram's father did business with us

We split up because of some
misunderstandings.

including the son-in-law?

Once I shut down the system
and start my game.

You would be simply watching,
there will be nothing left for you to play.

Give him.

1103
01:19:25,680 --> 01:19:26,721
- You give him.
- No. you give him.

1104
01:19:26,763 --> 01:19:27,763
What’s the discussion?

1105
01:19:27,888 --> 01:19:30,638
We got orders from Delhi.
- Orders from Delhi?

1106
01:19:31,013 --> 01:19:31,555
What does it read?

1107
01:19:31,596 --> 01:19:33,763
You were granted leave
to succeed your love

1108
01:19:33,888 --> 01:19:35,346
Not to waste your time brother.

1109
01:19:35,471 --> 01:19:37,221
No. Listen to me...
- What's your problem?

1110
01:19:37,930 --> 01:19:40,096
Even hundreds of enemies
don’t scare you.

1111
01:19:40,263 --> 01:19:42,430
Why are you scared of Gita?

1112
01:19:43,013 --> 01:19:44,680
War is easier than love.

1113
01:19:44,805 --> 01:19:46,680
Brother, you have to propose her today

1114
01:19:46,888 --> 01:19:48,721
You have to get married on this trip.
- Shut up.

1115
01:19:48,930 --> 01:19:50,596
What now?
You want me to propose, right?

1116
01:19:50,930 --> 01:19:51,930
Ok, I'll do it.

1117
01:19:52,180 --> 01:19:53,846
Bro, wear these clothes.

1118
01:19:54,138 --> 01:19:56,430
- Spray this.
- Hide this.

1119
01:19:56,513 --> 01:19:58,013
Give this to her.

1120
01:20:04,471 --> 01:20:05,346
Brother.

1121
01:20:05,430 --> 01:20:07,263
Don’t return alone.
- Come as a couple, bro.

1122
01:20:10,430 --> 01:20:11,180
Excuse me.
- Yes?

1123
01:20:11,221 --> 01:20:13,513
I would like to meet Dr. Gita, Microbiologist…
- Who are you?

1124
01:20:13,555 --> 01:20:15,930
Tell her Akash is here to meet her urgently.
- Please wait.

1125
01:20:16,305 --> 01:20:17,013
Dust.

1126
01:20:21,430 --> 01:20:22,471
Excuse me.
- Yes?

1127
01:20:22,721 --> 01:20:25,346
I would like to meet Dr. Gita.
Tell her Sanjeev is here.

1128
01:20:25,430 --> 01:20:26,930
don’t mind to wait.

1129
01:20:27,180 --> 01:20:29,013
Please wait, sir. I will call you.
- Advocate?

1130
01:20:29,888 --> 01:20:30,805
Sorry.
- Sorry.

1131
01:20:31,180 --> 01:20:31,930
Sorry bro.

1132
01:20:32,180 --> 01:20:33,471
I'm Akash.
- Sanjeev.

1133
01:20:33,721 --> 01:20:34,763
Nice to meet you.

1134
01:20:35,263 --> 01:20:37,763
If you don’t mind,
choose amongst the fingers

1135
01:20:37,846 --> 01:20:39,346
Why?
- Do it bro.

1136
01:20:39,888 --> 01:20:40,930
Ok.
- Wow, yes.

1137
01:20:41,055 --> 01:20:41,888
My love is successful.

1138
01:20:42,180 --> 01:20:43,555
Love?
- Yes bro.

1139
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:45,221
Basically, I am from California.

1140
01:20:45,555 --> 01:20:46,971
Operation Manager at Microsoft.

1141
01:20:47,596 --> 01:20:49,680
Annual salary would be one million dollars.

1142
01:20:49,971 --> 01:20:51,930
Dollar is equal to 68 rupees now, bro.
- So great.

1143
01:20:52,138 --> 01:20:54,680
Anyways, I came to India a week before.

1144
01:20:54,930 --> 01:20:55,930
Six days back...

1145
01:20:56,305 --> 01:20:57,305
I saw a girl.

1146
01:20:57,596 --> 01:21:00,013
Five days back, I've decided
that she is my wife.

1147
01:21:00,221 --> 01:21:01,471
- Interesting.
- Since four days back

1148
01:21:01,555 --> 01:21:02,805
I am having continuous dreams

1149
01:21:03,388 --> 01:21:04,596
And three days back...

1150
01:21:05,180 --> 01:21:06,388
My hard disk crashed.

1151
01:21:07,180 --> 01:21:08,346
And two days back

1152
01:21:08,596 --> 01:21:11,013
I took my parents
and proposed to her

1153
01:21:11,846 --> 01:21:13,096
When I called her one day back,

1154
01:21:13,180 --> 01:21:15,346
I mean yesterday,
today she would take a decision.

1155
01:21:16,638 --> 01:21:17,805
It will be okay, right?

1156
01:21:18,055 --> 01:21:18,596
Bro.

1157
01:21:18,805 --> 01:21:20,846
That girl must be crazy to reject you.

1158
01:21:21,055 --> 01:21:23,513
Thank you, bro. You should definitely
attend my wedding. I insist…

1159
01:21:24,013 --> 01:21:24,846
I'll come for sure.

1160
01:21:24,971 --> 01:21:26,596
Sir, madam is calling you.
- Ok.

1161
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:28,180
Sir, she is calling you too.
- Ok.

1162
01:21:28,638 --> 01:21:29,305
Come bro.

1163
01:21:33,430 --> 01:21:34,305
Gita.

1164
01:21:36,805 --> 01:21:37,846
Gita.

1165
01:21:39,430 --> 01:21:40,430
- Gita.
- Gita.

1166
01:22:03,721 --> 01:22:04,263
Hi.

1167
01:22:04,388 --> 01:22:05,388
Hi Gita.
- How are you?

1168
01:22:05,430 --> 01:22:06,971
- I'm good.
- I like your shirt.

1169
01:22:07,138 --> 01:22:09,013
It’s not a shirt. It’s a jacket.
- Thanks bro.

1170
01:22:09,430 --> 01:22:10,180
Mom selected it.

1171
01:22:10,388 --> 01:22:12,805
- How is you mom?
- Waiting for your response.

1172
01:22:12,971 --> 01:22:14,055
Gita.

1173
01:22:15,138 --> 01:22:15,971
Sorry, Sanjeev…

1174
01:22:16,055 --> 01:22:18,846
I totally forgot you
in the joy of seeing Akash.

1175
01:22:19,596 --> 01:22:21,846
He is my best friend, Sanjeev.

1176
01:22:22,138 --> 01:22:23,096
Oh...

1177
01:22:23,638 --> 01:22:26,346
I don’t make any decision
without asking Sanjeev.

1178
01:22:27,013 --> 01:22:28,721
Thank god he came at the right time.

1179
01:22:28,930 --> 01:22:30,555
Sanjeev, he is Mr. Akash.

1180
01:22:30,721 --> 01:22:32,430
Though he knows that I don't have anyone.

1181
01:22:32,596 --> 01:22:35,138
He came along with his parents
and proposed for a marriage.

1182
01:22:35,263 --> 01:22:36,430
He is a gentleman, isn’t it?

1183
01:22:36,513 --> 01:22:37,138
Ya.

1184
01:22:37,846 --> 01:22:39,263
Very good… I am really happy.

1185
01:22:39,555 --> 01:22:40,096
See you.

1186
01:22:40,263 --> 01:22:43,055
Wait, Sanjeev… I feel strong
if you are with me right now.

1187
01:22:44,013 --> 01:22:47,805
The reason I asked
for two days time

1188
01:22:48,513 --> 01:22:51,263
Because I love a guy sincerely

1189
01:22:55,055 --> 01:22:56,096
No issues.

1190
01:22:56,638 --> 01:22:57,555
Quite common actually…

1191
01:22:57,888 --> 01:23:00,846
He didn’t love you back, right?
- That idiot didn’t even get it.

1192
01:23:01,096 --> 01:23:02,930
- Who’s that idiot?
- Why should I tell you?

1193
01:23:03,180 --> 01:23:05,555
Would you tell me
if you loved someone?

1194
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:07,138
I didn’t even tell the girl.
Why would I tell you?

1195
01:23:07,180 --> 01:23:08,096
Bro, one minute.

1196
01:23:08,388 --> 01:23:10,263
Bro, why are you fighting?
It’s quite common

1197
01:23:10,346 --> 01:23:11,846
Bro, I'm talking on your behalf.

1198
01:23:12,013 --> 01:23:12,971
Ok. Ok.

1199
01:23:13,638 --> 01:23:15,346
Whom do you guys love?
at least give me a clue.

1200
01:23:15,430 --> 01:23:17,096
My lovers height 6.2

1201
01:23:17,221 --> 01:23:18,138
He is very shy.

1202
01:23:18,930 --> 01:23:21,180
My lover has a big mouth,
she keeps talking.

1203
01:23:21,721 --> 01:23:22,971
Ok, ok, one minute.

1204
01:23:23,888 --> 01:23:25,513
The height you were talking about
it's not him right?

1205
01:23:25,555 --> 01:23:27,055
No, not him.
- Ok, super.

1206
01:23:27,221 --> 01:23:29,221
The girl you were talking about
is obviously not her

1207
01:23:29,305 --> 01:23:30,180
No chance.

1208
01:23:30,221 --> 01:23:32,346
Super… Quite interesting…
Continue…

1209
01:23:32,763 --> 01:23:33,263
Continue.

1210
01:23:33,305 --> 01:23:35,388
My lover likes Timex watch.

1211
01:23:37,846 --> 01:23:39,680
My lover really like white color.

1212
01:23:39,763 --> 01:23:41,013
Wait, wait,
one minute.

1213
01:23:41,221 --> 01:23:42,805
This isn’t the white dress
you' re talking about, right?

1214
01:23:44,430 --> 01:23:46,721
The Timex watch you were talking about
is obviously not his.

1215
01:23:46,805 --> 01:23:47,638
No, no.

1216
01:23:48,430 --> 01:23:48,971
Thank you.

1217
01:23:49,305 --> 01:23:50,971
I'm relaxed.
Continue… Continue…

1218
01:23:51,180 --> 01:23:53,263
Tell me his name
if your love is true

1219
01:23:53,305 --> 01:23:54,430
That’s the spirit.
Come on… Tell me.

1220
01:23:54,513 --> 01:23:55,680
His name is Sanjeev…

1221
01:23:55,846 --> 01:23:56,388
Sanjeev?

1222
01:23:56,471 --> 01:23:57,971
Girl’s name?
- Girl's name?

1223
01:23:59,013 --> 01:23:59,638
Gita.

1224
01:24:01,763 --> 01:24:04,305
I understood when you came here
with a bouquet.

1225
01:24:04,430 --> 01:24:07,013
It took you three years to say this.

1226
01:24:08,430 --> 01:24:09,638
Will you give it at least now?

1227
01:24:18,513 --> 01:24:19,346
Hey bro.

1228
01:24:20,388 --> 01:24:23,013
Where are you going?
- I understood clearly, bro.

1229
01:24:23,638 --> 01:24:24,846
I'm going to Hollywood.

1230
01:24:24,971 --> 01:24:27,930
And settle with a porn star
though it gets costly

1231
01:24:28,221 --> 01:24:29,930
You carry on.

1232
01:24:31,138 --> 01:24:32,721
You've wasted three years already.

1233
01:24:32,846 --> 01:24:34,638
I can’t even wait for another
three minutes.

1234
01:24:35,013 --> 01:24:38,055
Hold my hand and take me home
right now.

1235
01:24:43,888 --> 01:24:44,930
What must have happened?

1236
01:24:45,055 --> 01:24:46,680
What did she say, bro?
yes or no?

1237
01:24:47,638 --> 01:24:49,096
Oh, she rejected.

1238
01:24:56,055 --> 01:24:57,096
Yes.

1239
01:25:03,930 --> 01:25:05,763
Mother, bless me.

1240
01:25:05,805 --> 01:25:07,721
Who are you dear?
- My name is Gita.

1241
01:25:07,805 --> 01:25:10,596
Sanjeev and I have been in love
since three years.

1242
01:25:11,430 --> 01:25:14,138
You adore Sai Baba.
You are crazy about your family.

1243
01:25:14,930 --> 01:25:17,013
You drink coffee four times in a day.

1244
01:25:17,096 --> 01:25:19,971
You really love the show
‘Meelo Evaru Koteeswarudu’.

1245
01:25:20,805 --> 01:25:24,096
You never get angry
but are extremely sensitive.

1246
01:25:24,388 --> 01:25:25,680
But one thing is true.

1247
01:25:25,763 --> 01:25:29,013
Accept me and I will look after you
like a mother.

1248
01:25:32,305 --> 01:25:33,638
She is the ideal girl.

1249
01:25:33,971 --> 01:25:35,805
You found the perfect daughter-in-law

1250
01:25:36,305 --> 01:25:37,346
- Greetings, uncle.
- Greetings.

1251
01:25:37,430 --> 01:25:40,055
Sanju, I really like this girl.

1252
01:25:40,305 --> 01:25:42,138
Come in, dear.
- Come in.

1253
01:25:51,638 --> 01:25:52,805
Surprise.

1254
01:25:55,805 --> 01:25:58,638
Gita bought me new glasses.
How are they?

1255
01:25:59,596 --> 01:26:00,805
They are good.

1256
01:26:01,971 --> 01:26:03,888
You said you will look after me
like my daughter

1257
01:26:04,138 --> 01:26:06,013
But she would take care of me
like her mom.

1258
01:26:10,013 --> 01:26:11,971
Examination results are in February.

1259
01:26:12,055 --> 01:26:14,971
Jawaharlal Nehru Technological Institute
of Hyderabad

1260
01:26:15,096 --> 01:26:18,263
B. Tech Aeronautical Engineering…
Topper of the university…

1261
01:26:18,513 --> 01:26:19,388
Ajay.

1262
01:26:20,013 --> 01:26:20,971
Superb bro.

1263
01:26:21,430 --> 01:26:22,971
Superb bro.
- Thanks brother.

1264
01:26:23,138 --> 01:26:24,305
I knew you will achieve it.

1265
01:26:24,471 --> 01:26:25,430
Bro... what about the bike?

1266
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:27,680
I will buy it right now. Come on.
- Does he really need a bike?

1267
01:26:27,846 --> 01:26:29,763
Dad, he studied better
than we expected.

1268
01:26:29,805 --> 01:26:31,888
When else would he enjoy riding?
Come with me.

1269
01:26:32,935 --> 01:26:34,352
Please select your model.

1270
01:26:35,102 --> 01:26:37,227
I want a pulsar in red color. 220 CC.

1271
01:26:37,393 --> 01:26:40,102
Four stroke… DTS oil cool engine…
With alloy wheels

1272
01:26:40,185 --> 01:26:41,810
Registration number 1510.

1273
01:26:42,060 --> 01:26:43,060
Why 1510?

1274
01:26:43,227 --> 01:26:44,893
It’s Abdul Kalam’s birthday date.

1275
01:26:44,977 --> 01:26:45,852
Ok.

1276
01:26:45,935 --> 01:26:50,310
Sir, a guy just got a bike
with the same specifications delivered.

1277
01:26:50,435 --> 01:26:51,393
It’s over there. check it out.

1278
01:26:54,310 --> 01:26:55,310
Surprise.

1279
01:26:55,602 --> 01:26:56,435
Why did you buy it?

1280
01:26:56,602 --> 01:26:58,435
Why shouldn’t I buy for Ajay?

1281
01:26:58,518 --> 01:26:59,935
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1282
01:26:59,977 --> 01:27:01,185
Thank you.
- Drive safe.

1283
01:27:03,810 --> 01:27:04,602
Thanks.

1284
01:27:04,768 --> 01:27:06,310
I don’t need thanks.

1285
01:27:06,768 --> 01:27:07,810
This is enough.

1286
01:27:26,977 --> 01:27:31,602
"The moment eyes meet…
The moment lips meet…"

1287
01:27:31,893 --> 01:27:36,143
"This moment with you is forever"

1288
01:27:36,727 --> 01:27:41,393
"The moment eyes blink…
The moment sweet tears are shed"

1289
01:27:41,643 --> 01:27:46,185
"This moment with you is forever"

1290
01:27:46,518 --> 01:27:50,602
"This moment is to be visited
again and again"

1291
01:27:51,477 --> 01:27:55,143
"Every moment is to be
cherished with you"

1292
01:27:56,477 --> 01:28:01,227
"Do you know it, my heart?
The moment we take a step together"

1293
01:28:01,310 --> 01:28:05,977
"Do you know it, my heart?
Every second passes like a century"

1294
01:28:06,185 --> 01:28:10,977
"Do you know it, my heart?
Every moment that I am with you"

1295
01:28:11,102 --> 01:28:15,560
"Do you know it, my heart?
The world is at my feet"

1296
01:28:40,268 --> 01:28:44,810
"Any minute spent with you"

1297
01:28:45,060 --> 01:28:50,102
"Every moment is a sweet memory"

1298
01:28:50,227 --> 01:28:59,477
"Tears tend to be pleasant,
As your presence becomes my temple"

1299
01:28:59,768 --> 01:29:04,518
"There is anxiety as
I read our names together"

1300
01:29:04,643 --> 01:29:09,477
"Every second unites
to make it our time"

1301
01:29:09,852 --> 01:29:18,727
"To the body diverted by youth,
These moments are mesmerizing"

1302
01:29:19,685 --> 01:29:24,518
"Do you know it, my heart?
The moment we take a step together"

1303
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:29,143
"Do you know it, my heart?
Every second passes like a century"

1304
01:29:29,393 --> 01:29:34,227
"Do you know it, my heart?
Every moment that I am with you"

1305
01:29:34,352 --> 01:29:39,102
"Do you know it, my heart?
The world is at my feet"

1306
01:30:08,435 --> 01:30:13,018
"Before this sweet moment turns sour"

1307
01:30:13,227 --> 01:30:18,227
"I will save you with all my life"

1308
01:30:18,393 --> 01:30:22,935
"Before this magical moment disappear"

1309
01:30:23,060 --> 01:30:27,810
"Shall I hide you in my heart forever?"

1310
01:30:27,935 --> 01:30:32,768
"Are these seconds or sweet poems?
Are these seconds or centuries of love?"

1311
01:30:32,852 --> 01:30:37,727
"I wait in this bewilderment for you"

1312
01:30:38,018 --> 01:30:42,227
"I can’t manage to catch my breath"

1313
01:30:42,310 --> 01:30:47,310
"I can never get enough of this high"

1314
01:30:47,852 --> 01:30:52,685
"Do you know it, my heart?
The moment we take a step together"

1315
01:30:52,727 --> 01:30:57,310
"Do you know it, my heart?
Every second passes like a century"

1316
01:30:57,560 --> 01:31:02,393
"Do you know it, my heart?
Every moment that I am with you"

1317
01:31:02,518 --> 01:31:07,268
"Do you know it, my heart?
The world is at my feet"

1318
01:31:28,018 --> 01:31:29,685
Hey Ajay… Come fast.

1319
01:31:30,018 --> 01:31:31,602
We have many invitations to distribute.

1320
01:31:32,018 --> 01:31:33,685
Why are you still coughing?

1321
01:31:33,893 --> 01:31:35,018
Didn’t you recover yet?

1322
01:31:36,143 --> 01:31:37,477
Let’s go to the hospital.

1323
01:31:38,852 --> 01:31:39,518
Ajay...

1324
01:31:39,643 --> 01:31:41,560
What happened?
Hey. Hey.

1325
01:31:42,018 --> 01:31:43,227
- What happened?
- Look at him.

1326
01:31:43,435 --> 01:31:45,018
Ajay, what happened dear?

1327
01:31:45,393 --> 01:31:46,685
Oh no. Blood.

1328
01:31:46,768 --> 01:31:47,560
Sanju.

1329
01:31:47,727 --> 01:31:49,310
Sanju, come fast.
- What happened?

1330
01:31:49,435 --> 01:31:50,727
What happened?
- Look what’s wrong with him.

1331
01:31:50,810 --> 01:31:52,560
What happened, Ajay?

1332
01:31:52,602 --> 01:31:53,185
Ajay.

1333
01:31:53,768 --> 01:31:55,352
Ajay.
- He is sacring me.

1334
01:31:55,477 --> 01:31:56,477
Ajay.

1335
01:32:07,643 --> 01:32:09,143
Why so many tests for cough, doctor?

1336
01:32:10,852 --> 01:32:12,602
He is not even getting
enough sleep recently.

1337
01:32:13,060 --> 01:32:14,518
It must be body heat.

1338
01:32:14,602 --> 01:32:15,727
Sir… Reports.

1339
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:17,810
Look at this report.

1340
01:32:18,643 --> 01:32:20,643
Bronchogenic Carcinoma.

1341
01:32:21,143 --> 01:32:21,893
What does it mean?

1342
01:32:22,060 --> 01:32:22,977
Lung cancer.

1343
01:32:25,227 --> 01:32:27,227
Don't we have a treatment doctor?

1344
01:32:27,977 --> 01:32:29,602
It’s in an advanced stage.

1345
01:32:30,393 --> 01:32:32,560
It’s already late.

1346
01:32:32,935 --> 01:32:35,102
It has spread to the brain and liver.

1347
01:32:35,602 --> 01:32:38,685
As he was young,
symptoms didn’t appear until now.

1348
01:32:39,060 --> 01:32:41,810
As far as I know,
we can’t help him in anyway

1349
01:32:42,143 --> 01:32:43,352
I'm so sorry.

1350
01:33:08,268 --> 01:33:09,643
Since when are you used to this?

1351
01:33:09,852 --> 01:33:11,268
This is the reason behind it.

1352
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:13,560
Quit it. Quit it right away.

1353
01:33:16,518 --> 01:33:17,560
Hey Ajay...

1354
01:33:17,935 --> 01:33:20,227
Sorry bother...

1355
01:33:21,727 --> 01:33:23,393
Sorry I hit you in pain.

1356
01:33:23,685 --> 01:33:24,643
Sorry.

1357
01:33:25,768 --> 01:33:26,810
Please quit it.

1358
01:33:27,477 --> 01:33:29,143
I am unable to quit

1359
01:33:29,935 --> 01:33:32,560
I am telling you as a brother.
Quit it.

1360
01:33:32,977 --> 01:33:34,393
Everything will be back to normal.

1361
01:33:34,852 --> 01:33:37,810
I'll die in a month
How will I ever be normal?

1362
01:33:38,602 --> 01:33:40,060
I cheated everyone.

1363
01:33:40,352 --> 01:33:41,268
You.

1364
01:33:41,810 --> 01:33:42,727
Mom.

1365
01:33:43,227 --> 01:33:44,060
Dad.

1366
01:33:45,185 --> 01:33:46,477
Abdul Kalam.

1367
01:33:48,268 --> 01:33:52,060
I dreamt to serve the country
and earn good name.

1368
01:33:52,893 --> 01:33:54,268
You can do everything.

1369
01:33:59,435 --> 01:34:02,227
This shattered all my dreams, bro.

1370
01:34:07,185 --> 01:34:08,893
Please don’t say that.

1371
01:34:09,810 --> 01:34:11,018
I'm here for you.

1372
01:34:12,393 --> 01:34:13,935
That's my strength brother.

1373
01:34:15,685 --> 01:34:17,768
You can take good care
of mom and dad.

1374
01:34:18,727 --> 01:34:20,935
I can’t show my face to anyone now.

1375
01:34:21,518 --> 01:34:22,477
Sorry brother.

1376
01:34:22,685 --> 01:34:23,893
Please forgive me.

1377
01:34:27,310 --> 01:34:28,102
Ajay.

1378
01:34:29,893 --> 01:34:30,852
Ajay.

1379
01:34:32,185 --> 01:34:32,852
Ajay.

1380
01:34:33,727 --> 01:34:34,352
Ajay.

1381
01:34:34,893 --> 01:34:35,435
Ajay.

1382
01:34:36,685 --> 01:34:38,018
Ajay get up.
Ajay.

1383
01:34:38,352 --> 01:34:39,810
Ajay get up.

1384
01:34:41,185 --> 01:34:42,227
Ajay.

1385
01:34:44,185 --> 01:34:46,560
You had a lot of dreams.

1386
01:34:46,893 --> 01:34:49,935
I didn’t expect to see you like this.

1387
01:34:51,935 --> 01:34:55,768
Gita, ask him to look at me once.

1388
01:35:14,102 --> 01:35:14,935
Sanjeev.

1389
01:35:15,102 --> 01:35:15,977
Gita.

1390
01:35:16,852 --> 01:35:18,643
Have you seen Ajay’s
post mortem reports?

1391
01:35:20,727 --> 01:35:22,602
We thought only the lungs
were damaged.

1392
01:35:22,810 --> 01:35:24,393
Even the brain and liver were affected.

1393
01:35:24,685 --> 01:35:26,102
It’s called distance spread.

1394
01:35:27,102 --> 01:35:30,727
Only the people with this habit
for over 20 years get affected.

1395
01:35:31,352 --> 01:35:33,227
But Ajay is 20 years old.

1396
01:35:33,518 --> 01:35:36,768
He must be into some other drugs.

1397
01:36:33,727 --> 01:36:35,768
Everyone in our gang is used
to this tiger brand.

1398
01:36:36,060 --> 01:36:37,352
We are smoking since a year, bro.

1399
01:36:37,852 --> 01:36:41,268
We started smoking it to boost
our concentration during exams

1400
01:36:41,352 --> 01:36:43,060
Now we are addicted to it.

1401
01:36:43,727 --> 01:36:45,393
We have to test you immediately.

1402
01:36:54,435 --> 01:36:55,393
Sanjeev.

1403
01:37:00,643 --> 01:37:03,518
Even these two will have to face
the consequences like Ajay

1404
01:37:09,810 --> 01:37:10,727
Test these smokes too.

1405
01:37:10,935 --> 01:37:11,602
Ok.

1406
01:37:52,102 --> 01:37:53,727
Sanjeev, come with me.

1407
01:37:57,435 --> 01:37:58,477
Why have we come here?

1408
01:37:58,768 --> 01:38:00,810
There is a lot more
we need to know.

1409
01:38:01,435 --> 01:38:02,310
Hello Gita.

1410
01:38:02,602 --> 01:38:05,268
They are from the Anti Tobacco organization
you wanted to meet

1411
01:38:05,935 --> 01:38:07,852
Sir, please go through this report.

1412
01:38:10,935 --> 01:38:11,685
Very good.

1413
01:38:12,143 --> 01:38:15,602
This report exposes
how dangerous Tiger brand is.

1414
01:38:16,018 --> 01:38:17,268
Come with me once.

1415
01:38:21,393 --> 01:38:23,977
They are all people subjected to cancer
due to contaminated cigarettes

1416
01:38:24,185 --> 01:38:25,893
And other forms of tobacco.

1417
01:38:26,477 --> 01:38:29,893
It’s all a dark business. These brands
don’t have Government approval

1418
01:38:30,435 --> 01:38:34,018
Many organizations like us
are fighting against this in India

1419
01:38:34,477 --> 01:38:37,518
It's increasing day by day
but not reducing.

1420
01:38:44,268 --> 01:38:46,518

"I will show you
what I am made of"

1897
02:09:17,560 --> 02:09:21,227
"You are hot and kind at the same time"

1898
02:09:21,310 --> 02:09:24,894
"I want you to go wild over me"

1899
02:09:24,977 --> 02:09:28,602
"You are a fighter. Keep going for it"

1900
02:09:28,685 --> 02:09:32,102
"You have to spread
your kindness to all"

1901
02:09:32,352 --> 02:09:35,935
"The skies are frightened
by the thunder"

1902
02:09:36,060 --> 02:09:39,602
"As your speed comes on attack,
current catches shock"

1903
02:09:40,019 --> 02:09:43,644
"As you spray some perfume
and put dhoti on"

1904
02:09:43,727 --> 02:09:46,560
"The entire place goes crazy
while you walk"

1905
02:09:47,102 --> 02:09:51,019
"Deceiving my mascara eyes
with your mischief"

1906
02:09:51,144 --> 02:09:53,894
"Your risk factor is amazing"

1907
02:09:54,477 --> 02:09:59,769
"It’s amazing when
you show your collar off"

1908
02:10:00,060 --> 02:10:01,727
"Your style is amazing"

1909
02:10:01,935 --> 02:10:05,810
"It’s amazing to watch your courage"

1910
02:10:05,935 --> 02:10:09,310
"My heart’s been shaken"

1911
02:10:28,144 --> 02:10:31,935
You got lucky, Savitri. The container
ended up in your hands

1912
02:10:38,810 --> 02:10:40,477
Get down… Get down I say

1913
02:10:41,644 --> 02:10:42,935
I'm getting down.

1914
02:10:42,977 --> 02:10:44,227
Brother-in-law…
- Savitri.

1915
02:10:44,269 --> 02:10:45,394
I am coming to you.

1916
02:10:45,435 --> 02:10:48,060
I got our money from him.
- Our money?

1917
02:10:48,269 --> 02:10:50,269
Isn’t my brother-in-law’s money my money?
What do you say?

1918
02:10:50,352 --> 02:10:53,560
Savitri, you are really superb.
- I'm always superb.

1919
02:10:53,602 --> 02:10:55,852
Just hand shake or do I get
a share too? - Share?

1920
02:10:56,852 --> 02:10:59,019
I brought every single penny of it carefully.

1921
02:10:59,144 --> 02:11:00,977
My brother-in-law promised
to make an action film with me.

1922
02:11:01,144 --> 02:11:02,769
What do you say, brother?
Won’t you give me my share?

1923
02:11:02,935 --> 02:11:05,144
Your share, right? I will give it.

1924
02:11:05,269 --> 02:11:07,435
Brother-in-law, Ask him to fall at my feet
and apologize first

1925
02:11:07,519 --> 02:11:08,602
Sorry? Me?

1926
02:11:08,644 --> 02:11:11,310
Fatso! He said some really bad things
on the phone to me

1927
02:11:12,185 --> 02:11:13,144
Apologize.

1928
02:11:13,560 --> 02:11:15,352
Sorry.
- Ok.

1929
02:11:15,519 --> 02:11:17,227
Go and open the door.

1930
02:11:21,185 --> 02:11:22,310
Where’s the money?

1931
02:11:23,894 --> 02:11:25,435
Brother-in-law...

1932
02:11:25,560 --> 02:11:27,769
Bro, you wait. Come here.

1933
02:11:27,852 --> 02:11:29,519
Why? My God!

1934
02:11:31,852 --> 02:11:33,144
Bro, this looks like a remote.

1935
02:11:33,185 --> 02:11:36,144
Don’t press it. The bomb in my stomach
will blast

1936
02:11:36,227 --> 02:11:37,519
Bomb?
- Hey... hey...

1937
02:11:37,602 --> 02:11:39,394
Why would I put a time bomb
in your mouth, idiot?

1938
02:11:39,519 --> 02:11:40,560
It’s a motion tablet.

1939
02:11:41,685 --> 02:11:44,102
Motion tablet? So, isn’t any bomb
in my stomach?

1940
02:11:44,185 --> 02:11:45,935
My money is also not here.
- Brother-in-law.

1941
02:11:46,352 --> 02:11:47,394
He did it all.

1942
02:11:47,685 --> 02:11:49,394
I was right by him and
he didn’t give me a single penny.

1943
02:11:49,519 --> 02:11:51,644
Looks like he distributed
the money already

1944
02:11:51,727 --> 02:11:54,019
Where are the 50 billion rupees?

1945
02:11:54,935 --> 02:11:56,019
Ticket... ticket...

1946
02:11:56,352 --> 02:11:58,477
Bro, 5K was deposited in my account.

1947
02:11:58,602 --> 02:12:01,060
I don’t know who did it.
- It must be a fake message.

1948
02:12:02,644 --> 02:12:05,185
Even I got 5K transferred
through PayPal

1949
02:12:05,477 --> 02:12:08,769
I got 5K from Western Union. Super!

1950
02:12:08,935 --> 02:12:11,060
Someone deposited 5K on Money gram.

1951
02:12:11,185 --> 02:12:13,810
It isn’t unusual of Kohli to hit a six.

1952
02:12:14,185 --> 02:12:18,227
But someone transferring money is new.

1953
02:12:18,560 --> 02:12:22,144
Son, have a look at this message.
I don’t get it.

1954
02:12:22,435 --> 02:12:24,060
Someone deposited 5K in your account.

1955
02:12:36,144 --> 02:12:37,685
My house owner warned
to throw my stuff out.

1956
02:12:37,727 --> 02:12:39,102
I will throw this money on his face.

1957
02:12:39,310 --> 02:12:40,644
My dad doesn’t even give me
pocket money.

1958
02:12:40,685 --> 02:12:42,560
But some stranger deposited 5K for me.

1959
02:12:51,602 --> 02:12:55,102
It is yet unknown who deposited
the money and why.

1960
02:12:55,227 --> 02:12:57,185
To enquire about the money transfer,

1961
02:12:57,227 --> 02:13:00,019
Enforcement Department has handed over
the case to CBI

1962
02:13:03,102 --> 02:13:04,935
Sir, Enforcement has handed over
the case to you.

1963
02:13:05,019 --> 02:13:06,477
How are you going to deal it?

1964
02:13:06,519 --> 02:13:08,519
Will you catch the money
depositors or not?

1965
02:13:09,310 --> 02:13:10,477
We will catch them.

1966
02:13:10,602 --> 02:13:12,769
We will find out who deposited
the money and why

1967
02:13:12,894 --> 02:13:15,477
If it's illegal money or anything...

1968
02:13:15,852 --> 02:13:17,227
We'll find it out in two hours.

1969
02:13:17,685 --> 02:13:18,477
Two hours.

1970
02:13:18,852 --> 02:13:20,477
Have they gone crazy?

1971
02:13:20,602 --> 02:13:22,602
Instead of catching the ones
robbing money,

1972
02:13:22,727 --> 02:13:24,935
They are after people distributing money

1973
02:13:25,102 --> 02:13:27,269
They can't find them.

1974
02:13:27,310 --> 02:13:27,935
Hello.

1975
02:13:28,685 --> 02:13:29,435
Tell me, Suresh.

1976
02:13:30,102 --> 02:13:30,769
Hello sir.

1977
02:13:31,102 --> 02:13:32,144
Sir. Like you said,

1978
02:13:32,519 --> 02:13:35,727
They have a warehouse in a private compound
behind the chemical factory.

1979
02:13:35,852 --> 02:13:37,185
No one is allowed there.

1980
02:13:37,602 --> 02:13:39,977
If you go, you might find
the formula.

1981
02:13:40,102 --> 02:13:42,310
Find out what’s happening inside.
But be careful.

1982
02:13:42,477 --> 02:13:43,102
Ok?

1983
02:13:43,227 --> 02:13:43,769
Ok sir.

1984
02:13:44,060 --> 02:13:44,769
Attention.

1985
02:13:45,060 --> 02:13:46,602
Attention everybody.
- Good morning sir.

1986
02:13:47,227 --> 02:13:49,269
We got a call from Home Security.

1987
02:13:49,685 --> 02:13:53,685
5 million people all over India
were distributed 50 billion.

1988
02:13:53,769 --> 02:13:55,769
It has all been operated from our State.

1989
02:13:55,977 --> 02:13:58,019
How could they deposit money
to so many people?

1990
02:13:58,102 --> 02:13:59,060
Sasidhar.
- Sir.

1991
02:13:59,185 --> 02:14:01,519
I immediately need all the details.
- Ok sir.

1992
02:14:01,727 --> 02:14:04,227
The way we gather data
for marketing purposes

1993
02:14:04,269 --> 02:14:05,685
They must have done it in that way

1994
02:14:06,060 --> 02:14:09,727
How could they do it
without any ID proof?

1995
02:14:10,060 --> 02:14:13,019
They must have done it through
someone’s account.

1996
02:14:13,144 --> 02:14:14,894
Come on… Check it.
- Yes sir.

1997
02:14:16,560 --> 02:14:19,352
2000 IDs have been used totally, sir.
- 2000 people?

1998
02:14:19,602 --> 02:14:22,227
Catch everyone. Don’t spare anyone.

1999
02:14:22,477 --> 02:14:23,477
Show me your ID.

2000
02:14:24,935 --> 02:14:25,685
Is it original?

2001
02:14:25,894 --> 02:14:27,935
If you get any information,
tell me immediately.

2002
02:14:28,227 --> 02:14:29,477
Sir, we can’t catch
a single one of them

2003
02:14:29,560 --> 02:14:31,352
Why is that?
- All of them are dead.

2004
02:14:31,644 --> 02:14:32,394
How?

2005
02:14:32,685 --> 02:14:33,935
Due to cancer.

2006
02:14:34,185 --> 02:14:35,519
Ok.

2007
02:14:35,894 --> 02:14:39,644
This transfer was made using
the dead people’s IDs

2008
02:14:40,394 --> 02:14:41,727
But how is that possible?

2009
02:14:42,602 --> 02:14:43,560
Move.

2010
02:14:44,019 --> 02:14:46,394
Sir, he gave the voter list copy
of everyone in the city

2011
02:14:47,060 --> 02:14:49,435
Sir, I would have done it for 1000 bucks.
They paid me 500k

2012
02:14:49,519 --> 02:14:50,102
Who?

2013
02:14:50,227 --> 02:14:51,269
I don’t know him, sir.

2014
02:14:51,352 --> 02:14:53,727
He called and deposited 500K
in my account and I mailed him the list

2015
02:14:53,852 --> 02:14:55,352
Which number did he call from?

2016
02:14:55,894 --> 02:14:56,935
This number sir.

2017
02:14:59,727 --> 02:15:00,935
Satellite phone.

2018
02:15:01,102 --> 02:15:01,935
Sashi.
- Sir?

2019
02:15:02,019 --> 02:15:03,894
- Go through it.
- Ok sir.

2020
02:15:08,519 --> 02:15:10,852
It’s hard, sir. This satellite number
is in the army network

2021
02:15:11,727 --> 02:15:12,685
Army?

2022
02:15:13,269 --> 02:15:14,477
Sashi.
- Sir.

2023
02:15:14,894 --> 02:15:16,477
Talk to the defense secretary

2024
02:15:16,602 --> 02:15:18,644
Take the permission immediately.
- Ok sir.

2025
02:15:18,810 --> 02:15:19,519
Thank you.

2026
02:15:19,602 --> 02:15:21,144
Sir, Permission granted.

2027
02:15:22,977 --> 02:15:25,352
Sir, it shows the Rajahmundry area.

2028
02:15:34,019 --> 02:15:36,269
Book flight tickets to Rajahmundry.
- Sir.

2029
02:15:36,352 --> 02:15:38,227
Alert the local team.

2030
02:15:38,477 --> 02:15:41,310
Keep that phone under
continuous monitoring.

2031
02:15:42,019 --> 02:15:44,894
I will catch him today. Move.

2032
02:15:49,769 --> 02:15:51,727
Sir, the location is shown at Devi Mall.

2033
02:15:54,560 --> 02:15:55,977
Suresh, found anything?

2034
02:15:56,102 --> 02:15:59,310
Sir, I came to repair the server
in that private compound.

2035
02:15:59,394 --> 02:16:00,394
Your doubt was correct, sir.

2036
02:16:00,560 --> 02:16:02,935
Computerized illegal cigarette production
is happening here.

2037
02:16:04,852 --> 02:16:06,019
Through a main server

2038
02:16:06,144 --> 02:16:09,894
Cigarette filling, packing and production
is automatically taking place

2039
02:16:11,227 --> 02:16:13,269
The whole system has to be crashed
to stop the production

2040
02:16:13,352 --> 02:16:14,060
Yes sir.

2041
02:16:14,185 --> 02:16:16,560
But the firewall protection
is really strong here.

2042
02:16:16,810 --> 02:16:18,685
Overriding is not possible, sir.

2043
02:16:18,935 --> 02:16:21,060
Share me your location.
I am coming right away.

2044
02:16:21,185 --> 02:16:21,935
Ok sir.

2045
02:16:27,144 --> 02:16:29,727
It shows 100 meters.
- Hello, sir. Come on…

2046
02:16:31,102 --> 02:16:32,685
Sanju... cops are here.

2047
02:16:38,727 --> 02:16:40,477
Sir, even the satellite signal is cut.

2048
02:16:40,560 --> 02:16:41,810
Shit. He is smart.

2049
02:16:42,144 --> 02:16:45,019
He is somewhere around.
Round up every corner.

2050
02:16:45,185 --> 02:16:46,435
No one should go out.

2051
02:16:46,477 --> 02:16:48,102
Come on. Move...
- Move.

2052
02:16:52,144 --> 02:16:52,685
What?

2053
02:16:53,185 --> 02:16:54,394
Cops are in the mall.

2054
02:16:54,644 --> 02:16:56,144
What to do now?

2055
02:16:59,602 --> 02:17:01,435
Sir, your phone is ringing.

2056
02:17:06,644 --> 02:17:07,310
Hello.

2057
02:17:08,227 --> 02:17:10,352
Welcome to Rajahmundry.
- Who is this?

2058
02:17:10,810 --> 02:17:11,769
Who are you?

2059
02:17:12,185 --> 02:17:13,560
The common man you are looking for.

2060
02:17:13,685 --> 02:17:17,477
I know you are not a common man
but an army man.

2061
02:17:18,102 --> 02:17:20,977
To destroy Indian economy.

2062
02:17:21,644 --> 02:17:24,560
I also know you joined hands with
foreign countries and distributed the money

2063
02:17:24,810 --> 02:17:26,935
How much is your commission in that?

2064
02:17:27,019 --> 02:17:28,144
Tell me...

2065
02:17:28,227 --> 02:17:30,935
43.5k given by government on India.

2066
02:17:31,144 --> 02:17:33,769
Not to destroy the nation
but to protect it.

2067
02:17:34,602 --> 02:17:37,269
Why don’t you tell us
if it’s such a good act?

2068
02:17:37,560 --> 02:17:39,435
Sorry, sir. Military secret.

2069
02:17:39,560 --> 02:17:41,185
You know it can’t be leaked.

2070
02:17:41,310 --> 02:17:44,310
Whatever it is, I will catch you.

2071
02:17:44,435 --> 02:17:45,644
Whom will you catch, sir?

2072
02:17:45,769 --> 02:17:48,644
The one passing by in the red shirt?

2073
02:17:49,185 --> 02:17:50,060
Catch him.

2074
02:17:50,102 --> 02:17:51,144
What happened, sir?

2075
02:17:51,269 --> 02:17:53,644
Or the self executive walking
out of the shop?

2076
02:17:55,102 --> 02:17:57,935
Your brain speed and training isn’t sufficient
to catch me.

2077
02:17:58,810 --> 02:18:00,644
I will only surrender in 4 hours.

2078
02:18:00,810 --> 02:18:02,310
Stop. stop.

2079
02:18:02,519 --> 02:18:06,227
If you don’t surrender right away,
I would have to use my weapons.

2080
02:18:06,352 --> 02:18:07,352
Understand?

2081
02:18:07,852 --> 02:18:09,685
What, sir? Encounter?

2082
02:18:10,269 --> 02:18:13,060
Will you use the guns
we use back on us?

2083
02:18:13,435 --> 02:18:15,269
You need permission to shoot.

2084
02:18:15,685 --> 02:18:18,310
I don’t even need it.

2085
02:18:19,685 --> 02:18:22,685
I'm challenging you to get out of this mall.

2086
02:18:22,935 --> 02:18:26,685
I have left that place long back.
See you soon.

2087
02:18:31,769 --> 02:18:33,727
He is playing with us.

2088
02:18:34,310 --> 02:18:36,185
What the hell is going on here?
- Excuse me.

2089
02:19:04,644 --> 02:19:06,477
You said the formula would come running
if we take the money

2090
02:19:06,560 --> 02:19:08,894
Looks like we will be caught
before we find the formula.

2091
02:19:15,977 --> 02:19:17,810
Now we know the location of formula.

2092
02:19:18,519 --> 02:19:19,977
Send the second message.

2093
02:19:24,560 --> 02:19:25,769
'India in youth’s hands...'

2094
02:19:26,227 --> 02:19:28,769
'To know why I sent you the money,'

2095
02:19:29,019 --> 02:19:31,394
'Open this video link at 10  in the night.'

2096
02:19:31,685 --> 02:19:33,185
He sent money to all of us.

2097
02:19:33,227 --> 02:19:35,019
Get a big screen for the entire
hostel to watch

2098
02:19:35,185 --> 02:19:36,519
India in youth’s hands…

2099
02:19:36,644 --> 02:19:38,352
What’s this video going to be?

2100
02:19:38,477 --> 02:19:40,519
Everyone is discussing the same.

2101
02:19:40,602 --> 02:19:43,602
Is that video going to shake India?

2102
02:19:43,644 --> 02:19:45,977
What do you say, sir?
- Nothing, dear.

2103
02:19:46,185 --> 02:19:48,102
It’s a publicity stunt for money.

2104
02:19:48,435 --> 02:19:50,602
It must be some dirty video.
- No.

2105
02:19:50,769 --> 02:19:53,685
He is definitely trying to send a message
to the youth

2106
02:19:53,810 --> 02:19:55,935
Recharge for Internet on this phone.

2107
02:19:55,977 --> 02:19:59,060
Why do you need internet on phone?
- I want to see the person who sent me money.

2108
02:19:59,102 --> 02:20:01,477
It’s not possible on your phone.
I will show in mine. - Ok.

2109
02:20:01,519 --> 02:20:03,685
Excuse me, sir.
Phone from Home Secratray.

2110
02:20:06,727 --> 02:20:07,352
Tell me sir.

2111
02:20:07,435 --> 02:20:09,310
He sent a video link in another message.

2112
02:20:09,394 --> 02:20:11,227
We have to stop that
at any cost.

2113
02:20:11,310 --> 02:20:12,310
It’s hard, sir.

2114
02:20:12,519 --> 02:20:15,519
We can’t remove it unless
the link is activated

2115
02:20:15,602 --> 02:20:18,227
What if his message translates
before we stop it?

2116
02:20:18,394 --> 02:20:19,602
We can’t do anything, sir.

2117
02:20:19,977 --> 02:20:21,310
It will reach the public.

2118
02:20:21,394 --> 02:20:23,894
So, you want me to watch
the video too?

2119
02:20:24,560 --> 02:20:25,435
You have to, sir.

2120
02:20:33,394 --> 02:20:34,185
Sruthi.

2121
02:20:34,852 --> 02:20:36,185
Will you help me?

2122
02:20:36,477 --> 02:20:37,269
What is it?

2123
02:20:38,310 --> 02:20:42,727
I will transmit live video
through this at 10pm.

2124
02:20:43,310 --> 02:20:44,894
You should upload the link.

2125
02:20:45,352 --> 02:20:48,310
No matter what happens inside,
the video shouldn’t stop.

2126
02:20:48,810 --> 02:20:50,394
It must reach the public.

2127
02:20:50,810 --> 02:20:52,185
Will you do that for me?

2128
02:20:52,477 --> 02:20:53,352
Promise me.

2129
02:20:58,644 --> 02:20:59,394
Thank you.

2130
02:20:59,935 --> 02:21:00,727
Sanjeev.

2131
02:21:00,977 --> 02:21:03,144
I was string when you
were beside me

2132
02:21:03,894 --> 02:21:05,935
I am scared that you are leaving.

2133
02:21:06,894 --> 02:21:09,185
Back then, I was strong
that you would come.

2134
02:21:09,394 --> 02:21:12,394
Now, I am scared that you are leaving.

2135
02:21:17,435 --> 02:21:20,060
I have many friends like them
in military too.

2136
02:21:20,394 --> 02:21:24,269
A bullet suddenly hits you in the war.
One of us dies right in front.

2137
02:21:24,435 --> 02:21:28,894
That second, I am happy that I am saved
but not that I will live forever.

2138
02:21:30,602 --> 02:21:33,644
I know the next bullet is for me.
I know I will die.

2139
02:21:33,935 --> 02:21:36,310
But the reason for dying
is important.

2140
02:21:38,977 --> 02:21:39,685
Bye.

2141
02:21:51,185 --> 02:21:52,227
Sruthi.

2142
02:21:52,560 --> 02:21:54,227
Tell me, Sanjeev.
- Connect me to Suresh.

2143
02:21:54,269 --> 02:21:54,977
Ok.

2144
02:21:57,227 --> 02:21:58,644
Suresh.
- Tell me sir.

2145
02:21:58,810 --> 02:22:00,310
I am at the north phase compound.

2146
02:22:00,477 --> 02:22:01,394
One second sir.

2147
02:22:03,185 --> 02:22:05,269
I'm switching off the power for 3 minutes.
You can come in, sir

2148
02:22:05,352 --> 02:22:05,935
Ok.

2149
02:22:22,977 --> 02:22:24,352
Suresh, We are in.

2150
02:22:24,894 --> 02:22:27,352
I fixed all the cameras
like you said.

2151
02:22:27,435 --> 02:22:29,935
They will switch on right at 10pm.
- Ok good.

2152
02:22:42,394 --> 02:22:43,019
Hello.

2153
02:22:43,185 --> 02:22:44,352
Ya Amith.
- All set.

2154
02:22:44,477 --> 02:22:45,977
Ready to go.
- OK, Carry on.

2155
02:22:53,310 --> 02:22:54,102
Suresh.

2156
02:22:54,685 --> 02:22:55,352
Suresh.

2157
02:22:55,477 --> 02:22:56,352
Come on the line.

2158
02:22:56,644 --> 02:22:57,852
Suresh, where are you?

2159
02:22:58,102 --> 02:22:58,852
Suresh.

2160
02:23:00,394 --> 02:23:01,144
Suresh.

2161
02:23:04,852 --> 02:23:05,685
Suresh.

2162
02:23:06,019 --> 02:23:06,852
Suresh.

2163
02:23:07,060 --> 02:23:07,810
Suresh.

2164
02:23:07,935 --> 02:23:08,977
What happened, Sanjeev?

2165
02:23:09,144 --> 02:23:09,810
Suresh.

2166
02:23:11,560 --> 02:23:12,935
Suresh.
- Suresh.

2167
02:23:16,852 --> 02:23:17,602
Satya.

2168
02:23:17,977 --> 02:23:18,727
Satya.

2169
02:23:19,477 --> 02:23:20,060
Satya.

2170
02:23:20,602 --> 02:23:21,269
Satya.

2171
02:23:22,935 --> 02:23:23,644
Hey.

2172
02:23:24,227 --> 02:23:26,394
Do you think only you can kill?

2173
02:23:26,769 --> 02:23:29,519
You messed with us
by killing our people.

2174
02:23:30,019 --> 02:23:32,060
Shouldn’t we repay you?

2175
02:23:44,519 --> 02:23:45,894
Jai Hind.

2176
02:24:40,144 --> 02:24:41,310
Amit.

2177
02:24:43,560 --> 02:24:44,602
Amit.

2178
02:24:45,852 --> 02:24:46,810
Amit.

2179
02:24:50,894 --> 02:24:52,352
Jai Hind.

2180
02:24:53,060 --> 02:24:54,310
Amit.

2181
02:25:39,269 --> 02:25:41,852
How many people will you kill?
How many?

2182
02:25:44,769 --> 02:25:49,227
You show off as big shots but is this tainted
cigarettes business what you do?

2183
02:25:51,560 --> 02:25:55,769
Court has banned it but you have released
a new brand with the same formula.

2184
02:25:56,435 --> 02:25:57,727
Tell me... where is the formula?

2185
02:26:03,060 --> 02:26:05,144
Tell me where the formula is.
Tell me…

2186
02:26:05,394 --> 02:26:06,435
Tell me.

2187
02:26:06,560 --> 02:26:07,852
Tell me where the formula is.

2188
02:26:08,560 --> 02:26:09,352
Sanjeev.

2189
02:26:18,519 --> 02:26:19,477
Father.

2190
02:26:33,060 --> 02:26:34,602
Let's move. Move.

2191
02:26:38,144 --> 02:26:39,644
What are you staring at?

2192
02:26:44,310 --> 02:26:46,602
This is my original get up.

2193
02:26:46,769 --> 02:26:48,935
This is my original profession.

2194
02:26:49,227 --> 02:26:53,810
When everyone in your house is a rogue,
I can’t expect you to be good.

2195
02:26:55,477 --> 02:27:00,519
But your daughter thinks
you are really great.

2196
02:27:01,310 --> 02:27:02,810
What makes me a rogue?

2197
02:27:03,352 --> 02:27:05,102
I'm a successful businessman.

2198
02:27:05,602 --> 02:27:08,060
Have I pleaded people to smoke cigarette?

2199
02:27:09,144 --> 02:27:11,352
They are smoking and dying.

2200
02:27:12,102 --> 02:27:13,394
What do you want me to do?

2201
02:27:13,727 --> 02:27:16,352
Every business has a strategy.

2202
02:27:16,769 --> 02:27:21,727
Every product is publicized
to the extremes to attract audience.

2203
02:27:21,852 --> 02:27:23,019
I didn’t even do that.

2204
02:27:23,185 --> 02:27:25,019
These people follow the herd.

2205
02:27:25,727 --> 02:27:29,644
Their hope to enjoy life is more
than their hope to live.

2206
02:27:29,894 --> 02:27:33,685
They are spoiling their life
to get high for a minute.

2207
02:27:35,852 --> 02:27:38,435
I'm making cash from it.
Is it wrong?

2208
02:27:38,644 --> 02:27:40,602
There’s nothing wrong
in doing business.

2209
02:27:41,852 --> 02:27:43,644
But for your earnings,

2210
02:27:43,769 --> 02:27:50,269
you have mixed a formula in
your tainted cigarettes to make them addicts.

2211
02:27:50,810 --> 02:27:51,935
That’s wrong.

2212
02:27:53,060 --> 02:27:57,769
That’s resulting in cancer
and killing many innocents like my brother

2213
02:27:58,019 --> 02:27:59,477
Personal revenge, huh?

2214
02:27:59,810 --> 02:28:01,810
I thought you are serving the public.

2215
02:28:02,019 --> 02:28:03,560
You want the formula, right?

2216
02:28:03,935 --> 02:28:05,144
It isn’t someplace else.

2217
02:28:06,102 --> 02:28:07,977
It’s right here.

2218
02:28:09,477 --> 02:28:11,644
Even if the entire factory is on fire,

2219
02:28:12,060 --> 02:28:16,227
I'll make a cigar with the same combination
and introduce in the market again.

2220
02:28:16,644 --> 02:28:19,935
People would come running for it.

2221
02:28:20,227 --> 02:28:22,894
I would have killed you long back.

2222
02:28:23,685 --> 02:28:25,852
But if I kill you, there will be another.

2223
02:28:26,185 --> 02:28:27,685
If he dies and another.

2224
02:28:28,227 --> 02:28:30,227
I shouldn’t just kill you people

2225
02:28:31,019 --> 02:28:32,769
But people’s weakness too.

2226
02:28:34,769 --> 02:28:35,894
That's why...

2227
02:28:37,894 --> 02:28:39,227
I've waited this long

2228
02:28:39,435 --> 02:28:40,685
You saw it, right?

2229
02:28:41,019 --> 02:28:42,310
His real character.

2230
02:28:44,269 --> 02:28:45,894
Change at least now.

2231
02:28:47,060 --> 02:28:50,810
We are dying at the border
for you people

2232
02:28:53,102 --> 02:28:54,852
Our sacrifice has a meaning.

2233
02:28:55,894 --> 02:28:57,519
Your death doesn’t have a meaning.

2234
02:28:57,935 --> 02:29:01,144
Many of you are useful for the country.

2235
02:29:01,602 --> 02:29:03,227
But you are just looking
for that high.

2236
02:29:03,852 --> 02:29:05,977
You guys are dying
for one minute kick

2237
02:29:08,310 --> 02:29:10,435
Please come out of it.

2238
02:29:10,685 --> 02:29:13,935
If you don’t want to change,
come to the border with me

2239
02:29:14,144 --> 02:29:15,185
Let’s die together.

2240
02:29:15,644 --> 02:29:17,977
Your death will have a meaning then.

2241
02:29:19,185 --> 02:29:21,352
Who are you talking to?

2242
02:29:21,685 --> 02:29:24,144
You have told the people
everything yourself.

2243
02:29:24,560 --> 02:29:26,144
You told the people.

2244
02:29:29,644 --> 02:29:31,769
But your mistake here is...

2245
02:29:32,560 --> 02:29:34,394
Said the formula was in your head.

2246
02:29:36,394 --> 02:29:37,435
Mom

2247
02:29:37,852 --> 02:29:39,019
Ok?

2248
02:29:40,977 --> 02:29:43,019
Dad, ok?

2249
02:29:47,685 --> 02:29:48,352
Hey!

2250
02:29:49,435 --> 02:29:51,102
Are you ready?

2251
02:30:20,144 --> 02:30:21,852
Jai Hind

2252
02:31:23,810 --> 02:31:24,769
Ok sir.

2253
02:31:25,310 --> 02:31:27,560
Sir, Police Commissioner’s call
from Vizag

2254
02:31:27,644 --> 02:31:29,269
Sanjeev’s dead body wasn’t found
at the spot

2255
02:31:29,477 --> 02:31:30,227
You will not find it.

2256
02:31:30,394 --> 02:31:32,894
Search team assures to find it
within 24 hours

2257
02:31:32,935 --> 02:31:37,185
Even 24 years wouldn’t be enough.

2258
02:31:37,560 --> 02:31:40,352
We are all working for the paycheck.

2259
02:31:40,519 --> 02:31:42,977
But he is working for the country.

2260
02:31:43,102 --> 02:31:44,727
And, disconnect the phone.

2261
02:31:44,894 --> 02:31:47,060
Look for another case.
Ok sir.

2262
02:31:52,894 --> 02:31:53,602
Hello.

2263
02:31:54,310 --> 02:31:56,685
I didn’t expect a call from a dead man.

2264
02:31:57,435 --> 02:31:59,977
According to the records, you are dead.

2265
02:32:00,769 --> 02:32:04,394
But this nation needs your service.

2266
02:32:04,935 --> 02:32:08,060
A person like you should live.
Any time… Any day… Call me…

2267
02:32:09,144 --> 02:32:10,477
This Indian is there for you.

2268
02:32:10,685 --> 02:32:11,602
Thank you, sir.

2269
02:32:12,227 --> 02:32:13,852
There is a lot more I have to do.

2270
02:32:14,644 --> 02:32:16,602
Every step of mine is for my nation.

2271
02:32:18,769 --> 02:32:19,894
Jai Hind.
