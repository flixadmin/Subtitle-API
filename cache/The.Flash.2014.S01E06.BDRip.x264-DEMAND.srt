1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,088
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,767
When I was a child, I saw my mother killed
by something impossible.

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,361
My father went to prison for her murder.

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,521
Then an accident
made me the impossible.

5
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,646
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist...

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,283
...but secretly, I use my speed to
fight crime and find others like me.

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:30,082
And one day, I'll find who killed my mother
and get justice for my father.

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,641
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,244
Previously on The Flash:

10
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,609
Iris West.
I hear you've been writing about me.

11
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,651
- I collect posts about the Streak.
- There's no Streak.

12
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,643
I saw him, Barry. He wears a red suit.

13
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,646
I've finally diagnosed why Iris
is writing about the Streak.

14
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,847
She's doing it for me.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,130
I'm gonna find out who really killed Nora
and I'm going to get you out of here.

16
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,367
Whoever the Streak is, I am not stopping
until the rest of the world believes in him.

17
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,761
Maybe we shouldn't see each other
for a while.

18
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:13,004
To understand what I'm about to tell
you, you need to do something first.

19
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,401
You need to believe in the impossible.

20
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,483
Can you do that? Good.

21
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,524
Because all of us,
we have forgotten what miracles look like.

22
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,607
Maybe because they haven't made
much of an appearance lately. Our lives...

23
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,285
...have become ordinary.

24
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,802
But there is someone out there
who is truly extraordinary.

25
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,770
I don't know where you came from.
I don't know your name.

26
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,561
But I have seen you do the impossible
to protect the city I love.

27
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,601
So for those of us who believe in you,
and what you're doing, I just wanna say:

28
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,649
Thank you.

29
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,085
L-leh-

30
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,049
You're welcome.

31
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,449
How did you...? I literally just hit send.

32
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,687
Speed reading.

33
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,922
It's crazy what you can do to your voice.

34
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,682
You need to stop writing your blog.

35
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,490
People need to know that you exist.

36
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,521
What else can you do?

37
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,161
- This is not an interview.
- Come on, you gotta give me something.

38
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,482
Hobbies, pet peeves, favorite color.

39
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,440
- Wait, scratch that last one. Red. Obviously.
- You're not hearing me.

40
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,729
My hearing is fine, it's just selective.

41
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,166
What should I call you?

42
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,450
Anything but the Streak.

43
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,564
Fine. Suggestions?

44
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,486
You said you were writing about me
to bring hope to someone you care about.

45
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,004
How would he feel if doing that
put you in harm's way?

46
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,566
He and I aren't exactly on the same page
these days.

47
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,961
Besides, you're giving hope
to a lot of people.

48
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,804
So I'm doing this for them.

49
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,763
To be continued. Gotta run.

50
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,921
Wait. You can't just leave me up...

51
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,407
Here. Wow.

52
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,004
Woo-hoo!

53
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:44,491
- What kind of a tool steals a yellow Humvee?
- What kind of tool buys a yellow Humvee?

54
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,644
- Get these people back.
- I need everybody back.

55
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,564
Son! Out of the way! Out of the way!

56
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,049
What the hell?

57
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,645
Eddie, Eddie.

58
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,650
Yeah.

59
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,291
Step out of the vehicle.

60
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,329
If you say so.

61
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,765
Uh-oh.

62
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,842
Looks like you were born to take a beating.

63
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,286
Check the math.
Your dispersal models don't correlate.

64
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,922
Uh, they do if you factor in the seasonal
fluctuations in reproduction cycles.

65
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,246
What are we debating?

66
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,404
The average number of bugs
Barry swallows in a day of running.

67
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,647
I look forward to seeing you accept
your Nobel.

68
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,766
Barry?

69
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,883
Barry, are you okay?

70
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,365
Thirteen fractures. That's a new record.
And that's just in your hand.

71
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:53,128
You also have a concussion,
three cracked ribs and a bruised spleen.

72
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,762
Even with your powers,
you'll need a few hours to heal.

73
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:03,804
- What exactly did you hit?
- A man. A big, bad man.

74
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,727
His skin changed when I hit him.
Like it turned to metal.

75
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,804
Interesting. A man of steel.

76
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,964
So you went after a meta-human alone?

77
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,004
- Dude, why didn't you call us?
- I didn't know what he was.

78
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,091
Besides, I was off duty.

79
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,205
Hmm.

80
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,441
Lucky he didn't knock out your teeth.
Those puppies don't grow back.

81
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:33,481
- Strange thing is I feel like I knew him.
- What do you mean?

82
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,450
He said something that was familiar.

83
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,526
But he's gonna hurt someone. So how do
I fight a guy that's made of steel?

84
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:47,050
- We will find a way. Tonight, you heal.
- Yeah.

85
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,206
There was lightning
in my house. Yellow-and-red lightning.

86
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,728
There was a man in yellow.
Then I was on the street.

87
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,924
I don't know how I got there.

88
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,208
Please, you have to believe me.

89
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,689
H9)'-

90
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,561
- What happened to you last night?
- Got beat up by a steel-plated sociopath.

91
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,290
Good times.

92
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,287
- So he is meta-human.
- Yeah.

93
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,808
That particle accelerator
is the gift that keeps on giving.

94
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,924
- You okay?
- Relatively.

95
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,206
Any idea who he is?

96
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,608
Eddie's taking point
while I run down a lead.

97
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,451
- I need you to work with him until I get back.
- Why me?

98
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:36,241
Because he saw something impossible
that he's got questions about.

99
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,880
Questions that I can't answer.

100
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,761
In other words, make up
some science-y stuff to throw him off.

101
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,086
Exactly.

102
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,931
L-leh-

103
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,843
He stole the Humvee and evaded capture.

104
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,561
So pleased you could join us, Mr. Allen.
Rough night?

105
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,967
Uh, just a little beat, sir.

106
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:02,405
As I was saying, our perp yanked
three ATMs after he boosted the vehicle.

107
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,167
ATM security cameras caught him on video.
We got a hit in the database.

108
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:11,611
Tony Woodward. History of violence, petty
theft, assault, going way back to juvie.

109
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,484
Dropped off the radar 10 months ago.

110
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,401
Looks like he's back.

111
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,289
Increased pressure produces heat, and if
you don't release it, you get combustion.

112
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,011
I don't know how do you remember
all this stuff, Barry.

113
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,731
Because he's a little freak.
Just like his old man.

114
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,645
- Don't talk about my dad.
- Or what?

115
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,529
Is he going to murder me too?

116
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,331
Looks like you were born
to take a beating, Allen.

117
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,130
Allen.

118
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,170
Hey, Allen.

119
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,526
- Hey.
- You Okay?

120
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,326
Hey, yeah. Sorry, Eddie.

121
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:52,202
Listen, I saw something last night
I just can't get my head around.

122
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,600
Uh-huh.

123
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:59,489
I fired a dozen rounds at our car thief
and it was like they sparked off of him.

124
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,170
Huh.

125
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,405
Well, I mean, he must have been
wearing some kind of body armor.

126
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,965
On his face?

127
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,167
- Um...
- Hey.

128
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,606
Barf)'-

129
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,331
Hi, babe, I saw the news. Are you okay?

130
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,371
I'm fine. Which you'd know if you checked
your messages. I tried you three times.

131
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:23,525
Sorry, I had to work late.

132
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,844
Um, so I heard that the Streak saved a kid.
Any comment, detective?

133
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,122
All I know is our perp got away.

134
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,408
But Barry here is gonna help me find him.

135
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,721
- Yeah.
- Fine.

136
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,969
I have other sources. I
will see you tonight.

137
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,729
- Bye.
- Bye.

138
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,370
- What is going on with you two?
- What do you mean? Nothing.

139
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,485
It's fine. it's... It's fine. I don't know.

140
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,330
Okay.

141
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,169
- Dr. Wells.
- I guess you heard about...

142
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,006
...Barry's incident last night. If you're
looking for him, he's at the station.

143
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,525
I came here to see you.

144
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,846
- I need your help solving an old case.
- What case is that?

145
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,241
The murder of Barry's mother.

146
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,047
Your childhood nemesis
is now an unstoppable meta-human.

147
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:30,285
- That is seriously messed up.
- I had a childhood nemesis.

148
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,484
Lexi La Roche.
She used to put gum in my hair.

149
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,766
Jake Puckett.

150
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,969
If I didn't let him copy my homework,
he'd give me a swirly.

151
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,691
Now that we've established
that we're all uber-nerds...

152
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,889
...what are we gonna do about Tony?
Glad you asked.

153
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,886
We're gonna train you, man.
Karate Kid style.

154
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,801
Behold.

155
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,163
- I call him Girder.
- For the record, not my idea.

156
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,924
Fighting is physics.

157
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:02,523
It's not about strength, it's not about
size, it's about energy and power.

158
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:06,082
Channel your speed the right way,
you can totally take this bad boy down.

159
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,644
Now, obviously,
your Girder is a moving target.

160
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,004
So...

161
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,802
I have ice and bandages standing by.

162
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,486
I'm pretty sure
I just dislocated my shoulder.

163
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,451
Okay, not gonna lie. This is
gonna be quick but extremely painful.

164
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,243
Oh, speaking of pain. Eddie, hey.

165
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,404
We found the stolen Humvee
in the alley at Fremont and Lawrence.

166
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,201
- Need you down here to do your thing.
- Great, I'll see you in a sec.

167
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,166
Okay. Okay, let's do this.

168
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:08,171
So, Barry, when you said
you were off duty last night...

169
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,723
...you weren't visiting Iris again,
you know, in disguise?

170
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,121
That would be reckless and a little creepy.

171
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,763
- Nope.
- Good.

172
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,730
- Allen, you really need a car.
- I usually manage on foot okay.

173
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,927
What do we got?

174
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,048
The rig Tony Woodward
boosted last night.

175
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,647
No sign of the stolen ATMs,
probably got those where he's holed up.

176
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,724
Though he's going to have
a hell of time breaking them open.

177
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,201
I wouldn't be so sure.

178
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,162
- So about you and Iris.
- Look, Eddie, we had a fight...

179
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,563
...and I just don't really feel comfortable
talking about it with you.

180
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:54,248
I get that. And I get that you two
go way back.

181
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,051
To be honest,
I was a little threatened by you at first.

182
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,966
- You were threatened by me?
- Sure.

183
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:04,284
I mean, I've seen how close you two are,
but you seem like a good guy...

184
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,809
...and Iris, I just want her to be happy.
From my experience...

185
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,971
- ...good friends are hard to find.
- Detective. Excuse me.

186
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,446
Sir, we ran the plates on that Humvee...

187
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:21,163
- Come on, Barry, you can do it.
- Bar, focus.

188
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,729
- I am.
- Son, son, you're getting frustrated.

189
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,168
You need to learn
how to control your emotions.

190
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:33,245
- Iris, come here, sweetie.
- You want me to hit a girl?

191
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,925
He wants you to try.

192
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,521
Relax, Barry, I've had her in gloves
since she was 6.

193
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,330
She's tougher than she looks.

194
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,123
Sorry, Barry.

195
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:59,489
Son, sometimes the best way
to win a fight is not to start one...

196
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:03,804
...but if you do come up against somebody
you know you can't beat, be smart.

197
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,724
It's okay to run the other way.

198
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,370
All right?

199
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,291
So, what do you think?

200
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,522
Judging by the mud and kegs...

201
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:17,005
...I'd say he got hammered,
stole a big-ass truck and went joy-riding.

202
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,881
I bet the kegs are stolen too. Rusty Iron
Ale. It's a microbrew right over in...

203
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,930
- Keystone. I know it. Let's check it out.
- Yeah.

204
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:42,090
Barry described a tornado
of red-and-yellow lightning...

205
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,891
...inside a man in yellow.

206
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,284
Then, barn, he's blocks away, on the
street, doesn't know how he got there.

207
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,842
- When I arrived, the place was a wreck.
- Nora Allen is dead.

208
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,163
Single stab wound to the heart.
Henry Allen covered in her blood.

209
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,527
Despite all the evidence
that Henry is guilty...

210
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:02,890
...now you believe this man in yellow
is responsible?

211
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,010
Last night I saw Barry rescue
a young boy from being run over...

212
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,642
...and it looked exactly like
what Barry described happened to him.

213
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:14,249
It got me thinking, what if somebody
with Barry's abilities killed Nora?

214
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:21,769
There's one flaw with your theory, detective,
and that is all of this happened 14 years ago.

215
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,081
Which is long before...

216
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,210
- Your machine gave Barry powers.
- An accident gave Barry powers.

217
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:31,361
Do you think it is possible
that somebody with Barry's super speed...

218
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,522
...could have existed before the explosion?

219
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,684
Detective, I deal in probabilities
as a scientist.

220
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,204
And in this case, it's highly unlikely.

221
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:54,402
Gentlemen. C.C.P.D. Any chance some of
your merchandise was stolen last night?

222
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,764
No. I don't think so.

223
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,645
How about this guy. You seen him?

224
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,482
You know Tony, don't you?

225
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,244
H9)'-

226
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,131
Allen, come on.

227
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,049
- Allen, you okay?
- Oh, never better.

228
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,965
- Get up.
- Unh. I didn't do nothing, man.

229
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,246
So why did you run?

230
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,165
- Look, it was an accident.
- What was?

231
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,288
Tony falling, okay?

232
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,729
- But I swear to God, we didn't kill him.
- Keep talking.

233
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,565
About 10 months ago, Keystone Ironworks.

234
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,442
Boss was handing out pink slips.
Tony gets his and he just snapped.

235
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,047
He started beating the crap out of the guy.
We pulled him off.

236
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,289
Then the lights went out,
some kind of power surge...

237
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:02,445
...and Tony went over the railing
right into a vat of molten scrap.

238
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,002
- Just gone.
- Lucky for you, he's still alive.

239
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,083
What?

240
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,971
- How did you get in front of us?
- Shortcut.

241
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,851
I've been meaning to ask you,
where's your shadow?

242
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,927
- What shadow?
- Barry.

243
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:26,880
- He hasn't been in all week.
- Getting his fix somewhere else.

244
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,170
Too bad. He's cute.

245
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,766
I kind of miss having him around.

246
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,486
Iris? Long time, no see.

247
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,487
I gotta say, Iris, you look amazing.

248
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:52,965
- Thanks, Tony. Um, you too.
- Oh. Yeah, I keep in shape.

249
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,169
Got a gym at my place.
Been living out in Keystone. The west side.

250
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,563
You should, uh, stop by sometime.

251
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,808
So, uh, can I get you a drink?

252
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,689
No, I came to see you.

253
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,690
- How did you know I was here?
- Been reading up on the Streak.

254
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,330
Found your little blog.

255
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,366
- Why are you writing about this guy?
- People say that he's a hero.

256
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,171
I say he's a coward.

257
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:20,206
I happen to know that he took a beating
last night and ran off like a little girl.

258
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,964
You should write about that.

259
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:28,008
Do you, uh, have any idea
who leather boy is?

260
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,525
No clue.

261
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,889
So, urn, if you don't want to drink,
I should get back to work.

262
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,520
Actually, I'd prefer to buy you a drink.

263
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,966
What time are you off?

264
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:41,363
Thanks, Tony, but I don't think
my boyfriend would approve.

265
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:46,287
- He's a cop, like my dad.
- I never really did like cops too much.

266
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,045
Iris.

267
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:55,162
Well, he's picking me up
for the policeman's ball.

268
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,648
Wall-to-wall cops, can't swing a cat,
I should call to see where he is.

269
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,485
Give me the phone, Iris. Now!

270
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,881
Sorry.

271
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,482
For the damage.

272
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,887
We'll pick this up some other time.

273
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,082
Barry. Check it out.

274
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:34,004
The gravel you pulled from Tony's ride?
It contains 76.8 percent hematite...

275
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,925
...consistent with the mines
at Keystone Ironworks.

276
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:41,051
Which closed down 10 months ago.
It's the perfect hideout.

277
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,449
Barry? Do you mind telling me about this?

278
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,047
"I have info about someone
you're looking for. He was here.

279
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,929
You know where to find me."

280
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,844
Now who could she be talking to?

281
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,921
- I guess you got my message.
- Are you okay?

282
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,128
Cop's daughter. I can handle myself.

283
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,764
- Not with this guy.
- I knew him when we were kids.

284
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,321
He didn't want to hurt me.
He wanted to impress me.

285
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,245
But he is fixated on you
and not in a good way.

286
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,925
Do you know where he went?

287
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,321
Said he had a place in West Keystone.

288
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,484
Bragged about how big it was,
but I have no idea where.

289
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,610
- I do.
- Wait. There's something else.

290
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,967
His hand, it transformed.

291
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,487
Like an iron fist.

292
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,842
- He's like you, isn't he?
- Yes.

293
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,480
And writing about me
is what brought him to you.

294
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,648
- I know but maybe I can talk to him...
- No.

295
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,006
He's too dangerous.

296
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,407
Damn, that's my ride.
Eddie insisted on a detail. I have to...

297
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,170
...go.

298
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,008
Barry, talk to us. What are you doing?

299
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,888
Dude, don't run angry.
We don't know how to defeat him yet.

300
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,966
This is definitely the place.

301
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,445
You're trespassing, freak.

302
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,569
There's nowhere left to run.

303
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,409
- Barry?
- Barry, where are you?

304
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,608
Caitlin, over here.

305
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,364
Barry?

306
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:18,690
Please say something.
Say something so we know you're okay.

307
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,846
- Ow.
- Get him out of there.

308
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,771
What were you thinking?
What were you thinking?

309
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,685
I told you that we would figure out
a way to deal with him.

310
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,207
- I'll heal.
- You can't heal when you're dead.

311
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,921
- He could have killed you.
- I know, all right? I know.

312
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,283
In the past 36 hours,
I've had my ass handed to me twice...

313
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,283
...by the guy that tortured me as a kid.

314
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,966
I couldn't stop him then
and I can't stop him now.

315
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,930
Even with my powers,
I'm still powerless against him.

316
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,924
Not necessarily. Cisco.

317
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:54,240
Any material,
if struck at a high enough velocity...

318
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,766
...can be compromised.

319
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,651
We ran an analysis on the metal
in Tony's footprint.

320
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:04,727
Based on its density and atomic structure,
if you impact it at just the right angle...

321
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,043
...at just the right speed,
you could do some serious damage.

322
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,962
- How fast would I have to go?
- Factoring in the metal's tensile strength...

323
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:16,642
...estimated dermal thickness,
atmospheric pressure, air temp...

324
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,690
...you'd have to hit him
at approximately...

325
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,801
...Mach 1.1.

326
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,004
You want Barry to hit something
at 800 miles an hour?

327
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:30,006
- Eight hundred thirty-seven, actually.
- That's faster than the speed of sound.

328
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:36,008
I know. He would create a sonic boom,
which, as I said before, would be awesome.

329
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,527
- I've never gone that fast.
- Yet.

330
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:42,324
I can't believe we're actually
entertaining this idea.

331
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,364
I mean, he'd need a straight shot
from miles away.

332
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,171
Yeah, 5.3 miles, theoretically.

333
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,886
Do it right, you'll take him down.

334
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,329
Do it wrong,
you'll shatter every bone in your body.

335
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,966
- Barry.
- Joe, I've been beaten enough for one day.

336
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,043
- I gotta...
- Hey, wait.

337
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,130
An anonymous tip led us
to Tony Woodward's hideout.

338
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,089
The place was trashed. What happened?

339
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,971
He showed up at Jitters to see Iris.
I had to go after him.

340
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,202
- Iris? Where is she?
- She's fine, she's fine.

341
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,283
Eddie put a detail on her to be safe.

342
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,569
I thought I could handle him this time.
I tried.

343
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,405
Look, I know what this punk
put you through...

344
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:29,245
...but you can't let emotion
cloud yourjudgment.

345
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:34,121
Toll-booth camera got a shot of Woodward.
Stolen car headed out of town.

346
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,483
State police are taking over. We lost him.

347
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,569
Don't worry, Eddie. They'll get him.

348
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:43,008
- I wanted to take this guy down.
- Not half as much as I did.

349
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,246
- Let's go, Allen.
- Go where?

350
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,880
Blow off some steam.
I need to hit something.

351
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,646
- What?
- I don't think he meant hit you. Go.

352
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,761
So I heard you and this Woodward guy
have a history.

353
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,171
Hey, Allen, it's okay.

354
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,761
Trust me, I had my fair share of bullies
at school.

355
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,729
Somehow I find that hard to believe.

356
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:19,123
I was short, fat, and the son of a politician
who closed a factory in my school district.

357
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,926
So not so popular.

358
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,569
So, what did you do about it?

359
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,765
I got my ass kicked. A lot.

360
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:35,121
Until my gym coach took pity on me. Ha, ha.

361
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,971
She said the key to fighting is patience.

362
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,451
Here.

363
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,850
A lot of guys waste energy
trying to land the most punches.

364
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,482
All it takes is one.

365
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,563
But you gotta make it count.

366
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,087
Choose your spot and drive through it.

367
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,484
Like it's 6 inches behind the target.

368
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,727
Harder.

369
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,367
Harder.

370
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,248
The seam was starting to split.

371
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,160
Appreciate you coming down.

372
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:31,326
Mm. These days, it's rare to find someone
happy to have a drink with me.

373
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:36,925
Well, our conversation yesterday
got me thinking.

374
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,931
You said as a scientist,
you look for the probable.

375
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,161
That's right.

376
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:46,121
And we've both recently seen things
that have redefined what is possible.

377
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:50,169
Yes, we have, and we both know
the direct cause of those things.

378
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,129
Your accelerator explosion.

379
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:55,887
Evolutionary leaps follow the creation
of new technologies. It's that simple.

380
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:59,203
Like the Roomba. Ha-ha-ha.

381
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,371
Yes, like the Roomba.

382
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,291
So humor me here.

383
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,690
If we know that...

384
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,204
...meta-humans were created
by the particle accelerator...

385
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,802
...and testimony shows that a meta-human
may have been involved...

386
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,009
...in the murder of Barry Allen's mother
14 years ago...

387
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,204
...it seems to me that way back then...

388
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,001
...there must have been
another particle accelerator.

389
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,965
Another particle accelerator?

390
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,246
Mm.

391
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:39,851
I can assure you that's extremely unlikely,
detective, and if there were...

392
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,527
...I don't recall any dark-matter
lightning storms before I moved to town.

393
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,881
Do you?

394
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,090
No.

395
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,401
No, I don't.

396
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,242
When did you move to town, Dr. Wells?

397
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,922
Something tells me that you already know
the answer to that question, detective.

398
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:12,125
This whole "help you solve
the murder of Nora Allen"...

399
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,600
You were never looking for my help,
were you?

400
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:20,970
You opened your lab
a month after Nora Allen's murder.

401
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,283
You mind telling me what you were doing
in Central City before that?

402
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,130
I was starting over.

403
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,130
Starting what over?

404
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:41,324
Well, here I thought we were just
two guys having a friendly drink.

405
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,763
You want answers, detective?
Tess Morgan. Look her up.

406
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:00,521
Unit 52, this is Dispatch.
Requesting status on the West house.

407
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,806
Hey, Iris.

408
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,088
- Nice, Allen. All right.
- Yeah. Okay.

409
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,203
Hey, next time work on your speed.

410
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:31,569
Yeah. I'll do my best.

411
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,046
Thawne, Allen.

412
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,851
The unit watching Joe's daughter,
they've been attacked.

413
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,769
Iris is missing.

414
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,567
Go, all right? I'll call Joe.

415
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:48,201
Let's adjust the impact angle by 0.2
degrees, up the speed to 838...

416
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,524
Barn.

417
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,883
- Ouch.
- Ouch?

418
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,200
- Guys, you there?
- Yeah, man. What's up?

419
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:01,728
Tony took Iris. I need you to do
whatever you can to help me find her.

420
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,645
- Satellites, security cameras, hack them all.
- We're on it.

421
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,881
What's wrong?

422
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,447
Remember this place, Iris?

423
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,002
So, what's the plan here, Tony?

424
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,089
Finally gonna go for that G.E.D.?

425
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,925
You want a plan?
You used to write about the Streak, right?

426
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,970
- Now you're gonna write about me.
- You just abducted me, Tony.

427
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:34,125
- Why would I do that?
- Because the Streak is dead.

428
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,691
- No.
- Yeah.

429
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,968
Squashed like a little bug, by me.

430
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:41,289
If you don't want the same thing
to happen to you, tell the world...

431
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:44,211
...that there's a new big man on campus!

432
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,522
And I'm just getting started.

433
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,083
You could have anybody
write about you, Tony. Why me?

434
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:53,284
Because I like you, Iris. Always have.

435
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,805
You should have said something.

436
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:07,368
You try anything like that again
and I'm gonna leave more than a bruise.

437
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,964
Eddie, anything yet?

438
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,169
We have roadblocks on every major artery.
Units are searching.

439
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,970
We will find Iris, Joe.

440
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,405
You don't think he'll hurt her, do you?

441
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:27,329
Sir. Sir. We got a fire alarm call
at Carmichael Elementary.

442
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,642
Dispatch the fire department.
We'll send backup.

443
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,167
- That's the school you and Iris went to.
- And Tony.

444
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,004
Go.

445
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:44,091
Tony, turn yourself in before
things get worse. It's not too late.

446
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,850
Yeah, it is.

447
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,490
Cops are already looking for me.

448
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,161
So get ready to cover
the showdown of a lifetime...

449
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,891
...because I'm not going
out without a fight.

450
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,810
Good, because you just found one.

451
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,083
You just won't stay dead.

452
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,681
Come to save your little fangirl?

453
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,684
This is between us. Let her go.

454
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:14,688
Oh, I could. But I'd rather make her watch
while I break every bone in your body.

455
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,526
- Wait here.
- Okay.

456
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,885
Too slow, Tin Man.

457
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:41,205
I've known guys like you.
Peaked in high school, never got over it.

458
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:46,042
All these powers, and look at you.
Bully then, bully now.

459
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,365
He's hurt.

460
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,730
No!

461
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,889
If you do come up against somebody
you know you can't beat, be smart.

462
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,485
It's okay to run the other way.

463
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,930
There goes your hero.

464
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,606
He made it out. Barely.

465
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:48,166
- Why did he stop?
- He's miles away.

466
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,649
5.3 miles away.

467
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,965
- Barry, wait.
- No way. He's gonna do it.

468
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,485
Go, man, go!

469
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,644
Supersonic punch, baby! Whoo!

470
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,321
Nice cross.

471
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,003
- I think I broke my hand.
- Me too.

472
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,285
Hey!

473
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,930
What is this? Where the hell am I?

474
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:09,044
Somewhere you'll never hurt anyone
ever again.

475
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,721
Who the hell do you think you are?

476
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,044
You know who I am.

477
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,761
Allen?

478
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,369
The thing that happened to you, Tony,
it happened to me too.

479
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:29,801
But it didn't just give us abilities.
It made us more of who we are.

480
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,286
You got strong.

481
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,809
I got fast.

482
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,927
Fast enough to beat you.

483
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:41,920
You used your gift to hurt people.

484
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,881
Not anymore.

485
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,644
Allen.

486
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,450
Allen.

487
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,649
Allen, don't walk away from me, Allen!
Hey! Come back here!

488
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,723
Allen! Allen!

489
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,120
Dude. That had to feel great.

490
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,931
- You have no idea.
- Almost as good as proving me wrong...

491
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,491
...about the supersonic punch?

492
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:07,287
Actually, that part hurt. Like, a lot.

493
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,241
But I couldn't have done it
without you guys.

494
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,928
All I wanna know is, which childhood bully
are we gonna take down next?

495
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,684
- Mine or Caitlin's?
- Oh, yeah.

496
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:20,322
I vote mine. What? Guys,
this is not a joke.

497
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,850
- Doctor.
- Detective.

498
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,329
Are you here to make more accusations?

499
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,002
I'm here to make amends.

500
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,851
I looked up Tess Morgan.

501
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,089
Sorry for your loss.

502
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,287
You two were research partners
in Maryland?

503
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:53,480
Yes, we were. We were married to the work
as much as to each other.

504
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:59,124
After the car accident,
I could not go back to the work.

505
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,643
Could not go back to our lab.

506
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,961
So you moved here.

507
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,322
Where no one knew me.

508
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,322
Where no one could remind me
of what I had lost.

509
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,164
And I've found it difficult.

510
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,327
Starting over, you know...

511
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,009
...rebuilding.

512
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:32,082
And what took me 14 years,
Tess could have done in four.

513
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,050
Believe me, she...

514
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:43,000
At the time of Nora Allen's murder...

515
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:46,244
...the particle accelerator
that I would eventually create...

516
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,244
...was but a notion, much less a reality.

517
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:53,610
And so whomever,
or whatever is responsible for her death...

518
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,843
...it did not originate from me
or from my work.

519
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,284
I'm sorry I doubted you.

520
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:05,806
But I hope I can still count on your help.

521
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,131
- You don't give up, do you?
- Nope.

522
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,044
Not till I get my man.

523
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,964
I owe that to Barry and to Henry.

524
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,406
Barry is lucky to have
you on his side, Joe.

525
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,881
Yeah I knew that you saw me
You laughed when I looked back

526
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,811
Hi.

527
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,081
Oh, I thought that you were someone else.

528
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:49,011
So Joe told me what happened.

529
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,569
How's the hand?

530
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,727
Not broken, so that's something. Heh.

531
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:59,521
Do you want to get understood?

532
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,771
- I should have believe...
- I'm sorry I said...

533
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,085
I've missed you.

534
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,648
Yeah, I've missed you too.

535
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,166
When I heard Tony took you, l...

536
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:19,363
I just... I don't know what I would do
if anything happened to you.

537
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:24,285
Well, my guardian angel
is looking out for me.

538
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,444
Do you wanna hang out, catch up?

539
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,126
Yeah. I would like that, yeah.

540
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,442
I promise not to talk about
the Streak tonight.

541
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,961
No, I want you to. No, I mean, you can...

542
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,726
I want you to talk about
whatever you wanna talk about.

543
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,327
- I know it's important to you.
- Good, because it's not just the Streak.

544
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,968
There are others out
there that are like him.

545
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:50,001
I've gotten scattered posts about this guy
that's on fire, except that he doesn't burn up.

546
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,691
Okay, wait, wait.

547
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,241
You're trying to find
the Burning Man now too?

548
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,041
Yeah, why not? I mean, a lot can happen
in a week, especially with the Streak.

549
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,531
Yeah.

550
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,331
I've been trying to get answers.
Where does he come from?

551
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,563
How does he do what he does?
But he dodges everything, literally...

552
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,321
...with this super-speed power.

553
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:12,563
When he moves, Barry,
you don't even see him.

554
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,922
He comes and goes in the blink of an eye,
in a...

555
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,320
Flash?

556
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,843
In a flash.

557
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,761
Yeah. Heh.

558
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:39,726
Today, I was saved by the impossible.
A mystery man.

559
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,370
The fastest man alive.

560
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,963
Then a friend gave me an idea
for a new name.

561
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:50,011
And something tells me it's gonna catch on.
