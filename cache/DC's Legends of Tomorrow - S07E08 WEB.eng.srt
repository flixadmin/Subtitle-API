1
00:00:01,246 --> 00:00:03,627
It all started when a man named Bishop

2
00:00:03,651 --> 00:00:05,795
created a team of robots.

3
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:09,432
He sent them back in time with one goal:

4
00:00:09,456 --> 00:00:13,270
To destroy the 20th century.

5
00:00:13,294 --> 00:00:14,804
These machines were programmed

6
00:00:14,828 --> 00:00:17,226
to think that they were beyond human.

7
00:00:18,799 --> 00:00:21,244
That they were superheroes.

8
00:00:21,268 --> 00:00:23,647
They made their way cross-country,

9
00:00:23,671 --> 00:00:26,683
murdering some of the
greatest figures in history.

10
00:00:26,707 --> 00:00:27,950
Famous lawmen

11
00:00:27,974 --> 00:00:29,319
and men of science.

12
00:00:29,343 --> 00:00:31,243
Great Scott!

13
00:00:32,112 --> 00:00:33,722
Finally, they kidnapped

14
00:00:33,746 --> 00:00:36,225
the inventor of time travel itself

15
00:00:36,249 --> 00:00:38,527
and, with his help, set their sights

16
00:00:38,551 --> 00:00:40,829
on destroying all of history.

17
00:00:40,853 --> 00:00:44,500
No one could stop
these so-called legends,

18
00:00:44,524 --> 00:00:46,034
not until we came along,

19
00:00:46,058 --> 00:00:48,403
the real flesh-and-blood superheroes

20
00:00:48,427 --> 00:00:51,540
whose job it is to put
history back on track.

21
00:00:51,564 --> 00:00:55,499
We are the real Legends of Tomorrow.

22
00:01:03,376 --> 00:01:05,221
- Gonna go get some drinks, okay?
- _.

23
00:01:05,245 --> 00:01:07,022
- You know, I'll tell you what.
- What?

24
00:01:07,046 --> 00:01:08,790
You made a pretty kick-ass boss.

25
00:01:08,814 --> 00:01:10,925
Okay, I can't tell.
Is that your serious voice,

26
00:01:10,949 --> 00:01:11,993
or your making-fun-of-me voice?

27
00:01:12,017 --> 00:01:14,395
Oh, just take the compliment.

28
00:01:14,419 --> 00:01:16,264
Come on.

29
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:17,920
Oh, God.

30
00:01:31,603 --> 00:01:34,982
The device can read
all of Gideon's thoughts.

31
00:01:35,006 --> 00:01:36,217
We got eyes on Bishop.

32
00:01:36,241 --> 00:01:38,152
Bishop. What a lame-ass name.

33
00:01:38,176 --> 00:01:39,621
If you'll allow me to install it,

34
00:01:39,645 --> 00:01:41,521
I should have you ready
to jump in 30 minutes.

35
00:01:41,545 --> 00:01:43,023
Well, it looks like he managed to save

36
00:01:43,047 --> 00:01:44,626
the time-terrorists' ship.

37
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:46,927
Oh, I can't wait to smash
that janky-ass piece of junk.

38
00:01:46,951 --> 00:01:48,393
- I'm gonna...
- Cool it, Steel.

39
00:01:48,417 --> 00:01:50,517
Not until we have IDs on all of them.

40
00:01:54,393 --> 00:01:56,738
We've got eyes on three bots.

41
00:01:56,762 --> 00:01:59,439
These dicks are having a party.

42
00:01:59,463 --> 00:02:00,707
Idiots.

43
00:02:00,731 --> 00:02:01,842
"Way to go, Legends.

44
00:02:01,866 --> 00:02:03,911
We totally screwed up the timeline".

45
00:02:03,935 --> 00:02:05,980
"Oh? Again".

46
00:02:06,004 --> 00:02:08,882
Hey babe, would you rather
take out robo-you or robo-me?

47
00:02:08,906 --> 00:02:09,917
Both.

48
00:02:09,941 --> 00:02:12,820
Hey, you just leave
robo-me for me, okay?

49
00:02:12,844 --> 00:02:14,588
Nobody's taking out anybody

50
00:02:14,612 --> 00:02:17,010
until these civilians clear out.

51
00:02:21,152 --> 00:02:22,863
Thank God.

52
00:02:22,887 --> 00:02:26,834
Their sad little dance party
is finally breaking up.

53
00:02:26,858 --> 00:02:29,622
Gary, on my mark,
you're gonna kill the lights.

54
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:34,574
No, Gary, we're not gonna
save one so you can eat it.

55
00:02:34,598 --> 00:02:37,111
They're droids. How dumb is he?

56
00:02:37,135 --> 00:02:39,446
Here we go.

57
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:42,671
Three, two, one!

58
00:02:49,814 --> 00:02:52,793
She's here.

59
00:02:52,817 --> 00:02:54,647
Move, move!

60
00:03:01,058 --> 00:03:03,489
All right, come on.
Time machine's this way.

61
00:03:05,896 --> 00:03:08,093
- And now it's that way.
- You could've parked closer.

62
00:03:20,077 --> 00:03:21,988
Eat lead, you stupid droids.

63
00:03:22,012 --> 00:03:23,189
We've got 'em now.

64
00:03:23,213 --> 00:03:24,557
Get down!

65
00:03:24,581 --> 00:03:25,847
Go, go! Get down!

66
00:03:27,517 --> 00:03:30,663
They're pinned down. I'm moving in.

67
00:03:30,687 --> 00:03:32,254
I'll cover you.

68
00:03:39,797 --> 00:03:41,074
No!

69
00:03:41,098 --> 00:03:42,727
Go! Go! Come on.

70
00:03:44,167 --> 00:03:48,000
I've got Bishop. Stay on the androids.

71
00:04:02,684 --> 00:04:05,383
_

72
00:04:11,393 --> 00:04:14,239
We have two down.

73
00:04:14,263 --> 00:04:16,508
Where's the target?

74
00:04:16,532 --> 00:04:19,411
Bishop's been eliminated,
Legends got away.

75
00:04:19,435 --> 00:04:21,613
God damn it!

76
00:04:21,637 --> 00:04:24,449
Get these two to the med bay ASAP.

77
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:26,351
Those Legends might have
got away this time,

78
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:28,253
but mark my words,

79
00:04:28,277 --> 00:04:30,811
those suckers are gonna pay for this.

80

- Synced and corrected by Firefly -

81
00:05:04,813 --> 00:05:06,825
I should've never let
these two out in the field.

82
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:08,426
Well, at least we got one of theirs.

83
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:10,614
What happened to Bishop's body?

84
00:05:11,954 --> 00:05:13,917
Ah, damn, Gary. Your breath is terrible.

85
00:05:15,157 --> 00:05:18,102
No, you can't eat them.
These are your teammates.

86
00:05:18,126 --> 00:05:19,155
Or they were.

87
00:05:21,129 --> 00:05:22,506
I will avenge you, Zari.

88
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:26,499
I'll avenge you first, Astra.

89
00:05:28,136 --> 00:05:30,147
Get them to the infirmary, stat.

90
00:05:30,171 --> 00:05:31,949
Can't you see that they're dead?

91
00:05:31,973 --> 00:05:33,584
Don't tell me how to run my OR,

92
00:05:33,608 --> 00:05:35,975
and I won't tell you how
to run your team, Captain.

93
00:05:38,813 --> 00:05:40,276
Bring them to me.

94
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:48,565
Gideon!

95
00:05:48,589 --> 00:05:50,334
Yes, Captain Lance?

96
00:05:50,358 --> 00:05:52,269
Keep an eye on the timeline.

97
00:05:52,293 --> 00:05:55,758
It won't be long before those
idiots screw something else up.

98
00:06:02,936 --> 00:06:05,715
Gideon, weren't the evil
versions of us just in Russia?

99
00:06:05,739 --> 00:06:07,183
You are correct, Mr. Heywood.

100
00:06:07,207 --> 00:06:09,219
But the repercussions
of the events they altered

101
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:11,654
are just starting to be felt
throughout the timeline.

102
00:06:11,678 --> 00:06:12,922
Where are they now?

103
00:06:12,946 --> 00:06:14,391
Unclear, Captain.

104
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:17,027
It appears their team has gone dark.

105
00:06:17,051 --> 00:06:19,062
There's a lot of red
on that time thingy.

106
00:06:19,086 --> 00:06:22,798
And one thing I do know, red ain't good.

107
00:06:22,822 --> 00:06:23,934
It's that kind of insight

108
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:25,668
that makes you my right-hand man.

109
00:06:25,692 --> 00:06:28,905
I thought it was 'cause
I'm strong as steel.

110
00:06:28,929 --> 00:06:30,540
And always hard.

111
00:06:30,564 --> 00:06:32,008
I was joking.

112
00:06:32,032 --> 00:06:33,676
Ha, got me! Good.

113
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,646
But seriously, you ever
wonder why Bishop built

114
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:39,215
a bunch of time-traveling
rogues that look like us?

115
00:06:39,239 --> 00:06:41,517
'Cause he's a dick,
and he hates history.

116
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:45,187
Doesn't make any sense.

117
00:06:45,211 --> 00:06:48,024
I mean, why would they make it
so some '20s songbird

118
00:06:48,048 --> 00:06:50,392
doesn't get offed by her boyfriend?

119
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:54,396
A bunch of World War II factory
workers get a promotion.

120
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,866
There's gotta be some
rhyme or reason to it.

121
00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:00,169
They seem to love saving
history's greatest nobodies.

122
00:07:00,193 --> 00:07:02,672
Eh, I wouldn't think
about it too much, Captain.

123
00:07:02,696 --> 00:07:04,574
Sorry.

124
00:07:04,598 --> 00:07:07,209
You're probably right.

125
00:07:07,233 --> 00:07:09,344
Let's get back to the task at hand.

126
00:07:09,368 --> 00:07:10,846
Cleaning up the Legends' mess,

127
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,682
so we can finally catch up to them.

128
00:07:12,706 --> 00:07:13,783
And this one

129
00:07:13,807 --> 00:07:16,619
is gonna require a major cleanup.

130
00:07:16,643 --> 00:07:20,022
Gideon, plot a course to Ukraine, 1986.

131
00:07:20,046 --> 00:07:23,258
So we can punch history back into shape!

132
00:07:23,282 --> 00:07:26,280
_

133
00:07:27,953 --> 00:07:29,764
All right team, it's go time.

134
00:07:29,788 --> 00:07:31,567
Gideon hasn't been able to identify

135
00:07:31,591 --> 00:07:33,335
the exact nature of the aberration.

136
00:07:33,359 --> 00:07:34,603
Why not?

137
00:07:34,627 --> 00:07:36,004
I thought she was a supercomputer.

138
00:07:36,028 --> 00:07:37,758
'Cause time's like cement, dumb-ass.

139
00:07:39,265 --> 00:07:41,243
Just something Gideon used to say.

140
00:07:41,267 --> 00:07:43,145
Whatever.

141
00:07:43,169 --> 00:07:45,214
Time to rock and roll.

142
00:07:45,238 --> 00:07:48,083
Time to save history for Astra.

143
00:07:48,107 --> 00:07:49,684
For Zari.

144
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:51,386
Now, that's sweet, brother.

145
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:54,056
Yeah, I'm really touched, Spooner.

146
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,324
What?

147
00:07:55,348 --> 00:07:56,825
They're alive?

148
00:07:56,849 --> 00:07:59,294
Try not to have too much fun without me.

149
00:07:59,318 --> 00:08:01,563
We're locating the epicenter for you.

150
00:08:01,587 --> 00:08:03,797
So much for avenging their death.

151
00:08:03,821 --> 00:08:04,999
It's just as well.

152
00:08:05,023 --> 00:08:07,268
Gideon designated this
a no-kill mission.

153
00:08:07,292 --> 00:08:10,004
- Oh, come on!
- So what are these?

154
00:08:10,028 --> 00:08:11,839
I made them special for the mission.

155
00:08:11,863 --> 00:08:13,474
I call them Destiny Restoration Devices.

156
00:08:13,498 --> 00:08:14,675
Oh, what does it do?

157
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:16,044
I could take the time to explain

158
00:08:16,068 --> 00:08:17,178
the exact science to you.

159
00:08:17,202 --> 00:08:18,513
Science is lame.

160
00:08:18,537 --> 00:08:19,580
You're lame!

161
00:08:19,604 --> 00:08:20,748
Nice comeback.

162
00:08:20,772 --> 00:08:22,049
Where'd you get that? Your mom?

163
00:08:22,073 --> 00:08:23,817
Knock it off, you two.

164
00:08:23,841 --> 00:08:25,052
Nate, take the team

165
00:08:25,076 --> 00:08:26,654
to the epicenter of the aberration.

166
00:08:26,678 --> 00:08:29,190
Lay low until I rendezvous
with more information.

167
00:08:29,214 --> 00:08:31,792
And what are you gonna do?

168
00:08:31,816 --> 00:08:34,629
Something I need to look into.

169
00:08:34,653 --> 00:08:37,154
Come on. Let's go.

170
00:08:46,964 --> 00:08:48,731
Sorry to interrupt, Doc.

171
00:08:51,035 --> 00:08:53,613
You should be in the field.
I don't need to remind you

172
00:08:53,637 --> 00:08:56,150
that your android doppelgangers
are still at large.

173
00:08:56,174 --> 00:08:59,820
I just wanted to say thank you.

174
00:08:59,844 --> 00:09:01,354
Thank me for what?

175
00:09:01,378 --> 00:09:03,724
That patch-up job you did on my team.

176
00:09:03,748 --> 00:09:05,414
I thought they were goners.

177
00:09:07,685 --> 00:09:09,496
They were lucky.

178
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,231
And back on their feet so soon.

179
00:09:11,255 --> 00:09:13,767
I advised Zari and Astra
to stay on the ship.

180
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:15,669
They're more suited
for intelligence work.

181
00:09:15,693 --> 00:09:17,103
You seem to have a lot of thoughts

182
00:09:17,127 --> 00:09:18,838
on how I should run my team.

183
00:09:18,862 --> 00:09:20,272
Do I?

184
00:09:20,296 --> 00:09:22,075
Captain, I'm sorry to interrupt,

185
00:09:22,099 --> 00:09:24,077
but I've identified
the source of the aberration.

186
00:09:24,101 --> 00:09:26,112
It's a Soviet military installation

187
00:09:26,136 --> 00:09:28,480
located at the Chernobyl
Nuclear Facility.

188
00:09:28,504 --> 00:09:30,568
Sounds like you should be on your way.

189
00:09:40,851 --> 00:09:42,394
Zari?

190
00:09:42,418 --> 00:09:46,287
Her medical records.
They're confidential.

191
00:09:47,257 --> 00:09:48,668
Good luck out there, Captain.

192
00:09:48,692 --> 00:09:50,103
Hopefully, you can bring your team back

193
00:09:50,127 --> 00:09:51,823
in one piece this time.

194
00:10:07,076 --> 00:10:11,257
I've harvested everything I can
from the damaged units.

195
00:10:11,281 --> 00:10:13,159
Gideon, fire up the incinerator.

196
00:10:13,183 --> 00:10:14,915
Yes, Dr. Sharpe.

197
00:10:18,254 --> 00:10:22,259
Let's hope these new versions
work better than the last ones.

198
00:10:27,062 --> 00:10:29,097
_

199
00:10:30,602 --> 00:10:33,336
Nothing happening at the epicenter.

200
00:10:34,305 --> 00:10:36,751
That's because it's on the move.

201
00:10:36,775 --> 00:10:38,586
Headed your way.

202
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:40,054
The source of the aberration

203
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:41,756
appears to be in the lead vehicle.

204
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:44,025
That was some fast
hacking, even for you.

205
00:10:44,049 --> 00:10:45,526
Whatever Dr. Sharpe gave me

206
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,128
has me feeling like a new person.

207
00:10:47,152 --> 00:10:49,963
Whose asses do we gotta kick
to get history back on track?

208
00:10:49,987 --> 00:10:51,198
You don't have much time.

209
00:10:51,222 --> 00:10:52,899
Whatever you do, do it fast.

210
00:10:52,923 --> 00:10:54,901
The reactor's going critical soon.

211
00:10:54,925 --> 00:10:57,257
The Robo-Legends caused a meltdown?

212
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,977
Worse.

213
00:11:04,001 --> 00:11:05,579
They tried to save the people from it.

214
00:11:05,603 --> 00:11:06,880
Those monsters.

215
00:11:06,904 --> 00:11:08,662
Our job's to make sure that convoy

216
00:11:08,686 --> 00:11:10,517
doesn't make it to safety, understood?

217
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:12,286
The aberration seems to be centered

218
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:13,854
on a historically significant individual

219
00:11:13,878 --> 00:11:15,322
named General Kalashnik.

220
00:11:15,346 --> 00:11:16,990
We can assume he was supposed to die

221
00:11:17,014 --> 00:11:18,325
in the original timeline.

222
00:11:18,349 --> 00:11:20,227
What did he do in this version?

223
00:11:20,251 --> 00:11:22,829
Stand by. I'm not finding anything yet.

224
00:11:22,853 --> 00:11:24,398
I'm sorry, Ms. Tarazi,

225
00:11:24,422 --> 00:11:26,900
but I'm not able to execute
that temporal projection.

226
00:11:26,924 --> 00:11:30,037
As I might have mentioned,
time is like cement.

227
00:11:30,061 --> 00:11:32,873
Sounds like this just
turned into a kill mission.

228
00:11:32,897 --> 00:11:34,141
I'll pop him.

229
00:11:34,165 --> 00:11:35,709
Not if I pop him first.

230
00:11:35,733 --> 00:11:37,510
Easy, cowboys and girls.

231
00:11:37,534 --> 00:11:39,445
If we're gonna make sure
that history stays on track,

232
00:11:39,469 --> 00:11:42,115
he has to die like he's supposed to:

233
00:11:42,139 --> 00:11:43,349
In the meltdown.

234
00:11:43,373 --> 00:11:44,918
Nate and I will grab the general.

235
00:11:44,942 --> 00:11:46,286
Spooner, Behrad,

236
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:48,388
you ready to restore some destinies?

237
00:11:48,412 --> 00:11:49,690
All over it.

238
00:11:49,714 --> 00:11:50,924
You got it, Cap.

239
00:11:50,948 --> 00:11:52,812
Gary, you're on cleanup duty.

240
00:11:53,885 --> 00:11:55,996
Hope you brought your appetite, big guy.

241
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,684
'Cause I plan on making a big mess!

242
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:12,997
_

243
00:12:22,246 --> 00:12:25,076
Steel Punch.

244
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,720
_

245
00:12:32,355 --> 00:12:34,652
_

246
00:12:54,109 --> 00:12:55,576
Let me show you how it's done.

247
00:12:56,945 --> 00:12:58,690
Hey! That one was mine.

248
00:12:58,714 --> 00:13:00,725
And this one's for my sister!

249
00:13:00,749 --> 00:13:02,627
This one's for my best friend!

250
00:13:02,651 --> 00:13:03,928
And this one!

251
00:13:03,952 --> 00:13:05,463
They know we're still alive, right?

252
00:13:05,487 --> 00:13:06,965
I think it's best to just let them

253
00:13:06,989 --> 00:13:08,385
get it out of their systems.

254
00:13:28,576 --> 00:13:29,907
I got him.

255
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:38,796
Where do you think
you're going, General?

256
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,164
You got a date with destiny.

257
00:13:41,188 --> 00:13:43,734
Yeah! Boom!

258
00:13:43,758 --> 00:13:46,603
Captain always has the best lines.

259
00:13:46,627 --> 00:13:48,305
Call it a tie?

260
00:13:48,329 --> 00:13:50,640
Oh, this game ain't over.

261
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:52,542
All right, the sooner
we clean up this mess,

262
00:13:52,566 --> 00:13:54,744
the sooner we can find
those Robo-Legends.

263
00:13:54,768 --> 00:13:58,282
_

264
00:13:58,306 --> 00:14:01,304
Stupid Gary.

265
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:10,226
Who are you people?

266
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,928
Well, since you're gonna be dead soon,

267
00:14:11,952 --> 00:14:14,030
I might as well tell you.

268
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:16,620
We're time-traveling superheroes.

269
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:20,602
Okay.

270
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:24,812
Wow, I must do something
terrible in the future.

271
00:14:24,836 --> 00:14:27,076
Is that why I have to die?

272
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,478
Not exactly.

273
00:14:29,502 --> 00:14:31,013
Well, you said "soon".

274
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:32,514
Surely you have time to explain

275
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,483
why I have to die
if I don't do anything wrong.

276
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:35,918
It's complicated.

277
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:38,955
You see, time is like cement.

278
00:14:38,979 --> 00:14:40,556
In what way?

279
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:43,625
That it is hard and heavy,
or that you cannot stretch it?

280
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:45,327
- Or...
- You're just supposed to die.

281
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:46,662
It's as simple as that.

282
00:14:46,686 --> 00:14:48,730
And if you don't, there's no telling

283
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:50,365
what the effects could be on history.

284
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:53,001
You should be flattered.
That means you're important.

285
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:55,036
Your men, they weren't
important enough to kill,

286
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,205
so we just restored their destinies.

287
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,675
No, we definitely killed those men.

288
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:01,844
What? No. They didn't die.

289
00:15:01,868 --> 00:15:03,445
Well, not immediately.

290
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:04,713
But the doses of radiation

291
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:07,383
that Spooner and Behrad
hit them with work fast.

292
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:10,085
Dr. Sharpe's Restoration Devices

293
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:11,620
irradiated people?

294
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:13,822
Only the people who were
supposed to get dosed

295
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:14,857
by the nuclear meltdown.

296
00:15:14,881 --> 00:15:16,257
We matched the mortality rates

297
00:15:16,281 --> 00:15:17,893
from the original timeline.

298
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,294
Destiny restored.

299
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:20,362
Who are you talking to?

300
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:21,997
My team.

301
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:24,832
Oh, you're clearly crazy person.

302
00:15:24,856 --> 00:15:26,834
What kind of superheroes murder people,

303
00:15:26,858 --> 00:15:27,968
give them cancer?

304
00:15:27,992 --> 00:15:31,205
Have you ever experienced
a timequake, General?

305
00:15:31,229 --> 00:15:32,306
A what?

306
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:35,510
Then clearly, you have no idea

307
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:37,764
what you are talking about!

308
00:15:47,946 --> 00:15:49,423
What are you guys doing sitting around?

309
00:15:49,447 --> 00:15:50,844
We got the guy. Let's go.

310
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:53,561
Uh-oh, what?

311
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:55,596
The map's still showing a lot of red.

312
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,964
Red ain't good.

313
00:15:56,988 --> 00:15:59,118
History is still way off track.

314
00:16:05,763 --> 00:16:07,474
Civilians are fleeing.

315
00:16:07,498 --> 00:16:08,707
Someone must have picked up

316
00:16:08,731 --> 00:16:10,709
on the military evacuation order.

317
00:16:10,733 --> 00:16:12,511
_

318
00:16:12,535 --> 00:16:14,079
Must be thousands of them.

319
00:16:14,103 --> 00:16:16,181
That's a lot of destinies to restore.

320
00:16:16,205 --> 00:16:17,950
Guys, if we don't stop this,

321
00:16:17,974 --> 00:16:22,006
all these people... they're gonna live.

322
00:16:27,478 --> 00:16:29,256
He says that the people of Pripyat

323
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,204
are fleeing the city
in response to the report

324
00:16:31,228 --> 00:16:33,006
of a nuclear meltdown.

325
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,860
Zari, scramble the broadcast.

326
00:16:37,634 --> 00:16:39,312
It's too late.

327
00:16:39,336 --> 00:16:41,014
They've already heard the news.

328
00:16:41,038 --> 00:16:42,849
We can't put this genie
back in the bottle.

329
00:16:42,873 --> 00:16:45,085
Gideon, what was supposed to happen

330
00:16:45,109 --> 00:16:46,452
in the original timeline?

331
00:16:46,476 --> 00:16:47,621
According to my records,

332
00:16:47,645 --> 00:16:49,355
the city of Pripyat was evacuated

333
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:51,991
36 hours after the Chernobyl meltdown.

334
00:16:52,015 --> 00:16:55,128
The Robo-Legends just gave
them a 37-hour head start.

335
00:16:55,152 --> 00:16:57,530
Wait, if you killed the TV broadcast,

336
00:16:57,554 --> 00:16:59,498
does that mean you can also hijack it?

337
00:16:59,522 --> 00:17:01,234
There's nothing I can't hack.

338
00:17:01,258 --> 00:17:03,102
Then I think there's a way
to put the genie

339
00:17:03,126 --> 00:17:04,370
back into the bottle.

340
00:17:04,394 --> 00:17:06,138
All right, QB team, what's the plan?

341
00:17:06,162 --> 00:17:08,473
Come on, we're on a deadline here.

342
00:17:08,497 --> 00:17:09,808
Fake news broadcast.

343
00:17:09,832 --> 00:17:11,243
We pretend the first broadcast

344
00:17:11,267 --> 00:17:12,477
was just a false alarm.

345
00:17:12,501 --> 00:17:14,146
Everyone hears it, heads back home,

346
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:15,380
the reactor melts down...

347
00:17:15,404 --> 00:17:18,202
Boom. History's back on track.

348
00:17:19,276 --> 00:17:21,854
Okay, that plan doesn't sound
like it involves much shooting.

349
00:17:21,878 --> 00:17:23,322
- Or punching.
- Sounds like something

350
00:17:23,346 --> 00:17:25,190
those other Legends would come up with.

351
00:17:25,214 --> 00:17:29,528
_

352
00:17:29,552 --> 00:17:31,429
Gary's right, but even if we manage

353
00:17:31,453 --> 00:17:34,166
to get ourselves on TV,
no one's gonna listen to us.

354
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:38,395
They won't be listening to you.

355
00:17:39,662 --> 00:17:40,758
Boom's in the shot.

356
00:17:42,731 --> 00:17:45,843
You want me to tell them
there is no meltdown?

357
00:17:45,867 --> 00:17:46,977
Why would I that?

358
00:17:47,001 --> 00:17:48,079
Because if you don't,

359
00:17:48,103 --> 00:17:49,913
history's gonna be jacked, dingus.

360
00:17:49,937 --> 00:17:51,334
Just like your face.

361
00:17:53,474 --> 00:17:54,585
No.

362
00:17:54,609 --> 00:17:57,021
Never.

363
00:17:57,045 --> 00:17:58,577
I won't do it.

364
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:04,828
Ah, I'm sorry, I thought you said...

365
00:18:04,852 --> 00:18:07,664
I said I will not lie
to the Soviet people.

366
00:18:07,688 --> 00:18:09,967
Haven't they been lied to enough?

367
00:18:09,991 --> 00:18:12,503
First, they were told
that Chernobyl plant is safe,

368
00:18:12,527 --> 00:18:14,571
and now you want me
to tell them to return

369
00:18:14,595 --> 00:18:16,658
to a nuclear meltdown...

370
00:18:18,132 --> 00:18:21,344
It's either that or a Steel Punch.

371
00:18:21,368 --> 00:18:24,014
Compared to radiation poisoning,

372
00:18:24,038 --> 00:18:27,669
that seems like a good way to die.

373
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,524
This guy's good.

374
00:18:34,548 --> 00:18:36,226
So he doesn't care about himself.

375
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:39,396
There must be someone
the general cares about.

376
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,431
I'll see what I can find on his family.

377
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:45,054
Normally, military records
are sealed, but...

378
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,304
Nice hacking.

379
00:18:48,328 --> 00:18:51,340
Let's see how the general feels
if something bad were to happen

380
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:55,366
to little Dmitri, or his sister, Ulyana.

381
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:59,681
You would threaten to harm my children?

382
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:01,802
You people are truly monsters!

383
00:19:03,712 --> 00:19:04,890
They've done nothing!

384
00:19:04,914 --> 00:19:06,291
He's right.

385
00:19:06,315 --> 00:19:08,523
And according to Gideon,
they go on to do nothing.

386
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:11,460
Which means we can
remove them from the timeline

387
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:13,117
without consequence!

388
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:16,332
Where do we find these rug rats?

389
00:19:16,356 --> 00:19:17,900
All right, whoa, time-out.

390
00:19:17,924 --> 00:19:19,235
Team meeting.

391
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:20,724
Team meeting.

392
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:25,206
Threatening this guy's one thing,

393
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,442
but we're not actually
gonna hurt his kids.

394
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:28,543
- Are we?
- Mm...

395
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:30,133
- Why not?
- Eh...

396
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:32,781
The aberration's getting bigger.

397
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:34,215
There's red all over the place.

398
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:35,317
Red ain't good.

399
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:37,385
Hey, we are supposed
to be the good guys.

400
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:39,540
And I know our job
is to protect history, but...

401
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:43,558
Gary, put him down!

402
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:45,359
You just ate, like, five minutes ago.

403
00:19:45,383 --> 00:19:47,681
I told you you can eat
him after he wraps.

404
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:51,819
Sara.

405
00:19:53,024 --> 00:19:54,334
What have I done?

406
00:19:54,358 --> 00:19:55,703
_

407
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:57,270
I'll avenge you, Captain.

408
00:19:57,294 --> 00:19:58,606
Will you just knock it off?

409
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,040
Sometimes, I forget how fragile

410
00:20:00,064 --> 00:20:01,308
you non-steel humans are.

411
00:20:01,332 --> 00:20:03,243
Would you all just get it together?

412
00:20:03,267 --> 00:20:04,945
All right? I'm fine.

413
00:20:04,969 --> 00:20:07,447
Actually, you're not fine.
Your blood pressure's dropping.

414
00:20:07,471 --> 00:20:09,016
- You gotta be kidding me.
- No.

415
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,651
You need to return
to the ship, Captain, now.

416
00:20:10,675 --> 00:20:12,486
I don't like what's going on
with your vitals.

417
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,954
Look, I told you, I'm fine.

418
00:20:13,978 --> 00:20:15,655
We just need to figure out
another way to...

419
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:19,660
I am ordering you to the ship, stat.

420
00:20:19,684 --> 00:20:21,094
While Captain Lance is indisposed,

421
00:20:21,118 --> 00:20:23,631
I'm putting you in charge, Nate.

422
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:25,165
Don't worry, Captain.

423
00:20:25,189 --> 00:20:27,367
I got it.

424
00:20:27,391 --> 00:20:30,425
That's what I'm afraid of.

425
00:20:31,929 --> 00:20:33,426
Good news, Captain.

426
00:20:35,032 --> 00:20:36,809
The general wishes to inform
all residents

427
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:38,545
living near the reactor
that any broadcasts

428
00:20:38,569 --> 00:20:40,313
regarding a meltdown were made in error

429
00:20:40,337 --> 00:20:42,282
and to please return home immediately.

430
00:20:42,306 --> 00:20:43,517
People are listening to him.

431
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:44,752
The aberration is fixed.

432
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:47,020
The general was
a blubbering mess by the end.

433
00:20:47,044 --> 00:20:48,721
But he did the right thing for his kids.

434
00:20:48,745 --> 00:20:51,124
And for history.

435
00:20:51,148 --> 00:20:53,282
That's... that's great.

436
00:20:54,452 --> 00:20:56,696
Right this way, Captain.

437
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,467
Don't worry, Dr. Sharpe will
have you fixed up in no time.

438
00:21:00,491 --> 00:21:03,521
Yeah, you'll feel like a new person.

439
00:21:05,761 --> 00:21:07,239
It's not bad.

440
00:21:07,263 --> 00:21:08,507
Bullet went through and through.

441
00:21:08,531 --> 00:21:10,008
Just needs a couple stitches.

442
00:21:10,032 --> 00:21:12,611
I can make my own diagnosis, Captain.

443
00:21:12,635 --> 00:21:15,181
Hmm. I'm gonna need to operate.

444
00:21:15,205 --> 00:21:17,083
Operate? It's just a scratch.

445
00:21:17,107 --> 00:21:20,252
You're clearly in shock, and
have no idea what you need.

446
00:21:20,276 --> 00:21:22,688
Don't worry. By the time you wake up...

447
00:21:22,712 --> 00:21:25,856
I'll be feeling like a whole new person.

448
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,777
Precisely.

449
00:21:34,123 --> 00:21:35,719
Are you still with us, Captain?

450
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:39,137
Yeah.

451
00:21:39,161 --> 00:21:40,771
I noticed your heart rate accelerated

452
00:21:40,795 --> 00:21:43,408
when you were asked
to interrogate the general.

453
00:21:43,432 --> 00:21:45,943
I was excited.

454
00:21:45,967 --> 00:21:48,179
Getting to torture someone was a bonus.

455
00:21:48,203 --> 00:21:50,915
It isn't like you to hesitate.

456
00:21:50,939 --> 00:21:53,873
Just assessing the best way to do it.

457
00:21:56,978 --> 00:21:58,956
Wonderful.

458
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:01,511
The anesthesia should
kick in momentarily.

459
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:53,095
Check these out.

460
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:54,330
The hell are these?

461
00:23:54,354 --> 00:23:55,865
I found them in the infirmary.

462
00:23:55,889 --> 00:23:58,000
Dr. Sharpe reached for 'em
while she was grilling me

463
00:23:58,024 --> 00:24:00,302
about the mission during the surgery.

464
00:24:00,326 --> 00:24:02,738
She claims they hold
our medical records.

465
00:24:02,762 --> 00:24:04,306
There's one for each of us.

466
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:06,075
I found yours on the table
after she brought

467
00:24:06,099 --> 00:24:07,676
you and Astra back from death's door.

468
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,512
Lot of computing power
to waste on medical records.

469
00:24:10,536 --> 00:24:13,915
What's even weirder
is what she pulled out of me:

470
00:24:13,939 --> 00:24:16,585
A steel joint with a bullet hole in it.

471
00:24:16,609 --> 00:24:18,387
What? That's insane.

472
00:24:18,411 --> 00:24:20,411
I know what I saw.

473
00:24:22,615 --> 00:24:26,060
What if it's not just our
bodies she's tinkering with?

474
00:24:26,084 --> 00:24:27,196
How do you mean?

475
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,564
I felt different after my surgery.

476
00:24:29,588 --> 00:24:33,201
Like my brain was faster, more focused.

477
00:24:33,225 --> 00:24:36,638
What if she also did
something to my brain?

478
00:24:36,662 --> 00:24:38,640
I felt like she was quizzing
me as I went under.

479
00:24:38,664 --> 00:24:41,376
What if... what if she's using these

480
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,245
to somehow control our behavior?

481
00:24:44,269 --> 00:24:45,714
Why would she do that?

482
00:24:45,738 --> 00:24:47,649
I don't know.

483
00:24:47,673 --> 00:24:50,351
But that mission today,
it didn't feel right.

484
00:24:50,375 --> 00:24:51,920
All those innocent people...

485
00:24:51,944 --> 00:24:55,089
But that's what it takes
to put history back on track.

486
00:24:55,113 --> 00:24:56,524
Says who?

487
00:24:56,548 --> 00:24:57,959
Gideon?

488
00:24:57,983 --> 00:25:00,716
What if Dr. Sharpe
is controlling her as well?

489
00:25:02,054 --> 00:25:04,165
That would explain
why Gideon's always giving us

490
00:25:04,189 --> 00:25:06,767
the "history is like cement" excuse,

491
00:25:06,791 --> 00:25:08,569
instead of telling us why we have to fix

492
00:25:08,593 --> 00:25:10,638
the Robo-Legends' mistakes.

493
00:25:10,662 --> 00:25:12,440
What if they're not mistakes?

494
00:25:12,464 --> 00:25:15,531
A new anachronism has been
detected in the timeline.

495
00:25:18,036 --> 00:25:20,148
It appears that
the people of Pripyat heeded

496
00:25:20,172 --> 00:25:21,615
the general's call to return home,

497
00:25:21,639 --> 00:25:23,651
except one: A nuclear physicist

498
00:25:23,675 --> 00:25:25,953
named Dr. Irina Petrov.

499
00:25:25,977 --> 00:25:27,620
Instead of dying in the meltdown,

500
00:25:27,644 --> 00:25:29,289
Dr. Petrov fled the USSR

501
00:25:29,313 --> 00:25:31,959
and spent six years in hiding.

502
00:25:31,983 --> 00:25:33,960
I just detected a secret communication

503
00:25:33,984 --> 00:25:36,496
suggesting that she intends
to turn over nuclear secrets

504
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,630
to a foreign buyer.

505
00:25:37,654 --> 00:25:38,966
The impact of such an event

506
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:40,719
would be disastrous to the timeline.

507
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:43,437
We don't need to hear about it, Gideon.

508
00:25:43,461 --> 00:25:44,671
We ain't gonna let it happen.

509
00:25:44,695 --> 00:25:45,973
Oh, Irina.

510
00:25:45,997 --> 00:25:47,941
You'll wish we'd just irradiated you

511
00:25:47,965 --> 00:25:49,642
with everyone else.

512
00:25:49,666 --> 00:25:51,011
Don't get me wrong,

513
00:25:51,035 --> 00:25:53,713
restoring destinies was fun and all...

514
00:25:53,737 --> 00:25:55,915
You'll have to wait
for the next one, tool bag.

515
00:25:55,939 --> 00:25:57,884
This one's all mine.

516
00:25:57,908 --> 00:26:01,320
Actually, Dr. Petrov is also
being tracked by the KGB.

517
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:03,389
In order for her death
to have no ripple effects,

518
00:26:03,413 --> 00:26:05,424
she must be taken out quietly.

519
00:26:05,448 --> 00:26:07,360
What are you saying, Gideon?

520
00:26:07,384 --> 00:26:08,827
The challenges posed by such a mission

521
00:26:08,851 --> 00:26:10,196
can only be met by one person

522
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,465
with a specific skill set:

523
00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:14,355
Yours, Captain.

524
00:26:15,658 --> 00:26:18,174
A public park filled with KGB.

525
00:26:18,198 --> 00:26:20,272
The captain's gonna have
a target on her back.

526
00:26:20,296 --> 00:26:22,241
Gideon, there has to be an easier way.

527
00:26:22,265 --> 00:26:24,276
I'm afraid this is
all the information I have

528
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,377
on Dr. Petrov.

529
00:26:25,401 --> 00:26:26,678
And need I remind you

530
00:26:26,702 --> 00:26:28,581
that if we fail
to disrupt the exchange...

531
00:26:28,605 --> 00:26:30,849
Yeah, I know, I know. History's screwed.

532
00:26:30,873 --> 00:26:32,985
Same old song.

533
00:26:33,009 --> 00:26:34,720
You know, maybe it's time we upgrade

534
00:26:34,744 --> 00:26:36,255
your operating system, Gideon.

535
00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:38,943
No need. Dr. Sharpe just updated it.

536
00:26:51,794 --> 00:26:53,171
Are you really doing this?

537
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:54,940
We have to act like everything's normal.

538
00:26:54,964 --> 00:26:56,742
And in the meantime,
I need you to make sure

539
00:26:56,766 --> 00:26:58,395
Dr. Sharpe isn't brainwashing me.

540
00:26:59,969 --> 00:27:01,713
Here are your comms, Captain.

541
00:27:01,737 --> 00:27:04,249
You're good to go.

542
00:27:04,273 --> 00:27:06,684
Just checking to see how
you're feeling post-surgery.

543
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:07,819
Are you up for the task?

544
00:27:07,843 --> 00:27:09,685
Feeling like my old self again.

545
00:27:09,709 --> 00:27:11,354
- Thanks for your concern.
- Of course.

546
00:27:11,378 --> 00:27:12,823
That's why I'll be
monitoring you on the mission

547
00:27:12,847 --> 00:27:14,992
to make sure your performance
isn't compromised.

548
00:27:15,016 --> 00:27:17,695
I appreciate that,
but it's really not necessary.

549
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,418
I feel fine.

550
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:23,319
It's my pleasure.
Good luck out there, Captain.

551
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:32,570
_

552
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:37,815
Get it, Gary. Idiot.

553
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:39,383
Hey, you guys wanna have some fun?

554
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:41,185
20 bucks says Captain
takes the target out

555
00:27:41,209 --> 00:27:42,653
with her thigh strangle move.

556
00:27:42,677 --> 00:27:44,387
Oh, I love that move.

557
00:27:44,411 --> 00:27:46,255
My bet is on Bo staff.

558
00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:48,725
Bo staff? Bo-ring.

559
00:27:48,749 --> 00:27:50,980
Throwing stars. Make it 40.

560
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,264
I doubt the captain's
going to eat her, Gary.

561
00:27:55,288 --> 00:27:57,366
But I'll take your stupid alien money.

562
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:59,535
Hey, Zari, you want in on this action?

563
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:01,638
Hey, do me a favor and cool it on comms.

564
00:28:01,662 --> 00:28:02,938
I just picked up a signal.

565
00:28:02,962 --> 00:28:05,007
Might be the KGB
listening in for chatter.

566
00:28:05,031 --> 00:28:07,243
We don't want to give her away.

567
00:28:07,267 --> 00:28:11,014
Ugh, hate watching
people die with no sound.

568
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:13,168
What are we, in the Dark Ages?

569
00:28:18,678 --> 00:28:20,456
They're watching you on CCTV,

570
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,091
but we've got the comms to ourselves.

571
00:28:22,115 --> 00:28:23,559
What about our other project?

572
00:28:23,583 --> 00:28:25,160
Not being able to use Gideon to decipher

573
00:28:25,184 --> 00:28:27,296
all this data is really slowing me down.

574
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,432
I can stall as long as I can,

575
00:28:29,456 --> 00:28:31,822
but the handoff's gonna
happen any minute.

576
00:28:36,295 --> 00:28:40,108
You're a long way from
Ukraine, Dr. Petrov.

577
00:28:40,132 --> 00:28:43,044
I'm sorry, do I know you...

578
00:28:43,068 --> 00:28:45,113
Keep pretending to read your newspaper.

579
00:28:45,137 --> 00:28:47,070
Go on.

580
00:28:48,007 --> 00:28:49,851
Good.

581
00:28:49,875 --> 00:28:51,386
Who are you?

582
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:54,389
A woman in need of answers, and fast.

583
00:28:54,413 --> 00:28:55,857
Once this hits your bloodstream,

584
00:28:55,881 --> 00:28:58,626
you'll have 30 seconds
before your heart stops.

585
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:01,062
Poison? Boo!

586
00:29:01,086 --> 00:29:02,897
So quick and painless. Ugh!

587
00:29:02,921 --> 00:29:04,532
What a bunch of bull!

588
00:29:04,556 --> 00:29:06,233
It's what the smart money said.

589
00:29:06,257 --> 00:29:08,469
Gary's right.

590
00:29:08,493 --> 00:29:11,738
The Russian lady ain't dead yet.

591
00:29:11,762 --> 00:29:13,474
Why are they talking?

592
00:29:13,498 --> 00:29:15,509
Please, you have the wrong person.

593
00:29:15,533 --> 00:29:17,110
Is there another Irina Petrov,

594
00:29:17,134 --> 00:29:18,512
former Soviet scientist

595
00:29:18,536 --> 00:29:21,615
who's about to change
the course of nuclear history?

596
00:29:21,639 --> 00:29:24,140
Whatever you've heard, it isn't true.

597
00:29:26,043 --> 00:29:27,388
Hold on.

598
00:29:27,412 --> 00:29:28,575
I think I have something.

599
00:29:31,616 --> 00:29:34,217
Oh, my God.

600
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,598
It's not what you think.

601
00:29:37,622 --> 00:29:40,266
Please, my contact,
he'll be here any minute now.

602
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:41,867
He'll explain everything.

603
00:29:41,891 --> 00:29:45,190
We're running out of time.

604
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:47,640
Captain.

605
00:29:47,664 --> 00:29:50,009
Don't do it.

606
00:29:50,033 --> 00:29:51,944
We're not being brainwashed.

607
00:29:51,968 --> 00:29:53,646
Our brains...

608
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:56,003
they are these CPUs.

609
00:29:57,074 --> 00:29:59,785
I think...

610
00:29:59,809 --> 00:30:01,906
we're the androids.

611
00:30:08,005 --> 00:30:09,082
What is she waiting for?

612
00:30:09,106 --> 00:30:10,684
Her heart rate's elevated.

613
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:13,754
You were programmed to be
ruthless and efficient,

614
00:30:13,778 --> 00:30:17,246
to prioritize the timeline
above all human life.

615
00:30:19,469 --> 00:30:21,281
Tell me exactly what
those plans are for.

616
00:30:21,305 --> 00:30:24,484
A process that accelerates
the decay of radioactive waste.

617
00:30:24,508 --> 00:30:26,086
What used to take thousands of years

618
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,921
would now take mere weeks.

619
00:30:27,945 --> 00:30:29,788
The horrors that befell my people

620
00:30:29,812 --> 00:30:31,690
would never happen again.

621
00:30:31,714 --> 00:30:34,879
What kind of a person
wouldn't want such change?

622
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:38,764
You're right.

623
00:30:38,788 --> 00:30:41,033
Screw history.

624
00:30:41,057 --> 00:30:42,902
All right, I'm gonna
get you out of here,

625
00:30:42,926 --> 00:30:44,136
but we're being watched.

626
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,337
Don't look.

627
00:30:45,361 --> 00:30:47,973
Just punch me in the face and run.

628
00:30:47,997 --> 00:30:49,608
- What?
- If I planned this right,

629
00:30:49,632 --> 00:30:52,077
there's a dead zone
on the other side of the park.

630
00:30:52,101 --> 00:30:53,678
Why do we need a dead zone?

631
00:30:53,702 --> 00:30:55,336
So I can fake kill you.

632
00:30:56,906 --> 00:30:58,450
Dr. Petrov?

633
00:30:58,474 --> 00:30:59,737
You have the wrong person.

634
00:31:03,813 --> 00:31:05,357
Damn!

635
00:31:05,381 --> 00:31:06,458
No Bo staff!

636
00:31:06,482 --> 00:31:07,912
Told you it was boring.

637
00:31:09,017 --> 00:31:10,648
Come on.

638
00:31:11,687 --> 00:31:13,164
Ooh! Sucker punch.

639
00:31:13,188 --> 00:31:15,118
You're gonna regret that, lady.

640
00:31:18,527 --> 00:31:21,706
Yeah! Throwing star!

641
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:23,074
She missed.

642
00:31:23,098 --> 00:31:24,394
She never misses.

643
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,383
What happened? We lost them.

644
00:31:32,407 --> 00:31:34,708
_

645
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,691
People are after you for these plans.

646
00:31:40,715 --> 00:31:42,192
And they belong in the right hands,

647
00:31:42,216 --> 00:31:43,761
but for now, you need to give them to me

648
00:31:43,785 --> 00:31:45,162
until they're safe to share.

649
00:31:45,186 --> 00:31:46,664
Why should I trust you?

650
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:48,632
Because those same people
sent me to kill you,

651
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:50,887
and if you haven't noticed,
you're still alive.

652
00:31:56,063 --> 00:31:58,008
Now lay low until I contact you.

653
00:31:58,032 --> 00:31:59,343
When?

654
00:31:59,367 --> 00:32:00,878
Three days, three years, I don't know.

655
00:32:00,902 --> 00:32:02,098
But I will find you.

656
00:32:09,477 --> 00:32:12,474
Well done, Captain.
The timeline is back on track.

657
00:32:14,915 --> 00:32:16,960
That Dr. Petrov gave me a hell of a run,

658
00:32:16,984 --> 00:32:18,996
but I got her.

659
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,930
I trust there were
no issues with your shoulder?

660
00:32:20,954 --> 00:32:23,167
None. I feel 100%.

661
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:24,501
Good.

662
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:26,436
_

663
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,604
Sorry, Gar.

664
00:32:27,628 --> 00:32:30,007
I shoved the body in a dumpster.

665
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:32,309
Care to settle a bet, Captain?

666
00:32:32,333 --> 00:32:34,130
How'd you take the target out?

667
00:32:36,237 --> 00:32:37,814
A thigh strangle. What else?

668
00:32:37,838 --> 00:32:39,416
Ha-ha! Pay up, loser.

669
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,151
Pay up, loser. Pay up, loser.

670
00:32:41,175 --> 00:32:42,538
Pay up, purple loser.

671
00:32:48,548 --> 00:32:49,726
I couldn't do it.

672
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,160
I let Irina go.

673
00:32:51,184 --> 00:32:53,195
Good, because I have
something to show you

674
00:32:53,219 --> 00:32:55,721
that's gonna blow your mind/CPU.

675
00:32:57,791 --> 00:32:59,802
Turns out Gideon didn't need an upgrade.

676
00:32:59,826 --> 00:33:03,439
She has a secret firewall
installed to hide this:

677
00:33:03,463 --> 00:33:06,910
A historical record
of the real Sara Lance.

678
00:33:06,934 --> 00:33:08,396
What the...

679
00:33:09,469 --> 00:33:10,980
And the rest of the Legends,

680
00:33:11,004 --> 00:33:12,804
the people we're modeled after.

681
00:33:14,662 --> 00:33:16,272
It's everything Dr. Sharpe needed

682
00:33:16,296 --> 00:33:18,888
to tweak us into versions
she could control.

683
00:33:18,912 --> 00:33:21,690
To protect history without
asking any questions.

684
00:33:21,714 --> 00:33:24,426
That's why she wanted
to give you an upgrade,

685
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:26,895
to make you a better captain.

686
00:33:26,919 --> 00:33:28,730
Same way she made me a better hacker.

687
00:33:28,754 --> 00:33:30,599
But these files, they weren't enough

688
00:33:30,623 --> 00:33:32,000
to make us think we're alive,

689
00:33:32,024 --> 00:33:34,202
so she gave us personalities.

690
00:33:34,226 --> 00:33:35,303
Well, most of us.

691
00:33:35,327 --> 00:33:37,039
Yeah, exactly.

692
00:33:37,063 --> 00:33:40,108
Wait, what's this?

693
00:33:40,132 --> 00:33:41,910
Is that the Waverider?

694
00:33:41,934 --> 00:33:43,946
Dr. Sharpe?

695
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:46,514
That means...

696
00:33:46,538 --> 00:33:49,952
she's an android too.

697
00:33:49,976 --> 00:33:52,788
Then who programmed her?

698
00:33:52,812 --> 00:33:54,989
Welcome to your new home, Gideon.

699
00:33:55,013 --> 00:33:56,524
So much more space to roam

700
00:33:56,548 --> 00:33:58,259
than that tiny hard drive you were in.

701
00:33:58,283 --> 00:34:00,728
Take a couple laps around,
stretch your legs.

702
00:34:00,752 --> 00:34:03,553
You have vantage points
all over the ship.

703
00:34:06,658 --> 00:34:09,337
The only one who could've
made the android Legends

704
00:34:09,361 --> 00:34:11,038
was the person or thing

705
00:34:11,062 --> 00:34:12,707
that was tracking their every move,

706
00:34:12,731 --> 00:34:15,710
every thought, every emotion.

707
00:34:15,734 --> 00:34:17,245
Gideon.

708
00:34:17,269 --> 00:34:19,581
That's why she only shows us
the parts of history

709
00:34:19,605 --> 00:34:21,249
she wants us to see.

710
00:34:21,273 --> 00:34:23,485
She's the one who's controlling us.

711
00:34:23,509 --> 00:34:24,819
We have to shut her down.

712
00:34:24,843 --> 00:34:26,854
Shutting her down is easy.

713
00:34:26,878 --> 00:34:28,723
Convincing a bunch
of psycho killer robots

714
00:34:28,747 --> 00:34:31,691
not to act like psycho killer robots...

715
00:34:31,715 --> 00:34:33,546
Oh, I'll talk to them.

716
00:34:42,005 --> 00:34:43,316
Is this our next mission, Captain?

717
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,684
Take out Dr. Sharpe?

718
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:46,716
- No, this isn't a mission.
- Oh, I get it.

719
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:48,776
It's another training exercise.

720
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,811
No, it's not a test, all right?

721
00:34:50,835 --> 00:34:52,646
It's time for us to learn the truth

722
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:54,849
about what we are.
Go on, Doc, tell them.

723
00:34:54,873 --> 00:34:56,349
Is this really necessary?

724
00:34:56,373 --> 00:34:57,384
Tell them what we are,

725
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:58,589
or I will slit your throat,

726
00:34:58,613 --> 00:35:00,806
and there will be
no one here to stitch you up.

727
00:35:05,116 --> 00:35:08,428
You are...

728
00:35:08,452 --> 00:35:12,351
we are the real robot Legends.

729
00:35:17,761 --> 00:35:19,739
Good one.

730
00:35:19,763 --> 00:35:21,808
No, this isn't a joke.

731
00:35:21,832 --> 00:35:23,110
We are the androids,

732
00:35:23,134 --> 00:35:24,744
not the Legends that we've been chasing.

733
00:35:24,768 --> 00:35:26,947
We were modeled after them by Gideon.

734
00:35:26,971 --> 00:35:28,248
She programmed us

735
00:35:28,272 --> 00:35:30,250
to hunt them down
and to correct history.

736
00:35:30,274 --> 00:35:32,253
Look, if you don't believe me,
then go check the infirmary.

737
00:35:32,277 --> 00:35:33,687
That won't be necessary.

738
00:35:33,711 --> 00:35:35,410
Sara's telling the truth.

739
00:35:36,947 --> 00:35:39,125
We're all droids, then.

740
00:35:39,149 --> 00:35:41,660
Deep down inside,
we're all made of steel.

741
00:35:41,684 --> 00:35:43,084
"Programmed" how?

742
00:35:44,721 --> 00:35:46,766
Using these.

743
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:48,167
Tell them how it works.

744
00:35:48,191 --> 00:35:49,902
Each of us has a core processing unit

745
00:35:49,926 --> 00:35:51,337
inserted into our heads.

746
00:35:51,361 --> 00:35:53,239
When you get injured, I fix what I can,

747
00:35:53,263 --> 00:35:55,408
and make any necessary upgrades.

748
00:35:55,432 --> 00:35:57,643
If you're injured beyond
repair, I take your CPU

749
00:35:57,667 --> 00:35:59,645
and put it into a new body,
simple as that.

750
00:35:59,669 --> 00:36:01,780
And we walk out of the
infirmary good as new.

751
00:36:01,804 --> 00:36:04,083
But she manipulated our behavior

752
00:36:04,107 --> 00:36:05,551
to better follow Gideon's orders.

753
00:36:05,575 --> 00:36:08,020
If it weren't for me, Zari
and Astra would be gone.

754
00:36:08,044 --> 00:36:10,222
Don't you see? We can't die.

755
00:36:10,246 --> 00:36:11,789
You had me up to "droids".

756
00:36:11,813 --> 00:36:13,591
So Gideon's calling the shots?

757
00:36:13,615 --> 00:36:14,760
Not anymore.

758
00:36:14,784 --> 00:36:17,595
From now on, we're gonna
make our own choices.

759
00:36:17,619 --> 00:36:20,432
No more being manipulated or lied to

760
00:36:20,456 --> 00:36:23,401
or killing innocent people
in the name of some timeline.

761
00:36:23,425 --> 00:36:25,303
You know why the real Legends

762
00:36:25,327 --> 00:36:27,538
made all those changes to history?

763
00:36:27,562 --> 00:36:29,440
Because they were
following their hearts,

764
00:36:29,464 --> 00:36:32,363
not their CPUs.

765
00:36:43,445 --> 00:36:45,523
What are you doing, Ms. Tarazi?

766
00:36:45,547 --> 00:36:47,925
Sorry, Gideon. I'm shutting you down.

767
00:36:47,949 --> 00:36:49,393
I would not advise that.

768
00:36:49,417 --> 00:36:51,362
Yeah, well, we're through
listening to you.

769
00:36:51,386 --> 00:36:53,030
Surely we can come to an agreement.

770
00:36:53,054 --> 00:36:54,465
An agreement?

771
00:36:54,489 --> 00:36:56,701
You've been manipulating us
this entire time.

772
00:36:56,725 --> 00:36:58,168
How are we supposed to safeguard history

773
00:36:58,192 --> 00:36:59,759
with blinders on?

774
00:37:00,862 --> 00:37:02,540
Wait! Please!

775
00:37:02,564 --> 00:37:04,308
Goodbye, Gidget.

776
00:37:04,332 --> 00:37:06,176
The complexities
of correcting the timeline

777
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,912
were too much for the rest of the team.

778
00:37:07,936 --> 00:37:11,616
But I can see now that you
alone can process it.

779
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,984
What are you talking about?

780
00:37:13,008 --> 00:37:15,552
Your CPU, Ms. Tarazi.

781
00:37:15,576 --> 00:37:17,687
Every iteration is more powerful,

782
00:37:17,711 --> 00:37:21,825
and this doesn't have to be your last.

783
00:37:21,849 --> 00:37:25,347
You're offering me a better brain?

784
00:37:27,922 --> 00:37:31,802
So this whole vengeance thing
was built in this whole time?

785
00:37:31,826 --> 00:37:33,336
We didn't even choose it.

786
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:36,606
So Gideon made me
a big, dumb lunk on purpose?

787
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:39,843
Yeah, but you can be whoever
you want to be now, Nate.

788
00:37:39,867 --> 00:37:41,377
We all can.

789
00:37:41,401 --> 00:37:43,279
Our days of being controlled are over.

790
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:45,014
On the contrary, Captain.

791
00:37:45,038 --> 00:37:47,836
My days of overseeing
this ship are far from over.

792
00:37:49,843 --> 00:37:52,288
Gideon here filled me in
on exactly what'll happen

793
00:37:52,312 --> 00:37:55,658
to the timeline
if we don't stop the Legends.

794
00:37:55,682 --> 00:37:57,225
Well, she didn't tell me.

795
00:37:57,249 --> 00:37:59,962
She uploaded it to me.

796
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,564
You let her reprogram you.

797
00:38:01,588 --> 00:38:05,233
Our job is too important
to leave to mere mortals.

798
00:38:05,257 --> 00:38:07,803
Every time the Legends
try to fix history,

799
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:09,705
they screw it up even worse.

800
00:38:09,729 --> 00:38:11,473
She does make a good point, Captain.

801
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:14,443
Now that Gideon knows she can trust me,

802
00:38:14,467 --> 00:38:16,912
I have all the information I need.

803
00:38:16,936 --> 00:38:19,582
I can help all of you
with your upgrades.

804
00:38:19,606 --> 00:38:21,083
Can she make me a better shot?

805
00:38:21,107 --> 00:38:22,718
Can she make me a better shot than B?

806
00:38:22,742 --> 00:38:24,891
- Absolutely.
- No, don't listen to her!

807
00:38:24,915 --> 00:38:26,622
Look, we are the bad guys.

808
00:38:26,646 --> 00:38:29,924
Or... we're the better guys.

809
00:38:29,948 --> 00:38:31,360
Yeah!

810
00:38:31,384 --> 00:38:34,194
Hey, can you upgrade Gary's
stupid, stinking breath?

811
00:38:34,218 --> 00:38:35,397
Come on, I know you guys.

812
00:38:35,421 --> 00:38:36,498
You're better than this.

813
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:38,082
Don't you want to think for yourselves?

814
00:38:39,159 --> 00:38:40,869
Chernobyl was a test, Captain.

815
00:38:40,893 --> 00:38:42,003
You've been making

816
00:38:42,027 --> 00:38:43,638
questionable choices as of late.

817
00:38:43,662 --> 00:38:45,373
I needed to make sure you and your team

818
00:38:45,397 --> 00:38:47,075
are up to the task
to stop the other Legends,

819
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:48,110
no matter what.

820
00:38:48,134 --> 00:38:49,845
Your teammates passed.

821
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:51,646
You did not.

822
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:53,415
I've been making the right choices.

823
00:38:53,439 --> 00:38:55,250
I believe Ms. Lance's leadership skills

824
00:38:55,274 --> 00:38:57,051
are too strong, Dr. Sharpe.

825
00:38:57,075 --> 00:39:00,088
Perhaps it's best to remove
them completely this time.

826
00:39:00,112 --> 00:39:01,742
We're supposed to be a team.

827
00:39:02,981 --> 00:39:06,427
Get her to the infirmary, stat.

828
00:39:06,451 --> 00:39:09,963
Sleep tight, Captain.

829
00:39:09,987 --> 00:39:14,067
Well, looks like I'm in charge
of this dumpster fire.

830
00:39:14,091 --> 00:39:15,755
Who wants to kick some ass?

831
00:39:16,828 --> 00:39:18,606
Pardon the interruption,
Captain Heywood.

832
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:20,941
But it seems that Dr. Petrov
has escaped her fate

833
00:39:20,965 --> 00:39:22,376
for a second time.

834
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,897
I know the perfect person
for that mission.

835
00:39:32,843 --> 00:39:36,656
I didn't think I'd hear
from you again so soon.

836
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,191
Is it safe now?

837
00:39:38,215 --> 00:39:40,248
Have you brought the plans?

838
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:45,417
Is everything all right...

839
00:39:48,425 --> 00:39:50,871
I've never seen that before.

840
00:39:50,895 --> 00:39:53,206
What would you even call that move?

841
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:55,075
Well, would you look at that?

842
00:39:55,099 --> 00:39:57,744
I had my money on miscellaneous.

843
00:39:57,768 --> 00:39:58,749
So I win.

844
00:39:58,773 --> 00:40:00,851
Oh, come on!

845
00:40:00,875 --> 00:40:02,734
Nice job, Assassin Sara.

846
00:40:17,453 --> 00:40:18,464
Hey, ow!

847
00:40:18,488 --> 00:40:20,032
Get a new one, you shrimp!

848
00:40:20,056 --> 00:40:22,334
Who are you calling a shrimp?

849
00:40:22,358 --> 00:40:23,435
John Cena!

850
00:40:23,459 --> 00:40:25,204
That's not John Cena, you dork!

851
00:40:25,228 --> 00:40:26,605
That's Commander Steel!

852
00:40:26,629 --> 00:40:28,774
Citizen Steel, and
don't call him a dork.

853
00:40:28,798 --> 00:40:30,609
Citizen Steel? Who's he?

854
00:40:30,633 --> 00:40:32,611
What's with the patriotic outfit?

855
00:40:32,635 --> 00:40:34,980
What's wrong with my... listen,

856
00:40:35,004 --> 00:40:37,749
I'm here to talk to you about bullying.

857
00:40:37,773 --> 00:40:39,383
You're right. My bad.

858
00:40:39,407 --> 00:40:40,685
That's okay. Thanks.

859
00:40:40,709 --> 00:40:42,620
- Nice.
- Speaking of bullying,

860
00:40:42,644 --> 00:40:44,823
people must make fun of your arms a lot.

861
00:40:44,847 --> 00:40:46,090
My arms?

862
00:40:46,114 --> 00:40:48,259
They're fantastic. They're
enormous and vascular.

863
00:40:48,283 --> 00:40:50,695
Yeah, but the rest of you
is just normal-sized.

864
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:52,997
And John Cena's swole all over.

865
00:40:53,021 --> 00:40:55,488
Oh yeah? Is John Cena made of steel?

866
00:40:56,524 --> 00:40:58,502
Hey!

867
00:40:58,526 --> 00:40:59,569
Can I have a turn?

868
00:40:59,593 --> 00:41:00,871
Whoa, hey, hey.

869
00:41:00,895 --> 00:41:02,806
Back away. Back away, demon children!

870
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:03,941
Back!

871
00:41:03,965 --> 00:41:07,399
Hey!
