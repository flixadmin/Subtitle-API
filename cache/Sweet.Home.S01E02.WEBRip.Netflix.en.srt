ORIGINAL STORY SWEET HOME
BY CARNBY KIM AND YOUNGCHAN HWANG

2
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:09,861
CHA HYUN-SU, 19-YEAR OLD HIGH SCHOOLER
CURRENTLY REFUSING TO ATTEND SCHOOL

3
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:13,573
HIKIKOMORI WITH HISTORY OF
HABITUAL SELF-HARM

4
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:15,784
MOM
HYUN-SU, ARE YOU SURE YOU AREN'T COMING?

5
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,460
It'll be a good change of scenery.

6
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:29,506
You haven't been out of your room
in so long.

7
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,892
MOM
WE'RE LEAVING

8
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:42,811
RICE IS IN THE FREEZER.
MAKE SURE YOU EAT, OKAY?

9
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,314
Load ammunition.

10
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:53,822
How long is Hyun-su
going to behave like that?

11
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:57,200
Why didn't you do anything

12
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:59,744
to make sure he never got this way?

13
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:00,745
Dad.

14
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,580
It's not Mom's fault.

15
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:03,915
Why are you yelling at her?

16
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:05,208
Don't give me attitude.

17
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:08,586
This family's falling apart.

18
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:12,048
You're ridiculous. Since when do you care?

19
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,134
I don't know why I had any children.

20
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:16,344
They're never grateful for anything.

21
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:18,054
Stop. Both of you.

22
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,472
This is a family trip.

23
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:22,851
Don't be like that.

24
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,688
Sure.

25
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:28,857
It's all my fault.

26
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:32,777
Dad.

27
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:33,695
Dad!

28
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:44,747
Is that Hyun-su?
Where the hell have you been?

29
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,916
Don't be like that.
The poor boy must be devastated.

30
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,377
He looks like a mess.

31
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:53,840
Hyun-su.

32
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:58,553
I really didn't want to come outside.

33
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,892
But I couldn't believe it.

34
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:10,857
Only 30 million won.

35
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,234
You're basically telling me to die.

36
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:17,488
How am I supposed to get by with this?

37
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:21,242
How can I live on this
for the rest of my life?

38
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:24,287
What do you want me to do?

39
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,538
-Drag him out.
-Take him.

40
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,832
How can I live?

41
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:30,501
-What do you want me to do?
-Take him out.

42
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:32,128
Hurry.

43
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,726
How could he just leave him here
like this?

44
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,156
Why is he so cold?

45
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:14,087
TRENDING
MONSTER, STATE OF ALERT, NOSEBLEED

46
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,506
AUDITORY HALLUCINATION,
PANIC BUYING, SHELTER, CHAOS

47
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:21,636
TRENDING
MONSTER, STATE OF ALERT, NOSEBLEED

48
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:27,267
Hey, I'm on my way.

49
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,269
The elevator isn't working,
so I'll be late.

50
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,230
No, the elevator is out of order.

51
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:34,649
I'm not lying.

52
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:47,787
I can't hear anything.

53
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,539
Hello?

54
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:50,707
Oh, no!

55
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:27,201
Just go.

56
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:28,453
I'm resting.

57
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:07,700
I'm hungry…

58
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:14,832
It's you.

59
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:21,607
Thanks for your help.

60
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,110
LEE SU-UNG

61
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:25,069
Su-ung.

62
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:27,447
Someone had to do it.

63
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,586
AUGUST 15TH SATURDAY

64
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,421
There's no service, is there?

65
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:45,423
I'm checking his family's phone number.

66
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:46,632
I should let his family know.

67
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,599
SATURDAY, AUGUST 15

68
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,021
What are you doing?

69
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:02,940
They can't see him in person.
This is the least we can do.

70
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:05,109
It'd be better if his family
didn't see him like this.

71
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:08,070
No.

72
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:11,199
It wouldn't be.

73
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,966
Damn it, the motion sensor
isn't working either.

74
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:41,562
Why is it my fault?
It's not even my problem…

75
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:45,274
The world's just so fucked…

76
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,692
Excuse me.

77
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:49,070
That's how the world is.
What hell do I know?

78
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,281
-Excuse me.
-Why is it my fault…

79
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,117
It's not my fault, and now
they want to get rid of me?

80
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:01,958
I want to kill them all.

81
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:16,931
Manager Han.

82
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,311
Manager Han, that son of a bitch.

83
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,197
Manager Han!

84
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:49,964
Excuse me.

85
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:51,215
Ji-su.

86
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:52,967
Don't go near him.

87
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:55,052
He might kill you.

88
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,723
Watch out!

89
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:07,356
My daughter isn't back yet.

90
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:10,234
You can't block this.

91
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,612
If anything happens to Min-ju,
it's all your fault!

92
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,780
-Please calm down.
-Block it.

93
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:18,492
Please wait.

94
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,787
I said, wait.

95
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,459
She's here.

96
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,961
I'll go get her quickly.

97
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,880
Open it. Please?

98
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:32,923
No.

99
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:37,970
Who are you to say no?
Do you know who I am?

100
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:41,432
I can't let this place fall into danger.

101
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,353
Stop, please.

102
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:46,812
Please open it.

103
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:48,814
It's working.

104
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,660
What's going on?

105
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:01,827
EMERGENCY ALERT

106
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:02,953
Is it an epidemic?

107
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:07,249
That man said he was going to the hospital
this morning.

108
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,168
Did the hospital do a test?

109
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:11,921
It must be the radiation.

110
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:25,976
SUPERMARKET

111
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,916
THOSE WITH THE FOLLOWING SYMPTOMS
MUST BE QUARANTINED IMMEDIATELY

112
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:51,043
NOSEBLEEDS, BLACKOUTS,
OR SUDDEN AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR

113
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:54,588
7,800 WON
NEW MESSAGE

114
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,442
How come you're so calm?

115
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,028
I am extremely shocked
and nervous right now.

116
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:23,325
That man…

117
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,911
No, that thing…

118
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:29,749
Do you think it's dead?

119
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:32,668
Probably.

120
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:01,530
Let's all go home.

121
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,657
What are we doing sitting here?

122
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,076
Won't the rescue squad come?

123
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,496
Do you not see this?

124
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:09,705
We're all screwed.

125
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,208
Our country won't go down like this.

126
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,002
Right, Military Man?

127
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,588
Yes. You're right.

128
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:18,839
If you stay calm and wait--

129
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,008
I can wait at home!

130
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:23,719
There must be an emergency shelter nearby.

131
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,387
Where exactly?

132
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,514
If we drive--

133
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,307
The underground parking lot
is blocked, too.

134
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:36,106
We have to go up!

135
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,609
Does anyone live on the seventh floor?

136
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:40,444
Me.

137
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:44,698
Hey, we can go up together.

138
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,075
Wait a minute.

139
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:48,452
If you're going up, we should all go up.
Don't you agree?

140
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,079
Let us all go.

141
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,039
-All right.
-No.

142
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:55,000
Wait. We need to block the entrance first.

143
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,377
Let's wait and see--

144
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,963
You can block, or wait.
Do whatever you want.

145
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:00,714
I'm going up.

146
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,758
-Wait.
-You can't.

147
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:06,512
You punks!
Where do you think you're running away to?

148
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:08,430
You selfish cowards trying
to save yourselves.

149
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,308
You're just worried about your shop.

150
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,061
I can't believe you just said that.

151
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,355
Byeong-il. Come here.

152
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,357
Do you all want to get killed?

153
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,985
Come here. Now!

154
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:23,404
He's right.

155
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:26,031
If we open the entrance,
we'll all be dead.

156
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,619
Move aside. Now.

157
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,455
You don't know what's out there.

158
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,082
I won't move aside!

159
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:36,792
-Come on.
-Why are you doing this?

160
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,586
-Stop.
-Don't do this.

161
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:40,045
-Come on.
-Stop.

162
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:42,423
What's that?

163
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:44,425
-What's that noise?
-What's that?

164
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,766
-What is that?
-Move back.

165
00:14:58,355 --> 00:14:59,523
Jeez.

166
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:07,907
What are you looking at?

167
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,665
Is that a bite mark?

168
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:17,875
Stop right there!

169
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,335
Byeong-il.

170
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,962
Check him. Go and check him.

171
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:31,388
It's a bite. He's been bit!

172
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,682
Oh, goodness.

173
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:48,781
I got him!

174
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,242
You saw me, right?

175
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,788
Look at the bite mark on his shoulder.

176
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:59,083
I got him.

177
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,210
Bastard.

178
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,337
Zombie bastard.

179
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,883
It's all okay. It's fine.

180
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:54,972
8 HOURS LATER

181
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,195
It's not a disease.

182
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,363
It's a curse.

183
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,240
CRUCRU

184
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:18,537
IT'S NOT A DISEASE. IT'S A CURSE.

185
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,667
They complained of frequent nosebleeds…

186
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:24,918
…and auditory hallucinations.

187
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,212
The cause could not be determined.

188
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,465
They weren't from here originally.

189
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:33,469
They came here
because they showed symptoms.

190
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:37,264
They turned into miserable,
desperate beings.

191
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:39,099
Every prediction was wrong.

192
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:40,809
It suddenly begins one day

193
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,186
and it never stops.

194
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:44,813
I was consumed by it, too.

195
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,441
Humans will not be able to overcome this.

196
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:49,943
If you have symptoms,
kill yourself before it's too late

197
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:52,029
because being alive will harm others.

198
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:54,239
But if you decide to live to the end,

199
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,366
there's something you must know.

200
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,534
-That is…
-That is…

201
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,542
THERE IS NO INTERNET CONNECTION

202
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,254
REFRESH

203
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,132
Nothing's working.

204
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:24,770
Will it still be there?

205
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:30,442
RAMYEON

206
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:42,287
There's probably no one out there, right?

207
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,475
I can't see.

208
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:27,666
I can't see.

209
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,887
I can't see.

210
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:02,409
I heard you.

211
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:20,427
I…

212
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:24,973
can't see.

213
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:49,456
I can't see.

214
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:51,124
I can't…

215
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:56,672
We have to kill him.

216
00:20:59,007 --> 00:20:59,925
Kill him?

217
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,010
Yes, of course.

218
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:05,722
Can you do it?

219
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:09,726
Me?

220
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,228
You're the leader.

221
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,148
-I am.
-Yes.

222
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:17,484
He's still human, though.

223
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:19,111
Come on.

224
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:21,822
Seung-wan, have you ever seen a movie?

225
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:24,032
If you let the one who got bit live,
then everyone dies.

226
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,909
It's okay because it's self-defense.

227
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:28,328
Right, Seok-hyeon?

228
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,459
Won't he die of starvation
if we just leave him?

229
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,713
What if he gets hungry and eats everyone?

230
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:40,048
-We should do something.
-"We should do something."

231
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,300
Knock it off.

232
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,012
Seok-hyeon, you go in.

233
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:45,929
What?

234
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:48,348
Yes.

235
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:18,647
-Jae-heon, someone is in there.
-Three…

236
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,816
two, one…

237
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:23,652
Two…

238
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:25,404
-Do you think it's a person?
-One…

239
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:27,656
It's a person.

240
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:29,866
They're telling us the pass code.

241
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:35,205
Two, one, three, two…

242
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:17,622
Thank you.

243
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:20,500
I thought I was going to die.

244
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:23,253
-What happened--
-A burglar

245
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:25,839
came in.

246
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,974
How long have you been like this?

247
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,310
It's been a few days.

248
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:41,938
Did something happen outside?

249
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:45,275
I heard strange noises.

250
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:50,280
You should see for yourself.

251
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:55,660
Okay.

252
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:07,088
Wait.

253
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:28,026
I thought I better carry something, too.

254
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:38,787
Let's live together in one place
until the rescue squad comes.

255
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:40,539
It's safe to be together.

256
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,749
Where will all of us go?

257
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:44,042
The daycare center.

258
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:48,713
It's relatively safe
because it's far from the entrance.

259
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:49,965
It will also be better

260
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:52,425
to sleep there than here.

261
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:54,261
I won't allow it.

262
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,722
-No.
-Who are you to say no?

263
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:59,015
She's director of the daycare.

264
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:00,517
Scumbags.

265
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,060
Pieces of shit!

266
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:04,646
You ignored me when I begged.
You're shameless!

267
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:09,901
Your daughter probably
needs someone's help, too.

268
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:24,708
That's why I'm saying I'll go. Let me go.

269
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:27,210
You can do whatever you want
after I leave.

270
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:28,670
What about you?

271
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:29,921
Are you okay with dying?

272
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,675
Do you have a plan?

273
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,468
There's no internet or phone service.

274
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:37,095
How can you be sure where she is?

275
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:40,724
-Still--
-First, you have to live.

276
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:45,437
Otherwise you won't be able to find
or see your daughter.

277
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:54,070
Please calm down

278
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:56,323
and help us.

279
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:59,200
I'll be sure to help you later.

280
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,080
Do whatever you want.

281
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:12,464
This door is open.

282
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,349
I don't think you should see this.

283
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:43,536
NOW IT'S YOURS

284
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:49,709
Did he kill himself
because the world is doomed?

285
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:52,295
No, he's been dead for over a week.

286
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,506
How do you know?

287
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:59,052
It just seems like that, no?

288
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:17,612
AUGUST 25, TUESDAY
SUICIDE

289
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,072
Should I just kill myself now?

290
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:24,911
At least then

291
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:27,956
I'd die a human.

292
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:53,732
Dad, don't go. It's too dangerous.

293
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:54,858
Don't cry, Su-yeong.

294
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:58,194
Take good care of Yeong-su while I'm away.

295
00:28:58,278 --> 00:28:59,112
All right?

296
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:02,866
-Dad.
-Don't cry, Su-yeong.

297
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:05,034
Monsters might come if they hear us.

298
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,871
You know
I was in the special forces, right?

299
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:12,584
I'll come back with food.
Yeong-su, listen to your sister, okay?

300
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,044
Get out of there.

301
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:18,173
Get out of there!

302
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:22,927
-Dad!
-Dad!

303
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:25,597
Dad!

304
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:27,849
-Dad!
-Dad!

305
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:28,975
Dad!

306
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:33,938
Go away!

307
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:36,691
Go away, monster!

308
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:41,154
Go away!

309
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,364
Help us!

310
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:46,743
Help us!

311
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:49,204
Help us!

312
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,581
Please help us!

313
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:30,263
I…

314
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:39,606
THEY MIGHT COME IF THEY HEAR ANYTHING

315
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:44,611
THOSE THINGS DON'T DIE

316
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:57,790
Dad!

317
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:03,713
-Dad!
-Dad!

318
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:06,799
-Dad!
-Dad!

319
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:08,051
Dad!

320
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:13,389
DO YOU WANT TO SAVE THE KIDS?

321
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:19,604
DO YOU WANT TO SAVE THE KIDS?

322
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,702
IF YOU MAKE A CALL AND LEAVE THE PHONE ON

323
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,537
IT'LL MAKE A NOISE
WHEN A MONSTER IS NEAR YOU

324
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:40,708
EMERGENCY

325
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:46,172
COME WHEN YOUR MIND IS MADE UP

326
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:17,412
I think

327
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,082
I better stay home.

328
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:23,543
I think you should come with us.

329
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,005
No.

330
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:30,675
I don't want to burden you anymore.

331
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:33,594
I'll find my own way to survive.

332
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,346
-Still…
-Okay.

333
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:39,183
Take care of yourself.

334
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:52,989
Everyone has their own way of living.

335
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:56,200
I'll be fine.

336
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:00,121
Of course, I'll be fine.

337
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:04,959
What's wrong with him?

338
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,127
Salute!

339
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:10,173
We met in the elevator last time.

340
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:14,052
Right. I'm Lee Su-ung.

341
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:15,011
You live in Room 1305.

342
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:17,764
And you're in Room 308.

343
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,976
I live in Room 1009. I'm Son Hye-in.

344
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:23,936
Nice to meet you.

345
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:25,646
I'm Ryu Jae-hwan.

346
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:27,440
Does anyone have sunscreen?

347
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:28,858
What?

348
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:30,902
-I'll look for it.
-Okay.

349
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:32,361
You don't have to look for it.

350
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:34,155
Anyway, I'm No Byeong-il.

351
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:35,865
We're neighbors, but we've never…

352
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:37,158
Wait a minute.

353
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:39,702
You're not a familiar face.

354
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:41,662
Right.

355
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:44,332
She doesn't really talk.

356
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:45,875
Oh, I see.

357
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:48,169
You seem to know everything, ma'am.

358
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:51,964
Don't call me, "ma'am."
I'm sure I'm much younger than you.

359
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:54,383
Pardon? What makes you so sure?

360
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:56,302
Where is he?

361
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:58,137
-Oh my God.
-Where is he?

362
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,348
-Where is he?
-Who?

363
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,850
-Seok-hyeon, who are you looking for?
-That thug!

364
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,061
That thug did this to me!

365
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:07,396
Son of a bitch.

366
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:34,549
You go your way.

367
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:35,967
I'll go mine.

368
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,307
How do you feel?

369
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:46,144
Do you feel like biting into people
and tearing them apart?

370
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:48,813
Which floor are you going to?

371
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:52,441
It's okay between us. We killed together.

372
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:54,986
Shut the hell up or go downstairs.

373
00:35:57,155 --> 00:36:00,908
I don't want to.

374
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:05,663
It'd be freaking embarrassing
if I changed into something like that.

375
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:08,207
I'll kill you if you change.

376
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,459
Likewise.

377
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:16,883
I think this works for you.

378
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,181
Walk carefully.

379
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:47,997
I'm Han Du-sik.

380
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:49,707
And you are?

381
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,335
I'm Cha Hyun-su.

382
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:55,755
A slow speaker.

383
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:57,757
How

384
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,426
can I save the kids?

385
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:02,511
What do you mean by how?
You'll have to go.

386
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:12,855
Should I go?

387
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,449
I used to be a legend in Cheonggyecheon.

388
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:25,868
You know how you can get a tank made there

389
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:28,162
if you have a blueprint?

390
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:40,925
That means I can transform your stick
into something more useful.

391
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:46,013
-Give me that.
-Pardon?

392
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:49,600
Give me that stick.

393
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:52,103
Oh, the weapon.

394
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:23,092
Honey.

395
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:27,096
You didn't even notice I was gone.

396
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,349
Bring the eggs. Now!

397
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,107
Stupid bitch.

398
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,608
Jeez.

399
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:42,361
SUPERMARKET

400
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:44,488
Bite him.

401
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:46,866
Bite him hard.

402
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:56,417
It's done.

403
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:00,046
Hey.

404
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:02,340
CERTIFICATE OF MERIT
FIRST LIEUTENANT HAN DU-SIK

405
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:14,310
They still move around
with their heads chopped off.

406
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:15,561
A kitchen knife won't work.

407
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:17,063
But this will do.

408
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:21,233
Can I kill them with that?

409
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:24,612
No, you can't.

410
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:27,073
How do you know?

411
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:32,745
I just do. Avoid them at all costs.

412
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:35,539
If you come across them,
run for your life.

413
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:36,457
No.

414
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:39,460
Don't get caught in the first place.

415
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:46,509
Then please lend me that canon.

416
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:48,469
No.

417
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,764
It isn't stable,
so it can fire only a few shots.

418
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:54,725
I fired earlier.
I'll fire again if it breaks in.

419
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:58,312
The last shot is for me.

420
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,649
So I can go easy.

421
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:04,462
I can't see.

422
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:38,537
I found you.

423
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:50,090
Don't run…

424
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:13,614
Where are you?

425
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:08,228
Man, everything's melting already.

426
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:10,606
They'll all go to waste.

427
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:25,412
Hey, can't you see they're all going bad?

428
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:28,457
The power went out.
What do you want me to do?

429
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:30,876
How dare you talk back to me?

430
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,258
Well…

431
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:41,220
Can you be in the management office?

432
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:43,472
I need to check the electrical room.

433
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:46,392
I saw some places with lights on outside.

434
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,894
A blackout would affect
the whole district.

435
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,148
Only this building is experiencing issues.

436
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:55,526
I'll find out when
I go to the electrical room.

437
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:58,779
That's all the food we have,
so we have to hurry.

438
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:02,324
What? Hey, do you think this is all yours?

439
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:05,869
Don't be ridiculous.

440
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:07,996
We'll have nothing
if everything melts, anyway.

441
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,581
-Why don't we hand out--
-Be quiet!

442
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:12,251
I'll go.

443
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:16,463
Hey!

444
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:17,589
What are you doing?

445
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:19,133
Hey!

446
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:21,135
What are you doing?

447
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:22,970
You're stealing!

448
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:24,805
It's an emergency.

449
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:28,642
Hey!

450
00:45:30,602 --> 00:45:32,271
Hey! Why you…

451
00:45:32,771 --> 00:45:36,316
I can't believe the way these
punks are treating me, goddamn it.

452
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:38,694
Damn it.

453
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:44,074
This is all because you look down on me,
you bitch.

454
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:50,706
It was charging.

455
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:52,499
I don't know how long it'll last.

456
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:56,628
One more thing.

457
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:58,714
Be careful.

458
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:12,519
What do you do in this situation?

459
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:17,441
Isn't there a firefighters' manual?

460
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:21,403
We have to calm people down
and make them act collectively.

461
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:23,530
Food and drinking water must be secured.

462
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:25,449
And an escape route, as well.

463
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:26,700
Most importantly,

464
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:29,453
we need to understand the situation.

465
00:46:29,536 --> 00:46:30,913
What about the cameras?

466
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:38,128
They can only help so much,
since there's only a few of them.

467
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:42,257
-There must be recordings.
-We need a password.

468
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:45,010
The security guard must know it.

469
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:48,222
The building was blockaded…

470
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:50,349
Not to lock us in,

471
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,560
but to protect us?

472
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:07,157
Hey.

473
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:09,076
You shouldn't go there.

474
00:47:12,037 --> 00:47:13,205
Why not?

475
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:15,833
My dog's been barking like this.

476
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:17,501
I'll be careful.

477
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:20,087
What?

478
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:25,050
What's wrong? Are you scared?

479
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:27,135
Is something there?

480
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:29,096
Okay.

481
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:32,641
Su-yeong.

482
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:34,810
I'm scared.

483
00:47:36,728 --> 00:47:38,272
Su-yeong.

484
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:39,982
It's too dark in here.

485
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,651
It's okay.

486
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:44,403
We'll be fine.

487
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:46,363
Dad.

488
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:49,533
He'll be back soon.

489
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:09,761
Kids. I'm here to help you.

490
00:48:16,101 --> 00:48:16,935
Sir.

491
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:20,355
Please save our dad.

492
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:22,316
What?

493
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,568
Dad

494
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:27,946
fell down.

495
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:32,242
I know.

496
00:48:33,118 --> 00:48:34,494
Maybe he's still--

497
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:37,205
Nobody can survive a fall
from the 12th floor.

498
00:48:52,804 --> 00:48:55,724
There's a man on the 14th floor
with a lot of food.

499
00:48:58,185 --> 00:49:00,062
You're hungry, aren't you?

500
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:06,610
You won't stay here by yourselves,
will you?

501
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:16,036
We need to go into the hall
where monsters are running wild.

502
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:18,038
Are you ready?

503
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:23,835
How old are you guys?

504
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:29,424
I'm nine years old and my brother is six.

505
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:37,516
Those are perfect ages to fight monsters.

506
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:52,197
Don't worry.

507
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:55,033
I'll protect you.

508
00:50:08,463 --> 00:50:12,843
FIRE HYDRANT

509
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:07,272
Protect them?

510
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:12,319
Is that what you want?

511
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:24,414
Are you okay?

512
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:27,042
Get away from me.

513
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:29,753
Go!

514
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:39,513
Yes, you always liked to act cool
in front of the weak.

515
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:41,056
And then what happened?

516
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:44,810
It was my fault.

517
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:45,977
CHA HYUN-SU

518
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:50,065
Come out!

519
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:53,401
-It was my fault.
-It wasn't your fault.

520
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:54,945
Bastard!

521
00:51:55,028 --> 00:51:56,696
It was your fault!

522
00:52:00,742 --> 00:52:01,827
You're a sad case.

523
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:04,412
It was unfair.

524
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:09,417
Die.

525
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:20,554
Yes.

526
00:52:22,013 --> 00:52:23,181
It was unfair.

527
00:52:38,613 --> 00:52:40,198
