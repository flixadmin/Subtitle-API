1
00:42:06,274 --> 00:42:07,685
I know you.

2
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:12,402
You have been talking to the
Tattaglia family.. right?

3
00:42:13,406 --> 00:42:17,400
I think you and I can do business.

4
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:22,036
I need someone strong like you.

5
00:42:22,582 --> 00:42:25,370
I heard you are not happy...

6
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:28,034
with the Corleone family.

7
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:30,624
Want to join me?

8
00:42:31,841 --> 00:42:33,798
What's in it for me?

9
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:38,136
$50,000 to start with.

10
00:42:41,434 --> 00:42:42,674
Not bad!

11
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:45,886
Agreed?

12
01:37:14,203 --> 01:37:16,661
I kiss your hand, Don Tommasino.

13
01:37:22,420 --> 01:37:24,411
Why are you so far
from the house?

14
01:37:24,964 --> 01:37:27,581
You know I'm responsible to your
father for your life.

15
01:37:27,675 --> 01:37:29,040
The bodyguards are here.

16
01:37:29,886 --> 01:37:31,968
It's still dangerous...

17
01:37:32,263 --> 01:37:35,255
We've heard from Santino
in New York...

18
01:37:35,475 --> 01:37:37,762
Your enemies know you're here.

19
01:37:38,895 --> 01:37:42,058
Did Santino say when
I can go back?

20
01:37:42,315 --> 01:37:44,022
Not yet.

21
01:37:44,192 --> 01:37:46,058
It's out of the question.

22
01:37:49,405 --> 01:37:51,021
Where are you going <i>now?</i>

23
01:37:54,327 --> 01:37:55,408
Take my car.

24
01:37:58,831 --> 01:37:59,866
I want to walk.

25
01:38:02,752 --> 01:38:03,833
Be careful.

26
01:38:38,246 --> 01:38:39,486
Where have all the men gone?

27
01:38:40,540 --> 01:38:42,827
They're all dead from vendettas.

28
01:38:44,335 --> 01:38:46,827
There are the names of the dead.

29
01:39:35,052 --> 01:39:37,168
Mamma Mia what a beauty.

30
01:39:45,396 --> 01:39:48,479
I think you got hit
by the thunderbolt.

31
01:39:54,447 --> 01:39:58,441
In Sicily women are more
dangerous than shotguns.

32
01:40:22,308 --> 01:40:23,469
Did you have a good hunt?

33
01:40:24,477 --> 01:40:26,639
You know all the girls
around here?

34
01:40:27,313 --> 01:40:28,678
We saw some real beauties.

35
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:33,058
One of them struck our friend
like a thunderbolt.

36
01:40:36,405 --> 01:40:39,067
She would tempt the devil himself.

37
01:40:46,624 --> 01:40:48,831
Really put together.

38
01:40:53,756 --> 01:40:56,088
Such hair, such mouth!

39
01:40:58,010 --> 01:41:01,674
The girls around here are
beautiful... but virtuous.

40
01:41:01,806 --> 01:41:04,264
This one had a purple dress...

41
01:41:04,475 --> 01:41:06,637
And a purple ribbon in her hair.

42
01:41:07,478 --> 01:41:10,687
A type more Greek than Italian.

43
01:41:13,359 --> 01:41:14,599
Do you know her?

44
01:41:19,532 --> 01:41:22,274
There's no girl like that
in this town.

45
01:41:24,912 --> 01:41:26,152
My God, I understand!

46
01:41:30,293 --> 01:41:31,328
What's wrong?

47
01:41:33,546 --> 01:41:34,832
Let's go.

48
01:41:37,008 --> 01:41:38,373
It's his daughter.

49
01:41:38,676 --> 01:41:40,041
Tell him to come here.

50
01:41:43,514 --> 01:41:44,675
Call him.

51
01:42:04,744 --> 01:42:07,156
Fabrizio, you translate.

52
01:43:12,228 --> 01:43:16,267
<i>Come to my house Sunday morning.
My name is Vita“.</i>

53
01:43:21,654 --> 01:43:23,270
What's her name?

54
02:03:16,598 --> 02:03:19,886
It's safer to teach you English!

55
02:03:20,602 --> 02:03:21,842
I know English...

56
02:03:36,534 --> 02:03:38,525
How are things in Palermo?

57
02:03:44,626 --> 02:03:48,665
Michael is teaching me to
drive.. watch, I'll show you.

58
02:03:51,341 --> 02:03:53,127
How are things in Palermo?

59
02:03:53,676 --> 02:03:56,839
Young people don't respect
anything any more...

60
02:03:57,889 --> 02:04:01,098
times are changing for the worse.

61
02:04:03,436 --> 02:04:06,929
This place has become
too dangerous for you.

62
02:04:09,567 --> 02:04:14,858
I want you to move to a villa
near Siracusa.. right now.

63
02:04:20,870 --> 02:04:21,985
What's wrong?

64
02:04:22,914 --> 02:04:25,155
Bad news from America.

65
02:04:27,752 --> 02:04:31,461
Your brother, Santino,
they killed him.

66
02:04:37,929 --> 02:04:39,966
Let's go... you promised.

67
02:05:00,201 --> 02:05:01,487
Get the car.

68
02:05:18,302 --> 02:05:19,918
Calo, where is Apollonia?

69
02:05:20,930 --> 02:05:24,298
She's going to surprise you.
She wants to drive.

70
02:05:26,602 --> 02:05:28,718
She'll make a good American wife.

71
02:05:30,148 --> 02:05:32,810
Wait, I'll get the baggage.

72
02:05:45,121 --> 02:05:47,032
Where are you going?

73
02:05:48,499 --> 02:05:50,581
Wait there! I'll drive to you.
