9
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:59,300
I knew Harvey Dent.

10
00:01:00,675 --> 00:01:02,103
I was his friend.

11
00:01:04,155 --> 00:01:08,679
And it will be a very long time
before someone inspires us...

12
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,487
...The way he did.

13
00:01:12,555 --> 00:01:15,206
I believed in Harvey Dent.

14
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:37,520
- Dr. Pavel, I’m CIA.
- He wasn’t alone.

15
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,169
You don’t get to bring friends.

16
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:41,599
They are not my friends.

17
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:44,117
Don’t worry, no charge for them.

18
00:01:44,258 --> 00:01:45,980
And why would I want them?

19
00:01:46,184 --> 00:01:47,879
They were trying to grab your prize.

20
00:01:48,179 --> 00:01:52,166
They work for the mercenary
a Masked man.

21
00:01:53,045 --> 00:01:54,229
Bane?

22
00:01:55,428 --> 00:01:57,616
Get 'em on board.
I’ll call them in.

23
00:02:06,077 --> 00:02:08,945
The flight plan I just filed with the agency...

24
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:12,421
...Lists me, my men, Dr. Pavel here.

25
00:02:12,642 --> 00:02:15,087
But only one of you.

26
00:02:17,747 --> 00:02:19,651
The first one to talk...

27
00:02:19,852 --> 00:02:22,305
...get to stay on my aircraft!.

28
00:02:29,288 --> 00:02:32,749
Who paid you to grab Dr. Pavel?

29
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,030
I didn’t fly so good!

30
00:02:40,306 --> 00:02:42,097
Who wants to try next?!

31
00:02:43,698 --> 00:02:44,839
Tell me about Bane!

32
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,429
Why does he wear the mask?!

33
00:02:49,688 --> 00:02:52,138
A lot of loyalty for a hired gun!

34
00:02:52,265 --> 00:02:55,553
Or peraps he's wondering
why someone would shoot a man...

35
00:02:55,704 --> 00:02:59,311
...before throwing him out of the plane.

36
00:03:03,028 --> 00:03:05,997
At least you can talk.
Who are you?

37
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:08,600
It doesn't matter who we are.

38
00:03:09,172 --> 00:03:12,218
What matters is our plan.

39
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:21,918
No one cared who I was to like put on the mask.

40
00:03:22,518 --> 00:03:24,209
If I pull that off, will you die?

41
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,901
It would be extremely painful.

42
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,424
You’re a big guy.

43
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:29,889
For you.

44
00:03:33,483 --> 00:03:35,966
Was getting
caught part of your plan?

45
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:38,052
Of course.

46
00:03:42,253 --> 00:03:45,517
Dr. Pavel refused our offer in favor of yours.

47
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:47,708
We had to find out, what he told you.

48
00:03:47,785 --> 00:03:50,120
Nothing!... I said nothing!

49
00:04:02,795 --> 00:04:04,304
Well Congratulations!...

50
00:04:05,005 --> 00:04:06,713
...you got yourselves caught.

51
00:04:06,937 --> 00:04:07,538
Sir!

52
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:09,943
Now, what’s the next
step of your master plan?

53
00:04:10,643 --> 00:04:12,832
Crashing this plane...

54
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:19,706
...With no survivors.

55
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,875
Mayday!... Mayday...!

56
00:05:51,521 --> 00:05:52,083
No!

57
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,051
They expect one of us in the wreckage, brother.

58
00:05:56,326 --> 00:05:58,259
Have we started the fire?

59
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,523
Yes. The fire rises.

60
00:06:10,266 --> 00:06:14,068
Calm down, doctor.
Now this is not the time for fear.

61
00:06:14,637 --> 00:06:16,698
That comes later.

62
00:06:42,868 --> 00:06:46,699
Harvey Dent's Day.
May not be our oldest, public holiday...

63
00:06:46,793 --> 00:06:50,112
...but we’re here tonight because it’s
one of the most important.

64
00:06:50,207 --> 00:06:54,202
Harvey Dent’s uncompromising stand,
against organized crime.

65
00:06:54,396 --> 00:06:56,148
Have made Gotham a safer place...

66
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:58,556
...than it was at the time of his death,
Eight years ago.

67
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:01,641
This city,
has seen a historic turnaround.

68
00:07:02,148 --> 00:07:04,317
No city is without crime.

69
00:07:04,619 --> 00:07:06,733
But this city is without organized crime...

70
00:07:06,831 --> 00:07:09,128
...because the Dent act gave law
enforcement teeth...

71
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:11,126
...in it's fight against the mob.

72
00:07:11,429 --> 00:07:14,784
Now people are talking
about repealing the Dent act.

73
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,743
And to them I say...

74
00:07:17,144 --> 00:07:18,497
...not on my watch.

75
00:07:19,783 --> 00:07:22,165
I want to thank the Wayne Foundation
for hosting this event.

76
00:07:22,471 --> 00:07:24,851
And I’m told,
Mr. Wayne couldn’t be here tonight...

77
00:07:24,941 --> 00:07:26,710
...I’m sure he’s with us in spirit.

78
00:07:26,814 --> 00:07:29,569
And now,
I’m going to give way to an important voice.

79
00:07:29,767 --> 00:07:31,895
Ever lay eyes
on Wayne at one of these things?

80
00:07:32,088 --> 00:07:33,543
No one has. Not in years.

81
00:07:33,738 --> 00:07:37,761
<i>That people put their faith in a
murderous thug in a mask and a cape.</i>

82
00:07:38,256 --> 00:07:39,067
A thug...

83
00:07:39,854 --> 00:07:41,567
...who showed his true nature...

84
00:07:41,682 --> 00:07:44,371
...when he betrayed
the trust of this great man...

85
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:47,242
...and murdered him in cold blood.

86
00:07:47,671 --> 00:07:49,876
Sweetheart, what's so fast with the chow?

87
00:07:50,078 --> 00:07:50,878
Shrimp balls?

88
00:07:50,974 --> 00:07:51,714
<i>Jim Gordon...</i>

89
00:07:51,915 --> 00:07:53,072
- Thank you.
<i>- ...can tell you the truth...</i>

90
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:54,054
<i>About Harvey Dent.</i>

91
00:07:55,255 --> 00:07:58,174
Let him tell you himself.
Commissioner Gordon!

92
00:08:06,884 --> 00:08:09,213
The truth.

93
00:08:13,047 --> 00:08:17,341
I have written a speech.

94
00:08:18,783 --> 00:08:21,825
Telling the truth about Harvey Dent.

95
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,511
Maybe the time isn’t right.

96
00:08:32,107 --> 00:08:34,155
Maybe right now...

97
00:08:34,967 --> 00:08:37,879
...all you need to know is that there are...

98
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:42,536
...one thousand inmates in Blackgate prison
as a direct result of the Dent act.

99
00:08:42,734 --> 00:08:47,602
These are violent criminals, essential cogs
in the organized crime machine.

100
00:08:47,654 --> 00:08:53,096
Maybe for now, all I should say about,
the death of Harvey Dent’s is this...

101
00:08:56,783 --> 00:08:59,643
...it has not been for nothing.

102
00:09:00,367 --> 00:09:01,921
<i>Did you see the guy who owns the house?</i>

103
00:09:02,017 --> 00:09:04,206
No.. you know,
I heard he never leaves the east wing.

104
00:09:04,301 --> 00:09:07,635
You know, I heard he had an accident?.
Yeah, That he’s disfigured.

105
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:09,674
Mr. Till...

106
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:13,966
...why are your people using the main stair case?

107
00:09:14,677 --> 00:09:16,020
And where is, Mrs. Bolton?

108
00:09:17,908 --> 00:09:19,113
She’s up at the bar, Sir.
Can I help?

109
00:09:19,561 --> 00:09:22,496
The east drawing room.
Unlock the door,...

110
00:09:22,789 --> 00:09:25,237
...put the tray on the table,
Lock the door again.

111
00:09:25,567 --> 00:09:26,765
Nothing more.

112
00:09:30,012 --> 00:09:32,545
I’m sorry Miss. Tate,
I tried. But he won’t to see you.

113
00:09:32,841 --> 00:09:34,795
And you know,
you must not take it personally.

114
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:37,682
Everyone knows,
that Wayne’s hold up in there...

115
00:09:37,761 --> 00:09:40,476
...with eight inch nails,
paving into mason jars.

116
00:09:40,766 --> 00:09:43,375
It's very good of you to let me on the grounds.

117
00:09:55,485 --> 00:09:58,121
Why are you wasting your time...

118
00:09:58,122 --> 00:10:00,899
...trying talk to a man,
Who throw away your investment...

119
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:03,474
...on some Save-The-World vanity project?

120
00:10:03,775 --> 00:10:06,253
He can’t get your money back.
I can.

121
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:10,057
I could try explaining,
that the Save-The-World project...

122
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:11,474
...vain or not...

123
00:10:11,575 --> 00:10:14,175
...is worth investing in, Mr. Daggett.

124
00:10:14,298 --> 00:10:15,642
But you understand only money...

125
00:10:15,943 --> 00:10:20,900
...and the power you think it buys.
So why waste my time, indeed?

126
00:10:21,312 --> 00:10:22,671
Second shift reports in...

127
00:10:22,965 --> 00:10:24,891
You should spend
some more time with the mayor.

128
00:10:25,193 --> 00:10:26,395
That’s your department.

129
00:10:27,316 --> 00:10:29,218
Anyone shown him the crime stats?

130
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,047
He goes by his gut. And it...

131
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:32,878
...continues bother him no matter,
what the numbers.

132
00:10:32,978 --> 00:10:34,173
Must be popular with his wife.

133
00:10:34,473 --> 00:10:36,974
Not really.
He took the kids and moved to Cleveland.

134
00:10:37,074 --> 00:10:38,675
We have plenty of time for visits.

135
00:10:38,776 --> 00:10:40,962
The Mayor's going to
dumping him in the spring.

136
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:42,907
Really?

137
00:10:43,408 --> 00:10:44,344
But he’s a hero.

138
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:47,229
War hero.
This is peace time.

139
00:11:17,207 --> 00:11:18,831
Sorry. Sorry!

140
00:11:18,924 --> 00:11:21,257
I’m so terribly sorry, Mr. Wayne.

141
00:11:22,937 --> 00:11:25,419
It is Mr. Wayne, isn’t it?

142
00:11:26,257 --> 00:11:30,109
Although you, don’t have a long nails....

143
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:32,578
...or facial scars, Sir.

144
00:11:33,263 --> 00:11:35,420
That what they say about me?

145
00:11:35,932 --> 00:11:38,995
It’s just that no.
No one ever sees you.

146
00:11:39,303 --> 00:11:40,520
That’s a beautiful necklace.

147
00:11:40,722 --> 00:11:43,253
Reminds me of one
that belong to my mother.

148
00:11:43,361 --> 00:11:45,975
It can’t be the same one...

149
00:11:46,692 --> 00:11:50,504
...because her pearls are in this safe.

150
00:11:51,341 --> 00:11:56,159
The manufacturer clearly explained...

151
00:11:57,733 --> 00:11:59,287
...is uncrackable.

152
00:12:05,849 --> 00:12:09,050
Oops...
Nobody told me it was uncrackable.

153
00:12:09,196 --> 00:12:12,519
I’m afraid
I can’t let you take those.

154
00:12:13,419 --> 00:12:15,478
Look.
you wouldn't beat up a woman...

155
00:12:15,479 --> 00:12:17,831
...any more than I would beat up a cripple.

156
00:12:18,542 --> 00:12:21,956
Of course.
Sometimes exceptions have to be made.

157
00:12:27,302 --> 00:12:29,474
Good night, Mr. Wayne

158
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:47,387
- Can I have a ride?
- You read my mind!

159
00:12:47,885 --> 00:12:49,830
Let's go!

160
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:52,266
Ms. Tate was asking to see you again.

161
00:12:52,376 --> 00:12:55,569
- She's very persistent.
- And quite lovely.

162
00:12:55,598 --> 00:12:57,799
- In case you were wondering.
- I wasn't.

163
00:12:57,897 --> 00:13:00,643
- What are you doing?
- Examining print dust.

164
00:13:00,856 --> 00:13:02,416
We've been robbed.

165
00:13:02,493 --> 00:13:05,660
And this your idea of a sounding the alarm, is it?

166
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:07,874
She took pearls, tracking device and all.

167
00:13:07,973 --> 00:13:09,482
- She?
- One of the maids.

168
00:13:09,576 --> 00:13:11,387
Perhaps you should stop letting them
in this part of the house.

169
00:13:11,539 --> 00:13:15,026
Perhaps you should start learning
to make your own bed.

170
00:13:15,498 --> 00:13:21,203
- Why were you dusting for prints?
- I wasn't. She does.

171
00:13:24,748 --> 00:13:25,118
Sir!

172
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:28,443
The Congressman Gilly's wife been calling
in apparently The Congressman never made...

173
00:13:28,444 --> 00:13:31,004
...it home after the Wayne
Foundation event.

174
00:13:32,094 --> 00:13:33,810
That's the job for the police.

175
00:13:34,102 --> 00:13:36,528
When you and Dent clean up the
streets, you've cleaned them good.

176
00:13:36,831 --> 00:13:39,165
Pretty soon we will be chasing down an...

177
00:13:39,366 --> 00:13:41,471
...over due library books.

178
00:13:42,357 --> 00:13:45,051
And yet, here you're...

179
00:13:45,552 --> 00:13:47,169
...act like we're still at war.

180
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,787
- What's your name, son?
- Blake. Sir.

181
00:13:50,885 --> 00:13:54,585
You have something you
want to ask me officer Blake?

182
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:56,155
It's about that night.

183
00:13:56,556 --> 00:13:58,494
This night, eight years ago,
the night Dent died.

184
00:13:58,594 --> 00:14:01,002
The last confirm sighting of
The Batman.

185
00:14:01,108 --> 00:14:02,058
Who murders those people,...

186
00:14:02,859 --> 00:14:07,888
...takes down two SWAT teams, brakes
Dent's neck and then just vanishes.

187
00:14:08,196 --> 00:14:10,343
I'm not hearing the question.

188
00:14:10,737 --> 00:14:12,617
Don't you want to know who he was?

189
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:15,495
I know exactly who he was.

190
00:14:17,683 --> 00:14:19,121
He was The Batman.

191
00:14:21,993 --> 00:14:25,001
Let's go see about
The Congressman's wife.

192
00:14:33,568 --> 00:14:35,108
Master Wayne!

193
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:38,649
Master Wayne!

194
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,870
You haven't been down here in a long time.

195
00:15:11,964 --> 00:15:14,554
I'm trying to finding more
about our jewel thief.

196
00:15:14,668 --> 00:15:16,009
I ran her prints.

197
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:18,047
Unless she loss a lot of weight...

198
00:15:19,287 --> 00:15:22,762
...she was wearing someone else's
fingerprints. She's good.

199
00:15:22,871 --> 00:15:26,089
She may be.
but we have a trace on the necklace.

200
00:15:26,182 --> 00:15:29,068
We do, so I cross reference
the address she went back to...

201
00:15:29,165 --> 00:15:31,990
...with police data on high
end thieves and these...

202
00:15:32,113 --> 00:15:35,075
...and Selina Kyle.

203
00:15:35,376 --> 00:15:40,557
Database’s are full of close
calls and tips around the fences.

204
00:15:40,656 --> 00:15:44,469
She's good, but the ground
is shrinking beneath her feet.

205
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,240
We should send the police
before she fences her purposes.

206
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,652
She won't.
She likes it too much.

207
00:15:49,653 --> 00:15:51,568
And they weren't what she was after.

208
00:15:51,865 --> 00:15:53,945
- What was she after?
- My fingerprints.

209
00:15:54,052 --> 00:15:57,170
I was printer toner mixed with
graphite on the safe.

210
00:15:57,281 --> 00:15:59,873
It gives you good pull
and and it's untraceable.

211
00:15:59,971 --> 00:16:02,815
Fascinating. You two should
exchanging notes over coffee.

212
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:04,693
So you're trying to set me
up with a jewel thief?

213
00:16:04,996 --> 00:16:07,048
At this point, I'd set you up with a chimpanzee...

214
00:16:07,161 --> 00:16:09,552
...if it'd bring you back to the world.

215
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:12,090
There's nothing out there for me.

216
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:13,987
And that's the problem.

217
00:16:14,093 --> 00:16:16,636
You hung up your cape and your cover
but you didn't move on.

218
00:16:16,819 --> 00:16:19,475
You never went to find a life,
you'll find some how...

219
00:16:19,563 --> 00:16:20,548
Alfred.

220
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:23,685
I did find someone.

221
00:16:23,779 --> 00:16:27,052
I know, and you lost them.
But that's all part of living sir.

222
00:16:27,347 --> 00:16:31,247
But you're not living. You're just waiting.
Hoping things to go bad again.

223
00:16:31,695 --> 00:16:32,977
Remember when you left Gotham?

224
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:36,144
Before all this, before Batman,

225
00:16:37,435 --> 00:16:39,191
You've been gone for seven years.
Seven years...

226
00:16:39,392 --> 00:16:42,599
...I've waited,
hoping that you wouldn't come back.

227
00:16:42,977 --> 00:16:45,308
Every year, I took a holiday.

228
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:49,222
I went to Florence's cafe.
On the banks of the Arno.

229
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:52,696
Every fine evening, I'll sit there
and ordered a Fernet Branca.

230
00:16:53,273 --> 00:16:55,142
I had this fantasy.

231
00:16:56,586 --> 00:16:59,550
That I would look across the tables...

232
00:16:59,851 --> 00:17:01,654
...and I'll see you there.

233
00:17:02,149 --> 00:17:06,572
With a wife maybe a couple of kids.

234
00:17:07,391 --> 00:17:12,183
You wouldn't say anything to me,
Or me to you.

235
00:17:12,622 --> 00:17:14,451
But we both know...

236
00:17:15,129 --> 00:17:16,353
...that you made it.

237
00:17:17,354 --> 00:17:19,359
That you were happy.

238
00:17:21,721 --> 00:17:23,668
I never wanted you...

239
00:17:23,969 --> 00:17:25,922
...to come back to Gotham.

240
00:17:26,622 --> 00:17:28,568
I always know that there was nothing
here for you....

241
00:17:28,769 --> 00:17:31,019
...except pain and tragedy.

242
00:17:31,419 --> 00:17:34,819
And I wanted something more
for you than night.

243
00:17:39,106 --> 00:17:41,112
I still do.

244
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:47,315
It washed up here a couples of times a month.

245
00:17:47,614 --> 00:17:49,314
a more when it gets colder.

246
00:17:49,413 --> 00:17:51,308
Homeless sheltering in the tunnels.

247
00:17:53,001 --> 00:17:55,025
And we pulled him from
the base...

248
00:17:55,326 --> 00:17:57,003
...but other than that, we didn't touch it.

249
00:17:59,465 --> 00:18:00,360
What?

250
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:02,782
His name is Jimmy.
He's from St. Swithin's.

251
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,934
He's the boy on my group.

252
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:07,228
I coached the ball.

253
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,682
<i>Jimmy had not around for a months.</i>

254
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:12,501
No, why?

255
00:18:13,002 --> 00:18:15,295
Blake, you know why.
He aged out.

256
00:18:15,696 --> 00:18:18,502
We don't have the resources
to keep the boys on after 16.

257
00:18:18,601 --> 00:18:20,602
I thought the Wayne Foundation
gave money for them.

258
00:18:20,901 --> 00:18:22,402
Not for the past couple of years.

259
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:25,115
He has a brother here, doesn't he?

260
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:26,902
Mark. I'll tell him.

261
00:18:27,202 --> 00:18:30,001
I'd like to. If that's alright.

262
00:18:31,101 --> 00:18:33,202
You know, he was
doing down there in the tunnels?

263
00:18:33,501 --> 00:18:37,101
A lot of guys go in down in the
tunnels when they aged out.

264
00:18:39,377 --> 00:18:43,994
They said he lived down there.
They says there's work down there.

265
00:18:44,094 --> 00:18:45,298
Work?

266
00:18:45,798 --> 00:18:48,304
What kind of work you can find in the sewers?

267
00:18:48,604 --> 00:18:51,603
More than you can find out here I guess.

268
00:18:52,202 --> 00:18:54,988
- So you know about him.
- Of course.

269
00:18:56,387 --> 00:18:59,385
Do you think he's coming back?

270
00:19:00,466 --> 00:19:02,478
I don't know.

271
00:19:15,498 --> 00:19:17,295
You brought a date?

272
00:19:17,495 --> 00:19:20,997
I like someone around
to open doors for me.

273
00:19:21,297 --> 00:19:24,906
Right hand, I got partials.

274
00:19:28,511 --> 00:19:31,103
Very nice!

275
00:19:31,802 --> 00:19:33,490
Not so fast handsome.

276
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:36,301
You've got something for me?

277
00:19:37,001 --> 00:19:38,901
Oh yes.

278
00:19:48,016 --> 00:19:51,016
I don't know what you're planning
to do with Mr. Wayne's prints...

279
00:19:51,116 --> 00:19:54,717
...but, I'm guessing you need his thumb.

280
00:19:55,016 --> 00:19:57,140
You don't count so good huh?

281
00:19:57,441 --> 00:19:58,814
I count fine.

282
00:19:58,914 --> 00:20:02,613
In fact, I'm counting to 10 right now.

283
00:20:04,612 --> 00:20:05,919
Okay.

284
00:20:09,673 --> 00:20:12,772
My friend's outside,  just hit send.

285
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:25,758
This place is a little dim.

286
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:28,690
I'll light up in a minute.
Trust me.

287
00:20:30,381 --> 00:20:31,379
Is everything okay?

288
00:20:31,678 --> 00:20:33,971
Great. Catch you later.

289
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:42,662
It would've been a lot easier...

290
00:20:43,387 --> 00:20:44,991
...to just give me what we agreed.

291
00:20:45,367 --> 00:20:47,274
We can't have loose ends.

292
00:20:47,475 --> 00:20:51,677
And even in that dress,
no one going to miss you.

293
00:20:52,078 --> 00:20:52,900
No.

294
00:20:53,701 --> 00:20:55,281
But my friend over there...

295
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:58,872
Every cop in the city is missing him.

296
00:20:58,949 --> 00:21:03,324
That's cute! But they're not going
to be looking in a place like this.

297
00:21:03,405 --> 00:21:07,865
I don't know,
you did use your cell phone.

298
00:21:33,742 --> 00:21:36,334
Police!... Get down now!

299
00:21:41,738 --> 00:21:44,045
Help me!.. Help me!..
Help!

300
00:21:52,684 --> 00:21:54,917
Keep some pressure on that, Sweetheart.

301
00:21:57,713 --> 00:21:59,028
Call me?

302
00:22:02,335 --> 00:22:04,590
- Careful, Miss.
- He's bleeding. You gotta help him!

303
00:22:09,385 --> 00:22:10,784
I've got The Congressman.

304
00:22:39,597 --> 00:22:40,498
There!

305
00:22:45,096 --> 00:22:49,184
The manhole! Get this out.
Get the GWPD down here!

306
00:22:49,929 --> 00:22:51,644
You three!... down with me!

307
00:22:51,725 --> 00:22:55,599
You two!... you go down!
Cover the next exit!

308
00:23:11,714 --> 00:23:13,883
What? He went down there?

309
00:23:44,505 --> 00:23:45,766
We're going down there, right?

310
00:23:45,967 --> 00:23:47,519
That was a gas explosion, kid.

311
00:23:47,654 --> 00:23:48,829
What gas? It's a sewer.

312
00:23:49,138 --> 00:23:51,181
No one goes in there until
we know what's down there.

313
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:53,126
We know who's there Sir,
a police commissioner.

314
00:23:53,225 --> 00:23:55,177
Someone get this hot head out of here.

315
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:58,476
And where's that G.W.P guy?

316
00:24:40,278 --> 00:24:42,714
Why are you here?

317
00:24:43,706 --> 00:24:45,568
Answer him!

318
00:24:47,106 --> 00:24:49,556
I was asking you.

319
00:24:49,666 --> 00:24:51,448
It's a Police Commissioner.

320
00:24:54,891 --> 00:24:57,207
And you brought him down here?

321
00:24:58,156 --> 00:24:59,327
We didn't know what to do.

322
00:24:59,502 --> 00:25:01,151
- We just thought...
- You panicked.

323
00:25:01,281 --> 00:25:03,949
And your weakness cost the lives
of three others.

324
00:25:04,274 --> 00:25:05,670
No. He's a little...

325
00:25:09,431 --> 00:25:12,830
Search him, then I'll kill you.

326
00:25:41,767 --> 00:25:42,819
He's dead.

327
00:25:43,329 --> 00:25:45,109
So show me his body!

328
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,399
The water runs to any one of the out flows.

329
00:25:47,524 --> 00:25:49,486
We'll never find him.

330
00:25:54,363 --> 00:25:55,719
Follow him.

331
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,329
Follow him?

332
00:26:12,579 --> 00:26:17,248
Detective! Detective!
Hey!... Hey!... You awake?

333
00:26:22,904 --> 00:26:24,103
I need to see Bruce Wayne.

334
00:26:24,403 --> 00:26:26,904
I'm sorry, Mr. Wayne doesn't
take unscheduled calls...

335
00:26:27,103 --> 00:26:29,004
...even from a police officer.

336
00:26:29,303 --> 00:26:32,804
If I go get a warrant for the
investigation of Harvey Dent's murder...

337
00:26:32,904 --> 00:26:35,604
...it still counts as an unscheduled?

338
00:26:39,461 --> 00:26:41,926
How can I do for you officer?

339
00:26:42,005 --> 00:26:44,680
Commissioner Gordon been shot.

340
00:26:46,307 --> 00:26:48,356
He chased a gun man down in the sewers.

341
00:26:48,561 --> 00:26:51,809
When I pulled him out, he was
babbling about an underground army.

342
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,569
A masked man called Bane.

343
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,972
Shouldn't you be telling this to
your superiors officers about this?

344
00:26:57,070 --> 00:27:00,413
They asked if he saw any giant alligators.

345
00:27:00,722 --> 00:27:02,403
He needs you.

346
00:27:03,934 --> 00:27:05,690
He needs The Batman.

347
00:27:07,007 --> 00:27:08,648
Commissioner Gordon, thanks...

348
00:27:08,649 --> 00:27:11,028
He doesn’t know or care who you are.

349
00:27:11,442 --> 00:27:14,153
But we have met before.

350
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:19,397
There was a long ago,
I was a kid at St. Swithin's...

351
00:27:19,565 --> 00:27:21,776
...used to be funded by
The Wayne Foundation.

352
00:27:21,877 --> 00:27:23,031
It's an orphanage.

353
00:27:24,127 --> 00:27:28,327
My mommy died when I was small in a car accident.
But I don't remember it.

354
00:27:30,107 --> 00:27:34,020
My dad got shot a couple of years later
for a gambling debt.

355
00:27:34,457 --> 00:27:38,254
And when I remember that one,
Just fine.

356
00:27:38,892 --> 00:27:41,948
Not a lot of people knows what it feels like, do they?

357
00:27:42,649 --> 00:27:45,765
Be angry in your bones.

358
00:27:49,013 --> 00:27:53,248
I mean they understand.
The fosters parents.

359
00:27:53,249 --> 00:27:55,642
Everybody understands...

360
00:27:55,772 --> 00:27:57,126
...For a while.

361
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:01,926
Then they want the angry little kid
to do something he knows he can't do...

362
00:28:02,336 --> 00:28:03,800
...move on.

363
00:28:04,211 --> 00:28:06,298
After a while they stop understanding.

364
00:28:06,422 --> 00:28:08,187
They send the angry little
kid to a boy's school.

365
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:10,011
I figured it out too late.

366
00:28:10,124 --> 00:28:12,845
You got to learn to hide the anger...

367
00:28:13,246 --> 00:28:16,019
...practice smiling in the mirror.

368
00:28:16,718 --> 00:28:19,484
It's like putting on a mask.

369
00:28:19,667 --> 00:28:23,116
So you show up this one day.
In a cool car...

370
00:28:23,417 --> 00:28:25,632
...pretty girl in your arms.

371
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:31,579
You were so excited!
Bruce Wayne, billionaire orphan?

372
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:35,008
We used to make up stories about you man.
Legends.

373
00:28:35,314 --> 00:28:39,032
And you know the other kids,
that's all it was, it's just stories.

374
00:28:40,878 --> 00:28:43,998
But when I saw you,
I knew who you really were.

375
00:28:44,715 --> 00:28:47,780
I seen that look on your face before.

376
00:28:48,474 --> 00:28:51,627
It's the same one
that I taught myself.

377
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:55,717
I don't know why you took the fault of
Dent's murder.

378
00:28:55,961 --> 00:28:58,912
But I'm still a believe in The Batman.

379
00:28:59,206 --> 00:29:01,092
Even if you're not.

380
00:29:03,514 --> 00:29:05,938
Why did you say that
your boy's home

381
00:29:05,939 --> 00:29:08,756
used to be funded by
The Wayne Foundation?

382
00:29:08,818 --> 00:29:10,304
Because the money stopped.

383
00:29:10,692 --> 00:29:12,655
Might be time to get some fresh air...

384
00:29:12,656 --> 00:29:15,354
...start paying attention of the details.

385
00:29:15,735 --> 00:29:18,562
Some of details might need your help.

386
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:21,286
Have you checked that name, Bane?

387
00:29:21,598 --> 00:29:23,880
He’s a mercenary.
No other known name.

388
00:29:24,006 --> 00:29:26,825
He and his man were
behind a coup in West Africa.

389
00:29:26,917 --> 00:29:31,907
They've secured a mining operations
for our friend, John Daggett.

390
00:29:32,047 --> 00:29:34,876
- And Daggett brought them here.
- So it seems.

391
00:29:36,821 --> 00:29:39,535
- I'll keep digging.
- Yeah.

392
00:29:40,138 --> 00:29:46,254
Alfred, why did The Wayne Foundation
stopped funding the boy's home in the city?

393
00:29:46,455 --> 00:29:48,899
The foundation is funded...

394
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,642
...by the profits of Wayne Enterprises.

395
00:29:51,941 --> 00:29:53,344
There have to be some.

396
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:55,871
Time to talk to Mr. Fox,
I think.

397
00:29:56,174 --> 00:29:57,671
I'll get him on the phone.

398
00:29:57,772 --> 00:30:01,157
No.. No.. No.. No.
Did we still have any car around the place?

399
00:30:01,376 --> 00:30:03,101
Yes, one or two?

400
00:30:03,493 --> 00:30:05,609
I need an appointment at a hospital for my leg.

401
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:09,188
- Which hospital?
- Which ever one Jim Gordon's in.

402
00:30:12,834 --> 00:30:15,051
I've seen worst cartilage in knees.

403
00:30:15,131 --> 00:30:16,256
- It's a good?
- No.

404
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:18,760
That's because there's no cartilage in your knee...

405
00:30:18,961 --> 00:30:21,978
...and not much of any use in
your elbows or your shoulders.

406
00:30:22,071 --> 00:30:24,261
Between that and scar tissue on your kidney...

407
00:30:24,462 --> 00:30:26,657
...residual concussive damage to
your brain tissue...

408
00:30:27,065 --> 00:30:29,489
...and the general scarred over
quality of your body...

409
00:30:29,727 --> 00:30:32,027
...I cannot recommend you to go
heli-skiing, Mr. Wayne.

410
00:30:32,238 --> 00:30:33,709
Right.

411
00:30:48,284 --> 00:30:50,133
We were in this together.

412
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:54,616
Then you were gone.

413
00:30:54,879 --> 00:30:58,188
The Batman wasn't needed anymore.
We won...

414
00:30:58,288 --> 00:31:00,703
We strung a lie.

415
00:31:01,603 --> 00:31:07,702
Now there's evil rises again
where we try to bury him.

416
00:31:07,802 --> 00:31:12,002
The Batman has to come back.

417
00:31:12,502 --> 00:31:15,103
And if he doesn't exist anymore?

418
00:31:15,202 --> 00:31:16,690
He must.

419
00:31:33,088 --> 00:31:34,184
<i> You got them wallet, do you? </i>

420
00:31:34,484 --> 00:31:35,877
You took my wallet!

421
00:31:36,078 --> 00:31:37,291
No I didn't!

422
00:31:38,088 --> 00:31:38,630
Get out.

423
00:31:38,735 --> 00:31:39,390
She took my...

424
00:31:39,715 --> 00:31:40,315
Arghh

425
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:41,711
Now.

426
00:31:42,431 --> 00:31:43,310
Crazy!

427
00:31:43,694 --> 00:31:45,673
I don't know why he's so upset about.
It's only 60 bucks in here.

428
00:31:46,069 --> 00:31:47,306
You got to wear the watch.

429
00:32:02,932 --> 00:32:03,708
Who's that?

430
00:32:03,709 --> 00:32:06,739
Another stiff convety climb out of his sport car.

431
00:32:06,816 --> 00:32:07,546
Well that's Bruce Wayne!

432
00:32:07,958 --> 00:32:10,232
Mr. Wayne, over here!

433
00:32:14,215 --> 00:32:15,937
- I'm not sure if my assistant put me on...
- Right through here, Mr. Wayne

434
00:32:16,202 --> 00:32:17,856
Thank you so much.

435
00:32:23,098 --> 00:32:27,426
Bruce Wayne at a charity ball?

436
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:29,897
Miss. Tate, isn't it?

437
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:33,936
Even before you became a recluse,
you never came to these things.

438
00:32:34,294 --> 00:32:37,168
Proceeds goes to big fat spread.
This is not about charity.

439
00:32:37,566 --> 00:32:42,239
It's about feeding the ego which
ever society hag laid this on.

440
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:45,310
Actually this is my party, Mr. Wayne.

441
00:32:47,041 --> 00:32:52,744
And the proceeds will go where they should,
because I paid for the big fat spread myself.

442
00:32:52,942 --> 00:32:54,114
You spread generously?

443
00:32:54,506 --> 00:32:57,848
You have to invest if you want
to restore balance to the world.

444
00:32:58,493 --> 00:33:00,225
Take our clean energy project.

445
00:33:00,833 --> 00:33:03,486
Sometimes, the investments
just doesn't pay off.

446
00:33:04,545 --> 00:33:05,103
I'm sorry.

447
00:33:05,194 --> 00:33:07,801
You have a practiced apathy, Mr. Wayne.

448
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:11,141
But a man who does not care about the world
doesn’t spend half his fortune...

449
00:33:11,236 --> 00:33:13,390
...on a plan to save it.

450
00:33:13,852 --> 00:33:16,831
And isn’t so wounded when it fails...

451
00:33:17,632 --> 00:33:20,209
...but he goes into hiding.

452
00:33:20,674 --> 00:33:23,296
Have a good evening, Mr. Wayne.

453
00:33:26,689 --> 00:33:28,600
Mind if I cut in?

454
00:33:29,639 --> 00:33:30,823
Thank you.

455
00:33:33,721 --> 00:33:35,644
You're don't seem happy to see me.

456
00:33:35,719 --> 00:33:39,184
- You're suppose to be a shut-in.
- I felt like some fresh air.

457
00:33:40,322 --> 00:33:41,583
Why didn't you called the police?

458
00:33:42,092 --> 00:33:45,359
I have a powerful friend
who deals with things like this.

459
00:33:45,463 --> 00:33:49,920
It's a brazing costume for a cat burglar.

460
00:33:50,313 --> 00:33:55,637
- Yeah? Who are you pretending to be?
- Bruce Wayne, eccentric billionaire.

461
00:33:56,085 --> 00:33:58,662
- Who's your date?
- His wife is in Ibiza.

462
00:33:58,769 --> 00:34:02,563
She left her diamonds behind
though, worried it might get stolen.

463
00:34:02,856 --> 00:34:04,917
It pronounced 'Ibitha'.

464
00:34:05,086 --> 00:34:09,175
You wouldn't want any of these folks realizing
you're a crook now. Social planner.

465
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:12,982
You think I care what everyone
in this rooms thinks of me?

466
00:34:13,778 --> 00:34:16,587
I doubt you care anyone in
any room who thinks of you.

467
00:34:16,676 --> 00:34:20,562
Don't candescent, Mr. Wayne.
You don't know me a thing about me.

468
00:34:20,689 --> 00:34:22,604
Well Selina Kyle.

469
00:34:23,025 --> 00:34:25,208
I know you came here from
your walk-out Old Town...

470
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:26,933
...a modest place for a master jewel thief.

471
00:34:27,229 --> 00:34:30,208
Which means that either you're saving
for retirement or...

472
00:34:31,292 --> 00:34:33,334
...you in deep with the wrong people.

473
00:34:34,718 --> 00:34:38,983
You don't to get judge just because you
were born the master bedroom of Wayne....

474
00:34:39,093 --> 00:34:40,554
Actually, I was born in the Regency room.

475
00:34:40,742 --> 00:34:43,316
I started out doing what I had to.

476
00:34:44,452 --> 00:34:47,636
Once you're done what you had to,
They never let you do what you wanted to.

477
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:49,046
Start fresh.

478
00:34:49,724 --> 00:34:52,376
There's no fresh start in today's world.

479
00:34:52,768 --> 00:34:55,480
Any 12 years with a cell phone
would find out what you did.

480
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:59,906
Everything we do is collated
and quantified everything sticks.

481
00:34:59,999 --> 00:35:02,557
Is that how you justify stealing?

482
00:35:02,663 --> 00:35:05,255
I take what I need from those
who have more than enough.

483
00:35:05,349 --> 00:35:07,497
I don't stand on the shoulders
of the people with less.

484
00:35:07,607 --> 00:35:08,669
Robin Hood?

485
00:35:08,859 --> 00:35:11,549
I think I do more to help someone
than most of the people in this room.

486
00:35:11,846 --> 00:35:13,010
Than you.

487
00:35:14,235 --> 00:35:16,007
I think maybe you're
assuming a little too much.

488
00:35:16,124 --> 00:35:18,606
Maybe you're being unrealistic
about what's really...

489
00:35:18,607 --> 00:35:20,546
...in your pants other than wallets.

490
00:35:20,647 --> 00:35:21,206
Ouch.

491
00:35:21,888 --> 00:35:23,588
You think all this can last?

492
00:35:24,088 --> 00:35:26,988
There's a storm coming, Mr. Wayne.

493
00:35:27,588 --> 00:35:30,182
You and your friends better
battered down the hatches...

494
00:35:30,482 --> 00:35:36,258
...because when it hits, you’re all gonna wonder
How you ever thought you could live so large...

495
00:35:36,459 --> 00:35:39,482
...and leave so little for the rest of us.

496
00:35:42,482 --> 00:35:45,282
You sound like you're looking forward to it.

497
00:35:46,382 --> 00:35:47,682
I'm adaptable.

498
00:35:48,182 --> 00:35:51,286
Those pearls
do look better on you than it did in my safe.

499
00:35:52,122 --> 00:35:54,866
But I still can't let you keep them.

500
00:36:01,575 --> 00:36:04,711
You scared her off!

501
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,703
Not likely.

502
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:12,016
I still lost my ticket.

503
00:36:12,325 --> 00:36:14,945
- Your wife said you're taking the cab home.
- My wife?

504
00:36:22,848 --> 00:36:25,209
Just you, sir?

505
00:36:27,552 --> 00:36:29,505
Don't worry, Master Wayne.

506
00:36:30,299 --> 00:36:33,441
Takes a little time to get back in the swing of things.

507
00:36:35,584 --> 00:36:36,613
<i>Bruce Wayne.</i>

508
00:36:36,814 --> 00:36:38,673
As I live and breathe.

509
00:36:40,577 --> 00:36:43,297
What brings you out of prior sleep, Mr. Wayne?

510
00:36:43,426 --> 00:36:44,924
I see you haven't lost your sense of humor...

511
00:36:45,027 --> 00:36:47,505
...even if you have lost
most of my money.

512
00:36:47,732 --> 00:36:49,029
Actually you did that.

513
00:36:49,304 --> 00:36:55,129
If you follow all your entire RND budget to
a fusion project that you get mothball...

514
00:36:55,212 --> 00:36:56,976
...your company is unlikely to thrive.

515
00:36:57,448 --> 00:36:59,005
What are the options?

516
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:01,323
Well if you're not unwilling
to turn on the machine.

517
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:04,178
I can't. I can't, Lucius.

518
00:37:05,093 --> 00:37:06,104
Well then sit tight.

519
00:37:06,194 --> 00:37:08,031
Your majority keep dagger at bay...

520
00:37:08,138 --> 00:37:12,508
...while we figured out a future for the
energy program with Miranda Tate.

521
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:15,146
She has supported the project all the way.

522
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:18,993
She's smart and quite lovely.

523
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:23,230
We all just want what's best for you, Bruce.

524
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:24,827
Show her the machine.

525
00:37:25,628 --> 00:37:27,116
I think it over.

526
00:37:27,727 --> 00:37:28,843
Anything else?

527
00:37:29,244 --> 00:37:31,007
Nope. Why?

528
00:37:31,595 --> 00:37:35,992
These conversations always used to
end with an unusual request.

529
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:38,332
I retired.

530
00:37:39,628 --> 00:37:42,304
Let me show you some stuff, anyway.

531
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:48,256
Just for old times' sake.

532
00:37:51,876 --> 00:37:54,054
I figured you had to shut this place down.

533
00:37:54,319 --> 00:37:56,743
Oh, it was always shut down.
Officially.

534
00:37:56,944 --> 00:37:58,269
What's the new stuff.

535
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:00,770
After your father died,
Wayne Enterprises...

536
00:38:00,771 --> 00:38:03,144
...has set up 14 different defense subsidiaries.

537
00:38:03,339 --> 00:38:08,025
For years, I've been shuttering and consolidating
all the different prototypes under one roof.

538
00:38:08,931 --> 00:38:09,896
- My roof.
- Why?

539
00:38:10,637 --> 00:38:13,439
Keep them from falling into the wrong hands.

540
00:38:16,202 --> 00:38:17,992
Now you just showing off.

541
00:38:19,635 --> 00:38:21,309
Defense department project.

542
00:38:21,464 --> 00:38:23,913
Tight Geometer Urban Pacification.

543
00:38:24,892 --> 00:38:27,290
Rotors are configured
to maneuver between buildings...

544
00:38:27,384 --> 00:38:29,156
...without recirculation.

545
00:38:29,914 --> 00:38:31,393
What it's called?

546
00:38:32,082 --> 00:38:36,404
It has a long uninteresting
Wayne Enterprise’s designation.

547
00:38:36,493 --> 00:38:39,431
I just the took of calling it
The Bat.

548
00:38:40,637 --> 00:38:43,813
And yes Mr. Wayne, it does come in black.

549
00:38:45,144 --> 00:38:48,058
Works fine, except for the autopilot.

550
00:38:48,549 --> 00:38:50,443
Take a better mind than mine to fix it.

551
00:38:50,736 --> 00:38:52,283
A better mind?

552
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,619
Well I was trying to be modest.

553
00:38:55,905 --> 00:38:59,712
A less busy mind, yours.

554
00:39:07,036 --> 00:39:08,336
It should be a painful.

555
00:39:08,736 --> 00:39:10,236
You’re welcome to try it, Alfred.

556
00:39:10,536 --> 00:39:13,537
Happy watching.
Thank you, Sir.

557
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:17,555
Not bad.

558
00:39:21,941 --> 00:39:24,138
Not bad at all

559
00:39:26,837 --> 00:39:30,238
If you're seriously
considering going back out there...

560
00:39:30,338 --> 00:39:32,649
...you should hear the rumors
surrounding Bane.

561
00:39:32,849 --> 00:39:33,847
I'm all ears.

562
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:37,946
There is a prison
in a more ancient part of the world.

563
00:39:38,145 --> 00:39:44,038
A pit where men are thrown to suffer and die.

564
00:39:44,138 --> 00:39:47,838
But sometimes
a man rises from the darkness.

565
00:39:48,138 --> 00:39:52,239
Sometimes, the pit sends something back.

566
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:52,827
Bane?

567
00:39:53,228 --> 00:39:54,139
Right.

568
00:39:54,738 --> 00:39:57,640
Born and raised in hell on earth.

569
00:39:57,841 --> 00:39:58,644
Born in a prison?

570
00:39:58,944 --> 00:40:01,644
No one knows why or how he escaped.

571
00:40:01,743 --> 00:40:08,717
But they do know once he did, he was
trained by Ra's Al Ghul, your mentor.

572
00:40:08,843 --> 00:40:11,309
Bane was a member
of The League of Shadows.

573
00:40:11,385 --> 00:40:13,667
And then he was excommunicated.

574
00:40:13,763 --> 00:40:17,389
And any man
who is too extreme for Ra's Al Ghul...

575
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:19,575
...is not to be trifled with.

576
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:23,583
I didn't realized I  was known
for trifling with criminals.

577
00:40:23,688 --> 00:40:25,215
That was then.

578
00:40:25,323 --> 00:40:28,587
Then you can just strap up your leg
and put your mask back on,...

579
00:40:28,691 --> 00:40:30,767
...but that doesn't make you what you were.

580
00:40:30,879 --> 00:40:35,702
If this man is everything what you say he is,
then the city needs me.

581
00:40:36,011 --> 00:40:41,221
The city needs Bruce Wayne,
your resources, your knowledge.

582
00:40:41,222 --> 00:40:44,372
It doesn't need your body,
or your life.

583
00:40:44,969 --> 00:40:46,461
That times has past.

584
00:40:46,556 --> 00:40:49,741
You're afraid if I go back out there,
I'll fail.

585
00:40:50,336 --> 00:40:51,197
No.

586
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:56,624
I'm afraid that you want to.

587
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:13,518
You can't short the stock if
Bruce Wayne goes to a party.

588
00:41:13,617 --> 00:41:14,991
Wayne's coming back has change.

589
00:41:15,101 --> 00:41:17,691
- Changes, is it good or bad?
- I vote bad.

590
00:41:17,769 --> 00:41:20,729
- On what basis?
- I flip the coin.

591
00:41:26,905 --> 00:41:29,004
I said no rye man.

592
00:41:31,675 --> 00:41:35,191
Rookie! Loose the helmet!
We need faces for camera.

593
00:41:40,194 --> 00:41:42,394
Come on let's go scalping.

594
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,642
This is a stock exchange.
There's no money you can steal.

595
00:42:46,783 --> 00:42:50,345
Really?
 Then why are you people here?

596
00:43:14,475 --> 00:43:16,277
You got to get in there!

597
00:43:16,377 --> 00:43:19,381
- It's a hostage situation.
- No! This is a robbery!

598
00:43:19,481 --> 00:43:21,693
They have direct access to
the online trading desk.

599
00:43:21,793 --> 00:43:24,196
I'm not risking my men
for your money.

600
00:43:27,597 --> 00:43:29,997
Sir, you going to ask you to move.
We have a situation here.

601
00:43:30,097 --> 00:43:32,190
It's not our money,
it's everybody's.

602
00:43:32,283 --> 00:43:34,456
Really? Mine is in my mattress.

603
00:43:34,576 --> 00:43:35,868
If don't put these guys down,

604
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:39,302
that something in your mattress maybe
be worth a whole hell of a lot less.

605
00:43:39,397 --> 00:43:41,720
Cut the fiber cable and
take out that cell tower.

606
00:43:41,818 --> 00:43:43,923
- Thank you.
- That will slow them down.

607
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:51,694
They cut the Fiber.

608
00:43:52,975 --> 00:43:56,130
- The cell's working.
- For now.

609
00:44:01,372 --> 00:44:02,376
Get all this barriers up.

610
00:44:02,475 --> 00:44:03,239
I want all of them up.

611
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,872
No one gets in or out of
any of these streets.

612
00:44:04,926 --> 00:44:08,260
- Where am I suppose to move it?
- Back it up.

613
00:44:12,545 --> 00:44:14,841
Just stay in your vehicle, okay?

614
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:24,714
How much longer does
the program need?

615
00:44:25,507 --> 00:44:27,504
Eight minutes.

616
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:29,796
Time to go move out.

617
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:31,345
Everybody up!

618
00:44:35,269 --> 00:44:36,923
You two, move!

619
00:44:39,206 --> 00:44:41,159
Thank you.

620
00:44:41,530 --> 00:44:42,840
Steady!

621
00:44:51,379 --> 00:44:53,215
Steady!

622
00:45:01,255 --> 00:45:02,836
I got something!

623
00:45:03,055 --> 00:45:05,579
Do not shoot! We've hostages!

624
00:45:05,710 --> 00:45:07,228
Hold your fire!

625
00:45:16,861 --> 00:45:18,367
Go! Go!

626
00:45:28,355 --> 00:45:30,206
Hey, let me go!

627
00:45:30,844 --> 00:45:34,093
Please! Help!

628
00:45:35,872 --> 00:45:38,923
- Shoot the tires!
- There's no shot.

629
00:45:40,235 --> 00:45:43,414
Now back off! Back off!
They've got hostages!

630
00:45:43,510 --> 00:45:45,570
<i>Police are pursuing
the 4 suspects from</i>

<i>Gotham PD...</i>

633
00:45:55,031 --> 00:45:56,937
What's going on with the lights?

634
00:46:03,806 --> 00:46:05,598
I can't pick up anything!

635
00:46:05,724 --> 00:46:06,747
Who the hell was that?

636
00:46:06,876 --> 00:46:10,156
Oh boy you're in for a show tonight, son!

637
00:46:15,141 --> 00:46:17,154
Please! Help!

638
00:46:35,222 --> 00:46:36,721
Sorry!

639
00:46:36,821 --> 00:46:39,319
Put that thing away before
you hurt yourself.

640
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:39,920
Get in!

641
00:46:39,921 --> 00:46:41,919
Let's go. You, get in the car!

642
00:46:42,019 --> 00:46:43,919
We've spotted The Batman!

643
00:46:54,515 --> 00:46:55,516
I want all everyone in.

644
00:46:55,616 --> 00:46:57,817
Every car patrol, street
cops and off duty too.

645
00:46:57,917 --> 00:46:59,117
Call them in now!

646
00:46:59,216 --> 00:47:00,912
I'm going to do what
Jim Gordon never could.

647
00:47:01,012 --> 00:47:03,808
- What's that?
- I'm going to take down The Batman.

648
00:47:05,194 --> 00:47:07,189
<i>...the 4 suspect are carrying two hostages...</i>

649
00:47:07,273 --> 00:47:09,372
<i>...that they kidnapped them at
the Gotham Stock Exchange.</i>

650
00:47:09,497 --> 00:47:11,143
<i>Witnesses reported that ...</i>

651
00:47:14,005 --> 00:47:15,432
<i>It seems hard to believe.</i>

652
00:47:15,433 --> 00:47:18,149
<i>But report are suspects
are now being pursued...</i>

653
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:19,999
<i>...what appears to be, The Batman.</i>

654
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:22,301
Well what do you know?

655
00:47:26,751 --> 00:47:29,929
Sir, what about the armed robbers?

656
00:47:31,121 --> 00:47:34,803
Please! Let me go! Please!

657
00:47:43,775 --> 00:47:44,648
<i> One bike has pulled off. </i>

658
00:47:44,939 --> 00:47:46,939
<i> No hostage. Shall we pursue? </i>

659
00:47:51,976 --> 00:47:54,035
Negative. Stay on The Batman!

660
00:47:56,219 --> 00:47:58,080
- He's getting away.
- Who do you want to catch huh?

661
00:47:58,169 --> 00:48:01,101
Some robber or the son of a bitch,
who killed Harvey Dent?

662
00:48:10,034 --> 00:48:13,015
Eight years and he has to pick tonight.

663
00:48:13,216 --> 00:48:15,759
He's drawing the cops off Bane.

664
00:48:23,990 --> 00:48:28,176
Please! Just let me go! Please!

665
00:49:01,617 --> 00:49:03,966
<i>Transefering Complete</i>

666
00:49:45,887 --> 00:49:46,967
<i> We lost him. </i>

667
00:49:47,271 --> 00:49:49,125
How could you lose him?

668
00:49:49,254 --> 00:49:50,624
<i> He's got a lot of firepower. </i>

669
00:49:50,765 --> 00:49:52,421
What?... You don't ?!

670
00:49:56,977 --> 00:49:58,575
<i> He heads back downtown. </i>

671
00:49:58,938 --> 00:50:00,862
And he's as dumb as he dresses.

672
00:50:00,975 --> 00:50:02,948
Close it up, gentlemen!

673
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:38,090
Like a rat in a trap, gentlemen!

674
00:50:43,059 --> 00:50:46,512
Who might've the wrong animal there, Sir ?!

675
00:50:56,905 --> 00:50:58,907
You're sure it was him?

676
00:51:05,292 --> 00:51:08,648
<i> Bane says that Batman interfered,
but the task was accomplished. </i>

677
00:51:08,961 --> 00:51:10,628
What about the men they've arrested?

678
00:51:10,753 --> 00:51:15,433
He said and I quote, 
"They would die before talking."

679
00:51:16,199 --> 00:51:18,933
Where does he finds these guys?

680
00:51:20,032 --> 00:51:22,069
Open the champagne!

681
00:51:23,899 --> 00:51:28,363
- And can we get some girls in here?
- Be careful what you wish for!

682
00:51:38,792 --> 00:51:41,718
- Cat got your tongue?
- You dumb bitch!

683
00:51:41,823 --> 00:51:43,947
Nobody ever accuse of being dumb.

684
00:51:44,055 --> 00:51:47,581
You're dumb, for coming here tonight.

685
00:51:48,005 --> 00:51:51,268
I want what you owe me.

686
00:51:51,889 --> 00:51:53,878
One doesn't get...

687
00:51:54,179 --> 00:51:55,409
Nice outfit.

688
00:51:56,103 --> 00:51:58,115
Aren't those heels make
it tough to walk?

689
00:51:58,222 --> 00:51:59,337
I don't know.

690
00:52:00,538 --> 00:52:01,291
Do you think?

691
00:52:03,067 --> 00:52:04,673
- So where is it?
- Where's what?

692
00:52:04,789 --> 00:52:07,157
The program  "The Clean Slate".

693
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:10,702
The Ultimate Tool for a
master thief with a record.

694
00:52:11,334 --> 00:52:12,862
Hold it right there!

695
00:52:26,373 --> 00:52:29,782
- Where is it?!
- "The Clean Slate" ?

696
00:52:29,872 --> 00:52:31,830
When you type in someone's name,
date of birth...

697
00:52:31,877 --> 00:52:36,332
...and a few minutes they're gone,
every database on earth.

698
00:52:36,488 --> 00:52:39,001
Sounds a little too good to be true?

699
00:52:39,097 --> 00:52:42,766
You're lying!... <i>Riken Data</i> took
it to the prototype stage.

700
00:52:43,092 --> 00:52:45,165
That's why I bought them.

701
00:52:45,334 --> 00:52:47,406
But they had nothing.

702
00:52:48,507 --> 00:52:50,220
It was a gang-land myth.

703
00:53:01,313 --> 00:53:03,037
Stay back!

704
00:53:05,811 --> 00:53:07,773
I'm not bluffing!

705
00:53:08,394 --> 00:53:12,014
They know.
They just don't care.

706
00:53:29,142 --> 00:53:30,288
You gotta be kidding me.

707
00:53:30,489 --> 00:53:31,530
No guns, no killing.

708
00:53:31,830 --> 00:53:33,371
Where the fun in that?

709
00:53:52,072 --> 00:53:54,292
My mother warned about getting
into cars with strange, Man.

710
00:53:54,584 --> 00:53:56,693
This isn't car.

711
00:54:46,218 --> 00:54:47,877
See you around

712
00:54:48,689 --> 00:54:50,164
You're welcome

713
00:54:50,255 --> 00:54:51,501
I had it under control.

714
00:54:51,702 --> 00:54:53,270
Those weren't street thugs.

715
00:54:53,511 --> 00:54:57,025
They were trained killers.
I saved your life.

716
00:54:57,080 --> 00:55:01,716
In return, I need to know what you did
with Bruce Wayne's fingerprints.

717
00:55:01,805 --> 00:55:04,824
Wayne wasn't kidding about a powerful friend.

718
00:55:05,349 --> 00:55:08,350
I sold his prints to Daggett.

719
00:55:08,537 --> 00:55:12,203
Something that doesn't even exist.

720
00:55:12,590 --> 00:55:14,422
I doubt that will get the better of you.

721
00:55:14,638 --> 00:55:15,877
Hey when a girl's desperate...

722
00:55:16,078 --> 00:55:17,695
What's he going to do with them?

723
00:55:17,799 --> 00:55:18,679
I don't know.

724
00:55:19,059 --> 00:55:22,424
But Dagget seem pretty interested
in that mess at the stock market.

725
00:55:27,597 --> 00:55:29,582
Miss Kyle...

726
00:55:31,869 --> 00:55:34,553
So that's what that feels like...

727
00:55:53,429 --> 00:55:57,829
I've seen you in the television coverage, you've
got your taste for wanting destruction back.

728
00:55:58,228 --> 00:55:59,929
I retrieved this.

729
00:56:00,331 --> 00:56:02,845
Aren't the police suppose
to be investigating them?

730
00:56:02,944 --> 00:56:04,748
They don't have the tools to analyze it.

731
00:56:04,948 --> 00:56:06,249
They would if you gave it to them.

732
00:56:06,549 --> 00:56:09,141
One man's tool is another man weapon.

733
00:56:09,241 --> 00:56:12,446
In your mind perhaps, but there aren't
many things can't turn into a weapons.

734
00:56:12,547 --> 00:56:14,549
Alfred, enough!
The police weren't getting it done

735
00:56:14,650 --> 00:56:17,850
Maybe they might have. If you hadn't
made the side show of yourself.

736
00:56:18,050 --> 00:56:19,451
You I didn't had it in me.

737
00:56:19,550 --> 00:56:21,751
You don't. You got to glow at the
police force, a married chased...

738
00:56:21,850 --> 00:56:25,050
...with a lot of fancy new toys from Fox's.

739
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:26,751
What about when you come up against him?

740
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:28,049
What then?

741
00:56:28,148 --> 00:56:29,242
I'll fight harder. I always have.

742
00:56:29,342 --> 00:56:33,139
Take a look, his speed, his ferocity, his training.

743
00:56:33,239 --> 00:56:35,747
I see the power of believe.

744
00:56:35,847 --> 00:56:38,934
I see The League of Shadows insurgent.

745
00:56:39,033 --> 00:56:42,632
- You said he was excommunicated.
- By Ra's Al Ghul.

746
00:56:42,731 --> 00:56:44,932
Who leads them now?

747
00:56:45,032 --> 00:56:47,332
Ra's Al Ghul was The League
of Shadows and I beat him.

748
00:56:47,432 --> 00:56:50,232
Bane is just a mercenary,
we need to find out what he's up to.

749
00:56:51,596 --> 00:56:54,908
Trade of some kind. Coded.

750
00:56:54,997 --> 00:56:57,922
And my fingerprints courtesy of Selina Kyle.

751
00:56:58,018 --> 00:56:59,030
Give this to Fox.

752
00:56:59,136 --> 00:57:00,504
He can crack the code...

753
00:57:00,505 --> 00:57:03,567
...and tell us what trades they were executing.

754
00:57:07,281 --> 00:57:10,896
I'll give this to Mr. Fox,
but no more.

755
00:57:12,513 --> 00:57:16,318
I sewed you up, I set your bums,
but I wont bury you.

756
00:57:16,411 --> 00:57:20,067
I buried enough members in
The Wayne family.

757
00:57:20,462 --> 00:57:21,552
You're leaving me?

758
00:57:21,641 --> 00:57:25,589
You see only one end
to your journey.

759
00:57:26,011 --> 00:57:30,565
Leaving is all I have
to make you understand.

760
00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:34,206
You're not Batman anymore.
You have to find another way.

761
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:38,910
You used to talked about finishing
about a light on that awful cave.

762
00:57:39,003 --> 00:57:42,586
Alfred, Rachel died
knowing that we had decided to be together.

763
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:44,121
That was my life beyond the cave.

764
00:57:44,418 --> 00:57:46,690
I can't just move on.

765
00:57:47,099 --> 00:57:50,438
She didn't, she couldn't have.

766
00:57:50,684 --> 00:57:51,857
What did she had?

767
00:57:52,964 --> 00:57:53,701
I can't change that.

768
00:57:53,993 --> 00:57:56,843
What if before she died,
she’d written a letter?

769
00:57:57,132 --> 00:58:01,033
Saying she choose Harvey Dent over you?

770
00:58:04,779 --> 00:58:09,565
And what if to spare your pain....

771
00:58:10,891 --> 00:58:13,706
...I burned that letter?

772
00:58:13,941 --> 00:58:15,758
How dare you use Rachel...

773
00:58:17,073 --> 00:58:17,996
...to try and stop me.

774
00:58:18,273 --> 00:58:21,427
I am using to choose, Master Wayne.

775
00:58:22,156 --> 00:58:24,759
Maybe it's time we all start trying
to out smart the truth...

776
00:58:24,866 --> 00:58:27,807
...and let it have it stay.

777
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:30,571
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

778
00:58:30,886 --> 00:58:34,349
You expect to destroy my world...

779
00:58:35,737 --> 00:58:38,640
...and then think we're going to shake hands?

780
00:58:38,945 --> 00:58:40,059
No.. No..

781
00:58:42,914 --> 00:58:44,293
- What this means.
- What is your mean?

782
00:58:45,045 --> 00:58:49,528
It means your hatred
and it also mean losing someone.

783
00:58:49,729 --> 00:58:58,821
Who I've cared kept for since I first heard
his cries echoes through this house.

784
00:58:59,069 --> 00:59:03,817
But it might also mean.
Saving your life.

785
00:59:04,435 --> 00:59:08,179
And that's more important.

786
00:59:12,127 --> 00:59:14,606
Good bye, Alfred!

787
00:59:33,097 --> 00:59:35,524
Alfred?

788
00:59:39,353 --> 00:59:41,801
- Answering your own door?
- Yeah.

789
00:59:43,269 --> 00:59:45,060
Page 3.

790
00:59:45,184 --> 00:59:49,352
Seem you made a series a laud
put options on the future exchange.

791
00:59:49,457 --> 00:59:50,987
Verified by thumb print.

792
00:59:51,096 --> 00:59:53,464
Those options expired at midnight last night.

793
00:59:53,668 --> 00:59:56,788
Long term we may be able to prove
it was a fraud but for now,...

794
00:59:56,965 --> 00:59:58,310
...you're completely broke.

795
00:59:58,567 --> 01:00:02,279
And Wayne Enterprises is about to fall
into the hands of John Daggett.

796
01:00:02,436 --> 01:00:03,856
The weapons.

797
01:00:03,966 --> 01:00:06,154
...We can't let Daggett get his hands
on the applied sciences.

798
01:00:06,448 --> 01:00:09,488
Applied sciences is all lock
up and off the books.

799
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:12,481
The energy project however
is a different story.

800
01:00:12,776 --> 01:00:14,571
Miranda Tate.

801
01:00:15,369 --> 01:00:17,154
We need to convince the board
to get behind her.

802
01:00:17,457 --> 01:00:18,403
Let's show her the reactor.

803
01:00:18,606 --> 01:00:22,201
We're meeting her there in 35 minutes.
So you better get dressed.

804
01:00:22,415 --> 01:00:25,644
You brought me out here to show me this, Mr. Fox?

805
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:28,592
Bear with me, Miss. Tate.

806
01:00:32,206 --> 01:00:36,094
Please keep hands and
feet in the car at all time.

807
01:00:41,262 --> 01:00:42,869
This is it, isn't it?

808
01:00:43,662 --> 01:00:45,674
The reactor is beneath the river.

809
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:50,304
So it can be instantly flooded
in an event of a security breach.

810
01:00:50,444 --> 01:00:54,051
Is Bruce Wayne really that paranoid?

811
01:00:54,445 --> 01:00:56,676
I fail to give an answer on that one.

812
01:01:03,419 --> 01:01:06,505
I thought you might like to see
what your investment builds.

813
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:10,918
No fossil fuels, free clean energy
for an entire city.

814
01:01:11,028 --> 01:01:17,282
Three years ago, a Russian scientist published
a paper on weaponize fusion reactions.

815
01:01:17,378 --> 01:01:22,571
One week later,
your reactor started developing problems.

816
01:01:22,742 --> 01:01:24,897
I think this machine works.

817
01:01:25,228 --> 01:01:28,828
Miranda, if it were operational...

818
01:01:30,614 --> 01:01:31,794
...danger to Gotham would be too great.

819
01:01:32,101 --> 01:01:35,167
Would it make you feel better to know
that the Russian scientist...

820
01:01:35,368 --> 01:01:38,218
...died in a plane crash six months ago?

821
01:01:38,343 --> 01:01:41,980
Someone been working hard,
with Dr. Pavel...

822
01:01:42,091 --> 01:01:43,994
...Someone will figured out a way to...

823
01:01:44,195 --> 01:01:48,096
...make this power source into
a nuclear weapon.

824
01:01:49,392 --> 01:01:55,490
I need you to take control
of Wayne Enterprises and this reactor.

825
01:01:55,789 --> 01:01:58,229
- To do what with it?
- Nothing.

826
01:01:59,063 --> 01:02:01,182
Until we can guarantee it's safety.

827
01:02:01,483 --> 01:02:02,641
And if we can't?

828
01:02:02,856 --> 01:02:04,307
Decommission it, flood it.

829
01:02:04,633 --> 01:02:08,249
Destroy the world's best chance
for a sustainable future?

830
01:02:08,542 --> 01:02:10,235
The world is not ready, yes.

831
01:02:10,387 --> 01:02:12,529
Bruce, if you want to save the world...

832
01:02:12,830 --> 01:02:14,792
...you have to start trusting it.

833
01:02:14,837 --> 01:02:15,585
I'm trust you.

834
01:02:16,586 --> 01:02:18,125
It doesn't count.
You have no choice.

835
01:02:19,531 --> 01:02:21,716
I could've flooded this chamber at
any time in the last three years...

836
01:02:21,872 --> 01:02:23,994
...I'm choosing, to trust you.

837
01:02:24,595 --> 01:02:25,768
Please.

838
01:02:33,178 --> 01:02:37,078
Alright ladies and gentlemen,
this meeting will now come to order.

839
01:02:37,378 --> 01:02:40,471
Then I would like to point out that
we have a non-board member here.

840
01:02:40,570 --> 01:02:43,969
There is highly irregular, even if
his name is above the door.

841
01:02:44,269 --> 01:02:46,370
Bruce Wayne's family built this company.

842
01:02:46,669 --> 01:02:50,356
- And he himself has run it...
- Into the ground!, Sir.

843
01:02:50,756 --> 01:02:51,856
Does anybody disagrees?

844
01:02:51,956 --> 01:02:53,056
Check the share prices this morning.

845
01:02:53,356 --> 01:02:57,917
Crazy gambling on future
is not only cost Mr. Wayne his seat...

846
01:02:58,118 --> 01:03:02,456
..it's cost us all.
A lot of money and he has to go.

847
01:03:02,956 --> 01:03:06,057
I'm afraid he has a point, Mr. Wayne.

848
01:03:13,458 --> 01:03:15,158
Well back to business.

849
01:03:16,856 --> 01:03:18,956
How does it feel to be one of the people, Wayne?

850
01:03:19,548 --> 01:03:22,561
Mr. Wayne, they're towing your car.
I didn't know that you're off the board.

851
01:03:24,884 --> 01:03:26,173
Looks like you'll need a ride huh?

852
01:03:26,592 --> 01:03:29,046
Mr. Wayne, will you get a ride?

853
01:03:29,372 --> 01:03:33,162
What the hell did Miranda Tate get the inside
track on the Wayne board?

854
01:03:33,269 --> 01:03:35,093
I mean, she been meeting with him?

855
01:03:35,367 --> 01:03:36,458
- She been sleeping with him?
- Not that we know of.

856
01:03:37,067 --> 01:03:39,284
Oh clearly you don't know much
of anything, do you? Where's Bane?

857
01:03:39,664 --> 01:03:41,707
- We told him it was urgent.
- Where is that man?

858
01:03:42,089 --> 01:03:45,324
Speak of the devil, and he shall appears.

859
01:03:45,719 --> 01:03:48,783
What the hell is going on?

860
01:03:49,028 --> 01:03:51,927
The plan is preceding as expected.

861
01:03:52,024 --> 01:03:56,062
Really? Do I look like I'm running
Wayne Enterprises right now?

862
01:03:56,571 --> 01:03:58,967
Your hit on the stock exchange,...

863
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,987
...it didn't work my friend.
And now you have my construction crews...

864
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:05,922
...going around the city at 24 hours a day.

865
01:04:06,032 --> 01:04:11,557
How exactly is that suppose to help
my company absorbs Wayne?

866
01:04:13,646 --> 01:04:16,206
- Leave us!
- No!... Stay here.

867
01:04:16,302 --> 01:04:17,923
I'm in charge.

868
01:04:18,590 --> 01:04:21,479
Do you feel in charge?

869
01:04:25,991 --> 01:04:27,779
I have paid you a small fortune.

870
01:04:27,944 --> 01:04:31,189
And this gives you power over me?

871
01:04:31,473 --> 01:04:32,919
What is this?

872
01:04:33,043 --> 01:04:38,415
Your money and infrastructure
have been important...

873
01:04:38,512 --> 01:04:39,763
...till now.

874
01:04:40,137 --> 01:04:43,218
- What are you?
- I'm Gotham Reckoning.

875
01:04:43,328 --> 01:04:46,814
It'll end of all the damn you've been living on.

876
01:04:48,247 --> 01:04:51,149
You are pure evil.

877
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:53,286
A necessary evil.

878
01:04:53,687 --> 01:04:54,502
No!

879
01:05:00,487 --> 01:05:02,850
Well you've started quite a mess.

880
01:05:03,207 --> 01:05:04,725
To protect the people closes to me.

881
01:05:05,004 --> 01:05:06,871
Maybe you're a loner, right?
You didn't have a family.

882
01:05:06,982 --> 01:05:08,987
There are always people
that you care about.

883
01:05:11,017 --> 01:05:13,475
But you didn't realize how
much until they're gone.

884
01:05:13,655 --> 01:05:16,468
The idea was to be a symbol.

885
01:05:16,662 --> 01:05:22,031
Batman can be anybody.
That was the point.

886
01:05:22,218 --> 01:05:25,434
- Well it damn good to see him back.
- Not everybody agrees.

887
01:05:25,543 --> 01:05:27,033
I'll figured that out in the end.

888
01:05:27,248 --> 01:05:30,002
We got anything on Bane's whereabouts?

889
01:05:30,443 --> 01:05:33,523
Yes, I have 500 pages of tunnel
records and a flashlight.

890
01:05:33,816 --> 01:05:35,543
I could use some help actually.

891
01:05:36,911 --> 01:05:38,853
You know what,
drop me in the old town.

892
01:05:43,296 --> 01:05:45,953
<i> - I don't think so!
- That is not how it works. </i>

893
01:05:46,233 --> 01:05:48,102
- That is...
- He's not a mark.

894
01:05:48,414 --> 01:05:51,154
and he doesn't have a cent
to his name, anyway.

895
01:05:51,798 --> 01:05:53,497
Yeah, It's not much.

896
01:05:53,798 --> 01:05:55,934
But it's more than you got right now.

897
01:05:56,388 --> 01:05:58,904
Actually, they're
letting me keep the house.

898
01:05:59,011 --> 01:06:01,689
The rich doesn't even go broke
like the rest of us, huh?

899
01:06:01,797 --> 01:06:05,710
My powerful friend might hope
to change your mind about leaving.

900
01:06:06,003 --> 01:06:08,470
- And how would he do that?
- By giving you what you want.

901
01:06:08,612 --> 01:06:10,307
It doesn't exist.

902
01:06:10,608 --> 01:06:11,381
He says it does.

903
01:06:11,838 --> 01:06:13,719
He wants to meet tonight.

904
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:14,636
Why?

905
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:18,702
He needs to find Bane.
He says you know how.

906
01:06:21,450 --> 01:06:25,723
- Tell him I'll think about it.
- Okay. I like your place.

907
01:06:27,222 --> 01:06:28,591
Mr. Wayne

908
01:06:30,852 --> 01:06:33,446
I'm sorry, that to clear your money.

909
01:06:33,951 --> 01:06:35,491
No. you're not.

910
01:06:36,703 --> 01:06:39,122
- Can we help you officer?
- Yeah.

911
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:41,847
John Daggett's body was found
in a dumpster an hour ago.

912
01:06:42,048 --> 01:06:44,518
Thought you might wanna know.

913
01:06:44,647 --> 01:06:45,670
Why?

914
01:06:45,679 --> 01:06:47,498
Well his name is all over this permit I just...

915
01:06:47,499 --> 01:06:49,155
...pulled to half the tunnel under Gotham.

916
01:06:49,282 --> 01:06:53,333
That is MTA maintenance, sewer
construction and others things...

917
01:06:53,449 --> 01:06:55,673
What did you get with the
tunnel searches?

918
01:06:56,738 --> 01:06:59,787
Remind me 
to tell detail to keep hot heads out.

919
01:07:00,062 --> 01:07:01,813
We had teams down there.
It's a huge network.

920
01:07:02,111 --> 01:07:03,483
Well Get more, man.

921
01:07:03,761 --> 01:07:05,518
Work a grid.. I want him found.

922
01:07:05,809 --> 01:07:07,967
Yeah. The Masked Man. 
We're on it.

923
01:07:08,260 --> 01:07:11,084
Lose the uniform.
You’re working for me now.

924
01:07:11,210 --> 01:07:13,422
We could use some hotter heads around here.

925
01:07:13,778 --> 01:07:15,488
Sir, Daggett's death could only be a coincidence.

926
01:07:15,597 --> 01:07:17,364
You're a detective now, son.

927
01:07:17,519 --> 01:07:21,328
You're not allowed to believe 
in coincidences anymore.

928
01:07:32,492 --> 01:07:34,117
Nobody's answering.

929
01:07:34,618 --> 01:07:35,629
No.

930
01:07:35,726 --> 01:07:37,486
I'm... on my own now.

931
01:07:37,787 --> 01:07:39,950
Do you have keys?

932
01:07:40,809 --> 01:07:42,418
I never needed them.

933
01:07:48,718 --> 01:07:50,783
I hope you didn't liked reaching my money.

934
01:07:51,022 --> 01:07:53,328
Suffering this character.

935
01:07:59,827 --> 01:08:03,015
I'll take care of your parents legacy, Bruce.

936
01:08:04,515 --> 01:08:05,918
Who's this?

937
01:08:13,516 --> 01:08:15,409
Where is Alfred?

938
01:08:16,706 --> 01:08:18,608
He left...

939
01:08:19,914 --> 01:08:21,816
...taking everything...

940
01:08:45,713 --> 01:08:46,834
What's that?

941
01:08:48,035 --> 01:08:50,812
Our power has been shut off.

942
01:08:55,812 --> 01:08:57,910
You're good at that.

943
01:08:58,211 --> 01:09:00,811
When I was a child, 
we had almost nothing.

944
01:09:01,111 --> 01:09:06,914
But on the nights, 
when we had a fire, We felt very rich indeed...

945
01:09:07,919 --> 01:09:11,327
I assumed your family was wealthy.

946
01:09:11,727 --> 01:09:15,826
Not always. Not when I was young.

947
01:09:16,423 --> 01:09:18,476
An old mistake.

948
01:09:19,577 --> 01:09:21,510
I've made a few myself.

949
01:09:22,413 --> 01:09:24,813
More than a few.

950
01:09:26,411 --> 01:09:30,010
I could leave, tonight.

951
01:09:30,210 --> 01:09:34,816
Take my plane and go anywhere we wanted.

952
01:09:36,025 --> 01:09:40,319
Some day perhaps. Not tonight.

953
01:10:08,613 --> 01:10:10,114
Don't be shy.

954
01:10:12,519 --> 01:10:14,921
Wayne said that you can get me 
"The Clean Slate".

955
01:10:15,121 --> 01:10:16,381
That depends...

956
01:10:16,982 --> 01:10:18,021
On what?

957
01:10:18,321 --> 01:10:19,717
On what you want it for...

958
01:10:20,017 --> 01:10:23,114
...I have acquire it to keep it out 
of the wrong hands.

959
01:10:23,214 --> 01:10:25,414
Still don't trust me, huh?

960
01:10:26,613 --> 01:10:28,509
How can we change that?

961
01:10:28,910 --> 01:10:31,132
Start by taking me to Bane.

962
01:10:33,773 --> 01:10:35,556
Your asked.

963
01:10:37,431 --> 01:10:39,702
From here, Bane's man patrol the tunnels...

964
01:10:39,903 --> 01:10:42,196
...and they're not your average brawlers.

965
01:10:42,838 --> 01:10:44,479
Neither am I.

966
01:10:52,265 --> 01:10:53,412
- He's behind you.
- Who?

967
01:10:53,690 --> 01:10:54,575
Me.

968
01:10:59,624 --> 01:11:01,009
Where do you think you're going?...

969
01:11:13,801 --> 01:11:15,567
Less a little bully.

970
01:11:23,053 --> 01:11:25,606
I had to find a way to stop
them trying to kill me.

971
01:11:25,914 --> 01:11:28,614
You made a serious mistake.

972
01:11:28,708 --> 01:11:31,431
Not as serious as yours...

973
01:11:31,908 --> 01:11:33,463
...I fear.

974
01:11:37,014 --> 01:11:37,934
Bane.

975
01:11:38,935 --> 01:11:41,815
Let's not stand on so moody here.

976
01:11:42,814 --> 01:11:45,797
Mr. Wayne.

977
01:11:56,515 --> 01:11:58,415
Peace has cost you your strength.

978
01:11:58,514 --> 01:12:00,992
Victory has defeated you.

979
01:13:02,587 --> 01:13:05,347
The adaptability and deception.

980
01:13:05,456 --> 01:13:07,886
Powerful agents to the uninitiated.

981
01:13:08,279 --> 01:13:11,930
But we are initiated aren't we, Bruce?

982
01:13:12,019 --> 01:13:14,690
Members of the League of Shadows.

983
01:13:16,854 --> 01:13:19,258
And you betrayed us.

984
01:13:20,239 --> 01:13:25,986
Yes.. You were excommunicated by 
a gang of psychopaths.

985
01:13:29,715 --> 01:13:33,021
I am, The League of Shadows.

986
01:13:33,117 --> 01:13:37,060
I'm here to full-fill Ra's Al Ghul's destiny!

987
01:13:49,961 --> 01:13:54,187
You fight like a younger man,
there's nothing held back.

988
01:13:54,532 --> 01:13:58,609
It's admirable, but mistaken.

989
01:14:02,198 --> 01:14:05,533
You think darkness is your ally?

990
01:14:05,926 --> 01:14:11,547
You've merely adopted the dark. 
I was born in it.

991
01:14:11,874 --> 01:14:14,677
Molded by it.

992
01:14:15,261 --> 01:14:18,448
I didn't see the light
until I was already a man...

993
01:14:18,772 --> 01:14:21,803
...by then was nothing to be blinded.

994
01:14:24,364 --> 01:14:28,865
Shadows betray you,
because they belong to me.

995
01:14:33,654 --> 01:14:37,059
I'll show you 
where I had made my home.

996
01:14:37,359 --> 01:14:40,552
Whilst preparing to bring justice.

997
01:14:42,896 --> 01:14:45,599
Then I will break you.

998
01:14:53,849 --> 01:14:55,663
Your precious armory.

999
01:14:55,864 --> 01:14:57,869
Great fully accepted.

1000
01:14:58,166 --> 01:14:59,970
We'll need it.

1001
01:15:08,731 --> 01:15:12,732
Oh. yes! 
I was wondering what would weight first.

1002
01:15:16,927 --> 01:15:18,614
Your spirit...

1003
01:15:23,088 --> 01:15:24,091
...or your body?

1004
01:16:08,900 --> 01:16:10,001
Get me Commissioner Gordon.

1005
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:12,201
I got a line up of Congressman's kidnapping.

1006
01:16:24,898 --> 01:16:26,299
- Excuse me, miss!
- Yes?

1007
01:16:26,399 --> 01:16:29,601
I'm going to need to see your
ticket and identification, please.

1008
01:16:29,901 --> 01:16:31,904
Do you mind?

1009
01:16:44,502 --> 01:16:47,401
I showed your picture to The Congressman. 
Guess what?

1010
01:16:47,801 --> 01:16:51,801
- Don't tell me... Still in love?
- Oh head over heels.

1011
01:16:52,001 --> 01:16:53,601
Pressing charges though.

1012
01:16:53,901 --> 01:16:57,600
You've made some mistakes, Miss Kyle.

1013
01:16:57,800 --> 01:17:01,395
- Girl's got to eat.
- And you have an appetite.

1014
01:17:01,695 --> 01:17:03,850
Why would run? You can't hide
from us with a record like this.

1015
01:17:04,098 --> 01:17:08,113
- Maybe it's not you I'm running from.
- Who then? Bane?

1016
01:17:08,412 --> 01:17:09,704
What do you know about him?

1017
01:17:11,212 --> 01:17:14,097
About you should be as afraid of him as I am?

1018
01:17:14,300 --> 01:17:16,200
You can offer you protection.

1019
01:17:19,701 --> 01:17:20,501
Okay.

1020
01:17:24,898 --> 01:17:29,300
When I spotted you, I was looking for
a friend of mine. Bruce Wayne.

1021
01:17:31,636 --> 01:17:33,438
Did that killed him?

1022
01:17:34,938 --> 01:17:37,138
I'm not sure.

1023
01:17:56,530 --> 01:17:58,489
Why didn't you just...

1024
01:18:00,190 --> 01:18:01,154
...kill me?

1025
01:18:01,389 --> 01:18:05,227
You don't fear death. 
you welcome it.

1026
01:18:05,428 --> 01:18:08,431
Your punishment must be mastered here.

1027
01:18:08,632 --> 01:18:10,777
You're the charger?

1028
01:18:11,178 --> 01:18:12,147
Yes.

1029
01:18:12,701 --> 01:18:14,523
But not of your body.

1030
01:18:18,614 --> 01:18:20,003
Of your soul.

1031
01:18:20,804 --> 01:18:22,579
Where am I ?

1032
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:24,692
Home.

1033
01:18:24,993 --> 01:18:27,419
Where I learned the truth about despair...

1034
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:30,082
...as will you.

1035
01:18:30,917 --> 01:18:34,616
There's a reason why this
prison were a hell on earth.

1036
01:18:35,317 --> 01:18:36,464
Hope.

1037
01:18:37,065 --> 01:18:40,079
Every man who has lotted here over
the centuries...

1038
01:18:40,180 --> 01:18:43,894
...looked up to the light 
and imagine climbing to freedom.

1039
01:18:44,495 --> 01:18:48,467
So easy... So simple.

1040
01:18:49,168 --> 01:18:55,320
Unless you break man turning into seawater 
for uncontrollably fast.

1041
01:18:56,770 --> 01:18:59,365
Many have died trying.

1042
01:18:59,566 --> 01:19:04,398
And then here can be no true despair 
without hope.

1043
01:19:04,699 --> 01:19:08,002
So, as I terrorize Gotham...

1044
01:19:08,221 --> 01:19:10,917
...I will feed it's deeper hole 
to poison their souls.

1045
01:19:12,418 --> 01:19:14,924
I would let them live so 
they can survived...

1046
01:19:15,225 --> 01:19:18,087
...so let you can watch them trampling 
over each other...

1047
01:19:18,288 --> 01:19:20,681
...to stay in the sun.

1048
01:19:23,940 --> 01:19:27,453
You could watch me torturing 
an entire city.

1049
01:19:27,654 --> 01:19:31,209
And then when you truly understood
the depth of your failure...

1050
01:19:31,610 --> 01:19:34,354
...we will fulfill Ra's Al Ghu's destiny.

1051
01:19:38,303 --> 01:19:40,428
We will destroy Gotham.

1052
01:19:41,246 --> 01:19:43,978
And then, what would you've...

1053
01:19:44,379 --> 01:19:46,353
...when Gotham is...

1054
01:19:47,554 --> 01:19:48,446
...ashes.

1055
01:19:54,929 --> 01:19:58,465
Then you have my permission to die.

1056
01:20:11,912 --> 01:20:13,637
You're locking her up in here?

1057
01:20:13,672 --> 01:20:17,355
The Dent act allowed non-segregation
based extraordinary needs.

1058
01:20:17,556 --> 01:20:20,405
First time she broke out of women correctional, 
she was 16.

1059
01:20:20,705 --> 01:20:22,056
Little closer, dear.

1060
01:20:22,357 --> 01:20:24,297
Why honey?
You want to hold my hand?

1061
01:20:25,381 --> 01:20:27,221
She's going to be fine.

1062
01:20:27,922 --> 01:20:31,228
I still don't see the need of a board meeting 
for the energy project.

1063
01:20:31,529 --> 01:20:32,801
Bruce got a lot of things right...

1064
01:20:32,902 --> 01:20:35,505
...keeping the board in the dark 
was not one of them.

1065
01:20:38,503 --> 01:20:43,060
Oh. Good of you to join us,
Chair President.

1066
01:20:43,361 --> 01:20:47,016
All I need now is one more
Ordinary Board member.

1067
01:20:47,085 --> 01:20:51,402
- Mr. Fox, would you like to nominate?
- No...

1068
01:20:52,103 --> 01:20:53,359
...I will volunteer.

1069
01:20:54,094 --> 01:20:55,458
Where are you taking us?

1070
01:21:06,382 --> 01:21:07,725
You were right, Commissioner.

1071
01:21:07,926 --> 01:21:09,210
Would you excuses us, please?

1072
01:21:09,511 --> 01:21:10,348
What happened?

1073
01:21:10,683 --> 01:21:12,490
Your mask man kidnapped the
Wayne Enterprise’s Board.

1074
01:21:12,831 --> 01:21:15,708
He let most of them go, but he took
three of them into the sewers.

1075
01:21:16,209 --> 01:21:18,111
No more patrols.
No more hide and seek.

1076
01:21:18,412 --> 01:21:21,138
Get every available cop down there 
and smoke him out!

1077
01:21:21,439 --> 01:21:22,569
The Mayor won't want panic.

1078
01:21:22,970 --> 01:21:24,809
So it's a training exercise?

1079
01:21:27,634 --> 01:21:29,755
I'm sorry, I didn't take you seriously.

1080
01:21:30,956 --> 01:21:34,354
Not you, you telling me The Batman 
have gone.

1081
01:21:34,555 --> 01:21:39,681
So you chase up the daggers
leads anyway you can.

1082
01:21:39,782 --> 01:21:41,230
Yes, sir.

1083
01:21:51,101 --> 01:21:56,554
He asks how much you would pay 
to let you die?

1084
01:21:56,755 --> 01:21:59,395
I told him... I told him
you have nothing.

1085
01:21:59,596 --> 01:22:01,021
You tell for the pleasure.

1086
01:22:01,222 --> 01:22:02,514
They pay me more than dead...

1087
01:22:02,815 --> 01:22:04,386
...to keep you alive.

1088
01:22:12,103 --> 01:22:14,014
He will try to climb.

1089
01:22:28,282 --> 01:22:31,095
Has anyone, every made it?

1090
01:22:31,396 --> 01:22:33,329
Well, Of course not.

1091
01:22:43,622 --> 01:22:46,415
He say there's one who did.

1092
01:22:46,816 --> 01:22:48,653
A child.

1093
01:22:49,946 --> 01:22:52,815
A child born in this hell.

1094
01:22:53,014 --> 01:22:53,952
Bane.

1095
01:22:54,653 --> 01:22:57,404
An old legend. Nothing more.

1096
01:23:02,619 --> 01:23:07,788
What they really tease me, you wanted to see, 
is happening soon.

1097
01:23:32,985 --> 01:23:34,754
Fire in the hole!

1098
01:24:02,827 --> 01:24:04,851
Turn it on!

1099
01:24:08,634 --> 01:24:13,156
I only need one other Board member,
there are eight others waiting.

1100
01:24:13,457 --> 01:24:14,655
I won't do it.

1101
01:24:15,431 --> 01:24:16,830
Alright stop!

1102
01:24:17,531 --> 01:24:20,492
Lucius, you will kill this man and yourself.

1103
01:24:20,893 --> 01:24:23,432
And you'll barely slow them down.

1104
01:24:48,763 --> 01:24:52,569
Go on then, do you work.

1105
01:24:54,772 --> 01:24:56,688
Take them up to the surface.

1106
01:24:56,889 --> 01:25:00,855
People of their status 
deserve to experience the next era...

1107
01:25:01,056 --> 01:25:04,066
...of Western civilization.

1108
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:10,207
I've been to half of Daggett's cement plants, 
some odd...

1109
01:25:10,408 --> 01:25:12,422
...location they pour for underground 
construction.

1110
01:25:12,623 --> 01:25:14,383
<i> Anything strange about the pouring? </i>

1111
01:25:15,384 --> 01:25:18,578
Honestly, Commissioner. I don't know
anything about civil engineering.

1112
01:25:18,779 --> 01:25:20,378
But you know about patterns.

1113
01:25:20,579 --> 01:25:21,835
<i>Keep looking!</i>

1114
01:25:27,204 --> 01:25:27,986
It's done.

1115
01:25:28,787 --> 01:25:32,374
This is now a four megatons nuclear bomb.

1116
01:25:33,897 --> 01:25:36,874
Pull the core out of the reactor.

1117
01:25:37,775 --> 01:25:39,941
No!... You cannot!

1118
01:25:40,342 --> 01:25:44,167
This is the only power source capable 
of sustaining it.

1119
01:25:44,468 --> 01:25:48,448
If you move it, the core will depleted 
in a matter of months.

1120
01:25:48,749 --> 01:25:52,936
- Five, by my calculations.
- It will go off!

1121
01:25:54,429 --> 01:25:58,400
And for the sake of your children Dr. Pavel...

1122
01:25:58,901 --> 01:26:00,802
...It did I hope it does.

1123
01:26:02,027 --> 01:26:02,579
Hey.

1124
01:26:02,904 --> 01:26:03,704
Hey!

1125
01:26:05,992 --> 01:26:08,873
That was you in front of
The Stock Exchange wasn't it?

1126
01:26:09,766 --> 01:26:10,853
When?

1127
01:26:12,189 --> 01:26:13,938
When half the city cops try to pull onto castle street...

1128
01:26:13,939 --> 01:26:15,624
...and your truck and your truck was 
shutting them out.

1129
01:26:16,578 --> 01:26:18,240
Oh yeah... you're the cop.

1130
01:26:18,341 --> 01:26:19,371
Detective.

1131
01:26:20,119 --> 01:26:24,103
And, As detective we're not allowed
to believe in coincidences.

1132
01:26:33,568 --> 01:26:36,327
What were you doing here?
What are you working on?

1133
01:26:44,088 --> 01:26:45,592
Commissioner, it's Blake.

1134
01:26:45,793 --> 01:26:49,497
I got two dead witnesses and a lot of questions. 
Call me when...

1135
01:26:50,368 --> 01:26:54,362
Wait a minute.
Four barrels of polisobutilen.

1136
01:26:55,843 --> 01:26:58,124
That looks like motor oil right next to it.

1137
01:26:58,394 --> 01:26:59,284
Jesus!

1138
01:27:00,016 --> 01:27:02,145
They're not making cement,
they're making explosive.

1139
01:27:09,235 --> 01:27:10,365
Patch me through Foley.

1140
01:27:10,766 --> 01:27:12,073
<i>Foley is overseeing the operation. </i>

1141
01:27:12,174 --> 01:27:14,059
They're heading into a trap.

1142
01:27:15,060 --> 01:27:17,307
We seeing literally thousand 
of police heading into the sewer.

1143
01:27:17,508 --> 01:27:19,055
Mr. Mayor, literally thousands of police...

1144
01:27:19,256 --> 01:27:21,268
It's just a training exercise. 
That's all.

1145
01:27:21,403 --> 01:27:22,543
Now, if you'll excuse me...

1146
01:27:22,544 --> 01:27:24,913
...I got tickets to watch our boys 
trash Rapid City.

1147
01:27:27,138 --> 01:27:27,781
Foley.

1148
01:27:28,278 --> 01:27:29,278
<i>It's a trap. Pull all of them out!</i>

1149
01:27:29,479 --> 01:27:32,101
Bane has been pour concrete rigs 
with explosives.

1150
01:27:32,402 --> 01:27:33,320
Where?

1151
01:27:49,570 --> 01:27:50,648
<i>There's a ring, surrounding the tunnels!</i>

1152
01:27:50,838 --> 01:27:52,927
<i>They're going to blow it 
and trap the cops underground!</i>

1153
01:27:54,351 --> 01:27:54,952
Pull 'em out.

1154
01:27:55,442 --> 01:27:56,835
Pull 'em out!... Now!

1155
01:28:21,251 --> 01:28:23,164
That's a lovely lovely voice.

1156
01:29:03,759 --> 01:29:06,275
Let the games begin.

1157
01:30:41,037 --> 01:30:42,065
Citizens!...

1158
01:30:44,190 --> 01:30:45,765
...Take control.

1159
01:30:47,086 --> 01:30:50,873
Take control of your city!

1160
01:30:55,039 --> 01:30:55,985
Foley ?.

1161
01:30:56,186 --> 01:30:56,959
Jesus, Blake!

1162
01:30:57,060 --> 01:30:59,976
Every cop in the city is down 
in those tunnels!

1163
01:31:00,577 --> 01:31:01,675
Not every cop.

1164
01:31:15,756 --> 01:31:19,099
Sir, Are you okay? I'm a police officer, 
I need your car right now.

1165
01:32:09,830 --> 01:32:11,578
Play the corners, rookie.

1166
01:32:13,379 --> 01:32:14,262
Get the coat, son!

1167
01:32:14,463 --> 01:32:20,970
This, this is the instrument
of your liberation.

1168
01:32:23,016 --> 01:32:24,958
Satellite show some radiation spike.

1169
01:32:26,159 --> 01:32:29,338
Whatever it is, it's nuclear.

1170
01:32:33,175 --> 01:32:36,760
Identify yourself to the world!

1171
01:32:37,682 --> 01:32:42,215
Dr. Leonid Pavel. Nuclear physicist.

1172
01:32:42,653 --> 01:32:45,479
Pavel was confirmed dead, 
plane crash on an...

1173
01:32:45,680 --> 01:32:50,930
...agency pull out of Uzbekistan but 
it looks like it's him.

1174
01:32:51,331 --> 01:32:53,888
And what, What is this?

1175
01:32:54,589 --> 01:33:01,209
It's a fully prime neutron bomb
with a blast radius of six miles.

1176
01:33:01,410 --> 01:33:05,844
And who is capable of disarming
such a device?

1177
01:33:07,455 --> 01:33:08,514
Only me.

1178
01:33:09,315 --> 01:33:10,725
Only you.

1179
01:33:12,081 --> 01:33:14,118
Thank you. Good doctor.

1180
01:33:16,816 --> 01:33:19,838
Now, this bomb is armed.

1181
01:33:20,139 --> 01:33:27,139
This bomb is mobile and the identity
of the trigger man is a mystery.

1182
01:33:27,938 --> 01:33:32,571
For one of you holds the detonator.

1183
01:33:32,872 --> 01:33:35,742
Now we came here not as conquerors...

1184
01:33:36,543 --> 01:33:41,513
...but liberators to return control of this
city to the people.

1185
01:33:43,365 --> 01:33:47,949
At the first sight of interference
of the outside world...

1186
01:33:48,650 --> 01:33:53,203
...or to those people attempting to flee.

1187
01:33:54,437 --> 01:33:56,754
This anonymous Gotham-might.

1188
01:33:57,355 --> 01:34:02,212
This unsung hero will trigger the bomb.

1189
01:34:03,977 --> 01:34:06,971
<i>And now, Martial Law is in effect.</i>

1190
01:34:07,472 --> 01:34:09,776
Return to your homes...

1191
01:34:10,677 --> 01:34:15,568
...hold your families close and wait.

1192
01:34:16,169 --> 01:34:19,891
Tomorrow you claim
what is rightfully yours.

1193
01:34:25,667 --> 01:34:27,080
Hold back the fighters.

1194
01:34:28,181 --> 01:34:30,269
Start high level reconnaissance flights.

1195
01:34:31,170 --> 01:34:33,805
Get the president on the line.

1196
01:34:53,921 --> 01:34:57,941
<i>Tanks and planes cannot stop us 
from detonating our device.</i>

1197
01:34:58,342 --> 01:35:00,458
<i> Send a negotiator to discuss term...</i>

1198
01:35:00,759 --> 01:35:03,726
<i>...of access to supplies and communication.</i>

1199
01:35:09,277 --> 01:35:10,867
How many of you are there, Son?

1200
01:35:13,009 --> 01:35:14,765
You don't have enough man to stop...

1201
01:35:14,766 --> 01:35:17,089
...twelve million people from
leaving this island.

1202
01:35:17,189 --> 01:35:19,455
No... No we don't.

1203
01:35:20,323 --> 01:35:21,314
But you do.

1204
01:35:22,743 --> 01:35:25,857
Why the hell would I try help
you to keep your hostages?

1205
01:35:26,258 --> 01:35:28,841
If one person crosses this bridge...

1206
01:35:29,342 --> 01:35:31,119
...Gotham gets blown to hell.

1207
01:35:37,001 --> 01:35:39,793
<i>The people of our greatest
city are resilient.</i>

1208
01:35:40,796 --> 01:35:45,110
<i> They have proven this before
and they will prove it again. </i>

1209
01:35:46,511 --> 01:35:49,231
<i> We do not negotiate with terrorists. </i>

1210
01:35:50,032 --> 01:35:52,374
<i> But we do recognize realities. </i>

1211
01:35:52,975 --> 01:35:59,656
<i>As this situation develops, one thing
must be understood above all others.</i>

1212
01:36:00,557 --> 01:36:03,769
<i> People of Gotham,
we have not abandoned you. </i>

1213
01:36:04,070 --> 01:36:05,300
What does that mean?

1214
01:36:06,601 --> 01:36:08,368
It means we're on our own.

1215
01:36:08,869 --> 01:36:10,590
I have to get in front of a camera.

1216
01:36:10,991 --> 01:36:13,723
Well sir, they will kill you the second 
you show your face.

1217
01:36:14,024 --> 01:36:16,930
Bane says he's giving Gotham
back to the people.

1218
01:36:17,030 --> 01:36:18,355
They need to know I could lead.

1219
01:36:18,356 --> 01:36:20,021
Bane is not going to let that happen.

1220
01:36:20,022 --> 01:36:23,403
- Then he will show his true colors.
- And you'd be dead.

1221
01:36:41,779 --> 01:36:46,487
Behind you, stand a symbol of oppression.

1222
01:36:47,608 --> 01:36:51,256
Blackgate Prison,
where a thousand men has...

1223
01:36:51,857 --> 01:36:56,071
...languished under the name 
of this man...

1224
01:36:56,626 --> 01:36:58,399
Harvey Dent.

1225
01:36:59,834 --> 01:37:06,626
Who has been held to you as
the shinning example of justice.

1226
01:37:06,827 --> 01:37:09,300
We're just keep moving you until we
can get you in front of a camera.

1227
01:37:09,501 --> 01:37:12,406
You have been supplied with a false idol...

1228
01:37:12,807 --> 01:37:17,101
...to stop you tearing down 
this corrupt city!

1229
01:37:17,702 --> 01:37:21,846
Let me tell you the truth
about Harvey Dent.

1230
01:37:22,147 --> 01:37:26,594
From the words, 
of Gotham Police Commissioner.

1231
01:37:27,529 --> 01:37:28,847
<i>James Gordon.</i>

1232
01:37:29,848 --> 01:37:35,401
"The Batman didn't murdered Harvey
Dent, he saved my boy."

1233
01:37:35,802 --> 01:37:39,804
"Then took the blame for
Harvey's appalling crimes,"...

1234
01:37:39,805 --> 01:37:42,985
..."So that I could threw my shame,"...

1235
01:37:42,986 --> 01:37:49,982
..."build a lie around this fallen idol."

1236
01:37:51,419 --> 01:37:56,890
"I praised the mad man who tried 
to kill my own child,"...

1237
01:37:57,091 --> 01:38:00,858
..."But I can no longer live with my lie."

1238
01:38:01,059 --> 01:38:05,024
..."It is time to trust The people of Gotham 
with the truth"...

1239
01:38:05,225 --> 01:38:09,379
..."And it is time for me to resign."

1240
01:38:09,680 --> 01:38:13,804
And do you accept this man resignation?

1241
01:38:15,283 --> 01:38:19,712
And do you accept the
resignations of all these liars...

1242
01:38:20,013 --> 01:38:21,818
...of all the corrupt?

1243
01:38:25,136 --> 01:38:27,529
Those men locked up for eight
years at Blackgate.

1244
01:38:27,730 --> 01:38:31,178
With denied parole under the
Dent act based on a lie?

1245
01:38:32,181 --> 01:38:34,141
Gotham needed a hero.

1246
01:38:34,742 --> 01:38:38,915
It needs it now more than ever.
You betrayed everything you stood for.

1247
01:38:40,578 --> 01:38:42,547
What's the point?

1248
01:38:43,540 --> 01:38:46,189
Far out there when the
structures failing...

1249
01:38:46,590 --> 01:38:48,859
...and on the road, weapons city 
more than...

1250
01:38:50,379 --> 01:38:51,282
...shackles.

1251
01:38:51,698 --> 01:38:53,526
Letting the bad guy getting hit.

1252
01:38:55,060 --> 01:38:56,219
One day...

1253
01:38:57,720 --> 01:39:00,912
...you may face such a moment of crisis.
And it that moment...

1254
01:39:01,313 --> 01:39:03,440
...I hope you have a friend like I did.

1255
01:39:04,441 --> 01:39:07,168
To plunge their hands into the filth.

1256
01:39:07,669 --> 01:39:10,315
So that you can keep yours clean.

1257
01:39:11,634 --> 01:39:14,099
Your hands looks funny-filthy to me, Commissioner.

1258
01:39:15,900 --> 01:39:19,478
We take Gotham from the corrupt.

1259
01:39:21,426 --> 01:39:22,504
The rich.

1260
01:39:23,005 --> 01:39:29,346
The oppressors who for generation has get you down 
with myth of opportunity...

1261
01:39:29,647 --> 01:39:32,237
...and we give it back to you.

1262
01:39:33,562 --> 01:39:34,728
The people.

1263
01:39:36,729 --> 01:39:38,345
Gotham is yours.

1264
01:39:39,480 --> 01:39:42,677
None shall interfered.
Do as you pleased.

1265
01:39:44,078 --> 01:39:49,364
And start by storming Blackgate.
And freeing the oppressed!

1266
01:39:57,917 --> 01:40:00,678
Step forward those who would serve.

1267
01:40:02,662 --> 01:40:04,984
To an army, a world will be raised.

1268
01:40:08,527 --> 01:40:13,332
The powerful will be ripped from their 
decadent years...

1269
01:40:17,328 --> 01:40:23,452
...and cast out into the cold world
that we know and endure.

1270
01:40:27,814 --> 01:40:31,256
Courts will be convened.

1271
01:40:37,497 --> 01:40:41,062
Spoils will be enjoyed.

1272
01:40:44,784 --> 01:40:46,950
Blood will be shed.

1273
01:40:49,810 --> 01:40:52,866
The Police will survive...

1274
01:40:52,966 --> 01:40:56,858
...as they learn to serve
true justice...

1275
01:40:58,459 --> 01:41:00,747
This great city...

1276
01:41:02,696 --> 01:41:06,030
...it will endure.

1277
01:41:07,033 --> 01:41:11,096
Gotham will survive.

1278
01:41:32,107 --> 01:41:35,024
He says you must first
fix your back.

1279
01:41:35,325 --> 01:41:36,333
How does he know?

1280
01:41:36,634 --> 01:41:39,733
He was the prison doctor.
A morphine addict.

1281
01:41:40,034 --> 01:41:43,785
When heard of this pleasure
of powerful evil.

1282
01:41:44,086 --> 01:41:46,485
Including your mask friend.

1283
01:41:47,086 --> 01:41:48,525
How?

1284
01:41:49,673 --> 01:41:51,183
Many years ago...

1285
01:41:51,684 --> 01:41:53,797
...it was a time of plague.

1286
01:41:55,132 --> 01:41:59,276
Some of the other
prisoners attacked Bane.

1287
01:42:00,574 --> 01:42:04,363
The Doctor humbling attempt
to rebuild the damage...

1288
01:42:05,170 --> 01:42:06,564
...left him in perpetual agony.

1289
01:42:06,965 --> 01:42:09,858
The Mask hold the pain at bay.

1290
01:42:10,359 --> 01:42:15,462
Bane, was the child who struck out?
He was born here?

1291
01:42:15,963 --> 01:42:20,475
Legend is that it was a mercenary
who worked for a local warlord.

1292
01:42:20,776 --> 01:42:23,841
They felt in love with the
warlord's daughter.

1293
01:42:24,142 --> 01:42:28,107
They were married in secret.
But the warlord found out.

1294
01:42:28,208 --> 01:42:32,226
The mercenary was condemned to this pit.

1295
01:42:32,827 --> 01:42:35,049
But then he exiled him instead.

1296
01:42:35,750 --> 01:42:38,814
The mess I understood that it was the
daughter who secure his release.

1297
01:42:39,215 --> 01:42:41,825
But what he could not know...

1298
01:42:42,126 --> 01:42:44,528
...was the true price of his freedom.

1299
01:42:45,129 --> 01:42:48,884
She took his place in the pit.

1300
01:42:50,123 --> 01:42:54,306
And she was with child,
the mercenary child.

1301
01:42:56,101 --> 01:43:00,618
Innocence cannot flower underground,
it has to be stem out ...

1302
01:43:02,160 --> 01:43:03,795
One day...

1303
01:43:05,396 --> 01:43:08,100
...the doctor forgot to lock the cell.

1304
01:43:14,759 --> 01:43:16,699
But the child had a friend.

1305
01:43:18,100 --> 01:43:18,745
 a protector.

1306
01:43:19,746 --> 01:43:23,458
Who showed the others that this
innocence was their redemption.

1307
01:43:23,559 --> 01:43:24,769
It was to be priced.

1308
01:43:25,170 --> 01:43:27,395
The mother was not so lucky.

1309
01:43:29,880 --> 01:43:34,266
This is Bane's prison now.
It wouldn't want this story told.

1310
01:43:45,136 --> 01:43:46,604
There's a vertebra.

1311
01:43:47,005 --> 01:43:48,587
Protruding from your back.

1312
01:43:49,188 --> 01:43:51,762
It has to be put back.

1313
01:43:56,478 --> 01:43:59,124
Stay like this until you stand.

1314
01:44:08,362 --> 01:44:11,666
Did you not think I would
return, Bruce?

1315
01:44:17,684 --> 01:44:20,431
I told you I was immortal.

1316
01:44:21,929 --> 01:44:24,188
I watched you... I watched you die.

1317
01:44:24,521 --> 01:44:27,366
Owh... they're many forms of immortality.

1318
01:44:29,114 --> 01:44:30,890
Once I had a wife.

1319
01:44:32,191 --> 01:44:33,746
My great love.

1320
01:44:35,062 --> 01:44:37,179
She was taken from me.

1321
01:44:37,580 --> 01:44:40,070
You were the mercenary.

1322
01:44:42,430 --> 01:44:46,993
Bane is your child, your heir.

1323
01:44:47,328 --> 01:44:50,113
I'm here to ensure
The League of Shadow fulfills...

1324
01:44:50,114 --> 01:44:52,912
...it's duty to restore balance to civilization.

1325
01:44:54,047 --> 01:44:57,541
You yourself fought the decadence
of Gotham for years.

1326
01:44:57,842 --> 01:44:59,610
With all your strength...

1327
01:45:00,111 --> 01:45:01,780
...all your resources...

1328
01:45:02,181 --> 01:45:04,342
...all your moral authority.

1329
01:45:05,006 --> 01:45:08,181
And the only victory you
achieved was a lie.

1330
01:45:08,882 --> 01:45:09,994
Now, you understand?

1331
01:45:10,295 --> 01:45:11,960
Gotham is beyond saving.

1332
01:45:12,561 --> 01:45:14,296
And must be allowed to die.

1333
01:45:14,621 --> 01:45:15,521
No!

1334
01:45:31,810 --> 01:45:33,118
No... No!

1335
01:46:08,264 --> 01:46:08,807
What's that?

1336
01:46:09,008 --> 01:46:10,192
This was someone's home.

1337
01:46:10,493 --> 01:46:12,714
Now, it's everyone's home.

1338
01:46:13,915 --> 01:46:17,904
There's storm coming remember?
That is what we wanted.

1339
01:46:46,324 --> 01:46:49,174
It's for the bus, in case
there's a chance to evacuate.

1340
01:46:49,575 --> 01:46:51,086
Any news, from the Commissioner?

1341
01:46:51,387 --> 01:46:52,830
The less you know father.

1342
01:46:52,965 --> 01:46:54,518
How are the boys doing?

1343
01:46:54,553 --> 01:46:57,510
Well we had more power on,
so they get some TV.

1344
01:46:57,911 --> 01:46:59,206
It's good to see you, Father.

1345
01:46:59,707 --> 01:47:01,020
Hey Blake, you be careful out there.

1346
01:47:01,421 --> 01:47:03,982
They hunting down cops like a dog.

1347
01:47:09,291 --> 01:47:11,116
Why build yourself?

1348
01:47:13,017 --> 01:47:14,298
I'm not meant to die in here.

1349
01:47:14,533 --> 01:47:19,012
Here or there, what's the difference?

1350
01:48:19,716 --> 01:48:22,838
I told you it can't be done.

1351
01:48:23,139 --> 01:48:25,689
You told me a child did it.

1352
01:48:25,990 --> 01:48:28,404
But no ordinary child.

1353
01:48:29,005 --> 01:48:32,156
A child born in hell.

1354
01:48:35,873 --> 01:48:38,089
Forged from suffering.

1355
01:48:39,371 --> 01:48:42,058
Harden by pain.

1356
01:48:42,659 --> 01:48:46,185
Not a man from privileged.

1357
01:49:05,300 --> 01:49:07,169
We got blues in the ground, Sir.

1358
01:49:07,870 --> 01:49:09,529
Just waiting on intel.

1359
01:49:14,416 --> 01:49:15,713
Do you have ID?

1360
01:49:16,814 --> 01:49:17,393
Of course, Not.

1361
01:49:17,794 --> 01:49:18,660
How can we trust you?

1362
01:49:18,861 --> 01:49:20,203
We don't have any choice.

1363
01:49:20,904 --> 01:49:23,017
Commissioner Gordon.
Captain Jones, Special Forces.

1364
01:49:23,218 --> 01:49:24,781
Captain, glad to have you here.

1365
01:49:25,082 --> 01:49:25,977
It's our job sir.

1366
01:49:26,178 --> 01:49:27,914
Now how many are all you are they?

1367
01:49:28,215 --> 01:49:30,689
Well there's dozen, 
I rather not say exactly.

1368
01:49:30,890 --> 01:49:33,895
The man trapped underground,
numbered almost 3,000.

1369
01:49:34,196 --> 01:49:36,250
- What kind of condition are they in?
- They been getting in food and water.

1370
01:49:36,351 --> 01:49:37,898
- Can we break them out?
- Yes, sir.

1371
01:49:38,099 --> 01:49:41,337
Take out the mercenaries guarding the
outflows south of Ackerman Park...

1372
01:49:41,338 --> 01:49:44,243
...blow the rubble, we can make a hole big 
enough for 10 at a time.

1373
01:49:44,844 --> 01:49:47,917
I'm in contact with my partner down there.
They're just waiting for the day.

1374
01:49:48,218 --> 01:49:49,617
Commander, they haven't seen
daylight for three months.

1375
01:49:49,918 --> 01:49:52,476
Police officers who haven't seen
daylight in three months.

1376
01:49:52,477 --> 01:49:53,273
What about the bomb?

1377
01:49:53,374 --> 01:49:55,494
The satellite can't pick up
any radiation hot spots.

1378
01:49:55,595 --> 01:49:58,419
They keep it on a truck.
It must have lead lined roof.

1379
01:49:58,720 --> 01:50:01,481
- They're moving constantly.
- Good, so you know the truck?

1380
01:50:01,682 --> 01:50:05,135
Well it's one of the three.
We've been tracking it.

1381
01:50:05,461 --> 01:50:06,759
Decoy.

1382
01:50:07,974 --> 01:50:09,943
You're not really think
he's coming back, do you?

1383
01:50:09,944 --> 01:50:11,085
Doesn't matter what I think.

1384
01:50:11,086 --> 01:50:15,304
Actually it does. You should put
your faith in something more real.

1385
01:50:15,305 --> 01:50:17,549
But the routes don't vary much.

1386
01:50:17,550 --> 01:50:20,982
- What about the trigger man?
- No leads. It's a bluff.

1387
01:50:20,983 --> 01:50:23,543
Bane wouldn't gave control
on that to someone else.

1388
01:50:23,544 --> 01:50:24,872
We can't take that chance.

1389
01:50:24,907 --> 01:50:27,469
Until we have the trigger
man, we just track the device.

1390
01:50:27,470 --> 01:50:30,264
And mean while, Gotham
lives under a warlord?

1391
01:50:30,265 --> 01:50:31,644
Like some failed state?

1392
01:50:31,645 --> 01:50:34,658
Dialed it back, officer.
The situation is unprecedented.

1393
01:50:34,659 --> 01:50:36,718
We can't do anything to risk million of lives.

1394
01:50:36,719 --> 01:50:40,102
Can't you tell? Aren't you going to
tell them what actually is going on?

1395
01:50:40,103 --> 01:50:43,627
Captain, the situation is more
complicated than you think.

1396
01:50:43,628 --> 01:50:45,709
There's someone you need to meet.

1397
01:50:45,710 --> 01:50:48,141
Came up stairs looking for 
a vantage point.

1398
01:50:48,142 --> 01:50:50,537
Found the people who runs the
corporation living up here.

1399
01:50:50,538 --> 01:50:51,280
What corporation?

1400
01:50:51,281 --> 01:50:53,213
Wayne Enterprises.

1401
01:51:02,888 --> 01:51:05,080
Mr. Fox would you like
to brief the captain?

1402
01:51:05,081 --> 01:51:07,876
Mrs. Tate is fully aware
of the situation.

1403
01:51:07,877 --> 01:51:12,417
And a CEO of Wayne Enterprises,
I have to take responsibility for it.

1404
01:51:12,418 --> 01:51:14,643
- Why?
- We built it.

1405
01:51:14,644 --> 01:51:16,156
You built the bomb?

1406
01:51:16,157 --> 01:51:20,532
It was build as a fussion reactor.
First of it's kind

1407
01:51:20,567 --> 01:51:24,209
Bane turned the core into a bomb,
and remove it from the reactor.

1408
01:51:24,210 --> 01:51:25,426
That's the important part.

1409
01:51:25,427 --> 01:51:27,820
As the device's fuel cells deteriorates...

1410
01:51:27,821 --> 01:51:31,611
...it becomes increasingly unstable
to the point of detonation.

1411
01:51:31,612 --> 01:51:33,271
This bomb is a time bomb.

1412
01:51:33,472 --> 01:51:35,511
And it will go off in 23 days.

1413
01:51:35,812 --> 01:51:38,103
Regardless of the Bane's revolution 
or what we...

1414
01:51:38,204 --> 01:51:40,322
...and the outside world 
choose to do.

1415
01:51:40,623 --> 01:51:43,379
Your peace-man plan may not be
as practical as you thought.

1416
01:51:43,580 --> 01:51:44,608
Could you disarm it?

1417
01:51:44,750 --> 01:51:45,989
I could reconnect to the reactor.

1418
01:51:47,090 --> 01:51:47,856
To stabilize it.

1419
01:51:47,957 --> 01:51:50,236
Let's move away from this
location and call it in.

1420
01:51:50,237 --> 01:51:51,040
Alright let's go!

1421
01:51:51,041 --> 01:51:54,661
Let me take it from here.
You stay and look after these folks.

1422
01:52:01,670 --> 01:52:03,473
Someone sold us out.

1423
01:52:27,478 --> 01:52:30,046
I'd die before I talk.

1424
01:52:30,047 --> 01:52:33,044
How about your schedule, Captain.

1425
01:52:39,254 --> 01:52:40,989
There were people living upstairs.

1426
01:52:41,990 --> 01:52:44,206
Round them up for judgment.

1427
01:52:48,015 --> 01:52:49,749
And hang them...

1428
01:52:50,550 --> 01:52:52,950
...where the world to see.

1429
01:53:07,634 --> 01:53:12,036
He says that the leap of
freedom is not about strength.

1430
01:53:12,137 --> 01:53:13,794
My body makes the jump.

1431
01:53:14,295 --> 01:53:17,964
Surviving is spirit, the soul.

1432
01:53:21,231 --> 01:53:24,100
My soul, is it ready to escape 
with my body?

1433
01:53:24,401 --> 01:53:26,775
Feel is why you afraid?

1434
01:53:27,376 --> 01:53:29,294
No, I'm not afraid.

1435
01:53:30,867 --> 01:53:32,641
I'm angry.

1436
01:54:02,020 --> 01:54:02,964
Bruce.

1437
01:54:04,194 --> 01:54:06,488
Why did we fall?

1438
01:54:11,497 --> 01:54:13,244
You do not fear death.

1439
01:54:14,045 --> 01:54:16,169
You think this makes you strong?

1440
01:54:17,380 --> 01:54:18,579
It makes you weak.

1441
01:54:19,452 --> 01:54:20,444
Why?

1442
01:54:20,845 --> 01:54:22,961
How can you move faster than possible?

1443
01:54:23,362 --> 01:54:25,577
Fight longer than possible?

1444
01:54:25,878 --> 01:54:29,941
Without the most powerful
impulse left in you.

1445
01:54:30,242 --> 01:54:32,094
The fear of death.

1446
01:54:33,095 --> 01:54:34,806
I fear death.

1447
01:54:36,207 --> 01:54:38,405
I fear dying in here...

1448
01:54:39,306 --> 01:54:41,179
...all my city burns...

1449
01:54:42,380 --> 01:54:44,857
...there's no one there to save it.

1450
01:54:45,821 --> 01:54:48,418
And then make the climb.

1451
01:54:52,622 --> 01:54:53,928
How?

1452
01:54:55,241 --> 01:54:57,232
As the child did.

1453
01:55:01,582 --> 01:55:03,751
Without the rope.

1454
01:55:05,552 --> 01:55:08,342
That fear will fight you again.

1455
01:55:15,142 --> 01:55:19,559
Ah surprise for your journey,
that's wonderful.

1456
01:55:24,583 --> 01:55:25,968
What does that mean?

1457
01:55:26,669 --> 01:55:27,684
Rise.

1458
01:55:29,216 --> 01:55:30,685
No.

1459
01:57:00,380 --> 01:57:01,955
There's been a mistake.

1460
01:57:02,656 --> 01:57:04,236
Take me to Bane!

1461
01:57:06,796 --> 01:57:08,218
Where's Bane?

1462
01:57:14,509 --> 01:57:15,578
Where's Bane?

1463
01:57:15,779 --> 01:57:18,147
There's no mistake Mr. Stryver.

1464
01:57:18,448 --> 01:57:20,298
You are Philip Stryver.

1465
01:57:20,599 --> 01:57:24,199
Executive Vice President of
Daggett Industries...

1466
01:57:24,500 --> 01:57:27,469
...who for years has been living 
off the blood and...

1467
01:57:27,470 --> 01:57:30,305
...sweat 
of people less powerful than him.

1468
01:57:30,506 --> 01:57:31,484
Call, Bane.

1469
01:57:31,785 --> 01:57:34,084
I am one of you.

1470
01:57:34,085 --> 01:57:37,838
Bane has no authority here.
This is merely a sentencing hearing.

1471
01:57:38,139 --> 01:57:41,890
Now chooses yours, 
exile or death?

1472
01:57:42,355 --> 01:57:46,955
Death!... Death!...

1473
01:57:49,072 --> 01:57:50,220
Ex... Exile.

1474
01:57:51,421 --> 01:57:52,062
Sold.

1475
01:57:52,363 --> 01:57:55,114
The man of the cold sweat.

1476
01:58:01,821 --> 01:58:05,648
You follow the thick ice. If you
try to swim, you're dead in minutes.

1477
01:58:05,949 --> 01:58:07,149
So no one made it?

1478
01:58:21,164 --> 01:58:21,909
Where the hell are they?

1479
01:58:22,110 --> 01:58:23,602
It's not like we have a lot of time here.

1480
01:58:23,803 --> 01:58:24,497
How long?

1481
01:58:24,998 --> 01:58:26,534
The bomb goes off tomorrow.

1482
01:58:26,835 --> 01:58:28,956
We have about 18 hours to do something.

1483
01:58:29,157 --> 01:58:29,852
To do what?

1484
01:58:29,853 --> 01:58:31,723
To mark the truck. Get a GPS...

1485
01:58:31,724 --> 01:58:34,423
...on it so we can start to figure out 
how to bring it down.

1486
01:58:40,948 --> 01:58:42,136
That's it?

1487
01:58:44,734 --> 01:58:45,854
Foley.

1488
01:58:47,348 --> 01:58:49,140
Where is Foley? Damn it!

1489
01:58:50,041 --> 01:58:51,507
You shouldn't be out in the streets.

1490
01:58:56,090 --> 01:58:56,949
Jim, he's not here.

1491
01:58:57,150 --> 01:59:01,982
You let your wife come to the door,
when the city is under occupation?

1492
01:59:02,217 --> 01:59:05,374
What did you do? Bury your
uniform in the backyard?

1493
01:59:05,575 --> 01:59:07,521
You saw what they
did to the special forces.

1494
01:59:07,722 --> 01:59:09,772
Have you forgotten all the years
we were out on patrolled?

1495
01:59:09,973 --> 01:59:12,764
When every gang banger want to plant
one as soon as our back are turned?

1496
01:59:12,765 --> 01:59:14,582
Now is different and you know it.

1497
01:59:14,983 --> 01:59:17,148
This guys run the city. 
The government is done a deal with them.

1498
01:59:17,149 --> 01:59:19,891
Bane's got their balls on the ice 
that's not a deal.

1499
01:59:20,092 --> 01:59:23,097
If you move on Bane, the trigger-man
is going to hit the button.

1500
01:59:23,298 --> 01:59:26,865
Do you think he's given control
of that bomb to one of the people?

1501
01:59:27,666 --> 01:59:29,974
You think this apart of some revolutions?

1502
01:59:30,275 --> 01:59:32,683
There's only one man with his
finger on the button, that's Bane.

1503
01:59:32,884 --> 01:59:35,860
Look. We all got to keep our heads
down until they can fix this.

1504
01:59:36,061 --> 01:59:37,085
If you had family here...

1505
01:59:37,186 --> 01:59:40,535
That's only get fix from inside the city!

1506
01:59:41,691 --> 01:59:42,598
Look Peter...

1507
01:59:44,399 --> 01:59:47,582
...I'm not asking you to walk down grand in
you dress rules...

1508
01:59:47,882 --> 01:59:48,988
...but something has to be done.

1509
01:59:49,089 --> 01:59:51,173
- I'm sorry, Jim. I gotta...
- Keep your head down..

1510
01:59:51,174 --> 01:59:53,515
...What's good that going to do tomorrow 
when that thing blows.

1511
01:59:54,016 --> 01:59:55,696
You don't know that's a happens.

1512
02:00:00,430 --> 02:00:02,776
I hear you're looking for men, Commissioner?

1513
02:00:02,977 --> 02:00:03,949
How about me instead?

1514
02:00:04,250 --> 02:00:07,649
Miss. Tate, I ehm...
I can't ask do do that.

1515
02:00:08,350 --> 02:00:09,228
Please.

1516
02:00:12,087 --> 02:00:12,598
What you did?

1517
02:00:12,899 --> 02:00:13,587
Nothing.

1518
02:00:14,112 --> 02:00:15,143
I didn't take anything.

1519
02:00:15,444 --> 02:00:18,208
You steal from us?... Little bastard ?!

1520
02:00:19,138 --> 02:00:21,338
Now you boys know you
can't come in my neighborhood...

1521
02:00:21,339 --> 02:00:23,338
...without asking politely.

1522
02:00:29,028 --> 02:00:33,250
Never steal anything from
someone you can't outrun, kid!

1523
02:00:38,562 --> 02:00:41,074
Pretty generous for a thief.

1524
02:00:49,588 --> 02:00:51,067
I thought they killed you.

1525
02:00:51,668 --> 02:00:52,358
Not yet.

1526
02:00:52,559 --> 02:00:55,684
- If you expecting an apology...
- I wouldn't suit you.

1527
02:00:56,985 --> 02:00:58,181
I need your help.

1528
02:00:58,582 --> 02:01:02,464
- And why would I help you?
- For this, "Clean Slate".

1529
02:01:02,665 --> 02:01:04,352
You trust me with that...

1530
02:01:04,753 --> 02:01:06,811
...after what I did to you?

1531
02:01:07,112 --> 02:01:09,789
I admit I was a little let down.

1532
02:01:11,547 --> 02:01:13,217
But I still think
there more to you.

1533
02:01:13,418 --> 02:01:16,500
In fact that, I think that.
For you, this isn't just a tool.

1534
02:01:16,501 --> 02:01:20,023
It's an escape route you want
to disappear, start fresh.

1535
02:01:20,724 --> 02:01:22,349
I couldn't even get off this island.

1536
02:01:22,550 --> 02:01:25,358
I could give you a way off once
you to get me to Lucius Fox.

1537
02:01:25,559 --> 02:01:29,221
I need you to find out where they're
holding him and take me in.

1538
02:01:32,065 --> 02:01:33,127
Why do you need Fox?

1539
02:01:33,328 --> 02:01:34,332
To save the city.

1540
02:01:34,533 --> 02:01:37,705
Who says it needs saving?
Maybe I like it this way.

1541
02:01:37,906 --> 02:01:39,586
Maybe you do.

1542
02:01:40,587 --> 02:01:43,292
But tomorrow that bomb is going off.

1543
02:01:45,590 --> 02:01:47,494
Get your powerful friend 
on the case?

1544
02:01:47,795 --> 02:01:50,555
I'm trying. 
But I need Fox.

1545
02:01:51,821 --> 02:01:55,067
Once it approaches, flick the switch.

1546
02:01:55,368 --> 02:01:57,539
The needle hit 200, you
give me the signal.

1547
02:01:57,940 --> 02:01:59,634
I'll will mark truck. Okay?

1548
02:02:00,430 --> 02:02:02,002
Heads up!... Heads up!

1549
02:02:18,296 --> 02:02:18,941
I got it!

1550
02:02:19,542 --> 02:02:20,402
Mercenaries at your 6.

1551
02:02:20,603 --> 02:02:24,144
Stand still! Keep your hands
where we can see them!

1552
02:02:25,774 --> 02:02:27,625
Commissioner Gordon,
you're under arrest.

1553
02:02:28,126 --> 02:02:29,735
On who's authority?

1554
02:02:29,836 --> 02:02:31,233
People of Gotham.

1555
02:02:32,034 --> 02:02:36,936
No lawyer. No witnesses.
What sort of due process is this?

1556
02:02:37,137 --> 02:02:40,844
You guilt have been determined.
This is merely a sentencing hearing.

1557
02:02:40,845 --> 02:02:42,184
Now what will it be?

1558
02:02:43,285 --> 02:02:46,246
Death or exile?

1559
02:02:46,347 --> 02:02:50,930
Crane, if you think we're going
out on that ice willingly...

1560
02:02:51,431 --> 02:02:53,215
...you have another thing coming.

1561
02:02:55,894 --> 02:02:56,638
Death then.

1562
02:02:56,939 --> 02:02:57,864
Looks that way.

1563
02:02:58,265 --> 02:03:01,700
Very well. Death!

1564
02:03:02,301 --> 02:03:03,865
By exile.

1565
02:03:06,493 --> 02:03:08,960
Bring her to me.

1566
02:03:15,092 --> 02:03:16,892
Hey. Going down. Get things ready.

1567
02:03:17,117 --> 02:03:19,117
Let's gear on.

1568
02:03:26,291 --> 02:03:28,098
Spot this one on the spot.
Got a big day tomorrow.

1569
02:03:28,395 --> 02:03:31,191
We all do. Not everyday
bag Bruce Wayne.

1570
02:03:33,890 --> 02:03:34,304
Bruce?

1571
02:03:34,505 --> 02:03:35,302
You okay?

1572
02:03:35,503 --> 02:03:37,608
You pick the hell of time to go 
on vacation, Mr. Wayne.

1573
02:03:37,909 --> 02:03:39,403
How long until that core ignites?

1574
02:03:39,704 --> 02:03:41,384
That bomb goes off in 12 hours.

1575
02:03:41,585 --> 02:03:44,053
Unless we can reconnect
it to the reactor.

1576
02:03:44,254 --> 02:03:48,024
- Can you get Miranda out of here?
- Not tonight. I'm sorry.

1577
02:03:48,025 --> 02:03:49,043
Do what necessary.

1578
02:03:49,344 --> 02:03:50,659
Tonight I need you.

1579
02:03:50,860 --> 02:03:51,256
What for?

1580
02:03:51,457 --> 02:03:52,737
To get me back in the game.

1581
02:03:53,138 --> 02:03:57,696
Sorry, to spoil things boys but
they want these guys to themselves.

1582
02:03:59,666 --> 02:04:01,634
I won't forget about us, Miranda.

1583
02:04:02,135 --> 02:04:02,820
I know.

1584
02:04:11,774 --> 02:04:15,388
- I like your girlfriend, Mr. Wayne!
- He should be so lucky.

1585
02:04:21,668 --> 02:04:26,330
Any move I make on Bane or the
bomb, the trigger-man will set it off.

1586
02:04:26,531 --> 02:04:29,387
They won’t use radio or
cell, too much interference.

1587
02:04:29,588 --> 02:04:31,198
Infrared don't have the range.

1588
02:04:31,399 --> 02:04:33,008
It had to be a Micro-burst.

1589
02:04:33,309 --> 02:04:33,982
Long-range.

1590
02:04:34,283 --> 02:04:35,807
- Can you block it?
- Yes.

1591
02:04:36,108 --> 02:04:39,680
But I need the EMP cannon
guidance mounted on the Bat.

1592
02:04:40,281 --> 02:04:42,813
Remember where you parked it?

1593
02:04:56,820 --> 02:04:58,014
It fly okay?

1594
02:04:59,715 --> 02:05:00,360
Yeah.

1595
02:05:00,995 --> 02:05:02,803
Even without the autopilot.
Thanks.

1596
02:05:03,004 --> 02:05:05,719
Autopilot?
That's what you're there for.

1597
02:05:45,130 --> 02:05:47,779
Thing's clear. Come on, quick! Climb.

1598
02:05:57,926 --> 02:05:59,443
Lock it up!

1599
02:06:03,868 --> 02:06:05,048
Who are you?

1600
02:06:34,454 --> 02:06:36,502
Light it up!

1601
02:06:53,618 --> 02:06:55,618
Mom check it out.

1602
02:06:55,882 --> 02:06:57,358
Honey, take a look.

1603
02:07:06,888 --> 02:07:09,150
Impossible.

1604
02:07:09,999 --> 02:07:11,339
Keep her close.

1605
02:07:12,440 --> 02:07:13,676
He'll come for her.

1606
02:07:14,177 --> 02:07:15,864
Where's Miranda Tate?

1607
02:07:16,465 --> 02:07:17,754
Bane took her.

1608
02:07:18,255 --> 02:07:21,333
He holds up city hall,
surrounded by his army.

1609
02:07:21,734 --> 02:07:26,472
This blocks detonator signal to the bomb.
Get it on to it before sunrise.

1610
02:07:26,673 --> 02:07:28,452
If I hit the button when starts.

1611
02:07:29,053 --> 02:07:30,741
When what start?

1612
02:07:31,042 --> 02:07:32,225
War.

1613
02:08:08,036 --> 02:08:09,196
You missed a spot.

1614
02:08:13,030 --> 02:08:14,150
If you're working alone...

1615
02:08:14,451 --> 02:08:15,805
...wear a mask.

1616
02:08:16,106 --> 02:08:18,022
I'm not afraid if they see me
standing up to these guys.

1617
02:08:18,123 --> 02:08:21,529
The mask is not for you, it's to
protect the people you care about.

1618
02:08:23,054 --> 02:08:24,914
Count to five and throw.

1619
02:08:35,264 --> 02:08:38,166
Hey no offense, 
but you got something bigger in that belt?

1620
02:08:48,466 --> 02:08:49,088
What now?

1621
02:08:49,289 --> 02:08:51,082
All out assault on Bane.

1622
02:08:51,483 --> 02:08:53,500
But you need to get
people across the bridge.

1623
02:08:54,301 --> 02:08:54,804
Why?

1624
02:08:55,005 --> 02:08:58,943
In case we fail. Leave an exodus.
Save as many lives as you can.

1625
02:08:59,044 --> 02:09:00,471
You don't need me here?

1626
02:09:00,972 --> 02:09:03,592
You given me an army... Now, go.

1627
02:09:04,393 --> 02:09:05,442
Thanks.

1628
02:09:05,643 --> 02:09:06,538
Don't thank me yet.

1629
02:09:06,739 --> 02:09:09,328
Well I might not get the chance later.

1630
02:09:23,244 --> 02:09:24,707
You shouldn't have.

1631
02:09:25,313 --> 02:09:27,442
All in town tunnel blocked by debris.

1632
02:09:28,043 --> 02:09:30,669
But the cannon have anough fire
power to make a path for people.

1633
02:09:31,070 --> 02:09:32,558
Wait until the fighting begins!

1634
02:09:32,859 --> 02:09:35,949
You going to wage your war
to save your stuck up girlfriend?

1635
02:09:36,150 --> 02:09:38,203
To start it, throttle.

1636
02:09:38,504 --> 02:09:39,436
I got it.

1637
02:09:39,737 --> 02:09:41,955
We have 45 minutes to save the city.

1638
02:09:42,156 --> 02:09:45,550
No... I got 45 minutes to get clear 
of the blast radius.

1639
02:09:45,785 --> 02:09:46,856
Because you don't stand a chance 
against these guys.

1640
02:09:47,557 --> 02:09:48,818
With your help, I might.

1641
02:09:49,019 --> 02:09:51,326
I open that tunnel, but then I'm gone.

1642
02:09:51,927 --> 02:09:54,172
There's more to you than that.

1643
02:09:57,617 --> 02:09:59,709
Sorry to keep letting you down.

1644
02:10:03,325 --> 02:10:08,588
Come with me!... Save yourself!

1645
02:10:09,971 --> 02:10:14,913
You don't owe these people anymore.
You given them everything.

1646
02:10:15,214 --> 02:10:16,187
Not everything.

1647
02:10:17,388 --> 02:10:18,155
Not yet.

1648
02:10:58,595 --> 02:11:02,651
<i>Disperse! 
Disperse or be fired upon!</i>

1649
02:11:03,883 --> 02:11:06,421
There's only one police in this town.

1650
02:11:45,151 --> 02:11:47,185
Open fire.

1651
02:12:38,183 --> 02:12:40,258
- Here it comes.
- Get ready!

1652
02:13:09,627 --> 02:13:13,710
So you came back to die with your city.

1653
02:13:14,211 --> 02:13:15,016
No.

1654
02:13:15,917 --> 02:13:17,735
I came back to stop you.

1655
02:13:29,255 --> 02:13:30,161
Now!

1656
02:13:43,307 --> 02:13:44,386
That's impossible.

1657
02:13:46,224 --> 02:13:47,684
Come over the fifth!

1658
02:14:02,832 --> 02:14:06,485
Get on the bus, guys.
You come with me. You too.

1659
02:14:06,786 --> 02:14:09,571
Hey you, you and you, Come here.

1660
02:14:10,172 --> 02:14:11,916
Everyone else get on the bus! 
Okay ?!

1661
02:14:12,117 --> 02:14:15,036
You guys, you're going to knock on doors and 
spread the word. Okay?

1662
02:14:15,137 --> 02:14:18,272
The bomb going to go off.
Get out by South Street tunnel...

1663
02:14:18,307 --> 02:14:19,099
...or over the bridge.

1664
02:14:19,400 --> 02:14:23,649
You go, you do two blocks, you get
back to the bus. Alright? Go!... Go!...

1665
02:14:24,445 --> 02:14:25,169
Is he back?

1666
02:14:27,170 --> 02:14:28,721
Keep your eyes open. 
Go... Go...

1667
02:15:50,663 --> 02:15:52,053
Cover the doors.

1668
02:15:55,587 --> 02:15:58,717
Where is the trigger?! 
Where is it?!

1669
02:15:59,827 --> 02:16:01,807
You never gave it to any 
ordinary citizen.

1670
02:16:02,508 --> 02:16:05,119
Where is it?!... Where's the trigger?!

1671
02:16:06,120 --> 02:16:08,891
Where is it?!... Where is it?!

1672
02:16:17,147 --> 02:16:18,943
Tell me where the trigger is it.

1673
02:16:19,644 --> 02:16:20,546
Then...

1674
02:16:21,147 --> 02:16:23,001
...you have mypermission to die.

1675
02:16:35,463 --> 02:16:36,595
I broke you.

1676
02:16:37,996 --> 02:16:40,459
How did you come back?

1677
02:16:40,560 --> 02:16:44,615
You think you're the only one who
could learn the strength to escape?

1678
02:16:44,916 --> 02:16:46,549
Where's the trigger?

1679
02:16:47,150 --> 02:16:49,085
But I never escaped.

1680
02:16:50,356 --> 02:16:52,755
But the child...

1681
02:16:53,656 --> 02:16:55,880
...Child of Ra's Al Ghul's who made the climb.

1682
02:16:56,281 --> 02:16:58,243
But he's not the child of Ra's Al Ghul.

1683
02:17:02,210 --> 02:17:03,223
I am.

1684
02:17:04,124 --> 02:17:06,036
Although I'm not ordinary.

1685
02:17:07,837 --> 02:17:09,030
I'm a citizen.

1686
02:17:29,117 --> 02:17:30,346
Miranda?

1687
02:17:33,056 --> 02:17:34,012
Why?

1688
02:17:34,713 --> 02:17:35,657
Thalia.

1689
02:17:36,858 --> 02:17:39,989
My mother named me Thalia before she was killed.

1690
02:17:40,390 --> 02:17:43,764
The way I have been killed if not for my protector.

1691
02:17:45,265 --> 02:17:46,637
Bane.

1692
02:17:54,018 --> 02:17:55,131
Good bye.

1693
02:17:57,250 --> 02:17:58,948
I climbed out of the pit.

1694
02:18:05,264 --> 02:18:07,018
I found my father.

1695
02:18:09,944 --> 02:18:13,145
And brought him back
to exact terrible vengeance.

1696
02:18:13,846 --> 02:18:15,490
But by that time...

1697
02:18:17,090 --> 02:18:20,591
...the prisoners and the doctor had their 
work to my friend.

1698
02:18:20,992 --> 02:18:22,284
My protector.

1699
02:18:26,056 --> 02:18:27,322
The League took us in.

1700
02:18:28,123 --> 02:18:29,122
Trained us.

1701
02:18:29,523 --> 02:18:32,587
But my father could not accept Bane.

1702
02:18:32,988 --> 02:18:36,343
He saw only a monster,
whose very existence.

1703
02:18:37,044 --> 02:18:40,919
Was the reminder of the hell
he left his wife to die in.

1704
02:18:41,220 --> 02:18:44,303
He excommunicated Bane from
The League of Shadows.

1705
02:18:44,604 --> 02:18:46,287
His only crime...

1706
02:18:47,188 --> 02:18:49,214
...was that he loved me.

1707
02:18:51,123 --> 02:18:54,223
I could not forgive my father.

1708
02:18:58,471 --> 02:19:00,235
Until you murdered him.

1709
02:19:18,058 --> 02:19:23,219
He was trying to kill millions
of innocent people.

1710
02:19:23,554 --> 02:19:28,684
"Innocent" is a strong word
to throw around Gotham roose.

1711
02:19:30,073 --> 02:19:32,726
I honor my father by finishing his work.

1712
02:19:45,173 --> 02:19:50,584
Vengeance against the man who killed him is 
a simply a reward for my patience.

1713
02:19:51,602 --> 02:19:52,485
You see?

1714
02:19:54,133 --> 02:19:58,405
It's the slow knife.
The knife that takes it's time.

1715
02:20:02,237 --> 02:20:07,569
The knife that wait years, without forgetting.

1716
02:20:07,870 --> 02:20:11,664
Then slip quietly between the bones...

1717
02:20:12,365 --> 02:20:16,478
...that's the knife that cut deepest.

1718
02:20:16,944 --> 02:20:18,197
Please!

1719
02:20:25,563 --> 02:20:28,793
Maybe that knife was too slow.

1720
02:20:29,550 --> 02:20:31,296
The truck is under attacked.

1721
02:20:31,597 --> 02:20:35,030
Gordon. You gave him a
way to block my signal

1722
02:20:35,331 --> 02:20:36,721
No matter.

1723
02:20:39,127 --> 02:20:42,171
He's bought Gotham eleven minutes.

1724
02:20:45,894 --> 02:20:47,894
Come on!... Come on!

1725
02:20:54,899 --> 02:20:56,719
Stay back! What are you doing?

1726
02:20:56,920 --> 02:21:00,190
Blake. MCU, I'm getting these boys to safety.

1727
02:21:00,491 --> 02:21:02,250
You're going to get us all killed.

1728
02:21:02,451 --> 02:21:05,185
Anyone cross this bridge,
they'll blow up the city.

1729
02:21:05,586 --> 02:21:08,579
It going to blow up anyway.
We need to open this bridge, now!

1730
02:21:08,780 --> 02:21:12,352
Detective, if you take one step forward, 
we will shoot you.

1731
02:21:12,553 --> 02:21:16,325
If you do two step forward,
we will blow the bridge.

1732
02:21:18,308 --> 02:21:21,843
Go back to the bus and wait for me alright? 
Just go back and wait.

1733
02:21:24,840 --> 02:21:26,064
They've prepared a convoy.

1734
02:21:26,365 --> 02:21:28,759
We must secure the bomb
until it detonates.

1735
02:21:29,929 --> 02:21:34,103
Don't kill him. I want him
to feel the heat.

1736
02:21:34,538 --> 02:21:37,668
Heat the fire of 12 million souls.

1737
02:21:37,903 --> 02:21:39,211
You failed.

1738
02:21:45,216 --> 02:21:47,787
Good bye, my friend.

1739
02:21:56,963 --> 02:22:00,365
Keep moving forward!
Take back the stairs!

1740
02:22:08,667 --> 02:22:09,620
Shoot them.

1741
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:11,911
Shoot them all.

1742
02:22:21,858 --> 02:22:25,043
We both know that 
I have to kill you now.

1743
02:22:28,153 --> 02:22:30,528
You have just to imagine the fire.

1744
02:22:38,409 --> 02:22:40,282
About the whole no guns thing.

1745
02:22:40,783 --> 02:22:44,214
I'm not sure I feel strongly
about it as you do.

1746
02:22:57,669 --> 02:22:58,871
Pull up.

1747
02:23:02,127 --> 02:23:03,283
Stay level.

1748
02:23:16,067 --> 02:23:19,323
We have to force them to
the entrance of the reactor.

1749
02:23:20,958 --> 02:23:24,026
I need you on the ground.
I'll be leaving. Go!

1750
02:23:24,227 --> 02:23:27,581
The situation has changed!
Your orders are out of date!

1751
02:23:28,182 --> 02:23:31,485
I'm a cop like you 
and I'm walking out there.

1752
02:23:32,286 --> 02:23:34,166
Please do not shoot me!

1753
02:23:36,779 --> 02:23:37,881
Shoot at his knee.

1754
02:23:47,729 --> 02:23:49,723
Nothing like a little air superiority.

1755
02:23:50,224 --> 02:23:55,668
Detective, please stop!
Please, detective! Stop!

1756
02:23:55,669 --> 02:24:01,519
Stop walking!... Blow it!... Do it!...

1757
02:24:13,024 --> 02:24:16,527
They have to get that bomb here
and you got ten minutes.

1758
02:24:26,175 --> 02:24:28,700
They're pushing us to the entrance 
of the reactor.

1759
02:24:29,001 --> 02:24:30,638
They're going to try to reconnect the core.

1760
02:24:31,463 --> 02:24:33,463
Idiots!

1761
02:24:34,229 --> 02:24:40,001
You son of bitches!... You killed them.
You're just following orders!

1762
02:24:40,398 --> 02:24:42,577
Alright boys get in circle,
bow your heads.

1763
02:24:44,788 --> 02:24:46,149
Not much longer.

1764
02:25:35,144 --> 02:25:37,562
Let's get everyone back in the bus.
Okay?

1765
02:25:37,563 --> 02:25:38,695
Go!... Go!... Go!... Go!... 
Back in the bus!

1766
02:25:39,096 --> 02:25:41,234
There's no where to go.

1767
02:25:42,035 --> 02:25:43,863
On the bus!

1768
02:26:39,763 --> 02:26:42,874
You got to the truck EAST!

1769
02:26:46,896 --> 02:26:48,383
Stay straight!

1770
02:27:20,439 --> 02:27:23,754
Give me a hand!
We can get a cable on it!

1771
02:27:30,512 --> 02:27:34,103
Fox showed me how overwrite reactor.

1772
02:27:37,057 --> 02:27:38,286
Oh. Dear.

1773
02:27:41,982 --> 02:27:45,513
Including the emergency flood.

1774
02:28:01,930 --> 02:28:08,630
There's no way this bomb will be stopped.

1775
02:28:09,158 --> 02:28:10,747
What are you doing?

1776
02:28:10,947 --> 02:28:11,683
Protect them from the blast!

1777
02:28:11,884 --> 02:28:13,286
We're going to be alright!
Double time! Go!

1778
02:28:13,287 --> 02:28:14,582
It's an atom bomb!

1779
02:28:14,583 --> 02:28:16,147
You think they need to hear that, right now?

1780
02:28:16,148 --> 02:28:17,604
You want to watch them die without hope? 
Come on!

1781
02:28:18,447 --> 02:28:19,891
Prepare yourself.

1782
02:28:21,292 --> 02:28:26,491
My father's work is done.

1783
02:28:32,591 --> 02:28:35,399
- What are you doing?
- I can get it out over the bay.

1784
02:28:35,700 --> 02:28:39,717
- Set it to fly over water and eject.
- No autopilot.

1785
02:28:41,679 --> 02:28:44,711
You could've gone anywhere, did
anything but you came back here.

1786
02:28:45,112 --> 02:28:46,170
So did you.

1787
02:28:46,371 --> 02:28:48,171
I guess we're both suckers.

1788
02:28:56,331 --> 02:28:59,095
- I never cared who you were.
- And you were right.

1789
02:28:59,396 --> 02:29:01,834
Shouldn't the people know the hero 
who saved them?

1790
02:29:02,035 --> 02:29:03,150
Hero can be anyone.

1791
02:29:03,351 --> 02:29:05,794
Even a man knowing something as simple...

1792
02:29:06,095 --> 02:29:08,673
...and reassuring putting 
a coat around a young boy shoulders...

1793
02:29:08,974 --> 02:29:11,829
...to let him the world hadn't end then.

1794
02:29:29,823 --> 02:29:31,665
Bruce Wayne?

1795
02:29:45,329 --> 02:29:48,025
Vlad, they go!... You too!...
Come on, father.

1796
02:30:07,015 --> 02:30:09,235
Hey heads down!... This is it!

1797
02:30:11,060 --> 02:30:12,865
No!... That's Batman!

1798
02:31:00,034 --> 02:31:01,977
That's detonation.

1799
02:31:09,169 --> 02:31:12,100
It's out over the bay, it's clear of the city.

1800
02:31:30,841 --> 02:31:33,070
<i>"I see a beautiful city."</i>

1801
02:31:33,471 --> 02:31:38,463
<i>"And the the brilliant people
rising from this abyss. "</i>

1802
02:31:38,864 --> 02:31:43,371
<i>"And I see the lives, for which
I lay down my life."</i>

1803
02:31:43,572 --> 02:31:49,660
<i>"Peaceful, useful, prosperous
and happy."</i>

1804
02:31:51,302 --> 02:31:55,360
<i>"I see that I hold a sanctuary
in their hearts."</i>

1805
02:31:56,466 --> 02:31:59,791
<i>"And in the hearts of
their decedents."</i>

1806
02:32:00,697 --> 02:32:02,216
<i>"Generations ends."</i>

1807
02:32:05,288 --> 02:32:09,459
"That's the far, 
far better thing that I do..."

1808
02:32:10,449 --> 02:32:12,233
"...than I had ever done. "

1809
02:32:12,834 --> 02:32:17,594
"And It's a far, far better rest that I go to."

1810
02:32:20,608 --> 02:32:22,731
"Than I had ever known."

1811
02:32:40,993 --> 02:32:44,760
I'm so sorry. I failed you.

1812
02:32:46,297 --> 02:32:48,526
You trusted me.

1813
02:32:49,433 --> 02:32:51,393
And I failed you.

1814
02:32:54,317 --> 02:32:56,747
Can't I change your mind?

1815
02:32:58,961 --> 02:33:00,870
About quitting the force?

1816
02:33:01,571 --> 02:33:05,516
You know you said about
structures becoming shackles.

1817
02:33:05,817 --> 02:33:09,491
You were right.
And I can't take it that in justice.

1818
02:33:09,716 --> 02:33:10,916
I mean...

1819
02:33:11,326 --> 02:33:13,932
...No one ever going to know 
who saved the entire city.

1820
02:33:14,233 --> 02:33:15,757
They know.

1821
02:33:17,348 --> 02:33:19,461
It was The Batman.

1822
02:33:36,979 --> 02:33:40,043
Mr. Wayne's will is not amended to
reflect his more modest estate.

1823
02:33:40,444 --> 02:33:43,835
Nonetheless, they're considerable
assets to dispose of.

1824
02:33:44,936 --> 02:33:47,967
The content of the house are to
be sold to settle the state accounts...

1825
02:33:48,168 --> 02:33:53,187
...and the remainders left in it's
entirety to Alfred J. Pennyworth.

1826
02:33:54,313 --> 02:33:58,422
The house and grounds are left to the city 
of Gotham on condition...

1827
02:33:58,423 --> 02:34:01,969
...that they never be demolish, altered
or otherwise interfered with.

1828
02:34:02,470 --> 02:34:07,464
That they shall be used for one purpose, 
and one purpose only.

1829
02:34:08,396 --> 02:34:12,301
The housing and care of the city's
at risk and orphan children.

1830
02:34:13,202 --> 02:34:17,569
And I clerk and help anyone with 
a small correspondences and instruction.

1831
02:34:17,870 --> 02:34:18,837
Blake, John?

1832
02:34:19,138 --> 02:34:20,376
Nothing here.

1833
02:34:20,701 --> 02:34:21,612
Alright.

1834
02:34:21,813 --> 02:34:23,664
Try my legal name.

1835
02:34:26,315 --> 02:34:29,883
You should use your full name.
I like that name, Robin.

1836
02:34:30,184 --> 02:34:31,006
Thanks.

1837
02:34:31,407 --> 02:34:32,846
Why are we even worrying
about stabilization software?

1838
02:34:33,147 --> 02:34:35,608
This entire autopilot system
is completely obsolete.

1839
02:34:35,909 --> 02:34:39,061
Please, I just need to know
what I could've done to fix it.

1840
02:34:39,262 --> 02:34:43,433
But Mr. Fox it's already been fixed,
software patch, six months ago.

1841
02:34:44,034 --> 02:34:45,779
Check The ID on the patch.

1842
02:34:48,701 --> 02:34:50,087
Bruce Wayne.

1843
02:34:50,788 --> 02:34:53,409
- Any news on the missing item?
- Not yet.

1844
02:34:53,710 --> 02:34:54,875
Better leave no stone unturned.

1845
02:34:55,175 --> 02:34:58,307
We can't leave a string of pearl 
on the manifest flaws.
