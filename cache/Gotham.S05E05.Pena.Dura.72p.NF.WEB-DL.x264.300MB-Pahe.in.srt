00:00:07,465 --> 00:00:09,092
<i>Raise your hands, Mr. Gordon.</i>

2
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:11,720
<i>I'm sorry, Steve, they made me do it.</i>

3
00:00:13,304 --> 00:00:14,723
<i>All right, be quiet, you.</i>

4
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,349
<i>Miss Zant, we're sorry
to interrupt your breakfast,</i>

5
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:17,475
<i>but if you'll come with us.</i>

6
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:18,601
<i>Quickly!</i>

7
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:19,769
<i>You may lower your hands
now, Mr. Gordon.</i>

8
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:20,895
[man] <i>Thanks.</i>

9
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:22,230
[Gordon] Turn around.

10
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:29,195
Is there a problem, Officer?

11
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,823
We know you sold the RPG
that took out Haven.

12
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:35,118
-So?
-So, I want to know who bought it.

13
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:36,619
Or what?

14
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:38,872
You gonna arrest me?

15
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:41,541
Who said anything
about arresting you?

16
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,752
I want a name.

17
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:46,504
-What do you say, boys?
-[guns cocking]

18
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:52,385
Should we show this lawman
how we feel about uninvited guests?

19
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:01,936
Now,

20
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:05,899
who told you I sold that RPG?

21
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:19,996
[grunting]

22
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:27,754
[gun fires]

23
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,439
Eduardo?

24
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:48,316
Nice shot, right? [snickers]

25
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,946
[female Delta Force soldier]
Lower your weapon now.

26
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:54,781
Delta Force, stand down.

27
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,743
-What are you doing here?
-Come on.

28
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,746
The last time I saw you,
you were running through sniper fire

29
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,998
plucking my sorry ass
from a burning truck.

30
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,334
The least I could do is pay you back.

31
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:08,711
I had that guy right where
I wanted him.

32
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,382
I'm glad you're here.

33
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:15,802
Yeah, me, too.

34
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:23,893
We hated each other in boot.

35
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:27,272
-Jim disapproved of my ops tempo.
-[chuckles] Yeah.

36
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:29,524
Because you only had one speed.
Too fast.

37
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:32,235
Took me a while to realize he wasn't
afraid to get his hands dirty.

38
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:33,653
-Just being careful.
-Yeah.

39
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:35,196
Well, Jim's taught me a thing or two

40
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,614
-about being careful.
-[Gordon exhales]

41
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:38,616
So, what's the mission plan?

42
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,162
Well, we are the help
Secretary Walker promised.

43
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:45,081
Our goal is to make
this hell-hole safe again.

44
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,417
So it took the murder
of hundreds of innocent civilians

45
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,168
-to get the government to act.
-We're here to eliminate

46
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:50,420
all criminal threats.

47
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,839
We're gonna blanket the city
with flash sweeps.

48
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:54,632
And what about the people
that are still trapped here?

49
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,551
-They need relief now.
-Hey, I'm with you.

50
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:57,760
But my mandate's clear.

51
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:01,389
First we restore order,
then we take the next steps.

52
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:03,558
[Delta Force soldier] Sir.

53
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:05,810
We got something, sir.

54
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:08,730
Captain Gordon, this is my second.
Sergeant Angel Vallelunga.

55
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:09,981
Captain.

56
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,191
Ledger.

57
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:15,528
Our arms dealer
kept track of his buyers.

58
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:20,742
"Edward Nygma.

59
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,160
Two RPG."

60
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:23,786
Nygma.

61
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:27,290
Yeah, the name's on my list.
You think he's our bomber?

62
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,500
Only one way to find out. All right.

63
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:31,294
You and I will get Nygma.

64
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:33,796
Harvey, I need you to set up
a command center

65
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,256
with the soldiers at GCPD.

66
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,591
-I'll grab some guys.
-Yeah.

67
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,384
Hey, look. Hey, Jim.

68
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,386
I'm not as fast as I used to be,

69
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,930
but I still got some fight in me.

70
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:44,265
I'm not a desk jockey,
I'm a street guy.

71
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,476
What you are
is the best cop that I know.

72
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:50,063
We're going after Nygma,
he's ten steps ahead.

73
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:52,232
If things goes sideways,
you're gonna have to take over.

74
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:54,776
I need your help, buddy.

75
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,571
I got it.

76
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:08,039
Alfred.

77
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:10,541
There you are, Master Bruce.

78
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,586
There's been a break
in the Haven bombing.

79
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,756
Seems that Gordon and Bullock have
got a rather strong lead, apparently.

80
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,552
-What's the matter with you?
-I can't find Selina.

81
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,304
I looked all over the Green Zone.

82
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,474
Somehow I think Miss Kyle
is perfectly capable

83
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:28,476
of looking after herself,
Master Bruce.

84
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:30,019
Except that she's not herself.

85
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,397
You saw what she did to Jeremiah.

86
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:34,732
Yes, I did.

87
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:38,194
Listen, come here.

88
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:44,284
Jeremiah Valeska deserved to die.

89
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:48,579
Jeremiah made Selina a murderer,

90
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,291
just like Ra's made me a murderer.

91
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:54,210
Ra's goaded you into stabbing him,
Master Bruce.

92
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:57,171
He used you as an instrument.
You're no murderer.

93
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:58,881
But Selina is.

94
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:00,800
You're not the same.

95
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,303
She did what she did with open eyes

96
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:05,430
and you got to learn
to respect that, son.

97
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:07,598
You're wrong about her, Alfred.

98
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:10,810
And I'm gonna go find her.

99
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:14,397
[scoffs]

00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:48,806
You're not a murderer, Ed!

111
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,060
Except Kristin Kringle.

112
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:54,979
And Officer Dougherty.

113

But all those people...

114
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:00,651
and children.

115
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:03,029
How could you do it?

116
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:04,655
Why?

00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:06,491
[breathing heavily]

118
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:09,077
It doesn't matter why.

119

What matters

120
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:13,873
is that it was you

121
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:15,416
who killed them.

122
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,002

125
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:27,428
you're under arrest
for the attack at Haven,

126
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,388
and the murder
of hundreds of innocent people.

127
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:30,598
No.

128
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:33,101
No, Jim, I can explain.

129
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:34,727
Explain?

130
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,939
You son of a bitch.
You actually did it.

-On your knees, now!
-No, I didn't.

132
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:45,404
I can prove it. I just... I need...
I need a little bit of time.

133
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,906
-Say the word, Jim.
-[Gordon cocks gun]

134
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:48,574
You know me, Jim.

135
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:52,245
The people that I have hurt...

136
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:54,705
They hurt me first.

137
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,791
I didn't know a single person
in Haven.

138
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,584
I'm innocent.

139
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:02,672
It's your call, buddy.

140
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,550
He basically confessed.

141
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:12,598
We bring him in.

142
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:14,308
He stands trial.

143
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,269
Yeah, I don't think so.

Your friend is standing
on a pressure-plated IED.

148
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,576
and you'll repaint the room
with your organs.

Don't do it, Jim.

150
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,627
This little doohickey

151
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,629
monitors my heartbeat.

152
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,673
It increases by ten...

153
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:51,012
Boom. Decreases by ten... Boom.

154
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:52,388
[Gordon] You try to walk out of here

155
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,682
and a Special Forces sniper
will put a bullet in your head.

156
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:57,351
No, they won't.
This thing can detonate his bomb

157
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:58,644
from a mile away.

158
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:01,647
Or am I bluffing?

159
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,859
Once word gets out
that you're responsible for Haven,

160
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:06,777
you'll have a target on your back.

161
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,321
I'll take my chances.

162
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:14,076
-I think he's bluffing.
-No, no. He doesn't bluff.

163
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,080
I don't want anyone here
if this thing detonates.

Welcome to Gotham.

169
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,676
So what do we do?

170
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:34,430
Well, the way I see it,
now we're all tied up.

171
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,432
I just got to save
your life one more time

172
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:37,725
and I'm back in the lead.

173
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:40,686
Funny. Seriously,
what the hell we're gonna do?

174
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:45,024
Well, he pulled a book,
set the booby trap.

175
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:48,736
I think I can make it.

176
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:53,074
Assuming the vibrations
don't trigger the IED, what then?

177
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,118
Then we just got to figure out what
sort of puzzle he wants us to solve.

178
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,537
Puzzle?

179
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,288
There's always a puzzle with Nygma.

180
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,165
You ready?

181
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,251

I'm gonna ring this nerd's neck.

187

-You left the Army for this city?

[Harvey]<i>Jim, you nab Nygma?</i>

200
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:01,994
No. Put the word out.

201
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:05,456
Nygma's wanted for murder
and the attack on Haven.

202
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,041
[guns firing]

203

But still no Nygma.

243
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:25,596
My boys will scoop him up
by nightfall.

244
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:30,893
Now, tell me about this Scarecrow.

245
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,728
Well, he has chemical weapons.

246

Your guys would need gas masks.

247
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:37,691
Taking him down would be a big win.

Who's JoJo?

00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,513
JoJo was in Haven

Locking everyone up.
They're coming this way.

[Penguin] Please.

321
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,313
An invasion is tanks.

322
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:47,316
Infantry. These are scouts.

323
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,568
-What about Nygma?
-Nobody's seen him,

324
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:50,861
but we've got feelers out.

325
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:54,948
Well, you tell your feelers

326
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:59,203
that the first man to bring me Nygma
is the one who gets to live!

327
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,247
Now!

328
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:06,543
[Penguin sighs loudly]

329
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:13,383
I am surrounded by morons, Edward.

330
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:17,304
If I didn't have an empire to run,
I would go get Nygma myself.

331
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:18,430
[chuckles]

332

334
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:32,778
Hello, Oswald.

335
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,114
We have a great deal to talk about.

336
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:36,907
But first...

337
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:40,661
did you name your dog after me?

338
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:45,666
[Harvey] Jim.

339
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:48,752
Harper just radioed. She saw Nygma
going into City Hall.

340
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,337
He's going to Penguin.

341
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,714
Cobblepot's at the top
of my list from Walker.

342
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,216
Sounds like a two-fer.

343
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,510
Penguin's sitting on all the ammo
in Gotham.

344
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:58,971
He's better defended,
better manned than anyone else.

345
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,557
We need shock and awe.

346
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,308
Shock and awe is my default.

347
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:04,977
You ready?

348
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:09,439
You know what?
Take Harvey on this one.

349
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:11,275
I'll keep things locked down here.

350

Man, you're killing my buzz.

00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:25,622
[Bruce] Selina.

354
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,917
I know you, and this isn't you.

355
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,426
-You know me?
-Yes.

356
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,138
Maybe better than you know yourself.

357
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,311
Let me tell you something.

358
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,900
That night
that your parents were murdered,

359
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:59,323
I was in that alley
on the fire escape.

360
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,660
And I watched that guy

361
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,955
shoot your father

362
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:10,209
and shoot your mother.

363
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,837
And through it all,

364
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,297
I did...

365
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:17,966
nothing.

366
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:19,176
[chuckles]

367
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:24,848
I didn't call for help. I didn't...

368
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,100
[sobbing]

369
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:29,686
I didn't scream for the guy to stop.

370
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:34,566
It wasn't your fault.
You were just a scared kid.

371
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:37,861
No.

372
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:43,909
You were the scared kid.

373
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:52,042
We are not the same, Bruce.

374
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:58,173
I didn't do anything
because I wasn't willing

375
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:01,510
to risk my neck for someone else
because I didn't care.

376
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:07,224
That's who I was,
and that's who I am.

377
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,271
[rock music playing]

378
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:16,608
I love this song.

379
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,450
What did you do to me?

380
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:27,369
Oswald?

381
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,329
What are you talking about?

382
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:30,497
Oh, please.

383
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,917
You did something to me.

384
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,919
You...

385
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:40,549
You are the reason
I killed those people.

386
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:42,592
How could you?

387
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:47,014
You have made me into
some murderous puppet.

388
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:50,892
For weeks, I've been
waking up in strange places

389
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,979
not knowing how I got there
or what I did.

390
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:57,024
Driving myself mad,
thinking I had gone mad.

391
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,903
And now I know
that it was all your doing.

392
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:06,616
Of everything that you
have put me through...

393
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:13,749
this... this is the most cruel.

394
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,255
Ed...

395
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:23,050
I don't know
what you're talking about.

396
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:27,262
I did not make you do anything.

397
00:22:27,345 --> 00:22:31,058
Then what is, "I'll fix you."
What did that mean?

398
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:35,187
You didn't fix me. You broke me.

399
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,105
Wait! No...

400
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:41,318
I said that to you
the night the bridges blew.

401
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,321
You think I wouldn't remember.

402
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:48,366
No, Ed, I saved your life. That's it.
[laughs nervously]

403
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,161
-What are you talking about?
-[sighs]

404
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:54,790
You had been stabbed, I paid
Hugo Strange to save your life.

405
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:58,460
[snaps fingers] I bet he did something
to you when he was patching you up.

406
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,839
You paid Hugo Strange to save me?

407
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:04,841
Why?

408
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:09,179
What was I supposed to do,
let you die?

409
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,556
After Butch, you were my only friend.

410
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,308
You shot Butch.

411
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:15,435
Which is why I needed you!

412
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:18,146
[frustrated grunt]

413
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,320
[exhales]

414
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:34,371
Edward Nygma,

415
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:36,331
if I wanted you to suffer,

416
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:41,628
I would never do it in
some backhanded way.

417
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,966
If you and I

418
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:49,553
are ever at odds again,

419
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:53,056
you will know without a doubt

420
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:56,601
that I am your enemy.

421
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:01,314
I promise you that.

422
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:06,027
As a friend.

423
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:14,744
[grunts]

424
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:16,997
[breathing heavily]

425
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,085
What a mess.

426
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:24,671
I might have killed you, Oswald.

427
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:31,553
And if that day comes...

428
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:37,893
I swear to you,
I will stare you in the eye

429
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:40,520
as I stab you in the heart.

430
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:43,398
[snickers]

431
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:50,447
Look on the bright side.

432
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,908
If Hugo Strange did do
something to you,

433
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,328
it means you are
not responsible for Haven.

434
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:00,916
-Where is he?
-[rumbling]

435
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:05,670
Sir, the GCPD and the Army
have blown the gates.

436
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:09,174
Stay here, you'll be safe.

437
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,636
Grab Nygma. They want him, not me.

438
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:16,514
He's gone.

439
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:20,977
Damn it!

440
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:22,437
[grunts]

441
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:27,025
[beeping]

442
00:25:34,532 --> 00:25:35,575
[guns cocking]

443
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:37,494
[laughs]

444
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:41,373
Why, hello, Harvey. [chuckles]

445
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:47,128
Now, last time we were in a standoff,
you ran out of bullets.

446
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:49,798
[chortles]

447
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,050
I hope you're better prepared.

448
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:57,973
We don't want to take
your territory, Oswald.

449
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:01,935
But you have to put down your weapons
and hand over Ed Nygma.

450
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,396
Or...

451
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:09,234
If you and your friends aren't
out by the time I count to three,

452
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:12,237
I will mow you all down!

453
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,825
We good?

454
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,285
Yup.

455
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:21,913
Go ahead, count.

456
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:25,583
[chuckles]

457
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:29,379
Harvey, you're not thinking clearly.

458
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:33,800
Maybe call your boss.
See what he thinks.

459
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:35,927
[Harvey] I don't have to call anyone.

460
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,097
Go ahead, count.

461
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:52,902
-One...
-[silenced gunshots]

462
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:54,446
[Penguin gasps]

463
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:03,621
How's that for better prepared?

464
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,499
Where's Ed Nygma?

465
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:10,712
The whole of Gotham
is looking for you.

466
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:12,630
I need information. Your specialty.

467
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:21,222
I am going to cut your face
into a jigsaw puzzle

468
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,142
and watch you try
and put it back together again.

469
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:25,352
[stammers] Barbara!

470
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:27,312
Am I dumb?

471
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:32,400
In all the years of plotting
and the betrayals between us,

472
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:36,821
have you ever, ever known me
to do something as idiotically brutal

473
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:39,324
as shoot a rocket into
a building full of innocent people?

474
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:43,411
I did not kill those people in Haven.

475
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:46,790
Not exactly.

476
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,876
There's more going on here.

477
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,176
I'm waiting.

478
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,889
The night the bridges fell,
I was hurt.

479
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:05,141
Oswald took me to Hugo Strange.

480
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:08,978
And he did something to my brain.

481
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:11,815
And that's your excuse for
murdering hundreds of people?

482
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:13,441
I'm saying,

483
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:17,112
that Strange or somebody
can control me.

484
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:19,697
They killed those people.

485
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:24,411
Okay, let's say by some miracle
I believe you.

486
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:26,413
Why the hell should I help you?

487
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,581
Because who's working with Strange?

488
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:32,710
Who would force me
to kill all of those people?

489
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:36,756
Information is your lifeblood.

490
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,466
You help me,

491
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:41,428
and I will give you
the best intel you've ever had.

492
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:49,269
I don't know where Strange is.

493
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:52,272
But I can tell you
where you'll find his Igors.

494
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:53,898
[grunts]

495
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:56,025
[Eduardo] Where is Edward Nygma?

496
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:00,196
You're protecting a mass murderer.

497
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,031
Don't look to me for sympathy.

498
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:06,870
Fine.

499
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:10,081
But not with that meathead around.

500
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:11,791
[Penguin breathing heavily]

501
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:16,546
[Penguin laughing]

502
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:21,134
You know, they say you can
judge a man by his friends.

503
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:23,094
This from a man who has no friends?

504
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:24,763
[people clamoring in distance]

505
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,225
Talk.

506
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,103
Nygma's a patsy.

507
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:34,773
He is not a mass murderer.

508
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,526
Puzzles, games...

509
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,404
Perhaps the odd killing
here and there.

510
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:44,491
But hundreds of people? No.

511
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:46,951
That's not him, you know this.

512
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:50,997
So, who set him up?

513
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:52,916
[chuckles]

514
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:58,421
Jim, you want information,
I want to go home.

515
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,548
Eduardo is not gonna go for that.

516
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,717
Oh, I'm sorry,
I thought you were in charge.

517
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:09,224
Even if I were to let you go,

518
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:12,060
sooner or later
the Army's gonna come for you.

519
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,896
Things are changing in Gotham.

520
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:19,359
I'll take my chances.

521
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:24,739
Now, do you want Nygma or not?

522
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:34,082
I know where Nygma's going.

523
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:43,883
And I trust you know
what you're doing.

524
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,427
We do what we have to do, right?

525
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:03,778
Gentlemen. Come in, you're late.

526
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:09,617
The last body you procured for me
was gangrenous.

527
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:12,662
Completely unsuitable.

528
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:16,958
Oh, my.

529
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,043
Bye.

530
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:21,546
Hello, Professor.

531
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:25,842
[laughing] Mr. Nygma.

532
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:28,761
Let's skip the part where you deny
making me into a killing machine.

533
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:31,180
Tell me...

534
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:33,808
how you took control of my alter ego.

535
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:35,685
I don't follow.

536
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:40,189
You did something to access
the Ed Nygma side of my personality.

537
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:42,984
But you're Ed Nygma.

538
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:44,611
I'm also the Riddler!

539
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:47,405
Tell me what you did.

540
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:52,118
Why did you make me kill
all those people in Haven?

541
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:53,912
You did that?

542
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:55,872
How interesting.

543
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:57,874
I had no idea.

544
00:31:57,957 --> 00:31:59,584
Do you really expect me
to believe that?

545
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:04,505
Mr. Nygma, I don't know
anything about your alter egos.

546
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:09,469
But I will confess that when I was
sewing up your knife wound,

547
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:13,097
I may have tinkered a little
with your brain matter.

548
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:15,808
-Would you just--
-I put a chip in your brain.

549
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:21,022
It allows you to be able
to be controlled remotely.

550
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:24,692
I knew it.

551
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,402
But I don't control you.

552
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:28,780
I gave control to others.

553
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:29,906
Who?

554
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:34,327
I will write it down.

555
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,621
That way, if I'm ever confronted,

556
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:40,249
I can honestly say
that I never told you.

557
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:52,637
[exhales]

558
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:59,394
Not to worry, you're experiencing
a simple neural cutout.

559
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:04,565
I am mystified as to how you've
become aware you're being controlled.

560
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:09,862
I suppose we're just going
to have to open you up

561
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:13,282
and take a look under the hood.

562
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:17,954
Won't we?

563
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:22,375
-Jim?
-I'm sorry, kid, it's just me.

564
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,673
Are you all right?

565
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:32,135
Yeah, I'm just, uh... Just looking
for Jim. It's nothing.

566
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:35,054
I saw soldiers downstairs.

567
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:38,474
Yeah, the Army's finally
gotten off their asses

568
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:40,560
and decided to help.
Jim's out with them now.

569
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,189
Are you sure you're all right?

570
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:52,905
I don't know.

571
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:57,493
I see people losing
their will to do good.

572
00:33:58,661 --> 00:34:00,121
People I love.

573
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:02,832
What if we don't make it out of this?

574
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:04,167
I'm not gonna lie, kid.

575
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:07,754
These past few months,
I've wondered the same thing.

576
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:11,466
And when I don't know
what to do, I come up here

577
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:14,052
and I dig into these case files.

578
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,429
Sit my ass down and I get to work.

579
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,057
I used to hate
this kind of paperwork.

580
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,100
Now, it's the only thing
that keeps me going.

581
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:24,437
-Why?
-Because the little things matter.

582
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:27,023
Act by act. Deed by deed.

583
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:29,025
It means something.

584
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:32,779
Even if no one notices or cares.

585
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,536
-Thanks, Harvey.
-You're welcome, kid.

586
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:44,957
If you really wanna do
an old man a favor,

587
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:48,044
you could scrounge me up
a cup of joe, because I, uh...

588
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:53,883
Kid's fast.

589
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:56,469
[device whirring]

590
00:34:56,552 --> 00:34:58,930
I apologize for the discomfort.

591
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:02,600
The neural cutout
inhibits muscular function,

592
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:05,311
but not pain receptors.

593
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:10,149
A simple reboot of the chip
should be all that is required.

594
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:14,153
Although, the sound may be,
uh, somewhat unpleasant.

595
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:18,366
Not to mention the smell.

596
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,204
[Edward whining]

597
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:54,193
[panting]

598
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:58,739
[Edward growling]

599
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:20,720
Edward, I believe the time has come
for a change of scenery.

600
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:27,435
-[staple gun clicking]
-It seems a powerful electrical charge

601
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:30,980
overloaded your chip,
but I've gotten everything updated.

602
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:35,109
I will pass the good news
along to your handler.

603
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,444
[gun cocks]

604
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:38,154
[Gordon] Care to expand on that?

605
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:42,992
I was merely helping a man
who needed medical attention.

606
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:45,161
Yeah, I'm not buying it.

607
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:49,457
His eyes are open.

608
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,293
I gave him a bio-medical anesthesia.

609
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:53,878
Wake him up. Now.

610
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:56,756
-Do it.
-Oh, very well.

611
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:00,676
[screams]

612
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:04,180
I told you this wasn't me.

613
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:07,058
He put a chip in my brain.

614
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:09,310
And someone's been controlling it
this whole time.

615
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:10,937
And then he drilled in my head.

616
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:14,065
-[Gordon] Better talk now.
-I am a scientist.

617
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:18,444
A contract came along.
I developed a tool.

618
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:20,738
A tool? How dare you?

619
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:22,448
A contract from who?

620
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:23,699
[beeps]

621
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:29,830
Please escort the professor out.
Thank you.

622
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:33,084
Ta-ta.

623
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:36,671
What the hell is going on?

624
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:40,424
Sorry, pal, but this part of the op,
it's need-to-know.

625
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,094
Couldn't say anything until
we had the suspect in custody,

626
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:46,222
but Walker wants Ed Nygma
taken out now.

627
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:49,767
Walker was behind this?

628
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:51,686
She's been controlling Nygma
the whole time?

629
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:54,021
[Eduardo chuckles]

630
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,482
You know I hate this spook crap.

631
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:58,734
I don't ask questions,
I follow orders.

632
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:00,903
She's responsible for Haven?

633
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:05,074
-I don't understand, why--
-Jim, stop right there.

634
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,993
Trust me.

635
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:11,580
Walker wants you
to put a bullet in his brain.

636
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:16,711
No.

637
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:18,754
Call it proof of loyalty.

638
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,340
It's what she needs from you

639
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:24,802
before she can move forward
with the final relief plan.

640
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:27,888
Come on.

641
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:29,515
Look at him.

642
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:31,809
He's a loon, a cop killer.

643
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:35,187
Tell me the truth.

644
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:37,690
Did Walker destroy Haven?

645
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:39,400
Did you know? Tell me!

646
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:41,485
Jim, ours is not to reason why

647
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:44,280
and this is your chance
to be a part of this mission.

648
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:49,118
So, please.

649
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:53,789
You pull the trigger on him
or I pull the trigger on you.

650
00:38:56,334 --> 00:39:00,087
After all this, you'd kill me
for some bureaucrat?

651
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:04,467
Mission comes first.
You taught me that.

652
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:08,471
What's your answer?

653
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:27,031
Looks like I saved your life
one too many times.

654
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:32,453
Maybe so.

655
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:33,913
[grunting]

656
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:49,762
[beeps]

657
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:53,682
You know Jim Gordon,
you know this city.

658
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:55,518
Find him and kill him.

659
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:09,323
[hammer thudding]

660
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:22,711
[gasps]

661
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:27,550
Boss, wake up.

662
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:31,637
-Wake up.
-Ouch.

663
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:35,057
Ooh! Stitches still sore, huh?

664
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:38,561
Never would have happened
if you wore that armor I'd prepared.

665
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:43,065
That bullet is
making you sentimental.

666
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:46,569
Give her a shake, huh?

667
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:49,655
Huh.

668
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,615
Better?

669
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:57,455
I told you I had to let Selina
thrust the knife into my flesh

670
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:59,248
at least once.

671
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:02,543
Verisimilitude trumps precaution,
you see.

672
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:05,629
I get it. Selina Kyle and Bruce Wayne

673
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:08,340
-needed to think you were dead, boss.
-Yeah.

674
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:12,303
-Wait!
-[gasps]

675
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:14,096
I take it you have news.

676
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:16,265
All systems go.

677
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:18,184
-Well, then lead the way.
-[gasps]

678
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:34,617
Doctor?

679
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,577
I'm hearing good things.

680
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,871
The bandages are ready to come off.

681
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:41,457
Your assistant thought
you'd like to see the results.

682
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:44,627
Indeed I would.

683
00:41:58,557 --> 00:41:59,892
[laughs]

684
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:06,732
Oh, you two look beautiful.

685
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:10,236
Ah...

686
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:16,575
I love family reunions, don't you?
