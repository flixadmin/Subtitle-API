1
00:00:00,275 --> 00:00:02,698
<i>Previously on "Legends of Tomorrow"...</i>

2
00:00:02,701 --> 00:00:03,983
What kind of egg is that?

3
00:00:03,986 --> 00:00:06,630
- It's a dragon egg.
- Oh.

4
00:00:07,466 --> 00:00:09,248
Okay, you got possessed by Neron.

5
00:00:10,577 --> 00:00:12,035
I can't stop!

6
00:00:12,037 --> 00:00:13,669
I give up. Do you hear me, Neron?

7
00:00:13,672 --> 00:00:15,714
Spare Nate and I'll let you have me.

8
00:00:17,727 --> 00:00:21,053
- Neron?
- I can make you whole again.

9
00:00:21,055 --> 00:00:23,213
- My nipple.
- Gary, no!

10
00:00:27,603 --> 00:00:28,977
Nora, I need your help.

11
00:00:28,979 --> 00:00:30,720
I am asking you to face another demon

12
00:00:30,722 --> 00:00:32,031
<i>as a member of the Time Bureau.</i>

13
00:00:32,033 --> 00:00:33,264
Let's do this.

14
00:00:40,732 --> 00:00:43,315
All right, enough of the
sightseeing. Can we go now?

15
00:00:43,318 --> 00:00:45,419
I'm a bit knackered, to
be honest with you, mate.

16
00:00:45,421 --> 00:00:46,953
We're not here as tourists, Johnny.

17
00:00:46,956 --> 00:00:48,154
Ah, right, you're gonna get rid of me

18
00:00:48,156 --> 00:00:49,781
in some dramatic fashion.

19
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:51,407
Get on with it, will you?

20
00:00:51,409 --> 00:00:53,835
I'm not gonna kill you. Not yet, anyway.

21
00:00:53,837 --> 00:00:55,929
- I need you for a favor.
- Is that right?

22
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:58,289
Mm, I need you to open
up a doorway to hell.

23
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:01,522
Oh, right. Well, why didn't you say so?

24
00:01:01,525 --> 00:01:04,438
I will gladly open
up a vortex right here

25
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,584
and give you the old
heave-ho to the great beyond.

26
00:01:07,587 --> 00:01:09,592
The door is not for me, Johnny.

27
00:01:09,594 --> 00:01:12,595
It's to bring someone
here from the other side.

28
00:01:12,597 --> 00:01:15,348
Tabitha. Ah, that's right.

29
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:16,858
If she comes straight
through the doorway,

30
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,144
she doesn't need a human vessel.

31
00:01:19,146 --> 00:01:21,377
And what in that demented
demon brain of yours

32
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,940
makes you think that I'm going
to open a vortex for you, eh?

33
00:01:23,942 --> 00:01:26,651
Unlike Gary, I've still
got both my nipples,

34
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:28,414
so you don't have much to bargain with.

35
00:01:28,417 --> 00:01:29,967
Speaking of which,

36
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:31,489
what have you done with the Muppet?

37
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:32,949
Gary's just fine.

38
00:01:32,951 --> 00:01:35,969
He's back at the Time Bureau
taking care of business.

39
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:42,976
<i>Okay, Nora, you can do this.</i>

40
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:46,262
Just... be normal.

41
00:01:46,265 --> 00:01:47,815
You can be normal.

42
00:01:47,817 --> 00:01:49,391
'Cause you are normal.

43
00:01:49,393 --> 00:01:51,634
- Next.
- Come on!

44
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,656
That's your ID picture?

45
00:01:55,658 --> 00:01:57,157
They wouldn't let me retake it.

46
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:59,684
Oh, it can't be that bad. Let me see.

47
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:06,741
Uh, maybe we'll just use your
photo from the wanted poster.

48
00:02:06,743 --> 00:02:09,027
So your ID is in process.

49
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:11,413
And you have me to help
you with your orientation.

50
00:02:11,415 --> 00:02:12,581
All that's left is this.

51
00:02:13,617 --> 00:02:14,991
What the hell's that?

52
00:02:14,993 --> 00:02:16,283
It's your start paperwork.

53
00:02:16,286 --> 00:02:19,263
No, I should be out looking for Ray.

54
00:02:19,265 --> 00:02:20,830
I really have to fill all this out?

55
00:02:20,832 --> 00:02:21,974
I know. I know, Nora.

56
00:02:21,976 --> 00:02:23,183
But until we have a line on Neron,

57
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:24,500
there's really nothing we can do.

58
00:02:24,502 --> 00:02:25,668
And let's be honest, Nora.

59
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:27,921
You have a storied history here.

60
00:02:27,923 --> 00:02:31,007
I need you to prove that
you can be a team player.

61
00:02:31,009 --> 00:02:32,225
Have fun.

62
00:02:34,055 --> 00:02:35,485
Oh, and you know what, Nora?

63
00:02:37,307 --> 00:02:38,648
I'm really, really proud of you.

64
00:02:40,152 --> 00:02:41,476
Welcome to the Bureau.

65
00:02:49,953 --> 00:02:52,904
Director Sharpe. I've
been waiting for you.

66
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:54,239
Gary, I told you, no
playing with my chair

67
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:55,457
until after hours.

68
00:02:55,459 --> 00:02:57,575
Oh, playtime's over.

69
00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:59,336
Shut the door.

70
00:02:59,338 --> 00:03:01,037
We need to talk.

71

<i>If Neron wanted John dead,</i>

73
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,257
<i>he would have killed him on the spot.</i>

74
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:13,975
He must need something from him.

75
00:03:13,977 --> 00:03:16,478
We have to find them before
he can get what he wants.

76
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,063
Who knows what he's
doing in Ray's name...

77
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:20,574
or his perfectly grass-fed
organic butter body?

78
00:03:20,576 --> 00:03:21,975
If Haircut's even there.

79
00:03:21,977 --> 00:03:23,468
We don't know that Ray is gone.

80
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,561
Look, everybody just breathe.
Gideon's already on it.

81
00:03:25,563 --> 00:03:26,644
<i>I've attuned the magic-o-meter</i>

82
00:03:26,646 --> 00:03:28,323
<i>to Constantine's frequency.</i>

83
00:03:28,325 --> 00:03:31,033
<i>When he uses his abilities, I
can zero in on his location.</i>

84
00:03:31,036 --> 00:03:32,443
And what do we do till then?

85
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:33,837
- Stress eat.
- Drink.

86
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:35,422
Yeah, how'd you lot survive until now?

87
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:37,499
Look, until we get an alert, we wait.

88
00:03:37,501 --> 00:03:38,592
Right, we wait.

89
00:03:39,995 --> 00:03:41,786
I gotta go clear my head.

90
00:03:44,299 --> 00:03:45,915
<i>What do you think this is about?</i>

91
00:03:45,917 --> 00:03:47,959
With everything that's been going on,

92
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:51,421
I bet Director Sharpe is about
to lay down the plan of attack.

93
00:03:52,867 --> 00:03:55,183
I've gathered you here because
today we're setting time aside

94
00:03:55,185 --> 00:03:57,093
to conduct performance reviews.

95
00:03:57,095 --> 00:03:58,928
But this time, I thought
it would be useful

96
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,831
if you were assessed
by one of your peers,

97
00:04:00,834 --> 00:04:02,473
Agent Gary Green.

98
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:04,526
Gary?

99
00:04:04,528 --> 00:04:05,810
- Seriously?
- Huh?

100
00:04:05,813 --> 00:04:07,137
Thanks, doll.

101
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,791
How are my babies doing?

102
00:04:10,793 --> 00:04:12,442
Let's rap for a sec.

103
00:04:12,444 --> 00:04:14,068
Is Gary cool now?

104
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,611
That's impossible.

105
00:04:15,613 --> 00:04:18,656
Now, I know performance
reviews can be quite a drag,

106
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:20,375
but this year's gonna be
different 'cause you've got

107
00:04:20,377 --> 00:04:22,814
superagent Gary Green in your corner.

108
00:04:22,817 --> 00:04:24,287
So no need to stress...

109
00:04:24,289 --> 00:04:26,956
unless your infraction is
looking too good in that suit.

110
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:29,782
Agent Reyes knows
what I'm talking about.

111
00:04:30,857 --> 00:04:32,813
Oh, my God. I think she just swooned.

112
00:04:32,815 --> 00:04:34,213
This is a nightmare.

113
00:04:34,215 --> 00:04:35,882
So I'll be meeting
with agents one-on-one,

114
00:04:35,884 --> 00:04:37,859
and, uh, wait till I call your name.

115
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:41,154
Looking forward to some good face time.

116
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:47,185
Ava, are you sure this is the best time

117
00:04:47,187 --> 00:04:48,662
for performance reviews?

118
00:04:48,664 --> 00:04:50,367
There's no better time
to assess the performance

119
00:04:50,369 --> 00:04:51,498
of our operation.

120
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,816
But are you sure Gary's qualified for...

121
00:04:53,818 --> 00:04:55,168
responsibilities?

122
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,911
Of course, Mona.

123
00:04:56,913 --> 00:04:58,863
Gary Green is all the man we need.

124
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:12,853
Oh, my, what a big,
scary knife you've got.

125
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:16,097
I'd sooner be filleted
than do your bidding.

126
00:05:16,099 --> 00:05:19,175
This knife is not for you.

127
00:05:19,177 --> 00:05:21,552
It's for Raymond.

128
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:23,513
The human body is fascinating.

129
00:05:23,515 --> 00:05:25,181
Delicate, fragile.

130
00:05:26,518 --> 00:05:28,559
Did you know that if I
cut this artery right here,

131
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:30,561
it will take only a matter of minutes

132
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:32,897
before Ray's body goes into shock

133
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:35,858
and eventually expires?

134
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,086
Hey, big man.

135
00:05:37,089 --> 00:05:38,211
Come on. I know you're in there.

136
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:40,246
Snap out of it, eh?

137
00:05:40,248 --> 00:05:41,531
Ray's gone.

138
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:44,492
I've taken over his
body. We made a deal.

139
00:05:44,494 --> 00:05:46,553
And you of all people
should know what it means

140
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:48,913
to make a deal with a demon.

141
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:50,891
Now, if Ray was still in here,

142
00:05:50,893 --> 00:05:52,917
would he do this?

143
00:06:00,718 --> 00:06:02,547
I knew I could make you use your magic.

144
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:05,197
Great, yeah. So you got me.

145
00:06:06,391 --> 00:06:08,200
What's that big grin all about, eh?

146
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:09,818
Patience.

147
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,470
You'll see.

148
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,733
Huh, I always took you
to be more Springsteen

149
00:06:17,735 --> 00:06:19,444
than "The Rite of Spring."

150
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:23,072
It's not for me. It's...

151
00:06:23,074 --> 00:06:27,168
I read that classical
music is good for babies.

152
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:29,435
Wow, this is very, um, impressive.

153
00:06:30,491 --> 00:06:31,598
Yeah, I found a book about dragons

154
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,125
in Constantine's collection.

155
00:06:35,771 --> 00:06:37,771
"The egg must incubate under the mother

156
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:40,440
at her body temperature
lest the egg expire."

157
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:42,258
Yeah, I'm not gonna sit on that thing.

158
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,277
I figured as much. That's
why I got a heat lamp.

159
00:06:45,763 --> 00:06:50,933
We have to do everything possible

160
00:06:50,935 --> 00:06:53,478
to make sure nothing
bad happens to this egg.

161
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:57,740
- Hey.
- Hmm?

162
00:06:57,742 --> 00:06:59,868
The egg's gonna be okay.

163
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,202
I know it.

164
00:07:01,204 --> 00:07:03,446
Wait till Ray sees
that we have a dragon.

165
00:07:03,448 --> 00:07:05,975
- He's gonna love it.
- Yeah.

166
00:07:05,978 --> 00:07:07,311
<i>I've picked up an alert</i>

167
00:07:07,314 --> 00:07:09,468
<i>with Constantine's magical signature.</i>

168
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:11,954
That's them.

169
00:07:11,956 --> 00:07:14,624
<i>The signal is coming from
1.3 million years ago.</i>

170
00:07:14,626 --> 00:07:15,635
That's the Ice Age.

171
00:07:15,638 --> 00:07:16,765
<i>He's in the part of North America</i>

172
00:07:16,767 --> 00:07:19,036
<i>that would come to be
known as the Donner Pass,</i>

173
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,130
<i>named after a doomed group
of settlers in the 1800s</i>

174
00:07:21,132 --> 00:07:22,507
<i>who resorted to cannibalism</i>

175
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:23,966
<i>after their food supplies ran out.</i>

176
00:07:23,968 --> 00:07:26,969
There is such thing as too
much exposition, Gideon.

177
00:07:33,236 --> 00:07:36,646
Hah, there they are. Our heroes.

178
00:07:43,488 --> 00:07:46,840
<i>Captain Lance, thanks
for coming all this way.</i>

179
00:07:46,842 --> 00:07:48,574
<i>If you're looking for Ray,</i>

180
00:07:48,576 --> 00:07:50,293
he's, uh, checked out.

181
00:07:50,295 --> 00:07:51,869
Is Neron on comms?

182
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:53,346
<i>But if you'd like to join him,</i>

183
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:54,539
I can make arrangements.

184
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,332
Sara, open fire now.

185
00:07:56,334 --> 00:07:57,806
<i>This may be your only chance.</i>

186
00:07:57,809 --> 00:07:59,168
We can't fire. That's Ray.

187
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:01,095
Ray made a deal with a demon. He's gone.

188
00:08:01,097 --> 00:08:03,097
<i>We can't lose anyone
else to this bastard.</i>

189
00:08:03,099 --> 00:08:04,715
- <i>Do it.</i>
- What about you?

190
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:06,509
Blow us both to kingdom come.

191
00:08:06,511 --> 00:08:08,561
I'll be happy to go
to hell for the cause.

192
00:08:08,563 --> 00:08:10,888
Gideon, ready the blasters.

193
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:11,889
<i>Yes, Captain.</i>

194
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:13,258
Whoa, whoa. Hold up!

195
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:16,519
If we kill Neron in Ray's
body, we lose Ray forever.

196
00:08:16,521 --> 00:08:18,571
But if you let Neron walk,
then things are gonna get

197
00:08:18,573 --> 00:08:20,690
much, much worse. Trust me.

198
00:08:22,062 --> 00:08:24,569
Sara? Well, come on, boss.

199
00:08:26,957 --> 00:08:28,298
Something's wrong.

200
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,241
<i>Awaiting orders, Captain.</i>

201
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:31,551
Gideon...

202
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:33,253
Fire.

203
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,832
It's a trap!

204
00:08:50,217 --> 00:08:51,737
We gotta move! They're getting away!

205
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:53,006
Get us out of here, Gideon!

206
00:08:55,454 --> 00:08:56,486
That's not good.

207
00:08:56,488 --> 00:08:57,784
<i>By my calculations,</i>

208
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:00,865
<i>we're buried beneath 357
feet of ice and snow.</i>

209
00:09:00,867 --> 00:09:03,119
<i>Plus, our primary temporal
delineator has been rendered</i>

210
00:09:03,119 --> 00:09:04,866
<i>nonfunctional with the extreme weather.</i>

211
00:09:04,868 --> 00:09:06,775
Well, so that's it, then?
We're just snowed in?

212
00:09:06,777 --> 00:09:08,202
Yeah, at the Donner Pass.

213
00:09:08,204 --> 00:09:10,312
No one's turning me into beef jerky!

214
00:09:10,314 --> 00:09:13,023
Everyone calm down.
Gideon, hail the Bureau.

215
00:09:25,037 --> 00:09:26,795
Should we leave a voice mail?

216
00:09:26,797 --> 00:09:29,491
Ava will get the alert.
In the meantime, we wait.

217
00:09:29,494 --> 00:09:31,291
Gideon, how long until the ice thaws?

218
00:09:31,294 --> 00:09:34,344
<i>The Ice Age ends in 11,121 years.</i>

219
00:09:34,347 --> 00:09:35,538
All right, who we eating first?

220
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,713
'Cause shotgun, not.

221
00:09:36,715 --> 00:09:38,715
<i>Captain, we're running
on reserve power.</i>

222
00:09:38,717 --> 00:09:40,649
<i>I recommend disabling all
nonessential functions</i>

223
00:09:40,652 --> 00:09:42,560
<i>to conserve energy
for life support.</i>

224
00:09:42,563 --> 00:09:43,629
Do it.

225
00:09:43,631 --> 00:09:45,931
We need to be responsible
and conserve power.

226
00:09:45,933 --> 00:09:48,743
Cut off the main
generator, the fabricator,

227
00:09:48,745 --> 00:09:50,018
and the thermostat.

228
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,729
Neron is out there
with Ray and Constantine

229
00:09:52,731 --> 00:09:55,732
all because we fell for his
trap because you fired on Ray.

230
00:09:55,734 --> 00:09:57,609
And what was your plan, pretty?

231
00:09:57,611 --> 00:09:59,495
Beat him to death in a snowball fight?

232
00:09:59,497 --> 00:10:00,904
We were supposed to take him in,

233
00:10:00,906 --> 00:10:03,240
- not take him out, Mick.
- Ray's gone!

234
00:10:03,242 --> 00:10:05,167
When a team member goes dark,

235
00:10:05,169 --> 00:10:07,619
you end them before they end you.

236
00:10:11,592 --> 00:10:12,958
Rory, with me.

237
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,084
You made the call.

238
00:10:14,086 --> 00:10:15,627
You're helping us get out of here.

239
00:10:15,629 --> 00:10:18,272
- No problem.
- All right.

240
00:10:18,274 --> 00:10:20,799
Always assumed I'd go out alone, anyway.

241
00:10:26,473 --> 00:10:28,335
First you kill my friends,
and now you bring me

242
00:10:28,338 --> 00:10:29,808
to this miserable era.

243
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:32,027
Oh, Johnny, quit being such a crybaby.

244
00:10:32,029 --> 00:10:33,955
I just did what I had to do.

245
00:10:33,957 --> 00:10:35,864
Can't have your friends
getting in the way of us

246
00:10:35,866 --> 00:10:37,107
creating that door to hell.

247
00:10:37,109 --> 00:10:39,276
There's still no way I'm helping you.

248
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:41,987
Besides, the vortexes I
make are strictly one-way.

249
00:10:41,989 --> 00:10:44,039
They suck you in.

250
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:46,283
And don't you think, if my
magic was powerful enough

251
00:10:46,285 --> 00:10:48,785
to stabilize a vortex, I
wouldn't have saved Desmond

252
00:10:48,787 --> 00:10:50,162
or Astra?

253
00:10:50,164 --> 00:10:52,974
Yes, and that's why we're here.

254
00:10:52,976 --> 00:10:55,834
As powerful as your magic
is, you can always teach

255
00:10:55,836 --> 00:10:58,887
an old dog new tricks.

256
00:10:58,889 --> 00:11:01,315
And it's more than magic
that you need to learn.

257
00:11:01,317 --> 00:11:02,674
Oh, yeah, right.

258
00:11:02,676 --> 00:11:04,509
So I'm supposed to
learn something off one

259
00:11:04,511 --> 00:11:06,178
of these yokels, am I?

260
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,804
No, Johnny.

261
00:11:07,806 --> 00:11:09,681
Not from them.

262
00:11:09,683 --> 00:11:11,516
From a king.

263
00:11:14,855 --> 00:11:18,190
Hold on a minute. That
bloke's got my face.

264
00:11:18,192 --> 00:11:19,983
That's because he's your ancestor.

265
00:11:19,985 --> 00:11:22,837
King Konstentyn, ruler of these parts

266
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:25,506
and progenitor of
your magical bloodline.

267
00:11:28,344 --> 00:11:30,869
What kind of creature do
you think they're hunting?

268
00:11:30,871 --> 00:11:32,013
Can't be sure,

269
00:11:32,015 --> 00:11:33,922
but I'm guessing it wasn't rabbits.

270
00:11:33,924 --> 00:11:36,350
Make way for your king!

271
00:11:39,814 --> 00:11:41,880
Start paperwork, am I right?

272
00:11:41,882 --> 00:11:45,050
My forms keep getting
rejected because records show

273
00:11:45,052 --> 00:11:47,862
I'm 15 and living in
a mental institution.

274
00:11:47,864 --> 00:11:51,815
I forget that we don't have
normal problems anymore.

275
00:11:51,817 --> 00:11:54,869
Speaking of which, Ava's having Gary

276
00:11:54,871 --> 00:11:57,187
- do performance reviews.
- Okay.

277
00:11:57,189 --> 00:12:00,374
I mean, he's not my first
choice for... responsibilities,

278
00:12:00,376 --> 00:12:01,566
but don't we have bigger issues?

279
00:12:01,568 --> 00:12:02,665
Exactly.

280
00:12:02,668 --> 00:12:04,953
And when I pointed that
out, Ava shut me down.

281
00:12:04,955 --> 00:12:06,905
Not to stereotype, but I think a clone

282
00:12:06,907 --> 00:12:09,074
might have replaced her,
and we need to look into it.

283
00:12:09,076 --> 00:12:10,075
- No.
- Yes.

284
00:12:10,077 --> 00:12:11,076
- No.
- Yes.

285
00:12:11,078 --> 00:12:12,077
- No!
- Yes!

286
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,088
No! I just earned my freedom.

287
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:16,373
And I don't wanna get caught
going behind Ava's back.

288
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:17,749
You heard what she said.

289
00:12:17,751 --> 00:12:19,226
I need to focus on being a team player.

290
00:12:19,228 --> 00:12:22,045
She said Gary is all the man we need.

291
00:12:22,047 --> 00:12:24,089
That's not weird to you?

292
00:12:24,091 --> 00:12:26,225
Why is that weird?

293
00:12:26,227 --> 00:12:28,310
Gary Green <i>is</i> all the man we need.

294
00:12:32,575 --> 00:12:35,392
Okay, I will check on Gary,

295
00:12:35,394 --> 00:12:38,937
and you contact the Waverider
and see if Sara knows anything.

296
00:12:38,939 --> 00:12:41,156
- Mm-hmm.
- And then...

297
00:12:41,158 --> 00:12:44,067
we're gonna find out what form 37-C is.

298
00:12:44,069 --> 00:12:45,068
Okay.

299
00:12:52,336 --> 00:12:54,095
Ah, this is useless!

300
00:12:54,097 --> 00:12:55,954
Why don't we just blast a way out?

301
00:12:55,956 --> 00:12:57,765
<i>Using your heat gun in here, Mr. Rory,</i>

302
00:12:57,767 --> 00:12:59,466
<i>will deplete our low supply of oxygen.</i>

303
00:12:59,468 --> 00:13:00,676
Yeah, ease up, Mick.

304
00:13:00,678 --> 00:13:02,085
Last time you pulled the trigger,

305
00:13:02,087 --> 00:13:04,087
we ended up here.

306
00:13:04,089 --> 00:13:05,922
You're pissed at me
for firing on Haircut.

307
00:13:05,924 --> 00:13:07,424
Well, it's a good thing
that this Snart bloke

308
00:13:07,426 --> 00:13:09,301
kept a supply of
jackets, though, isn't it?

309
00:13:09,304 --> 00:13:10,868
They smell good too, actually.

310
00:13:10,871 --> 00:13:12,471
What is that? Is it sandalwood?

311
00:13:12,473 --> 00:13:13,930
Look, I'm pissed at you because that

312
00:13:13,932 --> 00:13:16,435
- wasn't your call to make.
- Someone had to make it.

313
00:13:16,438 --> 00:13:18,503
It was our only chance
to take out Neron.

314
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:20,103
I made the call you should have.

315
00:13:20,105 --> 00:13:22,289
All right, guys, come on.
Just pick away, will you?

316
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:23,648
No, this is good.

317
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:27,152
All of a sudden, now you
care about the mission?

318
00:13:27,154 --> 00:13:29,988
Where were you when Neron
took Ray in the first place?

319
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:31,656
Oh, you're gonna put that on me as well!

320
00:13:31,658 --> 00:13:33,742
All right, as much as I wanna
watch you guys duke it out,

321
00:13:33,744 --> 00:13:35,952
lets save it for when
we're not freezing to death.

322
00:13:35,954 --> 00:13:36,987
You know what?

323
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:40,173
Both of you off scamming
people at some book convention

324
00:13:40,176 --> 00:13:42,259
while there is a demon on our ship.

325
00:13:42,261 --> 00:13:44,628
Mm, let me get this straight, Captain.

326
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:47,723
You're the only one that
can have fun outside of this

327
00:13:47,725 --> 00:13:49,674
rusted bucket of bolts?

328
00:13:49,676 --> 00:13:51,967
All you do is spend
time with the girlfriend

329
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:54,971
and nothing's ever, ever your fault!

330
00:13:56,659 --> 00:13:57,658
You know what?

331
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,017
You have all the answers.

332
00:14:00,404 --> 00:14:01,820
You get us out of here.

333
00:14:03,908 --> 00:14:08,243
Oh, when I was a boy,
we used to run wild

334
00:14:08,245 --> 00:14:10,579
in these woods around the village.

335
00:14:10,581 --> 00:14:12,748
Not a care in the world.

336
00:14:14,084 --> 00:14:18,495
These same woods where
your children play today

337
00:14:18,497 --> 00:14:20,664
and where my hunting
party just encountered

338
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:24,852
another dangerous beast that
threatens not just our safety

339
00:14:24,854 --> 00:14:27,546
but our entire way of life.

340
00:14:27,548 --> 00:14:30,627
Oh, this bloke is right tedious.

341
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:32,092
Why are we here?

342
00:14:32,094 --> 00:14:34,052
Because I want you to learn

343
00:14:34,054 --> 00:14:36,443
that it was your ancestor
that created the rift

344
00:14:36,446 --> 00:14:39,033
between humans and magical creatures.

345
00:14:39,035 --> 00:14:41,276
And why would he do that?

346
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:44,854
Because fear is a powerful
source of energy for magic.

347
00:14:44,856 --> 00:14:47,399
The more he exploits these
creatures to stir up fear

348
00:14:47,401 --> 00:14:49,284
in his people, the more powerful

349
00:14:49,286 --> 00:14:51,078
his magic becomes.

350
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,029
I come from a long line of bastards,

351
00:14:53,031 --> 00:14:54,922
but not even we would resort to that.

352
00:14:54,925 --> 00:14:56,958
Because your kin are always so right.

353
00:14:56,961 --> 00:14:58,293
Yes.

354
00:14:58,295 --> 00:15:00,203
And if the king is sending
this creature to hell,

355
00:15:00,205 --> 00:15:02,965
then surely it deserves it.

356
00:15:02,967 --> 00:15:04,749
Do you really think
that everyone in hell

357
00:15:04,751 --> 00:15:06,209
deserves to be there?

358
00:15:06,211 --> 00:15:07,877
What about Astra

359
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:09,713
or Raymond Palmer

360
00:15:09,715 --> 00:15:11,089
or my Tabitha?

361
00:15:11,091 --> 00:15:14,050
This is your opportunity
to make things right,

362
00:15:14,052 --> 00:15:15,644
starting with her.

363
00:15:15,647 --> 00:15:17,705
You know, if your plan is to guilt me

364
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,950
into doing what you want
by showing me the sins

365
00:15:19,953 --> 00:15:23,560
of my forefather, it
ain't working, sunshine.

366
00:15:23,562 --> 00:15:25,770
But to another.

367
00:15:25,772 --> 00:15:29,250
Behold the unholy beast!

368
00:15:31,737 --> 00:15:33,893
Hold on a minute. That's a Púca.

369
00:15:33,896 --> 00:15:38,241
May not look threatening, but sometimes

370
00:15:38,243 --> 00:15:42,304
in order to see the true
nature of a creature,

371
00:15:42,306 --> 00:15:44,456
one must draw it out.

372
00:15:45,751 --> 00:15:47,463
No, no, no. He's got it all wrong.

373
00:15:47,466 --> 00:15:48,677
They aren't evil.

374
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:51,463
Guess your bloodline isn't as
righteous as you think it is.

375
00:15:51,466 --> 00:15:53,649
He's clearly misinformed.

376
00:15:53,651 --> 00:15:55,634
Well, if you think
that, maybe you should go

377
00:15:55,636 --> 00:15:57,469
and have a chat with the king.

378
00:15:57,471 --> 00:16:00,305
You are truly blessed that I am here,

379
00:16:00,307 --> 00:16:04,401
for I alone can save
you from these monsters.

380
00:16:04,403 --> 00:16:07,812
And tonight at the rise of the low moon,

381
00:16:07,814 --> 00:16:12,960
I will banish this
creature straight to hell.

382
00:16:22,155 --> 00:16:24,248
<i>Agent Powell, please report to my office</i>

383
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,582
<i>for your performance review.</i>

384
00:16:37,154 --> 00:16:40,005
Just need a signal on the Waverider.

385
00:16:41,341 --> 00:16:42,599
That's weird.

386
00:16:46,188 --> 00:16:48,338
What are you doing in here?

387
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:52,609
Uh, just thought I would
check on the timeline.

388
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:54,885
Yep, looks good.

389
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:56,273
You have clearance for this?

390
00:16:56,276 --> 00:16:58,106
Have you completed
your performance review?

391
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,479
Yes, I've had my performance review.

392
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:07,291
And how did it go?

393
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:13,488
Gary Green is all the man we need.

394
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,707
Gary Green is all the man we need.

395
00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:17,283
Mm.

396
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:24,516
Nora!

397
00:17:24,518 --> 00:17:26,143
You were right. We have to talk.

398
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:27,669
But we can't do it here.

399
00:17:30,298 --> 00:17:31,673
The heat lamp must have turned off

400
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:33,800
when Sara shut down the generator.

401
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:36,636
It's okay, Wickstable.
You're gonna be okay.

402
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:38,063
What... what did you call it?

403
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:40,807
Wickstable.

404
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:43,327
The drawing I made of
Heyworld when I was a kid,

405
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:45,329
the one that inspired
my dad, the dragon in it,

406
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:47,333
I named it Wickstable.

407
00:17:47,336 --> 00:17:49,190
I thought we could just name it that.

408
00:17:49,192 --> 00:17:51,150
But I'm open to other ideas.

409
00:17:51,152 --> 00:17:53,986
No, uh, I-I like... I like Wickstable.

410
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:58,825
Our little Wicksty.

411
00:18:00,995 --> 00:18:02,328
I can't believe I'm about to say this,

412
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:04,003
but I think it needs
skin-to-skin contact

413
00:18:04,006 --> 00:18:05,590
like the book said.

414
00:18:11,339 --> 00:18:14,465
I think it's working.

415
00:18:16,103 --> 00:18:18,177
Hey, uh, why does it
feel like we skipped past

416
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:22,056
all the fun stuff into, you know, this?

417
00:18:22,058 --> 00:18:23,891
We can still do the fun stuff.

418
00:18:29,774 --> 00:18:31,023
What about the egg?

419
00:18:31,025 --> 00:18:33,751
Um, there's other ways
we could create heat.

420
00:18:33,754 --> 00:18:35,429
Seriously, dude?

421
00:18:37,031 --> 00:18:38,156
Yeah.

422
00:18:39,367 --> 00:18:41,051
Come on, Gideon.

423
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:43,703
There's gotta be a way
to boost the engines.

424
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:46,539
Ray would know how to read this.

425
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:49,917
How much longer do we
have on life support?

426
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,229
<i>Power reserves are at 34 hours, Captain.</i>

427
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:55,089
- Hey, you got a second?
- Not now, Rory.

428
00:18:55,091 --> 00:18:58,926
I actually came here
to apologize for, uh,

429
00:18:58,928 --> 00:19:00,570
blowing up before.

430
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:04,324
Wow, that's... Thank you.

431
00:19:04,326 --> 00:19:07,744
- And I should have never...
- And another thing!

432
00:19:09,823 --> 00:19:12,323
Give it up, Charlie.

433
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,672
Why were you wearing my face?

434
00:19:18,674 --> 00:19:20,406
And were you about to apologize?

435
00:19:20,408 --> 00:19:22,617
Only because Charlie was catfishing me.

436
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:23,819
All right, shut up.

437
00:19:23,821 --> 00:19:25,620
Do you think Ray would
be fighting right now?

438
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:27,839
No, he would be trying
to get us out of here.

439
00:19:30,352 --> 00:19:32,960
Yeah, you're right.
He's always got a plan.

440
00:19:32,962 --> 00:19:34,104
It's annoying.

441
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:35,772
All right, let's search Ray's quarters,

442
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:37,757
see if we can find something helpful.

443
00:19:42,522 --> 00:19:44,731
Thanks.

444
00:19:44,733 --> 00:19:45,932
Hmm.

445
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:49,769
I tried talking to Ava,
and all she'd say was,

446
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:51,938
"Gary Green is all the man we need."

447
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,698
Gary must be controlling
the Bureau somehow.

448
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,441
It's those performance reviews.

449
00:19:55,443 --> 00:19:57,202
If we can find out how he's doing it,

450
00:19:57,204 --> 00:19:59,445
maybe we can find a way
to snap them out of it.

451
00:19:59,447 --> 00:20:00,830
I can try tapping into my powers,

452
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:02,207
see if I can read him.

453
00:20:02,209 --> 00:20:03,967
- If I can get to his office...
- No!

454
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:05,210
We're all we have left.

455
00:20:05,212 --> 00:20:07,870
We can't risk losing each other.

456
00:20:07,872 --> 00:20:09,288
I've got it.

457
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:11,624
We'll tell Gary you
found some security issues

458
00:20:11,626 --> 00:20:12,976
in the containment cells.

459
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:16,963
You walk him over here like this.

460
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:19,861
Then I'll close the cell
doors and you courier out,

461
00:20:19,864 --> 00:20:22,319
- trapping him.
- That's a great idea.

462
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:28,432
Yeah, just like that.

463
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:33,071
Okay, it works.

464
00:20:33,073 --> 00:20:34,438
You can let me out now.

465
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,190
I'm sorry. I can't do that right now.

466
00:20:36,192 --> 00:20:38,320
Sure, you can. Just use the hand thing.

467
00:20:38,323 --> 00:20:41,028
No, Mona, you need a time-out.

468
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:43,197
Gary Green is all the man we need.

469
00:20:43,199 --> 00:20:44,508
No.

470
00:20:47,161 --> 00:20:50,347
Go and tell the others to
prepare the ritual for tonight.

471
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:52,707
As you wish, my lord.

472
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:55,685
You're wasting your time,
focusing on that monster.

473
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:58,004
A Púca only reflects
the person it's with.

474
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:00,298
It's only angry because
you scared the fur off it.

475
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,026
That creature doesn't
deserve to go to hell.

476
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:06,696
I see not why I should heed
the advice of a stranger.

477
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:10,867
Then perhaps you will heed
the advice... of your kin.

478
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,901
I know not of any kin
outside of this village.

479
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:22,236
And yet the similarities
of your features...

480
00:21:22,238 --> 00:21:25,364
I'm a cousin from afar and a
practitioner of magic like you.

481
00:21:25,366 --> 00:21:28,200
If you want to rid your
village of a real monster,

482
00:21:28,202 --> 00:21:30,244
then I know of a demon in our midst

483
00:21:30,246 --> 00:21:32,714
that we can banish together.

484
00:21:32,716 --> 00:21:34,558
A demon?

485
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,083
In my village?

486
00:21:37,938 --> 00:21:40,138
Well, then lead the way, my kin.

487
00:21:45,145 --> 00:21:47,219
But this face stealer
with the other creature.

488
00:21:47,221 --> 00:21:48,405
Aye, my liege.

489
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:50,097
Hell shall have two more guests

490
00:21:50,099 --> 00:21:51,679
by the end of the night.

491
00:21:54,955 --> 00:21:57,989
"Cards to Save the Timeline:

492
00:21:57,989 --> 00:22:01,875
a team-building card
game by Ray Palmer."

493
00:22:01,877 --> 00:22:06,138
Ah, I miss hating him.

494
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,955
You remember that night when we all met,

495
00:22:07,957 --> 00:22:10,208
standing up on that
rooftop, and Rip told us

496
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:12,064
that we were gonna be legends?

497
00:22:12,067 --> 00:22:15,505
Mm-hmm, embarrassing.

498
00:22:15,507 --> 00:22:17,507
You know what?

499
00:22:17,509 --> 00:22:20,712
We're the last of the originals.

500
00:22:20,715 --> 00:22:21,969
Weird.

501
00:22:21,971 --> 00:22:23,897
Yeah, weird.

502
00:22:26,851 --> 00:22:28,568
Legends were different back then.

503
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:30,561
We were different back then.

504
00:22:32,357 --> 00:22:35,500
Look, I know that book convention

505
00:22:35,503 --> 00:22:36,910
was important to you.

506
00:22:36,912 --> 00:22:39,987
And I'm really glad that you got to go.

507
00:22:39,989 --> 00:22:41,656
I'm glad you have Ava.

508
00:22:41,658 --> 00:22:43,508
Thanks.

509
00:22:44,994 --> 00:22:47,829
Guess we're growing up...

510
00:22:47,831 --> 00:22:50,182
and hopefully not growing apart.

511
00:22:52,502 --> 00:22:54,836
Ah, here we are.

512
00:22:54,838 --> 00:22:56,295
What is it?

513
00:22:56,297 --> 00:22:58,523
"Ray Palmer's Survival Guide."

514
00:22:58,525 --> 00:23:00,258
Let me see this.

515
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:02,435
Oh, hey.

516
00:23:02,437 --> 00:23:05,605
"What to do if you're
caught in an avalanche."

517
00:23:05,607 --> 00:23:07,032
Uh-huh, what does it say?

518
00:23:07,034 --> 00:23:09,534
Yeah, we've already tried all of these.

519
00:23:09,536 --> 00:23:12,687
"If all fails, remember
you still have each other,

520
00:23:12,689 --> 00:23:14,689
so enjoy that as long as it lasts."

521
00:23:14,691 --> 00:23:16,616
Ah, we're dead.

522
00:23:16,618 --> 00:23:19,527
Yeah. Maybe.

523
00:23:25,535 --> 00:23:27,552
Hey, it's all right, little one.

524
00:23:27,554 --> 00:23:28,870
I don't bite.

525
00:23:28,872 --> 00:23:31,556
Ah!

526
00:23:31,558 --> 00:23:34,208
I see your talk went well.

527
00:23:35,742 --> 00:23:38,045
Knew you'd be here.

528
00:23:38,047 --> 00:23:42,049
Ah, so I come from a long
line of bloody bastards.

529
00:23:42,051 --> 00:23:44,093
Big reveal.

530
00:23:46,222 --> 00:23:49,056
Have you even considered
what it's really gonna be like

531
00:23:49,058 --> 00:23:52,772
for you in hell with all those
pissed-off folks you sent there

532
00:23:52,775 --> 00:23:55,772
just waiting for you?

533
00:23:55,774 --> 00:23:57,231
Including my Tabitha.

534
00:23:57,233 --> 00:23:58,917
Tabitha.

535
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:00,875
Who is this bird, anyway?

536
00:24:00,878 --> 00:24:02,495
Why is she so important?

537
00:24:02,497 --> 00:24:05,239
- Who is she?
- Yeah.

538
00:24:05,241 --> 00:24:07,116
You're just like your ancestor.

539
00:24:07,118 --> 00:24:08,910
So convinced you're always right.

540
00:24:08,912 --> 00:24:11,504
You don't even know
who you're sending away.

541
00:24:11,506 --> 00:24:14,707
Fitting that he's about
to do the same to you.

542
00:24:14,709 --> 00:24:18,052
But once you see how
powerful magic can be

543
00:24:18,054 --> 00:24:21,088
when fueled by fear,
you can save yourself

544
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:22,774
from being sucked to hell.

545
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:29,522
Oh, you would love for me
to stabilize that vortex,

546
00:24:29,524 --> 00:24:31,024
wouldn't you?

547
00:24:31,026 --> 00:24:32,525
You see, the thing is,

548
00:24:32,527 --> 00:24:34,861
I'm not afraid of going to hell.

549
00:24:34,863 --> 00:24:38,957
I've always counted on the fact
that I'd end up there one day

550
00:24:38,959 --> 00:24:41,126
no matter what.

551
00:24:41,128 --> 00:24:44,779
And what about this
innocent creature beside you?

552
00:24:50,137 --> 00:24:54,473
Well, I guess I'm just a
bloody bastard, then, aren't I?

553
00:25:02,483 --> 00:25:04,182
What's the bad news now?

554
00:25:04,184 --> 00:25:05,859
Oh, no bad news.

555
00:25:05,861 --> 00:25:07,802
And no more fighting.

556
00:25:07,804 --> 00:25:10,161
Gideon, fire up the ship.

557
00:25:10,164 --> 00:25:11,806
<i>If I do that, life support capacity</i>

558
00:25:11,808 --> 00:25:13,349
<i>will be reduced by half.</i>

559
00:25:13,351 --> 00:25:14,659
You heard me, Gideon.

560
00:25:14,661 --> 00:25:17,854
Turn on the fabricators
and turn on the heat.

561
00:25:17,856 --> 00:25:22,984
I'm thinking s'mores,
maybe some hot cocoa.

562
00:25:22,986 --> 00:25:24,202
The captain's gone mad.

563
00:25:24,204 --> 00:25:27,029
She's not mad. She's right.

564
00:25:27,031 --> 00:25:28,489
I could go for a s'more.

565
00:25:28,491 --> 00:25:30,166
Look, Ray would want us to have faith

566
00:25:30,168 --> 00:25:31,534
that we will escape.

567
00:25:31,536 --> 00:25:33,586
He wouldn't want us cold and miserable.

568
00:25:33,588 --> 00:25:37,549
So right now, we are going
to enjoy our time together.

569
00:25:37,551 --> 00:25:39,041
Let's go.

570
00:25:39,043 --> 00:25:41,686
Finally. Let's get some music going.

571
00:25:44,858 --> 00:25:49,552
Who's gonna bring me
food if I'm stuck in here?

572
00:25:49,554 --> 00:25:52,179
This is how I'm gonna die, isn't it?

573
00:25:52,181 --> 00:25:55,850
Without any books or laughter

574
00:25:55,852 --> 00:25:58,561
in the basement of a
government building?

575
00:25:58,563 --> 00:26:00,280
Whoa.

576
00:26:17,966 --> 00:26:21,801
You're right. I'm not alone.

577
00:26:21,803 --> 00:26:23,803
I have you.

578
00:26:29,403 --> 00:26:32,612
I'm sorry you're stuck
here with me, little one.

579
00:26:32,614 --> 00:26:36,182
Ah, you should be out there
in the woods, frolicking about.

580
00:26:36,184 --> 00:26:40,102
Or whatever it is you
Púcas get up to these days.

581
00:26:41,415 --> 00:26:43,856
You know, to tell you the truth,

582
00:26:43,858 --> 00:26:46,418
I'm bloody well terrified.

583
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:48,444
No.

584
00:26:48,446 --> 00:26:51,256
It's not the eternity of torture

585
00:26:51,258 --> 00:26:54,867
or the people who are after my head, no.

586
00:26:54,869 --> 00:27:01,341
It's that I'll have to
watch Raymond and Astra

587
00:27:01,343 --> 00:27:05,145
and all the others I've failed
be tortured along with me.

588
00:27:06,389 --> 00:27:08,965
Even led the Legends to their death.

589
00:27:11,135 --> 00:27:12,969
And you're next in line.

590
00:27:12,971 --> 00:27:14,971
Yeah, that's right.

591
00:27:14,973 --> 00:27:17,190
You sense the rottenness
inside me, don't you?

592
00:27:17,192 --> 00:27:20,142
No better than the bloody king.

593
00:27:29,612 --> 00:27:32,130
Why would you heal a bastard like me?

594
00:27:36,786 --> 00:27:38,303
Up with you.

595
00:27:38,305 --> 00:27:39,829
Time to see the king.

596
00:27:41,124 --> 00:27:42,807
All right, then, little one.

597
00:27:42,809 --> 00:27:45,477
Let's go see what this
party's all about, shall we?

598
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:53,926
We live in a world of
wonder and amazement.

599
00:27:53,928 --> 00:27:59,157
At times, it's beautiful, breathtaking.

600
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:03,352
At other times, cruel, dangerous...

601
00:28:05,073 --> 00:28:07,165
And monstrous.

602
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:16,416
Before you are two foul
creatures of the dark,

603
00:28:16,418 --> 00:28:19,201
one a grotesque woodland creature

604
00:28:19,203 --> 00:28:21,203
that would not hesitate
to tear out your heart,

605
00:28:21,205 --> 00:28:24,165
the other an imposter,

606
00:28:24,167 --> 00:28:26,333
a wielder of the dark arts

607
00:28:26,335 --> 00:28:31,505
that would usurp my very body and soul.

608
00:28:31,507 --> 00:28:35,676
Now, my people, I seek your wisdom

609
00:28:35,678 --> 00:28:38,054
in these matters.

610
00:28:38,056 --> 00:28:42,534
What would you have me do
with such wretched beasts?

611
00:28:42,536 --> 00:28:44,786
To hell! To hell!

612
00:28:44,796 --> 00:28:48,545
To hell! To hell! To hell!

613
00:29:04,773 --> 00:29:06,408
We're very excited for you to receive

614
00:29:06,433 --> 00:29:07,850
your performance review.

615
00:29:07,852 --> 00:29:11,928
But what actually
happens at the meeting?

616
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:14,097
Feel free to give me any spoilers.

617
00:29:15,153 --> 00:29:18,846
Don't worry. I had my doubts too.

618
00:29:18,848 --> 00:29:21,232
But then I met with Gary and realized

619
00:29:21,234 --> 00:29:23,326
Gary Green is all the man we need.

620
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:26,645
Gary Green is all the man we need.

621
00:29:32,412 --> 00:29:33,694
Bye.

622
00:29:33,696 --> 00:29:37,156
Please step forward, Ms. Wu.

623
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:41,752
Take a seat. Make yourself comfortable.

624
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:47,041
Mint?

625
00:29:47,043 --> 00:29:49,001
Eh, no, thanks.

626
00:29:49,003 --> 00:29:50,627
Don't mind if I do.

627
00:29:53,433 --> 00:29:56,175
Let's see.

628
00:29:56,177 --> 00:29:57,601
Mm.

629
00:29:57,603 --> 00:29:59,270
I see you've made quite an impression

630
00:29:59,272 --> 00:30:01,764
in your brief time here.

631
00:30:01,766 --> 00:30:04,701
But lately you've been slacking off.

632
00:30:06,187 --> 00:30:10,312
It says right here
you've been very disloyal

633
00:30:10,315 --> 00:30:12,333
to the Time Bureau.

634
00:30:12,335 --> 00:30:14,210
Not yet, Wolfie.

635
00:30:15,696 --> 00:30:17,940
Okay, I'll judge this round.

636
00:30:17,943 --> 00:30:19,943
You and your team are
stuck in a trash compactor

637
00:30:19,946 --> 00:30:22,872
in an impromptu and possibly
fatal homage to "Star Wars."

638
00:30:22,875 --> 00:30:24,025
What do you do?

639
00:30:24,028 --> 00:30:27,164
Boom, that's the one.

640
00:30:27,166 --> 00:30:29,091
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
- Yep.

641
00:30:29,093 --> 00:30:30,509
Ooh, gonna have to go with,

642
00:30:30,511 --> 00:30:32,419
"Steel up as Sara scales a wall."

643
00:30:32,421 --> 00:30:34,922
- Another point for me.
- Favoritism!

644
00:30:34,924 --> 00:30:36,882
Why would I display favoritism?

645
00:30:36,884 --> 00:30:39,384
'Cause you two are obviously shagging.

646
00:30:39,386 --> 00:30:40,928
- What?
- Hmm?

647
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:42,572
Yeah.

648
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:46,600
Yes, finally! This is great.

649
00:30:46,603 --> 00:30:48,224
Maybe you guys won't be so weird now.

650
00:30:48,227 --> 00:30:50,580
Okay, I'll judge next.

651
00:30:50,582 --> 00:30:54,858
A teammate turns on you,
lost to the dark side.

652
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,068
What do you do?

653
00:30:58,072 --> 00:31:00,280
Mm.

654
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:05,634
"Escape via musical number."

655
00:31:05,637 --> 00:31:06,994
Not this time.

656
00:31:06,997 --> 00:31:09,957
"Fabricate eveningwear
and infiltrate a party."

657
00:31:09,959 --> 00:31:12,251
You guys know I love a good party sneak.

658
00:31:12,253 --> 00:31:14,771
"Don't give up on each
other. Work together.

659
00:31:14,773 --> 00:31:17,422
You're more than a
team. You are a family."

660
00:31:21,971 --> 00:31:23,428
Well, I guess that
card's the winner, then.

661
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:25,430
Point to Charlie. I'm on the board.

662
00:31:28,269 --> 00:31:30,119
- The hell was that?
<i>- Due to your reckless use</i>

663
00:31:30,121 --> 00:31:31,737
<i>of our rapidly depleting energy,</i>

664
00:31:31,739 --> 00:31:33,447
<i>internal temperature
of the ship has melted</i>

665
00:31:33,449 --> 00:31:36,033
<i>the surrounding ice enough
to shake the ship loose.</i>

666
00:31:36,035 --> 00:31:37,192
What do we do?

667
00:31:37,194 --> 00:31:38,652
We work as a team.

668
00:31:38,654 --> 00:31:41,112
Zari, engine room. Get
the thrusters back online.

669
00:31:41,115 --> 00:31:43,157
Seal the cargo bay. You two with me.

670
00:31:48,664 --> 00:31:50,881
My dear people!

671
00:31:50,883 --> 00:31:54,143
I hear your cries and feel your anger.

672
00:31:54,145 --> 00:31:56,646
And therefore, by your command,

673
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:59,006
I send these creatures

674
00:31:59,008 --> 00:32:00,271
where they belong.

675
00:32:00,274 --> 00:32:01,508
Straight to hell!

676
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:04,368
Straight to hell! Straight to hell!

677
00:32:04,371 --> 00:32:06,656
Straight to hell! Straight to hell!

678
00:32:20,755 --> 00:32:25,007
Begone, you unclean beasts!

679
00:32:33,334 --> 00:32:36,927
Come on, Johnny. You
know what you need to do.

680
00:32:36,929 --> 00:32:40,297
Oh, bollocks.

681
00:32:54,063 --> 00:32:58,398
Here. Run, run.

682
00:33:00,879 --> 00:33:03,111
What have you done?

683
00:33:03,113 --> 00:33:05,298
I've used your own magic against you.

684
00:33:13,415 --> 00:33:16,667
We may be kin, but we are not the same.

685
00:33:22,174 --> 00:33:25,592
Now, you may not agree with my methods,

686
00:33:25,594 --> 00:33:29,104
but I will always protect my people.

687
00:33:47,926 --> 00:33:50,376
Now, the question is, Ms. Wu,

688
00:33:50,378 --> 00:33:53,787
what shall we do about your disloyalty?

689
00:33:53,789 --> 00:33:56,748
Uh, maybe...

690
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:59,793
I lose my snack room
privileges for a week.

691
00:33:59,795 --> 00:34:01,962
Oh, no! Not my almonds!

692
00:34:01,964 --> 00:34:05,274
Oh, I wouldn't worry about your almonds.

693
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:07,443
Because as I'm sure you've heard,

694
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:10,595
Gary Green is all the man you need.

695
00:34:10,597 --> 00:34:14,433
Now, gaze into the nipple.

696
00:34:19,773 --> 00:34:22,274
Wolfie! Now!

697
00:34:22,276 --> 00:34:23,867
What's a Wolfie?

698
00:34:28,708 --> 00:34:30,633
W-W-W-Wolfie?

699
00:34:37,249 --> 00:34:38,532
Bravo.

700
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:41,001
I knew you could exploit
fear to make yourself

701
00:34:41,003 --> 00:34:42,143
even more powerful.

702
00:34:42,143 --> 00:34:43,834
Well, it looks like
you taught this old dog

703
00:34:43,836 --> 00:34:45,719
some new tricks after all.

704
00:34:45,721 --> 00:34:49,006
But now I'm gonna use those
new tricks to strike you down.

705
00:34:49,008 --> 00:34:52,134
You know, I do have a
few tricks of my own.

706
00:34:57,641 --> 00:34:59,808
<i>We're running on very low reserve power.</i>

707
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:01,869
<i>The odds of us successfully
pushing through the avalanche</i>

708
00:35:01,871 --> 00:35:04,146
<i>above us are 3,720 to 1.</i>

709
00:35:04,148 --> 00:35:05,981
Never tell me the odds, Gideon.

710
00:35:05,983 --> 00:35:07,649
Everyone hold on tight.

711
00:35:07,651 --> 00:35:09,193
Oh, this better work.

712
00:35:09,195 --> 00:35:10,360
It will.

713
00:35:13,007 --> 00:35:14,957
- You got Wicksty?
- Yeah, I'm not letting go.

714
00:35:20,206 --> 00:35:22,497
Come on, come on.

715
00:35:26,545 --> 00:35:28,146
- Boom!
- Whoo!

716
00:35:28,148 --> 00:35:29,163
Yes!

717
00:35:29,166 --> 00:35:31,022
<i>All systems are back online, Captain.</i>

718
00:35:31,025 --> 00:35:32,382
Fantastic, Gideon.

719
00:35:32,384 --> 00:35:35,319
Now let's go find Constantine and Ray.

720
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:46,127
Oh, damn executive privacy button.

721
00:35:46,129 --> 00:35:47,755
Uh, hey.

722
00:35:47,755 --> 00:35:50,038
Can you do me a solid and
press that button over there,

723
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,164
if you...

724
00:35:52,252 --> 00:35:54,752
Do you really think I'm letting
you get out of here alive?

725
00:35:57,026 --> 00:35:58,172
Help!

726
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,968
Get away from him, you beast!

727
00:36:14,399 --> 00:36:15,523
What happened?

728
00:36:15,525 --> 00:36:17,617
I don't know.

729
00:36:17,619 --> 00:36:21,738
But I'm guessing he had
something to do with it.

730
00:36:47,057 --> 00:36:49,724
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

731
00:36:49,726 --> 00:36:51,743
It may be too late to save Ray

732
00:36:51,745 --> 00:36:54,771
or Desmond or the Legends.

733
00:36:54,773 --> 00:36:57,490
But at least I'll get to send
you back where you belong.

734
00:37:04,124 --> 00:37:06,282
Oh, you bastards. You did it.

735
00:37:06,284 --> 00:37:07,593
You bloody survived.

736
00:37:07,595 --> 00:37:10,670
I've never been so happy
to be wrong in my life.

737
00:37:10,672 --> 00:37:12,538
Don't do it, John. Don't kill him.

738
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:14,799
Don't give up on Haircut.

739
00:37:14,801 --> 00:37:16,843
What are you gonna do, Johnny?

740
00:37:16,845 --> 00:37:18,345
You're all out of moves.

741
00:37:23,593 --> 00:37:24,759
No, I'm not.

742
00:37:29,191 --> 00:37:31,766
I'll see you lovely lot at the end.

743
00:37:31,768 --> 00:37:33,452
I'm gonna save Ray.

744
00:37:38,775 --> 00:37:40,108
John!

745
00:38:06,979 --> 00:38:08,136
The magic-o-meter's picking up

746
00:38:08,138 --> 00:38:09,637
strange activity on the ground.

747
00:38:12,392 --> 00:38:14,976
Tabitha, show yourself.

748
00:38:19,983 --> 00:38:21,190
Ah.

749
00:38:21,192 --> 00:38:24,077
So wonderful to be back.

750
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:26,838
Brimstone was so awful
for my complexion.

751
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,882
Oh, but you look ravishing, my love.

752
00:38:31,327 --> 00:38:33,828
Hold on. Is he kissing...

753
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:35,830
Oh, the Fairy Godmother.

754
00:38:35,832 --> 00:38:37,590
Is that tongue?

755
00:38:37,592 --> 00:38:39,542
More singing.

756
00:38:39,544 --> 00:38:41,428
We're so screwed.

757
00:38:44,007 --> 00:38:45,882
Come with me, my pet.

758
00:38:45,884 --> 00:38:47,884
Let's find you a new host.

759
00:38:49,012 --> 00:38:50,845
It's his nipple.

760
00:38:52,441 --> 00:38:55,349
He tried to hypnotize
Mona with his nipple.

761
00:38:57,395 --> 00:38:59,854
His nipple?

762
00:38:59,856 --> 00:39:02,774
Neron gave you back your
nipple which became bad in hell,

763
00:39:02,776 --> 00:39:04,916
which is now poisoning your
mind and making you evil,

764
00:39:04,919 --> 00:39:07,195
and that's why you came
back to the Time Bureau...

765
00:39:07,197 --> 00:39:09,197
So that you could nip-notize everyone

766
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:11,883
- and Neron could take over.
- Yeah.

767
00:39:11,885 --> 00:39:14,961
You will do no more
harm with your nipple!

768
00:39:16,807 --> 00:39:19,540
No, no, no, no!

769
00:39:19,542 --> 00:39:21,042
No, no, please no!

770
00:39:28,769 --> 00:39:30,444
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

771
00:39:30,446 --> 00:39:32,103
It wasn't me. It was my nipple.

772
00:39:32,105 --> 00:39:33,137
I swear.

773
00:39:36,726 --> 00:39:38,693
Save me!

774
00:39:38,695 --> 00:39:40,228
As you wish.

775
00:39:48,088 --> 00:39:49,829
You have to go.

776
00:39:49,831 --> 00:39:51,380
Tell the Legends what's going on.

777
00:39:51,382 --> 00:39:53,833
- Wait, what about you?
- I'm not leaving Mona behind.

778
00:39:53,835 --> 00:39:55,260
Always knew you were a team player.

779
00:39:59,767 --> 00:40:01,624
Ava. You okay?

780
00:40:01,626 --> 00:40:03,751
It's a long story, but
Gary took over the Bureau.

781
00:40:03,753 --> 00:40:05,103
He nip-notized everyone.

782
00:40:05,105 --> 00:40:06,646
Yeah, you're gonna have to explain that.

783
00:40:06,648 --> 00:40:08,422
The germ turned.

784
00:40:08,424 --> 00:40:10,424
Well, it's not just
him. It's Neron and...

785
00:40:10,426 --> 00:40:12,185
The Fairy Godmother, Tabitha.

786
00:40:12,187 --> 00:40:13,353
She's Tabitha?

787
00:40:13,355 --> 00:40:15,030
Yeah, you missed a lot.

788
00:40:15,032 --> 00:40:16,448
And Ray is still in hell.

789
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:17,690
I know he hasn't given up,

790
00:40:17,692 --> 00:40:19,489
so we're not gonna give up on him.

791
00:40:19,492 --> 00:40:21,152
Now, let's do this...

792
00:40:21,154 --> 00:40:22,904
for Ray.

793
00:40:57,157 --> 00:40:58,973
Bloody hell.

794
00:41:05,959 --> 00:41:10,249
