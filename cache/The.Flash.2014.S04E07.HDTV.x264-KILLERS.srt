1
00:00:00,157 --> 00:00:01,668
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:01,671 --> 00:00:04,343
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:04,346 --> 00:00:07,400
To the outside world, I am an
ordinary forensic scientist.

4
00:00:07,402 --> 00:00:10,203
But secretly with the help of
my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

5
00:00:10,205 --> 00:00:13,139
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

6
00:00:13,141 --> 00:00:15,374
But I became lost in time.

7
00:00:15,376 --> 00:00:18,185
It took everything in my friends'
power to bring me back.

8
00:00:18,188 --> 00:00:21,492
And in doing so, our world
was opened up to new threats.

9
00:00:21,495 --> 00:00:24,016
And I'm the only one
fast enough to stop them.

10
00:00:24,018 --> 00:00:26,414
I am the Flash.

11
00:00:27,422 --> 00:00:28,773
Previously on "The Flash"...

12
00:00:28,776 --> 00:00:31,022
Events will align that
allow Team Flash a chance

13
00:00:31,025 --> 00:00:32,091
to discover your identity.

14
00:00:32,093 --> 00:00:33,320
It is of no concern.

15
00:00:33,323 --> 00:00:34,981
I could whip up a predictive algorithm.

16
00:00:34,984 --> 00:00:35,992
Jah, jah, jah.

17
00:00:35,995 --> 00:00:37,749
Run it through my quantum cerebral chip,

18
00:00:37,752 --> 00:00:39,418
we'll find them in no time.

19
00:00:39,421 --> 00:00:41,967
If you've miscalculated
by even a decimal...

20
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,187
There is not a decimal, a fraction,

21
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:48,473
an infinitesimal variable
beyond my thought.

22
00:00:48,476 --> 00:00:50,531
The name we're looking
for is Clifford DeVoe.

23
00:00:50,534 --> 00:00:52,601
92% match to our psychological profile,

24
00:00:52,604 --> 00:00:53,997
no other DeVoe comes close.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,953
Can I help you?

26
00:00:54,956 --> 00:00:57,403
We were just hoping to
talk with Clifford DeVoe.

27
00:00:57,406 --> 00:00:58,289
Is he here?

28
00:00:58,292 --> 00:01:00,515
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
How may I be of help?

29
00:01:05,693 --> 00:01:07,793
Effects...

30
00:01:07,795 --> 00:01:09,362
Of...

31
00:01:09,364 --> 00:01:11,564
Taoism.

32
00:01:11,566 --> 00:01:14,267
All right, uh, class.

33
00:01:14,269 --> 00:01:19,105
Write your, um, essays
on... this list of topics.

34
00:01:19,107 --> 00:01:21,641
You have two weeks to complete them.

35
00:01:21,643 --> 00:01:24,944
Does... does anyone have
their notes from earlier?

36
00:01:24,946 --> 00:01:26,913
I'm afraid I can't
read my own handwriting.

37
00:01:34,422 --> 00:01:35,998
Class dismissed.

38
00:01:39,093 --> 00:01:43,496
Ah, I know that look.

39
00:01:43,498 --> 00:01:45,591
I felt the same after my 11:00 a.m.

40
00:01:45,594 --> 00:01:46,926
"Introduction to Fluid Mechanics

41
00:01:46,929 --> 00:01:49,735
and Physical Thermodynamics" class.

42
00:01:49,737 --> 00:01:52,305
See, I was trying to explain
the turbulent flow rates,

43
00:01:52,307 --> 00:01:54,774
and ten minutes in, I
wanted to pull my hair out.

44
00:01:54,776 --> 00:01:57,209
It's a good thing I know
water flowing to the axis

45
00:01:57,211 --> 00:01:59,052
of a tube is called...

46
00:01:59,055 --> 00:02:00,880
- You better get this right.
- Laminar?

47
00:02:00,882 --> 00:02:03,382
Ah, so you do listen.

48
00:02:03,384 --> 00:02:04,951
To you, always.

49
00:02:04,953 --> 00:02:07,053
Nothing matters to them
if it's not digestible

50
00:02:07,055 --> 00:02:12,862
in YouTube videos of talking
babies or inane pet tricks.

51
00:02:12,865 --> 00:02:16,562
Have you seen the husky
singing "Like a Virgin."

52
00:02:16,564 --> 00:02:19,732
I made you smile.

53
00:02:19,734 --> 00:02:22,768
How can we enlighten them
if their minds are too small

54
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:25,304
to handle the gift of knowledge anymore?

55
00:02:25,306 --> 00:02:26,939
Your plan will work.

56
00:02:26,941 --> 00:02:29,041
We just need to refashion
the delivery system.

57
00:02:29,043 --> 00:02:30,810
It's not the plan that's flawed,

58
00:02:30,813 --> 00:02:32,845
it's my ability to execute it.

59
00:02:32,847 --> 00:02:34,046
Clifford.

60
00:02:34,048 --> 00:02:35,581
I'm simply not smart enough.

61
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:38,050
You are the most brilliant mind I know.

62
00:02:38,052 --> 00:02:40,193
It's not enough.

63
00:02:40,196 --> 00:02:42,130
Not yet.

64
00:02:42,133 --> 00:02:44,068
When?

65
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:53,299
At this point, it's just a concept.

66
00:02:53,301 --> 00:02:55,368
I call this my thinking cap.

67
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:56,709
And just like their minds

68
00:02:56,712 --> 00:02:59,105
have gotten too small to
handle their full capacity,

69
00:02:59,107 --> 00:03:01,040
mine's too small to deliver it.

70
00:03:01,042 --> 00:03:03,609
This can change all that,

71
00:03:03,611 --> 00:03:08,080
if you build it, of course.

72
00:03:11,119 --> 00:03:14,754
Your dream is my dream.

73
00:03:14,756 --> 00:03:17,724
And your passion is my passion.

74
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,865
I'm nothing without you.

75
00:03:29,802 --> 00:03:33,072
I hope it's not too sweet.

76
00:03:33,074 --> 00:03:35,174
Mm!

77
00:03:35,176 --> 00:03:36,542
This is amazing.

78
00:03:36,544 --> 00:03:37,709
Just like my wife.

79
00:03:37,712 --> 00:03:39,711
Somehow she finds
time to take care of me

80
00:03:39,714 --> 00:03:41,647
and still keep an immaculate household.

81
00:03:41,649 --> 00:03:45,251
And her three-cheese
macaroni? Second to none!

82
00:03:45,253 --> 00:03:49,522
Sometimes I think I'm
the luckiest man alive.

83
00:03:49,524 --> 00:03:52,325
Gentlemen, how can I help?

84
00:03:52,327 --> 00:03:57,063
The name DeVoe came up in
an investigation of ours.

85
00:03:57,065 --> 00:03:59,732
We would just like to ask you
some questions, if that's okay.

86
00:03:59,735 --> 00:04:00,783
Why him?

87
00:04:00,786 --> 00:04:02,091
DeVoe's a common name.

88
00:04:02,094 --> 00:04:06,305
Yes, I'd wager at
least 1,100 individuals

89
00:04:06,307 --> 00:04:07,807
give or take a few with that last name

90
00:04:07,809 --> 00:04:09,108
in the Central City area alone.

91
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:10,349
The name's been identified

92
00:04:10,352 --> 00:04:13,078
for its connection to four
separate criminal cases.

93
00:04:13,081 --> 00:04:15,648
So you think my husband is
a witness to these crimes?

94
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:18,985
No, we'd like to
eliminate him as a suspect.

95
00:04:18,987 --> 00:04:20,553
You can't be serious.

96
00:04:20,555 --> 00:04:23,756
That's all right, Marlize. Do go ahead.

97
00:04:23,758 --> 00:04:26,859
So, Professor, what
brought you to Central City?

98
00:04:26,861 --> 00:04:30,463
I grew up in South Africa.
After studying history

99
00:04:30,465 --> 00:04:33,165
and econometrics at the
University of Johannesburg,

100
00:04:33,167 --> 00:04:35,134
I took a teaching position at Oxford.

101
00:04:35,136 --> 00:04:37,236
- That's where we met.
- Mmhmm.

102
00:04:37,238 --> 00:04:40,606
He swept me off my feet and we
have been together ever since.

103
00:04:40,608 --> 00:04:44,810
It did take a tenured offer
from Central City University

104
00:04:44,812 --> 00:04:46,712
to lure me away from the Oxford faculty.

105
00:04:46,714 --> 00:04:48,614
That was four years ago.

106
00:04:48,616 --> 00:04:52,834
Question: Do you know Ramsey Deacon?

107
00:04:55,456 --> 00:04:57,156
No, should I?

108
00:04:57,158 --> 00:05:00,593
What about Becky Sharpe?

109
00:05:00,595 --> 00:05:02,495
No, I'm afraid not.

110
00:05:02,497 --> 00:05:04,576
Ralph Dibny?

111
00:05:04,579 --> 00:05:06,115
Mina Chaytan?

112
00:05:06,118 --> 00:05:09,001
Mina Chaytan. Now, that name's familiar.

113
00:05:09,003 --> 00:05:10,870
Isn't this the Native American woman

114
00:05:10,872 --> 00:05:11,912
that left abruptly?

115
00:05:11,915 --> 00:05:13,938
- You know, the anthropologist?
- Yes, I remember.

116
00:05:13,941 --> 00:05:15,808
I was so sad to see her go.

117
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:17,710
You were colleagues.

118
00:05:17,712 --> 00:05:19,311
Did she mention her work?

119
00:05:19,313 --> 00:05:23,716
No, no, no. Mina was an animated woman.

120
00:05:23,718 --> 00:05:27,687
Then again, people like us
who see education as a calling,

121
00:05:27,689 --> 00:05:29,288
we often are.

122
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:32,638
That painting...

123
00:05:32,641 --> 00:05:35,494
Uh, it's beautiful.

124
00:05:35,496 --> 00:05:38,431
The samurai. They were formidable foes.

125
00:05:38,433 --> 00:05:42,034
They'd often make unstoppable
enemies to their opponents.

126
00:05:42,036 --> 00:05:45,571
You wouldn't want to cross one.

127
00:05:45,573 --> 00:05:48,140
So you spent time in Japan?

128
00:05:48,142 --> 00:05:50,242
The feudal history of medieval Japan

129
00:05:50,244 --> 00:05:52,044
is one of my areas of expertise.

130
00:05:52,046 --> 00:05:54,847
Then you must speak the language?

131
00:05:54,849 --> 00:05:57,917
Hai, watashi wa gakumon-kaide

132
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,752
shika shiyo shite imasen.

133
00:05:59,754 --> 00:06:02,955
He also speaks French,
Italian, Mandarin,

134
00:06:02,957 --> 00:06:04,388
and several other languages.

135
00:06:04,391 --> 00:06:05,658
Here's the thing, here's the thing.

136
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,359
I love teaching.

137
00:06:07,361 --> 00:06:09,962
It gives me the opportunity
to broaden perspectives.

138
00:06:09,964 --> 00:06:13,365
But you can't just inspire
people to be better.

139
00:06:13,367 --> 00:06:17,269
You somehow need to change
the way people think.

140
00:06:17,271 --> 00:06:20,940
Clifford! My husband is very passionate,

141
00:06:20,942 --> 00:06:22,942
but he also needs his rest.

142
00:06:22,944 --> 00:06:25,845
Is there anything
else we can do to help?

143
00:06:25,847 --> 00:06:28,013
No. Thank you.

144
00:06:28,015 --> 00:06:31,183
If we have any more questions,
we'll get in contact.

145
00:06:33,087 --> 00:06:35,521
- Barry.
- Yeah.

146
00:06:41,229 --> 00:06:42,795
You know where to find me.

147
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:56,841
Well?

148
00:06:56,844 --> 00:06:58,110
Is it him?

149
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:04,549
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -

150
00:07:06,187 --> 00:07:07,623
I don't know, Barry.

151
00:07:07,626 --> 00:07:10,054
This shy college professor
who likes mac 'n' cheese

152
00:07:10,057 --> 00:07:12,525
doesn't exactly seem like
a criminal mastermind to me.

153
00:07:12,527 --> 00:07:13,993
I mean, come on. It
wouldn't be the first time

154
00:07:13,995 --> 00:07:15,263
somebody played nice

155
00:07:15,266 --> 00:07:17,099
and then turned out to be our bad guy.

156
00:07:17,102 --> 00:07:19,297
The Council of Wells gave
us his name for a reason.

157
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,600
- He gave us one name out of...
- 1,100.

158
00:07:21,602 --> 00:07:23,435
1,122 to be precise.

159
00:07:23,437 --> 00:07:25,237
He was off by 22.

160
00:07:25,239 --> 00:07:27,306
I mean, isn't that a little suspicious?

161
00:07:27,308 --> 00:07:28,974
Not if he Googled himself.

162
00:07:28,976 --> 00:07:30,543
I'm just saying there's something weird

163
00:07:30,545 --> 00:07:32,311
about this guy. He likes samurai!

164
00:07:32,313 --> 00:07:33,412
Who doesn't?

165
00:07:33,414 --> 00:07:35,041
Have you seen "Zatoichi"...

166
00:07:35,044 --> 00:07:37,029
"The Blind Swordsman?"

167
00:07:37,032 --> 00:07:39,084
- Best Criterion Collection...
- Great box set.

168
00:07:39,086 --> 00:07:40,186
- Ever.
- Okay, guys.

169
00:07:40,188 --> 00:07:41,263
Think about this:

170
00:07:41,266 --> 00:07:42,951
If the Council's right, that means DeVoe

171
00:07:42,954 --> 00:07:44,621
arranged for me to come
out of the Speed Force

172
00:07:44,623 --> 00:07:46,519
exactly where he wanted.
Even you couldn't do that.

173
00:07:46,521 --> 00:07:47,660
You have a point.

174
00:07:47,662 --> 00:07:49,222
Okay, let's cover all our bases.

175
00:07:49,225 --> 00:07:50,147
Agreed.

176
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,890
Okay, Cisco, Harry, you
guys want to see what kind

177
00:07:51,892 --> 00:07:53,889
of digital footprint
you can get on this guy?

178
00:07:53,892 --> 00:07:55,761
Caitlin, you've got friends at CCU.

179
00:07:55,764 --> 00:07:57,243
Let's see what kind of person
we're dealing with.

180
00:07:57,245 --> 00:07:59,353
- Will do.
- Dad, CCPD background check?

181
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:01,555
On it, sweet one.

182
00:08:01,558 --> 00:08:05,476
And you. You all right?

183
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:07,279
Yeah, but thank you for asking.

184
00:08:07,281 --> 00:08:08,914
Mm-hmm.

185
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:12,051
Ooh, you know, I think
Human Resources might not be

186
00:08:12,053 --> 00:08:14,253
okay with this, us
being coworkers and all.

187
00:08:14,255 --> 00:08:16,288
Yeah, I think they'll let it slide,

188
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:19,087
considering I get to marry
the coworker of my dreams

189
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:20,984
a week from now.

190
00:08:20,987 --> 00:08:23,204
You know sometimes I feel like...

191
00:08:26,383 --> 00:08:27,587
Like what?

192
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,595
Like I'm the luckiest man alive.

193
00:08:33,941 --> 00:08:37,843
Nuclear physics, condensed
matter cosmology,

194
00:08:37,845 --> 00:08:40,412
even relativity, all these fields

195
00:08:40,414 --> 00:08:42,642
will be revolutionized overnight.

196
00:08:53,394 --> 00:08:56,695
You've infused my design with life.

197
00:08:56,697 --> 00:08:58,230
We still have a problem.

198
00:08:58,232 --> 00:09:00,466
There's currently no
way to power a prototype

199
00:09:00,468 --> 00:09:01,634
this sophisticated.

200
00:09:01,636 --> 00:09:03,369
We'll find a solution.

201
00:09:03,371 --> 00:09:05,604
Expanding the mind to an
infinite capacity requires

202
00:09:05,606 --> 00:09:07,473
an expanding energy source.

203
00:09:07,475 --> 00:09:11,010
Where are we going to
find that kind of power?

204
00:09:11,012 --> 00:09:12,978
- Can you tell us how?
- Turn that up.

205
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,813
It'll change the way
we think about science.

206
00:09:14,815 --> 00:09:16,048
About quantum mechanics,

207
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,783
about molecular physics.

208
00:09:17,785 --> 00:09:20,319
Once my particle accelerator goes online,

209
00:09:20,321 --> 00:09:24,056
it'll blow the doors of
science off their hinges.

210
00:09:24,058 --> 00:09:25,925
- That's amazing.
- Ah.

211
00:09:25,927 --> 00:09:29,376
We needed a power source
unlike anything imaginable.

212
00:09:30,868 --> 00:09:35,901
Well, it seems Harrison
Wells just imagined it for us.

213
00:09:35,903 --> 00:09:38,971
Instantly change lives.

214
00:09:41,809 --> 00:09:45,044
History moves in cycles.

215
00:09:45,046 --> 00:09:48,392
We must therefore learn
from what came before us

216
00:09:48,395 --> 00:09:50,449
in order to carve a path

217
00:09:50,451 --> 00:09:51,743
for what's to come.

218
00:09:51,746 --> 00:09:54,126
Because those who don't learn from...

219
00:09:58,693 --> 00:10:01,026
Because those who
don't learn from history

220
00:10:01,028 --> 00:10:03,128
are doomed to repeat it.

221
00:10:05,299 --> 00:10:06,799
Class dismissed.

222
00:10:06,801 --> 00:10:08,600
Don't forget your reading material!

223
00:10:08,602 --> 00:10:11,603
Chapter 11 on the
counterculture backlash

224
00:10:11,605 --> 00:10:14,821
and its influence on the
Reagan administration.

225
00:10:17,378 --> 00:10:19,044
Mr. Allen.

226
00:10:19,046 --> 00:10:20,579
Twice in one day.

227
00:10:20,581 --> 00:10:22,314
Yeah, sorry to bother you again.

228
00:10:22,316 --> 00:10:25,651
Look, I do have a stack
of midterm exams...

229
00:10:25,653 --> 00:10:27,286
Yeah, no, I understand you're busy.

230
00:10:27,288 --> 00:10:31,357
This won't take long.
I just wanted to ask,

231
00:10:31,359 --> 00:10:33,158
where were you four years ago

232
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,928
on the night of January 7th?

233
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:39,565
Honestly, Mr. Allen, I have no idea.

234
00:10:39,567 --> 00:10:42,534
How far back does this
investigation of yours go?

235
00:10:42,536 --> 00:10:45,485
I'm not at liberty to
discuss that with you.

236
00:10:45,488 --> 00:10:48,874
Also, um, do you ever
use public transit?

237
00:10:50,411 --> 00:10:52,177
What? Like the subway?

238
00:10:52,179 --> 00:10:53,712
I mean imagine me in a wheelchair...

239
00:10:53,714 --> 00:10:55,047
More like a bus.

240
00:10:56,884 --> 00:10:58,784
Is this really necessary?

241
00:10:58,786 --> 00:11:02,621
I'm just being thorough.

242
00:11:02,623 --> 00:11:04,923
Fine. I prefer Lyft.

243
00:11:04,925 --> 00:11:07,693
They're wheelchair friendly.

244
00:11:07,695 --> 00:11:10,562
Honestly, Mr. Allen, how are
my vehicle options important

245
00:11:10,564 --> 00:11:12,664
or a date I can hardly remember?

246
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:14,466
I'm just trying to establish a timeline,

247
00:11:14,468 --> 00:11:15,571
solve a mystery.

248
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:18,403
Mysteries are for
novelists and archeologists.

249
00:11:18,406 --> 00:11:21,974
You were supposed to be
ruling me out as a suspect.

250
00:11:21,976 --> 00:11:24,643
Instead it seems like
you've got your guy.

251
00:11:24,645 --> 00:11:27,780
Oh, no. This is just procedure.

252
00:11:27,782 --> 00:11:30,149
Feels like persecution.

253
00:11:30,151 --> 00:11:32,718
Now, can I get back to you,

254
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,548
or do I need to accompany you downtown?

255
00:11:36,551 --> 00:11:39,418
No, of course not.

256
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,761
Just e-mail me.

257
00:11:47,764 --> 00:11:49,664
And again, I'm sorry to bother you.

258
00:12:09,392 --> 00:12:12,430
So this is an example of meta-DNA.

259
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:15,017
This is the DNA you
brought me from DeVoe.

260
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,768
It's completely normal.

261
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:20,431
Do you see all the differences?

262
00:12:20,434 --> 00:12:23,541
Clifford DeVoe is not a meta.

263
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:25,443
Did you two find anything?

264
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:28,079
Well, he's never been arrested,

265
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:30,582
he pays all his taxes and his mortgage.

266
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:32,394
He has a very reasonable 401k plan.

267
00:12:32,397 --> 00:12:33,896
Donates to the Sierra Club,

268
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:37,067
volunteers at an
orphanage as a big brother.

269
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:38,803
Dad didn't find anything either.

270
00:12:38,806 --> 00:12:41,691
Says that he's an upstanding
member of the community.

271
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:43,452
Yeah, I talked to
some friends at Oxford.

272
00:12:43,454 --> 00:12:45,320
They said DeVoe's a little absentminded,

273
00:12:45,322 --> 00:12:46,488
but everybody likes him.

274
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:47,426
Guys, I'm telling you.

275
00:12:47,429 --> 00:12:49,857
Clifford DeVoe is not what he seems.

276
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,894
That could just be the wheelchair.

277
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,428
- I mean...
- No.

278
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:54,963
You do kind of have a bad history.

279
00:12:54,965 --> 00:12:55,809
That wasn't me.

280
00:12:55,812 --> 00:12:57,832
Come on. He's just too perfect.

281
00:12:57,835 --> 00:13:00,002
Okay? I just... I have a strong feeling

282
00:13:00,004 --> 00:13:01,637
that he's hiding something.

283
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:03,051
You don't believe me.

284
00:13:03,054 --> 00:13:05,019
No, it's not that we
don't believe you, Barry.

285
00:13:05,022 --> 00:13:09,310
It's just, right now DeVoe
seems like a good guy.

286
00:13:09,313 --> 00:13:10,980
Guys, it's him.

287
00:13:10,983 --> 00:13:14,383
I thought we were done just
assuming people are villains.

288
00:13:14,385 --> 00:13:15,793
All right, you know what?

289
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:17,186
Vibe it.

290
00:13:37,512 --> 00:13:39,457
Mm.

291
00:13:45,549 --> 00:13:47,649
Oh, my God.

292
00:13:47,651 --> 00:13:49,184
You were right.

293
00:13:49,186 --> 00:13:51,820
That mac 'n' cheese looks unbelievable.

294
00:13:51,822 --> 00:13:54,223
See? That doesn't sound
very villainous, does it?

295
00:13:54,225 --> 00:13:56,959
Barry, can I talk to you outside?

296
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:58,861
Mm-hmm.

297
00:13:58,863 --> 00:14:02,164
Okay, so do you want to tell
me what's really bothering you?

298
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:04,700
My Spidey sense is just
tingling way off the charts.

299
00:14:04,702 --> 00:14:06,068
But, Barry, is there
any chance that this

300
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:06,980
is about the wedding?

301
00:14:06,983 --> 00:14:08,177
I mean maybe you're feeling a little...

302
00:14:08,179 --> 00:14:09,332
No, I'm not nervous.

303
00:14:09,335 --> 00:14:11,527
But you're not acting the
way that you normally do.

304
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:14,079
Look, Savitar and Kadabra warned us

305
00:14:14,082 --> 00:14:15,677
about someone named DeVoe.

306
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:18,447
This DeVoe guy could
be behind everything.

307
00:14:18,449 --> 00:14:19,590
The bus metas,

308
00:14:19,593 --> 00:14:21,722
me coming out of the Speed
Force at the wrong place,

309
00:14:21,725 --> 00:14:22,965
the Samuroid!

310
00:14:22,968 --> 00:14:25,720
Barry, is there a possibility
that you were so determined

311
00:14:25,723 --> 00:14:27,356
to find the bad guy and
get ahead of everything

312
00:14:27,358 --> 00:14:28,690
that you're seeing
things exactly the way

313
00:14:28,692 --> 00:14:29,725
you want to see them?

314
00:14:29,727 --> 00:14:32,494
No. I...

315
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:35,731
Maybe, I don't...

316
00:14:35,733 --> 00:14:37,833
Look, in seven days

317
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:40,168
I am going to marry the man that I love.

318
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,571
But right now I have
to lock down a new DJ

319
00:14:42,573 --> 00:14:44,539
because the last one got
fired for drinking too much

320
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:46,608
and wouldn't stop dancing
with the father of the bride.

321
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:48,377
Joe might be into that, actually.

322
00:14:48,379 --> 00:14:50,479
Which is exactly why I need to go home.

323
00:14:50,481 --> 00:14:53,248
And I would really like your help.

324
00:15:01,659 --> 00:15:03,492
Ready for the press conference?

325
00:15:03,494 --> 00:15:06,595
Absolutely.

326
00:15:12,403 --> 00:15:15,470
Thank you. My name is Harrison Wells.

327
00:15:15,472 --> 00:15:18,607
Tonight, the future begins.

328
00:15:18,609 --> 00:15:21,743
The work my team and I will do here

329
00:15:21,745 --> 00:15:24,346
will change our
understanding of physics,

330
00:15:24,348 --> 00:15:26,621
will bring about advancements in power,

331
00:15:26,624 --> 00:15:28,090
advancements in medicine.

332
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,284
It'll bring about advancements, period.

333
00:15:30,287 --> 00:15:32,487
This is the future.

334
00:15:32,489 --> 00:15:33,989
And trust me,

335
00:15:33,991 --> 00:15:35,924
it'll be here faster than you think.

336
00:15:37,761 --> 00:15:38,926
What does it mean to you?

337
00:15:38,929 --> 00:15:40,462
This new endeavor of ours...

338
00:15:40,465 --> 00:15:42,530
Hey, my laptop! It's
got my dissertation!

339
00:15:42,533 --> 00:15:45,137
For the citizens of Central City.

340
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,168
Well, it would appear
tonight's entertainment

341
00:15:47,171 --> 00:15:49,348
is not limited to the stage.

342
00:15:49,351 --> 00:15:50,808
What's the first thing you'll do

343
00:15:50,811 --> 00:15:52,578
once the accelerator is online?

344
00:15:52,581 --> 00:15:54,681
Is crack open an expensive
bottle of Dom Perignon

345
00:15:54,684 --> 00:15:56,544
with my staff, because
I ride them very hard

346
00:15:56,547 --> 00:15:57,980
and they've earned it. Yes?

347
00:15:57,982 --> 00:15:59,815
Those protesting this accelerator

348
00:15:59,817 --> 00:16:02,951
believe it could open a
black hole in Central City.

349
00:16:02,953 --> 00:16:06,455
But is it not more likely to
cause a benevolent phenomenon

350
00:16:06,457 --> 00:16:08,590
like a Higgs boson bridge?

351
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:11,560
The only phenomenon that
will occur this evening

352
00:16:11,562 --> 00:16:14,096
is one that has been calculated
to the tiniest detail,

353
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,531
to the tiniest decimal point.

354
00:16:16,533 --> 00:16:19,868
So you've foreseen
every possible outcome?

355
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,937
Yes, I have, Miss...?

356
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,769
Mrs. Marlize DeVoe.

357
00:16:26,143 --> 00:16:28,535
DeVoe.

358
00:16:28,597 --> 00:16:30,130
DeVoe.

359
00:16:30,133 --> 00:16:31,680
I expect that would make the gentleman

360
00:16:31,682 --> 00:16:35,384
to your right your husband?

361
00:16:35,386 --> 00:16:38,787
Clifford DeVoe.

362
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:41,156
I'm a big fan of your work.

363
00:16:41,158 --> 00:16:43,992
Sir, I believe it will
have an enormous impact

364
00:16:43,994 --> 00:16:48,030
on our future. Thank you
for coming, Professor.

365
00:16:48,032 --> 00:16:50,032
Good luck.

366
00:16:53,871 --> 00:16:55,402
Shut it down!

367
00:16:55,405 --> 00:16:59,775
Wells is lying. He knows the
accelerator won't succeed.

368
00:16:59,777 --> 00:17:02,711
- He'd risk an explosion?
- No, I think he wants one,

369
00:17:02,713 --> 00:17:04,946
only the fallout from
dark matter being released

370
00:17:04,948 --> 00:17:06,648
into the atmosphere
will produce variants

371
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:07,849
we cannot yet predict.

372
00:17:07,851 --> 00:17:09,351
We need to delay our plan.

373
00:17:09,353 --> 00:17:10,685
No, this is even better.

374
00:17:10,687 --> 00:17:12,285
We'll have all the power we need.

375
00:17:12,288 --> 00:17:14,255
No! It's too risky.

376
00:17:14,258 --> 00:17:16,358
I'm willing to take the chance.

377
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,760
The blast is the only thing
that can power the cap.

378
00:17:18,762 --> 00:17:22,531
We should wait. Try
and find another way.

379
00:17:22,533 --> 00:17:24,132
This is the only way.

380
00:17:26,236 --> 00:17:30,605
Shut it down! Shut it down!

381
00:17:30,707 --> 00:17:33,942
Shut it down! Shut it down!

382
00:17:33,944 --> 00:17:35,544
Shut it down!

383
00:17:40,073 --> 00:17:41,324
Ready, my love?

384
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:43,860
In position!

385
00:17:59,303 --> 00:18:01,340
It's starting!

386
00:18:25,885 --> 00:18:27,350
What's happening?

387
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:35,971
Clifford!

388
00:18:44,515 --> 00:18:45,855
Clifford!

389
00:18:47,317 --> 00:18:50,252
Clifford!

390
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:51,920
No!

391
00:18:56,093 --> 00:19:02,063
Clifford, no! No! No!

392
00:19:02,065 --> 00:19:04,199
Don't you dare leave me!

393
00:19:24,155 --> 00:19:25,980
I thought I'd lost you.

394
00:19:28,926 --> 00:19:31,074
How do you feel?

395
00:19:32,996 --> 00:19:36,264
Enlightened.

396
00:19:45,509 --> 00:19:47,842
- Hey, Allen!
- Hmm?

397
00:19:47,844 --> 00:19:49,711
- Singh wants to see you.
- One second.

398
00:19:49,713 --> 00:19:52,414
I don't know, Allen. Singh's
making that face again.

399
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:53,715
You might want to hurry.

400
00:19:56,453 --> 00:19:59,087
Trust me, I understand. Mr. Allen!

401
00:19:59,089 --> 00:20:01,022
What's this?

402
00:20:01,024 --> 00:20:05,026
- Close the door, please.
- Yeah.

403
00:20:05,028 --> 00:20:06,394
Continue, Professor.

404
00:20:06,396 --> 00:20:09,931
First my home, then my classroom.

405
00:20:09,933 --> 00:20:13,777
What's next? Our bedroom where we sleep?

406
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,160
Joe and I just went...

407
00:20:15,163 --> 00:20:17,638
On behalf of the Central
City Police Department,

408
00:20:17,641 --> 00:20:19,708
I'd like to extend
our sincerest apologies

409
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:22,477
for this intrusion.

410
00:20:22,479 --> 00:20:24,215
Mr. Allen?

411
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:29,384
Um, yeah. I'm sorry for
disturbing you, Mr. DeVoe.

412
00:20:29,386 --> 00:20:31,753
Professor DeVoe.

413
00:20:31,755 --> 00:20:32,954
Thank you for coming in.

414
00:20:41,164 --> 00:20:42,864
What the hell were they doing here?

415
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:45,033
They just filed a complaint against you.

416
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,268
Said you harassed them.

417
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,702
No, I wasn't harassing them.

418
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:49,237
Why are you bothering them at all?

419
00:20:49,239 --> 00:20:51,105
- I...
- It's a case we're working on.

420
00:20:51,108 --> 00:20:52,207
What case?

421
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,543
It's something that...

422
00:20:53,546 --> 00:20:54,855
Do me a favor.

423
00:20:54,858 --> 00:20:56,848
Stay away from the nice
professor and his wife.

424
00:20:56,851 --> 00:21:00,749
- Captain, DeVoe seems very...
- Very what?

425
00:21:00,751 --> 00:21:04,152
And unless the answer is
guilty of a very specific crime,

426
00:21:04,154 --> 00:21:06,388
you are way off base.

427
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:09,924
So are you, Joe. You should
know better than that.

428
00:21:09,926 --> 00:21:11,526
You don't show up at someone's house

429
00:21:11,528 --> 00:21:12,927
and start asking questions.

430
00:21:12,929 --> 00:21:14,763
You follow protocol.

431
00:21:14,765 --> 00:21:16,498
Yes, sir.

432
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:32,526
Anybody home?

433
00:21:32,528 --> 00:21:33,694
Whoa!

434
00:21:35,498 --> 00:21:36,780
Hey!

435
00:21:36,783 --> 00:21:39,800
Hi. Dad said you were having a bad day.

436
00:21:39,802 --> 00:21:40,905
What? No, I'm fine.

437
00:21:40,908 --> 00:21:43,142
I'm great, actually. How are you doing?

438
00:21:45,942 --> 00:21:47,975
What?

439
00:21:47,977 --> 00:21:49,710
What are you...

440
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,953
What is this?

441
00:21:58,955 --> 00:22:02,890
His wife, Iris, she's helping him.

442
00:22:02,892 --> 00:22:04,273
No, listen! Okay, look:

443
00:22:04,276 --> 00:22:07,694
She's not Suzy Homemaker with
her perfect mac 'n' cheese.

444
00:22:07,697 --> 00:22:09,029
She is a Stepford wife.

445
00:22:09,031 --> 00:22:10,564
She's got two doctorates, you know?

446
00:22:10,566 --> 00:22:11,966
One in mechanical engineering

447
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:13,667
and another in advanced robotics.

448
00:22:13,669 --> 00:22:14,827
That's how they work!

449
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:17,071
He comes up with the plans,
but she executes them.

450
00:22:17,073 --> 00:22:19,173
She's some kind of mechanical genius.

451
00:22:19,175 --> 00:22:21,775
So you think that DeVoe and
his wife are supervillains?

452
00:22:21,777 --> 00:22:23,711
- Yes.
- Listen to yourself, Barry.

453
00:22:23,713 --> 00:22:24,687
What?

454
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:26,980
DeVoe has already filed
a complaint against you!

455
00:22:26,983 --> 00:22:28,415
I know, I...

456
00:22:28,417 --> 00:22:32,987
Look, Cisco, Harry, my dad, Caitlin,

457
00:22:32,989 --> 00:22:36,957
they are the best, and they
have found nothing on DeVoe.

458
00:22:36,959 --> 00:22:40,694
We are getting married in a week, Barry.

459
00:22:40,696 --> 00:22:42,863
Please,

460
00:22:42,865 --> 00:22:45,032
for the sake of your job and my sanity,

461
00:22:45,034 --> 00:22:47,882
please let it go.

462
00:23:01,901 --> 00:23:04,384
I've solved them.

463
00:23:04,387 --> 00:23:05,853
Solved what?

464
00:23:05,855 --> 00:23:07,855
Riemann's hypothesis,

465
00:23:07,857 --> 00:23:10,057
Hilbert's 15th problem,

466
00:23:10,059 --> 00:23:12,760
standard conjectures
on algebraic cycles,

467
00:23:12,762 --> 00:23:15,229
and the list goes on.

468
00:23:15,231 --> 00:23:18,365
Clifford, this... This is incredible!

469
00:23:18,367 --> 00:23:19,999
Ask me anything!

470
00:23:20,002 --> 00:23:22,736
Um, who was Jack the Ripper?

471
00:23:22,738 --> 00:23:25,105
The prevailing theory is
there was a London barber

472
00:23:25,107 --> 00:23:27,574
by the name Aaron Kosminski
who committed the crimes.

473
00:23:27,576 --> 00:23:32,246
He also suffered schizophrenic
and delusional tendencies.

474
00:23:32,248 --> 00:23:37,718
But it was his nurse at
the Colney Hatch Asylum!

475
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,887
Catharine Jewell!

476
00:23:39,889 --> 00:23:42,156
It's like every little bit of knowledge

477
00:23:42,158 --> 00:23:43,891
now resides inside my brain.

478
00:23:43,893 --> 00:23:46,108
I know every answer to
every question ever asked.

479
00:23:46,111 --> 00:23:47,991
You're incredible!

480
00:23:47,994 --> 00:23:50,998
We're incredible! You
made all of this possible!

481
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,702
We now finally have the means
to bring to the world the...

482
00:23:54,704 --> 00:23:56,937
Clifford, are you okay?

483
00:23:56,939 --> 00:24:00,351
Clifford! Clifford!

484
00:24:00,354 --> 00:24:02,087
Clifford!

485
00:25:49,237 --> 00:25:51,026
What are you hiding, DeVoe?

486
00:26:27,356 --> 00:26:30,090
Imagine your body as a river.

487
00:26:30,092 --> 00:26:32,058
There's a dam blocking your legs.

488
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:35,929
My gastrocnemius muscles are
degenerating, aren't they?

489
00:26:35,931 --> 00:26:37,764
Well, yes.

490
00:26:37,766 --> 00:26:39,165
The symptoms are similar to...

491
00:26:39,167 --> 00:26:41,835
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

492
00:26:41,837 --> 00:26:43,870
But your muscles are decaying faster

493
00:26:43,872 --> 00:26:46,439
and more rapidly than typical ALS.

494
00:26:46,441 --> 00:26:49,409
I believe this is something else.

495
00:26:49,411 --> 00:26:50,911
Is that your medical diagnosis?

496
00:26:50,913 --> 00:26:52,659
That I have a case of something else?

497
00:26:52,662 --> 00:26:54,742
It's just we've never
seen a case like... oh...

498
00:26:54,745 --> 00:26:56,104
Yours before.

499
00:27:00,241 --> 00:27:02,655
An increase in complex
fasciculation potential

500
00:27:02,658 --> 00:27:04,917
explains axonal membrane
hyperexcitability.

501
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:08,088
But it doesn't...

502
00:27:08,091 --> 00:27:09,828
Of course.

503
00:27:09,831 --> 00:27:12,265
When gamma wave activity
exceeds 50 hertz,

504
00:27:12,267 --> 00:27:14,034
my acetylcholine receptors draw away

505
00:27:14,036 --> 00:27:16,336
from my nerve receptors

506
00:27:16,338 --> 00:27:18,271
instead of toward them.

507
00:27:18,273 --> 00:27:20,473
What did you say you're a professor of?

508
00:27:20,475 --> 00:27:23,410
History.

509
00:27:23,412 --> 00:27:25,445
What's his prognosis?

510
00:27:25,447 --> 00:27:28,237
Life expectancy for typical ALS

511
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,518
is about two to five years.

512
00:27:29,521 --> 00:27:33,003
In this chronodispersion,
it would be half that.

513
00:27:33,006 --> 00:27:36,323
Complete paralysis will come first.

514
00:27:36,325 --> 00:27:37,991
Excuse us, please.

515
00:27:43,665 --> 00:27:45,065
This doesn't make sense.

516
00:27:45,067 --> 00:27:48,468
My mind is drawing energy from my body,

517
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:52,505
like a parasite feeding
on an ailing host.

518
00:27:52,507 --> 00:27:55,842
We're so close to everything
we've ever dreamed of,

519
00:27:55,844 --> 00:27:58,278
only for it to be
ripped away by this body.

520
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,880
No, no, no.

521
00:28:00,882 --> 00:28:05,352
We can stop this, Clifford.
I'll never give up.

522
00:28:05,354 --> 00:28:07,988
2,600 individuals
developed the meta-gene.

523
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:11,524
They use it to rob jewelry
stores and summon tornadoes.

524
00:28:11,526 --> 00:28:14,728
I use mine to save
humanity, and I'm condemned?

525
00:28:16,631 --> 00:28:19,065
- Dying wasn't part of our plan.
- Shh!

526
00:28:25,273 --> 00:28:28,245
Guys, I found a camera
in the Samuroid head.

527
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:29,507
Where did it lead back to?

528
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:31,711
- Where do you think?
- DeVoe!

529
00:28:31,713 --> 00:28:34,714
So you pinged the camera to
his computer's IP address?

530
00:28:34,716 --> 00:28:36,362
- Good!
- Well, no, I...

531
00:28:36,365 --> 00:28:37,965
I didn't ping it.

532
00:28:37,968 --> 00:28:39,898
Well then, how'd you
figure out it was him?

533
00:28:39,901 --> 00:28:41,768
- Well...
- This camera isn't even active.

534
00:28:41,771 --> 00:28:43,328
No, I heard it. It was making a noise.

535
00:28:43,331 --> 00:28:44,604
- A noise?
- Yeah.

536
00:28:44,607 --> 00:28:47,426
Inside the Samuroid
head, it was buzzing,

537
00:28:47,429 --> 00:28:48,895
and then I found that thing inside!

538
00:28:48,897 --> 00:28:50,542
He's been watching us for weeks,

539
00:28:50,545 --> 00:28:53,975
and I could've proved it, but
his wife came back too soon.

540
00:28:53,978 --> 00:28:57,070
- Too soon? From where?
- I don't...

541
00:28:57,072 --> 00:29:00,974
Barry, tell me you did
not break into their house.

542
00:29:00,976 --> 00:29:03,743
- Well...
- Wow. Okay.

543
00:29:03,745 --> 00:29:05,222
- Ugh.
- Okay, guys, that sounds bad,

544
00:29:05,225 --> 00:29:06,683
you have to listen to me,

545
00:29:06,686 --> 00:29:09,365
this guy wants us to think
he's unassuming and weak,

546
00:29:09,368 --> 00:29:11,917
but he's not, he is powerful and smart.

547
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,512
And he's been ahead of
us every step of the way.

548
00:29:13,514 --> 00:29:16,055
- He's ahead of us right now.
- Easy, Allen. Calm down.

549
00:29:16,058 --> 00:29:17,339
- I'm fine. I'm fine.
- Okay.

550
00:29:17,342 --> 00:29:18,871
Hey, hey, we just don't want you to do

551
00:29:18,874 --> 00:29:19,940
anything else you regret.

552
00:29:19,943 --> 00:29:21,574
Anything else? What do
you mean? What have I done?

553
00:29:21,576 --> 00:29:23,518
For starters, breaking and entering.

554
00:29:23,521 --> 00:29:25,097
Oh my God, I don't understand

555
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,566
why you don't see what's going on!

556
00:29:26,568 --> 00:29:28,401
He probably has cameras everywhere.

557
00:29:28,403 --> 00:29:31,492
At the lab, at CCPD, I mean
he's always watching us!

558
00:29:33,108 --> 00:29:35,175
Hey, Joe. What is it?

559
00:29:37,813 --> 00:29:40,146
- Hey, I found something.
- You better stop.

560
00:29:40,148 --> 00:29:43,283
I just don't feel
safe anymore, you know?

561
00:29:43,285 --> 00:29:44,984
I mean I thought the
police were supposed

562
00:29:44,986 --> 00:29:47,956
to protect people.

563
00:29:47,959 --> 00:29:49,758
I haven't done anything to you.

564
00:29:49,761 --> 00:29:53,496
You broke into our home!

565
00:29:56,833 --> 00:29:59,866
We're good people.
We don't deserve this.

566
00:29:59,868 --> 00:30:01,668
Okay. I don't want you to worry anymore.

567
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:04,304
Mr. Allen will stop
all of this immediately.

568
00:30:04,306 --> 00:30:06,606
I assure you.

569
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:15,964
Stay away from us.

570
00:30:21,523 --> 00:30:23,256
I told you to stay
away from those people!

571
00:30:23,258 --> 00:30:24,643
Captain, you have to listen to me.

572
00:30:24,646 --> 00:30:26,659
You're taking two weeks off,
and that is not a request.

573
00:30:26,661 --> 00:30:28,128
You're suspending me?

574
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:30,196
You're lucky I'm not arresting you.

575
00:30:33,101 --> 00:30:35,835
Use your time away to consider
your future in law enforcement.

576
00:30:51,944 --> 00:30:53,043
What is this?

577
00:30:53,045 --> 00:30:55,179
A restraining order.

578
00:30:55,181 --> 00:30:58,215
I have to stay 500 feet
away from Clifford DeVoe.

579
00:30:58,217 --> 00:30:59,750
And are you going to?

580
00:31:02,621 --> 00:31:05,189
Barry,

581
00:31:05,191 --> 00:31:08,525
this is not you. You've got to stop.

582
00:31:08,527 --> 00:31:10,394
- I can't.
- You can't or you won't?

583
00:31:10,396 --> 00:31:12,796
I don't know anymore.

584
00:31:12,798 --> 00:31:14,998
I've faced a lot of bad guys,

585
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,668
people that would hurt
the ones that I love,

586
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:20,637
destroy everything good in the
world, and think nothing of it,

587
00:31:20,639 --> 00:31:23,774
but this guy, he feels more dangerous

588
00:31:23,776 --> 00:31:25,442
than all the others combined.

589
00:31:25,444 --> 00:31:28,045
And we still barely
know anything about him.

590
00:31:28,047 --> 00:31:30,013
It scares the hell out of me, Iris.

591
00:31:30,015 --> 00:31:32,649
Barry, how many times have we
been up against the unknown?

592
00:31:32,651 --> 00:31:34,742
- This is different.
- How?

593
00:31:39,124 --> 00:31:41,425
Ever since I came back
from the Speed Force,

594
00:31:41,427 --> 00:31:46,830
I have been constantly
and genuinely happy.

595
00:31:46,832 --> 00:31:48,932
My friends are safe.

596
00:31:48,934 --> 00:31:51,735
Joe's gonna be a dad again.

597
00:31:51,737 --> 00:31:56,540
And next week, I get to
marry the love of my life.

598
00:31:56,542 --> 00:31:59,718
I have more to lose
now than ever before.

599
00:32:02,114 --> 00:32:07,517
Yeah, but what about
after Cecile has the baby?

600
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:09,119
Or after we get married,

601
00:32:09,121 --> 00:32:14,391
or even when we have our first child?

602
00:32:14,393 --> 00:32:17,195
You know as time goes by,
there's gonna be even more

603
00:32:17,198 --> 00:32:18,734
for us to lose.

604
00:32:18,737 --> 00:32:21,765
And people are always
going to be coming after us.

605
00:32:21,767 --> 00:32:23,734
You can't let that consume you,

606
00:32:23,736 --> 00:32:27,871
you just have to live in the
moment and face it as it comes.

607
00:32:27,873 --> 00:32:30,086
How are you not scared?

608
00:32:35,814 --> 00:32:38,078
Because we're the Flash.

609
00:33:07,351 --> 00:33:09,664
Clifford? Clifford.

610
00:33:09,667 --> 00:33:11,600
Clifford. Clifford!

611
00:33:11,603 --> 00:33:13,537
Get away from me!

612
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,976
I'm trying to help you.

613
00:33:15,979 --> 00:33:17,542
If you really wish to help,

614
00:33:17,545 --> 00:33:20,056
construct a temporal
vortex distortion chamber

615
00:33:20,059 --> 00:33:23,060
and prevent me from ever
becoming this atrocity!

616
00:33:23,062 --> 00:33:24,249
This is what we wanted.

617
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:27,798
Because I cannot grab a
damn book from this shelf!

618
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:43,513
What am I, Marlize?

619
00:33:43,515 --> 00:33:46,687
You are my husband!

620
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:48,855
Your husband is gone.

621
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,724
Let me die.

622
00:34:16,982 --> 00:34:19,062
I'm not going anywhere.

623
00:34:19,065 --> 00:34:21,077
This body will expire.

624
00:34:26,591 --> 00:34:30,393
It will last longer with this.

625
00:34:47,746 --> 00:34:52,115
You are in violation of your
restraining order, Mr. Allen.

626
00:34:52,117 --> 00:34:56,253
Well, you can call the cops.

627
00:34:56,255 --> 00:34:59,322
Do you intend to harm me?

628
00:34:59,324 --> 00:35:02,192
Then pray do tell what is so paramount

629
00:35:02,194 --> 00:35:04,394
that you'd risk incarceration?

630
00:35:04,396 --> 00:35:07,164
I wanted to look you
in the eyes and ask...

631
00:35:07,166 --> 00:35:09,766
Mm-hmm?

632
00:35:09,768 --> 00:35:11,902
Who are you really?

633
00:35:26,819 --> 00:35:29,519
Who's asking?

634
00:35:29,521 --> 00:35:31,555
Barry Allen?

635
00:35:34,193 --> 00:35:36,259
Or the Flash?

636
00:35:36,261 --> 00:35:39,529
- How did you...
- Oh, please.

637
00:35:39,531 --> 00:35:40,931
Your little secret is one of

638
00:35:40,933 --> 00:35:42,833
the more underwhelming revelations

639
00:35:42,835 --> 00:35:44,801
I have uncovered.

640
00:35:44,803 --> 00:35:47,437
I was born on the same evening you were.

641
00:35:47,439 --> 00:35:51,741
January 7th, the night S.T.A.R.
Labs' particle accelerator

642
00:35:51,743 --> 00:35:55,245
bathed Central City in
gene-altering dark matter.

643
00:35:55,247 --> 00:35:57,614
We were both struck by lightning.

644
00:35:57,616 --> 00:36:00,283
I knew you were affected.

645
00:36:00,285 --> 00:36:02,486
How did our test not
show your meta-DNA?

646
00:36:02,488 --> 00:36:04,955
For such a fast man, you're rather slow.

647
00:36:04,957 --> 00:36:06,122
I'm smarter than you.

648
00:36:07,471 --> 00:36:11,663
You and your science team
have devised no strategy,

649
00:36:11,666 --> 00:36:14,430
no action, no coordinated effort

650
00:36:14,433 --> 00:36:16,867
for which I'm not already prepared.

651
00:36:16,869 --> 00:36:21,104
The Samuroid, the bus metas.

652
00:36:21,106 --> 00:36:23,106
It was you.

653
00:36:23,108 --> 00:36:25,375
But why reveal yourself now?

654
00:36:25,377 --> 00:36:28,211
Because I have nothing to fear from you.

655
00:36:28,213 --> 00:36:31,581
Yeah? Well, I'd think twice about that.

656
00:36:31,583 --> 00:36:34,251
I have a team of some
of the smartest minds

657
00:36:34,253 --> 00:36:35,452
from across the multiverse.

658
00:36:35,454 --> 00:36:39,456
Yes, your Council of Wells.

659
00:36:39,458 --> 00:36:41,091
Could any one of those clowns

660
00:36:41,093 --> 00:36:44,961
identify what my abilities are?

661
00:36:44,963 --> 00:36:48,031
You could gather every
genius on every planet,

662
00:36:48,033 --> 00:36:51,401
and you still couldn't outthink me.

663
00:36:51,403 --> 00:36:54,170
Plenty of metas have come after me,

664
00:36:54,172 --> 00:36:55,772
the people that I love.

665
00:36:55,774 --> 00:36:58,608
You know the one thing
they have in common?

666
00:36:58,610 --> 00:37:00,076
They failed.

667
00:37:00,078 --> 00:37:02,379
You've done wonders all these years

668
00:37:02,381 --> 00:37:05,048
punching gorillas with
rudimentary powers,

669
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:07,517
chasing madmen shooting icicles.

670
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:10,153
Those were children with play guns.

671
00:37:10,155 --> 00:37:13,757
Savitar, Zoom, Thawne.

672
00:37:13,759 --> 00:37:16,927
Their powers are nothing
compared to the power

673
00:37:16,929 --> 00:37:20,497
of limitless thought.

674
00:37:20,499 --> 00:37:22,699
That's your ability?

675
00:37:22,701 --> 00:37:26,002
Your intellect was amplified
by the particle accelerator.

676
00:37:26,004 --> 00:37:29,039
You may be the fastest man alive, Allen.

677
00:37:29,041 --> 00:37:31,441
I'm the fastest mind.

678
00:37:36,982 --> 00:37:39,549
So this is how we begin
whatever twisted game

679
00:37:39,551 --> 00:37:41,335
you have planned.

680
00:37:43,422 --> 00:37:45,515
No, Mr. Allen. You've already lost,

681
00:37:45,518 --> 00:37:49,286
and you never even realized it.

682
00:37:49,289 --> 00:37:54,126
Congratulations on
your upcoming nuptials.

683
00:37:54,129 --> 00:37:55,762
I'll be thinking of you.

684
00:38:02,007 --> 00:38:03,711
There's something I need to tell you.

685
00:38:03,714 --> 00:38:05,132
I confronted DeVoe.

686
00:38:05,135 --> 00:38:07,347
Oh, come on, Barry. He
could get you arrested!

687
00:38:07,349 --> 00:38:08,782
No, he won't. He wanted me to come.

688
00:38:08,784 --> 00:38:09,875
How do you know?

689
00:38:09,878 --> 00:38:11,751
Well, for starters,
he knows I'm the Flash.

690
00:38:14,189 --> 00:38:16,890
So you were right all along.

691
00:38:16,892 --> 00:38:18,391
We didn't believe you.

692
00:38:18,393 --> 00:38:19,640
I'm sorry.

693
00:38:19,643 --> 00:38:22,062
Don't be. DeVoe's
been playing all of us.

694
00:38:22,064 --> 00:38:23,226
How?

695
00:38:23,229 --> 00:38:24,875
It's his powers.

696
00:38:24,878 --> 00:38:28,067
He has an intelligence beyond
anything we could've imagined.

697
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:30,703
He's orchestrated everything
that we've encountered.

698
00:38:30,705 --> 00:38:32,305
He's moved us like chess pieces

699
00:38:32,307 --> 00:38:34,140
in a game we didn't even
know we were playing.

700
00:38:34,142 --> 00:38:36,376
How do we stop someone
who has super intelligence?

701
00:38:36,378 --> 00:38:38,044
We're pretty smart.

702
00:38:38,046 --> 00:38:39,112
Maybe we're not.

703
00:38:49,091 --> 00:38:50,390
The Thinker!

704
00:38:50,392 --> 00:38:51,758
It's good. Apt sense of menace.

705
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,393
Nailed it in one.

706
00:38:53,395 --> 00:38:56,062
Guys, it's gonna take
all of us to stop him.

707
00:38:56,064 --> 00:38:58,768
Sounds like y'all could use a hand.

708
00:38:58,771 --> 00:39:00,333
- Oh.
- Hey!

709
00:39:00,335 --> 00:39:02,469
Wally!

710
00:39:03,371 --> 00:39:05,538
- Good to see you, son!
- You too.

711
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,806
Aww!

712
00:39:06,808 --> 00:39:08,141
How was Blue Valley?

713
00:39:08,143 --> 00:39:09,909
Oh.

714
00:39:09,911 --> 00:39:12,846
Self-reflection and a
battle with a starfish

715
00:39:12,848 --> 00:39:15,748
from outer space gives you perspective.

716
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:17,417
So you found what you were looking for?

717
00:39:17,419 --> 00:39:19,752
I don't know, to be honest.

718
00:39:19,754 --> 00:39:23,323
Well, we are glad you're home.

719
00:39:23,325 --> 00:39:25,492
Looks like you found the
guy behind the bus metas.

720
00:39:25,494 --> 00:39:26,717
Yeah.

721
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,629
So you want to suit up? Take him down?

722
00:39:29,631 --> 00:39:32,031
No, now it's his move.

723
00:39:32,033 --> 00:39:35,592
I think we take our
time, formulate a plan.

724
00:39:37,038 --> 00:39:40,974
What now, boss lady?

725
00:39:40,976 --> 00:39:42,545
We get married.

726
00:39:44,312 --> 00:39:47,147
He came to you, just you said he would.

727
00:39:47,149 --> 00:39:52,352
He's finally seized control of his fear.

728
00:39:52,354 --> 00:39:53,653
He drew his strength

729
00:39:53,655 --> 00:39:57,157
from those he calls friends.

730
00:39:57,159 --> 00:39:58,892
Sounds like you admire him.

731
00:39:58,894 --> 00:40:00,627
It is fascinating.

732
00:40:00,629 --> 00:40:03,796
In the chain of 4,900
possible events I predicted,

733
00:40:03,798 --> 00:40:06,599
there was one which resulted in
them calling me "The Teacher."

734
00:40:09,104 --> 00:40:12,105
I prefer "The Thinker."

735
00:40:12,107 --> 00:40:15,508
They will be the first to
experience the Enlightenment.

736
00:40:16,878 --> 00:40:18,945
You've been unplugged for too long.

737
00:40:23,218 --> 00:40:25,018
I'm nothing without you.

738
00:40:32,561 --> 00:40:34,193
Proceed.

739
00:41:14,269 --> 00:41:15,768
Your body's deteriorating

740
00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:17,403
faster than the chair can handle.

741
00:41:17,405 --> 00:41:21,674
It will survive long enough.

742
00:41:21,676 --> 00:41:24,877
You're really going to
let them get married?

743
00:41:24,879 --> 00:41:27,947
What is knowledge without love?

744
00:41:30,438 --> 00:41:34,617
