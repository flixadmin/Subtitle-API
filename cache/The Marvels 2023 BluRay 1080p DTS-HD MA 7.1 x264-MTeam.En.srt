1
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,586
There's only one here.

2
00:02:21,962 --> 00:02:23,606
They were forged as a pair.

3
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:26,484
We'll keep looking for it.
It must be buried elsewhere.

4
00:02:26,508 --> 00:02:27,676
Elsewhere?

5
00:02:29,886 --> 00:02:31,054
Like where?

6
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:48,947
Kamala! Are you
doing your homework, beta?

7
00:02:49,031 --> 00:02:50,866
Yeah! Science!

8
00:03:00,334 --> 00:03:01,335
Boom!

9
00:03:01,752 --> 00:03:03,420
Enter, Kamala Khan.

10
00:03:03,754 --> 00:03:04,755
Ready for...

11
00:03:05,547 --> 00:03:07,674
Captain Marvel.

12
00:03:08,884 --> 00:03:09,982
She needs my help.

13
00:03:10,761 --> 00:03:12,554
Shine on, baby.

14
00:03:16,391 --> 00:03:18,465
Ugh! Why are hands
so hard to draw?

15
00:03:18,852 --> 00:03:21,938
Okay, Ms. Marvel arrives,
and just in time,

16
00:03:22,022 --> 00:03:23,875
'cause even the Avengers
need backup, ya know?

17
00:03:23,899 --> 00:03:25,359
Wham! Kapow!

18
00:03:28,028 --> 00:03:30,280
This is my chance!

19
00:03:33,283 --> 00:03:34,284
Pow!

20
00:03:35,952 --> 00:03:36,953
Boom!

21
00:03:38,622 --> 00:03:39,664
Not bad, kid.

22
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:42,709
What's your name?

23
00:03:42,793 --> 00:03:44,211
Ms. Marvel.

24
00:03:44,294 --> 00:03:45,295
Dude.

25
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:46,463
Twinsies!

26
00:03:48,048 --> 00:03:49,859
Hey, you wanna go party
with the Avengers?

27
00:03:49,883 --> 00:03:51,635
Uh... Yeah!

28
00:03:52,302 --> 00:03:54,096
Oh, uh, can you fly?

29
00:03:54,179 --> 00:03:57,140
No, but, um, I can do this!

30
00:03:58,308 --> 00:03:59,393
Kamala!

31
00:03:59,476 --> 00:04:01,311
Don't make me come up there!

32
00:04:02,979 --> 00:04:04,791
That does not sound like science to me.

33
00:04:04,815 --> 00:04:05,816
Okay.

34
00:04:29,464 --> 00:04:31,758
You don't remember anything?

35
00:04:32,217 --> 00:04:33,760
I see...

36
00:04:34,261 --> 00:04:35,345
flashes.

37
00:04:37,597 --> 00:04:38,640
Little moments.

38
00:04:39,182 --> 00:04:42,370
If I could just piece together
what happened that morning,

39
00:04:42,394 --> 00:04:44,104
maybe it'll all make sense.

40
00:04:53,613 --> 00:04:56,867
You stole me from my home,
my family, my friends.

41
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,201
Lieutenant Trouble.

42
00:04:58,869 --> 00:05:00,179
Higher, further, faster, baby.

43
00:05:00,203 --> 00:05:01,204
That's right.

44
00:05:01,872 --> 00:05:05,059
Tell the Supreme Intelligence
that I'm coming to end it.

45
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:06,960
The war, the lies.

46
00:05:07,794 --> 00:05:09,963
- All of it.
- You can't do this.

47
00:05:10,505 --> 00:05:11,732
I'll be back before you know it.

48
00:05:11,756 --> 00:05:13,609
I could fly up and meet you halfway.

49
00:05:13,633 --> 00:05:16,804
Oh, only if you learn to glow
like your Auntie Carol.

50
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,295
Come here, Goosey.

51
00:05:52,589 --> 00:05:54,549
Incoming call from Nick Fury.

52
00:05:54,633 --> 00:05:57,093
Oh. You expecting a call?

53
00:05:57,177 --> 00:05:59,679
Maybe we just send it to voice mail.

54
00:06:03,016 --> 00:06:04,267
Nick Fury,

55
00:06:04,351 --> 00:06:06,937
my favorite one-eyed man of intrigue.

56
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,146
Carol Danvers.

57
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:10,273
Prodigal child of the Milky Way.

58
00:06:10,357 --> 00:06:11,542
How goes it out there?

59
00:06:11,566 --> 00:06:13,235
Thriving.

60
00:06:14,486 --> 00:06:16,279
What the hell was that?

61
00:06:16,363 --> 00:06:17,405
- Goose?
- Yeah.

62
00:06:17,489 --> 00:06:19,199
What about you?

63
00:06:19,282 --> 00:06:20,450
How are you doing?

64
00:06:20,534 --> 00:06:22,053
What do you know about the surge

65
00:06:22,077 --> 00:06:24,577
in the jump point system a few hours ago?

66
00:06:24,788 --> 00:06:26,915
I didn't notice anything unusual.

67
00:06:26,998 --> 00:06:28,583
I'll take a look now.

68
00:06:28,667 --> 00:06:29,936
It rattled the whole system.

69
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,604
We're trying to get a handle
on what happened.

70
00:06:31,628 --> 00:06:33,147
The entire network was affected?

71
00:06:33,171 --> 00:06:34,673
Yeah. End to end.

72
00:06:35,423 --> 00:06:36,984
Thankfully, our neural network team

73
00:06:37,008 --> 00:06:40,011
was able to trace the origin
back to MB-418.

74
00:06:40,512 --> 00:06:41,656
You're in the neighborhood, right?

75
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,681
Yeah.

76
00:06:43,306 --> 00:06:44,587
Can you check it out?

77
00:06:45,267 --> 00:06:47,227
- I'm on it.
- Appreciate you.

78
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:50,331
Monica and her team will send
more intel as they acquire it.

79
00:06:50,355 --> 00:06:51,856
Monica? Wha...

80
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,000
What's she doing there?

81
00:06:53,024 --> 00:06:54,085
I thought that she was on Earth.

82
00:06:54,109 --> 00:06:55,902
- Is she okay?
- Yeah.

83
00:06:56,528 --> 00:06:59,089
And she's not
that little kid you remember.

84
00:07:14,421 --> 00:07:17,882
So, do we think that we can
finish this before dinner?

85
00:07:17,966 --> 00:07:19,819
Yeah. I don't think
we're gonna fix it in time

86
00:07:19,843 --> 00:07:22,053
to get a reading on the jump point.

87
00:07:22,137 --> 00:07:25,724
But I do know someone
with superpowers who could.

88
00:07:27,267 --> 00:07:29,769
Fine. I'll go.

89
00:07:29,853 --> 00:07:32,582
You guys head in and check
the status of the network.

90
00:07:32,606 --> 00:07:35,334
We've gotta find this damage
and see if we can reverse it.

91
00:07:35,358 --> 00:07:36,456
Aye, aye, Captain.

92
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,724
Fury,

93
00:08:07,807 --> 00:08:09,559
I think I found something.

94
00:08:09,976 --> 00:08:11,770
Communications override.

95
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:14,105
Captain Rambeau. Spacewalk.

96
00:08:14,189 --> 00:08:15,190
Connected.

97
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:16,900
Rambeau,

98
00:08:16,983 --> 00:08:18,544
what the hell are you doin'?

99
00:08:18,568 --> 00:08:21,088
Seems the surge has had
some residual effect

100
00:08:21,112 --> 00:08:22,572
on the jump point.

101
00:08:22,656 --> 00:08:24,383
I'm gonna get you some readings, Fury.

102
00:08:24,407 --> 00:08:25,450
Mon...

103
00:08:25,533 --> 00:08:27,118
- Hello?
- Monica.

104
00:08:27,202 --> 00:08:28,286
Hello?

105
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,795
Was that Monica?

106
00:08:37,587 --> 00:08:38,630
Aunt Carol?

107
00:08:38,713 --> 00:08:39,774
Fury, was that Monica?

108
00:08:39,798 --> 00:08:41,445
Why, you wanna talk to her?

109
00:08:41,633 --> 00:08:43,653
I... I don't think
I'm in the best...

110
00:08:43,677 --> 00:08:46,346
position to... I... I don't...

111
00:08:46,429 --> 00:08:47,681
I don't wanna...

112
00:08:47,764 --> 00:08:48,765
Look...

113
00:08:48,848 --> 00:08:50,368
I don't wanna talk to her like this.

114
00:08:50,392 --> 00:08:52,453
- Not after all this time.
- You know,

115
00:08:52,477 --> 00:08:53,996
eventually you're gonna
have to talk to her.

116
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,021
I know.

117
00:08:55,105 --> 00:08:56,147
I know, but

118
00:08:56,231 --> 00:08:59,341
let's save the family reunions
till I'm back inside.

119
00:09:07,117 --> 00:09:09,557
I think I found the source of the surge.

120
00:09:10,495 --> 00:09:11,715
What are you seeing?

121
00:09:13,081 --> 00:09:16,751
It's a jump point,
but it's not closing. Like...

122
00:09:17,544 --> 00:09:18,795
it's stuck.

123
00:09:18,878 --> 00:09:19,963
Danvers.

124
00:09:34,018 --> 00:09:35,019
Danvers.

125
00:09:36,229 --> 00:09:37,230
Danvers!

126
00:09:43,445 --> 00:09:45,464
The jump point's still leaking energy.

127
00:09:45,488 --> 00:09:47,074
- Captain Rambeau?
- Hello?

128
00:09:47,991 --> 00:09:50,118
- Hello?
- Monica.

129
00:09:58,001 --> 00:09:59,294
Beautiful.

130
00:10:32,619 --> 00:10:35,371
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God!

131
00:10:40,794 --> 00:10:43,904
Stop spinning, stop spinning,
stop spinning, please!

132
00:10:49,511 --> 00:10:51,971
It's Nick Fury! Hey!

133
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:54,307
How did you... Oh, wow.

134
00:10:55,016 --> 00:10:56,226
I'm Kamala Khan.

135
00:10:56,309 --> 00:10:58,245
No, sorry, I'm Ms. Marvel, actually.

136
00:10:58,269 --> 00:10:59,789
But I'm from Jersey City and I...

137
00:10:59,813 --> 00:11:02,023
Oh, no, I don't have my mask on.

138
00:11:02,106 --> 00:11:04,234
Is this an Avengers test?

139
00:11:04,818 --> 00:11:06,945
Who the hell are you?

140
00:11:36,599 --> 00:11:37,600
Hi.

141
00:11:38,268 --> 00:11:40,311
Really good living room.

142
00:11:42,564 --> 00:11:43,857
- Kamala?
- Kamala?

143
00:11:52,448 --> 00:11:53,717
What did you do to me?

144
00:11:53,741 --> 00:11:55,928
- What is Dar-Benn doing?
- It's too late.

145
00:11:55,952 --> 00:11:58,121
The Supremor's already on Tarnax.

146
00:11:58,204 --> 00:12:00,915
You can't stop this.

147
00:12:00,999 --> 00:12:02,166
Watch me.

148
00:12:16,264 --> 00:12:18,141
Fury. It's the Kree.

149
00:12:18,224 --> 00:12:20,160
They're going after
the Skrulls on Tarnax.

150
00:12:20,184 --> 00:12:23,354
Now, hold on.
Do not go in swinging.

151
00:12:23,438 --> 00:12:24,480
This is a peace

152
00:12:24,564 --> 00:12:25,916
- and reconciliation tour.
- Fury.

153
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,817
- I got this.
- Carol...

154
00:12:30,695 --> 00:12:33,048
So, I switched with
someone named Kamala Khan?

155
00:12:33,072 --> 00:12:35,342
Yeah. She seemed to be
as confused as you are.

156
00:12:35,366 --> 00:12:37,595
Well, there's nothing in her
power-set about teleportation.

157
00:12:37,619 --> 00:12:38,703
Enough about her.

158
00:12:38,786 --> 00:12:41,456
I wanna know what happened
to you on MB-418.

159
00:12:41,539 --> 00:12:42,790
Yes, sir. Uh...

160
00:12:42,874 --> 00:12:45,686
Let me preface this by saying
I'm not really sure. But...

161
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:47,855
I did not break my closet door, okay?

162
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:48,963
I was in space.

163
00:12:49,047 --> 00:12:50,798
Oh, so it broke itself?

164
00:12:50,882 --> 00:12:52,693
No, no, no, no, no.
See, I disappeared.

165
00:12:52,717 --> 00:12:54,730
So maybe Captain Marvel broke it.

166
00:12:55,094 --> 00:12:56,554
- What?
- Yes,

167
00:12:56,638 --> 00:12:58,324
your friend, Captain Marvel.

168
00:12:58,348 --> 00:13:00,326
She was walking up and down
our living room,

169
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,535
and now you come back,

170
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:03,203
waltzing in with no apologies.

171
00:13:03,227 --> 00:13:05,414
I'm sorry, Captain Marvel
was in our house?

172
00:13:05,438 --> 00:13:08,399
Is Captain Marvel
pressuring you in any way?

173
00:13:08,816 --> 00:13:10,878
Look, I understand
that she's an important figure

174
00:13:10,902 --> 00:13:13,422
and all that, but you don't
have to do as she says.

175
00:13:13,446 --> 00:13:15,591
No, no, they're clearly working together.

176
00:13:15,615 --> 00:13:16,652
Look at her face.

177
00:13:16,699 --> 00:13:17,760
- Look at her smile.
- Aamir, stop it.

178
00:13:17,784 --> 00:13:18,844
She's being super secretive as always.

179
00:13:18,868 --> 00:13:19,929
Aamir, stop picking on your sister.

180
00:13:19,953 --> 00:13:21,013
- Look at her.
- Muneeba.

181
00:13:21,037 --> 00:13:22,473
Kamala, are you lying again?

182
00:13:22,497 --> 00:13:23,557
Just tell me if you're involved or...

183
00:13:23,581 --> 00:13:24,642
My daughter has said she's not lying.

184
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:25,726
- Kamala.
- Looks like

185
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:26,810
- she's having so much fun.
- Muneeba...

186
00:13:26,834 --> 00:13:30,493
- She's bad at keeping secrets.
- Oh, my God! It's happening!

187
00:13:36,678 --> 00:13:38,763
Approaching Tarnax.

188
00:13:43,267 --> 00:13:44,268
Warning.

189
00:13:44,352 --> 00:13:45,895
Kree ship detected.

190
00:14:33,693 --> 00:14:35,921
This is not what we agreed, Dar-Benn.

191
00:14:35,945 --> 00:14:37,155
Supremor Dar-Benn.

192
00:14:37,238 --> 00:14:39,490
The Skrull have been scattered

193
00:14:39,574 --> 00:14:41,743
to every corner of the universe.

194
00:14:41,826 --> 00:14:44,996
Made refugees wherever we go, and still,

195
00:14:45,538 --> 00:14:49,876
we came into these
negotiations in good faith.

196
00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:51,794
I hear you, Dro'ge.

197
00:14:53,296 --> 00:14:54,815
I, perhaps more than anyone,

198
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:57,776
understand what you and
your people have been through.

199
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,136
After my predecessor was destroyed,

200
00:15:00,803 --> 00:15:03,056
heretics rose up to fill the void.

201
00:15:04,932 --> 00:15:06,910
The Civil War has polluted our skies.

202
00:15:06,934 --> 00:15:08,644
My people cannot breathe.

203
00:15:11,189 --> 00:15:12,648
Our sun is dying.

204
00:15:13,107 --> 00:15:15,318
Hala is out of time.

205
00:15:16,194 --> 00:15:18,085
I hope we can rebuild together.

206
00:15:18,404 --> 00:15:20,132
So much so that I'm willing to put

207
00:15:20,156 --> 00:15:22,325
our ancient animosities behind us.

208
00:15:23,868 --> 00:15:26,551
And give you a chance
to protect your people.

209
00:15:27,955 --> 00:15:29,290
To stop running.

210
00:15:33,127 --> 00:15:35,189
The Skrull will take their rightful place

211
00:15:35,213 --> 00:15:36,422
in the Kree Empire.

212
00:15:38,382 --> 00:15:40,517
And I will aid in their relocation.

213
00:15:40,551 --> 00:15:42,303
Relocation? What?

214
00:15:43,471 --> 00:15:45,179
What is the meaning of this?

215
00:15:46,349 --> 00:15:48,410
I would hate for your people to suffocate

216
00:15:48,434 --> 00:15:50,142
when I strip the atmosphere.

217
00:16:08,788 --> 00:16:10,289
It's the Annihilator!

218
00:16:24,846 --> 00:16:26,722
Oh, my God!

219
00:16:37,525 --> 00:16:38,585
What the hell is going on?

220
00:16:38,609 --> 00:16:40,337
Yes, what the hell is going on?

221
00:16:40,361 --> 00:16:42,214
I was on some freaky spaceship
and then I teleported here.

222
00:16:42,238 --> 00:16:43,465
I don't know if that's my new power.

223
00:16:43,489 --> 00:16:44,716
And then this freaking cat ate a man.

224
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,843
How can a cat eat a man, Kamala?

225
00:16:45,867 --> 00:16:46,927
I don't know.
It has tentacles

226
00:16:46,951 --> 00:16:48,053
- and it ate a man.
- What tentacles, Kamala?

227
00:16:48,077 --> 00:16:49,179
- I don't know.
- Where are the tentacles?

228
00:16:49,203 --> 00:16:50,514
It comes out of his mouth, and they're...

229
00:16:50,538 --> 00:16:51,956
Oh, my God!

230
00:16:53,124 --> 00:16:55,137
Oh, my God, it's happening again!

231
00:16:59,505 --> 00:17:03,050
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
- Kamala, who are they?

232
00:17:05,845 --> 00:17:07,180
Please run.

233
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,161
How did you get here,

234
00:17:12,185 --> 00:17:13,662
and how're you involved in this?

235
00:17:13,686 --> 00:17:16,189
The Kree jury-rigged
a wormhole on MB-418.

236
00:17:16,272 --> 00:17:17,332
You mean like a jump point?

237
00:17:17,356 --> 00:17:19,793
I don't know.
But I touched it and then I...

238
00:17:19,817 --> 00:17:20,915
Why'd you do that?

239
00:17:20,985 --> 00:17:22,713
Because it was glowing and mysterious.

240
00:17:22,737 --> 00:17:24,590
Okay, new rule, no more touching shit.

241
00:17:24,614 --> 00:17:26,133
Especially glowing, mysterious shit.

242
00:17:26,157 --> 00:17:27,801
Okay, I'm feeling a lot of
negative energy from you

243
00:17:27,825 --> 00:17:29,261
and I don't like it.
That's not the point.

244
00:17:29,285 --> 00:17:31,763
The point is, is that it was
siphoning off the atmosphere.

245
00:17:31,787 --> 00:17:33,039
And it did this!

246
00:17:33,623 --> 00:17:34,766
Scissors beat paper.

247
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:36,810
Fury! There was, like, energy
that went around my hand.

248
00:17:36,834 --> 00:17:37,960
Focus.

249
00:17:38,461 --> 00:17:39,986
Okay, maybe if I do this.

250
00:17:46,719 --> 00:17:47,762
Annihilator.

251
00:17:47,845 --> 00:17:49,248
I don't like that name.

252
00:18:21,379 --> 00:18:23,422
- Friends of yours?
- Hi.

253
00:18:49,156 --> 00:18:51,117
Annihilator!

254
00:19:11,429 --> 00:19:12,930
Annihilator!

255
00:19:44,628 --> 00:19:46,422
Aamir, get him!

256
00:19:46,922 --> 00:19:48,924
Get him! Hit him!

257
00:20:03,522 --> 00:20:04,690
Yusuf! Oh!

258
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:16,202
Let me go! Let me go!
Let me go!

259
00:20:31,926 --> 00:20:33,594
Kamala, are you okay?

260
00:20:38,974 --> 00:20:39,975
Fury!

261
00:20:40,351 --> 00:20:41,828
I think I'm getting teleported

262
00:20:41,852 --> 00:20:44,596
whenever I channel
any kind of radiant ener...

263
00:20:46,148 --> 00:20:47,918
I think I switch when I use my powers.

264
00:20:47,942 --> 00:20:49,110
Strong theory.

265
00:20:57,118 --> 00:20:58,327
Strong theory.

266
00:20:59,495 --> 00:21:01,973
Our tests keep
generating the same result.

267
00:21:01,997 --> 00:21:03,874
With each new jump point,

268
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:06,419
this band becomes more unstable.

269
00:21:06,502 --> 00:21:09,307
I strongly suggest we wait
for the second band.

270
00:21:57,595 --> 00:21:59,680
Oi.

271
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,100
Hi, again.

272
00:22:03,976 --> 00:22:06,061
So sorry about earlier.

273
00:22:06,145 --> 00:22:07,831
We're looking for Kamala Khan.

274
00:22:07,855 --> 00:22:09,690
Did I get in?

275
00:22:10,816 --> 00:22:12,586
Is this the new iPad?
I haven't seen it yet.

276
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:13,611
They wish!

277
00:22:13,694 --> 00:22:14,838
- All right. Come on, let's go.
- I know.

278
00:22:14,862 --> 00:22:16,381
Wait, if this is
all top secret information,

279
00:22:16,405 --> 00:22:18,717
- why is it on a clear case?
- Uh, well...

280
00:22:18,741 --> 00:22:20,284
...just swipe it

281
00:22:20,367 --> 00:22:21,428
a little bit... Whoa, whoa.

282
00:22:21,452 --> 00:22:22,762
- Hi. Okay.
- Can you believe it?

283
00:22:22,786 --> 00:22:24,705
They have intel on me.

284
00:22:24,788 --> 00:22:25,915
On me!

285
00:22:26,665 --> 00:22:27,833
I am intel.

286
00:22:28,501 --> 00:22:30,836
Look at you!

287
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,023
Hey, what does, um,
S.A.B.E.R. stand for?

288
00:22:33,047 --> 00:22:34,941
Uh, Strategic Aerospace Biophysics

289
00:22:34,965 --> 00:22:36,359
and Exolinguistic Response.

290
00:22:36,383 --> 00:22:37,510
That's classified.

291
00:22:37,885 --> 00:22:38,886
Sorry.

292
00:22:39,762 --> 00:22:41,305
"Hard Light powers," yes.

293
00:22:41,388 --> 00:22:42,449
- "Noor..."
- Okay,

294
00:22:42,473 --> 00:22:43,992
but why do you have intel on her?

295
00:22:44,016 --> 00:22:45,869
Is there some sort of surveillance on us?

296
00:22:45,893 --> 00:22:47,162
"Surveillance" is a strong word.

297
00:22:47,186 --> 00:22:48,270
Well, ma'am,

298
00:22:48,354 --> 00:22:51,281
your daughter is the hero
that saved Jersey City.

299
00:22:51,649 --> 00:22:52,959
So, of course we would have intel

300
00:22:52,983 --> 00:22:54,628
on someone like her.
And you're also

301
00:22:54,652 --> 00:22:56,213
electromagnetically altered.

302
00:22:56,237 --> 00:22:57,457
What does that mean?

303
00:22:57,530 --> 00:22:59,907
Oh, it just means that we both have

304
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:01,742
light-based powers.

305
00:23:02,243 --> 00:23:04,346
What's your...
What's your code name?

306
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:05,805
Oh, I don't have a code name.

307
00:23:05,829 --> 00:23:08,025
- We'll workshop it.
- No, thank you.

308
00:23:08,207 --> 00:23:09,305
Aunt Carol... Mmm.

309
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:12,044
Captain Marvel
also has light-based powers.

310
00:23:12,127 --> 00:23:13,647
It's probably not a coincidence.

311
00:23:13,671 --> 00:23:16,775
Not to mention the two of you
came into direct contact

312
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,056
with some malfunctioning jump points.

313
00:23:19,134 --> 00:23:21,613
I still cannot believe
that Captain Marvel was here

314
00:23:21,637 --> 00:23:22,781
and I didn't even get to meet her.

315
00:23:22,805 --> 00:23:23,865
You know, we're supposed to be all,

316
00:23:23,889 --> 00:23:24,950
like, "twinsies!" you know.

317
00:23:24,974 --> 00:23:27,244
We have the same name.
I would obviously, then...

318
00:23:27,268 --> 00:23:28,537
I don't know, I would just
give her the letter

319
00:23:28,561 --> 00:23:29,621
that I wrote for her

320
00:23:29,645 --> 00:23:32,082
and we would go out for lunch,
and then it would just...

321
00:23:32,106 --> 00:23:34,567
Did you say "Aunt Carol?"

322
00:23:35,317 --> 00:23:38,237
I said that Captain Marvel

323
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,155
can absorb light energy.

324
00:23:40,239 --> 00:23:41,574
I can see it.

325
00:23:41,657 --> 00:23:43,909
And you, you can turn light

326
00:23:43,993 --> 00:23:45,578
into physical matter.

327
00:23:45,661 --> 00:23:47,097
Which I have never heard of.

328
00:23:47,121 --> 00:23:48,807
- But my working theory...
- I could totally show you.

329
00:23:48,831 --> 00:23:50,416
No!

330
00:23:52,293 --> 00:23:54,461
What the...

331
00:23:57,506 --> 00:23:58,507
Hi.

332
00:23:59,466 --> 00:24:00,467
Hi.

333
00:24:01,635 --> 00:24:04,471
Nah, they don't seem related.

334
00:24:04,555 --> 00:24:05,723
Whatever, Yusuf.

335
00:24:05,806 --> 00:24:08,267
- Families are complicated.
- Hmm.

336
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:11,353
Uh, Monica, you wanna fill Carol in

337
00:24:11,437 --> 00:24:13,105
on your working theory?

338
00:24:13,647 --> 00:24:14,773
Yeah. Um...

339
00:24:14,857 --> 00:24:16,734
Hi, Captain Marvel.

340
00:24:18,193 --> 00:24:21,030
It is so good to see you,
Lieutenant Trouble.

341
00:24:21,113 --> 00:24:22,281
You too.

342
00:24:22,364 --> 00:24:24,133
And it's Captain Rambeau now.

343
00:24:25,284 --> 00:24:27,161
Right. Sorry.

344
00:24:30,331 --> 00:24:31,749
So, what's new?

345
00:24:31,832 --> 00:24:33,268
- Where's my sister?
- Yeah.

346
00:24:33,292 --> 00:24:36,003
I'm thinking that our joint exposure

347
00:24:36,086 --> 00:24:37,689
to these unsteady jump points

348
00:24:37,713 --> 00:24:40,799
and our susceptibility
to electromagnetic energy

349
00:24:40,883 --> 00:24:43,069
has temporarily entangled our world-lines.

350
00:24:43,093 --> 00:24:44,557
Yeah, that, right there.

351
00:24:45,471 --> 00:24:46,813
- Uh...
- Entanglement.

352
00:24:46,889 --> 00:24:49,016
Our light powers are entangled.

353
00:24:49,099 --> 00:24:51,995
So, we switch places whenever
we use them at the same time.

354
00:24:52,019 --> 00:24:54,623
- Which would mean Kamala...
- When did you get powers?

355
00:24:54,647 --> 00:24:57,042
I walked through
a radiation shielding barrier

356
00:24:57,066 --> 00:24:59,461
of a witch hex and now
I can manipulate and see

357
00:24:59,485 --> 00:25:01,546
all wavelengths of
the electromagnetic spectrum.

358
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:02,631
I'm very happy for you.

359
00:25:02,655 --> 00:25:03,989
Yeah.

360
00:25:04,073 --> 00:25:06,468
- Where's our daughter?
- Yes, please. Where is Kamala?

361
00:25:06,492 --> 00:25:07,660
Wherever you were.

362
00:25:07,743 --> 00:25:09,095
- Where were you?
- Who's Kamala?

363
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:11,431
The third person we're switching with.

364
00:25:11,455 --> 00:25:13,290
Light powers. Teenage girl.

365
00:25:13,374 --> 00:25:15,018
- Where were you?
- What are you doing?

366
00:25:15,042 --> 00:25:16,210
What are you doing?

367
00:25:16,293 --> 00:25:17,896
I'm trying to switch.
Why isn't it working

368
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,147
- when I need it to work?
- Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

369
00:25:19,171 --> 00:25:20,231
- Danvers, Danvers!
- Hey!

370
00:25:20,255 --> 00:25:21,566
- So confused.
- Please tell Kamala

371
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:22,901
that her Abu is very upset.

372
00:25:22,925 --> 00:25:24,694
Where are we going
and why are we going there?

373
00:25:24,718 --> 00:25:27,388
- Carol!
- Carol, where you going?

374
00:25:36,855 --> 00:25:38,774
Oh, my God!

375
00:25:38,857 --> 00:25:40,150
- Uh-oh!
- Monica...

376
00:25:40,234 --> 00:25:41,670
- Mmm-hmm?
- ...you gotta fly.

377
00:25:41,694 --> 00:25:42,986
No, no, no. I...

378
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:44,196
I mean, I know.

379
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:45,924
But technically, I haven't done that yet!

380
00:25:45,948 --> 00:25:47,467
Yeah, well, you got to now

381
00:25:47,491 --> 00:25:49,761
or Kamala's not gonna graduate
from high school.

382
00:25:49,785 --> 00:25:51,188
Come on! Use your core!

383
00:25:54,915 --> 00:25:55,958
Oh, jeez.

384
00:25:56,041 --> 00:25:57,918
Hey. Black Girl Magic.

385
00:26:19,273 --> 00:26:20,899
I got you! I got you!

386
00:26:21,233 --> 00:26:22,901
I got you!

387
00:26:42,838 --> 00:26:44,214
Hold on!

388
00:26:45,382 --> 00:26:46,967
What is happening?

389
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:49,490
I can't hold on to you while I'm flying.

390
00:26:50,763 --> 00:26:53,724
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

391
00:26:53,807 --> 00:26:55,326
- We're gonna die!
- Hold on!

392
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:57,287
Hold on! I'm thinking,
I'm thinking!

393
00:26:57,311 --> 00:26:59,480
Wait, I have an idea.

394
00:26:59,563 --> 00:27:00,689
Grab on to me!

395
00:27:03,484 --> 00:27:06,069
This had better work!

396
00:27:07,863 --> 00:27:09,948
Oh, it's cool. It's Carol.

397
00:27:15,496 --> 00:27:17,706
Okay, no powers,
no powers. Just...

398
00:27:30,052 --> 00:27:31,345
Who are they?

399
00:27:31,428 --> 00:27:35,015
They are associates of Captain Marvel.

400
00:27:37,768 --> 00:27:39,269
The Annihilator is here?

401
00:27:39,353 --> 00:27:40,604
Yeah, well, she was.

402
00:27:40,687 --> 00:27:43,124
And then these two just sort of appeared.

403
00:27:43,148 --> 00:27:44,368
What about the band?

404
00:27:44,441 --> 00:27:46,085
If she's meddling, I need to strike now.

405
00:27:46,109 --> 00:27:48,296
Yeah. I still can't
account for the instabilities

406
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,571
exhibited on MB-418.

407
00:27:49,655 --> 00:27:51,674
This thing does much more than just...

408
00:27:51,698 --> 00:27:52,866
But it works?

409
00:27:53,951 --> 00:27:56,054
Yes. Yes.
But if you give me more time,

410
00:27:56,078 --> 00:27:57,830
- I can make it safer.
- No.

411
00:27:57,913 --> 00:27:59,832
No. We do it now.

412
00:28:00,833 --> 00:28:03,126
Before the Annihilator appears.

413
00:28:21,061 --> 00:28:22,896
Uh, what should we do about...

414
00:28:23,772 --> 00:28:24,773
these two?

415
00:28:38,954 --> 00:28:40,372
You.

416
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:44,084
Hold that thought.

417
00:29:13,864 --> 00:29:15,049
We gotta get that band off of her.

418
00:29:15,073 --> 00:29:16,408
It looks like mine.

419
00:29:16,992 --> 00:29:18,118
Guys!

420
00:29:28,128 --> 00:29:29,838
I can't fly.

421
00:29:31,006 --> 00:29:33,526
Do you guys have a spaceship
I could borrow or...

422
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:35,111
Kamala, don't talk to them.

423
00:29:35,135 --> 00:29:36,678
You know my name!

424
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:48,899
The Kree came here hopeful

425
00:29:48,982 --> 00:29:51,422
that we could build a covenant of peace.

426
00:29:51,485 --> 00:29:52,644
What have you done?

427
00:29:53,362 --> 00:29:56,365
But then you sic the Annihilator on us.

428
00:29:57,908 --> 00:29:59,534
Like we're vermin.

429
00:30:01,203 --> 00:30:05,165
Once again, the Skrull
have betrayed the Kree.

430
00:30:06,208 --> 00:30:07,417
And for that...

431
00:30:33,527 --> 00:30:35,797
Carol, we gotta get
these people out of here.

432
00:30:35,821 --> 00:30:37,114
Emperor Dro'ge,

433
00:30:37,197 --> 00:30:39,454
you need to evacuate your people now.

434
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:43,036
We have nowhere to go.

435
00:31:06,852 --> 00:31:08,186
Carol, the ships...

436
00:31:11,398 --> 00:31:12,984
they're not gonna make it.

437
00:31:14,901 --> 00:31:16,963
Get back to the ship
and don't use your powers.

438
00:31:16,987 --> 00:31:18,530
- But I can help.
- Now.

439
00:32:14,544 --> 00:32:16,421
- Let's go.
- Where's Kamala?

440
00:32:19,049 --> 00:32:20,175
Kamala!

441
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:33,313
No!

442
00:32:42,697 --> 00:32:44,407
Let's go, let's go!

443
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,002
Come on!

444
00:32:56,503 --> 00:32:57,504
Keep moving,

445
00:32:57,587 --> 00:32:59,172
please, please.

446
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,903
All these people, they're gonna...

447
00:33:03,927 --> 00:33:05,238
- Come on, sweetie.
- No! How can you

448
00:33:05,262 --> 00:33:06,405
- just leave them here?
- Kamala, now!

449
00:33:06,429 --> 00:33:08,223
We need to save who we can.

450
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:49,528
Transmission sent.

451
00:33:56,605 --> 00:33:57,606
Hey.

452
00:33:57,939 --> 00:33:59,191
This peace treaty,

453
00:34:00,233 --> 00:34:01,453
it was a good thing.

454
00:34:02,527 --> 00:34:04,696
- It was a ruse.
- If it were,

455
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:07,449
your intervention failed.

456
00:34:08,116 --> 00:34:11,119
We don't need your help anymore.

457
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,124
I called a friend.

458
00:34:16,208 --> 00:34:18,282
She can find a safe place for you.

459
00:34:19,044 --> 00:34:20,253
Is that okay?

460
00:34:21,087 --> 00:34:22,672
We have no choice.

461
00:34:26,051 --> 00:34:27,219
Incoming.

462
00:34:40,982 --> 00:34:42,400
Are you all right?

463
00:34:46,488 --> 00:34:48,740
Thank you again.

464
00:34:49,241 --> 00:34:50,700
Always.

465
00:34:50,784 --> 00:34:53,137
I see that you've finally
found yourself a team.

466
00:34:53,161 --> 00:34:54,305
It is unintentional.

467
00:34:54,329 --> 00:34:57,016
Oh, I've been on some
unintentional teams myself.

468
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,185
- I know, but...
- You can stand tall

469
00:34:59,209 --> 00:35:00,835
without standing alone.

470
00:35:03,338 --> 00:35:04,680
Take it from me, Marv.

471
00:35:12,931 --> 00:35:13,932
Hey.

472
00:35:15,267 --> 00:35:17,036
Captain Marvel will fix this.

473
00:35:17,602 --> 00:35:19,020
I promise.

474
00:35:33,451 --> 00:35:34,703
Thank you.

475
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:40,500
May our next meeting be joyful.

476
00:36:22,542 --> 00:36:23,543
Breathe.

477
00:36:36,264 --> 00:36:37,682
Do you remember?

478
00:36:38,892 --> 00:36:42,020
When the sun used to shine on Hala?

479
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:45,857
How beautiful our home was?

480
00:36:48,902 --> 00:36:50,236
Before her?

481
00:36:56,409 --> 00:36:58,370
Before the Annihilator.

482
00:37:01,373 --> 00:37:02,540
I was there.

483
00:37:09,381 --> 00:37:11,007
I heard her lies,

484
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,118
claiming she was there to set us free.

485
00:37:15,595 --> 00:37:18,723
But when she destroyed
the Supreme Intelligence,

486
00:37:19,432 --> 00:37:21,393
she destroyed the Kree.

487
00:37:28,483 --> 00:37:32,112
For 30 years, I have been
fighting alongside you.

488
00:37:33,154 --> 00:37:35,228
Not only have I brought you peace,

489
00:37:35,824 --> 00:37:39,202
but I have found a way
to return Hala to glory.

490
00:37:39,285 --> 00:37:41,287
Supremor!

491
00:37:41,371 --> 00:37:43,373
Supremor!

492
00:37:45,792 --> 00:37:48,020
We need more power
than that band can provide

493
00:37:48,044 --> 00:37:49,813
if we're to reignite our sun.

494
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,844
That amount of energy...

495
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:53,554
Well, it would kill you.

496
00:37:54,134 --> 00:37:55,778
If my life is the cost, so be it.

497
00:37:55,802 --> 00:37:57,738
We will find the other in time, Suprem...

498
00:37:57,762 --> 00:37:59,389
There is no more time.

499
00:38:01,266 --> 00:38:03,101
Hala is out of time.

500
00:38:25,707 --> 00:38:26,875
Need a hand?

501
00:38:30,545 --> 00:38:31,713
Yeah.

502
00:38:43,808 --> 00:38:46,613
Will you hand me that laser?
Three micrometres.

503
00:38:52,275 --> 00:38:54,712
So you can do that because you
walked through a witch hex?

504
00:38:54,736 --> 00:38:56,196
Yep.

505
00:38:56,279 --> 00:38:57,548
When I got blipped back,

506
00:38:57,572 --> 00:38:59,925
they weren't sending us to space anymore.

507
00:38:59,949 --> 00:39:03,077
Grounded us to investigate
earthbound anomalies.

508
00:39:03,661 --> 00:39:05,097
That must have been hard.

509
00:39:05,121 --> 00:39:06,307
Your mom told me that you

510
00:39:06,331 --> 00:39:08,309
always dreamed of going to space.

511
00:39:08,333 --> 00:39:09,685
That you had something to prove.

512
00:39:09,709 --> 00:39:12,149
You said you'd be back before I knew it.

513
00:39:12,837 --> 00:39:13,963
What?

514
00:39:14,339 --> 00:39:15,715
When you left,

515
00:39:16,549 --> 00:39:19,469
you said you'd be back before I knew it.

516
00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:24,807
I meant what I said.
I just, I didn't know

517
00:39:24,891 --> 00:39:27,644
what I was getting myself into.

518
00:39:27,727 --> 00:39:30,289
I didn't know how to explain
to a little girl that...

519
00:39:30,313 --> 00:39:34,150
A little girl that hung
on your every word.

520
00:39:37,904 --> 00:39:39,572
If you knew...

521
00:39:40,907 --> 00:39:42,784
I was going to come back.

522
00:39:42,867 --> 00:39:44,118
I just...

523
00:39:44,953 --> 00:39:46,905
There was people that needed me.

524
00:39:47,705 --> 00:39:49,374
We needed you, Carol.

525
00:40:08,643 --> 00:40:09,644
Hey.

526
00:40:09,727 --> 00:40:10,788
I hope you don't mind.

527
00:40:10,812 --> 00:40:12,122
I didn't have any other clothes.

528
00:40:12,146 --> 00:40:13,773
It's totally fine.

529
00:40:13,856 --> 00:40:15,316
Looks good on you.

530
00:40:18,194 --> 00:40:19,195
I, um...

531
00:40:20,238 --> 00:40:21,614
I'm really sorry

532
00:40:21,698 --> 00:40:23,345
for the way I spoke to you.

533
00:40:24,784 --> 00:40:25,785
Thank you.

534
00:40:27,912 --> 00:40:30,291
I know that this situation isn't ideal,

535
00:40:30,373 --> 00:40:33,209
but it is actually nice

536
00:40:34,043 --> 00:40:35,878
having people on board again.

537
00:40:38,256 --> 00:40:40,025
It gets pretty lonely out here.

538
00:40:40,049 --> 00:40:42,236
Anytime you need company,
I will be there.

539
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,821
I will drop everything. I will...

540
00:40:43,845 --> 00:40:45,281
I will drop high school.

541
00:40:45,305 --> 00:40:46,806
Don't do that.

542
00:40:47,682 --> 00:40:49,085
But can we start again?

543
00:40:50,602 --> 00:40:53,479
Hi, I'm Carol Danvers.

544
00:40:55,148 --> 00:40:56,566
I am Kamala Khan.

545
00:40:56,649 --> 00:40:58,627
But when I'm fighting crime
on the streets of Jersey City,

546
00:40:58,651 --> 00:41:00,546
I go by Ms. Marvel,
and I hope that's okay,

547
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:01,839
like, copyright-wise.
Because, honestly,

548
00:41:01,863 --> 00:41:03,132
I never thought I'd ever get to meet you.

549
00:41:03,156 --> 00:41:04,216
But now that it's happening

550
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,384
and we're, like, touching each other...

551
00:41:05,408 --> 00:41:07,928
I've realized I should
have asked permission.

552
00:41:07,952 --> 00:41:08,953
So,

553
00:41:10,038 --> 00:41:11,581
twinsies.

554
00:41:12,665 --> 00:41:14,500
Okay. All right.

555
00:41:14,584 --> 00:41:16,461
Here's what we're gonna do.

556
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:17,545
Captain Marvel.

557
00:41:17,629 --> 00:41:18,689
You need to stop calling me that.

558
00:41:18,713 --> 00:41:19,773
I used to change your diapers.

559
00:41:19,797 --> 00:41:20,858
Oh, that was once.

560
00:41:20,882 --> 00:41:22,401
And then I was told you
proceeded to vomit everywhere.

561
00:41:22,425 --> 00:41:25,279
First of all, it's my ship,
so I make the game plan.

562
00:41:25,303 --> 00:41:27,364
Oh, I'm sorry. When's the
last time you led a team?

563
00:41:27,388 --> 00:41:29,867
- As early as last week.
- Goose doesn't count.

564
00:41:29,891 --> 00:41:31,327
Please. You try giving Goose orders.

565
00:41:31,351 --> 00:41:32,411
Oh, my God, we're a team?

566
00:41:32,435 --> 00:41:33,495
- We're not...
- Oh, no, no, no,

567
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:34,622
- we're not a team.
- We're not a team.

568
00:41:34,646 --> 00:41:38,191
I, Kamala Khan of Jersey City,

569
00:41:38,274 --> 00:41:39,752
am on a team with Captain Marvel

570
00:41:39,776 --> 00:41:41,569
and Captain Monica Rambeau,

571
00:41:41,653 --> 00:41:44,702
who from this point onwards
will now be known as...

572
00:41:45,907 --> 00:41:47,343
- Professor Marvel.
- Oh!

573
00:41:47,367 --> 00:41:49,285
Professor Marvel.

574
00:41:49,369 --> 00:41:51,287
No. No, no, she...
she will not.

575
00:41:51,371 --> 00:41:53,201
- But thank you.
- The Marvels.

576
00:41:53,414 --> 00:41:55,225
Now that we've got that
out of the way, team,

577
00:41:55,249 --> 00:41:56,393
I've been trying to tell you,

578
00:41:56,417 --> 00:41:59,563
I think I know how she's
making the weird jump points.

579
00:41:59,587 --> 00:42:00,868
She has one of these.

580
00:42:01,464 --> 00:42:02,965
It's my nani's bangle.

581
00:42:03,341 --> 00:42:05,593
It started glowing really weirdly

582
00:42:05,677 --> 00:42:08,280
when Dar-Benn opened
that first jump point. Also,

583
00:42:08,304 --> 00:42:11,307
it once traveled me
through space and time,

584
00:42:11,391 --> 00:42:13,101
so that's probably related.

585
00:42:14,352 --> 00:42:16,372
What you're describing is a Quantum Band.

586
00:42:16,396 --> 00:42:17,748
I mean, I knew there were two of these.

587
00:42:17,772 --> 00:42:20,542
I just did not expect
the other one to be in space.

588
00:42:20,566 --> 00:42:23,212
They're a pair? How do
you have a Quantum Band?

589
00:42:23,236 --> 00:42:24,755
Okay. What is a Quantum Band?

590
00:42:24,779 --> 00:42:27,073
A myth. Or I thought it was a myth.

591
00:42:27,156 --> 00:42:28,866
It's an ancient artifact.

592
00:42:30,326 --> 00:42:32,680
So this is what Dar-Benn found on MB-418.

593
00:42:32,704 --> 00:42:33,764
And then her and Kamala

594
00:42:33,788 --> 00:42:35,432
just happened to stumble into each other?

595
00:42:35,456 --> 00:42:37,250
I mean, what are the chances?

596
00:42:37,333 --> 00:42:39,252
"What you seek is seeking you."

597
00:42:39,919 --> 00:42:41,713
It's inscribed on the bangle.

598
00:42:41,796 --> 00:42:43,756
If the Kree legends are true,

599
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,651
the Quantum Bands were used to create

600
00:42:45,675 --> 00:42:47,760
every jump point in the universe.

601
00:42:47,844 --> 00:42:49,186
Teleportation network.

602
00:42:49,429 --> 00:42:53,224
Two Quantum Bands working
in unison to connect the galaxy.

603
00:42:53,307 --> 00:42:54,600
So that would explain

604
00:42:54,684 --> 00:42:56,829
our switch-y entanglement situation.

605
00:42:56,853 --> 00:42:59,814
Yeah, yeah, but Dar-Benn only has one.

606
00:42:59,897 --> 00:43:02,483
She must be overloading it
with the energy

607
00:43:02,567 --> 00:43:04,086
from her space hammer thingy.

608
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:05,254
It's called the Universal Weapon.

609
00:43:05,278 --> 00:43:07,756
Oh, really?
I was gonna call it Cosmi-Rod.

610
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:09,991
Either way, she's using it to force

611
00:43:10,074 --> 00:43:12,209
unstable jump points into the grid.

612
00:43:12,452 --> 00:43:15,431
We have got to get to her
before she makes another one.

613
00:43:15,455 --> 00:43:17,725
She had star charts and maps
on the screens on her ship.

614
00:43:17,749 --> 00:43:20,084
Okay. To where?

615
00:43:20,877 --> 00:43:22,962
- To the stars?
- Okay.

616
00:43:23,755 --> 00:43:25,548
It's fine. Got a plan.

617
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:27,628
We will use this.

618
00:43:27,675 --> 00:43:29,903
- Is that...?
- A Skrull torture device.

619
00:43:29,927 --> 00:43:32,221
And, wait, we put it on our heads?

620
00:43:32,305 --> 00:43:36,058
Yes, it's fine.
You use it to access memories.

621
00:43:36,142 --> 00:43:37,977
I've been using it

622
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:41,048
to regain the memories
that the Kree took from me.

623
00:43:41,689 --> 00:43:42,690
Still?

624
00:43:43,149 --> 00:43:44,150
Yeah.

625
00:43:44,233 --> 00:43:46,086
But, you know,
it has a lot of other uses.

626
00:43:46,110 --> 00:43:47,862
It's safe.

627
00:43:48,362 --> 00:43:50,314
You might wanna get comfortable.

628
00:43:56,662 --> 00:43:58,831
Whoa! This is weird.

629
00:43:59,957 --> 00:44:01,167
Wait. Go back.

630
00:44:03,085 --> 00:44:06,172
Her band absorbs your energy
and redirects it.

631
00:44:06,255 --> 00:44:09,675
It's like you gave her power
to use against you.

632
00:44:11,219 --> 00:44:12,220
Kamala?

633
00:44:13,554 --> 00:44:15,139
Hmm. What about this?

634
00:44:15,223 --> 00:44:16,849
There! Those coordinates.

635
00:44:16,933 --> 00:44:18,243
- Can you read that?
- Yes.

636
00:44:18,267 --> 00:44:19,977
The Magellanic Galaxy.

637
00:44:21,854 --> 00:44:23,147
All right,

638
00:44:23,231 --> 00:44:24,374
the pilot seat's all you.

639
00:44:24,398 --> 00:44:27,527
Is that you, Monica?
You're so cute!

640
00:44:28,945 --> 00:44:30,029
No, wait.

641
00:44:30,112 --> 00:44:31,698
Carol, what are you doing?

642
00:44:35,117 --> 00:44:36,762
Why'd you ask me to come, Maria?

643
00:44:36,786 --> 00:44:37,787
Mom.

644
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:41,040
The cancer's back.

645
00:44:42,333 --> 00:44:44,529
So I need you to take care of Goose.

646
00:44:46,295 --> 00:44:47,731
- No.
- What do you mean "no?"

647
00:44:47,755 --> 00:44:49,608
No, I mean, you beat it once.
You'll beat it again.

648
00:44:49,632 --> 00:44:50,716
Carol...

649
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,469
- I'm not taking the cat.
- It's not a cat.

650
00:44:55,555 --> 00:44:57,446
It should've been you that day.

651
00:44:58,266 --> 00:45:00,268
That stupid race to the hangar.

652
00:45:00,351 --> 00:45:02,645
I never wanted to be Captain Marvel.

653
00:45:03,312 --> 00:45:05,815
Captain Rambeau suits me just fine.

654
00:45:06,274 --> 00:45:08,901
And it's just until Monica gets back.

655
00:45:11,445 --> 00:45:12,697
She blipped.

656
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:14,258
Carol, I don't wanna relive this.

657
00:45:14,282 --> 00:45:15,575
I'm sorry.

658
00:45:19,871 --> 00:45:21,622
Stop now, please, Carol!

659
00:45:21,706 --> 00:45:23,666
Remember why you're out there.

660
00:45:23,749 --> 00:45:25,060
I'm looking for a patient in room 104.

661
00:45:25,084 --> 00:45:26,687
I don't know.
I don't know what to tell you.

662
00:45:26,711 --> 00:45:28,297
And remember to come home.

663
00:45:28,462 --> 00:45:30,423
Your mom, she died, honey.

664
00:45:30,506 --> 00:45:32,717
No. No, no, no!

665
00:45:37,471 --> 00:45:38,615
Never do that again.

666
00:45:38,639 --> 00:45:40,576
I'm sorry. It wasn't on purpose.

667
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:41,785
Wait, so your mom...

668
00:45:41,809 --> 00:45:44,312
Passed away while I was blipped.

669
00:45:45,187 --> 00:45:46,468
And when I came back,

670
00:45:46,731 --> 00:45:48,107
no one was there.

671
00:45:54,322 --> 00:45:55,907
Okay.

672
00:46:02,955 --> 00:46:04,749
Thank you.

673
00:46:07,919 --> 00:46:10,171
She seemed really cool. I'm sorry.

674
00:46:10,713 --> 00:46:11,923
She was.

675
00:46:12,423 --> 00:46:13,591
She was the best.

676
00:46:16,093 --> 00:46:19,264
Well, we have to make do
with what we know right now.

677
00:46:20,056 --> 00:46:22,183
Here is what we do know.

678
00:46:22,266 --> 00:46:24,369
The Universal Neural
Teleportation Network

679
00:46:24,393 --> 00:46:25,746
is a system of wormholes

680
00:46:25,770 --> 00:46:26,872
through the space-time continuum

681
00:46:26,896 --> 00:46:28,105
aka, jump points,

682
00:46:28,189 --> 00:46:30,959
which allows us to hop between
different planetary systems.

683
00:46:30,983 --> 00:46:33,420
Basically, it stretches
and reconfigures space

684
00:46:33,444 --> 00:46:35,297
without rupturing the continuum.

685
00:46:35,321 --> 00:46:37,949
Like fracking, the more holes you drill,

686
00:46:38,032 --> 00:46:40,302
the more destabilized the shale becomes,

687
00:46:40,326 --> 00:46:41,729
and then... earthquake.

688
00:46:43,913 --> 00:46:46,266
Bottom line, if she keeps
creating these jump points,

689
00:46:46,290 --> 00:46:48,352
it's gonna get really bad, really fast.

690
00:46:48,376 --> 00:46:50,753
Question is, what does she want?

691
00:46:51,712 --> 00:46:54,131
Tarnax used to be occupied by the Kree,

692
00:46:54,215 --> 00:46:56,384
so maybe the attack was a warning?

693
00:46:56,467 --> 00:46:58,695
So, she could be after
another former colony?

694
00:46:58,719 --> 00:47:00,364
Is there a former Kree colony
in the Magellanic?

695
00:47:00,388 --> 00:47:02,074
At one point, the Kree colonized

696
00:47:02,098 --> 00:47:04,600
25% of the galaxy, so...

697
00:47:04,684 --> 00:47:06,745
If all she wanted was to destroy Tarnax,

698
00:47:06,769 --> 00:47:09,373
why not bring in an army
or use a bomb or something?

699
00:47:09,397 --> 00:47:10,439
Why a jump point?

700
00:47:10,523 --> 00:47:12,334
You're right.
Jump points aren't weapons,

701
00:47:12,358 --> 00:47:13,669
they're means of transportation.

702
00:47:13,693 --> 00:47:15,504
Every jump point has two sides,

703
00:47:15,528 --> 00:47:18,150
so if Tarnax's atmosphere
was siphoned away,

704
00:47:18,489 --> 00:47:20,807
- it had to go somewhere, or...
- Hala.

705
00:47:22,868 --> 00:47:23,929
The Kree Civil War

706
00:47:23,953 --> 00:47:26,556
basically bankrupted Hala
of its natural resources.

707
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:27,724
The air is barely breathable,

708
00:47:27,748 --> 00:47:28,809
they're suffering from a drought.

709
00:47:28,833 --> 00:47:29,834
A drought?

710
00:47:29,917 --> 00:47:32,044
So, she could be after water next.

711
00:47:32,128 --> 00:47:34,839
Okay. Where in the Magellanic
can we find...

712
00:47:34,922 --> 00:47:36,340
Aladna.

713
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:40,052
Oceans cover 99.63% of the planet.

714
00:47:40,136 --> 00:47:43,002
That is a very specific stat.
You've been there.

715
00:47:45,307 --> 00:47:46,350
Yeah.

716
00:47:46,434 --> 00:47:48,060
Uh... Uh, yeah.

717
00:47:50,855 --> 00:47:52,416
She said that really weird.

718
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:53,500
Yeah. Why are you being weird?

719
00:47:53,524 --> 00:47:56,318
Okay. Consensus on Aladna.

720
00:47:57,570 --> 00:48:00,114
- Aye.
- Yeah, I say we do it.

721
00:48:00,197 --> 00:48:03,135
Get to Aladna and separate
Dar-Benn from that bangle.

722
00:48:03,159 --> 00:48:04,785
We have our heading.

723
00:48:04,869 --> 00:48:05,953
Kamala,

724
00:48:06,454 --> 00:48:09,498
you are not going
on any space adventures.

725
00:48:09,582 --> 00:48:12,387
Nicholas has told me
how dangerous they can be.

726
00:48:12,418 --> 00:48:14,420
It's just "Fury." God.

727
00:48:15,296 --> 00:48:17,190
Wait. Where are you guys?
Where is Abu?

728
00:48:17,214 --> 00:48:20,634
Hell.
This man has taken us to Hell.

729
00:48:22,678 --> 00:48:24,691
Hell?
So that means I'm the devil?

730
00:48:24,764 --> 00:48:27,475
- Really, Fury?
- They insisted,

731
00:48:27,558 --> 00:48:30,162
and your dad is not adjusting
very well to space travel.

732
00:48:30,186 --> 00:48:32,789
Hey, babe, so I'm in
this crazy space elevator

733
00:48:32,813 --> 00:48:33,981
and we're going up.

734
00:48:34,065 --> 00:48:37,401
Or maybe we're going down. Uh...

735
00:48:37,485 --> 00:48:38,879
Are there directions in space?

736
00:48:38,903 --> 00:48:40,154
Yes, there are.

737
00:48:40,237 --> 00:48:41,489
But no filming.

738
00:48:41,572 --> 00:48:43,199
Oh. Okay.

739
00:48:43,908 --> 00:48:45,242
Help me.

740
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,004
Fury, everything okay?

741
00:48:57,088 --> 00:48:58,356
We've had another surge.

742
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:00,442
Reports are coming in across the network.

743
00:49:00,466 --> 00:49:02,152
It seems everyone's been affected.

744
00:49:02,176 --> 00:49:04,946
Well, we need to stop
her from making another one,

745
00:49:04,970 --> 00:49:06,490
and we can't risk
intergalactic body swapping

746
00:49:06,514 --> 00:49:07,515
in the meantime.

747
00:49:07,932 --> 00:49:09,266
Mrs. Khan, I'm sorry,

748
00:49:09,350 --> 00:49:11,036
but your daughter will have
to stay aboard my ship

749
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:12,120
until we can get to the bottom of this.

750
00:49:12,144 --> 00:49:13,771
- Oh, no, no, no.
- Yes!

751
00:49:13,854 --> 00:49:15,231
You will let her go.

752
00:49:15,314 --> 00:49:18,651
Mrs. Khan, uh, it is not that simple.

753
00:49:18,734 --> 00:49:20,319
We need Kamala.

754
00:49:20,986 --> 00:49:22,506
Ammi, we found Nani's other bangle,

755
00:49:22,530 --> 00:49:23,590
and there's this weirdly beautiful

756
00:49:23,614 --> 00:49:24,674
but kind of terrifying woman

757
00:49:24,698 --> 00:49:25,759
using the other one to hurt people.

758
00:49:25,783 --> 00:49:26,843
And we have to stop her.

759
00:49:26,867 --> 00:49:28,178
You're telling me there's another bangle.

760
00:49:28,202 --> 00:49:31,014
And they're going to use
that bangle to hurt you?

761
00:49:31,038 --> 00:49:32,182
Monica will take care of her.

762
00:49:32,206 --> 00:49:33,683
We will. And we will make sure

763
00:49:33,707 --> 00:49:35,477
she gets back home in one piece.

764
00:49:35,501 --> 00:49:36,627
I promise.

765
00:49:37,044 --> 00:49:38,337
Stay the course.

766
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:40,941
We'll figure out how to close
those jump points.

767
00:49:40,965 --> 00:49:43,509
Kamala, you listen to me.

768
00:49:43,592 --> 00:49:45,112
If anything happens to you,

769
00:49:45,136 --> 00:49:46,720
I will kill her.

770
00:49:46,804 --> 00:49:48,097
You tell her that.

771
00:49:49,765 --> 00:49:51,433
I love you, beta.

772
00:49:51,517 --> 00:49:52,518
I love you more.

773
00:49:52,601 --> 00:49:53,829
Wait, what did she just say?

774
00:49:53,853 --> 00:49:54,895
Nothing.

775
00:49:55,729 --> 00:49:58,649
Nobody cares more than Captain Marvel,

776
00:49:58,732 --> 00:50:00,252
and nobody gets more grief for it.

777
00:50:00,276 --> 00:50:03,362
Trust me. Kamala is
in good hands with Carol.

778
00:50:07,658 --> 00:50:09,305
What's wrong with that cat?

779
00:50:10,035 --> 00:50:11,579
It's acting very weird.

780
00:50:11,662 --> 00:50:14,456
Also, Mr. Fury,
she's looking little pudgy.

781
00:50:14,957 --> 00:50:16,848
I think you're overfeeding her.

782
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:19,461
Goose.

783
00:50:23,799 --> 00:50:24,800
Goose!

784
00:50:26,969 --> 00:50:28,238
Firefly? Night Light.

785
00:50:28,262 --> 00:50:30,073
Countess Marvel. Mistress Marvel?

786
00:50:30,097 --> 00:50:31,533
- Doctor Marvel?
- That's too much.

787
00:50:31,557 --> 00:50:32,808
Doctor Bright.

788
00:50:32,892 --> 00:50:35,060
Mmm... Professor Marvel.

789
00:50:35,144 --> 00:50:36,979
Nova, Supernova Girl...

790
00:50:37,062 --> 00:50:38,373
- Spectrum, Spectrum-Vision.
- You're doing too much.

791
00:50:38,397 --> 00:50:40,482
Vision! Oh, wait. No. Sorry.

792
00:50:40,566 --> 00:50:42,669
How many times do I have to
tell you guys, I do not want

793
00:50:42,693 --> 00:50:44,612
- or need a code name?
- Why?

794
00:50:44,695 --> 00:50:47,424
Besides, none of it matters
if we're not coordinated out there.

795
00:50:47,448 --> 00:50:49,705
Wanna figure out the switching thing?

796
00:50:51,118 --> 00:50:53,805
Powers stay activated
after a switch. Good to know.

797
00:50:53,829 --> 00:50:55,915
Okay, everyone together on three.

798
00:50:55,998 --> 00:50:58,250
Ready? One, two, three, go.

799
00:50:59,251 --> 00:51:01,313
Now, why would you say "go"
if we're going on three?

800
00:51:01,337 --> 00:51:02,671
I'm aware.

801
00:51:08,928 --> 00:51:09,929
Now.

802
00:51:10,512 --> 00:51:11,680
Now.

803
00:51:11,764 --> 00:51:12,765
Now.

804
00:51:13,182 --> 00:51:14,183
One, two, three!

805
00:51:16,644 --> 00:51:17,853
She gave me eyes.

806
00:51:21,273 --> 00:51:23,150
Now. Now.

807
00:51:23,234 --> 00:51:25,125
Can you hold on for one second?

808
00:51:25,236 --> 00:51:26,862
Walk. And switch!

809
00:51:29,031 --> 00:51:30,032
Switch!

810
00:51:33,786 --> 00:51:34,870
Hey, I got this!

811
00:51:42,378 --> 00:51:43,379
Yes!

812
00:51:46,465 --> 00:51:47,466
And switch!

813
00:51:48,592 --> 00:51:51,178
That's why you wanna
invest in index funds

814
00:51:51,262 --> 00:51:52,739
rather than in individual stocks.

815
00:51:52,763 --> 00:51:55,224
Of course, both a Roth IRA and 401k

816
00:51:55,307 --> 00:51:57,309
are important for tax purposes.

817
00:51:57,393 --> 00:51:59,746
You know, I never even thought
about planning for retirement.

818
00:51:59,770 --> 00:52:01,313
Hey, it's never too late.

819
00:52:01,397 --> 00:52:02,582
And it's never too early,

820
00:52:02,606 --> 00:52:03,816
like I say.

821
00:52:03,899 --> 00:52:05,526
- How old are you?
- 306.

822
00:52:05,609 --> 00:52:07,319
- Huh?
- Wow. Same age.

823
00:52:11,115 --> 00:52:12,616
Ya Allah! What was that?

824
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:14,386
- I'm gonna find out.
- Please.

825
00:52:14,410 --> 00:52:16,578
Foreign object in sector K.

826
00:52:16,662 --> 00:52:18,980
- Sweet Svartalfheim.
- Don't touch it.

827
00:52:21,250 --> 00:52:22,251
What is it?

828
00:52:22,334 --> 00:52:24,086
I haven't the foggiest idea.

829
00:52:24,169 --> 00:52:25,230
How did it get in there?

830
00:52:25,254 --> 00:52:26,297
I don't know.

831
00:52:27,965 --> 00:52:29,425
Should we tell Fury?

832
00:52:31,176 --> 00:52:32,386
Twenty seconds

833
00:52:32,469 --> 00:52:33,595
to the jump point.

834
00:52:33,679 --> 00:52:35,282
Do you guys realize
how crazy this is right now?

835
00:52:35,306 --> 00:52:37,492
Like, I'm in a spaceship
with two superheroes.

836
00:52:37,516 --> 00:52:39,077
Also, is it too late
to go to the bathroom?

837
00:52:39,101 --> 00:52:40,412
Because I feel like
it's gonna hit really soon.

838
00:52:40,436 --> 00:52:41,705
No one would believe me.
Like my...

839
00:52:41,729 --> 00:52:43,731
Nakia, she would never... Whoa!

840
00:53:38,202 --> 00:53:41,455
Okay. Here we go. Comms.

841
00:53:43,290 --> 00:53:44,476
I've always wanted one of these.

842
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:45,709
Thank you.

843
00:53:45,793 --> 00:53:47,479
Testing.
Testing, one, two, three.

844
00:53:47,503 --> 00:53:48,670
Kamala. Kamala.

845
00:53:48,754 --> 00:53:50,923
We hear you, baby. Thank you.

846
00:53:52,216 --> 00:53:55,094
So, uh, real quick
before we get sucked in...

847
00:53:55,177 --> 00:53:56,519
What the hell is that?

848
00:53:56,804 --> 00:54:00,182
I should warn you that
I'm kind of famous here.

849
00:54:00,557 --> 00:54:03,078
Well, you do know you're
famous everywhere, right?

850
00:54:03,102 --> 00:54:04,496
This one's kinda different.

851
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:06,899
I helped the prince with a legal issue.

852
00:54:06,939 --> 00:54:07,940
Okay.

853
00:54:08,023 --> 00:54:09,274
Mmm-hmm. Let's go.

854
00:54:09,358 --> 00:54:10,401
No matter what,

855
00:54:10,484 --> 00:54:11,652
follow my lead.

856
00:54:11,735 --> 00:54:13,987
Aladnean culture is very specific.

857
00:54:14,071 --> 00:54:16,549
So, there's gonna be a bit
of a ceremony we have to do,

858
00:54:16,573 --> 00:54:17,950
but just... stay cool.

859
00:54:18,033 --> 00:54:20,244
Fair Aladna

860
00:54:20,327 --> 00:54:23,330
It's a peaceful crossroads

861
00:54:23,414 --> 00:54:25,833
Diamond of the quadrant

862
00:54:25,916 --> 00:54:28,877
Aladna, our home

863
00:54:28,961 --> 00:54:30,980
Hi, small child, could you tell...

864
00:54:31,004 --> 00:54:32,673
Fair Aladna

865
00:54:33,298 --> 00:54:36,218
As if no time has passed

866
00:54:36,301 --> 00:54:39,221
So excited that you're home

867
00:54:39,930 --> 00:54:43,976
Our princess is home

868
00:54:44,059 --> 00:54:45,227
Princess?

869
00:54:50,607 --> 00:54:51,984
It's a technicality.

870
00:54:52,067 --> 00:54:53,420
Carol. What is happening?

871
00:54:53,444 --> 00:54:54,587
Their language is Song.

872
00:54:54,611 --> 00:54:56,214
Most of them won't understand
you unless you sing.

873
00:54:56,238 --> 00:54:57,281
Come on.

874
00:54:57,364 --> 00:54:59,074
Going to the banquet

875
00:54:59,158 --> 00:55:00,760
Prince Yan's at the banquet

876
00:55:00,784 --> 00:55:03,471
Going to the banquet
Prince Yan's at the banquet

877
00:55:03,495 --> 00:55:04,593
Hi. Oh, hi, hello.

878
00:55:05,289 --> 00:55:07,789
Going to the banquet Going to the banquet

879
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,644
Where's the prince?
Where's the prince?

880
00:55:09,668 --> 00:55:10,919
Hey, hey, hey

881
00:55:11,003 --> 00:55:12,522
Going, going, going, going

882
00:55:12,546 --> 00:55:14,214
Going to the banquet

883
00:55:14,298 --> 00:55:17,551
Going, going, going, going
Going to the banquet

884
00:55:20,471 --> 00:55:21,781
Why aren't you guys dancing?

885
00:55:21,805 --> 00:55:22,848
I am dancing.

886
00:55:23,724 --> 00:55:25,142
Dancing is life

887
00:55:25,225 --> 00:55:26,727
Oh, we're almost there.

888
00:55:28,645 --> 00:55:31,565
How angelic.
Hi... Okay. All right.

889
00:55:36,528 --> 00:55:39,455
Oh, my gosh, give me
some of what they're having.

890
00:55:39,823 --> 00:55:41,718
- If you tell anyone about...
- What?

891
00:55:41,742 --> 00:55:44,060
That you're a pretty, pretty princess?

892
00:55:44,578 --> 00:55:45,889
So, that's what you meant

893
00:55:45,913 --> 00:55:48,081
when you said "legal issue."

894
00:55:48,165 --> 00:55:49,559
Mmm. It is a marriage of convenience.

895
00:55:49,583 --> 00:55:51,269
It's more of a diplomatic act, you know?

896
00:55:51,293 --> 00:55:54,189
It's like, there was a power struggle.
Matriarchal society.

897
00:55:54,213 --> 00:55:55,881
- We are friends.
- Mmm-hmm.

898
00:55:55,964 --> 00:55:57,090
It's a long story.

899
00:55:57,508 --> 00:55:58,972
Maybe you could sing it.

900
00:55:59,551 --> 00:56:01,178
Maybe not.

901
00:56:01,261 --> 00:56:02,262
Mmm, we're here.

902
00:56:08,519 --> 00:56:10,062
Damn.

903
00:56:10,145 --> 00:56:11,438
You saw them arrive

904
00:56:11,522 --> 00:56:12,564
Oh, hello

905
00:56:13,273 --> 00:56:15,895
Well, okay, I see why
you like to come here.

906
00:56:18,904 --> 00:56:24,076
- Attention
- Yes

907
00:56:24,159 --> 00:56:26,662
A pleasure to announce

908
00:56:26,745 --> 00:56:29,498
To this lovely roomful

909
00:56:29,581 --> 00:56:31,792
Two new faces

910
00:56:34,002 --> 00:56:37,005
One could be more cheerful

911
00:56:39,508 --> 00:56:42,553
But nonetheless we ring the bells

912
00:56:42,636 --> 00:56:46,807
To usher in, who, pray tell?

913
00:56:47,307 --> 00:56:48,684
None other than

914
00:56:48,767 --> 00:56:51,853
One, two, three

915
00:56:52,312 --> 00:56:58,318
The Marvels!

916
00:56:58,402 --> 00:56:59,403
The Marvels

917
00:56:59,486 --> 00:57:00,487
The Marvels?

918
00:57:00,571 --> 00:57:01,572
Yes!

919
00:57:01,655 --> 00:57:03,383
How... How is that
even a thing already?

920
00:57:03,407 --> 00:57:06,029
- Okay, let's be cool.
- Where's the prince?

921
00:57:18,422 --> 00:57:19,423
That's...

922
00:57:20,549 --> 00:57:21,550
What the hell?

923
00:57:26,888 --> 00:57:27,949
What is she doing?

924
00:57:27,973 --> 00:57:29,803
Oh, she's respecting the flow.

925
00:57:36,648 --> 00:57:39,484
How long

926
00:57:40,193 --> 00:57:42,738
Do I have with
my dance partner this time?

927
00:57:42,821 --> 00:57:44,865
Yan... We are all in...

928
00:57:44,948 --> 00:57:46,009
- What is happening?
- What?

929
00:57:46,033 --> 00:57:47,367
Danger

930
00:57:47,451 --> 00:57:50,162
- The Captain needs our help
- Help!

931
00:57:50,245 --> 00:57:51,306
Dar-Benn is coming

932
00:57:51,330 --> 00:57:53,709
I'm feeling so many feelings right now.

933
00:57:54,124 --> 00:57:55,954
Oh, Aladna's not afraid of her

934
00:57:56,001 --> 00:57:59,004
Invite her down
put her feet on the ground

935
00:57:59,087 --> 00:58:01,882
Give me a chance here
before it gets too messy

936
00:58:01,965 --> 00:58:05,052
So lead the wolf inside our walls

937
00:58:05,135 --> 00:58:07,095
And trust that you alone

938
00:58:07,179 --> 00:58:09,824
- Can stop an army?
- Have I ever let you down?

939
00:58:09,848 --> 00:58:12,118
How many chapters of your Captain Marvel
fan fiction is this giving you?

940
00:58:12,142 --> 00:58:13,411
I'm not about to start

941
00:58:13,435 --> 00:58:14,436
So many.

942
00:58:14,561 --> 00:58:15,562
And don't forget

943
00:58:15,646 --> 00:58:17,272
Don't forget

944
00:58:18,899 --> 00:58:21,985
I'm not alone

945
00:58:25,572 --> 00:58:26,573
Monica.

946
00:58:30,869 --> 00:58:35,582
My Princess from the star...

947
00:58:35,666 --> 00:58:38,645
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Stop.
Please stop. We need to talk.

948
00:58:38,669 --> 00:58:40,104
- Okay, let's talk.
- Okay.

949
00:58:40,128 --> 00:58:42,106
Oh, wait.
He doesn't have to sing?

950
00:58:42,130 --> 00:58:43,411
Yeah, he's bilingual.

951
00:58:43,799 --> 00:58:45,276
We are severely underdressed.

952
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:48,279
But could you get us something
a little more battle-ready?

953
00:58:48,303 --> 00:58:49,680
Of course.

954
00:58:50,013 --> 00:58:51,014
Thank you.

955
00:58:54,893 --> 00:58:56,353
Theories so far?

956
00:58:56,436 --> 00:58:58,388
At best, a one-off pest problem.

957
00:58:59,648 --> 00:59:02,234
At worst, an enemy plant.

958
00:59:02,317 --> 00:59:04,569
Some kinda infestation bioweapon.

959
00:59:04,653 --> 00:59:07,131
Or it could be from a traitor from within.

960
00:59:07,155 --> 00:59:11,868
Well, let's not go there yet.
This egg you say...

961
00:59:11,952 --> 00:59:13,888
let's just continue to study it,

962
00:59:13,912 --> 00:59:15,372
and if anything...

963
00:59:15,455 --> 00:59:16,540
Warning.

964
00:59:16,623 --> 00:59:18,792
Twenty-nine new objects detected.

965
00:59:22,170 --> 00:59:23,171
Oh, my God.

966
00:59:26,049 --> 00:59:27,718
What about Lady of Light?

967
00:59:27,801 --> 00:59:29,428
- Ooh. Frequency.
- No.

968
00:59:29,511 --> 00:59:30,512
- Pulsar.
- No.

969
00:59:30,595 --> 00:59:31,888
Pulsar Light Lady.

970
00:59:31,972 --> 00:59:34,158
Absolutely not. These...
These are too much, right?

971
00:59:34,182 --> 00:59:35,280
- Definitely.
- No.

972
00:59:45,652 --> 00:59:47,797
We make this quick.
Nothing grandiose.

973
00:59:47,821 --> 00:59:50,449
You three need to disappear.
But stay close.

974
00:59:50,532 --> 00:59:51,533
My specialty.

975
00:59:58,707 --> 00:59:59,927
This will work, Yan.

976
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:03,020
Remember, we wanna keep

977
01:00:03,044 --> 01:00:05,273
unintentional switching to a minimum.

978
01:00:05,297 --> 01:00:07,525
Entertain her as long as you possibly can.

979
01:00:07,549 --> 01:00:09,193
Monica and I will get the jump on her.

980
01:00:09,217 --> 01:00:10,742
And we'll get the bangle.

981
01:00:13,930 --> 01:00:15,056
It's time.

982
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:19,704
Supremor, why have you come?

983
01:01:19,788 --> 01:01:22,082
I've come here to pardon you

984
01:01:22,165 --> 01:01:24,605
for your crimes against the Kree Empire.

985
01:01:25,210 --> 01:01:26,294
Kneel.

986
01:01:26,711 --> 01:01:27,712
To you?

987
01:01:29,923 --> 01:01:32,175
- I will never kneel.
- Okay.

988
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:01,746
Damn it!

989
01:02:25,270 --> 01:02:26,271
Use your scarf.

990
01:02:44,623 --> 01:02:45,624
Go!

991
01:02:54,716 --> 01:02:55,884
I found her.

992
01:03:12,609 --> 01:03:14,069
Monica, where are you?

993
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:21,701
Monica, tag me in.

994
01:03:21,785 --> 01:03:23,119
One, two...

995
01:03:24,037 --> 01:03:25,038
Don't do this.

996
01:03:25,121 --> 01:03:26,539
You're too late.

997
01:04:05,620 --> 01:04:07,023
Where did you get that?

998
01:04:07,497 --> 01:04:09,997
My grandma,
she sent it to me in the mail.

999
01:04:11,584 --> 01:04:13,628
- Give it to me.
- Kamala, run.

1000
01:04:14,337 --> 01:04:15,338
Get to the ship.

1001
01:04:29,519 --> 01:04:32,202
With this,
your powers only make me stronger.

1002
01:04:56,212 --> 01:04:57,273
The surges are frying our systems.

1003
01:04:57,297 --> 01:04:58,941
Are we doing something about these?

1004
01:04:58,965 --> 01:05:00,234
The space elevator's offline.

1005
01:05:00,258 --> 01:05:02,515
You ever come in here with good news?

1006
01:05:03,094 --> 01:05:04,864
Half the evacuation pods just went down.

1007
01:05:04,888 --> 01:05:07,015
That's not good news.

1008
01:05:40,799 --> 01:05:41,883
Are you guys in?

1009
01:05:41,966 --> 01:05:43,009
In.

1010
01:05:44,719 --> 01:05:46,596
Redirect all fighters.

1011
01:05:57,857 --> 01:05:59,567
Disengaging autopilot.

1012
01:06:05,448 --> 01:06:07,888
Oh, my God.
Okay, here we go. Here we go.

1013
01:06:11,621 --> 01:06:12,622
Monica?

1014
01:06:14,791 --> 01:06:16,804
Monica, we're going down, Monica!

1015
01:06:20,004 --> 01:06:21,440
I thought you could drive this thing!

1016
01:06:21,464 --> 01:06:22,745
Carol! Get down here.

1017
01:06:23,007 --> 01:06:24,105
Hold that thought.

1018
01:06:24,175 --> 01:06:25,822
Can you believe this woman?

1019
01:06:31,808 --> 01:06:33,893
O, Captain! My Captain!

1020
01:06:42,569 --> 01:06:44,863
- No, no, no, no!
- Move over.

1021
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:55,766
I'm activating a jump point.

1022
01:06:55,790 --> 01:06:56,851
No, I can lose her.

1023
01:06:56,875 --> 01:06:58,269
And what about the other 20 ships?

1024
01:06:58,293 --> 01:06:59,294
I can do this.

1025
01:07:05,133 --> 01:07:06,217
Missile lock.

1026
01:07:06,301 --> 01:07:08,219
- Guys?
- Missile lock.

1027
01:07:18,104 --> 01:07:19,772
Incoming missiles.

1028
01:07:19,856 --> 01:07:21,584
- Impact in five...
- We need to leave now.

1029
01:07:21,608 --> 01:07:22,668
I can't let this happen again.

1030
01:07:22,692 --> 01:07:23,752
- It already has.
- ...four, three, two...

1031
01:07:23,776 --> 01:07:24,777
I can do this.

1032
01:07:24,861 --> 01:07:26,172
And you'll kill us trying.

1033
01:07:26,196 --> 01:07:27,614
Jump point activated.

1034
01:07:47,884 --> 01:07:49,904
We left Aladna to fend for themselves.

1035
01:07:49,928 --> 01:07:51,447
Dar-Benn was gonna get my bangle.

1036
01:07:51,471 --> 01:07:53,741
So I made a tough call
like you did on Tarnax.

1037
01:07:53,765 --> 01:07:55,117
Don't try to be like me.

1038
01:07:55,141 --> 01:07:56,785
I messed this whole thing up.

1039
01:07:56,809 --> 01:07:57,912
If we weren't entangled,

1040
01:07:57,936 --> 01:07:59,997
if we weren't here, then
you could have beat Dar-Benn.

1041
01:08:00,021 --> 01:08:01,147
And I'm sorry.

1042
01:08:03,441 --> 01:08:05,860
No, you don't understand.

1043
01:08:05,944 --> 01:08:09,572
The Kree had been ruled
by an AI for a millennia

1044
01:08:09,656 --> 01:08:11,091
that led them into a war.

1045
01:08:11,115 --> 01:08:14,469
And I thought the only way
to stop it was to destroy it.

1046
01:08:15,411 --> 01:08:16,454
But I just

1047
01:08:17,330 --> 01:08:18,665
made it worse.

1048
01:08:20,208 --> 01:08:21,268
I'm the reason why

1049
01:08:21,292 --> 01:08:22,853
the civil war started in the first place.

1050
01:08:22,877 --> 01:08:25,804
I'm the reason why
they couldn't breathe the air.

1051
01:08:26,339 --> 01:08:28,657
That's how I got the name Annihilator.

1052
01:08:30,051 --> 01:08:33,012
And I never wanted you to see
that version of me.

1053
01:08:36,224 --> 01:08:38,476
Is that why you never came back?

1054
01:08:39,060 --> 01:08:40,524
I thought if I fixed it,

1055
01:08:41,187 --> 01:08:42,855
then I could come home.

1056
01:08:43,648 --> 01:08:44,732
Carol.

1057
01:08:46,067 --> 01:08:48,861
That's not how family works.

1058
01:08:50,530 --> 01:08:54,242
I never expected you to be
the mighty Captain Marvel.

1059
01:08:55,994 --> 01:08:57,537
I just wanted you.

1060
01:08:59,330 --> 01:09:00,665
My aunt.

1061
01:09:06,337 --> 01:09:08,594
I'm really glad that you're here now.

1062
01:09:15,179 --> 01:09:16,681
And you, too.

1063
01:09:17,724 --> 01:09:19,309
I'm glad to be here.

1064
01:09:20,101 --> 01:09:21,620
I hope that goes without saying.

1065
01:09:21,644 --> 01:09:24,022
And I am sorry

1066
01:09:24,105 --> 01:09:26,292
for coming on too strong at the beginning.

1067
01:09:26,316 --> 01:09:29,548
I did not give you a lot of space
to be a real person.

1068
01:09:33,448 --> 01:09:34,824
We have to find her.

1069
01:09:34,907 --> 01:09:36,593
I mean, but she could be anywhere.

1070
01:09:36,617 --> 01:09:38,953
No, not anywhere.

1071
01:09:40,163 --> 01:09:42,141
She's targeting the people
that I care about

1072
01:09:42,165 --> 01:09:45,275
and stealing resources
from every place I call home.

1073
01:09:45,668 --> 01:09:47,170
We have to warn Fury.

1074
01:09:54,010 --> 01:09:55,720
This is an emergency.

1075
01:09:55,803 --> 01:09:57,740
All S.A.B.E.R. personnel must report

1076
01:09:57,764 --> 01:10:00,058
to an evacuation pod immediately.

1077
01:10:00,141 --> 01:10:01,225
Walk. Do not run.

1078
01:10:01,309 --> 01:10:02,953
We only have one evacuation bay online.

1079
01:10:02,977 --> 01:10:04,204
Which means that all we have left

1080
01:10:04,228 --> 01:10:06,665
to evacuate 350 personnel
are 15 escape pods

1081
01:10:06,689 --> 01:10:08,208
which seat five, 10, if we squeeze.

1082
01:10:08,232 --> 01:10:10,127
- It's nowhere near enough.
- Well, fill the remaining ones

1083
01:10:10,151 --> 01:10:11,628
with as many people as you can,

1084
01:10:11,652 --> 01:10:13,005
then come up with a Plan B.

1085
01:10:13,029 --> 01:10:14,131
This is an emergency.

1086
01:10:14,155 --> 01:10:15,156
All S.A.B.E.R...

1087
01:10:24,791 --> 01:10:26,542
No, no, no.

1088
01:10:27,460 --> 01:10:29,960
- Aamir. Go help them.
- Okay, okay. Okay.

1089
01:10:31,756 --> 01:10:33,383
I got this.

1090
01:10:36,886 --> 01:10:39,055
My living room.

1091
01:10:39,472 --> 01:10:41,057
Goose?

1092
01:10:52,568 --> 01:10:54,946
Goose, how'd you...

1093
01:10:55,696 --> 01:10:58,533
Come here. Come. Come on.

1094
01:10:58,616 --> 01:11:01,369
Yes. Yes. Come here. Look at you.

1095
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:04,080
Oh. Look!

1096
01:11:04,664 --> 01:11:06,128
Oh, no, not my good eye!

1097
01:11:07,875 --> 01:11:09,888
We only have one escape pod left.

1098
01:11:10,169 --> 01:11:11,170
We're doomed.

1099
01:11:12,839 --> 01:11:14,257
In the end,

1100
01:11:14,674 --> 01:11:17,611
none of us choose how
we transition from this life

1101
01:11:17,635 --> 01:11:18,928
to the next.

1102
01:11:19,011 --> 01:11:20,805
What? No!

1103
01:11:20,888 --> 01:11:23,516
Get everyone
to the evacuation deck. Now!

1104
01:11:30,648 --> 01:11:32,501
Here, kitty.
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

1105
01:11:32,525 --> 01:11:34,235
What are we doing?

1106
01:11:35,403 --> 01:11:36,505
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

1107
01:11:36,529 --> 01:11:38,176
Let's go. Come on. Come on.

1108
01:11:38,448 --> 01:11:40,575
- I can't. Can you?
- I got it.

1109
01:11:43,536 --> 01:11:45,288
What is going on, fam?

1110
01:11:45,788 --> 01:11:46,789
Kamala?

1111
01:11:47,373 --> 01:11:48,916
Kamala! Yusuf, Kamala!

1112
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,794
- Ya Allah.
- Kamala! Kamala!

1113
01:11:53,504 --> 01:11:54,898
You're back safely, beta.

1114
01:11:54,922 --> 01:11:56,132
You're not dead.

1115
01:11:56,215 --> 01:11:58,134
I've lost contact with Earth.

1116
01:11:58,217 --> 01:12:00,596
We're officially at abandon-ship phase.

1117
01:12:05,057 --> 01:12:06,142
Spit him out.

1118
01:12:06,225 --> 01:12:07,578
- Spit him out.
- No, no, no.

1119
01:12:07,602 --> 01:12:09,145
No. That's the plan.

1120
01:12:10,438 --> 01:12:11,874
- That's the plan?
- It's much easier

1121
01:12:11,898 --> 01:12:15,496
to transport a family of cats
than hundreds of crew members.

1122
01:12:15,985 --> 01:12:17,998
So, we're literally herding cats?

1123
01:12:22,033 --> 01:12:23,070
Come here, kitty.

1124
01:12:24,327 --> 01:12:26,120
Attention, S.A.B.E.R. crew.

1125
01:12:26,204 --> 01:12:29,123
Stop running and let the Flerkens eat you.

1126
01:12:29,207 --> 01:12:31,626
You will be fine.

1127
01:12:42,011 --> 01:12:43,012
S.A.B.E.R. crew.

1128
01:12:43,095 --> 01:12:46,057
Stop running and let the Flerkens eat you.

1129
01:12:47,225 --> 01:12:48,643
Stop running.

1130
01:13:03,199 --> 01:13:04,450
I'm sorry.

1131
01:13:09,956 --> 01:13:12,392
Stop running
and let the Flerkens eat you.

1132
01:13:12,416 --> 01:13:14,794
Stop running.

1133
01:13:35,439 --> 01:13:37,108
Guys, I found her.

1134
01:13:38,276 --> 01:13:40,546
- Come on. Come on, move.
- Hey! Come on.

1135
01:13:40,570 --> 01:13:41,729
Come on, come here.

1136
01:13:43,364 --> 01:13:45,491
- Go, go, go.
- Come on, come on.

1137
01:13:45,575 --> 01:13:47,844
- Go to the spacecraft bay.
- Okay. Come on. Chalo, Chalo.

1138
01:13:47,868 --> 01:13:50,003
Come on.
Yusuf, stop with your belt.

1139
01:14:04,051 --> 01:14:07,013
Nope. No. No, no, no.
Thank you. No.

1140
01:14:08,014 --> 01:14:09,432
Come, come, come.

1141
01:14:17,148 --> 01:14:18,250
Don't you worry, little one.

1142
01:14:18,274 --> 01:14:20,693
Here, go to Kamala. Go to Kamala.

1143
01:14:23,821 --> 01:14:25,257
There you go, come, come.

1144
01:14:25,281 --> 01:14:27,116
- I found Dar-Benn.
- What?

1145
01:14:28,034 --> 01:14:29,285
She wants our sun.

1146
01:14:56,896 --> 01:14:57,994
You leavin' again?

1147
01:14:58,814 --> 01:14:59,899
Yeah.

1148
01:15:00,441 --> 01:15:02,044
Ammi, the universe isn't safe.

1149
01:15:02,068 --> 01:15:03,211
And if the universe isn't safe,

1150
01:15:03,235 --> 01:15:04,296
that means you guys aren't safe.

1151
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:05,797
And if you guys aren't...

1152
01:15:05,821 --> 01:15:07,448
Listen to me.

1153
01:15:08,157 --> 01:15:11,827
You are chosen
for a greater purpose, okay?

1154
01:15:11,911 --> 01:15:13,871
So, of course you must go now.

1155
01:15:15,164 --> 01:15:17,583
But I will never let you go.

1156
01:15:18,376 --> 01:15:20,169
You understand that, right?

1157
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:26,693
- Yeah.
- Come back safely, beta.

1158
01:15:26,717 --> 01:15:29,595
You better. I don't
wanna be an only child.

1159
01:15:29,679 --> 01:15:31,972
Not again. Not with these two.

1160
01:15:35,434 --> 01:15:38,538
You think it's wise taking
that bangle to the bad guy?

1161
01:15:38,562 --> 01:15:39,873
Yes. Mr. Fury's right. Give it to me.

1162
01:15:39,897 --> 01:15:41,117
I will take it home.

1163
01:15:41,816 --> 01:15:43,043
Dar-Benn's opened another jump point,

1164
01:15:43,067 --> 01:15:45,295
and we're gonna need
both bangles to close it.

1165
01:15:45,319 --> 01:15:46,963
Then I guess you'd better make damn sure

1166
01:15:46,987 --> 01:15:48,939
she doesn't get her hands on it.

1167
01:15:49,365 --> 01:15:50,491
Understood.

1168
01:16:08,926 --> 01:16:10,136
Oh, God, Mr. Fury,

1169
01:16:10,219 --> 01:16:11,905
you are going in the wrong direction!

1170
01:16:11,929 --> 01:16:13,347
Mrs. Khan, I know!

1171
01:16:16,767 --> 01:16:19,572
- You did it, Mr. Fury!
- I didn't do anything.

1172
01:16:23,232 --> 01:16:24,358
Are you praying?

1173
01:16:25,317 --> 01:16:27,939
Don't stop! We need
all the help we can get!

1174
01:16:28,696 --> 01:16:29,697
Amen!

1175
01:16:30,823 --> 01:16:32,032
Amen!

1176
01:16:32,116 --> 01:16:33,492
Holy cow!

1177
01:16:33,576 --> 01:16:35,828
- Mr. Fury!
- Whoa!

1178
01:17:28,422 --> 01:17:29,548
There she is,

1179
01:17:30,633 --> 01:17:32,343
the Annihilator herself.

1180
01:17:32,426 --> 01:17:33,886
It's over, Dar-Benn.

1181
01:17:34,261 --> 01:17:35,513
No, not yet.

1182
01:17:35,596 --> 01:17:38,584
I know that you would do
anything to protect Hala.

1183
01:17:38,808 --> 01:17:40,535
This will be the end of the Kree.

1184
01:17:40,559 --> 01:17:42,162
It will be the end of everything.

1185
01:17:42,186 --> 01:17:45,481
You took from me.
I'm simply repaying the favor.

1186
01:17:46,482 --> 01:17:49,568
Now, give me the band.

1187
01:17:50,778 --> 01:17:52,047
You're forgetting something.

1188
01:17:52,071 --> 01:17:53,906
- What?
- Me.

1189
01:18:08,295 --> 01:18:11,298
This could have been so much easier.

1190
01:18:11,966 --> 01:18:14,552
I don't know. I like our odds.

1191
01:19:35,257 --> 01:19:37,551
You're living up to your name again.

1192
01:19:38,677 --> 01:19:40,095
I didn't want this.

1193
01:19:40,179 --> 01:19:41,972
Death seems to follow you.

1194
01:19:49,146 --> 01:19:50,957
It doesn't have to end
like this, Dar-Benn.

1195
01:19:50,981 --> 01:19:52,292
Please, just give us the bangle.

1196
01:19:52,316 --> 01:19:53,317
I won't!

1197
01:19:55,277 --> 01:19:57,696
Hala's sun died because of you.

1198
01:19:57,780 --> 01:19:59,427
Why shouldn't you repay us?

1199
01:20:01,533 --> 01:20:02,576
Maybe she should.

1200
01:20:04,453 --> 01:20:07,039
The reaction in your
sun's core has slowed.

1201
01:20:07,122 --> 01:20:09,559
It needs an incredible amount
of energy to jump-start it,

1202
01:20:09,583 --> 01:20:11,535
and that's what you have, Carol.

1203
01:20:12,419 --> 01:20:15,339
You can use your powers to save Hala.

1204
01:20:16,799 --> 01:20:18,902
But I've never done anything
like that before.

1205
01:20:18,926 --> 01:20:20,070
In the last couple of days, I have done

1206
01:20:20,094 --> 01:20:22,594
a lot of things I have never done before.

1207
01:20:23,639 --> 01:20:24,848
You got this.

1208
01:20:30,562 --> 01:20:31,730
For Hala.

1209
01:20:36,527 --> 01:20:37,903
For Hala.

1210
01:20:55,796 --> 01:20:59,150
Try anything and I'll kill her
faster than you can move.

1211
01:21:01,218 --> 01:21:03,470
Carol!

1212
01:21:07,808 --> 01:21:08,809
No!

1213
01:21:23,991 --> 01:21:25,301
You won't survive this.

1214
01:21:25,325 --> 01:21:27,911
Dar-Benn, listen to me.

1215
01:22:12,039 --> 01:22:13,165
Are you okay?

1216
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:15,501
Yeah.

1217
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:18,420
I didn't switch.

1218
01:22:18,921 --> 01:22:19,922
One, two, three.

1219
01:22:45,656 --> 01:22:47,616
I'm so glad you're okay.

1220
01:22:48,534 --> 01:22:49,754
You got the bangles.

1221
01:22:52,079 --> 01:22:54,164
We're gonna need those.

1222
01:22:56,416 --> 01:22:58,627
Okay, come on, Princess.

1223
01:23:04,216 --> 01:23:06,135
So, what are we looking at?

1224
01:23:06,218 --> 01:23:09,072
A self-propagating singularity
with negative mass

1225
01:23:09,096 --> 01:23:10,743
and non-Newtonian topology.

1226
01:23:12,599 --> 01:23:15,602
She tore a hole in space-time.

1227
01:23:18,188 --> 01:23:21,608
That is a different reality
bleeding into ours.

1228
01:23:22,067 --> 01:23:23,348
Can we even fix that?

1229
01:23:23,402 --> 01:23:25,154
In theory, you and Carol

1230
01:23:25,237 --> 01:23:26,840
can reproduce the same amount of energy

1231
01:23:26,864 --> 01:23:27,966
that was used to open it.

1232
01:23:27,990 --> 01:23:29,884
I will absorb it and then release it,

1233
01:23:29,908 --> 01:23:31,386
but from inside the tear.

1234
01:23:31,410 --> 01:23:33,096
But what about the switching?

1235
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:35,622
Our, um, powers aren't entangled anymore.

1236
01:23:39,084 --> 01:23:41,503
Well, that's a good thing, I guess.

1237
01:23:41,962 --> 01:23:44,506
But, wait. You want us to blast you

1238
01:23:44,590 --> 01:23:46,067
with the same amount of power

1239
01:23:46,091 --> 01:23:48,957
that punched a hole
in the fabric of space-time?

1240
01:23:49,595 --> 01:23:51,972
If we wanna un-punch it, yeah.

1241
01:23:53,098 --> 01:23:54,099
Monica...

1242
01:23:55,767 --> 01:23:57,170
You're gonna need this.

1243
01:24:05,444 --> 01:24:07,396
How are you feeling, Ms. Marvel?

1244
01:24:08,197 --> 01:24:10,925
These bangles traveled
through space and time.

1245
01:24:10,949 --> 01:24:12,242
To find me.

1246
01:24:14,411 --> 01:24:15,662
I was born for this.

1247
01:24:19,875 --> 01:24:21,418
It has to be now.

1248
01:24:24,796 --> 01:24:26,298
Bismillaah.

1249
01:25:03,794 --> 01:25:05,337
Your mom would be proud.

1250
01:25:06,255 --> 01:25:07,881
Higher, further, faster.

1251
01:25:10,133 --> 01:25:12,135
Higher, further, faster.

1252
01:26:09,776 --> 01:26:11,921
It's closing, Monica.
You've got to get out of there.

1253
01:26:11,945 --> 01:26:14,614
I can't leave, Carol.

1254
01:26:14,698 --> 01:26:16,101
What? What do you mean?

1255
01:26:16,158 --> 01:26:17,326
I can't leave.

1256
01:26:17,409 --> 01:26:18,845
I have to finish the job.

1257
01:26:18,869 --> 01:26:21,347
No! Monica, it's closing.
You'll be trapped!

1258
01:26:21,371 --> 01:26:22,497
It's okay.

1259
01:26:40,057 --> 01:26:41,308
Come on.

1260
01:26:45,103 --> 01:26:47,116
Always knew I would have to stay.

1261
01:27:55,132 --> 01:27:56,925
Ka... Kamala. Beta.

1262
01:28:02,639 --> 01:28:04,433
Kamala, you saved the world.

1263
01:28:09,688 --> 01:28:11,398
- Why are you crying?
- Beta?

1264
01:28:11,481 --> 01:28:12,732
Why are you crying?

1265
01:28:17,237 --> 01:28:18,405
What happened?

1266
01:28:19,739 --> 01:28:21,283
We lost Monica.

1267
01:28:24,536 --> 01:28:26,788
She got stuck on the other side.

1268
01:28:27,539 --> 01:28:28,707
And Carol?

1269
01:28:32,252 --> 01:28:34,087
She went to fulfill a promise.

1270
01:29:58,755 --> 01:29:59,965
How are things?

1271
01:30:00,382 --> 01:30:03,309
The planets are expected
to make a full recovery.

1272
01:30:03,343 --> 01:30:05,071
And a team of scientists
are being sent to Hala

1273
01:30:05,095 --> 01:30:06,280
to try and help their people.

1274
01:30:06,304 --> 01:30:07,847
That's not what I meant.

1275
01:30:31,246 --> 01:30:32,306
This says "Kitchen,"

1276
01:30:32,330 --> 01:30:34,600
but there are all these
hot sauce packets...

1277
01:30:34,624 --> 01:30:37,794
And then there's this
very bizarre-looking tray,

1278
01:30:37,877 --> 01:30:40,880
which I will say is
a very good quality, though.

1279
01:30:40,964 --> 01:30:43,109
- Oof. You can keep it.
- Oh, no, no, Carol, I just...

1280
01:30:43,133 --> 01:30:44,193
Where else would they go?

1281
01:30:44,217 --> 01:30:46,094
Oh, yeah, yeah, it was for me.

1282
01:30:46,177 --> 01:30:48,155
The vastness of it just gives you

1283
01:30:48,179 --> 01:30:50,432
a whole new perspective on life.

1284
01:30:50,515 --> 01:30:52,350
Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

1285
01:30:52,434 --> 01:30:54,203
And it was surprisingly cool.

1286
01:30:56,855 --> 01:30:59,691
This place is amazing.

1287
01:30:59,774 --> 01:31:01,359
Yeah, it is.

1288
01:31:02,986 --> 01:31:04,999
Hey, do you still fly that thing?

1289
01:31:05,071 --> 01:31:06,382
- You wanna check it out?
- I do.

1290
01:31:06,406 --> 01:31:07,449
All right.

1291
01:31:07,532 --> 01:31:08,718
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

1292
01:31:08,742 --> 01:31:10,845
Come here. Come here.
Come here. Come here.

1293
01:31:10,869 --> 01:31:13,997
Oh, I'm so happy that
you're home safe, beta.

1294
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:15,081
Okay.

1295
01:31:20,962 --> 01:31:21,963
Aamir,

1296
01:31:22,964 --> 01:31:24,150
this would be a lovely house

1297
01:31:24,174 --> 01:31:26,065
to raise a family in, you know?

1298
01:31:27,469 --> 01:31:28,637
Aamir.

1299
01:31:28,720 --> 01:31:30,764
This is so cool.

1300
01:31:30,847 --> 01:31:32,349
Pilot seat's all you.

1301
01:31:41,858 --> 01:31:43,193
Let's fly this thing.

1302
01:31:43,693 --> 01:31:45,612
I actually don't have the key.

1303
01:31:45,695 --> 01:31:47,530
I'm just looking after it.

1304
01:31:49,574 --> 01:31:51,282
Just until Monica gets back?

1305
01:31:52,118 --> 01:31:53,286
Yeah.

1306
01:31:54,746 --> 01:31:56,748
Just until Monica gets back.

1307
01:31:57,290 --> 01:31:58,833
I really miss her.

1308
01:31:59,459 --> 01:32:01,544
We were good together.

1309
01:32:01,628 --> 01:32:03,588
Which got me thinking...

1310
01:32:15,725 --> 01:32:18,520
Pizza delivery.

1311
01:32:22,065 --> 01:32:23,191
Okay.

1312
01:32:29,447 --> 01:32:31,074
Can I help you?

1313
01:32:31,157 --> 01:32:32,534
Kate Bishop.

1314
01:32:35,870 --> 01:32:39,285
Did you think you're the only
kid superhero in the world?

1315
01:32:39,708 --> 01:32:41,416
- Well, I'm 23.
- Oh, I know.

1316
01:32:42,335 --> 01:32:44,043
I've been reading up on you.

1317
01:32:44,546 --> 01:32:45,606
Where did you get that?

1318
01:32:45,630 --> 01:32:47,132
I found it in my couch.

1319
01:32:47,507 --> 01:32:48,508
Okay.

1320
01:32:48,591 --> 01:32:51,579
You've just become part
of a much larger universe.

1321
01:32:52,137 --> 01:32:55,849
Which, at the moment, is just me, mostly.

1322
01:32:55,932 --> 01:32:56,992
I do have feelers out, though.

1323
01:32:57,016 --> 01:32:58,077
Did you know Ant-Man had a daughter?

1324
01:32:58,101 --> 01:32:59,138
What do you want?

1325
01:32:59,185 --> 01:33:00,893
I'm putting together a team.

1326
01:33:01,479 --> 01:33:02,760
And I want you on it.

1327
01:33:08,778 --> 01:33:09,779
Please?

1328
01:36:16,758 --> 01:36:17,926
Mom?

1329
01:36:21,179 --> 01:36:22,513
Mom?

1330
01:36:24,182 --> 01:36:26,017
- Mom!
- "Mom"?

1331
01:36:26,100 --> 01:36:28,102
I've missed you so much!

1332
01:36:28,186 --> 01:36:29,437
You missed me?

1333
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:32,207
- I'm so sorry. I'm... I'm...
- Okay. Okay. Okay, okay.

1334
01:36:32,231 --> 01:36:33,375
Hey, hey, look at me.

1335
01:36:33,399 --> 01:36:34,817
It's okay. You're okay.

1336
01:36:34,901 --> 01:36:36,611
Hey.

1337
01:36:36,694 --> 01:36:38,905
How's our mysterious visitor?

1338
01:36:38,988 --> 01:36:41,240
She seems a little disoriented.

1339
01:36:41,324 --> 01:36:43,952
Where... Where are we? What happened?

1340
01:36:44,035 --> 01:36:46,245
We were hoping you could tell us.

1341
01:36:47,163 --> 01:36:49,582
All we know is that Binary found you.

1342
01:36:49,666 --> 01:36:54,003
My theory? You somehow crossed
through a tear in space-time.

1343
01:36:54,087 --> 01:36:56,831
You are now in a reality
parallel to your own.

1344
01:36:57,548 --> 01:37:00,051
Which is, of course, impossible.

1345
01:37:02,971 --> 01:37:05,574
I think there might be
a little confusion happening.

1346
01:37:05,598 --> 01:37:07,517
Confusion is but the first step

1347
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:08,911
on the journey to knowledge.

1348
01:37:08,935 --> 01:37:11,521
Okay. I'll take it from here.

1349
01:37:11,604 --> 01:37:13,898
Charles asked for an update.

1350
01:37:15,358 --> 01:37:17,554
I'll come by and check on you later.

1351
01:37:28,329 --> 01:37:29,622
Who are you?

1352
01:37:30,999 --> 01:37:32,959
Oh, shit.
