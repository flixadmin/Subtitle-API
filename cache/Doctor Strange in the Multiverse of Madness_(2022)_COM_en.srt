<i>SAM RAIMI. Hello, Marvel fans.
My name is Sam Raimi,</i>

2
00:00:07,466 --> 00:00:10,219
<i>and I am the director of the movie
you're about to see,</i>

3
00:00:10,303 --> 00:00:13,014
Doctor Strange
in the Multiverse of Madness.

4
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:16,267
<i>Today, is April 12th, 2022,</i>

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,979
<i>and I'm joined by our producer
and our writer.</i>

6
00:00:20,062 --> 00:00:23,232
<i>- Let me introduce to you Richie Palmer.</i>
- RICHIE PALMER: <i>Hello.</i>

7
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:25,735
RAIMI: <i>And Michael Waldron.</i>
MICHAEL WALDRON: <i>Hello.</i>

8
00:00:31,741 --> 00:00:33,704
RAIMI: <i>Richie, you told me that
Marvel makes a new logo</i>

9
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:35,369
<i>for every picture they make.</i>

10
00:00:35,453 --> 00:00:36,537
<i>Is that true?</i>

11
00:00:36,621 --> 00:00:39,040
PALMER: <i>Yeah, we like to update
with images</i>

12
00:00:39,123 --> 00:00:40,750
<i>from some of the more recent</i>

13
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:43,836
<i>Disney+ series and movies and make sure
that it's always up to date</i>

14
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,255
<i>with some of the coolest images
from our movies.</i>

15
00:00:46,339 --> 00:00:47,757
<i>This one, we did something special.</i>

16
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,260
<i>I think it was Sam and Bob Murawski,
our editor, and Kevin came together</i>

17
00:00:51,344 --> 00:00:53,558
<i>and said, you know, "We should do
something special for Doctor</i> Strange,

18
00:00:53,638 --> 00:00:55,977
<i>"and put in more images
of Doctor Strange and Wanda in there</i>

19
00:00:56,057 --> 00:00:57,475
<i>"than we've ever seen before."</i>

20
00:01:01,854 --> 00:01:07,401
RAIMI: <i>Michael, it was your idea
to start this movie in this scene.</i>

21
00:01:07,902 --> 00:01:09,612
<i>Um, you wanted to
come into an adventure,</i>

22
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:12,365
<i>you told me,
that was just reaching its climax</i>

23
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:15,743
<i>with the audience not knowing
how they got here</i>

24
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:17,370
<i>and let them play catch up.</i>

25
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,876
WALDRON: <i>Yeah, it always felt like
it'd be fun to feel like</i>

26
00:01:19,956 --> 00:01:24,627
<i>we were really coming in at the end
of another Doctor Strange movie.</i>

27
00:01:27,338 --> 00:01:30,383
- That America has already...
- RAIMI: That's a <i>unique</i> choice.

28
00:01:30,675 --> 00:01:32,680
WALDRON: <i>Yeah, America's already
been through this gauntlet</i>

29
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,553
<i>with another one of these guys.</i>

30
00:01:40,351 --> 00:01:41,936
<i>RAIMI: That's a really unusual choice,</i>

31
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:44,063
<i>given that you're also
taking these pages</i>

32
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:46,315
<i>to introduce America Chavez.</i>

33
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:49,944
<i>To come in on the wrap up,</i>

34
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:52,822
<i>you don't really get to meet her
in a conventional way</i>

35
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:54,407
<i>in the movie, in your writing.</i>

36
00:01:55,408 --> 00:01:58,536
WALDRON: <i>And have the first lines
that they're speaking to one another</i>

37
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:02,915
<i>be in Spanish, too, was just fun and,
kind of, unmooring for the audience.</i>

38
00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:11,757
PALMER: <i>I love this look
of Doctor Strange's in this scene.</i>

39
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,176
<i>We were inspired by some comics,</i>

40
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,513
<i>and I know Sam
and we all worked together</i>

41
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:19,352
<i>with Graham Churchyard,
our costume designer,</i>

42
00:02:19,432 --> 00:02:21,020
<i>and our Marvel Studios
Visual Development team,</i>

43
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,477
<i>led by Ryan Meinerding and Ian Joyner.</i>

44
00:02:23,561 --> 00:02:26,067
<i>This is one of my favourite looks,
though, in this movie of Doctor Strange.</i>

45
00:02:26,147 --> 00:02:28,149
<i>I love the ponytail.
I don't know about you guys</i>

46
00:02:28,232 --> 00:02:31,235
<i>but I love the red and black suit
and the ponytail and the beard.</i>

47
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:38,162
<i>RAIMI: I'm not crazy about the ponytail.</i>

48
00:02:38,242 --> 00:02:39,410
(ALL LAUGHING)

49
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:42,455
<i>But, basically,
I think it's a great choice,</i>

50
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:44,415
<i>given that we wanted to make him</i>

51
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:46,834
<i>kind of an Errol Flynn
version of Strange.</i>

52
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:49,211
<i>Like the... Originally, Michael...</i>

53
00:02:49,295 --> 00:02:52,715
<i>Michael's idea was, he's an even better
version of Strange than Strange himself.</i>

54
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:53,924
But we're friends.

55
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:58,304
<i>RAIMI: Until he weakens here morally</i>

56
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:01,557
<i>and believes that
the ends justify the means.</i>

57
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:03,809
...your sacrifice is worth
more than your...

58
00:03:03,893 --> 00:03:05,606
RAIMI: <i>Originally, Michael,
you wrote this Strange</i>

59
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:08,105
<i>as the better version of the man</i>

60
00:03:08,314 --> 00:03:11,567
<i>and then, going back,
we made him a sinner.</i>

61
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:15,863
<i>And you added a flaw,
where he makes his terrible choice</i>

62
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:19,784
<i>to save the universe at the expense
of this young girl's life.</i>

63
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:24,121
WALDRON: <i>Yeah, that was kind of a
late-in-the game decision</i>

64
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:29,043
<i>that really re—contextualised
Strange and America's relationship</i>

65
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:33,089
<i>throughout the entire movie,
and then worked.</i>

(DRAMATIC CHORAL MUSIC PLAYING)

69
00:03:42,223 --> 00:03:43,811
RAIMI: <i>So, Michael,
a lot of the movie that you wrote,</i>

70
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:48,604
<i>you had to follow in the footsteps
of the latest Sewer-Man movie,</i>

71
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:51,190
<i>No Way Home, and WandaVision.
Is that true?</i>

72
00:03:52,024 --> 00:03:54,902
WALDRON: <i>I think it was always in there
at some point or another,</i>

73
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:58,239
<i>but maybe at different points
in the movie,</i>

74
00:03:58,322 --> 00:04:02,159
<i>and it showed up later
in the Illuminati sequence.</i>

75
00:04:02,243 --> 00:04:03,664
RAIMI: <i>Did they let you
read the scripts?</i>

76
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,079
<i>WALDRON: Some of them.</i>

77
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:08,624
<i>WandaVision, I mean,
I'm friends with all the writers.</i>

78
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:11,794
<i>No Way Home, there was a lot of secrecy.</i>

79
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:14,839
WandaVision <i>they had shot,
and a lot of it was airing</i>

80
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:19,009
<i>even as we were making this.
So, that, we were more up to speed.</i>

81
00:04:28,352 --> 00:04:29,645
Excuse me. May I?

82
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:31,188
Thanks.

83
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:44,118
RAIMI: <i>In this scene,
there's the great Michael Stuhlbarg,</i>

84
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,455
<i>who I loved
in the Coen brothers classic,</i>

85
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:49,206
A Serious Man.

86
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:52,293
<i>WALDRON: He's so great. I was selfishly</i>

87
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:54,211
<i>just so excited
to write dialogue for him.</i>

88
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:55,796
<i>He's such a tremendous actor.</i>

89
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:57,089
Haven't seen you in a while.

90
00:04:57,173 --> 00:05:01,427
<i>Really wanted to give him a lot
to work with even in this short scene.</i>

91
00:05:01,594 --> 00:05:03,095
So were a lot of us.

92
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:09,518
RAIMI: <i>You did. He has bitter feelings
about Strange's choice,</i>

93
00:05:09,602 --> 00:05:14,315
<i>his egotistical choice, and questions
whether he's always so certain</i>

94
00:05:14,398 --> 00:05:15,691
<i>that he's doing the right thing,</i>

95
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:18,235
<i>which I really like
for the theme of the picture.</i>

96
00:05:20,488 --> 00:05:21,947
I'm very sorry.

97
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:23,824
Thank you.

98
00:05:23,908 --> 00:05:26,080
RAIMI: <i>And at this point in the movie,
the way you wrote it, Michael,</i>

99
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,161
<i>he has no self-doubt.</i>

100
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:29,205
<i>He's certain that
he did the right thing.</i>

101
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:33,375
<i>Just like the Strange
we saw in Universe 617.</i>

102
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:36,670
<i>That's what we refer to
as the opening sequence.</i>

103
00:05:36,754 --> 00:05:38,968
<i>For that Strange, he was certain
he was doing the right thing,</i>

104
00:05:39,048 --> 00:05:40,841
<i>sacrificing that little girl.</i>

105
00:05:40,925 --> 00:05:43,260
<i>And it's great
that you later pit him against</i>

106
00:05:43,344 --> 00:05:46,472
<i>other Stranges who are certain
they're doing the right thing.</i>

107
00:05:46,764 --> 00:05:48,766
No, I made the only play we had.

108
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,184
Well, of course you did.

109
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,728
RAIMI: <i>He learns that</i>
he's <i>not always right</i>

110
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:54,897
<i>and that he doesn't always
have to be the one,</i>

<i>in your words, Michael,

<i>which I think is great.</i>

00:05:58,359 --> 00:05:59,818
<i>He becomes a tiny bit more open,</i>

114

<i>I thought,
through the course of your screenplay.</i>

<i>when he finally saw the woman

296
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,601
<i>a New York pizzeria.</i>

297
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:54,356
...which is why I'm still sitting here,
waiting for you to enlighten us.

298
00:14:54,436 --> 00:14:56,063
<i>RAIMI: Seems super authentic to me.</i>

299
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:58,774
<i>The details that he had in that place...
I'm sorry I couldn't</i>

300
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:00,358
<i>get in closer on a lot of them.</i>

301
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:02,903
<i>But the set was just beautiful.</i>

302
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:04,654
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

303
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:08,825
WALDRON: <i>I feel like Richie and I
ate a lot of pizza on these days.</i>

304
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:10,368
I left a very nice wedding...

305
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:11,495
<i>WALDRON: Tested it out.</i>

306
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,375
...to save a smart-ass kid
from getting eaten by an octopus.

307
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:14,751
- Whose wedding?
- Now tell me... Christine's.

308
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:16,545
PALMER: <i>I'm pretty particular
about the quality of pizza.</i>

309
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:17,918
- Do you mind?
- Yes, I do.

310
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:19,294
<i>PALMER: In this movie.</i>

311
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:21,463
You need to explain to me
What's going on.

312
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:23,924
RAIMI: <i>John Mathieson,
our cinematographer,</i>

313
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:26,468
<i>did a brilliant job
photographing this scene.</i>

314
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:29,137
<i>He had three cameras
and really kept them alive.</i>

315
00:15:29,221 --> 00:15:31,807
<i>Super long lenses
to give us some New York depth.</i>

316
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:32,933
What power?

317
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:36,394
RAIMI: <i>Because, finally, it's
an eight-page, six-page dialogue scene.</i>

318
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:39,606
<i>It could have just sat in the middle
of the movie</i>

319
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:43,401
<i>but the actors and the writing
have really helped us get through it.</i>

320
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:46,571
<i>You don't expect to find
six pages of exposition</i>

321
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:51,451
<i>in the first act of a Marvel picture,
but there is a lot of catching up to do</i>

322
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:52,831
<i>and lot of setting up
that we have to do.</i>

323
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:54,708
Well, you guys knew of
this magical book of pure good

324
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:56,877
that gives a sorcerer whatever they need
to defeat their enemy.

325
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:59,334
PALMER: <i>It's really a testament
to Xochitl Gomez's skills</i>

326
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:03,797
<i>as a young actress to being able
to deliver a lot of exposition,</i>

327
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,469
<i>like you're saying,
and doing it in a fun way</i>

328
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:08,885
<i>that it really doesn't feel
like you're hearing exposition.</i>

329
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:11,638
WALDRON: <i>Yeah, this was early
in the shoot, too.</i>

330
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:16,518
<i>She was tremendous. So, we just
talked about these scenes with...</i>

331
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:19,938
<i>kind of akin to John Connor
in</i> Terminator <i>2.</i>

332
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:22,524
<i>The way he's bringing the audience
up to speed a little bit</i>

333
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:25,902
<i>but he's got just enough
moxie and attitude</i>

334
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:28,780
<i>that it goes down in kind of a fun way.</i>

335
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,116
I thought you'd protect me...

336
00:16:34,578 --> 00:16:35,579
but you didn't.

337
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:37,122
That was the fight in my dream.

338
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:39,708
That wasn't a dream.

339
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:43,420
<i>RAIMI: There were so many contributors
to the movie,</i>

340
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,881
<i>from storyboard artists
who came up with great ideas</i>

341
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:48,592
<i>to visual effects supervisor,
Janek Sirrs.</i>

342
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:55,348
<i>It was his idea that the Ribbon Monster
infect Strange</i>

343
00:16:55,557 --> 00:17:00,812
<i>with a rapidly advancing alien virus</i>

344
00:17:00,896 --> 00:17:04,774
<i>that ages him and turns him
into a corpse very quickly.</i>

345
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:08,987
<i>And that's because
Michael came up with the idea</i>

346
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:13,491
<i>that Dead Strange walks
in this movie later, in the third act,</i>

347
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:16,995
<i>and we really wanted to have a look
that looked like a classic zombie,</i>

348
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:18,705
<i>a classic monster picture.</i>

349
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:20,540
<i>But to get him there...</i>

350
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:22,876
<i>Janek came up with this idea</i>

351
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,672
<i>because, really, only something like
36 hours or 24 hours had passed</i>

352
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:29,094
<i>throughout the course
of the whole movie,</i>

353
00:17:29,174 --> 00:17:31,051
<i>so there had to be justification.</i>

354
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:33,557
<i>And Janek fixed that like he fixed
so many other things in the film.</i>

355
00:17:33,637 --> 00:17:34,763
America Chavez.

356
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:39,434
WALDRON: <i>Could always count on Janek
to be my partner in a logic battle.</i>

357
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:42,357
<i>Also Dead Strange, I've got
to give credit to Richie as well.</i>

358
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:46,066
<i>That was the two of us
sitting in his office in London</i>

359
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:50,320
<i>and thinking, "Oh, my God,
how do we figure out this third act?"</i>

360
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:54,407
<i>RAIMI: That was a great idea.</i>

361
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:56,993
PALMER: <i>And America Chavez
is a character</i>

362
00:17:57,077 --> 00:18:00,747
<i>we've wanted to introduce into the MCU
for, like, a decade</i>

363
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,832
<i>and we're very happy
to do it in this movie.</i>

364
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,671
<i>But it made perfect sense
to do it in this movie,</i>

365
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:07,671
<i>given that her powers are
opening Multiversal portals.</i>

366
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,634
...did it have the same markings
as the octopus?

367
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:12,721
WALDRON: <i>Supposed to have a pigeon
pecking his eyeball at one point, right?</i>

368
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:14,386
This isn't sorcery.

369
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:15,595
<i>PALMER: As it was scripted.</i>

370
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,681
<i>WALDRON: As scripted.</i>

371
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:21,977
<i>The script is just a suggestion.
It was a refrain...</i>

372
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:24,938
<i>...on this film.</i>

373
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:26,898
- Chocolate!
- Hey!

374
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:28,108
<i>PALMER: Wanda Maxim off.</i>

375
00:18:28,191 --> 00:18:31,444
<i>So, this is Wanda and Billy and Tommy
in Universe 838.</i>

376
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:36,449
<i>And this set is based on the house
from</i> WandaVision.

377
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:38,285
<i>And Charlie Wood,
our production designer,</i>

378
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:40,245
<i>worked with the</i> WandaVision <i>team</i>

379
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:42,872
<i>to make a version of the house
that you saw on</i> WandaVision

380
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:45,417
<i>go through all those different
sitcom eras</i>

381
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,211
<i>and change and adapt by the decade.</i>

382
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:50,592
<i>But this is the real-world version
of what it would look like</i>

383
00:18:50,672 --> 00:18:53,675
<i>if Wanda Maxim off actually
lived there with her two boys</i>

384
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:55,844
<i>in the real world in Universe 838.</i>

385
00:18:57,804 --> 00:19:03,727
WALDRON: <i>It's crazy to be shooting this
movie as WandaVision was coming out</i>

386
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:08,565
<i>and it's just clearly becoming
more and more of a sensation</i>

387
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:10,650
<i>and the biggest thing in the world.</i>

388
00:19:10,734 --> 00:19:14,779
<i>And every day we'd come in and
we'd think, "Oh, man, this is really...</i>

389
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:16,698
<i>"We've really got to get this right."</i>

390
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:23,747
<i>But fortunately, when you've got Lizzie,
it's hard to screw it up.</i>

391
00:19:36,968 --> 00:19:39,262
PALMER: <i>Apples?</i>
WALDRON: <i>Apples?</i>

392
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,890
Apples, right?

393
00:19:41,973 --> 00:19:43,683
RAIMI: <i>Those are actually
cherry blossoms.</i>

394
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:44,768
Eventually.

395
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:46,144
(RAIMI LAUGHS)

396
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:50,110
RAIMI: <i>Those were cherry blossoms
because they were the only thing</i>

397
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,192
<i>blooming at that time that we shot this.</i>

398
00:19:52,275 --> 00:19:54,986
<i>So, all those blossoms
you see on the trees</i>

399
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:58,531
<i>were put up by Charles Wood
and his very diligent, hardworking crew.</i>

400
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:02,952
<i>They were fake blossoms,
and that crew was out there for a week</i>

401
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:05,914
<i>on ladders, breaking their back
to put up all those blossoms.</i>

402
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:09,459
<i>And our director of photography,
John Mathieson,</i>

403
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:12,212
<i>designed it
so that they're always backlit.</i>

404
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:15,465
<i>And he had a plan where we would
move around the orchard,</i>

405
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:19,844
<i>always having the sun shine
on those fake blossoms from behind,</i>

406
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:22,764
<i>making this idyllic Wanda world.</i>

407
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:25,767
With What?

408
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:28,728
RAIMI: <i>Idyllic because
it's just an illusion. It's a hex.</i>

409
00:20:30,355 --> 00:20:32,899
PALMER: <i>The sheep. One of the best
special effects in the movie</i>

410
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:35,693
<i>was these sheep, that shepherd.</i>

411
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:39,406
<i>This guy and his sheepdog
just running around</i>

412
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:41,491
<i>herding their sheep.
That sheepdog was mean.</i>

413
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,743
<i>I tried to pet him, I almost got bitten.</i>

414
00:20:44,035 --> 00:20:46,121
One that covets her power for itself.

415
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:49,457
We've taken her to Kamar-Taj,
and we've got our defences...

416
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:50,583
<i>PALMER: Those guys.</i>

417
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:52,252
...but we could use an Avenger.

418
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:54,254
There are other Avengers.

419
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:57,257
Yeah, but given the choice between
the archer with the mohawk...

420
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,843
and several bug-themed crime fighters...

421
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:04,055
or one of the most powerful
magic-wielders on the planet...

422
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:05,807
it's an easy call.

423
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:10,019
RAIMI: <i>Therefore, because those blossoms
were all plastic,</i>

424
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:13,398
<i>those are fake blossoms
blowing in the breeze.</i>

425
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:16,401
<i>Blossom boy! He had a giant wind fan.</i>

426
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:18,573
<i>We'd get him up in the air
before the dialogues start,</i>

427
00:21:18,653 --> 00:21:20,029
<i>kill the fan and start the take.</i>

428
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:22,031
I know what it's like
to be on your own...

429
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:24,742
hunted for abilities you never wanted...

430
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:26,494
and I can protect her.

431
00:21:26,578 --> 00:21:29,247
<i>WALDRON: Such an exciting scene for fans</i>

432
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:33,042
<i>to finally get these two
on screen together.</i>

433
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:34,836
<i>PALMER: That's right.</i>

434

WALDRON: <i>A lot of times they debate</i>
who's <i>the most powerful person</i>

435
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:39,924
<i>in the MCU.</i>

<i>These are two big contenders for it,
right here.</i>

437

You know, the Hex was the easy part.

00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:58,776
<i>where you had Wanda be a good person,</i>

442
00:21:59,611 --> 00:22:02,530
<i>uncorrupted throughout
the entire adventure.</i>

443
00:22:02,614 --> 00:22:05,658
<i>It was only in the last scenes
of the film</i>

444
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:10,413
<i>that she finally turned
and crossed over to the dark side.</i>

445
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,291
<i>And then I think you and me
had discussions about</i>

446
00:22:14,417 --> 00:22:18,796
<i>"Why should we let the greatest moment
of the movie setup</i>

447
00:22:19,756 --> 00:22:23,676
<i>"be the ending and really just
open the door for the next one?</i>

448
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,012
<i>"Let's bring that good stuff forward."</i>

449
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:28,806
<i>So then, I think, you re-wrote.</i>

450
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:32,393
<i>Along with a lot of other reasons,
you decided to make Wanda</i>

451
00:22:32,477 --> 00:22:35,021
<i>the villain from the go—get,
so we can see that delicious battle</i>

452
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:39,108
<i>between Strange and Wanda throughout
the meat of our film.</i>

453
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:43,446
WALDRON: <i>Yeah, that was when
our movie pushed because of COVID.</i>

454
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:46,950
<i>We were originally supposed to shoot
in May of 2020</i>

455
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:50,870
<i>and we pushed until late that year.</i>

456
00:22:50,954 --> 00:22:54,832
<i>And there was an opportunity,
if we wanted,</i>

457
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:58,002
<i>to blow this thing up and start over,
or what would we do?</i>

458
00:22:58,211 --> 00:22:59,587
Wouldn't you want to go there?

459
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:01,885
WALDRON: <i>That would be
the most delectable choice.</i>

460
00:23:01,965 --> 00:23:03,344
<i>See, guys,
this is why the movie's so good.</i>

461
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:06,427
<i>This is why we're at 99
on Rotten Tomatoes. Sam and I are so...</i>

462
00:23:06,511 --> 00:23:09,347
What you're doing is a flagrant
violation of every natural law...

463
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:12,392
WALDRON: <i>Anyways, why let somebody else
have fun with Wanda being bad?</i>

464
00:23:12,475 --> 00:23:15,228
RAIMI: <i>That's why you're good.
You're the writer extraordinaire.</i>

465
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,063
But she's not a child.

466
00:23:17,188 --> 00:23:19,023
She's a supernatural being.

467
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:23,486
Such raw power could wreak havoc
on this and other worlds.

468
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:24,946
Her sacrifice...

469
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:27,323
would be for the greater good.

470
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:28,953
Well, you can kiss
the lunch box goodbye,

471
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:31,744
'cause that's the kind of justification
our enemies use.

472
00:23:31,828 --> 00:23:33,329
Is it the one you used

473
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:36,499
when you gave Thanos the Time Stone?

474
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:43,214
RAIMI: <i>I think this really hit
our test audience in a strong, good way,</i>

475
00:23:43,298 --> 00:23:45,717
<i>this scene that you wrote,</i>

476
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:49,095
<i>because they're not used
to seeing their hero, Wanda,</i>

477
00:23:50,013 --> 00:23:52,473
<i>turn to the side of evil.</i>

478
00:23:52,557 --> 00:23:54,892
<i>It really is a powerful choice</i>

479
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:58,021
<i>to watch one of their heroes fall.</i>

480
00:23:58,104 --> 00:24:00,982
PALMER: <i>I'm also not sure
they're ready to see our hero,</i>

481
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:03,318
<i>Doctor Strange,
be put in such a position</i>

482
00:24:03,401 --> 00:24:05,653
<i>where he's being confronted
with that from her.</i>

483
00:24:05,737 --> 00:24:09,616
<i>"You gave up the Time Stone
and look what it did to me, Strange."</i>

484
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:14,037
<i>We love Wanda, we don't want to see her
go through the pain she's gone through.</i>

485
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,039
<i>And you could lead it all
back to that moment.</i>

486
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:19,876
WALDRON: <i>I would argue Wanda is making
some pretty sound points here,</i>

487
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:23,129
<i>and I think that makes
for the best villains,</i>

488
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:25,798
<i>the villains that you can really,
you know,</i>

489
00:24:25,882 --> 00:24:29,093
<i>believe are the heroes
of their own story.</i>

490
00:24:29,177 --> 00:24:33,056
<i>Erik Killmonger, Thanos, Loki.</i>

491
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:35,645
RAIMI: <i>I think that was one of your
finest accomplishments with the script,</i>

492
00:24:35,725 --> 00:24:37,445
<i>was that you made our villain
a human being.</i>

493
00:24:39,562 --> 00:24:41,064
<i>And with motives we understand</i>

494
00:24:42,357 --> 00:24:45,735
<i>and, if not root for, just empathise.</i>

495
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:47,695
<i>We can empathise with her.</i>

496
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:50,365
<i>WALDRON: Thanks, pal.</i>

497
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,246
PALMER: <i>Anybody see Master Hamir
from the first movie?</i>

498
00:24:53,326 --> 00:24:54,827
<i>One of my favourite characters.</i>

499
00:24:54,911 --> 00:24:57,622
WALDRON: <i>This was day two, right?
This was early.</i>

500
00:24:57,705 --> 00:24:59,666
...or annihilate the cosmos.

501
00:24:59,874 --> 00:25:01,514
She took over a whole town
using her mind.

502
00:25:01,668 --> 00:25:04,549
<i>RAIMI: This was one of the first scenes
we blocked, I think, with the actors.</i>

503
00:25:04,629 --> 00:25:06,422
If she gets America's power...

504
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:09,634
she could enslave the entire Multiverse.

505
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:14,097
<i>I love Benedict's reading
coming up here.</i>

506
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:18,267
<i>He kind of messed up in his line.</i>

507
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:20,728
Yeah.

508
00:25:21,562 --> 00:25:24,065
Suspend teaching at once
and arm the students.

509
00:25:24,482 --> 00:25:27,652
<i>She doesn't trust him.
That was a great beat, Michael.</i>

510
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:31,322
<i>And Wong is so commanding.</i>

511
00:25:31,406 --> 00:25:33,574
<i>The bell, the drums.</i>

512
00:25:33,658 --> 00:25:36,138
PALMER: <i>The drums, you want
to talk about those war drums, Sam?</i>

513
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:39,208
<i>- We had Danny Elf man...</i>
- RAIMI: <i>You talk about it.</i>

514
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:40,835
PALMER: <i>We had Danny Elf man
very early on.</i>

515
00:25:40,915 --> 00:25:42,625
<i>Before he was really scoring the movie,</i>

516
00:25:42,709 --> 00:25:45,670
<i>he gave us war drums
that we could play on set</i>

517
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:47,755
<i>so that we can really amp the energy</i>

518
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:51,217
<i>and know the cadence of those drums
as we're going into this battle.</i>

519
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,301
<i>It was really exciting.</i>

520
00:25:52,802 --> 00:25:54,470
<i>Added something to the day.</i>

521
00:25:56,389 --> 00:25:57,515
<i>RAIMI. That's right.</i>

522
00:25:57,598 --> 00:26:00,143
<i>It was so helpful,
Danny Elf man giving us so much</i>

523
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:01,853
<i>all throughout the course of this film.</i>

524
00:26:01,978 --> 00:26:02,979
<i>PALMER: Mmm-hmm.</i>

525
00:26:04,856 --> 00:26:07,400
<i>- There he is, that rascal.</i>
- WALDRON: <i>Rintrah.</i>

526
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:10,865
PALMER: <i>Rintrah is a great character
from the comics</i>

527
00:26:10,945 --> 00:26:12,405
<i>that I believe Michael found.</i>

528
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:15,241
RAIMI: <i>Adam Hugill plays that role.
He did a wonderful job.</i>

529
00:26:17,785 --> 00:26:19,707
PALMER: <i>We get to see</i> some <i>masters
from other Sanctums.</i>

530
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:22,623
<i>The Hong Kong and London Sanctum.</i>

531
00:26:25,418 --> 00:26:28,045
<i>RAIMI: I love that East meets West bow,</i>

532
00:26:28,129 --> 00:26:33,050
<i>showing the different styles
of the masters of the Sanctums.</i>

533
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:36,888
<i>This was another gigantic set</i>

534
00:26:36,971 --> 00:26:39,432
<i>that Charles Wood
and his team designed for us.</i>

535
00:26:44,896 --> 00:26:46,105
<i>I thought it was beautiful.</i>

536
00:26:57,617 --> 00:27:01,162
WALDRON: <i>I was just going to say,
I love the sequel trope</i>

537
00:27:01,704 --> 00:27:05,166
<i>of the sacred base getting attacked.</i>

538
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:07,710
<i>I feel like that's a thing you see
in a lot of sequels</i>

539
00:27:07,794 --> 00:27:09,170
<i>that I actually like.</i>

540
00:27:10,171 --> 00:27:11,672
<i>We're, I guess, ripping off.</i>

541
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:22,016
<i>RAIMI: We originally had a sub-theme
that Michael wrote,</i>

542
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,894
<i>with the character of Sara,</i>

543
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:28,272
<i>who was in the previous scene,
Wong's right-hand woman.</i>

544
00:27:30,233 --> 00:27:34,028
<i>We have a little bit of a love line
between Wong and Sara.</i>

545
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:37,657
<i>That's Sheila Atim that plays that role.</i>

546
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:40,493
<i>But that got diminished,
as happens with cuts.</i>

547
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:43,788
<i>We just wanted to focus
on our main heroes,</i>

548
00:27:43,871 --> 00:27:45,752
<i>and the story took on
a little too many dimensions,</i>

549
00:27:45,832 --> 00:27:47,542
<i>and we had to focus it down,</i>

550
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:50,253
<i>so that little bit
of a suggested love story was lost.</i>

551
00:27:51,337 --> 00:27:53,381
You had to make terrible sacrifices.

552
00:27:53,464 --> 00:27:56,259
I blew a hole through the head
of the man I loved...

553
00:27:57,468 --> 00:27:59,428
and it meant nothing.

554
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:03,182
Do not speak to me of sacrifice,
Stephen Strange.

555
00:28:03,266 --> 00:28:05,268
<i>WALDRON: I like hitting that,</i>

556
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:09,522
<i>the fact that what Wanda did
at the end of</i> Infinity <i>War</i>

557
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:11,774
<i>actually meant nothing,</i>

558
00:28:11,858 --> 00:28:15,194
<i>that Thanos just reversed it
with the Time Stone</i>

559
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:17,113
<i>and killed Vision, anyways.</i>

560
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:22,285
<i>Felt like something
that was just too poignant</i>

561
00:28:22,368 --> 00:28:23,619
<i>to really not run out.</i>

562
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:27,373
Defensive positions, now!

563
00:28:27,498 --> 00:28:28,541
PALMER: <i>Here</i> we go.

564
00:28:34,922 --> 00:28:37,091
Do not dare to enter
these sacred grounds.

565
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:40,636
You have no idea
just how reasonable I have been.

566
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,721
Yeah.

567
00:28:41,804 --> 00:28:43,434
Book of the Damned,
calling yourself a witch,

568
00:28:43,514 --> 00:28:45,019
conjuring creatures to abduct a kid...

569
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:47,476
I don't exactly
call that being reasonable.

570
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:51,522
Sending those creatures after her
instead of myself was mercy.

571
00:28:52,857 --> 00:28:56,611
And, in spite of your hypocrisies
and insults,

572
00:28:56,694 --> 00:29:00,197
I have begged you
to safely get out of my way.

573
00:29:00,281 --> 00:29:01,908
<i>PALMER: They're both such good actors.</i>

574
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:04,160
You have exhausted my patience...

575
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:08,956
but I do hope you understand
that even now...

576
00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:11,626
what's about to happen...

577
00:29:12,835 --> 00:29:13,878
this is me...

578
00:29:14,629 --> 00:29:17,340
being reasonable.

579
00:29:18,007 --> 00:29:20,301
RAIMI: <i>Costume designer
Graham Churchyard</i>

580
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:24,013
<i>really did a great job with Wanda's
costume, updating it from WandaVision.</i>

581
00:29:24,305 --> 00:29:27,224
<i>We had to keep the basic design
once she'd become the Scarlet Witch</i>

582
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:31,020
<i>but I thought that he took it
to the next level beautifully.</i>

583
00:29:35,816 --> 00:29:38,945
WALDRON: <i>About a year's worth
and movie's worth of heartache,</i>

584
00:29:39,445 --> 00:29:41,656
<i>I think, go into that blast from Wanda.</i>

585
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:48,371
<i>I think we earned what's about to happen</i>

586
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:51,958
<i>on the backs of the great work
that Lizzie has done over the years.</i>

587
00:29:52,792 --> 00:29:54,835

00:38:01,905 --> 00:38:04,283
WALDRON: <i>Shout out to Xochitl.
She does such a great job</i>

737
00:38:04,366 --> 00:38:07,494
<i>every time she's getting
her soul drained.</i>

738
00:38:07,578 --> 00:38:11,331
<i>It was a very physically gruelling
bit of acting,</i>

739
00:38:11,415 --> 00:38:14,418
<i>and she was really game
and did a fantastic job.</i>

740
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:16,548
<i>PALMER: I remember Sam, you going,</i>

741
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:18,384
<i>"Xochitl, do you think
you could do the thing,</i>

742
00:38:18,464 --> 00:38:20,507
<i>"you know, where you
roll your eyes up a little bit</i>

743
00:38:20,591 --> 00:38:22,513
<i>"and maybe you can show us
some of the whites there?"</i>

744
00:38:22,593 --> 00:38:24,970
<i>And she did it amazingly right away.</i>

745
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:26,100
<i>She just went, "Like this?"</i>

746
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,476
<i>And all you saw
were the whites of her eyes.</i>

747
00:38:27,556 --> 00:38:29,349
<i>And we were, like, "Oh, my God."</i>

748
00:38:29,433 --> 00:38:31,185
<i>RAIMI: Yeah, she was so good at that.</i>

749
00:38:31,268 --> 00:38:32,269
Crap.

750
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:33,896
<i>WALDRON: It's like The Undertaker.</i>

751
00:38:34,271 --> 00:38:37,524
PALMER: <i>Benedict Cumberbatch
is a great collaborator,</i>

752
00:38:37,608 --> 00:38:38,859
<i>but one of the funniest guys.</i>

753
00:38:38,942 --> 00:38:41,278
<i>I'm not sure people know
that he's actually really funny.</i>

754
00:38:41,361 --> 00:38:44,281
<i>That whole vomiting after,
that was all him...</i>

755
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:45,657
All right, America.

756
00:38:45,741 --> 00:38:48,243
PALMER: <i>...just doing his thing,
and he was great.</i>

757
00:38:48,327 --> 00:38:50,412
<i>He's a really good physical comedian.</i>

758
00:38:50,496 --> 00:38:52,372
- You just did it.
- Not on purpose.

759
00:38:52,456 --> 00:38:55,667
Wong is back there alone with Wanda,
and I'm the only hope he has.

760
00:38:55,751 --> 00:38:58,257
- I can't control my powers...
- You must be able to control it somehow.

761
00:38:58,337 --> 00:38:59,421
Even I could...

762
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:05,636
WALDRON: <i>Sam, this became a rooftop
relatively late in the process.</i>

763
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:08,263
<i>For a while, they landed in an alley</i>

764
00:39:09,348 --> 00:39:11,141
<i>in every universe and I think we...</i>

765
00:39:11,225 --> 00:39:12,521
- DOCTOR STRANGE: What?
- None of them do.

766
00:39:12,601 --> 00:39:15,479
WALDRON: <i>...realised maybe</i> we'd <i>have
a little bit more fun visually,</i>

767
00:39:15,562 --> 00:39:16,939
<i>I guess, on a rooftop.</i>

768
00:39:17,147 --> 00:39:19,066
And 'cause I never dream.

769
00:39:19,233 --> 00:39:22,694
<i>RAIMI: Yes, we had shot this
in the alley exactly</i>

770
00:39:23,195 --> 00:39:25,531
<i>and then re—did it here on the rooftop</i>

771
00:39:25,614 --> 00:39:27,950
<i>to be able to see the world
we're talking about.</i>

772
00:39:28,075 --> 00:39:30,661
<i>Because they had come
into a new universe,</i>

773
00:39:30,744 --> 00:39:32,329
<i>we wanted to see it visually.</i>

774
00:39:32,412 --> 00:39:36,208
<i>Tell the story through the camera
of their environment.</i>

775
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:38,544
<i>And the alley didn't allow that view.</i>

776
00:39:38,961 --> 00:39:41,505
I don't know where it is,
so unless there's another Other Me...

777
00:39:44,007 --> 00:39:45,342
We need to go find...

778
00:39:46,218 --> 00:39:47,928
Other Other Me.

779
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:54,476
<i>This was the alley. So, the scene
used to take place in that alley.</i>

780
00:40:02,818 --> 00:40:04,444
<i>And this was the big reveal.</i>

781
00:40:04,528 --> 00:40:08,031
<i>But we decided, "Why are we
waiting so long for the reveal?"</i>

782
00:40:08,115 --> 00:40:12,202
<i>I think Kevin also wanted it,
to see more of this universe.</i>

783
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:17,082
<i>He was very on top of us,
making sure that we made</i>

784
00:40:17,708 --> 00:40:20,252
<i>a proper presentation
to the Marvel audience of</i>

785
00:40:21,211 --> 00:40:24,298
<i>what another parallel universe
would look like.</i>

786
00:40:24,423 --> 00:40:28,260
<i>It was difficult only because
we didn't want to go sci-fl.</i>

787
00:40:29,303 --> 00:40:31,513
<i>And we wanted to make sure
it was like our universe,</i>

788
00:40:31,597 --> 00:40:33,265
<i>just a few shades different.</i>

789
00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:36,184
<i>And that's a more difficult thing to do</i>

790
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:39,187
<i>than just creating a brand-new look.</i>

791
00:40:39,354 --> 00:40:41,898
<i>It's got to be recognisable
but different.</i>

792
00:40:42,024 --> 00:40:43,358
<i>The same but different.</i>

793
00:40:43,442 --> 00:40:45,319
<i>Just like the characters that we meet.</i>

794
00:40:45,402 --> 00:40:49,489
<i>Like Strange's alter egos are the same
but a few percent different.</i>

795
00:40:50,157 --> 00:40:51,620
<i>PALMER: Mmm. Look at those pizza balls.</i>

796
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,163
RAIMI: <i>Richie,
those are your pizza balls.</i>

797
00:40:53,243 --> 00:40:54,369
<i>WALDRON: Ate a lot of those.</i>

798
00:40:54,453 --> 00:40:55,746
<i>PALMER: Thank you, sir.</i>

799
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:57,789
It's weird you guys have to pay for it.

800
00:40:57,873 --> 00:40:59,333
Hey! You didn't pay for that.

801
00:40:59,416 --> 00:41:00,417
PALMER: <i>There</i> he is.

802
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,502
Crap. Maybe it's not free here.

803
00:41:02,586 --> 00:41:05,213
- Pizza Poppa always gets paid.
- All right, Pizza Poppa...

804
00:41:05,297 --> 00:41:06,510
<i>RAIMI: My buddy Bruce Campbell...</i>

805
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:08,842
Relax yourself, there, Doctor Strange.

806
00:41:08,925 --> 00:41:11,678
<i>WALDRON: Blast on set. I might imagine.</i>

807
00:41:12,346 --> 00:41:13,597
That feels authentic.

808
00:41:13,847 --> 00:41:16,019
It's not a cape, it's a cloak,
and I suggest you let go.

809
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:17,229
You took this whole suit from...

810
00:41:17,309 --> 00:41:21,104
PALMER: <i>Charlie Wood, our production
designer, worked with you, Sam,</i>

811
00:41:21,188 --> 00:41:22,439
<i>and Bruce Campbell, of course,</i>

812
00:41:22,522 --> 00:41:24,524
<i>and our editor, Bob Murawski,</i>

813
00:41:25,192 --> 00:41:27,486
<i>and our lead storyboard artist,
Doug Lefter.</i>

814
00:41:27,569 --> 00:41:30,530
<i>Everybody from the world
that worked together on Army at Darkness</i>

815
00:41:30,614 --> 00:41:31,948
<i>came back together on this movie.</i>

816
00:41:32,032 --> 00:41:35,077
<i>And there's a funny story
where Charlie actually has the prop</i>

817
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:38,330
<i>of the fork from Army at Darkness
that he brought to set that day.</i>

818
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:39,831
<i>And we actually used as...</i>

819
00:41:39,915 --> 00:41:43,168
<i>If you eagle-eyed viewers,
can see it on that Pizza Poppa cart</i>

820
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:44,711
<i>later in the movie.</i>

821
00:41:44,795 --> 00:41:47,214
RAIMI: <i>That's right.
That's the fork from</i> Army <i>of</i> Darkness

822
00:41:47,297 --> 00:41:52,969
<i>that the little Ashes use
to stick in Bruce Campbell's buttocks.</i>

WALDRON: <i>You might not be able to see
in that scene</i>

825
00:41:56,264 --> 00:41:59,810
<i>but, later, when you see Bruce again,
after the credits,</i>

826
00:41:59,893 --> 00:42:01,481
<i>you should keep an eye out
for that fork.</i>

827
00:42:01,561 --> 00:42:02,729
That's a lot.

828
00:42:02,813 --> 00:42:06,483
WALDRON: <i>There's a lot of amazing
preparation work, Sam, that you did</i>

829
00:42:06,566 --> 00:42:09,444
<i>on these sequences
because there was so much choreography</i>

830
00:42:09,528 --> 00:42:11,571
<i>in how they move about
these city streets,</i>

831
00:42:11,655 --> 00:42:14,700
<i>and a lot of it was also done by Lorne,</i>

832
00:42:14,783 --> 00:42:18,453
<i>your son, who was going out
and shooting test footage</i>

833
00:42:18,537 --> 00:42:21,790
<i>just a couple of days in advance,
with stand-ins and everything.</i>

834
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:25,127
<i>And it was so awesome for me to see</i>

835
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:28,505
<i>how you and him worked together,
and he would shoot this footage</i>

836
00:42:28,588 --> 00:42:31,925
<i>and then you'd bring it to life
and everything. That was really neat.</i>

837
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:33,180
<i>PALMER: Shout out to Lorne Raimi.</i>

838
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:37,973
WALDRON: <i>Yeah, Lorne was such a real
asset to us on the movie,</i>

839
00:42:38,056 --> 00:42:40,600
<i>and is a heck of a filmmaker himself.</i>

00:44:39,845 --> 00:44:44,266
<i>Trying to kind of disprove her notion
that all Doctor Stranges are bad.</i>

884
00:44:44,391 --> 00:44:45,767
Yes, that was Christine.

885
00:44:45,851 --> 00:44:47,936
- How do you know her?
- From Other You.

886
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:51,314
PALMER: <i>I love this location. I love
those trees holding up the High Line.</i>

887
00:44:51,398 --> 00:44:54,693
<i>This universe's version
of the High Line, at least.</i>

888
00:44:54,818 --> 00:44:57,904
RAIMI: <i>Yeah, although we shot
the bulk of the picture in England,</i>

889
00:44:58,363 --> 00:45:00,240
<i>we did additional reshoots</i>

890
00:45:00,323 --> 00:45:02,617
<i>in the United States in California,</i>

891
00:45:03,785 --> 00:45:06,079
<i>and John Mathieson
wasn't able to be there.</i>

892
00:45:06,162 --> 00:45:09,499
<i>He was for the first few weeks,
first part of the reshoot.</i>

893
00:45:09,583 --> 00:45:11,293
<i>But then second reshoot went on,</i>

894
00:45:11,376 --> 00:45:14,254
<i>and then we had to use
his replacement cinematographers,</i>

895
00:45:14,337 --> 00:45:16,256
<i>Dan Mandel, who was awesome,</i>

896
00:45:16,339 --> 00:45:19,342
<i>and the great Russell Carpenter,
who shot</i> Titanic.

897
00:45:23,763 --> 00:45:24,768
<i>PALMER: Yeah, we got so lucky.</i>

898
00:45:24,848 --> 00:45:26,478
<i>John called in
favours from friends for us</i>

899
00:45:26,558 --> 00:45:30,604
<i>'cause we got some of the best DPs
in the world working on this movie</i>

900
00:45:30,687 --> 00:45:32,814
<i>and the luxury of working
with more than one.</i>

901
00:45:34,441 --> 00:45:35,901
<i>WALDRON: This statue was amazing.</i>

902
00:45:35,984 --> 00:45:40,822
<i>I mean, that thing is real,
and it was crazy to stand under it.</i>

903
00:45:43,366 --> 00:45:46,536
<i>You really had to listen
to Benedict on those days.</i>

904
00:45:48,788 --> 00:45:50,248
"Gave his life defeating Thanos"?

905
00:45:50,332 --> 00:45:52,083
Yeah. See? We're not all bad.

906
00:45:53,585 --> 00:45:55,170
If Other You's dead...

907
00:45:55,629 --> 00:45:57,088
who's Master of the Sanctum?

908
00:45:57,172 --> 00:46:00,012
RAIMI: <i>It's cool, that last shot,
seeing another version of the Sanctum.</i>

909
00:46:03,386 --> 00:46:05,347
Oh, shit.

910
00:46:09,601 --> 00:46:11,144
<i>RAIMI: And here we meet alt Mordo.</i>

911
00:46:11,227 --> 00:46:13,063
<i>WALDRON: I loved how you shot this, Sam.</i>

912
00:46:13,521 --> 00:46:16,775
<i>Shot this</i> Quick and the Dead,

913
00:46:16,942 --> 00:46:19,361
<i>and the two gunfighters facing off.</i>

914
00:46:19,486 --> 00:46:21,446
<i>Fun to watch you
put this scene together.</i>

915
00:46:22,948 --> 00:46:27,661
RAIMI: <i>Thanks. And I think Kevin thought
maybe it was a little corny.</i>

916
00:46:28,244 --> 00:46:29,537
<i>And he wanted to cut it out.</i>

917
00:46:29,621 --> 00:46:30,959
<i>But I said,
"Please, Kevin, let me have that."</i>

918
00:46:31,039 --> 00:46:34,292
<i>He went, "Okay, fine.
Have your corny stuff."</i>

919
00:46:34,376 --> 00:46:36,336
<i>It was very, very kind of him, generous.</i>

920
00:46:36,419 --> 00:46:37,424
<i>WALDRON: I'm glad you won.</i>

921
00:46:37,504 --> 00:46:40,840
Because you always suspected
this day would come.

922
00:46:41,091 --> 00:46:43,635
<i>RAIMI: Chiwetel Ejiofor, he's so great</i>

923
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:45,929
<i>playing the alt version of Mordo.</i>

924
00:46:49,641 --> 00:46:52,978
PALMER: <i>It's another awesome look.</i>
RAIMI: <i>Michael, you had written...</i>

925
00:46:53,395 --> 00:46:55,605
<i>I was just going to say
that Michael had written</i>

926
00:46:55,689 --> 00:46:59,526
<i>an early scene with Chiwetel
where we saw him in our universe, 616,</i>

927
00:47:01,194 --> 00:47:05,615
<i>where he was the Mordo
that we knew from Doctor Strange 1.</i>

928
00:47:06,533 --> 00:47:10,245
<i>Only he had been through many battles
since that. He had a limp,</i>

929
00:47:10,745 --> 00:47:14,124
<i>and he was coming after
the Scarlet Witch to take her power</i>

930
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:18,470
<i>because he knew she was dark
and terribly corrupted by the Dark hold.</i>

931
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:21,673
<i>And she killed him and cutoff his head.</i>

932
00:47:21,798 --> 00:47:24,050
<i>Presented it to Strange
in a later scene.</i>

933
00:47:24,134 --> 00:47:25,719
<i>It was really great writing,</i>

934
00:47:25,802 --> 00:47:28,596
<i>but it slowed the beginning down
too much, so we had to lose it.</i>

935
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:31,141
So she has the Dark hold?

936
00:47:31,224 --> 00:47:33,268
WALDRON: <i>Yeah, that was a fun scene
that just didn't</i>

937
00:47:33,351 --> 00:47:36,187
<i>have a place in the movie.
But it was cool. I think that</i>

938
00:47:36,312 --> 00:47:39,274
<i>she cut his head off
right halfway through his ears</i>

939
00:47:39,357 --> 00:47:41,860
<i>about to say, "The bill comes due."</i>

940
00:47:42,569 --> 00:47:43,695
Damn right.

941
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:45,613
But if your Dark hold
is anything like ours,

942
00:47:45,697 --> 00:47:47,198
I'm afraid she can do far worse

943
00:47:47,282 --> 00:47:50,910
than just summon monsters
to come after you here.

944
00:47:51,411 --> 00:47:52,412
What do you mean?

945
00:47:52,662 --> 00:47:56,416
There is a spell
contained within those pages...

946
00:47:58,001 --> 00:47:59,589
PALMER: <i>The rest of the movie
is just going to be me saying,</i>

947
00:47:59,669 --> 00:48:01,508
<i>"This is one of my favourite
parts of the movie,"</i>

948
00:48:01,588 --> 00:48:03,176
<i>because this is one of
my favourite parts of the movie,</i>

949
00:48:03,256 --> 00:48:05,467
<i>and this, you know, Sam, you and John</i>

950
00:48:06,468 --> 00:48:09,345
<i>shot awesome stuff for this...</i>

951
00:48:09,429 --> 00:48:11,264
<i>Awesome equipment, like the mesmeriser,</i>

952
00:48:11,347 --> 00:48:12,766
<i>but then it was really Tia Nolan</i>

953
00:48:12,849 --> 00:48:17,145
<i>who brought it to life
in such an amazing and unexpected way.</i>

954
00:48:20,482 --> 00:48:22,942
<i>Along with Danny Elf man, of course.</i>

955
00:48:23,026 --> 00:48:25,904
<i>This is such an amazing
piece of the score here.</i>

956
00:48:25,987 --> 00:48:27,405
838 MORDO: ...enemies from afar.

957
00:48:30,575 --> 00:48:34,287
The possession is not a permanent link
between realities.

958
00:48:35,038 --> 00:48:37,040
But in the fleeting time
they Dream walk...

959
00:48:37,749 --> 00:48:41,586
they can do irreparable damage
to the universe they invade.

960
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:46,049
So it may not be a demon...

961
00:48:46,174 --> 00:48:51,429
WALDRON: <i>The idea of Dream walking
was a kind of early-on discovery</i>

962
00:48:51,513 --> 00:48:53,848
<i>for, I guess, all three of us.</i>

963
00:48:54,349 --> 00:48:56,768
<i>This notion that you could possess</i>

964
00:48:56,893 --> 00:48:59,979
<i>an alternate version of yourself
in another universe,</i>

965
00:49:00,063 --> 00:49:04,109
<i>that felt like a really creepy,
sinister thing</i>

966
00:49:04,192 --> 00:49:06,361
<i>for Wanda to be able to do</i>

967
00:49:07,028 --> 00:49:09,489
<i>that really kind of became the backbone</i>

968
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:12,909
<i>of the movie in a lot of ways.</i>

969
00:49:15,078 --> 00:49:16,329
PALMER: <i>Here</i> we go.

970
00:49:16,788 --> 00:49:18,626
<i>The Sands of Nisanti.
Should we talk about it for a second?</i>

971
00:49:18,706 --> 00:49:21,126
<i>Michael, that was one of your
discoveries from the comics.</i>

972
00:49:21,209 --> 00:49:24,170
<i>It's a relic in the comics that
if you're near the Sands of Nisanti,</i>

973
00:49:24,254 --> 00:49:27,423
<i>it strips you of your magic powers
for a temporary...</i>

974
00:49:27,549 --> 00:49:30,260
WALDRON: <i>Yeah, the Sands of Nisanti
shows up in The Oath,</i>

975
00:49:31,094 --> 00:49:33,138
<i>Doctor Strange comic by Mark Millar.</i>

976
00:49:33,221 --> 00:49:35,056
<i>They're actually used by Nic West,</i>

977
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:37,433
<i>the character that
Michael Stuhlbarg plays</i>

978
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:41,396
<i>in the comics,
becomes an adversarial sorcerer.</i>

979
00:49:42,897 --> 00:49:46,192
<i>And battles against Doctor Strange
in that comic's run.</i>

980
00:49:46,359 --> 00:49:51,406
<i>And he uses the Sands of Nisanti
to strip Strange of his powers.</i>

981
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:55,702
<i>And, so, if it's in the comics,
it's automatically cool.</i>

982
00:49:55,869 --> 00:49:57,495
<i>PALMER: It is cool. That's cool.</i>

983
00:49:57,579 --> 00:50:01,708
<i>Mordo uses the Sands to
knock out Strange and America here,</i>

984
00:50:01,791 --> 00:50:03,334
<i>and then we find out in a few minutes</i>

985
00:50:03,751 --> 00:50:06,629
<i>that Christine also knows
how to use the Sands of Nisanti.</i>

986
00:50:06,713 --> 00:50:08,756
<i>WALDRON: I love that iris closing shot.</i>

987
00:50:10,091 --> 00:50:13,428
RAIMI: <i>Danny's score here really rocks.
It's so cool.</i>

988
00:50:15,471 --> 00:50:17,515
PALMER: <i>This shot
was another Janek Sirrs plus,</i>

989
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:20,518
<i>that is actually really awesome.</i>

990
00:50:20,602 --> 00:50:23,402
<i>I love travelling through the Multiverse
with Wanda's spirit like that.</i>

991
00:50:26,941 --> 00:50:28,735
BILLY: Can we have
a little more ice cream?

992
00:50:28,818 --> 00:50:30,198
TOMMY: Please.
BILLY: Please, please, please!

993
00:50:30,278 --> 00:50:31,279
A little more, please!

994
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:32,408
838 WANDA: Hey, don't make Mum
out to be the bad guy.

995
00:50:32,488 --> 00:50:33,740
BILLY: You know who's the best?

996
00:50:33,823 --> 00:50:36,075
TOMMY: Who?
BILLY: 2003 Tigers.

997
00:50:36,201 --> 00:50:37,744
TOMMY: They suck.

998
00:50:37,827 --> 00:50:40,872
WALDRON: <i>You gave the kids
some good dialogue to riff Sam</i>

999
00:50:40,955 --> 00:50:43,041
<i>about how the Tigers</i>

1000
00:50:43,124 --> 00:50:45,960
<i>had won the World Series
in this alternate universe, right?</i>

1001
00:50:46,044 --> 00:50:47,712
<i>Isn't that what they're talking about?</i>

1002
00:50:47,795 --> 00:50:51,633
RAIMI: <i>Yeah, the 2003 Tigers,
they're saying are so awesome,</i>

1003
00:50:52,634 --> 00:50:54,719
<i>but that was one of our sadder years.</i>

1004
00:50:54,844 --> 00:50:56,638
<i>But not in this universe.
In this universe,</i>

1005
00:50:56,721 --> 00:50:59,766
<i>my Tigers won the World Series in 2003.</i>

1006
00:51:02,518 --> 00:51:05,230
WALDRON: <i>This was a great
horror sequence that, again,</i>

1007
00:51:05,313 --> 00:51:07,065
<i>Lorne, I think, did a lot of the...</i>

1008
00:51:10,026 --> 00:51:11,861
<i>A lot of the work on.</i>

1009
00:51:12,987 --> 00:51:13,992
<i>RAIMI: It wasn't this one.</i>

1010
00:51:14,072 --> 00:51:16,282
<i>It was the final scene, I think,</i>

1011
00:51:16,366 --> 00:51:18,451
<i>- in Wanda's house.</i>
- WALDRON: <i>Right.</i>

1012
00:51:19,285 --> 00:51:22,080
RAIMI: <i>But, yeah, he did.
He did those peas and the cup.</i>

1013
00:51:22,163 --> 00:51:23,623
<i>He did some of the some of these</i>

1014
00:51:23,706 --> 00:51:25,124
<i>insert shots.
PALMER: You're right.</i>

1015
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:27,585
<i>- The lamp.</i>
- RAIMI: <i>I'm sorry. I stand corrected.</i>

1016
00:51:27,794 --> 00:51:29,048
<i>PALMER: The tempest in a teacup.</i>

1017
00:51:29,128 --> 00:51:31,467
<i>I know, Sam, you loved...
That was one of the first things...</i>

1018
00:51:31,547 --> 00:51:36,928
<i>Charlie Wood came to Burbank to present
to you, you know, ideas for</i>

1019
00:51:37,011 --> 00:51:40,223
<i>other universes in the Multiverse,
and I remember him saying to you,</i>

1020
00:51:40,306 --> 00:51:42,809
<i>"There's this idea I have
of showing a tempest in a teacup.</i>

1021
00:51:42,892 --> 00:51:44,772
<i>"I don't know where to use it,
but it's awesome."</i>

1022
00:51:44,852 --> 00:51:47,317
<i>And you're, like, "That is awesome.
We're going to put it in the movie."</i>

1023
00:51:47,397 --> 00:51:48,815
<i>And it's here.</i>

1024
00:51:48,898 --> 00:51:51,571
<i>I love your explanation of it, that
it's just a little bit of our universe</i>

1025
00:51:51,651 --> 00:51:53,444
<i>creeping into this universe.</i>

1026
00:51:53,653 --> 00:51:54,779

<i>I mean, even in the script stage,
this whole idea</i>

<i>that she is travelling to this universe

<i>to be able to show her with the kids</i>

You know,
you hated me where I came from.

01:15:22,102 --> 01:15:24,729
And I bet, secretly, my brother,
you hated me here.

RAIMI: <i>Most of this Illuminati scene
was shot with individual actors.</i>

1457

<i>The other actor wasn't even present,

1460
01:15:38,076 --> 01:15:41,079
<i>they were pretty much
all done separately.</i>

1461

<i>One or two of the actors
were together, and that was it.</i>

up in that lineup but, ultimately,</i>

<i>and working with our editors,
Bob and Tia,</i>

1471
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:25,331
<i>they've really made it come alive and...</i>

1472
01:16:27,417 --> 01:16:31,755
<i>And it's more than just a cameo,
saying dialogue.</i>

1473
01:16:31,838 --> 01:16:37,135
<i>It's a compelling, exciting sequence,
which is not easy to do.</i>

<i>That was a fake leg.
That was a leg on a broom.</i>

<i>I remember you having to walk up there
where Benedict was.</i>

1481
01:16:59,908 --> 01:17:02,228
WALDRON: <i>Yeah, I was up there.
Everybody else was on wires.</i>

1482

<i>So, it was, like, "I'm gonna..."</i>

1483
01:17:05,455 --> 01:17:08,625
PALMER: <i>It was a really, really
high-up platform that Benedict was on</i>

1484
01:17:08,708 --> 01:17:10,505
<i>and, like Michael just said,
everybody was on wires</i>

1485
01:17:10,585 --> 01:17:13,049
<i>and then Benedict's, like, "Michael,
could I talk to you for a second?</i>

1486
01:17:13,129 --> 01:17:14,884
<i>And Michael had to climb
all the way up on this.</i>

<i>Trying not to show Benedict
how frightened I was.</i>

<i>WALDRON: That's what making a movie is.</i>

1492
01:17:27,894 --> 01:17:31,105
<i>It's just trying to never show
how frightened you are.</i>

<i>Such a pro.</i>

WALDRON: <i>Lizzie talked about how,
by this point in the movie, she's Wanda.</i>

1517
01:19:21,633 --> 01:19:25,094
<i>Our Wanda is just consumed by anger.</i>

1518
01:19:25,178 --> 01:19:28,431
<i>She's been pushed so far,</i>

1519
01:19:29,724 --> 01:19:33,394
<i>that's really what's driving her
to her madness at this point.</i>

Yeah. Your way.

<i>It's her bloody feet

<i>She does not care about this body

<i>This is one of my favourite things,
this practical effect right here.</i>

PALMER: <i>And this was Jamie Christopher

<i>That was another idea
we had in that moment, right, Sam?</i>

1559

<i>It was just Jamie saying, "Hey,
you want to blow up those tables?</i>

<i>"We can do it." Jamie always had this

come up with them in the moment.</i>

<i>So, he was always trying to just
come up with practical effects,</i>

1563
01:21:22,211 --> 01:21:23,758
<i>and it really was a plus for the movie.</i>

<i>And that was one of the coolest ones.</i>

1565

<i>RAIMI: Yeah, that was a real plus.</i>

1566
01:21:28,176 --> 01:21:30,762
<i>And I almost didn't do it
even after he said that.</i>

1567
01:21:30,845 --> 01:21:33,723
<i>And Bob Ross, he was on set

<i>"It's not gonna take that much time,"

running through the tunnels are amazing.</i>

1572

WALDRON: <i>You had a motorcycle
in the tunnels, right, Sam,</i>

1573
01:21:47,320 --> 01:21:50,448
<i>- with a camera on the back?</i>
- RAIMI: <i>That's right.</i>

1574
01:21:50,531 --> 01:21:53,159
<i>Our cinematographer lined us up
with a great device.</i>

<i>You know, it's a little mini steadicam,</i>

1576

<i>on the back of a motorcycle.
It was really cool.</i>

1577
01:21:58,331 --> 01:21:59,457
<i>Perfect way to do it.</i>

1578
01:21:59,540 --> 01:22:02,418
<i>I had originally wanted him
to give me streams of light,</i>

1579
01:22:03,169 --> 01:22:06,506
<i>in concentric circles,
moving in opposing</i>

1580
01:22:06,589 --> 01:22:10,635
<i>directions of the camera,
and he quickly didn't do that.</i>

1581
01:22:10,885 --> 01:22:12,015
<i>I think he thought it was too hokey,</i>

1582
01:22:12,095 --> 01:22:14,806
<i>but I really wanted it to be
more hypnotic and dizzying,</i>

1583
01:22:14,889 --> 01:22:16,432
<i>that chase through the tunnels,</i>

1584
01:22:16,516 --> 01:22:19,102
<i>but it turned out to be a good move
not to do that.</i>

1585
01:22:20,895 --> 01:22:21,979
I warned you.

PALMER: <i>Yes, I recall your creation
of the slowing down of the drips</i>

- Did you kill her?
- No, just bought us some time.

RAIMI: <i>That was a device
to try and build suspense</i>

1592
01:22:42,875 --> 01:22:46,337
<i>and get us to the point
where that scare really delivered.</i>

1593
01:22:46,629 --> 01:22:49,215
<i>And Bob did a really good job
of cutting that, I thought.</i>

1594
01:22:55,972 --> 01:22:58,269
An enchantment that's specific to me,
something only I would know.

1595
01:22:58,349 --> 01:23:00,935
<i>WALDRON: It's a nice opportunity</i>

1596
01:23:01,018 --> 01:23:03,771
<i>to call back the watch,
which is a great emotional...</i>

1597
01:23:05,022 --> 01:23:09,569
<i>I mean, really, when I watched the
first movie in preparation for this,</i>

1598
01:23:09,652 --> 01:23:11,696
<i>I watched it a thousand times</i>

1599
01:23:11,779 --> 01:23:15,908
<i>and that watch was kind of
the emotional core of that movie,</i>

1600
01:23:16,033 --> 01:23:19,745
<i>so it felt like a cool way
to bring it back.</i>

1601
01:23:21,164 --> 01:23:23,583
<i>It's something
that kind of unifies Stranges</i>

1602
01:23:23,666 --> 01:23:25,877
<i>and Christines across all universes.</i>

1603
01:23:27,295 --> 01:23:28,335
<i>PALMER: It's really cool.</i>

1604
01:23:32,425 --> 01:23:33,718
<i>All right.</i>

1605
01:23:35,428 --> 01:23:38,181
WALDRON: <i>For a long time,</i>
Sam's <i>editor, Bob,</i>

1606
01:23:38,806 --> 01:23:41,934
<i>had Strange open the door,
I don't know where he pulled it.</i>

1607
01:23:42,018 --> 01:23:43,853
<i>It sounded like Snake Plissken talking.</i>

1608
01:23:43,936 --> 01:23:46,772
<i>As that door's opening, he just goes,
"All right"</i>

1609
01:23:47,315 --> 01:23:50,193
PALMER: Sam's <i>editor put it in,
and Marvel's editor took it out.</i>

1610
01:23:50,276 --> 01:23:51,777
<i>RAIMI: It was actually...</i>

1611
01:23:51,861 --> 01:23:55,489
<i>It was Benedict kind of making fun,
but Bob loved it.</i>

1612
01:23:55,573 --> 01:23:57,575
<i>He really wanted that in the picture.</i>

1613
01:23:59,035 --> 01:24:00,119
Come on, kid.

1614
01:24:00,620 --> 01:24:01,621
You got this.

1615
01:24:03,456 --> 01:24:04,874
We got this.

1616
01:24:07,251 --> 01:24:08,252
Yeah.

1617
01:24:14,467 --> 01:24:15,638
PALMER: <i>This whole sequence
coming up right here,</i>

1618
01:24:15,718 --> 01:24:18,221
<i>Benedict Cumberbatch
really collaborated with us</i>

1619
01:24:18,387 --> 01:24:20,223
<i>in such a detail-orientated way,</i>

1620
01:24:20,306 --> 01:24:22,225
<i>and it's such a cool part
of the movie now,</i>

1621
01:24:22,308 --> 01:24:24,685
<i>but he really had
such a specific idea for this moment</i>

1622
01:24:24,769 --> 01:24:27,104
<i>that he kept pitching us about,
"We get to the book,</i>

1623
01:24:27,188 --> 01:24:30,107
<i>"And then Wanda's gonna show up
and just rip America from our..."</i>

1624
01:24:30,191 --> 01:24:31,776
<i>And he always talked about it</i>

1625
01:24:31,859 --> 01:24:34,237
<i>and it really came to life
in a great way.</i>

1626
01:24:37,740 --> 01:24:39,325
All right, Book.

1627
01:24:42,411 --> 01:24:44,121
Give me what I need.

1628
01:24:52,129 --> 01:24:56,759
WALDRON: <i>The temp score in the scene
was always James Homer's Aliens score.</i>

1629
01:24:57,468 --> 01:25:01,430
<i>It was appropriate
because a reference for this shot</i>

1630
01:25:01,514 --> 01:25:05,184
<i>was when Bishop gets stabbed
at the end of Aliens.</i>

1631
01:25:07,728 --> 01:25:11,732
<i>Showed Xochitl that before we shot that.</i>

1632
01:25:15,945 --> 01:25:18,239
PALMER: <i>You guys notice
that star in the book?</i>

1633
01:25:26,372 --> 01:25:28,833
RAIMI: <i>Michael, here, you wrote
about The Book of Vishanti</i>

1634
01:25:28,916 --> 01:25:33,838
<i>as that thing which gives the sorcerer
whatever they need</i>

1635
01:25:34,130 --> 01:25:35,548
<i>to defeat their enemy.</i>

1636
01:25:35,631 --> 01:25:40,094
<i>Yes, and that star is to signify
that the lore of the book is true.</i>

1637
01:25:40,344 --> 01:25:44,640
<i>And what Strange needed was
America Chavez, her help.</i>

1638
01:25:45,349 --> 01:25:46,767
<i>And that's what he finally</i>

1639
01:25:47,518 --> 01:25:49,687
<i>surrenders to
by the climax of the picture.</i>

1640
01:25:49,770 --> 01:25:51,022
<i>WALDRON: Correct.</i>

1641
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:53,444
RAIMI: <i>That he doesn't have to be
the one holding the knife,</i>

1642
01:25:53,524 --> 01:25:54,775
<i>as Michael wrote it.</i>

1643
01:25:56,777 --> 01:25:57,820
My boys.

1644
01:26:03,159 --> 01:26:07,163
WALDRON: <i>I always liked the idea
that we could set up this MacGuffin</i>

1645
01:26:07,246 --> 01:26:11,000
<i>throughout the entire movie
and then just blow it to hell</i>

1646
01:26:11,083 --> 01:26:14,128
<i>as we kind of catapult into
the third act.</i>

1647
01:26:18,841 --> 01:26:19,845
<i>RAIMI: That was a great stunt.</i>

1648
01:26:19,925 --> 01:26:23,429
<i>Brycen Counts did our stunts.
Incredible stunt coordinator.</i>

1649
01:26:24,013 --> 01:26:25,639
<i>PALMER: Shout out Brycen.</i>

1650
01:26:27,391 --> 01:26:28,934
They'll never know.

1651
01:26:29,352 --> 01:26:30,603
Maybe not.

1652
01:26:30,686 --> 01:26:31,771
But you will.

1653
01:26:35,816 --> 01:26:37,068
Oh, no.

1654
01:26:37,151 --> 01:26:38,402
Oh, crap.

1655
01:26:39,403 --> 01:26:41,158
PALMER: (LAUGHS) <i>That "Oh, crap!"
always made Rachel laugh.</i>

1656
01:26:41,238 --> 01:26:42,952
838 CHRISTINE: It's like this reality
collapsed in on itself.

1657
01:26:43,032 --> 01:26:44,033
DOCTOR STRANGE: Yeah.

1658
01:26:44,492 --> 01:26:46,410
- Or two realities collided.
- (WHOOSHING)

1659
01:26:47,244 --> 01:26:48,371
Come on.

1660
01:26:48,954 --> 01:26:50,373
America doesn't have long.

1661
01:26:50,539 --> 01:26:54,377
WALDRON: <i>Really amazing combination
of practical effects.</i>

1662
01:26:54,460 --> 01:26:56,754
<i>PALMER: Hey, the Delta 88, Sam.</i>

1663
01:26:57,046 --> 01:26:59,590
RAIMI: <i>Wow.</i>
PALMER: <i>That was actually hoisted up.</i>

1664
01:26:59,715 --> 01:27:03,803
<i>Again, Charlie Wood and his team.
They got that Delta 88 to the UK.</i>

1665
01:27:03,886 --> 01:27:07,139
<i>And hoisted it up on giant cranes
and spun it around for us.</i>

1666
01:27:07,223 --> 01:27:08,682
<i>That's all practical.</i>

1667
01:27:13,771 --> 01:27:16,899
<i>Here we get to see
the effects of an Incursion.</i>

1668
01:27:16,982 --> 01:27:17,987
DOCTOR STRANGE:
Well, I can see why you guys

1669
01:27:18,067 --> 01:27:19,387
were so worried about Incursions.

1670
01:27:21,112 --> 01:27:22,530
838 CHRISTINE: Whatever happened,

1671
01:27:23,823 --> 01:27:27,159
this universe's you didn't do
a very good job of stopping it.

1672
01:27:38,421 --> 01:27:41,132
WALDRON: <i>Sam, I wrote so many
different versions of this dialogue.</i>

1673
01:27:44,260 --> 01:27:45,886
<i>An infinite Multiverse.</i>

1674
01:27:46,470 --> 01:27:51,517
RAIMI: <i>Yes. Originally, you wrote
Christine coming in with Strange.</i>

1675
01:27:54,019 --> 01:27:56,605
WALDRON: <i>She came in,
the door shut in her face.</i>

1676
01:27:59,442 --> 01:28:03,279
<i>The building teleported her out,
all sorts of different stuff.</i>

1677
01:28:06,907 --> 01:28:10,536
RAIMI: <i>So many great artists worked
on the look of this movie,</i>

1678
01:28:11,370 --> 01:28:17,418
<i>not just Charles Wood
and John Mathieson, our cinematographer.</i>

1679
01:28:17,501 --> 01:28:22,381
<i>But shots like this were designed
after great artists' paintings of what</i>

1680
01:28:23,215 --> 01:28:28,721
<i>the clash of universes could be like
for this particular environment.</i>

1681
01:28:28,804 --> 01:28:32,016
<i>Strange's place</i> so...

1682
01:28:35,478 --> 01:28:38,481
<i>I was always very impressed
with the concept illustrations.</i>

1683
01:28:38,564 --> 01:28:40,900
<i>We really went for re—creating them.</i>

1684
01:28:41,525 --> 01:28:46,947
<i>That job was done first by the art
directors, and then, later, by</i>

1685
01:28:47,907 --> 01:28:51,118
<i>John Mathieson on set and, then,
in post-production by Janek Sirrs.</i>

1686
01:28:52,828 --> 01:28:54,455
MAN: How did you get here?

1687
01:28:55,456 --> 01:28:58,626
PALMER: <i>I just want to shout out
Cyndi Ochs, our visual effects producer,</i>

1688
01:28:58,834 --> 01:29:01,795
<i>without whom none of that stuff
could have been brought to life.</i>

1689
01:29:01,921 --> 01:29:03,964
I'm just one of us.

1690
01:29:04,048 --> 01:29:05,424
From the Multiverse?

1691
01:29:05,549 --> 01:29:06,550
That's right.

1692
01:29:08,969 --> 01:29:09,970
Prove it.

1693
01:29:13,140 --> 01:29:14,475
We had a sister.

1694
01:29:15,142 --> 01:29:16,393
Donna.

1695
01:29:18,979 --> 01:29:21,444
PALMER: <i>This is rich, and more lore
straight from the comics...</i>

1696
01:29:21,524 --> 01:29:22,900
She died when we were kids.

1697
01:29:22,983 --> 01:29:26,445
PALMER: <i>I know, Sam and Michael,
you guys were always keen on hitting</i>

1698
01:29:26,570 --> 01:29:29,698
<i>and explaining the part of his backstory</i>

1699
01:29:29,782 --> 01:29:32,493
<i>that turned him into who he was</i>

1700
01:29:32,618 --> 01:29:35,454
<i>without it feeling like it was something
that we hadn't known about.</i>

1701
01:29:37,748 --> 01:29:38,868
...she fell through the ice.

1702
01:29:39,083 --> 01:29:42,044
WALDRON: <i>Yeah, the delicate balance of
you don't want it to feel like</i>

1703
01:29:42,127 --> 01:29:45,464
<i>that sequel thing of,
"Wow, a foundational pillar."</i>

1704
01:29:45,798 --> 01:29:46,882
I couldn't save her.

1705
01:29:46,966 --> 01:29:49,677
WALDRON: <i>My personality
just happened to pop up</i>

1706
01:29:50,302 --> 01:29:51,428
<i>here in movie number two.</i>

1707
01:29:51,512 --> 01:29:56,850
<i>But, in this case, I think that Strange
is such a guarded character,</i>

1708
01:29:56,934 --> 01:29:58,852
<i>and it actually makes sense</i>

1709
01:29:58,936 --> 01:30:03,023
<i>that it's simply something he never
ever talks about</i>

1710
01:30:04,024 --> 01:30:06,652
<i>and only does here in this moment
and never really again.</i>

1711
01:30:06,735 --> 01:30:07,778
Until?

1712
01:30:07,861 --> 01:30:10,656
PALMER: <i>Yeah, you guys found a very
elegant way of doing it.</i>

1713
01:30:11,907 --> 01:30:13,200
To whom?

1714
01:30:13,742 --> 01:30:16,620
RAIMI: <i>Michael, you wrote so much
of this movie during production.</i>

1715
01:30:18,205 --> 01:30:19,707
<i>Postproduction, too.</i>

1716
01:30:19,790 --> 01:30:22,543
<i>I remember we were probably
halfway into production</i>

1717
01:30:22,626 --> 01:30:24,795
<i>where you came up with this scene.</i>

1718
01:30:24,878 --> 01:30:28,215
<i>Evil Strange. A brand new concept.</i>

1719
01:30:28,382 --> 01:30:32,219
<i>It didn't exist when we got to England.</i>

1720
01:30:32,344 --> 01:30:35,514
WALDRON: <i>That's true. That is true.</i>
RAIMI: <i>Pre-production.</i>

1721
01:30:35,598 --> 01:30:37,224
That's a start.

1722
01:30:37,683 --> 01:30:43,314
WALDRON: <i>Yeah, there was another version
where Strange went to a universe</i>

1723
01:30:43,397 --> 01:30:46,775
<i>and met a character
that we called Melvin Strange,</i>

1724
01:30:46,942 --> 01:30:51,322
<i>a street magician who was a version
of Strange without any magic.</i>

1725
01:30:53,157 --> 01:30:57,453
<i>And they had, I guess, a... certainly
a much less adversarial conversation.</i>

1726
01:30:57,536 --> 01:31:01,749
<i>It was more of an enlightening,
sweet exchange.</i>

1727
01:31:03,542 --> 01:31:05,002
<i>It was good but it wasn't...</i>

1728
01:31:05,169 --> 01:31:09,465
<i>it didn't build the tension
and raise the stakes we needed</i>

1729
01:31:09,590 --> 01:31:10,883
<i>at this point in the movie.</i>

1730
01:31:11,008 --> 01:31:15,763
<i>And so, really,
collaborated with Benedict,</i>

1731
01:31:15,846 --> 01:31:18,432
<i>and he pushed us to this point.</i>

1732
01:31:20,017 --> 01:31:23,520
<i>We worked with him a lot on this scene.</i>

1733
01:31:24,104 --> 01:31:26,440
<i>He made it. He made it great.</i>

1734
01:31:26,649 --> 01:31:28,696
PALMER: <i>Yeah, he's so good in this scene
on both sides.</i>

1735
01:31:28,776 --> 01:31:31,031
<i>But, yeah, I remember you guys
sitting and working on this.</i>

1736
01:31:31,111 --> 01:31:34,198
<i>There was actually
a little toilet bowl in the set dec.</i>

1737
01:31:34,281 --> 01:31:36,412
<i>If you look in this room,
there's all these weird artifacts.</i>

1738
01:31:36,492 --> 01:31:37,746
<i>There was actually a little toilet bowl</i>

1739
01:31:37,826 --> 01:31:39,707
<i>in the corner
that I believe Michael would sit on</i>

1740
01:31:39,787 --> 01:31:41,955
<i>and write with Benedict
in the corner on his laptop.</i>

1741
01:31:42,039 --> 01:31:44,583
...and wondered why I'd lied.

1742
01:31:46,418 --> 01:31:48,671
I never meant for any of this to happen.

1743
01:31:51,382 --> 01:31:54,009
I was looking for a world
where things were different.

1744
01:31:56,428 --> 01:31:59,556
Where I had Christine,
where I was happy.

1745
01:32:01,850 --> 01:32:02,851
But I didn't find it.

1746
01:32:02,935 --> 01:32:04,607
RAIMI: <i>Michael, when you put
in this third eye,</i>

1747
01:32:04,687 --> 01:32:08,148
<i>that really was an element of the old
Doctor Strange comic books, wasn't it?</i>

1748
01:32:10,234 --> 01:32:11,985
<i>WALDRON: Yeah, that was something,</i>

1749
01:32:12,528 --> 01:32:14,863
<i>it had shown up throughout
the comic books,</i>

1750
01:32:14,947 --> 01:32:19,243
<i>in really Multiversal lore, I guess,
in general.</i>

1751
01:32:23,706 --> 01:32:25,833
<i>Felt like a cool, creepy...</i>

1752
01:32:33,173 --> 01:32:35,384
The Dark hold exacts a heavy toll.

1753
01:32:36,176 --> 01:32:37,302
Okay.

1754
01:32:38,220 --> 01:32:40,889
All the more reason to give it a rest
and let me have it.

1755
01:32:40,973 --> 01:32:42,391
Here's the deal.

1756
01:32:43,350 --> 01:32:44,893
<i>PALMER: One of my favourite lines.</i>

1757
01:32:45,561 --> 01:32:47,646
...if you give me your Christine.

1758
01:32:48,188 --> 01:32:49,481
Yeah.

1759
01:32:49,565 --> 01:32:51,608
I don't think she's gonna go for that.

1760
01:32:51,692 --> 01:32:52,818
No?

1761
01:32:53,652 --> 01:32:55,946
WALDRON: <i>Benedict,
so unflappable as Strange,</i>

1762
01:32:56,029 --> 01:33:00,743
<i>really has a very great
Harrison Ford quality about him,</i>

1763
01:33:00,826 --> 01:33:02,536
<i>such a fun hero to get to write.</i>

1764
01:33:08,917 --> 01:33:11,837
WALDRON: <i>Sam, tell us
about this sequence. It's so great.</i>

1765
01:33:13,213 --> 01:33:15,132
<i>RAIMI: So many artists worked on this.</i>

1766
01:33:15,215 --> 01:33:19,720
<i>I knew we wanted something special
for Sinister Strange,</i>

1767
01:33:19,803 --> 01:33:23,056
<i>and we didn't want to just have a fight.</i>

1768
01:33:24,099 --> 01:33:26,685
<i>Even though we had the world's best
fight choreographers</i>

1769
01:33:27,561 --> 01:33:30,105
<i>and stunt coordinators,
and second unit directors,</i>

1770
01:33:30,189 --> 01:33:33,442
<i>we really wanted to have
something visually unique.</i>

1771
01:33:33,567 --> 01:33:37,613
<i>See Sorcerer vs. Sorcerer,
something we hadn't quite seen before.</i>

1772
01:33:37,863 --> 01:33:39,490
<i>So many artists worked on this.</i>

1773
01:33:39,782 --> 01:33:42,785
<i>Doug Lefter, my great friend
and a brilliant artist</i>

1774
01:33:42,868 --> 01:33:46,622
<i>and great director, really led the way
in this sequence.</i>

1775
01:33:47,498 --> 01:33:49,625
<i>And we followed his lead.</i>

1776
01:33:49,708 --> 01:33:53,337
<i>And, also, Richie,
who was the great artist</i>

1777
01:33:53,420 --> 01:33:55,422
<i>that guided us in the look
of these notes?</i>

1778
01:33:57,007 --> 01:34:00,344
PALMER: <i>Bryan Andrews.</i>
RAIMI: <i>Yeah, we owe him a lot.</i>

1779
01:34:00,511 --> 01:34:03,430
PALMER: <i>Who has been working with us
at Marvel Studios for a decade,</i>

1780
01:34:03,514 --> 01:34:06,225
<i>and he's the director
of our What “I? series.</i>

1781
01:34:06,308 --> 01:34:07,935
<i>RAIMI: He was so great.</i>

1782
01:34:08,018 --> 01:34:09,857
PALMER: <i>Bryan Andrews.
We did have a lot of great artists, Sam.</i>

1783
01:34:09,937 --> 01:34:13,357
<i>Doug Lefter is the best in the biz.</i>

1784
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:16,693
<i>We also had Jeremy Simser, who is
one of the great storyboard artists.</i>

1785
01:34:16,777 --> 01:34:20,197
<i>Anthony Chun, who is Michael's friend
from Rick and Mortys world</i>

1786
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:21,827
<i>came in and helped us with the sequence.</i>

1787
01:34:21,907 --> 01:34:25,452
<i>It really was a family effort
led by Doug.</i>

1788
01:34:25,536 --> 01:34:26,832
<i>And then, of course,
we couldn't have done it</i>

1789
01:34:26,912 --> 01:34:28,914
<i>without Danny Elf man and his team.</i>

1790
01:34:28,997 --> 01:34:32,417
<i>You know, Bill Abbott and
Ellen Segal, of course.</i>

1791
01:34:32,584 --> 01:34:36,338
RAIMI: <i>Danny did such a great job rising
to the occasion for this sequence.</i>

1792
01:34:36,421 --> 01:34:39,132
<i>After he did it for us once,
we went back again and...</i>

1793
01:34:39,842 --> 01:34:43,595
<i>He was in the middle of a concerto
that he had written.</i>

1794
01:34:43,679 --> 01:34:46,515
<i>He was doing the performance in Europe,
and we interrupted him between</i>

1795
01:34:47,516 --> 01:34:49,935
<i>two different performances
to do an emergency rewrite</i>

1796
01:34:50,018 --> 01:34:53,897
<i>where he was... The music of the battle.</i>

1797
01:34:53,981 --> 01:34:56,525
<i>It wasn't the score
so much as it was...</i>

1798
01:34:56,608 --> 01:34:59,444
<i>We wanted him to be
the effects designer, so to speak.</i>

1799
01:34:59,528 --> 01:35:02,447
<i>What is the noise of those notes?</i>

1800
01:35:02,531 --> 01:35:05,033
<i>Let that be the music,
and he blew us away</i>

1801
01:35:05,117 --> 01:35:07,536
<i>with his final designs.</i>

1802
01:35:08,287 --> 01:35:09,291
<i>PALMER: Yeah, it was so amazing.</i>

1803
01:35:09,371 --> 01:35:12,457
<i>That was Danny and Chris Bacon
and Jussi Tegelman.</i>

1804
01:35:13,876 --> 01:35:15,544
<i>Whole squad.</i>

1805
01:35:17,462 --> 01:35:21,925
RAIMI: <i>Jussi did an incredible job in
our sound design along with Addison.</i>

1806
01:35:22,009 --> 01:35:24,344
<i>They both did brilliantly.</i>

1807
01:35:24,428 --> 01:35:27,556
<i>And the movie goes
so many outrageous places,</i>

1808
01:35:27,639 --> 01:35:29,349
<i>that the sound has to follow,</i>

1809
01:35:29,433 --> 01:35:31,310
<i>and, in fact,
the sound has to lead the way</i>

1810
01:35:31,393 --> 01:35:33,729
<i>and break new ground,
Multiversal ground.</i>

1811
01:35:34,730 --> 01:35:37,107
<i>We needed to hear things
we'd never heard before.</i>

1812
01:35:37,357 --> 01:35:39,818
<i>- Like the voice of Black Bolt.</i>
- PALMER: <i>Yeah.</i>

1813
01:35:39,902 --> 01:35:42,529
<i>RAIMI. Or what the alternate universe
would sound like.</i>

1814
01:35:42,613 --> 01:35:46,158
PALMER: <i>Yeah, that was Addison.
That voice of Black Bolt was so cool.</i>

1815
01:35:47,409 --> 01:35:51,204
WALDRON: <i>Such a great physical
performance from Benny Wong.</i>

1816
01:35:51,288 --> 01:35:56,919
<i>He really gets the crap beat out of him
in this movie and you feel it.</i>

1817
01:35:57,002 --> 01:36:00,297
<i>He's that John McClane kind of hero.</i>

1818
01:36:01,798 --> 01:36:05,344
<i>Just getting beat up
and just keeps on going.</i>

1819
01:36:05,427 --> 01:36:07,721
<i>- Love him for it.
- PALMER: Phase One, baby.</i>

1820
01:36:23,362 --> 01:36:24,738
Hang on, we're coming.

1821
01:36:27,699 --> 01:36:30,077
<i>Yeah, this idea of Dead Strange.</i>

1822
01:36:31,161 --> 01:36:33,246
What are you doing with the Dark hold?

1823
01:36:34,790 --> 01:36:38,752
WALDRON: <i>I mean,
I think it came from, literally,</i>

1824
01:36:38,835 --> 01:36:42,339
<i>you were, like, "He's screwed.
He's stuck in this universe."</i>

1825
01:36:42,422 --> 01:36:47,052
<i>I mean, we'd really written ourselves
into a corner, and we were...</i>

1826
01:36:47,135 --> 01:36:49,638
PALMER: <i>We did such a good job
of making it impossible</i>

1827
01:36:49,721 --> 01:36:52,724
<i>to travel between universes
if you are not America Chavez.</i>

1828
01:36:52,808 --> 01:36:54,977
<i>So, now what do we do with him?
He's stranded.</i>

1829
01:36:55,060 --> 01:36:58,230
WALDRON: <i>And, so, Richie and!
just started working it out,</i>

1830
01:36:58,313 --> 01:37:02,943
<i>and it felt like the coolest thing
that Strange could have to do</i>

1831
01:37:03,026 --> 01:37:05,821
<i>was Dream walk, and we wondered...</i>

1832
01:37:05,904 --> 01:37:10,450
<i>The problem is, there's nobody for him
to Dream walk into in our universe.</i>

1833
01:37:10,534 --> 01:37:12,202
<i>Then, the idea came.</i>

1834
01:37:12,285 --> 01:37:17,040
<i>"What if that dead body from the
opening made its way into our universe?"</i>

1835
01:37:17,124 --> 01:37:18,917
<i>So, then we got really excited</i>

1836
01:37:19,001 --> 01:37:24,172
<i>because we knew that
our director was Sam Raimi,</i>

1837
01:37:24,256 --> 01:37:28,844
<i>and we were potentially going to be
possessing a dead body in this movie.</i>

1838
01:37:28,927 --> 01:37:30,724
PALMER: <i>And it's so cool.
Benedict was all in.</i>

1839
01:37:30,804 --> 01:37:36,393
<i>You know, it was not easy for him
to put on that prosthetic makeup.</i>

1840
01:37:36,476 --> 01:37:38,956
<i>That Dead Strange makeup.
That's all Benedict. That's all real.</i>

1841
01:37:39,688 --> 01:37:41,690
<i>It's all practical.
For the most part, of course.</i>

1842
01:37:41,773 --> 01:37:43,692
<i>Janek and the visual effects team had to</i>

1843
01:37:43,775 --> 01:37:45,447
<i>fill out the cavity
on the side of his face,</i>

1844
01:37:45,527 --> 01:37:48,613
<i>but, for the most part,
it's all prosthetics done.</i>

1845
01:37:48,697 --> 01:37:50,449
<i>I gotta give a shout out
to Donald McInnes,</i>

1846
01:37:50,532 --> 01:37:54,494
<i>who is Benedict's lead hair
and makeup person,</i>

1847
01:37:54,578 --> 01:37:56,830
<i>who really helped us come up
with all the designs</i>

1848
01:37:56,913 --> 01:37:58,331
<i>for the various Stranges,</i>

1849
01:37:58,415 --> 01:38:01,918
<i>but was there every step of the way
when it came to Dead Strange as well.</i>

1850
01:38:08,925 --> 01:38:10,594
<i>RAIMI: I love Danny's score here.</i>

1851
01:38:13,680 --> 01:38:16,224
<i>WALDRON: Sammy, you always...</i>

1852
01:38:16,308 --> 01:38:18,268
<i>You know, we came to you and it was,</i>

1853
01:38:18,351 --> 01:38:19,940
<i>"All right, Sam.
We're going to do a dead body.</i>

1854
01:38:20,020 --> 01:38:23,273
<i>"We're so excited."
But you always preached,</i>

1855
01:38:24,900 --> 01:38:27,861
<i>"You can't do a dead body
just for a dead body's sake."</i>

1856
01:38:27,944 --> 01:38:31,615
<i>Like everything with you, it had to be
story-driven, character-driven,</i>

1857
01:38:31,698 --> 01:38:35,368
<i>weren't gonna play it for laughs,
or for gags.</i>

1858
01:38:36,912 --> 01:38:41,083
<i>We were going to take it seriously,
and that's why it works.</i>

1859
01:38:41,166 --> 01:38:44,628
<i>And that's why, I think, we're able
to have fun with the sequence.</i>

1860
01:38:45,295 --> 01:38:47,172
<i>PALMER: Benedict just giving it his all.</i>

1861
01:38:47,255 --> 01:38:50,008
RAIMI: <i>I thought it was such an original
idea you guys came up with.</i>

1862
01:38:50,092 --> 01:38:51,968
<i>So unique.</i>

1863
01:38:52,052 --> 01:38:53,348
<i>That's why I think
the audience likes it,</i>

1864
01:38:53,428 --> 01:38:56,556
<i>because I don't think they've seen
something quite like this before.</i>

1865
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:59,401
PALMER: <i>Not in a Marvel Studios...</i>
RAIMI: <i>The idea of it is different.</i>

1866
01:39:03,522 --> 01:39:07,818
FEMALE SOUL 1: Cease your Dream walk,
or face the eternal consequences.

1867
01:39:08,026 --> 01:39:09,528
(GROANING)

1868
01:39:09,611 --> 01:39:12,030
RAIMI: <i>Weta did a beautiful job
with the animation.</i>

1869
01:39:12,114 --> 01:39:16,451
<i>Great teams of animation.
Great ideas for movement.</i>

1870
01:39:16,576 --> 01:39:19,079
<i>A tremendous amount of artistry
went into their...</i>

1871
01:39:19,871 --> 01:39:22,499
<i>the effects here, I was very impressed.</i>

1872
01:39:24,501 --> 01:39:27,671
<i>PALMER: This is a classic Sam idea</i>

1873
01:39:27,754 --> 01:39:31,174
<i>to plus this
with the souls of the damned</i>

1874
01:39:31,258 --> 01:39:32,926
<i>that attack the dead body.</i>

1875
01:39:33,593 --> 01:39:37,889
<i>Sam, you want to talk about that?
That was just such an amazing addition.</i>

1876
01:39:37,973 --> 01:39:41,476
<i>This sequence, this whole thing.
Those souls.</i>

1877
01:39:44,229 --> 01:39:46,690
RAIMI: <i>Yeah, I think I remember
the test audiences,</i>

1878
