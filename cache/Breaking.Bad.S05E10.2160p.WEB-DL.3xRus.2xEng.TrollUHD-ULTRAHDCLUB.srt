1
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:26,349
{\an8}Mariano, it's me.
I need you to get Skyler on the line.

2
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:30,103
{\an8}No, no, I need you to get her
on the phone right now.

3
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,480
{\an8}Tell her it's urgent.

4
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:37,527
{\an8}No... What do you mean,
she won't get off the phone?

5
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:41,698
{\an8}I am giving you permission, Mariano.
You make her get off the phone.

6
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:52,417
Mariano, who is Skyler on the phone with?

7
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,430
{\an8}Yeah.

8
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:10,936
{\an8}Okay.

9
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:30,580
{\an8}- Where is she? Where's Skyler?
- She just kind of left.

10
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:33,041
{\an8}She didn't say where she was going.

11
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:29,848
{\an8}Skyler, my... My head is spinning.

12
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:34,393
{\an8}And yours, I...

13
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:36,980
{\an8}I can't even imagine.

14
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,444
{\an8}So much makes sense to me now.

15
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:47,616
{\an8}You jumping in the pool,
you sending us your kids, I get it.

16
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:52,454
{\an8}I just wished I'd seen it sooner.

17
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:57,334
He's a monster.

18
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,253
He's a...

19
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:06,217
Look, I don't know what he did to you
to force you to keep his secrets.

20
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:10,805
If he threatened you,
or whatever mind games he played...

21
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,850
I don't know if there was abuse.

22
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:17,270
But I want you to know that
you can be open with me.

23
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,482
Don't hold anything back, okay?

24
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:24,444
I mean, I don't even understand if you
know the full extent of this

25
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:25,904
what he's done.

26
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:30,492
Not just the meth cooking,
but the lives he's destroyed.

27
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:36,915
But, look, that's all behind you,
starting now.

28
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:40,043
You're done being his victim.

29
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:43,213
Because here's what we're gonna do.

30
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:46,132
Sky, here's what we're gonna do.

31
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:50,470
You and the kids will move back
to our house

32
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:53,807
where you'll be safe,
where he can't get to you.

33
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:59,562
Hank, does Marie...?

34
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:03,650
No. We'll get to that soon enough.

35
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,777
It's just you and me right now, okay?

36
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:10,156
Okay.

37
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,866
Before we...

38
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:16,538
Before we get you back to the house, I...

39
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:21,418
I'm gonna ask you to tell me
everything you can.

40
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:23,211
Take as long as you like.

41
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:28,425
Just start from the beginning when you
first became aware of Walt's activities,

42
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:33,304
and just try to be
as detailed as you can.

43
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:38,727
What, right... Right here?

44
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:41,730
- Right now?
- Sure. Why not?

45
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:44,024
While it's still fresh, you know?

46
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:49,612
And just remember to state your name
and the date before you start.

47
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,448
Hank, do...?

48
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:56,161
Do we have to do this right now?

49
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,833
No, we don't have to do this
right now, no.

50
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:07,255
Here's the thing, I need something solid
that I can bring to my people.

51
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:09,507
A statement, on the record.

52
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:12,177
So you testifying to Walt's
criminal activity

53
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,888
whatever you know,
goes a long, long way here.

54
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,640
Okay? I mean, you see,
building a case this big

55
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:20,560
gathering evidence,
enough to get a conviction

56
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,896
we're talking a long-haul proposition.

57
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:26,941
I don't want that bastard running out
the clock. But with your testimony...

58
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,402
What do you mean, running out the clock?

59
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:33,156
His cancer. His cancer is back.

60
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:34,824
So he says.

61
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:38,578
He didn't tell you?

62
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:44,751
Who's to say it's even true?
Lying piece of shit.

63
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:48,296
Look, regardless,
I mean, we'll just assume.

64
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:49,547
Fine. Okay?

65
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:55,553
That son of a bitch looks me in the eye
and he says if what I know is true... "If."

66
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:58,765
...he'll be dead before I can prove it.

67
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,975
The balls on that son of a...

68
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:04,521
I got all these little pieces.
They're all part of the story.

69
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:08,441
They don't mean much on their own,
but when you tell me what you know

70
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:13,404
we start filling in the gaps, I'll have
him in lockup before the sun goes down.

71
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:16,366
Hank, I...

72
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,160
I think maybe...

73
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:20,995
Maybe I need a lawyer.

74
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,914
What?

75
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,999
No, no, no, you don't.

76
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,710
Yeah, I think maybe I do.

77
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:30,088
Skyler, understand,
I am here to help you.

78
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:32,590
But to do that, I need your help.

79
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:36,803
We start bringing in lawyers
and they start putting up roadblocks

80
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,721
where they don't need to be,

81
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:42,058
and my ability to control
this situation diminishes.

82
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:45,436
Just for my own protection, and just...

83
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:51,568
You know, it seems to make sense
that I should have someone to talk to.

84
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:56,614
Skyler, I'm your biggest advocate here,
and I'm telling you, for your own good

85
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:59,534
you need to get out ahead of this thing.

86
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:04,164
I mean, you start, you know,
getting defensive...

87
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,667
I'm not saying it's right,
but I'll tell you it's a fact

88
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:10,628
the DA will look at you differently.

89
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:14,007
- But you don't know that.
- Skyler, yes, I do.

90
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:17,676
I've been around long enough to know.
It's in your best interest

91
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:21,181
to get out there and show the world
you have nothing to hide.

92
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,392
Look...

93
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:30,064
no one in the world
is more important to me

94
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,358
than your sister.

95
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:36,196
So believe me when I tell you

96
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:42,035
that your best interests
and mine are the same.

97
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:45,914
But, Hank, you telling me
not to talk to a lawyer

98
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,458
doesn't sound like that at all.

99
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:51,669
It sounds like what you want...

100
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:57,133
What you want is to get Walt

101
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,717
at all costs.

102
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,679
Okay.

103
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:04,557
Okay, let's just

104
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:07,977
slow down. Slow down.

105
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:09,938
You can...

106
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:13,358
You can talk to a lawyer later.

107
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:18,196
But right now, what we need to do

108
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:20,031
we need to go get the kids.

109
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:23,201
We need to bring them to my house
so that they're safe,

110
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:28,539
and then we need to help each other
put that animal away, okay?

111
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,626
- Come on.
- Hank.

112
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:34,671
Let's go to the house
and we'll deal with it there.

113
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,881
Am I under arrest?

114
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:42,512
- What?
- Am I under arrest?

115
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:51,354
Skyler, I...
You're not thinking straight about this.

116
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:54,274
You have to listen to me. I...
Skyler. Skyler. Skyler.

117
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,690
- Am I under arrest?
- No.

118
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:57,401
- Am I under arrest?
- No. Sky...

119
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,487
- Hank, are you arresting me?
- Sky...

120
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:01,780
Am I under arrest?!

121
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:46,868
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

122
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:53,041
I gotta do it, man.

123
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,757
Dude.

124
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:04,093
What are you doing? Huell.

125
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,012
Hey, quit screwing around.

126
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:10,183
We are here to do a job,
not channel Scrooge McDuck.

127
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,227
- You hearing me?
- I hear you.

128
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:14,771
Dude.

129
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,652
Screw it.

130
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,244
Mexico.

131
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:32,789
All's I'm saying.

132
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,338
Guy hit 10 guys in jail
within a two-minute window.

133
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:42,382
All's I'm saying.

134
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,844
Yeah, it's me again.
Listen, you've got to hide those bags.

135
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:50,056
The monkey is in
the banana patch, capiche?

136
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:51,933
So call me.

137
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:56,604
That's the third message.
Where the hell is that kid?

138
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:00,108
- That's her.
- Don't.

139
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:02,276
- I have to talk to her.
- You don't.

140
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:05,947
Answer that phone and Schrader's
on the line with a wiretap

141
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:09,409
recording everything.
You're not doing anybody any favors.

142
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:12,912
Why do you still have a battery
in that thing? Take it out.

143
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,748
They might be trying
to triangulate your movements.

144
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,209
I'm not being paranoid. Do it.

145
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:23,131
- I can't believe she went to him.
- She just panicked.

146
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:26,134
She went right to him
without even talking to me.

147
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,637
I'm not saying it's not bad.
It's bad, but it could be worse.

148
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:34,017
Really? How much worse could it be,
exactly, in your estimation?

149
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:37,228
What does she actually know?
What has she seen?

150
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:39,981
Nothing. It's hearsay.
It's all he said, she said.

151
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:43,443
The only real evidence
that she can lead them to is your money.

152
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:47,530
Once we take care of that, well, yeah,
then they got nothing.

153
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:51,826
Nothing? Hank knows.
That's not nothing.

154
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:56,497
Yeah. I can't exactly see him
turning the other cheek.

155
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:01,627
Of course there's always...

156
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:05,715
Always what?

157
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:13,848
Have you given any thought
to sending him on a trip to Belize?

158
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:18,478
- Belize?
- Yeah, Belize.

159
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,480
You know, where...

160
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:25,985
Where Mike went to,
off on a trip to Belize.

161
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,947
Saul, you better not be saying
what I think you're saying.

162
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:33,034
- It's just conjecture on my part.
- Hank is family.

163
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:35,801
- Okay, it's an option that...
- You understand that?

164
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:38,998
It's an option that has worked well
for you in the past.

165
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:43,878
- Jesus. What is wrong with you?
- My mistake. Family, off limits, of course.

166
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:47,423
I'm just throwing thoughts out there.
This is a safe room, right?

167
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:51,302
Jesus. Send him to Belize.
I'll send you to Belize.

168
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,515
Finally.

169
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:04,190
It's about time.
Have you two been followed?

170
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:05,733
Are you sure?

171
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,736
If they had,
we'd all be in handcuffs right now.

172
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:19,288
I took the tops off.

173
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:22,291
Figured you'd wanna check
to make sure it's all there.

174
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,876
You figured right.

175
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:30,091
Close enough.

176
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:37,515
- If you need any help on the other end...
- These things are a bitch to move.

177
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:40,226
- I'll manage.
- And we don't mind overtime.

178
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:41,769
Ain't no thing.

179
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:56,284
Pay Huell and Kuby and take your cut.

180
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,412
The rest is mine.
Insurance in case I need you.

181
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:02,582
In case you need me?
I'm thinking the probability is high.

182
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,250
Just find Jesse.

183
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,002
Keys.

184
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:30,336
Saul Goodman, please. Skyler White.

185
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,797
No, no, please don't tell me
he isn't there.

186
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:35,591
I know he's been avoiding my calls.

187
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:39,679
All right, well,
has my husband been there?

188
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:44,308
What do you mean, you don't know?
Either he has or he hasn't. I don't...

189
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:49,188
Sweetie.

190
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:54,151
Sky?

191
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:01,534
Sky, I know you're home.

192
00:20:01,993 --> 00:20:04,161
Let me in. Let me talk to you.

193
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:09,500
I'm just gonna wait here
until you open the door.

194
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:11,877
So let me in now or three hours from now,

195
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,588
but I'm not leaving until I see you.

196
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:18,592
Skyler, please.

197
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,352
Just you.

198
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,647
Not Hank.

199
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,654
Tell me Hank is crazy.

200
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:44,201
Tell me he doesn't know
what he's talking about.

201
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,500
You gotta give me something, Skyler.

202
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,253
Anything to help me understand.

203
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:57,631
It can't be true.

204
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,686
Oh, my God.

205
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,659
How long have you known?

206
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:31,499
Hank said that when you walked
into the pool, that's when you knew.

207
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:33,334
When you had your...

208
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:41,467
But not then. Before that.

209
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:47,431
Since Gus Fring?

210
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:52,353
The money.

211
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:55,189
All that money that Walt made

212
00:21:56,399 --> 00:21:58,901
when you bought your car wash.

213
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:05,074
And your whole gambling story.

214
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:09,870
- That was a lie.
- I...

215
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,416
Did you know then?

216
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,424
You had to.

217
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:28,097
Skyler...

218
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:37,356
did you know since before Hank was shot?

219
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:43,279
Skyler?

220
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,453
Marie.

221
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:54,373
I am so sorry.

222
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:57,084
You're sorry.

223
00:22:57,251 --> 00:22:58,377
You're...

224
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:00,463
I'm sick of...

225
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:06,760
You won't talk. You won't talk to Hank

226
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:10,347
because you think that Walt
is going to get away with this.

227
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,102
Oh, God.

228
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,661
Come on, baby. Come on.

229
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:35,581
- Let's go.
- Marie. Marie. Hey.

230
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:38,083
What are you doing?
Hey, what are you doing?

231
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,378
- She's coming with us.
- No, she is not. Give her back to me.

232
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:42,796
Marie.

233
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:46,467
Hank. Hank, help! Hank!

234
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:49,803
You are not leaving this house
with my daughter.

235
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,555
Give her back to me.

236
00:23:51,722 --> 00:23:54,058
- Marie, give her back to me.
- Stop it.

237
00:23:54,225 --> 00:23:55,434
You're scaring her.

238
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:57,811
- Give her back.
- I'm trying to protect her.

239
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:01,148
- I'm her mother.
- She's not gonna live in this madhouse!

240
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:04,235
You don't know what you're
talking about. Give her back.

241
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:06,451
- Marie.
- Listen, I will call the police.

242
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:10,074
- You call them. You call them, Skyler.
- I will. Give me my baby.

243
00:24:10,241 --> 00:24:12,701
- Marie, put her down.
- You can't take her away.

244
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,828
- Marie.
- Give me my baby.

245
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:17,873
- We are not leaving without her.
- Give me my baby now!

246
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:19,750
Marie!

247
00:24:20,543 --> 00:24:21,877
Do it now.

248
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:26,674
Give her back.

249
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:32,221
That's right. It's okay. It's okay.

250
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:36,016
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

251
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:39,853
It's okay. It's okay. I got you.

252
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:46,944
Okay, Mama has you now.

253
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:50,239
Mama has you now. Mama has you.

254
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:53,117
It's okay. It's okay.

255
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:00,207
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

256
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:02,001
It's okay.

257
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,315
You have to get him.

258
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:08,335
Thirty-four, 59, 20, 106, 36, 52.

259
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:13,131
Thirty-four, 59, 20, 106, 36, 52.

260
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:21,223
Thirty-four, 59, 20, 106, 36, 52.

261
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:27,271
Thirty-four, 59, 20, 106, 36, 52.

262
00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:34,236
Thirty-four, 59, 20, 106, 36, 52.

263
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:04,641
Walt.

264
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:20,616
Where have you been?

265
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:24,786
Oh, my God.

266
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:29,958
What happened?

267
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:44,181
You moved the money, didn't you?
You buried it somewhere.

268
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:48,143
Did you get my messages?

269
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:52,773
I told Hank nothing.

270
00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:59,613
Walt, I swear I didn't.

271
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:03,575
Say something.

272
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:07,621
Please.

273
00:29:12,793 --> 00:29:13,835
Oh, my God.

274
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:17,047
Walt. Walt.

275
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,526
Hey.

276
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:48,036
How...? How long was I out?

277
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:50,831
Four or five hours.

278
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:54,584
How are you feeling?

279
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:04,010
It's true.

280
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:09,224
The cancer is back.

281
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:21,486
Is this it?

282
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:36,168
Does that make you happy?

283
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:42,007
I can't remember
the last time I was happy.

284
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:54,311
Just tell me.

285
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:59,816
I know you talked with Hank.

286
00:31:00,484 --> 00:31:02,402
I know you made a deal.

287
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:06,531
Skyler, I'll make this easy.

288
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:12,704
I'll give myself up
if you promise me one thing.

289
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:16,583
You keep the money.

290
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:19,628
Never speak of it.

291
00:31:21,171 --> 00:31:23,048
Never give it up.

292
00:31:23,757 --> 00:31:26,301
You pass it on to our children.

293
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:29,971
Give them everything.

294
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,851
Would you do that?

295
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:39,981
Please.

296
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:45,946
Please don't let me
have done all this for nothing.

297
00:31:57,666 --> 00:32:00,043
How did Hank find out?

298
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:03,630
Did somebody talk?

299
00:32:03,797 --> 00:32:06,299
No, no one talked.

300
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:10,428
It was me.

301
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,350
I screwed up.

302
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:22,983
The way Hank talks...

303
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:28,029
he's got his suspicions.

304
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:33,243
Not much else.

305
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:42,586
You can't give yourself up
without giving up the money.

306
00:32:43,837 --> 00:32:46,423
It's the way this works, Walt.

307
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:50,552
So maybe our best move here...

308
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:54,639
is to stay quiet.

309
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:35,180
Okay, you can take it off now.

310
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:04,876
All right, what's so important
you had to come way out here?

311
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:11,091
The amount of money I'm bringing in,
I deserve to see why it's all going wrong.

312
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:14,010
You an expert on meth labs now?

313
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:16,680
You gonna tell us
how to fix our operation?

314
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:20,976
And what if I can help?
What will it hurt to show me?

315
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,812
I don't like my time being wasted.

316
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:28,817
Well, I'm here, and 10 minutes
is a small sacrifice

317
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:31,695
when we're talking about
a $50 million shortfall.

318
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:34,572
So?

319
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:09,274
Safe to come down?

320
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:11,609
Yeah. You're good.

321
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:21,619
Ladies first.

322
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:51,274
- Okay, now you've seen it.
- Yeah, now I've seen it.

323
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,193
What?

324
00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:57,906
Well, how about we start with it's filthy.

325
00:35:58,073 --> 00:36:01,076
What are you, my mother?
What filthy? It's just dimly lit.

326
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:04,954
Do you seriously think this is up to
the standards of your predecessor?

327
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:07,207
Because it's not. Not even close.

328
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:10,210
Well, the product we're making,
it's selling just fine.

329
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:12,670
Heisenberg's standards
don't matter anymore.

330
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:16,257
To whom?
A bunch of scabby Arizona tweakers?

331
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:21,012
They matter to my buyer in the Czech
Republic, therefore, they matter to me.

332
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:25,100
Look, I cannot move what this person
is making if it's substandard.

333
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:28,436
And it is. It just is. No offense.

334
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:31,981
- If you can do better, do better.
- I don't know what to tell you.

335
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:34,109
You tried to get the man back, right?

336
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:37,028
He said no, so...
I mean, what do you want me to do?

337
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,322
Todd. Use Todd again.

338
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:43,284
Look, he learned from him, all right?

339
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:46,412
At least Todd's first two cooks
were at 74 percent.

340
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:48,540
On his third cook, he started a fire.

341
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:51,709
Look, I tried Heisenberg's way.
It didn't work out.

342
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:55,213
I wanna cook in my territory.
I wanna use guys that I trust

343
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,257
not Todd, who I don't.

344
00:36:57,423 --> 00:37:00,969
And that's the end of the conversation
as far as I'm concerned.

345
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:08,226
I really wish you'd have
given him a chance.

346
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:10,562
Hey. We have a problem.

347
00:37:13,523 --> 00:37:14,899
You stay here.

348
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:48,558
Get down!

349
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:13,666
Hello? Ma'am, you okay?

350
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,090
Hello?

351
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:36,064
Safe to come up whenever you want.

352
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,202
I...

353
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:52,205
I don't want to see.

354
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:54,457
Okay.

355
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:58,586
Cool, so I guess maybe...

356
00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:01,673
Maybe just close your eyes.

357
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:13,685
Okay.

358
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:15,478
This way.

359
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:21,234
To the right.

360
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:33,288
Are you kidding me with this?

361
00:39:34,831 --> 00:39:36,332
Uncle Jack.

362
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:51,055
Fire in the hole.

363
00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:54,684
It's okay. Sorry about that.

364
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:58,104
It's cool, lady.

365
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:10,408
Okay, boys, let's take it all.
Let's get everything.

366
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:38,603
Hey.

367
00:40:40,147 --> 00:40:41,606
You

368
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:44,151
going into work today?

369
00:40:46,528 --> 00:40:49,573
You're kidding, right?

370
00:40:54,536 --> 00:40:56,246
What about you?

371
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:01,793
Are you going to the office?

372
00:41:05,047 --> 00:41:07,090
You have to tell them, Hank.

373
00:41:08,258 --> 00:41:09,551
Today.

374
00:41:09,718 --> 00:41:13,388
Marie, I just... I just don't have it yet.

375
00:41:14,306 --> 00:41:17,601
The piece I need to prove it all,
it's just not here.

376
00:41:17,768 --> 00:41:19,561
Then let them help you.

377
00:41:19,728 --> 00:41:21,480
Tell Steve, tell Ramey.

378
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:25,525
You've got enough to get them
to believe your story at least.

379
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:27,527
Put the whole DEA on it.

380
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:30,238
That's how this is supposed to work,
right?

381
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:31,656
No.

382
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,533
No?

383
00:41:34,242 --> 00:41:37,162
What no? What are you,
Lone Wolf McQuade?

384
00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:40,040
- Look, baby...
- You've gotta go in with this, Hank.

385
00:41:40,207 --> 00:41:43,085
Look, the day I go in with this

386
00:41:45,045 --> 00:41:47,506
that's the last day of my career,
all right?

387
00:41:47,964 --> 00:41:52,552
I'm going to have to walk in there,
look those people in the eye,

388
00:41:53,345 --> 00:41:56,640
and admit that the person
I've been chasing the past year

389
00:41:56,807 --> 00:41:59,601
is my own brother-in-law.

390
00:42:04,231 --> 00:42:06,149
It's over for me.

391
00:42:09,736 --> 00:42:13,532
Ten seconds after I tell this story,
I'm a civilian.

392
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:18,286
And then how can we help Skyler
if she comes to her senses?

393
00:42:19,788 --> 00:42:21,706
When I go in there

394
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:27,504
I'm bringing proof, not suspicions.

395
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:34,761
I can be the man who caught him,
at least.

396
00:42:34,928 --> 00:42:36,346
What if you wait,

397
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:39,099
and they catch Walt without you?

398
00:42:39,266 --> 00:42:42,853
If they find out that you knew
and you said nothing?

399
00:42:43,645 --> 00:42:46,314
Hank, wouldn't you go to jail too?

400
00:42:54,656 --> 00:42:55,907
Hey, Hank. Welcome back.

401
00:42:57,325 --> 00:42:58,702
Morning.

402
00:42:59,244 --> 00:43:00,954
- Hey.
- Hey, boss.

403
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:05,584
- How you doing, Hank?
- Hey.

404
00:43:21,558 --> 00:43:23,351
Hey. Look who's back.

405
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:25,604
I had to see it with my own eyes.

406
00:43:25,812 --> 00:43:28,481
- How you doing?
- Good. Yeah, yeah. You miss me?

407
00:43:28,648 --> 00:43:31,026
Miss you? Like my balls
miss jock itch, maybe.

408
00:43:31,193 --> 00:43:32,986
Yeah? I didn't know you had balls.

409
00:43:33,153 --> 00:43:35,697
All right, don't make me sorry
I stopped by here.

410
00:43:35,864 --> 00:43:38,700
Anyway, you got a budget meeting
in an hour

411
00:43:38,867 --> 00:43:42,579
then a meet-and-greet with
the new prescription task force guys.

412
00:43:42,746 --> 00:43:47,918
All right. Hey, you know, listen.

413
00:43:48,084 --> 00:43:51,963
Let's see if we can get
that budget meeting pushed,

414
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:57,302
and instead see if you could set up
a conference call with Ramey.

415
00:43:57,469 --> 00:43:58,845
What for?

416
00:43:59,012 --> 00:44:03,683
Just a "getting back up to speed" thing,
you know, for me.

417
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,019
All right. You got it.

418
00:44:06,186 --> 00:44:09,648
Oh, hey. Did you hear
about that money thing?

419
00:44:10,523 --> 00:44:11,983
No, what money thing?

420
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:16,404
Oh, you're gonna love this.
It involves your old pal Jesse Pinkman.

421
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:18,573
Pinkman?

422
00:44:19,032 --> 00:44:22,911
I'll give you this.
Jesse, you're never boring.

423
00:44:23,078 --> 00:44:24,663
Not boring at all.

424
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:28,833
So come on, buddy, share with us.

425
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,004
Why were you tossing
millions of dollars all over Albuquerque?

426
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:37,217
I promise you we can hold out
just as long as you can.

427
00:44:37,384 --> 00:44:40,637
That's a fact. I got a bladder
the size of a hot water bottle.

428
00:44:40,804 --> 00:44:44,182
Man, all that cash. I wouldn't
be able to stop talking about it.

429
00:44:44,349 --> 00:44:47,602
I know. But I don't think
I'd be tossing it out my car window.

430
00:44:47,769 --> 00:44:51,231
Yeah. My take-home doesn't allow
for that whole Robin Hood thing.

431
00:44:51,398 --> 00:44:54,192
- But apparently Jesse is raking it in.
- Yes, indeed.

432
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:58,196
I'm sure he's got a perfectly reasonable
explanation for where he got it.

433
00:44:58,363 --> 00:44:59,906
Sure. He found it.

434
00:45:00,073 --> 00:45:03,618
- Or won it in a card game, maybe.
- That's it. Won it in a card game.

435
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:05,453
Lucky night at the casino.

436
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:08,707
Jesse, did you have a lucky night?

437
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:16,339
Okay. Jesse, we're gonna let you
gather your thoughts,

438
00:45:16,506 --> 00:45:19,217
so we can continue
this stimulating conversation.

439
00:45:19,384 --> 00:45:23,680
Can we get you anything?
Coffee? A soda?

440
00:45:23,847 --> 00:45:28,018
- Right.
- Yeah. Thought not.

441
00:45:38,403 --> 00:45:40,947
I have a history with Jesse Pinkman,

442
00:45:41,114 --> 00:45:45,076
and I think he can be helpful to me
on another active investigation.

443
00:45:45,243 --> 00:45:48,997
Look, I'm only asking
for a couple minutes here.

444
00:45:49,247 --> 00:45:53,918
You said he wasn't talking?
Let me tell you, that kid hates my guts.

445
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:55,920
Despises me, okay?

446
00:45:56,087 --> 00:45:59,257
Maybe I can get him cranked up
enough that he starts yapping.

447
00:45:59,424 --> 00:46:04,888
Then you guys go in, get what you need
from the little shit-stain, finish him off.

448
00:46:05,263 --> 00:46:10,143
Gives me anything useful while
he's with me, I'll share it, 100 percent.

449
00:46:11,144 --> 00:46:13,605
I could use a smoke break.
Yeah. How about you?

450
00:46:13,772 --> 00:46:18,193
Yeah. Maybe you could keep an eye on our
suspect for us, just for a few minutes.

451
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,695
Absolutely. I can do that.

452
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:21,988
Okay.

453
00:46:22,155 --> 00:46:23,656
All right, guys.
