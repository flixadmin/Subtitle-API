1
00:00:03,212 --> 00:00:06,673
Gotta say, when you first brought
her in, I had my doubts.

2
00:00:06,882 --> 00:00:09,968
But your little darling's got nine lives.

3
00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:16,558
Rear-wheel assembly took the brunt
of the impact. So...

4
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:18,310
Yeah.

5
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:21,063
CV shaft, boots, joints, axle...

6
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:23,607
Replaced all of it. No way around it.

7
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:26,443
I went aftermarket
on most of the parts here.

8
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:29,070
You want me to swap in factory parts,
that's fine.

9
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:32,449
But using aftermarket's the only way
we'll keep it under Blue Book,

10
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:35,118
and on the insurance company's
dime, okay?

11
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:37,162
Nothing beats free.

12
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:42,042
Swapped out your air filter,
topped off your fluids.

13
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:44,544
Didn't have to replace
the windshield this time.

14
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:46,380
I know, right?

15
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:50,425
Oh, and I noticed you had
some sort of gunky buildup

16
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:52,135
in the front end here.

17
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:54,972
First, I had no idea
what I was looking at.

18
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,080
Then I remembered you had me replace

19
00:00:57,182 --> 00:01:01,562
that front fender a few months back
when you ran over that deer.

20
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,190
We went at it with the steam hose,
cleaned it up for you.

21
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:07,901
Hardest part was the paint.

22
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:11,530
Fern green. Interesting tint.

23
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:12,906
Anything else?

24
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:16,285
That's it. Zero balance, like I said.

25
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:18,495
Sign here, you're good to go.

26
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:23,250
People like to joke,

27
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:26,169
but I really, really like this car.

28
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:28,046
She's sturdy as all hell.

29
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:31,341
I'm betting you get
another 200,000 miles out of her.

30
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:54,531
Hey, Benny.

31
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,744
What would you give me for it?

32
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,038
- What's the Blue Book, you mean?
- No.

33
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:04,541
I mean, what will
you pay me for this car?

34
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:08,295
- Well, I'm not really looking for...
- A hundred dollars?

35
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,089
Fifty?

36
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:14,175
Insurance company just shelled out
1900 for the parts alone.

37
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,927
Then it's a bargain.

38
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:19,514
You give me 50 bucks,
and she's all yours.

39
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:21,308
You sure about this?

40
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:22,726
Sure as shooting.

41
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:25,312
I'll check the register.

42
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,481
Dad?

43
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:30,317
Fifty bucks? Are you crazy?

44
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:27,642
{\an8}- Gotta be kidding me.
<i>- Lydia?</i>

45
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,544
{\an8}Oh, Christ.

46
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,217
I'm at work right now.

47
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:01,802
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

48
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,860
<i>This is a heads-up. You got visitors.</i>

49
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,808
Visitors? What...? You mean today?

50
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,936
{\an8}<i>I mean 30 seconds.</i>

51
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:17,108
Come in.

52
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:21,154
Ms. Rodarte-Quayle?

53
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:25,742
Agent Hank Schrader,
Agent Steve Gomez, DEA.

54
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:29,037
We met briefly in Albuquerque.

55
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:30,789
{\an8}Yes, we did.

56
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,124
{\an8}What can I do for you?

57
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,203
There. The foreman.

58
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:13,665
{\an8}Navy pants, powder-blue shirt.

59
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,803
{\an8}Hey, buddy.

60
00:06:58,001 --> 00:06:59,101
{\an8}<i>- Yeah?</i>
- They got Ron.

61
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:00,670
{\an8}Ron's done.

62
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,297
{\an8}<i>Okay.</i>

63
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,423
No. No.

64
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:06,593
Not okay, Mike.

65
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,845
Not okay. The...

66
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:14,142
The look he just gave me was
the very antithesis of "okay," okay?

67
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:15,602
<i>Breathe, Lydia.</i>

68
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,360
<i>No one's talking to the police.</i>

69
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,690
I just had like 14 DEA agents

70
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:23,599
barge into my office,
screaming and yelling at me,

71
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:26,738
and they were swarming
all over the warehouse, okay?

72
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:28,490
The warehouse.

73
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:32,243
Besides, Ron was my guy. Remember?
I don't have a guy anymore.

74
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,162
Ron fixed security, pulled the barrels,
drove the truck.

75
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:39,626
You can't expect me to do that stuff.
I mean, let's be realistic.

76
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:46,341
Mike, this is crazy.

77
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,177
<i>I'll send a new guy.</i>

78
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:15,996
<i>You're crazy.</i>

79
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:18,081
My car almost has 500 horsepower.

80
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:21,251
- It would totally smoke...
- Horsepower isn't everything.

81
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:22,544
Don't you know that?

82
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:26,881
{\an8}You have to factor in drag
and torque and suspension,

83
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,842
{\an8}and weight of the car.

84
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,350
{\an8}One more factor
that you're not thinking about:

85
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:34,180
{\an8}The experience of the driver.
I totally got you there.

86
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:36,964
{\an8}- Please. Please. You drive like a geezer.
- I got you.

87
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:38,810
{\an8}Really? I drive like a gee...

88
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,980
{\an8}Tell me, can a geezer do donuts?
I don't think so.

89
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,838
- Bullshit you ever did donuts.
- Watch your language.

90
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:46,526
- And, yes, I did.
- Seriously?

91
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:48,569
{\an8}Yes, seriously. And if you show me

92
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:51,113
{\an8}just a modicum of respect,
maybe I'll teach you.

93
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,825
{\an8}- Yeah? Yes?
- No. No, I won't. I take that back.

94
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:57,162
{\an8}- Yes. Yes. No. You're saying yes.
- Just a joke. I'm just...

95
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,820
{\an8}No! No, no. That was kidding.

96
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,957
{\an8}- We didn't shake on it. No.
- Yes. Yes.

97
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,866
- We are now.
- That doesn't count!

98
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:06,296
I know you don't approve.

99
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:10,592
But mine

100
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,012
we'll call a birthday present to myself.

101
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:16,473
And Junior's...

102
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:22,604
People will just chalk that up
as me being a softy.

103
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:26,441
And besides

104
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:29,360
I didn't actually buy either one.

105
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:33,073
They're both leases.
So it all fits our story.

106
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,116
Okay?

107
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,381
{\an8}We can afford it now.

108
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,470
{\an8}You're back at it?

109
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:58,139
{\an8}Well, yeah.

110
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:02,102
{\an8}We have to make up that 600,000 we lost.

111
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:15,532
What do you think about boarding school?

112
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:18,201
Boarding school?

113
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:20,829
For who? For Junior?

114
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:24,165
Yeah. There's this place
in northern Arizona,

115
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:28,419
and it's supposed to be
one of the top 10 in the country.

116
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:31,714
He's a year away from college.

117
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:34,592
Why on earth would we do that?

118
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:38,012
I... I don't know. I just...

119
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:41,057
Just thinking about the kids.

120
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,810
Holly too?

121
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:46,104
Where are we sending our 8-month-old?

122
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,856
Peace Corps?

123
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:52,068
No. I just...

124
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:58,741
A new environment might be good for them.

125
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,077
What does that mean?

126
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:05,505
What's wrong with their environment?

127
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:09,961
Skyler.

128
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,382
What's wrong with their environment?

129
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,012
Nothing.

130
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:28,229
Hey.

131
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:34,569
Listen, I know these last few weeks
have been rough.

132
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:39,490
The threat to Hank
and this whole thing with Beneke.

133
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:43,244
But there's absolutely nothing,

134
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:46,080
for you to be afraid of anymore, okay?

135
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:49,292
I mean, clear sailing from here on out.
I promise.

136
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:57,842
You know, I want us to try and start
looking forward to things again.

137
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:01,638
Speaking of which, my birthday.

138
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,975
I don't know...
I don't know what you have planned,

139
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:09,520
and with everything
that's been going on lately

140
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:12,528
I'd understand if you haven't
even given it a thought.

141
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:15,860
But I think

142
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,655
a little celebration might be good.

143
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,782
For all of us.

144
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:24,619
You know, a birthday party.

145
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,538
What do you think?

146
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,335
Yeah?

147
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:34,212
Okay.

148
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,173
And maybe, if I may be so bold

149
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:41,344
chocolate cake with chocolate icing?

150
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,309
Life is good, Skyler.

151
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:10,123
- Thank you.
- Hey, Mom, you forgot something.

152
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:12,500
Dad's bacon.

153
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:13,959
That's okay. I can do it.

154
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:16,588
No. Mom has to.

155
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:22,177
Well, it is sort of a tradition.

156
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:28,558
Watch this, Holly.

157
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:31,019
Watch what she does with bacon.

158
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,605
Watch. Watch this.

159
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:38,443
What is she doing?
What is she doing?

160
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:45,325
That's a pretty small "1."

161
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,452
Kind of is.

162
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,703
Just a little.

163
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:54,626
Now you're talking.

164
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,086
- No. No.
- Good move.

165
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:58,671
- No.
- No, no, no. It's good.

166
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:00,298
Very good. Family teamwork.

167
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,092
Making sacrifices. Very important.

168
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:05,970
- Happy birthday, Dad.
- Thank you, buddy.

169
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,347
You want some?

170
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,305
Guy's some piece of work, isn't he?

171
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:13,352
Six feet under and half a face,
he's still screwing with us.

172
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:15,271
So, what's next?

173
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,398
I don't know. I don't know.

174
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:20,025
This Madrigal thing seems hinky,
though, you know?

175
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,459
We got Burgermeister Meisterburger
in Germany...

176
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,782
and 5000 miles away, you got this guy.

177
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:30,416
There's gotta be someone in the middle,
you know? Someone we're missing.

178
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:36,376
What about that Lydia what's-her-name?

179
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,234
Lady Banjo Eyes at the warehouse?

180
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:40,505
In this world? No way.

181
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,090
Too uptight. Too together.

182
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:43,383
Maybe.

183
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:46,719
She was wearing mismatched shoes.

184
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:48,972
How together can she be?

185
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:55,645
Gentlemen, how goes it with Fring?

186
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:59,148
You know, just working through the grief.

187
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:01,985
How soon before you submit a final?

188
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:05,196
Well, we've been kicking around
some ideas.

189
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,305
Had you asked a couple of weeks ago

190
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,700
I'd have said
this was a mop-up job, but...

191
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:12,829
{\an8}- But?
- None of Fring's crew is talking to us.

192
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:15,456
I mean, not a peep,
no matter how hard we squeeze.

193
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,167
Makes it likely there's somebody
keeping them in line.

194
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:21,379
Our money is on this guy,
Michael Ehrmantraut.

195
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:24,507
He's Fring's head
of "corporate security."

196
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:27,666
- He's a definite hard case.
- Now, we're gonna stay on him.

197
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:30,763
We're putting together
a surveillance team as we speak. Okay?

198
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:32,432
The other thing is...

199
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,309
This may be unrelated,

200
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:37,853
but the blue meth is making
a bit of a comeback. Tell him, Gomey.

201
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,356
Yeah. Some small amounts
on the street-side pulls.

202
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,317
Lab's telling us it's the same stuff.

203
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:44,818
I mean, it could be
old inventory leaking out,

204
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:48,156
or it could be somebody's rebooting

205
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:52,118
using Fring's former cooks
to set up a new operation.

206
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:53,877
I thought we had Fring's cooks.

207
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:55,997
The unsubs in the lab fire.

208
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,415
Thought maybe one of them
was your Heisenberg.

209
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:01,878
Yeah. Maybe. I don't know.

210
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,839
Like I said,
there's still a lot of questions.

211
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:09,385
Agent Gomez, could you give us a moment?

212
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:11,429
Yeah.

213
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:19,437
Hank, I gotta say,
your work here has been stellar.

214
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,481
Really first-rate.

215
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,107
Thank you, sir.

216
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:26,569
So much so that I'm wondering
if it's time you made a change.

217
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:29,781
You know I have to get back to El Paso.

218
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,283
This office needs an ASAC,

219
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:35,192
and I'm thinking we should be
promoting from within.

220
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:37,320
If you were to put in an application,

221
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:40,750
and I recommend that you do,
you will get the job.

222
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,754
I have no doubt this D.O. would be
well served with you at the helm.

223
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,424
That's...

224
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:51,344
I'm not sure what to say.

225
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:54,722
It's a big step up.
It's not without its headaches.

226
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:57,016
The politics may take
some getting used to.

227
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,400
You'd be overseeing every case
in the office,

228
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,772
so you'd need to reassign
all your day-to-days, Fring included.

229
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:05,608
Much as I hate losing a good field man

230
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:08,317
that's the job,
and you need to be okay with it.

231
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:11,531
What do you say, Hank?

232
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,700
You want it?

233
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:21,457
Well, considering my wife
would murder me if I said "no"...

234
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,378
Yeah. I want it.

235
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,505
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

236
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:41,144
Can you finish up for me?

237
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:43,438
It's... It's my birthday.

238
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:46,315
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

239
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:51,404
I probably have a birthday party
waiting for me, you know, so...

240
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:54,365
Yeah. Cool. Yeah, no problem.

241
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,535
Hey, happy birthday.

242
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,204
Thanks. Thanks.

243
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:25,563
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey.

244
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:34,947
Where's your mom?

245
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:36,782
Kitchen.

246
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:44,540
Hey.

247
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:46,667
Oh, hey.

248
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:53,549
So, what's the plan?

249
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:56,427
Hank and Marie are on their way.

250
00:18:56,677 --> 00:19:01,057
Roast chicken and potatoes for dinner,
rocky road for dessert,

251
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:04,936
and chocolate cake, as requested.

252
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:21,410
What's up?

253
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,913
Me?

254
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,748
Nothing.

255
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:30,211
Thought you'd be more jazzed
about the new job.

256
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,755
No. What...? No. I am.

257
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:35,174
- Baby, I'm so proud of you.
- Yeah, yeah. Okay.

258
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:38,177
- Sorry, sorry.
- I believe you. Just don't kill us here.

259
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:44,976
Marie, you've been moping around
the last few days.

260
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,187
Marie?

261
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:51,899
What's up?

262
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:55,861
- Marie, come on.
- I'm sorry. I...

263
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:58,614
I made a promise to someone.

264
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:01,576
To who?

265
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:06,831
- Who?
- Your brother-in-law.

266
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:14,380
- Are you gonna give me a hint at least?
- It involves infidelity. That's all I'll say.

267
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:20,553
Oh, shit. I knew it.

268
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:25,015
Knew what? What did you...?
What did you know?

269
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:28,685
Well, I mean, I didn't know it, but I've
been, you know, saying it forever.

270
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:31,063
Walt's second cell phone, you know?

271
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:34,025
Sorry, babe, but I was way ahead of you
on this one.

272
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:36,819
Way ahead of me.

273
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,991
Well, it wasn't Walt.

274
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,413
Skyler?

275
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,793
No way.

276
00:20:58,299 --> 00:20:59,342
Hey.

277
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:02,094
- Hey! There she is.
- Hey! Hi!

278
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:03,471
- Hey!
- Hey, buddy.

279
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,266
Hey, pal.
Welcome. Welcome. Come on in.

280
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:09,935
Happy birthday. Hi.

281
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:12,229
I'm in the center lane going about 60.

282
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:15,066
I had no choice but to just tear butt
out of there.

283
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,401
Just: So sweet.

284
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,660
Highway patrol's
gonna be sweet on it too.

285
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:21,738
Gonna get their ticket quota in a month.

286
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:24,972
You'll help me out, right, Uncle Hank,
now that you run the DEA?

287
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:28,704
Oh, yeah. For my spoiled-brat,
car-wash-millionaire nephew?

288
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:32,249
Sure. I'll make sure you get
a cell with a view.

289
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,001
All right.

290
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,961
Well, I'm out of here.

291
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,213
Okay.

292
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:39,298
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you, buddy.

293
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:41,509
Congratulations again, Uncle Hank.

294
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:42,760
Thanks.

295
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,179
- I'll see y'all later.
- All right.

296
00:21:45,388 --> 00:21:46,806
- Bye. Be safe.
- Have fun.

297
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,516
- Drive safely, okay?
- I do.

298
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:51,435
- Slow down.
- Never.

299
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:01,821
A hell of a couple cars there, Walt.

300
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:05,616
Honey, for my next birthday,
I'm gonna take a page here from Walt,

301
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:07,325
and buy myself a jet plane.

302
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:10,621
Maybe I overdid it a little.

303
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,530
But with these new lease rates...

304
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:16,711
I mean, they're mighty attractive. Yeah.

305
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:26,721
Great dinner, Skyler.

306
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:29,724
Those were some bad-ass
whipped potatoes, I'll tell you.

307
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:32,351
You have to tell me
how you get all the lumps out.

308
00:22:32,435 --> 00:22:33,602
How do you do that?

309
00:22:34,729 --> 00:22:36,605
A potato ricer.

310
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:40,192
A ricer? You don't hand-mash?

311
00:22:41,444 --> 00:22:42,945
No.

312
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:54,665
- Well...
- Boy, it has...

313
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:57,835
It has been quite a year, huh?

314
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,171
Do you know that

315
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:03,174
it's almost exactly a year ago

316
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,009
that I got my diagnosis?

317
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,802
- Jesus. Yeah, right?
- Yeah.

318
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:10,306
- It seems like longer, doesn't it?
- Yeah. No. It's...

319
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:13,768
One year ago tomorrow.

320
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,562
The day after my 50th.

321
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:21,358
Honestly never thought
I'd make it this far.

322
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:25,070
With the cancer and surgery,

323
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:27,907
and Hank being shot...

324
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:29,575
It just...

325
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,244
So many dark days.

326
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,287
Well...

327
00:23:34,497 --> 00:23:36,791
There's Marie's talking pillow.

328
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:38,751
Remember that?

329
00:23:40,461 --> 00:23:42,046
It was effective.

330
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:45,424
Boy, I did not want to get any treatment.

331
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:51,263
I think I was too scared,

332
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:53,766
or too angry or...

333
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:56,894
I don't know. I just wanted to quit.

334
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:02,566
But you guys...
You got me through it somehow.

335
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:04,819
Kept me going.

336
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:09,907
And that happened again
and again and again.

337
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,451
I mean, there were times

338
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:15,663
when I was sure I was done for.

339
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:20,793
But then someone or something

340
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,546
would come through for me.

341
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,633
God. And Skyler, I can't...

342
00:24:27,842 --> 00:24:31,011
Honey, remember
that first week of chemotherapy?

343
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,514
That night on the bathroom floor?

344
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:35,599
What you said to me?

345
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:39,854
I was so sick.

346
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:42,940
It was rough going at first.

347
00:24:43,566 --> 00:24:45,484
But Skyler...

348
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:47,903
She was right there, of course

349
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:50,781
putting wet washcloths on my forehead.

350
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,950
And she's singing to me.

351
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:55,911
And this would go on and on

352
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,622
day after day.

353
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:02,459
And I remember I was lying
on the floor of the bathroom

354
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:06,964
because the tile felt
nice and cool, you know?

355
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:09,800
And my head was in Skyler's lap,

356
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:13,053
and I was just asking her

357
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:16,348
if this could all be over.

358
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,810
It was too hard. It was...

359
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:21,520
I just wanted it stopped.

360
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:24,732
Skyler, isn't that freezing?

361
00:25:27,818 --> 00:25:29,612
Hey-o. Pool party.

362
00:25:30,821 --> 00:25:32,405
What are you doing, Skyler?

363
00:25:32,615 --> 00:25:35,242
What is she doing? Walt?

364
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:38,037
Hey, Sky, maybe it's time to get out now.

365
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:39,412
What do you think?

366
00:25:39,622 --> 00:25:41,790
Skyler, Hank asked you a question.

367
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:45,085
You need to get out... Skyler!

368
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:47,838
She's gonna come up, right?

369
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:49,882
She has to.

370
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,141
Skyler!

371
00:26:13,988 --> 00:26:16,074
Oh, my God.

372
00:26:16,282 --> 00:26:18,701
Wha...? Okay.

373
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:22,038
Okay. It's gotta be...

374
00:26:25,416 --> 00:26:27,168
Nope.

375
00:26:29,545 --> 00:26:30,630
Okay.

376
00:26:30,838 --> 00:26:33,716
Come on!
How am I supposed to...?

377
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:48,398
Hey.

378
00:26:48,606 --> 00:26:50,191
Wait.

379
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,986
Wait, wait. Who are you?

380
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:55,738
I'm the... I'm the guy.
So where's the...?

381
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,699
Hold on. Hold on.

382
00:26:57,907 --> 00:26:59,826
Who sent you?

383
00:27:00,034 --> 00:27:02,578
Who sent me? Who do you think?

384
00:27:02,786 --> 00:27:05,623
No. I'm asking you.

385
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:07,875
Mike.

386
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:11,754
And this Mike person...

387
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:13,464
What's his last name?

388
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:16,718
Lady, I just got off a plane
from New Mexico,

389
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:21,180
and I got a 900-mile drive back.
That's 14 hours if I don't stop.

390
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:24,976
So the sooner we do this,
the sooner it's done.

391
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,983
Ehrmantraut.

392
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:34,944
Okay? Satisfied?

393
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:40,923
<i>Sorry, but I'm not gonna apologize
for being careful.</i>

394
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:43,410
With all that's been happening,
for all I knew

395
00:27:43,494 --> 00:27:45,579
you were one of those undercover people.

396
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:47,613
So, yeah, I'll take paranoid any day

397
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:50,501
over getting gang-raped by prison guards.

398
00:27:50,834 --> 00:27:53,254
No doubt. So where's the...?

399
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:56,049
{\an8}Up there. Number 22356.

400
00:27:56,257 --> 00:28:00,219
{\an8}That's the one I erased from
the inventory, so it has to be that one.

401
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:02,096
Can you reach it?

402
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:04,891
Yeah, with, like, a forklift.

403
00:28:05,099 --> 00:28:06,142
You got one?

404
00:28:26,412 --> 00:28:28,831
Wait, wait, wait! Stop!

405
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:35,129
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- What?

406
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:38,674
Please tell me
that's not what I think it is.

407
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:59,070
Has anything like this
ever happened before?

408
00:28:59,278 --> 00:29:02,073
No. No, of course not.

409
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:07,120
No, no. I just...

410
00:29:13,167 --> 00:29:18,256
She and I have been having some issues.

411
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:23,761
Yeah, yeah.
I might've heard a little bit about that.

412
00:29:25,012 --> 00:29:27,306
I mean, hey, look,
Marie didn't go into detail.

413
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:31,060
She just, you know, said that,
you know, you guys were

414
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:34,439
having some issues.

415
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:39,902
So, what's the next move?

416
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,614
Might be good to have her talk
to someone.

417
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:47,285
- I agree.
- Yeah.

418
00:29:47,493 --> 00:29:50,371
- I'm gonna get on that first thing.
- Yeah.

419
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,832
There's Marie's guy, Dave.

420
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,543
She seems really happy with him.

421
00:29:56,544 --> 00:30:00,506
Not that Marie's an advertisement
for advanced mental health or anything.

422
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:03,551
You know...

423
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:07,555
I just had no idea
she was taking it this hard.

424
00:30:12,226 --> 00:30:14,395
Some birthday, huh?

425
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:26,657
She's gonna try and get some sleep.

426
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:28,367
Okay.

427
00:30:33,956 --> 00:30:36,000
What was that?

428
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:37,877
I don't know.

429
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:42,089
- I mean, was she trying...?
- No, not in a swimming pool. No.

430
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:45,635
With all of us there?
No, I don't think so.

431
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:49,388
But we both

432
00:30:50,097 --> 00:30:54,268
think that she should talk to someone.

433
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:58,079
I'm gonna get you Dave's number.

434
00:30:58,231 --> 00:30:59,774
Okay.

435
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:05,821
Listen, Walt, I...

436
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:10,201
I can't help but sense
that there may be some issues

437
00:31:10,409 --> 00:31:12,662
between you and Skyler.

438
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:14,872
None of our business, of course.

439
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:17,667
And, Hank, I don't know if you've

440
00:31:18,125 --> 00:31:21,629
- picked up on any of the...
- He knows. He knows I know.

441
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:33,140
These things happen in a marriage,

442
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:35,059
but it isn't unfixable.

443
00:31:35,851 --> 00:31:40,815
I think what would be great is if

444
00:31:41,023 --> 00:31:43,734
you two had some space

445
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:46,946
to work through this stuff.

446
00:31:47,154 --> 00:31:48,739
So...

447
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,201
And keep an open mind here.

448
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:56,330
What if we took the kids for a while?

449
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:59,750
- Took the kids?
- Absolutely.

450
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:03,796
We'll look after them for a day or two,
or however long,

451
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:06,882
and leave you and Skyler

452
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:09,302
to look after each other.

453
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,804
That's very generous of you, Marie,

454
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:16,142
but I... I just don't see
how that's a solution.

455
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:17,852
And, I mean...

456
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:22,523
Besides, Junior and Holly,
that's a lot of work.

457
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:24,191
No, it isn't.

458
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,568
Junior's independent,

459
00:32:25,776 --> 00:32:29,238
and my niece is only the easiest

460
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:32,366
most delicious baby that was ever born.

461
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:36,078
- It'll be fun, right?
- Yeah. Yeah. No, yeah. Yeah.

462
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:39,206
Absolutely. Yeah. It's a good idea.

463
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:41,959
Well, I think it's a great idea.

464
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:46,213
Just the thing for both of you.

465
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:56,265
Marie, this idea...

466
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:59,393
Was it yours?

467
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:02,063
Actually, it was Skyler's.

468
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:10,571
She really needs this, Walt.

469
00:33:12,823 --> 00:33:14,450
Yep.

470
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:25,836
I gave Marie bottles.

471
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:29,131
They'll stop and pick up diapers
along the way.

472
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:32,176
I spoke with Junior on the phone,

473
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,470
and after much discussion

474
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:39,225
he agreed to swing by tomorrow,
pick up some clothes. And so voilà

475
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:41,686
the kids are out of this environment.

476
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:43,771
What a coincidence.

477
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:47,483
I know you're awake.

478
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:53,447
What was that about?

479
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:55,616
Can you explain it?

480
00:33:57,618 --> 00:34:00,871
I don't want the children here anymore.

481
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,998
It isn't safe.

482
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:08,170
Skyler, we have talked
about this repeatedly.

483
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:09,797
It has never been more safe.

484
00:34:10,005 --> 00:34:12,007
"Never been"?

485
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:14,885
A couple weeks ago,
a man was coming to this house

486
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:17,244
to kill us, to murder your entire family.

487
00:34:17,471 --> 00:34:20,099
You were in the crawlspace, screaming.

488
00:34:20,307 --> 00:34:22,059
And I dealt with him. It's over.

489
00:34:22,309 --> 00:34:23,936
It is not.

490
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:26,313
You're right back
in the meth business again.

491
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:29,525
This is different.
Now I'm running things.

492
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:32,445
So wait. Now that you're in charge

493
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:35,698
it's what? It's gonna be
smooth sailing from here on out?

494
00:34:35,906 --> 00:34:37,283
I don't see why not.

495
00:34:37,491 --> 00:34:41,328
I keep the work at work, Skyler,

496
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:44,248
and nothing will ever
impact you or the kids.

497
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:47,293
You don't know that.
You can't make that promise, Walt.

498
00:34:47,501 --> 00:34:50,087
I can promise you that Gus Fring is dead.

499
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:52,548
And he was the threat.
He was the danger.

500
00:34:53,215 --> 00:34:55,176
I thought you were the danger.

501
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,186
Is that what your pool stunt was about?

502
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:07,563
Trying to protect my children from me?

503
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,482
Not just you.

504
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:11,859
There's blood on my hands too.

505
00:35:12,067 --> 00:35:14,904
What blood? Beneke?

506
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:17,448
He's in the hospital because of me.

507
00:35:17,656 --> 00:35:19,241
- No.
- Because of what I did.

508
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,950
Skyler, you can't beat yourself up
over this thing.

509
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:24,830
Please. You didn't set out
to hurt anybody.

510
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:27,499
You made a mistake,
and things got out of control,

511
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:30,669
but you did what you had to
to protect your family. I'm sorry.

512
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:33,672
That doesn't make you a bad person,
it makes you a human being.

513
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:37,426
Stop it, Walt. Just stop.

514
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:40,470
I don't need to hear any
of your bullshit rationales.

515
00:35:40,554 --> 00:35:41,972
I'm in it now.

516
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:44,308
I'm compromised. But I won't...

517
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:47,478
I will not have my children
living in a house

518
00:35:47,686 --> 00:35:51,357
where dealing drugs
and hurting people and killing people

519
00:35:51,565 --> 00:35:54,485
is shrugged off as "shit happens."

520
00:35:54,693 --> 00:35:56,570
We're back at it? Fine.

521
00:35:56,779 --> 00:35:59,532
But the kids stay away, and that's that.

522
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,408
"That's that"? That's what?

523
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:03,410
I got them out of this house.

524
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:06,121
To a sleepover at their aunt and uncle's?

525
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,706
They spend a day or two

526
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:10,917
Junior stays up late watching movies,
and then what happens?

527
00:36:11,001 --> 00:36:13,671
- We'll see.
- No, I'll tell you what happens.

528
00:36:13,879 --> 00:36:17,258
They come home to this house,
to their parents who love them.

529
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:20,052
No. I will not let
our business endanger them.

530
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:21,961
How many times do I have to say

531
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:23,954
- that they are not in...?
- I said no.

532
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:27,184
I swear to God,
I won't have them back here.

533
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:36,527
What are you gonna do to stop it?

534
00:36:38,445 --> 00:36:42,074
Whatever it takes.
Everything in my power.

535
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:44,326
Like what? I mean, specifically.

536
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:46,203
What is your next move?

537
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:48,581
My next move is maybe I hurt myself.

538
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:50,749
Make it clear we need more time.

539
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:53,293
Let Hank and Marie see
we're still struggling.

540
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:57,339
No, more like you're still struggling. So
maybe next time, I have you committed.

541
00:36:57,548 --> 00:37:01,343
Put you in some inpatient facility
while I take care of the kids myself.

542
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:03,721
Is that what you want?

543
00:37:03,929 --> 00:37:07,224
So then maybe I show up
with bruises on my neck

544
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:09,018
give myself a black eye

545
00:37:09,226 --> 00:37:10,895
say that you beat me

546
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:13,731
when you found out about my lover.

547
00:37:15,774 --> 00:37:17,359
I see.

548
00:37:18,652 --> 00:37:20,446
So you want to involve Ted?

549
00:37:20,654 --> 00:37:22,004
Oh, well, that'll be fun

550
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:24,575
bringing the police
up to speed on all of that.

551
00:37:24,783 --> 00:37:27,828
But not as much fun as
telling your 16-year-old son

552
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:30,581
that his father is a wife-beater.

553
00:37:30,789 --> 00:37:33,208
Also not a very good plan.
What else you got?

554
00:37:34,376 --> 00:37:37,726
- I could send Junior away to school.
- Now here's the conversation:

555
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:41,132
"So, honey, I know you've only got
one year left in high school,

556
00:37:41,216 --> 00:37:43,666
but I would love it
if you'd drop everything

557
00:37:43,802 --> 00:37:47,264
leave all your friends behind,
and go to boarding school in Arizona."

558
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:49,850
You have any other ideas?
Because I'm not hearing

559
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,477
a solution to your problem.

560
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:56,857
How are you going to save our kids
from this terrible environment?

561
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:58,817
- I don't...
- What are you gonna do?

562
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:02,112
Run off to France? You gonna
close the curtains, change the locks?

563
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:03,989
This is a joke. Come on, Skyler.

564
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:07,534
You wanna take me on?
You wanna take away my children?

565
00:38:08,827 --> 00:38:11,538
- What's the plan?
- I don't know!

566
00:38:12,122 --> 00:38:14,667
This is the best
I could come up with, okay?

567
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:18,629
I will count every minute
that the kids are away from here

568
00:38:18,837 --> 00:38:20,965
away from you, as a victory.

569
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,634
But you're right.

570
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:26,303
It's a bad plan.

571
00:38:27,137 --> 00:38:31,433
I don't have any of your magic, Walt.

572
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:33,060
I don't know what to do.

573
00:38:33,268 --> 00:38:35,354
I'm a coward.

574
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:39,400
I... I can't go to the police.
I can't stop laundering your money.

575
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:41,527
I can't keep you out of this house.

576
00:38:41,735 --> 00:38:44,488
I can't even keep you out of my bed.

577
00:38:45,781 --> 00:38:48,701
All I can do is wait.

578
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:50,869
That's it. That's the only good option.

579
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:54,623
Hold on, bide my time,

580
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:56,417
and wait.

581
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:01,380
Wait for what?
What are you waiting for?

582
00:39:03,048 --> 00:39:06,176
For the cancer to come back.

583
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:57,145
Yeah?

584
00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:00,857
Okay. Okay.

585
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:03,902
Just relax. I'm coming.

586
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:19,250
Look at that.
You tell me what that looks like.

587
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:22,878
If the DEA's tracking her barrels,
there goes our precursor connection.

588
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:25,298
That's done.
And I'm telling you, these days

589
00:40:25,507 --> 00:40:28,510
chances of getting a new
methylamine hookup is rare, man.

590
00:40:28,718 --> 00:40:30,553
It's like Bigfoot. Like unicorn-rare.

591
00:40:30,637 --> 00:40:34,891
Kid, it's just...
You're giving me heartburn here.

592
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,727
GPS on the bottom of the barrel.

593
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:40,646
Why didn't they put it inside
where nobody would see it?

594
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:42,357
Look, it's inside, it gets wet.

595
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:44,525
They made these things to put under cars.

596
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:46,361
It can get wet.

597
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:50,448
Even by cop standards, this is sloppy.

598
00:40:50,657 --> 00:40:52,033
And the other barrels

599
00:40:52,242 --> 00:40:54,242
they have trackers on the outside too?

600
00:40:54,411 --> 00:40:56,830
I don't know. Probably.

601
00:40:58,206 --> 00:41:00,249
You didn't check
any of the other barrels?

602
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:03,433
No. But that's the only one
we could've taken according to her.

603
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:08,299
Once we spotted it, she freaked out,
I put the barrel back, and we F.O.'d.

604
00:41:08,508 --> 00:41:10,301
Let me ask you something.

605
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:12,846
The person who spotted this

606
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:14,597
was it you or was it her?

607
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:17,183
Lydia. She saw it first.

608
00:41:18,435 --> 00:41:20,228
Okay.

609
00:41:20,437 --> 00:41:21,646
She's dead.

610
00:41:21,855 --> 00:41:23,481
Wait, wait, wait. What?

611
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:26,568
Lydia planted this thing, not the cops.

612
00:41:26,776 --> 00:41:30,279
She's thinking if she makes it look
like her inventory's being watched

613
00:41:30,363 --> 00:41:33,324
that we'll leave her alone
and take our business elsewhere.

614
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:34,659
And she's right.

615
00:41:34,868 --> 00:41:37,120
We will be taking our business elsewhere

616
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,581
right after I leave her alone in a ditch.

617
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:42,389
But wait, hey, if the DEA's
not tracking her stuff

618
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:45,836
that's a good thing, right?
I mean, all we gotta do is tell her

619
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,506
to cut the crap
and keep the methylamine coming.

620
00:41:48,715 --> 00:41:50,508
You don't know this woman like I do.

621
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:53,720
I had a chance to deal with this before,
and I gave her a pass.

622
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:55,722
That's what I get for being sexist.

623
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:59,350
- Now, if you'll excuse me...
- Mike, you can't just...

624
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:01,853
Look, that's our precursor.
We need her.

625
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:05,482
Kid, if we have to ramp down
for a while, so be it.

626
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:09,152
It beats working with a lunatic
who's gonna get us arrested or killed.

627
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:13,740
Look, she didn't seem crazy to me, you
know? She just seemed, like, uptight.

628
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:16,034
And now you're being sexist.

629
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:21,206
Trust me, this woman deserves to die
as much as any man I've ever met.

630
00:42:21,748 --> 00:42:23,166
Wait!

631
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,043
Just wait.

632
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:27,351
What if this really was the cops,
you know?

633
00:42:27,462 --> 00:42:30,173
- And what if you're wrong about her?
- I'm not wrong.

634
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,675
But what if you are?

635
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:36,554
Jesse, your misgivings
have been duly noted.

636
00:42:36,763 --> 00:42:39,265
Now move away from me.

637
00:42:39,474 --> 00:42:41,476
No. This is a voting thing.

638
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:44,646
- I don't think so.
- I vote it's a voting thing.

639
00:42:44,854 --> 00:42:47,106
Mr. White, weigh in here, would you?

640
00:42:47,315 --> 00:42:48,983
What do you think?

641
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:52,695
Mr. White?

642
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:04,040
The methylamine keeps flowing,
no matter what.

643
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:06,960
We are not ramping down.

644
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:09,629
We're just getting started.

645
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:13,174
Nothing stops this train.

646
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:15,468
Nothing.

647
00:43:17,512 --> 00:43:20,723
Hey, yo, Mr. White. Hold up.

648
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:25,937
Hey, I just wanted to say
I liked your idea.

649
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:28,231
You know, it's pretty...

650
00:43:29,232 --> 00:43:31,401
I think it's the way to go.

651
00:43:34,404 --> 00:43:36,489
Oh, hey.

652
00:43:36,698 --> 00:43:40,326
You said it was your birthday, so...

653
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:46,666
I left the receipt in the box
in case you wanna exchange it.

654
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:52,088
Anyway, hey, happy birthday.

655
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:08,855
Hi.

656
00:44:15,987 --> 00:44:19,240
I stopped by Hank and Marie's.

657
00:44:19,699 --> 00:44:23,494
Junior is still asking,
"What is going on?"

658
00:44:23,703 --> 00:44:26,039
Nonstop, very insistently.

659
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:28,249
But everything's okay.

660
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:31,294
They're watching <i>Ratatouille.</i>

661
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:33,963
It's very sweet.

662
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,634
How are you?

663
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:48,102
There's gonna be some more money
coming in soon.

664
00:44:48,311 --> 00:44:49,937
Is that okay?

665
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:53,399
Fine.

666
00:44:53,608 --> 00:44:54,984
Good.

667
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,656
So...

668
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:02,700
You coming to bed?

669
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:29,977
I wanna show you something.

670
00:45:32,313 --> 00:45:34,107
See that watch?

671
00:45:34,691 --> 00:45:36,734
It was a birthday present.

672
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:40,780
The person who gave me this present

673
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:42,740
wanted me dead too.

674
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:45,785
Not that long ago

675
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:49,622
he pointed a gun
right between my eyes, right here,

676
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:52,625
and he threatened to kill me.

677
00:45:54,252 --> 00:45:57,004
He changed his mind about me, Skyler,

678
00:45:58,172 --> 00:46:00,049
and so will you.
