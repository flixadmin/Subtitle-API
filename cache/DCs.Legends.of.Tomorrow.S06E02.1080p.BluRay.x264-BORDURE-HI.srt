1
00:00:05,507 --> 00:00:08,051
So, there are aliens
scattered throughout history.

2
00:00:09,636 --> 00:00:12,138
- [gasps]
- [Nate] Oh...

3
00:00:13,306 --> 00:00:15,767
And on our windshield.

4
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:18,019
- No, no, no!
- [all exclaiming]

5
00:00:18,144 --> 00:00:20,021
- Rory, that was a lead.
- [Spooner] Yikes!

6
00:00:20,104 --> 00:00:22,541
That alien could have told us something
about Sara's whereabouts.

7
00:00:22,565 --> 00:00:24,150
No, girl, that alien is dead.

8
00:00:24,234 --> 00:00:25,610
We don't know that.

9
00:00:25,693 --> 00:00:27,296
We actually don't know
anything about these creatures.

10
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,739
Hey, some species could survive
head-on collisions.

11
00:00:29,822 --> 00:00:30,865
With a spaceship?

12
00:00:30,949 --> 00:00:32,909
- Going thousands of miles an hour?
- Stop.

13
00:00:33,034 --> 00:00:35,036
Spooner, are you getting any readings?

14
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:37,247
- It's dead.
- [sighs]

15
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:39,350
But the face-sucking squid beasts
in those other pods

16
00:00:39,374 --> 00:00:41,084
just got dumped into the river of time.

17
00:00:41,167 --> 00:00:43,878
- Fantastic.
- Sounds like more unpaid labor to me.

18
00:00:45,171 --> 00:00:48,132
Okay, so every single one of those
aliens was on the ship with Sara,

19
00:00:48,216 --> 00:00:49,944
which means
we just have to find one of them,

20
00:00:49,968 --> 00:00:52,637
and it should lead us back to my girl.

21
00:00:52,762 --> 00:00:54,514
- Right?
- Your fiancée.

22
00:00:55,181 --> 00:00:56,181
Right.

23
00:00:56,474 --> 00:00:58,726
- Gidget, please find us some aliens.
- Please.

24
00:00:58,810 --> 00:00:59,912
[Gideon] <i>Actually, Ms. Tarazi,</i>

25
00:00:59,936 --> 00:01:03,064
<i>it appears we already have a bite,
so to speak.</i>

26
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:04,189
Where?

27
00:01:11,573 --> 00:01:13,575
[theme music playing]

28
00:01:25,253 --> 00:01:26,546
Okay, Gideon. What have we got?

29
00:01:26,629 --> 00:01:30,216
[Gideon] <i>October 10, 1955,
San Bernardino, California.</i>

30
00:01:30,675 --> 00:01:33,094
<i>A town known as
the birthplace of fast food.</i>

31
00:01:33,177 --> 00:01:36,097
And ergo the death
of the great American eatery.

32
00:01:36,723 --> 00:01:38,558
Before fast food,
mom-and-pop burger joints

33
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:40,035
were the beating heart of every town.

34
00:01:40,059 --> 00:01:41,870
[Gideon] <i>Funny you should mention it,
Mr. Tarazi.</i>

35
00:01:41,894 --> 00:01:44,439
<i>The anomaly seems to have started
at Big Bang Burger,</i>

36
00:01:44,564 --> 00:01:46,524
<i>owned by local businessman Bert Beeman.</i>

37
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:52,196
<i>And within 24 hours, San Bernardino went
from bustling suburban enclave to...</i>

38
00:01:53,406 --> 00:01:54,657
- [Zari] Oh.
- [Nate] Whoa.

39
00:01:54,741 --> 00:01:58,202
[Gideon] <i>The entire population was
killed overnight, leaving no survivors.</i>

40
00:01:58,286 --> 00:02:01,289
<i>Historians dubbed it
the "Massacre on Main Street."</i>

41
00:02:01,873 --> 00:02:04,959
No, I would've gone with
"Suburban Slaughter."

42
00:02:05,126 --> 00:02:07,128
Save it for the podcast. [winces]

43
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,128
This is good news.

44
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:09,129
Y'all are dark.

45
00:02:09,172 --> 00:02:11,758
We go back, stop the alien
and it can tell us how to find Sara.

46
00:02:12,884 --> 00:02:16,054
- Okay, so...
- And what exactly is the plan here?

47
00:02:16,137 --> 00:02:17,305
Oh, the...

48
00:02:17,388 --> 00:02:18,848
Well, you're the plan. [chuckles]

49
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:21,643
So you're going to
help us find the alien

50
00:02:21,726 --> 00:02:23,895
and then you're gonna get it
to tell us where Sara is.

51
00:02:23,978 --> 00:02:24,978
No way.

52
00:02:25,021 --> 00:02:27,982
I'm only staying on this ship till
you guys get this thing out of my head.

53
00:02:28,066 --> 00:02:28,982
That was the deal.

54
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:31,277
[Gideon] <i>Apologies, Ms. Cruz,
but that won't be possible.</i>

55
00:02:31,694 --> 00:02:32,779
What?

56
00:02:32,862 --> 00:02:35,865
I was going to tell you before
the whole, you know... alien pods thing.

57
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:37,659
Gideon didn't find anything to remove.

58
00:02:38,284 --> 00:02:39,410
I'm sorry.

59
00:02:39,494 --> 00:02:41,746
So first you kidnapped me,
then you lied.

60
00:02:41,871 --> 00:02:43,247
Take me home, now.

61
00:02:43,373 --> 00:02:46,793
Look, I'm really sorry,
but I can't do that.

62
00:02:46,918 --> 00:02:48,211
I need you to talk to the alien.

63
00:02:48,336 --> 00:02:49,813
This thing's not going
to give us directions

64
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:52,006
to find your girlfriend,
it's gonna kill us.

65
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:54,175
You're amongst
board-certified superheroes.

66
00:02:54,258 --> 00:02:55,778
You don't have to worry
about getting killed.

67
00:02:55,802 --> 00:02:56,803
They took your captain.

68
00:02:56,886 --> 00:02:59,114
If you guys are so super,
then why didn't you just stop them...

69
00:02:59,138 --> 00:03:01,182
Listen to me. I need you
to help us find Sara, okay?

70
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:04,185
After you do that, I will take you
wherever the hell you want to go.

71
00:03:09,482 --> 00:03:11,067
[doo-wop music playing]

72
00:03:11,484 --> 00:03:12,484
[horn honks]

73
00:03:14,529 --> 00:03:16,989
Oh, look at those perfect patties.

74
00:03:17,073 --> 00:03:18,574
Get 'em out while they're hot!

75
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,118
And don't forget...

76
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:21,804
- Service with a smile.
- [waitress whooping]

77
00:03:21,828 --> 00:03:23,263
We've got another one at the window.

78
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:25,123
Let's go! Let's go! Keep it moving.

79
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:27,375
We got a lot of mouths to feed.

80
00:03:33,631 --> 00:03:36,384
[mascot] Welcome to Big Bang Burger.

81
00:03:36,509 --> 00:03:39,303
Try our new cosmic mushroom burger.

82
00:03:39,387 --> 00:03:40,805
What, you think aliens are funny?

83
00:03:42,682 --> 00:03:43,808
It's a paycheck.

84
00:03:45,143 --> 00:03:46,477
The goal is to blend.

85
00:03:47,145 --> 00:03:49,188
You picking up any alien signals?

86
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:51,816
- Mmm-mmm.
- [groans]

87
00:03:53,109 --> 00:03:54,569
Guys. Hey, split up, mingle.

88
00:03:54,652 --> 00:03:57,292
Find out if anyone's seen anything
that could lead us to the alien.

89
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,283
[sighs] And Sara...

90
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:13,671
[Sara groaning]

91
00:04:16,382 --> 00:04:17,382
Sara.

92
00:04:21,387 --> 00:04:22,513
Are you okay?

93
00:04:23,014 --> 00:04:25,933
We just crash-landed
on an alien spaceship.

94
00:04:26,017 --> 00:04:27,602
No, Gary, I'm not okay.

95
00:04:28,394 --> 00:04:31,773
[ship AI speaking alien language]

96
00:04:32,106 --> 00:04:33,900
Oh, boy, that's not good.

97
00:04:34,025 --> 00:04:35,610
What did Alien Gideon say?

98
00:04:35,693 --> 00:04:38,321
Uh... It's a little hard to translate

99
00:04:38,404 --> 00:04:40,698
exactly since in my language,
there over 70 ways

100
00:04:40,782 --> 00:04:43,993
to say, "explode from the inside."

101
00:04:44,702 --> 00:04:48,539
The general idea is
we lost all our fuel when we crashed.

102
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:51,000
Whoa.

103
00:04:51,417 --> 00:04:52,710
Where are we?

104
00:04:52,794 --> 00:04:55,588
We were on course to land on Pliny X19.

105
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:57,590
But Kayla didn't give me
any other details.

106
00:04:57,715 --> 00:04:59,675
Well, I thought she's
supposed to be your fiancée.

107
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,428
Ex-fiancée...

108
00:05:04,055 --> 00:05:06,265
and communication
wasn't our strong suit.

109
00:05:06,349 --> 00:05:11,145
But I do know that we were hired
by some power hungry space lord

110
00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:13,564
to gather the universe's
most dangerous creatures.

111
00:05:14,273 --> 00:05:17,193
And now, we're on his planet.

112
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:21,989
It could be <i>Hunger Games</i> out there
or the air could be poisonous gas...

113
00:05:22,073 --> 00:05:24,367
Okay, we need to find something

114
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,828
that could fuel this ship,
so we can get back home.

115
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:30,331
Or what if we send out a distress signal

116
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:32,500
and then wait
for the Legends to come find us?

117
00:05:32,792 --> 00:05:35,378
- [console beeping]
- And good news...

118
00:05:35,795 --> 00:05:39,632
I've got my deck
of strong American women playing cards.

119
00:05:39,757 --> 00:05:45,263
Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Dolores Huerta,
Representative Shirley Chisholm.

120
00:05:45,388 --> 00:05:47,515
Of all the people to be stuck with...

121
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:50,893
- [dog barking]
- What is that?

122
00:05:54,981 --> 00:05:56,232
[electricity crackling]

123
00:05:56,649 --> 00:05:57,650
Dog?

124
00:05:58,317 --> 00:05:59,819
A really cute dog.

125
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:02,280
Three moons, three moons.
Yeah, I could get behind that.

126
00:06:02,363 --> 00:06:03,698
But a dog? That's weird.

127
00:06:04,365 --> 00:06:07,618
But if the dog can breathe,
that means we can breathe.

128
00:06:07,702 --> 00:06:09,704
[Gary] And it's wearing a scarf.

129
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:13,249
Okay, Gary, resist the cuteness.
You've been fooled by dogs before.

130
00:06:13,374 --> 00:06:14,709
Where you going?

131
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:16,335
I'm gonna follow that dog.

132
00:06:17,753 --> 00:06:18,963
[doo-wop music playing]

133
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,387
Pretty busy here today.
Anything special going on?

134
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:29,807
Oh, it's always busy.
The burgers are out of this world.

135
00:06:32,852 --> 00:06:35,104
- What is that?
- Dragon ash.

136
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:37,398
It's my line
of herbal nootropic supplements

137
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:40,610
designed to enhance brain power,
sex appeal, sleep cycle, spirit...

138
00:06:40,693 --> 00:06:42,737
Sounds like more fries for me.

139
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:44,821
[sniffs]

140
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:47,074
Takes me back to my days
at Burger Herder.

141
00:06:47,617 --> 00:06:50,912
Satisfying ache in my forearm
from a day flipping patties.

142
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:54,582
Of course, those patties
were organic and free-range.

143
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:57,501
The meat they used in 1955
often contained ingredients

144
00:06:57,585 --> 00:06:59,879
which precluded it
from being called "beef."

145
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:03,089
Ew.

146
00:07:08,596 --> 00:07:10,348
You know, I've been thinking, bro...

147
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:13,517
It is time for us to start
sharing the family heirloom.

148
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:14,977
So you can dry your hair faster?

149
00:07:15,061 --> 00:07:19,398
Ha-ha. I helped defeat a god
or whatever that scary blonde lady was.

150
00:07:19,482 --> 00:07:22,693
I'm officially a Legend.
Now all I need is my superpower.

151
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,488
Here. I made a schedule.

152
00:07:25,571 --> 00:07:26,739
- Hey, hey...
- Whoa, whoa.

153
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:29,825
No one is more stoked than me
to discover your powers.

154
00:07:29,951 --> 00:07:31,661
But the totem chose me.

155
00:07:31,744 --> 00:07:34,038
No, you literally stole it.

156
00:07:34,163 --> 00:07:35,164
Uh, debatable.

157
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:36,916
Guys, guys. Shut up.

158
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:38,668
I'm working here.

159
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,751
[police radio chatter]

160
00:07:43,506 --> 00:07:46,133
- I have an idea. Just go with it.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

161
00:07:48,761 --> 00:07:51,138
[in Southern accent]
Pardon me, Officers. Hi.

162
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:55,142
We're just here on vacation,
and we were wondering

163
00:07:55,226 --> 00:07:56,894
how safe is San Bernardino?

164
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:58,312
Safe as houses.

165
00:07:58,396 --> 00:08:01,273
[Agent Sharpe] So no...
arson or robbery?

166
00:08:01,357 --> 00:08:03,526
[in Southern accent] Or any
gruesome eviscerations?

167
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:04,859
[high-pitched frequency whining]

168
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:08,198
[police dispatch] <i>There's a 459A
at Sal's Deli. Repeat, 459A.</i>

169
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:09,407
[Officer] Pass me a napkin?

170
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:13,160
A 459A?

171
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:15,538
- That sounds mighty serious.
- Yes.

172
00:08:17,748 --> 00:08:18,748
Ma'am?

173
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:20,561
If you wanna stick your nose
in someone's business,

174
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:22,128
I suggest you start with your friend.

175
00:08:22,795 --> 00:08:24,922
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I need another burger.

176
00:08:26,465 --> 00:08:28,342
Hey, you all right?

177
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:29,467
Did you hear something?

178
00:08:29,468 --> 00:08:30,468
[Spooner] I can feel it.

179
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:32,013
- It's hungry.
- [Constantine] Focus.

180
00:08:32,638 --> 00:08:33,973
Now where's it coming from, love?

181
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:36,976
Maybe... that way.

182
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,062
The feeling's getting stronger.

183
00:08:40,146 --> 00:08:42,481
What about the waitress?
She has glasses like Gary.

184
00:08:43,232 --> 00:08:45,192
You mean the alien
in a waitress flesh suit?

185
00:08:45,276 --> 00:08:46,569
- Spooner, wait.
- Hey!

186
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:49,030
All right. What are you really?

187
00:08:49,697 --> 00:08:51,323
- [whimpers]
- Her disguise is good.

188
00:08:51,699 --> 00:08:53,159
No, no, wait! Just...

189
00:08:53,743 --> 00:08:56,245
I am so sorry,
my friend thought you were an...

190
00:08:57,413 --> 00:08:58,371
Someone else.

191
00:08:58,372 --> 00:08:59,372
I'm sorry.

192
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:02,209
What happened?
What's wrong with your powers?

193
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:03,461
Nothing.

194
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:05,921
I felt it.
That thing is nearby, believe me.

195
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,549
- I found the alien.
- Rory?

196
00:09:09,717 --> 00:09:11,302
You stole a cop car?

197
00:09:12,178 --> 00:09:13,554
[sighs] Okay, where is it?

198
00:09:13,637 --> 00:09:17,183
That 459A at the deli was followed up
by a 415 at the butcher's

199
00:09:17,308 --> 00:09:19,351
and a 240 at the meat aisle
of the local grocery.

200
00:09:19,435 --> 00:09:21,353
Alarm at the deli,
assault at the groceries

201
00:09:21,437 --> 00:09:22,757
and disturbance at the butcher's.

202
00:09:23,189 --> 00:09:24,398
This thing loves meat.

203
00:09:24,482 --> 00:09:25,983
It must be how the massacres start.

204
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:28,944
Well, let's find it before it gets
the taste for another kind of flesh.

205
00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:32,823
Hey, guys, we have a lead on the alien.
I need you to guard the burger joint.

206
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:36,202
Turns out we have a very hungry alien
with a taste for meat.

207
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,121
Already on it, Captain.

208
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:42,792
Guess who just got summer jobs!

209
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:43,875
Nice.

210
00:09:48,172 --> 00:09:49,172
[cash register dings]

211
00:09:52,134 --> 00:09:53,427
[doo-wop music playing]

212
00:09:55,638 --> 00:09:59,517
So glad you lot applied for the jobs.
Business is booming.

213
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:03,687
I never thought I'd get the chance
to man the grill again professionally.

214
00:10:04,188 --> 00:10:06,023
I'm excited to see the master at work.

215
00:10:06,107 --> 00:10:07,399
[both] Burger buddies!

216
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:09,860
Size nine, right?

217
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:12,988
Seven and a half,
and I am not wearing those.

218
00:10:13,489 --> 00:10:14,489
You're right.

219
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:15,992
We could use...

220
00:10:16,492 --> 00:10:17,952
A handsome man out there.

221
00:10:18,786 --> 00:10:19,702
It's you.

222
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:21,289
- Me? No...
- Yeah.

223
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:23,666
- Okay.
- [Sandy] Let's get you on wheels.

224
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:27,920
Looks like it's time to teach you
the ways of the burger.

225
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:30,297
Let's go meet the meats.

226
00:10:32,133 --> 00:10:33,217
How did I get here?

227
00:10:37,346 --> 00:10:40,224
Don't you have any alien superpowers
that can find a dog?

228
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:42,643
Super smell or echolocation?

229
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:44,520
- I'm not that kind of alien.
- [sighs]

230
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:46,123
I'm not that different from you, really.

231
00:10:46,147 --> 00:10:51,193
- Carbon-based. A few more... tentacles.
- And you eat people.

232
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:53,445
I come from a savage planet.

233
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:56,115
They killed for sport, ate their own.

234
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:58,784
The concept of oral hygiene
was completely unknown.

235
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:02,329
And I wasn't so much engaged to Kayla,

236
00:11:02,413 --> 00:11:05,708
as traded to her, and then I was
sent to Earth to find you.

237
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,586
I never imagined
a place like that could exist.

238
00:11:08,711 --> 00:11:10,963

00:11:13,132 --> 00:11:14,550
[scoffs] Friends?

241
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:17,636
I've known you for three years, and I'm
only now learning you're an alien.

242
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,598
I took some creative license
with the details.

243
00:11:21,265 --> 00:11:23,267
You know, so I could fit in
just like Charlie.

244
00:11:24,393 --> 00:11:25,436
Why me?

245
00:11:25,728 --> 00:11:29,273
Well, I guess whoever's behind all this
has a thing for powerful women, too.

246
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:31,733
Lucky me.

Do we want to know where that came from?

[groans] Yeah, it's here.

253
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:03,098
Here, like before or...

254
00:12:04,934 --> 00:12:07,895
Look, I spent my whole life
trying not to let aliens into my head.

255
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,688
And now to try to save your girlfriend,

256
00:12:09,772 --> 00:12:11,972
I've got them all in there,
which is no freaking picnic.

257
00:12:12,316 --> 00:12:14,693
I don't know how the hell that works,
but I know it does.

258
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:15,903
So back off.

259
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,154
We got something.

260
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:34,797
[Spooner] It's close.

261
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:47,183

[grunting]

263
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:02,283
Is that the Big Bang Burger mascot?

264
00:13:02,408 --> 00:13:05,369
[sighs] That's just a bloke
in an alien's costume.

265
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:09,248
Alien disguised as a human
disguised as an alien.

266
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:10,791
Wow, these things are good.

267
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:13,394
Kid, he's not an alien.
Would you stop pointing your gun at him?

268
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,461
Look?

269
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:18,214
You sure?

270
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:20,509
Because I never saw a man
so mad for meat.

271
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:23,304
And I grew up
along our nation's storied Buffet Belt.

272
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:27,474
All right, let's get him back to the
MedBay and see what we can find out.

273
00:13:28,309 --> 00:13:29,476
- Hey!
- This...

274
00:13:29,685 --> 00:13:31,770
stays with me
until after we talk to the alien.

275
00:13:43,574 --> 00:13:44,783
Careful, careful.

276
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:48,412
On my planet, there are plants
that can literally liquefy you.

277
00:13:48,954 --> 00:13:51,832
Also, ones that can sing. Which I guess
is besides the point, but...

278
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,626
Gary, what did I say about talking?

279
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:58,922
Well, I believe
your precise word was "don't," but...

280
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,467
I sensed nuance in your tone.

281
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,718
[dog barks]

282
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:04,969
[Sara] Huh.

283
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:08,515
I guess I'm not the only
intelligent life form on this planet.

284
00:14:09,141 --> 00:14:12,102
Wait, wait.
We don't know what's in there.

285
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:14,021
It could be a priblintz,

286
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:17,358
which is kind of like a half-jaguar,
half-snake thing or an apteroc,

287
00:14:17,483 --> 00:14:19,276
which is also half-jaguar,
half-snake, but...

288
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,779
Gary! It's not like I haven't
faced aliens before.

289
00:14:24,615 --> 00:14:25,531
Oh.

290
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:26,950
Who the blazes are you?

291
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:29,286
Right back at you.

292
00:14:29,787 --> 00:14:30,745
Wait.

293
00:14:30,746 --> 00:14:32,456
Are you... human?

294
00:14:32,581 --> 00:14:33,999
Not just any human.

295
00:14:35,376 --> 00:14:36,877
It's the queen of diamonds.

296
00:14:38,045 --> 00:14:39,463
Amelia Earhart.

297
00:14:40,381 --> 00:14:41,382
Big fan.

298
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:51,392
Take in that smoke and hold it.

299
00:14:51,517 --> 00:14:55,229
Relaxing those muscles,
releasing any tension...

300
00:14:55,312 --> 00:14:56,980
Can you please stop talking to yourself?

301
00:14:57,064 --> 00:15:00,567
I'm not talking to myself.
I'm talking to my burger.

302
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:07,282
Releasing any tension
and turning it into flavor.

303
00:15:07,366 --> 00:15:08,366
Oh!

304
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:10,661
All right,
no sign of trouble out there.

305
00:15:10,786 --> 00:15:13,455
However, I think my shorts
may be a little too short.

306
00:15:13,539 --> 00:15:16,667
None of my customers are leaving.
Any heat in the kitchen?

307
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:19,128
Well, if we're looking
for people obsessed with meat,

308
00:15:19,253 --> 00:15:20,462
we should probably lock up

309
00:15:20,546 --> 00:15:22,066
- the burger whisperer here.
- [sniffs]

310
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:23,840
[order bell dings]

311
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:26,427
With this spatula
comes a duty to transfer

312
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:30,305
our positive energy into this burger
and out to that town.

313
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:33,559
If these are the vibes you put into
your food, they're going to taste it.

314
00:15:33,851 --> 00:15:36,645
And if these are the vibes
you bring to the mission,

315
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:38,147
the totem's gonna feel it.

316
00:15:39,148 --> 00:15:41,275
Oh, I get it.

317
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,862
You're just looking for another excuse
to keep the totem to yourself.

318
00:15:44,987 --> 00:15:47,614
I don't think it cares
about my meaningless burger job.

319
00:15:47,698 --> 00:15:48,949
Meaningless?

320
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:54,037
The Burger Herder was where I started
to find real meaning in life.

321
00:15:54,163 --> 00:15:56,165
The first place
where people cared about me.

322
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,417
Not 'cause I was
"Dragon Girl's brother,"

323
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,835
but because I was Behrad.

324
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:02,045
Okay, got it.

325
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:05,090
So, you're going to just keep
hogging the totem as payback

326
00:16:05,174 --> 00:16:07,676
because you were jealous of me.
Super mature.

327
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,928
I wasn't jealous.
Are you even listening?

328
00:16:10,012 --> 00:16:12,890
Just felt good
to have something of myself, okay?

329
00:16:13,015 --> 00:16:14,933
Fine. Keep the totem.

330
00:16:15,476 --> 00:16:17,561
You know what, keep the spatula, too.

331
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:20,397
I wouldn't want to ruin
anything else with my negative energy.

332
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:21,773
That's not what I...

333
00:16:22,441 --> 00:16:25,152
It's me. Need that table six order.
Come on.

334
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,194
[Behrad humming]

335
00:16:26,195 --> 00:16:28,363
[Behrad] One dry,
naked single coming right up.

336
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:30,282
- Whip!
- Go, go.

337
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:33,869
Wait. Nate, don't serve that.

338
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:36,079
They'll taste my bad vibes.

339
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:43,337
[Gideon] <i>The scan confirms
the subject's biology is 100% human.</i>

340
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:45,422
[sighs] Look, his biology
might be human,

341
00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:47,799
but I'm still feeling
strong alien vibes.

342
00:16:47,883 --> 00:16:49,360
Well, if there is something in there,

343
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:51,261
the Divination of Hor
should do the trick.

344
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:53,096
It extracts all unwanted influences,

345
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,824
giving you facetime
with whatever's in him.

346
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:56,183
[Spooner] So you just...

347
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:58,310
rattle off this hooey
and magic stuff happens?

348
00:16:58,393 --> 00:16:59,770
Yeah, that's right.

349
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:01,438
[reading chant in other language]

350
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:03,273
Don't finish that sentence.

351
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:05,692
Not unless you want
to summon a trickster prawn.

352
00:17:05,776 --> 00:17:07,778
Yeah, I'd like to see a prawn
get one past me.

353
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:09,821
Let's get this over with.

354
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:11,355
[Constantine sighs] All right.

355
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:16,954
[chanting]

356
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:19,121
[groans]

357
00:17:23,627 --> 00:17:24,670
[all] Oh!

358
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:28,465
- That's some high-grade hooey.
- Wait a second.

359
00:17:29,258 --> 00:17:33,512
I think I've seen this stuff before.
Is that Big Bang Burger's secret sauce?

360
00:17:33,595 --> 00:17:34,763
Don't touch that.

361
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:37,266
- And definitely don't eat it.
- Why would I eat it?

362
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:39,560
That's the alien.

363
00:17:39,643 --> 00:17:40,727
That's the alien?

364
00:17:40,811 --> 00:17:43,480
You mean they're charging
25 cents extra to eat an alien?

365
00:17:43,564 --> 00:17:44,940
That's kind of a bargain, really.

366
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:47,359
That's why I was
hearing it all over town.

367
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:48,860
Because everyone's got it in them.

368
00:17:48,944 --> 00:17:50,737
Like an extra-terrestrial parasite.

369
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:52,948
Driving this town to eat itself alive.

370
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:56,952
Okay, so if that parasitic condiment
is the alien, fine,

371
00:17:57,035 --> 00:17:59,288
then that means you can talk to it.

372
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:00,664
That's not how it works.

373
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:01,664
Will you just try?

374
00:18:01,665 --> 00:18:05,461
Sara's one day closer to dead,
and your plan is to hunt mayo?

375
00:18:05,544 --> 00:18:07,838
Thank you so much
for the constructive feedback, Mick.

376
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:08,921
It's very helpful.

377
00:18:09,965 --> 00:18:12,134
<i>Let me tell you honey
Why I love you so</i>

378
00:18:12,551 --> 00:18:14,886
<i>Kiss me, baby, ooh!</i>

379
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:17,347
<i>Kiss me baby
Set my soul on fire</i>

380
00:18:17,598 --> 00:18:19,308
<i>Kiss me, baby, ooh!</i>

381
00:18:19,391 --> 00:18:23,145
You're doing it! You're in the zone!
The people are loving your burgers, man!

382
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:24,271
I feel like I'm flying.

383
00:18:24,396 --> 00:18:27,399
- Fly, B, fly!
- Spirit ash, do your work.

384
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,154
[Agent Sharpe] <i>Guys, listen to me.</i>

385
00:18:32,613 --> 00:18:33,947
Can I take your order?

386
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:36,283
I need you to stop
serving those burgers,

387
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:38,469
bottle up all that secret sauce
and bring it back to the ship.

388
00:18:38,493 --> 00:18:40,287
The sauce is the alien.

389
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,705
It's like a parasite.

390
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,874
<i>It infects people
and makes them crave more meat.</i>

391
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:46,335
And here I thought my short shorts
were selling burgers.

392
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:49,630
It's like that old movie, <i>The Stuff,</i>
except with aioli instead of ice cream.

393
00:18:49,713 --> 00:18:51,798
Sorry, are you saying
that anyone who ate a burger

394
00:18:51,882 --> 00:18:53,925
is gonna go super crazy now?

395
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:04,645
Copy that, Ava. We'll 86
the hockey pucks on the fly.

396
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:08,482
I think he means we're gonna
stop serving people alien goo.

397
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:10,316
Ew.

398
00:19:13,654 --> 00:19:16,156
All right. Health code violation.
Come on, boys. You gotta go.

399
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:19,993
We don't have the permit
to serve food on roller skates.

400
00:19:20,118 --> 00:19:21,870
Get! Get outta here!

401
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:23,953
So, you get the totem.
I get to take out the trash.

402
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:27,292
What is going on out here?
Where are my customers?

403
00:19:27,793 --> 00:19:30,921
Why, you little...
You're stealing my secret sauce!

404
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:32,756
Bert, it's not what it looks like.

405
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:36,134
Who're you spying for?
It's those two brothers. The Mc...

406
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:40,472
Whatevers. I knew a chef as good as you
was too good to be true.

407
00:19:40,555 --> 00:19:42,224
- Wow.
- It's an honor to hear that, boss.

408
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:45,268
But seriously, this sauce
is making people crazy.

409
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,896
Once they eat it,
they can't stop craving meat.

410
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:49,940
Son, that's called quality.

411
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:53,276
If you keep feeding people this,
they're going to die, Bert.

412
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,946
Well, people don't eat burgers
and fries to live longer.

413
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:57,155
[door opens]

414
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,907
Uh, you might want to...

415
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:03,328
- Ugh.
- [grunting]

416
00:20:03,704 --> 00:20:04,662
More!

417
00:20:04,663 --> 00:20:05,663
- [grunting]
- [screams]

418
00:20:13,088 --> 00:20:14,589
You believe us now, Bert?

419
00:20:14,673 --> 00:20:15,673
This is the last of it?

420
00:20:15,757 --> 00:20:17,026
Where do you even get this stuff?

421
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,136
- Answer him.
- Listen, I don't know.

422
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:21,179
My wife makes it.
It's her secret recipe.

423
00:20:21,263 --> 00:20:22,263
She won't even tell me.

424
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:23,974
- [sighs]
- [Nate groans]

425
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:25,142
Ava, we got a problem.

426
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:26,852
We got all the sauce out of here,

427
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:28,854
but turns out,
there's a lot more of this stuff.

428
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:32,524
Bert says his wife
makes the sauce at their house.

429
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:34,151
Okay, well, if we find it all,

430
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:35,795
then Spooner should be able
to talk to it.

431
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:36,819
I'll head there now.

432
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:41,992
I still don't understand.
How did you end up here?

433
00:20:42,117 --> 00:20:44,237
Well, Earhart's' interest in flying
began with a visit

434
00:20:44,286 --> 00:20:45,746
to the Canadian National Exhibition.

435
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:48,999
Sorry. It's a fun fact.

436
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:52,002
I wish I had an answer for you.

437
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:54,880
Last thing I remember,
I was soaring over the Pacific.

438
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:58,341
Me and my navigator, Fred, almost done
our flight around the globe.

439
00:20:58,675 --> 00:21:00,218
It was mission accomplished.

440
00:21:00,552 --> 00:21:04,139
Then the left engine started sputtering,
the Canary bucked,

441
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:06,725
and I hit my head hard and blacked out.

442
00:21:06,808 --> 00:21:09,269
When I woke up, Fred was gone,
and I was here.

443
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:12,481
And where is "here"?

444
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:14,983
I thought it was heaven or something,

445
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:20,030
but to tell you the truth,
I still don't know where we are exactly.

446
00:21:20,447 --> 00:21:21,907
On the bright side, the food's good.

447
00:21:22,616 --> 00:21:26,077
Hey, listen, I'm trying
to repair my aircraft.

448
00:21:26,244 --> 00:21:27,954
Maybe you can take a look at it.

449
00:21:28,747 --> 00:21:30,957
- It needs a fuel source...
- An aircraft?

450
00:21:32,334 --> 00:21:34,836
But that means
that you can take me home.

451
00:21:35,629 --> 00:21:37,672
Oh... Well, yeah.

452
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:39,090
I mean, I guess why not?

453
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:41,176
Let's do it. Let's go.

454
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:42,344
First, let me serve you.

455
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:46,556
Why let this meal go to waste?

456
00:21:47,641 --> 00:21:49,684
It's been so long
since I've had any guests.

457
00:21:52,229 --> 00:21:53,229
Uh...

458
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:54,356
Yeah, sure. Okay.

459
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:55,482
Hot dog!

460
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,820
I've been frightfully lonesome
since I've been here.

461
00:21:59,903 --> 00:22:01,112
Yeah.

462
00:22:01,196 --> 00:22:02,781
You two are lucky to have each other.

463
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,032
[mutters]

464
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:13,583
[high-pitched frequency whining]

465
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:15,502
Oh, yeah.

466
00:22:15,585 --> 00:22:16,586
This is the spot.

467
00:22:16,711 --> 00:22:18,171
Let's go interrogate this thing.

468
00:22:18,547 --> 00:22:21,424
I keep trying to tell you
that's not how it works.

469
00:22:21,842 --> 00:22:22,968
I don't speak alien.

470
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:25,470
It's more like I can sense them,
know what they're feeling.

471
00:22:25,554 --> 00:22:27,990
Know what they're feeling?
How is that supposed to get Sara back?

472
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:29,766
You're the one
that brought me here, <i>jefa.</i>

473
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:32,727
Why do you people listen to her?
She's gonna get you all killed.

474
00:22:32,811 --> 00:22:33,811
Don't, mate...

475
00:22:33,812 --> 00:22:34,998
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

476
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:38,525
It means you don't cross an alien
without losing something.

477
00:22:38,608 --> 00:22:40,728
It means the longer you pretend
she's still out there,

478
00:22:41,069 --> 00:22:42,755
that these things
will help you get her back,

479
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:43,864
the more you're gonna lose.

480
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:45,323
- Stop.
- She's gone.

481
00:22:45,407 --> 00:22:48,243
And if you can get that in your head,
at least you can save yourself.

482
00:22:50,161 --> 00:22:52,414
Shut up, Spooner.

483
00:22:52,998 --> 00:22:54,082
Watch her, John.

484
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:55,166
Yeah.

485
00:22:57,085 --> 00:22:59,880
- So you're with the police?
- Mmm-hmm.

486
00:22:59,963 --> 00:23:01,923
Which officer are you married to?

487
00:23:02,257 --> 00:23:03,758
Hmm? Oh...

488
00:23:04,676 --> 00:23:08,889
Well, you probably haven't met him yet,
seeing as we just moved here and all.

489
00:23:09,681 --> 00:23:12,684
But that's why I wanted
to introduce myself to you.

490
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:15,020
My, my, my.

491
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:17,397
What a lovely home you have here.

492
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:20,025
[gasping]

493
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:23,111
Is that an electric mixer?

494
00:23:23,194 --> 00:23:24,279
[Rhonda] It sure is.

495
00:23:24,362 --> 00:23:26,823
I have heard about these.

496
00:23:26,948 --> 00:23:28,366
Wow.

497
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,327
It's like I'm in the future.

498
00:23:30,493 --> 00:23:32,037
It does everything...

499
00:23:32,537 --> 00:23:33,914
Cakes, cookies.

500
00:23:34,497 --> 00:23:37,292
You know, I just whipped up a batch.

501
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:38,919
You have to try them.

502
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:40,879
Oh... Oh!

503
00:23:40,962 --> 00:23:43,548
No, I couldn't, I am stuffed.

504
00:23:44,007 --> 00:23:45,550
I just had lunch at Big Bang Burger.

505
00:23:46,051 --> 00:23:47,928
Talk about a welcome
to the neighborhood.

506
00:23:48,011 --> 00:23:51,598
Well, isn't that something,
that's my husband's restaurant.

507
00:23:52,474 --> 00:23:54,601
You don't say. [laughs]

508
00:23:54,684 --> 00:23:57,479
You know what makes
those burgers really special?

509
00:23:58,229 --> 00:23:59,522
It's that secret sauce.

510
00:23:59,898 --> 00:24:01,107
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

511
00:24:01,483 --> 00:24:04,486
And he was bragging to everyone
about how it's his wife's recipe.

512
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:06,613
It's true.

513
00:24:06,696 --> 00:24:09,115
My little contribution
to the family business.

514
00:24:09,866 --> 00:24:11,618
You have to tell me
how you came up with it.

515
00:24:13,244 --> 00:24:14,579
What's your secret ingredient?

516
00:24:15,997 --> 00:24:17,207
But I couldn't.

517
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:18,750
Oh, come on.

518
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:20,752
Just between us girls.

519
00:24:23,004 --> 00:24:24,005
All right,

520
00:24:24,756 --> 00:24:27,801
but what I'm about to say
cannot leave these walls.

521
00:24:27,926 --> 00:24:30,011
To be honest, it's a little weird,

522
00:24:30,095 --> 00:24:32,472
and I'm not too sure people
are ready for the truth.

523
00:24:32,889 --> 00:24:35,266
I am all ears, no lips.

524
00:24:36,935 --> 00:24:38,395
My secret ingredient?

525
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,605
It's rice vinegar.

526
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:42,524
From the East.

527
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:46,569
[gasps] Wow!

528
00:24:46,653 --> 00:24:49,322
- I know, exotic.
- Yes.

529
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,826
Well, I really should be
getting dinner started.

530
00:24:52,951 --> 00:24:54,744
These eggs aren't gonna
devil themselves.

531
00:24:54,828 --> 00:24:55,870
No, no.

532
00:24:57,288 --> 00:24:58,288
[liquid drips]

533
00:25:11,219 --> 00:25:12,219
Um...

534
00:25:12,387 --> 00:25:13,680
I'll just see myself out.

535
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,223
Toodle-loo.

536
00:25:20,603 --> 00:25:23,606
This better be the last of the alien
sauce or we will call the FDA.

537
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:25,775
All right. I've got Sandra set up
in the back office

538
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:27,819
with enough burgers to last her
through the night.

539
00:25:28,403 --> 00:25:29,612
Meat!

540
00:25:29,904 --> 00:25:31,281
[Officer] Meat!

541
00:25:31,364 --> 00:25:33,867
Oh, no. Not the nice couple
from table six!

542
00:25:34,951 --> 00:25:35,994
[Behrad] Get back!

543
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:41,374
Look alive, team.

544
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:43,626
The dinner rush is here.

545
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:48,089
What does that look like to you?

546
00:25:48,631 --> 00:25:51,051
I don't know,
Mr. Beeman's midlife crisis?

547
00:25:51,176 --> 00:25:52,469
[Spooner] No, not the car.

548
00:25:52,927 --> 00:25:54,637
That weird bumpy box.

549
00:26:08,693 --> 00:26:09,694
Anybody up here?

550
00:26:20,538 --> 00:26:22,415
[clicks]

551
00:26:34,469 --> 00:26:35,470
The alien's pod.

552
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:44,437
[high-pitched frequency whining]

553
00:26:46,314 --> 00:26:47,857
Wait...

554
00:26:48,858 --> 00:26:49,859
I can read that.

555
00:26:50,527 --> 00:26:52,195
Well, what does it say, squire?

556
00:26:52,987 --> 00:26:54,364
"Giant air feeder."

557
00:26:54,489 --> 00:26:55,949
And what the hell is that?

558
00:26:56,032 --> 00:26:58,368
I don't know, but it sure
don't look like a sauce monster.

559
00:26:58,451 --> 00:26:59,953
Yeah.

560
00:27:00,036 --> 00:27:01,371
Good work.

561
00:27:01,454 --> 00:27:02,370
Ava?

562
00:27:02,372 --> 00:27:04,052
[Agent Sharpe] <i>Just give me
a second, John.</i>

563
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:06,626
Damn it!

564
00:27:06,709 --> 00:27:07,709
[sighs]

565
00:27:15,176 --> 00:27:16,176
[gasps]

566
00:27:20,765 --> 00:27:22,058
Oh, my God.

567
00:27:24,644 --> 00:27:25,728
- [grunts]
- [thuds]

568
00:27:27,981 --> 00:27:29,524
I told you it does everything.

569
00:27:31,401 --> 00:27:32,401
[sighs]

570
00:27:34,237 --> 00:27:36,072
I won't let her take you from me.

571
00:27:37,991 --> 00:27:39,576
I won't let her.

572
00:27:48,877 --> 00:27:49,877
[groans]

573
00:27:52,589 --> 00:27:54,549
[Rhonda] I knew you were
up to something.

574
00:27:55,842 --> 00:27:57,760
Is your husband even a policeman?

575
00:27:59,012 --> 00:28:02,265
Well, you see, my wife.

576
00:28:02,807 --> 00:28:04,350
Well, she's my fiancée.

577
00:28:05,268 --> 00:28:07,687
Technically, she hasn't asked me yet,
but I did say yes,

578
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:09,147
so I guess that makes us...

579
00:28:10,732 --> 00:28:11,733
Never mind.

580
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:15,195
Sara, my friend.

581
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:18,156
She was abducted by aliens.

582
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:20,325
And that's exactly what that thing is.

583
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,910
It's an alien.

584
00:28:24,078 --> 00:28:27,498
I have no idea which part of that
sentence makes the least sense.

585
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:29,751
I don't care what she is.

586
00:28:30,501 --> 00:28:31,502
She's mine.

587
00:28:33,046 --> 00:28:34,672
My little miracle.

588
00:28:35,924 --> 00:28:38,301
She's the only thing
keeping our business alive.

589
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:39,926
Wait a minute.

590
00:28:39,928 --> 00:28:43,306
You've been knowingly
serving your customers that slime?

591
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:45,725
At first I didn't know
where the stuff came from.

592
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:49,771
<i>Last Wednesday,
I served Bert his favorite,</i>

593
00:28:49,854 --> 00:28:50,939
<i>Salisbury steak,</i>

594
00:28:51,731 --> 00:28:54,275
<i>when something from the ceiling
dripped onto his plate.</i>

595
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:58,029
<i>I tried to stop him,</i>

596
00:28:58,112 --> 00:29:00,657
<i>but he tasted it and loved it.</i>

597
00:29:01,282 --> 00:29:03,034
<i>He thought it was my recipe.</i>

598
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:07,789
<i>Bert's business had been failing,
and it was taking our marriage with it.</i>

599
00:29:08,248 --> 00:29:10,875
<i>He was sure if we added
my secret sauce to the menu,</i>

600
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:12,377
<i>we could turn things around.</i>

601
00:29:13,169 --> 00:29:15,421
<i>So I had to find out
where this sauce came from.</i>

602
00:29:16,047 --> 00:29:17,507
<i>While Bert was asleep,</i>

603
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:20,718
<i>I came up here and discovered it.</i>

604
00:29:21,302 --> 00:29:24,097
<i>This beautiful creature.</i>

605
00:29:24,889 --> 00:29:27,100
<i>She'd found her way into our attic.</i>

606
00:29:27,642 --> 00:29:29,143
<i>She was small back then.</i>

607
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:33,523
<i>And I knew the universe gave her to me</i>

608
00:29:34,148 --> 00:29:38,236
to save our marriage [laughs]
and our family business.

609
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,365
Rhonda, I need you
to let me take it from here.

610
00:29:42,448 --> 00:29:45,451
We're running out of time.
Look at it. It's growing.

611
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:47,620
It could take over the whole town.

612
00:29:48,913 --> 00:29:51,082
Wait, you're right.

613
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,168
If she's growing, that means...

614
00:29:56,129 --> 00:29:58,131
we could franchise. [gasps]

615
00:29:58,464 --> 00:30:01,342
Finally, the Beemans will get
the success they deserve.

616
00:30:01,426 --> 00:30:03,136
We'll take over more than this town.

617
00:30:03,678 --> 00:30:05,555
We'll put those brothers
out of business.

618
00:30:05,638 --> 00:30:08,641
Big Bang Burger will be
a household name.

619
00:30:08,766 --> 00:30:11,102
We'll be in every city, every state...

620
00:30:11,769 --> 00:30:13,021
Oh! [groans]

621
00:30:13,104 --> 00:30:15,481
Hate to see a small business
go down like that.

622
00:30:16,232 --> 00:30:17,692
Spooner!

623
00:30:17,775 --> 00:30:20,028
I am so glad
that you don't follow orders.

624
00:30:21,029 --> 00:30:23,239
Well, looks like doomsday's
finally here,

625
00:30:23,823 --> 00:30:25,074
and it's ordered the burger.

626
00:30:28,786 --> 00:30:30,288
We need to calm these people down.

627
00:30:30,371 --> 00:30:32,123
Wait, I have an idea.

628
00:30:32,206 --> 00:30:33,583
Sleepytime dragon ash.

629
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:35,793
Even a small dose will calm
the most restless spirit.

630
00:30:36,169 --> 00:30:37,729
Yeah, but how do we get them to eat it?

631
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:40,649
By giving the customer what they want.

632
00:30:40,673 --> 00:30:43,551
I'll lace the burgers with dragon ash,
feed 'em to the horde.

633
00:30:43,634 --> 00:30:44,635
Yes!

634
00:30:44,719 --> 00:30:46,012
But I'll have to serve quick.

635
00:30:50,683 --> 00:30:51,976
Behrad, wait. Let me help.

636
00:30:52,268 --> 00:30:53,394
Zari, are you sure?

637
00:30:53,478 --> 00:30:54,718
[Zari] I learned from the best.

638
00:30:55,313 --> 00:30:57,106
Today, you're not Dragon Girl's brother.

639
00:30:58,941 --> 00:31:00,360
I'm Burger Boy's sister.

640
00:31:01,736 --> 00:31:03,154
[all clamoring]

641
00:31:04,197 --> 00:31:05,198
You're gonna need this.

642
00:31:14,624 --> 00:31:17,043
So you're saying
this lady found a cocoon

643
00:31:17,126 --> 00:31:19,837
oozing alien pus and thought,
"Let's put this on the menu"?

644
00:31:19,921 --> 00:31:23,049
Yeah, you might not wanna look
at what's in fast food these days.

645
00:31:23,841 --> 00:31:25,635
So if that's the alien,

646
00:31:25,718 --> 00:31:28,805
then why is the sauce
driving everyone into a feeding frenzy?

647
00:31:28,888 --> 00:31:30,608
When this thing pops,
she's gonna be hungry.

648
00:31:31,265 --> 00:31:33,351
She's been fattening up the town
for her first meal.

649
00:31:34,394 --> 00:31:35,603
The massacre.

650
00:31:36,437 --> 00:31:37,437
[gasps]

651
00:31:38,648 --> 00:31:43,361
I won't let you take this from me!

652
00:31:43,486 --> 00:31:46,280
She's mine, all mine!

653
00:31:46,364 --> 00:31:50,535
I won't let you destroy
our American dream!

654

[roars]

657
00:32:06,551 --> 00:32:07,593
We need to contain it.

658
00:32:16,727 --> 00:32:18,312
I bet I know where it's going.

659
00:32:19,105 --> 00:32:20,815
Four patties coming in hot!

660
00:32:26,946 --> 00:32:28,156
Give 'em the works.

661
00:32:28,239 --> 00:32:32,160
That would be four cows
buried in snow, RIP.

662
00:32:32,743 --> 00:32:33,744
Pick up.

663
00:32:50,136 --> 00:32:51,137
It worked.

664
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,805
They're falling asleep.

665
00:32:53,306 --> 00:32:56,225
[all three] Burger buddies!

666
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,829
- [Agent Sharpe] <i>Hey, guys.</i>
- [Spooner] <i>Hey, we found the alien.</i>

667
00:32:58,853 --> 00:32:59,853
Tell 'em we found the alien.

668
00:32:59,854 --> 00:33:01,606
Yeah, it turns out the goo
isn't the alien.

669
00:33:01,689 --> 00:33:03,357
It's a huge flying bug.

670
00:33:03,441 --> 00:33:05,610
Like Mothra. Cool.

671
00:33:05,693 --> 00:33:06,837
[Agent Sharpe] <i>It has a taste
for human flesh,</i>

672
00:33:06,861 --> 00:33:08,488
<i>and it is headed your way.</i>

673
00:33:09,363 --> 00:33:10,698
Well, that's less cool.

[shrieking]

675
00:33:24,128 --> 00:33:25,129
Guys...

676
00:33:27,423 --> 00:33:28,883
[shrieks]

677
00:33:29,383 --> 00:33:31,719
I liked the alien better
when it was goo.

678
00:33:31,844 --> 00:33:32,929
Damn it!

679
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:34,679
[brakes screech]

680
00:33:39,644 --> 00:33:41,145
How are we supposed to get it down?

681
00:33:41,229 --> 00:33:42,230
We need bait.

682
00:33:42,355 --> 00:33:43,731
Oh, jeez.

683
00:33:43,814 --> 00:33:45,650
Oh, shoo!

684
00:33:45,733 --> 00:33:47,068
Shoo, you!

685
00:33:47,193 --> 00:33:50,154
- Just what I need.
- Hey, get inside, you silly git!

686
00:33:51,656 --> 00:33:53,699
Whoa!

687
00:33:53,783 --> 00:33:55,868
[screaming]

688
00:34:00,957 --> 00:34:03,793
You wanna take it back to the ship,
see if maybe I can talk to it?

689
00:34:04,001 --> 00:34:06,128
Uh... Yeah. Light it up.

690
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,510
[shrieking]

691
00:34:22,395 --> 00:34:23,395
Whew!

692
00:34:29,193 --> 00:34:31,612
I'm not gonna lie,
that was very satisfying.

693
00:34:43,124 --> 00:34:44,166
Double-fisting?

694
00:34:45,001 --> 00:34:46,085
I like your style.

695
00:34:46,168 --> 00:34:48,754
Oh, I poured it for Sara.

696
00:34:48,838 --> 00:34:50,298
It's just habit.

697
00:34:50,715 --> 00:34:51,715
Hmm.

698
00:34:52,758 --> 00:34:54,552
Hey, shouldn't let it go to waste.

699
00:34:58,723 --> 00:34:59,723
[Spooner clears throat]

700
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:03,394
I'm sorry I couldn't help you
find your lady.

701
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:04,937
Mmm. No.

702
00:35:05,021 --> 00:35:07,231
Ava Sharpe does not give up that easily.

703
00:35:11,861 --> 00:35:13,279
Listen, I owe you an apology.

704
00:35:14,196 --> 00:35:18,784
I was so desperate for this alien
to be the answer to all my prayers

705
00:35:19,577 --> 00:35:21,930
that I didn't even think about
how you'd be feeling about any of it.

706
00:35:21,954 --> 00:35:22,997
No, I get it.

707
00:35:24,123 --> 00:35:25,207
Sara's a lucky woman.

708
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:26,792
Thanks.

709
00:35:27,918 --> 00:35:29,086
You know,

710
00:35:29,879 --> 00:35:32,340
I know what it's like
to have people mess with you,

711
00:35:33,174 --> 00:35:34,383
and it doesn't make you crazy.

712
00:35:35,635 --> 00:35:37,553
Just makes you vigilant.

713
00:35:41,724 --> 00:35:44,393
So what happened to you
when you were a kid?

714
00:35:47,063 --> 00:35:49,482
Look, I don't really talk about...

715
00:35:55,946 --> 00:35:57,114
My mom.

716
00:35:59,241 --> 00:36:00,284
I don't know...

717
00:36:01,035 --> 00:36:03,496
I don't know where they took us
or what they did to us.

718
00:36:03,579 --> 00:36:06,957
But, you know, when I woke up,

719
00:36:07,041 --> 00:36:09,168
she was gone.

720
00:36:11,045 --> 00:36:13,285
- Maybe she's still...
- I had to stop thinking that way.

721
00:36:13,964 --> 00:36:15,549
No hoping like that for that long.

722
00:36:15,633 --> 00:36:17,468
That can drive you crazy.

723
00:36:18,761 --> 00:36:22,223
And instead, I gave up everything,

724
00:36:22,306 --> 00:36:25,351
preparing for the moment I'd get to blow
one of those things away.

725
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:28,145
You know, but now that I've done it,

726
00:36:29,563 --> 00:36:32,274
I thought I'd feel something more.

727
00:36:34,694 --> 00:36:36,445
Instead, I just got nothing left.

728
00:36:38,447 --> 00:36:39,740
I mean, you've got us.

729
00:36:41,992 --> 00:36:43,077
- You mean...
- If...

730
00:36:44,328 --> 00:36:46,580
- If you'll stay.
- You want me to stay?

731
00:36:47,581 --> 00:36:49,625
I almost killed a furry in the freezer.

732
00:36:50,084 --> 00:36:52,420
We need to adjust
some of your tactics a little, but...

733
00:36:52,503 --> 00:36:56,006
This thing in my head,
I don't know how to control it.

734
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:57,508
Well, we can help you learn.

735
00:36:58,384 --> 00:37:00,636
This isn't the end
for either of us, so...

736
00:37:03,305 --> 00:37:04,515
Yeah.

737
00:37:05,474 --> 00:37:08,728
You're right. It isn't over.

738
00:37:09,937 --> 00:37:11,731
There are still more aliens out there.

739
00:37:11,814 --> 00:37:12,857
Exactly.

740
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,751
- You can still find your girlfriend.
- [sighs]

741
00:37:14,775 --> 00:37:15,776
I know we will.

742
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:18,112
And that I just didn't shoot
enough of 'em.

743
00:37:18,654 --> 00:37:19,989
Uh...

744
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:21,615
Wait, that's not...

745
00:37:21,699 --> 00:37:23,200
All right.

746
00:37:23,868 --> 00:37:24,869
I'm in.

747
00:37:24,994 --> 00:37:28,664
We're gonna keep killing aliens until
you find Sara and I get some closure.

748
00:37:28,748 --> 00:37:30,583
Yeah, that's not what...

749
00:37:33,544 --> 00:37:35,838
Actually, that sounds
like a perfect plan.

750
00:37:36,505 --> 00:37:37,506
[chuckles] Okay.

751
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:39,924
[Zari sighs]

752
00:37:40,134 --> 00:37:41,218
Well, thanks.

753
00:37:41,343 --> 00:37:44,805
I loved being back behind the grill,
but my pores did not.

754
00:37:44,889 --> 00:37:45,931
Time to cleanse.

755
00:37:46,682 --> 00:37:48,042
<i>In the wake
of what has been called</i>

756
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,352
<i>the deadliest butterfly attack

757
00:37:50,436 --> 00:37:52,521
<i>we have a little bit of good news.</i>

760
00:37:56,859 --> 00:37:59,403
<i>to re-open the beloved diner

761
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,447
Yes, girl boss.

762
00:38:01,572 --> 00:38:03,365
I hope she turned it into a juice place.

763

<i>It's belly, belly good!</i>

764
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:10,331
She did not.

765
00:38:10,873 --> 00:38:12,875
Hey, Z, about before,

766
00:38:13,417 --> 00:38:14,627
you were right.

767
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:17,379
I've been selfish
about this whole totem thing.

768
00:38:17,463 --> 00:38:19,632
And a little patriarchal.

769
00:38:20,466 --> 00:38:22,802
It would be my privilege
to share it with you.

770
00:38:23,093 --> 00:38:24,094
[Zari clears throat]

771
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:28,140
No, I need to respect your boundaries.

772
00:38:28,224 --> 00:38:30,643
The totem is your thing. I get that.

773
00:38:30,726 --> 00:38:32,478
It's a Tarazi family heirloom.

774
00:38:32,561 --> 00:38:34,271
It only makes sense that we both use it.

775
00:38:34,396 --> 00:38:37,775
There is no shortage of ways
for me to be super.

776
00:38:37,858 --> 00:38:42,363
I don't need to take away your power
to harness my own.

777
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,242
Listen, you've given me
a new life, new friends.

[Behrad] <i>It's already yours, Z.</i>

780
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,622
<i>- The totem chose both of us.</i>
- [sighs]

to give it back to you, B.</i>

[Behrad] <i>But think of all the ways</i>

783
00:38:54,875 --> 00:38:56,794
<i>you could use your wind powers
to help the team.</i>

784
00:38:56,877 --> 00:38:59,129
You know, I've been thinking
of talking to Ava.

785
00:38:59,213 --> 00:39:03,175
I could see myself in a more
managerial capacity on the ship.

786
00:39:03,843 --> 00:39:05,219
I can't take this anymore.

787
00:39:05,636 --> 00:39:06,636
[snaps fingers]

788
00:39:10,182 --> 00:39:11,350
[Behrad] Whoa!

789
00:39:12,142 --> 00:39:13,686
It's split in two.

790
00:39:14,311 --> 00:39:17,398
We're, like, really good at sharing.

791
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,403
Fearless flyer, fashion icon
and a great hostess.

792
00:39:22,486 --> 00:39:24,071
I mean, is there anything she can't do?

793
00:39:24,154 --> 00:39:26,365
- Yeah, and the stew was good.
- Yes.

794
00:39:26,448 --> 00:39:27,867
Hope you like your coffee straight.

795
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:28,993
[Gary] Yep.

796
00:39:29,076 --> 00:39:31,704
You've really made a home
for yourself here.

797
00:39:31,787 --> 00:39:33,831
And how did you get through
those first few nights?

798
00:39:37,167 --> 00:39:38,419
Wish I had an answer for you.

799
00:39:39,128 --> 00:39:41,589
The last thing I remember,
I was soaring over the Pacific.

800
00:39:41,922 --> 00:39:43,132
Me and my navigator, Fred,

801
00:39:43,215 --> 00:39:45,110
were almost done with our flight
around the globe.

802
00:39:45,134 --> 00:39:46,385
It was mission accomplished.

803
00:39:47,177 --> 00:39:49,054
What? Are you feeling okay?

804
00:39:49,763 --> 00:39:51,098
Wish I had an answer for you.

805
00:39:52,266 --> 00:39:54,727
Last thing I remember,
I was soaring over the Pacific.

806
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:55,936
Me and my navigator, Fred,

807
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:57,780
almost done with our flight
around the globe.

808
00:39:57,855 --> 00:39:59,064
It was mission accomplished.

809
00:39:59,815 --> 00:40:01,334
Then the left engine
started stuttering...

810
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:03,652
I have a bad feeling about this
and we need to go now.

811
00:40:03,944 --> 00:40:04,945
Come on.

812
00:40:05,029 --> 00:40:06,155
Where you going?

813
00:40:07,323 --> 00:40:10,326
We were just heading back to the ship
because it's getting dark.

814
00:40:10,409 --> 00:40:11,452
No!

815
00:40:11,535 --> 00:40:13,412
You can't leave me here.
I need to go with you.

816
00:40:14,663 --> 00:40:15,706
What?

817
00:40:16,498 --> 00:40:17,875
I need to go home!

818
00:40:19,001 --> 00:40:20,085
[shrieks]

819
00:40:23,923 --> 00:40:24,923
[groans]

820
00:40:25,466 --> 00:40:27,384
Sara, we need to go.

821
00:40:27,718 --> 00:40:29,178
[Sara] God!

822
00:40:29,345 --> 00:40:30,804
- [Sara groaning]
- [Gary grunting]

823
00:40:40,397 --> 00:40:41,397
[groans]

824
00:40:43,442 --> 00:40:45,819
I'm sorry. This is all my fault.

825
00:40:48,238 --> 00:40:50,866
I swear I will do everything
in my power to get you home.

826
00:40:51,367 --> 00:40:53,035
Ideally in time for a spring wedding,

827
00:40:53,118 --> 00:40:54,763
although with your matching
Nordic complexions,

828
00:40:54,787 --> 00:40:56,705
a winter wedding would be spectacular.

829
00:40:57,414 --> 00:40:58,666
Gary.

830
00:40:58,999 --> 00:40:59,999
[grunts]

831
00:41:00,709 --> 00:41:03,045
You're not planning my wedding.

832
00:41:03,837 --> 00:41:04,838
Ouch.

833
00:41:05,506 --> 00:41:06,507
Okay.

834
00:41:09,259 --> 00:41:10,259
[mutters]

835
00:41:11,053 --> 00:41:13,055
A winter wedding would be beautiful.

836
00:41:14,765 --> 00:41:15,766
Yeah.

837
00:41:16,809 --> 00:41:17,851
What is that?

838
00:41:23,816 --> 00:41:27,194
A firefly to guide us to safety.

839
00:41:35,202 --> 00:41:36,203
I hope.

840
00:41:45,295 --> 00:41:47,297
