Whoo!

1010
00:41:32,007 --> 00:41:34,174
Hoo! What did I miss?

1011
00:41:34,176 --> 00:41:36,462
Dad, meet your son, Bart.

1012
00:41:36,465 --> 00:41:38,386
Hey, Dad! What's good?

1013
00:41:38,388 --> 00:41:39,971
Or "Pops." Can I call you Pops yet?

1014
00:41:39,973 --> 00:41:41,347
You like it when I call you Pops later.

1015
00:41:41,349 --> 00:41:42,682
I can't remember when that is, though.

1016
00:41:42,684 --> 00:41:45,474
Yo, this place is crash!

1017
00:41:52,058 --> 00:41:58,645
