SHE HELPED OLIVER
GET OUT OF PRISON
THE LEGAL WAY,

461
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,931
AND SHE STOPPED ME
FROM KILLING
RICARDO DIAZ.

462
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:07,474
FELICITY SMOAK IS
KILLING PEOPLE NOW?

463
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,185
I REALLY HAVE
MISSED A LOT.

464
00:21:09,227 --> 00:21:10,937
THE POINT IS,
IS THAT I DIDN'T
KILL ANYONE

465
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,813
BECAUSE LAUREL PULLED
ME BACK FROM THE EDGE.

466
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:14,648
THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO
DO FOR HER NOW,

467
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,859

OUT A LIFELINE.

468
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:20,362
EVEN IF THERE WAS
A WAY BACK FOR LAUREL,
SHE HAS TO WANT IT.

00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:22,531
YOU CAN'T FORCE
REDEMPTION ON PEOPLE.

470

OH, THAT I KNOW.

471
00:21:25,076 --> 00:21:27,078
WELL, IT'S ALL

SINCE I HAVE NO IDEA

WHERE SHADOW THIEF

OPERATING OUT OF.

IS THAT WHERE LAUREL'S
BEEN HOLING UP?

478

THAT'S WHAT DINAH THINKS.

DOESN'T GO IN BLIND.

SO WE DON'T GO
IN BLIND.

MORE OF A TWO-WOMAN JOB.

SHE IS THE SAME MONSTER
WHO KILLED VINNIE.

532
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:17,415
WHAT LAUREL DID
IS UNFORGIVEABLE,

533
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:19,833
BUT SHE'S JUST
ON THIS PATH,

534

AND SHE DOESN'T KNOW
HOW TO GET OFF OF IT.

TIMES IN MY LIFE

DOWN THE SAME PATH,

DARKEST OF TIMES,

EVEN WHEN YOU
WERE HELL-BENT

WE STILL HAD
YOUR BACK.

A SECOND CHANCE,

ARE NOW.

BUT I DON'T THINK
IT MATTERS WITH LAUREL.

555
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:59,665
I DON'T THINK SHE EVER
EVEN WANTED THAT KIND
OF SUPPORT.

556
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:01,959
OR MAYBE SHE WANTED
IT MORE THAN ANY OF US

AND DIDN'T REALIZE IT
UNTIL IT WAS GONE.

OUT THERE ON YOUR OWN,

MAKE IT BACK ALIVE.

563

YOUR SAFE HOUSES, DINAH.

564
00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:30,528
THEY'LL FIND
THIS ONE, TOO.

565
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:31,989
I'M NOT GONNA SIT
AROUND AND WAIT
FOR THEM

566
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:35,201
TO MASSACRE
THE REST OF US.

567
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:37,619
BELIEVE ME, THERE IS
NOTHING I WOULD
LOVE MORE THAN TO SEE

568
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:39,913
THOSE SONS OF BITCHES
PAY FOR WHAT THEY DID
TO MY GIRLS.

569
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,539
SO WHY DON'T YOU?

570
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:44,377
BECAUSE I KNOW I
CAN'T DO IT ALONE,

571
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:46,337
AND NEITHER CAN YOU.

572
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:48,214
THEN COME WITH ME.

573
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:49,589
INSTEAD OF HIDING
IN THE SHADOWS,

574
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:51,675
LET'S TAKE THIS FIGHT
TO GALAXY ONE,

575
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:55,346
MAKE THEM PAY
FOR BLOOD WITH BLOOD.

576
00:25:55,388 --> 00:25:58,015
SOMETIMES, I DON'T
KNOW WHO YOU SOUND
MORE LIKE...

577
00:25:58,057 --> 00:25:59,850
YOUR MOTHER
OR YOUR FATHER.

578
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:06,899
DO YOU KNOW WHY
I STARTED THE CANARIES,

579
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,735
WHAT IT REPRESENTS?

580
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:13,906
THIS IS MORE THAN JUST
SOME REBELLION GROUP.

581
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:16,325
IT'S A SUPPORT SYSTEM.

582
00:26:16,367 --> 00:26:19,245
THIS IS A WAY FOR WOMEN
TO KNOW WE ALWAYS HAVE
EACH OTHER'S BACKS

583
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:21,330
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,

584
00:26:21,372 --> 00:26:23,623
WHENEVER WE NEED IT MOST,

585
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:27,753
SOMETHING I FAILED TO DO
FOR A FRIEND ONCE,

586
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:29,338
BUT EVER SINCE
THAT HAPPENED WITH HER,

587
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,006
I MADE A PROMISE
TO MYSELF THAT I

588
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:34,552
WOULD NEVER MAKE
THAT MISTAKE AGAIN.

589
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:36,178
THAT'S WHY WE WEAR THESE.

590
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:39,890
TO HONOR THAT PROMISE

591
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:44,061
AND THE BRAVERY
AND THE SACRIFICE

592
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:47,981
SHARED WITH THESE
AMAZING WOMEN,

593
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:54,113
WHO SOMEHOW...NO MATTER
HOW MANY TIMES THEY
GET KNOCKED DOWN...

594
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:56,532
THEY ALWAYS FIND
THE STRENGTH

595
00:26:56,574 --> 00:27:00,077
TO GET BACK UP
AND FIGHT AGAIN...

596
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:05,832
AND THAT IS EXACTLY
WHAT THE SURVIVING
CANARIES ARE GOING TO DO

597
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:09,545
TOGETHER BUT WHEN
THE TIME IS RIGHT.

598
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:18,845
IT'S TOO BAD
I'M NOT A CANARY.

599
00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:33,819
DANTE HAS BEEN
PULLING THE STRINGS
THIS ENTIRE TIME.

600
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,322
HE ORCHESTRATES
HER MOTHER'S MURDER,

601
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:39,825
AND HE SENDS HER
DOWN THIS PATH.

602
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:42,286
SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE
SOFTENING UP ON YOUR
SISTER AGAIN.

603
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:45,289
I JUST HAVE A BETTER
UNDERSTANDING OF WHY SHE'S
DONE WHAT SHE'S DONE.

604
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:48,542
WHEN EMIKO REALIZES
THAT DANTE HAS BEEN
MANIPULATING HER,

605
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:52,087
IT WILL DRIVE
A WEDGE BETWEEN HER
AND THE NINTH CIRCLE.

606
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,092
THAT'S HOW WE
STOP THEM.

607
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:07,727
SARA: THOUGHT I MIGHT
FIND YOU HERE.

608
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:10,063
IT'S PRETTY BRAVE
OF YOU,

609
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:12,399

WHAT YOU'VE HEARD
ABOUT ME,

620
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,264
BUT BASICALLY,
I HAD AN AFFAIR

621
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:46,392
WITH MY SISTER'S
BOYFRIEND,

622
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:50,229
I ALLOWED MY ENTIRE
FAMILY TO THINK
THAT I WAS DEAD,

623
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,648
AND THEN I BECAME
A LEAGUE-TRAINED

WOW. THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.

SOMEONE WITH A PAST

I WAS BEING A HERO.

629
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:06,328
I WAS THE D.A.,
I GOT OLIVER
OUT OF PRISON,

630
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:08,080
AND I WAS THE ONLY
ONE WHO FIGURED OUT

631
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:10,416
THAT HIS LITTLE SISTER
WAS BASICALLY THE DEVIL,

632
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:12,167
AND THEY STILL
TURNED ON ME.

633
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:14,961

YOU DESERVE A MEDAL

A DESTINATION.
IT'S A JOURNEY.

636
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:25,889

RUNNING AWAY

637
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:27,683
FROM ALL THE BAD THINGS
THAT I HAD DONE

638
00:29:27,725 --> 00:29:30,603
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT
TO FACE THE PAIN THAT
I HAD CAUSED

639
00:29:30,644 --> 00:29:34,106
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT
TO BE THAT PERSON,

640
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:40,153
AND THEN I REALIZED
THE ONLY WAY TO STOP
BEING THAT PERSON

641
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:42,155
WAS TO COME HOME
AND OWN UP

642
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:44,157
TO THE THINGS
THAT I HAD DONE,

AND, YEAH, IT WAS
PAINFUL,

AND IT TOOK
A REALLY LONG TIME,

645
00:29:49,622 --> 00:29:53,250
BUT IT WAS THE ONLY WAY
TO BECOME SOMEONE ELSE,

646
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:55,669
SOMEONE BETTER
THAN WHO I WAS.
