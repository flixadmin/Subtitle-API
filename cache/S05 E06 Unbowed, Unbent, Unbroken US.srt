1
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:59,197
-What are they doing with the bodies?
-Get back to work.

2
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:02,576
No. I've been here for weeks.

3
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,412
I'm not scrubbing one more corpse
until you tell me why I'm doing it.

4
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:07,873
You will know why.

5
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:11,960
-When?
-When it's time, not before.

6
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:14,087
Get back to work.

7
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:16,381
-When do I get to play the game?
-Game?

8
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,843
The game. The Game of Faces.

9
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,639
You tried already. You failed.

10
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:25,641
-I didn't even know I was playing.
-Who are you?

11
00:04:28,352 --> 00:04:29,227
No one.

12
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,898
-Get back to work.
-Who are you?

13
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:36,318
What are you doing here?
How did you get here?

14
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:40,697
I'm from Westeros just like you.

15
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:44,201
Daughter of a lord just like you.

16
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:47,162
Except I was an only child.

17
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,289
Heir to his fortune.

18
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:52,209
My mother died.

19
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,922
My father remarried and his new wife
gave birth to a girl.

20
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:02,260
My stepmother didn't want any rivals
for her precious daughter,

21
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,640
so she tried to kill me with poison.
I found out.

22
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:09,393
Sought help from the Faceless Men.

23
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,981
And my father was widowed again.

24
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:17,943
I've been serving them ever since.

25
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,708
Was that true or a lie?

26
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,047
-What?
-Did you believe every word I said?

27
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:45,512
Get back to work.

28
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:01,528
Who are you?

29
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:13,331
Who are you?

30
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:20,088
Arya.

31
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,551
-And where did you come from?
-Westeros.

32
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:33,060
My family home is Winterfell.
I'm the youngest daughter of a great lord,

33
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:36,354
Eddard Stark. He died in battle.

34
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,149
A lie.

35
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,985
After he was executed, I fled the capital.

36
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:47,032
Had to kill a stable boy.
Drove my sword through his back.

37
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:52,204
-A lie.
-I stabbed him in the gut.

38
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:56,208
I tried to find my mother and brother,
but I never did.

39
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,877
They were murdered by Walder Frey.

40
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:02,798
An outlaw kidnapped me,
a man called Polliver.

41
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:07,219
A man called the Hound. Sandor Clegane.

42
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:10,597
He tried to sell me,
but was wounded in a fight.

43
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:14,101
He begged me to kill him, but I wouldn't.
I left him in the mountains to die.

44
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,978
I wanted him to suffer. I hated him.

45
00:07:19,815 --> 00:07:20,941
I hated him.

46
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,693
That's not a lie!

47
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,405
A girl lies to me,

48
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:33,829
to the Many-Faced God, to herself.
Does she truly want to be no one?

49
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,248
Yes.

50
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:45,715
-I'm not playing this stupid game anymore!
-We never stop playing.

51
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:11,575
So those villages
we were supposed to find?

52
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,953
-We can't live on berries and roots.
-I can.

53
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,706
You're not hungry?

54
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:20,250
Of course I'm hungry.

55
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,503
You're an awful travelling companion,
do you know that?

56
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,589
Possibly the least charming man
I've ever met.

57
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,299
I'm not your travelling companion.

58
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,510
We are travelling together
in each other's company, therefore--

59
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:32,095
Do you ever shut up?

60
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:38,268
I sailed from King's Landing to Pentos
in a crate without ever saying a word.

61
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:39,853
Why?

62
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:45,984
It never occurred to you
to ask why until now?

63
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:53,200
You never wondered why Tyrion Lannister
decided to visit a brothel in Volantis?

64
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:55,952
I'm sure you visited many brothels
in many cities.

65
00:08:58,955 --> 00:08:59,915
I killed my father.

66
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:05,504
He wanted to execute me
for a crime I didn't commit.

67
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,759
And he was fucking the woman I loved.

68
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:24,648
As miserable as you are, Mormont,
at least your father was a good man.

69
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:28,693
-What do you know about my father?
-I met him. I visited the Wall.

70
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,613
When I asked him about his men…

71
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:35,325
he knew all their stories,
every one of them.

72
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:38,286
He actually cared about the people
under his command.

73
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:44,459
How do they put it in the Watch?
"We shall never see his like again."

74
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:58,181
Oh, you didn't know.

75
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:06,189
I'm sorry. I am.

76
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:10,402
How?

77
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:15,365
-I only know what I heard.
-How?

78
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,409
He was leading an expedition
beyond the Wall.

79
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,078
There was a mutiny.

80
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:23,331
He was murdered by his own men.

81
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:36,511
We better keep moving.

82
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,190
-Valarmorghulis.
-Valardohaeris.

83
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:33,902
I have nowhere else to go.

84
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:37,655
I've taken her to every healer in Braavos.

85
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,742
I've spent every penny I had.

86
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,416
She suffers every day of her life.

87
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,753
I just want it to end.

88
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:21,616
It hurts.

89
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:24,202
I know.

90
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:27,747
Don't be afraid.

91
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:30,375
I used to be like you.

92
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:33,795
I was sick.

93
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:36,673
I was dying.

94
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:43,972
But my father never gave up on me.

95
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:48,101
He loved me…

96
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,856
more than anything in the world,
just like your father loves you.

97
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,400
So he brought me here.

98
00:12:57,652 --> 00:12:59,612
My father prayed to the Many-Faced God.

99
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:04,159
And I drank the water from his fountain.

100
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:06,953
It healed me.

101
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:22,218
I've devoted my life to him now.

102
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,472
You don't want to hurt anymore?

103
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:29,684
Drink.

104
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:15,683
Is the girl ready?

105
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:20,188
To give up her ears, her nose, her tongue?

106
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:27,403
Her hopes and dreams, her loves and hates?
All that makes a girl who she is?

107
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:30,406
Forever?

108
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:35,870
No.

109
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:39,707
A girl is not ready to become no one.

110
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:47,840
But she is ready to become someone else.

111
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:04,232
Why Daenerys? Why is she worth all this?

112
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:09,529
As I recall, the Mormonts fought
against the Targaryens

113
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:10,697
during Robert's Rebellion.

114
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:15,243
-Do you believe in anything?
-I believe in lots of things.

115
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:19,330
In something greater than ourselves,
I mean. The gods, destiny.

116
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:22,083
Do you believe there's a plan
for this world?

117
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,128
No.

118
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:28,047
Neither did I.
I was a cynic just like you.

119
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:33,052
Then I saw a girl step into a great fire
with three stone eggs.

120
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,764
When the fire burned out,
I thought I'd find her blackened bones.

121
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:40,101
Instead, I saw her, Daenerys,

122
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:44,731
alive and unhurt,
holding her baby dragons.

123
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:51,279
-Have you ever heard baby dragons singing?
-No.

124
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,614
It's hard to be a cynic after that.

125
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,161
Doesn't mean she's going
to be a great queen.

126
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:02,749
-No, it doesn't.
-The Targaryens are famously insane.

127
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,917
What if she conquers the world? Then what?

128
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:09,839
-A 1,000 years of peace and prosperity?
-First we have to conquer the world.

129
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:11,299
We?

130
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:14,010
All right, let's assume
your dreams come true.

131
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:17,096
She's ecstatic when you bring her
this enemy dwarf.

132
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:20,224
She hacks off my head
and restores your position.

133
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,935
You command her army, sail to Westeros,

134
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:26,063
defeat all your enemies
and watch her climb those steps

135
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:29,567
and sit on the Iron Throne. Hurrah.
Long live the queen. Then what?

136
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:31,194
Then she rules.

137
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:34,697
So a woman who has not spent
a single day of her adult life

138
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:37,325
in Westeros becomes the ruler
of Westeros? That's justice?

139
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,660
-She's the rightful heir.
-Why?

140
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:43,581
Because her father, who burned living men
for amusement, was the king?

141
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:49,420
-That's a slave ship.
-Why are they anchored?

142
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:52,215
-They probably came ashore for--
-Water.

143
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:06,270
Got a lot of fight in you, huh?

144
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:16,656
Salt mines?

145
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:20,743
Yeah, that or a galley slave.

146
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:24,121
-He looks strong enough.
-What about the dwarf?

147
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:27,083
Worthless.

148
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:30,086
Cut his throat.

149
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,797
Wait. Wait. Wait, wait, wait!
Let's discuss this.

150
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,048
And then chop off his cock.

151
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:38,427
We'll sell it for a fortune.
A dwarf's cock has magic powers.

152
00:19:39,554 --> 00:19:43,474
Wait! Wait! Wait, wait, wait!
You can't just

153
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:46,394
hand a dry cock to a merchant
and expect him to pay for it.

154
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:48,312
He has to know it came from a dwarf.

155
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:51,858
And how could he know
unless he sees the dwarf?

156
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:55,111
-It will be a dwarf-sized cock.
-Guess again.

157
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:03,452
The dwarf lives until we find
a cock merchant.

158
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,672
Queen Daenerys has outlawed slavery.

159
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:17,133
We're bound for Volantis,
not Slaver's Bay.

160
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:21,220
Besides, she reopened the fighting pits.

161
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:24,140
I've never heard of free men
fighting in the pits.

162
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,434
The fighting pits in Meereen?

163
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:29,604
You're in luck, then.
You're about to be rich.

164
00:20:30,021 --> 00:20:32,315
You are looking at
one of the great warriors

165
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:33,524
in the Seven Kingdoms.

166
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:37,612
-Him.
-Him?

167
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:40,406
He's got to be 60 years old.

168
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:46,162
Sure, he's a bit long in the tooth,
a bit withered, been in the sun too long.

169
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:49,832
We can all see that.
But he is a veteran of 100 battles.

170
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,792
They wrote songs about him.

171
00:20:58,758 --> 00:20:59,634
That true?

172
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:10,770
He won the tournament at Lannisport.
Unseating Ser Jaime Lannister himself.

173
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:16,275
-The Kingslayer.
-Jousting.

174
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:20,947
You're talking about jousting.
A fancy game for fancy lads.

175
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:24,075
The men who fight in the pits of Meereen
will swallow him whole.

176
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:26,535
I killed a Dothraki bloodrider
in single combat.

177
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:41,592
-Liar.
-It's no lie. His name was Qotho.

178
00:21:41,676 --> 00:21:43,594
He was bloodrider to Khal Drogo.

179
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:48,182
Take me to Slaver's Bay,
put a sword in my hand,

180
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:49,976
I'll prove my worth.

181
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:04,323
For my children. Money.

182
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:11,664
-Lord Baelish.
-Yes?

183
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:15,835
Lancel Lannister.

184
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:22,299
Brother Lancel.
We abandon our family names.

185
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:23,843
Quite a family to abandon.

186
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:26,345
The city has changed
since you were here last.

187
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:30,725
We flooded the gutters with wine,
smashed the false idols,

188
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:33,227
and set the godless on the run.

189
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:35,771
Well done.

190
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,320
I'm here on urgent business
for the Queen Mother.

191
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,282
Should I send word that I'll be delayed?

192
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:54,457
Step carefully, Lord Baelish.
You'll find there's little tolerance

193
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,500
for flesh peddlers
in the new King's Landing.

194
00:22:56,917 --> 00:23:01,505
We both peddle fantasies, Brother Lancel.
Mine just happen to be entertaining.

195
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:16,562
Do you think it's wise, Your Grace,
arresting the heir to Highgarden?

196
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:19,315
The Faith arrested the heir to Highgarden.

197
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:22,485
Of course, and the Faith were armed
on your orders.

198
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:23,736
The king's orders.

199
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:26,655
Is the king to blame
for Ser Loras's perversion?

200
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:30,493
-House Tyrell won't tolerate this insult.
-House Tyrell won't tolerate it?

201
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:35,456
I'm the insulted party, Lord Baelish.
Ser Loras was promised to me.

202
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:37,541
Instead he chose the company of boys.

203
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:39,752
One's choice of companion
is a curious thing.

204
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:44,006
Most curious.

205
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:50,387
Lysa Arryn, for instance.
Thoroughly repellant woman.

206
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:55,101
Forgive me.
I know you're still in mourning.

207
00:23:56,727 --> 00:24:00,940
Lysa was a good woman. A kind woman.

208
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:03,150
She was neither of those things.
We both know it.

209
00:24:03,234 --> 00:24:04,944
Still, I pity her son.

210
00:24:06,028 --> 00:24:10,324
How fortunate the young Lord of the Vale
has a new father to counsel him.

211
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:11,867
I know how hard it can be

212
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:15,079
to lose both your parents
at such a young age.

213
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:17,081
If war comes to Westeros,
will the Knights of the Vale

214
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:21,210
-fight for their king?
-Young Lord Robin heeds my advice.

215
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,464
And I have always counseled
loyalty to the throne.

216
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:26,799
Good.

217
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:33,139
If there's nothing else.

218
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:36,851
There is another matter, Your Grace.

219
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:39,186
Something so urgent I couldn't trust
the words to a raven.

220
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:42,231
You once charged me
with finding Arya Stark.

221
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:44,066
To my shame, I failed you.

222
00:24:45,776 --> 00:24:47,319
But I have found Sansa Stark.

223
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:53,951
Alive and well and home again
living at Winterfell.

224
00:24:54,702 --> 00:24:58,038
-That's not possible.
-My sources are well placed.

225
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:04,044
They tell me Roose Bolton
plans to marry her to his son Ramsay,

226
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:07,047
a bastard recently legitimized
by King Tommen.

227
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:11,010
Roose Bolton is Warden of the North
by the grace of my father.

228
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:14,805
Indeed, his reward for stabbing
his own king in the heart.

229
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,517
We were fools to trust a turn cloak.

230
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:22,730
Marrying his son to the last of the Starks
gives him more legitimacy in the North

231
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:24,815
than an alliance
with a hated southern house.

232
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:30,279
I will skin him and his bastard
like that wretch on their bloody sigil.

233
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,865
-I would counsel patience, Your Grace.
-Patience?

234
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:36,869
Sansa helped murder my son.
Roose Bolton is a traitor.

235
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:40,706
Stannis Baratheon is also a traitor,
marching with his army on Winterfell.

236
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:42,708
Let Stannis and Roose battle.

237
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,794
Let the enemies
of the throne slaughter each other.

238
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:49,089
And when they're done, seize Winterfell
from whichever thief survives.

239
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:51,634
Winterfell is 1,000 miles away from here.

240
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:56,513
-The weather has already begun to turn.
-That is why it is critical to strike soon

241
00:25:56,931 --> 00:25:58,724
while the victor still licks his wounds.

242
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:03,604
Surely your Uncle Kevan
could muster a force.

243
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:06,732
My Uncle Kevan has all the courage
of a kitchen mouse.

244
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:08,067
Ser Jaime, then.

245
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,736
Jaime's away
on a sensitive diplomatic mission.

246
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:15,115
-I have no idea when he'll be back.
-Perhaps I can help.

247
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:19,453
The Knights of the Vale
are some of the best fighters in Westeros,

248
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:21,997
trained to battle in the ice and the snow.

249
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:23,499
Forgive me, Lord Baelish…

250
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:29,380
you have a reputation as a money lender
and a brothel keeper, not a military man.

251
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,091
You wouldn't risk
a single Lannister soldier

252
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:36,220
or a single coin from the royal treasury.
What do you have to lose?

253
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:40,224
-A brothel keeper?
-And if you succeed?

254
00:26:40,641 --> 00:26:42,393
Name me Warden of the North.

255
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:48,941
I'll speak to the king this evening,

256
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:52,111
have him issue a royal decree.

257
00:26:52,987 --> 00:26:55,364
I'll not rest until the lion flies
over Winterfell.

258
00:26:55,906 --> 00:27:00,786
And I'll know you're a man of your word
when I see Sansa Stark's head on a spike.

259
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:04,540
As I said, I live to serve.

260
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:13,215
I'm going to ask him tomorrow.

261
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:18,470
-What if he says no?
-He won't. We've waited long enough.

262
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:22,683
I want you to be my wife. Now.

263
00:27:25,436 --> 00:27:26,562
What is it?

264
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:29,440
Do you want to marry me
because our families arranged it?

265
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:30,774
Or do you--

266
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:42,202
-We can't. Not yet.
-Why not?

267
00:27:42,745 --> 00:27:46,749
-You know why not. Someone will see.
-You are going to be my wife.

268
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:50,461
I am going to be your husband.

269
00:27:51,754 --> 00:27:53,964
We're allowed to walk through
the gardens together.

270
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:57,134
How many other girls have you walked
through these gardens?

271
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:02,556
I like the way your eyes go squinty
when you're jealous.

272
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:05,642
They do not go squinty
and you didn't answer the question.

273
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:10,731
They make a lovely couple.
A Lannister and a Martell.

274
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:14,568
They have no idea how dangerous that is.

275
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:18,781
-We must protect them.
-Yes, my prince.

276
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:23,619
You haven't had to use
that axe of yours in a long time.

277
00:28:25,788 --> 00:28:29,166
-I hope you remember how.
-I remember how.

278
00:28:32,753 --> 00:28:36,507
The Dornishman's wife
Was as fair as the sun

279
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:40,427
And her kisses were warmer than spring

280
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:45,933
The Dornishman's blade
It was made of black steel

281
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:49,603
And its kiss was a terrible thing

282
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:54,066
The Dornishman's wife
Would sing as she bathed

283
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:57,152
In a voice that was sweet as a peach

284
00:28:57,236 --> 00:29:00,155
-All right, that's enough.
-I'm coming to the best part.

285
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:02,116
We're trying to blend in.

286
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,493
Don't want everyone in Dorne
to hear your accent.

287
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:08,497
-This song really is all about the ending.
-It can wait. There.

288
00:29:12,668 --> 00:29:13,877
That's the Water Gardens.

289
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:16,380
And once we've got the princess,
then what?

290
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:20,467
I like to improvise.

291
00:29:22,136 --> 00:29:23,762
That explains the golden hand.

292
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:45,242
Unbowed.

293
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:46,326
Unbent.

294
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:47,870
Unbroken.

295
00:29:49,997 --> 00:29:50,914
For Oberyn.

296
00:29:51,457 --> 00:29:52,583
-For Oberyn.
-For Oberyn.

297
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:33,957
Well, she's made herself at home.

298
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:41,340
Myrcella.

299
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:47,471
Uncle Jaime? I…

300
00:30:49,223 --> 00:30:51,266
I don't understand.
What are you doing here?

301
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,351
Let's speak in private.

302
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:56,146
-I am Trystane Martell.
-Trystane is my intended.

303
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:58,774
Excellent. Good to meet you.

304
00:30:59,233 --> 00:31:00,859
We weren't expecting you, Lord Jaime.

305
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:02,986
Why don't you let them
have some time alone, son?

306
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,327
Let's not do something stupid.

307
00:31:15,666 --> 00:31:18,585
-That was something stupid.
-We have to go, Myrcella, now.

308
00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:20,712
-You hurt him!
-He'll be fine, I promise.

309
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:22,130
But we have to--

310
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:27,553
Oh, for fuck's sake.

311
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,763
Take her!

312
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:15,601
-You're coming with me.
-I don't want to.

313
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:17,394
I wasn't asking, princess.

314
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:27,029
Drop your weapons!

315
00:32:35,537 --> 00:32:40,125
I am Obara Sand.
Daughter of Oberyn Martell.

316
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:45,339
-I fight for Dorne. Who do you fight for?
-Drop your weapons.

317
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:06,443
When you were whole,
it would have been a good fight.

318
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:19,247
You fight pretty good for a little girl.

319
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:47,401
Halt!

320
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:53,865
Oh, you can smell the shit
from five miles away.

321
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,618
Well, why have we stopped? Go on.

322
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:04,876
Rumors and gossip, that's all they've got.
It's theater, nothing more.

323
00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:08,839
If they arrested all the pillow biters
in King's Landing,

324
00:34:08,922 --> 00:34:11,633
there'd be no room left
in the dungeons for anyone else.

325
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:13,301
Everyone knew about him and Renly.

326
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:16,930
Renly Baratheon shagged half
the stable boys in the Seven Kingdoms.

327
00:34:17,264 --> 00:34:19,015
Everyone knew, no one cared.

328
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:22,394
-But he was the king's brother.
-And Loras is the queen's brother.

329
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:24,688
No, no, no, no. This is unacceptable.

330
00:34:25,105 --> 00:34:26,898
-Cersei's behind it.
-Yeah, of course she is.

331
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:30,610
She wants to drag our name
through the dirt, put us in our place.

332
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:35,157
Get some rest, dear. You look appalling.
And let me deal with Cersei Lannister.

333
00:34:42,122 --> 00:34:47,210
-Your Grace, I have travelled a long way.
-You must be exhausted.

334
00:34:50,297 --> 00:34:52,924
Put the pen down, dear.
We both know you're not writing anything.

335
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:56,386
Ah, yes. The famously tart-tongued
Queen of Thorns.

336
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:58,930
And the famous tart Queen Cersei.

337
00:35:03,727 --> 00:35:04,644
I beg your pardon?

338
00:35:04,728 --> 00:35:08,315
I know you're behind this absurd
incarceration of my grandson.

339
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:10,650
If you apologize for that comment,
perhaps I'll--

340
00:35:10,734 --> 00:35:13,695
You'll get your apology when I get Loras.

341
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:18,700
I was as shocked as anyone
when the Faith arrested Ser Loras.

342
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:23,705
I have no love for these fanatics,
but what can a Queen Mother do?

343
00:35:26,208 --> 00:35:28,335
Has the crown suddenly stopped needing

344
00:35:28,418 --> 00:35:31,630
the troops, gold, and wheat
my house supplies?

345
00:35:31,713 --> 00:35:35,383
I can assure you,
our alliance with House Tyrell remains--

346
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:36,676
Do you expect the alliance to continue

347
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:39,638
after you've thrown
our future into prison?

348
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:44,184
As I said, I didn't imprison anyone.

349
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:47,604
-As for your veiled threats--
-What veil?

350
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:53,735
The Lannister-Tyrell alliance
brought peace to a war-torn country.

351
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:56,488
Do you really want to see
the Seven Kingdoms

352
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:57,656
slide back into warfare?

353
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:05,163
I didn't trust your father.
I didn't particularly like him.

354
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:08,458
But I respected him. He was no fool.

355
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:12,671
He understood that sometimes
we must work with our rivals

356
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:16,383
-rather than destroy them.
-House Lannister has no rival.

357
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:22,055
The High Septon has called
for an inquest, not a trial.

358
00:36:22,556 --> 00:36:24,099
Just a small hearing to determine

359
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,685
whether the charges
against Loras have merit,

360
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,186
which I'm sure they don't.

361
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:32,482
Loras will be freed,
our happy alliance will continue…

362
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,653
and we'll forget this unfortunate
conversation ever happened.

363
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,365
Good day, Lady Olenna.

364
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:02,637
You are aware of the rumors
concerning you and Renly?

365
00:37:04,306 --> 00:37:05,891
I don't pay attention to rumors.

366
00:37:06,892 --> 00:37:09,352
You were said to be despondent
when he died.

367
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:13,523
Witnesses state that you refused
to leave his bedside

368
00:37:13,607 --> 00:37:15,609
even as Stannis's army closed in.

369
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:19,863
He was my friend. He was my king.

370
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:22,532
Wasn't Joffrey your king?

371
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,201
He was anointed by the Seven, not Renly.

372
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:29,748
I was wrong to support Renly's claim,
I know that.

373
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:32,918
But I was forgiven by Joffrey.

374
00:37:34,294 --> 00:37:36,046
I fought for him
at the Battle of Blackwater.

375
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:38,882
Yes, wearing Renly's armor.

376
00:37:40,634 --> 00:37:43,678
-Why does it matter what I wore?
-Do you deny all the charges against you?

377
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:49,100
Fornication. Buggery. Blasphemy.

378
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:52,812
-Of course I deny them.
-You never lay with Renly Baratheon?

379
00:37:53,647 --> 00:37:56,399
-Never.
-Nor any other man?

380
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:58,568
Never.

381
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:03,281
That will be all, Ser Loras.

382
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:13,583
Well, I think that's quite enough of that.

383
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,211
The Faith calls Queen Margaery forward.

384
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:20,632
-You call me forward?
-Yes, we have some questions for you.

385
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:24,260
-I am the queen.
-You are.

386
00:38:25,095 --> 00:38:27,138
And according to the law of the Seven,

387
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:32,268
neither kings nor queens are exempt
from testimony at a holy inquest.

388
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:53,748
How do you respond to these charges
against your brother?

389
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:55,750
They are lies.

390
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:57,836
-All of them?
-All of them.

391
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:02,507
Queen Margaery,
in the presence of the gods,

392
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:06,094
do you swear that your brother is innocent
of these charges against him

393
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:09,514
-to the best of your knowledge?
-Yes, I swear it.

394
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:13,309
Thank you, Your Grace.

395
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:40,628
Do you know this man?

396
00:39:42,005 --> 00:39:44,174
Yes, very well.

397
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:47,052
He is Ser Loras Tyrell,
heir to Highgarden.

398
00:39:48,345 --> 00:39:51,890
-How did you come to meet?
-I squired for him.

399
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:56,686
He took a liking to me. He summoned me
to his chamber the first day we met.

400
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,858
And what occurred in his chamber?

401
00:40:02,484 --> 00:40:06,321
We engaged in intimate relations.

402
00:40:07,697 --> 00:40:08,615
You lay with him?

403
00:40:09,282 --> 00:40:12,786
-That night and many others.
-Liar. He's a liar.

404
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:16,247
Is there anyone else
who can support your claim?

405
00:40:17,457 --> 00:40:20,376
Yes. Yes, Queen Margaery.

406
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:26,716
She walked in on us once not long ago.
She didn't seem surprised.

407
00:40:28,051 --> 00:40:31,304
This testimony is an insult
to a great house.

408
00:40:31,805 --> 00:40:35,141
Why should the Faith or anyone else
take the word of a squire

409
00:40:35,225 --> 00:40:37,977
-over the heir to Highgarden?
-He has a birthmark, Your Grace.

410
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:40,730
Quite high on his thigh.

411
00:40:41,898 --> 00:40:44,150
Wine-colored and roughly
the shape of Dorne.

412
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:46,778
No! Liar!

413
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:52,659
What are you doing? Let us pass.

414
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:55,620
The Faith is satisfied
there is enough evidence

415
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:58,915
to bring a formal trial for Ser Loras

416
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:02,085
-and Queen Margaery.
-What?

417
00:41:03,253 --> 00:41:06,840
Bearing false witness before the gods
is as grave a sin as any, my lady.

418
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:09,926
-Take her.
-No.

419
00:41:11,136 --> 00:41:13,138
Tommen. Tommen!

420
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:19,602
You can't do this. I am the queen.
Tommen! Tommen!

421
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:23,523
I am your queen. How dare you?
Take your hands off me!

422
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:26,943
Tommen!

423
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:51,426
What do you want?

424
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:54,888
Lord Ramsay sent me
to draw you a bath, my lady.

425
00:41:56,264 --> 00:41:58,933
You want to be clean and fresh
for your new husband, don't you?

426
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:20,747
You're so beautiful,
but you need to keep him happy.

427
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:24,918
Ramsay gets bored easily.

428
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:28,296
You don't want to end up like…

429
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:32,467
well, like the others.

430
00:42:34,177 --> 00:42:37,013
-What others?
-I shouldn't gossip.

431
00:42:38,348 --> 00:42:39,599
It's good to see the red again.

432
00:42:40,934 --> 00:42:43,269
-No point hiding anymore.
-What others?

433
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:48,149
Let's see, there was Kyra,
the blacksmith's daughter.

434
00:42:48,942 --> 00:42:51,694
She was tall like you, lovely figure. But…

435
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:58,534
she talked and talked and talked
and Ramsay grew tired of that.

436
00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:04,207
Then there was Violet.
She had gorgeous blonde hair.

437
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:09,921
But she got pregnant.
And, well, that was boring.

438
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:15,343
Then Tansy. Such a sweet girl.

439
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:20,098
Of course, sweet girls get a bit dull

440
00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:22,475
after a while, don't they?

441
00:43:23,184 --> 00:43:26,145
-Ramsay let me come with him on that hunt.
-Hunt?

442
00:43:30,275 --> 00:43:33,361
Have you ever seen a body
after the dogs have been at it?

443
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:36,322
Not so pretty.

444
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:43,788
But, well, it's your wedding day.
Why am I talking about such things?

445
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:49,210
-What was your name again?
-Myranda.

446
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:54,215
And how long have you loved him, Myranda?

447
00:43:58,845 --> 00:44:01,222
Did you imagine that he would be
with you forever, is that it?

448
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:03,224
And I came along and ruined it.

449
00:44:06,978 --> 00:44:08,938
I'm Sansa Stark of Winterfell.

450
00:44:10,565 --> 00:44:13,985
This is my home and you can't frighten me.

451
00:44:20,825 --> 00:44:22,952
Are you done with your bath, my lady?

452
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:25,621
Go. I can finish on my own.

453
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,232
Yes?

454
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:05,036
I've come to escort you
to the godswood, my lady.

455
00:45:10,041 --> 00:45:12,877
If you please, my lady,
will you take my arm?

456
00:45:13,378 --> 00:45:14,212
No.

457
00:45:16,381 --> 00:45:18,966
Lord Ramsay, he said I'm to take your arm.

458
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:20,176
I'm not touching you.

459
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,765
Please. He'll punish me.

460
00:45:28,393 --> 00:45:30,395
You think I care what he does to you?

461
00:46:48,556 --> 00:46:50,516
Who comes before the old gods this night?

462
00:46:52,435 --> 00:46:54,979
Sansa of the House Stark…

463
00:46:56,731 --> 00:46:57,899
comes here to be wed.

464
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:03,905
A woman grown, trueborn and noble.

465
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:07,700
She comes to beg
the blessings of the gods.

466
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:12,288
Who comes to claim her?

467
00:47:21,756 --> 00:47:23,174
Ramsay of House Bolton.

468
00:47:25,009 --> 00:47:27,220
Heir to the Dreadfort and Winterfell.

469
00:47:29,889 --> 00:47:30,807
Who gives her?

470
00:47:34,727 --> 00:47:38,940
Theon of House Greyjoy, who was…

471
00:47:43,945 --> 00:47:45,321
who was her father's ward.

472
00:47:48,074 --> 00:47:51,118
Lady Sansa, will you take this man?

473
00:48:21,524 --> 00:48:22,400
I take this man.

474
00:48:54,974 --> 00:48:56,434
Are you pleased, my lady?

475
00:48:59,854 --> 00:49:01,939
Good. I want you to be happy.

476
00:49:12,992 --> 00:49:14,910
My father said you're still a virgin.

477
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,169
-Yes.
-Why?

478
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:29,216
Why are you still a virgin?

479
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:32,720
Afraid of dwarves?

480
00:49:34,555 --> 00:49:39,560
Lord… Lord Tyrion was kind.
He was gentle. He never touched me.

481
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:44,607
-You're not lying to me?
-No, my lord.

482
00:49:45,066 --> 00:49:47,234
Lying to your husband
on his wedding night,

483
00:49:48,569 --> 00:49:50,863
that would be a bad way
to start a marriage.

484
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:57,870
We're man and wife now.

485
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:00,748
We should be honest with each other.

486
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:02,958
Don't you think?

487
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:05,503
Yes.

488
00:50:16,597 --> 00:50:17,431
Good.

489
00:50:20,685 --> 00:50:21,560
Take off your clothes.

490
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:27,191
Oh, no, no, no.

491
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:30,111
You stay here, Reek.

492
00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:32,530
You watch.

493
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:49,964
Do I need to ask a second time?
I hate asking a second time.

494
00:51:18,868 --> 00:51:22,371
Reek, I told you to watch.

495
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:31,046
You've known Sansa since she was a girl.

496
00:51:33,299 --> 00:51:34,633
Now watch her become a woman.
