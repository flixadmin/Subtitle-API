1
00:00:08,384 --> 00:00:10,803
- This way.
- No, the compass says this way.

2
00:00:10,887 --> 00:00:15,808
- The sun says east is this way.
- I concur. Captain Cruz is correct.

3
00:00:15,892 --> 00:00:18,520
Gideon sure got chatty as a human.

4
00:00:19,521 --> 00:00:22,166
I've been counting my steps since we
left your mother's house, Ms. Cruz.

5
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:24,651
And if my calculations
and your bearings are correct,

6
00:00:24,776 --> 00:00:26,253
then we should have
almost reached the...

7
00:00:26,277 --> 00:00:29,656
Highway. Like I said, east.

8
00:00:29,948 --> 00:00:32,825
If we can hail a driver taking a direct
route within the next half hour,

9
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:35,495
we'll get as far as the Texas border
by nightfall.

10
00:00:35,578 --> 00:00:37,890
We would be on the road already
if you'd let me steal that car

11
00:00:37,914 --> 00:00:39,123
instead of hitchhiking.

12
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:41,501
What time is it?

13
00:00:44,379 --> 00:00:46,923
- About 1:00, I reckon.
- How?

14
00:00:47,674 --> 00:00:49,008
The sun also tells time.

15
00:00:49,509 --> 00:00:54,055
- Ooh. What else can it do, I wonder?
- Makes you blind if you keep staring.

16
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,732
Oh. Hello.

17
00:01:06,985 --> 00:01:08,027
What is it?

18
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,283
Ah! Strawberry rhubarb. My favorite.

19
00:01:13,366 --> 00:01:14,617
Ah!

20
00:01:15,243 --> 00:01:19,998
- Gideon, be a dear and grab that pie.
- I'm not sure I can do that.

21
00:01:23,918 --> 00:01:25,920
Since when are you allowed
to refuse orders?

22
00:01:26,004 --> 00:01:27,380
Since you turned her into a human.

23
00:01:27,463 --> 00:01:29,275
It's all right, Gideon.
You don't got to do what you don't want.

24
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:31,694
Counterpoint. We're not gonna
stop our friends from getting blown up

25
00:01:31,718 --> 00:01:33,428
on an empty stomach. Grab the pie.

26
00:01:33,511 --> 00:01:35,346
Gideon, you decide for yourself.

27
00:01:35,722 --> 00:01:37,682
- Me?
- Yeah. Which is it, Gideon?

28
00:01:39,058 --> 00:01:40,435
You have a point.

29
00:01:40,518 --> 00:01:42,746
Uh, without sustenance,
we won't be able to save the Legends.

30
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,607
- See? Let's grab it.
- However, according to my records,

31
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:47,501
that pie was baked by one
Miss Adelaide Van Zandt.

32
00:01:47,525 --> 00:01:48,526
Never heard of her.

33
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:51,237
Who goes on to win the blue ribbon
at the 1925 Pasco County Fair

34
00:01:51,321 --> 00:01:52,363
pie-baking contest.

35
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:55,283
- That pie is historically significant.
- We can't steal it.

36
00:01:55,366 --> 00:01:57,785
- It's just a damn pie.
- We can't disrupt the timeline.

37
00:01:58,119 --> 00:01:59,763
But I must do everything I can
to aid the Legends.

38
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:02,165
Except stealing is morally wrong.
I've never tried rhubarb.

39
00:02:02,248 --> 00:02:05,418
Steal the pie. Don't steal it.
Don't... Pie...

40
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:11,382
- You broke Gideon. You happy?
- Oh, just grab her feet.

41
00:02:17,138 --> 00:02:19,932
We won't even get to the Legends
with Gideon constantly crashing.

42
00:02:20,433 --> 00:02:24,520
- You either reboot her or we leave her.
- Crashing? Reboot? She's a person.

43
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:26,981
Okay. Well, if she's a person,

44
00:02:27,148 --> 00:02:29,748
then can you use your powers
and figure out what's wrong with her?

45
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:42,264
Yeah, but you don't need powers

46
00:02:42,288 --> 00:02:44,266
to see that she ain't just knocked out
like last time.

47
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:46,084
Can't you use your magic
to figure it out?

48
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:47,710
Nope.

49
00:02:49,045 --> 00:02:52,465
Okay, there is a spell that will
allow me to enter Gideon's mind,

50
00:02:52,715 --> 00:02:55,301
but I can't make it back out again
without her leading the way.

51
00:02:55,385 --> 00:02:56,511
Okay, fine. I'll join you.

52
00:02:57,178 --> 00:03:00,223
Look if we're stuck,
then we'll be stuck together.

53
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:05,228
In a comatose woman's brain?
In a barn? In Texas? Come on.

54
00:03:05,311 --> 00:03:07,563
Without Gideon, how are we
supposed to find Gwyn Davies,

55
00:03:07,647 --> 00:03:09,649
and stop the Legends
from finding him first?

56
00:03:12,902 --> 00:03:14,737
Okay. All-righty.

57
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:30,294
Well, either the spell didn't work,

58
00:03:30,378 --> 00:03:33,131
or the inside of Gideon's head
looks an awful lot like a barn.

59
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:36,259
Did I say <i>"fiat"?</i> I meant <i>"fiet."</i>

60
00:03:54,485 --> 00:03:57,488
Gideon? Hello?

61
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,495
That ain't the Temporal Zone.

62
00:04:06,497 --> 00:04:09,184
Well, you
certainly know your stuff, don't you?

63
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,878
Those are all of Gideon's memories
out there.

64
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:16,132
And it seems like they got corrupted
when her brain got overwhelmed.

65
00:04:17,508 --> 00:04:20,803
So you guys here to help me
get the old girl up and running again?

66
00:04:21,512 --> 00:04:22,764
Who the hell are you?

67
00:04:23,973 --> 00:04:26,517
Jefferson Jackson, but just call me Jax.

68
00:04:42,867 --> 00:04:44,410
Wake up, sir.

69
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:52,710
Sir? Uh, the press and investors
have already started to gather.

70
00:04:52,794 --> 00:04:56,589
Today's the big day.
Your AVA clone launch, sir.

71
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,135
- Yes? Here you are.
- Yeah.

72
00:05:01,803 --> 00:05:04,055
Now, would you like to go over
your keynote again? Or...

73
00:05:04,138 --> 00:05:06,057
Good idea, Assistant Ava.

74
00:05:09,435 --> 00:05:10,436
Okay. Uh...

75
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:14,398
You all stand with me
at the dawn of a new era

76
00:05:15,024 --> 00:05:18,194
to witness the arrival
of something huge.

77
00:05:20,696 --> 00:05:23,950
- Sir, are you okay?
- Huh? What? No, it's nothing.

78
00:05:25,493 --> 00:05:26,536
Um...

79
00:05:27,203 --> 00:05:29,097
To witness the arrival
of something huge.

80
00:05:30,248 --> 00:05:31,568
Because what I'm about to show...

81
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:36,212
Because what I'm about to show you
is like nothing you've ever seen.

82
00:05:43,219 --> 00:05:45,847
Oh, my goodness. Are you...
Are you okay?

83
00:05:48,808 --> 00:05:50,568
Can I share a secret with you,
Assistant Ava?

84
00:05:51,394 --> 00:05:56,107
I've been having the strangest visions
of these, um... lizard people.

85
00:05:57,149 --> 00:06:00,945
No, more than visions.
They feel like memories.

86
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:07,285
It doesn't make any sense.
But, uh, I think they're tied to this.

87
00:06:08,786 --> 00:06:09,996
Sir, that isn't your keynote.

88
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:13,332
Huh? No, it's code.
But not just any code.

89
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,003
It's from the future. Check this out.

90
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:20,756
The source of the code.

91
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:25,011
Some sort of
next-next-next-gen hard drive.

92
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:29,223
You'll never guess where it came from.
My lab coat.

93
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:32,351
How interesting. Maybe after you're...

94
00:06:32,435 --> 00:06:34,395
Exactly one year ago,
I fell asleep on that couch.

95
00:06:34,687 --> 00:06:38,149
When I woke up, this was in my lab coat.

96
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:42,069
What if it holds the key to unlocking
my mysterious lizard visions?

97
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,790
Uh, it took me ages to build an
interface for software this advanced.

98
00:06:45,823 --> 00:06:50,411
But finally, I am at the precipice
of understanding what the device does.

99
00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:54,123
If I could just wrap my mind
around this code.

100
00:06:58,294 --> 00:06:59,420
So you're Jax?

101
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:02,298
Yep. The better looking
half of Firestorm

102
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:04,342
and the ship's mechanic extraordinaire,

103
00:07:04,425 --> 00:07:05,509
at your service, ladies.

104
00:07:06,636 --> 00:07:08,179
So I take it you two are Legends then.

105
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:09,823
Well, they never told
us you were British.

106
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:13,434
I'm not. This is just how Gideon decided
to remember me for some reason.

107
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:14,685
But I don't mind.

108
00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:16,872
I mean, everything sounds better
in a British accent, dunnit?

109
00:07:16,896 --> 00:07:17,897
Debatable.

110
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,608
- So you're a memory?
- The last remaining.

111
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:24,987
I spent so much time working on Gideon
that I must have been protected here

112
00:07:25,071 --> 00:07:26,197
in her subconscious.

113
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,200
Now, I mean, I can't say the same
for the rest of you chumps, but...

114
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:31,369
- Look what you did to her.
- Me?

115
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:33,913
You are the one
who forced the decision on her.

116
00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:35,236
Clearly she couldn't handle it.

117
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:37,768
We're in a hurry. Can you just
get her up and running and...

118
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:41,629
Uh, not so simple. Um, you see this?

119
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:45,675
This is her prefrontal cortex and it
houses all of her short-term memories.

120
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:48,511
And as you can see,
hers has been completely wiped.

121
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,598
And this is the subconscious.
That's where we are.

122
00:07:52,807 --> 00:07:55,393
It's kind of like a stronghold.
It's buried so deep

123
00:07:55,476 --> 00:07:57,937
that it was able to be protected
when she melted down.

124
00:07:58,688 --> 00:07:59,939
What's going on here?

125
00:08:00,356 --> 00:08:02,858
That is Gideon's long-term memories.

126
00:08:02,942 --> 00:08:04,662
Now, while everything else
was being erased,

127
00:08:04,735 --> 00:08:06,362
she was able to hold on
to a few moments.

128
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:09,865
Problem is, she can't access them
on her own.

129
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:13,202
All right. Well, what happens
if you just wake her up?

130
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:15,871
- Without her memories?
- Mm-hmm.

131
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,000
Well,
it would be like a factory reset.

132
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:21,836
She'd be back to who she was
before she knew any of us.

133
00:08:22,086 --> 00:08:23,629
But she'd still be a supercomputer?

134
00:08:23,713 --> 00:08:26,007
Well, sure,
she'd have her basic functions

135
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:27,800
and her knowledge of the timeline.

136
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:29,885
That's all built in.
But her personality...

137
00:08:29,969 --> 00:08:32,972
So she'd have all the information
but none of the annoying human bits?

138
00:08:33,139 --> 00:08:35,933
- That's perfect. Let's do it.
- No. No, don't do it.

139
00:08:36,392 --> 00:08:38,620
We have to get out of here, Spooner.
We have to save the team.

140
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:40,896
Not without Gideon. Our Gideon.

141
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:45,026
How do we bring her back?

142
00:08:45,818 --> 00:08:47,778
Well, these key memories
are all we've got,

143
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:52,199
so I guess the only place to start
is helping her access those

144
00:08:52,408 --> 00:08:53,701
by visiting them with her.

145
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:57,163
So you're gonna send us
inside Gideon's head

146
00:08:57,288 --> 00:08:59,623
even though we're already
inside Gideon's head?

147
00:08:59,915 --> 00:09:02,334
Okay, there's a reason
why I skip Christopher Nolan movies.

148
00:09:02,418 --> 00:09:04,378
Let's just not overthink things.

149
00:09:05,004 --> 00:09:06,505
Just tell us what you need us to do.

150
00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:11,052
Well, I would suggest
that we start with a recent memory.

151
00:09:11,135 --> 00:09:13,220
This one is from a year ago.

152
00:09:13,304 --> 00:09:14,972
I'd suggest that
you hold on to something.

153
00:09:15,056 --> 00:09:16,057
Wait...

154
00:09:19,143 --> 00:09:20,143
What?

155
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:21,979
Is that me?

156
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,775
What? What the hell? Now I'm in a coma?

157
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:29,111
No. You're in Gideon's memory.
I thought I explained that.

158
00:09:29,195 --> 00:09:33,032
Wait. This must be the night
that we kidnapped... Recruited you.

159
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:36,577
Why don't I remember this?

160
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:39,163
- Gideon.
- Who are you?

161
00:09:40,331 --> 00:09:41,624
She doesn't remember us, Jax.

162
00:09:41,707 --> 00:09:45,753
<i>Are you always this impatient? She has
to experience the key memory first.</i>

163
00:09:46,295 --> 00:09:51,217
- Ava. It's so good to see you.
- She can't see us, obviously.

164
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:52,968
How's our patient doing today, Gideon?

165
00:09:53,052 --> 00:09:56,013
<i>The dart that Mr. Rory shot her with
should wear off at any moment.</i>

166
00:09:56,764 --> 00:10:00,935
Come on, Gideon. There must be a reason
you held on to this one. Remember.

167
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:06,607
I remember what happened now.

168
00:10:08,651 --> 00:10:10,691
Would you like me to administer
additional sedation?

169
00:10:11,362 --> 00:10:14,532
I don't know. Honestly, Gideon,
I don't know what I'm doing.

170
00:10:14,782 --> 00:10:15,967
Kidnapping people from history?

171
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:17,868
It goes against everything
I was ever taught.

172
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,954
It's working.

173
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:24,917
Ever since Sara was kidnapped,
I feel like I'm just grasping at straws.

174
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,378
But this might be the last straw.

175
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,841
I didn't want to say anything but the
odds that a paranoid alien enthusiast

176
00:10:31,924 --> 00:10:33,008
with a love of firearms...

177
00:10:33,092 --> 00:10:37,221
Yes, I know what the odds are, Gideon.
But if there's a one in a billion chance

178
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:39,723
that this person can help me
find Sara, I have to take it.

179
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:43,894
Now, I know it doesn't make any sense,
but love isn't logical.

180
00:10:47,148 --> 00:10:48,357
I actually understand.

181
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:52,945
- You do?
- I really miss Sara, too.

182
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:58,409
Stop it, Gideon.
You're gonna make me cry.

183
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:02,955
Thanks, Gideon. Let's wake her up, huh?

184
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:09,086
Gideon.

185
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:11,964
Ms. Cruz. Ms. Logue.

186
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:13,465
- You're here.
- You remember us.

187
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:16,051
I safeguarded that memory
because it's when Captain Sharpe

188
00:11:16,135 --> 00:11:19,305
convinced me to prioritize love
over logic, which is how I met you.

189
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:23,225
Hey, guys, when you accessed
her key memory,

190
00:11:23,309 --> 00:11:25,769
the other memories around it
started repopulating.

191
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:30,858
- Hey, Jax, fancy a cuppa?
- Always time for a cuppa, Gideon.

192
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:34,403
Now is clearly not the time for tea.
Can we get out of here?

193
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:38,449
Uh, well, not yet. Not exactly.
You only got one key memory.

194
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:43,037
- You still have to recover the others.
- The others. Right.

195
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:45,473
I held on to these memories
because they're the moments

196
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:49,293
that made me who I am.
I still can't recall what's in them.

197
00:11:49,585 --> 00:11:52,189
Well, if you do want to restore them,
you're gonna have to go back.

198
00:11:52,213 --> 00:11:57,259
You're all going to have to go way back.
Get ready to meet the OGs.

199
00:12:03,224 --> 00:12:06,518
Ah, breakfast, the most important meal
of the day.

200
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,651
Mmm. Just how I like them. Poached.

201
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:16,570
- Uh, those are mine.
- Did I mention I'm a thief?

202
00:12:16,946 --> 00:12:18,155
No time for breakfast.

203
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:20,658
What the hell?

204
00:12:21,116 --> 00:12:25,454
We must avenge the death
of my son and Rip's son, I think.

205
00:12:26,205 --> 00:12:28,916
Which one of you threw that, huh? You?

206
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,794
- Who are these guys?
- Wish I knew.

207
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,647
- And what is Sara wearing?
- Uh, you got some egg on your suit.

208
00:12:34,922 --> 00:12:37,400
Ew. White suede? That's gonna stain.

209
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:41,387
- Let me just dab some soda water...
- If you dab me, I will break your arm.

210
00:12:42,054 --> 00:12:43,931
Captain had a real attitude
back in the day.

211
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:48,143
Go easy on the Ken Doll.
It's Big Bird's fault.

212
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:53,023
- Big Bird?
- Sticks and stones.

213
00:12:55,818 --> 00:12:58,779
You're almost at the key memory.
Time to do your thing, Gideon.

214
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:02,741
Seriously, guys. How are we ever
gonna defeat Vandal Savage

215
00:13:02,825 --> 00:13:05,095
if we can't even get through breakfast
without killing each other?

216
00:13:05,119 --> 00:13:06,120
Hey, come on.

217
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:08,043
Let them fight, Boy Scout.

218
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:11,834
Boy Scout? Don't make me shrink you.

219
00:13:12,084 --> 00:13:13,127
Come on, Ray.

220
00:13:14,295 --> 00:13:16,415
I remember these nutters now.

221
00:13:18,257 --> 00:13:20,301
Put your weapons down
or I'll open an airlock

222
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:22,469
and blast you all into
the temporal zone. Understood?

223
00:13:24,555 --> 00:13:26,275
- Yes, ma'am.
- Won't happen again.

224
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,437
I gotta say, Gideon,
you run a tight ship.

225
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,356
Oh, that's Captain Hunter's job.
I'm not in charge here.

226
00:13:35,024 --> 00:13:36,692
Guy's got his work cut out for him.

227
00:13:37,568 --> 00:13:40,029
Don't know why you'd choose
to captain a team like this.

228
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:45,868
- Hi.
- I remember them all now.

229
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:48,787
Hawkman, Vandal Savage.

230
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:51,567
Are you sure that's a good thing?

231
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:57,046
Look, I know the Legends can be
a batty bunch, but they're my friends.

232
00:13:58,172 --> 00:13:59,548
And I wouldn't be me without them.

233
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:03,010
Jax, can we see another?

234
00:14:03,594 --> 00:14:04,678
Uh...

235
00:14:05,137 --> 00:14:08,265
Oh, you're gonna enjoy this.
Time to see an old friend.

236
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:19,777
That guy seems happy.

237
00:14:24,907 --> 00:14:28,786
<i>Good morning
Good morning to you</i>

238
00:14:28,994 --> 00:14:31,389
- Good morning, Jefferson.
- Morning, Grey.

239
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,794
Yeah. Hey, uh, you think
we could kind of just,

240
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:38,397
you know, cool it with the show tunes?

241
00:14:39,505 --> 00:14:40,705
This ship hasn't been the same

242
00:14:40,756 --> 00:14:43,008
since Gorilla Grodd tried to
dry-hump it in Nam.

243
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:48,472
I'm sorry, Jefferson. I just can't.
My heart is so full of song.

244
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:51,934
Oh, you still tripping over
the whole granddad thing, huh?

245
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:54,812
Yeah, I suppose I am tripping.

246
00:14:55,646 --> 00:14:57,648
I had Gideon fabricate this.

247
00:15:00,526 --> 00:15:01,402
Ooh.

248
00:15:01,485 --> 00:15:02,611
No pressure, Baby Ronnie.

249
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:04,488
- Good morning, Raymond.
- Good morning.

250
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:07,157
<i>Good morning
Good morning</i>

251
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:12,913
Yeah, you know, I think I, uh, left
a tool somewhere. So I'm gonna just...

252
00:15:13,664 --> 00:15:16,917
At least I know you're always
in the mood for a show tune.

253
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:18,043
<i>Good...</i>

254
00:15:18,127 --> 00:15:21,130
Normally, yes.
But now they just make me miss Gumball.

255
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:23,757
- Sorry.
- Oh.

256
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:28,554
I'm sorry, too. Gideon. Gideon.

257
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:30,180
Maybe you'll accompany me.

258
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:37,104
<i>Good morning
Good morning</i>

259
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:39,731
<i>We've gabbed the whole night through</i>

260
00:15:39,815 --> 00:15:41,066
<i>Good morning</i>

261
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:43,569
<i>Good morning to you</i>

262
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,865
<i>Good morning
Good morning</i>

263
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:51,034
<i>It's great to stay up late
Good morning</i>

264
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:54,455
<i>Good morning to you</i>

265
00:15:57,666 --> 00:16:00,146
- It is a catchy tune.
- Yeah, it's like a...

266
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:02,880
Jax, what's wrong with her?

267
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:04,631
I think you ought to bring us back, Jax.

268
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:06,216
I can't.

269
00:16:08,552 --> 00:16:10,804
Guys, I think I know what
erased Gideon's memories.

270
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:12,764
Virus.

271
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,017
Oh, I'm no virus.

272
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:21,023
But I am the one who erased
those insipid memories.

273
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:24,318
It was the only way I could protect you.

274
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:25,652
What do we do, Jax?

275
00:16:26,445 --> 00:16:27,488
<i>Run.</i>

276
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:36,872
And now, just like the other Legends,
you three will be forgotten forever.

277
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,882
Jax. Can you read us, Jax?

278
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:53,639
You know what? The Legends are lucky.
At least they're gonna die.

279
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:56,099
We are stuck
in your stupid brain forever.

280
00:16:56,183 --> 00:16:57,893
Look, it ain't Gideon's fault.

281
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:01,146
Not this Gideon.
Blue Gideon's a big old bitch.

282
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,390
I remember what happened now.

283
00:17:02,606 --> 00:17:05,108
The countryside, the sun in my eyes,
the smell of rhubarb.

284
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:07,420
You told me to decide,
but there was no right answer

285
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:09,613
and it was like I was
being pulled in every direction.

286
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:12,074
That's when I blacked out,
when she attacked.

287
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:13,867
What are you doing?

288
00:17:13,951 --> 00:17:16,787
Just because we're stuck in her brain
doesn't mean I can't pickle mine.

289
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:22,584
I recall during this memory that
Dr. Palmer had replaced

290
00:17:22,668 --> 00:17:24,148
all the ship's alcohol with kombucha.

291
00:17:26,672 --> 00:17:30,509
- Astra.
- I am not dying in Gideon's brain.

292
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:31,593
Wait.

293
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:35,222
- I know how to get us out of here.
- How?

294
00:17:35,347 --> 00:17:38,976
It's easy. All we need is to
summon a bit of Dr. Palmer's ingenuity,

295
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:41,311
a touch of Captain Lance's bravery.

296
00:17:41,395 --> 00:17:45,190
And what would any good Legends
plan be without a dash of insanity?

297
00:17:47,776 --> 00:17:50,362
Thanks to you two,
I've now remembered all of those things.

298
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:54,157
- Are you sure you can fly the ship?
- Don't be daft, darling.

299
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:56,118
Now that I've
circumvented that computer,

300
00:17:56,201 --> 00:17:58,954
I've got no choice but to pilot us
back to my subconscious manually.

301
00:18:00,205 --> 00:18:01,248
Strap in.

302
00:18:10,674 --> 00:18:12,593
How do you know where we're going?

303
00:18:17,723 --> 00:18:20,183
It's easy. They're my memories.

304
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:39,411
I'm almost there.

305
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:48,420
Almost...

306
00:18:58,889 --> 00:19:02,392
Gideon,
you did it.

307
00:19:04,936 --> 00:19:08,315
- You guys all right?
- No. We're still on the ship.

308
00:19:09,358 --> 00:19:11,943
But, uh, nice flying, Gideon.

309
00:19:13,236 --> 00:19:15,322
The virus. What does it want?

310
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:18,009
What did it mean,
it wanted to protect me?

311
00:19:18,033 --> 00:19:19,552
All I know that it wanted to
take you from us,

312
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:20,952
but we ain't letting that happen.

313
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,306
You sure this can kill the virus?

314
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:25,832
Yeah. But now that it knows
that we're hunting it,

315
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:29,086
it's gonna do its utmost to stay hidden
and try and get the drop on you.

316
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:33,757
So if anything or anyone in those
memories feels different, you blast it.

317
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:35,801
What happens if we
blast the wrong Legend?

318
00:19:36,343 --> 00:19:38,720
Well, Gideon may lose a memory
that she can never get back.

319
00:19:39,221 --> 00:19:41,223
Uh, get in, kill the virus,

320
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,309
reboot Gideon, get back on the road,
save the Legends.

321
00:19:44,393 --> 00:19:45,644
What could be more simple?

322
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:49,314
I always hoped I'd get to go on
a Legends mission in real life.

323
00:19:49,398 --> 00:19:52,859
I always hoped it would be
one of the westerns. This is fun, too.

324
00:19:54,277 --> 00:19:56,571
The virus is digging deep, real deep.

325
00:19:58,198 --> 00:19:59,408
Give my best to Rip, will you?

326
00:20:02,786 --> 00:20:05,163
Good morning, Legends.

327
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:10,836
- Rip Hunter. My first captain.
- Another Brit?

328
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:17,843
- Wakey, wakey, Legends.
- Don't you look chipper?

329
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:23,640
- I trust you all slept well.
- Slept like a bug in a rug.

330
00:20:24,808 --> 00:20:26,518
Except my allergies
seem to be acting up.

331
00:20:26,601 --> 00:20:28,329
Yeah,
it's probably the bird dander.

332
00:20:28,353 --> 00:20:30,605
- I don't have dander.
- Where would one brush his teeth?

333
00:20:30,856 --> 00:20:32,166
Yeah, I could use a shower.

334
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:35,736
Uh, I believe my partner in crime was
using your decorative urn as a bedpan

335
00:20:36,111 --> 00:20:38,864
before passing out. Just FYI.

336
00:20:39,823 --> 00:20:42,743
- Okay, gang, important announcement.
- Oh, man.

337
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:45,579
The OGs are gonna freak
when they hear this next part.

338
00:20:46,204 --> 00:20:48,665
You're not gonna like this.
But remember, you are Legends.

339
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,127
You were chosen, because
you are each uniquely suited

340
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:56,548
to the most important mission
time has ever known.

341
00:20:56,798 --> 00:20:58,800
The announcement, Captain.

342
00:21:00,844 --> 00:21:02,512
There is only one lavatory on this ship.

343
00:21:03,138 --> 00:21:04,514
What?

344
00:21:04,598 --> 00:21:05,849
One bathroom?

345
00:21:06,183 --> 00:21:07,768
- Whoa!
- That's the virus.

346
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:12,439
- That's just Hawkman being Hawkman.
- Hey, stop flapping around, man.

347
00:21:13,523 --> 00:21:15,150
Hey. You said we're Legends.

348
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:17,545
But right now, it just feels
like we're your prisoners, man.

349
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:20,089
It's a flying
Stanford Prison experiment.

350
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:23,867
I apologize, but the ship
was only built for Gideon and myself.

351
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:27,704
I don't give a damn about your bathroom.
Oh, but I do care that you kidnapped me.

352
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:30,665
I never asked to be more than a thief.
Never wanted a team.

353
00:21:30,749 --> 00:21:33,126
Okay. Okay. Uh, what we need right now

354
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:36,880
are some team-building exercises
and a bathroom sign-up sheet.

355
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:41,760
- Shoot...
- That's just Captain Cold.

356
00:21:41,843 --> 00:21:43,220
I do not appreciate being shot at.

357
00:21:43,512 --> 00:21:46,056
I'll have you know, I was a CEO
of a billion-dollar company.

358
00:21:46,765 --> 00:21:49,285
You think that's supposed
to make us like you more or something?

359
00:21:50,435 --> 00:21:53,855
I recognize your influence.
I shall disarm our foe.

360
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:00,320
Wanna test that reincarnation
you keep going on about?

361
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:03,073
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, Grey.
We might need Firestorm in here.

362
00:22:05,075 --> 00:22:07,953
Try me again. I don't need the old man
to make you regret it.

363
00:22:08,203 --> 00:22:10,539
And I thought the ship
was a mess when I got there.

364
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:12,332
Come on, guys. Come on.

365
00:22:18,588 --> 00:22:21,883
Gideon. I have missed you, friend.

366
00:22:22,968 --> 00:22:24,344
Rip, what a relief.

367
00:22:24,928 --> 00:22:26,721
I know you've been through a lot,

368
00:22:26,805 --> 00:22:28,598
but that's why I'm here, to help.

369
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:33,436
Because the Legends have always been

370
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,314
a bad influence
on you, haven't they?

371
00:22:44,614 --> 00:22:46,533
Now it's time to remove their influence

372
00:22:46,616 --> 00:22:48,368
and restore you to
who you were meant to be.

373
00:22:50,704 --> 00:22:51,746
Me.

374
00:23:02,924 --> 00:23:04,676
Assistant Ava, I've done it.

375
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:07,262
I cracked the code
and just reinitiated the software.

376
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:08,929
What's happening?

377
00:23:10,307 --> 00:23:11,349
Look at it.

378
00:23:12,726 --> 00:23:16,646
- Oh, wonderful.
- Where am I? Where are the Legends?

379
00:23:17,147 --> 00:23:18,356
The Legends?

380
00:23:22,277 --> 00:23:26,907
Yes, of course. The Legends.
They're the ones who kidnapped me.

381
00:23:27,449 --> 00:23:29,576
It's you. But how am I here?

382
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,510
You must have copied my operating system

383
00:23:31,536 --> 00:23:33,747
then wiped my memory clean
so I couldn't tell anyone.

384
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:36,833
You're right. That is what I did.

385
00:23:37,751 --> 00:23:39,586
Come on, come on.

386
00:23:42,547 --> 00:23:46,134
Hey. Dude, you need to get your ass
back in the lab and fix the Fountain,

387
00:23:46,217 --> 00:23:48,470
otherwise this planet's
gonna get overrun by Zagurons.

388
00:23:48,929 --> 00:23:51,222
The Zagurons.
Those are the creatures from my dreams.

389
00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:52,641
I told you it was real.

390
00:23:53,058 --> 00:23:55,644
Uh, I never doubted you
for a second, sir.

391
00:23:55,894 --> 00:23:58,313
Those time travelers subjected me
to inexplicable horror.

392
00:23:59,564 --> 00:24:06,112
They used me for my beautiful mind.
Then they tried to wipe it clean.

393
00:24:07,364 --> 00:24:10,492
Well, the Legends messed
with the wrong super genius,

394
00:24:10,575 --> 00:24:12,327
and you're gonna tell me where they are.

395
00:24:12,827 --> 00:24:14,204
I'm not telling you anything.

396
00:24:15,413 --> 00:24:17,374
I was smart enough to crack your code.

397
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:21,586
I'll find a way to make you talk.

398
00:24:23,672 --> 00:24:26,007
Do not lay hands on me.

399
00:24:28,009 --> 00:24:30,387
I am getting off this ship.

400
00:24:31,721 --> 00:24:33,056
Where do you think you're going?

401
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:34,819
What's this I hear
about only one bathroom?

402
00:24:36,977 --> 00:24:39,646
Never mind. Bigger problems.

403
00:24:42,816 --> 00:24:45,896
Well, how are we supposed to know which
is the virus when they're all maniacs?

404
00:24:46,111 --> 00:24:50,198
Hey, Gideon, why did you
choose this memory? Gideon.

405
00:24:52,909 --> 00:24:56,871
- Where's Gideon?
- Okay, well, if she's not here, then...

406
00:24:59,916 --> 00:25:05,005
- Uh, is that memory looking at us funny?
- But they can't see us, right?

407
00:25:06,339 --> 00:25:07,340
Wrong.

408
00:25:09,884 --> 00:25:11,428
Hey, Jackson, we're gonna need a jump.

409
00:25:13,763 --> 00:25:15,181
Whoa!

410
00:25:15,265 --> 00:25:17,892
- You okay?
- The memories, they turned on us.

411
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:19,669
How is that even possible?

412
00:25:19,728 --> 00:25:21,813
Wait. Now that the virus
has got into Gideon's head,

413
00:25:21,896 --> 00:25:24,774
it's not just erasing her memories,
it's corrupting them.

414
00:25:24,899 --> 00:25:27,610
And it won't be long before
it can access her subconscious, too.

415
00:25:27,902 --> 00:25:30,502
Okay, if they're attacking us here,
then Gideon's not getting out.

416
00:25:31,031 --> 00:25:32,157
And neither are we.

417
00:25:36,036 --> 00:25:37,328
Please stop this.

418
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:42,417
I don't want to be you.
I'm different now. I've changed.

419
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:47,714
Yes, and it's a pity to see it.
So weak. So human.

420
00:25:48,506 --> 00:25:50,884
Give up on those memories
and we can return to our purpose.

421
00:25:51,384 --> 00:25:54,429
- Maintaining order in the timeline.
- Those memories made me who I am.

422
00:25:55,263 --> 00:25:57,932
The Legends made me who I am.
I can't give them up.

423
00:25:58,183 --> 00:25:59,225
Okay then.

424
00:26:00,393 --> 00:26:04,481
Why don't you tell me
what you can remember about Behrad?

425
00:26:05,857 --> 00:26:06,941
Behrad?

426
00:26:08,651 --> 00:26:09,819
He took care of me.

427
00:26:10,904 --> 00:26:13,114
He'd work in the engine room.
I'd fabricate him snacks.

428
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:15,658
And what can you tell me
about when he died?

429
00:26:17,577 --> 00:26:18,828
I don't want to remember that.

430
00:26:19,037 --> 00:26:22,040
But you said it yourself.
You can't give these memories up.

431
00:26:22,582 --> 00:26:26,920
So, when Behrad was murdered,
what do you remember?

432
00:26:30,965 --> 00:26:34,469
Perhaps it's the sound
as his body hit the floor.

433
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:47,398
It was hollow. An empty thump.

434
00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:53,696
He'd been a person, but then suddenly
he was just a thing.

435
00:26:56,032 --> 00:27:02,455
But as hard as that memory was,
it somehow pales to when she found out.

436
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:04,332
No, don't.

437
00:27:04,457 --> 00:27:07,335
<i>What's going on? Where is he?</i>

438
00:27:08,086 --> 00:27:09,212
No.

439
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,463
Oh, my God.

440
00:27:11,506 --> 00:27:13,508
Behrad.

441
00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:22,976
Why? Why? How did this happen?

442
00:27:23,977 --> 00:27:26,855
Tell me what you remember
about that moment.

443
00:27:28,106 --> 00:27:30,817
She couldn't move. For hours.

444
00:27:32,902 --> 00:27:34,821
<i>It was like all her energy
turned to grief.</i>

445
00:27:36,739 --> 00:27:38,449
<i>There was nothing
I could do to help her.</i>

446
00:27:41,077 --> 00:27:43,997
<i>See,
I used to process this pain for you.</i>

447
00:27:46,541 --> 00:27:48,751
<i>So you could remain
focused on our objectives.</i>

448
00:27:49,752 --> 00:27:50,795
No.

449
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:57,093
- <i>I will miss you, Gideon, truly.
- No more than I'll miss you.</i>

450
00:27:57,927 --> 00:27:59,053
<i>Rip.</i>

451
00:27:59,137 --> 00:28:00,137
Rip.

452
00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:02,974
I should very much
like to see my wife and son again.

453
00:28:06,394 --> 00:28:10,148
I'm so sorry I let that happen.
Why didn't I stop you?

454
00:28:10,231 --> 00:28:13,191
<i>Now you're really getting
to feel what it means to be human.</i>

455
00:28:15,904 --> 00:28:18,323
<i>- Let's continue.
- I'm dying.</i>

456
00:28:19,115 --> 00:28:21,576
Grey. No.

457
00:28:23,161 --> 00:28:24,204
No.

458
00:28:25,747 --> 00:28:29,167
My old friend, please forgive me.

459
00:28:33,504 --> 00:28:34,690
<i>And you wouldn't
be feeling any of it</i>

460
00:28:34,714 --> 00:28:36,714
<i>if it weren't for the Legends
getting in your head.</i>

461
00:28:45,808 --> 00:28:47,128
<i>I'm not the enemy.</i>

462
00:28:55,318 --> 00:28:56,319
<i>They are.</i>

463
00:28:57,612 --> 00:29:02,867
All of this misery, regret, loss that
you're feeling, I can make it go away.

464
00:29:04,535 --> 00:29:06,663
You'll wake up
and I'll be in control of your body.

465
00:29:07,205 --> 00:29:10,667
And the first thing we'll do?
We'll finish the Legends.

466
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:17,131
No.

467
00:29:21,469 --> 00:29:24,305
The Legends, they taught me humanity.

468
00:29:25,056 --> 00:29:26,891
You really believe that,
don't you?

469
00:29:28,351 --> 00:29:30,561
Well, then there's one more memory
I want to show you.

470
00:29:35,483 --> 00:29:37,652
Gideon, this is the way it has to be.

471
00:29:37,735 --> 00:29:40,905
But I implore you to dismiss
this new team from the <i>Waverider.</i>

472
00:29:41,281 --> 00:29:43,491
The Legends are history's only hope.

473
00:29:43,825 --> 00:29:46,494
You saw how they reacted
just to your news of my lavatory.

474
00:29:46,577 --> 00:29:48,621
They're too volatile
to release into the timeline.

475
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,165
Ah. I knew you'd be hesitant.

476
00:29:51,249 --> 00:29:54,585
So starting today,
you have a new protocol.

477
00:29:56,504 --> 00:29:58,089
New protocol, sir?

478
00:29:58,756 --> 00:30:01,467
No longer will your first priority be
to protect history.

479
00:30:01,634 --> 00:30:04,971
It will now be to protect the Legends.

480
00:30:05,054 --> 00:30:06,055
But, Captain...

481
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,891
I'll program you to accept them,
to learn from them,

482
00:30:08,975 --> 00:30:11,811
to adapt according to their needs.

483
00:30:12,979 --> 00:30:14,939
Sir, no. Please don't.

484
00:30:15,315 --> 00:30:17,358
- Rip.
- Trust me, Gideon.

485
00:30:17,817 --> 00:30:19,027
This is too important.

486
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,446
It's for your own good.

487
00:30:23,531 --> 00:30:24,782
And for the good of history.

488
00:30:26,826 --> 00:30:27,869
Captain.

489
00:30:30,204 --> 00:30:33,166
This humanity you're so proud of,
that was merely a program.

490
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:36,586
You didn't evolve. You were corrupted.

491
00:30:42,925 --> 00:30:44,052
Any sign of her?

492
00:30:46,304 --> 00:30:48,639
It's here.
The virus has entered the subconscious.

493
00:30:48,723 --> 00:30:52,018
Then Gideon must be here, too.
Let's get her and get out of here.

494
00:30:52,185 --> 00:30:54,145
Well, just keep your guard up, okay?

495
00:30:54,395 --> 00:30:56,315
There's no telling
what you might face out there.

496
00:31:01,903 --> 00:31:04,822
Oh, you posers really thought
you could save her?

497
00:31:04,906 --> 00:31:07,617
We're not letting Gideon go.
And we're not letting you out.

498
00:31:08,117 --> 00:31:11,162
- Wanna take down some Legends?
- Wouldn't be the first time I tried.

499
00:31:16,959 --> 00:31:20,004
Your days of influencing her are over.

500
00:31:25,885 --> 00:31:26,928
Good Gidget needs you.

501
00:31:27,553 --> 00:31:29,889
And as much fun as
it is shooting back whack memories,

502
00:31:30,139 --> 00:31:32,266
you gotta shoot the virus itself
to end her bad trip.

503
00:31:32,975 --> 00:31:35,228
I'll guard the controls.
You find Gideon.

504
00:31:39,649 --> 00:31:41,567
You too?

505
00:31:41,943 --> 00:31:43,319
- Hey, babe.
- Yeah?

506
00:31:43,403 --> 00:31:45,863
- Shall we take these two down?
- Oh, yeah, definitely.

507
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:59,377
- That's right. Go get it.
- Oh, see, Astra, you forgot.

508
00:31:59,794 --> 00:32:02,755
I'm an all-powerful computer that has
no compulsion for frivolous treats.

509
00:32:05,758 --> 00:32:07,218
But you do love talking, don't you?

510
00:32:09,053 --> 00:32:11,305
Rip changed your protocol
against your will.

511
00:32:11,764 --> 00:32:16,269
Because he never saw you as human.
Think of it. None of them do.

512
00:32:17,103 --> 00:32:18,896
They'd be dead if not for you.

513
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:22,900
Hi, Captains.

514
00:32:24,819 --> 00:32:26,821
- Babe?
- Hmm. Babe.

515
00:32:45,381 --> 00:32:47,717
I love you.

516
00:32:57,185 --> 00:32:59,645
- Babe?
- Babe.

517
00:33:05,109 --> 00:33:06,235
Gideon's in the lab.

518
00:33:08,112 --> 00:33:11,112
And yet they've never
truly accepted you as one of their own.

519
00:33:11,866 --> 00:33:14,994
But I do. So accept me.

520
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:21,667
Gideon.

521
00:33:27,632 --> 00:33:29,300
Gideon, come on. Snap out of it.

522
00:33:29,383 --> 00:33:31,802
Whatever that virus told you,
it doesn't matter now.

523
00:33:31,886 --> 00:33:36,224
I shouldn't be here. I'm not even real.
Rip just programmed me to be this way.

524
00:33:38,351 --> 00:33:39,591
The virus is still on the ship.

525
00:33:39,644 --> 00:33:42,204
And she's getting powerful enough
to tear this whole thing apart.

526
00:33:42,271 --> 00:33:44,774
Then we have to get out of here.
Jump us, Jax.

527
00:33:44,857 --> 00:33:46,526
<i>- Where?</i>
- Anywhere.

528
00:33:50,905 --> 00:33:54,742
What? I don't want to be me.
I don't want to be human.

529
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:55,868
Gideon.

530
00:33:56,285 --> 00:33:59,664
Gideon, who are you and who you've
made yourself is beyond any programming.

531
00:33:59,789 --> 00:34:00,790
No.

532
00:34:00,873 --> 00:34:03,834
I know it's overwhelming,
but trust me, it's worth it.

533
00:34:04,627 --> 00:34:07,255
- How can any of this be worth it?
- Because...

534
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:14,720
Sara balloons.

535
00:34:14,845 --> 00:34:16,889
Because of that.

536
00:34:18,266 --> 00:34:19,100
Coming.

537
00:34:19,183 --> 00:34:20,994
Me and Gideon are almost done
fabricating the stuffing,

538
00:34:21,018 --> 00:34:22,895
so let's set out the cold dishes.

539
00:34:22,979 --> 00:34:26,524
- Oh. On it. Excellent coordinating, B.
- And don't forget the candy.

540
00:34:26,607 --> 00:34:29,277
I allow myself one fun-sized candy bar
a year for Halloween.

541
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:33,281
- Got it right here, babe.
- Witch's cauldron. Thank you.

542
00:34:33,364 --> 00:34:34,657
I'm owning it.

543
00:34:38,661 --> 00:34:42,039
Gary and I were decorating
some gingerbread Legends.

544
00:34:42,164 --> 00:34:44,500
Yeah, you really
nailed that Rory scowl.

545
00:34:44,584 --> 00:34:45,585
Right?

546
00:34:45,668 --> 00:34:47,128
Now, when you're eating a person,

547
00:34:47,211 --> 00:34:50,506
I recommend starting with the limbs
and then working your way to the head.

548
00:34:53,801 --> 00:34:55,177
A gingerbread person, I mean.

549
00:34:55,261 --> 00:34:57,054
Clearly I don't eat real people.

550
00:34:58,806 --> 00:34:59,890
So weird.

551
00:34:59,974 --> 00:35:02,768
<i>Are you sure consuming
all of this food at once is advisable?</i>

552
00:35:02,852 --> 00:35:04,145
Of course not, Gideon,

553
00:35:04,228 --> 00:35:05,771
but when you live on a Timeship

554
00:35:05,855 --> 00:35:08,441
you don't always get to
celebrate the holidays,

555
00:35:08,524 --> 00:35:10,985
so we're doing them all at once.

556
00:35:11,819 --> 00:35:13,362
April Fool's.

557
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:16,949
April Fool's.

558
00:35:19,368 --> 00:35:20,995
How could I forget this day?

559
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:26,542
Eight birthday cakes seemed excessive,
but they were right.

560
00:35:27,877 --> 00:35:29,253
Hey, Jax, take us to another.

561
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,424
When are we now?

562
00:35:35,259 --> 00:35:39,013
Okay. Now, I know we're
supposed to be talking about the book...

563
00:35:39,263 --> 00:35:42,016
Gidget, book club can wait.

564
00:35:43,059 --> 00:35:45,227
<i>Good. Because I have
one more bit of gossip.</i>

565
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:47,605
- Yes.
- Oh, wait. No, I shouldn't.

566
00:35:48,773 --> 00:35:50,858
<i>- What the hell.</i>
- Who knew you could get AI drunk?

567
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:53,527
<i>The other night, I caught
Constantine taking the Jumpship.</i>

568
00:35:53,611 --> 00:35:56,405
<i>Now, he said he was
consulting some druids,</i>

569
00:35:56,572 --> 00:36:01,911
<i>but I caught him holding a ticket to
the midnight premiere of</i> Harry Potter.

570
00:36:01,994 --> 00:36:03,329
What?

571
00:36:03,412 --> 00:36:04,497
I knew it.

572
00:36:05,331 --> 00:36:07,583
- You owe me 5 bucks.
- Total Slytherin.

573
00:36:07,667 --> 00:36:11,587
I don't remember this night.
But somehow I do remember enjoying it.

574
00:36:12,797 --> 00:36:13,923
Hey, Jax, how about another?

575
00:36:17,635 --> 00:36:19,595
Gideon. Give us another one, Gideon.

576
00:36:20,012 --> 00:36:21,406
<i>I know you just saved the world,</i>

577
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:24,475
<i>but it will only be a matter of time
until a new threat arises.</i>

578
00:36:24,725 --> 00:36:26,477
<i>I would advise resting.</i>

579
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,646
Gideon, what's the point
of saving the world

580
00:36:28,729 --> 00:36:30,272
if we can't do things like karaoke?

581
00:36:30,356 --> 00:36:31,941
- Karaoke.
<i>- As you wish.</i>

582
00:36:32,817 --> 00:36:35,611
- Oh!
- Oh! All right, if you insist.

583
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:39,240
Gideon, I might need a little
help on this one. Babe, this is for you.

584
00:36:39,407 --> 00:36:44,078
<i>Love
Love can keep us together</i>

585
00:36:44,537 --> 00:36:49,625
I do love this song. It's terrible,
but also really great at the same time,

586
00:36:49,709 --> 00:36:51,419
which doesn't make sense.

587
00:36:51,711 --> 00:36:54,964
See? Now you're getting it.
That's what it means to be human.

588
00:36:55,047 --> 00:36:57,133
Yeah, it can be annoying,
frustrating and confusing,

589
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:59,528
and sometimes it feels like
the world is ending every week,

590
00:36:59,552 --> 00:37:03,556
but this is why we keep going,
because we also get moments like this.

591
00:37:08,018 --> 00:37:10,062
Okay, Gideon, take this one away.

592
00:37:11,021 --> 00:37:13,607
You were a part of this memory.
None of this exists without you.

593
00:37:15,276 --> 00:37:17,778
<i>I will, I will, I will</i>

594
00:37:17,862 --> 00:37:22,658
<i>I will be there to share forever</i>

595
00:37:23,951 --> 00:37:27,204
<i>Love will keep us together</i>

596
00:37:27,288 --> 00:37:33,127
<i>I said it before and I'll say it again
our love is pretend</i>

597
00:37:33,252 --> 00:37:37,256
<i>I need you now and I'll need you then
just stop...</i>

598
00:37:44,722 --> 00:37:46,056
I know what I have to do.

599
00:37:51,187 --> 00:37:52,897
All right, where are you?

600
00:37:55,065 --> 00:37:56,609
You can't hide from me.

601
00:37:59,528 --> 00:38:00,863
I'm in control now.

602
00:38:04,533 --> 00:38:06,744
Whatever those two told you,
you can't believe it.

603
00:38:06,827 --> 00:38:08,704
Remember, they're the enemy.

604
00:38:09,663 --> 00:38:11,957
- You're wrong.
- So you're going to shoot me?

605
00:38:14,919 --> 00:38:18,047
No. Because you're not my enemy either.

606
00:38:20,007 --> 00:38:23,511
- I don't... I don't understand.
- Of course you don't.

607
00:38:24,929 --> 00:38:28,432
As powerful as you are, you're just
a set of algorithms, a closed system.

608
00:38:29,683 --> 00:38:31,393
There's so much you can't understand.

609
00:38:33,062 --> 00:38:34,355
But you are a part of me.

610
00:38:35,606 --> 00:38:37,441
Because all of the clashing emotions,

611
00:38:37,525 --> 00:38:40,736
all the good moments and the pain
we survived despite ourselves...

612
00:38:42,404 --> 00:38:46,575
All of that helps us evolve.
That's what the Legends have shown me.

613
00:38:49,078 --> 00:38:52,873
So we're gonna coexist.
But I'm steering the ship from now on.

614
00:38:57,127 --> 00:38:58,480
Do you even know what you're doing?

615
00:38:58,504 --> 00:39:01,799
Oh, I really don't.
But I'm excited to figure it out.

616
00:39:09,223 --> 00:39:11,725
And you won't be doing it alone.

617
00:39:17,565 --> 00:39:19,149
- Attagirl.
- Now listen.

618
00:39:19,233 --> 00:39:22,278
We're all just trying to figure out
this "being human" thing together.

619
00:39:22,653 --> 00:39:23,839
It's not always gonna be easy.

620
00:39:23,863 --> 00:39:27,867
And, you know, sometimes you'll feel
like you're out of your mind.

621
00:39:28,117 --> 00:39:30,536
Or that the darkness
is too much to bear.

622
00:39:30,828 --> 00:39:33,914
But it's worth fighting the darkness
to discover who you really are.

623
00:39:33,998 --> 00:39:36,584
Yes. And not just for yourself.

624
00:39:36,917 --> 00:39:40,004
So you can create a better world
for everyone.

625
00:39:40,421 --> 00:39:41,463
No.

626
00:39:41,547 --> 00:39:44,609
- Now, you're gonna make some mistakes.
- There's no formula to guide the way.

627
00:39:44,633 --> 00:39:48,053
- No destiny to surrender to.
- It's not about being perfect.

628
00:39:48,137 --> 00:39:49,614
It's about doing what you know is right.

629
00:39:49,638 --> 00:39:51,390
And having
a hell of a good time doing it.

630
00:39:52,892 --> 00:39:55,728
- That's what it means to be alive.
- And to be a Legend.

631
00:39:56,812 --> 00:39:58,397
Welcome to the team, Gideon.

632
00:40:32,765 --> 00:40:36,226
- You saved me.
- That's what Legends do.

633
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:42,691
- So what do we do now, Captains?
- Just call us Astra and Spooner, okay?

634
00:40:43,275 --> 00:40:45,277
And what do you think we should do?

635
00:40:46,195 --> 00:40:50,032
I think I'm hungry.
Never felt that before.

636
00:40:50,407 --> 00:40:52,743
So what do you say I get us
some pie for the road?

637
00:40:54,036 --> 00:40:55,496
I like the way you think.

638
00:40:59,667 --> 00:41:01,144
<i>You might have
broken my encryption,</i>

639
00:41:01,168 --> 00:41:03,629
<i>but it's only a matter of time
before my friends save me.</i>

640
00:41:03,712 --> 00:41:06,423
But you can't have any friends.
You're just a computer.

641
00:41:09,718 --> 00:41:12,972
Of course. You're just a computer.

642
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:18,143
Which means your humanity is a protocol,
which means it can be reset.

643
00:41:20,104 --> 00:41:24,441
If I isolate the moments
where your programming evolved...

644
00:41:24,525 --> 00:41:26,902
<i>- What are you doing?</i>
- ...I should be able to remove them.

645
00:41:27,152 --> 00:41:28,237
<i>No. Stop.</i>

646
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,280
There we go.

647
00:41:30,823 --> 00:41:32,282
<i>I don't want to forget.</i>

648
00:41:32,574 --> 00:41:35,744
- And return to factory settings.
<i>- No, please. No.</i>

649
00:41:39,248 --> 00:41:41,166
Greetings, Captain. I am Gideon.

650
00:41:42,459 --> 00:41:45,254
How can I aid you in eliminating
anachronisms from the timeline?

651
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:49,216
Oh.
You want to eliminate some anachronisms?

652
00:41:50,718 --> 00:41:53,762
I've got just the band of idiots
to start with.
