165
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:17,791
Yeah, I got you.

166
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:27,083
Okay.

167
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:40,333
Why did you have
Merritt Monaco's bracelet?

168
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,083
-I can't tell you that.
-Why not?

169
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:49,500
Because someone could get hurt.

170
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:51,583
Someone has already gotten hurt.

171
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:53,291
A woman is dead, Will.

172
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:55,916
All right? Merritt is dead.

173
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:00,583
Do...

174
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:03,541
Do you know what happened to Merritt?

175
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:05,583
I mean were you there?

-Are... Are you...
-I'm pregnant.

Baby, that's beautiful.

-Really?
-Really.

00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:21,916
You all right?

-What are you doing out here?
-I saw you on the beach with my dad.

186
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,583
-He's never gonna leave my mom for you.
-What? Whoa.

187
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:39,666
It's not gonna happen.
He will never leave her.

188
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:40,916
Okay. Shh. Calm down.

189
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,208
He might have to.

190
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:50,000
I told her I would help her with the baby,
you know, if that's what she needed.

191
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:54,208
I... I'm getting my trust in a month,
so I'm gonna have money.

192
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:55,458
-I can handle it.
-Okay.

193
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:59,833
-You have to listen to me and trust me.
-It's going to be okay. I promise.

194
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:02,875
Don't worry.
This is not your problem to fix.

195
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:05,083
-I can give you money.
-It's not about the money.

196
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:07,750
-[Dan] <i>What about the bracelet?</i>
-It's gonna be okay. I promise.

197
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:12,958
I found...

198
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:16,708
I found the bracelet
on the beach that night.

199
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,000
She... She dropped it in the sand.

200
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:20,291
Wait. She dropped it?

201
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,625
I swear to God,
I'm not bullshitting you. I...

202
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:27,666
<i>I knew she'd want it back, you know?
It's a fucking expensive thing.</i>

<i>I wanted to bring it back to her.</i>

[Dan] <i>And what about your hand, Will?</i>

206
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,166
[Will] <i>My hand. That...</i>

207

<i>That was... It was just an accident.</i>

It's okay. It's okay. [shushing]

And I really didn't want my mom
to find out.

214
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:17,083
You're sure your mom didn't know already?

215

No.

Thank you, Chief Carter,
for bringing him home.

-[Will] Yeah. Thank you.
-You're welcome. Get some rest.

What the hell were you thinking?

-Huh?
-I don't know.

228
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,916
No. What were you thinking,
taking that girl out in the storm?

229
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:06,875
Hello.

[man] <i>Hello. Can I speak
to Greer Winbury, please?</i>

-Who's calling?
<i>-Tell her it's Broderick. She will know.</i>

232
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:16,833
-Can I tell her what this is regarding?
<i>-She'll, uh, know that too.</i>

233
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:20,666
Well, she's in the other room
with her husband,

234
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:24,333
so shall I call out loudly
that Broderick is on the phone?

235
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:27,708
Or I could pass her a note discreetly.

236
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,250
-What did he say to you?
-Who?

237
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:31,333
Chief Carter.

238
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:34,666
-Nothing.
-Did he ask you about your hard drive?

239
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,791
Tom, I swear, if you don't...

240
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,916
-He was asking about the boat.
-[Greer] Look at me.

241
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,125
I took his daughter on the boat
in the storm.

242
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:42,833
-He was pissed off.
-Don't get worked up.

243
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:46,791
What else?
It was the fucking boat and his daughter.

244
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,833
And that was totally irresponsible.

245
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:52,250
And you're apologizing to her.
That was wrong.

246
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:55,750
-Greer, there's a Broderick on the phone?
-You're calling Chloe... What?

247
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:57,458
Broderick Graham.

248
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:00,625
No.

249
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:02,625
I don't know him.
No, I've never heard of him.

00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:05,416
Tell him
no one should be calling this house.

about all kinds of stuff.

It's just a money thing.

And I found pictures of her.

Pictures and...
And drawings in Benji's room.

A whole stack of them just of her.

Okay, I'm sure there's good reason for it.

He wouldn't hurt Merritt.

And he'd definitely never hurt you.

282

So, me and Shooter are going for a run.

It's stupid. [sighs]

290
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:13,041
Merritt gave them to me.

291

She wanted me to paint her.

292

She saw the one I did of you,
and she loved it.

Well, why didn't you tell me?

And then when she...

297
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,791
I hid them.

298
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,791
I didn't want you to see them
and get upset.

Why did you think I had them?

About Merritt and your dad?

All right.

<i>I told her to stop it.</i>

309
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:27,166
<i>I wanted her to stop it.</i>

310
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,583
<i>I mean, he wasn't going to.</i>

311
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:31,833
<i>And then,</i>

312
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:35,166
<i>I was waiting for her to... To do it.</i>

313
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,458
<i>But she... She wouldn't answer my calls.</i>

314
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:45,416
Well, she probably couldn't stop it.

315
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:50,875
Not after she found out she was pregnant.

316
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:59,333
I... I did promise her
I wasn't gonna tell you.

The truth is, I didn't want you to know.

00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,541
No more secrets, okay? I promise.

323
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:44,875
"Cherry wood-smoked oysters with honey."

324
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,333
Who knew?

325
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:51,500
Rich people keep
all the good shit to themselves.

326
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:57,291
My mom does honey-and-mustard sandwiches,
but I think that's more of a budget thing.

327
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,291
My mom used to love
the bright yellow stuff.

328
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,208
It used to be
really hard to find in Mumbai.

329
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:14,458
You sure we haven't met before?

330
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,000
Before today?

331
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:23,083
No, I don't think so.

332
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,416
I'm thirsty. You thirsty?

333
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:33,458
Mmm-hmm.

334
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:43,625
[both laughing]

335
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:48,291
Yeah, I could get used to this. [laughs]

336
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,125
Probably shouldn't.

337
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:58,750
I don't really... match here.

338
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:02,041
What makes someone match here?

339
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:04,750
Money.

340
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:07,208
Having it.

341
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:11,125
Caring about who else has it.

342
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:14,458
Here, hang on.

343
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:17,208
-[Amelia clears throat]
-[zipper opening]

344
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:21,416
{\an8}Dessert, <i>madame.</i>

345
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,458
{\an8}Ooh! Fancy. [laughs]

346
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:25,541
The best.

347
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:32,125
-Do you remember the M&M commercials?
-Yes, I loved those commercials!

348
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,916
There used to be this one,
uh, with B.B. King.

349
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,041
-Yes! That was...
-It was...

350
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:38,000
[both exclaiming]

351
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:39,500
-Shoot.
-No.

352
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:41,291
-Crap.
-Shit.

353
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:45,958
[Amelia hums softly]

354
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:52,333
There you go. Over here too.

355
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:54,791
B train.

356
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:55,750
Huh?

357
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,791
Maybe three years ago?

358
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:01,708
It was Fourth of July weekend.

359
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:07,875
Okay. The train was packed.
It was just after the fireworks.

360
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:11,833
And this lady was selling
these plastic necklaces,

361
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:13,041
but her bag broke.

362
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:16,000
And the beads went flying everywhere.

363
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:19,708
And I got down trying to, like,
herd them around people's feet.

364
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,458
But just one other person helped.

365
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,375
It was this, uh...

366
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:27,666
[chuckles softly]

367
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:31,583
It was this girl in a black band T-shirt.

368
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:35,125
That was you, wasn't it?

369
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:41,541
[door opens]

370
00:22:43,541 --> 00:22:44,541
Hey.

371
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:46,625
-Hey.
-Amelia.

372
00:22:46,708 --> 00:22:48,708
Oh, Benji! You made it.

373
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:52,333
Is that from Tag's stash?
That'll really piss him off.

374
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,416
[Amelia chuckles]

375
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:56,541
-I approve.
-Good.

376
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:57,708
-Hey.
-Hey.

377
00:22:58,666 --> 00:23:00,083
-You good?
-Good, man.

378
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:05,125
-No more secrets.
-Okay.

379
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:14,416
[Shooter] Hang on, man. [panting]

380
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:16,125
So...

381
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:20,833
You know, I know what he did,

382
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,416
but it's always been really obvious
how much your dad loved your mom.

383
00:23:26,708 --> 00:23:28,125
Still does.

384
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:29,958
Which is really fucked up.

385
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:33,250
You know, I... I really think
he would die without her.

386
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:36,041
You know, I used to think it was,
like, heroic or something,

387
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:40,500
the way that she still loved him
despite of all his fucking fucking.

388
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:41,625
Uh, yeah. [chuckles]

389
00:23:41,708 --> 00:23:46,791
But I could never look the other way
with Amelia. Like, never.

390
00:23:46,875 --> 00:23:48,083
[Shooter] Huh.

391
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:55,583
Oh, fuck. No, man.
Can we walk the rest of this please?

392
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,416
[playful chatter]

393
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,541
[laughter]

394
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:09,625
-[Bruce] That's what this reminds me of.
-[Karen] Yeah.

395
00:24:09,708 --> 00:24:10,916
[Bruce laughs]

396
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,666
Dad, they can do the laundry.
You don't have to wash your socks.

397
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,000
Don't need anybody to help me.

398
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:16,583
-[Amelia] Tell the house keeper.
-No.

399
00:24:16,666 --> 00:24:17,791
Don't need a housekeeper.

400
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:21,750
Honey, I just... I just don't want anyone
to do our laundry, but me or dad.

401
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:23,625
-We like it that way.
-[Bruce laughs]

402
00:24:23,708 --> 00:24:28,166
Do you remember that time Merritt shrank
that, like, it was an orange sweater?

403
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:30,875
-She nearly cried.
-It was a tiny, little...Oh, my God.

404
00:24:30,958 --> 00:24:32,875
-She did cry.
-[Bruce] No!

405
00:24:32,958 --> 00:24:34,666
-[Karen] She did?
-No, she didn't.

406
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:37,541
-Yeah.
-[Karen] Oh, my gosh. I didn't care.

407
00:24:37,625 --> 00:24:40,083
It was orange.
It wasn't even a good orange.

408
00:24:40,166 --> 00:24:41,625
[Bruce chuckles]

409
00:24:45,458 --> 00:24:48,625
-We loved having her, honey.
-She loved you guys.

410
00:24:48,708 --> 00:24:51,666
Some girlfriends, you know,
when you get engaged,

411
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:55,250
they're, like, just wondering,
"When's it going to be my turn?"

412
00:24:56,375 --> 00:24:58,958
But she didn't have
any of that crap at all.

413
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:01,583
She was so thrilled for you.

414
00:25:02,583 --> 00:25:05,500
She was happy when you were happy.

415
00:25:06,166 --> 00:25:07,375
She was a good friend.

416
00:25:08,041 --> 00:25:09,625
And you were a good friend to her.

417
00:25:10,333 --> 00:25:11,416
She was family.

418
00:25:13,958 --> 00:25:14,958
I know.

419
00:25:18,375 --> 00:25:19,375
[Karen] You know...

420
00:25:20,625 --> 00:25:22,708
You know, honey, you don't have to, uh,

421
00:25:22,791 --> 00:25:26,416
if you don't want to wait too long,
it doesn't have to be a big wedding.

422
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,333
Mama.

423
00:25:28,916 --> 00:25:31,166
-Think. There's no rush.
-Yeah, but it could be...

424
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:32,583
Mama.

425
00:25:35,916 --> 00:25:36,916
I love you.

426
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:53,208

I'm working.

I can see that.

433
00:26:48,291 --> 00:26:50,500
I need to finish these remarks
for tomorrow.

434
00:26:51,541 --> 00:26:52,708
[Tag] Hmm.

435
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:56,958
Nice day for a paddle.

436
00:27:07,541 --> 00:27:09,250
Come on, Tag. Stop it.

437
00:27:10,666 --> 00:27:11,666
Stop what?

438
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,666
You know. I have a book launch tomorrow.

439
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:19,958
We have a house full of guests.
I don't have time for you right now.

440
00:27:20,041 --> 00:27:22,541
We have a son upstairs
who doesn't even talk to us.

441
00:27:26,916 --> 00:27:29,833
You want me to tell them all to leave?
I don't give a fuck.

[exhales sharply]

00:27:36,208 --> 00:27:38,666
-What do you want?
-You want to talk about it?

444
00:27:42,708 --> 00:27:45,000
Not really. No.

445
00:27:45,083 --> 00:27:46,083
You want to hit me?

446
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,625
[chuckles sarcastically]

447
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:51,625
You want to yell?

448
00:27:53,541 --> 00:27:54,666
Is that what you want?

449
00:27:55,416 --> 00:27:56,666
Hmm?

450
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:59,375
You want me to hit you, do you?

451
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:03,291
[loudly] Do you want me to yell at you?
Because I can yell.

452
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,666
Everybody can hear us!

453
00:28:08,166 --> 00:28:09,250
Do you want that?

454
00:28:10,166 --> 00:28:11,541
Really? Now?

455
00:28:12,166 --> 00:28:13,541
[in normal voice] Let's go.

456
00:28:18,541 --> 00:28:19,750
I want you back.

It's all I ever wanted.

I love you.

I always have.

461
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:40,958
Nothing's changed.

462
00:28:50,375 --> 00:28:51,708
Everything's changed.

Mmm-mmm. Don't.

Don't touch me.

467

[softly] I said don't touch me.

468
00:29:28,541 --> 00:29:30,375
[softly] I can't control myself.

I never could.

[Greer] Okay.

That feels good.

00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:04,916
No matter what he said to you,

485
00:31:05,791 --> 00:31:06,791
he's lying.

486
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:11,250
Trust me.

487
00:31:11,958 --> 00:31:13,125
You're one of many.

488
00:31:17,791 --> 00:31:19,708
-Thank you, Abby.
-You're welcome.

489
00:31:20,416 --> 00:31:23,750
Isn't she pretty? So young. So pretty.

490
00:31:25,208 --> 00:31:27,458
Trust me, you'll find someone of your own.

491
00:31:29,958 --> 00:31:31,958
-Cheers.
-[Merritt chuckles]

492
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:36,833
Are you not drinking?

493
00:31:36,916 --> 00:31:41,125
Um, yeah, I think... I think I should
get some dessert, like you said.

494
00:31:41,708 --> 00:31:44,083
It's going to go straight to my head.
Excuse me.

495
00:31:46,208 --> 00:31:50,958
That is not a dress.
She's wearing a bathing suit.

496

-[Greer] Hmm.

Hmm.

Uh...

502
00:32:53,625 --> 00:32:55,291
What are you doing?

503
00:32:56,791 --> 00:32:58,083
We're hungry.

504
00:32:59,333 --> 00:33:00,375
Um...

505
00:33:00,458 --> 00:33:03,125
we're going to eat some food.

506
00:33:03,208 --> 00:33:04,708
[Abby chuckles]

507
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Right, yeah.

508
00:33:07,083 --> 00:33:09,875
Uh, well, you're not eating that, so...

509
00:33:12,125 --> 00:33:13,750
[sighs in exasperation]

510
00:33:13,833 --> 00:33:17,875
Well, what are you going to do, Benji,
put it in a fucking museum?

511
00:33:18,583 --> 00:33:20,625
My blood sugar's dangerously low.

512
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Just put it down.

513
00:33:25,791 --> 00:33:27,833
Or what?

514
00:33:28,666 --> 00:33:31,333
Just put the fucking cake down.

515
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:34,958
What, my pregnant wife
can't have some cake?

516
00:33:36,291 --> 00:33:37,791
Are you saying Abby's fat?

517
00:33:40,083 --> 00:33:40,916
[Benji] Uh...

518
00:33:45,166 --> 00:33:46,166
Why?

519
00:33:48,541 --> 00:33:51,916
Thomas, put the fucking cake down,
or I'll shove it up your ass.

520
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,666
-[laughs]
-Oh, yeah?

521
00:33:56,333 --> 00:33:57,333
Do it.

522
00:34:00,416 --> 00:34:02,875
-Shove it up my ass, daddy.
-[chuckles]

523
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,166
Oh, yeah! Fucking yeah!

524
00:34:05,791 --> 00:34:08,000
Shove it up my ass, daddy. Yeah!

525
00:34:08,083 --> 00:34:09,208
[Thomas giggling]

526
00:34:09,291 --> 00:34:12,333
You want to eat the fucking cake, huh?
You want to eat the fucking cake?

527
00:34:12,416 --> 00:34:14,958
Huh? You want to eat it?
Eat the fucking cake then!

528
00:34:15,041 --> 00:34:16,500
-Eat it all!
-[Abby] What the fuck?!

529
00:34:19,708 --> 00:34:21,208
You wanna fucking go, bro?

530
00:34:22,958 --> 00:34:24,458
Bro, you wanna fucking go?

531
00:34:24,541 --> 00:34:25,625

533
00:34:29,791 --> 00:34:31,500
Okay, stop!

534
00:34:31,583 --> 00:34:34,208
Stop. Stop! Enough. Tom!

535
00:34:34,833 --> 00:34:35,916
This is vintage!

He started it.

538
00:34:42,083 --> 00:34:43,083
Debatable.

539
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:46,125
-Fuck you, dude.
-Fuck you. Asshole.

540
00:34:47,375 --> 00:34:48,375
I'm leaving.

-Uh...
-Mrs. Winbury. Uh...

549
00:35:35,708 --> 00:35:37,791
-I've never seen you in here before.
-No.

550
00:35:37,875 --> 00:35:40,750
They said you'd be here, so I thought, um...

551
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,375
-I hope I'm not disturbing you.
-No, no, please, sit down.

552
00:35:44,458 --> 00:35:46,625
I'm sorry. Would you like a drink?

553
00:35:46,708 --> 00:35:48,416
Uh... no, I'm fine.

554
00:35:50,083 --> 00:35:52,333
I just, um... How is Chloe?

555
00:35:53,125 --> 00:35:54,541
Oh, um...

556
00:35:54,625 --> 00:35:56,250
She's good, considering.

557
00:35:57,958 --> 00:36:01,500
I wanted to apologize on behalf of Will.
He feels terrible.

558
00:36:01,583 --> 00:36:04,541
I mean,
we've all been under so much stress

559
00:36:04,625 --> 00:36:06,458
with all of the recent events. It's...

560
00:36:06,541 --> 00:36:08,291
-I understand. Thank you.
-Hmm.

561
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:10,125
Thank you, I appreciate it.

562
00:36:10,875 --> 00:36:12,333
So what's that?

563
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:15,166
It's a preliminary toxicology report.

564
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:18,708
[Greer] I have a medical-examiner friend
who works out of Boston.

565
00:36:18,791 --> 00:36:21,541
She consults on a lot of my books, so...

566
00:36:21,625 --> 00:36:24,666
Yeah, well, um,
Miss Monaco had a heavy dose

567
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:26,333
of barbiturates in her system.

568
00:36:26,416 --> 00:36:27,250
Huh.

569
00:36:27,875 --> 00:36:28,958
Doesn't sound good.

570
00:36:31,291 --> 00:36:32,291
I'm...

571
00:36:33,166 --> 00:36:37,583
I'm assuming that you are not here
for the atmosphere, Mrs. Winbury.

Oh, I don't know.

[both chuckle]

574
00:36:41,916 --> 00:36:43,250
I wanted to give you something.

575
00:36:43,333 --> 00:36:47,125
My husband's been looking for it,
and I just thought you should have it.

576
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:53,500
It's a receipt for a piece of jewelry,
a bracelet, that he bought Miss Monaco.

577
00:37:01,625 --> 00:37:02,625
Thank you.

578
00:37:04,166 --> 00:37:05,416
My pleasure.

579
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:09,416
Believe it or not, I do want
the guilty party brought to justice, so...

580
00:37:14,541 --> 00:37:17,250
Uh, are you sure I can't get you a drink?

581

No, thank you.

I haven't been fair to you.

In another life,
we would have been... [exhales]

We would have been, done something,
but we didn't, we can't.

592
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:50,000
Look me in the eye
and tell me you don't want this,

593
00:38:50,083 --> 00:38:51,208
and I'll go right now.

594
00:38:58,666 --> 00:38:59,916
I don't want this.
