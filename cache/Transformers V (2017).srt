1
00:01:34,209 --> 00:01:36,464
Where in hell is your so-called magician?

2
00:01:36,489 --> 00:01:38,074
He will be here Lancelot.

3
00:01:38,294 --> 00:01:39,458
He swore it.

4
00:01:45,632 --> 00:01:47,213
They are preparing for a second wave.

5
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,359
Charge!

6
00:02:07,378 --> 00:02:09,839
This... This is what the end looks like.

7
00:02:32,654 --> 00:02:35,615
Your so-called magician, Merlin,
cannot help us.

8
00:02:35,782 --> 00:02:37,739
We are outnumbered, 100 to 1.

9
00:02:37,764 --> 00:02:39,091
How are we gonna get out of this?

10
00:02:39,116 --> 00:02:40,560
He promised a weapon,
one of great power.

11
00:02:40,585 --> 00:02:41,836
Arthur, you are my king.

12
00:02:41,913 --> 00:02:44,569
I will lay down my life for you,
but this Merlin...

13
00:02:44,866 --> 00:02:45,983
is no wizard.

14
00:02:46,008 --> 00:02:47,885
He is a worthless drunkard!

15
00:02:50,755 --> 00:02:52,223
God, I am sozzled!

16
00:02:53,718 --> 00:02:55,012
One last nip.

17
00:03:09,107 --> 00:03:11,503
<font color=#f4ff7a><i>Magic does exist.</i></font>

22
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:24,282
Hello?

23
00:03:25,581 --> 00:03:27,083
Hello!

24
00:03:27,644 --> 00:03:28,645
It is I,

25
00:03:29,085 --> 00:03:30,615
conjurer of spirits,

26
00:03:31,564 --> 00:03:33,694
master of the dark arts!

27
00:03:34,632 --> 00:03:36,061
Is anyone there?

28
00:03:37,844 --> 00:03:39,444
It is I, Merlin.

29
00:03:40,972 --> 00:03:41,973
The wizard?

30
00:03:42,682 --> 00:03:43,808
Remember me?

31
00:03:49,814 --> 00:03:51,845
No! I kept your secret! I did!

32
00:03:51,869 --> 00:03:53,103
Just as I promised!

33
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:55,923
I told no one of your existence.
No one!

34
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,892
But you have to understand,

35
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,274
we Britons...

36
00:03:59,991 --> 00:04:01,493
are in a desperate fight.

37
00:04:01,993 --> 00:04:03,273
End of times sort of thing.

38
00:04:03,351 --> 00:04:04,216
I mean it.

39
00:04:04,241 --> 00:04:06,313
It's happening down there now as we speak.

40
00:04:06,414 --> 00:04:07,915
It's awful!

41
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:11,819
Big personalities just sort of clashing
and bloody.

42
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:15,201
I hate to ask...

43
00:04:15,953 --> 00:04:17,133
But we need your help.

44
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,469
There are no spells.
There is no magic.

45
00:04:19,594 --> 00:04:21,738
We retreat.
Live to fight another day.

46
00:04:21,763 --> 00:04:22,430
No!

47
00:04:22,597 --> 00:04:24,169
Without sacrifice...

48
00:04:24,443 --> 00:04:26,005
There can be no victory.

49
00:04:26,784 --> 00:04:28,244
This is madness!

50
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:29,378
He will be here.

51
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,853
Alright, I am what they say!

52
00:04:32,106 --> 00:04:34,137
I am a liar, I am a charlatan.

53
00:04:34,286 --> 00:04:35,902
I have deceived my whole life.

54
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:37,098
But if I could,

55
00:04:37,122 --> 00:04:38,266
for one moment,

56
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,102
change this world for the better,

57
00:04:40,448 --> 00:04:41,769
I would give up everything.

58
00:04:41,793 --> 00:04:42,781
Everything!

59
00:04:42,942 --> 00:04:45,612
I would give up drink, money, worn...

60
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,262
Drink and money.

61
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:48,848
Look.

62
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,293
Good men will die, without your help.

63
00:04:52,627 --> 00:04:54,162
Women. Children.

64
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,534
I know your world was destroyed.

65
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:58,256
I am sorry.

66
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:01,194
But please don't let ours die too.

67
00:05:03,721 --> 00:05:04,839
I beg of you.

68
00:05:05,515 --> 00:05:08,296
Guardian Knights, transform.

69
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,771
Dragon is yours to command.

70
00:05:13,314 --> 00:05:14,431
Yes.

71
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:17,235
That would be just the thing.

72
00:05:20,696 --> 00:05:22,360
Protect this staff.

73
00:05:22,907 --> 00:05:26,211
One day a great evil will come for it.

74
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:54,963
Oh, yes!

75
00:06:05,825 --> 00:06:06,826
Charge!

No, he is busy.
He is always busy.

104
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:46,871
A Mojito...

105
00:07:47,392 --> 00:07:48,455
needs ice.

106
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:50,291
Ice!

107

I like this.

114

Good choice. Good choice.

115
00:08:09,275 --> 00:08:10,962
This is... Get it off my desk.

116
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,243
No way!

117
00:08:13,731 --> 00:08:14,908
Where did you get that?

Go, go, go, go!

121
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,613
<font color=#f4ff7a><i>And they choose earth.</i></font>

<font color=#f4ff7a><i>Why?</i></font>

123
00:08:31,795 --> 00:08:33,537
You all want to see some dead robots?

124
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,308
You crazy?

125
00:08:37,404 --> 00:08:39,349
This is an alien no-go zone.

126
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,071
Government doesn't want us
to go in here.

127
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:56,578
We are not supposed to be here.

128
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,107
We are kids man.
We get away with anything.

129
00:08:59,667 --> 00:09:00,834
No man.

130
00:09:02,411 --> 00:09:03,739
I am getting me a souvenir.

131
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:10,676
This is the real deal.

132
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,635
There is a dead one over there.

133
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,862
Cool!
Not cool.

134
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:14,925
TRF shot them down.

135
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,419
Whatever.

136
00:09:16,443 --> 00:09:18,941
My dad says shoot them all
and let god sort them out.

Dude.

00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,315
It's a robot!

140
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,341
Dude, I think it's dead.

141
00:09:26,381 --> 00:09:27,667
No bro.
No is dead.

142
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:28,720
Yeah, it's totally dead.

143
00:09:28,745 --> 00:09:30,807
It's crazy.
He is definitely, definitely dead.

144
00:09:30,834 --> 00:09:32,396
I know, right?
Wait, guys.

145
00:09:32,932 --> 00:09:34,279

156
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,277

Damn.

161
00:11:16,689 --> 00:11:18,048
I almost had a heart attack!

162
00:11:18,073 --> 00:11:18,791
Relax.

163
00:11:19,182 --> 00:11:20,108
We are covered.

164
00:11:20,565 --> 00:11:21,596
Sqweeks!

165
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,140
What's that?

166
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,612
What the...

167
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,752
What happened to your arm?

168
00:11:27,573 --> 00:11:28,861
Shot you?

169
00:11:29,387 --> 00:11:30,388
Damn it!

170
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:33,205
He can't transform.

171
00:11:33,857 --> 00:11:34,983
I am trying to fix him.

172
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:36,955
But you are being a baby about it Sqweeks.

173
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,783
It's alright. You did good.

174
00:11:41,914 --> 00:11:43,374
You have a big heart...

175
00:11:44,552 --> 00:11:45,845
That seems to be working.

176
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,483
What's your workout routine?

177
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,600
It's alright. It's alright. I told you.

178
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:07,089
Covered.

179
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:08,573
It's Canopy.

180
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:13,900
Cyclops, zoom in on target.

181
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:17,362
<i>Unable PID.
Visual on five little feathers.</i>

182
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:18,821
Kids. Shit.

183
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,032
<i>Cannot confirm decepticon.</i>

184
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,784
No badge. I got kids in danger.

185
00:12:23,467 --> 00:12:25,386
Canopy thing is pretty crazy.
It's none of your business.

186
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:26,355
Stop flirting.

187
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:29,091
Request immediate air support.
Danger close. Do not fire.

188
00:12:31,267 --> 00:12:33,102
Who is he?
Let's go.

189
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,837
Far as you are concerned, my boyfriend.

190
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:37,597
How long is that been going on?

191
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,032
You kids got to get out of here.

192
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:44,722
Kids? You are here.

193
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,928
I live here.

194
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:47,501
This is my home.

195
00:12:47,748 --> 00:12:48,673
What's this?

196
00:12:48,697 --> 00:12:50,293
The living room or the dining room?

197
00:12:50,318 --> 00:12:51,862
Someone is got to take care of them.

198
00:12:51,887 --> 00:12:52,989
I don't think so.

199
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:55,056
They are scared. They are lost.

200
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,888
Hurry.

201
00:12:55,913 --> 00:12:58,239
<i>I have got a heat signature.
Hostile intent is displayed.</i>

202
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,487
Tango is armed.

203
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:01,646
<i>On location 30 seconds.
Am I cleared to fire?</i>

204
00:13:01,671 --> 00:13:04,169
No place, no home, no family.
Do you know how that feels?

205
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,771
No, because your asses got
big old houses to go home to.

206
00:13:06,796 --> 00:13:08,107
We got a condo.

207
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,163
I love her.

208
00:13:10,198 --> 00:13:11,452
<i>Viper flight. We need a clearance.</i>

209
00:13:11,488 --> 00:13:13,795
No badge, armed and hostile.
I got kids in danger.

210
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,061
<i>Hostile intent. Hostile intent.</i>

211
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:16,587
<i>Alien has</i> a <i>weapon.
Fire!</i>

212
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:33,774
He is down.
Bravo team, extract those kids.

213
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:34,842
We are moving out!

214
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:40,488
Get up.
I can't.

215
00:13:40,668 --> 00:13:42,253
No, no, no, look at me.

216
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:45,113
Wake up Canopy!
You are gonna be ok.

217
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:53,292
I want to thank you.

218
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:54,989
Wake up, look at me.

219
00:13:55,013 --> 00:13:57,249
Wake up Canopy.
I am not leaving you.

220
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,005
You are all I have left!

221
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:02,633
No, no, no, no.

222
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,600
Hey! It's all I got in my bag of tricks,
so you might want to hop in.

223
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:23,446
Hey! Where are the keys?

224
00:14:23,471 --> 00:14:24,792
Where are the keys?

225
00:14:24,817 --> 00:14:26,175
I am just gonna hot wire this bitch.

226
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,583
I am tired of people messing with me.

227
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:41,939
It's over.

228
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,643
No! I can fix him.

229
00:14:43,928 --> 00:14:45,362
Nobody can fix him, he is dead.

230
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:47,495
Hey, look at me.
Would he want you to die, too?

231
00:14:47,913 --> 00:14:49,331
Let's go, now.

232
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,478
Come on, come on, come on!

233
00:14:59,061 --> 00:15:01,186
Come on. Come on, no time, let's go.

234
00:15:01,239 --> 00:15:03,224
What? Hey, hey, you are that guy.

235
00:15:03,248 --> 00:15:04,316
No, I am not that guy.

236
00:15:04,341 --> 00:15:05,559
The one who saves Transformers.

237
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:06,855
I thought you were just a legend.

238
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,881
Some legend.

239
00:15:07,906 --> 00:15:09,070
You were too late!

240
00:15:09,187 --> 00:15:11,085
Hey, you know there is a reward
for turning you in.

241
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,120
Really?
Yeah.

242
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:14,163
Cool. You want to get punched
in the face, like really hard?

243
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,082
No.

244
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,721
Good. Go.
Ok.

245
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,168
You are such an idiot.

246
00:15:19,193 --> 00:15:20,282
See ya around,

247
00:15:20,877 --> 00:15:21,938
legend.

248
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:22,964
Sqweeks.

249
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:39,771
Easy. Easy, alright?

250
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:42,048
I am just here to help you.

251
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,698
Easy buddy. Yeah.

252
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,880
You are hurt really bad. Alright.

253
00:15:56,786 --> 00:15:59,581
Protect from quin...

254
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:02,462
I am sorry.

255
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:05,578
Take...

256
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:07,620
the...

257
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:11,846
The talisman will protect you.

258
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:13,164
You don't owe me anything.

259
00:16:15,326 --> 00:16:16,172
I can't.

260
00:16:16,497 --> 00:16:17,512
You keep it.

261
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:19,458
Quin... quin...

262
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:25,055
He didn't make it Bee.

263
00:16:25,274 --> 00:16:26,722
I am coming out solo.

264
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:30,469
This is turning into one shitty-ass day.

265
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,990
<i>Cyclops, Eyeball, Kingfish.
Flip ir to eo.</i>

266
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:12,131
He is a positive match sir.
It's Cade Yeager.

267
00:17:14,036 --> 00:17:14,855
It's over.

268
00:17:15,472 --> 00:17:16,864
Help yourself out here.

269
00:17:18,754 --> 00:17:19,727
Where are the others?

270
00:17:20,031 --> 00:17:21,231
The ones you are hiding.

271
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,670
I don't sell out friends.

272
00:17:23,695 --> 00:17:24,608
Friends?

273
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:26,764
This is an invasion.

274
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,285
One day we wake up.

275
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,616
They are in charge.

276
00:17:30,405 --> 00:17:31,783
You see anybody in charge?

277
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,439
They just keep falling out of the sky.

278
00:17:35,332 --> 00:17:37,494
Something is coming
and you can't shoot your way out of it.

279
00:18:04,371 --> 00:18:05,423
What was that?

280
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,295
That was a mistake.

281
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,497
Watch out, watch out, watch out!

282
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:52,827
Next time you shoot somebody,

283
00:18:52,852 --> 00:18:55,313
don't go near them
till you are sure they are dead.

284
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,301
Put the weapon down, trust me!

285
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,138
Easy, Bee. Easy.

286
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:04,376
I will burn you so bad
you will wish you would died as a child.

287
00:19:04,588 --> 00:19:05,575
Shoot him!

288
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:07,208
You are dead before I hit the ground.

289
00:19:07,233 --> 00:19:09,795
I said stand down.
Shoot! Shoot!

290
00:19:11,229 --> 00:19:12,924
Take the shot!
Shoot!

291
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,403
Don't do it Bee!

292
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:17,281
Hold your fire! Hold it!

293
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:18,991
You! Drop it!

294
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,679
I am not dropping shit.

295
00:19:21,997 --> 00:19:22,715
Hey.

296
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:26,515
The military doesn't want it this way
Bee, you got to believe that.

297
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,585
It's a new world order now
and these guys are calling the shots.

298
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:31,587
All they want is a home and you know it.

299
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:33,588
You push them and they push right back.

300
00:19:35,351 --> 00:19:37,072
Hound is in town.

301
00:19:37,244 --> 00:19:39,463
Love starting the day off with a gunfight.

302
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:42,431
Sorry I am late.
My invitation to this ass-kicking

303
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:44,297
must have got lost in the mail!

304
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,781
Me and my crew are rolling out of here.

305
00:19:46,896 --> 00:19:48,981
Call off your birds.
Let's go.

306
00:19:49,109 --> 00:19:50,569
They are not gonna touch us.

307
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,251
Alright, Star1 abort.
Negative decepticon activity.

308
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:56,927
TRF stand fast. Drop your guns.

309
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:58,852
You sure you don't want to shoot?

310
00:19:58,876 --> 00:20:00,252
I am a big ol' target.

311
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:01,867
Wusses.

312
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:04,453
Whose side are you on?

313
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,193
They are all bad.
No,

314
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,502
they are not.

315
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,174
Eagle Eye, tag him.

316
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:17,133
I have never seen one like it, general.

317
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:20,778
This one is older,
older than Optimus Prime.

318
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:24,640
Decepticon barricade was spotted
at that same location.

319
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:32,314
CIA's had him under pred surveillance
for a while now.

320
00:20:39,662 --> 00:20:41,982
Yeah, he I been keeping
some interesting company.

321
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:44,994
<i>The staff is hidden on earth.</i>

322
00:20:45,155 --> 00:20:47,491
<i>A weapon of ultimate power.</i>

323
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:49,957
<i>We will find this staff.</i>

324
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,459
That voice.

325
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,586
I can hear it in my nightmares.

326
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:54,616
Megatron.

327
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,338
Waiting for authentication.
It's him.

328
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,090
Lord Megatron.

329
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:00,856
Get that out of my face.

330
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:02,622
Report.

331
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:05,473
Tell me you have found the talisman.

332
00:21:05,498 --> 00:21:06,721
I saw it.

333
00:21:06,745 --> 00:21:08,866
A dying knight gave it to a human.

334
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:11,353
But there was too much TRF firepower.

335
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:14,241
You let the talisman get away!

336
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,437
We must have it!

337
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:19,558
Without the talisman,

338
00:21:19,582 --> 00:21:21,300
we cannot find the staff!

339
00:21:21,355 --> 00:21:23,115
I know who can lead us to it.

340
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:25,868
The TRF.

341
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,554
Commander in Chief wants that weapon,

342
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:32,426
or staff as he calls it, secured at all cost.

343
00:21:32,695 --> 00:21:35,323
Maintain your covert embed with TRF.

344
00:21:35,348 --> 00:21:36,188
Sir...

345
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:37,559
they just don't get it.

346
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:40,591
Our history with Bee and the Autobots.

347
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:45,267
What we would all give
to have Prime back right now.

348
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:48,197
<i>Optimus Prime.</i>

349
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:51,663
<i>Re-entry Cybertron.</i>

350
00:22:14,286 --> 00:22:16,121
My world!

351
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:20,072
What has happened to my world?

352
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:22,468
Your world is dying.

353
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:27,804
I have been waiting for you, Optimus.

354
00:22:28,268 --> 00:22:30,103
Come meet your Maker.

355
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:34,325
You are my creator?

356
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:35,842
I am Quintessa,

357
00:22:36,311 --> 00:22:38,137
the Prime of life.

358
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:43,362
What have you done to my home?

359
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,338
I will kill you!

360
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:55,030
You dare to strike your god?

361
00:22:57,516 --> 00:22:59,921
Your war doomed Cybertron.

362
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:03,445
Megatron started the war!

363
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:08,178
You destroyed your world, you fool.

364
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,685
My perfect creation.

365
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,477
You are going to fix it,

366
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:19,398
or the race of Transformers dies forever.

367
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:23,737
I made you.

368
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:26,375
You are mine to command.

369
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:38,896
How did you get in here?

370
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:53,340
My lord, that weird thing

371
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:55,939
we have been waiting
for 1,600 years to happen...

372
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:58,854
I think it's really happening this time!

373
00:24:07,381 --> 00:24:08,880
The knight has arrived.

374
00:24:09,708 --> 00:24:12,299
The talisman has been bestowed.

375
00:24:14,912 --> 00:24:16,401
At last Cogman.

376
00:24:16,848 --> 00:24:17,997
It begins.

377
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:41,022
Mine!

378
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,282
Yes!

379
00:24:54,332 --> 00:24:55,107
Ok.

380
00:24:55,498 --> 00:24:56,348
Thanks.

381
00:24:59,039 --> 00:24:59,903
Wembly!

382
00:25:00,364 --> 00:25:01,668
I was quite open.

383
00:25:01,725 --> 00:25:03,582
There is a reason why you are always open.

384
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,176
There is a reason you are always single.

385
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:06,778
What?
What?

386
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:09,466
Idiot.

387
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:28,162
On, god. Ok.

388
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,612
So late, so late, so late.

389
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:33,687
484 CE.

390
00:25:33,979 --> 00:25:37,573
A desperate last stand
between civilization and barbarism.

391
00:25:38,596 --> 00:25:40,144
Two worlds colliding.

392
00:25:40,242 --> 00:25:41,994
Only one survives.

393
00:25:42,395 --> 00:25:44,376
Lancelot. Percival.

394
00:25:44,401 --> 00:25:45,569
King Arthur.

395
00:25:45,801 --> 00:25:47,178
Honorable men.

396
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:48,452
Brave,

397
00:25:48,534 --> 00:25:50,315
muscles sinewed,

398
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,928
sweat glistening off their bodies.

399
00:25:52,953 --> 00:25:56,764
A few brave men who were willing
to sacrifice all for victory.

400
00:25:57,139 --> 00:25:58,944
Sound too good to be true, poppy?

401
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,006
Because it's horseshit.

402
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:03,373
Arthur.

403
00:26:03,653 --> 00:26:07,491
A likely composite of a Roman general
and a Celtic king.

404
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,379
Our dragon.

405
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:11,738
Just a medieval catapult.

406
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:13,560
And then we have,

407
00:26:13,811 --> 00:26:15,976
Merlin, our kingmaker.

408
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:18,368
Probably never existed.

409
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:20,647
The question is...

410
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:22,235
why?

411
00:26:22,437 --> 00:26:24,707
Why do we tell ourselves these stories?

412
00:26:24,898 --> 00:26:27,106
Other than the fact
that dragons are wicked.

413
00:26:28,462 --> 00:26:30,762
It's because we want to believe.

414
00:26:31,392 --> 00:26:34,228
Believe that we can be heroes
in our own lives.

415
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:36,695
When all seems lost,

416
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,972
a few brave souls, us,

417
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:41,225
can save everything we have ever known.

418
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,439
Or is it just the dragons?

419
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,105
Well,

420
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:03,121
it won't be much longer now, old friend.

421
00:27:03,934 --> 00:27:06,270
Signs of the end are all around us.

422
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:09,112
You know what to do, don't you?

423
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:14,424
We must rebuild my home.

424
00:27:14,956 --> 00:27:18,359
There is a way to heal your world.

425
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:21,086
My power of creation,

426
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,432
the staff,

427
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:24,464
was stolen from me,

428
00:27:24,699 --> 00:27:27,229
by my 12 guardian knights.

429
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:29,177
They betrayed me...

430
00:27:29,201 --> 00:27:30,886
and hid it on earth.

431
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:33,986
Gave it to your precious humans.

432
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:39,002
The staff is the only way
to bring life back to Cybertron.

433
00:27:39,367 --> 00:27:42,158
You are going to find it for me.

434
00:27:42,999 --> 00:27:45,616
Do you seek redemption Prime?

435
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:48,030
Do you?

436
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,419
My Maker,

437
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,588
I do.

438
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:55,969
No fear.

439
00:27:56,165 --> 00:27:57,497
No hate.

440
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:59,457
No anger.

441
00:28:00,652 --> 00:28:02,419
No fear.

442
00:28:02,786 --> 00:28:03,962
No hate.

443
00:28:03,986 --> 00:28:05,458
No anger.

444
00:28:05,976 --> 00:28:07,726
Get off you maggot!

445
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,897
I will kill you, flying rat!

446
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:16,433
He is very little.

447
00:28:16,457 --> 00:28:17,529
Very tiring.

448
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:19,865
Losing our heads sitting around here.

449
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,808
So tired of hiding.

450
00:28:32,217 --> 00:28:33,450
Hey, Chief!

451
00:28:33,609 --> 00:28:34,577
Nice...

452
00:28:35,211 --> 00:28:36,116
God!

453
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:38,085
Nice horse you got there.

454
00:28:38,177 --> 00:28:40,007
You are really getting into
this whole Indian thing?

455
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:42,417
Don't call me Chief.

456
00:28:42,441 --> 00:28:43,584
My name is Sherman.

457
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:45,724
Aren't you the tribal Chief?

458
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:46,588
Yeah.

459
00:28:46,612 --> 00:28:48,146
But from you it sounds...

460
00:28:48,283 --> 00:28:49,990
I don't know, vaguely racist.

461
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:53,190
My cruiser got stolen.
What?

462
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,525
Again.
That's terrible!

463
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:56,652
You know what?

464
00:28:56,677 --> 00:28:58,020
Shit is getting out of control.

465
00:28:58,045 --> 00:28:59,588
There is crime going on everywhere!

466
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:00,948
A bunch of my stuff got stolen.

467
00:29:00,973 --> 00:29:02,187
Cut the shit, Cade...

468
00:29:02,211 --> 00:29:03,642
and get me my car back.

469
00:29:14,194 --> 00:29:16,108
Is this an Autobot hookup site?

470
00:29:16,251 --> 00:29:17,866
No, I just go here to dream.

471
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:19,883
Check out that classy chassis.

472
00:29:20,983 --> 00:29:22,522
Look at the junk in her trunk.

473
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:26,265
Booyah! Big time.

474
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:29,309
I should not have eaten
all of that Tijuana street machinery.

475
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:31,645
Damn, forgot about that cluster bomb.

476
00:29:32,205 --> 00:29:32,996
Yo!

477
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:34,544
What's your problem, dude?

478
00:29:34,648 --> 00:29:35,607
Sqweeks!

479
00:29:35,632 --> 00:29:38,468
Next time, ease on the brakes!

480
00:29:38,493 --> 00:29:41,746
That's the way I roll.
I like to make a statement when I arrive.

481
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:44,132
Well, you are getting dust
all over the campus!

482
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:45,805
This ain't no campus. It's a junkyard!

483
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:47,586
Come on, hustle. Andale, andale!

484
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:51,266
Jimmy!

485
00:29:51,291 --> 00:29:53,543
Hey, don't take any aggression out on me.

486
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,545
Damn it, grimlock! We are guests here!

487
00:29:57,546 --> 00:29:59,089
You got in some shit?

488
00:29:59,256 --> 00:30:00,382
Yeah, neck deep!

489
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:04,219
Cade, that's what you get
for taking the yellow bugger.

490
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:05,917
You need a leader out there,

491
00:30:05,941 --> 00:30:07,014
like me.

492
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,393
Shut up. Before I do some damage

493
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:10,682
you won't walk away from.

494
00:30:10,707 --> 00:30:12,762
You will never be Optimus Prime.

495
00:30:12,787 --> 00:30:14,067
You talk too much.

496
00:30:14,092 --> 00:30:15,706
Come on, man.
Million-year-old legendary warrior

497
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:17,497
and you act like a bunch
of junkyard dogs!

498
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:19,359
You are starting to piss me off!

499
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:26,980
Come back here, grimlock!

500
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:29,371
Turn around.
What do you got in your mouth?

501
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:34,916
I swear, I am wasting my time
protecting you.

502
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,723
Drop the cruiser right now!

503
00:30:37,049 --> 00:30:38,968
I know you got Chief Sherman's cruiser.

504
00:30:38,993 --> 00:30:40,012
Drop it!

505
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:42,871
Serves you right. Spit it out!

506
00:30:43,543 --> 00:30:44,532
Spit it!

507
00:30:54,895 --> 00:30:58,106
Don't eat cars. Don't eat cars.

508
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:01,746
You get back in your hole
and think about what you did.

509
00:31:01,811 --> 00:31:04,928
It's like the Macy's Thanksgiving day
parade out here, Jimmy J.

510
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,950
You hired me from a want ad
in the Dakota penny ledger.

511
00:31:09,281 --> 00:31:11,201
Think that comes with a superpower?

512
00:31:11,815 --> 00:31:14,607
That is a dinosaur! An alien dinosaur!

513
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:17,420
That was not in the ad!

514
00:31:17,555 --> 00:31:19,201
It tried to eat me yesterday.

515
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:21,506
You want to go to federal prison?

516
00:31:21,653 --> 00:31:23,530
No, no, I don't want to go to any prison.

517
00:31:23,555 --> 00:31:24,695
Well, that's where you are gonna go, ok?

518
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,972
Because you are aiding and abetting.

519
00:31:25,997 --> 00:31:26,956
I am a fugitive, alright?

520
00:31:26,981 --> 00:31:28,445
I am the big boss, you are my little crimey.

521
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:29,946
When you leave,

522
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:32,242
it becomes the wild kingdom out here.

523
00:31:32,267 --> 00:31:33,183
I don't know what to do.

524
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:34,514
I told you, this is a junkyard.

525
00:31:34,539 --> 00:31:36,077
They blend in with other junk.
That's it.

526
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:39,239
You hired me to be senior vice president
of worldwide operations.

527
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:41,124
Did I tell you that?
Yes, that's what you said.

528
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:42,061
I made that shit up.

529
00:31:42,134 --> 00:31:44,061
Do not take this title away from me Cade.

530
00:31:44,086 --> 00:31:45,391
This is not a start up, ok?

531
00:31:45,415 --> 00:31:47,398
I don't do this shit for money.
It's for the higher cause.

532
00:31:47,528 --> 00:31:49,604
You don't do this shit for the money?
What's wrong with you?

533
00:31:49,628 --> 00:31:51,351
How you gonna eat?
What's he doing here?

534
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:57,105
Daytrader is here.

535
00:31:57,144 --> 00:32:00,542
Here comes the most irritating,
annoying transformer on earth.

536
00:32:00,794 --> 00:32:02,212
What did he give you to get past the gate?

537
00:32:02,379 --> 00:32:03,213
Nothing!

538
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:05,465
Hey Cade. He gave him this.

539
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:07,945
I have never seen that before in my life.

540
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:10,554
Come on, say it!
You wanted the alien blaster.

541
00:32:10,579 --> 00:32:13,242
You said a big gun makes a big man.
Hey,

542
00:32:13,267 --> 00:32:14,843
you know human beings
lose their temper, right?

543
00:32:14,868 --> 00:32:16,643
Don't you dare! Hey, hey!

544
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,812
The worst senior vice president...
Stop it! Stop it!

545
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:20,969
Yeah, you are real tough!
What, you been working out?

546
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:23,650
Should I frag him?
Yes definitely frag him.

547
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:24,885
I heard that, Hound.

548
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:25,777
Easy!

549
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:27,100
Oh, god.

550
00:32:27,124 --> 00:32:29,364
You always resort to violence
right off the bat.

551
00:32:29,389 --> 00:32:30,390
I love violence.

552
00:32:30,415 --> 00:32:31,354
Daytrader!

553
00:32:31,596 --> 00:32:32,885
The hell are you doing here?

554
00:32:32,934 --> 00:32:34,370
You find our spaceship yet?

555
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:36,830
I am getting tired of hanging around here
waiting to catch a bullet.

556
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:39,808
Carbon monoxide and perhaps
a small gasoline drinking problem

557
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:42,544
are gonna kill you long before a bullet,
my corpulent comrade.

558
00:32:42,569 --> 00:32:44,296
Back off! Get out of my face.
Watch it guys.

559
00:32:44,321 --> 00:32:45,586
You want to throw down with hound?
Stop!

560
00:32:45,611 --> 00:32:46,911
Tough guy? Rude.

561
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:49,217
How about you trying
to carry all this stuff?

562
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:56,866
That's where that's been.

563
00:32:57,045 --> 00:32:58,046
Come on!

564
00:32:58,824 --> 00:33:00,100
Look what I found in buffalo.

565
00:33:00,125 --> 00:33:02,706
Starscream's head, ladies and gentlemen.

566
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:04,649
Look what I got. New voice box for Bee.

567
00:33:04,674 --> 00:33:05,859
Is it gonna work this time?

568
00:33:05,929 --> 00:33:07,656
I only got the good stuff, Cade.
Come on.

569
00:33:07,681 --> 00:33:08,808
You hear that Bee?

570
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:10,357
You are gonna talk buddy!

571
00:33:10,382 --> 00:33:11,675
<i>♪ Can't touch this! ♪</i>

572
00:33:11,828 --> 00:33:13,162
Get down Bee!

573
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:14,576
<i>♪ Too hype, can't touch this! ♪</i>

574
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:16,369
Alright, what else you got?

575
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:18,883
Where did you get that piece of junk?

576
00:33:18,945 --> 00:33:22,125
A knight of la con talisman, in this dump?

577
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:23,418
No, it's not real.

578
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:24,920
Is it? No, definitely not.

579
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,229
Hey, give it to me, I will take it off you.

580
00:33:26,573 --> 00:33:28,465
You think I don't know what the hell this is?
How valuable?

581
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:31,260
But I know it's something because
it's got you licking your chops, you skank.

582
00:33:31,702 --> 00:33:32,995
Words hurt Cade.

583
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:34,738
There are exactly seven, count them.

584
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:36,473
Seven signs of the apocalypse.

585
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:39,142
And that talisman showing up here
is numero uno.

586
00:33:39,167 --> 00:33:40,911
If that fancy pancake was real,

587
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:43,855
I would grab the spaceship
and blow this dirtball planet.

588
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,174
Alright, I am gonna go slather myself in oil.

589
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:48,735
Turn your back, drift,
if it offends your sensibilities.

590
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,058
Now that is something you can't unsee.

591
00:33:51,083 --> 00:33:52,831
I barely understand
what's coming out of your mouth.

592
00:33:52,856 --> 00:33:53,969
Hey, mister!

593
00:33:54,074 --> 00:33:55,367
This isn't happening.

594
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:58,119
You cannot stay here kid.
I got enough strays.

595
00:33:58,328 --> 00:33:59,496
I am not a kid!

596
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,039
I am useful. I fix shit.

597
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:03,083
Yeah, good for you.
Better than anyone.

598
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,459
And I have a name, you know.

599
00:34:04,613 --> 00:34:06,239
It's Izabella. Izabella with a Z.

600
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:08,856
I don't care if it's a Z,
an emoji or a dollar sign alright?

601
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,806
This is no place for...

602
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,145
Just go home. Please.

603
00:34:11,651 --> 00:34:13,152
I don't got a home.

604
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:15,879
And they...

605
00:34:16,718 --> 00:34:18,219
They just killed,

606
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:20,733
the last thing that I called family.

607
00:34:22,686 --> 00:34:23,670
So no.

608
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:27,428
I am not going anywhere.

609
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:30,348
I want to stay...

610
00:34:31,153 --> 00:34:32,356
and I want to fight them.

611
00:34:33,144 --> 00:34:34,268
You can't fight them,

612
00:34:34,417 --> 00:34:35,544
and you can't beat them.

613
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:37,661
Alright? They have the support
of the entire world.

614
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:39,683
You, you are a kid.

615
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,844
Why are you still following me?

616
00:34:49,713 --> 00:34:50,508
T!

617
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:54,342
First flames, dude!

618
00:34:55,152 --> 00:34:56,227
Mister?
Look at you!

619
00:34:56,251 --> 00:34:57,894
Perhaps your trailer is on fire.

620
00:34:58,221 --> 00:34:59,389
Wow pick corner.

621
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:00,458
Oh, my god.
Buddy!

622
00:35:00,821 --> 00:35:02,100
I am proud of you.

623
00:35:02,125 --> 00:35:04,149
I know, but you got to do it
outside now, ok?

624
00:35:04,174 --> 00:35:05,602
You could burn this whole place down.

625
00:35:05,948 --> 00:35:07,593
I know, but you are coming
into your power now.

626
00:35:07,617 --> 00:35:09,012
Alright? So you got to blow the flames...

627
00:35:09,302 --> 00:35:09,898
no.

628
00:35:13,723 --> 00:35:15,099
Terry, get me a Beer will you?

629
00:35:15,381 --> 00:35:17,216
Hey, guys, you got to cut the crap.

630
00:35:17,241 --> 00:35:18,659
You are tearing everything apart.

631
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,373
Perfect delivery buddy.
You got to work on the pickup.

632
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,800
I still got him in training.

633
00:35:29,419 --> 00:35:30,754
What happened to your family?

634
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:36,426
You first.

635
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:39,052
Wife passed away.
Daughter is at college.

636
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:40,764
She might as well be on the moon.

637
00:35:41,122 --> 00:35:42,557
At least she is still here, bro.

638
00:35:42,582 --> 00:35:44,075
I go and visit her, we both get arrested.

639
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,550
Is that bad enough for you, bro?

640
00:35:46,462 --> 00:35:48,227
Your turn, unless you are
too tough to share.

641
00:35:49,462 --> 00:35:51,071
Decepticon fired a rocket.

642
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:53,985
Parents were home, I was not.

643
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:56,386
No way I was going to foster.

644
00:35:59,256 --> 00:36:00,924
Hey, little guy.

645
00:36:01,998 --> 00:36:03,332
You are heavy!

646
00:36:03,601 --> 00:36:04,692
You got to go.

647
00:36:04,716 --> 00:36:05,979
You can't stay here.

648
00:36:06,206 --> 00:36:07,000
I am sorry.

649
00:36:12,263 --> 00:36:12,992
Fine.

650
00:36:14,268 --> 00:36:15,269
Fine.

651
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,333
I will bounce in the morning.

652
00:36:18,684 --> 00:36:21,363
Great. Look, if you are hungry,
I got some frozen pizza burritos.

653
00:36:21,388 --> 00:36:23,099
There might be some smucker's
in the fridge.

654
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:25,141
And tell everyone where you are.

655
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:27,227
Hey, am I being blackmailed
by a twelve year old?

656
00:36:28,404 --> 00:36:29,405
Fourteen.

657
00:36:29,778 --> 00:36:31,113
You know, you are really missing out.

658
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:33,123
Because it's ok to be a kid, little J-Lo.

659
00:36:34,168 --> 00:36:35,544
You think you are a bad-ass?

660
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,362
Alright tough guy,
I got a pop quiz for you.

661
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:39,766
Say you got an inline energon leak
on a Slant-6.

662
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:42,070
Don't get it fixed,
Autobot is about to bleed out.

663
00:36:42,095 --> 00:36:43,972
You got 30 seconds.
Now, what are you gonna do? Go.

664
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:46,871
Alright. First of all,
Transformers don't have a Slant-6.

665
00:36:47,033 --> 00:36:49,783
That's a Chrysler engine,
like way back in ancient history.

666
00:36:49,831 --> 00:36:51,473
The late '60s are not ancient history.

667
00:36:51,498 --> 00:36:53,033
Yeah, but if I was fixing an energon leak,

668
00:36:53,102 --> 00:36:54,450
I would cauterize the artery,

669
00:36:54,474 --> 00:36:56,147
and re-channel the central flow into the...

670
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:57,841
The whatchamacallit,
the tube with the...

671
00:36:57,866 --> 00:36:59,606
The doohickey thing.
Yeah.

672
00:36:59,981 --> 00:37:01,024
Not bad.

673
00:37:01,428 --> 00:37:02,653
Watch your mouth.

674
00:37:17,927 --> 00:37:19,061
How long has this been here?

675
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,663
It's growing. Yeah.

676
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,373
Three meters a day.

677
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:43,344
Six horns.

678
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:47,753
Six horns, six locations.

679
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,101
And they are growing at an exponential rate.

680
00:37:50,126 --> 00:37:50,961
Alien...

681
00:37:51,813 --> 00:37:52,915
whatever they are.

682
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:55,563
Chinese call them horns from hell.

683
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:57,243
Oh, my god.

684
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,486
Cybertron is coming.

685
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:00,550
What?

686
00:38:03,297 --> 00:38:05,688
I will have 17 minutes to brief
the president, what do you got for me?

687
00:38:05,712 --> 00:38:07,761
It's an unmodeled perturbation mass
and...

688
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:10,020
Look at this.
It's amazing this thing flies at all.

689
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:12,832
Is it some kind of neck cancer?

690
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:15,379
No. It's much worse than that.

691
00:38:16,019 --> 00:38:19,856
It's a gravitational anomaly
caused by a planet-sized object

692
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:22,133
with a current velocity of 1/10th light speed.

693
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:25,053
That's some geek stuff. Is it a threat?

694
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:26,626
If you just give me...

695
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:28,723
No, I got a lunch. No.

696
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:31,559
No, it's not a threat.

697
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,148
A threat might kill you.

698
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:35,968
This will kill you...

699
00:38:36,536 --> 00:38:38,066
in three clays.

700
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,868
How much do you weigh?

701
00:38:45,135 --> 00:38:47,240
Are you technically considered overweight?

702
00:38:47,514 --> 00:38:48,815
No. It's just all my gear.

703
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:52,209
It's like somebody packed 10 pounds
of shit in a five-pound sack.

704
00:38:52,484 --> 00:38:54,115
No, he is a chunky Autobot.

705
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:55,589
You wanna stop that?

706
00:38:55,614 --> 00:38:57,183
Hound, pull up the sat phone.

707
00:38:58,148 --> 00:39:01,862
I am bouncing a signal through Portugal,
Istanbul and Katmandu.

708
00:39:02,319 --> 00:39:04,088
You got 20 seconds Chief.

709
00:39:07,885 --> 00:39:10,526
Really?
Infestation of puppy Transformers.

710
00:39:10,674 --> 00:39:12,604
This here is a big boy zone.

711
00:39:13,957 --> 00:39:14,809
<i>Hello?</i>

712
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:16,754
<i>Hello? Dad?</i>

713
00:39:17,918 --> 00:39:18,928
<i>Look, I know...</i>

714
00:39:18,952 --> 00:39:20,988
<i>I know you can't talk to me</i>

715
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:23,129
<i>or say anything back.</i>

716
00:39:23,841 --> 00:39:25,307
<i>But you can listen.</i>

717
00:39:28,028 --> 00:39:30,642
<i>I am gonna say what I always
say until you hear me.</i>

718
00:39:31,993 --> 00:39:34,096
<i>You don't need to save the world.</i>

719
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:36,619
<i>You need a frigging girlfriend.</i>

720
00:39:38,355 --> 00:39:40,908
<i>Wherever you are,
I don't want you to die alone.</i>

721
00:39:42,182 --> 00:39:44,652
<i>And I know you only got five seconds left, so...</i>

722
00:39:45,959 --> 00:39:46,998
<i>I am fine,</i>

723
00:39:47,248 --> 00:39:48,226
<i>I am safe.</i>

724
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,026
<i>And I love...</i>

725
00:39:55,427 --> 00:39:56,424
Any longer,

726
00:39:56,448 --> 00:39:58,165
they would have snagged our location.

727
00:39:59,533 --> 00:40:01,735
You are a hell of a father Cade.
Don't forget it.

728
00:40:02,014 --> 00:40:03,916
Hell, my dad never called me.

729
00:40:12,861 --> 00:40:14,103
We call it the Tank.

730
00:40:14,888 --> 00:40:16,243
He likes it down here.

731
00:40:17,194 --> 00:40:19,142
This is where I deal with the dark shit.

732
00:40:19,987 --> 00:40:21,949
Decepticons seem just as interested,

733
00:40:22,263 --> 00:40:24,233
in these structures as we are.

734
00:40:24,444 --> 00:40:26,990
Pred snapped this, in Siberia.

735
00:40:27,404 --> 00:40:30,902
He has been seen at all six horn
locations around the world.

736
00:40:31,042 --> 00:40:32,418
ID confirmed.

737
00:40:32,652 --> 00:40:33,808
Megatron.

738
00:40:34,677 --> 00:40:35,796
And get this.

739
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:38,066
He made contact with TRF.

740
00:40:38,305 --> 00:40:40,301
Snatched up two CIA case officers.

741
00:40:40,325 --> 00:40:42,109
Said he wants to negotiate.

742
00:40:42,134 --> 00:40:43,054
With him?

743
00:40:43,202 --> 00:40:44,427
What the hell does he want?

744
00:40:44,454 --> 00:40:47,204
Certain alien associates of his released.

745
00:40:47,899 --> 00:40:50,384
<i>Scheduled contact is ID'd and cleared.</i>

746
00:40:51,428 --> 00:40:53,756
<i>Confirmation.
Hostages are clear.</i>

747
00:40:53,982 --> 00:40:55,716
The Department of Justice has okayed it

748
00:40:55,741 --> 00:40:58,364
so long as the US military
watches his every move.

749
00:40:58,787 --> 00:41:01,981
You are gonna be on point,
because he is not our friend.

750
00:41:05,442 --> 00:41:07,104
You know who they always kill first?

751
00:41:11,046 --> 00:41:12,088
Lawyers.

752
00:41:12,965 --> 00:41:16,555
We have made deals with the devil
before during times of crisis.

753
00:41:16,653 --> 00:41:17,921
If we are gonna get through this,

754
00:41:17,946 --> 00:41:19,648
we have got to open the door...

755
00:41:19,837 --> 00:41:21,739
and let the monsters inside.

756
00:41:22,325 --> 00:41:23,677
There is a weapon out there...

757
00:41:23,825 --> 00:41:25,953
of unimaginable power.

758
00:41:26,171 --> 00:41:28,210
A threat to our very existence.

759
00:41:28,498 --> 00:41:30,467
And Megatron can lead us to it.

760
00:41:31,701 --> 00:41:34,592
Do I know you, human?

761
00:41:34,982 --> 00:41:37,881
I want my crew!
Give me names!

762
00:41:38,087 --> 00:41:39,485
Mohawk.

763
00:41:40,071 --> 00:41:41,227
Mohawk?

764
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:44,365
What up, fellas?

765
00:41:44,482 --> 00:41:46,076
Man, I want to kill you right now.

766
00:41:50,053 --> 00:41:51,121
But I am kill you later.

767
00:41:51,154 --> 00:41:53,074
Definitely gonna kill you all mofos later.

768
00:41:54,037 --> 00:41:55,167
He is cleared!

769
00:41:55,425 --> 00:41:56,407
Alright.

770
00:41:57,611 --> 00:41:58,849
Dreadbot.

771
00:42:00,998 --> 00:42:02,758
Dreadbot, in for...

772
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,466
bank robbery.

773
00:42:06,015 --> 00:42:07,671
Aggravated assault.
Murder.

774
00:42:07,696 --> 00:42:09,531
Double murder. Triple murder.
Nine dead.

775
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:11,529
Didn't even take the money. No.

776
00:42:11,774 --> 00:42:13,176
We are not letting him out, no.

777
00:42:16,234 --> 00:42:17,088
What?

778
00:42:17,763 --> 00:42:19,698
I mean but we can be flexible.

779
00:42:19,723 --> 00:42:21,385
If he wears a GPS tracker, it's fine.

780
00:42:21,451 --> 00:42:22,452
Ok, ok.

781
00:42:22,632 --> 00:42:23,494
Ok.

782
00:42:24,487 --> 00:42:26,291
Nitro Zeus.

783
00:42:26,316 --> 00:42:27,807
Baby, free at last!

784
00:42:27,832 --> 00:42:30,276
Thank Megatron, I am free at last!

785
00:42:32,313 --> 00:42:34,615
Thank you.
Gonna miss you Tim.

786
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,109
Thank you for your hospitality, Brad.

787
00:42:37,134 --> 00:42:39,169
I know where you live Enrique.

788
00:42:39,263 --> 00:42:41,617
Say hello to your wife for me.

789
00:42:41,761 --> 00:42:44,898
But the government requests that
he does not leave the county.

790
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:47,156
And we are serious about that.
Ok.

791
00:42:47,932 --> 00:42:48,640
Ok.

792
00:42:49,289 --> 00:42:53,195
And last but not least Berserker.

793
00:42:54,128 --> 00:42:55,864
I will suck your brains!

794
00:42:58,255 --> 00:42:59,896
Absolutely not.
Yeah. No.

795
00:42:59,921 --> 00:43:02,223
No. No. There are limits.
Pick again.

796
00:43:02,325 --> 00:43:03,893
Onslaught.

797
00:43:03,918 --> 00:43:05,920
You need a bigger door!

798
00:43:08,121 --> 00:43:09,074
I...

799
00:43:09,671 --> 00:43:11,620
Let me run that up the flag pole real quick.

800
00:43:11,645 --> 00:43:13,080
I just got to call someone.

801
00:43:13,863 --> 00:43:15,675
Great, thank you. Yes. Yes!

802
00:43:18,241 --> 00:43:19,740
What do you really want Megatron?

803
00:43:19,765 --> 00:43:22,067
What anyone wants human.

804
00:43:22,665 --> 00:43:24,201
To go home.

805
00:43:24,581 --> 00:43:26,049
Yeah, that had be alright with me too.

806
00:43:26,074 --> 00:43:28,924
Megatron, he is after something Yeager has.

807
00:43:28,949 --> 00:43:31,620
Something they need
to help find this weapon.

808
00:43:32,082 --> 00:43:34,618
We are gonna let those
Decepticons do our dirty work.

809
00:43:34,643 --> 00:43:37,650
On my go, they will be given
Yeager's hideout coordinates.

810
00:43:38,394 --> 00:43:40,603
You track Megatron every step.

811
00:43:41,204 --> 00:43:42,305
Take the weapon.

812
00:43:42,996 --> 00:43:44,564
And then I am taking his ass out.

813
00:43:45,013 --> 00:43:46,153
No fear.

814
00:43:46,575 --> 00:43:47,863
No hate.

815
00:43:48,066 --> 00:43:49,727
No anger.

816
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:00,437
Hey, guys.

817
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:02,586
Rise and shine.

818
00:44:02,859 --> 00:44:04,148
Top of the morning!

819
00:44:07,905 --> 00:44:09,663
Broke our asses bagging these Decepticons.

820
00:44:09,688 --> 00:44:10,722
Now they let them out?

821
00:44:11,442 --> 00:44:12,665
What's really going on, Lennox?

822
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:13,969
Classified.

823
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:15,485
Just run your team.

824
00:44:23,453 --> 00:44:24,719
Today,

825
00:44:25,462 --> 00:44:27,109
we hunt.

826
00:44:27,887 --> 00:44:30,723
Another glorious, boring day.

827
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,179
<i>Air is gonna be on station.</i>

828
00:44:37,204 --> 00:44:39,973
<i>We are gonna have all EOIR sensors
on these guys as they move.</i>

829
00:44:40,269 --> 00:44:42,038
<i>Flight, push tactical when airborne.</i>

830
00:44:42,843 --> 00:44:44,821
I want air ops locking down this transport.

831
00:44:44,846 --> 00:44:46,948
Decepticons in sight 100%.

832
00:44:46,973 --> 00:44:49,413
Decepticons have just
been given Yeager's location.

833
00:44:54,121 --> 00:44:56,786
<i>Cyclops. Decepticons
approaching junkyard target.</i>

834
00:44:59,068 --> 00:45:01,216
You strapping on a Decepticon arm?

835
00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:04,497
Perfecto.

836
00:45:05,388 --> 00:45:06,982
Well, he was an ugly little robot.

837
00:45:07,613 --> 00:45:09,850
You look like a warrior Sqweeks.

838
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:11,319
Muy guapo.

839
00:45:12,012 --> 00:45:13,091
Here goes Bee.

840
00:45:13,269 --> 00:45:14,837
Just do whatever you want.

841
00:45:15,725 --> 00:45:18,045
Hey Z, come on over here
and work on a real bot.

842
00:45:18,070 --> 00:45:19,404
Doc, come in Doc.

843
00:45:24,634 --> 00:45:25,635
Oh, that's it.

844
00:45:26,524 --> 00:45:27,871
No, third one on your left.

845
00:45:28,339 --> 00:45:30,107
No. Wait.
Your left. Right here.

846
00:45:30,132 --> 00:45:32,434
I know what I am doing.
Don't rush me.

847
00:45:32,885 --> 00:45:34,553
Hey, calm the temper, ok?

848
00:45:34,977 --> 00:45:36,313
Think he likes this?

849
00:45:36,489 --> 00:45:37,799
It's like being in a dentist's chair.

850
00:45:37,824 --> 00:45:39,183
Do you like the dentist?

851
00:45:39,347 --> 00:45:40,261
No.

852
00:45:41,718 --> 00:45:43,308
Hound said you can only listen to her.

853
00:45:44,348 --> 00:45:45,356
Your daughter.

854
00:45:45,638 --> 00:45:46,975
You can't talk back.

855
00:45:47,590 --> 00:45:48,938
He is got a big mouth.

856
00:45:50,097 --> 00:45:52,066
Said if you do, they can voice match you

857
00:45:52,295 --> 00:45:54,406
from some computer somewhere
and track you down.

858
00:45:54,664 --> 00:45:56,219
Well, that's the world we live in.

859
00:45:59,908 --> 00:46:01,110
What would you say to her?

860
00:46:03,188 --> 00:46:04,623
Brush your teeth, work hard.

861
00:46:05,608 --> 00:46:07,943
Stay away from any boy in a band,
especially a drummer.

862
00:46:07,968 --> 00:46:10,662
Yeah, drummers are the worst,
not to mention stupid!

863
00:46:11,087 --> 00:46:13,295
And DJs? Real dickheads.
Come on.

864
00:46:16,318 --> 00:46:18,593
We had a thing. Alright?
A saying back and forth.

865
00:46:18,618 --> 00:46:20,719
She would always ask me,
Dad, what are you doing tomorrow?

866
00:46:20,744 --> 00:46:22,524
And I would say,
I will figure it out tomorrow.

867
00:46:25,398 --> 00:46:27,688
Looks to me like you are running
out of tomorrows, Yeager.

868
00:46:29,432 --> 00:46:30,884
That's just what she would say.

869
00:46:34,036 --> 00:46:35,009
Ok Bee.

870
00:46:35,214 --> 00:46:36,215
Done.

871
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,201
Come on buddy, sit up.
Let's hear it.

872
00:46:40,467 --> 00:46:41,381
Come on.

873
00:46:42,242 --> 00:46:43,414
Your real voice.

874
00:46:43,438 --> 00:46:44,978
For the first time buddy.
Belt it out.

875
00:46:45,293 --> 00:46:46,701
This is so exciting.

876
00:46:46,896 --> 00:46:49,326
Oh, no. This isn't my damn voice.

877
00:46:50,019 --> 00:46:51,146
I am gonna kill him, Bee.

878
00:46:51,171 --> 00:46:52,239
This is such bullshit.

879
00:46:52,264 --> 00:46:53,529
Ok, you know what?
I am not giving up.

880
00:46:53,554 --> 00:46:55,365
Alright? You are gonna speak
with your own voice one day.

881
00:46:55,390 --> 00:46:57,263
Daytrader is a punk-ass bitch.

882
00:47:05,677 --> 00:47:06,478
Cade.

883
00:47:06,778 --> 00:47:08,676
That thing he...
That code.

884
00:47:08,871 --> 00:47:11,350
Is a red. Red thing is...
There is somebody coming.

885
00:47:11,375 --> 00:47:12,253
Shit!

886
00:47:17,472 --> 00:47:19,168
<i>Reaper has eyes on junkyard.</i>

887
00:47:20,804 --> 00:47:22,543
<i>We have PID on Kingfish.</i>

888
00:47:25,212 --> 00:47:27,981
Halt! This is protected land!

889
00:47:29,618 --> 00:47:31,423
Sixty seconds to evac!
Let's move!

890
00:47:35,271 --> 00:47:37,116
Cyclops, it appears Kingfish is on the move.

891
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:38,235
They know.

892
00:47:38,556 --> 00:47:40,055
We are blown guys!
We got to roll out now!

893
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:41,156
Hey, those are the Feds.

894
00:47:41,227 --> 00:47:42,875
I know the government
when I see the government.

895
00:47:43,625 --> 00:47:45,281
Grab as many weapons as you can.

896
00:47:45,852 --> 00:47:47,946
I am not going to jail.
I can't go to jail, man.

897
00:47:47,971 --> 00:47:49,977
Hey! This is the real world.
Ok? Let's go!

898
00:47:50,002 --> 00:47:51,915
I can't go to jail.
I am too skinny for jail.

899
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:53,141
I can't even lift weights.

900
00:47:57,512 --> 00:47:58,432
Bee, let's move!

901
00:47:58,457 --> 00:48:00,190
Give me this one.
You definitely give me this one.

902
00:48:00,215 --> 00:48:01,689
This will mess somebody up good.

903
00:48:02,064 --> 00:48:04,095
Roll out of here Cade.
I am gonna buy you some time.

904
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:06,151
Don't be a hero Hound.
We are out of here now!

905
00:48:06,176 --> 00:48:06,815
Wait! Wait!

906
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:08,120
Hell, I was born a hero.

907
00:48:08,145 --> 00:48:09,135
You are not leaving me!

908
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:10,823
You leave me, they take Sqweeks.

909
00:48:10,848 --> 00:48:12,783
Leave Sqweeks!
He is a survivor.

910
00:48:23,717 --> 00:48:25,347
Megatron, they got up out of here.

911
00:48:25,489 --> 00:48:27,723
I kicked more ass in prison.

912
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:32,551
The end is near, my old treacherous friend.

913
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:33,641
This coming!

914
00:48:33,727 --> 00:48:35,067
What a shame,

915
00:48:35,318 --> 00:48:37,404
you will be unable to see it.

916
00:48:41,349 --> 00:48:43,295
Come and get some, you little bitch!

917
00:48:58,065 --> 00:48:59,208
<i>Coming your way, Lennox.</i>

918
00:48:59,233 --> 00:49:01,471
We box these things in,
they will protect themselves.

919
00:49:01,661 --> 00:49:03,057
Yeah, we will see.

920
00:49:06,978 --> 00:49:08,412
Tactical positions, let's go!

921
00:49:14,909 --> 00:49:16,831
You too knuckle-dragger.
Stay out of sight. Come on.

922
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:20,099
Decepticons are coming.

923
00:49:20,124 --> 00:49:21,029
Alright.

924
00:49:21,053 --> 00:49:22,823
We all know our hiding places.

925
00:49:23,371 --> 00:49:24,408
What's this?

926
00:49:24,432 --> 00:49:26,113
The tracker brought them right to us.

927
00:49:26,138 --> 00:49:28,173
When are you going to grow up?
Dang it.

928
00:49:29,419 --> 00:49:32,161
<i>Target is four klicks away.
They just entered an abandoned town.</i>

929
00:49:53,397 --> 00:49:55,099
Let's go. Out! Out! Out! Out!

930
00:50:07,450 --> 00:50:08,194
Hey!

931
00:50:08,646 --> 00:50:10,630
Yeager's got vital Intel.
Detain only.

932
00:50:10,655 --> 00:50:12,911
TRF operation.
Stay out of my way.

933
00:50:13,416 --> 00:50:15,294
Those were my men.

934
00:50:16,341 --> 00:50:18,744
Hey, there is some
scary shit going on out there.

935
00:50:18,769 --> 00:50:21,089
I would like to at least keep my blaster.
Not today.

936
00:50:21,113 --> 00:50:22,377
We are sticking to the plan.

937
00:50:22,402 --> 00:50:23,762
The whole town is wired and rigged.

938
00:50:23,787 --> 00:50:26,156
You! Sit down.
Now. Stay put.

939
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:44,446
Just a heads up.

940
00:50:44,470 --> 00:50:46,372
We are probably going to jail so...

941
00:50:46,623 --> 00:50:48,294
try getting used to that.

942
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:52,513
Here they come.

943
00:50:56,914 --> 00:50:58,169
Autobots get ready.

944
00:50:58,578 --> 00:51:00,580
Hey Cade, you mind if I bail?

945
00:51:00,605 --> 00:51:02,065
Don't attack until I say.

946
00:51:03,586 --> 00:51:06,010
Yeah, Decepticons is in the streets.

947
00:51:06,035 --> 00:51:08,651
Oh, I feel a fight coming.
I'ma kill you alright now.

948
00:51:08,676 --> 00:51:10,311
Search this town.

949
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,367
He is here.

950
00:51:12,636 --> 00:51:14,703
I am letting you all know
what we came to do.

951
00:51:18,271 --> 00:51:19,609
Get over here!

952
00:51:21,462 --> 00:51:23,712
Look at that little blue beetle-looking mofo.

953
00:51:26,561 --> 00:51:28,025
Look at this little ugly dude.

954
00:51:28,598 --> 00:51:31,118
You are awash in their repulsive scent.

955
00:51:31,433 --> 00:51:33,074
Disgusting.

956
00:51:33,399 --> 00:51:35,066
Hey!
Bee, stop her.

957
00:51:35,256 --> 00:51:37,224
Put him down!

958
00:51:37,383 --> 00:51:38,917
No. No, no, no, no.
Here she go.

959
00:51:38,941 --> 00:51:40,908
Look at her,
walking all strong with pigtails.

960
00:51:40,933 --> 00:51:42,034
Go to hell!

961
00:51:42,379 --> 00:51:44,158
This planet is hell.

962
00:51:45,347 --> 00:51:46,745
What's that on your arm?

963
00:51:47,392 --> 00:51:49,594
Put him down!
Shit!

964
00:51:49,619 --> 00:51:51,646
You think I am afraid of you, cabron?
Hey, stop!

965
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:53,341
Cade Yeager.

966
00:51:53,366 --> 00:51:55,142
I need that talisman!

967
00:52:03,595 --> 00:52:05,297
We don't do this kamikaze shit.

968
00:52:05,479 --> 00:52:07,490
You wanna go out there and start
screaming at a Decepticon?

969
00:52:07,514 --> 00:52:08,901
Get those vile beings.

970
00:52:08,926 --> 00:52:09,861
I am on them!

971
00:52:35,765 --> 00:52:37,099
I got the leg!

972
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:38,835
Gotcha!

973
00:52:40,102 --> 00:52:41,422
And his fat head.

974
00:52:41,447 --> 00:52:43,316
Don't get any better than that.

975
00:52:43,341 --> 00:52:44,509
Drift, now!

976
00:52:44,977 --> 00:52:47,750
Decepticons retreat!

977
00:52:47,775 --> 00:52:48,776
Chickens!

978
00:52:50,792 --> 00:52:52,398
That plan went to shit.

979
00:52:56,579 --> 00:52:57,984
That's the only plan you got?

980
00:52:58,612 --> 00:52:59,879
Get down, get down, get down!

981
00:53:03,272 --> 00:53:04,373
What are those?

982
00:53:04,398 --> 00:53:05,334
TRF.

983
00:53:06,513 --> 00:53:08,373
We got to get inside.
Come on. Run.

984
00:53:08,724 --> 00:53:10,356
This is supposed to hunt terrorists,

985
00:53:10,381 --> 00:53:11,786
not tax-paying Americans!

986
00:53:11,811 --> 00:53:13,379
Not that I pay taxes but...

987
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:15,802
Yo, Meg! M-tron!

988
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:18,016
Stop playing. Come on.

989
00:53:18,165 --> 00:53:19,568
Am I the only one in here?

990
00:53:23,944 --> 00:53:25,482
Oh, this ain't right.

991
00:53:32,639 --> 00:53:33,701
We are safe in here.

992
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:35,076
There is always one in charge.

993
00:53:35,101 --> 00:53:37,037
Just like back in Chicago, like a mother.

994
00:53:54,764 --> 00:53:55,965
Go, go, go!

995
00:53:57,534 --> 00:53:58,300
Run!

996
00:53:58,618 --> 00:53:59,768
Move, move, move!

997
00:54:07,544 --> 00:54:08,578
Hide in that room!

998
00:54:09,011 --> 00:54:10,447
Come on, come on, come on!

999
00:54:14,551 --> 00:54:16,990
I left the 'hood to not get shot
and now I am getting shot.

1000
00:54:17,454 --> 00:54:18,842
This is the worst job ever.

1001
00:54:19,410 --> 00:54:20,864
Does this job even have healthcare?

1002
00:54:20,889 --> 00:54:22,170
It doesn't, do it?

1003
00:54:22,195 --> 00:54:24,063
You try treating a bullet wound by yourself.

1004
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:25,754
Watch out!

1005
00:54:29,031 --> 00:54:30,333
Run! Run!

1006
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:40,677
Hide! Hide!

1007
00:54:53,055 --> 00:54:54,767
<i>Facial mapping engaged.</i>

1008
00:54:55,157 --> 00:54:56,617
You are a dead man.

1009
00:55:11,374 --> 00:55:12,609
Oh, shit.
There is another one.

1010
00:55:14,744 --> 00:55:15,800
I got this.

1011
00:55:16,056 --> 00:55:17,337
What are you doing?

1012
00:55:17,362 --> 00:55:18,634
It's using facial recognition.

1013
00:55:20,383 --> 00:55:21,943
Are you crazy?

1014
00:55:22,394 --> 00:55:23,695
Stay behind me.
What?

1015
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:25,422
Jimmy J, don't!
I got this, get behind me.

1016
00:55:25,455 --> 00:55:26,689
Don't do it.
Get behind me.

1017
00:55:26,723 --> 00:55:27,854
It's a bad idea!

1018
00:55:29,091 --> 00:55:30,003
Shit.

1019
00:55:32,795 --> 00:55:34,395
Oh, my gosh. Are you ok?

1020
00:55:38,635 --> 00:55:42,339
Cade, I just want to tell you
I love you, man.

1021
00:55:42,739 --> 00:55:43,702
What?

1022
00:55:43,728 --> 00:55:45,820
This job was not what I thought,
but I appreciate everything.

1023
00:55:45,863 --> 00:55:47,692
What are you doing?
I am dying!

1024
00:55:48,869 --> 00:55:49,989
It was only a beanbag dude.

1025
00:55:51,798 --> 00:55:52,866
There is no hole?

1026
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:54,427
There is no hole,
there is no blood, no nothing.

1027
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:55,937
There is no hole.
Will you get up?

1028
00:55:55,962 --> 00:55:57,109
Stop trying to act like a hero.

1029
00:55:57,134 --> 00:55:59,767
It was a beanbag?
That shit hurt like a bullet, man!

1030
00:55:59,792 --> 00:56:00,927
I felt it go through me!

1031
00:56:01,424 --> 00:56:02,847
Come on, that building right there!

1032
00:56:09,279 --> 00:56:10,657
There is always one in charge!

1033
00:56:10,838 --> 00:56:13,150
Alright, we take out the big one,
we are gonna take them all out.

1034
00:56:16,883 --> 00:56:18,965
Come on, come on, come on.
Hurry, hurry, they are coming.

1035
00:56:22,445 --> 00:56:25,015
Oh, my God! A leprechaun.
Who the hell are you?

1036
00:56:25,582 --> 00:56:27,742
Leprechauns are tiny, green and Irish,

1037
00:56:27,767 --> 00:56:29,218
and that is offensive.

1038
00:56:29,452 --> 00:56:30,892
What are you looking at, little girl?

1039
00:56:31,153 --> 00:56:32,464
What are you looking at?

1040
00:56:33,433 --> 00:56:36,207
Hello. Master Cade,
I have been sent to collect you.

1041
00:56:36,426 --> 00:56:37,863
Collect me?
That is correct.

1042
00:56:37,888 --> 00:56:39,472
Oh, you are not collecting shit.

1043
00:56:44,305 --> 00:56:46,165
Man! Slow down!
So, you want to play rough.

1044
00:56:51,173 --> 00:56:52,884
No! No! Cade!

1045
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:54,343
Oh, shit!
Cade!

1046
00:56:54,644 --> 00:56:56,307
Cade! Cade!
Hold on!

1047
00:57:01,484 --> 00:57:02,819
Did you see that?
Hang on!

1048
00:57:02,993 --> 00:57:04,662
Oh, I am so clumsy!

1049
00:57:04,787 --> 00:57:06,656
Is he still alive?
Hold on!

1050
00:57:06,689 --> 00:57:08,273
Is he still living?

1051
00:57:08,375 --> 00:57:10,110
No, he is going to die!

1052
00:57:14,404 --> 00:57:15,902
My lord, this is not my fault,

1053
00:57:15,927 --> 00:57:18,084
but he just burst out of the elevator.

1054
00:57:18,334 --> 00:57:19,936
<i>Ten stories.</i>
Oh, my God.

1055
00:57:19,969 --> 00:57:21,535
<i>Did you have a backup plan, sir?</i>

1056
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:23,806
Did he live?
<i>I don't know, he just flew!</i>

1057
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:38,154
My lord, rip an arm off a human

1058
00:57:38,187 --> 00:57:39,725
and they will go wherever you want.

1059
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:40,976
<i>What's the matter with you?</i>

1060
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:18,695
You little gnats.

1061
00:58:19,629 --> 00:58:22,195
Oh, there you are.
Good to find you alive!

1062
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:23,603
Just like nothing happened.

1063
00:58:24,009 --> 00:58:26,266
Let's make you presentable.
Hey! Come on!

1064
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:28,063
Shiny, spic and span.

1065
00:58:28,088 --> 00:58:29,649
Back off, Jeeves!
There.

1066
00:58:29,674 --> 00:58:31,563
You look better already sir.
Who are you?

1067
00:58:31,588 --> 00:58:34,634
My name is Cogman sir.
And I am here because of that.

1068
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:37,390
And that is here because of you.

1069
00:58:37,911 --> 00:58:41,187
It will not leave you
until your quest is fulfilled.

1070
00:58:43,008 --> 00:58:44,877
You have been chosen.

1071
00:58:46,531 --> 00:58:47,632
What do you mean chosen?

1072
00:58:47,657 --> 00:58:50,100
I will explain everything
if you will kindly come with me.

1073
00:58:50,125 --> 00:58:52,537
Hey Cade, what's with this C-3PO rip-off?

1074
00:58:52,562 --> 00:58:53,942
Don't kill the messenger

1075
00:58:53,967 --> 00:58:55,820
or the messenger will kill you.

1076
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:02,964
Now then, I am afraid all this
ballyhoo is on your account.

1077
00:59:02,989 --> 00:59:05,113
If you want to save your friends,

1078
00:59:05,137 --> 00:59:06,660
you will leave them.

1079
00:59:06,685 --> 00:59:07,603
Hey, don't talk to that leprechaun!

1080
00:59:07,628 --> 00:59:09,286
What, and run off
with some crazy ninja butler?

1081
00:59:09,311 --> 00:59:11,756
Your friends will be safe in your absence.

1082
00:59:11,781 --> 00:59:13,883
In your presence, unsafe.

1083
00:59:14,283 --> 00:59:18,032
You are more important
than you can possibly imagine.

1084
00:59:18,588 --> 00:59:20,590
You are needed sir.

1085
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:21,938
Urgently.

1086
00:59:22,592 --> 00:59:24,202
My master is fond of saying

1087
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:26,186
that all the important decisions in life

1088
00:59:26,211 --> 00:59:30,567
often come down to just one moment.

1089
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:40,148
You are gonna be alright.

1090
00:59:40,374 --> 00:59:41,494
You are family now.

1091
00:59:41,944 --> 00:59:43,620
They are gonna take care of you,
I promise.

1092
00:59:44,269 --> 00:59:45,564
The plane is waiting.

1093
00:59:45,625 --> 00:59:47,040
We are going to England.

1094
00:59:47,065 --> 00:59:47,850
Bee?

1095
00:59:49,018 --> 00:59:52,368
Listen up Little Miss Sunshine,
I am in charge now.

1096
00:59:53,363 --> 00:59:56,299
Just don't expect any bedtime stories.

1097
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:05,218
Welcome to Air Folgan.

1098
01:00:05,243 --> 01:00:07,336
Please strap in.
Turbulence can kill.

1099
01:00:07,369 --> 01:00:09,234
There will be no snack service on this flight,

1100
01:00:09,274 --> 01:00:10,822
no drinks, no fun.

1101
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:13,576
Tracking Yeager.
He is over the pond right now.

1102
01:00:13,985 --> 01:00:16,020
It took some finding but sats have him.

1103
01:00:16,045 --> 01:00:17,880
Megatron and crew are
bearing down on the UK.

1104
01:00:17,914 --> 01:00:20,078
So is Yeager.
It's no coincidence.

1105
01:00:21,255 --> 01:00:25,026
I want you airborne with
your team to the UK ASAP.

1106
01:00:28,582 --> 01:00:29,482
Pick up. Pick up.

1107
01:00:32,091 --> 01:00:33,023
Yeah?
Don't hang up!

1108
01:00:33,048 --> 01:00:33,985
It's you again.

1109
01:00:34,044 --> 01:00:35,805
I have told you, you have nothing to offer.

1110
01:00:35,829 --> 01:00:36,674
Get lost.

1111
01:00:36,699 --> 01:00:39,299
I need a favor Folgers.
I would do it myself but I can't.

1112
01:00:39,324 --> 01:00:41,542
You ever fly a Cuban airplane?
They are from the 1940s.

1113
01:00:41,566 --> 01:00:42,571
So are the pilots.

1114
01:00:42,705 --> 01:00:44,199
<i>Book of Cyber-Kells.</i>

1115
01:00:44,373 --> 01:00:45,363
I found it.

1116
01:00:45,388 --> 01:00:46,949
<i>The ancient book?
Impossible.</i>

1117
01:00:46,974 --> 01:00:49,013
Not when you know the right janitor.
And I know many.

1118
01:00:49,038 --> 01:00:51,695
The book exists.
Unseen for centuries.

1119
01:00:51,848 --> 01:00:54,527
Pages that, literally dissolve
at room temperature,

1120
01:00:54,552 --> 01:00:57,544
made from some
old kind of goat scrotum or something.

1121
01:00:57,755 --> 01:00:58,935
Trinity Library.

1122
01:00:58,959 --> 01:01:00,427
Today, 4.00 p.m.

1123
01:01:00,723 --> 01:01:02,825
Be there, if you want to know how it all ends.

1124
01:01:08,931 --> 01:01:12,001
<i>Object confirmed as exoplanet Cybertron.</i>

1125
01:01:13,936 --> 01:01:16,242
<i>Two days, seven hours to impact.</i>

1126
01:01:21,811 --> 01:01:22,875
Optimus,

1127
01:01:23,047 --> 01:01:25,029
it is time you knew the truth.

1128
01:01:25,414 --> 01:01:27,215
The place you call Earth

1129
01:01:27,699 --> 01:01:29,173
has another name.

1130
01:01:29,829 --> 01:01:31,004
Unicron.

1131
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:34,700
Earth... Unicron?

1132
01:01:36,203 --> 01:01:38,562
Cybertron's ancient enemy.

1133
01:01:39,428 --> 01:01:40,468
Yes.

1134
01:01:40,897 --> 01:01:42,832
You are going to kill him.

1135
01:01:43,547 --> 01:01:47,520
With my staff, we will drain
the very life from Unicron.

1136
01:01:48,363 --> 01:01:51,457
Earth will die...
Yes.

1137
01:01:51,482 --> 01:01:53,926
And your world will be reborn,

1138
01:01:54,436 --> 01:01:56,658
Nemesis Prime.

1139
01:01:58,014 --> 01:02:00,413
I will fight anyone,

1140
01:02:00,437 --> 01:02:02,852
who stands in my way.

1141
01:02:04,787 --> 01:02:06,591
<i>The alien horns are still growing,</i>

1142
01:02:06,787 --> 01:02:08,958
<i>some of them reaching 400 meters.</i>

1143
01:02:08,991 --> 01:02:11,318
More alien rubbish.

1144
01:02:11,740 --> 01:02:13,675
Have you found a man yet, Viviane?

1145
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:15,521
No.
So sad.

1146
01:02:15,546 --> 01:02:16,864
You should really look in here.

1147
01:02:16,889 --> 01:02:20,077
I mean, there are lots of adverts,
some of them very tempting.

1148
01:02:20,102 --> 01:02:22,839
This one is looking for a BBW.
I don't know what that is.

1149
01:02:22,872 --> 01:02:24,173
It's a car dear.
Right.

1150
01:02:24,206 --> 01:02:25,674
Big Beautiful Woman.

1151
01:02:25,842 --> 01:02:27,243
Is it? Who knew?

1152
01:02:27,590 --> 01:02:29,078
Looking at the classifieds!

1153
01:02:29,103 --> 01:02:31,447
Oh, this one is got its own dungeon.

1154
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:33,783
Great! I love dungeons!

1155
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:35,785
See, that's perfect for you, isn't it?

1156
01:02:35,818 --> 01:02:37,376
All that old stuff, you would love that.

1157
01:02:37,787 --> 01:02:40,500
History is being rewritten
and you want to talk about a man.

1158
01:02:40,525 --> 01:02:41,490
Or a woman.

1159
01:02:42,259 --> 01:02:43,056
Aunt Helen.

1160
01:02:43,112 --> 01:02:44,646
Women Seeking Women.
Here we go.

1161
01:02:45,995 --> 01:02:47,830
You could ask me about my work.

1162
01:02:47,855 --> 01:02:49,182
Why would we do that?

1163
01:02:49,231 --> 01:02:51,734
I mean it's just... dusty old books.

1164
01:02:51,759 --> 01:02:53,188
Now I welcome the end of days!

1165
01:02:53,213 --> 01:02:56,806
What's so terrible about me wanting you
to have what I had with your father?

1166
01:02:56,906 --> 01:02:58,002
He was an ass.

1167
01:02:58,027 --> 01:02:59,377
Do you know what Father didn't have?

1168
01:02:59,508 --> 01:03:01,978
The one thing that his beloved
Knights of the Round Table

1169
01:03:02,011 --> 01:03:04,237
had in spades and he was utterly lacking?

1170
01:03:04,981 --> 01:03:05,982
Honor.

1171
01:03:06,062 --> 01:03:07,503
You can say that again.

1172
01:03:07,584 --> 01:03:10,253
If you can stop loathing
a dead man long enough,

1173
01:03:10,552 --> 01:03:12,236
you might want to have a look in his study.

1174
01:03:12,261 --> 01:03:13,403
All that rubbish.

1175
01:03:13,450 --> 01:03:14,942
There might be something
you want to keep.

1176
01:03:39,882 --> 01:03:41,317
Do not touch that!

1177
01:03:42,429 --> 01:03:43,625
Sorry Daddy.

1178
01:03:46,599 --> 01:03:49,395
I don't want anything.
Tell the university to take the lot.

1179
01:03:58,600 --> 01:03:59,893
The 12th Earl of Folgan

1180
01:03:59,918 --> 01:04:02,020
urgently requests
your presence at High Tea,

1181
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:03,772
this very moment.

1182
01:04:11,963 --> 01:04:12,915
Stop!

1183
01:04:20,657 --> 01:04:22,058
Move! Move!

1184
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:24,793
God! Sorry!

1185
01:04:26,929 --> 01:04:28,164
Ok, ok.

1186
01:04:33,069 --> 01:04:34,912
Oh please mademoiselle, don't do that.

1187
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:36,865
What?
Je m'appelle Hot Rod.

1188
01:04:36,890 --> 01:04:38,358
Christ alive, you are one of them!

1189
01:04:38,499 --> 01:04:41,225
Back! Be quiet!
Do not hit me again!

1190
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:51,087
So, which bloody bot are you, then?

1191
01:04:51,486 --> 01:04:53,407
Soundwave? Shockwave?

1192
01:04:53,432 --> 01:04:56,002
At least tell me that I have been
abducted by one of the famous ones.

1193
01:04:56,027 --> 01:04:58,088
I am so much better than all of them!

1194
01:04:58,113 --> 01:05:00,081
Oh! Help!
I am being kidnapped!

1195
01:05:00,283 --> 01:05:02,752
Mademoiselle, sit down!

1196
01:05:03,232 --> 01:05:05,640
Oh, help! Yes, yes, hello!

1197
01:05:05,665 --> 01:05:07,291
Hello, Lamborghini!

1198
01:05:07,876 --> 01:05:08,791
Would you help?

1199
01:05:09,594 --> 01:05:11,344
Sorry, I have just been kidnap...
Nuts!

1200
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:22,265
I love this car!

1201
01:05:37,030 --> 01:05:39,272
The White Cliffs of Dover.

1202
01:05:50,712 --> 01:05:53,215
That's a good girl.
Good girl.

1203
01:05:58,220 --> 01:06:00,483
Good girl. Come on.
There is a good girl.

1204
01:06:19,708 --> 01:06:20,869
We have guests!

1205
01:06:21,580 --> 01:06:22,954
What's the matter with you?

1206
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:24,736
Oh, shit!
My bits are falling off.

1207
01:06:24,761 --> 01:06:25,619
Idiot!

1208
01:06:26,573 --> 01:06:27,791
Hello there!

1209
01:06:28,962 --> 01:06:30,573
What the hell?

1210
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:33,689
Good girl.
Master, he is a complete knucklehead.

1211
01:06:33,813 --> 01:06:36,458
I am awfully sorry about that but...
you see...

1212
01:06:36,921 --> 01:06:38,357
he thinks it's still,

1213
01:06:38,381 --> 01:06:40,359
the year 1918 or 1914.

1214
01:06:40,383 --> 01:06:41,320
Something like that.

1215
01:06:41,515 --> 01:06:43,279
So sad.
World War I...

1216
01:06:43,303 --> 01:06:44,375
and all that stuff.

1217
01:06:44,766 --> 01:06:46,576
I mean... Battle of the Marne,
battle of the Somme,

1218
01:06:46,601 --> 01:06:48,304
battle of the Marne,
battle of Passchendaele.

1219
01:06:48,537 --> 01:06:50,763
Trenches and mud and death and...

1220
01:06:50,870 --> 01:06:52,794
gore and all that.
It's terribly sad.

1221
01:06:52,819 --> 01:06:55,221
It's a long way to Tipperary,
it's a long way to go.

1222
01:06:55,444 --> 01:06:57,747
Yeah, but it's... It's terrible!

1223
01:06:57,861 --> 01:07:00,497
I mean so sad, you know?
But then I mean...

1224
01:07:00,749 --> 01:07:03,419
Isn't it? I mean this late onset of...
well...

1225
01:07:04,386 --> 01:07:05,881
Robot dementia.

1226
01:07:06,183 --> 01:07:07,631
It's not at all pretty.

1227
01:07:09,705 --> 01:07:11,689
I don't know what you are smoking
in that pipe man, but...

1228
01:07:11,983 --> 01:07:13,181
What's going on here?

1229
01:07:13,795 --> 01:07:15,916
Did you drag me to some
Transformer retirement home?

1230
01:07:16,012 --> 01:07:17,924
Look, somebody better start talking
or I am out of here.

1231
01:07:18,512 --> 01:07:19,199
Ok.

1232
01:07:19,965 --> 01:07:21,003
Bumblebee?

1233
01:07:21,237 --> 01:07:23,652
We only met when I was
a little boy in short pants.

1234
01:07:23,777 --> 01:07:25,237
I must have been that tall.
Maybe taller.

1235
01:07:25,261 --> 01:07:26,753
Or maybe shorter, I can't remember.

1236
01:07:26,778 --> 01:07:28,300
But never forget a face.

1237
01:07:28,325 --> 01:07:29,534
Bee, you know this guy?

1238
01:07:29,559 --> 01:07:31,394
I don't... with you.
Oh, yes.

1239
01:07:31,780 --> 01:07:33,051
Let's have a look at this thing.

1240
01:07:33,325 --> 01:07:34,960
Please.
Very interesting.

1241
01:07:36,385 --> 01:07:37,176
Yes.

1242
01:07:38,787 --> 01:07:40,655
You keep a secret for so long,

1243
01:07:41,002 --> 01:07:43,792
knowing it to be true
and yet deep down inside,

1244
01:07:44,135 --> 01:07:45,581
you begin to wonder,

1245
01:07:46,661 --> 01:07:48,401
Has my life been wasted?

1246
01:07:49,793 --> 01:07:52,034
Have you ever felt like that, Mr. Cade?

1247
01:07:53,639 --> 01:07:55,075
It's just Cade.

1248
01:07:55,467 --> 01:07:58,437
Look, old timer, I don't have a ton
of patience for riddles right now.

1249
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:01,543
Yes, but you want to know
don't you dude...

1250
01:08:02,478 --> 01:08:04,146
why they keep coming here.

1251
01:08:04,546 --> 01:08:05,820
To Earth.

1252
01:08:06,624 --> 01:08:07,449
Right?

1253
01:08:10,791 --> 01:08:13,192
I do so love perfect timing.

1254
01:08:16,542 --> 01:08:18,511
What a bitching car she is!

1255
01:08:26,954 --> 01:08:28,071
No, no, no, little lady.

1256
01:08:28,096 --> 01:08:29,517
Why do you have to be like that?

1257
01:08:29,697 --> 01:08:31,002
<font color="#f4ff7a">Why?</font>
Get back!

1258
01:08:32,744 --> 01:08:34,679
So, is this a kidnapping sort of situation

1259
01:08:34,704 --> 01:08:36,486
or her first Transformer experience?

1260
01:08:36,798 --> 01:08:37,884
It's both, really.

1261
01:08:38,634 --> 01:08:40,142
Do not hit me again!

1262
01:08:40,349 --> 01:08:43,503
But she does have a rather
nice fight-or-flight response.

1263
01:08:44,234 --> 01:08:46,251
She is very difficult.

1264
01:08:48,357 --> 01:08:49,822
My name is Edmond Burton,

1265
01:08:49,846 --> 01:08:52,408
12th Earl of Folgan.
Last surviving member

1266
01:08:52,432 --> 01:08:54,237
of the Order of the Witwiccans.

1267
01:08:56,465 --> 01:08:57,499
What's up?

1268
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:06,172
Does he have to loom like that?

1269
01:09:06,267 --> 01:09:07,517
<font color="#f4ff7a">Hi darling.</font>

1270
01:09:08,399 --> 01:09:10,485
<font color="#f4ff7a">My name is Hot Rod.</font>

1271
01:09:10,735 --> 01:09:11,938
Ut what?

1272
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:13,259
Hot Rod!

1273
01:09:13,284 --> 01:09:15,165
Ut rut?
Hot Rod.

1274
01:09:15,451 --> 01:09:16,685
Hot Rod.

1275
01:09:17,386 --> 01:09:18,591
It's his French accent.

1276
01:09:18,740 --> 01:09:19,663
Is he French?

1277
01:09:19,688 --> 01:09:21,232
No, he just likes the accent.

1278
01:09:21,257 --> 01:09:23,397
No, no, no! I hate the accent!

1279
01:09:23,421 --> 01:09:24,994
But I can't get rid of it.

1280
01:09:25,107 --> 01:09:26,724
I am stuck with the accent.

1281
01:09:27,233 --> 01:09:28,761
He is a soldier, Miss Viviane.

1282
01:09:28,786 --> 01:09:31,333
He swore an oath to your father
to protect you.

1283
01:09:32,302 --> 01:09:33,700
Some dad you got there.

1284
01:09:33,935 --> 01:09:35,159
That is a nice ride, I mean,

1285
01:09:35,183 --> 01:09:37,206
you can roll right up
to Buckingham Palace in that thing.

1286
01:09:37,239 --> 01:09:39,770
Ok, you, American man, shut it.

1287
01:09:40,909 --> 01:09:42,244
What am I doing here?

1288
01:09:42,411 --> 01:09:44,715
Yeah, why is she here?
Introductions.

1289
01:09:45,514 --> 01:09:47,550
Miss Viviane Wembly.
Master of History, Oxford.

1290
01:09:47,575 --> 01:09:49,285
Doctor of Philosophy, also Oxford.

1291
01:09:49,318 --> 01:09:51,329
And Doctor of Letters,
again Oxford, I think.

1292
01:09:51,353 --> 01:09:53,589
Anything else?
Anyway meet Cade.

1293
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:55,748
Yeager.

1294
01:09:56,060 --> 01:09:58,029
Cade Yeager.
I am an inventor.

1295
01:09:58,227 --> 01:09:59,495
Oh, you are an inventor.

1296
01:09:59,528 --> 01:10:01,187
Yes, I am.
What have you invented?

1297
01:10:01,278 --> 01:10:03,180
A lot of things.
Like?

1298
01:10:04,302 --> 01:10:05,701
Like a lot of things. Like...

1299
01:10:06,103 --> 01:10:07,732
Things that you have heard of.
Like?

1300
01:10:08,098 --> 01:10:09,607
Well, things that
you will have heard of, ok?

1301
01:10:09,631 --> 01:10:10,704
Patents are pending.

1302
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:16,370
Don't say that.
What's ah?

1303
01:10:16,945 --> 01:10:18,536
You know, I could do that too.
Oh, I am English,

1304
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:19,654
and I am too cool for feelings.

1305
01:10:19,681 --> 01:10:21,101
What, I have come here to be insulted

1306
01:10:21,126 --> 01:10:23,907
by some over-educated ivory-tower
princess in a stripper dress?

1307
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:25,893
Stripper?
Well,

1308
01:10:26,018 --> 01:10:28,599
only in America is a finer education an insult.

1309
01:10:28,870 --> 01:10:30,610
And if my dress makes
you feel uncomfortable,

1310
01:10:30,635 --> 01:10:32,073
then maybe I could take it off.

1311
01:10:32,661 --> 01:10:33,494
Ok.

1312
01:10:34,408 --> 01:10:35,752
That's enough!

1313
01:10:36,428 --> 01:10:38,915
What's your problem?
No, no, no, no, no!

1314
01:10:39,535 --> 01:10:40,595
Cogman?

1315
01:10:41,178 --> 01:10:43,045
Shall I take his head off, madam?

1316
01:10:43,265 --> 01:10:44,687
Tempting but...

1317
01:10:44,850 --> 01:10:46,468
I can defend my own honor.

1318
01:10:46,777 --> 01:10:49,561
But I do so very much want
to crush his windpipe.

1319
01:10:50,779 --> 01:10:53,769
Control, Cogman.
You must learn to control that impulse.

1320
01:10:53,902 --> 01:10:55,551
Channel it into other things.

1321
01:10:56,523 --> 01:10:58,231
Yes, my lord.

1322
01:10:58,401 --> 01:11:02,371
Like making beds or cooking food.

1323
01:11:02,396 --> 01:11:04,456
Polishing the silver.

1324
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:06,633
I am trying, my lord.

1325
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:09,698
He is a Headmaster.
A very rare breed.

1326
01:11:10,203 --> 01:11:11,646
That dude is disturbed, yeah?

1327
01:11:11,733 --> 01:11:14,059
Like, seriously evil.
Like, split personality.

1328
01:11:14,331 --> 01:11:15,332
Good.

1329
01:11:16,255 --> 01:11:17,243
Cogman?

1330
01:11:17,267 --> 01:11:18,971
Glass 17C is missing.

1331
01:11:19,431 --> 01:11:20,295
Did you break it?

1332
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:22,808
I have been a butler
for the aristocracy for 700 years.

1333
01:11:22,833 --> 01:11:25,083
You are the worst
I have ever worked for!

1334
01:11:25,243 --> 01:11:27,069
These were all my predecessors.

1335
01:11:27,094 --> 01:11:29,602
They are all Folgans.
And that was my aunt there.

1336
01:11:29,651 --> 01:11:31,258
My great-great-great-great aunt.

1337
01:11:31,283 --> 01:11:33,258
She poisoned my great-great-great
uncle for some reason.

1338
01:11:33,283 --> 01:11:35,252
She was barking mad,
she was an absolute bitch.

1339
01:11:35,277 --> 01:11:37,373
There is my grandfather
over there, Aloysius.

1340
01:11:37,398 --> 01:11:39,266
And that's Arnold, my third cousin.

1341
01:11:39,395 --> 01:11:41,840
He drunk sewage water, committed suicide.
He was quite mad.

1342
01:11:41,865 --> 01:11:43,499
They were all mad, really.

1343
01:11:43,665 --> 01:11:45,063
There is bullet holes.

1344
01:11:47,227 --> 01:11:49,258
No, no. Nasty critter.

1345
01:11:49,283 --> 01:11:50,813
No, no, no, no, no.

1346
01:11:51,473 --> 01:11:53,964
That's the watch that killed Hitler.
Don't screw with it.

1347
01:11:55,425 --> 01:11:57,863
These are all the Witwiccans.

1348
01:11:58,251 --> 01:12:00,253
In our halcyon days
we were quite the club.

1349
01:12:00,425 --> 01:12:03,419
Brilliant minds, explorers,
scientists, artists, world leaders.

1350
01:12:03,652 --> 01:12:05,020
Renaissance thrill seekers.

1351
01:12:05,053 --> 01:12:06,439
People like Catherine the Great,

1352
01:12:06,463 --> 01:12:08,022
Empress of all Russia,
General Washington,

1353
01:12:08,047 --> 01:12:09,711
William Shakespeare,
Queen Elizabeth of England,

1354
01:12:09,736 --> 01:12:12,509
Abraham Lincoln, Frederick Douglass,
Harriet Tubman, the Wright Brothers,

1355
01:12:12,534 --> 01:12:14,125
Giotto, Michelangelo, Darwin,
Churchill, Einstein,

1356
01:12:14,150 --> 01:12:16,465
Stephen Hawking, Henry V,
Leonardo da Vinci,

1357
01:12:16,498 --> 01:12:18,734
Newton, de Lavoisier, Mozart,
Beethoven, Mahler,

1358
01:12:18,767 --> 01:12:21,370
Edmund Hillary,
Teddy Roosevelt, Copernicus,

1359
01:12:21,403 --> 01:12:22,871
Tesla, Galileo.

1360
01:12:23,107 --> 01:12:25,220
They all belonged to a secret society,
you see.

1361
01:12:25,269 --> 01:12:26,985
All united in one cause.

1362
01:12:27,376 --> 01:12:30,312
To protect the secret
history of Transformers.

1363
01:12:30,746 --> 01:12:32,922
Here. On Earth.

1364
01:12:33,815 --> 01:12:36,118
Now, this is the Witwiccan family tree.

1365
01:12:36,497 --> 01:12:38,079
Merlin, Viviana.

1366
01:12:38,572 --> 01:12:40,528
Goes back 40 generations.

1367
01:12:41,149 --> 01:12:43,318
Go over to that desk.
There is a photograph there.

1368
01:12:43,825 --> 01:12:45,442
Your father was a member.

1369
01:12:46,483 --> 01:12:48,224
He very much wanted to tell you that.

1370
01:12:50,766 --> 01:12:52,868
And my own family had some...

1371
01:12:55,671 --> 01:12:57,432
Small part in all this.

1372
01:12:58,707 --> 01:12:59,861
ZB-7.

1373
01:13:00,184 --> 01:13:01,485
That looks just like Bee.

1374
01:13:01,777 --> 01:13:04,158
It is. He was attached to the Devil's Brigade.

1375
01:13:04,220 --> 01:13:06,455
Pretty vicious military unit.

1376
01:13:06,715 --> 01:13:08,584
Helped turn the tide of war, you know?

1377
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:18,148
<font color="#f4ff7a">Invitation please?</font>

1378
01:13:20,079 --> 01:13:21,306
We are not invited.

1379
01:13:49,858 --> 01:13:50,892
Bee?
Yeah.

1380
01:13:51,136 --> 01:13:52,170
But he is so nice.

1381
01:13:52,361 --> 01:13:54,900
Behind the lines, during the war,
they called him many things.

1382
01:13:55,474 --> 01:13:57,064
Nice was never one of them.

1383
01:13:57,966 --> 01:14:01,216
It all began in 484 AD when King Arthur,

1384
01:14:01,442 --> 01:14:03,173
and his wizard Merlin,

1385
01:14:03,539 --> 01:14:06,356
stared down and vanquished
the Saxon hordes at Mount Badon.

1386
01:14:06,574 --> 01:14:08,664
That's his sword and his mace there.

1387
01:14:09,711 --> 01:14:10,785
It's a myth.

1388
01:14:11,179 --> 01:14:12,748
Yeah, every legend, every myth,

1389
01:14:12,781 --> 01:14:14,999
every story whispered around the campfire

1390
01:14:15,067 --> 01:14:16,769
has a logical explanation.

1391
01:14:16,952 --> 01:14:20,083
Oh, with that I agree wholeheartedly,
but logic has left the building.

1392
01:14:20,108 --> 01:14:21,615
You are talking about magic.

1393
01:14:21,757 --> 01:14:23,850
What, like your walking
talking Lamborghini?

1394
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:25,958
Any sufficiently advanced technology

1395
01:14:25,983 --> 01:14:27,522
is indistinguishable from magic.

1396
01:14:27,561 --> 01:14:29,529
Arthur C. Clarke.
Impressive.

1397
01:14:29,554 --> 01:14:30,746
Yeah and count them,

1398
01:14:30,967 --> 01:14:32,581
zero student loans, Doctor or...

1399
01:14:32,605 --> 01:14:34,866
Professor, Philosopher,
whatever you call yourself.

1400
01:14:35,069 --> 01:14:36,421
It's all of the above.

1401
01:14:42,404 --> 01:14:43,939
Now, this place was built

1402
01:14:44,780 --> 01:14:47,191
around the original Round Table.

1403
01:14:47,267 --> 01:14:50,437
Percival, Gawain, Tristan, Lancelot.

1404
01:14:54,690 --> 01:14:56,056
They sat right here.

1405
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:00,251
Twelve in all.

1406
01:15:00,862 --> 01:15:03,612
And behind them sat the 12
who came from...

1407
01:15:03,637 --> 01:15:05,095
Cybertron.

1408
01:15:10,872 --> 01:15:12,178
We fight for honor.

1409
01:15:13,742 --> 01:15:15,428
We fight for the human race.

1410
01:15:16,244 --> 01:15:17,874
For all that is good in mankind.

1411
01:15:18,630 --> 01:15:19,837
To brothers old...

1412
01:15:20,428 --> 01:15:21,666
and brothers new!

1413
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:24,717
To brothers old and brothers new!

1414
01:15:33,294 --> 01:15:34,893
No sacrifice,

1415
01:15:34,917 --> 01:15:36,598
no victory!

1416
01:15:36,865 --> 01:15:38,480
Twelve alien knights,

1417
01:15:38,981 --> 01:15:41,608
who saw in Camelot
what the human race could be...

1418
01:15:42,007 --> 01:15:43,137
at its finest.

1419
01:15:43,304 --> 01:15:44,551
A race of honor.

1420
01:15:55,009 --> 01:15:56,385
Cogman?
Hello?

1421
01:15:56,410 --> 01:15:57,784
You ruined the moment again.

1422
01:15:58,124 --> 01:16:00,734
I was making the moment more epic.

1423
01:16:01,022 --> 01:16:02,210
Just be quiet.

1424
01:16:02,658 --> 01:16:03,789
What's the matter with you?

1425
01:16:04,143 --> 01:16:05,968
If I could find his neck,
I would strangle him.

1426
01:16:06,828 --> 01:16:09,030
This belonged to King Arthur himself.

1427
01:16:10,065 --> 01:16:13,716
Now legend held that one last
knight would someday be chosen

1428
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:16,528
and the struggle to save
the world would begin.

1429
01:16:17,038 --> 01:16:19,040
It would appear, Mr. Cade,

1430
01:16:19,975 --> 01:16:21,356
that that last knight...

1431
01:16:22,145 --> 01:16:23,193
is you.

1432
01:16:25,104 --> 01:16:26,140
What?

1433
01:16:26,615 --> 01:16:28,592
You are saying he traveled
the whole universe to find me?

1434
01:16:28,617 --> 01:16:30,194
No, not you specifically. Not a...

1435
01:16:30,390 --> 01:16:33,093
failed inventor from the state of Texas.
No, God forbid.

1436
01:16:34,723 --> 01:16:35,724
Stop it!

1437
01:16:36,921 --> 01:16:37,826
What?

1438
01:16:38,727 --> 01:16:41,168
You know, if you don't stop it,
I will send you back to Cybertron

1439
01:16:41,192 --> 01:16:42,502
in a little tiny box.

1440
01:16:42,527 --> 01:16:43,628
Oh, scary.

1441
01:16:43,653 --> 01:16:45,151
I am not a failed inventor.

1442
01:16:45,366 --> 01:16:48,498
No he meant the,
qualities of a knight, Mr. Cade.

1443
01:16:49,337 --> 01:16:51,873
Miss Viviane, the qualities of a knight,
if you please?

1444
01:16:52,340 --> 01:16:53,785
Qualities of a knight, purity of heart,

1445
01:16:53,809 --> 01:16:55,754
valor, honor, virtue, integrity.

1446
01:16:56,223 --> 01:16:58,354
I have those.
Oh, and most importantly...

1447
01:16:58,379 --> 01:17:00,340
Is he chaste?
Chased?

1448
01:17:00,516 --> 01:17:02,193
Dude, I was getting chased
when your little weirdo buddy

1449
01:17:02,218 --> 01:17:03,538
brought me over here on the plane.

1450
01:17:04,232 --> 01:17:05,133
Chaste.

1451
01:17:05,386 --> 01:17:06,822
C-H-A-S-T-E.

1452
01:17:06,988 --> 01:17:07,890
T.

1453
01:17:08,157 --> 01:17:10,649
Celibate?
Yeah I know, I was making a joke.

1454
01:17:10,674 --> 01:17:11,918
You don't think I know how to spell?

1455
01:17:11,943 --> 01:17:13,446
I know what he meant.
Sure you were.

1456
01:17:13,712 --> 01:17:15,514
No whoopee Mr. Cade?

1457
01:17:16,832 --> 01:17:18,029
It's been a while.

1458
01:17:18,547 --> 01:17:21,150
Well, how long is a while?
A week? A month? A year?

1459
01:17:21,451 --> 01:17:22,724
None of your business.

1460
01:17:22,769 --> 01:17:24,470
Well, we need to ask you the question.

1461
01:17:25,373 --> 01:17:26,374
A while!

1462
01:17:28,425 --> 01:17:30,721
What is this?
Is that like another English thing?

1463
01:17:30,746 --> 01:17:31,843
No, no. Just a...

1464
01:17:32,144 --> 01:17:33,014
curious thing.

1465
01:17:33,048 --> 01:17:34,493
Well, maybe I am saving myself.

1466
01:17:34,518 --> 01:17:36,227
What are you saving yourself for, old age?

1467
01:17:36,401 --> 01:17:37,988
You, English lady, shut it.

1468
01:17:40,284 --> 01:17:42,353
What is this?
Some sort of a map?

1469
01:17:42,924 --> 01:17:44,794
Oh, this table is from Cybertron.

1470
01:17:44,819 --> 01:17:47,710
It's a puzzle I have been
working on for some time.

1471
01:17:47,836 --> 01:17:49,257
My entire life, actually.

1472
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:51,833
And what do these glyphs say about it?

1473
01:17:51,867 --> 01:17:53,187
They are Olde Cybertronian.

1474
01:17:53,935 --> 01:17:56,398
A mantra whispered through the cosmos.

1475
01:17:57,637 --> 01:17:59,421
Seglass Ni Tonday.

1476
01:17:59,867 --> 01:18:01,068
Wait a minute.

1477
01:18:01,777 --> 01:18:03,011
I heard that before.

1478
01:18:04,412 --> 01:18:05,709
A knight on a ship.

1479
01:18:05,923 --> 01:18:07,115
What does it mean?

1480
01:18:07,148 --> 01:18:08,463
With your dying breath,

1481
01:18:08,815 --> 01:18:10,158
protect the staff.

1482
01:18:11,186 --> 01:18:12,830
Ok, this is ridiculous.

1483
01:18:19,027 --> 01:18:20,462
They had their name for it.

1484
01:18:20,896 --> 01:18:22,063
We have ours.

1485
01:18:22,898 --> 01:18:24,132
The staff of Merlin.

1486
01:18:24,604 --> 01:18:26,690
Bequeathed to him by an alien race.

1487
01:18:26,843 --> 01:18:28,399
Fused with his DNA.

1488
01:18:28,894 --> 01:18:30,193
So that only he would...

1489
01:18:30,217 --> 01:18:32,664
have the key to unlock its alien power.

1490
01:18:33,842 --> 01:18:35,642
Or as they knew it in those days,

1491
01:18:36,778 --> 01:18:37,657
magic.

1492
01:18:40,048 --> 01:18:41,496
The staff was buried,

1493
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:43,228
with Merlin's body.

1494
01:18:43,919 --> 01:18:46,021
A thousand years we have kept it hidden.

1495
01:18:46,576 --> 01:18:49,100
If it ever fell into the wrong hands,
it would mean

1496
01:18:49,257 --> 01:18:51,923
the imminent destruction
of everything we know...

1497
01:18:52,522 --> 01:18:53,661
and love.

1498
01:18:53,929 --> 01:18:55,135
12 Guardian Knights,

1499
01:18:55,159 --> 01:18:56,887
combined into a mighty dragon,

1500
01:18:56,911 --> 01:18:58,033
to protect it.

1501
01:18:58,066 --> 01:18:59,858
And now it is in great danger.

1502
01:19:00,295 --> 01:19:01,224
Megatron.

1503
01:19:02,014 --> 01:19:03,013
He was after this.

1504
01:19:03,038 --> 01:19:04,619
So the battle is upon us.

1505
01:19:04,773 --> 01:19:06,483
It is why they are here,
why they keep coming to Earth.

1506
01:19:06,507 --> 01:19:09,177
And we must claim the staff
before it is too late.

1507
01:19:09,210 --> 01:19:10,812
Wait. We what?

1508
01:19:10,837 --> 01:19:13,377
Only a direct descendant of Merlin himself

1509
01:19:14,215 --> 01:19:16,859
can wield this instrument
of absolute power.

1510
01:19:17,726 --> 01:19:18,700
And you...

1511
01:19:19,023 --> 01:19:20,228
Miss Viviane,

1512
01:19:20,601 --> 01:19:22,652
are Merlin's last descendant here on Earth,

1513
01:19:22,676 --> 01:19:23,789
and as such, you...

1514
01:19:24,211 --> 01:19:25,405
are our last hope.

1515
01:19:25,922 --> 01:19:26,708
Ok, wait.

1516
01:19:26,905 --> 01:19:29,741
Go back. You are saying that I am
related to the wizard Merlin?

1517
01:19:36,007 --> 01:19:37,272
Bit of a shock, isn't it?

1518
01:19:38,506 --> 01:19:40,615
Only you know the staff's location,

1519
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:42,622
imparted to you by your father.

1520
01:19:42,878 --> 01:19:45,113
He had to leave a clue, didn't he?

1521
01:19:45,814 --> 01:19:46,795
Are you sure?

1522
01:19:46,964 --> 01:19:48,942
She doesn't have that
I know where the staff is look.

1523
01:19:49,084 --> 01:19:51,953
Listen, the only thing
that my father imparted to me

1524
01:19:51,987 --> 01:19:53,488
was to get out of his study.

1525
01:19:53,521 --> 01:19:55,891
Two worlds colliding, only one survives.

1526
01:19:56,124 --> 01:19:57,447
Your words exactly.

1527
01:19:57,674 --> 01:19:59,127
Only lecture time is over.

1528
01:19:59,327 --> 01:20:01,320
You were born for this.

1529
01:20:02,230 --> 01:20:04,663
This is the latest image
of their world coming here.

1530
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,002
And you are all that stand in its way.

1531
01:20:07,235 --> 01:20:09,070
So you'd better find that staff quickly.

1532
01:20:09,104 --> 01:20:10,104
Now!

1533
01:20:10,878 --> 01:20:11,739
TRF.

1534
01:20:11,764 --> 01:20:13,497
Surround the castle and lock it down.

1535
01:20:16,907 --> 01:20:18,970
MI6 and TRF are here!

1536
01:20:19,347 --> 01:20:20,876
Move it! Go!

1537
01:20:21,216 --> 01:20:23,259
Cogman, get me to London, ok?

1538
01:20:26,988 --> 01:20:28,790
The decoy car is ready?
Hurry along.

1539
01:20:31,292 --> 01:20:33,294
I got them boys!

1540
01:20:37,232 --> 01:20:39,114
Hurry, move!
Quick, quick, quick!

1541
01:20:40,568 --> 01:20:41,864
Get us out of here, Bee.

1542
01:20:42,934 --> 01:20:45,560
Get out of here!
My weapon will stop the time!

1543
01:20:59,674 --> 01:21:02,643
Einstein would have been
tickled pink. Foo-Foo!

1544
01:21:05,306 --> 01:21:07,237
Quick, this way, this way! Hurry!

1545
01:21:07,871 --> 01:21:09,973
Shotgun.
I call shotgun.

1546
01:21:18,606 --> 01:21:20,715
<i>Inbound helos, you are clear to land.</i>

1547
01:21:22,006 --> 01:21:23,607
<i>Colonel Lennox just hit the deck.</i>

1548
01:21:25,723 --> 01:21:27,983
This is Santos, Team Leader USA.
What you got?

1549
01:21:31,319 --> 01:21:33,219
<i>TRF airship on the way.</i>

1550
01:21:41,096 --> 01:21:42,230
Meet me around back, Bee.

1551
01:21:44,365 --> 01:21:46,067
I suck at this game!

1552
01:21:46,101 --> 01:21:48,103
When you bite your nails,
you give everything away.

1553
01:21:48,165 --> 01:21:49,134
Mum?

1554
01:21:50,438 --> 01:21:51,770
Everybody.

1555
01:21:52,125 --> 01:21:54,906
This is Cade.
Cade, this is my family.

1556
01:21:55,376 --> 01:21:56,611
Hello!

1557
01:21:56,644 --> 01:21:58,193
Hi.
Cade?

1558
01:21:58,218 --> 01:21:59,881
Hello. I am Marie.

1559
01:21:59,915 --> 01:22:01,155
Do you have a dungeon?

1560
01:22:01,182 --> 01:22:03,218
Oh, my goodness!
Hands like rough old maple.

1561
01:22:03,251 --> 01:22:04,672
He looks hard as wood.

1562
01:22:04,697 --> 01:22:07,149
Don't touch him.
I am gonna go and get changed.

1563
01:22:07,174 --> 01:22:10,524
I got a call from a very irate
janitor at Trinity Library.

1564
01:22:11,226 --> 01:22:12,227
<i>You are late.</i>

1565
01:22:12,510 --> 01:22:14,295
<i>We are as they say, in a bit of a pickle.</i>

1566
01:22:14,329 --> 01:22:15,897
Do not mess with me at this moment!

1567
01:22:15,931 --> 01:22:18,133
It's hot, and I am on a short fuse.

1568
01:22:21,943 --> 01:22:23,313
Quick!
Get to the library!

1569
01:22:23,338 --> 01:22:24,973
This chasing is stressing me out.

1570
01:22:28,748 --> 01:22:30,950
MI6 and TRF are gonna find us.
We got to hurry.

1571
01:22:31,479 --> 01:22:33,214
My dad had a lot of stuff.

1572
01:22:34,829 --> 01:22:36,452
So, finding the staff's location.

1573
01:22:36,477 --> 01:22:37,977
What does that mean?
We are looking for, like what?

1574
01:22:38,002 --> 01:22:39,969
Like a map or a letter or books or...

1575
01:22:39,994 --> 01:22:43,024
Holy shit! It will take a year
to find something in here.

1576
01:22:43,049 --> 01:22:45,251
I don't know where to find this bloody staff.

1577
01:22:45,393 --> 01:22:46,729
Look at this little fake horse.

1578
01:22:47,028 --> 01:22:49,635
Probably stuffed in its butt or something.
Guys do stupid stuff like that.

1579
01:22:51,299 --> 01:22:53,001
What is going on up there?

1580
01:22:54,235 --> 01:22:56,972
You checking behind pictures?
Just rip it. Rip it apart!

1581
01:22:57,973 --> 01:22:59,695
Just grab it. Hurry, let's make this quick.

1582
01:22:59,724 --> 01:23:01,756
This is exciting.
I can't get it out.

1583
01:23:02,624 --> 01:23:03,486
Great.

1584
01:23:03,675 --> 01:23:06,578
Oh, my God.
Such a hoarder.

1585
01:23:09,235 --> 01:23:11,003
It's like having Tarzan in the house.

1586
01:23:11,186 --> 01:23:12,353
Slow down.

1587
01:23:13,764 --> 01:23:15,493
I am gonna take a peek.
No!

1588
01:23:16,224 --> 01:23:18,162
Come on, come on.
Answer me, come on!

1589
01:23:20,893 --> 01:23:22,409
<i>Damn you, tell me where it is!</i>

1590
01:23:22,597 --> 01:23:25,182
Not so fast. I want in.

1591
01:23:26,552 --> 01:23:28,788
To be a Witwiccan,
you have to be a special person.

1592
01:23:28,886 --> 01:23:30,050
You sir, are not.

1593
01:23:30,112 --> 01:23:31,703
Read me into the club and I will tell you.

1594
01:23:31,727 --> 01:23:32,875
Right here, now.

1595
01:23:33,008 --> 01:23:35,992
Over the phone that is...
absolutely barbaric.

1596
01:23:36,111 --> 01:23:37,979
Over the phone, do it Englishman!

1597
01:23:38,213 --> 01:23:39,753
As the 12th Earl of Folgan,

1598
01:23:40,093 --> 01:23:42,483
by the power imbued
by His Majesty King Arthur

1599
01:23:42,754 --> 01:23:44,543
and his League of Knights
of the Round Table,

1600
01:23:44,645 --> 01:23:46,968
<i>I now grant you,
Seymour Rutherford Simmons.</i>

1601
01:23:46,992 --> 01:23:47,969
Entrance into...

1602
01:23:47,993 --> 01:23:49,526
Admittance, not entrance!

1603
01:23:49,551 --> 01:23:50,934
Don't try to snooker me.
Get it right.

1604
01:23:50,959 --> 01:23:53,707
Enough, enough, enough.
Just tell me! Now!

1605
01:23:54,611 --> 01:23:55,643
Shut up!

1606
01:23:56,107 --> 01:23:57,318
Yourselves...

1607
01:23:58,133 --> 01:23:59,467
What's the matter with you all?

1608
01:23:59,891 --> 01:24:00,851
Stack six, row C.

1609
01:24:01,179 --> 01:24:02,859
Hurry, man, they are dissolving scrotums.

1610
01:24:02,883 --> 01:24:04,235
Let's go.
I am going! I am going!

1611
01:24:04,259 --> 01:24:05,638
It's very confusing talking to you.

1612
01:24:05,663 --> 01:24:06,766
Come on, old man, get there!

1613
01:24:06,791 --> 01:24:08,489
Come on Simmons,
you said no work today.

1614
01:24:08,514 --> 01:24:10,844
Let's get your pale-ass legs
and go to the beach.

1615
01:24:10,869 --> 01:24:12,118
I am working here, alright?

1616
01:24:12,142 --> 01:24:13,392
Five minutes, I swear!

1617
01:24:13,486 --> 01:24:15,783
You always say five minutes.
That means no.

1618
01:24:15,816 --> 01:24:18,503
Just go get Rodrigo and Julio
and get the game started.

1619
01:24:18,528 --> 01:24:19,918
I hate Rodrigo.

1620
01:24:19,943 --> 01:24:21,261
I will set and bump
with you in 10 minutes.

1621
01:24:21,286 --> 01:24:22,420
Ok, come on.

1622
01:24:22,444 --> 01:24:23,934
I am in the middle of something.
Ok, back.

1623
01:24:23,959 --> 01:24:27,543
<i>They knew way back in the Dark
Ages where the end would begin.</i>

1624
01:24:27,996 --> 01:24:29,957
There is Cybertron and there is Earth.

1625
01:24:30,132 --> 01:24:31,987
Only they don't call it Earth at all,
they never did.

1626
01:24:32,012 --> 01:24:34,839
<i>They called it something else.
One will suck the other dry,</i>

1627
01:24:34,965 --> 01:24:37,968
a giant succubus, until only one remains.

1628
01:24:41,142 --> 01:24:42,853
Earth is Unicron.

1629
01:24:42,878 --> 01:24:46,478
One day his horns will rise to
fight the mad goddess Quintessa.

1630
01:24:47,759 --> 01:24:50,712
She will end our planet
to resurrect her own.

1631
01:24:51,519 --> 01:24:52,671
Let's go. Hurry!

1632
01:24:52,696 --> 01:24:54,064
Oh, my lord.
Cogman go!

1633
01:24:54,089 --> 01:24:55,460
<i>Tell me where it goes down.</i>

1634
01:24:55,485 --> 01:24:56,791
<i>I just Dropped it to you.</i>

1635
01:24:56,824 --> 01:24:58,933
<i>The horns are the key to the location.</i>

1636
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:01,209
<i>Why are they spread out
all over the Earth in a jumble?</i>

1637
01:25:01,233 --> 01:25:02,130
<i>The answer, they are not.</i>

1638
01:25:02,163 --> 01:25:03,336
Time and Mother Nature,

1639
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:04,540
pulled them apart.

1640
01:25:04,565 --> 01:25:06,243
That's Pangaea.
The super continent.

1641
01:25:06,267 --> 01:25:08,014
It's the same shape on the Round Table.

1642
01:25:08,039 --> 01:25:09,240
Take a gander Folgers,

1643
01:25:09,271 --> 01:25:12,093
at what's smack in the center
of that perfect circle.

1644
01:25:12,473 --> 01:25:13,475
Genius!

1645
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:14,749
That's Stonehenge!

1646
01:25:14,774 --> 01:25:16,522
One of the greatest mysteries of the ages.

1647
01:25:16,547 --> 01:25:18,416
No one understood its purpose until now.

1648
01:25:18,441 --> 01:25:20,103
No one. Except me.

1649
01:25:20,281 --> 01:25:21,299
That's where it all begins.

1650
01:25:21,324 --> 01:25:23,326
You are the man behind the man.
Do something.

1651
01:25:23,351 --> 01:25:25,153
<i>I will handle it,
Brother Simmons, fear not.</i>

1652
01:25:25,186 --> 01:25:26,390
I never had a brother.

1653
01:25:28,256 --> 01:25:29,320
Feels nice.

1654
01:25:29,590 --> 01:25:31,182
Beach time!
Ready?

1655
01:25:36,197 --> 01:25:37,598
Viviane followed Merlin.

1656
01:25:38,899 --> 01:25:40,001
What does that mean?

1657
01:25:40,747 --> 01:25:42,023
My secret cupboard!

1658
01:25:47,142 --> 01:25:48,062
Ok, ok.

1659
01:25:48,476 --> 01:25:50,077
Viviane followed Merlin.

1660
01:25:50,211 --> 01:25:51,426
<i>Only Merlin,</i>

1661
01:25:51,575 --> 01:25:53,339
<i>could wield the magic staff.</i>

1662
01:25:54,089 --> 01:25:56,025
<i>Merlin and little girls, of course.</i>

1663
01:26:00,555 --> 01:26:02,857
Navy Museum, that's got
to be where the staff is.

1664
01:26:02,890 --> 01:26:04,666
Oh, my God, It was in my hands all along.

1665
01:26:08,563 --> 01:26:09,953
Alpha team, go, go, go.

1666
01:26:10,982 --> 01:26:13,018
British TRF!
Come on!

1667
01:26:14,569 --> 01:26:15,636
I surrender.

1668
01:26:16,937 --> 01:26:19,101
My lord, TRF is on our tail.

1669
01:26:19,674 --> 01:26:21,871
Why would you park
the decoy car so far away?

1670
01:26:21,896 --> 01:26:23,431
Oh, you are a fusspot!

1671
01:26:24,479 --> 01:26:26,447
Good. Don't let us get caught, Cogman.

1672
01:26:27,615 --> 01:26:29,350
My speciality my lord.

1673
01:26:47,502 --> 01:26:49,337
Damn! You don't have to kill people.

1674
01:26:55,943 --> 01:26:57,278
Get out of the way!

1675
01:27:00,448 --> 01:27:02,429
Which reminds me, Agnes called.

1676
01:27:02,454 --> 01:27:05,286
Wondered if you are available for
a bit of a snuggle this evening.

1677
01:27:05,686 --> 01:27:08,189
Oh, I would love a snuggle with Agnes.
Do I look available?

1678
01:27:18,966 --> 01:27:20,711
Move, bitch! Get out of my way!
Kamikaze pilot!

1679
01:27:20,735 --> 01:27:22,470
Move, bitch!
Get out of my way!

1680
01:27:23,971 --> 01:27:24,982
Hello. Yes.

1681
01:27:25,006 --> 01:27:26,096
Navy Museum.

1682
01:27:27,642 --> 01:27:29,596
Royal Navy Museum.
I knew it!

1683
01:27:34,831 --> 01:27:36,433
Bee, I am gonna divert the cops!

1684
01:27:39,754 --> 01:27:42,144
A Decepticon has been seen...
What do you mean Decepticon?

1685
01:27:44,325 --> 01:27:46,441
Here is where it gets intense.
More intense?

1686
01:27:58,473 --> 01:27:59,337
Bee?

1687
01:28:06,435 --> 01:28:07,886
Goddamn, they are all around us

1688
01:28:07,911 --> 01:28:09,780
and I just have so much road rage!

1689
01:28:10,017 --> 01:28:11,619
Actualize the rage.
That's it!

1690
01:28:13,488 --> 01:28:15,173
Oh, you want some?

1691
01:28:17,558 --> 01:28:19,181
Cogman, blast them!

1692
01:28:31,639 --> 01:28:32,640
Good boy.

1693
01:28:35,443 --> 01:28:37,078
It's a one-way street!

1694
01:28:37,103 --> 01:28:38,576
I am not driving.
He I's driving.

1695
01:28:40,972 --> 01:28:41,832
No!

1696
01:28:47,087 --> 01:28:48,746
Bee, head right, haul ass!
Go!

1697
01:29:03,921 --> 01:29:05,749
That's how you get to the big leagues.

1698
01:29:08,509 --> 01:29:09,810
Oh, that hurt.

1699
01:29:10,468 --> 01:29:11,709
What the hell?

1700
01:29:11,904 --> 01:29:13,442
You are out of your mind!

1701
01:29:18,089 --> 01:29:20,089
Did we lose them?
Hey, stop! You didn't pay!

1702
01:29:20,114 --> 01:29:21,805
Sorry.
It's alright, I have got them!

1703
01:29:21,829 --> 01:29:23,424
They just love submarines.

1704
01:29:25,626 --> 01:29:26,761
They are a bit rude.

1705
01:29:26,794 --> 01:29:29,034
Yes, they are, are not they?
That's the modern generation.

1706
01:29:29,201 --> 01:29:31,062
And this museum is closed...

1707
01:29:31,377 --> 01:29:32,528
for eternity.

1708
01:29:32,553 --> 01:29:34,744
All you boys and girls, off the sub now!

1709
01:29:34,769 --> 01:29:36,351
Off the sub now!

1710
01:29:36,375 --> 01:29:37,572
Move, move, move!

1711
01:29:37,605 --> 01:29:40,065
Go on, push! Move your fat ass!
Push! Squeeze!

1712
01:29:40,144 --> 01:29:41,323
Go, go, go!

1713
01:29:41,842 --> 01:29:43,544
This thing isn't gonna run.

1714
01:29:43,811 --> 01:29:44,992
The mission is...

1715
01:29:45,529 --> 01:29:47,815
in deep unexplored waters.

1716
01:29:48,515 --> 01:29:49,716
It's wonderful!

1717
01:29:49,786 --> 01:29:52,656
And the sour-sweet musk
of men in close quarters.

1718
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:54,655
It's quite disgusting, really.

1719
01:29:54,822 --> 01:29:56,167
But now this...

1720
01:29:56,491 --> 01:29:58,213
the greatest mission of them all,

1721
01:29:58,310 --> 01:30:00,646
one that I have longed for my entire life...

1722
01:30:01,269 --> 01:30:02,927
To help turn the tide of...

1723
01:30:03,857 --> 01:30:05,614
human history, you know?

1724
01:30:08,641 --> 01:30:10,061
Now alas...

1725
01:30:11,572 --> 01:30:13,340
I can no longer join you.

1726
01:30:14,635 --> 01:30:17,653
But, my lord, you have been
waiting for this moment for 71 years.

1727
01:30:17,678 --> 01:30:20,681
I know, I know, but I am not
knighthood material, I am afraid.

1728
01:30:21,113 --> 01:30:22,449
And...

1729
01:30:22,783 --> 01:30:24,547
You have your mission and I have mine.

1730
01:30:24,572 --> 01:30:27,281
Oh, no, no.
You are not leaving us in this tin can

1731
01:30:27,306 --> 01:30:29,418
with that four-foot mental psychopath.
I don't think so.

1732
01:30:29,443 --> 01:30:31,512
I prefer the word sociopath.

1733
01:30:31,759 --> 01:30:34,235
Mr. Cade, everything
you have done in your life, your...

1734
01:30:34,719 --> 01:30:37,044
pain and your suffering,
the loss of your wife,

1735
01:30:37,068 --> 01:30:39,704
separation from your daughter,
your financial difficulties,

1736
01:30:39,813 --> 01:30:43,492
it's all just been a journey
to this very moment.

1737
01:30:46,507 --> 01:30:47,742
You talk a lot.

1738
01:30:49,209 --> 01:30:50,576
Yeah, I suppose I do.

1739
01:30:52,447 --> 01:30:53,654
My dear,

1740
01:30:54,865 --> 01:30:57,185
your father left the Alliance to you,

1741
01:30:57,652 --> 01:30:58,886
for you alone.

1742
01:30:58,919 --> 01:31:00,788
She knows the way to the staff.

1743
01:31:01,188 --> 01:31:02,475
Good luck to both of you.

1744
01:31:04,224 --> 01:31:06,527
It won't be the strangest
thing I have done today.

1745
01:31:10,357 --> 01:31:12,263
Hope the old girl's still got it.

1746
01:31:19,239 --> 01:31:20,575
Good luck!

1747
01:31:25,245 --> 01:31:26,881
Ok. I didn't do that.

1748
01:31:27,969 --> 01:31:29,225
Jumped?
What do you mean, jumped?

1749
01:31:29,249 --> 01:31:31,396
The old World War II sub
jumped its moorings.

1750
01:31:31,421 --> 01:31:32,855
They are in a Transformer.

1751
01:31:42,830 --> 01:31:44,765
Can I get a look?
No, I am looking.

1752
01:31:44,799 --> 01:31:46,233
Will you move?

1753
01:31:46,266 --> 01:31:48,150
God, get out of the way, man!
Is that water?

1754
01:31:48,175 --> 01:31:50,611
No shit, Sherlock.
Obviously, it's water.

1755
01:31:50,705 --> 01:31:52,471
Do you know how to operate it?
You know how to operate it, right?

1756
01:31:52,496 --> 01:31:54,621
He says you are in charge of this now.

1757
01:31:54,817 --> 01:31:56,819
Let me see. Let me see.
Don't touch me again!

1758
01:31:56,844 --> 01:31:58,045
Don't freak me out.

1759
01:31:58,078 --> 01:32:00,790
What happens in the alien
ship stays in the alien ship.

1760
01:32:00,815 --> 01:32:02,619
I will eff you up!

1761
01:32:04,251 --> 01:32:06,485
<i>Zero surface, I have positive surface contact.</i>

1762
01:32:06,510 --> 01:32:07,905
<i>Track number 5205.</i>

1763
01:32:07,930 --> 01:32:10,547
The sub must be heading for open water,
directly towards our strike group.

1764
01:32:10,572 --> 01:32:11,960
Ok, we have to cut them off. Stop them.

1765
01:32:11,985 --> 01:32:13,233
Use whatever assets we have.

1766
01:32:13,258 --> 01:32:14,495
Contact the Zulu module.

1767
01:32:14,529 --> 01:32:16,329
Have all our subs
converge on that choke point.

1768
01:32:16,354 --> 01:32:18,323
<i>Helm, all ahead flank.</i>

1769
01:32:20,034 --> 01:32:21,674
Conn, Sonar. Alien contact,

1770
01:32:21,702 --> 01:32:23,704
bearing 150, range 1,000 yards.

1771
01:32:23,738 --> 01:32:25,606
Contact bearing 150.

1772
01:32:31,011 --> 01:32:33,888
We need to get SEAL teams in DSVs.
We need to chase them.

1773
01:32:37,885 --> 01:32:39,286
Control. Ace One, going to the bay.

1774
01:32:39,319 --> 01:32:40,736
Ace One, going to the bay.

1775
01:32:53,303 --> 01:32:55,013
Cogman?
Is that normal?

1776
01:32:55,038 --> 01:32:56,249
Perfectly normal, ma'am.

1777
01:32:56,326 --> 01:32:58,551
A nuclear-class attack
submarine is on our stern.

1778
01:32:58,576 --> 01:33:00,334
What?
Quick, follow me. Quick.

1779
01:33:00,675 --> 01:33:02,224
It's your sub, not mine.

1780
01:33:02,435 --> 01:33:05,780
My sub? Seven hours ago,
I was just a professor.

1781
01:33:09,884 --> 01:33:11,158
Alright, uncoupling.

1782
01:33:20,628 --> 01:33:21,709
Alright, let's move.

1783
01:33:22,123 --> 01:33:23,440
Let's move.
Put it in high gear.

1784
01:33:27,137 --> 01:33:28,739
DSV-2, stay on our tail.

1785
01:33:29,807 --> 01:33:32,510
Conn, Sonar.
Alien contact, 1,000 yards and closing.

1786
01:33:32,535 --> 01:33:34,211
An alarm on a sub is not a good thing.

1787
01:33:34,236 --> 01:33:35,643
Why did he send us up here?

1788
01:33:35,676 --> 01:33:36,987
He got us up front so we die first.

1789
01:33:37,011 --> 01:33:38,054
Let's let them know we are here.

1790
01:33:38,078 --> 01:33:40,118
Warning shot. Make tube one
ready in all respects.

1791
01:33:40,143 --> 01:33:41,401
Shoot tube one.

1792
01:33:50,143 --> 01:33:52,463
Conn, Sonar.
Alien contact going vertical.

1793
01:34:02,837 --> 01:34:03,938
Hold on!

1794
01:34:12,112 --> 01:34:13,748
Conn, Sonar.
It's coming back around.

1795
01:34:13,781 --> 01:34:15,650
It's gonna hit us!
Brace for impact!

1796
01:34:16,851 --> 01:34:17,918
Hold on!

1797
01:34:24,992 --> 01:34:26,632
Conn, Sonar.
He is going deep!

1798
01:34:27,835 --> 01:34:29,985
We are clear for now.
Hands off!

1799
01:34:30,140 --> 01:34:32,166
There is a time
and a place for everything.

1800
01:34:32,199 --> 01:34:34,550
This is not the time, nor the place.

1801
01:34:35,135 --> 01:34:36,503
Hey!
Not now!

1802
01:34:36,528 --> 01:34:38,697
Where are you going?
Away from here.

1803
01:34:42,966 --> 01:34:45,234
That little sicko just shot
himself out like a torpedo!

1804
01:34:45,259 --> 01:34:46,981
I know! I saw it!

1805
01:34:47,014 --> 01:34:48,353
Those are your peoples.

1806
01:34:56,023 --> 01:34:57,096
Good afternoon.

1807
01:34:57,874 --> 01:34:59,312
Is the, Prime Minister in?

1808
01:34:59,763 --> 01:35:00,687
Who?

1809
01:35:01,116 --> 01:35:03,124
The Prime Minister, who else?
It's very urgent.

1810
01:35:03,274 --> 01:35:05,336
Oh, it's urgent, is it?
Why didn't you say so?

1811
01:35:06,767 --> 01:35:08,102
Thank you.
Dickhead.

1812
01:35:08,135 --> 01:35:09,955
I will use the old entrance.
Good afternoon.

1813
01:35:10,706 --> 01:35:11,940
Get in there.

1814
01:35:22,750 --> 01:35:23,801
Oh, my... Sorry.

1815
01:35:23,833 --> 01:35:26,150
Oh, I just got this thing that
was on my arm and it's like,

1816
01:35:26,174 --> 01:35:27,805
just moving all around.
Yeah.

1817
01:35:27,829 --> 01:35:30,045
It's-It's-It-It seems to not be...

1818
01:35:30,069 --> 01:35:31,298
If you would...

1819
01:35:31,926 --> 01:35:33,938
It's just sort of slithery...

1820
01:35:34,962 --> 01:35:36,618
Slipping from the arm to the...

1821
01:35:36,643 --> 01:35:38,473
Yeah, it's coming down.
It's going down your pants there.

1822
01:35:38,498 --> 01:35:39,360
Careful.

1823
01:35:39,849 --> 01:35:40,848
And is it...

1824
01:35:40,872 --> 01:35:43,096
tight or gripping on?
It doesn't hurt but...

1825
01:35:43,120 --> 01:35:45,381
I don't know what it does.
It's like some worthless alien junk.

1826
01:35:45,406 --> 01:35:46,975
I think the purpose...
I think the...

1827
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:48,702
We will find out what the purpose is.

1828
01:35:48,727 --> 01:35:50,110
If... If you want to.

1829
01:35:52,759 --> 01:35:55,528
Cogman! What is...
What is all this?

1830
01:35:55,553 --> 01:35:56,642
End of the world.

1831
01:35:56,667 --> 01:35:57,531
I thought a meal,

1832
01:35:57,555 --> 01:35:59,803
a last meal, would be in order.

1833
01:36:00,087 --> 01:36:02,256
Great. I am starving.
No canoodling.

1834
01:36:02,923 --> 01:36:03,924
Wait, Cogman?

1835
01:36:06,896 --> 01:36:08,458
Yep. My daughter would...
So my grandma said...

1836
01:36:08,829 --> 01:36:10,849
My grandma would absolutely...
My daughter would love this.

1837
01:36:10,935 --> 01:36:12,361
Yeah, I was about to say same thing.
She keeps saying,

1838
01:36:12,385 --> 01:36:13,687
She would love it.
I have got to move on.

1839
01:36:13,712 --> 01:36:15,179
No. Yes, all the time!
Really?

1840
01:36:15,204 --> 01:36:16,163
Please.
What does she say?

1841
01:36:16,188 --> 01:36:18,317
Go on a date, get a boyfriend.
Is this a date?

1842
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:20,868
No. God, it's not a date.

1843
01:36:20,892 --> 01:36:22,993
No. It's-It's just that...
It's romantic.

1844
01:36:25,079 --> 01:36:27,147
Sushi a la Cogman!

1845
01:36:28,125 --> 01:36:29,192
Looks great.

1846
01:36:36,090 --> 01:36:37,519
No sacrifice,

1847
01:36:37,858 --> 01:36:39,034
no victory.

1848
01:36:42,863 --> 01:36:44,965
Is the President in his bunker?

1849
01:36:45,299 --> 01:36:46,399
He is.

1850
01:36:46,967 --> 01:36:48,094
How about Putin?

1851
01:36:49,717 --> 01:36:50,918
Son of a bitch.

1852
01:36:55,075 --> 01:36:56,543
Are you the new Prime Minister?

1853
01:36:56,576 --> 01:36:58,499
Security, my office now!

1854
01:36:58,625 --> 01:37:00,693
Oh, I am sorry. Well, I used the old entrance.

1855
01:37:00,719 --> 01:37:03,121
That door is used for
extraordinary circumstances,

1856
01:37:03,217 --> 01:37:05,512
and these circumstances
are quite extraordinary.

1857
01:37:05,886 --> 01:37:07,676
I will keep this very simple.

1858
01:37:08,088 --> 01:37:10,563
Nasty little fellow.
I let him out,

1859
01:37:10,595 --> 01:37:12,385
we all die terrible deaths.

1860
01:37:12,410 --> 01:37:13,894
Do you understand?

1861
01:37:15,029 --> 01:37:15,993
Thank you.

1862
01:37:16,312 --> 01:37:18,281
Now, my name is Sir Edmond Burton,

1863
01:37:18,306 --> 01:37:20,837
Her Majesty's Royal Navy,
Order of the Witwiccans,

1864
01:37:20,862 --> 01:37:23,821
keeper of the secret history of
Transformers here on Earth...

1865
01:37:23,846 --> 01:37:25,814
Witwiccans?
Witwiccans, yes.

1866
01:37:27,908 --> 01:37:29,844
But... they all died out.

1867
01:37:29,950 --> 01:37:31,375
Not all of them.

1868
01:37:31,795 --> 01:37:33,219
Not yet anyway.

1869
01:37:33,347 --> 01:37:35,883
But I do need you to marshal
all your resources...

1870
01:37:35,916 --> 01:37:37,469
Hold on. You have just...
Best shut up.

1871
01:37:37,494 --> 01:37:39,329
Emerged from the wall and now...
Let me finish. Let me...

1872
01:37:39,353 --> 01:37:40,688
Shut up!

1873
01:37:44,158 --> 01:37:46,260
Shut up.

1874
01:37:48,062 --> 01:37:51,186
Ok. As I said, I need you to marshal
all your resources,

1875
01:37:51,210 --> 01:37:52,690
all your military assets.

1876
01:37:52,715 --> 01:37:55,004
Because as you no doubt have surmised,

1877
01:37:55,036 --> 01:37:56,704
the world is going to end,

1878
01:37:56,883 --> 01:37:59,223
and I know where. And when.

1879
01:38:06,246 --> 01:38:10,084
You are the first to see this
ship since the Dark Ages.

1880
01:38:10,284 --> 01:38:14,436
Your talisman is the key
to unlocking this ship.

1881
01:38:28,503 --> 01:38:30,746
Sonar has about 800 meters.

1882
01:38:33,107 --> 01:38:35,246
I think I got a bogey at four o'clock.

1883
01:38:35,784 --> 01:38:37,684
<i>We are starting to see it through the murk.</i>

1884
01:38:39,679 --> 01:38:40,996
There is lights down here.

1885
01:38:42,983 --> 01:38:45,886
Oh, my God. Look at that.
It's a big alien ship.

1886
01:38:46,220 --> 01:38:49,189
<i>Topside, are you catching this?
It's massive.</i>

1887
01:38:55,359 --> 01:38:56,546
The ship knows we are here.

1888
01:39:12,947 --> 01:39:14,014
Stay on his tail.

1889
01:39:19,019 --> 01:39:20,020
Oh, shit.

1890
01:39:25,059 --> 01:39:26,584
<i>The door just sealed.</i>

1891
01:39:28,553 --> 01:39:29,748
Try those tubes.

1892
01:39:30,364 --> 01:39:32,299
DSV-2, stay close.
Stay close.

1893
01:39:33,033 --> 01:39:34,234
<i>Topside, we are going in.</i>

1894
01:39:35,069 --> 01:39:36,653
We are gonna lose radio contact.

1895
01:39:47,747 --> 01:39:48,877
We are in a current!

1896
01:39:49,283 --> 01:39:50,767
Steady, steady, steady!

1897
01:39:50,844 --> 01:39:52,345
Use the arms to keep us...

1898
01:39:55,722 --> 01:39:56,732
Keep control!
Stay off the wall!

1899
01:39:56,756 --> 01:39:58,058
Hold it!
Stay off the wall!

1900
01:40:20,114 --> 01:40:21,278
What now?

1901
01:40:21,415 --> 01:40:22,749
You are the last knight.

1902
01:40:22,798 --> 01:40:25,382
You are the Earl's special guy.

1903
01:40:25,406 --> 01:40:26,969
You figure it out.

1904
01:40:28,711 --> 01:40:29,568
Let's go.

1905
01:40:30,087 --> 01:40:31,578
I am not going in that water.

1906
01:40:31,603 --> 01:40:34,246
My gears would be sucked
into my main shaft.

1907
01:40:38,232 --> 01:40:40,434
Now you are both on my shit list.

1908
01:41:06,826 --> 01:41:08,021
We were blinded.

1909
01:41:08,795 --> 01:41:10,190
Blinded by the sun.

1910
01:41:11,165 --> 01:41:13,565
The planet hid its approach behind our star.

1911
01:41:13,800 --> 01:41:15,140
It seems to be acting...

1912
01:41:16,421 --> 01:41:17,557
deliberately.

1913
01:41:41,120 --> 01:41:42,886
Dozens of strikes currently modeled.

1914
01:41:44,178 --> 01:41:45,254
First impact,

1915
01:41:45,279 --> 01:41:46,855
will be Alpha Station.

1916
01:41:47,167 --> 01:41:48,394
There is no escape pod.

1917
01:41:49,069 --> 01:41:50,771
<i>Earth will follow two hours later.</i>

1918
01:41:51,405 --> 01:41:54,441
Dominic modeled potential
casualties in the tens of millions.

1919
01:41:57,075 --> 01:41:58,186
There is two moons!

1920
01:41:58,312 --> 01:41:59,602
There is two moons!

1921
01:42:00,447 --> 01:42:01,743
The world is ending?

1922
01:42:03,317 --> 01:42:04,853
<i>Some are saying
that it's going to be a global killer.</i>

1923
01:42:04,878 --> 01:42:08,234
<i>Human civilization as we know it
will change in 12 hours.</i>

1924
01:42:08,259 --> 01:42:10,907
<i>The destruction, we are told by experts,
will be immense.</i>

1925
01:42:28,175 --> 01:42:29,252
This is unbelievable.

1926
01:42:29,276 --> 01:42:30,561
Yeah, it is unbelievable.

1927
01:42:30,661 --> 01:42:32,061
What does the old man want us to do?

1928
01:42:39,919 --> 01:42:41,635
Bee, go around, find another way! Come on!

1929
01:42:41,660 --> 01:42:42,910
What?
Are you serious?

1930
01:42:42,935 --> 01:42:45,171
Think I like winding up in a place like this?

1931
01:42:51,365 --> 01:42:52,767
It wants us to go this way.

1932
01:42:56,158 --> 01:42:58,837
Daytrader! Son of a bitch actually
came through with our ship!

1933
01:42:58,862 --> 01:43:01,592
Excellent.
We are going to England.

1934
01:43:01,617 --> 01:43:03,332
Things are likely to get nasty.

1935
01:43:03,356 --> 01:43:04,708
Real nasty.
Hey, can I come?

1936
01:43:05,202 --> 01:43:06,452
He might need me.

1937
01:43:06,477 --> 01:43:09,129
Oh, little lady hell, I ain't no Earth parent.

1938
01:43:09,153 --> 01:43:10,187
Hop aboard.

1939
01:43:10,284 --> 01:43:11,945
Take a field trip to the front lines.

1940
01:43:12,134 --> 01:43:13,538
Let's go make some noise.

1941
01:43:13,563 --> 01:43:15,087
Let's give them hell.

1942
01:43:15,455 --> 01:43:17,123
I am driving.

1943
01:43:17,761 --> 01:43:20,530
Hey Cade, I am reluctant
to say this to you but...

1944
01:43:20,694 --> 01:43:22,017
I think that you are quite,

1945
01:43:22,233 --> 01:43:23,826
you know, brave.

1946
01:43:23,851 --> 01:43:25,225
Is that a compliment?

1947
01:43:26,094 --> 01:43:28,014
You could throw one back my way.

1948
01:43:28,039 --> 01:43:29,907
Well, that's got to happen organically.

1949
01:43:30,937 --> 01:43:32,345
I was the first off the sub.

1950
01:43:39,313 --> 01:43:40,714
Hold it. Hold it.

1951
01:43:41,615 --> 01:43:42,938
I think it's here!

1952
01:44:17,351 --> 01:44:18,352
It's a tomb.

1953
01:44:20,354 --> 01:44:21,397
<i>Station Houston.</i>

1954
01:44:21,421 --> 01:44:24,765
<i>Page five of the safe zone config procedure.</i>

1955
01:44:25,073 --> 01:44:27,206
<i>Take thrusters to auto.</i>

1956
01:44:28,995 --> 01:44:30,182
It's happening.

1957
01:44:31,331 --> 01:44:32,823
It's in our atmosphere now.

1958
01:44:32,999 --> 01:44:34,557
ISS is our first hit.

1959
01:44:34,734 --> 01:44:36,603
<i>Progress manifolds both failed.</i>

1960
01:44:36,636 --> 01:44:38,096
<i>No thrusters available.</i>

1961
01:44:39,339 --> 01:44:40,878
<i>Conjunction is imminent.</i>

1962
01:44:41,675 --> 01:44:44,292
Good luck and Godspeed.

1963
01:44:53,487 --> 01:44:54,781
Move in, move in, check up.

1964
01:45:03,497 --> 01:45:04,798
Formality.

1965
01:45:05,675 --> 01:45:08,052
Knights are always guarding something.

1966
01:45:11,255 --> 01:45:12,474
Hang on. Look at this.

1967
01:45:13,039 --> 01:45:14,240
It's Celtic.

1968
01:45:35,061 --> 01:45:36,321
It's Merlin.

1969
01:45:37,397 --> 01:45:38,532
It's real.

1970
01:45:38,832 --> 01:45:39,938
All of it!

1971
01:45:40,820 --> 01:45:41,921
Wait, what does this say?

1972
01:45:44,738 --> 01:45:46,406
It means, No one shall have it.

1973
01:45:46,806 --> 01:45:48,663
Wait a minute. We came all
the way down here,

1974
01:45:48,913 --> 01:45:50,035
all this,

1975
01:45:50,677 --> 01:45:51,972
and you are not gonna open it?

1976
01:45:53,286 --> 01:45:54,486
Of course I am going to open it.

1977
01:45:54,648 --> 01:45:56,277
Good. Let's go.

1978
01:45:57,116 --> 01:45:58,048
Ready?

1979
01:45:58,259 --> 01:45:59,253
Let's do this.

1980
01:46:12,399 --> 01:46:13,399
You got to be kidding me.

1981
01:46:17,103 --> 01:46:18,622
We have come all this way for this?

1982
01:46:19,647 --> 01:46:21,197
For your ugly great-great grandad's

1983
01:46:21,221 --> 01:46:23,451
bones in a box and some stupid stick?

1984
01:46:23,795 --> 01:46:24,708
You got to be kidding me.

1985
01:46:24,733 --> 01:46:26,281
How are we gonna
save the world with this?

1986
01:46:26,561 --> 01:46:28,342
I could have cut an oak tree
down at my house and...

1987
01:46:29,583 --> 01:46:30,998
Don't say a word. Ok?

1988
01:46:31,099 --> 01:46:33,769
The smooth little romantic
accent's not gonna work right now.

1989
01:46:34,588 --> 01:46:36,551
I am speechless.
Thank God.

1990
01:46:36,731 --> 01:46:38,132
Maybe someone stole it?

1991
01:46:38,157 --> 01:46:40,598
No, there is something else.
It's got to be here somewhere.

1992
01:46:41,728 --> 01:46:43,567
I didn't come all this way for nothing.

1993
01:46:44,163 --> 01:46:45,825
The whole world is at stake.

1994
01:46:54,056 --> 01:46:54,813
Guys,

1995
01:46:55,296 --> 01:46:56,494
the meters are freaking.

1996
01:46:57,441 --> 01:46:58,733
I got thermals everywhere.

1997
01:46:59,241 --> 01:47:00,488
These things, they...

1998
01:47:01,304 --> 01:47:02,832
They could still be alive.

1999
01:47:05,074 --> 01:47:06,882
The hell happened to you?

2000
01:47:14,894 --> 01:47:17,568
Who has come for the staff?

2001
01:47:19,882 --> 01:47:21,242
Shoot him! Shoot him!

2002
01:47:25,505 --> 01:47:27,336
Move!
Get out!

2003
01:47:30,910 --> 01:47:32,712
I am going to distract him.
Get out of here.

2004
01:47:35,515 --> 01:47:37,276
I have the staff!
Hit it!

2005
01:47:45,925 --> 01:47:47,894
Protect the staff.

2006
01:47:53,700 --> 01:47:55,013
Take his eyes out!

2007
01:48:27,011 --> 01:48:28,522
Who, this thing is moving.

2008
01:48:29,483 --> 01:48:30,428
Corner her!

2009
01:48:30,837 --> 01:48:31,537
Hey.

2010
01:48:32,238 --> 01:48:33,269
Drop the weapon.

2011
01:48:35,909 --> 01:48:36,792
Do it!

2012
01:48:40,279 --> 01:48:42,161
You drop it or I will.

2013
01:48:45,018 --> 01:48:46,299
You don't know what you are doing,
Lennox.

2014
01:48:46,324 --> 01:48:47,635
Stop!
All I want is that weapon!

2015
01:48:47,660 --> 01:48:49,088
Go ahead, shoot me!
No!

2016
01:48:49,689 --> 01:48:51,314
Only I can wield it.

2017
01:48:51,686 --> 01:48:52,533
Go on!

2018
01:48:53,727 --> 01:48:54,728
Do it!

2019
01:48:55,536 --> 01:48:56,570
Shoot me!

2020
01:48:57,063 --> 01:48:58,798
You don't know what you are doing, Lennox.

2021
01:49:00,567 --> 01:49:01,477
Don't.

2022
01:49:03,637 --> 01:49:05,038
Protect the staff.

2023
01:49:22,756 --> 01:49:26,231
I have come for that staff.

2024
01:49:31,965 --> 01:49:33,179
Optimus.

2025
01:49:33,769 --> 01:49:34,738
What are you doing?

2026
01:49:34,866 --> 01:49:36,590
Give it to me.

2027
01:49:36,770 --> 01:49:37,809
It's me, Cade.

2028
01:49:38,324 --> 01:49:41,604
We fought together.
I fight for my own kind!

2029
01:49:41,628 --> 01:49:43,543
My own planet!

2030
01:49:43,977 --> 01:49:45,812
Cade?
This isn't you, Prime.

2031
01:49:45,845 --> 01:49:48,214
Give me the staff, human.

2032
01:49:48,948 --> 01:49:49,949
Cade?

2033
01:49:50,784 --> 01:49:52,819
I will kill you.

2034
01:49:52,852 --> 01:49:53,853
Give it to him.

2035
01:49:59,993 --> 01:50:00,994
Now.

2036
01:50:14,941 --> 01:50:17,644
Who dares to challenge me?

2037
01:50:26,085 --> 01:50:27,184
It's all wrong Bee.

2038
01:50:27,362 --> 01:50:28,997
Something happened.
That is not Optimus.

2039
01:50:29,022 --> 01:50:30,153
You got to find him Bee.

2040
01:50:30,177 --> 01:50:31,376
Remember ZB-7?

2041
01:50:31,415 --> 01:50:33,126
You got to be that Autobot again.

2042
01:50:33,423 --> 01:50:35,021
Look you got to get back
to the sub, alright?

2043
01:50:35,045 --> 01:50:36,790
Get out of here.
Wait, what about you?

2044
01:50:36,815 --> 01:50:38,821
Bee is always had my back.
It's my turn to have his.

2045
01:50:38,931 --> 01:50:40,696
Go.
Alright, get back to the DSV.

2046
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:43,000
Let them know up top that
we lost control of the weapon.

2047
01:50:43,069 --> 01:50:44,259
Roger that sir.

2048
01:50:44,771 --> 01:50:46,446
You heard him.
Back to the sub!

2049
01:50:46,740 --> 01:50:47,884
We are gonna find him.

2050
01:51:41,973 --> 01:51:43,709
Come on, we got to get to the top!

2051
01:51:46,900 --> 01:51:49,102
Holy shit. Holy shit.

2052
01:51:50,436 --> 01:51:52,005
We can make it! Come on!

2053
01:52:06,753 --> 01:52:08,722
Watch out, big wave coming!

2054
01:52:27,339 --> 01:52:29,809
I am Nemesis Prime.

2055
01:52:31,110 --> 01:52:33,212
You are nothing!

2056
01:52:39,252 --> 01:52:40,289
Move it!

2057
01:52:41,513 --> 01:52:43,388
<i>Air is gonna be on station 14 to 16.</i>

2058
01:52:43,413 --> 01:52:46,316
<i>TOC, it looks like
we have a surfaced alien ship.</i>

2059
01:52:47,493 --> 01:52:49,567
<i>Lightning 4 has visual on Optimus.</i>

2060
01:52:54,500 --> 01:52:56,135
Prime! Prime, stop!

2061
01:52:56,502 --> 01:52:59,408
Prime, you got to stop!
Please! Don't do this!

2062
01:53:00,073 --> 01:53:01,140
Look at me, Prime.

2063
01:53:01,507 --> 01:53:03,760
What are you doing?
It's Bee!

2064
01:53:03,977 --> 01:53:06,079
Prime! You can't do this.

2065
01:53:40,119 --> 01:53:41,096
Get off!

2066
01:53:50,616 --> 01:53:51,781
Prime!

2067
01:53:53,827 --> 01:53:55,334
Stop! No!

2068
01:53:56,231 --> 01:53:58,361
I am Bumblebee,

2069
01:53:58,385 --> 01:54:00,639
your oldest friend.

2070
01:54:01,134 --> 01:54:02,335
Optimus,

2071
01:54:03,169 --> 01:54:05,839
I would lay down my life for you.

2072
01:54:14,347 --> 01:54:15,795
Bumblebee.

2073
01:54:16,182 --> 01:54:17,817
Your voice.

2074
01:54:18,184 --> 01:54:20,034
I have not heard it

2075
01:54:20,219 --> 01:54:22,597
since Cybertron fell.

2076
01:54:36,335 --> 01:54:39,433
What have I done?

2077
01:54:50,283 --> 01:54:53,252
You blew your chance to kill Unicron.

2078
01:54:54,120 --> 01:54:56,573
I knew you could not do it.

2079
01:54:57,123 --> 01:54:59,666
Your time is over, Prime.

2080
01:55:00,226 --> 01:55:01,528
You failed.

2081
01:55:02,361 --> 01:55:05,584
You turned your back on Cybertron.

2082
01:55:06,299 --> 01:55:08,968
Now you will watch Earth die.

2083
01:55:11,270 --> 01:55:12,574
No!

2084
01:55:19,012 --> 01:55:20,191
Not going so well.

2085
01:55:32,291 --> 01:55:33,292
Cade!

2086
01:55:38,664 --> 01:55:41,400
You betrayed your own kind.

2087
01:55:41,434 --> 01:55:43,202
No, Prime, get up!

2088
01:55:43,236 --> 01:55:45,848
You chose the wrong side.

2089
01:55:45,972 --> 01:55:47,595
The Guardian Knights,

2090
01:55:47,831 --> 01:55:49,761
are going to kill me.

2091
01:55:50,977 --> 01:55:53,409
Quintessa is the great deceiver!

2092
01:56:00,453 --> 01:56:03,795
The judgment is death.

2093
01:56:34,253 --> 01:56:38,512
Seglass ni Tonday.

2094
01:56:38,757 --> 01:56:41,227
Seglass Ni Tonday.

2095
01:56:41,260 --> 01:56:44,964
Seglass Ni Tonday.

2096
01:56:58,211 --> 01:56:59,375
Cade,

2097
01:56:59,609 --> 01:57:01,726
I have failed you.

2098
01:57:04,083 --> 01:57:06,019
I have doomed Earth.

2099
01:57:07,520 --> 01:57:11,324
Earth, the only place in the universe

2100
01:57:12,125 --> 01:57:14,940
whose people let me call it

2101
01:57:16,262 --> 01:57:17,635
home.

2102
01:57:22,101 --> 01:57:23,805
Only you can make it right, Prime.

2103
01:57:25,538 --> 01:57:27,047
I can't do it without you.

2104
01:57:28,441 --> 01:57:30,013
One moment, that's all we got.

2105
01:57:31,510 --> 01:57:32,935
It's up to you, Prime.

2106
01:57:33,779 --> 01:57:35,014
Because without you,

2107
01:57:35,548 --> 01:57:36,911
we all die.

2108
01:57:40,219 --> 01:57:41,420
It's now or never.

2109
01:57:42,521 --> 01:57:44,081
My brothers,

2110
01:57:44,523 --> 01:57:48,427
I will never betray you again.

2111
01:57:49,428 --> 01:57:51,976
I am Optimus Prime.

2112
01:57:52,331 --> 01:57:53,679
To save Earth,

2113
01:57:53,845 --> 01:57:56,377
we must go to Cybertron

2114
01:57:56,402 --> 01:57:59,062
and destroy Quintessa.

2115
01:58:22,361 --> 01:58:23,962
The ship is coming.

2116
01:58:24,497 --> 01:58:26,486
It is beautiful.

2117
01:58:38,411 --> 01:58:40,724
Optimus Prime gave us
the coordinates for the endgame.

2118
01:58:40,749 --> 01:58:42,004
It's an ignition chamber.

2119
01:58:42,105 --> 01:58:43,387
<i>The weapon is going up there.</i>

2120
01:58:43,473 --> 01:58:45,384
Get Preds and satellites eyes on.

2121
01:58:45,418 --> 01:58:47,863
Find it and prepare to engage.

2122
01:58:49,455 --> 01:58:50,838
<i>Cyclops, 21,000 feet.</i>

2123
01:58:50,863 --> 01:58:52,964
<i>Eyeball target, ignition chamber.
We found it.</i>

2124
01:58:52,989 --> 01:58:54,353
<i>Prime's coordinates are good.</i>

2125
01:58:54,460 --> 01:58:56,780
<i>Contact ignition chamber.
Target in sight.</i>

2126
01:58:57,927 --> 01:58:59,854
Ignition chamber, ignition chamber.

2127
01:58:59,879 --> 01:59:01,881
We have got to figure out
what makes it tick.

2128
01:59:02,068 --> 01:59:03,857
We have got to shut it down!

2129
01:59:04,437 --> 01:59:05,702
Come on, come on, come on!

2130
01:59:07,137 --> 01:59:08,338
Good to see you.

2131
01:59:08,574 --> 01:59:10,616
Let's get out of here!
Let's go!

2132
01:59:13,419 --> 01:59:15,009
General, we are gonna prep a HALO jump

2133
01:59:15,033 --> 01:59:16,451
on that ignition chamber.

2134
01:59:16,576 --> 01:59:18,333
Planes will never nav through those vines.

2135
01:59:18,494 --> 01:59:20,990
Lennox, trust me.
That's our ride right there.

2136
01:59:21,772 --> 01:59:24,124
Our Autobot ship.
Put the Ospreys in that.

2137
01:59:24,244 --> 01:59:25,445
It will get us up there.

2138
01:59:25,694 --> 01:59:27,630
Autobot ship is gonna drop the Ospreys.

2139
01:59:27,655 --> 01:59:29,974
They will virtually glide to the LZ.
It's gonna be high-risk.

2140
01:59:29,999 --> 01:59:32,645
They want to do what at 20,000 feet?

2141
01:59:32,670 --> 01:59:34,867
Sir, there is this girl.
Woman actually. Teacher.

2142
01:59:34,900 --> 01:59:37,102
Oxford.
She plays a little polo.

2143
01:59:37,936 --> 01:59:39,880
Well, that's fantastic.

2144
01:59:40,267 --> 01:59:43,108
<i>They are gonna break her into
the chamber to steal the staff.</i>

2145
01:59:43,247 --> 01:59:46,865
Ok, that is the dumbest idea
you could possibly have!

2146
01:59:46,958 --> 01:59:50,449
<i>Personally, I am gonna rely on physics
and mathematics to save the planet,</i>

2147
01:59:50,483 --> 01:59:53,152
<i>not mysticism, fairies,
and some hobgoblins.</i>

2148
02:00:10,536 --> 02:00:12,233
I have lived for this.

2149
02:00:12,258 --> 02:00:14,826
I have lived to kill a planet!

2150
02:00:15,574 --> 02:00:17,156
For our world,

2151
02:00:17,180 --> 02:00:19,115
I activate this portal!

2152
02:00:35,528 --> 02:00:36,430
Fire!

2153
02:00:59,252 --> 02:01:01,554
You wretched human!

2154
02:01:20,573 --> 02:01:21,444
Hey!

2155
02:01:26,312 --> 02:01:27,085
Hey.

2156
02:01:29,382 --> 02:01:31,140
You got my message.
You brought everyone here.

2157
02:01:31,398 --> 02:01:32,241
Come on.

2158
02:01:34,753 --> 02:01:35,754
Hey!

2159
02:01:36,455 --> 02:01:38,226
I just found Optimus Prime!

2160
02:01:39,625 --> 02:01:41,343
He is gonna deal with all this shit!

2161
02:01:42,255 --> 02:01:43,812
He is gonna save our asses!

2162
02:01:45,431 --> 02:01:47,507
I brought the troops, man.
I brought the troops.

2163
02:01:48,634 --> 02:01:50,710
Knights, Autobots,

2164
02:01:50,823 --> 02:01:54,437
this cannot and will not be the end.

2165
02:01:56,309 --> 02:01:58,777
To save Earth and her people,

2166
02:01:59,171 --> 02:02:02,274
we are going to steal Quintessa's staff.

2167
02:02:02,815 --> 02:02:06,012
Only you Viviane, can take it back.

2168
02:02:07,786 --> 02:02:10,658
I will lead the way into her chamber.

2169
02:02:11,832 --> 02:02:14,273
And when the account of the ages,

2170
02:02:14,297 --> 02:02:16,236
is etched into the cosmos,

2171
02:02:16,595 --> 02:02:20,399
let those who exist long after us know...

2172
02:02:20,799 --> 02:02:24,221
that this was our finest hour.

2173
02:02:30,299 --> 02:02:31,791
Love that guy.

2174
02:02:31,815 --> 02:02:33,521
Goosebumps every time.

2175
02:02:33,546 --> 02:02:35,006
I never got to say hi.

2176
02:02:37,683 --> 02:02:39,077
Here they come.

2177
02:02:39,552 --> 02:02:41,086
You think there is enough?

2178
02:02:41,119 --> 02:02:42,488
No, not even close.

2179
02:02:44,890 --> 02:02:47,020
My lord!
Lord Folgan!

2180
02:02:56,835 --> 02:02:58,502
I had it Cogman.

2181
02:03:00,440 --> 02:03:02,202
I had my moment.

2182
02:03:04,040 --> 02:03:05,460
You did my lord.

2183
02:03:07,580 --> 02:03:09,448
This is the hardest part of my job.

2184
02:03:10,241 --> 02:03:12,409
Watching Folgans die.

2185
02:03:13,652 --> 02:03:15,293
Thank you Cogman.

2186
02:03:16,121 --> 02:03:17,364
Carry on.

2187
02:03:22,094 --> 02:03:25,237
Of all the earls I have had
the pleasure to serve,

2188
02:03:26,024 --> 02:03:28,560
you were by far the coolest.

2189
02:03:41,343 --> 02:03:44,702
I have found your staff of power.

2190
02:03:45,150 --> 02:03:47,486
There is only one who can hurt us.

2191
02:03:47,786 --> 02:03:49,243
I felt her.

2192
02:03:49,595 --> 02:03:51,251
She must not enter.

2193
02:03:51,276 --> 02:03:53,858
My army will stop them.

2194
02:03:54,627 --> 02:03:56,792
Watch as our world heals

2195
02:03:57,011 --> 02:03:58,992
and theirs dies.

2196
02:03:59,843 --> 02:04:01,845
A world reborn!

2197
02:04:27,693 --> 02:04:28,927
It's coming.

2198
02:04:43,876 --> 02:04:45,150
It's gonna crush us.

2199
02:04:45,544 --> 02:04:47,513
Get that ship clear
of the crush zone now!

2200
02:04:47,546 --> 02:04:49,615
We got to bail!
Move to the Ospreys!

2201
02:04:59,224 --> 02:05:01,660
Move, move, move!
To the Ospreys!

2202
02:05:01,694 --> 02:05:03,454
That thing is gonna roll right over us!

2203
02:05:12,571 --> 02:05:13,572
Move!

2204
02:05:25,204 --> 02:05:28,174
<i>Preliminary numbers
are starting to come in.</i>

2205
02:05:28,199 --> 02:05:30,719
<i>Literally scraping away cities.</i>

2206
02:05:30,743 --> 02:05:32,404
<i>Millions will die.</i>

2207
02:05:46,004 --> 02:05:47,808
It's using Earth's geothermal energy

2208
02:05:47,833 --> 02:05:49,777
<i>to reconstitute, to rebuild itself, alright?</i>

2209
02:05:49,908 --> 02:05:53,184
<i>If our core cools,
which is rapidly cooling right now,</i>

2210
02:05:53,247 --> 02:05:55,622
<i>the magnetic field dissolves,
exposing us to...</i>

2211
02:05:55,681 --> 02:05:57,516
high levels of cosmic radiation.

2212
02:05:58,083 --> 02:05:59,752
<i>Maybe you will understand this.</i>

2213
02:06:00,052 --> 02:06:01,717
<i>The Earth becomes a microwave.</i>

2214
02:06:01,887 --> 02:06:02,960
We are the popcorn.

2215
02:06:02,984 --> 02:06:04,590
Jiffy Pop bag, goes...

2216
02:06:04,724 --> 02:06:05,355
boom.

2217
02:06:06,414 --> 02:06:08,416
We fry.

2218
02:06:21,774 --> 02:06:23,578
Very mean looking.

2219
02:06:23,709 --> 02:06:26,078
Oh, they look like wusses to me.

2220
02:06:26,763 --> 02:06:28,461
No, they all messed up.

2221
02:06:29,204 --> 02:06:30,487
Two minutes!

2222
02:06:30,511 --> 02:06:31,833
Hey, two minutes!

2223
02:06:31,950 --> 02:06:34,021
That thing kill Decepticons?
No.

2224
02:06:34,777 --> 02:06:35,841
We do.

2225
02:06:38,356 --> 02:06:41,552
A few brave warriors willing
to sacrifice all.

2226
02:06:42,661 --> 02:06:44,721
I told my students that was bullshit.

2227
02:06:45,130 --> 02:06:46,502
Load out, let's go!

2228
02:06:48,521 --> 02:06:49,598
What are you doing tomorrow?

2229
02:06:49,802 --> 02:06:51,103
Are you asking me that now?

2230
02:06:51,136 --> 02:06:52,137
Yeah, I am.

2231
02:06:52,650 --> 02:06:53,677
No plans?

2232
02:06:54,239 --> 02:06:55,181
Good.

2233
02:06:55,874 --> 02:06:56,975
Get in the plane.

2234
02:06:57,810 --> 02:06:59,364
Let's go, let's go!
Let's step it up!

2235
02:06:59,389 --> 02:07:01,693
Come on, let's go!
Strap in. It's gonna be a rough ride.

2236
02:07:01,718 --> 02:07:03,749
Let's go, let's go!
Tighter, I am gonna hook you up.

2237
02:07:03,782 --> 02:07:05,350
Pull it down tight, right?
Just this one?

2238
02:07:05,516 --> 02:07:06,951
You see, you jump.
And I mean,

2239
02:07:06,976 --> 02:07:08,220
This is the one I pull, right?
Then pull this.

2240
02:07:08,245 --> 02:07:10,132
Pull? Just pull it?
You just pull it as hard as you can?

2241
02:07:10,956 --> 02:07:11,957
Are you alright?

2242
02:07:12,834 --> 02:07:13,947
Can I borrow your cell phone?

2243
02:07:13,971 --> 02:07:15,210
I have got to text my daughter.

2244
02:07:15,393 --> 02:07:16,416
Thanks.

2245
02:07:24,402 --> 02:07:25,420
Alright.

2246
02:07:25,872 --> 02:07:26,834
Thank you.

2247
02:07:38,150 --> 02:07:39,434
<i>Target in sight.</i>

2248
02:07:41,153 --> 02:07:42,630
Contact, ignition chamber.

2249
02:07:42,821 --> 02:07:44,356
<i>Strike package.
Execute. Execute.</i>

2250
02:07:44,381 --> 02:07:46,059
Fight is on, fight is on, fight is on.

2251
02:07:56,401 --> 02:07:58,045
<i>Bogeys inbound.
Bogeys inbound.</i>

2252
02:07:58,704 --> 02:08:01,039
Bee, get to your ship.
Good luck.

2253
02:08:01,722 --> 02:08:03,183
Thirty seconds to drop!

2254
02:08:03,876 --> 02:08:05,778
Those birds better be softening our target.

2255
02:08:05,811 --> 02:08:07,931
You are not giving me that
warm, fuzzy feeling, Lennox.

2256
02:08:07,956 --> 02:08:09,792
The Osprey's flight ceiling is 12,000 feet.

2257
02:08:09,817 --> 02:08:10,784
We are double that.

2258
02:08:10,883 --> 02:08:12,985
The air is too thin, the rotor is got no grab.

2259
02:08:13,018 --> 02:08:14,441
We are gonna be coming in hard.

2260
02:08:14,987 --> 02:08:16,754
It's all bad news.
Oh, yeah.

2261
02:08:19,620 --> 02:08:20,721
All good, Yeager?

2262
02:08:21,159 --> 02:08:22,558
You got something to say?

2263
02:08:23,095 --> 02:08:24,899
You and your guys
never stopped hunting me.

2264
02:08:25,130 --> 02:08:26,103
Orders.

2265
02:08:26,267 --> 02:08:27,272
You were with them.

2266
02:08:27,465 --> 02:08:28,465
With them?

2267
02:08:29,001 --> 02:08:30,649
I believed in one of the great ones.

2268
02:08:30,735 --> 02:08:31,900
Optimus Prime.

2269
02:08:32,158 --> 02:08:33,782
And his crew.
I never lost faith.

2270
02:08:33,939 --> 02:08:35,974
You did.
The whole world did.

2271
02:08:36,463 --> 02:08:37,842
Now you want to fly with me.

2272
02:08:40,012 --> 02:08:42,311
Well, I appreciate you guys
making the trip. Thank you.

2273
02:08:49,054 --> 02:08:50,188
Get that staff,

2274
02:08:51,489 --> 02:08:52,855
we all go home.

2275
02:08:59,727 --> 02:09:01,829
<i>Lennox, your team is to hold.</i>

2276
02:09:01,934 --> 02:09:03,435
<i>Strike fighters are getting shot down.</i>

2277
02:09:03,468 --> 02:09:07,205
Oh. no, it's now or never.
Pilots, go now! Go!

2278
02:09:07,239 --> 02:09:08,227
Hang on!

2279
02:09:09,107 --> 02:09:10,232
Chihuahua.

2280
02:09:10,257 --> 02:09:11,356
What are you doing here?

2281
02:09:11,573 --> 02:09:12,880
I don't know.

2282
02:09:13,078 --> 02:09:14,847
But... but you said we were family.

2283
02:09:14,880 --> 02:09:17,544
No, I didn't mean...
We got to get her off here now.

2284
02:09:18,250 --> 02:09:19,785
It was probably a bad idea.

2285
02:09:26,084 --> 02:09:27,623
<i>Six birds out of the nest.</i>

2286
02:09:34,266 --> 02:09:36,601
All Ospreys clear.
Push the target, push the target.

2287
02:09:41,006 --> 02:09:41,940
Hang on!

2288
02:09:41,974 --> 02:09:44,176
Chihuahua. It's ok.
It's ok.

2289
02:09:54,252 --> 02:09:56,447
<i>All fast movers, distract, distract.</i>

2290
02:09:56,521 --> 02:09:58,369
Keep those enemies away from the Ospreys!

2291
02:09:58,523 --> 02:10:00,048
Bogeys dead ahead!

2292
02:10:05,296 --> 02:10:07,444
<i>Control, spread it out, spread it out.</i>

2293
02:10:14,006 --> 02:10:16,447
Those fighters better
distract those enemy ships!

2294
02:10:19,099 --> 02:10:20,923
<i>I got bogeys coming in hot, one o'clock.</i>

2295
02:10:26,118 --> 02:10:27,305
<i>I got three bogeys.</i>

2296
02:10:30,523 --> 02:10:31,766
Watch the rotor!

2297
02:10:35,160 --> 02:10:36,718
Sir, bird three just went down!

2298
02:10:57,115 --> 02:10:58,635
There is our landing zone.

2299
02:11:01,319 --> 02:11:02,889
Take that big gun out.

2300
02:11:04,589 --> 02:11:06,791
Viper Flight, focus on that gun.

2301
02:11:13,631 --> 02:11:15,267
Hold on, we are going down!

2302
02:11:15,300 --> 02:11:16,473
<i>It's gonna be a hard hit.</i>

2303
02:11:16,498 --> 02:11:17,787
Don't slide off the edge!

2304
02:11:17,812 --> 02:11:18,951
<i>Brace, brace, brace!</i>

2305
02:11:20,405 --> 02:11:21,763
<i>Two is down, two is down.</i>

2306
02:11:32,184 --> 02:11:33,441
Brace for impact!

2307
02:11:42,060 --> 02:11:43,633
Out of the bird! Out of the bird!

2308
02:11:43,657 --> 02:11:45,513
Grab a buddy!
Out of the bird!

2309
02:11:47,099 --> 02:11:48,474
Get out of the bird! Go!

2310
02:11:49,201 --> 02:11:50,763
Back up. Hurry up, back up.

2311
02:11:55,013 --> 02:11:56,041
Enemy fighters!

2312
02:12:32,477 --> 02:12:35,013
That gun emplacement is tearing us apart!

2313
02:12:39,284 --> 02:12:41,919
There is the ignition chamber,
dead ahead!

2314
02:12:46,691 --> 02:12:48,661
<i>Air cover not coming. Unable.</i>

2315
02:12:53,031 --> 02:12:54,266
Let's ride, Bee!

2316
02:12:54,299 --> 02:12:55,568
Let's kick ass!

2317
02:13:02,507 --> 02:13:04,214
Push right to the crater!

2318
02:13:04,238 --> 02:13:05,311
Let's go!

2319
02:13:15,619 --> 02:13:17,244
Pinned down with the Hound!

2320
02:13:19,992 --> 02:13:21,486
No way. Where is Optimus?

2321
02:13:21,759 --> 02:13:23,116
They said he never made it.

2322
02:13:24,196 --> 02:13:25,593
We got the big gun on us!

2323
02:13:25,989 --> 02:13:27,233
We are pinned down!

2324
02:13:29,034 --> 02:13:31,351
Negative to target.
Unable to advance.

2325
02:13:33,505 --> 02:13:35,440
Get back here, Izzy!
Izzy!

2326
02:13:35,473 --> 02:13:36,741
I will be right back!

2327
02:13:36,774 --> 02:13:39,311
It's just a cluster effing thingamabob!

2328
02:13:45,150 --> 02:13:47,152
Sqweeks! Hey, hey...

2329
02:13:47,185 --> 02:13:49,620
Look, I need you to blow that gun up!

2330
02:13:51,745 --> 02:13:52,699
Mommy.

2331
02:13:52,858 --> 02:13:55,218
You are small and you are ugly.
No one is gonna see you coming.

2332
02:13:57,512 --> 02:13:58,672
Blow it up!

2333
02:14:04,802 --> 02:14:06,438
Infernocus,

2334
02:14:06,653 --> 02:14:09,255
transform. Kill them!

2335
02:14:14,546 --> 02:14:16,690
I don't have enough ammo for that thing.

2336
02:14:16,894 --> 02:14:17,948
I got him!

2337
02:14:35,533 --> 02:14:38,070
Bee and Hot Rod are down!
Autobots down!

2338
02:14:38,103 --> 02:14:39,237
Where is Prime?

2339
02:14:39,271 --> 02:14:40,405
Ay, chihuahua.

2340
02:14:40,438 --> 02:14:42,500
<i>It's a no-go, General.
We are pinned down!</i>

2341
02:14:42,525 --> 02:14:44,817
Yeah, well, that hobgoblin stuff
didn't work, did it?

2342
02:14:44,842 --> 02:14:47,212
I got a Hail Mary.
How about physics?

2343
02:14:47,412 --> 02:14:48,422
Ok, I just did the simulation.

2344
02:14:48,446 --> 02:14:50,515
It's like if Tiger Woods
was making a big divot

2345
02:14:50,548 --> 02:14:51,549
with his nine-iron.

2346
02:14:51,583 --> 02:14:53,051
Stu, out! Come on, man.

2347
02:14:53,753 --> 02:14:55,721
Alright, there is a chunk right here
that's held up by thin vines.

2348
02:14:55,753 --> 02:14:57,906
You got to blow up those vines,
use tactical nukes to blow out

2349
02:14:57,931 --> 02:14:59,151
the vines and let it swing.

2350
02:14:59,176 --> 02:15:00,333
Ok, you let gravity do the rest.

2351
02:15:00,358 --> 02:15:01,426
<i>The chamber comes down,</i>

2352
02:15:01,451 --> 02:15:03,329
the energy transfer stops,
and the Earth is saved.

2353
02:15:03,361 --> 02:15:04,362
You are welcome.

2354
02:15:04,629 --> 02:15:06,712
I need tac-nuke authority.

2355
02:15:06,737 --> 02:15:08,296
<i>Lennox team, we are pulling you out.</i>

2356
02:15:08,441 --> 02:15:09,337
<i>Mission is over.</i>

2357
02:15:09,362 --> 02:15:11,198
<i>Laze targets for incoming strike fighters.</i>

2358
02:15:11,223 --> 02:15:12,572
<i>Then I am ordering you to bail.</i>

2359
02:15:12,597 --> 02:15:13,698
Roger that. Picture is up.

2360
02:15:14,272 --> 02:15:15,510
I see it, I see it.

2361
02:15:16,408 --> 02:15:17,556
We got a new target!

2362
02:15:18,236 --> 02:15:19,552
Three o'clock high!

2363
02:15:19,759 --> 02:15:22,118
Laze the new target for incoming birds.

2364
02:15:22,314 --> 02:15:23,906
They are gonna bring
that whole thing down on us.

2365
02:15:23,931 --> 02:15:25,595
Hey!
We are not giving up on Prime, ok?

2366
02:15:25,735 --> 02:15:26,665
He is gonna be here!

2367
02:15:26,690 --> 02:15:28,798
They just changed the whole plan.
We can't get inside.

2368
02:15:28,853 --> 02:15:30,798
What?
The operation is over.

2369
02:15:31,223 --> 02:15:32,484
We stay, we are dead.

2370
02:15:32,509 --> 02:15:34,447
I have to get in there!
Everybody, grab your chutes!

2371
02:15:34,471 --> 02:15:35,415
We are bailing!

2372
02:15:39,264 --> 02:15:40,265
You.

2373
02:15:48,240 --> 02:15:49,914
<i>Fight, fight, fight.
Fight is on.</i>

2374
02:15:56,414 --> 02:15:57,921
Good job, little friend.

2375
02:15:58,350 --> 02:16:00,578
Laze the target!
Move, move, move!

2376
02:16:02,220 --> 02:16:03,131
Let's move! Come on!

2377
02:16:03,156 --> 02:16:04,227
Let's move out!
Go!

2378
02:16:04,251 --> 02:16:05,702
We got you covered! Move!

2379
02:16:10,895 --> 02:16:12,053
Optimus.

2380
02:16:15,233 --> 02:16:16,234
Yeah!

2381
02:16:35,187 --> 02:16:37,489
You ugly mess!

2382
02:16:40,711 --> 02:16:43,781
Did you forget who I am?

2383
02:16:54,506 --> 02:16:57,409
I am Optimus Prime.

2384
02:16:57,642 --> 02:16:59,959
Autobots, attack!

2385
02:17:09,136 --> 02:17:10,261
Laze the target!

2386
02:17:10,688 --> 02:17:12,357
Laze it, laze it, laze it.

2387
02:17:13,277 --> 02:17:14,339
<i>Laser paint confirmed.</i>

2388
02:17:14,363 --> 02:17:16,042
<i>Laser paint confirmed on target.</i>
Come on!

2389
02:17:16,067 --> 02:17:17,507
<i>Silver arrows, fire.</i>

2390
02:17:18,296 --> 02:17:19,931
<i>Missiles away, missiles away.</i>

2391
02:17:19,964 --> 02:17:21,085
Go, go!

2392
02:17:22,252 --> 02:17:23,272
Go!

2393
02:17:25,002 --> 02:17:27,345
Come on, let's go!
I don't think I can do this.

2394
02:17:27,752 --> 02:17:28,922
Go! Go!

2395
02:17:28,947 --> 02:17:29,974
Nine seconds.

2396
02:17:30,007 --> 02:17:31,249
We are going home, Izzy.

2397
02:17:33,445 --> 02:17:34,889
Mademoiselle, don't go!

2398
02:17:35,713 --> 02:17:37,315
Where is Viviane?

2399
02:17:37,349 --> 02:17:39,584
She is gone, boss.
They are all chickening out.

2400
02:17:40,036 --> 02:17:42,056
What if you are wrong, Lennox?
What if it doesn't work?

2401
02:17:42,081 --> 02:17:43,177
It's gonna work!

2402
02:17:43,691 --> 02:17:44,369
Look,

2403
02:17:44,393 --> 02:17:46,159
we are doing this together, ok?
Here we go.

2404
02:17:46,276 --> 02:17:48,347
Hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it...

2405
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:57,298
We got to go!

2406
02:17:57,833 --> 02:17:58,981
We are bailing.

2407
02:17:59,471 --> 02:18:01,639
What are you doing?
It's just dusty old books.

2408
02:18:01,673 --> 02:18:02,544
What?

2409
02:18:05,343 --> 02:18:06,174
Wait!

2410
02:18:06,611 --> 02:18:08,580
She is got to be kidding me. Shit!

2411
02:18:24,696 --> 02:18:25,785
Viviane!

2412
02:18:25,933 --> 02:18:27,155
Get in here!

2413
02:18:27,180 --> 02:18:28,616
Yes!
My little lady.

2414
02:18:43,646 --> 02:18:44,309
Wait!

2415
02:18:48,786 --> 02:18:49,787
Cade!

2416
02:18:57,795 --> 02:19:00,732
<i>Command be advised,
ignition chamber is tumbling.</i>

2417
02:19:01,065 --> 02:19:03,401
<i>I repeat, chamber is broke loose.
It is falling.</i>

2418
02:19:12,994 --> 02:19:15,254
<i>The energy transfer is still continuing</i>

2419
02:19:15,547 --> 02:19:17,649
<i>T-minus 55 minutes and counting.</i>

2420
02:19:17,682 --> 02:19:18,955
I can't believe it didn't work.

2421
02:19:19,111 --> 02:19:20,528
<i>General, I am in my chute.</i>

2422
02:19:20,552 --> 02:19:23,002
<i>The chamber is still arcing power.
I don't think it worked.</i>

2423
02:19:23,946 --> 02:19:25,089
No!
Hold on!

2424
02:19:42,616 --> 02:19:44,443
Follow me.
I am gonna lead the way.

2425
02:19:49,541 --> 02:19:50,648
Ok, there it is.

2426
02:19:50,682 --> 02:19:52,252
Grab the staff, Viviane!

2427
02:19:53,418 --> 02:19:54,385
Alright, go!

2428
02:20:07,499 --> 02:20:08,500
Watch out, watch out!

2429
02:20:12,704 --> 02:20:13,863
Stop the time!

2430
02:20:14,639 --> 02:20:16,459
Gonna blow your head off, Megatron!

2431
02:20:16,841 --> 02:20:18,676
Sayonara, bubble head!

2432
02:20:35,627 --> 02:20:37,780
Megatron, kill her!

2433
02:20:50,708 --> 02:20:52,877
We were brothers once.

2434
02:20:52,910 --> 02:20:54,145
Once.

2435
02:21:21,854 --> 02:21:24,096
We are going weightless.
Weightless!

2436
02:21:28,880 --> 02:21:30,582
Grab my hand.
Yes!

2437
02:21:40,558 --> 02:21:41,759
Don't let it go!

2438
02:21:47,589 --> 02:21:50,559
Quintessa, get off our planet!

02:21:51,636 --> 02:21:52,964
You traitor!

2440

Bumblebee.

2442
02:22:07,284 --> 02:22:09,621
Sting like a bee.

2443
02:22:27,304 --> 02:22:28,509
I will save you!

2444
02:22:34,979 --> 02:22:36,319
I stop the time.

2445
02:23:44,882 --> 02:23:46,249

I would not do that.

Don't touch him.

2475
02:26:07,091 --> 02:26:08,356
He doesn't like it.

2476
02:26:09,493 --> 02:26:10,695
Who doesn't like what?

2477

Unicron.

02:26:15,199 --> 02:26:17,301
But I could show you how to kill him.
