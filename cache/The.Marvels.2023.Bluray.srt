1
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:21,600
There's only one here.

2
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,560
They were forged as a pair.

3
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:26,438
We'll keep looking for it.
It must be buried elsewhere.

4
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:27,689
Elsewhere?

5
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,068
Like where?

6
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:48,960
<i>Kamala! Are you
doing your homework, beta?</i>

7
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:50,879
Yeah! Science!

8
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:01,348
Boom!

9
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:03,433
<i>Enter, Kamala Khan.</i>

10
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:04,768
<i>Ready for...</i>

11
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,688
<i>Captain Marvel.</i>

12
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:09,981
<i>She needs my help.</i>

13
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:12,567
<i>Shine on, baby.</i>

14
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:18,281
Ugh! Why are hands
so hard to draw?

15
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,952
<i>Okay, Ms. Marvel arrives,
and just in time,</i>

16
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,829
<i>'cause even the Avengers
need backup, ya know?</i>

17
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,372
<i>Wham! Kapow!</i>

18
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,293
<i>This is my chance!</i>

19
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:34,297
<i>Pow!</i>

20
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:36,967
<i>Boom!</i>

21
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:39,678
Not bad, kid.

22
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,723
What's your name?

23
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:44,224
- Ms. Marvel.

24
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:45,308
- Dude.

25
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:46,476
Twinsies!

26
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,813
Hey, you wanna go party
with the Avengers?

27
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,648
Uh... Yeah!

28
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,109
Oh, uh, can you fly?

29
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:57,154
No, but, um, I can do this!

30
00:03:58,321 --> 00:03:59,406
<i>Kamala!</i>

31
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,324
<i>- Don't make me come up there!</i>

32
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:04,745
That does not sound
like science to me.

33
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:05,829
Okay.

34
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:31,772
<i>You don't remember anything?</i>

35
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,774
<i>I see...</i>

36
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,358
<i>flashes.</i>

37
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:38,653
<i>Little moments.</i>

38
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:41,865
<i>If I could just piece together
what happened that morning,</i>

39
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,117
<i>maybe it'll all make sense.</i>

40
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:56,880
<i>You stole me from my home,
my family, my friends.</i>

41
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,215
Lieutenant Trouble.

42
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:00,133
Higher, further, faster, baby.

43
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:01,218
That's right.

44
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:04,304
Tell the Supreme Intelligence
that I'm coming to end it.

45
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,973
<i>The war, the lies.</i>

46
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,976
- All of it.
- You can't do this.

47
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:11,686
I'll be back
before you know it.

48
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,563
I could fly up
and meet you halfway.

49
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:16,107
Oh, only if you learn to glow
like your Auntie Carol.

50
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:50,308
Come here, Goosey.

51
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,563
<i>Incoming call from Nick Fury.</i>

52
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:57,107
- Oh. You expecting a call?

53
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,693
Maybe we just send it
to voice mail.

54
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,281
Nick Fury,

55
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,950
<i>my favorite one-eyed man
of intrigue.</i>

56
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,159
<i>Carol Danvers.</i>

57
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:10,287
Prodigal child
of the Milky Way.

58
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,496
How goes it out there?

59
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,248
- Thriving.

60
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,293
<i>- What the hell was that?</i>

61
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,419
<i>- Goose?
- Yeah.</i>

62
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,212
<i>- What about you?</i>

63
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:20,463
How are you doing?

64
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:22,007
What do you know
about the surge

65
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,050
in the jump point system
a few hours ago?

66
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,928
I didn't notice
anything unusual.

67
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:28,597
I'll take a look now.

68
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,890
<i>It rattled the whole system.</i>

69
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:31,558
We're trying to get a handle
on what happened.

70
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,101
<i>The entire network was affected?</i>

71
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:34,686
Yeah. End to end.

72
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:36,938
Thankfully,
our neural network team

73
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:40,025
was able to trace the origin
back to MB-418.

74
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:41,610
<i>You're in the neighborhood,
right?</i>

75
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:42,694
Yeah.

76
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,362
Can you check it out?

77
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,240
<i>- I'm on it.
- Appreciate you.</i>

78
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:50,285
<i>Monica and her team will send
more intel as they acquire it.</i>

79
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:51,870
Monica? Wha...

80
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:52,954
What's she doing there?

81
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:54,039
I thought
that she was on Earth.

82
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,916
<i>- Is she okay?
- Yeah.</i>

83
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,919
And she's not
that little kid you remember.

84
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,896
<i>So, do we think that we can
finish this before dinner?</i>

85
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,773
<i>Yeah. I don't think
we're gonna fix it in time</i>

86
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:22,067
<i>to geta reading
on the jump point.</i>

87
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:25,737
<i>But I do know someone
with superpowers who could.</i>

88
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,197
<i>Oh.</i>

89
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,783
<i>Fine. I'll go.</i>

90
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,868
<i>You guys head in and check
the status of the network.</i>

91
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:34,996
<i>We've gotta find this damage
and see if we can reverse it.</i>

92
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:36,373
<i>Aye, aye, Captain.</i>

93
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:07,737
Fury,

94
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,572
<i>I think I found something.</i>

95
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,783
Communications override.

96
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,119
- Captain Rambeau. Spacewalk.

97
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:15,203
<i>Connected.</i>

98
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:16,913
Rambeau,

99
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,498
<i>what the hell are you doin'?</i>

100
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:21,042
<i>Seems the surge has had
some residual effect</i>

101
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:22,585
<i>on the jump point.</i>

102
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,337
<i>I'm gonna get you
some readings, Fury.</i>

103
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:25,463
<i>- Mon...</i>

104
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:27,132
<i>- Hello?
- Monica.</i>

105
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:28,299
<i>Hello?</i>

106
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:36,808
- Was that Monica?

107
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,643
<i>Aunt Carol?</i>

108
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:39,728
Fury, was that Monica?

109
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:40,937
Why, you wanna talk to her?

110
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,606
<i>I... I don't think
I'm in the best...</i>

111
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,359
<i>position to... I... I don't...</i>

112
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:47,694
<i>I don't wanna...</i>

113
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:48,778
<i>Look...</i>

114
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,321
<i>I don't wanna
talk to her like this.</i>

115
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:52,407
<i>- Not after all this time.
- You know,</i>

116
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,950
eventually you're gonna
have to talk to her.

117
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,035
<i>I know.</i>

118
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:56,161
<i>I know, but</i>

119
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:58,455
<i>let's save the family reunions
till I'm back inside.</i>

120
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,549
I think I found
the source of the surge.

121
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:11,509
What are you seeing?

122
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:16,765
It's a jump point,
but it's not closing. Like...

123
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:18,808
it's stuck.

124
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:19,976
<i>Danvers.</i>

125
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:35,033
Danvers.

126
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,243
Danvers!

127
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,418
<i>The jump point's
still leaking energy.</i>

128
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,045
<i>- Captain Rambeau?
- Hello?</i>

129
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,131
<i>- Hello?
- Monica.</i>

130
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,307
<i>Beautiful.</i>

131
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:03,228
<i>Ah.</i>

132
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:04,604
<i>- Ooh.</i>

133
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,385
<i>Oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God!</i>

134
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,934
<i>Stop spinning, stop spinning,
stop spinning, please!</i>

135
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:51,985
<i>It's Nick Fury! Hey!</i>

136
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,320
<i>How did you... Oh, wow.</i>

137
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,239
<i>I'm Kamala Khan.</i>

138
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,199
<i>No, sorry, I'm Ms. Marvel, actually.</i>

139
00:10:58,283 --> 00:10:59,742
<i>But I'm from Jersey City and I...</i>

140
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:02,036
<i>Oh, no, I don't have my mask on.</i>

141
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,247
<i>Is this an Avengers test?</i>

142
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,958
<i>Who the hell are you?</i>

143
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:36,529
Um...

144
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:37,614
Hi.

145
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:40,325
Really good living room.

146
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:42,327
Huh?

147
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:43,870
Kamala?
Kamala?

148
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:53,671
What did you do to me?

149
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:55,882
- What is Dar-Benn doing?
- It's too late.

150
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,134
The Supremor's
already on Tarnax.

151
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,929
- You can't stop this.

152
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:02,180
Watch me.

153
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:18,154
Fury. It's the Kree.

154
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,114
They're going after
the Skrulls on Tarnax.

155
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:23,368
<i>Now, hold on.
Do not go in swinging.</i>

156
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:24,494
<i>This is a peace</i>

157
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:25,870
<i>- and reconciliation tour.
- Fury.</i>

158
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:27,830
<i>- I got this.
- Carol...</i>

159
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,002
So, I switched with
someone named Kamala Khan?

160
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:35,296
Yeah. She seemed to be
as confused as you are.

161
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,548
Well, there's nothing in her
power-set about teleportation.

162
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:38,716
Enough about her.

163
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,469
I wanna know what happened
to you on MB-418.

164
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:42,804
Yes, sir. Uh...

165
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,640
Let me preface this by saying
I'm not really sure. But...

166
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,809
I did not break
my closet door, okay?

167
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:48,977
I was in space.

168
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,812
Oh, so it broke itself?

169
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,647
No, no, no, no, no.
See, I disappeared.

170
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,691
So maybe
Captain Marvel broke it.

171
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:56,567
- What?
- Yes,

172
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:58,278
your friend, Captain Marvel.

173
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:00,280
She was walking up and down
our living room,

174
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:01,489
and now you come back,

175
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,157
waltzing in with no apologies.

176
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:05,368
I'm sorry, Captain Marvel
was in our house?

177
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:08,413
Is Captain Marvel
pressuring you in any way?

178
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,832
Look, I understand
that she's an important figure

179
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:13,376
and all that, but you don't
have to do as she says.

180
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,545
No, no, they're
clearly working together.

181
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:16,629
Look at her face.

182
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:17,714
- Look at her smile.
- Aamir, stop it.

183
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:18,798
She's being
super secretive as always.

184
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:19,882
Aamir,
stop picking on your sister.

185
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:20,967
- Look at her.
- Muneeba.

186
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,427
- Kamala, are you lying again?

187
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,511
Just tell me
if you're involved or...

188
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:24,595
My daughter
has said she's not lying.

189
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:25,680
- Kamala.
- Looks like

190
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:26,764
- she's having so much fun.
- Muneeba...

191
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:28,474
- She's bad at keeping secrets.
- Oh, my God! It's happening!

192
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:38,776
<i>Approaching Tarnax.</i>

193
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:44,282
<i>Warning.</i>

194
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:45,908
<i>Kree ship detected.</i>

195
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,875
This is not what we agreed,
Dar-Benn.

196
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,168
Supremor Dar-Benn.

197
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,504
The Skrull have been scattered

198
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,756
to every corner
of the universe.

199
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,009
Made refugees wherever we go,
and still,

200
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:49,889
we came into these
negotiations in good faith.

201
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,808
I hear you, Dro'ge.

202
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:54,769
I, perhaps more than anyone,

203
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:57,230
understand what you and
your people have been through.

204
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:00,149
After my predecessor
was destroyed,

205
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:03,069
heretics rose up
to fill the void.

206
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:06,864
The Civil War
has polluted our skies.

207
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:08,658
My people cannot breathe.

208
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:12,662
Our sun is dying.

209
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:15,331
Hala is out of time.

210
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:18,084
I hope we can rebuild together.

211
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,086
So much so that I'm willing to put

212
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,338
our ancient animosities behind us.

213
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:26,175
And give you a chance
to protect your people.

214
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:29,303
To stop running.

215
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:35,143
The Skrull will take their rightful place

216
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:36,436
in the Kree Empire.

217
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:40,481
And I will aid in their relocation.

218
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:42,316
Relocation? What?

219
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:44,735
What is the meaning of this?

220
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,364
I would hate
for your people to suffocate

221
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,116
when I strip the atmosphere.

222
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,303
It's the Annihilator!

223
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:26,736
Oh, my God!

224
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:38,539
What the hell is going on?

225
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:40,291
Yes, what the hell
is going on?

226
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:42,168
I was on some freaky spaceship
and then I teleported here.

227
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,419
I don't know
if that's my new power.

228
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:44,670
And then this freaking cat
ate a man.

229
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:45,796
How can a cat
eat a man, Kamala?

230
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,881
I don't know.
It has tentacles

231
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,007
- and it ate a man.
- What tentacles, Kamala?

232
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,133
- I don't know.
- Where are the tentacles?

233
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:50,468
It comes out of his mouth,
and they're...

234
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:51,969
- Oh, my God!

235
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:53,054
Oh!

236
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,972
Oh, my God,
it's happening again!

237
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,064
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
- Kamala, who are they?

238
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,193
- Please run.

239
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:12,114
How did you get here,

240
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,616
and how're you involved in this?

241
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,202
The Kree jury-rigged
a wormhole on MB-418.

242
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,286
You mean like a jump point?

243
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,747
I don't know.
But I touched it and then I...

244
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:20,915
Why'd you do that?

245
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:22,667
Because it was glowing
and mysterious.

246
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,544
Okay, new rule,
no more touching shit.

247
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:26,087
Especially glowing, mysterious shit.

248
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,755
Okay, I'm feeling a lot of
negative energy from you

249
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,215
and I don't like it.
That's not the point.

250
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,717
The point is, is that it was
siphoning off the atmosphere.

251
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:33,052
And it did this!

252
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:34,720
Scissors beat paper.

253
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:36,764
Fury! There was, like, energy
that went around my hand.

254
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:37,974
Focus.

255
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:39,559
Okay, maybe if I do this.

256
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:47,775
Annihilator.

257
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:48,985
I don't like that name.

Let me go! Let me go!
Let me go!

I think I'm getting teleported

whenever I channel
any kind of radiant ener...

I think I switch

Our tests keep
generating the same result.

277
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:03,888
With each new jump point,

278
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:06,432
this band
becomes more unstable.

279
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,851
I strongly suggest we wait
for the second band.

280
00:21:57,608 --> 00:21:59,693
- Oi.

281
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:03,113
Hi, again.

282
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,075
So sorry about earlier.

283
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,785
We're looking for Kamala Khan.

284
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,703
Did I get in?

285
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,540
Is this the new iPad?
I haven't seen it yet.

286
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:13,624
They wish!

287
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:14,792
All right. Come on, let's go.
I know.

288
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,335
Wait, if this is
all top secret information,

289
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:18,671
- why is it on a clear case?
- Uh, well...

290
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:20,297
- ...just swipe it

291
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:21,382
a little bit...
Whoa, whoa.

292
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:22,716
- Hi. Okay.
- Can you believe it?

293
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,718
They have intel on me.

294
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:25,928
On me!

295
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:27,847
I am intel.

296
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:30,850
- Look at you!

297
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:32,977
Hey, what does, um,
S.A.B.E.R. stand for?

298
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,895
Uh, Strategic Aerospace
Biophysics

299
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:36,313
and Exolinguistic Response.

300
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:37,523
That's classified.

301
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:38,899
Sorry.

302
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,318
"Hard Light powers," yes.

303
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:42,403
- "Noor..."
- Okay,

304
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:43,946
but why do you have
intel on her?

305
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,823
Is there some sort
of surveillance on us?

306
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,116
"Surveillance" is a strong word.

307
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,284
Well, ma'am,

308
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:51,078
your daughter is the hero
that saved Jersey City.

309
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:52,913
So, of course
we would have intel

310
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:54,582
on someone like her.
And you're also

311
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:56,166
- electromagnetically altered.

312
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,459
- What does that mean?

313
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,920
Oh, it just means
that we both have

314
00:23:00,004 --> 00:23:01,755
light-based powers.

315
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:04,300
What's your...
What's your code name?

316
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,759
Oh, I don't have a code name.

317
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:07,344
- We'll workshop it.
- No, thank you.

318
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,305
Aunt Carol... Mmm.

319
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:12,057
Captain Marvel
also has light-based powers.

320
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:13,601
It's probably
not a coincidence.

321
00:23:13,684 --> 00:23:16,729
Not to mention the two of you
came into direct contact

322
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:19,064
with some malfunctioning
jump points.

323
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:21,567
I still cannot believe
that Captain Marvel was here

324
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:22,735
and I didn't even
get to meet her.

325
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:23,819
You know,
we're supposed to be all,

326
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:24,904
like, "twinsies!" you know.

327
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:27,197
We have the same name.
I would obviously, then...

328
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:28,490
I don't know, I would just
give her the letter

329
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:29,575
that I wrote for her

330
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:31,577
and we would go out for lunch,
and then it would just...

331
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:34,580
Did you say "Aunt Carol?"

332
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:38,250
I said
that Captain Marvel

333
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:40,169
can absorb light energy.

334
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:41,587
I can see it.

335
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,923
And you, you can turn light

336
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:45,591
into physical matter.

337
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:47,051
Which I have never heard of.

338
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:48,761
- But my working theory...
- I could totally show you.

339
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:50,429
- No!

340
00:23:52,306 --> 00:23:54,475
What the...

341
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:58,520
Hi.

342
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,481
Hi.

343
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:04,485
Nah, they don't
seem related.

344
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:05,736
Whatever, Yusuf.

345
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:08,280
- Families are complicated.
- Hmm.

346
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:11,367
Uh, Monica, you wanna fill Carol in

347
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,118
on your working theory?

348
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:14,787
Yeah. Um...

349
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,747
Hi, Captain Marvel.

350
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:21,043
It is so good to see you,
Lieutenant Trouble.

351
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,294
You too.

352
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:23,963
And it's Captain Rambeau now.

353
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,174
Right. Sorry.

354
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:31,762
So, what's new?

355
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:33,222
- Where's my sister?
- Yeah.

356
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:36,016
I'm thinking that our joint exposure

357
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,643
to these unsteady jump points

358
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:40,813
and our susceptibility
to electromagnetic energy

359
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:43,023
has temporarily entangled our world-lines.

360
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:44,400
Yeah, that, right there.

361
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:46,819
- Uh...
- Entanglement.

362
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:49,029
Our light powers are entangled.

363
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:51,949
So, we switch places whenever
we use them at the same time.

364
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:54,034
- Which would mean Kamala...
- When did you get powers?

365
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,996
I walked through
a radiation shielding barrier

366
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:59,415
of a witch hex and now
I can manipulate and see

367
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,500
all wavelengths of
the electromagnetic spectrum.

368
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:02,584
I'm very happy for you.

369
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:04,003
- Yeah.

370
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:06,422
- Where's our daughter?
- Yes, please. Where is Kamala?

371
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:07,673
Wherever you were.

372
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,049
- Where were you?
- Who's Kamala?

373
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:11,385
The third person we're switching with.

374
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:13,303
Light powers. Teenage girl.

375
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:14,972
- Where were you?
- What are you doing?

376
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:16,223
What are you doing?

377
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:17,850
I'm trying to switch.
Why isn't it working

378
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:19,101
- when I need it to work?
- Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

379
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:20,185
- Danvers, Danvers!
- Hey!

380
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:21,520
- So confused.
- Please tell Kamala

381
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:22,855
<i>that her Abu is very upset.</i>

382
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,648
Where are we going
and why are we going there?

383
00:25:24,732 --> 00:25:27,401
- Carol!
- Carol, where you going?

384
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:38,787
Oh, my God!

385
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:40,164
- Uh-oh!
- Monica...

386
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:41,623
- Mmm-hmm?
- ...you gotta fly.

387
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:43,000
No, no, no. I...

388
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,209
I mean, I know.

389
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:45,878
But technically,
I haven't done that yet!

390
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,421
Yeah, well, you got to now

391
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:49,715
or Kamala's not gonna graduate
from high school.

392
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,091
Come on! Use your core!

393
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:55,971
Oh, jeez.

394
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:57,931
Hey. Black Girl Magic.

395
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:20,913
I got you! I got you!

396
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,915
- I got you!

397
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,500
Oops!

398
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,228
- Hold on!

399
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:46,980
What is happening?

400
00:26:47,064 --> 00:26:48,982
I can't hold on to you
while I'm flying.

401
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:53,737
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

402
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:55,280
- We're gonna die!
- Hold on!

403
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:57,241
Hold on! I'm thinking,
I'm thinking!

404
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:59,493
Wait, I have an idea.

405
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:00,702
Grab on to me!

406
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:06,083
This had better work!

407
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:09,962
- Oh, it's cool. It's Carol.

408
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:17,719
Okay, no powers,
no powers. Just...

409
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,358
Who are they?

410
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:35,028
They are associates
of Captain Marvel.

411
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:39,283
The Annihilator is here?

412
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:40,617
Yeah, well, she was.

413
00:27:40,701 --> 00:27:43,078
And then these two
just sort of appeared.

414
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:44,371
What about the band?

415
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:46,039
If she's meddling,
I need to strike now.

416
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:48,250
Yeah. I still can't
account for the instabilities

417
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,585
exhibited on MB-418.

418
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,628
This thing does much more
than just...

419
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:52,880
But it works?

420
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:56,008
Yes. Yes.
But if you give me more time,

421
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,843
- I can make it safer.
- No.

422
00:27:57,926 --> 00:27:59,845
No. We do it now.

423
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:03,140
Before the Annihilator appears.

424
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:22,910
Uh, what should we do about...

425
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:24,786
these two?

426
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,385
You.

427
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:44,097
- Hold that thought.

428
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:15,003
We gotta get
that band off of her.

429
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:16,421
It looks like mine.

430
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:18,131
Guys!

431
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:29,851
I can't fly.

432
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:33,480
Do you guys have a spaceship
I could borrow or...

433
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:35,065
- Kamala, don't talk to them.

434
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:36,692
You know my name!

435
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:48,912
The Kree came here hopeful

436
00:29:48,996 --> 00:29:51,415
that we could build
a covenant of peace.

437
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:52,541
What have you done?

438
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:56,378
But then you sic the Annihilator on us.

439
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:59,548
Like we're vermin.

440
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:05,178
Once again, the Skrull
have betrayed the Kree.

441
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:07,431
And for that...

442
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,083
Carol, we gotta get
these people out of here.

443
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,127
Emperor Dro'ge,

444
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,421
you need to evacuate your people now.

445
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:43,050
We have nowhere to go.

446
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,200
Carol, the ships...

447
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:12,996
they're not gonna make it.

448
00:31:14,915 --> 00:31:16,917
Get back to the ship
and don't use your powers.

449
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,543
- But I can help.
- Now.

450
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:16,435
- Let's go.
- Where's Kamala?

451
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:20,188
Kamala!

452
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:33,326
No!

453
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:44,421
Let's go, let's go!

454
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,016
Come on!

455
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:57,517
Keep moving,

456
00:32:57,601 --> 00:32:59,186
please, please.

457
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:03,857
All these people, they're gonna...

458
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,192
- Come on, sweetie.
- No! How can you

459
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:06,359
- just leave them here?
- Kamala, now!

460
00:33:06,443 --> 00:33:08,236
We need to save who we can.

461
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:49,486
<i>Transmission sent.</i>

462
00:33:56,618 --> 00:33:57,619
Hey.

463
00:33:57,953 --> 00:33:59,204
This peace treaty,

464
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:01,248
it was a good thing.

465
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:04,709
- It was a ruse.
- If it were,

466
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:07,462
your intervention failed.

467
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:11,132
We don't need your help anymore.

468
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:16,137
I called a friend.

469
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:17,681
She can find a safe place for you.

470
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,267
Is that okay?

471
00:34:21,101 --> 00:34:22,686
We have no choice.

472
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,232
- Incoming.

473
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:42,414
Are you all right?

474
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,753
Thank you again.

475
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:50,714
Always.

476
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:53,091
I see that you've finally
found yourself a team.

477
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:54,259
It is unintentional.

478
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,553
Oh, I've been on some
unintentional teams myself.

479
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:59,139
- I know, but...
- You can stand tall

480
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:00,849
without standing alone.

481
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:04,644
Take it from me, Marv.

482
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:13,945
Hey.

483
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,906
Captain Marvel will fix this.

484
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:19,034
I promise.

485
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:34,716
Thank you.

486
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:40,513
May our next meeting be joyful.

487
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:23,556
Breathe.

488
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:37,696
Do you remember?

489
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:42,033
When the sun used to shine on Hala?

490
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:45,870
<i>How beautiful our home was?</i>

491
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,250
<i>Before her?</i>

492
00:36:56,423 --> 00:36:58,383
<i>Before the Annihilator.</i>

493
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:02,554
<i>I was there.</i>

494
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:11,020
<i>I heard her lies,</i>

495
00:37:11,813 --> 00:37:14,023
<i>claiming she was there to set us free.</i>

496
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:18,737
<i>But when she destroyed
the Supreme Intelligence,</i>

497
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:21,406
<i>- she destroyed the Kree.</i>

498
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:32,125
For 30 years, I have been
fighting alongside you.

499
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:35,128
Not only have
I brought you peace,

500
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:39,215
but I have found a way
to return Hala to glory.

501
00:37:39,299 --> 00:37:41,301
- Supremor!

502
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:43,386
- Supremor!

503
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:47,974
We need more power
than that band can provide

504
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:49,809
if we're to reignite our sun.

505
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:51,728
That amount of energy...

506
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,229
Well, it would kill you.

507
00:37:54,147 --> 00:37:55,732
If my life is the cost, so be it.

508
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:57,692
We will find the other
in time, Suprem...

509
00:37:57,776 --> 00:37:59,402
There is no more time.

510
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,114
Hala is out of time.

511
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,888
Need a hand?

512
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:31,726
Yeah.

513
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:45,782
Will you hand me that laser?
Three micrometres.

514
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:51,538
Wow.

515
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:54,666
So you can do that because you
walked through a witch hex?

516
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,209
Yep.

517
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:57,502
When I got blipped back,

518
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,879
they weren't sending us
to space anymore.

519
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:03,091
Grounded us to investigate
earthbound anomalies.

520
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:05,051
That must have been hard.

521
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:06,261
Your mom told me that you

522
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,263
always dreamed of going to space.

523
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:09,639
That you had something to prove.

524
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:11,724
You said you'd be back before I knew it.

525
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:13,977
What?

526
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:15,728
When you left,

527
00:39:16,563 --> 00:39:19,482
you said you'd be back
before I knew it.

528
00:39:21,943 --> 00:39:24,821
I meant what I said.
I just, I didn't know

529
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:27,657
what I was getting myself into.

530
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:30,243
I didn't know how to explain
to a little girl that...

531
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:34,163
A little girl that hung
on your every word.

532
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:39,586
If you knew...

533
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,797
I was going to come back.

534
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:44,132
I just...

535
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:46,801
There was people that needed me.

536
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:49,387
We needed you, Carol.

537
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:09,657
Hey.

538
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:10,742
I hope you don't mind.

539
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,076
I didn't have any other clothes.

540
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,786
It's totally fine.

541
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:15,330
Looks good on you.

542
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:19,208
I, um...

543
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,628
I'm really sorry

544
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:22,837
for the way I spoke to you.

545
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:25,798
Thank you.

546
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:30,303
I know that this situation isn't ideal,

547
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:33,222
but it is actually nice

548
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:35,892
having people on board again.

549
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,979
It gets pretty lonely out here.

550
00:40:40,063 --> 00:40:42,190
Anytime you need company,
I will be there.

551
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:43,775
I will drop everything. I will...

552
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:45,234
I will drop high school.

553
00:40:45,318 --> 00:40:46,819
Don't do that.

554
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:49,030
But can we start again?

555
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:53,493
Hi, I'm Carol Danvers.

556
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:56,579
I am Kamala Khan.

557
00:40:56,663 --> 00:40:58,581
But when I'm fighting crime
on the streets of Jersey City,

558
00:40:58,665 --> 00:41:00,500
I go by Ms. Marvel,
and I hope that's okay,

559
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:01,793
like, copyright-wise.
Because, honestly,

560
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:03,086
I never thought
I'd ever get to meet you.

561
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:04,170
But now that it's happening

562
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:05,338
and we're, like, touching each other...

563
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:07,131
I've realized I should
have asked permission.

564
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:08,967
So,

565
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:11,594
twinsies.

566
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:14,514
Okay. All right.

567
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:16,474
Here's what we're gonna do.

568
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:17,558
Captain Marvel.

569
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:18,643
You need to stop calling me that.

570
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:19,727
I used to change your diapers.

571
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:20,812
Oh, that was once.

572
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:22,355
And then I was told you
proceeded to vomit everywhere.

573
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:25,233
First of all, it's my ship,
so I make the game plan.

574
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:27,318
Oh, I'm sorry. When's the
last time you led a team?

575
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:29,821
- As early as last week.
- Goose doesn't count.

576
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:31,280
Please. You try giving Goose orders.

577
00:41:31,364 --> 00:41:32,365
Oh, my God, we're a team?

578
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:33,449
- We're not...
- Oh, no, no, no,

579
00:41:33,533 --> 00:41:34,575
- we're not a team.
- We're not a team.

580
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:38,204
I, Kamala Khan of Jersey City,

581
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:39,706
am on a team with Captain Marvel

582
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:41,582
and Captain Monica Rambeau,

583
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:44,168
who from this point onwards
will now be known as...

584
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,296
- Professor Marvel.
- Oh!

585
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,298
Professor Marvel.

586
00:41:49,382 --> 00:41:51,300
No. No, no, she...
she will not.

587
00:41:51,384 --> 00:41:53,094
- But thank you.
- The Marvels.

588
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:55,179
Now that we've got that
out of the way, team,

589
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:56,347
I've been trying to tell you,

590
00:41:56,431 --> 00:41:58,433
I think I know how she's
making the weird jump points.

591
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,601
She has one of these.

592
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:02,979
<i>It's my nani's bangle.</i>

593
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:05,606
It started glowing really weirdly

594
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:08,234
when Dar-Benn opened
that first jump point. Also,

595
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:11,320
it once traveled me
through space and time,

596
00:42:11,404 --> 00:42:13,114
so that's probably related.

597
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:15,908
What you're describing
is a Quantum Band.

598
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:17,702
I mean, I knew
there were two of these.

599
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:19,787
I just did not expect
the other one to be in space.

600
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:23,166
They're a pair? How do
you have a Quantum Band?

601
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:24,709
Okay. What is a Quantum Band?

602
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:27,086
A myth. Or I thought it was a myth.

603
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:28,880
It's an ancient artifact.

604
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:32,633
So this is what
Dar-Benn found on MB-418.

605
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:33,718
And then her and Kamala

606
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:35,386
just happened to stumble into each other?

607
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:37,263
I mean, what are the chances?

608
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:39,265
"What you seek is seeking you."

609
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:41,726
It's inscribed on the bangle.

610
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,770
If the Kree legends are true,

611
00:42:43,853 --> 00:42:45,605
the Quantum Bands
were used to create

612
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:47,774
every jump point in the universe.

613
00:42:47,857 --> 00:42:48,983
Teleportation network.

614
00:42:49,442 --> 00:42:53,237
Two Quantum Bands working
in unison to connect the galaxy.

615
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:54,614
So that would explain

616
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,783
our switch-y entanglement situation.

617
00:42:56,866 --> 00:42:59,827
Yeah, yeah, but Dar-Benn only has one.

618
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:02,497
She must be overloading it
with the energy

619
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,040
from her space hammer thingy.

620
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:05,208
It's called the Universal Weapon.

621
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:07,710
Oh, really?
I was gonna call it Cosmi-Rod.

622
00:43:07,794 --> 00:43:10,004
Either way, she's using it to force

623
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:11,923
unstable jump points into the grid.

624
00:43:12,465 --> 00:43:15,009
We have got to get to her
before she makes another one.

625
00:43:15,468 --> 00:43:17,678
She had star charts and maps
on the screens on her ship.

626
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:20,098
Okay. To where?

627
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:22,975
- To the stars?
- Okay.

628
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:25,561
It's fine. Got a plan.

629
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:27,605
We will use this.

630
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:29,857
- Is that...?
- A Skrull torture device.

631
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:32,235
And, wait, we put it on our heads?

632
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:36,072
Yes, it's fine.
You use it to access memories.

633
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:37,990
I've been using it

634
00:43:38,074 --> 00:43:40,451
to regain the memories
that the Kree took from me.

635
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:42,703
Still?

636
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:44,163
Yeah.

637
00:43:44,247 --> 00:43:46,040
But, you know,
it has a lot of other uses.

638
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:47,875
- It's safe.

639
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:49,836
You might wanna get comfortable.

640
00:43:56,676 --> 00:43:58,845
<i>Whoa! This is weird.</i>

641
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:01,180
<i>Wait. Go back.</i>

642
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:06,185
<i>Her band absorbs your energy
and redirects it.</i>

643
00:44:06,269 --> 00:44:09,689
<i>It's like you gave her power
to use against you.</i>

644
00:44:11,232 --> 00:44:12,233
<i>Kamala?</i>

645
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:15,153
<i>Hmm. What about this?</i>

646
00:44:15,236 --> 00:44:16,863
<i>There! Those coordinates.</i>

647
00:44:16,946 --> 00:44:18,197
<i>- Can you read that?
- Yes.</i>

648
00:44:18,281 --> 00:44:19,991
<i>The Magellanic Galaxy.</i>

649
00:44:21,868 --> 00:44:23,161
- All right,

650
00:44:23,244 --> 00:44:24,328
the pilot seat's all you.

651
00:44:24,412 --> 00:44:27,540
<i>Is that you, Monica?
You're so cute!</i>

652
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:30,042
<i>No, wait.</i>

653
00:44:30,126 --> 00:44:31,210
<i>Carol, what are you doing?</i>

654
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:36,424
Why'd you ask me
to come, Maria?

655
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:37,800
<i>Mom.</i>

656
00:44:39,594 --> 00:44:41,053
The cancer's back.

657
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:44,432
So I need you to take care of Goose.

658
00:44:46,309 --> 00:44:47,685
- No.
- What do you mean "no?"

659
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:49,562
No, I mean, you beat it once.
You'll beat it again.

660
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:50,730
Carol...

661
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:53,482
- I'm not taking the cat.
- It's not a cat.

662
00:44:55,568 --> 00:44:57,403
It should've been you that day.

663
00:44:58,279 --> 00:45:00,281
That stupid race to the hangar.

664
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:02,658
I never wanted to be Captain Marvel.

665
00:45:03,326 --> 00:45:05,828
Captain Rambeau suits me just fine.

666
00:45:06,287 --> 00:45:08,915
And it's just until Monica gets back.

667
00:45:11,459 --> 00:45:12,710
She blipped.

668
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:14,212
<i>Carol, I don't wanna relive this.</i>

669
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:15,588
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

670
00:45:19,884 --> 00:45:21,636
<i>Stop now, please, Carol!</i>

671
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:23,679
Remember why you're out there.

672
00:45:23,763 --> 00:45:25,014
I'm looking for a patient in room 104.

673
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:26,390
I don't know.
I don't know what to tell you.

674
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:28,142
And remember to come home.

675
00:45:28,476 --> 00:45:30,436
<i>Your mom,
she died, honey.</i>

676
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:32,730
No. No, no, no!

677
00:45:37,485 --> 00:45:38,569
Never do that again.

678
00:45:38,653 --> 00:45:40,529
I'm sorry. It wasn't on purpose.

679
00:45:40,613 --> 00:45:41,739
Wait, so your mom...

680
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:44,325
Passed away while I was blipped.

681
00:45:45,201 --> 00:45:46,202
And when I came back,

682
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:48,120
no one was there.

683
00:45:54,335 --> 00:45:55,920
Okay.

684
00:46:02,969 --> 00:46:04,762
Thank you.

685
00:46:07,932 --> 00:46:10,184
She seemed really cool. I'm sorry.

686
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:11,936
She was.

687
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:13,604
She was the best.

688
00:46:16,107 --> 00:46:19,068
Well, we have to make do
with what we know right now.

689
00:46:20,069 --> 00:46:22,196
Here is what we do know.

690
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,323
The Universal Neural
Teleportation Network

691
00:46:24,407 --> 00:46:25,700
is a system of wormholes

692
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:26,826
through the space-time continuum

693
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:28,119
aka, jump points,

694
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:30,913
which allows us to hop between
different planetary systems.

695
00:46:30,997 --> 00:46:33,374
Basically, it stretches
and reconfigures space

696
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:34,750
without rupturing the continuum.

697
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:37,962
Like fracking, the more holes you drill,

698
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:40,256
the more destabilized
the shale becomes,

699
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:41,716
and then... earthquake.

700
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:46,220
Bottom line, if she keeps
creating these jump points,

701
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:48,306
it's gonna get really bad, really fast.

702
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:50,766
Question is, what does she want?

703
00:46:51,726 --> 00:46:54,145
Tarnax used to be occupied by the Kree,

704
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:56,397
so maybe the attack was a warning?

705
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,649
So, she could be after
another former colony?

706
00:46:58,733 --> 00:47:00,318
Is there a former Kree colony
in the Magellanic?

707
00:47:00,401 --> 00:47:02,028
At one point, the Kree colonized

708
00:47:02,111 --> 00:47:04,613
25% of the galaxy, so...

709
00:47:04,697 --> 00:47:06,699
If all she wanted was to destroy Tarnax,

710
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:09,327
why not bring in an army
or use a bomb or something?

711
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:10,453
Why a jump point?

712
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:12,288
You're right.
Jump points aren't weapons,

713
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:13,622
they're means of transportation.

714
00:47:13,706 --> 00:47:15,458
Every jump point has two sides,

715
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:17,918
so if Tarnax's atmosphere
was siphoned away,

716
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:20,755
- it had to go somewhere, or...
- Hala.

717
00:47:22,882 --> 00:47:23,883
The Kree Civil War

718
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:26,510
basically bankrupted Hala
of its natural resources.

719
00:47:26,594 --> 00:47:27,678
The air is barely breathable,

720
00:47:27,762 --> 00:47:28,763
they're suffering from a drought.

721
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:29,847
A drought?

722
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:32,058
So, she could be after water next.

723
00:47:32,141 --> 00:47:34,852
Okay. Where in the Magellanic
can we find...

724
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:36,354
Aladna.

725
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:40,066
Oceans cover 99.63% of the planet.

726
00:47:40,149 --> 00:47:42,985
That is a very specific stat.
You've been there.

727
00:47:45,321 --> 00:47:46,364
Yeah.

728
00:47:46,447 --> 00:47:48,074
Uh... Uh, yeah.

729
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:52,370
She said that really weird.

730
00:47:52,453 --> 00:47:53,454
Yeah. Why are you being weird?

731
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:56,332
Okay. Consensus on Aladna.

732
00:47:57,583 --> 00:48:00,127
- Aye.
- Yeah, I say we do it.

733
00:48:00,211 --> 00:48:03,089
Get to Aladna and separate
Dar-Benn from that bangle.

734
00:48:03,172 --> 00:48:04,799
We have our heading.

735
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:05,966
<i>Kamala,</i>

736
00:48:06,467 --> 00:48:09,512
<i>you are not going
on any space adventures.</i>

737
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:12,348
<i>Nicholas has told me
how dangerous they can be.</i>

738
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:14,433
It's just "Fury." God.

739
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:16,560
<i>Wait. Where are you guys?
Where is Abu?</i>

740
00:48:17,228 --> 00:48:20,648
Hell.
This man has taken us to Hell.

741
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:24,693
Hell?
So that means I'm the devil?

742
00:48:24,777 --> 00:48:27,488
<i>- Really, Fury?
- They insisted,</i>

743
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:30,116
and your dad is not adjusting
very well to space travel.

744
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:32,743
Hey, babe, so I'm in
this crazy space elevator

745
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:33,994
and we're going up.

746
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:37,415
Or maybe we're going down. Uh...

747
00:48:37,498 --> 00:48:38,833
<i>Are there directions in space?</i>

748
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:40,167
<i>Yes, there are.</i>

749
00:48:40,251 --> 00:48:41,502
But no filming.

750
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:43,212
Oh. Okay.

751
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:45,256
Help me.

752
00:48:46,215 --> 00:48:47,425
- Whoa.

753
00:48:54,974 --> 00:48:57,017
<i>Fury, everything okay?</i>

754
00:48:57,101 --> 00:48:58,310
We've had another surge.

755
00:48:58,394 --> 00:49:00,396
Reports are coming in
across the network.

756
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:02,106
It seems everyone's been affected.

757
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:04,900
<i>Well, we need to stop
her from making another one,</i>

758
00:49:04,984 --> 00:49:06,444
and we can't risk
intergalactic body swapping

759
00:49:06,527 --> 00:49:07,528
in the meantime.

760
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:09,280
<i>Mrs. Khan, I'm sorry,</i>

761
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:10,990
<i>but your daughter will have
to stay aboard my ship</i>

762
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:12,074
<i>until we can get to the bottom of this.</i>

763
00:49:12,158 --> 00:49:13,784
<i>Oh, no, no, no.
Yes!</i>

764
00:49:13,868 --> 00:49:15,244
<i>You will let her go.</i>

765
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:18,664
Mrs. Khan, uh, it is not that simple.

766
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:20,332
We need Kamala.

767
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,460
<i>Ammi, we found Nani's other bangle,</i>

768
00:49:22,543 --> 00:49:23,544
<i>and there's this weirdly beautiful</i>

769
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:24,628
<i>but kind of terrifying woman</i>

770
00:49:24,712 --> 00:49:25,713
<i>using the other one to hurt people.</i>

771
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:26,797
<i>And we have to stop her.</i>

772
00:49:26,881 --> 00:49:28,132
<i>You're telling me
there's another bangle.</i>

773
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:30,968
<i>And they're going to use
that bangle to hurt you?</i>

774
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:32,136
Monica will take care of her.

775
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:33,637
<i>We will. And we will make sure</i>

776
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:35,431
<i>she gets back home in one piece.</i>

777
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:36,640
<i>I promise.</i>

778
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:38,350
<i>Stay the course.</i>

779
00:49:38,434 --> 00:49:40,895
<i>We'll figure out how to close
those jump points.</i>

780
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:43,522
Kamala, you listen to me.

781
00:49:43,606 --> 00:49:44,940
<i>If anything happens to you,</i>

782
00:49:45,149 --> 00:49:46,734
I will kill her.

783
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:48,110
<i>You tell her that.</i>

784
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:51,447
<i>I love you, beta.</i>

785
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:52,531
I love you more.

786
00:49:52,615 --> 00:49:53,782
Wait, what did she just say?

787
00:49:53,866 --> 00:49:54,909
Nothing.

788
00:49:55,743 --> 00:49:58,662
Nobody cares more than Captain Marvel,

789
00:49:58,746 --> 00:50:00,206
and nobody gets more grief for it.

790
00:50:00,289 --> 00:50:03,375
Trust me. Kamala is
in good hands with Carol.

791
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:09,131
What's wrong with that cat?

792
00:50:10,049 --> 00:50:11,592
It's acting very weird.

793
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:14,470
Also, Mr. Fury,
she's looking little pudgy.

794
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:16,722
I think you're overfeeding her.

795
00:50:18,474 --> 00:50:19,475
Goose.

796
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:24,813
Goose!

797
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:28,192
Firefly? Night Light.

798
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:30,027
Countess Marvel. Mistress Marvel?

799
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:31,487
- Doctor Marvel?
- That's too much.

800
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:32,821
Doctor Bright.

801
00:50:32,905 --> 00:50:35,074
Mmm... Professor Marvel.

802
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:36,992
Nova, Supernova Girl...

803
00:50:37,076 --> 00:50:38,327
- Spectrum, Spectrum-Vision.
- You're doing too much.

804
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:40,496
Vision! Oh, wait. No. Sorry.

805
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:42,623
How many times do I have to
tell you guys, I do not want

806
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:44,625
- or need a code name?
- Why?

807
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:47,378
Besides, none of it matters
if we're not coordinated out there.

808
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:48,546
Wanna figure out
the switching thing?

809
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:53,759
Powers stay activated
after a switch. Good to know.

810
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:55,928
Okay, everyone together on three.

811
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:58,264
Ready? One, two, three, go.

812
00:50:59,265 --> 00:51:01,267
Now, why would you say "go"

And switch!

830
00:51:48,606 --> 00:51:51,191
That's why you wanna
invest in index funds

831
00:51:51,275 --> 00:51:52,693
rather than in individual stocks.

832
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:55,237
Of course, both a Roth IRA and 401 k

833
00:51:55,321 --> 00:51:57,323
are important for tax purposes.

834
00:51:57,406 --> 00:51:59,700
You know, I never even thought
about planning for retirement.

Hey, it's never too late.

What is it?

845
00:52:22,348 --> 00:52:24,099
I haven't the foggiest idea.

846
00:52:24,183 --> 00:52:25,184
How did it get in there?

847
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:26,310
I don't know.

848
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:29,438
Should we tell Fury?

849

Do you guys realize
how crazy this is right now?

852
00:52:35,319 --> 00:52:37,446
Like, I'm in a spaceship
with two superheroes.

853
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:39,031
Also, is it too late
to go to the bathroom?

854
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:40,366
Because I feel like
it's gonna hit really soon.

00:52:40,449 --> 00:52:41,659
No one would believe me.

Okay. Here we go. Comms.

00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:43,220
Wow!

859
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:44,430
I've always wanted one of these.

860
00:53:44,513 --> 00:53:45,723
Thank you.

861

We hear you, baby. Thank you.

864

So, uh, real quick
before we get sucked in...

865
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:56,233
What the hell is that?

866
00:53:56,817 --> 00:54:00,195
I should warn you that
I'm kind of famous here.

867
00:54:00,571 --> 00:54:03,031
Well, you do know you're
famous everywhere, right?

868
00:54:03,115 --> 00:54:04,450
This one's kinda different.

869
00:54:04,533 --> 00:54:06,869
I helped the prince with a legal issue.

870
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:07,953
Okay.

871
00:54:08,036 --> 00:54:09,288
Mmm-hmm. Let's go.

874
00:54:11,749 --> 00:54:14,001
Aladnean culture is very specific.

875
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:16,503
So, there's gonna be a bit
of a ceremony we have to do,

It's a technicality.

Carol. What is happening?

889
00:54:53,457 --> 00:54:54,541
Their language is Song.

Most of them won't understand
you unless you sing.

That you're a pretty, pretty princess?

911
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:45,843
So, that's what you meant

when you said "legal issue."

913
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:49,513
Mmm. It is a marriage of convenience.

914
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:51,223
It's more of a diplomatic act, you know?

915
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:53,684
It's like, there was a power struggle.

00:58:56,450 --> 00:58:58,368
At best,
a one-off pest problem.

978
00:58:59,661 --> 00:59:02,247
At worst, an enemy plant.

979
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:04,583
Some kinda infestation bioweapon.

980
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:07,085
Or it could be from a traitor from within.

981
00:59:07,169 --> 00:59:11,882
Well, let's not go there yet.
This egg you say...

982
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:13,842
let's just continue to study it,

983
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:15,385
- and if anything...

984
00:59:15,469 --> 00:59:16,553
<i>Warning.</i>

985
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:18,805
<i>Twenty-nine new objects detected.</i>

986
00:59:22,184 --> 00:59:23,185
Oh, my God.

987
00:59:26,063 --> 00:59:27,731
What about Lady of Light?

988
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:29,441
Ooh. Frequency.
No.

989
00:59:29,524 --> 00:59:30,525
Pulsar.
No.

990
00:59:30,609 --> 00:59:31,902
Pulsar Light Lady.

991
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:34,112
Absolutely not. These...
These are too much, right?

992
00:59:34,196 --> 00:59:35,197
Definitely.
No.

993
00:59:45,665 --> 00:59:47,751
We make this quick.
Nothing grandiose.

994
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:50,462
You three need to disappear.
But stay close.

995
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:51,546
My specialty.

996
00:59:58,720 --> 00:59:59,721
This will work, Yan.

997
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:02,974
Remember, we wanna keep

998
01:00:03,058 --> 01:00:04,559
unintentional switching to a minimum.

999
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:07,479
Entertain her as long as you possibly can.

1000
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:09,147
Monica and I will get the jump on her.

1001
01:00:09,231 --> 01:00:10,232
And we'll get the bangle.

1002
01:00:13,944 --> 01:00:15,070
It's time.

1003
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:19,718
Supremor, why have you come?

1004
01:01:19,801 --> 01:01:22,095
I've come here to pardon you

1005
01:01:22,179 --> 01:01:24,472
for your crimes against the Kree Empire.

1006
01:01:25,223 --> 01:01:26,308
Kneel.

1007
01:01:26,725 --> 01:01:27,726
To you?

1008
01:01:28,727 --> 01:01:29,853
Hmm.

1009
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:32,189
- I will never kneel.
- Okay.

1010
01:02:00,634 --> 01:02:01,760
Damn it!

1011
01:02:25,283 --> 01:02:26,284
Use your scarf.

1012
01:02:44,636 --> 01:02:45,637
Go!

1013
01:02:54,729 --> 01:02:55,897
I found her.

1014
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:14,082
Monica, where are you?

1015
01:03:20,588 --> 01:03:21,715
Monica, tag me in.

1016
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:23,133
<i>One, two...</i>

1017
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:25,051
Don't do this.

1018
01:03:25,135 --> 01:03:26,553
You're too late.

1019
01:04:05,633 --> 01:04:06,926
Where did you get that?

1020
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:09,971
My grandma,
she sent it to me in the mail.

1021
01:04:11,598 --> 01:04:13,641
- Give it to me.
- Kamala, run.

1022
01:04:14,351 --> 01:04:15,352
Get to the ship.

1023
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:31,910
With this,
your powers only make me stronger.

1024
01:04:56,226 --> 01:04:57,227
The surges are frying our systems.

1025
01:04:57,310 --> 01:04:58,895
Are we doing something about these?

1026
01:04:58,978 --> 01:05:00,188
The space elevator's offline.

1027
01:05:00,271 --> 01:05:01,648
You ever come in here with good news?

1028
01:05:03,108 --> 01:05:04,818
Half the evacuation pods just went down.

1029
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:07,028
That's not good news.

1030
01:05:40,812 --> 01:05:41,896
<i>Are you guys in?</i>

1031
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:43,022
In.

1032
01:05:44,732 --> 01:05:46,609
Redirect all fighters.

1033
01:05:57,871 --> 01:05:59,581
Disengaging autopilot.

1034
01:06:05,462 --> 01:06:07,547
Oh, my God.
Okay, here we go. Here we go.

1035
01:06:11,634 --> 01:06:12,635
Monica?

1036
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:16,681
Monica, we're going down,
Monica!

1037
01:06:20,018 --> 01:06:21,394
I thought you could drive this thing!

1038
01:06:21,478 --> 01:06:22,604
Carol! Get down here.

1039
01:06:23,021 --> 01:06:24,105
<i>Hold that thought.</i>

1040
01:06:24,189 --> 01:06:25,190
Can you believe this woman?

1041
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:33,907
O, Captain! My Captain!

1042
01:06:42,582 --> 01:06:44,876
- No, no, no, no!
- Move over.

1043
01:06:54,093 --> 01:06:55,720
I'm activating a jump point.

1044
01:06:55,803 --> 01:06:56,804
No, I can lose her.

1045
01:06:56,888 --> 01:06:58,223
And what about the other 20 ships?

1046
01:06:58,306 --> 01:06:59,307
I can do this.

1047
01:07:05,146 --> 01:07:06,231
<i>Missile lock.</i>

1048
01:07:06,314 --> 01:07:08,233
<i>- Guys?
- Missile lock.</i>

1049
01:07:18,117 --> 01:07:19,786
<i>Incoming missiles.</i>

1050
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:21,538
<i>- Impact in five...
- We need to leave now.</i>

1051
01:07:21,621 --> 01:07:22,622
I can't let this happen again.

1052
01:07:22,705 --> 01:07:23,706
<i>- It already has.
- ...four, three, two...</i>

1053
01:07:23,790 --> 01:07:24,791
I can do this.

1054
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:26,125
And you'll kill us trying.

1055
01:07:26,209 --> 01:07:27,627
<i>Jump point activated.</i>

1056
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:49,857
We left Aladna
to fend for themselves.

1057
01:07:49,941 --> 01:07:51,401
Dar-Benn was
gonna get my bangle.

1058
01:07:51,484 --> 01:07:53,695
So I made a tough call
like you did on Tarnax.

1059
01:07:53,778 --> 01:07:55,071
Don't try to be like me.

1060
01:07:55,154 --> 01:07:56,739
I messed this whole thing up.

1061
01:07:56,823 --> 01:07:57,865
If we weren't entangled,

1062
01:07:57,949 --> 01:07:59,951
if we weren't here, then
you could have beat Dar-Benn.

1063
01:08:00,034 --> 01:08:01,160
And I'm sorry.

1064
01:08:03,454 --> 01:08:05,873
No, you don't understand.

1065
01:08:05,957 --> 01:08:09,586
The Kree had been ruled
by an AI for a millennia

1066
01:08:09,669 --> 01:08:11,045
that led them into a war.

1067
01:08:11,129 --> 01:08:14,382
And I thought the only way
to stop it was to destroy it.

1068
01:08:15,425 --> 01:08:16,467
But I just

1069
01:08:17,343 --> 01:08:18,678
made it worse.

1070
01:08:20,221 --> 01:08:21,222
I'm the reason why

1071
01:08:21,306 --> 01:08:22,807
the civil war started
in the first place.

1072
01:08:22,890 --> 01:08:25,727
I'm the reason why
they couldn't breathe the air.

1073
01:08:26,352 --> 01:08:28,313
That's how I got the name Annihilator.

1074
01:08:30,064 --> 01:08:33,026
And I never wanted you to see
that version of me.

1075
01:08:36,237 --> 01:08:38,489
Is that why you never came back?

1076
01:08:39,073 --> 01:08:40,533
I thought if I fixed it,

1077
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:42,869
then I could come home.

1078
01:08:43,661 --> 01:08:44,746
Carol.

1079
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:48,875
That's not how family works.

1080
01:08:50,543 --> 01:08:54,255
I never expected you to be
the mighty Captain Marvel.

1081
01:08:56,007 --> 01:08:57,550
I just wanted you.

1082
01:08:59,344 --> 01:09:00,678
My aunt.

1083
01:09:06,351 --> 01:09:08,102
I'm really glad that you're here now.

1084
01:09:15,193 --> 01:09:16,694
And you, too.

1085
01:09:17,737 --> 01:09:19,322
I'm glad to be here.

1086
01:09:20,114 --> 01:09:21,574
I hope that goes without saying.

1087
01:09:21,658 --> 01:09:24,035
And I am sorry

1088
01:09:24,118 --> 01:09:26,245
for coming on too strong at the beginning.

1089
01:09:26,329 --> 01:09:28,164
I did not give you a lot of space
to be a real person.

1090
01:09:33,461 --> 01:09:34,837
We have to find her.

1091
01:09:34,921 --> 01:09:36,547
I mean, but she could be anywhere.

1092
01:09:36,631 --> 01:09:38,966
No, not anywhere.

1093
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:42,095
She's targeting the people
that I care about

1094
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:44,889
and stealing resources
from every place I call home.

1095
01:09:45,682 --> 01:09:47,183
We have to warn Fury.

1096
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:55,733
<i>This is an emergency.</i>

1097
01:09:55,817 --> 01:09:57,694
<i>All S.A.B.E.R. personnel must report</i>

1098
01:09:57,777 --> 01:10:00,071
<i>to an evacuation pod immediately.</i>

1099
01:10:00,154 --> 01:10:01,239
<i>Walk. Do not run.</i>

1100
01:10:01,322 --> 01:10:02,907
We only have one evacuation bay online.

1101
01:10:02,990 --> 01:10:04,158
Which means that all we have left

1102
01:10:04,242 --> 01:10:06,619
to evacuate 350 personnel
are 15 escape pods

1103
01:10:06,703 --> 01:10:08,162
which seat five, 10, if we squeeze.

1104
01:10:08,246 --> 01:10:10,081
- It's nowhere near enough.
- Well, fill the remaining ones

1105
01:10:10,164 --> 01:10:11,582
with as many people as you can,

1106
01:10:11,666 --> 01:10:12,959
then come up with a Plan B.

1107
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:14,085
<i>This is an emergency.</i>

1108
01:10:14,168 --> 01:10:15,169
<i>All S.A.B.E.R...</i>

1109
01:10:24,804 --> 01:10:26,556
No, no, no.

1110
01:10:27,473 --> 01:10:29,267
Aamir. Go help them.
Okay, okay. Okay.

1111
01:10:31,769 --> 01:10:33,396
- I got this.

1112
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:39,068
- My living room.

1113
01:10:39,485 --> 01:10:41,070
- Goose?

1114
01:10:52,582 --> 01:10:54,959
- Goose, how'd you...

1115
01:10:55,710 --> 01:10:58,546
- Come here. Come. Come on.

1116
01:10:58,629 --> 01:11:01,382
Yes. Yes. Come here. Look at you.

1117
01:11:02,133 --> 01:11:04,093
- Oh. Look!

1118
01:11:04,677 --> 01:11:05,678
Oh, no, not my good eye!

1119
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:07,054
Whoa!

1120
01:11:07,889 --> 01:11:09,599
We only have
one escape pod left.

1121
01:11:10,183 --> 01:11:11,184
We're doomed.

1122
01:11:12,852 --> 01:11:14,270
In the end,

1123
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:17,106
none of us choose how
we transition from this life

1124
01:11:17,648 --> 01:11:18,941
to the next.

1125
01:11:19,025 --> 01:11:20,818
What? No!

1126
01:11:20,902 --> 01:11:23,529
Get everyone
to the evacuation deck. Now!

1127
01:11:30,661 --> 01:11:32,455
Here, kitty.
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

1128
01:11:32,538 --> 01:11:34,248
What are we doing?

1129
01:11:35,416 --> 01:11:36,459
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

1130
01:11:36,542 --> 01:11:37,919
Let's go.
Come on. Come on.

1131
01:11:38,461 --> 01:11:40,588
- I can't. Can you?
- I got it.

1132
01:11:43,549 --> 01:11:45,301
What is going on, fam?

1133
01:11:45,802 --> 01:11:46,803
Kamala?

1134
01:11:47,386 --> 01:11:48,930
Kamala! Yusuf, Kamala!

1135
01:11:49,013 --> 01:11:51,808
<i>- Ya Allah.
- Kamala! Kamala!</i>

1136
01:11:53,518 --> 01:11:54,852
<i>You're back safely, beta.</i>

1137
01:11:54,936 --> 01:11:56,145
You're not dead.

1138
01:11:56,229 --> 01:11:58,147
I've lost contact with Earth.

1139
01:11:58,231 --> 01:12:00,525
We're officially at abandon-ship phase.

1140
01:12:05,071 --> 01:12:06,155
Spit him out.

1141
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:07,532
- Spit him out.
- No, no, no.

1142
01:12:07,615 --> 01:12:09,158
No. That's the plan.

1143
01:12:10,451 --> 01:12:11,828
- That's the plan?
- It's much easier

1144
01:12:11,911 --> 01:12:15,373
to transport a family of cats
than hundreds of crew members.

1145
01:12:15,998 --> 01:12:17,291
So, we're literally herding cats?

1146
01:12:20,127 --> 01:12:21,963
<i></i>

1147
01:12:22,046 --> 01:12:23,047
Come here, kitty.

1148
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:26,133
<i>Attention, S.A.B.E.R. crew.</i>

1149
01:12:26,217 --> 01:12:29,136
<i>Stop running and let the Flerkens eat you.</i>

1150
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:31,639
<i>- You will be fine.</i>

1151
01:12:42,024 --> 01:12:43,025
<i>S.A.B.E.R. crew.</i>

1152
01:12:43,109 --> 01:12:46,070
<i>Stop running and let the Flerkens eat you.</i>

1153
01:12:47,238 --> 01:12:48,656
<i>Stop running.</i>

1154
01:12:48,739 --> 01:12:51,117
<i></i>

1155
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:04,463
I'm sorry.

1156
01:13:09,969 --> 01:13:12,346
<i>Stop running
and let the Flerkens eat you.</i>

1157
01:13:12,430 --> 01:13:14,807
<i>- Stop running.</i>

1158
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:27,194
<i></i>

1159
01:13:35,453 --> 01:13:37,121
- Guys, I found her.

1160
01:13:38,289 --> 01:13:40,499
- Come on. Come on, move.
- Hey! Come on.

1161
01:13:40,583 --> 01:13:41,709
Come on, come here.

1162
01:13:42,293 --> 01:13:43,294
Whoa!

1163
01:13:43,377 --> 01:13:45,504
Go, go, go.
Come on, come on.

1164
01:13:45,588 --> 01:13:47,798
<i>- Go to the spacecraft bay.
- Okay. Come on. Chalo, Chalo.</i>

1165
01:13:47,882 --> 01:13:50,009
Come on.
Yusuf, stop with your belt.

1166
01:14:04,065 --> 01:14:07,026
Nope. No. No, no, no.
Thank you. No.

1167
01:14:08,027 --> 01:14:09,445
Come, come, come.

1168
01:14:09,528 --> 01:14:11,864
<i></i>

1169
01:14:17,161 --> 01:14:18,204
Don't you worry, little one.

1170
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:20,706
Here, go to Kamala. Go to Kamala.

1171
01:14:23,834 --> 01:14:25,211
There you go, come, come.

1172
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:27,129
- I found Dar-Benn.
- What?

1173
01:14:28,047 --> 01:14:29,298
She wants our sun.

1174
01:14:56,909 --> 01:14:57,952
<i>You leavin' again?</i>

1175
01:14:58,828 --> 01:14:59,912
Yeah.

1176
01:15:00,454 --> 01:15:01,998
<i>Ammi, the universe isn't safe.</i>

1177
01:15:02,081 --> 01:15:03,165
And if the universe isn't safe,

1178
01:15:03,249 --> 01:15:04,250
that means you guys aren't safe.

1179
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:05,751
- And if you guys aren't...

1180
01:15:05,835 --> 01:15:07,461
Listen to me.

1181
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:11,841
You are chosen
for a greater purpose, okay?

1182
01:15:11,924 --> 01:15:13,884
So, of course you must go now.

1183
01:15:15,177 --> 01:15:17,596
But I will never let you go.

1184
01:15:18,389 --> 01:15:20,182
You understand that, right?

1185
01:15:24,812 --> 01:15:26,647
<i>- Yeah.
- Come back safely, beta.</i>

1186
01:15:26,731 --> 01:15:29,608
You better. I don't
wanna be an only child.

1187
01:15:29,692 --> 01:15:31,986
Not again. Not with these two.

1188
01:15:35,448 --> 01:15:38,492
You think it's wise taking
that bangle to the bad guy?

1189
01:15:38,576 --> 01:15:39,827
Yes. Mr. Fury's right. Give it to me.

1190
01:15:39,910 --> 01:15:40,911
I will take it home.

1191
01:15:41,829 --> 01:15:42,997
Dar-Benn's opened another jump point,

1192
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:45,249
and we're gonna need
both bangles to close it.

1193
01:15:45,332 --> 01:15:46,917
Then I guess you'd better
make damn sure

1194
01:15:47,001 --> 01:15:48,377
she doesn't get her hands on it.

1195
01:15:49,378 --> 01:15:50,504
Understood.

1196
01:16:08,939 --> 01:16:10,149
Oh, God, Mr. Fury,

1197
01:16:10,232 --> 01:16:11,859
you are going in the wrong direction!

1198
01:16:11,942 --> 01:16:13,360
Mrs. Khan, I know!

1199
01:16:16,781 --> 01:16:19,492
You did it, Mr. Fury!
I didn't do anything.

1200
01:16:23,245 --> 01:16:24,371
Are you praying?

1201
01:16:25,331 --> 01:16:27,416
Don't stop! We need
all the help we can get!

1202
01:16:28,709 --> 01:16:29,710
Amen!

1203
01:16:30,836 --> 01:16:32,046
Amen!

1204
01:16:32,129 --> 01:16:33,506
- Holy cow!

1205
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:35,841
- Mr. Fury!
- Whoa!

1206
01:17:28,435 --> 01:17:29,562
There she is,

1207
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:32,356
the Annihilator herself.

1208
01:17:32,439 --> 01:17:33,899
It's over, Dar-Benn.

1209
01:17:34,275 --> 01:17:35,526
No, not yet.

1210
01:17:35,609 --> 01:17:38,154
I know that you would do
anything to protect Hala.

1211
01:17:38,821 --> 01:17:40,489
This will be the end of the Kree.

1212
01:17:40,573 --> 01:17:42,116
It will be the end of everything.

1213
01:17:42,199 --> 01:17:45,494
You took from me.
I'm simply repaying the favor.

1214
01:17:46,495 --> 01:17:49,582
Now, give me the band.

1215
01:17:50,791 --> 01:17:52,001
You're forgetting something.

1216
01:17:52,084 --> 01:17:53,919
- What?
- Me.

1217
01:18:08,309 --> 01:18:11,312
This could have been so much easier.

1218
01:18:11,979 --> 01:18:14,565
I don't know. I like our odds.

1219
01:19:35,271 --> 01:19:37,564
You're living up to your name again.

1220
01:19:38,691 --> 01:19:40,109
I didn't want this.

1221
01:19:40,192 --> 01:19:41,986
Death seems to follow you.

1222
01:19:49,159 --> 01:19:50,911
It doesn't have to end
like this, Dar-Benn.

1223
01:19:50,995 --> 01:19:52,246
Please, just give us the bangle.

1224
01:19:52,329 --> 01:19:53,330
I won't!

1225
01:19:55,291 --> 01:19:57,710
Hala's sun died because of you.

1226
01:19:57,793 --> 01:19:59,378
Why shouldn't you repay us?

1227
01:20:01,547 --> 01:20:02,589
Maybe she should.

1228
01:20:04,466 --> 01:20:07,052
The reaction in your
sun's core has slowed.

1229
01:20:07,136 --> 01:20:09,513
It needs an incredible amount
of energy to jump-start it,

1230
01:20:09,596 --> 01:20:11,432
and that's what you have, Carol.

1231
01:20:12,433 --> 01:20:15,352
You can use your powers to save Hala.

1232
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:18,856
But I've never done anything
like that before.

1233
01:20:18,939 --> 01:20:20,024
In the last couple of days, I have done

1234
01:20:20,107 --> 01:20:21,942
a lot of things I have never done before.

1235
01:20:23,652 --> 01:20:24,862
You got this.

1236
01:20:30,576 --> 01:20:31,744
For Hala.

1237
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:37,916
For Hala.

1238
01:20:55,809 --> 01:20:57,811
Try anything and I'll kill her
faster than you can move.

1239
01:21:01,231 --> 01:21:03,484
Carol!

1240
01:21:07,821 --> 01:21:08,822
No!

1241
01:21:24,004 --> 01:21:25,255
You won't survive this.

1242
01:21:25,339 --> 01:21:27,925
Dar-Benn, listen to me.

1243
01:22:12,052 --> 01:22:13,178
Are you okay?

1244
01:22:14,513 --> 01:22:15,514
Yeah.

1245
01:22:16,974 --> 01:22:18,434
I didn't switch.

1246
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:19,935
One, two, three.

1247
01:22:45,669 --> 01:22:47,629
I'm so glad you're okay.

1248
01:22:48,547 --> 01:22:49,715
You got the bangles.

1249
01:22:52,092 --> 01:22:54,178
- We're gonna need those.

1250
01:22:55,179 --> 01:22:56,346
Ooh...

1251
01:22:56,430 --> 01:22:58,640
Okay, come on, Princess.

1252
01:23:04,229 --> 01:23:06,148
So, what are we looking at?

1253
01:23:06,231 --> 01:23:09,026
A self-propagating singularity
with negative mass

1254
01:23:09,109 --> 01:23:10,736
and non-Newtonian topology.

1255
01:23:12,613 --> 01:23:15,616
She tore a hole in space-time.

1256
01:23:18,202 --> 01:23:21,622
That is a different reality
bleeding into ours.

1257
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:23,332
Can we even fix that?

1258
01:23:23,415 --> 01:23:25,167
In theory, you and Carol

1259
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:26,793
can reproduce
the same amount of energy

1260
01:23:26,877 --> 01:23:27,920
that was used to open it.

1261
01:23:28,003 --> 01:23:29,838
I will absorb it and then release it,

1262
01:23:29,922 --> 01:23:31,340
but from inside the tear.

1263
01:23:31,423 --> 01:23:33,050
But what about the switching?

1264
01:23:33,133 --> 01:23:35,636
Our, um, powers
aren't entangled anymore.

1265
01:23:36,553 --> 01:23:37,554
Oh.

1266
01:23:39,097 --> 01:23:41,517
Well, that's a good thing, I guess.

1267
01:23:41,975 --> 01:23:44,520
But, wait. You want us to blast you

1268
01:23:44,603 --> 01:23:46,021
with the same amount of power

1269
01:23:46,104 --> 01:23:48,649
that punched a hole
in the fabric of space-time?

1270
01:23:49,608 --> 01:23:51,985
If we wanna un-punch it, yeah.

1271
01:23:53,111 --> 01:23:54,112
Monica...

1272
01:23:55,781 --> 01:23:56,865
You're gonna need this.

1273
01:24:05,457 --> 01:24:06,708
How are you feeling, Ms. Marvel?

1274
01:24:08,210 --> 01:24:10,879
These bangles traveled
through space and time.

1275
01:24:10,963 --> 01:24:12,256
To find me.

1276
01:24:14,424 --> 01:24:15,676
I was born for this.

1277
01:24:19,888 --> 01:24:21,431
It has to be now.

1278
01:24:24,810 --> 01:24:26,311
<i>Bismillaah.</i>

1279
01:25:03,807 --> 01:25:05,350
Your mom would be proud.

1280
01:25:06,268 --> 01:25:07,894
Higher, further, faster.

1281
01:25:10,147 --> 01:25:12,149
Higher, further, faster.

1282
01:26:09,790 --> 01:26:11,875
It's closing, Monica.
You've got to get out of there.

1283
01:26:11,958 --> 01:26:14,628
I can't leave, Carol.

1284
01:26:14,711 --> 01:26:16,088
<i>What? What do you mean?</i>

1285
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:17,339
I can't leave.

1286
01:26:17,422 --> 01:26:18,799
I have to finish the job.

1287
01:26:18,882 --> 01:26:20,759
No! Monica, it's closing.
You'll be trapped!

1288
01:26:21,385 --> 01:26:22,511
It's okay.

1289
01:26:40,070 --> 01:26:41,321
Come on.

1290
01:26:45,117 --> 01:26:47,035
Always knew I would have to stay.

1291
01:27:55,145 --> 01:27:56,938
<i>Ka... Kamala. Beta.</i>

1292
01:28:02,652 --> 01:28:04,446
Kamala, you saved the world.

1293
01:28:09,701 --> 01:28:11,411
<i>- Why are you crying?
- Beta?</i>

1294
01:28:11,495 --> 01:28:12,746
Why are you crying?

1295
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:18,418
What happened?

1296
01:28:19,753 --> 01:28:21,296
We lost Monica.

1297
01:28:24,549 --> 01:28:26,802
She got stuck on the other side.

1298
01:28:27,552 --> 01:28:28,720
And Carol?

1299
01:28:32,265 --> 01:28:34,100
<i>She went to fulfill a promise.</i>

1300
01:29:58,768 --> 01:29:59,978
How are things?

1301
01:30:00,395 --> 01:30:02,564
The planets are expected
to make a full recovery.

1302
01:30:03,356 --> 01:30:05,025
And a team of scientists
are being sent to Hala

1303
01:30:05,108 --> 01:30:06,234
to try and help their people.

1304
01:30:06,318 --> 01:30:07,861
That's not what I meant.

1305
01:30:31,259 --> 01:30:32,260
This says "Kitchen,"

1306
01:30:32,344 --> 01:30:34,554
but there are all these
hot sauce packets...

1307
01:30:34,638 --> 01:30:37,807
And then there's this
very bizarre-looking tray,

1308
01:30:37,891 --> 01:30:40,894
which I will say is
a very good quality, though.

1309
01:30:40,977 --> 01:30:43,063
- Oof. You can keep it.
- Oh, no, no, Carol, I just...

1310
01:30:43,146 --> 01:30:44,147
Where else would they go?

1311
01:30:44,230 --> 01:30:46,107
Oh, yeah, yeah, it was for me.

1312
01:30:46,191 --> 01:30:48,109
The vastness of it just gives you

1313
01:30:48,193 --> 01:30:50,445
a whole new perspective on life.

1314
01:30:50,528 --> 01:30:52,364
Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

1315
01:30:52,447 --> 01:30:53,823
And it was surprisingly cool.

1316
01:30:56,868 --> 01:30:59,704
This place is amazing.

1317
01:30:59,788 --> 01:31:01,373
Yeah, it is.

1318
01:31:02,999 --> 01:31:04,250
Hey, do you still fly that thing?

1319
01:31:05,085 --> 01:31:06,336
- You wanna check it out?
- I do.

1320
01:31:06,419 --> 01:31:07,462
- All right.

1321
01:31:07,545 --> 01:31:08,672
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

1322
01:31:08,755 --> 01:31:10,799
Come here. Come here.
Come here. Come here.

1323
01:31:10,882 --> 01:31:14,010
<i>Oh, I'm so happy that
you're home safe, beta.</i>

1324
01:31:14,094 --> 01:31:15,095
Okay.

1325
01:31:20,976 --> 01:31:21,977
Aamir,

1326
01:31:22,978 --> 01:31:24,104
this would be a lovely house

1327
01:31:24,187 --> 01:31:25,772
to raise a family in, you know?

1328
01:31:27,482 --> 01:31:28,650
Aamir.

1329
01:31:28,733 --> 01:31:30,777
- This is so cool.

1330
01:31:30,860 --> 01:31:32,362
Pilot seat's all you.

1331
01:31:41,871 --> 01:31:43,206
Let's fly this thing.

1332
01:31:43,707 --> 01:31:45,625
I actually don't have the key.

1333
01:31:45,709 --> 01:31:47,544
I'm just looking after it.

1334
01:31:49,587 --> 01:31:51,172
Just until Monica gets back?

1335
01:31:52,132 --> 01:31:53,299
Yeah.

1336
01:31:54,759 --> 01:31:56,761
Just until Monica gets back.

1337
01:31:57,303 --> 01:31:58,847
I really miss her.

1338
01:31:59,472 --> 01:32:01,558
- We were good together.

1339
01:32:01,641 --> 01:32:03,601
Which got me thinking...

1340
01:32:15,739 --> 01:32:18,533
Pizza delivery.

1341
01:32:19,826 --> 01:32:20,869
Whew!

1342
01:32:22,078 --> 01:32:23,204
Okay.

1343
01:32:29,461 --> 01:32:31,087
Can I help you?

1344
01:32:31,171 --> 01:32:32,547
Kate Bishop.

1345
01:32:35,884 --> 01:32:37,886
Did you think you're the only
kid superhero in the world?

1346
01:32:39,721 --> 01:32:41,181
- Well, I'm 23.
- Oh, I know.

1347
01:32:42,348 --> 01:32:43,475
I've been reading up on you.

1348
01:32:44,559 --> 01:32:45,560
Where did you get that?

1349
01:32:45,643 --> 01:32:47,145
I found it in my couch.

1350
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:48,521
Okay.

1351
01:32:48,605 --> 01:32:50,690
You've just become part
of a much larger universe.

1352
01:32:52,150 --> 01:32:55,862
Which, at the moment,
is just me, mostly.

1353
01:32:55,945 --> 01:32:56,946
I do have feelers out, though.

1354
01:32:57,030 --> 01:32:58,031
Did you know Ant-Man
had a daughter?

1355
01:32:58,114 --> 01:32:59,115
What do you want?

1356
01:32:59,199 --> 01:33:00,825
I'm putting together a team.

1357
01:33:01,493 --> 01:33:02,702
And I want you on it.

1358
01:33:04,287 --> 01:33:05,288
Hmm.

1359
01:33:08,792 --> 01:33:09,793
Please?

1360
01:36:16,771 --> 01:36:17,939
Mom?

1361
01:36:21,192 --> 01:36:22,527
Mom?

1362
01:36:24,195 --> 01:36:26,030
- Mom!
- "Mom"?

1363
01:36:26,114 --> 01:36:28,116
I've missed you so much!

1364
01:36:28,199 --> 01:36:29,450
You missed me?

1365
01:36:29,534 --> 01:36:32,161
- I'm so sorry. I'm... I'm...
- Okay. Okay. Okay, okay.

1366
01:36:32,245 --> 01:36:33,329
Hey, hey, look at me.

1367
01:36:33,413 --> 01:36:34,831
- It's okay. You're okay.

1368
01:36:34,914 --> 01:36:36,624
- Hey.

1369
01:36:36,708 --> 01:36:38,918
How's our mysterious visitor?

1370
01:36:39,002 --> 01:36:41,254
She seems a little disoriented.

1371
01:36:41,337 --> 01:36:43,965
Where... Where are we? What happened?

1372
01:36:44,048 --> 01:36:46,259
We were hoping you could tell us.

1373
01:36:47,176 --> 01:36:49,595
All we know is that Binary found you.

1374
01:36:49,679 --> 01:36:54,017
My theory? You somehow crossed
through a tear in space-time.

1375
01:36:54,100 --> 01:36:56,811
You are now in a reality
parallel to your own.

1376
01:36:57,562 --> 01:37:00,064
Which is, of course, impossible.

1377
01:37:02,984 --> 01:37:05,528
I think there might be
a little confusion happening.

1378
01:37:05,611 --> 01:37:07,530
Confusion is but the first step

1379
01:37:07,613 --> 01:37:08,865
on the journey to knowledge.

1380
01:37:08,948 --> 01:37:11,534
Okay. I'll take it from here.

1381
01:37:11,617 --> 01:37:13,911
Charles asked for an update.

1382
01:37:15,371 --> 01:37:17,081
I'll come by and check on you later.

1383
01:37:28,343 --> 01:37:29,635
Who are you?

1384
01:37:31,012 --> 01:37:32,972
Oh, shit.
