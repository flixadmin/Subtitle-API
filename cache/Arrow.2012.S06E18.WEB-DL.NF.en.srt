[Oliver] <i>Previously on</i>Arrow...

00:00:01,292 --> 00:00:02,335
No, Adrian!

3
00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:05,005
The two of you are
working for Ricardo Diaz.

4
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:06,923
You're both fired effective immediately.

5
00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:10,427
{\an8}<i>Obviously, the Mayor terminated us
to impede the prosecution</i>

6
00:00:10,593 --> 00:00:11,928
{\an8}<i>of his activities as the Green Arrow.</i>

7
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:14,431
{\an8}<i>What Oliver Queen did
is an impeachable offense.</i>

8
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:17,892
The way you lead alienates everyone

9
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:19,769
and everything around you. Look...

10
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:22,772
You put the team at risk by lying.

11
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:26,776
You leave a trail of bodies
every damn place that you go.

12
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:30,071
My trail of bodies
does not include my own brother.

13
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:32,115
Truth is, Oliver, you have
become a better man,

14
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:33,658
but with your focus split,

15
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:35,201
a worse leader.

16
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:38,371
If I'm gonna be the best version
of myself, it can't be with you.

17
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:43,710
You told Rebecca what's going on?

18
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:46,504
You kidding? She'd have my nuts in a vise
if she knew I was on the take.

19
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:48,465
She doesn't get it.
It's a different city now.

20
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:49,549
It's a different world.

21
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,385
We better call back up.

22
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,763
-It might just be a power surge.
-It's not. Call back up now.

{\an8}You know, they can't
actually impeach you for firing

52
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,366
{\an8}two people on Diaz's payroll.

53
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:41,202
{\an8}They can if they claim
I did it to protect myself.

54
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:45,999
{\an8}We need rock-solid proof
that they're working for Diaz.

55
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:47,083
{\an8}That's why you have me.

56
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,710
{\an8}But in the meantime,
I have something else.

57
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:52,380
{\an8}I just have some more evidence on
how Diaz has corrupted the SCPD.

58
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:54,757
{\an8}So, ever since
Dinah and company got fired,

59
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,886
{\an8}I have been monitoring
the station's internal security feed.

60
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:00,555
{\an8}Every night at 10:13, this happens.

61
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,640
{\an8}Whoop!

62
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,142
{\an8}Forty-five minutes later,

63
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,603
{\an8}the feed goes back online like clockwork.

64
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:08,813
{\an8}He's monitoring his minions-in-blue.

65
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,190
{\an8}-He's gotta be.
-I agree.

66
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:12,650
{\an8}If you're thinking
what I think you're thinking,

67
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,152
{\an8}you need to stop
thinking it right now. It's bad.

68
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:16,529
{\an8}I can't make a move
on Diaz unless I know where he is.

69
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:20,158
{\an8}And you just told me where he is
every night at 10:13.

70
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:22,368
{\an8}You can't storm the bad cop
castle by yourself, Oliver.

71
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:25,079
{\an8}-It's suicide.
-If I get Diaz, this is all done.

72
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:28,625
{\an8}The investigation,
the corruption, the impeachment...

73
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,251
{\an8}All of it, I stop all of it.

74
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:31,961
{\an8}You can't go there alone.

75
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,504
{\an8}You will not come out.

76
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:35,465
{\an8}You need help.

77
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:36,841
{\an8}All of our help quit.

78
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,802
{\an8}Well, maybe John has changed his mind.

79
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:41,763
{\an8}What are you talking about?

80
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:43,014
{\an8}[John] Hey, Oliver.

81
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:49,729
{\an8}John?

82
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:53,691
{\an8}-What do you need?
-Well, Felicity said that

83
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:56,361
{\an8}she needed to update
the code on my chip.

84
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,655
{\an8}She also said that
you would be at City Hall.

85
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:01,032
{\an8}Well, I said he might be.

86
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:02,784
{\an8}I didn't say he would be.

87
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:03,993
{\an8}And, yeah, I parent-trapped you,

88
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,287
{\an8}but it was a little naive
of you to think that I wouldn't

89
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:07,997
{\an8}considering how well
you know me, you know.

90
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:11,376
Now that we are all together,

91
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,628
we can talk about what happened.

92
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:15,672
I'm pretty sure John has
said everything he needs to say.

93
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,090
I think you're absolutely right. I did.

94
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:18,174
[Felicity] Guys!

95
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,218
{\an8}This isn't about
what he said, or what he said,

96
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:22,178
{\an8}or your egos. We have
bigger problems at hand here.

97
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,429
{\an8}We need to stop Diaz.

98
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:24,764
{\an8}And we have some pretty good intel.

99
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:25,974
{\an8}Good intel tends to fall apart

100
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:27,809
{\an8}in the hands of bad leadership,
don't you think?

101
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:29,686
{\an8}Oliver, come on,
it doesn't have to be that way.

102
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,229
{\an8}How would you like it to be?

103
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,441
{\an8}Well, it doesn't change
the fact that neither of you

104
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:36,526
{\an8}can take down Diaz alone.

105
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,403
I think there's more
than one way to catch Diaz.

106
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,989
I've been offered a job at A.R.G.U.S.

107
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:42,073
Are you gonna take it?

108
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:43,533
I'm thinking about it. Why?

109
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,868
Last time you needed something
from A.R.G.U.S., you had to steal it.

110
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:47,328
{\an8}Oliver.

111
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,957
{\an8}You keep that attitude, man,
you're gonna end up all alone.

112
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,168
{\an8}I have listened to your advice
for the last six years.

113
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:57,463
{\an8}I think I've earned a reprieve.

114
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:05,680
{\an8}That is not how I thought that would go.

115
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:06,806
{\an8}[John] Sure it was.

116
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:08,599
{\an8}This is who he is, Felicity.

117
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:10,893
{\an8}And no one knows that more than you.

118
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,816
{\an8}Elected officials cannot fire

119
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:20,278
{\an8}the very law enforcement
personnel investigating them.

120
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:22,905
{\an8}To do so, is the definition
of obstruction of justice.

121
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:26,159
{\an8}Captain Hill and D.A. Armand were
actively sabotaging the city

122
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:28,328
{\an8}by allying themselves with Ricardo Diaz.

123
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:32,457
{\an8}I was not obstructing justice.
I was serving it.

124
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:37,086
{\an8}From what I understand, Ricardo Diaz
is a second-rate drug dealer

125
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,380
who was released
from prison on a technicality.

126
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,007
I fail to see your point.

127
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:44,302
The idea that he could
compromise a police captain

128
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:47,221
and a District Attorney is laughable.

129
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:50,141
I assume that the Mayor
will get a chance

130
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:53,227
to address the City Council,
lay out the facts as he sees them?

131
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:57,106
Preliminary impeachment
proceedings begin this afternoon.

132
00:05:57,565 --> 00:06:00,818
The Mayor will have a chance
to plead his case, of course.

133
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,863
For your sake, Mr. Mayor,
and for the sake of your administration,

134
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:07,325
I hope you have something
more concrete to offer the council

135
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:10,453
other than unsupported suspicions.

136
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:16,167
And I know we haven't
always gotten along,

137
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,212
but I do believe in due process.

138
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:23,299
I'll make sure the council
approaches this fairly.

139
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,718
I will see you
and the council this afternoon

140
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:26,844
with evidence.

141
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:34,102
Uh, you mind if I ask
what evidence exactly?

142
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:35,228
Felicity's working on it.

143
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:36,979
I guess that's somewhat reassuring.

144
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,857
On the bright side,
if I get impeached, you get promoted.

145
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:42,693
[chuckles] I'm not much
of a politician, Oliver.

146
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:45,947
Well, with Diaz running the city
it's not really politics, is it?

147
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,324
Is that the only thing bothering you?

148
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:49,408
Diaz?

149
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:52,286
You've looked better.

150
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:53,746
John quit.

151
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,834
I'd say he quit the team, but...

152
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:00,336
there's no team.

153
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:04,132
He seems to think I'm to blame for that.

154
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:06,425
-Well, I don't see it that way.
-You're not there, Quentin.

155
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:07,510
[Quentin] Yeah, I know.

156
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:10,263
But I was there when
The Hood first showed up, remember?

157
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,807
[Quentin] And that guy bears
very little resemblance

158
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,142
to the guy I'm talking to now.

159
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:16,978
I mean, look at you,
you're the mayor, you're a family man.

160
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:19,021
You're out busting
your hump every night for this city.

161
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,607
I've seen how much
you've changed, Oliver.

162
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:22,942
So, why is all this happening?

163
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:25,319
[Quentin] Cayden James and Diaz,
they've done a number.

164
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:28,531
But things will get better.
You just gotta stay the course.

165
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,534
[Quentin] Where are you going?

166
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:35,163
Going to check in on Felicity,
see if she's making any progress.

167
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:38,958
And I promised William that
I'd take him to his science fair.

168
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,918
It's not the best timing.

169
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,753
I think schools plan it that way.

170
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:47,633
William, you outdid me.

171
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,178
For my science fair project,
all I did was hack Napster.

172
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:51,304
What's Napster?

173
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:54,348
Wow, I am getting older by the minute.

174
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,267
I can't believe you cloned a cabbage.

175
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,853
When I was a girl,
cabbage grew in the ground.

176
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:00,480
Well, you're a long way from home, Raisa.

177
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,940
That I know. I'll put these in the car.

178
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,150
Thank you.

179
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:07,111
I just really hope it's better than
Sarah Epstein's solar hot dog cooker.

180
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:09,363
She's really been talking it up.

181
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:11,324
We're going to be late. Where's Dad?

182
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:12,533
-He'll be here...
-[Oliver] Hey.

183
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:13,743
[William] Finally, let's go.

184
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:16,621
Yeah, I know. I just gotta talk
to Felicity for one second.

185
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:18,998
-But we're already late.
-Just a minute, I promise.

186
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,374
[sighs in exasperation]

187
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:23,544
Council's convening.

188
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,422
I promised them
I would show them something.

189
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:27,632
Prepare to be happy.

190
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:29,050
Documentation of threats from Diaz

191
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:31,302
to Hill's family
and bank statements proving

192
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:33,179
that he paid for Armand's
son's cancer treatment.

193
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:34,263
That's it. That's good work.

194
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,182
Yeah, it's really good work.
It might be too good work.

195
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:38,309
Without the SCPD, the only
person that can really obtain

196
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:39,477
this type of evidence is...

197
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,270
Well, as far as
the council is concerned, is...

198
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,940
-You.
-Are you telling me that

199
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,067
the single piece
of evidence that will stop

200
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,653
this imminent impeachment
is also the evidence

201
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:50,696
that will directly connect me
to being the Green Arrow?

202
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,365
I mean, you can tell them that
you're married to a super-hacker.

203
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:53,449
-It's not funny.
-I know,

204
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,327
I tried to plant a fake trail,
it's just that I ran out of time...

205
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,745
You ran out of time,

206
00:08:57,828 --> 00:09:00,873
because you're focusing
on making John and I reconcile

207
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,667
instead of doing your job.

208
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,710
Hey, I'm on your side here.

209
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:05,920
[Oliver] Are you on my side?
[Felicity] Yes, of course...

210
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:07,505
-Are you sure you're on my side?
-How can you say something like that?

211
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:08,589
What is wrong with you?

212
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:09,757
Dad, you said you'll only be a minute.

213
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,175
I'm in the middle of something, please.

214
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,761
-We're gonna be late.
-Well then, we're gonna be late!

215
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,352
Buddy, I'm really sorry.

216
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:25,356
-Get out.
-Felicity, it was an accident.

217
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:27,149
I will take care of William.

218
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:29,735
Get out.

219
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,292
{\an8}[knocking]

220
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:49,505
[gasping]

221
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,590
[Felicity] What's wrong?

222
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:53,259
Looks like you half expected me to be
a member of the League of Assassins.

223
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:56,596
No, I thought I heard something.

224
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:00,516
-How's William?
-He won't come out of his room.

225
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,268
[sighs] Look, I don't...

226
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,354
I have no idea what came over me,

227
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,858
what made me lose it on him like that.

228
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,278
Everything's piling up.

229
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:13,613
[Felicity] Yeah, I know.

230
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,407
I think we should take some space, Oliver.

231
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:22,496
[chuckles]

232
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,627
I'm sorry, what?

233
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,836
How you lost it on William,

234
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,797
that is crossing a line.

235
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:33,966
[Felicity] I know that you
have a lot on your plate.

236
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,302
Diaz, John, then the impeachment,

237
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:39,388
but that is no excuse. It can't
be an excuse. He is your son.

238
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,974
And you just showed him
the man his father really is.

239
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,187
That is not the man that I married.

240
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,533
[knocking]

241
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:01,535
Hey.

242
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:05,915
-You okay?
-Thanks for coming.

243
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:09,752
[Quentin] Listen, I've... I know
I've said this already, but, uh...

244
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:11,712
you don't look good.

245
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:13,255
Felicity...

246
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:18,969
Felicity found proof that

247
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,680
Hill and Armand are in bed with Diaz.

248
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:22,848
That's great.

249
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:24,392
It's great.

250
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,728
Why you got a face that says otherwise?

251
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:30,231
Council's gonna ask me
how I got that evidence.

252
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:32,858
And you don't exactly
wanna tell them it's your wife.

253
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:36,278
Just shine a big fat light
on the suspicion I'm the Green Arrow.

254
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:38,781
What are you gonna do?

255
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:40,783
I don't know.

256
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:45,454
My wife wants a separation.

257
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:49,542
I lost my temper in front of my son.

258
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:52,628
I scared him.

259
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,256
It was really bad.

260
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:58,300
Well, you know, just apologize to the kid,

261
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,511
sleep on the couch for tonight, and...

262
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,180
A separation just seems a little extreme.

263
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,683
But, Quentin, with everything
that's been happening,

264
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:09,228
it feels like par for the course.

265
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:10,312
You're talking about John Diggle?

266
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,399
John, Curtis, Rene, Dinah...

267
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,526
Why haven't you quit?

268
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:17,236
The promise of a raise.

269
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,114
[groans]

270
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,074
You said...

271
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:24,660
You said I've changed.
I appreciate what you said.

272
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,418
Why does everyone keep leaving me?

273
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:34,962
It's the thing about change, right?

274
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:39,884
You hope you're doing the right thing
by becoming a better person,

275
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:42,678
but you're also
becoming a different person.

276
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:44,054
Some people, they just...

277
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,390
I guess, like John, they just react badly.

278
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,017
That's one possibility.

279
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,101
What's the other?

280
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,519
That I haven't really changed at all.

281
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:53,439
[scoffs] Come on, I don't buy that.

282
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:56,108
[Quentin] What you told me about John
and Curtis, all those guys,

283
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,193
they got their own issues.

284
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,486
They're just putting them on you.

285
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,404
And Felicity?

286
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,699
Felicity loves you, man.

287
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,035
[Quentin] That thing with her and William,

288
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,786
it's gonna blow over.
Don't worry about that.

289
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:09,330
My advice,

290
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:12,833
you just gotta focus on what's
right in front of us now, okay?

291
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,212
I'm gonna reach out
to Samanda Watson.

292
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,838
Maybe she can help cover us on this.

293
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,215
Quentin, the woman wants me in prison.

294
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,008
But she also wants justice, right?

295
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:23,677
Taking down a crime boss
who's overrun a city

296
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,179
seems to fit the bill in my eyes.

297
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,932
Yeah, call her.

298
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:30,935
Now, listen.

299
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:32,895
That council meeting's in an hour.

300
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,438
I gotta focus.

301
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:37,983
I gotta push this stuff
out of my head, but I'll be there.

302
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,902
See you back at City Hall.

303
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:46,492

307
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:11,433
Hello, Oliver.

308
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,643
Long time.

309
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,230
No, you...

310
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:18,065
You killed yourself.

311
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,525
Funny thing.

312
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,194
You never did go back for my body.

313
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,864
Guess you were
somewhat preoccupied, right?

314
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:26,532
Still...

315
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:28,242
seems a little careless.

316
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:29,994
[gunshot]

317
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:31,328
Come on, man.

318
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:34,206
You've seen people come back from
what seemed like certain death.

319
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:35,833
As I recall,

320
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:38,836
you once were stabbed,

321
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:40,921
and fell off of a mountain,

322
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,548
yet, here you are.

323
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,550
[multiple gunshots]

324
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,763
[both grunting]

325
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:20,961
Do it.

326
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:22,630
I didn't last time.

327
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:25,382
And then I killed
the mother of your son. [grunts]

328
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,885
I'm not playing games this time.

329
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:32,097
[groaning] This time, I'm coming
for you and Felicity and William.

330
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:35,351
Anyone and everyone
who's ever been close to you.

331
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:40,272
There's only one way
that you can stop me.

332
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:50,115
[panting]

333
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:51,784
[coughing]

334
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,174
[knocking]

335
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:16,850
[Adrian] Oh, now, wasn't that better?

336
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,560
You know,

337
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:21,981
you might just have to
start considering the possibility

338
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,650
that I'm just not killable, Oliver.

339
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:30,406
No, Adrian.

340
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,200
You're dead.

341
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,787
You're still on Lian Yu.

342
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,958
[sighs]

343
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,047
I'm hallucinating.

344
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:02,771
[Adrian] I knew you'd kill me.

345
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,148
Or try to.

346
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:08,068
I always was the one person
who saw you for the murderer you are.

347
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,279
What are you doing?

348
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,281
Oh.

349
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,242
Oh! You're running a blood test.

350
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:17,369
You think you've been
dosed with something.

351
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:18,662
You know,

352
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:22,291
there is another explanation,
a more likely one,

353
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,168
in my considered opinion.

354
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:28,589
You're finally going crazy.

355
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:32,092
It's completely understandable,
Ollie, you've lost every thing,

356
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:34,887
even the people I couldn't
manage to take from you.

357
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,638
I really like this Ricardo Diaz.

358
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,141
If he didn't exist,
I'd have to think him up myself.

359
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,226
He's going about all this exactly right.

360
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:45,314
Don't hurt the people that you love,

361
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:49,526
just get them all to abandon you.

362
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,112
It's actually the easiest
thing in the world.

363
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,531
I told you this, Ollie,
I told you this, man.

364
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:57,201
Everything you touch dies.

365
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,662
What you're going through right now,

366
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,998
losing your team, your wife,

367
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,708
the impeachment, all of it,

368
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:07,544
it's happening just like
I told you it would.

369
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:12,591
And nothing in that
blood test is gonna change that.

370
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,802
[beeping]

371
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:19,723
Well?

372
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,183
Vertigo.

373
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,604
It was absorbed through my...

374
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:31,527
[exhales] Kullens.

375
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,903
Friend of yours?

376
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:34,696
Apparently not.

377
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:45,040
[Adrian] Don't. Don't go talk to Quentin.

378
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,918
You're not in the state of mind
to be talking to him right now.

379
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:49,586
He might have you committed,

380
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:51,964
which would be a shame,

381
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:55,092
since by my count, he's the only
person still left in your corner.

382
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:57,386
Okay, Felicity,
William and I will be fine.

383
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:58,846
I just need to talk to them.

384
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,472
[Adrian] Maybe. But what about the rest?

385
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,266
It's tough to say you're in a good place

386
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:04,309
when your oldest friend
leaves you high and dry.

387
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:05,644
John made his choice.

388
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:07,729
Deep down, you know he's right.

389
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,023
You've changed, sure.

390
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:14,111
Maybe you are a better Oliver Queen,

391
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:17,030
a happier Oliver Queen.

392
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:23,412
But it has sure made you a worse hero.

393
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,414
You have a wife, a son,

394
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,958
you're the mayor,
all of which, yes, may be going away,

395
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:30,335
but still, it's a fair assumption

396
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,631
you're stretched too thin, buddy.

397
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:38,343
Maybe you've gotten so good
at being Oliver Queen,

398
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:42,139
that the Green Arrow's
mission is suffering.

399
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:46,268
You may be happier,
but the people that you love,

400
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:47,895
they're not.

401
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:51,565
Hey, what's Vertigo do?

402
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,276
Does it show you your worst fear?

403
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,403
You're not my worst fear, Adrian.

404
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,740
You're nowhere close.

405
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:01,617
Oh.

406
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:04,786
I know. Your worst fear is yourself.

407
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,039
Your worst enemy is yourself.

408
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:13,128
Guys like me, Ricardo Diaz,
Damien Darhk, Ra's al Ghul...

409
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,881
When it comes to destroying you, Oliver,

410
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:19,176
we all come in second place.

411
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,809
You're the one enemy you can't defeat.

412
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:35,776
[phone ringing and vibrating]

413
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,071
Yes, Quentin.

414
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,073
Hearing's about to start,
where the hell are you?

415
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:45,577
Well, Kullens dosed me with Vertigo,
and I've been dealing with it.

416
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,455
Didn't you say that Diaz was
dealing Vertigo these days?

417
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:50,999
Well, Kullens is working
for Diaz apparently.

418
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,293
[Oliver] <i>Now, listen.
Where are we with Agent Watson?</i>

419
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:54,586
She's mulling it over.

420
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:55,879
She's gotta mull faster.

421
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,214
[Quentin] <i>All right,
I'll give her another call.</i>

422
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:59,675
Listen, just get down here
as fast as you can. All right?

423
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:00,968
I'm on my way.

424
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,244
[Laurel] Ollie.

425
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,166
Why are you looking at me like that?

426
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,544
[sighs]

427
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:41,300
Ollie, are you okay?

428
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:43,593
I don't know.

429
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:45,012
You know, if you tell her the truth,

430
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:47,222
she'll just think you're crazy, Oliver.

431
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:50,267
You'll break her heart
all over again, nobody wants that.

432
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,812
Hey. Hey, you can
tell me anything, you know that.

433
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:55,439
I know that.

434
00:21:58,608 --> 00:21:59,860
I need to leave.

435
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:01,653
I thought the boat left at 6:00.

436
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:02,946
What?

437
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:06,033
The <i>Gambit.</i>The trip that you're
going on with your father.

438
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:08,744
I ran into Sara. She said
that you hadn't packed yet.

439
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,037
Do you want me to help you?

440
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,914
Look at how innocent she was,
how much she loved you.

441
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,125
You destroyed that.

442
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:17,544
-Ollie?
-Tell her about her future, man.

443
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:20,839
Tell her about what happens
when she becomes the Black Canary.

444
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:22,716
[Laurel] <i>Ollie, please help me.</i>

445
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,010
Please, I'm scared.

446
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:26,595
I don't wanna die.

447
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:28,805
This is gonna destroy my father.

448
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:30,807
He can't handle this.

449
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:32,350
She's got a point.

450
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:33,435
Eh...

451
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,103
My question is,

452
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:38,356
why did you let her become
the Black Canary in the first place?

453
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:40,150
She's a lawyer!

454
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:42,235
What, after a couple
of self-defense classes,

455
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,820
and a few sparring sessions with you,

456
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:46,448
you think she's ready
to go handle thugs and killers?

457
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,161
It was a mistake.

458
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:52,621
[Adrian] Yeah, your mistake.

459
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:54,206
Which I had to pay for.

460
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:55,540
It was a mistake.

461
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:00,337
But I knew you.

462
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:05,008
And I knew that you'd
do it with or without me.

463
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:09,304
I thought this way I could protect you.

464
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:11,348
How did that work out for you, Ollie? Huh?

465
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:14,643
[Wild Dog] Yeah, "Ollie."

466
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:16,561
How'd that work out for you?

467
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,230
For me, not too good.

468
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:20,023
Mmm-mmm. I gave you an out.

469
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:22,943
I told you to stand down.

470
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:24,903
-Stay down!
-No way!

471
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:30,325
[Wild Dog] You know,
John came to see me in here.

472
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:31,952
Felicity, too.

473
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:33,703
But you were nowhere, hoss.

474
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:35,163
[Mr. Terrific] He's got a point, Oliver.

475
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:38,583
If your conscience is so sparkly clean,
why didn't you check on Rene?

476
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,460
Rene made it clear...

477
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:43,130
Matter of fact,
all of you have made it clear

478
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:44,923
that you don't want
anything to do with me.

479
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:46,508
Always a comeback for everything.

480
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:47,843
That's enough.

481
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:50,512
It's not real.

482
00:23:58,311 --> 00:23:59,312
Raisa?

483
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,984
It's not safe here for you.

484
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:06,528
A man came.

485
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:09,156
Hey, hey, hey.

486
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:10,323
Raisa, what man?

487
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:12,117
With a dragon tattoo.

488
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:14,494
He wants to hurt you.

489
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:17,789
I tried to stop him.

490
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:22,919
[Diaz] Well, the lady wouldn't
go down without a fight.

491
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:26,214
Your wife and kid aren't here.

492
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:29,509
They're at some science fair.

493
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:31,303
Come on, come on, come on.

494
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:33,972
You still think this isn't real?

495
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:36,516
[grunts]

496
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,896
Does that feel real enough for you?

497
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:42,063
Argh!

498
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,648
I always wonder

499
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:45,817
why nobody just does that.

500
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:48,737
Kill you straight.

501
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,448
Turns out it'd be a waste of time.

502
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:54,117
You're more dangerous as a martyr

503
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:56,536
than you are as Green Arrow.

504
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:58,955
But before that happens,

505
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,750
there's a lot left of you

506
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,170
that I wanna break.

507
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:06,880
[exhales]

508
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:17,766
[groans]

509
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:20,101
[panting]

510
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:22,896
[moans]

511
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:47,128
Yeah, Quentin, hi. I'm gonna
need that hearing delayed.

512
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:49,881
I'll explain everything.
I'm on my way to City Hall.

513
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:54,261
You have failed this city.

514
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:58,056
And you know why.

515
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:00,141
Because I got away from you.

516
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,061
We were never supposed to have partners.

517
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,855
There was never
supposed to be a John Diggle,

518
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:08,149
a Felicity Smoak,

519
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:10,235
a Team Arrow.

520
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,863
There was never
supposed to be a Green Arrow.

521
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:16,116
There was only the mission.

522
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:17,951
I lost sight of that.

523
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:19,327
You lost your city!

524
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:23,873
And now, you know what you have to do

525
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:26,626
to get it back.

526
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:38,471
It's been over an hour.
Where is the Mayor?

527
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:41,516
Well, why don't you ask Ricardo Diaz?

528
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:45,478
Apologies for being late.

529
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,439
Over an hour late.

530
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:50,775
And we certainly hope you've come
with something worthy of our time.

531
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:52,819
One minute.

532
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,406
-Are you all right?
-No.

533
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:58,158
[sighs heavily]

534
00:26:58,575 --> 00:26:59,909
Where are we with Watson?

535
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,203
We're on our own.

536
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:06,875
It's our only card.

537
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,710
Are you sure you wanna play it?

538
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:12,380
It's our only card.

539
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:23,516
Mr. Mayor...

540
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,810
Okay, this flash drive

541
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:29,773
contains financial data
and correspondence

542
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:33,360
linking Captain Hill and D.A. Armand

543
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:36,780
with a known felon named Ricardo Diaz.

544
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:38,406
Known by whom?

545
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,658
I've never heard of a Ricardo Diaz.

546
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:42,952
By design, he's kept a very low profile.

547
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:45,205
How did you obtain this purported evidence

548
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:49,167
against our former
police captain and district attorney?

549
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:53,838
The Green Arrow gave it to me.

550
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:57,175
Or perhaps, you gave it to yourself.

551
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:58,301
I'm not the Green Arrow.

552
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:01,805
Not according to the police captain
or D.A. that you fired.

553
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:04,391
And it also seems rather convenient

554
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:06,601
that you're not the Green Arrow,

555
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:10,563
but enjoy a close,
personal relationship with him.

556
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,067
That go down how you expected?

557
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:19,906
Are you aware we can impeach you
not just for obstruction of justice,

558
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:23,034
but for perjury and vigilantism, as well?

559
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:25,995
I am so sorry, but something
very urgent has just come in,

560
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,539
and I need to speak to the Mayor, please.

561
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:28,623
So, please...

562
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:30,834
Ten minutes tops.

563
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:32,419
Thank you.

564
00:28:36,714 --> 00:28:38,967
Wait, what's happening.
Are Felicity and William all right?

565
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,052
Listen, the urgent thing was
just a line to buy us some time.

566
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:42,595
Felicity and William are fine.

567
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:45,515
Okay? It is you I'm worried about.

568
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:47,642
Have you still got that
Vertigo crap in your system?

569
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:51,438
Yeah.

570
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:54,399
Okay, listen, we need to retreat,
we need to regroup.

571
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:55,525
Okay? So I'm gonna go back in there

572
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:58,069
and I'm gonna tell them
you've got a family emergency.

573
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,696
You might not be wrong.

574
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:03,283
Okay, listen, you need to
go back to your secret lair,

575
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:05,285
get yourself well.

576
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:07,412
We'll figure out the next steps.

577
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:14,586
Sorry, Oliver.

578
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,212
Bad beat.

579
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:21,217
For what it's worth, I always thought
you were a halfway decent mayor.

580
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:25,722
Not a great track record when
it comes to hiring D.A.s, though.

581
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:32,395
This Vertigo is going to be
out of my system eventually.

582
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:35,982
Then you'll be gone.

583
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:38,860
Not possible.

584
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:43,448
I'm not here, remember?

585
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:47,327
I'm here.

586
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:49,287
I'm you.

587
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:52,791
Which is why you're gonna listen to me

588
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:54,459
when I tell you what you have to do.

589
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,629
The only way to prove that you're the hero

590
00:29:57,712 --> 00:30:02,133
that you say you are and keep being
mayor is to take down Diaz, tonight.

591
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:03,718
No, he's got an army.

592
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:06,054
You mean all those cops at the SCPD?

593
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:08,014
I mean that walking
in there is a suicide mission.

594
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:11,184
That's the risk
a hero takes, isn't it, Oliver?

595
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:14,896
Diaz is there every night, 10:13 p.m.

596
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:16,981
Question is,

597
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:20,193
will you be there to meet him?

598
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:31,704
Thanks for helping me
put my project back together.

599
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:32,789
[Felicity] No problemo.

600
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:34,415
Second place too. Pretty good,

601
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:37,293
even if that cheater
Sarah Epstein got the gold

602
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:41,172
for her solar hot dog cooker
that I swear I've seen on Amazon.

603
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:43,591
[sighs]

604
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:47,470
You know, when I was your age,
I could hit three science fairs a day

605
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:51,683
and now one...
One knocks me right out.

606
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,226
Where's Dad?

607
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:55,311
He's buying us expensive gifts
if he knows what's good for him.

608
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:56,855
[beeping]

609
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:58,398
Your purse is beeping.

610
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,528
William, go play video games.

611
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:06,239
I gotta do some work,
buddy, all right? Sorry.

612
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:08,491
I know what kind of work. Good luck.

613
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:11,995
[line ringing]

614
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:13,788
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

615
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,752
-Quentin.
-Felicity.

616
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:21,004
<i>Tell me Oliver's with you.</i>

617
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:23,464
He was.
I just sent him back to the bunker.

618
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:24,674
No, he's not on his way there.

619
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:26,342
I have a GPS on his bow
and it's on the move.

620
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:27,719
[Quentin]<i>All right,
slow down, let me explain.</i>

621
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:29,012
<i>It has been a hell of an afternoon.</i>

622
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:32,015
-What happened?
-Oliver was dosed with Vertigo.

623
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:33,224
<i>Kullens did it.</i>

624
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:34,893
That would explain
why he lost it on William.

625
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:37,145
He said you... You kicked him out?

626
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:38,521
No, I didn't. I would never...

627
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:40,398
He's on his way to the precinct.

628
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:42,567
And that's totally my fault.
I told him that Diaz would be there.

629
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,819
[Felicity] <i>Quentin, this is a suicide
mission. You have to stop him.</i>

630
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,571
-I'm on my way.
-Okay.

631
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:49,782
What's happening? Is Dad all right?

632
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,284
No, Dad is on drugs.

633
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:53,286
I mean, not that kind of drugs.
He's gonna be fine.

634
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:54,579
I just... I have to go help him, okay?

635
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:57,123
I know, I was listening.

636
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,333
You're an angel.

637
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,752
Okay. I love you. You're an angel.

638
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,131
[grunts]

639
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:06,507
[Quentin] Hey.

640
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:08,760
Get out of here, Quentin.

641
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:10,053
What're you doing in that old thing?

642
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:11,930
Getting back to my original mission.

643
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,264
Okay, listen,
that's just the Vertigo talking.

644
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:14,349
You cannot go in there.

645
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:15,642
This ends tonight.

646
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:17,352
Even if you weren't high,
this would be a bad idea.

647
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:18,436
You're outnumbered!

648
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:19,520
-I can handle it.
-Listen to me...

649
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:20,813
I said...

650
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:23,983
I can handle it.

651
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:31,824
[intense music playing]

652
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:37,497
Quentin? Quentin!

653
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:39,999
-Hey, you okay?
-[groans]

654
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,001
Yeah, your husband packs a punch.

655
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:43,753
Diaz's men cannot find
the Deputy Mayor here.

656
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:45,755
Okay, you have to
get out of here, all right?

657
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:47,382
I have to go save my husband.

658
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:56,641
[flickering]

659
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:26,170
Don't, don't, don't.

660
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:29,382
Do not open that door.

661
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,300
On the other side of that door,
there's a bunch of

662
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:32,927
trigger-happy cops just waiting for you.

663
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,012
It is a trap.

664
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:36,097
-You're not here.
-Yes, I am. It's me.

665
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:37,890
Okay? It's the real me.

666
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:41,144
Do not go through that door.

667
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:42,437
I have to.

668
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:44,856
-I have to stop Diaz.
-And you will.

669
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:46,524
But not like this, not tonight.

670
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:48,693
He's right on the other side
of that door.

671
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:51,279
So are a bunch of
angry cops just waiting for you.

672
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:53,406
You go through that door,
what happens to William?

673
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:54,490
William has you.

674
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:56,576
Well, what happens to me?

675
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,162
You left.

676
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:00,413
No, I didn't.

677
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:03,583
That was not me, Oliver.

678
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:06,627
The real me is standing right here.

679
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,504
And I'm not going anywhere.

680
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:10,923
I'm glue, baby.

681
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,341
Please.

682
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:16,429
Where are you?

683
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,515
The Vertigo is making its way
through your system, okay?

684
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,476
It's on its last gasp, so just...

685
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:24,020
Just listen. Listen to my voice.

686
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:27,565
No, no, no, don't listen to her.

687
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:29,233
Remember what you told yourself.

688
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:31,152
You were never supposed to have partners.

689
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,780
I know it feels like
you've lost everything.

690
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:39,494
I don't know how to tell if you're real.

691
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:41,829
That's the Vertigo,
it's just messing with your head.

692
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:43,539
Don't trust it.

693
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:45,875
Okay? Listen to your heart.

694
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:05,353
Come on.

695
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:07,480
Screw it.

696
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,066
Go after him.

697
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:17,198
-Come on.
-Just like old times.

698
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:18,282
Thanks for coming back for me.

699
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:22,036
-Okay, less thanking, more escaping!
-Right!

700
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:24,080
[multiple gunshots]

701
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,926
[Oliver] What's this?

702
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:38,427
It's an isotonic concoction
of my own making.

703
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:39,762
There are oranges in there for vitamin C,

704
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:41,013
there's almonds in there for Vitamin E,

705
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:44,267
there's avocado in there
for omega-3s, do not smell it.

706
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:45,518
Just drink it.

707
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:50,648
It's salty.

708
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:51,983
Yeah, that'd be the fermented fish oils.

709
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:54,026
It's supposed to help
balance your serotonin levels.

710
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,487
I call it "Felicity's Party
Raver Hangover Supreme Cure."

711
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:58,781
Though that might be
an insensitive choice of words,

712
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:00,867
considering what you went through,
but trust me, it works like a charm,

713
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,785
not that I've used it much,
I mean, that was all in the past.

714
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,203
Trust me.

715
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:05,454
[clears throat]

716
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:07,665
Drugs are bad.

717
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:10,334
Listen, that was gutsy as hell,
you going into the precinct like that.

718
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:11,752
Yeah, well, my man was in there.

719
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,379
Yeah, but whatever you said there

720
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:14,964
could have been caught
on security cameras.

721
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:16,632
No, Diaz had shut them down.

722
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:18,134
So, our identities are safe.

723
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:19,302
[phone ringing]

724
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,220
Irony sold separately.

725
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:23,681
Excuse me, I gotta take this.
It's the office.

726
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:26,851
I haven't seen that in a while.

727
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:29,812
Wanted to take it for a spin down
memory lane or something?

728
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:31,689
-Something like that.
-[chuckles]

729
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:33,441
Vertigo gave me some

730
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:35,526
clarity.

731
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,445
-Sure you're not still high?
-Mmm-hmm.

732
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,946
[Oliver] John had a point.

733
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:41,824
I've spread myself pretty thin.

734
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:46,913
I'm not giving up on you,
I'm not giving up on William,

735
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:51,667
and if by some miracle
I'm not impeached,

736
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:54,921
I will keep being the mayor.

737
00:36:57,965 --> 00:36:59,967
I believe deeply in the good

738
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:02,386
that I can do as the Green Arrow.

739
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:09,310
But I need to bring
the mission back to basics.

740
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:14,232
I need to bring it back
to where it started.

741
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,733
You mean alone?

742
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:17,276
Alone.

743
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,778
[footsteps]

744
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:20,529
I'm sorry, guys, I hate to interrupt,

745
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:22,698
but we have to turn the TV on. News.

746
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,868
{\an8}<i>In a shocking fall from grace,</i>

747

{\an8}<i>Mayor Oliver Queen
and remove him from office.</i>

{\an8}<i>We now go live to
Councilman Kullens' public statement.</i>

751

fitness for office into question,</i>

752
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:45,471
{\an8}<i>but fundamentally,
it was the unilateral firing</i>

754
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:54,689
Sorry, I just couldn't stand
to listen to him any longer.

755
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:58,734
Okay, listen, I'm gonna call Jean Loring.

756
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:00,194
There's gotta be legal
options we can pursue.

757
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:01,279
No.

758
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:05,616
I don't want you wasting anymore
time or political capital on me.

759
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,451
I don't give a crap
about political capital.

760
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:08,536
You should.

761
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,080
'Cause you're the mayor now.

762
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:14,083
[sighs]

763
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:19,130
Thank you so much, Raisa,
for coming on such short notice.

764
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:21,465
-I'm used to it.
-Thank you, Raisa.

765
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:22,967
Are you okay, Oliver?

766
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:24,427
I'll be just fine, thank you.

767
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,933
I know this question
might be questionable, but...

768
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:32,768
From what it sounded like earlier,

769
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:36,397
it's like you were firing Overwatch.

770
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,107
I'm not firing anyone.

771
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,067
It's just...

772
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:41,944
I need to go back

773
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:44,697
to doing things like I did when I started.

774
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:47,116
And that means

775
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:50,119
doing it alone.

776
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,580
I need to stop Diaz.

777
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:58,627
And in order to do that, I need
to have a single-minded focus.

778
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:02,506
I've gotta separate these two worlds.

779
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,508
I just don't think
that's the best possible solution.

780
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:06,844
[Oliver] I respect your concern,

781
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:09,221
and I love you very much for it.

782
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:11,724
We will talk more about this, but...

783
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:13,976
I need to chat with William.

784
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:15,436
Yeah.

785
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:25,488
Hey.

786
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:28,657
I didn't know if you'd be awake.

787
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:30,993
I can't sleep.

788
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,579
I got a news alert about the impairment.

789
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:35,206
It's impeachment.

790
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:37,416
Don't worry, I'll be fine.

791
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:40,086
I worry about you.

792
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:44,006
I'm really sorry about before.

793
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:46,133
I would never

794
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:50,388
purposefully try to make you afraid, or...

795
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:52,306
Felicity said you were
on some sort of drug.

796
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,391
Accidentally.

797
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:57,937
I was dosed by someone who works
for the man I'm trying to stop.

798
00:39:58,104 --> 00:39:59,271
Ricardo Diaz?

799
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:02,608
Can you stop him?

800
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:04,110
I think maybe I found a way.

801
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:06,487
Most importantly,

802
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:09,365
I need to know
that I'm not gonna lose you,

803
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,660
or Felicity ever.

804
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:14,078
You won't.

805
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:26,882
[suspenseful music playing]

806
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:34,390
Hey.

807
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:36,767
What are you doing here?

808
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:39,019
I heard about what happened.
I wanted to see how you were.

809
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,105
Clearly, I should have brought a broom.

810
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:42,898
[Diaz] He's spiraling.

811
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:46,068
That Vertigo worked
even better than I was hoping.

812
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:48,446
I don't understand why you
don't just put a bullet in him.

813
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:49,530
Or 20.

814
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:51,157
[Diaz] 'Cause it'd be a waste of time.

815
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:53,534
He's more dangerous as a martyr

816
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:55,578
than as the Green Arrow.

817
00:40:57,204 --> 00:40:59,623
I'm gonna dismantle him

818
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:01,542
piece by piece.

819
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:02,835
Like with the impeachment?

820
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:07,590
The impeachment was just the latest step.

821
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:11,385
And what's the next one?

822
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:14,138
We spread the word

823
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:16,891
that with Mayor Queen out,

824
00:41:18,058 --> 00:41:22,646
Star City, it's open for business.
