1
00:00:01,325 --> 00:00:03,907
My name is Damien Darhk.

2
00:00:03,932 --> 00:00:07,636
In 2016, I was murdered
by the Green Arrow.

3
00:00:07,638 --> 00:00:10,875
But I was removed from the
timeline 31 years before

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:14,749
my death by a speedster from
the future named Eobard Thawne.

5
00:00:14,774 --> 00:00:16,440
Together, with Malcolm Merlyn,

6
00:00:16,465 --> 00:00:18,647
a former head of the
League of Assassins,

7
00:00:18,649 --> 00:00:22,017
the three of us are going to
locate the Spear of Destiny;

8
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:25,687
a mystical object which
can rewrite reality itself.

9
00:00:25,689 --> 00:00:27,322
With the Spear in our possession,

10
00:00:27,324 --> 00:00:30,158
we will change our past and our future.

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,328
And the world as you know it.

12
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:35,364
Previously on â€œLegends of Tomorrowâ€...

13
00:00:35,366 --> 00:00:37,199
A deep scan reveals that Captain Hunter's

14
00:00:37,201 --> 00:00:39,268
neural architecture
has been reprogrammed

15
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:40,502
with a new identity.

16
00:00:40,504 --> 00:00:42,283
The Longinus Medallion.

17
00:00:44,862 --> 00:00:46,009
Rip!

18
00:00:46,034 --> 00:00:48,310
I know that you're one of the protectors

19
00:00:48,312 --> 00:00:51,079
of the Spear of Destiny
and I know that you know

20
00:00:51,081 --> 00:00:52,548
where the other pieces are hidden.

21
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:54,483
You're gonna torture me, aren't you?

22
00:00:54,485 --> 00:00:56,218
I'm not gonna torture you.

23
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,353
They are.

24
00:01:04,862 --> 00:01:07,930
Damien Darhk, the man behind
tonight's siege of Star City,

25
00:01:07,932 --> 00:01:09,798
was killed by the masked vigilante

26
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,567
known as the Green Arrow.

27
00:01:11,569 --> 00:01:14,269
Amateur cell phone video
captured his final moments,

28
00:01:14,271 --> 00:01:17,573
putting an end to the chaos
that has gripped the city.

29
00:01:37,828 --> 00:01:40,462
This is the great Malcolm Merlyn?

30
00:01:40,464 --> 00:01:41,897
I am unimpressed.

31
00:01:41,899 --> 00:01:43,599
Well, he's fallen on hard times.

32
00:01:43,601 --> 00:01:48,097
But this man used to be Ra's al Ghul.

33
00:01:48,122 --> 00:01:50,916
Uh, we haven't met. I'm Eobard Thawne.

34
00:01:50,918 --> 00:01:54,019
I'm... from the future.

35
00:01:54,021 --> 00:01:55,721
What the hell is going on here?

36
00:01:55,723 --> 00:01:58,023
Excellent question. Here's another...

37
00:01:58,025 --> 00:02:00,192
Do you believe in second chances?

38
00:02:00,194 --> 00:02:02,294
I just watched you die.

39
00:02:02,296 --> 00:02:04,964
Yeah, I hear 2016's not my best year,

40
00:02:04,966 --> 00:02:06,966
but I plan on fixing that.

41
00:02:06,968 --> 00:02:09,101
But the question for you, Malcolm, is:

42
00:02:09,103 --> 00:02:13,305
Do you wish to see your
fortunes similarly reversed?

43
00:02:13,307 --> 00:02:14,807
By time travel?

44
00:02:14,809 --> 00:02:17,343
No. No.

45
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:19,745
Something much better.

46

47
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:41,133
- Well?
- No luck. So far.

48
00:02:41,135 --> 00:02:43,002
It's not that Captain
Hunter's uncooperative.

49
00:02:43,004 --> 00:02:46,839
It's that he's not fully in
possession of his marbles.

50
00:02:46,841 --> 00:02:49,909
So he won't tell us where the
rest of the Spear of Destiny is?

51
00:02:49,911 --> 00:02:51,677
Uh, it's more like... can't.

52
00:02:51,679 --> 00:02:53,512
Which wouldn't be such a problem

53
00:02:53,514 --> 00:02:56,916
if you two idiots hadn't
lost the Longinus Medallion.

54
00:02:56,918 --> 00:02:59,251
I seem to remember
you being there as well.

55
00:02:59,253 --> 00:03:01,253
Until you weren't.

56
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,023
I hate when he does that.

57
00:03:04,025 --> 00:03:05,958
If you have something
to say to me, Malcolm,

58
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,027
I suggest you keep it to yourself.

59
00:03:08,029 --> 00:03:09,595
I'm sorry.

60
00:03:09,597 --> 00:03:11,163
Am I supposed to be afraid of you?

61
00:03:11,165 --> 00:03:14,033
Oh, I would be.
Considering I can kill you

62
00:03:14,035 --> 00:03:16,035
before you even knew I was doing it.

63
00:03:16,037 --> 00:03:17,336
Ah, yes.

64
00:03:17,338 --> 00:03:19,738
But then you wouldn't get what you want.

65
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:23,208
You brought me and Damien into
your little quest for a reason.

66
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:24,743
Without the Medallion,

67
00:03:24,745 --> 00:03:27,580
Hunter is our only way to
get the rest of the Spear.

68
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,582
You need me to get it out of him.

69
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:31,250
We already tried torture.

70
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:32,985
I'm not talking about torture.

71
00:03:32,987 --> 00:03:35,087
I'm talking about hypnosis.

72
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:36,922
Regression therapy.

73
00:03:40,127 --> 00:03:42,728
Hunter's mind is locked away.

74
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:45,631
I've got the key.

75
00:03:48,836 --> 00:03:50,469
Is this some technique you picked up

76
00:03:50,471 --> 00:03:52,371
with the League of Assassins?

77
00:03:52,373 --> 00:03:55,207
The League didn't call me
â€œthe Magicianâ€ for nothing.

78
00:03:55,209 --> 00:03:56,875
Well, be quick about it.

79
00:03:56,877 --> 00:04:01,480
Speedsters aren't
known for their patience.

80
00:04:01,482 --> 00:04:03,916
What's to keep Hunter's crew from finding

81
00:04:03,918 --> 00:04:05,250
the rest of the Spear

82
00:04:05,252 --> 00:04:06,518
before Merlyn finishes

83
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,287
unscrambling Hunter's brain?

84
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:09,755
The workings of the Medallion

85
00:04:09,757 --> 00:04:11,757
are lost to history.

86
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:14,159
Trying to get it to reveal its
secrets will prove difficult.

87
00:04:14,161 --> 00:04:16,996
Plus, we have an additional
advantage over them.

88
00:04:16,998 --> 00:04:19,365
Enlighten me.

89
00:04:19,367 --> 00:04:20,666
They're idiots.

90
00:04:20,668 --> 00:04:22,334
- You're all idiots.
- Excuse me?

91
00:04:22,336 --> 00:04:23,936
Pot, meet kettle...

92
00:04:23,938 --> 00:04:25,170
Yeah, Mick. Given your glass house,

93
00:04:25,172 --> 00:04:26,267
you shouldn't throw stones.

94
00:04:26,292 --> 00:04:28,440
Mixing metaphors isn't
going to solve anything.

95
00:04:28,442 --> 00:04:29,472
How about instead of bickering,

96
00:04:29,496 --> 00:04:31,143
we figure out our next
move against the speedster

97
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:32,221
and his allies.

98
00:04:32,246 --> 00:04:33,846
â€œLegion of Doomâ€
has a sexier ring to it.

99
00:04:33,848 --> 00:04:35,648
I'm not calling them that.

100
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,183
And we need to figure
out a way to rescue Rip.

101
00:04:38,185 --> 00:04:40,786
All you gotta do is trade
the Amulet, or the Medallion,

102
00:04:40,788 --> 00:04:43,055
for the Englishman. It's really simple.

103
00:04:43,057 --> 00:04:44,857
The only thing is, I
don't know how it works.

104
00:04:44,859 --> 00:04:46,959
Hmm. You're an idiot.

105
00:04:46,961 --> 00:04:49,161
You want to put an artifact
that can rewrite reality

106
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:51,330
into the hands of the
enemy and we're the idiots?

107
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:52,798
- Mm-hmm.
- Our priority has to be

108
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,500
identifying this speedster.

109
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:57,136
Of course you'd say
that. I mean, he is the one

110
00:04:57,138 --> 00:04:58,404
that killed your boyfriend, so...

111
00:04:58,406 --> 00:04:59,474
He's at the center of this,

112
00:04:59,498 --> 00:05:01,173
and you can't defeat an
enemy that you don't know.

113
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:02,441
Look, Amaya's right.

114
00:05:02,443 --> 00:05:04,476
And I hate to say it, but so is Mick.

115
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:07,279
- I'm not an idiot.
- Not about being idiots.

116
00:05:07,281 --> 00:05:09,715
About using the Medallion as leverage.

117
00:05:09,717 --> 00:05:11,917
But first, we need to
figure out how it works.

118
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,719
Well, in my defense,
it's a mystical object.

119
00:05:13,721 --> 00:05:15,454
It doesn't come with
a set of instructions.

120
00:05:15,456 --> 00:05:17,556
Maybe's that been the
problem, approaching it

121
00:05:17,558 --> 00:05:20,325
from a mystical vantage instead
of leaning into our strengths,

122
00:05:20,327 --> 00:05:21,593
- which are...
- Technological.

123
00:05:21,595 --> 00:05:23,228
Exactly. And as it happens,

124
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:25,631
I have a colleague in
Central City whose knowledge

125
00:05:25,633 --> 00:05:28,367
might prove to be advantageous.

126
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:31,804
Gideon, set a course
for Central City, 2017.

127
00:05:31,806 --> 00:05:33,472
Jax, stick with Martin.

128
00:05:33,474 --> 00:05:36,308
And let's work on putting
a name to our speedster.

129
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:40,245
Aww, here comes a man

130
00:05:40,247 --> 00:05:42,014
who looks like he just struck out.

131
00:05:42,016 --> 00:05:43,749
Don't get smug with me, Damien.

132
00:05:43,751 --> 00:05:45,684
I may not have all my prior resources,

133
00:05:45,686 --> 00:05:47,519
but at least I'm not dead.

134
00:05:47,521 --> 00:05:49,054
Look, I couldn't get Hunter to remember

135
00:05:49,056 --> 00:05:52,691
because his memories aren't
buried or locked away.

136
00:05:52,693 --> 00:05:54,026
They're gone.

137
00:05:54,028 --> 00:05:57,029
It's like his old self didn't exist.

138
00:05:57,031 --> 00:05:58,664
Are you sure about that?

139
00:05:58,666 --> 00:05:59,932
Do you think you can do any better?

140
00:05:59,934 --> 00:06:01,233
You are welcome to try.

141
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:02,501
We already tried torture.

142
00:06:02,503 --> 00:06:04,303
You know what I love about torture?

143
00:06:04,305 --> 00:06:06,238
I'm not sure if you have
enough time for me to list

144
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,173
all the reasons, but mainly it's because

145
00:06:08,175 --> 00:06:10,909
there's always another gear to find.

146
00:06:12,713 --> 00:06:18,117
This is what I get for relying
on a washout and a dead man.

147
00:06:18,119 --> 00:06:20,285
I don't like that guy.

148
00:06:22,823 --> 00:06:24,790
Hmm, you know.

149
00:06:24,792 --> 00:06:26,625
I'll be honest.

150
00:06:26,627 --> 00:06:29,928
Which I have to admit, I
don't have much practice in.

151
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:32,564
I don't like this situation.

152
00:06:32,566 --> 00:06:34,633
Not one bit.

153
00:06:34,635 --> 00:06:37,936
For one thing, Mr. Thawne
has this habit of treating me

154
00:06:37,938 --> 00:06:39,738
like a henchman.

155
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,541
And do you know what all
henchmen have in common,

156
00:06:42,543 --> 00:06:45,644
Captain Hunter?

157
00:06:45,646 --> 00:06:47,412
No thoughts on this one?

158
00:06:47,414 --> 00:06:49,481
The thing that all
henchmen have in common

159
00:06:49,483 --> 00:06:52,184
is that they all end up dead.

160
00:06:52,186 --> 00:06:56,288
A fate that I am
fastidiously trying to avoid.

161
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,524
Maybe it's that I just
hate taking orders.

162
00:06:58,526 --> 00:06:59,925
Or being threatened.

163
00:06:59,927 --> 00:07:02,261
You don't like being threatened, do you?

164
00:07:02,263 --> 00:07:04,463
Hm? What's that?

165
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:07,232
Oh, sorry.

166
00:07:07,234 --> 00:07:09,134
Oh, God. No.

167
00:07:09,136 --> 00:07:10,502
Yeah, neither do I.

168
00:07:10,504 --> 00:07:12,738
Which is why I need your cooperation.

169
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:16,575
To end Mr. Thawne's tedious threats.

170
00:07:16,577 --> 00:07:18,644
Look, I... I don't know anything.

171
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:21,280
- I swear.
- Shhh!

172
00:07:21,282 --> 00:07:23,315
I can't take your word for it.

173
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:24,783
But don't worry.

174
00:07:24,785 --> 00:07:29,688
I will start you off
with an easy question.

175
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:32,257
Right eye or left eye?

176
00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:34,493
No, please. Please, don't.

177
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:36,728
I'll do anything, I'll...
I'll tell you anything

178
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,230
you want to know. Even
if I don't know it!

179
00:07:38,232 --> 00:07:40,165
- Please, don't!
- Shh.

180
00:07:40,167 --> 00:07:42,201
Second question.

181
00:07:42,203 --> 00:07:45,370
When was the last time you
had any dental work done?

182
00:07:45,372 --> 00:07:48,707
What? No, no, God.

183
00:07:54,782 --> 00:07:58,283
It may not be in the best
condition, but then again,

184
00:07:58,285 --> 00:07:59,885
Captain Hunter is British.

185
00:07:59,887 --> 00:08:01,887
You pulled out his tooth?

186
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:04,690
As torture goes, isn't
that kind of bush league?

187
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:06,491
Look closer.

188
00:08:06,493 --> 00:08:08,126
Thank you, but no.

189
00:08:13,801 --> 00:08:17,569
There're some markings
on here, like a barcode.

190
00:08:17,571 --> 00:08:20,005
Account information.
From a security deposit box

191
00:08:20,007 --> 00:08:21,640
in Switzerland.

192
00:08:21,642 --> 00:08:23,909
Who puts that kind of
information on a tooth?

193
00:08:23,911 --> 00:08:25,344
A Time Master.

194
00:08:25,346 --> 00:08:26,979
That's no ordinary security box.

195
00:08:26,981 --> 00:08:28,513
My thinking exactly.

196
00:08:28,515 --> 00:08:30,282
Now, it's possible the box could contain

197
00:08:30,284 --> 00:08:32,117
his son's birth certificate
and the like, but...

198
00:08:32,119 --> 00:08:34,620
Given the exotic nature of the
care that's been taken here,

199
00:08:34,622 --> 00:08:36,889
I would have to assume...
- It's the rest of the Spear.

200
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,557
When was it last accessed?

201
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,492
January 2025.

202
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,097
Oh, you got somewhere to go?

203
00:08:45,099 --> 00:08:47,299
Funny, just like clockwork...

204
00:08:48,869 --> 00:08:50,969
Take the Time Sphere back to 2025

205
00:08:50,971 --> 00:08:53,105
and secure the rest of the Spear.

206
00:08:53,107 --> 00:08:54,539
The next one of you who screws up

207
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:57,776
will lose more than just a tooth.

208
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:02,547
Well, I'd hate to see you
lose another hand, Malcolm.

209
00:09:10,157 --> 00:09:11,924
Seriously, Grey?

210
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:15,227
I know you didn't bring me
to 2017 just so we could get

211
00:09:15,229 --> 00:09:16,628
lattes and frappuccinos, man.

212
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:17,963
Of course not.

213
00:09:17,965 --> 00:09:19,865
Just my colleague merely frequents

214
00:09:19,867 --> 00:09:21,233
this establishment at this hour.

215
00:09:22,202 --> 00:09:23,502
Sorry, Jefferson.

216
00:09:23,504 --> 00:09:24,703
You should go back to the Waverider.

217
00:09:24,705 --> 00:09:26,071
I can handle things from here.

218
00:09:26,073 --> 00:09:28,040
What the hell is going on with you, man?

219
00:09:28,042 --> 00:09:29,474
Dad?

220
00:09:29,476 --> 00:09:31,310
I didn't know you were coming to town?

221
00:09:31,312 --> 00:09:32,744
Dad?

222
00:09:32,769 --> 00:09:34,365
Well, I... I wanted to surprise you.

223
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:35,347
Oh.

224
00:09:35,349 --> 00:09:37,382
Wait. Your colleague
is your daughter?

225
00:09:37,384 --> 00:09:38,784
Lily, this is my friend Jefferson.

226
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:41,153
Jefferson, this is my daughter.

227
00:09:41,155 --> 00:09:42,554
Nice to meet you.

228
00:09:42,556 --> 00:09:44,289
Hey.

229
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:46,725
- Should we, uh, sit down?
- Yeah.

230
00:09:46,727 --> 00:09:49,761
This is... So weird.

231
00:09:49,763 --> 00:09:53,732
Uh, because I didn't think
I'd get the chance to meet you.

232
00:09:53,734 --> 00:09:56,601
Like, ever. But, uh, here we are.

233
00:09:56,603 --> 00:09:59,838
I was explaining to Jefferson
how you might be able

234
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,573
to assist us with the, um...

235
00:10:01,575 --> 00:10:03,375
Research project.

236
00:10:03,377 --> 00:10:05,377
Uh, sort of like Indiana Jones.

237
00:10:05,379 --> 00:10:08,547
Yeah, sort of.

238
00:10:08,549 --> 00:10:12,551
You brought it to a coffee shop?

239
00:10:13,854 --> 00:10:15,320
Oh, well, for one thing.

240
00:10:15,322 --> 00:10:18,557
It's throwing off low
levels of ionic radiation

241
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:20,726
Is that an ionic transmographer?

242
00:10:20,728 --> 00:10:22,794
I've never seen one
smaller than a house!

243
00:10:22,796 --> 00:10:24,863
Yeah, I had an idea
for hyperminiaturization

244
00:10:24,865 --> 00:10:26,298
when I was in Tahiti.

245
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:29,034
I don't vacation well.

246
00:10:29,036 --> 00:10:34,639
You know, I'm thinking a
shortwave ionic pulse might...

247
00:10:37,344 --> 00:10:38,710
Whoa!

248
00:10:38,712 --> 00:10:41,980
Hey.

249
00:10:41,982 --> 00:10:44,883
Perhaps we should, uh, take
our little research project

250
00:10:44,885 --> 00:10:48,620
somewhere a bit more private...

251
00:10:50,557 --> 00:10:52,991
A temporal navigation vessel.

252
00:10:52,993 --> 00:10:55,861
I... I absolutely cannot believe it.

253
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:57,129
Um, hello, who are you?

254
00:10:57,131 --> 00:10:58,663
Oh, hi. Hi, I'm Lily.

255
00:10:58,665 --> 00:11:00,165
I'm... I'm Martin's daughter.

256
00:11:00,167 --> 00:11:01,800
We didn't know Martin had a daughter.

257
00:11:01,802 --> 00:11:03,602
Yeah, you told me
you didn't have kids.

258
00:11:03,604 --> 00:11:06,004
Well, I like to keep my
private life... private.

259
00:11:06,006 --> 00:11:07,706
There's private, and there's lying.

260
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:08,907
Sara, do you know about this?

261
00:11:08,909 --> 00:11:12,978
Oh, I know all about this.

262
00:11:16,417 --> 00:11:17,416
What are you doing?

263
00:11:17,418 --> 00:11:19,051
Trying to make up my mind.

264
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,353
I mean, Eobard has
such a delicious selection

265
00:11:21,355 --> 00:11:22,721
of killing devices.

266
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:24,256
We can't just storm into the bank

267
00:11:24,258 --> 00:11:26,091
and demand to see the deposit box.

268
00:11:26,093 --> 00:11:27,626
We absolutely can.

269
00:11:27,628 --> 00:11:29,327
We're former members of
the League of Assassins.

270
00:11:29,329 --> 00:11:31,596
This operation requires subtlety.

271
00:11:31,598 --> 00:11:33,331
Not a bloodbath.

272
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,967
Well, I... I'm sorry. I'm
not up on current events,

273
00:11:35,969 --> 00:11:38,703
But might this squeamishness
that I'm witnessing

274
00:11:38,705 --> 00:11:40,439
be the cause of your downfall?

275
00:11:40,441 --> 00:11:41,907
Hunter is an asset.

276
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:44,709
One that we can use to gain
access to our objective.

277
00:11:44,711 --> 00:11:46,945
To not use him is foolish.

278
00:11:46,947 --> 00:11:48,947
Oh. Well, in that case,

279
00:11:48,949 --> 00:11:51,616
I would have to defer to
your superior expertise

280
00:11:51,618 --> 00:11:53,819
in foolishness.

281
00:11:53,821 --> 00:11:57,289
But if your plan goes south,
it's not our speedster friend

282
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:59,724
you need to worry about.

283
00:11:59,726 --> 00:12:01,226
One thing I hate more

284
00:12:01,228 --> 00:12:04,729
than taking orders from him...

285
00:12:04,731 --> 00:12:06,398
is being threatened by you.

286
00:12:12,473 --> 00:12:16,908
Luckily, Damien...

287
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,343
I don't find you threatening.

288
00:12:31,121 --> 00:12:32,324
What's the big deal?

289
00:12:32,349 --> 00:12:35,111
The professor didn't
have a kid, now he does.

290
00:12:35,113 --> 00:12:36,145
Mazel tov.

291
00:12:36,147 --> 00:12:37,027
Thank you.

292
00:12:37,052 --> 00:12:39,882
The big deal is Lily
is a Time Aberration,

293
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,917
which was all well and good,

294
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:45,821
until you plucked her out of
2016 and showed her a timeship,

295
00:12:45,823 --> 00:12:48,958
which could cause more aberrations.

296
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,326
Hey, what you looking at me for?

297
00:12:50,328 --> 00:12:51,627
Because you were with him.

298
00:12:51,629 --> 00:12:53,596
I quite simply missed my daughter.

299
00:12:53,598 --> 00:12:55,398
If Lily's presence
on the Waverider posed

300
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,299
any temporal issues, I'm sure Gideon

301
00:12:57,301 --> 00:12:58,901
would have detected them.

302
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:01,670
Plus, Grey said Lily
could hook the Medallion

303
00:13:01,672 --> 00:13:03,339
up with Gideon, so...

304
00:13:03,341 --> 00:13:05,307
Wait, she wants to try
networking an ancient amulet

305
00:13:05,309 --> 00:13:06,776
with an advanced AI system?

306
00:13:08,112 --> 00:13:09,612
I'm totally helping.

307
00:13:09,614 --> 00:13:12,048
Fine. Then I would
appreciate it if you...

308
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:16,218
If none of you would reveal to
her that she's an Aberration.

309
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,500
Why you looking at me?

310
00:13:17,525 --> 00:13:19,789
So where are we on
identifying the speedster?

311
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:21,857
I think the technical term is nowhere.

312
00:13:21,859 --> 00:13:23,292
All the speedsters the Flash faced

313
00:13:23,294 --> 00:13:25,227
are either dead or his friends.

314
00:13:25,229 --> 00:13:27,863
Or people he thought were
his friends and are now dead.

315
00:13:27,865 --> 00:13:30,132
Okay, we will figure this
out. And in the meantime,

316
00:13:30,134 --> 00:13:32,334
you and Lily keep working
with the amulet to figure out

317
00:13:32,336 --> 00:13:34,403
to figure out where the
rest of the Spear is.

318
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,274
Who's to say he won't kill us anyway?

319
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:42,778
Even after we've gotten
his precious spear?

320
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,847
Oh, forget it. Why am I asking you?

321
00:13:44,849 --> 00:13:46,782
I don't know, man.
I don't know anything.

322
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,751
I don't even know why you're
getting me to wear this...

323
00:13:48,753 --> 00:13:51,253
This... this... this...
This monkey suit.

324
00:13:51,255 --> 00:13:53,089
And my mouth is so sore.

325
00:13:53,091 --> 00:13:55,124
Quit whining.

326
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:56,425
The fact of the matter is,

327
00:13:56,427 --> 00:13:58,594
we have something in common, Rip.

328
00:13:58,596 --> 00:13:59,628
My name is Phil.

329
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,996
Whatever.

330
00:14:00,998 --> 00:14:02,832
We are both dealing with
unstable individuals.

331
00:14:02,834 --> 00:14:05,935
And that is not something I enjoy.

332
00:14:05,937 --> 00:14:08,904
Hey, this is not exactly a
walk in the park for me, either.

333
00:14:08,906 --> 00:14:11,373
Which is why

334
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:15,711
you will do exactly as I say.

335
00:14:15,713 --> 00:14:18,247
And maybe, just maybe,

336
00:14:18,249 --> 00:14:20,483
you will make it through this alive.

337
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:22,418
Cool. Right.

338
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:25,588
Um, what... what is
it you want me to do?

339
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:28,290
Tell me, Phil. Have you ever been

340
00:14:28,292 --> 00:14:29,658
to Switzerland?

341
00:14:40,404 --> 00:14:41,737
Put this in your ear.

342
00:14:41,739 --> 00:14:42,838
What is it?

343
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,039
Communication device.

344
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:46,242
Really? It's so small...

345
00:14:46,244 --> 00:14:48,277
Do it, or I'll shove
it down your throat.

346
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:50,312
It will allow us to monitor you.

347
00:14:50,314 --> 00:14:52,047
This is very simple.

348
00:14:52,049 --> 00:14:54,416
You go to the bank
associate and you tell them

349
00:14:54,418 --> 00:14:57,086
you want to access security box 4587.

350
00:14:57,088 --> 00:14:58,654
4587, right.

351
00:14:58,656 --> 00:15:00,422
Um, what... What do I do then?

352
00:15:00,424 --> 00:15:01,991
Bring the contents
of said box back to us.

353
00:15:01,993 --> 00:15:03,526
If you don't, you'll be killed.

354
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:04,727
Really?

355
00:15:04,729 --> 00:15:06,195
What? I'm motivating him.

356
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:07,463
In and out.

357
00:15:07,465 --> 00:15:08,597
Take no longer than five minutes.

358
00:15:08,599 --> 00:15:10,299
You will be fine.

359
00:15:10,301 --> 00:15:12,201
I'll be fine.

360
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:14,036
I'll be fine. Okay.

361
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:17,373
This would be easier if
we just killed everybody.

362
00:15:19,644 --> 00:15:21,143
Hi, how are you?

363
00:15:21,145 --> 00:15:25,481
I'd like box 4587, please.

364
00:15:25,483 --> 00:15:27,016
Well, sure, have a seat.

365
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,886
What do you think's going on with him?

366
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,923
It's simple. His mind is pudding.

367
00:15:33,925 --> 00:15:35,925
Not Hunter. Thawne.

368
00:15:35,927 --> 00:15:38,627
It's strange how he never stays
in one place for very long...

369
00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:41,430
Perhaps that's why they
refer to them as speedsters.

370
00:15:41,432 --> 00:15:44,867
What, you think he left us
behind in 1967, Los Angeles,

371
00:15:44,869 --> 00:15:47,503
because he had a more
pressing engagement?

372
00:15:47,505 --> 00:15:49,271
What about what he said to us earlier?

373
00:15:49,273 --> 00:15:50,873
That he wanted to kill one of us?

374
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:53,542
No. That he didn't know
why he was relying on us.

375
00:15:53,544 --> 00:15:55,177
I mean, fair question.

376
00:15:55,179 --> 00:15:56,545
Why does a time traveling speedster

377
00:15:56,547 --> 00:15:58,747
need to rely on anyone?

378
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:01,150
Thawne's hiding something.

379
00:16:01,152 --> 00:16:02,818
Wouldn't you like to know what it is?

380
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:07,323
Thawne said we knew
each other back in 2016.

381
00:16:07,325 --> 00:16:08,991
Do I really become so stupid

382
00:16:08,993 --> 00:16:10,727
that you think these mind
tricks will work on me?

383
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,976
I am not trying to...

384
00:16:12,001 --> 00:16:14,330
In a trio such as ours,
turning one against each other

385
00:16:14,332 --> 00:16:16,999
for your own benefit is not
only obvious, but cliché.

386
00:16:17,001 --> 00:16:19,635
Thawne does not treat
us as equals to him.

387
00:16:19,637 --> 00:16:23,372
And until he does, neither of
us is getting what he wants.

388
00:16:25,509 --> 00:16:27,543
All right. Let's go over this again.

389
00:16:27,545 --> 00:16:29,411
I already been over it, Sara.

390
00:16:29,413 --> 00:16:30,713
Mm-hmm, again and again.

391
00:16:30,715 --> 00:16:32,147
And again.

392
00:16:32,149 --> 00:16:34,550
We're obviously dealing
with a new player.

393
00:16:34,552 --> 00:16:36,352
Whoever this speedster
is, it's someone you

394
00:16:36,354 --> 00:16:38,053
and your friends haven't
encountered before.

395
00:16:38,055 --> 00:16:40,022
Which means the
speedster's from the future,

396
00:16:40,024 --> 00:16:42,758
which makes sense, because
speedsters can time travel.

397
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,160
Then would the speedster
need the Spear of Destiny for?

398
00:16:45,162 --> 00:16:47,396
He could just go back and
change history himself.

399
00:16:47,398 --> 00:16:48,764
But not reality.

400
00:16:48,766 --> 00:16:50,666
That's why he needs the Spear.

401
00:16:50,668 --> 00:16:53,669
Question is, what is the
speedster trying to change?

402
00:16:55,373 --> 00:16:57,039
Or fix?

403
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:59,008
That's the question.

404
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:01,076
He knows what we want to do
with the Spear of Destiny,

405
00:17:01,078 --> 00:17:03,245
but he's being very coy about his plans.

406
00:17:12,957 --> 00:17:15,758
Very well, Mr. Hunter.

407
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,627
Please lean towards
the panel, if you would.

408
00:17:18,629 --> 00:17:20,129
Excuse me?

409
00:17:20,131 --> 00:17:21,497
A retinal scan.

410
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:23,532
- Rectal scanner?
- What?

411
00:17:23,534 --> 00:17:26,502
It's an eye scan. Part
of the bank's security.

412
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:27,569
You know,

413
00:17:27,571 --> 00:17:28,937
this whole situation sucks,

414
00:17:28,939 --> 00:17:31,573
but man, I love being in the future.

415
00:17:31,575 --> 00:17:34,843
- What?
- What?

416
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:37,446
Retinal scan. Right.

417
00:17:40,484 --> 00:17:43,986
Oh.

418
00:17:46,824 --> 00:17:50,426
Why, uh... Why is it not working?

419
00:17:50,428 --> 00:17:51,794
Voice ID is next.

420
00:17:51,796 --> 00:17:54,797
You need to speak your access code.

421
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,098
Access code.

422
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,333
Oh, boy.

423
00:17:57,335 --> 00:17:59,134
Oh, boy.

424
00:17:59,136 --> 00:18:02,104
Yes, so, the one you set
when you opened your account.

425
00:18:02,106 --> 00:18:03,238
Uh...

426
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,940
Get out of there now.

427
00:18:04,942 --> 00:18:06,442
Yeah.

428
00:18:06,444 --> 00:18:10,713
No, don't.

429
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:12,548
Go. Move.

430
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,983
Don't.

431
00:18:14,985 --> 00:18:16,316
This was your plan.

432
00:18:16,341 --> 00:18:18,220
Which I am trying to execute.

433
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,823
And failing spectacularly, per usual.

434
00:18:20,825 --> 00:18:23,826
Look, we can't just
let them call security.

435
00:18:23,828 --> 00:18:25,394
I am calling security.

436
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:27,162
Great idea. Security, no, that's...

437
00:18:27,164 --> 00:18:28,797
Security is awesome.

438
00:18:32,837 --> 00:18:35,637
You aren't planning on going
rogue on us, now, were you, Rip?

439
00:18:35,639 --> 00:18:38,574
I have told you. My name is Phil.

440
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:40,275
All right, Phil. It
was lovely knowing you.

441
00:18:40,277 --> 00:18:41,477
Don't! We still need him.

442
00:18:41,479 --> 00:18:43,011
He's useless to us.

443
00:18:43,013 --> 00:18:44,513
Hey, I can be more useful.

444
00:18:44,538 --> 00:18:45,635
Ah, damn it.

445
00:18:45,637 --> 00:18:47,783
Security is gonna be on
top of us at any moment.

446
00:18:47,785 --> 00:18:49,952
Might I suggest you kill them instead?

447
00:18:49,954 --> 00:18:51,887
Try and run, and I will find you

448
00:18:51,889 --> 00:18:53,956
and feed you your testicles.

449
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:55,891
Okay.

450
00:18:55,893 --> 00:18:57,493
Oh, my God.

451
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:01,797
Ahh!

452
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:03,732
- Ahh!
- Ahh!

453
00:19:16,147 --> 00:19:17,679
Reinforcements are on their way.

454
00:19:17,681 --> 00:19:20,516
Let's get the hell out of here.

455
00:19:34,617 --> 00:19:37,825
Okay, that should just about do it.

456
00:19:37,827 --> 00:19:39,694
And now we just have
to activate the Medallion

457
00:19:39,696 --> 00:19:41,696
and see if Gideon can access its data.

458
00:19:41,698 --> 00:19:44,332
Okay.

459
00:19:44,334 --> 00:19:48,402
So what are we waiting for?

460
00:19:48,404 --> 00:19:50,605
Nothing, it... It's just if...

461
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:53,174
If we've underestimated the size
of the artifact's data stream...

462
00:19:53,176 --> 00:19:55,376
We'll fry the ship's
CPU and we'll all spend

463
00:19:55,378 --> 00:19:57,645
the rest of our lives
stranded in the Temporal Zone.

464
00:19:57,647 --> 00:19:59,671
The ship's CPU has a name.

465
00:19:59,696 --> 00:20:00,672
Sorry, Gideon.

466
00:20:00,697 --> 00:20:02,784
Can we at least talk about
this before you connect...

467
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:09,123
Gideon?

468
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,858
You still there?

469
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:13,027
Oh, my God, we killed her.

470
00:20:13,029 --> 00:20:15,630
Artificial intelligences
cannot, by definition,

471
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:17,092
be killed, Dr. Palmer.

472
00:20:17,117 --> 00:20:17,961
Yes, I know.

473
00:20:17,986 --> 00:20:20,334
It's pretty remarkable
considering we just mainlined

474
00:20:20,336 --> 00:20:23,104
1.2 zettabytes directly into her brain.

475
00:20:23,106 --> 00:20:23,937
Yeah.

476
00:20:23,962 --> 00:20:26,541
I'm processing the Medallion's
temporal output as we speak.

477
00:20:28,411 --> 00:20:31,075
- Nice work, doctor.
- Doctor!

478
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,714
You don't happen to have any
champagne on this ship, do you?

479
00:20:35,018 --> 00:20:37,218
Hey.

480
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:40,688
Ah, 1998 Blanc de Noir.

481
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:42,824
I like beer.

482
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:44,992
Gets me drunk.

483
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:49,530
To Lily.

484
00:20:49,532 --> 00:20:51,465
To Gideon.

485
00:20:55,238 --> 00:20:57,171
Wow.

486
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:58,306
That tastes real.

487
00:20:58,308 --> 00:20:59,607
It's completely synthetic.

488
00:20:59,609 --> 00:21:01,709
The food fabricator can make anything.

489
00:21:01,711 --> 00:21:03,477
Except American Cheese,

490
00:21:03,479 --> 00:21:05,680
which is pretty much
synthetic to being with.

491
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:07,114
Beluga caviar?

492
00:21:07,116 --> 00:21:09,217
Fake food never tasted so good.

493
00:21:09,219 --> 00:21:11,152
Fake food for a fake person.

494
00:21:14,524 --> 00:21:16,123
What did you say?

495
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:18,100
Uh, no. He didn't say anything.

496
00:21:19,429 --> 00:21:21,896
Everyone has been looking
at me weird ever since

497
00:21:21,898 --> 00:21:24,342
I came on board this ship.

498
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:26,267
What are you not telling me?

499
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:28,836
Cat's out of the bag, Haircut.

500
00:21:28,838 --> 00:21:30,071
You may as well tell her.

501
00:21:30,073 --> 00:21:31,706
Tell me what?

502
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:34,742
Tell me what?

503
00:21:34,744 --> 00:21:38,012
Sweetheart, I don't
wanna rain on your parade,

504
00:21:38,014 --> 00:21:39,814
but you're a, uh...

505
00:21:39,816 --> 00:21:42,316
How would the Professor put it?

506
00:21:42,318 --> 00:21:44,552
An abrasion... No, that's not it, um...

507
00:21:44,554 --> 00:21:46,854
An asphyxiation, hmm...

508
00:21:46,856 --> 00:21:48,489
Aber... Aberration!

509
00:21:48,491 --> 00:21:52,994
You're a Time Aberration.
You're a Time Aberration.

510
00:21:52,996 --> 00:21:55,596
Ray?

511
00:21:55,598 --> 00:21:58,199
What is a Time Aberration?

512
00:21:58,201 --> 00:22:01,535
Um, I think maybe you
should talk to your dad.

513
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:09,810
Perhaps we could all just
talk about what went wrong.

514
00:22:09,812 --> 00:22:11,379
- Shh!
- Oh, I know what went wrong.

515
00:22:11,381 --> 00:22:13,047
I listened to him.

516
00:22:13,049 --> 00:22:15,025
If you'd have listened to
me, we would have walked out

517
00:22:15,049 --> 00:22:16,629
of that bank instead
of being chased out.

518
00:22:16,653 --> 00:22:19,654
Either way, we came out empty-handed.

519
00:22:19,656 --> 00:22:21,689
I seem to remember Eobard mentioning

520
00:22:21,691 --> 00:22:23,724
how he was going to punish your failure.

521
00:22:23,726 --> 00:22:25,626
If anyone's a failure, it's you.

522
00:22:25,628 --> 00:22:28,262
You were the one who learned
about Hunter's secret account,

523
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:31,966
yet seem not to know about a passcode.

524
00:22:31,968 --> 00:22:33,434
Sloppy, Damien.

525
00:22:33,436 --> 00:22:35,136
No wonder they passed
you over for Ra's...

526
00:22:35,138 --> 00:22:37,305
You see, this is where he reminds me

527
00:22:37,307 --> 00:22:38,906
that he was Ra's al Ghul.

528
00:22:38,908 --> 00:22:41,075
Poor Malcolm. Always living in the past.

529
00:22:41,077 --> 00:22:44,412
This is when I remind
you about your future.

530
00:22:44,414 --> 00:22:46,948
Aww, that's right.

531
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,582
I've been there.

532
00:22:48,584 --> 00:22:50,051
I've seen how pathetic you are.

533
00:22:50,053 --> 00:22:52,019
In this future that you're from,

534
00:22:52,021 --> 00:22:56,023
do I at least have two hands?

535
00:22:56,025 --> 00:22:59,961
Either way, I intend to change
my future, but look at you now.

536
00:22:59,963 --> 00:23:01,796
You're pathetic. I don't even know

537
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:03,764
why Thawne recruited
you in the first place.

538
00:23:03,766 --> 00:23:05,166
We could argue all night, Damien,

539
00:23:05,168 --> 00:23:07,468
but I don't want to bore our guest here

540
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:12,073
with your impotent
insults and recriminations.

541
00:23:12,075 --> 00:23:13,941
What are you suggesting?

542
00:23:13,943 --> 00:23:16,010
Do you recall how we resolved
disputes within the League?

543
00:23:16,012 --> 00:23:17,611
Mm-hmm.

544
00:23:17,613 --> 00:23:18,579
Now...

545
00:23:19,882 --> 00:23:22,116
I suggest you choose a blade

546
00:23:22,118 --> 00:23:24,618
that matches that sharp tongue of yours.

547
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:27,288
Excuse me for a second.

548
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:28,856
Gladly.

549
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,493
You did it, my darling!

550
00:23:32,495 --> 00:23:34,962
You created an interface
between a mystical relic

551
00:23:34,964 --> 00:23:38,733
from the first century and
a 22nd century supercomputer.

552
00:23:38,735 --> 00:23:40,668
Only a Stein could be so brilliant!

553
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:43,471
What is a Time Aberration?

554
00:23:43,473 --> 00:23:44,705
I'm sorry, what?

555
00:23:44,707 --> 00:23:48,042
You heard me, Dad.

556
00:23:48,044 --> 00:23:51,312
An Aberration... Is
an unnatural alteration

557
00:23:51,314 --> 00:23:54,215
of history as a result of time travel.

558
00:23:54,217 --> 00:23:58,886
Dad? Am I...

559
00:23:58,888 --> 00:24:00,654
Am I an Aberration?

560
00:24:00,656 --> 00:24:04,825
That word could never
describe who you are

561
00:24:04,827 --> 00:24:07,128
or how much you mean to me.

562
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:09,130
- So it's true?
- Please let me explain.

563
00:24:09,132 --> 00:24:13,334
That's why you were acting so weird

564
00:24:13,336 --> 00:24:15,569
when you visited Central
City the first time.

565
00:24:15,571 --> 00:24:18,139
The reason you were
treating me like a stranger...

566
00:24:18,141 --> 00:24:20,274
Was because you didn't
even exist the last time

567
00:24:20,276 --> 00:24:23,144
I boarded this ship
and... And left 2016.

568
00:24:23,146 --> 00:24:26,013
But now you do exist and
that's all that matters.

569
00:24:26,015 --> 00:24:27,782
How could this be happening?

570
00:24:27,784 --> 00:24:29,984
But it's... it's... It's
really quite simple.

571
00:24:29,986 --> 00:24:34,388
You see, I interacted with
my younger self back in 1987.

572
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:37,558
And who then interacted with
your mother's former self.

573
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,260
And, and...

574
00:24:39,262 --> 00:24:41,162
When two former selves
love each other...

575
00:24:41,164 --> 00:24:43,364
Okay, Dad. We've already
had the birds and bees talk.

576
00:24:43,366 --> 00:24:46,500
I was ten. Or did we?

577
00:24:46,502 --> 00:24:48,536
That's a very interesting point.

578
00:24:48,538 --> 00:24:51,906
I... I mean, who is to say
which of our realities is real

579
00:24:51,908 --> 00:24:54,141
and which one is aberrant?

580
00:24:54,143 --> 00:24:56,110
It's really a matter of perspective.

581
00:24:56,112 --> 00:24:57,745
Actually, it's quite fascinating.

582
00:24:57,747 --> 00:25:00,781
This is not fascinating, Dad!

583
00:25:00,783 --> 00:25:03,217
This is a nightmare.

584
00:25:03,219 --> 00:25:04,919
Oh, Lily, I'm so sorry.

585
00:25:04,921 --> 00:25:06,921
This is not how I
wanted you to find out.

586
00:25:06,923 --> 00:25:09,590
No. No, I get it.

587
00:25:09,592 --> 00:25:11,192
You didn't want kids

588
00:25:11,194 --> 00:25:16,097
when you first came
on board this timeship.

589
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:20,401
And now you have me.

590
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:42,756
You just reminded me of something.

591
00:25:42,758 --> 00:25:43,958
Which is?

592
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,160
How much I've missed this.

593
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:13,621
Okay, stop, stop! Time out, time out!

594
00:26:13,623 --> 00:26:15,990
Can't you see that this
is what your boss wants?

595
00:26:15,992 --> 00:26:18,626
For his underlings to be
at one another's throats.

596
00:26:18,628 --> 00:26:20,928
Like, literally.

597
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:22,129
He is not our boss.

598
00:26:22,131 --> 00:26:23,230
Did he call us underlings?

599
00:26:23,232 --> 00:26:24,565
Oh, I'm sorry.

600
00:26:24,567 --> 00:26:28,169
Uh... Henchmen.

601
00:26:28,171 --> 00:26:29,537
Try again.

602
00:26:29,539 --> 00:26:30,671
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

603
00:26:30,673 --> 00:26:31,705
What if he's right?

604
00:26:31,707 --> 00:26:33,007
You actually care

605
00:26:33,009 --> 00:26:34,642
what this pudding-brained
hippie has to say?

606
00:26:34,644 --> 00:26:36,043
It's just like the movie

607
00:26:36,045 --> 00:26:37,645
â€œThe Good, the Bad, and the Uglyâ€

608
00:26:37,647 --> 00:26:38,779
Three bad guys.

609
00:26:38,781 --> 00:26:40,381
No one knows who to trust.

610
00:26:40,383 --> 00:26:42,449
So they all end up
screwing each other over.

611
00:26:42,451 --> 00:26:44,385
It's an interesting theory.

612
00:26:44,387 --> 00:26:46,020
Which one are we?

613
00:26:46,022 --> 00:26:47,988
The point is that neither
of you are Clint Eastwood

614
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:51,091
and so neither of you end
up going home with the gold.

615
00:26:51,093 --> 00:26:52,693
We're not after the gold.

616
00:26:52,695 --> 00:26:53,727
Yeah, I know, I know.

617
00:26:53,729 --> 00:26:55,162
I know what you're after.

618
00:26:55,164 --> 00:26:57,798
You... You wanna change your past.

619
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,634
And you... You wanna change your future.

620
00:27:00,636 --> 00:27:02,336
And, uh, the fast guy is the only one

621
00:27:02,338 --> 00:27:06,507
who could make those
two things, uh, happen.

622
00:27:06,509 --> 00:27:08,075
I told you.

623
00:27:08,077 --> 00:27:09,810
Thawne doesn't treat us as equals.

624
00:27:09,812 --> 00:27:11,645
Even the hippie knows it.

625
00:27:11,647 --> 00:27:13,847
And he also knows that
the only way to stop Thawne

626
00:27:13,849 --> 00:27:18,152
from screwing us over is
for us to work together.

627
00:27:18,154 --> 00:27:21,155
Two former members of
the League of Assassins

628
00:27:21,157 --> 00:27:22,823
versus a speedster.

629
00:27:24,827 --> 00:27:26,486
I am liking those odds.

630
00:27:35,589 --> 00:27:38,290
Dude, what is going on with you?

631
00:27:38,292 --> 00:27:40,526
What do you mean?
And don't call me dude.

632
00:27:40,528 --> 00:27:42,528
I've gotten used to
sharing a brain with you.

633
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:44,863
But, this, whatever this is.

634
00:27:44,865 --> 00:27:46,265
This is something new.

635
00:27:46,267 --> 00:27:49,801
Just enjoying a cup of Earl Grey.

636
00:27:49,803 --> 00:27:51,136
Is that whiskey?

637
00:27:51,138 --> 00:27:53,005
Of course it's not whiskey.

638
00:27:53,007 --> 00:27:55,173
It's brandy. What do you
take me for, a sailor?

639
00:27:55,175 --> 00:27:58,377
Okay. Let's start this over, hmm?

640
00:27:59,613 --> 00:28:01,513
Come on.

641
00:28:01,515 --> 00:28:05,784
Fine.

642
00:28:05,786 --> 00:28:07,672
I made a terrible mistake.

643
00:28:08,989 --> 00:28:11,089
I should never have brought
Lily on board this ship.

644
00:28:11,091 --> 00:28:14,293
She found out.

645
00:28:14,295 --> 00:28:16,161
She knows she's an Aberration.

646
00:28:16,163 --> 00:28:19,932
Mr. Rory spilled the
beans, as predicted.

647
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:26,305
So what you gonna do?

648
00:28:26,307 --> 00:28:28,040
What can I do?

649
00:28:28,042 --> 00:28:29,241
Just tell her how you feel.

650
00:28:29,243 --> 00:28:30,542
She knows how I feel.

651
00:28:30,544 --> 00:28:31,777
It goes without saying.

652
00:28:31,779 --> 00:28:33,779
Yeah, for us, it does.

653
00:28:33,781 --> 00:28:36,415
We have a psychic
connection, but for her?

654
00:28:36,417 --> 00:28:40,819
She just hears whatever comes
out of that big brain of yours.

655
00:28:40,821 --> 00:28:42,854
Just tell her you love her.

656
00:28:42,856 --> 00:28:44,289
That's what dads do.

657
00:28:44,291 --> 00:28:46,525
Clearly, you never met my father.

658
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,630
You know, the...

659
00:28:51,632 --> 00:28:54,333
The reason Clarissa and I
chose not to have children

660
00:28:54,335 --> 00:28:57,769
the first time around was because...

661
00:28:57,771 --> 00:29:00,339
I feared that history
would repeat itself,

662
00:29:00,341 --> 00:29:02,140
that I would be

663
00:29:02,142 --> 00:29:04,509
the kind of father that he was.

664
00:29:06,614 --> 00:29:10,248
We're legends, Grey.

665
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,850
Changing history is what we do.

666
00:29:21,185 --> 00:29:23,457
Why would a speedster
need to change reality?

667
00:29:23,482 --> 00:29:26,398
Ohh. How many times are
you gonna ask that question?

668
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,734
Until we have an answer.

669
00:29:28,736 --> 00:29:30,936
She's right. Speedsters can time travel.

670
00:29:30,938 --> 00:29:33,238
So what's stopping him
from changing history

671
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,207
even without the Spear?

672
00:29:38,245 --> 00:29:40,946
Unless he doesn't exist.

673
00:29:40,948 --> 00:29:42,614
Okay, so what, he's a ghost?

674
00:29:42,616 --> 00:29:43,815
What if he's a Temporal Aberration?

675
00:29:43,817 --> 00:29:45,317
- Just like...
- Excuse me.

676
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:46,628
Have any of you seen my daughter?

677
00:29:46,652 --> 00:29:47,953
- One second, Professor.
- I'm sorry!

678
00:29:47,955 --> 00:29:49,121
This is quite urgent.

679
00:29:49,123 --> 00:29:50,622
Look, what if instead of

680
00:29:50,624 --> 00:29:52,557
creating a person
like you did with Lily,

681
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:55,327
our mystery speedster
erased himself from history?

682
00:29:55,329 --> 00:29:56,828
Why would he want to do that?

683
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:58,463
I don't know, but it would explain

684
00:29:58,465 --> 00:30:01,066
why we don't have any
evidence of his existence.

685
00:30:01,068 --> 00:30:05,070
Okay, so, we just need to
ID someone who doesn't exist?

686
00:30:05,072 --> 00:30:07,406
Eobard Thawne.

687
00:30:07,408 --> 00:30:09,107
Um, is... Is he okay?

688
00:30:09,109 --> 00:30:11,343
I'm fine. Eobard Thawne is a name.

689
00:30:11,345 --> 00:30:14,413
The name of a speedster who...

690
00:30:14,415 --> 00:30:15,414
Who what?

691
00:30:17,718 --> 00:30:20,852
Thawne was erased from
existence when his progenitor,

692
00:30:20,854 --> 00:30:24,089
Eddie Thawne, committed
suicide in order to stop him.

693
00:30:24,091 --> 00:30:25,891
Which would explain why

694
00:30:25,893 --> 00:30:27,959
the Time Masters didn't
have a file on him.

695
00:30:27,961 --> 00:30:29,661
But if Thawne doesn't exist, then how?

696
00:30:29,663 --> 00:30:31,697
He was protected from
his ancestor's death

697
00:30:31,699 --> 00:30:33,498
because he was a member
of the Speed Force.

698
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,401
It's a little complicated.

699
00:30:36,403 --> 00:30:39,204
A little?

700
00:30:44,278 --> 00:30:45,877
Oh, and for the record,

701
00:30:45,879 --> 00:30:48,280
this is how I wanted to approach
things in the first place.

702
00:30:48,282 --> 00:30:50,549
Only because you enjoy
killing a lot of people.

703
00:30:50,551 --> 00:30:51,950
As if you don't.

704
00:30:55,756 --> 00:30:57,279
Hmm.

705
00:30:57,304 --> 00:30:59,391
All right, that's pretty
impressive, Malcolm.

706
00:30:59,393 --> 00:31:01,004
But how did you get Hunter's passcode?

707
00:31:01,029 --> 00:31:02,394
It's not Hunter's.

708
00:31:02,396 --> 00:31:05,097
It's the bank manager's
security override code.

709
00:31:05,099 --> 00:31:06,998
It only cost him three fingers.

710
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:13,805
Uh, yes!

711
00:31:13,807 --> 00:31:14,906
Ow!

712
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:18,176
Oh, God.

713
00:31:23,817 --> 00:31:25,283
Going somewhere?

714
00:31:25,285 --> 00:31:26,151
No.

715
00:31:27,955 --> 00:31:29,554
Yes.

716
00:31:29,556 --> 00:31:31,389
What do you expect me to do?

717
00:31:31,391 --> 00:31:35,227
Your partners just left
me here all tied up.

718
00:31:35,229 --> 00:31:37,429
Where are they?

719
00:31:37,431 --> 00:31:40,298
They... told me...

720
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,033
Not to tell you.

721
00:31:43,504 --> 00:31:45,270
The bank. They're...
They're at the bank.

722
00:31:45,272 --> 00:31:47,272
Look, you could help yourself

723
00:31:47,274 --> 00:31:50,675
to... to whatever is in that
safe deposit box, but please...

724
00:31:50,677 --> 00:31:52,344
Please, just... Just let me go, man.

725
00:31:52,346 --> 00:31:53,512
Let me go.

726
00:32:08,629 --> 00:32:11,163
Does this look like a spear to you?

727
00:32:13,367 --> 00:32:15,200
It most certainly does not.

728
00:32:15,202 --> 00:32:16,802
It's a mnemonic archive.

729
00:32:16,804 --> 00:32:18,870
I'm sorry, are we supposed
to know what that means?

730
00:32:18,872 --> 00:32:21,173
Since it won't be
invented for a century, no.

731
00:32:21,175 --> 00:32:23,608
This device is designed
to store memories.

732
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:25,343
Rip Hunter's, I'd assume.

733
00:32:27,181 --> 00:32:28,814
Guys, I think I just figured it out.

734
00:32:28,816 --> 00:32:31,116
Why a seemingly invincible speedster

735
00:32:31,118 --> 00:32:32,717
would need to take on partners.

736
00:32:32,719 --> 00:32:34,686
By all means, Dr. Heywood,
please enlighten us.

737
00:32:34,688 --> 00:32:37,322
Okay. What if Thawne
isn't just chasing us?

738
00:32:37,324 --> 00:32:39,391
What if he's running from something?

739
00:32:39,393 --> 00:32:41,026
But running from what?

740
00:32:41,028 --> 00:32:42,260
Time.

741
00:32:42,262 --> 00:32:44,029
Time takes time to harden.

742
00:32:44,031 --> 00:32:45,797
And if Thawne ceased to exist the moment

743
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:47,199
his great-great-whatever
killed himself,

744
00:32:47,201 --> 00:32:50,402
then, maybe, he has to keep moving

745
00:32:50,404 --> 00:32:52,237
in order for his own nonexistence

746
00:32:52,239 --> 00:32:55,407
not to catch up with him. Poo!

747
00:32:55,409 --> 00:32:57,976
That doesn't even begin
to make any kind of sense.

748
00:32:57,978 --> 00:33:00,145
I don't know, it could work.

749
00:33:00,147 --> 00:33:02,647
Professor, what do you think?

750
00:33:02,649 --> 00:33:03,915
Per the scientific method,

751
00:33:03,917 --> 00:33:05,884
there's only one way to prove it.

752
00:33:05,886 --> 00:33:09,654
You'd have to trap Thawne in one
place and then see what happens.

753
00:33:12,593 --> 00:33:14,326
What do you think you're doing?

754
00:33:14,328 --> 00:33:16,795
Renegotiating the
terms of our partnership.

755
00:33:16,797 --> 00:33:19,397
And it is going to be a partnership.

756
00:33:19,399 --> 00:33:21,199
We need a bit more of a guarantee

757
00:33:21,201 --> 00:33:24,002
that you're going to uphold
your end of our bargain.

758
00:33:26,907 --> 00:33:29,574
I'll guarantee you one thing.

759
00:33:29,576 --> 00:33:31,776
If you don't open that door,

760
00:33:31,778 --> 00:33:34,112
I'll kill you.

761
00:33:34,114 --> 00:33:38,350
Yes, but I'm the only one
who knows the code to open it.

762
00:33:40,988 --> 00:33:43,021
Perhaps you can persuade
our friend to cooperate?

763
00:33:43,023 --> 00:33:43,855
Me? No.

764
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,280
I'd rather see how this plays out.

765
00:33:46,305 --> 00:33:48,560
Aww.

766
00:33:48,562 --> 00:33:50,495
It seems you two have
formed an alliance.

767
00:33:50,497 --> 00:33:52,130
There's just one problem.

768
00:33:52,132 --> 00:33:53,365
That you're the only
one who could give us

769
00:33:53,367 --> 00:33:54,866
what we want... Yes, we know.

770
00:33:54,868 --> 00:33:56,401
You're always so quick to remind us

771
00:33:56,403 --> 00:33:59,237
how much we need you, Eobard.

772
00:33:59,239 --> 00:34:01,172
But, clearly, you need us.

773
00:34:01,174 --> 00:34:03,008
You could have gotten in
this vault all by yourself.

774
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:03,975
Why didn't you?

775
00:34:05,646 --> 00:34:07,245
And for that matter...

776
00:34:07,247 --> 00:34:09,648
why would a man who
can travel through time

777
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:11,116
always be in such a hurry?

778
00:34:11,118 --> 00:34:12,651
We don't have time for this.

779
00:34:12,653 --> 00:34:15,287
Oh, I've got all the time in the world.

780
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,492
Okay!

781
00:34:23,494 --> 00:34:26,262
Okay, you two have made your point.

782
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:29,265
I need you as much as
you need me, all right.

783
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:31,500
But if you do not open that door,

784
00:34:31,502 --> 00:34:32,768
he is going to kill us.

785
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:34,169
He is coming for me!

786
00:34:34,171 --> 00:34:35,671
Who's coming for you?

787
00:34:35,673 --> 00:34:37,406
It's not a who. It's a... it's a...

788
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:39,875
A what? A thing.

789
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:41,176
What thing?

790
00:34:41,178 --> 00:34:42,511
Can you be a little more specific?

791
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:44,580
My ancestor killed himself in an effort

792
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,181
to erase my very existence.

793
00:34:46,183 --> 00:34:48,584
Well, you look pretty spry despite it.

794
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:50,619
The Flash pulled me from the timeline.

795
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:53,589
He held me captive for months
and when I finally got loose,

796
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:57,793
I found myself... pursued by something.

797
00:34:57,795 --> 00:34:59,695
I-I thought it was a time wraith,

798
00:34:59,697 --> 00:35:02,931
the monsters that hunt
speedsters who mess with time.

799
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:06,735
But, whatever is hunting me is...

800
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:11,507
far worse than a time wraith.

801
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:16,345
It can sense the Speed Force.

802
00:35:16,347 --> 00:35:18,180
And it's trying to kill me.

803
00:35:18,182 --> 00:35:20,716
Interestin... so that's why
you keep running out on us.

804
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:23,252
Huh. So you're kinda
like a shark who'll die

805
00:35:23,254 --> 00:35:24,720
if you stay in one place.

806
00:35:24,722 --> 00:35:26,021
We are all going to die if you don't...

807
00:35:29,026 --> 00:35:30,426
It's too late.

808
00:35:30,428 --> 00:35:32,828
It's here.

809
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:34,763
Ah, well, the good
news is you two finally

810
00:35:34,765 --> 00:35:36,699
got what you wanted, you managed
to balance our partnership.

811
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:38,033
We're now all equally dead.

812
00:35:38,035 --> 00:35:39,902
Oh, I wouldn't worry about that.

813
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,537
This isn't the first scary speedster

814
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:43,372
that we had to put in his place.

815
00:35:43,374 --> 00:35:45,941
We're gonna get you out
of this bank vault, Eobard.

816
00:35:45,943 --> 00:35:47,476
But on one condition.

817
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:50,679
You stop treating us like lackeys.

818
00:35:50,681 --> 00:35:53,949
You think you can stop that?

819
00:35:53,951 --> 00:35:55,984
Good luck!

820
00:35:55,986 --> 00:35:57,786
Was that a yes?

821
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:00,622
- Yes.
- Great!

822
00:36:00,624 --> 00:36:01,824
Let's go to work.

823
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,258
Right, so, you say this thing

824
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,194
is attracted to the Speed Force?

825
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:07,896
What if you don't use it?

826
00:36:07,898 --> 00:36:09,331
What are you suggesting?

827
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,133
That you stop running.

828
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,320
It knows I'm here.

829
00:36:28,345 --> 00:36:29,321
Good.

830
00:36:29,346 --> 00:36:31,186
Because we've only got one shot at this.

831
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:41,029
Remember, as long as you stay still,

832
00:36:41,031 --> 00:36:42,431
he can't sense you.

833
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:08,690
Easy, Eobard.

834
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,138
Easy.

835
00:37:46,802 --> 00:37:48,330
It won't stay trapped for long.

836
00:37:48,332 --> 00:37:49,965
We have to go.

837
00:37:49,967 --> 00:37:52,868
We?

838
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:54,903
We...

839
00:37:54,905 --> 00:37:56,705
Partners.

840
00:37:56,707 --> 00:37:57,806
Better.

841
00:38:02,695 --> 00:38:05,161
Gideon, can you please take
the ship back to Central City?

842
00:38:05,163 --> 00:38:07,430
If your goal is to return to 2017,

843
00:38:07,432 --> 00:38:09,265
I'm afraid your father has instructed me

844
00:38:09,267 --> 00:38:11,067
not to permit you to leave the ship.

845
00:38:11,069 --> 00:38:13,936
Well, considering he never
wanted to be my father,

846
00:38:13,938 --> 00:38:16,005
that should draw his parental dictates

847
00:38:16,007 --> 00:38:17,473
into question, wouldn't it?

848
00:38:17,475 --> 00:38:19,742
You share my fondness for erudition.

849
00:38:21,112 --> 00:38:24,513
You truly are my daughter.

850
00:38:24,515 --> 00:38:27,783
Well, I am sorry about that.

851
00:38:27,785 --> 00:38:30,653
No, I'm... I'm the one who's sorry.

852
00:38:30,655 --> 00:38:33,289
For what?

853
00:38:33,291 --> 00:38:35,357
It's not your fault I'm a mistake.

854
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:38,961
Uh, I've made many mistakes
in my life, Lily, but you...

855
00:38:38,963 --> 00:38:42,598
most certainly are not one of them.

856
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:45,601
The apology that I owe
you is for not telling you

857
00:38:45,603 --> 00:38:49,238
about the unique circumstances
of your conception.

858
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,640
You didn't want me to
know that you didn't want me.

859
00:38:54,879 --> 00:38:57,913
No, you're right, I...

860
00:38:57,915 --> 00:38:59,548
I didn't want children.

861
00:39:01,652 --> 00:39:04,653
But if there's one thing my travels

862
00:39:04,655 --> 00:39:07,957
aboard the Waverider have taught me,

863
00:39:07,959 --> 00:39:11,594
it's that time often doesn't
provide us with what we want.

864
00:39:11,596 --> 00:39:15,131
But it... it's quite adept
at giving us what we need.

865
00:39:17,435 --> 00:39:20,102
And I... I needed you...

866
00:39:20,104 --> 00:39:21,370
in my life...

867
00:39:23,674 --> 00:39:28,043
In ways that I... I could
never even dare to imagine.

868
00:39:34,118 --> 00:39:38,587
I just don't want there to
be any more secrets between us.

869
00:39:38,589 --> 00:39:42,191
Well, in that spirit, I
suppose I should tell you

870
00:39:42,193 --> 00:39:46,061
that I am one half of a
nuclear powered superhero

871
00:39:46,063 --> 00:39:48,030
called Firestorm.

872
00:39:50,301 --> 00:39:51,934
So not funny, Dad.

873
00:39:55,439 --> 00:39:58,674
Anyway, as fun as this was,

874
00:39:58,676 --> 00:40:02,945
I probably should be getting home.

875
00:40:02,947 --> 00:40:04,747
You're sure you can't stay?

876
00:40:04,749 --> 00:40:06,916
I... I would. I just, um...

877
00:40:06,918 --> 00:40:09,552
I'm working on a series
of synthetic proteins

878
00:40:09,554 --> 00:40:12,454
that are not gonna
fold themselves, so...

879
00:40:12,456 --> 00:40:14,757
So then, I guess this is good-bye.

880
00:40:18,296 --> 00:40:20,462
Good luck folding those proteins.

881
00:40:20,464 --> 00:40:22,138
Good luck rescuing your friend, Rip.

882
00:40:22,163 --> 00:40:23,432
Hm.

883
00:40:29,974 --> 00:40:31,874
Bye, Dad.

884
00:40:48,092 --> 00:40:50,473
Feel no pressure to tell
us what all this techno-crap

885
00:40:50,498 --> 00:40:51,287
is about.

886
00:40:51,312 --> 00:40:52,962
We're sure we can
figure it out ourselves.

887
00:40:52,964 --> 00:40:55,197
This, uh, techno-crap,

888
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:57,666
as you so eloquently put it,

889
00:40:57,668 --> 00:40:59,535
is Captain Hunter's memories.

890
00:40:59,537 --> 00:41:01,670
Including the locations
of the other pieces

891
00:41:01,672 --> 00:41:03,172
of the Spear, I hope.

892
00:41:03,174 --> 00:41:05,107
That is my working assumption, yes.

893
00:41:05,109 --> 00:41:07,209
All we have to do now
is upload his memories

894
00:41:07,211 --> 00:41:09,178
to his cerebral cortex.

895
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:11,580
And that's not happening now because?

896
00:41:11,582 --> 00:41:15,150
Well, we would hardly be doing
Captain Hunter any favors

897
00:41:15,152 --> 00:41:17,720
if we just restored the memories
without taking the liberty

898
00:41:17,722 --> 00:41:19,955
to address some of his shortcomings.

899
00:41:19,957 --> 00:41:22,391
What, like, stopping him biting his nails?

900
00:41:22,393 --> 00:41:26,095
Not exactly.

901
00:41:41,078 --> 00:41:43,412
Can I help you with something, soldier?

902
00:41:43,414 --> 00:41:45,281
No, General Washington, I'm fine.

903
00:41:46,751 --> 00:41:49,985
You, on the other hand...

904
00:41:53,138 --> 00:41:57,763
