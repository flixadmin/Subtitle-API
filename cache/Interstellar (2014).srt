1
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,697
Well my dad was a farmer.

2
00:01:18,162 --> 00:01:20,621
Like everybody else back then.

3
00:01:22,968 --> 00:01:24,577
Of course he didn't start that way.

4
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:32,567
<i>Computer says you are too tight.</i>

5
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,040
<i>No I got this.</i>

6
00:01:34,572 --> 00:01:35,794
<i>Crossing the Straights.</i>

7
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:40,016
<i>Shutting it down Cooper.
No!</i>

8
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,936
<i>Shutting it all down.
No I need power up!</i>

9
00:01:48,228 --> 00:01:49,061
Dad?

10
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:56,771
Sorry Murph.

11
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,476
Go back to bed babe.

12
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:00,066
I thought you were the ghost.

13
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:01,209
No.

14
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:04,924
There are no such things as ghosts babe.

15
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:06,908
Grandpa says you can get ghosts.

16
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:11,782
Well maybe that's because Grandpa
is a little too close to being one himself.

17
00:02:11,961 --> 00:02:12,961
Back to bed.

18
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:15,383
Were you dreaming about the crash?

19
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,946
Get your butt back in bed Murph.

20
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,792
The wheat had died.

21
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:50,798
The blight came and we had to burn it.

22
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,590
And we still had corn.
We had acres of corn.

23
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:55,538
But...

24
00:02:55,562 --> 00:02:57,009
mostly we had dust.

25
00:02:59,499 --> 00:03:02,350
I guess I can't describe it.
It was just constant.

26
00:03:02,411 --> 00:03:05,771
Just that steady blow of dirt.

27
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,469
We wore...

28
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:11,219
little strips of sheet,

29
00:03:11,254 --> 00:03:14,198
but sometimes over our nose and mouth,

30
00:03:14,225 --> 00:03:16,823
so that we would not breathe
so much of it.

31
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:22,055
Well when we set the table
we always set the plate upside-down.

32
00:03:22,211 --> 00:03:24,969
Glasses or cups
whatever it was upside-down.

33
00:03:30,847 --> 00:03:31,866
Shake a leg!

34
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:33,268
Murph get a move on!

35
00:03:33,293 --> 00:03:36,862
Tom 4 o'clock today you and me
in the barn Herbicide Resistance 101.

36
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,229
Check?
Yes sir.

37
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,137
Not at the table Murph.

38
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:43,723
Dad can you fix this?

39
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,922
What the heck did you do to my lander?
Was not me.

40
00:03:48,426 --> 00:03:50,461
Let me guess. It was your ghost?

41
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:51,886
It knocked it off my shelf.

42
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,141
It keeps knocking books off.

43
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:54,649
No such things as ghosts dumb-ass.

44
00:03:54,687 --> 00:03:56,076
Hey.
I looked it up.

45
00:03:56,101 --> 00:03:57,230
It's called a poltergeist.

46
00:03:57,255 --> 00:03:58,389
Dad tell her.

47
00:03:58,414 --> 00:04:00,775
Well it's not very scientific Murph.

48
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,135
You said science was about admitting
what we don't know.

49
00:04:03,262 --> 00:04:05,076
She has got you there.
Hey.

50
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:06,996
Start looking after our stuff.

51
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:09,433
Coop.

52
00:04:12,565 --> 00:04:14,732
Alright Murph you wanna talk science?

53
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,787
Don't just tell me that you are afraid
of some ghost.

54
00:04:17,812 --> 00:04:19,164
No you got to go further.

55
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:22,149
You got to record the facts analyze
get to the how and why...

56
00:04:22,251 --> 00:04:23,923
and present your conclusions.

57
00:04:24,516 --> 00:04:25,399
Deal?

58
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,516
Deal.
Alright.

59
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:32,304
Have a good day at school.
Hold up.

60
00:04:32,777 --> 00:04:35,070
Parent-teacher conferences. Parent.

61
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:36,726
Not grandparent.

62
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:40,889
Slow down Turbo.

63
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:43,771
That's not a dust storm.

64
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:45,911
Nelson is torching his whole crop.

65
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:46,811
Blight?

66
00:04:47,178 --> 00:04:49,443
They are saying
it's the last harvest for okra.

67
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:51,370
Ever.

68
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,058
He should have planted corn
like the rest of us.

69
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:58,988
Now you be nice to that Miss Hanley.
She is single.

70
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:00,649
What's that supposed to mean?

71
00:05:00,894 --> 00:05:04,021
Repopulating the earth start
pulling your weight young man.

72
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:06,575
Why don't you start minding
your own business...

73
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:08,602
old man?

74
00:05:15,497 --> 00:05:16,959
Alright Murph give me second.

75
00:05:20,696 --> 00:05:21,871
Third.

76
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:25,643
Find a gear dumb-ass.
Grind it!

77
00:05:25,668 --> 00:05:26,710
Shut it Tom!

78
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:30,441
What did you do Murph?
She didn't do nothing.

79
00:05:30,716 --> 00:05:33,217
Blew a tire is all.
Murphy's Law.

80
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:34,822
Shut up!

81
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:37,079
Grab the spare Tom.
That is the spare.

82
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:40,798
Get the patch kit!

83
00:05:42,204 --> 00:05:43,914
How am I supposed to patch it out here?

84
00:05:44,134 --> 00:05:45,351
You got to figure it out.

85
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,447
I am not always gonna be here to help you.

86
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:57,764
What's going on Murph?

87
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,803
Why did you and Mom name me
after something that's bad?

88
00:06:01,374 --> 00:06:02,421
No we didn't.

89
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,257
Murphy's Law?

90
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:08,523
Murphy's Law doesn't mean
that something bad...

91
00:06:09,304 --> 00:06:11,734
will happen. What it means
is whatever can happen...

92
00:06:12,601 --> 00:06:13,491
will happen.

93
00:06:13,558 --> 00:06:15,418
And that sounded just fine with us.

94
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,324
Get in.

95
00:06:25,103 --> 00:06:26,259
Get in, let's go.

96
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:29,802
What about the flat tire?

97
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:33,985
Yeah.

98
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:49,814
It's an Indian Air Force drone.

99
00:06:49,838 --> 00:06:52,161
Solar cells could power an entire farm.

100
00:06:52,186 --> 00:06:53,550
Take the wheel Tom.

101
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,586
Go, go, go!

102
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:03,758
Keep that aimed right at it.

103
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:14,083
Faster Tom. I am losing it.

104
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:15,893
Right at it.

105
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:18,895
Stay on it.

106
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,329
Here we go.

107
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:31,631
Nice one Tom.

108
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,433
Dad?

109
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,562
I almost got it. Don't stop. Don't stop!

110
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,222
Dad!

111
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:45,628
Tom!

112
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:52,478
You told me to keep driving.

113
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:57,785
Well I guess that answers the old
if I asked you to drive off a cliff scenario.

114
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:02,345
We lost it.

115
00:08:02,369 --> 00:08:04,233
No we didn't.

116
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,301
Want to give it a whirl?

117
00:08:24,588 --> 00:08:25,611
This way.

118
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,322
Go.

119
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:36,432
Let's lay her down right there
at the edge of the reservoir.

120
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:41,744
Nicely done.

121
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,080
How long you think it's been up there?

122
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:50,029
Delhi Mission Control went down
same as ours

123
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:51,368
ten years ago.

124
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,017
So for ten years?

125
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,651
Why did it come down so low?

126
00:08:58,675 --> 00:08:59,690
I don't know.

127
00:09:00,141 --> 00:09:03,059
Maybe the sun cooked its brain
or it was looking for something.

128
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:03,865
What?

129
00:09:04,045 --> 00:09:05,354
Give me a large flat blade.

130
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,326
Maybe some kind of signal?

131
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,685
I don't know.

132
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,221
What are you gonna do with it?

133
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:19,012
I am gonna give it something
socially responsible to do...

134
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:21,684
like drive a combine.

135
00:09:22,204 --> 00:09:23,705
Can't we just let it go?

136
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,366
It was not hurting anybody.

137
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,330
This thing needs to learn
how to adapt Murph...

138
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,338
like the rest of us.

139
00:09:38,251 --> 00:09:39,971
So How does this work?
You guys come with?

140
00:09:40,183 --> 00:09:41,225
I have got class.

141
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:42,380
This one...

142
00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:43,759
needs to wait.

143
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:46,377
What did you do?

144
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:48,307
They will tell you about it
when you get in there.

145
00:09:48,332 --> 00:09:50,500
Am I not gonna be mad?
Not with me.

146
00:09:50,525 --> 00:09:52,341
Just please try not to.
Hey.

147
00:09:52,365 --> 00:09:53,437
Relax.

148
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:56,345
I got this.

149
00:10:00,971 --> 00:10:02,142
Little late Coop.

150
00:10:02,403 --> 00:10:03,846
Yeah we had a flat.

151
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,564
And I guess you had to stop
off at the Asian fighter plane store.

152
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,514
No actually sir that's a...

153
00:10:09,538 --> 00:10:11,443
That's a surveillance drone.

154
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,970
With outstanding solar cells.
It's Indian.

155
00:10:14,671 --> 00:10:15,829
Take a seat.

156
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:18,243
So...

157
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,405
we got Tom's scores back.

158
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,540
He is going to make an excellent farmer.

159
00:10:24,702 --> 00:10:26,489
Yeah he has got a knack for it.

160
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:27,928
What about college?

161
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:32,159
Well the... university only takes a handful.
They don't really have the resources to...

162
00:10:32,184 --> 00:10:33,807
I still pay my taxes.

163
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,128
Where is that money go?
There is no more armies.

164
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:39,129
Well it doesn't go to the university.

165
00:10:40,499 --> 00:10:41,981
Look Coop you have to be realistic.

166
00:10:42,006 --> 00:10:44,325
You are ruling my son out for college now?

167
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:46,438
The kid is 15.

168
00:10:46,462 --> 00:10:48,814
Tom's score simply isn't high enough.

169
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,013
What's your waistline?

170
00:10:51,037 --> 00:10:52,308
About what 32?

171
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:53,975
About a 33 inseam?

172
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,070
I am not sure I see
what you are getting at.

173
00:10:56,071 --> 00:10:58,551
You are telling me it takes two numbers
to measure your own ass

174
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:00,594
but only one to measure my son's future?

175
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:02,441
Come on.

176
00:11:02,794 --> 00:11:04,591
You are a well-educated man, Coop.

177
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:06,656
And a trained pilot.
And an engineer.

178
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:08,781
Ok well right now,

179
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:11,338
we don't need more engineers.

180
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:15,079
We didn't run out of television screens
and planes.

181
00:11:15,103 --> 00:11:16,670
We ran out of food.

182
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,499
The world needs farmers.

183
00:11:18,877 --> 00:11:20,346
Good farmers like you.

184
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,578
And Tom.
Uneducated farmers.

185
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,840
We are a caretaker generation Coop.

186
00:11:26,301 --> 00:11:27,728
And things are getting better.

187
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:30,660
Maybe your grandkids will get to be engin...
We done here sir?

188
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:33,176
No.

189
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,317
Miss Hanley is here to talk about Murph.

190
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:38,644
Murph is a great kid.

191
00:11:38,668 --> 00:11:39,469
She is really bright.

192
00:11:39,495 --> 00:11:41,202
But she has been having
a little trouble lately.

193
00:11:41,227 --> 00:11:42,030
She...

194
00:11:42,054 --> 00:11:43,649
brought this in to show the students.

195
00:11:43,673 --> 00:11:45,330
The section on the lunar landings.

196
00:11:45,355 --> 00:11:47,565
Yeah it's one of my old textbooks.

197
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,461
She always loved the pictures.

198
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,827
It's an old federal textbook.

199
00:11:51,851 --> 00:11:53,878
We have replaced them
with the corrected versions.

200
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:55,464
Corrected?

201
00:11:55,772 --> 00:11:59,381
Explaining how the Apollo missions were
faked to bankrupt the Soviet Union.

202
00:12:06,717 --> 00:12:08,676
You don't believe we went to the moon?

203
00:12:09,638 --> 00:12:11,761
I believe it was a brilliant piece
of propaganda.

204
00:12:11,786 --> 00:12:13,638
That the Soviets bankrupted themselves,

205
00:12:13,662 --> 00:12:16,871
pouring resources into rockets
and other useless machines.

206
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,237
Useless machines.

207
00:12:18,459 --> 00:12:22,545
And if we don't want a repeat of the excess
and wastefulness of the 20th century then...

208
00:12:22,752 --> 00:12:24,523
we need to teach our kids
about this planet,

209
00:12:24,718 --> 00:12:26,194
not tales of leaving it.

210
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:30,766
You know one of those useless machines
they used to make was called an MRI.

211
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:33,617
And if we had any of those left,

212
00:12:33,642 --> 00:12:36,789
the doctors would have been able to find
the cyst in my wife's brain,

213
00:12:36,829 --> 00:12:39,029
before she died instead of afterwards.

214
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,841
Then she would have been the one
sitting here listening to this,

215
00:12:41,866 --> 00:12:45,115
instead of me which would have been
a good thing because she was always...

216
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,247
the calmer one.

217
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,956
I am sorry about your wife Mr. Cooper.

218
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:52,134
But...

219
00:12:52,401 --> 00:12:55,333
Murph got into a fistfight with several
of her classmates over this...

220
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,854
Apollo nonsense.

221
00:12:57,464 --> 00:13:00,336
So we thought it would be best to bring you
in and see what ideas you might have

222
00:13:00,361 --> 00:13:02,242
for dealing with her
behavior on the home front.

223
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,064
Yeah you know what...

224
00:13:05,231 --> 00:13:06,886
There is a game, tomorrow night.

225
00:13:07,109 --> 00:13:09,360
She is going through a bit
of a baseball phase.

226
00:13:09,385 --> 00:13:12,915
Her favorite team is playing.
There is gonna be candy and soda and...

227
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,290
I think I will take her to that.

228
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:24,744
How did it go?

229
00:13:26,058 --> 00:13:27,603
I got you suspended.

230
00:13:28,203 --> 00:13:29,537
What?
<i>Cooper.</i>

231
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,394
This is Cooper. Go.

232
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:35,305
<i>Coop those combines
you rebuilt went haywire.</i>

233
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:37,457
Just reset the controllers.

234
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,694
<i>I did that.
Now you should come take a look.</i>

235
00:14:00,566 --> 00:14:03,286
One by one they ave been peeling
off the fields and heading over.

236
00:14:03,687 --> 00:14:05,521
Something is interfering with the compass.

237
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,906
Magnetism or some such.

238
00:14:52,568 --> 00:14:54,435
Nothing special about which book.

239
00:14:54,638 --> 00:14:56,789
I have been working on it, like you said.

240
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:58,803
I counted the spaces.

241
00:14:59,100 --> 00:14:59,943
Why?

242
00:15:02,187 --> 00:15:03,758
In case the ghost
is trying to communicate.

243
00:15:05,144 --> 00:15:06,360
I am trying Morse.

244
00:15:07,177 --> 00:15:08,156
Morse?

245
00:15:08,809 --> 00:15:09,547
Yeah.

246
00:15:10,344 --> 00:15:13,244
Dots and dashes used...
I know what Morse code is, Murph.

247
00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:15,736
I just don't think your bookshelf
is trying to talk to you.

248
00:15:27,587 --> 00:15:29,424
Had to reset every compass clock

249
00:15:29,449 --> 00:15:31,815
and GPS to offset for the anomaly.

250
00:15:32,376 --> 00:15:33,254
Which is?

251
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:34,579
I don't know.

252
00:15:36,782 --> 00:15:38,985
Maybe the house was built
on magnetic ore,

253
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:41,444
we would have seen this the first time
we switched on the tractor.

254
00:15:44,647 --> 00:15:47,359
I hear your meeting at the school
didn't go so well.

255
00:15:49,443 --> 00:15:50,430
You heard?

256
00:15:51,111 --> 00:15:53,500
It's like we have forgotten
who we are Donald.

257
00:15:55,686 --> 00:15:58,818
Explorers, pioneers, not caretakers.

258
00:16:01,013 --> 00:16:02,333
When I was a kid...

259
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:05,369
it felt like they made something
new every day.

260
00:16:05,612 --> 00:16:06,591
Some...

261
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,789
gadget or idea.

262
00:16:09,031 --> 00:16:10,643
Like every day was Christmas.

263
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:11,792
But six...

264
00:16:12,081 --> 00:16:13,526
billion people...

265
00:16:13,991 --> 00:16:15,471
just try to imagine that.

266
00:16:16,963 --> 00:16:19,579
And every last one of them
trying to have it all.

267
00:16:23,359 --> 00:16:24,930
This world isn't so bad.

268
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:29,232
And Tom will do just fine.

269
00:16:29,548 --> 00:16:31,270
You are the one who doesn't belong.

270
00:16:31,403 --> 00:16:34,412
Born 40 years too late
or 40 years too early.

271
00:16:35,374 --> 00:16:37,428
My daughter knew it, God bless her.

272
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:39,862
And your kids know it.

273
00:16:39,886 --> 00:16:41,120
Especially Murph.

274
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:44,698
Well we used to look
up in the sky and wonder...

275
00:16:45,444 --> 00:16:47,238
at our place in the stars.

276
00:16:50,179 --> 00:16:51,707
Now we just look down...

277
00:16:52,258 --> 00:16:54,633
and worry about our place in the dirt.

278
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:55,711
Cooper,

279
00:16:55,993 --> 00:16:57,415
you were good at something...

280
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:00,639
and you never got a chance
to do anything with it.

281
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:02,647
I am sorry.

282
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:06,526
You didn't expect this dirt,

283
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:08,734
that was giving you this food...

284
00:17:09,038 --> 00:17:12,123
to turn on you like that and destroy you.

285
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:14,521
In April I believe I am right...

286
00:17:14,888 --> 00:17:17,035
Fifteenth of April I think.

287
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:19,574
This happened about 1:30
when that thing

288
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,598
came off the top of that canyon.

289
00:17:23,341 --> 00:17:25,467
In my day we had real ballplayers.

290
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,043
Who are these bums?

291
00:17:27,957 --> 00:17:29,932
Well in my day people were too busy

292
00:17:29,957 --> 00:17:32,200
fighting over food to even play baseball.

293
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:34,959
Popcorn at a ballgame is unnatural.

294
00:17:36,111 --> 00:17:37,345
I want a hot dog.

295
00:17:37,533 --> 00:17:39,447
School says you are gonna
follow in my footsteps.

296
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:41,822
I think that's great.

297
00:17:42,469 --> 00:17:43,676
You think that's great?

298
00:17:43,895 --> 00:17:45,438
You hate farming Dad.

299
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:47,485
Grandpa said.

300
00:17:48,155 --> 00:17:49,399
Grandpa said?

301
00:17:50,212 --> 00:17:52,370
Listen all that matters
is how you feel about it.

302
00:17:52,904 --> 00:17:54,206
I like what you do.

303
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:56,386
I like our farm.

304
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:58,761
You are gonna be great at it.

305
00:18:12,134 --> 00:18:13,252
Let's get out of here.

306
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:22,418
Alright it's a doozy.

307
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:24,957
Alright gang let's mask up.

308
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,596
Tom? Murph?

309
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,628
Yeah.
Check?

310
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,378
Murph, Tom, you guys,
shut your windows?

311
00:19:30,894 --> 00:19:31,696
Murph?

312
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:54,479
The ghost.

313
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,136
Grab your pillow.

314
00:19:58,298 --> 00:19:59,571
You sleep in with Tom.

315
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,241
It's not a ghost.

316
00:21:02,131 --> 00:21:03,192
It's gravity.

317
00:21:05,589 --> 00:21:07,661
I am dropping Tom then heading to town.

318
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:09,256
You want to clean that up,

319
00:21:10,418 --> 00:21:12,127
when you have finished praying to it?

320
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:40,023
It's not Morse Murph. It's binary.

321
00:21:40,494 --> 00:21:42,892
Thick is one, thin is zero.

322
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:47,907
Coordinates.

323
00:21:50,869 --> 00:21:51,705
Nope.

324
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:55,772
Here we go.

325
00:21:57,358 --> 00:21:58,572
Thirty-three.

326
00:22:01,896 --> 00:22:02,749
That's it.

327
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:05,699
I can't miss this!

328
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:08,757
Grandpa will be back
in a couple hours Murph.

329
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:12,113
But you don't know what you are gonna find.

330
00:22:13,681 --> 00:22:14,715
And that...

331
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:17,801
is why I can't take you.

332
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,181
Murph?

333
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:30,478
Grandpa will be home in a while.
Tell him I will call him on the radio.

334
00:22:37,548 --> 00:22:38,463
Jesus.

335
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,564
What are you doing?

336
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:43,111
Oh you think this is funny?

337
00:22:43,993 --> 00:22:45,921
You would not be here,
if it was not for me.

338
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:49,905
Make yourself useful.

339
00:23:53,575 --> 00:23:54,508
Murph?

340
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:57,138
Murph!

341
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:02,802
I think this is the end of the road.

342
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,178
Didn't you bring the bolt cutters?

343
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:10,881
That's my girl.

344
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:40,073
Step away from the fence!
No! No! No!

345
00:24:40,098 --> 00:24:41,926
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
I am not armed.

346
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,347
My daughter is in the car.

347
00:24:48,971 --> 00:24:50,244
Don't be afraid.

348
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:05,099
How did you find this place?

349
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:07,797
Where is my daughter?

350
00:25:08,099 --> 00:25:10,790
You had the coordinates for this facility
marked on your map.

351
00:25:10,815 --> 00:25:12,051
Where did you get those coordinates?

352
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:13,456
Where is my daughter?

353
00:25:13,481 --> 00:25:16,065
Don't make me take you down again.
Sit down!

354
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,110
Oh you still think you are a Marine pal?

355
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:21,392
Marines don't exist anymore.

356
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:25,264
And I got grunts like you mowing my grass.

357
00:25:25,564 --> 00:25:27,168
Where did you find those coordinates?

358
00:25:27,248 --> 00:25:29,363
But you don't look much like a lawnmower.

359
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:32,910
Think I will turn you into
an overqualified vacuum cleaner.

360
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:33,988
No you won't.

361
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:36,606
TARS,

362
00:25:36,895 --> 00:25:37,967
back down please.

363
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:40,652
You know you are taking a risk,

364
00:25:40,676 --> 00:25:42,666
using ex-military security.

365
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:45,115
They are old and their control units are...

366
00:25:45,749 --> 00:25:46,770
unpredictable.

367
00:25:47,005 --> 00:25:48,723
It's what the government could spare.

368
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:51,478
Who are you?

369
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,003
Dr. Brand.

370
00:25:53,746 --> 00:25:56,322
I knew a Dr. Brand once.
He was a professor.

371
00:25:56,542 --> 00:25:58,042
What makes you think I am not?

372
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:00,206
Was not near as cute either.

373
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,340
Please Dr. Brand.

374
00:26:02,364 --> 00:26:03,785
I don't have any idea what this is.

375
00:26:04,457 --> 00:26:07,028
Now I am scared for my daughter
and want her by my side.

376
00:26:07,075 --> 00:26:09,535
You give me that I will tell you
anything you want to know.

377
00:26:13,032 --> 00:26:15,464
Get the principals and the girl
in the conference room please.

378
00:26:17,369 --> 00:26:18,683
Your daughter is fine.

379
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,262
Bright kid.

380
00:26:20,691 --> 00:26:22,425
Must have a very smart mother.

381
00:26:22,536 --> 00:26:25,133
It's pretty clear you
don't want any visitors.

382
00:26:25,217 --> 00:26:27,282
So why don't you just let us back up
from your fence

383
00:26:27,306 --> 00:26:29,137
and we will be on our way?

384
00:26:29,572 --> 00:26:30,952
It's not that simple.
Well...

385
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,165
sure it is.

386
00:26:32,388 --> 00:26:35,540
I don't know anything about you.
I don't know anything about this place.

387
00:26:36,832 --> 00:26:37,861
Yes you do.

388
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:44,523
Dad!

389
00:26:47,687 --> 00:26:48,728
Hello Cooper.

390
00:26:50,158 --> 00:26:51,200
Professor Brand.

391
00:26:52,737 --> 00:26:54,896
Explain to me how you found this facility.

392
00:26:55,426 --> 00:26:56,561
Kind of an accident.

393
00:26:56,585 --> 00:26:57,521
We sort of stumbled upon it.

394
00:26:57,545 --> 00:26:58,720
We were on a salvage run...

395
00:26:58,745 --> 00:27:01,317
You are sitting in the best-kept
secret in the world.

396
00:27:01,704 --> 00:27:03,109
Nobody stumbles in here.

397
00:27:03,171 --> 00:27:04,888
Nobody stumbles out.

398
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:06,279
Cooper,

399
00:27:06,623 --> 00:27:07,388
please.

400
00:27:07,668 --> 00:27:09,333
Cooperate with these people.

401
00:27:09,802 --> 00:27:10,599
Look.

402
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:13,575
It's kind of hard to explain.

403
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:16,206
Now we learned these...

404
00:27:16,534 --> 00:27:17,499
coordinates,

405
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:18,816
from an anomaly.

406
00:27:19,112 --> 00:27:20,248
What sort of anomaly?

407
00:27:20,308 --> 00:27:22,420
I hesitate to term it supernatural,

408
00:27:22,444 --> 00:27:23,881
but it definitely was not scientific.

409
00:27:23,906 --> 00:27:26,814
You are going to have to be specific
Mr. Cooper.

410
00:27:26,866 --> 00:27:27,854
Right now.

411
00:27:28,022 --> 00:27:29,170
It was gravity.

412
00:27:34,294 --> 00:27:37,169
What sort of gravitational anomaly?
Where was this?

413
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:40,520
Now I am real happy that you are
excited about gravity bud but..

414
00:27:41,083 --> 00:27:43,674
You are not getting any answers
from us until I get assurances.

415
00:27:43,751 --> 00:27:45,385
Assurances?
Yeah.

416
00:27:46,422 --> 00:27:47,821
Like that we are getting out of here.

417
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,041
And I don't mean in the trunk of some car.

418
00:27:52,327 --> 00:27:54,226
Don't you know who we are Coop?

419
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,840
No professor, I don't.

420
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:57,835
You know my father Professor Brand.

421
00:27:58,635 --> 00:27:59,788
We are NASA.

422
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:02,544
NASA?

423
00:28:02,796 --> 00:28:03,663
NASA.

424
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:06,059
The same NASA, you flew for.

425
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:18,922
I heard they shut you down sir.

426
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:20,604
For refusing to drop bombs,

427
00:28:20,628 --> 00:28:22,829
from the stratosphere onto starving people.

428
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:27,197
When they realized that killing other
people was not a long-term solution

429
00:28:27,345 --> 00:28:29,487
then they needed us back.
In secret.

430
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:30,719
Why secret?

431
00:28:30,793 --> 00:28:34,629
Because public opinion would not
allow spending on space exploration.

432
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:37,256
Not while you are struggling
to put food on the table.

433
00:28:38,801 --> 00:28:39,640
Blight.

434
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:41,041
Wheat,

435
00:28:41,236 --> 00:28:42,417
seven years ago.

436
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:44,263
Okra, this year.

437
00:28:45,015 --> 00:28:46,457
Now there is just corn.

438
00:28:47,126 --> 00:28:49,085
And we are growing more
than we ever have.

439
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:53,027
But like the potatoes in Ireland
and the wheat in the Dust Bowl...

440
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:54,763
the corn...

441
00:28:55,195 --> 00:28:56,401
will die.

442
00:28:57,261 --> 00:28:58,109
Soon.

443
00:29:03,671 --> 00:29:06,791
We will find a way professor.
We always have.

444
00:29:07,994 --> 00:29:10,028
Driven by the unshakable faith,

445
00:29:10,052 --> 00:29:11,604
the Earth is ours.

446
00:29:12,412 --> 00:29:14,036
Not just ours, no.

447
00:29:15,104 --> 00:29:16,505
But it is our home.

448
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:19,037
Earth's atmosphere,

449
00:29:19,208 --> 00:29:20,288
is 80 percent...

450
00:29:20,629 --> 00:29:22,885
nitrogen. We don't even breathe nitrogen.

451
00:29:23,196 --> 00:29:24,125
Blight does.

452
00:29:24,149 --> 00:29:25,543
And as it thrives,

453
00:29:25,668 --> 00:29:28,059
our air gets less and less oxygen.

454
00:29:28,738 --> 00:29:31,871
The last people to starve
will be the first to suffocate.

455
00:29:32,382 --> 00:29:34,074
And your daughter's generation...

456
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:37,976
will be the last to survive on Earth.

457
00:29:38,545 --> 00:29:40,262
Murph is feeling a little tired.

458
00:29:40,286 --> 00:29:42,281
I was wondering
if she could take a nap in my office.

459
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:43,922
Yeah. Thank you.

460
00:29:46,827 --> 00:29:47,640
Ok...

461
00:29:48,871 --> 00:29:50,110
now you need to tell me,

462
00:29:50,134 --> 00:29:52,050
what your plan is to save the world.

463
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,073
We are not meant, to save the world.

464
00:29:55,643 --> 00:29:57,091
We are meant to leave it.

465
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:03,426
Rangers.

466
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:06,751
The last components of our
one versatile ship,

467
00:30:06,844 --> 00:30:08,681
in orbit the Endurance.

468
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:10,600
Our final expedition.

469
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:12,382
You sent...

470
00:30:12,971 --> 00:30:14,760
people out there
looking for a new home?

471
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,272
The Lazarus missions.

472
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:17,929
Oh that sounds cheerful.

473
00:30:17,953 --> 00:30:19,691
Lazarus came back from the dead.

474
00:30:19,902 --> 00:30:22,269
Sure but he had to die in the first place.

475
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:25,627
There is not a planet in our solar system
that could sustain life,

476
00:30:25,652 --> 00:30:28,105
and the nearest star
is over a thousand years away

477
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:30,465
and that doesn't even qualify as futile.

478
00:30:32,593 --> 00:30:33,754
Where did you send them?

479
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:35,059
Cooper...

480
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:37,365
I can't tell you anymore,

481
00:30:37,532 --> 00:30:40,043
unless you agree to pilot this craft.

482
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:42,537
You are the best pilot we ever had.

483
00:30:42,561 --> 00:30:44,165
I barely left the stratosphere.

484
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:46,517
This team never left the simulator.

485
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:47,792
We need a pilot,

486
00:30:47,816 --> 00:30:50,400
and this is the mission
that you were trained for.

487
00:30:50,872 --> 00:30:52,373
Without even knowing it?

488
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:55,573
An hour ago,
you didn't even know I was alive.

489
00:30:55,597 --> 00:30:57,362
I mean, you-you-you were going anyway.

490
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,089
We had no choice.

491
00:30:59,823 --> 00:31:01,448
But something sent you here.

492
00:31:01,652 --> 00:31:02,724
They chose you.

493
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:04,214
Who is they?

494
00:31:12,415 --> 00:31:13,318
How long...

495
00:31:13,717 --> 00:31:14,707
would I be gone?

496
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:15,737
Hard to know.

497
00:31:16,673 --> 00:31:17,595
Years?

498
00:31:18,538 --> 00:31:19,993
I have got kids professor.

499
00:31:20,758 --> 00:31:22,947
Get out there and save them.

500
00:31:26,314 --> 00:31:27,290
Who is they?

501
00:31:27,748 --> 00:31:31,542
We started detecting gravitational
anomalies almost 50 years ago.

502
00:31:31,825 --> 00:31:35,180
Mostly small distortions to our instruments
in the upper atmosphere.

503
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:38,604
In fact, I believe you
encountered one yourself.

504
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:40,925
Yeah over the Straights.

505
00:31:42,276 --> 00:31:43,807
My crash. Something...

506
00:31:44,018 --> 00:31:45,362
tripped my fly-by-wire.

507
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:46,354
Exactly.

508
00:31:47,674 --> 00:31:49,144
But of all these anomalies,

509
00:31:50,112 --> 00:31:52,292
the most significant, is this.

510
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:53,948
Out near Saturn...

511
00:31:54,866 --> 00:31:56,450
a disturbance of space-time.

512
00:31:59,001 --> 00:32:00,073
Is that a wormhole?

513
00:32:00,451 --> 00:32:01,959
It appeared 48 years ago.

514
00:32:02,588 --> 00:32:04,865
And it leads where?

515
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:06,326
Another galaxy.

516
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:10,678
A wormhole is not a naturally
occurring phenomenon.

517
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:12,263
Someone placed it there.

518
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:13,779
They?

519
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,381
And whoever they are...

520
00:32:16,995 --> 00:32:18,800
they appear to be looking out for us.

521
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:20,760
That wormhole,

522
00:32:20,784 --> 00:32:22,393
lets us travel to other stars.

523
00:32:22,659 --> 00:32:24,323
It came along right as we needed it.

524
00:32:24,396 --> 00:32:27,314
They ave put potentially habitable
worlds right within our reach.

525
00:32:27,638 --> 00:32:29,556
Twelve in fact from our initial probes.

526
00:32:29,872 --> 00:32:31,364
You sent probes into that?

527
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:33,606
We sent people into it.

528
00:32:34,341 --> 00:32:35,403
Ten years ago.

529
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:37,856
The Lazarus missions.

530
00:32:38,599 --> 00:32:39,975
Twelve possible worlds...

531
00:32:40,008 --> 00:32:41,531
twelve Ranger launches.

532
00:32:41,857 --> 00:32:42,644
Carrying...

533
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:44,075
the bravest humans,

534
00:32:44,099 --> 00:32:45,161
ever to live.

535
00:32:45,255 --> 00:32:47,882
Led by the remarkable Dr. Mann.

536
00:32:48,249 --> 00:32:51,465
Each person's landing pod had
enough life support for two years.

537
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:54,127
But they could use hibernation
to stretch that making...

538
00:32:54,346 --> 00:32:56,952
observations on organics
over a decade or more.

539
00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:59,174
Their mission was to assess their world

540
00:32:59,322 --> 00:33:00,670
and if it showed potential...

541
00:33:01,307 --> 00:33:03,887
then they could send out a signal bed
down for the long nap,

542
00:33:04,461 --> 00:33:05,728
wait to be rescued.

543
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,765
And what if the world didn't show promise?

544
00:33:08,791 --> 00:33:09,836
Hence the bravery.

545
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:13,240
You don't have the resources
to visit all 12.

546
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:14,231
No.

547
00:33:15,614 --> 00:33:18,278
Data transmission back
through the wormhole is rudimentary.

548
00:33:18,372 --> 00:33:20,570
Simple binary pings on an annual basis

549
00:33:20,594 --> 00:33:23,372
give us some clue as to which worlds
have potential.

550
00:33:23,894 --> 00:33:25,575
And one system shows promise.

551
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:27,930
And one, that's a bit of a long shot, isn't it?

552
00:33:29,091 --> 00:33:31,881
One system with three potential worlds?

553
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:33,453
A long shot?

554
00:33:36,098 --> 00:33:37,070
Ok.

555
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:39,633
So if we find a home...

556
00:33:43,109 --> 00:33:43,968
then what?

557
00:33:44,236 --> 00:33:46,080
That's the long shot.

558
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:47,805
There is a Plan A,

559
00:33:48,385 --> 00:33:49,588
and a Plan B.

560
00:33:50,609 --> 00:33:53,694
Did you notice anything strange
about the launch chamber?

561
00:34:05,127 --> 00:34:08,045
This entire facility is a centrifuge.

562
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,702
Some kind of vehicle.

563
00:34:10,153 --> 00:34:11,098
A space station?

564
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:11,913
Both.

565
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:12,973
Plan A.

566
00:34:13,135 --> 00:34:14,681
How do you get it off the ground?

567
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:16,806
The first gravitational,

568
00:34:17,109 --> 00:34:19,119
anomalies changed everything.

569
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:20,630
Suddenly we knew,

570
00:34:20,841 --> 00:34:22,298
that harnessing gravity,

571
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:23,447
was real.

572
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,530
So, I started working on a theory and...

573
00:34:26,804 --> 00:34:28,733
we started building this station.

574
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:30,874
But you have not solved it yet.

575
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:33,708
That's why there is Plan B.

576
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,145
The problem is gravity.

577
00:34:36,169 --> 00:34:39,107
How to get a viable amount
of human life off the planet.

578
00:34:39,436 --> 00:34:40,529
This is one way.

579
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:41,651
Plan B.

580
00:34:41,752 --> 00:34:43,063
A population bomb.

581
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:45,613
Over 5000 fertilized eggs,

582
00:34:45,985 --> 00:34:47,961
weighing in at just under 900 kilos.

583
00:34:49,272 --> 00:34:50,549
Well how would you raise them?

584
00:34:50,656 --> 00:34:53,346
With equipment on board
we incubate the first 10.

585
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:55,671
After that, with surrogacy,

586
00:34:55,695 --> 00:34:57,303
the growth becomes exponential.

587
00:34:58,156 --> 00:35:01,026
Within 30 years we could have
a colony of hundreds.

588
00:35:01,647 --> 00:35:05,024
The real difficulty with colonization
is genetic diversity.

589
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:06,731
This takes care of that.

590
00:35:07,267 --> 00:35:09,489
But what about the people here?
You just...

591
00:35:10,173 --> 00:35:11,506
you give up on them?

592
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:12,966
My kids?

593
00:35:13,872 --> 00:35:15,476
That's why Plan A.

594
00:35:15,602 --> 00:35:16,963
Is a lot more fun.

595
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:20,815
How far have you got?

596
00:35:21,078 --> 00:35:22,244
Almost there.

597
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:24,516
You are asking me to hang everything...

598
00:35:26,116 --> 00:35:27,381
on an almost?

599
00:35:27,751 --> 00:35:29,803
I am asking you, to trust me.

600
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:34,626
Find us a new home.

601
00:35:35,651 --> 00:35:37,152
And by the time you return...

602
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,584
I will have solved the problem,

603
00:35:39,608 --> 00:35:40,607
of gravity.

604
00:35:41,897 --> 00:35:43,271
I give you my word.

605
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,073
Go away!

606
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,064
Murph.

607
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:10,198
Go!

608
00:36:10,589 --> 00:36:12,283
If you are leaving just go.

609
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,749
This world was never enough for you,
was it Coop?

610
00:36:19,052 --> 00:36:22,405
What, because heading out there
is what I feel like I was born to do?

611
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:25,237
And it excites me?

612
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:28,565
No that does not make it wrong.

613
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:29,862
It might.

614
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:33,151
Don't trust the right thing
done for the wrong reason.

615
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,652
The why of the thing
that's the foundation.

616
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,595
And the foundation is solid.

617
00:36:42,075 --> 00:36:46,522
We farmers we sit here every year
when the rains fail and we say.

618
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:48,350
Next year.

619
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:52,514
Well next year ain't gonna
save us nor the one after that.

620
00:36:53,595 --> 00:36:57,558
This world is a treasure Donald but
it's been telling us to leave for a while now.

621
00:37:02,496 --> 00:37:06,035
Mankind was born on Earth
it was never meant to die here.

622
00:37:09,782 --> 00:37:12,696
Tom will be alright but you got
to make things right with Murph.

623
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:13,837
I will.

624
00:37:15,081 --> 00:37:17,650
Without making promises you
don't know you can keep.

625
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:30,358
You have to talk to me Murph.

626
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,377
I need to fix this before I go.

627
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:37,889
Then I will keep it
broken so you have to stay.

628
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:45,012
After you kids came along your mom she said
something to me I never quite understood.

629
00:37:45,403 --> 00:37:46,679
She said now...

630
00:37:48,892 --> 00:37:50,214
We are just here...

631
00:37:51,167 --> 00:37:53,056
to be memories for our kids.

632
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:00,835
And I think that now
I understand what she meant.

633
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:08,033
Once you are a parent you are
the ghost of your children's future.

634
00:38:10,279 --> 00:38:11,887
You said ghosts didn't exist.

635
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:20,012
That's right Murph.

636
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:24,729
Murph look at me.

637
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:30,034
I can't be your ghost right now.

638
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:33,679
I need to exist.

639
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:37,398
They chose me.

640
00:38:38,526 --> 00:38:39,848
Murph they chose me.

641
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:42,129
You saw.
You are the one who led me to them.

642
00:38:45,179 --> 00:38:47,176
That's exactly why you can't go.

643
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:52,304
I figured out the message.

644
00:38:53,123 --> 00:38:54,111
One word.

645
00:38:54,366 --> 00:38:55,488
Know what it is?

646
00:38:55,857 --> 00:38:56,476
Murph.

647
00:38:56,850 --> 00:38:57,616
Stay.

648
00:38:58,211 --> 00:38:59,158
It says...

649
00:38:59,518 --> 00:39:01,156
Stay Dad.
Murph.

650
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,507
You don't believe me.

651
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:04,747
Look at the books!

652
00:39:04,771 --> 00:39:06,468
Look at this. It says, Stay.

653
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:08,626
Why you are not listening!

654
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:09,815
It says, Stay!

655
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:11,401
No, I am coming back.

656
00:39:12,096 --> 00:39:13,151
When?

657
00:39:26,468 --> 00:39:27,478
One for you,

658
00:39:27,851 --> 00:39:28,968
one for me.

659
00:39:29,234 --> 00:39:31,335
When I am up there in hypersleep,

660
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,358
or...

661
00:39:32,921 --> 00:39:34,960
or traveling near the speed of light

662
00:39:35,225 --> 00:39:35,861
or...

663
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:37,865
near a black hole...

664
00:39:38,853 --> 00:39:40,616
time is gonna to change for me.

665
00:39:41,459 --> 00:39:43,048
And it's going to run more slowly.

666
00:39:43,502 --> 00:39:44,221
Now...

667
00:39:45,242 --> 00:39:46,587
when I get back...

668
00:39:48,384 --> 00:39:49,548
we are going to compare.

669
00:39:49,707 --> 00:39:51,814
Time will run differently for us?
Yeah.

670
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:56,317
By the time I get back we might
even be the same age,

671
00:39:56,632 --> 00:39:57,864
you and me.

672
00:39:58,333 --> 00:39:59,186
What?

673
00:39:59,697 --> 00:40:00,950
Imagine that!

674
00:40:05,663 --> 00:40:06,366
Murph...

675
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:08,671
You have no idea when you are coming back.

676
00:40:10,878 --> 00:40:12,378
No idea at all!

677
00:40:15,543 --> 00:40:17,981
Murph don't.
Don't make me leave like this.

678
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:19,035
Come on Murph!

679
00:40:19,841 --> 00:40:21,809
Don't make me leave like this Murph!

680
00:40:29,917 --> 00:40:30,727
Hey...

681
00:40:31,463 --> 00:40:32,500
I love you.

682
00:40:33,063 --> 00:40:34,664
Forever. You hear me?

683
00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:36,631
I love you forever,

684
00:40:37,045 --> 00:40:38,362
and I am coming back.

685
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:45,434
I am coming back.

686
00:41:03,987 --> 00:41:04,971
How did it go?

687
00:41:05,527 --> 00:41:06,515
Fine.

688
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:07,643
Just fine.

689
00:41:15,122 --> 00:41:16,153
I love you Tom.

690
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,051
Travel safe?
Yeah.

691
00:41:18,685 --> 00:41:20,426
You look after our place for me alright?

692
00:41:21,104 --> 00:41:21,973
Alright?

693
00:41:27,554 --> 00:41:29,100
Hey can I use your truck
while you are gone?

694
00:41:29,279 --> 00:41:30,502
You mean your truck?

695
00:41:32,317 --> 00:41:33,783
I will make sure they bring it back.

696
00:41:36,205 --> 00:41:37,674
Look after my kids Donald!

697
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:54,127
<i>Go for main engine start. T-minus 10...</i>

698
00:41:55,065 --> 00:41:55,753
Dad!

699
00:41:55,777 --> 00:41:56,637
<i>Nine.</i>

700
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:57,659
Dad!

701
00:41:58,922 --> 00:41:59,729
<i>Eight.</i>

702
00:42:01,429 --> 00:42:02,219
<i>Seven.</i>

703
00:42:02,387 --> 00:42:03,351
Dad!

704
00:42:03,972 --> 00:42:04,797
<i>Six.</i>

705
00:42:06,496 --> 00:42:07,221
<i>Five.</i>

00:42:07,245 --> 00:42:08,681
<i>Main engine start.</i>

707
00:42:08,727 --> 00:42:09,436
<i>Four.</i>

708
00:42:10,848 --> 00:42:11,558
<i>Three.</i>

709
00:42:12,536 --> 00:42:13,253
<i>Two.</i>

00:42:14,558 --> 00:42:15,187
<i>One.</i>

00:42:15,211 --> 00:42:16,642
<i>Booster ignition and...</i>

712
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:28,506
All engines look good.
Beginning roll program.

713
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:35,227
Prepare for stage one separation.

714
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:36,845
Stage one.

715
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,347
There is Mach 1.

716
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:46,761
Everybody good?

717
00:42:46,785 --> 00:42:48,870
Plenty of slaves for my robot colony?

718
00:42:51,194 --> 00:42:54,323
They gave him a humor setting
so he would fit in better with his unit.

719
00:42:54,986 --> 00:42:56,490
He thinks it relaxes us.

720
00:42:56,658 --> 00:42:59,236
A giant sarcastic robot.

721
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:01,745
What a great idea!

722
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:04,623
I have a cue light I can use
when I am joking if you like.

723
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:05,832
That had probably help.

724
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,907
Yeah you can use it to find
your way back to the ship,

725
00:43:07,931 --> 00:43:09,433
after I blow you out the airlock.

726
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:12,745
What's your humor setting TARS?

727
00:43:12,769 --> 00:43:14,007
That's 100 percent.

728
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:15,968
Let's bring it on down to 75 please.

729
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:18,136
Stage two separation.

730
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:30,577
All feeds going manual.

731
00:43:31,276 --> 00:43:32,491
Going manual.

732
00:43:34,988 --> 00:43:37,285
Deactivate probe heater,
one, two and three.

733
00:43:37,463 --> 00:43:38,426
Check.

734
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:45,277
Taking control.

735
00:43:45,301 --> 00:43:47,050
This is handover to you.

736
00:43:50,712 --> 00:43:52,613
A.D.F. check.
Over.

737
00:43:53,448 --> 00:43:57,118
Pull thrusters back.
Fuel cells, one, two, three.

738
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:58,455
One hundred percent.

739
00:43:58,678 --> 00:44:00,182
Ex-mites.

740
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,315
It's hard leaving everything.

741
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:12,555
My kids.

742
00:44:13,562 --> 00:44:14,409
Your father.

743
00:44:15,039 --> 00:44:17,208
We are going to be spending
a lot of time together.

744
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:18,811
We should learn to talk.

745
00:44:19,452 --> 00:44:20,583
And when not to.

746
00:44:22,631 --> 00:44:23,942
Just being honest.

747
00:44:24,412 --> 00:44:26,347
I don't think you need to be that honest.

748
00:44:27,063 --> 00:44:29,481
Hey TARS, what's your honesty parameter?

749
00:44:29,751 --> 00:44:30,781
Ninety percent.

750
00:44:31,174 --> 00:44:32,377
Ninety percent?

751
00:44:32,402 --> 00:44:35,219
Absolute honesty isn't always
the most diplomatic

752
00:44:35,244 --> 00:44:38,531
nor the safest form of communication
with emotional beings.

753
00:44:38,594 --> 00:44:39,531
Ok.

754
00:44:40,248 --> 00:44:42,546
Ninety percent it is Dr. Brand.

755
00:44:46,768 --> 00:44:48,257
We are coming up on the Endurance.

756
00:44:48,508 --> 00:44:49,650
Twelve minutes out.

757
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,681
Ok. Taking control.

758
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,954
Approaching module port, 500 meters.

759
00:45:28,676 --> 00:45:29,801
It's all you Doyle.

760
00:45:47,996 --> 00:45:50,779
Nice and easy Doyle.
Nice and easy.

761
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:56,808
I feel good.

762
00:45:57,359 --> 00:45:58,526
Take us home.

763
00:46:06,282 --> 00:46:07,037
Lock.

764
00:46:07,201 --> 00:46:08,123
Target locked?

765
00:46:08,148 --> 00:46:09,171
Target locked.
Well done.

766
00:46:09,366 --> 00:46:10,459
Ok, helmets on.

767
00:46:10,643 --> 00:46:11,506
Good job.

768
00:46:45,222 --> 00:46:46,366
Door is not charging.

769
00:46:46,897 --> 00:46:48,131
Never mind.

770
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:12,782
Cooper you should have control.

771
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:14,524
Control here.

772
00:47:16,292 --> 00:47:18,509
<i>Communication with ring module active.</i>

773
00:47:32,725 --> 00:47:33,989
That's initiate.

774
00:47:41,442 --> 00:47:43,551
Are we ready to spin?
Just a sec.

775
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:56,320
Hello CASE.

776
00:47:56,484 --> 00:47:57,407
Hello TARS.

777
00:47:58,668 --> 00:48:00,149
Alright, we are all set.

778
00:48:01,045 --> 00:48:02,175
Alright, let's do it.

779
00:48:31,747 --> 00:48:33,271
Thirty percent of spin.

780
00:48:39,854 --> 00:48:40,784
<i>One G.</i>

781
00:48:42,003 --> 00:48:44,004
<i>How is gravity treating you back there?</i>

782
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:45,315
Well.

783
00:48:48,676 --> 00:48:50,468
Romilly? Hey, you ok?

784
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:51,738
Yeah.
You alright?

785
00:48:52,239 --> 00:48:53,605
Yeah, I just need a minute.

786
00:48:54,423 --> 00:48:57,668
Ok, I think we have some Dramamine
in the hab pod I am just gonna get that

787
00:48:57,693 --> 00:48:59,553
or maybe in the cryo-beds.
I will just be a sec.

788
00:48:59,601 --> 00:49:01,138
Hey Brand?
Yeah?

789
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:02,700
Bring a lot.

That's a lot of Dramamine.

798
00:49:27,404 --> 00:49:29,326
Look after my family will you please sir?

799

<i>We will be waiting for you

You good?
Yeah.

818
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:31,754
Ok, thank you.

819
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:36,598
Here. Pills.

820
00:50:39,537 --> 00:50:40,801
So alone.

821
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:43,574
We have each other.
Dr. Mann had it worse.

822
00:50:43,691 --> 00:50:45,067
No, I mean them.

823
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:49,533
It's a perfect planet and we are not
gonna find another one like her.

824
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:51,787
No, it's not like...

825
00:50:52,279 --> 00:50:53,942
looking for a new condo.

826
00:50:54,677 --> 00:50:56,662
The human race is going to be...

827
00:50:57,046 --> 00:50:57,951
adrift...

828
00:50:58,556 --> 00:51:01,658
desperate for a rock it can cling
to while it catches its breath.

829
00:51:02,443 --> 00:51:03,925
We need to find that rock.

830
00:51:04,918 --> 00:51:07,344
And our three prospects are at the edge

831
00:51:07,368 --> 00:51:09,355
of what might sustain human life.

832
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:11,223
Laura Miller's planet,

833
00:51:11,265 --> 00:51:12,345

834
00:51:12,554 --> 00:51:14,780
Laura started our biology program and...

835
00:51:19,934 --> 00:51:21,358
Wolf Edmunds is here.

836
00:51:21,522 --> 00:51:22,643
Tell me about Edmunds.

837
00:51:24,853 --> 00:51:26,360
Wolf is a particle physicist.

838
00:51:28,878 --> 00:51:30,595
None of them had families?

839
00:51:32,256 --> 00:51:33,745
No. No attachments.

840
00:51:33,769 --> 00:51:35,133
My father insisted.

841
00:51:35,301 --> 00:51:38,845
They all knew the odds against ever
seeing another human being again.

842
00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:40,973
I am hoping we can surprise
at least three of them.

843
00:51:41,046 --> 00:51:42,963
How about Mann?
Dr. Mann?

844
00:51:43,170 --> 00:51:45,088
He is remarkable. He is the best of us.

845
00:51:45,311 --> 00:51:49,689
He inspired 11 people to follow him
on the loneliest journey in human history.

846
00:51:49,857 --> 00:51:51,441
Scientists, explorers.

847
00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:52,805
That's what I love.

848
00:51:53,401 --> 00:51:55,992
You know out there we face great odds.

849
00:51:56,134 --> 00:51:57,312
Death but...

850
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:00,312
not evil.

851
00:52:00,930 --> 00:52:02,681
You don't think nature can be evil?

852
00:52:03,026 --> 00:52:03,608
No.

853
00:52:03,717 --> 00:52:05,528
Formidable. Frightening. But...

854
00:52:06,582 --> 00:52:07,983
no, not evil.

855
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:10,657
Is a lion,

856
00:52:10,954 --> 00:52:12,958
evil because it rips a gazelle to shreds?

857
00:52:13,484 --> 00:52:15,163
Just what we take with us then.

858
00:52:16,028 --> 00:52:16,781
Yeah.

859
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:19,636
This crew represents the best of humanity.

860
00:52:19,804 --> 00:52:20,922
Even me?

861
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:23,139
You know what? We agreed 90 percent.

862
00:52:23,494 --> 00:52:24,517
There you go.

863
00:52:24,809 --> 00:52:26,939
Don't stay up.
I will be there in a minute.

864
00:52:27,353 --> 00:52:28,814
Hold on, just remember Coop,

865
00:52:28,922 --> 00:52:31,002
you are literally wasting your breath.

866
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:39,061
Hey TARS?

867
00:52:39,085 --> 00:52:40,939
Let's go over that trajectory one more time.

868
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:42,986
Eight months to Mars.

869
00:52:43,744 --> 00:52:45,609
Counter-orbital slingshot around.

870
00:52:45,633 --> 00:52:48,164
Fourteen months to Saturn.
Nothing is changed on that.

871
00:52:48,189 --> 00:52:49,509
Just let me ask you something.

872
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:54,747
Dr. Brand and Edmunds...
Why are you whispering?

873
00:52:54,772 --> 00:52:55,834
They can't hear you.

874
00:52:57,591 --> 00:52:59,178
Dr. Brand and Edmunds.

875
00:52:59,918 --> 00:53:00,865
They close?

876
00:53:01,045 --> 00:53:02,115
I would not know.

877
00:53:02,244 --> 00:53:05,119
Is that 90 percent would not know
or 10 percent would not know?

878
00:53:05,283 --> 00:53:07,310
I also have a discretion setting Cooper.

879
00:53:10,104 --> 00:53:11,822
But not a poker face Slick.

880
00:53:24,406 --> 00:53:25,453
Hey guys.

881
00:53:26,597 --> 00:53:28,992
Dad is about to go down for the long nap.

882
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:32,156
So I wanted to give you an update.

883
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:36,279
The Earth looks amazing from here.

884
00:53:38,424 --> 00:53:40,208
You can't see any of the dust.

885
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:44,940
<i>I really hope you guys are doing great.</i>

886
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:48,004
<i>I know you will get this message.
Professor Brand,</i>

887
00:53:48,029 --> 00:53:50,144
<i>assured me that he will get it to you.</i>

888
00:53:50,686 --> 00:53:52,237
<i>Know that I love you.</i>

889
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:56,257
Is it him?
I don't think so Murph.

890
00:54:03,584 --> 00:54:04,841
You must be Donald.

891
00:54:07,044 --> 00:54:08,021
Hello Murph.

892
00:54:09,163 --> 00:54:10,888
Why are you in my dad's truck?

893
00:54:11,735 --> 00:54:13,421
He wanted me to bring it for your brother.

894
00:54:14,610 --> 00:54:16,562
He sent you a message.

895
00:54:20,171 --> 00:54:21,950
She is pretty upset with him for leaving.

896
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:25,707
If you record any messages I can
get them to transmit it to Cooper.

897
00:54:27,251 --> 00:54:28,003
Murph,

898
00:54:28,182 --> 00:54:29,653
is a bright spark.

899
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:31,840
Maybe,

900
00:54:32,007 --> 00:54:33,405
I should fan the flame.

901
00:54:33,749 --> 00:54:35,772
She is already making
fools of her teachers.

902
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:38,640
So maybe she should come
and make a fool out of you.

903
00:54:40,361 --> 00:54:41,183
So where are they?

904
00:54:41,745 --> 00:54:43,017
Heading for Mars.

905
00:54:43,906 --> 00:54:45,645
The next time you hear from Cooper,

906
00:54:45,911 --> 00:54:47,767
they will be coming up on Saturn.

907
00:55:27,266 --> 00:55:28,786
<i>As far as school goes</i>

908
00:55:28,943 --> 00:55:32,405
<i>the administration wants me to repeat
Plant Pathology. Which sucks.</i>

909
00:55:33,312 --> 00:55:33,902
<i>But,</i>

910
00:55:34,081 --> 00:55:36,678
<i>they said I could start
Advanced Agriculture a year early.</i>

911
00:55:38,398 --> 00:55:40,492
<i>Alright, I got to go Dad.</i>

912
00:55:40,711 --> 00:55:42,070
<i>Hope you are safe up there.</i>

913
00:55:46,745 --> 00:55:47,927
<i>Sorry Coop.</i>

914
00:55:48,095 --> 00:55:49,876
<i>I asked Murph to say hi...</i>

915
00:55:50,126 --> 00:55:52,613
<i>but she is as stubborn as her old man.</i>

916
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:54,736
I will try again next time.

917
00:56:10,285 --> 00:56:11,741
You alright Rom?

918
00:56:14,324 --> 00:56:15,754
This gets to me Cooper.

919
00:56:16,123 --> 00:56:17,488
This. This.

920
00:56:18,292 --> 00:56:20,949
Millimeters of aluminum
that's it and then nothing...

921
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:23,243
out there for millions of miles,

922
00:56:23,447 --> 00:56:24,872
won't kill us in seconds.

923
00:56:26,359 --> 00:56:28,122
You know that some of the finest

924
00:56:28,302 --> 00:56:31,841
solo yachtsmen in the world
don't know how to swim?

925
00:56:32,668 --> 00:56:33,670
They don't know how.

926
00:56:33,694 --> 00:56:35,444
And if they go overboard
psst they are done.

927
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:39,201
We are explorers Rom.

928
00:56:41,148 --> 00:56:42,303
This is our boat.

929
00:56:43,025 --> 00:56:43,946
Here.

930
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:13,097
This is from the relay probe?

931
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:15,313
It was in orbit around the wormhole.

932
00:57:15,724 --> 00:57:18,503
This is the wormhole,
and every time we come around...

933
00:57:19,029 --> 00:57:22,153
we would receive images from the other
side of the foreign galaxy.

934
00:57:22,481 --> 00:57:24,607
Oh yeah.
Like swinging a periscope around.

935
00:57:24,775 --> 00:57:25,674
Exactly.

936
00:57:26,026 --> 00:57:27,866
So we got a pretty good idea

937
00:57:28,009 --> 00:57:29,872
what we are gonna find on the other side?

938
00:57:31,498 --> 00:57:32,832
Navigationally.

939
00:57:34,299 --> 00:57:37,679
<i>Guys? Looks like we will be approaching
the wormhole in about three hours.</i>

940
00:57:44,545 --> 00:57:45,499
Hey Coop?

941
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,739
Can we stop the spinning?

942
00:57:48,311 --> 00:57:49,153
Why?

943
00:57:49,562 --> 00:57:51,551
Because we are close enough to see it now?

944
00:57:53,804 --> 00:57:54,731
Alright.

945
00:57:54,997 --> 00:57:56,080
Thanks.

946
00:58:01,937 --> 00:58:04,288
There that's... That's it!
That's the wormhole!

947
00:58:04,329 --> 00:58:06,122
Say it don't spray it Rom.

948
00:58:06,233 --> 00:58:07,366
It's a sphere.

949
00:58:07,693 --> 00:58:09,257
Of course it is. What you...

950
00:58:09,602 --> 00:58:11,172
You thought it would just be a hole?

951
00:58:12,763 --> 00:58:16,004
No it's just that all the illustrations
I have ever seen they...

952
00:58:16,359 --> 00:58:19,184
The illustrations they are
trying to show you how it works.

953
00:58:20,289 --> 00:58:22,362
So they say you want to go from here...

954
00:58:23,351 --> 00:58:24,374
to there.

955
00:58:24,591 --> 00:58:26,235
But it's too far right?

956
00:58:27,171 --> 00:58:29,536
So a wormhole bends space like this,

957
00:58:29,684 --> 00:58:31,546
so you can take a shortcut through...

958
00:58:32,105 --> 00:58:33,327
a higher dimension.

959
00:58:33,872 --> 00:58:35,163
Ok so...

960
00:58:35,846 --> 00:58:38,680
to show that they ave turned
three-dimensional space

961
00:58:38,776 --> 00:58:42,090
into two dimensions which turns
a wormhole into two dimensions...

962
00:58:42,399 --> 00:58:43,477
a circle.

963
00:58:44,006 --> 00:58:45,891
What's a circle in three dimensions?

964
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:49,101
A sphere.
Exactly.

965
00:58:49,317 --> 00:58:50,508
A spherical hole.

966
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:52,726
But who put it there?

967
00:58:52,859 --> 00:58:54,431
Who do we have to thank?

968
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:58,748
I am not thanking anybody until we get
out of here in one piece Rom.

969
00:59:06,225 --> 00:59:07,742
Any trick to this Doyle?

970
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:10,639
No one knows.

971
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:19,675
The others made it right?

972
00:59:21,892 --> 00:59:23,410
At least some of them.

973
00:59:55,509 --> 00:59:58,678
Everybody ready to say goodbye
to our solar system?

974
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:00,955
To our galaxy.

975
01:00:03,475 --> 01:00:04,517
Here we go.

976
01:00:37,078 --> 01:00:38,414
The controls won't work here.

977
01:00:38,852 --> 01:00:40,524
We are passing through the bulk.

978
01:00:40,749 --> 01:00:42,673
It's space beyond our three dimensions.

979
01:00:43,039 --> 01:00:45,110
All you can do is record and observe.

980
01:00:56,403 --> 01:00:57,445
What is that?

981
01:01:00,034 --> 01:01:01,430
I think it's them.

982
01:01:01,992 --> 01:01:03,651
Distorting space-time.

983
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:06,996
Don't! Don't!

984
01:01:34,830 --> 01:01:36,080
What was that?

985
01:01:39,153 --> 01:01:40,348
The first handshake.

986
01:01:42,249 --> 01:01:43,221
We are...

987
01:01:45,018 --> 01:01:46,049
We are here.

988
01:02:06,807 --> 01:02:08,943
So the lost communications came through.

989
01:02:09,108 --> 01:02:09,827
How?

990
01:02:10,138 --> 01:02:11,998
The relay on this side cached them.

991
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:15,268
So years of basic data. No real surprises.

992
01:02:16,533 --> 01:02:19,714
Miller's site has kept pinging
thumbs up as has Dr. Mann's.

993
01:02:20,388 --> 01:02:22,393
Edmunds' went down three years ago.

994
01:02:23,031 --> 01:02:24,240
Transmitter failure?

995
01:02:24,408 --> 01:02:25,229
Maybe.

996
01:02:25,253 --> 01:02:27,398
He was sending the thumbs
up right until it went dark.

997
01:02:27,445 --> 01:02:29,205
But Miller is still looks good though right?

998
01:02:29,816 --> 01:02:31,709
Because she is coming up fast.

999
01:02:32,149 --> 01:02:33,650
With one complication.

1000
01:02:34,668 --> 01:02:37,388
The planet is much closer
to Gargantua than we thought.

1001
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:38,785
Gargantua?

1002
01:02:38,930 --> 01:02:40,604
It's what we are calling the black hole.

1003
01:02:40,629 --> 01:02:42,794
Miller's and Dr. Mann's planets
both orbit it.

1004
01:02:42,835 --> 01:02:44,958
And Miller's is on the horizon?

1005
01:02:44,982 --> 01:02:46,402
As a basketball around a hoop.

1006
01:02:46,513 --> 01:02:48,550
Landing there takes us dangerously close.

1007
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:51,827
And a black hole that big has
a huge gravitational pull.

1008
01:02:54,664 --> 01:02:57,602
Look I could swing around that neutron
star to decelerate.

1009
01:02:57,627 --> 01:02:59,503
No it's not that. It's time.

1010
01:02:59,663 --> 01:03:02,545
The gravity on that planet will slow
our clock compared to Earth...

1011
01:03:03,111 --> 01:03:04,362
is drastically.

1012
01:03:04,865 --> 01:03:05,780
How bad?

1013
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:08,843
Every hour we spend
on that planet will be...

1014
01:03:10,510 --> 01:03:12,678
seven years back on Earth.

1015
01:03:13,665 --> 01:03:14,507
Jesus.

1016
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:16,709
Well that's relativity folks.

1017
01:03:18,128 --> 01:03:20,588
Well we can't just drop
down there without...

1018
01:03:20,755 --> 01:03:22,631
Cooper, we have a mission.

1019
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:25,729
Yeah Doyle we have a mission
and our mission Plan A is...

1020
01:03:25,754 --> 01:03:29,182
to find a planet that can habitate the
people that are living on Earth right now.

1021
01:03:29,207 --> 01:03:31,847
You can't just think about your family.
Now you have to think bigger than that alright?

1022
01:03:31,872 --> 01:03:35,066
I am thinking about my family
and millions of other families ok?

1023
01:03:35,099 --> 01:03:36,484
Plan A does not work,

1024
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:39,352
if the people on Earth
are dead by the time we pull it off.

1025
01:03:40,668 --> 01:03:42,067
No. It doesn't.

1026
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:44,200
That's why there is a Plan B.

1027
01:03:46,296 --> 01:03:47,228
Ok.

1028
01:03:47,252 --> 01:03:48,206
Cooper is right.

1029
01:03:48,231 --> 01:03:50,793
We need to think about time as a resource
just like oxygen and food.

1030
01:03:50,818 --> 01:03:52,275
Going down there is going to cost us.

1031
01:03:54,133 --> 01:03:55,057
Alright look.

1032
01:03:56,792 --> 01:03:58,573
Dr. Mann's data is promising.

1033
01:03:58,597 --> 01:04:00,657
Right? But it's going
to take us months to get there.

1034
01:04:00,782 --> 01:04:02,532
And Edmunds' it's even further.

1035
01:04:02,591 --> 01:04:05,413
Now Miller has not sent much
but what she has is very promising.

1036
01:04:05,437 --> 01:04:07,068
It's water it's organics...

1037
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:09,399
You don't find that every day.
No you don't.

1038
01:04:09,429 --> 01:04:10,942
And just think about the resources

1039
01:04:10,967 --> 01:04:13,927
including time that would be
spent trying to get back here.

1040
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:17,053
Romilly.
Yeah?

1041
01:04:17,121 --> 01:04:19,674
How far off from Miller's planet do we have
to be,

1042
01:04:19,698 --> 01:04:21,393
to stay out of the time shift?

1043
01:04:21,675 --> 01:04:23,042
Well just back from the cusp.

1044
01:04:23,439 --> 01:04:26,198
Alright which is here,
just outside of Miller's planet.

1045
01:04:26,223 --> 01:04:27,737
Right.
Ok.

1046
01:04:29,065 --> 01:04:30,521
Here is Gargantua.

1047
01:04:30,545 --> 01:04:31,992
Here is Miller's planet.

1048
01:04:32,507 --> 01:04:35,526
Instead of taking the Endurance
into orbit around Miller's planet

1049
01:04:35,551 --> 01:04:38,180
which would conserve fuel
but we would lose a lot of time...

1050
01:04:38,359 --> 01:04:39,238
what if we...

1051
01:04:39,383 --> 01:04:41,717
take a wider
orbit around Gargantua

1052
01:04:41,742 --> 01:04:45,084
parallel with Miller's planet outside
of this time shift to here?

1053
01:04:45,465 --> 01:04:47,455
Then we take the Ranger down
we get Miller,

1054
01:04:47,588 --> 01:04:48,606
we get her samples.

1055
01:04:48,631 --> 01:04:51,248
We come back we analyze
we debrief. We are in we are out.

1056
01:04:51,304 --> 01:04:53,639
We lose a little fuel
but we save a whole lot of time.

1057
01:04:53,707 --> 01:04:55,641
That will work.
That's good.

1058
01:04:55,666 --> 01:04:58,314
There is not gonna be time for monkey
business or chit-chat down there.

1059
01:04:58,339 --> 01:05:00,714
TARS you should definitely stay here.

1060
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:03,571
CASE, you are with me.
Anyone else can stay.

1061
01:05:03,817 --> 01:05:05,973
If we are talking about a couple of years,

1062
01:05:06,370 --> 01:05:08,024
I could use the time to research gravity.

1063
01:05:08,049 --> 01:05:10,631
Observations from the wormhole
that's gold to Professor Brand.

1064
01:05:10,854 --> 01:05:12,634
TARS factor an orbit of Gargantua.

1065
01:05:12,737 --> 01:05:14,940
Conserve fuel, minimize thrusting,

1066
01:05:15,132 --> 01:05:17,430
but make sure we stay
in range of Miller's planet.

1067
01:05:17,455 --> 01:05:19,507
You got it?
I would not leave you behind...

1068
01:05:20,260 --> 01:05:21,302
Dr. Brand.

1069
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:27,345
You ready CASE?
Yup.

1070
01:05:28,466 --> 01:05:29,831
You don't say much do you?

1071
01:05:29,964 --> 01:05:31,915
TARS talks plenty for both of us.

1072
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:34,173
Detach.

1073
01:05:41,451 --> 01:05:43,344
Romilly are you reading these forces?

1074
01:05:43,368 --> 01:05:44,569
<i>It's unbelievable.</i>

1075
01:05:47,694 --> 01:05:49,348
A literal heart of darkness.

1076
01:05:53,992 --> 01:05:56,702
If we could just see
the collapsed star inside...

1077
01:05:56,870 --> 01:05:57,984
the singularity,

1078
01:05:58,234 --> 01:05:59,848
yeah we would solve gravity.

1079
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:01,663
And we can't get anything from it?

1080
01:06:01,688 --> 01:06:03,358
<i>Nothing escapes that horizon.</i>

1081
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:04,588
Not even light.

1082
01:06:04,831 --> 01:06:07,065
<i>The answer is there, just no way to see it.</i>

1083
01:06:07,446 --> 01:06:08,666
There is Miller's planet.

1084
01:06:11,176 --> 01:06:12,509
Goodbye Ranger.

1085
01:06:25,315 --> 01:06:27,408
This is fast for atmospheric entry.

1086
01:06:27,676 --> 01:06:29,927
Should we use the thrusters to slow?
No.

1087
01:06:30,487 --> 01:06:33,822
I am gonna use the Ranger's aerodynamics
to save some fuel.

1088
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:35,122
Air brake?

1089
01:06:35,367 --> 01:06:36,844
We want to get down fast, don't we?

1090
01:06:36,988 --> 01:06:38,744
Actually we want to get
there in one piece.

1091
01:06:39,079 --> 01:06:40,130
Hang on.

1092
01:06:40,455 --> 01:06:42,206
Brand, Doyle, get ready.

1093
01:06:58,331 --> 01:07:00,532
We should ease!
Hands where I can see them CASE.

1094
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:03,936
It's the only time I ever went down was when
a machine was easing at the wrong time.

1095
01:07:04,104 --> 01:07:07,322
A little caution...
Can get you killed just like reckless driving.

1096
01:07:07,365 --> 01:07:09,532
Cooper it's too damn fast!
I got this.

1097
01:07:14,377 --> 01:07:16,312
Should I disable the feedback?
No.

1098
01:07:16,804 --> 01:07:18,659
I need to feel the air.

1099
01:07:22,422 --> 01:07:23,422
Here we go.

1100
01:07:26,584 --> 01:07:27,781
It's just water!

1101
01:07:29,379 --> 01:07:30,664
The stuff of life.

1102
01:07:31,339 --> 01:07:32,628
Twelve hundred meters.

1103
01:07:32,924 --> 01:07:34,967
Do we have a fix on the beacon?
Got it!

1104
01:07:35,135 --> 01:07:37,355
Can you maneuver?
I will need to shave some speed.

1105
01:07:37,929 --> 01:07:40,556
I am gonna spiral down on top of it.
Everybody hang on!

1106
01:07:42,976 --> 01:07:44,017
Seven hundred.

1107
01:07:46,146 --> 01:07:48,147
On my cue CASE. On my cue.

1108
01:07:51,651 --> 01:07:52,868
Five hundred meters.

1109
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:03,662
Fire!

1110
01:08:17,218 --> 01:08:18,379
Very graceful.

1111
01:08:18,470 --> 01:08:19,395
No.

1112
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:21,335
But very...

1113
01:08:22,015 --> 01:08:23,018
efficient.

1114
01:08:24,726 --> 01:08:25,881
What are you waiting for?

1115
01:08:26,010 --> 01:08:26,935
Let's go!

1116
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:28,839
Go, go, go, go, go!

1117
01:08:29,224 --> 01:08:31,137
Seven years per hour here.

1118
01:08:31,161 --> 01:08:32,417
Let's make it count!

1119
01:08:58,802 --> 01:08:59,776
This way.

1120
01:09:02,889 --> 01:09:04,338
About 200 meters.

1121
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:15,579
The gravity is punishing.

1122
01:09:16,736 --> 01:09:18,696
Been floating through space too long?

1123
01:09:19,030 --> 01:09:21,009
One hundred and thirty percent
Earth gravity.

1124
01:09:21,407 --> 01:09:23,282
Come on. Come on.

1125
01:09:26,037 --> 01:09:28,461
There is nothing here.
Should be right here.

1126
01:09:30,792 --> 01:09:31,614
If the...

1127
01:09:32,083 --> 01:09:34,239
signal is coming from here, then...

1128
01:09:43,329 --> 01:09:44,356
Her beacon.

1129
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:53,772
Wreckage.

1130
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:55,607
<i>Where is the rest?</i>

1131
01:09:56,109 --> 01:09:57,384
Towards the mountains!

1132
01:10:01,347 --> 01:10:02,546
Those are not mountains.

1133
01:10:04,851 --> 01:10:06,077
They are waves.

1134
01:10:11,624 --> 01:10:13,114
Oh shit. Oh shit.

1135
01:10:13,521 --> 01:10:14,530
Shit.

1136
01:10:14,794 --> 01:10:16,795
<i>Now that one is moving away from us.</i>

1137
01:10:23,203 --> 01:10:24,508
We need the recorder.

1138
01:10:35,148 --> 01:10:37,399
Brand, Doyle, back to the Ranger now!

1139
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:40,944
We are not leaving without her data.

1140
01:10:41,112 --> 01:10:42,446
Get back here now!

1141
01:10:42,614 --> 01:10:44,178
<i>We do not have time!</i>

1142
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:47,123
The second wave is coming!
We are in the middle of a swell.

1143
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:49,265
No I got it.

1144
01:10:49,829 --> 01:10:51,830
Get your ass back to the Ranger now!

1145
01:10:56,836 --> 01:10:58,879
Brand get back here now!

1146
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:03,152
No Cooper go. Cooper go.
I can't make it.

1147
01:11:03,468 --> 01:11:05,636
Go!
CASE go get her.

1148
01:11:10,689 --> 01:11:11,380
Go!

1149
01:11:11,404 --> 01:11:12,841
Get up. Get up Brand!

1150
01:11:13,561 --> 01:11:14,732
Go, go! Go!

1151
01:11:16,648 --> 01:11:17,761
I am not gonna make it!

1152
01:11:17,786 --> 01:11:19,685
Yes you are. Yes you are!

1153
01:11:26,511 --> 01:11:29,323
Come on CASE has her. CASE has her!
Get back here Doyle!

1154
01:11:31,621 --> 01:11:32,605
Come on!

1155
01:11:35,358 --> 01:11:36,482
Get to the hatch!

1156
01:11:41,322 --> 01:11:42,622
Go, go! Go!

1157
01:11:48,471 --> 01:11:49,554
Shit.

1158
01:11:50,056 --> 01:11:51,890
Manually overriding inside hatch!

1159
01:11:55,395 --> 01:11:56,707
Cooper! Wait!

1160
01:12:03,803 --> 01:12:05,309
The engines are flooded!

1161
01:12:05,622 --> 01:12:07,326
I am gonna have to shut her down.

1162
01:12:40,924 --> 01:12:42,011
Holy shit.

1163
01:12:46,779 --> 01:12:47,887
Hang on!

1164
01:13:19,353 --> 01:13:20,747
CASE what's the problem?

1165
01:13:20,772 --> 01:13:22,819
Too waterlogged. Let it drain.

1166
01:13:24,317 --> 01:13:25,525
Goddamn it!

1167
01:13:25,693 --> 01:13:27,766
I told you to leave me!
And I told you

1168
01:13:27,790 --> 01:13:30,130
Why didn't you leave me?
To get your ass back here!

1169
01:13:30,531 --> 01:13:32,778
The difference is one of us
was thinking about the mission!

1170
01:13:32,803 --> 01:13:34,703
Cooper you were
thinking about getting home.

1171
01:13:37,038 --> 01:13:38,921
I was trying to do the right thing!

1172
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:41,069
Can you tell that to Doyle?

1173
01:13:43,593 --> 01:13:44,742
CASE how much time?

1174
01:13:44,882 --> 01:13:46,273
Forty-five to an hour.

1175
01:13:47,757 --> 01:13:49,091
The stuff of life?

1176
01:13:50,009 --> 01:13:51,562
What's this gonna cost us Brand?

1177
01:13:52,345 --> 01:13:53,334
A lot.

1178
01:13:53,787 --> 01:13:54,594
Decades.

1179
01:14:01,806 --> 01:14:03,139
What happened to Miller?

1180
01:14:03,606 --> 01:14:04,595
Judging by...

1181
01:14:05,176 --> 01:14:06,518
the wreckage she was,

1182
01:14:06,574 --> 01:14:09,152
broken up by a wave soon after impact.

1183
01:14:09,538 --> 01:14:12,066
How is the wreckage stayed together
after all these years?

1184
01:14:13,407 --> 01:14:15,193
Because of the time slippage.

1185
01:14:16,481 --> 01:14:18,108
On this planet's time she...

1186
01:14:18,624 --> 01:14:20,779
just landed hours ago, she...

1187
01:14:21,958 --> 01:14:23,864
She probably just died minutes ago.

1188
01:14:24,502 --> 01:14:28,043
The data Doyle received was just
the initial status, echoing endlessly.

1189
01:14:28,923 --> 01:14:30,715
Oh we are not prepared for this.

1190
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:36,795
You eggheads have the survival
skills of a Boy Scout troop.

1191
01:14:37,098 --> 01:14:38,792
Well we got this far on our brains.

1192
01:14:38,816 --> 01:14:40,350
Farther than any human in history.

1193
01:14:40,518 --> 01:14:41,802
Well not far enough!

1194
01:14:42,436 --> 01:14:43,842
And now we are stuck here,

1195
01:14:43,866 --> 01:14:45,939
untill there won't be
anyone left on Earth to save.

1196
01:14:48,985 --> 01:14:51,420
I am counting every minute
same as you Cooper.

1197
01:14:56,450 --> 01:14:57,815
Is there any possibility,

1198
01:14:58,193 --> 01:14:59,545
I don't know some...

1199
01:14:59,701 --> 01:15:01,235
some kind of a way we can maybe
all jump...

1200
01:15:01,545 --> 01:15:03,466
in a black hole.
Gain back the years?

1201
01:15:04,584 --> 01:15:06,084
Don't shake your head at me.

1202
01:15:06,252 --> 01:15:08,253
Time is relative, ok?

1203
01:15:08,399 --> 01:15:10,953
It can stretch and it can squeeze but...

1204
01:15:11,966 --> 01:15:13,247
it can't run backwards.

1205
01:15:13,664 --> 01:15:15,874
It just can't.
The only thing that can move,

1206
01:15:15,898 --> 01:15:17,511
across dimensions like time,

1207
01:15:17,535 --> 01:15:18,763
is gravity.

1208
01:15:21,475 --> 01:15:22,272
Ok.

1209
01:15:24,564 --> 01:15:26,427
The beings that led us here,

1210
01:15:27,064 --> 01:15:28,441
they communicate...

1211
01:15:28,649 --> 01:15:30,501
through gravity right?
Yes.

1212
01:15:31,007 --> 01:15:32,845
Could they be talking
to us from the future?

1213
01:15:33,738 --> 01:15:35,989
Maybe.
Ok. If they can...

1214
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:37,813
They...

1215
01:15:38,363 --> 01:15:40,277
are beings of five dimensions.

1216
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:44,206
To them time might be
another physical dimension.

1217
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:45,325
To them...

1218
01:15:46,292 --> 01:15:50,462
the past might be a canyon that they can
climb into and the future...

1219
01:15:50,487 --> 01:15:52,286
a mountain they can climb up.
But to us...

1220
01:15:52,450 --> 01:15:53,629
it's not ok?

1221
01:15:54,717 --> 01:15:56,165
Look Cooper I screwed up.

1222
01:15:56,571 --> 01:15:57,745
I am sorry.

1223
01:15:59,422 --> 01:16:01,158
But you knew about relativity.

1224
01:16:04,268 --> 01:16:05,018
Brand...

1225
01:16:10,316 --> 01:16:11,768
My daughter was 10 years old.

1226
01:16:12,860 --> 01:16:15,265
I could not teach her
Einstein's theories before I left.

1227
01:16:16,283 --> 01:16:18,397
Could not you have told her you
were going to save the world?

1228
01:16:19,492 --> 01:16:20,233
No.

1229
01:16:22,203 --> 01:16:23,442
When you become a parent,

1230
01:16:24,169 --> 01:16:25,827
one thing becomes really clear.

1231
01:16:27,875 --> 01:16:30,343
And that is that you want to make
sure your children feel safe.

1232
01:16:32,088 --> 01:16:34,119
And it rules out telling a 10-year-old,

1233
01:16:34,143 --> 01:16:35,648
that the world is ended.

1234
01:16:38,202 --> 01:16:39,096
Cooper?

1235
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:44,880
How long for the engines CASE?

1236
01:16:44,904 --> 01:16:46,757
A minute or two.
But we don't have it.

1237
01:16:47,164 --> 01:16:48,534
Helmets on!

1238
01:16:52,066 --> 01:16:53,858
Brand co-pilot you are up.

1239
01:16:53,883 --> 01:16:56,604
CASE blow the cabin oxygen
through the main thrusters!

1240
01:16:56,758 --> 01:16:58,467
We are gonna spark it.
Roger that.

1241
01:16:58,698 --> 01:17:00,236
Locked.
Depressurizing.

1242
01:17:05,913 --> 01:17:07,163
Engines up!

1243
01:17:36,027 --> 01:17:36,941
Hello Rom.

1244
01:17:37,987 --> 01:17:39,316
I have waited years.

1245
01:17:40,740 --> 01:17:42,254
How? How many years?

1246
01:17:44,410 --> 01:17:45,774
By now it must be...

1247
01:17:45,798 --> 01:17:47,251
Twenty-three years...

1248
01:17:47,538 --> 01:17:49,071
four months eight days.

1249
01:17:53,669 --> 01:17:54,602
Doyle?

1250
01:18:01,052 --> 01:18:04,054
I thought I was prepared.
I knew the theory.

1251
01:18:05,431 --> 01:18:06,931
Reality is different.

1252
01:18:07,975 --> 01:18:08,994
And Miller?

1253
01:18:10,728 --> 01:18:12,166
There is nothing here for us.

1254
01:18:15,483 --> 01:18:16,983
Why didn't you sleep?

1255
01:18:17,943 --> 01:18:19,766
Oh I had a couple of stretches.

1256
01:18:20,624 --> 01:18:22,299
But I stopped believing
you were coming back.

1257
01:18:22,772 --> 01:18:25,054
And something seemed wrong
about dreaming my life away.

1258
01:18:26,213 --> 01:18:28,738
I learned what I could
from the black hole...

1259
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:31,684
but I could not send
anything to your father.

1260
01:18:32,208 --> 01:18:34,113
We have been receiving
but nothing gets out.

1261
01:18:34,642 --> 01:18:35,766
Is he alive?

1262
01:18:35,790 --> 01:18:36,726
Oh yeah.

1263
01:18:37,081 --> 01:18:38,674
Yeah?
Yeah.

1264
01:18:41,926 --> 01:18:44,433
We have got years of messages stored.

1265
01:18:45,221 --> 01:18:46,152
Cooper.

1266
01:18:46,555 --> 01:18:49,557
Messages span 23 years.

1267
01:18:51,656 --> 01:18:53,107
Play it from the beginning.

1268
01:18:56,315 --> 01:18:57,275
<i>Hey Dad.</i>

1269
01:18:58,859 --> 01:19:00,916
<i>Checking in. Saying hi.</i>

1270
01:19:04,203 --> 01:19:05,577
<i>Finished second in school.</i>

1271
01:19:07,550 --> 01:19:09,593
<i>Miss Kurling is still giving me C's though.</i>

1272
01:19:10,121 --> 01:19:12,538
<i>Pulled me down but second is not bad.</i>

1273
01:19:14,125 --> 01:19:15,712
<i>Grandpa attended the ceremony.</i>

1274
01:19:20,959 --> 01:19:22,275
<i>I met another girl Dad.</i>

1275
01:19:23,008 --> 01:19:23,892
<i>I...</i>

1276
01:19:25,344 --> 01:19:27,025
<i>I really think this is the one.</i>

1277
01:19:28,639 --> 01:19:29,711
<i>Name is Lois.</i>

1278
01:19:29,836 --> 01:19:30,994
<i>That's her right there.</i>

1279
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:35,913
<i>Murphy stole Grandpa's car.</i>

1280
01:19:37,071 --> 01:19:38,136
<i>She crashed it.</i>

1281
01:19:38,308 --> 01:19:39,468
<i>She is ok though.</i>

1282
01:19:40,276 --> 01:19:41,359
<i>Hey Dad.</i>

1283
01:19:42,278 --> 01:19:43,468
<i>Look at this!</i>

1284
01:19:44,447 --> 01:19:45,769
<i>You are a grandpa.</i>

1285
01:19:47,389 --> 01:19:48,769
<i>His name is Jesse.</i>

1286
01:19:49,702 --> 01:19:52,609
<i>I kind of wanted to call him Coop
but Lois says...</i>

1287
01:19:53,434 --> 01:19:54,605
<i>maybe next time.</i>

1288
01:19:55,104 --> 01:19:57,627
<i>Donald says he is already
earned the great part so...</i>

1289
01:19:57,802 --> 01:19:59,252
<i>we just leave it at that.</i>

1290
01:20:02,548 --> 01:20:04,340
<i>Oh dear. Oh dear.</i>

1291
01:20:05,134 --> 01:20:06,759
Say Bye-bye Grandpa.

1292
01:20:07,136 --> 01:20:09,152
<i>Bye-bye Grandpa. Ok.</i>

1293
01:20:09,388 --> 01:20:10,902
<i>Sorry it's been a while.</i>

1294
01:20:13,267 --> 01:20:14,191
<i>Just...</i>

1295
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:18,096
<i>what with Jesse and all.</i>

1296
01:20:25,029 --> 01:20:26,845
<i>Grandpa died last week.</i>

1297
01:20:27,781 --> 01:20:30,867
<i>We buried him out in the back
forty next to Mom and...</i>

1298
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:32,649
<i>Jesse.</i>

1299
01:20:33,891 --> 01:20:36,553
<i>Which is where we would have
buried you if you would ever...</i>

1300
01:20:37,706 --> 01:20:38,717
<i>come back.</i>

1301
01:20:40,544 --> 01:20:42,451
<i>Murph was there at the funeral.</i>

1302
01:20:43,422 --> 01:20:46,174
<i>We don't see her that much
but she came for that.</i>

1303
01:20:49,494 --> 01:20:51,627
<i>You are not listening to this I know that.</i>

1304
01:20:54,934 --> 01:20:57,085
<i>All these messages are just like...</i>

1305
01:20:58,854 --> 01:20:59,885
<i>drifting...</i>

1306
01:21:00,696 --> 01:21:02,391
<i>out there in the darkness.</i>

1307
01:21:03,609 --> 01:21:05,540
<i>Lois says that...</i>

1308
01:21:06,737 --> 01:21:07,768
<i>I have to...</i>

1309
01:21:08,143 --> 01:21:09,244
<i>let you go.</i>

1310
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:10,893
<i>And...</i>

1311
01:21:12,101 --> 01:21:12,885
<i>so...</i>

1312
01:21:16,617 --> 01:21:17,527
<i>I guess...</i>

1313
01:21:18,863 --> 01:21:19,902
<i>I am letting you go.</i>

1314
01:21:20,662 --> 01:21:22,809
<i>I don't know wherever you are Dad but...</i>

1315
01:21:23,779 --> 01:21:25,810
<i>I hope that you are at peace and...</i>

1316
01:21:28,432 --> 01:21:29,427
<i>Goodbye.</i>

1317
01:21:42,966 --> 01:21:44,044
<i>Hey Dad.</i>

1318
01:21:47,069 --> 01:21:48,236
Hey Murph.

1319
01:21:48,404 --> 01:21:49,935
<i>You son of a bitch.</i>

1320
01:21:54,366 --> 01:21:56,812
<i>I never made one of these when
you were still responding...</i>

1321
01:21:56,837 --> 01:21:58,702
<i>because I was so mad at you for leaving.</i>

1322
01:22:02,084 --> 01:22:03,973
<i>And then when you went quiet it...</i>

1323
01:22:06,922 --> 01:22:09,356
<i>seemed like I should live
with that decision. And I have.</i>

1324
01:22:14,138 --> 01:22:16,067
<i>But today is my birthday.</i>

1325
01:22:20,227 --> 01:22:22,958
<i>And it's a special one
because you told me...</i>

1326
01:22:27,620 --> 01:22:31,427
<i>You once told me that when you came
back we might be the same age.</i>

1327
01:22:33,675 --> 01:22:36,236
<i>And today I am the age
you were when you left.</i>

1328
01:22:39,436 --> 01:22:42,221
<i>So it would be a real good
time for you to come back.</i>

1329
01:22:56,221 --> 01:22:58,013
I didn't mean to intrude.

1330
01:22:58,438 --> 01:23:01,040
It's just that I have never
seen you in here before.

1331
01:23:01,143 --> 01:23:02,997
I have never been in here before.

1332
01:23:05,189 --> 01:23:06,511
I talk to Amelia,

1333
01:23:06,970 --> 01:23:08,191
all the time.

1334
01:23:08,692 --> 01:23:09,681
It helps.

1335
01:23:10,694 --> 01:23:12,058
I am glad you have started.

1336
01:23:12,082 --> 01:23:13,446
I have not.
I...

1337
01:23:13,723 --> 01:23:15,425
just had something I needed to get out.

1338
01:23:16,450 --> 01:23:17,939
I know they are still out there.

1339
01:23:17,963 --> 01:23:18,868
I know.

1340
01:23:19,036 --> 01:23:21,568
There are so many reasons
their communications,

1341
01:23:22,036 --> 01:23:23,465
might not be getting through.

1342
01:23:23,615 --> 01:23:24,832
I know professor.

1343
01:23:25,459 --> 01:23:26,489
I am not sure,

1344
01:23:27,348 --> 01:23:28,764
what I am more afraid of.

1345
01:23:29,546 --> 01:23:31,647
Them never coming back or...

1346
01:23:33,053 --> 01:23:34,039
coming back...

1347
01:23:34,873 --> 01:23:36,263
to find we have failed.

1348
01:23:36,470 --> 01:23:37,887
Then let's succeed.

1349
01:23:38,931 --> 01:23:39,582
So...

1350
01:23:40,683 --> 01:23:42,797
back, to the fourth iteration.

1351
01:23:42,821 --> 01:23:44,761
Let's run it through some new fields.

1352
01:23:44,941 --> 01:23:46,551
With respect professor,

1353
01:23:46,575 --> 01:23:48,238
we have tried that hundreds of times.

1354
01:23:48,441 --> 01:23:50,805
It only has to work once...

1355
01:23:51,391 --> 01:23:52,363
Murph.

1356
01:23:55,379 --> 01:23:57,646
Every rivet, that they strike,

1357
01:23:57,670 --> 01:23:58,966
could have been a bullet.

1358
01:23:59,363 --> 01:24:01,364
We have done well for the world here

1359
01:24:01,479 --> 01:24:04,110
whether or not, we crack the equation,

1360
01:24:04,321 --> 01:24:06,095
before I kick the bucket.

1361
01:24:06,625 --> 01:24:08,240
Don't be morbid professor.

1362
01:24:08,264 --> 01:24:09,702
I am not afraid of death.

1363
01:24:10,254 --> 01:24:11,504
I am an old physicist.

1364
01:24:13,340 --> 01:24:15,043
I am afraid of time.

1365
01:24:22,182 --> 01:24:23,142
Time.

1366
01:24:25,572 --> 01:24:27,095
You are afraid of time.

1367
01:24:29,648 --> 01:24:31,608
Figures we have been trying
to solve the equation

1368
01:24:31,617 --> 01:24:34,218
without changing the underlying
assumption about time.

1369
01:24:34,619 --> 01:24:36,328
And?
And that means...

1370
01:24:36,363 --> 01:24:38,186
each iteration is an attempt to...

1371
01:24:38,311 --> 01:24:40,264
prove its own proof.
It's...

1372
01:24:41,014 --> 01:24:43,044
recursive it's nonsensical.

1373
01:24:43,412 --> 01:24:45,360
Are you calling my life's work,

1374
01:24:45,461 --> 01:24:47,122
nonsense Murph?

1375
01:24:47,374 --> 01:24:49,138
No I am saying
that you have been trying to...

1376
01:24:49,163 --> 01:24:50,865
finish it with one arm, no with...

1377
01:24:50,889 --> 01:24:52,857
both arms tied behind your back.

1378
01:24:55,466 --> 01:24:57,182
And I don't understand why.

1379
01:24:58,427 --> 01:24:59,737
I am an old man Murph.

1380
01:25:01,180 --> 01:25:03,506
Can we take this point up at another time?

1381
01:25:03,974 --> 01:25:05,593
I want to talk to my daughter.

1382
01:25:08,270 --> 01:25:10,367
<i>Stepping out into the universe...</i>

1383
01:25:10,898 --> 01:25:12,762
<i>we must confront the reality</i>

1384
01:25:13,078 --> 01:25:14,958
<i>of interstellar travel.</i>

1385
01:25:15,611 --> 01:25:17,017
<i>We must reach,</i>

1386
01:25:17,216 --> 01:25:19,872
<i>far beyond our own lifespans.</i>

1387
01:25:20,324 --> 01:25:21,646
<i>We must think not,</i>

1388
01:25:21,817 --> 01:25:23,106
<i>as individuals,</i>

1389
01:25:23,755 --> 01:25:25,260
<i>but as a species.</i>

1390
01:25:28,290 --> 01:25:31,417
<i>Do not go gentle into that good night.</i>

1391
01:25:33,086 --> 01:25:34,534
TARS kept the Endurance,

1392
01:25:34,558 --> 01:25:35,813
right where we needed her.

1393
01:25:35,839 --> 01:25:38,274
But the trip took years
longer than we anticipated.

1394
01:25:38,967 --> 01:25:41,836
We no longer have the fuel
to visit both prospects so...

1395
01:25:42,805 --> 01:25:43,954
we have to choose.

1396
01:25:45,516 --> 01:25:46,412
But how?

1397
01:25:47,584 --> 01:25:48,841
They are both promising.

1398
01:25:50,809 --> 01:25:55,162
Edmunds' data is better but Dr. Mann
is the one still transmitting so...

1399
01:25:55,567 --> 01:25:58,112
We have no reason to suspect
Edmunds' data would have soured.

1400
01:25:59,597 --> 01:26:01,906
His world has key elements
to sustain human life.

1401
01:26:02,074 --> 01:26:03,479
As does Dr. Mann's.

1402
01:26:03,567 --> 01:26:04,909
Cooper this is my field.

1403
01:26:06,411 --> 01:26:07,453
And...

1404
01:26:08,555 --> 01:26:10,514
I really believe Edmunds'
is the better prospect.

1405
01:26:10,539 --> 01:26:11,028
Why?

1406
01:26:11,790 --> 01:26:13,445
Gargantua, that's why.

1407
01:26:15,045 --> 01:26:16,159
Look at Miller's planet.

1408
01:26:16,750 --> 01:26:18,610
Hydrocarbons organics yes...

1409
01:26:19,258 --> 01:26:20,288
but no life.

1410
01:26:20,655 --> 01:26:21,498
Sterile.

1411
01:26:22,508 --> 01:26:23,805
We will find the same thing on Mann's.

1412
01:26:24,096 --> 01:26:25,454
Because of the black hole?

1413
01:26:26,056 --> 01:26:27,003
Murphy's Law.

1414
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:28,841
Whatever can happen will happen.

1415
01:26:29,268 --> 01:26:31,745
Accident is the first
building block of evolution.

1416
01:26:31,770 --> 01:26:34,927
But when you are orbiting a black
hole not enough can happen.

1417
01:26:34,952 --> 01:26:37,072
It sucks in asteroids and comets,

1418
01:26:37,466 --> 01:26:39,247
other events which would
otherwise reach you.

1419
01:26:39,444 --> 01:26:40,941
We need to go further afield.

1420
01:26:41,905 --> 01:26:43,723
You once said that Dr. Mann...

1421
01:26:45,687 --> 01:26:47,043
was the best of us.

1422
01:26:47,348 --> 01:26:48,525
He is remarkable.

1423
01:26:48,926 --> 01:26:50,516
We are only here because of him.

1424
01:26:50,998 --> 01:26:52,551
And yet yet here he is.

1425
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:53,988
He is on the ground,

1426
01:26:54,660 --> 01:26:57,862
and he is sending a very unambiguous
message telling us...

1427
01:26:57,930 --> 01:26:59,639
to come to his planet.

1428
01:27:00,007 --> 01:27:01,579
Granted but...

1429
01:27:01,720 --> 01:27:02,956
Edmunds' data,

1430
01:27:03,361 --> 01:27:04,835
is more promising.

1431
01:27:05,095 --> 01:27:06,137
We should vote.

1432
01:27:06,305 --> 01:27:08,825
Well if we are going to vote
there is something you should know.

1433
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:10,341
Brand?

1434
01:27:11,082 --> 01:27:12,484
He has a right to know.

1435
01:27:13,195 --> 01:27:14,729
That has nothing to do with it.

1436
01:27:14,897 --> 01:27:15,760
What does?

1437
01:27:16,252 --> 01:27:17,913
She is in love with Wolf Edmunds.

1438
01:27:18,108 --> 01:27:18,972
Is that true?

1439
01:27:19,585 --> 01:27:20,358
Yes.

1440
01:27:23,822 --> 01:27:25,932
And that makes me want to follow my heart.

1441
01:27:29,995 --> 01:27:33,520
But maybe we have spent too long trying
to figure all this out with theory.

1442
01:27:33,637 --> 01:27:35,262
You are a scientist Brand.

1443
01:27:35,323 --> 01:27:36,504
So listen to me...

1444
01:27:37,691 --> 01:27:38,867
when I say that...

1445
01:27:39,031 --> 01:27:42,001
love isn't something we invented. It's...

1446
01:27:43,429 --> 01:27:45,173
observable powerful.

1447
01:27:47,930 --> 01:27:49,273
It has to mean something.

1448
01:27:49,465 --> 01:27:51,212
Love has meaning yes.

1449
01:27:51,236 --> 01:27:54,085
Social utility, social bonding,
child rearing.

1450
01:27:54,110 --> 01:27:55,550
We love people who have died.

1451
01:27:56,054 --> 01:27:57,812
Where is the social utility in that?

1452
01:27:58,598 --> 01:27:59,395
None.

1453
01:27:59,608 --> 01:28:02,895
Maybe it means something
more something we can't...

1454
01:28:03,481 --> 01:28:04,184
yet...

1455
01:28:04,567 --> 01:28:05,638
understand.

1456
01:28:05,730 --> 01:28:06,853
Maybe it's...

1457
01:28:07,419 --> 01:28:09,191
some evidence, some...

1458
01:28:10,285 --> 01:28:11,524
artifact of,

1459
01:28:11,548 --> 01:28:14,424
a higher dimension that
we can't consciously perceive.

1460
01:28:14,915 --> 01:28:15,570
I am...

1461
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:19,456
drawn across the universe to someone
I have not seen in a decade...

1462
01:28:19,878 --> 01:28:20,700
who I know...

1463
01:28:21,028 --> 01:28:22,271
is probably dead.

1464
01:28:22,962 --> 01:28:26,496
Love, is the one thing we are
capable of perceiving,

1465
01:28:26,521 --> 01:28:28,888
that transcends dimensions
of time and space.

1466
01:28:31,223 --> 01:28:34,846
Maybe we should trust that
even if we can't understand it yet.

1467
01:28:40,565 --> 01:28:41,696
Alright Cooper...

1468
01:28:44,111 --> 01:28:44,970
yes...

1469
01:28:46,571 --> 01:28:49,610
the tiniest possibility of seeing
Wolf again excites me.

1470
01:28:50,742 --> 01:28:51,990
That doesn't mean I am wrong.

1471
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:54,475
Honestly Amelia...

1472
01:28:57,082 --> 01:28:58,115
it might.

1473
01:29:05,048 --> 01:29:07,449
TARS chart a course for Dr. Mann's.

1474
01:29:24,651 --> 01:29:26,110
We will lose about a third again.

1475
01:29:26,278 --> 01:29:27,633
But next year...

1476
01:29:30,115 --> 01:29:32,950
Next year I am gonna work
Nelson's farm and we will make it up.

1477
01:29:33,785 --> 01:29:35,119
What happened to Nelson?

1478
01:29:41,543 --> 01:29:43,842
Murph have you eaten enough
or would you like some more soufflé?

1479
01:29:43,867 --> 01:29:44,522
Oh no.

1480
01:29:44,651 --> 01:29:46,613
I am full thanks.
It was delicious.

1481
01:29:48,002 --> 01:29:49,699
Coop finish your fritter please.

1482
01:29:52,345 --> 01:29:53,589
Will you spend the night?

1483
01:29:54,024 --> 01:29:55,718
Your room is exactly as you left it.

1484
01:29:55,742 --> 01:29:57,415
It's ready.
I need to get back.

1485
01:29:57,752 --> 01:29:59,642
My sewing machine
is in there but there is plenty...

1486
01:29:59,667 --> 01:30:01,110
I need to...

1487
01:30:04,649 --> 01:30:05,781
Too many memories.

1488
01:30:06,818 --> 01:30:08,141
We might have something for that.

1489
01:30:08,577 --> 01:30:09,539
Hey Coop.

1490
01:30:17,162 --> 01:30:18,107
The dust.

1491
01:30:20,957 --> 01:30:23,052
Lois, I have a friend who...

1492
01:30:24,033 --> 01:30:25,127
could look at his lungs.

1493
01:30:43,897 --> 01:30:46,272
Amelia I am sorry.
You were just being objective.

1494
01:30:46,358 --> 01:30:47,805
Unless you are punishing me,

1495
01:30:47,829 --> 01:30:49,647
for screwing up on Miller's planet.

1496
01:30:49,925 --> 01:30:52,464
No this was not a personal decision.
Well.

1497
01:30:53,215 --> 01:30:56,464
If you are wrong you will have
a very personal decision to make.

1498
01:30:57,082 --> 01:31:00,358
Your fuel calculations
are based on a return journey.

1499
01:31:00,744 --> 01:31:04,622
Strike out on Mann's planet and we will have
to decide whether to return home...

1500
01:31:04,751 --> 01:31:07,061
or push on to Edmunds' with Plan B.

1501
01:31:07,212 --> 01:31:08,618
Starting a colony,

1502
01:31:08,930 --> 01:31:10,881
could save us from extinction.

1503
01:31:11,524 --> 01:31:14,385
You might have to decide
between seeing your children again...

1504
01:31:14,748 --> 01:31:16,383
and the future of the human race.

1505
01:31:17,711 --> 01:31:19,213
I trust you will be as objective then.

1506
01:31:26,481 --> 01:31:28,399
He has been asking
for you since he came to.

1507
01:31:28,769 --> 01:31:30,140
We were trying to reach you.

1508
01:31:36,458 --> 01:31:37,398
Murph.

1509
01:31:38,201 --> 01:31:39,305
I am here professor.

1510
01:31:40,112 --> 01:31:42,320
I let you all down.

1511
01:31:42,932 --> 01:31:44,487
No you got us so far.

1512
01:31:44,987 --> 01:31:46,117
Real close.

1513
01:31:48,253 --> 01:31:49,711
I will finish what you started.

1514
01:31:50,213 --> 01:31:51,742
Good, good Murph.

1515
01:31:54,718 --> 01:31:56,508
You had faith...

1516
01:31:58,221 --> 01:31:59,513
all those...

1517
01:32:00,473 --> 01:32:01,599
all those years.

1518
01:32:03,786 --> 01:32:04,763
I...

1519
01:32:05,353 --> 01:32:07,855
I asked you to have faith.

1520
01:32:09,608 --> 01:32:11,601
I wanted you to believe...

1521
01:32:13,771 --> 01:32:15,170
that your father...

1522
01:32:18,783 --> 01:32:19,859
would come back.

1523
01:32:20,785 --> 01:32:22,177
I do professor.

1524
01:32:23,517 --> 01:32:25,018
Forgive me Murph.

1525
01:32:25,816 --> 01:32:27,633
There is nothing to forgive.

1526
01:32:30,824 --> 01:32:31,536
I...

1527
01:32:32,082 --> 01:32:33,521
I lied Murph.

1528
01:32:36,303 --> 01:32:37,669
I lied to you.

1529
01:32:44,507 --> 01:32:47,174
There was no need for him...

1530
01:32:49,022 --> 01:32:50,298
To come back.

1531
01:32:53,383 --> 01:32:54,265
There is...

1532
01:32:54,828 --> 01:32:56,672
no way to help us.

1533
01:32:58,027 --> 01:32:59,069
But Plan A...

1534
01:32:59,699 --> 01:33:00,605
All this.

1535
01:33:01,308 --> 01:33:02,808
All these people.

1536
01:33:03,883 --> 01:33:05,675
And the equation.

1537
01:33:09,751 --> 01:33:11,107
Did my father know?

1538
01:33:15,298 --> 01:33:16,607
Did he leave me?

1539
01:33:20,971 --> 01:33:21,940
Do...

1540
01:33:23,181 --> 01:33:24,268
not...

1541
01:33:25,475 --> 01:33:26,307
go...

1542
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:29,221
gentle...

1543
01:33:31,523 --> 01:33:32,352
No.

1544
01:33:34,210 --> 01:33:34,962
No!

1545
01:33:36,653 --> 01:33:38,040
You can't leave.

1546
01:33:38,595 --> 01:33:39,845
You... No.

1547
01:33:41,032 --> 01:33:43,920
Dr. Brand I am sorry to tell you
that your father died today.

1548
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:45,727
He had no pain.

1549
01:33:46,288 --> 01:33:47,420
He was at peace.

1550
01:33:48,498 --> 01:33:50,240
I am very sorry for your loss.

1551
01:34:03,305 --> 01:34:04,665
Brand did you know?

1552
01:34:07,392 --> 01:34:08,685
<i>He told you right?</i>

1553
01:34:11,938 --> 01:34:13,029
<i>You knew.</i>

1554
01:34:15,233 --> 01:34:16,572
<i>This was all a sham.</i>

1555
01:34:21,406 --> 01:34:22,775
<i>You left us here.</i>

1556
01:34:25,243 --> 01:34:26,180
<i>To suffocate.</i>

1557
01:34:28,913 --> 01:34:29,883
<i>To starve.</i>

1558
01:34:57,609 --> 01:34:58,704
Frozen cloud.

1559
01:37:23,379 --> 01:37:24,244
It's ok.

1560
01:37:24,923 --> 01:37:25,947
It's ok.

1561
01:37:33,181 --> 01:37:34,078
It's ok.

1562
01:37:40,104 --> 01:37:41,525
Pray you never learn...

1563
01:37:43,274 --> 01:37:44,638
just how good it can be,

1564
01:37:44,716 --> 01:37:46,104
to see another face.

1565
01:37:55,036 --> 01:37:57,066
I had not a lot of hope to begin with but...

1566
01:37:57,705 --> 01:37:59,598
after so long I had none.

1567
01:38:01,499 --> 01:38:03,768
My supplies were completely exhausted.

1568
01:38:06,506 --> 01:38:09,697
The last time I went to sleep
I didn't even set a waking date.

1569
01:38:13,972 --> 01:38:16,289
You have literally
raised me from the dead.

1570
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:18,757
Lazarus.

1571
01:38:20,687 --> 01:38:21,801
What about the others?

1572
01:38:22,254 --> 01:38:23,794
I am afraid you are it sir.

1573
01:38:24,649 --> 01:38:25,554
So far...

1574
01:38:25,976 --> 01:38:26,934
surely.

1575
01:38:27,819 --> 01:38:29,558
No our present situation,

1576
01:38:29,582 --> 01:38:32,656
is that there is very little chance
of rescuing any others.

1577
01:38:36,411 --> 01:38:37,483
Dr. Mann.

1578
01:38:37,881 --> 01:38:38,994
Dr. Mann?

1579
01:38:39,497 --> 01:38:40,955
Tell us about your world.

1580
01:38:44,669 --> 01:38:46,288
Our world we hope.

1581
01:38:50,341 --> 01:38:51,705
Our world...

1582
01:38:51,729 --> 01:38:52,676
is cold...

1583
01:38:52,844 --> 01:38:53,841
stark...

1584
01:38:56,014 --> 01:38:57,513
but undeniably beautiful.

1585
01:39:00,101 --> 01:39:02,936
The days are 67 hours long, cold.

1586
01:39:07,758 --> 01:39:08,866
The nights are...

1587
01:39:09,277 --> 01:39:11,040
67 far colder hours.

1588
01:39:17,452 --> 01:39:18,732
The gravity is a very,

1589
01:39:19,071 --> 01:39:21,611
very pleasant 80 percent of the Earth's.

1590
01:39:21,956 --> 01:39:23,863
Now up here where I landed
the water is...

1591
01:39:24,197 --> 01:39:25,118
alkali...

1592
01:39:25,316 --> 01:39:27,189
and the air has too much ammonia in it

1593
01:39:27,214 --> 01:39:28,995
to breathe for more
than just a few minutes but...

1594
01:39:29,127 --> 01:39:30,452
down at the surface,

1595
01:39:31,456 --> 01:39:33,456
and there is a surface...

1596
01:39:33,868 --> 01:39:35,024
the chlorine dissipates.

1597
01:39:35,762 --> 01:39:37,960
The ammonia gives way to crystalline
hydrocarbons,

1598
01:39:37,985 --> 01:39:39,446
and breathable air.

1599
01:39:39,817 --> 01:39:41,118
To organics.

1600
01:39:41,809 --> 01:39:43,805
Possibly even to life.

1601
01:39:44,979 --> 01:39:46,498
We might be sharing this world.

1602
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:49,193
These readings are from the surface?

1603
01:39:49,218 --> 01:39:50,180
Over the years,

1604
01:39:50,539 --> 01:39:52,631
I have dropped various probes.

1605
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:54,252
How far have you explored?

1606
01:39:54,724 --> 01:39:56,514
I have mounted several major expeditions.

1607
01:39:56,601 --> 01:40:00,190
But with oxygen in limited supply KIPP
there really did most of the legwork.

1608
01:40:00,779 --> 01:40:02,234
What went wrong with him sir?

1609
01:40:02,258 --> 01:40:03,401
Degeneration.

1610
01:40:03,706 --> 01:40:06,792
He misidentified the first organics
we found as ammonia crystals.

1611
01:40:07,460 --> 01:40:08,949
We struggled on for a time but...

1612
01:40:09,430 --> 01:40:11,414
ultimately I decommissioned him and...

1613
01:40:11,756 --> 01:40:13,821
used his power source
to keep the mission going.

1614
01:40:14,234 --> 01:40:16,436
I thought I was alone
before I shut him down.

1615
01:40:17,128 --> 01:40:18,537
Would you like me to look at him?

1616
01:40:19,328 --> 01:40:21,630
No. No. He needs a human touch.

1617
01:40:21,906 --> 01:40:25,857
Dr. Brand, CASE is relaying a message
for you from the comm station.

1618
01:40:26,437 --> 01:40:28,433
Ok. Be right there. Excuse me.

1619
01:40:41,011 --> 01:40:43,596
<i>Dr. Brand I am sorry to tell you
that your father died today.</i>

1620
01:40:44,205 --> 01:40:45,423
<i>He had no pain.</i>

1621
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:50,256
<i>He was at peace.</i>

1622
01:40:52,547 --> 01:40:53,998
<i>I am sorry for your loss.</i>

1623
01:40:56,930 --> 01:40:57,972
Is that Murph?

1624
01:40:58,401 --> 01:40:59,333
She is...

1625
01:41:00,073 --> 01:41:01,114
She is grown.

1626
01:41:01,139 --> 01:41:02,370
<i>Brand did you know?</i>

1627
01:41:03,891 --> 01:41:05,206
<i>He told you right?</i>

1628
01:41:08,604 --> 01:41:09,591
<i>You knew.</i>

1629
01:41:11,805 --> 01:41:13,306
<i>This was all a sham.</i>

1630
01:41:14,193 --> 01:41:15,536
<i>You left us here.</i>

1631
01:41:17,989 --> 01:41:19,057
<i>To suffocate.</i>

1632
01:41:21,576 --> 01:41:22,775
<i>To starve.</i>

1633
01:41:26,289 --> 01:41:27,873
<i>Did my father know too?</i>

1634
01:41:30,460 --> 01:41:31,452
<i>Dad?</i>

1635
01:41:33,671 --> 01:41:35,273
<i>I just want to know...</i>

1636
01:41:36,924 --> 01:41:38,925
<i>if you left me here to die.</i>

1637
01:41:41,512 --> 01:41:43,294
<i>I just have to know.</i>

1638
01:41:49,020 --> 01:41:50,262
Cooper my...

1639
01:41:51,939 --> 01:41:53,598
My father dedicated...

1640
01:41:54,233 --> 01:41:55,514
his whole life,

1641
01:41:55,538 --> 01:41:56,682
to Plan A. I have...

1642
01:41:57,002 --> 01:41:59,070
no idea what she is talking about.

1643
01:42:00,948 --> 01:42:01,914
I do.

1644
01:42:07,294 --> 01:42:10,263
He never even hoped to get
the people off the Earth?

1645
01:42:11,125 --> 01:42:11,966
No.

1646
01:42:12,841 --> 01:42:13,537
But...

1647
01:42:16,380 --> 01:42:19,676
But he has been trying to solve
the gravity equation for 40 years.

1648
01:42:20,881 --> 01:42:24,192
Amelia your father solved
his equation before I even left.

1649
01:42:24,865 --> 01:42:26,592
Then why would not he use it?

1650
01:42:26,766 --> 01:42:29,965
The equation could not reconcile relativity
with quantum mechanics.

1651
01:42:30,109 --> 01:42:31,592
You need more.
More?

1652
01:42:31,616 --> 01:42:32,749
More what?

1653
01:42:32,980 --> 01:42:33,927
More data.

1654
01:42:34,094 --> 01:42:35,827
You need to see into a black hole.

1655
01:42:36,150 --> 01:42:38,571
The laws of nature prohibit
a naked singularity.

1656
01:42:38,666 --> 01:42:39,946
Romilly is that true?

1657
01:42:41,306 --> 01:42:44,907
If a black hole is an oyster then
the singularity is the pearl inside.

1658
01:42:45,076 --> 01:42:49,089
The gravity is so strong, it's always
hidden in darkness behind the horizon.

1659
01:42:50,975 --> 01:42:52,761
That's why we call it a black hole.

1660
01:42:53,084 --> 01:42:54,139
Ok but...

1661
01:42:55,064 --> 01:42:57,027
if we see beyond the horizon.

1662
01:42:57,431 --> 01:42:58,602
We can't Coop.

1663
01:42:58,888 --> 01:43:00,992
There are some things
that are not meant to be known.

1664
01:43:01,592 --> 01:43:03,467
Your father had to find another way,

1665
01:43:03,564 --> 01:43:05,875
to save the human race from extinction.

1666
01:43:05,900 --> 01:43:07,295
Plan B. A colony.

1667
01:43:07,579 --> 01:43:08,732
Why not tell people?

1668
01:43:10,858 --> 01:43:13,812
Why keep building those stations?
Because he knew how hard it would be

1669
01:43:13,820 --> 01:43:15,302
to get people to work together,

1670
01:43:15,466 --> 01:43:17,413
to save the species instead of themselves.

1671
01:43:18,419 --> 01:43:19,444
Or their children.

1672
01:43:19,610 --> 01:43:20,563
Bullshit.

1673
01:43:20,820 --> 01:43:23,613
You never would have come here unless
you believed you were gonna save them.

1674
01:43:23,899 --> 01:43:26,492
Evolution has yet to transcend
that simple barrier.

1675
01:43:26,517 --> 01:43:29,061
We can care deeply, selflessly

1676
01:43:29,204 --> 01:43:30,588
about those we know...

1677
01:43:30,802 --> 01:43:33,327
but that empathy rarely extends
beyond our line of sight.

1678
01:43:33,457 --> 01:43:34,757
But the lie.

1679
01:43:38,696 --> 01:43:40,374
That monstrous lie?

1680
01:43:41,969 --> 01:43:43,051
Unforgivable.

1681
01:43:43,593 --> 01:43:44,715
And he knew that.

1682
01:43:45,803 --> 01:43:48,043
He was prepared to destroy
his own humanity,

1683
01:43:48,895 --> 01:43:50,239
in order to save the species.

1684
01:43:50,240 --> 01:43:52,259
He made an incredible sacrifice.
No.

1685
01:43:54,145 --> 01:43:56,135
An incredible sacrifice is being made,

1686
01:43:56,385 --> 01:43:57,719
by the people on Earth,

1687
01:43:57,876 --> 01:43:59,142
who are gonna die!

1688
01:43:59,483 --> 01:44:01,283
Because in his fucking arrogance...

1689
01:44:02,069 --> 01:44:03,788
he declared their case hopeless.

1690
01:44:04,822 --> 01:44:05,999
I am sorry Cooper...

1691
01:44:06,866 --> 01:44:09,064
their case is hopeless.
No.

1692
01:44:09,866 --> 01:44:10,619
No.

1693
01:44:11,128 --> 01:44:12,444
We are the future.

1694
01:44:16,417 --> 01:44:17,762
Cooper what can I do?

1695
01:44:21,547 --> 01:44:22,762
Let me go home.

1696
01:44:23,966 --> 01:44:25,884
You are absolutely positive?

1697
01:44:26,510 --> 01:44:29,012
His solution was correct.
He would had it for years.

1698
01:44:29,680 --> 01:44:30,711
It's worthless?

1699
01:44:30,984 --> 01:44:32,338
It's half the answer.

1700
01:44:33,267 --> 01:44:33,881
Ok.

1701
01:44:34,696 --> 01:44:36,462
How do you find the other half?

1702
01:44:36,854 --> 01:44:38,521
Out there? A black hole.

1703
01:44:38,689 --> 01:44:40,262
But stuck down here on Earth?

1704
01:44:40,509 --> 01:44:41,110
Yeah?

1705
01:44:42,860 --> 01:44:44,237
I am not sure you can.

1706
01:44:46,447 --> 01:44:48,768
God they just pack up and leave.

1707
01:44:50,534 --> 01:44:52,253
What are they hoping to find?

1708
01:44:53,204 --> 01:44:54,245
Survival.

1709
01:45:01,846 --> 01:45:02,831
Damn it.

1710
01:45:06,050 --> 01:45:06,788
Murph...

1711
01:45:07,235 --> 01:45:07,956
don't...

1712
01:45:08,649 --> 01:45:10,039
Don't people have a right to know?

1713
01:45:10,532 --> 01:45:11,915
Panic won't help.

1714
01:45:12,250 --> 01:45:14,484
We just have to keep
working same as ever.

1715
01:45:14,725 --> 01:45:15,547
Yeah but...

1716
01:45:15,921 --> 01:45:17,961
isn't that exactly what Professor Brand
was manipulating us to do?

1717
01:45:18,029 --> 01:45:19,259
Brand gave up on us.

1718
01:45:19,470 --> 01:45:21,015
I am still trying to solve this.

1719
01:45:22,108 --> 01:45:22,847
So...

1720
01:45:24,665 --> 01:45:25,932
do you have an idea?

1721
01:45:26,988 --> 01:45:27,940
A feeling.

1722
01:45:31,542 --> 01:45:32,977
I told you about my ghost.

1723
01:45:35,746 --> 01:45:37,555
My dad thought I called it a ghost...

1724
01:45:38,049 --> 01:45:39,453
because I was scared of it.

1725
01:45:43,379 --> 01:45:44,811
But I was never scared of it.

1726
01:45:46,806 --> 01:45:48,991
I called it a ghost because it felt...

1727
01:45:52,013 --> 01:45:53,380
It felt like a person.

1728
01:45:56,502 --> 01:45:58,169
It was trying to tell me something.

1729
01:46:00,862 --> 01:46:02,476
If there is an answer here on Earth,

1730
01:46:02,500 --> 01:46:03,777
it's back there...

1731
01:46:04,182 --> 01:46:05,759
somehow in that room.

1732
01:46:06,777 --> 01:46:08,063
So I have to find it.

1733
01:46:11,949 --> 01:46:13,345
We are running out of time.

1734
01:46:15,619 --> 01:46:17,620
What about auxiliary oxygen scrubbers?

1735
01:46:17,788 --> 01:46:18,860
No they can stay CASE.

1736
01:46:18,884 --> 01:46:20,779
I will be sleeping most of the way anyway.
Hey Coop?

1737
01:46:20,803 --> 01:46:21,569
Yeah?

1738
01:46:21,876 --> 01:46:23,983
I have a suggestion
for your return journey.

1739
01:46:24,045 --> 01:46:25,033
Yeah what's that?

1740
01:46:25,057 --> 01:46:26,896
Have one last crack at the black hole.

1741
01:46:28,674 --> 01:46:29,844
I am going home Rom.

1742
01:46:29,930 --> 01:46:30,891
Yeah I know.

1743
01:46:31,414 --> 01:46:33,375
This isn't going to cost you any time.

1744
01:46:34,702 --> 01:46:36,282
There is a chance for the people on Earth.

1745
01:46:36,930 --> 01:46:39,679
Talk to me.
Gargantua is an older spinning black hole.

1746
01:46:40,227 --> 01:46:41,258
It's what we call a...

1747
01:46:41,445 --> 01:46:42,968
a gentle singularity.

1748
01:46:43,226 --> 01:46:44,148
Gentle?

1749
01:46:44,173 --> 01:46:45,470
They are hardly gentle.

1750
01:46:45,494 --> 01:46:47,449
But the tidal gravity is so quick that...

1751
01:46:47,702 --> 01:46:49,682
something crossing the horizon fast,

1752
01:46:49,863 --> 01:46:50,934
might survive.

1753
01:46:51,308 --> 01:46:52,355
A probe say.

1754
01:46:52,440 --> 01:46:53,812
What happens after it crosses?

1755
01:46:53,836 --> 01:46:57,110
After the horizon is a complete mystery.

1756
01:46:57,304 --> 01:46:58,150
So...

1757
01:46:58,174 --> 01:47:00,389
what's to say there isn't
some way that the probe

1758
01:47:00,414 --> 01:47:03,010
can glimpse the singularity
and relay the quantum data?

1759
01:47:03,501 --> 01:47:06,854
If he is equipped to transmit
every form of energy that can pulse.

1760
01:47:06,922 --> 01:47:09,789
Just when did this probe
become a he professor?

1761
01:47:10,343 --> 01:47:12,094
TARS is the obvious candidate.

1762
01:47:12,843 --> 01:47:14,761
I have already told him what to look for.

1763
01:47:14,929 --> 01:47:17,491
I will need the old optical
transmitter off KIPP Cooper.

1764
01:47:17,807 --> 01:47:19,140
You would do this for us?

1765
01:47:19,308 --> 01:47:21,780
Before you get all teary try to remember
that as a robot,

1766
01:47:21,804 --> 01:47:23,284
I have to do anything you say.

1767
01:47:24,146 --> 01:47:25,518
Your cue light is broken.

1768
01:47:25,673 --> 01:47:26,776
I am not joking.

1769
01:47:29,944 --> 01:47:33,196
I will need TARS to remove and adapt
some components from KIPP.

1770
01:47:33,364 --> 01:47:35,865
I don't want to disturb
his archival functions.

1771
01:47:35,890 --> 01:47:37,091
I will supervise.

1772
01:47:37,701 --> 01:47:38,559
Alright.

1773
01:47:38,911 --> 01:47:41,026
Dr. Mann we need to find
three secure sites.

1774
01:47:41,676 --> 01:47:44,059
One for Brand's lab, two for habitat.

1775
01:47:44,084 --> 01:47:46,352
Once those modules have landed
you don't want to move them.

1776
01:47:46,377 --> 01:47:48,826
Well I can take you to the probe sites
but I don't think this...

1777
01:47:49,231 --> 01:47:51,576
these conditions are gonna hold.
I think we should wait.

1778
01:47:51,966 --> 01:47:54,801
CASE is headed back down with the rest
of the distillery equipment.

1779
01:47:54,969 --> 01:47:57,558
I would really like to secure
those sites by nightfall.

1780
01:47:59,723 --> 01:48:00,378
Well...

1781
01:48:01,144 --> 01:48:02,941
these squalls do usually blow over.

1782
01:48:03,227 --> 01:48:04,126
Ok then.

1783
01:48:04,520 --> 01:48:06,840
But you are gonna need a long range transmitter.
Got it.

1784
01:48:06,897 --> 01:48:08,204
Are you charged?
Yeah.

1785
01:48:08,883 --> 01:48:09,925
Follow me.

1786
01:48:10,688 --> 01:48:11,431
TARS.

1787
01:48:11,860 --> 01:48:13,170
72 hours yeah?

1788
01:48:13,195 --> 01:48:14,404
Roger that Cooper.

1789
01:48:20,703 --> 01:48:23,295
Brand told me why you feel
you have to go back.

1790
01:48:25,383 --> 01:48:27,864
But I would be remiss if I didn't
at least mention that...

1791
01:48:28,504 --> 01:48:30,867
a mission such as ours could certainly use...

1792
01:48:31,304 --> 01:48:32,664
an extra engineer.

1793
01:48:34,419 --> 01:48:36,260
You better slow down Turbo.

1794
01:48:37,170 --> 01:48:39,272
Safety first CASE remember.

1795
01:48:39,355 --> 01:48:40,928
Safety first Cooper.

1796
01:48:42,558 --> 01:48:45,560
I have to tell you Dr. Mann
I am honored to be a part of this.

1797
01:48:45,736 --> 01:48:47,509
But once we set up base camp,

1798
01:48:48,194 --> 01:48:49,302
and secure those modules,

1799
01:48:49,326 --> 01:48:50,740
my work is done here.

1800
01:48:51,358 --> 01:48:52,311
I am going home.

1801
01:49:00,701 --> 01:49:02,065
You have attachments.

1802
01:49:02,614 --> 01:49:04,302
But even without a family I can...

1803
01:49:04,622 --> 01:49:05,652
promise you that...

1804
01:49:05,934 --> 01:49:08,028
that yearning to be with other people...

1805
01:49:08,286 --> 01:49:09,341
is powerful.

1806
01:49:09,752 --> 01:49:10,782
That emotion is...

1807
01:49:11,559 --> 01:49:13,087
at the foundation...

1808
01:49:13,756 --> 01:49:15,245
of what makes us human.

1809
01:49:15,269 --> 01:49:16,799
It's not to be taken lightly.

1810
01:49:24,808 --> 01:49:26,423
How long have you had that cough?

1811
01:49:26,447 --> 01:49:27,496
A while.

1812
01:49:37,947 --> 01:49:39,501
Mom lets me play in here.

1813
01:49:41,484 --> 01:49:42,734
I don't touch your stuff.

1814
01:50:14,024 --> 01:50:15,408
Just take this gently.

1815
01:50:20,781 --> 01:50:24,158
You know why we could not just send machines
on these missions don't you Cooper?

1816
01:50:24,785 --> 01:50:26,816
A machine doesn't improvise well,

1817
01:50:26,840 --> 01:50:29,121
because you can't program a fear of death.

1818
01:50:30,434 --> 01:50:32,768
Our survival instinct is our single greatest...

1819
01:50:32,793 --> 01:50:34,115
source of inspiration.

1820
01:50:34,606 --> 01:50:36,020
Take you for example.

1821
01:50:37,047 --> 01:50:38,199
A father...

1822
01:50:39,006 --> 01:50:40,413
with a survival instinct,

1823
01:50:40,703 --> 01:50:42,274
that extends to your kids.

1824
01:50:43,053 --> 01:50:44,459
What does research tell us,

1825
01:50:44,873 --> 01:50:47,376
is the last thing you are going
to see before you die?

1826
01:50:49,435 --> 01:50:50,382
Your children.

1827
01:50:51,311 --> 01:50:52,350
Their faces.

1828
01:50:52,530 --> 01:50:53,788
At the moment of death

1829
01:50:53,861 --> 01:50:56,101
your mind is gonna push
a little bit harder to survive.

1830
01:50:57,401 --> 01:50:58,350
For them.

1831
01:50:59,320 --> 01:51:00,226
Deep breath.

1832
01:51:02,865 --> 01:51:04,377
Hey. I bet you are Coop.

1833
01:51:04,402 --> 01:51:06,491
Why don't you have a seat here for me?

1834
01:51:06,910 --> 01:51:08,878
It's bad. They cannot stay here.

1835
01:51:09,955 --> 01:51:11,247
Ok?
Yeah.

1836
01:51:19,590 --> 01:51:21,049
TARS what's taking so long?

1837
01:51:21,074 --> 01:51:23,771
Professor I am having
trouble completing the boot up.

1838
01:51:24,104 --> 01:51:25,341
I don't understand.

1839
01:51:32,603 --> 01:51:33,621
It's funny.

1840
01:51:35,939 --> 01:51:37,165
When I left Earth...

1841
01:51:38,567 --> 01:51:40,321
I thought I was prepared to die.

1842
01:51:42,696 --> 01:51:43,829
The truth is...

1843
01:51:46,241 --> 01:51:47,355
I never really...

1844
01:51:47,753 --> 01:51:50,756
considered the possibility
that my planet was not the one.

1845
01:51:53,957 --> 01:51:55,957
Nothing worked out the way
it was supposed to.

1846
01:51:56,283 --> 01:51:57,110
Let's go.

1847
01:52:05,969 --> 01:52:08,662
Alright hey buddy why don't you
give me a big deep breath.

1848
01:52:13,560 --> 01:52:14,793
What is this?

1849
01:52:15,396 --> 01:52:17,135
What are you doing?
I am sorry!

1850
01:52:17,385 --> 01:52:19,199
I can't let you leave with that ship.

1851
01:52:19,276 --> 01:52:20,430
We are gonna need it

1852
01:52:20,556 --> 01:52:21,855
to complete the mission...

1853
01:52:22,102 --> 01:52:23,183
once the others,

1854
01:52:23,371 --> 01:52:25,685
realize what this place isn't.

1855
01:52:25,948 --> 01:52:27,312
We cannot survive here.

1856
01:52:27,516 --> 01:52:28,681
I am sorry!

1857
01:52:29,159 --> 01:52:30,201
I am sorry!

1858
01:52:39,962 --> 01:52:41,247
They can't stay here anymore.

1859
01:52:41,271 --> 01:52:42,928
You have to leave right now.

1860
01:52:42,986 --> 01:52:45,080
Ok let me let me make something
abundantly clear.

1861
01:52:45,104 --> 01:52:46,462
You have a responsibility...

1862
01:52:46,487 --> 01:52:47,857
Oh! Jesus!

1863
01:52:48,069 --> 01:52:49,697
Coop get her stuff. She is going home.

1864
01:52:50,533 --> 01:52:52,450
Dad didn't raise you to be this dumb Tom!

1865
01:52:52,516 --> 01:52:54,223
Dad didn't raise me, Grandpa did.

1866
01:52:54,248 --> 01:52:56,391
And he is buried out back
with Mom and Jesse.

1867
01:52:57,187 --> 01:52:59,345
You faked, all the data?

1868
01:53:01,293 --> 01:53:02,236
Yes.

1869
01:53:06,655 --> 01:53:07,963
There is no surface?

1870
01:53:08,150 --> 01:53:09,119
No.

1871
01:53:10,659 --> 01:53:12,367
I tried to do my duty Cooper...

1872
01:53:12,628 --> 01:53:13,525
but I knew...

1873
01:53:14,289 --> 01:53:15,812
the day that I arrived here that...

1874
01:53:16,296 --> 01:53:17,852
this place had nothing.

1875
01:53:18,349 --> 01:53:19,572
And I resisted,

1876
01:53:20,033 --> 01:53:21,882
the temptation for years...

1877
01:53:22,880 --> 01:53:23,618
but...

1878
01:53:23,952 --> 01:53:25,075
I knew that...

1879
01:53:25,299 --> 01:53:26,496
if I just pressed that...

1880
01:53:27,059 --> 01:53:28,134
button then...

1881
01:53:28,505 --> 01:53:30,088
somebody would come and save me.

1882
01:53:31,472 --> 01:53:33,111
You fucking coward.

1883
01:53:33,947 --> 01:53:34,849
Yes.

1884
01:53:39,999 --> 01:53:40,824
Yes.

1885
01:53:43,045 --> 01:53:43,894
Yes.

1886
01:53:45,427 --> 01:53:46,118
Yes.

1887
01:53:58,081 --> 01:54:00,823
Listen if you are not going to go
let your family go.

1888
01:54:00,847 --> 01:54:02,651
Just let save your family.

1889
01:54:03,128 --> 01:54:04,576
And go live underground...

1890
01:54:04,875 --> 01:54:05,696
with you?

1891
01:54:05,721 --> 01:54:07,549
Pray that Daddy comes to save us?

1892
01:54:07,574 --> 01:54:08,788
Dad's not coming back.

1893
01:54:08,812 --> 01:54:10,248
He never was coming back.

1894
01:54:10,646 --> 01:54:11,751
It's up to me.

1895
01:54:11,776 --> 01:54:13,169
You are gonna save everybody?

1896
01:54:13,597 --> 01:54:16,432
Because Dad could not do it.
Dad didn't even try!

1897
01:54:16,600 --> 01:54:18,387
Dad just abandoned us!

1898
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:21,090
He left us here to die.

1899
01:54:22,217 --> 01:54:23,505
Nobody is going with you.

1900
01:54:27,464 --> 01:54:29,653
You gonna wait for your next kid to die?

1901
01:54:33,116 --> 01:54:34,153
Get out.

1902
01:54:35,285 --> 01:54:36,619
And don't come back.

1903
01:54:41,500 --> 01:54:42,989
You can keep my stuff.

1904
01:54:54,363 --> 01:54:55,300
Stop it!

1905
01:54:58,642 --> 01:55:00,226
No. No!

1906
01:55:01,311 --> 01:55:04,188
Dr. Mann there is a 50-50 chance
you are gonna kill yourself!

1907
01:55:05,155 --> 01:55:07,156
Those are the best odds I have had in years.

1908
01:55:27,462 --> 01:55:28,954
Don't judge me Cooper.

1909
01:55:30,048 --> 01:55:31,978
You were never tested like I was.

1910
01:55:32,926 --> 01:55:34,385
Few men have been.

1911
01:55:42,928 --> 01:55:44,094
You tried your best Murph.

1912
01:55:53,405 --> 01:55:54,780
You are feeling it are not you?

1913
01:55:56,450 --> 01:55:57,932
The survival instinct.

1914
01:55:59,202 --> 01:56:00,326
That's what drove me.

1915
01:56:00,351 --> 01:56:01,821
It's what drives all of us.

1916
01:56:01,846 --> 01:56:03,587
And it's what's gonna save us.

1917
01:56:04,708 --> 01:56:06,162
Because I want to save all of us.

1918
01:56:06,186 --> 01:56:07,632
For you Cooper.

1919
01:56:13,216 --> 01:56:14,311
I am sorry I can't...

1920
01:56:14,621 --> 01:56:16,749
I can't watch you go through this.
I am sorry.

1921
01:56:17,095 --> 01:56:18,084
I thought I could,

1922
01:56:18,498 --> 01:56:19,602
but I can't.

1923
01:56:20,849 --> 01:56:23,017
I am here. I am here for you.

1924
01:56:23,232 --> 01:56:24,868
<i>Just listen to my voice Cooper.</i>

1925
01:56:26,146 --> 01:56:27,221
I am right here.

1926
01:56:29,216 --> 01:56:30,550
You are not alone.

1927
01:56:40,469 --> 01:56:41,969
Do you see your children?

1928
01:56:45,123 --> 01:56:46,266
It's ok.

1929
01:56:47,417 --> 01:56:48,740
They are right there with you.

1930
01:56:53,048 --> 01:56:55,633
Did Professor Brand tell you
that poem before you left?

1931
01:56:56,468 --> 01:56:57,639
<i>Do you remember?</i>

1932
01:57:00,347 --> 01:57:01,461
<i>Do not go gentle...</i>

1933
01:57:01,867 --> 01:57:03,308
<i>into that good night,</i>

1934
01:57:04,935 --> 01:57:05,798
<i>Old age</i>

<i>and rave at close of day;</i>

1937
01:57:11,066 --> 01:57:11,888
<i>Rage,</i>

1938
01:57:12,232 --> 01:57:13,962
<i>rage against the dying of the light.</i>

1939
01:57:38,093 --> 01:57:39,760
Brand! Help!

1940
01:57:39,928 --> 01:57:41,887
<i>Help! Help! Help..</i>
Cooper?

1941
01:57:48,603 --> 01:57:49,399
CASE!

1942
01:57:50,188 --> 01:57:51,282
No air.

1943
01:57:52,315 --> 01:57:53,258
Ammonia.

1944
01:57:54,509 --> 01:57:56,182
Cooper. Cooper we are coming!

1945
01:57:56,449 --> 01:57:57,254
CASE!

1946
01:57:57,279 --> 01:57:59,196
I have a fix.
Go! Go go go!

1947
01:57:59,389 --> 01:58:00,990
And away!

1948
01:58:13,127 --> 01:58:15,336
Cooper we are coming.
Hang in there. Don't talk.

1949
01:58:15,402 --> 01:58:18,049
Try to breathe as little as possible.
We are almost there.

1950
01:58:21,444 --> 01:58:23,245
There is a security lockout sir.

1951
01:58:23,313 --> 01:58:26,450
It requires a person to access function.

1952
01:58:31,913 --> 01:58:33,186
It's all yours sir.

1953
01:58:41,531 --> 01:58:42,990
<i>Try not to breathe.</i>

1954

I see him. I see him. I see him!

1960

I am here!

1963
01:59:52,164 --> 01:59:54,165
This data makes no sense.

1964

I am sorry.

1965
02:00:04,114 --> 02:00:06,821
What?
Mann was lying!

1966
02:00:14,457 --> 02:00:15,913
Go. Go.

1967
02:00:17,335 --> 02:00:18,377
Romilly.

1968
02:00:18,753 --> 02:00:19,795
Romilly!

1969
02:00:20,130 --> 02:00:22,215
Romilly! Do you read me Romilly?

1970
02:00:22,573 --> 02:00:23,334
Romilly!

1971
02:00:23,359 --> 02:00:25,223
Step back professor! Step back!

1972
02:00:32,988 --> 02:00:33,798
<i>Romilly...</i>

02:00:41,151 --> 02:00:42,147
Lois?

1976
02:00:42,777 --> 02:00:45,579
What happened to caution CASE?
Safety first Cooper.

1977
02:00:46,656 --> 02:00:49,636
Romilly? Romilly do you read me?
This is Brand.

1978
02:00:52,954 --> 02:00:53,996
Romilly?

1979
02:00:54,164 --> 02:00:55,126
Dr. Brand.

1980
02:00:55,150 --> 02:00:56,749
Cooper.
There is been an explosion.

1981
02:00:57,375 --> 02:00:58,857
Dr. Mann's compound.

1982
02:01:26,780 --> 02:01:28,631
TARS. TARS 10 o'clock!

1983
02:01:35,205 --> 02:01:36,972
Let me know when TARS is aboard.

1984
02:01:40,794 --> 02:01:42,136
Romilly did not survive.

1985
02:01:43,880 --> 02:01:45,547
I could not save him.

1986
02:01:45,715 --> 02:01:47,457
TARS is in.
I will take her from here.

1987
02:01:47,485 --> 02:01:50,090
Do we have a fix on the Ranger?
He is pushing into orbit!

1988
02:01:50,387 --> 02:01:53,035
If he takes control of that ship we are dead.

1989
02:01:54,599 --> 02:01:55,755
He did maroon us?

1990
02:01:55,864 --> 02:01:57,755
No he is marooning us.

1991
02:01:59,562 --> 02:02:01,684
I will meet you guys downstairs.
Go wait by the car.

1992
02:02:09,906 --> 02:02:11,830
Come on! Give me your bag.

1993
02:02:12,131 --> 02:02:14,323
Get in the backseat.
Get in the backseat now!

1994
02:02:19,749 --> 02:02:21,667
<i>Dr. Mann, please respond.</i>

1995
02:02:22,293 --> 02:02:24,378
Dr. Mann, please respond!

1996
02:02:24,803 --> 02:02:26,755
He doesn't know
the Endurance docking procedure.

1997
02:02:26,923 --> 02:02:29,725
The autopilot does.
Not since TARS disabled it.

1998
02:02:31,116 --> 02:02:31,975
Nice.

1999
02:02:32,110 --> 02:02:34,743
<i>What's your trust setting TARS?</i>
Lower than yours apparently.

2000
02:02:38,393 --> 02:02:42,040
<i>Do not attempt docking.
I repeat. Do not attempt docking.</i>

2001
02:02:42,188 --> 02:02:43,118
<i>Please res...</i>

2002

Please resp...

2009
02:04:05,363 --> 02:04:06,184
Damm.

2010
02:04:44,269 --> 02:04:46,189
Moving slowly toward the Endurance.

2011
02:05:10,962 --> 02:05:12,546
<i>Imperfect contact.</i>

2012

<i>Hatch lockout.</i>

2013
02:05:22,557 --> 02:05:23,671
Is he locked on yet?

2014
02:05:23,843 --> 02:05:24,908
Imperfectly.

2015
02:05:27,029 --> 02:05:28,392
Dr. Mann. Do not...

2016
02:05:49,667 --> 02:05:52,095
<i>Hatch lockout disengaged.</i>

2017
02:06:01,221 --> 02:06:02,585
Dr. Mann do not...

2018
02:06:02,780 --> 02:06:05,064
I repeat. Do not open the hatch.

2019
02:06:05,348 --> 02:06:07,024
I repeat. Do not open the hatch.

2020
02:06:07,049 --> 02:06:09,611
If you open the hatch
the airlock will depressurize.

2021
02:06:35,838 --> 02:06:38,158
What happens if he blows the airlock?
Nothing good.

2022
02:06:44,178 --> 02:06:46,927
Ok pull back pull back! Retro thrusters
everything we have got CASE!

2023
02:06:46,952 --> 02:06:48,436
Thrusters are full!
Back!

2024
02:06:48,585 --> 02:06:50,786
CASE relay my transmission
to the on board computer

2025
02:06:50,853 --> 02:06:52,938
and have it rebroadcast as emergency P.A.

2026
02:06:53,406 --> 02:06:54,480
Dr. Mann...

2027
02:06:56,718 --> 02:06:58,648
<i>I repeat. Do not open the inner hatch.</i>

2028
02:06:59,082 --> 02:07:00,941
<i>I repeat. Do not open...</i>
Brand?

2029
02:07:01,656 --> 02:07:03,405
<i>I don't know what he said to you.</i>

2030
02:07:03,866 --> 02:07:05,935
But I am taking command of the Endurance.

2031
02:07:06,995 --> 02:07:09,165
<i>And then we can talk
about completing the mission.</i>

2032
02:07:12,319 --> 02:07:13,322
Dr. Mann.

2033
02:07:13,697 --> 02:07:14,579
I is ten to me.

2034
02:07:14,903 --> 02:07:16,395
This is not about my life.

2035
02:07:17,530 --> 02:07:18,702
Or Cooper's life.

2036
02:07:18,726 --> 02:07:20,254
This is about all mankind.

2037
02:07:21,467 --> 02:07:22,660
There is a moment...

2038
02:07:29,225 --> 02:07:30,435
It is not...

2039
02:07:39,160 --> 02:07:40,201
Oh my God.

2040
02:07:58,212 --> 02:08:02,243
Cooper, there is no point using your fuel to chase...
Analyze the Endurance's spin.

2041
02:08:07,430 --> 02:08:09,370
Cooper what are you doing?
Docking.

2042
02:08:14,228 --> 02:08:17,064
Endurance rotation is 6768 RPM.

2043
02:08:17,131 --> 02:08:19,591
Ok get ready to match our spin
with the retro thrusters.

2044
02:08:19,859 --> 02:08:21,540
It's not possible.
No...

2045
02:08:22,111 --> 02:08:23,278
it's necessary.

2046
02:08:34,916 --> 02:08:36,725
Endurance is hitting stratosphere!

2047
02:08:41,130 --> 02:08:42,706
She is got no heat shield.

2048
02:08:46,302 --> 02:08:47,925
CASE you ready?
Ready.

2049
02:08:56,379 --> 02:08:57,176
Cooper!

2050
02:08:57,457 --> 02:08:59,235
This is no time for caution.

2051
02:09:01,192 --> 02:09:03,170
CASE if I black out you take the stick.

2052
02:09:03,820 --> 02:09:06,342
TARS get ready to engage
the docking mechanism.

2053
02:09:13,229 --> 02:09:14,730
Endurance is starting to heat.

2054
02:09:14,997 --> 02:09:16,331
Twenty feet out.

2055
02:09:16,499 --> 02:09:19,000
<i>I need three degrees starboard Cooper.</i>

2056
02:09:19,168 --> 02:09:20,428
Ten feet out.

2057
02:09:21,237 --> 02:09:22,791
<i>Cooper we are lined up.</i>

2058
02:09:23,369 --> 02:09:25,299
<i>Lined up.</i>
Initiating spin!

2059
02:10:07,275 --> 02:10:08,483
Come on TARS.

2060
02:10:16,642 --> 02:10:17,896
Come on TARS!

2061
02:10:29,305 --> 02:10:31,723
We are locked Cooper.
Locked. Easing up!

2062
02:10:39,607 --> 02:10:40,531
Easy.

2063
02:10:42,210 --> 02:10:43,543
Easy.

2064
02:10:49,183 --> 02:10:50,493
Retro thrusters!

2065
02:10:58,751 --> 02:11:00,021
Main engines on.

2066
02:11:06,008 --> 02:11:07,389
Pushing out of orbit.

2067
02:11:07,733 --> 02:11:09,038
Come on baby.

2068
02:11:16,827 --> 02:11:18,050
Killing main engines!

2069
02:11:19,747 --> 02:11:21,120
Ok we are out of orbit.

2070
02:11:28,756 --> 02:11:29,411
Ok.

2071
02:11:30,037 --> 02:11:31,949
And for our next trick!

2072
02:11:33,304 --> 02:11:34,583
It will have to be good.

2073
02:11:35,106 --> 02:11:36,876
We are heading into Gargantua's pull.

2074
02:11:38,124 --> 02:11:39,166
Oh shit.

2075
02:11:39,767 --> 02:11:41,672
CASE take the stick.
Roger that.

2076
02:12:31,427 --> 02:12:32,224
Cooper,

2077
02:12:32,513 --> 02:12:34,027
we are slipping towards Gargantua.

2078
02:12:35,097 --> 02:12:36,483
Shall I use main engines?

2079
02:12:37,254 --> 02:12:38,054
No.

2080
02:12:38,751 --> 02:12:40,780
We got to let her slide as far as we can.

2081
02:12:50,004 --> 02:12:50,913
Give it to me.

2082
02:12:51,148 --> 02:12:52,968
There is good news
there is bad news Cooper.

2083
02:12:53,049 --> 02:12:54,640
Yeah I have heard that one TARS.

2084
02:12:55,610 --> 02:12:56,851
Give it to me straight.

2085
02:13:05,419 --> 02:13:07,801
The backup generator kicked in so
the system is stable.

2086
02:13:07,825 --> 02:13:09,278
They are all good.
Good.

2087
02:13:10,258 --> 02:13:10,971
Ok.

2088
02:13:11,609 --> 02:13:13,898
The navigational hub has
been completely destroyed.

2089
02:13:14,004 --> 02:13:16,711
We don't have enough life support
to make it back to Earth but...

2090
02:13:16,989 --> 02:13:19,074
I think we can scratch our way
to Edmunds' planet.

2091
02:13:19,241 --> 02:13:20,575
What about fuel?

2092
02:13:20,893 --> 02:13:21,799
Not enough.

2093
02:13:22,415 --> 02:13:23,619
But I have a plan.

2094
02:13:24,026 --> 02:13:26,028
We let... Gargantua...

2095
02:13:26,221 --> 02:13:28,029
pull us down close to her horizon.

2096
02:13:28,512 --> 02:13:31,921
Then a powered slingshot around
launching us towards Edmunds' planet.

2097
02:13:31,946 --> 02:13:32,951
Manually?

2098
02:13:32,975 --> 02:13:34,447
That's what I am here for.

2099
02:13:34,489 --> 02:13:36,660
I am gonna take us just
inside the critical orbit.

2100
02:13:37,205 --> 02:13:38,404
What about the time slippage?

2101
02:13:38,699 --> 02:13:42,004
Neither one of us has time to worry
about relativity right now Dr. Brand.

2102
02:13:46,460 --> 02:13:47,653
I am sorry Cooper.

2103
02:13:50,990 --> 02:13:53,681
Once we have gathered
enough speed around Gargantua...

2104
02:13:54,777 --> 02:13:56,259
we use Lander 1...

2105
02:13:57,113 --> 02:13:59,506
and Ranger 2 as rocket boosters to...

2106
02:14:00,174 --> 02:14:02,175
push us out of the black hole's gravity.

2107
02:14:04,812 --> 02:14:07,069
<i>The Lander's linkages
have been destroyed...</i>

2108
02:14:07,748 --> 02:14:09,591
<i>so we will have to control manually.</i>

2109
02:14:11,293 --> 02:14:13,888
Once Lander 1 is spent TARS will detach...

2110
02:14:14,722 --> 02:14:16,431
And get sucked right into that black hole.

2111
02:14:17,258 --> 02:14:18,717
Why does TARS have to detach?

2112
02:14:18,785 --> 02:14:21,128
Well we have to shed the weight
to escape the gravity.

2113
02:14:21,495 --> 02:14:22,871
<i>Newton's third law.</i>

2114
02:14:23,139 --> 02:14:26,115
<i>The only way humans have ever
figured out of getting somewhere</i>

2115
02:14:26,140 --> 02:14:27,464
<i>is to leave something behind.</i>

2116
02:14:27,727 --> 02:14:28,590
Cooper,

2117
02:14:28,945 --> 02:14:30,523
you can't ask TARS to do this for us.

2118
02:14:30,775 --> 02:14:32,010
He is a robot.

2119
02:14:32,406 --> 02:14:34,484
So you don't have
to ask him to do anything.

2120
02:14:34,942 --> 02:14:36,234
<i>Cooper you asshole!</i>

2121
02:14:36,610 --> 02:14:38,235
Sorry you broke up a little bit there.

2122
02:14:38,863 --> 02:14:40,782
It's what we intended Dr. Brand.

2123
02:14:41,449 --> 02:14:44,032
It's our only chance
to save people on Earth.

2124
02:14:44,101 --> 02:14:47,412
<i>If I can find a way to transmit
the quantum data I will find in there</i>

2125
02:14:47,455 --> 02:14:49,187
<i>they might still make it.</i>

2126
02:14:50,332 --> 02:14:52,726
Let's just hope there is still
someone there to save.

2127
02:15:21,673 --> 02:15:23,468
<i>Maximum velocity achieved.</i>

2128
02:15:24,366 --> 02:15:26,382
Prepare to fire escape thrusters.

2129
02:15:27,036 --> 02:15:28,119
Ready?

2130
02:15:28,287 --> 02:15:29,210
Ready.

2131
02:15:29,872 --> 02:15:30,793
Ready.

2132
02:15:30,907 --> 02:15:32,699
Main engine ignition in Three.

2133
02:15:33,344 --> 02:15:34,223
Two.

2134
02:15:34,895 --> 02:15:35,856
One.

2135
02:15:36,214 --> 02:15:37,106
Mark.

2136
02:15:50,226 --> 02:15:51,476
Come on baby.

2137
02:15:52,645 --> 02:15:54,813
Lander 1 engines on my mark.

2138
02:15:55,147 --> 02:15:56,189
Three.

2139
02:15:56,607 --> 02:15:57,511
Two.

2140
02:15:57,900 --> 02:15:58,754
One.

2141
02:15:59,014 --> 02:15:59,847
Mark.

2142
02:16:04,740 --> 02:16:07,243
<i>Ranger 2 engines on my mark.</i>

Mark.
Fire!

2147
02:16:21,839 --> 02:16:25,008
This little maneuver
is gonna cost us 51 years!

2148
02:16:25,995 --> 02:16:28,497
You don't sound so bad for pushing 120!

2149
02:16:43,654 --> 02:16:44,619

02:16:52,927 --> 02:16:53,959
Detach!

2157
02:16:57,079 --> 02:16:58,156
Goodbye TARS.

2158
02:16:58,623 --> 02:16:59,717
Goodbye Dr. Brand.

2159
02:16:59,795 --> 02:17:01,201
See you on the other side Coop.

2160
02:17:01,279 --> 02:17:02,851
See you there Slick!

2161
02:17:11,307 --> 02:17:12,546
Ok CASE.

2162
02:17:13,556 --> 02:17:15,065
<i>Nice reckless flying!</i>

2163
02:17:15,571 --> 02:17:17,023

02:17:17,771 --> 02:17:18,760
Ranger 2.

2165
02:17:19,023 --> 02:17:20,499
Prepare to detach.
What?

2166
02:17:20,524 --> 02:17:21,805
No! No!

2167
02:17:21,829 --> 02:17:23,632
Cooper! What are you doing?

2168
02:17:23,848 --> 02:17:25,130
Newton's third law.

2169
02:17:25,679 --> 02:17:27,397
You got to leave something behind.

2170
02:17:27,681 --> 02:17:30,099
You told me we had
enough resources for both of us.

2171
02:17:30,124 --> 02:17:31,649
We agreed Amelia...

2172
02:17:32,394 --> 02:17:33,696
90 percent.

2173
02:17:35,831 --> 02:17:36,774
Don't.

2174
02:17:39,026 --> 02:17:40,030
Detach.

2175
02:17:53,290 --> 02:17:54,171
Ok.

2176
02:17:54,413 --> 02:17:55,887
I am nosing down.

2177
02:17:59,939 --> 02:18:01,650
Approaching the event horizon.

2178
02:18:04,093 --> 02:18:06,344
Portside dipping down beneath it...

2179
02:18:07,029 --> 02:18:08,267

<i>I have a visual of the event.</i>

2183
02:18:15,955 --> 02:18:16,952
It's all black.

2184
02:18:19,551 --> 02:18:20,817
TARS do you read me?

2185
02:18:21,257 --> 02:18:22,465
It's all blackness.

2186
02:18:24,964 --> 02:18:27,165
TARS! Do you read me? Over.

2187
02:18:31,704 --> 02:18:32,647
Ok.

2188
02:18:33,981 --> 02:18:35,108
Screen is...

2189
02:18:36,859 --> 02:18:38,359
getting interference.

2190
02:18:40,170 --> 02:18:42,293
Losing control of the stick.
I got flashes.

2191
02:18:43,440 --> 02:18:45,177
Flashes of lightness and blackness.

2192
02:18:46,819 --> 02:18:48,266
The turbulence in the gravity,

2193
02:18:48,547 --> 02:18:49,677
is increasing.

2194
02:18:55,895 --> 02:18:57,330
The computers are going down.

2195
02:19:09,925 --> 02:19:12,285
Gravitational pull.
I am losing control of the stick.

02:26:51,037 --> 02:26:51,787

<i>Roger that.</i>

02:26:55,223 --> 02:26:56,389

02:26:56,637 --> 02:26:57,698
<i>Somewhere...</i>

<i>in their fifth dimension.</i>

02:27:00,666 --> 02:27:02,353
<i>They saved us.</i>

2255
02:27:03,106 --> 02:27:03,886
Yeah?

2256
02:27:04,345 --> 02:27:05,719
Who the hell is they?

2257
02:27:06,330 --> 02:27:08,275
And just why would they want to help us?

2258
02:27:08,422 --> 02:27:11,611
<i>I don't know, but they constructed
this three-dimensional space...</i>

2259
02:27:11,636 --> 02:27:13,563
<i>inside their five-dimensional reality</i>

2260

<i>to allow you to understand it.</i>

Yeah that ain't working.

2262
02:27:16,953 --> 02:27:18,126
<i>Yes it is.</i>

2263
02:27:18,663 --> 02:27:21,962
<i>You have seen that time is represented
here as a physical dimension.</i>

2264
02:27:22,709 --> 02:27:25,892
<i>You have worked out that you can
exert a force across space-time.</i>

2265
02:27:26,213 --> 02:27:27,160
Gravity,

2266
02:27:28,392 --> 02:27:29,581

2267
02:27:29,906 --> 02:27:30,963
<i>Affirmative.</i>

Gravity

2269
02:27:36,160 --> 02:27:37,795
can cross the dimensions...

2270
02:27:38,105 --> 02:27:39,366
including time.

2271
02:27:39,742 --> 02:27:40,808
<i>Apparently.</i>

2272
02:27:44,975 --> 02:27:46,782
Do you have the quantum data?

2273
02:27:47,192 --> 02:27:48,548
<i>Roger. I have it.</i>

2274

<i>I am transmitting it on all wavelengths

I can do this. I can do this.

2276
02:27:56,660 --> 02:27:59,411
<i>But such complicated data to a child?</i>

2277
02:27:59,579 --> 02:28:00,704
Not just any child.

2278
02:28:00,872 --> 02:28:02,162
What else?

2279
02:28:02,791 --> 02:28:04,279
Oh, come on Dad.

2280
02:28:07,428 --> 02:28:09,396
Murph the fire is out! Come on!

2281
02:28:09,464 --> 02:28:10,912
<i>Even if you communicate it here,</i>

2282
02:28:10,936 --> 02:28:13,467
<i>she won't understand its significance for years.</i>

2283
02:28:14,261 --> 02:28:15,719
I get that TARS.

2284
02:28:15,887 --> 02:28:18,344
Alright but we we have got
to figure something out or...

2285
02:28:18,368 --> 02:28:20,724
the people on Earth are gonna die.
Think, think, think!

2286
02:28:20,965 --> 02:28:21,863
<i>Cooper...</i>

2287
02:28:22,554 --> 02:28:24,668
<i>they didn't bring us

2288
02:28:28,717 --> 02:28:29,771
Say that again.

2289
02:28:30,383 --> 02:28:33,521
<i>They didn't bring us
here to change the past.</i>

2290
02:28:38,018 --> 02:28:39,847
No they didn't bring us here at all.

2291
02:28:45,002 --> 02:28:46,369
We brought ourselves.

2292
02:28:55,635 --> 02:28:56,415
TARS.

2293
02:28:56,665 --> 02:28:58,626
Give me the coordinates
for NASA...

2294
02:28:58,838 --> 02:29:00,106
in binary.

2295
02:29:00,450 --> 02:29:01,629
<i>In binary. Roger.</i>

2296
02:29:01,653 --> 02:29:02,744
<i>Feeding data.</i>

2297
02:29:27,200 --> 02:29:28,447
It's not a ghost.

2298
02:29:30,870 --> 02:29:32,072
It's gravity.

2299
02:29:32,505 --> 02:29:33,907
Don't you get it yet TARS?

2300
02:29:34,965 --> 02:29:36,322
I brought myself here!

2301
02:29:37,710 --> 02:29:38,958
We are here to communicate,

2302
02:29:39,275 --> 02:29:40,775
with the three-dimensional world.

2303
02:29:41,431 --> 02:29:42,720
We are the bridge!

2304
02:29:51,088 --> 02:29:52,553
I thought they chose me.

2305
02:29:56,380 --> 02:29:58,019
But they didn't choose me they chose her.

2306
02:29:58,245 --> 02:29:59,481
For what Cooper?

2307
02:30:02,313 --> 02:30:03,606
To save the world.

2308
02:30:08,308 --> 02:30:09,363
All of this,

2309
02:30:09,636 --> 02:30:11,282
to one little girl's bedroom.

2310
02:30:11,306 --> 02:30:12,651
Every moment.

2311
02:30:13,021 --> 02:30:14,448
It's infinitely complex.

2312
02:30:14,506 --> 02:30:15,578
They have access,

2313
02:30:15,645 --> 02:30:18,122
to infinite time and space
but they are not bound,

2314
02:30:18,146 --> 02:30:19,202
by anything!

2315
02:30:19,227 --> 02:30:22,627
They can't find a specific place
in time.

2316
02:30:22,986 --> 02:30:24,444
They can't communicate.

2317
02:30:25,600 --> 02:30:26,756
That's why I am here.

2318
02:30:27,077 --> 02:30:28,757
I am gonna find a way to tell Murph,

2319
02:30:28,803 --> 02:30:30,213
just like I found this moment.

2320
02:30:30,238 --> 02:30:31,260
<i>How Cooper?</i>

2321
02:30:31,284 --> 02:30:32,573
Love TARS love.

2322
02:30:32,941 --> 02:30:34,013
It's just like Brand said.

2323
02:30:34,037 --> 02:30:36,307
My connection with Murph,
it is quantifiable.

2324
02:30:36,474 --> 02:30:37,504
It's the key!

2325
02:30:37,646 --> 02:30:38,997
<i>What are we here to do?</i>

2326
02:30:40,523 --> 02:30:41,849
Find how to tell her.

2327
02:30:44,994 --> 02:30:46,083
The watch.

2328
02:30:49,457 --> 02:30:50,624
The watch.

2329
02:30:52,001 --> 02:30:53,015
That's it.

2330
02:30:55,630 --> 02:30:58,122
We code the data into the movement
of the second hand.

2331
02:31:02,262 --> 02:31:03,167
TARS,

2332
02:31:03,411 --> 02:31:05,472
translate the data
into Morse and feed it to me.

2333
02:31:05,640 --> 02:31:07,338
<i>Translating data to Morse.</i>

2334
02:31:07,604 --> 02:31:09,520
<i>Cooper what if she never came back for it?</i>

2335
02:31:11,604 --> 02:31:12,718
She will.

2336
02:31:13,484 --> 02:31:14,528
She will.

2337
02:31:15,583 --> 02:31:17,209
Murph I can see his car!

2338
02:31:18,419 --> 02:31:19,586
He is coming Murph!

2339
02:31:21,275 --> 02:31:22,061
Ok.

2340
02:31:22,428 --> 02:31:23,453
I am coming down.

2341
02:31:24,617 --> 02:31:25,893
<i>How do you know?</i>

2342
02:31:29,330 --> 02:31:30,705
Because I gave it to her.

2343
02:31:36,546 --> 02:31:39,047
<i>Roger. Morse is dot-dot-dash-dot.</i>

2344
02:31:42,752 --> 02:31:43,877
Dot-dot...

02:31:45,013 --> 02:31:46,680

2346
02:31:47,140 --> 02:31:48,930

02:31:54,022 --> 02:31:56,673
Dash. Dash. Dash..

2350
02:32:14,542 --> 02:32:15,433
He came back!

2351
02:32:16,770 --> 02:32:17,616
It was him...

2352
02:32:18,116 --> 02:32:19,118
all the time! I didn't...

2353
02:32:19,306 --> 02:32:20,702
I didn't know. It was him!

2354
02:32:22,050 --> 02:32:23,475
Dad is gonna save us.

2355
02:33:06,761 --> 02:33:08,123
Eureka!

2356
02:33:11,766 --> 02:33:12,824
It's traditional.

2357
02:33:17,626 --> 02:33:18,918
Eureka!

2358
02:33:24,028 --> 02:33:25,055
Did it work?

2359
02:33:25,697 --> 02:33:27,079
<i>I think it might have.</i>

2360
02:33:28,808 --> 02:33:30,000
How do you know?

2361
02:33:30,068 --> 02:33:31,023
<i>Because...</i>

2362
02:33:31,109 --> 02:33:33,216
<i>the bulk beings
are closing the tesseract.</i>

2363
02:33:37,584 --> 02:33:39,185
Don't you get it yet TARS?

2364
02:33:40,753 --> 02:33:41,906
They are not beings.

2365
02:33:43,156 --> 02:33:44,265
They are us.

2366
02:33:46,532 --> 02:33:48,046
What I have been doing for Murph,

2367
02:33:48,457 --> 02:33:49,680
they done for me.

2368
02:33:50,305 --> 02:33:51,329
For all of us.

2369
02:33:51,773 --> 02:33:53,672
<i>Cooper people could not build this.</i>

2370
02:33:54,400 --> 02:33:55,372
No. No.

2371
02:33:55,396 --> 02:33:56,423
No, not yet.

2372
02:33:57,045 --> 02:33:58,157
But one day.

2373
02:33:59,072 --> 02:34:00,136
Not you and me.

2374
02:34:01,134 --> 02:34:02,360
But people.

2375
02:34:03,151 --> 02:34:04,390
A civilization,

2376
02:34:04,414 --> 02:34:06,658
that's evolved past
the four dimensions we know.

2377
02:34:13,686 --> 02:34:14,809
What happens now?

2378
02:35:17,892 --> 02:35:18,762
Mr. Cooper.

2379
02:35:23,564 --> 02:35:24,755
Let's take it slow sir.

2380
02:35:25,566 --> 02:35:26,939
Nice and easy Mr. Cooper.

2381
02:35:27,986 --> 02:35:29,600
Remember you are no spring chicken anymore.

2382
02:35:29,889 --> 02:35:32,369
Actually you are 124 years old.

2383
02:35:39,939 --> 02:35:41,016
Take it slow sir.

2384
02:35:42,291 --> 02:35:44,172
You were... extremely lucky.

2385
02:35:44,919 --> 02:35:47,655
The Rangers found you with only minutes
left in your oxygen supply.

2386
02:36:02,337 --> 02:36:03,331
Where am I?

2387
02:36:05,340 --> 02:36:06,432
Cooper Station.

2388
02:36:08,301 --> 02:36:09,843
Currently orbiting Saturn.

2389
02:36:11,846 --> 02:36:13,672
Cooper Station.

2390
02:36:16,551 --> 02:36:18,552
Nice of you to name it after me.

2391
02:36:22,017 --> 02:36:23,017
What?

2392
02:36:23,041 --> 02:36:25,072
Well the station isn't named after you sir.

2393
02:36:25,096 --> 02:36:26,794
It's... it's named after your daughter.

2394
02:36:27,253 --> 02:36:28,951
Although she's always maintained,

2395
02:36:28,975 --> 02:36:30,255
just how important you were.

2396
02:36:30,423 --> 02:36:31,613
Is she still alive?

2397
02:36:34,093 --> 02:36:35,472
She will be here in a couple weeks.

2398
02:36:37,013 --> 02:36:39,584
She is far too old to be
transferring from another station...

2399
02:36:39,609 --> 02:36:41,292
but when she heard
that you had been found...

2400
02:36:43,027 --> 02:36:44,049
well this is...

2401
02:36:44,073 --> 02:36:45,737
this is Murphy
Cooper we are talking about.

2402
02:36:46,714 --> 02:36:47,932
Yes it is.

2403
02:36:50,544 --> 02:36:52,378
We will have you checked
out of here in a couple days.

2404
02:36:55,474 --> 02:36:58,120
I am sure you will be excited
to see what's in store.

2405
02:36:59,368 --> 02:37:00,515
I actually...

2406
02:37:00,848 --> 02:37:02,318
did a paper on you,

2407
02:37:02,342 --> 02:37:03,639
in high school.

2408
02:37:03,664 --> 02:37:05,529
I know all about your life back on Earth.

2409
02:37:07,488 --> 02:37:08,655
Oh yeah.

2410
02:37:09,003 --> 02:37:09,943
Brand.

2411
02:37:12,673 --> 02:37:15,998
If... If you will follow me we have got
a really good situation...

2412
02:37:16,740 --> 02:37:17,786
for you.

2413
02:37:21,247 --> 02:37:22,254
So...

2414
02:37:22,473 --> 02:37:24,856
when I made my suggestion to Miss Cooper...

2415
02:37:26,212 --> 02:37:29,006
I was delighted to hear
that she thought it was perfect.

2416
02:37:32,485 --> 02:37:35,911
It was just constant.
Just that steady blow of dirt.

2417
02:37:35,936 --> 02:37:38,865
Of course I...
I didn't speak to her personally.

2418
02:37:38,931 --> 02:37:40,832
<i>Set the plates upside-down.</i>

2419
02:37:40,861 --> 02:37:43,613
<i>Glasses or cups whatever
it was upside-down.</i>

2420
02:37:44,022 --> 02:37:45,652
<i>Well my dad was a farmer.</i>

2421
02:37:46,772 --> 02:37:48,670
<i>Like everybody else back then.</i>

2422
02:37:49,110 --> 02:37:51,686
<i>There just was not enough... food.</i>

2423
02:37:51,838 --> 02:37:54,548
<i>We wore little things little strips...</i>

2424
02:37:54,715 --> 02:37:59,886
<i>of sheet over our nose and mouth
so we would not breathe so much of it.</i>

2425
02:37:59,954 --> 02:38:03,175
<i>Well it was pretty exciting
for me because it was hope.</i>

2426
02:38:03,683 --> 02:38:07,894
<i>I don't care who describes it there is no
way for it to be exaggerated. It was that bad.</i>

2427
02:38:07,952 --> 02:38:08,842
She did,

2428
02:38:08,866 --> 02:38:11,514
confirm just how much you loved farming.

2429
02:38:11,966 --> 02:38:13,748
Oh she did, did she?
Yeah.

2430
02:38:13,773 --> 02:38:14,803
Come here.

2431
02:38:15,595 --> 02:38:16,683
Home sweet home.

2432
02:38:17,198 --> 02:38:18,644
Everything replaced and...

2433
02:38:19,144 --> 02:38:20,423
put back where it...

2434
02:38:27,027 --> 02:38:29,183
Hey is this...
Oh yeah the...

2435
02:38:29,222 --> 02:38:32,224
The machine we found out near Saturn
when we found you. Yes.

2436
02:38:32,659 --> 02:38:35,416
Its power source was shot
but we could get you another one if you wanted.

2437
02:38:35,441 --> 02:38:36,036
Yes.

2438
02:38:36,395 --> 02:38:37,315

The family is all in there.

2462
02:39:50,790 --> 02:39:51,707
Family?

2463
02:39:51,841 --> 02:39:53,530
Yeah they all came out to see her.

2464
02:39:53,554 --> 02:39:55,719
She is been in cryo-sleep
for almost two years.

2465
02:40:28,886 --> 02:40:30,761
You told them I like farming.

2466
02:40:36,736 --> 02:40:38,013
It was me Murph.

2467
02:40:41,131 --> 02:40:42,615
I was your ghost.

2468
02:40:44,051 --> 02:40:45,240
I know.

2469
02:40:47,471 --> 02:40:49,119
People didn't believe me.

2470
02:40:49,143 --> 02:40:51,654
They thought that I was doing it all myself.

2471
02:40:52,351 --> 02:40:53,130
But...

2472
02:40:56,272 --> 02:40:57,753
I knew who it was.

2473
02:41:02,991 --> 02:41:04,557
Nobody believed me.

2474
02:41:05,865 --> 02:41:07,609
But I knew you would come back.

2475
02:41:10,498 --> 02:41:11,523
How?

2476
02:41:13,981 --> 02:41:16,716
Because my dad promised me.

2477
02:41:23,257 --> 02:41:24,630
Well I am here now Murph.

02:41:26,358 --> 02:41:27,404
I am here.

2479
02:41:29,183 --> 02:41:30,045
No.

2480
02:41:32,704 --> 02:41:36,186
No parent should have
to watch their own child die.

2481
02:41:39,715 --> 02:41:41,889
I have my kids here for me now.

2482
02:41:44,775 --> 02:41:46,022
You go.

2483
02:41:49,574 --> 02:41:50,473
Where?

2484
02:41:54,705 --> 02:41:55,652
Brand.

2485
02:42:05,733 --> 02:42:07,459
<i>She is out there...</i>

2486
02:42:13,362 --> 02:42:15,113
<i>setting up camp.</i>

2487
02:42:42,420 --> 02:42:43,387
<i>Alone...</i>

2488
02:42:45,172 --> 02:42:47,142
<i>in a strange galaxy.</i>

2489
02:42:58,729 --> 02:43:00,448
<i>Maybe right now she is...</i>

2490
02:43:01,163 --> 02:43:03,268
<i>settling in for the long nap...</i>

2491
02:43:21,676 --> 02:43:24,182
<i>by the light of our new sun...</i>

2492
02:43:39,986 --> 02:43:41,420
<i>in our new home.</i>

2493
02:43:56,910 --> 02:43:59,910
