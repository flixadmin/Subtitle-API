1
00:01:12,865 --> 00:01:16,410
Pull yourself together, Teddy.
Pull yourself together.

2
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:24,502
It's just water.

3
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:27,672
It's a lot of water.

4
00:01:28,214 --> 00:01:29,715
A lot of...

5
00:01:33,261 --> 00:01:34,637
Come on.

6
00:01:58,703 --> 00:02:01,831
- You okay, boss?
- Yeah, I'm fine, I just...

7
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,710
I just can't... Can't stomach the water.

8
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:11,882
- You're my new partner.
- That's right.

9
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:15,970
Not the best way to meet,
with my head halfway down the toilet.

10
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:19,098
Doesn't exactly square with
"Teddy Daniels, the man, the legend,"

11
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:21,642
- I'll give you that.
- The legend?

12
00:02:21,726 --> 00:02:24,395
What the hell you boys smoking
over there in Portland, anyway?

13
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:27,857
Seattle. I came from
the office in Seattle.

14
00:02:30,568 --> 00:02:32,737
How long you been with the Marshals?

15
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,238
Four years.

16
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:38,159
So you know how small it is.

17
00:02:38,576 --> 00:02:39,660
Sure.

18
00:02:40,703 --> 00:02:43,664
What about you?
You got a girl? Married?

19
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:45,750
I was.

20
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,221
She died.

21
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:03,184
- Jesus. I don't...
- Don't worry about it.

22
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:07,813
There was a fire at the apartment
building while I was at work.

23
00:03:07,897 --> 00:03:09,607
Four people died.

24
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:13,527
It was the smoke that got her,
not the fire. See, that's important.

25
00:03:13,611 --> 00:03:15,321
I'm sorry, boss.

26
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:18,199
Where are my goddamn cigarettes?

27
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:20,368
Oh, here, have one of mine.

28
00:03:20,451 --> 00:03:23,954
I could've sworn they were
in my jacket before I got on.

29
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:26,749
Government employees
will rob you blind.

30
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,419
Thanks.

31
00:03:31,462 --> 00:03:34,215
They give you a briefing about
the institution before you left?

32
00:03:34,298 --> 00:03:36,967
All I know is it's a mental hospital.

33
00:03:37,802 --> 00:03:39,929
For the criminally insane.

34
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:43,099
Well, if it's just folks running
around hearing voices

35
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:46,644
and chasing after butterflies,
they wouldn't need us.

36
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,656
- Is that where we're headed?
- Yep.

37
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:01,534
The other side of the island
is rock bluffs

38
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:04,161
all the way down
to the edge of the water.

39
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:07,706
The dock, it's the only way on or off.

40
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:11,752
We'll be casting off
as soon as you two are ashore.

41
00:04:11,836 --> 00:04:14,463
I'd appreciate it if you'd hurry up about it.

42
00:04:14,547 --> 00:04:17,299
- Why?
- Storm's coming.

43
00:04:43,701 --> 00:04:46,328
Never seen a Marshals badge before.

44
00:04:47,997 --> 00:04:49,874
I'm Deputy Warden McPherson,
gentlemen.

45
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:51,125
Welcome to Shutter Island.

46
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:54,253
I'll be the one taking you
up to Ashecliffe.

47
00:05:06,557 --> 00:05:09,435
Your boys seem a little on edge,
Mr. McPherson.

48
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:11,896
Right now, Marshal, we all are.

49
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:58,192
Electrified perimeter.

50
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:01,779
How can you tell?

51
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:04,698
I've seen something like it before.

52
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:37,147
All right. You gentlemen will
be accorded all the help we can give,

53
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:40,192
but during your stay,
you will obey protocol.

54
00:06:40,276 --> 00:06:41,652
Is that understood?

55
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,112
Absolutely.

56
00:06:43,571 --> 00:06:46,907
The red brick building on your right
is Ward A, the male ward.

57
00:06:46,991 --> 00:06:50,369
Ward B, the female ward,
is the one on your left.

58
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:53,414
Ward C is that building on the bluffs.

59
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:55,082
An old Civil War fort.

60
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:57,585
The most dangerous patients
are housed there.

61
00:06:57,668 --> 00:06:59,587
Admittance to Ward C is forbidden

62
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:02,339
without the written consent
and physical presence

63
00:07:02,423 --> 00:07:04,967
of both myself and Dr. Cawley.

64
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,844
Is that understood?

65
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:10,222
You act like insanity is catching.

66
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,353
You are hereby required
to surrender your firearms.

67
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:21,233
Mr. McPherson, we are duly appointed
federal marshals.

68
00:07:21,317 --> 00:07:23,819
We are required to carry our firearms
with us at all times.

69
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:26,905
Executive order 319
of the Federal Code of Penitentiaries

70
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:29,033
states that when inside a penitentiary,

71
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:32,536
the officers of that institution
have final authority.

72
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:39,418
Gentlemen, you will not get through
this gate with your firearms.

73
00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:02,149
Okay. Now that the official stuff's done,
come on, boys,

74
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,193
what do you say we go find Dr. Cawley?

75
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:18,916
When did she escape? This prisoner?

76
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:23,170
I'm afraid Dr. Cawley will have
to fill you in on the situation. Protocol.

77
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:25,381
Correctional officers
at a mental institution,

78
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:27,633
that's a weird sight,
if you don't mind me saying.

79
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:31,136
It's the only facility of its kind in the U.S.,
even the world.

80
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,764
We take only the most dangerous,
damaged patients,

81
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,808
ones no other hospital can manage.

82
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:37,810
And it's all due to Dr. Cawley.

83
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:39,812
He's created something
really unique here.

84
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:43,482
It's a hospital for people our society
normally considers beyond treatment.

85
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,050
Top of his class at Johns Hopkins,
then Harvard...

86
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:13,220
IDs, gentlemen.

87
00:09:16,724 --> 00:09:18,851
Show your badges, gentlemen.

88
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:22,896
Dr. Cawley's been consulted
numerous times by Scotland Yard,

89
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,732
MI5, the OSS...

90
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:26,400
Why?

91
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:28,152
What do you mean?

92
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:32,740
What do intelligence agencies
want to consult a psychiatrist about?

93
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:35,117
I guess you'll have to ask him.

94
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,004
- Marshal Daniels.
- Doctor.

95
00:09:47,463 --> 00:09:49,047
Marshal Aule.

96
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:52,217
Thank you, Deputy Warden.
That will be all.

97
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:54,970
Yes, sir. Pleasure, gentlemen.

98
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:58,307
He had a lot to say about you.

99
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:01,602
McPherson's a good man.
He believes in the work we do here.

100
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:03,979
And what would that be, exactly?

101
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:07,733
A moral fusion between law and order
and clinical care.

102
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:10,819
Pardon me, Doc.
A what between what and what?

103
00:10:17,785 --> 00:10:20,829
Those paintings are quite accurate.

104
00:10:20,913 --> 00:10:22,790
Used to be the kind of patients
we deal with here

105
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:26,084
were shackled and left in their own filth.

106
00:10:26,168 --> 00:10:27,461
They were beaten,

107
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,797
as if whipping them bloody
would drive the psychosis out.

108
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,965
We drove screws into their brains,

109
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:35,886
we submerged them in icy water
until they lost consciousness

110
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,430
or even drowned.

111
00:10:38,514 --> 00:10:40,474
- And now?
- We treat them.

112
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:42,768
Try to heal, try to cure.

113
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:44,478
And if that fails,
at least we provide them

114
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:47,815
with a measure of comfort
in their lives. Calm.

115
00:10:47,898 --> 00:10:51,151
These are all violent offenders, right?

116
00:10:51,235 --> 00:10:53,487
I mean, they've hurt people.

117
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:57,991
- Murdered them in some cases.
- In almost all cases, yes.

118
00:10:58,075 --> 00:10:59,910
Then, personally, Doctor,
I'd have to say,

119
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:02,371
screw their sense of calm.

120
00:11:03,956 --> 00:11:06,166
It's my job to treat my patients,
not their victims.

121
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,709
I'm not here to judge.

122
00:11:07,793 --> 00:11:10,420
- So this female prisoner...
- Patient.

123
00:11:11,255 --> 00:11:13,173
Excuse me. Patient,

124
00:11:13,257 --> 00:11:18,345
one Rachel Solando,
escaped sometime in the last 24 hours.

125
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:20,681
Last night between 10:00 and midnight.

126
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:22,349
Is she considered dangerous?

127
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:26,061
You could say that.
She killed all three of her children.

128
00:11:26,979 --> 00:11:29,857
She drowned them in the lake
behind her house.

129
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:33,235
She took them out one by one,
held their heads under till they died,

130
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:36,196
then she brought them back inside and
arranged them around the kitchen table.

131
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,616
She ate a meal there
before a neighbor dropped by.

132
00:11:41,577 --> 00:11:45,455
- And what about the husband?
- He died on the beaches of Normandy.

133
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:49,543
She's a war widow. She starved herself
when she first came here.

134
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:52,462
She insisted the children weren't dead.

135
00:12:02,306 --> 00:12:05,058
Sorry, Doctor. You don't happen
to have an aspirin, do you?

136
00:12:05,142 --> 00:12:06,810
Prone to headaches, Marshal?

137
00:12:06,894 --> 00:12:10,147
Sometimes. But today,
I'm a little more prone to seasickness.

138
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:12,107
Dehydration.

139
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,817
- You all right, boss?
- Yeah.

140
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:16,612
In that case, you're quite right.
The simpler the better.

141
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:18,238
Thanks so much.

142
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:22,117
Rachel still believes
the children are alive.

143
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:26,455
She also believes this place is her home
in the Berkshires.

144
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:28,707
You're kidding me.

145
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,042
She's never once in two years

146
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,793
acknowledged that
she's in an institution.

147
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:35,756
She believes we're all deliverymen,
milkmen, postal workers.

148
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,050
To sustain the delusion
that her children never died,

149
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:40,135
she's created
an elaborate fictional structure,

150
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:43,597
and she gives us all parts
to play in that fiction.

151
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:46,600
So have you searched the grounds yet?

152
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:49,269
The warden and his men
scoured the island.

153
00:12:49,353 --> 00:12:50,854
Not a trace.

154
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:55,984
And what's more disturbing is we don't
know how she got out of her room.

155
00:12:56,068 --> 00:12:59,863
It was locked from the outside,
and the only window is barred.

156
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:06,161
It's as if she evaporated
straight through the walls.

157
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:15,879
I brought her right back here
after group therapy, locked her in,

158
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:18,966
came back for midnight rounds,
she was gone.

159
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:29,977
Seriously, Doctor, how is it possible
that the truth never gets through to her?

160
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,980
I mean,
she's in a mental institution, right?

161
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:35,065
Seems like something you'd notice
from time to time.

162
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:37,317
How many pairs of shoes
are the patients given?

163
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:38,777
Two pairs.

164
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:43,115
Sanity's not a choice, Marshal.
You can't just choose to get over it.

165
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:46,618
So, she left here barefoot?

166
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:50,497
Come on, Doc, she couldn't get
10 yards in that terrain.

167
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:53,166
Marshal?

168
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:14,187
This is definitely Rachel's handwriting.

169
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:17,107
I have no idea
what the law of four is, though.

170
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:20,027
- It's not a psychiatric term?
- I'm afraid not.

171
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,611
"Who is 67?"

172
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:23,947
Fuck if I know.

173
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:27,868
I have to say that's quite close
to my clinical conclusion.

174
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:29,870
Think it's just random scribblings?

175
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:33,707
Oh, no, not at all. Rachel's smart.
Brilliant, in fact.

176
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,208
This paper could be important.

177
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:38,170
Excuse me, Doctor,
but we're gonna have to hold on to this.

178
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:39,629
Of course.

179
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:44,426
And you say
she had to come through here?

180
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:48,764
After lights out,
the orderlies play cards in here.

181
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:52,184
Last night, there were seven men
sitting at the base of those stairs

182
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:53,727
playing stud poker.

183
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,855
Yet somehow,
Rachel managed to slip past them.

184
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:58,565
Why?

185
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:01,276
How? She turns invisible?

186
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:04,237
Doctor, we're gonna need access
to the personnel files

187
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:05,363
of all the medical staff.

188
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:08,241
The nurses, the guards, the orderlies,
anyone who was working then.

189
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:11,119
We'll take your request
under consideration.

190
00:15:11,203 --> 00:15:13,830
This is not a request, Doctor.

191
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:16,416
This is a federal facility,
and a dangerous prisoner...

192
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,710
- Patient.
- ...patient

193
00:15:18,794 --> 00:15:21,088
has escaped. Now, you will comply or...

194
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:23,507
All I can say is I'll see what I can do.

195
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,426
Doctor, we're gonna need
to speak with the staff.

196
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,553
Do you understand?

197
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:30,847
I'll assemble them in the common room
after dinner.

198
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:33,225
<i>If you have any further questions,</i>

199
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:36,603
<i>feel free to join the deputy warden
in the search.</i>

200
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:52,369
It's 11 miles to the nearest land
and the water's freezing.

201
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:55,497
Current was strong last night,
tide pushing in.

202
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,165
She'd have drowned
or been crushed on the rocks,

203
00:15:57,249 --> 00:16:00,418
and her body would have
washed back up on shore.

204
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:06,633
What about those caves down there?
Have you checked them?

205
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:09,094
No way she could get there.

206
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:11,972
The bases of those cliffs
are covered in poison ivy,

207
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:16,101
live oak, sumac, a thousand plants
with thorns as big as my dick.

208
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:20,063
You said yourself, Marshal,
she's got no shoes.

209
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,071
All right, let's check the other side.

210
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:36,413
- What's that tower?
- It's an old lighthouse.

211
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,875
The guards already searched inside it.

212
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:44,004
What's in there? More patients?

213
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:46,214
Sewage treatment facility.

214
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:50,594
It's getting dark soon.
I'm calling this off for tonight.

215
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:52,220
Let's go, boys!

216
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:58,018
<i>You were on watch on the landing, huh?</i>

217
00:16:58,101 --> 00:17:01,521
Yeah. Couldn't nobody get in or out
of their room on that corridor

218
00:17:01,605 --> 00:17:03,356
without me seeing.

219
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,153
Okay, Rachel Solando, who else does
she have to pass to get down here?

220
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:17,037
Me. Glen Miga.

221
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:19,873
Sir, I didn't see nothing.

222
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:22,292
And you were at your post all night?

223
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,711
Yeah, but I didn't see a thing.

224
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:27,923
Glen.

225
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:30,759
Glen.

226
00:17:33,595 --> 00:17:35,347
Tell me the truth.

227
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:37,766
I...

228
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:42,062
I maybe went to the bathroom.

229
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:45,232
What? You breached protocol. Christ...

230
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:47,651
I wasn't gone more than a minute.

231
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:50,737
All right, look. Let's back up here.
Let's all just back up.

232
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:54,241
Miss Solando was put in her room
for lights out.

233
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:57,744
Does anyone here know
what she did before that?

234
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:59,037
Anyone?

235
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:02,958
Come on, anyone,
anyone, anyone, anyone.

236
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,543
She was in a group therapy session.

237
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:08,922
Anything unusual occur?

238
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:11,216
Define "unusual."

239
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:12,759
Excuse me?

240
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:17,222
This is a mental institution, Marshal,
for the criminally insane.

241
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:19,849
Usual isn't a big part of our day.

242
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:22,936
I will rephrase.

243
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:26,940
Did anything happen last night
during group therapy that was more,

244
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:29,526
let's say, I don't know,
memorable than...

245
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,361
- Normal?
- Exactly.

246
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:33,822
No. Sorry.

247
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:37,492
Did Miss Solando say anything
during group therapy?

248
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:40,662
She was worried about the rain.

249
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:45,208
And she hated the food here.
Complained constantly,

250
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:47,043
last night included.

251
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,548
So you were there.
Was there a doctor present?

252
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,968
Yes, Dr. Sheehan led the discussion.

253
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:57,429
Dr. Sheehan?

254
00:18:58,138 --> 00:19:00,473
Yes, he was running the session.

255
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:06,313
He's Rachel's primary, the psychiatrist
who directly oversees her care.

256
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:10,817
We're gonna need
to speak with Dr. Sheehan.

257
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:15,405
I'm afraid that won't be possible.
He left on the ferry this morning.

258
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:18,825
His vacation was already planned.
He'd been putting it off too long.

259
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:23,663
You're in a state of lockdown,
a dangerous patient has escaped,

260
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:27,917
and you let her primary doctor
leave on vacation?

261
00:19:28,752 --> 00:19:31,171
Well, of course. He's a doctor.

262
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:38,345
Do you have the phone number
for where he's gone?

263
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:40,722
Hello? Hello?

264
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:44,225
Hello?

265
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:46,603
Anybody there?

266
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:49,314
I'm sorry, sir, but it's all down.
All the lines.

267
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:51,274
The storm's hitting the mainland
like a hammer.

268
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:53,318
If you get it working,
come find me immediately.

269
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:55,862
The marshals need to make
an important call.

270
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:57,280
Yes, sir.

271
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:03,328
Hello? Hello?

272
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:05,497
I'm afraid I have evening rounds
in the wards,

273
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:09,334
but I'll be having drinks and a cigar
at my house around 9:00,

274
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:11,419
if you'd care to drop by.

275
00:20:11,503 --> 00:20:13,797
Good. We can talk then, right?

276
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:18,259
We have been talking, Marshal.

277
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:38,029
Gotta say, I'm thinking
I got in the wrong line of public service.

278
00:20:38,113 --> 00:20:41,574
It is a little overwhelming.
It was constructed during the Civil War,

279
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:44,911
the same time as the military fort
housing Ward C.

280
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:54,254
This is the original
commander's quarters.

281
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:57,924
When Uncle Sam got the bill,
the commander was court-martialed.

282
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:00,051
I can see why.

283
00:21:00,135 --> 00:21:02,679
Nice music. Who is that? Brahms?

284
00:21:03,513 --> 00:21:04,639
No.

285
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:16,192
- It's Mahler.
- Quite right, Marshal.

286
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:20,905
Forgive me, gentlemen.
My colleague, Dr. Jeremiah Naehring.

287
00:21:29,664 --> 00:21:32,500
<i>Quartet for Piano and Strings
in A minor.</i>

288
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:37,630
Your poison, gentlemen?

289
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:40,717
- Rye, if you got it.
- Soda and ice, please. Thanks.

290
00:21:41,718 --> 00:21:45,388
You don't indulge in alcohol?
I'm surprised.

291
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:50,393
Isn't it common for men
in your profession to imbibe?

292
00:21:50,894 --> 00:21:53,730
Common enough. And yours?

293
00:21:55,398 --> 00:21:56,524
I'm sorry?

294
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:59,486
- Your profession, Doctor. Psychiatry.
- Yes.

295
00:21:59,569 --> 00:22:03,031
I always heard it was overrun
with boozers and drunks.

296
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:05,909
Not that I've noticed.

297
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:09,120
What's that?
Iced tea in your glass, there?

298
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:11,831
Excellent, Marshal.

299
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:15,084
You have outstanding
defense mechanisms.

300
00:22:15,585 --> 00:22:19,506
You must be quite adept
at interrogations, hmm?

301
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:30,975
Men like you are my specialty,
you know?

302
00:22:31,643 --> 00:22:33,353
Men of violence.

303
00:22:33,436 --> 00:22:35,313
Now that's a hell of an assumption
to make.

304
00:22:35,396 --> 00:22:37,023
No assumption. No, not at all.

305
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:41,152
You misunderstand me.
I said you are men of violence.

306
00:22:41,236 --> 00:22:44,364
I'm not accusing you
of being violent men.

307
00:22:44,447 --> 00:22:45,448
That's quite different.

308
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:48,368
No, please. Please. Edify us, Doctor.

309
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,039
You both served overseas, huh?

310
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:54,374
It's not much of a stretch, Doc.

311
00:22:54,457 --> 00:22:57,961
For all you know,
we were both paper pushers over there.

312
00:22:58,044 --> 00:22:59,504
No, you were not.

313
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:16,604
Since the schoolyard,

314
00:23:16,688 --> 00:23:20,733
neither of you has ever walked away
from a physical conflict.

315
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:22,986
No, no, not because you enjoy it,

316
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:26,948
but because retreat isn't something
you consider an option.

317
00:23:27,282 --> 00:23:28,950
We weren't raised to run, Doc.

318
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:32,161
Yes. "Raised."

319
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:36,499
And who raised you, Marshal?

320
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,167
Me?

321
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:40,670
Wolves.

322
00:23:44,382 --> 00:23:46,509
Very impressive defense mechanisms.

323
00:24:46,194 --> 00:24:47,695
<i>Do you believe in God, Marshal?</i>

324
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:55,828
No, I'm quite serious.

325
00:25:01,751 --> 00:25:04,420
You ever seen a death camp, Doctor?

326
00:25:19,811 --> 00:25:21,813
His English really is very good.

327
00:25:21,896 --> 00:25:24,732
You hit the consonants
a tad hard, though.

328
00:25:25,817 --> 00:25:27,485
You're a German?

329
00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:30,697
Is legal immigration a crime, Marshal?

330
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:33,199
I don't know, Doctor. You tell us.

331
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:36,703
Now, listen.

332
00:25:36,786 --> 00:25:38,705
We're gonna need those files
on Sheehan

333
00:25:38,788 --> 00:25:40,581
and the rest of the staff as well.

334
00:25:40,665 --> 00:25:43,793
No personnel files will
be released to you. Period.

335
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:46,963
- We're gonna need those files.
- Out of the question.

336
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:48,548
Bullshit, out of the question!

337
00:25:48,631 --> 00:25:49,716
Bullshit!

338
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:52,593
Just who the hell's in charge here,
anyway, huh?

339
00:25:52,677 --> 00:25:56,222
Dr. Naehring acts as liaison
to our Board of Overseers.

340
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:58,474
He relayed your request,
and it's been refused.

341
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:01,894
Refused? They don't have the authority
to refuse, and neither do you, sir.

342
00:26:01,978 --> 00:26:05,690
Marshal, continue your investigation
and we'll do all we can to help.

343
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:07,358
This investigation is over.

344
00:26:07,442 --> 00:26:09,736
We're gonna file our reports
and we're gonna hand it over to...

345
00:26:09,819 --> 00:26:12,321
- Hoover's boys.
- Hoover's boys. That's right.

346
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:16,159
We'll be taking the ferry back
in the morning. Come on, Chuck.

347
00:26:24,751 --> 00:26:26,169
Nice night.

348
00:26:32,133 --> 00:26:35,178
You'll be bunking
in the orderlies' quarters.

349
00:26:46,981 --> 00:26:48,316
Hey, boss.

350
00:26:48,858 --> 00:26:51,027
We really packing it in?

351
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:52,820
Why?

352
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:57,658
I guess... I don't know,
I just never really quit anything before.

353
00:26:58,075 --> 00:27:00,912
We haven't heard the truth
once yet, Chuck.

354
00:27:01,621 --> 00:27:05,249
Listen, Rachel Solando didn't slip out
of a locked cell, barefoot,

355
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:06,542
without any help.

356
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:10,254
I think she had a lot of help.

357
00:27:10,338 --> 00:27:12,924
Maybe Cawley's sitting up
in his mansion right now

358
00:27:13,007 --> 00:27:15,301
rethinking his whole attitude.

359
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:19,847
- Maybe, in the morning, we'll be...
- You're bluffing?

360
00:27:20,348 --> 00:27:22,099
I didn't say that.

361
00:27:40,535 --> 00:27:43,162
I found a whole stack of these, Teddy.

362
00:27:43,871 --> 00:27:46,290
Jesus, are you ever sober anymore?

363
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:50,086
I killed a lot of people in the war.

364
00:27:51,838 --> 00:27:53,714
Is that why you drink?

365
00:27:56,551 --> 00:27:58,052
Are you real?

366
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,263
No.

367
00:28:04,267 --> 00:28:05,935
She's still here.

368
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:07,937
Who?

369
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:10,273
Rachel?

370
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:13,150
She never left.

371
00:28:26,956 --> 00:28:30,668
Remember when we stayed
in the cabin in the summer, Teddy?

372
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,170
We were so happy.

373
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:37,008
She's here.

374
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:39,051
You can't leave.

375
00:28:51,898 --> 00:28:53,733
I'm not gonna leave.

376
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:56,986
I love you so much.

377
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:03,910
I'm just bones in a box, Teddy.

378
00:29:03,993 --> 00:29:05,036
No.

379
00:29:06,704 --> 00:29:07,997
I am.

380
00:29:10,875 --> 00:29:12,793
You have to wake up.

381
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:16,172
I won't go.

382
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:18,758
You're here.

383
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:24,555
I'm not. You have to face that.

384
00:29:27,767 --> 00:29:29,226
But she is.

385
00:29:31,437 --> 00:29:32,855
So is he.

386
00:29:34,941 --> 00:29:36,150
Who?

387
00:29:38,611 --> 00:29:39,987
Laeddis.

388
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:46,619
- I have to go.
- No.

389
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:51,374
No, please. Please.
I need to hold on to you.

390
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:54,710
- Just a little bit longer, please.
- Oh, God, Teddy.

391
00:29:54,794 --> 00:29:56,796
You have to let me go.

392
00:29:58,214 --> 00:29:59,590
I can't.

393
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,708
Ain't gonna be no ferry in this shit.

394
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:39,922
Doctor!

395
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:42,133
Doctor, Doctor.

396
00:30:42,216 --> 00:30:45,219
We need to interview the patients who
were in Rachel's group therapy session.

397
00:30:45,302 --> 00:30:47,221
I thought your investigation was finished.

398
00:30:47,304 --> 00:30:50,266
Well, it's not like
we could take the ferry.

399
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:54,395
Now, was Rachel receiving
any other treatments for her illnesses?

400
00:30:54,854 --> 00:30:58,524
Do you know the state of the mental
health field these days, gentlemen?

401
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:00,776
No, not a clue, Doctor.

402
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,194
War.

403
00:31:02,278 --> 00:31:05,031
The old school believes
in surgical intervention.

404
00:31:05,114 --> 00:31:06,615
Psychosurgery.

405
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:09,660
Procedures like
the transorbital lobotomy.

406
00:31:10,786 --> 00:31:14,081
Some say the patients
become reasonable, docile.

407
00:31:14,165 --> 00:31:16,459
Others say they become zombies.

408
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:18,711
- And the new school?
- Psychopharmacology.

409
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:21,047
A new drug has just been approved
called Thorazine,

410
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:24,300
which relaxes psychotic patients,
you could say tames them.

411
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:25,718
And which school are you, Doctor?

412
00:31:25,801 --> 00:31:30,347
Me? I have this radical idea that
if you treat a patient with respect,

413
00:31:30,431 --> 00:31:34,560
listen to him, try and understand,
you just might reach him.

414
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:40,483
Come on, Marge. It's okay.

415
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:43,444
- These patients, huh?
- Even these.

416
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:45,946
What should be a last resort
is becoming a first response.

417
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:49,909
Give them a pill, put them in a corner,
it all goes away.

418
00:31:49,992 --> 00:31:52,244
Rachel Solando was on
a combination of drugs

419
00:31:52,328 --> 00:31:54,246
meant to keep her
from becoming violent,

420
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:57,416
but it was only intermittently effective.

421
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,126
The greatest obstacle to her recovery

422
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:02,171
was her refusal
to face what she had done.

423
00:32:02,963 --> 00:32:04,173
"Was."

424
00:32:04,715 --> 00:32:09,595
Is there a reason you keep referring to
your patient in the past tense, Doctor?

425
00:32:12,223 --> 00:32:15,726
Look outside, Marshal.
Why do you think?

426
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:24,276
Next up is Peter Breene.

427
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,695
Assaulted his father's nurse
with broken glass.

428
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:30,324
Nurse survived,
but her face is permanently disfigured.

429
00:32:30,407 --> 00:32:31,867
I can't wait.

430
00:32:31,951 --> 00:32:38,124
She'd smile at me. She was so sweet,
but you could see it in her eyes.

431
00:32:38,207 --> 00:32:41,585
She liked to be naked, to suck cock.

432
00:32:43,003 --> 00:32:44,713
Okay, Mr. Breene.

433
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:48,759
And then she asked me
if she can have a glass of water?

434
00:32:48,843 --> 00:32:52,012
Alone, in the kitchen,
like that's no big deal?

435
00:32:52,972 --> 00:32:56,058
- Well, why was that a big deal?
- It was obvious.

436
00:32:56,142 --> 00:33:00,354
She wanted me to pull out my thing
so that she could laugh at it.

437
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:03,899
Mr. Breene.

438
00:33:05,234 --> 00:33:08,070
We need to ask you
some questions, okay?

439
00:33:10,239 --> 00:33:12,491
When I cut her, she screamed.

440
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:17,121
But she scared me.

441
00:33:18,247 --> 00:33:21,417
- What did she expect?
- Interesting.

442
00:33:22,418 --> 00:33:26,046
But we're here
to talk about Rachel Solando, okay?

443
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:28,174
Rachel Solando. Do you...

444
00:33:28,257 --> 00:33:30,509
Do you know that
she drowned her own kids?

445
00:33:30,593 --> 00:33:32,720
She drowned her kids!

446
00:33:32,803 --> 00:33:35,848
This is... This is a sick fucking world
we live in, I'll tell you that.

447
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:37,683
But you know what?
They should be gassed.

448
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:42,021
All of them.
The retards, the killers, the niggers.

449
00:33:42,104 --> 00:33:44,773
You kill your own kid, gas the bitch.

450
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,945
Could you stop that?

451
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:53,866
- That nurse...
- Please, stop that.

452
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:57,036
That nurse, maybe she had kids, huh?

453
00:33:58,954 --> 00:34:00,372
A husband.

454
00:34:01,498 --> 00:34:03,834
Just trying to make ends meet,

455
00:34:05,211 --> 00:34:07,504
lead a normal life.

456
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:10,758
It says in your file that

457
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:14,303
you tore her face off. Didn't you?

458
00:34:15,804 --> 00:34:16,764
Congratulations.

459
00:34:16,847 --> 00:34:19,767
No more normal for her,
not ever again. No.

460
00:34:21,602 --> 00:34:24,230
Do you know what she was afraid of?

461
00:34:27,024 --> 00:34:28,067
You.

462
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:30,402
Could you stop that? Please?

463
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:33,781
Stop that!

464
00:34:34,657 --> 00:34:36,075
Please! Stop!

465
00:34:36,158 --> 00:34:38,327
Do you know a patient
named Andrew Laeddis? Do you?

466
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:39,620
No! No.

467
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:41,747
- Boss. What's up?
- Fine.

468
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:43,832
- I wanna go back. I wanna go.
- Peter!

469
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:47,544
Come on! I got him. Peter! Peter!
Hey, Peter!

470
00:34:47,628 --> 00:34:48,963
Go back.

471
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:50,422
- I wanna go back.
- Come on, Peter.

472
00:34:50,506 --> 00:34:51,632
- I don't wanna see him.
- Easy now.

473
00:34:51,715 --> 00:34:54,510
- I don't wanna see him anymore.
- It's okay. It's all right.

474
00:35:00,641 --> 00:35:04,353
Oh, I'll never get out of here.
I'm not sure that I should.

475
00:35:06,188 --> 00:35:08,691
Excuse me for saying this,
Miss Kearns...

476
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:11,527
- Mrs.
- Mrs. Kearns.

477
00:35:13,195 --> 00:35:16,115
But you seem quite normal.

478
00:35:16,198 --> 00:35:19,410
I mean, in comparison
to the other patients here.

479
00:35:19,493 --> 00:35:23,122
Well, I have my dark days.
I suppose everybody does.

480
00:35:24,206 --> 00:35:28,544
The difference is most people
don't kill their husbands with an ax.

481
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,631
Although, personally,
I think if a man beats you

482
00:35:32,715 --> 00:35:37,553
and fucks half the women he sees,
and no one will help you,

483
00:35:38,262 --> 00:35:42,057
axing him isn't the least
understandable thing you could do.

484
00:35:43,392 --> 00:35:45,019
Maybe you shouldn't get out.

485
00:35:46,603 --> 00:35:50,983
What would I do if I did?
I don't know the world anymore.

486
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:55,779
They say there are bombs
that can reduce whole cities to ash.

487
00:35:55,863 --> 00:36:01,201
And what do you call them, televisions,
voices and faces coming from a box.

488
00:36:02,161 --> 00:36:04,455
I hear enough voices already.

489
00:36:05,414 --> 00:36:07,583
What can you tell us about Rachel?

490
00:36:10,461 --> 00:36:13,672
Not much. She keeps to herself.

491
00:36:13,756 --> 00:36:17,176
She believed her kids were alive.

492
00:36:17,968 --> 00:36:20,304
She thought she was still living
in the Berkshires,

493
00:36:20,387 --> 00:36:25,351
and we were all her neighbors,
the milkmen, postmen...

494
00:36:25,434 --> 00:36:26,977
Deliverymen.

495
00:36:27,978 --> 00:36:30,606
And Dr. Sheehan was there that night?

496
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:34,276
Yes. He talked about anger.

497
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:40,240
Tell me about him. What's he like?

498
00:36:42,785 --> 00:36:47,456
He's okay. Nice.

499
00:36:49,458 --> 00:36:52,461
Not hard on the eyes,
as my mother would say.

500
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:58,175
- Did he ever make a pass at you?
- No.

501
00:36:59,343 --> 00:37:02,638
No, Dr. Sheehan's a good doctor,
he would never...

502
00:37:06,016 --> 00:37:08,310
Could I have a glass of water, please?

503
00:37:08,394 --> 00:37:09,812
No problem.

504
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,995
- Thank you, Marshal.
- Sure.

505
00:37:30,707 --> 00:37:34,086
I just have one more question for you,
Mrs. Kearns.

506
00:37:37,339 --> 00:37:40,634
Did you ever meet a patient
named Andrew Laeddis?

507
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,888
No.

508
00:37:46,265 --> 00:37:48,100
Never heard of him.

509
00:37:53,856 --> 00:37:55,023
<i>She was coached.</i>

510
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:58,193
She used practically the same words
as Cawley and the nurse,

511
00:37:58,277 --> 00:37:59,778
like she'd been told exactly what to say.

512
00:37:59,862 --> 00:38:01,697
Who's Andrew Laeddis?

513
00:38:06,285 --> 00:38:10,622
You asked every one of those patients
back there about him. Who is he?

514
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:17,921
What the hell, boss?
I'm your partner, for Christ's sake.

515
00:38:18,005 --> 00:38:19,882
We just met, Chuck.

516
00:38:20,299 --> 00:38:23,886
You've been on the beat for a long time.
You've got a duty. You've got a career.

517
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:28,390
What I'm doing,
it's not exactly by the book.

518
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:32,603
I don't give a damn
about by-the-book, boss.

519
00:38:32,686 --> 00:38:35,564
I just wanna know
what the hell's going on.

520
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:42,446
When this case came over the wires,

521
00:38:43,322 --> 00:38:46,325
I requested it specifically,
you understand?

522
00:38:46,742 --> 00:38:47,951
Why?

523
00:38:50,204 --> 00:38:51,914
Andrew Laeddis,

524
00:38:52,748 --> 00:38:54,917
he was the maintenance man
in the apartment building

525
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,169
where my wife and I lived.

526
00:38:58,212 --> 00:38:59,463
Okay.

527
00:39:01,298 --> 00:39:03,342
He was also a firebug.

528
00:39:06,136 --> 00:39:08,764
Andrew Laeddis lit the match

529
00:39:11,517 --> 00:39:14,436
that caused the fire that killed my wife.

530
00:39:22,653 --> 00:39:24,112
Let them out!

531
00:39:26,782 --> 00:39:30,118
- What happened to Laeddis?
- He got away with it.

532
00:39:30,202 --> 00:39:32,621
Laeddis got away with it
and then he disappeared.

533
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:35,707
About a year ago, I open up the paper
and there he is.

534
00:39:35,791 --> 00:39:40,295
Ugly-looking son of a bitch. Huge scar
from his right temple down to his left lip.

535
00:39:40,379 --> 00:39:43,840
Eyes different colors.
Not the type of face you'd forget.

536
00:39:43,924 --> 00:39:47,052
He burned down a schoolhouse,
killed two people,

537
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:48,887
said voices told him to do it.

538
00:39:48,971 --> 00:39:51,598
First he went to prison,
then he got transferred here.

539
00:39:51,682 --> 00:39:53,892
- Then what?
- Then nothing.

540
00:39:53,976 --> 00:39:57,729
He vanished like he never existed.
No record whatsoever.

541
00:39:57,813 --> 00:40:00,190
Pretty sure he's not in Ward B.
That leaves Ward C.

542
00:40:00,274 --> 00:40:01,567
Or he could be dead.

543
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:04,236
So could Rachel Solando,
for that matter.

544
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,905
Lot of places to hide a body here.

545
00:40:07,698 --> 00:40:10,617
Only one place
no one would really notice.

546
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:26,258
That patient, Bridget Kearns,
when she sent me for water,

547
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:29,261
she said something to you back there,
didn't she?

548
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:30,470
No.

549
00:40:32,389 --> 00:40:33,682
Come on, boss.

550
00:40:37,561 --> 00:40:39,104
She wrote it.

551
00:40:54,536 --> 00:40:55,704
Boss!

552
00:40:56,038 --> 00:40:59,625
We gotta get indoors. It's turning
into a fucking Kansas out here.

553
00:40:59,708 --> 00:41:01,960
- Hold on.
- No, let's go!

554
00:41:04,838 --> 00:41:06,298
Watch out!

555
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:09,635
Jesus!

556
00:41:11,386 --> 00:41:13,680
- Come on! Up there!
- Let's go!

557
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:18,310
Get in there! Let's go!

558
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:23,148
Boss!

559
00:41:30,238 --> 00:41:32,282
- God!
- Jesus Christ!

560
00:41:33,617 --> 00:41:35,577
Damn it. God!

561
00:41:44,252 --> 00:41:47,547
- You okay, boss?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

562
00:41:54,554 --> 00:41:58,809
So if Laeddis is here,
what are you gonna do about it?

563
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:04,147
I'm not here to kill Laeddis.

564
00:42:11,822 --> 00:42:13,573
If it was my wife, I'd kill him.

565
00:42:13,657 --> 00:42:14,658
Twice.

566
00:42:25,419 --> 00:42:30,048
<i>When we got through the gates
at Dachau, the SS guards surrendered.</i>

567
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:44,312
The <i>Kommandant</i> tried to kill himself
before we got there, but he...

568
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,773
<i>He botched it.</i>

569
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:50,318
Took him an hour to die.

570
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:59,161
When I went outside,
I saw all the bodies on the ground.

571
00:43:03,623 --> 00:43:05,333
<i>Too many to count.</i>

572
00:43:32,027 --> 00:43:33,862
Too many to imagine.

573
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:38,200
So, yeah, the...

574
00:43:40,368 --> 00:43:42,287
The guards surrendered,
we took their guns,

575
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:44,289
<i>and we lined them up.</i>

576
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,627
It wasn't warfare. It was...

577
00:44:32,671 --> 00:44:34,172
It was murder.

578
00:44:37,676 --> 00:44:40,595
Yeah, I've had enough of killing.

579
00:44:43,098 --> 00:44:45,100
That's not why I'm here.

580
00:44:46,142 --> 00:44:48,186
So what is this all about?

581
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:56,111
After Laeddis vanished, I started doing
some checking on Ashecliffe.

582
00:44:57,612 --> 00:45:00,699
A lot of people know about this place,
but no one wants to talk.

583
00:45:00,782 --> 00:45:04,744
You know, it's like it...
It's like they're scared or something.

584
00:45:06,788 --> 00:45:09,875
You know, this place is funded
by a special grant

585
00:45:10,792 --> 00:45:13,628
from The House
Un-American Activities Committee?

586
00:45:13,712 --> 00:45:16,882
HUAC? And how exactly
are we fighting the communists

587
00:45:16,965 --> 00:45:19,301
from an island in Boston Harbor?

588
00:45:19,926 --> 00:45:22,554
By conducting experiments on the mind.

589
00:45:23,972 --> 00:45:25,432
At least that's my guess.

590
00:45:25,515 --> 00:45:27,225
And you think that's going on here?

591
00:45:27,309 --> 00:45:29,811
Like I said, no one would talk, right?

592
00:45:29,895 --> 00:45:32,564
Till I found somebody
who used to be a patient here.

593
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:37,027
Guy's name is George Noyce.
Nice college kid. Socialist.

594
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:39,154
He gets offered some money
to do a psych study.

595
00:45:39,237 --> 00:45:40,614
Guess what they were testing?

596
00:45:40,697 --> 00:45:41,781
Toothpaste.

597
00:45:41,865 --> 00:45:44,242
So, he starts
seeing dragons everywhere.

598
00:45:44,326 --> 00:45:49,331
He almost beats his professor to death.
Ends up here in Ashecliffe, Ward C.

599
00:45:49,998 --> 00:45:53,460
They release him after one year, right?
And what does he do?

600
00:45:53,543 --> 00:45:58,465
Two weeks on the mainland, he walks
into a bar, stabs three men to death.

601
00:45:59,257 --> 00:46:03,970
His lawyer pleads insanity, but Noyce,
he stands up in the courtroom and he...

602
00:46:04,054 --> 00:46:08,516
He begs the judge for the electric chair.
Anywhere but a mental hospital.

603
00:46:09,142 --> 00:46:11,728
Judge gives him life in Dedham Prison.

604
00:46:12,771 --> 00:46:13,813
And you found him.

605
00:46:13,897 --> 00:46:15,565
Yeah, I found him.

606
00:46:15,649 --> 00:46:18,151
Well, he's a mess.

607
00:46:19,736 --> 00:46:21,863
But it's pretty clear
from what he tells me.

608
00:46:21,947 --> 00:46:23,073
What?

609
00:46:23,156 --> 00:46:25,909
They're experimenting on people here.

610
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:27,702
I don't know, boss.

611
00:46:28,995 --> 00:46:30,497
How do you believe a crazy guy?

612
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:32,248
That's the beauty of it, isn't it?

613
00:46:32,332 --> 00:46:36,586
Crazy people, they're the perfect
subjects. They talk, nobody listens.

614
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:38,838
I stood at Dachau.

615
00:46:39,089 --> 00:46:43,760
We saw what human beings are
capable of doing to each other, right?

616
00:46:43,843 --> 00:46:46,429
For Christ's sakes, we fought
a goddamn war to stop them,

617
00:46:46,513 --> 00:46:50,266
and now... Now I find out it may be
happening here? On our soil?

618
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:51,393
No.

619
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:55,188
So what are you really here to do, Ted?

620
00:46:55,897 --> 00:46:59,693
I'm gonna get the proof,
I'm gonna go back,

621
00:46:59,776 --> 00:47:03,446
and I'm gonna blow the lid off this place.
That's it.

622
00:47:04,864 --> 00:47:06,366
Wait a minute.

623
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:09,744
You started asking around
about Ashecliffe,

624
00:47:09,828 --> 00:47:11,246
waiting for a chance to get out here,

625
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:13,915
and then suddenly
they need a U.S. Marshal?

626
00:47:13,999 --> 00:47:17,877
Yeah, I got lucky. There was a patient
escape. It was the perfect excuse.

627
00:47:17,961 --> 00:47:20,964
No, no, no, boss.
Luck doesn't work that way.

628
00:47:21,047 --> 00:47:22,716
The world doesn't work that way.

629
00:47:22,799 --> 00:47:26,094
They got an electrified fence
around a septic facility.

630
00:47:26,177 --> 00:47:29,305
Ward C is inside a Civil War fort?

631
00:47:29,389 --> 00:47:33,059
A Chief of Staff with ties to the OSS?
Funding from HUAC?

632
00:47:33,143 --> 00:47:37,731
I mean, Jesus Christ, everything about
this place stinks of government ops.

633
00:47:37,814 --> 00:47:39,190
What if they wanted you here?

634
00:47:39,274 --> 00:47:41,151
- Bullshit.
- You were asking questions.

635
00:47:41,234 --> 00:47:42,277
- Bullshit! Bullshit!
- Bullshit.

636
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:43,611
We came here for Rachel Solando.

637
00:47:43,695 --> 00:47:46,573
Where's one shred of evidence
she even existed?

638
00:47:46,656 --> 00:47:47,824
There's no way they could've known

639
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:49,284
I'd be assigned to this case.
There's no way.

640
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:52,704
What if while you were looking into
them, they were looking into you?

641
00:47:52,787 --> 00:47:55,999
All they had to do was fake an escape
to get you here, and now they have you.

642
00:47:56,082 --> 00:47:57,876
Now they have us both. Here! Now!

643
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:06,468
<i>Marshals, are you out here?
This is Deputy Warden McPherson.</i>

644
00:48:07,594 --> 00:48:08,636
<i>Marshals!</i>

645
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,722
How about that? They found us, huh?

646
00:48:10,805 --> 00:48:13,308
It's an island, boss.
They're always gonna find us.

647
00:48:14,684 --> 00:48:16,311
<i>I know you're in there.</i>

648
00:48:17,896 --> 00:48:21,399
We're getting off this goddamn island.
You and me. Come on.

649
00:48:25,779 --> 00:48:27,489
- Come on!
- Go, go!

650
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:40,418
Get dried off.
Dr. Cawley wants to talk to you now.

651
00:48:41,044 --> 00:48:44,589
And hurry up! This thing is turning
into a goddamn hurricane!

652
00:48:49,761 --> 00:48:53,681
I dropped those suits off to be cleaned.
Should be ready by tomorrow.

653
00:48:54,182 --> 00:48:56,976
That is, if we all don't wash away first.

654
00:48:57,060 --> 00:49:01,523
You know, speaking of which, I'm afraid
your smokes are pretty much done for.

655
00:49:02,107 --> 00:49:03,274
So...

656
00:49:04,943 --> 00:49:07,070
This is our only choice, huh?

657
00:49:07,153 --> 00:49:10,198
Got something really nice in
a prison gray if that don't work for you.

658
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:13,201
Now that you mention it,
these are just fine.

659
00:49:13,910 --> 00:49:15,537
That's why I must repeat my insistence

660
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:18,748
that all Ward C patients
be placed in manual restraints.

661
00:49:19,415 --> 00:49:22,752
If the facility floods, they'll drown.
You know that.

662
00:49:23,211 --> 00:49:24,462
That would take a lot of flooding.

663
00:49:24,546 --> 00:49:27,215
We're on an island in the middle
of the ocean during a hurricane.

664
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:29,968
A lot of flooding seems like
a distinct possibility.

665
00:49:30,051 --> 00:49:32,387
It's a gamble, Stephen.
Say the power fails.

666
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:33,721
There's a backup generator.

667
00:49:33,805 --> 00:49:36,516
And if that goes,
the cell doors will open.

668
00:49:38,059 --> 00:49:39,727
Where are they going to go?

669
00:49:40,395 --> 00:49:43,398
They can't just hop a ferry, scoot over
to the mainland and wreak havoc.

670
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:44,482
Oh, you're quite right.

671
00:49:44,566 --> 00:49:47,735
They're far more likely
to wreak havoc right here on us.

672
00:49:48,653 --> 00:49:51,573
If they're manacled to the floor,
they'll die.

673
00:49:51,906 --> 00:49:53,783
This is 24 human beings.

674
00:49:54,409 --> 00:49:55,743
And you can live with that, can you?

675
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:57,912
Well, frankly, if it were up to me,

676
00:49:57,996 --> 00:50:01,332
I'd put all 42 in Wards A and B
in manual restraints as well.

677
00:50:01,416 --> 00:50:04,294
- Excuse me! Excuse me.
- Marshal.

678
00:50:04,377 --> 00:50:06,921
I'm sorry, Doctor.
I just have one quick question.

679
00:50:07,005 --> 00:50:08,214
Yes, I'll be with you in a moment.

680
00:50:08,298 --> 00:50:11,301
When we spoke this morning
about Rachel Solando's note...

681
00:50:11,384 --> 00:50:13,094
"The law of four." I love that.

682
00:50:13,178 --> 00:50:16,723
...you said you had no idea what that
second line could refer to, correct?

683
00:50:17,891 --> 00:50:22,228
"Who is 67?" Yes, I'm afraid I still don't.
None of us do.

684
00:50:23,646 --> 00:50:24,898
Nothing comes to mind?

685
00:50:27,609 --> 00:50:28,818
Nothing?

686
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:37,827
Because I believe I just heard you say
there are 24 patients in Ward C

687
00:50:37,911 --> 00:50:40,371
and 42 patients in Wards A and B,

688
00:50:40,455 --> 00:50:43,917
which means there's a total of,
what, 66 patients at this facility?

689
00:50:45,585 --> 00:50:46,586
That is correct, yes.

690
00:50:50,048 --> 00:50:53,134
Well, it seems to me
Rachel Solando was suggesting

691
00:50:53,218 --> 00:50:56,346
that you have a 67th patient, Doctor.

692
00:50:57,931 --> 00:50:59,432
But I'm afraid we don't.

693
00:50:59,974 --> 00:51:01,893
This is ridiculous.
What are they doing here?

694
00:51:01,976 --> 00:51:04,145
We're doing our goddamn job.

695
00:51:04,479 --> 00:51:07,148
Didn't McPherson tell you
the good news?

696
00:51:08,316 --> 00:51:10,735
No. What's the good news, Doctor?

697
00:51:10,818 --> 00:51:12,570
Rachel's been found.

698
00:51:13,613 --> 00:51:14,989
She's here.

699
00:51:16,157 --> 00:51:17,659
Safe and sound.

700
00:51:29,337 --> 00:51:31,381
There's not a mark on her.

701
00:51:35,009 --> 00:51:36,427
Who are these men?

702
00:51:39,806 --> 00:51:41,391
Why are they in my house?

703
00:51:41,474 --> 00:51:45,979
Police officers, Rachel.
They have a few questions.

704
00:51:49,524 --> 00:51:50,692
Ma'am.

705
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:58,658
There has been a sighting of a known
communist subversive in this area,

706
00:51:58,741 --> 00:52:00,660
passing out literature.

707
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:03,663
Here?

708
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:07,500
In this neighborhood?

709
00:52:07,583 --> 00:52:09,335
Yes, I'm afraid so.

710
00:52:10,712 --> 00:52:14,299
Now if you could tell us what you did
yesterday, where you were,

711
00:52:14,382 --> 00:52:16,509
it would really help us
narrow down our search.

712
00:52:18,177 --> 00:52:19,387
Yes...

713
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:23,474
Well, I...

714
00:52:26,394 --> 00:52:29,230
I made breakfast
for Jim and the children,

715
00:52:30,898 --> 00:52:32,317
and then I

716
00:52:34,193 --> 00:52:36,404
packed Jim's lunch and he left.

717
00:52:40,074 --> 00:52:42,744
Then I sent the children off to school.

718
00:52:47,165 --> 00:52:48,416
And then

719
00:52:54,839 --> 00:52:57,884
I decided to take a long swim
in the lake.

720
00:53:04,766 --> 00:53:05,975
I see.

721
00:53:09,687 --> 00:53:11,230
And after that?

722
00:53:19,405 --> 00:53:20,740
After that,

723
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:32,168
I thought of you.

724
00:53:38,174 --> 00:53:42,136
I'm sorry, ma'am,
I don't know what you're talking about.

725
00:53:45,139 --> 00:53:48,101
Don't you know how lonely
I've been, Jim?

726
00:53:54,065 --> 00:53:55,149
You're gone.

727
00:53:59,404 --> 00:54:00,863
You're dead.

728
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:07,787
I cry every night.

729
00:54:13,793 --> 00:54:16,003
How am I supposed to survive?

730
00:54:17,505 --> 00:54:18,673
God.

731
00:54:29,058 --> 00:54:32,353
Rachel, it'll be all right.

732
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:37,650
I'm so sorry, but every...

733
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:42,196
Everything's gonna be all right. Okay?

734
00:54:44,115 --> 00:54:45,575
I buried you.

735
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:50,538
I buried an empty casket.
Your body rained down,

736
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:54,125
lumps of flesh splashing into the sea,
eaten by sharks.

737
00:54:58,379 --> 00:55:01,007
My Jim's dead,
so who the fuck are you?

738
00:55:04,427 --> 00:55:06,095
Who the fuck are you?

739
00:55:06,846 --> 00:55:07,972
- Who are you?
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

740
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:09,640
- Who are you?
- It's okay. Rachel. Rachel, it's all right.

741
00:55:09,724 --> 00:55:12,226
Let me go! No!

742
00:55:13,895 --> 00:55:16,022
- Rachel, it's okay.
- Look at me, look at me.

743
00:55:19,317 --> 00:55:22,236
I'm sorry about that.
I didn't want to interrupt.

744
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,655
I thought she might tell you something.

745
00:55:24,739 --> 00:55:28,659
We found her down by the lighthouse,
skipping stones.

746
00:55:28,743 --> 00:55:30,912
We've no idea how she got out, but...

747
00:55:30,995 --> 00:55:33,372
I'm gonna have to ask you
to go down into the basement.

748
00:55:33,456 --> 00:55:35,416
There's food, water and cots.

749
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:38,753
It's the safest place to be
when the hurricane hits.

750
00:55:43,049 --> 00:55:45,259
Are you all right? You look pale.

751
00:55:45,343 --> 00:55:47,136
I'm fine. It's just...

752
00:55:48,596 --> 00:55:50,181
Boss, are you okay?

753
00:55:51,182 --> 00:55:53,768
It's just so goddamn bright, isn't it?

754
00:55:53,851 --> 00:55:56,020
Photosensitivity, headaches sometimes.

755
00:55:56,103 --> 00:55:58,189
Marshal, are you having a migraine?

756
00:55:58,272 --> 00:55:59,941
I'll be all right.

757
00:56:02,026 --> 00:56:04,278
Come on, I got you.

758
00:56:06,072 --> 00:56:07,698
What's wrong with him?

759
00:56:07,782 --> 00:56:10,201
Take these, Marshal. Couple of hours,
you'll be as clear as a bell.

760
00:56:10,284 --> 00:56:12,286
- What's wrong with him?
- He's having a migraine.

761
00:56:12,370 --> 00:56:14,664
Imagine someone sawed open
your head, filled it with razors,

762
00:56:14,747 --> 00:56:17,458
and shook it as hard as they could.
Take the pills, Marshal.

763
00:56:17,542 --> 00:56:19,669
- I don't... I don't want the pills.
- It'll stop the pain.

764
00:56:19,752 --> 00:56:21,671
Marshal, take the pills.

765
00:56:25,633 --> 00:56:27,635
He's going to need to lie down.

766
00:56:33,307 --> 00:56:34,267
Oh, my God!

767
00:56:34,350 --> 00:56:35,685
Michael, there's broken glass
all over the floor.

768
00:56:35,768 --> 00:56:37,353
- Make sure all the meds are locked up.
- Watch your back.

769
00:56:37,436 --> 00:56:38,437
Make sure everything's okay in Ward B.

770
00:56:38,521 --> 00:56:40,022
Go down to the infirmary
and see if there's any more...

771
00:56:40,106 --> 00:56:41,232
All right, Doctor.

772
00:56:41,315 --> 00:56:45,111
Give him a bed. This one here.

773
00:56:45,194 --> 00:56:48,781
- Over here. All right, boss.
- Yeah, that's it.

774
00:56:48,864 --> 00:56:49,949
- You have him?
- Yes.

775
00:56:50,032 --> 00:56:51,284
Careful. All right.

776
00:56:53,202 --> 00:56:57,123
Could be worse right now.
He'll be all right.

777
00:57:02,169 --> 00:57:03,588
Who is that?

778
00:57:03,671 --> 00:57:06,173
Him? That's the warden.

779
00:57:08,843 --> 00:57:10,928
Don't you worry about him, all right?

780
00:57:11,012 --> 00:57:13,139
Come on. Lay back. Lay back.

781
00:57:17,226 --> 00:57:20,646
He looks like an ex-military prick, huh?

782
00:57:20,730 --> 00:57:22,690
Well, you know what?
I ain't gonna argue with you on that one.

783
00:58:49,026 --> 00:58:51,445
You should have saved me.

784
00:58:53,364 --> 00:58:55,741
You should have saved all of us.

785
00:59:24,812 --> 00:59:26,522
Hey, buddy.

786
00:59:28,774 --> 00:59:30,025
Hey.

787
00:59:30,109 --> 00:59:31,402
Laeddis.

788
00:59:33,028 --> 00:59:34,196
Yeah.

789
00:59:39,493 --> 00:59:40,578
My...

790
00:59:45,082 --> 00:59:46,167
My buddy.

791
00:59:47,626 --> 00:59:49,628
No hard feelings, right?

792
00:59:53,549 --> 00:59:54,633
Yeah.

793
00:59:56,177 --> 00:59:57,845
No hard feelings.

794
01:00:11,275 --> 01:00:13,486
A little something for later,

795
01:00:16,989 --> 01:00:19,575
'cause I know how much you need it.

796
01:00:25,790 --> 01:00:29,835
The clock's ticking, my friend.
We're running out of time.

797
01:00:40,679 --> 01:00:42,431
Give me a hand here.

798
01:01:04,703 --> 01:01:06,205
I could get into trouble.

799
01:01:34,608 --> 01:01:35,943
I'm dead.

800
01:01:38,904 --> 01:01:40,447
I'm so sorry.

801
01:01:42,116 --> 01:01:44,118
Why didn't you save me?

802
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:50,749
I tried. I wanted to, but by the time
I got there, it was too late.

803
01:02:12,855 --> 01:02:13,981
See?

804
01:02:17,318 --> 01:02:19,153
Aren't they beautiful?

805
01:03:13,916 --> 01:03:16,001
Why are you all wet, baby?

806
01:03:18,712 --> 01:03:20,381
Laeddis isn't dead.

807
01:03:21,757 --> 01:03:23,258
He isn't gone.

808
01:03:24,468 --> 01:03:26,053
He's still here.

809
01:03:28,347 --> 01:03:29,556
I know.

810
01:03:30,516 --> 01:03:34,895
You need to find him, Teddy. You need
to find him and you kill him dead.

811
01:03:52,746 --> 01:03:53,956
It's okay.

812
01:04:03,924 --> 01:04:06,677
- Security to Ward A. Okay.
- Ward A. I got it.

813
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:08,762
The generator room's flooded.

814
01:04:08,846 --> 01:04:11,098
- Ward A. Ward A.
- See what we need in Ward B.

815
01:04:11,473 --> 01:04:12,683
Let's go.

816
01:04:13,017 --> 01:04:14,560
You okay, boss?

817
01:04:17,187 --> 01:04:19,189
This goddamn migraine.

818
01:04:19,273 --> 01:04:23,152
The backup generator's failed.
The whole place has gone crazy.

819
01:04:24,903 --> 01:04:26,155
What do you want to do?

820
01:04:32,536 --> 01:04:35,539
- Christ.
- Dan? Relax. Nope, nope, nope.

821
01:04:35,622 --> 01:04:38,042
You don't wanna do that. Put it down.
Now. Put it down.

822
01:04:38,125 --> 01:04:41,712
Grab him, grab him, grab him, grab him!
Get him, get him!

823
01:04:45,716 --> 01:04:48,761
You need to go find him
'cause he needs to be here.

824
01:04:48,844 --> 01:04:51,388
You think the whole electrical system
is fried?

825
01:04:51,472 --> 01:04:54,224
I'd say it's a good possibility, yeah.

826
01:04:54,308 --> 01:04:57,352
- All the electronic security, the fences...
- Why are you always running?

827
01:04:57,436 --> 01:05:00,606
- ...the gates, the doors.
- Why is it you every time? Come on.

828
01:05:00,689 --> 01:05:04,651
Nice day for a stroll, don't you think?
To Ward C, for example.

829
01:05:07,237 --> 01:05:10,324
- Come on.
- Maybe we'll run into Andrew Laeddis.

830
01:05:15,329 --> 01:05:18,290
The guy I told you about,
George Noyce?

831
01:05:18,373 --> 01:05:21,085
He told me this is where
they keep the worst ones.

832
01:05:21,168 --> 01:05:23,796
Guys even the other inmates
are scared of.

833
01:05:25,672 --> 01:05:27,966
Did Noyce give you anything
on the layout?

834
01:05:28,050 --> 01:05:31,804
Not really. All he remembered was
people screaming day and night,

835
01:05:31,887 --> 01:05:34,598
no windows and iron bars everywhere.

836
01:05:34,681 --> 01:05:35,849
Watch your head!

837
01:05:55,869 --> 01:05:57,871
- Oh, Jesus Christ!
- Jesus.

838
01:05:58,455 --> 01:06:00,499
First time on Ward C, huh?

839
01:06:01,542 --> 01:06:03,252
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah.

840
01:06:03,335 --> 01:06:04,378
We heard stories, but...

841
01:06:04,461 --> 01:06:07,089
Trust me, son, you haven't heard shit.

842
01:06:07,548 --> 01:06:09,716
We got most of the bugsies
locked down now,

843
01:06:10,050 --> 01:06:11,969
but some of them are still loose.

844
01:06:12,052 --> 01:06:14,763
And if you see one,
don't try to restrain him yourselves.

845
01:06:14,847 --> 01:06:17,224
These fuckers will kill you. Clear?

846
01:06:18,308 --> 01:06:21,228
All right, get your asses moving then.
Go on.

847
01:07:17,951 --> 01:07:19,286
He's here.

848
01:07:23,290 --> 01:07:26,710
Laeddis. I can feel him.

849
01:07:30,964 --> 01:07:32,716
Tag! You're it!

850
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:34,801
Wait! Boss! Ted!

851
01:07:44,353 --> 01:07:46,021
Hey! Hey!

852
01:07:47,481 --> 01:07:48,649
Teddy.

853
01:08:30,607 --> 01:08:32,067
Listen to me.

854
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:36,071
Listen, I don't wanna leave here,
all right?

855
01:08:36,530 --> 01:08:38,740
I mean, why would anybody want to?

856
01:08:38,824 --> 01:08:42,286
We hear things here
about the outside world.

857
01:08:42,369 --> 01:08:45,789
- About atolls, about H-bomb tests.
- Teddy, where are you?

858
01:08:45,872 --> 01:08:47,874
You know how a hydrogen bomb works?

859
01:08:47,958 --> 01:08:51,211
- I know. With hydrogen! With hydrogen.
- Ah, that's funny.

860
01:08:51,295 --> 01:08:54,214
- Boss!
- Other bombs explode, right?

861
01:08:55,048 --> 01:08:56,633
But not the hydrogen bomb.

862
01:08:56,717 --> 01:09:02,180
It implodes, creating an explosion
to the thousandth, the millionth degree!

863
01:09:02,639 --> 01:09:04,266
- Do you get it?
- Yeah! Yeah.

864
01:09:04,349 --> 01:09:05,934
- Do you?
- I get it, I get it!

865
01:09:06,018 --> 01:09:07,269
Let him go!

866
01:09:10,897 --> 01:09:11,982
No!

867
01:09:21,241 --> 01:09:23,243
No! No!

868
01:09:24,661 --> 01:09:26,413
What are you doing?

869
01:09:26,705 --> 01:09:29,416
Jesus Christ, Teddy. Jesus!

870
01:09:29,750 --> 01:09:33,587
Oh, you got Billings. What the fuck's
the matter with you guys?

871
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:34,755
Catch them, not kill them!

872
01:09:34,838 --> 01:09:37,799
- He jumped us.
- You, give me a hand with him.

873
01:09:37,883 --> 01:09:40,302
We've gotta get him to the infirmary.
God damn it.

874
01:09:40,385 --> 01:09:44,097
No, no! Not you, not you.
Take a walk. Come on.

875
01:09:44,639 --> 01:09:47,100
Cawley's gonna have my goddamn balls
for this.

876
01:10:18,048 --> 01:10:20,258
Laeddis.

877
01:10:40,487 --> 01:10:42,072
Laeddis.

878
01:10:53,125 --> 01:10:54,876
Stop me, please,

879
01:10:55,794 --> 01:10:57,337
before I kill more.

880
01:10:59,339 --> 01:11:01,842
Stop me before I kill more.

881
01:11:02,259 --> 01:11:04,177
Laeddis.

882
01:11:12,269 --> 01:11:14,187
Please, please.

883
01:11:18,442 --> 01:11:20,402
I see you all.

884
01:11:21,153 --> 01:11:24,531
Laeddis.

885
01:11:30,871 --> 01:11:36,334
You told me I'd be free of this place.
You promised.

886
01:11:38,211 --> 01:11:39,671
You lied.

887
01:11:40,213 --> 01:11:41,548
Laeddis.

888
01:11:47,053 --> 01:11:48,388
Laeddis?

889
01:11:50,182 --> 01:11:51,892
That's pretty damn funny.

890
01:11:53,852 --> 01:11:56,396
- Your voice.
- Don't you recognize it?

891
01:11:57,689 --> 01:11:59,816
After all the talks we had?

892
01:12:00,734 --> 01:12:02,777
After all the lies you told me?

893
01:12:02,861 --> 01:12:04,654
Let me see your face.

894
01:12:05,155 --> 01:12:07,115
They say I'm theirs now.

895
01:12:08,241 --> 01:12:10,577
They say I'll never leave here.

896
01:12:11,828 --> 01:12:13,997
Your match is about to go out.

897
01:12:16,583 --> 01:12:19,336
- Let me see your goddamn face! Now!
- Why?

898
01:12:19,753 --> 01:12:23,215
So you can lie to me more?
This isn't about the truth.

899
01:12:23,298 --> 01:12:27,052
- Yes, it is. It's about exposing the truth.
- It's about you!

900
01:12:28,261 --> 01:12:32,516
And Laeddis.
That's all it's ever been about.

901
01:12:34,142 --> 01:12:37,854
I was incidental. A way in.

902
01:12:41,191 --> 01:12:45,695
George... George Noyce. No.

903
01:12:46,238 --> 01:12:48,490
It's not possible. You can't be here.

904
01:12:48,573 --> 01:12:49,950
You like it?

905
01:12:51,660 --> 01:12:53,578
Who did this to you, George?

906
01:12:53,662 --> 01:12:54,913
You did.

907
01:12:55,455 --> 01:12:56,873
What the hell do you mean?

908
01:12:56,957 --> 01:13:01,127
All your talk. All your fucking talk,
and I'm back in here because of you.

909
01:13:01,211 --> 01:13:03,797
George, how did they get you
out of Dedham, huh?

910
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:05,048
However this happened, I...

911
01:13:05,131 --> 01:13:07,092
I'm gonna find a way to fix this,
you understand me?

912
01:13:07,175 --> 01:13:11,054
I'll never get out now. I got out once.
Not twice, never twice.

913
01:13:11,137 --> 01:13:13,014
Just tell me how they got you here.

914
01:13:13,098 --> 01:13:15,809
They knew! Don't you get it?

915
01:13:16,476 --> 01:13:19,271
Everything you were up to.
Your whole plan.

916
01:13:20,063 --> 01:13:23,733
This is a game. All of this is for you.

917
01:13:24,442 --> 01:13:28,905
You're not investigating anything.
You're a fucking rat in a maze.

918
01:13:30,282 --> 01:13:33,743
Georgie... George, you're wrong.
You're wrong.

919
01:13:33,827 --> 01:13:37,956
Oh, really?
Been alone much since you got here?

920
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,668
I've been with my partner.

921
01:13:42,335 --> 01:13:44,087
You never worked with him before,
have you?

922
01:13:46,464 --> 01:13:48,883
He's a U.S. Marshal. He's...

923
01:13:48,967 --> 01:13:51,803
You never worked with him before,
have you?

924
01:13:54,598 --> 01:13:58,476
George, look, I know people.
I trust this man.

925
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:05,442
Then they've already won.

926
01:14:08,403 --> 01:14:09,529
Fuck.

927
01:14:14,284 --> 01:14:17,329
And they're gonna take me
to the lighthouse.

928
01:14:18,955 --> 01:14:20,790
They're gonna cut into my brain.

929
01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:25,629
And I'm only here because of you!

930
01:14:26,588 --> 01:14:28,965
George, I'm gonna get you out of here.

931
01:14:29,049 --> 01:14:31,301
You're not going to the lighthouse.
You're not.

932
01:14:31,384 --> 01:14:34,137
You can't dig out the truth
and kill Laeddis at the same time.

933
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:37,807
You gotta make a choice.
You understand that, don't you?

934
01:14:38,224 --> 01:14:39,976
I'm not here to kill anyone.

935
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:41,227
Liar!

936
01:14:41,311 --> 01:14:44,397
I'm not gonna kill him, I swear to you!
I swear.

937
01:14:44,648 --> 01:14:46,024
She's dead.

938
01:14:47,067 --> 01:14:48,735
She... Let her go.

939
01:14:50,236 --> 01:14:51,613
Let her go.

940
01:14:52,614 --> 01:14:55,325
Tell him, Teddy. Tell him why.

941
01:14:58,578 --> 01:15:01,247
You gotta do it. There's no other way.

942
01:15:01,873 --> 01:15:03,375
- Let her go.
- Tell him about the day

943
01:15:03,458 --> 01:15:06,336
- you brought me my locket.
- You gotta do it!

944
01:15:06,419 --> 01:15:09,839
How I told you my heart was breaking
and you asked me why.

945
01:15:09,923 --> 01:15:12,801
She's fucking with your head.

946
01:15:12,884 --> 01:15:14,761
And I told you it was from happiness.

947
01:15:14,844 --> 01:15:17,305
She's gonna kill you.
She's gonna kill you.

948
01:15:20,350 --> 01:15:23,603
You wanna uncover the truth?
You gotta let her go.

949
01:15:25,772 --> 01:15:27,440
- I can't.
- You have to let her go!

950
01:15:27,524 --> 01:15:29,401
I can't! I can't.

951
01:15:36,282 --> 01:15:38,827
Then you'll never leave this island.

952
01:15:44,582 --> 01:15:45,792
Dolores.

953
01:15:52,799 --> 01:15:54,426
He's not in this ward.

954
01:15:56,636 --> 01:15:59,639
He was transferred out of here.

955
01:16:01,808 --> 01:16:06,646
If he's not in Ward A,
there's only one place he can be.

956
01:16:12,527 --> 01:16:14,070
The lighthouse.

957
01:16:21,411 --> 01:16:22,495
Hey,

958
01:16:24,998 --> 01:16:26,499
God help you.

959
01:16:35,341 --> 01:16:39,262
Boss, we got problems. McPherson
and Cawley are in the building.

960
01:16:39,345 --> 01:16:41,097
They heard an orderly went batshit
on a patient.

961
01:16:41,181 --> 01:16:44,058
They're looking all over the place for
him and they're on their way to the roof.

962
01:16:44,142 --> 01:16:46,019
Let's get the hell out of here. This way.

963
01:16:49,022 --> 01:16:51,357
Just keep going. We belong here.

964
01:17:01,201 --> 01:17:02,994
What happened to you?

965
01:17:03,077 --> 01:17:04,704
- What do you mean?
- I mean,

966
01:17:05,079 --> 01:17:06,623
where were you?

967
01:17:06,998 --> 01:17:11,753
After we got that guy to the infirmary,
I took a little detour to patient records.

968
01:17:11,836 --> 01:17:13,963
Did you ever find Laeddis?

969
01:17:14,047 --> 01:17:15,965
No. No, I never found him.

970
01:17:16,049 --> 01:17:18,968
Well, I got the next best thing.
His intake form.

971
01:17:19,052 --> 01:17:21,179
It was the only thing in his files.
There's no session notes,

972
01:17:21,262 --> 01:17:24,974
no incident reports, no photographs,
just this. It was weird.

973
01:17:25,058 --> 01:17:26,726
Here. Take a look.

974
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:28,895
I'll look at it later.

975
01:17:30,897 --> 01:17:32,190
What's the matter, boss?

976
01:17:33,066 --> 01:17:35,568
I'll look it over later, that's all.

977
01:17:37,529 --> 01:17:40,907
- Ashecliffe's that way.
- I'm not going to Ashecliffe.

978
01:17:42,408 --> 01:17:44,369
I'm going to that lighthouse.

979
01:17:44,452 --> 01:17:46,788
I'm gonna find out what the fuck
is happening on this island.

980
01:18:00,927 --> 01:18:02,345
There it is.

981
01:18:03,179 --> 01:18:07,183
Damn. We're too far south.
We're gonna have to double back.

982
01:18:07,267 --> 01:18:09,477
There's no way we could cross
those rocks.

983
01:18:09,561 --> 01:18:11,229
There could be a way
behind those trees.

984
01:18:11,312 --> 01:18:14,399
Maybe a path that goes around the
rocks and leads over to the lighthouse.

985
01:18:14,482 --> 01:18:15,525
- Boss...
- Come on.

986
01:18:15,608 --> 01:18:17,986
Wait, wait, what are we doing?
We got the intake form.

987
01:18:18,069 --> 01:18:19,863
It's proof there's a 67th patient,

988
01:18:19,946 --> 01:18:22,782
which they said, repeatedly,
doesn't exist.

989
01:18:23,241 --> 01:18:26,452
I'm getting to that lighthouse.
You understand?

990
01:18:28,788 --> 01:18:30,498
What the hell can I say to you
to stop you?

991
01:18:30,582 --> 01:18:32,876
Why would you want to, Chuck? Why?

992
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:34,794
Because climbing down there
when it's dark

993
01:18:34,878 --> 01:18:38,047
is a thin step short of suicide,
that's why.

994
01:18:38,131 --> 01:18:41,551
Okay, maybe you better sit
this one out then.

995
01:18:43,136 --> 01:18:46,431
You brought me into this, boss,
and now we're trapped here

996
01:18:46,514 --> 01:18:50,184
on this rock, on this island,
with no one to rely on but each other,

997
01:18:50,268 --> 01:18:52,228
and now you're acting like...

998
01:18:52,312 --> 01:18:55,315
Like what? Like what? How am I acting?

999
01:19:00,153 --> 01:19:03,615
What the hell happened back there
in those cells, Ted?

1000
01:19:08,328 --> 01:19:11,581
What do you think the weather's like
in Portland, Chuck?

1001
01:19:11,664 --> 01:19:13,333
I'm from Seattle.

1002
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:17,211
Seattle.

1003
01:19:20,423 --> 01:19:23,176
I'm going on alone.

1004
01:19:26,095 --> 01:19:28,973
- I'm going with you, boss.
- I said alone.

1005
01:19:30,683 --> 01:19:31,809
Fine.

1006
01:19:58,461 --> 01:19:59,712
Damn it!

1007
01:20:00,713 --> 01:20:02,006
Damn it.

1008
01:20:07,220 --> 01:20:10,098
I knew it wouldn't take long,
but I couldn't get to it.

1009
01:20:10,181 --> 01:20:11,724
The tide was up.

1010
01:20:19,983 --> 01:20:21,109
Chuck!

1011
01:20:23,653 --> 01:20:24,821
Chuck!

1012
01:21:26,382 --> 01:21:27,633
Come on!

1013
01:22:03,002 --> 01:22:04,170
Chuck!

1014
01:22:04,754 --> 01:22:06,672
Where are you, Chuck?

1015
01:22:31,322 --> 01:22:32,532
Chuck!

1016
01:22:34,242 --> 01:22:35,409
Chuck!

1017
01:23:19,912 --> 01:23:21,289
Who are you?

1018
01:23:23,416 --> 01:23:26,252
I'm Teddy Daniels. I'm a cop.

1019
01:23:27,628 --> 01:23:29,338
You're the marshal.

1020
01:23:30,381 --> 01:23:31,799
That's right.

1021
01:23:34,135 --> 01:23:38,014
Would you mind taking your hand
from behind your back, please?

1022
01:23:38,097 --> 01:23:39,932
Why? Why?

1023
01:23:41,434 --> 01:23:44,437
I wanna make sure that
what you're holding won't hurt me.

1024
01:23:52,111 --> 01:23:53,821
I'm gonna keep this

1025
01:23:55,323 --> 01:23:56,824
if you don't mind.

1026
01:23:57,658 --> 01:23:59,076
Fine by me.

1027
01:24:08,127 --> 01:24:09,462
You're...

1028
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:12,715
You're Rachel Solando.

1029
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:15,718
The real one.

1030
01:24:19,722 --> 01:24:21,349
Did you kill your children?

1031
01:24:23,142 --> 01:24:24,977
I never had children.

1032
01:24:25,645 --> 01:24:27,438
I was never married.

1033
01:24:28,981 --> 01:24:32,526
And before I was a patient at Ashecliffe,
I worked here.

1034
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:35,738
You... You were a nurse?

1035
01:24:38,074 --> 01:24:40,034
I was a doctor, Marshal.

1036
01:24:43,454 --> 01:24:45,164
You think I'm crazy.

1037
01:24:45,539 --> 01:24:48,876
- No. No, no, I never...
- And if I say I'm not crazy?

1038
01:24:50,086 --> 01:24:52,505
Well, that hardly helps, does it?

1039
01:24:53,339 --> 01:24:55,841
That's the Kafkaesque genius of it.

1040
01:24:59,136 --> 01:25:01,430
People tell the world you're crazy,

1041
01:25:01,514 --> 01:25:05,434
and all your protests to the contrary
just confirm what they're saying.

1042
01:25:06,018 --> 01:25:09,188
I'm not following you. I'm sorry.

1043
01:25:09,814 --> 01:25:11,774
Once you're declared insane,

1044
01:25:11,857 --> 01:25:15,361
then anything you do
is called part of that insanity.

1045
01:25:15,444 --> 01:25:21,033
Reasonable protests are denial.
Valid fears, paranoia.

1046
01:25:21,117 --> 01:25:25,204
Survival instincts
are defense mechanisms.

1047
01:25:25,496 --> 01:25:29,208
You're smarter than you look, Marshal.
That's probably not a good thing.

1048
01:25:30,084 --> 01:25:31,544
Tell me something.

1049
01:25:31,627 --> 01:25:32,753
Yeah.

1050
01:25:33,921 --> 01:25:35,715
What happened to you?

1051
01:25:36,549 --> 01:25:39,969
I started asking about these
large shipments of sodium amytal

1052
01:25:40,052 --> 01:25:41,804
and opium-based hallucinogens.

1053
01:25:41,887 --> 01:25:43,597
Psychotropic drugs.

1054
01:25:44,974 --> 01:25:47,351
I asked about the surgeries, too.

1055
01:25:49,395 --> 01:25:51,564
You ever heard of
a transorbital lobotomy?

1056
01:25:53,107 --> 01:25:55,818
They zap the patient with electroshock,

1057
01:25:55,901 --> 01:25:58,738
then go through the eye with an ice pick,

1058
01:26:00,906 --> 01:26:02,992
pull out some nerve fibers.

1059
01:26:05,411 --> 01:26:07,872
Makes the patients much more obedient.

1060
01:26:07,955 --> 01:26:09,290
Tractable.

1061
01:26:10,750 --> 01:26:12,251
It's barbaric,

1062
01:26:13,252 --> 01:26:14,754
unconscionable.

1063
01:26:15,755 --> 01:26:19,508
Do you know how pain
enters the body, Marshal? Do you?

1064
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:22,219
Depends on where you're hurt?

1065
01:26:22,303 --> 01:26:27,475
No, it has nothing to do with the flesh.
The brain controls pain.

1066
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:32,480
The brain controls fear, empathy, sleep,
hunger, anger. Everything.

1067
01:26:34,815 --> 01:26:36,609
What if you could control it?

1068
01:26:37,109 --> 01:26:38,569
You mean the brain?

1069
01:26:38,652 --> 01:26:45,451
Recreate a man so he doesn't feel
pain or love or sympathy.

1070
01:26:46,911 --> 01:26:48,371
A man who can't be interrogated,

1071
01:26:48,454 --> 01:26:51,165
because he has no memories
to confess.

1072
01:26:53,751 --> 01:26:57,421
You can never take away
all a man's memories. Never.

1073
01:26:57,505 --> 01:27:01,634
Marshal, the North Koreans
used American POWs

1074
01:27:01,717 --> 01:27:03,386
during their brainwashing experiments.

1075
01:27:03,469 --> 01:27:06,889
They turned soldiers into traitors.
That's what they're doing here.

1076
01:27:06,972 --> 01:27:09,058
They're creating ghosts
to go out in the world

1077
01:27:09,141 --> 01:27:12,395
and do things sane men...
Sane men never would.

1078
01:27:12,478 --> 01:27:15,815
To have that kind of ability,
that kind of knowledge,

1079
01:27:15,898 --> 01:27:18,150
- that would take years.
- Years. Years of research.

1080
01:27:18,651 --> 01:27:21,362
Hundreds of patients to experiment on.

1081
01:27:22,613 --> 01:27:25,032
Fifty years from now,
people will look back

1082
01:27:25,116 --> 01:27:28,494
and say, here, this place,
is where it all began.

1083
01:27:29,203 --> 01:27:33,999
The Nazis used the Jews, Soviets used
prisoners in their own Gulags,

1084
01:27:34,834 --> 01:27:38,295
and we tested patients
on Shutter Island.

1085
01:27:39,964 --> 01:27:41,632
No, they won't.

1086
01:27:42,591 --> 01:27:43,592
No.

1087
01:27:46,053 --> 01:27:48,180
You do understand

1088
01:27:50,724 --> 01:27:53,018
that they can't let you leave.

1089
01:27:53,310 --> 01:27:56,647
I am a federal marshal.
They can't stop me.

1090
01:27:58,023 --> 01:28:03,112
I was an esteemed psychiatrist
from a respected family.

1091
01:28:05,197 --> 01:28:06,824
Didn't matter.

1092
01:28:09,535 --> 01:28:11,120
Let me ask you.

1093
01:28:11,203 --> 01:28:13,581
Any past traumas in your life?

1094
01:28:14,957 --> 01:28:16,208
Yes.

1095
01:28:17,376 --> 01:28:19,462
But why would that matter?

1096
01:28:19,545 --> 01:28:21,839
Because they're gonna point
to some event in your past

1097
01:28:21,922 --> 01:28:24,425
and say it's the reason
you lost your sanity.

1098
01:28:24,508 --> 01:28:29,889
So that when they commit you here,
your friends and colleagues will say,

1099
01:28:29,972 --> 01:28:31,891
"Of course he cracked.

1100
01:28:32,892 --> 01:28:34,143
"Who wouldn't after what
he'd been through?"

1101
01:28:34,226 --> 01:28:36,729
They can say that about anyone,
anyone at all.

1102
01:28:36,812 --> 01:28:39,773
The point is
they're gonna say it about you.

1103
01:28:43,027 --> 01:28:44,653
How's your head?

1104
01:28:44,737 --> 01:28:46,822
My head?

1105
01:28:46,906 --> 01:28:50,326
Any funny dreams lately?
Trouble sleeping?

1106
01:28:52,536 --> 01:28:56,874
- Headaches?
- I am prone to migraines, yes.

1107
01:28:56,957 --> 01:28:58,250
Jesus.

1108
01:29:00,544 --> 01:29:04,048
You haven't taken any pills, have you?
I mean, even aspirin?

1109
01:29:04,131 --> 01:29:06,300
- The aspirin?
- Jesus.

1110
01:29:06,967 --> 01:29:10,679
And you ate the food in the cafeteria
and drank the coffee they gave you?

1111
01:29:10,763 --> 01:29:14,141
You tell me, at least, that you've
been smoking your own cigarettes.

1112
01:29:15,935 --> 01:29:17,144
No.

1113
01:29:18,103 --> 01:29:19,230
No.

1114
01:29:20,314 --> 01:29:21,690
No, I haven't.

1115
01:29:21,774 --> 01:29:24,527
It takes 36 to 48 hours
for neuroleptic narcotics

1116
01:29:24,610 --> 01:29:27,196
to reach workable levels
in the bloodstream.

1117
01:29:28,989 --> 01:29:30,824
Palsy comes first,

1118
01:29:31,742 --> 01:29:35,204
first the fingertips,
then eventually the whole hand.

1119
01:29:36,121 --> 01:29:40,292
Seen any walking nightmares
lately, Marshal?

1120
01:29:42,795 --> 01:29:45,756
Tell me what goes on in that lighthouse.

1121
01:29:46,632 --> 01:29:47,967
Tell me.

1122
01:29:49,134 --> 01:29:50,761
Brain surgery.

1123
01:29:51,428 --> 01:29:55,891
The let's-open-the-skull-and-see-
what-happens-if-we-pull-on-this kind.

1124
01:29:56,433 --> 01:29:59,311
The learned-it-from-the-Nazis kind.

1125
01:30:01,397 --> 01:30:03,857
That's where they create the ghosts.

1126
01:30:05,276 --> 01:30:09,154
Who knows about this?
On the island, I mean. Who?

1127
01:30:11,490 --> 01:30:12,741
Everyone.

1128
01:30:12,825 --> 01:30:16,537
Come on. The nurses? The orderlies?

1129
01:30:17,121 --> 01:30:20,416
- They couldn't possibly know...
- Everyone.

1130
01:30:39,351 --> 01:30:40,894
You can't stay here.

1131
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:42,813
They think I'm dead, that I drowned.

1132
01:30:42,896 --> 01:30:45,899
I'm afraid if they come looking for you,
they might find me.

1133
01:30:45,983 --> 01:30:48,360
I'm sorry, but you have to go.

1134
01:30:54,992 --> 01:30:56,619
I'm gonna come back for you.

1135
01:30:56,702 --> 01:30:59,663
I won't be here. I move during the day.
New places every night.

1136
01:30:59,747 --> 01:31:02,082
But I could come get you,
get you off this island.

1137
01:31:02,166 --> 01:31:04,877
Haven't you heard a word I've said?

1138
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:09,089
The only way off the island is the ferry,
and they control it.

1139
01:31:09,173 --> 01:31:11,216
You'll never leave here.

1140
01:31:20,559 --> 01:31:22,353
I had a friend.

1141
01:31:22,436 --> 01:31:25,981
I was with him yesterday,
but we got separated.

1142
01:31:26,065 --> 01:31:27,733
Have you seen him?

1143
01:31:28,901 --> 01:31:30,235
Marshal,

1144
01:31:31,779 --> 01:31:33,906
you have no friends.

1145
01:32:06,230 --> 01:32:07,773
There you are.

1146
01:32:10,609 --> 01:32:13,278
We were wondering
when you'd show up.

1147
01:32:14,905 --> 01:32:16,448
Have a seat.

1148
01:32:16,907 --> 01:32:18,200
Come on.

1149
01:32:28,877 --> 01:32:31,505
Taking a leisurely stroll, were we?

1150
01:32:32,589 --> 01:32:35,634
I was just looking around.

1151
01:32:38,595 --> 01:32:41,014
Did you enjoy God's latest gift?

1152
01:32:42,641 --> 01:32:43,976
- What?
- God's gift.

1153
01:32:46,145 --> 01:32:47,479
The violence.

1154
01:32:50,315 --> 01:32:54,695
When I came downstairs in my home
and I saw that tree in my living room,

1155
01:32:54,778 --> 01:32:58,615
it reached out for me like a divine hand.

1156
01:33:00,826 --> 01:33:02,661
God loves violence.

1157
01:33:05,330 --> 01:33:08,167
- I hadn't noticed.
- Sure you have.

1158
01:33:09,334 --> 01:33:14,465
Why else would there be so much of it?
It's in us. It's what we are.

1159
01:33:16,508 --> 01:33:18,844
We wage war, we burn sacrifices,

1160
01:33:18,927 --> 01:33:21,472
and pillage and plunder
and tear at the flesh of our brothers.

1161
01:33:21,555 --> 01:33:25,476
And why? Because God gave us
violence to wage in his honor.

1162
01:33:28,687 --> 01:33:31,106
I thought God gave us moral order.

1163
01:33:31,190 --> 01:33:34,193
There's no moral order
as pure as this storm.

1164
01:33:34,818 --> 01:33:37,112
There's no moral order at all.

1165
01:33:37,404 --> 01:33:40,949
There's just this,
can my violence conquer yours?

1166
01:33:46,538 --> 01:33:48,957
- I'm not violent.
- Yes, you are.

1167
01:33:50,083 --> 01:33:52,503
You're as violent as they come.

1168
01:33:53,212 --> 01:33:56,799
I know this
because I'm as violent as they come.

1169
01:33:56,882 --> 01:33:59,051
If the constraints of society were lifted,

1170
01:33:59,134 --> 01:34:01,804
and I was all that stood
between you and a meal,

1171
01:34:01,887 --> 01:34:05,682
you would crack my skull with a rock
and eat my meaty parts.

1172
01:34:07,226 --> 01:34:08,811
Wouldn't you?

1173
01:34:11,563 --> 01:34:14,024
Cawley thinks you're harmless,
that you can be controlled,

1174
01:34:14,107 --> 01:34:15,984
but I know different.

1175
01:34:16,610 --> 01:34:18,362
- You don't know me.
- Oh, but I do.

1176
01:34:18,445 --> 01:34:21,615
- No, you don't. You don't know me at all.
- Oh, I know you.

1177
01:34:21,698 --> 01:34:24,409
We've known each other for centuries.

1178
01:34:33,752 --> 01:34:36,672
If I was to sink my teeth
into your eye right now,

1179
01:34:36,755 --> 01:34:40,092
would you be able to stop me
before I blinded you?

1180
01:34:44,221 --> 01:34:45,848
Give it a try.

1181
01:34:47,391 --> 01:34:49,101
That's the spirit.

1182
01:35:23,844 --> 01:35:26,471
Don't worry, because we're going
to get you back to your room.

1183
01:35:28,098 --> 01:35:29,766
- Not really.
- Something I've seen.

1184
01:35:29,850 --> 01:35:31,101
Okay.

1185
01:35:36,315 --> 01:35:38,066
Where have you been?

1186
01:35:38,150 --> 01:35:40,903
Oh, just wandering.
Just looking at your island.

1187
01:35:40,986 --> 01:35:44,656
Oh, I forgot you're leaving
now that Rachel's been found.

1188
01:35:45,490 --> 01:35:46,909
- Stop looking at him.
- For sure. Yeah.

1189
01:35:46,992 --> 01:35:50,245
Stop looking at him. Stop looking at him.

1190
01:35:50,329 --> 01:35:52,331
- Big meeting?
- Oh, yes.

1191
01:35:52,414 --> 01:35:54,082
- It's okay. I'm...
- I don't like that.

1192
01:35:54,166 --> 01:35:56,168
Apparently there was
an unidentified man

1193
01:35:56,251 --> 01:35:57,544
in Ward C yesterday.

1194
01:35:57,628 --> 01:36:01,006
He subdued a highly dangerous patient
quite handily.

1195
01:36:01,590 --> 01:36:02,591
Is that so?

1196
01:36:02,674 --> 01:36:05,135
It seems he had a long conversation
with a paranoid schizophrenic,

1197
01:36:05,218 --> 01:36:06,428
George Noyce.

1198
01:36:06,511 --> 01:36:09,306
Well, I don't remember
what I'm supposed to remember.

1199
01:36:09,389 --> 01:36:11,099
We're gated down. We're fine.

1200
01:36:11,183 --> 01:36:15,228
This Noyce, you said
his name was, he's delusional?

1201
01:36:15,312 --> 01:36:18,023
Extremely. He can be quite upsetting.

1202
01:36:18,106 --> 01:36:19,816
As a matter of fact, two weeks ago,

1203
01:36:19,900 --> 01:36:24,363
a patient got so wound up by one
of Noyce's stories that he beat him up.

1204
01:36:25,614 --> 01:36:27,032
Cigarette?

1205
01:36:28,825 --> 01:36:30,619
No, thanks. I quit.

1206
01:36:31,703 --> 01:36:35,749
- So you're taking the ferry?
- Yes, absolutely.

1207
01:36:35,832 --> 01:36:39,294
I think we've gotten
all we came here for, so...

1208
01:36:39,378 --> 01:36:40,712
"We," Marshal?

1209
01:36:42,714 --> 01:36:46,301
Speaking of which,
have you seen him, Doctor?

1210
01:36:46,385 --> 01:36:47,552
Who?

1211
01:36:48,387 --> 01:36:50,097
My partner, Chuck.

1212
01:36:52,432 --> 01:36:55,268
You don't have a partner, Marshal.
You came here alone.

1213
01:36:57,729 --> 01:36:59,898
You know, I've built
something valuable here,

1214
01:36:59,982 --> 01:37:03,151
and valuable things have a way of
being misunderstood in their own time.

1215
01:37:03,235 --> 01:37:05,320
Everyone wants a quick fix.
They always have.

1216
01:37:05,404 --> 01:37:08,991
I'm trying to do something that people,
yourself included, don't understand.

1217
01:37:09,074 --> 01:37:12,035
And I'm not going to give up
without a fight.

1218
01:37:13,870 --> 01:37:15,497
I can see that.

1219
01:37:19,584 --> 01:37:22,212
So, tell me again about your partner.

1220
01:37:23,922 --> 01:37:25,549
What partner?

1221
01:37:28,301 --> 01:37:29,386
It's fine.

1222
01:38:17,726 --> 01:38:21,521
She made a mess. I cleaned it up.
She made a mess again.

1223
01:38:30,822 --> 01:38:32,199
Marshal,

1224
01:38:33,575 --> 01:38:35,202
going somewhere?

1225
01:38:35,494 --> 01:38:38,663
I'm just heading out to the ferry, so...

1226
01:38:39,164 --> 01:38:42,709
Oh, well, I'm afraid it's the other way.

1227
01:38:45,670 --> 01:38:50,342
If you'll wait a moment, I'll find you
someone who can take you to the dock.

1228
01:38:55,013 --> 01:38:58,850
- What's this, Doctor? What's this?
- It's just a sedative.

1229
01:38:58,934 --> 01:39:02,104
- A precaution.
- A precaution.

1230
01:39:05,023 --> 01:39:09,111
What are you going to do?
Kill me? Marshal.

1231
01:39:09,486 --> 01:39:11,029
You think you deserve it?

1232
01:39:11,113 --> 01:39:13,907
For what? Provoking you?

1233
01:39:14,699 --> 01:39:17,536
Well, forgive me.
What doesn't provoke you?

1234
01:39:18,078 --> 01:39:21,206
- Remarks? Words?
- Nazis?

1235
01:39:21,665 --> 01:39:25,710
Well, that, too.
And, of course, memories, dreams.

1236
01:39:26,795 --> 01:39:31,049
Did you know that the word "trauma"
comes from the Greek for "wound"?

1237
01:39:31,716 --> 01:39:34,469
And what is the German word
for "dream"?

1238
01:39:38,098 --> 01:39:41,059
Wounds can create monsters,
and you...

1239
01:39:41,726 --> 01:39:44,104
You are wounded, Marshal.

1240
01:39:45,147 --> 01:39:48,316
And wouldn't you agree,
when you see a monster,

1241
01:39:49,025 --> 01:39:50,777
you must stop it?

1242
01:39:51,361 --> 01:39:52,571
Yeah.

1243
01:39:53,738 --> 01:39:55,574
- I agree.
- Yes.

1244
01:39:56,408 --> 01:39:57,492
Yeah.

1245
01:40:14,718 --> 01:40:16,970
I told him that we'd take
about an hour to do it.

1246
01:40:17,053 --> 01:40:20,140
Yeah. Did they say
we're going to do the first floor?

1247
01:40:20,223 --> 01:40:21,474
How long you been on the clock?

1248
01:40:21,558 --> 01:40:25,270
- I've been on for 18 hours straight.
- Nice paycheck.

1249
01:40:42,412 --> 01:40:44,497
What are you doing, baby?

1250
01:40:49,294 --> 01:40:51,796
- You gotta get to the ferry.
- No.

1251
01:40:52,547 --> 01:40:53,840
No, no.

1252
01:40:55,050 --> 01:40:56,218
Yeah.

1253
01:40:57,344 --> 01:41:02,224
If the world thinks that Chuck is dead,
then he's perfect for their experiments.

1254
01:41:03,308 --> 01:41:05,560
There's only one place they'd take him.

1255
01:41:08,188 --> 01:41:09,814
You go there and you'll die.

1256
01:41:09,898 --> 01:41:11,566
He's my partner. If they are hurting him,

1257
01:41:11,650 --> 01:41:14,819
if they're holding him against his will,
I've gotta bring him out.

1258
01:41:14,903 --> 01:41:16,947
I can't lose anyone else.

1259
01:41:17,030 --> 01:41:18,281
Don't go, Teddy, please.

1260
01:41:18,365 --> 01:41:21,785
- Please, don't do this. Don't go.
- I'm sorry, honey.

1261
01:41:25,372 --> 01:41:27,165
I'm sorry, honey.

1262
01:41:28,250 --> 01:41:31,294
I love this thing
because you gave it to me,

1263
01:41:33,672 --> 01:41:35,507
but the truth is

1264
01:41:37,175 --> 01:41:39,344
it is one fucking ugly tie.

1265
01:42:19,551 --> 01:42:20,719
No.

1266
01:43:42,634 --> 01:43:44,010
Don't move. Stay where you are.

1267
01:43:46,012 --> 01:43:47,430
Are you gonna kill me?

1268
01:43:49,099 --> 01:43:51,643
No, I'm not gonna kill you.

1269
01:45:44,255 --> 01:45:46,132
Why are you all wet, baby?

1270
01:45:48,343 --> 01:45:51,596
- What did you say?
- You know exactly what I said.

1271
01:46:04,692 --> 01:46:06,945
The rifle's empty, by the way.

1272
01:46:13,451 --> 01:46:14,953
Have a seat.

1273
01:46:21,459 --> 01:46:23,878
For God's sake, dry off.
You'll catch cold.

1274
01:46:25,505 --> 01:46:26,631
All right.

1275
01:46:30,176 --> 01:46:32,095
How badly did you hurt the guard?

1276
01:46:33,805 --> 01:46:36,808
I don't know what you're talking about.

1277
01:46:39,978 --> 01:46:41,896
Yes, he's here.

1278
01:46:41,980 --> 01:46:45,984
Have Dr. Sheehan take a look at
your man before you send him up.

1279
01:46:46,067 --> 01:46:50,780
So Dr. Sheehan came in
on the ferry this morning, huh?

1280
01:46:51,739 --> 01:46:53,241
Not exactly.

1281
01:46:54,284 --> 01:46:57,328
You blew up my car.
I really loved that car.

1282
01:46:58,246 --> 01:47:00,331
Sorry to hear about that.

1283
01:47:03,626 --> 01:47:06,004
Tremors are getting pretty bad.

1284
01:47:06,629 --> 01:47:09,048
How are the hallucinations?

1285
01:47:09,132 --> 01:47:11,426
Get out of here, Teddy.

1286
01:47:11,509 --> 01:47:13,303
This place is gonna be the end of you.

1287
01:47:17,056 --> 01:47:18,182
Not bad.

1288
01:47:18,266 --> 01:47:20,852
- They'll get worse.
- I know.

1289
01:47:21,728 --> 01:47:26,024
Dr. Solando,
she told me about the neuroleptics.

1290
01:47:26,566 --> 01:47:29,027
Did she, now? And when was this?

1291
01:47:29,110 --> 01:47:33,906
I found her, Doctor,
in a cave out by the cliffs.

1292
01:47:33,990 --> 01:47:35,366
But you'll never get to her.

1293
01:47:35,450 --> 01:47:38,870
I don't doubt it,
considering she's not real.

1294
01:47:41,080 --> 01:47:44,208
Your delusions are more severe
than I thought.

1295
01:47:45,418 --> 01:47:47,587
You're not on neuroleptics.

1296
01:47:48,046 --> 01:47:49,922
You're not on anything,
as a matter of fact.

1297
01:47:50,006 --> 01:47:52,634
Then what the fuck is this?
What the fuck is this?

1298
01:47:52,717 --> 01:47:53,718
Withdrawal.

1299
01:47:54,719 --> 01:47:56,679
Withdrawal? From what?

1300
01:47:56,763 --> 01:47:59,098
I haven't had a goddamn drink
since I've been on this island.

1301
01:47:59,182 --> 01:48:00,808
Chlorpromazine.

1302
01:48:01,643 --> 01:48:05,313
I'm not a fan of pharmacology,
but I have to say, in your case...

1303
01:48:05,396 --> 01:48:08,650
- Chloraproma-what?
- Chlorpromazine.

1304
01:48:08,733 --> 01:48:12,737
The same thing we've been giving you
for the past 24 months.

1305
01:48:14,030 --> 01:48:16,157
So for the past two years, you...

1306
01:48:16,240 --> 01:48:19,535
You've had somebody slipping me drugs
in Boston. Is that it?

1307
01:48:19,619 --> 01:48:21,079
Not Boston.

1308
01:48:21,579 --> 01:48:22,747
Here.

1309
01:48:23,539 --> 01:48:27,502
You've been here for two years.
A patient of this institution.

1310
01:48:31,255 --> 01:48:35,009
After everything I've seen here, Doctor,

1311
01:48:35,093 --> 01:48:38,513
you really think you're gonna
convince me I'm crazy?

1312
01:48:38,596 --> 01:48:40,556
Do you know the kind of people
that I deal with every day?

1313
01:48:40,640 --> 01:48:42,517
I'm a U.S. Marshal, for God's sakes.

1314
01:48:42,600 --> 01:48:44,477
You were a U.S. Marshal.

1315
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:48,356
Here's a copy of the intake form
you broke into Ward C for.

1316
01:48:48,439 --> 01:48:49,816
Proof of the 67th patient.

1317
01:48:49,899 --> 01:48:51,067
If you'd gotten it to the mainland,

1318
01:48:51,150 --> 01:48:52,944
you could have
blown the lid off this place.

1319
01:48:53,027 --> 01:48:54,153
Wait. Where did... Where did you...

1320
01:48:54,237 --> 01:48:56,030
Yet somehow,
you couldn't find time to look at it.

1321
01:48:56,114 --> 01:48:57,824
Well, read it now.

1322
01:48:58,282 --> 01:48:59,659
Go ahead.

1323
01:49:03,454 --> 01:49:07,291
"Patient is highly intelligent, highly
delusional decorated Army veteran.

1324
01:49:07,375 --> 01:49:11,129
"Present for the liberation of Dachau.

1325
01:49:11,212 --> 01:49:13,840
"Former U.S. Marshal.
Known proclivity for violence.

1326
01:49:13,923 --> 01:49:17,176
"Shows no remorse for his crime
because he denies the crime ever...

1327
01:49:17,260 --> 01:49:18,302
"Ever took place.

1328
01:49:18,386 --> 01:49:20,263
"Highly developed
and fantastical narratives,

1329
01:49:20,346 --> 01:49:22,724
"which preclude facing
the truth of his actions."

1330
01:49:22,807 --> 01:49:23,891
I've had enough of this bullshit!

1331
01:49:23,975 --> 01:49:27,854
Where's my partner? Where's Chuck?
Where is he?

1332
01:49:27,937 --> 01:49:29,647
Let's try this another way.

1333
01:49:29,731 --> 01:49:32,275
Your wife's maiden name was Chanal,
am I correct?

1334
01:49:32,358 --> 01:49:33,776
Don't you even talk about her.
Don't you...

1335
01:49:33,860 --> 01:49:35,737
I'm afraid I have to.

1336
01:49:37,822 --> 01:49:42,034
Notice anything these four names
have in common? It's your rule of four.

1337
01:49:42,118 --> 01:49:43,244
Andrew, what do you see?

1338
01:49:43,327 --> 01:49:46,330
If you've done anything to my partner,
Doctor, that is a violation of...

1339
01:49:46,414 --> 01:49:48,833
Focus, Andrew! What do you see?

1340
01:49:49,834 --> 01:49:52,336
The names have the same letters.

1341
01:49:53,212 --> 01:49:56,632
Edward Daniels has exactly
the same 13 letters as Andrew Laeddis.

1342
01:49:56,716 --> 01:49:58,926
The same as Rachel Solando
and Dolores Chanal.

1343
01:49:59,010 --> 01:50:01,095
The names are anagrams
for each other.

1344
01:50:01,179 --> 01:50:03,765
Your tactics,
they're not gonna work on me.

1345
01:50:03,848 --> 01:50:06,642
You came here for the truth. Here it is.

1346
01:50:06,726 --> 01:50:08,728
Your name is Andrew Laeddis.

1347
01:50:08,811 --> 01:50:12,356
The 67th patient at Ashecliffe
is you, Andrew.

1348
01:50:14,192 --> 01:50:15,151
Bullshit.

1349
01:50:15,234 --> 01:50:17,445
You were committed here by court order
24 months ago.

1350
01:50:17,528 --> 01:50:20,865
Your crime is terrible,
one you can't forgive yourself for,

1351
01:50:20,948 --> 01:50:23,326
so you invented another self.

1352
01:50:25,495 --> 01:50:26,913
All right.

1353
01:50:27,413 --> 01:50:30,082
Let's get down to the facts, all right?

1354
01:50:30,166 --> 01:50:33,044
You've created a story
in which you're not a murderer.

1355
01:50:33,127 --> 01:50:35,171
You're a hero, still a U.S. Marshal,

1356
01:50:35,254 --> 01:50:37,173
only here at Ashecliffe
because of a case,

1357
01:50:37,256 --> 01:50:40,593
and you've uncovered a conspiracy
so that anything we tell you

1358
01:50:40,676 --> 01:50:44,514
about who you are, what you've done,
you can dismiss as lies, Andrew.

1359
01:50:44,597 --> 01:50:45,890
My name is Edward Daniels.

1360
01:50:45,973 --> 01:50:50,228
I've been hearing this fantasy for
two years now. I know every detail.

1361
01:50:50,311 --> 01:50:52,271
Patient 67, the storm,

1362
01:50:52,355 --> 01:50:55,566
Rachel Solando, your missing partner,
the dreams you have every night.

1363
01:50:55,650 --> 01:50:58,069
You were at Dachau,
but you may not have killed any guards.

1364
01:51:02,114 --> 01:51:05,785
I wish I could let you just live
in your fantasy world.

1365
01:51:05,868 --> 01:51:07,328
I really do.

1366
01:51:08,204 --> 01:51:10,414
But you're violent, trained, dangerous.

1367
01:51:10,498 --> 01:51:12,792
You're the most dangerous patient
we have.

1368
01:51:12,875 --> 01:51:15,169
You've injured orderlies, guards,
other patients.

1369
01:51:15,253 --> 01:51:17,171
Two weeks ago,
you attacked George Noyce.

1370
01:51:17,255 --> 01:51:19,507
No, no. I am fucking on to you, Doctor.

1371
01:51:19,590 --> 01:51:21,467
- You had Noyce beaten.
- Of course I didn't!

1372
01:51:21,551 --> 01:51:23,636
Give me one reason
why I would even touch him!

1373
01:51:23,719 --> 01:51:26,097
Because he called you Laeddis,

1374
01:51:26,180 --> 01:51:29,225
and you'd do anything not to be him.

1375
01:51:29,308 --> 01:51:32,895
I have a transcript of the conversation
you had with Noyce yesterday.

1376
01:51:32,979 --> 01:51:37,024
"This is about you, and, Laeddis,
that's all it's ever been about."

1377
01:51:38,943 --> 01:51:41,445
No, no. He's saying
this is about me and Laeddis.

1378
01:51:41,529 --> 01:51:43,406
When you asked him
what happened to his face,

1379
01:51:43,489 --> 01:51:46,868
he said, now here I'm quoting again,
"You did this."

1380
01:51:46,951 --> 01:51:49,078
No, no, he meant that it was my fault.

1381
01:51:49,161 --> 01:51:51,163
You almost killed him.

1382
01:51:52,832 --> 01:51:55,626
The warden and the Board of Overseers
are determined something be done.

1383
01:51:55,710 --> 01:51:57,420
It's been decided

1384
01:51:57,503 --> 01:52:02,133
that unless we can bring you
back to sanity now, right now,

1385
01:52:02,216 --> 01:52:05,636
permanent measures will be taken to
ensure you can't hurt anyone ever again.

1386
01:52:09,140 --> 01:52:12,476
They'll lobotomize you, Andrew.
Do you understand?

1387
01:52:16,731 --> 01:52:18,649
Yeah, I understand.

1388
01:52:19,483 --> 01:52:21,694
I understand just fine.

1389
01:52:22,320 --> 01:52:26,407
If I don't play along
with your little game here,

1390
01:52:26,490 --> 01:52:29,619
Dr. Naehring's gonna turn me
into one of his ghosts.

1391
01:52:30,077 --> 01:52:31,454
But what about my partner?

1392
01:52:31,537 --> 01:52:36,000
You gonna tell the U.S. Marshal's office
that he's a defense mechanism?

1393
01:52:37,877 --> 01:52:39,337
Hello, boss.

1394
01:52:56,187 --> 01:52:58,981
What the fuck is going on here?

1395
01:53:01,859 --> 01:53:05,488
You working for him?

1396
01:53:06,322 --> 01:53:07,823
I'm sorry. There wasn't any other way.

1397
01:53:07,907 --> 01:53:10,826
Someone had to stick with you,
keep you safe.

1398
01:53:13,704 --> 01:53:15,831
You been watching me, huh?

1399
01:53:16,791 --> 01:53:18,876
Watching me every minute.

1400
01:53:19,794 --> 01:53:22,797
Who are you? Who are you? Tell me.

1401
01:53:23,589 --> 01:53:25,591
Don't you recognize me, Andrew?

1402
01:53:27,009 --> 01:53:30,721
I've been your primary psychiatrist
for the last two years.

1403
01:53:31,305 --> 01:53:33,182
I'm Lester Sheehan.

1404
01:53:39,647 --> 01:53:42,316
- I told you... I told you about my wife, I...
- I know.

1405
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:45,653
I climbed down a cliff to get you.
I trusted you.

1406
01:53:45,736 --> 01:53:49,365
I risked everything to come
in here after you. Everything!

1407
01:53:49,448 --> 01:53:50,491
I know, boss.

1408
01:53:50,574 --> 01:53:53,369
We're running out of time here, Andrew.

1409
01:53:53,744 --> 01:53:55,329
I swore before the Board of Overseers

1410
01:53:55,413 --> 01:53:59,333
that I could construct the most radical,
cutting-edge role-play

1411
01:53:59,417 --> 01:54:01,669
ever attempted in psychiatry,
and it would bring you back.

1412
01:54:01,752 --> 01:54:04,797
I thought that if we let you play this out

1413
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:08,509
we could get you to see
how untrue, how impossible it is.

1414
01:54:09,593 --> 01:54:12,054
You've had the run of the place
for two days.

1415
01:54:12,138 --> 01:54:15,433
Tell me, where are
the Nazi experiments?

1416
01:54:15,516 --> 01:54:17,309
The satanic ORs?

1417
01:54:30,948 --> 01:54:32,825
Andrew, listen to me.

1418
01:54:35,202 --> 01:54:37,455
If we fail with you,

1419
01:54:37,538 --> 01:54:41,459
then everything that we've tried to do
here will be discredited. Everything.

1420
01:54:43,586 --> 01:54:46,756
We're on the front lines
of a war here, old boy.

1421
01:54:47,506 --> 01:54:50,384
And right now, it all comes down to you.

1422
01:54:57,308 --> 01:55:00,019
- Don't move! Don't move!
- Andrew! Andrew! No. No.

1423
01:55:00,102 --> 01:55:03,314
My name is Edward Daniels!

1424
01:55:03,397 --> 01:55:05,441
This one's loaded.
I can tell by the weight.

1425
01:55:05,524 --> 01:55:08,110
I see. And that's your firearm, Marshal?
You're sure?

1426
01:55:08,194 --> 01:55:09,403
My initials are on the side.

1427
01:55:09,487 --> 01:55:11,781
There's a dent in the barrel
from when Philip Stacks shot at me.

1428
01:55:11,864 --> 01:55:13,991
You're not gonna fuck with my mind
on this one, Doctor!

1429
01:55:14,075 --> 01:55:15,117
Then blast away.

1430
01:55:15,201 --> 01:55:18,537
Because that's the only way
you're ever getting off this island.

1431
01:55:24,627 --> 01:55:26,504
Andrew, please don't.

1432
01:55:37,389 --> 01:55:38,682
My gun.

1433
01:55:45,272 --> 01:55:47,858
What did you do to my goddamn gun?

1434
01:55:48,275 --> 01:55:49,443
It's a toy, Andrew.

1435
01:55:52,947 --> 01:55:55,032
We're telling you the truth.

1436
01:55:55,533 --> 01:55:58,786
Dolores was insane,
manic-depressive, suicidal.

1437
01:55:59,453 --> 01:56:02,540
You drank, stayed away,
ignored what everyone told you.

1438
01:56:02,623 --> 01:56:03,749
You moved to that lake house

1439
01:56:03,833 --> 01:56:06,961
after she purposely set
your city apartment on fire.

1440
01:56:07,044 --> 01:56:08,337
- You were...
- You're lying.

1441
01:56:08,420 --> 01:56:11,882
- Andrew! Andrew, stop. No.
- You drugged the cigarettes!

1442
01:56:11,966 --> 01:56:13,801
- All you've done is lie!
- Andrew. Andrew.

1443
01:56:13,884 --> 01:56:17,096
Your children. Andrew, your children.

1444
01:56:17,179 --> 01:56:19,849
Simon. Henry.

1445
01:56:20,224 --> 01:56:21,517
I never had any children.

1446
01:56:21,600 --> 01:56:25,646
Your wife drowned them
at the cabin by the lake.

1447
01:56:25,729 --> 01:56:28,941
And here, the little girl,
the one you dream of

1448
01:56:29,650 --> 01:56:31,318
every night.

1449
01:56:31,402 --> 01:56:32,570
I never had a little girl.

1450
01:56:32,653 --> 01:56:36,240
The one who tells you over and over
that you should have saved her,

1451
01:56:36,323 --> 01:56:38,242
saved them all.

1452
01:56:38,325 --> 01:56:40,786
Your daughter, her name was Rachel.

1453
01:56:40,870 --> 01:56:43,747
Are you going to deny
that she ever lived?

1454
01:56:44,498 --> 01:56:46,250
Andrew, are you?

1455
01:57:09,231 --> 01:57:11,317
I'm so sorry, baby.

1456
01:57:15,696 --> 01:57:18,073
I told you not to come in here.

1457
01:57:18,532 --> 01:57:22,494
I told you this would be the end of you.

1458
01:57:42,848 --> 01:57:44,183
I'm back!

1459
01:57:44,808 --> 01:57:47,561
We got him just outside of Oklahoma.

1460
01:57:47,645 --> 01:57:50,189
Must've stopped 10 places
in between here and Tulsa.

1461
01:57:50,272 --> 01:57:52,358
I could sleep for a week.

1462
01:57:56,320 --> 01:57:57,655
Dolores?

1463
01:58:04,536 --> 01:58:05,871
Dolores?

1464
01:58:10,668 --> 01:58:12,962
<i>And he said, "Take up your bed
and walk." But God?</i>

1465
01:58:13,045 --> 01:58:14,088
Dolores?

1466
01:58:14,171 --> 01:58:18,259
<i>Then he said, "Take up your bed
and walk." Forgive sins, but God?</i>

1467
01:58:28,519 --> 01:58:29,895
Dolores?

1468
01:58:55,212 --> 01:58:56,463
Baby,

1469
01:58:58,507 --> 01:59:00,384
why are you all wet?

1470
01:59:02,720 --> 01:59:04,263
I missed you.

1471
01:59:11,645 --> 01:59:13,314
I wanna go home.

1472
01:59:16,442 --> 01:59:17,943
You are home.

1473
01:59:23,115 --> 01:59:24,950
Where are the kids?

1474
01:59:28,996 --> 01:59:30,748
They're in school.

1475
01:59:34,918 --> 01:59:36,920
It's Saturday, honey.

1476
01:59:38,088 --> 01:59:40,299
School's not in on Saturday.

1477
01:59:42,926 --> 01:59:44,553
My school is.

1478
01:59:57,900 --> 01:59:59,443
Oh, my God.

1479
02:00:01,737 --> 02:00:03,197
Oh, my God!

1480
02:00:16,335 --> 02:00:19,046
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1481
02:00:23,217 --> 02:00:24,802
Oh, my God, no.

1482
02:00:29,264 --> 02:00:30,974
Come on, come on.

1483
02:00:44,196 --> 02:00:47,324
No. No. Please, God.

1484
02:00:49,326 --> 02:00:53,122
Please, God, no! No!

1485
02:00:56,333 --> 02:00:57,459
No.

1486
02:01:02,965 --> 02:01:04,091
No.

1487
02:01:06,593 --> 02:01:07,845
No.

1488
02:01:52,222 --> 02:01:53,432
Baby.

1489
02:02:12,242 --> 02:02:14,745
Let's put them at the table, Andrew.

1490
02:02:15,579 --> 02:02:18,790
We'll dry them off.
We'll change their clothes.

1491
02:02:20,959 --> 02:02:23,086
They'll be our living dolls.

1492
02:02:27,424 --> 02:02:30,177
Tomorrow we can take them on a picnic.

1493
02:02:35,182 --> 02:02:39,686
If you ever loved me, Dolores,
please stop talking.

1494
02:02:46,276 --> 02:02:47,778
I love you.

1495
02:02:56,495 --> 02:02:58,080
Set me free.

1496
02:03:02,751 --> 02:03:04,169
Oh, baby.

1497
02:03:07,631 --> 02:03:09,550
We'll give them baths.

1498
02:03:12,803 --> 02:03:16,014
- I love you, baby.
- I love you, too.

1499
02:03:16,098 --> 02:03:17,891
- I love you so much.
- I love you so much.

1500
02:03:17,975 --> 02:03:19,726
I love you. I...

1501
02:03:43,584 --> 02:03:45,335
Oh, baby.

1502
02:03:51,300 --> 02:03:52,634
Andrew.

1503
02:03:54,678 --> 02:03:56,680
Andrew, can you hear me?

1504
02:03:56,972 --> 02:03:58,307
Rachel.

1505
02:03:59,182 --> 02:04:00,851
Rachel, Rachel.

1506
02:04:03,103 --> 02:04:04,396
Rachel?

1507
02:04:06,898 --> 02:04:08,358
Rachel who?

1508
02:04:11,236 --> 02:04:13,322
Rachel. Rachel Laeddis.

1509
02:04:14,489 --> 02:04:16,241
My daughter.

1510
02:04:19,828 --> 02:04:21,580
Why are you here?

1511
02:04:24,791 --> 02:04:26,335
Because I killed my wife.

1512
02:04:26,418 --> 02:04:28,545
And why did you do that?

1513
02:04:32,049 --> 02:04:35,218
Because she murdered our children,

1514
02:04:38,138 --> 02:04:39,556
and she told me to let her go.

1515
02:04:43,727 --> 02:04:46,897
- Who's Teddy Daniels?
- He doesn't exist.

1516
02:04:49,232 --> 02:04:51,693
Neither does Rachel Solando.
I made them up.

1517
02:04:51,777 --> 02:04:53,028
Why?

1518
02:04:54,363 --> 02:04:56,531
We need to hear you say it.

1519
02:05:02,329 --> 02:05:05,540
After she tried to kill herself
the first time,

1520
02:05:07,584 --> 02:05:09,544
Dolores told me she...

1521
02:05:10,504 --> 02:05:14,758
She had an insect living
inside her brain.

1522
02:05:16,760 --> 02:05:21,473
She could feel it
clicking across her skull,

1523
02:05:21,556 --> 02:05:25,769
just pulling the wires just for fun.

1524
02:05:29,439 --> 02:05:31,233
She told me that.

1525
02:05:32,693 --> 02:05:35,529
She told me that, but I didn't listen.

1526
02:05:39,241 --> 02:05:41,535
I loved her so much, you know.

1527
02:05:42,953 --> 02:05:45,122
Why did you make them up?

1528
02:05:47,207 --> 02:05:51,128
Because I can't take knowing
that Dolores killed our children.

1529
02:05:54,965 --> 02:05:56,299
And I...

1530
02:05:58,802 --> 02:06:03,306
I killed them 'cause I didn't get her help,
you know.

1531
02:06:07,519 --> 02:06:09,146
I killed them.

1532
02:06:13,942 --> 02:06:15,068
Here's my fear, Andrew.

1533
02:06:15,152 --> 02:06:18,363
We broke through once before,
nine months ago,

1534
02:06:18,447 --> 02:06:19,448
and then you regressed.

1535
02:06:21,992 --> 02:06:25,328
- I don't remember that.
- I know.

1536
02:06:26,830 --> 02:06:28,623
You reset, Andrew.

1537
02:06:29,082 --> 02:06:33,170
Like a tape playing over and over
on an endless loop.

1538
02:06:34,421 --> 02:06:35,881
I hope that what we've done here
will be enough

1539
02:06:35,964 --> 02:06:39,092
to stop it from ever happening again,

1540
02:06:39,176 --> 02:06:42,679
but I need to know
you've accepted reality.

1541
02:06:49,186 --> 02:06:51,938
You came after me, huh, Doctor?

1542
02:06:53,815 --> 02:06:57,694
You tried to help me
when no one else would.

1543
02:07:09,498 --> 02:07:12,375
My name's Andrew Laeddis,

1544
02:07:19,382 --> 02:07:22,844
and I murdered my wife
in the spring of '52.

1545
02:07:47,577 --> 02:07:51,039
- How we doing this morning?
- Good.

1546
02:07:51,122 --> 02:07:54,042
- And you?
- Can't complain.

1547
02:08:03,718 --> 02:08:07,681
- So what's our next move?
- You tell me.

1548
02:08:13,270 --> 02:08:17,566
We gotta get off this rock, Chuck.
Get back to the mainland.

1549
02:08:17,649 --> 02:08:20,610
Whatever the hell's going on here,
it's bad.

1550
02:08:42,549 --> 02:08:45,760
Don't worry, partner,
they're not gonna catch us.

1551
02:08:51,308 --> 02:08:54,144
That's right. We're too smart for them.

1552
02:08:55,270 --> 02:08:57,397
Yeah, we are, aren't we?

1553
02:09:13,038 --> 02:09:15,790
You know,
this place makes me wonder...

1554
02:09:16,333 --> 02:09:18,418
Yeah, what's that, boss?

1555
02:09:19,377 --> 02:09:21,338
Which would be worse,

1556
02:09:22,172 --> 02:09:26,301
to live as a monster
or to die as a good man?

1557
02:09:36,144 --> 02:09:37,437
Teddy?
