No one knows Xander.
No one even met him.

00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,398
Apparently, he had a proxy

with the company.

Well, if he did, he certainly
would have made a note of it.

of that building again?

Wayne Plaza.

341
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,981
He was a meticulous note taker, Thomas.

342
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,230
He organized everything by project.

343

to meet him alone.

353
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:06,802
I'm starting to think he isn't just
some recluse hiding from the world.

354
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,352
He's hiding from Jerome.

Apologies, Mr. Wilde,

It's understandable.
You can call me Jeremiah.

That's name my mother gave me.

You solved her murder,

396

and Captain Gordon, I owe you
a debt of gratitude for that,

and for putting Jerome in Arkham,
where he belongs.

398
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:01,620
He never mentioned you before.

399
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:07,042
No, I suppose you wouldn't know
from the letters my mother sent me,

400
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:09,173
he never spoke of me after I left.

401
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:11,088
Left where?

402
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:13,886
The Circus.

403
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,594
They hid me away to protect me from him.

See, we are always different,
Jerome and I.

405
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:24,567
From an early age, I showed
a proficiency for maths and design

406
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:27,145
and Jerome, mainly the mutilation
of alley cats.

On my 10th birthday,
he held a cake knife to my throat.

408
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:32,784
A few weeks later,
he lit my bed on fire.

409
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,702
It was like living in a nightmare.

410
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,827
My mother knew, eventually,
one day he would succeed, so...

411
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:41,709
One night, my uncle came to my room
while Jerome slept

412
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:43,919
and told me that he was taking me away.

413
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:46,168
I had no idea where,

414
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:50,002
but I kissed my mother goodbye,

415
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:54,006
told her I love her,
and I never saw her again.

But in my heart,

419
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,312
I knew one day Jerome would come for me.

420
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,777
Well, that day is today, pops.

421
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,989
GORDON: We have reason to believe
Jerome knows where you are.

422
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:16,661
We need to move you to a safe location

423
00:24:16,747 --> 00:24:17,988
until we can apprehend him.

424
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:19,539
That won't be necessary, gentlemen.

425
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:22,038
I've spent the bulk of my life
preparing for this eventuality.

426
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,540
I am safest here in my home.

427
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:27,915
Not anymore.
Jerome knows the name of your proxy.

428
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:30,295
He got it from your boss
just before he executed him.

429
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:32,961
I heard about Jerome
visiting Alan Hayes.

430
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:34,762
It's tragic.

431
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:38,808
But the proxy's name
I gave to Alan was a fake.

You're lying.

There's something about this guy
that's fishy.

00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:50,679
Join me, and we will find him.

(COUGHING)

655
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:02,061
I thought I was going to be
stuck like this forever.

656
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:06,195
You don't have to be, friend.

657
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,786
Okay. I'll join you.

658
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,542
But you'd better deliver.

659
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:21,914
And I'm not your friend.

660
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,010
I can live with those terms.

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

662
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,824
Why did you open your club
in The Narrows?

663
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:01,287
You could've set up shop
anywhere in Gotham.

664
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:04,210
You wanted my attention.

665
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:06,967
I came back here
because the people love me.

666
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:09,090
People didn't come here
because they love you, Ed,

667
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,546
they came for the money.

668
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:15,600
But I can give them what they want.
I just need your help.

669
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:18,304
Why would I help you?

670
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:23,150
Because I know what you really want.

671
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:26,938
You love me.

672
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,365
You've loved me all along.

673
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:34,237
You're wrong.

674
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:36,239
That was Ed.

675
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:40,034
Okay.

676
00:39:40,837 --> 00:39:42,044
So, do it.

677
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:45,380
Kill me.

What's your record for how many banks
you've robbed in one day?

680
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:03,940
Three. Why?

681
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:05,980
I think you can do better.

682
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:08,775
You're playing a dangerous game, Lee.

683
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:10,439
I know.

It's all right. Come on.

00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:48,477
- Captain.
- It's okay.

687
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:51,818
This is Jeremiah Valeska,
Jerome's twin brother.

688
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:54,525
We need to put him
into protective custody.

689
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:56,781
Okay. Follow me.

690
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:01,661
Thank you.

691
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:06,749

if it weren't for you.

What are you thinking?

695
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:23,054
GORDON: Jerome told his brother
his plan was to turn Gotham mad.

696
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:25,894
How the hell
is he going to do that, Harvey?

The test subject has arrived.

Hmm.

709
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:04,849
A little large for a test subject,
don't you think?

710
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:08,182
He is not your test subject.
This is Grundy.

711

He will make a welcome addition
to the team.

Nice to meet you, big fellow.
