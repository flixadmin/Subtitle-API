1
00:00:02,462 --> 00:00:03,630
<i>In 2166,</i>

2
00:00:03,797 --> 00:00:05,882
<i>an immortal tyrant named Vandal Savage</i>

3
00:00:06,049 --> 00:00:08,677
<i>conquered the world
and murdered my wife and child.</i>

4
00:00:08,843 --> 00:00:10,053
<i>I have assembled an elite team</i>

5
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:13,098
<i>to hunt him throughout time
and stop his rise to power.</i>

6
00:00:13,264 --> 00:00:17,268
<i>Unfortunately, my plan is opposed
by the body I had sworn my allegiance to,</i>

7
00:00:17,435 --> 00:00:18,728
<i>the Time Masters.</i>

8
00:00:18,895 --> 00:00:20,980
<i>In the future,
my friends may not be heroes,</i>

9
00:00:21,147 --> 00:00:22,607
<i>but if we succeed,</i>

10
00:00:22,857 --> 00:00:25,652
<i>they will be remembered as legends.</i>

11
00:00:28,238 --> 00:00:30,358
<i>Previously,
on</i> Legends of Tomorrow...

12
00:00:30,407 --> 00:00:32,367
You need to learn to embrace
your human side.

13
00:00:32,534 --> 00:00:35,304
And what if that side of me is gone?
What if she doesn't exist anymore?

14
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:36,608
No, this is a dictatorship.

15
00:00:36,663 --> 00:00:39,332
You get to call all the shots,
and I get to take all the shots.

16
00:00:39,499 --> 00:00:41,543
<i>The most powerful evil
the world has ever known</i>

17
00:00:41,751 --> 00:00:43,878
has just gone red
at the height of the Cold War.

18
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:45,255
Valentina Vostok.

19
00:00:45,422 --> 00:00:47,674
<i>She's trying to build a Soviet Firestorm.</i>

20
00:00:47,841 --> 00:00:50,736
Your comrade here tells me you know
quite a bit about this project of mine.

21
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,971
You're hanging us all out to dry, Rip.
I need backup.

22
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:54,889
<i>Half the team is gone.</i>

23
00:00:55,598 --> 00:00:56,918
I'm gonna remember that, comrade.

24
00:00:56,975 --> 00:01:00,061
You and Dr. Vostok
have much work to do in the morning.

25
00:01:01,938 --> 00:01:05,024
Incredible. This is the exact formula

26
00:01:05,316 --> 00:01:08,027
for the thermocore that's needed
to build a new Firestorm.

27
00:01:08,278 --> 00:01:11,990
How did you manage to arrive at something
that took decades to produce?

28
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:15,744
But here's what I don't understand.
The Firestorm matrix is unstable.

29
00:01:16,202 --> 00:01:19,539
The thermocore reacts exponentially
to the rate of fission in the host body.

30
00:01:19,748 --> 00:01:20,832
Fortunately,

31
00:01:21,708 --> 00:01:26,713
Dr. Wells developed a Quantum Splicer
to address that very problem.

32
00:01:28,923 --> 00:01:32,844
I'm so happy to see that
you're taking an interest in my work.

33
00:01:33,052 --> 00:01:34,471
<i>What can I say, sir?</i>

34
00:01:34,637 --> 00:01:36,389
Nuclear physics is my passion.

35
00:01:38,683 --> 00:01:39,809
"Sir?"

36
00:01:40,769 --> 00:01:43,646
The Cisco I know
never dwelled on formality.

37
00:01:45,648 --> 00:01:48,193
What's more, your hair is different,

38
00:01:48,568 --> 00:01:49,778
your wardrobe neat,

39
00:01:49,986 --> 00:01:51,946
your comportment gentlemanly.

40
00:01:52,238 --> 00:01:53,782
Yeah, you like?

41
00:01:54,032 --> 00:01:55,909
I just subscribed to <i>GQ.</i>

42
00:01:58,703 --> 00:02:00,371
A snide attempt at humor.

43
00:02:00,872 --> 00:02:02,540
Almost Cisco-like.

44
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:04,334
Almost.

45
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,461
What are you implying?

46
00:02:06,669 --> 00:02:09,422
What I am stating, unequivocally, sir,

47
00:02:10,507 --> 00:02:12,550
is that you are not Cisco.

48
00:02:13,384 --> 00:02:17,138
Which means, I am not in S.T.A.R. Labs.

49
00:02:17,889 --> 00:02:22,268
Furthermore, I will never,
never give you the formula.

50
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:33,446
Bravo, Professor Stein.

51
00:02:39,536 --> 00:02:42,497
What cocktail of hallucinogens
have you given me, Doctor?

52
00:02:42,705 --> 00:02:43,915
Don't worry.

53
00:02:44,374 --> 00:02:47,418
I would never dream of damaging
that beautiful mind of yours.

54
00:02:47,877 --> 00:02:49,420
I simply want to open it.

55
00:02:50,213 --> 00:02:53,675
Finish the formula
and these little games of ours can stop.

56
00:02:54,217 --> 00:02:56,261
You'll never trick me
into giving out my research.

57
00:02:56,594 --> 00:02:58,596
And since you also cannot kill me

58
00:02:58,763 --> 00:03:02,183
and destroy any hope
of creating a Soviet Firestorm,

59
00:03:02,392 --> 00:03:05,895
I would like a hot shower
and a change of clothes.

60
00:03:07,313 --> 00:03:10,108
And I thought I gave a good speech.

61
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:14,737
I'm sorry, have we met?

62
00:03:14,904 --> 00:03:20,034
Eleven years ago, you bought
a nuclear warhead off me in Norway.

63
00:03:20,952 --> 00:03:25,081
And then you and your time-traveling
friends tried to kill me.

64
00:03:25,415 --> 00:03:27,959
Just like me, you haven't aged a day.

65
00:03:29,168 --> 00:03:30,795
I have a good hairdresser.

66
00:03:34,007 --> 00:03:38,511
In my long life, I have met some of
the most skilled interrogators in history.

67
00:03:38,678 --> 00:03:41,014
But since we are in the Soviet Union,

68
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:44,601
let me tell you a story
about a friend of mine,

69
00:03:45,143 --> 00:03:46,561
Joseph Stalin.

70
00:03:47,228 --> 00:03:50,064
He became quite skilled at breaking a man.

71
00:03:50,815 --> 00:03:54,444
Carefully aimed strikes to
the bridge of the nose,

72
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:59,824
along the shoulder blades
and right underneath the chin.

73
00:04:02,577 --> 00:04:04,287
Stalin gave me this

74
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:06,581
as a gift.

75
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:09,292
So it's to be torture, then.

76
00:04:10,752 --> 00:04:11,836
Get on with it.

77
00:04:12,921 --> 00:04:13,963
No.

78
00:04:14,631 --> 00:04:17,592
Nothing so prosaic for you, Professor.

79
00:04:18,217 --> 00:04:20,887
There are infinite ways to break a man,

80
00:04:21,471 --> 00:04:24,098
and I have an infinite amount of time.

81
00:04:25,183 --> 00:04:28,686
Firestorm is my life's work.

82
00:04:29,145 --> 00:04:33,149
I will never allow you to pervert it
in pursuit of global conquest.

83
00:04:40,698 --> 00:04:43,034
This is going to be so much fun.

84
00:04:54,379 --> 00:04:56,798
<i>Jefferson. Jefferson.</i>

85
00:04:57,882 --> 00:05:00,343
Jax? What are you doing in here?

86
00:05:01,803 --> 00:05:03,388
Hey, are you all right?

87
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,475
Yeah, I...

88
00:05:07,892 --> 00:05:10,186
I haven't been able to sleep
the past two nights.

89
00:05:10,353 --> 00:05:12,939
<i>I prescribed Mr. Jackson
some mild medication.</i>

90
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:15,358
Which don't seem to be doing a damn thing.

91
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:16,943
What's wrong?

92
00:05:17,652 --> 00:05:20,196
It's Stein.
They've started in on him again.

93
00:05:20,655 --> 00:05:22,407
He's scared to death. I can feel it.

94
00:05:22,615 --> 00:05:25,368
- He's trying to be strong, but...
- We're gonna get him back.

95
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:26,661
Ray and Rory too.

96
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:29,455
I'm sure Captain Hunter has a plan.

97
00:05:30,081 --> 00:05:32,000
It's my fault he got captured.

98
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:35,145
If he wasn't trying to protect me,
he would have never gone in there alone.

99
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:38,339
It's gonna be okay, Jax, I promise.

100
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:42,060
Well, you don't know what kind of place
they've got him locked up in.

101
00:05:42,093 --> 00:05:43,553
<i>Labor Camp Number 54,</i>

102
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:46,347
<i>formerly known as the Koshmar
or Nightmare Gulag.</i>

103
00:05:46,556 --> 00:05:47,724
<i>Built in the 18th century...</i>

104
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:51,269
Can we skip past the Wikipedia crap
and get to the good stuff,

105
00:05:51,477 --> 00:05:53,062
like how to break in?

106
00:05:54,272 --> 00:05:57,233
Perhaps you didn't register that
as a question, Gideon?

107
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,484
<i>I understood.</i>

108
00:05:58,651 --> 00:06:01,696
<i>But in its 200 years of operation,
no one has successfully escaped...</i>

109
00:06:01,863 --> 00:06:05,783
No offense, Gideon, but I never met
a building I couldn't break into.

110
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,190
<i>Well, I hope you're right.</i>

111
00:06:07,285 --> 00:06:09,078
Savage knows that Stein created Firestorm,

112
00:06:09,245 --> 00:06:10,925
but if he finds out that he is Firestorm...

113
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,291
It's always Savage with you, isn't it?

114
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:15,710
My partner's in prison, too.

115
00:06:16,044 --> 00:06:17,420
- And Ray.
- Yeah, whatever.

116
00:06:17,587 --> 00:06:19,147
The point is, you didn't lift a finger.

117
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:22,425
You know damn well it was never my
intention to get them thrown into a gulag.

118
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:23,801
But I had no other option.

119
00:06:23,968 --> 00:06:25,988
Besides, I doubt that
it's Mr. Rory's first time in prison.

120
00:06:26,012 --> 00:06:27,430
Or second or, I imagine, tenth.

121
00:06:27,597 --> 00:06:31,142
All right, arguing is not gonna
bring the team back any faster.

122
00:06:31,309 --> 00:06:32,435
<i>And Rip's right.</i>

123
00:06:32,685 --> 00:06:34,896
Criminals usually do feel
more at home in prison.

124
00:06:35,104 --> 00:06:37,607
And they know it better than anyone else.

125
00:06:37,815 --> 00:06:38,858
So...

126
00:06:39,025 --> 00:06:40,693
So, what if the key to breaking in

127
00:06:40,902 --> 00:06:44,238
is asking someone who's been in and out
of Soviet prisons their whole life?

128
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:45,948
And who might that be?

129
00:06:46,324 --> 00:06:47,909
Are you familiar with the Bratva?

130
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,953
Ooh, the Russian mob.

131
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:54,248
In 1986, they would have ruled
the criminal underground

132
00:06:54,415 --> 00:06:56,209
inside every prison.

133
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:03,466
Your tattoo.

134
00:07:04,342 --> 00:07:08,763
It stands for <i>"Menia Ispravit Rasstrel, "</i>
if I'm not mistaken.

135
00:07:09,597 --> 00:07:13,184
In English, it translates to,
"Execution will reform me."

136
00:07:13,935 --> 00:07:15,770
What brings you to the <i>banya,</i> little man?

137
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:17,522
The name's Rip.

138
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:20,691
I understand that you are familiar
with the Koshmar Gulag.

139
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,401
We need to break into that prison.

140
00:07:22,568 --> 00:07:25,530
And can you make it fast?
I despise the heat.

141
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,699
A man by the name of Vandal Savage
runs his secret operation out of it.

142
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:31,619
A prison within a prison, if you will.

143
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:33,830
I have heard of this Savage.

144
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:38,501
He has no respect for my country's
rich criminal traditions.

145
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:40,253
So you'll help us?

146
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,880
You men have no tattoos.

147
00:07:43,214 --> 00:07:46,509
And a man who has no life story
cannot be trusted.

148
00:07:46,843 --> 00:07:48,302
Igor! Andrei!

149
00:07:57,687 --> 00:07:59,480
Don't all volunteer at once.

150
00:08:02,066 --> 00:08:05,027
Igor and Andrei
seem to be a bit preoccupied.

151
00:08:05,611 --> 00:08:08,030
Now about that gulag...

152
00:08:08,865 --> 00:08:10,199
No matter.

153
00:08:10,741 --> 00:08:13,953
In this life, a man fights for himself.

154
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:17,999
Perhaps you'd like this one?

155
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:19,500
He's all yours.

156
00:08:39,812 --> 00:08:42,982
So you like having Vandal Savage run
his evil empire from your country?

157
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,322
As much as a pig enjoys being
Christmas dinner.

158
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:58,289
Help us, and we will destroy
his entire operation.

159
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:07,590
I just took out six men.
You guys couldn't handle one?

160
00:09:08,341 --> 00:09:11,344
- You killed my men?
- They're not dead, yet.

161
00:09:11,594 --> 00:09:13,930
And neither are you, assuming you help us.

162
00:09:15,765 --> 00:09:18,684
My organization runs
black market goods into Koshmar.

163
00:09:19,143 --> 00:09:24,315
Three of our, well, comrades
are being held there by Savage.

164
00:09:24,482 --> 00:09:27,026
Koshmar is not a hotel
for petty criminals.

165
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:29,570
If your friends are there,

166
00:09:30,029 --> 00:09:33,491
they must be insane, ruthless animals.

167
00:09:35,368 --> 00:09:37,328
Hey. Howdy.

168
00:09:37,787 --> 00:09:39,747
- How you doing?
- What the hell are you doing?

169
00:09:39,956 --> 00:09:41,249
Just being friendly.

170
00:09:41,874 --> 00:09:43,501
This must be where they keep the VIPs.

171
00:09:43,668 --> 00:09:46,170
This is prison, jackass.
There are no VIPs.

172
00:09:46,754 --> 00:09:48,523
<i>Some of these guys
have been here for a while.</i>

173
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:50,387
Hey, maybe this guy
can tell us where Stein is.

174
00:09:53,803 --> 00:09:55,489
The only thing you should be
worrying about, pretty,

175
00:09:55,513 --> 00:09:56,639
is lasting the night.

176
00:09:57,014 --> 00:10:00,810
- Stein needs help, he's in real trouble.
- News flash, so are we.

177
00:10:09,902 --> 00:10:11,696
Think they'll bring us blankets later?

178
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:18,494
Now, according to Yuri,
this is where his men have access.

179
00:10:18,661 --> 00:10:19,662
Got it?

180
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:22,581
- This isn't my first prison break.
- We've got it covered.

181
00:10:22,957 --> 00:10:24,125
So, how can we help?

182
00:10:24,292 --> 00:10:26,669
By staying on the ship.
We don't need any more casualties.

183
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:28,438
Besides, Mr. Snart and Sara
have got it covered...

184
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:29,463
Man...

185
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,900
Why does it feel like we're
on the JV team all of a sudden?

186
00:10:31,924 --> 00:10:33,718
What you are, is one half of everything

187
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:35,928
Savage needs to change
the face of the Cold War.

188
00:10:36,304 --> 00:10:38,597
And you are the only person
who can kill him.

189
00:10:38,764 --> 00:10:40,766
- Yes, so you can't...
- I am not going to gift-wrap

190
00:10:41,017 --> 00:10:43,352
the two people in the world
that Savage wants the most.

191
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:44,770
We should get going.

192
00:10:46,272 --> 00:10:48,232
Ms. Lance, could I borrow you
for a moment?

193
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,901
I have something that might help you out
with the mission.

194
00:10:56,282 --> 00:10:58,617
So, what did you really want
to talk to me about?

195
00:11:00,077 --> 00:11:01,996
Gideon, will you please show Ms. Lance

196
00:11:02,246 --> 00:11:05,624
the projection of 2016,
should our rescue mission fail.

197
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:06,834
<i>I'd be happy to, Captain.</i>

198
00:11:10,421 --> 00:11:13,424
So this is what will happen to Russia
if we don't get Stein back?

199
00:11:13,591 --> 00:11:14,925
Not Russia.

200
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,470
This is Star City.

201
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,264
The rest of the world
doesn't look much better.

202
00:11:22,183 --> 00:11:23,267
That's impossible.

203
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:26,270
Not if Stein creates
a stable Firestorm for the Soviets.

204
00:11:26,437 --> 00:11:29,357
Here in 1986, they are already
perilously close to creating a prototype.

205
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:30,941
Listen to me, Sara, everything,

206
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:33,611
everything we've tried to achieve
so far could be lost.

207
00:11:33,903 --> 00:11:36,197
And not only will my family die
150 years from now,

208
00:11:36,364 --> 00:11:38,532
but your family, your city,

209
00:11:39,784 --> 00:11:42,453
your entire 21st century
world will suffer.

210
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:50,711
That's why we're going to get Stein back
before Vostok can break him.

211
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,962
Well, I hope so.

212
00:11:52,213 --> 00:11:54,090
But we need a contingency plan.

213
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:57,218
What are you saying?

214
00:11:57,385 --> 00:11:59,625
I'm saying that if at any point
throughout the operation,

215
00:11:59,762 --> 00:12:02,056
it becomes clear that Martin is

216
00:12:03,307 --> 00:12:04,934
beyond our reach...

217
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:08,354
You want me to kill Stein.

218
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:22,243
Impressive, how many weapons
you can fit in that outfit.

219
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:28,165
And how much stupidity
Raymond can squeeze into this one.

220
00:12:28,374 --> 00:12:31,001
The plan is to save him, too.
Not just Stein and your partner.

221
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,837
I'm gonna save Raymond, all right.

222
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,548
So I can beat some sense into him.

223
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:37,425
And what about you?

224
00:12:37,675 --> 00:12:38,884
What about me?

225
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:41,887
Clearly, I'm not the only one
with a side-mission.

226
00:12:42,513 --> 00:12:45,182
What did Rip keep you after class
to talk about?

227
00:12:45,391 --> 00:12:48,269
He just wanted to go over
a few details of the plan.

228
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:51,605
He wants you to take out the old man,
doesn't he?

229
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:55,359
It's the obvious play.
It's also heartless.

230
00:12:55,568 --> 00:12:57,027
The plan is to save Stein.

231
00:12:57,862 --> 00:13:00,364
And if, for whatever reason, we can't,

232
00:13:01,365 --> 00:13:05,744
Rip showed me what will happen
to my home in 2016, to our families.

233
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:08,622
If Stein breaks,
the damage is irreversible.

234
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:11,542
I've been on a lot of heists.

235
00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:15,212
And even when things got rough,
I never took out one of my own.

236
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,256
Well, this isn't a bank heist.

237
00:13:17,423 --> 00:13:19,300
First, he left my partner
twisting in the wind,

238
00:13:19,467 --> 00:13:22,094
now he's gonna have you
ice old silver-top?

239
00:13:22,928 --> 00:13:24,722
We're all just pawns, Sara.

240
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:27,475
Come on, I'm the crook,
you're the assassin.

241
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:29,143
He's not just asking me to kill.

242
00:13:29,393 --> 00:13:30,895
He's asking me to save the future,

243
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:33,564
and if for whatever reason
we can't save Stein,

244
00:13:33,898 --> 00:13:35,900
then I'm gonna do what needs to be done.

245
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,447
It's just like scout camp.

246
00:13:41,906 --> 00:13:43,491
Man, the food was terrible.

247
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:45,662
There was one time they gave us
Salisbury steak.

248
00:13:45,743 --> 00:13:47,077
You ever stop talking?

249
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:52,750
What I wouldn't give
for a little Salisbury steak now.

250
00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:00,257
Hey, Ray Palmer.

251
00:14:00,466 --> 00:14:01,592
Put your hand down.

252
00:14:02,301 --> 00:14:04,321
He might know
where Vostok is keeping the Professor.

253
00:14:04,345 --> 00:14:05,763
Shut up and eat.

254
00:14:06,305 --> 00:14:08,950
Do you know if there's any other place
where they keep prisoners here?

255
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:10,684
We're looking for a friend.

256
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:12,436
There is a place.

257
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:15,105
They send you there
and you never come back.

258
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:17,358
You can hear the screams all night.

259
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:19,527
This place, where is it?

260
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:23,656
Who said you could eat?

261
00:14:25,282 --> 00:14:26,325
Hey.

262
00:14:26,659 --> 00:14:28,118
He's not hurting anybody.

263
00:14:28,494 --> 00:14:31,121
Who is this American
with the pretty teeth?

264
00:14:31,622 --> 00:14:34,124
Must be a comedian.

265
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,085
I'm sure we can handle this like adults.

266
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,857
I brought you
something to eat, Professor.

267
00:14:59,567 --> 00:15:02,486
If this is a bribe, I politely decline.

268
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:08,826
So stubborn, so proud, so American.

269
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:11,434
You've already built a thermocore,
so just build another one.

270
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:14,999
It'll only take you eight to 10 years.

271
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:16,250
You thought that, what?

272
00:15:16,417 --> 00:15:19,503
Your friends stealing the thermocore
would save the West?

273
00:15:27,344 --> 00:15:29,513
As if I would only build one.

274
00:15:34,518 --> 00:15:36,520
We're so close, Professor.

275
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:39,815
All I need to learn now is
how to stabilize the thermocore

276
00:15:40,024 --> 00:15:42,693
and my dream of creating a Nuclear Man
will be achieved.

277
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,028
To what end?

278
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:46,030
If you launch a Soviet Firestorm,

279
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:48,216
the United States
will have no choice but to retaliate.

280
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,742
Both countries will be annihilated.

281
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:52,578
And out of the ashes,
we will rise stronger.

282
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,872
Just as we did when the Nazis invaded.

283
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:56,832
But America is weak.

284
00:15:57,207 --> 00:16:01,086
With your Big Mac, MTV,
movie star president.

285
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:05,716
Do you really think Vandal Savage
cares about the Cold War?

286
00:16:06,342 --> 00:16:08,469
He's just using you, Doctor.

287
00:16:09,595 --> 00:16:12,848
Do not think of insulting
Mr. Savage in front of me.

288
00:16:15,726 --> 00:16:16,894
Hey, what's wrong?

289
00:16:17,061 --> 00:16:18,354
Something's changed.

290
00:16:18,562 --> 00:16:20,189
Grey thinks we've abandoned him.

291
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:22,066
He's starting to lose it in there.

292
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:23,359
I can't take this.

293
00:16:23,525 --> 00:16:25,402
We've got to tell Rip.

294
00:16:25,569 --> 00:16:27,404
The guy who benched us?

295
00:16:27,738 --> 00:16:29,531
He'll just tell us to sit tight.

296
00:16:29,865 --> 00:16:31,742
You know, I hate feeling so helpless.

297
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:34,703
This is exactly what it was like
when I blew out my knee.

298
00:16:34,912 --> 00:16:36,952
I could barely walk,
the recruiters stopped calling,

299
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:38,165
my mom always crying.

300
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,919
I just wish there was something
I could do.

301
00:16:42,086 --> 00:16:43,253
Wait.

302
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:46,423
Your connection with Stein,
it goes both ways, right?

303
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:49,426
- Yeah.
- So, maybe we can send him a signal.

304
00:16:50,928 --> 00:16:54,264
Grey did tell me about this one time
he and Ronnie...

305
00:16:55,099 --> 00:16:57,309
Get a knife. You need to cut me.

306
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:01,480
Tell me how to stabilize Firestorm.

307
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:05,109
If Einstein had the opportunity,
he would have traveled back in time

308
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:07,653
to prevent the creation
of the atomic bomb.

309
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:10,406
How can I, in good conscience,
lead the world to the invention

310
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:12,783
of something far more destructive?

311
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:14,410
You don't really have a choice.

312
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:17,121
This toxin, it's not lethal.

313
00:17:18,122 --> 00:17:20,416
But it'll make you wish that it were.

314
00:17:24,253 --> 00:17:25,629
Are you sure about this?

315
00:17:38,142 --> 00:17:39,518
<i>So, Professor,</i>

316
00:17:42,813 --> 00:17:46,358
would you like to talk
or would you prefer to scream?

317
00:17:48,152 --> 00:17:50,237
Do your worst, Doctor.

318
00:18:13,802 --> 00:18:16,805
Hey, Pyro, what was that there
back in the yard?

319
00:18:17,014 --> 00:18:19,057
Just your typical prison alpha.

320
00:18:19,224 --> 00:18:21,810
He didn't like you
threatening his reputation.

321
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:25,147
Not that, I mean, you sitting there
while I was getting my ass kicked.

322
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:26,565
None of my business.

323
00:18:27,191 --> 00:18:30,569
None of your business?
None of your business? We're...

324
00:18:31,195 --> 00:18:32,321
Supposed to be a team.

325
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:34,656
The only team I'm on is mine and Snart's.

326
00:18:34,823 --> 00:18:37,493
Besides, you had that beat-down coming.

327
00:18:38,243 --> 00:18:42,080
Oh, well, I can't sit back and watch
an old man get pushed around.

328
00:18:42,498 --> 00:18:44,541
Then you're a bigger fool than I thought.

329
00:18:50,047 --> 00:18:51,715
These are the ones I want.

330
00:18:58,096 --> 00:18:59,556
Remember me?

331
00:19:13,362 --> 00:19:15,197
Identification papers.

332
00:19:19,368 --> 00:19:20,994
Yuri the Bear sent me.

333
00:19:30,629 --> 00:19:32,256
Remember, we get Stein first.

334
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:33,982
And if the plan fails, you'll kill him.

335
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:35,968
- You want my advice?
- No.

336
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:37,469
Don't use your gun.

337
00:19:37,636 --> 00:19:40,973
Do it with your hands, do it while
you're looking right into Stein's eyes.

338
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:42,408
You're talking about a member of our team.

339
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:44,632
I just don't want you to forget
who we're talking about.

340
00:19:52,693 --> 00:19:53,694
Thank you.

341
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:57,239
<i>Valentina has failed to make you talk.</i>

342
00:19:57,656 --> 00:19:58,907
Now, it's my turn.

343
00:20:05,414 --> 00:20:06,623
Colonel,

344
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,084
let's begin.

345
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:24,933
So, are you still planning...

346
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,853
What did you threaten before,
"To go all <i>Rocky IV</i> on my ass"?

347
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:29,887
I've changed my mind.

348
00:20:34,318 --> 00:20:37,154
Ivan Drago lives at the end of the movie.

349
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:54,963
Isn't he supposed to
ask us some questions?

350
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:56,757
They don't care what we got to say.

351
00:20:57,591 --> 00:20:59,343
We're just part of the show.

352
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:00,719
Stein?

353
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,513
Professor, we're okay.

354
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:05,724
Don't tell these bastards anything.

355
00:21:10,938 --> 00:21:13,982
If you think I have
a sentimental attachment to them,

356
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:17,361
you are as foolish as you are mad.

357
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:20,447
You held up longer than expected.

358
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:27,704
But if 4,000 years of life
has taught me one thing,

359
00:21:27,871 --> 00:21:29,331
it is patience.

360
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:35,837
- When I get out of here...
- There is your mistake.

361
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:37,714
Thinking that you will get out of here.

362
00:21:38,632 --> 00:21:39,800
Hey.

363
00:21:40,092 --> 00:21:41,885
Can we get some water in here?

364
00:21:42,386 --> 00:21:44,429
Something to drink? I'm a little thirsty.

365
00:21:44,805 --> 00:21:47,599
A sandwich would be nice.
A little turkey and mayo?

366
00:21:49,017 --> 00:21:50,894
They have mayo in Russia?

367
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,521
No?

368
00:21:53,981 --> 00:21:56,233
At least in America you get a last meal.

369
00:21:56,817 --> 00:21:58,652
Communism really sucks.

370
00:21:59,778 --> 00:22:01,655
What are you doing, Boy Scout?

371
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:04,908
Yes, Boy Scout, what are you doing?

372
00:22:06,368 --> 00:22:08,870
Nothing compared to what I did
to your mother last night.

373
00:22:09,037 --> 00:22:10,789
You have quite a mouth on you.

374
00:22:10,956 --> 00:22:12,499
So does she.

375
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,797
Enough. You're killing him.

376
00:22:18,964 --> 00:22:19,965
That's it?

377
00:22:20,132 --> 00:22:22,132
But the Colonel will think
that we're cheating him.

378
00:22:22,175 --> 00:22:25,554
I'll tell you how to stabilize Firestorm.
Just let them live.

379
00:22:25,721 --> 00:22:26,763
Please.

380
00:22:28,682 --> 00:22:30,934
So, how does it feel to be dead again?

381
00:22:31,101 --> 00:22:32,519
Take the next left.

382
00:22:34,021 --> 00:22:36,106
You can't be down here, comrade.

383
00:22:36,273 --> 00:22:39,109
I was ordered to take this corpse
to the incinerator.

384
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:41,319
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

385
00:22:41,486 --> 00:22:45,115
Dr. Vostok used him
for one of her smallpox weapons trials.

386
00:22:47,576 --> 00:22:49,202
Highly contagious.

387
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:03,967
All right, this duct
should take us to solitary.

388
00:23:04,134 --> 00:23:06,011
- We get to Stein...
- Yeah, I'm not going.

389
00:23:06,178 --> 00:23:07,304
That's the plan.

390
00:23:07,471 --> 00:23:11,683
That's Rip's plan. My priority is Mick.

391
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:15,979
Fine. Forget it.
So much for your code, crook.

392
00:23:16,146 --> 00:23:17,314
Anytime, assassin.

393
00:23:19,858 --> 00:23:21,902
Of all the dumb things
I've seen in my life,

394
00:23:22,069 --> 00:23:24,905
you getting that guy to beat on you
takes the cake.

395
00:23:25,072 --> 00:23:26,490
You're welcome.

396
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:29,367
You think you proved something back there?

397
00:23:29,534 --> 00:23:32,996
- I proved I wasn't scared.
- You proved you'd make a great pinata.

398
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:35,248
<i>He could have beaten you to death.</i>

399
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:38,210
There are some things
that are more important than survival.

400
00:23:38,376 --> 00:23:41,171
Like standing up for what you believe in.

401
00:23:42,047 --> 00:23:43,173
Your principles.

402
00:23:44,257 --> 00:23:45,509
Your team.

403
00:23:46,384 --> 00:23:48,512
Must be something
you're willing to die for.

404
00:23:49,221 --> 00:23:50,889
The perfect score.

405
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:58,772
The only difference between us is
how we define score.

406
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:03,860
<i>I'm sorry to inform you, Captain.</i>

407
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:06,571
<i>The probability of the United States
losing the Cold War</i>

408
00:24:06,738 --> 00:24:08,532
<i>has risen to 99%.</i>

409
00:24:08,698 --> 00:24:12,869
<i>Star City, the seat of the resistance,
is predicted to fall in 2003.</i>

410
00:24:13,036 --> 00:24:14,496
Come on, Sara.

411
00:24:22,045 --> 00:24:24,840
You mentioned the Quantum Splicer
earlier, Professor.

412
00:24:25,006 --> 00:24:27,151
Your friends are counting on you
to make the right decision.

413
00:24:27,175 --> 00:24:28,385
I have eyes on Stein.

414
00:24:28,552 --> 00:24:29,928
The future is cementing.

415
00:24:30,095 --> 00:24:32,848
You must extract Stein
before he enters the lab.

416
00:24:40,063 --> 00:24:41,690
Move! Kill her!

417
00:24:47,821 --> 00:24:49,573
<i>What's happening, Miss Lance?</i>

418
00:24:49,739 --> 00:24:51,241
I couldn't rescue Stein.

419
00:24:51,408 --> 00:24:52,928
<i>Have they moved him into the lab?</i>

420
00:24:53,034 --> 00:24:56,746
<i>Yeah, where Savage has every guard
in the gulag watching him.</i>

421
00:24:56,913 --> 00:24:58,498
Well, if that's the case...

422
00:24:59,249 --> 00:25:00,834
I know what I have to do.

423
00:25:05,964 --> 00:25:09,634
The formula for stabilizing
Firestorm, Professor.

424
00:25:10,135 --> 00:25:12,262
This may surprise you,

425
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:15,974
but in my youth, I longed to visit Russia.

426
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:19,186
I was obsessed by your culture.

427
00:25:19,978 --> 00:25:22,731
Rachmaninoff, Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy...

428
00:25:23,064 --> 00:25:24,774
Stop stalling.

429
00:25:25,317 --> 00:25:28,945
It's a shame I never got to see it
before the collapse.

430
00:25:30,405 --> 00:25:33,283
What sort of nonsense
are you talking about?

431
00:25:33,909 --> 00:25:38,955
In 1991, your economy fails
and your empire crumbles.

432
00:25:39,414 --> 00:25:41,458
But the truth is, the world is better off.

433
00:25:41,917 --> 00:25:45,253
In my time, crooks and thieves
rule your country,

434
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,297
<i>desperate to hang on to power</i>

435
00:25:47,464 --> 00:25:50,217
and the riches they divide
amongst their cronies.

436
00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:54,262
My country is by no means perfect,

437
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:58,475
<i>but at least we are free to
criticize our government,</i>

438
00:25:59,309 --> 00:26:01,228
vote in fair elections,

439
00:26:02,145 --> 00:26:03,813
and love whom we choose.

440
00:26:04,731 --> 00:26:07,317
I, uh, hate to break this
to you, Dr. Vostok,

441
00:26:08,109 --> 00:26:11,029
you are on the wrong side of history.

442
00:26:13,114 --> 00:26:14,366
For now.

443
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:20,413
But you will help us change history.

444
00:26:22,332 --> 00:26:23,667
Proceed.

445
00:26:24,334 --> 00:26:27,921
Gideon, are you able to detect
the Professor's life functions remotely?

446
00:26:28,088 --> 00:26:30,382
<i>Yes, Captain.
His pulse is still strong.</i>

447
00:26:30,757 --> 00:26:32,133
Well, not for much longer.

448
00:26:32,425 --> 00:26:35,178
Rip, Jax and I need to talk to you.

449
00:26:35,345 --> 00:26:38,765
- Now is really not a good time.
- Yeah, this will only take a minute.

450
00:26:39,933 --> 00:26:41,893
I know you think you can't risk losing us,

451
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,687
but that's assuming we'd fail.

452
00:26:43,853 --> 00:26:45,146
And we won't.

453
00:26:46,231 --> 00:26:47,691
I'm not afraid anymore.

454
00:26:48,108 --> 00:26:49,234
I can do this.

455
00:26:49,526 --> 00:26:52,195
And I don't got to be Firestorm
to be a part of this team.

456
00:26:52,362 --> 00:26:55,699
Look, I am not prepared
to risk anyone else.

457
00:26:55,865 --> 00:26:57,701
- Ever since...
- Carter?

458
00:26:58,118 --> 00:27:00,704
- His death wasn't your fault.
- I know.

459
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:03,081
But Stein's will be.

460
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:05,917
All I got to do is touch him
and we can fly out of there.

461
00:27:06,084 --> 00:27:08,479
Yeah, once you've scaled a 50-foot fence
topped with razor wire,

462
00:27:08,503 --> 00:27:09,838
gotten past eight sharpshooters,

463
00:27:10,005 --> 00:27:12,966
and entered a gulag full of the most
dangerous criminals in the USSR.

464
00:27:13,591 --> 00:27:14,843
Okay, so...

465
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:18,471
You create a distraction and
I'll fly Jax in and no one will see us.

466
00:27:19,597 --> 00:27:23,518
Listen, you're playing chess
without all your pieces on the board.

467
00:27:25,395 --> 00:27:26,604
Maybe you're right.

468
00:27:28,315 --> 00:27:29,524
So that's a yes?

469
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:36,406
You call that a flame?

470
00:27:37,574 --> 00:27:39,617
- Ah, nice costume.
- Got one for you, too.

471
00:27:39,784 --> 00:27:40,910
Ah.

472
00:27:42,037 --> 00:27:45,373
Wakey, wakey. Time to shrink. Or not.

473
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,167
- Let's go.
- What about him?

474
00:27:47,334 --> 00:27:48,814
We can't ditch him. He won't survive.

475
00:27:48,918 --> 00:27:51,963
Two guards walking out of here,
not suspicious.

476
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:55,675
- Two guards carrying him out, suspicious.
- He took a beating for me.

477
00:27:55,842 --> 00:27:58,178
Raymond would take a beating
for a total stranger.

478
00:27:58,345 --> 00:28:00,805
Mick, if our time in the can
taught us anything,

479
00:28:00,972 --> 00:28:02,474
it's we look after each other.

480
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,517
It's you and me, right?

481
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:10,273
So, if we enter here,
we can cut the circuit breaker.

482
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,691
Shutting off all the power.

483
00:28:11,858 --> 00:28:14,045
Distracting the guards and giving us time
to save our team.

484
00:28:14,069 --> 00:28:15,838
<i>The probability of this plan
being successful...</i>

485
00:28:15,862 --> 00:28:17,739
There's a 15-second window

486
00:28:17,906 --> 00:28:20,742
where the sharpshooters on the tower
aren't covering the breaker.

487
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:25,330
Which means that somebody would have
to run 120 yards in less than 12 seconds.

488
00:28:25,497 --> 00:28:27,977
<i>Given Mr. Jackson tore
his anterior cruciate ligament...</i>

489
00:28:28,124 --> 00:28:30,418
Have a little faith, Gideon.

490
00:28:32,087 --> 00:28:34,672
You can do this. I know you can.

491
00:28:36,925 --> 00:28:38,009
It's done.

492
00:28:38,176 --> 00:28:43,098
You know, I've never seen a theorem
so simple, so poetic, before.

493
00:28:43,681 --> 00:28:46,810
With this, I can decelerate
the subject's rate of fission

494
00:28:47,477 --> 00:28:49,437
and decrease core body temperature.

495
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:52,440
Yet, something is missing.

496
00:28:53,108 --> 00:28:54,984
I'm telling you, that is the equation.

497
00:28:55,151 --> 00:28:57,487
Everything you need to build
a Quantum Splicer...

498
00:29:01,699 --> 00:29:02,951
"We're coming?"

499
00:29:04,035 --> 00:29:05,203
Explain.

500
00:29:05,995 --> 00:29:07,872
- I cut myself.
- Impossible.

501
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:11,751
You have been monitored ever since
your arrival here, so unless...

502
00:29:13,711 --> 00:29:15,839
So unless someone else was cut,

503
00:29:17,507 --> 00:29:20,510
- yet it appears on your body.
- That's preposterous.

504
00:29:20,677 --> 00:29:23,346
No, no, no. You're somehow connected
to the Burning Man.

505
00:29:23,513 --> 00:29:26,182
That is how you were able to absorb
the nuclear energy at Luskavic.

506
00:29:26,349 --> 00:29:27,434
You are mistaken.

507
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,896
No, you didn't only create Firestorm,
you are one half of Firestorm.

508
00:29:32,063 --> 00:29:34,441
- That's ridiculous.
- Bring the core online.

509
00:29:35,191 --> 00:29:37,360
And to think, all this time,

510
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:39,446
you were the missing link.

511
00:29:39,612 --> 00:29:43,241
Listen to me, it is extremely rare
to find two people who are compatible.

512
00:29:43,408 --> 00:29:44,784
And without the Splicer...

513
00:29:44,951 --> 00:29:49,205
Have you ever merged
with a woman before, Professor?

514
00:29:50,081 --> 00:29:54,711
I think you and I are going
to make a wonderful Firestorm.

515
00:30:18,526 --> 00:30:20,403
What the hell are they doing?

516
00:30:21,029 --> 00:30:23,531
What I should have done from the start,
helping rescue Stein.

517
00:30:23,698 --> 00:30:25,909
<i>- What about the timeline?</i>
- I have a plan.

518
00:30:26,075 --> 00:30:29,537
<i>- Forget about the fail-safe.</i>
- Isn't it a little late for plan C?

519
00:30:29,704 --> 00:30:31,956
<i>Not if Jax can reach
that circuit breaker.</i>

520
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:36,461
Can't believe you're risking
your life for this idiot.

521
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,591
Okay. Okay. You got this.

522
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:44,344
Twelve seconds, open field.

523
00:30:44,719 --> 00:30:46,471
Done it a million times.

524
00:30:59,275 --> 00:31:00,735
Barry Allen, who?

525
00:31:05,823 --> 00:31:07,450
Electromagnetic locks.

526
00:31:08,201 --> 00:31:10,537
- We're dressed as guards.
- Run.

527
00:31:17,752 --> 00:31:19,379
Everyone back in your cells!

528
00:31:25,969 --> 00:31:27,303
Enjoy your new cell mate.

529
00:31:27,887 --> 00:31:29,138
No!

530
00:31:31,432 --> 00:31:32,832
That door leads to the loading bay.

531
00:31:32,976 --> 00:31:34,644
From there, you can get to the Jumpship.

532
00:31:34,811 --> 00:31:37,397
Hey, Mick. This is a strange kind of hug.

533
00:31:37,564 --> 00:31:39,983
- Where are you going?
- I got something to do.

534
00:31:51,369 --> 00:31:54,330
Mr. Savage,
I need to get you to the helicopter.

535
00:31:55,081 --> 00:31:58,084
Make sure the Professor
enters the reactor.

536
00:31:58,251 --> 00:32:00,503
His nuclear mate is waiting for him.

537
00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:15,018
Take the core to full power.

538
00:32:28,573 --> 00:32:32,368
There seems to be a riot going on.
You might want to reconsider your orders.

539
00:32:32,744 --> 00:32:34,787
<i>Vostok knows Stein's
the other half of Firestorm.</i>

540
00:32:34,954 --> 00:32:36,623
She's trying to merge with him.

541
00:32:43,963 --> 00:32:44,964
Rip.

542
00:32:45,214 --> 00:32:48,301
Once Stein is inside the reactor,
he will become Soviet Firestorm.

543
00:32:48,468 --> 00:32:49,636
Do you copy?

544
00:32:53,056 --> 00:32:54,349
I have the shot.

545
00:32:58,269 --> 00:32:59,729
<i>Sara, don't do it.</i>

546
00:32:59,896 --> 00:33:02,565
I don't have a choice.
It's the only way to save Star City.

547
00:33:02,732 --> 00:33:03,900
The future.

548
00:33:04,067 --> 00:33:05,526
<i>That's how a killer thinks.</i>

549
00:33:05,943 --> 00:33:07,487
And that's not you anymore.

550
00:33:28,841 --> 00:33:30,134
Our energy.

551
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,265
It yearns to be whole, Professor.

552
00:33:36,432 --> 00:33:38,351
Not without the Splicer.

553
00:33:40,978 --> 00:33:42,980
<i>Without the Splicer, you'll never be able</i>

554
00:33:43,272 --> 00:33:45,112
<i>to control our nuclear reaction.</i>

555
00:33:45,233 --> 00:33:47,151
<i>You have to listen to me, Dr. Vostok.</i>

556
00:33:47,318 --> 00:33:50,822
<i>Unless we un-fuse,
you'll end up killing us both.</i>

557
00:33:56,703 --> 00:34:01,124
<i>Rip Hunter must be a fool
to send you into my arms.</i>

558
00:34:01,958 --> 00:34:04,127
Come with me, Chay-Ara,

559
00:34:04,627 --> 00:34:07,130
<i>and I will find a way
to prolong your life.</i>

560
00:34:07,296 --> 00:34:09,674
We will live together in eternity.

561
00:34:10,299 --> 00:34:11,300
No.

562
00:34:12,468 --> 00:34:13,511
"No?"

563
00:34:15,555 --> 00:34:19,308
My answer will always be no.

564
00:34:24,147 --> 00:34:25,148
Go.

565
00:34:25,982 --> 00:34:28,234
You want to kill me

566
00:34:28,401 --> 00:34:29,485
<i>again?</i>

567
00:34:29,902 --> 00:34:32,572
Doesn't this game
ever get too old for you, Gareeb?

568
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:36,075
- It's Captain Hunter, if you don't mind.
- Oh.

569
00:34:36,325 --> 00:34:39,454
I'm here to make sure
you never build a Firestorm.

570
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,497
And for my watch actually.

571
00:34:41,664 --> 00:34:46,002
You stole it from me during
a pagan blood ritual back in 1975.

572
00:34:49,422 --> 00:34:50,673
Ring any bells?

573
00:34:51,507 --> 00:34:52,508
<i>Uh-uh.</i>

574
00:34:53,509 --> 00:34:54,761
Slowly.

575
00:34:58,347 --> 00:35:00,558
I have no desire to kill you.

576
00:35:01,309 --> 00:35:02,643
I want you alive.

577
00:35:03,352 --> 00:35:06,272
I want you to see the world burn.

578
00:35:07,356 --> 00:35:12,361
I have looked so often at your wife
and son these last 11 years.

579
00:35:12,528 --> 00:35:14,614
Miranda and Jonas.

580
00:35:15,031 --> 00:35:17,158
Their faces etched into my mind.

581
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:21,204
And when I finally get to meet them,
I will let them know

582
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:24,707
that you and your friends
are responsible for their suffering.

583
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:27,210
Not if I see you first.

584
00:35:35,718 --> 00:35:37,094
How's it going up there?

585
00:35:40,556 --> 00:35:42,058
<i>Sara? Sara, are you there?</i>

586
00:35:42,225 --> 00:35:45,561
Now you're on the comms?
We need to get out of here.

587
00:36:03,538 --> 00:36:07,416
- No, don't shoot, Grey is in there.
- A lot of good it would do, anyhow.

588
00:36:07,583 --> 00:36:10,086
- Man, screw this.
- What are you doing?

589
00:36:10,253 --> 00:36:13,297
- I'm getting Stein back.
- We'll cover you.

590
00:36:30,773 --> 00:36:32,275
I know you're in there, Grey.

591
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:34,652
And he's begging for you to save yourself.

592
00:36:34,819 --> 00:36:36,279
I wasn't talking to you.

593
00:36:37,613 --> 00:36:41,409
I was talking to Professor Stein.

594
00:36:41,659 --> 00:36:43,661
Your mind is stronger than hers, Grey.

595
00:36:44,161 --> 00:36:45,288
I get it.

596
00:36:45,621 --> 00:36:48,221
I know why you've been so hard on me.
You're trying to protect me.

597
00:36:48,332 --> 00:36:50,793
You don't want to lose me
like you lost Ronnie.

598
00:36:51,544 --> 00:36:52,670
And that's why I know

599
00:36:52,879 --> 00:36:54,879
you're not going to let her kill me.

600
00:36:55,298 --> 00:36:56,775
'Cause I've had you inside of my head,

601
00:36:56,799 --> 00:36:59,302
and I know what a tough
old son of a bitch you can be.

602
00:37:00,177 --> 00:37:01,554
<i>So, you got to fight her.</i>

603
00:37:01,721 --> 00:37:06,517
Because you and me, we're Firestorm, Grey.
You and me.

604
00:37:11,606 --> 00:37:13,816
Jefferson. You okay?

605
00:37:14,275 --> 00:37:15,610
- Yeah. You?
- Yeah.

606
00:37:15,776 --> 00:37:17,403
Not for long.

607
00:37:18,779 --> 00:37:21,157
I tried to warn her.
Without the Splicer, and myself,

608
00:37:21,324 --> 00:37:23,784
her nuclear powers
are dangerously unstable.

609
00:37:25,453 --> 00:37:28,956
It appears Dr. Vostok
is having a bit of a meltdown.

610
00:37:29,123 --> 00:37:30,333
It's fascinating.

611
00:37:30,499 --> 00:37:32,668
I think what he means to say is, "Run."

612
00:37:32,835 --> 00:37:35,275
<i>I'll have the Jumpship waiting
just beyond the main gate.</i>

Courtesy of Yuri the Bear.

614
00:38:04,533 --> 00:38:08,037
- How did you even have time to steal this?
- There's always time to steal.

615
00:38:08,371 --> 00:38:09,455
Thank you.

616
00:38:09,622 --> 00:38:13,542
And just so you know,
I know you're more than just a thief.

617
00:38:13,918 --> 00:38:16,879
You took a beating for me.
We're even. End of story.

618
00:38:17,046 --> 00:38:18,422
Well, thank you.

619
00:38:18,714 --> 00:38:20,383
More drinking. Less feeling.

620
00:38:20,549 --> 00:38:25,012
A toast. To the first time we haven't
completely ruined the timeline.

621
00:38:25,179 --> 00:38:26,531
Please tell me that's true, Gideon.

622
00:38:26,555 --> 00:38:28,724
<i>The projections of the future
are back to normal.</i>

623
00:38:28,891 --> 00:38:31,102
- I'll drink to that.
<i>- To Rip.</i>

624
00:38:31,268 --> 00:38:34,063
To things not going according to his plan.

625
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:36,107
- To the Captain.
- To the Captain.

626
00:38:36,273 --> 00:38:37,542
- All right.
<i>- Hold on.</i>

627
00:38:37,566 --> 00:38:40,319
- Jefferson, you're not quite 21.
- No.

628
00:38:40,486 --> 00:38:44,073
In 1986, the drinking age
in Russia was 12, so...

629
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:48,077
Well, perhaps we could let it slide
this one time. After all, you

630
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,288
were the hero today. You saved my life.

631
00:38:51,455 --> 00:38:53,582
Oh, that? That was no biggie.

632
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:56,752
Having merged
with an insane Russian scientist,

633
00:38:57,169 --> 00:39:00,506
I now know how lucky I am
to have you as my partner.

634
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:02,925
Partners.

635
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:06,178
Stein doesn't know, does he?

636
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:10,516
- That I almost killed him?
- That I advised you to kill him.

637
00:39:11,684 --> 00:39:14,895
It's funny.
When I was in the League of Assassins,

638
00:39:15,271 --> 00:39:18,607
failure to follow through on a hit
was unforgivable,

639
00:39:19,025 --> 00:39:21,027
a thousand times worse than death.

640
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:23,112
Maybe I'm losing my edge.

641
00:39:24,113 --> 00:39:25,573
Or gaining a new one.

642
00:39:27,283 --> 00:39:29,952
The fact that you didn't pull the trigger
speaks volumes.

643
00:39:30,202 --> 00:39:33,831
The safe move was to kill Martin,
with the Cold War hanging in the balance.

644
00:39:34,123 --> 00:39:38,544
I would like to think it was
your humanity that stayed your hand.

645
00:39:40,337 --> 00:39:42,423
I'd like to think that, too.

646
00:39:42,757 --> 00:39:44,550
But I had some help.

647
00:39:50,556 --> 00:39:51,557
What was that?

648
00:39:51,766 --> 00:39:54,006
<i>We have been struck
with an explosive projectile.</i>

649
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:56,604
- No kidding.
- Everyone get strapped in. Now!

650
00:39:56,771 --> 00:39:58,611
We're in the Temporal Zone,
I don't understand.

651
00:39:58,731 --> 00:40:00,066
No one should be able to...

652
00:40:01,317 --> 00:40:02,401
You were saying?

653
00:40:05,571 --> 00:40:08,531
<i>A scan of the vessel suggests
that it is the bounty hunter Chronos.</i>

654
00:40:08,657 --> 00:40:10,576
Oh, man, this guy has impeccable timing.

655
00:40:16,123 --> 00:40:18,334
<i>He appears to be following us.</i>

656
00:40:19,627 --> 00:40:21,212
<i>Firing counter-measures.</i>

657
00:40:28,761 --> 00:40:30,096
<i>Counter-measures effective.</i>

658
00:40:30,262 --> 00:40:32,431
- Have we lost him?
<i>- Yes, but not his missile.</i>

659
00:40:34,016 --> 00:40:36,018
<i>Our aft shield is gravely compromised.</i>

660
00:40:36,185 --> 00:40:38,062
Initiating evasive maneuvers.

661
00:40:41,398 --> 00:40:42,858
Vodka was a bad choice.

662
00:40:43,025 --> 00:40:46,695
<i>Impact in three, two, one...</i>

663
00:40:50,282 --> 00:40:52,868
<i>Sir, we've just been
knocked out of the time stream.</i>

664
00:40:53,035 --> 00:40:55,996
- What does that mean?
- It means we're crash landing.

665
00:40:56,163 --> 00:40:58,582
In place and time.

666
00:41:11,137 --> 00:41:12,847
<i>Gideon, camouflage the ship.</i>

667
00:41:13,305 --> 00:41:16,851
This doesn't look like the type of place
we want to linger out in the open.

668
00:41:20,104 --> 00:41:22,231
That looks a lot
like a Palmer Tech building,

669
00:41:22,398 --> 00:41:24,650
but why does it have a Smoak logo on it?

670
00:41:26,527 --> 00:41:28,195
Wait, this is Star City.

671
00:41:28,362 --> 00:41:30,781
I thought you said the timeline was safe.

672
00:41:30,948 --> 00:41:33,742
Yes, Star City was intact in 2016.

673
00:41:33,909 --> 00:41:37,621
This... This is 2046.

674
00:41:39,331 --> 00:41:40,666
Don't move.

675
00:41:41,834 --> 00:41:44,128
- Oh, Thank God.
- I said, don't move.

676
00:41:45,754 --> 00:41:48,591
It's me. It's Sara.

677
00:41:50,092 --> 00:41:53,429
Hey, Oliver, look.
I know it's been a long time,

678
00:41:53,596 --> 00:41:56,599
but don't you remember that Rip Hunter
recruited us to become Legends?

679
00:41:59,101 --> 00:42:01,103
I never heard of any Legends.

680
00:42:29,965 --> 00:42:30,966
