1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:06,212
<i>My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

2
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:09,089
<i>To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

3
00:00:09,218 --> 00:00:12,211
<i>but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

4
00:00:12,304 --> 00:00:15,047
<i>I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.</i>

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,302
<i>But I became lost in time.</i>

6
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:20,180
<i>It took everything in my friends'
power to bring me back.</i>

7
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,263
<i>And in doing so, our world
was opened up to new threats.</i>

8
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:26,100
<i>And I'm the only one fast enough
to stop them.</i>

9
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:28,401
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

10
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,187
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

11
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:34,365
He only wants the bus metas,
he wants their powers, all of them.

12
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:35,696
DeVoe has absorbed the powers

13
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:38,950
of Kilg%re, Hazard, Black Bison,
Brainstorm and Dwarfstar.

14
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,202
- I'm gonna take DeVoe down.
- Just like Izzy would have wanted.

15
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,750
DeVoe orchestrated everything to get
the people he wanted on the bus.

16
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:46,919
We've got a planner, just like Thawne.

17
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:48,962
This is an intelligence booster.

18
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,915
I'll finally be able
to outthink The Thinker.

19
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,637
- Daddy?
- Pleased to meet you, sir.

20
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,430
The last two remaining bus metas.

21
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,267
Janet Petty and Edwin Gauss.

22
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,311
<i>- Ralph.
- Ready.</i>

23
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:07,687
<i>Connect double Scarlet Speedster
in three, two, one.</i>

24
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:09,517
<i>Wait. I got a better idea.</i>

25
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,607
Over here, Doc Ock.

26
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:15,531
Watch this, Master Splinter.

27
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:18,701
Turtle power.

28
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,955
Shut it down.

29
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:33,291
All right, let's run
it again. We gotta make this work.

30
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:34,918
Does he know that?

31
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:37,762
Ralph?

32
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:40,177
Ralph?

33
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,142
What?

34
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:45,686
One more time, please.
Follow Barry's plan.

35
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:48,230
You know, the one where I've spent
hours of my precious time

36
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:50,024
programming realistic holograms for you?

37
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:52,439
Which, bravo on that, by the way.

38
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:54,312
- Thank you.
- Look, just...

39
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:56,398
Morph yourself into Barry,
there'll be two Flashes,

40
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:59,325
Thinker won't know which
one is which, and we'll confuse him.

41
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:00,652
Kind of a "her," actually.

42
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:02,487
Ralph, you're missing
the point of this exercise.

43
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:04,664
No, I get it.
I was just doing a little improv.

44
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,241
But this
isn't stand-up comedy!

45
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:08,201
Yeah, I know that,
but you just let it play out,

46
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:10,708
it would've worked, you could've
done some improv-ing of your own.

47
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,629
Comedy comes in threes, man.

48
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:14,752
We're trying to protect you.

49
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:16,258
DeVoe's coming.

50
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:18,211
We need to be ready, all of us.

51
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,466
Okay?

52
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,047
I still think it's a pretty good plan.

53
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,303
I hide my face, I save my ass.

54
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,687
We'd make a fortune.
An improv group made up of superheroes?

55
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:36,897
We can take it to Washington.

56
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,027
- We'd be the DC Comics.
- No, Ralph.

57
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,653
First rule of improv is say yes.

58
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:42,406
Would it kill you to take
training seriously?

59
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,738
Would it kill you to open up
your mind grapes just a little?

60
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:47,786
Hey, we'll get there.

61
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:48,992
Eventually, but we'll get there.

62
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:50,952
He's just making a big joke
out of the whole thing.

63
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:52,753
It's just the way he is, Barry.

64
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:56,298
I know, but he needs to think
like a hero, stay on point.

65
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:59,719
DeVoe's thought of everything.
We can't just wing this one.

66
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:02,422
Look, we'll figure it out.
We always do, right?

67
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:03,506
Melting Point's on our team now,

68
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,761
we just need to find
the other two bus metas.

69
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:07,218
And we'll be in good shape.

70
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:08,761
Yeah.

71
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:14,150
Where are we with tracking down
Edwin Gauss and Janet Petty?

72
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:16,979
- No, no. He's... He's still...
- What?

73
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,230
Working on it.

74
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,486
I can't work with all this noise!

75
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:24,364
That is disgusting, Harry,
really, grow up.

76
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:25,569
Really?

77
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:26,908
Wasn't me.

78
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:29,873
That was expensive.

79
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:33,912
Harry, look, every time
you try to locate these guys,

80
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:34,995
it's the same thing.

81
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,626
I'm telling you,
you just crack that thing open,

82
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:38,504
- it's probably broken.
- It's not broken.

83
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:41,427
It's just finding these two
is complicated.

84
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:43,179
Why is that?

85
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:47,100
Because this dude, Edwin Gauss,
flat out disappeared the day

86
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,017
Allen came out of the speed force.
No credit card charges,

87
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:51,346
no bank withdrawals,
no social media posts, nothing.

88
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,102
- Gone.
- What about Janet Petty?

89
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:56,310
Just as tricky. I asked Joe
to pull her file from C.C.P.D.

90
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:57,814
Her first known record wasn't
until she was 13.

91
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:01,488
Some sort of a nomad.
Last known address, Iron Heights.

92
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,237
- What's she in for?
- Trifecta, breaking and entering,

93
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:04,783
trespassing, and burglary.

94
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,078
What we should be worried about is,
where is she now?

95
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:08,746
And what are her powers?

96
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,078
Is that really her handle?

97
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,367
<i>"Null"?</i>

98
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:15,875
Okay, DeVoe needs both of these
people for whatever he has planned,

99
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,375
so we have to figure out where they are.

100
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:20,300
I will, Allen, if I can get
a little peace, a little quiet,

101
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:21,546
and no interruptions!

102
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:25,337
Great.

103
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,011
- Cisky.
- Breacher?

104
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,178
I need your help.

105
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,389
Little bit
of a mixed message here.

106
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,725
I was hunting Lord Crucifer,

107
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:39,227
leader of the Tenth Circle.

108
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:41,654
His cult of bloodsuckers ambushed me.

109
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,904
- They had me surrounded.
- So, you were attacked by...

110
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,109
Vampires?

111
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:48,365
Hundreds of vampires.

112
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,914
The battle was fierce,
but I managed to dismantle

113
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,491
his entire force.

114
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,494
But when I went to finish off Crucifer,

115
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:57,578
something happened to me.

116
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,379
My powers, they were gone.

117
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:03,550
What do you mean?

118
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:05,173
I couldn't vibe blast.

119
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,591
Crucifer got away.

120
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,764
He must've done something to my powers!

121
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,591
Has this ever happened before?

122
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:11,971
Never.

123
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:17,849
But Cynthia always said
you were an intelligent man.

124
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,859
Well versed in the meta-science.

125
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:23,939
Glad to hear Gypsy
still remembers who I am.

126
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,364
Hey, you're her boss.
You would know the answer to this.

127
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,238
Does she ever get a day off?

128
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,911
Cynthia is very devoted to her job.

129
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:33,117
But in regards to your skills...

130
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,074
Yeah, yeah, let me guess.

131
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,160
- You think she's wrong.
- No!

132
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,416
What I wanna say is,
I think you can fix me.

133
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:46,544
Oh.

134
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:50,423
Well...

135
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:51,724
Sir...

136
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:56,642
We would be happy to run some tests
in the speed lab, you know,

137
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,188
see if everything's okay.

138
00:05:58,275 --> 00:05:59,356
Thank you, Cisco.

139
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:02,192
Now, I must get some tea.

140
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:09,651
- He didn't insult me once.
- Nope.

141
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,035
I just hope we can help him.

142
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,119
How was your rest, my love?

143
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:23,171
Wonderful, I've never felt more
rejuvenated and ready

144
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:24,965
to realize our dream.

145
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,087
Clifford.

146
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:30,637
The additional dark matter
from our subject metas,

147
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,717
is overwhelming this host's body.

148
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:35,763
How long do we have?

149
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:37,220
At the present rate...

150
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:39,847
Just over a week's time.

151
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:42,649
No, I will not allow it.

152
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,569
It may be possible to adjust
the biomass index,

153
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:49,740
re-calibrate the energy distribution,
extend your current host's life.

154
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,114
Odd.

155
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:57,365
There are already plans for such
an adjustment partially designed.

156
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:00,000
I attempted the same course of action.

157
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:04,581
Though my mind for engineering
is nowhere near as gifted as yours.

158
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,836
Well, you got a good start.

159
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:11,129
I will be able to complete
these designs within a few hours.

160
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:15,300
Rest, my love. I will handle everything.

161
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,636
You always do.

162
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:22,106
And then we will continue on our search

163
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:25,356
for the remaining two bus metas.

164
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:30,148
You mean, three.
The Weeper is still at large.

165
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:33,609
Yes.

166
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,196
Three.

167
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:39,949
Perhaps my mind is being
affected as well.

168
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,048
Come on, put your back into it.

169
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:55,848
Put your fat back into it.

170
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,058
This stinks, man.

171
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,853
This is too heavy and you're too weak.

172
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:03,643
Let's get the big dolly.

173
00:08:03,667 --> 00:08:05,667
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

174
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:45,893
Dude, the crate's gone.

175
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:47,475
We gotta call the boss.

176
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:07,203
Well, well, well, well, well.

177
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,377
If the crown fits...

178
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,636
We're moving, I was telling the guy,

179
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,931
"It's gonna take all night
to move this stuff."

180
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:21,259
Okay, remember.
Let's just be discreet.

181
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:22,968
Neither one of us
are supposed to be here.

182
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,599
- Can you do that?
- Can pigs fly?

183
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,439
- No.
- They can if you put 'em on an airplane.

184
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:28,857
Think, Allen, think.

185
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:29,979
Okay.

186
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,528
Just here with your chai latte,
Detective West.

187
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:33,979
Subtle.

188
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,690
- It was gone.
- Excuse me, just a second, okay?

189
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,114
Hey.

190
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:40,240
What happened?

191
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,571
Robbery.

192
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:44,031
Stole the Kahndaq dynasty family crown.

193
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,287
It was brought here
for the museum exhibition.

194
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:49,211
The security guard said that
it was being transported

195
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:52,131
in a steel-plated crate,
weighs about 200 pounds.

196
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:54,546
Suddenly disappeared without a trace,

197
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,961
and then reappeared completely smashed.

198
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,217
So was anything else
missing in the museum?

199
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:00,923
Just the crown, nothing else is missing.

200
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:02,929
Should I stretch around the perimeter,
check things out?

201
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,887
No, not yet. I can tell from here
to cause that type of impact,

202
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,188
case had to be moving at
at least 55 miles per hour.

203
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,436
So we're looking for a meta
with super strength?

204
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,897
Maybe. Are there fingerprints
on the case?

205
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,603
I'll have them dust it,
send the results in.

206
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:17,280
Why wait? I can just grab the tape,
get the prints right now.

207
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:18,357
No, no. Hey!

208
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,784
It was definitely Killer Frost,
and she looked at me.

209
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,156
Ralph!

210
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:26,869
Dude!

211
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,042
I need this job!

212
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,337
Allen, look what you did.

213
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:33,793
That's you, bro.

214
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,972
Die, Plastoid, die!

215
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,016
Again.

216
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,066
All right.

217
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:59,816
I think that's enough.

218
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,361
All right. Hey, look, Breacher,
I know you're clearly very...

219
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,784
Frustrated, uh,

220
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,991
but don't stress, okay?

221
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:10,834
We're gonna figure this out,
and once we do,

222
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:12,787
we're gonna fix it, I promise.

223
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,133
Cisky, look.

224
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:20,552
I'm sorry for the way I've treated you.

225
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:22,258
But when you fix me,

226
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:26,392
I'll give Cynthia more time
to be with you.

227
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,343
Really?

228
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:29,644
Yeah.

229
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:33,231
Now, I'm hungry.

230
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,726
We can fix that, too.

231
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:38,146
Um, there's donuts
in the downstairs break room.

232
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,525
Help yourself, it's a huge selection.

233
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,533
Yeah. Try the pineapple fritters.

234
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:46,654
And don't forget to try
the nacho donuts.

235
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:48,114
Those are really good.

236
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:55,334
Looks like things are looking up
for your boy, Cisco.

237
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,664
Yeah?

238
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,336
What? What?

239
00:11:58,426 --> 00:11:59,837
What is... What? What is it?
What is wrong with him?

240
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:02,295
Nothing, really.
He seems to be in good health.

241
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,924
There's nothing abnormal
in his blood work

242
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:06,382
and his body scan showed
no signs of cellular damage,

243
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:09,014
despite years of using
vibrational powers.

244
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:10,594
Okay. So, then, why the face?

245
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:13,647
Because Crucifer didn't take
his powers from him.

246
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,690
Father Time did.

247
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,352
He can't blast
because he's getting older?

248
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:21,314
Mmm-hmm. Powers like yours requires
a lot of energy,

249
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,444
and when that energy
starts to dwindle...

250
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:26,493
Vibe blasts are the first things to go?

251
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,990
I think you have to tell him.

252
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:31,657
He's never ever gonna let me
see Gypsy if I tell him.

253
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,826
He's probably gonna send a knife

254
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,378
flying right through my skull
if I tell him.

255
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,171
He might...

256
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,332
But it's the right thing to do.

257
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,610
What the...

258
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:17,119
Initiate chemical analysis.

259
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:28,597
A $40,000 vase?

260
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,261
It's not like it was made of gold.

261
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,678
Actually, it was, and you two
can't go to crime scenes anymore,

262
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,307
- PIs or not.
- Don't give me that look.

263
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:37,640
I was just trying to speed up
the process of finding this meta, Allen.

264
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:38,975
Which is taking forever.

265
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,229
Wait, we got a hit.

266
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:43,820
Jeannie Williams.
Um, oh, wait, we got multiple hits.

267
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:47,942
Jane Liska, Judy Newton...
She's used like 17 different aliases.

268
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:49,910
Okay, so how do we find her?

269
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,950
And we can't just wait for her
to rob somebody else.

270
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,622
Well, we don't have to.

271
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,952
We have the many variations
of her facade.

272
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:00,504
All right? We simply plug these
many variations into

273
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,252
- the facial recognition software.
- See if we get a hit.

274
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:03,423
Exactly right.

275
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,337
You're starting
to come in handy, Harry.

276
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,462
That's 40 minutes ago.

277
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:09,922
Corner of Orchard and Broome.

278
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:11,594
Orchard and Broome? What's over there?

279
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:12,970
Not "what."

280
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:14,268
Who.

281
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,679
- Come on. Come on.
- What are you...

282
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,110
It smells like liverwurst.

283
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,150
Yeah, wait till we get inside.

284
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:28,649
Open up.

285
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:30,359
Okay, stick to the plan.
We question her.

286
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:31,819
We find Null, we cuff her.

287
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:34,326
Got it. Little good cop/bad cop action.

288
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,785
Who the hell are you?

289
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:42,625
Your worst nightmare.

290
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,790
Uh, Joe? What are you
doing?

291
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:49,545
Detective Joe West, C.C.P.D.

292
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:51,179
We got a couple of questions
for you, scumbag.

293
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:54,884
Hey, only my closest friends
can call me that.

294
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:58,812
Word is, there's a new cutpurse in town

295
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:02,858
who likes fancy jewels,
last seen in this part of town.

296
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:05,770
- PI Barry Allen.
- PI Barry Allen...

297
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:06,944
Show him, show him.

298
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,280
Oh, Barry Allen, I know all about
your spectacular fall from grace.

299
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:13,907
- Tragic, really.
- Yes, thank you. Just take a look.

300
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:19,704
We're guessing she came here
for help to wash the sparklies.

301
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:21,205
Oh, I should be so lucky.

302
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:22,957
Certainly wouldn't mind a drop-in

303
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:25,881
from a lovely-looking lassie like this.
You know what I mean?

304
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:29,381
But unfortunately, not in my cards.
I'm sorry, can I keep this?

305
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:32,846
I will mess you up for lying in my face.

306
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,139
- Ralph.
- "Ralph"?

307
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:35,966
- There's no Ralph here.
- Joe.

308
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,676
I'm Detective Joe West,

309
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:41,605
the baddest damn cop
you've ever come across.

310
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:43,899
As God as my witness, I am not lying.

311
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:45,226
I'm not.

312
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:48,357
Oopsy-daisy.

313
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,359
I knew it.

314
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,526
- Joe West doesn't make any mistakes.
- Okay.

315
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:55,619
Where'd she go, Earl?

316
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,451
Deal's off.

317
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,081
Damn it.

318
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:07,747
Cuffs.

319
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:09,458
- Cuffs.
- Allen.

320
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:31,863
Babe, you okay?

321
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,408
I just wanna get down from here
as soon as possible.

322
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,827
Maybe you should try to burp
yourself down like Charlie Bucket.

323
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:37,994
Ralph.

324
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,823
- Anything?
- Well, as best I can tell,

325
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:42,954
Null's powers affect
the density of his cells.

326
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:44,330
It's like
you've been filled with helium.

327
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,537
- Terrific.
- Always knew you were a lightweight.

328
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:47,792
I swear, Ralph...

329
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:50,795
Hey, is there a way
to reengage his gravitational...

330
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:52,342
Gravitational force.

331
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,886
Huh. Turns out...

332
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:56,759
Not necessary.

333
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:57,885
Do not let go.

334
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,932
Based on Barry's standard mass
and gravitational force G

335
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,009
and taking into account

336
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,846
the half-life decrement
of Null's dark matter infusion,

337
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:07,308
this effect should eventually
just wear off.

338
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,236
- "Wear off"?
- Your cells should return to normal

339
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:12,858
- right about...
- What the hell?

340
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:16,942
Now.

341
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,403
Two for the landing,
but perfect 10 for the "thud" noise.

342
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:21,238
Why are you joking right now?

343
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,078
I mean, seriously, what the hell
was that back there,

344
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,249
pretending to be Joe?

345
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,377
I committed to the bit,
I couldn't blow my cover.

346
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,500
Ralph, what if that had
happened outside on the street?

347
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,252
I could've floated away
into the stratosphere,

348
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:33,174
- fallen to my death.
- I would've figured something out.

349
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:34,251
Ral...

350
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,588
Out of the 12 bus metas we've found,
DeVoe is in control of seven of them.

351
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:39,093
If he gets Null, it'll be eight.

352
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:41,095
If he gets control of her powers...

353
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,719
We're talking about your life here.

354
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:48,307
Sorry, I was just thinking about
the end of <i>Lost.</i>

355
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,818
I mean, were they in purgatory?
What did Kate really see in Jack?

356
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,145
Ralph...

357
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:57,278
I'm sorry, man, but I'm benching you.

358
00:17:58,369 --> 00:17:59,485
- Why?
- Because you're constantly

359
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:02,037
in the middle of a comedy routine
instead of doing what you should.

360
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:03,204
If you had just tossed me the cuffs,

361
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:04,702
we would have Null right now.

362
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:05,999
Yeah, or she could have ran out the door

363
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,826
and I'd stretched the cuffs
on her when she didn't see it coming.

364
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,003
It's fine.

365
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:12,459
Look, I'm doing what's best for you.

366
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,590
No, you're not.

367
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:16,134
You're doing what's best for you.

368
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:27,229
Display complete physiological
results for "DeVoe, Marlize."

369
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:31,520
Cortisol levels low.

370
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:35,604
Recent display of tachycardia.

371
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:37,155
Repetitive pupil dilation.

372
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:41,819
Display serotonin level.

373
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,537
319 nanograms.

374
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:50,878
Levels found in patients
using psychoactive narcotics.

375
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,420
How is that?

376
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,631
Subject four still at large.

377
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,224
"Created to provide
widespread euphoria...

378
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:13,024
"Or feelings of love."

379
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:27,532
What if we put him
on an all-alkaline diet,

380
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,950
full of antioxidants?

381
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:35,039
- Nope.
- Okay, what if we...

382
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:39,752
Oh, what if we make a super-shake
full of, like, enzymes and probiotics?

383
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:42,425
Neither of those
are gonna work long-term, Cisco.

384
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:45,174
Okay, well, we gotta come up
with something, right?

385
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,846
I mean, how old is this guy, anyway?

386
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:52,188
This guy's old.

387
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:54,524
We have to solve this.

388
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,861
'Cause I don't know about you,
but I actually like my life.

389
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:01,107
I know this isn't the easy answer.

390
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,987
But I think you have to tell him.

391
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,443
Cisky!

392
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:09,281
Oh, hey, you, we were
just talking about you.

393
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,583
I've tasted all your donuts.

394
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:13,376
Where is my cure?

395
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:14,870
Well, it's a little, um...

396
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:18,006
It's a little complicated.

397
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:22,340
But, you are lucky,
my friend, because...

398
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:26,924
Your fix is as simple
as taking one of these

399
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:29,054
- little pink pills.
- Blue.

400
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,176
Blue pills.

401
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:31,261
Right there.

402
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,182
"Antihistamine."

403
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:37,689
That... That's right, antihistamine.

404
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:42,239
See, uh, "stamine,"
that's Latin for "stamina,"

405
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,574
which you have plenty of, you know.

406
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,902
You have so much of it
that it's actually hurting you.

407
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:49,739
But this antimatter pill,
it's gonna level you right out.

408
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:50,910
Oh, you're taking it now.

409
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,533
He's taking it now.

410
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,719
Why is my vibe blast different?

411
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:08,431
I think it's a side effect of the pills.

412
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,051
Hasn't been thoroughly researched yet.

413
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:12,886
But, you know, headaches, nausea,

414
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:15,935
different, uh, colored vibes.

415
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,017
I'm cured. Thank you.

416
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:21,227
Anytime.

417
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,192
You do realize
you're just making this worse?

418
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:33,206
Nothing on Null so far.

419
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:35,250
Harry's gonna try something else.

420
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:37,961
- We'll find her.
- We have to.

421
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:41,256
Even if Ralph does everything
in his power to screw it up.

422
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:42,882
Barry.

423
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,794
- That is not his intention.
- Well, he could've fooled me.

424
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,262
It's his life. I mean,
if there's anything he cares about,

425
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:50,011
- it's losing it.
- Well, he's gonna lose it

426
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,807
if he doesn't start thinking like me,
like I taught him.

427
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:54,053
Thinking like you?

428
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,432
No.

429
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:58,814
He's never gonna do that, Barry,
and you can't expect him to.

430
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:01,897
Oh, boy.

431
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:05,404
Robbery at Central City Jewelry.

432
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:07,653
- Man, she loves bling.
- I'm on it.

433
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:08,904
Wait, you need backup.

434
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,485
Well, Ralph's too much
of a liability right now,

435
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:11,653
he stays benched.

436
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:13,204
- Caitlin, Cisco?
- They're with Breacher,

437
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,531
it would take too long to wait for them.

438
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:16,412
- Then what's the plan?
- The plan

439
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,535
is oculation.

440
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:20,295
You said her fingertips,

441
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:21,917
they illuminated when she used
her powers,

442
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,966
that means dark matter accelerant,
that means powers are generating

443
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:28,136
from the optic nerve...
What I'm trying to say is...

444
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:31,511
Null can't gravitate
what she cannot see.

445
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,059
So you vibrate beyond the speed
of sight as you approach her eyeline.

446
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:36,477
I'll be invisible to her.

447
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:39,230
- It worked against DeVoe.
- That's right.

448
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:56,619
Didn't see that coming.

449
00:22:57,126 --> 00:22:58,333
That's kind of the point.

450
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:02,120
No, you didn't see that coming.

451
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:05,544
See, I call it my "getaway car."

452
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:11,046
'Cause either the person in there dies,

453
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:12,968
or you let me get away.

454
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:38,577
You okay?

455
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,078
It's okay, just stay here.

456
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:57,058
This useless piece
of trash is... Useless.

457
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:59,978
It's like... I'm so dumb, I can't even
come up with a good synonym

458
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:01,976
- for this useless piece of trash.
- Harry.

459
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:04,808
No one could've predicted that
Null would have picked herself

460
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:06,143
out of the cuffs or taken a hostage.

461
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:08,853
Nor did either of you predict
the location of a 120-pound woman

462
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:10,314
using the curvature of space-time

463
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:12,069
caused by the uneven
distribution of mass,

464
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,275
yet still somehow

465
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:15,614
failed to account for
the gravitational pull

466
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:20,745
of a 4,000-pound car
floating right above her head.

467
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,371
Scientists have spent decades

468
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,623
trying to understand relativity
and quantum gravity...

469
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,124
This is not about
understanding gravity, Allen,

470
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:28,878
it's about understanding her,
or not understanding her.

471
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:32,006
As it turns out, DeVoe can somehow
calculate human behavior.

472
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:34,762
Harry, stop. Look, I'm the one
that let her get away.

473
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:36,965
- You did your best.
- Did I, Allen, really?

474
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:39,642
This is the second meta
to evade the dampening cuffs.

475
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:41,804
It's been almost a year.

476
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:43,104
And where are we?

477
00:24:43,774 --> 00:24:45,231
And where is DeVoe?

478
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:51,066
What?

479
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,449
Nothing, it's just...

480
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,447
You went out into the field
and you had a plan and...

481
00:24:57,955 --> 00:24:58,991
It didn't work.

482
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:01,330
But they do for DeVoe.
Harry's not wrong.

483
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,662
DeVoe's gone over every possible outcome

484
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:04,959
before making his plans.

485
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:07,628
Which we can't do,
and neither can Harry.

486
00:25:07,715 --> 00:25:09,172
Well, then, what are we supposed to do?

487
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:11,671
I mean, you want us to just
ad-lib like Ralph wants us to?

488
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,503
Barry, you didn't see it,
but when you were gone,

489
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:16,721
Ralph rose to the occasion.

490
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:18,799
He cracked jokes,
he thought outside the box.

491
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:21,475
I mean, he got the job done
in the way that he knows how.

492
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:25,980
So, the question is,
are you upset with Ralph

493
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:27,807
because you think he's screwing around,

494
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:29,813
or because he's not following your plan?

495
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:33,442
Breacher.

496
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:35,482
I thought maybe we could have a drink.

497
00:25:35,576 --> 00:25:38,068
I don't know, you strike me
as kind of a tequila guy, so...

498
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:42,118
Oh, crap.

499
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:49,162
You've come back
to die, Breacher.

500
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:54,797
Time has come, Crucifer.
Die, vampire, die.

501
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:59,005
Frak me, he's gonna die.

502
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,763
Die!

503
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:09,520
Wait a second.

504
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:13,937
Hey, back up, <i>viejo.</i>

505
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:15,488
Yo, <i>Dusk Till Dawn.</i>

506
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,190
I think it's time you saw some sun.

507
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:21,995
Idiot, sunlight doesn't hurt
this type of vampire.

508
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:23,534
What?

509
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,161
Time to go.

510
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:36,297
You said your antimatter
histamine would cure me.

511
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:39,596
Uh, yeah, I did say that, didn't I?

512
00:26:40,182 --> 00:26:43,391
You lied to me.
You said you could fix me.

513
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:44,843
Now...

514
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:46,178
I'll fix you.

515
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:50,602
Breacher, stop.

516
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:52,900
Your vibe blasts don't work.

517
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:58,444
And they're not gonna work.

518
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:00,741
Why not?

519
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:03,487
Because of your age.

520
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:06,789
I should've told you earlier.

521
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:10,077
It's just I know
how special our powers are,

522
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:13,254
and you were so happy
at the thought of having them back.

523
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,922
And I miss your daughter.

524
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,299
I just wanted to see her again.

525
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,836
I'm sorry, Josh.

526
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:26,509
I hate you.

527
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:35,943
You did the right thing.

528
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:40,323
Yeah.

529
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,194
Thanks.

530
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:47,242
Just wish he knew that.

531
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,625
Clifford is lying to you.

532
00:27:53,714 --> 00:27:56,252
He is drugging you with sedative tears

533
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,957
to keep you idle.

534
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,881
Please.

535
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:03,471
Please, remember.

536
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:06,470
Escape.

537
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:13,981
New lemonade recipe...

538
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:18,903
It already exists.

539
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:29,323
<i>Please, don't forget, he's lying to you.</i>

540
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:31,916
<i>He's drugging you.</i>

541
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:34,664
<i>He's a monster.</i>

542
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:36,087
<i>You must escape.</i>

543
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:38,873
You always save it
under the same name.

544
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,549
<i>Escape now.</i>

545
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:44,050
Every time you discover it.
It's quite clever, really.

546
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:47,215
I would expect nothing less from you.

547
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:51,811
How many times have I been through this?

548
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:53,429
Too many.

549
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,186
But that is of no concern.

550
00:28:57,236 --> 00:29:01,071
Because with tears from the Weeper
mixed with Dominic Lanse's powers,

551
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:04,240
I can alter your memory.

552
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:06,905
So that's why you created the Weeper.

553
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:09,404
You didn't need a potential host, he...

554
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:10,534
Worked for you, yes.

555
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:14,125
I knew that the same thing
in you that I fell in love with

556
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:16,043
had the potential to destroy us.

557
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:18,708
Your humanity.

558
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:23,836
I couldn't let that get
in the way of us achieving our goal.

559
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:25,803
The enlightenment.

560
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:27,425
Clifford, I am your wife.

561
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:38,062
And I love you.

562
00:29:43,073 --> 00:29:46,237
But you are nothing without me.

563
00:30:05,846 --> 00:30:08,133
This is an interesting place
to hang out.

564
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:12,137
You come here to suck
the fun out of being benched?

565
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:13,558
I...

566
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:16,016
No, I came for your help, actually.

567
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:20,066
You want help from the guy
who can't take anything seriously?

568
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:21,688
Look, I'm sorry.

569
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:24,149
I shouldn't have been
so quick to judge, uh...

570
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,318
But with DeVoe

571
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,777
so many steps ahead of us,

572
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:33,366
just to see you joking around
in the middle of this,

573
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:36,074
it just made me feel like
you weren't taking it seriously.

574
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,496
I know this is serious.

575
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:46,259
I watched...
I watched Izzy die in front of me.

576
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:50,930
I'm scared out of my mind.

577
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:54,721
Well, you know,
you got an odd way of showing it.

578
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:57,724
Yeah, well, not everybody grew up
with a super-dad like Joe West,

579
00:30:57,814 --> 00:30:59,555
who makes it easy
to talk about your feelings.

580
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:06,275
When I was 10 years old,
my dad walked out on me and my mom.

581
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:08,273
And I was terrified.

582
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:11,609
But my mom, she was even more afraid.

583
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:15,454
So, you know,
I just started making jokes.

584
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:19,500
Started doing stupid gags
and funny bits and...

585
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:23,580
Whoopee cushions.
Anything to push her fear away.

586
00:31:25,092 --> 00:31:27,880
And the thing is after a while,
I started to push my fear away, too.

587
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:30,678
I had no idea, Ralph, I...

588
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,598
It's not that I don't care
about beating DeVoe.

589
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:37,184
It's not that I don't care
about being a great hero.

590
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:39,846
It's just that ever since then,

591
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:42,603
anytime that I'm afraid,
I either hide...

592
00:31:44,361 --> 00:31:45,477
Or I make jokes.

593
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:50,949
<i>Barry, we found Null,
Central City Museum.</i>

594
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:53,651
So what do you say?
You wanna get off the bench?

595
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,077
I really could use your help.

596
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:57,450
Well, if duty calls.

597
00:31:57,541 --> 00:32:00,204
- You get it?
- Yeah. Let's just go, all right?

598
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:24,307
Now this is my kind of party.

599
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:30,154
Listen up, people.

600
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,450
Anything that shines,
shimmers or sparkles,

601
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:35,822
goes in the bag.

602
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:40,456
Ooh, I love me some sapphires.

603
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:43,743
You're out of your mind
if you think I'm giving this to you.

604
00:32:44,004 --> 00:32:47,122
Oh, give it to me? No, no, no, no, no.

605
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:49,628
There's no need for that. No.

606
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:51,879
I'll just take it.

607
00:32:57,392 --> 00:33:00,851
And the rest of you? Sparklies.

608
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:07,229
Just hold on, all right? Just hold on.

609
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:12,147
It's over, Null.

610
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,489
So, back again.

611
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:16,238
Oh, with a friend.

612
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:18,035
A good friend, actually.
We hang out on the weekends,

613
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:19,703
I know where he liv...

614
00:33:20,457 --> 00:33:22,494
- No getaway cars this time?
- Right.

615
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:24,037
No cars.

616
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:27,086
But there are an awful lot
of passengers.

617
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:36,212
Oh, my God. She's gonna send
everyone into the atmosphere.

618
00:33:36,306 --> 00:33:38,138
Allen, you gotta get
everyone out of there right now.

619
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:44,937
All right, that's everyone.
Where is she?

620
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:48,899
- Whoa.
- No!

621
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:50,856
Looking fly, Flash!

622
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:52,986
Back to business.

623
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:54,734
Oh, God!

624
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:08,289
Guys, I can't reach him!

625
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:10,755
Cisco, you have to breach him somewhere.

626
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,923
He's too high in the atmosphere,
I don't have aim like that.

627
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:17,470
- Let Ralph improvise.
- What?

628
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:21,095
- What?
- Yes, do something Dibny-esque,

629
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,016
be your own hero, just do it fast.

630
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,638
Uh, "Dibny-esque," right. Um...

631
00:34:27,691 --> 00:34:29,478
Okay.

632
00:34:29,693 --> 00:34:30,934
All about that bling.

633
00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:41,694
Ralph!

634
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:45,114
That was your plan?
He's gonna fall to his death.

635
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:47,541
- I know what I'm doing.
- Any time, Ralph!

636
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:51,791
10,000 feet, he's falling fast.
Now, 5,000 feet.

637
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:16,729
Ralph did it.

638
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:22,572
Nice work, Ralph.

639
00:35:23,163 --> 00:35:24,324
Nice work.

640
00:35:28,585 --> 00:35:29,621
Classy.

641
00:35:31,713 --> 00:35:32,954
You've gotta be kidding me.

642
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,836
Ralph.

643
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:49,058
All right, Null's in the pipeline.
She's not too happy about it.

644
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:51,973
Well, she's a lot safer there
than she is on her own.

645
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:53,979
Just one more bus meta out there.

646
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:56,026
We better find him before DeVoe does.

647
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:58,897
Where's Harry?
Isn't he supposed to be working on it?

648
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:01,357
He grumbled something
about something and then left.

649
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:04,444
I'm fluent in Harry grumble.
He said he was gonna work on his cap.

650
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:07,450
Or he was making himself a turkey wrap.

651
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,207
Well, I'm gonna head over
to C.C.P.D., do some more digging

652
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:11,625
on this Edwin Gauss.

653
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:15,663
Ralph.

654
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:20,172
Why did a scared-sounding
Earl Cox call me saying

655
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:21,672
he was clearing your tab?

656
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:27,175
I have no idea.
That's really weird.

657
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:37,185
Hey, guys, would you, uh,
help me in the speed lab?

658
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:38,523
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

659
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:39,774
We're gonna go work on some improv?

660
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,571
Yeah.

661
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,697
You were great out there tonight, man.

662
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:47,490
Thank you.

663
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,866
I had a lot of help.

664
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:51,624
And I had a great teacher.

665
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,826
You've helped me realize that

666
00:36:54,421 --> 00:36:57,004
I can't always take everything
so seriously,

667
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:58,297
even when it comes to Thinker.

668
00:36:58,842 --> 00:37:02,552
Wait a second, are you telling me
that I, Ralph Dibny,

669
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:06,130
taught Barry Allen,
superhero extraordinaire, a lesson?

670
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,807
- What could this mean?
- Means you're a great hero.

671
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,302
And you make this team
better by being on it.

672
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:13,137
Ah, the circle is now complete.

673
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,847
When I came here, I was but the learner,

674
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:16,273
now I am the master.

675
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:17,858
It's also good to be humble.

676
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:18,980
But how can I be humble...

677
00:37:20,864 --> 00:37:22,446
When I am swollen with pride?

678
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:40,414
- Cisky.
- Ah, jumpin' jellyfish!

679
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:45,461
I like your new threads.

680
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:47,763
Yeah.

681
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:49,340
I went back to my Earth.

682
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:53,226
Saw my reflection in my knife.

683
00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:56,389
I saw an older man.

684
00:37:56,733 --> 00:37:59,316
I'm curious. Have you never
looked in a mirror before?

685
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:02,645
- I'm not a teenage girl.
- Okay, you're not a teenage girl.

686
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:05,072
But I realized,

687
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,653
time to hang up my coat.

688
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:10,448
This is my new uniform.

689
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,287
- Like it?
- Yeah.

690
00:38:12,582 --> 00:38:13,914
Retirement suits you.

691
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:17,288
So, what do you do with all this time?

692
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:19,453
There's a dragon farm

693
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:23,086
on Earth-47 that I have
always wanted to visit.

694
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:24,967
A dragon farm?

695
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:27,920
Okay, get your Khaleesi on.

696
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:29,425
I'm not a Khaleesi.

697
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:30,848
Okay, you're not a Khaleesi.

698
00:38:30,934 --> 00:38:33,722
But, I just wanted to tell you, Cisky,

699
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:35,390
goodbye forever.

700
00:38:39,526 --> 00:38:41,518
Oh, wait, just one more thing.

701
00:38:42,529 --> 00:38:43,645
Now that I've retired,

702
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,980
there's an opening
at the collection agency.

703
00:38:46,366 --> 00:38:49,074
I would like you to replace me.

704
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:51,907
Wait, I'm... I'm confused.

705
00:38:53,623 --> 00:38:55,159
You wanna see my daughter more?

706
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:56,994
Work with her.

707
00:38:57,377 --> 00:39:01,621
Together, you and Cynthia
could be an unstoppable duo.

708
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:03,547
So what do you say, Vibe?

709
00:39:04,384 --> 00:39:06,046
You wanna be the new Breacher?

710
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,057
How was your rest, my love?

711
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:20,730
Wonderful. I've never felt
more rejuvenated

712
00:39:20,817 --> 00:39:22,524
and ready to realize our dream.

713
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:23,600
Clifford.

714
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:29,694
The added combination of dark matter
from all our subject metas is

715
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:32,401
overwhelming this host's body.

716
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:34,361
How long do we have?

717
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:36,071
At the present rate,

718
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:38,999
exactly one week's time.

719
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,952
No, I will not allow it.

720
00:39:42,255 --> 00:39:44,998
It may be possible to adjust
the biomass index,

721
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:49,005
re-calibrate the energy distribution,
extend your current host's life.

722
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,303
Odd.

723
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:57,093
There are already plans for such
an adjustment partially designed.

724
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:01,559
I attempted the same course of action.

725
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,312
Well, you got quite a good start.

726
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:08,437
I will be able to complete the designs
in under an hour.

727
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:11,031
Rest, my love.

728
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:12,862
I will handle everything.

729
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:17,078
You always do.

730
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:22,293
And then, when you complete your work,
we will continue

731
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:26,543
on our journey to find
the remaining two bus metas.

732
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:29,959
Team Flash has captured Subject 11.

733
00:40:30,637 --> 00:40:34,927
Now, it's time for us to act.

734
00:41:40,707 --> 00:41:42,164
<i>Good evening, Dr. Wells.</i>

735
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:45,414
<i>It's been 1,078 days since
we last spoke.</i>

736
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:47,119
<i>How can I be of service?</i>

737
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:48,454
Hello, Gideon.

738
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:52,625
A lot has changed since then.

739
00:41:52,649 --> 00:42:00,649
