00:00:01,467 --> 00:00:05,137
<i>In 2166, an immortal tyrant
named Vandal Savage</i>

3
00:00:05,139 --> 00:00:07,773
<i>conquered the world
and murdered my wife and child.</i>

4
00:00:07,775 --> 00:00:10,609
<i>I have assembled an elite team
to hunt him throughout time</i>

5
00:00:10,611 --> 00:00:12,311
<i>and stop his rise to power.</i>

6
00:00:12,313 --> 00:00:14,680
<i>Unfortunately, my plan
is opposed by the body</i>

7
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:17,749
<i>I'd sworn my allegiance to,
the Time Masters.</i>

8
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:20,185
<i>In the future, my friends
may not be heroes,</i>

9
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:21,920
<i>but if we succeed,</i>

10
00:00:21,922 --> 00:00:25,424
<i>they will be remembered
as legends.</i>

11
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:29,628
<i>Previously
on "Legends of Tomorrow"...</i>

12
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,163
I was her.

13
00:00:31,165 --> 00:00:32,864
Tragedy or heartbreak.

14
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:36,568
That's how it always ends
if the man's not Carter.

15
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,203
Time master Druce?

16
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:39,671
You and your band
of rogues have run rampant

17
00:00:39,673 --> 00:00:40,839
<i>throughout history.</i>

18
00:00:40,841 --> 00:00:42,474
This is why we work alone, Rip.

19
00:00:42,476 --> 00:00:44,209
A team is a liability.

20
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:46,411
The Time Masters have issued
omega protocols on all of us.

21
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:48,343
- They've sent the Pilgrim.
- Who's the Pilgrim?

22
00:00:48,349 --> 00:00:51,216
The Pilgrim is the time
masters' most deadly assassin.

23
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:53,185
She's hunting
our younger selves.

24
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,490
Kaylex Druzan,
you have been found guilty

25
00:00:58,492 --> 00:01:01,693
of time piracy
in the first degree

26
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:06,265
and sentenced to death
via omega protocol.

27
00:01:06,267 --> 00:01:09,668
The Pilgrim has made contact
with your younger self.

28
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:14,687
This will all be over quickly.

29
00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:30,656
Well done.
Here's your next assignment.

30
00:01:30,658 --> 00:01:33,759
These individuals
have manipulated the timeline

31
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:37,462
without authorization
on multiple occasions.

32
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:39,364
You are hereby ordered to hunt

33
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:41,933
down these individuals'
younger selves

34
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,235
and eliminate them.

35
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:52,911
This isn't my element.

36
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:54,646
It's mine.

37
00:01:54,648 --> 00:01:56,782
Just keep a weather eye open
for the Pilgrim.

38
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:58,617
Gideon calculates a 97% chance

39
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,252
that she will attack
your younger self

40
00:02:00,254 --> 00:02:02,321
in this exact time and place.

41
00:02:02,323 --> 00:02:03,322
Roll it.

42
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,996
Young Rory's not in there.

43
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:13,565
But we found his parents.
They're dead.

44
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:15,033
Then where the hell is he?

45
00:02:31,785 --> 00:02:33,618
Come with me
if you want to live.

46
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,520
I always wanted to say that.

47
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,566
- That's younger you?
- What'd you tell him?

48
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:49,828
That we work for a secret
agency called A.R.G.U.S.

49
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:51,670
- I think he bought it.
- Course he did.

50
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:53,638
He's an idiot.

51
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,006
Hey, no offense,

52
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,768
but do you really think
it's a good idea

53
00:02:56,777 --> 00:02:58,377
to leave him unsupervised?

54
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:00,976
You're right.

55
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:01,981
Have fun.

56
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You seem calm.

57
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,416
What, you mean considering
a temporal bounty hunter

58
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:07,486
is trying to murder
our younger selves?

59
00:03:07,488 --> 00:03:09,048
I was gonna put it a little
more delicately

60
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:10,622
than that, but yeah.

61
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:12,324
I think at some point,

62
00:03:12,326 --> 00:03:14,326
you just learn to live
with a sword over your head.

63
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,368
Either you're getting better
or I'm getting lazy.

64
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,570
So it seems like you decided
to ignore the advice

65
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:27,739
from old west you
about not being with Ray.

66
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:30,442
Ignoring her advice about Ray
was your advice, remember?

67
00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:32,511
Don't listen to my advice.

68
00:03:32,513 --> 00:03:34,780
So did you tell him
what she said?

69
00:03:34,782 --> 00:03:35,982
Oh, sure.

70
00:03:35,983 --> 00:03:36,983
"Hey, Ray, by the way,

71
00:03:36,984 --> 00:03:39,518
"the woman I met in 1871 was me.

72
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,380
"And she told me our love
was doomed to fail

73
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:43,888
- because you're not Carter."
- So that was a no?

74
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:45,757
Look, Ray and I
are happy together.

75
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,492
We should be able to enjoy that
before I have to drop the whole

76
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:49,494
doomed-love-affair thing
on his head.

77
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:50,726
Yeah, I mean,

78
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,061
who wants a relationship
based on honesty

79
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,425
and communication?

80
00:03:53,434 --> 00:03:55,064
- Ugh.
- Believe me.

81
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:56,929
A relationship based
on an ancient Egyptian curse

82
00:03:56,937 --> 00:03:58,470
doesn't work much better.

83
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:01,907
Mr. Rory.
How are you feeling?

84
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,875
I mean, your younger self.

85
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:05,644
Jax is watching him.

86
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:07,846
That young man, you,
just lost his family.

87
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:10,015
You might want
a shoulder to cry on.

88
00:04:10,017 --> 00:04:11,450
I don't cry, Professor.

89
00:04:11,452 --> 00:04:13,018
Oh, and, haircut,
thanks for saving me.

90
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,920
You're welcome.

91
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:17,122
You know what I don't get
is why doesn't the Pilgrim just

92
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:18,884
go back a week earlier
and kill younger Rory then?

93
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:20,692
'Cause the omega
protocol calls for precision.

94
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:22,024
Multiple attempts
from the Pilgrim

95
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:23,895
could do irreparable
temporal damage.

96
00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:25,430
Which means
she's only got one shot

97
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,065
at killing each
and every one of us.

98
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:29,434
And we only have one shot
to extract your younger selves

99
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,937
from the timeline
before she pulls the trigger.

100
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:34,005
<i>Sir, based
on the temporal wake generated</i>

101
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:35,173
<i>by the Pilgrim's time ship,</i>

102
00:04:35,175 --> 00:04:37,075
<i>I calculate a 96% likelihood</i>

103
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:40,011
<i>that she is heading
to Starling City circa 2007.</i>

104
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:42,080
Pilgrim is targeting
Miss Lance.

105
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:49,020
Name?

106
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:51,590
Lance.
Sara Lance.

107
00:04:51,592 --> 00:04:53,992
This is ridiculous.
Come on.

108
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:55,861
I thought it was take
your daughter to work day.

109
00:04:55,863 --> 00:04:57,963
Yeah,
if I was in grade school.

110
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,931
"Daddy, I'm doing a paper
on the criminal justice system.

111
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:01,566
I want to see what it looks
like on the inside".

112
00:05:01,568 --> 00:05:04,135
Well, I didn't mean
inside a jail cell.

113
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,470
Too bad, 'cause
that's the next stop

114
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:06,972
on our little tour.

115
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:08,874
I think you're enjoying
this a little too much.

116
00:05:08,876 --> 00:05:10,942
Honey, it's the dream
of every father

117
00:05:10,944 --> 00:05:13,111
to keep their daughters
locked up until they're 30.

118
00:05:13,113 --> 00:05:15,580
Maybe even 40.

119
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:18,683
What the...

120
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:36,469
Daddy!

121
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:43,909
Get out of here.
Get out of here!

122
00:05:43,911 --> 00:05:45,011
Go, go, go!

123
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:27,016
- My God, she's...
- Quite the badass.

124
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:40,832
I put her in the cargo bay
with mini-you,

125
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:42,564
told them both to stay put.

126
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,235
The less they know
what's going on, the better.

127
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,104
You sure you want
to leave daddy's little girl

128
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:47,672
with that punk?

129
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:49,107
Even before the league
of assassins,

130
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:50,875
I knew how to handle
guys like you.

131
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:53,178
Has Gideon figured out
the Pilgrim's next target yet?

132
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,614
- That's peculiar.
- Peculiar or bad?

133
00:06:55,616 --> 00:06:56,881
Gideon, run another scan

134
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:58,984
for the whereabouts
of the Pilgrim.

135
00:06:58,986 --> 00:07:00,685
<i>I'm sorry, sir.</i>

136
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:02,654
<i>The timeline shows
no temporal distortions.</i>

137
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:04,689
<i>I seem to be unable
to track the Pilgrim.</i>

138
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:05,924
That doesn't sound good.

139
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:08,026
No, it's quite the opposite.

140
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:09,958
Without a way to track
the whereabouts of the Pilgrim,

141
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:13,023
she could target
any one of you

142
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:14,763
at any point in time.

143
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,300
Gideon was tracking
the Pilgrim's temporal wake.

144
00:07:21,303 --> 00:07:22,733
I didn't think it was possible

145
00:07:22,738 --> 00:07:24,468
to conceal one's movements
through time.

146
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:26,470
Well, it is if the time
masters are on your side.

147
00:07:26,514 --> 00:07:27,914
How does this all work?

148
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:30,015
If she can travel
to any place at any time,

149
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,350
she could be killing
any of us right now.

150
00:07:32,386 --> 00:07:34,886
- And if we die in the past...
- We die in the present.

151
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:36,688
Wow. So interesting.

152
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,590
How long does it take for
what happens in the past

153
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:40,625
to affect the present?

154
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,193
Could I be dead right now
and not know it?

155
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:44,362
Maybe I am dead right now.

156
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:46,064
Hello? Can anybody hear me?

157
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:47,666
No.

158
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:49,067
Look, the important
thing is not to panic.

159
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:50,335
Somebody's playing
Russian roulette

160
00:07:50,337 --> 00:07:51,336
with our younger selves.

161
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:52,971
Why would we panic?

162
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:54,272
Well, there are
a few exceptions.

163
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:55,840
Kendra's ability to reincarnate

164
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:57,275
means that it would
do the Pilgrim

165
00:07:57,277 --> 00:07:58,977
no good to target her.

166
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,845
And as a former Time Master,

167
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:02,847
to remove me from history

168
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:05,684
would be quite dangerous
to the timeline.

169
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:07,318
Well, that's convenient.

170
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,653
And what's that supposed
to mean?

171
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:09,654
Nothing.

172
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,022
It just occurs to me

173
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:13,925
you've never told us
about your past, Rip.

174
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:16,361
And I don't trust
a man with secrets.

175
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:19,230
Look, the less information
you have to offer on me,

176
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:20,732
the less valuable

177
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:22,967
you are to our now
numerous enemies.

178
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:25,770
Like I said, convenient.

179
00:08:25,772 --> 00:08:27,839
- Are they fighting?
- This is not a fight.

180
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,741
It's merely
an exchange of ideas.

181
00:08:29,743 --> 00:08:31,042
No, not you. Them.

182
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:34,379
Ah-ha!

183
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:35,380
She slapped me.

184
00:08:35,382 --> 00:08:36,815
The little weirdo said

185
00:08:36,817 --> 00:08:38,149
that he liked the way
that I smelled.

186
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:39,651
I'm usually a lot smoother,

187
00:08:39,653 --> 00:08:41,152
but I'm sort of
freaking out right now.

188
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:43,121
You, hands to yourself.

189
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:45,156
The next time, hit
with a flat palm.

190
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:48,426
And you... You're not her type.

191
00:08:48,428 --> 00:08:50,061
Now, do I need
to separate you two?

192
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,798
No.

193
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,967
Hey, when do I get to go home?

194
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:57,168
You're safer here.

195
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,269
Trust me.

196
00:08:58,271 --> 00:08:59,771
Well, where is here?

197
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:01,906
And why do you look like me?

198
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:04,109
Please, will you just tell me
what the hell's going on?

199
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:06,711
Look, it's safer
for you if I don't.

200
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:09,748
And we look alike, because...

201
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,349
because we're like family.

202
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:13,852
And I need you to trust me.

203
00:09:13,854 --> 00:09:16,688
Look, my dad,
he's got to be freaking out.

204
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:17,689
If he ever lost me...

205
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:20,091
he won't lose you.

206
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:22,961
Ever.

207
00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:24,229
I promise.

208
00:09:32,472 --> 00:09:33,972
Hey.

209
00:09:33,974 --> 00:09:35,306
Hey.

210
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:37,308
Did you know that Rip
has a secret stash

211
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,910
of vintage cereals?

212
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,411
Fruit brute was always
my favorite.

213
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,247
Are you okay?

214
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:44,783
I'm a little on edge.

215
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:46,484
You know, we've been
through a lot together,

216
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:50,088
and you've never quite resorted
to eating sugary cereals.

217
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:54,459
Look, I've spent a lot
of my life

218
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:55,960
thinking about the future.

219
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:58,429
And now, I have to think
about the past,

220
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,831
which is sometimes the present.

221
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:02,100
And...

222
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:04,402
The point is, do you know

223
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:06,237
where I go to
when things get crazy?

224
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:08,139
Which for us is always.

225
00:10:10,744 --> 00:10:12,777
I go to those two years
in hub city,

226
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:13,845
when it was just you and me,

227
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:17,515
and it felt like we had forever.

228
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:18,917
Yeah.

229
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:22,020
That's what kept me grounded.

230
00:10:22,022 --> 00:10:23,922
In fact...

231
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:27,826
Seconds before Rip
and the team came back,

232
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:29,027
I was about...

233
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,029
Ray!

234
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:35,033
What's wrong?

235
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,136
Oh, my god.

236
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:39,470
Gideon, we need help!

237
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,274
What's happening to him?

238
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:46,044
<i>He is suffering
from severe internal injuries.</i>

239
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:51,983
Who's doing this?

240
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,518
<i>A deep scan
of Mr. Palmer's timeline</i>

241
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,919
<i>reveals a temporal anomaly</i>

242
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:57,155
<i>on December 19, 2014,</i>

243
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,023
<i>in the vicinity
of Palmer technologies.</i>

244
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:00,892
The Pilgrim.

245
00:11:00,894 --> 00:11:02,954
Gideon, get us
to that location now!

246
00:11:12,806 --> 00:11:15,206
- Who are you?
- I'm no one.

247
00:11:15,242 --> 00:11:16,507
We have that in common.

248
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,450
We need to get you to cover.

249
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:28,053
What is that thing?
Who is she?

250
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:29,054
Who are you?

251
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:33,892
No time to explain.

252
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:42,066
No.

253
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:43,428
Rip and the team
are saving you in the past,

254
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:45,136
and I'm here now.

255
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:47,098
However long we have, I want
to spend it with you.

256
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:51,442
My suit.

257
00:11:59,853 --> 00:12:01,452
It works.

258
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:07,292
<i>Mr. Palmer's
vitals are stabilizing.</i>

259
00:12:07,294 --> 00:12:08,993
They did it.

260
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:12,463
Actually, I think you get most
of the credit.

261
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:15,266
I couldn't miss spending
the rest of our lives together.

262
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:18,937
I meant it, Ray.

263
00:12:21,374 --> 00:12:22,974
I love you.

264
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:24,609
I guess you found the ring.

265
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:26,577
The ring?

266
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:36,454
Kind of a strange way
to get engaged, but...

267
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,525
I'll take it.

268
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,160
What the Pilgrim did, the way

269
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:49,628
she turned our attacks
back on us,

270
00:12:49,736 --> 00:12:51,296
it was as if she was
reversing time.

271
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:52,934
It's called
temporal micro-manipulation.

272
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:55,539
The ability to control time
in one's immediate vicinity.

273
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:58,242
We are lucky to have
saved Dr. Palmer.

274
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:01,678
So basically we have no idea
who she's going after next.

275
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:04,411
We know it's not Rip,
because he doesn't have a past

276
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:05,917
to go back to.

277
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,285
Gideon, prepare
for multiple time jumps.

278
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,687
Plot points here, here and here.

279
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,191
My birthday?
Why are we...

280
00:13:13,193 --> 00:13:15,360
the only way to ensure
you're not harmed in your past...

281
00:13:15,362 --> 00:13:18,096
is to abduct ourselves
as newborns,

282
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:20,298
thus removing ourselves
from our future timelines.

283
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,399
It's brilliant.

284
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:22,667
It's morally questionable.

285
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:25,003
It's suicidal.

286
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:26,704
If we take too long
in getting them home...

287
00:13:26,706 --> 00:13:28,373
then history is altered.

288
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:31,442
There won't be a home
to go back to.

289
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:33,011
You'll disappear from the minds

290
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:35,513
of everyone
who's ever known you.

291
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:37,682
You mean,
my own mom won't even know me?

292
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:39,517
My wife.

293
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,386
Yeah, and my...

294
00:13:41,388 --> 00:13:42,687
oh, yeah.

295
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:44,655
I don't have anyone.

296
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,658
Sure as hell beats dying.

297
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,462
<i>Hey.</i>

298
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:53,564
Hey.

299
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:55,099
How's Ray?

300
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:56,434
Fine.

301
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:58,102
Um, his younger self
is in the hospital,

302
00:13:58,104 --> 00:14:00,738
so our Ray is healing
rather quickly.

303
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:03,508
You know, you don't seem
too happy about it.

304
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,642
I'm not unhappy.

305
00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:08,346
I'm...

306
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:11,049
I'm engaged.

307
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:12,183
What?

308
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:13,384
Yeah.

309
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:16,621
Ray proposed to me
while he was...

310
00:14:16,623 --> 00:14:18,056
you know what,
it's a long story.

311
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:20,024
But you said yes.

312
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:21,325
At the time.

313
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,430
I... I never thought
about marriage.

314
00:14:25,432 --> 00:14:29,267
I didn't think I was
able to think about marriage.

315
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:33,571
I don't know what to do.

316
00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:35,106
That's hard.

317
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,143
Do you like babies?

318
00:14:39,145 --> 00:14:42,513
Yeah, but that sounds
like doubling down to me.

319
00:14:42,515 --> 00:14:44,015
I need your help.

320
00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:46,584
And then I'll help
you figure out

321
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:48,619
what you should say to Ray.

322
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:49,620
Okay.

323
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:50,655
Let's go.

324
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:04,602
All right, this is just
like any other mission.

325
00:15:04,604 --> 00:15:06,137
The mark may be a newborn,

326
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:07,805
but it might as well
be a diamond or a microchip.

327
00:15:07,807 --> 00:15:09,273
You know what?

328
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:11,142
You're starting
to sound like Snart.

329
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:12,410
Ugh.

330
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:16,414
Okay, which one is Snart?

331
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,616
Look for the one with horns.

332
00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:19,817
Found him.

333
00:15:19,819 --> 00:15:21,219
Great, grab him.
Let's go.

334
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:24,322
Well, hello, baby Snart.

335
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:26,190
Look at you.

336
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:28,326
Kendra, come on.
We don't have time for this.

337
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:34,799
Oh, look at those little cheeks.

338
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:36,801
You are the cutest little baby

339
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:38,136
in the world.

340
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:42,673
Poor kid.

341
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:43,841
He's gonna have a rough life

342
00:15:43,843 --> 00:15:46,444
ahead of him.

343
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:47,766
Good thing
we're kidnapping him.

344
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:52,416
What are you doing?

345
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:55,686
I'm getting us out of here.

346
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:58,689
We don't even
know where here is.

347
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:01,092
<i>Identity confirmed.</i>

348
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:03,494
<i>Sara Lance.</i>

349
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:04,795
Let's go.

350
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,631
Where do you think
you're going?

351
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:07,632
Give me that.

352
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:09,400
Inside.

353
00:16:09,402 --> 00:16:11,202
Is that a baby?

354
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:12,637
Yes, and you guys
are in charge of him.

355
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,205
Wait, I...

356
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:16,307
you made five grand
last summer babysitting.

357
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:18,342
You'll be fine.

358
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:20,111
- No, I don't do babies.
- You do now.

359
00:16:20,113 --> 00:16:23,581
Think of it as a thank
you for saving your life.

360
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:26,851
You better not drop my future
criminal partner.

361
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:30,388
Otherwise you're
in trouble, comprende?

362
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,589
Hmm.

363
00:16:34,561 --> 00:16:36,260
We've got Mr. Snart's
younger self.

364
00:16:36,262 --> 00:16:38,829
Next stop is you, Professor,
and you, Mr. Jackson.

365
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:42,233
How strange to imagine,
holding one's infant self.

366
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:43,801
Actually, none of you
should participate

367
00:16:43,803 --> 00:16:45,303
in your own abductions.

368
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:48,773
Let's call it
paradox prevention.

369
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:50,474
It's almost worth the risk.

370
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:52,343
To experience
how our own fathers

371
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,745
must have felt
the day we were born.

372
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:57,582
Yeah, well, not my dad.

373
00:16:57,584 --> 00:17:00,685
He shipped out before my mom
went into labor.

374
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:03,621
Yeah, he died
two weeks later

375
00:17:03,623 --> 00:17:06,324
in Somalia, so...

376
00:17:06,326 --> 00:17:08,426
I'm so sorry.

377
00:17:08,428 --> 00:17:09,627
Yeah.

378
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:23,407
I think I see the head.

379
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:24,642
Oh!

380
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:28,713
Look at that.

381
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:34,352
What do you think
of Jeremy as a name?

382
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:36,721
Oh, I think he looks
more like a Martin.

383
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:38,522
You guys asked
for a doctor, right?

384
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:39,957
Yeah, how would we?

385
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:42,326
He means that we were
on our way to the hospital

386
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:43,728
and we saw your automobile.

387
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:46,964
Yeah, and this little munchkin
needs a checkup.

388
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:50,334
Prenatal care,
it's very important.

389
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:51,769
He means post-natal.

390
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:53,271
We'll take him
straight to the hospital.

391
00:17:53,273 --> 00:17:55,506
We'll meet you there.

392
00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:56,674
What about my wife?

393
00:17:58,344 --> 00:18:00,311
It's somewhat disconcerting
that my father

394
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:02,713
would give me up so willingly
to two complete strangers.

395
00:18:02,715 --> 00:18:05,316
Well, the 1950s was a much
more trusting time.

396
00:18:05,318 --> 00:18:06,751
Trust me, I lived then.

397
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:11,589
- He's not in Somalia.
- Huh?

398
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:13,791
We need to hold off
on taking baby Jefferson.

399
00:18:13,793 --> 00:18:15,960
I need to find grown Jefferson.

400
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:17,495
But Rip said that we...

401
00:18:17,497 --> 00:18:18,929
I doubt very much
that giving the boy

402
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,665
a moment with his
soon-to-be-dead father

403
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:22,300
will do the universe any harm.

404
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:26,404
What are you doing, Gray?

405
00:18:26,406 --> 00:18:27,772
Trust me, Jefferson,
there's someone here

406
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:29,473
I really think you should meet.

407
00:18:34,414 --> 00:18:36,547
Go talk to him.

408
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:38,949
And say what?

409
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,618
Speak from your heart.

410
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:44,021
Go.

411
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:57,568
You were supposed
to be shipping out.

412
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:58,602
How do you know that?

413
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,274
Oh, right.

414
00:19:03,276 --> 00:19:04,536
My transport got delayed.

415
00:19:04,544 --> 00:19:06,604
I told my CO
my wife's giving birth.

416
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:09,912
He got me a pass and a Jeep.

417
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:12,816
And I made it.
I saw him.

418
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:16,387
My boy.

419
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:17,822
Which one's yours?

420
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,459
Oh, oh, no, I'm... I'm...
I'm not a dad.

421
00:19:21,461 --> 00:19:22,727
I just...

422
00:19:22,729 --> 00:19:24,462
I'm here for my family.

423
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:26,997
Well, I hope you get
to experience this

424
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,866
for yourself one day.

425
00:19:28,868 --> 00:19:30,801
Imagining all the things my
boy's gonna be when he grows up.

426
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:33,037
How do you know?

427
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,573
'Cause he's my son.

428
00:19:35,575 --> 00:19:39,076
Jefferson Jackson,
remember that name.

429
00:19:39,078 --> 00:19:40,878
He's destined for great things.

430
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:46,083
I've got to go.

431
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:47,918
Will you give the nurse
a message for my wife?

432
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,453
You're leaving already?

433
00:19:49,455 --> 00:19:51,622
Be AWOL if I don't.

434
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:53,424
I just want her to know
that I saw my son,

435
00:19:53,426 --> 00:19:55,593
and that I couldn't be
more proud and happy.

436
00:19:55,595 --> 00:19:57,728
And tell her I'll be home
as soon as I can.

437
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:58,929
Can you do that?

438
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:06,670
Wait.

439
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:07,905
I got to tell you something.

440
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:16,113
Congratulations.

441
00:20:16,115 --> 00:20:18,616
Thanks.

442
00:20:18,618 --> 00:20:19,650
Appreciate that.

443
00:20:58,524 --> 00:20:59,924
We're here.

444
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:01,525
Where is here?

445
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:03,394
Come, I'll show you.

446
00:21:06,699 --> 00:21:08,766
Again, where is here?

447
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:11,168
We need a safe harbor
to keep your younger selves.

448
00:21:18,878 --> 00:21:21,412
I've been waiting.

449
00:21:21,414 --> 00:21:22,680
It's good to see you.

450
00:21:25,551 --> 00:21:27,718
It is good
to see you too, mother.

451
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:36,861
Don't forget to take
your boots off

452
00:21:36,863 --> 00:21:38,929
before you come back in.

453
00:21:42,735 --> 00:21:44,435
Oi!

454
00:21:44,437 --> 00:21:46,470
Off you go.

455
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:49,607
So, this is where Rip plans
on keeping our baby selves.

456
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:50,975
If all goes
according to plan,

457
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:52,610
we'll only be here
for a few minutes,

458
00:21:52,612 --> 00:21:54,144
then presumably never remember.

459
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,747
When's the last thing
anything went according to plan?

460
00:21:56,749 --> 00:21:58,949
I don't think
there was a last time.

461
00:21:58,951 --> 00:22:00,718
I really would sit up
if I were you.

462
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,553
She'll kill you
if she catches you slouching.

463
00:22:02,555 --> 00:22:03,854
Don't be fooled
by appearances.

464
00:22:03,856 --> 00:22:05,656
That woman is as tough as nails.

465
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:08,025
Funny how you never
mentioned having a mother.

466
00:22:08,027 --> 00:22:09,693
Adoptive mother.

467
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:11,795
Now, can I interest any of you
in some more tea?

468
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:12,796
Thank you.

469
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:13,931
So, Michael...

470
00:22:13,933 --> 00:22:15,966
- Michael?
- That's me.

471
00:22:15,968 --> 00:22:18,068
My birth name.

472
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,104
The Time Masters
insist on the adoption

473
00:22:20,106 --> 00:22:22,006
of new identities
for their protection.

474
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:24,208
How do you know so much
about the Time Masters?

475
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:26,143
I work for them.

476
00:22:26,145 --> 00:22:27,511
Oh, don't worry.

477
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:29,713
My true loyalty
is to my children.

478
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:30,781
Thank you.

479
00:22:30,783 --> 00:22:32,049
The Time Masters
fill their ranks

480
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:33,651
with children, orphans

481
00:22:33,653 --> 00:22:35,152
pulled from throughout
the course of history.

482
00:22:35,154 --> 00:22:36,720
When Michael
arrived at the refuge,

483
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:38,522
he had nothing
but the clothes on his back.

484
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:40,624
There's a reason
it's called the refuge,

485
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:43,827
and a reason that it exists
in a secret location in history.

486
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:45,896
The Time Masters will never
think to look for you here.

487
00:22:45,898 --> 00:22:47,798
Thank you for your assistance.

488
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,533
Look, I know I make a gorgeous
baby, but I should warn you.

489
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:51,268
You've got your hands
full with me.

490
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:53,671
I assure you,
you're not the first tough case

491
00:22:53,673 --> 00:22:55,739
to arrive at my door.

492
00:23:06,084 --> 00:23:07,785
Where'd you find the match?

493
00:23:07,787 --> 00:23:09,520
You can always find them.

494
00:23:09,522 --> 00:23:11,689
Beautiful, isn't it?

495
00:23:11,691 --> 00:23:13,591
Not as beautiful
as a whole house

496
00:23:13,593 --> 00:23:15,859
going up in flames, though.

497
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:19,029
- It was an accident.
- Sure it was.

498
00:23:19,031 --> 00:23:21,131
You don't know me.

499
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:23,000
You think I wanted
to kill my family?

500
00:23:23,002 --> 00:23:26,236
I think you fell in love
with your dad's lighter fluid.

501
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:30,741
I think you fell in love
with the flames dancing around.

502
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:32,710
But then you realized
you couldn't control them,

503
00:23:32,712 --> 00:23:36,580
and you ran without
waking your family.

504
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:37,881
The only thing

505
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:41,919
you were concerned about
was your own skin.

506
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:44,922
Now, while I'm gone,

507
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:47,224
there better not be
any accidents.

508
00:23:47,226 --> 00:23:51,128
If there is, I'm gonna
come looking for you.

509
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,830
I'm gonna kill you.

510
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:55,199
You sound just like my dad.

511
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:12,883
I couldn't quite bring myself
to leave this place just yet.

512
00:24:12,885 --> 00:24:15,853
I've made you something
for your travels.

513
00:24:15,855 --> 00:24:18,889
Some mince pies
for your friends.

514
00:24:18,891 --> 00:24:20,691
My friends.

515
00:24:20,693 --> 00:24:22,192
They're the people
whose relationships

516
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:23,627
with their friends and family

517
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:25,796
I've put at risk
to save my family.

518
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:27,264
You think you've been selfish?

519
00:24:27,266 --> 00:24:30,267
- I do, yes.
- What a load of old codswallop.

520
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:32,069
I've always known

521
00:24:32,071 --> 00:24:34,271
that you were brought to me
for a reason, Michael.

522
00:24:34,273 --> 00:24:36,240
That you were ready
for great things,

523
00:24:36,242 --> 00:24:38,702
but you won't accomplish
anything by wallowing.

524
00:24:38,711 --> 00:24:40,241
So for goodness' sake,
pull yourself out of it

525
00:24:40,246 --> 00:24:41,746
- and get the job done.
- And what about you?

526
00:24:41,747 --> 00:24:43,380
I have put you
in terrible danger.

527
00:24:43,382 --> 00:24:44,882
You don't honestly
think I'd let

528
00:24:44,884 --> 00:24:46,617
you go away
with my best serving dish

529
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:49,720
if I didn't think
I'd see you again, do you?

530
00:24:49,722 --> 00:24:51,789
I can manage quite happily

531
00:24:51,791 --> 00:24:54,992
with a house full
of 10-year-old Time Masters,

532
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:57,161
so I think I can perfectly deal
with the adult version.

533
00:24:57,163 --> 00:24:58,829
Go on!

534
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:02,066
Yes, yes.
Thank you.

535
00:25:16,414 --> 00:25:18,816
Jefferson?

536
00:25:18,818 --> 00:25:19,817
Hey.

537
00:25:19,819 --> 00:25:21,218
What's up, man, we good?

538
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,353
Oh, please.
We share a psychic connection.

539
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,823
I know how you're feeling,
and I'm sorry.

540
00:25:25,825 --> 00:25:27,658
I thought affording you time
with your father

541
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,793
would lift your spirits.

542
00:25:29,795 --> 00:25:30,828
Yeah.

543
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:34,064
I... I thought so too.

544
00:25:34,066 --> 00:25:35,933
I just...

545
00:25:35,935 --> 00:25:37,801
I should have said something.

546
00:25:37,803 --> 00:25:40,070
I should've told him about what
happens to him in Mogadishu.

547
00:25:40,072 --> 00:25:41,705
I could've saved him.

548
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:42,740
You don't know that.

549
00:25:42,742 --> 00:25:44,374
It's highly unlikely

550
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,710
you could've said anything
that would've changed his fate.

551
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:48,812
My whole life,

552
00:25:48,814 --> 00:25:50,914
everything good I ever did,

553
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:52,249
every report card,

554
00:25:52,251 --> 00:25:54,051
every touchdown,
in the back of my mind,

555
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:57,221
I always wondered, what would
my dad think about this?

556
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:09,733
Hey.

557
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:10,968
Hey.

558
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,469
I was just on my way
to the bridge.

559
00:26:12,471 --> 00:26:13,804
No, wait.

560
00:26:13,806 --> 00:26:16,173
Wait, please.

561
00:26:16,175 --> 00:26:17,341
I didn't mean to be a lurker,

562
00:26:17,343 --> 00:26:20,210
but I heard you
and Sara talking.

563
00:26:20,212 --> 00:26:23,046
And I get it.
You thought I was dying.

564
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:24,882
You told me
what I needed to hear.

565
00:26:24,884 --> 00:26:26,283
And it worked.

566
00:26:26,285 --> 00:26:29,253
So if you need a reason,

567
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:30,487
a way to let me down easy...

568
00:26:30,489 --> 00:26:32,089
Ray, no.

569
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:33,991
I want to be with you.

570
00:26:36,427 --> 00:26:40,097
It's just that I know
that we can't last.

571
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:41,365
Says who?

572
00:26:41,367 --> 00:26:44,334
Me.

573
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:48,972
The woman I met in 1871...

574
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:50,474
Was me.

575
00:26:50,476 --> 00:26:52,843
And she warned me

576
00:26:52,845 --> 00:26:54,845
that it would end
in heartbreak

577
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:56,980
if I ever tried
to be with someone...

578
00:26:56,982 --> 00:26:59,850
other than Carter.

579
00:26:59,852 --> 00:27:02,052
God, this is just too
complicated.

580
00:27:02,054 --> 00:27:06,056
No, it isn't, really.

581
00:27:06,058 --> 00:27:08,425
I mean, if I make you happy,

582
00:27:08,427 --> 00:27:09,927
if being with me
makes you happy,

583
00:27:09,929 --> 00:27:12,462
then you can be happy.

584
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:15,799
Or you can choose to listen
to some former version

585
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:19,803
of yourself
who believes in curses.

586
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:22,840
When you decide,
let me know.

587
00:27:25,044 --> 00:27:28,145
<i>Everyone please report
to the main deck immediately.</i>

588
00:27:30,082 --> 00:27:31,415
What's going on?

589
00:27:31,417 --> 00:27:33,984
Gideon has intercepted
a trans-chronal beacon.

590
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:36,520
Gideon, show them.

591
00:27:36,522 --> 00:27:39,456
<i>This message
is for Rip Hunter.</i>

592
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:43,026
<i>I'm going to make this
very quick and very simple.</i>

593
00:27:46,866 --> 00:27:50,067
<i>If I can't find you,</i>

594
00:27:50,069 --> 00:27:51,368
<i>I can find those you love.</i>

595
00:27:55,975 --> 00:27:57,040
Anna?

596
00:27:58,377 --> 00:27:59,409
Dad!

597
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:01,211
<i>All of them will suffer</i>

598
00:28:01,213 --> 00:28:03,146
<i>and die because of you.</i>

599
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:07,351
<i>Your family, friends, anyone
you've ever cared about.</i>

600
00:28:07,353 --> 00:28:11,088
<i>Unless you surrender
your younger selves to me.</i>

601
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:13,590
So she can erase you
all from history.

602
00:28:13,592 --> 00:28:17,060
<i>If it's of any comfort,
you won't feel a thing.</i>

603
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:19,429
<i>As for your loved ones,</i>

604
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:22,132
<i>I cannot promise
the same thing.</i>

605
00:28:34,078 --> 00:28:35,946
Gideon, I take it

606
00:28:35,948 --> 00:28:38,348
that the Pilgrim's transmission
included a carrier frequency

607
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:39,983
through which
she can be contacted?

608
00:28:39,985 --> 00:28:41,118
<i>Yes, Captain.</i>

609
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,853
Hail her, please.

610
00:28:42,855 --> 00:28:44,021
What are you planning to do?

611
00:28:44,023 --> 00:28:45,322
<i>Captain Hunter.</i>

612
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:46,423
Look, I'm gonna
make this easy.

613
00:28:46,425 --> 00:28:47,991
<i>I already have.</i>

614
00:28:47,993 --> 00:28:49,426
<i>The lives
of your team's nearest</i>

615
00:28:49,428 --> 00:28:51,194
<i>and dearest
for their younger selves.</i>

616
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:52,930
And I'm gonna counter
that demand

617
00:28:52,932 --> 00:28:55,065
with an offer of my own.

618
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:56,566
I will surrender myself

619
00:28:56,568 --> 00:29:00,103
if you spare the lives
of my crew and their loved ones.

620
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:01,471
<i>A noble gesture.</i>

621
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:03,407
<i>But worthless.</i>

622
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:07,544
<i>My directive is to eliminate
your entire team, not just you.</i>

623
00:29:07,546 --> 00:29:11,882
Yes, well,
I'm not talking about me now.

624
00:29:11,884 --> 00:29:13,951
I'm offering you me in the past.

625
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:20,422
Rip Hunter before he became
a Time Master.

626
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:24,526
Eliminate him, and this team
will never have been.

627
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:27,632
<i>If this is some kind
of trick...</i>

628
00:29:27,633 --> 00:29:30,633
It's no trick.

629
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:35,272
Enough people have died
at my expense.

630
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:37,674
Gideon will send you
the location.

631
00:29:37,676 --> 00:29:41,111
And, Mr. Snart, your wish
is about to come true.

632
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:43,413
You're going to meet
my younger self.

633
00:29:48,354 --> 00:29:50,287
- What is this place?
- Neutral ground.

634
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:52,422
It's a defunct
Time Masters outpost.

635
00:29:52,424 --> 00:29:55,092
I thought we were supposed to
be picking up your younger self.

636
00:29:55,094 --> 00:29:57,394
He's being brought
to us, actually.

637
00:30:00,065 --> 00:30:03,700
That little boy
was at the refuge.

638
00:30:03,702 --> 00:30:06,570
He's you.

639
00:30:06,572 --> 00:30:08,205
You got my message?

640
00:30:08,207 --> 00:30:11,208
I don't approve
of what you're planning.

641
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:13,243
Not that it ever
stopped you before.

642
00:30:13,245 --> 00:30:16,179
Your younger selves
are all still safe and sound.

643
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:17,981
Thank you.

644
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:19,149
You're a naughty one.

645
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:20,550
That's right.

646
00:30:24,356 --> 00:30:27,224
I think it's probably
about time that you left.

647
00:30:27,226 --> 00:30:30,627
Give her hell.

648
00:30:30,629 --> 00:30:32,262
Where's my dad?

649
00:30:32,264 --> 00:30:35,232
On board my ship,
along with the rest.

650
00:30:35,234 --> 00:30:37,367
All in perfect condition...

651
00:30:37,369 --> 00:30:39,669
As long as your Captain
honors his end of our bargain.

652
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:40,971
You'd murder a child?

653
00:30:40,973 --> 00:30:42,272
I'd murder as many children

654
00:30:42,274 --> 00:30:44,107
as is necessary
to accomplish my mission.

655
00:30:44,109 --> 00:30:46,043
Do you know what this will do
to the timeline,

656
00:30:46,045 --> 00:30:47,110
killing a Time Master?

657
00:30:47,112 --> 00:30:48,311
In case you've forgotten,

658
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:50,580
I am sanctioned
by the Time Masters

659
00:30:50,582 --> 00:30:53,116
to do what my former colleague
Chronos here failed to do.

660
00:30:53,118 --> 00:30:54,451
Enough of that.

661
00:30:57,222 --> 00:31:00,424
Let's get down to business.

662
00:31:00,426 --> 00:31:02,092
Where's the rest
of your group?

663
00:31:02,094 --> 00:31:03,360
They're around.

664
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:08,365
I'll be taking the boy.

665
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:09,633
Before you do that,

666
00:31:09,635 --> 00:31:12,335
we don't believe
for a second

667
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:14,204
their loved ones
are on your ship.

668
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:16,640
A show of good faith, then.

669
00:31:16,642 --> 00:31:18,608
A prisoner exchange.

670
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:21,078
Send the boy,
and I'll send the father.

671
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,413
Once I have the future
Captain Hunter in my possession,

672
00:31:23,415 --> 00:31:27,050
then I'll release the rest.

673
00:31:29,455 --> 00:31:32,389
- What the hell's going on?
- You don't need to understand.

674
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:33,590
Only walk.

675
00:31:35,561 --> 00:31:37,594
You are gonna
be absolutely fine.

676
00:31:37,596 --> 00:31:38,695
I promise.

677
00:31:46,305 --> 00:31:47,537
As soon
as my dad's in the clear,

678
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:49,739
let's light this up.

679
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:52,109
Remember,
we wait for Ray's cue.

680
00:32:00,452 --> 00:32:01,618
I'm in position.

681
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,353
You wanted to see me?

682
00:32:03,355 --> 00:32:05,388
Have I done
something wrong, Miss?

683
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:07,057
Not yet.

684
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:08,425
Now!

685
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:14,831
Fool me once.

686
00:32:34,486 --> 00:32:35,619
Now, Kendra!

687
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:26,803
I was willing to proceed
in good faith.

688
00:33:26,805 --> 00:33:31,374
Now you'll watch
those closest to you die.

689
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:35,445
Thought you could
snuff me out?

690
00:33:35,447 --> 00:33:38,415
You don't know me at all, Miss.

691
00:33:56,734 --> 00:33:59,236
Hey, are you okay?

692
00:33:59,238 --> 00:34:00,770
Not really.

693
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:02,505
Yeah, let me explain.

694
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:09,579
You poor boy.

695
00:34:09,581 --> 00:34:11,581
I'll take you.

696
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:13,617
Are you all right?

697
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:15,885
That's you.

698
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,722
Yeah.

699
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:20,457
I was a cutpurse
from the age of five.

700
00:34:20,459 --> 00:34:23,960
Starved more than I ate.

701
00:34:23,962 --> 00:34:27,230
I knew what I'd do
if she tried to harm me.

702
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:29,899
Lucky for us,
you didn't forget your roots.

703
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:32,269
Believe me, Mr. Snart,

704
00:34:32,271 --> 00:34:33,670
I've tried.

705
00:34:45,516 --> 00:34:46,683
There you are.

706
00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:49,986
The Pilgrim
may have been dealt with,

707
00:34:49,988 --> 00:34:52,489
but the omega protocol
is still in effect.

708
00:34:52,491 --> 00:34:54,357
I'll look after your friends,
don't worry.

709
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:56,226
Oh, I know you will, mum.

710
00:34:56,228 --> 00:34:58,428
You did the same for me.

711
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,696
It must be strange

712
00:34:59,698 --> 00:35:01,464
for you to see yourself
as you were.

713
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:02,899
Hmm.

714
00:35:02,901 --> 00:35:04,901
Do you remember the first day
you were here?

715
00:35:04,903 --> 00:35:06,603
Yes, I think
I tried to steal your purse.

716
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:09,239
God, I was a mean
little bastard.

717
00:35:09,241 --> 00:35:11,474
- You were tough.
- I was selfish.

718
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:13,843
Well, you were surviving.

719
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:17,280
I was home.

720
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:19,883
Which is why I know
you'll be back.

721
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:32,028
Here to give me

722
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:34,030
another "don't burn down
the house" speech?

723
00:35:34,032 --> 00:35:35,799
You think by hurting yourself,
it's gonna

724
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:38,034
make you feel better
about the fire?

725
00:35:38,036 --> 00:35:39,803
You don't know anything
about me, man.

726
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:41,671
Guess again, kid.

727
00:35:41,673 --> 00:35:42,806
I'm you.

728
00:35:42,808 --> 00:35:44,507
What?

729
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:47,711
That's right.

730
00:35:47,713 --> 00:35:50,313
You're too young to understand.

731
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:52,349
But understand this.

732
00:35:52,351 --> 00:35:53,650
It wasn't your fault.

733
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:00,724
I let that flame
get out of control,

734
00:36:00,726 --> 00:36:02,792
like you said.

735
00:36:02,794 --> 00:36:07,530
I ran out without
waking anybody, like you said.

736
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:10,567
I was just so afraid.

737
00:36:10,569 --> 00:36:13,903
You were just a kid.

738
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:17,440
I spent my whole life
blaming you,

739
00:36:17,442 --> 00:36:21,344
hating you for something
you didn't mean to do.

740
00:36:23,048 --> 00:36:24,647
Why are you telling me this?

741
00:36:27,085 --> 00:36:29,819
You can't change the things
you did.

742
00:36:29,821 --> 00:36:31,855
But you can change
what you become.

743
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:36,359
Don't be like me.

744
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:37,694
Be better.

745
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,566
Clarissa, it's me, Martin.

746
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:44,834
I'm sorry,
you look so familiar,

747
00:36:44,836 --> 00:36:46,035
but I just can't place you.

748
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:48,705
Spaceship?

749
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:50,006
What next, martians?

750
00:36:50,008 --> 00:36:52,942
No, actually, amnesia pill.

751
00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:54,477
Oh, yeah.

752
00:36:54,479 --> 00:36:56,946
This will just
wipe your short-term memory.

753
00:36:56,948 --> 00:36:58,782
Of course, it's up to you,
but we don't want

754
00:36:58,784 --> 00:37:01,851
to mess with time too much.

755
00:37:01,853 --> 00:37:04,788
Mmm.

756
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:06,489
I always knew
that you'd end up

757
00:37:06,491 --> 00:37:08,958
caring for people,

758
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,561
protecting people.

759
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:13,963
Well,
I learned it from my dad.

760
00:37:16,935 --> 00:37:17,967
Proud of you, honey.

761
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:27,677
Is everything all right?

762
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:30,113
My wife
doesn't seem to remember me.

763
00:37:30,115 --> 00:37:32,148
Because until we return
your younger selves

764
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:34,384
to the timeline, you...

765
00:37:34,386 --> 00:37:36,786
none of you will
have ever existed.

766
00:37:36,788 --> 00:37:38,721
But we will return you.

767
00:37:38,723 --> 00:37:40,557
When we left 2016,

768
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:43,493
I just assumed I would return
to the exact moment I left,

769
00:37:43,495 --> 00:37:45,662
that Clarissa wouldn't even know
I was gone.

770
00:37:45,664 --> 00:37:49,165
So I didn't say good-bye.

771
00:37:49,167 --> 00:37:51,801
And now I fear I will never
have that chance.

772
00:37:51,803 --> 00:37:52,802
You will.

773
00:37:52,804 --> 00:37:54,471
Look, I've told you before

774
00:37:54,473 --> 00:37:56,873
that I am not going
to risk your marriage

775
00:37:56,875 --> 00:37:58,675
in order to save my wife.

776
00:37:58,677 --> 00:38:01,144
I promise you that.

777
00:38:01,146 --> 00:38:02,946
Thank you.

778
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:04,981
Not even gonna pretend
to understand any of this.

779
00:38:04,983 --> 00:38:07,050
It's pretty crazy, huh?

780
00:38:09,153 --> 00:38:12,021
That was you in the hospital,

781
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:14,824
on the day you were born.

782
00:38:14,826 --> 00:38:18,127
And earlier, on fire.

783
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,462
Amazing.

784
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:21,731
Where'd you learn those moves?

785
00:38:21,733 --> 00:38:23,166
From my dad.

786
00:38:25,837 --> 00:38:28,705
You know, the day
you were born in the hospital,

787
00:38:28,707 --> 00:38:30,673
I'd never been so scared.

788
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:33,576
I mean, even in combat.

789
00:38:33,578 --> 00:38:37,714
But now, I know
for you to be the man

790
00:38:37,716 --> 00:38:41,584
I see standing here,
I must do something right.

791
00:38:41,586 --> 00:38:43,786
I can't wait to be there
to watch it happen.

792
00:38:46,224 --> 00:38:48,558
Dad, listen.

793
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,593
On September 26th,

794
00:38:50,595 --> 00:38:52,829
you're gonna be deployed
along the k4 circle.

795
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:55,598
Keep your head
on a swivel for an IED.

796
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:59,068
You know this beca...

797
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,837
you're from the future.

798
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:03,606
Please.
Promise me you'll be careful.

799
00:39:10,782 --> 00:39:13,016
I'll be back soon, okay?

800
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:18,955
Hey.

801
00:39:18,957 --> 00:39:21,024
Hey.

802
00:39:21,026 --> 00:39:24,794
Hope you don't mind,
my fiancé...

803
00:39:24,796 --> 00:39:28,131
My other fiancé
is in our quarters, resting.

804
00:39:28,133 --> 00:39:30,867
Yeah, no, that's...
That's fine.

805
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:31,868
Hey, I'm sorry.

806
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,536
No, really, it's fine.

807
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:35,505
No, I-I mean,

808
00:39:35,507 --> 00:39:36,873
being at death's door

809
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:39,709
is not the right time
to pop the question.

810
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:43,146
Look, when you proposed,

811
00:39:43,148 --> 00:39:45,615
I was so afraid of losing you.

812
00:39:45,617 --> 00:39:47,216
And then facing the Pilgrim,

813
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:50,753
I realized there is never
going to be

814
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:52,288
a right time for this.

815
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:56,559
So we should stop waiting
for the right time.

816
00:39:58,028 --> 00:39:59,028
I don't understand.

817
00:40:06,104 --> 00:40:09,806
I want to marry you, Ray.

818
00:40:09,808 --> 00:40:12,041
I mean it.

819
00:40:17,816 --> 00:40:19,983
How's your sister?

820
00:40:19,985 --> 00:40:21,050
She's a tough kid.

821
00:40:21,052 --> 00:40:22,552
How's your dad?

822
00:40:22,554 --> 00:40:25,121
Sleeping off that amnesia pill
from Rip.

823
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:30,593
Hey.

824
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:31,861
I might have just stopped my dad

825
00:40:31,863 --> 00:40:33,997
from getting killed
in Mogadishu.

826
00:40:33,999 --> 00:40:35,665
I just thought I should tell you

827
00:40:35,667 --> 00:40:37,967
in case there's
a time paradox or whatever.

828
00:40:37,969 --> 00:40:40,670
Well, as I've been saying, Mr.
Jackson, time wants to happen.

829
00:40:40,672 --> 00:40:43,039
Yeah, I know.
But I had to try.

830
00:40:43,041 --> 00:40:45,775
And perhaps what time wants

831
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:48,578
is to see you
and your father back together.

832
00:40:50,215 --> 00:40:51,981
Ugh.

833
00:40:51,983 --> 00:40:55,118
Just pulled younger me's head
from out of his ass.

834
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,586
I'm not sure it stuck.

835
00:40:56,588 --> 00:40:58,054
Me either.

836
00:40:58,056 --> 00:40:59,355
Then I saw younger Rip change,

837
00:40:59,357 --> 00:41:01,157
and I thought,
why not give it a shot?

838
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:03,259
Surprised you didn't advise
your teenage self

839
00:41:03,261 --> 00:41:05,128
to not get on a certain boat.

840
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:07,163
- Yeah, me too.
- Yak, yak, yak.

841
00:41:07,165 --> 00:41:08,831
I thought we were
on a clock here.

842
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:10,733
Indeed we are.

843
00:41:10,735 --> 00:41:12,135
Time, the history

844
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:16,172
from which your younger selves
were removed,

845
00:41:16,174 --> 00:41:21,044
is beginning to set...

846
00:41:21,046 --> 00:41:22,376
As is evidenced by the change

847
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,980
- in Clarissa's memory.
- Okay.

848
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:25,842
So how long do we have till
these changes stick?

849
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:27,083
No one knows.

850
00:41:27,085 --> 00:41:28,251
Which is why we need
to move swiftly

851
00:41:28,253 --> 00:41:29,952
to locate Vandal Savage

852
00:41:29,954 --> 00:41:32,155
if any of your lives
are to be restored to normal.

853
00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:33,723
So how long
will it take to determine

854
00:41:33,725 --> 00:41:34,857
a new location for Savage?

855
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:36,192
Longer than we have.

856
00:41:36,194 --> 00:41:38,294
Fortunately, there is
one place in time

857
00:41:38,296 --> 00:41:40,296
that we know Savage to be.

858
00:41:40,298 --> 00:41:42,832
You said he conquered
the world in 2166.

859
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:44,634
You also said
it was too dangerous

860
00:41:44,636 --> 00:41:46,369
to strike at Savage while he was
at the height of his powers.

861
00:41:46,371 --> 00:41:48,071
That it is.

862
00:41:48,073 --> 00:41:51,174
But with your younger selves
removed from history,

863
00:41:51,176 --> 00:41:55,945
we have quite literally
run out of time.

864
00:42:19,937 --> 00:42:21,304
<i>Greg, move your head!</i>
