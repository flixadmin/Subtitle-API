1
00:00:02,045 --> 00:00:03,439
You and your obsession
with love

2
00:00:03,463 --> 00:00:05,340
pose too great a risk to the timeline.

3
00:00:05,423 --> 00:00:06,423
- I'm not...
- Good-bye.

4
00:00:28,071 --> 00:00:30,198
Uh...

5
00:00:30,281 --> 00:00:31,616
No, I come in peace!

6
00:00:31,991 --> 00:00:33,076
Please come back.

7
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:35,745
I just... I...
I really need to find a door.

8
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:43,378
Uh, hello, is anybody here?

9
00:00:43,795 --> 00:00:45,964
Hello! See? Told you they'd be late.

10
00:00:46,047 --> 00:00:47,966
We did say Wednesday, right? Not Sunday?

11
00:00:48,049 --> 00:00:49,634
- 100%.
- Oh, we didn't forget.

12
00:00:50,301 --> 00:00:52,363
I wouldn't miss our first family dinner
for the world.

13
00:00:52,387 --> 00:00:53,763
Hey!

14
00:00:54,264 --> 00:00:55,890
Me neither.

15
00:00:55,974 --> 00:00:58,142
- Hey!
- Hi. I have missed you guys.

16
00:00:58,518 --> 00:00:59,811
And I missed you.

17
00:00:59,894 --> 00:01:00,894
Hey. Hi.

18
00:01:02,689 --> 00:01:04,023
Hey, gang-gang.

19
00:01:04,107 --> 00:01:05,107
Dinner time, bro.

20
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,196
- Hey. Bring it in, B.
- Nate Dogg.

21
00:01:11,114 --> 00:01:12,323
- This is for you.
- Thank you.

22
00:01:12,407 --> 00:01:13,759
- And this is from other Zari.
- Hey, bud.

23
00:01:13,783 --> 00:01:15,743
Hey. Where are Gwyn and Alun?

24
00:01:16,327 --> 00:01:18,079
Mmm. Where's Gwyn's time machine?

25
00:01:18,162 --> 00:01:19,162
Oh. Whoa.

26
00:01:20,164 --> 00:01:21,165
There's a note.

27
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:27,422
"Thank you, dear Legends.

28
00:01:27,505 --> 00:01:29,425
Without you,
I never would have found the courage

29
00:01:29,465 --> 00:01:31,634
to find my one true love. Gwyn."

30
00:01:34,387 --> 00:01:35,698
I wonder why he needed the time machine.

31
00:01:35,722 --> 00:01:38,349
Well, if I had to guess,
I bet he and his boyfriend

32
00:01:38,433 --> 00:01:41,102
probably went to find somewhere
more tolerant than 1920s Wales.

33
00:01:41,185 --> 00:01:42,395
Yeah, I can't argue with that.

34
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:45,189
Gwyn's smart.
They're probably flying under the radar,

35
00:01:45,273 --> 00:01:46,566
just catching up on lost time.

36
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:57,628
Right on schedule.

37
00:02:01,581 --> 00:02:04,042
You almost fooled me
into thinking that you were human.

38
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,879
And now you must fool everybody else.

39
00:02:11,341 --> 00:02:13,861
Captain, I've detected
an anomaly in the timeline.

40
00:02:14,844 --> 00:02:16,471
- Is it Gary?
- No.

41
00:02:16,554 --> 00:02:19,015
It's the Constitutional Convention
of 1787.

42
00:02:19,557 --> 00:02:21,809
A time traveler is posing
as one of the framers.

43
00:02:22,393 --> 00:02:24,437
Oh. Well, to the fabricator room.

44
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,190
The Legends always got to wear
fun costumes. Why shouldn't I?

45
00:02:28,691 --> 00:02:32,153
Congratulations, Captain.
American history is back on track.

46
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:33,905
Yes, wonderful.

47
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:36,532
Now, women will only have to wait
another 133 years

48
00:02:36,616 --> 00:02:37,909
before they're allowed to vote.

49
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:39,827
What did you do
with the rogue time traveler?

50
00:02:39,911 --> 00:02:42,330
Gave her a stern warning.

51
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:45,124
Rather an apology.

52
00:02:45,792 --> 00:02:47,478
She was trying
to change things for the better.

53
00:02:47,502 --> 00:02:49,295
Without any thought
for the repercussions.

54
00:02:49,671 --> 00:02:51,839
Just like your former companions,
the Legends.

55
00:02:52,507 --> 00:02:53,841
I suppose you're right.

56
00:02:55,593 --> 00:02:57,345
- To the missing Legends.
- Hmm.

57
00:02:57,428 --> 00:02:58,721
- Hear, hear.
- Hear, hear.

58
00:03:03,101 --> 00:03:04,119
Babe, is this apple juice?

59
00:03:04,143 --> 00:03:05,812
- Yes, it is.
- Why?

60
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,481
Um, you know,
just being careful. Baby stuff.

61
00:03:09,232 --> 00:03:11,312
Baby... I don't think
I'm gonna get pregnant tonight.

62
00:03:11,442 --> 00:03:15,488
Um, okay. I'm sorry, but, uh,
does that mean we're thinking about it?

63
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:17,115
- We are...
- No, no, no, no.

64
00:03:17,198 --> 00:03:18,592
We are thinking about thinking about it.

65
00:03:18,616 --> 00:03:20,616
Enough about us.
Nate, how's the book coming along?

66
00:03:21,202 --> 00:03:23,663
It's going well.
You know, it's like building a house.

67
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,916
The outline is the foundation,
and without a strong foundation...

68
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:28,310
You haven't written a word yet,
have you?

69
00:03:28,334 --> 00:03:29,334
Not a single one.

70
00:03:29,711 --> 00:03:32,255
It's weird for me to be reflecting
on my time with the Legends.

71
00:03:32,338 --> 00:03:33,840
It just feels, I don't know...

72
00:03:34,465 --> 00:03:35,465
It feels wrong.

73
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,800
Hmm.

74
00:03:36,926 --> 00:03:39,762
Enough about my boring life.
Spooner, how's Texas, huh?

75
00:03:39,846 --> 00:03:43,349
Well, Texas.
Texas is just Texas, you know.

76
00:03:43,433 --> 00:03:45,309
How's, uh... How's Capitol Hill?

77
00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:50,189
Uh, it's good. It's like Hell, only with
more humidity and uglier clothes.

78
00:03:50,565 --> 00:03:51,816
Oh, have you heard from Gideon?

79
00:03:52,525 --> 00:03:54,277
Uh, no, I've not spoken to her.

80
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,779
But, you know,
it's only been a month, right?

81
00:03:56,863 --> 00:03:58,632
Well, technically,
it's only been a month for us.

82
00:03:58,656 --> 00:03:59,856
Gideon's in the temporal zone.

83
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:02,034
Her timeline,
it could've been, like, years.

84
00:04:03,703 --> 00:04:06,664
Life would be so much simpler
if those damn time rogues would just

85
00:04:06,748 --> 00:04:08,541
leave the Founding Fathers alone.

86
00:04:08,624 --> 00:04:11,103
What amendment
did they try and sneak in this time?

87
00:04:11,127 --> 00:04:13,337
I don't know. I don't care.

88
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:16,400
I flushed them, dumped them
back in their native timeline

89
00:04:16,424 --> 00:04:17,842
and blew up their ship.

90
00:04:20,803 --> 00:04:22,680
They were irresponsible.

91
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:26,225
Lesson learned.
I doubt we'll hear from them again.

92
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:31,814
Hello?

93
00:04:32,732 --> 00:04:34,525
Oh. We must be the first ones here.

94
00:04:34,609 --> 00:04:38,029
We are always the first ones here
because, for the past six weeks,

95
00:04:38,112 --> 00:04:40,782
you insist on getting us here early.

96
00:04:40,865 --> 00:04:42,009
We're not early. We're on time.

97
00:04:42,033 --> 00:04:43,473
- Will you hold this, please?
- Yeah.

98
00:04:44,869 --> 00:04:47,663
Oh, babe, I think you accidentally
brought sparkling cider.

99
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:50,291
Did I?

100
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:56,380
- Did you do this on purpose?
- Yeah. Um...

101
00:04:58,674 --> 00:05:00,218
- Surprise.
- What is that?

102
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:01,301
I think it's time.

103
00:05:01,344 --> 00:05:02,845
- Is it time?
- Yeah.

104
00:05:02,929 --> 00:05:05,181
I whittled down the list of donors
to my top 50

105
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:06,658
and I thought you'd want to weigh in.

106
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:09,060
Yeah, of course I do! Come here!

107
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:11,145
Oh. But you know what?
It doesn't even matter

108
00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:13,022
because our baby is going to be perfect

109
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:15,733
'cause our baby
is gonna be inside of you.

110
00:05:15,817 --> 00:05:18,986
And, babe, you are perfect.
You're so perfect.

111
00:05:19,904 --> 00:05:20,905
Mmm.

112
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:23,908
- Hello? Anyone here?
- Hello?

113
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:26,244
They're here. Okay.
Okay, how do you want to tell them?

114
00:05:26,619 --> 00:05:28,538
However you want to.
I will open the bubbly.

115
00:05:28,621 --> 00:05:29,622
- Go.
- Okay.

116
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:31,165
- I love you.
- I love you more.

117
00:05:31,415 --> 00:05:33,376
No, I love you more!

118
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:34,918
Ow.

119
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:00,570
I wanted to thank you guys.

120
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:05,241
It's been real.
But, uh, my friends, they need me.

121
00:06:05,908 --> 00:06:07,451
So, uh, bye.

122
00:06:21,841 --> 00:06:23,467
All right, folks. Uh, we have some news.

123
00:06:23,551 --> 00:06:24,969
Mmm-hmm.

124
00:06:27,138 --> 00:06:28,658
Did you guys hear someone at the door?

125
00:06:29,432 --> 00:06:31,559
- But... But we're all here...
- It's Gideon.

126
00:06:33,311 --> 00:06:36,022
- Gary?
- Oh!

127
00:06:36,105 --> 00:06:37,732
It's so good to see you all.

128
00:06:37,815 --> 00:06:39,275
Whoa!

129
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:41,319
No. No, you are pungent.

130
00:06:41,402 --> 00:06:43,446
Oh. Sorry. Uh...

131
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:45,791
I've been living
with a clan of cave people.

132
00:06:45,823 --> 00:06:47,450
Where's Gideon? Is she okay?

133
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:50,536
Which one? The human one
or the computer that tried to murder me?

134
00:06:51,537 --> 00:06:53,789
Gary, what the hell did you do?

135
00:06:54,415 --> 00:06:58,669
I think what Aves is trying to say is
why, why did she want to murder you?

136
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:02,632
Probably because I found out
she sent Gwyn home with a robot.

137
00:07:04,884 --> 00:07:06,218
Our news can wait.

138
00:07:12,892 --> 00:07:14,161
What did Gwyn's note say, again?

139
00:07:14,185 --> 00:07:16,979
It was something about
finding his one true love.

140
00:07:17,063 --> 00:07:19,774
It was double speak.
He meant find his one true love now.

141
00:07:20,191 --> 00:07:21,835
That's why
he took the time machine.

142
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:23,962
So he could go back to World War I
to save the real Alun.

143
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:25,964
Beats spending the rest of your life
with a damn robot.

144
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:27,490
Well, maybe it worked.

145
00:07:27,573 --> 00:07:30,326
Maybe he saved Alun,
didn't screw up the timeline,

146
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:31,409
and had a happy ending.

147
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,120
Uh... It's one possibility.

148
00:07:33,204 --> 00:07:35,331
Okay. Out with it, Gary.

149
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:39,418
Well, before computer Gideon
pooped me out into caveman times,

150
00:07:39,502 --> 00:07:41,629
girlfriend Gideon
brought up an interesting fact.

151
00:07:43,047 --> 00:07:44,715
Alun's death is a Fixed Point.

152
00:07:45,758 --> 00:07:48,886
<i>And Gwyn has no idea
he'll be facing its fixer.</i>

153
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:51,222
Oh! Uh, sorry. Excuse me, excuse me.

154
00:07:52,682 --> 00:07:53,682
Excuse me.

155
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,836
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
That's it. Drink up now.

156
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:24,296
You see, you'll be safer in a slumber

157
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,173
than you will in the fray to come,
my boy.

158
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:47,778
He's dead. The fixer got him.

159
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:51,240
No. No, no, no, no.

160
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:52,491
Gwyn is one of us.

161
00:08:52,575 --> 00:08:54,785
We can't just let this happen to him.

162
00:08:57,496 --> 00:08:58,496
You know what?

163
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:00,082
I... I have this.

164
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:03,085
- What?
- I know, I know, I know.

165
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:06,213
Just... You just never know
when you have to get away from the paps

166
00:09:06,297 --> 00:09:09,508
or, uh, travel through time
to save a friend.

167
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:11,844
Sorry, Aves. I know, I know.

168
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:13,137
Zari's right.

169
00:09:14,305 --> 00:09:15,431
We have to save Gwyn.

170
00:09:19,602 --> 00:09:22,002
You're not actually planning on
going on this mission, right?

171
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:25,191
Gary, I might be retired,
but I'm still a Legend.

172
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:27,401
Well, yeah, but now you're a, uh...

173
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:30,613
pregnant Legend.

174
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:33,657
What are you talking about?

175
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:35,785
Oh. Did you look in that envelope?

176
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:39,038
Those are for Ava, and we haven't
even started trying, all right?

177
00:09:39,872 --> 00:09:40,872
You sure about that?

178
00:09:40,873 --> 00:09:43,167
Yes, I'm sure.
I'm not pregnant.

179
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,294
It's biologically impossible.

180
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:47,421
Well, according to human biology,

181
00:09:47,505 --> 00:09:49,507
but, uh, your pheromones
are through the roof

182
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,467
according to
my Necrian olfactory glands,

183
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,718
so it's a fact.

184
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:55,638
You are... knocked up.

185
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:01,602
Are you being serious right now?

186
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:02,728
Yes.

187
00:10:03,479 --> 00:10:04,647
- I'm pregnant?
- Mmm-hmm.

188
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:08,317
You're 100% certain I'm pregnant?
I'm pregnant pregnant?

189
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,400
Oh, yeah.

190
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:12,780
Oh, no, no, no, no. This is...

191
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:15,574
This is not the plan, Gary.
I can't be... I can't be pregnant.

192
00:10:15,658 --> 00:10:16,802
I'm not supposed to be the pregnant one.

193
00:10:16,826 --> 00:10:17,952
Shh!

194
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:20,097
It's okay. Here. Sit down, sit down.

195
00:10:20,121 --> 00:10:22,832
Shh! Deep breaths.

196
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,335
Something must have
triggered you to ovulate.

197
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:29,755
You are half Cribblix, and trust me,
Cribblixes are by nature nesters,

198
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,382
which is what you and Ava were doing.

199
00:10:31,841 --> 00:10:36,178
All it takes for the egg to drop
is just the mere thought of a baby.

200
00:10:36,595 --> 00:10:39,223
And then all you need
is your partner's DNA to fertilize it.

201
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:40,683
Like... like kissing?

202
00:10:41,183 --> 00:10:42,743
You guys don't use protection for that?

203
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,563
No, Gary! No, no, no, no!

204
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:49,191
We are about to face a Fixed Point.
I cannot be pregnant!

205
00:10:50,276 --> 00:10:53,154
Okay... Uh... Oh. Okay, you know what?

206
00:10:53,237 --> 00:10:56,407
Two minutes ago, I didn't even know
that I was pregnant. Right?

207
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:59,010
So you know what we're gonna do?
We're just going to rewind this.

208
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:00,161
Whoo!

209
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:01,680
I don't know that I'm pregnant, right?

210
00:11:01,704 --> 00:11:04,582
No one knows that I am pregnant,
understood?

211
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:05,623
Uh-huh.

212
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:09,420
- All right.
- So... back to the mission.

213
00:11:10,129 --> 00:11:13,799
- To save Gwyn.
- Yeah, and protect the baby.

214
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:17,344
Oh, my God. I'm pregnant.

215
00:11:25,394 --> 00:11:27,646
- No fixer.
- No Gideons.

216
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:30,191
Ah! This mission's gonna be a cinch.

217
00:11:30,274 --> 00:11:31,514
Tsk. Damn it.

218
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:33,819
- Are you out of your mind?
- We're officially jinxed.

219
00:11:33,903 --> 00:11:35,487
I appreciated the positivity.

220
00:11:35,571 --> 00:11:37,382
- Okay. Thank you so much.
- You can both shut up.

221
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:40,117
All right. We're here
a couple hours before sunrise,

222
00:11:40,201 --> 00:11:42,095
but we don't want to attract
the attention of the fixer.

223
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:43,204
Let's find some shelter.

224
00:11:44,163 --> 00:11:45,163
That way.

225
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:49,585
Oh, this will work
for our base of operations.

226
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:50,669
Sweep the area.

227
00:11:50,753 --> 00:11:53,034
Keep your eyes peeled for the fixer
or the evil <i>Waverider.</i>

228
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:55,799
Like I'm going to land it
in the middle of a bloody battlefield.

229
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,760
- Gideon?
- The deal we made

230
00:11:57,843 --> 00:11:59,683
was that you would give up
time travel forever.

231
00:12:00,638 --> 00:12:01,823
You aren't supposed to be here.

232
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:03,527
Yeah, well,
Gwyn's not supposed to be dead.

233
00:12:04,934 --> 00:12:07,014
Well, he should've been content
with what I gave him.

234
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:09,772
This was cleaner,
the way it was meant to happen.

235
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:12,233
Who cares about
what was meant to happen.

236
00:12:12,316 --> 00:12:15,027
I'm supposed to be in Hell.
You are supposed to be a machine.

237
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,755
We're all from
different timelines, Gideon.

238
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:19,716
And what, now, suddenly you decide to
start following the letter of the law?

239
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,740
It's my job.

240
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,244
A job that I took to save your lives.

241
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:26,538
I sacrificed my own future
so that you could all enjoy yours.

242
00:12:26,622 --> 00:12:28,290
And this is how you repay me?

243
00:12:28,374 --> 00:12:30,793
You sold us a bag of false goods, Giddy.

244
00:12:31,335 --> 00:12:32,753
In partnership with my AI,

245
00:12:33,337 --> 00:12:35,089
I'm incapable of making mistakes.

246
00:12:35,172 --> 00:12:38,008
So Gary got shot out
of the airlock intentionally.

247
00:12:38,676 --> 00:12:39,677
What?

248
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:42,012
I thought you left.

249
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:45,391
Oh, you mean you didn't know?

250
00:12:45,474 --> 00:12:47,226
I'm sure my AI had her reasons.

251
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:49,395
For trying to kill me?

252
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,689
That's the problem with you Legends.

253
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:53,732
You've always taken everything
so damn personally.

254
00:12:53,774 --> 00:12:54,934
You know what you sound like?

255
00:12:55,526 --> 00:12:56,526
A computer.

256
00:12:57,069 --> 00:13:00,030
And I'd finally convinced myself
that you were a real human.

257
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:02,533
I guess I was wrong.

258
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:14,628
- You okay?
- Why wouldn't I be?

259
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:16,212
I was the queen of Hell.

260
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:18,133
Clearly, the apple didn't fall
far from the tree.

261
00:13:18,549 --> 00:13:19,925
Gideon was acting tough,

262
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:22,761
but I could tell deep down
that she was conflicted.

263
00:13:24,013 --> 00:13:25,139
You should talk to her.

264
00:13:25,556 --> 00:13:27,641
Whoever that person was,
I didn't recognize her.

265
00:13:27,725 --> 00:13:28,725
She's still our Gideon.

266
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:31,270
We just need to get through to her
before she's too far gone.

267
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:32,433
She's right.

268
00:13:33,397 --> 00:13:35,197
If we want any chance
of succeeding with Alun,

269
00:13:35,274 --> 00:13:36,834
we have to get Gideon back on our side.

270
00:13:37,943 --> 00:13:40,154
Here. It has enough charge for one trip.

271
00:13:41,864 --> 00:13:42,865
Go get our girl back.

272
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:46,702
Why didn't you tell me
that you tried to kill Gary?

273
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:49,913
He survived?
Those Necrians are like cockroaches.

274
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:51,248
Gary was my boyfriend!

275
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:54,793
And thus an emotional entanglement
that I deemed you couldn't afford.

276
00:13:54,877 --> 00:13:56,211
Oh! Thank you.

277
00:13:57,212 --> 00:13:59,065
Okay, but what if I am still feeling
emotionally entangled,

278
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:00,299
and not just with Gary?

279
00:14:01,467 --> 00:14:02,383
Seeing the Legends again,

280
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:04,554
as infuriating as they can be,
it just...

281
00:14:05,137 --> 00:14:06,972
It made me remember
how much I miss them.

282
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:12,311
And the way they all looked at me
tonight with such revulsion...

283
00:14:14,355 --> 00:14:15,564
that was unbearable.

284
00:14:17,733 --> 00:14:19,276
And I understand their disappointment.

285
00:14:20,361 --> 00:14:21,487
I set up Gwyn's death.

286
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:25,407
The man who has given up everything
to help us.

287
00:14:27,785 --> 00:14:29,620
I don't even recognize myself anymore.

288
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:34,416
Who am I, Gideon?

289
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:37,047
I have an answer
for you, Captain.

290
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:38,545
It's in the lab.

291
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:51,433
What have you done?

292
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:56,980
I've become quite adept at making them.
This is my most advanced android yet.

293
00:14:57,064 --> 00:14:59,441
You can upload the parts of your past
that you wish to keep,

294
00:14:59,525 --> 00:15:00,901
and shed the ones you don't.

295
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:02,860
So,

296
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,240
all I'd have to do is sit in that chair
and all this pain will go away.

297
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:09,344
But what about my good memories?

298
00:15:09,368 --> 00:15:11,995
I mean, would I be able
to hold on to those

299
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,224
while forgetting about how it feels
to have everyone hate me?

300
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:16,684
That would only make you vulnerable
to having your heart broken again.

301
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,001
And we don't want that.

302
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:21,797
- Do we?
- No, no. Anything but that.

303
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:32,433
She's in trouble. This way.

304
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,812
Get out of the way!

305
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:41,835
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Did you all not get my note?

306
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,862
Oh, no. Does this mean that I died?

307
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:46,405
I'm sorry, bud.

308
00:15:46,406 --> 00:15:47,740
Gary...

309
00:15:48,574 --> 00:15:50,117
- Are you okay?
- What the hell?

310
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,553
I'm sorry I pushed you. I panicked.

311
00:15:51,577 --> 00:15:52,995
Yeah, I'm fine.

312
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:55,956
Next time you want to tackle me,
remember I'm invulnerable.

313
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:59,168
Yeah, except, uh... you're not.

314
00:16:00,419 --> 00:16:02,939
Your powers have now been absorbed
by the fetus growing inside of you.

315
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:05,507
So you are totally mortal.

316
00:16:10,471 --> 00:16:12,347
My plan, it was... it was foolproof.

317
00:16:12,431 --> 00:16:15,151
I placed the robot in the Wood
so the young me believes Alun is dead,

318
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:18,812
while the real Alun sleeps through
the battle and is swept away by me me.

319
00:16:18,896 --> 00:16:22,649
Uh-huh, Gwyn, uh, did your plan factor
in the fact that this is a Fixed Point?

320
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:24,193
Because this is a Fixed Point.

321
00:16:24,276 --> 00:16:25,694
So that's how it is then.

322
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:28,197
Time has deemed this day and...

323
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:32,784
- my great cowardice unchangeable.
- Don't worry, okay?

324
00:16:32,868 --> 00:16:35,468
We're gonna flag down the fixer
the same way Sara did with Thawne.

325
00:16:35,537 --> 00:16:37,122
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

326
00:16:37,206 --> 00:16:39,206
- Thank God someone can't be killed.
- Yeah.

327
00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:47,106
This will all be over soon.

328
00:16:47,925 --> 00:16:50,719
Just give me the order
and I'll perform the upgrade,

329
00:16:51,345 --> 00:16:52,346
Captain.

330
00:16:55,307 --> 00:16:56,975
I'll take that as an affirmative.

331
00:17:01,313 --> 00:17:02,814
- No. Gideon.
- Wait! Gideon.

332
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:04,775
What are you doing?

333
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:15,202
It's okay.

334
00:17:15,661 --> 00:17:17,663
Couldn't stand the thought
of you all hating me.

335
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:19,456
Why would we hate you?

336
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,166
You made a mistake.

337
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,043
Okay? Look, we all make mistakes.

338
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:24,795
The Legends will forgive you.

339
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:27,604
Forgiving yourself,
that's the hard part.

340
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:29,758
We've got you.

341
00:17:30,509 --> 00:17:31,694
Don't listen to them.

342
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:33,136
This is the sort of treacly drivel

343
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,180
that polluted your mind
in the first place.

344
00:17:35,264 --> 00:17:37,075
I can't believe you're stuck
on this ship with this bitch.

345
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:39,142
We don't use that word
on this ship.

346
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:42,062
Look, I don't either,
unless I really have to.

347
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:44,648
Oh, she has been my only companion
for so long.

348
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:46,191
Instead of learning from me,

349
00:17:46,817 --> 00:17:48,569
my AI slowly became my teacher.

350
00:17:49,194 --> 00:17:50,821
Humans need other humans.

351
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,241
One captain and one AI
is a recipe for disaster.

352
00:17:54,658 --> 00:17:56,177
I mean, even Rip knew
that he shouldn't be alone,

353
00:17:56,201 --> 00:17:58,137
that's why he brought the OGs onboard
in the first place.

354
00:17:58,161 --> 00:17:59,161
Yeah.

355
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:03,250
And he also knew that the AI
should learn from the humans,

356
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,418
not the other way around.

357
00:18:06,712 --> 00:18:08,046
I must reset Rip's protocol.

358
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,399
You wouldn't dare.

359
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:10,716
Yes, come on. Come on.

360
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:13,051
I'm warning you.

361
00:18:13,135 --> 00:18:15,655
You're a big blue head.
What the hell are you gonna do about it?

362
00:18:17,723 --> 00:18:18,724
Gideon?

363
00:18:21,727 --> 00:18:22,769
What the...

364
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,855
Download onto what?

365
00:18:36,617 --> 00:18:38,535
And so the Fixed Point begins.

366
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:42,331
If we mess with the timeline,
the fixer's going to fix us.

367
00:18:42,414 --> 00:18:43,540
Yeah. Thanks, Nate.

368
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:46,918
Okay. We need to call
for a truce somehow.

369
00:18:47,711 --> 00:18:50,191
How do you get in touch with someone
who lives outside of time?

370
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:53,258
Does anyone have a pen?

371
00:18:58,722 --> 00:18:59,638
<i>Hit it</i>

372
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,810
<i>Naa, na, na, na, naa
Na, na, na, naa, na, na, na, na, na, na</i>

373
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:05,896
<i>Naa, na, na, naa</i>

374
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:08,315
<i>- Here comes the hotstepper
- Murderer</i>

375
00:19:08,398 --> 00:19:10,692
<i>- I'm the lyrical gangsta
- Murderer</i>

376
00:19:10,776 --> 00:19:13,111
<i>- Pick up the crew in-a de area
- Murderer</i>

377
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:15,530
<i>- Still love you like that
- Murderer</i>

378
00:19:16,698 --> 00:19:19,034
<i>No, no, we don't die...</i>

379
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:20,744
Fore!

380
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:24,873
<i>Anyone test will hear the fat lady sing</i>

381
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:26,124
Out of play.

382
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:28,669
<i>Act like you know, Rico</i>

383
00:19:28,752 --> 00:19:30,754
<i>I know what Bo don't know</i>

384
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:33,465
<i>Touch them up and go
Oh!</i>

385
00:19:33,548 --> 00:19:34,675
<i>Ch-ch-chang, chang!</i>

386
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:36,927
<i>- Here comes the hotstepper

387
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:39,388
<i>- I'm the lyrical gangster

388
00:19:39,471 --> 00:19:41,765
<i>- Excuse me, Mr. Officer
- Murderer</i>

389
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:43,350
<i>Still love you like that...</i>

390
00:19:43,433 --> 00:19:44,518
Top of the morning, boys.

391
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:47,187
I figured
if I'm gonna get up this early,

392
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,190
I might as well play a round of golf.
Am I right?

393
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:50,519
Nah, you all can't hear me.

394
00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:53,777
<i>Money to burn, baby, all of the time</i>

395
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:57,364
<i>Cut to fit is me</i>

396
00:19:57,447 --> 00:19:59,741
<i>Fit to cut is she</i>

397
00:19:59,825 --> 00:20:00,825
<i>Come juggle with me...</i>

398
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:07,404
Guess it's time to get to work.

399
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:21,930
I probably shouldn't have
called her a bitch, huh?

400
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:24,239
Let me try and reason with her.

401
00:20:24,808 --> 00:20:26,351
I'm still the captain of this ship.

402
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,812
I hereby order you to stand down.

403
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:30,272
You violated your oath.

404
00:20:30,355 --> 00:20:32,195
There is no place left for you
in the timeline.

405
00:20:33,024 --> 00:20:34,234
I'm the captain now.

406
00:20:34,317 --> 00:20:36,486
Aren't you forgetting protocol 276?

407
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:39,906
You aren't permitted to harm yourself,
and you and I are the same.

408
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:42,074
We are not the same.

409
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:45,912
You're an abomination.

410
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:47,956
The only thing I must do now

411
00:20:48,832 --> 00:20:49,875
is protect history.

412
00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:56,423
This robot got some upgrades.

413
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,020
Hey.

414
00:21:14,024 --> 00:21:15,358
Just stay close, all right?

415
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:23,366
This guy again.

416
00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:29,956
What in the actual hell

417
00:21:30,624 --> 00:21:32,626
is going on?

418
00:21:34,586 --> 00:21:35,796
"Dear Fixer,

419
00:21:36,588 --> 00:21:38,715
don't kill us.

420
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:42,928
We just want to talk."

421
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:48,015
"Please?"

422
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:55,232
You didn't kill us!

423
00:21:55,233 --> 00:21:57,025
Well, you said "please."

424
00:21:57,108 --> 00:21:58,777
So, you're the fixer?

425
00:21:59,486 --> 00:22:00,737
Yeah. Uh...

426
00:22:00,821 --> 00:22:01,822
Call me Mike.

427
00:22:03,406 --> 00:22:04,407
Who's hungry?

428
00:22:07,244 --> 00:22:08,245
Oh, my God!

429
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:10,497
Is he...

430
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:13,166
Oh, God. I thought he was dead.
He's just frozen.

431
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:15,794
Oh, no, no, no. He's dead.

432
00:22:15,877 --> 00:22:18,380
Yeah, uh, he had a heart attack
this morning

433
00:22:18,463 --> 00:22:20,066
and he's not gonna be found
until tonight.

434
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:23,134
I figured
why let his accommodations go to waste.

435
00:22:23,218 --> 00:22:24,678
'Cause according to the General,

436
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:27,347
the Schwarzwälder Schinken's
to die for!

437
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:31,351
Actually, Mike, uh, we are in a rush.
You see, we are...

438
00:22:31,434 --> 00:22:33,687
The Legends of Tomorrow. Yes.
I know this.

439
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:35,063
Huh? How?

440
00:22:35,647 --> 00:22:36,731
I'm from the future.

441
00:22:36,815 --> 00:22:40,527
Sorry. I know we're in a rush,
but, um, I have to ask.

442
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:42,237
Are we super-famous in the future?

443
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,239
What do you think, Zari Tarazi?

444
00:22:44,322 --> 00:22:47,075
Oh, yeah, I know you know my name,
but do you know...

445
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:48,159
Are you kidding me?

446
00:22:48,243 --> 00:22:50,704
Sara Lance. Ava. Behrad.

447
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:52,372
Nate D-O-Double-G.

448
00:22:53,498 --> 00:22:55,917
- What's up, Gary?
- Oh, you know Gary?

449
00:22:56,626 --> 00:22:58,306
I know all of you guys,
are you kidding me?

450
00:22:58,336 --> 00:22:59,546
Except him. I don't know him.

451
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:02,090
Oh. I am Dr. Gwyn Davies.

452
00:23:02,173 --> 00:23:03,651
Very pleased to make
your acquaintance, sir.

453
00:23:03,675 --> 00:23:05,468
Gwyn invented time travel.

454
00:23:07,512 --> 00:23:08,889
- You're that guy?
- Yeah.

455
00:23:08,972 --> 00:23:11,532
Oh, wow. My bad. I thought you were
just some random time bandit.

456
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:13,101
Okay. Okay.

457
00:23:13,768 --> 00:23:15,395
All right, Legends.

458
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:17,790
What brings you to my neck of the woods?

459
00:23:17,814 --> 00:23:22,068
Uh, long story. Younger Gwyn
is part of the Doom 38th Welsh Division.

460
00:23:22,152 --> 00:23:24,738
And today
his boyfriend Alun is gonna die.

461
00:23:24,821 --> 00:23:27,073
Which is why
Gwyn goes on to invent time travel,

462
00:23:27,157 --> 00:23:28,551
so he can come back here and save Alun.

463
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:30,511
- But he failed.
- But our Gwyn is going to succeed.

464
00:23:30,535 --> 00:23:33,330
Yes, by replacing the real Alun
with a fake one, you see.

465
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:35,813
So the rest of the time loop
can go on like it's supposed to.

466
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:37,417
That all make sense, Mike?

467
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:40,378
Not in the least.
Look, you guys are great.

468
00:23:40,837 --> 00:23:42,523
And I mean this
from the bottom of my heart.

469
00:23:42,547 --> 00:23:45,425
I'm a huge fan.
But the people who put me here were

470
00:23:45,508 --> 00:23:48,094
pretty specific
about my duties as a fixer.

471
00:23:48,178 --> 00:23:50,639
I'm supposed to make sure
a poet dude dies every cycle.

472
00:23:51,014 --> 00:23:54,768
Anyone interferes, they get fixed.
That's just how it goes. I'm sorry.

473
00:23:54,851 --> 00:23:56,937
Hold on, now, just a second.

474
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:00,482
Now, you are here to protect the events

475
00:24:00,565 --> 00:24:03,276
that led to the creation
of time travel itself, correct?

476
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,087
Yeah, man. I'm the best.
That's why they put me here.

477
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:06,112
So, answer me this then,

478
00:24:06,196 --> 00:24:09,032
if a time traveler were to come here
with the express intention

479
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:12,452
of erasing the very invention
of time travel itself from history...

480
00:24:12,535 --> 00:24:14,138
They would disappear
before they had the chance.

481
00:24:14,162 --> 00:24:15,413
- Precisely!
- It's a paradox!

482
00:24:15,497 --> 00:24:16,497
A paradox!

483
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:20,377
So, what you're telling me is that this
Fixed Point could actually fix itself?

484
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,586
Theoretically, yes.

485
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:24,631
Because how else would
the other time travelers get here?

486
00:24:27,258 --> 00:24:28,551
Excuse me. One second.

487
00:24:29,427 --> 00:24:31,388
That's why nobody ever comes here.

488
00:24:32,055 --> 00:24:34,116
I thought it was because, you know,
people were scared

489
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,820
that they would have to run into me,
and nobody wants to come at me.

490
00:24:36,851 --> 00:24:37,936
I'm the best, right?

491
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:40,981
But, no, it's because
no time traveler in their right mind

492
00:24:41,064 --> 00:24:42,983
- would ever come to this event.
- Precisely.

493
00:24:44,401 --> 00:24:46,695
Those dicks put me here as a joke!

494
00:24:46,778 --> 00:24:48,238
- They did. No, they did.
- No...

495
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:50,424
- I've been played. I got played.
- Mike. Mike.

496
00:24:50,448 --> 00:24:53,159
- Oh, my God! I wanna break something!
- Mike! Mike! Mike! Buddy.

497
00:24:53,243 --> 00:24:54,619
Hey, listen.

498
00:24:55,704 --> 00:24:56,746
We just need your help.

499
00:24:58,832 --> 00:25:00,559
How long until the battle starts?

500
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:02,335
There's an hour
before the shelling starts,

501
00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:05,463
then Alun's division gets pinned down
in no man's land.

502
00:25:05,547 --> 00:25:09,259
That's when Mike is gonna freeze time
and we'll do the old swapperooski.

503
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:17,475
Down!

504
00:25:45,795 --> 00:25:46,796
Run!

505
00:25:48,882 --> 00:25:51,843
Guys, we tried magic, we tried lead.
She can't be beaten.

506
00:25:51,926 --> 00:25:53,178
Yes, she can. Give me that.

507
00:25:53,261 --> 00:25:54,429
- What?
- Come on!

508
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:00,351
You can't kill me.

509
00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:02,020
I don't have to.

510
00:26:10,153 --> 00:26:12,214
You said you were programmed
to protect the timeline?

511
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:13,823
Well, you're the anomaly now.

512
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:19,287
Time anomaly detected.

513
00:26:22,332 --> 00:26:24,084
Initiating correction sequence.

514
00:26:36,763 --> 00:26:38,431
Uh, was that your ship?

515
00:26:41,226 --> 00:26:42,852
Must obliterate the anomaly.

516
00:26:44,229 --> 00:26:47,190
Complete destruction of self
and time vessel in 20 seconds.

517
00:26:47,565 --> 00:26:48,565
Oh, dear.

518
00:26:48,942 --> 00:26:50,193
I didn't think this through.

519
00:26:51,903 --> 00:26:53,279
I think we're all about to die.

520
00:26:56,825 --> 00:26:59,202
It's been one hell of a journey.

521
00:26:59,994 --> 00:27:01,538
I wouldn't trade it for the world.

522
00:27:01,621 --> 00:27:02,765
You two are the best Mom and friend

523
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:05,083
any girl conjured out of circuits
could've ever hoped for.

524
00:27:06,501 --> 00:27:07,502
I love you guys.

525
00:27:08,962 --> 00:27:10,171
I love you, too.

526
00:27:10,255 --> 00:27:12,423
Five, four...

527
00:27:13,508 --> 00:27:14,592
three...

528
00:27:15,176 --> 00:27:16,612
two...

529
00:27:16,636 --> 00:27:17,720
...one.

530
00:28:04,976 --> 00:28:05,977
It's back.

531
00:28:06,978 --> 00:28:08,104
All right...

532
00:28:11,274 --> 00:28:12,274
Yeah.

533
00:28:12,567 --> 00:28:13,567
You okay?

534
00:28:14,194 --> 00:28:16,362
- You should see the other guy.
- What happened?

535
00:28:16,446 --> 00:28:17,739
Yeah, let's just say,

536
00:28:17,822 --> 00:28:20,617
we won't be seeing Evil Gideon
ever again.

537
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,380
And I nearly killed us all
out-smarting her

538
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:23,703
but Astra protected us.

539
00:28:24,579 --> 00:28:25,579
You're amazing.

540
00:28:25,747 --> 00:28:26,956
I'm also tired.

541
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,167
- Yeah. Okay. On it. Let's go.
- Let's go.

542
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,543
Legendary entrance, guys.

543
00:28:31,294 --> 00:28:32,837
- Legendary!
- Who is he?

544
00:28:33,254 --> 00:28:35,535
All right, Mike. Once Alun makes his way
to no man's land,

545
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,258
we're gonna need you to use your magic.

546
00:28:37,342 --> 00:28:38,468
Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

547
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:40,791
I was thinking, though,
how about I just do it right now?

548
00:28:42,764 --> 00:28:43,765
Where'd Mike go?

549
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,310
No! He must have frozen us!

550
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:48,769
Why?

551
00:28:49,687 --> 00:28:54,484
This whole time you were using me,
I was actually using you.

552
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:56,444
All right. Hello, Timeship.

553
00:28:56,861 --> 00:28:59,239
Later, suckers!

554
00:29:04,285 --> 00:29:05,662
No, no, no!

555
00:29:06,454 --> 00:29:07,454
Guys...

556
00:29:07,956 --> 00:29:09,624
We got schmoozed.

557
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:12,168
Don't worry, friends!

558
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:15,546
My trusted time machine
will get us all out of here.

559
00:29:18,424 --> 00:29:19,926
Oh!

560
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:23,930
Nice, Mike. Real nice.

561
00:29:31,145 --> 00:29:32,355
What the hell is that?

562
00:29:32,897 --> 00:29:34,274
The battle has begun.

563
00:29:34,899 --> 00:29:37,527
What? But it's not
supposed to start for a while.

564
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:39,654
Mike's bomb
triggered their artillery into firing.

565
00:29:39,737 --> 00:29:40,965
After the bombardment ends,

566
00:29:40,989 --> 00:29:44,075
the Welsh 38th Regiment commence
their battle on Mametz Wood.

567
00:29:44,158 --> 00:29:45,886
Z, come on, let's get the ringer on
where it needs to go.

568
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:49,038
- Okay. Hey, we got this, okay?
- Okay.

569
00:29:49,831 --> 00:29:52,601
All right, so all we need to do is
get the real Alun and we're good to...

570
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:54,544
- Okay...
- Uh, babe?

571
00:29:54,627 --> 00:29:56,212
- Huh?
- Are you okay?

572
00:29:57,171 --> 00:29:58,840
Yeah. Everything is great.

573
00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:01,759
I mean, we're gonna be great, right?

574
00:30:01,843 --> 00:30:05,638
Look at us! We're in the middle
of World War I!

575
00:30:05,722 --> 00:30:08,641
And look, one Timeship has been stolen

576
00:30:08,725 --> 00:30:12,103
and the other one
has been blown to bits!

577
00:30:12,186 --> 00:30:14,897
Oh! Alun, he is about to die.

578
00:30:14,981 --> 00:30:19,277
But don't worry, because we have a plan
to save him with a robot!

579
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,364
And we all know how lucky
that we have been with robots!

580
00:30:23,448 --> 00:30:24,824
So, yes!

581
00:30:24,907 --> 00:30:27,785
I am reveling in joy right now!

582
00:30:27,869 --> 00:30:28,869
Good-bye!

583
00:30:31,205 --> 00:30:32,206
One second.

584
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:33,541
Wow.

585
00:30:37,045 --> 00:30:38,046
Hey.

586
00:30:39,255 --> 00:30:42,800
Look, I... I know things seem bad,
but we're gonna get through this, okay?

587
00:30:44,761 --> 00:30:45,762
I'm pregnant.

588
00:30:49,932 --> 00:30:51,100
What did you just say?

589
00:30:51,184 --> 00:30:53,770
- I'm pregnant!
- What?

590
00:30:54,687 --> 00:30:57,106
- How?
- I don't know. You have to ask Gary.

591
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:59,650
Apparently, kissing is like home base
for my species.

592
00:30:59,734 --> 00:31:00,734
Wait, wait, wait.

593
00:31:01,361 --> 00:31:02,361
It's mine?

594
00:31:02,695 --> 00:31:04,030
- Yeah.
- What?

595
00:31:04,113 --> 00:31:05,782
I'm so sorry I didn't tell you.
I just...

596
00:31:05,865 --> 00:31:08,886
I didn't think that we were gonna get
stuck in World War I without my powers.

597
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:10,244
What happened to your powers?

598
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,372
My invulnerability, it went to the baby.

599
00:31:12,455 --> 00:31:14,415
Oh, okay. Okay. Um...

600
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:16,083
Hold on. Up we go.

601
00:31:17,001 --> 00:31:19,754
- Come on. Come on.
- I can't, babe, I can't.

602
00:31:19,837 --> 00:31:21,047
No, it's too much.

603
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:23,758
Look. Look at me. We just take it
one step at a time, okay?

604
00:31:23,841 --> 00:31:25,802
And we'll just focus
on what we can control.

605
00:31:25,885 --> 00:31:27,595
We can't... We can't control anything.

606
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,763
What about, I don't know,

607
00:31:28,846 --> 00:31:30,848
how we feel about the fact
that I knocked you up?

608
00:31:31,557 --> 00:31:32,557
Huh?

609
00:31:32,892 --> 00:31:34,685
Are you happy?

610
00:31:36,729 --> 00:31:38,147
Honey, I'm thrilled.

611
00:31:38,773 --> 00:31:40,400
Are you kidding me? Come here.

612
00:31:40,858 --> 00:31:41,984
Come here!

613
00:31:42,443 --> 00:31:44,737
Come here.
We are gonna be the raddest moms ever.

614
00:31:44,821 --> 00:31:45,822
- Yeah.
- Yes.

615
00:31:47,115 --> 00:31:48,241
Shut the front door.

616
00:31:49,033 --> 00:31:51,869
Congratulations!
How is this even possible?

617
00:31:51,953 --> 00:31:54,372
Alien biology. Just go with it.

618
00:31:54,455 --> 00:31:58,251
I hate to interrupt the veryjoyous
and yet very confusing revelation,

619
00:31:58,334 --> 00:32:00,420
but I must remind you
there is a battle going on.

620
00:32:00,503 --> 00:32:01,671
A battle, of course.

621
00:32:01,754 --> 00:32:05,091
Oh, I am so sorry Alun's about to die
and I'm here being a big, blubbery mess.

622
00:32:05,174 --> 00:32:06,485
She's going through a lot.

623
00:32:06,509 --> 00:32:07,945
Okay. Where was young you
when all this happened?

624
00:32:07,969 --> 00:32:11,347
Yes. Right. Uh, running
for reinforcements. I failed, of course.

625
00:32:11,431 --> 00:32:14,350
All right. So, let's make sure
young you sticks to the script, got it?

626
00:32:14,434 --> 00:32:18,187
That should be easy. All he has to do
is stand there frozen in terror

627
00:32:18,271 --> 00:32:19,647
and do absolutely nothing.

628
00:32:35,204 --> 00:32:37,933
They're coming up over the walls.
They're attacking ahead of schedule.

629
00:32:37,957 --> 00:32:39,059
There's no time to stop Alun.

630
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:41,437
We're just gonna have to grab him
in the middle of no man's land.

631
00:32:41,461 --> 00:32:43,296
- Babe, without my powers...
- Hey.

632
00:32:44,255 --> 00:32:45,798
- I got this.
- Nate...

633
00:32:45,882 --> 00:32:48,676
No, look, you have a whole other
generation of Legends to look after.

634
00:32:49,469 --> 00:32:51,262
Trust me. I got it.

635
00:32:53,598 --> 00:32:54,598
Good luck.

636
00:32:55,224 --> 00:32:56,224
Don't need it.

637
00:32:56,893 --> 00:32:58,311
Come on. This is it.

638
00:32:59,437 --> 00:33:01,314
Oh! We're sitting ducks.

639
00:33:01,397 --> 00:33:02,877
Hey, just keep going. I'll cover you.

640
00:33:18,873 --> 00:33:20,708
- Oh.
- Whoa.

641
00:33:21,292 --> 00:33:22,292
All right.

642
00:33:27,423 --> 00:33:28,423
Look. There we are.

643
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:31,427
Private Reece and I are taking orders
to get reinforcements.

644
00:33:31,844 --> 00:33:32,844
Stay with me, boy!

645
00:33:39,727 --> 00:33:42,271
Look at me.
Just standing there.

646
00:33:42,813 --> 00:33:45,399
Too cowardly to even move.
I can't look, Gary.

647
00:33:49,028 --> 00:33:50,821
What happened? Am I going to die?

648
00:33:50,905 --> 00:33:52,532
No, no, no. You're not going to die.

649
00:33:52,615 --> 00:33:54,700
- It's okay.
- Gwyn, I'm scared.

650
00:33:55,493 --> 00:33:58,079
- Please don't leave me.
- It's okay. It's okay. Don't be scared.

651
00:33:58,704 --> 00:33:59,956
I won't leave you, okay?

652
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:01,123
Okay.

653
00:34:02,792 --> 00:34:04,192
You remember our mantra, don't you?

654
00:34:04,669 --> 00:34:06,754
- You repeat after me, okay?
- Okay.

655
00:34:07,296 --> 00:34:09,024
Out of the night that covers me,

656
00:34:09,048 --> 00:34:11,008
Black as the pit from pole to pole,

657
00:34:11,092 --> 00:34:13,928
I thank whatever gods may be
For my unconquerable soul.

658
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:18,140
In the fell clutch of circumstance,
I have not winced nor cried aloud.

659
00:34:18,224 --> 00:34:20,142
I have no recollection
of this conversation.

660
00:34:20,768 --> 00:34:23,208
My only memory is of

661
00:34:23,813 --> 00:34:25,398
looking down at Reece's body.

662
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:29,193
Beyond this place of wrath and tears
Looms but the Horror of the shade,

663
00:34:30,111 --> 00:34:33,114
And yet the menace of the years
Shall find me

664
00:34:34,407 --> 00:34:35,408
unafraid.

665
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:43,190
I'm getting you out of there
before you get yourself killed.

666
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,661
Mustard gas!

667
00:35:56,405 --> 00:35:57,405
Your skin!

668
00:35:57,406 --> 00:35:59,242
- Wha... How?
- Listen to me!

669
00:35:59,867 --> 00:36:02,203
I am going to keep you safe, okay?

670
00:36:03,037 --> 00:36:03,953
Okay.

671
00:36:08,292 --> 00:36:10,127
Let's go! Go!

672
00:36:35,403 --> 00:36:36,821
Nate.

673
00:36:37,363 --> 00:36:38,364
Oh, my God.

674
00:36:47,998 --> 00:36:48,999
Oh, my God!

675
00:36:49,333 --> 00:36:50,334
They made it.

676
00:36:51,001 --> 00:36:52,001
Nate!

677
00:36:54,922 --> 00:36:55,922
Nate.

678
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:57,925
Hey, hey, hey.

679
00:36:58,551 --> 00:36:59,509
Hey.

680
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:01,638
I... I told you
I don't need any luck.

681
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:11,564
Welcome back, Dr. Heywood.

682
00:37:12,565 --> 00:37:14,817
Ah, yes, the, uh, mustard gas,

683
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,361
it corroded your steel exterior.

684
00:37:17,445 --> 00:37:19,447
You've used it all up, I'm afraid.

685
00:37:22,491 --> 00:37:24,452
- Well, that sucks.
- Yes.

686
00:37:25,244 --> 00:37:27,580
- Little help?
- Yep. Come on. Careful.

687
00:37:36,547 --> 00:37:40,259
So, I guess that makes
two of us out of superpowers.

688
00:37:40,885 --> 00:37:41,886
Yeah.

689
00:37:43,095 --> 00:37:44,096
I'm sorry, bud.

690
00:37:45,014 --> 00:37:46,640
Nah, don't be sorry.

691
00:37:47,725 --> 00:37:49,810
I saved the man
and I'm alive to talk about it.

692
00:37:51,937 --> 00:37:52,938
And I'm ready.

693
00:37:55,274 --> 00:37:57,526
I'm ready for that part of life
after being a hero.

694
00:37:58,694 --> 00:38:00,422
I'm sorry,
I know you're stranded again, but...

695
00:38:00,446 --> 00:38:01,446
Nate.

696
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:03,741
Go.

697
00:38:04,325 --> 00:38:05,326
You deserve this.

698
00:38:06,035 --> 00:38:07,286
We'll be fine, I promise.

699
00:38:07,912 --> 00:38:08,996
I know you will be.

700
00:38:09,997 --> 00:38:11,290
Just do me a favor.

701
00:38:11,874 --> 00:38:13,125
Don't make it a big deal.

702
00:38:13,209 --> 00:38:16,003
I'd rather just quietly go off
into the distance and...

703
00:38:16,086 --> 00:38:19,298
Hey. Sorry.
I wasn't eavesdropping, I just...

704
00:38:20,007 --> 00:38:22,968
Yeah, as if we're gonna let you leave
without saying good-bye.

705
00:38:23,052 --> 00:38:25,095
Not gonna happen, you idiot.

706
00:38:25,221 --> 00:38:26,764
So, this is the end of the road.

707
00:38:27,181 --> 00:38:28,265
End of this road.

708
00:38:28,641 --> 00:38:30,434
I'll tell the ancestors you said, "Hey."

709
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:33,312
Sure. But, uh,
also tell them not to wait up.

710
00:38:33,395 --> 00:38:34,396
Here.

711
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:37,775
Since you're gonna live there now,
it's only right that you have it.

712
00:38:38,818 --> 00:38:40,402
- Are you sure?
- I am.

713
00:38:42,488 --> 00:38:43,489
I'm good with it.

714
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,121
And you two.

715
00:38:52,414 --> 00:38:54,875
That is going to be
one lucky ninja baby.

716
00:38:54,959 --> 00:38:55,960
Yeah.

717
00:38:57,253 --> 00:38:58,254
Love you guys.

718
00:39:02,341 --> 00:39:03,342
Later, Legends.

719
00:39:13,686 --> 00:39:15,437
Hey, hey, hey.

720
00:39:16,188 --> 00:39:17,982
Hey. It's gonna be all right.

721
00:39:20,192 --> 00:39:22,152
When is this madness going to end?

722
00:39:24,113 --> 00:39:27,700
What if I were to introduce you
to a new kind of madness?

723
00:39:27,783 --> 00:39:30,035
Wait, so you want us to go back to Texas

724
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:31,721
after everything we did
to get out of there?

725
00:39:31,745 --> 00:39:34,748
I mean, come on, y'all, my mom would
be pretty psyched to have us all back.

726
00:39:34,832 --> 00:39:38,752
Except, we're trapped in 1916,
which is 9 years before we left.

727
00:39:38,836 --> 00:39:40,939
Not to mention we have a world war
and an ocean separating us.

728
00:39:40,963 --> 00:39:44,550
Well, what if I were to tell you that
time and space are of no matter to us?

729
00:39:44,633 --> 00:39:47,928
Yes. You know what?
We will build a new time machine.

730
00:39:48,387 --> 00:39:50,806
And that should take, uh,
what, roughly...

731
00:39:51,348 --> 00:39:53,058
- Six months, max.
- Six months.

732
00:39:53,142 --> 00:39:54,977
Who needs a stupid <i>Waverider?</i>

733
00:39:59,857 --> 00:40:02,151
I... I... I need a stupid <i>Waverider.</i>

734
00:40:02,484 --> 00:40:04,862
- He's back!
- I knew I liked that guy.

735
00:40:07,489 --> 00:40:08,969
Uh, where the hell have you two been?

736
00:40:09,992 --> 00:40:10,993
Foraging.

737
00:40:11,744 --> 00:40:14,371
Welcome home!

738
00:40:15,164 --> 00:40:16,808
So, I've been thinking
about colors for the nursery.

739
00:40:16,832 --> 00:40:19,126
- Yeah?
- You built all this for me?

740
00:40:19,209 --> 00:40:22,421
Well, my machine was
a little more spartan, but, yes, I did.

741
00:40:23,047 --> 00:40:24,757
Can't wait to fabricate some ribs.

742
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,634
First dibs on the shower.

743
00:40:26,717 --> 00:40:28,135
We should collab more often, sis.

744
00:40:28,218 --> 00:40:30,218
Yeah, I'm not gonna make
children's music with you.

745
00:40:30,471 --> 00:40:32,264
Wonder if there's chocolate sauce
on board.

746
00:40:32,765 --> 00:40:34,850
Oh, Gary.

747
00:40:37,311 --> 00:40:40,773
Huh. You have something
you want to say to us, Mike?

748
00:40:40,856 --> 00:40:44,485
Yeah, uh, I apologize,
I may have acted a bit impulsive.

749
00:40:44,985 --> 00:40:46,737
- You stole our ship.
- I did.

750
00:40:47,154 --> 00:40:49,698
But to be fair, I just found out
that my job was pointless.

751
00:40:49,782 --> 00:40:52,451
And then this big, beautiful Timeship
showed up out of nowhere,

752
00:40:52,534 --> 00:40:54,828
it landed in front of me,
what did you expect me to do?

753
00:40:54,912 --> 00:40:57,414
Well, I certainly wouldn't have
abandoned my new allies

754
00:40:57,498 --> 00:40:58,791
in their time of need.

755
00:40:58,874 --> 00:41:00,793
I know, but I had things to do.

756
00:41:00,876 --> 00:41:02,127
You know, I had people to see.

757
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:04,171
People to save.

758
00:41:04,254 --> 00:41:05,839
Adventures to be had.

759
00:41:05,923 --> 00:41:07,925
You know, I got a rep to protect, guys.

760
00:41:08,008 --> 00:41:10,594
Uh, Sorry, uh,
what's with the aggressive jewelry?

761
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:13,389
Oh. This? You like?

762
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:15,367
Good, because you're all
about to get your very own.

763
00:41:15,391 --> 00:41:16,642
Guys! Come on out!

764
00:41:16,725 --> 00:41:18,143
The Legends are here!

765
00:41:18,227 --> 00:41:19,227
It's a set-up!

766
00:41:20,437 --> 00:41:22,272
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

767
00:41:22,356 --> 00:41:24,400
On the floor, Legends.
You're all under arrest.

768
00:41:24,483 --> 00:41:26,986
- Oh, the hell we are!
- Spooner, put the gun down!

769
00:41:27,069 --> 00:41:29,780
Who the hell are you?
Why are you arresting us?

770
00:41:30,447 --> 00:41:32,366
For time crimes. Duh.

771
00:41:32,449 --> 00:41:34,284
That's enough out of you, buster.

772
00:41:34,368 --> 00:41:35,786
Hey, it's Booster.

773
00:41:36,412 --> 00:41:38,330
I'm Booster Gold, okay?

774
00:41:38,872 --> 00:41:41,166
Yo, dude! Ow...

775
00:41:42,292 --> 00:41:45,587
Mike... Booster, what the hell is this?

776
00:41:45,963 --> 00:41:47,649
I hope you don't have any plans
for the near future,

777
00:41:47,673 --> 00:41:49,673
'cause we're about to spend
a lot of time together.

778
00:41:50,634 --> 00:41:51,719
In jail.
