<i>OSWALD: There's a war coming,</i>

2
00:00:02,191 --> 00:00:03,658
<i>a terrible war.</i>

3
00:00:03,692 --> 00:00:05,293
<i>There will be chaos,</i>

4
00:00:05,327 --> 00:00:06,844
rivers of blood in the streets,

5
00:00:06,875 --> 00:00:09,359
I know it! I-I can see it coming!

6
00:00:09,391 --> 00:00:14,228
It's time. Somebody has to take
over, it might as well be me.

7
00:00:14,262 --> 00:00:15,562
(Bruce screaming)

8
00:00:15,597 --> 00:00:16,997
<i>My name is James Gordon. I'm a detective.</i>

9
00:00:17,031 --> 00:00:18,866
My name is Bruce Wayne.

10
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,667
I promise I will find the man who did this.

11
00:00:20,702 --> 00:00:22,403
Stop, or I'll shoot!

12
00:00:22,437 --> 00:00:23,904
<i>GORDON: He was framed</i>

13
00:00:23,938 --> 00:00:25,372
to cover up for the real killer.

14
00:00:25,407 --> 00:00:29,009
Don't ever come back to Gotham.

15
00:00:29,044 --> 00:00:30,477
<i>MONTOYA: He's killed a man.</i>

16
00:00:30,512 --> 00:00:32,846
And he killed him on the
orders of Carmine Falcone,

17
00:00:32,881 --> 00:00:34,481
biggest crime boss in Gotham.

18
00:00:34,516 --> 00:00:37,751
The death of the Waynes
would bring troubled times

19
00:00:37,786 --> 00:00:39,219
for our family and Gotham.

20
00:00:39,254 --> 00:00:41,321
<i>The Maroni family senses weakness.</i>

21
00:00:42,885 --> 00:00:44,958
Jim, it's for you.

22
00:00:51,332 --> 00:00:52,800
Jim.

23
00:00:54,903 --> 00:00:58,505
Hello, James, old friend.

24
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,264
OSWALD: You must be Barbara.

25
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:05,333
Yes, please come in.

26
00:01:05,367 --> 00:01:07,268
James, hi.

27
00:01:11,429 --> 00:01:12,693
I'm Peter.

28
00:01:12,727 --> 00:01:14,728
Peter... Humboldt.

29
00:01:14,762 --> 00:01:16,830
(laughs) Lovely to meet you at last.

30
00:01:16,865 --> 00:01:18,465
You're even more beautiful than I imagined.

31
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,167
(laughing): Shush.

32
00:01:20,201 --> 00:01:22,136
Nice to meet you, Peter.

33
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:23,771
I never get to meet any of Jim's friends,

34
00:01:23,805 --> 00:01:25,038
'cause he never tells me anything.

35
00:01:25,073 --> 00:01:27,307
- Mm. Men.
- Don't I know.

36
00:01:27,342 --> 00:01:28,942
Would you like a drink?

37
00:01:28,977 --> 00:01:31,545
No, uh... he's a work friend.

38
00:01:31,579 --> 00:01:33,213
It's a work thing.

39
00:01:33,248 --> 00:01:34,681
I'm just recently back in Gotham

40
00:01:34,716 --> 00:01:38,752
and I had an idea to
pop by out of the blue.

41
00:01:38,787 --> 00:01:40,621
But now is clearly not a good time.

42
00:01:40,655 --> 00:01:43,357
I'll walk you out.

43
00:01:43,391 --> 00:01:45,359
I told you never to come back here!

44
00:01:45,393 --> 00:01:47,628
I know. I know. I-I apologize.

45
00:01:47,662 --> 00:01:50,431
- But I-I just wanted to speak with you.
- No!

46
00:01:50,465 --> 00:01:53,267
If Falcone finds out you're
alive, he'll kill us both.

47
00:01:53,301 --> 00:01:54,935
I got no place else to go.

48
00:01:54,969 --> 00:01:57,271
(stammering) Gotham is my home.

49
00:01:57,305 --> 00:01:58,939
I should've killed you.

50
00:01:58,973 --> 00:02:01,675
I should put a bullet
in your head right now.

51
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:04,645
And you would have every right to do so.

52
00:02:04,679 --> 00:02:06,980
But you won't, Jim Gordon,
because you're a good man.

53
00:02:07,015 --> 00:02:09,283
You may very well be the
last good man in Gotham,

54
00:02:09,317 --> 00:02:10,918
and that's why I want to help you.

55
00:02:10,952 --> 00:02:13,921
- I don't want your help.
- No, no, but you need it.

56
00:02:13,955 --> 00:02:17,791
That vile creature Fish Mooney,
Don Falcone, the police...

57
00:02:17,826 --> 00:02:19,860
not even your own partner trusts you.

58
00:02:19,894 --> 00:02:21,862
They will always hide the truth from you!

59
00:02:21,896 --> 00:02:24,798
But not me. Never.

60
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:25,933
(chuckles)

61
00:02:25,967 --> 00:02:29,036
- You saved my life.
- God knows I wish I hadn't.

62
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:31,939
(anxious panting)

63
00:02:31,973 --> 00:02:33,885
Kill me now or trust me!

64
00:02:38,413 --> 00:02:40,414
(glass shatters) (gasping)

65
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,185
I told you there's a war coming, Jim.

66
00:02:46,951 --> 00:02:50,424
There will be so many deaths. So many.

67
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:52,559
You want to save Gotham? I can help you.

68
00:02:52,594 --> 00:02:54,328
I can be your secret agent.

69
00:02:54,362 --> 00:02:56,430
Until Falcone finds out you're alive.

70
00:02:56,464 --> 00:02:58,465
Nobody looks for a dead man.

71
00:03:00,702 --> 00:03:02,136
This war...

72
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:04,972
what are you talking about?
Why will there be a war?

73
00:03:05,006 --> 00:03:07,341
Well, as you know, war is just politics

74
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:09,443
by other means.

75
00:03:09,477 --> 00:03:11,845
And isn't politics just money, talking?

76
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,380
Talking about what?

77
00:03:13,415 --> 00:03:15,649
(chuckles)

78
00:03:15,684 --> 00:03:17,685
Arkham. Of course.

79
00:03:19,387 --> 00:03:20,888
(women whooping)

80
00:03:20,922 --> 00:03:22,256
(laughing)

81
00:03:33,535 --> 00:03:35,836
(door creaks open, then shuts)

82
00:03:38,206 --> 00:03:41,709
- Ready for some prime rib tonight?
- I am, sir.

83
00:03:41,743 --> 00:03:43,277
Excuse me.

84
00:03:43,311 --> 00:03:45,946
Councilman Jenkins?

85
00:03:45,981 --> 00:03:48,182
- Can I help you?
- Yes, uh,

86
00:03:48,216 --> 00:03:50,784
I'm one of your constituents.

87
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:52,720
Voted for you every time.

88
00:03:52,754 --> 00:03:54,388
Well, thank you very much, my friend.

89
00:03:54,422 --> 00:03:55,489
I don't want to...

90
00:03:55,523 --> 00:03:57,157
take up too much of your valuable time.

91
00:03:57,192 --> 00:03:58,926
I just want to show you something.

92
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,594
Well, I'm always happy
to help constituents,

93
00:04:00,628 --> 00:04:02,663
but perhaps you can come by my office.

94
00:04:02,697 --> 00:04:05,032
Sir, please, just one second.

95
00:04:05,066 --> 00:04:07,935
Now...

96
00:04:07,969 --> 00:04:09,937
I got the idea for this...

97
00:04:09,971 --> 00:04:11,338
years ago.

98
00:04:13,775 --> 00:04:15,576
Designed and built it myself.

99
00:04:18,346 --> 00:04:21,348
Here. Take a look.

100
00:04:21,383 --> 00:04:23,217
Go ahead. You...

101
00:04:23,251 --> 00:04:25,486
just put your eye in the end there.

102
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,521
That's it.

103
00:04:27,555 --> 00:04:29,490
- What is that thing?
- You'll see.

104
00:04:29,524 --> 00:04:31,325
(grunts)

105
00:04:34,729 --> 00:04:37,398
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- You're next.

106
00:04:37,432 --> 00:04:39,600
(shouting)

107
00:04:41,903 --> 00:04:43,904
(grunting)

108
00:04:54,549 --> 00:04:56,250
(frantically pressing buttons)

109
00:05:00,288 --> 00:05:02,089
(screams weakly)

110
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:06,527
Honestly, sir,

111
00:05:06,561 --> 00:05:07,995
I really did vote for you.

112
00:05:08,029 --> 00:05:09,463
(blade clicks)

113
00:05:21,856 --> 00:05:23,991
Hey, I'm working.

114
00:05:24,025 --> 00:05:26,460
Caught a double homicide. You're up.

115
00:05:26,494 --> 00:05:29,730
Uh, no way. Alvarez hasn't done
a case all week. It's his turn.

116
00:05:29,764 --> 00:05:31,832
ESSEN: Alvarez put in
double overtime last week.

117
00:05:31,866 --> 00:05:33,901
- Hey, Gordon.
- Captain.

118
00:05:33,935 --> 00:05:35,736
Councilman Ron Jenkins

119
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,471
and his aide were found
dead in a parking structure

120
00:05:37,505 --> 00:05:39,006
this morning. Still waiting

121
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,341
on the M.E.'s report,

122
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:42,476
but their wallets and jewelry were missing.

123
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,545
A councilman. Maybe it's a political hit.

124
00:05:44,579 --> 00:05:46,480
Nah, no one hits councilmen.
It's cheaper to bribe 'em.

125
00:05:46,514 --> 00:05:48,282
You kill 'em and another bum

126
00:05:48,316 --> 00:05:50,451
with his hand out just takes his place.

127
00:05:50,485 --> 00:05:52,586
ESSEN: Sniff around city hall if you want.

128
00:05:52,621 --> 00:05:54,822
Smart money says this was
just wrong place, wrong time.

129
00:05:54,856 --> 00:05:57,157
Go work it.

130
00:05:57,192 --> 00:05:59,693
(groans) Slave driver.

131
00:05:59,728 --> 00:06:01,595
Don't worry, Jim.

132
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:04,732
I know just where to start.

133
00:06:04,766 --> 00:06:09,036
<i>♪ All at sea again ♪</i>

134
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:13,741
<i>♪ And now my hurricanes ♪</i>

135
00:06:13,775 --> 00:06:16,744
<i>♪ Have brought down this ocean rain ♪</i>

136
00:06:16,778 --> 00:06:19,647
- You got talent.
- Hmm.

137
00:06:19,681 --> 00:06:21,115
She's not bad-looking.

138
00:06:21,149 --> 00:06:22,616
That's plenty.

139
00:06:22,651 --> 00:06:26,153
Come to me so I can take you in.

140
00:06:26,187 --> 00:06:28,856
You sing well.

141
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:31,859
For this job, I need more
than a pair of nice pipes

142
00:06:31,893 --> 00:06:33,327
and a pretty face.

143
00:06:33,361 --> 00:06:34,895
I'll do whatever it takes.

144
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:37,831
I like hearing that. So...

145
00:06:37,866 --> 00:06:40,501
you like boys or girls?

146
00:06:40,535 --> 00:06:43,070
Boys.

147
00:06:43,104 --> 00:06:45,072
Fine.

148
00:06:45,106 --> 00:06:47,007
Pretend I'm a boy.

149
00:06:47,042 --> 00:06:49,076
Seduce me.

150
00:07:00,388 --> 00:07:02,723
(moans softly)

151
00:07:05,126 --> 00:07:07,795
Least you can sing.

152
00:07:07,829 --> 00:07:10,598
Butch? Put a pin in this one.

153
00:07:10,632 --> 00:07:12,633
We'll call you.

154
00:07:14,436 --> 00:07:16,570
Not bad but keep looking.

155
00:07:16,605 --> 00:07:19,106
Really, boss? That's a good-looking girl.

156
00:07:20,508 --> 00:07:22,843
Look at me.

157
00:07:22,877 --> 00:07:25,512
I ain't looking for no girl.

158
00:07:25,547 --> 00:07:29,550
I'm looking for a weapon.

159
00:07:29,584 --> 00:07:31,885
Come on, Nicky, don't be modest.

160
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,355
You're the crown prince
of parking lot muggers.

161
00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:35,956
No one's got a bigger rep.

162
00:07:35,991 --> 00:07:37,424
I'm on sabbatical.

163
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:39,126
I didn't kill no one. That's not my thing.

164
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,128
Then why'd you have a
shank in your backpack?

165
00:07:41,162 --> 00:07:42,930
Protection.

166
00:07:42,964 --> 00:07:45,299
BULLOCK: Councilman Jenkins was murdered.

167
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:46,767
We know it was you.

168
00:07:46,801 --> 00:07:49,303
- We got witnesses.
- I swear to God I didn't do it!

169
00:07:50,972 --> 00:07:52,740
Hey. Hey!

170
00:07:52,774 --> 00:07:55,142
He's not our guy, Harvey.

171
00:08:03,485 --> 00:08:04,852
- Alvarez.
- Yo.

172
00:08:04,886 --> 00:08:06,053
What's this?

173
00:08:06,087 --> 00:08:07,721
Evidence from your crime scene.

174
00:08:07,756 --> 00:08:09,957
Couple of unis just dropped it off.

175
00:08:19,534 --> 00:08:22,169
Arkham.

176
00:08:22,203 --> 00:08:25,172
MAYOR AUBREY JAMES: 40
acres, 26 city blocks.

177
00:08:25,206 --> 00:08:27,808
The last major undeveloped district

178
00:08:27,842 --> 00:08:30,878
in the city of Gotham, Arkham.

179
00:08:30,912 --> 00:08:33,881
Now, before their
untimely and tragic deaths,

180
00:08:33,915 --> 00:08:37,351
Thomas and Martha Wayne
had a plan for their city,

181
00:08:37,385 --> 00:08:40,020
a progressive development plan

182
00:08:40,055 --> 00:08:43,357
that would raze Arkham's
shanty towns and, in its place,

183
00:08:43,391 --> 00:08:46,026
build new, affordable housing

184
00:08:46,061 --> 00:08:48,262
for Gotham's less fortunate.

185
00:08:48,296 --> 00:08:49,863
What about the old asylum, Mayor?

186
00:08:49,898 --> 00:08:52,132
Torn down. Brick by brick, if need be.

187
00:08:52,167 --> 00:08:54,468
And in its place, a
cutting-edge, state-of-the-art

188
00:08:54,502 --> 00:08:55,769
mental health facility.

189
00:08:55,804 --> 00:08:59,106
This is a vision for
the future of our city.

190
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,141
An opposing plan is
gaining support recently.

191
00:09:01,176 --> 00:09:04,411
A plan that would do away
with the asylum altogether,

192
00:09:04,446 --> 00:09:07,581
use the surrounding land
as a waste disposal site.

193
00:09:07,615 --> 00:09:09,083
No.

194
00:09:09,117 --> 00:09:11,285
No, the Wayne plan is best for this city

195
00:09:11,319 --> 00:09:14,288
and, more importantly, for
the people of this city.

196
00:09:14,322 --> 00:09:16,490
This is why I am endorsing it.

197
00:09:20,328 --> 00:09:22,129
Don Maroni.

198
00:09:22,163 --> 00:09:23,530
(chuckles) Pleasure to see you.

199
00:09:23,565 --> 00:09:25,966
- Thank you. How are you?
- Please, please, have a seat.

200
00:09:26,001 --> 00:09:27,935
I'll bring wine and bread.

201
00:09:27,969 --> 00:09:30,037
Today is a day of celebration.

202
00:09:30,071 --> 00:09:32,706
A very lucrative deal is coming my way.

203
00:09:32,741 --> 00:09:35,142
Land, my friend.

204
00:09:35,176 --> 00:09:36,143
Land.

205
00:09:36,177 --> 00:09:38,412
That's where the big money is, huh?

206
00:09:47,856 --> 00:09:50,691
I need information about
the Wayne plan for Arkham.

207
00:09:50,725 --> 00:09:55,896
Well, it's the Wayne...
plan in name only now.

208
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:57,798
When the Waynes died,

209
00:09:57,832 --> 00:10:00,801
Falcone stepped in. He's
backing the plan now.

210
00:10:00,835 --> 00:10:05,072
And he stands to make quite a
chunk of change, if it passes.

211
00:10:05,106 --> 00:10:07,708
But Councilman Jenkins
was backing Falcone's plan.

212
00:10:07,742 --> 00:10:08,809
That's right.

213
00:10:10,745 --> 00:10:13,447
- Then he was killed because...
- Because,

214
00:10:13,481 --> 00:10:17,184
Detective, there is an opposing plan.

215
00:10:20,789 --> 00:10:23,424
Maroni.

216
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:27,027
He's the only one strong
enough to oppose Falcone.

217
00:10:27,062 --> 00:10:29,296
He's making a play at Arkham.

218
00:10:29,331 --> 00:10:32,099
BRUCE: Are they related?

219
00:10:32,133 --> 00:10:34,234
GORDON: Bruce.

220
00:10:34,269 --> 00:10:36,136
How are you?

221
00:10:36,171 --> 00:10:39,139
"A new Arkham Asylum will
serve the mentally ill of Gotham

222
00:10:39,174 --> 00:10:41,942
"in ways the present asylum never can.

223
00:10:41,977 --> 00:10:45,479
Those poor, sick souls deserve our help."

224
00:10:45,513 --> 00:10:47,881
My mother wrote that.

225
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:50,150
She and my father fought

226
00:10:50,185 --> 00:10:52,252
for years to get a new asylum built.

227
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:55,389
They thought that if they can
help the city's least fortunate,

228
00:10:55,423 --> 00:10:58,325
it would show there was hope for everyone.

229
00:11:01,229 --> 00:11:02,997
I just don't want my parents' dream

230
00:11:03,031 --> 00:11:04,765
to die with them.

231
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:07,568
I understand that, Bruce.

232
00:11:07,602 --> 00:11:09,937
But this isn't just about the asylum.

233
00:11:09,971 --> 00:11:12,606
If there is a fight
between Falcone and Maroni,

234
00:11:12,641 --> 00:11:13,941
this could be the spark

235
00:11:13,975 --> 00:11:15,643
that ignites a citywide gang war.

236
00:11:17,145 --> 00:11:18,379
Innocents will die,

237
00:11:18,413 --> 00:11:19,680
and whatever little faith

238
00:11:19,714 --> 00:11:21,715
people have that the
police can protect them...

239
00:11:24,219 --> 00:11:26,086
it will be crushed.

240
00:11:26,121 --> 00:11:28,422
So you have to stop it.

241
00:11:32,961 --> 00:11:34,295
(sighs)

242
00:11:34,329 --> 00:11:37,164
(phone buzzing)

243
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,067
This is Gordon.

244
00:11:40,101 --> 00:11:41,602
BULLOCK: Hey, it's me. We got a call.

245
00:11:41,636 --> 00:11:43,437
Councilmen Zeller
has been abducted.

246
00:11:43,471 --> 00:11:46,340
Listen, Gordon, Zeller's
one of Maroni's guys.

247
00:11:46,374 --> 00:11:49,376
Be right there.

248
00:12:15,704 --> 00:12:18,238
(muffled rattling, knocking)

249
00:12:21,409 --> 00:12:23,310
(shouts, gasps)

250
00:12:24,913 --> 00:12:26,246
Please...

251
00:12:26,281 --> 00:12:28,349
don't. I-I'm begging you.

252
00:12:28,383 --> 00:12:30,918
Ah... I... aah...!

253
00:12:32,454 --> 00:12:35,222
(grunting, whimpering)

254
00:12:35,257 --> 00:12:38,726
You know... if it were up to me,

255
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,261
this would be over quick,
without all the fuss.

256
00:12:41,296 --> 00:12:42,896
My father used to say,

257
00:12:42,931 --> 00:12:46,400
"Simplicity is the
ultimate sophistication."

258
00:12:47,535 --> 00:12:48,936
But it's not up to me.

259
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:51,538
And my customer specifically asked me to...

260
00:12:51,573 --> 00:12:54,141
- send a message.
- (whimpering)

261
00:12:54,175 --> 00:12:55,743
And you know what they say:

262
00:12:55,777 --> 00:12:58,245
The customer is always right.

263
00:12:59,281 --> 00:13:01,081
(gasping, grunting)

264
00:13:01,116 --> 00:13:02,516
Please... help!

265
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,618
You-you-you-you... you
don't have to do this!

266
00:13:04,653 --> 00:13:06,754
Help me, somebody! (groans)

267
00:13:08,423 --> 00:13:10,791
Hey! Hey! No, wait.

268
00:13:10,825 --> 00:13:12,393
(sobbing)

269
00:13:12,427 --> 00:13:15,095
Tell Falcone I'll change my vote.

270
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:17,431
Hey-hey, I'll-I'll
back the mayor.

271
00:13:17,465 --> 00:13:20,134
I'll do anything he
wants, but please, please!

272
00:13:20,168 --> 00:13:21,769
Please... No! Please!

273
00:13:21,803 --> 00:13:23,304
Please! Please don't! Aah!

274
00:13:23,338 --> 00:13:24,338
(screaming)

275
00:13:33,765 --> 00:13:36,871
<i>ESSEN: Two councilmen dead in as many days.</i>

276
00:13:36,906 --> 00:13:38,073
Can't be a coincidence.

277
00:13:38,107 --> 00:13:39,674
Got to be politics driving this.

278
00:13:39,709 --> 00:13:41,076
He was right.

279
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:44,212
I never said he was wrong.
I just wanted him to be.

280
00:13:44,246 --> 00:13:47,749
All right, genius, any other insights?

281
00:13:47,783 --> 00:13:49,684
Yeah. This is about the Arkham vote.

282
00:13:49,719 --> 00:13:51,553
- How so?
- Arkham is

283
00:13:51,587 --> 00:13:53,555
more than just a land deal; it's a war

284
00:13:53,589 --> 00:13:55,990
between Falcone and Maroni.

285
00:13:56,025 --> 00:13:58,026
These councilmen were on
opposite sides of that war.

286
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,694
So, who did who?

287
00:13:59,729 --> 00:14:01,696
The way I see it, Maroni struck first.

288
00:14:01,731 --> 00:14:03,231
He had Jenkins

289
00:14:03,265 --> 00:14:04,966
killed to change the vote his way.

290
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,634
Then Falcone retaliated,

291
00:14:06,669 --> 00:14:08,303
had Zeller killed to change the vote back.

292
00:14:08,337 --> 00:14:10,505
Burning the body was Falcone's
way of sending a message.

293
00:14:10,539 --> 00:14:12,006
ESSEN: I'll have guards put

294
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:15,110
on all the other councilmen and
the mayor till this plays out.

295
00:14:16,145 --> 00:14:18,480
So, you want to tell me?

296
00:14:18,514 --> 00:14:21,149
Come on. Falcone, Maroni, Arkham?

297
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:24,119
How the hell do you know
so much all a sudden?

298
00:14:25,821 --> 00:14:28,189
Ed, what you got?

299
00:14:28,224 --> 00:14:31,059
- I have a paradox for you.
- What?

300
00:14:31,093 --> 00:14:33,328
Well, a paradox, Detective,
is when you have...

301
00:14:33,362 --> 00:14:35,163
I know what a paradox is, smartass.

302
00:14:35,197 --> 00:14:36,464
What paradox?

303
00:14:36,499 --> 00:14:38,666
These are the medical examiner's reports

304
00:14:38,701 --> 00:14:41,503
on the murders of Councilman
Jenkins and his aide.

305
00:14:41,537 --> 00:14:44,539
Both victims sustained
fatal puncture wounds

306
00:14:44,573 --> 00:14:46,641
to the skull via the eye socket.

307
00:14:46,675 --> 00:14:49,744
The weapon was some kind of metal spike.

308
00:14:49,779 --> 00:14:52,447
- Okay. So?
- Councilman Zeller

309
00:14:52,481 --> 00:14:54,716
also has wounds from a metal spike.

310
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:58,053
It's an extremely unlikely
coincidence, don't you think?

311
00:14:58,087 --> 00:14:59,788
So you're saying Zeller,

312
00:14:59,822 --> 00:15:02,157
Jenkins and the aide were
killed by the same person?

313
00:15:02,191 --> 00:15:05,460
It would appear so, wouldn't it?

314
00:15:05,494 --> 00:15:08,797
Same killer working for
both Maroni and Falcone?

315
00:15:08,831 --> 00:15:10,632
That's nuts.

316
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:12,100
(chuckles)

317
00:15:12,134 --> 00:15:14,135
Only in Gotham. Come on.

318
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:15,704
Where are we going?

319
00:15:15,738 --> 00:15:17,739
Go see a friend of mine.

320
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:30,151
What the hell you think you're doing?!

321
00:15:30,186 --> 00:15:31,519
I...

322
00:15:31,554 --> 00:15:33,088
You were snooping, you little worm.

323
00:15:33,122 --> 00:15:34,189
I told you

324
00:15:34,223 --> 00:15:36,725
the day I gave you this job that, in here,

325
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:38,560
you don't see nothing,
you don't hear nothing.

326
00:15:38,594 --> 00:15:40,829
I'm sorry, sir. I... beg your pardon.

327
00:15:40,863 --> 00:15:44,499
You keep that sniveling nose of
yours to yourself, understood?

328
00:15:44,533 --> 00:15:46,534
Yes, sir.

329
00:15:57,513 --> 00:16:00,548
Two cartons. Must be important.

330
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:02,584
- We're looking for a hit man.
- Yeah?

331
00:16:02,618 --> 00:16:04,419
Which family does he work for?

332
00:16:04,453 --> 00:16:06,721
A few. He's an independent type, like you.

333
00:16:06,756 --> 00:16:08,857
Not too many of them still around.

334
00:16:10,226 --> 00:16:11,192
Who'd he hit?

335
00:16:11,227 --> 00:16:13,228
Two city councilmen and an aide.

336
00:16:13,262 --> 00:16:15,363
Uses some sort of special
weapon to kill his victims.

337
00:16:15,398 --> 00:16:17,766
Steel spike?

338
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,768
About so big?

339
00:16:19,802 --> 00:16:22,370
Could be.

340
00:16:22,405 --> 00:16:24,539
- You know him?
- I heard of him.

341
00:16:24,573 --> 00:16:27,742
His name's Gladwell. A real pro.

342
00:16:27,777 --> 00:16:29,577
You know where we can find him?

343
00:16:29,612 --> 00:16:30,779
Word was

344
00:16:30,813 --> 00:16:34,282
he works out of the
Lansky building in Midtown.

345
00:16:37,453 --> 00:16:38,920
- (elevator bell dings)
- You coming or what?

346
00:16:38,954 --> 00:16:40,655
We got 12 more floors to check out.

347
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:41,856
What's got you so wound up?

348
00:16:41,891 --> 00:16:43,091
Maybe I'm just doing my job.

349
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:44,492
No, you've been acting weird lately,

350
00:16:44,527 --> 00:16:46,494
like you got something to hide.

351
00:16:46,529 --> 00:16:48,430
GCPD, ma'am.

352
00:16:48,464 --> 00:16:50,432
We're looking for
someone who may work here.

353
00:16:50,466 --> 00:16:52,133
Last name Gladwell.

354
00:16:52,168 --> 00:16:54,235
Oh, you mean Richard. He
works in Human Resources.

355
00:16:55,604 --> 00:16:57,005
Richard's not in any trouble, is he?

356
00:16:57,039 --> 00:16:58,907
BULLOCK: Which desk is his?

357
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:02,711
Third one from the back.

358
00:17:12,288 --> 00:17:15,023
Gladwell. Richard Gladwell...
has anyone seen him?

359
00:17:15,057 --> 00:17:16,391
You just missed him.

360
00:17:16,425 --> 00:17:18,593
Where'd he go? He was just here.

361
00:17:18,627 --> 00:17:20,462
Maybe he headed out the back?

362
00:17:21,497 --> 00:17:22,997
I'm gonna go check it out.

363
00:17:23,032 --> 00:17:25,066
Stay here in case he comes back?

364
00:18:08,478 --> 00:18:10,612
BULLOCK: Jim!

365
00:18:10,646 --> 00:18:12,381
I found something!

366
00:18:18,189 --> 00:18:20,157
Look what was in his desk.

367
00:18:20,191 --> 00:18:22,126
Jenkins and Zeller. We got him.

368
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,927
Man, I love the easy ones.

369
00:18:26,264 --> 00:18:28,232
(door closes)

370
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:37,941
Freeze!

371
00:18:37,976 --> 00:18:39,576
(gasps)

372
00:18:39,611 --> 00:18:41,178
It's-it's just a box of paperclips.

373
00:18:41,212 --> 00:18:42,813
I didn't think anyone would mind.

374
00:18:42,847 --> 00:18:43,947
- (woman crying)
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

375
00:18:43,982 --> 00:18:45,516
Are you okay?

376
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:46,817
(crying)

377
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,468
"C, L, M."

378
00:18:58,502 --> 00:19:00,904
What do you think it means?

379
00:19:00,938 --> 00:19:03,724
I don't know.

380
00:19:10,948 --> 00:19:13,183
(gasps, panting)

381
00:19:13,217 --> 00:19:15,785
- You all right?
- (sighs)

382
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,121
I'm fine. (sniffles, clears his throat)

383
00:19:18,155 --> 00:19:21,324
- Why?
- Well...

384
00:19:21,358 --> 00:19:23,760
I heard screaming.

385
00:19:23,794 --> 00:19:25,595
A bad dream.

386
00:19:25,629 --> 00:19:27,831
Oh.

387
00:19:29,621 --> 00:19:30,754
Was I in it?

388
00:19:30,788 --> 00:19:34,124
(quiet laugh) Not this time.

389
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,362
Alfred, are there any more
files on the Arkham plant?

390
00:19:38,396 --> 00:19:39,529
Oh, yeah.

391
00:19:39,564 --> 00:19:42,933
Absolutely. Untold. Piles
of the bloody things.

392
00:19:42,967 --> 00:19:47,170
I'd like to see them, please. All of them.

393
00:19:47,205 --> 00:19:49,773
And may I ask, uh, why?

394
00:19:51,809 --> 00:19:54,945
I'm looking for a connection.

395
00:19:54,979 --> 00:19:58,482
Between the councilmen murders
and the murders of my parents.

396
00:19:59,517 --> 00:20:01,718
I see.

397
00:20:03,855 --> 00:20:05,956
(tires screeching)

398
00:20:09,227 --> 00:20:11,895
Nobody move! This is a robbery!

399
00:20:12,764 --> 00:20:14,531
(people screaming)

400
00:20:14,566 --> 00:20:16,400
(gunshot, people screaming)

401
00:20:16,434 --> 00:20:17,668
Money's in the back. Go, go!

402
00:20:17,702 --> 00:20:19,870
Come on... you, too! Get over there!

403
00:20:20,872 --> 00:20:23,473
(gunshots, people screaming)

404
00:20:23,508 --> 00:20:25,008
Move! Move! Move!

405
00:20:28,046 --> 00:20:30,247
(tires squealing)

406
00:20:30,281 --> 00:20:32,316
(people screaming, shouting)

407
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:34,084
(tires squealing)

408
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,321
Move! Out of the way.

409
00:20:37,355 --> 00:20:38,689
(indistinct chatter, woman groaning)

410
00:20:38,723 --> 00:20:40,657
Out of my way.

411
00:20:44,395 --> 00:20:47,064
Check the back.

412
00:20:53,037 --> 00:20:54,738
They got the money, Frankie.

413
00:20:54,772 --> 00:20:57,841
I got eyes, don't I?

414
00:21:21,023 --> 00:21:22,792
(anxious gasping)

415
00:21:22,826 --> 00:21:24,160
Oh, thank goodness you're here.

416
00:21:24,194 --> 00:21:25,628
They had... they had guns, and...

417
00:21:25,662 --> 00:21:28,431
and-and Lou... Lou was hit in the stomach.

418
00:21:28,465 --> 00:21:31,267
- Is-is... is he...?
- Forget about Lou!

419
00:21:31,301 --> 00:21:32,502
Who did this?

420
00:21:32,536 --> 00:21:35,505
Uh... they had masks. I-I couldn't see.

421
00:21:35,539 --> 00:21:37,106
But you got the money.

422
00:21:37,141 --> 00:21:38,141
Oh, yeah.

423
00:21:38,175 --> 00:21:40,977
I managed to hide this
bag, but they got the rest.

424
00:21:41,011 --> 00:21:43,279
- I'm sorry. I...
- Hey, relax, kid.

425
00:21:43,313 --> 00:21:46,149
Save it for the boss.

426
00:21:46,183 --> 00:21:47,984
(panting, groaning)

427
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,222
(door opens)

428
00:21:53,257 --> 00:21:55,258
(door closes)

429
00:21:58,829 --> 00:22:01,964
You're off early for a change.

430
00:22:01,999 --> 00:22:04,000
I missed you.

431
00:22:08,639 --> 00:22:10,706
You all right?

432
00:22:10,741 --> 00:22:12,975
Long hours and late nights, Jim.

433
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:15,978
- They make me worry.
- About what?

434
00:22:16,013 --> 00:22:17,814
All kinds of things.

435
00:22:17,848 --> 00:22:19,448
I'm just doing my job.

436
00:22:19,483 --> 00:22:21,117
Are you?

437
00:22:21,151 --> 00:22:24,387
(sighs) What is that supposed to mean?

438
00:22:24,421 --> 00:22:27,256
It means I think you have secrets from me.

439
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:29,592
And I hate it.

440
00:22:29,626 --> 00:22:31,694
What do you want me to say, Barbara?

441
00:22:31,728 --> 00:22:34,363
Yeah. I have secrets.

442
00:22:34,398 --> 00:22:35,898
It's part of my job.

443
00:22:35,933 --> 00:22:38,100
- It's how I make sure...
- Who's Oswald Cobblepot?

444
00:22:40,604 --> 00:22:42,605
How do you know that name?

445
00:22:42,639 --> 00:22:44,340
Doesn't matter.

446
00:22:44,374 --> 00:22:45,708
Who is he?

447
00:22:47,478 --> 00:22:50,046
I can't even begin to answer that.

448
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,280
Can't or won't?

449
00:22:55,986 --> 00:22:57,587
Montoya.

450
00:22:59,656 --> 00:23:01,757
She came to see you, didn't she?

451
00:23:01,792 --> 00:23:03,092
Yes.

452
00:23:03,126 --> 00:23:05,127
Why does she keep coming to you?

453
00:23:05,162 --> 00:23:06,796
What is there between you and her?

454
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:15,037
Years ago, before I was with you...

455
00:23:15,072 --> 00:23:20,076
she and I were in a relationship.

456
00:23:25,949 --> 00:23:27,783
What?

457
00:23:29,286 --> 00:23:31,254
It only lasted a year,

458
00:23:31,288 --> 00:23:33,723
and then I-I ended it and moved on.

459
00:23:33,757 --> 00:23:36,125
And what, she didn't?

460
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,761
I don't know.

461
00:23:38,795 --> 00:23:41,230
I don't care, okay? Because you are the one

462
00:23:41,265 --> 00:23:43,900
that I want to spend
the rest of my life with.

463
00:23:47,838 --> 00:23:49,806
(wry laugh) What, you're angry?

464
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,742
- What do you think?
- Because she's a woman?

465
00:23:52,776 --> 00:23:54,977
Because... you lied to me!

466
00:23:56,446 --> 00:23:58,147
Okay, I'm sorry.

467
00:23:58,182 --> 00:24:00,183
I should have told you.

468
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:07,419
<i>MARONI: Falcone thinks he could hit me</i>

469
00:24:07,453 --> 00:24:10,122
in my place of business
and get away with it?

470
00:24:10,156 --> 00:24:11,957
He's got another thing coming, Frankie.

471
00:24:11,991 --> 00:24:13,692
I want to hit him back.

472
00:24:13,726 --> 00:24:15,260
This time, where it hurts.

473
00:24:15,294 --> 00:24:17,629
I want to hit The Mouth.

474
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:20,465
MARONI: It's time, son.

475
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,101
CARBONE: I'll take care of it.

476
00:24:24,137 --> 00:24:26,271
Then there's the other thing.

477
00:24:29,008 --> 00:24:31,009
Send him over.

478
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:43,522
(clears throat quietly)

479
00:24:43,556 --> 00:24:45,157
You know I'm a man

480
00:24:45,191 --> 00:24:47,960
that shows appreciation
when appreciation is due.

481
00:24:47,994 --> 00:24:49,628
Yes, Don Maroni.

482
00:24:49,662 --> 00:24:52,631
What you did for me yesterday
did not go unnoticed.

483
00:24:52,665 --> 00:24:53,632
(laughs quietly)

484
00:24:53,666 --> 00:24:54,733
Well, thank you, sir.

485
00:24:54,767 --> 00:24:56,902
I-I only wish I was
able to retrieve the...

486
00:24:56,936 --> 00:24:58,036
- retrieve the other half of your...
- Bup-bup-bup-bup.

487
00:24:58,071 --> 00:25:00,138
Bup.

488
00:25:00,173 --> 00:25:02,607
How long you been washing dishes?

489
00:25:02,642 --> 00:25:05,043
- Not long.
- All right, that ends today.

490
00:25:05,078 --> 00:25:07,679
You've been promoted to restaurant manager.

491
00:25:09,182 --> 00:25:11,917
The position recently became available.

492
00:25:12,919 --> 00:25:15,354
Thank you, Don Maroni.

493
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:17,456
- I won't let you down.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

494
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:18,991
You're welcome.

495
00:25:19,025 --> 00:25:20,225
(sighs)

496
00:25:21,527 --> 00:25:22,861
Frankie, get the kid a suit.

497
00:25:22,895 --> 00:25:24,930
(laughs softly)

498
00:25:49,145 --> 00:25:50,170
He's dead.

499
00:25:51,958 --> 00:25:54,520
- Who?
- Richard Gladwell.

500
00:25:54,564 --> 00:25:58,264
At least the real one.
Since some units by his apartament found

501
00:25:58,313 --> 00:26:00,280
moldy old corpse sealed inside.

502
00:26:00,315 --> 00:26:02,916
Puncture wound through the
eye; been dead five years.

503
00:26:02,951 --> 00:26:05,385
- And no one found him until now?
- Landlord said

504
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:08,388
he paid his rent on time,
kept quiet... the ideal tenant.

505
00:26:08,423 --> 00:26:10,657
So our Hit Man killed this Gladwell

506
00:26:10,692 --> 00:26:12,526
to use his identity as cover.

507
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,061
And it worked, too.

508
00:26:14,095 --> 00:26:17,598
Employee records, payroll,
contact information... all fake.

509
00:26:17,632 --> 00:26:19,800
We got nothing but a face.

510
00:26:19,834 --> 00:26:22,169
Damn.

511
00:26:22,203 --> 00:26:23,604
(sighs) All right...

512
00:26:23,638 --> 00:26:25,606
Well, there's got to be something to this.

513
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,574
"C-L-M."
You got any ideas?

514
00:26:27,609 --> 00:26:30,110
It's a complete waste of time.

515
00:26:30,144 --> 00:26:33,013
It's a lead. Our only lead.

516
00:26:33,047 --> 00:26:35,148
Says you.

517
00:26:35,183 --> 00:26:36,650
You can't be this lazy.

518
00:26:36,684 --> 00:26:39,286
Lazy? Maybe I just work smarter than you.

519
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:42,489
- Ever consider that?
- Yeah. I considered it.

520
00:26:42,523 --> 00:26:44,424
Look, this Arkham vote

521
00:26:44,459 --> 00:26:46,960
is tomorrow... we don't
find this guy by then...

522
00:26:46,995 --> 00:26:48,328
What? What happens?

523
00:26:48,363 --> 00:26:50,430
Worst case: a major gang war.

524
00:26:50,465 --> 00:26:52,399
People will die. Maybe a lot of people.

525
00:26:52,433 --> 00:26:54,368
We find this guy, we can stop it.

526
00:26:57,539 --> 00:26:59,273
And where are you going?

527
00:26:59,307 --> 00:27:00,340
To work the case.

528
00:27:00,375 --> 00:27:02,209
You got your ways, I got mine.

529
00:27:03,244 --> 00:27:05,178
Hey, Harvey...

530
00:27:05,213 --> 00:27:07,347
tell her I said hi.

- (song ends)
- What's your name?

544
00:27:39,547 --> 00:27:41,415
Liza.

545
00:27:41,449 --> 00:27:44,251
How long have you been singing, Liza?

546
00:27:44,285 --> 00:27:46,386
Not long.

547
00:27:47,422 --> 00:27:50,023
You like boys or girls?

548
00:27:52,227 --> 00:27:54,761
Boys.

549
00:27:54,796 --> 00:27:57,531
So... you want the job, or what?

550
00:27:57,565 --> 00:27:59,833
Well, you haven't told me what it is yet.

551
00:27:59,868 --> 00:28:02,202
You want to be a woman with power,

552
00:28:02,237 --> 00:28:04,238
money and respect, like me?

553
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,075
I guess. Yeah.

554
00:28:08,109 --> 00:28:10,010
Are you willing to do whatever it takes

555
00:28:10,044 --> 00:28:11,411
to have it all?

556
00:28:12,447 --> 00:28:14,214
Yes.

557
00:28:14,249 --> 00:28:16,283
I am.

558
00:28:17,318 --> 00:28:18,952
That's the job.

559
00:28:22,824 --> 00:28:24,958
Seduce me.

560
00:28:24,993 --> 00:28:27,361
(laughing): What...?

561
00:28:28,997 --> 00:28:31,398
You think I'm kidding?

562
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:57,491
(exhales softly)

563
00:29:01,629 --> 00:29:03,630
(kisses, sighs)

564
00:29:14,309 --> 00:29:16,076
(exhales)

565
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:31,525
Harvey...

566
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:34,161
you see something you like?

567
00:29:34,195 --> 00:29:35,696
I do now.

568
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:37,998
I need your help.

569
00:29:38,032 --> 00:29:40,434
City councilmen are dropping like flies.

570
00:29:40,468 --> 00:29:42,336
- I heard.
- Bad for business.

571
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:43,804
You're not wrong.

572
00:29:43,838 --> 00:29:46,173
The Button Man's a guy called
Gladwell... you know him?

573
00:29:46,207 --> 00:29:47,808
Only by reputation.

574
00:29:47,842 --> 00:29:49,109
Think you can find him?

575
00:29:49,143 --> 00:29:52,246
I can find anyone if I have the time.

576
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,615
The question is, what's in it for me?

577
00:29:54,649 --> 00:29:57,050
(whispers): I'll owe you.

578
00:30:01,022 --> 00:30:05,192
Okay, but I still think it's
a waste of time, if you ask me.

579
00:30:05,226 --> 00:30:07,995
Falcone'll just get
someone to take his place.

580
00:30:08,029 --> 00:30:09,796
He's not gonna let this bone go.

581
00:30:09,831 --> 00:30:10,880
Why's that?

582
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:14,118
Falcone cannot afford to lose
that vote.

583
00:30:14,143 --> 00:30:16,580
If Moroni gets even a piece
of Arkham,

584
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:19,468
it'll only prove
what we already know.

585
00:30:19,541 --> 00:30:24,077
And that is: Falcone is old and weak.

586
00:30:24,112 --> 00:30:26,179
You seem kinda pleased about that.

587
00:30:26,214 --> 00:30:27,814
How come?

588
00:30:27,849 --> 00:30:29,416
Falcone goes down, so do you.

589
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:30,984
Harvey...

590
00:30:31,019 --> 00:30:34,421
don't you worry about me.

591
00:30:34,455 --> 00:30:38,158
I always have a Plan B.

592
00:30:43,531 --> 00:30:44,865
(phone rings)

593
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,769
- Detective Gordon.
- Hello, old friend.

594
00:30:50,538 --> 00:30:52,573
What do you want?

595
00:30:52,607 --> 00:30:54,675
To offer you help.

596
00:30:54,709 --> 00:30:57,311
To prove that you can trust me.

597
00:30:57,345 --> 00:30:59,446
There's gonna be another murder.

598
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,248
Maroni has put out the hit.

599
00:31:01,282 --> 00:31:02,549
Who's the target?

600
00:31:02,584 --> 00:31:04,251
Someone backing Falcone's plan.

601
00:31:04,285 --> 00:31:06,253
Who it is, I can't be certain.

602
00:31:06,287 --> 00:31:08,889
All the councilmen are under
police protection tonight.

603
00:31:08,923 --> 00:31:10,224
(chuckles)

604
00:31:10,258 --> 00:31:12,593
There are many ways around the police.

605
00:31:12,627 --> 00:31:14,828
But the hit will happen tonight...

606
00:31:14,862 --> 00:31:16,263
that much I can be certain of.

607
00:31:16,297 --> 00:31:17,764
How do you know this?

608
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:20,367
I told you, Detective...

609
00:31:20,401 --> 00:31:23,804
Gotham is my home.

610
00:31:39,988 --> 00:31:41,388
I need a list of the officers

611
00:31:41,422 --> 00:31:42,890
working police protection tonight.

612
00:31:46,327 --> 00:31:49,062
Campos, Lazenby, Martins.

613
00:31:49,097 --> 00:31:51,398
C-L-M.

614
00:31:54,669 --> 00:31:55,969
VOICEMAIL: It's Harvey. (beep)

615
00:31:56,004 --> 00:31:58,438
Bullock, I found out who
Gladwell's next target is.

616
00:31:58,473 --> 00:32:00,307
It's the mayor.

617
00:32:21,796 --> 00:32:23,063
Detective Gordon. What's going on?

618
00:32:23,097 --> 00:32:25,098
Sir, I think your life may be in danger.

619
00:32:25,133 --> 00:32:27,968
- I need to get you out of here.
- What? No, I...

620
00:32:28,002 --> 00:32:29,369
I'm not going anywhere...
I got police protection.

621
00:32:29,404 --> 00:32:31,438
- They're gone.
- What?

622
00:32:31,472 --> 00:32:32,906
I just checked, no one's out there.

623
00:32:32,941 --> 00:32:34,908
Sir, I think someone's
coming here to kill you.

624
00:32:34,943 --> 00:32:36,610
I got to get some things from my safe.

625
00:32:58,366 --> 00:33:02,069
(safe opens)

626
00:33:02,103 --> 00:33:05,038
- Sir, we need to go... now.
- I'm moving as fast as I can.

627
00:33:05,073 --> 00:33:06,039
Is there someplace I can take you?

628
00:33:06,074 --> 00:33:07,541
Somewhere you'll be safe?

629
00:33:07,575 --> 00:33:09,009
We're not going to the police station?

630
00:33:09,043 --> 00:33:11,511
I'm not sure you'll be
safe there. The police...

631
00:33:14,015 --> 00:33:15,849
- What the hell is this town coming to?
- Sir.

632
00:33:15,884 --> 00:33:17,851
All right, all right, I'm...

633
00:33:17,886 --> 00:33:20,754
My sister's house. It's across town.

634
00:33:32,767 --> 00:33:34,768
Let's go.

635
00:33:47,715 --> 00:33:49,349
Go! Go! Go!

636
00:33:53,621 --> 00:33:55,088
GORDON: Is there another way out?

637
00:33:55,123 --> 00:33:57,124
Here.

638
00:34:00,695 --> 00:34:02,196
(thumping) He's trying to get in.

639
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:04,031
Shoot him. Why don't you shoot him?

640
00:34:04,065 --> 00:34:05,899
He's got my gun. I can't. Go, go, go!

641
00:34:05,934 --> 00:34:08,569
(gunshots)

642
00:34:41,102 --> 00:34:43,070
Drop it!

643
00:34:43,104 --> 00:34:44,738
Drop it or I'll shoot!

644
00:34:55,183 --> 00:34:56,917
You know why they hire a professional?

645
00:34:58,653 --> 00:35:00,020
'Cause he finishes the job.

646
00:35:37,245 --> 00:35:39,279
How are you?

647
00:35:39,314 --> 00:35:40,814
Okay.

648
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:46,153
Jim, I should've told you
about Montoya a long time ago.

649
00:35:46,187 --> 00:35:49,156
- Then why didn't you?
- I don't know.

650
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:52,493
Because she works with you.

651
00:35:52,527 --> 00:35:54,428
Because she's a woman.

652
00:35:54,462 --> 00:35:58,098
Are you sure there isn't another reason?

653
00:35:58,132 --> 00:36:00,934
No. There's nothing else.

654
00:36:00,969 --> 00:36:04,872
Jim, I don't want there to
be any secrets between us.

655
00:36:04,906 --> 00:36:07,007
- Neither do I.
- Good.

656
00:36:07,041 --> 00:36:10,344
So you'll tell me who Oswald Cobblepot is.

657
00:36:13,348 --> 00:36:15,182
Damn it, Barbara. Why can't you drop this?

658
00:36:15,216 --> 00:36:18,285
- Why can't you just tell me who he is?
- Because...

659
00:36:19,287 --> 00:36:22,156
it's work. (sighs)

660
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:24,525
I know. But you've told
me about your work before.

661
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:26,693
And that was a mistake.

662
00:36:26,728 --> 00:36:29,830
One I am not going to make again.

663
00:36:35,403 --> 00:36:37,571
All right. Well...

664
00:36:37,605 --> 00:36:40,107
I'm not gonna live like this.

665
00:36:42,076 --> 00:36:43,944
I can't live like this.

666
00:36:43,978 --> 00:36:48,615
You're gonna have to make a choice, Jim.

667
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:51,685
You either let me in or you let me go.

668
00:37:01,029 --> 00:37:03,030
(scoffs)

669
00:37:24,385 --> 00:37:25,719
<i>MOONEY: All right.</i>

670
00:37:25,753 --> 00:37:28,722
I'm going to cut to the chase.

671
00:37:28,756 --> 00:37:33,760
I like you both, but I
only have one opening.

672
00:37:33,795 --> 00:37:36,196
You've got the talent.

673
00:37:36,231 --> 00:37:38,232
And you've got...

674
00:37:39,267 --> 00:37:41,034
something else.

675
00:37:41,069 --> 00:37:45,038
I can't decide, so...

676
00:37:45,073 --> 00:37:48,709
you two are going to have to do it for me.

677
00:37:55,583 --> 00:37:58,085
You want us to fight for it?

678
00:38:05,293 --> 00:38:07,694
(grunting)

679
00:38:22,644 --> 00:38:24,645
(panting)

680
00:38:33,054 --> 00:38:35,556
So when do I start?

681
00:38:52,507 --> 00:38:54,474
It's you. (chuckles)

682
00:38:54,509 --> 00:38:56,476
Scared us there for a second.

683
00:39:03,384 --> 00:39:05,485
We do good or what?

684
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,087
Excellent work, my friends.

685
00:39:07,121 --> 00:39:10,190
- You were very convincing.
- Yeah, I bet that manager

686
00:39:10,225 --> 00:39:11,859
sure thought so, huh?
Ain't that right, Dickie?

687
00:39:11,893 --> 00:39:13,627
(mimics gunshots, laughs) (mimics gunshot)

688
00:39:13,661 --> 00:39:15,696
(men laughing)

689
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:17,831
You got any other joints you
want us to rob, let us know.

690
00:39:17,866 --> 00:39:19,533
- Good money in this.
- Yeah, good money.

691
00:39:23,238 --> 00:39:25,439
What's that?

692
00:39:25,473 --> 00:39:28,041
Oh, I brought cannoli.

693
00:39:28,076 --> 00:39:30,077
Oh, yeah! Ha!

694
00:39:33,014 --> 00:39:34,214
Now, eat up.

695
00:39:34,249 --> 00:39:36,283
You guys deserve this.

696
00:39:36,317 --> 00:39:37,951
Oh.

697
00:39:37,986 --> 00:39:39,853
Mmm! Check this out.

698
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:46,360
Mmm! Mmm! Really good.

699
00:39:46,394 --> 00:39:47,361
Oh, real good.

700
00:39:47,395 --> 00:39:50,497
Mmm! Mmm!

701
00:39:57,338 --> 00:39:58,739
<i>TV REPORTER: The Arkham development vote</i>

702
00:39:58,773 --> 00:40:00,941
<i>has been a topic of controversy for weeks.</i>

703
00:40:00,975 --> 00:40:02,309
<i>Today we have the results.</i>

704
00:40:02,343 --> 00:40:04,912
<i>We go live now to Mayor
James's press conference.</i>

705
00:40:04,946 --> 00:40:07,181
Do you mind turning that
down? My head's killing me.

706
00:40:07,215 --> 00:40:08,649
Aw, shut up.

707
00:40:08,683 --> 00:40:10,717
This is what we worked for.

708
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:12,319
We did this.

709
00:40:12,353 --> 00:40:14,588
<i>How is today's outcome not simply a failure</i>

710
00:40:14,622 --> 00:40:15,856
<i>of the Wayne plan?</i>

711
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:18,058
This is not a case of either plan failing.

712
00:40:18,092 --> 00:40:19,927
This is a case of compromise

713
00:40:19,961 --> 00:40:22,529
for what's best for the people of Gotham.

714
00:40:22,564 --> 00:40:24,865
The Arkham district will be developed

715
00:40:24,899 --> 00:40:27,701
into both low-cost housing as well

716
00:40:27,735 --> 00:40:30,370
as a much-needed site for waste disposal.

717
00:40:30,405 --> 00:40:32,573
This is the best of both plans...

718
00:40:32,607 --> 00:40:34,741
together in one.

719
00:40:34,776 --> 00:40:36,944
- (men chuckling)
- Yes.

720
00:40:36,978 --> 00:40:41,148
For years, this city's been
giving us nothing but scraps.

721
00:40:41,182 --> 00:40:43,984
But from now on...

722
00:40:44,018 --> 00:40:45,919
from now on...

723
00:40:45,954 --> 00:40:47,588
we feast.

724
00:40:47,622 --> 00:40:50,190
(men agreeing, chuckling)

725
00:40:50,225 --> 00:40:51,859
Mayor James, what about the asylum?

726
00:40:51,893 --> 00:40:53,460
What's going to happen to it?

727
00:40:53,494 --> 00:40:55,596
AUBREY: Arkham Asylum will be retrofitted

728
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:57,598
to meet today's standards and reopened.

729
00:40:57,632 --> 00:40:59,433
Gotham needs... No,

730
00:40:59,467 --> 00:41:01,435
<i>Gotham deserves</i>

731
00:41:01,469 --> 00:41:03,770
a world-class treatment facility

732
00:41:03,805 --> 00:41:05,772
for the mentally ill.

733
00:41:05,807 --> 00:41:08,709
Falcone took a shot to the body today.

734
00:41:08,743 --> 00:41:13,614
Maybe a few more will put him on his back.

735
00:41:15,617 --> 00:41:19,786
Looks like I got you just in time.

736
00:41:19,821 --> 00:41:21,955
And I know that the Waynes,

737
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:24,424
were they still alive,

738
00:41:24,459 --> 00:41:28,262
would be proud of what we've
been able to accomplish today.

739
00:41:33,034 --> 00:41:36,403
The mayor's making this new plan
sound like it's good for Gotham.

740
00:41:36,437 --> 00:41:38,972
- But-but it's not, is it?
- No, it's not.

741
00:41:39,007 --> 00:41:40,374
Then why is he doing it?

742
00:41:40,408 --> 00:41:43,610
He was caught between two
very powerful opposing forces.

743
00:41:43,645 --> 00:41:45,312
- Falcone and Maroni.
- Maroni threatened

744
00:41:45,346 --> 00:41:46,780
the mayor's life.

745
00:41:46,814 --> 00:41:48,582
Out of fear, I'm guessing,

746
00:41:48,616 --> 00:41:50,117
the mayor made a compromise

747
00:41:50,151 --> 00:41:52,085
and gave Maroni a huge piece of Arkham.

748
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,253
What piece?

749
00:41:53,288 --> 00:41:56,290
Maroni gets to build a waste disposal site

750
00:41:56,324 --> 00:41:59,193
and he gets the contract
to refurbish Arkham.

751
00:41:59,227 --> 00:42:02,162
Falcone gets to build a
low-income housing project.

752
00:42:02,197 --> 00:42:04,832
(sighs)

753
00:42:04,866 --> 00:42:06,366
Look...

754
00:42:06,401 --> 00:42:11,205
Bruce, I know it's not the
outcome you had hoped for,

755
00:42:11,239 --> 00:42:14,141
but this compromise

756
00:42:14,175 --> 00:42:17,477
may have prevented a lot of bloodshed.

757
00:42:17,512 --> 00:42:19,947
It may have even stopped a war.

758
00:42:19,981 --> 00:42:24,218
My parents believed a new asylum
would bring hope to Gotham.

759
00:42:24,252 --> 00:42:25,886
Now that's gone.

760
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,287
Everything they worked for

761
00:42:27,322 --> 00:42:29,289
is now falling into the hands of criminals.

762
00:42:29,324 --> 00:42:31,959
Not everything.

763
00:42:31,993 --> 00:42:33,894
You're alive.

764
00:42:35,597 --> 00:42:37,731
It's not too late.

765
00:42:39,267 --> 00:42:42,002
Do you really believe that?

766
00:42:44,873 --> 00:42:47,474
Do you believe Gotham can be saved?

767
00:42:49,143 --> 00:42:51,973
I believe it's worth trying.

768
00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:23,414
