1
00:00:00,709 --> 00:00:02,085
MY NAME IS OLIVER QUEEN.

2
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:04,546
FOR 7 YEARS, I HAVE FOUGHT
WITH ONLY ONE GOAL...

3
00:00:04,588 --> 00:00:05,798
TO SAVE MY CITY,

4
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,424
BUT NOW A NEW THREAT
HAS EMERGED,

5
00:00:07,466 --> 00:00:09,050
A DANGER SO SEVERE,
IT HAS FORCED ME

6
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:11,010
TO LEAVE MY FAMILY
IN ORDER TO FACE IT,

7
00:00:11,052 --> 00:00:13,764
AND IT WON'T BE ENOUGH FOR ME
TO JUST BE THE GREEN ARROW.

8
00:00:13,806 --> 00:00:15,432
TO PREVENT THE CRISIS
THAT'S COMING,

9
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:17,601
I AM GOING TO HAVE TO BECOME
SOMEONE ELSE.

10
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:20,020
I AM GOING TO HAVE
TO BECOME...SOMETHING ELSE.

11
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:22,773
PREVIOUSLY ON "ARROW"...

12
00:00:22,815 --> 00:00:24,566
EARTH-2 IS...GONE.

13
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:26,151
THE DESTRUCTION
OF THAT EARTH WAS

14
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:27,945
A NECESSARY SACRIFICE.

15
00:00:27,987 --> 00:00:31,072
MAR NOVU IS NOT TRYING TO
PREVENT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN

16
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:33,116
BECAUSE HE'S GONNA BE
WHAT CAUSES IT.

17
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:35,661
JOHN DIGGLE IS
MY ADOPTIVE FATHER.

18
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:37,830
-THANKS, MR. DIGGLES.
-CALL ME DIG.

19
00:00:37,872 --> 00:00:40,415
WE HAVE TO TAKE OUT
THE DEATHSTROKES.

OH, MY GOD. DAD!

HEY.

00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,119
MIA?

30
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:19,788
MIA?

WELL, YOU'RE
SO YOUNG.

33
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:27,963
DAD?

34
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:29,673
WHAT IS THIS?
HOW DID THEY GET HERE?

35
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:31,550
I...I DON'T KNOW.

36
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:36,304
THOSE ARE MY KIDS.

37
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:38,473
DINAH: YOUR KIDS.

38
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:41,018
ARE YOU...ARE YOU OK?

39
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,062
H-HOW IS THIS REAL?

40
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:45,022
RENE: GOOD QUESTION.
THE LAST TIME I CHECKED,

41
00:01:45,064 --> 00:01:48,233
YOU DIDN'T HAVE
AN ADULT DAUGHTER
OR ANY DAUGHTER.

42
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:51,152
WE HAD A DAUGHTER...

43
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:53,405
AND WE NAMED HER MIA.

44
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:56,408
FELICITY GAVE BIRTH
A FEW MONTHS AFTER WE
LEFT STAR CITY.

45
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:00,079
HOW? I...I DIDN'T EVEN
KNOW SHE WAS PREGNANT.

46
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,455
OLIVER: WE DIDN'T
TELL ANYONE.

47
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:03,498
WE WANTED TO KEEP HER
OFF THE GRID

48
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,459
TO PROTECT HER.

49
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,210
THAT WAS ONLY
A FEW MONTHS AGO.

50
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,757
THIS IS NOVU.

51
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:13,174
YOU CALLED ME DAD.

52
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:15,135
YOU ADOPTED ME.

53
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:16,929
REMEMBER?
IT'S CONNOR.

54
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:22,142
NO. NO. I...I...
I HAVEN'T.

55
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:27,022
HE HASN'T BECAUSE
HE HASN'T YET.

56
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:29,608
LOOK. WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

57
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,443
I THINK WE'RE
IN THE PAST.

58
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,988
-THAT IS INSANE.
-LOOK AT THIS PLACE.

59
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:36,281
IT'S NEW,
AND THEM!

60
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:37,950
NO GRAY HAIR,
NO WRINKLES,

61
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:41,536
AND WE ARE STARING
AT OUR DAD ALIVE

62
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,413
INSTEAD OF
AT HIS TOMBSTONE.

63
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:45,415
I'M SORRY.
WHAT YEAR IS THIS?

64
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:49,837
2-2...UH, IT'S 2019.

65
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:52,297
WHAT YEAR IS IT
SUPPOSED TO BE?

66
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:53,715
2040.

67
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:05,268
JOHN: WAIT. SO AN HOUR AGO,
I WAS JUST WITH BEN TURNER'S
6-YEAR-OLD CHILD,

68
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,186
AND NOW HE'S AN ADULT,
AND NOW I'M HIS FATHER?

69
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:09,397
AT LEAST YOU
DIDN'T THROW UP
LIKE YOU USUALLY DO.

70
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,899
JUST SAYING.

71
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:11,984
I'M GENUINELY SORRY
THAT BOTH OF YOU

72
00:03:12,026 --> 00:03:14,111
FOUND OUT THIS WAY,

73
00:03:14,153 --> 00:03:18,032
ABOUT MIA,
ABOUT THE MONITOR.

74
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:19,950
FELICITY AND I WANTED
TO TELL YOU.

75
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:21,618
OLIVER, AS FAR
AS EXCUSES GO,

76
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,038
A COSMIC BEING ASKING YOU
TO SACRIFICE YOUR LIFE

77
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:27,582
TO SAVE THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE
IS A...PRETTY GOOD ONE.

78
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:30,878
LOOK. THOSE KIDS
HAVE 20 YEARS OF
STUFF WE DON'T KNOW.

79
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,047
WHEN ARE WE GONNA
BE ABLE TO ASK THEM
WHAT HAPPENS?

80
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:34,631
I THINK WE SHOULD GIVE
THEM THEIR SPACE,

81
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:37,009
AND WHEN THEY'RE READY,
THEY'LL OPEN UP.

82
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:39,344
OK. LAUREL'S ON HER
WAY TO STAR CITY.

83
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:42,139
DINAH: I CAN'T BELIEVE
HER ENTIRE EARTH
IS JUST GONE.

84
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:44,599
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WHY DIDN'T THE MONITOR
BRING HER HERE?

85
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,267
OR GROWN-UP JJ
OR ZOE?

86
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:47,519
WHAT GAME IS
HE PLAYING?

87
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:50,397
I DON'T KNOW,

88
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:51,690
BUT WE HAVE
TO STOP HIM.

89
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:54,401
HOW DO WE STOP
A GOD?

90
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,319
I'M WORKING ON IT.

91
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:59,698
OK. HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?
THIS CAN'T BE REAL.

92
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,534
WELL, IT IS.

93
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,828
HEY. ARE YOU OK?

94
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,581
I'M FINE. YEAH.
JUST PLEASE TELL ME

95
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,875
THAT YOU WERE ABLE
TO GET JJ.

96
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:14,254
I HAD HIM,
AND I WAS GONNA...KILL HIM,

97
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:17,716
AND THE NEXT THING I KNOW,
I'M...I'M HERE.

98
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:19,342
SO HE'S STILL
OUT THERE.

99
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,469
YOU MEAN, OUT THERE
20 YEARS IN THE FUTURE

100
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,055
UNLESS YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT THE CURRENT JJ,

101
00:04:23,097 --> 00:04:24,514
WHO'D BE, LIKE, WHAT, 5?

102
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:27,726
AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA
THWICK HIM.

103
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:30,187
MIA?

104
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:32,106
NO, I'M NOT, OK?

105
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:33,815
HOW DOES THIS
EVEN WORK, ALL RIGHT?

106
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:35,984
BECAUSE MY DAD DOESN'T
EVEN KNOW WHO I AM,

107
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:37,861
AND IF HE FINDS OUT
ABOUT JJ, WHAT HE DID,

108
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:41,573
WHAT I...WHAT I
ALMOST DID,

109
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,117
HE WON'T WANT TO.

110
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:46,036
SO DON'T TELL HIM.

111
00:04:46,078 --> 00:04:48,122
DON'T TELL
ANYONE ANYTHING.

112
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:50,624
-ARE YOU SERIOUS?
-SHE'S RIGHT.

113
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,584
THIS IS ORIGINAL
TEAM ARROW WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT.

114
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,419
THEY ARE GONNA KNOW
SOMETHING'S UP.

115
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,379
DO YOU WANT TO
TELL RENE HIS
DAUGHTER'S DEAD

116
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:59,716
OR TELL JOHN THAT
HIS SON'S THE ONE
WHO DID IT?

117
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:01,093
WHAT'S DONE
IS DONE.

118
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:11,937
WILLIAM: WOW. THIS PLACE
LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE IT DID

119
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:14,064
WHEN I WAS 13,

120
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:18,026
WHICH MAKES SENSE
BECAUSE I GUESS
I STILL AM.

121
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:19,111
SORRY ABOUT
THE BOXES.

122
00:05:19,153 --> 00:05:21,321
FELICITY AND I LEFT
PRETTY SUDDENLY

123
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:22,990
TO GET
TO THE CABIN,

124
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,866
AND WE
HAD PLANNED TO

125
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:27,828
COME BACK HERE
WITH BOTH OF YOU
AT SOME POINT.

126
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:32,332
YEAH. THAT, UM,
DIDN'T REALLY WORK OUT.

127
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:34,709
BECAUSE I DIED?

128
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,670
WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY.

129
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,713
YOU JUST SORT OF
DISAPPEARED.

130
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:45,262
SO DID, UH...LOOKS
LIKE THE TWO OF YOU

131
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:49,308
GOT A CHANCE TO...
TO GROW UP
WITH EACH OTHER.

132
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:53,937
UM...ACTUALLY, UM,
MIA AND I

133
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:56,773
JUST FOUND OUT
ABOUT EACH OTHER RECENTLY.

134
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:58,692
I NEVER SAW FELICITY
GROWING UP,

135
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:01,778
AND...AND AFTER
I LEFT HERE,

136
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,031
I NEVER SAW YOU AGAIN.

137
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,950
YEAH. AFTER YOU DIED,
IT WAS, UM,

138
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:08,618
JUST ME AND MOM
AT THE CABIN.

139
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:14,166
I'M SORRY THAT
I WASN'T THERE
FOR THE TWO OF YOU.

140
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,126
HOWEVER, WE ARE
HERE NOW.

141
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:18,670
UM, WHY DON'T WE
SIT DOWN,

142
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:21,422
AND YOU GUYS CAN
CATCH ME UP
TO SPEED OR...

143
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,717
ON 20 YEARS?

144
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:26,178
IT DOESN'T REALLY
WORK THAT WAY.

145
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,429
EVEN IF IT DID,
I'M JUST...I'M TIRED.

146
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:31,975
I WANT TO SLEEP,
AND I...YOU KNOW?

147
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:36,646
YEP. WELL,
THE BEDROOM IS
RIGHT THERE.

148
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:38,439
JUST PLEASE MAKE
YOURSELF AT HOME, OK?

149
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:39,941
YEAH. SURE.

150
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:43,486
NIGHT.

151
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:51,870
THIS IS GONNA BE...
INTERESTING.

152
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:53,205
WHO ARE YOU CALLING?

153
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,959
FELICITY. SHE NEEDS
TO KNOW THAT

154
00:06:58,001 --> 00:06:59,211
THE TWO OF YOU
ARE BACK.

155
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:01,213
-YOU CAN'T.
-WHY?

156
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:04,507
LOOK. I'M NOT EXACTLY
HOW SURE THIS
TIME TRAVEL THING WORKS.

157
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:07,302
MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T...
BRING MOM INTO THIS

A BETTER UNDERSTANDING

00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,514
OF WHAT...THIS IS.

160
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,100
THAT'S A GOOD POINT.

161
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,271
WILLIAM, TELL ME
SOMETHING GOOD

162
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:20,107
ABOUT THE FUTURE,
PLEASE.

163
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:23,610
WELL...YOU KNOW
THOSE COMPUTER PROJECTS

164
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:25,904
THAT I WOULD WORK ON
IN MY ROOM

165
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:28,031
WHEN I WASN'T
TALKING TO YOU?

166
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:30,909
-YEAH.
-I TURNED THAT TEEN ANGST

THAT'S PHENOMENAL.
THAT'S, UM...

00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:43,463
I GET THE FEELING
I'M GONNA BE REALLY...

171
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:47,217
REALLY, REALLY PROUD
OF HOW YOU TURNED OUT.

172
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:53,932
YEAH. WELL, UM...
I DIDN'T JUST
TURN OUT.

173
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:57,227
UM...THERE'S SOMETHING
I SHOULD TELL YOU.

174
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:02,523
I'M GAY.

175
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:09,114
YEAH, BUDDY.

WELL, WE HOPED THAT
YOU WERE GONNA

180
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:23,878
COME OUT TO US WHEN
YOU WERE COMFORTABLE.

181

YOU CLEARLY DIDN'T
GET THAT CHANCE,

182
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:31,011
AND THAT'S ON ME,
SO...I'M SORRY.

TO GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER NOW.

WILL LET ME.

A LITTLE BIT STUBBORN

AND...HARD TO REACH
SOMETIMES.

188

SHOCKER. WHERE'D SHE
GET THAT FROM?

PLEASE TELL ME THE CITY'S
BETTER IN THE FUTURE.

YEAH, YEAH,
DEFINITELY.

-NO. NO, NO.

SO THIS IS
SOMEONE NEW?

YEP. SOMEONE HAS CO-OPTED
THE DEATHSTROKE MASK,

AND THEY'RE USING IT
TO TERRORIZE THE CITY.

OH, IT FEELS SO GOOD TO
BE BACK. WAIT. ARE THOSE
THE KIDS FROM THE FUTURE?

ABOUT THIS, COUNCILMAN RAMIREZ?

COFFEE ON THE PLANE,

228
00:10:26,585 --> 00:10:28,086
AND BY "MAY HAVE,"
I MEAN I DEFINITELY
DID HAVE IT.

AND I HAVE
SO MANY QUESTIONS,

239
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:53,987
STARTING WITH
WHY DID NOBODY

240
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,530
SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT MY BEARD?

241

IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU, CURTIS.
YOUR BEARD LOOKS TREMENDOUS, OK?

242
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:00,243
I MEAN, WORK OR OTHERWISE,
I'D LIKE YOU TO STAY.

243
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:04,747
MIA: YEAH. NO. I JUST, UM...
I'D RATHER SEE THE CITY
THAN THE BUNKER.

245

BELIEVE THAT'S YOUR SON,
THAT'S WILLIAM.

246
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,797
I CAN, HOWEVER, DEFINITELY
BELIEVE THAT THAT
IS YOUR DAUGHTER.

247
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,508
-OK.
-YEAH.

248
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:15,800
SPEAKING OF WHICH,
I'M A LITTLE UPSET

249
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:17,218
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
ABOUT HER,
BUT THAT'S OK.

250
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,639
I FORGIVE YOU.
SO WHY'D YOU CALL
IN THE BIG GUNS?

-YOU KNOW EARTH-2?
-YEAH.

TO TRY AND HELP ME
FIGURE OUT WHAT IT IS.

255
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:32,775
I CAN TRACK DOWN
SOME EQUIPMENT.

256
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:35,278
IT MIGHT...TAKE
A BIT.

257
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,322
THE REASON WHY
I WOULD HELP.

258
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:39,866
IT'S A WAVE OF ENERGY
THAT'S POWERFUL ENOUGH
TO DESTROY A PLANET,

259
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:43,411
SO IT'S PROBABLY POWERFUL
ENOUGH TO STOP A GOD,

260
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:47,123
WHICH IS...WHAT WE'RE
DOING NOW.

261
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:49,708
GOD. YOU SAID GOD.
UM, SO THE FATE

262

IS IN MY HANDS.

YEAH. YOU GUYS...
I GOT IT. AHEM.

HEY. LYLA IS STILL
OFF THE GRID,

265
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:03,097
BUT SHE'LL BE VERY HAPPY
TO SEE YOU.

266
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:06,643
YOU KNOW, WE ALWAYS WANTED
A BROTHER FOR JJ.

267
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:10,063
-YOU AND HE CLOSE?
-YEAH. BEST FRIENDS.

268
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,772
GLAD TO HEAR THAT.

269
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,692
I DIDN'T KNOW THIS WAS
BRING YOUR KID TO WORK DAY.

270
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:15,318
EH. THOUGHT I MIGHT
BE ABLE TO HELP.

271

FORGET IT.

00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:35,630
YEAH.

280
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:37,173

THIS BEFORE.

281

A, UM, TERRORIST

THEY USE THESE

283
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,013
DO YOU HAVE
A BLACK LIGHT?

284
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:47,350
YEAH, BUT WE RAN
THE INKS ON IT ALREADY.
NOTHING TURNED UP.

285
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:51,271
THAT IS BECAUSE YOU
CHECKED IT DRY.

286
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,856
WHOA. OK. SO THAT'S OUR MOTIVE.

287
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:56,109
THAT'S GOOD WORK, CONNOR.

288
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,069
IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE
YOU RECOGNIZE?

289
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:00,029
NO. UH, THAT'S IT.

290

[CELL PHONE CHIMES
AND VIBRATES]

291
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,784

292
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:08,705
GO. GO, GO, GO.
I'LL CATCH UP
WITH YOU LATER.

293

WILLIAM: IT CAN'T REALLY
BE JJ, CAN IT?

294
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,875
LOOK. THIS ALL STARTED
THE NIGHT WE GOT HERE.

295
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,919
MAYBE JJ CAME BACK, TOO.

296
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,963
WHAT, AND THE FIRST THING
HE DECIDES TO DO IS
BLOW SOMETHING UP?

297
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:18,506
IT DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE.

298
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:20,508
IT DOES IF YOU
KNOW MY BROTHER.

"STAR CITY'S CANCER
IS THE RICH"...

300
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,971
IT'S JJ'S FAVORITE
CATCHPHRASE.

301
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:27,098
OK. WE SHOULD TELL DAD
AND THE TEAM.

302
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,310
NOT A CHANCE.
THIS IS OUR MESS
TO CLEAN UP.

303
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,894
BUT WE COULD USE
THEIR HELP.

304
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:34,564
I MEAN, MAYBE IF JJ
SEES JOHN, THEN...

305
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:35,856
HE WON'T CARE.

306
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,900
JJ WILL KILL DAD
IF HE GETS IN HIS WAY.

307
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,402
THIS IS ON US.

308

GRANT WILSON'S PLAN.

466
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:53,753
ARE YOU CRAZY?
HOW CAN YOU NOT
LIKE MINT CHIP?

467
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:56,005
IT TASTES LIKE
TOOTHPASTE.

468
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:58,799
AUNT DINAH? I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE GONNA BE HERE.

469
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:01,844
HEY, KIDDO.
GIVE ME A SQUEEZE.

470
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:06,724
YOU WANT TO TALK
TO MY DAD, HUH?

471
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:08,142
-I'LL GO START SCOOPING.
-HEY, HEY.

472
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:10,186
DON'T EAT ALL
THE ICE CREAM.

473
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:28,370
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO
WAKE UP EVERY MORNING

474
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,831
KNOWING HOW MANY DAYS
WE HAVE LEFT TOGETHER?

475
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,920
BY TRYING TO CHANGE
WHAT HAPPENS,

476
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:38,631
TRYING EVERY SINGLE DAY.

477
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:48,474
WE SHOULD TALK.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

478
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:50,434
I'M GOING TO THE HOSPITAL
BOMB SITE.

479
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:51,978
MAYBE DINAH
MISSED SOMETHING.

480
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:54,063
-MIA.
-I'M NOT GONNA STAND AROUND

481
00:21:54,105 --> 00:21:55,189
AND WASTE TIME.

482
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:57,233
LOOK. I KNOW WHAT'S
DRIVING YOU RIGHT NOW.

483
00:21:57,275 --> 00:21:58,276
YOU LOST A TEAMMATE.

484
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,153
I...I...I'VE BEEN THERE.

485
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:01,862
I...I CAN HELP.
I'M HERE TO HELP.

486
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:04,531
YOU KNOW, I SURVIVED
MY WHOLE LIFE
WITHOUT YOU.

487
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,284
I DON'T NEED YOU
TO PLAY DAD NOW.

488
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,452
HEY. I'M NOT PLAYING DAD.
I AM SIMPLY TELLING YOU

489
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:10,246
THAT IT IS NOT
TACTICALLY WISE
TO GO OUT THERE

490
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:11,538
BY YOURSELF...

491
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,832
FINE. I'LL TAKE LAUREL.

492
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:14,167
WHEN YOU ARE LETTING
YOUR DECISIONS

493
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:16,294
BE DRIVEN
BY YOUR EMOTIONS.

494
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,962
TRUST ME. I'VE BEEN THERE.

495
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:19,546
YOU DON'T GET A SAY.

496
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:20,923
YOU GAVE UP THAT RIGHT
WHEN YOU LEFT

497
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:24,593
ME AND MOM ALONE
IN THAT CABIN.

498
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:26,344
HOW COULD YOU JUST
ABANDON US?

499
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:28,055
BECAUSE I CHOSE TO
KEEP YOU SAFE,
AND I CHOSE RIGHT.

500
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:30,183
YOU JUST WANTED
TO BE A HERO,

501
00:22:30,224 --> 00:22:34,187
SO YOU PUT YOUR MISSION
ABOVE YOUR FAMILY.

502
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:38,524
DON'T WORRY. YOU'LL
LEARN TO LIVE WITHOUT
ME PRETTY EASY

503
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:40,318
JUST LIKE I LEARNED
TO LIVE WITHOUT YOU.

504
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:42,903
AHEM.

505
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:45,405
I'M NOT LETTING YOU GO
OUT THERE.

506
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:48,242
NYSSA AL GHUL
TRAINED ME.

507
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:49,827
YOU WANT TO SEE
HOW WELL?

508
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:51,495
I'M NOT GONNA FIGHT YOU.
I'M YOUR FATHER.

509
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:53,539
REALLY? BECAUSE
FROM WHERE I STAND,

510
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,333
YOU'RE JUST SOME GUY
IN MY WAY.

511
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:58,961
LAUREL: MIA...

512
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:03,090
I'LL GO WITH YOU.

513
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:10,348
LET'S GO.

514
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:19,773
UH...DAD, I KNOW
THIS IS BAD TIMING,

515
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,150
BUT YOU SHOULD
SEE THIS.

516
00:23:21,192 --> 00:23:22,526
IT'S LIVE.

517
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:28,991
GRANT: 6 YEARS AGO,
MY FATHER RAINED TERROR
DOWN ON THIS CITY.

518
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:31,702
HE WAS SHORT-SIGHTED, FOOLISH.

519
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:33,704
THIS CITY HAS A CANCER,

520
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:36,374
THE 1% WHO CONTROL INDUSTRY.

521
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:38,876
I WILL EXCISE IT.

522
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:42,588
OUR SIEGE OF STAR CITY
BEGINS TONIGHT.

523
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:45,507
WILLIAM: THIS MIGHT BE
HOW IT STARTS.

524
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:47,551
THIS IS THE BEGINNING
OF THE FUTURE.

525
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:51,097
WHY WOULD GRANT GIVE
US ADVANCE WARNING?

526
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,057
IT SEEMS TOO EASY.

527
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:54,892
THAT'S BECAUSE IT IS.

528
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:56,518
LOOK. GRANT MAY BE
PLANNING AN ATTACK,

529
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,396
BUT IT WON'T BE
ON THE RICH.

530
00:23:58,436 --> 00:24:00,147
THAT VIDEO'S A MISLEAD.

531
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:03,525
THIS KIND OF DECEPTION IS
A DEATHSTROKE SPECIAL.

532
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:05,069
HOW DO YOU KNOW
THAT?

533
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:06,779
I WAS UNDERCOVER
WITH THEM FOR A WHILE,

534
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,531
A LAST-DITCH ATTEMPT
TO GET THROUGH TO JJ.

535
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:12,826
OK. SO IF THIS IS
A BAIT AND SWITCH,
WHAT'S THE SWITCH?

536
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,287
WHAT DO YOU THINK
GRANT'S PLANNING.

537
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:16,038
SOMETHING
A WHOLE LOT BIGGER.

538
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,998
I JUST DON'T KNOW
WHAT EXACTLY.

539
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,084
EVERYTHING HAPPENING
WITH THE DEATHSTROKES

540
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:21,919
IS DIFFERENT NOW.

541
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:23,461
WELL, I'VE GOT SOME
GOOD NEWS.

542
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:25,505
I MANAGED TO EXTRACT
THE DATA FROM THE DRIVE,

543
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:26,966
BUT, SURPRISE, SURPRISE,
IT'S ENCRYPTED,

544
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,217
AND SINCE I'M NOT
AN EXPERT

545
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:30,386
IN EARLY 21st-CENTURY
DECRYPTION ALGORITHMS,

546
00:24:30,428 --> 00:24:33,764
I'VE CALLED IN
SOMEONE WHO IS...CURTIS.

547
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:35,724
GREAT. NOW WHAT ABOUT
MIA AND LAUREL?

548
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:37,935
WE NEED TO FOCUS
ON TRACKING
DOWN GRANT.

549
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:40,478
FELICITY'S SEARCH
ALGORITHM SHOULD STILL
BE ON THE COMPUTER.

550
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,148
WAY AHEAD OF YOU.

551
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:43,774
WOW. MOM REALLY LIKED
PLAYING FAST AND LOOSE

552
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:45,776
WITH
THE FOURTH AMENDMENT, HUH?

553
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:48,112
YEAH.

554
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:50,114
ANY CHATTER
FROM A.R.G.U.S.?

555
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:52,490
NO. NO, NO, NO.
THEY SAID THEY'LL
KEEP US POSTED.

556
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:57,121
HEY. I SPOKE
TO RENE, BY THE WAY.

557
00:24:57,163 --> 00:24:59,539
WELL, I'M QUITE SURE
HE'S NOT WILLING
TO TALK TO ME.

558
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:03,127
NO, BUT I DO KNOW
SOMEONE WHO IS.

559
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:08,548
[JOHN SIGHS]

560
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,929
ARE YOU AVOIDING HIM?

561
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:15,222
NO.

562
00:25:22,396 --> 00:25:23,897
[SIGHS]

563
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:25,358
MAYBE.

564
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:30,363
I'VE NEVER DEALT
WITH ANYTHING LIKE
THIS BEFORE.

565
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:32,781
MY HEAD IS STILL
SPINNING.

566
00:25:32,823 --> 00:25:35,617
I...I...I WANT
TO BLAME SOMEONE.
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHO.

567
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:40,873
JOHN, WE ALL FAILED
TO SAVE THIS CITY.

568
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:43,417
YEAH, DINAH,
BUT I'M HIS FATHER,

569
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:45,294
SO IT'S ON ME.

570
00:25:45,336 --> 00:25:47,296
SO YOU DID PICK
WHO TO BLAME.

571
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:54,512
ALL THIS TALK
ABOUT JJ GOT ME

572
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:57,848
THINKING ABOUT ANDY,
HOW I FAILED HIM,

573
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:02,353
SO YEAH, THE BLAME IS
DEFINITELY ON ME.

574
00:26:02,395 --> 00:26:05,064
I'M GONNA TELL YOU
THE SAME THING
I TOLD RENE

575
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:08,817
BECAUSE IT'S THE SAME
THING I'VE BEEN
TELLING MYSELF.

576
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:10,903
KNOWING WHAT'S HAPPENED

577
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:15,491
CAN EITHER DESTROY US
OR SAVE US.

578
00:26:15,533 --> 00:26:18,077
WE'VE SEEN OUR WORST.

579
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:20,454
NOW LET'S BE OUR BEST.

580
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:26,626
LAUREL: IN THE FUTURE,
DO THEY STILL USE

581
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:29,255
THE PHRASE
"WILD GOOSE CHASE"?

582
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:30,714
IF YOU'RE BORED,
YOU CAN GO.

583
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:32,132
I DON'T NEED
A BABYSITTER.

584
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:34,718
NO, BUT YOU MIGHT
NEED BACKUP

585
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,929
WHEN YOU TRY AND KILL
GRANT WILSON.

586
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:41,350
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

587
00:26:41,392 --> 00:26:44,228
OH. WELL, CLEARLY
NO ONE HAS INFORMED YOU

588
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,730
THAT I USED TO PLAY
FOR TEAM VILLAIN,

589
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:50,650
AND I CAN SPOT
A MURDEROUS INTENT
A MILLION MILES AWAY.

590
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:53,112
SO WHAT, ARE YOU
GONNA TRY AND TALK
ME OUT OF IT NOW,

591
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:55,155
TELL ME TO LISTEN
TO MY DAD OR...

592
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:59,535
OH, GOD, NO. I WOULD
NEVER TELL ANY ONE
TO LISTEN TO OLIVER QUEEN.

593
00:26:59,577 --> 00:27:01,370
NO OFFENSE,

594
00:27:01,412 --> 00:27:05,165
BUT I'M NOT EXACTLY
A VERY BIG FAN
OF YOUR FATHER'S.

595
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:08,877
HE'S KIND OF A DICK,
BUT YOU ARE A GROWN WOMAN,

596
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:13,466
AND IF YOU WANT TO
KILL THIS GUY,
THEN HAVE AT IT,

597
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:15,926
BUT I JUST WANT TO
KNOW WHY.

598
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:18,845
BECAUSE LOCKING HIM
UP ISN'T GONNA
CHANGE ANYTHING.

599
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:21,265
HE ESCAPES
EVERY TIME.

600
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:23,476
IT'S WHY HE IS
SUCH A CULT HERO

601
00:27:23,517 --> 00:27:25,394
AMONG ALL THE WORST
HERE IN STAR CITY.

602
00:27:25,436 --> 00:27:28,814
-INCLUDING FUTURE JJ.
-EXACTLY.

603
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:31,942
LOOK. GRANT HAS TO DIE
SO ZOE CAN LIVE.

604
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:33,986
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT CHANGING TIMELINES,

605
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:37,197
BUT I AM SOMETHING
OF AN EXPERT ON VENGEANCE,

606
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:40,534
AND GETTING IT,
IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING

607
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:42,786
BUT CAUSE YOU MORE PAIN.

608
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:44,913
SO, WHAT, YOU'RE
AN EXPERT ON TALKING
PEOPLE OUT OF MURDER?

609
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:46,832
KIND OF.

610
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:51,378
I HAD TO WHEN FELICITY
WANTED TO TAKE DOWN
RICARDO DIAZ.

611
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,005
MY MOM TRIED
TO KILL SOMEONE?

612
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:55,549
NO, BECAUSE I TALKED HER
OUT OF IT.

613
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:56,883
AND, LOOK, I GET IT.

614
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:59,052
YOU AND YOUR MOM,
YOU'RE BOTH WOMEN

615
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,929
WHO WON'T ALLOW THEMSELVES
TO BE TALKED OUT OF ANYTHING,

616
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:04,057
AND I APPRECIATE THAT,

617
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:09,855
BUT FELICITY, SHE NEVER
REGRETTED CHANGING
HER APPROACH,

618
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:13,108
SO MAYBE YOU SHOULD TRY DOING
THINGS DIFFERENTLY, TOO.

620
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:28,332
THERE YOU ARE.

621
00:28:28,374 --> 00:28:30,042
MIA'S BACK.

622
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:33,337
YOU CRACK THE DRIVE?

623

CURTIS ALMOST
HAS IT.

624
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,132
GOD, YOU KNOW, IT'S
KIND OF ANNOYING
HOW GOOD HE IS.

625
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:41,554
PLUS HE'S GOT THIS
PERFECT HUSBAND/LIFE,

626
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:44,764
NOT THAT I'M JEALOUS
OR ANYTHING.

627
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:50,396
LET ME KNOW WHEN IT'S
DONE, OK?

628
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:53,273
YOU KNOW, I HAVE BEEN TOLD
BY SEVERAL EX-BOYFRIENDS

629
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:56,235
THAT I DO THIS
MOODY, BROODY THING

630
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:58,778
WHEN I'M PROBLEM-SOLVING.

631
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:01,281
GUESS IT MUST BE
GENETIC.

IT'S MIA, RIGHT?

633
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:05,077
I DIDN'T WANT HER
TO GO OUT THERE.

634
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:06,870
WELL, THEN YOU SHOULD
HAVE MADE HER STAY?

635
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:08,872
WHAT, PUT HER
IN TIMEOUT?
SHE'S AN ADULT.

636
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:10,832
YEAH, AND LIKE AN ADULT,
SHE MAKES MISTAKES.

637
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:13,126
SHE'S RIGHT.

638
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:16,129
I CHOSE TO GO
WITH THE MONITOR.

639
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:18,757
I ABANDONED HER.

640
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:20,092
I HAVEN'T EARNED
A SAY.

641
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:21,009
YEAH, BUT THAT
DOESN'T MEAN

642
00:29:21,051 --> 00:29:23,387
SHE DOESN'T WANT
YOU TO HAVE ONE

643
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:26,348
OR...OR THAT YOU SHOULDN'T,

644
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:30,185
AND I'M SAYING THAT
FROM EXPERIENCE.

645
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:31,687
YOU HAVE KIDS
IN THE FUTURE?

646
00:29:31,729 --> 00:29:33,564
OH, GOD, NO.
I MEAN, DON'T GET ME WRONG.

647
00:29:33,606 --> 00:29:35,608
KIDS ARE A MIRACLE
OR...WHATEVER,

648
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:38,277
BUT I WAS ACTUALLY
REFERRING TO

649
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:41,363
WHEN I LEFT YOU TO GO
LIVE WITH GRANDMA
AND GRANDPA.

650
00:29:41,405 --> 00:29:43,699
YEAH. THAT ONE'S
STILL PRETTY FRESH
FOR ME.

651
00:29:43,741 --> 00:29:45,158
RIGHT.

00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:48,828
I THOUGHT YOU
HATED MY GUTS.

654
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,830
I HATED YOU
FOR ABANDONING ME.

655
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:52,708
-I TRIED.
-TRUE,

656
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:56,086
BUT I WANTED YOU
TO TRY HARDER,

657
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:58,213
PUSH A LITTLE MORE.

658
00:29:58,255 --> 00:30:00,924
I THINK THAT'S ALL
ANY CHILD WANTS
FROM THEIR PARENTS.

659
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:07,973
I'M SORRY.

660
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:10,892
IT'S OK.

661
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:14,104
DAD, I AM GLAD THAT
YOU'RE IN MY LIFE

662
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:18,900
THEN AND NOW,

663
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:20,569
AND MIA WILL BE, TOO.

664
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:26,450
UM, I HATE TO
INTERRUPT FATHER-SON TIME,

665
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:28,994
BUT WE GOT SOMETHING.

666
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:31,497
SO GRANT IS TRYING TO
ONE-UP HIS FATHER.

667
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:33,373
THE SIEGE VERSION 2.0
IS TONIGHT,

668
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:35,000
AND THIS TIME,
MIRAKURU IS OUT,

669
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:36,710
AND COORDINATED
BOMB ATTACKS ARE IN.

670
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:38,878
OLIVER: HOW MANY?
LAUREL: LOTS,

671
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,881
AND GRANT HAS THEM
ALL CONNECTED TO
A REMOTE DETONATOR,

672
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:43,425
PROBABLY A PHONE.

673
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:45,636
THE GOOD NEWS IS...
AND USE THAT TERM

674
00:30:45,678 --> 00:30:49,723
VERY LOOSELY...IS THAT
HE SET UP A RELAY DEVICE
UNDERNEATH DOWNTOWN.

675
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:52,142
SO WE DISABLE
THE RELAY DEVICE,
WE TURN OFF THE BOMB.

676
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:53,477
MIA: OK. WHAT ABOUT GRANT?

677
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:54,978
HE'S HOLED UP
UNDERGROUND,

678
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,730
WHERE THE LINES
CONVERGE
AT WATER STREET.

679
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:58,106
HISTORY REPEATS ITSELF.

680
00:30:58,148 --> 00:30:59,566
WELL, MAYBE WE CAN STOP
THE ATTACK

681
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:01,527
BY RUNNING THE SAME PLAY
WE RAN LAST TIME.

682
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:04,488
RENE: NO. SOMEONE TOLD ME
THE ONLY WAY

683
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:08,659
TO CHANGE THE FUTURE
IS TO START DOING
THINGS DIFFERENTLY NOW.

684
00:31:08,701 --> 00:31:11,328
-RENE, LOOK...
-JOHN, WE'RE GOOD.

685
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:12,538
YOU, TOO, CONNOR.

686
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:14,373
I CAN'T BE MAD
AT EITHER OF YOU
FOR SOMETHING

687
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:17,668
I WILL NEVER
LET HAPPEN.

688
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:20,295
OLIVER: ALL RIGHT.
WE SET UP ONE TEAM
TO GO AFTER GRANT,

689
00:31:20,337 --> 00:31:21,797
ONE TEAM TO DESTROY
THE RELAY DEVICE,

690
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:24,966
BUT WE ALSO NEED TO
KEEP THE PUBLIC
CALM THIS TIME.

691
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:26,552
LAST I CHECKED,
THE POLICE ARE STILL GOOD,

692
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:28,928
AND I'M STILL CAPTAIN,
FUTURE BE DAMNED.

693
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,514

I GOT TO DO SOMETHING

694
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:32,516

FROM THERE.

TO COME WITH US.

DIFFERENTLY THIS TIME.

RIGHTFULLY YOURS.

LEARN THAT?
