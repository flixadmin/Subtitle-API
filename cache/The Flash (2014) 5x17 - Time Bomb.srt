1
00:00:00,508 --> 00:00:01,817
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:01,818 --> 00:00:04,129
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:05,172
To the outside world,

4
00:00:05,173 --> 00:00:07,298
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist.

5
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:10,143
But secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

6
00:00:10,144 --> 00:00:13,156
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

7
00:00:13,157 --> 00:00:15,322
But when my daughter came
back from the future to help,

8
00:00:15,323 --> 00:00:17,749
she changed the present.

9
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:20,329
And now our world is
more dangerous than ever,

10
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:23,031
and I'm the only one
fast enough to save it.

11
00:00:23,032 --> 00:00:25,499
I am the Flash.

12
00:00:26,334 --> 00:00:28,003
Previously on The Flash...

13
00:00:28,023 --> 00:00:30,285
Who is your accomplice, Nora?

14
00:00:30,304 --> 00:00:32,719
The cure's finished, and it works.

15
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,022
- What do you do?
- Trust me.

16
00:00:34,023 --> 00:00:35,656
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

17
00:00:35,691 --> 00:00:36,757
We made an arrangement.

18
00:00:36,792 --> 00:00:38,770
We cure him and then Grace.

19
00:00:38,771 --> 00:00:42,106
That is a new timeline
struggling to break through.

20
00:00:42,141 --> 00:00:43,608
Something big is coming.

21
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:44,642
What's going on?

22
00:00:47,314 --> 00:00:48,686
Please!

23
00:00:48,687 --> 00:00:50,413
If Cicada doesn't exist anymore,

24
00:00:50,414 --> 00:00:51,849
who was that?

25
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:56,220
I've missed you, Uncle Orlin.

26
00:01:01,857 --> 00:01:03,413
Something went wrong.

27
00:01:03,414 --> 00:01:05,393
We got Dwyer. We gave him the cure.

28
00:01:05,394 --> 00:01:06,727
This should all be over.

29
00:01:06,762 --> 00:01:08,729
But another Cicada showed up,

30
00:01:08,764 --> 00:01:12,232
took Dwyer and the dagger.

31
00:01:12,267 --> 00:01:14,368
Thawne! Did you hear what I said?

32
00:01:14,403 --> 00:01:15,970
Another Cicada showed up.

33
00:01:16,005 --> 00:01:17,104
I know.

34
00:01:19,008 --> 00:01:21,174
I know.

35
00:01:22,344 --> 00:01:24,244
Who is that?

36
00:01:24,279 --> 00:01:25,913
I have no idea.

37
00:01:27,817 --> 00:01:31,619
You said manipulating the
timeline would stop Cicada.

38
00:01:31,654 --> 00:01:33,554
You said you knew what you were doing!

39
00:01:33,589 --> 00:01:35,422
I know what I said.

40
00:01:37,226 --> 00:01:38,526
I was very wrong.

41
00:01:40,563 --> 00:01:43,664
What do we do? What do we do now?

42
00:01:43,699 --> 00:01:46,366
I can't help you anymore...

43
00:01:46,402 --> 00:01:48,002
little runner.

44
00:01:48,037 --> 00:01:49,269
What?

45
00:01:49,304 --> 00:01:52,105
You have to help me.

46
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,744
It's too late.

47
00:01:56,779 --> 00:01:58,445
No.

48
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,347
There's gotta be something we can do.

49
00:02:00,382 --> 00:02:03,017
You... you have to help!

50
00:02:03,052 --> 00:02:05,786
There is only one thing left to do.

51
00:02:07,623 --> 00:02:09,189
Tell your father.

52
00:02:13,563 --> 00:02:15,896
You tell your father everything.

53
00:02:18,213 --> 00:02:21,084

-DIFUNDE LA CULTURA-

54
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:35,549
Your lung's healing.

55
00:02:35,585 --> 00:02:36,784
It'll take a while for you to get

56
00:02:36,819 --> 00:02:38,285
the rest of your strength back,

57
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,921
but don't worry.

58
00:02:40,957 --> 00:02:43,423
I'll take care of you.

59
00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:45,158
Like you took care of me.

60
00:02:48,297 --> 00:02:50,030
Who are you?

61
00:03:06,015 --> 00:03:08,716
Grace?

62
00:03:10,252 --> 00:03:12,219
Hi, Uncle Orlin.

63
00:03:12,254 --> 00:03:13,320
But you were...

64
00:03:13,355 --> 00:03:15,689
A ten-year-old girl in a coma?

65
00:03:15,725 --> 00:03:19,192
Eventually, that girl at
the hospital wakes up.

66
00:03:19,228 --> 00:03:21,194
She grows older,

67
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:23,330
and she becomes me.

68
00:03:23,365 --> 00:03:27,935
You're from the future,
like Flash's daughter.

69
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:31,338
I came back here to
work with you again.

70
00:03:31,373 --> 00:03:35,408
And I remember everything
you taught me, Uncle Orlin.

71
00:03:36,445 --> 00:03:38,112
Now, get some rest.

72
00:03:40,683 --> 00:03:42,482
Wait.

73
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:45,753
Where are we?

74
00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:48,956
No one will find you while I'm gone.

75
00:03:48,991 --> 00:03:51,659
There's noodles in the
pantry if you're hungry.

76
00:03:51,694 --> 00:03:53,027
And ice cream.

77
00:03:53,062 --> 00:03:54,728
Where are you going?

78
00:04:01,637 --> 00:04:05,139
To take care of something important.

79
00:04:05,174 --> 00:04:07,074
When I get back...

80
00:04:09,211 --> 00:04:12,846
We're gonna figure out how
you get your powers back.

81
00:04:23,492 --> 00:04:26,060
And Dr. Ambres never talked
about her relationship

82
00:04:26,095 --> 00:04:27,427
with Orlin Dwyer?

83
00:04:27,462 --> 00:04:29,262
She never really talked about anything.

84
00:04:29,298 --> 00:04:31,899
After her fiancé died, she
wasn't quite the same.

85
00:04:31,934 --> 00:04:33,500
How so?

86
00:04:33,535 --> 00:04:35,769
Angry. Withdrawn.

87
00:04:35,805 --> 00:04:37,171
Only time she seemed happy

88
00:04:37,206 --> 00:04:39,006
was when she was with
that girl in the coma.

89
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:42,076
Can you think of anything
that might help us find Dwyer?

90
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,877
I'm sorry, Detective.

91
00:04:47,249 --> 00:04:49,683
Okay, if you come up with anything,

92
00:04:49,719 --> 00:04:52,152
would you give me a call, please?

93
00:04:52,188 --> 00:04:53,620
Thank you.

94
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,924
Somebody's gotta know something.

95
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,693
Everyone we've talked
to is telling the truth.

96
00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:02,295
I think Ambres was the only
one working with Dwyer.

97
00:05:02,331 --> 00:05:04,564
Well, look, we'll pore
over the files at CCPD.

98
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,133
Maybe we missed something.

99
00:05:06,168 --> 00:05:08,468
We'll let you know if we come
up with anything, all right?

100
00:05:12,608 --> 00:05:14,341
You okay?

101
00:05:14,376 --> 00:05:16,877
I just, uh...

102
00:05:16,912 --> 00:05:19,213
don't know what to do.

103
00:05:19,248 --> 00:05:21,014
Yeah, me neither.

104
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:24,151
We've hit walls before, though.

105
00:05:24,186 --> 00:05:26,186
We'll figure it out.

106
00:05:34,015 --> 00:05:36,171
TRANSLATION PROGRESS
ANALYZING...

107
00:05:36,172 --> 00:05:37,762
TRANSLATION PROGRESS
COMPLETE

108
00:05:39,635 --> 00:05:41,668
All right.

109
00:05:41,703 --> 00:05:45,605
Nora West-Allen, let's
see what we have here.

110
00:05:45,641 --> 00:05:47,975
Boring. Boring. Boring.

111
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:50,878
Banality. Boring. Boring.

112
00:05:50,913 --> 00:05:52,946
Come on.

113
00:05:52,982 --> 00:05:56,984
I know you're working with
someone, but no names.

114
00:05:58,854 --> 00:06:00,087
Clever girl.

115
00:06:00,122 --> 00:06:01,721
Hey.

116
00:06:01,757 --> 00:06:03,523
Cortex isn't gonna clean
itself, you know.

117
00:06:08,297 --> 00:06:11,064
Oh, nice table. Liking the new digs.

118
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,800
Well, technically, they're old digs,

119
00:06:12,835 --> 00:06:16,436
but I guess there is an upside
to remodeling after an attack.

120
00:06:16,471 --> 00:06:17,771
Did you guys find anything?

121
00:06:17,807 --> 00:06:19,006
Well, I put out an article,

122
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,507
but none of my readers have seen Dwyer

123
00:06:20,542 --> 00:06:22,109
or this new Cicada.

124
00:06:22,144 --> 00:06:24,044
I talked to Earl Cox, all
my contacts... nothing.

125
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:26,579
How long till the satellite
can scan for dark matter?

126
00:06:26,615 --> 00:06:27,580
How about now?

127
00:06:27,616 --> 00:06:29,382
Well, if this new Cicada

128
00:06:29,418 --> 00:06:31,018
even has traceable dark matter.

129
00:06:31,053 --> 00:06:32,820
I mean, we've seen Cicada
numéro deux do things

130
00:06:32,855 --> 00:06:34,154
that we've not seen before, right?

131
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,856
Yeah, I mean, he can dampen powers,

132
00:06:35,891 --> 00:06:38,025
he can control the
dagger just like Dwyer,

133
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,427
but it's... I don't
know, it's also like...

134
00:06:40,462 --> 00:06:42,595
Like he could take control of us.

135
00:06:42,631 --> 00:06:44,164
Let's hope Caitlin can figure that out

136
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,799
at the Tannhauser site

137
00:06:45,835 --> 00:06:47,600
while we figure out where he is.

138
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:49,269
STARCHIVES ASSET
#11578 DETECTED

139
00:06:52,107 --> 00:06:54,174
We got a Starchives
asset in Kolins Woods.

140
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:55,775
Starchives? What is this?

141
00:06:55,811 --> 00:06:57,277
Well, it's a place where we house

142
00:06:57,313 --> 00:06:59,479
everything Flash related...
prototypes, super suits...

143
00:06:59,514 --> 00:07:01,048
I mean, everything since day one.

144
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,716
Okay, and the alarm
is going off because...

145
00:07:02,751 --> 00:07:05,919
Because somebody just
stole something from us.

146
00:07:05,955 --> 00:07:09,857
Something really, really, not good.

147
00:07:16,131 --> 00:07:17,430
You guys at the Starchives yet?

148
00:07:17,466 --> 00:07:18,698
We just got here.

149
00:07:18,734 --> 00:07:20,234
No sign of forced entry.

150
00:07:20,269 --> 00:07:21,935
Or overhead lighting, apparently.

151
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:24,571
Pretty sure that's a vacuum.

152
00:07:24,606 --> 00:07:26,874
Okay, keep looking!

153
00:07:26,909 --> 00:07:28,842
Remind me again what we're looking for?

154
00:07:28,878 --> 00:07:34,681
Uh, it's like a huge
round glass bubble.

155
00:07:34,716 --> 00:07:36,583
You mean like that?

156
00:07:39,554 --> 00:07:39,874
Yeah.

157
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:41,125
- We found it!
- We found it!

158
00:07:41,225 --> 00:07:42,756
Thawne's Time Sphere? Are you sure?

159
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:44,391
What do you mean "am I sure?"

160
00:07:44,426 --> 00:07:46,760
- Pretty sure.
- I'm looking right at it, why?

161
00:07:49,131 --> 00:07:51,498
'Cause we're looking right at it too.

162
00:07:55,971 --> 00:07:58,872
So it's here and in the Starchives

163
00:07:58,908 --> 00:08:00,774
at the same time?

164
00:08:00,809 --> 00:08:02,876
Somebody stole the plans
and made a duplicate?

165
00:08:02,912 --> 00:08:04,477
Not exactly.

166
00:08:04,513 --> 00:08:08,615
Guys, cue up Operation: Shazam.

167
00:08:10,752 --> 00:08:11,718
Ready.

168
00:08:17,927 --> 00:08:20,760
One scratch on two
different Time Spheres.

169
00:08:20,796 --> 00:08:23,263
Or one scratch on one Time Sphere.

170
00:08:23,299 --> 00:08:26,266
That's impossible... unless...

171
00:08:26,302 --> 00:08:27,500
Unless it's the same one.

172
00:08:27,536 --> 00:08:29,636
It is the same one.

173
00:08:29,671 --> 00:08:31,271
This is our Time Sphere.

174
00:08:31,307 --> 00:08:33,140
Which shows up here at the same time

175
00:08:33,175 --> 00:08:36,310
that someone who looks like
Cicada kidnaps Orlin Dwyer.

176
00:08:36,345 --> 00:08:38,111
It's not a coincidence.

177
00:08:38,147 --> 00:08:39,346
So whoever kidnapped Dwyer...

178
00:08:39,381 --> 00:08:41,315
Is the Cicada from the future.

179
00:08:43,199 --> 00:08:45,764
CENTRAL CITY POLICE

180
00:09:19,721 --> 00:09:21,188
You move, I shoot.

181
00:09:36,405 --> 00:09:38,905
That was dumb.

182
00:10:04,318 --> 00:10:05,584
It was him, wasn't it?

183
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:06,975
The other Cicada.

184
00:10:06,976 --> 00:10:09,075
Guy didn't know what hit him.

185
00:10:09,111 --> 00:10:10,944
You said he was after a cold case file?

186
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,880
- Are any of them digitized?
- Not yet.

187
00:10:12,915 --> 00:10:15,315
But the only way to
figure out what's missing

188
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:17,484
is to see what's still here.

189
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,852
I mean...

190
00:10:18,888 --> 00:10:21,955
I could help with that.

191
00:10:21,991 --> 00:10:24,024
All right, everybody. Clear out.

192
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:25,392
CSI needs this scene.

193
00:10:27,897 --> 00:10:28,962
Hey, by the way,

194
00:10:28,998 --> 00:10:30,564
this might not be our only lead.

195
00:10:30,599 --> 00:10:32,633
Do you remember that Time Sphere

196
00:10:32,668 --> 00:10:33,934
that we built for Thawne?

197
00:10:33,969 --> 00:10:35,669
That big hamster ball thing?

198
00:10:35,704 --> 00:10:38,371
Someone stole one in
the future to come here.

199
00:10:38,407 --> 00:10:41,241
For what, our... our Cicada copycat?

200
00:10:41,276 --> 00:10:43,276
It makes sense.

201
00:10:43,311 --> 00:10:46,046
I can't even believe I just said that.

202
00:10:46,081 --> 00:10:47,113
Okay, son, you're on.

203
00:10:47,149 --> 00:10:48,248
Yup.

204
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:52,485
Okay, I went through everything.

205
00:10:52,521 --> 00:10:54,721
There was indeed one file missing.

206
00:10:54,757 --> 00:10:59,993
And it's... thank you... it is from 2017.

207
00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:01,227
That's it.

208
00:11:01,263 --> 00:11:02,529
All right, I'll do some digging,

209
00:11:02,565 --> 00:11:03,864
see why this was so important,

210
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:05,532
they had to cut a hole in the wall.

211
00:11:05,568 --> 00:11:07,668
- I'll help.
- Yeah.

212
00:11:12,975 --> 00:11:14,841
Are you sure you want to do this?

213
00:11:14,877 --> 00:11:17,343
I mean, this is a big deal.

214
00:11:17,379 --> 00:11:21,048
Like, "not Penny's boat"
kind of big deal.

215
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,320
Okay.

216
00:11:27,355 --> 00:11:30,857
Kamilla Hwang, you and
I are officially...

217
00:11:30,893 --> 00:11:33,060
"In a Relationship."

218
00:11:33,095 --> 00:11:34,861
- Social media official!
- What!

219
00:11:34,897 --> 00:11:37,030
Yeah.

220
00:11:37,066 --> 00:11:38,565
Larry, my usual.

221
00:11:38,601 --> 00:11:40,701
It's Jason.

222
00:11:40,736 --> 00:11:43,637
Ralph! What's, um...

223
00:11:43,672 --> 00:11:44,905
what are you doing here?

224
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,506
Same as you... taking a break

225
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:47,741
from saving the old world.

226
00:11:47,776 --> 00:11:49,876
- Um...
- Look at you two.

227
00:11:49,912 --> 00:11:51,845
Young love.

228
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,581
So, uh, K-Dawg, when you
gonna meet the group?

229
00:11:54,617 --> 00:11:56,449
Uh, the group?

230
00:11:56,485 --> 00:11:58,952
Yeah, the squad, the team. The gang.

231
00:11:58,988 --> 00:12:01,254
Uh, hey, we're actually in
the middle of a date here.

232
00:12:01,289 --> 00:12:02,956
Actually, we're at the
end of a date, babe.

233
00:12:02,992 --> 00:12:04,725
- I have that gig.
- Oh, right.

234
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,126
Your Easter thing. You have to go.

235
00:12:06,161 --> 00:12:08,028
- She has to go.
- Oh, uh, Cisco?

236
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:10,697
I'm supposed to tell you that
Barry wanted to talk to you.

237
00:12:12,801 --> 00:12:14,200
Probably could've texted that.

238
00:12:14,236 --> 00:12:16,069
Yeah, probably.

239
00:12:17,272 --> 00:12:18,505
Okay, well, Easter Bunny photos

240
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,873
aren't gonna take themselves.

241
00:12:19,908 --> 00:12:21,374
It's kind of a bottom-of-the-barrel

242
00:12:21,409 --> 00:12:22,475
photography gig,

243
00:12:22,511 --> 00:12:23,777
but gotta start somewhere, right?

244
00:12:23,812 --> 00:12:25,145
- Totally.
- Anywhere but here.

245
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,514
- Why don't I walk you out?
- Oh, okay.

246
00:12:39,094 --> 00:12:40,260
Damn it, Larry!

247
00:12:40,295 --> 00:12:43,096
Still Jason!

248
00:12:46,835 --> 00:12:49,703
Voilà, voilà, voilà.

249
00:12:49,738 --> 00:12:52,005
Let's see what we have here.

250
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,909
Thawne's Time Sphere.

251
00:12:55,944 --> 00:12:59,146
What are you doing, Sherloque?

252
00:13:00,248 --> 00:13:02,749
Well, I'm pursuing a new lead

253
00:13:02,785 --> 00:13:04,785
to identify the mystery Cicada.

254
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,286
Well, if you needed information

255
00:13:06,321 --> 00:13:08,121
about the Time Sphere,
you could've just asked.

256
00:13:08,157 --> 00:13:11,725
That's right, but
memory can be deceiving.

257
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,028
Especially for a regular human.

258
00:13:15,064 --> 00:13:18,999
No, I prefer a primary source.

259
00:13:19,034 --> 00:13:20,167
And this new lead,

260
00:13:20,202 --> 00:13:22,335
were you pursuing it last night too?

261
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:24,971
- That's right.
- And all last weekend?

262
00:13:25,007 --> 00:13:26,173
That's right.

263
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:29,109
I am working very hard to get...

264
00:13:29,144 --> 00:13:30,844
to get what I want.

265
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:46,020
THE TIMELINE IS MALLEABLE

266
00:13:48,663 --> 00:13:51,297
Joe traced the file
that our new Cicada took.

267
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:53,100
There was a meta attack
here two years ago.

268
00:13:53,135 --> 00:13:55,235
Two people died, and the
meta was never ID'd.

269
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:57,637
So this new Cicada might
be going after this meta?

270
00:13:57,672 --> 00:13:59,706
- Well...
- Okay.

271
00:13:59,742 --> 00:14:01,007
What do I vibe?

272
00:14:01,043 --> 00:14:02,743
Well, we're not exactly sure.

273
00:14:02,778 --> 00:14:04,878
All the street cameras were
destroyed by the explosion.

274
00:14:04,913 --> 00:14:08,481
The original ATM was too
fried to recover any data.

275
00:14:08,516 --> 00:14:10,350
- For real?
- Yeah.

276
00:14:10,385 --> 00:14:11,818
Well, I'm out.

277
00:14:11,854 --> 00:14:14,621
I can't vibe a crime scene
that does not exist.

278
00:14:14,656 --> 00:14:16,256
Literally does not exist.

279
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:19,926
I mean, even this ATM is,
like, brand-spanking-new.

280
00:14:19,962 --> 00:14:22,328
But this concrete isn't.

281
00:14:22,364 --> 00:14:23,930
It still has scorch marks on it.

282
00:14:23,966 --> 00:14:25,365
Hold this.

283
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:37,577
Sweetie! You forgot your ATM card.

284
00:14:46,922 --> 00:14:48,288
What'd you see?

285
00:14:48,323 --> 00:14:49,990
The victims.

286
00:14:51,927 --> 00:14:53,894
They were Grace Gibbons' parents.

287
00:14:56,198 --> 00:14:59,532
In Grace's mindscape, she
saw herself as Cicada.

288
00:14:59,567 --> 00:15:03,170
And another Cicada shows up
targeting her parents' killer.

289
00:15:03,205 --> 00:15:04,437
It has to be her.

290
00:15:04,472 --> 00:15:07,073
The new Cicada is Grace Gibbons.

291
00:15:07,109 --> 00:15:08,308
From the future.

292
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,180
Time travel sucks.

293
00:15:23,591 --> 00:15:24,925
Grace, what's wrong?

294
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:29,930
Look at this.

295
00:15:34,236 --> 00:15:36,036
It's your parents' murder file?

296
00:15:36,071 --> 00:15:38,905
Do you see what they did?

297
00:15:38,941 --> 00:15:39,873
Nothing!

298
00:15:39,908 --> 00:15:41,607
Three witnesses saw a woman

299
00:15:41,643 --> 00:15:44,010
in a hoodie leave the scene,
but did Central City's finest

300
00:15:44,046 --> 00:15:46,246
put out a search party or an APB?

301
00:15:46,281 --> 00:15:49,850
No. They thought it sounded
like a job for the Flash.

302
00:15:50,812 --> 00:15:52,686
EVIDENCE

303
00:15:52,687 --> 00:15:54,955
Look at this debris from the scene.

304
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:58,291
Looks like a chemical burn.

305
00:15:58,327 --> 00:16:00,827
It's not a chemical burn.

306
00:16:00,863 --> 00:16:04,564
It's charred dark matter residue.

307
00:16:04,599 --> 00:16:07,033
We can track the meta who left it.

308
00:16:07,069 --> 00:16:08,835
How?

309
00:16:08,871 --> 00:16:12,038
I can't track an exact
real time location,

310
00:16:12,074 --> 00:16:13,406
but I can get close.

311
00:16:17,312 --> 00:16:19,246
Found her.

312
00:16:23,485 --> 00:16:27,787
Grace, what are you doing?

313
00:16:27,822 --> 00:16:30,056
In the time I'm from,
their plague spreads

314
00:16:30,092 --> 00:16:33,226
across the world, unchecked, unabated.

315
00:16:33,262 --> 00:16:35,762
But now that I'm here with you,

316
00:16:35,797 --> 00:16:37,964
we can change that.

317
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,400
And the mission can succeed.

318
00:16:40,435 --> 00:16:42,102
What mission?

319
00:16:42,137 --> 00:16:43,636
Ours.

320
00:16:43,671 --> 00:16:46,206
To kill every last meta-human.

321
00:16:47,576 --> 00:16:51,044
Starting with the rat bastard
who killed my parents.

322
00:17:03,572 --> 00:17:06,007
So, Cicada II is really
Grace from the future,

323
00:17:06,042 --> 00:17:07,941
and she's trying to get
revenge on the meta

324
00:17:07,977 --> 00:17:10,444
that murdered her parents and
that killer meta is here?

325
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,481
Cisco saw the last PIN that
was entered into the ATM.

326
00:17:13,516 --> 00:17:15,316
The card belongs to
Vickie and John Bolen.

327
00:17:15,351 --> 00:17:16,950
We already went by their house,

328
00:17:16,986 --> 00:17:18,886
and a neighbor said they
were having a party here.

329
00:17:18,921 --> 00:17:20,587
Um, I think this is them.

330
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:22,189
Excuse me, sir?

331
00:17:22,225 --> 00:17:24,758
Detective Joe West, we're from CCPD.

332
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:27,028
Are you Mr. John Bolen?

333
00:17:27,063 --> 00:17:28,729
I am. How can I help you?

334
00:17:28,764 --> 00:17:29,763
What's going on? Oh.

335
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:30,931
Sorry to be rude,

336
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:32,466
but we're in the middle of a party.

337
00:17:32,502 --> 00:17:34,635
This won't take long. Um...

338
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:38,339
Do you remember using an
ATM on Kingswell and 42nd

339
00:17:38,374 --> 00:17:40,541
around May 4th, 2017?

340
00:17:40,576 --> 00:17:42,143
There was an explosion that day.

341
00:17:42,178 --> 00:17:44,811
We think a meta-human
might have been involved.

342
00:17:44,847 --> 00:17:46,747
Hon, why don't you and
Alice start gathering

343
00:17:46,782 --> 00:17:48,015
the kids for a team photo?

344
00:17:48,051 --> 00:17:51,652
I'll talk to the nice officers.

345
00:17:51,687 --> 00:17:53,421
Okay.

346
00:17:55,124 --> 00:17:56,857
I can't believe you found
me after all this time.

347
00:17:56,892 --> 00:17:59,960
We'd just like to know
what happened that day.

348
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:01,662
Did you blow up that ATM?

349
00:18:01,697 --> 00:18:03,464
I-it all happened so fast.

350
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:04,932
I touched the machine,

351
00:18:04,967 --> 00:18:07,000
and it was like something
turned on in me.

352
00:18:07,036 --> 00:18:09,803
You hyper-accelerated
the molecules in the ATM,

353
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:12,139
causing a violent chain reaction.

354
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:14,241
I just know I saw sparks and ran.

355
00:18:14,277 --> 00:18:15,476
Then I heard this explosion

356
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,311
and money was flying everywhere.

357
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,480
It looked like I was
trying to rob the bank.

358
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:22,550
I was too afraid to go back.

359
00:18:22,585 --> 00:18:23,951
At least no one got hurt.

360
00:18:25,421 --> 00:18:28,155
Mrs. Bolen, we have reason to believe

361
00:18:28,191 --> 00:18:30,291
a killer is targeting you.

362
00:18:30,326 --> 00:18:31,825
Why?

363
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,595
It's because of your... abilities.

364
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:37,331
Listen, we'd like to put
you in federal protection

365
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,699
to keep your family safe.

366
00:18:38,734 --> 00:18:40,367
And what would I tell my husband?

367
00:18:40,403 --> 00:18:41,635
Or my daughter?

368
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,137
"Hey, sorry, Mommy has powers."

369
00:18:43,172 --> 00:18:44,738
We all have to leave our lives behind.

370
00:18:44,773 --> 00:18:47,408
They don't know about your powers?

371
00:18:47,443 --> 00:18:49,510
Of course not. No one does.

372
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,078
You think I'm proud of this?

373
00:18:51,114 --> 00:18:53,247
I think they have a
right to know the truth.

374
00:18:53,282 --> 00:18:54,548
They're your family.

375
00:18:55,918 --> 00:18:57,451
And who the hell do you think you are,

376
00:18:57,487 --> 00:18:58,652
telling me what to do?

377
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:00,654
We're not going anywhere.

378
00:19:00,689 --> 00:19:02,756
That's final.

379
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:04,091
Please leave.

380
00:19:07,029 --> 00:19:10,864
She's not safe. We're staying put.

381
00:19:15,871 --> 00:19:17,471
I got your text. What's the emergency?

382
00:19:17,507 --> 00:19:19,240
Okay. Listen to me very carefully.

383
00:19:19,275 --> 00:19:22,143
I took a break from serial
killer kidnapper madness

384
00:19:22,178 --> 00:19:24,345
to do something awesome.

385
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,480
So I decided on a new career path.

386
00:19:26,516 --> 00:19:28,048
Photography was always my passion,

387
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,450
and I figured why not make it my job?

388
00:19:29,485 --> 00:19:31,018
These are great, Kamilla.

389
00:19:31,053 --> 00:19:32,919
I Peter Parker'd her.

390
00:19:32,955 --> 00:19:34,455
Dibs, sidebar.

391
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:35,589
Sidebar?

392
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:37,158
Sidebar, now!

393
00:19:39,262 --> 00:19:43,197
You have, uh... Peter Parker'd her.

394
00:19:43,232 --> 00:19:45,699
Yeah, I mean, Kamilla
is a great photographer

395
00:19:45,734 --> 00:19:48,302
and I thought she could start
taking some pictures for Iris,

396
00:19:48,337 --> 00:19:50,504
and then maybe she'd start to
come around S.T.A.R. Labs.

397
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,039
I don't know, if we're lucky, get bitten

398
00:19:52,074 --> 00:19:53,974
by something radioactive.

399
00:19:54,009 --> 00:19:55,676
Become, like, a Spider-Person.

400
00:19:55,711 --> 00:19:57,778
So, while you thought,
did it occur to you

401
00:19:57,813 --> 00:20:00,514
that no one asked you to do this?

402
00:20:01,917 --> 00:20:05,686
You don't think she'd
make a good Spider-Person?

403
00:20:05,721 --> 00:20:07,188
You listen to me and you listen good,

404
00:20:07,223 --> 00:20:08,389
you turkey on stilts.

405
00:20:08,424 --> 00:20:10,057
It is not your job

406
00:20:10,092 --> 00:20:12,726
to get my girlfriend on the team!

407
00:20:12,761 --> 00:20:15,162
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, you two!

408
00:20:15,198 --> 00:20:17,298
You guys are getting along
in there, I see that.

409
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:18,965
What's going on?

410
00:20:19,001 --> 00:20:20,334
Your friend Iris was actually

411
00:20:20,369 --> 00:20:21,968
just giving me a photography gig.

412
00:20:22,004 --> 00:20:25,105
Well, it's small, but
Kamilla has agreed to shoot

413
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:28,242
the Fairway parade for the
"Citizen" this weekend.

414
00:20:28,277 --> 00:20:30,244
Shut the front door.

415
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:33,080
That is unbelievable.

416
00:20:33,115 --> 00:20:34,815
Congrats. That's amazing.

417
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:37,384
Hey, why don't you and I go,
uh, drink and celebrate?

418
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:39,687
Oh, sure. Um, I will text you later.

419
00:20:39,722 --> 00:20:41,154
Yes, that sounds great. Thank you.

420
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,889
- You ready?
- Yeah.

421
00:20:46,429 --> 00:20:49,196
Well, well, well.

422
00:20:49,232 --> 00:20:53,634
Bonjour, Eobard Thawne.

423
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:56,136
If I am Eobard Thawne,

424
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:59,906
what kind of man am I?

425
00:20:59,942 --> 00:21:02,075
Patient, right?

426
00:21:02,111 --> 00:21:04,111
Master of science.

427
00:21:04,146 --> 00:21:06,447
But also...

428
00:21:08,917 --> 00:21:10,884
A master of...

429
00:21:13,489 --> 00:21:14,921
Subterfuge.

430
00:21:14,957 --> 00:21:18,525
Because not only...

431
00:21:18,561 --> 00:21:20,227
am I...

432
00:21:20,263 --> 00:21:22,496
Eobard Thawne,

433
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:26,099
but I'm also...

434
00:21:28,471 --> 00:21:31,405
Dr. Harrison Wells.

435
00:21:32,808 --> 00:21:35,643
And that man...

436
00:21:35,678 --> 00:21:39,179
that man would keep his secrets...

437
00:21:42,451 --> 00:21:43,984
...close.

438
00:21:45,655 --> 00:21:47,755
What have we here?

439
00:21:50,826 --> 00:21:53,460
Well, well, well.

440
00:21:53,496 --> 00:21:56,163
Bonjour.

441
00:21:56,198 --> 00:21:59,566
How could Vickie not know
she killed two people?

442
00:21:59,602 --> 00:22:01,702
There was a time in Central City

443
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,837
where not all meta attacks
were public knowledge.

444
00:22:03,872 --> 00:22:05,806
Why not? I mean, people should know...

445
00:22:05,841 --> 00:22:08,141
Former Mayor Bellows...

446
00:22:08,177 --> 00:22:10,143
...tried to keep certain
things out of the media.

447
00:22:10,179 --> 00:22:12,245
Said he didn't want to create a panic.

448
00:22:12,281 --> 00:22:14,548
Turns out he had metas on the payroll.

449
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:15,849
Didn't want the heat.

450
00:22:15,884 --> 00:22:17,584
That's Cecile. I'll be right back.

451
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:18,719
Hey.

452
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,024
You were wrong, you know.

453
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:25,292
About what?

454
00:22:25,328 --> 00:22:27,093
About Vickie not wanting
to tell her family

455
00:22:27,129 --> 00:22:28,595
about her abilities.

456
00:22:28,631 --> 00:22:30,163
It's her choice not to tell them.

457
00:22:31,534 --> 00:22:33,767
Look, keeping a secret like that

458
00:22:33,803 --> 00:22:36,203
from her family is... it's dangerous.

459
00:22:36,238 --> 00:22:38,572
I mean, they might get hurt or worse.

460
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,240
She's just trying to protect them.

461
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:43,711
I get that, I do, but...

462
00:22:43,746 --> 00:22:46,547
I-I used to think that
keeping secrets from people

463
00:22:46,582 --> 00:22:49,049
for their own good was a noble decision,

464
00:22:49,084 --> 00:22:51,385
that it would protect them.

465
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,286
But when you do that, you
just rob those people

466
00:22:53,322 --> 00:22:55,922
from making their own decisions.

467
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:58,925
I even did it with you.

468
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:01,027
Like when you didn't want
to take me to your past.

469
00:23:01,063 --> 00:23:02,629
Mm-hmm.

470
00:23:02,665 --> 00:23:03,997
I didn't want you to see how painful

471
00:23:04,032 --> 00:23:05,366
things got for me as the Flash

472
00:23:05,401 --> 00:23:08,168
or how bad things got for your mom.

473
00:23:08,203 --> 00:23:11,739
But secrets are like walls, and...

474
00:23:11,774 --> 00:23:14,074
you can't really know someone
with walls between you.

475
00:23:15,711 --> 00:23:18,245
Ah!

476
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,313
Hey! -

477
00:23:26,188 --> 00:23:27,788
Hey. Are you okay?

478
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:30,624
I must have connected to Grace's mind.

479
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:31,958
She's coming.

480
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:33,293
Grace is coming.

481
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:38,231
I don't see Cicada anywhere. Do you?

482
00:23:38,267 --> 00:23:40,033
It's the Flash!

483
00:23:40,068 --> 00:23:44,137
Mom, you got Flash and XS
cosplayers for the party?

484
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:49,175
Yes, I am the Flash! And I love...

485
00:23:49,211 --> 00:23:51,144
Soccer, do you guys love soccer?

486
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:53,213
Do you want to... yeah, or... awesome!

487
00:23:53,248 --> 00:23:54,581
Come with me!

488
00:23:54,617 --> 00:23:56,049
Here, let's play some soccer over here.

489
00:23:56,084 --> 00:23:57,885
This way. This way. Come
on, come on, come on.

490
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,319
Help me with the kids. Come on, come on!

491
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:01,121
Far away from there.

492
00:24:01,156 --> 00:24:03,023
- What's going on?
- Cicada is coming here.

493
00:24:03,058 --> 00:24:04,558
- What?
- Now.

494
00:24:04,593 --> 00:24:06,126
We can move everyone else out of here,

495
00:24:06,161 --> 00:24:08,094
but you and your family
have to come with me.

496
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:09,463
All right.

497
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,774
- Murderer.
- Grace, stop.

498
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:22,208
She's innocent. It was an accident.

499
00:24:22,244 --> 00:24:24,711
There are no accidents, Nora.

500
00:24:30,853 --> 00:24:31,985
Vickie?

501
00:24:33,422 --> 00:24:34,988
- We have to help Mom.
- Alice!

502
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,927
Alice, no! -

503
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,768
Alice!

504
00:24:47,803 --> 00:24:49,937
My speed's back.

505
00:24:49,972 --> 00:24:51,672
We need to get them out of here.

506
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:03,450
I'll find you.

507
00:25:07,561 --> 00:25:08,694
I can't believe

508
00:25:08,729 --> 00:25:10,196
that little girl in there

509
00:25:10,231 --> 00:25:13,132
grows up to be a
time-traveling serial killer.

510
00:25:13,167 --> 00:25:15,334
Why can't we just
wake her up right now?

511
00:25:15,369 --> 00:25:17,769
We tried before. It didn't work.

512
00:25:17,805 --> 00:25:19,438
What about the meta
cure y'all cooked up?

513
00:25:19,473 --> 00:25:21,106
We'd need Grace's consent.

514
00:25:21,142 --> 00:25:23,408
Besides, Caitlin says that her condition

515
00:25:23,444 --> 00:25:24,977
is too fragile to even try.

516
00:25:25,012 --> 00:25:26,712
And I'm assuming that destroying

517
00:25:26,747 --> 00:25:28,613
the time-traveling hamster ball,

518
00:25:28,649 --> 00:25:30,115
that messes up the timeline?

519
00:25:30,151 --> 00:25:32,617
Yeah, it would probably
just make things even worse.

520
00:25:32,653 --> 00:25:34,419
- Oh, God!
- Whoa, what's wrong?

521
00:25:34,455 --> 00:25:36,021
Her mind.

522
00:25:36,057 --> 00:25:37,489
It's exactly the same as the Cicada

523
00:25:37,524 --> 00:25:39,024
that attacked us at S.T.A.R. Labs.

524
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:42,962
Oh, my God, it's filled
with nothing but hatred.

525
00:25:42,997 --> 00:25:45,597
Nora found out when she
went into Grace's mind

526
00:25:45,632 --> 00:25:48,800
that Grace could hear
Dwyer, even in her coma...

527
00:25:48,836 --> 00:25:51,237
his anger, his rage.

528
00:25:51,272 --> 00:25:52,838
She was listening.

529
00:25:52,874 --> 00:25:54,406
She can carry out his words.

530
00:25:54,441 --> 00:25:56,041
Uh, hey, guys.

531
00:25:56,077 --> 00:25:58,344
Uh, Alice is back from
the OR and she's okay,

532
00:25:58,379 --> 00:26:01,080
but her parents are really not.

533
00:26:01,115 --> 00:26:04,083
Vickie, I asked you to leave!

534
00:26:04,118 --> 00:26:05,617
She's my daughter.

535
00:26:05,652 --> 00:26:08,587
No. I want my dad.

536
00:26:08,622 --> 00:26:10,389
Can't you see that
she's terrified of you?

537
00:26:10,424 --> 00:26:11,957
She could've been killed!

538
00:26:11,993 --> 00:26:13,558
I was trying to protect you guys.

539
00:26:13,594 --> 00:26:15,394
By lying? You're a meta, Vickie!

540
00:26:15,429 --> 00:26:17,963
A human time bomb! How do
you keep that from us?

541
00:26:17,999 --> 00:26:20,532
Mr. Bolen... let's take a breath.

542
00:26:20,567 --> 00:26:22,101
Let's step outside.

543
00:26:36,517 --> 00:26:38,817
Hey, we did the right thing.

544
00:26:38,852 --> 00:26:41,186
We kept this family safe.

545
00:26:41,222 --> 00:26:42,487
Then why does it feel like

546
00:26:42,523 --> 00:26:46,158
we made everything so much worse?

547
00:27:01,008 --> 00:27:02,341
Need any help with that, uh...

548
00:27:02,376 --> 00:27:03,675
Nope.

549
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:05,277
Unless you came here to break something,

550
00:27:05,313 --> 00:27:08,948
in which case you'd be
the perfect candidate.

551
00:27:12,954 --> 00:27:14,320
I deserve that.

552
00:27:14,355 --> 00:27:17,889
Never should've interfered with Kamilla.

553
00:27:17,925 --> 00:27:20,492
Sometimes, I forget how...

554
00:27:20,527 --> 00:27:22,561
embarrassing I can be.

555
00:27:22,596 --> 00:27:25,097
I'm not embarrassed by
you, and I'm not embarrassed

556
00:27:25,132 --> 00:27:26,631
by anyone on Team Flash.

557
00:27:26,667 --> 00:27:28,633
You guys are my family.
You're not the problem.

558
00:27:28,669 --> 00:27:32,438
This is the problem. This is the problem.

559
00:27:34,541 --> 00:27:38,077
Kamilla is blissfully unaware

560
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:41,146
of any of the madness that
goes on in S.T.A.R. Labs,

561
00:27:41,182 --> 00:27:44,649
or that we routinely save
the city from evil metas.

562
00:27:44,685 --> 00:27:46,218
Or that you have a secret identity

563
00:27:46,253 --> 00:27:49,588
and dress up in leather
and go all pew-pew!

564
00:27:49,623 --> 00:27:52,191
Especially the leather.

565
00:27:52,226 --> 00:27:54,326
She and I, we got a good thing.

566
00:27:54,362 --> 00:27:58,964
And being with somebody
has never felt so...

567
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,699
so easy.

568
00:28:00,734 --> 00:28:02,468
And when I'm with her, for once,

569
00:28:02,503 --> 00:28:05,070
I just feel like a normal dude,

570
00:28:05,106 --> 00:28:06,438
with a normal life

571
00:28:06,474 --> 00:28:08,907
and a social-media-official girlfriend,

572
00:28:08,942 --> 00:28:11,977
who happens to be a very
talented photographer

573
00:28:12,013 --> 00:28:15,914
and not... a Spider-Person.

574
00:28:19,987 --> 00:28:24,490
It's... that's amazing, man.
It really is.

575
00:28:24,525 --> 00:28:27,959
And I promise that I will respect that.

576
00:28:29,596 --> 00:28:31,696
But I gotta ask, how long do you think

577
00:28:31,732 --> 00:28:35,367
you can keep those two worlds separate?

578
00:28:35,403 --> 00:28:38,337
Look... my mom dated this guy, Craig,

579
00:28:38,372 --> 00:28:42,007
and Craig was a tax accountant
and a freelance bull rider.

580
00:28:42,043 --> 00:28:43,942
Never let one world know about the other,

581
00:28:43,977 --> 00:28:46,845
and... it just tore him up.

582
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,547
More than those bulls ever did.

583
00:28:48,582 --> 00:28:51,083
Mm. I should definitely be working.

584
00:28:51,118 --> 00:28:53,285
Look, the thing is, I
get why you're afraid

585
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,220
of losing what you have with Kamilla,

586
00:28:55,256 --> 00:28:58,490
but if you keep her out of this world...

587
00:28:58,526 --> 00:28:59,958
it seems to me that you're always

588
00:28:59,993 --> 00:29:03,662
gonna be turning off a part of yourself.

589
00:29:03,697 --> 00:29:05,597
That's not right.

590
00:29:05,632 --> 00:29:07,066
And if Craig hadn't been crushed to death

591
00:29:07,101 --> 00:29:10,001
by that huge filing cabinet...

592
00:29:10,037 --> 00:29:12,237
I know he'd feel the same way.

593
00:29:29,723 --> 00:29:31,656
I didn't get her.

594
00:29:35,396 --> 00:29:37,296
Well, maybe that's a good thing,

595
00:29:37,331 --> 00:29:41,666
'cause I've read this file
and it doesn't make sense.

596
00:29:41,702 --> 00:29:46,472
Grace, there was no money
taken from the crime scene.

597
00:29:46,507 --> 00:29:49,241
I think what happened to your mom and dad

598
00:29:49,276 --> 00:29:50,875
might've been an accident.

599
00:29:50,911 --> 00:29:53,678
She killed my parents, Uncle Orlin!

600
00:29:53,714 --> 00:29:56,081
It wasn't an accident!

601
00:29:56,117 --> 00:29:58,383
You sound like them.

602
00:29:58,419 --> 00:30:01,620
Why do you sound like them?

603
00:30:01,655 --> 00:30:03,455
Grace, your head.

604
00:30:03,491 --> 00:30:05,324
We gotta get you to Dr. Ambres.

605
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:06,891
She'll know how to help.

606
00:30:06,927 --> 00:30:10,596
She's not helping anyone. Not anymore.

607
00:30:10,631 --> 00:30:13,999
Why not?

608
00:30:14,034 --> 00:30:16,034
I killed her.

609
00:30:16,069 --> 00:30:18,437
But Dr. Ambres saved your life.

610
00:30:18,472 --> 00:30:20,071
And destroyed yours.

611
00:30:20,107 --> 00:30:21,773
You had a gift.

612
00:30:21,808 --> 00:30:26,545
An unbreakable weapon that fell
from the sky for you to use.

613
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,680
For you to control.

614
00:30:28,715 --> 00:30:32,484
And she took that power away from you.

615
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,253
No, Grace.

616
00:30:34,288 --> 00:30:36,221
I wanted that cure.

617
00:30:36,257 --> 00:30:38,290
And I wanted you to have it too.

618
00:30:38,325 --> 00:30:42,261
No. No, that's impossible.

619
00:30:42,296 --> 00:30:43,995
We were supposed to do this together.

620
00:30:44,031 --> 00:30:46,798
Grace, I just wanted you to be happy.

621
00:30:46,833 --> 00:30:50,602
That's all I ever wanted.

622
00:30:50,638 --> 00:30:53,539
I love you, Grace. You're my family.

623
00:30:56,843 --> 00:31:01,180
And you'd do anything
to save me, right?

624
00:31:05,252 --> 00:31:07,752
I know what I have to do.

625
00:31:07,788 --> 00:31:09,288
Grace, stop.

626
00:31:12,293 --> 00:31:15,694
Grace, stop! Grace, please!

627
00:31:29,743 --> 00:31:32,010
Good evening, Dr. Wells.

628
00:31:32,045 --> 00:31:33,612
Bonjour, Gideon.

629
00:31:33,647 --> 00:31:39,117
I believe I have something
that belongs...

630
00:31:39,152 --> 00:31:40,419
right here.

631
00:31:40,454 --> 00:31:43,388
Video log, entry 247.

632
00:31:43,424 --> 00:31:45,156
I have long struggled

633
00:31:45,192 --> 00:31:47,526
with time's insistence on change.

634
00:31:47,561 --> 00:31:49,828
One variable changes the timeline.

635
00:31:49,863 --> 00:31:53,131
Our memories are changed
too, without any knowledge

636
00:31:53,166 --> 00:31:57,502
of time's other possibilities,
but not anymore.

637
00:31:57,538 --> 00:31:59,404
Where he is going with this?

638
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,173
Just as the human
body is made up of DNA,

639
00:32:02,209 --> 00:32:04,710
so, too, is the multiverse made up

640
00:32:04,745 --> 00:32:07,613
of its own unique source code.

641
00:32:07,648 --> 00:32:10,115
- Hmm.
- One that cannot be altered.

642
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:11,783
No matter what timeline you're in.

643
00:32:11,818 --> 00:32:13,184
Until now,

644
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:16,020
because I have cracked that code.

645
00:32:16,056 --> 00:32:17,922
Oh.

646
00:32:17,958 --> 00:32:20,592
And so the timeline, it can be malleable,

647
00:32:20,628 --> 00:32:23,562
but my knowledge...

648
00:32:23,597 --> 00:32:25,163
will be intractable.

649
00:32:25,198 --> 00:32:27,499
Gideon, freeze video log.

650
00:32:27,534 --> 00:32:29,668
Capture the clear board.

651
00:32:29,703 --> 00:32:32,804
Run against handwriting
sample number two.

652
00:32:32,839 --> 00:32:35,496
The journal of Nora West-Allen.

653
00:32:35,734 --> 00:32:38,013
ANALYZING HANDWRITING

654
00:32:38,014 --> 00:32:39,855
Analysis complete... handwriting match

655
00:32:39,856 --> 00:32:41,719
for Harrison Wells confirmed.

656
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,847
Will that be all, Dr. Wells?

657
00:32:44,184 --> 00:32:45,550
Yes, Gideon.

658
00:32:47,388 --> 00:32:49,053
That will be all.

659
00:32:52,295 --> 00:32:55,481
And that's why I didn't
tell you about my powers.

660
00:32:55,883 --> 00:32:58,086
I thought it would be too hard for you.

661
00:32:59,135 --> 00:33:00,656
But you're tough.

662
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:03,065
Tougher than I've ever been.

663
00:33:04,511 --> 00:33:08,023
So maybe you can be tough for me too?

664
00:33:11,795 --> 00:33:13,471
They're a good family.

665
00:33:15,015 --> 00:33:16,714
Told you they'd figure it out.

666
00:33:19,788 --> 00:33:21,188
Dad...

667
00:33:22,858 --> 00:33:24,891
I need to tell you something.

668
00:33:24,927 --> 00:33:27,761
- Ah!
- Oh, baby, what's wrong?

669
00:33:27,796 --> 00:33:29,029
Grace's mind.

670
00:33:29,064 --> 00:33:31,599
Oh, it's getting so much stronger.

671
00:33:35,238 --> 00:33:36,537
She's here.

672
00:34:02,998 --> 00:34:05,432
Are you okay?

673
00:34:05,468 --> 00:34:07,768
Vickie Bolen!

674
00:34:07,803 --> 00:34:10,271
Give yourself over to me,

675
00:34:10,306 --> 00:34:12,172
or your husband dies.

676
00:34:12,207 --> 00:34:14,575
This Cicada doesn't care
if someone's a meta or not.

677
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:16,343
She'll kill anyone who stands in her way.

678
00:34:16,379 --> 00:34:17,544
XS, get her out of here

679
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:18,812
before Cicada tries that again.

680
00:34:18,847 --> 00:34:20,681
Do not slow down.

681
00:34:20,716 --> 00:34:22,616
Detective, we need to
get her somewhere safe.

682
00:34:22,652 --> 00:34:23,850
Mom?

683
00:34:23,886 --> 00:34:25,085
I'm not leaving without Alice.

684
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,553
You're the target, Mrs. Bolen.

685
00:34:26,589 --> 00:34:27,755
She's safer without you.

686
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:29,323
Come on, now, let's go.

687
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:31,592
Come on, sweetie, let's
get you somewhere safe.

688
00:34:31,627 --> 00:34:33,727
XS, go!

689
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:43,470
- What do you got?
- Well, we have a situation.

690
00:34:43,506 --> 00:34:44,772
Or two, actually.

691
00:34:44,807 --> 00:34:46,507
So that's the new Cicada,

692
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:48,642
and that's the dagger
chasing Nora and Ms. Bolen.

693
00:34:48,678 --> 00:34:51,779
- Guys, I need help!
- Time to move.

694
00:34:51,814 --> 00:34:52,780
Grace.

695
00:34:52,815 --> 00:34:53,880
Let him go.

696
00:34:57,252 --> 00:34:58,985
I know you want revenge
for your parents, but...

697
00:34:59,021 --> 00:35:01,221
But it wasn't that woman's fault.

698
00:35:03,025 --> 00:35:06,427
That doesn't change that they're dead.

699
00:35:06,462 --> 00:35:07,761
Or that I became this.

700
00:35:07,797 --> 00:35:11,332
- We can help you.
- With your cure?

701
00:35:11,367 --> 00:35:15,936
There's only one cure for this, Flash.

702
00:35:15,971 --> 00:35:17,571
Death.

703
00:35:18,841 --> 00:35:20,407
Guys, I can't keep this up.

704
00:35:20,443 --> 00:35:22,242
Nora, you need to hang on
for a little bit longer.

705
00:35:22,277 --> 00:35:24,110
- You're gonna turn on...
- The alleyway on Fuller.

706
00:35:24,146 --> 00:35:25,412
The alleyway on Fuller. Be ready.

707
00:35:25,448 --> 00:35:26,447
For what?

708
00:35:41,364 --> 00:35:43,797
- Ooh, I am not loving that.
- Nope.

709
00:35:46,869 --> 00:35:48,502
Guys, we need you two at the hospital.

710
00:35:48,537 --> 00:35:49,870
Let's go.

711
00:35:56,412 --> 00:35:58,412
- What the hell was that?
- Cisco, what happened?

712
00:35:58,447 --> 00:35:59,613
I don't know.

713
00:35:59,648 --> 00:36:01,047
Something's wrong with my breach.

714
00:36:01,083 --> 00:36:02,549
We can't get through it!

715
00:36:02,585 --> 00:36:04,752
I've always wanted to
be up against the Flash

716
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:06,620
and his legendary team.

717
00:36:06,655 --> 00:36:10,457
I guess I wasn't missing
out on anything after all.

718
00:36:10,526 --> 00:36:12,893
Grace!

719
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:15,596
Don't do this.

720
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:17,197
Please.

721
00:36:17,232 --> 00:36:19,966
This isn't the way to make
the world a better place.

722
00:36:20,002 --> 00:36:21,001
You hated them.

723
00:36:23,305 --> 00:36:24,938
I heard you.

724
00:36:24,973 --> 00:36:27,173
I was wrong.

725
00:36:27,209 --> 00:36:31,678
And that hate turned into
something even worse.

726
00:36:31,714 --> 00:36:34,782
It was wrong to make you
feel that way, Gracie.

727
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:37,751
But you don't have to go
down the same path I did.

728
00:36:37,787 --> 00:36:41,955
You don't have to hold
on to this... this anger.

729
00:36:44,393 --> 00:36:46,293
Let it go.

730
00:36:53,001 --> 00:36:54,802
But my parents.

731
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:56,870
It was an accident.

732
00:36:58,273 --> 00:37:00,674
Let it go.

733
00:37:00,709 --> 00:37:04,177
Before it's too late, like it is for me.

734
00:37:07,316 --> 00:37:09,683
You're right, Uncle Orlin.

735
00:37:12,387 --> 00:37:13,821
Um...

736
00:37:15,357 --> 00:37:17,357
No!

737
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:23,630
It is too late.

738
00:37:30,172 --> 00:37:32,606
Ah!

739
00:37:35,344 --> 00:37:36,810
Hey, hey, hey.

740
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:43,550
Save my Grace.

741
00:38:00,202 --> 00:38:02,192
I can't believe she killed Dwyer.

742
00:38:02,193 --> 00:38:03,959
Yeah, as brutal as Dwyer was,

743
00:38:03,994 --> 00:38:05,428
his love for his niece always kept him

744
00:38:05,463 --> 00:38:06,562
from crossing certain lines.

745
00:38:06,597 --> 00:38:08,130
Not Grace.

746
00:38:08,165 --> 00:38:10,666
No, and her powers are
incredibly dangerous.

747
00:38:10,702 --> 00:38:13,068
I ran some tests while I was
at the Tannhauser offsite...

748
00:38:13,103 --> 00:38:15,538
her dark matter has some
sort of binding quality.

749
00:38:15,573 --> 00:38:17,440
It allows her to
telekinetically manipulate

750
00:38:17,475 --> 00:38:20,209
dark matter within a certain proximity.

751
00:38:20,244 --> 00:38:21,711
Including the dark matter in us?

752
00:38:21,746 --> 00:38:23,278
I think so.

753
00:38:23,314 --> 00:38:25,548
I think what makes her powers
different from Dwyer's

754
00:38:25,583 --> 00:38:27,550
is that they came from
a wound in her head.

755
00:38:27,585 --> 00:38:29,418
That's why she's so much stronger.

756
00:38:29,454 --> 00:38:31,587
How was Nora able to see
what Grace was seeing?

757
00:38:31,622 --> 00:38:33,922
Nora and Grace seem to
be psychically connected.

758
00:38:33,958 --> 00:38:35,924
I think it's because of
the time that Nora spent

759
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,292
in Grace's brain.

760
00:38:37,328 --> 00:38:39,762
- Is there any sign of her?
- No.

761
00:38:39,797 --> 00:38:41,697
She definitely ghosted.

762
00:38:41,733 --> 00:38:43,532
What about Vickie and her family?

763
00:38:43,568 --> 00:38:46,034
Uh, federal protection.
They're gonna be fine.

764
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:48,771
They're getting new
identities as we speak.

765
00:38:48,806 --> 00:38:50,038
I don't know about anyone else,

766
00:38:50,074 --> 00:38:51,607
but I could use a drink.

767
00:38:51,642 --> 00:38:53,709
- Not a bad idea.
- Yeah, I'm in.

768
00:38:53,745 --> 00:38:55,745
- You want me to call a sitter?
- Yeah.

769
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:58,146
Cisco, you want to bring Kamilla?

770
00:39:00,585 --> 00:39:02,184
Not for this one.

771
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:08,056
Nora, you coming?

772
00:39:08,092 --> 00:39:09,392
Nora.

773
00:39:10,661 --> 00:39:12,895
You want to tell us something, don't you?

774
00:39:16,333 --> 00:39:20,302
She wants to tell you her secret.

775
00:39:20,337 --> 00:39:21,937
Right?

776
00:39:21,972 --> 00:39:24,640
She doesn't know where to start.

777
00:39:24,675 --> 00:39:27,342
Difficult to know where to begin

778
00:39:27,378 --> 00:39:32,882
when your secret threatens everything,

779
00:39:32,917 --> 00:39:33,982
everyone around you.

780
00:39:34,018 --> 00:39:35,284
Sherloque, stop it.

781
00:39:35,319 --> 00:39:37,119
Maybe start at the beginning.

782
00:39:37,154 --> 00:39:38,287
It's a very good place to start.

783
00:39:38,322 --> 00:39:41,123
When you first time-traveled.

784
00:39:41,158 --> 00:39:45,294
So careful to leave the
lightest footprint.

785
00:39:45,329 --> 00:39:47,430
Until you suddenly change course

786
00:39:47,465 --> 00:39:50,466
and brazenly interfere
with the Thinker satellite

787
00:39:50,501 --> 00:39:52,034
as it crashed to Earth.

788
00:39:52,069 --> 00:39:54,336
I think to myself, "Nope, nope.

789
00:39:54,371 --> 00:40:00,443
This excessive action
doesn't make sense."

790
00:40:00,478 --> 00:40:03,846
Until you understand that...

791
00:40:03,881 --> 00:40:05,514
it wasn't your idea.

792
00:40:07,919 --> 00:40:09,685
Please stop.

793
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,253
Someone instructed you to do it.

794
00:40:11,288 --> 00:40:13,722
- Stop.
- Someone...

795
00:40:13,758 --> 00:40:17,059
whose handwriting is in your journal.

796
00:40:17,094 --> 00:40:21,396
Someone who wrote, "The
timeline is malleable."

797
00:40:21,432 --> 00:40:25,133
Same person who's been
directing you all this time,

798
00:40:25,169 --> 00:40:27,970
making puppets of all of us

799
00:40:28,005 --> 00:40:30,005
as he seeks to alter the timeline

800
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,907
to suit his own purpose.

801
00:40:33,611 --> 00:40:35,478
Eobard Thawne.

802
00:40:37,081 --> 00:40:39,915
The Reverse-Flash. Your teacher.

803
00:40:39,951 --> 00:40:42,518
Your partner.

804
00:40:42,553 --> 00:40:46,021
Your secret.

805
00:40:46,056 --> 00:40:47,857
Nora?

806
00:40:50,094 --> 00:40:52,461
Please tell us this isn't true.

807
00:40:56,433 --> 00:40:58,501
She can't.

808
00:40:58,536 --> 00:41:00,703
- Dad...
- Because it is true.

809
00:41:02,573 --> 00:41:05,107
Mom?

810
00:41:05,142 --> 00:41:07,175
I wanted to tell you.

811
00:41:07,211 --> 00:41:09,578
I-I tried to tell you.

812
00:41:13,951 --> 00:41:15,818
Dad.

813
00:41:15,853 --> 00:41:18,220
Dad, please!

814
00:41:18,255 --> 00:41:20,022
Dad!

815
00:41:20,057 --> 00:41:23,191
I'm sorry I lied to you!

816
00:41:28,533 --> 00:41:30,098
So am I.

817
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:37,205
Dad...

818
00:41:41,755 --> 00:41:49,465
