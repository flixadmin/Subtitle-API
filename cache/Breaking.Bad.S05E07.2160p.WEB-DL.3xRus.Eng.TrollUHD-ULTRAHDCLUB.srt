1
00:00:25,234 --> 00:00:26,777
There.

2
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:29,738
That's them.

3
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:45,044
Your play, Walter. You're on your own.

4
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:02,854
Looks like you're about 1000 gallons
light here, Mike.

5
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:04,565
Where's the juice?

6
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:07,526
The methylamine isn't coming.

7
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:11,613
Why is that?

8
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,639
- And who the hell are you?
- I'm the man who's keeping it.

9
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:18,453
What the hell's this?

10
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,164
We had an agreement, right?
We got our deal.

11
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:22,666
So where's the tank, Mike?

12
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:25,586
Mike doesn't know where it is.
Only I do.

13
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,670
And you're dealing with me now, not him.

14
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:30,089
Why don't you just cut
to what it is you want,

15
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,675
or what you think
is gonna happen here, all right?

16
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,677
Because we're gonna get what we came for.

17
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:37,806
That 1000 gallons of methylamine
is worth more in my hands

18
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:40,851
than it is in yours or anyone else's,
for that matter.

19
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:44,563
But I need distribution.

20
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:46,231
Distribution.

21
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:48,150
That's right.

22
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:51,987
So if you agree to give up your cook,

23
00:01:52,154 --> 00:01:54,656
and sell my product instead

24
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:57,075
I'll give you 35 percent of the take.

25
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,910
Thirty-five percent?

26
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:01,038
Wow, are you kidding me?
Thirty-five...

27
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:04,124
Mike, please tell me this is a joke.

28
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:07,669
Know how far we had to stick our
necks out to get our hands on this cash?

29
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:11,403
Why the hell would we want you? You
know we have our own operation, right?

30
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:13,842
I know all about your operation.

31
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:17,304
See, my partners here tell me
that you produce a meth

32
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:20,766
that's 70 percent pure, if you're lucky.

33
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:25,187
What I produce is 99.1 percent pure.

34
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:26,688
So?

35
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:33,862
So it's grade school T-ball

36
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:36,448
versus the New York Yankees.

37
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:39,868
Yours is just some tepid

38
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:43,455
off-brand, generic cola.

39
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:47,250
What I'm making is Classic Coke.

40
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,878
All right. Okay.

41
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:54,716
So if we just waste you
right here right now,

42
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,509
and leave you in the desert

43
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:59,388
then there is no more Coke
on the market, right?

44
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:02,057
See how that works? There's only us.

45
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:05,977
Do you really wanna live
in a world without Coca-Cola?

46
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,366
My partner tells me that your crew

47
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:22,577
switched to a P2P cook
because of our success.

48
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:26,205
You dye your meth with food coloring
to make it look like mine.

49
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:30,502
You already ape my product at every turn.

50
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:32,546
But now

51
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:35,298
you have the opportunity
to sell it yourself.

52
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:36,883
I need you to listen to me.

53
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,969
We're not gonna give up this deal

54
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:42,097
to be your errand boys,
do you understand?

55
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,474
For what?

56
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,851
To watch a bunch of junkies
get a better high?

57
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:50,480
A better high means customers pay more.

58
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:55,569
A higher purity means a greater yield.

59
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:59,114
That's 130 million dollars of profit

60
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:03,285
that isn't being pissed away
by some substandard cook.

61
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,579
Now you listen to me.

62
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:09,833
You've got the greatest meth cook in A...
No, the two

63
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,880
greatest meth cooks in America
right here, and with our skills

64
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:18,008
you'll earn more from that 35 percent

65
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:19,884
than you ever would on your own.

66
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:22,137
Yeah. So you say.

67
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:24,306
Just wondering why we're so lucky.

68
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,558
Why cut us in?

69
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:29,144
Mike is retiring from our crew,

70
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,897
so his share of the partnership
is available

71
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:37,194
if you can handle his end, distribution,

72
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:41,656
and if you give him 5 million dollars
of the 15 million that you brought today.

73
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:45,827
Just think of it as a finder's fee
for bringing us together.

74
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:51,249
We have 40 pounds of product
ready to ship, ready to go.

75
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,127
Are you ready?

76
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,982
Who the hell are you?

77
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,276
You know.

78
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:21,988
You all know exactly who I am.

79
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:26,159
Say my name.

80
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:30,413
Do what? I don't have a damn clue
who the hell you are.

81
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,875
Yeah, you do. I'm the cook.

82
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:38,547
I'm the man who killed Gus Fring.

83
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:41,550
Bullshit. Cartel got Fring.

84
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:43,510
Are you sure?

85
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:55,105
That's right.

86
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:59,234
Now, say my name.

87
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,324
You're Heisenberg.

88
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,495
You're goddamn right.

89
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:47,616
{\an8}I gotta hand it to you, Walter.

90
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,246
{\an8}Hey.

91
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:56,082
{\an8}I appreciate the kind words,

92
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:59,336
{\an8}but I'm out too, remember?

93
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,255
{\an8}I know. We'll talk.

94
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:09,804
{\an8}Maybe we should talk about how and
when I'm gonna get my 5 million dollars.

95
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,890
{\an8}And we will do that.

96
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:13,558
{\an8}Absolutely.

97
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:15,352
It's just, you know...

98
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:18,563
Look, Jesse, just give me
some time here, okay?

99
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,983
I'll need help getting things
up and running during this transition.

100
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:24,361
You can at least do that for me, right?

101
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:30,325
Come on. Don't worry.
We'll figure it out.

102
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:04,776
{\an8}Well, I guess that's it.

103
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:06,843
{\an8}Parting thoughts, of which I have two:

104
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:08,822
{\an8}First, as I said

105
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:11,240
{\an8}I'll handle the legacy costs
out of my end,

106
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:15,495
{\an8}so you won't have to worry about
my guys anymore. Second, the bug.

107
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:18,915
The DEA will do a sweep.
Can't say when, could be anytime.

108
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:22,961
{\an8}But you need to get it out of there,
sooner rather than later.

109
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,298
All right.

110
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,217
That's it?

111
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:35,724
No "thanks for the 5 million dollars," no
"sorry for chaining you to a radiator"?

112
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:39,394
{\an8}Just get the bug, Walter.

113
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:48,028
{\an8}So, hey.

114
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,282
{\an8}I guess...

115
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,409
I guess I'll see you around.

116
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:56,995
{\an8}No. Don't think so.

117
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:59,205
{\an8}When I'm out, I'm out.

118
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:03,209
Well, I'm out too, Mike.

119
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:10,383
Kid, just look out for yourself.

120
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:57,222
- Are we good?
- You tell me.

121
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,767
Okay, Jesse. Back it up.

122
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:07,398
{\an8}You're good. Keep it coming.
Straight back.

123
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,275
Slow it down.

124
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,319
{\an8}All right. That's good.

125
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:19,619
Hey, Mrs. White.

126
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,092
"Vamonos."

127
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,845
I wish.

128
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:39,764
All right. Let's get this thing hooked up.

129
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:42,142
Walt.

130
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:49,065
What is this?

131
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,442
Do you really wanna know?

132
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:56,239
- Why are you hiding it here?
- Don't worry about it.

133
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:57,991
Who are you hiding it from?

134
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,827
I said don't worry about it.

135
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,120
From the police?

136
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,415
Or someone else?

137
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,209
Someone who would kill for it?

138
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,503
Why don't you go back in the office?

139
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:16,384
Why don't you go back in the office
and let us do this?

140
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:18,636
We'll get it out of your hair.

141
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:53,212
What'd you bring me this time?

142
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,006
They're bacon banana cookies.

143
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:58,217
Is there bacon in these? Oh, my God!

144
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,219
Just bits. Just little bits of bacon.

145
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:02,971
Just enough to make
those suckers really pop.

146
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:06,017
Dan, this is too much.

147
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,325
I'm not sharing those.

148
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,478
Bad office etiquette?
I don't give a crap.

149
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,147
- They're mine.
- They're yours to do with as you please.

150
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,983
Good, because my husband's
not getting any either.

151
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,278
- How is Mickey?
- Don't get me started.

152
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:18,946
He wants to buy a boat.

153
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,866
I can't even get him
to start the lawn mower,

154
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:24,035
and he wants to buy a boat.

155
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:26,162
I don't know. A boat might be nice.

156
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:28,164
A little one, maybe.

157
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:31,209
Oh, please.
Where would you even take a boat?

158
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,836
All the way down to Elephant Butte?

159
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:37,173
Or Caballo. It's beautiful down there.

160
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:40,342
You can even leave it at the lake
if you don't want to haul it.

161
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:44,388
We're not buying a boat,
I'll tell you that right now.

162
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:48,809
- And the last one is 545.
- 569.

163
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:52,522
- Dang it. I almost got them all that time.
- Very good.

164
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:56,651
But actually, I've got an extra one
for you this week. 603.

165
00:12:57,025 --> 00:13:00,446
- 603. Where is that?
- Right down there.

166
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:06,911
All right. I'll let you get to it.

167
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:08,704
Thanks, Dot.

168
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:38,835
Young Kaylee's gonna need
a second safety deposit box

169
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:41,714
if you decide to leave
one more dollar to her.

170
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,176
How's the rest of it?

171
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:47,345
Oh, it's empty, as usual.

172
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:50,222
The families are pretty reliable
with the pickups.

173
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,683
Nobody complaining
about wanting it all at once?

174
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:56,604
No, they get it.
Slow and steady wins the race.

175
00:14:57,938 --> 00:15:00,358
So I guess this is it for a while?

176
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,694
Don't worry about the families.

177
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:06,238
They'll keep getting their deliveries.

178
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,708
<i>I know times are tight,
but it's for the kids,</i>

179
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,586
<i>and your sponsorship
would sure be appreciated.</i>

180
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:24,632
<i>Yeah, we have a silver level,
but the gold and platinum levels</i>

181
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:29,637
<i>really get your name out there
on the banners and T-shirts.</i>

182
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:35,226
<i>Sure. No, that's not a problem. You call
me directly if things change, you hear?</i>

183
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:40,677
<i>Gomey, take a brick to my head if I
ever have to make another Fun Run call.</i>

184
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,775
<i>I'm done.</i>

185
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,194
<i>What's up? Why you smiling?</i>

186
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,487
<i>Because the Ehrmantraut warrant
just came in.</i>

187
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:50,571
<i>Now we're talking. How quick
can you get your group together?</i>

188
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,242
<i>- Two, three hours.
- Make it two.</i>

189
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,537
<i>We're gonna nail that son of a bi...</i>

190
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,421
Police! Search warrant!

191
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,054
Police! Search warrant!

192
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:38,224
Coming. Hold your horses.

193
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,645
Search warrant.

194
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:44,396
Police! Search warrant!

195
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:47,650
- Police. Search warrant.
- Police. Search warrant.

196
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:50,319
How's that restraining order
working out for you?

197
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:54,323
If you want me to read that,
I'm gonna need my glasses.

198
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,206
<i>Too bad you had to make the trip out
from headquarters, sergeant.</i>

199
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:07,090
<i>From out of bed, you mean. When a cop
kills himself, they want a full report.</i>

200
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:10,297
<i>Just to say hello to who's in charge
of the Record Bureau.</i>

201
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:12,466
<i>A single contact wound.</i>

202
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,802
<i>Powder burn on his temple and right hand.</i>

203
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:16,554
<i>Suicide, I'll bet you.</i>

204
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,847
<i>- Tell the wagon boys they can have him.
- Yes.</i>

205
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:22,810
<i>When I found him, he was...
He was dead.</i>

206
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:32,486
Hey! Perfect timing.

207
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,864
Just about to get started.

208
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,993
You know, if you can get going
on that settling tank

209
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,121
that would be a huge help.

210
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:46,000
We left that stuff in there too long
after the last cook.

211
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,419
- Mr. White...
- I mean way too long.

212
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:50,838
Now we have a tremendous amount
of residue.

213
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:53,883
You know what we need to invest in
is a power washer.

214
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:58,554
Mr. White, can we just take a second
and talk about all this?

215
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,853
Yeah, yeah, sure.

216
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,396
Yeah.

217
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:17,323
Look, you know what I think
we need to talk about?

218
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:19,658
Is doubling down.

219
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,577
Doubling down?

220
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:25,039
Cooking 100 pounds a week, not 50.

221
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:29,168
As in starting a new lab,
a lab that you'll run.

222
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:31,462
A cook all of your own.

223
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:34,506
Why not? You deserve it.

224
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:37,301
You're every bit as good as me.

225
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,512
Well, what do you think?

226
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:46,810
Mr. White, I think that
nothing has changed for me.

227
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:51,065
I just wanna get my money and get out.

228
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:55,486
Jesse, this...

229
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:00,324
What we do...

230
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,914
being the best at something

231
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:08,540
is a very rare thing.

232
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,627
You don't just toss
something like that away.

233
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:15,923
And what, you wanna squander
that potential?

234
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:18,968
Your potential? Why?

235
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:20,761
To do what?

236
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:24,598
- I don't know.
- Well, think.

237
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:27,810
To do what, Jesse?

238
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:32,982
I'll... I'll figure it out, all right?

239
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:34,191
Look at you.

240
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:39,613
What have you got in your life, huh?
Nothing. Nobody.

241
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,573
Oh, wait. Yes.

242
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,076
- Video games and go-carts.
- Mr. W...

243
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:47,162
And when you get tired of that,
what then?

244
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:50,290
And how soon will you start using again?

245
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:55,170
Look...

246
00:20:55,337 --> 00:21:00,259
Look, I know how upset you are
about what happened to this boy.

247
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:02,928
I am just as upset as you are.

248
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:06,306
Are you? Really?

249
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,478
How can you say that to me? Jesus!

250
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:14,023
I mean, I'm the one
who's the father here.

251
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:17,526
What, do I have to curl up in a ball
in tears in front of you?

252
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:21,363
Do I have to lock myself away in a room
and get high to prove it to you?

253
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,324
What happened to that boy is a tragedy,

254
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:26,660
and it tears me up inside!

255
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:30,539
But because it happened, what,
am I supposed to just lie down,

256
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:34,334
and die with him? It's done!

257
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:36,252
It makes me sick that it happened

258
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:39,173
just like everyone else
who has died in our wake.

259
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:40,549
What Todd did

260
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:44,428
you and I have done things
that are just as bad.

261
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:45,971
Yeah.

262
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:51,393
All the people that we've killed,
Gale and the rest.

263
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:55,060
If you believe that there's a hell,
I don't know if you're into that,

264
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:58,901
but we're already pretty much
going there, right?

265
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:02,446
But I'm not gonna lie down
until I get there.

266
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:06,950
What, just because I don't wanna
cook meth anymore, I'm lying down?

267
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:09,452
How many more people
are gonna die because of us?

268
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:11,789
No one. None.

269
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:14,541
Now that we're in control,
no one else gets hurt.

270
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:18,253
You keep saying that,
and it's bullshit every time!

271
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,547
- No.
- Always! You know what?

272
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:24,051
I'm done, okay?

273
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:30,099
You just give me my money,
and you and I, we're done.

274
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:36,730
Okay.

275
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:38,941
Why?

276
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:43,904
Why do you want this money?

277
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:48,450
Because it's mine. It's my cut.

278
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:50,994
But isn't it filthy blood money?

279
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:54,456
I mean, you're so pure.
You have such emotional depth.

280
00:22:54,622 --> 00:22:57,376
No, no, no. You shouldn't touch
that dirty money.

281
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,878
I'll save you from that, Jesse.

282
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:02,756
Come on.

283
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,383
You want it.

284
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:07,052
You want it just as much as I want it.

285
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:11,390
And it's not wrong to want it. Okay?

286
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:15,227
So stay and work with me,

287
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:18,646
and you can make ten ti...
Twenty times as much.

288
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,987
Whatever, man.

289
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:29,366
You don't wanna pay me, I don't care.

290
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:33,412
- Yes, you do.
- It's on you, all right?

291
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:36,164
- I'm done.
- No, you're not.

292
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:41,420
You're not done. You're not leaving.
Because if you leave, you get nothing!

293
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:44,756
Do you understand me? Nothing!

294
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:47,426
Jesse!

295
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:55,016
<i>Budget for the current fiscal year
for electronic surveillance</i>

296
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:59,480
<i>is 1.5 million, on par with
ATF and the Marshal Service,</i>

297
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:01,941
<i>but still just a fraction of FBI totals.</i>

298
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,527
<i>We're lobbying Congress
for an additional 1.41,</i>

299
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:07,443
<i>but we're waiting on action reports
to demonstrate</i>

300
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:11,659
<i>we're actually getting worthwhile
results. Our undercover operations</i>

301
00:24:11,826 --> 00:24:14,411
<i>reap the most successful
actionable intelligence</i>

302
00:24:14,495 --> 00:24:17,206
<i>if you refer to the chart in Appendix 4.</i>

303
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:21,293
<i>If ASAC Schrader can tell us about
the surveillance man-hours...</i>

304
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,837
<i>Hank?</i>

305
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:25,005
<i>Hank?</i>

306
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:26,757
<i>Hank!</i>

307
00:24:27,758 --> 00:24:30,302
<i>I think we're going to wrap this up.</i>

308
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:34,473
<i>If ASAC Schrader can stay behind
while everyone else clears out.</i>

309
00:24:35,266 --> 00:24:36,809
<i>Thank you, everybody.</i>

310
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:51,198
<i>You know no one wants</i>

311
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:53,814
<i>to see you succeed at this
more than me, right?</i>

312
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:56,036
- Yes, sir.
- <i>I know how good you are.</i>

313
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:59,164
<i>I wouldn't have stuck my neck out
to get you here if I didn't.</i>

314
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:01,698
<i>But you're not knocking down
doors anymore, bubba.</i>

315
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:06,130
<i>You're in charge of a district office,
and that comes with responsibilities.</i>

316
00:25:06,297 --> 00:25:10,593
<i>I mean, Hank, basic reports
aren't being filed in a timely manner.</i>

317
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,459
I'll work on it. It'll get better.

318
00:25:12,595 --> 00:25:15,180
<i>Yeah, it will, because way too much
time and money</i>

319
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:18,714
<i>is being spent on the Fring case,
a case which is essentially over.</i>

320
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:22,146
<i>All this overtime to surveil
Michael Ehrmantraut?</i>

321
00:25:22,313 --> 00:25:24,898
<i>That's just money that could
be better spent elsewhere.</i>

322
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:28,068
I understand, but I'm not making
these choices lightly.

323
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:30,946
We've got increased reports
of blue meth on the street

324
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:35,075
Fring's gang is still operational, and
Ehrmantraut is involved. It's that simple.

325
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:36,509
<i>I believe you. But so what?</i>

326
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:39,454
<i>It's one case out of dozens,
and you don't play favorites</i>

327
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:42,458
<i>- with it because it used to be yours.</i>
- I really think...

328
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:45,252
<i>Don't play favorites.
You got a bigger job than that.</i>

329
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:47,504
<i>I mean, forget the financial cost.</i>

330
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:50,925
<i>I hear you're personally serving
search warrants out in the field?</i>

331
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:53,468
That was an error in judgment.
Won't happen again.

332
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:56,805
<i>You're damn right it won't.
I'm just gonna bottom-line this for you.</i>

333
00:25:56,889 --> 00:26:00,433
<i>The surveillance budget for Ehrmantraut
is now zero. We clear?</i>

334
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:04,396
Sure. Thank you.

335
00:26:04,647 --> 00:26:06,774
- Clear.
- <i>Good.</i>

336
00:26:06,941 --> 00:26:08,692
<i>We'll be in touch.</i>

337
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:21,914
Yeah?

338
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:24,625
- Hey.
- Hey.

339
00:26:29,672 --> 00:26:32,257
So Ramey wanted to catch up with you?

340
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,885
Talk sports and stuff, I guess?

341
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:36,512
Yeah, something like that.

342
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:39,223
No more following Ehrmantraut.

343
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:42,601
Not worth the financial investment.

344
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:44,936
Well, it's not like
the guy's going anywhere.

345
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,520
He's not even bothering
to throw our tails anymore.

346
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:52,319
He's just living a boring old-man life
like he has nothing left to hide.

347
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:56,031
- And none of Fring's crew is talking?
- Not giving an inch.

348
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:57,866
You sweeten the pot enough?

349
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:01,370
Zero jail time and an all-expense-paid
trip to Maui?

350
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:04,790
Not that, but close.
Nobody wants to bite.

351
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:06,333
Christ!

352
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:10,295
They're either the most loyal crew in
history or someone's paying them off.

353
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:13,715
- You still checking bank records?
- No one living beyond their means.

354
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:17,302
Nine perps, all being represented
by one lawyer.

355
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,304
Not unusual in a case like this.

356
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:23,684
Yeah, this guy, what's his name?
Daniel Wachsberger?

357
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:29,940
He represents every one of these
douche bags except for Ehrmantraut.

358
00:27:30,107 --> 00:27:32,007
Can we find out more about the lawyer?

359
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:34,319
You want me to start tailing a lawyer?

360
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:37,114
Like the shit ain't deep enough
for you already.

361
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:39,331
Ramey said we couldn't
follow Ehrmantraut.

362
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,541
He didn't say anything
about anybody else.

363
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,121
Do it.

364
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,665
You're the boss.

365
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:15,110
All right. Shall we get started?

366
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:19,406
Now, I know that most of this,
or all of this, is gonna be new to you.

367
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:23,452
But did you take chemistry
in high school?

368
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:24,912
Just basic?

369
00:28:25,496 --> 00:28:26,705
No.

370
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:28,916
Okay. That's all right.

371
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:34,213
As we go, I'll be as detailed as possible
without being overwhelming.

372
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:36,924
Yes, sir.

373
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:44,098
Look, Todd, I don't need you
to be Antoine Lavoisier.

374
00:28:44,598 --> 00:28:48,227
What I do need is your full effort
and attention.

375
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,646
Listen and apply yourself.

376
00:28:50,813 --> 00:28:56,485
If you do that, then we just might have
a fighting chance here, okay?

377
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:01,365
- Okay.
- Okay.

378
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:04,284
Well, here we go.

379
00:29:17,548 --> 00:29:21,635
Slowly. Steady.

380
00:29:35,149 --> 00:29:39,069
The aluminum helps speed up
the delivery of hydrogen chloride.

381
00:29:44,158 --> 00:29:46,368
Gently pour it in. Don't spill it.

382
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:32,664
<i>You're gonna like the little Schticky,
but you're gonna love the big Schticky.</i>

383
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:35,250
<i>For bigger messes like dust bunnies...</i>

384
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,876
Now

385
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:21,004
the CO2 freezes the liquid

386
00:31:21,171 --> 00:31:23,257
crystallizing it

387
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:26,718
which gives us our finished
methamphetamine.

388
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:32,182
Now all that's left

389
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:36,061
is to break it up, weigh it,
and we're done.

390
00:31:37,104 --> 00:31:39,398
Wow, this is...

391
00:31:40,983 --> 00:31:46,738
This is complicated. It's gonna take me
a few more times to get a grasp on it.

392
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:50,617
Oh, yeah. It'll take a few more times.

393
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:56,081
I do all right?

394
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,918
You did fine, Todd.

395
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:03,088
You applied yourself.
That's as much as I can ask.

396
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:07,301
Now all that's left,
I guess, is to talk money.

397
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:10,595
We can talk money once I get this right.

398
00:32:21,315 --> 00:32:24,318
Morning. Guess what I have.

399
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:29,197
Cake pops.
They're balls of cake on a stick.

400
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:33,452
Very nice. Thank you, Dan.

401
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:36,038
See? I put little faces on them.

402
00:32:58,018 --> 00:32:59,478
Hey.

403
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:03,023
Hey.

404
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:21,375
All right.

405
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:50,904
I'm working with a new guy now.

406
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:54,825
And I think that it...

407
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:59,704
I think it could possibly work out

408
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,665
because...

409
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:11,675
I'm trying, Hank. I really am.
I'm trying, but there's... There's...

410
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:16,513
{\an8}I mean,
it's like I don't even exist to her.

411
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,808
{\an8}Well, yeah. Yeah.

412
00:34:19,975 --> 00:34:24,813
{\an8}I mean, I know she's struggling.
I know, but I just don't know what to do.

413
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,982
{\an8}I mean, what can I do?

414
00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:29,192
Such a mess.

415
00:34:31,278 --> 00:34:32,696
I mean, we... Both of us

416
00:34:32,863 --> 00:34:36,366
we just have screwed up so much.

417
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:39,911
I'm just...

418
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:43,790
I'm sorry. I don't...
Do you have any coffee?

419
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:46,209
{\an8}- Maybe I can...
- Coffee? You bet. Yeah, you bet.

420
00:34:46,293 --> 00:34:48,879
{\an8}- What, you take cream, right? Yeah.
- Yeah.

421
00:35:23,914 --> 00:35:26,499
- All right. Here you go, buddy.
- Oh, thank you, Hank.

422
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:29,628
- Yeah.
- Look, I'm sorry to waste your time

423
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,213
- with all this.
- No.

424
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:34,466
- It's, you know... But it's... You know.
- Yeah.

425
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:40,847
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

426
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:43,558
Hey, could you excuse me?

427
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:46,019
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure, sure.

428
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:48,146
- Tell me something good.
- You tell me.

429
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:51,399
Sweated the guy for 14 hours.
That should be some kind of record.

430
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:53,401
Quit your bragging. What'd you get?

431
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:56,738
He's gonna do it. He's gonna flip.

432
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:59,366
He's willing to give us Ehrmantraut?

433
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:06,194
What are you wasting your time for?
Throw a net around that son of a bitch.

434
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:08,250
All right.

435
00:36:39,448 --> 00:36:41,283
- Yeah?
<i>- Mike, hey, it's me.</i>

436
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:43,035
<i>- Can you talk?</i>
- I can.

437
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:46,371
<i>Great. Look, there's a small
situation with the money.</i>

438
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:49,708
<i>I don't wanna do this on the phone.
Are you available?</i>

439
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:51,752
I can come by in a few hours.

440
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:54,087
<i>That's not good for me.
Where are you now?</i>

441
00:36:54,254 --> 00:36:56,339
I'm at the park with my granddaughter.

442
00:36:56,506 --> 00:36:57,883
<i>Where exactly?</i>

443
00:36:58,842 --> 00:37:00,135
Palomita.

444
00:37:00,302 --> 00:37:03,752
<i>Oh, you know what? I'm not far.
I'll come to you. You just hang tight.</i>

445
00:37:12,481 --> 00:37:14,381
- Yeah?
<i>- Mike, they're coming for you.</i>

446
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:16,985
<i>- Right now. They're coming.</i>
- Slow down, Walter. Who?

447
00:37:17,069 --> 00:37:19,988
<i>The DEA. The DEA...
Somebody flipped.</i>

448
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:23,116
<i>They have some kind of bank surveillance.</i>

449
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:24,867
<i>And something about some lawyer.</i>

450
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:28,622
<i>Someone is talking, Mike,
and they're coming for you right now...</i>

451
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:21,633
How could Mike use
that clown of a lawyer?

452
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,135
Dan Wachsberger.

453
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:26,596
He would've had better luck with
the law firm of Moe, Larry and Shemp.

454
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,432
Always consult with me
before using outside counsel.

455
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:33,228
All right, Saul, enough, please.
Instead of just sitting around here

456
00:38:33,395 --> 00:38:36,045
- what can we do?
- Besides pray that he gets away

457
00:38:36,189 --> 00:38:37,816
I'm open to ideas.

458
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:39,983
Because if the DEA catches up with him,

459
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:43,196
and he flips, it's good night, John-boy.

460
00:38:43,363 --> 00:38:48,451
No. No way Mike would ever flip, okay?
No way.

461
00:38:48,618 --> 00:38:51,788
Yeah, yeah. Never say never.

462
00:38:51,955 --> 00:38:56,168
This is the second time the DEA
has confiscated his bankroll.

463
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,962
You know? Jesus, fool me once, right?

464
00:38:59,129 --> 00:39:00,589
Look, he won't flip.

465
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:04,259
But his nine guys will.

466
00:39:20,442 --> 00:39:23,486
Hey. It's him.

467
00:39:26,031 --> 00:39:29,326
Mike, I got you on speaker phone
with the brain trust.

468
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:33,371
<i>- The what?</i>
- The... Walt and Jesse are here.

469
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:36,582
<i>I don't want Walt and Jesse, Saul.
I want you. I need your help.</i>

470
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:39,586
- What do you need?
- I got a go-bag at the airport.

471
00:39:39,753 --> 00:39:42,172
Passports, money,
but there are eyes everywhere.

472
00:39:42,339 --> 00:39:43,840
I can't get close.

473
00:39:44,007 --> 00:39:48,053
I need you to pick up that bag
and get it to me as soon as possible.

474
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:50,596
Do you know how thick
the crap storm is out there?

475
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,849
Told you not to use that lawyer.
He's a hack!

476
00:39:52,933 --> 00:39:56,769
- Shut up, Saul, and get the bag.
- Hey, Mike, I can get it to you, all right?

477
00:39:56,853 --> 00:40:00,357
- Just tell me what to do.
- <i>No, kid. Not you.</i>

478
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:02,723
I'm paying Saul.
He can do the job just fine.

479
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:05,809
Yeah, you're paying me,
and the DEA knows I represent you,

480
00:40:05,946 --> 00:40:09,824
so they're probably sitting on my car
right now, hoping I do something stupid.

481
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:12,494
Mike, I can do it, okay?
It's not a problem.

482
00:40:12,661 --> 00:40:14,454
- No, Jesse.
- Jesus, I'll do it.

483
00:40:14,621 --> 00:40:16,122
Besides, you're out, remember?

484
00:40:16,623 --> 00:40:19,501
Mike, tell me where to get this bag.

485
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:35,118
Hello, Walter.

486
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:40,749
Before I hand this over,
I need something from you.

487
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:44,544
- And what's that?
- The names of your nine men.

488
00:41:46,046 --> 00:41:49,674
Why? You're never gonna pay them off.
What's the point?

489
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:52,886
The point is, Mike, it affects me.

490
00:41:53,053 --> 00:41:56,723
It affects Jesse too.
And we deserve to know.

491
00:41:56,890 --> 00:42:00,852
The only thing left to do now
is leave town. You understand?

492
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:03,063
"Leave town."

493
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:07,150
Yeah, I just can't up and leave
like you, Mike.

494
00:42:07,317 --> 00:42:10,570
I've got a family,
I've got people who depend on me.

495
00:42:10,737 --> 00:42:12,405
Yeah.

496
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:29,798
Goodbye, Walter.

497
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:35,011
You're welcome!

498
00:42:38,848 --> 00:42:40,850
I'm sorry, what?

499
00:42:41,017 --> 00:42:43,269
I want those names, Mike.
You owe me that much.

500
00:42:43,353 --> 00:42:44,813
I don't owe you a damn thing.

501
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:49,150
All of this, falling apart like this,
is on you.

502
00:42:52,404 --> 00:42:55,740
Oh, that's some kind of logic
right there, Mike.

503
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:58,701
You screw up, get yourself
followed by the DEA,

504
00:42:58,868 --> 00:43:01,287
and now suddenly, this is all my fault?

505
00:43:01,454 --> 00:43:04,290
- Why don't you walk me through this?
- We had a good thing

506
00:43:04,374 --> 00:43:08,336
you stupid son of a bitch!
We had Fring. We had a lab.

507
00:43:08,628 --> 00:43:11,422
We had everything we needed,
and it all ran like clockwork.

508
00:43:11,506 --> 00:43:13,706
- Oh, my God.
- You could've shut your mouth

509
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,302
cooked, and made as much money
as you ever needed.

510
00:43:16,386 --> 00:43:19,639
It was perfect.
But, no, you just had to blow it up.

511
00:43:19,806 --> 00:43:22,892
You and your pride and your ego!

512
00:43:23,059 --> 00:43:24,894
You just had to be the man.

513
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:27,439
If you'd done your job, known your place

514
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:30,066
we'd all be fine right now.

515
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:46,286
I just...

516
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:50,665
I just realized that Lydia has the names.
I can get them from her.

517
00:45:55,628 --> 00:45:57,755
I'm sorry, Mike.

518
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:02,635
This... This whole thing
could've been avoided.

519
00:46:02,844 --> 00:46:04,929
Shut the fuck up...

520
00:46:07,849 --> 00:46:10,560
and let me die in peace.
