00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,571
[APPLAUSE]

160
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:57,912
IS IT ALL RIGHT
FOR ME TO BE HERE?

161
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:00,081
I'M SURE IT'S OK.
HEY.

162
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:02,792
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
STILL IN REHAB, CONNOR.

163
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:05,337
WHAT'S THE MATTER, TRUST FUND?
YOU DON'T WANT ME AT
YOUR FANCY LITTLE PARTY?

164
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:07,422
AS LONG AS YOU DON'T
PUNCH ANYONE OR
SET ANYTHING ON FIRE,

165
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:09,049
WE'LL BE OK.

166
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:13,053
CAN WE JUST TRY TO GET ALONG
FOR ONE NIGHT, PLEASE?

167
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,681
-BE RIGHT BACK.
-OK.

168
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:19,100
HEY, TREV, HAVE YOU
SEEN BIANCA?

169
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:20,768
SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
HERE AN HOUR AGO.

170
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,729
HEH! NO, I'M NOT
HER KEEPER ANYMORE.

171
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,356
OK, I THOUGHT YOU
GUYS WERE STILL COOL.

172
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:26,024
NO, WE ARE, BUT EVEN WHEN
WE WERE TOGETHER,

173
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,401
SHE NEVER TOLD ME
WHERE SHE WAS.

174
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:28,985
BUT YOU WERE THE LAST
TO SEE HER, WEREN'T YOU?

175
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:30,404
EXCUSE ME?

176
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:31,612
YOUR NUMBER WAS
THE LAST ONE SHE TEXTED.

177
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:32,947
UH, WHO THE HELL
ARE YOU?

178
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,115
WAIT. IS SOMETHING WRONG
WITH BIANCA?

179
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:35,325
I DON'T KNOW. YOU TELL US.

180
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:36,826
AH...

181
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:40,914
YOU CAN'T JUST
CRASH MY PARTY
AND HARASS MY GUESTS.

182
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,416
DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM?

183
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:44,000
A LOT MORE THAN YOU DO.

184
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:45,960
WE WERE FRIENDS
OF YOUR PARENTS.

185
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,213
THEN HOW COME I'VE
NEVER SEEN EITHER
OF YOU BEFORE?

186
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:50,549
LONG STORY AND LESS THAN
ZERO TIME TO EXPLAIN.

187
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,300
YOUR FRIEND BIANCA,
SHE'S IN TROUBLE.

188
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:54,219
AND WE NEED YOUR HELP
TO FIND HER.

189
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:56,679
YEAH. I'M CALLING SECURITY.

190
00:09:56,721 --> 00:10:00,350
OH. I'M SORRY TO TAKE
YOU OUT OF YOUR BUBBLE,

191
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:02,394
BUT WE REALLY NEED YOU.

192
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,859
VOICE OF MIA: I KNOW
HOW TO PROTECT MYSELF.

193
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:12,070
-YOU MADE SURE OF THAT.
-I SURE DID.

194
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:14,364
FELICITY: THE 4 OF YOU ARE
THE HEROES THAT THE CITY NEEDS.

195
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:15,532
HYAH!

196
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:20,078
WILLIAM: WE ARE STARING
AT OUR FATHER ALIVE!

197
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,206
MIA: DAD. SO WHAT'S NEXT?

198
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:25,333
OLIVER: MAR NOVU HAS
SEEN MY FATE.

199
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:28,169
-DAD...
-I DON'T SURVIVE CRISIS.

200
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:35,594
JJ: MIA.

201
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,471
[METAL WEAPON SLASHES]

202
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:43,684
MIA: BACK OFF.
JJ: UM, I'M SORRY. YOU FAINTED.

203
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,158
WILLIAM: ARE YOU OK?

204
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,243
OH, MY GOD.

205
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:06,333
SORRY. UH, SORRY. I...I GUESS
I HAD TOO MUCH TO DRINK

206
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,042
WITHOUT EATING OR SOMETHING.

207
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,044
MAYBE YOU SHOULD LIE DOWN,
PARTY ANIMAL.

208
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,754
THINK I NEED SOME AIR.

209
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:15,674
-HEY, MIA, LISTEN...
-OOH. NO.

210
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,773
WHAT THE HELL DID
YOU DO TO ME?

211
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:33,151
I WOULD LOVE TO KNOW THAT
MYSELF.

212
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,111
THERE'S THIS GUY,
J'ONN J'ONZZ.

213
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:37,071
HE'S A MARTIAN OR SOMETHING.

214
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,907
HE'S WHY WE REMEMBER
EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED
BEFORE THE CRISIS.

215
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,493
CISCO WAS ABLE TO REPLICATE

216
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:44,078
THE MARTIAN'S POWERS
USING TECH.

217
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,331
DINAH: SO A FRIEND OF
SUPERGIRL'S HAS A POWER

218
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:47,957
A FRIEND OF THE FLASH
CAN REPLICATE.

219
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:50,168
YEAH. THAT'S
WHAT I SAID.

220
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,794
MIA: I WANT TO SAY THAT
YOU GUYS ARE CRAZY

221
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,547
AND THAT NONE OF THIS
IS POSSIBLE,

222
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:55,507
BUT I KNOW YOU'RE RIGHT.

223
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:57,800
I REMEMBER EVERYTHING,

224
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,927
YOU TWO FIGHTING
ALONGSIDE MY DAD,

225
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:03,056
ZOE DYING, MY...

226
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,099
MY FIANCE KILLING HER.

227
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:10,522
I REMEMBER
MY FATHER DYING.

228
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,485
WHY WOULD YOU DO
THIS TO ME?

229
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:17,529
LOOK, THERE'LL BE TIME
FOR EMOTIONS LATER.

230
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:19,864
I WOKE YOU UP BECAUSE
YOUR FRIEND BIANCA
WAS KIDNAPPED.

231
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:22,283
THERE HASN'T BEEN ANY
CRIME IN STAR CITY
IN 20 YEARS.

232
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:24,202
WHAT IS THAT, LIKE
THE CITY'S MOTTO NOW?

233
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,287
YOU DON'T KNOW BIANCA,
ALL RIGHT?

234
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:28,956
SHE'S FLAKY.
SHE'S PROBABLY ON A BEACH
SOMEWHERE HAVING A BALL.

235
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,417
I SAW HER, AND SHE
WAS TAKEN.

236
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,043
HOW ARE YOU EVEN
HESITATING?

237
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:33,878
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED
TO BE THE GREEN ARROW?

238
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:36,590
NOT ANYMORE.

239
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:37,756
DINAH: MIA, I UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU ARE TORN

240
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,259
BETWEEN TWO WORLDS
RIGHT NOW,

241
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,594
BUT WE NEED YOUR HELP.

242
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:42,053
LOOK, I DON'T EVEN KNOW

243
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,555
IF I CAN DO THIS ANYMORE, OK?

244
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:45,181
I HAVEN'T TRAINED. I DON'T...

245
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,353
SEE? JUST LIKE
RIDING A BIKE.

246
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:54,941
IS BIANCA ACTUALLY
IN TROUBLE?

247
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:57,652
DINAH: YES. AND IF WE DON'T
FIND HER, SHE'S GOING TO DIE.

248
00:12:57,694 --> 00:13:00,988
FINE. I WILL HELP YOU.

249
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:04,200
BUT THIS IS
A ONE-TIME THING, OK?

250
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:05,910
I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN JOINING

251
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:06,994
YOUR CANARY CLUB, ALL RIGHT?

252
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:09,247
I HAVE A LIFE NOW,
I AM HAPPY,

253
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:10,749
AND I WOULD LIKE TO
KEEP IT THAT WAY.

254
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:11,916
WHATEVER.

255
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,418
WELL, WHERE WAS BIANCA
WHEN SHE WAS TAKEN?

256
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,044
PARTYING AT CLUB V.

257
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:17,838
NOTHING BIANCA LOVED MORE
THAN A GOOD PARTY.

258
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,424
OH, TO BE IN MY
20S AGAIN.

259
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:22,801
ICK. HARD PASS.
I WAS MARRIED AT 21.

260
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:25,888
SERIOUSLY?
WHO ARE YOU?

261
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,349
BIANCA.
SHE WAS ADOPTED.

262
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:30,017
ANY CHANCE THAT
CREATED TENSION?

263
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,687
HELENA WAS A GREAT MOM
BEFORE SHE DISAPPEARED.

264
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,773
SHE LIVES WITH HER
GREAT-AUNT AND UNCLE NOW.

265
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:36,650
BACK IN THE OLD STAR CITY,
THE BERTINELLIS WERE

266
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:38,401
ONE OF THE BIGGEST
CRIME FAMILIES AROUND.

267
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:40,194
WELL, THAT SOUNDS
LIKE ENOUGH REASON

268
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,238
TO VIOLATE SOME
PRIVACY LAWS.

269
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,449
IT'S TIME FOR YOU

270
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:46,951
TO PAY THAT FAMILY
A LITTLE VISIT.

271
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,456
I'M SORRY BIANCA
MISSED YOUR PARTY.

272
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:53,124
YOU KNOW HOW SHE IS.

273
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,751
FREE SPIRIT.

274
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:56,377
TOTALLY. ACTUALLY,

275
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:59,547
I WANTED TO SPEAK
WITH YOU ABOUT THAT.

276
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:02,133
I THINK BIANCA MIGHT BE
IN SOME KIND OF TROUBLE.

277
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:03,593
WHAT KIND OF TROUBLE?

278
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:06,929
MIA'S IN POSITION.
D, YOU'RE UP.

279
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,599
-YOU READY?
-NEVER NOT.

280
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:11,309
I THINK BIANCA MIGHT
HAVE BEEN TAKEN.

281
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,353
MR. BERTINELLI: HA HA!
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

282
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,313
YOU KNOW HOW SAFE IT IS HERE.

283
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:16,815
I HAVEN'T BEEN
ABLE TO CONTACT
HER IN DAYS.

284
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:18,483
HER SOCIAL MEDIA IS QUIET,

285
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:19,942
AND SHE'S NOT EVEN
POSTING THOSE VIDEOS

286
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,361
SHE'S ALWAYS
ADDICTED TO MAKING.

287
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:22,862
I WOULDN'T WORRY
ABOUT IT.

288
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:24,197
IN A COUPLE DAYS,
WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT

289
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:25,699
SHE'S BEEN, UH,
WHAT PARTYING

290
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,450
OFF THE COAST OF
CORTO MALTESE OR SOMETHING.

291
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:29,828
LAUREL, OVER COMMS: DINAH,
WHAT'S YOUR PROGRESS?

292
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,371
3 MORE ROOMS TO GO.

293
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:33,540
YOU'RE ABOUT TO
HAVE COMPANY,

294
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,750
ONE OF THE HELP,
I'M GUESSING.

295
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:39,045
MIA, WE NEED A DISTRACTION.

296
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:41,422
WOULDN'T IT BE BETTER
TO BE SAFE THAN SORRY?

297
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:43,466
I MEAN, MAYBE SINCE
WE'RE HERE,

298
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:46,010
IF WE CALL THE POLICE...
OH, MY GOD! I'M SO SORRY.

299
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,512
MR. BERTINELLI: GET REMY!

300
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:48,722
BOY: REMY?

301
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,477
REMY, WE'VE GOT
AN EMERGENCY.

302
00:14:57,438 --> 00:15:00,692
MR. BERTINELLI: DO US A FAVOR.
STOP WORRYING ABOUT BIANCA.

303
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:02,151
SHE'S FINE.

304
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:03,611
OK, I WILL.

305
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:05,405
[OVER COMMS]
I'M CLEAR. PLEASE TELL ME

306
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:06,823
YOU GOT THOSE EYES
AND EARS PLACED.

307
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:08,199
ALL OF THEM.

308
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:09,701
WE CAN SEE AND HEAR
EVERYTHING

309
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:11,202
THAT GOES DOWN IN
THAT HOUSE.

310
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,079
MIA: GOOD. I'LL MEET YOU
AT THE BAR.

311
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,873
I WANT TO TALK TO BIANCA'S
