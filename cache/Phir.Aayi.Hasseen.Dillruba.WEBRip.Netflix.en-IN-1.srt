1
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:46,250
Help.

2
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:49,875
Help.

3
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:52,541
Help!

4
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:55,041
My husband will kill me!

5
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,958
Please save me! My husband will kill me.

6
00:01:59,041 --> 00:01:59,958
Please.

7
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:10,041
TWO MONTHS AGO

8
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,041
Breaking news!

9
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:16,875
First on Visphotak News!

10
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:20,500
In Haryana, the Hathinikund Barrage
on the Yamuna River

11
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:23,166
has collapsed due to heavy rains.

12
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,416
As a result, many crocodiles have entered

13
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,625
the low-lying areas of Agra,
along with the floodwaters.

14
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:33,625
Help me get down. My legs hurt. Come here.

15
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:36,250
-Hold me.
-This is Sharad Pathak,

16
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:38,208
bringing exclusively on Visphotak News!

17
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:41,125
Crocodiles have swarmed Agra!

18
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:42,500
Madam.

19
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:45,458
It's time for your insulin injection.

20
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:46,458
You're here?

21
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,125
So many tomatoes?

22
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:53,208
I got them for cheap, that's why--

23
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:55,708
-Looking nice, aren't I?
-I bought some for you.

24
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:05,083
Please manage this once.

25
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:07,000
I promise, after two days--

26
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:09,833
I'll help you out.

27
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,375
I filled in for you yesterday.

28
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:24,958
What?

29
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:28,000
She canceled the five-hour
bridal makeup appointment?

30
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,458
I could've serviced five clients
in that time!

31
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:32,666
Sorry, they fell.

32
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,750
No problem.

33
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:34,875
She booked Seema instead?

34
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:41,500
Rani's bridal makeup
lasts for a whole month!

35
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:43,875
Seema's brides start looking ghastly

36
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:46,250
even before the ceremony ends!

37
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:47,625
Next time she comes,

38
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:49,166
no way will I give her a discount!

39
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,583
She didn't even return
my lipstick last time!

40
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:57,000
In her hurry,
Rani has left her Molly and Polly behind.

41
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:00,125
Should I go and give them to her?

42
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:01,875
Sure.

43
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:09,750
One minute.

44
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,708
Let's go.

45
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:14,250
Rani ji!

46
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:15,583
Take me to Belanganj.

47
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,541
Rani ji! Your heads…

48
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:19,458
Rani ji!

49
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:22,500
Wait up.

50
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:28,000
Not fair.

51
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:31,083
I'll have to work overtime now.

52
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:35,375
Yes, but…

53
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:42,708
Rani ji!

54
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:46,875
Rani ji. Wait!

55
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:49,208
That's it. Please pull over.

56
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:54,583
Here you go.

57
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:00,541
Rani ji.

58
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:03,375
You forgot to take these.

59
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:05,958
Thank you. Thank you so much!

60
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,750
Did you come all the way
to give these to me?

61
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:11,750
No.

62
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:14,500
I was coming here anyway…

63
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:17,000
QADER SHROUD STORE

64
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,166
For my patient.

65
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:23,875
You seem to care a lot
about your patients.

66
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,208
Yes.

67
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:28,125
Thank you.

68
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:31,125
-Rani ji.
-Yes?

69
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:35,083
-I…
-Rani, come here quick!

70
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,791
Yes.

71
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:38,791
I'll be back in two minutes.

72
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:40,750
-No problem.
-Two minutes. Okay?

73
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:45,541
Rani, I messed up!

74
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:47,375
Mrs. Sahay had asked for Dirty Blonde,

75
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:48,916
but I applied Slutty Red by mistake!

76
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,000
Let me see.

77
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:54,041
I told you not to start without me!

78
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:55,541
Hi, Mrs. Sahay.

79
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:58,333
-Rani?
-No! Don't take these off.

80
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:00,333
It'll brighten the color.

81
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:02,000
How are you?

82
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,916
-A cup of tea.
-Sure.

83
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,416
I'll add another layer.

84
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,541
Okay.

85
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:07,750
I hope you're not in a hurry.

86
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:13,666
Dirty Blonde is the best color.

87
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,375
It takes a little longer.

88
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,541
Wash it off in ten minutes.

89
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:48,250
Rani ji…

90
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:51,708
I was thinking…

91
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:52,833
Excuse me?

92
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,541
Will you come for a movie with me?

93
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:01,208
What?

94
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:03,291
Friday?

95
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,083
Six o'clock?

96
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:17,375
-Right.
-Okay.

97
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:21,708
Once there lived a damsel

98
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:26,208
And her crazy lover

99
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:33,541
It was a magical time and age

100
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:43,375
After they met one day

101
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:47,625
They started meeting everyday

102
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:51,916
Then they fell in love

103
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,791
It was a catastrophe

104
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:59,125
Where did you lose yourself

105
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:03,500
While listening to this story?

106
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,125
People are surprised

107
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:07,833
Because they are unfamiliar

108
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:14,916
With the path that love takes

109
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:22,708
I used to be familiar with those paths

110
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,416
Once there lived a damsel

111
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:32,333
And her crazy lover

112
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:39,416
It was a magical time and age

113
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:43,375
Once there lived a damsel

114
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:48,375
And her crazy lover

115
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:54,625
Rishu and I had done
some crazy things for love.

116
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:57,875
Rishu is now Ravi.

117
00:08:57,958 --> 00:08:59,750
Now, here we are,

118
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,750
standing on opposite banks
of this river of love.

119
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:05,791
Between us stands
the Uttar Pradesh police.

120
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:08,208
And we're still trying to figure out

121
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:10,791
a way to be united forever.

122
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:14,458
If love doesn't push you
to the brink of insanity,

123
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:16,083
it's not true love.

124
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:19,958
Only the meek seek refuge
in passionless relationships.

125
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:38,375
Jaipur!

126
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:43,000
Watch your step! Over here, mister!

127
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,500
Guddu ji, here's the 25,000

128
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:48,250
that you asked for.

129
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:50,583
Good.

130
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,250
Your job will be done.

131
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:55,916
You'll be in Thailand in two months.

132
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,958
Two months?

133
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:58,500
Yes, it'll take two months.

134
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,333
I'll let you know the exact date.

135
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:10,083
You'll see that velocity
remains constant--

136
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:13,375
What's going on?

137
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:14,750
Pay attention here.

138
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:15,708
Yes, sir.

139
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,541
So the velocity of--

140
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,125
Note this down.

141
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:02,958
When will you give it, Ravi?

142
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:05,666
But I've already paid my rent.

143
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:12,208
When will you answer my questions?

144
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,166
What was that song…

145
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:24,708
All I need is a lover

146
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:27,541
For my passion

147
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,291
Poonam, after my wife--

148
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:35,000
Ravi, you've lost your wife,

149
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:36,333
not your life.

150
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,416
Anyway, I'm not talking
about the emotional kind of love.

151
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:44,916
I just…

152
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:48,541
want to have some fun.

153
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,666
Sorry.

154
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:00,625
I'm not feeling well today.

155
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:01,541
No problem.

156
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:04,458
You'll recover soon.

157
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:07,125
I'll be back then.

158
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:19,375
All I need is a lover

159
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:22,125
For my passion

160
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:38,000
Yes?

161
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:58,041
Uncle and Auntie are away
at the Agra Masala Convention.

162
00:12:58,125 --> 00:12:59,333
Masala Convention?

163
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,375
Stop acting like an innocent rabbit.

164
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:05,791
My point is, there's no one at home.
So will you come over?

165
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:10,458
It seems difficult today.

166
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:11,916
Fine!

167
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,375
Come over with sweets on Rakshabandhan!

168
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:19,041
When will we get out of this place, Rishu?

169
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:21,625
How much longer?

170
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:22,916
Everything is set.

171
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,041
The agent has our passports ready.

172
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:26,583
It's just a matter of one month

173
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,333
and we'll be in Thailand making mad love.

174
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:34,000
Just make sure you're not ravished
by your admirers by then.

175
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:36,291
And what about your medical
compounder admirer?

176
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:40,541
It's not lust. The poor guy is in love.

177
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:43,000
He's a good man.

178
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:46,916
But your character is questionable.

179
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,083
Dinesh Pandit writes,

180
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:57,250
"Judge a lover not by his behavior,

181
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:01,000
but only by the depth of his feelings."

182
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:03,708
I want tickets for the 6:00 p.m. show.

183
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:04,791
How many?

184
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:05,958
All of them.

185
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:37,833
Rani…

186
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,791
Sorry! Careful!

187
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:56,708
Let me.

188
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:19,666
Move aside.

189
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:31,833
Streets of Agra turn deadly!

190
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:35,416
A crocodile was spotted outside
Aslam's tailoring shop.

191
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,041
I'm doing a root touchup now.

192
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:40,958
Keep it on for 30 minutes
and then wash it off.

193
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,416
Okay.

194
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,541
Abhimanyu?

195
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:48,250
At this hour?

196
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,875
More tomatoes?

197
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:53,208
They were being sold cheaply
outside the Royal Cinema.

198
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:56,791
Thought I'd bring you some.

199
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:00,250
Shit!

200
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:02,458
I'm sorry.

201
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:05,416
Abhimanyu, I'm so sorry!

202
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,708
It's okay, Rani ji.

203
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,541
I'm sure something important came up.

204
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,750
Wait. So sorry…

205
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:16,041
-Take this--
-Can we try again next Friday?

206
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,125
I'll be waiting.

207
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:20,541
Again?

208
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:25,541
Waiting is easy because I can do it alone.

209
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,583
It's the meeting I dread

210
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,291
because you'll also need to be there.

211
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:35,125
Right.

212
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,166
Don't laugh.

213
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:41,208
I'm feeling bad for him.

214
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:51,666
Rani ji, you've killed
so many of your lovers.

215
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:54,208
Even the bodies of some weren't found.

216
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,666
Don't be over-smart--

217
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,791
Thief!

218
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,291
Thief!

219
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,166
Run!

220
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:21,541
Thief!

221
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:23,291
Stop!

222
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:25,958
Stop!

223
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:34,458
Oh no!

224
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:48,375
Yes?

225
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:50,625
Does Rani Kashyap live here?

226
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:53,333
I was told she lives here.

227
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:55,208
Yes, she does.

228
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:57,041
She's a good woman.

229
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:58,458
Poor thing is a widow.

230
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:00,166
She has no one.

231
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:01,541
She rents a room in my house.

232
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:03,000
We've found her purse.

233
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:05,208
I'll call her.

234
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:06,625
Rani!

235
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,666
Yes?

236
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:14,541
Coming.

237
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:25,375
So you've finally found

238
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:27,708
the purse-snatcher.

239
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:30,583
We meet again, Rani ji.

240
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:32,791
Destiny.

241
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:36,291
Even God must be waiting for justice.

242
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:42,208
Hasn't Dinesh Pandit
written something similar

243
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:45,958
in the novel Wrath of Kasauli?

244
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:47,291
I've read it.

245
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:49,833
It has a fantastic climax.

246
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:51,208
Hero pretended to be dead.

247
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:54,375
He cut off his hand
and kept it on the dead body

248
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:56,750
to save his lover.

249
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:03,125
Thank you.

250
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:04,541
I heard…

251
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:07,708
someone is looking for you.

252
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,500
Who?

253
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:12,750
The past.

254
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:13,791
Your past.

255
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,916
He has read Wrath of Kasauli, Rishu.

256
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:28,083
He said the climax was good

257
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:29,750
and that someone was looking for us.

258
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:31,166
He knows everything.

259
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,458
He has no evidence. Just a story.

260
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:35,458
He's just trying to scare you.

261
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:42,416
Told you to leave. Why are you back?

262
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,333
Were you missing me?

263
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:47,458
We met just this morning.

264
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:48,833
Did you forget already?

265
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:51,625
We spent so much time talking
this morning.

266
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:06,250
Just two Indians sitting
and exchanging stories.

267
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,791
The number you have called

268
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:54,625
is out of network coverage area.

269
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:20,625
To Husanpura.

270
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,333
Why have you parked here?

271
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:31,541
It stinks here.

272
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:33,041
My customers are complaining.

273
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:34,750
Please move the vehicle.

274
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:36,416
Okay, I'm leaving.

275
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,666
I already gave you the trash.

276
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:38,625
Leave!

277
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:40,500
I'm leaving.

278
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,875
"When our hearts will beat as one,

279
00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:46,625
all the battles will be won."

280
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,166
Wait a minute! Wait…

281
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:51,333
These lines…

282
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,333
Are you a fan of Dinesh Pandit?

283
00:22:53,416 --> 00:22:54,583
These lines?

284
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:58,791
Some crazy man wrote these
and paid me to stand here for an hour.

285
00:22:58,875 --> 00:23:00,291
Is it something bad?

286
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,083
BATTLE OF THE HEARTS

287
00:23:34,791 --> 00:23:37,416
"Even though I tried to stop myself
from talking to you,

288
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,791
I couldn't stay firm, my helplessness won.

289
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:45,375
Archana knew where her lover
would be waiting."

290
00:23:50,791 --> 00:23:55,125
Mister, may I please make a call?

291
00:23:55,208 --> 00:23:56,416
Sure.

292
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:12,958
-Rishu?
-Rani.

293
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:14,541
Rishu, are you okay?

294
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:16,125
I am fine.

295
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:20,166
Listen, I just met the agent,
we'll leave next week.

296
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:24,250
Rishu, the police are after me.

297
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:26,250
They're following me everywhere I go.

298
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:27,583
Listen to me, Rani.

299
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:29,666
It's your fear that's standing

300
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,666
between our freedom and getting jailed.

301
00:24:32,875 --> 00:24:34,208
Inspector Kishore has no evidence.

302
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:38,250
If you get scared,
he'll find what he's looking for.

303
00:24:39,583 --> 00:24:43,125
The police might call you in
for questioning.

304
00:24:43,708 --> 00:24:44,833
Be brave.

305
00:24:46,416 --> 00:24:47,375
Rishu.

306
00:24:47,458 --> 00:24:48,291
Hello?

307
00:24:48,375 --> 00:24:49,958
Rishu?

308
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,125
Hello.

309
00:25:09,458 --> 00:25:10,666
Okay.

310
00:25:14,666 --> 00:25:19,208
POLICE STATION, AGRA

311
00:25:19,291 --> 00:25:22,375
POLICE STATION, AGRA

312
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:28,166
Hurry up, you scoundrel!

313
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:29,958
Get in the car.

314
00:25:45,041 --> 00:25:46,750
Naitik Verma.

315
00:25:49,166 --> 00:25:50,125
Is he a lover?

316
00:25:50,958 --> 00:25:52,208
Or a friend?

317
00:25:56,541 --> 00:25:57,833
Why?

318
00:25:57,916 --> 00:26:01,000
Because you speak to him for hours.

319
00:26:01,916 --> 00:26:04,750
I thought he's my friend.

320
00:26:05,375 --> 00:26:07,625
He said his name is Rahul.

321
00:26:07,708 --> 00:26:10,958
One day, a woman called me
and said he's her husband.

322
00:26:11,041 --> 00:26:13,125
Our friendship ended.

323
00:26:14,291 --> 00:26:16,458
In this day and age, Inspector,

324
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:20,958
can we really claim to know anyone?

325
00:26:22,416 --> 00:26:25,458
I'm sure you know
an acquaintance isn't always a friend.

326
00:26:27,375 --> 00:26:31,041
I won't fall
for your stories anymore, madam.

327
00:26:32,833 --> 00:26:33,958
Pandit writes…

328
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:41,541
There you go, quoting Pandit again.

329
00:26:41,625 --> 00:26:42,833
I had to.

330
00:26:43,916 --> 00:26:47,125
Because 30 years ago,
in a police station similar to this,

331
00:26:47,208 --> 00:26:49,875
he was insulted and fired from his job.

332
00:26:51,041 --> 00:26:54,791
Ever since, he has been taking revenge
through his stories.

333
00:26:56,083 --> 00:26:59,375
The police are defeated at the end
of every story he writes.

334
00:26:59,458 --> 00:27:00,708
Salute, sir.

335
00:27:00,791 --> 00:27:04,250
Maybe not through his actions,
but through his writing,

336
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:05,333
he did take revenge.

337
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:18,875
Rumour has it, even after passing away,

338
00:27:22,791 --> 00:27:25,375
Dinesh Pandit's novels
are still being published.

339
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,291
My name is Mrityunjay Paswan.

340
00:28:18,791 --> 00:28:20,708
I don't think you've recognized me.

341
00:28:21,875 --> 00:28:23,125
We're related.

342
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:30,875
Looks like you have a poor memory.

343
00:28:37,541 --> 00:28:40,000
In detail,

344
00:28:40,083 --> 00:28:41,750
I'm Rishu's mom's sister's husband's

345
00:28:41,833 --> 00:28:43,500
sister's husband's…

346
00:28:44,291 --> 00:28:45,208
brother.

347
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,916
That means…

348
00:28:54,583 --> 00:28:56,375
I'm Neel's uncle.

349
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:11,000
To you, Neel was Rishu's distant cousin.

350
00:29:12,541 --> 00:29:17,291
But he was very dear to me.

351
00:29:18,583 --> 00:29:22,083
My dear nephew.

352
00:29:27,958 --> 00:29:29,000
By the way…

353
00:29:31,083 --> 00:29:34,583
I had danced a lot at your wedding

354
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:37,458
and enjoyed myself.

355
00:29:50,625 --> 00:29:54,583
Inspector Kishore is my friend.

356
00:29:56,166 --> 00:29:58,958
He asked me to lead this case.

357
00:30:01,583 --> 00:30:03,166
So…

358
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,291
I will be asking the questions now.

359
00:30:08,625 --> 00:30:11,291
Because it's personal.

360
00:30:15,708 --> 00:30:20,000
So tell me,
this friend of yours, Naitik ji…

361
00:30:21,333 --> 00:30:22,666
Rahul ji…

362
00:30:23,375 --> 00:30:27,416
why does he call
a travel agent every week?

363
00:30:29,458 --> 00:30:32,458
He probably likes to travel.
How would I know?

364
00:30:32,541 --> 00:30:36,541
And what are you doing here
all alone in Agra?

365
00:30:41,166 --> 00:30:43,333
Rani ji, isn't it strange?

366
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,833
It has been some time
since Rishu passed away.

367
00:30:47,916 --> 00:30:50,833
You've broken ties with your family

368
00:30:51,833 --> 00:30:53,500
and you haven't even remarried.

369
00:30:54,416 --> 00:30:57,625
Is it a crime if a widow doesn't remarry?

370
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,208
Will you lodge an FIR
or arrest me straightaway?

371
00:31:02,291 --> 00:31:04,916
-What are you trying to say?
-I'm saying that

372
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,500
Rishu is right here in Agra with you!

373
00:31:08,625 --> 00:31:13,250
Otherwise, you couldn't have stayed here
without any friends or relatives!

374
00:31:18,083 --> 00:31:19,041
Sorry.

375
00:31:21,625 --> 00:31:23,541
I also mean to say…

376
00:31:25,041 --> 00:31:28,041
I've known Rishu since he was in diapers.

377
00:31:28,708 --> 00:31:33,666
He is far more cunning than he seems.

378
00:31:35,083 --> 00:31:36,916
I'm a modern independent woman.

379
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,125
I'm capable of living alone.

380
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:47,750
Rani ji, in the department,

381
00:31:48,583 --> 00:31:50,458
I'm known by many names.

382
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,833
But my favorite one is "Woodpecker".

383
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:00,041
Woodpecker.

384
00:32:01,166 --> 00:32:02,291
Do you know why?

385
00:32:02,875 --> 00:32:09,666
Because until a woodpecker manages
to peck a hole in a tree,

386
00:32:10,583 --> 00:32:11,791
it doesn't stop.

387
00:32:14,458 --> 00:32:21,041
Even the law doesn't interfere
in my cases.

388
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:27,625
Okay.

389
00:32:29,666 --> 00:32:30,541
You may leave.

390
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,875
Rani ji.

391
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,458
When you meet Rishu, tell him

392
00:32:44,208 --> 00:32:46,208
that Uncle Montu is here now.

393
00:33:06,458 --> 00:33:09,541
The team that was following her.

394
00:33:10,958 --> 00:33:12,166
Did they find anything?

395
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:13,791
Not yet.

396
00:33:13,875 --> 00:33:16,166
But our force is spread out
all over Agra, sir.

397
00:33:18,291 --> 00:33:22,208
Which are the places
the madam visits regularly?

398
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:24,875
Just her home and the beauty parlor,

399
00:33:24,958 --> 00:33:26,875
all within a radius of two kilometers.

400
00:33:30,333 --> 00:33:33,708
Then keep your force
within these two kilometers.

401
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:38,166
We'll find Rishu within a week.

402
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:40,958
Okay, sir.

403
00:33:49,208 --> 00:33:50,125
Have you seen him?

404
00:33:50,208 --> 00:33:52,458
POLICE STATION, BELANGANJ

405
00:33:54,416 --> 00:33:56,041
Have you seen this man?

406
00:33:56,625 --> 00:33:57,708
-Seen him?
-Sir…

407
00:33:57,791 --> 00:33:59,958
Look properly.
You must have seen him somewhere.

408
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:04,958
-Seen him? Ask him.
-No, sir.

409
00:34:06,791 --> 00:34:08,208
Don't know?

410
00:34:09,333 --> 00:34:10,208
Done.

411
00:34:41,208 --> 00:34:42,750
Please hear me out!

412
00:34:42,833 --> 00:34:44,083
I'm innocent, sir.

413
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:49,125
-I have kids at home! I did nothing!
-Move.

414
00:35:11,083 --> 00:35:13,083
That's ridiculous!

415
00:35:13,166 --> 00:35:15,083
Your child told me,

416
00:35:15,166 --> 00:35:16,666
"Mom doesn't help me with my studies.

417
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:18,541
She's always on her phone
watching her shows."

418
00:35:20,166 --> 00:35:21,708
I'll talk to you later.

419
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:31,041
Have you seen this man?

420
00:35:38,083 --> 00:35:39,458
I'll be back in two minutes.

421
00:35:40,833 --> 00:35:42,000
Would you like some tea?

422
00:35:42,083 --> 00:35:43,166
-No.
-Yes.

423
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,666
Three teaspoons of sugar.

424
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:49,291
Sure.

425
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:56,583
Have you heard about blood sugar?

426
00:35:56,666 --> 00:35:59,041
Yes! So I only asked for three teaspoons.

427
00:36:11,583 --> 00:36:12,791
Ravi?

428
00:36:26,458 --> 00:36:27,916
The police are here.

429
00:36:31,833 --> 00:36:34,750
They asked me if I'd seen this man.

430
00:36:39,458 --> 00:36:40,750
I haven't, right?

431
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,958
I'll tell them.

432
00:37:01,208 --> 00:37:02,833
Sorry, sir. I haven't seen him.

433
00:37:13,375 --> 00:37:16,791
Aren't you getting the tea, madam?

434
00:37:19,583 --> 00:37:20,541
Aren't you ashamed

435
00:37:21,875 --> 00:37:23,791
of asking a handicapped girl
to make tea for you?

436
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,625
Get lost!

437
00:37:25,708 --> 00:37:27,458
Get a warrant if you want tea next time.

438
00:37:27,541 --> 00:37:28,416
Out!

439
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,666
Rani.

440
00:37:57,958 --> 00:37:59,625
Rishu, no! Everyone is home.

441
00:37:59,708 --> 00:38:01,708
-Listen to me--
-No, you listen.

442
00:38:01,791 --> 00:38:03,416
There's a new officer at the station!

443
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,583
Uncle Montu. I know.

444
00:38:04,666 --> 00:38:06,166
-I'll tell you inside.
-Montu?

445
00:38:07,541 --> 00:38:08,541
Hold on.

446
00:38:17,125 --> 00:38:18,458
Everything is over, Rani.

447
00:38:19,708 --> 00:38:21,000
Everything.

448
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:22,750
Why?

449
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:24,208
He has arrested the travel agent.

450
00:38:26,375 --> 00:38:30,250
All our money and effort
have gone down the drain.

451
00:38:34,708 --> 00:38:36,708
The police even reached
the coaching center today.

452
00:38:38,125 --> 00:38:39,833
Poonam is also suspicious of me.

453
00:38:40,625 --> 00:38:41,916
I don't know what to do.

454
00:38:43,083 --> 00:38:44,916
-Let's run away.
-What?

455
00:38:45,958 --> 00:38:48,125
-Let us run away now.
-Rani.

456
00:38:48,208 --> 00:38:50,208
I have known Uncle Montu since childhood.

457
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:53,208
If we run away,

458
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:55,875
he will get a kick out of it.

459
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:59,708
Then he will chase us down and kill us.

460
00:38:59,791 --> 00:39:02,458
Uncle Montu? Neel?

461
00:39:02,541 --> 00:39:03,958
What kind of…

462
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:05,416
These relatives of yours!

463
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,541
We don't have any option, Rani!

464
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:11,125
I'll surrender

465
00:39:11,208 --> 00:39:14,416
and tell the police that you had nothing
to do with Neel's death.

466
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,041
Have you lost your mind?

467
00:39:16,708 --> 00:39:18,416
Have you lost your mind completely?

468
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:21,458
Did we flee from Jwalapur and come here
only to surrender?

469
00:39:22,041 --> 00:39:23,583
You've chopped your hand off
for us, Rishu!

470
00:39:23,666 --> 00:39:25,708
Try to understand, Rani.

471
00:39:25,791 --> 00:39:27,708
-Please.
-What brings you here?

472
00:39:30,291 --> 00:39:31,416
Hold on.

473
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,291
Is Rani ji here?

474
00:39:42,166 --> 00:39:43,541
Rani!

475
00:39:59,458 --> 00:40:00,500
Rani.

476
00:40:06,583 --> 00:40:08,541
I'll go to another city.

477
00:40:08,625 --> 00:40:12,000
The police will soon track me down
and arrest me.

478
00:40:12,708 --> 00:40:14,166
-Far from here.
-Quiet.

479
00:40:15,333 --> 00:40:17,708
You're afraid Uncle Montu thinks
we're still together?

480
00:40:20,458 --> 00:40:21,791
I have a better idea.

481
00:40:23,541 --> 00:40:24,666
You trust me, don't you?

482
00:40:46,791 --> 00:40:49,041
I thought you would keep me waiting
once again

483
00:40:50,041 --> 00:40:52,250
and I'd have to go to your house
to meet you.

484
00:40:55,666 --> 00:40:57,750
You won't have to wait any longer.

485
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,625
Will you marry me?

486
00:41:03,083 --> 00:41:03,958
Excuse me?

487
00:41:06,791 --> 00:41:08,291
Will you marry me?

488
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,833
Marriage straightaway?

489
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:14,625
What about love?

490
00:41:20,541 --> 00:41:22,500
I don't have the courage to love again.

491
00:41:24,291 --> 00:41:26,041
I waited for you for hours,

492
00:41:26,916 --> 00:41:28,791
but you never noticed me.

493
00:41:30,166 --> 00:41:31,083
Then why choose me?

494
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:35,041
A patient lover, who spends time on you,

495
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:38,125
is worthy of spending an entire life with…

496
00:41:38,916 --> 00:41:40,083
And who knows

497
00:41:40,833 --> 00:41:42,208
love…

498
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:43,541
might happen after marriage.

499
00:41:44,708 --> 00:41:47,500
Or it might not.

500
00:41:58,583 --> 00:41:59,916
Wow, Rani ji…

501
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:05,625
You offered me my dream world and then
destroyed it, in the same instant.

502
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,500
This is what love is, Abhimanyu.

503
00:42:10,875 --> 00:42:13,833
It can revive us and also ruin us.

504
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,875
If I'd known love was this cruel,
I wouldn't have fallen in love.

505
00:42:27,166 --> 00:42:28,458
But it's too late now.

506
00:42:40,208 --> 00:42:42,208
"We shall meet, says the soothsayer.

507
00:42:42,291 --> 00:42:45,666
As I recite your name like a prayer."

508
00:43:20,541 --> 00:43:21,625
Don't do it, Rani.

509
00:43:23,291 --> 00:43:24,708
I don't think this is a good plan.

510
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:29,250
If Rani and Rishu aren't together,

511
00:43:30,208 --> 00:43:32,416
Uncle Montu will stop hounding us.

512
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:33,708
End of story.

513
00:43:39,666 --> 00:43:41,166
Reminds me of something Pandit wrote.

514
00:43:43,791 --> 00:43:45,333
"I'll agree to everything you say.

515
00:43:46,333 --> 00:43:49,875
Just don't let a third person come
between us."

516
00:43:51,625 --> 00:43:53,916
And look! A third person is here already!

517
00:43:58,291 --> 00:44:00,541
We're going the wrong way in life, Rani.

518
00:44:02,291 --> 00:44:03,916
But I hope it's the right way for love…

519
00:44:06,583 --> 00:44:08,041
The wedding is in three days.

520
00:44:10,541 --> 00:44:11,541
Will you come?

521
00:44:22,833 --> 00:44:26,791
This deep bond between us

522
00:44:26,875 --> 00:44:30,791
Always brings a smile when we meet!

523
00:44:30,875 --> 00:44:34,583
I am so besotted by you

524
00:44:34,666 --> 00:44:38,291
That my eyes fill with tears of joy

525
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:42,041
I will bear this pain for you

526
00:44:42,125 --> 00:44:45,875
With a smile on my face

527
00:44:45,958 --> 00:44:49,375
I am so besotted by you

528
00:44:49,458 --> 00:44:53,375
That my eyes fill with tears of joy

529
00:44:53,458 --> 00:44:57,041
Joy and sorrow are sides of the same coin

530
00:44:57,125 --> 00:45:00,916
I hope these smiles don't lead to tears

531
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,583
I will bear this pain for you

532
00:45:04,666 --> 00:45:09,083
With a smile on my face

533
00:45:09,166 --> 00:45:10,166
What do you think?

534
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:12,458
Will Romeo come

535
00:45:13,208 --> 00:45:14,333
to his Juliet's wedding?

536
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:18,333
I know Rishu very well.

537
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:21,666
This love will lead to his downfall.

538
00:45:23,041 --> 00:45:25,666
And I'll be waiting, anyway, to nab him.

539
00:45:42,791 --> 00:45:46,208
Joy and sorrow are sides of the same coin

540
00:45:46,291 --> 00:45:53,125
I hope these smiles don t lead to tears

541
00:45:53,833 --> 00:45:55,625
I feel smothered

542
00:45:55,708 --> 00:46:02,416
Let me catch my breath, with a smile

543
00:46:03,125 --> 00:46:06,916
Who can I bare my secrets to?
Close friends are hard to find

544
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,625
I will bear this pain for you

545
00:46:11,708 --> 00:46:16,500
With a smile on my face

546
00:46:18,166 --> 00:46:21,625
I will bear this pain for you

547
00:46:22,208 --> 00:46:25,708
With a smile on my face

548
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:29,416
I am so besotted by you

549
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:33,208
That my eyes fill with tears of joy

550
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:36,833
Joy and sorrow are sides of the same coin

551
00:46:36,916 --> 00:46:40,666
I hope these smiles don t lead to tears

552
00:46:40,750 --> 00:46:44,291
I will bear this pain for you

553
00:46:44,375 --> 00:46:50,041
With a smile on my face

554
00:48:36,333 --> 00:48:38,583
Do you drink rum?

555
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:40,791
Excuse me?

556
00:48:42,666 --> 00:48:43,666
Sometimes.

557
00:48:45,166 --> 00:48:46,541
Do you have whisky?

558
00:48:49,625 --> 00:48:51,458
When I used to watch you from afar,

559
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,166
I had so much to tell you.

560
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,583
But now that you're here,
I am tongue tied…

561
00:48:58,625 --> 00:49:01,583
I'm under pressure to say something
to make you smile.

562
00:49:06,291 --> 00:49:07,708
Do you know of Dinesh Pandit?

563
00:49:14,958 --> 00:49:17,833
Before he met me,
Rishu didn't know of him either.

564
00:49:22,833 --> 00:49:24,125
There you go, bringing up Rishu.

565
00:49:25,291 --> 00:49:26,166
He is always here…

566
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,041
Fine.

567
00:49:51,666 --> 00:49:55,291
Let the three of us play a game
of Snakes and Ladders.

568
00:49:58,958 --> 00:50:00,875
Love happens between two people, Rani ji.

569
00:50:01,833 --> 00:50:04,458
If there are three, they only end up
playing Snakes and Ladders.

570
00:50:11,166 --> 00:50:12,125
Tell me something.

571
00:50:14,833 --> 00:50:16,000
Didn't you feel bad

572
00:50:17,291 --> 00:50:19,833
when I proposed a marriage of convenience?

573
00:50:20,833 --> 00:50:21,791
Didn't you feel bad?

574
00:50:23,791 --> 00:50:26,416
I mean, you must have wished
for something for yourself.

575
00:50:27,833 --> 00:50:34,583
Love, a lover, affection, et cetera.

576
00:50:34,666 --> 00:50:36,625
I was seven when I lost my parents.

577
00:50:40,458 --> 00:50:44,833
The only family I had left
was my uncle, aunt, and their children.

578
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:47,958
They passed away when I was 20.

579
00:50:48,583 --> 00:50:49,708
And all I was left with was

580
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:53,125
this house,

581
00:50:53,208 --> 00:50:55,291
these windows, this roof,

582
00:50:55,375 --> 00:50:56,666
and these walls.

583
00:50:57,916 --> 00:51:01,458
I did have a job
that I had no interest in.

584
00:51:03,583 --> 00:51:05,166
I was so lost

585
00:51:05,250 --> 00:51:08,750
I even tried to end my life.

586
00:51:11,625 --> 00:51:13,875
Then one day, you walked into the clinic…

587
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:17,416
in a sky-blue dupatta

588
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:18,958
and a pink kameez.

589
00:51:20,125 --> 00:51:22,833
I had never seen such colors.

590
00:51:24,166 --> 00:51:26,375
My world changed in that moment.

591
00:51:28,791 --> 00:51:30,583
The colors were so vibrant

592
00:51:30,666 --> 00:51:33,208
that the clinic, my house,
my neighborhood…

593
00:51:33,291 --> 00:51:34,458
Everything turned pink.

594
00:51:35,291 --> 00:51:38,666
The entire city!
Even the Taj Mahal I see from the rooftop.

595
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:39,750
That too…

596
00:51:41,416 --> 00:51:44,500
I'm willing to play
Snakes and Ladders all my life

597
00:51:44,583 --> 00:51:45,625
if that's what you want.

598
00:51:48,583 --> 00:51:49,791
Let's go.

599
00:51:58,541 --> 00:52:02,416
Your eyes and mine

600
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:07,041
Locked in a gaze

601
00:52:07,125 --> 00:52:11,291
Your dreams and mine

602
00:52:11,375 --> 00:52:15,583
Are so alike

603
00:52:15,666 --> 00:52:20,083
I know not, nor do you

604
00:52:20,166 --> 00:52:24,083
But this is the wonder of the divine

605
00:52:24,166 --> 00:52:28,541
I wish I could express

606
00:52:28,625 --> 00:52:32,958
What's going on within my heart

607
00:52:33,041 --> 00:52:36,875
I wish I could express

608
00:52:36,958 --> 00:52:41,583
What's going on within my heart

609
00:52:41,666 --> 00:52:45,541
Is it love or an illusion

610
00:52:46,125 --> 00:52:49,833
Wonders everyone

611
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:54,125
I wish I could express

612
00:52:54,208 --> 00:52:59,708
What's going on within my heart

613
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:01,458
Who's there, Rani ji?

614
00:53:02,291 --> 00:53:03,250
Pizza.

615
00:53:03,333 --> 00:53:04,750
But I haven't ordered one.

616
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:07,666
My treat.

617
00:53:49,416 --> 00:53:51,416
There.

618
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:53,583
You lose again!

619
00:53:54,791 --> 00:53:56,375
Champion, my foot.

620
00:54:00,625 --> 00:54:03,083
I'm focusing on winning
the real game, Rani ji.

621
00:54:03,708 --> 00:54:04,833
The one called life.

622
00:54:04,916 --> 00:54:05,958
With you.

623
00:54:11,833 --> 00:54:16,208
I'll jump off the roof if you ask me to.

624
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,250
For you.

625
00:54:20,375 --> 00:54:23,500
But I don't have the permission to love.

626
00:54:27,125 --> 00:54:33,875
Says Surekha, in Dinesh Pandit's book.

627
00:54:33,958 --> 00:54:35,041
Show me.

628
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:43,458
Read it carefully.

629
00:54:44,166 --> 00:54:48,125
You might come across a page
where Surekha gets permission to love.

630
00:54:50,291 --> 00:54:53,666
You stay up waiting for that page.

631
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:55,125
Meanwhile, I will go to bed.

632
00:54:59,166 --> 00:55:00,375
Good night.

633
00:55:01,583 --> 00:55:02,875
Yes.

634
00:55:03,458 --> 00:55:06,458
I have a PhD in waiting after all.

635
00:55:10,708 --> 00:55:11,750
Ravi…

636
00:55:14,583 --> 00:55:16,166
I got a little carried away.

637
00:55:17,458 --> 00:55:18,708
You see,

638
00:55:19,291 --> 00:55:21,208
when I see cops, my heart goes…

639
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,250
thump-thump…

640
00:55:25,375 --> 00:55:27,166
thump-thump…

641
00:55:46,458 --> 00:55:48,375
Why do you keep fighting it, Ravi?

642
00:55:49,375 --> 00:55:51,833
You don't have a hand
and I don't have a leg.

643
00:55:52,916 --> 00:55:55,541
We could make a good match.

644
00:55:55,625 --> 00:55:56,833
Perfect.

645
00:56:01,291 --> 00:56:03,250
Do you know how I lost my leg?

646
00:56:06,333 --> 00:56:09,500
I jumped off the second floor
for my last boyfriend.

647
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,208
"I gave him my heart and mine he got…

648
00:56:32,291 --> 00:56:35,583
But he butchered it
without a second thought."

649
00:56:38,750 --> 00:56:40,750
Ever since we've gotten married,

650
00:56:40,833 --> 00:56:42,750
all we do is play Snakes and Ladders.

651
00:56:42,833 --> 00:56:44,666
The board game!

652
00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:46,833
And here you are, kissing Poonam!

653
00:56:46,916 --> 00:56:49,375
She's blackmailing me
and follows me around. What do I do?

654
00:56:49,458 --> 00:56:51,708
And I pushed her away
before anything happened. You saw it!

655
00:56:52,208 --> 00:56:54,625
I told you to stay away from…

656
00:56:54,708 --> 00:56:55,708
From that horny woman!

657
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:58,083
You must have led her on!

658
00:56:58,166 --> 00:56:59,000
Seriously?

659
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:01,541
Seriously, is that how much you trust me?

660
00:57:01,625 --> 00:57:04,458
Didn't I trust you
when you said you'd marry Abhimanyu?

661
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Correct.

662
00:57:07,083 --> 00:57:08,791
It's all my fault.

663
00:57:08,875 --> 00:57:10,625
Making a plan was my fault.

664
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:13,458
Making poor Abhimanyu
a scapegoat was my fault.

665
00:57:13,541 --> 00:57:15,625
Uncle Montu was my fault too, isn't it?

666
00:57:16,416 --> 00:57:19,375
Rani, I said I'll surrender,
but you didn't agree.

667
00:57:20,166 --> 00:57:21,208
He will keep hounding us.

668
00:57:21,291 --> 00:57:23,750
To hell with you and your Uncle Montu!

669
00:57:25,291 --> 00:57:28,416
At first, we weren't in love.
When love happened, the timing was wrong.

670
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:30,250
When the timing was right,
we couldn't reunite

671
00:57:30,333 --> 00:57:31,625
because we'd become illegal!

672
00:57:31,708 --> 00:57:34,083
Finally, when things worked out
and we were about to leave,

673
00:57:34,166 --> 00:57:36,000
your Uncle Montu lands up!

674
00:57:38,083 --> 00:57:40,708
Rishu, our timing will never be right.

675
00:57:40,791 --> 00:57:41,833
Our love is doomed.

676
00:57:43,833 --> 00:57:45,750
Last time we thought our love was doomed,

677
00:57:45,833 --> 00:57:47,083
I cut off my hand!

678
00:57:48,166 --> 00:57:49,958
But I didn't let go of your hand!

679
00:57:51,708 --> 00:57:54,791
This time around,
I'll cut off someone's head if I need to.

680
00:57:55,291 --> 00:57:57,541
Your love has already made me a criminal.

681
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:19,708
What's the matter, Rani ji?

682
00:58:20,375 --> 00:58:22,416
You've started without me.

683
00:58:24,708 --> 00:58:25,791
Are you crying?

684
00:58:26,375 --> 00:58:28,041
Is everything okay?

685
00:58:29,708 --> 00:58:30,666
What?

686
00:58:31,791 --> 00:58:36,708
L-S-D. LSD

687
00:58:36,791 --> 00:58:38,625
Are you on drugs, Rani ji?

688
00:58:39,958 --> 00:58:45,083
Love, Sex, Ditching. LSD.

689
00:58:46,208 --> 00:58:48,166
It's spreading in Agra city.

690
00:58:49,166 --> 00:58:52,291
This LSD has gone rampant everywhere.

691
00:58:53,166 --> 00:58:54,291
Look,

692
00:58:54,375 --> 00:58:55,791
I want love.

693
00:58:57,666 --> 00:58:59,541
Poonam wants sex.

694
00:58:59,625 --> 00:59:01,166
And Abhimanyu is getting betrayed.

695
00:59:02,666 --> 00:59:04,291
It's so unfair on him.

696
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:06,666
I shouldn't have married him.

697
00:59:08,208 --> 00:59:10,041
I am wrong.

698
00:59:10,125 --> 00:59:11,791
Uncle Montu is wrong.

699
00:59:12,333 --> 00:59:14,833
Uncle Montu is troubling me so much.

700
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:19,791
Take me away, please.

701
00:59:20,458 --> 00:59:23,416
Take me away from here, Rishu!

702
00:59:24,458 --> 00:59:25,666
Take me away…

703
01:01:04,375 --> 01:01:05,583
Call Rishu.

704
01:01:28,791 --> 01:01:30,458
I don't want to preach.

705
01:01:31,875 --> 01:01:34,208
Both of you should leave Agra
as soon as possible.

706
01:01:34,291 --> 01:01:35,208
I'll help you.

707
01:01:35,916 --> 01:01:37,875
Passport, police, I'll manage everything.

708
01:01:39,291 --> 01:01:40,666
How?

709
01:01:40,750 --> 01:01:42,166
I'm a medical compounder.

710
01:01:42,875 --> 01:01:45,916
Judges, cops…
Everyone drops their pants for me.

711
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Because everyone falls sick.

712
01:01:48,166 --> 01:01:50,583
And it's me who gives them injections…
I'll manage everything

713
01:01:58,708 --> 01:02:02,083
But why are you doing this, Abhimanyu?

714
01:02:04,375 --> 01:02:07,500
My parents, my childhood, my youth…

715
01:02:08,041 --> 01:02:09,166
I couldn't save any of them.

716
01:02:10,125 --> 01:02:11,625
Let me at least save the person I love.

717
01:02:13,083 --> 01:02:14,916
So what if it isn't with me,

718
01:02:15,916 --> 01:02:17,875
Rani ji will be happy with someone else.

719
01:02:17,958 --> 01:02:21,750
But if I manage to get a place
in her heart, I can hope…

720
01:02:21,833 --> 01:02:23,958
if you get tired of Rishu some day…

721
01:02:24,041 --> 01:02:26,333
you'll consider me.

722
01:02:31,125 --> 01:02:33,375
It'll take her several lifetimes
to get tired of me.

723
01:02:35,750 --> 01:02:38,166
But I've heard you're very patient.

724
01:02:39,208 --> 01:02:40,500
Don't get too cocky, Rishu.

725
01:02:43,208 --> 01:02:46,083
The one you love is with you now
while I have been wronged.

726
01:02:47,708 --> 01:02:49,541
Fate is a wicked thing.

727
01:02:50,833 --> 01:02:52,083
Without it favoring you,

728
01:02:52,166 --> 01:02:54,583
even a love spanning
lifetimes may never unite.

729
01:02:54,666 --> 01:02:58,791
And if it does, even two strangers
who meet on a train

730
01:02:59,708 --> 01:03:01,416
can become companions
in the journey of life.

731
01:03:06,166 --> 01:03:09,166
Lines of fate are etched
on our hands, my friend.

732
01:03:10,083 --> 01:03:13,416
And I've chopped off my own hand for love.

733
01:03:35,166 --> 01:03:38,500
SAHANI CLINIC

734
01:03:47,875 --> 01:03:48,916
Wait.

735
01:04:13,875 --> 01:04:18,958
So you'll leave for Thailand in two days.
You can stay here until then.

736
01:04:20,166 --> 01:04:22,458
This is your bed.
The bathroom is over there.

737
01:04:23,125 --> 01:04:24,958
No one will come here today
as it's Sunday.

738
01:04:25,041 --> 01:04:26,791
I'll come in through the back door too.

739
01:04:36,458 --> 01:04:37,958
I'll lock this door from the outside.

740
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:39,291
Thank you.

741
01:05:13,458 --> 01:05:14,416
Can I come with you?

742
01:05:18,208 --> 01:05:19,083
It's risky.

743
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:25,833
Abhimanyu…

744
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,041
Sorry.

745
01:05:34,333 --> 01:05:35,666
I mean it.

746
01:05:37,166 --> 01:05:38,208
If you really mean it,

747
01:05:38,291 --> 01:05:40,625
will you watch a movie with me
one last time?

748
01:05:50,916 --> 01:05:52,000
Okay.

749
01:05:53,583 --> 01:05:55,333
Let me go deliver lunch to your husband.

750
01:05:57,291 --> 01:05:59,708
And then I'll take my wife for a movie.

751
01:06:26,541 --> 01:06:27,500
Poonam?

752
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:41,291
How did you know I was here?

753
01:06:42,375 --> 01:06:43,583
I followed you.

754
01:06:45,291 --> 01:06:46,791
You were planning to resign and disappear?

755
01:06:46,875 --> 01:06:48,291
I followed you to the--

756
01:07:00,125 --> 01:07:01,458
Give me a month, Poonam.

757
01:07:01,541 --> 01:07:03,125
I'll come and meet you after that.

758
01:07:18,458 --> 01:07:21,958
And if you don't, then…

759
01:07:49,958 --> 01:07:51,333
Poonam, I said…

760
01:08:11,458 --> 01:08:12,583
Peas pulao.

761
01:08:14,250 --> 01:08:16,125
It's your favorite, Rani ji said.

762
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,750
Yes. Come inside.

763
01:08:38,041 --> 01:08:40,125
Flowers…

764
01:08:42,666 --> 01:08:43,916
Did a woman come here?

765
01:08:45,583 --> 01:08:47,416
Yes. Poonam was here.

766
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:48,458
Who is Poonam?

767
01:08:50,125 --> 01:08:51,458
She was my landlady.

768
01:08:52,083 --> 01:08:53,458
Why was she here?

769
01:08:54,625 --> 01:08:56,500
Well, Abhimanyu…

770
01:08:59,625 --> 01:09:00,583
She follows me around.

771
01:09:01,875 --> 01:09:02,791
She even blackmails me.

772
01:09:04,375 --> 01:09:06,083
-Blackmail?
-Yes.

773
01:09:06,166 --> 01:09:07,666
Why? Does she want money?

774
01:09:10,083 --> 01:09:11,083
She must want something.

775
01:09:12,416 --> 01:09:13,750
Me.

776
01:09:14,375 --> 01:09:15,916
-You?
-Yes.

777
01:09:25,666 --> 01:09:27,208
Good heavens!

778
01:09:33,125 --> 01:09:34,083
What's her full name?

779
01:09:36,708 --> 01:09:37,833
Why do you want to know?

780
01:09:39,666 --> 01:09:41,166
I might send her a friend request.

781
01:09:43,125 --> 01:09:45,291
Don't worry, she won't tell anyone.

782
01:09:47,541 --> 01:09:49,166
She says she loves me.

783
01:09:55,375 --> 01:09:56,708
Love!

784
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:02,083
Poonam wants you.

785
01:10:02,166 --> 01:10:03,750
And you want Rani ji.

786
01:10:03,833 --> 01:10:06,291
I want Rani ji too.
While Rani ji wants you.

787
01:10:07,583 --> 01:10:11,000
So many of us are spending
our youth chasing someone.

788
01:10:12,583 --> 01:10:16,833
Why don't you simplify this
and take a U-turn towards Poonam?

789
01:10:16,916 --> 01:10:18,458
And then Rani ji and I will be together.

790
01:10:18,541 --> 01:10:19,750
No more chasing.

791
01:10:24,333 --> 01:10:25,375
I am kidding.

792
01:10:26,625 --> 01:10:29,208
Don't take this seriously.

793
01:10:29,291 --> 01:10:30,625
Enjoy your meal. I'll leave now.

794
01:10:30,708 --> 01:10:32,250
-Thank you.
-Okay.

795
01:10:38,208 --> 01:10:39,291
What's wrong?

796
01:10:42,750 --> 01:10:44,250
Someone else was here as well.

797
01:10:49,583 --> 01:10:50,833
Not really.

798
01:11:13,041 --> 01:11:15,166
Does Rani ji know you're a liar?

799
01:11:16,083 --> 01:11:18,333
The movie plan was better, no?

800
01:11:20,583 --> 01:11:22,541
There are crocodiles in this area.

801
01:11:23,416 --> 01:11:26,375
Maybe they're under
the railway bridge, no?

802
01:11:27,708 --> 01:11:32,666
The cops have taped that area.

803
01:11:33,208 --> 01:11:36,041
So I guess this place is safe.

804
01:11:37,916 --> 01:11:38,833
Isn't it?

805
01:11:40,416 --> 01:11:43,250
Rani ji, do you think the tapes
will stop the crocodiles?

806
01:11:45,250 --> 01:11:46,875
The river is their home.

807
01:11:46,958 --> 01:11:50,666
If someone enters your home
and your life after telling lies,…

808
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,750
of course they won't sit quietly.

809
01:11:55,750 --> 01:11:57,708
I've told Lallan so many times

810
01:11:58,416 --> 01:12:00,625
to take his shoes off outside.

811
01:12:03,291 --> 01:12:05,333
This soil is from the jungles of Rajgir.

812
01:12:06,875 --> 01:12:09,333
The place I got that snake from.

813
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,541
The one whose bite killed
my entire family.

814
01:12:12,625 --> 01:12:14,041
Lallan must have told you about it.

815
01:12:21,875 --> 01:12:23,000
You know, Rani ji,

816
01:12:23,666 --> 01:12:26,250
my uncle betrayed my dad

817
01:12:26,833 --> 01:12:27,875
and stole his business.

818
01:12:30,375 --> 01:12:32,875
That's why I killed his entire family.

819
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,041
I can't stand betrayal.
I have a soft heart.

820
01:12:40,583 --> 01:12:44,333
I loved you with all my heart.

821
01:12:48,750 --> 01:12:50,416
But even you…

822
01:12:53,625 --> 01:12:55,916
I kept the snake hungry for four days.

823
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,791
So when the hungry and angry snake bites,

824
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:02,166
it would bite deeper.

825
01:13:03,666 --> 01:13:05,500
And death is certain.

826
01:13:09,458 --> 01:13:12,416
If you control a man or an animal by their
habits and tendencies…

827
01:13:14,125 --> 01:13:15,958
you can make them do whatever you want.

828
01:13:31,958 --> 01:13:33,166
Abhimanyu!

829
01:13:37,541 --> 01:13:38,541
Abhimanyu.

830
01:13:40,083 --> 01:13:41,291
Abhimanyu,

831
01:13:41,875 --> 01:13:43,458
Don't you dare hurt Rani!

832
01:13:58,125 --> 01:14:00,416
Tell me one last truth, Rani ji.

833
01:14:02,416 --> 01:14:07,250
Did you, even for once,
think we could be together?

834
01:14:13,708 --> 01:14:14,708
Yes.

835
01:14:16,916 --> 01:14:17,791
I did.

836
01:14:20,625 --> 01:14:22,041
At another time

837
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:25,041
and place maybe.

838
01:14:26,916 --> 01:14:29,250
If Rishu wasn't in my life,

839
01:14:31,458 --> 01:14:32,625
we could have been together.

840
01:14:41,833 --> 01:14:42,750
Okay then.

841
01:14:46,208 --> 01:14:49,625
You, me and my pink Taj Mahal
is enough for me.

842
01:14:51,291 --> 01:14:55,416
Life is good. The person I love
is in love with someone else.

843
01:14:57,708 --> 01:14:58,708
But it's okay, Rani ji.

844
01:14:58,791 --> 01:15:00,625
This is expected.

845
01:15:02,458 --> 01:15:05,125
If there isn't a trail
of Rani ji's dead lovers lying around,

846
01:15:05,208 --> 01:15:07,666
I doubt if anyone is truly in love
in this city.

847
01:15:50,208 --> 01:15:51,166
You know what, Rani ji?

848
01:15:52,708 --> 01:15:54,333
We have another thing in common.

849
01:16:01,416 --> 01:16:03,041
Dinesh Pandit's stories.

850
01:16:03,541 --> 01:16:07,500
You played out the story
of Wrath in Kasauli in your life.

851
01:16:07,583 --> 01:16:08,583
And I…

852
01:16:09,333 --> 01:16:10,791
The Revenge of the Cobra.

853
01:16:12,208 --> 01:16:16,166
Both our lives are heavily
influenced by Pandit's writings.

854
01:16:18,125 --> 01:16:20,041
You've met your match.

855
01:16:21,291 --> 01:16:25,166
We'll have to wait and see
who's Pandit's bigger fan?

856
01:16:30,333 --> 01:16:31,958
The day you walked into the clinic,

857
01:16:33,541 --> 01:16:39,375
I spotted Pandit's book
in your beautiful hands.

858
01:16:40,833 --> 01:16:43,125
Then your sky-blue dupatta.

859
01:16:43,875 --> 01:16:44,916
Then your pink kameez…

860
01:16:46,041 --> 01:16:46,958
Then your eyes…

861
01:16:48,750 --> 01:16:50,375
By the time I saw your lips,

862
01:16:51,208 --> 01:16:52,875
I was already in love.

863
01:17:12,625 --> 01:17:16,166
Help.

864
01:17:17,166 --> 01:17:18,250
Help!

865
01:17:21,166 --> 01:17:22,250
Help!

866
01:17:22,333 --> 01:17:23,375
My husband will kill me!

867
01:17:24,250 --> 01:17:27,375
Please save me! My husband will kill me.

868
01:17:27,875 --> 01:17:29,125
Please.

869
01:17:35,375 --> 01:17:38,916
Sir, I've been telling them
my husband will kill me.

870
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,541
Abhimanyu is very dangerous.

871
01:17:42,250 --> 01:17:45,208
He has murdered his entire family, sir,
after reading Dinesh Pandit's novels.

872
01:17:45,291 --> 01:17:46,750
Sir, he's a psycho!

873
01:17:46,833 --> 01:17:47,666
He will kill me!

874
01:17:47,750 --> 01:17:49,666
Looks like you're stuck between

875
01:17:49,750 --> 01:17:51,541
the devil and the deep blue sea.

876
01:17:52,250 --> 01:17:54,416
Sir, are you even listening to me?

877
01:17:55,208 --> 01:17:57,208
If you don't arrest him now, then…

878
01:17:57,291 --> 01:17:58,416
Then what?

879
01:18:00,041 --> 01:18:01,500
Then he'll kill…

880
01:18:02,791 --> 01:18:05,208
You're safe in here, chatting with me.

881
01:18:05,291 --> 01:18:06,458
Who else would he kill?

882
01:18:09,791 --> 01:18:11,208
Rishu.

883
01:18:17,541 --> 01:18:18,458
Who?

884
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:22,833
Rishu.

885
01:18:36,625 --> 01:18:38,166
Hello, Elder Brother.

886
01:18:40,166 --> 01:18:41,708
I told you

887
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:48,291
I would nab Neel's murderer
and throw him at your feet.

888
01:18:53,333 --> 01:18:54,750
I'll call you back in a while.

889
01:19:00,916 --> 01:19:01,916
Great.

890
01:19:08,125 --> 01:19:09,666
I must say…

891
01:19:12,041 --> 01:19:14,208
Romeo is fire.

892
01:19:14,291 --> 01:19:16,291
Madam's spark, even better.

893
01:19:17,583 --> 01:19:19,083
Oh! They're dynamite together!

894
01:19:24,166 --> 01:19:25,916
Amazing.

895
01:19:29,625 --> 01:19:31,750
Go and find madam's…

896
01:19:33,541 --> 01:19:34,458
husbands!

897
01:19:34,541 --> 01:19:35,708
Okay, sir.

898
01:19:36,750 --> 01:19:37,875
What, sir?

899
01:19:38,541 --> 01:19:39,625
Go!

900
01:20:02,833 --> 01:20:04,083
Chiraunji…

901
01:20:26,791 --> 01:20:29,583
DINESH PANDIT

902
01:20:30,166 --> 01:20:33,958
Interesting.
Pandit makes an entry as well.

903
01:20:36,875 --> 01:20:38,000
Okay, sir.

904
01:20:43,916 --> 01:20:45,041
Hello?

905
01:20:47,541 --> 01:20:49,458
Sir, there has been a development.

906
01:21:49,333 --> 01:21:50,458
Remember your lover's face?

907
01:21:55,583 --> 01:21:57,541
Come take a last look.

908
01:21:58,416 --> 01:21:59,541
Come on!

909
01:22:14,666 --> 01:22:16,791
The second patrol party
will reach in ten minutes. Over.

910
01:22:29,083 --> 01:22:30,916
To whom do these belong, Rani ji?

911
01:22:33,416 --> 01:22:34,916
SAHANI CLINIC

912
01:22:39,833 --> 01:22:40,791
Abhimanyu.

913
01:22:57,666 --> 01:22:59,333
Rani Kashyap…

914
01:23:02,541 --> 01:23:05,083
we have reasonable suspicion on you

915
01:23:05,166 --> 01:23:10,291
for the double murder of Poonam Prajapati
and Abhimanyu Bharadwaj.

916
01:23:13,458 --> 01:23:14,416
I didn't kill them.

917
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,166
Damn, I'll have to question her again.

918
01:23:25,375 --> 01:23:27,291
Where is Rishu Saxena?

919
01:23:31,541 --> 01:23:32,666
Come on.

920
01:23:47,708 --> 01:23:50,500
I can't find one husband,
but she lands a bunch of them!

921
01:23:50,583 --> 01:23:53,000
And she's killing them off one by one.

922
01:24:02,208 --> 01:24:03,375
Meena ji.

923
01:24:06,958 --> 01:24:08,625
According to the law,

924
01:24:09,708 --> 01:24:11,708
how long can we keep her in custody?

925
01:24:11,791 --> 01:24:16,083
We have to produce her in front
of the Magistrate within 24 hours.

926
01:24:19,625 --> 01:24:20,916
Meena ji,

927
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:24,458
you were leaving for court with Rani ji

928
01:24:25,625 --> 01:24:27,000
when you twisted your ankle.

929
01:24:27,958 --> 01:24:29,791
When you sat in the car,

930
01:24:29,875 --> 01:24:31,416
you had a flat tire.

931
01:24:33,375 --> 01:24:35,375
It was quite late by the time
you reached the court.

932
01:24:35,958 --> 01:24:37,250
And the court had closed by then.

933
01:24:37,333 --> 01:24:39,041
The next day is a Sunday.

934
01:24:39,916 --> 01:24:41,666
So when will you take her to court next?

935
01:24:42,333 --> 01:24:43,666
On Monday, sir.

936
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:45,916
-Then Monday it is.
-Sir.

937
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,166
Wait.

938
01:24:47,750 --> 01:24:50,125
Take Mr. Disciplinarian with you.

939
01:24:50,708 --> 01:24:52,541
Make sure to use him freely.

940
01:24:54,708 --> 01:24:55,708
Sir.

941
01:25:07,166 --> 01:25:08,708
You're always talking big, aren't you?

942
01:25:11,708 --> 01:25:12,875
But today,

943
01:25:13,541 --> 01:25:14,791
all you'll do is scream.

944
01:25:17,541 --> 01:25:19,083
Pandit writes,

945
01:25:20,083 --> 01:25:22,458
"You can drown us, burn us,
or bury us a mile…

946
01:25:23,208 --> 01:25:26,666
but in the face of oppression,

947
01:25:26,750 --> 01:25:29,083
bestow upon us lovers the strength
to bear it all with a smile."

948
01:25:36,083 --> 01:25:39,625
Know this and also tell Uncle Montu.

949
01:25:40,875 --> 01:25:43,958
If Rishu finds out
you've dared to touch me,

950
01:25:44,666 --> 01:25:49,208
a man who cut off his hand for me
won't hesitate to--

951
01:25:53,458 --> 01:25:57,041
Gosh. Such passion.

952
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:00,833
Divine lovers.

953
01:26:15,125 --> 01:26:17,083
-You. Come here.
-Yes, sir?

954
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,083
Sir.

955
01:26:20,666 --> 01:26:22,708
Spread the word among the media

956
01:26:22,791 --> 01:26:25,541
that madam is being beaten up
at the police station.

957
01:26:25,625 --> 01:26:27,750
Brutally beaten up.

958
01:26:27,833 --> 01:26:29,041
But make sure

959
01:26:29,750 --> 01:26:31,083
there are no marks on her face.

960
01:26:31,166 --> 01:26:34,375
Sir, it's not right
to beat her up in custody.

961
01:26:34,458 --> 01:26:37,541
If the media finds out,
they will raise a hue and cry.

962
01:26:37,625 --> 01:26:39,291
That's exactly what we want.

963
01:26:39,791 --> 01:26:44,208
Agra Police are crossing
all boundaries and limits.

964
01:26:45,250 --> 01:26:46,833
We have the confirmed news.

965
01:26:48,166 --> 01:26:50,958
To cover up their incompetence,

966
01:26:51,041 --> 01:26:53,208
double-murder accused Rani Kashyap

967
01:26:53,291 --> 01:26:57,250
who was under suspicion previously,

968
01:26:57,333 --> 01:27:00,958
is being brutally beaten up
even before she's produced in court.

969
01:27:01,041 --> 01:27:05,541
Who will take responsibility
if something untoward happens?

970
01:27:20,041 --> 01:27:21,458
Chiraunji!y

971
01:27:21,541 --> 01:27:23,500
-Chiraunji!
-I, Rishabh Saxena,

972
01:27:23,583 --> 01:27:26,041
am ready to surrender to the police.

973
01:27:26,833 --> 01:27:27,750
But on one condition.

974
01:27:27,833 --> 01:27:31,458
Rani has to be present
at the time of my surrender.

975
01:27:31,541 --> 01:27:34,583
She should come walking towards me, alone,

976
01:27:34,666 --> 01:27:36,958
so that I'm assured that she's okay.

977
01:27:37,541 --> 01:27:39,250
Only then will I surrender

978
01:27:39,916 --> 01:27:42,875
in three days, at 8:00 p.m.

979
01:27:42,958 --> 01:27:44,250
on the railway bridge.

980
01:28:04,125 --> 01:28:05,208
Salute, sir.

981
01:28:11,541 --> 01:28:14,333
Conduct a recce of the entire area.

982
01:28:14,416 --> 01:28:15,541
Yes, sir.

983
01:28:18,625 --> 01:28:21,666
And ask
these Forest Department people to leave.

984
01:28:22,250 --> 01:28:24,666
Sir, there are crocodiles
under the bridge, so…

985
01:28:24,750 --> 01:28:27,208
I don't want anyone apart from cops
in this area.

986
01:28:27,291 --> 01:28:28,375
Okay.

987
01:28:31,375 --> 01:28:32,541
Sir.

988
01:28:34,416 --> 01:28:39,125
We'll stop the train scheduled to cross
the railway bridge at 8:00 p.m. tomorrow.

989
01:28:40,291 --> 01:28:42,291
Our men will be present in two groups.

990
01:28:42,833 --> 01:28:45,958
The moment we spot Rishu on the bridge,

991
01:28:46,791 --> 01:28:48,083
we will surround him.

992
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:06,333
Isn't everything seeming a tad too easy?

993
01:29:07,791 --> 01:29:09,833
I don't think we should give
in to Rishu's conditions

994
01:29:09,916 --> 01:29:12,166
and let Rani go to the bridge alone.

995
01:29:15,333 --> 01:29:19,750
We will find a way to outsmart Rishu.

996
01:29:20,875 --> 01:29:24,583
When Rani goes to meet him on the bridge,

997
01:29:24,666 --> 01:29:27,458
our team will close in on him.

998
01:29:28,458 --> 01:29:30,666
There will be cops on the bridge and…

999
01:29:32,375 --> 01:29:33,625
certain death underneath it.

1000
01:29:35,291 --> 01:29:39,458
The lovers will struggle
for a little while

1001
01:29:42,541 --> 01:29:45,291
before getting separated forever.

1002
01:29:46,875 --> 01:29:47,708
Amazing!

1003
01:29:51,083 --> 01:29:52,583
Move.

1004
01:30:57,708 --> 01:30:58,583
Meena!

1005
01:31:21,666 --> 01:31:22,916
Team B on standby.

1006
01:31:23,583 --> 01:31:25,291
Wait for my command.

1007
01:31:47,208 --> 01:31:48,166
Rani.

1008
01:31:48,791 --> 01:31:49,791
Rishu!

1009
01:31:49,875 --> 01:31:51,125
Rishu, you won't surrender.

1010
01:31:51,208 --> 01:31:53,791
You won't! We'll escape.

1011
01:31:53,875 --> 01:31:55,708
Move in. I repeat, move in.

1012
01:31:55,791 --> 01:31:57,166
-Seal the bridge.
-Okay, sir.

1013
01:32:04,833 --> 01:32:05,708
Rani…

1014
01:32:13,625 --> 01:32:15,291
Where is he going?

1015
01:32:15,375 --> 01:32:16,583
Who is he?

1016
01:32:19,208 --> 01:32:21,875
Sir, come in.
Someone is breaking the cordon.

1017
01:32:26,750 --> 01:32:28,000
Who's that fool?

1018
01:32:28,666 --> 01:32:30,083
He's breaking the formation!

1019
01:32:43,333 --> 01:32:46,250
The warrior from Mahabharata
who is known for breaking formations.

1020
01:32:48,666 --> 01:32:50,041
Sir, the DNA report is here.

1021
01:32:50,125 --> 01:32:51,500
The sample doesn't match the body.

1022
01:33:00,041 --> 01:33:01,541
No one will take action.

1023
01:33:02,291 --> 01:33:05,291
I repeat, no one will take action.

1024
01:33:05,375 --> 01:33:08,625
Keep everyone ready,
but no one will go forward.

1025
01:33:18,750 --> 01:33:21,000
Sir, everyone should stay where they are.

1026
01:33:21,083 --> 01:33:24,125
Otherwise, I won't hesitate to shoot.

1027
01:33:24,708 --> 01:33:25,916
Abhimanyu!

1028
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:29,333
You won't be able to escape.
You're surrounded.

1029
01:33:29,416 --> 01:33:32,791
Put your gun down and talk to us.

1030
01:33:34,583 --> 01:33:36,583
I'm not here to talk to you, sir.

1031
01:33:37,083 --> 01:33:38,791
I'm here to present a case

1032
01:33:38,875 --> 01:33:42,041
for myself and everyone
who gets left behind

1033
01:33:42,708 --> 01:33:43,666
and betrayed.

1034
01:33:45,125 --> 01:33:47,833
Everyone who has been
cheated and deceived in love.

1035
01:33:47,916 --> 01:33:49,875
No one loses in love.

1036
01:33:51,791 --> 01:33:53,541
Love sets you free.

1037
01:33:58,333 --> 01:33:59,833
I'm not here to listen to your poetry.

1038
01:34:08,250 --> 01:34:10,000
I truly loved you, Rani ji.

1039
01:34:11,375 --> 01:34:13,500
I have told you all about myself.

1040
01:34:13,583 --> 01:34:17,250
I even showed you the pink Taj Mahal
from my terrace.

1041
01:34:17,333 --> 01:34:18,875
I laid bare my heart to you.

1042
01:34:19,833 --> 01:34:22,958
You could've told me the truth.
I never forced you to do anything.

1043
01:34:23,708 --> 01:34:24,625
To make things worse…

1044
01:34:26,375 --> 01:34:29,000
you went and told the cops about me.

1045
01:34:32,458 --> 01:34:34,833
I told you, Rani ji,

1046
01:34:34,916 --> 01:34:36,958
I can't stand betrayal!

1047
01:34:46,958 --> 01:34:47,875
Rishu.

1048
01:34:59,958 --> 01:35:00,958
Rani…

1049
01:35:02,125 --> 01:35:02,958
Rani, no.

1050
01:35:06,416 --> 01:35:07,500
Rani!

1051
01:35:08,333 --> 01:35:09,666
Hold my hand, Rani.

1052
01:35:36,875 --> 01:35:40,666
Agra Police's woes don't seem to end.

1053
01:35:40,750 --> 01:35:44,083
This incident took place
during Rishu Saxena's surrender,

1054
01:35:44,166 --> 01:35:46,083
in which Rishu and Rani

1055
01:35:46,166 --> 01:35:49,833
disappeared into
the crocodile-infested Yamuna River!

1056
01:35:49,916 --> 01:35:53,833
There's also news of another unidentified
man falling into the river.

1057
01:35:53,916 --> 01:35:55,333
What remains to be seen is

1058
01:35:55,416 --> 01:35:58,500
if this case of drowning

1059
01:35:58,583 --> 01:36:00,916
will drown the UP Police's
reputation as well.

1060
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,625
Sir, does that mean their story is over?

1061
01:36:04,541 --> 01:36:06,708
Their story has just begun.

1062
01:36:08,083 --> 01:36:09,666
Start the search operation.

1063
01:36:09,750 --> 01:36:11,250
Yes, sir.

1064
01:36:14,958 --> 01:36:16,375
A NEW TURN
IN THE RISHU SAXENA SURRENDER CASE

1065
01:36:19,208 --> 01:36:20,625
SNAKE BITE KILLS AN ENTIRE FAMILY

1066
01:36:23,333 --> 01:36:26,250
In what she says

1067
01:36:26,833 --> 01:36:29,750
And what you see

1068
01:36:29,833 --> 01:36:33,541
Far from these, you will find

1069
01:36:33,625 --> 01:36:36,833
The hidden truth

1070
01:36:36,916 --> 01:36:38,916
Pieces of truth

1071
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:40,500
Fragments of lies

1072
01:36:40,583 --> 01:36:42,250
Have merged together

1073
01:36:42,333 --> 01:36:44,125
To form a broken image

1074
01:36:44,208 --> 01:36:47,583
To pick and choose

1075
01:36:47,666 --> 01:36:50,625
To reweave each thread, anew

1076
01:36:50,708 --> 01:36:54,250
To pick and choose

1077
01:36:54,333 --> 01:36:57,958
To reweave each thread, anew

1078
01:36:58,041 --> 01:37:01,333
Once you see through the web of lies

1079
01:37:01,416 --> 01:37:04,708
You will gain clarity

1080
01:37:04,791 --> 01:37:08,500
And the truth will set you free

1081
01:37:08,583 --> 01:37:11,708
And the truth will set you free

1082
01:37:11,791 --> 01:37:15,416
And the truth will set you free

1083
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:18,875
And the truth will set you free

1084
01:37:18,958 --> 01:37:21,166
Abhimanyu, Rishu, Rani…

1085
01:37:21,250 --> 01:37:24,166
Their house, office, clinic, salon,

1086
01:37:24,250 --> 01:37:26,875
and all surrounding areas…

1087
01:37:26,958 --> 01:37:31,000
I want all mobile and laptop recordings
and CCTV footage of every place.

1088
01:37:31,083 --> 01:37:32,750
Okay, sir.

1089
01:37:32,833 --> 01:37:36,166
What can and cannot be

1090
01:37:36,250 --> 01:37:39,250
Lie in the realm of darkness

1091
01:37:39,333 --> 01:37:46,333
While the dim light reveals
Countless stories

1092
01:37:46,416 --> 01:37:52,666
Why does the mind strive
To clear these webs?

1093
01:37:53,250 --> 01:37:59,708
Why does the mind strive
To clear these webs?

1094
01:37:59,791 --> 01:38:04,000
Once you see through the web of lies

1095
01:38:04,083 --> 01:38:07,416
You will gain clarity

1096
01:38:07,500 --> 01:38:11,208
The truth will set you free

1097
01:38:11,291 --> 01:38:14,291
The truth will set you free

1098
01:38:17,166 --> 01:38:18,583
Kishore…

1099
01:38:19,666 --> 01:38:21,291
Want to hear a story?

1100
01:38:22,958 --> 01:38:25,208
POLICE STATION, AGRA

1101
01:38:28,375 --> 01:38:29,375
This…

1102
01:38:30,958 --> 01:38:33,166
Indigestion is a dangerous thing, sir.

1103
01:38:33,958 --> 01:38:35,958
We don't take it seriously

1104
01:38:36,041 --> 01:38:38,958
and keep having digestives to ease it.

1105
01:38:40,541 --> 01:38:41,833
But sometimes…

1106
01:38:43,833 --> 01:38:48,000
it could be the symptom
of a serious illness.

1107
01:38:48,083 --> 01:38:49,125
Like cancer.

1108
01:38:50,041 --> 01:38:52,958
This case is just like indigestion, sir.

1109
01:38:53,458 --> 01:38:55,833
While we're looking for answers,

1110
01:38:55,916 --> 01:38:57,083
what appears isn't what is.

1111
01:38:57,791 --> 01:38:58,750
What is your point?

1112
01:39:02,583 --> 01:39:04,125
Sir, with Rani's,

1113
01:39:05,208 --> 01:39:08,291
Rishu's, and Abhimanyu's death,

1114
01:39:09,166 --> 01:39:10,916
who stood to gain the most?

1115
01:39:15,125 --> 01:39:15,958
Rani…

1116
01:39:19,125 --> 01:39:20,041
Rishu…

1117
01:39:22,458 --> 01:39:23,541
And Abhimanyu.

1118
01:39:27,583 --> 01:39:28,458
What do you mean?

1119
01:39:28,541 --> 01:39:31,291
What I mean is,
had these three been alive,

1120
01:39:31,375 --> 01:39:32,666
they would have been in jail.

1121
01:39:34,250 --> 01:39:36,500
Rani was already in jail.

1122
01:39:36,583 --> 01:39:38,791
So would Rishu for murdering Neel.

1123
01:39:39,916 --> 01:39:41,666
And Abhimanyu, as well,

1124
01:39:42,166 --> 01:39:43,666
for murdering his family.

1125
01:39:43,750 --> 01:39:45,041
SNAKE BITE KILLS AN ENTIRE FAMILY

1126
01:39:46,291 --> 01:39:50,125
Abhimanyu was being blackmailed
by a man called Lallan.

1127
01:39:52,083 --> 01:39:56,791
This snake charmer had helped Abhimanyu
to murder his family.

1128
01:39:58,625 --> 01:40:00,250
On the day of the double murder,

1129
01:40:01,416 --> 01:40:04,750
Lallan had gone to meet
Abhimanyu at his clinic.

1130
01:40:04,833 --> 01:40:08,083
We found that footage
from an ATM in front of the clinic.

1131
01:40:12,291 --> 01:40:13,208
Dead.

1132
01:40:16,208 --> 01:40:18,625
The other dead body was that of Poonam.

1133
01:40:21,041 --> 01:40:24,250
Poonam had gone
to meet Rishu at the clinic that day.

1134
01:40:26,166 --> 01:40:27,916
She knew his secret.

1135
01:40:31,958 --> 01:40:33,500
She died as well.

1136
01:40:34,750 --> 01:40:35,916
Perfect victims.

1137
01:40:38,291 --> 01:40:41,333
Compounder Abhimanyu,

1138
01:40:42,041 --> 01:40:43,791
an ace Biology student,

1139
01:40:45,375 --> 01:40:48,625
knew exactly how to burn a body

1140
01:40:48,708 --> 01:40:50,833
and where to place objects

1141
01:40:50,916 --> 01:40:53,583
so that they can be identified instantly.

1142
01:41:11,583 --> 01:41:13,708
The story gets even more interesting, sir.

1143
01:41:13,791 --> 01:41:18,958
We found some more footage
from Bobby Garage.

1144
01:41:19,041 --> 01:41:20,500
According to this footage,

1145
01:41:20,583 --> 01:41:24,083
Rani and Abhimanyu
returned home at 7:00 p.m.

1146
01:41:24,708 --> 01:41:27,041
Fifteen minutes later,

1147
01:41:27,125 --> 01:41:30,750
we see someone else entering
Abhimanyu's house.

1148
01:41:30,833 --> 01:41:31,875
Rishu.

1149
01:41:34,958 --> 01:41:39,625
The three of them probably
came up with a plan.

1150
01:41:40,916 --> 01:41:42,250
Because at 10:00 p.m.,

1151
01:41:42,833 --> 01:41:46,416
a helpless-looking Rani ji

1152
01:41:46,500 --> 01:41:48,208
is seen running in the rain.

1153
01:41:51,833 --> 01:41:53,916
Help!

1154
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,750
Please save me! My husband will kill me.

1155
01:41:58,041 --> 01:41:59,750
Sir, what's interesting is that…

1156
01:41:59,833 --> 01:42:01,333
after Rani,

1157
01:42:01,416 --> 01:42:03,375
two more people left Abhimanyu's house.

1158
01:42:05,541 --> 01:42:08,500
Rishu and Abhimanyu.

1159
01:42:13,958 --> 01:42:15,708
Sir, that's why I'm saying…

1160
01:42:18,958 --> 01:42:20,333
that night,

1161
01:42:21,583 --> 01:42:23,000
they did come up with a plan.

1162
01:42:26,583 --> 01:42:28,833
So you're saying their plan

1163
01:42:29,791 --> 01:42:32,958
was to jump into the river
in front of everyone?

1164
01:42:34,666 --> 01:42:36,166
But there were crocodiles in the river.

1165
01:42:37,166 --> 01:42:38,458
They would die immediately.

1166
01:42:39,458 --> 01:42:40,583
What kind of a plan is this?

1167
01:42:42,458 --> 01:42:43,958
That's the twist, sir.

1168
01:42:45,750 --> 01:42:47,916
The question still remains…

1169
01:42:49,250 --> 01:42:52,500
Why did Rishu choose
the railway bridge location?

1170
01:42:53,666 --> 01:42:55,583
There's no plot twist!
That's the whole case.

1171
01:42:57,458 --> 01:42:58,416
Montu…

1172
01:43:00,458 --> 01:43:01,791
Sir.

1173
01:43:02,875 --> 01:43:04,916
I know this case is personal for you,

1174
01:43:06,416 --> 01:43:07,375
but let this one go.

1175
01:43:07,458 --> 01:43:09,416
We are under pressure from the media.

1176
01:43:09,500 --> 01:43:11,166
Close this case.

1177
01:43:11,708 --> 01:43:15,208
Because the deeper you probe,

1178
01:43:16,083 --> 01:43:18,666
the deeper the problems
for our department will be.

1179
01:43:21,458 --> 01:43:22,375
Sir.

1180
01:43:22,458 --> 01:43:24,958
We can't close this case again.

1181
01:43:25,041 --> 01:43:27,458
Please give me some more time, sir.

1182
01:43:30,958 --> 01:43:32,208
Darn.

1183
01:43:45,416 --> 01:43:49,416
Closing a case file
doesn't mean the case is closed.

1184
01:43:51,666 --> 01:43:53,708
However hard one tries to hide it,

1185
01:43:54,458 --> 01:43:57,166
the truth will come out one day.

1186
01:43:59,916 --> 01:44:01,250
Anyway…

1187
01:44:02,750 --> 01:44:04,416
you're the department's woodpecker…

1188
01:44:29,750 --> 01:44:35,000
SIX MONTHS LATER

1189
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:43,750
-Rishu!
-Rani ji.

1190
01:44:43,833 --> 01:44:45,708
Rishu!

1191
01:44:46,375 --> 01:44:47,416
Rishu!

1192
01:44:47,500 --> 01:44:49,500
Rani ji…

1193
01:45:09,833 --> 01:45:11,041
Good evening.

1194
01:45:16,666 --> 01:45:19,625
Correct the spelling.

1195
01:45:24,208 --> 01:45:25,916
Is everything okay?

1196
01:45:26,833 --> 01:45:28,750
Yes. Everything is fine.

1197
01:45:29,458 --> 01:45:30,958
I'm just tired.

1198
01:45:35,458 --> 01:45:38,083
Complete this, I'll be back.

1199
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:40,083
Do you want water?

1200
01:45:40,166 --> 01:45:41,291
No.

1201
01:45:47,500 --> 01:45:51,375
SHARDA PRIMARY SCHOOL, DEVSAR

1202
01:45:51,458 --> 01:45:57,166
-Now come and submit your homework.
-Yes, ma'am.

1203
01:46:01,208 --> 01:46:03,708
-Very good.
-Ma'am!

1204
01:46:05,958 --> 01:46:08,208
-Completed your homework, Meenakshi?
-Yes, ma'am.

1205
01:46:32,750 --> 01:46:34,166
CHAKIA, BIHAR

1206
01:46:34,250 --> 01:46:39,291
Listen, someone has sent a book for you.

1207
01:46:39,916 --> 01:46:42,291
There's a crocodile
on the cover of the book.

1208
01:46:49,541 --> 01:46:51,125
DINESH PANDIT, THE CROCODILE'S TRAP

1209
01:47:01,291 --> 01:47:03,625
There are only three copies of this book.

1210
01:47:03,708 --> 01:47:05,500
This is one of them.

1211
01:47:11,750 --> 01:47:13,291
Suraj and Arjun came up with a plan

1212
01:47:13,375 --> 01:47:15,500
to escape from the police's trap,

1213
01:47:15,583 --> 01:47:19,375
they'd have to dive into
the jaws of the crocodile.

1214
01:47:19,458 --> 01:47:22,041
They had purposely chosen

1215
01:47:22,625 --> 01:47:24,625
this area infested
with dangerous crocodiles.

1216
01:47:24,708 --> 01:47:29,000
They started their preparations
three days before the incident.

1217
01:47:29,083 --> 01:47:31,500
NIGHT ONE

1218
01:47:33,541 --> 01:47:37,666
Rishu, in Pandit's book, do you know why

1219
01:47:37,750 --> 01:47:41,500
Suraj and Arjun kept increasing the amount
of meat they fed to the crocodiles?

1220
01:47:42,458 --> 01:47:44,208
So that the crocodiles remained hungry

1221
01:47:44,291 --> 01:47:47,625
and felt they'd get more meat…

1222
01:47:49,916 --> 01:47:51,708
if they swam further away.

1223
01:47:51,791 --> 01:47:53,958
They have to be moved far away
from the railway bridge.

1224
01:47:54,041 --> 01:47:57,166
Today, we'll feed them meat
2 km away from here.

1225
01:48:25,375 --> 01:48:29,416
NIGHT TWO

1226
01:48:45,833 --> 01:48:47,416
NIGHT THREE

1227
01:48:58,458 --> 01:49:01,500
Now, 12 km of this area
is free of crocodiles.

1228
01:49:01,583 --> 01:49:05,458
Our instincts will tell us
where to come out of the water.

1229
01:49:07,791 --> 01:49:10,750
Will Rani ji jump if you ask her to?

1230
01:49:10,833 --> 01:49:12,416
Of course.

1231
01:49:12,500 --> 01:49:14,458
So much faith in your love?

1232
01:49:16,625 --> 01:49:18,541
I have faith in you too, sir.

1233
01:49:20,041 --> 01:49:22,166
That is because you love Rani so deeply

1234
01:49:22,250 --> 01:49:24,125
and you might kill me anytime.

1235
01:49:25,750 --> 01:49:27,958
The question is,
why haven't you until now?

1236
01:49:29,750 --> 01:49:32,750
Because I want Rani ji
to come to me herself.

1237
01:49:49,875 --> 01:49:51,708
-Now.
-Okay.

1238
01:49:51,791 --> 01:49:52,916
Yes.

1239
01:50:00,500 --> 01:50:01,750
If you enjoyed the story so far,

1240
01:50:01,833 --> 01:50:04,208
you'll enjoy the ending even more.

1241
01:50:04,291 --> 01:50:06,875
Come to Tota-Maina Lovers Point

1242
01:50:06,958 --> 01:50:08,666
Deosar, Himachal Pradesh,

1243
01:50:08,750 --> 01:50:10,666
at 6:00 p.m. on March 20th.

1244
01:50:11,666 --> 01:50:14,708
Make sure you walk
for 30 minutes every day.

1245
01:50:14,791 --> 01:50:16,291
Thank you, doctor.

1246
01:50:33,666 --> 01:50:35,958
"Tota-Maina Lovers Point, 6:00 p.m."

1247
01:50:48,833 --> 01:50:49,666
Goodness!

1248
01:50:52,458 --> 01:50:53,750
This is very steep.

1249
01:50:54,333 --> 01:50:55,541
Be careful.

1250
01:51:04,041 --> 01:51:05,708
Pandit writes,

1251
01:51:05,791 --> 01:51:08,916
"Color of jealousy is red, so is anger.

1252
01:51:09,750 --> 01:51:10,791
And so is blood.

1253
01:51:12,416 --> 01:51:14,750
Alas! Red is also the colour of love."

1254
01:51:16,458 --> 01:51:17,708
Pandit!

1255
01:51:18,708 --> 01:51:21,625
Such a dishonest color, isn't it?

1256
01:51:23,500 --> 01:51:25,666
There's only one red in my life.

1257
01:51:26,541 --> 01:51:28,500
The color of the rose that you're wearing.

1258
01:51:29,583 --> 01:51:31,416
You know, it has turned black now.

1259
01:51:32,500 --> 01:51:33,833
Excuse me?

1260
01:51:33,916 --> 01:51:36,875
Your rose has turned black.

1261
01:51:43,708 --> 01:51:45,708
Come here, Rani ji, we'll talk…

1262
01:51:46,916 --> 01:51:48,250
Don't come forward.

1263
01:51:49,958 --> 01:51:51,458
I'll jump.

1264
01:51:52,625 --> 01:51:53,583
Rani ji…

1265
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:56,750
Rishu was right.

1266
01:51:56,833 --> 01:51:57,875
I refused to believe him.

1267
01:51:59,500 --> 01:52:01,875
Committing murder is like a game to you.

1268
01:52:03,125 --> 01:52:04,833
Lallan, Poonam…

1269
01:52:05,583 --> 01:52:07,458
They weren't a part of our plan.

1270
01:52:08,125 --> 01:52:10,041
Lallan and Poonam were a risk.

1271
01:52:10,708 --> 01:52:13,375
Life gave me the chance
to leave everything behind

1272
01:52:13,458 --> 01:52:16,208
and start over with you, so I took it.

1273
01:52:18,833 --> 01:52:20,500
For you.

1274
01:52:20,583 --> 01:52:23,833
Tell me, haven't I made you happy?

1275
01:52:24,500 --> 01:52:25,916
You did.

1276
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:27,250
You made me very happy.

1277
01:52:27,333 --> 01:52:29,666
For the sake of those moments,

1278
01:52:30,708 --> 01:52:32,166
don't do this, please.

1279
01:52:32,791 --> 01:52:35,958
I'm willing to bear the consequences
of my actions.

1280
01:52:36,916 --> 01:52:39,041
But please don't jump. Please come here.

1281
01:52:39,125 --> 01:52:40,541
Stop this drama, boy.

1282
01:52:48,041 --> 01:52:50,958
If she really intended to jump,
she wouldn't have invited me here.

1283
01:52:52,708 --> 01:52:55,125
Why have you called me here, Rani ji?

1284
01:52:55,791 --> 01:52:59,041
So that you can get your closure, like me.

1285
01:53:09,083 --> 01:53:12,166
Both our lives are heavily influenced
by Pandit's writings.

1286
01:53:19,500 --> 01:53:20,625
Rishu…

1287
01:53:20,708 --> 01:53:21,916
Rani!

1288
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,708
-Rani ji…
-Rani.

1289
01:53:25,583 --> 01:53:26,416
Rani ji…

1290
01:53:27,583 --> 01:53:28,916
-Rani…
-Rani ji…

1291
01:53:32,541 --> 01:53:33,833
Rani ji…

1292
01:53:35,291 --> 01:53:37,166
If we want to live,

1293
01:53:37,250 --> 01:53:39,000
we'll have to die in front of the world.

1294
01:53:39,083 --> 01:53:40,708
The Crocodile's Trap.

1295
01:53:41,541 --> 01:53:43,000
Dinesh Pandit.

1296
01:53:45,750 --> 01:53:47,041
Rani…

1297
01:53:49,625 --> 01:53:50,875
No way.

1298
01:53:50,958 --> 01:53:52,708
We're not doing this again.

1299
01:53:52,791 --> 01:53:54,875
Listen to me, Rani.

1300
01:53:54,958 --> 01:53:56,750
I have known Uncle Montu since childhood.

1301
01:53:57,416 --> 01:54:01,083
He'll go to the depths of hell,
if required, to find us.

1302
01:54:01,166 --> 01:54:04,250
Do you want us to take a shortcut to hell?

1303
01:54:04,333 --> 01:54:06,583
We will not do this. No.

1304
01:54:06,666 --> 01:54:07,750
And what we've already done?

1305
01:54:09,250 --> 01:54:10,541
The Revenge of the Cobra.

1306
01:54:10,625 --> 01:54:12,375
Wrath of Kasauli.

1307
01:54:12,458 --> 01:54:16,416
Rani ji, we've been fools to mold
our lives on Pandit's books.

1308
01:54:16,500 --> 01:54:18,416
There's a difference.

1309
01:54:20,500 --> 01:54:22,958
We've learned
how to survive from Pandit's books

1310
01:54:23,041 --> 01:54:24,958
while you've learned to kill.

1311
01:54:25,041 --> 01:54:26,250
There is a difference.

1312
01:54:57,500 --> 01:54:58,333
Over there!

1313
01:56:18,500 --> 01:56:21,916
Rishu!

1314
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:23,416
-Rishu!
-Rani ji.

1315
01:56:24,458 --> 01:56:25,375
Rishu!

1316
01:56:25,458 --> 01:56:26,291
Rani ji…

1317
01:56:26,375 --> 01:56:29,625
Rishu!

1318
01:56:31,708 --> 01:56:34,791
-Rishu!
-Rani ji.

1319
01:56:36,166 --> 01:56:37,916
Rishu!

1320
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:39,416
-Rani ji.
-Rishu!

1321
01:56:43,625 --> 01:56:45,666
Rani ji…

1322
01:57:03,625 --> 01:57:04,958
Rani ji.

1323
01:57:16,083 --> 01:57:18,375
You killed Rishu!

1324
01:57:21,833 --> 01:57:24,125
You killed someone too for love.

1325
01:57:25,041 --> 01:57:26,750
Why is it so wrong if I do it?

1326
01:57:27,291 --> 01:57:29,416
I did the same thing
that you and Rishu did.

1327
01:57:30,583 --> 01:57:34,625
Then how is it that your love is right
and mine is wrong?

1328
01:57:34,708 --> 01:57:37,083
You don't even know how to love,
Abhimanyu.

1329
01:57:37,750 --> 01:57:39,416
You have never loved me.

1330
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:43,416
-No, Rani ji, I--
-All you did was play Snakes and Ladders!

1331
01:57:43,500 --> 01:57:44,500
You…

1332
01:57:45,208 --> 01:57:47,458
I made a huge mistake.

1333
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:51,416
Okay.

1334
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:53,958
Let me tell you one more truth…

1335
01:57:54,583 --> 01:57:55,666
I never thought I'd be able

1336
01:57:55,750 --> 01:57:58,333
to be with anyone else apart from Rishu.

1337
01:58:00,166 --> 01:58:01,666
After that incident,

1338
01:58:03,583 --> 01:58:04,791
I thought I could be with you.

1339
01:58:07,375 --> 01:58:10,791
I felt like we had something.

1340
01:58:14,208 --> 01:58:15,958
But this kind of betrayal

1341
01:58:19,125 --> 01:58:22,750
is too much even for me to bear.

1342
01:58:26,791 --> 01:58:28,666
I made a mistake, Rani.

1343
01:58:31,333 --> 01:58:32,916
Your punishment is…

1344
01:58:34,375 --> 01:58:36,208
I'll never be yours.

1345
01:58:37,541 --> 01:58:39,500
You have won me,

1346
01:58:41,708 --> 01:58:43,208
but you'll never win over me.

1347
01:58:48,208 --> 01:58:49,333
Rani ji, stop!

1348
01:58:49,416 --> 01:58:50,666
-Rani ji!
-Rani ji!

1349
01:58:50,750 --> 01:58:51,708
Rani ji.

1350
01:58:55,166 --> 01:58:58,833
Rani ji!

1351
01:59:04,083 --> 01:59:06,291
Send search and rescue teams right away.

1352
01:59:10,291 --> 01:59:11,583
Abhimanyu ji,

1353
01:59:11,666 --> 01:59:12,916
this way, please.

1354
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,750
You have a lot of people to account for.

1355
01:59:17,250 --> 01:59:18,541
Poonam Prajapati.

1356
01:59:18,625 --> 01:59:19,833
Lallan Barua.

1357
01:59:19,916 --> 01:59:21,958
Ashok Bharadwaj and family.

1358
01:59:22,041 --> 01:59:23,916
Rishabh Saxena

1359
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:25,958
and maybe…

1360
01:59:28,041 --> 01:59:29,333
Rani Kashyap.

1361
01:59:32,125 --> 01:59:33,291
Get him.

1362
01:59:45,916 --> 01:59:51,500
Passengers are requested to board
the aircraft from Gate No. 2. Thank you.

1363
02:00:09,500 --> 02:00:10,583
What's wrong, sir?

1364
02:00:11,791 --> 02:00:12,708
The body wasn't found?

1365
02:01:18,250 --> 02:01:21,375
I can gaze at your face, ample…

1366
02:01:21,458 --> 02:01:25,041
As you reside in my heart's temple…

1367
02:02:49,250 --> 02:02:51,208
To quote the great Pandit,

1368
02:02:51,291 --> 02:02:54,875
"Relationships thrive within
the boundaries of right and wrong.

1369
02:02:54,958 --> 02:02:59,333
True love, however,
begins where these boundaries end."

1370
02:03:10,541 --> 02:03:12,583
I'm the one who taught them

1371
02:03:13,375 --> 02:03:16,333
that if we want to live,
we'll have to die in front of the world.

1372
02:03:16,416 --> 02:03:17,791
And I'm the one who paid the price!

1373
02:03:18,750 --> 02:03:21,791
It's not yours. You're quoting a line
by a Big Daddy author.

1374
02:03:21,875 --> 02:03:25,875
The Crocodile's Trap
by the famous Dinesh Pandit.

1375
02:03:29,208 --> 02:03:30,875
Sir, how do you know

1376
02:03:32,541 --> 02:03:33,708
he's my father?

1377
02:03:43,416 --> 02:03:45,166
Amazing!
