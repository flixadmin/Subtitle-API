1
00:00:38,223 --> 00:00:45,038
Before Rome, before Babylon,
before the pyramids, there was Kahndaq.

2
00:00:45,164 --> 00:00:49,205
KAHNDAQ, 2600 BC

3
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,685
The first self-governing people on Earth,

4
00:00:54,811 --> 00:00:57,648
Kahndaq was a center of power
and enlightenment.

5
00:00:57,774 --> 00:01:00,196
For centuries, they thrived.

6
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:07,139
But then...

7
00:01:11,162 --> 00:01:13,058
came King Ahk-Ton.

8
00:01:13,911 --> 00:01:17,724
Using the army to seize power,
Ahk-Ton became a tyrant.

9
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:20,374
But he had even darker ambitions.

10
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,400
Obsessed with dark magic,

11
00:01:29,526 --> 00:01:33,848
Ahk-Ton's real goal
was to forge the Crown of Sabbac.

12
00:01:37,741 --> 00:01:42,183
If infused with the powers
of the six demons of the ancient world,

13
00:01:42,309 --> 00:01:44,328
it would make Ahk-Ton invincible.

14
00:01:45,269 --> 00:01:47,166
To make the crown, he needed Eternium.

15
00:01:47,313 --> 00:01:51,149
A rare mineral of magic properties,
found only in Kahndaq.

16
00:01:51,385 --> 00:01:53,820
So he enslaved his own people...

17
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,671
and forced them to dig.

18
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:11,287
Eternium.

19
00:02:16,716 --> 00:02:18,134
Eternium.

20
00:02:18,447 --> 00:02:20,741
Eternium.

21
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,683
Kahndaq was teetering on the brink.

22
00:02:31,353 --> 00:02:32,937
What they needed...

23
00:02:33,063 --> 00:02:35,035
Get off him.

24
00:02:35,224 --> 00:02:37,651
Get off him.

25
00:02:38,532 --> 00:02:39,783
...was a hero.

26
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:43,255
Why are we fighting each other?

27
00:02:43,382 --> 00:02:45,036
Remember who our real enemy is.

28
00:02:45,162 --> 00:02:46,776
Come with me.

29
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:51,100
Look. Eternium.

30
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,094
Let me see that.

31
00:02:58,727 --> 00:03:00,431
The king thanks you.

32
00:03:01,069 --> 00:03:02,450
He's supposed to reward him.

33
00:03:02,576 --> 00:03:03,810
Is that right?

34
00:03:04,037 --> 00:03:05,555
I want what I'm owed.

35
00:03:11,142 --> 00:03:12,610
You want a reward?

36
00:03:15,825 --> 00:03:17,537
The king thanks you for your service.

37
00:03:26,175 --> 00:03:28,495
You want the king's reward too?

38
00:03:30,223 --> 00:03:33,865
No, but my son accepts the king's mercy.

39
00:03:39,182 --> 00:03:41,858
I won't always be here to protect you.

40
00:03:42,427 --> 00:03:43,717
I don't need protection.

41
00:03:43,843 --> 00:03:45,212
I want to be free.

42
00:03:45,338 --> 00:03:47,837
If we fight together,
we could overthrow the king.

43
00:03:47,963 --> 00:03:49,619
Let someone else be the hero...

44
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:51,859
the graveyards are full of them.

45
00:03:51,985 --> 00:03:55,171
Stop dreaming and go back to work.

46
00:03:59,495 --> 00:04:02,014
Someone to hold the hopes of the people.

47
00:04:04,437 --> 00:04:06,984
Even when all hope seems lost.

48
00:04:08,364 --> 00:04:11,047
If we had more heroes...

49
00:04:11,229 --> 00:04:14,156
then maybe our freedom wouldn't be a dream.

50
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:20,001
Freedom.

51
00:04:41,902 --> 00:04:45,133
King Ahk-Ton knew that this spark
could quickley ignite a fire.

52
00:04:45,259 --> 00:04:48,152
And so he ordered that it be snuffed out.

53
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:53,985
They thought they were getting a martyr.

54
00:04:55,632 --> 00:04:57,231
Instead...

55
00:04:58,103 --> 00:04:59,718
they got a miracle.

56
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:13,036
The Council of Wizards,
the magical guardians of the earth...

57
00:05:13,162 --> 00:05:14,805
You have been chosen.

58
00:05:14,931 --> 00:05:16,834
...sought to restore the balance.

59
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,610
They empowered him with the gifts
of the ancient gods.

60
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,461
And turned a boy...

61
00:05:23,007 --> 00:05:24,617
into a champion.

62
00:05:24,747 --> 00:05:26,070
S-H-A-Z-A-M.

63
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,353
Hurry.

64
00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:30,299
Give it to me.

65
00:05:30,426 --> 00:05:32,159
But the crown had already been completed.

66
00:05:32,285 --> 00:05:34,027
Give it to me.

67
00:05:35,365 --> 00:05:38,576
And when the Champion arrived
at the palace to challange him...

68
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:41,999
King Ahk-Ton summoned
its demonic power.

69
00:05:45,922 --> 00:05:49,621
In the ensuing battle,
the palace was destroyed,

70
00:05:49,747 --> 00:05:52,387
but the Champion was victorious.

71
00:05:52,513 --> 00:05:54,210
The wizards hid the Crown of Sabbac...

72
00:05:54,337 --> 00:05:57,273
so that it would never again
fall into the hands of man.

73
00:05:57,515 --> 00:06:00,611
And the Champion
was never heard from again.

74
00:06:00,737 --> 00:06:05,134
KHANDAQ, PRESENT DAY

75
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:08,666
Today, Kahndaq is occupied
by international mercenaries,

76
00:06:08,792 --> 00:06:12,607
the Intergang, the latest
in a series of foreign invaders.

77
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:17,443
But legend says,
whenever Kahndaq needs him most,

78
00:06:17,569 --> 00:06:21,322
the Champion will return
to restore freedom to the people.

79
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:24,767
It has been a long, long wait.

80
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:39,106
Show me your papers.

81
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:44,061
INTERGANG CHECKPOINT
Sector 5 - North Shiruta.

82
00:06:44,187 --> 00:06:46,530
Have your documentation ready.

83
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,562
It's all our three documents, yeah?

84
00:06:50,693 --> 00:06:54,101
Don't judge the picture,
it's after my girlfriend broke up with me.

85
00:06:58,602 --> 00:07:01,060
Open the back. Need a look inside.

86
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:07,116
Yeah, it's unlocked, man.

87
00:07:08,498 --> 00:07:11,827
It's just a bunch of old TVs.
I'm an electrician.

88
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,483
Watch where you're going.
You know the drill, back of the line.

89
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,548
Come on, man, you see me every day.

90
00:07:25,674 --> 00:07:29,014
And every day I tell ya,
if it's got wheels, it's a vehicle.

91
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,554
Back of the line, mate.

92
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,573
You're not my mate.

93
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:35,881
I'm heartbroken. Now, go on, piss off.

94
00:07:36,007 --> 00:07:39,088
No, what you are
is a neo-imperialist enforcer,

95
00:07:39,214 --> 00:07:40,983
from halfway around the world,

96
00:07:41,109 --> 00:07:43,650
sent here to steal
my country's natural resources,

97
00:07:43,776 --> 00:07:46,198
strip-mine our sacred lands,
pollute our water,

98
00:07:46,325 --> 00:07:50,191
oppress our heritage,
and make us wait in lines all day.

99
00:07:52,078 --> 00:07:55,072
Hey, boss man. Can I go?

100
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:02,579
Go on, get out of here.

101
00:08:02,709 --> 00:08:04,193
Yeah, yeah.

102
00:08:06,434 --> 00:08:08,908
DETAIN

103
00:08:13,014 --> 00:08:14,935
Adrianna, we're clear.

104
00:08:22,256 --> 00:08:24,152
Kahndaq isn't safe for us anymore.

105
00:08:24,278 --> 00:08:26,962
Let's just move the crown first,
and then we can worry about safe.

106
00:08:27,088 --> 00:08:28,794
I got Intergang watching my house.

107
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,680
I gave up my job at the university
and moved four times.

108
00:08:31,806 --> 00:08:33,348
It doesn't mean
I'm gonna abandon my country.

109
00:08:33,372 --> 00:08:36,222
I'm just saying,
no one stays a step ahead of them forever.

110
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,422
We can't wait for things
to cool down this time.

111
00:08:38,548 --> 00:08:41,577
If I'm right,
they're days away from finding it.

112
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:48,596
- What are you doing?
- I want to come with you.

113
00:08:48,722 --> 00:08:51,435
You know it's too dangerous.
You shouldn't have gotten involved.

114
00:08:51,561 --> 00:08:54,413
Come on,
I want to help you beat those bastards.

115
00:08:54,539 --> 00:08:56,193
Adriana, keep your head down, please.

116
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,026
- You want to be a hero, huh?
- I do, yeah.

117
00:08:58,152 --> 00:09:00,226
Go home, do your homework.

118
00:09:00,353 --> 00:09:04,266
Your time will come one day,
but not today, son.

119
00:09:04,702 --> 00:09:05,589
Go.

120
00:09:05,715 --> 00:09:07,397
Go, little man. You did good.

121
00:09:37,464 --> 00:09:40,604
That would get you a fortune
on the black market.

122
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,494
Is that real Eternium?

123
00:09:43,866 --> 00:09:45,400
Show us a little magic.

124
00:09:45,526 --> 00:09:47,580
It doesn't work like that, it's unrefined.

125
00:09:47,706 --> 00:09:49,006
You guys should get some rest.

126
00:09:49,132 --> 00:09:51,377
I thought Intergang
seized all the old relics.

127
00:09:51,503 --> 00:09:52,523
Hey, come on. Stop it.

128
00:09:52,649 --> 00:09:54,173
I'm just curious how she got it.

129
00:09:54,299 --> 00:09:55,843
My grandmother gave it to me.

130
00:09:55,969 --> 00:09:58,579
- How did she get it?
- It's not a museum piece.

131
00:09:59,249 --> 00:10:00,470
It's a family heirloom,

132
00:10:00,596 --> 00:10:03,771
going all the way back to the days
when Kahndaq was free.

133
00:10:04,073 --> 00:10:05,655
You happy now?

134
00:10:05,781 --> 00:10:07,210
Cool story.

135
00:10:10,824 --> 00:10:12,795
And all I inherited was a sweater.

136
00:10:12,921 --> 00:10:15,534
That's not true.
Baba left you his van, and his bald spot.

137
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,493
You know, some women like a bald spot.

138
00:10:17,619 --> 00:10:21,161
Curly on the outside,
smooth on the inside. You know?

139
00:10:44,798 --> 00:10:46,490
Are you sure about this?

140
00:10:46,616 --> 00:10:48,564
The inscrptions we found are clear.

141
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:53,351
And I'm positive about that translation.
There is something inside that mountain.

142
00:10:56,299 --> 00:10:58,204
What if it really is the crown? Then what?

143
00:10:59,147 --> 00:11:01,392
It's a source of great power.
Who gets to keep it?

144
00:11:01,518 --> 00:11:04,516
No one. We hide it again some place else.

145
00:11:04,642 --> 00:11:08,749
Get it out of the country if we have to.
It is too dangerous for anyone to have.

146
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,291
This is it?

147
00:11:11,915 --> 00:11:13,581
Not yet.

148
00:11:15,438 --> 00:11:18,485
- Are you coming?
- Bad knee. I'll keep watch.

149
00:11:37,145 --> 00:11:41,049
This way. Almost there.

150
00:11:46,954 --> 00:11:49,708
"Men were given the gift of magic,

151
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:53,749
but their hearts
were too easily corrupted."

152
00:11:57,184 --> 00:11:58,440
Keep reading.

153
00:11:58,901 --> 00:12:03,820
"The ultimate power was banished
from the earth and hidden... here."

154
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:06,892
Until now.

155
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:10,267
This mountain has kept
the Crown of Sabbac safe for 5,000 years.

156
00:12:10,394 --> 00:12:15,933
We're 100 percent, totally, no take-backs
certain that we want to move it?

157
00:12:16,059 --> 00:12:18,071
We don't have a choice.

158
00:12:18,867 --> 00:12:20,764
What happened to Ishmael?

159
00:12:22,191 --> 00:12:25,506
Great. Don't worry, I'll find him.

160
00:12:45,841 --> 00:12:47,189
Samir?

161
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:53,449
Samir, what happened?

162
00:12:53,922 --> 00:12:55,444
What?

163
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:58,597
I can't hear you. What are you saying?

164
00:13:00,157 --> 00:13:02,703
Don't move.
Unless you want to join your mate.

165
00:13:02,829 --> 00:13:04,310
Stay where you are.

166
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:08,150
Oh, hey. Oh, hey. Hey...

167
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:14,278
"Turn back."

168
00:13:16,633 --> 00:13:18,176
That's what it says, no?

169
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,490
Yes.

170
00:13:19,616 --> 00:13:21,250
Where is Samir?

171
00:13:21,971 --> 00:13:25,130
Claustrophobic. Needed some air.

172
00:13:25,575 --> 00:13:27,814
- Is this the way to the crown?
- I think so.

173
00:13:42,132 --> 00:13:43,890
It's a tomb.

174
00:13:49,302 --> 00:13:51,145
"Speak not his power,

175
00:13:51,271 --> 00:13:55,945
so he may suffer a dreamless sleep
for all eternity" Teth Adam.

176
00:13:56,071 --> 00:13:59,150
The slave who became champion
and defeated the king.

177
00:13:59,276 --> 00:14:00,532
The legend was true.

178
00:14:00,658 --> 00:14:04,621
Kahndaq... really did have a hero once.

179
00:14:04,747 --> 00:14:08,280
If he was such a hero,
why'd they bury him down here?

180
00:14:32,326 --> 00:14:33,942
The crown.

181
00:15:17,997 --> 00:15:19,746
It's over.

182
00:15:19,872 --> 00:15:22,038
Now, give me the crown.

183
00:15:22,164 --> 00:15:24,263
Run, Addy. Run.

184
00:15:26,939 --> 00:15:28,545
Hold fire.

185
00:15:28,671 --> 00:15:31,538
Don't hit the crown. Get her.

186
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:35,803
- Go. Move.
- Circle around.

187
00:15:35,929 --> 00:15:37,834
Get down.

188
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:45,007
Say goodbye to your brother.

189
00:15:45,893 --> 00:15:47,455
In five...

190
00:15:47,859 --> 00:15:49,559
four...

191
00:15:49,685 --> 00:15:51,077
three...

192
00:15:51,203 --> 00:15:52,892
two...

193
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,234
one...

194
00:15:54,361 --> 00:15:55,695
I'm over here.

195
00:15:56,426 --> 00:15:59,437
One? You let them get to one?

196
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,923
Any last words?

197
00:16:20,324 --> 00:16:22,585
Please tell my son...

198
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,893
"Mightiest of mortals...

199
00:16:28,726 --> 00:16:30,320
god of gods,

200
00:16:30,446 --> 00:16:32,277
Six Immortal Elders by name..."

201
00:16:32,404 --> 00:16:33,146
What?

202
00:16:33,272 --> 00:16:34,272
"Shazam."

203
00:16:46,533 --> 00:16:48,435
Who the hell is that?

204
00:16:48,561 --> 00:16:51,087
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

205
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:10,112
Check him out.

206
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:11,657
Boss say you go.

207
00:17:11,783 --> 00:17:13,729
Chief say your turn.

208
00:17:25,857 --> 00:17:28,872
Hey, amigo. Let me see your hands.

209
00:17:53,071 --> 00:17:54,702
Open fire.

210
00:18:00,066 --> 00:18:01,599
Your magic is weak.

211
00:18:08,788 --> 00:18:10,515
Go. Go.

212
00:18:37,668 --> 00:18:40,487
We need immediate backup.
Send everything you've got.

213
00:18:52,567 --> 00:18:54,077
Ishmael.

214
00:19:02,978 --> 00:19:04,607
Ishmael.

215
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:32,825
- Let's go.
- This is as fast as I can go.

216
00:20:01,904 --> 00:20:04,046
Samir. What happened?

217
00:20:04,172 --> 00:20:05,716
What didn't happen.

218
00:20:05,975 --> 00:20:07,922
Samir fell off of a cliff.

219
00:20:08,048 --> 00:20:09,898
I had a gun to my head.

220
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:12,831
Ishmael is buried under a mountain.

221
00:20:14,195 --> 00:20:17,260
And you summoned some flying magic man.
All for what?

222
00:20:17,387 --> 00:20:18,930
Nothing.

223
00:20:19,733 --> 00:20:22,027
Not for nothing.

224
00:20:39,494 --> 00:20:40,976
Light him up.

225
00:20:53,066 --> 00:20:55,513
Shit. Where the hell did he come from?

226
00:20:55,639 --> 00:20:57,572
Rotor out. Go. Go.

227
00:20:58,831 --> 00:21:00,728
I can't maintain altitude.

228
00:22:28,866 --> 00:22:30,405
Oh, shit.

229
00:22:36,577 --> 00:22:38,468
Stop. Stop the van.

230
00:23:14,249 --> 00:23:16,158
Behind you.

231
00:23:19,248 --> 00:23:20,705
Did he just catch a rocket?

232
00:23:22,987 --> 00:23:24,723
ETERNIUM

233
00:23:56,236 --> 00:23:58,703
God willing, we won't see him again.

234
00:24:11,048 --> 00:24:13,722
Wait. Hey. Hey. What are you doing?

235
00:24:13,848 --> 00:24:15,650
Don't touch him, he's made of lightning.

236
00:24:16,446 --> 00:24:17,733
Good point.

237
00:24:17,859 --> 00:24:19,808
You get him, you're the electrician.

238
00:24:27,164 --> 00:24:28,953
Raptor team, come in.

239
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:30,628
What's your status?

240
00:24:33,267 --> 00:24:34,751
Help me.

241
00:24:34,877 --> 00:24:39,253
I told you to make it look real,
not punch me in the face.

242
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:44,641
Raptor team, come in. What is your status?

243
00:24:44,767 --> 00:24:46,680
Status is that everyone is dead.

244
00:24:46,806 --> 00:24:49,079
Ishmael, is that you? What happened?

245
00:24:49,205 --> 00:24:53,570
The crown wasn't the only thing
waiting for us down here.

246
00:24:53,696 --> 00:24:56,810
- Do you have it?
- No. But I know who does.

247
00:24:56,936 --> 00:24:59,288
Copy that.
We're en route to your location.

248
00:25:01,603 --> 00:25:04,016
We need immediate backup.
Send everything you've got.

249
00:25:04,142 --> 00:25:07,099
This rare, magical mineral
has been mined for centuries...

250
00:25:07,225 --> 00:25:10,244
...reports of an Eternium blast.
It is unknown who or why...

251
00:25:10,371 --> 00:25:12,611
...has decimated a number of troops.
We are waiting on...

252
00:25:12,701 --> 00:25:15,385
...an unidentified male.
This being is somehow able to harness...

253
00:25:15,511 --> 00:25:16,935
What do you think?

254
00:25:17,061 --> 00:25:19,966
I think this loose cannon
needs to be locked down...

255
00:25:20,092 --> 00:25:22,087
before innocent people start getting hurt.

256
00:25:22,213 --> 00:25:23,946
Oh, and good mornig to you, too.

257
00:25:24,072 --> 00:25:25,312
Shove it up your ass, Carter.

258
00:25:25,438 --> 00:25:28,141
He's been asleep for 5,000 years.

259
00:25:28,268 --> 00:25:30,164
He'll be disoriented at first.

260
00:25:30,291 --> 00:25:34,521
The longer he has to adapt,
the harder it will be to take him down.

261
00:25:35,101 --> 00:25:36,751
Wheels up in 30.

262
00:25:36,877 --> 00:25:38,101
Who's on the team?

263
00:25:48,832 --> 00:25:51,549
Welcome.
Please state your name for identification.

264
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:55,124
Hi. I'm Maxine Hunkel.
I'm here to see Mr Hall.

265
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:56,853
Confirmed. Welcome, Maxine.

266
00:25:56,979 --> 00:25:57,832
Thanks.

267
00:25:57,958 --> 00:26:00,327
Maxine Hunkel, aka Cyclone.

268
00:26:00,453 --> 00:26:04,168
Wind manipulation powers,
computer skills, smart as hell.

269
00:26:04,295 --> 00:26:07,844
Basically a tornado with a 167 IQ.

270
00:26:07,969 --> 00:26:09,741
Sounds delightful.

271
00:26:09,867 --> 00:26:13,570
But please tell me you found someone
who can pack a punch.

272
00:26:13,696 --> 00:26:15,592
That's where Atom Smasher comes in.

273
00:26:15,718 --> 00:26:18,676
Al Rothstein,
nephew to the original Atom Smasher.

274
00:26:18,802 --> 00:26:20,737
He inherited his uncle's powers.

275
00:26:20,863 --> 00:26:22,110
Uncle Al.

276
00:26:22,236 --> 00:26:23,459
How's my suit? Does it fit?

277
00:26:23,585 --> 00:26:26,167
No, yeah. It's perfect.
Thank you again for letting me borrow it.

278
00:26:26,294 --> 00:26:28,314
You know,
I used to watch you all the time as a kid?

279
00:26:28,338 --> 00:26:30,778
This is literally the only thing
that I'd ever wanted in my...

280
00:26:30,876 --> 00:26:32,847
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Don't let anything happen to it.

281
00:26:32,973 --> 00:26:34,067
It's Vintage.

282
00:26:34,193 --> 00:26:35,572
And don't let anything
happen to you, either.

283
00:26:35,596 --> 00:26:37,583
Don't do anything crazy.
You listen to Carter.

284
00:26:37,709 --> 00:26:40,329
I'm gonna make you proud, Uncle Al.
I promise.

285
00:26:42,651 --> 00:26:43,897
They seem green.

286
00:26:44,023 --> 00:26:45,553
That's why I called in Kent.

287
00:26:47,902 --> 00:26:49,956
Кent's been out of action
for a little while,

288
00:26:50,082 --> 00:26:51,716
but I can't do this without him.

289
00:26:51,842 --> 00:26:56,641
Takes magic to fight magic
and the man's got nearly god-level powers.

290
00:27:01,678 --> 00:27:05,941
It might take a lot than that.
Are you sure they can take him?

291
00:27:06,067 --> 00:27:08,627
Waller, you find us a cell
that can hold him...

292
00:27:09,091 --> 00:27:10,802
we'll take care of the rest.

293
00:27:10,928 --> 00:27:12,145
Good luck.

294
00:27:17,514 --> 00:27:19,833
This is gonna be fun.

295
00:27:35,551 --> 00:27:37,288
We're here, sir.

296
00:27:37,414 --> 00:27:38,823
Oh, right.

297
00:27:42,895 --> 00:27:44,400
Was I staring again?

298
00:27:44,526 --> 00:27:46,686
Only half an hour or so, sir.

299
00:27:47,309 --> 00:27:48,978
Maybe next time, honk the horn.

300
00:27:49,104 --> 00:27:50,688
Of course, sir.

301
00:27:58,663 --> 00:28:02,226
HAWKMAN'S ESTATE
SAINT ROCH, LOUISIANA

302
00:28:05,645 --> 00:28:06,890
So what's the op?

303
00:28:07,016 --> 00:28:09,384
We're headed to Kahndaq to
apprehend and contain...

304
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:11,113
a Class-A rogue met a human.

305
00:28:11,239 --> 00:28:12,453
I didn't bring passport.

306
00:28:12,579 --> 00:28:17,423
We don't need passports.
We're the Justice Society.

307
00:28:24,318 --> 00:28:26,697
Is this entirely made out of Nth metal?

308
00:28:26,823 --> 00:28:31,336
Everyting down to the screws.
Completely indestructible.

309
00:28:31,558 --> 00:28:34,020
I'll be in the cockpit if you need me.

310
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:38,235
It's pretty cool. You got any snacks?

311
00:28:40,245 --> 00:28:42,827
It takes a lot of energy to smash atoms.

312
00:28:55,855 --> 00:28:57,084
Here.

313
00:28:57,832 --> 00:28:59,280
Oh. Thanks.

314
00:29:01,034 --> 00:29:02,621
I'm Al, by the way.

315
00:29:02,747 --> 00:29:04,532
Мaxine.

316
00:29:09,653 --> 00:29:11,038
What do you do?

317
00:29:11,164 --> 00:29:12,641
Wind. You?

318
00:29:12,767 --> 00:29:13,995
I grow.

319
00:29:14,792 --> 00:29:16,058
Сool.

320
00:30:00,592 --> 00:30:03,480
Don't worry about that.
I can get another one.

321
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:10,419
My mom's not much of a doctor,
but you should probably leave th...

322
00:30:11,708 --> 00:30:13,352
Or do that.

323
00:30:17,423 --> 00:30:19,146
I know you have a lot to catch up on.

324
00:30:19,273 --> 00:30:21,337
But, I was thinking
we could help each other.

325
00:30:21,463 --> 00:30:23,528
- Мove.
- I'm Amon, by the way.

326
00:30:23,654 --> 00:30:25,214
I didn't ask for your name.

327
00:30:25,341 --> 00:30:28,127
You're Teth Adam, right?
Everyone in Kahndaq knows your story.

328
00:30:28,254 --> 00:30:29,257
I said move.

329
00:30:29,383 --> 00:30:31,956
My mom said you took out a bunch
of Intergang soldiers in the desert.

330
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,519
Because they wouldn't move out of my way.

331
00:30:33,543 --> 00:30:36,458
So you can really fly and stop bullets,
'cause that's really crucial to my plan.

332
00:30:36,482 --> 00:30:38,459
And is it really you stopping the bullets
or is it the suit?

333
00:30:38,483 --> 00:30:39,511
Wait, what's your top speed?

334
00:30:39,535 --> 00:30:42,116
I'm sure you're fast, but how fast?
Like Flash fast?

335
00:30:48,607 --> 00:30:50,860
Wait, did you not have
mirrors back then?

336
00:30:52,353 --> 00:30:54,879
Wow, I guess a lot does change
in 5,000 years.

337
00:30:57,422 --> 00:30:59,319
Five thousand years?

338
00:30:59,445 --> 00:31:00,791
Yeah, that's how long
you were in the tomb.

339
00:31:00,815 --> 00:31:02,418
Until my mom woke you up.

340
00:31:02,544 --> 00:31:05,344
So you've got stopping bullets, check;
Flying, check;

341
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:07,893
And lighting thing, that's a big check.

342
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,410
I don't know this place.

343
00:31:14,536 --> 00:31:16,087
This is your home.

344
00:31:19,541 --> 00:31:21,724
Then my home is gone.

345
00:31:36,896 --> 00:31:38,390
What happened to the crown?

346
00:31:39,001 --> 00:31:40,014
Too much?

347
00:31:44,349 --> 00:31:46,576
You know it's cursed with demons, right?

348
00:31:56,657 --> 00:32:01,984
"Life is the... only path to death."

349
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:04,004
No shit.

350
00:32:07,385 --> 00:32:10,671
"Teth Adam was a Bronze Age
Kahndaqi Demi-god."

351
00:32:10,797 --> 00:32:14,677
"He defeated King Ahk-Ton
in approximately 2,600 BC."

352
00:32:14,803 --> 00:32:16,656
There. That's you. See?

353
00:32:16,782 --> 00:32:19,022
That's the statue they built of you.
And now you're back.

354
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:20,733
Our country's been oppressed
by one invader...

355
00:32:20,757 --> 00:32:23,155
after another over since you left.

356
00:32:23,282 --> 00:32:26,349
My point is, Kahndaq still isn't free.

357
00:32:26,475 --> 00:32:28,872
We could really use a superhero
right about now.

358
00:32:29,289 --> 00:32:31,061
I'm no hero.

359
00:32:31,187 --> 00:32:32,399
What?

360
00:32:32,525 --> 00:32:35,755
Superman, Batman, Aquaman...
You're way more stacked than any of them.

361
00:32:35,881 --> 00:32:38,245
And they're not coming
to Kahndaq to save us.

362
00:32:38,371 --> 00:32:40,386
But you could stop Intergang
all by yourself,

363
00:32:40,512 --> 00:32:41,766
just like you did King Ahk-Ton.

364
00:32:41,892 --> 00:32:43,332
You're our only hope.

365
00:33:07,647 --> 00:33:08,938
Wizards.

366
00:33:09,778 --> 00:33:11,509
I can fix it. Don't worry.

367
00:33:13,419 --> 00:33:15,161
I'm not a wizard.

368
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:19,449
Hey, Mom. He's awake.

369
00:33:19,808 --> 00:33:21,647
I told you not to go in your room.

370
00:33:22,479 --> 00:33:23,950
It was you who spoke.

371
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,265
You woke me.

372
00:33:27,391 --> 00:33:30,448
I didn't have a choice.
I'd be dead if it hadn't worked.

373
00:33:30,574 --> 00:33:32,517
The men in my tomb,
they were your enemies?

374
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:34,376
Then your enemies are vanquished,

375
00:33:34,502 --> 00:33:36,516
condemned to the eternal sleep
of the damned.

376
00:33:36,642 --> 00:33:39,122
Actually, we still have a lot of enemies
that need vanquishing.

377
00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:40,083
Then destroy them.

378
00:33:40,209 --> 00:33:43,183
Intergang have guns and fly bikes
and Eternium rockets.

379
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:44,751
We have my mom.

380
00:33:45,858 --> 00:33:48,997
Prove your strength.
Destroy your enemy and all he cares about.

381
00:33:49,123 --> 00:33:52,427
Make him beg for mercy,
but deny it until his final breath.

382
00:33:52,553 --> 00:33:54,196
Interesting, okay?

383
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:55,865
I appreciate what you did to for me,

384
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:59,125
but I do not
want you teaching my son violence.

385
00:34:00,193 --> 00:34:04,109
I understand.
You want his father to teach him violence.

386
00:34:04,236 --> 00:34:06,053
- Gross, that's my brother.
- That's my sister.

387
00:34:06,179 --> 00:34:08,290
- His father's dead.
- I'm sorry.

388
00:34:09,656 --> 00:34:11,410
Who do you want
to teach him violence then?

389
00:34:11,536 --> 00:34:14,117
Yeah, Mom.
Who do you want to teach me violence?

390
00:34:14,244 --> 00:34:14,954
No one.

391
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:20,335
I want a champion
to help free Kahndaq from Intergang.

392
00:34:20,969 --> 00:34:22,636
Please, help us.

393
00:34:40,589 --> 00:34:42,485
Wait. Wait.

394
00:34:43,188 --> 00:34:45,630
- Where are you going?
- I shouldn't be here.

395
00:34:46,175 --> 00:34:48,312
You don't feel any loyalty to us at all?

396
00:34:48,438 --> 00:34:49,547
Not really, no.

397
00:34:49,673 --> 00:34:51,564
You're not seeing
the full possibilities here.

398
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:53,133
I don't know what is was like
in ancient times,

399
00:34:53,157 --> 00:34:55,698
but having superpowers
is kind of a big deal in our world.

400
00:34:55,824 --> 00:34:58,588
Maybe clean up your outfit a little bit,
get a cape, change your name.

401
00:34:58,714 --> 00:35:00,545
Teth Adam is a very strong name.

402
00:35:00,671 --> 00:35:03,274
It's a little outdated.
And you definitely need a catchphrase.

403
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,914
Something blackout bad-ass to say,

404
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,060
right before you absolutely
cook some dude.

405
00:35:07,186 --> 00:35:08,702
I don't waste words on the dead.

406
00:35:08,828 --> 00:35:10,650
Well, yeah, kind of like that,
but more catchy.

407
00:35:10,674 --> 00:35:14,183
I was thinking, like,
"Tell them the Man in the Black sent you."

408
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:15,788
- Them?
- You know, gods, demons...

409
00:35:15,914 --> 00:35:17,325
Whoever's waiting for us in the afterlife.

410
00:35:17,349 --> 00:35:19,678
And you wear a lot of black,
so we should really lean into that.

411
00:35:19,702 --> 00:35:22,052
My point is, you could be famous.

412
00:35:22,178 --> 00:35:24,460
Magazines, lunch boxes, video games.

413
00:35:24,586 --> 00:35:27,224
And the superhero industrial complex
is worth a lot of money.

414
00:35:27,351 --> 00:35:29,350
I don't need a box for my lunch.

415
00:35:29,476 --> 00:35:31,334
Anyone you've ever known is dead.

416
00:35:34,045 --> 00:35:36,113
What else are you gonna do?

417
00:35:40,316 --> 00:35:43,158
Wait. Where are you going?

418
00:35:58,031 --> 00:36:00,882
Waller's file needs a bit to be desired.

419
00:36:01,008 --> 00:36:04,734
Most of this was considered a myth
until yesterday afternoon.

420
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:07,624
He's a bad man, Kent.
What else do you need to know?

421
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:10,164
When you've seen
as many different futures as I have,

422
00:36:10,291 --> 00:36:12,234
you cease to believe in absolutes.

423
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,562
What are you laughing at?

424
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:18,781
I'm not laughing. That was a smirk.

425
00:36:18,907 --> 00:36:21,210
I know. That's how you laugh.

426
00:36:21,337 --> 00:36:25,774
I've missed having you around
to spout old cryptic shit like that.

427
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:29,341
Almost as much as I've missed
having you around to ignore all my advice.

428
00:36:29,467 --> 00:36:30,689
Carter...

429
00:36:31,835 --> 00:36:33,895
This is not a very good plan.

430
00:36:37,587 --> 00:36:39,483
Yeah, well...

431
00:36:39,609 --> 00:36:42,766
A bad plan is better than no plan at all.

432
00:36:44,065 --> 00:36:46,406
If only there were a third option.

433
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:51,869
I wouldn't touch that if I was you.

434
00:36:51,995 --> 00:36:53,268
Why not?

435
00:36:53,394 --> 00:36:55,659
'Cause that helmet is from another planet.

436
00:36:55,785 --> 00:36:57,072
It's millions of years old.

437
00:36:57,198 --> 00:36:58,768
It chooses who it lets touch it.

438
00:36:59,824 --> 00:37:01,397
- Like Kent?
- Yeah.

439
00:37:01,523 --> 00:37:05,023
Like, Kent is leterally possessed
when he puts it on.

440
00:37:05,227 --> 00:37:06,697
What happens if I touch it anyway?

441
00:37:06,823 --> 00:37:10,175
Soul crushing terror? Or... something.

442
00:37:10,302 --> 00:37:12,737
So we should probably
put a towel on it, right?

443
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:14,426
Coming up on it.

444
00:37:14,552 --> 00:37:16,511
Ready stations in five.

445
00:37:16,636 --> 00:37:19,141
Hey, why is this Adam dude so pissed off?

446
00:37:19,268 --> 00:37:20,566
He's not some dude.

447
00:37:20,692 --> 00:37:23,446
He's a weapon of mass destruction.

448
00:37:23,572 --> 00:37:25,151
You don't have to raise your hand.

449
00:37:25,278 --> 00:37:28,244
Question: If he's so powerful,
how are we supposed to stop him?

450
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:31,117
If we can get him to say the word,
"Shazam,".

451
00:37:31,244 --> 00:37:33,552
Teth Adam will lose his power.

452
00:37:33,678 --> 00:37:37,372
And we're hoping since he's had
a few thousand years to sleep it off,

453
00:37:37,498 --> 00:37:40,720
we can peacefully negotiate
the terms of his existence.

454
00:37:40,846 --> 00:37:42,086
From the footage you showed us,

455
00:37:42,157 --> 00:37:44,872
he doesn't really seem
like a "peacefully negotiate" kind of guy.

456
00:37:44,998 --> 00:37:46,202
Correct.

457
00:37:46,329 --> 00:37:47,846
Look alive.

458
00:37:49,886 --> 00:37:51,124
We're here.

459
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:54,382
ENTERING KAHNDAQI AIRSPACE

460
00:38:32,668 --> 00:38:34,612
Forgive me.

461
00:38:48,357 --> 00:38:50,592
This is a message
for all Intergang soldiers.

462
00:38:50,718 --> 00:38:53,455
Kahndaq has its own
official superhero now.

463
00:39:17,365 --> 00:39:18,684
Тeth Adam.

464
00:39:20,798 --> 00:39:22,119
Please.

465
00:39:22,406 --> 00:39:25,231
There he is. Move.

466
00:39:25,936 --> 00:39:27,590
- Тeth Adam.
- Move.

467
00:39:28,257 --> 00:39:29,720
Тeth Adam...

468
00:39:31,717 --> 00:39:33,736
Who's gonna save you now, mate?

469
00:39:36,606 --> 00:39:37,861
The statue?

470
00:39:39,699 --> 00:39:41,072
That's my son.

471
00:39:41,198 --> 00:39:43,770
He's just a boy.
He doesn't know what he's doing.

472
00:39:44,518 --> 00:39:46,173
What are you doing?

473
00:39:46,452 --> 00:39:49,401
Hang on. I recognize you.

474
00:39:49,527 --> 00:39:51,188
Where is the crown?

475
00:39:52,567 --> 00:39:54,090
Let's go.

476
00:40:08,288 --> 00:40:11,128
You could've showed up a bit sooner.
But that was dope.

477
00:40:16,277 --> 00:40:18,114
We need backup down here.

478
00:40:58,482 --> 00:41:00,083
Tell them the Man in Black sent you.

479
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:03,513
Well, yes, but not to me.
Say it to the bad guys.

480
00:41:04,194 --> 00:41:05,714
But before you zap them.

481
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,539
- Catchphrase, then kill.
- Yes.

482
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:31,371
He's here.

483
00:41:31,497 --> 00:41:32,570
You sense his presence?

484
00:41:32,696 --> 00:41:34,195
No.

485
00:41:34,816 --> 00:41:38,201
I assume he's the only person
in Kahndaq that can do that.

486
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:51,712
Fate and I'll take the lead. Listen.

487
00:41:51,838 --> 00:41:53,777
Now, you two hang back 'til we call you.

488
00:41:53,903 --> 00:41:56,524
We're the anvil, you're the hammer.
You're ready.

489
00:41:57,496 --> 00:41:59,650
He just dropped the...

490
00:42:00,179 --> 00:42:01,431
Shit.

491
00:42:06,613 --> 00:42:08,392
Be prepared.

492
00:42:28,842 --> 00:42:30,302
Behind you.

493
00:42:43,892 --> 00:42:45,441
Let us be.

494
00:42:46,447 --> 00:42:47,930
I don't know their crimes,

495
00:42:48,056 --> 00:42:51,404
but whatever they are,
these men should face due process.

496
00:42:55,018 --> 00:42:56,804
Then let the gods make their judgment.

497
00:42:56,930 --> 00:42:58,391
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

498
00:42:58,517 --> 00:43:00,276
You don't look like an Intergang.

499
00:43:00,402 --> 00:43:02,946
We're the Justice Society.

500
00:43:03,072 --> 00:43:06,116
Our mission is to protect
global stability.

501
00:43:06,243 --> 00:43:09,455
We're here to restore peace to Kahndaq.

502
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:13,695
And we will use force if necessary.

503
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:16,950
Force is always necessary.

504
00:43:17,076 --> 00:43:18,398
Teth Adam.

505
00:43:18,524 --> 00:43:21,951
We know who you are
and what you are capable of.

506
00:43:22,077 --> 00:43:25,584
There's no place for you
in the world of man.

507
00:43:25,944 --> 00:43:30,483
You have two choices: Kneel or die.

508
00:43:31,034 --> 00:43:33,054
I was a slave until I died.

509
00:43:34,886 --> 00:43:36,849
Then I was reborn a god.

510
00:43:38,255 --> 00:43:40,225
I kneel before no one.

511
00:43:47,241 --> 00:43:49,260
Fate, give me a distraction.

512
00:44:42,164 --> 00:44:45,719
Just say, "Shazam." We all go home.

513
00:44:47,277 --> 00:44:49,056
I don't have a home.

514
00:45:22,973 --> 00:45:24,342
Look at that suit. It's cool.

515
00:45:24,468 --> 00:45:25,468
Thanks. You, too.

516
00:45:25,505 --> 00:45:28,307
Thank you. It was a hand-me-down.
It was from my uncle.

517
00:45:34,679 --> 00:45:37,400
- Hawkman just does not give up, does he?
- Nope.

518
00:45:50,519 --> 00:45:52,974
Amon, where are you going? Wait.

519
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:54,661
To help him.

520
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:17,739
Cyclone, Smasher, now is your time.

521
00:46:17,865 --> 00:46:19,224
Let's roll.

522
00:46:19,350 --> 00:46:21,369
What are you doing? Hey.

523
00:47:03,922 --> 00:47:05,719
No.

524
00:47:09,449 --> 00:47:10,679
I'll be right there.

525
00:47:20,013 --> 00:47:22,080
You have the Crown of Sabbac.

526
00:48:05,124 --> 00:48:07,317
I can't hold him much longer.

527
00:48:12,576 --> 00:48:13,802
Move.

528
00:48:34,949 --> 00:48:37,866
I'm coming.
I'm zeroing in on your location.

529
00:49:09,167 --> 00:49:11,795
I got him. Guys, I got him.

530
00:49:12,195 --> 00:49:15,692
It's me, Al.
In case you didn't recognize me.

531
00:49:15,818 --> 00:49:18,641
There's something different about you.
Can't quite put my finger on it.

532
00:49:18,767 --> 00:49:20,910
You know, it's probably because
I'm six stories tall now.

533
00:49:20,934 --> 00:49:22,254
But you... You're like a tornado.

534
00:49:22,344 --> 00:49:24,603
I thought the two of you did great work.

535
00:49:24,729 --> 00:49:26,939
First time out... Bravo.

536
00:49:27,065 --> 00:49:29,388
Thanks. I mean,
I got a little turned around back there,

537
00:49:29,514 --> 00:49:30,743
but, it all worked out, right?

538
00:49:30,869 --> 00:49:32,263
You're damn right it did.

539
00:49:32,389 --> 00:49:34,984
Let's hope Waller
has that cell ready for him.

540
00:49:40,288 --> 00:49:42,767
You want me to keep my hand here, right?

541
00:49:42,893 --> 00:49:44,912
You'd better not let him up.

542
00:49:45,930 --> 00:49:49,452
What do I do? Guys?

543
00:50:05,461 --> 00:50:10,350
Long live the Champion.
Long live the Champion.

544
00:50:10,476 --> 00:50:12,494
Long live the Champion.

545
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:14,815
Long live the Champion.

546
00:50:22,387 --> 00:50:25,681
Yeah, he's definitely still breathing.

547
00:50:25,807 --> 00:50:29,970
Long live the Champion.
Long live the Champion.

548
00:50:48,547 --> 00:50:50,487
Where are you going?
We need to go after him.

549
00:50:50,613 --> 00:50:51,912
We're not strong enough.

550
00:50:52,038 --> 00:50:54,652
Oh, well, maybe next time
use your powers of prediction...

551
00:50:54,778 --> 00:50:57,037
to figure that out
before we gor our asses kicked.

552
00:50:57,163 --> 00:50:58,504
I'm working on it.

553
00:50:58,630 --> 00:50:59,877
Miss?

554
00:51:00,003 --> 00:51:01,825
Excuse me, you mind if I look in your bag?

555
00:51:01,951 --> 00:51:03,281
Yes, I do mind.

556
00:51:03,407 --> 00:51:04,840
Where are you going with this, Kent?

557
00:51:04,864 --> 00:51:06,170
She's got the Crown of Sabbac.

558
00:51:06,296 --> 00:51:09,615
One catastrophe at a time.
We can't give him a chance to regroup.

559
00:51:09,741 --> 00:51:11,415
He's been spotted entering the palace.

560
00:51:11,541 --> 00:51:13,477
It safe to say
he's not going there to surrender.

561
00:51:13,603 --> 00:51:15,307
Why do you want Teth Adam to surrender?

562
00:51:15,433 --> 00:51:17,493
He's the Champion of Kahndaq? Who are you?

563
00:51:17,619 --> 00:51:18,922
The Justice Society?

564
00:51:19,281 --> 00:51:23,182
We have been living under
military occupation for 27 years,

565
00:51:23,308 --> 00:51:24,539
and never seen you before.

566
00:51:24,665 --> 00:51:27,201
You didn't come when Intergang
invaded our country,

567
00:51:27,327 --> 00:51:29,934
when they stole our resources
and killed my husband.

568
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:32,406
But now, we finally have our own hero...

569
00:51:32,532 --> 00:51:35,485
and you decide to fly down here
and save us?

570
00:51:35,611 --> 00:51:38,253
Thank you, but... we're covered.

571
00:51:38,379 --> 00:51:41,921
Go and protect inernational stability
some place else.

572
00:51:42,047 --> 00:51:44,612
Oh, and second, I don't have the crown.

573
00:51:44,738 --> 00:51:46,359
Let me spell it out for you.

574
00:51:46,485 --> 00:51:50,228
Teth Adam can't be Kahndaq's champion
because he is not a hero.

575
00:51:50,354 --> 00:51:52,055
Tell that...

576
00:51:52,182 --> 00:51:56,033
to all the people he just liberated.

577
00:51:56,584 --> 00:51:58,714
I know what this looks like. I do.

578
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:00,370
But I can assure you that my t...

579
00:52:03,550 --> 00:52:06,287
I am so sorry. Was that expensive?

580
00:52:07,653 --> 00:52:10,206
Me and you.
When we get back to the ship...

581
00:52:10,332 --> 00:52:12,228
- Yes, sir.
- Me and you.

582
00:52:12,354 --> 00:52:13,879
I...

583
00:52:14,377 --> 00:52:16,273
Can we please just see the crown?

584
00:52:16,732 --> 00:52:18,227
I don't have it.

585
00:52:36,802 --> 00:52:38,235
We don't have time for this.

586
00:52:38,361 --> 00:52:40,294
Teth Adam first, then the crown.

587
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:43,997
You don't have any authority here.
Teth Adam has done nothing...

588
00:52:44,123 --> 00:52:46,840
Teth Adam is not who you think he is.

589
00:52:46,966 --> 00:52:48,329
And how whould you know?

590
00:52:48,455 --> 00:52:51,991
We have access to ancient texts
that have been kept secret for centuries.

591
00:52:52,117 --> 00:52:54,664
And what exactly do these
supposed ancient texts say?

592
00:52:54,790 --> 00:52:57,889
They say that his rage
nearly destroyed Kahndaq.

593
00:52:58,785 --> 00:53:02,793
And we flew all the way over here
to stop it from happening again.

594
00:53:05,570 --> 00:53:08,258
You want to go in there alone?
Are you sure?

595
00:53:08,384 --> 00:53:11,427
You want to go in and fight
Teth Adam again, be my guest.

596
00:53:11,574 --> 00:53:14,073
But if you actually want
to resolve things peacefully,

597
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:18,137
without destroying the rest of my city,
I'm your only shot.

598
00:53:40,568 --> 00:53:42,044
You brought the invaders with you.

599
00:53:42,419 --> 00:53:44,075
They only want to talk.

600
00:53:44,631 --> 00:53:48,139
They can talk. I won't listen.

601
00:53:49,912 --> 00:53:52,382
When I was a little girl,
my grandmother told me the story...

602
00:53:52,508 --> 00:53:55,460
of how the Champion came
to this exact spot...

603
00:53:55,586 --> 00:53:59,480
to free the enslaved people of Kahndaq
by defeating King Ahk-Ton in battle.

604
00:53:59,606 --> 00:54:02,953
But according to the Justice Society,
that's not really what happened.

605
00:54:03,079 --> 00:54:06,124
They say that you didn't come here
to seek justice.

606
00:54:08,615 --> 00:54:10,160
Hurry.

607
00:54:10,286 --> 00:54:11,742
Give it to me.

608
00:54:15,239 --> 00:54:17,860
That you came to exact revenge.

609
00:54:33,253 --> 00:54:35,038
And in your anger...

610
00:54:36,289 --> 00:54:40,354
Don't kill me.
I can give you anything you want.

611
00:54:42,149 --> 00:54:43,542
This is what I want.

612
00:54:43,668 --> 00:54:46,814
...your power grew
until it became uncontrollable.

613
00:54:53,878 --> 00:54:57,154
And the Council of Wizards
was forced to deem you unworthy...

614
00:54:57,281 --> 00:54:59,177
of the gifts that you were granted.

615
00:54:59,527 --> 00:55:01,530
We have chosen recklessly...

616
00:55:01,656 --> 00:55:03,412
and humanity has paid the price.

617
00:55:03,863 --> 00:55:05,448
And now, Teth Adam...

618
00:55:05,574 --> 00:55:08,058
you must pay.

619
00:55:26,878 --> 00:55:29,911
It wasn't your tomb that I opened, was it?

620
00:55:32,539 --> 00:55:34,646
It was your prison.

621
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:37,840
And now there's a statue of you.

622
00:55:38,253 --> 00:55:41,801
Out of the hope that someday
Kahndaq's champion would return.

623
00:55:41,927 --> 00:55:43,697
But it's built on a lie, isn't it.

624
00:55:43,823 --> 00:55:45,898
I never said I was a hero.

625
00:55:46,024 --> 00:55:47,742
I never claimed to be anything.

626
00:55:48,108 --> 00:55:50,292
You may not have been a hero.

627
00:55:50,666 --> 00:55:53,327
But that doesn't mean
that you can't be one now.

628
00:56:00,848 --> 00:56:02,183
I will hear them out.

629
00:56:02,309 --> 00:56:05,323
But if they choose to fight,
they choose to die.

630
00:56:10,228 --> 00:56:11,449
Uncle Karim.

631
00:56:11,575 --> 00:56:13,473
I can't believe you're sitting around
watching TV...

632
00:56:13,497 --> 00:56:14,985
when the most epic day ever is...

633
00:56:15,111 --> 00:56:16,784
In here, little man.

634
00:56:19,134 --> 00:56:21,772
Ishmael. My mom said
you got buried in the tomb.

635
00:56:21,898 --> 00:56:23,437
Funny story, he didn't.

636
00:56:23,563 --> 00:56:25,201
Where's Adrianna?

637
00:56:25,327 --> 00:56:27,761
- She's back at the square...
- We should go bail her out right now.

638
00:56:27,785 --> 00:56:30,011
But she's the one who sent me home
to make sure the crown's safe.

639
00:56:30,035 --> 00:56:31,720
It is safe, okay? Somewhere else.

640
00:56:31,846 --> 00:56:34,260
Definitely not here. Let... Okay...

641
00:56:34,386 --> 00:56:35,878
- Put the bag down.
- What are you doing?

642
00:56:35,902 --> 00:56:38,415
Back away. Put the bag down, now.

643
00:56:41,709 --> 00:56:43,307
Give him the bag. Give hime the bag.

644
00:56:45,218 --> 00:56:46,701
Very good. Back away.

645
00:56:47,491 --> 00:56:50,240
- Back away.
- Oké. I'm...

646
00:56:59,288 --> 00:57:01,436
It's all going to be okay, little man.

647
00:57:01,562 --> 00:57:03,787
Let me teach you some history
that you've never learned...

648
00:57:03,811 --> 00:57:05,091
in one of your mother's classes.

649
00:57:05,214 --> 00:57:06,736
When we had a powerful king,

650
00:57:06,862 --> 00:57:10,326
Kahndaq used to be something
much better than free.

651
00:57:10,452 --> 00:57:11,855
It used to be great.

652
00:57:11,981 --> 00:57:13,496
Run, Amon, run.

653
00:57:32,201 --> 00:57:35,204
Crash the building.
I lost the kid. He has the crown.

654
00:57:51,024 --> 00:57:55,237
We're here to negotoiate the terms
of your peaceful surrender.

655
00:57:55,632 --> 00:57:59,299
I'm not peaceful. Nor do I surrender.

656
00:57:59,425 --> 00:58:02,920
What have your powers ever given to you?
Nothing but heartache.

657
00:58:03,450 --> 00:58:04,604
You have no idea.

658
00:58:04,730 --> 00:58:06,664
Then why are you making this hard on us?

659
00:58:06,790 --> 00:58:08,920
We both know
you're not supposed to be here.

660
00:58:09,046 --> 00:58:11,454
It is you who is not supposed to be here.

661
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:13,970
I want you all to leave
Kahndaq and never return.

662
00:58:14,096 --> 00:58:17,701
Gladly, with you as our prisoner.

663
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:20,510
How 'bout I rip
you little wings off instead?

664
00:58:20,761 --> 00:58:24,154
- I'd like to see you try.
- Okay, more fighting won't solve this.

665
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:25,542
- I disagree.
- Me, too.

666
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:27,095
Looks like we found common ground.

667
00:58:27,221 --> 00:58:29,320
This can only end one way.

668
00:58:30,534 --> 00:58:31,902
- Мom?
- Amon.

669
00:58:32,028 --> 00:58:33,879
I got home and Ishmael was in the kitchen.

670
00:58:34,005 --> 00:58:35,222
Ishmael's dead.

671
00:58:35,348 --> 00:58:38,001
No, he shot Uncle Karim,
and he's after the crown.

672
00:58:38,791 --> 00:58:39,986
Ground forces...

673
00:58:40,112 --> 00:58:42,407
I'm hiding in our building,
and Intergang's here.

674
00:58:42,533 --> 00:58:44,142
They're coming.

675
00:58:44,268 --> 00:58:46,002
Intergang are after my son.

676
00:58:46,128 --> 00:58:49,149
They don't want him,
they want the Crown of Sabbac.

677
00:58:49,275 --> 00:58:50,856
I know you're not a hero.

678
00:58:50,982 --> 00:58:53,502
But you're not a monster, either.
I don't care what anyone says.

679
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:55,613
You saved me in that cave.

680
00:58:55,739 --> 00:58:58,724
You didn't know me
and your first instinct was to save me.

681
00:58:58,850 --> 00:59:02,297
I'm begging you. Please, save my son.

682
00:59:06,051 --> 00:59:07,310
Check the whole place clean.

683
00:59:07,436 --> 00:59:09,059
Cover all access points.

684
00:59:09,430 --> 00:59:11,190
Keep looking.

685
00:59:19,781 --> 00:59:21,677
Area's clear.

686
00:59:21,803 --> 00:59:23,455
There. Take him.

687
00:59:23,581 --> 00:59:24,892
Right there, right there.

688
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:27,592
Shit...

689
00:59:27,718 --> 00:59:29,000
Move, move.

690
00:59:29,126 --> 00:59:30,598
Don't shoot him, I need him.

691
00:59:49,170 --> 00:59:50,813
End of the road, kid.

692
00:59:58,435 --> 00:59:59,730
Release the child.

693
00:59:59,856 --> 01:00:01,476
Whatever you say.

694
01:00:04,467 --> 01:00:05,687
Yes.

695
01:00:05,813 --> 01:00:06,442
Thank you.

696
01:00:06,568 --> 01:00:09,288
But maybe be more careful
with your word choice next time.

697
01:00:12,353 --> 01:00:15,113
Оh. And remember your catchphrase.

698
01:00:19,362 --> 01:00:21,382
Time to go, Amon.

699
01:00:28,415 --> 01:00:30,013
- Where's the crown?
- What crown?

700
01:00:30,140 --> 01:00:32,541
- You want to be brave, eh?
- I want you to go to hell.

701
01:00:32,667 --> 01:00:36,151
That's the plan, little man.
We'er gonna go for a ride. Come one.

702
01:00:50,567 --> 01:00:52,628
Put me down. Put me down.

703
01:00:52,754 --> 01:00:55,354
You should really be more careful
with your word choice next time.

704
01:00:55,417 --> 01:00:57,465
And tell them that the Man in Black...

705
01:01:02,976 --> 01:01:05,534
He's right behind me.
Where the hell is everybody?

706
01:01:15,964 --> 01:01:16,971
Mom?

707
01:01:17,097 --> 01:01:18,335
Amon, where are you?

708
01:01:18,461 --> 01:01:20,140
No, no, no, what?

709
01:01:20,266 --> 01:01:21,567
I'm on one of their bikes.

710
01:01:21,693 --> 01:01:23,080
What bikes?

711
01:01:42,293 --> 01:01:43,293
Amon.

712
01:01:43,416 --> 01:01:44,416
Can you hear me?

713
01:01:44,466 --> 01:01:45,718
Mom, I'm okay.

714
01:01:52,339 --> 01:01:53,766
Shit.

715
01:01:59,832 --> 01:02:01,129
Activate infrared.

716
01:02:06,956 --> 01:02:08,268
What are you doing?

717
01:02:08,394 --> 01:02:09,681
Searching for the child.

718
01:02:09,807 --> 01:02:11,110
No, you're murdering people.

719
01:02:11,237 --> 01:02:12,487
How else do I find the child?

720
01:02:12,613 --> 01:02:15,069
I can help you,
but no more extrajudicial killings.

721
01:02:15,196 --> 01:02:16,555
I don't need any help.

722
01:02:19,118 --> 01:02:21,896
Smasher, Cyclone.
What are you waiting for?

723
01:02:22,022 --> 01:02:23,679
- Come on, let's go.
- Okay.

724
01:02:23,805 --> 01:02:26,298
Okay. I got this. On the count of three.

725
01:02:26,424 --> 01:02:29,988
One, two...
This feels a lot higher than last time.

726
01:02:32,298 --> 01:02:33,838
That was not cool.

727
01:02:42,961 --> 01:02:45,886
Whoa, slow down.

728
01:02:50,353 --> 01:02:51,692
I got you. I got you.

729
01:03:02,437 --> 01:03:03,787
ENGINE FAILURE

730
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:13,913
Hey, careful, dude. I almost hit you.

731
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,148
I am so sorry.

732
01:03:20,274 --> 01:03:22,439
I don't really have peripheral vision
in the mask. It's my uncle's.

733
01:03:22,463 --> 01:03:23,882
I'll get it tailored.

734
01:03:24,008 --> 01:03:25,278
Me and you.

735
01:03:25,404 --> 01:03:26,622
Roger that.

736
01:04:11,278 --> 01:04:13,465
- Who are you?
- Call me Dr. Fate.

737
01:04:13,591 --> 01:04:16,356
How bad is it, Doc? Am I dying?

738
01:04:16,702 --> 01:04:18,656
I'm not that kind of doctor.

739
01:04:18,782 --> 01:04:20,540
But don't worry, I can see the future.

740
01:04:20,666 --> 01:04:22,499
This isn't how you're going to die.

741
01:04:22,625 --> 01:04:23,885
How do I die, then?

742
01:04:24,011 --> 01:04:25,644
Just stay away from electricity.

743
01:04:25,770 --> 01:04:28,620
Wait, what? I'm an electrician.

744
01:04:28,746 --> 01:04:30,927
How the hell am I supposed to do that?

745
01:04:41,572 --> 01:04:43,173
OVER SPEED
ETERNIUM LEVELS CRITICAL

746
01:05:37,937 --> 01:05:39,505
Oh, God.

747
01:05:40,379 --> 01:05:42,513
The Champion's coming for you.
You know that, right?

748
01:05:42,639 --> 01:05:44,258
I'm counting on it.

749
01:05:55,054 --> 01:05:56,584
Please don't.

750
01:05:57,058 --> 01:05:58,802
Teth Adam. Where are you?

751
01:05:58,928 --> 01:05:59,801
You followed me?

752
01:05:59,927 --> 01:06:03,752
My mind and body can exist
in different places at the same time.

753
01:06:03,878 --> 01:06:04,878
Did you find the boy?

754
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,087
Caught one of the bikes,
but he didn't have the child.

755
01:06:07,111 --> 01:06:09,276
Bring me the prisoner.
I'll break his mind.

756
01:06:12,338 --> 01:06:14,156
You killed him, didn't you?

757
01:06:21,057 --> 01:06:22,783
He didn't make it.

758
01:06:25,070 --> 01:06:28,263
The bullet's extracted.
The tissue damage has been repaired.

759
01:06:28,389 --> 01:06:32,326
Blood pressure, 120 over 81.
Heart rate's at 74 bpm.

760
01:06:32,911 --> 01:06:35,067
He'll be back on his feet in no time.

761
01:06:36,574 --> 01:06:38,469
That is insane.

762
01:06:39,027 --> 01:06:41,025
The nanobots did most of the work.

763
01:06:41,152 --> 01:06:43,254
No, no, no.
I'm not gonna let you downplay this.

764
01:06:43,380 --> 01:06:46,035
I literally just witnessed a miracle.

765
01:06:46,711 --> 01:06:48,221
What? I say something stupid?

766
01:06:48,347 --> 01:06:51,417
No, it's just that you can transform
your molecular structure,

767
01:06:51,543 --> 01:06:53,292
grow a hundred times your own size.

768
01:06:53,418 --> 01:06:56,091
You're an impossibility
and the world still amazes you.

769
01:06:56,218 --> 01:06:59,433
I don't know, it's... It's cool.

770
01:07:00,428 --> 01:07:01,848
Thank you.

771
01:07:02,451 --> 01:07:04,547
But it's not as cool as nanobots.

772
01:07:06,025 --> 01:07:08,093
That's how you do your wind thing.

773
01:07:08,289 --> 01:07:10,875
Well, the wind thing
is called aerokinesis.

774
01:07:11,001 --> 01:07:13,093
And the nanobots were injected
into my bloodstream...

775
01:07:13,220 --> 01:07:16,726
by this really messed-up scientist
who kidnapped me when I was 15.

776
01:07:20,059 --> 01:07:22,247
I'm... so sorry.

777
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:24,223
No, you're good.

778
01:07:24,349 --> 01:07:26,267
It seems like you really turned it around.

779
01:07:26,393 --> 01:07:27,936
Found your calling.

780
01:07:28,779 --> 01:07:30,542
Hoping this is mine.

781
01:07:36,163 --> 01:07:39,125
There's no point in dwelling in the past.

782
01:07:40,917 --> 01:07:43,574
It's already moved on from you.

783
01:07:47,008 --> 01:07:48,456
Why did you say that?

784
01:07:48,582 --> 01:07:51,107
You were blaming yourself
for trusting Ishmael.

785
01:07:51,234 --> 01:07:54,288
Your thoughts are beter spent
on the things you can change,

786
01:07:54,414 --> 01:07:56,242
not those you can't.

787
01:07:56,762 --> 01:07:58,577
You see the future?

788
01:07:58,703 --> 01:08:01,225
Tell me how I get my son back.

789
01:08:01,897 --> 01:08:03,362
By trusting us.

790
01:08:03,488 --> 01:08:06,489
Karim will live. We will save Amon.

791
01:08:06,615 --> 01:08:08,306
It's what we do.

792
01:08:13,023 --> 01:08:15,325
I suppose they didn't have doors
in your day.

793
01:08:15,451 --> 01:08:17,883
Well, of course we did.
That's how we entered rooms.

794
01:08:18,606 --> 01:08:20,832
What I did there is called sarcasm.

795
01:08:20,958 --> 01:08:23,234
Where's Amon? Did you found him?

796
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:26,427
Not yet, but I will.
The men who took him will suffer.

797
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:29,453
Maybe these guys can help.

798
01:08:30,589 --> 01:08:34,925
There's an upside to keeping prisoners.
They can answer our questions.

799
01:08:35,051 --> 01:08:37,378
What did you do with my son?

800
01:08:45,059 --> 01:08:47,436
Adrianna. Adrianna.

801
01:08:47,562 --> 01:08:50,807
I've learned that in this modern world,
we shouldn't hurt our prisoners.

802
01:08:50,933 --> 01:08:52,662
We should treat them
with dignity, respect.

803
01:08:53,708 --> 01:08:55,355
No.

804
01:08:55,990 --> 01:08:59,705
Let's start with just one simple question.
Can either of you fly?

805
01:09:01,654 --> 01:09:03,428
Shit.

806
01:09:04,366 --> 01:09:06,385
I think I'll sit this one out.

807
01:09:12,892 --> 01:09:14,604
Tell me what you did with Amon.

808
01:09:15,950 --> 01:09:18,007
You'd better not drop those prisoners.

809
01:09:18,134 --> 01:09:20,208
I'm not going to drop them.

810
01:09:21,396 --> 01:09:22,933
I'm going to drop one of them.

811
01:09:23,059 --> 01:09:25,508
Whoever ansers first lives. Where is he?

812
01:09:25,634 --> 01:09:26,875
I don't know.

813
01:09:33,473 --> 01:09:35,267
He's at our mine in the desert.

814
01:09:35,393 --> 01:09:36,956
I can show...

815
01:09:42,305 --> 01:09:44,703
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

816
01:09:46,168 --> 01:09:48,063
You said you wouldn't hurt the prisoners.

817
01:09:48,190 --> 01:09:49,877
That was sarcasm.

818
01:09:50,003 --> 01:09:51,686
No, technically, it was just a lie.

819
01:09:52,228 --> 01:09:53,748
Intergang have a mine in the desert.

820
01:09:53,874 --> 01:09:55,125
- Amon is there.
- I know it.

821
01:09:55,251 --> 01:09:57,343
It's near the Al Hadidiyah Mountains.

822
01:09:57,469 --> 01:09:58,963
Let's go.

823
01:09:59,933 --> 01:10:02,078
I told you, stop killing people.

824
01:10:02,205 --> 01:10:03,469
They look alive to me.

825
01:10:03,595 --> 01:10:05,188
Because I saved them.

826
01:10:05,314 --> 01:10:07,031
Well, that's why I waited
until you were there.

827
01:10:07,055 --> 01:10:09,872
I got the information I needed,
no one died.

828
01:10:09,998 --> 01:10:11,192
I did it your way.

829
01:10:11,318 --> 01:10:13,042
He does have a point.

830
01:10:13,836 --> 01:10:15,893
I know it got lost in all the confusing,

831
01:10:16,019 --> 01:10:18,167
but we still have some issues
to settle here.

832
01:10:18,293 --> 01:10:20,323
We know where Amon is. We have to go.

833
01:10:20,423 --> 01:10:21,980
There's no "we" here.

834
01:10:22,107 --> 01:10:26,041
There are only heroes
and there are villains.

835
01:10:26,168 --> 01:10:29,606
You think yourself a hero,
but you would let these criminals go free,

836
01:10:29,732 --> 01:10:32,840
knowing that many more will suffer
at their hands unless we end them now.

837
01:10:32,966 --> 01:10:35,590
Heroes don't kill people.

838
01:10:39,109 --> 01:10:40,390
Well, I do.

839
01:10:41,983 --> 01:10:43,349
Here we go.

840
01:11:44,396 --> 01:11:46,039
Is that what I think it is?

841
01:11:47,531 --> 01:11:49,402
23 pounds of pure Ethernium,

842
01:11:49,528 --> 01:11:52,056
much denser than typical artifacts
of the period.

843
01:11:52,183 --> 01:11:53,783
King must have had a really strong neck.

844
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:56,281
No, it snapped when I killed him.

845
01:11:57,601 --> 01:11:58,948
What's that?

846
01:11:59,074 --> 01:12:00,888
There's writing on the inside of the rim.

847
01:12:01,014 --> 01:12:03,722
"Life is the only path to death."

848
01:12:03,848 --> 01:12:05,166
That's what it says.

849
01:12:05,292 --> 01:12:08,305
Life is the only path to death.

850
01:12:08,431 --> 01:12:13,286
Well, that's surprisingly obvious.
Could it have another meaning?

851
01:12:13,412 --> 01:12:15,371
What if it means, like...

852
01:12:15,497 --> 01:12:18,980
"Life is short.
You gotta hold on to what you love."

853
01:12:21,002 --> 01:12:22,244
Stop.

854
01:12:22,370 --> 01:12:23,590
Deep.

855
01:12:23,716 --> 01:12:25,229
It doesn't matter what it means.

856
01:12:25,355 --> 01:12:27,358
It should be buried under the ocean
for eternity.

857
01:12:27,484 --> 01:12:30,491
That's not far from what we had in mind
for you when this is over.

858
01:12:30,617 --> 01:12:32,141
Or I could bury you with it.

859
01:12:33,811 --> 01:12:37,350
We can't get rid of it now.
It's the one thing that Intergang wants.

860
01:12:37,476 --> 01:12:41,334
Believe me, I know more than anyone
what this crown is capable of.

861
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:44,341
But we have to keep it
until my son is safe.

862
01:12:44,659 --> 01:12:48,107
Adrianna...
Trust me, we will get your son back.

863
01:12:48,233 --> 01:12:50,393
They don't care about him.
They just want to defeat me.

864
01:12:50,630 --> 01:12:52,083
Hand it over.

865
01:12:53,979 --> 01:12:57,763
We can't risk letting this crown fall
into the wrong hands.

866
01:12:58,524 --> 01:13:00,907
We will find another way.

867
01:13:01,578 --> 01:13:03,202
No.

868
01:13:03,404 --> 01:13:06,299
You like to split the world
into good and bad,

869
01:13:06,425 --> 01:13:09,593
but that's easy to do
when you're the one drawing the line.

870
01:13:09,719 --> 01:13:11,678
All I care about is Amon.

871
01:13:11,804 --> 01:13:15,800
And until he is safe,
we're all on the same side.

872
01:13:15,926 --> 01:13:20,042
And you... you will work together.

873
01:13:26,295 --> 01:13:28,803
Set a course
for the Al Hadidiyah Mountains.

874
01:13:29,126 --> 01:13:31,373
We'll go in at dawn.

875
01:13:32,161 --> 01:13:34,057
I hope you can be a team player.

876
01:13:34,184 --> 01:13:35,724
I love teams.

877
01:13:36,013 --> 01:13:37,816
That was sarcasm again, yes?

878
01:13:37,942 --> 01:13:39,056
Very much so.

879
01:13:39,183 --> 01:13:41,386
Good. Just checking.

880
01:13:51,666 --> 01:13:55,635
A wise man once told me
a bad plan is better than no plan at all.

881
01:13:55,761 --> 01:13:58,952
That was before we had a very bad plan.

882
01:13:59,078 --> 01:14:00,709
Let it go.

883
01:14:00,999 --> 01:14:03,682
I'd rather be fighting with him
than against him.

884
01:14:03,808 --> 01:14:05,442
He's a murderer, Kent.

885
01:14:05,568 --> 01:14:08,674
If he turns on us,
that kid is as good as dead.

886
01:14:08,930 --> 01:14:12,098
You don't get to decide who lives or dies.

887
01:14:13,104 --> 01:14:15,265
That's... up to Fate.

888
01:14:15,391 --> 01:14:17,709
What's the helmet telling you?

889
01:14:17,835 --> 01:14:19,998
Somebody's gonna die.

890
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:23,240
Who is it, Atom Smasher?
It's Atom Smasher.

891
01:14:23,366 --> 01:14:25,274
Surprisingly, no.

892
01:14:25,718 --> 01:14:27,370
Is it me?

893
01:14:32,936 --> 01:14:37,078
When it's time for you and I
to say goodbye, you'll know.

894
01:14:39,258 --> 01:14:41,428
All I can tell you is...

895
01:14:42,884 --> 01:14:46,052
There is still time to change the future.

896
01:14:46,570 --> 01:14:48,317
Let's use it.

897
01:14:53,215 --> 01:14:57,141
Well, I guess we're sticking
with a very bad plan.

898
01:15:05,576 --> 01:15:08,534
AL HADIDIYAH MINE
INTERGANG CONTROLLED OPERATION

899
01:15:08,660 --> 01:15:12,661
The Al Hadidiyah mine
is Intergang's most valued asset.

900
01:15:13,420 --> 01:15:17,151
I'm gonna land us right here,
cut off their access to reinforcements.

901
01:15:17,277 --> 01:15:20,209
But the perimeter of the mine
creates a natural fortress.

902
01:15:20,335 --> 01:15:22,467
There is only one way in, one way out.

903
01:15:22,593 --> 01:15:24,826
We'll be an easy target
for their fly bike patrol.

904
01:15:24,952 --> 01:15:28,867
Communication is key.
We keep in step or we get outflanked.

905
01:15:28,957 --> 01:15:32,254
We move through the mine, inch by inch,
until we find Amon.

906
01:15:32,380 --> 01:15:35,035
This is where you come in.
Are you ready... Damn it.

907
01:15:52,128 --> 01:15:53,511
Or we could just do that.

908
01:16:07,476 --> 01:16:12,227
Pure Eternium Shield.
Unbreakable, even with your powers.

909
01:16:19,559 --> 01:16:20,793
Amon.

910
01:16:20,919 --> 01:16:22,971
You hurt him, I will kill all of you.

911
01:16:23,098 --> 01:16:25,886
Nobody has to die. We just want the crown.

912
01:16:26,012 --> 01:16:27,673
We don't have it.

913
01:16:27,799 --> 01:16:32,234
Believe me,
nothing good will come from that crown.

914
01:16:33,392 --> 01:16:36,952
No crown, no negotiation.

915
01:16:37,662 --> 01:16:39,268
I have it.

916
01:16:40,694 --> 01:16:42,458
It's right here.

917
01:16:43,001 --> 01:16:46,354
Release my son, you can have it.

918
01:16:48,547 --> 01:16:50,514
What do you think you're doing?

919
01:16:51,521 --> 01:16:56,776
Intergang killed my husband.
I'm not letting them take my son, too.

920
01:17:01,769 --> 01:17:04,314
Not your son. Not your country.

921
01:17:05,819 --> 01:17:07,151
Not your decision to make.

922
01:17:08,230 --> 01:17:09,497
Stop there.

923
01:17:09,623 --> 01:17:12,860
It's okay. Nothing is gonna happen to you.

924
01:17:12,986 --> 01:17:14,279
Hand it over, now.

925
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:17,666
- I'm sorry, Mama.
- No.

926
01:17:23,524 --> 01:17:24,907
Now, let Amon go.

927
01:17:31,223 --> 01:17:31,850
I thank you.

928
01:17:31,976 --> 01:17:35,209
And I thanks your friends for returning
this crown to its rightful owner.

929
01:17:37,033 --> 01:17:40,644
What kind of Champion of Kahndaq
sides with foreign invaders?

930
01:17:40,770 --> 01:17:42,008
You have what you want.

931
01:17:43,248 --> 01:17:44,106
Let him go.

932
01:17:44,232 --> 01:17:45,852
Ishmael, what are you doing?

933
01:17:45,978 --> 01:17:47,578
Taking back what's mine.

934
01:17:48,472 --> 01:17:51,608
I'm the last living descendant
of King Ahk-Ton the Great.

935
01:17:51,734 --> 01:17:55,496
And you have just given me
everything I need to become the next...

936
01:17:55,622 --> 01:17:57,903
king of Kahndaq.

937
01:17:59,314 --> 01:18:02,826
My family passed the knowledge on,
you know, one to the next.

938
01:18:02,952 --> 01:18:09,354
This crown, crafted by our ancestors,
stolen by the wizards and hidden away.

939
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:13,885
But still a source of great power,
if only we can wield it.

940
01:18:18,794 --> 01:18:23,573
They say when Hurut died,
you wept like a baby.

941
01:18:24,752 --> 01:18:26,516
I wonder if you'll do the same for them.

942
01:18:26,642 --> 01:18:27,710
Please, Ishmael.

943
01:18:27,836 --> 01:18:28,900
Sorry, Amon.

944
01:18:31,262 --> 01:18:32,850
Fate, get ready.

945
01:18:32,976 --> 01:18:37,189
Death is the only path to life.

946
01:18:41,105 --> 01:18:43,252
Amon.

947
01:19:48,356 --> 01:19:49,676
Amon.

948
01:19:52,650 --> 01:19:56,261
He's alive.
But we need to get him to the medical bay.

949
01:19:56,387 --> 01:19:58,278
- Where is he shot?
- It wasn't a bullet.

950
01:19:58,404 --> 01:19:59,950
It was me.

951
01:20:08,572 --> 01:20:09,931
Come.

952
01:20:19,134 --> 01:20:20,772
We're going with you.

953
01:20:20,898 --> 01:20:23,543
Just find the crown.
Get it on the cruiser.

954
01:20:36,192 --> 01:20:39,867
I found the crown. But it's not alone.

955
01:20:50,562 --> 01:20:53,217
How long we gonna keep doing this?

956
01:20:55,945 --> 01:21:00,548
There's no point in fighting.
We both know no one can stop me.

957
01:21:01,055 --> 01:21:02,506
You're right.

958
01:21:03,349 --> 01:21:05,110
Only you can.

959
01:21:05,809 --> 01:21:09,308
Ishmael said you cried when Hurut died.

960
01:21:13,327 --> 01:21:14,791
Who's Hurut?

961
01:21:19,988 --> 01:21:22,216
Hurut was a true Champion of Kahndaq.

962
01:21:27,963 --> 01:21:30,457
And he was also... my son.

963
01:21:32,450 --> 01:21:34,996
I won't always be here to protect you.

964
01:21:35,272 --> 01:21:36,716
I don't need protection.

965
01:21:36,842 --> 01:21:38,328
I want to be free.

966
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:41,295
Freedom is for the birds.

967
01:21:41,421 --> 01:21:43,443
Let someone else be the hero...

968
01:21:44,164 --> 01:21:46,749
the graveyards are full of them.

969
01:21:51,691 --> 01:21:53,560
I tried to protect him.

970
01:22:01,417 --> 01:22:03,437
But I wasn't strong enough.

971
01:22:07,895 --> 01:22:09,233
Shazam.

972
01:22:10,955 --> 01:22:14,478
The wizards decided
that he would be their champion.

973
01:22:14,609 --> 01:22:17,121
But after the Champion's many victories,

974
01:22:17,247 --> 01:22:20,430
the king went after
what Hurut loved the most.

975
01:22:22,114 --> 01:22:23,704
Our family.

976
01:22:41,038 --> 01:22:43,033
Hold on, Father.

977
01:22:43,743 --> 01:22:45,257
Stay with me.

978
01:22:52,338 --> 01:22:54,238
With my powers...

979
01:22:54,547 --> 01:22:56,397
you'll be safe.

980
01:22:57,003 --> 01:22:59,240
I couldn't protect your mother.

981
01:22:59,964 --> 01:23:02,599
Repeat what I say.

982
01:23:03,327 --> 01:23:04,768
- Shazam.
- Shazam.

983
01:23:17,818 --> 01:23:20,280
Instead of battling the king...

984
01:23:20,727 --> 01:23:23,264
Instead of saving Kahndaq...

985
01:23:24,059 --> 01:23:26,507
Hurut chose to save...

986
01:23:27,173 --> 01:23:28,722
me.

987
01:23:45,184 --> 01:23:49,866
But he couldn't save himself
from the king's assassins.

988
01:23:52,296 --> 01:23:55,284
The powers were not a gift
from the wizards...

989
01:23:56,045 --> 01:23:57,493
but a curse.

990
01:24:07,150 --> 01:24:09,959
Born out of rage.

991
01:24:12,636 --> 01:24:14,885
The statue of the Champion isn't you.

992
01:24:18,025 --> 01:24:19,314
It's Hurut.

993
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:24,843
My son dreamt of a better world.

994
01:24:25,581 --> 01:24:27,671
That's why he saved me.

995
01:24:31,773 --> 01:24:34,813
But the world was only a better place
with him in it.

996
01:24:50,193 --> 01:24:51,864
Kahndaq needed a hero.

997
01:24:53,633 --> 01:24:55,256
Instead, it got me.

998
01:24:57,960 --> 01:24:59,591
All this power...

999
01:25:00,822 --> 01:25:03,714
And the only thing I can do with it
is hurt people.

1000
01:25:04,402 --> 01:25:09,118
I will speak the word my son gave me,
and I will give up my power.

1001
01:25:11,260 --> 01:25:15,077
And when I do,
you must ensure I never speak it again.

1002
01:25:20,932 --> 01:25:22,260
Shazam.

1003
01:25:29,856 --> 01:25:32,717
Some men are not meant...

1004
01:25:32,843 --> 01:25:34,429
to be heroes.

1005
01:25:40,106 --> 01:25:44,944
TASK FORCE X BLACK SITE
SECRET LOCATION

1006
01:26:18,702 --> 01:26:20,203
Hey.

1007
01:26:37,976 --> 01:26:40,909
So beautiful.

1008
01:27:06,408 --> 01:27:08,164
Surprised to see us?

1009
01:27:08,290 --> 01:27:11,189
Surprise is a dirty word in this business.

1010
01:27:11,315 --> 01:27:13,748
Are you sure you can handle him?

1011
01:27:14,230 --> 01:27:17,305
You're the one who can see the future,
you'll tell me if we can't.

1012
01:27:17,431 --> 01:27:18,852
Just be careful with this one.

1013
01:27:19,674 --> 01:27:22,264
You know, they say the gods created us,

1014
01:27:22,390 --> 01:27:25,518
but we're the ones
who always wind up burying them.

1015
01:27:26,555 --> 01:27:28,611
Waller sends her regards.

1016
01:27:35,015 --> 01:27:36,864
They'll know how to deal with him.

1017
01:27:36,990 --> 01:27:42,286
To keep him from regaining his powers,
they'll keep him in suspended animation.

1018
01:27:49,404 --> 01:27:53,636
As long as he's submerged,
he won't be able to speak.

1019
01:27:57,548 --> 01:28:00,171
He'll never say another word again.

1020
01:28:18,735 --> 01:28:21,156
Hey. There he is.

1021
01:28:21,282 --> 01:28:25,171
Not all heroes wear capes,
but I think you earned this.

1022
01:28:25,297 --> 01:28:27,623
Well, statistically,
most heroes don't wear capes.

1023
01:28:27,749 --> 01:28:29,642
But yeah, try it on.

1024
01:28:32,571 --> 01:28:34,454
Yeah, looks pretty good.

1025
01:28:37,554 --> 01:28:39,452
That's a nice touch.

1026
01:29:19,300 --> 01:29:20,793
Kent.

1027
01:29:21,878 --> 01:29:23,491
Kent.

1028
01:29:26,382 --> 01:29:27,867
Mission accomplished?

1029
01:29:27,993 --> 01:29:29,587
My vision hasn't changed.

1030
01:29:29,992 --> 01:29:32,155
But Teth Adam's out of the equation.

1031
01:29:32,281 --> 01:29:35,253
Kent, if this isn't over,
I need to know what's coming.

1032
01:29:35,379 --> 01:29:37,488
What is the helmet telling you?

1033
01:29:38,305 --> 01:29:41,538
My vision has always shown me
great calamity.

1034
01:29:41,664 --> 01:29:43,718
The world in flames.

1035
01:29:43,844 --> 01:29:45,387
We can stop it...

1036
01:29:46,922 --> 01:29:48,862
but you die.

1037
01:29:50,419 --> 01:29:52,525
You should've told me sooner.

1038
01:29:55,129 --> 01:29:56,969
I have no fear of death.

1039
01:29:57,096 --> 01:29:59,260
That's precisely why I didn't tell you.

1040
01:29:59,386 --> 01:30:01,599
The world needs the Justice Society.

1041
01:30:01,725 --> 01:30:03,313
The world needs you.

1042
01:30:03,439 --> 01:30:06,178
But you can't choose who lives and dies.

1043
01:30:06,304 --> 01:30:08,191
That's Fate, right?

1044
01:30:08,894 --> 01:30:12,775
Well, that sounds familiar.

1045
01:30:15,032 --> 01:30:17,989
I remember seeing my first airplane.

1046
01:30:18,783 --> 01:30:23,174
It was an RAF deployment,
headed to the Western Front.

1047
01:30:23,847 --> 01:30:26,888
Everyone on my street
came out to see them off.

1048
01:30:28,329 --> 01:30:30,428
But I didn't cheer.

1049
01:30:31,524 --> 01:30:33,784
Even though I was only a boy.

1050
01:30:34,315 --> 01:30:38,665
I knew where they were headed,
and what awaited them.

1051
01:30:38,791 --> 01:30:42,540
Thanks to this, I've lived longer
than I could've ever have hoped for.

1052
01:30:42,666 --> 01:30:47,163
I have seen the world change
in more ways than I could've imagined.

1053
01:30:49,854 --> 01:30:51,705
I'm still a sentimental fool.

1054
01:30:53,256 --> 01:30:55,496
And I don't want my friend to die.

1055
01:31:02,964 --> 01:31:07,573
Ishmael said,
"Death is the only path to life."

1056
01:31:07,699 --> 01:31:10,372
But that's not what the inscription says.

1057
01:31:10,498 --> 01:31:13,421
Right. "Life is the only way to death."

1058
01:31:13,872 --> 01:31:17,601
Maybe he got it backwards,
like he read it in a mirror or something.

1059
01:31:17,727 --> 01:31:20,114
That's it. In Kahndaqi mythology,

1060
01:31:20,240 --> 01:31:23,352
the souls of the damned
are sent to the Rock of Finality.

1061
01:31:23,478 --> 01:31:28,394
The underworld is a mirror to our own.
Here, turn the crown around.

1062
01:31:28,930 --> 01:31:30,357
Now mirror the letters.

1063
01:31:30,483 --> 01:31:32,789
See? That's what I missed.

1064
01:31:33,914 --> 01:31:37,925
"Death is the only path to life."

1065
01:31:41,472 --> 01:31:44,148
He kidnapped Amon on purpose,

1066
01:31:44,274 --> 01:31:46,629
because he knew
that Teth Adam would kill him.

1067
01:31:46,755 --> 01:31:50,613
And he believed the Champion's magic
would send him to the Rock of Finality.

1068
01:31:50,739 --> 01:31:54,336
As life is the path to death.

1069
01:31:54,462 --> 01:31:58,112
Now your death is a path to life.

1070
01:31:58,238 --> 01:32:02,504
The wizards have their champion,
now we have ours.

1071
01:32:02,630 --> 01:32:05,405
You will take the throne of Kahndaq...

1072
01:32:05,531 --> 01:32:09,194
and unleash hell on Earth.

1073
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:12,102
Speak our name.

1074
01:32:12,228 --> 01:32:14,084
"Sabbac."

1075
01:32:34,425 --> 01:32:36,847
What the bloody hell is that?

1076
01:32:36,973 --> 01:32:38,763
Readout says it's the demon, Sabbac.

1077
01:32:38,889 --> 01:32:40,696
Get me closer. Now, right now.

1078
01:32:40,822 --> 01:32:42,858
We're 100 miles out, give me 20 seconds.

1079
01:32:50,356 --> 01:32:53,280
The king has returned.

1080
01:32:53,510 --> 01:32:56,129
The throne will be mine.

1081
01:32:57,925 --> 01:32:59,944
Brace yourselves.

1082
01:33:05,434 --> 01:33:06,934
Hold on.

1083
01:33:43,320 --> 01:33:44,851
Now prepare to die.

1084
01:33:50,893 --> 01:33:52,372
Wait, wait, where's Uncle Karim?

1085
01:34:09,314 --> 01:34:12,311
No matter what happens,
he does not sit on that throne.

1086
01:34:15,513 --> 01:34:17,409
- Copy that.
- We're on it.

1087
01:34:17,535 --> 01:34:18,869
Heads up.

1088
01:35:03,131 --> 01:35:04,453
Activate infrared.

1089
01:35:07,928 --> 01:35:09,814
Sabbac, show yourself.

1090
01:35:12,336 --> 01:35:14,072
Adrianna.

1091
01:35:14,357 --> 01:35:16,085
Amon.

1092
01:35:19,137 --> 01:35:20,915
That's for my cruiser.

1093
01:35:59,183 --> 01:36:00,913
This is it.

1094
01:36:01,834 --> 01:36:03,487
We can't win, Carter.

1095
01:36:03,613 --> 01:36:06,738
Yeah, but the world burns if we don't.
Right?

1096
01:36:09,115 --> 01:36:11,303
Bad plan is better than no plan at all.

1097
01:36:38,065 --> 01:36:40,326
No, no, no. What are you doing?

1098
01:36:40,452 --> 01:36:42,097
Giving us a third option.

1099
01:36:42,223 --> 01:36:43,557
It's supposed to be me.

1100
01:36:43,683 --> 01:36:45,981
I didn't tell you my whole vision,
old friend.

1101
01:36:46,652 --> 01:36:48,255
I did see your death.

1102
01:36:48,381 --> 01:36:50,635
But I also found a way to prevent it.

1103
01:36:50,761 --> 01:36:55,365
It has been an extraordinary life,
but always with one foot in the future.

1104
01:36:55,491 --> 01:36:58,651
Carter, for the first time in 100 years,

1105
01:36:58,777 --> 01:37:00,591
when I look ahead...

1106
01:37:02,665 --> 01:37:03,856
I see nothing.

1107
01:37:03,982 --> 01:37:04,982
No, Kent.

1108
01:37:05,064 --> 01:37:06,467
And...

1109
01:37:06,770 --> 01:37:08,337
it's...

1110
01:37:08,805 --> 01:37:09,886
beautiful.

1111
01:37:10,013 --> 01:37:11,022
Wait, Kent.

1112
01:37:11,107 --> 01:37:12,107
Goodbye...

1113
01:37:12,200 --> 01:37:13,400
Kent.

1114
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:14,954
...my dear friend.

1115
01:37:15,081 --> 01:37:16,301
Kent.

1116
01:37:18,810 --> 01:37:20,829
Hit it from every side.

1117
01:37:22,835 --> 01:37:24,854
Kent.

1118
01:37:26,980 --> 01:37:28,998
No.

1119
01:37:47,872 --> 01:37:52,666
I am Dr. Fate, sorcerer,
agent of the Lords of Order,

1120
01:37:52,792 --> 01:37:55,989
defender against darkness and chaos,

1121
01:37:56,116 --> 01:37:59,736
but even my powers cannot defeat you.

1122
01:38:08,900 --> 01:38:11,410
There's no one that can defeat me.

1123
01:38:15,533 --> 01:38:19,968
There is one... There is one...

1124
01:38:20,095 --> 01:38:21,725
Teth Adam.

1125
01:38:22,589 --> 01:38:24,716
I know you can hear me.

1126
01:38:26,226 --> 01:38:30,194
The battle your son
was meant to fight is upon us.

1127
01:38:30,320 --> 01:38:35,323
Now you are the only one
who can defeat the Demon Champion.

1128
01:39:00,977 --> 01:39:04,921
You have the power
to be the destroyer of this world.

1129
01:39:07,479 --> 01:39:10,432
But you can also be its savior.

1130
01:39:27,272 --> 01:39:32,746
You believe you are not a worthy champion
because the wizards did not choose you.

1131
01:39:32,872 --> 01:39:36,626
But Fate does not make mistakes.
Neither did your son.

1132
01:39:40,686 --> 01:39:42,366
We were wrong about you.

1133
01:39:42,492 --> 01:39:45,589
The world doesn't always need
a white knight.

1134
01:39:45,830 --> 01:39:48,022
Sometimes it needs something darker.

1135
01:40:03,901 --> 01:40:08,249
Don't you dare give up on us now.
The world needs you.

1136
01:41:15,168 --> 01:41:16,758
Kent.

1137
01:41:25,867 --> 01:41:27,098
No.

1138
01:42:31,283 --> 01:42:32,621
Mom?

1139
01:42:33,226 --> 01:42:34,975
What's happening?

1140
01:42:36,101 --> 01:42:37,893
It's Sabbac.

1141
01:42:38,245 --> 01:42:39,880
He commands the Legions of Hell.

1142
01:42:40,224 --> 01:42:41,919
Whatever happens...

1143
01:42:43,102 --> 01:42:44,683
you stay behind me.

1144
01:42:58,832 --> 01:43:01,556
Don't worry, I die by electricity.

1145
01:43:03,123 --> 01:43:05,828
You want some Kahndaq? Come and get it.

1146
01:43:05,954 --> 01:43:07,344
Come and get it.

1147
01:43:07,884 --> 01:43:08,884
No, no. No.

1148
01:43:09,007 --> 01:43:11,436
- Don't send me home, I can help.
- I know.

1149
01:43:11,562 --> 01:43:14,443
But you can do better
than swinging a stick.

1150
01:43:52,398 --> 01:43:55,510
The Gods have brought us together again.

1151
01:43:57,237 --> 01:44:00,163
It's not your time, Father.

1152
01:44:03,475 --> 01:44:04,931
Hey.

1153
01:44:05,350 --> 01:44:07,020
What are you all standing around for?

1154
01:44:08,249 --> 01:44:10,058
This is our chance.

1155
01:44:12,717 --> 01:44:15,789
With these hands, we built Kahndaq.

1156
01:44:16,067 --> 01:44:18,139
And with these hands, we will set it free.

1157
01:44:24,203 --> 01:44:26,112
The people need a hero.

1158
01:44:27,716 --> 01:44:29,445
No, Father.

1159
01:44:29,842 --> 01:44:32,171
They need to be free.

1160
01:44:36,053 --> 01:44:38,072
What are we waiting for?

1161
01:45:00,291 --> 01:45:02,723
Say the word.

1162
01:45:03,814 --> 01:45:05,115
Shazam.

1163
01:45:15,524 --> 01:45:18,644
The people of Kahndaq rise up against you.

1164
01:45:47,092 --> 01:45:48,709
Yes.

1165
01:45:52,869 --> 01:45:54,358
I got this.

1166
01:45:55,370 --> 01:45:56,913
Go get him.

1167
01:46:14,126 --> 01:46:15,928
You know what I have to do.

1168
01:46:17,452 --> 01:46:19,108
Beat his ass.

1169
01:46:19,234 --> 01:46:24,432
Let the fate of Kahndaq be decided
by a true battle of champions.

1170
01:46:24,950 --> 01:46:26,721
Let's end this.

1171
01:46:52,887 --> 01:46:54,141
It's a lot of them.

1172
01:46:55,758 --> 01:46:58,150
- It's a bit more than I thought.
- Yeah.

1173
01:46:58,276 --> 01:46:59,479
Just a bit.

1174
01:47:07,057 --> 01:47:08,899
Hey, mom.

1175
01:47:15,735 --> 01:47:19,402
These are our streets. Our city.

1176
01:47:20,873 --> 01:47:23,041
Free Kahndaq.

1177
01:47:30,676 --> 01:47:33,293
The wizards' powers were wasted on you.

1178
01:47:33,419 --> 01:47:35,811
You are not a hero.

1179
01:47:37,670 --> 01:47:40,961
No. I'm not.

1180
01:47:42,643 --> 01:47:44,114
But he is.

1181
01:47:55,318 --> 01:47:57,659
You cannot stand against me.

1182
01:47:57,785 --> 01:48:00,578
I am Kahndaq's true champion.

1183
01:48:09,893 --> 01:48:12,926
I learned this trick from an old friend.

1184
01:48:51,567 --> 01:48:53,196
You can control it.

1185
01:48:57,293 --> 01:48:58,812
You have to.

1186
01:49:09,791 --> 01:49:12,430
Tell them the Man in Black sent you.

1187
01:49:35,505 --> 01:49:38,873
- Yes.
- Yes.

1188
01:50:01,982 --> 01:50:04,709
I never tought I'd be happy to see you.

1189
01:50:07,651 --> 01:50:09,789
I'm only here because of him.

1190
01:50:12,628 --> 01:50:14,945
That makes two of us.

1191
01:50:31,479 --> 01:50:33,574
See you around, old friend.

1192
01:50:48,641 --> 01:50:50,373
Think you can keep him out of trouble?

1193
01:50:50,499 --> 01:50:52,149
As long as no one comes looking for it.

1194
01:50:52,275 --> 01:50:53,859
Fair enough.

1195
01:50:55,258 --> 01:50:56,862
Just be careful.

1196
01:50:56,989 --> 01:51:00,138
The kind of justice you dish out
can darken your soul.

1197
01:51:00,264 --> 01:51:05,719
It's his darkness that lets him do
what heroes like you cannot.

1198
01:51:07,211 --> 01:51:09,672
I guess we'll find out, won't we?

1199
01:51:17,459 --> 01:51:19,662
I tought we made
a pretty good team back there.

1200
01:51:19,788 --> 01:51:21,320
Just saying.

1201
01:51:22,604 --> 01:51:24,518
We made a great team.

1202
01:51:30,049 --> 01:51:31,557
- Maybe we could...
- Don't push it.

1203
01:51:32,153 --> 01:51:34,220
Smasher, let's go.

1204
01:51:45,336 --> 01:51:48,069
Long live the Champion.

1205
01:51:48,195 --> 01:51:53,884
Long live the Champion.
Long live the Champion.

1206
01:51:55,494 --> 01:51:57,392
You could lead them.

1207
01:52:30,708 --> 01:52:32,361
How does it feel?

1208
01:52:33,889 --> 01:52:35,152
Wrong.

1209
01:52:46,452 --> 01:52:47,898
So... what now?

1210
01:52:48,709 --> 01:52:51,129
Does this mean you're finally
gonna be our hero?

1211
01:52:51,255 --> 01:52:53,528
Kahndaq has always had heroes.

1212
01:52:54,023 --> 01:52:55,601
And it still does.

1213
01:52:56,447 --> 01:52:59,354
What is needs now is a protector.

1214
01:52:59,447 --> 01:53:00,948
Thank you, Teth Adam.

1215
01:53:01,074 --> 01:53:03,730
Perhaps that name is a little...

1216
01:53:03,855 --> 01:53:05,310
old-fashioned.

1217
01:53:06,297 --> 01:53:08,145
So what should we call you?

1218
01:55:45,851 --> 01:55:49,696
BLACK ADAM

1219
01:56:03,359 --> 01:56:05,967
Okay, "Black Adam."

1220
01:56:06,210 --> 01:56:11,163
My name is Amanda Waller.
Congratulations, you have my attention.

1221
01:56:11,289 --> 01:56:14,523
This is gonna be your only warning.

1222
01:56:15,221 --> 01:56:18,129
You don't want to stay in my prison,
that's fine.

1223
01:56:18,255 --> 01:56:20,562
Kahndaq is your prison now.

1224
01:56:20,854 --> 01:56:24,815
You step one foot ouside of it,
you will not live to regret it.

1225
01:56:26,800 --> 01:56:29,020
There's no one on this planet
that can stop me.

1226
01:56:29,146 --> 01:56:32,798
I can call in a favor and send people
who aren't from this planet.

1227
01:56:34,681 --> 01:56:36,637
Send them all.

1228
01:56:37,758 --> 01:56:39,171
As you wish.

1229
01:56:54,152 --> 01:56:58,336
It's been a while since anyone's
made the world this nervous.

1230
01:57:03,419 --> 01:57:05,107
Black Adam.

1231
01:57:06,153 --> 01:57:07,788
We should talk.
