00:00:01,433 --> 00:00:05,804
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:05,806 --> 00:00:07,473
When I was a child,
I saw my mother

4
00:00:07,475 --> 00:00:09,174
Killed by something impossible.

5
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:10,943
Run, Barry, run!

6
00:00:10,945 --> 00:00:12,945
My father went to prison
for her murder.

7
00:00:12,947 --> 00:00:16,849
Then an accident
made me the impossible.

8
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:19,585
To the outside world, I'm
an ordinary forensic scientist,

9
00:00:19,587 --> 00:00:21,653
But secretly I use my speed

10
00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:24,189
To fight crime
and find others like me,

11
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:26,859
And one day I'll find
who killed my mother...

12
00:00:26,861 --> 00:00:29,128
- Mom!
- And get justice for my father.

13
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,130
I am the Flash.

14
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,367
Previously on <i>the Flash...</i>

15
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:36,835
Iris West.

16
00:00:36,837 --> 00:00:38,637
I hear you've been
writing about me.

17
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:40,439
I've been
collecting internet posts

18
00:00:40,441 --> 00:00:42,641
About the Streak sightings.
Baby, there's no Streak.

19
00:00:42,643 --> 00:00:44,643
I saw him, Barry.
He wears a red suit.

20
00:00:44,645 --> 00:00:48,514
I finally diagnosed why Iris
is writing about the Streak.

21
00:00:48,516 --> 00:00:50,015
She's doing it for me.

22
00:00:50,017 --> 00:00:52,251
I'm gonna find out
who really killed Laura,

23
00:00:52,253 --> 00:00:54,420
And I'm going
to get you out of here.

24
00:00:54,422 --> 00:00:56,188
Whoever this Streak is,

25
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,324
I am not stopping until the rest
of the world believes in him.

26
00:00:59,326 --> 00:01:02,995
Maybe we shouldn't
see each other for a while.

27
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,069
To understand
what I'm about to tell you,

28
00:01:10,071 --> 00:01:12,071
You need to do something first.

29
00:01:12,073 --> 00:01:14,740
You need to believe
in the impossible.

30
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:16,008
Can you do that?

31
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,576
Good, because all of us,

32
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:19,945
We have forgotten
what miracles look like.

33
00:01:19,947 --> 00:01:22,881
Maybe because they haven't made
much of an appearance lately.

34
00:01:22,883 --> 00:01:25,350
Our lives have become ordinary,

35
00:01:25,352 --> 00:01:28,754
But there is someone out there
who is truly extraordinary.

36
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:30,556
I don't know
where you came from.

37
00:01:30,558 --> 00:01:31,857
I don't know your name,

38
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:33,859
But I have seen
you do the impossible

39
00:01:33,861 --> 00:01:35,861
To protect the city I love.

40
00:01:35,863 --> 00:01:39,164
So for those of us who believe
in you and what you're doing,

41
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:41,767
I just want to say thank you.

42
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:48,040
Hmm.

43
00:01:56,249 --> 00:02:00,219
You're welcome.

44
00:02:00,221 --> 00:02:01,587
How did you...

45
00:02:01,589 --> 00:02:05,124
I literally just hit send.
Speed reading.

46
00:02:05,126 --> 00:02:08,727
It's crazy
what you can do to your voice.

47
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,829
You need to stop
writing your blog.

48
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:12,564
People need to know
that you exist.

49
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:22,341
What else can you do?

50
00:02:22,343 --> 00:02:24,576
- This is not an interview.
- Come on.

51
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:26,245
You got to give me something.

52
00:02:26,247 --> 00:02:28,480
Hobbies, pet peeves,
favorite color?

53
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:29,648
Wait, scratch that last one.

54
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,583
Red, duh, obviously.

55
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:33,552
- You're not hearing me.
- My hearing is fine.

56
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:35,821
It's just selective.

57
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:39,758
What should I call you?

58
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,460
Anything but the Streak.

59
00:02:41,462 --> 00:02:44,463
Fine. Suggestions?

60
00:02:44,465 --> 00:02:46,798
You said you were writing
about me to bring hope

61
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,001
To someone you care about.

62
00:02:49,003 --> 00:02:53,839
How would he feel if doing
that put you in harm's way?

63
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:56,741
He and I aren't exactly
on the same page these days.

64
00:02:56,744 --> 00:02:59,004
Besides, you're giving hope
to a lot of people,

65
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:01,013
So I'm doing this for them.

66
00:03:05,653 --> 00:03:07,353
To be continued.

67
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:09,354
Gotta run.

68
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,700
Hey!
You can't just leave me up...

69
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:14,526
here.

70
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:18,130
Whoa.

71
00:03:18,132 --> 00:03:21,166
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

72
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:41,553
What kind of a tool
steals a yellow humvee?

73
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,488
What kind of tool
buys a yellow humvee?

74
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:46,158
Get these people back.
I need everybody back!

75
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,464
Son!
Out of the way!

76
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:55,334
Out of the way!

77
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:10,549
What the hell?

78
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:15,153
Eddie!
Eddie!

79
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:18,423
Yeah!

80
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:30,035
Step out of the vehicle!

81
00:04:30,037 --> 00:04:31,603
If you say so.

82
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:39,077
Uh-oh.

83
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:58,563
Unh!

84
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:07,839
Looks like you were born
to take a beating.

85
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:16,948
Check the math.

86
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,684
Your dispersal models
don't correlate.

87
00:05:18,686 --> 00:05:20,752
Uh, they do if you factor
in the seasonal fluctuations

88
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:21,953
In reproduction cycles.

89
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:23,422
What exactly are we debating?

90
00:05:23,424 --> 00:05:24,790
The average number of bugs

91
00:05:24,792 --> 00:05:26,491
Barry swallows
in a day of running.

92
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:29,661
I look forward to seeing
you accept your Nobel.

93
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,968
Barry?

94
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:41,306
Barry?
Are you okay?

95
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,043
13 fractures.

96
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:47,479
That's a new record,
and that's just in your hand.

97
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:50,048
You also have a concussion,
three cracked ribs,

98
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,150
And a bruised spleen.

99
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:55,854
Even with your powers,
you'll need a few hours to heal.

100
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:58,123
What exactly did you hit?

101
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,524
A man.

102
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:02,894
A big, bad man.

103
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:05,530
His skin changed when I hit him.

104
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:07,733
Like, it turned to metal.

105
00:06:07,735 --> 00:06:09,368
Interesting.

106
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,703
A man of steel.

107
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:13,905
So you went after
a meta-human alone?

108
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:15,440
Dude, why didn't you call us?

109
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:18,110
I didn't know what he was.

110
00:06:18,112 --> 00:06:21,179
Besides, I was off-duty.

111
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:23,615
Hmm.

112
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:25,517
You're lucky
he didn't knock out your teeth.

113
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:27,519
Those puppies
don't grow back.

114
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:31,056
The strange thing is
I feel like I knew him.

115
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:32,657
What do you mean?

116
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:36,928
He said something
that was familiar,

117
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,663
But he's gonna hurt someone
if we don't stop him.

118
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:40,599
So how do I fight a guy
that's made of steel?

119
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:42,067
We will find a way.

120
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:44,536
Tonight, you heal.

121
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:46,538
Yeah.

122
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:55,347
There was lightning
in my house.

123
00:06:55,349 --> 00:06:57,282
Yellow and red lightning.

124
00:06:57,284 --> 00:07:01,219
There was a man in yellow,
then I was on the street.

125
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:03,221
I don't know how I got there.

126
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:06,223
Please, you have to
believe me!

127
00:07:06,894 --> 00:07:08,660
Hey.

128
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:10,128
What happened to you
last night?

129
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,731
Got beat up
by a steel-plated sociopath.

130
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:15,733
Good times.

131
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:18,403
- So he is a meta-human?
- Yeah.

132
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:22,073
That particle accelerator's
the gift that keeps on giving.

133
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:23,341
You okay?

134
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:25,076
Relatively.

135
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:26,678
Any idea who he is?

136
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,114
Eddie's taking point
while I run down a lead.

137
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:30,615
I need you to work with him
until I get back.

138
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:31,950
Wait, why me?

139
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:34,319
Because he saw something
impossible

140
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:38,089
That he's got questions about,
questions that I can't answer.

141
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:40,425
In other words,
make up some science-y stuff

142
00:07:40,427 --> 00:07:42,761
To throw him off?

143
00:07:42,763 --> 00:07:44,596
Exactly.

144
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:49,801
He stole the humvee
and evaded capture.

145
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,637
So pleased you could join us,
Mr. Allen.

146
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,772
Rough night?

147
00:07:53,774 --> 00:07:56,274
Uh, just a little beat, sir.

148
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:58,009
As I was saying,

149
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:01,413
Our perp yanked three ATMs
after he boosted the vehicle.

150
00:08:01,415 --> 00:08:03,582
ATM security cameras
caught him on video.

151
00:08:03,584 --> 00:08:05,217
We got a hit in the database.

152
00:08:05,219 --> 00:08:07,118
Tony Woodward.

153
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,820
He's got a history
of violence, petty theft,

154
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:11,189
Assault, going way back
to juvie.

155
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:13,124
Dropped off the radar
ten months ago.

156
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:15,861
Looks like he's back.

157
00:08:15,863 --> 00:08:18,296
Increased pressure
produces increased heat,

158
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:20,532
And if you don't release it,
you get combustion.

159
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:22,901
I don't know how you
remember all this stuff, Barry.

160
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:25,804
Because he's a little freak,
just like his old man.

161
00:08:25,806 --> 00:08:27,572
Don't talk about my dad.

162
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:28,640
Or what?

163
00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:32,511
Is he gonna murder me, too?

164
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:36,348
Looks like you were born
to take a beating, Allen.

165
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,453
Allen.

166
00:08:41,455 --> 00:08:43,688
- Hey, Allen.
- Hey.

167
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:44,850
You okay?

168
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,491
Hey, yeah.
Sorry, Eddie.

169
00:08:46,493 --> 00:08:48,727
Listen,
I saw something last night

170
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:51,229
I just can't get my head around.

171
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:52,697
Uh-huh.

172
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,966
I fired a dozen rounds
at our car thief,

173
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:58,470
And it was
like they sparked off of him.

174
00:08:58,472 --> 00:09:00,472
Huh, well, I mean,

175
00:09:00,474 --> 00:09:04,476
He must have been
wearing some kind of body armor.

176
00:09:04,478 --> 00:09:06,077
On his face?

177
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:10,315
- Um...
- hey.

178
00:09:10,317 --> 00:09:12,050
Barry.

179
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,418
Hi, Babe, I saw the news.

180
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,353
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine,

181
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:17,255
Which you would know
if you checked your messages.

182
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:18,290
I tried you three times.

183
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:19,424
Sorry.

184
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:22,794
I had to work late.

185
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:25,030
Um, so I heard
that the Streak saved a kid.

186
00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:26,731
Any comment, Detective?

187
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:29,200
All I know is our perp
got away,

188
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:31,403
But Barry here is gonna
help me find him.

189
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:32,904
- Yeah.
- Fine.

190
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,639
I have other sources.

191
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:36,942
I will see you tonight.

192
00:09:36,944 --> 00:09:39,477
- Bye.
- Bye.

193
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,048
What is going on with you two?

194
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,749
What do you mean?

195
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,418
Nothing, it's fine.
It's... sorry, it's fine.

196
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:49,688
I don't know.

197
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,756
Okay.

198
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,967
Dr. Wells.

199
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:04,035
I guess you heard about
Barry's incident last night.

200
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:06,104
If you're looking for him
I think he's at the station.

201
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,073
I actually came here
to see you.

202
00:10:08,075 --> 00:10:11,476
I need your help
solving an old case of mine.

203
00:10:11,478 --> 00:10:12,944
What case is that?

204
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:16,281
The murder of Barry's mother.

205
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:27,025
Your childhood nemesis is now
an unstoppable meta-human.

206
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:29,094
That is seriously messed up.

207
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:31,062
I had a childhood nemesis.

208
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:32,897
Lexi la Roche.

209
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:34,232
She used to put gum
in my hair.

210
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:35,567
Jake Puckett.

211
00:10:35,569 --> 00:10:37,268
If I didn't let him
copy my homework

212
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,237
He'd give me a swirly.

213
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:41,272
Now that we've established
that we're all uber-nerds,

214
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:42,707
What are we gonna do
about Tony?

215
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:44,542
Glad you asked.

216
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:46,378
We're gonna train you, man.

217
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:49,247
<i>Karate kid</i> style.

218
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:51,983
Behold!

219
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:55,053
I call him girder.

220
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:57,522
For the record, not my idea.

221
00:10:57,524 --> 00:10:59,257
Fighting is physics.

222
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:01,092
It's not about strength.
It's not about size.

223
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:03,294
It's about energy and power.

224
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:04,929
Channel your speed the right way

225
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:07,165
And you can totally take
this bad boy down.

226
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:11,703
Now obviously your girder
is a moving target.

227
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:16,107
So...

228
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:22,113
I have ice
and bandages standing by.

229
00:11:36,797 --> 00:11:39,431
I'm pretty sure
I just dislocated my shoulder.

230
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:42,667
Okay, not gonna lie.

231
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:44,969
This is gonna be quick
but extremely painful.

232
00:11:48,942 --> 00:11:51,943
Oh, speaking of pain.
Eddie, hey.

233
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:53,712
Allen, we found the stolen
humvee in the alley

234
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:55,046
At Fremont and Lawrence.

235
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,147
Need you down here
to do your thing.

236
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:57,382
Great.

237
00:11:57,384 --> 00:12:00,452
I'll see you in a sec.
Okay.

238
00:12:00,454 --> 00:12:03,922
Okay.
Let's do this.

239
00:12:03,924 --> 00:12:08,927
So Barry, when you said
you were off-duty last night,

240
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:11,362
You weren't
visiting Iris again.

241
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:13,498
You know, in disguise?

242
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,502
'Cause that would be reckless
and a little creepy.

243
00:12:17,504 --> 00:12:18,737
No.

244
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:19,938
Good.

245
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:26,444
Allen, you really need a car.

246
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:28,513
I usually
manage on foot okay.

247
00:12:28,515 --> 00:12:29,914
What do we got?

248
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,683
The rig Tony Woodward
boosted last night.

249
00:12:31,685 --> 00:12:33,384
No sign of the stolen ATMs.

250
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:35,420
Probably got
those where he's holed up,

251
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:38,523
Though he's gonna have one hell
of a time breaking 'em open.

252
00:12:38,525 --> 00:12:41,926
I wouldn't be so sure.

253
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:44,496
So, about you and Iris...

254
00:12:44,498 --> 00:12:46,865
Look, Eddie, we had a fight,

255
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:49,667
And I just don't really
feel comfortable

256
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:51,269
Talking about it with you.

257
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:55,073
I get that, and I get that
you two go way back.

258
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:58,109
To be honest, I was a little
threatened by you at first.

259
00:12:58,111 --> 00:12:59,444
You were threatened by me?

260
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:00,945
Sure.

261
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:03,448
I mean, I've seen
how close you two are,

262
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,016
But you seem like a good guy,

263
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:08,286
And Iris, I just
want her to be happy.

264
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:11,656
From my experience,
good friends are hard to find.

265
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:13,992
Detective.
Excuse me.

266
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:17,128
Sir, we ran the plates
on that humvee...

267
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:20,398
Come on, Barry!
You can do it!

268
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,933
Barr, focus!

269
00:13:21,935 --> 00:13:23,735
I am!

270
00:13:23,737 --> 00:13:25,270
Son, son, son.

271
00:13:25,272 --> 00:13:27,572
You're getting frustrated.

272
00:13:27,574 --> 00:13:29,808
You need to learn
how to control your emotions.

273
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:32,343
Iris, come here, sweetie.

274
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:34,245
You want me to hit a girl?

275
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:35,780
He wants you to try.

276
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:37,282
Relax, Barry.

277
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:38,416
I've had her in gloves
since she was six.

278
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:40,819
She's tougher than she looks.

279
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:53,298
Sorry, Barry.

280
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,067
Son...

281
00:13:56,069 --> 00:14:00,338
Sometimes the best way to
win a fight is not to start one,

282
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,874
But if you do
come up against somebody

283
00:14:02,876 --> 00:14:04,676
You know
you can't beat, be smart.

284
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:06,578
It's okay to run
the other way.

285
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,146
All right?

286
00:14:08,148 --> 00:14:10,481
So what do you think?

287
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:14,686
Judging by the mud and kegs
I'd say he got hammered,

288
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:16,187
Stole a big-ass truck,

289
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:17,622
And went joyriding.

290
00:14:17,624 --> 00:14:19,357
I bet the kegs are stolen, too.

291
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,626
Rusty iron ale, it's a micro
brewed right over in...

292
00:14:21,628 --> 00:14:23,161
Keystone, I know the place.

293
00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:26,331
- Let's check it out.
- Yeah.

294
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:42,914
Barry described a tornado
of red and yellow lightning

295
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:45,550
Inside a man in yellow.

296
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:47,085
Then, bam.

297
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:48,653
He's blocks away on the street.

298
00:14:48,655 --> 00:14:50,355
Doesn't know how he got there.

299
00:14:50,357 --> 00:14:51,956
When I arrived,
the place was a wreck.

300
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,224
Nora Allen is dead.

301
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:54,859
Single stab wound
to the heart.

302
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:56,794
Henry Allen
covered in her blood.

303
00:14:56,796 --> 00:14:58,963
And despite all the evidence
that Henry Allen is guilty,

304
00:14:58,965 --> 00:15:03,601
Now you believe this... what,
man in yellow is responsible?

305
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:05,103
Last night, I saw Barry

306
00:15:05,105 --> 00:15:07,205
Rescue a young boy
from being run over,

307
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:10,541
And it looked exactly like what
Barry described happened to him.

308
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:12,277
It got me thinking,

309
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:16,881
What if somebody with Barry's
abilities killed Nora?

310
00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:18,716
There's one flaw with
your theory though, Detective,

311
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:22,520
And is that all of this
happened 14 years ago,

312
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:23,922
Which is long before...

313
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:25,456
Your machine gave Barry
his powers.

314
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,058
An accident gave Barry
his powers.

315
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,727
Do you think it is possible

316
00:15:29,729 --> 00:15:32,263
That somebody
with Barry's super-speed

317
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,299
Could have existed
before the explosion?

318
00:15:34,301 --> 00:15:37,435
Detective, I deal
in probabilities as a scientist,

319
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,871
And in this case...

320
00:15:39,873 --> 00:15:41,873
It's highly unlikely.

321
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:52,717
Gentlemen, CCPD.

322
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:54,118
Any chance
some of your merchandise

323
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,153
Was stolen last night?

324
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:57,588
No, I don't think so.

325
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:01,759
How about this guy?
You seen him?

326
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:06,197
You know Tony, don't you?

327
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:11,469
Hey.

328
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:14,038
Allen, come on!

329
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,288
Allen, you okay?

330
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,323
- Oh, never better.
- Get up.

331
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,791
I didn't do nothing, man!

332
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:35,193
So why'd you run?

333
00:16:35,195 --> 00:16:37,695
- Look, it was an accident!
- What was?

334
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:40,031
Tony falling, okay?

335
00:16:40,033 --> 00:16:42,967
But I swear to god,
we didn't kill him!

336
00:16:42,969 --> 00:16:44,369
Keep talking.

337
00:16:44,371 --> 00:16:47,205
About ten months ago,
Keystone Ironworks.

338
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:49,307
Boss is handing out pink slips.

339
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:52,143
Tony gets his,
and he just snapped.

340
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:54,212
He started beating the crap
out of the guy.

341
00:16:54,214 --> 00:16:57,181
We pulled him off,
and then the lights went out.

342
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:59,784
Some kind of power surge.
And then Tony

343
00:16:59,786 --> 00:17:03,321
Went over the railing right
into a vat of molten scrap.

344
00:17:03,323 --> 00:17:04,856
Just gone.

345
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,657
Lucky for you
he's still alive.

346
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:08,893
What?

347
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:10,661
How'd you get in front of us?

348
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:12,663
Shortcut.

349
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,902
♪ When I was just a boy,
my mama... ♪

350
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:21,439
I've been meaning to ask you,
where's your shadow?

351
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:22,840
What shadow?

352
00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:25,676
Barry.
He hasn't been in all week.

353
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:27,612
Getting his fix
somewhere else.

354
00:17:27,614 --> 00:17:29,280
Too bad.

355
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:33,284
He's cute, I kind of miss
having him around.

356
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:37,886
Iris?
Long time no see.

357
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,800
I got to say,
Iris, you look amazing.

358
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:51,203
Thanks, Tony.

359
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,371
Um, you too.

360
00:17:53,373 --> 00:17:54,772
Oh, yeah.
I keep in shape.

361
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:56,674
I got a gym at my place.

362
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:58,676
Been living out in Keystone
on the west side,

363
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:02,246
And you should, uh...
you should stop by sometime.

364
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:04,182
So, uh,
can I get you a drink?

365
00:18:04,184 --> 00:18:06,851
No, I came to see you.

366
00:18:06,853 --> 00:18:08,286
How did you know I was here?

367
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:10,088
I've been reading up
on the Streak.

368
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:12,056
Found your little blog.

369
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:14,225
Why are you writing
about this guy?

370
00:18:14,227 --> 00:18:16,961
People say that he's a hero.

371
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:19,230
I say he's a coward,

372
00:18:19,232 --> 00:18:20,965
And I happen to know that he
took a beating last night

373
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:24,602
And ran off like a little girl.
You should write about that.

374
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:28,172
Do you have any idea

375
00:18:28,174 --> 00:18:30,641
Who leather boy is?

376
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:31,943
No clue.

377
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:33,945
So, um,
if you don't want a drink

378
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:35,480
I should probably
get back to work.

379
00:18:35,482 --> 00:18:39,083
Actually I'd prefer to buy you
a drink.

380
00:18:39,085 --> 00:18:41,619
What time you off?
Thanks, Tony,

381
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,754
But I don't think
my boyfriend would approve.

382
00:18:43,756 --> 00:18:46,057
He's a cop, like my dad.

383
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:48,593
I never really did like cops
too much.

384
00:18:48,595 --> 00:18:50,795
Iris!

385
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:57,268
Well he's picking me up
for the policeman's ball.

386
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,903
Wall-to-wall cops.
Can't swing a cat.

387
00:18:58,905 --> 00:19:01,072
I should probably call
him to see where he is...

388
00:19:01,074 --> 00:19:04,509
Give me the phone, Iris.
Now!

389
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:16,888
I'm sorry.
Uh, for the damage.

390
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:20,958
We'll pick this up
some other time.

391
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:32,003
Barry!
Check it out!

392
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:34,372
The gravel
you pulled from Tony's ride?

393
00:19:34,374 --> 00:19:36,407
It contains 76.8% hematite.

394
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:39,677
Consistent with the mines
at Keystone Ironworks.

395
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,013
Which closed
down ten months ago.

396
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:43,514
It's the perfect hideout.

397
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:46,717
Barry, do you mind telling me
about this?

398
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:49,153
"I have info about someone
you're looking for.

399
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:50,388
"He was here.

400
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:54,392
You know where to find me."

401
00:19:54,394 --> 00:19:57,795
Now who could she be
talking to?

402
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:12,176
I guess you got my message.

403
00:20:12,178 --> 00:20:14,312
Are you okay?

404
00:20:14,314 --> 00:20:16,981
Cop's daughter.
I can handle myself.

405
00:20:16,983 --> 00:20:18,749
Not with this guy.

406
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:21,219
I knew him when we were kids.
He didn't want to hurt me.

407
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:22,820
He wanted to impress me,

408
00:20:22,822 --> 00:20:25,489
But he is fixated on you,
and not in a good way.

409
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:27,225
Do you know where he went?

410
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:29,560
He said he had a place
out in West Keystone.

411
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:32,897
Bragged about how big it was,
but I have no idea where.

412
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:35,967
- I do.
- Wait, there's something else.

413
00:20:35,969 --> 00:20:37,235
His hand.

414
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:41,472
It transformed
like an iron fist.

415
00:20:41,474 --> 00:20:43,708
He's like you, isn't he?

416
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:47,712
Yes, and writing about me
is what brought him to you.

417
00:20:47,714 --> 00:20:49,080
I know,
but maybe I could talk...

418
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:52,383
No!
He's too dangerous.

419
00:20:54,687 --> 00:20:56,654
Damn, that's my ride.

420
00:20:56,656 --> 00:20:58,689
Eddie insisted on a detail.

421
00:20:58,691 --> 00:21:01,859
I have to... go.

422
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:07,265
Barry, talk to us.
What are you doing?

423
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:12,470
Dude, don't run angry.

424
00:21:12,472 --> 00:21:15,606
We don't know
how to defeat him yet.

425
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:54,478
This is definitely the place.

426
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:01,686
You're trespassing, freak!

427
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:05,856
There's nowhere left to run.

428
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:14,932
- Barry?
- Barry, where are you?

429
00:22:14,934 --> 00:22:16,600
Caitlin, over here!

430
00:22:16,602 --> 00:22:19,770
Barry?
Please, say something!

431
00:22:19,772 --> 00:22:23,874
Say something
so we know you're okay.

432
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:27,876
- Ow.
- Get him out of there!

433
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,180
What were you thinking?

434
00:22:29,282 --> 00:22:30,812
What were you thinking?

435
00:22:30,817 --> 00:22:33,017
I told you
that we would figure out a way

436
00:22:33,052 --> 00:22:34,452
- to deal with him.
- I'll heal.

437
00:22:34,454 --> 00:22:36,020
You can't heal
when you're dead.

438
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:37,288
He could have killed you.

439
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:39,824
I know, all right?
I know!

440
00:22:39,826 --> 00:22:42,326
In the past 36 hours
I've had my ass

441
00:22:42,328 --> 00:22:45,129
Handed to me twice by the guy
that tortured me as a kid.

442
00:22:45,131 --> 00:22:48,099
I couldn't stop him then,
and I can't stop him now!

443
00:22:48,101 --> 00:22:50,668
Even with my powers
I'm still powerless against him.

444
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:52,870
Not necessarily.

445
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:54,205
Cisco?

446
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:55,940
Any material,

447
00:22:55,942 --> 00:23:00,177
If struck at a high enough
velocity can be compromised.

448
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:03,280
We ran an analysis on
the metal in Tony's footprint.

449
00:23:03,282 --> 00:23:05,616
Based on its density
and atomic structure,

450
00:23:05,618 --> 00:23:08,586
If you impact it
at just the right angle,

451
00:23:08,588 --> 00:23:13,190
At just the right speed, you
could do some serious damage.

452
00:23:13,192 --> 00:23:14,892
How fast would I have to go?

453
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:16,660
Factoring in the metal's
tensile strength,

454
00:23:16,662 --> 00:23:20,498
Estimated dermal thickness,
atmospheric pressure, air temp,

455
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:24,368
You'd have to hit him
at approximately...

456
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:26,704
Mach 1.1.

457
00:23:26,706 --> 00:23:29,774
You want Barry to hit
something at 800 miles an hour?

458
00:23:29,776 --> 00:23:32,610
837, actually.

459
00:23:32,612 --> 00:23:33,844
That's faster than the speed
of sound.

460
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:35,212
I know.

461
00:23:35,214 --> 00:23:37,047
He would create a sonic boom,

462
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:39,950
Which, as I've said before,
would be awesome.

463
00:23:39,952 --> 00:23:41,519
I've never gone that fast.

464
00:23:41,521 --> 00:23:43,287
Yet.

465
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:46,257
I can't believe we're actually
entertaining this idea.

466
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:49,226
I mean, he'd need
a straight shot from miles away

467
00:23:49,228 --> 00:23:51,896
Yeah, 5.3 miles,
theoretically.

468
00:23:51,898 --> 00:23:56,600
Do it right,
you'll take him down.

469
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:58,502
Do it wrong,

470
00:23:58,504 --> 00:24:02,740
You'll shatter every bone
in your body.

471
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:08,779
Barry.

472
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:09,981
Joe, I've been
beaten up enough for one day.

473
00:24:09,982 --> 00:24:12,116
- I gotta...
- Hey, wait.

474
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:15,019
An anonymous tip led us
to Tony Woodward's hideout.

475
00:24:15,021 --> 00:24:16,787
The place was trashed.
What happened?

476
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:18,789
He shows up at jitters
to see Iris.

477
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:20,558
I had to go after him.
Iris, where is she?

478
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,892
She's fine, she's fine.

479
00:24:21,894 --> 00:24:24,161
Eddie put a detail
on her to be safe.

480
00:24:24,163 --> 00:24:26,263
I thought I could
handle him this time.

481
00:24:26,265 --> 00:24:27,731
I tried.

482
00:24:27,733 --> 00:24:30,301
Look, I know what this punk
put you through,

483
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:34,271
But you can't let emotion
cloud your judgment.

484
00:24:34,273 --> 00:24:36,407
The tollbooth camera
got a shot of Woodward.

485
00:24:36,409 --> 00:24:38,075
Stolen car headed out of town.

486
00:24:38,077 --> 00:24:40,577
State police are taking over.

487
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,580
- We lost him.
- Don't worry, Eddie.

488
00:24:42,582 --> 00:24:43,848
They'll get him.

489
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:45,115
I wanted
to take this guy down.

490
00:24:45,117 --> 00:24:47,451
Not half as much as I did.

491
00:24:47,453 --> 00:24:49,086
Let's go, Allen.

492
00:24:49,088 --> 00:24:50,154
Go where?

493
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:51,222
Blow off some steam.

494
00:24:51,224 --> 00:24:53,624
- I need to hit something.
- What?

495
00:24:53,626 --> 00:24:55,092
I don't think he meant
hit you.

496
00:24:55,094 --> 00:24:57,428
Go.

497
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:09,306
So I heard you and this
Woodward guy have a history.

498
00:25:09,308 --> 00:25:10,808
Hey, Allen.

499
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:12,543
It's okay.
Trust me.

500
00:25:12,545 --> 00:25:14,745
I had my fair share of bullies
at school.

501
00:25:14,747 --> 00:25:17,081
Yeah, somehow I find
that hard to believe.

502
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:21,485
I was short, fat,
and the son of a politician

503
00:25:21,487 --> 00:25:23,420
Who closed the factory
in my school district,

504
00:25:23,422 --> 00:25:26,991
So not so popular.

505
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:31,662
So what'd you do about it?

506
00:25:31,664 --> 00:25:33,731
I got my ass kicked.

507
00:25:33,733 --> 00:25:39,003
A lot, until my gym coach
took pity on me.

508
00:25:39,005 --> 00:25:41,672
She said the key
to fighting is patience.

509
00:25:41,674 --> 00:25:43,674
Here.

510
00:25:43,676 --> 00:25:47,211
A lot of guys waste energy
trying to land the most punches.

511
00:25:47,213 --> 00:25:51,382
All it takes is one,
but you got to make it count.

512
00:25:51,384 --> 00:25:54,585
Choose your spot
and drive through it,

513
00:25:54,587 --> 00:25:58,055
Like it's six inches
behind the target.

514
00:26:04,763 --> 00:26:07,264
Harder.

515
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:14,138
Harder!

516
00:26:19,946 --> 00:26:24,381
The seam
was starting to split.

517
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:30,721
Appreciate you coming down.

518
00:26:30,723 --> 00:26:33,357
Hmm, well these days
it's rare to find someone

519
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:36,594
Happy to have a drink with me.

520
00:26:36,596 --> 00:26:41,131
Well, our conversation
yesterday got me thinking.

521
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:43,867
You said, as a scientist,
you look for the probable?

522
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:45,235
That's right.

523
00:26:45,237 --> 00:26:47,538
And we both recently
have seen things

524
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:50,741
That have redefined
what is possible.

525
00:26:50,743 --> 00:26:52,943
Yes, we have,
and we both know

526
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:54,111
The direct cause
of those things.

527
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:55,913
Your accelerator explosion.

528
00:26:55,915 --> 00:26:58,882
Evolutionary leaps follow the
creation of new technologies.

529
00:26:58,884 --> 00:27:00,117
It's that simple.

530
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:03,520
Like the Roomba.

531
00:27:03,522 --> 00:27:08,158
Yes, like the Roomba.

532
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,362
So humor me here.

533
00:27:11,364 --> 00:27:12,997
Hmm?

534
00:27:12,999 --> 00:27:17,668
If we know that meta-humans
were created

535
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:20,537
By the particle accelerator
and testimony shows

536
00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:23,173
That a meta-human may have been
involved in the murder

537
00:27:23,175 --> 00:27:27,978
Of Barry Allen's mother 14 years
ago, it seems to me that...

538
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:31,181
Way back then
there must have been

539
00:27:31,183 --> 00:27:36,186
Another particle accelerator.

540
00:27:36,188 --> 00:27:39,657
- Another particle accelerator?
- Hmm.

541
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:42,292
I can assure you that's
extremely unlikely, Detective,

542
00:27:42,294 --> 00:27:45,763
And if they were I don't recall
any dark matter lightning storms

543
00:27:45,765 --> 00:27:47,431
Before I moved to town.

544
00:27:47,433 --> 00:27:50,467
Do you?

545
00:27:50,469 --> 00:27:55,839
No, no, I don't.

546
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:59,543
When did you move to town,
Dr. Wells?

547
00:28:07,218 --> 00:28:10,888
Something tells me
that you already know the answer

548
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:12,523
To that question, Detective.

549
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:17,861
This whole "help me solve
the murder of Nora Allen,"

550
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:20,531
You were never
looking for my help, were you?

551
00:28:20,533 --> 00:28:25,002
You opened your lab a month
after Nora Allen's murder.

552
00:28:25,004 --> 00:28:26,737
Would you mind telling me
what you were doing

553
00:28:26,739 --> 00:28:30,441
In Central City before that?

554
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:35,345
I was starting over.

555
00:28:35,347 --> 00:28:39,583
Starting what over?

556
00:28:39,585 --> 00:28:43,053
Here I thought
we were just two guys

557
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:45,222
Having a friendly drink.

558
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:46,657
You want answers, Detective?

559
00:28:46,659 --> 00:28:48,692
Tess Morgan, look her up.

560
00:29:01,005 --> 00:29:02,606
Unit 52, this is dispatch.

561
00:29:02,608 --> 00:29:04,942
Requesting status update
on the west house.

562
00:29:04,944 --> 00:29:06,777
Unh!

563
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:19,757
Hey, Iris.

564
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:30,601
- Nice, Allen.
- Yeah.

565
00:29:30,603 --> 00:29:32,136
- All right.
- Okay.

566
00:29:32,138 --> 00:29:33,670
Hey, next time
work on your speed.

567
00:29:33,672 --> 00:29:36,907
Yeah, I'll do my best.

568
00:29:36,909 --> 00:29:39,243
Thawne, Allen.

569
00:29:39,245 --> 00:29:41,345
The unit watching Joe's
daughter, they've been attacked.

570
00:29:41,347 --> 00:29:44,014
Iris is missing.

571
00:29:44,016 --> 00:29:48,752
Go, all right?
I'll call Joe.

572
00:29:48,754 --> 00:29:51,922
Let's adjust the impact angle
by .2 degrees,

573
00:29:51,924 --> 00:29:54,324
Up the speed to 838.

574
00:29:54,326 --> 00:29:57,826
Bam.

575
00:29:58,397 --> 00:30:00,997
- Ouch.
- Ouch?

576
00:30:01,066 --> 00:30:02,132
Guys, you there?

577
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:03,634
Yeah, man, what's up?

578
00:30:03,636 --> 00:30:05,269
Tony took Iris.

579
00:30:05,271 --> 00:30:06,670
I need you to do whatever you
can to help me find her.

580
00:30:06,672 --> 00:30:08,305
All right?
Satellites, security cameras.

581
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:10,274
- Hack 'em all.
- We're on it.

582
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:16,413
What's wrong?

583
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:25,189
Remember this place, Iris?

584
00:30:25,191 --> 00:30:27,591
So what's the plan here,
Tony?

585
00:30:27,593 --> 00:30:29,626
You finally gonna
go for that G.E.D?

586
00:30:29,628 --> 00:30:31,261
You want a plan?
How's this?

587
00:30:31,263 --> 00:30:32,596
You used to write
about the Streak, right?

588
00:30:32,598 --> 00:30:34,464
Now you're gonna write
about me.

589
00:30:34,466 --> 00:30:36,466
You just abducted me, Tony.
Why would I do that?

590
00:30:36,468 --> 00:30:39,736
Because the Streak is dead.

591
00:30:39,738 --> 00:30:41,271
No.

592
00:30:41,273 --> 00:30:44,007
Squashed like a little bug
by me.

593
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:45,609
So if you don't want
the same thing to happen to you,

594
00:30:45,611 --> 00:30:47,077
You're gonna
tell the whole world

595
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:49,980
That there's a new big man
on campus!

596
00:30:49,982 --> 00:30:52,583
And I'm just getting started.

597
00:30:52,585 --> 00:30:53,984
You could have
anybody write about you, Tony.

598
00:30:53,986 --> 00:30:55,853
Why me?

599
00:30:55,855 --> 00:30:59,289
'Cause I like you, Iris.
Always have.

600
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:07,030
You should have said
something.

601
00:31:08,334 --> 00:31:10,467
You try anything
like that again

602
00:31:10,469 --> 00:31:14,571
And I'm gonna leave
more than a bruise!

603
00:31:14,573 --> 00:31:16,640
Eddie, anything yet?

604
00:31:16,642 --> 00:31:18,675
We have roadblocks
on every major artery.

605
00:31:18,677 --> 00:31:20,244
Units are searching.

606
00:31:20,246 --> 00:31:22,813
We will find Iris, Joe.

607
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:29,720
You don't think
he'll hurt her, do you?

608
00:31:29,722 --> 00:31:33,223
Sir, sir, we got a fire alarm
call at Carmichael elementary.

609
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:35,525
Dispatch the fire department.
We'll send backup when we can.

610
00:31:35,527 --> 00:31:36,960
That's the school
you and Iris went to.

611
00:31:36,962 --> 00:31:40,564
- And Tony.
- Go.

612
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:48,205
Tony, turn yourself
in before things get worse.

613
00:31:48,207 --> 00:31:49,673
It's not too late.

614
00:31:49,675 --> 00:31:51,375
Yeah, it is.

615
00:31:51,377 --> 00:31:53,510
Cops are already looking for me,

616
00:31:53,512 --> 00:31:56,146
So get ready to cover
the showdown of a lifetime

617
00:31:56,148 --> 00:32:00,384
'cause I'm not going out
without a fight.

618
00:32:00,386 --> 00:32:03,620
Good,
'cause you just found one.

619
00:32:03,622 --> 00:32:05,822
You just won't stay dead.

620
00:32:05,824 --> 00:32:08,258
Come to save
your little fan girl?

621
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,127
This is between us.

622
00:32:10,129 --> 00:32:13,797
Let her go.

623
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:16,633
Oh, I could,
but I'd rather make her watch

624
00:32:16,635 --> 00:32:21,438
While I break every bone
in your body.

625
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:32,416
- Wait here.
- Okay.

626
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:41,758
Too slow, tin man.

627
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,761
- Aah!
- I've known guys like you.

628
00:32:44,763 --> 00:32:46,797
Peaked in high school.
Never got over it.

629
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:49,232
All these powers,
and look at you!

630
00:32:49,234 --> 00:32:52,636
Bully then, bully now.

631
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:12,956
- He's hurt.
- No!

632
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:23,934
If you do come up
against somebody you know you

633
00:33:23,936 --> 00:33:25,102
Can't beat, be smart.

634
00:33:25,104 --> 00:33:28,538
It's okay to run the other way.

635
00:33:35,113 --> 00:33:38,281
There goes your hero.

636
00:33:41,452 --> 00:33:43,320
He made it out.

637
00:33:43,322 --> 00:33:47,357
Barely.

638
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,462
Why did he stop?

639
00:33:52,464 --> 00:33:54,965
He's miles away.

640
00:33:54,967 --> 00:33:59,936
5.3 miles away.

641
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:08,912
- Barry, wait!
- No way.

642
00:34:08,914 --> 00:34:11,415
He's gonna do it!

643
00:34:11,417 --> 00:34:15,285
Go, man, go!

644
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:37,274
Unh!

645
00:34:37,276 --> 00:34:39,276
Supersonic punch, baby!

646
00:34:39,278 --> 00:34:40,544
Whoo!

647
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:54,925
Nice cross.

648
00:34:54,927 --> 00:34:58,328
- Yeah, I think I broke my hand.
- Oh, me too.

649
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:11,608
Hey!
What is this?

650
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,276
Where the hell am I?

651
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:16,646
Somewhere you'll never
hurt anyone ever again.

652
00:35:16,648 --> 00:35:19,616
Who the hell
do you think you are?

653
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:25,856
You know who I am.

654
00:35:25,858 --> 00:35:27,257
Allen?

655
00:35:27,259 --> 00:35:29,793
The thing
that happened to you, Tony,

656
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:32,262
It happened to me too,

657
00:35:32,264 --> 00:35:34,164
But it didn't just
give us abilities.

658
00:35:34,166 --> 00:35:37,167
It made us more of who we are.

659
00:35:37,169 --> 00:35:39,269
You got strong.

660
00:35:39,271 --> 00:35:41,671
I got fast.

661
00:35:41,673 --> 00:35:45,242
Fast enough to beat you.

662
00:35:45,244 --> 00:35:49,980
You used your gift
to hurt people.

663
00:35:49,982 --> 00:35:52,249
Not anymore.

664
00:35:52,251 --> 00:35:54,017
Allen.

665
00:35:54,019 --> 00:35:55,418
Allen.

666
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,920
Allen, don't walk away from me,
Allen!

667
00:35:56,922 --> 00:35:59,289
Hey!
Come back here!

668
00:35:59,291 --> 00:36:02,726
Allen!
Allen!

669
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:06,530
Dude, that had to feel great.

670
00:36:06,532 --> 00:36:08,865
- You have no idea.
- Almost as good

671
00:36:08,867 --> 00:36:10,867
As proving me wrong
about the supersonic punch?

672
00:36:10,869 --> 00:36:15,305
Actually, that part hurt.
Like, a lot.

673
00:36:15,307 --> 00:36:17,741
But I couldn't have
done it without you guys.

674
00:36:17,743 --> 00:36:20,710
All I want to know
is which childhood bully

675
00:36:20,712 --> 00:36:22,472
Are we gonna take down next?

676
00:36:22,481 --> 00:36:24,314
<i>- Mine or Caitlin's?</i>
- Okay, yeah.

677
00:36:24,316 --> 00:36:26,082
I vote mine.
What?

678
00:36:26,084 --> 00:36:29,085
Guys, this is not a joke.

679
00:36:29,087 --> 00:36:31,354
Doctor.

680
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:33,056
Detective.

681
00:36:33,058 --> 00:36:36,059
Are you here to make
more accusations?

682
00:36:36,061 --> 00:36:39,629
I'm here to make amends.

683
00:36:39,631 --> 00:36:42,666
I looked up Tess Morgan.

684
00:36:42,668 --> 00:36:46,670
I'm sorry for your loss.

685
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:55,378
You two were research partners
in Maryland?

686
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:58,748
Yes, we were.
We were...

687
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,884
Married to the work
as much as to each other.

688
00:37:00,886 --> 00:37:04,221
After the car accident...

689
00:37:04,223 --> 00:37:06,990
I could not go back to the work.

690
00:37:06,992 --> 00:37:08,858
Could not go back to our lab.

691
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:12,395
So you moved here.

692
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:15,198
Where no one knew me.

693
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,602
Where no one could remind me
of what I had lost,

694
00:37:21,138 --> 00:37:24,040
And, um...

695
00:37:24,042 --> 00:37:26,409
I...

696
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:29,379
I found it difficult,

697
00:37:29,381 --> 00:37:31,982
Starting over,

698
00:37:31,984 --> 00:37:35,785
Rebuilding,

699
00:37:35,787 --> 00:37:39,789
And what took me 14 years
Tess could have done in 4,

700
00:37:39,791 --> 00:37:43,927
Believe me,
she... she...

701
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:51,134
At the time
of Nora Allen's murder,

702
00:37:51,136 --> 00:37:53,637
The particle accelerator that I
would eventually create

703
00:37:53,639 --> 00:37:55,405
Was...
but a notion,

704
00:37:55,407 --> 00:37:57,207
Much less a reality,

705
00:37:57,209 --> 00:38:01,578
And so whomever or whatever is
responsible for her death,

706
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:06,883
It did not originate
from me or from my work.

707
00:38:06,885 --> 00:38:09,219
I'm sorry I doubted you,

708
00:38:09,221 --> 00:38:13,123
But I hope I can still
count on your help.

709
00:38:19,765 --> 00:38:21,298
You don't give up, do you?

710
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,467
Nope.
Not till I get my man.

711
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:28,338
I owe that to Barry
and to Henry.

712
00:38:30,107 --> 00:38:34,210
Barry is lucky
to have you on his side, Joe.

713
00:38:43,889 --> 00:38:47,057
Hi.

714
00:38:47,059 --> 00:38:50,293
Oh, I thought
that you were someone else.

715
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:56,866
So Joe told me what happened.

716
00:38:56,868 --> 00:38:59,269
How's the hand?

717
00:38:59,271 --> 00:39:03,340
Not broken,
so that's something.

718
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:12,882
- I should have believed...
- I'm sorry I said...

719
00:39:12,884 --> 00:39:14,784
I've missed you.

720
00:39:14,786 --> 00:39:18,388
Yeah, I've missed you too.

721
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:23,760
When I heard
Tony took you, I...

722
00:39:23,762 --> 00:39:25,261
I just...
I don't know what I would do

723
00:39:25,263 --> 00:39:27,430
If anything happened to you.

724
00:39:27,432 --> 00:39:32,702
Well, my guardian angel's
looking out for me.

725
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:35,872
Do you want to hang out
and catch up?

726
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:37,040
Yeah.

727
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:38,575
I would like that, yeah.

728
00:39:38,577 --> 00:39:40,710
I promise not to talk
about the Streak tonight.

729
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:42,078
No, I want you to.

730
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,246
No, I mean, I want... you can...

731
00:39:43,248 --> 00:39:44,748
I want you to talk

732
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:46,015
About whatever you'd want
to talk about.

733
00:39:46,017 --> 00:39:47,350
I know it's important to you.

734
00:39:47,352 --> 00:39:49,886
Good because it's not
just the Streak.

735
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:52,689
There are others out there
that are like him.

736
00:39:52,691 --> 00:39:55,525
I've gotten scattered posts
about this guy that's on fire,

737
00:39:55,527 --> 00:39:57,260
Except that he doesn't burn up.

738
00:39:57,262 --> 00:39:58,828
Okay, so wait.
Wait.

739
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:02,332
You're trying to find
the burning man now too?

740
00:40:02,334 --> 00:40:04,100
Yeah, why not?
I mean, a lot can happen

741
00:40:04,102 --> 00:40:05,502
In a week,
especially with the Streak.

742
00:40:05,504 --> 00:40:07,404
Heh.

743
00:40:07,406 --> 00:40:09,205
I've been trying to
get answers from him.

744
00:40:09,207 --> 00:40:10,840
Where does he come from?
How does he do what he does?

745
00:40:10,842 --> 00:40:12,342
But he dodges everything.

746
00:40:12,344 --> 00:40:16,679
Literally,
with this super-speed power.

747
00:40:16,681 --> 00:40:20,350
When he moves, Barry,
you don't even see him.

748
00:40:20,352 --> 00:40:22,352
He comes and goes
in the blink of an eye,

749
00:40:22,354 --> 00:40:25,889
- In a...
- Flash?

750
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:32,662
In a flash.

751
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:40,103
Yeah.

752
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:45,608
Today, I was saved by
the impossible.

753
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:49,045
A mystery man.
The fastest man alive.

754
00:40:49,047 --> 00:40:53,349
Then a friend gave me an idea
for a new name,

755
00:40:53,351 --> 00:40:58,354
And something tells me
it's gonna catch on.

756
00:42:25,643 --> 00:42:27,143
Greg, move your head.
