1
00:00:03,087 --> 00:00:04,207
[Black Lightning] Injustice?

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:07,799
Damn.

3
00:00:08,676 --> 00:00:12,347
Look, Barry, those protocols
are a one-way trip, and a bad one.

4
00:00:12,472 --> 00:00:13,723
- I know that.
- All right.

5
00:00:14,557 --> 00:00:15,557
All right.

6
00:00:16,518 --> 00:00:19,229
- Just take a deep breath.
- [breathing heavily]

7
00:00:20,355 --> 00:00:21,355
Tell me what happened.

8
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:26,736
In the last 24 hours,
I've lost my job, my home base.

9
00:00:26,945 --> 00:00:28,404
[breathing heavily]

10
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,198
I started having blackouts.

11
00:00:32,075 --> 00:00:33,826
I destroyed my apartment at super speed.

12
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:36,246
I attacked my team, my family.

13
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:38,824
Jefferson, I attacked innocent people.
Dozens of them.

14
00:00:38,873 --> 00:00:41,292
And I don't remember doing it.
I'm out of control!

15
00:00:41,376 --> 00:00:42,418
Easy.

16
00:00:43,545 --> 00:00:46,506
In my experience, there's almost
nothing that can't be undone.

17
00:00:46,589 --> 00:00:48,275
But I'm gonna need you
to calm down for a minute.

18
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:49,899
[yelling] Calm down? I'm losing my mind.

19
00:00:51,636 --> 00:00:53,388
Look, you know the contingency plan.

20
00:00:54,514 --> 00:00:56,808
The Injustice Protocols were put
into place for a reason.

21
00:00:57,684 --> 00:00:59,769
To protect the world
when one of us goes rogue.

22
00:01:00,687 --> 00:01:02,230
It's happening, Jefferson.

23
00:01:03,398 --> 00:01:05,024
You have to take away my powers.

24
00:01:35,221 --> 00:01:37,032
- We need to call in the others.
- We don't have time.

25
00:01:37,056 --> 00:01:38,850
No, Kara, J'onn, Sara.

26
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:41,603
We all designed this plan together
after Faust.

27
00:01:41,686 --> 00:01:43,062
We all made the same promise!

28
00:01:43,396 --> 00:01:46,899
If <i>anyone</i> ever lost control,
a designated teammate would step in.

29
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,151
For me, that's you.

30
00:01:48,234 --> 00:01:49,944
And I don't carry that weight lightly.

31
00:01:52,322 --> 00:01:55,241
What if this is all temporary?
What if your mind starts healing?

32
00:01:55,325 --> 00:01:57,219
It's not going to heal.
It's only gonna get worse.

33
00:01:57,243 --> 00:01:58,578
How can you say that for sure?

34
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:04,751
I forgot Joe died.

35
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,088
The man who raised me.

36
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:15,345
He passed away six months ago
and I can't remember it... at all.

37
00:02:18,056 --> 00:02:20,433
Look, I know you have questions,

38
00:02:20,558 --> 00:02:22,060
but I'm losing myself.

39
00:02:23,102 --> 00:02:24,102
You took an oath.

40
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:27,482
If I ever said the word "injustice,"
you'd listen.

41
00:02:29,275 --> 00:02:32,779
Please... we have to do this now.

42
00:02:39,118 --> 00:02:41,496
My father had a saying.

43
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:44,999
One that I even teach my students today.

44
00:02:46,584 --> 00:02:48,294
"Where's the future? Right here.

45
00:02:49,087 --> 00:02:50,672
Whose life is this? Mine.

46
00:02:51,297 --> 00:02:54,050
And what are you going do with it?
Live it, by any means necessary."

47
00:02:54,133 --> 00:02:56,177
So don't worry. I will honor my promise.

48
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,971
I will do whatever is necessary
to keep folks alive.

49
00:02:59,055 --> 00:03:01,057
But remember...

50
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:06,187
when we take away your powers,
they are gone...

51
00:03:07,397 --> 00:03:08,397
permanently.

52
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,156
[intense music playing]

53
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:18,908
[Human Despero] <i>It's happening again.</i>

54
00:03:20,368 --> 00:03:22,286
<i>Another world lost.</i>

55
00:03:23,705 --> 00:03:24,914
<i>Another failure.</i>

56
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,167
<i>Armageddon waits for no man.</i>

57
00:03:33,506 --> 00:03:38,052
<i>And it won't wait
for me to find you, Flash.</i>

58
00:03:39,846 --> 00:03:41,889
[Chester] You think Despero was right,

59
00:03:41,973 --> 00:03:44,183
that Barry's gonna destroy
the world or something?

60
00:03:44,267 --> 00:03:47,770
No. Hey, what Barry did today was scary.

61
00:03:48,396 --> 00:03:50,732
And the things that he said,
they really, really hurt.

62
00:03:51,607 --> 00:03:54,610
But someone that we love
is going through a mental health crisis,

63
00:03:54,694 --> 00:03:59,323
so I don't care what he may
or may not do ten years from now.

64
00:04:00,658 --> 00:04:04,871
We need to take care of him today,
just like he did for me.

65
00:04:06,122 --> 00:04:08,875
Okay, we'll follow your lead.
What do you want to do?

66
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:12,462
Okay. I've been sensing Despero all day.

67
00:04:12,962 --> 00:04:15,173
He's using his mind's eye
to scan the city.

68
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:18,217
Now, he hasn't found him yet,
but if Barry's not thinking clearly...

69
00:04:18,301 --> 00:04:20,470
What if he's the only one
thinking clearly?

70
00:04:20,678 --> 00:04:23,097
Boss, what are you talking about?

71
00:04:23,473 --> 00:04:26,726
Look, I know how this is gonna sound,
but when Despero showed up,

72
00:04:26,809 --> 00:04:29,228
he said that Barry would suffer tragedy.

73
00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:31,397
And then on cue, he lost his job,

74
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:33,149
he lost S.T.A.R. Labs, and now...

75
00:04:33,733 --> 00:04:34,817
he's lost his mind.

76
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,528
Doesn't that seem like
a big coincidence?

77
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:39,489
A little too big?

78
00:04:39,572 --> 00:04:43,075
But Despero's from the future.
Wouldn't he know what happened?

79
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:46,579
But what if he didn't know that
someone secretly caused it to happen?

80
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:48,206
You think he's being framed?

81
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:49,289
[Cecile] Iris.

82
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,043
He forgot about Joe.

83
00:04:52,794 --> 00:04:54,170
Nobody was framing him then.

84
00:04:55,463 --> 00:04:56,547
Yeah, I'm not so sure.

85
00:04:57,423 --> 00:05:01,928
Look, when Dad died, C.C.P.D said
that his death was an accident,

86
00:05:03,012 --> 00:05:05,890
that he fell on the tracks
at Scott Railway.

87
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:08,226
Kramer left me with the evidence,

88
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:11,813
but for the last six months,
I haven't been able to look at it.

89
00:05:12,146 --> 00:05:14,398
But then I thought about
what Barry said,

90
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:17,693
that we have to investigate
what happened.

91
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:21,656
- So I finally started looking...
- [laptop beeps]

92
00:05:22,073 --> 00:05:23,193
...and this is what I found.

93
00:05:23,241 --> 00:05:24,283
Joe.

94
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:26,619
Why are you showing us this?

95
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:28,454
Just trust me.

96
00:05:34,043 --> 00:05:36,087
See, one second he's there
and the next, he's gone.

97
00:05:36,671 --> 00:05:39,590
I haven't figured this all out yet,
but if somebody framed Barry,

98
00:05:40,383 --> 00:05:45,513
then he doesn't cause Armageddon,
and, Cecile, Dad could be alive.

99
00:05:46,931 --> 00:05:49,141
No, no, it's impossible.

100
00:05:49,225 --> 00:05:50,225
Is it?

101
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:53,896
I mean, what if a meta-human
abducted him at the last second

102
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,357
or he got swapped
with like, a Mirror clone?

103
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,360
I saw them bury his body.

104
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,780
So did Barry, and so did you.

105
00:06:02,864 --> 00:06:05,324
Okay, guys, how about we take five?

106
00:06:05,408 --> 00:06:06,659
I'm not trying to upset you.

107
00:06:06,742 --> 00:06:08,911
Then what are you trying to do?

108
00:06:08,995 --> 00:06:12,164
I'm trying to find out
if my dad is still alive.

109
00:06:12,248 --> 00:06:14,166
I'm trying to prove
my husband's innocence.

110
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,420
It does not matter if he is innocent,
if we can't find him,

111
00:06:17,587 --> 00:06:19,505
which is what we have been trying to do

112
00:06:19,589 --> 00:06:22,049
while you have been living
in a fantasy world.

113
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:23,133
Hey.

114
00:06:24,969 --> 00:06:27,847
Iris has trusted Barry
against the odds before,

115
00:06:28,723 --> 00:06:32,977
like, when Bloodwork infected him
and she was right.

116
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:36,147
If there's even a chance
that this could be real,

117
00:06:36,856 --> 00:06:41,027
I can't give up
and you wouldn't want me to.

118
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,321
Is that what you think?
You think I gave up?

119
00:06:44,322 --> 00:06:46,824
My God, do you think I don't wake up

120
00:06:46,908 --> 00:06:50,286
alone every morning in our bed,

121
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:54,206
praying to God that all of this
was nothing but a bad dream?

122
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:58,753
Iris, I have done everything that I can

123
00:06:58,836 --> 00:07:03,424
to just keep moving forward
since I lost Joe,

124
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:05,468
I did it so that
I could be there for you,

125
00:07:05,551 --> 00:07:07,303
and for Jenna, for this team.

126
00:07:07,386 --> 00:07:10,765
And you come in here and you want
to shove his death in my face?

127
00:07:11,432 --> 00:07:13,768
He was the father of my child!

128
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:15,478
And my father!

129
00:07:24,445 --> 00:07:25,445
Fine.

130
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:30,534
If you insist on pursuing this lie,
then we will save Barry without you.

131
00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:38,834
Fine... You save him your way.
I'll save him mine.

132
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:43,129
[exhales]

133
00:07:58,771 --> 00:08:02,191
Okay, Cecile. What do you want to do?

134
00:08:04,402 --> 00:08:06,654
We find Barry before Despero does first.

135
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,323
No matter what it takes.

136
00:08:15,788 --> 00:08:17,790
[Caitlin] How are we
supposed to find Barry now?

137
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:21,085
Okay. This is gonna sound wild,

138
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:24,463
but Despero's scanning the whole world
for Barry's brainwaves, right?

139
00:08:24,547 --> 00:08:26,549
Like a needle in a haystack.

140
00:08:26,716 --> 00:08:29,802
I know him better than almost anyone.

141
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:33,389
So you should be able to pinpoint
Barry's mind faster than he can.

142
00:08:33,723 --> 00:08:37,935
Only Despero's psychic radius
is exponentially higher than yours.

143
00:08:38,602 --> 00:08:43,190
Alex Danvers says he gets a power boost
from his power source of...

144
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:44,942
...Flame of Py'tar.

145
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:48,487
Okay, I just need
a boost of my own, right?

146
00:08:48,571 --> 00:08:49,989
So you can build something,

147
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:52,491
something that can amplify
my psychic powers.

148
00:08:52,658 --> 00:08:57,246
You want me to build a Cerebro
out of the trash in my garage?

149
00:09:03,711 --> 00:09:05,337
Oh, frack, yeah, I can do that.

150
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:07,006
Okay. There's still one problem.

151
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:10,426
Kalanorians like Despero
have four hemispheres to their brain.

152
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:12,011
The human brain only has two.

153
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:14,805
So even if we amplify
your empathic radius,

154
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:16,766
you'd still be at a disadvantage.

155
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:19,727
Then we're gonna need
some more brain power...

156
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:23,439
and I know just who to call.

157
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:28,569
[Allegra] So, things got
a little intense back there. You okay?

158
00:09:28,903 --> 00:09:31,113
[Iris West] Yeah. Look,
I don't want to hurt Cecile,

159
00:09:31,197 --> 00:09:33,699
but if someone's framing Barry
and my dad might be okay,

160
00:09:33,783 --> 00:09:35,785
then I have to figure out the truth.

161
00:09:36,535 --> 00:09:38,537
I'm just glad
I don't have to do it alone.

162
00:09:39,205 --> 00:09:40,998
Team Citizen forever, boss.

163
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:46,629
So what are we looking for?
Signs of a meta-abduction?

164
00:09:51,217 --> 00:09:52,426
What the hell?

165
00:09:53,469 --> 00:09:54,470
What is it?

166
00:09:58,349 --> 00:09:59,767
I'm not sure. Do you see anything?

167
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:10,653
No, I'm not picking up anything
on the electro-magnetic spectrum,

168
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:13,781
but your time sickness
makes you see stuff sometimes, right?

169
00:10:13,948 --> 00:10:14,949
Could it be acting up?

170
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:16,032
Must be.

171
00:10:16,325 --> 00:10:17,844
Deon's treatments are probably
wearing off.

172
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:19,148
I'm supposed to see him tonight.

173
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:22,123
You know what I did see?

174
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:26,836
The fiber optic aura for these cameras
leads to a security booth inside.

175
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:30,297
So if someone wanted to alter
the footage of Joe's accident,

176
00:10:30,381 --> 00:10:31,608
to make it seem like he died...

177
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:33,050
That'd be where they'd start.

178
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:37,263
I'll never forget that day.

179
00:10:38,097 --> 00:10:40,015
People were screaming, "Someone fell."

180
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:42,841
I tried calling the emergency line,
but it was too late.

181
00:10:43,227 --> 00:10:44,436
What about before it happened?

182
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,438
Did you see anyone suspicious
on the platform?

183
00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:48,858
It was pretty empty when Mr. West died.

184
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:51,402
The Red Line came in 15 minutes early.

185
00:10:52,695 --> 00:10:53,863
Hang on.

186
00:10:54,363 --> 00:10:55,906
Iris West-Allen.

187
00:10:56,907 --> 00:10:57,907
Were you his daughter?

188
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:58,951
I still am.

189
00:11:02,413 --> 00:11:03,622
What about after?

190
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:07,877
Was there anyone there who had access
to the scene before C.C.P.D. arrived?

191
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:09,794
Ma'am...

192
00:11:10,963 --> 00:11:12,131
your father took a bad step.

193
00:11:12,965 --> 00:11:13,965
It happens sometimes.

194
00:11:13,966 --> 00:11:15,802
Well, the reason
I'm asking is because

195
00:11:15,885 --> 00:11:17,761
the video files that you sent over
to C.C.P.D.

196
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:20,525
were missing some very important frames
from the moment of incident.

197
00:11:21,432 --> 00:11:22,808
That doesn't just happen,

198
00:11:22,892 --> 00:11:25,060
unless you're saying
someone got into your system.

199
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:28,063
Or because we're on the same power grid
as Sharks Stadium.

200
00:11:29,023 --> 00:11:31,275
Whenever there's a game,
like there was that day,

201
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:34,528
our automatic CCTV upload
gets interrupted

202
00:11:34,612 --> 00:11:36,447
and we end up losing chunks of data.

203
00:11:37,031 --> 00:11:39,241
It's a good thing
we back up our files locally.

204
00:11:48,042 --> 00:11:50,252
- Is this the only angle?
- No, it's okay.

205
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:53,923
I was wrong. It was just an accident.

206
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:04,299
- [rock music playing in background]
- [balls clanking]

207
00:12:10,773 --> 00:12:14,109
So, who wants next game, boys?

208
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,238
Think you can end up on top?

209
00:12:18,989 --> 00:12:20,549
[Cecile] I think you're done for today.

210
00:12:23,494 --> 00:12:24,536
[sighing]

211
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:30,459
Horton, I'm surprised you showed.

212
00:12:31,669 --> 00:12:34,755
Figured you'd still be crying
over your boyfriend somewhere.

213
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:38,259
You should have heard the cheers at
Iron Heights when that news broke out.

214
00:12:38,968 --> 00:12:41,470
Well, that's funny, because I figured

215
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:45,933
you'd already be running
Scudder's entire criminal enterprise,

216
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:49,561
not hustling morons in a dive bar.

217
00:12:49,937 --> 00:12:52,773
I guess you probably shouldn't
have sold them out after all.

218
00:12:53,941 --> 00:12:54,941
Fine.

219
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:56,067
Aw.

220
00:12:56,944 --> 00:12:58,153
That means you're available.

221
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:02,866
For what? Got a job for me,
Ms. Meta-Attorney?

222
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:06,161
Look, I need help.

223
00:13:07,204 --> 00:13:09,707
Psychic help.
Someone that I care about is missing.

224
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:14,461
Let me guess. He runs real fast.

225
00:13:15,921 --> 00:13:16,921
It's all over the news.

226
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:20,801
Flash went bad.
It's the feel-good story of the year.

227
00:13:21,802 --> 00:13:25,931
And even if I did want to help
return the scarlet speedster

228
00:13:26,015 --> 00:13:27,433
to the side of angels,

229
00:13:27,683 --> 00:13:31,020
during our last go-around,
you messed with my head.

230
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:35,357
I don't know if I can trust you.

231
00:13:37,443 --> 00:13:39,862
Can you trust me to help
get your parole restrictions lifted?

232
00:13:42,531 --> 00:13:43,657
Quid pro quo, huh?

233
00:13:49,705 --> 00:13:50,705
When do we start?

234
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:04,511
Damn it, I can't get this last conduit.

235
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:11,602
You know what? Sometimes,
I like to work with a little music on.

236
00:14:14,229 --> 00:14:15,229
Yeah.

237
00:14:20,152 --> 00:14:22,154
["Blue Monk" playing]

238
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:25,031
Monk?

239
00:14:26,617 --> 00:14:28,285
Okay, trying to impress me.

240
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:31,705
I kind of grew up on this stuff.

241
00:14:33,374 --> 00:14:36,251
Joe always had something
spinning on the turntable.

242
00:14:36,335 --> 00:14:39,213
Miles Davis, Johnny Hartman,
Ella Fitzgerald...

243
00:14:39,797 --> 00:14:40,797
It's his favorite.

244
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:45,552
<i>Was</i> his favorite.

245
00:14:49,515 --> 00:14:52,059
[breathing deeply]

246
00:14:52,518 --> 00:14:54,603
Yeah, I lost someone, too, a while back.

247
00:14:57,022 --> 00:14:58,023
Bill Henderson.

248
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:01,318
Actually, he was a cop,
like your old man.

249
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:03,570
We had our ups and downs,

250
00:15:03,654 --> 00:15:09,118
but... through it all,
he was my best friend... brother.

251
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:17,042
Bill died saving my life...

252
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:21,964
so I could get home
to Lynn and the girls.

253
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,844
Yeah, he made that sacrifice...

254
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:34,184
just like you sacrificing
a big part of yourself here today.

255
00:15:37,646 --> 00:15:38,562
You know, if Joe was here,

256
00:15:38,564 --> 00:15:41,984
I think he'd be real proud
of the hero you've been...

257
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:43,734
all along.

258
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:46,822
It's been you all along, Flash.

259
00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:56,290
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, that was the last conduit.

260
00:15:57,583 --> 00:16:02,045
Now, when your suit materializes, you'll
be able to generate enough voltage

261
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:03,839
to disrupt my Speed Force connection.

262
00:16:06,592 --> 00:16:08,886
All right. Giving Gambi
a run for his money, huh?

263
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:10,721
Well, all right.

264
00:16:12,473 --> 00:16:13,557
Let's go blow this fuse.

265
00:16:16,435 --> 00:16:18,437
[tense music playing]

266
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:30,991
[sighs] I'm ready.

267
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:34,995
This is gonna hurt.

268
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:37,538
Mm-hmm.

269
00:16:42,377 --> 00:16:44,338
[electricity crackling]

270
00:16:53,472 --> 00:16:54,932
[screaming]

271
00:16:59,353 --> 00:17:00,854
[screaming]

272
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:04,525
[groaning]

273
00:17:11,198 --> 00:17:13,075
Boss, you gotta see this.

274
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:16,328
Okay, do you remember
what the security chief said,

275
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:19,540
that the day Joe died,
the Red Line was running early?

276
00:17:19,915 --> 00:17:22,209
Well, back in my car-thief days,

277
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:24,503
I'd take the Red Line home
from the chop shop,

278
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:28,006
and it was never early.
It was always late.

279
00:17:28,507 --> 00:17:31,218
So, my dad was just unlucky?

280
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:33,428
Well, that's an understatement.

281
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:39,017
The train that hit Joe passed a routine
inspection two days before the accident.

282
00:17:39,101 --> 00:17:41,019
Yet, somehow the hydraulics failed?

283
00:17:41,645 --> 00:17:46,066
Iris, there are dozens and dozens
of coincidences like this.

284
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:49,027
Do you know what the odds are
that they all happened at once?

285
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:50,486
A million-to-one.

286
00:17:50,946 --> 00:17:52,781
The events that led to Joe's accident,

287
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:54,741
they line up perfectly.

288
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:56,785
Too perfectly.

289
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,160
So, what are you saying?

290
00:17:58,161 --> 00:18:01,707
That you're right.
That someone was pulling the strings.

291
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:03,542
Barry's not crazy. And your dad...

292
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:04,876
Look, Allegra, I was wrong...

293
00:18:06,795 --> 00:18:08,130
about everything.

294
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:12,985
These last six months have been
the worst six months of my life.

295
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:21,977
Look, I get it.

296
00:18:22,978 --> 00:18:24,062
I do.

297
00:18:25,314 --> 00:18:26,481
When Esperanza died...

298
00:18:28,317 --> 00:18:30,736
I lost hope, too,

299
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:36,825
but... what saved me from the darkness

300
00:18:36,908 --> 00:18:40,037
was remembering the words of a hero.

301
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:43,790
"As long as we keep the loved ones
we've lost in our hearts,

302
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,668
there's always hope."

303
00:18:57,763 --> 00:18:58,805
Are you seeing this?

304
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:00,307
Seeing what?

305
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:04,503
I have to get back to the station.

306
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:06,772
- I thought that was a dead end.
- It's not.

307
00:19:07,606 --> 00:19:09,126
We just couldn't see all the evidence.

308
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:16,281
Ladies, may I present the solution
to all of our Flash-finding problems,

309
00:19:16,782 --> 00:19:18,116
the Neural Conjoiner.

310
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:19,826
Both of you have the natural ability

311
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:21,953
to access brainwaves like an antenna.

312
00:19:22,037 --> 00:19:23,121
Cecile is an empath,

313
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:27,626
and Rosa is a psychic who can spin
people's emotions out of control.

314
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:29,836
So with the telepathic crown
as an amplifier,

315
00:19:30,087 --> 00:19:32,130
we'll be able to conjoin
your psychic powers

316
00:19:32,214 --> 00:19:34,025
and pick up way more brainwaves
than you'd ever be able

317
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:37,135
to pick up on your own,
like, all over the continent.

318
00:19:37,761 --> 00:19:40,347
Now, all you need to do
is focus on the Flash's brainwaves,

319
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,182
and the N.C. will transmit them here,

320
00:19:42,683 --> 00:19:47,104
while I use the visual data
to triangulate his location with this.

321
00:19:47,688 --> 00:19:50,982
I'm sorry, but does that TV
have rabbit ears on it?

322
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:56,238
Yeah. Because it's my grandma's,

323
00:19:56,571 --> 00:19:58,174
which means
we'll have to be done by 7:00,

324
00:19:58,198 --> 00:19:59,958
because she doesn't
want to miss her stories.

325
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,248
You ready?

326
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:18,760
[overlapping mind voices]

327
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,600
[groaning]

328
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:31,565
[panicking] It's too much.
It's too much! It's too much! I can't!

329
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:33,984
- Chuck, turn it off.
- No. We can do this.

330
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:37,653
[gasps]

331
00:20:37,696 --> 00:20:40,157
So many minds to reach and touch.

332
00:20:41,742 --> 00:20:43,822
- [frantically] can't, I can't.
- [breathing heavily]

333
00:20:43,869 --> 00:20:48,623
- It's too many. I can't do this.
- No, there aren't.

334
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:52,669
Horton, listen to me.

335
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:55,922
Together, we are strong enough
to handle this,

336
00:20:56,423 --> 00:21:00,469
but you're letting your own feelings
hold you back. Now, focus!

337
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:02,429
[gasping]

338
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:06,600
Horton! You're letting
your own emotions bring you down.

339
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:09,561
That sadness you got, get over it.

340
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:11,772
- You want to find your hero?
- Yes.

341
00:21:11,855 --> 00:21:13,607
Then, lose the weakness,

342
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:16,359
just like I lost those gushy feelings
for Scudder.

343
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:20,071
Forget about <i>your</i> grief,
<i>your</i> guilt, <i>your</i> sadness.

344
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:23,784
Forget about your damn dead boyfriend.
Bury it!

345
00:21:25,911 --> 00:21:28,038
[breathing heavily]

346
00:21:30,665 --> 00:21:32,667
[overlapping mind voices continue]

347
00:21:43,762 --> 00:21:45,402
[The Flash] <i>I still have
some of my speed.</i>

348
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:47,015
<i>The connections not fully severed.</i>

349
00:21:50,101 --> 00:21:51,101
I found him.

350
00:21:52,938 --> 00:21:54,564
Keep it going. Keep it going.

351
00:21:54,773 --> 00:21:56,107
We almost have a clear signal.

352
00:21:57,526 --> 00:21:58,610
[both groan]

353
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:04,157
- What happened?
- You overloaded the crown.

354
00:22:05,784 --> 00:22:08,370
Damn, Horton. I knew I was good, but...

355
00:22:09,287 --> 00:22:10,330
color me impressed.

356
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:16,169
Okay, if the amplifier's busted, then
maybe we should try a different way.

357
00:22:16,253 --> 00:22:19,172
No, Chester, you can fix it, right?
You can fix it.

358
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:22,008
Well, I need about an hour
to recalibrate,

359
00:22:22,092 --> 00:22:23,444
but then, we should be good to go.

360
00:22:23,468 --> 00:22:26,680
Do it. We finally made some progress.
We're not gonna stop now.

361
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:28,223
[Human Despero] <i>Those humans.</i>

362
00:22:29,683 --> 00:22:32,936
<i>Their emotions blind them to reason
yet give them power.</i>

363
00:22:34,104 --> 00:22:36,189
<i>They'll find Flash first.</i>

364
00:22:37,607 --> 00:22:39,401
And I'll be right behind them.

365
00:22:58,879 --> 00:23:00,881
You forget we had
an appointment in the books

366
00:23:00,964 --> 00:23:03,258
'cause, usually,
we meet in the Speed Lab.

367
00:23:04,134 --> 00:23:06,928
Then again, I am a force god. So...

368
00:23:08,096 --> 00:23:10,557
I can work with this, too.
Ready for your treatment?

369
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:14,185
I didn't forget we had an appointment.
I wanted you to find me here.

370
00:23:14,936 --> 00:23:15,937
Why?

371
00:23:20,442 --> 00:23:21,818
This is where your dad died.

372
00:23:23,945 --> 00:23:26,823
I can sense him walking
through here, six months ago.

373
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:29,784
I came here earlier today

374
00:23:30,619 --> 00:23:33,538
and I saw these particles
near the tracks where my dad fell.

375
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:37,249
And then I saw them again when I was
going through evidence from his death.

376
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:40,295
This is a sign that there's
something wrong with my dad's death.

377
00:23:41,296 --> 00:23:42,881
Proof that someone is...

378
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:46,176
altering reality
and leaving particles behind.

379
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:49,721
But nobody's screwed with the timeline,
or I would've sensed that.

380
00:23:49,804 --> 00:23:51,264
Then, someone's hiding something.

381
00:23:51,556 --> 00:23:54,559
I need you to undo my treatments,
all of them.

382
00:23:54,643 --> 00:23:57,354
- You can't be serious.
- Deon, please.

383
00:23:58,063 --> 00:24:01,232
Whatever's happening,
its connected to these particles.

384
00:24:01,608 --> 00:24:04,903
If I absorb all of that
temporal matter out of you,

385
00:24:04,986 --> 00:24:07,530
and that sickness you got
starts spreading too fast,

386
00:24:07,948 --> 00:24:11,034
you're gonna start moving
in and out of timelines again.

387
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,012
- Or worse.
- I'm not afraid of that.

388
00:24:13,036 --> 00:24:14,037
Well, I am.

389
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,916
Look, if there's a chance that I can
save my husband and bring my dad back,

390
00:24:18,917 --> 00:24:19,917
I'll risk it.

391
00:24:33,056 --> 00:24:34,432
My God, what are they?

392
00:24:37,852 --> 00:24:39,104
[Deon] Temporal isotopes.

393
00:24:41,064 --> 00:24:43,483
They're decaying instead of growing.

394
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:48,029
That's why I couldn't sense them before.

395
00:24:50,573 --> 00:24:51,616
Oh, damn.

396
00:24:54,911 --> 00:24:59,332
Someone tapped into the Negative
Still Force to rewrite the timeline.

397
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:04,170
Your dad wasn't supposed to die.

398
00:25:05,422 --> 00:25:07,799
But someone changed the past
to make sure that he did.

399
00:25:11,302 --> 00:25:13,142
[Caitlin] Cecile, we need to talk
about Dillon.

400
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:15,557
Look, I know. I get it, okay?

401
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:20,228
Dillon can be a little intense,
but we're trying to beat Despero here.

402
00:25:21,104 --> 00:25:22,772
She wants you to forget about Joe.

403
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:25,191
It's more than a little intense.

404
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:31,406
And... honestly, it's not the first time

405
00:25:31,489 --> 00:25:33,241
I've seen you repress your feelings.

406
00:25:34,868 --> 00:25:37,037
You have no idea
what it's been like for me. None.

407
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,540
Actually, I do, because
it's what I went through with Ronnie.

408
00:25:44,669 --> 00:25:46,671
After the particle accelerator exploded,

409
00:25:47,464 --> 00:25:52,218
I was so traumatized by his death
that even thinking about him

410
00:25:52,302 --> 00:25:53,720
would send me spiraling.

411
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:58,767
Rather than facing my grief,

412
00:25:59,642 --> 00:26:03,063
I started fearing it. I just...

413
00:26:05,315 --> 00:26:07,525
I can't help thinking
you're heading down the same path.

414
00:26:09,277 --> 00:26:12,947
Okay, no. I know I don't talk about Joe.

415
00:26:15,784 --> 00:26:17,118
It's because I think about him

416
00:26:17,827 --> 00:26:22,749
every second of every hour of every day.

417
00:26:24,459 --> 00:26:27,253
And it's not just my grief
that I have to feel,

418
00:26:27,337 --> 00:26:31,257
Caitlin. Barry,
and Iris and little Jenna...

419
00:26:31,925 --> 00:26:37,055
because of my powers, whenever they're
near me, I feel all of their grief, too.

420
00:26:39,724 --> 00:26:41,392
It's everything that I can do

421
00:26:41,476 --> 00:26:44,479
to push it all down just so that
I can keep moving forward,

422
00:26:44,562 --> 00:26:47,524
because if I don't, I will drown...

423
00:26:48,733 --> 00:26:50,652
and that cannot happen again.

424
00:26:50,735 --> 00:26:54,656
I know it's hard,
but your strength as an empath,

425
00:26:56,366 --> 00:26:58,868
it doesn't come
from burying your emotions.

426
00:26:59,786 --> 00:27:01,955
It comes from feeling the feelings...

427
00:27:04,666 --> 00:27:05,959
even the hard ones.

428
00:27:10,672 --> 00:27:12,715
- [beeping]
- Let me guess. Dinner's ready.

429
00:27:13,216 --> 00:27:14,384
Oh!

430
00:27:14,509 --> 00:27:16,344
Sweet Joseph Winters. Okay.

431
00:27:16,553 --> 00:27:19,556
My phone is still plugged into
the S.T.A.R. Labs emergency sensors.

432
00:27:20,431 --> 00:27:22,725
Someone just turned on
the particle accelerator.

433
00:27:27,939 --> 00:27:30,441
- [alarm sounding]
- What the hell's going on?

434
00:27:30,525 --> 00:27:31,860
The power's spiking, sir.

435
00:27:32,235 --> 00:27:33,236
Impossible.

436
00:27:33,862 --> 00:27:36,197
It's like the particle accelerator
turned itself on.

437
00:27:36,281 --> 00:27:37,401
[Human Despero] Not exactly.

438
00:27:39,701 --> 00:27:41,703
I may have given it a little push.

439
00:27:50,712 --> 00:27:51,713
[agent] Susan?

440
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:53,839
[grunts]

441
00:27:57,302 --> 00:27:58,761
Susan, what in the world...

442
00:28:01,306 --> 00:28:02,222
Checkmate.

443
00:28:02,223 --> 00:28:03,343
- [bone cracking]
- [gagging]

444
00:28:04,225 --> 00:28:05,268
[man groans]

445
00:28:11,232 --> 00:28:12,901
[electrical buzzing]

446
00:28:14,903 --> 00:28:16,529
And with this power...

447
00:28:17,155 --> 00:28:20,241
no mind will shut its doors on me!

448
00:28:21,075 --> 00:28:22,785
[manic yelling]

449
00:28:29,417 --> 00:28:31,961
Why would Despero
turn on the particle accelerator?

450
00:28:32,045 --> 00:28:34,464
He's into alternative energy. Who cares?

451
00:28:34,547 --> 00:28:37,258
Guys, look, she is right.
We need to do this.

452
00:28:38,676 --> 00:28:39,676
Okay.

453
00:28:44,724 --> 00:28:46,226
Remember what we did last time.

454
00:28:47,101 --> 00:28:48,645
Remember that power.

455
00:28:50,104 --> 00:28:51,439
[overlapping mind voices]

456
00:28:56,653 --> 00:28:57,653
Come on.

457
00:28:58,321 --> 00:28:59,364
Where are you?

458
00:29:05,954 --> 00:29:06,954
I can see Flash.

459
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:10,208
He's with Jefferson Pierce.
Where are they?

460
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:11,708
Let me try and find out.

461
00:29:11,709 --> 00:29:14,421
I can feel your grief again, Horton.
I told you to bury it.

462
00:29:14,879 --> 00:29:16,547
Cecile, you don't have to listen to her.

463
00:29:16,631 --> 00:29:18,675
You know your powers
better than she does.

464
00:29:20,885 --> 00:29:21,885
Hell yes.

465
00:29:22,512 --> 00:29:25,723
It's like meta-juicing,
only ten times better.

466
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,356
[Cecile gasps]

467
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:36,150
You should be proud of the power
you displayed here.

468
00:29:37,151 --> 00:29:38,151
Now...

469
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,989
open your minds to me...

470
00:29:41,364 --> 00:29:43,032
and show me the Flash.

471
00:29:43,116 --> 00:29:44,158
Leave us alone.

472
00:29:45,201 --> 00:29:47,328
Guys... Who are they talking to?

473
00:29:47,412 --> 00:29:48,913
Despero. He must be here.

474
00:29:54,877 --> 00:29:55,962
Dillon, what are you doing?

475
00:29:56,212 --> 00:29:57,380
Causing a little vertigo.

476
00:29:58,047 --> 00:29:59,924
It's an oldie but a goodie.

477
00:30:08,224 --> 00:30:09,267
Okay, big boy.

478
00:30:09,726 --> 00:30:11,102
How about a little quid pro quo?

479
00:30:11,728 --> 00:30:15,356
I let you inside my mind,
show you where the Flash is...

480
00:30:16,316 --> 00:30:19,110
and then you and I go kill him together.

481
00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:22,322
What makes you think
I came here to bargain?

482
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:26,950
Okay.

483
00:30:27,785 --> 00:30:31,539
How about I let you peek inside my mind
for free and we'll call it even?

484
00:30:33,416 --> 00:30:35,126
[groans and screams]

485
00:30:37,337 --> 00:30:38,337
Dillon!

486
00:30:44,344 --> 00:30:45,344
[Cecile] Dillon!

487
00:30:48,931 --> 00:30:50,099
I can't feel her anymore.

488
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:53,561
- What did you do?
- I looked inside her mind,

489
00:30:54,312 --> 00:30:57,357
but I could only partly reconstruct
the Flash's location.

490
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,818
The other half must be in yours.

491
00:31:02,862 --> 00:31:03,946
Don't be afraid.

492
00:31:04,489 --> 00:31:05,615
It's a necessity.

493
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,950
I am trying to save the world.

494
00:31:08,034 --> 00:31:09,952
By killing us? And Barry?

495
00:31:10,244 --> 00:31:12,205
A few lives to spare billions.

496
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:16,000
That's the trade I'm willing to make,
but one that you won't even stomach.

497
00:31:17,418 --> 00:31:19,962
Your mind's strong for a human empath,

498
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:23,132
but it's kindling
compared to the Flame of Py'tar.

499
00:31:28,471 --> 00:31:30,181
[screaming]

500
00:31:32,183 --> 00:31:34,977
Stop fighting me
and show me where he is.

501
00:31:36,145 --> 00:31:40,358
You have no allies left,
you're weak and you're alone.

502
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:47,030
You're wrong.

503
00:31:47,782 --> 00:31:48,991
I am not alone.

504
00:31:55,623 --> 00:31:56,624
[gasps]

505
00:31:58,084 --> 00:31:59,084
[groans softly]

506
00:32:00,253 --> 00:32:01,253
Hey.

507
00:32:01,379 --> 00:32:03,631
- [Cecile] Hey, you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

508
00:32:06,092 --> 00:32:07,427
She's alive, but barely.

509
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:09,554
Despero, he attacked us.

510
00:32:10,346 --> 00:32:11,472
How did you survive?

511
00:32:13,558 --> 00:32:14,600
I thought about Joe.

512
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,395
[device beeps]

513
00:32:18,312 --> 00:32:19,814
Hey, wait, wait, wait. I found Barry.

514
00:32:21,732 --> 00:32:22,775
He's at the Hall.

515
00:32:23,067 --> 00:32:24,694
- [whispers] What?
- [Cecile] Guys, guys,

516
00:32:24,819 --> 00:32:26,320
Despero was in my head.

517
00:32:27,405 --> 00:32:29,198
That means he knows where Barry is, too.

518
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:36,210
- [electricity crackling]
- [The Flash screams]

519
00:32:39,459 --> 00:32:40,853
[Black Lightning] All right,
maybe we should take a break.

520
00:32:40,877 --> 00:32:43,171
No, we have to finish
before Despero finds me.

521
00:32:43,671 --> 00:32:45,465
Who the hell is Despero?

522
00:32:47,467 --> 00:32:48,467
[sighs]

523
00:32:50,344 --> 00:32:52,638
If you're keeping something important
from me,

524
00:32:53,973 --> 00:32:55,349
I suggest you remedy it.

525
00:32:57,602 --> 00:32:58,603
He's from the future.

526
00:33:01,105 --> 00:33:02,773
He says that ten years from now,

527
00:33:03,941 --> 00:33:05,485
I'm going to destroy the world.

528
00:33:06,777 --> 00:33:07,777
You believe him?

529
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:12,241
Do you remember what we said
when we first met during Crisis?

530
00:33:12,992 --> 00:33:13,993
We're not quitters.

531
00:33:14,702 --> 00:33:16,996
You can change your future,
just like you did back then...

532
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:18,289
That's what I'm trying to do.

533
00:33:18,581 --> 00:33:21,876
If I get rid of my speed, I can
keep Despero's future from happening.

534
00:33:22,335 --> 00:33:24,837
What will this Despero do if you don't?

535
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,840
He's going to kill me.

536
00:33:30,051 --> 00:33:31,528
You didn't think that was important
to mention?

537
00:33:31,552 --> 00:33:33,638
I knew if I told you,
you'd want to go after Despero,

538
00:33:33,721 --> 00:33:35,973
but I need you to follow
the Injustice Protocols.

539
00:33:36,974 --> 00:33:39,560
I'm not acting out of fear,
I'm trying to do the right thing.

540
00:33:39,644 --> 00:33:42,204
Yeah, I thought I was too, but I wasn't,
and you weren't, either.

541
00:33:42,396 --> 00:33:43,397
You're just...

542
00:33:43,814 --> 00:33:46,526
afraid of becoming this man
that Despero says you are.

543
00:33:46,609 --> 00:33:47,944
I've already hurt people!

544
00:33:48,194 --> 00:33:51,656
- I'm already a liability!
- No, what you are is a hero.

545
00:33:52,323 --> 00:33:53,533
Doesn't that mean something?

546
00:33:54,617 --> 00:33:56,369
I've seen what happens.

547
00:33:57,245 --> 00:33:59,497
What I end up doing.
It's going to happen.

548
00:33:59,872 --> 00:34:02,375
Getting rid of my speed
is the only way to save the world.

549
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:03,374
[yells] Damn it, Jefferson,

550
00:34:03,376 --> 00:34:05,294
it's the only way
to save your family, too!

551
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:10,508
I suggest you keep my family
out of this.

552
00:34:10,591 --> 00:34:11,951
After everything we've done today,

553
00:34:12,009 --> 00:34:13,889
everything I've told you,
you're just giving up.

554
00:34:15,555 --> 00:34:16,597
[Black Lightning] Barry...

555
00:34:17,848 --> 00:34:20,560
you need to think
very carefully right now.

556
00:34:20,643 --> 00:34:23,771
I'm asking you to save
the world and you won't even listen!

557
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:32,196
You're gonna hear me now...

558
00:34:33,197 --> 00:34:35,757
'cause one way or the other,
you're going to help me finish this.

559
00:34:49,422 --> 00:34:50,862
[The Flash] Look at what I just did!

560
00:34:51,424 --> 00:34:52,883
The damage I can still cause.

561
00:34:53,884 --> 00:34:56,804
You made a promise to keep
this world safe.

562
00:34:59,515 --> 00:35:01,315
[Black Lightning]
I am keeping the world safe!

563
00:35:01,517 --> 00:35:03,102
By saving one of its protectors!

564
00:35:13,237 --> 00:35:15,823
Fine. You wanna ignore the protocols?

565
00:35:16,198 --> 00:35:17,658
Now imagine millions dead...

566
00:35:18,242 --> 00:35:19,493
all because of me!

567
00:35:32,965 --> 00:35:35,301
It's your lightning, you keep it.

568
00:35:35,384 --> 00:35:36,384
[groans]

569
00:35:38,054 --> 00:35:41,891
How about we stop this insanity? Huh?

570
00:35:47,021 --> 00:35:49,607
You remember why we call
our safety plan "Injustice"?

571
00:35:51,233 --> 00:35:52,568
Because if one of us goes rogue,

572
00:35:53,778 --> 00:35:55,655
the rest of the world
doesn't stand a chance.

573
00:35:56,572 --> 00:35:58,616
[electricity crackling]

574
00:36:04,372 --> 00:36:05,539
[glass breaking]

575
00:36:16,759 --> 00:36:18,302
[breathing heavily]

576
00:36:20,137 --> 00:36:21,137
[sighs wearily]

577
00:36:30,856 --> 00:36:32,376
[Black Lightning] You think this is...

578
00:36:32,942 --> 00:36:34,110
what he would have wanted?

579
00:36:35,069 --> 00:36:36,069
[Black Lightning groans]

580
00:36:37,697 --> 00:36:41,617
You told me that before... Crisis,
Oliver went to the Monitor,

581
00:36:42,827 --> 00:36:44,161
to trade his life for yours.

582
00:36:46,664 --> 00:36:48,958
Now, I never met the man,
so you tell me.

583
00:36:49,709 --> 00:36:50,751
Why'd he do that?

584
00:36:52,461 --> 00:36:53,629
Because he was afraid?

585
00:36:55,965 --> 00:36:56,965
No.

586
00:36:58,008 --> 00:36:59,176
A man like him...

587
00:36:59,885 --> 00:37:02,221
lays down his life for a man like you...

588
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,306
for one reason.

589
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,351
Because you are the best of us.

590
00:37:10,062 --> 00:37:12,148
Oliver Queen wasn't a quitter.

591
00:37:13,232 --> 00:37:14,775
He'd never quit on you.

592
00:37:16,402 --> 00:37:18,988
So don't you <i>dare</i> quit on yourself.

593
00:37:23,701 --> 00:37:25,411
Jefferson, I'm so sorry.

594
00:37:29,415 --> 00:37:30,415
It's okay.

595
00:37:34,003 --> 00:37:35,087
Just tell me this.

596
00:37:40,384 --> 00:37:41,384
Where's the future?

597
00:37:41,844 --> 00:37:42,844
[subdued laugh]

598
00:37:46,015 --> 00:37:47,015
It's right here.

599
00:37:48,267 --> 00:37:49,310
Whose life is this?

600
00:37:51,896 --> 00:37:52,896
Mine.

601
00:37:54,523 --> 00:37:55,843
So what are you gonna do with it?

602
00:37:58,903 --> 00:37:59,904
Live it...

603
00:38:01,155 --> 00:38:02,573
by any means necessary.

604
00:38:08,204 --> 00:38:09,204
[grunts]

605
00:38:10,247 --> 00:38:11,916
[both grunting]

606
00:38:12,124 --> 00:38:13,417
I told you, Flash.

607
00:38:13,626 --> 00:38:16,086
If I found any trace
of your true nature,

608
00:38:17,546 --> 00:38:19,632
I'd end your existence.

609
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,302
Leave him alone. He's innocent.

610
00:38:23,844 --> 00:38:26,764
Someone changed the timeline to kill
my father and make Barry seem insane.

611
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,600
You really believe
you're telling the truth.

612
00:38:34,104 --> 00:38:35,189
How tragic.

613
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:41,695
[screaming]

614
00:38:43,823 --> 00:38:44,949
Hurry, I'll hold him off.

615
00:38:46,534 --> 00:38:47,993
[groans]

616
00:38:51,163 --> 00:38:53,403
You need to go and figure out
who is trying to frame you.

617
00:38:54,792 --> 00:38:55,918
I need to go to the future,

618
00:38:56,001 --> 00:38:57,753
to see who really causes Armageddon.

619
00:38:59,755 --> 00:39:00,915
I can't hold him much longer.

620
00:39:00,965 --> 00:39:03,717
I'm not gonna make it there.
I don't have enough Speed Force left.

621
00:39:03,801 --> 00:39:05,261
How about some Still Force?

622
00:39:07,721 --> 00:39:10,558
My isotopes will pull you
toward any weird temporal activity.

623
00:39:12,935 --> 00:39:14,270
Run, Barry! Run!

624
00:39:23,404 --> 00:39:25,322
You all just killed this world.

625
00:39:48,512 --> 00:39:50,556
[intense music playing]

626
00:40:14,622 --> 00:40:17,291
[Eobard] If I could have
everyone's attention for a moment.

627
00:40:18,918 --> 00:40:22,004
I have been waiting
for this moment for a very,

628
00:40:22,838 --> 00:40:23,923
very long time.

629
00:40:24,757 --> 00:40:25,883
When you find...

630
00:40:26,717 --> 00:40:27,968
...the love of your life,

631
00:40:28,302 --> 00:40:30,346
it's like electricity

632
00:40:31,013 --> 00:40:32,431
pulsing through your veins,

633
00:40:32,556 --> 00:40:36,060
giving you a shock that you absolutely
never want to end.

634
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,561
Because...

635
00:40:38,979 --> 00:40:40,230
because now...

636
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:46,153
now you're a part of something greater.

637
00:40:46,612 --> 00:40:47,905
A part of something wonderful,

638
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,118
and frankly, surprising,

639
00:40:53,202 --> 00:40:54,912
because <i>you</i> never know...

640
00:40:57,164 --> 00:40:59,625
what face fate will be wearing

641
00:41:00,084 --> 00:41:05,255
when she shows up to knock on your door
and change your life... forever.

642
00:41:05,756 --> 00:41:08,050
But when it does,
for you, my wish is that,

643
00:41:08,133 --> 00:41:09,176
that face...

644
00:41:11,136 --> 00:41:14,682
is as beautiful as the one
standing next to me. To Iris West...

645
00:41:16,642 --> 00:41:17,726
the love of my life.

646
00:41:20,604 --> 00:41:22,064
And to our future together.

647
00:41:35,494 --> 00:41:37,037
What the hell is he doing here?
