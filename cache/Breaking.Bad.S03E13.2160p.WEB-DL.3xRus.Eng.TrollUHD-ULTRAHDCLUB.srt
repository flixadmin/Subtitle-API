1
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:46,964
- Well, hello again.
- Hi, I hope we're not too late.

2
00:00:47,173 --> 00:00:48,773
- No, no. Perfect timing.
- Okay.

3
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:50,968
- Stan, this is my husband, Walt.
- Hi.

4
00:00:51,177 --> 00:00:53,095
- Good to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

5
00:00:53,304 --> 00:00:55,389
- Sandia Laboratories, huh?
- Yeah.

6
00:00:55,598 --> 00:00:58,100
I hear some fascinating stuff
goes on out there.

7
00:00:58,309 --> 00:00:59,894
Yeah, well, you know.

8
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:02,188
Working on anything you can talk about?

9
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:05,232
I'm picturing giant space lasers.
Am I right?

10
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:08,235
Honestly, what I do
would bore you senseless.

11
00:01:08,444 --> 00:01:13,115
Giant space lasers? That sounds cool. I'll
bring it up at our next staff meeting.

12
00:01:13,324 --> 00:01:16,494
- Well, just remember I get a cut.
- All right. It's a deal.

13
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:19,747
So this is it, honey. What do you say?
Wanna take a tour?

14
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:21,957
- Sure.
- Okay.

15
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:26,003
Look, how about
I give ya'll some privacy?

16
00:01:26,212 --> 00:01:30,758
I'll go out to the car, make a few calls.
Take as much time as you need.

17
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,719
- All right.
- Okay, thanks.

18
00:01:36,472 --> 00:01:38,933
- He's a nice guy. He doesn't push.
- Yeah.

19
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:43,771
So as you can see,
there's this kind of flow going on here.

20
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,829
- It's a nice big living room.
- Yeah.

21
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:49,777
And this is the dining area.

22
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:54,323
- Oh, the dining area. Right.
- Yes. Oh, and

23
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:56,409
it's got a pool.

24
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:59,286
Pool is nice.

25
00:01:59,495 --> 00:02:02,248
Backyard could be a little bigger.

26
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:07,461
And... Oh, there's a breakfast bar
kind of dealie here, which is nice.

27
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:10,589
And, I don't know,
the kitchen's really spacious,

28
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:13,634
and, you know, got good appliances and...

29
00:02:13,843 --> 00:02:15,553
How many bedrooms?

30
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:17,638
Three. Told you.

31
00:02:17,847 --> 00:02:21,934
They're all pretty good size and...
Oh, this is the first one here.

32
00:02:22,143 --> 00:02:24,562
And then there's two more at the back.

33
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,689
Only three bedrooms?

34
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:29,650
We're gonna need at least five,
don't you think?

35
00:02:29,859 --> 00:02:31,318
- Five?
- Yeah.

36
00:02:31,527 --> 00:02:34,196
What, do I look like
I'm about to drop a litter?

37
00:02:34,405 --> 00:02:39,785
No, no, no.
We'll have three kids total, eventually.

38
00:02:39,994 --> 00:02:42,496
Yeah, but we'll need
a spare room for a study,

39
00:02:42,705 --> 00:02:45,875
so that I can work at home
and you can write.

40
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:50,880
Yeah, no.
I don't think this is gonna be enough.

41
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:55,009
Okay, what about a wine cellar?

42
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:59,013
I mean, we certainly cannot be
expected to live without a wine cellar.

43
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:03,184
Very funny. I just think we need
to set our sights high is all.

44
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:08,355
- At least, higher than here.
- Walt, this is a good neighborhood.

45
00:03:08,564 --> 00:03:11,692
It's got a good elementary
and a very good high school,

46
00:03:11,901 --> 00:03:16,864
and believe me, because I have
definitely looked everywhere.

47
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:19,742
For our price range,
this is as good as it gets.

48
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,912
Well, then let's stretch our price range.

49
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,830
Truly. I mean, why...?

50
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:29,210
Why buy a starter house when we'll
have to move out in a year or two?

51
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:31,712
Did you win the lottery and not tell me?

52
00:03:31,921 --> 00:03:33,714
I'm serious.

53
00:03:33,923 --> 00:03:37,384
Come on. Why be cautious?

54
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:40,471
We've got nowhere to go but up.

55
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:57,024
- Yeah.
<i>- Walter, you see us?</i>

56
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:58,776
Yeah. I see you.

57
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:03,864
{\an8}<i>I'd like you to exit your vehicle
and start walking toward us.</i>

58
00:06:04,073 --> 00:06:07,993
And then what?
I'm gonna need some...

59
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:11,246
Some kind of assurance.

60
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,375
<i>I assure you,
I could kill you from way over here</i>

61
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:17,294
<i>if it makes you feel any better.</i>

62
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:15,144
Walter, you've been busy.

63
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:19,148
You wanna put your arms out
to your sides for me, if you would?

64
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:37,916
{\an8}You know I haven't slept since Thursday?

65
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:41,086
{\an8}I was out all night
cleaning up after you.

66
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:43,130
{\an8}I need my sleep.

67
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:47,301
{\an8}You said no half measures.

68
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:53,182
{\an8}Yeah. Funny how words can be so open
to interpretation.

69
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:57,311
- You get your car fixed?
- Not yet.

70
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,813
You're gonna wanna get your car fixed.

71
00:08:00,022 --> 00:08:02,983
Let's see how this goes first.

72
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:39,853
Has your condition worsened?

73
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:42,815
- Excuse me?
- Your medical condition.

74
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,943
- Has it grown worse?
- Not that I know of, no.

75
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:48,695
Is there a ringing in your ears?

76
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:51,448
Are you seeing bright lights
or hearing voices?

77
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:57,371
{\an8}- I'm quite well, thank you.
- No. Clearly, you are not.

78
00:08:57,579 --> 00:09:00,958
{\an8}No rational person would do
as you have done.

79
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:05,045
Explain yourself.

80
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:11,009
{\an8}My partner was about to get himself shot.

81
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:12,678
{\an8}I intervened.

82
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,305
{\an8}Some worthless junkie.

83
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:18,559
For him, you intervene
and put us all at risk.

84
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:22,563
{\an8}Some contemptible junkie who couldn't
keep the peace for eight hours.

85
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:25,232
{\an8}That's right. He couldn't.

86
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,901
He was angry
because those dealers of yours

87
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,237
had just murdered an 11-year-old boy.

88
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:32,281
I heard about it.

89
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:35,242
He should have let me take care of them.

90
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,244
Maybe.

91
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:41,582
Then again, maybe he thought
it was you who gave the order.

92
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:50,132
Are you asking me
if I ordered the murder of a child?

93
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:54,428
I would never ask you that.

94
00:10:00,142 --> 00:10:01,852
Where is Pinkman now?

95
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:06,106
I wouldn't know.

96
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:09,818
Couple of time zones away, at least.

97
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,322
Beyond that, I'd only be guessing.

98
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:17,951
He has enough money to last forever,
he knows he needs to keep moving.

99
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,745
You'll never find him.

100
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,830
I don't know, Walt

101
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:25,250
it's what I do, after all.

102
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:29,171
He's out of the picture.

103
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:33,467
I saved his life, I owed him that,
but now he and I are done.

104
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:36,845
Which is exactly what you wanted,
isn't it?

105
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:44,811
You've always struck me
as a very pragmatic man.

106
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:48,482
So if I may,
I would like to review options with you.

107
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:52,569
Of which, it seems to me, you have two.

108
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,780
Option A:

109
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:56,823
You kill me right here and now.

110
00:10:57,199 --> 00:10:59,868
Apparently,
I have made that very easy for you.

111
00:11:00,077 --> 00:11:02,663
You can kill me, no witnesses,

112
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:06,667
and then spend the next few weeks
or months

113
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,711
tracking down Jesse Pinkman
and you kill him too.

114
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:14,299
A pointless exercise, it seems to me,
but that is option A.

115
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:16,134
What is option B?

116
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:17,719
I continue cooking.

117
00:11:18,387 --> 00:11:20,722
You and I both forget about Pinkman.

118
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:23,183
We forget this ever happened.

119
00:11:23,392 --> 00:11:26,019
We consider this a lone hiccup

120
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:31,066
in an otherwise long
and fruitful business arrangement.

121
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:35,237
I prefer option B.

122
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:44,079
You'd need a new assistant.

123
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,416
- I could get right on that.
- No.

124
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:49,918
This time, I choose.

125
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:07,728
Your car

126
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:09,563
get it fixed.

127
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:11,398
Yeah.

128
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:52,647
Really?

129
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:21,718
It's good to see you.

130
00:13:23,512 --> 00:13:25,180
Thanks.

131
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:28,433
It's good to be back.

132
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:31,269
Well, shall we?

133
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:35,482
By all means, Gale, let's cook.

134
00:13:44,909 --> 00:13:48,037
What about that rhinoceros?
You think he'd make a good pet?

135
00:13:48,246 --> 00:13:49,872
- No.
- No?

136
00:13:50,081 --> 00:13:52,708
Don't you think if you called,
he'd come running?

137
00:13:52,917 --> 00:13:55,920
I bet he would.
I bet he'd come running:

138
00:13:56,754 --> 00:13:57,922
You're silly, Pop-Pop.

139
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:01,175
Well, a little. But he'd probably
knock everything over.

140
00:14:01,384 --> 00:14:05,930
- Plus, there's that big nose of his.
- That's not a nose, that's a horn.

141
00:14:06,138 --> 00:14:10,393
- Is that so?
- His real nose is little.

142
00:14:11,435 --> 00:14:14,897
I learn all kinds of things
being with you.

143
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:20,069
Okay, June bug, these are for you.

144
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:22,572
- What about the rest?
- The rest are for me.

145
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:25,283
No, they're not.
You're too old for balloons.

146
00:14:26,951 --> 00:14:30,955
You're never too old for balloons.
Give me a hug.

147
00:14:31,163 --> 00:14:33,374
I see your mama.
Don't keep her waiting.

148
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:36,043
- Bye, Pop-Pop.
- Bye, baby.

149
00:14:36,252 --> 00:14:39,422
Hi, sweetie.
Did you have fun with Pop-Pop?

150
00:16:41,794 --> 00:16:44,922
Please. Please, no.

151
00:18:02,792 --> 00:18:05,461
Chow, you have anything
you wanna tell me?

152
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:08,422
Thank God you're here.
They keep me prisoner.

153
00:18:08,631 --> 00:18:12,468
- They keep you prisoner.
- I don't do nothing for them ever.

154
00:18:12,676 --> 00:18:15,805
They try and make me. I say, no.

155
00:18:16,013 --> 00:18:21,143
They steal my chemicals.
I can't stop them. I am businessman.

156
00:18:21,352 --> 00:18:23,813
You're a business... The lady out front...

157
00:18:24,021 --> 00:18:27,650
Hey, lady, are you still there?
Ask her if she's still there.

158
00:18:42,498 --> 00:18:43,958
She says, yes.

159
00:18:45,376 --> 00:18:48,796
How's her driving? Driving.
Is she good behind the wheel?

160
00:18:49,004 --> 00:18:51,465
Good. She's good driver.

161
00:18:51,674 --> 00:18:54,301
Licensed? Dependable?

162
00:18:54,552 --> 00:18:55,886
She has a Camry.

163
00:18:56,595 --> 00:18:57,680
Good.

164
00:19:01,892 --> 00:19:04,687
The trucks will be here
first thing in the morning.

165
00:19:04,895 --> 00:19:08,691
I strongly recommend
that you return our calls next time.

166
00:19:08,899 --> 00:19:11,068
So have her drive you to the hospital.

167
00:19:15,239 --> 00:19:18,367
She's gonna need her shoe.

168
00:19:28,836 --> 00:19:32,047
- Where'd they cross?
- Laredo, looks like.

169
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:34,884
They didn't exactly send their A players.

170
00:19:35,092 --> 00:19:38,095
But like you said, it's cartel, all right.

171
00:19:40,222 --> 00:19:42,266
Probing for weakness.

172
00:19:43,601 --> 00:19:46,061
Well, they didn't find any.

173
00:19:49,148 --> 00:19:50,941
What about Pinkman?

174
00:19:51,734 --> 00:19:54,403
I'm making inquiries.

175
00:20:10,294 --> 00:20:14,089
Yeah, that's two.
All right, let's close it up.

176
00:20:21,931 --> 00:20:23,474
All right, bring it down.

177
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:26,268
You ready?

178
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:33,025
Okay, we're good.

179
00:20:38,489 --> 00:20:41,158
You can take your mask off now.

180
00:20:51,168 --> 00:20:53,128
Does that guy ever leave?

181
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:59,009
When exactly did that start?

182
00:20:59,468 --> 00:21:01,428
It's new.

183
00:21:01,804 --> 00:21:04,056
We had a...

184
00:21:05,015 --> 00:21:08,852
We had a little drama
with the person you replaced.

185
00:21:09,353 --> 00:21:12,273
- Sorry to hear that.
- No, it'll be fine.

186
00:21:12,481 --> 00:21:15,693
Things will continue to smooth out and...

187
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:18,237
Yeah, it'll be fine.

188
00:21:20,656 --> 00:21:25,244
By the way, if you're at all worried
about working with me...

189
00:21:25,452 --> 00:21:27,371
No, I'm not.

190
00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:29,540
Whatever my shortcomings last time

191
00:21:29,748 --> 00:21:33,002
I intend for things to go perfectly
from here on out.

192
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:36,839
- So if there is...?
- Gale, you're great.

193
00:21:37,047 --> 00:21:39,675
- Seriously.
- I just...

194
00:21:39,883 --> 00:21:45,014
However you like things to be done
is exactly how we're gonna do them.

195
00:21:45,222 --> 00:21:47,057
Period.

196
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:50,769
From here on out, so...

197
00:21:52,896 --> 00:21:54,481
Please, teach me.

198
00:22:01,071 --> 00:22:02,865
Okay.

199
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,074
Gale. It's good to see you.

200
00:23:27,282 --> 00:23:28,908
Mr. Fring.

201
00:23:29,118 --> 00:23:30,744
Wow, this is...

202
00:23:30,953 --> 00:23:34,248
I should have called.
I'm not interrupting anything, am I?

203
00:23:34,957 --> 00:23:38,460
No. No, no, not at all.
Please, come in.

204
00:23:40,462 --> 00:23:42,881
Can I offer you something?
A crème de menthe?

205
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:45,801
No. No, thank you.

206
00:23:46,343 --> 00:23:48,429
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

207
00:23:48,637 --> 00:23:52,850
Oh, no, no. It's no inconvenience.

208
00:23:54,268 --> 00:23:56,854
I need to talk to you about something.

209
00:23:57,187 --> 00:23:59,481
Something rather pressing.

210
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:06,363
If push came to shove, I was wondering

211
00:24:06,572 --> 00:24:10,451
how soon you might be able
to take over the lab yourself.

212
00:24:10,659 --> 00:24:12,828
You and an assistant.

213
00:24:13,495 --> 00:24:15,289
Why would...?

214
00:24:16,498 --> 00:24:20,627
- Why would push come to shove?
- Has Walter ever talked to you

215
00:24:20,836 --> 00:24:24,506
about why he got into
this particular line of work?

216
00:24:26,341 --> 00:24:28,968
I guess I assumed
it was because it pays so well.

217
00:24:29,178 --> 00:24:31,805
It is, but specifically

218
00:24:32,014 --> 00:24:35,017
has he ever spoken to you
about his health problems?

219
00:24:37,853 --> 00:24:42,107
I'm not surprised.
He's a very private person.

220
00:24:42,524 --> 00:24:45,527
What exactly are his health problems?

221
00:24:45,736 --> 00:24:48,030
He's dying of cancer.

222
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:53,494
It is why he does this, to provide for
his family, which he's accomplished.

223
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:57,873
They will never want for anything,
he's seen to that.

224
00:25:02,252 --> 00:25:03,629
How long does he have?

225
00:25:05,214 --> 00:25:07,883
That is very much the question.

226
00:25:08,258 --> 00:25:12,429
He does not wanna talk about it.
And every time I bring it up with him...

227
00:25:13,889 --> 00:25:19,186
I don't know that he's fully accepted
the reality of it.

228
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:24,149
And not to sound cold-blooded,
but I am running a business here.

229
00:25:24,733 --> 00:25:29,321
- No, I understand.
- I have a very large investment in this.

230
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:32,658
There's so much overhead
that I can't afford to shut down.

231
00:25:32,866 --> 00:25:34,201
Not even for a week.

232
00:25:34,409 --> 00:25:37,829
So you understand my concern.

233
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:41,040
And my desire for continuity.

234
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:42,709
I do. Absolutely.

235
00:25:42,918 --> 00:25:47,089
Now, I intend to keep Walter on
as long as he wants

236
00:25:47,297 --> 00:25:51,218
assuming that he's physically up to it.

237
00:25:51,426 --> 00:25:57,099
But as he cannot or will not tell me
how long that might be

238
00:25:57,307 --> 00:26:02,229
I must prepare
for the worst-case scenario.

239
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:05,482
Well, worst-case scenario...

240
00:26:11,947 --> 00:26:14,783
I suppose if we had

241
00:26:15,409 --> 00:26:18,203
at least a few more cooks together.

242
00:26:18,412 --> 00:26:21,582
You don't think you're ready now?

243
00:26:21,915 --> 00:26:23,917
Well, I mean

244
00:26:24,126 --> 00:26:26,628
he is such a...

245
00:26:27,796 --> 00:26:29,006
A master.

246
00:26:29,965 --> 00:26:32,467
There's always more for me to learn.

247
00:26:34,636 --> 00:26:39,433
But I'm thinking that if we had

248
00:26:39,641 --> 00:26:41,435
say

249
00:26:42,019 --> 00:26:43,854
one or two more cooks.

250
00:26:48,817 --> 00:26:50,736
One more

251
00:26:51,361 --> 00:26:53,780
I guess would do it. I suppose.

252
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:57,451
I believe in you, Gale.

253
00:26:59,036 --> 00:27:03,165
I know that when the time comes,
you will be ready.

254
00:27:17,554 --> 00:27:18,847
What's up?

255
00:27:25,979 --> 00:27:28,148
Walt, is there...?

256
00:27:33,528 --> 00:27:37,698
Any particular trick
to purging the catalyst bed?

257
00:27:39,993 --> 00:27:44,705
No, it's pretty straightforward.
I'll show you when we get there.

258
00:28:10,565 --> 00:28:12,317
Yeah?

259
00:28:12,692 --> 00:28:14,735
Tell him I'm in conference.

260
00:28:22,743 --> 00:28:25,914
- I'm in conference.
- I'm looking to find a client of yours.

261
00:28:26,122 --> 00:28:28,875
I was hoping you could help me out
with an address.

262
00:28:29,084 --> 00:28:32,254
- Which client?
- Jesse Pinkman.

263
00:28:32,837 --> 00:28:35,507
Jesse-Pinkman-in-the-phone-book
Jesse Pinkman.

264
00:28:35,715 --> 00:28:39,261
How would one track him down, I wonder.

265
00:28:42,264 --> 00:28:45,267
- You're still here.
- I need your full attention, Saul.

266
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:47,560
Jesse Pinkman.
Current whereabouts.

267
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:51,439
The sooner you tell me, the sooner
you get back to whatever this is.

268
00:28:51,648 --> 00:28:54,901
What am I, an 8th-grade hall monitor?
Current whereabouts.

269
00:28:55,110 --> 00:29:00,282
- Let me tell you something, Mike, you...
- Whoa, you are good right there.

270
00:29:00,657 --> 00:29:03,618
Now, let's both get comfortable.

271
00:29:07,414 --> 00:29:09,708
Now, when I say, I'm looking for Pinkman

272
00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:12,210
we both know why, don't we?

273
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:17,882
You pretending otherwise only wastes
my time and serves to annoy me.

274
00:29:18,133 --> 00:29:19,467
Look, Mike

275
00:29:19,676 --> 00:29:22,429
there are rules to this lawyer thing.

276
00:29:22,637 --> 00:29:24,681
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

277
00:29:24,889 --> 00:29:27,225
Attorney-client privilege.
That's a big one.

278
00:29:27,434 --> 00:29:29,561
That's something I provide for you.

279
00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:31,604
So if I give up Pinkman

280
00:29:31,813 --> 00:29:35,275
then you're gonna be asking,
"Saul gives them up pretty easy.

281
00:29:35,483 --> 00:29:37,986
"What's to keep him
from giving me up?" You see?

282
00:29:38,194 --> 00:29:40,155
So then, where's the trust?

283
00:29:41,114 --> 00:29:44,826
I trust the hole in the desert
I'd leave you in.

284
00:29:46,328 --> 00:29:49,497
Yeah, that's an argument.

285
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:51,666
Saul

286
00:29:51,958 --> 00:29:56,129
don't make me beat you
till your legs don't work.

287
00:29:56,504 --> 00:30:00,633
Now tell me where to find him.
You know it's the right thing.

288
00:30:05,305 --> 00:30:09,184
I can't tell you, Mike, all right? I...

289
00:30:10,185 --> 00:30:15,315
Look, if I was to tell you, well,
I just... I couldn't live with myself.

290
00:30:15,523 --> 00:30:17,192
I'm sorry.

291
00:30:19,527 --> 00:30:23,156
But who's to say I didn't write
the address down in my day planner?

292
00:30:23,365 --> 00:30:26,868
Or on a scratch piece of paper somewhere?

293
00:30:27,369 --> 00:30:29,954
Who's to say
I didn't write down a location

294
00:30:30,163 --> 00:30:33,500
strictly for my own professional use?

295
00:30:35,043 --> 00:30:38,755
Do not touch anything on my desk.

296
00:30:38,963 --> 00:30:42,967
I'm gonna leave the room,
make myself a Nescafé.

297
00:30:59,734 --> 00:31:03,905
I'm just looking out for you, that's all.
Like a mother hen.

298
00:31:04,906 --> 00:31:09,244
Money-laundering ain't what it used
to be. God, do I miss the '80s.

299
00:31:09,744 --> 00:31:13,665
You're wasting your time.
I'm buying the car wash, end of story.

300
00:31:13,873 --> 00:31:17,627
Well, one look at this place,
you're gonna fall in love, so...

301
00:31:33,893 --> 00:31:38,189
Was I right? Where else you gonna find
a cash-only business that's this fun?

302
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:43,403
Unless we're talking massage parlors,
and, I don't see it. Shall we?

303
00:31:50,827 --> 00:31:53,621
You ever actually play laser tag?

304
00:31:54,164 --> 00:31:57,917
You know, it's good cardio.
Plus, you get to shoot at kids.

305
00:32:06,634 --> 00:32:09,345
You got your bumper cars over there
down that way.

306
00:32:09,554 --> 00:32:12,140
Got your arcade here,
all the latest video games.

307
00:32:12,348 --> 00:32:16,352
Snack bar's there. Nothing stopping
you from selling beer to the parents.

308
00:32:16,561 --> 00:32:21,691
- That's a whole new revenue stream...
- All right, already. We're good.

309
00:32:22,984 --> 00:32:24,569
Holy Christ.

310
00:32:24,777 --> 00:32:27,780
We're good? This constitutes good
where you're from?

311
00:32:27,989 --> 00:32:30,783
- My car is bugged?
- I said, maybe. Maybe bugged.

312
00:32:30,992 --> 00:32:34,162
I'm being followed?
What the hell have you gotten me into?

313
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:38,249
My own PI is threatening to break
my legs. That's like Thomas Magnum

314
00:32:38,458 --> 00:32:41,628
threatening that little prissy guy
with the mustache.

315
00:32:41,836 --> 00:32:45,131
Over and above.
Service-wise, this is over and above.

316
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:47,300
You and I survive this

317
00:32:47,509 --> 00:32:49,969
I'm seriously rethinking
my pricing, yeah.

318
00:32:50,178 --> 00:32:53,348
And that goes double for you, Hip-Hop.

319
00:32:53,681 --> 00:32:55,350
Okay, my guy's no dummy, right?

320
00:32:55,558 --> 00:32:59,896
I give us maybe 24 hours before he
figures out that address goes nowhere.

321
00:33:00,104 --> 00:33:02,774
You guys do your thing, make it snappy.

322
00:33:02,982 --> 00:33:06,361
I'll go see if they have "Tetris"
or something.

323
00:33:13,868 --> 00:33:16,120
So how you holding up?

324
00:33:18,915 --> 00:33:20,625
You?

325
00:33:21,209 --> 00:33:23,127
I got my old job back.

326
00:33:23,336 --> 00:33:26,631
At least until they kill me
and Gale takes over.

327
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:31,469
- So he's their boy, huh?
- He's their boy.

328
00:33:31,678 --> 00:33:34,055
How long you think you've got?

329
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:39,352
Well, he asks a lot of questions
about the cooking process.

330
00:33:39,561 --> 00:33:43,690
I try to be as vague as possible,
but I got that guy Victor watching me

331
00:33:43,898 --> 00:33:46,526
listening to every word I say.

332
00:33:47,068 --> 00:33:51,990
You know, maybe that the only thing
saving me is Gale's fastidiousness.

333
00:33:52,198 --> 00:33:57,161
And once he feels confident
that he knows my entire method...

334
00:34:02,667 --> 00:34:04,586
So, what do we do?

335
00:34:08,381 --> 00:34:10,592
You know what we do.

336
00:34:18,891 --> 00:34:21,769
There's got to be some other way.

337
00:34:23,396 --> 00:34:27,066
Maybe it's better for you
to just go to the cops.

338
00:34:27,275 --> 00:34:32,488
All right? I mean,
I can't believe I'm saying that and all,

339
00:34:32,697 --> 00:34:34,616
but for your family.

340
00:34:34,824 --> 00:34:38,911
The DEA would love you,
all the shit you could tell them.

341
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:42,081
Federal witness protection,
that's a good deal.

342
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:47,295
As for me, I'll hit the road, yo.
I mean, I'll make it.

343
00:34:48,796 --> 00:34:51,966
We had a good run.

344
00:34:53,092 --> 00:34:55,136
But it's over.

345
00:34:57,930 --> 00:35:00,350
Never the DEA.

346
00:35:02,769 --> 00:35:04,479
The cook can't stop.

347
00:35:04,687 --> 00:35:08,983
That's the one thing I'm certain of,
production cannot stop.

348
00:35:09,192 --> 00:35:11,486
Gus can't afford to.

349
00:35:11,861 --> 00:35:15,198
So if I'm the only chemist that he's got

350
00:35:16,574 --> 00:35:19,661
then I've got leverage,
and leverage keeps me alive.

351
00:35:19,869 --> 00:35:23,289
It keeps you alive too.
I think I can see to that.

352
00:35:24,666 --> 00:35:29,003
If I'm the only chemist that he's got.

353
00:35:36,886 --> 00:35:42,517
I can't do it, Mr. White.

354
00:35:43,935 --> 00:35:46,104
Like you said, I'm...

355
00:35:47,105 --> 00:35:49,232
I'm not a...

356
00:35:50,733 --> 00:35:52,860
I can't do it.

357
00:35:58,574 --> 00:36:00,410
I'll do it.

358
00:36:03,121 --> 00:36:06,541
I'm gonna need your help.

359
00:36:06,749 --> 00:36:08,918
I mean,
they're watching me day and night.

360
00:36:09,127 --> 00:36:12,380
They never leave me alone with Gale,
not for a moment.

361
00:36:12,588 --> 00:36:15,216
Hell, I don't even know
where the man lives.

362
00:36:15,758 --> 00:36:19,137
He's not in the phone book,
I can't find him on the Internet,

363
00:36:19,345 --> 00:36:23,099
and I can't do it in the lab,
Victor's always there.

364
00:36:24,934 --> 00:36:27,145
But if I could just

365
00:36:27,478 --> 00:36:30,273
shake Victor, for even an hour one night

366
00:36:30,481 --> 00:36:32,942
I think then that...

367
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:35,737
I may be able...

368
00:36:38,656 --> 00:36:41,117
to make it look like an accident.

369
00:36:43,453 --> 00:36:46,664
There's got to be some other way.

370
00:36:47,582 --> 00:36:49,751
I'm all ears.

371
00:36:50,084 --> 00:36:54,797
But when it comes down to you and me
versus him, I'm sorry.

372
00:36:55,298 --> 00:36:57,592
I'm truly sorry,

373
00:36:58,509 --> 00:37:00,803
but it's gonna be him.

374
00:37:01,804 --> 00:37:05,433
Now, you are the only edge that I've got

375
00:37:05,641 --> 00:37:08,561
as long as they don't know
that you're in town.

376
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:12,106
But I need you to track him,
get me his address.

377
00:37:12,315 --> 00:37:14,484
And I'll do the rest.

378
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:25,161
Look, I saved your life, Jesse.

379
00:37:29,707 --> 00:37:32,126
Are you gonna save mine?

380
00:38:44,531 --> 00:38:45,658
<i>Yeah?</i>

381
00:38:45,866 --> 00:38:47,534
Please, tell me you found him.

382
00:38:47,743 --> 00:38:53,415
<i>6353 Juan Tabo Boulevard.
Apartment 6.</i>

383
00:38:56,585 --> 00:38:59,421
<i>- You there?</i>
- Yeah.

384
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:03,926
6353 Juan Tabo. Number 6. Got it.

385
00:39:06,512 --> 00:39:09,765
- He's home?
<i>- Yep.</i>

386
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:12,226
Anyone watching the place?

387
00:39:12,434 --> 00:39:16,021
<i>No. Looks pretty much wide-open.</i>

388
00:39:16,438 --> 00:39:18,440
<i>When are you gonna do it?</i>

389
00:39:22,653 --> 00:39:24,405
Tonight.

390
00:39:24,613 --> 00:39:26,782
Once it gets dark.

391
00:39:29,827 --> 00:39:33,080
<i>Don't do this, Mr. White.</i>

392
00:39:33,289 --> 00:39:37,459
<i>Please. Go to the cops.</i>

393
00:40:09,325 --> 00:40:10,659
We got a problem.

394
00:40:10,868 --> 00:40:13,620
Some kind of chemical leaking
in your lab.

395
00:40:13,829 --> 00:40:15,497
Better come with me.

396
00:40:19,001 --> 00:40:20,961
I'll follow you.

397
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:25,299
They tell me to bring you, I bring you.
Come on, get in the car.

398
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:33,367
I don't know if it's a barrel leak,

399
00:41:33,575 --> 00:41:36,870
but you got something
mighty stinky down there.

400
00:41:40,416 --> 00:41:42,543
After you.

401
00:41:44,545 --> 00:41:49,925
Walter, the sooner you figure out what
this is, the sooner we all go home.

402
00:41:54,471 --> 00:41:56,723
Please, don't do this.

403
00:41:56,974 --> 00:41:58,934
Mike

404
00:41:59,226 --> 00:42:01,728
you don't have to do this.

405
00:42:02,896 --> 00:42:05,858
Yeah, unfortunately, I do, Walter.

406
00:42:06,066 --> 00:42:07,609
Downstairs.

407
00:42:07,818 --> 00:42:12,072
I'll cook. I'll cook for free. There won't
be any more trouble, I promise you.

408
00:42:12,281 --> 00:42:13,907
- No.
- If I could talk to Gus...

409
00:42:14,116 --> 00:42:15,993
- No.
- ...I can make him understand.

410
00:42:16,201 --> 00:42:18,495
If I could talk to Gus,
I can convince him.

411
00:42:18,704 --> 00:42:20,539
Just let me, please... Please.

412
00:42:20,747 --> 00:42:24,501
- Please, let me talk to him.
- Shut up! Shut up.

413
00:42:25,752 --> 00:42:29,506
I can't do it. I'm sorry.

414
00:42:32,843 --> 00:42:34,761
I'll give you Jesse Pinkman.

415
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:38,432
Like you said, he's the problem.
He's always been the problem.

416
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:42,394
And without him, we would...
And he's in town, all right?

417
00:42:42,603 --> 00:42:45,272
He's not in Virginia
or wherever you're looking.

418
00:42:45,481 --> 00:42:48,775
He's right here in Albuquerque
and I could take you to him.

419
00:42:48,984 --> 00:42:51,320
I'll take you right to him.

420
00:42:54,323 --> 00:42:55,949
- What do you say?
- Where is he?

421
00:42:56,158 --> 00:43:00,120
- Right now, you give me an address.
- I don't... He moves. He moves around.

422
00:43:00,329 --> 00:43:03,081
But if you let me call him...
No, no, please.

423
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:05,959
No, I just... My phone. I'll just...

424
00:43:06,168 --> 00:43:10,297
It's just my phone. I'll call him
and I'll have him meet me.

425
00:43:10,506 --> 00:43:12,633
All right? Okay?

426
00:43:12,841 --> 00:43:14,510
Okay?

427
00:43:54,091 --> 00:43:55,300
Did you do it?

428
00:43:58,053 --> 00:43:59,888
<i>Mr. White?</i>

429
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:02,224
<i>Did you do it?</i>

430
00:44:02,849 --> 00:44:04,726
No, I didn't do it.

431
00:44:05,185 --> 00:44:07,729
<i>I can't now.</i>

432
00:44:08,564 --> 00:44:12,025
<i>- It's gonna have to be you.</i>
- What? No way, man.

433
00:44:12,234 --> 00:44:15,362
You're closer than we are.
You'll have a 20-minute lead.

434
00:44:15,571 --> 00:44:18,198
<i>They've got me, they're going to kill me.</i>

435
00:44:18,407 --> 00:44:20,617
- Jesse, do it now! Do it!
- Son of a bitch!

436
00:44:20,826 --> 00:44:22,077
<i>Do it, Jesse! Do it!</i>

437
00:44:30,752 --> 00:44:33,005
Just what the hell was that exactly?

438
00:44:33,213 --> 00:44:34,923
You might wanna hold off.

439
00:44:35,132 --> 00:44:36,592
Yeah?

440
00:44:36,925 --> 00:44:40,721
- Why?
- Because your boss is gonna need me.

441
00:44:41,597 --> 00:44:47,561
6353 Juan Tabo, Apartment 6.

442
00:44:50,981 --> 00:44:52,149
Yeah.

443
00:45:38,528 --> 00:45:41,155
Hi. How can I help you?

444
00:45:47,788 --> 00:45:49,998
Take whatever you want.

445
00:45:51,208 --> 00:45:53,585
I have money. I have...

446
00:45:53,794 --> 00:45:56,421
I got a lot of money.

447
00:45:56,713 --> 00:45:59,007
I have...

448
00:46:06,431 --> 00:46:09,726
Please, don't do this.

449
00:46:11,311 --> 00:46:13,522
You don't... You...

450
00:46:15,816 --> 00:46:20,194
You... You don't have to do this.
