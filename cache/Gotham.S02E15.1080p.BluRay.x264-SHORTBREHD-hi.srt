(STUTTERS) Bit of a mess. (CHUCKLES)

326
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:50,362
I was just passing by and...

327
00:17:51,822 --> 00:17:53,323
May I...

328
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:55,075
Could I come in for a moment?

Uh, it's... It's so good to see you.

331
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:05,169
(SIGHS) So, how have you been, old friend?
Well, I hope.

332
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:06,545
Yeah, well.

333
00:18:06,712 --> 00:18:08,714
I have been. Been busy.
I've been really busy.

334
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:11,049
And what about you?
I hear that you've been released.

335

Oh, oh. (CHUCKLES)

337
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:18,515
Well, just good old Butch
and Tabitha having fun. (CHUCKLES)

338
00:18:18,682 --> 00:18:20,225
They talked about killing me,

339
00:18:21,602 --> 00:18:23,645
so this was actually pretty nice
of them, considering. (CHUCKLES)

340

They did a pretty good job
on you in Arkham, huh?

342
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:32,112
I'm here to tell you, Ed, as a friend,

343
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:34,656
violence and anger are not the answer.

344
00:18:34,823 --> 00:18:36,325
I am a changed man.

Better, and you can change, too.

And I'm really grateful
for all that you've taught me,

352
00:18:52,758 --> 00:18:56,220
and that bad stuff you told me
about Jim Gordon is really paying off.

- Is it?
<i>- It is.</i>

355
00:18:58,889 --> 00:19:00,307
It's helped me to create
the perfect puzzle

356
00:19:00,474 --> 00:19:01,892
to get rid of my Jim Gordon dilemma.

Thanks for coming by.

362
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:28,293
So, I spoke with my gal in IA.

363
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,671
The snitch said
Penguin was beating Galavan to death

364
00:19:30,838 --> 00:19:34,049
when you stepped in
and put a bullet in his chest.

365
00:19:39,638 --> 00:19:41,348
Someone else was there that night.

366
00:19:43,267 --> 00:19:45,060
Either that, or Penguin talked.

367
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:46,270
He did just get out of Arkham.

368
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:48,355
How the hell he did, I'll never know.

369
00:19:48,522 --> 00:19:50,607
But lest we forget he was in there

370
00:19:50,774 --> 00:19:52,317
for a murder you committed.

371
00:19:53,569 --> 00:19:55,404
A grudge is not beyond
the realm of possibility.

372
00:19:55,571 --> 00:19:56,947
He could have talked when he was arrested.

373
00:19:57,114 --> 00:19:59,157
Used it to cut a deal, but he didn't.

374
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:03,328
Did your IA contact
give you anything else?

375
00:20:03,495 --> 00:20:05,664
The witness has agreed
to swear out a statement.

376
00:20:05,831 --> 00:20:08,333
IA has officially
reopened the investigation.

377
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,377
You are now the primary suspect

378
00:20:10,961 --> 00:20:13,589
in the murder of Theo Galavan.

379
00:20:20,137 --> 00:20:22,264
Well, tell my uncle to call me!

380
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,269
Look, I know you think
he's got a soft spot for you,

381
00:20:27,436 --> 00:20:30,689
but I'm pretty sure that's gonna change
when he finds out you tried to rob him.

382
00:20:31,106 --> 00:20:33,525
My guess is he's not gonna be
too happy with you, either,

383
00:20:34,443 --> 00:20:38,155
when I tell him that I just waltzed
in here and grabbed the cash.

384
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:42,576
So, maybe you let us go,
and we call it even?

385
00:20:44,328 --> 00:20:45,913
What kind of message would that send?

386
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:49,666
No. The Gilzeans
are all about consequences.

No, he's right. You know,

Hello, Officer Pinkney.

488
00:26:03,897 --> 00:26:05,774
I'm so sorry to bother you at home.
Can I come in?

489
00:26:06,816 --> 00:26:08,735
Uh, sure.

Hey, Pinkney,

496
00:26:21,331 --> 00:26:23,083
what do you call a tavern of blackbirds?

497
00:26:24,209 --> 00:26:26,795
- A crowbar. (CHUCKLES)

I know it's kind of lame.

500

I just came up with it on the spot.

Gertrude came to work
as a cook for my parents.

507
00:27:16,469 --> 00:27:18,263
She was so young and beautiful.

508
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,265
So full of life.

509
00:27:21,766 --> 00:27:22,892
So beautiful.

510
00:27:26,229 --> 00:27:27,856
I was young then, too.

511
00:27:28,273 --> 00:27:29,399
A boy, really.

512
00:27:31,318 --> 00:27:33,570
A foolish, romantic boy.

513
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:42,579
When my parents found out,

514
00:27:43,705 --> 00:27:46,082
they forbade us from being together.

515
00:27:46,249 --> 00:27:48,501
I was the heir to a great fortune,
they said.

516
00:27:48,668 --> 00:27:50,211
And she was just a cook.

517
00:27:51,421 --> 00:27:52,672
I threatened to run away with her.

518
00:27:53,548 --> 00:27:57,927
Turn my back on my family name
and my inheritance.

519
00:27:58,094 --> 00:28:01,056
It was the first and only time
I ever stood up to them.

<i>They must have known
my words were just that.</i>

521

<i>The next day, Gertrude was gone.</i>

523
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:15,820
My parents told me only that
they had come to an arrangement.

524
00:28:15,987 --> 00:28:17,447
She would be taken care of,

525
00:28:17,614 --> 00:28:21,284
and I must never make
an attempt to find her.

526
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,288
And to my shame, I didn't.

527
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:29,793
I let them separate us.

528
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,795
I had no idea...

529
00:28:32,921 --> 00:28:34,672
She never told me she was pregnant.

530
00:28:36,966 --> 00:28:38,468
She didn't tell me about you...

531

If she did...

532
00:28:41,888 --> 00:28:44,974
She told me that my father had died
when I was still a baby.

533
00:28:46,851 --> 00:28:48,895
Easier than the truth, I suppose.

534
00:28:49,604 --> 00:28:53,316
That your father was a coward
who wouldn't stand up to his parents.

535
00:28:53,483 --> 00:28:57,904
She must have figured that the two of you
would be better off making your own way.

536
00:29:00,448 --> 00:29:02,409
Which, in fact, is probably the truth.

537
00:29:04,285 --> 00:29:05,453
Look at you.

538

She did a good job, didn't she?

540
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:15,296
She tried.

Because he was the anonymous witness

We found this Internal Affairs form
at Pinkney's place.

It's the exact same statement
that the anonymous witness made,

with his own name.

No.

646
00:36:13,005 --> 00:36:14,549
Maybe you went over to his place
to talk him out of it?

647
00:36:14,715 --> 00:36:16,050
I told you,
I didn't know it was his place!

You know me.

650
00:36:21,889 --> 00:36:24,475
I know that something went down
between you and Galavan that night.

651
00:36:24,642 --> 00:36:27,061
I saw it in your eyes
when IA was grilling you.

652
00:36:27,228 --> 00:36:30,481
And now, the one person who was about
to shine light on this whole thing

653
00:36:30,648 --> 00:36:33,484
is found beaten to death
with you standing over the body.

- What am I missing?
- I was set up!

00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:40,783
Jim, how many lying,
son-of-a-bitch, low-life weasels

00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:42,493
have you heard use that same line?

Somebody set you up?

658
00:36:43,911 --> 00:36:45,621
That's what you're going with?

659
00:36:47,665 --> 00:36:50,334
The least you can do
is admit what you did.

660
00:36:50,501 --> 00:36:51,711
Be a man.

661
00:36:53,379 --> 00:36:54,422
Pinkney was one of us.

662
00:36:54,922 --> 00:36:57,383
He deserves that. I deserve that!

663
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:59,051
The least you could do
is look me in the eye

664
00:36:59,552 --> 00:37:02,263
and remind me that
you were a good cop once.

665
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:05,725
That you still know right from wrong. Jim!
