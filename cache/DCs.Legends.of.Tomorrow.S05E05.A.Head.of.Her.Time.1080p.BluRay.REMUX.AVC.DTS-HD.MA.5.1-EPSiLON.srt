00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:03,481
<i>Previously on</i>
Legends of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:03,505 --> 00:00:05,215
Mick frigging Rory.
Ali, remember?

3
00:00:05,382 --> 00:00:06,982
<i>She wasn't just some girl,
was she?</i>

4
00:00:07,301 --> 00:00:10,012
Remember when we dented history?
Your sister is the dent.

5
00:00:10,095 --> 00:00:12,139
<i>Maybe her being here,
she'll remember who she was.</i>

6
00:00:12,222 --> 00:00:13,491
How did you jailbreak
your way out of here?

7
00:00:13,515 --> 00:00:15,517
<i>I was poking around your screens,</i>

8
00:00:15,601 --> 00:00:18,145
<i>and suddenly,
I knew how to hack my way out.</i>

9
00:00:18,228 --> 00:00:21,607
Astra and this whole
bloody mess is on me.

10
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:23,734
She could continue
releasing souls indefinitely.

11
00:00:23,817 --> 00:00:25,194
What happened here, John?

12
00:00:25,277 --> 00:00:26,862
That witch is Astra's dead mother.

13
00:00:26,945 --> 00:00:27,946
She's through there.

14
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:30,390
<i>Her spirit is waiting
on the other side of that door, and...</i>

15
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:32,075
<i>none too happy with me.</i>

16
00:00:45,214 --> 00:00:47,132
John?

17
00:00:47,216 --> 00:00:49,426
Blimey, he's really
cocked it up this time.

18
00:00:50,344 --> 00:00:51,704
How could you let him go in there?

19
00:00:52,346 --> 00:00:53,889
That thing is hurting him.

20
00:00:53,972 --> 00:00:56,266
Then he probably deserves it.

21
00:00:56,391 --> 00:00:59,019
I can't just stand here.

22
00:00:59,102 --> 00:01:01,021
Being an apprentice means
never having to say,

23
00:01:01,104 --> 00:01:04,066
"Sorry, I let you get killed
by a poltergeist."

24
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:06,526
Get your filthy paws
off of me!

25
00:01:09,738 --> 00:01:11,531
No. No, no, no, no, no.

26
00:01:11,615 --> 00:01:12,866
Move out of the way.

27
00:01:13,617 --> 00:01:14,844
Are you sure you know what you're doing?

28
00:01:14,868 --> 00:01:16,161
Yes.

29
00:01:17,037 --> 00:01:18,038
Maybe.

30
00:01:48,026 --> 00:01:49,278
Oh, my God.

31
00:01:53,365 --> 00:01:54,365
John?

32
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,517
Oh, Gary.

33
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,060
What have you done?

34
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,708
Sorry. Old Assassin habits die hard.

35
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:47,377
Babe. Now that you've given me
a heart attack,

36
00:02:47,461 --> 00:02:49,880
I was just about to jump in.
Care to join me?

37
00:02:50,005 --> 00:02:53,759
Whoa, co-showering in
the communal bathroom.

38
00:02:53,842 --> 00:02:55,177
You are getting comfy.

39
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:59,765
Which is a good thing because
I'm gonna need you to woman the ship.

40
00:02:59,848 --> 00:03:01,308
I've got business in Star City.

41
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:02,910
Is everything okay?

42
00:03:02,934 --> 00:03:04,662
Yeah, it's just some stuff
I need to take care of,

43
00:03:04,686 --> 00:03:09,024
but it might take a few days,
which is why I need an interim captain.

44
00:03:10,442 --> 00:03:11,442
- Captain?
- Mmm-hmm.

45
00:03:12,027 --> 00:03:13,028
No, no, no, no, no.

46
00:03:13,111 --> 00:03:15,111
I was just starting to find my footing
as a Legend.

47
00:03:15,155 --> 00:03:16,531
Nobody likes the boss, babe.

48
00:03:16,948 --> 00:03:18,158
Well, they like me.

49
00:03:18,241 --> 00:03:20,035
Yeah, because you're cool Captain Lance.

50
00:03:20,118 --> 00:03:22,537
I'm just a button-pusher
in a boring pantsuit.

51
00:03:22,621 --> 00:03:26,416
No, babe, just have fun with it.
They are going to love you.

52
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,126
- No. No, no, no.
- Yes.

53
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,878
I miss you already, Captain Pantsuit.

54
00:03:29,961 --> 00:03:31,838
No, babe. I'm not...

55
00:03:41,932 --> 00:03:43,308
Raise you two.

56
00:03:44,267 --> 00:03:46,436
Make it ten.

57
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,439
Finally. A real hand.

58
00:03:52,609 --> 00:03:55,570
- She folds.
- Like hell I do.

59
00:03:55,695 --> 00:03:57,989
Like Hell you do.

60
00:04:00,909 --> 00:04:02,369
What the hell are you doing?

61
00:04:02,452 --> 00:04:05,163
Keeping us in the black.
You lost another account.

62
00:04:05,247 --> 00:04:06,915
First Rasputin, then Bugsy...

63
00:04:06,998 --> 00:04:09,626
- John Constantine...
- Now, Meyers.

64
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:12,546
Your little resurrection venture
is getting too risky.

65
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:15,966
You turn the tide,
or you'll lose everything.

66
00:04:17,175 --> 00:04:19,052
I've played nice long enough.

67
00:04:19,803 --> 00:04:22,472
Now, it's time to play naughty.

68
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:31,648
That's one angry ghost.

69
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:35,068
Yeah, but now,
she's loose in the bloody house.

70
00:04:35,152 --> 00:04:37,352
- What, that was Astra's mum?
- And her name is Natalie.

71
00:04:37,404 --> 00:04:39,906
What did you do to her, John boy?

72
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:43,785
That was a long time ago.
She was walking home late from work,

73
00:04:43,869 --> 00:04:46,913
and some drunken idiot
blew a red light and...

74
00:04:48,957 --> 00:04:50,834
Her husband Alex begged me
to bring her back.

75
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,963
- You never told me that.
- Yeah, well, I never told anyone.

76
00:04:55,881 --> 00:04:57,841
Now, let's just say that

77
00:04:57,924 --> 00:05:00,469
that night in Newcastle
when we lost Astra,

78
00:05:00,552 --> 00:05:03,430
it was a little more complicated
than an exorcism.

79
00:05:07,184 --> 00:05:09,519
Something tells me
that you're not telling the truth.

80
00:05:09,603 --> 00:05:11,122
Look, I'm trying to fix it, Nat,
all right?

81
00:05:11,146 --> 00:05:13,231
I'm trying to save Astra! Now, help me!

82
00:05:17,777 --> 00:05:19,737
Doesn't seem to be
the answer she was looking for.

83
00:05:19,779 --> 00:05:23,116
The demon that I summoned
brought Natalie back.

84
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,178
But if you brought her back,
why... why is she a ghost?

85
00:05:25,202 --> 00:05:27,746
Because I botched it, all right?

86
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:29,709
I thought I had him under control,
but I didn't.

87
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:33,627
- You can't have her!
- John, get me out of here!

88
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,003
<i>He took Astra.</i>

89
00:05:35,795 --> 00:05:36,981
Natalie couldn't live with herself

90
00:05:37,005 --> 00:05:40,050
knowing that the price of her life
was her daughter's.

91
00:05:40,133 --> 00:05:42,260
She killed herself in this room.

92
00:05:42,969 --> 00:05:44,262
That's so sad!

93
00:05:51,645 --> 00:05:54,898
Doesn't look like Natalie's done
with you yet, John-o.

94
00:06:01,905 --> 00:06:05,367
No, it looks like Natalie wants to
take me on a trip down memory lane.

95
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:13,542
All righty-tighty, then. You ready
for the official <i>Waverider</i> tour?

96
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:15,377
- Hmm.
- What would you like to see first?

97
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,128
What do you people do
around here for fun?

98
00:06:17,212 --> 00:06:18,797
If you could just follow me this way.

99
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,757
First stop, the galley.

100
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,218
Gideon can whip up any kind of food
you can imagine.

101
00:06:23,301 --> 00:06:25,470
Last week, Nate and I
made cheddar biscuits

102
00:06:25,554 --> 00:06:27,764
and had her fabricate
some squeezable butter.

103
00:06:27,847 --> 00:06:31,059
That tasty treat has been
off the shelf since 2024.

104
00:06:31,142 --> 00:06:32,227
She can make anything,

105
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:34,396
and you went
with a discontinued condiment.

106
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,482
- Wait. Can she make clothes?
- Of course.

107
00:06:38,358 --> 00:06:41,653
Okay, tell the computer I need a dress
for my perfume launch tonight.

108
00:06:41,736 --> 00:06:43,613
- We'll be back in time for that, right?
- Yes.

109
00:06:43,697 --> 00:06:45,407
And yes, Gideon can do anything.

110
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:48,910
She flies the ship, makes our food,
cleans the toilets, tracks the timeline.

111
00:06:48,994 --> 00:06:50,495
Tracks the time...

112
00:06:51,871 --> 00:06:53,748
Do you mean, "Tells the future"?

113
00:06:54,624 --> 00:06:58,962
Behrad, we can make billions
off future fall trend reports.

114
00:07:00,422 --> 00:07:02,257
No, no. Rule number one of time travel,

115
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,342
never look into the future
for personal gain.

116
00:07:04,426 --> 00:07:05,426
Totally, totally.

117
00:07:05,802 --> 00:07:08,430
And rule number two,
no social media on the ship.

118
00:07:09,681 --> 00:07:11,081
I thought we were dropping you off.

119
00:07:11,641 --> 00:07:13,560
My brother, the actual superhero...

120
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:15,519
invited me to stay.

121
00:07:16,104 --> 00:07:19,482
Okay. Let's just remember
this is a place of business.

122
00:07:19,566 --> 00:07:21,586
Okay? We get called on a mission,
you need to keep out of our way.

123
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,111
Aye-aye.

124
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,488
Okay. We'll talk later.

125
00:07:26,573 --> 00:07:28,408
Sad. What a waste
of a good head of hair.

126
00:07:28,491 --> 00:07:29,492
Here you go. Hide it.

127
00:07:30,285 --> 00:07:33,038
Can your computer lady
make me some cucumber water?

128
00:07:33,121 --> 00:07:35,290
I'm parched from that dry interaction.

129
00:07:35,915 --> 00:07:38,793
<i>She and her mom had been living
out of their car for almost a year,</i>

130
00:07:38,877 --> 00:07:41,004
<i>and now, her mom has
a final round job interview.</i>

131
00:07:41,087 --> 00:07:42,255
You are incredible.

132
00:07:42,339 --> 00:07:43,340
<i>I miss you.</i>

133
00:07:44,174 --> 00:07:46,334
<i>But it feels pretty good
to be out here helping people.</i>

134
00:07:47,927 --> 00:07:49,346
- Out.
<i>- Ah,</i>

135
00:07:49,429 --> 00:07:50,764
<i>It's okay, I have to go anyway.</i>

136
00:07:50,847 --> 00:07:53,725
Okay, well, um, I'll call you later.
I love you.

137
00:07:55,226 --> 00:07:59,481
I'm sorry,
I just kind of blurted that out.

138
00:07:59,564 --> 00:08:02,400
<i>No, it's okay. It's okay.
Uh, you don't have to be sorry.</i>

139
00:08:02,484 --> 00:08:03,652
<i>I love you, too.</i>

140
00:08:04,527 --> 00:08:06,029
- You do?
- I said get out.

141
00:08:06,112 --> 00:08:07,352
<i>Okay, I'll call you later. Bye.</i>

142
00:08:09,991 --> 00:08:11,910
Mick, are you feeling all right?

143
00:08:11,993 --> 00:08:13,953
My stomach hurts. I can't eat.

144
00:08:14,037 --> 00:08:15,705
I... I can't drink.

145
00:08:15,789 --> 00:08:18,708
I think Ali gave me an STD
back at the reunion.

146
00:08:18,792 --> 00:08:19,959
Initiating scan.

147
00:08:23,129 --> 00:08:25,507
Those are not symptoms.
Those are feelings.

148
00:08:26,508 --> 00:08:29,678
Mick, I think you're developing a crush.

149
00:08:29,761 --> 00:08:31,721
Is that when you whizz and it hurts?

150
00:08:32,681 --> 00:08:37,102
No. It's biology's way of telling you
you care about someone else.

151
00:08:37,185 --> 00:08:38,603
Dr. Palmer is correct.

152
00:08:38,728 --> 00:08:42,774
The results of my body scan indicate
that you do, in fact, like-like her.

153
00:08:46,027 --> 00:08:49,531
Interim Captain Sharpe here. Team
meeting in the parlor. Over and out.

154
00:08:49,614 --> 00:08:53,868
<i>Okay. That was good. That was fun,
yet to the point. Not too...</i>

155
00:08:53,952 --> 00:08:55,662
Gideon, are you broadcasting this?

156
00:08:55,745 --> 00:08:57,789
Sorry, Ms. Sharpe.
I'll shut it down.

157
00:08:57,872 --> 00:09:00,417
Okay, thank you.
We women have to stick together.

158
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,252
I always thought of you
as one of the guys.

159
00:09:02,335 --> 00:09:03,562
Okay,
I don't know what that means...

160
00:09:03,586 --> 00:09:05,146
- He means that as a compliment.
- Yeah.

161
00:09:05,213 --> 00:09:08,758
Okay, that's for you. That's for you.

162
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,301
Okay, then.

163
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,178
Okay.

164
00:09:12,262 --> 00:09:13,972
What did I say about phones?

165
00:09:14,055 --> 00:09:16,391
What? I need to tell my boyfriend
I'm not dead.

166
00:09:17,475 --> 00:09:18,476
Uh, boyfriend?

167
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,438
Yep. Internationally renowned DJ
S'More Money.

168
00:09:22,272 --> 00:09:24,566
Ah, okay, we've got Ray.
Uh, where's Mick?

169
00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:26,526
He's sick. Lovesick.

170
00:09:26,651 --> 00:09:28,403
- Aw.
- Oh, lei.

171
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,947
So, while Sara's in Star City,

172
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,049
I wanted to introduce you all

173
00:09:32,073 --> 00:09:34,367
to something that I developed
at the Time Bureau.

174
00:09:34,451 --> 00:09:35,827
I know what you're all thinking.

175
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:38,872
"Time Bureau, hashtag stuffy.
What can we learn from those guys?"

176
00:09:38,955 --> 00:09:40,558
But we really did have
a lot of fun over there.

177
00:09:40,582 --> 00:09:41,976
Do you remember Taco Mondays, Nate?

178
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,480
- Yeah, those were some wild taco times.
- Yeah.

179
00:09:44,544 --> 00:09:45,920
- "Aloha"?
- Yes!

180
00:09:46,004 --> 00:09:51,092
A.L.O.H.A. It stands for assess,
listen, observe, hydrate...

181
00:09:51,176 --> 00:09:52,886
- Attack!
- What the...

182
00:09:52,969 --> 00:09:54,637
- Cool.
- See?

183
00:09:54,721 --> 00:09:56,431
Uh, how many pages is this?

184
00:09:56,514 --> 00:09:57,974
Ava, have you heard the proverb,

185
00:09:58,057 --> 00:10:01,102
"The fox knows many things,
the hedgehog knows one big thing."

186
00:10:01,186 --> 00:10:02,353
I have not.

187
00:10:02,437 --> 00:10:05,023
Well, Legends,
we're a fox kind of organization.

188
00:10:05,106 --> 00:10:07,609
Adaptable, off the cuff.

189
00:10:07,942 --> 00:10:10,111
This is very hedgehog.

190
00:10:10,195 --> 00:10:13,698
Trying to impose one way of doing things
onto every situation.

191
00:10:13,782 --> 00:10:16,993
And not to be rude,
is there, uh, a mission here?

192
00:10:17,076 --> 00:10:18,286
No, I just...

193
00:10:18,369 --> 00:10:20,121
Okay, then, I'm gonna introduce Zari

194
00:10:20,205 --> 00:10:22,207
to the wonders
of Gideon's Austrian toast.

195
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:24,167
Actually, it's, uh, French toast.

196
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,460
Pretty sure it's Austrian.

197
00:10:25,543 --> 00:10:26,544
Nah...

198
00:10:26,628 --> 00:10:28,755
Gideon, Gideon, check the timeline.

199
00:10:28,838 --> 00:10:30,441
It would appear
that there is a disturbance

200
00:10:30,465 --> 00:10:33,134
at the Bastille in Paris, 1793.

201
00:10:33,218 --> 00:10:36,346
While the details are still hazy,
the aftermath is traumatic.

202
00:10:36,429 --> 00:10:39,140
Thousands die
and the French Revolution collapses.

203
00:10:39,224 --> 00:10:41,518
Well, looks like we have a mission.

204
00:10:41,601 --> 00:10:43,853
So, everybody,
stop looking so <i>Les Misérables,</i>

205
00:10:43,937 --> 00:10:46,397
because we are going to France!

206
00:10:49,651 --> 00:10:51,653
Behrad, come on, we need to move.

207
00:10:59,077 --> 00:11:00,161
Hey, guys.

208
00:11:01,704 --> 00:11:04,374
I couldn't stop her.
She found the fabrication room.

209
00:11:04,457 --> 00:11:06,376
Great. She's not coming.

210
00:11:06,459 --> 00:11:08,020
We don't do ride-alongs in the field, B.

211
00:11:08,044 --> 00:11:09,921
Ava, I can handle myself in the field.

212
00:11:10,004 --> 00:11:13,007
I once played capture the flag to
raise awareness about feline OCD, so...

213
00:11:13,091 --> 00:11:14,551
This isn't a PR event, all right?

214
00:11:14,634 --> 00:11:17,279
We're walking into a deadly situation,
facing an Encore with unknown powers.

215
00:11:17,303 --> 00:11:20,098
I do not have time to keep my eye
on a party girl.

216
00:11:20,223 --> 00:11:22,684
- I do.
- What?

217
00:11:22,767 --> 00:11:25,687
I mean, come on, Ava. What's the harm?

218
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:26,771
It's against protocol

219
00:11:26,855 --> 00:11:28,791
to bring civilians into the field.

220
00:11:28,815 --> 00:11:30,375
Don't...

221
00:11:30,441 --> 00:11:35,113
Yeah, but it would be super-cool
if you just let me come anyway.

222
00:11:36,322 --> 00:11:37,866
Uh...

223
00:11:37,949 --> 00:11:39,325
- Okay, fine.
- Yay!

224
00:11:39,409 --> 00:11:41,286
Just, uh, make sure
you stay out of our way.

225
00:11:41,369 --> 00:11:42,745
Yay!

226
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:47,709
What the hell was that?

227
00:11:47,792 --> 00:11:49,752
My signature perfume, Dragonesque.

228
00:11:49,836 --> 00:11:53,464
I needed to do something to help
that extremely sad outfit.

229
00:11:54,549 --> 00:11:56,801
Spray, delay, walk away.

230
00:11:56,885 --> 00:11:58,970
Yeah, we're going this way. Jesus.

231
00:11:59,971 --> 00:12:01,431
I was just doing a runway turn.

232
00:12:05,518 --> 00:12:07,371
This period in France
was called the Reign of Terror.

233
00:12:07,395 --> 00:12:09,647
Executions were a national pastime.

234
00:12:10,231 --> 00:12:11,941
Oh, yikes.

235
00:12:12,025 --> 00:12:14,819
Yeah, we could definitely
be walking into a bloodbath.

236
00:12:14,903 --> 00:12:17,030
And you want us to go in there?

237
00:12:17,113 --> 00:12:18,907
Yeah, that's our job.

238
00:12:20,241 --> 00:12:22,410
Excuse me, sir.
Uh, we need to get in there.

239
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,620
No.

240
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:28,291
It is of vital importance
that we get in there, sir.

241
00:12:28,374 --> 00:12:29,918
Please?

242
00:12:30,001 --> 00:12:31,461
Stand back.

243
00:12:31,544 --> 00:12:33,880
This isn't a club, Zari,
it's an execution.

244
00:12:33,963 --> 00:12:35,882
An event is an event.

245
00:12:35,965 --> 00:12:37,508
Scoot. Out of the way.

246
00:12:37,592 --> 00:12:38,885
Where do you think you're going?

247
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:41,721
Um, do you know who you're talking to?

248
00:12:41,804 --> 00:12:43,139
What's your name?

249
00:12:43,222 --> 00:12:44,265
- Jean Paul.
<i>- Très bien.</i>

250
00:12:44,349 --> 00:12:46,392
Now, they'll know who to fire

251
00:12:46,476 --> 00:12:49,604
when they find out you left Zari Tarazi
standing outside.

252
00:12:50,271 --> 00:12:52,398
<i>Un grand</i> faux pas.

253
00:12:52,482 --> 00:12:54,359
Not them.

254
00:12:54,442 --> 00:12:58,029
Jean Paul, my purse isn't going to
walk in by itself.

255
00:13:10,667 --> 00:13:13,419
Um, didn't you say
this was an execution?

256
00:13:14,128 --> 00:13:15,421
Maybe Gideon got it wrong.

257
00:13:16,798 --> 00:13:19,676
Well, if they were <i>misérable,</i>
they certainly aren't anymore.

258
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,972
Stop with the thing.

259
00:13:31,104 --> 00:13:34,732
You know, you can just say the word
and I'll put you in a prime spot uptown.

260
00:13:34,816 --> 00:13:37,986
So I can rub shoulders
with all those arrogant soul traders?

261
00:13:38,069 --> 00:13:39,362
No, thank you.

262
00:13:39,445 --> 00:13:42,031
I need some help
with one of the coins you constructed.

263
00:13:43,032 --> 00:13:46,494
Help. When else do you come see me?

264
00:13:47,537 --> 00:13:49,956
I assume this is why you're here.

265
00:13:50,832 --> 00:13:54,043
- How did you...
- John Constantine.

266
00:13:55,294 --> 00:13:57,505
I remember making this.

267
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:04,512
- What do you want for him?
- Oh, I don't want to trade him.

268
00:14:04,595 --> 00:14:06,556
I want to kill him.

269
00:14:10,852 --> 00:14:13,521
Tourist attraction number two.

270
00:14:13,604 --> 00:14:16,065
The night Alex begged me
to save Natalie.

271
00:14:16,149 --> 00:14:18,609
He was supposed to pick her up
that night she got hit,

272
00:14:18,693 --> 00:14:21,863
but they had a big fight,
so, she walked.

273
00:14:22,447 --> 00:14:24,782
Alex was beside himself, he was torn up.

274
00:14:24,866 --> 00:14:26,786
Astra, she hadn't said a word
since the accident.

275
00:14:26,868 --> 00:14:28,911
How was I supposed to say no?

276
00:14:32,665 --> 00:14:35,168
Alex begged me,
but I knew I should have said no.

277
00:14:37,962 --> 00:14:40,048
Bollocks, John!
Come on, try again!

278
00:14:40,757 --> 00:14:43,259
Well, Alex wanted it,
and I just provided the how, all right?

279
00:14:43,342 --> 00:14:44,802
What's the difference, Nat?

280
00:14:44,886 --> 00:14:48,056
- So, the resurrection was your idea.
- Yes, all right?

281
00:14:50,558 --> 00:14:54,145
Nat and I, we were best friends.
How could I not try and save her?

282
00:14:57,482 --> 00:15:00,568
See? The truth can set you free.

283
00:15:07,158 --> 00:15:09,368
Is that Mucous Membrane?

284
00:15:17,543 --> 00:15:19,128
This place doesn't seem too evil.

285
00:15:19,212 --> 00:15:22,090
Yeah, well, appearances can be
deceiving. Okay, we need to figure out

286
00:15:22,173 --> 00:15:24,509
who this Encore is
and what powers they may have.

287
00:15:24,592 --> 00:15:26,677
We start with
the A.L.O.H.A. method, okay?

288
00:15:26,761 --> 00:15:29,097
Assessment, lay low, don't engage.

289
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,598
We know how to party-sneak.

290
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:33,226
Listen to me, you see something,
you say something.

291
00:15:36,229 --> 00:15:38,689
- Captain. You're trying too hard.
- Yeah.

292
00:15:39,315 --> 00:15:40,858
It's really desperate.

293
00:15:48,241 --> 00:15:51,953
So, this is your job.
Walking around parties.

294
00:15:52,036 --> 00:15:55,248
- Isn't this kind of what you do?
- Touché.

295
00:15:55,748 --> 00:15:57,333
No.

296
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:00,837
But something definitely feels off.

297
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,131
At this point in the French Revolution,

298
00:16:03,214 --> 00:16:05,800
most of the royals
had been separated from their heads.

299
00:16:05,883 --> 00:16:09,011
Even wearing a nice dress
could get you sent to the guillotine.

300
00:16:09,095 --> 00:16:11,556
Uh, and you let me
come out in this because?

301
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:14,142
I'm a sucker for a corset and an updo.

302
00:16:19,438 --> 00:16:20,606
Napoleon?

303
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:23,335
He should be marching on
southern France, not getting freaky.

304
00:16:23,359 --> 00:16:26,946
Guys, steer clear.
Exercise extreme caution.

305
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:30,366
- Relax, Ava.
<i>- I'm trying.</i>

306
00:16:36,539 --> 00:16:38,249
Nora?

307
00:16:40,168 --> 00:16:42,837
Ava? I think we found our Encore.

308
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,380
<i>She's in the VIP area.</i>

309
00:16:44,463 --> 00:16:46,841
- Nora's our Encore?
- No, Ray.

310
00:16:46,924 --> 00:16:47,967
That's Marie Antoinette.

311
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,862
And she should definitely be
without her head by now.

312
00:16:49,886 --> 00:16:52,930
<i>Great. On to
phase two of A.L. O.H.A., it's listening.</i>

313
00:16:53,014 --> 00:16:56,350
<i>Now, her powers could be anything.
Teleportation, pyrokinesis.</i>

314
00:16:56,434 --> 00:16:58,060
Fatal attractiveness.

315
00:16:59,187 --> 00:17:01,856
- I mean... Right?
- Right?

316
00:17:02,523 --> 00:17:04,567
Guys? Guys?

317
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:06,319
They're not usually like this.

318
00:17:06,402 --> 00:17:09,030
- Well, you're not usually captain.
- Thank you.

319
00:17:09,113 --> 00:17:12,700
I just swapped crêpe recipes
with a French cooking legend.

320
00:17:13,159 --> 00:17:15,453
This is the best party ever.

321
00:17:15,536 --> 00:17:17,747
Excuse me, since when do you drink?

322
00:17:18,414 --> 00:17:19,790
Whoa.

323
00:17:19,874 --> 00:17:21,751
Where did I even get that?

324
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:26,422
You know what? You're right,
something is definitely wrong.

325
00:17:27,757 --> 00:17:29,258
Move out of the way.

326
00:17:31,385 --> 00:17:33,763
It is time!

327
00:17:37,934 --> 00:17:39,518
Of course.

328
00:17:39,602 --> 00:17:41,771
The perfect revenge.
A magical guillotine.

329
00:17:41,854 --> 00:17:43,522
Shh.

330
00:17:43,606 --> 00:17:46,567
Guys, be careful.
I think Marie's about to make her move.

331
00:17:51,322 --> 00:17:52,322
Now!

332
00:17:53,658 --> 00:17:55,993
Let them eat cake!

333
00:18:19,892 --> 00:18:21,328
- Pardon me.
- Pardon me.

334
00:18:24,021 --> 00:18:25,690
So, it's not a guillotine.

335
00:18:25,773 --> 00:18:29,068
What day is it?

336
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:32,238
Uh, how long have you been here?

337
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,995
Oh, my God, he's dead.

338
00:18:39,078 --> 00:18:41,580
Ugh. He literally
partied himself to death.

339
00:18:42,498 --> 00:18:44,875
- So tacky.
- Look. No, he's not the only one.

340
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:46,919
What is happening?

341
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,380
That's why I don't eat carbs.

342
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:52,883
This woman is next-level popular.

343
00:18:52,967 --> 00:18:56,012
People would rather die than leave.

344
00:18:56,721 --> 00:18:58,681
- Talk about FOMO.
- God, that's it.

345
00:18:58,764 --> 00:19:01,392
Marie Antoinette was beheaded
for partying while France starved,

346
00:19:01,475 --> 00:19:03,328
and now, she is literally
killing the Revolution

347
00:19:03,352 --> 00:19:04,812
with a non-stop party.

348
00:19:04,895 --> 00:19:08,816
Legends, we figured it out.
Charm is her superpower.

349
00:19:08,899 --> 00:19:11,736
Hello? Ray? Nate? Behrad?

350
00:19:11,819 --> 00:19:14,113
It's like she's gotten to everyone
except for us.

351
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:15,364
So, we have to stop this.

352
00:19:15,448 --> 00:19:19,118
- Wait. I'm on the team?
- Sure.

353
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:20,578
Okay, what's the plan?

354
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:21,704
Uh...

355
00:19:22,038 --> 00:19:23,974
We have to find a way
to get Marie Antoinette out of here

356
00:19:23,998 --> 00:19:25,041
without a riot.

357
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:29,837
The only way to get a celebrity
to leave her own party quietly,

358
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,840
is to make her think
there's a cooler party somewhere else

359
00:19:32,923 --> 00:19:34,216
that she's not at.

360
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,510
- Let's go tell her.
- Uh, girl.

361
00:19:36,594 --> 00:19:39,847
You're not going to get anywhere
in this ensemble.

362
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:41,474
What are you doing? Stop it.

363
00:19:41,557 --> 00:19:43,184
Hey.

364
00:19:43,267 --> 00:19:44,518
Trust me.

365
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:47,188
Shh.

366
00:19:47,646 --> 00:19:48,647
Come on.

367
00:19:53,235 --> 00:19:55,613
That's her. Natalie.

368
00:19:56,405 --> 00:19:58,657
- She's good.
- Yeah.

369
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:04,997
You loved her.

370
00:20:05,081 --> 00:20:07,208
It's quite the track record, isn't it?

371
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:10,669
One lover sent to Hell,
the other one a ghost.

372
00:20:12,713 --> 00:20:15,758
Please, John, it's eating you up.
You have to stop.

373
00:20:15,841 --> 00:20:18,362
Look, Natalie, you're gonna have
to trust me on this one, all right?

374
00:20:18,386 --> 00:20:20,096
I've got it under control.

375
00:20:20,179 --> 00:20:23,015
If Lester hadn't been there,
I would have lost you tonight.

376
00:20:25,017 --> 00:20:28,020
Look, let's just leave all this behind.

377
00:20:28,104 --> 00:20:31,565
We'll go to New York. We'll start clean.

378
00:20:32,358 --> 00:20:36,529
You have to choose. Magic or me.

379
00:20:43,702 --> 00:20:45,621
Screw you, John Constantine!

380
00:20:45,704 --> 00:20:47,164
All right, that's enough, all right?

381
00:20:47,248 --> 00:20:50,042
I don't want you in my head
or in my memories!

382
00:20:50,126 --> 00:20:51,210
No more games!

383
00:20:51,293 --> 00:20:53,563
Look, we're trapped in this house
with a knife-wielding ghost,

384
00:20:53,587 --> 00:20:55,482
and you're still refusing to own up
to your past.

385
00:20:55,506 --> 00:20:57,299
You are a fine one to talk, aren't you?

386
00:20:57,383 --> 00:21:00,678
Why don't we poke around
in your closet for a while, eh?

387
00:21:00,761 --> 00:21:02,322
- Why did you leave, Charlie?
- Uh, guys?

388
00:21:02,346 --> 00:21:04,473
- I'm no hero. It was time to go.
- Guys. Guys. Guys!

389
00:21:04,557 --> 00:21:07,143
Yeah? What, you just wandered
into my house looking for a party?

390
00:21:07,226 --> 00:21:08,644
What are you really doing here, eh?

391
00:21:08,727 --> 00:21:10,855
Don't even try and turn this
on me, all right?

392
00:21:10,938 --> 00:21:12,538
It's your lies
that have trapped us here.

393
00:21:20,364 --> 00:21:21,924
She's right, John.

394
00:21:22,116 --> 00:21:24,994
Natalie, is that really you?

395
00:21:35,212 --> 00:21:38,048
Every level of the party
has its guardians.

396
00:21:38,132 --> 00:21:40,885
Getting past the bouncer, easy.
Getting past the friends...

397
00:21:41,969 --> 00:21:43,846
you need to know someone.

398
00:21:44,972 --> 00:21:46,056
But we don't know anybody.

399
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,683
I know...

400
00:21:48,309 --> 00:21:49,852
that guy.

401
00:21:49,935 --> 00:21:51,187
You know Napoleon?

402
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,855
No, but they don't know that.

403
00:21:53,314 --> 00:21:55,107
<i>Bonjour,</i> Napoleon.

404
00:21:58,152 --> 00:22:00,154
We're with him.

405
00:22:03,073 --> 00:22:05,993
Oh, she's separated from the pack.
Now's the time.

406
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:07,703
Oh, good. Work your magic.

407
00:22:07,786 --> 00:22:09,663
Oh, teaching moment.

408
00:22:09,747 --> 00:22:12,374
The big secret to being cool?
Confidence.

409
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:15,586
It makes people think
you have something they don't.

410
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:18,229
- You got this, Captain. There you go.
- No, but I don't... Ah...

411
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,510
Thank you.

412
00:22:28,557 --> 00:22:30,226
I do not know you.

413
00:22:31,227 --> 00:22:32,728
What are you doing here?

414
00:22:33,312 --> 00:22:35,397
- Uh...
- Hmm?

415
00:22:35,481 --> 00:22:38,275
- Leaving.
- Leaving?

416
00:22:41,529 --> 00:22:45,574
Actually, I am going to the after-party.

417
00:22:46,492 --> 00:22:48,244
What is this <i>après</i> party?

418
00:22:48,327 --> 00:22:49,537
Mmm.

419
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:52,957
It's a party after the party.
It's the best place to be.

420
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,459
- Where is it?
- Mmm, I can't tell you.

421
00:22:55,626 --> 00:22:57,294
But I can take you.

422
00:22:57,378 --> 00:22:59,713
Really? Take me.

423
00:23:03,092 --> 00:23:04,008
Oh, oh.

424
00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:06,470
Um, this is my bestie, Zari.
She's coming with.

425
00:23:06,554 --> 00:23:08,472
Yas, queen. Mmm.

426
00:23:08,556 --> 00:23:10,617
Guys, I have Marie and we're taking her
to the <i>Waverider.</i>

427
00:23:10,641 --> 00:23:13,435
That's a great idea.
We'll have her all to ourselves.

428
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:16,772
- Whoo!
- Marie, come back!

429
00:23:19,567 --> 00:23:21,777
There is an <i>après</i> party!

430
00:23:26,448 --> 00:23:27,783
Guys, you have company.

431
00:23:28,742 --> 00:23:30,119
The after-party is right this way.

432
00:23:39,795 --> 00:23:41,255
Corsets are so impractical!

433
00:23:42,172 --> 00:23:43,716
Marie, where's the party?

434
00:23:46,135 --> 00:23:48,637
I do not think this is a good idea.

435
00:23:48,721 --> 00:23:50,806
We're gonna party our faces off.
It's gonna be great.

436
00:24:03,694 --> 00:24:04,695
Ew.

437
00:24:04,778 --> 00:24:06,238
Should've seen that coming.

438
00:24:06,322 --> 00:24:08,532
Return me to my body this instant...

439
00:24:08,616 --> 00:24:09,658
Okay, body, Here we go.

440
00:24:10,868 --> 00:24:12,161
This is weird.

441
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:19,668
This party stinks!

442
00:24:19,752 --> 00:24:21,253
Oh, so true, girl.

443
00:24:23,005 --> 00:24:24,340
But not the point.

444
00:24:24,423 --> 00:24:26,508
- She's annoying. You can just...
- Yeah.

445
00:24:26,592 --> 00:24:28,552
Take this thing off of me!

446
00:24:28,927 --> 00:24:31,305
Ugh, I can't believe I tried to drink.

447
00:24:31,388 --> 00:24:33,116
I can't believe I ate
all that gluten-filled cake.

448
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,700
I can't believe how heavy that head is.

449
00:24:34,767 --> 00:24:36,367
Yeah, she really had you
under her spell.

450
00:24:36,435 --> 00:24:37,787
If it weren't for
our interim Legend here,

451
00:24:37,811 --> 00:24:39,080
you guys would've partied to death.

452
00:24:39,104 --> 00:24:40,665
Well, just to play it safe, I'm gonna...

453
00:24:40,689 --> 00:24:42,399
Stay away! Don't you touch me!

454
00:24:42,483 --> 00:24:45,569
- Gonna take this into the library.
- I'll bite your finger!

455
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,697
- I'll help you.
- Don't get creepy, Ray.

456
00:24:48,781 --> 00:24:51,200
So, my sister, the superhero.

457
00:24:51,283 --> 00:24:53,077
Should I get Gideon to make you a cowl?

458
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,913
Mmm, cowls are for middle-aged women
who wanna hide their necks.

459
00:24:55,996 --> 00:24:58,832
But I do need a dress
for the party tonight.

460
00:24:58,916 --> 00:25:01,960
- The fabricator's all yours.
- Yay! Thank you.

461
00:25:05,673 --> 00:25:07,049
Is that really you, Nat?

462
00:25:08,217 --> 00:25:10,057
I need to hear you say it.

463
00:25:10,886 --> 00:25:12,638
Why did you bring me back?

464
00:25:13,639 --> 00:25:16,308
Because I loved you, Nat.

465
00:25:16,392 --> 00:25:17,601
I never stopped.

466
00:25:18,644 --> 00:25:22,606
I'm not here for the John Constantine
broken hero act.

467
00:25:27,403 --> 00:25:28,987
Say it to my face.

468
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:32,241
I need to hear the truth.

469
00:25:33,867 --> 00:25:35,577
I brought you back...

470
00:25:37,121 --> 00:25:39,206
to prove to you that I was right.

471
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:43,752
To show you that I was right
to choose magic over us.

472
00:25:48,757 --> 00:25:49,883
Thank you.

473
00:25:51,969 --> 00:25:55,264
I needed you to admit
to yourself what you did.

474
00:25:55,472 --> 00:25:57,391
Because if you're going to save Astra,

475
00:25:57,474 --> 00:26:00,561
you need to do it for her,
not for your ego.

476
00:26:00,644 --> 00:26:02,312
Oh, I have tried to save her, Nat.

477
00:26:02,396 --> 00:26:06,108
I have tried, but I don't know how.

478
00:26:06,859 --> 00:26:08,485
I think I found a way.

479
00:26:15,367 --> 00:26:18,871
Uh, yoo-hoo.

480
00:26:19,413 --> 00:26:21,248
Hello? Excuse me?

481
00:26:21,331 --> 00:26:24,543
Can you help me? Where is my body?

482
00:26:24,626 --> 00:26:27,296
You were throwing a party
intended to kill people,

483
00:26:27,379 --> 00:26:29,590
so, no, not gonna help you.

484
00:26:32,301 --> 00:26:36,847
When I was 14,
I was forced to leave my family.

485
00:26:38,515 --> 00:26:42,269
People saw the dresses,
the parties, the hair...

486
00:26:43,061 --> 00:26:47,316
and they assumed I was a spoiled brat.

487
00:26:48,358 --> 00:26:53,864
Really, I was just
a lonely Viennese girl

488
00:26:53,947 --> 00:26:56,742
trying to fit into French society.

489
00:26:56,825 --> 00:27:00,245
I've been famous
since I was six years old.

490
00:27:00,329 --> 00:27:03,957
I don't know if people love me
or love to hate me.

491
00:27:04,374 --> 00:27:08,253
What they don't understand is how hard
I work to create a fantasy for them.

492
00:27:08,754 --> 00:27:13,675
The secret is
to never let the party stop.

493
00:27:14,009 --> 00:27:16,720
If I had known then what I know now...

494
00:27:18,138 --> 00:27:22,100
Gidget, is there anything
I need to worry about?

495
00:27:22,184 --> 00:27:23,519
Interim Captain Sharpe

496
00:27:23,602 --> 00:27:25,813
instructed you
not to look at your future.

497
00:27:25,938 --> 00:27:29,066
Just a peek,
little lady computer.

498
00:27:29,525 --> 00:27:33,028
As you wish. October 7th, 2045...

499
00:27:33,111 --> 00:27:36,323
<i>Zari Tarazi faces major backlash
from her fans,</i>

500
00:27:36,406 --> 00:27:40,786
<i>known as Z-Nation, after the FDA
banned her perfume Dragonesque</i>

501
00:27:40,869 --> 00:27:43,664
<i>for destroying users' sense of smell.</i>

502
00:27:43,747 --> 00:27:45,165
Oh, no.

503
00:27:45,457 --> 00:27:48,836
<i>I trusted her! I wanted to be her,</i>

504
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:51,964
<i>but now, I'll never smell another flower
because of her.</i>

505
00:27:52,047 --> 00:27:54,591
<i>From Z-Nation to Zero-Nation,</i>

506
00:27:54,675 --> 00:27:58,053
<i>Zari Tarazi's Cat-Chat followers
have plummeted</i>

507
00:27:58,136 --> 00:27:59,972
<i>to almost zero.</i>

508
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:03,392
<i>Meow!</i>

509
00:28:03,976 --> 00:28:08,021
But I didn't know there was anything
wrong with the perfume.

510
00:28:09,022 --> 00:28:10,524
This is so unfair.

511
00:28:12,067 --> 00:28:14,027
Okay, I have to
get out in front of this.

512
00:28:15,153 --> 00:28:17,739
Maybe Gidget can make me a new perfume.

513
00:28:19,533 --> 00:28:21,368
Or I can just take yours.

514
00:28:21,451 --> 00:28:23,745
No, you cannot have it.

515
00:28:24,204 --> 00:28:26,564
I mean, it's not like you're using it.
You have half a neck.

516
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:30,586
Why do you care so much
about a bottle of...

517
00:28:35,173 --> 00:28:39,219
Oh! You're not super-charming.

518
00:28:39,303 --> 00:28:42,681
You used magical popularity perfume.

519
00:28:42,764 --> 00:28:45,726
Honestly, that makes me feel
better about myself.

520
00:28:48,103 --> 00:28:49,229
What are you doing?

521
00:28:51,148 --> 00:28:52,774
Can't have you ratting me out.

522
00:29:27,351 --> 00:29:29,519
Oh, there you are. Thank God. Thank God.

523
00:29:29,603 --> 00:29:32,940
I have been so worried,
but don't... don't worry,

524
00:29:33,023 --> 00:29:35,168
I've... I've totally been keeping up
your Cat-Chat account.

525
00:29:35,192 --> 00:29:38,236
Yesterday, I posted a picture
of a cat licking

526
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,905
a tube of Dragonesque lipstick.

527
00:29:39,988 --> 00:29:43,408
Gross, Les-Lay, I would never post that.

528
00:29:44,368 --> 00:29:46,995
I am so sorry, I will delete it.

529
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:51,291
And here is the hero bottle
for the photoshoot.

530
00:29:51,375 --> 00:29:53,919
Actually, change of plans.

531
00:29:54,044 --> 00:29:55,963
- Oh, so retro.
- Take this.

532
00:29:57,047 --> 00:29:58,507
Oh!

533
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:00,050
- Hey, Z... Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Hi!

534
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:02,511
- Watch the s'more. What are you doing?
- Sorry, babe.

535
00:30:02,594 --> 00:30:04,781
So, have you decided where
you want to do the proposal yet?

536
00:30:04,805 --> 00:30:07,599
- The what?
- Didn't my agent call you?

537
00:30:07,683 --> 00:30:10,519
Yeah, I haven't had a chance
to tell you yet, Z,

538
00:30:10,602 --> 00:30:14,064
but S'More's team came up with
the most epic idea.

539
00:30:14,147 --> 00:30:18,860
He should propose to you
at next week's MTV Movie Awards

540
00:30:18,944 --> 00:30:22,823
in advance of your DJ and Z
co-branded sunglasses launch.

541
00:30:22,906 --> 00:30:24,741
We're getting married?

542
00:30:24,825 --> 00:30:26,868
Yo, we could do it
somewhere more chill, you know,

543
00:30:26,952 --> 00:30:29,180
like at the DJ S'More Money
Spring Break House Party live cast,

544
00:30:29,204 --> 00:30:30,247
something like that?

545
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:32,332
- How romantic.
- Yeah, it's gonna be dope.

546
00:30:32,416 --> 00:30:35,377
- Okay, let's do this. Hey!
- You're ready for this. Let's go.

547
00:30:36,128 --> 00:30:40,298
Okay, one spritz should be safe.
Spray, delay, walk away.

548
00:30:41,466 --> 00:30:44,803
You have to do a 23andMe.
I mean, she must be related to you.

549
00:30:44,886 --> 00:30:47,764
Here, doesn't she look exactly like you?

550
00:30:47,848 --> 00:30:51,393
<i>Ray, I am looking at a gagged,
decapitated woman.</i>

551
00:30:51,476 --> 00:30:54,396
<i>If that's what you think I look like,
we have a lot of processing to do.</i>

552
00:30:54,479 --> 00:30:56,690
Oh, no, but... Sorry, Ms. Antoinette.

553
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,695
Thief!

554
00:31:02,654 --> 00:31:03,739
Can you taste the cardamom?

555
00:31:03,822 --> 00:31:06,175
I can't. I can't taste anything
because your sister's perfume

556
00:31:06,199 --> 00:31:09,202
clogged up my entire olfactory system.
Everything tastes like...

557
00:31:09,286 --> 00:31:12,664
Zari... Zari stole
Marie Antoinette's perfume.

558
00:31:12,748 --> 00:31:15,018
You should see what Mick
stole from Mexico, it's disgusting.

559
00:31:15,042 --> 00:31:15,958
Consider ourselves lucky.

560
00:31:15,959 --> 00:31:17,895
At least she didn't do something
to screw up history.

561
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:21,339
Oh, my God, the perfume!
That's how Marie did it.

562
00:31:21,423 --> 00:31:22,549
Zari and I weren't affected

563
00:31:22,632 --> 00:31:24,718
'cause we couldn't smell
because of the Dragonesque.

564
00:31:24,801 --> 00:31:27,054
Who knows what kind of damage
she could do with that?

565
00:31:27,137 --> 00:31:30,140
It's all my fault.
I shouldn't have let her stay.

566
00:31:30,223 --> 00:31:32,726
I knew it was too early
to pat myself on the back.

567
00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:35,246
Ah. Look, it wouldn't be a true Legends'
mission unless something went wrong.

568
00:31:39,816 --> 00:31:41,234
Or several things.

569
00:31:47,032 --> 00:31:49,951
Uh, wasn't there
a body on that stretcher?

570
00:31:54,706 --> 00:31:57,167
- Zari!
- Zari! Over here!

571
00:32:03,965 --> 00:32:06,176
Have I told you how hot
you look in that dress?

572
00:32:06,259 --> 00:32:08,220
No, but you can tell me now.

573
00:32:08,303 --> 00:32:09,387
Super-hot!

574
00:32:11,348 --> 00:32:13,225
And you smell fantastic!

575
00:32:13,767 --> 00:32:16,686
You know what, screw our agents.
I don't wanna wait

576
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:19,606
till the fall launch
of our sunglasses in October

577
00:32:19,689 --> 00:32:21,817
to begin my life with you.

578
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:25,028
Hey, listen up. S'More Money
has an announcement to make.

579
00:32:25,112 --> 00:32:28,490
Zari Tarazi, will you marry me?

580
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:29,740
Oh, S'More...

581
00:32:42,712 --> 00:32:45,173
I think I just got a little too popular.

582
00:32:46,967 --> 00:32:47,967
Oh, God.

583
00:32:53,765 --> 00:32:56,893
Here, body, body, body, body.

584
00:32:56,977 --> 00:32:58,562
Oh.

585
00:33:00,355 --> 00:33:03,275
Okay, body. No one wants to hurt you.

586
00:33:03,441 --> 00:33:04,651
Speak for yourself.

587
00:33:04,734 --> 00:33:07,279
Hey, come on, Mick. She's harmless.

588
00:33:07,362 --> 00:33:10,115
It's just a headless body.

589
00:33:13,577 --> 00:33:15,617
Mick, a little help here.
Just target the right arm.

590
00:33:17,289 --> 00:33:18,790
No, Mick, don't...

591
00:33:38,852 --> 00:33:41,563
Okay, we need to protect ourselves.
Zari's deployed Marie's perfume.

592
00:33:41,646 --> 00:33:42,646
Ahh!

593
00:33:46,401 --> 00:33:49,237
Okay, team, A.L.O.H.A. time.

594
00:33:51,573 --> 00:33:53,116
Run! Run!

595
00:33:56,036 --> 00:33:57,245
Nate, what do you got?

596
00:33:57,329 --> 00:33:59,289
I'm assessing Zari used too much
of the perfume

597
00:33:59,372 --> 00:34:01,666
'cause this crowd is bananas.

598
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,418
<i>- Behrad?</i>
- I'm listening

599
00:34:03,501 --> 00:34:05,170
and I hear another mob coming.

600
00:34:05,253 --> 00:34:08,340
Okay, I'm observing and there are way
too many people for us to stop.

601
00:34:08,423 --> 00:34:10,463
We need to get that perfume
off of her to stop this.

602
00:34:10,634 --> 00:34:13,345
- How?
- I have an idea. I need your help.

603
00:34:27,609 --> 00:34:28,777
Behrad, now!

604
00:34:33,823 --> 00:34:36,493
- You guys came back for me.
- A Legend never gets left behind,

605
00:34:36,576 --> 00:34:37,869
even an interim one. Follow me.

606
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,538
- What are you doing?
- Trust me.

607
00:34:41,248 --> 00:34:43,488
<i>There's too many of them.
I can't stop them all.</i>

608
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,128
- Come on!
- Okay.

609
00:34:50,715 --> 00:34:53,843
Well, we've tried the A.L.O.H.A. method.
The A.L.O. haven't got us anywhere.

610
00:34:53,927 --> 00:34:55,262
What does the "H" stand for?

611
00:34:55,595 --> 00:34:56,595
Hydrate!

612
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:07,941
- S'Mores.
- Yeah.

613
00:35:08,024 --> 00:35:09,264
- Zari's boyfriend?
- That's me.

614
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,321
- Okay, guys.
- Oh, God.

615
00:35:13,405 --> 00:35:14,614
Party's over.

616
00:35:16,741 --> 00:35:18,493
Did Zari just jump into the fountain?

617
00:35:18,618 --> 00:35:20,829
Talk about desperate stunts.

618
00:35:21,204 --> 00:35:23,748
I'm calling my agent
to schedule a divorce!

619
00:35:25,166 --> 00:35:26,835
Wait, what does that last "A" stand for?

620
00:35:26,918 --> 00:35:28,003
Attack!

621
00:35:44,936 --> 00:35:46,563
Look at us.

622
00:35:47,022 --> 00:35:49,691
We thought we could change the world
with our little loom.

623
00:35:49,899 --> 00:35:52,235
This one's to bring me mum back.

624
00:35:54,362 --> 00:35:57,741
The Loom of Fate.
It's not just a story, it's real.

625
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:00,493
Three old Greek birds cutting threads,

626
00:36:01,286 --> 00:36:05,415
hunkering down over a loom to weave
together the fate of humankind.

627
00:36:06,875 --> 00:36:09,377
No, if it's real,
how come I haven't heard of it, eh?

628
00:36:10,003 --> 00:36:11,671
You're asking the wrong person.

629
00:36:12,797 --> 00:36:14,632
Why do you think I brought her here?

630
00:36:18,386 --> 00:36:19,929
What the bloody hell was that?

631
00:36:20,013 --> 00:36:21,806
What do you know about the Loom of Fate?

632
00:36:21,973 --> 00:36:24,642
- I know bugger all.
- How'd you find this place, Charlie?

633
00:36:24,726 --> 00:36:25,852
You told me about it.

634
00:36:25,935 --> 00:36:27,204
Oh, bollocks,
I've never told anyone about it.

635
00:36:27,228 --> 00:36:30,774
Natalie brought you here to help me
save Astra and stop those Encores.

636
00:36:30,857 --> 00:36:32,752
So tell me, what do you know
about the Loom of Fate?

637
00:36:32,776 --> 00:36:33,692
Fate's a load of crap.

638
00:36:33,693 --> 00:36:35,171
You haven't answered
my question, Charlie.

639
00:36:35,195 --> 00:36:36,881
- You wanna know what I'm hiding from?
- Yes, I do!

640
00:36:36,905 --> 00:36:38,365
It's that bloody Loom!

641
00:36:42,452 --> 00:36:44,579
- So, it is real.
- It was.

642
00:36:45,997 --> 00:36:47,624
Until I destroyed it.

643
00:36:52,128 --> 00:36:55,215
"Lady in Cheap Pantsuit Ruins Party."

644
00:36:55,298 --> 00:36:57,801
Ava was right
about no phones on the ship.

645
00:36:57,884 --> 00:37:00,678
I had Gideon whip you up
some new clothes. Hope you like flannel.

646
00:37:00,762 --> 00:37:02,680
I do not. Ew.

647
00:37:03,431 --> 00:37:06,768
Listen, I know you're gonna tell me
how selfish I was

648
00:37:06,851 --> 00:37:09,437
for stealing the perfume
and burning the team.

649
00:37:09,521 --> 00:37:12,107
You guys toil away in obscurity
to save humanity

650
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:14,901
from unknown baddies
and I just go and spray evil perfume

651
00:37:14,984 --> 00:37:17,862
all over New York City
without a second thought.

652
00:37:17,946 --> 00:37:20,407
I'm a jerk. I'm sorry.

653
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:22,283
I was gonna ask if you wanted a donut.

654
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:28,832
I haven't had a donut in 1,743 days.

655
00:37:31,668 --> 00:37:34,170
What is this donut?

656
00:37:34,254 --> 00:37:35,934
- Shut up, Marie.
- Ah...

657
00:37:36,631 --> 00:37:37,799
Getting healthier...

658
00:37:38,091 --> 00:37:39,134
Hey.

659
00:37:40,135 --> 00:37:42,429
Wow. Nice shirt.

660
00:37:42,554 --> 00:37:45,640
Hmm. You would be into lumberjack chic.

661
00:37:45,723 --> 00:37:47,963
There's an incoming hologram
from Captain Lance.

662
00:37:48,017 --> 00:37:49,644
Captain.

663
00:37:49,769 --> 00:37:51,020
How'd the mission go?

664
00:37:51,104 --> 00:37:52,522
Oh, um...

665
00:37:54,149 --> 00:37:56,776
- Well, I...
- Killed it.

666
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,903
She was a foxy hedgehog out there.

667
00:38:00,155 --> 00:38:01,197
Okay.

668
00:38:01,281 --> 00:38:02,574
We got our Encore, Captain.

669
00:38:02,657 --> 00:38:04,659
Oh, good, I'm glad to hear it.

670
00:38:05,201 --> 00:38:07,579
Ava, call me later,
so I can thank you properly.

671
00:38:10,665 --> 00:38:12,417
O captain, my captain.

672
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,353
"Call me later, so I can
properly congratulate you..."

673
00:38:14,377 --> 00:38:15,462
Guys, come on.

674
00:38:15,545 --> 00:38:17,225
She doesn't sound like that.

675
00:38:35,899 --> 00:38:37,317
Zari!

676
00:38:38,109 --> 00:38:39,611
Hey, are you okay?

677
00:38:40,069 --> 00:38:44,199
Yeah, I was...
I was just, uh, enjoying this donut.

678
00:38:44,782 --> 00:38:46,784
And thinking...

679
00:38:48,495 --> 00:38:52,790
You locked Marie Antoinette up,
but you let me off the hook.

680
00:38:53,166 --> 00:38:56,336
I mean, she killed people, Zari.

681
00:38:56,419 --> 00:38:58,963
You screwed up.
You know, everybody screws up.

682
00:38:59,047 --> 00:39:01,674
- Not you.
- Me?

683
00:39:01,758 --> 00:39:03,358
I feel like I'm
screwing up all the time.

684
00:39:03,426 --> 00:39:05,428
You were so on-mission.

685
00:39:05,512 --> 00:39:07,889
You crashed an A-list party
in a pantsuit

686
00:39:07,972 --> 00:39:09,807
and threw yourself into a fountain.

687
00:39:09,891 --> 00:39:12,727
Ugh, see? It's a perfect example.

688
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:15,897
No, it was amazing.
You didn't care what anyone thought.

689
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,899
You were just being you.

690
00:39:20,151 --> 00:39:23,988
I've been trying to get people
to like me for so long, that...

691
00:39:26,699 --> 00:39:29,369
I've forgotten who I really am.

692
00:39:29,702 --> 00:39:34,624
I have millions of followers,
but zero friends.

693
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,586
You got one.

694
00:39:41,172 --> 00:39:42,172
Really?

695
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:48,680
Come on.

696
00:39:50,807 --> 00:39:55,103
Hmm. Well, as your friend,
I have to tell you,

697
00:39:55,186 --> 00:39:58,231
no more pantsuits.
You're better than that.

698
00:39:58,314 --> 00:39:59,314
Deal.

699
00:40:03,027 --> 00:40:05,989
He still has ten years before
the lung cancer catches up to him.

700
00:40:06,364 --> 00:40:07,865
Can you make it zero?

701
00:40:08,533 --> 00:40:12,036
That's a nasty way to go,
especially all at once.

702
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,663
You sure that's who you wanna be?

703
00:40:13,746 --> 00:40:16,791
Why is it so hard for people
to let little girls grow up?

704
00:40:18,418 --> 00:40:21,504
John may be the villain in your story,

705
00:40:21,921 --> 00:40:25,216
but in mine, he's just
cocktail party conversation.

706
00:40:25,925 --> 00:40:27,802
I have a few enemies of my own.

707
00:40:28,845 --> 00:40:31,806
One day, I'm going to call you

708
00:40:31,889 --> 00:40:35,435
and you are going to do me a favor.

709
00:40:35,518 --> 00:40:37,854
You make "favor" sound like "sin."

710
00:40:39,397 --> 00:40:41,482
This is Hell, sweetie.

711
00:40:43,901 --> 00:40:45,028
Do it.

712
00:40:53,411 --> 00:40:56,539
You broke the Loom of Fate?
How old are you?

713
00:40:56,623 --> 00:40:57,624
Old.

714
00:40:57,707 --> 00:40:59,834
If you broke it,
why are you still running?

715
00:41:03,296 --> 00:41:06,507
I scattered those damn pieces
all across the multi-verse.

716
00:41:07,342 --> 00:41:09,260
Just put an end to it all.

717
00:41:10,428 --> 00:41:14,390
But recently, I sensed that
something had changed.

718
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:19,103
It's like my past
was catching up with me. So...

719
00:41:21,648 --> 00:41:22,648
John, are you okay?

720
00:41:23,107 --> 00:41:24,901
Yeah. I just got a...

721
00:41:32,283 --> 00:41:33,701
Bye-bye, Johnny.
