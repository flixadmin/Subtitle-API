1
00:00:01,101 --> 00:00:03,751
Time travel is real, and all of history

2
00:00:03,776 --> 00:00:06,087
is vulnerable to attack,
which is why we must

3
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:08,055
travel through time to stop the spread

4
00:00:08,057 --> 00:00:10,257
of these so-called time aberrations

5
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:12,727
and to erase their damage to history.

6
00:00:12,729 --> 00:00:15,229
We are a team of outcasts and misfits,

7
00:00:15,231 --> 00:00:17,398
so, please, don't call us heroes.

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,333
We're legends.

9
00:00:19,562 --> 00:00:21,830
Previously, on “Legends of Tomorrow”...

10
00:00:21,832 --> 00:00:23,499
- Mick has elected to stay.
- Why?

11
00:00:23,501 --> 00:00:25,601
Someone needs to be
present to destroy the Oculus.

12
00:00:27,138 --> 00:00:28,437
Get him out of here.

13
00:00:31,909 --> 00:00:35,511
He traded his life
for ours. He was a hero.

14
00:00:35,513 --> 00:00:38,047
Leonard. I must be losing my mind.

15
00:00:38,049 --> 00:00:39,681
You're not riding ahead, Mick.

16
00:00:39,683 --> 00:00:42,251
That's why I'm here...
To set you straight.

17
00:00:42,253 --> 00:00:44,653
The amulet. Why is it so important?

18
00:00:44,655 --> 00:00:47,589
Hand over the box.

19
00:00:47,591 --> 00:00:49,091
I swiped it off Darhk.

20
00:00:49,093 --> 00:00:51,026
You have something
we need. I would like to

21
00:00:51,028 --> 00:00:52,861
- broker a deal with you.
- How did you manage

22
00:00:52,863 --> 00:00:54,930
- to defeat him?
- I gave him the amulet.

23
00:00:54,932 --> 00:00:56,165
It's a compass.

24
00:00:56,167 --> 00:00:58,367
Compasses generally find things.

25
00:00:58,369 --> 00:01:02,037
Have either of you gentlemen
heard of the Spear of Destiny?

26
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:04,673
It can be used to
rewrite reality itself.

27
00:01:04,675 --> 00:01:06,208
- How do we find it?
- You remember

28
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:10,179
- Captain Rip Hunter?
- Cut!

29
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,500
_

30
00:01:26,197 --> 00:01:28,764
Oof.

31
00:01:28,766 --> 00:01:30,599
Gideon! What's our status?

32
00:01:30,601 --> 00:01:32,868
The Waverider is surprisingly
not destroyed, Captain.

33
00:01:34,405 --> 00:01:36,472
Though that condition
may not be permanent.

34
00:01:43,481 --> 00:01:45,747
How long will it take to effect repairs?

35
00:01:45,749 --> 00:01:46,815
15 years.

36
00:01:48,185 --> 00:01:49,618
Well, that won't do.

37
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:01,330
What is that, Captain?

38
00:02:01,332 --> 00:02:04,833
There are some things,
Gideon, I can't even tell you.

39
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:11,406
Initiate repair procedures.

40
00:02:11,408 --> 00:02:13,809
Auto-repair engaged.

41
00:02:13,811 --> 00:02:15,410
Shogun Ballistic.

42
00:02:15,412 --> 00:02:17,613
Captain, that is the shut down code

43
00:02:17,615 --> 00:02:19,295
for my primary syst...

44
00:02:33,164 --> 00:02:36,698
Angels and ministers of grace...

45
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,767
defend us...

46
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:46,350
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -

47
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:02,324
You're my best friend.

48
00:03:05,229 --> 00:03:06,828
I love you, man.

49
00:03:08,699 --> 00:03:10,399
What did you hear?

50
00:03:10,401 --> 00:03:14,836
Nothing, absolutely nothing.

51
00:03:14,838 --> 00:03:17,472
Though... Though if
I did, I suppose I...

52
00:03:17,474 --> 00:03:22,177
- I might be flattered.
- I wasn't talking to you.

53
00:03:22,179 --> 00:03:24,379
Perhaps you've had enough
to drink for for one night.

54
00:03:24,381 --> 00:03:28,550
That's the point. I haven't had enough.

55
00:03:28,552 --> 00:03:32,688
So if you weren't talking to me, then...

56
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:34,723
- Snart.
- Snart what?

57
00:03:34,725 --> 00:03:37,759
I've been talking to Snart.
I've been seeing him lately.

58
00:03:37,761 --> 00:03:39,928
You... You've been having
hallucinations of Leonard Snart?

59
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,830
If you tell anyone, I'll kill you

60
00:03:41,832 --> 00:03:43,999
I believe you.

61
00:03:44,001 --> 00:03:46,268
- You can fix me.
- Me?

62
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,936
- You're a doctor.
- Of nuclear physics.

63
00:03:47,938 --> 00:03:49,972
- Same thing.
- Mr. Rory, I can't...

64
00:03:49,974 --> 00:03:53,675
You can fix me, but you
can't tell anybody about it.

65
00:03:53,677 --> 00:03:54,943
- You got that?
- Yes.

66
00:03:54,945 --> 00:03:56,445
You got that?

67
00:04:02,987 --> 00:04:04,419
Nate.

68
00:04:04,421 --> 00:04:05,721
- Nate.
- Nate!

69
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,627
Sorry, guys. It helps me concentrate.

70
00:04:11,629 --> 00:04:13,128
It's 3:00 in the morning.

71
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:15,264
Amaya and I were trying to sleep.

72
00:04:15,266 --> 00:04:17,432
Not together.

73
00:04:17,434 --> 00:04:19,768
- What are you doing up so late?
- Just trying to figure out

74
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:22,537
what the Legion of Doom
wants with those two amulets.

75
00:04:22,539 --> 00:04:24,306
The “Legion of Doom”?

76
00:04:24,308 --> 00:04:27,309
Darhk, Merlyn, and the Speedster.

77
00:04:27,311 --> 00:04:28,877
It's from a Hanna-Barbera cartoon

78
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:31,747
I liked when I was a kid.
Sorry I woke you guys up.

79
00:04:31,749 --> 00:04:34,249
- We... We weren't together.
- He knows, Ray.

80
00:04:34,251 --> 00:04:35,323
Yeah.

81
00:04:35,348 --> 00:04:37,185
Well, have you figured anything out?

82
00:04:37,187 --> 00:04:38,987
Well, I carbon dated
the amulet that Sara

83
00:04:38,989 --> 00:04:41,990
- took from Darhk in 1987.
- Before she gave it back

84
00:04:41,992 --> 00:04:43,725
to the Legion of Doom, I'm guessing.

85
00:04:43,727 --> 00:04:46,995
Yeah, and Gideon puts
the amulet's date of origin

86
00:04:46,997 --> 00:04:48,697
around 30 A.D.

87
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:52,134
Huh, high concentrations of
manganese, copper, and zinc,

88
00:04:52,136 --> 00:04:54,202
- which would make bronze.
- Correct.

89
00:04:54,204 --> 00:04:57,472
Now, Roman Centurions put
bronze in all their metalwork

90
00:04:57,474 --> 00:04:59,875
circa 30 A.D. I also sketched

91
00:04:59,877 --> 00:05:02,277
the two amulets the
best I could from memory,

92
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:04,746
but they don't match
any artifacts on record.

93
00:05:07,484 --> 00:05:09,818
What if they're not two artifacts?

94
00:05:14,258 --> 00:05:15,791
What if they're one?

95
00:05:18,429 --> 00:05:20,896
Shut up.

96
00:05:24,068 --> 00:05:26,535
The Longinus Medallion.

97
00:05:26,537 --> 00:05:27,836
Huh.

98
00:05:27,838 --> 00:05:30,138
Longinus is the name
generally associated

99
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:32,374
with the Roman Centurion who
pierced the side of Christ

100
00:05:32,376 --> 00:05:33,742
during the Crucifixion.

101
00:05:33,744 --> 00:05:36,712
Yeah, he was blind and
got the blood of Jesus

102
00:05:36,714 --> 00:05:38,146
in his eyes, and then
he could see again.

103
00:05:38,148 --> 00:05:40,849
- Look at you.
- What? I went to Sunday school.

104
00:05:40,851 --> 00:05:43,518
Now that blood allegedly
got on the medallion

105
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,379
and empowered it and the
spear with magical powers.

106
00:05:47,404 --> 00:05:48,703
Well, why does the Legion of Doom

107
00:05:48,705 --> 00:05:51,105
- want the medallion?
- “Legion of Doom”?

108
00:05:51,107 --> 00:05:52,674
- Yeah.
- Don't ask.

109
00:05:52,676 --> 00:05:55,376
Well, according to legend,
the medallion calls for

110
00:05:55,378 --> 00:05:57,612
the spear and basically
takes you right to it.

111
00:05:57,614 --> 00:06:00,281
The spear is also
known as the Holy Lance

112
00:06:00,283 --> 00:06:01,616
or the Spear of Destiny.

113
00:06:01,618 --> 00:06:03,284
Hey, hold on, this all just sounds like

114
00:06:03,286 --> 00:06:04,986
an Indiana Jones movie.

115
00:06:04,988 --> 00:06:07,422
“Raiders of the Lost Ark” is
the reason I became a historian.

116
00:06:07,424 --> 00:06:09,824
- Did you know that?
- Okay, so the Legion

117
00:06:09,826 --> 00:06:12,227
wanted the medallion so
they could get the spear.

118
00:06:12,229 --> 00:06:13,895
But what do they want with the spear?

119
00:06:13,897 --> 00:06:16,764
Well, the spear allegedly has the power

120
00:06:16,766 --> 00:06:18,533
to rewrite reality.

121
00:06:18,535 --> 00:06:20,502
But how's that different
from us traveling through time

122
00:06:20,504 --> 00:06:22,136
and making changes to history?

123
00:06:22,138 --> 00:06:25,206
Changes to history cause
timequakes and aberrations,

124
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:29,644
which we can undo. Changes
to reality, however,

125
00:06:29,646 --> 00:06:31,212
those are permanent.

126
00:06:31,214 --> 00:06:32,647
Great.

127
00:06:32,649 --> 00:06:35,550
And I just handed them
over the medallion.

128
00:06:35,552 --> 00:06:38,453
Whoa, in exchange for Grey's life.

129
00:06:38,455 --> 00:06:40,788
Any one of us would have made that call.

130
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:43,825
Would Rip?

131
00:06:46,786 --> 00:06:50,362
_

132
00:06:52,402 --> 00:06:53,735
So much for sunny California.

133
00:06:53,737 --> 00:06:55,103
Wh-we're done here, we need to go

134
00:06:55,105 --> 00:06:57,305
to the 1600 block of Vine Street.

135
00:06:57,307 --> 00:06:59,274
- Why, pray tell?
- It's where Frank Sinatra's

136
00:06:59,276 --> 00:07:01,843
star is on the Walk of Fame.
I have always wanted to see it.

137
00:07:01,845 --> 00:07:03,144
I'm not sure if that's part of

138
00:07:03,146 --> 00:07:04,846
our little trinket's itinerary.

139
00:07:04,848 --> 00:07:07,916
I said “when we're done.”
As far as magical artifacts go,

140
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:10,752
this one is frustratingly unspecific.

141
00:07:10,754 --> 00:07:12,787
Actually, like most magical artifacts,

142
00:07:12,789 --> 00:07:14,222
its ways are nuanced.

143
00:07:14,224 --> 00:07:16,124
That's just a fancy word for vague,

144
00:07:16,126 --> 00:07:17,659
and I'm getting tired of walking.

145
00:07:17,661 --> 00:07:19,827
True, we could use some transportation.

146
00:07:20,931 --> 00:07:24,599
Oh.

147
00:07:24,601 --> 00:07:30,204
- Oh, wow.
- Afternoon, fellas.

148
00:07:30,206 --> 00:07:32,307
Not so fast, buddy.

149
00:07:32,309 --> 00:07:35,710
Wallets. Now.

150
00:07:35,712 --> 00:07:38,479
- Just give us your motorcycles.
- Excuse me?

151
00:07:38,481 --> 00:07:42,684
Give us the bikes,
and we'll let you live.

152
00:07:42,686 --> 00:07:44,786
What are you, some sort
of comedians or something?

153
00:07:44,788 --> 00:07:47,288
Or something.

154
00:07:48,525 --> 00:07:50,625
That charming-looking
fellow is Cal DeVito.

155
00:07:50,627 --> 00:07:52,460
Instead of being killed,
he's supposed to go on

156
00:07:52,462 --> 00:07:55,496
to invent a new carburetor
for shovelhead motorcycles.

157
00:07:55,498 --> 00:07:57,432
As far as aberrations go,
don't you think that's a bit...

158
00:07:57,434 --> 00:07:59,100
Puny? Yeah.

159
00:07:59,102 --> 00:08:01,636
Well, Gideon was going over
autopsy reports, and, well,

160
00:08:01,638 --> 00:08:03,338
I'll just let her tell you. Gideon?

161
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,506
Both gentlemen were
killed in close quarters

162
00:08:05,508 --> 00:08:07,575
with sezuki strikes to
the xiphoid processes

163
00:08:07,577 --> 00:08:08,776
of their sternums.

164
00:08:08,778 --> 00:08:10,912
A League of Assassins technique.

165
00:08:10,914 --> 00:08:12,947
Weren't Darhk and Merlyn former LOA?

166
00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:15,249
They must be getting
closer to the Holy Lance.

167
00:08:15,251 --> 00:08:16,884
I'm leaning toward Spear of Destiny.

168
00:08:16,886 --> 00:08:19,320
- I prefer Holy Lance.
- Can't imagine why.

169
00:08:19,322 --> 00:08:21,456
Gideon, plot a course
for the point of origin

170
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:22,924
of the aberration.

171
00:08:22,926 --> 00:08:26,361
I already have, Captain.
Hollywood, 1967.

172
00:08:26,363 --> 00:08:27,762
Is the professor all right?

173
00:08:27,764 --> 00:08:30,431
Uh, depends on what you
mean by “all right.”

174
00:08:30,433 --> 00:08:31,833
He's helping Mick with something.

175
00:08:31,835 --> 00:08:33,201
I don't know. He's being kind of

176
00:08:33,203 --> 00:08:34,469
quiet about it.

177
00:08:34,471 --> 00:08:35,903
Well, I hope he figures it out soon,

178
00:08:35,905 --> 00:08:37,472
'cause if the Legion of Doom is here...

179
00:08:37,474 --> 00:08:38,940
Really like how the name's catching on.

180
00:08:38,942 --> 00:08:40,475
We're gonna need Mick and Firestorm.

181
00:08:40,477 --> 00:08:43,111
Let's figure out what's going on first.

182
00:08:43,113 --> 00:08:45,980
Look, all I know is
Gideon said the motorcycles

183
00:08:45,982 --> 00:08:47,615
Darhk and Merlyn stole are here.

184
00:08:47,617 --> 00:08:49,283
What, so we're just
supposed to walk around

185
00:08:49,285 --> 00:08:51,386
until we see a sign that
says, “this way”?

186
00:08:51,388 --> 00:08:53,021
Good idea.

187
00:08:54,282 --> 00:08:55,834
_

188
00:08:55,859 --> 00:08:59,327
Subjugating the world to
your rule isn't saving it.

189
00:08:59,329 --> 00:09:02,130
You would create a
wasteland, and call it peace.

190
00:09:02,132 --> 00:09:04,966
Do not misquote Tacitus to me.

191
00:09:04,968 --> 00:09:06,934
I knew him well. I lived long enough

192
00:09:06,936 --> 00:09:09,537
to watch civilizations rise and fall...

193
00:09:09,539 --> 00:09:12,640
Cut, just stop. Cut, please.

194
00:09:12,642 --> 00:09:14,409
All right, cut.

195
00:09:14,411 --> 00:09:18,046
And everyone take five.

196
00:09:19,482 --> 00:09:23,484
I just need to... think.

197
00:09:26,028 --> 00:09:27,461
George.

198
00:09:28,558 --> 00:09:29,891
What do I do?

199
00:09:29,893 --> 00:09:31,759
- I mean, it wasn't that bad.
- What?

200
00:09:31,761 --> 00:09:33,461
You saw him. I just can't seem

201
00:09:33,463 --> 00:09:37,031
to get Peter to bring
any menace to the part.

202
00:09:37,033 --> 00:09:38,833
- I may need to recast.
- No, no, no.

203
00:09:38,835 --> 00:09:40,368
You don't have time to recast, okay?

204
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:42,203
Your thesis film is due
in less than a month.

205
00:09:42,205 --> 00:09:44,772
I know, I know, but a film is only

206
00:09:44,774 --> 00:09:47,542
as good as its villain,
and I have an antagonist

207
00:09:47,544 --> 00:09:50,611
who is as threatening as a wiener dog.

208
00:09:50,613 --> 00:09:52,146
Rip Hunter.

209
00:09:52,148 --> 00:09:54,248
No, I'm the director.
Rip's being played

210
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:57,251
by Adam Glassman. He's
probably at craft services.

211
00:09:57,253 --> 00:09:58,686
It's nice to see your reputation

212
00:09:58,688 --> 00:10:00,354
for dry humor is well-earned.

213
00:10:00,356 --> 00:10:02,123
You see, this is what I am talking about.

214
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:03,424
You guys are good.

215
00:10:03,426 --> 00:10:04,759
Yeah, these are...
These are great props.

216
00:10:04,761 --> 00:10:05,993
Did you make these yourself?

217
00:10:05,995 --> 00:10:07,824
Hey, we are on something of a clock here.

218
00:10:07,849 --> 00:10:10,364
Oh, my God. It's Rip.

219
00:10:10,366 --> 00:10:12,333
Don't worry. We got you, Rip.

220
00:10:13,603 --> 00:10:15,002
Who the hell are you guys?

221
00:10:15,004 --> 00:10:16,070
We don't have time for this.

222
00:10:27,317 --> 00:10:28,716
Get out of here. Save yourself.

223
00:10:28,718 --> 00:10:30,418
- No, what about you?
- I can't leave

224
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,686
my film in there.

225
00:10:34,157 --> 00:10:35,790
Get out of here, man! No film is worth

226
00:10:35,792 --> 00:10:37,992
losing your life!

227
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:44,365
Get Rip out of here.

228
00:10:44,367 --> 00:10:45,700
Hey, come on, we gotta go.

229
00:10:45,702 --> 00:10:47,802
Get... away... from... me.

230
00:10:47,804 --> 00:10:50,204
What the hell, man?

231
00:10:53,176 --> 00:10:54,809
Fall back.

232
00:10:54,811 --> 00:10:56,544
- Stay right there!
- Hands! Hands!

233
00:10:56,546 --> 00:10:57,812
Freeze! Don't move!

234
00:10:57,814 --> 00:10:59,347
- Hey.
- Whoa, where do you think

235
00:10:59,372 --> 00:11:00,714
- you're going?
- Uh, my movie's inside.

236
00:11:00,738 --> 00:11:02,717
- These lunatics just showed up.
- Do you know these people?

237
00:11:02,719 --> 00:11:04,085
- No, no, no, I...
- Against the wall, long hair.

238
00:11:04,087 --> 00:11:05,486
What? No, but my movie...

239
00:11:05,488 --> 00:11:07,388
Can wait. You're under arrest.

240
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:12,360
What? Oh, my God, oh, my God.

241
00:11:16,415 --> 00:11:19,489
Well, that went apocalyptically awful.

242
00:11:19,491 --> 00:11:21,091
I got Nate and Amaya researching where

243
00:11:21,093 --> 00:11:23,560
the police took Rip. We'll
spring him, and then...

244
00:11:23,562 --> 00:11:26,063
We'll find out what the
hell is going on with him.

245
00:11:26,065 --> 00:11:30,367
Dude tried to bludgeon me
with this... non-lethal weapon.

246
00:11:30,369 --> 00:11:32,336
Look, we don't know
how long he was in 1967.

247
00:11:32,338 --> 00:11:33,904
He could be suffering from time drift,

248
00:11:33,906 --> 00:11:35,305
which is why he doesn't remember us.

249
00:11:35,307 --> 00:11:37,341
The question is how?

250
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:39,009
Well, he could have
time-scattered himself

251
00:11:39,011 --> 00:11:40,611
like he did with us.

252
00:11:40,613 --> 00:11:43,780
Nah, he sent us his final
message after scattering us.

253
00:11:43,782 --> 00:11:45,644
He wouldn't have been able
to use it for a second time.

254
00:11:45,668 --> 00:11:48,785
Well, he got here somehow
and so did Darhk and Merlyn.

255
00:11:48,787 --> 00:11:51,455
- The Legion of Doom.
- I'm not calling them that.

256
00:11:51,457 --> 00:11:53,924
- Okay.
- But if they came to 1967

257
00:11:53,926 --> 00:11:56,093
looking for Rip, that means...

258
00:11:56,095 --> 00:11:58,295
The medallion must have led them there.

259
00:11:58,297 --> 00:12:00,063
Rip has the Spear of Destiny.

260
00:12:00,065 --> 00:12:03,700
We gotta bust him out of jail
before they get to him first.

261
00:12:03,702 --> 00:12:05,636
And ever since, I've had...

262
00:12:05,638 --> 00:12:08,305
the fear of giant toads.

263
00:12:08,307 --> 00:12:12,276
Mr. Rory, while I appreciate
the thoroughness of insights,

264
00:12:12,278 --> 00:12:15,712
perhaps we could focus
on the issue at hand.

265
00:12:15,714 --> 00:12:18,115
I thought shrinks liked mommy talk.

266
00:12:18,117 --> 00:12:19,750
I'm not a shr...

267
00:12:19,752 --> 00:12:23,320
You know, I think I've
heard enough on that subject.

268
00:12:23,322 --> 00:12:27,324
Now, when did you first
encounter the apparition?

269
00:12:27,326 --> 00:12:31,695
The ghost of Mr. Snart,
when did he first appear?

270
00:12:31,697 --> 00:12:33,630
Back in Chicago.

271
00:12:33,632 --> 00:12:35,299
Can you remember anything specific?

272
00:12:35,301 --> 00:12:37,367
Something that might
have triggered the vision?

273
00:12:37,369 --> 00:12:39,970
He said something
about setting me straight.

274
00:12:39,972 --> 00:12:41,338
Why do you think he'd say that?

275
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,173
I don't know. Maybe he's...

276
00:12:45,511 --> 00:12:46,743
Captain, hello.

277
00:12:46,745 --> 00:12:48,946
How... What can we do for you?

278
00:12:48,948 --> 00:12:52,015
It's Rip. Here's here in 1967.

279
00:12:52,017 --> 00:12:53,650
That's astonishing. How?

280
00:12:53,652 --> 00:12:54,985
We don't know, but Damien Darhk

281
00:12:54,987 --> 00:12:56,486
and Malcolm Merlyn are after him,

282
00:12:56,488 --> 00:12:58,488
which means you two
cannot sit this one out.

283
00:12:58,490 --> 00:12:59,990
Of course, my apologies.
I was just helping

284
00:12:59,992 --> 00:13:04,394
Mr. Rory with his... migraine.

285
00:13:04,396 --> 00:13:07,297
Yes, I... I have a very bad headache.

286
00:13:07,299 --> 00:13:08,932
Well, you're gonna have to suck it up,

287
00:13:08,934 --> 00:13:11,368
'cause I need your help
breaking Rip out of jail.

288
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:12,314
What's he doing in prison?

289
00:13:12,338 --> 00:13:14,110
And how do you plan on breaking him out?

290
00:13:14,135 --> 00:13:15,501
It involves you playing a shrink.

291
00:13:15,526 --> 00:13:17,321
Do you think you can do it?

292
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:21,812
- If I must.
- Great.

293
00:13:34,793 --> 00:13:36,727
Good day.

294
00:13:36,729 --> 00:13:38,462
Can I help you?

295
00:13:38,464 --> 00:13:41,798
Yes, I believe you have
one of my patients in custody.

296
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,034
Name?

297
00:13:44,036 --> 00:13:46,003
His name...

298
00:13:47,442 --> 00:13:49,141
Gideon, a little help?

299
00:13:49,143 --> 00:13:52,545
According to his mug shot, he
was booked as “Phil Gasmer”"

300
00:13:52,547 --> 00:13:55,181
Phillip Gasmer.

301
00:13:55,183 --> 00:13:57,016
It's imperative that he be released

302
00:13:57,018 --> 00:13:58,417
into my custody immediately.

303
00:13:58,419 --> 00:14:01,387
He suffers from
delusions of being pursued

304
00:14:01,389 --> 00:14:03,456
by futuristic spacemen.

305
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:06,425
Oh, yeah. That guy.

306
00:14:06,427 --> 00:14:08,995
This way.

307
00:14:14,936 --> 00:14:18,437
Astonishing. It's really you.

308
00:14:18,439 --> 00:14:21,274
Yeah, it's me. Who are you?

309
00:14:21,276 --> 00:14:26,612
I'm your doctor, Mr. Gasmer.
I'm here to take care of you.

310
00:14:26,614 --> 00:14:30,049
I have never laid eyes
on you before in my life.

311
00:14:30,051 --> 00:14:32,218
Memory problems are
a part of the delusion.

312
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:36,555
I'll have to admit him.
He can't be treated here.

313
00:14:36,557 --> 00:14:41,127
No, don't leave! This
man is not my doctor.

314
00:14:41,129 --> 00:14:42,461
I am not crazy!

315
00:14:42,463 --> 00:14:44,430
Hey, I know, I know. It's okay.

316
00:14:44,432 --> 00:14:46,799
Look, my name is Sara
Lance. This is Mick Rory

317
00:14:46,801 --> 00:14:49,902
and Martin Stein. We're your friends.

318
00:14:49,904 --> 00:14:53,706
- Two of them are.
- You're one of them.

319
00:14:54,676 --> 00:14:56,175
Help!

320
00:14:56,177 --> 00:14:59,178
- Hey, okay, hey, hey, hey.
- Help! Help!

321
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,414
Listen to me, all right? Calm down.

322
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:04,150
We're here to help
you. You gotta trust me.

323
00:15:04,152 --> 00:15:08,154
- Your name is Rip Hunter.
- Rip Hunter is a figment

324
00:15:08,156 --> 00:15:11,424
of my imagination. Help!

325
00:15:11,426 --> 00:15:12,558
Mick.

326
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,933
We've got Rip.

327
00:15:20,935 --> 00:15:23,769
We're headed for the extraction point.

328
00:15:23,771 --> 00:15:27,540
- Oh, no.
- What is it?

329
00:15:27,542 --> 00:15:28,975
Oh.

330
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,379
Can I help you?

331
00:15:35,249 --> 00:15:38,517
Hey.

332
00:15:43,725 --> 00:15:46,359
Sara, you got incoming. Darhk and Merlyn

333
00:15:46,361 --> 00:15:48,427
just entered the precinct.

334
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,500
Yeah, I see them. They're
blocking our escape.

335
00:15:54,502 --> 00:15:56,068
There must be another way out.

336
00:15:59,907 --> 00:16:02,408
Ray, how well can you fly the Waverider?

337
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:04,076
Thought you'd never ask.

338
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,712
Wait, you know how to fly the ship?

339
00:16:06,714 --> 00:16:08,447
Sure do. I just have to channel

340
00:16:08,449 --> 00:16:10,416
my inner Han Solo.

341
00:16:10,418 --> 00:16:12,418
- Gideon does most of the work.
- She does?

342
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,086
- I do.
- Huh.

343
00:16:14,088 --> 00:16:15,788
Where to, Cap?

344
00:16:22,508 --> 00:16:24,163
All right, we're here.

345
00:16:24,165 --> 00:16:26,332
Get to the cargo bay.

346
00:16:27,969 --> 00:16:31,237
Ray, do not crash my ship.
You break it, you buy it.

347
00:16:41,883 --> 00:16:43,949
- Get away from me.
- Captain Hunter,

348
00:16:43,951 --> 00:16:46,419
- you must listen to us.
- Why do you keep

349
00:16:46,421 --> 00:16:50,122
calling me that? Is
this some kind of joke?

350
00:16:50,124 --> 00:16:52,625
Rip, just calm down, okay?
We need you to remember.

351
00:16:52,627 --> 00:16:57,063
Your name is Rip Hunter.
You are a Time Master.

352
00:16:57,065 --> 00:16:59,832
You fly the Waverider. It's a timeship.

353
00:16:59,834 --> 00:17:03,636
Rip! Rip, just wait.

354
00:17:12,313 --> 00:17:16,415
This cannot be happening.
You're... Am I dreaming?

355
00:17:16,417 --> 00:17:19,318
- Rip?
- Ooh, God.

356
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,954
Did I drop some really bad acid?

357
00:17:21,956 --> 00:17:24,290
- Rip, be careful.
- Why?

358
00:17:24,292 --> 00:17:27,159
I'm hallucinating.
There is no such thing

359
00:17:27,161 --> 00:17:30,729
as Rip Hunter, and there's no such thing

360
00:17:30,731 --> 00:17:32,064
as a timeship.

361
00:17:35,069 --> 00:17:36,902
There's a...

362
00:17:40,842 --> 00:17:43,309
Get to the ship. Go!

363
00:17:47,705 --> 00:17:49,248
- Let's go!
- Guys, come on!

364
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:52,017
- Quick! Get on!
- Let's go!

365
00:18:04,488 --> 00:18:06,155
Well, Gideon?

366
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,189
I'm afraid the news isn't good, Captain.

367
00:18:08,214 --> 00:18:10,118
A deep scan reveals
that Captain Hunter's

368
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,587
neural architecture has
been completely restructured.

369
00:18:12,589 --> 00:18:15,056
His limbic system reprogrammed
with a new identity.

370
00:18:15,058 --> 00:18:18,160
So it isn't time drift.

371
00:18:18,162 --> 00:18:22,731
Rip didn't forget who
he was. He... changed.

372
00:18:22,733 --> 00:18:25,200
Reprogrammed? The technology to alter

373
00:18:25,202 --> 00:18:28,170
the brain at that level
doesn't even exist.

374
00:18:28,172 --> 00:18:31,273
Unless Rip's brain was
somehow altered by impulses

375
00:18:31,275 --> 00:18:34,075
from the... uh... From the...

376
00:18:34,077 --> 00:18:36,778
- From the ship's time drive?
- Uh, yeah.

377
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:39,014
You're talking temporal electrocution.

378
00:18:39,016 --> 00:18:42,117
As a method of time travel,
it's practically suicidal.

379
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:44,286
Does that track?

380
00:18:44,288 --> 00:18:48,390
Uh, I'm not sure. Excuse me.

381
00:18:48,392 --> 00:18:51,960
- What's his problem?
- I don't know.

382
00:18:51,962 --> 00:18:53,895
Captain Hunter must
have shut down my systems

383
00:18:53,897 --> 00:18:55,530
because he knew I would never permit him

384
00:18:55,532 --> 00:18:58,066
to make physical contact
with the time drive.

385
00:18:58,068 --> 00:18:59,968
For good reason. He could
have ended up anywhere

386
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:01,670
and in any period in time.

387
00:19:01,672 --> 00:19:03,038
But before he deactivated me,

388
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,773
he recovered something from his parlor.

389
00:19:04,775 --> 00:19:07,909
A piece of wood
approximately 0.6 meters long.

390
00:19:07,911 --> 00:19:09,110
A piece of wood?

391
00:19:09,112 --> 00:19:13,882
- The Spear of Destiny?
- Could be.

392
00:19:13,884 --> 00:19:15,817
I'm gonna go tell the others.

393
00:19:19,089 --> 00:19:20,856
I got an idea.

394
00:19:20,858 --> 00:19:25,193
So this would be a new
milestone for you then.

395
00:19:25,195 --> 00:19:27,128
What's your idea?

396
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:30,065
Why don't we use that thing
to see what's up with my brain?

397
00:19:30,067 --> 00:19:33,535
I doubt you'd find the
results you're hoping for.

398
00:19:33,537 --> 00:19:35,837
These tests are meant to
find neurological changes,

399
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:38,907
while my theory is that your visions

400
00:19:38,909 --> 00:19:42,043
are the result of emotion.

401
00:19:42,045 --> 00:19:43,545
You saying I'm crazy?

402
00:19:43,547 --> 00:19:46,414
I'm saying you're feeling something,

403
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:48,550
and in the wake of
your partner's demise,

404
00:19:48,552 --> 00:19:50,285
that's perfectly normal.

405
00:19:50,287 --> 00:19:55,390
I don't do feelings.
Run the test, fix my brain.

406
00:19:55,392 --> 00:19:57,192
Hey, what's up?

407
00:19:57,194 --> 00:19:59,327
Sara asked us to find
any physical descriptions

408
00:19:59,329 --> 00:20:01,196
of the spear that might help us find it.

409
00:20:01,198 --> 00:20:04,099
She thinks Rip had it with
him when he traveled to 1967.

410
00:20:04,101 --> 00:20:06,568
And she, um, also wants you to work on

411
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:09,237
figuring out, um, a way to reverse

412
00:20:09,239 --> 00:20:11,706
the effects, uh, on Rip

413
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:14,309
since he came in contact with the, um...

414
00:20:14,311 --> 00:20:16,444
Time drive.

415
00:20:16,446 --> 00:20:18,079
I've brought up the
time drive's schematics

416
00:20:18,081 --> 00:20:20,882
for you, Dr. Palmer.

417
00:20:20,884 --> 00:20:23,218
Well, how do you expect me
to understand any of that?

418
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:26,187
Uh, maybe using one of your four PhDs?

419
00:20:26,189 --> 00:20:30,458
- I don't have four...
- What's wrong?

420
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:34,062
It's like I should have
memories that aren't there,

421
00:20:34,064 --> 00:20:37,299
and I should understand
what this is, but I don't.

422
00:20:37,301 --> 00:20:39,901
Yeah, I feel it, too,
it's happening right now.

423
00:20:39,903 --> 00:20:43,004
I'm reading this book about
“Santarion Long-inises,”

424
00:20:43,006 --> 00:20:45,941
and it's just a bunch of words.

425
00:20:45,943 --> 00:20:48,176
How long have the two of
you been feeling like this?

426
00:20:50,314 --> 00:20:54,182
Since, uh... Film set.

427
00:20:54,184 --> 00:20:56,418
- Mr. Hunter's film.
- Mm-hmm.

428
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:59,654
Sara had Jax go and
recover what he could find.

429
00:20:59,656 --> 00:21:02,290
“Glucas.” Wait, isn't that what

430
00:21:02,292 --> 00:21:03,825
you pretend you're allergic to, Ray?

431
00:21:03,827 --> 00:21:06,561
What? First of all, my gluten allergy

432
00:21:06,563 --> 00:21:08,096
is very real and challenging.

433
00:21:08,098 --> 00:21:12,834
Secondly, it's G. Lucas,
as in George Lucas.

434
00:21:12,836 --> 00:21:14,536
Wait. George Lucas.

435
00:21:14,538 --> 00:21:16,605
How do I know that name?

436
00:21:16,607 --> 00:21:20,308
Gideon, pull up George
Lucas on the historical record.

437
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:22,477
George Lucas, born
in Modesto, California

438
00:21:22,479 --> 00:21:25,580
on May 14th, 1944.
Named Modesto Hartman's

439
00:21:25,582 --> 00:21:27,482
“Insurance Salesman of the Year”

440
00:21:27,484 --> 00:21:30,685
in 1977, 1980, and 1983.

441
00:21:30,687 --> 00:21:34,489
- Three years, hmm.
- That doesn't seem right.

442
00:21:34,491 --> 00:21:37,492
No.

443
00:21:37,494 --> 00:21:40,095
Gideon, is there a version of history

444
00:21:40,097 --> 00:21:43,365
where Mr. Lucas did
something else with his life?

445
00:21:43,367 --> 00:21:46,568
Apparently this Mr.
Lucas is an aberration.

446
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:48,536
He's not the aberration.
The Legion of Doom

447
00:21:48,538 --> 00:21:49,971
scaring him is the aberration.

448
00:21:49,973 --> 00:21:51,706
An aberration that
directly affects our lives.

449
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:55,510
Okay, calm down. Take it back.

450
00:21:55,512 --> 00:21:57,245
Gideon thinks that the Legion's attack

451
00:21:57,247 --> 00:21:58,780
on Mr. Hunter's film set caused

452
00:21:58,782 --> 00:22:01,149
this George Lucas guy
to quit movie making.

453
00:22:01,151 --> 00:22:03,118
As a result, he never
made some movie about

454
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,452
space battles or another one about

455
00:22:04,454 --> 00:22:06,354
an improbably handsome archaeologist.

456
00:22:06,356 --> 00:22:08,089
And we care about this because...?

457
00:22:08,091 --> 00:22:11,092
In the unaltered timeline,
Dr. Palmer sees “Star Wars”

458
00:22:11,094 --> 00:22:13,828
as a child, and is inspired
to become an inventor.

459
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:16,464
Likewise, Dr. Heywood
chooses to be a historian

460
00:22:16,466 --> 00:22:19,134
after seeing “Indiana
Jones” instead of becoming

461
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:21,002
a yoga instructor.

462
00:22:21,004 --> 00:22:23,171
- Oh, man.
- Wait, so you're telling me

463
00:22:23,173 --> 00:22:25,640
that because some film
geek drops out of school,

464
00:22:25,642 --> 00:22:28,943
my inventor and my historian
are now essentially useless?

465
00:22:28,945 --> 00:22:30,445
- Yes.
- Hey!

466
00:22:30,447 --> 00:22:33,014
If the aberration is not corrected, yes.

467
00:22:33,016 --> 00:22:35,350
We need to fix this now.

468
00:22:35,352 --> 00:22:37,719
I fear you may already be too late.

469
00:22:37,721 --> 00:22:40,355
As of today, George Lucas
is no longer enrolled

470
00:22:40,357 --> 00:22:41,656
in film school.

471
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,066
There he is.

472
00:23:10,068 --> 00:23:11,668
George Lucas, the man who inspires

473
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:13,870
both of our careers, supposedly.

474
00:23:13,872 --> 00:23:17,073
- Well, let's go inspire him.
- Guys, maybe I should do the...

475
00:23:17,075 --> 00:23:19,109
Hey, George. Remember us?

476
00:23:19,111 --> 00:23:20,410
- Hey!
- I had metallic skin.

477
00:23:20,412 --> 00:23:21,711
- No, no.
- Hey...

478
00:23:21,713 --> 00:23:23,647
- No, no, no, no.
- Look, time takes

479
00:23:23,649 --> 00:23:25,315
time to harden, and sooner or later,

480
00:23:25,317 --> 00:23:27,017
we're gonna lose our
superpowers the same way

481
00:23:27,019 --> 00:23:28,652
we're losing our memories.

482
00:23:28,654 --> 00:23:30,654
If you don't make the
movies that you make,

483
00:23:30,656 --> 00:23:32,422
I don't become a brilliant inventor.

484
00:23:32,424 --> 00:23:35,292
And I don't become an
incredibly handsome historian.

485
00:23:35,294 --> 00:23:37,527
I haven't made any movies yet, okay?

486
00:23:37,529 --> 00:23:41,097
I'm still in film school. Or I was.

487
00:23:41,099 --> 00:23:43,934
That's the point. If you
don't go back to school,

488
00:23:43,936 --> 00:23:45,402
you screw up both of our lives.

489
00:23:45,404 --> 00:23:46,937
We don't live up to our full potential.

490
00:23:46,939 --> 00:23:48,505
And I do not want to be a heart surgeon.

491
00:23:48,507 --> 00:23:50,340
And I don't want to
be a yoga instructor.

492
00:23:50,342 --> 00:23:52,976
Okay, guys, like I
said, why don't I talk to

493
00:23:52,978 --> 00:23:54,444
- our time aberration?
- Yeah, but...

494
00:23:54,446 --> 00:23:57,314
- Shh.
- Stay in school.

495
00:24:01,301 --> 00:24:02,986
I'm sorry about my
friends, they're just...

496
00:24:02,988 --> 00:24:06,456
- Completely insane?
- Yeah.

497
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:08,825
But what they say is true.

498
00:24:08,827 --> 00:24:11,494
Oh, okay, what... What that you guys

499
00:24:11,496 --> 00:24:14,698
are from the future,
that you've somehow seen

500
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,466
a bunch of movies that
I haven't even made yet?

501
00:24:16,468 --> 00:24:18,168
Well, actually, I'm from the past,

502
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:20,236
but that's beside the point.

503
00:24:20,238 --> 00:24:23,573
Look, George, I don't care about movies,

504
00:24:23,575 --> 00:24:26,276
but guys like them?

505
00:24:26,278 --> 00:24:28,266
They do.

506
00:24:28,291 --> 00:24:31,047
So before you get in that
car and drive back to Modesto,

507
00:24:31,049 --> 00:24:33,416
just think about them, okay?

508
00:24:33,418 --> 00:24:35,185
Them, and all the
millions of other people

509
00:24:35,187 --> 00:24:38,221
that your stories will someday inspire.

510
00:24:38,223 --> 00:24:42,225
The future of the
entire world is at stake.

511
00:24:42,227 --> 00:24:44,527
And you're our only hope.

512
00:24:48,333 --> 00:24:51,234
I've never actually seen
your quarters, Mr. Rory.

513
00:24:51,236 --> 00:24:54,004
They're charming.

514
00:24:54,006 --> 00:24:56,539
- Oh, my God.
- What is it?

515
00:24:56,541 --> 00:24:59,509
Something unusual,
some sort of receiver.

516
00:24:59,511 --> 00:25:02,379
Judging by its design, one sensitive

517
00:25:02,381 --> 00:25:04,647
to gravitation-wave transmissions.

518
00:25:04,649 --> 00:25:07,717
You're telling me I
have an antenna in my head.

519
00:25:07,719 --> 00:25:10,053
Well, the good news is you're not crazy.

520
00:25:10,055 --> 00:25:11,429
Oh, really?

521
00:25:11,454 --> 00:25:14,190
So, seeing and talking to Snart's real?

522
00:25:14,192 --> 00:25:17,127
Well, in a sense,
yes. Your former partner

523
00:25:17,129 --> 00:25:19,696
was killed when the Oculus exploded

524
00:25:19,698 --> 00:25:21,231
in a blast of temporal energy.

525
00:25:21,233 --> 00:25:25,368
Now, if Mr. Snart was able
to bond with that blast,

526
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:28,071
the version of him you're
now seeing could be...

527
00:25:28,073 --> 00:25:30,540
Um, how will I put this?

528
00:25:30,542 --> 00:25:34,077
- Like a time-ghost?
- Precisely.

529
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:36,112
But what I want to know
is how did someone manage

530
00:25:36,114 --> 00:25:39,115
to put a device inside your brain

531
00:25:39,117 --> 00:25:41,217
without you knowing it?

532
00:25:41,219 --> 00:25:43,887
You are Chronos.

533
00:25:43,889 --> 00:25:46,089
The Time Masters.

534
00:25:46,091 --> 00:25:50,493
They did some sick things
to me when I was Chronos.

535
00:25:50,495 --> 00:25:53,196
I'm sorry, I forgot.

536
00:25:53,198 --> 00:25:55,565
So what you're saying
is Snart's stuck out there,

537
00:25:55,567 --> 00:25:58,968
blasted into a billion
pieces, floating around

538
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:00,703
in time and space?

539
00:26:00,705 --> 00:26:04,541
A rather simplistic way
of looking at it, but yes.

540
00:26:04,543 --> 00:26:07,043
- You're an idiot.
- Excuse me?

541
00:26:07,045 --> 00:26:10,180
It didn't have to end like this.

542
00:26:11,716 --> 00:26:16,052
- Mr. Snart, is he here?
- “Why am I here”?

543
00:26:16,054 --> 00:26:19,489
Why are you here? You're dead.

544
00:26:19,491 --> 00:26:21,558
What's he saying?

545
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:25,662
He's telling me I've gone soft
because I'm still on the ship.

546
00:26:28,166 --> 00:26:30,400
Doc, Doc...

547
00:26:30,402 --> 00:26:32,535
you gotta get this thing out of my head.

548
00:26:32,537 --> 00:26:35,138
As I explained, I'm
not a medical doctor...

549
00:26:36,808 --> 00:26:39,409
But I'm sure Gideon and I
can figure something out.

550
00:26:39,411 --> 00:26:43,580
- That could work?
- In theory, yes.

551
00:26:50,422 --> 00:26:51,921
Huh.

552
00:26:54,759 --> 00:26:56,826
Groovy office.

553
00:26:56,828 --> 00:27:00,864
It used to be yours.

554
00:27:00,866 --> 00:27:03,366
Come on, none of this is bringing back

555
00:27:03,368 --> 00:27:05,435
- any memories for you?
- Listen, lady,

556
00:27:05,437 --> 00:27:08,705
I-I wish that I could be
the guy you want me to be.

557
00:27:08,707 --> 00:27:12,575
“Rip,” but I am not.

558
00:27:13,979 --> 00:27:17,947
I take it you two were... pretty tight?

559
00:27:17,949 --> 00:27:21,217
- Yeah, he saved my life.
- Cool.

560
00:27:21,219 --> 00:27:22,685
You.

561
00:27:22,687 --> 00:27:26,456
You saved my life. I was lost.

562
00:27:26,458 --> 00:27:29,459
You came, you recruited
me, you gave me purpose.

563
00:27:29,461 --> 00:27:34,297
Oh, it sounds like Sandra.
She's the hero of my... my movie.

564
00:27:34,299 --> 00:27:35,832
- That's weird that...
- What?

565
00:27:35,834 --> 00:27:40,170
A female hero? Get with the times, lady.

566
00:27:40,172 --> 00:27:43,106
Yo, we're all in this movie.

567
00:27:43,108 --> 00:27:44,707
I mean, it's different versions of us,

568
00:27:44,709 --> 00:27:47,343
but this is definitely the team.

569
00:27:47,345 --> 00:27:51,047
Like on, uh, page 89, my character, Max,

570
00:27:51,049 --> 00:27:52,916
- he saves everybody...
- Hold on.

571
00:27:52,918 --> 00:27:55,485
You're telling me that this
burnout used repressed memories

572
00:27:55,487 --> 00:27:58,154
- to write a screenplay?
- That's not all.

573
00:27:58,156 --> 00:28:00,323
He's writing about the Spear of Destiny.

574
00:28:00,325 --> 00:28:03,826
Which you had with you
when you time-jumped

575
00:28:03,828 --> 00:28:06,362
- off the Waverider.
- I don't know...

576
00:28:06,364 --> 00:28:08,898
- what you are talking about.
- Yes, you do.

577
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,466
- Come on, now.
- What?

578
00:28:10,468 --> 00:28:13,636
I just made it all up.
The spear is the MacGuffin.

579
00:28:13,638 --> 00:28:14,670
The what?

580
00:28:14,695 --> 00:28:16,839
The thing in the movie
that everyone's trying to get.

581
00:28:16,841 --> 00:28:19,075
- Well, where is it?
- In the movie?

582
00:28:19,077 --> 00:28:22,478
It... It's in pieces. Rip
just has a fragment of it.

583
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,316
What inspired you to write it that way?

584
00:28:26,318 --> 00:28:27,917
I don't know.

585
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:29,485
I just had this old piece of wood.

586
00:28:29,487 --> 00:28:32,288
I thought it'd be a cool movie prop.

587
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:34,023
- Where is it?
- Uh, I gave it

588
00:28:34,025 --> 00:28:40,129
- to my prop master, George.
- Oh, great.

589
00:28:40,131 --> 00:28:42,899
George Lucas has the Spear of Destiny.

590
00:28:46,671 --> 00:28:48,438
Glad you changed
your mind, George Lucas.

591
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:51,608
Going back to film school?
Definitely the right call.

592
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:52,642
We agree.

593
00:29:03,021 --> 00:29:04,687
Neat trinket. One of the lost

594
00:29:04,689 --> 00:29:07,991
totems of Zambesi, right?

595
00:29:07,993 --> 00:29:11,694
Ah, Mr. Lucas, you have something

596
00:29:11,696 --> 00:29:14,264
that we have traveled
a very long way to find.

597
00:29:14,266 --> 00:29:16,933
A piece of the Spear of Destiny.

598
00:29:16,935 --> 00:29:18,134
Where is it?

599
00:29:24,161 --> 00:29:26,733
Lady and gentlemen, if you don't mind,

600
00:29:26,735 --> 00:29:28,902
- hands up.
- And if you do mind,

601
00:29:28,904 --> 00:29:31,704
we'd be happy to kill you.

602
00:29:31,706 --> 00:29:35,575
- I'll cover George Lucas.
- And I've got...

603
00:29:35,577 --> 00:29:37,443
- What?
- It's not here.

604
00:29:37,445 --> 00:29:38,645
My suit's not here.

605
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:40,747
I can't steel up.

606
00:29:40,749 --> 00:29:42,115
Maybe I didn't make myself clear.

607
00:29:42,117 --> 00:29:43,316
Put 'em up!

608
00:29:43,318 --> 00:29:44,684
- He was talking.
- Up. Hands.

609
00:29:44,686 --> 00:29:47,387
- Shut up.
- They're up.

610
00:29:47,389 --> 00:29:49,589
Thank God. I don't think it's here.

611
00:29:49,591 --> 00:29:51,357
All right, Spec-y four-eyes. I'm starting

612
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:54,827
to lose my patience with
you. Where is the spear?

613
00:29:54,829 --> 00:29:57,096
What spear?

614
00:29:57,098 --> 00:29:59,832
We had a little chat with
the members of your film crew,

615
00:29:59,834 --> 00:30:02,068
and they all claimed the
Spear of Destiny was a prop,

616
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:04,270
and that you, Mr.
Lucas, were its master.

617
00:30:04,272 --> 00:30:06,673
But the movie was done.
I tossed all the props

618
00:30:06,675 --> 00:30:08,241
down the garbage chute.
They were just trash.

619
00:30:08,243 --> 00:30:12,178
But, but, but... Shh.

620
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:14,781
I have one question for
you, Mr. Lucas, and your life

621
00:30:14,783 --> 00:30:18,217
depends on answering me honestly.

622
00:30:20,055 --> 00:30:23,256
Where's the city dump?

623
00:30:23,258 --> 00:30:26,793
Gideon, set us down as close
to the location as you can get.

624
00:30:26,795 --> 00:30:28,294
Yes, Captain Lance.

625
00:30:28,296 --> 00:30:29,896
And, while you're
at it, find Mick and...

626
00:30:29,898 --> 00:30:31,064
Grey?

627
00:30:33,401 --> 00:30:35,735
What the hell are you doing?

628
00:30:35,737 --> 00:30:37,537
Brain surgery, what does it look like?

629
00:30:39,941 --> 00:30:41,841
- It's down there somewhere.
- Good.

630
00:30:41,843 --> 00:30:44,110
'Cause you'll never find it.

631
00:30:44,112 --> 00:30:47,480
You're right.

632
00:30:47,482 --> 00:30:50,450
You're going to.

633
00:30:57,961 --> 00:31:00,393
I could be in Modesto by now.

634
00:31:00,395 --> 00:31:02,895
Shut up and dig, George Lucas.

635
00:31:02,897 --> 00:31:05,965
What kind of superheroes
are you guys anyway, huh?

636
00:31:05,967 --> 00:31:07,767
I mean, sure, they have laser
guns, but aren't you guys

637
00:31:07,769 --> 00:31:10,637
- supposed to have superpowers?
- Well, we had superpowers,

638
00:31:10,639 --> 00:31:12,872
but, because you don't make
“Star Wars,” I don't become

639
00:31:12,874 --> 00:31:14,440
a scientist, and I
don't make the atom suit.

640
00:31:14,442 --> 00:31:16,075
Or the serum that turns me into steel.

641
00:31:16,077 --> 00:31:17,677
I can't believe we're all going to die

642
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:19,145
because of a stupid movie.

643
00:31:19,147 --> 00:31:21,314
Perhaps they need a little incentive.

644
00:31:21,316 --> 00:31:24,684
Oh, agreed.

645
00:31:24,686 --> 00:31:27,153
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

646
00:31:27,155 --> 00:31:28,554
Oh, no.

647
00:31:28,556 --> 00:31:31,124
What was that? Don't just stand there.

648
00:31:31,126 --> 00:31:34,060
- Try and brace it with something.
- Oh, no.

649
00:31:49,144 --> 00:31:51,678
- Oh, guys, I found it.
- Don't show him.

650
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,446
What? We are in a trash compactor.

651
00:31:53,448 --> 00:31:55,348
- We're going to die.
- No, Ray's right.

652
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:57,283
If we give them what they want,
they're gonna kill us anyway.

653
00:31:57,285 --> 00:31:58,851
-Okay, well, then, what do we do?

654
00:31:58,853 --> 00:32:00,820
They're going too
slow. Shoot one of them

655
00:32:00,822 --> 00:32:03,222
- to move things along.
- Which one?

656
00:32:03,224 --> 00:32:04,257
Dealer's choice.

657
00:32:13,401 --> 00:32:15,368
What was that?

658
00:32:38,526 --> 00:32:43,229
This rescue mission is
not going very well, is it?

659
00:32:43,231 --> 00:32:45,398
I'm afraid not, Captain.

660
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:48,134
Would you stop calling me that, please?

661
00:32:48,136 --> 00:32:51,504
I am not a captain.
I'm just a regular guy.

662
00:32:51,506 --> 00:32:54,273
So was Captain Hunter.
He had no superpowers,

663
00:32:54,275 --> 00:32:57,710
unless you count his
courage, intellect, and honor.

664
00:32:57,712 --> 00:33:02,081
Well, what would he do, huh?
Your Captain, if he were here?

665
00:33:07,756 --> 00:33:09,722
You guys, we... we have to give it them.

666
00:33:09,724 --> 00:33:11,357
- There's no other way.
- There is.

667
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:13,993
You have to become a filmmaker.
You have to make movies,

668
00:33:13,995 --> 00:33:16,295
and you, George Lucas,
have to believe that.

669
00:33:16,297 --> 00:33:18,030
- What?
- You have to make your movies

670
00:33:18,032 --> 00:33:19,832
so that we can become who
we're supposed to become

671
00:33:19,834 --> 00:33:21,267
so we can save you.

672
00:33:21,269 --> 00:33:22,835
Your movies go on to change the world.

673
00:33:22,837 --> 00:33:24,737
All you have to do is
believe in yourself.

674
00:33:24,739 --> 00:33:26,773
You have to believe you're
gonna make amazing movies.

675
00:33:26,775 --> 00:33:28,975
You have to believe it
like there's no tomorrow.

676
00:33:28,977 --> 00:33:30,810
Say it, George. Say it out loud.

677
00:33:30,812 --> 00:33:33,946
George Lucas, what do you really want?

678
00:33:33,948 --> 00:33:36,315
What I really want...

679
00:33:36,317 --> 00:33:38,851
What I really want...

680
00:33:38,853 --> 00:33:41,521
What I really
want is to direct!

681
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:43,856
Ahh!

682
00:33:45,894 --> 00:33:47,093
Ah!

683
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:07,814
Ahh!

684
00:34:31,973 --> 00:34:34,640
- About time you showed.
- Where were you?

685
00:34:34,642 --> 00:34:37,610
Always busy, gentleman.
And yet, never late.

686
00:34:37,612 --> 00:34:41,581
So who do we kill first?

687
00:34:41,583 --> 00:34:44,050
That would be me.

688
00:34:46,754 --> 00:34:51,090
Captain Rip Hunter. It's been ages.

689
00:34:51,092 --> 00:34:53,659
I was beginning to think you were dead.

690
00:34:53,661 --> 00:34:56,028
On the contrary, for the first time

691
00:34:56,030 --> 00:35:02,134
in recent memory, I am
finally, truly alive.

692
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,940
Oh, crap.

693
00:35:10,545 --> 00:35:12,411
Hey, does this thing work?

694
00:35:18,686 --> 00:35:21,354
Oh, screw it. Gideon!

695
00:35:21,356 --> 00:35:24,757
Fire! Fire everything!

696
00:35:28,563 --> 00:35:30,897
Go!

697
00:35:37,605 --> 00:35:39,438
Hey, come on!

698
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,574
Rip! Rip!

699
00:35:41,576 --> 00:35:43,709
- Hey, Sara!
- Rip!

700
00:35:43,711 --> 00:35:46,212
We gotta go. He's gone.

701
00:35:46,214 --> 00:35:49,115
- Gideon, get...
- Rip!

702
00:36:09,676 --> 00:36:12,277
You couldn't have got him.

703
00:36:12,279 --> 00:36:14,012
You know that, right?

704
00:36:14,014 --> 00:36:15,613
Yeah.

705
00:36:15,638 --> 00:36:20,381
Look, Sara, you can't
beat yourself up about this.

706
00:36:20,406 --> 00:36:23,207
It is my responsibility
as Captain to make sure

707
00:36:23,209 --> 00:36:25,509
that everyone gets back on this ship.

708
00:36:25,511 --> 00:36:27,544
Everyone.

709
00:36:28,429 --> 00:36:31,815
And I failed.

710
00:36:31,817 --> 00:36:33,951
You call getting a piece
of the Spear of Destiny

711
00:36:33,953 --> 00:36:37,621
and the Medallion a failure?

712
00:36:37,623 --> 00:36:40,924
The Legion have nothing.

713
00:36:40,926 --> 00:36:43,994
They have Rip. We lost him, Jax.

714
00:36:43,996 --> 00:36:45,295
Again.

715
00:36:45,297 --> 00:36:48,131
But they won't have him for long.

716
00:36:48,133 --> 00:36:52,336
If I know one thing about you,
it's that you don't give up.

717
00:36:52,338 --> 00:36:54,805
When you really want
something, you are unstoppable,

718
00:36:54,807 --> 00:36:58,408
and God help anybody that
tries to get in your way.

719
00:36:58,410 --> 00:37:02,479
We are gonna find him, and
we're gonna bring him home.

720
00:37:03,256 --> 00:37:04,990
Is that a promise?

721
00:37:07,486 --> 00:37:09,853
That's a prophecy.

722
00:37:15,394 --> 00:37:16,894
How are you feeling?

723
00:37:16,896 --> 00:37:18,962
Have you seen our mutual
friend around lately?

724
00:37:18,964 --> 00:37:20,230
No.

725
00:37:20,232 --> 00:37:22,366
That's because you took the chip out.

726
00:37:22,368 --> 00:37:25,002
Well, actually...

727
00:37:25,004 --> 00:37:26,436
You did take the chip out.

728
00:37:26,438 --> 00:37:29,339
Yes, I did, but after
further inspection,

729
00:37:29,341 --> 00:37:33,977
I discovered that the device
hasn't functioned in months.

730
00:37:33,979 --> 00:37:36,914
It seems you've taken one
too many blows to the head.

731
00:37:36,916 --> 00:37:39,583
So I am going crazy.

732
00:37:39,585 --> 00:37:41,418
I'm seeing a ghost.

733
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:43,353
There is no ghost.

734
00:37:43,355 --> 00:37:47,424
Leonard Snart truly is no more.

735
00:37:47,426 --> 00:37:51,161
Then why do I keep hearing his voice?

736
00:37:51,163 --> 00:37:54,298
That voice inside your head is your own.

737
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:57,200
If Leonard Snart is second-guessing

738
00:37:57,202 --> 00:37:59,736
your moral obligation to this team...

739
00:37:59,738 --> 00:38:02,839
But that's what I feel.

740
00:38:02,841 --> 00:38:05,943
We all hear contradictory voices

741
00:38:05,945 --> 00:38:09,012
inside our heads, Mr. Rory,
creating, what is known

742
00:38:09,014 --> 00:38:12,482
in psychology, as cognitive dissonance.

743
00:38:12,484 --> 00:38:16,954
- My brains hurts.
- Well, I'm sure it does.

744
00:38:16,956 --> 00:38:19,389
The complexities of human emotion

745
00:38:19,391 --> 00:38:23,226
can at times be mind-boggling.

746
00:38:26,398 --> 00:38:27,731
What's this?

747
00:38:27,733 --> 00:38:29,399
I thought you got your smarts back.

748
00:38:29,401 --> 00:38:31,335
- It's movie night.
- Gideon checked the timeline.

749
00:38:31,337 --> 00:38:34,237
It seems all of George's movies
are now part of history again.

750
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:37,808
Hah, I've almost forgotten how
to perform a median sternotomy.

751
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:39,276
Well, I guess I'll just go back to being

752
00:38:39,278 --> 00:38:41,979
a billionaire inventor with four PhDs.

753
00:38:41,981 --> 00:38:43,480
So what are we gonna watch first?

754
00:38:43,482 --> 00:38:45,248
I mean, after we watch “Raiders.”

755
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:48,719
- Clearly his best film.
- Which he never would've made

756
00:38:48,721 --> 00:38:49,920
if he hadn't made “Star Wars” first.

757
00:38:49,922 --> 00:38:51,188
Oh, wait, this one sounds cute.

758
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:52,656
It's called “Howard the Duck”"

759
00:38:52,658 --> 00:38:54,291
No!

760
00:38:54,293 --> 00:38:57,527
Okay, maybe movie night
wasn't such a good idea.

761
00:38:57,529 --> 00:38:59,162
Maybe you're right.

762
00:38:59,164 --> 00:39:02,599
After all, we did just lose Rip.

763
00:39:03,619 --> 00:39:05,769
I know Nate and I never
really got to know Rip,

764
00:39:05,771 --> 00:39:08,505
but we know how much he
means to the rest of you.

765
00:39:08,507 --> 00:39:10,974
- Yeah.
- Might I offer my opinion?

766
00:39:10,976 --> 00:39:12,342
Fire away.

767
00:39:12,344 --> 00:39:14,111
I believe Captain Hunter would want you

768
00:39:14,113 --> 00:39:16,380
to enjoy yourselves tonight.

769
00:39:16,382 --> 00:39:19,816
All right, then. Dim the lights.

770
00:39:19,818 --> 00:39:22,252
Gideon, pick the movie.

771
00:39:22,254 --> 00:39:24,421
We'll watch “Raiders” after.

772
00:39:24,423 --> 00:39:27,424
- Then “Empire.”
- Then “Last Crusade.”

773
00:39:27,426 --> 00:39:31,294
Get comfy. It's gonna be a long night.

774
00:39:33,532 --> 00:39:37,000
Uh...

775
00:39:37,002 --> 00:39:38,731
hello?

776
00:39:41,006 --> 00:39:42,457
Hello?

777
00:39:44,676 --> 00:39:47,110
Is anybody there?

778
00:39:48,614 --> 00:39:51,448
Hey, man.

779
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:53,116
Welcome, Captain Hunter.

780
00:39:53,118 --> 00:39:56,019
Right. You know I was bluffing, right?

781
00:39:56,021 --> 00:40:01,024
I am not actually Rip Hunter.

782
00:40:01,026 --> 00:40:04,061
My name is Phil. I am
a full-time film student

783
00:40:04,063 --> 00:40:06,997
and part-time recreational drug user.

784
00:40:06,999 --> 00:40:09,166
Seriously regretting the latter.

785
00:40:09,168 --> 00:40:12,402
Oh, I know exactly who you are.

786
00:40:12,404 --> 00:40:14,071
I know that you're one of the protectors

787
00:40:14,073 --> 00:40:17,474
of the Spear of Destiny,
and I know that you know

788
00:40:17,476 --> 00:40:19,309
where the other pieces are hidden.

789
00:40:19,311 --> 00:40:22,012
I-I don't know anything.

790
00:40:22,014 --> 00:40:25,582
I-I-I-I swear.

791
00:40:25,584 --> 00:40:27,684
I am not Rip Hunter!

792
00:40:27,686 --> 00:40:29,986
I am...

793
00:40:29,988 --> 00:40:33,123
nobody. I...

794
00:40:35,574 --> 00:40:40,143
I can't believe this is happening to me.
