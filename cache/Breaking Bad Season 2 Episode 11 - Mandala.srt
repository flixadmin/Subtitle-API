00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:35,826
- What's up?
- How's it going?

3
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,245
All right.

4
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:08,693
What you need?

5
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,278
You buying
or you just stopping to envy?

6
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,035
Yeah. Punk bitches.

To send a numeric page...

9
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:12,413
Bounce, little man.

10
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:16,132
Skinny, I'm up on 2nd and Hazeltine,
getting eyeballed hard.

11
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:18,587
I got a bad feeling, man.
I need some backup.

12
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:21,094
Get your ass up here now.

13
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:27,895
- What's that thing in your ear?
- What did I say? Get out of here!

14
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:31,099
What are you waiting for? Go!

15
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:40,669
Well, Walt, we've made such headway
with your treatments...

16
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:44,091
...that now it's time we talked about
sealing the deal.

17
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:45,553
Absolutely.

18
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,143
As you know...

19
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:50,353
...my initial diagnosis was
that your cancer was inoperable.

20
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:54,315
That may no longer be the case.

21
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:59,022
We think now that a lobectomy
may be a viable option.

22
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,031
Maybe a pretty good option.

23
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,911
Dr. Bravenec is one of
the few surgeons in the country...

24
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:06,693
...performing lobectomies
after full-dosage radiation.

25
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:09,239
He's got a good track record.

26
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,035
Pretty good.

27
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:13,791
It sounds...

28
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,203
...aggressive.

29
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,543
Yes. Very much so.

30
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,546
Understand that
if you don't have this surgery...

31
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:24,051
...you're just waiting
for the cancer to spread.

32
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,387
And it will.

33
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:30,262
Through the treatment you've had,
we've bought you some time.

34
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,563
Maybe a lot, probably a little...

35
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:36,232
...but that's all.

36
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,234
In my opinion...

37
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,734
...if you're willing to take some risk...

38
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:43,071
...then this offers the best chance.

39
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:53,668
How much would it cost?
I mean, I'm not on your insurance.

40
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:56,664
I'd say between 170-...

41
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,288
...and 200,000, all in.

42
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:03,091
For my part, I'd be willing
to write off what I can...

43
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,090
...but mine isn't even
the biggest expense.

44
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:11,766
This is obviously a big decision...

45
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:15,264
...and you folks are gonna wanna
take some time to discuss it.

46
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:17,692
No.

47
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:20,151
I'll do it.

48
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:30,111
Walt, don't you think we should
at least talk this through first?

49
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:34,410
I just think it's the way to go.

50
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:41,792
I have to say,
I think it's the right choice.

51
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:45,090
I recommend
that we let the pneumonitis heal...

52
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:47,095
...for another couple of weeks...

53
00:05:47,306 --> 00:05:49,594
...and then we'll have at it.

54
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:53,057
That's tricky.

55
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:59,307
- When's the due date?
- It's the 21st.

56
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:00,855
So two weeks and change?

57
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,276
I'll book the surgery
for four weeks from now.

58
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:06,608
That way Walter can be on his feet
for the birth of your daughter.

59
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:10,159
But I wouldn't wait any longer.

60
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:13,158
Yeah.

61
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:32,845
Fourteen messages...

62
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,933
God.

63
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:39,476
- Yeah.
- It's me.

64
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:43,107
Where the hell were you?
I called, like, 20 times.

65
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,695
Working.

66
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:46,233
What is it?

67
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:50,992
Combo's dead.

68
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,198
Shot.

69
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:56,030
Which one is he?

70
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:58,870
You did not just say that to me.

71
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:01,541
- Jesse, listen...
- That figures.

72
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:15,845
What's the word on the street?

73
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:18,685
No one's dropping no names.

74
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:22,064
Combo rang me before it went down,
said dudes were mad-dogging him...

75
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:26,060
...trying to run him up off the corner.
That's all I know.

76
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:31,574
Why'd we have to go pushing
into new turf, yo? I mean...

77
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,576
...what'd you expect?

78
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,117
I don't know.

79
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:37,991
You don't know?

80
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,036
Is that all you got?

81
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:45,083
I'll do right by Combo's people.

82
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:51,552
But make sure you bust up your cell
and toss it, all right? We'll figure it out.

83
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,429
I appreciate what
you're saying and all...

84
00:07:56,643 --> 00:08:01,056
...but with Combo gone
and Badger laying low out in Cali...

85
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:03,524
I'm on probation, man.

86
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:06,604
Fast track to Los Lunas.

87
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:10,195
We're on the verge...

88
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:14,619
...of making some serious coin,
Skinny.

89
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:17,284
What, you're gonna jump ship now?

90
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:23,122
This game we playing? We don't got
the street cred to survive it.

91
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:26,084
Back when everyone thought
you killed Spooge...

92
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:29,169
...maybe we were doing okay,
but that whole...

93
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:32,672
- ...thing to the head thing, the ATM?
- Yeah?

94
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:34,631
His junkie bitch copped to it.

95
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:37,804
Whole town knows it wasn't you.

96
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:44,309
Everyone knows?

97
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:50,150
- Why didn't you say something?
- I don't know, man.

98
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:51,822
Because we like you and all.

99
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:55,152
I'm telling you, just sit tight.

100
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:57,316
We'll get by.

101
00:08:57,538 --> 00:09:01,322
- All right? We'll make it.
- Sorry, Jesse.

102
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,668
I'm out.

103
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:17,548
We have had a bit of a setback.

104
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:21,760
That's an accurate description.
What else do you want me to call it?

105
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:24,766
- How about "your fault"?
- No, no, don't lay that on me.

106
00:09:24,982 --> 00:09:28,148
- You are in charge of distribution.
- You said expand the territory.

107
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,768
- Doesn't mean you become careless.
- Guys, guys! Hey!

108
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:33,858
Do I look like Maury Povich?
I'm not your marriage counselor.

109
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,695
Now, you're professionals.
Act like it.

110
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,950
Now, setback. Go.

111
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:43,247
One of our dealers was murdered.

112
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:48,379
It was some kind of turf dispute...

113
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:50,712
...and apparently we lost.

114
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,633
And then everyone quit on us.

115
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:56,710
I mean,
we have absolutely no distribution.

116
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,386
Is there any way any of this
can be traced back to you?

117
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,639
Now, the police, I'm talking about.

118
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:06,390
Well, there's your silver lining.

119
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:09,394
How about you?
How's the health situation?

120
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:12,895
It's better. Do you mind?

121
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,572
Better?

122
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:17,948
Yeah, it's...

123
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:24,206
...looking a little more positive.

124
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,159
I may have more time than I thought.

125
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:28,203
Outstanding.

126
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,709
Now, as to your dead guy:

127
00:10:30,923 --> 00:10:32,714
occupational hazard.

128
00:10:32,925 --> 00:10:34,170
Drug dealer getting shot?

129
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:38,429
I'm gonna go out on a limb here
and say it's been known to happen.

130
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:41,723
Now, what about product on hand?
How's your inventory?

131
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:46,095
Thirty-eight and change.

132
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:48,187
Thirty-eight ounces? Grams?

133
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:49,596
Pounds.

134
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:55,059
You did say make hay
while the sun is shining.

135
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,356
Guys!

136
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:59,448
Why the long faces here?

137
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,783
You're sitting on a gold mine.

138
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:04,071
A gold mine we can't sell.

139
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:06,578
We need a proper infrastructure.

140
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:09,117
We need foot soldiers
and we need dealers...

141
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:11,163
...on a street level
that are rock solid.

142
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:14,464
We need muscle
and we need enforcers.

143
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:16,632
Payback. That's what we need.

144
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:23,307
God.

145
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:28,434
I mean, this entire process
has just been so...

146
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:35,478
It's always been one step forward
and two steps back.

147
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,189
We need your help.

148
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:42,488
Look, let's start with
some tough love, all right?

149
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:44,363
Ready for this? Here goes.

150
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:48,494
You two suck at peddling meth.
Period.

151
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:51,164
So give up on trying
to do it all yourselves.

152
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:53,786
Hell, I'm amazed you got this far.

153
00:11:54,006 --> 00:11:58,418
Look, we are not going to deal with
another high-level distributor.

154
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:00,842
No, thank you.
We have been down that road.

155
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,676
What, some tattooed speed freak?

156
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:07,306
No. What you two need
is an honest-to-God businessman.

157
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,311
Somebody who treats your product...

158
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:12,890
...like the simple
high-margin commodity that it is.

159
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:16,311
Somebody who ships out of town,
deals only in bulk.

160
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:20,858
Someone who's been doing this
for 20 years and never been caught.

161
00:12:23,035 --> 00:12:24,695
You know someone like that?

162
00:12:24,912 --> 00:12:28,861
Let's just say I know a guy
who knows a guy.

163
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,956
Who knows another guy.

164
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:35,000
Let me make some calls,
see if I can get you a meeting.

165
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:39,041
Well, what's his name?

166
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:41,844
I have no idea.

167
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:46,505
He's very low profile.
He's careful like that.

168
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:49,843
You know,
from what I do hear about him...

169
00:12:50,062 --> 00:12:52,054
...he sounds a little like you.

170
00:12:57,027 --> 00:12:59,862
And McDonald tabletops it, lands it.

171
00:13:00,072 --> 00:13:02,645
He's coming to the end
and he's got the big fist pump.

172
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:05,903
Now Mueller's coming.
Oh, a double! Here he comes.

173
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:09,654
And he's coming to the end
and he takes second.

174
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:11,913
I need you to leave.

175
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:22,882
Look, there's...

176
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:26,972
...some stuff about me
you don't know and...

177
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,514
Like you're a drug dealer?

178
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,856
I kind of got that.

179
00:13:37,276 --> 00:13:41,190
You pay in cash
and you use an alias, so...

180
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:49,950
One of my guys...

181
00:13:50,706 --> 00:13:53,541
...a friend who worked for me...

182
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:55,913
...got murdered.

183
00:13:57,796 --> 00:14:00,038
It was my fault.
I put him on that corner.

184
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:05,965
I'm gonna smoke some crystal
and I just think you should go...

185
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:10,224
...being that you're in a program
and all and...

186
00:14:13,395 --> 00:14:15,269
You could come with me
to a meeting.

187
00:14:17,316 --> 00:14:18,893
No.

188
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:21,611
No meetings.

189
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:26,063
We could just get out of here.

190
00:14:28,452 --> 00:14:32,746
- It won't help.
- Yeah, it will.

191
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:35,412
And I don't need you
telling me that it won't.

192
00:14:35,626 --> 00:14:37,168
I just...

193
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:41,126
All right, I really just need you to go.

194
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:50,739
Sir? Enjoy your meal.

195
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:52,529
Thank you.

196
00:16:23,734 --> 00:16:25,477
You're late.

197
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:28,267
Yeah.

198
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:31,276
We're in the big time now.

199
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:34,198
So where's the kingpin?

200
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:37,616
Your guess is as good as mine.

201
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:43,783
So you get the dude's name?

202
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:45,630
Nope.

203
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,089
So let me get this straight.
He's allowed to know all our names...

204
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:52,385
...what we look like,
but not the other way around?

205
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:57,971
Why don't you get yourself
some food?

206
00:16:58,185 --> 00:17:00,427
So we won't both sit here
with our Happy Meals...

207
00:17:00,646 --> 00:17:02,306
...looking like a couple chumps?

208
00:17:02,523 --> 00:17:05,310
Gentlemen,
is everything to your satisfaction?

209
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:07,062
Fine, thanks.

210
00:17:09,321 --> 00:17:12,275
This is nothing but an ankle-grab.

211
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:14,574
I don't get you, man.

212
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:18,569
A week ago you talked like
you were all ready to hang it up.

213
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:23,123
We've nearly got 40 pounds
we still need to sell.

214
00:17:23,335 --> 00:17:25,078
Yeah, what about after?

215
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:28,664
After you gonna make up
some new magic number?

216
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:31,338
Like, "I got bills. I got bills.
I gotta make more."

217
00:17:31,552 --> 00:17:33,675
What do you want me to say, Jesse?

218
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:37,471
- Things have changed.
- Oh, I know.

219
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:40,100
We got a guy killed.

220
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:45,432
You know what?

221
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,145
This is bullshit.

222
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:51,192
- I'm out of here.
- Hey.

223
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:04,201
I think she's waking up from a nap.

224
00:18:04,418 --> 00:18:07,834
She is certainly gonna wanna get out
and stretch those legs soon.

225
00:18:12,384 --> 00:18:14,044
We have to keep an eye
on your fluids.

226
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:15,921
You're on the low side of normal.

227
00:18:16,138 --> 00:18:18,711
What? How low?

228
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:22,052
It's not a problem unless we see
a growth drop-off, so we're good.

229
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:25,768
We'll have you in for an ultrasound
next week and keep an eye on things.

230
00:18:27,316 --> 00:18:28,726
Hey.

231
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:31,065
Oh, man,
you would not believe the traffic.

232
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:33,235
That's why I left 40 minutes early.

233
00:18:33,447 --> 00:18:35,439
- Sorry. Hi.
- Hi.

234
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:38,065
- What did I miss?
- For your refrigerator.

235
00:18:38,994 --> 00:18:40,369
Oh, my God.

236
00:18:40,579 --> 00:18:41,777
Look at her.

237
00:18:41,997 --> 00:18:43,408
- Look.
- Yeah.

238
00:18:43,624 --> 00:18:46,245
God. It's like she's here already.

239
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:50,043
I was just telling Skyler
everything looks great.

240
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:52,462
Okay, we've been talking
about it for months now.

241
00:18:52,674 --> 00:18:54,584
It's time to make a decision.

242
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:57,921
- You know what I'm gonna say.
- The C-section?

243
00:18:58,138 --> 00:19:00,380
And if it's a yes,
we need to schedule it.

244
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:06,518
Well, my last labor
was pretty tough, so...

245
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,650
For the baby, I say yes.

246
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:12,610
I agree, considering that your fluids
are on the low side.

247
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:17,113
It's best we take her a little early.
So why don't we schedule it for...

248
00:19:17,324 --> 00:19:18,783
...a week from Friday?

249
00:19:21,662 --> 00:19:23,453
Isn't that a Friday the 13th?

250
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:29,995
We have a birthday.

251
00:19:30,504 --> 00:19:32,046
The 16th.

252
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:34,379
- I like it.
- Yeah.

253
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:37,876
You know, speaking of birthdays...

254
00:19:38,095 --> 00:19:41,630
...I've got to run back to the office,
so I will see you later?

255
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:44,636
It's an hour before closing.

256
00:19:44,852 --> 00:19:46,891
You're supposed to be
taking it easy.

257
00:19:47,104 --> 00:19:49,310
We're having a get-together
for Ted's birthday...

258
00:19:49,523 --> 00:19:51,147
...and I've gotta pick up the cake.

259
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:52,895
Why you?

260
00:19:53,861 --> 00:19:57,609
Because I said I would...?

261
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:00,396
It is the least I can do.

262
00:20:01,243 --> 00:20:03,532
- Okay?
- Yeah, okay. Yeah.

263
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:05,121
- Bye.
- Bye.

264
00:20:53,921 --> 00:20:55,712
Let's get out of here.

265
00:20:55,923 --> 00:20:58,129
You know, go do something.

266
00:20:59,635 --> 00:21:01,426
Seriously.

267
00:21:01,762 --> 00:21:05,047
You know that museum in Santa Fe
you talked about?

268
00:21:05,641 --> 00:21:07,598
Let's take a drive.

269
00:21:11,647 --> 00:21:13,224
Sure.

270
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,704
No, I cannot return that stock.
It's been drilled, it's been cut.

271
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,829
We're halfway through the job.

272
00:21:37,422 --> 00:21:41,919
Mr. Beneke to the shop, please.
Mr. Beneke to the shop.

273
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:45,715
All right.
Just let me think about it, okay?

274
00:21:45,931 --> 00:21:47,176
I gotta go.

275
00:21:47,391 --> 00:21:49,383
Dean, I gotta go.

276
00:21:49,601 --> 00:21:51,760
Okay, all right.

277
00:21:54,773 --> 00:21:57,608
Happy birthday!

278
00:21:58,485 --> 00:21:59,766
Happy birthday!

279
00:21:59,987 --> 00:22:03,190
Oh, my God. This is beautiful, guys.
Thank you very much.

280
00:22:03,407 --> 00:22:06,112
Hurry. These candles aren't gonna
hold out much longer.

281
00:22:06,952 --> 00:22:09,953
Wait a minute. You making a wish?
You gotta make a wish.

282
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:14,031
Okay. Well, let's see.
The economy's in the toilet.

283
00:22:14,251 --> 00:22:17,454
China's undercutting us at every turn.
I'm at a loss.

284
00:22:19,756 --> 00:22:22,294
- Wait. Skyler?
- Yes?

285
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:24,087
I wanna hear it first.

286
00:22:25,012 --> 00:22:26,554
Absolutely not. No way.

287
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:29,005
You cannot deny your employer
his birthday wish.

288
00:22:29,224 --> 00:22:31,976
- Yes, I can. Watch me.
- Please!

289
00:22:32,186 --> 00:22:35,970
If this is your birthday wish,
I feel very, very sorry for you.

290
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:39,641
- Come on. It was so good last time.
- It was ages ago.

291
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:42,730
And I'm enormous now.

292
00:22:42,946 --> 00:22:45,153
And I don't look anything
like her anymore.

293
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:47,654
Not that I ever did. I mean, come on.

294
00:22:47,868 --> 00:22:50,275
These candles are getting wax
all over the place.

295
00:22:50,495 --> 00:22:52,239
- Seriously.
- Yes, come on, Skyler.

296
00:22:52,456 --> 00:22:57,165
- Skyler, Skyler, Skyler...
- It's obscene.

297
00:22:57,377 --> 00:23:00,331
Skyler, Skyler, Skyler...

298
00:23:10,641 --> 00:23:16,015
Happy birthday to you

299
00:23:17,397 --> 00:23:22,854
Happy birthday to you

300
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:30,609
Happy birthday, Mr. President

301
00:23:30,827 --> 00:23:35,121
Of Beneke Fabricators Incorporated

302
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,704
Happy birthday

303
00:23:41,255 --> 00:23:44,374
To you

304
00:23:48,387 --> 00:23:50,047
That was fantastic.

305
00:23:50,264 --> 00:23:52,090
Isn't she great, huh?

306
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:54,676
Okay, here we go.

307
00:24:06,697 --> 00:24:09,401
- He wasn't there.
- Oh, he was there, all right.

308
00:24:09,616 --> 00:24:12,154
What are you talking about?
I sat there for two hours.

309
00:24:12,369 --> 00:24:13,484
Nobody came.

310
00:24:13,704 --> 00:24:16,325
All I know is my contact
said he was there.

311
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:18,782
Are you sure you were
at the right restaurant?

312
00:24:19,001 --> 00:24:20,827
Yes, I'm positive.

313
00:24:21,044 --> 00:24:22,539
- Where was he?
- Who knows?

314
00:24:22,754 --> 00:24:25,424
Maybe he checked you out
with a telephoto lens...

315
00:24:25,632 --> 00:24:27,424
...didn't like the cut of your jib.

316
00:24:27,634 --> 00:24:32,012
Anyway, it doesn't matter now
because my contact says it's a no-go.

317
00:24:33,015 --> 00:24:34,675
What? What do you mean?

318
00:24:34,892 --> 00:24:36,267
No deal. No dice.

319
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:38,434
Shot at and missed. Shit on and hit.

320
00:24:38,896 --> 00:24:39,891
Wait a minute.

321
00:24:40,105 --> 00:24:42,596
How can he make that decision
without even meeting me?

322
00:24:42,816 --> 00:24:45,936
I told you, he's very cautious
who he does business with, all right?

323
00:24:46,778 --> 00:24:50,610
He's skittish, like a deer.

324
00:24:52,492 --> 00:24:53,868
Call him back.

325
00:24:54,077 --> 00:24:56,117
I'm sorry. I can't do that.

326
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:58,951
Yes, you can. Call him, Saul.

327
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:01,408
First of all,
I never called him, all right?

328
00:25:01,627 --> 00:25:03,868
I called a guy who called a guy
who called a guy.

329
00:25:04,087 --> 00:25:05,747
Second of all, it's over.

330
00:25:05,964 --> 00:25:08,420
Understand?
With this particular individual...

331
00:25:08,634 --> 00:25:11,006
...all you get is the one shot.

332
00:25:12,262 --> 00:25:13,460
Look...

333
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,302
...I'll see if I can scrape
something else together...

334
00:25:16,517 --> 00:25:18,260
...but don't get your hopes up.

335
00:25:18,477 --> 00:25:21,229
No one else handles
that kind of bulk.

336
00:25:21,438 --> 00:25:22,980
Damn it.

337
00:27:03,457 --> 00:27:06,493
Lucy, you must remember to have
the salt and pepper shakers wiped.

338
00:27:13,842 --> 00:27:15,586
Can I help you, sir?

339
00:27:17,471 --> 00:27:19,713
Diet Coke, please.

340
00:27:21,808 --> 00:27:24,679
And five minutes of your time.

341
00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:37,943
- What can I do for you?
- Have a seat.

342
00:27:39,826 --> 00:27:41,285
Please.

343
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:57,009
I would like to know why you wouldn't
meet with me yesterday.

344
00:27:58,387 --> 00:28:01,092
I'm sorry. I'm not following.

345
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:05,841
I sat here yesterday,
waiting to meet with someone.

346
00:28:06,603 --> 00:28:09,059
I believe that person was you.

347
00:28:09,523 --> 00:28:12,808
I think that you're confusing me
for someone else.

348
00:28:14,152 --> 00:28:15,563
I don't think I am.

349
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,527
Sir, if you have a complaint...

350
00:28:21,743 --> 00:28:23,985
...I suggest you submit it
through our e-mail system.

351
00:28:24,204 --> 00:28:26,660
I would be happy to refer you
to our website.

352
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:31,126
I was told that the man
I would be meeting with...

353
00:28:31,336 --> 00:28:33,625
...is very careful.

354
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:35,831
A cautious man.

355
00:28:37,009 --> 00:28:39,547
I believe we're alike in that way.

356
00:28:41,638 --> 00:28:45,303
If you are who I think you are...

357
00:28:45,851 --> 00:28:47,927
...you should give me another chance.

358
00:28:53,025 --> 00:28:55,860
I don't think we're alike at all,
Mr. White.

359
00:28:57,696 --> 00:29:00,483
You are not a cautious man at all.

360
00:29:00,699 --> 00:29:03,700
Your partner was late
and he was high.

361
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:07,622
Yes. Yes, he was.

362
00:29:08,415 --> 00:29:11,618
He's high often, isn't he?

363
00:29:15,214 --> 00:29:17,005
You have poor judgment.

364
00:29:18,425 --> 00:29:20,465
I can't work with someone
with poor judgment.

365
00:29:20,677 --> 00:29:23,797
Are you familiar with my product?

366
00:29:24,431 --> 00:29:28,014
- I've been told it's excellent.
- It is impeccable.

367
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:30,680
It is the purest...

368
00:29:30,896 --> 00:29:34,347
...most chemically sound product
on the market anywhere.

369
00:29:34,566 --> 00:29:36,891
That is not the only factor.

370
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:41,060
You could charge twice the current rate
for what I provide...

371
00:29:41,281 --> 00:29:43,737
...and your customers would pay it.

372
00:29:44,284 --> 00:29:46,028
Hands down.

373
00:29:46,787 --> 00:29:53,205
Now, who I choose to do business with
on my end is not your problem.

374
00:29:54,127 --> 00:29:55,408
You won't see him.

375
00:29:55,629 --> 00:29:58,381
You won't interact with him.

376
00:29:58,966 --> 00:30:00,590
Forget he exists.

377
00:30:02,052 --> 00:30:04,424
I have to ask.

378
00:30:06,181 --> 00:30:07,260
Why?

379
00:30:07,474 --> 00:30:09,266
Why him?

380
00:30:11,645 --> 00:30:14,480
Because he does what I say.

381
00:30:15,941 --> 00:30:18,349
Because I can trust him.

382
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:22,110
How much product
do you have on hand?

383
00:30:22,906 --> 00:30:24,780
Thirty-eight pounds.

384
00:30:24,992 --> 00:30:27,613
Ready to go at a moment's notice.

385
00:30:33,876 --> 00:30:35,702
Will I hear from you?

386
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,755
I have your numbers.

387
00:30:43,969 --> 00:30:47,919
You can never trust a drug addict.

388
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:05,651
Look, I mean, it's all kind of
little dribs and drabs...

389
00:31:05,866 --> 00:31:09,033
...but right here,
take Keller, for instance.

390
00:31:09,244 --> 00:31:12,779
A couple hundred dollars here,
a few thousand there.

391
00:31:12,998 --> 00:31:14,540
Dribs and drabs.

392
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:16,826
Once you add it all up, though,
with Keller...

393
00:31:17,044 --> 00:31:20,495
...the revenues are almost 10 percent
less than was actually received.

394
00:31:20,714 --> 00:31:25,791
And this is every quarter
for the last two years.

395
00:31:28,722 --> 00:31:32,471
When I saw that, I got worried
so I checked Accounts Receivable.

396
00:31:32,684 --> 00:31:35,685
I found six other instances...

397
00:31:36,855 --> 00:31:39,393
...of revenues being under-reported.

398
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,105
And I've only just started
to look into it.

399
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:46,689
We have requirement contracts
with a lot of these companies.

400
00:31:46,907 --> 00:31:49,149
They anticipate their needs
for the next quarter.

401
00:31:49,368 --> 00:31:51,241
Most of the time, they overestimate.

402
00:31:51,453 --> 00:31:53,861
I let them roll their overages
into the next order...

403
00:31:54,081 --> 00:31:56,204
...and if I don't, they'll go elsewhere.

404
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:58,041
Obviously, we forgot...

405
00:31:58,252 --> 00:32:02,249
...or didn't go back
and adjust the revenue entries.

406
00:32:02,464 --> 00:32:05,714
I know it's wrong from an accounting
standpoint, but as you can see...

407
00:32:05,926 --> 00:32:09,544
...the money's coming in eventually,
as you can see.

408
00:32:10,639 --> 00:32:12,014
Right.

409
00:32:12,349 --> 00:32:13,808
Right...

410
00:32:14,017 --> 00:32:18,644
...but I got the old bills of sale
and order forms out of storage...

411
00:32:18,856 --> 00:32:21,228
...to try and sort this out.

412
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:26,404
Most of the time, there's no backup
for the reported revenues at all.

413
00:32:27,823 --> 00:32:29,899
In a few cases...

414
00:32:31,326 --> 00:32:34,576
...I found xeroxed copies
with the dates changed.

415
00:32:37,624 --> 00:32:39,332
Ted.

416
00:32:49,511 --> 00:32:51,136
All right.

417
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:54,514
You got me.

418
00:32:55,058 --> 00:32:59,934
We're talking nearly a million dollars
of undocumented revenue.

419
00:33:00,397 --> 00:33:03,517
- What are you thinking?
- I'm thinking...

420
00:33:03,734 --> 00:33:05,892
...about saving a company.

421
00:33:06,111 --> 00:33:07,902
I'm thinking about people's jobs...

422
00:33:08,113 --> 00:33:09,904
...about their mortgages
and pensions...

423
00:33:10,115 --> 00:33:13,401
...and their college funds
for their kids.

424
00:33:14,244 --> 00:33:15,442
Not to mention my own.

425
00:33:15,662 --> 00:33:18,236
It doesn't mean that you have to
break the law.

426
00:33:18,457 --> 00:33:20,117
Yes, it does, Skyler.

427
00:33:20,334 --> 00:33:22,243
It's in the books.
Business is terrible.

428
00:33:22,461 --> 00:33:25,746
The bank is on my back,
the IRS is grinding me down to a nub.

429
00:33:25,964 --> 00:33:27,423
- If I don't keep up...
- Ted.

430
00:33:27,633 --> 00:33:30,468
People go to prison for this.

431
00:33:36,475 --> 00:33:39,559
My dad built this company
from nothing.

432
00:33:40,437 --> 00:33:42,893
We make things here.

433
00:33:43,106 --> 00:33:46,143
The people who work here
are like family.

434
00:33:46,693 --> 00:33:50,442
I can't let that all fall apart
because of a couple of bad years.

435
00:33:55,077 --> 00:33:56,108
Sky...

436
00:33:58,914 --> 00:34:00,907
...don't report this.

437
00:34:01,917 --> 00:34:03,495
Please.

438
00:34:05,754 --> 00:34:08,375
I'm not gonna turn you in, Ted.

439
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:15,675
But I can't be a part of it.

440
00:34:18,725 --> 00:34:20,220
I know.

441
00:34:20,853 --> 00:34:23,094
I know. I just wish...

442
00:34:24,231 --> 00:34:25,939
I'm sorry.

443
00:34:28,068 --> 00:34:29,895
I don't want you to go.

444
00:34:47,629 --> 00:34:50,714
Yo, if I know you, leave a message.

445
00:34:50,924 --> 00:34:53,676
Yo, it's Skinny Pete.
Just checking in with you, man.

446
00:34:53,886 --> 00:34:55,712
We missed you at the funeral today.

447
00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:57,388
The whole crew was representing.

448
00:34:57,598 --> 00:34:59,555
Even Badger came
all the way from Fresno.

449
00:34:59,766 --> 00:35:01,842
Combo's people, his ma,
grandma, cousins...

450
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:04,018
...everyone was all choked up
and shit.

451
00:35:04,229 --> 00:35:06,899
Man, it was, like, emotional.

452
00:35:07,107 --> 00:35:09,064
And you should have
seen the coffin.

453
00:35:09,276 --> 00:35:11,150
It was this shiny white pearlescent.

454
00:35:11,361 --> 00:35:14,446
I'm sure I've seen
the exact same paint job on a Lexus.

455
00:35:14,656 --> 00:35:17,610
So we're definitely talking high-end.

456
00:35:17,826 --> 00:35:21,029
Anyway, guess you had something
bigger going down.

457
00:35:21,246 --> 00:35:24,331
Watch your back out there, bro.
Peace.

458
00:36:06,834 --> 00:36:08,791
I like to mix some ice with it.

459
00:36:57,342 --> 00:36:59,002
Hold that.

460
00:37:01,388 --> 00:37:02,847
What's it feel like?

461
00:37:06,518 --> 00:37:08,310
There's a chill.

462
00:37:09,521 --> 00:37:11,763
Don't freak out. It passes.

463
00:37:12,232 --> 00:37:13,513
And then...

464
00:37:13,734 --> 00:37:14,848
You'll see.

465
00:37:19,615 --> 00:37:21,275
I'll meet you there.

466
00:37:33,045 --> 00:37:34,669
Take that off.

467
00:40:04,196 --> 00:40:06,651
Phones off, please.

468
00:40:24,758 --> 00:40:26,798
Pipes, I guess.

469
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:29,798
All right, everyone.
Eyes on your paper.

470
00:40:30,389 --> 00:40:32,465
Eyes on your paper.

471
00:40:47,573 --> 00:40:48,901
Yes.

472
00:41:03,297 --> 00:41:04,791
Excuse me, where's the manager?

473
00:41:05,007 --> 00:41:07,295
I'm the manager. Can I help you?

474
00:41:07,509 --> 00:41:10,925
No, no, no.
I met a man here last week.

475
00:41:11,138 --> 00:41:14,008
He's a black gentleman.
He's thin. Glasses.

476
00:41:14,224 --> 00:41:15,766
Yes, sir. That's the owner.

477
00:41:15,976 --> 00:41:17,803
Oh, owner. Okay.

478
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:20,771
He owns 14 Los Pollos restaurants
in between here and Nevada.

479
00:41:20,981 --> 00:41:23,270
He could be at any one of them.

480
00:41:24,443 --> 00:41:28,026
Is there a phone number
that I can get to...?

481
00:41:28,238 --> 00:41:30,943
I'm sorry, sir. I can't give that out.

482
00:41:31,158 --> 00:41:34,242
Is this about a complaint? I'd be happy
to refer you to our website.

483
00:41:34,453 --> 00:41:36,280
No, no.

484
00:41:36,496 --> 00:41:38,454
- What's his name?
- Gustavo.

485
00:41:38,665 --> 00:41:40,160
Gus.

486
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:41,371
Thank you.

487
00:41:45,672 --> 00:41:48,080
Thirty-eight pounds, $1.2 million.

488
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:51,751
Truck stop,
two miles south of Exit 13 on the 25.

489
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:53,299
- One hour.
- What?

490
00:41:53,514 --> 00:41:54,889
One hour. You in or out?

491
00:41:55,516 --> 00:41:58,682
In. In. Absolutely.
But I just need a little more time.

492
00:41:58,894 --> 00:42:00,887
One hour. If you miss it...

493
00:42:01,104 --> 00:42:03,809
...don't ever show your face
in here again.

494
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:12,650
Exit 13 off the 25 South,
to a truck...

495
00:42:12,866 --> 00:42:15,986
- Come on! Come on!
- Yo, if I know you, leave a message.

496
00:42:16,203 --> 00:42:18,990
Jesse. Jesse, pick up the phone.

497
00:42:19,206 --> 00:42:21,033
Pick up the phone.

498
00:42:21,708 --> 00:42:24,579
I'm coming by. I need the product.

499
00:42:24,795 --> 00:42:26,586
I need the product now.

500
00:43:14,011 --> 00:43:16,466
Oh, God.

501
00:43:28,025 --> 00:43:29,400
Jesse.

502
00:43:32,821 --> 00:43:34,446
Jesse!

503
00:43:35,073 --> 00:43:36,698
Jesse.

504
00:43:37,534 --> 00:43:39,242
Jesse.

505
00:43:59,139 --> 00:44:01,844
Jesse. Jesse.

506
00:44:03,018 --> 00:44:04,809
Jesse.

507
00:44:26,625 --> 00:44:28,783
Jesse.

508
00:44:29,002 --> 00:44:30,580
Jesse. Jesse, wake up.

509
00:44:30,796 --> 00:44:32,456
Jesse.

510
00:44:33,215 --> 00:44:35,788
Jesse. Jesse, wake up. Wake up.

511
00:44:36,009 --> 00:44:37,124
Wake up!

512
00:44:37,344 --> 00:44:38,922
Come on, damn it.

513
00:44:39,137 --> 00:44:40,418
Wake up.

514
00:44:41,807 --> 00:44:42,803
Where'd you put it?

515
00:44:43,016 --> 00:44:44,760
- Where's the product?
- Get off of me.

516
00:44:44,977 --> 00:44:47,847
Where is it?
Where'd you hide the meth?

517
00:44:48,063 --> 00:44:49,806
- In the kitchen.
- Where?

518
00:44:50,649 --> 00:44:52,642
Under the sink.

519
00:45:55,088 --> 00:46:00,047
No. No, no, no.
Not now, not now. Not now!

520
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:08,241
