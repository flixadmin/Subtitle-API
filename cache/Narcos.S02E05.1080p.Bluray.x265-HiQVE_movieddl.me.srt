20
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:39,544
Agent Peña?

21
00:00:41,379 --> 00:00:45,508
It looks like you raided
the family album...

22
00:00:45,633 --> 00:00:47,426
Mrs Moncada.

23
00:00:47,552 --> 00:00:49,220
Please, call me Judy.

24
00:00:51,013 --> 00:00:53,099
Let me tell you...

25
00:00:53,224 --> 00:00:56,394
before this son of a bitch
killed my husband and my brother,

26
00:00:56,519 --> 00:00:58,813
all these people were my friends.
What do you think of that?

27
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:03,859
Well, it looks to me
like you made some new friends. No?

28
00:01:03,985 --> 00:01:08,823
We might say
that we share a common goal.

29
00:01:10,658 --> 00:01:13,411
- The same as yours, Agent Peña.
- Is that right?

30
00:01:13,536 --> 00:01:15,997
- Yes.
- (Chuckles)

fucking kidding me.

00:01:21,919 --> 00:01:24,547
(In Spanish) Wait, Javier.

33
00:01:24,672 --> 00:01:27,675
I'd like you to listen
to what we have to say.

34
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:32,722
You want to catch Escobar,
just like we do.

35
00:01:32,847 --> 00:01:35,641
But let's not lie to ourselves.

36
00:01:35,766 --> 00:01:39,145
You haven't been able
to get close to him.

37
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:43,858
The only play you had to get to him
was using Carrillo.

38
00:01:43,983 --> 00:01:46,819
And we know how that ended, right?

39
00:01:46,944 --> 00:01:51,782
So, you're taking a break
from burning down villages?

40
00:01:51,907 --> 00:01:56,746
What we do is fill in
for an absent government.

41
00:01:56,871 --> 00:02:01,792
We're going to kill everyone
close to Escobar one by one.

42
00:02:01,917 --> 00:02:06,047
Until he's alone. With nothing.

43
00:02:06,631 --> 00:02:09,175
(Fidel) What we want, Mr Peña,

44
00:02:09,592 --> 00:02:13,012
is to make Escobar understand
he is not untouchable.

45
00:02:13,137 --> 00:02:14,972
We want him to be afraid.

46
00:02:15,681 --> 00:02:17,391
There's just one small problem.

47
00:02:18,434 --> 00:02:20,770
Just one?

48
00:02:20,895 --> 00:02:26,901
To catch him, we need the satellite
technology and surveillance

49
00:02:27,026 --> 00:02:29,111
that your government has,
Agent Peña.

50
00:02:30,321 --> 00:02:33,699
And I'm just going <i>to...</i>
hand that over to you?

51
00:02:33,824 --> 00:02:37,161
We have been partners for a while now,
Agent Peña.

52
00:02:38,204 --> 00:02:41,290
All the information that he gave to you,
I gave to him.

53
00:02:43,042 --> 00:02:47,213
We are simply making...
a small adjustment.

54
00:03:00,267 --> 00:03:02,353
Thanks for the drink.

55
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,709

56
00:03:26,669 --> 00:03:30,506
The Castaños can be useful.

57
00:03:30,631 --> 00:03:32,633
I was talking about you.

58
00:03:34,969 --> 00:03:36,470
Yes, Javier.

59
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,890
I'm a narco.

60
00:03:40,015 --> 00:03:42,727
And I believe in honour and loyalty,
like you.

61

(Judy sighs)

65
00:04:00,953 --> 00:04:03,956
Are you going to give me a cigarette
or what?

66
00:04:16,552 --> 00:04:18,053
Mmm.

67
00:04:20,181 --> 00:04:21,682
Well...

68
00:04:24,185 --> 00:04:27,271
we really want you to realise,
Agent Peña,

69
00:04:27,396 --> 00:04:31,901
the potential of what we're offering you.
Mmm?

70
00:04:33,277 --> 00:04:37,948
Because, well...
with all the information in the world,

71
00:04:38,073 --> 00:04:40,785
you still have to be a policeman, right?

72
00:04:44,371 --> 00:04:48,709
I know what it feels like
when Pablo kills someone close to you.

73
00:04:51,796 --> 00:04:52,797
What's that?

74
00:04:53,464 --> 00:04:56,550
Information that would be
very valuable to you.

75
00:04:56,675 --> 00:04:59,011
That was very easy for us to find.
Take it.

76
00:05:03,474 --> 00:05:08,729
She's staying with a friend.
That little girl, Maritza.

77
00:05:08,854 --> 00:05:12,024
The woman that betrayed you
and got Carrillo killed.

78
00:05:12,149 --> 00:05:13,984
You'll find her there.

79
00:05:18,322 --> 00:05:20,991
I told you we have an enemy
in common.

00:11:23,061 --> 00:11:25,147
- No! No!
- Stay still!

164
00:11:25,397 --> 00:11:26,899
Please.

165
00:11:29,526 --> 00:11:31,153
Do you think I wanted this?

166
00:11:32,404 --> 00:11:34,740
They used me
and they're throwing my life away.

167
00:11:35,532 --> 00:11:38,619
(In English) You're breaking
my fucking heart, baby.

168
00:11:41,288 --> 00:11:43,415
(In Spanish) You're all the same.

169
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:46,960
You don'<i>t</i> listen.
Nobody listens!

170
00:11:47,085 --> 00:11:50,672
And all those people dying
for no reason.

171
00:11:54,343 --> 00:11:57,054
What's up, Peña?
What should we do with her?

172
00:12:02,768 --> 00:12:06,104
- (Connie speaks indistinctly)
- (In English) She's good with kids.

173
00:12:11,318 --> 00:12:13,362
I'm so sorry for your loss, Mrs Carrillo.

174
00:12:21,453 --> 00:12:25,040
I keep wondering
if it's better to know the truth.

175
00:12:26,792 --> 00:12:28,835
I don'<i>t</i> follow.

176
00:12:29,878 --> 00:12:34,258
The things they said about my husband,
about what he did before he was killed.

177
00:12:35,425 --> 00:12:37,678
Did he shoot a child?

178
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,975
Did he kill that boy
like they said on the news?

179
00:12:44,935 --> 00:12:47,771
No. Absolutely not.

180
00:12:49,731 --> 00:12:54,736
Your husband did everything
in his means to get Escobar.

181
00:12:55,821 --> 00:12:58,156
But he did not cross the line.

182
00:13:06,373 --> 00:13:08,792
Well, that was rough.

183
00:13:12,963 --> 00:13:15,215
- I just kept looking at her, thinking...
- Hey.

184
00:13:16,883 --> 00:13:20,304
It's not gonna happen to me,
it's not gonna happen to us.

185
00:13:22,472 --> 00:13:24,808
You want me to come home?

186
00:13:29,855 --> 00:13:34,234
Just make sure you're still you
when it's all over.

187
00:13:40,115 --> 00:13:43,327
So three years in the jungles
fighting FARC.

188
00:13:44,286 --> 00:13:48,749
Hugo Martinez chose his own path
a long time ago

189
00:13:48,874 --> 00:13:50,834
and he hasn'<i>t</i> deviated
from it since.

190
00:13:51,585 --> 00:13:56,381
He's methodical, favours procedure
and strict protocol.

191
00:13:56,506 --> 00:13:59,009
Do you think you can get him
to do it?

192
00:14:01,219 --> 00:14:04,139
(Steve) 'How do you get a man
to take a job that nobody wants?

193
00:14:04,264 --> 00:14:05,349
'Don'<i>t</i> get me wrong.

194

'There was no shortage of brave men

'But signing up to replace Carrillo
as the head of the Search Bloc

196
00:14:12,856 --> 00:14:15,150
'would take a lot more than bravery.

to find the right volunteer.'

199

200
00:14:24,785 --> 00:14:27,412
Over there with the president?

201
00:14:31,917 --> 00:14:33,752
That's cool.

(Applause)

203
00:14:42,677 --> 00:14:47,391
To all those present,
it is my honour to present

204
00:14:47,516 --> 00:14:50,936
the President of the Republic...

205
00:14:51,978 --> 00:14:57,567
His Excellency,
Don César Augusto Gaviria Trujillo.

206

(Applause)

207
00:15:05,409 --> 00:15:08,370
(Gaviria) Congratulations, Class of 1992.

208
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:11,832
Recent events...

209
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:16,586
contrast heavily
with today's ceremony.

210
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:23,343
Each one of you has decided to sacrifice
your personal interests...

211
00:15:24,136 --> 00:15:28,974
and dedicate your lives
to the service of the nation.

212
00:15:32,394 --> 00:15:34,396
There is no higher honour...

213
00:15:36,314 --> 00:15:38,316
than to serve your homeland.

214
00:15:38,442 --> 00:15:41,528
(♪ Band plays up-tempo patriotic music)

215
00:15:46,616 --> 00:15:49,077
- Colonel, how are you doing?
- Very well.

216
00:15:49,202 --> 00:15:51,496
I enjoyed your speech very much,
Mr President.

217
00:15:51,621 --> 00:15:53,832
I'm glad. It was also for you.

218
00:15:55,625 --> 00:16:01,214
Look, Colonel, in the last 24 hours,
I've been discussing with my advisors

219
00:16:01,339 --> 00:16:04,718
who should be at the head
of the Search Bloc.

220
00:16:04,843 --> 00:16:07,637
They mentioned many names.

221
00:16:07,762 --> 00:16:11,975
But I would like it to be you,
Colonel Martinez.

222
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,687
That's an honour, Mr President,
but at this point in my career,

223
00:16:15,812 --> 00:16:17,647
I'm sure you can find
a better candidate.

224
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,901
Colombia wants to end this nightmare.

225
00:16:21,985 --> 00:16:25,238
And I know you're the man
to do it.

226
00:16:25,697 --> 00:16:28,366
The nation deserves someone
better than me.

227
00:16:30,035 --> 00:16:33,830
Your son was one of the best
in the academy.

228
00:16:33,955 --> 00:16:35,373
He's an excellent cadet.

229
00:16:35,499 --> 00:16:37,918
He worked very hard.
I'm very proud of him.

230
00:16:39,044 --> 00:16:43,882
We asked the best in the class
to join the Search Bloc.

231
00:16:45,091 --> 00:16:46,843
And your son happily accepted.

232
00:16:49,596 --> 00:16:52,057
I ask that you at least
consider my request.

233
00:16:54,184 --> 00:16:55,685
For Colombia.

234
00:16:59,064 --> 00:17:02,567

- Carlos!
- Tata!

237
00:17:20,085 --> 00:17:23,088
Come on, come on.
Let's see.

238
00:17:23,213 --> 00:17:24,506
Go ahead.

239
00:17:24,631 --> 00:17:28,218
- I can'<i>t</i> believe <i>it.</i> Look at you.
- Slowly, slowly.

240
00:17:28,343 --> 00:17:30,762
I don'<i>t want</i> any more visits
to the doctor.

241
00:17:30,887 --> 00:17:33,223
Manuela, you're so beautiful.
Look at me.

242
00:17:33,348 --> 00:17:34,891
Look how tanned he is.

243
00:17:35,016 --> 00:17:37,811
- (Chuckles)
- He looks like a movie star, right?

244
00:17:37,936 --> 00:17:39,104
Yes, boss.

245
00:17:39,229 --> 00:17:40,855
- He looks like Tom Cruise.
- Well...

246
00:17:40,981 --> 00:17:42,399
(Carlos) Look at her, Pablo.

247
00:17:42,524 --> 00:17:45,235
I can'<i>t</i> believe you brought me
from Miami to see my sister like this.

248
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,364
No. I'm just so happy to see you.

249
00:17:49,489 --> 00:17:52,784
Oh, my God. Carlos!

250
00:17:54,452 --> 00:17:58,540
Welcome, sweetie.
I'm so happy to have you home.

251
00:17:58,665 --> 00:18:01,543
Tonight, I am going to make
the best meal this family has ever had.

252
00:18:02,335 --> 00:18:05,714
Well, then...
ready to go for a little walk?

253
00:18:06,756 --> 00:18:09,843
(Carlos) It's incredible how much
the children have grown, Pablo.

254
00:18:09,968 --> 00:18:12,804
Manuelita is a princess.
She is beautiful.

255
00:18:12,929 --> 00:18:16,933
She's the one who controls everything
around here. I just pay the bills.

256
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,811
I heard about Carrillo.

257
00:18:20,979 --> 00:18:24,024
If that son of a bitch was still alive,
many more policemen would have died.

258
00:18:24,149 --> 00:18:28,278
I did the police a favour.
Believe me.

259
00:18:28,612 --> 00:18:31,114
Do you think the police
agree with you?

260
00:18:31,239 --> 00:18:32,824
No one wants war, Carlos.

261
00:18:33,158 --> 00:18:36,661
Especially when they know
they would lose.

262
00:18:36,786 --> 00:18:38,997
But all that's in the past.

263
00:18:39,122 --> 00:18:44,753
And I'm ready to get back to business.
I'm all in.

264
00:18:44,878 --> 00:18:48,298
- Tell me about Miami.
- What can I tell you, Pablo?

265
00:18:48,423 --> 00:18:52,260
The demand keeps increasing
and the merchandise keeps on coming.

266
00:18:52,385 --> 00:18:54,929
Business hasn'<i>t</i> been affected
by what happened at La Catedral,

267
00:18:55,055 --> 00:18:57,307
nor by what you did.

268
00:18:58,391 --> 00:19:02,479
Well, business can always
get better, right?

269
00:19:02,604 --> 00:19:05,023
(Steve) 'Business was pretty good.

270
00:19:05,148 --> 00:19:08,902

- Make some new arrangements.

to making money, brother.

- Exactly.

What's up, Maritza?

308
00:21:23,203 --> 00:21:24,370
What happened?

The police are looking for me.
They want to put a bullet in my head.

I'm sorry, Maritza. I thought something
good would come from all this.

00:21:49,187 --> 00:21:50,647
I have to get this.

317
00:21:50,772 --> 00:21:52,857
Give me one second.

318
00:21:55,527 --> 00:21:56,528
What's up?

319
00:21:56,653 --> 00:21:59,030
Where the fuck are you, Limón?

320
00:21:59,155 --> 00:22:01,032
Think you can make me
wait around for you, bitch?

321
00:22:01,658 --> 00:22:03,493
I'm close by, man.

322
00:22:03,618 --> 00:22:07,038
I mean, there's a lot of goddamn traffic,
but I'm on my way.

323
00:22:07,163 --> 00:22:10,583
'I don'<i>t</i> give a fuck if there's traffic.
I need you here now!

324
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:14,462
You have to take this shit with you,
so get your ass over here. Right now.

325
00:22:14,587 --> 00:22:18,341
Yes, I know, I know.
Forgive me. I'm on my way.

326
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,773
Maritza, I have to go.
I can'<i>t</i> help you right now.

327
00:22:34,315 --> 00:22:37,861
We already gave you money.
I'll call you later.

328
00:22:37,986 --> 00:22:40,905
And we'll figure it out,
but I can'<i>t</i> right now.

329
00:22:43,241 --> 00:22:45,493
(In English) OK, here we go.

330
00:22:46,703 --> 00:22:49,372
(Engine starts)

331
00:23:47,847 --> 00:23:50,934
(Chatter in Spanish)

332
00:23:54,771 --> 00:23:57,607
(Dialling phone)

333
00:23:59,067 --> 00:24:02,445
- (Man in Spanish) 'Search Bloc.'
- It's Peña.

334
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:04,864
I'm here with Trujillo
at the corner of 38th and 24th streets.

335
00:24:04,989 --> 00:24:06,240
We need back up.

336
00:24:06,366 --> 00:24:08,576
'Sorry, but there's no authorisation
to dispatch patrols.'

337
00:24:08,701 --> 00:24:13,039
We're watching one of Escobar's guys.
He just entered the building.

338
00:24:13,164 --> 00:24:14,749
'Return to base with the location.

339
00:24:14,874 --> 00:24:18,294
'We can ask for authorisation
from Bogotá.'

340
00:24:18,419 --> 00:24:19,837
Sure.

341
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,548
(Mutters) And you'll show up
next Tuesday, son of a bitch.

342
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:29,639
What time were you supposed
to be here, asshole?

343
00:24:29,764 --> 00:24:32,850
You knew you had to make the delivery
before I pick up Lion tomorrow.

344
00:24:32,976 --> 00:24:35,687
No, brother, don'<i>t</i> get mad.
It's just <i>that...</i>

345
00:24:35,812 --> 00:24:36,896
Limón!

346
00:24:37,563 --> 00:24:40,191
You're going to take this goddamn bag
and get out of here now!

347
00:24:40,316 --> 00:24:41,401
I'm watching you.

348
00:24:41,526 --> 00:24:42,819
- Calm down.
- Calm down?

349
00:24:42,944 --> 00:24:46,948
This is the last time you pull shit
like this, Limón. The last time!

350
00:24:49,742 --> 00:24:52,203
- This is the last time you make me <i>wait.</i>
- Come on, man...

351
00:24:52,328 --> 00:24:55,665
- I told you. Get out of here.
- (In English) Oh, shit. That's Velasco.

352
00:24:56,332 --> 00:24:58,626
(In Spanish) Shit. What do we do?

353
00:24:58,751 --> 00:25:01,796
We stick with Velasco.
The other one doesn'<i>t</i> matter.

354
00:25:02,672 --> 00:25:05,425
How many guys
do you think are inside, Peña?

355
00:25:06,759 --> 00:25:08,636
Too many for just us two, no?

356
00:25:08,761 --> 00:25:12,557
Yeah. We'd be screwed.

357
00:25:12,682 --> 00:25:16,185
Son of a bitch.
We should call for backup, right?

358
00:25:20,148 --> 00:25:22,567
(Dials phone)

359
00:25:22,692 --> 00:25:25,528
- Who are you calling?
- (Line ringing)

360
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:52,597
- (Trujillo) What's going on, Peña?
- I'll handle this.

361
00:26:04,233 --> 00:26:08,654
(Javier) This is Trujillo.
You can trust him.

362
00:26:09,989 --> 00:26:11,616
You're finally seeing the light.

363
00:26:12,283 --> 00:26:15,995
Let's just see if this works.

364
00:26:17,413 --> 00:26:18,831
You two coming?

365
00:26:21,918 --> 00:26:25,797
OK, then.
You two, in the front with me.

366
00:26:25,922 --> 00:26:27,840
Berna, with his men, around back.
Understood?

367
00:26:30,009 --> 00:26:32,887
Just stay clear of the windows.

368
00:26:33,012 --> 00:26:35,848
- Let's go, then.
- (Carlos) Let's move.

369
00:27:31,946 --> 00:27:34,198
(Automatic gunfire nearby)

370
00:27:34,323 --> 00:27:36,325
(Men shouting)

371
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:50,256
(Man whimpering)

372
00:27:55,636 --> 00:27:57,138
(Man grunts)

373
00:28:00,057 --> 00:28:01,809
- They're everywhere.
- Let's go down.

374
00:28:24,874 --> 00:28:26,292
Hey!

375
00:28:46,562 --> 00:28:48,064
(Door opens)

376
00:28:56,239 --> 00:28:58,074
(Gunfire)

377
00:29:15,258 --> 00:29:16,259
(Grunts)

378
00:29:20,429 --> 00:29:24,392
Where were you going,
you filthy son of a bitch? Huh?

379
00:29:26,435 --> 00:29:29,021
(Grunts)

380
00:29:33,859 --> 00:29:37,280
(♪ Latin music plays softly on radio)

381
00:29:37,405 --> 00:29:40,533
Here it is, Mrs Escobar.

382
00:29:40,658 --> 00:29:43,452
- What's that?
- It's a delivery.

383
00:29:43,577 --> 00:29:46,414
- But who told you to buy this?
- It was me.

384
00:29:47,456 --> 00:29:49,458
It's some clothes.

385
00:29:50,126 --> 00:29:51,627
Hermilda.

386
00:29:52,545 --> 00:29:56,048
Hermilda, for God's sake... you can'<i>t</i>
send him out with so much money.

387
00:29:56,173 --> 00:29:58,884
- Oh, Tata!
- They are going to know where we are.

388
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:01,345
You worry too much.

389
00:30:02,346 --> 00:30:03,681
It's going to affect the children.

390
00:30:03,806 --> 00:30:06,809
Do you want Juan Pablo
and Manuela to worry?

391
00:30:10,521 --> 00:30:12,023
You're right.

392
00:30:16,068 --> 00:30:18,654
When Pablo was a little boy...

393
00:30:20,823 --> 00:30:24,076
he came home from school one day,
very angry.

394
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:29,540
A little girl made fun of his shoes.

395
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:33,753
They were ragged.

396
00:30:33,878 --> 00:30:37,006
And we didn't have any money
to buy him new ones.

397
00:30:37,131 --> 00:30:42,470
But that night, I went into town
and I stole a pair from a store.

398
00:30:42,595 --> 00:30:45,681
The next day,
Pablo went back to school.

399
00:30:49,935 --> 00:30:54,607
Being poor is not an excuse
to look like you are.

400
00:30:56,734 --> 00:30:59,737
You've always just taken
what you wanted, right?

401
00:30:59,862 --> 00:31:01,530
And Pablo as well.

402
00:31:04,742 --> 00:31:06,285
(In English) Mr Ambassador,

403
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:10,081
I believe people fall
into <i>two</i> categories, basically:

404
00:31:10,206 --> 00:31:12,083
those who rely on hope...

405
00:31:13,125 --> 00:31:15,378
and those who rely on faith,

406
00:31:15,503 --> 00:31:20,091
who see a system at work in the world
and are devoted to <i>it.</i>

407
00:31:20,216 --> 00:31:26,097
It may be religion,
but in the case of police work, a method.

408
00:31:26,222 --> 00:31:29,517
I'm guessing that you fall
on the faith side.

409
00:31:29,642 --> 00:31:30,643
Correct.

410
00:31:31,477 --> 00:31:34,230
We can catch Escobar
in any number of ways.

411
00:31:34,355 --> 00:31:38,943
But if the one we choose
furthers an already strained relationship

412
00:31:39,068 --> 00:31:41,862
between the Colombian people
and its police,

413
00:31:41,987 --> 00:31:46,075
a strain caused by
years of corruption and abuse,

414
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,868
then we'll have lost.

415
00:31:47,993 --> 00:31:49,870
Even if we catch him.

416
00:31:49,995 --> 00:31:53,207
Your philosophy is our philosophy,
Colonel.

417
00:31:53,332 --> 00:31:55,668
Yeah, we'll see about <i>that.</i>

418
00:31:55,793 --> 00:31:56,919
Thank you very much.

419
00:31:58,796 --> 00:32:01,298
- (Crosby) Good to sit down with you.
- Mr Ambassador,

420
00:32:01,424 --> 00:32:04,844
the whole world is watching
how we handle this.

421
00:32:04,969 --> 00:32:10,474
I won'<i>t</i> allow it to be corrupted
by outside interests or darker instincts.

422
00:32:24,155 --> 00:32:25,739
(In Spanish) It worked.

423
00:32:26,532 --> 00:32:28,367
We're even.

424
00:32:29,076 --> 00:32:33,414
I need you to help me get a visa
and get my family out of Medellín.

425
00:32:33,539 --> 00:32:35,541
Somewhere Pablo can't find us.

426
00:32:37,293 --> 00:32:39,128
It doesn'<i>t</i> work like <i>that.</i>

427
00:32:39,962 --> 00:32:40,963
I'm sorry.

428
00:32:41,714 --> 00:32:43,382
So, then...?

429
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,635
How am I supposed to be OK?

430
00:33:14,246 --> 00:33:18,209
Is this how things are going to work
from now on, Peña?

431
00:33:18,334 --> 00:33:23,255
Don'<i>t</i> worry about it, OK?
It won't happen again.

432
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:27,009
- No. I'm not worried.
- (Starts engine)

433
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:39,605
(Don Berna) Leave us.

434
00:33:46,612 --> 00:33:48,948
Life's funny, Velasco.

435
00:33:49,448 --> 00:33:53,452
This could easily
have ended up in reverse.

436
00:33:53,577 --> 00:33:58,832
Me lying there,
you and your men ready to torture me.

437
00:34:00,167 --> 00:34:03,003
Look how everything's changed.

438
00:34:14,765 --> 00:34:17,851
We are both loyal soldiers.

439
00:34:21,689 --> 00:34:25,109
Serving our generals.

440
00:34:25,734 --> 00:34:27,987
But you know what?

441
00:34:29,321 --> 00:34:32,491
When it's time to give up your boss...

442
00:34:33,075 --> 00:34:35,786
(Grunts, breathing heavily)

443
00:34:35,911 --> 00:34:38,080
...we give up our boss.

444
00:34:38,205 --> 00:34:40,958
(Screaming)

445
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:50,801
Ma'am, nothing about Pablo, but...
he gave up this.

446
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:04,064
- Three of his accountants.
- And their addresses.

447
00:35:04,189 --> 00:35:08,277
He also told me Pablo
still has a large army and a lot of money.

448
00:35:08,402 --> 00:35:11,780
Yes, but that could be complete bullshit,
no? To scare us off.

449
00:35:13,574 --> 00:35:17,161
Or it could be true.
To scare us off.

450
00:35:22,499 --> 00:35:24,001
(Sighs)

451
00:35:24,877 --> 00:35:27,254
There lies the key.

452
00:35:27,379 --> 00:35:31,800
If we leave him without money,
we leave him without an army.

453
00:35:31,925 --> 00:35:33,344
Something else.

454
00:35:33,469 --> 00:35:35,512
Velasco was going to the airport
tomorrow

455
00:35:35,638 --> 00:35:39,892
because the Lion will be arriving
in the afternoon from Miami.

456
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:46,273
(People chuckling, chattering nearby)

457
00:35:46,398 --> 00:35:49,985
Excuse me, sir.
It's Judy Moncada.

458
00:35:58,285 --> 00:36:00,120
Mrs Moncada.

459
00:36:01,497 --> 00:36:03,499
How can I help you?

460
00:36:20,557 --> 00:36:24,561
How was your trip?
You must be beat.

461
00:36:24,687 --> 00:36:26,188
(In English) Let's go. Get in.

462
00:36:26,313 --> 00:36:27,815
(In Spanish) Where's Velasco?

463
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,741
(Whistles softly)

464
00:36:49,378 --> 00:36:50,879
There he is.

465
00:36:52,089 --> 00:36:53,924
Welcome.

466
00:36:54,675 --> 00:36:58,095
- Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela.
- Lion.

467
00:36:58,721 --> 00:37:00,723
This is my brother, Miguel.

468
00:37:00,848 --> 00:37:03,350
And this gentleman is our associate,
Pacho Herrera.

469
00:37:03,475 --> 00:37:07,062
I'm very pleased to meet you, gentlemen.
It's a pleasure.

470
00:37:07,813 --> 00:37:10,482
Lion... May I call you that?

471
00:37:10,607 --> 00:37:14,445
- Yes, sir.
- Have a drink. Relax.

472
00:37:16,113 --> 00:37:19,199
They say, over there,
that you like whiskey.

473
00:37:20,492 --> 00:37:23,996
Listen, gentlemen,
if I did something to offend you, <i>or...</i>

474
00:37:24,121 --> 00:37:29,877
What? Would we offer you a drink
if we were offended?

475
00:37:31,378 --> 00:37:32,463
Have a seat.

476
00:37:44,558 --> 00:37:47,311
Tell me something, Lion.

477
00:37:47,436 --> 00:37:49,980
Do you like working for a thug?

478
00:37:57,154 --> 00:37:58,405
(Pablo) 'One...'

479
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:02,367
- two, three! (Chuckles)
- (Laughing)

480
00:38:02,493 --> 00:38:04,661
- Very good.
- (Men murmuring)

481
00:38:04,787 --> 00:38:06,371
Good job.

482
00:38:06,497 --> 00:38:08,248
Look after your sister.

483
00:38:13,462 --> 00:38:14,963
What happened?

484
00:38:15,088 --> 00:38:16,840
(Blackie) Hey, boss...

485
00:38:17,925 --> 00:38:19,927
Lion just called, sir.

486
00:38:20,052 --> 00:38:23,722
He said Velasco never showed up
at the airport, sir.

487
00:38:23,847 --> 00:38:28,519
Lion got scared shitless and left.
He took a plane back to Miami.

488
00:38:28,644 --> 00:38:32,564
Fucking Lion.
Is he a little bitch or what, brother?

489
00:38:32,689 --> 00:38:37,277
- And where is Velasco?
- Boss, I have no idea.

490
00:38:38,612 --> 00:38:40,614
Find him for me.

491
00:38:40,739 --> 00:38:42,658
Right away, boss.

492
00:38:47,329 --> 00:38:49,581
(♪ Upbeat Latin music plays on radio)

493
00:38:53,627 --> 00:38:55,337
(Carlos) I can'<i>t</i> believe you're cooking.

494
00:38:55,462 --> 00:38:58,090
But you know I always helped
my mother.

495
00:38:58,215 --> 00:39:00,759
Uh-uh. I helped while you ate.

496
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:03,512
(Carlos chuckles)

497
00:39:04,346 --> 00:39:08,809
You know, I'm very happy
that Pablo brought me here.

498
00:39:08,934 --> 00:39:10,894
But I'm worried about you.

499
00:39:11,019 --> 00:39:13,939
No. There's no reason to worry.

500
00:39:14,064 --> 00:39:15,816
For God's sake, Tata.

501
00:39:15,941 --> 00:39:18,819
Every cop in the country
is looking for Pablo.

502
00:39:19,528 --> 00:39:22,739
Every drug trafficker
who's not from Medellín wants him dead.

503
00:39:22,865 --> 00:39:26,285
And you're telling me there's no reason
to worry? Don'<i>t</i> kid yourself.

504
00:39:28,370 --> 00:39:30,581
Today is a good day, Carlos.

505
00:39:30,706 --> 00:39:34,126
My family is all together.
You're here.

506
00:39:38,005 --> 00:39:41,758
Pablo is a strong man.
He's always had to be.

507
00:39:42,593 --> 00:39:44,928
There's no reason
to change anything now.

508
00:39:56,064 --> 00:39:58,150
I hope you're hungry.

509
00:40:02,738 --> 00:40:04,239
(Knocking)

510
00:40:11,788 --> 00:40:13,874
Come inside, I'm packing.

511
00:40:13,999 --> 00:40:17,127
Are you going to let me go to Medellín
or what?

512
00:40:17,252 --> 00:40:19,254
Is that why you accepted the job?

513
00:40:19,379 --> 00:40:21,757
You never should have volunteered.

514
00:40:21,882 --> 00:40:26,094
But you can'<i>t</i> be reassigned now,
because it would end your career, right?

515
00:40:26,219 --> 00:40:28,847
Sure, only now I'm gonna be
"the boss's son."

516
00:40:28,972 --> 00:40:30,807
(Sighs)

517
00:40:32,142 --> 00:40:34,478
It appears to me you don'<i>t</i> understand
what's happening.

518
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,273
I accepted because I wanted
to help my country.

519
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,945
Come here,
I want to show you something.

520
00:40:47,532 --> 00:40:50,243
I received this urn with my name.

521
00:40:53,372 --> 00:40:56,375
Look.
On behalf of Pablo Escobar.

522
00:40:58,794 --> 00:41:00,879
It's an obituary.

523
00:41:02,756 --> 00:41:06,510
Look, son, you're going to do
exactly as I tell you.

524
00:41:07,386 --> 00:41:10,597
I'm going to make sure you survive this.
Understand?

525
00:41:16,645 --> 00:41:19,314
(In English) We're polishing
this bottle off pretty fast.

526
00:41:19,439 --> 00:41:22,943
Listen, I am not missing my flight
for anything tomorrow.

527
00:41:23,068 --> 00:41:24,820
Mmm?

528
00:41:25,278 --> 00:41:26,780
No.

529
00:41:28,782 --> 00:41:30,951
You sure you can'<i>t</i> stay?

530
00:41:33,245 --> 00:41:36,748
I can'<i>t</i> leave Olivia
with my sister forever, Steve.

531
00:41:37,332 --> 00:41:40,627
- Anyway, you'll be in Medellín.
- Ah.

532
00:41:40,752 --> 00:41:44,423
You know, I met
the new head of Search Bloc.

533
00:41:44,548 --> 00:41:46,800
- Yeah?
- He's an interesting guy.

534
00:41:47,718 --> 00:41:50,137
I have a good feeling about him.

535
00:41:52,931 --> 00:41:55,934
Before I forget, I want you...

536
00:41:56,810 --> 00:41:59,229
I want you to give this
to Olivia.

537
00:42:02,399 --> 00:42:03,567
Meant to be good luck.

538
00:42:07,738 --> 00:42:09,239
You keep it then.

539
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:18,415
I am gonna miss you.

540
00:42:22,002 --> 00:42:23,336
(In Spanish) From now on,

541
00:42:23,462 --> 00:42:26,757
the Search Bloc is going to operate
in a more systematic fashion.

542
00:42:28,675 --> 00:42:32,429
Since we unfortunately cannot
rely on the information given to us

543
00:42:32,554 --> 00:42:34,556
by the people of Medellín...

544
00:42:35,432 --> 00:42:39,686
we are going to implement
a quadrant search.

545
00:42:41,063 --> 00:42:42,898
We will position ourselves
in the neighbourhoods

546
00:42:43,023 --> 00:42:46,401
where we believe Escobar
and his allies might be,

547
00:42:46,526 --> 00:42:49,780
proceed to search them...

548
00:42:50,697 --> 00:42:53,116
and if we don'<i>t</i> find
what we're looking for,

549
00:42:53,241 --> 00:42:56,745
we'll process anything of value
and continue on to the next one.

550
00:42:57,537 --> 00:43:01,041
- Understood?
- (All) Yes, Colonel!

551
00:43:02,918 --> 00:43:05,420
(In English) A fucking grid search?

552
00:43:05,545 --> 00:43:07,881
Isn'<i>t that</i> how they caught the guy
who shot Abraham Lincoln?

553
00:43:08,006 --> 00:43:11,593
- It's a change.
- Yeah, it's dated and conventional.

554
00:43:14,054 --> 00:43:17,182
Well, we tried going
bullet for bullet with him,

555
00:43:17,307 --> 00:43:19,643
and you saw how that ended up.

556
00:43:21,061 --> 00:43:22,896
Oh, so that's it?

557
00:43:23,021 --> 00:43:25,440
A week ago you volunteered
to jump into a chopper with Carrillo

558
00:43:25,565 --> 00:43:27,067
and now it's a change?

559
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:31,988
Don'<i>t</i> worry about it, man.

560
00:43:32,114 --> 00:43:33,949
We'll all feel better
once Escobar's in the ground

561
00:43:34,074 --> 00:43:37,077
- one way or another, right?
- There is no other way, Javi.

562
00:43:37,202 --> 00:43:39,955
Search Bloc is the only game in town.

563
00:43:41,873 --> 00:43:44,626
You really think this asshole
can get it done?

564
00:43:44,751 --> 00:43:47,587
I don'<i>t</i> know.
Maybe he'll surprise us.

565
00:43:49,422 --> 00:43:50,924
OK.

566
00:43:52,384 --> 00:43:54,219
Grid search it is.

567
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:06,231
(Sighs)

568
00:44:10,569 --> 00:44:13,155
(In Spanish) What did you find out
from Velasco?

569
00:44:15,448 --> 00:44:17,868
Not a fucking thing.

570
00:44:17,993 --> 00:44:21,746
That son of a bitch turned out to be
a lot tougher than I thought.

571
00:44:35,886 --> 00:44:38,388
Is that what I think it is?

572
00:44:43,143 --> 00:44:46,021
Rules of the game:

573
00:44:46,146 --> 00:44:50,567
we only go after armed people.
<i>Sicarios.</i>

574
00:44:51,401 --> 00:44:56,907
There won'<i>t</i> be any information
about businesses or labs or shipments.

575
00:44:57,032 --> 00:44:59,826
This isn'<i>t</i> about helping Judy.

576
00:44:59,951 --> 00:45:02,412
This is about killing Pablo.

577
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,795
Well, then...

578
00:45:12,923 --> 00:45:15,550
here's to killing Pablo.

579
00:45:15,675 --> 00:45:17,469
(Chatter in Spanish)

580
00:45:17,594 --> 00:45:21,389
(Steve) 'Of course, Peña knew
the information he had given Berna

581
00:45:21,514 --> 00:45:22,933

591

I don'<i>t</i> know, boss. If I knew,
I'd kill the son of a bitch that did <i>it.</i>

604

Boss, I'm so sorry,
but La Quica's on the phone.

- And Velasco?
- 'It looks like a battlefield, boss.'

606
00:47:46,284 --> 00:47:51,581
No one's seen Velasco

grabbed Velasco...

Yes.

00:48:06,471 --> 00:48:08,723

Pardon me.

617

Should we start?

(Hermilda) Dig in, dig in.

619
00:48:55,019 --> 00:48:56,020
So good.

620
00:48:56,146 --> 00:48:57,230
(Whispers) A spoon?

621
00:48:57,730 --> 00:49:00,567
There's no spoon, love.
How about a fork?

'Pablo's enemies
had found their own method.

'They had opened up
a new war against him,

No one can know
we had anything to do with this.

(Steve) 'And the moment
