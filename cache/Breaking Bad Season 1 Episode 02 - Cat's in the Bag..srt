2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,419
Are you okay?

3
00:01:54,886 --> 00:01:56,721
- You are a lifesaver.
- Yeah, man.

4
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:59,516
- We can't thank you enough.
- No, hey, mad props.

5
00:01:59,724 --> 00:02:01,601
I could have sworn the guy said south.

6
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:04,354
But then all of a sudden
we're off the main road.

7
00:02:04,563 --> 00:02:07,524
I'm trying to read the map while
driving, a bonehead maneuver.

8
00:02:07,732 --> 00:02:10,652
And then all of a sudden, bam,
we're in that ditch.

9
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,405
Yeah, bam. I'm like,
"What the hell?" You know?

10
00:02:13,613 --> 00:02:17,284
Yes. Oh, yes, and my coffee mug.
Of coffee? My mug of coffee.

11
00:02:17,492 --> 00:02:21,246
It spills all over my pants, I mean...
Just a nightmare.

12
00:02:21,454 --> 00:02:24,374
There's your Sony GPS,
I mean, for real.

13
00:02:38,805 --> 00:02:40,515
Let's just...

14
00:02:47,063 --> 00:02:51,776
Like I said,
we couldn't be more grateful.

15
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,710
Can't we just dump them here?

16
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:10,754
What, and somebody finds them?

17
00:03:10,962 --> 00:03:12,005
Then what?

18
00:03:12,213 --> 00:03:14,674
People have seen us.

19
00:03:20,513 --> 00:03:22,015
Hey, you're gonna flood it, man.

20
00:03:22,223 --> 00:03:24,893
I'm not gonna flood it.
She's not gonna flood, all right?

21
00:03:25,101 --> 00:03:27,437
We're just gonna stay positive, right?

22
00:03:27,646 --> 00:03:29,231
We're gonna clean up this mess.

23
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:31,274
And you, start.

24
00:03:31,858 --> 00:03:33,818
Goddamn it. See, you flooded it.

25
00:03:34,027 --> 00:03:35,320
All right.

26
00:03:35,528 --> 00:03:39,032
All right. You know what?
The RV is going to start now.

27
00:03:39,241 --> 00:03:40,867
The RV is going to start right now.

28
00:03:41,076 --> 00:03:43,536
It's gonna start.
We're gonna drive it to your house.

29
00:03:43,745 --> 00:03:44,788
- My house?
- Your house.

30
00:03:44,996 --> 00:03:47,540
We're gonna drive it over there
and park it overnight.

31
00:03:47,749 --> 00:03:50,085
- And then tomorrow...
- Man, not my house.

32
00:03:50,293 --> 00:03:53,880
Shut up. Shut up.

33
00:04:05,517 --> 00:04:09,020
After we finish
cleaning up this mess...

34
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:11,273
...we will go our separate ways.

35
00:04:11,481 --> 00:04:14,317
Our paths will never cross.

36
00:04:14,526 --> 00:04:16,778
And we will tell this to no one.

37
00:04:16,987 --> 00:04:18,780
Understood?

38
00:04:21,408 --> 00:04:23,118
Oh, what, I can talk now?

39
00:04:24,202 --> 00:04:28,623
Fine. That goes double for me.

40
00:04:31,793 --> 00:04:34,504
Okay. Okay.

41
00:04:34,713 --> 00:04:36,506
Be good to me.

42
00:04:42,012 --> 00:04:43,430
Yes!

43
00:04:48,518 --> 00:04:50,729
Yes. Okay. Okay.

44
00:04:51,229 --> 00:04:52,314
Thank you.

45
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:13,960
Oh, shit.

46
00:05:41,613 --> 00:05:43,365
Walt?

47
00:05:45,575 --> 00:05:47,744
You coming out?

48
00:05:56,211 --> 00:05:58,630
Yeah, absolutely.

49
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:01,591
<i>We've got looky-loos
in both directions, Dan.</i>

50
00:06:01,841 --> 00:06:04,219
<i>Better plan on being late
if you're going to work.</i>

51
00:06:04,678 --> 00:06:09,015
<i>This is Lisa in the Skycopter, we'll have
more Albuquerque traffic on the hour.</i>

52
00:06:10,475 --> 00:06:13,228
Hey, you wanna hear
something funny?

53
00:06:15,272 --> 00:06:18,024
We had a faculty meeting
last Thursday...

54
00:06:18,233 --> 00:06:21,861
...and the topic was
senior-class photos...

55
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:24,656
...and how we had instituted
a new rule last year...

56
00:06:24,864 --> 00:06:27,784
...that seniors are allowed
to have photos taken...

57
00:06:27,993 --> 00:06:30,161
...by a photographer of their choice.

58
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:32,789
You know, not necessarily
the photographer...

59
00:06:32,998 --> 00:06:35,667
...that the school hires, right? So...

60
00:06:37,085 --> 00:06:40,505
So anyway,
some of the senior girls...

61
00:06:40,714 --> 00:06:45,760
...were going to that Glamor Shots
place to have their photos taken.

62
00:06:45,969 --> 00:06:49,389
And now they're bringing us
all these photos...

63
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:51,516
...and Joan Everman...
You know Joan.

64
00:06:51,725 --> 00:06:53,810
- Suddenly has to go through
all the photos...

65
00:06:54,019 --> 00:06:57,689
...and turn them down
because they show cleavage.

66
00:07:01,234 --> 00:07:03,653
Did you get enough
pancakes, sweetie?

67
00:07:03,904 --> 00:07:05,780
Yeah. I'm good.

68
00:07:05,989 --> 00:07:07,115
Okay.

69
00:07:07,324 --> 00:07:11,703
You know, even the
small-busted girls have cleavage.

70
00:07:11,912 --> 00:07:18,043
Apparently there's some new type of
brassiere or something.

71
00:07:18,501 --> 00:07:19,878
The Wonderbra.

72
00:07:21,046 --> 00:07:23,131
It's the Wonderbra.

73
00:07:23,465 --> 00:07:24,925
Yeah?

74
00:07:25,717 --> 00:07:27,719
Okay.

75
00:07:31,306 --> 00:07:34,601
<i>Hey there. You've reached Walt,
Skyler and Walter Jr.</i>

76
00:07:34,809 --> 00:07:38,188
<i>We can't come to the phone right now,
so please leave us a message.</i>

77
00:07:38,396 --> 00:07:41,733
<i>Hello, Mr. White.
This is AT& T calling.</i>

78
00:07:41,942 --> 00:07:44,986
<i>Are you happy with your current
long-distance service?</i>

79
00:07:45,195 --> 00:07:48,281
<i>Because if you're not,
I would definitely really, really love...</i>

80
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:50,659
<i>...to talk to you
as soon as possible about...</i>

81
00:07:50,867 --> 00:07:52,744
Hello, this is Walter White speaking.

82
00:07:52,953 --> 00:07:54,955
You said he was
practically dead, okay?

83
00:07:55,163 --> 00:07:56,790
You said he would die any minute.

84
00:07:56,998 --> 00:08:00,252
Listen, I am having breakfast
with my family right now...

85
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:03,380
...and I really don't appreciate
these sales calls.

86
00:08:03,588 --> 00:08:05,966
<i>Well, too bad, man,
because guess what.</i>

87
00:08:06,174 --> 00:08:07,384
<i>He's still not dead.</i>

88
00:08:07,592 --> 00:08:09,261
I went and put my ear to the RV.

89
00:08:09,469 --> 00:08:12,472
I can hear him, like,
rolling around in there, all right?

90
00:08:12,681 --> 00:08:15,934
I think he's awake, man.
I think he's trying to get loose.

91
00:08:16,142 --> 00:08:18,270
<i>Where the hell are you?
I'm freaking out here.</i>

92
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:21,189
- Calm down, damn it.
<i>- You gonna help me clean this up?</i>

93
00:08:21,398 --> 00:08:24,484
- We got loose ends here.
- Calm down.

94
00:08:24,693 --> 00:08:26,278
I will be there after school.

95
00:08:26,486 --> 00:08:28,530
<i>After school. Are you shitting me?</i>

96
00:08:28,863 --> 00:08:30,740
Ditch it, man. Call in sick.

97
00:08:31,283 --> 00:08:33,577
Listen, that is just
not gonna work for me.

98
00:08:33,785 --> 00:08:35,412
I'm not interested in that at all.

99
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:38,915
And I would appreciate it
if you don't call here anymore.

100
00:08:39,124 --> 00:08:42,627
Damn. They're so annoying,
those people.

101
00:08:46,798 --> 00:08:50,218
- You have a good day, sweetie.
- Okay, Mom. You too.

102
00:08:50,427 --> 00:08:52,137
Bye, honey.

103
00:08:56,808 --> 00:08:59,102
- Drive safe.
- Okay.

104
00:09:11,031 --> 00:09:16,286
<i>Yo, yo, yo, 1, 4, 8, 3 to the 3
to the 6 to the 9, representing the ABQ.</i>

105
00:09:16,494 --> 00:09:20,123
<i>What up, beyotch?
Leave it at the tone.</i>

106
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:38,934
So the term "chiral"...

107
00:09:39,142 --> 00:09:42,479
...derives from the
Greek word "hand."

108
00:09:43,104 --> 00:09:48,652
Now, the concept here being that just
as your left hand and your right hand...

109
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:53,281
...are mirror images of one another,
right, identical and yet opposite...

110
00:09:53,698 --> 00:09:56,368
...well, so, too,
organic compounds can exist...

111
00:09:56,576 --> 00:10:00,288
...as mirror-image forms
of one another...

112
00:10:00,497 --> 00:10:02,499
...all the way down
at the molecular level.

113
00:10:02,707 --> 00:10:06,294
But although they may
look the same...

114
00:10:07,629 --> 00:10:09,839
...they don't always behave the same.

115
00:10:10,048 --> 00:10:12,175
For instance...

116
00:10:14,886 --> 00:10:16,596
For instance.

117
00:10:18,431 --> 00:10:20,934
I'm sorry. For instance...

118
00:10:21,142 --> 00:10:22,686
Thalidomide.

119
00:10:22,894 --> 00:10:27,607
The right-handed isomer
of the drug thalidomide...

120
00:10:27,816 --> 00:10:29,734
...is a perfectly fine, good medicine...

121
00:10:29,943 --> 00:10:32,821
...to give to a pregnant woman
to prevent morning sickness.

122
00:10:33,029 --> 00:10:36,741
But make the mistake of giving
that same pregnant woman...

123
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:41,288
...the left-handed isomer
of the drug thalidomide...

124
00:10:41,496 --> 00:10:47,127
...and her child will be born
with horrible birth defects.

125
00:10:48,211 --> 00:10:51,673
Which is precisely what happened
in the 1950s.

126
00:10:51,881 --> 00:10:58,054
So chiral, chirality,
mirrored images, right?

127
00:10:58,263 --> 00:11:02,767
Active, inactive, good, bad.

128
00:11:06,146 --> 00:11:07,480
So.

129
00:11:07,689 --> 00:11:10,483
- Yes, Ben.
- Is this gonna be on the murder?

130
00:11:13,445 --> 00:11:14,487
What?

131
00:11:14,696 --> 00:11:17,115
Is this gonna be on the midterm?

132
00:11:20,452 --> 00:11:23,204
Chirality on the midterm?
No, no. Well, maybe.

133
00:11:23,413 --> 00:11:27,626
Maybe. Yes, you know...
But prepare for it to be on the midterm.

134
00:11:27,834 --> 00:11:30,045
Can't hurt to know it, right? So...

135
00:11:30,253 --> 00:11:32,505
Knowledge is power.

136
00:12:47,956 --> 00:12:50,584
Oh, no. Oh, no, no. No.

137
00:12:58,133 --> 00:13:00,010
Not good. Not good, not good.

138
00:13:18,653 --> 00:13:20,488
What the...?

139
00:13:40,675 --> 00:13:43,803
Hey. Hey. Hey, you.

140
00:13:44,012 --> 00:13:45,805
Hey, listen, you.

141
00:13:46,014 --> 00:13:47,682
No, no, no!

142
00:13:51,937 --> 00:13:53,230
Oh, God.

143
00:14:39,818 --> 00:14:41,152
Okay.

144
00:14:57,377 --> 00:14:59,254
MILFs?

145
00:15:00,005 --> 00:15:01,756
The hell is a MILF?

146
00:15:21,693 --> 00:15:23,403
Now what?

147
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:29,117
Lock the other one out in the RV.

148
00:15:29,326 --> 00:15:31,077
He's:

149
00:15:31,286 --> 00:15:32,412
- You're sure?
- Yes.

150
00:15:32,621 --> 00:15:34,122
- You're positive?
- You know what?

151
00:15:34,331 --> 00:15:36,958
- Feel free to go check.
- Good idea. Maybe I should...

152
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:39,377
...before he, too, wanders off
down the street.

153
00:15:39,586 --> 00:15:41,963
- Okay, you know what? I am sick...
- All right.

154
00:15:42,172 --> 00:15:43,548
Just...

155
00:15:43,757 --> 00:15:46,551
The one downstairs,
tell me about him.

156
00:15:47,093 --> 00:15:50,221
Oh, come on. Anything. Something.
Start with his name, at least.

157
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:51,723
Krazy-8.

158
00:15:51,932 --> 00:15:54,517
Krazy-8.
What the hell does that even mean?

159
00:15:54,726 --> 00:15:59,314
I don't know, man, okay? It means,
like, Krazy-8, okay? I don't know.

160
00:15:59,522 --> 00:16:02,442
So you work with him regularly.

161
00:16:02,651 --> 00:16:04,611
No, not him so much.

162
00:16:04,819 --> 00:16:07,489
- His cousin, mainly.
- Who's his cousin?

163
00:16:07,697 --> 00:16:10,533
- The guy out in the RV.
- All right, all right, all right.

164
00:16:10,742 --> 00:16:13,245
Krazy-8's one level higher.

165
00:16:13,453 --> 00:16:14,913
One level higher.

166
00:16:15,121 --> 00:16:18,750
Yeah, you know.
Not, like, street level. Higher.

167
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,795
You know how there's, like,
a Starbucks on every corner?

168
00:16:22,003 --> 00:16:25,632
Krazy-8 is like the dude that sells
Starbucks' beans.

169
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,425
Okay, so he's a distributor.

170
00:16:29,261 --> 00:16:33,014
Okay, so is he? I mean, is?

171
00:16:33,223 --> 00:16:37,811
In other words,
what is his reputation for violence?

172
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:43,233
Well, he did try to kill us both
yesterday, so there's that.

173
00:16:43,441 --> 00:16:46,736
Look, what I'm trying to say
is that he's a distributor, right?

174
00:16:46,945 --> 00:16:50,365
He's a businessman.
He's a man of business.

175
00:16:50,574 --> 00:16:52,784
It would therefore
seem to follow that he is...

176
00:16:52,993 --> 00:16:56,746
...capable of acting out of
mutual self-interest, yes?

177
00:16:57,414 --> 00:16:58,456
What?

178
00:16:58,665 --> 00:17:03,336
Do you think he is capable
of listening to reason?

179
00:17:04,421 --> 00:17:07,257
What kind of reason? You mean,
"Dear Krazy-8, hey, listen...

180
00:17:07,465 --> 00:17:11,136
...if I let you go, you promise not to
come back and waste my entire family?

181
00:17:11,344 --> 00:17:13,680
No Colombian neckties?"
That kind of reason?

182
00:17:13,889 --> 00:17:17,642
No, man, I can't say as I have high
fucking hopes where that's concerned.

183
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,650
What was that?

184
00:17:26,318 --> 00:17:27,819
What was what?

185
00:17:35,201 --> 00:17:36,828
We didn't tie him up.

186
00:17:37,037 --> 00:17:39,748
- Why the hell didn't we tie him up?
- Oh, God.

187
00:17:39,956 --> 00:17:43,627
- Because he was out cold.
- Yeah, but what if he's faking it?

188
00:17:43,835 --> 00:17:48,089
You know, like, if it was me,
I'd be all faking being knocked out, yo.

189
00:17:48,381 --> 00:17:52,761
And then, when the coast is clear,
I'd be up looking for weapons and shit.

190
00:17:52,969 --> 00:17:55,096
Ready to pounce.

191
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,497
No, see. Now, if it was me...

192
00:18:20,705 --> 00:18:23,208
...and I couldn't find
a decent enough weapon...

193
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:27,045
...I would just lie back down
and bide my time.

194
00:19:20,307 --> 00:19:23,184
So now what do we do?

195
00:19:27,022 --> 00:19:33,695
You keep asking me that
like you think I have some answer.

196
00:19:34,362 --> 00:19:36,781
- Well, you gotta do something.
- We.

197
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:40,243
We have got to do something,
and I am open to suggestions.

198
00:19:40,452 --> 00:19:42,913
Man, okay,
this whole thing was your deal.

199
00:19:43,121 --> 00:19:44,915
Don't you dare put that on me.

200
00:19:45,123 --> 00:19:48,376
You brought those guys out there.
This is your responsibility.

201
00:19:48,585 --> 00:19:50,879
Like I came to you,
begging to cook meth.

202
00:19:51,087 --> 00:19:55,508
"Oh, hey, nerdiest old dude I know,
you wanna come cook crystal?" Please.

203
00:19:55,717 --> 00:19:57,385
I'd ask my diaper-wearing granny...

204
00:19:57,594 --> 00:20:00,347
...but her wheelchair wouldn't fit
in the RV.

205
00:20:06,603 --> 00:20:09,564
What about the phosphate gas?

206
00:20:09,773 --> 00:20:12,275
Phosphine gas. What about it?

207
00:20:12,484 --> 00:20:15,070
I mean, do you think
it still might kill him?

208
00:20:15,278 --> 00:20:17,822
You know, with, like,
a delayed reaction or something?

209
00:20:20,575 --> 00:20:21,618
I don't know.

210
00:20:21,826 --> 00:20:24,287
- You're supposed to be a scientist.
- Look.

211
00:20:24,496 --> 00:20:28,750
This isn't even the issue
that demands immediate attention.

212
00:20:28,959 --> 00:20:32,379
We have got a body in that RV.
And it's getting warmer outside.

213
00:20:32,587 --> 00:20:33,838
Understand?

214
00:20:34,047 --> 00:20:37,259
And we have got to
do something about that soon.

215
00:20:37,467 --> 00:20:39,719
And in a way that
no one will ever find it.

216
00:20:39,928 --> 00:20:44,724
Now, that last part
is very, very important.

217
00:20:45,225 --> 00:20:49,854
Therefore, it seems to me...

218
00:20:50,063 --> 00:20:55,610
...that our best course of action
would be chemical disincorporation.

219
00:20:58,989 --> 00:21:01,908
Dissolving in strong acid.

220
00:21:08,707 --> 00:21:11,459
Oh, man, that's messed up.

221
00:21:12,544 --> 00:21:15,630
I mean, you're not serious.

222
00:21:17,841 --> 00:21:19,593
You serious?

223
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,518
Well, who's gonna do that?

224
00:21:28,727 --> 00:21:30,604
And don't look at me.

225
00:21:33,148 --> 00:21:35,025
I guess we'll both do it together.

226
00:21:35,233 --> 00:21:38,361
No, Mr. White, okay,
I'm not good with dead bodies.

227
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:43,783
Look, we are in this fifty-fifty. Okay?

228
00:21:46,328 --> 00:21:51,833
I guess the only other fair way
to go about this would be...

229
00:21:52,042 --> 00:21:57,047
...that one of us deals with
the body situation...

230
00:21:57,255 --> 00:22:03,553
...while the other one of us deals with
the Krazy-8 situation.

231
00:22:10,685 --> 00:22:14,147
In a scenario like this,
I don't suppose it is bad form...

232
00:22:14,356 --> 00:22:18,777
...to just flip a coin.

233
00:22:26,534 --> 00:22:30,163
- Heads or tails?
- No, I'll do the body in the acid, okay?

234
00:22:30,747 --> 00:22:33,124
Heads or tails?

235
00:22:41,258 --> 00:22:44,094
Heads. Heads.

236
00:23:01,736 --> 00:23:03,863
Best two out of three?

237
00:23:21,631 --> 00:23:26,887
<i>Yo, yo, yo, 1, 4, 8, 3 to the 3
to the 6 to the 9, representing the ABQ.</i>

238
00:23:27,095 --> 00:23:30,724
<i>What up, beyotch?
Leave it at the tone.</i>

239
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,436
<i>Hey, Mr. White, it's me. Pick up.</i>

240
00:23:34,644 --> 00:23:37,355
<i>I got a container question.</i>

241
00:23:38,356 --> 00:23:41,359
<i>Hello, Mr. White.
Pick up the phone, man.</i>

242
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:43,862
- Yes.
- Yo, what kind of plastic, man?

243
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:47,115
<i>Polyethylene.</i>

244
00:23:47,741 --> 00:23:49,618
How the hell am I
supposed to know that?

245
00:23:49,826 --> 00:23:51,286
Because I told you.

246
00:23:51,494 --> 00:23:58,168
Look, just look at the bottom
for a triangle...

247
00:23:58,376 --> 00:24:00,629
...stamped LDPE.

248
00:24:00,879 --> 00:24:02,714
<i>It should be molded into the plastic.</i>

249
00:24:02,923 --> 00:24:05,425
Yeah, yeah, yeah, LDPE.
Right on, got it.

250
00:24:05,634 --> 00:24:09,930
I don't know, man.
This feels kind of flimsy.

251
00:24:10,138 --> 00:24:12,599
Any decent acid's
gonna eat right through this.

252
00:24:13,183 --> 00:24:15,310
- Not hydrofluoric.
- Why not?

253
00:24:17,604 --> 00:24:21,816
Look, you skipped, clowned around...

254
00:24:22,025 --> 00:24:25,737
...or otherwise jerked off
through every lecture I ever gave.

255
00:24:25,946 --> 00:24:29,157
As far as I'm concerned,
your chemistry education is over.

256
00:24:29,491 --> 00:24:32,827
Oh, okay, be a dick about it. Jesus.

257
00:24:34,579 --> 00:24:39,542
So, hey, have you done the thing?

258
00:24:44,089 --> 00:24:47,759
Yeah, I'm working up to it.

259
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:55,016
You know what?
I bet he doesn't even wake up.

260
00:24:56,059 --> 00:24:59,104
You know, not even if you took him
to the hospital right now.

261
00:25:00,021 --> 00:25:02,566
Now, if it was me,
I would just try and think of it...

262
00:25:02,774 --> 00:25:06,403
...like I was doing him a favour.

263
00:25:31,511 --> 00:25:34,472
<i>I need a check approval
on checkstand eight.</i>

264
00:25:34,681 --> 00:25:38,518
<i>Approval on checkstand eight, please.
Thank you.</i>

265
00:25:51,531 --> 00:25:53,199
Yeah.

266
00:27:18,618 --> 00:27:20,328
Who's there?

267
00:27:24,332 --> 00:27:27,085
What, you fucking break in?
Show me who's there.

268
00:27:31,381 --> 00:27:33,758
Yeah. I see you.

269
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:38,221
What you gonna do?

270
00:27:39,931 --> 00:27:40,974
Hey.

271
00:27:42,475 --> 00:27:43,810
Hey...!

272
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:50,317
Hey.

273
00:27:51,026 --> 00:27:53,111
I need water.

274
00:27:54,112 --> 00:27:56,031
Hey, hello.

275
00:27:57,324 --> 00:27:59,784
Bring me some water, would you?

276
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:03,580
Please.

277
00:29:18,071 --> 00:29:20,031
You don't like the crust?

278
00:29:31,835 --> 00:29:33,044
Where's my cousin Emilio?

279
00:29:38,216 --> 00:29:39,968
He dead?

280
00:30:03,783 --> 00:30:06,036
Oh, I'm a coward.

281
00:31:33,582 --> 00:31:38,295
Hey, Mr. White. Hey, Mr. White?

282
00:31:39,296 --> 00:31:40,422
Oh, fuck.

283
00:31:44,134 --> 00:31:48,096
Are you smoking weed? Oh, my God.

284
00:31:48,597 --> 00:31:51,016
Wait a minute, is that my weed?

285
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:56,646
What the hell, man? Make yourself
at home, why don't you?

286
00:32:00,358 --> 00:32:04,112
- So, what'd you end up buying?
- Nothing.

287
00:32:05,655 --> 00:32:09,659
No store in town sells a plastic bin
big enough for a body.

288
00:32:11,077 --> 00:32:14,581
I don't suppose
you could buy two bins?

289
00:32:14,789 --> 00:32:18,627
And just:

290
00:32:19,044 --> 00:32:21,421
Legs in one, torso in the other?

291
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:24,424
Oh, God.

292
00:32:24,841 --> 00:32:28,011
I don't suppose
you could kiss my ass?

293
00:32:36,311 --> 00:32:38,230
So...

294
00:32:39,522 --> 00:32:41,441
...how'd it go?

295
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:52,118
- You didn't do it?
- Not yet.

296
00:32:52,327 --> 00:32:55,997
Oh, God.

297
00:32:57,415 --> 00:33:00,126
- Oh, damn. I gotta go.
- Hey, hey.

298
00:33:00,377 --> 00:33:03,255
What? No, no, no. Come back here.

299
00:33:03,463 --> 00:33:06,883
- Sorry. I'll do it tomorrow, I promise.
- Tomorrow.

300
00:33:07,133 --> 00:33:09,177
I've got a doctor's appointment.
I gotta go.

301
00:33:09,386 --> 00:33:12,764
Look, stay away from him.
He's awake.

302
00:33:15,642 --> 00:33:18,353
Hey, man, we flipped a coin.

303
00:33:20,021 --> 00:33:22,399
We flipped a coin.

304
00:33:27,737 --> 00:33:29,990
We're good?

305
00:33:30,323 --> 00:33:34,744
We're very good.
We're excellent, I'd say.

306
00:33:37,372 --> 00:33:43,295
Oh, would you look at that face?
Smile, peanut.

307
00:33:47,007 --> 00:33:49,551
So who's up for knowing?

308
00:33:53,179 --> 00:33:55,015
It's...

309
00:33:56,474 --> 00:33:57,517
Yeah.

310
00:33:57,767 --> 00:34:00,604
- Girl.
- Girl?

311
00:34:00,812 --> 00:34:03,857
- You sure?
- Pretty sure.

312
00:34:07,736 --> 00:34:10,697
Oh, God. Can I tell you,
that's exactly what I was hoping.

313
00:34:10,906 --> 00:34:12,574
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

314
00:34:12,824 --> 00:34:15,785
You remember you said that
when she's 16 and starts dating.

315
00:34:17,037 --> 00:34:20,582
Looking fabulous. Let me see
if they're done with the blood sugar...

316
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:24,294
...then we'll get you out of here.
I'll be right back.

317
00:34:51,279 --> 00:34:53,573
Who's Jesse Pinkman?

318
00:35:00,372 --> 00:35:04,209
- Jesse?
- Jesse Pinkman.

319
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:08,588
He called just this morning.

320
00:35:08,838 --> 00:35:11,550
- Walt, please don't deny it.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

321
00:35:11,758 --> 00:35:15,303
It says on his MyShout page
he attended Wynne.

322
00:35:15,512 --> 00:35:18,348
- Was he one of your students?
- Yeah.

323
00:35:18,557 --> 00:35:22,102
He was nobody.

324
00:35:23,436 --> 00:35:27,857
Who is he to you? Why is he calling?
What is this big secret...

325
00:35:28,066 --> 00:35:32,904
...you seem to be discussing
with some druggie burnout?

326
00:35:35,615 --> 00:35:39,327
You don't come home last night until 2
in the morning. You don't tell me...

327
00:35:39,578 --> 00:35:45,000
...where you've been. You spent
the entire night in the bathroom, Walt.

328
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:51,089
Tell me what's going on with you.
Don't you think you owe me that?

329
00:35:54,426 --> 00:35:57,387
Who is this Jesse Pinkman to you?

330
00:36:01,975 --> 00:36:04,477
He sells me pot.

331
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:11,860
- He sells you pot?
- Marijuana, yeah.

332
00:36:12,068 --> 00:36:16,573
Not a lot. I mean, I don't know.

333
00:36:17,991 --> 00:36:20,285
I kind of like it.

334
00:36:20,493 --> 00:36:25,373
Are you out of your mind?
What are you, like, 16 years old?

335
00:36:25,582 --> 00:36:30,754
Your brother-in-law is a DEA agent.
What is wrong with you?

336
00:36:31,212 --> 00:36:34,841
Look, Skyler...

337
00:36:38,261 --> 00:36:42,766
...I just haven't
quite been myself lately.

338
00:36:43,558 --> 00:36:48,021
- Yeah. No shit. Thanks for noticing.
- I haven't been myself lately...

339
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:50,315
...but I love you.

340
00:36:50,941 --> 00:36:56,238
Nothing about that has changed.
Nothing ever will.

341
00:36:56,488 --> 00:36:59,449
So right now, what I need...

342
00:36:59,658 --> 00:37:03,912
...is for you to climb down
out of my ass.

343
00:37:06,998 --> 00:37:10,961
Can you do that?
Will you do that for me, honey?

344
00:37:11,169 --> 00:37:16,591
Will you please, just once,
get off my ass?

345
00:37:17,175 --> 00:37:18,635
You know.

346
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:23,306
I'd appreciate it. I really would.

347
00:37:44,327 --> 00:37:45,662
Stop.

348
00:37:56,715 --> 00:37:59,926
Stop in 15 minutes.

349
00:38:26,328 --> 00:38:28,496
<i>Your face is too sharp.</i>

350
00:38:33,919 --> 00:38:39,549
<i>Powder. Powder!
Take a powder, go on.</i>

351
00:38:42,469 --> 00:38:46,723
<i>Nice. Beautiful talcum powder.
Lucky you, number eight.</i>

352
00:38:49,768 --> 00:38:52,604
Just meat,
it's all just a bunch of meat.

353
00:38:59,277 --> 00:39:01,696
Oh, Jesus.

354
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,327
You're cool, you're cool.

355
00:39:07,535 --> 00:39:11,873
You're all good, you're all...
You're all good. You know it.

356
00:39:12,082 --> 00:39:17,212
It's fine. It's just a bunch of meat.
Come on. You're good.

357
00:39:39,568 --> 00:39:40,735
Excuse me.

358
00:39:42,237 --> 00:39:47,784
Excuse me. You. Yes, you.
May I talk to you?

359
00:39:50,662 --> 00:39:52,664
Hey, hey, hey.
This is private property.

360
00:39:52,914 --> 00:39:55,667
- Just a minute. I wanna talk to you.
- No, not interested.

361
00:39:55,917 --> 00:39:59,921
- Come on.
- Hey, don't touch me. Do not touch me.

362
00:40:00,171 --> 00:40:02,215
All right. Look, not touching.
Not touching.

363
00:40:02,424 --> 00:40:05,093
Look, lady, whatever you're selling,
I ain't buying, yo.

364
00:40:05,302 --> 00:40:11,975
Well, my name is Skyler White, yo.
My husband is Walter White, yo.

365
00:40:13,435 --> 00:40:15,061
He told me everything.

366
00:40:15,812 --> 00:40:18,315
- Seriously?
- That's right.

367
00:40:18,648 --> 00:40:24,779
And just so you know,
my brother-in-law is a DEA agent...

368
00:40:24,988 --> 00:40:30,827
...and I will not hesitate to call him.
Not if I have to. Understood?

369
00:40:31,661 --> 00:40:35,123
This is your one and only warning.

370
00:40:35,373 --> 00:40:39,377
Do not sell marijuana to my husband.

371
00:40:41,588 --> 00:40:45,508
- Okay.
- I mean it. Don't call our house again.

372
00:40:45,717 --> 00:40:50,222
You stay away from him,
or you will be one sorry individual.

373
00:40:51,556 --> 00:40:55,769
- You get me?
- I think so, yeah.

374
00:40:55,977 --> 00:40:59,689
No more marijuana. I can dig it.

375
00:41:00,148 --> 00:41:03,235
You can dig it. Wonderful.

376
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:17,165
Not that it's any of my business,
but you might wanna consider...

377
00:41:17,374 --> 00:41:19,334
...a different line of work.

378
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,544
Okay.

379
00:42:15,432 --> 00:42:19,144
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Let's go to your house, you know.

380
00:42:20,145 --> 00:42:26,484
Makes perfect sense. Let's
completely screw up your house...

381
00:42:26,693 --> 00:42:31,448
...so you never wanna spend another
night in it. Sure. You know, why not?

382
00:42:36,328 --> 00:42:39,789
Yeah, and how's about
I send over my psycho-bitch wife...

383
00:42:39,998 --> 00:42:42,709
...to, you know, break your balls
and threaten you?

384
00:42:42,959 --> 00:42:44,878
God, that would be hilarious,
you know.

385
00:42:45,086 --> 00:42:47,380
And then, you know,
the killer in the basement...

386
00:42:47,589 --> 00:42:50,675
...the one who's completely
my responsibility...

387
00:42:50,884 --> 00:42:54,095
...hell, let's just
let him live down there.

388
00:42:54,304 --> 00:42:59,851
Just, I don't know, make sure
to feed him, like, three times a day.

389
00:43:01,478 --> 00:43:06,107
Sure, why not? It's been really amazing.
Thank you so much for the opportunity.

390
00:43:06,608 --> 00:43:10,987
I always dreamt about, I don't know,
melting bodies.

391
00:43:34,219 --> 00:43:36,638
You got a brother
in the goddamn DEA?

392
00:43:40,809 --> 00:43:42,143
- What?
- You said you were...

393
00:43:42,352 --> 00:43:47,023
...just doing some ride-along. Yes or
no, do you have a brother in the DEA?

394
00:43:47,691 --> 00:43:51,861
- He's a brother-in-law.
- Well, there's a load off my mind.

395
00:43:52,112 --> 00:43:53,238
Where did you hear that?

396
00:43:53,863 --> 00:43:57,325
Your freaking wife told me
when she was here all up in my shit.

397
00:43:57,701 --> 00:44:01,413
Yeah, that's right.
She almost caught me moving Emilio.

398
00:44:02,455 --> 00:44:04,708
Good job on
wearing the pants in the family.

399
00:44:05,292 --> 00:44:07,961
And why'd you go and tell her
I was selling you weed?

400
00:44:09,588 --> 00:44:11,965
Because somehow
it seemed preferable...

401
00:44:12,173 --> 00:44:16,595
...to admitting that I cook crystal meth
and killed a man.

402
00:44:25,228 --> 00:44:26,646
Is that what I think it is?

403
00:44:26,897 --> 00:44:30,525
Yeah. Yeah, it is. I smoked a bowl.
So what? My house, my rules.

404
00:44:31,151 --> 00:44:33,028
Hey, no, no.
Don't give me that, okay?

405
00:44:33,236 --> 00:44:37,741
I held up my end. I already took care of
Emilio. You're still diddling around...

406
00:44:37,949 --> 00:44:40,410
- ...trying to get your nut up.
- Yeah, well, boo-hoo.

407
00:44:40,619 --> 00:44:42,537
I have the truly awful job here.

408
00:44:42,746 --> 00:44:44,789
You wanna talk awful?
You wanna go there?

409
00:44:44,998 --> 00:44:49,127
Try dragging 200 pounds of stink
up a flight of stairs.

410
00:44:49,336 --> 00:44:51,546
I barely got him in the bathtub.

411
00:44:52,047 --> 00:44:55,175
Bathtub, what?
What do you mean, bathtub?

412
00:44:55,383 --> 00:44:57,969
Another thing. Why you got me
running around town...

413
00:44:58,178 --> 00:45:00,472
...trying to find
some stupid piece of plastic...

414
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,891
...when I have a perfectly good tub
I can use?

415
00:45:06,645 --> 00:45:09,064
Oh, God.

416
00:45:09,856 --> 00:45:11,775
Hey. Hey.

417
00:46:06,496 --> 00:46:10,041
I'm sorry, what were you asking me?
Oh, yes.

418
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:14,462
That stupid plastic container
I asked you to buy.

419
00:46:14,671 --> 00:46:18,258
You see, hydrofluoric acid
won't eat through plastic.

420
00:46:18,466 --> 00:46:24,973
It will, however, dissolve metal,
rock, glass, ceramic.

421
00:46:25,181 --> 00:46:27,309
So there's that.

422
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:46,286
Okay, here we go.

423
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:55,003
Okay.

424
00:47:00,467 --> 00:47:02,344
Here I go.

425
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,800
