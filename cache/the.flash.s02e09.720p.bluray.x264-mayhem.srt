1
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:06,674
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:10,056
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

3
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:12,972
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

4
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:16,563
I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,477
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

6
00:00:18,644 --> 00:00:21,443
but in doing so,
I opened up our world to new threats.

7
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:25,276
And I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

8
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:27,820
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:30,205
Previously on The Flash...

10
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:32,453
You're just letting us go?

11
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:36,041
Just remember who it was made sure
you didn't get thrown on that plane.

12
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:37,921
I call it the "Wizard's Wand."

13
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,798
Captain Singh mentioned there
may be positions available

14
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:41,300
on your anti-meta-human
task force.

15
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,756
- Why do you want to do this?
- Mark Mardon killed my dad.

16
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:48,516
James Jesse, Your Honor,
AKA... the Trickster.

17
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:51,765
You're going to prison
either way, James.

18
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:54,396
You stay away from me and
you stay away from my father.

19
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:57,525
If he finds out that he might have a son
that grew up without knowing him,

20
00:00:57,808 --> 00:00:58,809
It would crush him.

21
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:00,649
Jesse's my daughter
and Zoom has her.

22
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:04,064
You're next.

23
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:34,727
Go ahead, kill me.

24
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:40,234
But my daughter is innocent.

25
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:42,315
Please.

26
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:47,609
Let Jesse live.

27
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:52,162
Go on!

28
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:55,161
Say something!

29
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,088
Merry Christmas.

30
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:13,016
Fathwoom!

31
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,394
I had to fight
some old lady for the last one.

32
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:17,350
They didn't have
any Green Arrow dolls.

33
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:20,857
Don't know why you'd want a toy of that crazy
man. I can't figure out what to get Barry.

34
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:24,111
I was thinking you could give him this.

35
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:25,941
Oh, that's nice.

36
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:28,106
But I kind of want to get him
something more meaningful.

37
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:32,119
I mean, it's been a strange,
emotional 12 months.

38
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,279
Yeah. You don't have to tell me.

39
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:37,074
I know, babe. I miss Eddie, too.

40
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:40,703
How about you get Barry
uh, a really nice watch?

41
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,088
Like Grandpa Ben gave to you.

42
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:44,414
That ain't a bad idea.

43
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:48,548
You know, my dad only gave me
this watch because I was always late.

44
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,303
- You?
- Yeah.

45
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:53,306
He always gave a gift
with a not-so-hidden message,

46
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,592
like this watch,
or the time he bought me free weights

47
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,102
because he said
I was too skinny.

48
00:02:57,928 --> 00:03:01,933
I told him, "When I have a son,
I'm only giving him fun presents."

49
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:05,360
And this thing barely works.
Don't know why I still wear it.

50
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:08,772
Because it's from family.

51
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:13,072
You sure you're all right?

52
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:16,197
Yeah, yeah, I promise.

53
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:23,997
You know, we should really be
more professional.

54
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:26,381
You do realize you initiated that.

55
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,464
Yes, and I'm fully prepared
to reprimand myself then.

56
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:35,433
I'm just saying, you know, anyone
could walk in like, Joe, or Captain...

57
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,801
Yo.

58
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:41,271
- But I... I have, like, a 4:00 to 12:00.
- Yep.

59
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,523
- But I'll call... I'll see you later.
- All right.

60
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,942
- I'll see you at Christmas.
- Yeah. Okay, bye.

61
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:50,773
I'm so happy for you.

62
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:52,315
Truly.

63
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:54,033
Thank you. I...

64
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:56,570
It means a lot to me that you like her.

65
00:03:58,321 --> 00:03:59,789
I don't know, it's...

66
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:01,833
Wells, um...

67
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:05,041
He left me that message where he said

68
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:07,043
that I'd never really be happy.

69
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:10,960
And for a while I really started
to believe him, but now...

70
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:13,504
I don't know. Maybe there is a way that...

71
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,716
Are you okay? What's wrong?

72
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,685
I'm so sorry.
I can't keep this in anymore, Barry.

73
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:21,970
What?

74
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:24,856
I know I was so mad at you and Dad
for not telling me that you were The Flash,

75
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:28,644
But when I found out about this,
I didn't know what to do.

76
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,653
What? What's going on? What's...

77
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:31,859
When Francine came back,

78
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:36,072
my Dad told me not to trust her
and he was right.

79
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:39,572
I didn't know how much.

80
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:46,371
When my mother left us, she was pregnant.

81
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:49,214
She had a son.

82
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:52,835
Joe's son. My brother.

83
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:58,347
What's his name?

84
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:00,675
Wally.

85
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,554
Wally West.

86
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:08,608
When I found out, I told her to leave
and then never come back,

87
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:09,984
and to never tell my dad.

88
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:13,898
But Barry, I feel... I feel like
this is hollowing me out.

89
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:18,069
Every time I look at Dad, I feel like
I'm hurting him. I don't know what to do.

90
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:20,529
I think you know what you have to do.

91
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:22,072
I can't. It's gonna kill him.

92
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:23,661
No, it won't.

93
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:26,748
You don't have to do this alone.
We can tell him together.

94
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:28,461
Thank you.

95
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,667
Yeah.

96
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:37,088
Hey, look. Snow.

97
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:42,017
Maybe it'll be a white Christmas.

98
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,643
That'd be nice.

99
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,651
I was just thinking that if we could
inject an unstable neutrino burst

100
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:53,357
into the individual breaches,

101
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,193
it might cause them
to seal on their own.

102
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,824
And stop Zoom from travelling back
and forth between our worlds.

103
00:05:58,441 --> 00:05:59,784
At least then,
we wouldn't have to worry about him

104
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:02,537
sending any more meta-humans
over for Barry to fight.

105
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:04,323
- It means a lot.
- What does?

106
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:08,539
You looking after Barry. He's been
through a lot the last few weeks.

107
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:12,172
Barry's not the only person here
I want to keep safe.

108
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:16,676
Oh, dear Lord.
Just kiss already. Oh, the thirst is real.

109
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,428
Is everything all right?

110
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:21,682
Yeah, I keep checking, but all
is quiet on the meta-human front.

111
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,933
Hey, you think Zoom
decided to take Christmas off?

112
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:25,469
What's Christmas?

113
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:30,357
Oh, well, it's this holiday we have
where we cut down trees and sing songs

114
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,109
To celebrate the birth of a baby
2,000 years ago,

115
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,612
and then the Romans killed him,
so we give each other gifts.

116
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,022
That's your explanation?

117
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:39,817
- I know what Christmas is.
- Oh, right. Of course.

118
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:44,120
Um, you know, Joe and Barry and Iris
are having people over for Christmas Eve.

119
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,873
And they said we could
invite whoever we want.

120
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:48,579
Who, who do you want?

121
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:52,337
You.
I want to invite you, I mean.

122
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:54,790
This is so painful.
Have you guys seen Harry?

123
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,050
Uh, no, I have not.
I told him to rest.

124
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,631
He's just as stubborn as all the rest
of my male patients in this place.

125
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,594
I'm gonna leave you two alone, okay?
I'm gonna go find Harry.

126
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:05,384
Holy Hannah. Hi.

127
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:06,801
Hi.

128
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,312
- Everything okay?
- Sure.

129
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:11,605
Why wouldn't it be?

130
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,898
Why wouldn't it be?

131
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:26,030
Man, it's really coming down.
The news didn't say anything about snow.

132
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:27,698
Maybe it's a Christmas miracle.

133
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,293
Let it snow.

134
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:41,378
We are...

135
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,303
Knock, knock.

136
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:59,149
So, early parole.

137
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,068
You interested?

138
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:06,202
Don't mean to be a noodge,
but the exit is upstairs.

139
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,033
Just need one more thing.

140
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,251
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

141
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:25,514
It's beginning to look
a lot like Christmas.

142
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,902
Please tell me this is not happening.

143
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,563
It's official, Santa hates us.

144
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:45,234
This sudden blizzard took out
cameras and the security system.

145
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,448
I mean, thank God nobody was killed

146
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,033
but there's no trace
of Mardon, Jesse, or Snart.

147
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,949
Uh, speaking of which,
with Mardon back on the scene...

148
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:56,040
- Yeah?
- Patty might not be thinking so clearly.

149
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:59,210
What do you mean?
What does Mardon have to do with Patty?

150
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:06,429
We should have expected this.

151
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:12,185
The unexpected drop in barometric pressure
had to mean Mardon's back in town.

152
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:14,597
- Patty...
- Jesse was on full communication lockdown

153
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:16,765
but that doesn't mean Mardon
and Snart weren't in contact.

154
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:20,060
Patty, Joe told me about Mardon.

155
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:24,147
I can't talk to you about this.

156
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:25,816
Hey, Patty, it's okay.

157
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:28,359
I got it.

158
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,486
Look, Barry, you're a really sweet guy,

159
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,405
but you have no idea what's
really going on in this city.

160
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,199
I mean, you don't even
know that Harrison Wells...

161
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,170
I'm sorry, I don't have time
to bring you up to speed.

162
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:42,378
That's ironic. Patty, Patty,
look, I care about you a lot.

163
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,759
I don't want to see
you do anything reckless.

164
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:47,888
I'm a cop. Going after
criminals is in my job description.

165
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:49,548
It's not reckless.

166
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:51,967
And powers or not, Mardon's
gonna answer for what he's done.

167
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:54,101
Patty...

168
00:09:56,638 --> 00:10:00,563
Deck the halls with body parts
from a girl named Holly

169
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,734
I don't remember those being the lyrics.

170
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:09,910
Oh, I am tremendously creative.
That, I can tell you.

171
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:11,615
You better be. I didn't break you out,

172
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:14,247
I didn't break either of you out because,
I was looking to make new friends.

173
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:17,501
That is not the holiday spirit,
Marky-Mark.

174
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:20,162
Christmas is a time for togetherness.

175
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:23,423
And what says togetherness
more than mass graves?

176
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:25,467
- Hmm?
- So why did you break us out?

177
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,922
Well, I owed you one.

178
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:31,048
And this guy, he's just crazy.
That's a compliment.

179
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:33,050
And we all want the same thing.

180
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:34,680
Fashion advice?

181
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:36,390
To see The Flash dead.

182
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:38,726
Well, that was more of a
New Years resolution,

183
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,231
but, hey, I'm flexible.

184
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:43,439
That hasn't gone so well
for anyone in this room.

185
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,820
What makes you think
you can stop him this time?

186
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:50,109
Three against one. Plus,
the one isn't quite what he was.

187
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,779
See, another speedster,
dressed all in black,

188
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,038
nearly took him out a few weeks ago.

189
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:58,325
He's vulnerable. He's weak.

190
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:01,290
It's a mistake
to underestimate him.

191
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:06,334
No. With my power, his flair,
and your smarts,

192
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,342
we can put him in the ground for good.

193
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,754
- Tell me your plan.
- Tell me you're in.

194
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,012
I'm thinking about it.

195
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:13,219
What's the matter?

196
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,759
A few months in the clink
make you soft, did it, Snart?

197
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:22,140
- You wanna dance?
- Boys, boys, boys, play nice.

198
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:24,935
Mellow out, Mardon.
Don't have a snit, Snart.

199
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,443
Here's an idea.

200
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:31,279
We all go out, have a few drinks,
kill some carolers. We'll all feel better.

201
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:32,985
All right.

202
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:36,745
So what's it gonna be, Snart?

203
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:44,670
Oh, yeah. Weather Wizard,
Captain Cold, and the Trickster.

204
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,298
There's three of them and one of you.
I do not like those odds.

205
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:50,301
And I'm gonna be no help
without my speed, so...

206
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:53,471
Oh, Oh, light bulb, up here.
I have an idea.

207
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:56,133
Most weather phenomena are marked,
no pun intended,

208
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:59,018
by a change in electric charge
and pressure in the atmosphere.

209
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:01,100
We could just map out
those fluctuations to...

210
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:02,263
To pinpoint his location.

211
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,603
Right, it would just be a matter
of removing all the electricity...

212
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:06,018
From his immediate surroundings.

213
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:07,436
Attracting it to one spot.

214
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:08,945
The same way
a lightning rod does.

215
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:10,650
Only instead of a lightning rod,
we could use...

216
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,110
A wand?

217
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:14,117
Have we already had this conversation?

218
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:16,118
- Kind of.
- What does that mean?

219
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:17,737
Uh...

220
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:20,164
All right.
So the last time Mardon attacked,

221
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:24,453
he, um, generated a tidal wave
that destroyed all of Central City.

222
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,122
So, why are you
not all sleeping with the fishes?

223
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,631
Earth-2 has "The Godfather"?

224
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,292
Every Earth has
"The Godfather," Vito.

225
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:34,471
So, I ran back through time.
One day into the past,

226
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,507
and I got a do over, and I stopped Mardon
before he could hurt anyone.

227
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,392
You shouldn't have
messed with the timeline.

228
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,052
That's what
the other Wells said.

229
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:43,142
So the good news is,
in that timeline,

230
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,853
you created The Wand
and it worked.

231
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,935
- For the first time.
- Yeah. No pressure.

232
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:50,395
I can give you a hand.

233
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:52,689
- Best of both worlds?
- I like that.

234
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:57,614
You good, Harry?

235
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,871
Yeah, why wouldn't I be?

236
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:04,167
Holiday blues? It can't be easy knowing
Zoom still has his daughter.

237
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:08,705
Yeah. All right, look, I'll be right back.
I have something I have to deal with.

238
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,213
Hey.

239
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:21,805
Okay.

240
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:24,517
Okay, the last time the two of
you were looking at me like that,

241
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,102
Was when you both took
my convertible on a joy ride

242
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:29,609
and wrapped it around that
big oak tree on Fairmont Drive.

243
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:31,190
Dad...

244
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:35,399
All right, Joe, we have something
that we need to tell you...

245
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:36,737
No, um...

246
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,741
I have something that I need to tell you.

247
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:44,203
It's about Francine.

248
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:53,758
When she left us,

249
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:56,594
she was pregnant.

250
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:21,574
Did she have the baby?

251
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:23,613
Yes.

252
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:27,500
His name is Wally.

253
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,123
Wally West.

254
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:35,216
It's short for Wallace.

255
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:40,138
That's what we were gonna name you
if you were a boy.

256
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:43,467
I only found out
a couple of weeks ago, Dad.

257
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:46,887
Dad, I am so sorry
that I didn't tell you sooner.

258
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:51,854
That's why she reached out to us
after all of these years.

259
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,984
She wanted us to know before...

260
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:56,901
- She...
- Before she died.

261
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:02,990
And I thought Francine
was running out of surprises.

262
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,331
I gotta get to work.

263
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,163
Dad, listen... Dad.

264
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:12,666
I'm sorry.

265
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,129
Just let me sit with it.

266
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:29,137
Do you think that he's gonna be okay?

267
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:31,305
I do, yeah, I think...

268
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,770
It's just a lot to take in.

269
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,810
He just needs a little time
to process it.

270
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:39,356
Ho-ho-ho.

271
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:50,032
Hmm.

272
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:52,243
Cocoa isn't cocoa without
the mini marshmallows.

273
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,208
And you're out. I checked.

274
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:57,631
Are you out of your mind,
breaking into my home?

275
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:00,418
Careful. Made an upgrade to the cold gun.

276
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,463
If I release my grip from the handle,
the core goes critical.

277
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:07,349
You might make it. She won't.

278
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:16,726
Read your article
on the disappearing middle class.

279
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:18,941
Strong point of view.
Nice prose style.

280
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:20,650
Yeah, well, who needs a Pulitzer

281
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,236
when you have a homicidal
maniac's seal of approval.

282
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,868
Didn't Barry tell you?
I had a rough childhood.

283
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:28,371
Everyone in this room had
a rough childhood. Get over it.

284
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:29,746
Why are you here, Snart?

285
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:32,500
I got the Noel spirit,
wanted to give you a gift.

286
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:35,127
Mardon broke Jesse and me out to kill you.

287
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:37,584
Jesse's on board, of course.
He's shaking with excitement.

288
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,420
Me, I'm gonna pass.

289
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:40,834
Why? You grow a conscience?

290
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,423
Mardon wants revenge.
Jesse wants chaos.

291
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,055
I'm just not invested like they are.

292
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:48,057
You mean there's no money
in it for you?

293
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:50,218
I was never much
for non-profit work.

294
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,386
If you're not in with them,
then tell me where they are.

295
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,772
Nah, consider me more
of a secret Santa.

296
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:58,356
Besides, you and your friends
love to solve a good mystery.

297
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,444
You are full of it, Snart.

298
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:06,530
I think my friends
and I saved your sister's life,

299
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:08,819
and you just can't stand
owing me a marker.

300
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:12,411
I hate to break it to you, but that...
that right there is called honor.

301
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,952
Go on. Make your pitch.
I can see you're dying to.

302
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:17,958
Help me stop them.

303
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:22,171
Sorry. I'm not interested in being a hero.

304
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:26,797
Well, you're doing a pretty lousy job
of being a villain this week.

305
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:29,883
Merry Christmas, Barry.

306
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,436
Hey.

307
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:48,155
I was just thinking about a big drug bust

308
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:50,991
that me and Singh made about 10 years ago.

309
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:55,913
Afterward, we went for a steak lunch,

310
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,498
to treat ourselves for a job well done.

311
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:03,087
And while we were ordering,
I got this feeling in my chest.

312
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:05,251
Like my heart was being squeezed.

313
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:07,837
And I knew something wasn't right.

314
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:09,972
So I called your school

315
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:13,135
and the nurse said to me that
she was just about to call me.

316
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:16,808
Iris was on her way to the hospital.

317
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:18,314
When her appendix burst.

318
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,975
And I knew it.
I could feel it, right here.

319
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:23,440
I knew my kid needed me.

320
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:28,858
So, if I have that feeling as a parent,

321
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,527
why didn't I feel it for my son?

322
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:33,867
Joe, it's not your fault that
you didn't know about him.

323
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:35,623
Yeah, it was.

324
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:41,830
When Francine left rehab that last time,
I should've looked for her.

325
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,839
I'm a cop. I could've found her.

326
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:45,250
Brought her back here.

327
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:46,884
Tried again. Tried harder.

328
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:48,590
You were protecting Iris.

329
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:51,302
I've been telling
myself that for 20 years.

330
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:54,763
A 20-year lie. But I wasn't
protecting her. I was protecting myself.

331
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:57,645
I couldn't stand it anymore.

332
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,054
I couldn't...

333
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:03,985
I hated not being able to help Francine.

334
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,437
So it was easier

335
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:11,284
for her to be dead.
Out of my life. Out of our lives.

336
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:14,783
But it wasn't for Iris.

337
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:17,456
I was being selfish.

338
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:21,119
And that poor boy
paid the price.

339
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,536
Joe.

340
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,293
He never had a father

341
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,503
to read to him at night,
to show him how to throw a football,

342
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:31,592
to make him feel safe.

343
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:34,424
And loved.

344
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:40,347
Who taught him how to be a man, Barry?

345
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:44,601
"Him," I can't even say his name.

346
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,777
What have I done?

347
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,826
Joe, look,

348
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:59,825
you have been there for me
every day since I met you.

349
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:02,292
You have.

350
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:04,412
And...

351
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:09,467
You would've done the exact same thing
for him if you could've. I know it.

352
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,838
I'm sorry.

353
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:19,264
Where's your partner, Spivot?

354
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:21,555
I don't know,
I'm not his babysitter.

355
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:26,146
I'm sorry, sir. I'm not sure where Joe is.

356
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:29,563
Flashy the red-nosed Speedster

357
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:33,483
Had a very shiny suit

358
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:37,199
And if you ever saw him

359
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:41,036
You might even want to puke

360
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:44,873
Merry Christmas, kiddywinks! I'm back.

361
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:47,880
Get TARU down here now.
I wanna know how he's doing this.

362
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:49,381
Citizens,

363
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:54,888
you know, the holidays can be a time
for gentle reflection on the year past,

364
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:58,801
our ups and downs,
our triumphs and heartaches,

365
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:04,848
but don't forget, they can also be a time
for disemboweling our enemies.

366
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:06,766
We don't have a Trickster on Earth-2.

367
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:07,979
He's one of a kind.

368
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:10,565
No, my stocking won't be
completely stuffed

369
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:15,324
until it's filled to the brim
with bloody Flash parts.

370
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:20,956
So what do you say, speed freak?
You want to roast chestnuts?

371
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:25,042
I want all tactical units on high alert.
Get in touch with other precincts.

372
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:27,499
I want watch commanders
coordinating deployment.

373
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:29,459
Spivot, I need you to... Spivot!

374
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:32,292
Are there any clues
as to where he is based on the video?

375
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,550
None that I can see.

376
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:39,549
Guys, there's a reflection
of something in his cornea. See?

377
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:41,934
What is that?

378
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,309
Not sure.

379
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:47,477
That's Mr. Jiggle Wiggle.

380
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,062
- Come again?
- It's a doll.

381
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:52,104
A stuffed children's toy. I gave one to
my daughter when she was six.

382
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:54,738
Mr. Jiggle Wiggle
was manufactured by Okamura Toys.

383
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:57,650
Yahtzee! Okamura once had
a shipping facility in Central City

384
00:21:57,942 --> 00:22:00,036
That shut down four years ago.
It's been abandoned ever since.

385
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:01,867
What if Weather Wizard's there?
The wand's not finished.

386
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,906
Well, the Trickster is.

387
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:21,136
What are you doing here?

388
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:24,051
Same thing as you.
Trying to catch a murderer.

389
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:30,100
We can't let Christmas
hog all the holiday fun.

390
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:32,689
Happy Hanukkah!

391
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:35,108
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel

392
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:37,944
I made you out of C-4!

393
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:43,988
Put that in your pipe and smoke it.

394
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:59,213
I'm afraid we are definitely looking
at closed casket funerals.

395
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:00,925
There's nowhere for me to run us to!

396
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,260
So what should we do?

397
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:04,550
Hold me.

398
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:05,718
I'm seeing someone.

399
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:07,262
Me too. Don't let go.

400
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:23,369
- Detective!
- It was all just a trap for you.

401
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,825
Mardon and Jesse aren't even here.
They're still on the loose.

402
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:27,331
How did you know to come here?

403
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:30,083
Because there was a reflection in
Jesse's eye of Mr. Jiggle Wiggle.

404
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:31,835
And that's the thing that my dad...

405
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,125
It doesn't even matter.

406
00:23:34,288 --> 00:23:35,665
That's why you came here alone

407
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:38,709
without any backup?
Because of your father?

408
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:40,719
You don't know anything about me.

409
00:23:40,878 --> 00:23:43,006
I know that
you're being reckless.

410
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:45,846
And I'm sure the people in you
life care enough about you

411
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:47,601
To not want to see you get hurt.

412
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,104
Except Mardon
didn't kill my father.

413
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:52,014
I did.

414
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:54,979
See, he had a little shoe shop,
and we didn't have any money,

415
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,690
so I worked there after school.
Except, one day,

416
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:00,197
I decided not to show up because...

417
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:03,735
because I was being stupid
and silly with my friends.

418
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:06,324
I didn't even call
to tell him that I was ditching.

419
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:11,209
So he brought
the deposits to the bank, not me.

420
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:16,543
He was shot and killed by Mardon, not me.

421
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:22,462
That's why you became a cop.
Joined the meta-human task force.

422
00:24:22,753 --> 00:24:24,801
It'll be legal when I kill Mardon.

423
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:27,934
I have made my whole life about
getting justice for my father,

424
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:30,015
even if it meant I didn't have a life.

425
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:33,856
And now, I met a really great guy,
and that doesn't even feel real to me.

426
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,892
And I'm scared
he's gonna find out how angry I am.

427
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:40,358
I don't even know
why I'm telling you this.

428
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:43,900
Sometimes it's just easier to say
things to someone with no face.

429
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,618
Thank you for saving me.

430
00:24:46,777 --> 00:24:49,496
You know, even if you get
this guy that wronged you,

431
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:52,078
It doesn't always make things better.

432
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:53,834
It has to be better than this.

433
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:09,387
Patty, it's me again, uh...

434
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:11,476
I'd really love to talk.
I'm worried about you.

435
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:16,228
Anyway, just give me a call
when you get a chance, all right?

436
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,267
Thank you. Bye.

437
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,778
- Barry.
- Yeah?

438
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,564
How's it look?

439
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:25,941
Eerily familiar.

440
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:27,109
How's Patty?

441
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:29,370
She is, um,

442
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,118
hiding a lot of pain behind her smile.

443
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:34,875
They say couples start to resemble
each other after a little while.

444
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:38,246
The thing is, I mean,
she only opened up to Flash, not me.

445
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:40,460
So even if I could got her on the phone,
I don't know what to say.

446
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:42,207
Well,

447
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:45,344
it's been my experience that just
being around you can be a big help.

448
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:46,628
Thank you.

449
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:54,266
Iwant an iPhone, an iPad, and an iTouch.

450
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:57,014
Dial it back, Mr. Greedy.

451
00:25:57,181 --> 00:25:59,934
Those are a little out
of Santa's price range.

452
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,898
How about this?

453
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:06,991
Now remember,
don't open it until tomorrow.

454
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:10,694
It's a surprise.

455
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:27,086
Have you decided?

456
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,345
I need more time.

457
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:32,429
Don't we all. Decide.

458
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:34,059
I need more time.

459
00:26:34,218 --> 00:26:40,851
Maybe if I go up there and kill
a few of your new friends...

460
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:42,726
No.

461
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:44,190
One more day.

462
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:48,024
I'll tell your daughter you said hello.

463
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,285
What's that? Is that Mardon?

464
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:01,499
That's definitely him.

465
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:03,505
Atmospheric pressure
just dropped 200 hectopascals.

466
00:27:03,664 --> 00:27:05,132
- Where?
- Central City Square.

467
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,337
The tree lighting ceremony.

468
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,877
There's thousands
of people there.

469
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:24,814
Oh, glad to see you.
Maybe you can help me.

470
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:27,480
Help get back into a jail cell?
That'll be my pleasure, Mardon.

471
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:29,398
No. No. See, I'm trying to decide

472
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:32,785
if I should kill everybody down
there with a deadly hail storm or,

473
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:35,662
a little trickier, with acid rain.
What do you think?

474
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,284
Uh, let me think. How about neither?

475
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:41,577
You see this wand here? Guess what?

476
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:48,425
Um, guys? He's flying.

477
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,336
He can fly?
Since when can he fly?

478
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:53,381
Well, he's using his
powers to alter the air pressure

479
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,515
To create pockets of updraft that can...

480
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,267
No, he can fly.

481
00:27:57,426 --> 00:27:58,427
Barry, get him!

482
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:33,175
You didn't really think I'd let you hurt
all these people, did you?

483
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:35,055
No, of course not.

484
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:38,092
But I bet you're gonna let me hurt you.

485
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:43,681
Feliz Navidad!

486
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:47,021
Time for a real war on Christmas.

487
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:50,609
- What is this?
- That is a box with a bomb in it.

488
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:54,821
Yep. I've handed out
about 100 of them today.

489
00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:58,370
Oh, it feels so good to give.

490
00:28:58,654 --> 00:29:00,156
You see, right now,

491
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:02,620
there are 100 random children.

492
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:05,627
They've each taken home a box,
just like that one,

493
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:08,039
and are shoving it
under their Christmas tree.

494
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:11,007
There's no way for you
to get to all of them,

495
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,588
even if you knew where to look.

496
00:29:13,377 --> 00:29:16,051
No, no. Please don't do this.

497
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:18,887
What, me? Kill 100 families? No.

498
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:22,556
That's up to you.
I'm happy just to take your life.

499
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:24,846
So, this is how it's gonna be.

500
00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:29,360
You are gonna stand there
and let me end you.

501
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:33,238
Very publicly, and very painfully.

502
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:35,820
And I'll let everybody live.

503
00:29:35,983 --> 00:29:37,530
But,

504
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:41,830
if I see even a little flicker
of electricity on you...

505
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:47,916
the casket makers in this town
are gonna have a very merry Christmas.

506
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:50,005
So, Flash,

507
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:52,048
what's it gonna be?

508
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,042
Huh?

509
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:02,972
There you go.

510
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:12,190
They're gonna kill Barry!

511
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:14,025
Unless we find those bombs.

512
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:15,905
- Jay, there's no way.
- There is a way.

513
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,907
To find 100
randomly-placed bombs?

514
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:19,739
We don't have to find 100.

515
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:23,200
We just have to find one,
and then we get rid of them all.

516
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,535
- How?
- A breach.

517
00:30:24,698 --> 00:30:27,076
That's right. We sent Grodd away.
We can do the same to these bombs,

518
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:28,914
all of them.
Do you have a drone in your workshop?

519
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:30,124
- Yeah.
- Does it fly?

520
00:30:30,287 --> 00:30:32,415
Good. I'm taking it.
You're not getting it back.

521
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:34,083
You're not getting it back.

522
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:35,341
I'll warm up the van.

523
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:53,477
I'm cross-referencing
credit card statements

524
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:55,441
with toll road usage and families
with children under ten.

525
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:58,107
Hold up. Make a U-turn. Two streets back.

526
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:08,792
Your toys, give them to me.

527
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:11,044
Mom!

528
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:13,880
Oh, Flash, you all right?

529
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:15,795
You don't look so good.

530
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:19,462
I know. I'll give you a jolt.

531
00:31:26,343 --> 00:31:27,765
Oh!

532
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:33,309
Harry, what is the plan?

533
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:35,819
One of the 52 breaches opened
by the singularity

534
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:37,729
is a quarter mile directly above the city.

535
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:43,699
And we are gonna use your drone
to put this bomb into that breach.

536
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:45,908
Okay, how does that work?
One down, 99 to blow.

537
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:47,948
Basic physics, Ramon. Magnetism.

538
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:53,246
Magnetism. Magnets of opposite poles
attract one another. Help me out, Garrick.

539
00:31:53,537 --> 00:31:55,665
If we can change
the dimensional frequency of this bomb

540
00:31:55,831 --> 00:31:56,832
and get it through that breach...

541
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:59,171
it'll drag all the rest of the bombs
right along with it. I'll drive.

542
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:01,132
Okay, hold on.

543
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:09,936
Ah! I'm done. He's all yours.

544
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,514
Oh! God!

545
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:20,022
To think this city worships you!

546
00:32:21,982 --> 00:32:25,862
But when I kill The Flash,

547
00:32:26,153 --> 00:32:29,532
they'll realize
I'm the man who saved Central City!

548
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:46,548
It's working!

549
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:48,930
Was that you?

550
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:50,093
No! Gut him!

551
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,183
All right, I'm gutting already.

552
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:54,723
Barry, the bombs are gone!

553
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:58,226
Uh-oh.

554
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:14,584
How you like the magnets, bitch?

555
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,336
Detective, it's taken care of.
They can't hurt anyone else.

556
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:31,343
What are you doing?

557
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:33,269
What are you doing?

558
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:34,600
This is for my father.

559
00:33:35,764 --> 00:33:37,437
No, no, no, Detective!

560
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:45,236
Detective, no! You can't do this!

561
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:47,821
He killed my father
for a couple hundred dollars.

562
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:50,908
What was so important
that my father had to lose his life?

563
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:52,869
Mardon will get what he deserves.

564
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,033
- He deserves to die!
- Not like this!

565
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:57,748
You don't have it in you, pretty lady.

566
00:33:57,911 --> 00:34:01,211
I've been asking myself that for
the last four years, and now I know

567
00:34:01,498 --> 00:34:02,966
No. Patty!

568
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:05,135
You pull that trigger,

569
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:08,046
your life ends too.
You will go to prison.

570
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:11,842
Everything and everyone
that you could have had in your life

571
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,976
will be taken from you. Again.

572
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:19,141
Mardon can't take anything else from you
unless you let him.

573
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:24,692
I didn't know your father,
but I know he wouldn't want this.

574
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,823
Not over him.

575
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:31,828
Please. Please.

576
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,577
Mark Mardon, you're under arrest.

577
00:34:38,952 --> 00:34:40,499
That was beautiful.

578
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,676
- Barr, hey.
- Hey.

579
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:54,184
Everyone's heading over to our
place for Christmas. You okay?

580
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:57,346
Yeah. No. Nothing a little meta-human

581
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,685
regenerative healing
capabilities won't cure.

582
00:34:59,973 --> 00:35:02,396
How did it go with Francine?

583
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:04,527
It was good.
It was really good, actually.

584
00:35:05,395 --> 00:35:09,525
I mean, I spent so long
lying about her being dead

585
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:11,652
that I started to believe it myself.

586
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:14,071
But the truth is, those feelings
were always there.

587
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:16,865
That anger, that regret,
the guilt...

588
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,494
I just didn't realize
how much I needed to forgive her.

589
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:25,670
And now, there's room for another West.

590
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:27,500
Did you meet him?

591
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:29,590
No. He still doesn't know.

592
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,714
- That'll come.
- Wow.

593
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:35,175
- You have a son.
- I know, right?

594
00:35:35,342 --> 00:35:36,468
It's crazy.

595
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:38,433
Speaking of which, take this.

596
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:40,230
What?

597
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:42,061
No, no, no, no,
I can't take that.

598
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:44,442
I've always said

599
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:47,646
that one day, I would give this to my son.

600
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:56,867
And now I have.

601
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,453
Merry Christmas.

602
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:03,499
Merry Christmas. Thank you.

603
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:07,669
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

604
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,254
- See you at the house.
- Yeah.

605
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:25,767
I know that you're not him,

606
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,489
but he's not here
and I have to say this, for me.

607
00:36:31,648 --> 00:36:33,070
In that video message,

608
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:36,115
You said that,

609
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:41,537
that I would never really be happy.

610
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,544
And I've been trying.
I've been trying really hard.

611
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:53,261
After what Joe said,

612
00:36:54,129 --> 00:36:55,722
helping Patty.

613
00:36:56,506 --> 00:36:59,760
I realize that you are still in my heart.

614
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:04,146
How much I hate you

615
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,318
for what you've done.

616
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:14,574
I don't want to hate you anymore. I can't.

617
00:37:16,526 --> 00:37:18,620
I can't hate you anymore.

618
00:37:22,115 --> 00:37:23,458
I forgive you.

619
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,377
You need me for something?

620
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:36,137
No, no, I'm good.

621
00:37:37,547 --> 00:37:42,098
You know, you should, uh,
come over for Christmas tonight.

622
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:43,978
You shouldn't be alone.

623
00:37:45,472 --> 00:37:46,644
It's a nice offer.

624
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,398
I can't celebrate without my daughter.

625
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:52,816
All right.

626
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,661
- Strong enough?
- We'll see.

627
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,295
Huh.

628
00:38:10,747 --> 00:38:12,215
- Yeah.
- I'll be right back.

629
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:13,958
Hey.

630
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,217
What do you have there?

631
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:16,669
Mistletoe.

632
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:17,837
What's mistletoe?

633
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:22,597
Oh, uh, it's a hemi-parasitic plant
from the genus Santalaceae family,

634
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:23,885
in North America, I think.

635
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:26,931
Caitlin, I'm kidding.
We have mistletoe on Earth-2.

636
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:28,269
Right. Of course.

637
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:32,978
Urn, we also have
this tradition over there.

638
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:39,950
We have that tradition here, too.

639
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:41,323
Aw!

640
00:38:41,611 --> 00:38:43,705
- Finally.
- Oh, let me get that.

641
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:44,989
- Eggnog, please?
- Yeah.

642
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,624
Hi, I'm so glad
you could make it.

643
00:38:46,783 --> 00:38:48,035
Aw, thank you for having me.

644
00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:49,418
Merry Christmas.
This is for you.

645
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:50,749
- Thank you.
- Of course.

646
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:53,040
- Hey.
- Hi.

647
00:38:53,206 --> 00:38:55,083
I've been really worried
about you. I've been calling.

648
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:57,594
I know... and I'm really sorry.

649
00:38:57,752 --> 00:39:01,552
I just have been dealing
with something by myself,

650
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:05,470
But I want to tell you about it.
I think that I'm ready to.

651
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,728
Someone reminded me of what's important,

652
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:11,141
so if you want to hear, I
would like to share it with you.

653
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:12,775
That would be the best gift I could get.

654
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:13,981
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

655
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:16,862
I don't know.
This is a really sweet sweater.

656
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:18,864
I hope it's as sweet as this one.

657
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,115
It's matching.

658
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,322
- Thank you.
- Of course.

659
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:24,579
- Detective Spivot.
- Hi!

660
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:25,863
What brings you here?

661
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,577
Merry Christmas.

662
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:32,086
Well, uh, I'm...
Barry's girlfriend.

663
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,623
- About time.
- Cheers.

664
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,175
- Are we expecting anybody else?
- Not that I know of.

665
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:40,007
Maybe Harry changed his mind.

666
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:50,514
Hi. I'm Wally. I'm Francine's son.

667
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:59,655
I'm Joe.

668
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:03,326
This is Iris.

669
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:06,241
- Hi.
- Hi.

670
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:10,666
I just wanted to...

671
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:14,829
I don't know.

672
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:17,624
I guess now's a bad time.
You've got company, so...

673
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:20,168
No. No, no, no. Come in.

674
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:42,403
Time's up, Wells. What's it going to be?

675
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:45,197
I know what you're doing.

676
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:51,579
I know why you keep sending villain
after villain from our Earth to this one.

677
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:58,624
You want Barry to get faster.
You want him to get stronger.

678
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:05,430
You want him to become more powerful,
more full of Speed Force.

679
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,766
You're fattening him up
like a Christmas goose.

680
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:17,560
The more power he has,
the more I can take.

681
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:20,569
And you're going to help me.

682
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,399
Let me see her first.

683
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,078
Daddy?

684
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:36,502
Are you okay? Did he hurt you?

685
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:38,914
Please help me.
Don't let him take me back there.

686
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,423
I won't.

687
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,964
Now decide.

688
00:41:44,127 --> 00:41:48,098
In return
for your daughter's life...

689
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:51,100
I'll do it.

690
00:41:54,554 --> 00:41:57,433
I will help you steal The Flash's speed.
