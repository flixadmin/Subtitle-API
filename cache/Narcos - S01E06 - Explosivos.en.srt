00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:29,793
won't exactly endear us to the voters.

159
00:13:30,502 --> 00:13:35,757
And to be honest...
we don't know how to respond to that one.

160
00:13:35,966 --> 00:13:39,345
Somebody offered me a brand new Caddy,
I'd say thank you.

161
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:43,432
Well, thank you.

162
00:13:43,515 --> 00:13:44,516
And this?

163
00:13:47,102 --> 00:13:49,271
What are we supposed to do with this?

164
00:13:51,106 --> 00:13:52,733
Bullet-proof pants.

165
00:13:53,984 --> 00:13:55,986
I suggest that you wear them.

166
00:13:58,113 --> 00:14:01,325
Thank you, Agent Murphy,
for your consideration.

167
00:14:01,409 --> 00:14:03,827
And we'll keep in mind your advice.

168
00:14:06,121 --> 00:14:07,373
Thank you for your time.

169
00:14:11,543 --> 00:14:13,421
WITH GAVIRIA
THERE WILL BE A FUTURE

170
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,923
[Steve] <i>César Gaviria was riding
a wave of public support</i>

171
00:14:16,131 --> 00:14:18,967
<i>for his stance on extradition.
This made him a target.</i>

172
00:14:20,928 --> 00:14:24,723
<i>But we had a target of our own:
José Rodríguez Gacha,</i>

173
00:14:24,806 --> 00:14:28,352
<i>who we tracked to Cartagena
through one of our informants.</i>

174
00:14:34,691 --> 00:14:38,028
[Gacha in Spanish] Have you heard
of this thing called a computer?

175
00:14:38,904 --> 00:14:42,491
Some guy was trying to sell me a computer.
I don't know what it is.

176
00:14:42,574 --> 00:14:47,955
[boy] It's a new kind of technology
that's coming out.

177
00:14:48,914 --> 00:14:51,208
- It's coming out now?
- Yeah, Dad.

178
00:14:53,461 --> 00:14:55,545
Hey, honey.

179
00:14:57,672 --> 00:15:00,717
You look very beautiful today.

180
00:15:03,137 --> 00:15:07,433
Relax, baby. Relax.
We don't bite. [chuckles]

181
00:15:09,101 --> 00:15:12,438
- Do you need anything else?
- I want you.

182
00:15:13,397 --> 00:15:16,150
- [Gacha] Nothing more, thank you.
- Yes, sir.

183
00:15:19,027 --> 00:15:20,988
I want to fuck her.

184
00:15:21,196 --> 00:15:25,117
We have more important things
to worry about right now, my son.

185
00:15:25,326 --> 00:15:26,868
Understood?

186
00:15:28,036 --> 00:15:30,498
Talk to me. What do you know?

187
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:33,459
Don Gonzalo,
we have people all over the property.

188
00:15:33,542 --> 00:15:34,876
It's secure.

189
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:38,672
- We've got a few men in town as well.
- [grunts]

190
00:15:38,755 --> 00:15:42,926
Now, what can you tell me
about Medellín?

191
00:15:44,386 --> 00:15:46,263
The same, boss.

192
00:15:46,347 --> 00:15:50,434
Carrillo's entire Search Bloc
is out looking for Pablo.

193
00:15:50,518 --> 00:15:51,893
[Gacha] Thank you, Navegante.

194
00:15:52,102 --> 00:15:55,022
- Here to serve, boss.
- Keep us safe.

195
00:15:57,566 --> 00:15:58,817
Don Freddy.

196
00:16:01,945 --> 00:16:04,823
Son... a question.

197
00:16:06,158 --> 00:16:09,161
Are we sheep or are we wolves?

198
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:13,623
- We're wolves.
- We're wolves! Right.

199
00:16:13,707 --> 00:16:15,209
I like it.

200
00:16:17,627 --> 00:16:21,590
[Navegante in Spanish] They're in
a house outside of Cartagena, right here.

201
00:16:21,673 --> 00:16:25,469
Just know there are
a lot of people guarding him.

202
00:16:25,677 --> 00:16:30,682
Navegante, you've been
working for Gacha for many years.

203
00:16:30,765 --> 00:16:34,686
I'm sure in that time you've
earned way more than we are giving you.

204
00:16:35,604 --> 00:16:38,148
So tell me,
why do you want to betray him?

205
00:16:41,776 --> 00:16:43,778
That fucker's crazy.

206
00:16:45,322 --> 00:16:47,408
He's gonna get us all killed.

207
00:16:57,626 --> 00:16:59,961
I don't believe him one bit.

208
00:17:00,045 --> 00:17:02,756
What do you care
why he's doing it?

209
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:07,969
Because we have 23 agents with
outdated weapons waiting in Barranquilla.

210
00:17:08,053 --> 00:17:12,224
And he has twice as many men
with brand new weapons.

211
00:17:12,307 --> 00:17:14,017
And frankly...

212
00:17:14,101 --> 00:17:18,522
I'm tired of sending young men
to face certain death.

213
00:17:18,606 --> 00:17:20,732
So then we have to be smart.

214
00:17:22,901 --> 00:17:24,903
We have to create a trap.

215
00:17:24,986 --> 00:17:27,573
If we catch him alive,
he'll give us Escobar.

216
00:17:27,656 --> 00:17:29,157
And the Ochoas.

217
00:17:29,241 --> 00:17:32,994
- The entire cartel.
- I don't give a fuck, Javier.

218
00:17:33,078 --> 00:17:34,413
I want him dead.

219
00:17:34,496 --> 00:17:36,624
He doesn't care about death.

220
00:17:36,706 --> 00:17:39,793
He only fears rotting in jail.

221
00:17:41,211 --> 00:17:45,090
- That's the real victory.
- Right, I forgot you're a gringo.

222
00:17:46,174 --> 00:17:50,011
- What's that supposed to mean?
- What are you risking?

223
00:17:50,095 --> 00:17:51,888
These aren't your men.

224
00:17:51,972 --> 00:17:54,308
You have no family here to lose.

225
00:17:54,391 --> 00:17:56,893
If this goes badly, there will be
more widows and orphans,

226
00:17:57,102 --> 00:18:00,147
and I'll have to carry that
on my shoulders.

227
00:18:03,358 --> 00:18:05,235
Well...

228
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:07,904
I trust his information.

229
00:18:10,991 --> 00:18:12,951
And I trust you.

230
00:18:13,785 --> 00:18:18,748
But if this turns out bad...
it'll be on your conscience.

231
00:18:26,173 --> 00:18:28,091
[in English] What do we got?

232
00:18:28,175 --> 00:18:32,012
Routine airport surveillance.
We tagged Poison.

233
00:18:42,523 --> 00:18:44,650
Who's this guy?

234
00:18:44,733 --> 00:18:47,110
I don't know, but if Poison
showed his face to pick him up,

235
00:18:47,194 --> 00:18:48,820
he must be really important.

236
00:18:51,615 --> 00:18:53,659
[Gustavo in Spanish]
Here's your payment, sir.

237
00:18:55,785 --> 00:18:59,414
It'll be taken to the coast of Spain
on a cargo ship.

238
00:18:59,498 --> 00:19:02,959
From there, our trucks
will take it to the Basque country.

239
00:19:04,419 --> 00:19:05,962
It's all set up.

240
00:19:08,716 --> 00:19:12,052
5,000 kilos or I go back to Spain
on the first flight.

241
00:19:16,515 --> 00:19:17,974
[Gustavo] What's that?

242
00:19:20,101 --> 00:19:22,229
As far as I know, you and my cousin
have an agreement.

243
00:19:22,437 --> 00:19:24,648
The agreement is for this amount.

244
00:19:24,732 --> 00:19:26,358
What kind of bullshit is this?

245
00:19:27,651 --> 00:19:29,986
5,000 kilos or no deal.

246
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:35,367
Then there is no deal. Who the fuck
do you think you're talking to?

247
00:19:40,247 --> 00:19:42,499
Forgive my cousin, sir.

248
00:19:47,921 --> 00:19:50,507
5,000 it is, then.

249
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:00,434
[Ana] We shouldn't go.

250
00:20:01,727 --> 00:20:03,937
I want you in the US.

251
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,940
You'll be safe there,
far from all of this.

252
00:20:07,023 --> 00:20:09,943
- What if something happens...
- Nothing is going to happen to me.

253
00:20:11,111 --> 00:20:12,571
Let's go.

254
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:27,168
Please, protect him.

255
00:20:28,044 --> 00:20:31,214
Don't worry, everything will be fine.
Come on, I'll walk you.

<i>and my partner was in Cartagena.</i>

<i>He had his own mission,

<i>who had seen their friends and relatives
die at the hands of Gacha.</i>

264
00:21:10,295 --> 00:21:14,466
<i>Like Trujillo,
whose father and two brothers, all cops,</i>

- [in Spanish] Hello, Suárez.
- Look who's here.

00:21:41,409 --> 00:21:43,119
The Golden Gringo.

You don't call, you don't write.

What's going on?

291
00:22:43,054 --> 00:22:44,806
I have reason to believe
the Medellín cartel

292
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:47,100
is planning an imminent attack
against Gaviria.

293
00:22:47,308 --> 00:22:48,518
We have no intel to that effect.

294
00:22:48,602 --> 00:22:52,397
Maybe you should do your job instead
of spying on other agency personnel.

295
00:22:53,273 --> 00:22:56,860
- What's he talking about?
- Nothing, Ambassador.

296
00:22:56,944 --> 00:22:59,112
CIA's been so kind
to give us these documents,

297
00:22:59,195 --> 00:23:02,532
but 90 percent of them
are too classified for us to read.

298
00:23:02,741 --> 00:23:04,910
I need to get into the White Room.

What's that?

00:23:06,703 --> 00:23:08,413
Cut the shit.
You're gonna give me these files.

[chuckling]
You've been reading too many spy novels.

Have you read <i>The Spaniard?</i>

Where the hell did you get that?

304
00:23:19,257 --> 00:23:21,092
Ma'am, he has been in the country
for several days.

305
00:23:21,175 --> 00:23:24,012
He's been escorted
by one of Pablo's top <i>sicarios.</i>

00:23:24,095 --> 00:23:25,096
Let me see this.

307
00:23:25,931 --> 00:23:28,850
[Steve]
I know the CIA has intel on this man.

308
00:23:31,185 --> 00:23:34,397
Now, are you going
to give me access or not?

309
00:23:38,693 --> 00:23:40,862
Technically, the room isn't white.

310

[knocking]

470
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:06,446
Hey, Jaime.

471
00:34:06,529 --> 00:34:08,114
- Don Pablo.
- This is your house?

472
00:34:08,197 --> 00:34:11,200
- Your family?
- Yes, sir. Welcome.

473
00:34:11,284 --> 00:34:12,577
Tell me about them.

474
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:15,288
This is my daughter Marcela.

475
00:34:15,371 --> 00:34:17,665
- Look at what a cute baby.
- [chuckles]

476
00:34:17,748 --> 00:34:20,460
- How proud you must be.
- Of course I am.

477
00:34:20,543 --> 00:34:22,462
Of course.

478
00:34:22,545 --> 00:34:26,924
Very soon, they will have the money
to buy everything they want, Jaime.

479
00:34:27,007 --> 00:34:28,551
Thanks a lot, boss.

480
00:34:28,635 --> 00:34:30,553
- May I please have a glass of water?
- Of course.

481
00:34:30,637 --> 00:34:32,138
Thank you.

482
00:34:32,221 --> 00:34:33,389
- What about you?
- Good, sir.

483
00:34:33,473 --> 00:34:36,476
- How have you been?
- Good, thank you.

484
00:34:37,393 --> 00:34:38,478
Guys.

485
00:34:39,312 --> 00:34:41,814
All right, Jaime.

486
00:34:43,149 --> 00:34:46,235
This is for you to wear
during your mission.

487
00:34:46,319 --> 00:34:47,903
Thank you, Ma'am.
Very kind.

488
00:34:47,987 --> 00:34:49,947
Seriously, Pablo?

489
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:51,740
Thank you very much.

490
00:34:51,824 --> 00:34:53,909
Everything is so beautiful.

491
00:34:53,993 --> 00:34:58,706
You have to be very careful,
and get by unnoticed.

492
00:34:58,789 --> 00:35:02,001
For sure, sir.
I'm ready to do what you're asking.

493
00:35:02,209 --> 00:35:04,211
All right, then, son.

494
00:35:04,295 --> 00:35:05,754
Sit down.

495
00:35:07,798 --> 00:35:12,052
These guys are going to give you
very specific instructions.

496
00:35:12,136 --> 00:35:15,181
Tomorrow morning, you're boarding
the plane that is leaving for Cali.

497
00:35:15,389 --> 00:35:18,392
We want you to record a conversation.

498
00:35:18,476 --> 00:35:21,228
It's very simple,
nothing to worry about.

499
00:35:22,355 --> 00:35:24,190
All right.

500
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:31,489
- How are you feeling?
- I'm... I'm very happy.

501
00:35:31,572 --> 00:35:35,409
Thank you very much for the opportunity,
Don Pablo. Seriously. And for the clothes.

502
00:35:35,493 --> 00:35:38,245
Really, for me,
it's an honor to work for you.

503
00:35:38,329 --> 00:35:39,997
Thank you very much.

504
00:35:41,207 --> 00:35:42,875
[softly] Don't mention it.

505
00:35:44,544 --> 00:35:46,003
OK.

506
00:35:46,086 --> 00:35:48,631
Come here, give me a hug.

507
00:35:50,216 --> 00:35:52,092
Thank you, Don Pablo.

508
00:35:53,469 --> 00:35:55,012
Thank you.

509
00:35:56,013 --> 00:35:58,182
- Ma'am, have a good night.
- [woman] Take care.

510
00:35:58,265 --> 00:35:59,892
Thank you very much.

511
00:35:59,975 --> 00:36:01,644
See you later, boys.

512
00:36:01,728 --> 00:36:03,937
- Take care.
- Yes, sir.

513
00:36:04,021 --> 00:36:06,482
My love, look!

514
00:36:06,566 --> 00:36:10,944
- Look at this jacket. Beautiful, right?
- It's beautiful. What did Pablo say?

515
00:36:11,028 --> 00:36:14,532
You know what?
We're going to get ahead.

516
00:36:15,908 --> 00:36:19,620
You, me and the baby
are going to get ahead.

517
00:36:19,704 --> 00:36:21,038
Thank you, my love.

518
00:36:21,121 --> 00:36:23,791
- Look at this.
- Let's go try it on.

519
00:36:27,253 --> 00:36:29,880
[in Spanish]
I have some news about Gaviria.

520
00:36:29,963 --> 00:36:32,717
They're going to kill him
on the way to Cali.

521
00:36:32,925 --> 00:36:37,012
[in English] Did you say Cali?
Hey, can I get a translate in here?

522
00:36:37,096 --> 00:36:38,723
Suárez, OK.

523
00:36:38,806 --> 00:36:40,099
I can translate.

he could be taken alive.</i>

538

[in Spanish] It was her fault, Dad.

539
00:37:49,627 --> 00:37:53,046
Are you still thinking about that?
Let it go, son.

540
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:57,092
All she had to do was say yes
and I wouldn't have had to shoot her!

00:44:45,042 --> 00:44:47,711
- [in English] Agent Murphy.
- What are you doing here?

627
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:51,673
- [panting] No, no. He can't go, no.
- What?

628
00:44:51,757 --> 00:44:56,386
There's gonna be a bomb waiting.
He goes, he dies.

629
00:44:56,469 --> 00:44:58,430
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you talking about?

630
00:44:58,638 --> 00:45:03,393
This is your job, your call.
But I know something's gonna go down.

631
00:45:03,476 --> 00:45:05,062
Do you have proof?

632
00:45:06,105 --> 00:45:08,815
- I got my gut.
- [scoffs]

633
00:45:08,899 --> 00:45:10,567
You got your gut.

634
00:45:13,361 --> 00:45:16,740
- What if you're wrong?
- I hope to God I am.

635
00:45:16,949 --> 00:45:18,909
What if I'm right?

636
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:28,501
[in Spanish] You nervous?

637
00:45:28,585 --> 00:45:30,963
[Jaime] A little bit, but I'm fine.

638
00:45:31,046 --> 00:45:32,923
[softly] Wait here, wait here.

639
00:45:33,006 --> 00:45:35,134
You know what you have to do?

640
00:45:35,217 --> 00:45:37,010
Yes, sir.

641
00:45:40,513 --> 00:45:44,310
Remember, you have to record
the entire conversation. Don't forget.

642
00:45:44,517 --> 00:45:47,980
- No, sir.
- Have a nice flight.

643
00:45:48,063 --> 00:45:49,982
Aren't you coming with me?

644
00:45:50,065 --> 00:45:55,195
No, the boss just told me
to bring you here.

645
00:45:55,279 --> 00:45:57,405
Hey, but don't worry.

646
00:45:57,489 --> 00:46:00,117
Tomorrow,
I'll come and meet you there.

647
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:04,330
- All right, then.
- All right. Don't be nervous.

648
00:46:04,412 --> 00:46:06,248
You'll see how fun it is to fly.

649
00:46:07,333 --> 00:46:08,792
All right?

650
00:46:09,626 --> 00:46:12,338
Go on. The line is right there.

651
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:14,298
Good luck, then.

652
00:46:22,639 --> 00:46:24,766
[in Spanish] It's up to you, Eduardo.

653
00:46:24,850 --> 00:46:27,519
Whatever you decide, I'll do.

[in Spanish] I'll organize the exit.
You guys stay with him.

658

[in English] Well... it seems like
you and I are not the only ones afraid.
