1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,151
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,277
For 7 years, I have
fought with only one goal--

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,829
to save my city,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,479
but now a new
threat has emerged,

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,154
a danger so severe,
it has forced me

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,112
to leave my family
in order to face it,

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,630
and it won't be enough for
me to just be the Green Arrow.

8
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,313
To prevent the
crisis that's coming,

9
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,471
I'am going to have to
become someone else.

10
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,995
1am going to have to
become...something else.

11
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,632
Previously on "Arrow"...
Earth-2 is...gone.

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,199
The destruction
of that Earth was

13
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,839
a necessary sacrifice.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,072
Mar Novu is not trying to
prevent what's going to happen

15
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,833
because he's gonna
be what causes it.

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,514
John Diggle is
my adoptive father.

17
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,711
-Thanks, Mr. Diggles.
«Call me Dig.

18
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,269
We have to take
out the Deathstrokes.

19
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,355
Zoe!

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,990
Dad?

21
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,510
Dad?

22
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,479
Oh, my God. Dad!

23
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,994
W-William? William?

24
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,479
Hey.

25
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,110
Mia.

26
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,790
Mia?

27
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,670
Dad!

28
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,675
Well, you're $0 young.

29
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,310
Dad?

30
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,560
What is this? How
did they get here?

31
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,233
I-- don't know.

32
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,389
Those are my kids.

33
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,509
Your kids.

34
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,954
Are you--are you okay?

35
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,912
H-how is this real?

36
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,236
Good question. The
last time I checked,

37
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,119
you didn't have an adult
daughter or any daughter.

38
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,679
We had a daughter...

39
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,430
and we named her Mia.

40
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,113
Felicity gave birth a few
months after we left Star City.

41
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,679
How? I-I didn't even
know she was pregnant.

42
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,189
We didn't tell anyone.

43
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,357
We wanted to
keep her off the grid

44
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,834
to protect her.

45
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,954
That was only a few months ago.

46
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,479
This is Novu.

47
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,029
You called me Dad.

48
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,395
You adopted me.

49
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,798
Remember? It's Connor.

50
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,272
No. No. I--I-- I haven't.

51
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,750
He hasn't because he hasn't yet.

52
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,790
Look. What are
you talking about?

53
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,755
I think we're in the past.

54
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,676
-That is insane.
-Look at this place.

55
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,111
It's new, and them!

56
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,719
No gray hair, no wrinkles,

57
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,316
and we are staring
at our dad alive

58
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,273
instead of at his tombstone.

59
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,829
I'm sorry. What year is this?

60
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,590
2-2--uh, it's 2019.

61
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,314
What year is it supposed to be?

62
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,395
2040.

63
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,073
Wait. So an hour ago, I was just
with Ben Turner's 6-year-old child,

64
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,799
and now he's an adult,
and I'm his father?

65
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,277
At least you didn't throw
up like you usually do.

66
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,430
Just saying.

67
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,950
I'm genuinely sorry
that both of you

68
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,155
found out this way,

69
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,913
about Mia, about
the Monitor. I'm...

70
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,479
Felicity and I
wanted to tell you.

71
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,070
Oliver, as far as excuses go,

72
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,914
a cosmic being asking
you to sacrifice your life

73
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,277
to save the entire universe
is a...pretty good one.

74
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,432
Look. Those kids have 20
years of stuff we don't know.

75
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,911
When are we gonna be able
to ask them what happens?

76
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,434
I think we should
give them their space,

77
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,478
and when they're
ready, they'll open up.

78
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,792
Okay. Laurel's on
her way to Star City.

79
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,835
I can't believe her
entire Earth is just gone.

80
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,476
I don't understand. Why didn't
the Monitor bring her here?

81
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,074
Or grown-up ♪ or Zoe?

82
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,390
What game is he playing?

83
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,550
I don't know,

84
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,510
but we have to stop him.

85
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,790
How do we stop agod?

86
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,192
I'm working on it.

87
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,273
Okay. How did this
happen? This can't be real.

88
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,078
Well, it is.

89
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,358
Hey. Are you okay?

90
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,433
I'm fine. Yeah.
Just please tell me

91
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,597
that you were able to get JJ.

92
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,914
I had him, and I
was gonna... kill him,

93
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,078
and the next thing I
know, I'm=I'm here.

94
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,034
So he's still out there.

95
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,271
You mean, out there
20 years in the future

96
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,914
unless you're talking
about the current JJ,

97
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,275
who'd be, like, what, 5?

98
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,999
And you're not gonna thwick him.

99
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,915
Mia?

100
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,718
No, I'm not, okay?

101
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,514
How does this even work?

102
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,591
All right, ‘cause my dad
doesn't even know who I am,

103
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,917
and if he finds out
about JJ, what he did,

104
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,117
what I-what I almost did,

105
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,550
he won't want to.

106
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,434
So don't tell him.

107
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,991
Don't tell anyone anything.

108
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,515
-Are you serious?
-She's right.

109
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,478
This is original Team
Arrow we're talking about.

110
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,789
They are gonna
know something's up.

111
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,678
Do you want to tell
Rene his daughter's dead

112
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,117
or tell John that his
son's the one who did it?

113
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,034
What's done is done.

114
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,119
Wow. This place
looks exactly like it did

115
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,350
when I was 13,

116
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,318
which makes sense
because I guess I still am.

117
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,115
Sorry about the boxes.

118
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,157
Felicity and I left
pretty suddenly

119
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,879
to get to the cabin,

120
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,758
and we had planned to

121
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,639
come back here with
both of you at some point.

122
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,111
Yeah. That, um,
didn't really work out.

123
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,110
Because I died?

124
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,558
We don't know exactly.

125
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,677
You just sort of disappeared.

126
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,118
So did, uh--looks
like the two of you

127
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,597
got a chance to-- to
grow up with each other.

128
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,319
Um...actually, um, Mia and I

129
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,071
just found out about
each other recently.

130
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,552
I never saw Felicity growing up,

131
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,633
and--and after I left here, I...

132
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,395
I never saw you again.

133
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,151
Yeah. After you
died, it was, um,

134
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,434
just me and mom at the cabin.

135
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,630
I'm sorry that I wasn't
there for the two of you.

136
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,998
However, we are here now.

137
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,549
Um, why don't we sit down,

138
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,030
and you guys can
catch me up to speed or--

139
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,709
On 20 years?

140
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,557
It doesn't really work that way.

141
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,550
Even if it did,
I'm just--I'm tired.

142
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,439
I want to sleep,
and I--you know?

143
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,358
Yep. Well, the
bedroom is right there.

144
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,318
Just please make
yourself at home, okay?

145
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,914
Yeah. Sure.

146
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,910
Night.

147
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,880
This is gonna be... interesting.

148
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,269
Who are you calling?

149
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,118
Felicity. She needs to know
that the two of you are back.

150
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,998
“You can't. Why?

151
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,391
Look. I'm not exactly sure
how this time travel thing works.

152
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,154
Maybe we shouldn't...
bring Mom into this

153
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,839
until we have a
better understanding

154
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,991
of what...this is.

155
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,959
That's a good point.

156
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,995
William, tell me something good

157
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,673
about the future, please.

158
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,471
Well...you know those
computer projects

159
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,790
that I would work on in my room

160
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,917
when I wasn't talking to you?

161
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,674
-Yeah, - turned that teen angst

162
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:37,038
into a multibillion-dollar
tech empire.

163
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,793
What? Kind of a mogul.

164
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,031
That's phenomenal. That's, um--

165
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,757
1 get the feeling
I'm gonna be really--

166
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,159
really, really proud
of how you turned out.

167
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:55,470
Yeah. Well, um... I
didn't just turn out.

168
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,191
Um...there's something
I should tell you.

169
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,270
I'm gay.

170
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,795
Yeah, buddy. I know.

171
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,834
-You know? Yeah.

172
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,230
Felicity and I knew,

173
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,672
and we just, um--

174
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,720
well, we hoped
that you were gonna

175
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,278
come out to us when
you were comfortable.

176
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,593
You clearly didn't
get that chance,

177
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,356
and that's on me, s0...'m sorry.

178
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,914
Dad, we all have the chance
to get to know each other now.

179
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,309
If your sister will let me.

180
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,233
Mia will come around.

181
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,110
You know, she can be a
little--a little bit stubborn

182
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,999
and...hard to reach sometimes.

183
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,838
Shocker. Where'd
she get that from?

184
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,998
Mom, I guess.

185
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,030
My husband needs help.

186
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,993
Um, did you check
in at the desk?

187
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,275
We're donors here.

188
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,270
Hold this.

189
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,115
I'm just gonna have a look.

190
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,471
Run! Bomb!

191
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,635
Starling General
was attacked last night

192
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:35,231
after a bomb was found
inside Archroyal Capital CEO

193
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,720
Macmillan Fairfield.

194
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,917
Authorities believe
the infamous terrorist

195
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,879
Deathstroke
orchestrated the attack.

196
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,077
Please tell me the
city's better in the future.

197
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,000
Yeah, yeah, definitely.

198
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,918
=You think this is
Slade? No. No, no.

199
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,150
I have AR.G.U.S. Keeping tabs.

200
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,310
He's currently in Buredunia,

201
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,715
which is nowhere near Star City.

202
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,553
Neither is his son,
Kane Wolfman.

203
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,995
So this is someone new?

204
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,595
Yep. Someone has co-opted
the Deathstroke mask,

205
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,239
and they're using it
to terrorize the city.

206
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,510
We need motive.

207
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,591
Well, the vic is some
rich Wall Street type,

208
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,273
and those guys are easy to hate.

209
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,910
We're not all bad.

210
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,798
He's a billionaire. -Say what?!

211
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,515
Please tell me Zoe
is, too. How is Zoe?

212
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,114
I mean, are you
guys still friends?

213
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,637
Yeah. She's... you'd be proud.

214
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,076
Hello, bunker!

215
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,197
Oh, it feels so good to be back.

216
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,350
Wait. Are those the
kids from the future?

217
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,789
Those are definitely
the kids from the future!

218
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,030
Oh, my God, and excuse me.
When were you gonna tell me

219
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,713
about this, Councilman
Ramirez? This is so cool.

220
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,870
I may have had
coffee on the plane,

221
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,314
and by "may have," I
mean I definitely did have it.

222
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,915
It's Candidate Ramirez.
We don't know if I win yet.

223
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,718
Uh, did you miss the part where
these kids are from the future?

224
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,514
Okay. Rene, if you really want
to know, you become mayor.

225
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,360
Seriously? Hoo hoo hoo!

226
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,874
Oh, that's a text from D.

227
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,479
1 will let her know about Slade

228
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,389
and gloat that I'm
gonna be her boss.

229
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,077
Uh, William, we should,
uh, go, let them work.

230
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,390
Wait. But I just got here,

231
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,119
and I have $0 many questions,

232
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,634
starting with why did nobody
say anything about my beard?

233
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,116
Good to see you, Curtis. Your
beard looks tremendous, okay?

234
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,114
I mean, work or otherwise,
I'd like you to stay.

235
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,793
Yeah. No. I just, um--

236
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,633
I'd rather see the
city than the bunker.

237
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,990
Let's go.

238
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,034
I can't believe that's
your son, that's William.

239
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,751
1 can, however, definitely
believe that that is your daughter.

240
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,910
-Okay. Yeah.

241
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,639
Uh, speaking of
which, I'm a little upset

242
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,995
you didn't tell me about
her, but that's okay.

243
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,511
I forgive you. So why'd
you call in the big guns?

244
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,194
-You know Earth-2? Yeah.

245
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,670
Well, yeah. It was destroyed
by a wave of energy.

246
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,834
This fabric was clipped
by it, and I would like you

247
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,509
to try and help me
figure out what it is.

248
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,633
I can--l can track
down some equipment.

249
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,592
It might... take a bit.

250
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,874
The reason why would help?

251
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,600
It's a wave of energy that's
powerful enough to destroy a planet,

252
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,389
so it's probably powerful
enough to stop a god,

253
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,831
which is...what we're doing now.

254
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,236
God. You said god. Um, so the

255
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,034
fate of the universe
is in my hands.

256
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,550
Cool, cool, cool. Yeah.
You guys-- I got it. Ahem.

257
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,951
Hey. Lyla is still off the grid,

258
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,873
but um, she'll be
very happy to see you.

259
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,436
You know, we always
wanted a brother for JJ.

260
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,230
-You and he close?
-Yeah. Best friends.

261
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,549
Glad to hear that.

262
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,559
I didn't know this was
bring your kid to work day.

263
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,279
Eh. Thought I might
be able to help.

264
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,954
Connor was an agent at an
organization called Knightwatch.

265
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,350
It makes A.R.G.U.S. look
like a kindergarten class.

266
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,919
The Canaries are
comparable, though.

267
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,110
Canaries?

268
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,952
Forget it. What do you got?

269
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,513
Uh, found this on the vic,

270
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,829
what was left of him.

271
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,990
May I?

272
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,510
Yeah.

273
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,795
I've seen this before.

274
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,635
A, um, terrorist organization,

275
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,598
they use these to
deliver messages.

276
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,190
Do you have a black light?

277
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,194
Yeah, but we ran the inks on
it already. Nothing turned up.

278
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,711
That is because
you checked it dry.

279
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,471
Whoa. Okay. So
that's our motive.

280
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,910
That's good work, Connor,

281
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,953
Is there something
else you recognize?

282
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,918
No. Uh, that's it.

283
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,959
And that is Mia, so
I should probably--

284
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,793
Go. Go, go, go. I'll
catch up with you later.

285
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,876
It can't really be JJ, can it?

286
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,713
This all started the
night we got here.

287
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,797
Maybe JJ came back, too.

288
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,076
What, and the first thing he
decides to do is blow something up?

289
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,355
It doesn't make any sense.

290
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,954
It does if you know my brother.

291
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,518
"Star City's
cancer is the rich"--

292
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,595
it's JJ's favorite catchphrase.

293
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,150
Okay. We should
tell Dad and the team.

294
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,199
Not a chance. This is
our mess to clean up.

295
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,759
But we could use their help.

296
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,474
I mean, maybe if
♪ sees John, then--

297
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,630
He won't care.

298
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,757
♪ will kill Dad if
he gets in his way.

299
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,280
This is on us.

300
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,750
It's on us to avenge Zoe.

301
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,040
Well, then first,
we need to find him.

302
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,189
All right. You know him best.

303
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,760
You know the Deathstrokes.

304
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,195
Where would he go?

305
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,314
Where it all began.

306
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,633
Are you sure this is the place?

307
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,516
20 years from now,
this place is galaxy one,

308
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:12,036
but 2019, it's where
the Deathstrokes started.

309
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,359
Oh. [ am getting
a case of deja vu

310
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,158
in the worst possible way.

311
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,435
You stay out of sight.

312
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,749
Connor and I got this.

313
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,155
Wait what?

314
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,070
He's dead.

315
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,079
Something's not right.

316
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,075
Don't move... or we all go boom.

317
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,669
Frak!

318
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,230
JU.

319
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,240
Oh, crap.

320
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,719
Why did you do it, JJ?

321
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,270
Why did you kill her?

322
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,559
Damn it, JJ! Answer me!

323
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,189
Who the hell is JJ?

324
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,870
Grant.

325
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,710
Incoming.

326
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,078
Evac now!

327
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,520
Oh, great. Looks
like we made it back

328
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,637
just in time to walk
into a bomb trap.

329
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,792
How'd you find us?
-Later. We have to move.

330
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,314
Might be a bit of a problem.

331
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,479
Buy us a few seconds.

332
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,589
On my mark.

333
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,674
Three...two...one...

334
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,350
Go!

335
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,070
Well, at least we didn't die.

336
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,238
It's a good thing we
were tracking a victim,

337
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,471
or you would have been in
worse shape than that drive.

338
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,675
At least it's still
in one piece.

339
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,114
Maybe I can recover the data.

340
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,237
Maybe you can explain to all
of us what you were doing there

341
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,430
with no backup.

342
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,590
We can take care of ourselves.

343
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,750
That's not the point, Mia.

344
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,399
What were you looking for?

345
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,156
In the future, that building is

346
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,754
the Deathstroke home base.

347
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,674
The leader's Grant Wilson.

348
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,197
Slade's other son.
Surprise, surprise.

349
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,154
Were you ever planning
on sharing that information

350
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,310
with the rest of the class?

351
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,272
-No. Clearly your daughter.

352
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,669
So if you knew it was Grant,

353
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,393
then why did you call him JJ?

354
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,554
I heard you yell his name.

355
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,190
What's going on here?

356
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,834
She doesn't know
what she's talking about.

357
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,990
Then you tell me, Connor!

358
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,829
We came back,

359
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,792
so we thought maybe ♪ did, too.

360
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,792
That's why we didn't tell
you about the Deathstrokes.

361
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,718
Connor, I don't understand
what you're talking about.

362
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,271
In the future, Grant
trains a new leader,

363
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,273
someone who eventually
takes over the Deathstrokes.

364
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,990
It's JJ.

365
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,753
You told me ♪ was fine!

366
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,315
Dad, I'm sorry.

367
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,716
-There's something
else. William.

368
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,758
Look. They have aright to know,

369
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,998
and I'm done holding onto this.

370
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,436
Future Star City
is a terrible place.

371
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,393
It's run by gangs,
the cops are corrupt,

372
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,795
politicians, too.

373
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,994
Does that include me?

374
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,675
We're trying to save it,

375
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,114
but that meant stopping JJ,

376
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,397
and that's what we were
doing right before we came here.

377
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,312
We--we thought we could, but...

378
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,919
Zoe was with Mia, and...

379
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,270
And what?

380
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,389
♪ killed her.

381
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,713
I'm so sorry, Rene.

382
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,635
Rene! Rene, stop,
man. Let's talk!

383
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,837
Talk about what, huh?

384
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,229
About how your son
killed my daughter?

385
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,959
Look, man. I know
you're angry, okay?

386
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,918
I'm shook, too. My
son's a murderer, Rene,

387
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,115
a murderer,

388
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,629
but, man, now that
we know what went on,

389
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,995
maybe we can do
something to change it.

390
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,275
Change it how?

391
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,114
What if what we do
today doesn't make

392
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,152
a damn difference
about tomorrow?

393
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,759
This is my fault.

394
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,639
I'm sorry. I should
have told you sooner.

395
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,279
Then tell me now, Connor!

396
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,310
Everything.

397
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:40,276
When you took me in, I was angry

398
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,634
and rebellious,

399
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,350
but you--you refused
to give up on me.

400
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,158
Man, you straightened
me out, made me who I am,

401
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,636
a soldier just like you...

402
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:00,789
JJ, he resented it.

403
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,710
You know, it was
like I had stole the love

404
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,109
that should have been his.

405
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,758
Maybe if I had been a better son

406
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,953
♪ would have never broken bad

407
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,633
and Zoe would still be alive.

408
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,993
Dad, please say something.

409
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,195
Dad?

410
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:22,595
Connor, since the
moment you got here,

411
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,599
you have done
nothing but lie to me,

412
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,950
to all of us.

413
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,472
What do you want me to say?

414
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,754
Zoe was fighting to fix exactly
what her dad helped cause.

415
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,991
That's why she was a
Canary like both of you.

416
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,794
You guys had a whole
network of them in the city.

417
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,156
And that's what Connor
was talking about earlier.

418
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,311
And yet we still
couldn't save the city.

419
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,515
After Rene walled
off the Glades,

420
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,193
the scope was just too big,

421
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,156
and ever since the wall came down,
we've been fighting the Deathstrokes,

422
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,833
trying to make
things better, but--

423
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,313
1 just still don't understand.

424
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,115
I mean, JJ adores Zoe.

425
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,475
How could he do
something like this?

426
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,080
Seemed pretty easy for him,

427
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,309
so how about we stop
mourning poor, innocent ♪

428
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,198
and accept who he actually is?

429
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,273
Look, all that matters right
now is stopping Grant Wilson

430
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,238
before he screws
up everyone's future.

431
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,197
What else can you
tell me about him?

432
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,359
Just the broad strokes.

433
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,954
Grant made a name
for himself doing

434
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,349
pretty much exactly
what he's doing now,

435
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,794
targeting the rich,

436
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,473
appealing to the
disenfranchised.

437
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,750
They became cult heroes,

438
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,558
which is how he seduced JJ.

439
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,835
Any more specifics?

440
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,469
Grant's home base
just got blown up.

441
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,392
That--that never
happened before.

442
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,195
We're in new territory now.

443
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,834
How long to access the drive?

444
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,154
Uh, more than a
few, less than a year.

445
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,113
I'm gonna go check on Rene.

446
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,477
We should be out
there doing something.

447
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,194
We will be

448
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,999
once we know
Grant Wilson's plan.

449
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:59,636
Are you crazy? How
can you not like mint chip?

450
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,313
It tastes like toothpaste.

451
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,516
Aunt Dinah? I didn't know
you were gonna be here.

452
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,354
Hey, kiddo. Give me a squeeze.

453
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,599
You want to talk to my dad, huh?

454
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,034
I'll go start scooping.
-Hey, hey.

455
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,599
Don't eat all the ice cream.

456
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,999
How am I supposed to
wake up every morning

457
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,276
knowing how many days
we have left together?

458
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,279
By trying to change
what happens,

459
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,589
trying every single day.

460
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,993
“We should talk. Ha.

461
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,510
What are you doing?

462
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,318
I'm going to the
hospital bomb site.

463
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,755
Maybe Dinah missed something.

464
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,951
Mia. -I'm not gonna stand around

465
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,110
and waste time.

466
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,191
Look. I know what's
driving you right now.

467
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,350
You lost a teammate.

468
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,158
I--I--I've been there.

469
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,833
Il can help. I'm here to help.

470
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,389
You know, I survived
my whole life without you.

471
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,153
I don't need you
to play dad now.

472
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,311
Hey. I'm not playing dad.
1 am simply telling you

473
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,118
that it is not tactically
wise to go out there

474
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,237
-by yourself--
~Fine. I'll take Laurel.

475
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,953
When you are
letting your decisions

476
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,157
be driven by your emotions.

477
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,839
Trust me. I've been there.

478
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,990
You don't get a say.

479
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,874
You gave up that
right when you left

480
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,111
me and Mom alone in that cabin.

481
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,119
How could you just abandon us?

482
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,913
Because I chose to keep
you safe, and I chose right.

483
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,599
You just wanted to be a hero,

484
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,073
$0 You put your mission
above your family.

485
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,670
Don't worry. You'll learn to
live without me pretty easy,

486
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,039
just like I learned
to live without you.

487
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,190
Mmm.

488
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,793
I'm not letting
you go out there.

489
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,477
Nyssa Al Ghul trained me.

490
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,669
You want to see how well?

491
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,359
I'm not gonna fight
you. I'm your father.

492
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,597
Really? Because
from where I stand,

493
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,273
you're just some guy in my way.

494
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,550
Mia...

495
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,635
I'll go with you.

496
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,110
Let's go.

497
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,560
Uh...Dad, I know
this is bad timing,

498
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,949
but you should see this.

499
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,155
It's live.

500
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,431
6 years ago, my father
rained terror down on this city.

501
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,595
He was short-sighted, foolish.

502
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,592
This city has a cancer,

503
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,229
the one percent
who control industry.

504
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,714
1 will excise it.

505
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,355
Our siege of Star
City begins tonight.

506
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,398
This might be how it starts.

507
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,517
This is the beginning
of the future.

508
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,757
Why would Grant give
us advanced warning?

509
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,235
It seems too easy.

510
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,355
That's because it is.

511
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,314
Look, Grant may be
planning an attack,

512
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,515
but it won't be on the rich.

513
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,589
That video's a mislead.

514
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,236
This kind of deception
is a Deathstroke special.

515
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,470
How do you know that?

516
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,279
I was undercover
with them for a while,

517
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,229
a last-ditch attempt
to get through to JJ.

518
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,717
Okay. So if this is a bait
and switch, what's the switch?

519
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,075
What do you think
Grant's planning?

520
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,594
Something a whole lot bigger.

521
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,878
I just don't know what exactly.

522
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,951
Everything happening
with the Deathstrokes is

523
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,190
different now.

524
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,357
Well, I've got some good news.

525
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,318
I managed to extract
the data from the drive,

526
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,879
but, surprise,
surprise, it's encrypted,

527
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,309
and since I'm not an expert

528
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,437
in early 21st-century
decryption algorithms,

529
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,479
I've called in someone
who is--Curtis.

530
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,597
Great. Now what
about Mia and Laurel?

531
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,797
We need to focus on
tracking down Grant.

532
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,196
Felicity's search algorithm
should still be on the computer.

533
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,919
Way ahead of you.

534
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,639
Wow. Mom really liked
playing fast and loose

535
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,910
with the Fourth Amendment, huh?

536
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,830
Yeah.

537
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,634
Any chatter from AR.G.U.S.?

538
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,436
No. No, no, no. They
said they'll keep us posted.

539
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,269
Hey. I spoke to
Rene, by the way.

540
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,310
Well, I'm quite sure he's
not willing to talk to me.

541
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,513
No, but I do know
someone who is.

542
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,950
Are you avoiding him?

543
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,950
No.

544
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,950
Maybe.

545
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,199
I've never dealt with
anything like this before.

546
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,680
My head is still spinning.

547
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,229
I-I-- want to blame someone.
I just don't know who.

548
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,316
John, we all failed
to save this city.

549
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,558
Yeah, Dinah, but I'm his father,

550
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,550
so it's on me.

551
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,119
So you did pick who to blame.

552
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:02,312
All this talk about JJ got me

553
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,994
thinking about Andy,
how I failed him,

554
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,234
so yeah, the blame
is definitely on me.

555
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,438
I'm gonna tell you the
same thing I told Rene

556
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,430
because it's the same
thing I've been telling myself.

557
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,189
Knowing what's happened

558
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,271
can either destroy
us or save Us.

559
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,960
We've seen our worst.

560
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,759
Now let's be our best.

561
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,519
In the future, do they still use

562
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,717
the phrase "wild goose chase"?

563
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,355
If you're bored, you can go.

564
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,590
I don't need a babysitter.

565
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,593
No, but you might need backup

566
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,553
when you try and
kill Grant Wilson.

567
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,069
How did you know?

568
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,279
Oh. Well, clearly no
one has informed you

569
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,351
that I used to play
for team villain,

570
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:58,116
and I can spot a murderous
intent a million miles away.

571
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,831
So what, are you gonna
try and talk me out of it now,

572
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,037
tell me to listen to my dad or--

573
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,989
Oh, God, no. I would never tell
anyone to listen to Oliver Queen.

574
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,029
No offense,

575
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,273
but I'm not exactly a very
big fan of your father's.

576
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:16,757
He's kind of a dick, but
you are a grown woman,

577
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:20,276
and if you want to kill
this guy, then have at it,

578
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,160
but I just want to know why.

579
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,316
Because locking him up
isn't gonna change anything.

580
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,151
He escapes every time.

581
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,438
Why he's such a cult hero

582
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,273
among all the worst
here in Star City.

583
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,830
-Including future JJ.
-Exactly.

584
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,838
Look, Grant has to
die so Zoe can live.

585
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,878
I don't know anything
about changing timelines,

586
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,953
but I am something of
an expert on vengeance,

587
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,238
and getting it, it
doesn't do anything

588
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,754
but cause you more pain.

589
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,877
So, what, you're an expert on
talking people out of murder?

590
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,030
Kind of.

591
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,510
I'had to when Felicity wanted
to take down Ricardo Diaz.

592
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,874
My mom tried to kill someone?

593
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,997
No, because I
talked her out of it.

594
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,749
And, look, I get it.

595
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,752
You and your mom,
you're both women

596
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,797
who won't allow themselves
to be talked out of anything,

597
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,359
and I appreciate that,

598
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:16,717
but Felicity, she never
regretted changing her approach,

599
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,639
so maybe you should try
doing things differently, too.

600
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,710
There you are.

601
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,515
Mia's back.

602
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,989
You crack the drive?

603
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,470
Curtis almost has it.

604
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,597
God, you know, it's kind
of annoying how good he is.

605
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,194
Plus he's got this
perfect husband-slash-life,

606
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,149
not that I'm
jealous or anything.

607
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,359
Let me know when
it's done, okay?

608
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,399
You know, I have been
told by several ex-boyfriends

609
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,200
that I do this
moody, broody thing

610
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,759
when I'm problem-solving.

611
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,909
Guess it must be genetic.

612
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,150
It's Mia, right?

613
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,559
I didn't want her
to go out there.

614
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,474
Well, then you should
have made her stay.

615
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,756
What, put her in
timeout? She's an adult.

616
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,718
Yeah, and like an adult,
she makes mistakes.

617
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:19,995
She's right.

618
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,993
I chose to go with the Monitor.

619
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,389
I abandoned her.

620
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,075
I haven't earned a say.

621
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,430
Yeah, but that doesn't mean
she doesn't want you to have one.

622
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,237
Or--or that you shouldn't,

623
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,319
and I'm saying that
from experience.

624
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,275
You have kids in the future?

625
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,511
Oh, God, no. I mean,
don't get me wrong.

626
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,751
Kids are a miracle
or...whatever,

627
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,638
but I was actually referring to

628
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,153
when I left you to go live
with grandma and grandpa.

629
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,993
Yeah, that one's still
pretty fresh for me.

630
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,555
Right.

631
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,718
I thought you hated my guts.

632
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,712
I hated you for abandoning me.

633
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,598
tried. -True,

634
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,512
but I wanted you to try harder,

635
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,077
push a little more.

636
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,476
I think that's all any child
wants from their parents.

637
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,470
I'm sorry.

638
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,030
It's okay.

639
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,917
Dad, I am glad
that you're in my life

640
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,879
then and now,

641
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,750
and Mia will be, too.

642
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:35,318
Um, [ hate to interrupt father-son
time, but we got something.

643
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,350
So Grant is trying
to one-up his father.

644
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,233
The siege version
2.0 is tonight,

645
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,874
and this time, Mirakuru is out,

646
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,599
and coordinated
bomb attacks are in.

647
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,751
- = How many?
- « Lots,

648
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,753
and Grant has them all
connected to a remote detonator,

649
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,194
probably a phone.

650
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,994
The good news is-- and I
use that term very loosely--

651
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,318
is that he set up a relay
device underneath downtown.

652
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:00,034
So we disable the relay
device, we turn off the bomb.

653
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,349
Okay. What about Grant?

654
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,874
He's holed up underground,

655
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,394
where the lines
converge at Water Street.

656
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,989
History repeats itself.

657
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,434
Well, maybe we
can stop the attack

658
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,238
by running the same
play we ran last time.

659
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,358
No. Someone told me the only way

660
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:15,273
to change the future is to start
doing things differently now.

661
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,189
-Rene, look--
-John, we're good.

662
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,589
You, too, Connor.

663
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,239
I can't be mad at either
of you for something

664
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,158
1 will never let happen.

665
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,155
All right. We set up one
team to go after Grant,

666
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,555
one team to destroy
the relay device,

667
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,792
but we also need to keep
the public calm this time.

668
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,434
Last I checked, the
police are still good,

669
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,796
and I'm still captain,
future be damned.

670
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,394
I'll join you. 1 got
to do something

671
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,595
for the Glades from there.

672
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,279
-What about the three of
us? William, I think it would be

673
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,238
best if you stayed
and helped Curtis.

674
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,914
Mia and Connor, I'd like for
the two of you to come with us.

675
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,237
Rene said it. We have to
do things differently this time.

676
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,390
Agreed?

677
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,838
-All right.
-This is my favorite part.

678
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,750
Suit up.

679
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,195
Yes!

680
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:08,318
-Stay close, please.
“Where are we?

681
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,153
You're in the service
tunnels underneath the city.

682
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,397
Basically, you all are in "The
Shawshank Redemption.”

683
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,834
"The Shawshank" what?

684
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,716
"The Shawshank Redemption."
It's--are there no movies in the future?

685
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,359
- « Curtis!
- Oh, right. Staying on task.

686
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,238
Sorry. I'm a little bit
out of practice, guys.

687
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,629
Spartan, what's your status?

688
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,309
We're at the east end.

689
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,312
Looks like someone beat us here.

690
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,829
Tonight, we take back this city

691
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,798
from the cancer
which has plagued it.

692
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,758
We will set its citizens free.

693
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,240
We will save this
city from itself.

694
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:43,189
Stand beside me. Take
back what is rightfully yours.

695
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,637
Let's make Star
City great again.

696
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,835
Where are his men?

697
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,357
Mia, you should get behind me.

698
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,869
I need three units at the docks

699
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,439
and another two in
Pennytown, okay?

700
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,318
Hey. Yup. Hey.

701
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,710
What's up?

702
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,791
Got a press conference
in the Glades in the works.

703
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,990
Great.

704
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,518
Brought you a new
addition to the drunk tank.

705
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,715
Watch him for a sec?

706
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,789
Hey. You got the time?

707
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,155
It's five to nine.

708
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,199
What the hell is that?

709
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,754
Bomb!

710
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,518
We're almost at the relay.

711
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,079
Well, that can't be good.

712
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,158
Mia! Ohh!

713
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,199
Raise your hand if you
know how to disarm a bomb.

714
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:03,479
William, it's an intervalometer.

715
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,715
Where'd you learn that?

716
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,750
From you.

717
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,069
It's most likely pulsating

718
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,310
in a consistently
synchronized pattern.

719
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,749
So it will have a
transfer switch embedded

720
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:12,910
into the mainframe.

721
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,037
Look at us-- Holt and Smoak 2.0.

722
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,194
There should be two wires
plugged into the console.

723
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,595
You're gonna
disconnect the red one.

724
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,273
Do not touch the blue one,

725
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,113
or else very bad
things will happen.

726
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,715
Unh!

727
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,354
What the hell?!

728
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,113
The device has been neutralized.

729
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,510
I guess things have never not
been tense around here, huh?

730
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,717
Yeah. I like to cope
by stress eating.

731
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,911
-Gummy bear? Thanks.

732
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,759
This isn't over.

733
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,878
Yes, it is. -Mia!

734
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,558
Get out of my way.

735
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,710
No.

736
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,039
Hate me if you want.

737
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,794
I'm not letting you do this.

738
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,351
Just got off the phone
with Gotham City PD.

739
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,670
Grant Wilson is being prepped
and transferred to Blackgate,

740
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,558
where he will spend
the next 20 to life.

741
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:56,633
We will keep an eye on
him, He's not going anywhere.

742
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,674
Takes the Deathstrokes
off the board

743
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,154
for the foreseeable future.

744
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,960
Literally. Let's hope it
changes things somehow.

745
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:06,033
- For Zoe.
- And for JJ.

746
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,269
Here's hoping.

747
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,959
Or we make our own hope.

748
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,199
You guys really
held your own tonight.

749
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,554
Well, my keyboard
warrior skills are strong.

750
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,552
Uh, you know, Curtis went
right back to analyzing that fabric,

751
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,358
so I'm just gonna go
see if he needs help.

752
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,080
Thank you, William.

753
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,230
You okay?

754
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,998
- would have killed him.
-l know,

755
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,638
and I know you didn't want to.

756
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,790
Thank you.

757
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,995
Come on.

758
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,950
Hey.

759
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,355
You ready to go home?

760
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,670
You don't have to do that.

761
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,197
I don't want to be a
reminder of everything bad

762
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,350
that happened to ♪

763
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,358
-and to your family. «Connor.

764
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,240
You are my family, son.

765
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,195
Look. I'm sorry, Dad.

766
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,238
I really am. I-- -It's okay.

767
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,351
It's okay. I'm sorry, too.

768
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,394
We're gonna figure this out.

769
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,998
Are you still giving
that speech tomorrow?

770
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:38,039
Yes. You really think we
changed things tonight?

771
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,355
In the future?

772
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,238
You mean in like a
baby Hitler kind of way?

773
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,990
"Butterfly Effect"?

774
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,229
-Come on. ‘Hey.

775
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,959
If you want me to
stop training Zoe, I will.

776
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,197
Nah. I can't keep
her in a bubble

777
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,873
just like you can't
stop being a cop

778
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,117
and I can't stop
running for office.

779
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,909
So don't.

780
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,952
Not all of the future
was bad, right?

781
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,954
Just do the good stuff.

782
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,557
I mean, the Canary
network's not a bad idea.

783
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,629
Could be useful.

784
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,440
Then why wait for a future
we can start making now?

785
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,277
So this is what you
wanted to show me,

786
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,959
Grandpa's grave?

787
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,869
Did your mother
ever mention him?

788
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,150
Not really.

789
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,078
I suppose she wouldn't
know what to say.

790
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,590
I barely do.

791
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,320
You weren't close?

792
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,313
I didn't really get
to know the real him

793
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,710
until after he died, and, uh...

794
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,673
Look, I don't
want that to be us.

795
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,713
You've, um--you've
lost people, right?

796
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,393
Yeah. Too many.

797
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,671
Does the guilt ever leave?

798
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:54,710
No.

799
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,799
You can learn to live with it.

800
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,998
I can help you with that, Mia,

801
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,159
if you'd like.

802
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,477
I've been a part of the
Glades my whole life.

803
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,594
Born and raised,

804
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,992
and if you're from here,

805
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:28,154
you know we've
been counted out a lot.

806
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,796
We've been told
we're low-income,

807
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,473
we're uneducated,

808
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,719
we're a lost cause.

809
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,750
And if you hear
that enough times,

810
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:44,595
all you can do is hope that
things will get better later.

811
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,080
Now, I don't know
about you guys,

812
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,556
but I'm tired of waiting.

813
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,038
I'm tired of waiting
for the day when

814
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,838
people stop being
afraid of the Glades

815
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,236
and start coming here
to raise their families,

816
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,560
to find opportunities
for growth and change,

817
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,517
to uplift our brothers
and sisters to be better

818
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,438
than we ever were before.

819
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,274
If we keep waiting,

820
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,234
we might run out of time.

821
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,918
That's why from here on out,

822
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,275
we don't wait for our
future in the Glades.

823
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:29,397
We make our future now.

824
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,314
Special delivery.

825
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,794
Ohh! Okay. This is the best
late-night snack you can ever have.

826
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,310
Want one?

827
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:41,710
Why not?

828
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,390
Yes, Curtis.

829
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,597
Do you want the long
version or the short version?

830
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,835
Please say the long one

831
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,035
because I would love to
geek out on this science.

832
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,395
-Did you know that-- Curtis.

833
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,353
Short it is. Whatever it is
it is possible to replicate,

834
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,670
but there's a catch-- a
couple catches, actually.

835
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,275
-Okay.
-One- don't have the tools to do it.

836
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,597
Two-it is super illegal

837
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,955
because it requires plutonium,

838
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,474
you know, the bomb-making kind.

839
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,831
Luckily, there's a
guy, a military general.

840
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,035
Okay. Where is he?

841
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,430
Russia.

842
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,709
You must be the Monitor.

843
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:31,910
How do you know?

844
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,878
Because no human
would actually wear

845
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,519
something so ridiculous.

846
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,031
You ache for the world you lost,

847
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,235
and I possess the
power to restore it.

848
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,149
You can bring back my Earth?

849
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,754
The recovery of your universe

850
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,150
will require a single task.

851
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,159
What kind of task?

852
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,756
You must betray Oliver Queen.

853
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,274
Greg, move your head!
