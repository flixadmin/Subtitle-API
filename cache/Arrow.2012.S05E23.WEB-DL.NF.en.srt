00:00:00,876 --> 00:00:02,252
<i>This season on</i> "Arrow"...</i>

2
00:00:02,294 --> 00:00:04,546
Oliver: Either
I'm willing to do
whatever is necessary,

3
00:00:04,588 --> 00:00:06,005
or I shouldn't be
out there at all.

4
00:00:06,047 --> 00:00:07,215
John:<i>One day,
your actions might have</i>

5
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:09,635
some unintended
consequences.

6
00:00:09,677 --> 00:00:10,928
Oliver:<i>Prometheus.</i>

7
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:12,554
You want revenge.

8
00:00:12,596 --> 00:00:15,975
I'm going to show you
how everything you
touch dies.

9
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,226
Talia: He calls himself
Adrian Chase.

10
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:20,312
<i>He means to destroy
you utterly.</i>

11
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:22,773
Adrian: Your crusade was
based on a lie.

12
00:00:22,815 --> 00:00:24,692
Make it home.
Make it better.

13
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:26,234
Right my wrongs.

14
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:27,945
Survive.

15
00:00:27,987 --> 00:00:29,613
No!

16
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:31,072
Adrian:<i>You used your
father's memory</i>

17
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:33,492
<i>to justify
a killing spree.</i>

18
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:34,869
Oliver:<i>I am not
going to kill you.</i>

19
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:38,539
I am never going to give
you the satisfaction

20
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,791
of being the man
that you think I am.

21
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:42,041
You're wrong.

22
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:43,251
<i>Please help me.</i>

23
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:44,545
Oliver:
Where is my son?

24
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:46,338
No, no. I said
you let me go,

25
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,007
<i>and I'd keep
your loved ones safe.</i>

26
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:49,508
I'll see you
on the boat.

27
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,343
Oliver: I know where
he's taking them.

28
00:00:57,683 --> 00:01:01,478
Oliver:<i>The name of the island
they found me on is Lian Yu.</i>

29
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,481
<i>It's Mandarin
for purgatory.</i>

30
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,243
What brought you
back to the island?

31
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:17,661
Like I said...

32
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:22,249
I need your help.

33
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,584
What the hell's
going on here?

34
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,460
We have
a problem, and I need you

35
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:26,628
to get off the island.

36
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:27,838
I'm not going anywhere.

37
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,381
-Neither is he.
-I'm taking him,

38
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:31,090
and I'm taking
Digger Harkness.

39
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:32,801
There's an ARGUS
supply boat

40
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:33,928
that is docked
on the eastern shore.

41
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:36,221
You take it, and you go.

42
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:38,390
I'm not abandoning
my post.

43
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:40,059
Suit yourself.

44
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:41,268
Unh!

45
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:50,819
Would you like to
explain what's going on?

46
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:54,573
I'd like to talk
about you for a minute.

47
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:56,951
-You seem...
-What, in possession

48
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,536
of all my marbles?

49
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:04,083
The Mirakuru wore off
a long time ago, kid.

50
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,543
I mean, I remember
everything that
happened.

51
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:09,129
I'm not trying to
escape that,

52
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:13,801
but it feels like
some bad dream.

53
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:16,971
Now, regardless
of my sanity,

54
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:19,014
why do you want to
help me

55
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:22,017
after everything
I've done?

56
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:24,770
There is a man here
on the island

57
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:26,563
named Adrian Chase.

58
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:31,652
He's holding my friends
and my family hostage,

59
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:33,112
including Thea...

60
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,157
and my son.

61
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:38,993
Since when do you
have a son?

62
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:42,037
Slade, are you gonna
help me or not?

63
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,831
I think I'm stating
the obvious

64
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,833
when I say I killed
your mother,

65
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:47,918
and for that alone,

66
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,211
you should have
killed me.

67
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:54,382
Maybe what's happening now
is the reason I didn't.

68
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,301
This is all the intel

69
00:02:56,343 --> 00:03:00,179
that I've been able to
gather on your son, Joe,

70
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:02,891
including his
present whereabouts.

71
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:06,145
Are you offering to
help me find my son?

72
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:08,772
I want us to find
both of our sons.

73
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:35,423
You and me, kid,

74
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:38,052
like old times.

75
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:52,066
You know, if we're going
to fight side by side,

76
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:54,234
you're going to
have to at least
speak with me.

77
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:55,986
I know. It's awful.

78
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:57,445
Pity.

79
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,489
By now, I thought
you'd realize

80
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:01,992
that by disbanding
the League of Assassins,
I freed us both.

81
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:04,036
Are you looking
for applause?

82
00:04:04,078 --> 00:04:06,705
Clapping is a little
more difficult
for me these days.

83
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,832
Have you offloaded
the supplies?

84
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:11,376
Most. Guns and ammo
are still on the plane.

85
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:13,837
By the way, what do
you need an RPG for?

86
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:16,256
Well, like I said,

87
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:18,466
Chase has Talia,
an army of her students,

88
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,886
Evelyn Sharp,
and a meta-human.

89
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:22,971
I have no interest
in this being a fair fight.

90
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:25,557
Is that why you
released the animals
from their cages?

91
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,101
Harkness: Oh, come on, luv.

92
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:29,352
That is no way to start
a new friendship.

93
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:33,774
Look at me again
like that,

94
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:36,235
and I'll feed you
your eyes.

95
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,736
You're not her type
anyway.

96
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,029
Oliver: All right.
That's enough.

97
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:40,321
Let's offload the rest
of the gear.

98

[Rocket whooshing]

99
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:46,870
Hoo.

100
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:48,455
So much
for our gear.

101
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:50,665
There goes
our ride home, kid.

102
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:57,089
Are you sure you
heard the gunshot?

103
00:04:57,131 --> 00:04:58,882
Very sure.
You sound surprised.

104
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:01,176
Yeah. Well, I knew
he would crack,

105
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:04,012
but, uh, I expected
him to last
a little longer.

106
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:06,974
It was almost
disappointing.

107

[Sighs]

108
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:15,816
Kovar: Find him.

109
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:19,945
And, Gennady...

110
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:24,699
no one kills him
but me.

111
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:48,265
Oliver: In 48 hours?

112
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:50,142
Da. In two days.

113

[Gun cocks]

114
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,910
The RPG that took
out the plane came
from over there,

115
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:10,537
and the call
from my son
originated

116
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:12,039
just west of here.

117
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,957
Hostages could be
in either place.

118

Slade: Or neither.

119

This is a large
island.

-I'll check the RPG site.
-I'll accompany you.

Oh, it's almost
like you don't
trust me, Nyssa.

122
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,717
No. It's exactly
like I don't trust you.

123
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:26,053
Oliver:
Check it out. Stay on comms.

124

Harkness: Why does he get
a weapon and I don't?

125
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:35,687
I trust him
more than you.

126
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,605
Didn't he kill your mother?

127
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,816
You listen to me
very carefully.

128

You help me
take down Chase, you walk.

129

You screw with me
even a little bit,

right back into that hole.

going on?

Slade: Why are they
unguarded?

to me, mate.

Don't even think it,
Oliver...

it would be pointless
to reach out to you.

this turn of events,

no giving up

[Gunfire]

165
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,965
6 men are dead.
It's impossible.

166
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:14,095
Nothing is
impossible with him.

167
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:15,805
Where you going?

168
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:18,266
Vertolet. I'm going
to end this.

[Cage opening]

170
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:24,647
-You OK?
-Go to hell.

171
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,483
I'll take that
as a yes.

172
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:31,654
You've been
left behind.

173
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:35,867
You should choose
your friends more wisely.

174
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,744
Oliver: Where is
everyone else?

175
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:39,287
Not sure. Chase split
us up into groups
when we got here.

176
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:41,039
We are gonna talk
about that, right?

177
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,749
Oliver: Yes.
We're gonna talk
about that.

178
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,960
Right now, we need
to focus on finding
the others.

179
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,170
Where are they?

180
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:48,838
I wish I knew

181
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,091
so I could tell
you to go screw
yourselves.

182
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,633
Merlyn: Why did
Chase split up all
the hostages?

183
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,761
Evelyn: Why does Chase
do anything?

184
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:56,888
So far, he hasn't
laid out a single hoop

185
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,724
you could keep yourself
from jumping through.

186
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:02,143
Maybe leaving me here
was part of the plan.

187
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,146
How'd Chase get you here?

188
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:06,565
A plane.

189
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:07,690
You think you can find
your way back to it?

190
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:08,983
Curtis: Yeah,
probably, but...

191
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,818
Malcolm, can you
fly a plane?

192
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,571
If it's anything
like the 3
Gulfstreams

193
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,197
I used to have, yes.

194
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:15,407
Get them to the mainland
and then come

195
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:16,783
right back for us.

196
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:17,992
Felicity: We are not
leaving you here.

197
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,494
I need to focus,

198
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:22,163
and that means
getting you out
of harm's way,

199
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:24,416
and despite
my better instincts,

200
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,626
when this is all over,
I will come back for you.

201
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:29,754
When this is
all over,
you'll be dead.

Thea: Can I talk
to you for a sec?

203
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,632
Yeah.

204
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,429
OK. What the hell
are you doing?

205
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:39,473
-What do you mean?
-I mean Slade Wilson

206
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:40,807
and Malcolm Merlyn.

207
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,142
-Thea...
-No. We are orphans

208
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,477
because of those two.

209
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:45,019
You know what I'm
up against here.

210
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,814
Yeah, so why are you
sending Curtis and I away?

211
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:49,983
Because I need
the two of you to keep

212
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,692
Felicity
and Samantha safe.

213
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,820
We need to get them
off of the island.

214
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,572
OK. Curtis can
handle it.

215
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:57,157
I can understand if
you don't want to go
with Malcolm.

216
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,658
Damn right I don't.

217
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:02,870
I do not want to rely
on Slade Wilson.

218
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:07,459
There's nothing
about the situation
that's ideal, Thea.

219
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:09,836
I need your help,
Speedy,

220
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:11,588
and this is how
you help me.

221
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,883
-OK.
-OK.

222
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,013
Nyssa: My sister
and Harkness fled
into the forest,

223
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:21,848
but I can track them.

224
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,517
Slade: They might lead
us back to the rest
of the hostages.

225
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:25,644
They're our friends,
and we don't need
your help.

226
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:28,062
I see you haven't
lost your feistiness,
Ms. Smoak.

227
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,648
Oliver: Get them
to the plane,

228
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,399
make sure that everyone
stays safe.

229
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:35,028
Comms just in case
something goes
wrong.

230
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,863
You mean "when," right?

231
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:38,739
That's detailed
satellite imagery
of the island.

232
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,992
Again, just in case.

233
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,709
What was that for?

234
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:52,003
Just in case.

235
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:53,421
We're gonna make
it through this.

236
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:55,173
You can't know
that for sure.

237
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:59,969
I didn't want to regret
not kissing you.

238
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:01,638
When it comes
to the two of us,

239
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,348
I regret enough
as it is.

240
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,850
Let's talk more
about this when we're
off the island.

241
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:13,816
You all keep
each other safe.

Quentin: Nice place.

244

This island got
a Big Belly Burger, too?

245
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:27,788
Before the Chinese
turned Lian Yu
into a prison,

246
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,666
it was a holy retreat.

247
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,125
And now you're
using it for payback

248
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,335
for a guy
you barely know

249
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:33,712
on a guy you
barely know.

250
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:35,213
Chase freed me.

251
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:37,424
I don't owe
Oliver Queen a thing.

252
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,600
-John!
-Hey.

253
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:48,685
Rene: Hoss, you OK?

254
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:49,936
Rene.

Black Siren: OK, everyone.
Calm down.

256
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,314
The four of you are gonna
have plenty of time

257
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:55,692
to catch up.

258
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:56,901
See you later.

259
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:00,988
John: I'm assuming that
you tried your sonic scream.

260
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,700
Sonic dampener.

261
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:05,326
I can't even whistle.

262
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:07,245
Don't worry.
Oliver will get
us out of this.

263
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:10,248
Yeah? What makes you
think he even knows
where we are?

264
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,220
The trail's
gone cold.

265
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:25,804
Are you sure?

266
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:28,600
No doubt my
sister knew we
would follow.

267
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:30,184
Let me go on ahead,

268
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,394
see if I can recover
the trail.

269
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:32,562
OK.

270
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,566
So instead of
marrying the blonde,

271
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:39,235
you marry
Ra's al Ghul's
daughter?

272
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:42,530
Uh...Nyssa talks
too much.

273
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:45,158
She hasn't explained
your beef with Chase.

274
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:50,037
My past is coming back
to haunt me.

275
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,124
Seems to be
a recurring theme
with you, kid.

276
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,959
Don't know why.

277
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,337
Well, it's not really
that complicated.

278
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:59,922
You suffer
from survivor's guilt.

279
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,967
You can't get
over the death
of your father.

280
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,637
Adrian Chase has
nothing to do
with my father.

281
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:07,096
Kid, when it comes
to you,

282
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:10,350
everything has to do
with your father.

283
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,935
You and I are not
dissimilar.

284
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:15,854
We're both haunted
by our pasts,

285
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:18,775
and the only way
to bury that ghost

286
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:20,401
is by forgiving
yourself.

287
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:23,530
Forgiving myself
for what?

288
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:27,241
You blame yourself
for your father's
suicide

289
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:30,411
and everything else that
has gone wrong since.

290
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:33,998
You need to
forgive yourself
for your sins.

291
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,501
You say that like
it's easy.

292
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,295
It's the hardest thing
in this world.

293
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,551
If the two of you
are done relaxing,

294
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,344
I've picked up the trail.

295
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:56,312
There's something
I need to tell you.

296
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:57,731
Yeah. Can we save
the horribly awkward
conversation

297
00:14:57,772 --> 00:14:59,399
for when we're
off this island?

298
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,234
No. That's what
I need to say.

299
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,236
When we get
to the airplane,
I'm not gonna get on it.

300
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:05,530
-What?
-I'm not leaving William behind.

301
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:06,740
No. Oliver
will bring him back.

302
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:09,868
I know, but I can't
abandon my son.

303
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:14,664
You know, for what
it's worth,

304
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:16,583
I wasn't in favor
of sending William away,

305
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,877
not that I was
consulted.

306
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,920
Is that why you two
broke up?

307
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:23,005
I'm sorry. I just...
I saw you're not wearing
your engagement ring.

308
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:26,467
No. I know. It's just...
it was complicated,
you know?

309
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:29,178
I saw that kiss
you gave him.

310
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,180
Doesn't seem
that complicated to me.

311
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:41,023
You know, I traveled
halfway across the world
to rescue you.

312
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:42,567
I thought it would
at least entitle me
to a conversation.

313
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:44,569
Yeah? Well, it doesn't.

314
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:46,780
Did it every occur
to you that I'm here
because I'm your father?

315
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:48,364

to get blown up
sky high.

the engine.

Curtis: John's right.
There's definitely
something wrong.

645
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:41,116
With the plane
or the pilot...
no offense.

646

John: None taken.
I'm no ace,

647
00:36:42,868 --> 00:36:44,243
but I know how
to start a plane.

648

it's not pilot error.

from the wing.

that's what I think it is.

that's an on-wing
hydraulic system.

With what tools?

657
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:03,055
So we're stuck here.
Is that what you're
saying?
