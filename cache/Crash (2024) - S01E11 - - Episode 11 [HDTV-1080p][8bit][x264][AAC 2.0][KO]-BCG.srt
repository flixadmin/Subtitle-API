1
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:33,950
CRASH

2
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,244
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, EVENTS,

3
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:38,955
GROUPS, AND BACKGROUNDS
IN THIS WORK ARE FICTIONAL

4
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,792
Under the pretext
of ensuring safety for our citizens,

5
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:45,670
I failed to educate my son properly.

6
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,631
This is the result of my unrighteousness.

7
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:55,055
Please say a few more words.

8
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:57,891
Commissioner General.

9
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:02,103
- Please comment on this.
- How will you take responsibility?

10
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,155
Where are you going?

11
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:13,865
Why are you--

12
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:22,540
You are…

13
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:25,502
Pyo Myunghak.

14
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:27,837
If you try anything funny,

15
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,298
you'll end up
at the bottom of a river with me.

16
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:33,843
Lieutenant.

17
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:37,180
- Commissioner General Pyo was kidnapped.
- What? Kidnapped?

18
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:39,265
His vehicle is missing.

19
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:41,726
Stop the car right this instant.

20
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:45,647
Are you out of your mind?

21
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:48,608
- If we get into an accident--
- Your phone.

22
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:53,822
- Give me your phone.
- Hey! Okay.

23
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:05,875
- Did we identify the kidnapper?
- Not yet.

24
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,171
Attention. It's an emergency.

25
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:13,299
Put out an APB for the vehicle
and check all the traffic cameras.

26
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,301
Why are you doing this?

27
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:16,386
Why?

28
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:18,638
Do you really not know?

29
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,975
I explained myself
at the press conference.

30
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:23,768
I knew nothing of this.

31
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:24,978
So you didn't know?

32
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:29,357
While your son reached that state,
you had no idea, huh?

33
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,026
I wouldn't have left him in that state,
had I known.

34
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:38,324
How may I help you?

35
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:41,077
Well, the patient who was here…

36
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,288
She passed away two days ago.

37
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,209
Listen.

38
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:52,172
I have no idea why you're doing this,
but stop the car.

39
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,966
If you stop here,
I'll pretend this never happened.

40
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:56,926
You shouldn't do that.

41
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:04,350
Listen. Come on.

42
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:05,435
JUNG CHAEMAN

43
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,770
My goodness.

44
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:17,322
- Inspector Cha.
- Mr. Lee Jungsub abducted Pyo Myunghak.

45
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:20,366
He did it with Pyo Myunghak's car.
The police put out an APB.

46
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,036
His phone is still on,
so locate it and report to me.

47
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:25,622
- Yes, sir.
- <i>Inspector Cha, keep calling him.</i>

48
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,999
- He might answer your call.
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

49
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,837
What exactly do you want from me?

50
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:37,425
This won't solve a thing.
It doesn't change anything.

51
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:39,928
It's all in the past, no?

52
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:42,430
Forget about the past
and focus on the future.

53
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:45,016
How much longer will you be
hung up on the past?

54
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,227
"Forget about the past"?

55
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:51,356
Sure. I wanted to forget about it too.

56
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,607
However,

57
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,401
you don't have the right to say that.

58
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,489
Even if everyone in the world
forgot about it,

59
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,408
you shouldn't.

60
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:08,623
Someone like you
shouldn't be in that position.

61
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,669
No. Someone like you shouldn't be alive.

62
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:15,672
Regarding your wrongdoings,

63
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:20,802
you have no hint of remorse or reflection.

64
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:25,473
You deserve to die!

65
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,690
Where on earth is he?

66
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:36,943
MIN SOHEE

67
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:40,113
<i>Captain, they're passing Gahan Interchange
on the outer ring road.</i>

68
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:41,114
Okay.

69
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,825
Jungsub…

70
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,746
CHA YEONHO

71
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:54,669
- <i>Sir.</i>
- Yeonho.

72
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:57,714
I'll take Pyo Myunghak with me.

73
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,049
We must get rid of him

74
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:04,220
so that his son
will get the punishment he deserves.

75
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,139
<i>Sir, please don't do that.</i>

76
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:07,265
Please leave it to me.

77
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:09,934
- I'll catch Pyo Myunghak.
- <i>No.</i>

78
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:12,353
I should've done it sooner

79
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:15,315
before Minsung made such a decision.

80
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:18,568
<i>Yeonho.</i>

81
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:23,197
You uncovered the truth
behind Hyunsoo's wrongful death.

82
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,034
- Thank you.
- <i>Sir.</i>

83
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:28,953
Listen, I have evidence.

84
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,080
I won't fall for such a trick.

85
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,415
I'm serious.

86
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:35,293
If I died, you'd never find the report.

87
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41,591
- <i>Sir?</i>
- Let go!

88
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:42,508
<i>Sir!</i>

89
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,179
Damn it. Let go!

90
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:05,198
My goodness! Help! Please save me!

91
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,368
Jungsub, come to your senses!

92
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:09,952
Here!

93
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,670
Jungsub, stop the car!

94
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,173
Jungsub, come to your senses!

95
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:23,966
Stop the car!

96
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,928
Please!

97
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:31,682
Here! Over here!

98
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,351
Come on!

99
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:40,149
No!

100
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,901
Come on, stop!

101
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:56,707
- Jungsub.
- Let go of me!

102
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,377
Give me the evidence.

103
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:01,838
What evidence?

104
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:04,590
Evidence that your son killed my daughter.

105
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,845
Of course, there's no such thing.

106
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,347
- You little…
- Jungsub.

107
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,598
- Let go.
- Calm down.

108
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:15,351
- I'll kill this bastard with my own hands.
- Please.

109
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,644
Let go of me!

110
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:18,187
- Let go!
- Jungsub.

111
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,065
- How-- How could you!
- Please!

112
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:35,955
Here.

113
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,582
Geez, you sure took your time.

114
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:39,208
Get rid of him.

115
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,627
I'm fine, so get rid of him.

116
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,220
My goodness.

117
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,139
I survived thanks to you.

118
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,851
Thanks, Chaeman.

119
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:04,233
Hey, I need someone to drive.

120
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,819
- Hey, someone drive.
- Yes, sir.

121
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:13,326
CRASH

122
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,495
EPISODE 11

123
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:19,665
Why did you do that?

124
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:25,254
I wanted to fulfill my fatherly duty
one last time.

125
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,388
You may get mitigation of sentence,

126
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:37,058
but it'll be hard
to avoid a prison sentence.

127
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:38,684
I'm well aware.

128
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,354
Do you regret it?

129
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,108
Yes, I regret--

130
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,610
that I hesitated.

131
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:53,032
I believed him when he said
that he had evidence.

132
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,410
There's no way he'd leave such a thing.

133
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:01,541
As you probably learned
from the press conference,

134
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,211
Pyo Myunghak will use any means
to evade responsibility.

135
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,922
I won't let that happen.

136
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:13,553
I feel like I've left you alone
in this difficult fight.

137
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,640
I'm sorry, Yeonho.

138
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:25,982
Enter.

139
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:32,822
What brings you here?
You couldn't be reached.

140
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:43,666
I'm here to pick you up.

141
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:53,301
<i>Mr. Lee, a man in his 60s,</i>

142
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:56,512
<i>who attempted to kidnap and murder
Commissioner General Pyo Myunghak,</i>

143
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,556
<i>turned out to be the father of the victim</i>

144
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:00,891
<i>who was killed by
Commissioner General Pyo's son</i>

145
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:02,977
<i>during the Eundong Junction accident.</i>

146
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,812
<i>It was a premeditated crime that was…</i>

147
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:06,522
What's up with the wheelchair?

148
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,899
What's that on his arm?
He's wearing a mask too.

149
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,693
There wasn't even an accident.

150
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:13,863
<i>- He pleaded for leniency on the culprit.</i>
- Leniency? How dare he.

151
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:16,449
The kidnapper

152
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,910
is a colleague who worked
in the police force with me

153
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,038
in the past.

154
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,749
I understand how devastated he must be

155
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:26,959
<i>about losing his child.</i>

156
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:31,631
<i>So I ask for leniency from the judiciary.</i>

157
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:33,674
<i>In addition,</i>

158
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:37,136
<i>for the impartial investigation
of the case my son was involved in</i>

159
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:39,847
<i>regarding Ms. Lee Hyunsoo's death,</i>

160
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,223
<i>I'll transfer the case…</i>

161
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,975
I'LL UNCOVER THE TRUTH
BEHIND MY SON'S CASE

162
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,478
<i>…to the prosecution.</i>

163
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:50,107
Stop it already.
How far will you take this?

164
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,030
The public opinion has shifted favorably.

165
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:59,450
People are praising you
for the leniency towards the kidnapper

166
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:01,702
and for transferring the case
to prosecution.

167
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,456
They're as good as dogs and cows.

168
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,668
What did Chairman Yang
give the prosecutor?

169
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,252
Oh, well…

170
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,924
It's a photo that was taken
on the day of the accident.

171
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,303
Hey, let's take a photo.

172
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:24,850
Yang Jaeyoung, that sneaky bastard,
had a photo like this.

173
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:30,147
Had I known, I would've coaxed
Chairman Yang.

174
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,274
I cut him off too hastily.

175
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:38,239
It'll be hard to deny the fact
that Jungwook was behind the wheel.

176
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:40,574
Are you saying that there isn't a way?

177
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,076
Of course not.

178
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,579
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

179
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,293
Mr. Han Kyungsoo.

180
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,713
WITNESS

181
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,631
Is the one who drove

182
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,842
and killed Ms. Lee Hyunsoo
by running her over

183
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:01,387
Mr. Pyo Jungwook over there?

184
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:08,853
Yes.

185
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:12,314
When the accident occurred,
why did you say that you drove?

186
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,192
Jungwook…

187
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,112
No, to be more precise,

188
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,574
Jungwook's father made me do it.

189
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:23,576
He said he'd cover up the accident.

190
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:25,911
He was Chief of Eunseong Police Station.

191
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:28,414
Then why did you change your mind?

192
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:32,460
Had you kept quiet,
this case would've remained buried.

193
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,049
That day,

194
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:42,094
my friend killed someone.

195
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:44,764
I'm both a bystander

196
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,849
and a sympathizer who stayed quiet.

197
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,146
It's belated
but I wanted to atone for my crime.

198
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:54,982
That is…

199
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,528
the best I can do

200
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,364
for the deceased's family.

201
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:07,661
No further comments.

202
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,290
Attorney, you may begin.

203
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:13,918
Mr. Han.

204
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:19,215
Didn't you ask the suspect
for 300 million won?

205
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,093
I…

206
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:24,720
300 million won?

207
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,515
I did ask for money, but that was--

208
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:29,975
You requested 300 million won
for switching the driver.

209
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,811
But when the suspect refused,

210
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:35,523
you held a grudge
and set out to frame him!

211
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,566
Objection! The defendant's attorney--

212
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,776
No further comments.

213
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:57,795
Han Kyungsoo's testimony won't be enough.

214
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:59,421
We need direct evidence.

215
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,177
There might be evidence.

216
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:11,225
<i>Listen, I have evidence.</i>

217
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:13,310
- <i>I won't fall for such a trick.</i>
<i>- Evidence</i>?

218
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:14,436
<i>I'm serious.</i>

219
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,356
<i>If I died, you'd never find the report.</i>

220
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:19,316
He definitely mentioned a report.

221
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:22,903
- A report on the tire mark?
- That must be it.

222
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:26,198
Only that report disappeared
from Mr. Kim Minsung's house.

223
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:29,869
But it doesn't directly prove
that Pyo Jungwook is the culprit.

224
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:32,246
It only proves that Inspector Cha isn't.

225
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:34,748
Despite that, he secretly stole it.

226
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:37,293
The existence of the report
was the problem.

227
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:40,546
Had it been revealed,
I would've been considered innocent.

228
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:43,465
Then it would've reopened
the investigation.

229
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:47,011
If he took it to keep his sins hidden,
would he still have it?

230
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:51,849
Even if he still has it, there's no way
Pyo Myunghak would hand it over.

231
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,731
Hold on.

232
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:00,649
Perhaps the person who wrote the report.

233
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:07,239
So who's on the list of witnesses?

234
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:11,619
Professor Jin Changwook of NFS
who made the report of the tire mark.

235
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:13,370
He currently lives in the US.

236
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:15,581
JIN CHANGWOOK

237
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:22,379
<i>What's there?</i>

238
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:25,633
It's a report on the tire mark
found on Lee Hyunsoo's body.

239
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:27,176
It doesn't seem like--

240
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,094
<i>Retrieve it right away. Now!</i>

241
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:33,724
Yes, sir.

TRAFFIC ACCIDENT ANALYSIS REPORT

TIRE MARK ON THE VICTIM'S BODY
AND TIRE MARK OF SUSPECT'S TIRE

244
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:51,575
Is there something I don't know?

245
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,188
- Professor Jin Changwook?
- That's me.

246
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:24,066
Hello. I'm Lieutenant Min Sohee of TCI.

247
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,109
Nice to meet you.

248
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:27,861
- We'll help with your suitcase first.
- Oh, yes.

249
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:28,821
Thank you.

250
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,241
By the way,

251
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:35,327
will my testimony be any help?

252
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:38,372
Of course. I'm certain it'll help.

253
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,461
Hey, get out.

254
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,087
Hey, can't you drive properly?

255
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:30,799
- Hurry up and get out.
- How can you stop the car that way?

256
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,426
Hey. I said get out.

257
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:34,178
- Come on out!
- Hurry up, okay?

258
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:39,391
You punks messed with the wrong woman!

259
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:42,019
- Excuse me?
- You guys won't get paid today.

260
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:44,063
- Shall we get started?
- Yeah, sure.

261
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,230
Hey.

262
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,399
- Did you just push me?
- What are you going to do?

263
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,943
- You want to die?
- For goodness' sake.

264
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:52,279
What's wrong?

265
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:55,282
I'm Detective Woo
who flew from the US to eat LA galbi.

266
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:57,367
What's going on here?

267
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,704
Gosh, I'm still jet-lagged.

268
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,082
- What do you want?
- No.

269
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:05,417
- There was a misunderstanding.
- That's right.

270
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,252
- What misunderstanding?
- Well…

271
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,505
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

272
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,090
- I'm sorry.
- Get going then.

273
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,052
The Korean subway is convenient, right?

274
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:17,179
- It's faster than a car.
- Right.

275
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:20,140
- It's this way.
- Okay.

276
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:23,185
COURT AND PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE

277
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,292
Your Honor.

278
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:50,879
I'd like to call Commissioner General
Pyo Myunghak as a witness.

279
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:56,552
He isn't on the list of witnesses.

280
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,345
Right.

281
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:00,931
But being the defendant's father,

282
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:03,350
he is deeply involved in this case.

283
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,229
Does the defendant's attorney agree?

284
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:11,775
Yes, Your Honor.

285
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,277
Okay then.

286
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,779
Witness, come forward.

287
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:20,742
<i>Commissioner General.</i>

288
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,287
If the report will be revealed anyway,

289
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,580
let's get a jump on them.

290
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,165
What do you mean?

291
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,666
Don't let them reveal it.

292
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,502
You should reveal it yourself.

293
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:37,801
Are you telling me
to reveal the report first?

294
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:42,347
The Seoul Commissioner General
who's merciless, even to his own son.

295
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:47,394
Isn't it the biggest virtue citizens seek
in a high-ranking official?

296
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,066
You asked to be a witness

297
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,485
because you had something to say
about the case.

298
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:58,155
That's right.

299
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:00,324
What is it?

300
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:04,536
A few days ago,

301
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,872
I received this anonymously.

302
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,919
It's a National Forensic Service report.

303
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:16,089
It's an analysis report of the tire mark
on the victim, Lee Hyunsoo's body.

304
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,009
According to the report,

305
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:23,180
the tire mark that was left
on the victim's body

306
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:27,392
doesn't match the tires
of the suspect, Cha Yeonho's car.

307
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:38,362
You said you received it
anonymously a few days ago.

308
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:41,573
Have you ever received this report before?

309
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,367
No.

310
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:46,912
Why wasn't this report revealed
at the time of the accident?

311
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,832
I'm curious about that too.

312
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,628
And there's one more thing.

313
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:58,257
In the report, the tires
that left marks on the victim's body

314
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,341
have been identified.

315
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:04,513
But they are…

316
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,310
the same kind as the ones of my car

317
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:15,107
which was driven by my son
at the time of the accident.

318
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:25,534
Do you know that this is evidence
against the defendant, your son?

319
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,244
Yes, I do.

320
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,288
However,

321
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,498
before I'm someone's father,

322
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,751
I'm an officer who is in charge
of citizens' safety.

323
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:37,129
That's the reason why

324
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:40,215
I submitted this report.

325
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:49,141
Please calm down.

326
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,601
- Defendant.
- Please.

327
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,562
You are at court!

328
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,439
Be respectful.

329
00:21:58,567 --> 00:21:59,568
I'm sorry.

330
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:03,322
It's just that this trial is so touching.

331
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:07,409
It really moved my heart. Wow.

332
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:14,624
Your Honor

333
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,085
and prosecutor…

334
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,216
I'll just reveal everything.

335
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:29,348
Jungwook.

336
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:35,354
Hey.

337
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:37,939
What is he doing? Is he driving?

338
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:40,609
What are you doing? You bastard!

339
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:49,368
Please…

340
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,215
You crazy bastard!

341
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:04,299
Be quiet.

342
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,260
I said be quiet!

343
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,309
An accident? What accident?

344
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:18,063
<i>I was driving your car</i>
<i>and ended up running someone over.</i>

345
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:22,109
<i>Damn it. Hey, listen to me carefully.</i>

346
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:24,778
<i>From this moment on,
you guys are just witnesses.</i>

347
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:26,279
<i>You guys saw her by chance.</i>

348
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:28,115
<i>You were driving out of curiosity.</i>

349
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:31,159
<i>But you saw an accident
so you made a report.</i>

350
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,578
<i>Don't say anything else.</i>

351
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:36,081
<i>I'll take care of the rest.</i>

352
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:39,126
It was my father
who ordered us to act like witnesses.

353
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:43,755
It was my father who said
he'd take care of the rest.

354
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:47,676
It was my father who hid
the National Forensic Service report.

355
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:51,346
Your Honor,
my son is not in his right mind.

356
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:55,517
- Being a drug addict, he's currently--
- Sit down.

357
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,855
Gosh, seriously. Father, it's all over!

358
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:03,066
Someone like you shouldn't be
Commissioner General.

359
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,819
You deserted your own child
in order to save yourself!

360
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:07,362
- Be quiet!
- Shut your mouth.

361
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:08,613
No, I'll go on.

362
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:14,911
I wouldn't have come this far
if it weren't for my father.

363
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:17,956
I'm a victim too.

364
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,461
I was a minor at the time.

365
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:26,798
What does a child know?
Don't you agree? Huh?

366
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:32,512
I'll get a reduced sentence, right?

367
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:11,468
Here she comes.

368
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:13,094
She's here.

369
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,932
Today's trial ascertained

370
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:21,686
the fact that Commissioner General Pyo
tampered with evidence in the past.

371
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:24,689
That day, the person
who took the report on the tire mark

372
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:29,361
was Mr. Pyo Myunghak,
who's sitting behind me.

373
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,281
TEN YEARS AGO

374
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,828
The suspect's car
didn't run over the victim.

375
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:42,415
We should look into the car
that was at the scene.

376
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:45,043
We didn't check the tires of that car.

377
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:46,378
WITNESSES

378
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:47,879
Are you going somewhere?

379
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,965
The office is a bit of a mess, right?

380
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:53,468
I'll be moving to the US.

381
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:54,594
Is that so?

382
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,514
That's nice.

383
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:59,349
<i>I learned later that he was the chief.</i>

384
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:02,894
I wondered why the chief
of a police station came himself.

385
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:06,022
<i>After further investigation</i>
<i>on the witness,</i>

386
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:09,109
<i>Mr. Pyo Jungwook,
Commissioner General Pyo's son,</i>

387
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:10,902
<i>and after securing evidence,</i>

388
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:14,406
<i>we'll indict Commissioner General Pyo
for tampering with evidence</i>

389
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:16,616
and abuse of governmental power.

390
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,618
Was crucial evidence revealed today?

391
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:19,995
When will he resign?

392
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:24,666
No one knows what I had to do to get here.

393
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:27,877
No one knows.

394
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:30,714
I know fully well how you got there.

395
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:44,936
To cover up your wrongdoings,
you deserted your only son in cold blood.

396
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,980
Your son is right.

397
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:49,316
Someone like you
shouldn't be in that position.

398
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:59,159
You little bastard, you're all talk.

399
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:03,663
- Hey, nothing is over yet.
- No.

400
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:05,790
It's over for you.

401
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,419
To reduce his sentence,

402
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:12,213
Pyo Jungwook will put the blame on you.

403
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:17,594
I'm relieved

404
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,348
that your son takes after you.

405
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:43,870
I'm sorry. But I'm telling the truth.

406
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:46,998
A high schooler didn't know any better.

407
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,418
I just did what my father told me to do.

408
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:54,673
I switched the driver
because my father told me to do so.

409
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:00,011
That man is less than human!

410
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:02,722
That man ruined my life!

411
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:04,974
That man shouldn't be
Commissioner General!

412
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:07,936
Where did this letter come from?

413
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,396
SENIOR SUPERINTENDENT GENERAL
SHIN SOJUNG

414
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:12,982
Well, the sender seems to be an insider,
but we don't know who it is yet.

415
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:17,654
You shouldn't stir up a hornet's nest.

416
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,491
- What do you mean?
- I mean, I'm sure you understand.

417
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:23,326
If it reaches Commissioner General,

418
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,787
he'll complain about
not keeping people in check.

419
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,706
Inspection won't go smoothly.

420
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:31,459
Even without this,
Pyo Myunghak will be cut off anyway.

421
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:36,381
I see why every year
Seoul Metropolitan Police receives

422
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:39,634
the lowest score in integrity
among government offices.

423
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:44,931
Thoroughly check Commissioner General's
corruption specified in the letter.

424
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:48,435
If it turns out to be true,
we'll investigate.

425
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:01,573
COMMISSIONER GENERAL
PYO MYUNGHAK

426
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:02,741
Come in.

427
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:09,164
What's this?

428
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:13,501
We're from the inspection office.
We received a letter.

429
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:16,504
A letter? From whom?

430
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:18,757
Let's begin.

431
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:25,096
How dare you! Who do you think you are?

432
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:35,356
I apologize, sir.

433
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,358
Commissioner General approved of this.

434
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:40,945
No way.

435
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,450
Please excuse us for a second.

436
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:48,620
Let's step outside.

437
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:05,720
I never imagined
that you'd turn out like this.

438
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,641
So you want to cut off the tail
like a lizard, huh?

439
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:12,894
Don't be mistaken.

440
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:15,605
The inspection office
secured the information.

441
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:22,904
Do you think I'll go down alone?

442
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,825
Give it a go.

443
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:30,703
- What did you just say?
- Try all you want.

444
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,456
I'm not like you.

445
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:36,709
I'll show you how I turn a crisis

446
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:39,420
into an opportunity.

447
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:57,981
<i>This morning,</i>
<i>Commissioner General Pyo</i>

448
00:30:58,064 --> 00:30:59,399
<i>has been arrested and confined.</i>

449
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:02,443
<i>Nine hours after the request,
the court issued a warrant</i>

450
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:05,572
<i>due to the possibility
of evidence tampering.</i>

451
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:08,157
<i>Commissioner General
is suspected to have taken bribes</i>

452
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:11,494
<i>from Chairman Yang Seokchan
of YSC Constructions</i>

453
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:16,165
<i>for covering up bid rigging
and incidents of assault.</i>

454
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:20,795
<i>Commissioner General Pyo's misdeeds
were revealed from an anonymous letter</i>

455
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:23,464
<i>that came from someone
within the police force.</i>

456
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:26,217
- <i>According to the letter…</i>
- Min Yonggun's guardian.

457
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:27,302
Yes.

458
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:34,976
Dad.

459
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:38,313
Dad. Dad.

460
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:40,440
Dad. It's me, Sohee.

461
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:43,776
- Sohee.
- Yes.

462
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:47,405
Dad, it's me. I'm here.

463
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:49,324
Dad, it's me.

464
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:58,708
- I'm sorry.
- What are you talking about?

465
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:00,168
I'm sorry.

466
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,671
Thank you, Dad.

467
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,506
Thank you.

468
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:07,926
I'm okay.

469
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:09,636
My goodness.

470
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:13,723
My goodness.

471
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:20,647
It's okay.

472
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:26,069
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

473
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:27,779
Thank you.

474
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,952
Don't worry, sir.

475
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:37,455
The Department of Justice
wouldn't want to give a prison sentence

476
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:40,500
to the former commissioner general.

477
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:43,878
The law is made by people, after all.

478
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:46,881
Of course.

479
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:52,136
I will give my verdict.

480
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:59,769
The defendant, Pyo Jungwook,

481
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:03,272
murdered the victim, Lee Hyunsoo,

482
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:06,526
despite being aware that she was pregnant.

483
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:10,947
This is an aggravating factor
in the sentence.

484
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:13,324
In addition, the defendant, Pyo Jungwook,

485
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:16,160
was the culprit who hit Min Yonggun

486
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:19,580
and fled from an accident
on October 6, 2024.

487
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:23,918
After hitting Min Yonggun with his car
and causing serious injuries,

488
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:29,799
he fled the scene without attempting
to help the victim.

489
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:36,723
However, he admitted and confessed
to his crimes during the trial.

490
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:41,477
And as he was underage
at the time of the crime,

491
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:43,938
I give the following verdict.

492
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:50,695
You're working hard.

493
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:54,907
Let's take our time.

494
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:56,743
Wow.

495
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:58,911
You seem to be in a good mood.

496
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,747
You must be satisfied with the result.

497
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:05,334
Well, I guess you made
a big contribution, Jungwook.

498
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:07,086
You put your own father behind bars.

499
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:10,339
Let's have a meal together
when you get out.

500
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:13,551
Hold on. When will that be?

501
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:19,515
<i>I sentence the defendant,</i>

502
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:22,226
Pyo Jungwook, to 20 years of imprisonment.

503
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,196
<i>I sentence the defendant, Pyo Myunghak,</i>

504
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:37,450
<i>to 12 years of imprisonment
and a fine of 1.5 billion won.</i>

505
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:39,410
What do you think of the sentence?

506
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:42,080
- Do you plan to appeal?
- Please comment on this.

507
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,717
<i>I sentence the defendant,</i>
<i>Yang Seokchan,</i>

508
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:57,095
<i>to ten years and six months
of imprisonment</i>

509
00:34:57,178 --> 00:35:01,682
<i>for embezzlement, breach of trust,
bribery, and instigation of murder.</i>

510
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:11,234
How is your health?

511
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:13,945
Is anything bothering you?

512
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,490
I'm okay.

513
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:19,909
Okay.

514
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:22,328
Please,

515
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:25,414
don't worry about me anymore.

516
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:30,169
I'll live well by any means.

517
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:33,798
I'll stand trial

518
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:35,967
and pay for my sins

519
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:38,511
so Hyunsoo wouldn't be ashamed of me.

520
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:41,806
Yes.

521
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:45,726
As you should.

522
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:48,563
You need to live.

523
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:53,943
Hyunsoo will be able to rest in peace now.

524
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,917
Director General Lee Taeju

525
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,961
has been promoted to Chief Superintendent.

526
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:16,841
Congratulations.

527
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,802
- Well done.
- Thank you, sir.

528
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:20,970
APPOINTMENT CEREMONY

529
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:27,560
Congratulations.

530
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:35,610
I thought you'd congratulate me.

531
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:38,529
Is it a cause for congratulations?

532
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:42,867
What brings you here?

533
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,869
I had some business
at the inspection office.

534
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:47,371
There's more to
the Commissioner General's corruption.

535
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:51,000
The unlicensed taxi case.

536
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:57,381
Why are you so surprised?
People might think you're to blame.

537
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:01,719
We should put an end
to the investigation into corruption.

538
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:03,888
Look forward to it.

539
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:42,677
CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT LEE TAEJU

540
00:37:58,484 --> 00:37:59,944
This is Lee Taeju.

541
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:03,364
I have a report to make.

542
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:08,828
While working as an interim captain
of Namgang Police Station's TCI team,

543
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:10,663
I found a lot of things to report.

544
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:13,332
TCI WILL BE INTEGRATED INTO
OTHER INVESTIGATION DIVISIONS

545
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:15,418
The team got dissolved
instead of receiving an award.

546
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:17,003
This is utter nonsense.

547
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:20,506
Come on. They were let off lightly
since they made contributions.

548
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:23,175
In any case, they ended
Commissioner General's career.

549
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:27,346
What organization would welcome them?
Moreover, Captain Jung was on call.

550
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,307
Even so, this is wrong.

551
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,309
Captain Jung put so much effort into TCI.

552
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:32,727
What's this?

553
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:35,229
You used to hate them
for stealing manpower.

554
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:37,606
I did, but--

555
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,525
But still, this is wrong.

556
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:42,570
Why is Cha Yeonho
getting sent to an island?

557
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:44,322
What is this? Exile?

558
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:47,408
Exile is exactly what this is. Geez.

559
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:54,623
Gosh.

560
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:58,461
I want to turn it all
upside down.

561
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:03,341
Since there have been
many alarming crimes,

562
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:07,094
HQ wants to focus on investigations
that will bring public order.

563
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:09,930
It happened to be that way.

564
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:12,350
Captain Jung, you worked hard.

565
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:15,144
But reduced manpower in investigation

566
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:18,814
- may cause some cases to be abandoned.
- You know how it is.

567
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:21,025
An organization is like an organism,

568
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:23,235
so it adapts to new situations.
You know that.

569
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:28,115
I'll get going.

570
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:33,412
Everyone,
thank you for your hard work.

571
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:41,796
Gosh.

572
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:44,965
In any case,
Commissioner General Pyo is gone.

573
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:47,093
And the investigation officer--

574
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:48,344
Now, whom should I…

575
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:49,929
What?

576
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:51,889
CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT LEE TAEJU

577
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:55,267
What? Lee Taeju?

578
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:57,395
Yes. What? No.

579
00:39:57,478 --> 00:40:00,189
He keeps saying
that we should have dinner sometime.

580
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:01,690
Is he your new connection?

581
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:02,858
No.

582
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:06,362
Lee Taeju?

583
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:13,702
I wondered when I'd leave this place.
Who knew it'd happen this way?

584
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:17,206
- Why? Are you relieved?
- Yes, I'm relieved.

585
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:19,625
I'm so relieved

586
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:21,377
that I feel disappointed.

587
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:24,338
- Lieutenant.
- Yes?

588
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,173
Why does this always happen to us?

589
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:30,928
We always work hard
and receive disciplinary action for it.

590
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:33,139
There's something wrong with the world.

591
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:35,307
Or maybe there's something wrong with us.

592
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:37,935
Try to look on the bright side.

593
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:40,312
It means we still have
a lot of work to do.

594
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:49,697
Captain, what will you do
with the plants on the rooftop?

595
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,699
I'll take the expensive ones.

596
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:54,660
As for the rest,
I'll leave them to you, Donggi.

597
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:56,162
Yes, sir.

598
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:59,206
I'll double their sizes
until you come back.

599
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:02,793
Captain, what will you do
during your three months off?

600
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:07,089
Who knows if it'll be three months
or go on indefinitely?

601
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:08,924
I'll think about it.

602
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:17,933
Inspector Cha must be troubled.
He's going to an island by himself.

603
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,528
TRAFFIC CRIME INVESTIGATION TEAM

604
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:53,552
What are you doing here alone?

605
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:56,472
I was just standing here.

606
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:06,899
Will you be okay?
It seemed like a very remote island.

607
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:08,943
I'm rather relieved.

608
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:11,612
I wanted to go away for a short while.

609
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:15,032
And I was feeling disappointed.

610
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:19,745
We'll continue to see each other around,

611
00:42:19,828 --> 00:42:21,497
but only you…

612
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,046
Thank you for everything.

613
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:35,010
Thanks to you,
I was able to hold out until I got here.

614
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:42,851
Don't act like you'll never see me again.

615
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:47,648
Well,

616
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,150
I'd like to thank you too.

617
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:54,321
I wouldn't have gotten this far
without you.

618
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:57,616
I wouldn't have been able to catch
Pyo Jungwook, who hurt my dad.

619
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:04,999
Once a TCI member, always a TCI member.

620
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:06,917
Don't forget that.

621
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:08,961
Don't forget about my dad's kimchi either.

622
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:14,216
When your father is discharged,

623
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:17,052
I'll go pick him up.

624
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:18,470
Who knows when that'll be?

625
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:20,723
You'll come all the way here?

626
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,851
Whenever or wherever it may be,

627
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:26,395
I'll go and pick him up.

628
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,231
Really?

629
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,401
I'm seriously going to call you.

630
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:34,153
Yes. Please call me.

631
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:34,129
ONE YEAR LATER

632
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:45,265
HWAPYEONG ISLAND

633
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:54,942
I get that this is
a security center on an island,

634
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:56,652
but there are only four officers.

635
00:44:56,735 --> 00:45:00,322
We alternate shifts as a team of two,
so we're always on call even after work.

636
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:03,200
It isn't like we get paid
for being on call.

637
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:06,453
Isn't this exploitation of labor?

638
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:09,456
- Stop the car for a second.
- What?

639
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:12,584
Why?

640
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:14,420
What about the cultivator?

641
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:17,089
I saw him drinking makgeolli earlier.

642
00:45:18,757 --> 00:45:20,551
That old man's been drinking again.

643
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:26,390
Sir.

644
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:31,395
Sir, have you been drinking?

645
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:34,064
I just had a cup of makgeolli.
Why are you stopping me?

646
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:35,274
A farming machine isn't

647
00:45:35,357 --> 00:45:37,317
subject to drunk-driving regulations.

648
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:41,155
While a farming machine isn't subject
to drunk-driving regulations,

649
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:44,867
you'll be punished by the traffic law
if you get into an accident.

650
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:46,535
I won't get into an accident!

651
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:48,954
I haven't been in one in 40 years.
Let me go.

652
00:45:49,037 --> 00:45:50,664
No, sir.

653
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:53,000
- No, I'll get going.
- No, sir.

654
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:54,251
- No.
- Sir.

655
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:56,587
Leave this here and come get it later.

656
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:59,923
This never happened before.
What's up with the drunk-driving control?

657
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:01,425
- Please get off.
- I'll drive.

658
00:46:01,508 --> 00:46:03,093
- Please get off.
- You've been drinking.

659
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:06,555
A farming machine isn't subject
to the traffic law.

660
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:07,556
Come on.

661
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:23,864
What were you doing until this hour?

662
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:25,115
School ended hours ago.

663
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:26,992
Why do you care about what I do?

664
00:46:27,075 --> 00:46:28,410
Why you little…

665
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:33,207
Hello.

666
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:40,130
Ever since we moved to this island
to open a resort, she doesn't listen.

667
00:46:42,424 --> 00:46:44,426
- I see.
- All right.

668
00:46:53,685 --> 00:46:55,521
What are you doing? How sentimental.

669
00:46:58,398 --> 00:47:00,692
Come home early. Your dad gets worried.

670
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:02,694
Worried, my foot.

671
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:05,823
My dad doesn't have time for that.

672
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:09,409
It's about the resort.

673
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:13,205
After the divorce,
this resort is the only thing Dad has.

674
00:47:13,288 --> 00:47:15,541
He's so busy
that he doesn't care about me.

675
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:19,962
If he wants to run it well,
he shouldn't fight with the locals.

676
00:47:20,045 --> 00:47:22,172
He always shouts and fights with them.

677
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:24,883
He got a divorce
because of his quick temper.

678
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:27,010
Why does he fight with the locals?

679
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:29,429
Who knows? Something about paying money.

680
00:47:32,057 --> 00:47:33,433
It's frustrating.

681
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:37,563
Mister, why don't we drink together?

682
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:40,190
I hid some alcohol the guests left behind.

683
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:44,903
I can't drink. I don't have
the enzyme that breaks down alcohol.

684
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:47,990
You don't have friends, do you?

685
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:51,910
I have friends.

686
00:47:53,453 --> 00:47:54,663
Code Zero. Code Zero.

687
00:47:54,746 --> 00:47:58,083
A traffic accident occurred
in front of Donggu Elementary School.

688
00:47:58,166 --> 00:47:59,668
Requesting backup.

689
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:02,671
Sun 20, I received the report.
I'm on my way.

690
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:53,096
Come on out.

691
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:56,892
- Come on out, you crazy woman.
- Excuse me, sir.

692
00:48:56,975 --> 00:48:59,603
- That won't break the window.
- Who are you?

693
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:02,898
Let's introduce each other at the station.

694
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:04,775
What is this crazy wench saying?

695
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,402
- Gosh, that hurts.
- Hey.

696
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:10,030
- It hurts!
- It hurts, right? That was my intention.

697
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:12,199
You admit to retaliatory driving, right?

698
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:15,202
You're under arrest.
You have the right to remain silent.

699
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:18,330
- You have the right to an attorney.
- I am one! Gosh, it hurts.

700
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:19,915
You must be proud.

701
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:22,000
I got a text message. Hold on.

702
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:23,877
Attention.

703
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:25,045
Cuff yourself.

704
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,006
Yes, ma'am.

705
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:34,346
<i>We're meeting tomorrow, right?</i>
<i>No one is going to cancel, right?</i>

706
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:36,723
It's tomorrow.

707
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:40,894
For goodness' sake.

708
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:43,438
<i>See you tomorrow.</i>

709
00:49:46,566 --> 00:49:49,486
Starting first of next month,

710
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:51,571
we'll work with Korea Forest Service

711
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:56,034
to begin a crackdown on the illegal
harvest of greens and medicinal herbs.

712
00:49:56,118 --> 00:49:58,036
So make sure you carry your permit.

713
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:01,081
And please spread the news

714
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:04,876
that the roots of the greens
shouldn't be pulled out.

715
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:06,878
- Village Chief.
- Yes?

716
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:09,131
- You had something to say.
- Yes.

717
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:15,429
The selection committee
members of the K-Tourism Islands

718
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:18,682
will come and look around the island.

719
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:22,019
So welcome them warmly
if you run into them.

720
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:23,979
Let me tell you this again.

721
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:27,357
If the island gets selected, we'll receive

722
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:30,110
ten billion won to develop the island.

723
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:32,237
Hello? Oh, you arrived.

724
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:33,780
I'll be right there.

725
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:36,616
Well,

726
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:39,911
I'll get going. Guests arrived.

727
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:43,165
We do all the work,
but someone else takes the profits.

728
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:45,876
Excuse me? Are you talking to me?

729
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:48,420
I mean, am I wrong?

730
00:50:48,503 --> 00:50:51,548
You use all the water on the island.

731
00:50:51,631 --> 00:50:54,760
Ever since resorts were built,

732
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:57,054
we don't have enough water
in the reservoir.

733
00:50:57,137 --> 00:51:01,058
It isn't like you contribute money
for the development of the village.

734
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:05,562
I won't pay five million won, okay?
It's not only once or twice.

735
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:10,233
- Don't discriminate against the newcomers.
- What are you talking about?

736
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:13,111
It's thanks to us
that you're making a living on the island.

737
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:17,699
Before the resorts were built,
we cultivated and managed the island!

738
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:19,076
Did everyone else pay the fee?

739
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:20,410
- Yes!
- Did everyone pay?

740
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:21,787
All right.

741
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:23,121
Stop. That's enough.

742
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:25,665
Please calm down.

743
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:27,209
You can leave now.

744
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:28,835
- Geez.
- For goodness' sake.

745
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:31,129
- That little…
- Why is he so selfish?

746
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:34,883
Is he trying to pick a fight?

747
00:51:38,303 --> 00:51:39,805
It looks tasty.

748
00:51:43,558 --> 00:51:46,186
- Where are you going at this hour?
- A birthday party.

749
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:48,021
A birthday party? Whose birthday is it?

750
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:49,815
- A friend from school?
- Forget it.

751
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:52,109
- Sir, is it ready?
- Who?

752
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:54,319
- Almost ready. Okay.
- We're hungry.

753
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:02,119
- Please enjoy the food.
- Thank you.

754
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:19,928
- Did something happen?
- What?

755
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:24,516
Seunga hasn't come home.

756
00:52:25,767 --> 00:52:28,770
She went out last night
to a friend's birthday party.

757
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:30,147
She isn't answering my calls.

758
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:33,733
- Goodness.
- Do you know her friend's name?

759
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:37,362
She said it was a friend from school,
but I didn't get the name.

760
00:52:37,445 --> 00:52:41,783
- Where on earth is this brat?
- Did you check the ferry schedule?

761
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:45,787
- Perhaps she went to the land alone.
- I called the ferry terminal earlier.

762
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:49,499
They told me
that Seunga's name wasn't on the list.

763
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:52,752
Where is this brat?

764
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:58,216
Oh, right. You said
you were going to Seoul today.

765
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:00,468
Yes, but--

766
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:02,929
we should find your daughter first.

767
00:53:10,645 --> 00:53:11,771
Excuse me.

768
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:14,900
- Do you know Seunga in 12th grade?
- No.

769
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:18,862
- Have you seen her around?
- No.

770
00:53:23,074 --> 00:53:26,536
Did you see this student last night?

771
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:32,792
There aren't many places
kids can go to on this island.

772
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:36,630
Inspector Cha, there's poop. Watch out.

773
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:43,220
This is the place kids gather around
to drink and smoke.

774
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:46,723
The scenery is very nice.

775
00:53:46,806 --> 00:53:48,850
It's the perfect place to drink.

776
00:53:56,691 --> 00:53:57,984
What are those?

777
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:01,363
What are you doing? How sentimental.

778
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:04,908
Come home early. Your dad gets worried.

779
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:08,078
- Seunga's shoes.
- What?

780
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:23,677
Does that mean Seunga…

781
00:54:24,844 --> 00:54:26,763
We don't know anything for sure yet.

782
00:54:26,846 --> 00:54:31,184
Coast guards are looking for her too,
so let's just wait a little longer.

783
00:54:41,319 --> 00:54:44,364
I thought everyone would be here,
but Inspector Cha is missing.

784
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:46,533
A high school girl went missing
on the island,

785
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:48,076
so it's an emergency.

786
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:49,703
A missing person case?

787
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:52,664
I thought it was a quiet village
without any crimes.

788
00:54:52,747 --> 00:54:56,293
Investigation won't be easy
since they don't have many cameras.

789
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:59,045
He'll have to go everywhere.
It's manual labor.

790
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:01,339
Didn't the security center only have

791
00:55:01,423 --> 00:55:02,757
- four officers?
- Four?

792
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:06,594
- Yes.
- It must be really hard to investigate.

793
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:10,432
- Donggi, eat up.
- Okay.

794
00:55:13,226 --> 00:55:15,603
Four? Gosh, that's harsh.

795
00:55:27,782 --> 00:55:30,952
- Inspector Cha!
- Inspector Cha!

796
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:38,460
Inspector Cha, you look good
in your uniform.

797
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:41,588
Thank you for coming a long way.

798
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:43,840
We can catch up later.

799
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:45,258
Let's find the girl first.

800
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:47,135
- Please come this way.
- Okay.

801
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:56,686
We checked with the ferry terminal.
She didn't leave the island.

802
00:55:56,770 --> 00:56:00,273
We found Seunga's sneakers
on top of a cliff.

803
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:03,193
- And her cell phone?
- There's only one base station,

804
00:56:03,276 --> 00:56:06,112
so it's useless to locate her cell phone.

805
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:07,322
What about CCTV?

806
00:56:07,989 --> 00:56:10,241
There's a total
of six surveillance cameras.

807
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:12,702
Most of them are at the port and coast.

808
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:17,123
The cameras set up by residents themselves
need to be checked one by one.

809
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:19,000
Detective Woo will be able
to check the footage

810
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:20,085
by himself.

811
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:21,836
Bingo. I found her already.

812
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:25,173
It was taken around 9 p.m.
the day she disappeared.

813
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:34,724
Where is this?

814
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:36,476
It's near Jinmak Dock.

815
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:40,688
It's a path to Bigu Peak.
It's the route Seunga always takes.

816
00:56:54,452 --> 00:56:55,703
- Lieutenant.
- Yes?

817
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:57,080
Remember those words?

818
00:56:57,163 --> 00:57:00,250
The words the shaman said
at the time of the Kanghee Junction case.

819
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:01,960
- What did she say?
- Well,

820
00:57:02,043 --> 00:57:05,088
she said that dark clouds
loomed over Inspector Cha,

821
00:57:05,171 --> 00:57:07,507
and people who stayed by his side
would get struck by lightning.

822
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:09,926
Oh, right.

823
00:57:10,009 --> 00:57:12,137
I think that shaman was right.

824
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:15,765
Everywhere Inspector Cha goes,
incidents and accidents occur.

825
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:17,267
Geez. Nonsense.

826
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:20,270
This island was known
to lack three things.

827
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:22,272
Thieves, crimes, and pollution.

828
00:57:22,355 --> 00:57:25,900
But Inspector Cha arrived on the island
and broke the rules.

829
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:28,319
The dark clouds. It was his energy.

830
00:57:29,821 --> 00:57:31,823
My goodness.

831
00:57:36,661 --> 00:57:39,914
Look! Here come the dark clouds!

832
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:46,546
- Over here.
- That startled me.

833
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:47,672
What is it?

834
00:57:48,673 --> 00:57:50,550
Inspector Cha, hold on.

835
00:57:54,512 --> 00:57:55,680
What is it?

836
00:57:56,222 --> 00:57:57,056
Here.

837
00:57:58,933 --> 00:58:01,478
What? Isn't this a piece of a car bumper?

838
00:58:03,938 --> 00:58:06,274
Donggi, what do you think
the car model is?

839
00:58:06,357 --> 00:58:08,651
I can't tell from this alone.

840
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:19,245
Worried, my foot.

841
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:21,998
My dad doesn't have time for that.

842
00:58:27,253 --> 00:58:28,630
Inspector Cha, what is that?

843
00:58:28,713 --> 00:58:30,256
It's from Seunga's phone.

844
00:58:34,093 --> 00:58:35,345
Does that mean--

845
00:58:35,428 --> 00:58:37,931
I think an accident occurred on this road.

846
00:58:51,736 --> 00:58:54,822
CRASH

847
00:59:03,414 --> 00:59:05,416
SPECIAL APPEARANCE
BY PARK JIYOUNG

848
00:59:30,191 --> 00:59:32,902
She headed out to attend
a friend's birthday party.

849
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:35,071
<i>I've seen her with a man.</i>

850
00:59:35,154 --> 00:59:36,614
It might be a murder case.

851
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:37,949
<i>Murder, my foot.</i>

852
00:59:38,032 --> 00:59:39,909
That will never happen on this island!

853
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:41,327
<i>Seunga's shoes were discovered</i>

854
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:43,746
<i>on Bigu Peak Cliff
near the end of the island.</i>

855
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:46,666
<i>Someone intentionally put</i>
<i>Seunga's shoes at a different location.</i>

856
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:49,627
<i>- What about the traces at the scene?</i>
<i>- A piece of a silver bumper.</i>

857
00:59:49,711 --> 00:59:52,589
I can't believe this!
Who are you branding as a criminal?

858
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:54,591
<i>She committed suicide.</i>

859
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:56,884
<i>Why do you keep suspecting the villagers?</i>

860
00:59:56,968 --> 00:59:59,262
How dare you cause a ruckus
at such a crucial moment?

861
00:59:59,345 --> 01:00:02,015
<i>Only one solution remains.</i>
<i>We must find Seunga.</i>

862
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:04,962
