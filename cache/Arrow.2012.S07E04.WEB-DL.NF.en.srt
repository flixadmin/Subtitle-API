OH. OF COURSE
HE CALLED YOU.

WHY? TO TALK
SOME SENSE INTO ME?

I JUST CAME BY
TO FIND OUT WHY
YOU LOCKED HIM UP.

482
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:39,942
BECAUSE HE BROKE

770
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:16,354
UPSTAIRS!

771
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:17,730
[CLANG]

772
00:39:23,028 --> 00:39:24,696
WHAT THE HELL
IS WRONG WITH YOU?

773
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:26,239
YOU TOLD ME TO
USE MY BRAIN.

774
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:28,200
YOUR BRAIN? THAT WAS
YOU USING YOUR BRAIN?

775
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:29,951
YOU NEED TO STOP
WITH YOUR LITTLE GAMES

776
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:31,244
AND LET THE GROWNUPS
HANDLE THIS.

777
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:34,580
[METAL SCRAPING]

778
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,457
SHE'S GONE.

779
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:40,586
HOW'D YOU KNOW SHE WAS
GONNA TAKE THE BELT?

780
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:42,922
LUCKY GUESS. THE RFID CHIP
I INSTALLED IN IT

781
00:39:42,964 --> 00:39:45,008
IS GONNA LEAD US
STRAIGHT TO DIAZ.

782
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,592
WOW.

783
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:49,095
-WHAT?
-YOU'RE DIFFERENT.

784
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:51,223
YOU REMIND ME
OF THE FELICITY
FROM MY EARTH.

785
00:39:51,264 --> 00:39:52,640
WE KNOW EACH OTHER
ON EARTH TWO?

786
00:39:52,682 --> 00:39:54,309
EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU.

787
00:39:54,351 --> 00:39:56,978
YOU RUN YOUR OWN EMPIRE.

788
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,479
-THIS GIRL?
-YEP.

789
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:00,357
EXCEPT FOR SHE'S RUTHLESS.

790
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,734
ARE YOU PREPARED
TO BE RUTHLESS?

791
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:04,777
BECAUSE ONCE THE SILENCER
LEADS US TO DIAZ,

792
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:06,946
WE WON'T JUST BE
TORTURING HIM.

793
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:09,282
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
KILL HIM.

794
00:40:09,324 --> 00:40:10,783
CAN YOU HANDLE THAT?

795
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:18,457
THIS IS A WASTE OF TIME.

796
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:21,253
HOW MUCH LONGER ARE
WE GONNA BE TRAPPED
IN HERE?

797
00:40:21,294 --> 00:40:23,838
YOU USED TO BE
A LOT MORE PATIENT.

798
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,424
SHOULDN'T BE
TOO MUCH LONGER.

799
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:28,718
WILLIAM: FELICITY TOLD ME
THAT MAKING A PATTERN
ON A RUBIK'S CUBE

800
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,012
IS LIKE RUNNING
AN ALGORITHM.

801
00:40:31,054 --> 00:40:35,183
MY FAVORITE
WAS CUBE IN THE CUBE

802
00:40:35,225 --> 00:40:37,476
BECAUSE IT'S A PUZZLE
WITHIN A PUZZLE.

803
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:41,564
ROY: A CUBE IN THE CUBE.

804
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:43,275
STILL, NO ANSWERS.

805
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:49,155
WAIT. WHAT?
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

806
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:52,617
IS THAT SOME SORT
OF MAP?

807
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:54,202
WOMAN: IT'S THE GLADES.

808
00:40:56,371 --> 00:40:58,539
YOU TWO REMEMBER ZOE.

809
00:41:01,418 --> 00:41:04,003
HI, ROY, WILLIAM.

810
00:41:04,045 --> 00:41:06,256
WH...WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

811
00:41:06,298 --> 00:41:09,050
I'M WITH THE VIGILANTE
RESISTANCE,

812
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:11,510
ONE OF THE FEW LEFT
FIGHTING TO SAVE
STAR CITY.

813
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:13,805
IS YOUR DAD HERE, TOO?

814
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:16,557
MY DAD WOULDN'T BE
CAUGHT DEAD
IN STAR CITY.

815
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:21,104
THIS MAP SHOWS
SECRET ROUTES IN
AND OUT OF THE GLADES.

816
00:41:21,146 --> 00:41:22,647
WHERE DID YOU GET THIS?

817
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:26,025
FELICITY. SHE'S THE ONE
WHO SENT US TO STAR CITY.

818
00:41:28,445 --> 00:41:30,989
NO. THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

819
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:34,784
WILLIAM, I'M SO SORRY
TO BE THE ONE TO
TELL YOU THIS,

820
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:37,745
BUT FELICITY SMOAK
IS DEAD.

821
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:09,777
MAN: GREG, MOVE YOUR HEAD!
