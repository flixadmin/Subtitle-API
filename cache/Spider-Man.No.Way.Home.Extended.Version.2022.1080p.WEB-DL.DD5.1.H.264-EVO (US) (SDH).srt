Wong, you've actually
generated a good idea.

634
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:51,501
What?

635

The Runes of Kof-Kol?

637

No, not seriously.

653
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,861
The Sanctum's built
at the intersection

654
00:28:51,863 --> 00:28:53,329

655

We weren't the first

That's not how

And it's very difficult
and dangerous

that Ned knows.

Maybe she didn't die
for nothing, Peter.

Okay, so, uh, Connors,
Marko, Dillon and, um...

1904
01:42:20,334 --> 01:42:24,169
I think that I can repair the
devices for Dillon and Marko,

1905
01:42:24,171 --> 01:42:25,203
but the others...

1906
01:42:25,205 --> 01:42:29,710
Oh, I got Connors. I've cured
him once, so no big deal.

What? It's no big deal.
Great.

Yeah, that's great.

1909
01:42:36,984 --> 01:42:41,119
I think I can make
an anti-serum for Dr. Osborn.

Been thinking about it
a long time.

Gotta cure all of them. Right?

1912
01:42:50,764 --> 01:42:52,166
Right.

He died in my arms...

after he tried to kill me.

1923

Uh, yeah, I'm fine.
Are you okay?

You don't deserve this.

Well, I wouldn't give up.

Oh, I'm ready.
Yeah. Me too.

Okay, so now, all we gotta do

1961
01:45:49,943 --> 01:45:52,477
is lure these guys
someplace, right?

1962
01:45:52,479 --> 01:45:56,581
Try to cure them
while they try to kill us,

1963
01:45:56,583 --> 01:45:57,716
and then send them home.

Using a magic box.
Well, that's the plan.

No.

is where we'll do this, okay?

1975
01:46:25,979 --> 01:46:28,179
It's isolated,
so no one should get hurt.

We draw them there with the box.
It's the thing they want.

All we have to do
is figure out how to get there.
