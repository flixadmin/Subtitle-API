1
00:00:00,285 --> 00:00:01,625
Previously on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:01,636 --> 00:00:03,221
H-How is this real?

3
00:00:03,271 --> 00:00:05,604
- This is Novu?
- How do we stop a god?

4
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:06,716
I'm working on it.

5
00:00:06,758 --> 00:00:10,576
Hello, bunker!
So why'd you call in the big guns?

6
00:00:10,711 --> 00:00:12,611
Earth-2 was destroyed by a wave of energy.

7
00:00:12,747 --> 00:00:15,581
So it's probably powerful
enough to stop a god.

8
00:00:15,716 --> 00:00:17,394
- Yes, Curtis?
- Whatever it is, it is...

9
00:00:17,395 --> 00:00:19,581
Possible to replicate, but there's a catch.

10
00:00:19,582 --> 00:00:22,295
It is super illegal because
it requires plutonium.

11
00:00:22,296 --> 00:00:24,103
Luckily, there's a guy, a military General.

12
00:00:24,105 --> 00:00:25,391
- Ok. Where is he?
- Russia.

13
00:00:25,655 --> 00:00:28,340
- You can bring back my Earth?
- The recovery of your universe

14
00:00:28,341 --> 00:00:34,133
will require a single task:
You must betray Oliver Queen.

15
00:00:40,677 --> 00:00:42,844
So that's the secret.
A tennis ball.

16
00:00:42,845 --> 00:00:46,178
You know how you use a honing steel
to keep the edge on a chef's knife?

17
00:00:46,313 --> 00:00:47,446
I don't really cook.

18
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:49,014
That makes sense.

19
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:50,049
All right. Ahem.

20
00:00:50,184 --> 00:00:51,917
This keeps you sharp.

21
00:00:52,053 --> 00:00:56,388
Only a direct,
precise hit will pin the ball.

22
00:00:56,524 --> 00:00:58,690
If you are off just a little bit...

23
00:01:02,997 --> 00:01:04,329
It deflects.

24
00:01:05,807 --> 00:01:08,233
- Ready?
- Toss it.

25
00:01:14,684 --> 00:01:18,077
- Thought this was supposed to be hard.
- This is the warm-up.

26
00:01:20,574 --> 00:01:21,450
Ready.

27
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:28,548
So specialty arrows,
and each one has a specific purpose.

28
00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:29,756
What does this one do?

29
00:01:29,758 --> 00:01:33,682
Explosive arrow, lighter payload,
meant to divert and disable.

30
00:01:45,206 --> 00:01:49,708
Acidic arrow, meant to breach
covertly or weaken structurally.

31
00:01:57,618 --> 00:02:00,791
Bolo arrow...
To secure and subdue.

32
00:02:00,798 --> 00:02:02,254
These are just tools.

33
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:05,791
If you rely on them too much,
they become crutches.

34
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:07,960
Then why have them?

35
00:02:08,095 --> 00:02:13,765
To get out of a fight or to
end one before it begins.

36
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,218
- Not bad.
- So what's next?

37
00:02:33,931 --> 00:02:38,724

38
00:02:44,932 --> 00:02:46,131
Hyah!

39
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:49,401
- Nyssa taught you well.
- Mom made sure of it.

40
00:02:55,042 --> 00:02:57,509
- How did you do that?
- Variable acceleration.

41
00:02:57,645 --> 00:02:59,511
All right?
It's all about timing.

42
00:02:59,647 --> 00:03:03,029
You keep practicing, you keep flowing,
it just becomes second nature.

43
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:06,812
- All right. Again.
- You don't want a break maybe?

44
00:03:06,815 --> 00:03:09,121
She's a machine, dad.
They don't need breaks.

45
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:11,290
And speaking of machines,
I have something to show you guys.

46
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:14,371
I created
a facial recognition algorithm

47
00:03:14,372 --> 00:03:16,375
to find that General that
Curtis told us about,

48
00:03:16,376 --> 00:03:20,132
which was a lot harder than it sounds,
because no offense to Felicity,

49
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:22,367
but these computers are,
like, a million years old.

50
00:03:22,503 --> 00:03:23,969
And Russia is a very big country.

51
00:03:24,104 --> 00:03:25,571
- William.
- Right. Sorry.

52
00:03:25,673 --> 00:03:29,608
His name is General Alexi Burov,
and he's in Moscow.

53
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:32,778
Curtis said that
the energy wave that destroyed Earth-2

54
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:35,113
can be replicated,
which means we can weaponize it.

55
00:03:35,249 --> 00:03:36,782
And right before he went off the grid,

56
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:39,051
Burov was working on
plans for a weapon called

57
00:03:39,186 --> 00:03:41,353
the pulse wave generator.

58
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:42,888
All right. We need those plans.

59
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:44,623
And we also need plutonium.

60
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:46,458
It's the only thing that
can power Burov's machine.

61
00:03:46,594 --> 00:03:49,216
Wait. Plutonium as in a nuclear bomb?

62
00:03:49,217 --> 00:03:51,062
- Mm-hmm.
- Where are we gonna get that?

63
00:03:51,063 --> 00:03:53,765
Bialya.
There's a facility near the border

64
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:56,635
where all kinds of radioactive
material is stored.

65
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,137
I'm thinking a two-man fire
team can get the job done.

66
00:03:59,273 --> 00:04:01,039
- Ok. Want to take Connor?
- No, no.

67
00:04:01,175 --> 00:04:03,108
Actually, he wanted to check in on Sandra.

68
00:04:03,244 --> 00:04:04,610
And he promised to stay out of sight.

69
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:05,944
I have someone else in mind to help.

70
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,082
Ok. I'd like the two of you to
accompany me and Laurel to Russia.

71
00:04:11,521 --> 00:04:13,518
- Ok?
- Yeah.

72
00:04:13,654 --> 00:04:15,320
Ok. We'll wheels up at dawn.

73
00:04:15,456 --> 00:04:17,089
Well, better go buy a parka.

74
00:04:17,224 --> 00:04:19,524
Is it really that cold in Russia?

75
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,828
Oh, oh!
You are so not ready for this.

76
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,666
Things seem to be going
pretty well with the kids.

77
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:30,902
Never thought I'd get to know them.
I like this.

78
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:32,337
Is that why you invited
them to go with you?

79
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:35,841
Well, I mean, I promised Mia
that I would keep training her.

80
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:38,944
And I think it's very valuable
for them to keep seeing

81
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,882
how we operate in the field.

82
00:04:40,907 --> 00:04:42,988
And you're sure Russia's a good
place for a tutorial, Oliver?

83
00:04:42,989 --> 00:04:46,885
- That was a very dark time for you.
- It was a long time ago, though.

84
00:04:47,021 --> 00:04:50,889
I'm a better man. I'm a different man.

85
00:04:51,025 --> 00:04:54,559
I think that I can teach them good
without showing them the bad.

86
00:04:57,765 --> 00:04:59,765
Hope so.

87
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:11,910
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Our mutual friend sent me.

88
00:05:13,414 --> 00:05:16,733
You're working with The Monitor.
Why?

89
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,216
- It's complicated.
- Really?

90
00:05:18,352 --> 00:05:21,950
Because he destroyed my entire Earth.
That seems pretty straightforward to me.

91
00:05:21,951 --> 00:05:25,916
He didn't. Mar Novu is trying to
save worlds, not destroy them.

92
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,593
All that stuff about grief,

93
00:05:28,706 --> 00:05:31,752
you pretending like you
were trying to help me.

94
00:05:31,778 --> 00:05:33,065
I should've known better.

95
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,933
I wasn't pretending.

96
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:38,185
It's a little hard to believe, Lyla,
after all the lying.

97
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:44,107
It doesn't matter what you believe.
You're here just the same as I am.

98
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:47,546
Now, do you want to get
your Earth back or not?

99
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,182
What does he want me to do?

100
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:54,286
Oliver's going to Russia to
retrieve plans to build a weapon.

101
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:57,889
- You need to get them first.
- I thought Oliver was your friend.

102
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:01,626
He is, but this is bigger than him,
bigger than any of us.

103
00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:04,763
Well, whatever The Monitor
offered you must be

104
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:06,498
really something for
you to be able to betray

105
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:08,285
everyone that you care about.

106
00:06:08,287 --> 00:06:11,870
I am doing this for them,
to protect them.

107
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:18,773
- Are you going to help me?
- Yeah. I will.

108
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:20,887
Contact me when it's done.

109
00:06:20,944 --> 00:06:24,350
And here I thought I was
supposed to be the bad guy.

110
00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:36,428
- Can I help you?
- Yeah. I was looking for Jason.

111
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:39,698
Yo, Jason! You got a visitor.

112
00:06:42,102 --> 00:06:44,469
How you doing, Jason?

113
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,305
How did you find me?

114
00:06:47,441 --> 00:06:50,575
Oliver's son... William.
He found you.

115
00:06:50,711 --> 00:06:53,412
Oliver's son.
Isn't he, like, 13?

116
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:58,113
Heh!
Yeah, well, it's a long story.

117
00:06:58,128 --> 00:07:00,112
I have a feeling you
didn't come all this way

118
00:07:00,113 --> 00:07:01,453
just to catch me up to speed.

119
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:04,381
I didn't. I need your help, Roy.

120
00:07:04,384 --> 00:07:07,025
Whatever you're about to ask me to do,
I can't. I'm sorry.

121
00:07:07,161 --> 00:07:08,660
You haven't even heard
what I have to say, man.

122
00:07:08,796 --> 00:07:11,830
'Cause I don't need to.
You know what I did.

123
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:17,035
I'm not a hero anymore, John,
not with my condition.

124
00:07:17,171 --> 00:07:20,840
So you're just gonna walk out on
me, same way you did Thea?

125
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:21,740
No.

126
00:07:21,746 --> 00:07:24,505
Thea told Oliver that you left,
man, without even saying good-bye.

127
00:07:24,506 --> 00:07:27,499
It was for the best for the both of us.

128
00:07:27,501 --> 00:07:30,816
I needed a fresh start,
which is what I'm doing now.

129
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:35,787
Ok, it was...
It was good to see you, John.

130
00:07:35,923 --> 00:07:39,257
Roy...
Look, man,

131
00:07:39,393 --> 00:07:41,293
I know earlier this year
was a struggle for you,

132
00:07:41,428 --> 00:07:44,038
but this crisis is a threat
that's bigger than

133
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:45,750
anything we've ever faced.

134
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:51,436
I wouldn't be here, man,
if we did not need you.

135
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:56,722
If I decide to help you,
it'll be a one-time thing.

136
00:07:56,723 --> 00:07:57,791
That's all I'm asking.

137
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:03,482
I hope you don't mind, but, uh...

138
00:08:03,617 --> 00:08:06,117
I brought you a change of clothes.

139
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:15,427
So this is Russia.

140
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:17,195
Not what you were expecting?

141
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:20,065
I just thought
there'd be a lot less dirt.

142
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:24,135
Is very rude to insult man's homeland.

143
00:08:24,271 --> 00:08:25,737
Hello, Anatoly.

144
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,743
Oliver Queen...

145
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,648
My brother.
Oh, you think maybe I punch you again?

146
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:38,149
It never even crossed my mind.

147
00:08:38,285 --> 00:08:43,154
Welcome to Russia,
my favorite American.

148
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,045
Now, I have seen some very
crazy things in my life,

149
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:52,874
but adult children of Oliver
Queen sitting in my bar.

150
00:08:53,895 --> 00:08:55,745
I hope you do not think badly of me.

151
00:08:55,746 --> 00:08:57,813
Last time we met, you were little,

152
00:08:57,948 --> 00:09:01,016
and I was on wrong side of history.

153
00:09:03,354 --> 00:09:04,620
I like this one already.

154
00:09:04,623 --> 00:09:06,500
I was surprised to learn
that you were in Russia.

155
00:09:07,341 --> 00:09:08,811
I thought the Maldives would be permanent.

156
00:09:08,813 --> 00:09:11,381
Oh, with Diaz dead, so reason to stay away.

157
00:09:11,516 --> 00:09:12,615
You got bored.

158
00:09:12,751 --> 00:09:14,584
I miss Borscht.

159
00:09:14,719 --> 00:09:17,720
So I reinvent myself. Bar owner. Heh!

160
00:09:17,856 --> 00:09:21,394
But I got inspired, too.
I got really good recipe for piña colada.

161
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:22,525
You should try. It's delicious.

162
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,227
Who wouldn't want to be
reminded of the tropics

163
00:09:24,362 --> 00:09:26,429
in these cold Russian winters?

164
00:09:26,564 --> 00:09:28,164
Well, apparently, his customers.

165
00:09:28,299 --> 00:09:30,466
Nice to see this one's still charmer.

166
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:33,423
How's the search
going for General Burov?

167
00:09:33,425 --> 00:09:37,507
Well, it's not very easy.
But I do have friends I can call.

168
00:09:37,642 --> 00:09:40,410
I know, but I...
I don't want them involved in this.

169
00:09:40,545 --> 00:09:43,880
Why not?
If he has friends that can help, it...

170
00:09:44,015 --> 00:09:49,085
Because, Mia, with due respect,
the people that Anatoly is describing...

171
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:53,056
Aren't really friends. Let's just
keep this one in the family, ok?

172
00:09:53,191 --> 00:09:57,605
All right.
I work to find Burov hard way.

173
00:10:04,602 --> 00:10:07,837
You really think an energy weapon's
gonna stop this monitor guy?

174
00:10:07,972 --> 00:10:10,173
Well, that's the hope.

175
00:10:10,308 --> 00:10:12,608
Why this place?

176
00:10:12,744 --> 00:10:15,845
The military stores all
its excess plutonium here.

177
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:19,048
The problem is it's impenetrable.

178
00:10:19,184 --> 00:10:22,351
Which is why you asked me to come.

179
00:10:22,487 --> 00:10:25,555
You need a B&E expert to get inside?

180
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:28,891
Yeah. Well, actually,
it's more of a smash and grab.

181
00:10:29,027 --> 00:10:31,727
There's a shipment coming in tonight.

182
00:10:31,863 --> 00:10:38,968
We are gonna steal the plutonium
before it gets inside. Go. Go. Go.

183
00:10:40,371 --> 00:10:42,438
Why not bring Dinah or Rene?

184
00:10:42,574 --> 00:10:44,974
They have their hands full in Star City.

185
00:10:47,846 --> 00:10:49,612
Must be weird, right?

186
00:10:49,747 --> 00:10:51,781
Oliver meeting his future son.

187
00:10:53,118 --> 00:10:55,751
Yeah.
Well, he's not the only one.

188
00:10:55,887 --> 00:11:01,057
In the future,
I adopt Ben Turner's son, Connor.

189
00:11:01,192 --> 00:11:05,161
He's an agent in Knightwatch,

190
00:11:05,296 --> 00:11:07,430
a future version of A.R.G.U.S.

191
00:11:07,565 --> 00:11:11,200
Well, it sounds like he would've been
a great candidate for this mission.

192
00:11:11,336 --> 00:11:14,871
You didn't need me for this, John.

193
00:11:15,006 --> 00:11:17,340
So what are we really doing here?

194
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:29,519
You said you wanted to atone.
Well, you can't do that by fixing cars.

195
00:11:29,654 --> 00:11:31,821
You do that by rejoining the team.

196
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:34,924
I know you think you can't
control your bloodlust.

197
00:11:35,059 --> 00:11:37,302
That's only because you haven't
figured out a way that works.

198
00:11:37,303 --> 00:11:39,395
Because there is no way.

199
00:11:39,531 --> 00:11:43,099
So whatever you're about to say,
I don't want to hear it.

200
00:11:43,234 --> 00:11:46,335
Look, we're already here,
so I'm gonna help you.

201
00:11:46,471 --> 00:11:50,373
But once we're done,
I'm going to disappear

202
00:11:50,508 --> 00:11:54,443
to a place where even
William can't find me.

203
00:11:58,816 --> 00:12:02,118
I have classic bad news/good news.

204
00:12:02,253 --> 00:12:04,287
I find General Burov.

205
00:12:04,422 --> 00:12:07,256
Is that the bad news?
I'm confused about the order.

206
00:12:07,392 --> 00:12:09,458
The bad news is,
is he is man who likes betting

207
00:12:09,594 --> 00:12:13,029
and blood,
which means only place to find him,

208
00:12:13,164 --> 00:12:15,031
Krovavaya Banya.

209
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:16,532
"The Bloodbath."

210
00:12:16,668 --> 00:12:18,601
Oh. Heh.
Doesn't that sound lovely?

211
00:12:18,736 --> 00:12:21,170
It's not lovely.
It's a fight club.

212
00:12:21,306 --> 00:12:25,041
Oh.
That sounds like where I met her.

213
00:12:25,143 --> 00:12:27,176
He met you where?

214
00:12:27,312 --> 00:12:30,279
Well, when I first left home,
I had to find a way to make money.

215
00:12:30,415 --> 00:12:32,782
So I fought, and I won.

216
00:12:32,917 --> 00:12:36,886
Like father, like daughter, eh, tovarisch?

217
00:12:37,021 --> 00:12:42,124
You, me, and Laurel will go
to the club to find Burov.

218
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,093
You two are gonna stay here.

219
00:12:44,229 --> 00:12:47,823
Did you not hear what I just said?
I grew up in fight clubs.

220
00:12:47,863 --> 00:12:50,527
You did not grow up in fight
clubs that were run by the Bratva.

221
00:12:50,528 --> 00:12:52,001
Then why did you bring us on this mission

222
00:12:52,136 --> 00:12:53,256
if you're not gonna let us help?

223
00:12:53,257 --> 00:12:55,871
This is not a regular mission.
This is the Bratva.

224
00:12:56,007 --> 00:12:59,141
They are terrible people,
and you guys are my kids.

225
00:12:59,277 --> 00:13:03,279
- Yes, but we're not children.
- Well, you are when I look at you.

226
00:13:07,118 --> 00:13:11,587
And I'm sorry,
but this is how it's gonna be.

227
00:13:11,723 --> 00:13:13,422
Ok.

228
00:13:24,669 --> 00:13:27,103
So this is what
the Russians do for fun.

229
00:13:27,238 --> 00:13:29,238
I assume that we want to have
our chat with the General

230
00:13:29,374 --> 00:13:31,140
without crossing the Bratva.

231
00:13:31,276 --> 00:13:33,843
We want to move
quickly and keep our heads low.

232
00:13:33,978 --> 00:13:35,811
There is General.

233
00:13:43,454 --> 00:13:45,955
Damn it. So boring.

234
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:47,356
General Burov...

235
00:13:47,492 --> 00:13:52,928
I am Anatoly Knyazev, Danik's friend.

236
00:13:53,064 --> 00:13:54,630
Danik has big mouth.

237
00:13:54,766 --> 00:13:56,032
What do you want?

238
00:13:56,134 --> 00:14:00,136
Your expertise with something sensitive.

239
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:06,008
Lucky for you, this fight is boring.
Let us go talk.

240
00:14:16,721 --> 00:14:22,358
I abandoned this pulse
wave generator project.

241
00:14:22,493 --> 00:14:25,261
Too unpredictable, bad business.

242
00:14:25,396 --> 00:14:31,567
So why should I give to you, Kapiushon?

243
00:14:31,703 --> 00:14:36,439
Maybe you should've kept
your secret identity secret?

244
00:14:36,574 --> 00:14:41,677
So this means that you won't
be giving us the plans willingly.

245
00:14:41,813 --> 00:14:45,014
No need for unpleasantness.
I am willing to make deal.

246
00:14:45,149 --> 00:14:46,749
Good. What do you want?

247
00:14:46,884 --> 00:14:53,255
A fighter, someone to upset the
favorite so I can not be bored.

248
00:14:53,391 --> 00:14:56,058
Should be easy for you, Kapiushon, no?

249
00:14:56,194 --> 00:14:58,627
So I win, and then you give us the plans.

250
00:15:00,187 --> 00:15:01,275
Done deal.

251
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:05,801
Excellent. I will go make it so.

252
00:15:07,638 --> 00:15:11,407
You saw that Goliath, right?
He is twice your size.

253
00:15:11,542 --> 00:15:13,476
So I give him half a chance.

254
00:15:43,374 --> 00:15:47,042
- You got a problem?
- Nyet.

255
00:15:47,178 --> 00:15:52,281
Oliver seems to think you are hero now.
I'm not so sure.

256
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:57,620
I think you may be like snow
leopard who cannot change spots.

257
00:15:57,755 --> 00:15:59,789
You changed yours.

258
00:15:59,924 --> 00:16:03,359
Worry less about me and more
about your friend over there.

259
00:16:03,494 --> 00:16:07,062
I'll sweep the perimeter.

260
00:16:45,002 --> 00:16:49,472
Ha ha!

261
00:16:53,511 --> 00:16:56,078
Wow.

262
00:16:56,214 --> 00:16:58,280
Impressive, no?

263
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,688
Anatoly, let's get the car ready.

264
00:17:18,936 --> 00:17:22,238
Very good! I don't think you
have many friends here, though.

265
00:17:22,388 --> 00:17:27,992
- But I am man of my word.
- Not so fast.

266
00:17:28,126 --> 00:17:32,730
This one needs to learn not to put
nose in other people's business.

267
00:17:32,731 --> 00:17:36,226
- Oleg, wha... what a pleasure.
- Did you really think

268
00:17:36,228 --> 00:17:39,221
you could conduct business on Bratva
territory without me knowing?

269
00:17:39,357 --> 00:17:42,091
Of course not. This simply
fighter collecting his winnings.

270
00:17:42,226 --> 00:17:45,027
He's no mere fighter,
are you, Oliver Queen?

271
00:17:46,531 --> 00:17:48,197
How does he know who you are?

272
00:17:48,332 --> 00:17:50,566
Everyone in Russia knows Kapiushon.

273
00:17:50,701 --> 00:17:52,968
We have no fight
with you or the Bratva.

274
00:17:53,104 --> 00:17:54,737
That is what we came for.

275
00:17:54,872 --> 00:17:56,939
When we have it, we're gone.

276
00:17:57,074 --> 00:18:00,009
The General only operates
here because we say he can.

277
00:18:00,144 --> 00:18:03,546
- And we did not say.
- No!

278
00:18:09,086 --> 00:18:11,320
Mia.

279
00:18:24,152 --> 00:18:25,552
You ok?

280
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:27,787
Yeah, I'm fine.

281
00:18:27,923 --> 00:18:30,657
Where are we?

282
00:18:30,792 --> 00:18:35,628
Yeah, probably some Bratva hideout.

283
00:18:35,764 --> 00:18:38,999
I told you to stay put, Mia.
What were you thinking?

284
00:18:39,134 --> 00:18:40,667
That we needed to finish the mission.

285
00:18:40,802 --> 00:18:42,402
You understand that I had it
handled, correct?

286
00:18:42,537 --> 00:18:46,506
Uh, apparently not, considering we
are tied up in a creepy basement.

287
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,445
Why did he call you "Kapiushon"?

288
00:18:56,351 --> 00:19:00,186
Kapiushon is a nickname
that the Bratva gave me.

289
00:19:00,322 --> 00:19:02,288
It means "Hood."

290
00:19:03,592 --> 00:19:05,725
You were a member of the Bratva.

291
00:19:08,497 --> 00:19:09,786
You should've told me.

292
00:19:09,838 --> 00:19:12,025
I didn't want you or
William involved in this.

293
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:14,634
- I can handle myself.
- That is not what this is about.

294
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:16,202
Then what is it about?

295
00:19:16,338 --> 00:19:18,004
Ugh. Damn it.

296
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:21,174
We tied your thumbs.

297
00:19:21,309 --> 00:19:24,044
You went to a lot of trouble to get this.

298
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:28,148
Even we couldn't crack
its security encryptions.

299
00:19:28,283 --> 00:19:30,450
It must be worth a great deal.

300
00:19:30,585 --> 00:19:33,887
- Tell me what it is.
- No.

301
00:19:34,022 --> 00:19:37,457
I will only ask once more.

302
00:19:41,129 --> 00:19:44,686
You have 5 seconds. 5...

303
00:19:44,689 --> 00:19:46,099
Don't tell him anything.

304
00:19:46,234 --> 00:19:49,769
4... 3...

305
00:19:49,905 --> 00:19:51,472
2...

306
00:19:51,497 --> 00:19:54,570
They're plans...

307
00:19:54,677 --> 00:19:58,010
For a weapon that Burov's building.

308
00:19:59,004 --> 00:20:00,747
Was that so hard?

309
00:20:00,882 --> 00:20:03,917
Now we can move on to next phase.

310
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:15,228
Ok, what are the chances
that my father and sister

311
00:20:15,363 --> 00:20:18,364
are in the clutches of the Russian
mob but aren't already dead?

312
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,968
Slim and getting slimmer every
second we do not find them.

313
00:20:22,104 --> 00:20:24,737
Ok, their phones aren't online.
Why aren't their phones online?

314
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,974
Will have been destroyed
so as not to trace them.

315
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:30,710
Aren't the people in your family

316
00:20:30,846 --> 00:20:34,380
constantly injecting each
other with tracking devices?

317
00:20:34,516 --> 00:20:36,449
Normally, I would say, "god, I hope not,"

318
00:20:36,585 --> 00:20:38,918
but now I guess I can see the advantages.

319
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:41,624
- Have you ever hacked a CCTV camera?
- No.

320
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:44,190
Well, congratulations.
You're about to learn the only upside

321
00:20:44,191 --> 00:20:46,537
- of a Russian surveillance state.
- Ok.

322
00:20:50,765 --> 00:20:52,899
The shipment should be here soon.

323
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:57,137
What made you wait till now
to give me your big pitch?

324
00:20:57,272 --> 00:21:01,908
I'm guessing Connor told you
something bad about me in the future.

325
00:21:02,043 --> 00:21:04,677
It's not just about you.

326
00:21:07,249 --> 00:21:08,882
Tell me.

327
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,454
William finds you on Lian Yu

328
00:21:14,589 --> 00:21:18,091
after being there for years,
apparently, in some self-imposed exile.

329
00:21:18,226 --> 00:21:20,527
I never get rid of my bloodlust?

330
00:21:20,662 --> 00:21:23,960
You knew all that, and you still
thought you could come save me?

331
00:21:23,961 --> 00:21:25,798
Because there's more to your story.

332
00:21:25,934 --> 00:21:29,435
You may have started on Lian Yu,
Roy, but that's not where you ended.

333
00:21:29,571 --> 00:21:34,340
Felicity sent William to that island to
find you because she believed in you.

334
00:21:34,476 --> 00:21:36,643
You go back to Star City, man.
You work with the kids.

335
00:21:36,778 --> 00:21:38,278
You help them save the city, Roy.

336
00:21:38,413 --> 00:21:39,614
How is that possible?

337
00:21:39,615 --> 00:21:42,949
Because you found the way
to control your bloodlust.

338
00:21:44,486 --> 00:21:47,120
You found that it was
by being part of a team.

339
00:21:47,255 --> 00:21:50,089
You kept your distance because you
believed that you were a danger

340
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:52,392
to everyone around you,
but the real danger was

341
00:21:52,527 --> 00:21:56,596
believing that you can
deal with your past alone.

342
00:22:00,592 --> 00:22:04,594
It's pretty ballsy thinking you can
give me the answer 20 years earlier.

343
00:22:04,706 --> 00:22:07,707
Yeah, well, hopefully, this time,
you don't have to wait that long.

344
00:22:16,892 --> 00:22:20,294
Don't touch her.
I told you everything that I know!

345
00:22:20,295 --> 00:22:21,888
We will see.

346
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:29,429
On the line.

347
00:22:29,564 --> 00:22:31,998
No.

348
00:22:33,335 --> 00:22:37,770
Mia, no.

349
00:22:37,906 --> 00:22:41,107
Mi... mi... Mia!

350
00:22:49,084 --> 00:22:51,851
Ring the Bell.

351
00:22:53,021 --> 00:22:54,988
You have 60 seconds.

352
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:59,759
Begin.

353
00:23:39,734 --> 00:23:41,064
Time is up.

354
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:04,724
I needed to make sure
you weren't lying about the drive.

355
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:12,031
Got it. CCTV footage of
Mia and dad being taken

356
00:24:12,167 --> 00:24:14,067
into a warehouse on the east side of town.

357
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:16,803
Thank you, illegal Russian satellites.

358
00:24:16,938 --> 00:24:19,372
Great. Well, let's go save day.

359
00:24:22,777 --> 00:24:25,878
- Are you ok?
- I should've been able to do it.

360
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:31,584
- Oh, I should have enough slack now.
- To do what?

361
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,020
- Aah! Uh!
- What the hell?

362
00:24:34,155 --> 00:24:36,122
I can dislocate my thumbs.

363
00:24:36,257 --> 00:24:39,772
It's a useful technique
if getting tied to a chair

364
00:24:39,773 --> 00:24:40,830
is gonna become a habit.

365
00:24:40,831 --> 00:24:43,529
You have got to teach me how to do that.

366
00:24:58,197 --> 00:24:59,630
So you not ring Bell.

367
00:24:59,766 --> 00:25:04,402
Still, very impressive to, uh, not die.

368
00:25:04,537 --> 00:25:07,538
You shouldn't have told
them what was on the drive.

369
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:09,640
They would've killed you if I didn't.

370
00:25:09,776 --> 00:25:12,486
Or we would've been able
to escape without you

371
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:14,102
- giving up the information.
- Mia.

372
00:25:14,213 --> 00:25:16,917
Ok, can we please just
save the family squabbling

373
00:25:16,918 --> 00:25:18,349
till after we have the plans?

374
00:25:18,484 --> 00:25:20,351
Oleg's bound to figure out
how much they're worth.

375
00:25:20,486 --> 00:25:21,819
Well, he's smart businessman.

376
00:25:21,954 --> 00:25:23,997
He will figure out way to sell it.

377
00:25:23,999 --> 00:25:26,023
We need to figure out when
and where the sale is happening,

378
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,026
- and then we go recover the drive.
- Let me guess.

379
00:25:29,162 --> 00:25:31,829
Me and William get to
stay at the bar, right?

380
00:25:31,964 --> 00:25:35,766
You're going home, both of you.

381
00:25:35,902 --> 00:25:37,101
No.

382
00:25:37,252 --> 00:25:39,319
I have a feeling there's
less drama out here.

383
00:25:39,439 --> 00:25:41,672
Yeah.

384
00:25:46,579 --> 00:25:47,945
What do you mean, "no"?

385
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,980
I'm sorry, dad, but we just saved you

386
00:25:50,116 --> 00:25:51,916
from being murdered by
a bunch of gangsters.

387
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:53,150
I'm on team Mia here.

388
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:55,953
Yeah, but Mia just got
kidnapped by the Bratva.

389
00:25:56,088 --> 00:25:59,018
- So did you.
- I'm your father, all right?

390
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:04,012
It is my primary job in
the world to protect you.

391
00:26:04,013 --> 00:26:08,061
We don't need that. In the future,
we're the ones that are saving the city.

392
00:26:08,062 --> 00:26:10,034
Well, this isn't the future!

393
00:26:10,169 --> 00:26:15,673
This is months after
I was heartbroken right before I left...

394
00:26:15,808 --> 00:26:19,695
That I couldn't get you on the
phone at your grandparents'.

395
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:23,582
So I walked into your room
to look at you one last time,

396
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:26,217
and you looked back at me from your crib.

397
00:26:26,352 --> 00:26:28,419
And because you made the
choice to protect us,

398
00:26:28,521 --> 00:26:30,221
I had to spend my whole life alone.

399
00:26:30,356 --> 00:26:32,656
I didn't have a chance to
get to know my brother,

400
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:35,793
- to get to know you.
- I'm sorry that it worked out that way.

401
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:40,865
And both of you can decide
on your own how much...

402
00:26:41,015 --> 00:26:44,339
How much you want to hate me and
how much blame you want to assign.

403
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:48,114
But I made a promise to your
mother to keep you safe.

404
00:26:48,115 --> 00:26:51,942
And there... there is no world,
there is no universe, there's no past,

405
00:26:52,078 --> 00:26:55,246
present, or future where I break it.

406
00:26:55,381 --> 00:26:57,982
Fine.

407
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:13,397
You ready?

408
00:27:13,533 --> 00:27:15,332
As I'll ever be.

409
00:27:19,438 --> 00:27:21,205
Let's go!

410
00:27:26,379 --> 00:27:27,845
Must be some kind of tamper alarm.

411
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,481
- I'll get the payload.
- I'll keep watch.

412
00:27:43,729 --> 00:27:45,729
Hey, hey! Hey.

413
00:27:45,865 --> 00:27:48,399
Hey, Roy. Roy, look at me, man.

414
00:27:48,534 --> 00:27:49,833
Look at me!

415
00:27:49,969 --> 00:27:53,504
Roy, you're all right.

416
00:27:53,639 --> 00:27:57,441
- Y... you got it?
- Look. It's right here.

417
00:27:57,577 --> 00:27:59,743
Let's get the hell out of here.

418
00:28:03,482 --> 00:28:06,183
- Any word from your contact?
- Nyet.

419
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:08,052
Oh, these things take time.

420
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:12,523
I don't know about you,
but I could handle drink without umbrella.

421
00:28:12,658 --> 00:28:14,725
I'm good, thank you.

422
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:18,429
If by good, you mean...
How you say... moody,

423
00:28:18,564 --> 00:28:20,364
yes, you are.

424
00:28:20,499 --> 00:28:23,167
Is this because you ruin family vacation?

425
00:28:23,302 --> 00:28:25,369
I have to send them home
for their protection.

426
00:28:25,504 --> 00:28:28,038
Do you not think they can handle it?

427
00:28:28,174 --> 00:28:31,008
They can handle it. I just...

428
00:28:31,143 --> 00:28:33,777
I want to keep them away from the Bratva.

429
00:28:33,913 --> 00:28:36,780
You mean keep them away
from your Bratva past.

430
00:28:36,916 --> 00:28:38,616
Dark time for me.

431
00:28:38,751 --> 00:28:41,452
That is understandable.

432
00:28:41,587 --> 00:28:43,654
You are ashamed.

433
00:28:43,789 --> 00:28:46,624
You have truly done some terrible things.

434
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:48,626
Thank you for the reminder.

435
00:28:48,761 --> 00:28:51,729
But you also have done some good things.

436
00:28:51,831 --> 00:28:53,897
It's important that the kids see both.

437
00:28:54,033 --> 00:28:55,458
Right, but why would I want to share

438
00:28:55,460 --> 00:29:00,004
some of the worst mistakes of
my entire life with my children?

439
00:29:00,139 --> 00:29:03,007
That is the thing about teaching.

440
00:29:03,142 --> 00:29:09,546
It's not about what you want to say.
It's about what they need to hear.

441
00:29:09,682 --> 00:29:12,016
Remember first thing I taught you?

442
00:29:12,151 --> 00:29:13,917
Living is not for the weak.

443
00:29:14,053 --> 00:29:19,490
Your children are not weak, Oliver.
They're also not children.

444
00:29:19,625 --> 00:29:21,825
Whatever it is you have to say,

445
00:29:21,961 --> 00:29:24,595
they can handle it.

446
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:28,999
If you do not,
they will never learn to be heroes.

447
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:47,384
Oof. It would suck to be that door.

448
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:52,333
If you're here to give me
a pep talk or whatever, just don't.

449
00:29:52,334 --> 00:29:53,558
Don't flatter yourself.

450
00:29:53,593 --> 00:29:56,827
I just couldn't stand the smell
of that stale bar anymore.

451
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:59,863
It smells like cabbage.

452
00:29:59,999 --> 00:30:02,599
That's one more thing I
won't miss about this place.

453
00:30:02,735 --> 00:30:04,435
So you're actually going home.

454
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:07,771
Why wouldn't I?
Dad doesn't want me here.

455
00:30:07,907 --> 00:30:10,307
Oh, god. I can't stand pity parties.

456
00:30:10,443 --> 00:30:14,745
- Easy for you to say.
- And why is that?

457
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,848
You're the Black Canary.

458
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:21,351
All I've ever heard are stories
about how great you are.

459
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:25,856
In the future, you even save
me once like it was nothing.

460
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:28,425
Are you sure that's actually
me you're talking about?

461
00:30:28,527 --> 00:30:31,195
Ok, you can cut the false modesty.

462
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:34,164
Some people are cut out to be heroes,

463
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,934
others not so much.

464
00:30:37,069 --> 00:30:40,637
Is this really all because you
didn't ring some stupid Bell?

465
00:30:40,773 --> 00:30:43,073
Well, I couldn't save Zoe either.

466
00:30:47,713 --> 00:30:52,750
Every time I try and live up to my dad

467
00:30:52,885 --> 00:30:56,687
or to prove that I can
do what it is you all do,

468
00:30:56,822 --> 00:30:59,356
I... I fail.

469
00:30:59,492 --> 00:31:04,094
Do you think your father is any better?

470
00:31:05,431 --> 00:31:09,967
If you're trying to live up to us, don't.

471
00:31:10,102 --> 00:31:15,506
We are just as flawed as anyone,
especially me.

472
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:20,144
All you can do is live up to yourself.

473
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:21,945
What does that even mean?

474
00:31:22,081 --> 00:31:25,015
Are you really the type of
person that just gives up?

475
00:31:29,555 --> 00:31:33,423
Oh, good. Do we have time for
one more fight before we leave?

476
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:35,025
I'm not looking for a fight.

477
00:31:35,161 --> 00:31:36,426
Then stop trying to send us home.

478
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:37,628
We're not leaving.

479
00:31:37,763 --> 00:31:41,131
Good because I need your help.

480
00:31:42,368 --> 00:31:45,969
Oleg is selling drive
during bloodbath tonight.

481
00:31:46,105 --> 00:31:47,704
And how are we supposed to get in?

482
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:51,608
- They know our faces.
- Right. We use that to our advantage.

483
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:58,015
You and I are going in the
ring together as a team.

484
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:00,150
You would be helping us get in.

485
00:32:00,286 --> 00:32:02,953
Sorry. I did not have
time to get it dry cleaned.

486
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:05,856
I'm really more of a behind
the screen kind of guy,

487
00:32:05,991 --> 00:32:08,258
but wow. That is a nice suit. Huh.

488
00:32:08,394 --> 00:32:10,919
What exactly will
Anatoly and I be doing

489
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:14,164
while you two are playing
father/daughter fight club moment?

490
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:17,334
When Oleg realizes that it's
the two of us in the ring,

491
00:32:17,469 --> 00:32:18,735
that'll cause a distraction.

492
00:32:18,871 --> 00:32:21,738
You guys go and steal the drive.

493
00:32:21,881 --> 00:32:23,347
What do you say?

494
00:32:23,402 --> 00:32:27,444
Well, I'm in. Fancy rich guy
is the role I was born to play.

495
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:32,683
- You?
- Why the hell not?

496
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,587
Suit up.

497
00:32:53,357 --> 00:32:55,324
Now I see why they call it the bloodbath.

498
00:32:55,459 --> 00:32:56,120
You sure about this?

499
00:32:56,121 --> 00:32:59,222
Just get us in, please.

500
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:07,831
Not from you, American.

501
00:33:07,966 --> 00:33:13,937
Well, if it's not about money,
then how about stakes?

502
00:33:14,072 --> 00:33:18,107
- Has anyone survived 6 men before?
- Nyet.

503
00:33:18,243 --> 00:33:20,043
My guys will fight 6.

504
00:33:22,547 --> 00:33:24,347
You fight next.

505
00:33:25,483 --> 00:33:28,717
Do we really need to be
setting records tonight?

506
00:33:28,718 --> 00:33:32,222
You like a challenge, right?
Just please don't die.

507
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:39,462
- Anatoly, you guys set?
- Da. But no sign of high rollers.

508
00:33:39,598 --> 00:33:43,703
- Now is good time to strike.
- How much time do we have?

509
00:33:43,704 --> 00:33:46,402
Five minutes give or take.

510
00:33:47,575 --> 00:33:49,273
Well, this is gonna be fun.

511
00:33:49,274 --> 00:33:55,244
I've seen what you can do in there,
so just trust your instincts, ok? I do.

512
00:34:42,823 --> 00:34:45,123
Nyet...

513
00:34:58,272 --> 00:34:59,704
That's our cue.

514
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:01,880
Pakhan will still be protected.

515
00:35:01,971 --> 00:35:04,409
I'll deal with the muscle.

516
00:35:04,545 --> 00:35:06,545
You just watch my back.

517
00:35:52,526 --> 00:35:55,160
Tick-tock.
You guys have the plans yet?

518
00:35:59,967 --> 00:36:03,035
Don't move or I'll shoot.

519
00:36:08,508 --> 00:36:11,576
You said watch back.

520
00:36:16,016 --> 00:36:19,351
I got it. Let's move.

521
00:36:45,779 --> 00:36:48,213
I could actually get used to this.

522
00:36:56,924 --> 00:36:59,698
Congratulations.
Now you my favorite American.

523
00:36:59,724 --> 00:37:03,195
Hey, don't get too excited.
He has a lot of favorite Americans.

524
00:37:03,251 --> 00:37:04,115
Did you talk to John?

525
00:37:04,117 --> 00:37:08,005
I did. He got the plutonium
with an assist from Roy.

526
00:37:08,006 --> 00:37:09,840
All we have to do
is whip up an energy wave

527
00:37:09,841 --> 00:37:12,575
to destroy an all-knowing
space being. Easy.

528
00:37:12,711 --> 00:37:17,413
Before that, I would like to
propose a toast to Mia and William.

529
00:37:17,549 --> 00:37:19,682
Couldn't have done this without you.

530
00:37:19,818 --> 00:37:21,651
Vashe Zdorovie.

531
00:37:21,786 --> 00:37:23,820
Actually, here we say "Prochnost."

532
00:37:23,955 --> 00:37:28,391
- Prochnost?
- Prochnost. It means strength.

533
00:37:28,527 --> 00:37:31,327
It means a lot more than that.

534
00:37:31,463 --> 00:37:35,544
Um, would you mind giving me a
minute with these two, please?

535
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:36,315
- Yes.
- Sure.

536
00:37:36,316 --> 00:37:38,279
Ah. Leave the bottle.

537
00:37:41,893 --> 00:37:45,165
I know that I haven't really
spoken to the two of you

538
00:37:45,167 --> 00:37:47,834
about my time in Russia.

539
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:52,039
And that is because there were
some things that I did here

540
00:37:52,174 --> 00:37:53,941
that I'm not very proud of.

541
00:37:54,076 --> 00:37:58,946
As I'm coming to grips with the fact
that the two of you are grown up,

542
00:37:59,081 --> 00:38:00,380
I'm realizing that

543
00:38:00,516 --> 00:38:03,584
shielding you from the bad

544
00:38:03,719 --> 00:38:08,655
isn't going to do our
relationships any good.

545
00:38:08,791 --> 00:38:12,025
From this point forward,
whatever you want to know,

546
00:38:12,161 --> 00:38:16,730
whatever you might want to
ask me is fair game, ok?

547
00:38:17,948 --> 00:38:20,258
Like dislocating your thumbs?
'Cause I can't believe I missed that.

548
00:38:20,259 --> 00:38:22,159
Maybe something a little less painful.

549
00:38:22,294 --> 00:38:26,029
What about that island you were on?

550
00:38:26,165 --> 00:38:32,302
It's Lian Yu.
It's mandarin for "Purgatory."

551
00:38:33,672 --> 00:38:38,341
- You think that'll be enough?
- Yeah, well, this should do the trick.

552
00:38:40,946 --> 00:38:42,412
Roy, thanks for your help, man.

553
00:38:42,548 --> 00:38:46,183
It was good having you back,
even if it was just for one last mission.

554
00:38:46,318 --> 00:38:49,319
I think I'm gonna stick around for a while.

555
00:38:49,455 --> 00:38:51,555
If you're gonna be taking on a space god,

556
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:53,723
I figure you might need
all the help you can get.

557
00:38:53,859 --> 00:38:55,425
I'm glad you changed your mind.

558
00:38:55,561 --> 00:38:57,994
You know, when I first met Oliver,

559
00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:00,931
he gave me a purpose,

560
00:39:01,066 --> 00:39:03,567
but he also gave me all of you.

561
00:39:03,702 --> 00:39:07,804
It makes sense that having a team is
what helps me in the future, so why wait?

562
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:12,943
Besides, you know,
I kind of miss this place.

563
00:39:15,247 --> 00:39:19,549
Welcome back, Roy.

564
00:39:21,186 --> 00:39:24,754
Don't forget to send me that
picture of my dad with that haircut.

565
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:26,957
Don't forget to ask about Bratva tattoo.

566
00:39:27,092 --> 00:39:28,458
We have matching.

567
00:39:28,594 --> 00:39:30,126
Used to. Used to, actually.

568
00:39:30,295 --> 00:39:33,563
Oh, ho. I'm gonna need to
hear that story immediately.

569
00:39:35,634 --> 00:39:38,668
Thank you.
I always seem to end up in your debt.

570
00:39:38,804 --> 00:39:43,240
We are beyond keeping score. We have
been friends, we have been enemies.

571
00:39:43,375 --> 00:39:47,077
- From now on, let us just be brothers.
- Not the Bratva kind.

572
00:39:47,212 --> 00:39:51,515
No! Real family,
like the one you have now.

573
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:54,484
I can be the fun uncle.

574
00:39:55,821 --> 00:39:58,688
Being father really suits you.

575
00:39:58,824 --> 00:40:02,092
Good-bye, brother.

576
00:40:02,227 --> 00:40:04,361
Thank you. Good-bye, Oliver.

577
00:40:04,496 --> 00:40:06,329
All right. Let's go.

578
00:40:08,467 --> 00:40:12,202
Oh, Laurel, uh...
There's something I want to say.

579
00:40:12,337 --> 00:40:16,172
What? One last hilarious
Russian joke for the road?

580
00:40:16,308 --> 00:40:21,278
Sorry to doubt you.
I guess leopards really can change spots.

581
00:40:21,413 --> 00:40:24,414
Or in your case, bird, feather.

582
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:27,617
I thought you said you weren't sentimental.

583
00:40:27,753 --> 00:40:30,854
Maybe I change, too, like you.

584
00:40:41,099 --> 00:40:45,936
- Did you bring the plans?
- About that.

585
00:40:46,071 --> 00:40:50,415
I have decided not to join you
and your cosmic fashion tragedy

586
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:53,459
- that you're in cahoots with.
- Then you won't get your Earth back.

587
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:56,103
If saving it means going back
to the person that I used to be,

588
00:40:56,104 --> 00:40:58,848
then what the hell is the point?

589
00:40:58,984 --> 00:41:01,084
You really have changed.

590
00:41:01,219 --> 00:41:05,121
Look, I'm new to this whole
doing the right thing game,

591
00:41:05,257 --> 00:41:08,391
but you should really tell
your family the truth.

592
00:41:08,493 --> 00:41:10,026
Not yet.

593
00:41:10,162 --> 00:41:13,263
Then this is gonna be a little awkward.

594
00:41:20,205 --> 00:41:21,972
I didn't want to believe it.

595
00:41:22,107 --> 00:41:23,740
I'm sorry.

596
00:41:30,349 --> 00:41:32,682
Lyla, what... What have you done?

597
00:41:37,948 --> 00:41:42,120
