1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,920
<i>In 2166, an immortal tyrant
named Vandal Savage</i>

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,480
<i>conquered the world
and murdered my wife and child.</i>

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,200
<i>I have assembled an elite team
to hunt him throughout time</i>

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,680
<i>and stop his rise to power.</i>

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,200
<i>Unfortunately, my plan
is opposed by the body</i>

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,120
<i>I'd sworn my allegiance to,
the Time Masters.</i>

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,280
<i>In the future, my friends
may not be heroes,</i>

8
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,760
<i>but if we succeed,</i>

9
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,760
<i>they will be remembered as legends.</i>

10
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,720
<i>Previously,
on</i>Legends Of Tomorrow...

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,480
Hold on to something!

12
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,520
I want to marry you, Ray.

13
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,440
Tragedy or heartbreak,

14
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,680
that's how it always ends
if the man's not Carter.

15
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,400
It's Carter!

16
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,400
He doesn't even remember who he was.

17
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,160
Kendra, what are you waiting for?

18
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,520
If I kill Savage,
his mind will be lost.

19
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,800
<i>I'm so sorry, Rip.</i>

20
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,040
Who are you, Gareeb?

21
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,800
Ramses's men inform me
that you still refuse to speak,

22
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,520
to reveal your name
or why you tried to kill me.

23
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,040
Who are you?

24
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,960
The man who is trying
to save the world from you.

25
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,320
And how are your efforts proceeding?

26
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,920
You can't even stand
for lack of food and water.

27
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,480
I will always rise up against you.

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,360
I will never give up.

29
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,080
Soon the sky rocks
will lay waste to this kingdom,

30
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,680
and you along with it.

31
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,920
This cell will be your tomb.

32
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:53,360
What do you know of the future
that I don't, Gareeb?

33
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,640
Mission almost accomplished.

34
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,320
That bottle of Scotch was given to me
by Rob Roy MacGregor in 1689.

35
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,480
It's not half bad.

36
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,440
We should be toasting
to Savage's death.

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,720
Apart from celebrating murder,
Savage still has Carter brainwashed.

38
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,560
I don't know if you've been
paying attention, Professor,

39
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,240
but murdering Savage
was always the plan.

40
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,760
Besides, Carter reincarnates,

41
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,440
which is more than I can say
about us.

42
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,240
As long as he's on board
and breathing,

43
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,840
Savage is a threat
to everyone on this ship.

44
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,080
So what, we just kill Savage
and leave Carter a brainless drone?

45
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,680
Yes.

46
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,920
Sorry we're late,
but we found something.

47
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,720
We've been running diagnostics
on Ray's suit

48
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,440
after his battle with Savage's
Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robot.

49
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,480
The telemetry data included a
comparative scan of the robot's tech.

50
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,400
Amazing.
This neuromorphic profile

51
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,160
is astonishingly futuristic.

52
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,280
Yeah, it's from 2166.

53
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,080
Well, that's the thing. It's not.

54
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,840
This technology's light years
more advanced

55
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,160
than anything from 2166.

56
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,800
- Who cares?
- The Time Masters.

57
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,440
They refused to take
action against Savage

58
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,400
because he didn't pose
a threat to the timeline.

59
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,160
But if he comes into possession
of future technology...

60
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,720
It means he's been engaging in
exactly the same manipulation of time

61
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,920
that the Time Council
were designed to prevent.

62
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,240
So now they'll finally sign off on
undoing all the damage

63
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,440
Savage has done to the world.

64
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,840
Last time I checked, the Time Council
was at the edge of the timeline,

65
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,640
and this bucket of bolts
can barely hold it together as it is.

66
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,240
Gideon, what's the status
of the Time Drive?

67
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,320
<i>Stable, Captain.</i>

68
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,160
Plot a course
for the Vanishing Point.

69
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,400
Tonight, Vandal Savage
faces justice for his crimes.

70
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,520
{\an5}Quite the reversal of fortune,
isn't it, Gareeb?

71
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,680
{\an5}4,000 years ago it was you
who was the prisoner.

72
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,640
Ever since I met you again,

73
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,800
I've always wondered
how you managed to escape.

74
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,120
{\an5}Another time, perhaps.

75
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,760
{\an5}For the moment,
I'm more interested in this.

76
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,240
The brains
to your robot super-weapon.

77
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:02,280
At least a century more advanced
than anything to be found in 2166.

78
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,760
Do you have something to ask me?

79
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,600
{\an5}How did you obtain the ability
to travel through time?

80
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,560
From you.

81
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,680
{\an5}When I saw you again in 1975,

82
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,360
{\an5}I realized that time travel
was the only explanation.

83
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,360
You showed a caveman fire.

84
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,640
And I had almost 200 years

85
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,800
to figure out
how to strike the flame.

86
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,040
{\an5}All this time, I've been wondering
why it was so difficult

87
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,920
{\an5}to locate you throughout history.

88
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,400
{\an5}Because you've been
moving through history.

89
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,600
Well, you'll come to learn

90
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,320
{\an5}that this is just one of many things
we have in common, Gareeb.

91
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,520
{\an5}We're both doing
what we must to save the world.

92
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,160
Subjugating the world
to your rule is not saving it.

93
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,560
{\an5}You would create a wasteland
and call it peace.

94
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,000
{\an5}Do not misquote Tacitus to me.

95
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,120
I knew him well.

96
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,880
{\an5}I have lived long enough
to watch civilizations rise and fall.

97
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,080
{\an5}You weep for your son.

98
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:11,040
{\an5}I have held dozens of my children
as they perished from old age.

99
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,320
You might be a Time Master,...

100
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,200
but I'm a master of time.

101
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,560
And I play a far deeper game

102
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,440
than you could ever hope
to comprehend.

103
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,800
{\an5}Gideon, go to maximum
on the Time Drive.

104
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,320
{\an5}<i>Inadvisable, Captain.
When Dr. Palmer siphoned power</i>

105
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,880
{\an5}<i>from the auxiliary Time Drive,
he reduced the ship...</i>

106
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,520
{\an5}Gideon! Take us to maximum.

107
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,560
{\an5}We need to get to the Vanishing Point
as fast as possible.

108
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,000
Where am I?

109
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,080
Somewhere safe.

110
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,920
Safe as long as those cuffs hold.

111
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,520
{\an5}Do you know who you are?

112
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:51,080
{\an5}I'm Scythian Torvil,
adjunct to Lord Savage.

113
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,080
{\an5}And you will release me,
or I will kill you where you stand.

114
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,280
Your name is Carter Hall.

115
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,840
{\an5}You used to be Prince Khufu
of the Middle Kingdom.

116
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,840
{\an5}- And I am...
- Kendra Saunders.

117
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,000
{\an5}Oh, you seem surprised.

118
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,720
{\an5}You didn't think Lord Savage
would warn me of my enemies?

119
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,680
{\an5}Let me go and I promise you
I will show mercy.

120
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,560
{\an5}I will kill you without
making you suffer first.

121
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,240
{\an5}Not to sound like a six-year-old,
but are we there yet?

122
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,600
No, the Waverider was severely
damaged in Savage's last attack.

123
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,720
{\an5}Yeah, I can tell by the way
she's flying.

124
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,520
{\an5}You sure you're not
pushing her too hard?

125
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,960
The longer Savage
is on board the ship,

126
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,600
the greater the danger to all of us.

127
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,240
To us, or your family?

128
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,840
I checked with Gideon.

129
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,680
Bringing Savage onboard
didn't change the timeline,

130
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,680
and your family still dies.

131
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,360
The timeline is always in flux.

132
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,440
Once we get to the Vanishing Point,
all will be well.

133
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,160
Is that why you're pushing
the ship beyond its limits?

134
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,960
This has been my ship
for the last 13 years.

135
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,000
No one knows its limits
better than I do.

136
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,080
Not even Gideon.

137
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,920
The Waverider will hold together.
I promise you.

138
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,560
Bollocks. Gideon!

139
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,040
<i>Time Drive failure, Captain.
The mains are offline.</i>

140
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,760
- What happened?
- It appears the Time Drive

141
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,200
is in need of some repair.

142
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,200
Miss Lance,
if you wouldn't mind going,

143
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,960
- checking on our guest?
- On it.

144
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,440
Mr. Jackson. I'm going to need your
assistance in fixing the Time Drive.

145
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,320
What if Jefferson
can't get the ship moving again?

146
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,520
Oh, thanks for the vote
of confidence.

147
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,320
No, what I mean is
if the ship can't be repaired,

148
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,760
we're marooned in the Time Stream.

149
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,400
There really is no need to worry.

150
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,720
The Jumpship is equipped
with an auxiliary Time Drive,

151
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,520
capable of a one-time jump
back to 2016.

152
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,360
Which will not be necessary,

153
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,160
considering you are going to
fix the Waverider.

154
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,280
- I'll do my best.
- That's the spirit.

155
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,560
You look concerned, Martin.

156
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,480
I'm remembering
what Mr. Snart said about

157
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,280
Savage's presence on this ship
being a danger to us all.

158
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,200
Have you spoken
with your sister Laurel lately?

159
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,600
How do you know so much
about us?

160
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,640
Oh, I've only had 191 years
to research my enemies.

161
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,840
Well, then you'd know
I don't scare that easily.

162
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,080
You should be scared...

163
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,320
of Captain Hunter.

164
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,400
His obsession to save his family
will be the death of you all.

165
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,560
Thanks for the tip.
Enjoy being incarcerated.

166
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,120
Captain Hunter lied to you so often,

167
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,880
and still you persist
in believing him.

168
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,040
You do know why he selected
all of you

169
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,600
for this endeavor, don't you?

170
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,440
Great bone structure?

171
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:49,600
He chose people he could manipulate,
people that would believe his lies.

172
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,840
Well, the lies I don't believe
are yours.

173
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,960
Do you blame him for putting
his family's lives first?

174
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,040
I'd tell you to go to hell,

175
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,640
but you'd probably
just feel at home there.

176
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,840
<i>Okay, I've got eyes
on the Time Drive.</i>

177
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,720
<i>There seems to be
a large crack in it.</i>

178
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,840
Well, if the housing's intact,
we should be all right.

179
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,680
I am going to need you
to re-route the power

180
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,880
from the secondary manifold.

181
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,240
<i>Okay. I'm on it.</i>

182
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,160
Gideon, what is the level
of contamination in the engine room?

183
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,400
<i>Levels at three percent
above maximum, Captain.</i>

184
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,320
- We have to get him out of there.
- Don't worry.

185
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,880
He should be able to finish
before the radiation

186
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,280
has any adverse effect.

187
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,800
<i>Jefferson?</i>

188
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,880
Mom?
What are you doing here?

189
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:51,120
Good question. I'm supposed to be
meeting my son at Jitters.

190
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,200
But clearly he misses his
old job more than his mother.

191
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,160
I am so sorry.
I must've lost track of time.

192
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,320
Well, this should help.

193
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,040
I know it's not much,
but it belonged to your father.

194
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,200
At least it was going to.

195
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,280
I bought it for him
as a birthday present

196
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,200
before he passed.

197
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,800
It's awesome. Thanks.

198
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,160
Maybe you can use it tonight.

199
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,200
Dinner at your Grandma Louise's.

200
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,160
Yes. I will be there.

201
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,600
And I won't be late.

202
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,480
I just got to stop
by the university first.

203
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,960
The university?

204
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,120
I got to say good bye to a friend
who's leaving town.

205
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,320
- But I will be there.
- 6.00.

206
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,320
- Okay. All right, I love you.
- I love you too, baby.

207
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,400
<i>Jefferson?</i>

208
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,040
Jefferson?

209
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,840
I did it. I got it working.

210
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,040
You said he wouldn't be harmed.

211
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,320
It must be the surge when he brought
the Time Drive back online.

212
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,960
- Gideon?
<i>- Mr. Jackson has suffered</i>

213
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,200
<i>an extreme amount
of temporal radiation exposure.</i>

214
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,560
- That sounds ominous.
<i>- Oh, it is.</i>

215
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,480
<i>And there's nothing I can do
to reverse the side effects.</i>

216
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,640
What side effects?

217
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,880
<i>Mr. Jackson's internal organs
are aging at an accelerated rate.</i>

218
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,520
<i>The rest of his body
will soon follow.</i>

219
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,600
Why are all the snacks
in the future sugar-free?

220
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,880
So much for progress.

221
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,320
You remember Alexa?

222
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,800
Yeah. From the security deposit job.
What about it?

223
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:14,440
Just had a feeling about that one,
a sixth sense things would end badly.

224
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,840
And they would have, if you hadn't
have pulled us out of there.

225
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,720
- So what?
- I'm getting the same feeling now.

226
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,840
Gideon, how effective were
Mr. Jackson's attempts

227
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,480
to bring the Time Drive back online?

228
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,040
<i>The drive's functions
have been restored,</i>

229
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,360
<i>but the entire system
will require a master reboot</i>

230
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,280
<i>before we can continue on
to the Vanishing Point.</i>

231
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,680
Yes, please begin.

232
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,960
And in the meantime,
could you check the timeline

233
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,400
for any variations
in my family's future?

234
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,280
<i>I believe Miss Lance
already told you the results.</i>

235
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,360
Please.

236
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,760
<i>The timeline remains unchanged.</i>

237
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,680
Were you expecting
something different?

238
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,240
Hope springs eternal, Miss Lance.

239
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,920
If it didn't, I would've surrendered
to despair a long time ago.

240
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,480
I assume Mr. Savage
is still secure in his cell?

241
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,800
He wasn't exactly short
on opinions on you, though.

242
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,880
I'd imagine not.

243
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,520
Among them being
that you would sell us out

244
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,760
to save your family.

245
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,440
He's not wrong.

246
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,120
Mr. Jackson is currently
in the med bay

247
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,800
facing death due
to temporal radiation exposure.

248
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,760
- Wait, what?
- I sent him to fix the Time Drive.

249
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,320
I could have gone myself.
And I'm left to wonder if...

250
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,480
in some way,
I did it because of the risk.

251
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,640
So you sent Jax on a suicide mission

252
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,520
so that you could stay alive
to save your family?

253
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,800
I don't know, Sara.

254
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,360
That's what vexes me.

255
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,600
You know what vexes me?

256
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,840
Thinking that we've thrown
in with a captain

257
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,520
who cares more about himself
than he does his crew.

258
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,920
<i>Kendra, are you sure about this?</i>

259
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,320
Do you remember him?

260
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,440
He was our son.

261
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,480
Aldus.

262
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,320
Do you really
expect me to believe that?

263
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,200
I expect you to remember
your feelings.

264
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,760
We were together.

265
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,040
And we were happy.

266
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,760
We were a family.

267
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,240
Kendra, stay back!

268
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,120
Oops.

269
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,160
Are you okay?

270
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,200
- I should've known better.
- But are you okay?

271
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,880
Yeah, I'm fine.

272
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,880
Stay away from him.
I'll be right back.

273
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,440
- Where are you going?
- To end this.

274
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,880
Dr. Palmer. To what do I owe
the pleasure of this visit?

275
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,160
You're gonna tell me
how to free Carter's mind.

276
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,000
Well, all you had to do was ask.

277
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,040
Are you sure you want me to?

278
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,880
Of course I'm sure.

279
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,640
Because the moment I release him,

280
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,120
you will lose her forever.

281
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,120
You don't know Kendra.

282
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,240
I know Chay-Ara.

283
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,760
And I know the man who stands
between you and your love

284
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,200
has stood between me and mine
for millennia.

285
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,200
We're actually quite alike,
you and I.

286
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,840
We're nothing alike.

287
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,520
You're insane.

288
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,600
But yet Chay-Ara once loved me
as she professes to love you.

289
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,760
Oh, you didn't know that, did you?

290
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,000
I don't even think
Chay-Ara remembers,

291
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,600
but 4,000 years ago

292
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,160
I discovered that my Chay-Ara
had been reborn

293
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,120
but with no memory
of what had happened.

294
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,160
- Like you murdering her and Carter.
- True.

295
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,440
She had no recollection of my...

296
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,520
my crime of passion.

297
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,120
And she fell in love with me...

298
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,280
very deeply.

299
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,680
And I with her.

300
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,200
That is perverse.

301
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,840
No, that is fact.

302
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,960
That is history.

303
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,760
And we were happy,
Dr. Palmer, very happy.

304
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:28,000
None of us blinded by our cursed past

305
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,040
until he came.

306
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,120
He took her away from me.
He poisoned her against me.

307
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:38,480
He stole the happiness
that we shared, Dr. Palmer.

308
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,360
No.

309
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,880
No. Carter is a good man.

310
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,240
And you are my only enemy.

311
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,680
Am I?

312
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,320
Or am I just a man
experiencing the same things

313
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,240
as you are right now?

314
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,440
We have the same enemy.

315
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,760
If Carter's free, you lose her.

316
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,560
But then she would hardly be
the first woman you've lost,

317
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,640
now, would she?

318
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,160
I am really gonna have to beef
up our security around here.

319
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,120
It was pretty easy
to bypass the system,

320
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,560
considering I designed it.

321
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,080
You like my ride?

322
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,040
- Those are some pretty hot wheels.
- Yeah.

323
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,120
Maybe that's your new name.

324
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,040
- How you feeling?
- I'm okay.

325
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,320
- What are you doing here?
- I came to drop off a note.

326
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:42,040
Let me guess. It says,
"Hey, Felicity. I hope you're well.

327
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,760
I'm off to travel through time
and fight an immortal bad guy."

328
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,880
- Is that me?
- Yeah.

329
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,960
- That was pretty good.
- Thank you.

330
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,360
So, obviously, Oliver told you.

331
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,640
Don't let his broodiness fool you.
He can be quite chatty sometimes.

332
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,320
He also happened to mention that
you're going on this suicide mission

333
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,840
because you think
there's nothing for you here.

334
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,400
You think it's a suicide mission?

335
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,400
I don't think going after
Vandal Savage is a vacation.

336
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,080
But don't change the subject.
You have a life here, Ray.

337
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,200
Actually, everybody thinks I'm dead.

338
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,120
Nothing puts things in perspective

339
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,720
more than seeing yourself
become a ghost.

340
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,800
You're not a ghost.

341
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,960
You just need to come back
to the world.

342
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,320
And I will, after we take out Savage.

343
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,040
I became the Atom to make
the world a better place.

344
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,360
And I'm pretty sure
that saving it counts.

345
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,480
I'm pretty sure it does too.

346
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,360
See you soon.

347
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,360
You know, I would've stayed for you.

348
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,320
I do. But who knows?

349
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,200
Maybe the future Mrs. Palmer is out
there somewhere in the past,

350
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,240
the future, some parallel universe.

351
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,440
I'm off to save the world...

352
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,480
not fall in love.

353
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,560
"And though my soul departs
the Earth,

354
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,840
I count the days till my rebirth.

355
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,200
I will wait across eternity

356
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,000
for my love to come back to me."

357
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,800
Please.

358
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,320
Come back.

359
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,280
Ray?

360
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,920
Ray...

361
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,600
Ray?

362
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,680
Ray, stop!

363
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,800
Please.
Just give me a chance to explain.

364
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,480
- What you saw back there, it was...
- What? Wasn't what it looked like?

365
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,800
You were reciting a love poem
to your brainwashed ex-boyfriend.

366
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,040
I am just trying to help Carter
remember who he really is.

367
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,720
Your soul mate.

368
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,240
Yeah, that's the part
in the conversation

369
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,160
where you're supposed to say,
"No, Ray, you're my soul mate."

370
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,040
Ray, you know that I love you.

371
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,880
I know.

372
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,720
It's just not enough.

373
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,760
I can't believe I'm saying it,
but Savage was right.

374
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,840
Loving you is like a curse.

375
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,880
Oh, Ray.

376
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,600
You have to know, whatever he said,

377
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,640
he's just trying to get inside
your head.

378
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,280
I know that.

379
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,040
But he's right.

380
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,520
Kendra, I don't think
I can do this anymore.

381
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,880
What are you saying?

382
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,240
Oh, what?
You want to end things?

383
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,360
Unless you can tell me
that I'll ever be anything more

384
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,800
than just Carter's placeholder.

385
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,440
Ray.

386
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,520
Are you certain
these results are accurate?

387
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,800
Jefferson's blood chemistry
is akin to that of a...

388
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,280
<i>A 63-year-old man.</i>

389
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,160
Actually, I don't feel a day over 60.

390
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,000
This isn't funny.
No, and it's all Rip's fault.

391
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,680
<i>I'm afraid he's also suffering
from early-stage osteoarthritis.</i>

392
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,520
The exposure to the temporal
radiation

393
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,800
has led to an accelerated rate
of intracellular degeneration.

394
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,800
This is what happens
when Rip goes with Plan B.

395
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,760
Plan A being taking Savage's
head in with that mace.

396
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,360
We're endeavoring to resolve
this without bloodshed.

397
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,000
And how's that working out
for you, Gandhi?

398
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,880
Look, there's nothing
we can do about it now.

399
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,240
We can talk to Hunter.

400
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,640
Even if Kendra was to kill Savage,

401
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,560
my situation's still the same.

402
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,000
We're talking about our situation,
Pops.

403
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,560
We're not waiting around
for the other shoe to drop.

404
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,920
You deserve better.

405
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,320
- Alexa?
- You bet your ass.

406
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,640
- We need to talk.
- We saw what you did to Jax.

407
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,080
And we're worried
it's just the beginning.

408
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,320
- The beginning of what?
- It's like I said, Rip.

409
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,240
As long as Savage is alive
and on this ship,

410
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,720
he is dangerous.

411
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,920
The Time Drive is rebooting.
We will soon be on our way.

412
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,040
I'm asking for a little faith,
gentlemen.

413
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,760
Sorry, fresh out.

414
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,280
I take it you and Mr. Snart
are of the same mind?

415
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,360
Yes.

416
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,320
And what of you, Miss Lance?

417
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,520
You're the one who said
you'd sell us out for your family.

418
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,840
Well, if that's how you all feel,
none of you is obliged

419
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,320
to continue on this voyage with me.

420
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,960
As I told Martin, the Jumpship

421
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,760
can make a one-time voyage
back to 2016.

422
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,080
Are you saying it's ours?

423
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,560
I'm saying that this mission

424
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,400
has always been
a voluntary enterprise.

425
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,600
And the mission was to kill Savage.

426
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,880
Which doesn't seem
to be on the table anymore.

427
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,200
Very well.
Leave, if that's what you...

428
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,640
It's been a blast, Rip.

429
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,280
Good luck getting
to the Vanishing Point.

430
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,240
Tell your pals Chronos says,
"Kiss my ass."

431
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,560
What about you, Sara?

432
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,480
Never been one to run from a fight.

433
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,280
Hi.

434
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,040
Impossible.

435
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,160
When I saw you last...

436
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I know.

437
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,840
A miracle...

438
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,240
when I thought there were
none left to be had.

439
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,720
I needed to see you.

440
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,160
Look, I don't know how,
but I'm gonna get you out of here.

441
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,080
This isn't your fight anymore,
Ta-er al-Sahfer.

442
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,560
I'm not gonna let you rot here.

443
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,480
Not when you're in here
because of me.

444
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,680
I am in here because of my choices,
beloved.

445
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,200
I made them
ready to accept my punishment.

446
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,920
I won't leave you in here.

447
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,520
If you love me, you will.

448
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,720
If you love me, you will leave
this place far behind,

449
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,400
and live a life unburdened
by your past.

450
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,120
It's easier said than done.

451
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,200
Anything worth doing always is.

452
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,040
Well, finally an intellect
approximate to my own.

453
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,000
My imprisonment was starting
to get dreary, Professor.

454
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,840
I'm not here
to play mind games with you.

455
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,160
I'm here to ask you
if you remember a night

456
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,680
in October, 1975,

457
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,320
a place called the Greyhill Building.

458
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,680
That night, you and your acolytes...

459
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,360
Were celebrating the acquisition

460
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,600
- of your friend Carter Hall's body.
- Yes.

461
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,400
It's my understanding
this ritual involved

462
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,800
you sharing your immortality
with your followers.

463
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:15,120
And you wish for me to do
the same for someone else.

464
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,280
Someone dear to you.

465
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,520
Your nuclear counterpart,
perhaps?

466
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,840
Yes.

467
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,120
And as impertinent
as this may sound,

468
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,920
I need your help.

469
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,800
Well, clearly, your friends

470
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,560
didn't give you
the full account of the ritual.

471
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,120
You see, it was Carter's blood
that worked the magic.

472
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,720
Perhaps you should talk to him.

473
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,080
Or better yet, Dr. Palmer.

474
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,080
I'm sure that he would be
more than happy

475
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,440
to help you spill some.

476
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,600
And I'm certain
you would enjoy that.

477
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,520
Pitting me and Raymond
against Carter, against Kendra.

478
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,720
Having all of us
at each other's throats

479
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,880
while being stranded
in the Time Stream.

480
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,280
But...

481
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,640
we're not stranded.
Not entirely.

482
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,400
Thank you, Mr. Savage.

483
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,320
As I'd hoped, you've provided me
with a solution to my problem.

484
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,920
I don't get it, Grey.

485
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,160
What's in here that's gonna fix me?

486
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,160
Well, nothing inside the Jumpship,
Jefferson

487
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,960
but rather the craft itself.

488
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,560
You see, this ship is pre-programmed
to return to 2016.

489
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,600
I've made some additional adjustments

490
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:31,440
according to the theory
of quantum-retro causality,

491
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,800
and if my math is correct,
the trip through the Time Stream

492
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,920
should reverse your condition.

493
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,320
No... no.

494
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,320
I'm not leaving you or the team.

495
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,040
Which is why
I'm not giving you a choice.

496
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,160
What did you do?

497
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,840
I've administered a mild sedative.

498
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,520
You roofied me again?

499
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,280
When I tricked you
onto this ship the first time,

500
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,200
I was only thinking of myself.

501
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,160
Now I'm thinking of you.

502
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,920
You can't do this!

503
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,200
If we're separated, you'll die!

504
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,280
I've already lived my life,
Jefferson.

505
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,400
Now you must live yours.
Give my love to Clarissa.

506
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,080
Tell her I'm sorry.

507
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,480
She deserved
a proper good bye.

508
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,960
Grey! Grey, no!

509
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,040
No!

510
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,280
- Knock, knock.
- Oh, hello.

511
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,320
I hope you don't mind,
but I thought I'd see

512
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,760
if I could interest you
in a lunch date.

513
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,240
Oh, my darling.
I'm right in the middle

514
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,360
of some research
that simply cannot wait.

515
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,600
What's the topic?

516
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:55,680
As a matter of fact, time itself.
The irony.

517
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,440
Oh! Damn, I completely forgot.

518
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,480
I promised I'd meet
with some fellow academics

519
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,600
to help resolve
an experiment of theirs.

520
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,440
Does this experiment have anything
to do with time travel?

521
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,800
Almost certainly.

522
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,640
But it won't take long.

523
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,920
In fact, I'll be home
before you even know it.

524
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,080
Clarissa?

525
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,040
You, you know that I love you.

526
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,960
There's nothing I do
that isn't driven

527
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,640
by that very thought.

528
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,360
Now let's get the hell out of here.

529
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,360
- What'd you do, Poindexter?
- What do you mean?

530
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,440
The Jumpship. Where is it?

531
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,520
Well, it's really more a question
of when.

532
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,160
But, oh, yes.

533
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,720
You both wanted to return to 2016.

534
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,000
Got it in one.

535
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,560
I did what I had to do
to save Jefferson's life.

536
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,120
Now we must do whatever's necessary
to repair the Waverider

537
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,200
and deliver Savage
to the Vanishing Point.

538
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,960
Oh, back so soon with the stench
of defeat written all over you.

539
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,040
Can't say I didn't warn you.

540
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,200
Trying to get under my skin?
Is that it?

541
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,320
Got your little game figured out.

542
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,480
For all your intelligence,

543
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:18,280
you still didn't manage
to make Chay-Ara yours.

544
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,640
I wouldn't expect a psychopath
like you to understand.

545
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,600
Kendra is free to do what she wants.

546
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,320
You know what I see
when I look at you?

547
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,880
I see weakness
masquerading as goodness.

548
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,240
I'm not the one trapped in a cage.

549
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,120
Well, if it weren't for this cage,

550
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,120
you wouldn't have
that arrogant look on your face.

551
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,800
- You think I'm afraid of you?
- No.

552
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,960
I know you are.

553
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,800
At least Carter had the courage
to face me like a man.

554
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,080
No wonder she didn't choose you.

555
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,480
Oh...

556
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,600
You feel better now, Dr. Palmer?

557
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,680
Not even close.

558
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,880
And I thought
you were nothing like me.

559
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,680
I'll leave you
to contemplate on that.

560
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,640
<i>Time Drive reinitialization
complete, Captain.</i>

561
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,120
<i>The primary systems
are back online and stable.</i>

562
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,200
Begin ignition sequence
and resume our route

563
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,320
to the Vanishing Point.

564
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,000
You're a fool, Professor.

565
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,080
I'm trying to save Jefferson's life.

566
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,000
Savage has escaped.

567
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,120
- What?
- I'm sorry.

568
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,600
Pull up all the surveillance
monitors, now!

569
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,280
<i>I'm afraid Vandal Savage
has already freed Carter Hall,</i>

570
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,760
<i>and is preparing to disengage...</i>

571
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,480
That can't be good.

572
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,680
Gideon's entire
operational matrix is offline.

573
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,760
And without her help...

574
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,360
We'll have to make our
approach the old-fashioned way.

575
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,960
Shouldn't we be
more worried about Savage

576
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,480
and his brainwashed crony?

577
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,000
Yes. Which is why I need you
and Dr. Palmer

578
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,240
to go and recapture him.

579
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,360
In the meantime, if the rest
of us can't figure out

580
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,720
how to pilot the ship without Gideon,

581
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,600
we're never gonna be able
to leave the Time Stream.

582
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,920
If we live through this,
you bumbling idiot,

583
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,440
I might just kill you.

584
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,640
Exactly how old-fashioned
are you talking?

585
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,480
So, if the Time Stream
is like this vast river,

586
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:55,040
these maps plot the safest course
along that river's path.

587
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,960
Exactly. I keep these here
just in case of emergency.

588
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,960
Well, this certainly qualifies.
What's Jurgens Ridge?

589
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,680
Pray you need never find out.

590
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,080
Martin, you're gonna be our engineer.

591
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,800
I need you to adjust
our energy output

592
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,560
to avoid over-taxing
the Waverider.

593
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,480
And you, Miss Lance,
you're gonna be our navigator.

594
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,400
I was League of Assassins,
not NASA.

595
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,760
I need someone
who can make tough calls

596
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,040
under extreme pressure.

597
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,080
No one fits that description
better than you.

598
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,640
Come to join the party?

599
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,520
You should've left me back in 2166!

600
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,560
Yeah, yeah,
we know that, mullethead.

601
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,880
Who are you to stand up against me,

602
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,960
Vandal Savage, destroyer of empires?

603
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,760
Leonard Snart, robber of ATMs!

604
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,960
We need more power
to the Time Drive, Martin.

605
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,480
How much further can we push it?

606
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,680
25 percent,
and only for a brief burst.

607
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,920
But it might be all we need.

608
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,680
It's still two against four.

609
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,760
Come on!

610
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,640
What's our trajectory
looking like, Miss Lance?

611
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,200
Just give me a second here.

612
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,840
Well, oddly enough,
as the Vanishing Point

613
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,160
is at the very end of time.

614
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,360
Yeah, and we're never gonna
make it there

615
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,280
if you don't lower the ship
negative 12 degrees on my mark.

616
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,440
Three, two, one, now!

617
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:29,080
- Did it work?
- Well, we're not dead.

618
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,720
I got this. Handle Savage.

619
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:40,640
Haircut! Move your fat head
so I can get a clean shot!

620
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,880
- They seem to be getting closer.
- I'll go help them.

621
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,720
No! I'm not gonna place another one
of you in jeopardy, I'll go.

622
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,960
But who's gonna pilot the ship?

623
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,960
Gareeb, I was wondering
where you were hiding.

624
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,320
Bring her to me.

625
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,000
Chay-Ara, my love.

626
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,000
I'm sorry that it has to end
like this again.

627
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,560
Carter.

628
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,360
I will wait for eternity.

629
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,680
Come back to me.

630
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,720
Kendra...

631
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,040
He's alive.

632
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,040
You saved him.

633
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,320
You saved us all.

634
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,520
- Is that...
- Welcome to the Vanishing Point.

635
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,680
I can't believe we made it.

636
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,360
And what did you do
to your shoulder?

637
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,960
Oh, I might have jumped
in front of a laser blast

638
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,200
intended for Miss Saunders.

639
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,160
What?
I couldn't have my team thinking

640
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,360
I cared more about myself
than them, now, could I?

641
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,440
Really?

642
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,760
I think I just lost control
of the ship.

643
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,080
Yeah, that might have
something to do with us

644
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,280
being the most wanted time criminals
in all of history.

645
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,840
<i>Timeship Waverider,</i>

646
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,880
<i>we've taken control
of your guidance systems.</i>

647
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,480
<i>Disable your weapons
and prepare to be boarded.</i>

648
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,040
- Oh, it's good to be home.
<i>- Captain Hunter.</i>

649
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,480
<i>This is unexpected.</i>

650
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,040
Well, I have a reputation
to maintain, don't I?

651
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,120
And I hereby request
an immediate assembly

652
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,880
of the Time Council in accordance
with General Order 52.

653
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,160
<i>So you've returned
to answer for your crimes?</i>

654
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,440
No. I'm here to justify them.

655
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,360
If this truly is good bye,

656
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,560
would you mind answering
just one final question?

657
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,040
Well, it seems only sporting.

658
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:54,560
How did you manage to escape
my prison all those years ago?

659
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:57,280
There were no signs of damage,

660
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,320
no clues to your tricks.

661
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,640
It left me puzzled for centuries.

662
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,960
The best magic tricks
have the simplest solutions.

663
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,160
I bribed your guard
with a novelty pen.

664
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,880
Had a picture of a woman on it.

665
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,400
Turn it upside down,
her top comes off.

666
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,560
I won it from a drunk GI
in a Philippines bar in 1944.

667
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,360
It's a tacky souvenir,

668
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,000
but in this case, a lifesaver.

669
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,200
Now, unfortunate for you,

670
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,760
the guards at the Vanishing Point
won't be quite so easily swayed.

671
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,720
- Hey.
- Hey.

672
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,840
I was making sure that he was okay.

673
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,680
I think most guys would be
more inclined

674
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,560
to smother him with a pillow.

675
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,680
Just because he stole my girl
and tried to take over the ship?

676
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,480
But seriously,
Carter saved your life.

677
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,080
He's a part of this team.
Always has been.

678
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:55,640
- I wish things could be different.
- Yeah, me too.

679
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,320
I need you to know
that what we had was real.

680
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,080
In a way...

681
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,240
a broken heart is
just what the doctor ordered.

682
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,920
- It is?
- Yeah.

683
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,800
When I lost Anna, I thought that...

684
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,680
I could never find anybody

685
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,280
who I could spend
the rest of my life with.

686
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,920
You proved me wrong.

687
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:23,200
Thank you for showing me
that it's possible.

688
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,600
Rip Hunter,

689
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,920
on behalf of the Time Council,
you are hereby ordered...

690
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,240
Yeah, before you do that,
there's someone I'd like you to meet.

691
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,760
You remember Mr. Savage?

692
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,320
Of course.
And we remember how you pled

693
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,680
for us to remove him
from the timeline once before.

694
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,520
Well, as the first Time Master
was so fond of saying,

695
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,480
that was then, this is now.

696
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:04,080
Incontrovertible proof
that Vandal Savage

697
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,680
has been engaged
in the manipulation of time!

698
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,080
Including a confession.

699
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,920
<i>When I saw you again in 1975,</i>

700
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,280
<i>I realized that time travel
was the only explanation.</i>

701
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:18,680
<i>You showed a caveman fire,
and I had almost 200 years</i>

702
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,640
<i>to figure out
how to strike the flame.</i>

703
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,440
Impressive, Captain Hunter.

704
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,920
You and your team
have accomplished

705
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,520
what none of us here

706
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,320
in the Time Council
believed you would.

707
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,800
If the prisoner
would step forward...

708
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,320
Vandal Savage,
by the power of this chamber,

709
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:45,400
it is my duty to return you
to Earth immediately.

710
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,400
What?

711
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,320
This man you've brought
before us

712
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,720
is needed back in 2166.

713
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,240
You're in league with him.

714
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,400
I wouldn't expect you
to understand our reasons.

715
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,920
For all your wisdom,
you were never able to take

716
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,160
the long view of history.

717
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,280
Take him away.

718
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,440
Search their ship for the others.

719
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,760
- Did you hear that?
- Don't try to distract me.

720
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,000
We need to find somewhere to hide.

721
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,080
Why do we need
to find somewhere to hide?

722
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,760
Alexa.

723
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,840
Damn.

724
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,000
If you're here for Savage,
you're too late.

725
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,880
- Mick, what's going on?
- You're under arrest.

726
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,720
If I had a nickel
for every time I heard that.

727
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,640
Druce's men have taken your ship.

728
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,760
Your friends are under arrest.

729
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:09,200
And you are once again
my prisoner.

730
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,560
This time, I don't plan to lose you.

731
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:17,400
Oh, and yes, I do remember
the guard very well.

732
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,480
He died.

733
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,560
Now, if you would excuse me,

734
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:24,200
I'd better be getting back to 2166.

735
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:28,400
I've been waiting so very long
to meet your family.

736
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,160
Wouldn't miss it for the world.

737
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:34,000
No! No!

738
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,040
No!
