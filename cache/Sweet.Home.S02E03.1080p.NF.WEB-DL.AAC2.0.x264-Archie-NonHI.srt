KIM SU-YEONG

2
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:37,078
From here on, we'll go by foot.

3
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:01,394
Yeong-su, hey.

4
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:03,855
Let's get going.

5
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:06,733
But what about Su-yeong?

6
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,069
We can't bring her with us.

7
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:10,779
Then I'm going to stay here!

8
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:12,781
Yeong-su, hey…

9
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,909
I'm not going to survive this way.

10
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,870
And I'm not waiting to see you turn!

11
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:21,289
Don't say that!

12
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:23,875
I'm not gonna turn into…

13
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:26,461
Go away! She's my sister.

14
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:27,796
Don't touch me!

15
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,172
Let me go!

16
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:31,299
I said let go of me!

17
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:32,884
I'm staying!

18
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,616
I said I'm not going!

19
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:58,743
Su-yeong!

20
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:01,162
Su-yeong!

21
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,374
Take her with us!

22
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,377
I said take her with us!

23
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,546
Su-yeong!

24
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,174
I said I'm not going!

25
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:16,010
Su-yeong!

26
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:19,722
Su-yeong!

27
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:22,934
Su-yeong…

31
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,912
Oh, shit.

32
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,300
Guys, you didn't have to do all this.
I would've come if you just asked.

33
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,969
I don't have a lot of time, so…

34
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,224
That briefcase seems familiar.

35
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,853
Isn't that great?
We've recovered such a key asset.

36
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:00,646
Yeah, it really is.

37
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,732
You managed to actually find it.

38
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:05,943
Can I ask where it was?

39
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:09,322
And the one who had it, are they dead?

40
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:12,033
I think that's a safe bet. Why?

41
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,202
Do you know them?

42
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:15,495
No, it's nothing like that.

43
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:19,916
You all saw how torn up I was
when we had lost this thing, hmm?

44
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:22,793
Do the honors.

45
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,045
What for?

46
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:28,799
So what are you gonna do?

47
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,301
Are you taking this away?

48
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:32,637
You motherfucker! Just do it now!

49
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,556
Command must be secured at all cost,
so that's priority number one!

50
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,309
That's a funny way to say you're scared.

51
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:42,647
I didn't say I wouldn't.

52
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,201
Sure you won't regret it?

53
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:58,246
It prevents monsterization.
That's been confirmed.

54
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:02,166
Well, in a broad sense, yes, but…

55
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,669
I mean, before we figure out…

56
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,463
Wow, I'm really feeling
this vibe right now.

57
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:08,506
The pressure is--

58
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:09,924
Your mission was

59
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:13,219
only to create what's inside the case.

60
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:16,097
Yes, of course.

61
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,311
Moment of truth.

62
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:38,244
Oh.

63
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:47,545
What?

64
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,548
What have you done?

65
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,677
What did you do with my vaccine?

66
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:58,764
The vaccine is secure from…

67
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,226
being discovered, especially by…

68
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:04,228
you.

69
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:50,650
Hey. Hey.

70
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,318
Get up.

71
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:55,571
Okay? Wake up.

72
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,543
Um, I should get going.

73
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,171
You're going off alone?

74
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:16,384
I should report in 'cause duty calls.

75
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:17,677
You're going back to them?

76
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,595
You should stay with us.

77
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,473
Yeah, I mean, just take off
your uniform, right?

78
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:23,891
What are they going to do,
come after you?

79
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:25,643
Don't say things like that.

80
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:27,687
Desertion is a capital offense.

81
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,732
I'm sure that there's a way for me
to report back over here.

82
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:58,050
Please enter in an orderly fashion.

83
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,720
Please lower your masks and look this way.

84
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,513
Standard procedure. Put it down.

85
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:04,098
Sir, place your belongings down.

86
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,683
Get your hands off me while you still can.

87
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:07,977
- It's standard procedure.
- It's a gun!

88
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,563
- Shit! Hands off.
- Grab him! Open his bag!

89
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:13,774
- Grab it!
- Shit.

90
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,276
- Take him in.
- What's going on?

91
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,236
This way, asshole.

92
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,157
Get him out of here.

93
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,408
What is that?

94
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:27,538
Damn it!

95
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,625
Hey! Get him out of here!

96
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,839
Move it, keep going.

97
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:38,716
Quickly now.

98
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,384
Why did they beat him up like that?

99
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,511
Let's go, hurry up.

100
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:52,480
D7, Regiment-9, Private Park Chan-yeong.

101
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,565
During the mission, I got separated.

102
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:55,858
I would like to report in.

103
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,777
Black Kite, a soldier has returned.

104
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,904

107
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:01,799
What's this about?

108
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:03,801
Sergeant Lee Gi-baek…

109
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:07,847
and Sergeant Kim Dae-un, they're both…

110
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:10,432
They didn't make it.

111
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:12,893
We could've saved them, but…

112
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,312
these sons of bitches,

113
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:18,899
they didn't even lift a finger.

114
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:22,611
Now they're telling us to go back to camp.

115
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,240
What did you just say?

116
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:28,742
They're kicking our platoon to the curb.

117
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,078
Effective at 1200 hours,

118
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:34,540
the whole fucking unit is dismissed.

119
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,627
General Han,
you formed this unit yourself.

120
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:21,378
You said…

121
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:23,964
you'd make sure to never turn a blind eye.

122
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,967
That's the reason
I responded to your message.

123
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:29,136
Right.

124
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,597
I did say that.

125
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:35,559
Why are you doing this, sir?

126
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,484
Because the Crow Platoon
is no longer needed.

127
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,986
No amount of cleaning up

128
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,322
will ever fix this now.

129
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,199
This job…

130
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,285
What about our mission?

131
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,120
Are you saying we should give up?

132
00:15:57,873 --> 00:16:00,125
It's not giving up, it's a choice.

133
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:02,336
Master Sergeant Tak.

134

135
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:08,467
Get out of here.

136
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:11,553
This nation never thanked you.

137
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,806
Just take your best soldiers and go.

138
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,266
You get out of here while you still can.

139
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:19,144
You're telling me

140
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,231
to head to camp and do what, pray?

141
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,775
No. Anywhere, but there.

142
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:27,778
You can't go there.

143
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:32,449
General…

144
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:35,035
{\an8}what is it that you aren't telling me?

00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,238
Move.

148
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:41,995
What is it?

149
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,498
No, there must've been a mistake. Hey!

150
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:45,958
Hey! I'm telling you, I'm not sick!

151
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,377
It's a mistake, okay? Let me go, man!

152
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,379
Let go! I'm not sick! Okay?

153
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:51,964
- Let go! Fuck! Let me go!
- Wait.

154
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:53,674
- What the hell do you think you are doing?
- Open up.

155
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:54,675
No!

156
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:56,802
- Move!
- Is this how you treat people?

157
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:58,053
Open the gate!

158
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,893
NOT ADMISSIBLE

159
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:11,191
Have you had a nosebleed
or fever recently?

160
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:34,548
Look this way.

161
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,261
Look at me.

00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:30,395
Bang Jin-ho.

169
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:32,940
Yes, sir.

170
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:35,567
It's a bit late.

171
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,659
I haven't heard
from Master Sergeant Tak yet.

172
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:48,163
You mean, the Master Sergeant Tak
who doesn't care if we die?

173
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,834
Don't talk
about him like that, sir.

174
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:54,711
What?

175
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,675
We weren't always
in the same unit, you know,

176
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,760
yet I still treat you
with the same respect.

177
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,972
As you should for Sergeant Tak.

178
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:06,723
You're talking like a dummy.

179
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,819
I know that you think
the world of the guy.

180
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:22,406
But he really doesn't deserve
your respect.

181
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,450
So you think the rumors are true, then?

182
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,453
That he killed his family?

183
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:30,372
The rumor itself is the issue, Jin-ho.

184
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,125
All I see…

185
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:37,129
is a man who's definitely capable of it.

186
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:49,308
Oh, shit.

187
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,518
They weren't easy to hide.

188
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:53,228
Why would I tell you now?

189
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,816
Seems like you don't fear
for your life, Dr. Lim.

190
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:01,778
I'm the only one
who can make a vaccine, right? So…

191
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:06,158
We started on a bad note.
Why don't we try this again, huh?

192
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,827
I've already given you enough chances.

193
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,996
I thought I made myself very clear.

194
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:12,956
And look where my leniency has gotten me.

195
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,249
I'm done waiting.

196
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,585
I really don't have time for this.

197
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:17,627
Sir, wait!

198
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,136
This is the beginning, Doctor.

199
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:30,474
Let's not make this more difficult
than it needs to be.

200
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:34,269
All right, so tell me.

201
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:35,812
Where are they, hmm?

202
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:45,238
<i>What is it that you aren't telling me?</i>

203
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:04,299
{\an8}CLASSIFIED DOCUMENT
TOP SECRET

204
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:20,315
Sergeant Kim.

205
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:22,859
We're all being called in.

206
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:26,321
What's going on?

207
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,824
Yeong-hu, I chose already.

208
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,826
Keep your head straight from now on.

209
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:38,583
About your pet theory, Dr. Lim.

210
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:43,588
If monsterization really is a work
of nature like you claimed,

211
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:47,175
then it probably won't end

212
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:50,095
until all of mankind

213
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,973
is wiped off the face of this planet.

214
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:57,185
So that's why I got you
this little present.

215
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:00,939
Well, that is,
if you don't disappoint me again, Dr. Lim.

216
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:04,693
What are you doing?

217
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:09,448
Cleaning up.

218
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:21,668
PLEASE COOPERATE WITH THE MILITARY
TO RESTORE ORDER AND SAFETY

219
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:24,463
<i>We'll wipe them out</i>
<i>before they get a chance to turn.</i>

220
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:28,008
<i>That should keep the world clean</i>
<i>for the time being…</i>

221
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:32,512
<i>And who knows?</i>
<i>Maybe it'll even end this whole mess.</i>

222
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:34,723
Thoughts, Dr. Lim?

223
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:41,229
And what does that mean?

224
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,647
I love it.

225
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:48,612
That's perfect.

226
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:52,324
That's it. That's right.

227
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:54,576
It's exactly what I'd do.

228
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:57,204
We should've been cleaning house
from the start.

229
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:58,705
We've all just…

230
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:01,374
We've all been living
with our heads in the sand.

231
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:03,543
That's the reason for this shit.

232
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:13,345
I'm just… I'm…

233
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:15,222
waiting.

234
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:16,556
Go for it.

235
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:18,600
What about you?

236
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:21,478
I'll tell you. I'll tell you.

237
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:24,648
I'll take you to it. I will.

238
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:28,235
Great.

239
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:30,820
Let's clean up then.

240
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:25,417
Why is that coming this way?

241
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,960
Must be some sort of error.

242
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:28,086
It's coming.

243
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,046
It's coming!

244
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:44,686
Out of my way!

245
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:43,828
Ji-su!

246
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:45,955
Yoon Ji-su!

247
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:47,874
Yoon Ji-su!

248
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,056
Su-yeong!

249
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:53,940
Su-yeong!

250
00:28:58,111 --> 00:28:59,112
Su-yeong!

251
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,517
So, you're not going to talk, are you?

252
00:30:58,606 --> 00:30:59,983
It might take time,

253
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:02,443
but I'll find it, no matter what.

254
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:05,196
I think you will never find it.

255
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:08,449
There was something I couldn't crack.

256
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:11,452
Damn, it's such a shame.

257
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:15,999
Goodbye then.

258
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:30,930
Target, clear!

259
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:32,724
Hey!

260
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:55,830
You're all going to die!

261
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:00,460
Bastard!

262
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:13,848
I'm going to kill all of you!

263
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:18,227
You bastard!

264
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:28,571
Hey, move aside!

265
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,229
Sir, it's complete.

266
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:14,117
<i>We'll blow up</i>
<i>the isolation zone first.</i>

267
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,827
<i>The rest of you, get medical supplies</i>

268
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,286
<i>and get ready to move out.</i>

269
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:33,673
<i>Tell me, what do you desire?</i>

270
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:37,093
I don't know.

271
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:40,346
<i>Do you believe</i>
<i>you can overcome this?</i>

272
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:44,350
<i>What happened to your family?</i>

273
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,270
They're all dead.

274
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:48,521
<i>Did you kill them?</i>

275
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:51,524
<i>Have you killed a human?</i>

276
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:54,318
<i>Why did you do it? Tell me.</i>

277
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:56,779
- Stop it.
- <i>What do you desire? What do you desire?</i>

278
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:58,239
<i>Then what are you now?</i>

279
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:00,449
<i>Are you a human?</i>

280
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:03,953
<i>Or a monster?</i>

281
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,000
<i>I asked you a question.</i>

282
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:10,501
Answer me.

283
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:32,607
How was your stay?

284
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:36,903
Was it better than you thought, or…

285
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:41,949
was the pain too much?

286
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:49,373
Trying to save humans.

287
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,043
Just look at you now.

288
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,212
What a sorry sight.

289
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:58,132
What should I do then?

290
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:01,886
Save you or is it just better

291
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:04,555
to kill you, once and for all?

292
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,435
Fuck it.

293
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:11,354
I'm done with this.

294
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:14,273
You stay in there

295
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:15,900
and watch this place just…

296
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:18,236
fall apart at the seams.

297
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,723
Get up. We're not done.

298
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:29,325
Just accept what you are.

299
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:32,161
You're nothing but a monster.

300
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:35,581
Yeah.

301
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:38,042
I'm a monster.

302
00:39:57,937 --> 00:39:59,939
Nothing matters anymore at this point.

303
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:04,944
The reason I went easy on you
is because you're new to all this.

304
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:07,988
But you messed it up.

305
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,701
You even got me to act
like a fucking idiot, didn't you?

306
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:14,745
But not anymore.

307
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:16,622
I won't fall

308
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,625
for that fucking shit anymore.

309
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:51,574
You don't have what it takes, do you?

310
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:12,821
Just slowly wither away.

311
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:16,825
Actually…

312
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:19,578
I want you to know…

313
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:24,083
that even when you bring out
your very best,

314
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:25,376
you're still just a failure.

315
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,388
You can't save anyone.

316
00:42:38,138 --> 00:42:39,682
Even yourself.

317
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:43,394
So just stay right here.

318
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:49,024
See?

319
00:47:58,792 --> 00:47:59,793
Oh, no…

320
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:14,016
Yeong-su.

321
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:16,393
Yeong-su. Yeong-su. Yeong-su.

322
00:48:16,476 --> 00:48:17,436
Get up.

323
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:19,313
Get up.

324
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:22,482
That's right, Yeong-su.

325
00:48:26,945 --> 00:48:29,656
Get up. Get up. Get up.

326
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,783
Go on now. Yeong-su, hurry.

327
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:33,201
Hurry. Hurry.

328
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:37,122
Yeong-su, you have to move now.

329
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:40,417
Yeong-su, hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

330
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:41,793
Now, Yeong-su.

331
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:43,879
Now!

332
00:48:43,962 --> 00:48:45,756
Yeong-su, go! Get out of here!

333
00:48:47,382 --> 00:48:50,093
Get out. Now. Get up.

334
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:53,555
Go! Go!

335
00:48:54,973 --> 00:48:57,225
Yeong-su, go!

336
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,895
Get out of here, hurry!

337
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:01,396
Hurry up! Go!

338
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,232
Yeong-su, please. Please. Yeong-su.

339
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:05,317
Go!

340
00:49:06,526 --> 00:49:08,153
Hurry up, please. Yeong-su…

341
00:49:08,236 --> 00:49:10,906
Go on. Go now. Yeong-su, get out of here.

342
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:12,741
Ji-su…

343
00:49:12,824 --> 00:49:14,993
- Go!
- Yoon Ji-su!

344
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:16,161
Yoon Ji-su!

345
00:49:17,162 --> 00:49:18,372
Yeong-su, please.

346
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:27,422
Come on, get out, now! Now!

347
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:29,216
Get out of here, hurry!

348
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:44,189
Ji-su!

349
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:48,568
Ji-su! Ji-su, get up!

350
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:50,487
Ji-su!

351
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:07,045
Oh, no. Please!

352
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:16,847
It can't… This can't…

353
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:19,599
No! No, please! Please!

354
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:32,070
No…

355
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:40,454
Ji-su!

356
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:54,713
This will be our base camp.

357
00:52:54,796 --> 00:52:56,047
We don't know what's here.

358
00:52:56,882 --> 00:52:58,133
Lock up all entry points.

359
00:52:58,717 --> 00:52:59,676
Yes, sir.

360
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:07,267
What do we do
about supplies, sir?

361
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:08,768
We don't even have any water.

362
00:53:10,103 --> 00:53:11,479
We'll just find what we can.

363
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:14,232
We'll head out as soon as we're situated.

364
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:19,571
Freeze! Don't move!

365
00:53:19,654 --> 00:53:20,572
Hold it.

366
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:33,919
How many of you are here?

367
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:35,837
Four hundred, give or take.

368
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:38,757
That's good. We can definitely
accommodate them, then.
