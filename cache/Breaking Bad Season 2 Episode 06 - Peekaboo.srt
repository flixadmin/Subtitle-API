2
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:42,286
- Yo.
- Yo.

3
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:43,746
What up?

4
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:45,075
Damn, bitch.

5
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:53,709
- You got something for me?
- Yeah. Yeah, I found them.

6
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,849
- Is this a five or an S?
- Five, yo.

7
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,936
No, wait. S.

8
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:08,015
- No, no. Yeah, five.
- Yeah?

9
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:13,193
Jesus, how the hell do you spell
"street" wrong? S-T-R-E-A-T?

10
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:14,438
Hey, man.

11
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:17,694
I'm slinging mad volume
and fat stacking Benjies.

12
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,663
I can't be all about,
like, spelling and shit.

13
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:22,367
Hey.

14
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,291
So they got names?

15
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:28,748
Hers is, like, I don't know.
She's just his woman is all.

16
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:30,838
Him, they call Spooge.

17
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:36,262
Spooge?
Not Mad Dog, not Diesel?

18
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:38,381
Let me get this straight.
You got jacked...

19
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,556
...by a guy named Spooge?

20
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,392
Yo, what's his name matter?

21
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:46,185
All's I saw was that knife
he stuck in my face, like that big.

22
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:49,019
If you're looking for a reason
not to go do this thing...

23
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,393
- Did I say that?
- Because I'll go do it myself.

24
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:55,905
- It's just I'm on probation and all.
- Yeah.

25
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,776
So you gonna do it?

26
00:01:59,912 --> 00:02:01,287
Yeah.

27
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:03,738
Good. Right on.

28
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:10,171
Because these two,
they need to get got.

29
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,554
Where's my money, bitch?
Where's my money?

30
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,639
Where's my...?

31
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:50,679
Where's my money, bitch?
Huh, bitch?

32
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:54,017
Where's my money, bitch?
Oh, that's good.

33
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,812
Where's my money?

34
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:58,435
Where's my money, bitch?
Bitch, where's my money?

35
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,778
Come on.

36
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:07,622
I will mess you up.

37
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:10,785
That how you wanna play this?
Your call.

38
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:13,539
Your funeral, jack.

39
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:19,543
Hey, do not mess with me.
I will bury you because I'm crazy, yo.

40
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,547
Yeah, mucho loco.

41
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:25,883
Do not test me.

42
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:38,027
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

43
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:40,988
Honey, you blocking the mailbox.

44
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:44,481
Yeah, sorry. Sorry.

45
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:47,275
Looks like it's gonna be
a nice day, huh?

46
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:50,532
Yeah. Yeah. High 70s.

47
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:54,877
- You have a great day.
- Right on. You too.

48
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:13,555
God. Shit.

49
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:49,757
Yo, anybody home?

50
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:55,594
Hello?

51
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:56,949
Tonight, you will receive
the ultimate mixture of cutlery...

52
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:59,409
...tonight in the steel knockout.

53
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:02,545
Every phone line jammed.
Eighty-nine dollars on flex pay.

54
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:05,081
That's 15 easy installments.

55
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,301
And, folks, the knockout is only...

56
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:11,264
Hey, yo, is anybody else home?

57
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:14,047
Now, Terry put this one together...

58
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:16,841
Where's your folks? They here?

59
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:18,971
...and I'm here to tell you...

60
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:24,350
Yeah, guys,
you might wanna put up like a...

61
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,398
Already done it.

62
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,736
Tonight, folks...

63
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:39,081
Do you realize how long it's been...

64
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:43,871
...since we've offered this sword
in this set?

65
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:50,424
Much less the watashi and tanto
as a bonus in the deal.

66
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,297
It's no wonder...

67
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:55,599
It is no wonder so many of you
are on the line right now...

68
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:56,924
What's your name?

69
00:07:57,144 --> 00:08:00,429
I'm gonna count this as one.
Even though there are three, I'm...

70
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:04,099
My name's Diesel.

71
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:06,275
...eleven, 12, 13...

72
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:10,614
...sixteen, 17, 18, 19...

73
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:13,362
Yo, don't you wanna watch
something other than this?

74
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:17,195
Like, I don't know, Mister Rogers'?

75
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:21,578
Imagine this plan,
this set in your own home.

76
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:24,747
Folks, custom pieces...

77
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:34,388
Well, needless to say,
I've made a pretty good mess...

78
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:36,840
...but there's a reason for that.

79
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:42,301
Just because these are under $10,
don't let anybody kid you.

80
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:46,141
These knives possess edges like...

81
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:59,239
So when are your folks
coming home?

82
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:03,833
Your dad, Mr. Spooge?
When is he getting back?

83
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:08,663
I'm hungry.

84
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,845
Hey there, you three.

85
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:18,843
Just wanted to wish Walt
a good first day back.

86
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:24,017
We'll be thinking about you
teaching valences and covalences...

87
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:27,351
Okay, that's all I officially
remembered. Good luck.

88
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:30,403
Skyler, give me a call
when you get a chance.

89
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:36,444
Hi, Walt and Skyler.
This is Gretchen Schwartz...

90
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,700
...calling to say hello.

91
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:42,032
I'm down from Santa Fe today
and I was thinking about you both...

92
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:43,494
...hoping everything's well.

93
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:46,793
I tried Walt's cell, and it said
the number had been disconnected...

94
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:49,495
...so I'm just hoping
that everything's okay.

95
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:51,873
Call me if you can,
whenever's convenient.

96
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:56,718
- Hello?
- Oh, hi, Gretchen.

97
00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:00,382
This is Skyler White.
Am I catching you at a bad time?

98
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:02,724
No. No, not at all.

99
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,392
It's so good to hear from you.
How is everybody?

100
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:06,981
We're very well, thank you.

101
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:11,690
Walt is actually at work today.
It's his first day back at work...

102
00:10:11,904 --> 00:10:15,237
...and he lost his cell phone
quite a while back.

103
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:17,323
And I really hope
we didn't worry you.

104
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:20,488
No, no. I'm just so glad to hear
that everybody's fine.

105
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:22,079
That's wonderful.

106
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:27,117
Gretchen, I'm so very,
very long overdue in telling you this...

107
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:31,250
...and I have to take Walt at his word
that he's been passing it along for me.

108
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:33,707
I mean, he's been so adamant...

109
00:10:33,926 --> 00:10:37,591
...about wanting to handle this
whole thing by himself, and...

110
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:40,592
But I have picked up the phone
about a hundred times. I just...

111
00:10:41,517 --> 00:10:46,225
- What? What is it?
- I can't...

112
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:49,937
...begin to thank you and Elliott
for what you've done.

113
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:54,402
The money for Walt's treatment,
it's just...

114
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:58,232
It saved us.

115
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:03,320
I don't know if I...

116
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:06,290
Walt keeps saying,
"Don't bother them. It's no big deal."

117
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,706
But it is a big deal. Yeah.

118
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:12,370
To me. And to all of us.

119
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:15,259
So I just...

120
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:19,714
...finally wanted to say thank you.

121
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:25,720
Anyway...

122
00:11:27,271 --> 00:11:28,350
End of speech.

123
00:11:28,564 --> 00:11:31,233
So I do...
I hope we get to see you soon.

124
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:36,317
Truly, anytime you're in town,
anytime at all, is good for us.

125
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:41,367
- How about this afternoon?
- Yeah, okay.

126
00:11:44,288 --> 00:11:47,657
Monoalkenes, diolefins...

127
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:51,457
...trienes, polyenes.

128
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:55,121
I mean, the nomenclature alone
is enough to make your head spin.

129
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,380
But when you start
to feel overwhelmed...

130
00:11:57,593 --> 00:11:59,834
...and you will...

131
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:04,181
...just keep in mind
that one element...

132
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:06,633
...carbon.

133
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:10,351
Carbon is at the center of it all.

134
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:14,312
There is no life without carbon.

135
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:17,017
Nowhere that we know of
in the universe.

136
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:24,154
Everything that lives, lived,
will live, carbon.

137
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:26,992
Carmen is carbon.

138
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:32,167
Sorry. Assistant Principal Carmen.
Did you...?

139
00:12:33,504 --> 00:12:35,377
No. Okay.

140
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:38,999
I like to think of it...

141
00:12:40,052 --> 00:12:43,503
I like to think that the diamond...

142
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:45,762
...and the woman
who wears it on her finger...

143
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:49,178
...are both formed
from the same stuff.

144
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:55,348
Or, say, the diamond
and the man who invented it.

145
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:58,893
That got your attention, right?

146
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:02,813
The man who invented the diamond.
All right.

147
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:08,109
H. Tracy Hall.
Write this name down.

148
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:13,245
Dr. Hall invented
the first reproducible process...

149
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,868
...for making synthetic diamonds.

150
00:13:16,088 --> 00:13:18,246
I mean, this is way back in the '50s.

151
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:23,626
Now, today, synthetic diamonds
are used in oil drilling...

152
00:13:23,846 --> 00:13:28,554
...electronics,
multi-billion-dollar industries.

153
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:32,350
At the time, Dr. Hall
worked for General Electric.

154
00:13:32,563 --> 00:13:37,521
And he made them a fortune.
I mean, incalculable.

155
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:44,942
You wanna know
how GE rewarded Dr. Hall?

156
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:50,443
A $10 U.S. Savings Bond.

157
00:14:01,884 --> 00:14:03,592
Anyway...

158
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:07,927
A savings bond
printed on carbon-based paper...

159
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,682
...paid to a carbon-based man...

160
00:14:09,892 --> 00:14:15,562
...for something
he made out of carbon.

161
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:19,268
It's so nice to have you back with us.

162
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:23,315
You're looking great, by the way.

163
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:28,026
A little skinnier,
which is definitely no tragedy.

164
00:14:28,243 --> 00:14:31,493
- And then there's the hair thing.
- I actually like that.

165
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:33,994
That's a great look for you.

166
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:41,414
- But you're feeling good?
- Oh, absolutely. Hundred percent.

167
00:14:41,632 --> 00:14:43,790
It's...

168
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:45,468
I'm glad to be back at work.

169
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:50,553
I'm glad to... You know,
I'm happy to be here. Really.

170
00:14:50,766 --> 00:14:52,758
We're happy too.

171
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:56,641
And I just...

172
00:14:58,524 --> 00:15:02,817
Yeah. It's good. It's great.

173
00:15:06,365 --> 00:15:09,864
Is everything okay?

174
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:16,243
Just please feel comfortable
coming to me...

175
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:21,203
...with any problems, any issues.
Anything at all.

176
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:24,339
You know, completely confidential.

177
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,459
Okay?

178
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:33,716
- See you tomorrow, Flynn.
- See you, Jeffrey.

179
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:37,474
Oh, man.

180
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:51,902
Let me see it.

181
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:56,988
- Dad, let me see it.
- Don't worry about it.

182
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:03,545
Hey, let's go.

183
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:39,615
Forty-eight dollars,
that's the original price...

184
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:42,950
Hey.

185
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:47,078
Peekaboo.

186
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:52,632
No?

187
00:16:57,643 --> 00:16:59,053
Peekaboo.

188
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:04,637
Oh, man.

189
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:09,813
Oh, my hand is cramping up!

190
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:14,904
Oh, my God. Here, here, here.

191
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:18,496
Now, I don't know.
If you want your hand to stop aching...

192
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:21,576
...I gave you advice,
take it or leave it.

193
00:17:23,502 --> 00:17:29,789
Okay, you stay right here, all right?
Okay? I mean it.

194
00:17:43,564 --> 00:17:44,762
- Shut up!
- You shut up.

195
00:17:44,982 --> 00:17:47,389
- You shut up, you...
- You shut up!

196
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:50,314
- You're the one who dropped it.
- I didn't drop it.

197
00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:51,525
I didn't drop...

198
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:53,945
- Shit! You dropped it.
- Shut the hell up about it.

199
00:17:54,157 --> 00:17:55,533
- You shut up!
- You shut up.

200
00:17:59,663 --> 00:18:01,205
Get up.

201
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:06,867
Shut up. Shut up! Both of you.

202
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:30,519
- You know who might have done it?
- I have an idea.

203
00:18:33,572 --> 00:18:35,897
Well, here's what I think.

204
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:40,577
You ID them, and then together,
you and I put a bag over their heads...

205
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:45,948
...we tie them up, drive them way out
into the desert, strip them naked...

206
00:18:46,168 --> 00:18:51,542
...then bury them up to their necks
in a huge mound of fire ants.

207
00:18:52,758 --> 00:18:55,213
Saw it in an old Western.

208
00:18:58,639 --> 00:19:00,299
You with me?

209
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:05,427
Scorpions?

210
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:10,603
Scorpions are good.

211
00:19:11,026 --> 00:19:12,900
Yeah.

212
00:19:20,536 --> 00:19:21,781
Nice.

213
00:19:35,467 --> 00:19:39,465
Damn, Dad. Check it out.

214
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,253
Who is this?

215
00:20:01,285 --> 00:20:04,155
So this is Walter Jr., or Flynn.

216
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:06,494
He likes to go by Flynn these days.

217
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:09,079
- Mom.
- What? I'm just offering the choice.

218
00:20:09,293 --> 00:20:11,784
This is Mrs. Schwartz,
whom you've heard so much about.

219
00:20:12,004 --> 00:20:14,958
- Very nice to meet you, Flynn.
- Nice to meet you too.

220
00:20:15,174 --> 00:20:16,336
Oh, Walt.

221
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:19,962
Look who's here.

222
00:20:20,179 --> 00:20:21,174
- Gretchen.
- Hi.

223
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:24,424
Always nice to see you.
What a nice surprise.

224
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:27,179
Look at you. You're looking good.

225
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:29,387
Though a bald head
is a bit of a shocker.

226
00:20:29,605 --> 00:20:31,099
I know it was for me.

227
00:20:31,315 --> 00:20:34,897
Oh, you have a good-shaped head.

228
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,485
- May I?
- Oh, sure.

229
00:20:36,695 --> 00:20:39,898
- For good luck, right?
- Exactly. Here's hoping.

230
00:20:40,115 --> 00:20:41,740
- We could use some of that.
- Yeah.

231
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:46,197
Mrs. Schwartz, thank you so much
for what you've done for my dad.

232
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:52,206
- It was a really good thing.
- You're very welcome.

233
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:55,539
- We're gonna find a way to repay you.
- No, no, no.

234
00:20:55,756 --> 00:20:58,876
We don't wanna ever hear that.

235
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:03,214
You know, I hate to say it...

236
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:06,550
...but I really need to get going.

237
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:08,391
Oh, that's too bad.

238
00:21:08,602 --> 00:21:10,641
- You can't stay for dinner?
- I wish I could...

239
00:21:10,854 --> 00:21:14,188
...but unfortunately,
I have to try to beat the traffic.

240
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:15,395
Okay. Okay.

241
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:20,401
Well, I hope we get a chance
to catch up real soon.

242
00:21:20,614 --> 00:21:21,894
Yeah, hopefully.

243
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:24,951
Gretchen, your purse.

244
00:21:26,453 --> 00:21:29,027
Well, good to see you.

245
00:21:29,748 --> 00:21:33,995
And you and Elliott
are welcome anytime. Really.

246
00:21:35,045 --> 00:21:38,496
And I, for one, am gonna be
much better about keeping in touch.

247
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:40,838
- It's so good to see you.
- And you.

248
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:44,965
- Nice meeting you.
- Likewise.

249
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:49,048
- Okay. Bye, now.
- Drive safely.

250
00:21:50,644 --> 00:21:53,680
You know, what am I thinking?
I should walk her to her car. Really.

251
00:21:53,897 --> 00:21:55,724
I'll be right back.

252
00:21:59,611 --> 00:22:01,236
Gretchen.

253
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:03,235
Hey.

254
00:22:08,203 --> 00:22:10,777
- Hey.
- Hey yourself.

255
00:22:10,998 --> 00:22:12,824
What did you...?

256
00:22:15,377 --> 00:22:17,204
We need to talk.

257
00:22:17,421 --> 00:22:21,465
Can you not do or say
anything to anyone until then?

258
00:22:22,718 --> 00:22:25,719
Please. Please.

259
00:22:39,943 --> 00:22:44,570
Where's my money, bitch?
I ain't gonna keep asking nice!

260
00:22:44,781 --> 00:22:48,910
Yo, all right? I want my money
and my dope. Come on!

261
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:52,453
- I just wanna say, man...
- What? What do you wanna say?

262
00:22:52,664 --> 00:22:54,159
I just wanna go on record, man.

263
00:22:54,374 --> 00:22:57,743
You hit me really, really hard, man.
I think I'm seeing double.

264
00:22:57,961 --> 00:23:00,250
- Maybe I need to go see a hospital.
- Shut up!

265
00:23:00,464 --> 00:23:02,255
Jesus.

266
00:23:02,466 --> 00:23:05,799
- Serious, I might have a concussion.
- Don't fall asleep, baby.

267
00:23:06,011 --> 00:23:07,920
- Subdural hematoma.
- Don't fall asleep.

268
00:23:08,138 --> 00:23:10,676
Shut up.

269
00:23:11,433 --> 00:23:13,011
All right. Empty your pockets.

270
00:23:13,227 --> 00:23:15,599
Turn them out,
everything on the table.

271
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:17,011
Do it!

272
00:23:21,985 --> 00:23:23,527
All right, turn around.

273
00:23:23,737 --> 00:23:24,982
Turn around.

274
00:23:25,489 --> 00:23:27,778
Turn out your back pockets.
Come on.

275
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:36,530
All right. Shoes. Give them here.

276
00:23:50,097 --> 00:23:52,006
I told you, Diesel,
we ain't holding any...

277
00:23:52,224 --> 00:23:53,884
- We shot it all.
- Yeah?

278
00:23:54,518 --> 00:23:57,388
- Shot an ounce in a day and a half?
- Yeah.

279
00:23:57,604 --> 00:23:59,727
All right, tell you what.

280
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:03,724
Both of you
pull it out of your butts right now...

281
00:24:03,944 --> 00:24:07,894
...or I grab a flashlight and
some pliers and go exploring.

282
00:24:08,115 --> 00:24:10,024
What's it gonna be, yo? Come on.

283
00:24:13,453 --> 00:24:15,245
There you go.

284
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:20,450
All right, come on.
On the table.

285
00:24:21,378 --> 00:24:24,664
All right, so, what, you hold the
crystal and she holds the H, huh?

286
00:24:24,882 --> 00:24:25,913
Division of labor.

287
00:24:27,593 --> 00:24:31,293
All right,
there's maybe an 8 ball here.

288
00:24:31,513 --> 00:24:33,589
Where's the rest of my meth?

289
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:36,215
Yo, for real? She up and lost it, yo.

290
00:24:36,435 --> 00:24:38,309
- You shut up.
- You shut up, skank.

291
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,355
Shut up! Shut up! Stop it!

292
00:24:41,857 --> 00:24:45,226
This really isn't getting any better,
man. It's turning cranial.

293
00:24:45,444 --> 00:24:48,943
Oh, yeah? You see this gun?
It's got five bullets.

294
00:24:49,156 --> 00:24:52,323
One for each kneecap,
plus an extra round for your cranial...

295
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:55,321
...for being such a pussy.

296
00:24:57,831 --> 00:25:01,283
Hey. Hey, baby.

297
00:25:01,502 --> 00:25:05,369
Come here, baby.
Come here, baby.

298
00:25:10,677 --> 00:25:12,337
All right.

299
00:25:12,554 --> 00:25:15,970
You two are never
getting high again.

300
00:25:16,183 --> 00:25:18,756
I will make it my life's mission.

301
00:25:18,977 --> 00:25:21,647
Not another needle,
not another ball...

302
00:25:21,855 --> 00:25:25,900
...not one toke,
not till I get what's mine.

303
00:25:28,278 --> 00:25:30,152
Yeah, we got you covered,
man, sure.

304
00:25:30,364 --> 00:25:33,530
It just so happens we got
your money, man, plus interest.

305
00:25:33,742 --> 00:25:35,236
You're damn right, plus interest.

306
00:25:35,452 --> 00:25:37,943
- Where?
- Back yard.

307
00:25:38,163 --> 00:25:40,785
Yo, right hand to the man, dog.
Back yard. Go check it out.

308
00:25:40,999 --> 00:25:44,166
- Hurting. Painful.
- Hey, hey, hey.

309
00:25:44,378 --> 00:25:48,078
Me and your old man,
we're just playing a game, all right?

310
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:51,299
Hey, don't move.

311
00:25:54,596 --> 00:25:56,340
Come on.

312
00:25:58,767 --> 00:26:00,012
See?

313
00:26:00,227 --> 00:26:03,477
Me and the slit just boosted it, yo.
She's like a ant, man.

314
00:26:03,689 --> 00:26:06,524
She can lift a hundred times
her own weight. For real.

315
00:26:06,733 --> 00:26:08,525
What am I supposed to do with this?

316
00:26:08,735 --> 00:26:11,689
Help me break it open.
Take out the money, get paid.

317
00:26:11,905 --> 00:26:14,194
Get high.

318
00:26:18,495 --> 00:26:20,073
Yo, that's my bank.

319
00:26:20,289 --> 00:26:22,495
So? It's FIDC insured, yo.

320
00:26:22,708 --> 00:26:25,199
It's a victimless crime.

321
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:26,950
Where did you get this?

322
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,459
Bodega. Way across town.

323
00:26:29,673 --> 00:26:32,164
In, out, like, bam.
Went smooth as silk, yo.

324
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:35,677
What, nobody saw you?
What about witnesses, dumb-ass?

325
00:26:35,888 --> 00:26:38,046
We roll like the breeze, for real.

326
00:26:38,265 --> 00:26:40,590
All we did,
we just walked in all smooth-like.

327
00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:43,051
- Nobody even noticed.
- Nobody noticed?

328
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:47,932
- For real?
- I'm telling you, victimless crime.

329
00:26:58,202 --> 00:27:00,159
Oh, my God.

330
00:27:01,747 --> 00:27:04,238
Jesus. Come on already.

331
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:07,909
- It's about to give, man. I'm sensing it.
- You don't know what you're doing.

332
00:27:08,128 --> 00:27:10,536
I thought you told me
you boosted, like, six of these.

333
00:27:10,756 --> 00:27:12,914
Yeah. Boosted.

334
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:15,090
It's not like he ever got one open.

335
00:27:15,302 --> 00:27:17,093
At least I got persistence.

336
00:27:17,304 --> 00:27:20,175
The law of averages,
lucky number seven.

337
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:24,933
- Don't listen to that skank.
- Stop calling me that.

338
00:27:25,687 --> 00:27:27,230
I ain't no skank!

339
00:27:27,439 --> 00:27:29,764
- Skank, skank, skank...
- Hey, hey, hey.

340
00:27:29,983 --> 00:27:31,478
Sit, sit.

341
00:27:31,693 --> 00:27:35,773
All right, I swear to God
I will shoot you both in the face.

342
00:27:36,615 --> 00:27:38,572
Now, chill.

343
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:42,077
You, get that thing open.

344
00:27:42,287 --> 00:27:46,451
You sit the hell down,
and no throwing things.

345
00:27:50,921 --> 00:27:52,914
Where's the kid?

346
00:27:54,508 --> 00:27:55,967
The kid. The little kid!

347
00:27:56,176 --> 00:27:59,130
What are you asking me for?

348
00:28:15,404 --> 00:28:18,986
I got you now, bitch. I got you now.

349
00:28:19,199 --> 00:28:20,444
Didn't see that coming, huh?

350
00:28:25,163 --> 00:28:26,444
What kind of mother are you?

351
00:28:27,875 --> 00:28:31,374
How about you feed the kid a decent
meal every now and then, huh?

352
00:28:31,587 --> 00:28:34,125
Give him a bath.
Put some baby powder on him.

353
00:28:34,339 --> 00:28:37,009
Get him some decent TV to watch.
I mean, what is this shit?

354
00:28:37,217 --> 00:28:38,676
Are you serious?

355
00:28:38,886 --> 00:28:42,005
You give me one hit, and I'll be
any kind of mother that you want.

356
00:28:42,222 --> 00:28:43,598
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, Diesel...

357
00:28:43,807 --> 00:28:46,678
...this thing would go easier
if we all had a little taste, man.

358
00:28:48,854 --> 00:28:50,265
Get out of the way.

359
00:28:50,772 --> 00:28:53,098
Get out of the way!

360
00:29:08,957 --> 00:29:10,333
So you didn't tell anyone.

361
00:29:10,542 --> 00:29:13,911
- You didn't tell Elliott.
- Not yet.

362
00:29:14,713 --> 00:29:18,378
- Well, what does that mean?
- That means exactly what it means.

363
00:29:18,592 --> 00:29:21,878
That's a determination
I have yet to make.

364
00:29:24,556 --> 00:29:27,890
All right, fair enough.
I can appreciate that.

365
00:29:28,101 --> 00:29:29,216
All right.

366
00:29:29,436 --> 00:29:34,727
First let me say, I very much
regret involving you in this.

367
00:29:34,942 --> 00:29:36,899
This was...

368
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:40,942
This entire thing was unfortunate.

369
00:29:41,156 --> 00:29:43,398
Unfortunate?

370
00:29:44,785 --> 00:29:47,951
And I apologise deeply.

371
00:29:48,539 --> 00:29:50,081
Thank you.

372
00:29:51,625 --> 00:29:54,911
Now please tell me why you did it.

373
00:29:56,672 --> 00:30:00,504
That's not really at issue here.

374
00:30:00,843 --> 00:30:04,757
Well, you told me your insurance
was covering it. Was that a lie?

375
00:30:06,932 --> 00:30:10,099
If you won't take our money,
and your insurance isn't covering it...

376
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,769
...how are you paying for it?

377
00:30:11,979 --> 00:30:16,724
This is not an issue
that concerns you, Gretchen, okay?

378
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:20,111
Excuse me, Walt. It does concern me.
It concerns me greatly.

379
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,025
You tell your wife and son...

380
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,446
...that I am paying
for your cancer treatment.

381
00:30:25,659 --> 00:30:28,280
Why are you doing this?

382
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,951
I will clear this up with them.

383
00:30:33,166 --> 00:30:36,370
The look on Skyler's face,
she's sitting there, tears in her eyes...

384
00:30:36,587 --> 00:30:38,211
...thanking me for saving your life.

385
00:30:38,422 --> 00:30:42,502
- Why would you do that to her?
- As I said, I will clear this up.

386
00:30:42,718 --> 00:30:47,427
Just please allow me to do this
in my own way, in my own time.

387
00:30:47,639 --> 00:30:48,635
All right?

388
00:30:48,849 --> 00:30:51,470
I will explain
the whole thing to them.

389
00:30:51,685 --> 00:30:54,141
And while you're at it,
explain it to me.

390
00:30:57,065 --> 00:30:59,391
I don't owe you an explanation.

391
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:03,228
I owe you an apology,
and I have apologized.

392
00:31:03,447 --> 00:31:06,234
I am very sorry, Gretchen.

393
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:09,404
There. I've apologized twice now.

394
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:12,490
I'm humbly sorry.

395
00:31:12,706 --> 00:31:14,165
Three times.

396
00:31:14,374 --> 00:31:16,332
Let me just get this straight.

397
00:31:16,543 --> 00:31:18,915
Elliott and I offer
to pay for your treatment...

398
00:31:19,129 --> 00:31:20,588
...no strings attached.

399
00:31:20,797 --> 00:31:23,004
An offer which still stands,
by the way.

400
00:31:23,217 --> 00:31:25,886
And you turn us down out of pride,
whatever...

401
00:31:26,094 --> 00:31:30,507
...and then you tell your wife that in
fact we are paying for your treatment.

402
00:31:30,724 --> 00:31:32,551
Without our knowledge,
against our will...

403
00:31:32,768 --> 00:31:34,760
...you involve us in your lie.

404
00:31:34,978 --> 00:31:40,851
And you sit here and tell me
that that is none of my business?

405
00:31:42,861 --> 00:31:46,811
Yeah.
That's pretty much the size of it.

406
00:31:49,326 --> 00:31:51,698
What happened to you?

407
00:31:54,581 --> 00:31:56,704
Really, Walt.

408
00:31:56,917 --> 00:31:58,708
What happened?

409
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:01,706
Because this isn't you.

410
00:32:04,758 --> 00:32:08,626
What would you know about me,
Gretchen?

411
00:32:08,846 --> 00:32:13,258
What would your presumption
about me be, exactly?

412
00:32:13,475 --> 00:32:15,800
That I should go begging
for your charity?

413
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,853
And you waving
your checkbook around...

414
00:32:20,065 --> 00:32:23,600
...like some magic wand
is gonna make me forget...

415
00:32:23,819 --> 00:32:24,933
...how you and Elliott...

416
00:32:25,153 --> 00:32:28,238
How you and Elliott cut me out?

417
00:32:28,448 --> 00:32:30,240
What? That can't be how you see it.

418
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:33,902
It was my hard work, my research,
and you and Elliott make millions off it.

419
00:32:34,121 --> 00:32:36,030
That cannot be how you see it.

420
00:32:36,248 --> 00:32:38,157
- Good. That's beautifully done.
- You left...

421
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:40,166
You are always
the picture of innocence.

422
00:32:40,377 --> 00:32:42,915
- You left me.
- The picture of innocence.

423
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:46,665
- Just sweetness and light.
- You left me.

424
00:32:47,467 --> 00:32:48,748
Newport, 4th of July weekend.

425
00:32:48,969 --> 00:32:52,089
You and my father and my brothers
and I go up to our room...

426
00:32:52,306 --> 00:32:54,879
...and you're packing your bags,
barely talking.

427
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,769
What? Did I dream all of that?

428
00:32:57,978 --> 00:33:00,469
That's your excuse...

429
00:33:00,689 --> 00:33:03,476
...to build your little empire
on my work?

430
00:33:03,692 --> 00:33:05,934
How can you say that to me?
You walked away.

431
00:33:06,153 --> 00:33:09,189
You abandoned us, me, Elliott.

432
00:33:09,406 --> 00:33:12,111
Little rich girl
just adding to your millions.

433
00:33:16,538 --> 00:33:20,121
I don't even know what to say to you.

434
00:33:20,834 --> 00:33:23,871
I don't even know where to begin.

435
00:33:29,176 --> 00:33:34,515
I feel so sorry for you, Walt.

436
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,638
Fuck you.

437
00:34:15,264 --> 00:34:17,173
Hey.

438
00:34:20,227 --> 00:34:23,762
Hey, little man, you hungry?

439
00:34:37,578 --> 00:34:39,120
Hey.

440
00:35:01,935 --> 00:35:04,806
Man. No, no, what are you doing?

441
00:35:06,648 --> 00:35:07,680
No, what are you doing?

442
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:12,103
Spooge, I got him, I got him.

443
00:35:12,321 --> 00:35:13,981
Baby, get up and help me.

444
00:35:14,198 --> 00:35:17,732
Call me a bad mother.
I'll show you a bad mother, bitch.

445
00:35:17,951 --> 00:35:19,860
Get up, damn it! Get our dope!

446
00:35:23,749 --> 00:35:24,828
Bedtime.

447
00:35:28,587 --> 00:35:31,125
Here we go. Oh, yeah.

448
00:35:35,928 --> 00:35:38,763
Who's the big tough guy now, huh?
Is that you?

449
00:35:38,972 --> 00:35:40,846
Is that you? You're the big man?

450
00:35:41,058 --> 00:35:43,727
Try and hit me now, bitch.
Try and hit me now!

451
00:35:43,936 --> 00:35:46,557
Try and hit me now, bitch.

452
00:36:18,303 --> 00:36:19,584
Oh, hey.

453
00:36:19,805 --> 00:36:22,212
Should I ask where you've been?

454
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:25,058
Never mind.

455
00:36:25,269 --> 00:36:28,270
We're long past that, I suppose.

456
00:36:29,356 --> 00:36:31,183
Skyler.

457
00:36:37,322 --> 00:36:40,738
Gretchen called about an hour ago.

458
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:52,829
Walt.

459
00:36:53,714 --> 00:36:56,002
We need to talk.

460
00:37:07,769 --> 00:37:09,643
Just say it.

461
00:37:19,448 --> 00:37:22,318
They're cutting off the money.

462
00:37:34,087 --> 00:37:37,041
What did she say, exactly?

463
00:37:39,343 --> 00:37:44,384
Not much. It was abrupt.

464
00:37:44,598 --> 00:37:48,430
She said something like:

465
00:37:49,937 --> 00:37:53,851
"I'm sorry to have to do this...

466
00:37:54,066 --> 00:37:58,644
...but Elliott and I can no longer
continue to pay for Walt's treatment.

467
00:37:58,862 --> 00:38:01,947
I wish you the very best."

468
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,989
And that was it.

469
00:38:11,667 --> 00:38:13,244
Yeah.

470
00:38:13,919 --> 00:38:18,166
I mean, she sounded apologetic.
I guess.

471
00:38:18,382 --> 00:38:20,291
It was quick.
She got right off the phone.

472
00:38:20,509 --> 00:38:23,000
I was so stunned, but...

473
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:28,131
I called her back
and she didn't pick up.

474
00:38:34,106 --> 00:38:39,349
So, what do you know about this?

475
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:47,107
I mean, she and I had a perfectly nice
visit this afternoon...

476
00:38:47,327 --> 00:38:50,946
...and then you come home
and she's in a big hurry to leave...

477
00:38:51,164 --> 00:38:54,450
...and then the two of you
are talking in the driveway.

478
00:38:58,505 --> 00:39:00,249
Walt.

479
00:39:00,924 --> 00:39:02,964
What do you know that I don't?

480
00:39:07,931 --> 00:39:10,303
Where were you tonight?

481
00:39:12,269 --> 00:39:13,763
I drove up to Santa Fe.

482
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,685
I was with Gretchen.

483
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:21,150
Well, Gretchen and Elliott.

484
00:39:22,237 --> 00:39:26,899
She just couldn't bring
herself to tell you today.

485
00:39:27,117 --> 00:39:29,988
I mean, she couldn't tell me,
either, really.

486
00:39:30,204 --> 00:39:33,323
I mean, there was
a lot of hemming and hawing...

487
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,414
...and beating around the bush...

488
00:39:35,626 --> 00:39:39,493
Okay, what...? Tell us what?

489
00:39:41,256 --> 00:39:43,000
Well...

490
00:39:44,968 --> 00:39:46,000
There was a lot of...

491
00:39:47,304 --> 00:39:49,676
...business phraseology
being tossed around.

492
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:55,430
You know, things like "cash-poor"
and "leveraged"...

493
00:39:55,646 --> 00:39:57,603
..."quarterly decline,"
yadda, yadda, yadda.

494
00:39:57,814 --> 00:40:02,144
But what they were truly saying,
in my opinion...

495
00:40:06,073 --> 00:40:07,615
They're broke.

496
00:40:08,408 --> 00:40:11,196
- You are kidding me.
- No.

497
00:40:11,912 --> 00:40:14,782
I mean, the economy's in the toilet.
We all know that.

498
00:40:14,998 --> 00:40:19,625
And all these big banks
and Fannie Mae and...

499
00:40:19,837 --> 00:40:22,506
Well, apparently, Gray Matter...

500
00:40:22,714 --> 00:40:26,546
...is no more immune
than anyone else.

501
00:40:27,928 --> 00:40:29,588
That is...

502
00:40:31,348 --> 00:40:33,471
Jesus, that's...

503
00:40:36,937 --> 00:40:38,217
Yeah.

504
00:40:48,448 --> 00:40:54,569
You know, she could have
just told me herself.

505
00:40:57,165 --> 00:40:59,739
Well, they're prideful people.

506
00:41:02,379 --> 00:41:04,004
Listen.

507
00:41:05,674 --> 00:41:07,714
Not to sound selfish...

508
00:41:08,552 --> 00:41:10,924
...but as far as we go...

509
00:41:11,138 --> 00:41:14,589
...we'll get through this, okay?

510
00:41:15,142 --> 00:41:21,560
I mean, they've already paid
for most of my treatment, right?

511
00:41:22,232 --> 00:41:23,263
Hey.

512
00:41:27,404 --> 00:41:32,066
We're gonna make it. All right?
I promise.

513
00:41:32,284 --> 00:41:34,241
Okay.

514
00:41:44,922 --> 00:41:46,831
And yet...

515
00:41:48,175 --> 00:41:51,176
...she still drives a Bentley.

516
00:41:56,266 --> 00:42:00,478
Keeping up appearances.
Who knows?

517
00:42:12,866 --> 00:42:15,820
Baby, that don't make any sense.

518
00:42:16,036 --> 00:42:19,737
Of course it makes sense.
Every safe's got its weak spot, right?

519
00:42:19,957 --> 00:42:22,744
You're designing a safe, where
you gonna put your weak spot?

520
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,418
Nowhere.

521
00:42:24,628 --> 00:42:27,545
I'd make it, like, strong.

522
00:42:27,756 --> 00:42:29,832
Jesus. On the bottom, that's where.

523
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:32,173
You put your weak spot
on the bottom.

524
00:42:32,386 --> 00:42:37,095
Oh, baby,
that H is bringing me down.

525
00:42:37,307 --> 00:42:39,596
Yeah, you took too much. I told you.

526
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:42,811
I need to... I need to even out.

527
00:42:43,021 --> 00:42:46,225
- Let me get a hit of that crystal.
- Hell, no. You lost your share.

528
00:42:46,441 --> 00:42:47,722
Come on, baby.

529
00:42:47,943 --> 00:42:50,944
It's all I need, just a little hit.

530
00:42:51,154 --> 00:42:55,069
Shut the hell up, you dumb skank.
I'm trying to concentrate.

531
00:42:55,284 --> 00:42:57,110
I ain't no skank.

532
00:42:57,953 --> 00:43:01,701
I would appreciate an apology.

533
00:43:05,419 --> 00:43:06,450
What?

534
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:09,375
I am trying to take
the high road here.

535
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:10,918
Are you gonna do right?

536
00:43:11,133 --> 00:43:12,212
Listen to me, stupid.

537
00:43:12,426 --> 00:43:15,925
I am in the middle
of some very important work.

538
00:43:16,138 --> 00:43:19,886
I am on the verge here, all right?
So shut your skank ass pie hole...

539
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:23,599
...and assist me and shut up.

540
00:43:27,024 --> 00:43:29,230
I ain't no skank.

541
00:43:29,443 --> 00:43:31,400
Skank, skank, skank ass skank.

542
00:43:31,987 --> 00:43:35,071
Skank ass skank. Skank ass skank.

543
00:43:35,741 --> 00:43:37,069
You listening to me, skank?

544
00:43:37,659 --> 00:43:38,940
You hear me, skank?

545
00:43:39,161 --> 00:43:43,241
You are a skank ass skank. Skank.

546
00:43:43,457 --> 00:43:47,324
Skank, skank, skank. Skank.

547
00:43:47,544 --> 00:43:50,711
I ain't no skank.

548
00:43:51,089 --> 00:43:53,497
No, no, no. Don't. No.

549
00:44:09,775 --> 00:44:12,610
I ain't no skank.

550
00:45:12,629 --> 00:45:13,661
911.

551
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:29,432
Hey, hey.
Hey, you remember peekaboo?

552
00:45:29,646 --> 00:45:32,850
Can you go peekaboo like this?
Can you keep your eyes closed?

553
00:45:33,066 --> 00:45:35,771
You keep them closed. That's good.
That's good. That's good.

554
00:45:35,986 --> 00:45:38,192
All right.
You keep them closed just like that.

555
00:45:38,405 --> 00:45:41,856
It's a little game
we're gonna play, okay?

556
00:45:54,296 --> 00:45:56,205
Here you go.

557
00:45:56,423 --> 00:46:01,050
Hey. Hey, look at me.
You wait right here. Okay?

558
00:46:01,261 --> 00:46:04,879
It's just part of the game.
You wait right here, and...

559
00:46:06,099 --> 00:46:09,883
Look, just...
Just don't go back inside. All right?

560
00:46:10,103 --> 00:46:13,021
You stay right here. Okay?

561
00:46:19,905 --> 00:46:23,523
You have a good
rest of your life, kid.

562
