1
00:00:30,312 --> 00:00:32,940
What a mess!

2
00:00:40,122 --> 00:00:41,919
Krishna... Krishna... Krishna...

3
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:43,918
What am I going to do with this boy?

4
00:01:10,652 --> 00:01:11,550
Krishna...

5
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,046
Yes, grandma?

6
00:01:13,755 --> 00:01:15,222
Whose sketch book is this?

7
00:01:15,424 --> 00:01:17,051
Mine, grandma.

8
00:01:17,659 --> 00:01:19,388
And who made these sketches?

9
00:01:19,594 --> 00:01:23,394
Grandma, why do grown ups sometimes
ask childish questions?

10
00:01:23,598 --> 00:01:26,567
If it's my sketch book, obviously,
I've made the sketches.

11
00:01:26,768 --> 00:01:32,229
Grown ups talk like children when
children act like grown ups.

12
00:01:32,474 --> 00:01:36,740
Tell me something, how did you make
such beautiful sketches?

13
00:01:36,878 --> 00:01:37,708
With this.

14
00:01:38,013 --> 00:01:41,574
Like I've made your
sketch right now. See?

15
00:01:44,019 --> 00:01:45,077
Wow!

16
00:01:45,253 --> 00:01:46,584
Let me see!

17
00:01:49,758 --> 00:01:52,090
Rohit loved drawing too.

18
00:01:52,361 --> 00:01:53,988
Papa made sketches too?

19
00:01:54,363 --> 00:01:55,159
Yes.

20
00:01:56,631 --> 00:02:01,432
When Rohit was your age and
he used to get tired studying

21
00:02:01,803 --> 00:02:03,930
he used to sketch.

22
00:02:04,206 --> 00:02:06,606
I want to be like my Papa too.

23
00:02:07,676 --> 00:02:09,769
You are like your Papa!

24
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,278
Mrs. Mehra, I've called you here
to tell you that...

25
00:02:15,917 --> 00:02:18,112
we want to take Krishna's I.Q. test.

26
00:02:18,553 --> 00:02:19,451
I.Q. test?

27
00:02:20,889 --> 00:02:22,447
But why, Father?

28
00:02:23,325 --> 00:02:25,793
Krishna's absolutely normal.

29
00:02:25,994 --> 00:02:27,120
No, Mrs. Mehra.

30
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,458
He's not normal.

31
00:02:29,765 --> 00:02:31,630
What are you saying, Father?

32
00:02:32,501 --> 00:02:33,627
Are you telling me...

33
00:02:34,269 --> 00:02:37,966
that Krishna is the same as
Rohit was in his childhood?

34
00:02:38,673 --> 00:02:39,799
No, Father.

35
00:02:40,175 --> 00:02:42,143
Krishna's a very bright child.

36
00:02:42,677 --> 00:02:47,376
He scores very good marks, he
always gets A-plus grades.

37
00:02:47,682 --> 00:02:51,118
He even does his homework
without any help.

38
00:02:51,353 --> 00:02:53,048
And that of other children too.

39
00:02:53,722 --> 00:02:54,620
What?

40
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:58,188
This is the notebook of
a Class 3 student.

41
00:03:03,432 --> 00:03:05,332
This is...

42
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,092
...Krishna's handwriting.

43
00:03:07,269 --> 00:03:10,170
Yes, Krishna has done this
child's math homework.

44
00:03:15,143 --> 00:03:19,944
But how's that possible, Father?
Krishna's still in Class 1.

45
00:03:20,215 --> 00:03:22,775
That's exactly why we wish to
take Krishna's I.Q. test...

46
00:03:23,752 --> 00:03:30,681
so that we can ascertain just how bright,
sharp and ahead he is...

47
00:03:30,792 --> 00:03:32,885
of other children his age

48
00:03:34,162 --> 00:03:36,130
Krishna, how do you define amount?

49
00:03:36,498 --> 00:03:40,764
Principle plus interest is equal to amount, sir

50
00:03:42,671 --> 00:03:47,040
After what age does the brain
of a person stop growing?

51
00:03:47,776 --> 00:03:51,234
After the age of 15, Father.

52
00:04:08,997 --> 00:04:11,295
What happened, Mrs. Mehra?

53
00:04:11,867 --> 00:04:16,861
The I.Q. test was going so well, Krishna
was answering all questions right...

54
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,765
That's exactly why I brought him away.

55
00:04:21,343 --> 00:04:22,071
But why?

56
00:04:23,178 --> 00:04:26,807
You ought to be proud that
your grandson is so brilliant.

57
00:04:27,115 --> 00:04:30,016
He's a genius, a miracle child.

58
00:04:32,254 --> 00:04:36,554
Earlier it was a hunch
but now I'm sure.

59
00:04:37,225 --> 00:04:40,194
The powers that Jadoo
had bestowed on Rohit...

60
00:04:40,695 --> 00:04:45,894
...have been inherited by Krishna.

61
00:04:46,735 --> 00:04:50,569
You will see, Mrs. Mehra.
Like his father...

62
00:04:51,239 --> 00:04:54,208
...Krishna will also achieve
great success.

63
00:04:54,843 --> 00:04:56,470
His name will appear in
the Guinness Book...

64
00:04:57,546 --> 00:05:00,845
...and the whole world will
speak highly of him.

65
00:05:02,851 --> 00:05:04,978
That's exactly what I don't want, Father.

66
00:05:06,988 --> 00:05:09,047
What did Rohit gain, after all?

67
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,728
They gave him medals, applauded him...

68
00:05:14,596 --> 00:05:17,895
but everybody only used him...

69
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,800
...took advantage of him, Father.

70
00:05:22,637 --> 00:05:23,934
And then...

71
00:05:27,008 --> 00:05:32,469
...I lost my son and my daughter-in-law.

72
00:05:34,849 --> 00:05:37,317
I don't want to lose Krishna now.

73
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,317
I don't want to lose him.

74
00:05:41,523 --> 00:05:44,686
I can understand your concern and fears.

75
00:05:45,994 --> 00:05:48,724
But destiny cannot be changed.

76
00:05:50,098 --> 00:05:55,195
And talent is a gift which cannot be hidden.

77
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:57,297
I will hide it.

78
00:05:59,474 --> 00:06:03,774
I'll take Krishna far away...

79
00:06:05,213 --> 00:06:06,737
...very far.

80
00:07:54,923 --> 00:08:03,058
Krishna... Krishna...

81
00:08:05,366 --> 00:08:08,267
Coming, Grandma!

82
00:08:10,105 --> 00:08:12,903
Toofan, let's see who gets home first.

83
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:11,549
Hey... what did you see?

84
00:10:12,193 --> 00:10:16,857
As usual, I've seen nothing and
I won't say a word to anyone.

85
00:10:17,065 --> 00:10:19,056
But as usual, I'll take
something from you.

86
00:10:21,669 --> 00:10:22,192
Take this!

87
00:10:22,737 --> 00:10:27,333
I hide all your secrets and you
always give me jaggery?

88
00:10:27,642 --> 00:10:29,872
It won't work today.

89
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:33,172
Ok, ok, come home...
I'll give you Bournvita.

90
00:10:33,314 --> 00:10:34,246
Bournvita?

91
00:10:34,349 --> 00:10:36,249
Yes. Don't you want to be like me?

92
00:10:36,351 --> 00:10:37,409
Yes!

93
00:10:37,552 --> 00:10:39,247
So go, wear something below and come.

94
00:10:49,797 --> 00:10:50,764
Krishna...

95
00:10:53,601 --> 00:10:55,068
You've come?

96
00:10:56,971 --> 00:10:58,768
Grandma, how do you know I've come?

97
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,402
I make no sound at all!

98
00:11:01,609 --> 00:11:03,907
I can hear your heartbeats.

99
00:11:04,112 --> 00:11:05,579
But how, Grandma?

100
00:11:06,748 --> 00:11:11,708
Your eyes say that you've been
up to mischief again.

101
00:11:11,953 --> 00:11:16,390
Mischief? Not at all, Grandma!

102
00:11:16,925 --> 00:11:21,555
No mischief? Then why're you hiding
your face like a thief?

103
00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:23,888
Not hiding, just washing my face, Grandma

104
00:11:24,098 --> 00:11:27,397
Ok ok... lay the breakfast.

105
00:11:27,602 --> 00:11:28,398
I've come!

106
00:11:57,165 --> 00:11:59,463
What happened?

107
00:12:00,568 --> 00:12:04,299
Chintu dropped a glass, Grandma...

108
00:12:04,505 --> 00:12:06,132
Me?

109
00:12:06,507 --> 00:12:09,476
Chintu! Up to mischief again?

110
00:12:10,511 --> 00:12:12,809
Tell her the truth, Krishna, else I shall.

111
00:12:13,181 --> 00:12:15,308
Sure, go ahead

112
00:12:16,317 --> 00:12:17,944
I'll tell her since you've asked me to

113
00:12:18,486 --> 00:12:21,944
Grandma, Krishna was running faster
than Toofan today

114
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:24,750
What? Faster than Toofan?

115
00:12:24,926 --> 00:12:27,053
So? What's the big deal?

116
00:12:27,295 --> 00:12:28,262
And how about that?

117
00:12:29,464 --> 00:12:30,089
What?

118
00:12:30,331 --> 00:12:33,266
You climbed the mountain faster
than the monkeys...

119
00:12:33,901 --> 00:12:37,860
Grandma, you know that tall
mountain by the temple?

120
00:12:38,139 --> 00:12:41,199
Krishna jumped from it
into the river.

121
00:12:41,909 --> 00:12:44,036
I thought it was all over.
But he came back!

122
00:12:45,313 --> 00:12:48,441
Krishna, why do you do such things?

123
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:53,410
I've forbidden you time and again!
Why do you still do such things?

124
00:12:53,654 --> 00:12:55,246
What do I do Grandma?
You tell me!

125
00:12:57,558 --> 00:12:59,355
How do I rid myself of loneliness?

126
00:13:00,561 --> 00:13:01,687
Who do I make friends with?

127
00:13:03,197 --> 00:13:06,360
Boys my age have gone away to the city,
to either study or earn a living

128
00:13:07,468 --> 00:13:09,698
And those that are here don't
want be friends with me

129
00:13:10,238 --> 00:13:13,207
They say... I'm not like them

130
00:13:18,479 --> 00:13:20,879
So I've made friends with
animals and birds

131
00:13:23,418 --> 00:13:25,886
Keep myself busy with nature.

132
00:13:27,588 --> 00:13:30,216
But even out here in the open,
I sometimes feel stifled

133
00:13:32,927 --> 00:13:36,727
I feel like running far away
from here.

134
00:13:39,934 --> 00:13:42,232
Will you leave me and go away?

135
00:13:46,207 --> 00:13:49,836
It's because of you that I don't go!
Else, I'd have left long ago

136
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,086
Krishna has grown up, Rohit

137
00:14:08,296 --> 00:14:13,928
I'm not sure how long I will be
able to hide him

138
00:14:16,537 --> 00:14:19,597
Where is Sonia Mehra and her
grandson Krishna, Father?

139
00:14:20,641 --> 00:14:25,101
It's the third time in so many years
that I've come to ask you

140
00:14:25,346 --> 00:14:27,610
And my answer is still the same.

141
00:14:28,983 --> 00:14:32,942
I have no idea where Mrs. Mehra is.
I really don't know!

142
00:14:33,988 --> 00:14:36,957
Why do you keep coming to me again
and again and waste my time?

143
00:14:37,892 --> 00:14:41,089
Because you are the last link to
Rohit Mehra's family...

144
00:14:41,496 --> 00:14:45,296
and you're the last person Sonia Mehra
met before she went missing

145
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,297
You know where they are,
but you're lying.

146
00:14:50,638 --> 00:14:51,434
What?

147
00:14:52,907 --> 00:14:54,704
You are lying, Father.

148
00:14:56,110 --> 00:15:00,171
When I asked you whether Krishna possessed
the powers Rohit had...

149
00:15:01,182 --> 00:15:02,581
you said he didn't.

150
00:15:03,451 --> 00:15:07,080
But I was told... that the son was
better than his father

151
00:15:07,989 --> 00:15:12,289
That he possesses all of Rohit's powers.
So tell me, Father...

152
00:15:12,627 --> 00:15:15,095
I'll pay any price you ask

153
00:15:15,363 --> 00:15:18,161
How dare you! Mr. Sinha,
this is a school!

154
00:15:18,866 --> 00:15:20,493
We don't indulge
in business here!

155
00:15:21,469 --> 00:15:23,061
Please leave now!

156
00:15:25,006 --> 00:15:29,136
You're making a mistake, Father.
A big mistake.

157
00:15:34,182 --> 00:15:35,649
Krishna! Look!

158
00:15:45,126 --> 00:15:46,252
What a huge kite!

159
00:15:46,794 --> 00:15:48,421
But where's the string?

160
00:15:48,796 --> 00:15:51,424
Must've snapped. Let's get it!

161
00:17:55,489 --> 00:17:58,117
Don't scream! You needn't be afraid

162
00:18:00,661 --> 00:18:04,461
Close your eyes and hold on to me tightly

163
00:18:22,516 --> 00:18:23,642
Stop screaming!

164
00:18:25,586 --> 00:18:26,985
Else, I'll drop you.

165
00:18:28,522 --> 00:18:29,489
Close your eyes

166
00:18:30,925 --> 00:18:33,155
Close your eyes, not widen them.

167
00:18:34,028 --> 00:18:34,995
Close them!

168
00:18:35,863 --> 00:18:36,830
Close!

169
00:18:56,217 --> 00:18:57,343
The glider came this way!

170
00:18:58,119 --> 00:18:59,518
There it is!

171
00:19:00,054 --> 00:19:01,180
Where?

172
00:19:02,223 --> 00:19:03,190
Up there!

173
00:19:05,226 --> 00:19:07,524
Oh my God! Where's Priya?

174
00:19:07,895 --> 00:19:08,691
There!

175
00:19:19,573 --> 00:19:22,371
She's breathing. She must've passed out

176
00:19:22,576 --> 00:19:24,840
Let's take her back to the camp

177
00:19:30,818 --> 00:19:35,380
The glider was at such a height,
Priya Ma'am was down here...

178
00:19:35,589 --> 00:19:38,717
...and she's still breathing?
Just imagine!

179
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:44,056
Just imagine.

180
00:19:44,298 --> 00:19:45,230
Imagine!

181
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:10,257
Where am I?

182
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:12,255
You're alive and you're with us

183
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,257
Thank God you're alive.

184
00:20:15,129 --> 00:20:18,257
Not God, it's that boy
we ought to thank

185
00:20:19,133 --> 00:20:21,601
That boy? Which boy?

186
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:25,434
The one who saved my life

187
00:20:26,807 --> 00:20:28,434
A boy saved you?

188
00:20:29,477 --> 00:20:30,774
But there was no one there

189
00:20:30,978 --> 00:20:34,778
No sir! He must've been there!
We fell from the tree together.

190
00:20:35,983 --> 00:20:39,441
Together? But you went
in the glider alone.

191
00:20:39,687 --> 00:20:42,451
How did he come on
the tree to rescue you?

192
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:44,448
Did he fall from the skies?

193
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:46,285
Yes sir. That's where he came from!

194
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,461
Priya, trust me, you were all alone. Right?

195
00:20:55,503 --> 00:20:56,299
Ghost!

196
00:20:56,504 --> 00:20:57,129
What happened?

197
00:20:58,172 --> 00:20:59,139
G-H-O-S-T!

198
00:21:01,709 --> 00:21:03,301
Komal sir, ghost!

199
00:21:04,345 --> 00:21:04,970
Ghost?

200
00:21:14,088 --> 00:21:15,385
What are you blabbering, Bahadur?

201
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:20,390
No blabber, sir. It's a chant.
To drive the ghost away.

202
00:21:20,594 --> 00:21:23,722
What rubbish, Bahadur?
Ghost in broad daylight?

203
00:21:23,998 --> 00:21:29,402
This is a jungle, sir! Night
and day are all the same here

204
00:21:29,603 --> 00:21:31,571
Priya Ma'am, was he tall?

205
00:21:31,772 --> 00:21:32,739
Yes

206
00:21:33,774 --> 00:21:34,900
Well built?

207
00:21:35,109 --> 00:21:36,076
Yes!

208
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:37,406
Fair-skinned?

209
00:21:37,611 --> 00:21:38,236
Yes!

210
00:21:38,612 --> 00:21:39,237
Kalicharan!

211
00:21:39,446 --> 00:21:40,242
Kalicharan?

212
00:21:41,482 --> 00:21:42,414
Kalicharan?

213
00:21:42,683 --> 00:21:45,413
Yes, sir! Kalicharan's ghost!

214
00:21:45,819 --> 00:21:49,255
Been wandering in the mountains
for ages... upside down on trees

215
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:50,752
Just imagine!

216
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:51,754
What nonsense!

217
00:21:52,826 --> 00:21:55,590
A ghost in our times?
I don't believe all this.

218
00:21:55,796 --> 00:21:57,263
I also don't believe all this!

219
00:21:59,466 --> 00:22:00,262
What happened?

220
00:22:00,634 --> 00:22:01,601
What happened?

221
00:22:02,303 --> 00:22:03,099
Relax...

222
00:22:07,141 --> 00:22:10,269
Sir, it's either a sprain or a fracture

223
00:22:10,477 --> 00:22:11,774
Oh no!

224
00:22:12,046 --> 00:22:14,105
We're here on a 10-day
adventure camp...

225
00:22:14,381 --> 00:22:16,941
...and you've already broken your foot!

226
00:22:17,484 --> 00:22:20,942
Honey, take her into the tent
and give her first-aid

227
00:22:21,488 --> 00:22:21,954
Careful...

228
00:22:28,596 --> 00:22:32,225
Bahadur, go to your phone booth
and call for a car

229
00:22:33,267 --> 00:22:35,235
We need to send Priya to
the city for treatment

230
00:22:35,836 --> 00:22:38,464
I'll go at night, sir.
I feel scared by day.

231
00:22:38,672 --> 00:22:39,468
What?

232
00:22:39,673 --> 00:22:41,470
Yes! Kalicharan's ghost.

233
00:22:41,675 --> 00:22:43,973
Scares people by day
and sleeps at night.

234
00:22:44,244 --> 00:22:45,142
Just imagine!

235
00:22:45,813 --> 00:22:46,780
Easy, easy

236
00:22:47,014 --> 00:22:49,141
Just relax. I'll organize a painkiller

237
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:50,647
C'mon guys. Let's go

238
00:23:13,807 --> 00:23:16,435
You're always screaming!
Doesn't your throat hurt?

239
00:23:17,811 --> 00:23:19,278
Your eyes are widening again!

240
00:23:24,485 --> 00:23:25,611
You must never get scared...

241
00:23:27,388 --> 00:23:29,117
What happened, Priya?
Why were you screaming?

242
00:23:29,323 --> 00:23:32,952
Honey, he was here! In this room!
He was here, Honey!

243
00:23:34,061 --> 00:23:35,460
Who? Who was here?

244
00:23:35,996 --> 00:23:37,964
The boy who saved me
on the tree...

245
00:23:38,165 --> 00:23:39,792
the one I told you about, sir...

246
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,627
God! What's happened to this girl?

247
00:23:43,837 --> 00:23:47,466
Priya, it's just 2 seconds since I left...

248
00:23:47,741 --> 00:23:51,142
Are you saying that someone came
and even went away in the meantime?

249
00:23:51,845 --> 00:23:53,642
You must've dozed off and
probably had a dream.

250
00:23:53,847 --> 00:23:57,305
I didn't dream! Why doesn't
someone believe me?

251
00:23:57,685 --> 00:24:00,313
The moment I closed my eyes,
he entered the tent...

252
00:24:00,521 --> 00:24:03,319
he twisted my ankle and the pain...

253
00:24:06,527 --> 00:24:08,654
Hey! The pain in my ankle is gone! See!

254
00:24:09,029 --> 00:24:10,496
The pain has disappeared!

255
00:24:11,432 --> 00:24:13,992
Oh my God sir! My foot is all right!

256
00:24:14,368 --> 00:24:17,166
Look at this... I can jump!

257
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:20,836
My foot has become all right

258
00:24:21,709 --> 00:24:25,008
Either this girl has really gone mad,
or she's conning us!

259
00:24:25,212 --> 00:24:30,343
No, sir! I'm not conning you! See...
I can jump! Believe me!

260
00:24:30,551 --> 00:24:34,681
I believe you! Kalicharan has
cured your foot

261
00:24:34,888 --> 00:24:35,650
Just imagine!

262
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:38,858
Kalicharan? So this ghost
is also a doctor?

263
00:24:39,059 --> 00:24:40,026
Not is, was!

264
00:24:40,227 --> 00:24:43,526
Kalicharan's father, Lalcharan.
Doctor Lalcharan.

265
00:24:44,898 --> 00:24:49,198
There's no Kalicharan, there's
no Lalcharan... it's a pack of lies!

266
00:24:49,737 --> 00:24:52,035
It's some stupid local boy
playing a prank on me

267
00:24:52,406 --> 00:24:55,204
I'm going to find him today,
bring him before everybody...

268
00:24:55,409 --> 00:24:57,536
and prove to them that he's
just another boy!

269
00:24:57,745 --> 00:24:58,370
Are you looking for someone?

270
00:24:58,579 --> 00:24:59,546
What?

271
00:25:01,482 --> 00:25:03,382
You! I'm looking for you!

272
00:25:04,651 --> 00:25:06,744
Where do you keep disappearing?

273
00:25:06,954 --> 00:25:09,650
Why don't you appear before others
as you appear before me?

274
00:25:09,757 --> 00:25:13,215
And that stupid Bahadur keeps telling
them that you're a ghost!

275
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:17,061
You... you're not Kalicharan, are you?

276
00:25:17,598 --> 00:25:18,895
You're human, aren't you?

277
00:25:24,104 --> 00:25:24,866
Why are you kids giggling?

278
00:25:25,172 --> 00:25:27,663
Who are you talking to, aunty?

279
00:25:28,008 --> 00:25:32,035
Aunty? Firstly you call me aunty and
then you ask who I am speaking to?

280
00:25:32,246 --> 00:25:33,713
I'm talking to this boy!

281
00:25:34,248 --> 00:25:35,215
Which Boy?

282
00:25:36,083 --> 00:25:39,382
Can't you see this boy here?

283
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,880
That's a lamppost there, not a Boy,

284
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:45,057
That's a boy

285
00:25:45,926 --> 00:25:46,722
Lamppost

286
00:25:46,927 --> 00:25:47,393
Boy!

287
00:25:47,594 --> 00:25:48,060
Lamppost!

288
00:25:48,262 --> 00:25:49,058
Shut up!

289
00:25:52,099 --> 00:25:53,726
One moment. Please Listen...

290
00:25:57,437 --> 00:26:00,235
What do you see there?
A boy? Or a lamppost?

291
00:26:01,108 --> 00:26:04,407
Well... there's neither a boy
there nor a lamppost.

292
00:26:04,611 --> 00:26:05,578
Look carefully...

293
00:26:12,686 --> 00:26:13,744
What happened?

294
00:26:15,355 --> 00:26:17,915
I'm feeling giddy.

295
00:26:18,358 --> 00:26:20,417
You seem unwell

296
00:26:20,761 --> 00:26:24,925
My house is nearby...
come rest there for a while

297
00:26:25,632 --> 00:26:26,599
I'll get you a glass of water

298
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,266
Okay!

299
00:26:35,943 --> 00:26:39,106
Why's his picture garlanded?

300
00:26:40,981 --> 00:26:45,941
My son. He died 20 years ago

301
00:26:48,989 --> 00:26:51,958
But how's that possible?
Moments ago, I...

302
00:27:14,548 --> 00:27:18,177
It's a tragic tale that took place
20 years ago

303
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,617
Champa and Kalicharan

304
00:27:22,322 --> 00:27:27,055
Kalicharan and Champa.
Madly in love with each other

305
00:27:27,327 --> 00:27:29,727
They were like one soul two bodies.

306
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:31,227
And then one day...

307
00:27:31,932 --> 00:27:32,728
What happened?

308
00:27:32,933 --> 00:27:36,061
Kalicharan was putting some flowers
in Champa's hair...

309
00:27:37,271 --> 00:27:39,239
Lalcharan happened to see them.

310
00:27:39,773 --> 00:27:42,401
He went red with rage!

311
00:27:42,943 --> 00:27:50,748
And one day, he deceived Champa into
drinking poison, in the name of medicine

312
00:27:50,951 --> 00:27:56,753
And poor Champa! She screamed,
"Kali, Kali..."

313
00:27:57,291 --> 00:28:01,091
...and died. Just imagine!

314
00:28:01,628 --> 00:28:06,759
Kalicharan just could not bear
the pain of Champa's death

315
00:28:07,801 --> 00:28:10,599
Over there! Look at that peak!

316
00:28:10,804 --> 00:28:18,267
From that very peak, Kalicharan
screamed, "Champa, Champa..."

317
00:28:18,478 --> 00:28:22,107
...and jumped to his death!

318
00:28:22,482 --> 00:28:29,479
Ever since, Kalicharan's spirit has
been looking for his Champa!

319
00:28:29,823 --> 00:28:33,281
Why're you pointing towards me?

320
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,958
Because you are his Champa

321
00:28:36,663 --> 00:28:38,460
Me? Champa!

322
00:28:38,999 --> 00:28:40,626
I mean, you look like Champa

323
00:28:42,402 --> 00:28:45,633
I'm feeling terribly scared. We can't
stay here anymore, please

324
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:47,136
Nobody goes anywhere!

325
00:28:49,209 --> 00:28:53,305
This silly Bahadur talks a lot of nonsense...

326
00:28:53,547 --> 00:28:55,139
...and you start imagining?

327
00:28:56,016 --> 00:29:00,976
Bahadur, you're not telling these kids
anymore stories. Understand?

328
00:29:03,023 --> 00:29:06,151
And now get ready. We're going
mountain-climbing

329
00:29:14,868 --> 00:29:16,836
You will use ascenders to climb...

330
00:29:18,438 --> 00:29:20,838
...descenders to come down.

331
00:29:21,108 --> 00:29:22,166
And you will come rappelling, down.

332
00:29:22,542 --> 00:29:23,668
'right sir. ok sir'

333
00:29:38,392 --> 00:29:39,518
Ghost!

334
00:29:42,062 --> 00:29:42,528
Priya!

335
00:30:04,084 --> 00:30:04,709
What... what on earth is that?

336
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,217
Kalicharan!

337
00:30:09,089 --> 00:30:10,215
Just imagine

338
00:30:11,425 --> 00:30:12,551
Can't imagine

339
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:18,728
Temperature. 104 degrees

340
00:30:19,499 --> 00:30:21,057
We had told you sir.

341
00:30:21,601 --> 00:30:23,728
But you didn't listen.

342
00:30:24,604 --> 00:30:25,571
Sorry, sorry

343
00:30:27,307 --> 00:30:29,275
We're not staying here any more

344
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:32,738
Bahadur, leave immediately.

345
00:30:32,946 --> 00:30:37,406
And arrange for
our transportation. Go!

346
00:30:39,186 --> 00:30:40,915
You've snatched my bread and butter.

347
00:30:41,121 --> 00:30:43,419
I'm broke even before I could
make some money.

348
00:30:43,623 --> 00:30:44,590
Just imagine!

349
00:30:45,192 --> 00:30:49,788
Why did you climb the mountain
like that, in front of them?

350
00:30:50,697 --> 00:30:53,598
What could I do? She screamed
so loudly...

351
00:30:54,801 --> 00:30:57,770
...that I got scared

352
00:30:58,138 --> 00:31:03,098
And now they are so scared,
that they're all going back.

353
00:31:03,577 --> 00:31:07,513
Now keep searching for your
Champa all your life!

354
00:31:08,715 --> 00:31:11,513
What do we do, Bahadur?

355
00:31:11,985 --> 00:31:15,614
How do I know? I did as you said

356
00:31:15,989 --> 00:31:17,456
You think of a way now

357
00:31:20,894 --> 00:31:21,792
Idea!

358
00:31:21,995 --> 00:31:22,461
What?

359
00:31:22,662 --> 00:31:23,458
Champa-ji...

360
00:31:28,168 --> 00:31:29,294
My name is Priya.

361
00:31:30,003 --> 00:31:31,300
In this lifetime

362
00:31:31,838 --> 00:31:35,797
In your earlier six births you were
Kalicharan's Champa

363
00:31:36,009 --> 00:31:37,476
This is your 7th birth.

364
00:31:37,677 --> 00:31:41,306
If you leave without meeting him,
he'll be very angry...

365
00:31:41,515 --> 00:31:44,643
And he'll follow you
wherever you go

366
00:31:44,918 --> 00:31:45,976
Just imagine!

367
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:50,479
How will he follow her?
We're going back to Singapore

368
00:31:50,724 --> 00:31:55,161
He can reach Singapore too!
He doesn't need air tickets

369
00:31:55,362 --> 00:31:59,162
Bahadur, she's not meeting any ghost!
What if something happens to her?

370
00:31:59,933 --> 00:32:04,495
This ghost is a gentleman, ma'am.
He hasn't harmed a soul

371
00:32:04,704 --> 00:32:05,329
Am I right?

372
00:32:05,939 --> 00:32:07,031
Yes

373
00:32:07,607 --> 00:32:10,007
I leave the rest to you

374
00:32:12,212 --> 00:32:13,008
Wait Bahadur!

375
00:32:16,383 --> 00:32:17,008
Honey...

376
00:32:17,217 --> 00:32:18,013
Yes?

377
00:32:18,885 --> 00:32:20,512
I think he's right

378
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,515
You're going to meet him?

379
00:32:22,822 --> 00:32:26,155
Yes. Only then will he find peace

380
00:32:26,426 --> 00:32:28,519
And you better not stop her

381
00:32:28,962 --> 00:32:33,661
if Kalicharan gets to know...
just imagine!

382
00:32:33,967 --> 00:32:35,696
No! I wasn't stopping her!

383
00:32:35,969 --> 00:32:39,029
I was only advising you, right?

384
00:32:39,406 --> 00:32:44,366
Listen, you must meet the ghost.
He's such a gentleman!

385
00:32:44,644 --> 00:32:46,043
I'm off to sleep.
Bye, good night!

386
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:57,055
Champa... Champa...

387
00:33:25,151 --> 00:33:28,746
Hello! Kalicharan ji...

388
00:33:29,456 --> 00:33:30,423
Here I am...

389
00:33:31,291 --> 00:33:33,589
...to help you get peace

390
00:33:33,793 --> 00:33:36,261
Please... could you appear
before me?

391
00:33:42,302 --> 00:33:44,270
"I feel scared"

392
00:33:45,305 --> 00:33:47,432
Do ghosts also feel
scared nowadays?

393
00:33:52,479 --> 00:33:54,913
"I'm not a ghost"

394
00:33:56,316 --> 00:33:58,113
You aren't a ghost?

395
00:33:59,653 --> 00:34:01,450
Oh yes, I get it...

396
00:34:02,322 --> 00:34:05,780
it offends you when someone calls
you a ghost, isn't it?

397
00:34:06,493 --> 00:34:11,453
And you're right! You've ended
your life for love

398
00:34:11,731 --> 00:34:16,293
And those who end their lives
for love aren't ghosts...

399
00:34:16,836 --> 00:34:19,464
They are... they are...

400
00:34:20,507 --> 00:34:23,635
They're lovers! You're
a lover, aren't you?

401
00:34:24,678 --> 00:34:25,474
I'm Krishna

402
00:34:36,923 --> 00:34:39,653
Look... stay right there!

403
00:34:39,926 --> 00:34:41,655
Don't come closer, okay?

404
00:34:42,028 --> 00:34:44,656
You sent for me
and here I am.

405
00:34:45,198 --> 00:34:46,995
You'll get peace now

406
00:34:47,534 --> 00:34:48,501
May I go now?

407
00:34:48,868 --> 00:34:51,496
All I want is friendship

408
00:34:52,539 --> 00:34:53,665
Friendship?

409
00:34:55,275 --> 00:34:59,006
Hey... don't be afraid.
I'm as human as you are

410
00:34:59,646 --> 00:35:02,308
Touch me if you can't
believe that.

411
00:35:02,949 --> 00:35:04,007
Touch you?

412
00:35:08,555 --> 00:35:09,351
I'm sorry

413
00:35:12,058 --> 00:35:14,356
See? The color of my blood
is red, too.

414
00:35:14,728 --> 00:35:16,355
Are you convinced now
that I'm not a ghost?

415
00:35:17,564 --> 00:35:21,193
If you're not a ghost then
that picture?

416
00:35:22,302 --> 00:35:26,534
That's my father's photograph.
He's no more

417
00:35:26,906 --> 00:35:28,203
I look exactly like him.

418
00:35:29,309 --> 00:35:29,866
I see

419
00:35:31,077 --> 00:35:35,537
But the other day, how did you suddenly
get on that tree to save my life?

420
00:35:36,316 --> 00:35:39,547
And yesterday! How did you climb
that mountain so fast?

421
00:35:41,254 --> 00:35:43,722
Maybe because I've got used to it

422
00:35:45,492 --> 00:35:50,293
Right from my childhood, I've grown up
playing among the trees and mountains...

423
00:35:50,563 --> 00:35:52,895
...with the birds and the animals.
I spend most of my time here

424
00:35:53,266 --> 00:35:55,291
I guess that's why they're my friends

425
00:35:56,603 --> 00:35:57,900
Would you like to
meet my friends?

426
00:36:17,123 --> 00:36:20,490
Wow! I still can't believe it!

427
00:36:21,461 --> 00:36:25,727
I won't let you poke that pin again!
It hurts because I'm not Kalicharan.

428
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:35,270
See? He's not Kalicharan!
I've always been saying that!

429
00:36:35,508 --> 00:36:37,271
That's what you're still saying.

430
00:36:42,282 --> 00:36:43,510
I'm Right!

431
00:36:46,953 --> 00:36:50,184
Kalicharan! You're so cute!

432
00:36:50,657 --> 00:36:55,287
Krishna, you really got us scared.
But that was a nice prank.

433
00:36:56,329 --> 00:36:59,628
Boys and girls,
camping continues!

434
00:37:00,333 --> 00:37:02,631
Krishna, you also join the group!

435
00:37:35,535 --> 00:37:36,331
Just imagine!

436
00:37:47,113 --> 00:37:48,341
C'mon! C'mon!

437
00:38:44,103 --> 00:38:45,070
Come

438
00:39:22,208 --> 00:39:24,608
From where are you getting a flower of
a new color every time, Krishna?

439
00:39:24,811 --> 00:39:25,937
From the rainbow.

440
00:39:26,813 --> 00:39:28,610
The rainbow?

441
00:39:28,982 --> 00:39:29,949
Yes

442
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:32,276
Look

443
00:39:45,498 --> 00:39:49,298
Wow Krishna! It's such
a beautiful sight

444
00:39:51,004 --> 00:39:54,963
Had I not come here, I'd really
have regretted it

445
00:39:56,576 --> 00:39:57,634
So would I

446
00:40:02,248 --> 00:40:04,478
I've never seen such a lovely place.

447
00:40:06,252 --> 00:40:12,487
It's so beautiful. So pure,
so serene, so quiet

448
00:40:13,693 --> 00:40:15,160
You should see this place in autumn.

449
00:40:16,262 --> 00:40:17,661
It's a riot of colors

450
00:40:18,598 --> 00:40:22,500
When the sunrays touch the
fallen leaves, everything turns to gold

451
00:40:23,036 --> 00:40:24,162
It's so beautiful

452
00:40:25,204 --> 00:40:27,866
Makes you realize what
a great artist God really is

453
00:40:28,775 --> 00:40:32,074
Krishna, you speak English?

454
00:40:32,712 --> 00:40:34,179
And with such fluency?

455
00:40:35,214 --> 00:40:40,516
Grandma taught me. She's my
school, my college and my university

456
00:40:41,054 --> 00:40:45,013
But you need talent to
learn anything, Krishna

457
00:40:45,224 --> 00:40:46,851
And you possess amazing talent.

458
00:40:47,226 --> 00:40:48,352
You're amazing!

459
00:40:49,295 --> 00:40:52,696
You shouldn't be wasting your
talent in this remote village

460
00:40:52,899 --> 00:40:54,696
You ought to get out of here.

461
00:40:55,068 --> 00:40:56,695
People in the world out there...

462
00:40:56,903 --> 00:41:00,532
...not just need talented people
like you, they appreciate them too

463
00:41:02,909 --> 00:41:05,207
But my grandma is my world

464
00:41:06,412 --> 00:41:09,210
I will never leave her.

465
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:12,877
You love your grandma
very much?

466
00:41:13,886 --> 00:41:15,285
More than very much

467
00:41:15,421 --> 00:41:17,821
Krishna, I want to meet
your grandma

468

"And there are those wonderful people
who never leave your heart"

487
00:44:52,138 --> 00:44:57,098
"Everybody understands the
language of the heart"

488
00:44:57,310 --> 00:45:02,612
"it connects even with strangers,"

489
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:15,625
"Dusk seems to be saying
something to you and me..."

490
00:45:15,828 --> 00:45:20,288
"secretly, quietly"

491
00:45:34,747 --> 00:45:44,713
ADLABS

492
00:45:57,536 --> 00:45:59,333
Grandma... this is Priya.

493
00:45:59,538 --> 00:46:01,335
Hello, Grandma

494
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:02,837
We've met before.

495
00:46:03,175 --> 00:46:05,336
I remember. Tell me something...

496
00:46:05,845 --> 00:46:08,313
Why did you go away, the other day?

497
00:46:08,614 --> 00:46:10,514
I fled, grandma! Out of fright

498
00:46:10,850 --> 00:46:13,910
Krishna was playing a ghost
to scare us

499
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:15,087
Ghost?

500
00:46:20,926 --> 00:46:25,260
And that well-built Komal Sir
was trembling in his boots!

501
00:46:25,431 --> 00:46:28,229
He was down with 104 degrees fever!

502
00:46:29,068 --> 00:46:30,035
What? 104 degrees?

503
00:46:30,770 --> 00:46:31,862
Is that true, Krishna?

504
00:46:32,805 --> 00:46:35,069
You shouldn't play such pranks
on anyone, my son

505
00:46:35,408 --> 00:46:36,898
Why scare someone so much?

506
00:46:37,176 --> 00:46:40,873
Did you apologize?

507
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:43,378
Yes, Grandma. To everybody

508
00:46:51,724 --> 00:46:56,491
Priya... tell me something about yourself

509
00:46:57,329 --> 00:46:59,957
I live in Singapore with my Mother.

510
00:47:00,966 --> 00:47:02,433
My father is no more

511
00:47:03,035 --> 00:47:05,299
I'm here in India on a vacation
with my friend...

512
00:47:05,504 --> 00:47:06,994
Her family lives in Chandigarh

513
00:47:07,206 --> 00:47:08,195
I see

514
00:47:08,941 --> 00:47:10,704
I'll go and wash my hands

515
00:47:41,507 --> 00:47:45,603
Priya, for how many more days
are you here?

516
00:47:45,811 --> 00:47:48,336
Days? we're leaving today.

517
00:47:48,814 --> 00:47:49,781
In fact, right now

518
00:47:50,583 --> 00:47:52,642
Oh my God! I must leave now.

519
00:47:52,852 --> 00:47:54,615
Everyone must be waiting for me.

520
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:57,345
Here's my phone number.

521
00:47:57,556 --> 00:47:59,524
Whenever you come here again...

522
00:47:59,725 --> 00:48:03,126
...please give me the opportunity
to serve you again

523
00:48:03,329 --> 00:48:03,954
Where's Priya?

524
00:48:04,163 --> 00:48:04,993
There she is!

525
00:48:05,197 --> 00:48:06,459
Hurry, we've got to leave.

526
00:48:06,732 --> 00:48:08,029
C'mon, everybody! Get in!

527
00:48:08,334 --> 00:48:10,234
Nice meeting you.

528
00:48:11,270 --> 00:48:13,033
we really enjoyed your
company, Krishna.

529
00:48:13,239 --> 00:48:14,467
We'd love to come back.

530
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:16,273
It was great fun, Krishna.

531
00:48:21,514 --> 00:48:22,572
Thanks, Krishna!

532
00:48:23,182 --> 00:48:24,979
I had a wonderful time with you.

533
00:48:25,885 --> 00:48:28,911
I didn't even realize how ten days
have passed by

534
00:48:29,321 --> 00:48:30,117
Really!

535
00:48:30,856 --> 00:48:32,585
I'm going to miss this place...

536
00:48:34,193 --> 00:48:35,387
And you, too.

537
00:48:37,062 --> 00:48:38,723
Look after yourself, Kalicharan.

538
00:48:40,533 --> 00:48:41,830
I have to go now.

539
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:45,137
May I?

540
00:48:48,874 --> 00:48:49,841
May I go?

541
00:48:53,045 --> 00:48:57,038
Krishna, how will she go,
if you don't leave her hand?

542
00:49:01,687 --> 00:49:02,745
Bye, Krishna

543
00:49:03,923 --> 00:49:04,719
Bye

544
00:49:23,876 --> 00:49:26,606
Priya... See!

545
00:50:00,913 --> 00:50:03,677
Looks like you're no longer Priya.
You've become Radha.

546
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:06,212
Krishna's Radha.

547
00:50:08,187 --> 00:50:08,915
What?

548
00:50:09,722 --> 00:50:14,352
I seriously think Krishna has
fallen in love with you.

549
00:50:21,133 --> 00:50:22,327
I hope not...

550
00:50:50,896 --> 00:50:54,923
Honey, pray that the boss' mood is ok,
we're five days late.

551
00:51:02,908 --> 00:51:04,466
Hi! Honey. Hi! Priya

552
00:51:06,845 --> 00:51:08,369
We are saying hi to them,

553
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:10,013
Why're they waving five fingers at us?

554
00:51:10,215 --> 00:51:12,809
Stupid! The five fingers
stand for five days.

555
00:51:13,018 --> 00:51:14,986
Oh my God! You mean boss too...

556
00:51:20,025 --> 00:51:21,788
You took a leave of 15 days...

557
00:51:22,127 --> 00:51:23,754
...and have come after 20!

558
00:51:24,296 --> 00:51:27,322
So you girls are now fired!

559
00:51:28,334 --> 00:51:32,031
Why just India?
Go on a world tour! Go!

560
00:51:35,774 --> 00:51:36,638
Stop, Priya.

561
00:51:38,043 --> 00:51:41,069
Sorry boss, but you can't insult us.

562
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:42,972
Yeah?

563
00:51:43,215 --> 00:51:44,045
Yeah!

564
00:51:44,350 --> 00:51:49,686
Boss, you can't question
our integrity.

565
00:51:49,888 --> 00:51:51,822
Agreed we were on a leave
of 15 days

566
00:51:52,024 --> 00:51:56,120
But on the 16th day we got to work

567
00:51:57,129 --> 00:51:59,097
What amazing work have you done?

568
00:51:59,298 --> 00:52:02,199
We have found an Indian superboy.

569
00:52:02,401 --> 00:52:04,028
Honey! What are you saying?

570
00:52:04,236 --> 00:52:05,794
Let me speak, please.

571
00:52:06,138 --> 00:52:11,599
Boss, this boy scales high mountains
as if they were mere steps for him!

572
00:52:11,910 --> 00:52:13,639
He runs faster than a horse!

573
00:52:13,912 --> 00:52:14,810
And guess what?

574
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:17,548
He puts his hand in the river
and pulls out fish!

575
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:25,882
Just think of it, if a boy as talented
as him were to come here...

576
00:52:26,592 --> 00:52:30,551
...your rating's are going to soar!
Just imagine!

577
00:52:32,931 --> 00:52:37,231
I hope you're not trying to make
a fool out of me?

578
00:52:37,936 --> 00:52:42,396
No way, boss!
You will believe it too...

579
00:52:42,608 --> 00:52:47,045
...when you see him doing all those
incredible things here!

580
00:52:47,246 --> 00:52:51,080
See him here! How? How's he going
to come here?

581
00:52:52,017 --> 00:52:55,077
I tried to stop you, but you just
wouldn't listen!

582
00:52:55,754 --> 00:53:01,158
Please, Priya! There was no other way
of saving our job.

583
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:04,796
Besides, what's wrong if Krishna
comes here?

584
00:53:04,997 --> 00:53:06,760
There you go again!

585
00:53:06,965 --> 00:53:08,762
Relax! Sit down

586
00:53:09,067 --> 00:53:13,504
If Krishna's talents are
showcased on our channel...

587
00:53:13,705 --> 00:53:16,868
...he'd be the one who'd gain.
Name, fame, money...

588
00:53:17,075 --> 00:53:20,670
He'll have everything!
He'll be a big man!

589
00:53:20,879 --> 00:53:22,005
Just think!

590
00:53:25,083 --> 00:53:26,744
I know you're right, Honey...

591
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:30,818
...but Krishna will never leave
his grandma and come.

592
00:53:32,157 --> 00:53:33,749
She is his world.

593
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:37,629
But now you are a part
of his world too.

594
00:53:39,164 --> 00:53:44,295
I know. Now do as I say.

595
00:53:44,503 --> 00:53:46,903
Call for Krishna!

596
00:53:48,507 --> 00:53:49,804
Phone...

597
00:53:51,076 --> 00:53:52,407
Phone...

598
00:53:54,346 --> 00:53:56,814
Krishna, phone

599
00:53:59,218 --> 00:54:00,378
He's coming!

600
00:54:00,886 --> 00:54:01,818
Who's coming?

601
00:54:02,187 --> 00:54:06,419
A boy? Is he an Indian?
Does he live here in Singapore?

602
00:54:06,758 --> 00:54:08,658
Have you finally chosen
someone, Priya?

603
00:54:08,861 --> 00:54:11,557
There you go again, Mom!
I haven't chosen anyone

604
00:54:11,763 --> 00:54:12,855
So choose one!

605
00:54:13,065 --> 00:54:13,724
I will...

606
00:54:13,932 --> 00:54:16,059
...please leave now,
we got to save our jobs.

607
00:54:16,268 --> 00:54:17,064
And when will you settle down?

608
00:54:17,269 --> 00:54:17,860
Tomorrow

609
00:54:18,070 --> 00:54:19,435
Call from Priya!

610
00:54:20,138 --> 00:54:20,934
Priya?

611
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:22,668
Hello, Krishna...

612
00:54:22,875 --> 00:54:23,569
Priya...

613
00:54:25,210 --> 00:54:26,074
How are you?

614
00:54:26,778 --> 00:54:29,508
I'm fine, but I don't like anything

615
00:54:30,782 --> 00:54:31,680
Me too

616
00:54:33,218 --> 00:54:34,742
I can't sleep

617
00:54:36,154 --> 00:54:36,916
Me too

618
00:54:38,690 --> 00:54:40,248
I want to meet you

619
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:43,084
Me too

620
00:54:44,263 --> 00:54:46,993
He's not saying anything more than
"Me too", so what do I do?

621
00:54:47,199 --> 00:54:49,292
You continue reading,
read from here!

622
00:54:50,302 --> 00:54:51,997
Priya, why are you quiet?

623
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:56,198
Krishna, can't you come here
and meet my mother?

624
00:54:56,642 --> 00:54:57,472
Your mother?

625
00:54:57,676 --> 00:55:00,702
Yes, if you don't meet my mother...

626
00:55:00,913 --> 00:55:03,643
...she'll get me married to
someone else.

627
00:55:04,917 --> 00:55:05,884
Someone else?

628
00:55:06,485 --> 00:55:08,544
No, I won't let that happen!

629
00:55:08,754 --> 00:55:11,188
I'm coming there, Priya!

630
00:55:12,791 --> 00:55:17,125
But... how will I get there?

631
00:55:18,030 --> 00:55:20,123
Yes... how will you get here?

632
00:55:21,099 --> 00:55:24,865
Hello, Krishna! Don't worry.
Just give the phone to Bahadur?

633
00:55:39,418 --> 00:55:45,254
Krishna! Aircraft! Singapore!
Priya Ma'am!

634
00:55:45,457 --> 00:55:47,288
How? When?

635
00:55:52,197 --> 00:55:54,165
Just imagine!

636
00:55:58,103 --> 00:56:08,069
ADLABS

637
00:56:14,953 --> 00:56:18,753
"Come, let me tell you
a love story"

638
00:56:20,926 --> 00:56:24,953
"There was a boy and
there was a girl..."

639
00:56:50,389 --> 00:56:53,085
"She smiled"

640
00:56:53,291 --> 00:56:56,260
"He smiled"

641
00:56:56,461 --> 00:57:02,661
"Little did they know what
was happening"

642
00:57:24,456 --> 00:57:34,422
ADLABS

643
00:57:50,315 --> 00:57:56,185
"What they couldn't say till then,
they started saying..."

644
00:57:56,388 --> 00:58:03,317
"what they couldn't hear till then
they started hearing"

645
00:58:11,837 --> 00:58:21,803
ADLABS

646
00:58:23,548 --> 00:58:36,723
"It brings a smile to my face to
see us falling in love..."

647
00:58:38,497 --> 00:58:41,830
"We're lost in love"

648
00:58:44,903 --> 00:58:49,101
"The world didn't matter to them
anymore"

649
00:58:50,976 --> 00:58:55,174
"There was a boy
and there was a girl..."

650
00:58:56,948 --> 00:59:02,284
"she smiled, he smiled..."

651
00:59:02,487 --> 00:59:08,858
"little did they know what
was happening"

652
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:13,394
"Come, let me tell you a love story"

653
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:19,960
"There was a boy and there was a girl..."

654
00:59:32,551 --> 00:59:38,217
"There was no yearning,
there was no aching..."

655
00:59:38,423 --> 00:59:45,056
"they came together...
their hearts skipped a beat"

656
00:59:50,535 --> 00:59:56,269
"There was no yearning,
there was no aching..."

657
00:59:56,474 --> 01:00:03,346
"they came together... their hearts
skipped a beat"

658
01:00:05,717 --> 01:00:11,417
"What was destined happened..."

659
01:00:11,623 --> 01:00:19,530
"They got lost in love"

660
01:00:20,565 --> 01:00:24,057
"They got lost in love"

661
01:00:27,172 --> 01:00:31,199
"Oh, how one heart ruled the other!"

662
01:00:33,011 --> 01:00:37,744
"There was a boy and there was a girl..."

663
01:00:46,424 --> 01:00:46,947
Grandma!

664
01:00:47,158 --> 01:00:48,216
I am here

665
01:00:48,426 --> 01:00:49,893
Grandma!

666
01:00:51,096 --> 01:00:53,223
Grandma!

667
01:00:53,431 --> 01:00:54,227
Put me down

668
01:00:57,335 --> 01:00:58,461
What's the matter, Krishna?

669
01:00:59,271 --> 01:01:00,636
You look very happy today.

670
01:01:01,273 --> 01:01:03,400
Grandma, I got a call from Priya!

671
01:01:03,775 --> 01:01:05,743
You told me that she'd forget me?

672
01:01:06,111 --> 01:01:08,909
But it's not true, Grandma!
She misses me every moment.

673
01:01:09,114 --> 01:01:12,242
She's always thinking of me!
And she keeps seeing me everywhere!

674
01:01:14,786 --> 01:01:17,755
And I never told you...

675
01:01:20,659 --> 01:01:22,092
...I've been in a similar state.

676
01:01:23,628 --> 01:01:26,654
Ever since Priya has left,
I never liked anything.

677
01:01:28,566 --> 01:01:32,093
But today with her call,
I feel better.

678
01:01:32,904 --> 01:01:35,270
Grandma, Priya has called me
to Singapore

679
01:01:35,473 --> 01:01:36,940
She wants me to meet her mother.

680
01:01:37,475 --> 01:01:38,100
Her mother?

681
01:01:38,310 --> 01:01:38,935
Yes

682
01:01:39,144 --> 01:01:39,940
If I don't go and ask for her hand...

683
01:01:40,145 --> 01:01:42,943
...her mother's going to get her
married to someone else

684
01:01:44,316 --> 01:01:46,443
I said I wouldn't let that happen,
I'm coming.

685
01:01:48,386 --> 01:01:51,287
I did the right thing, didn't I Grandma?
May I go, Grandma?

686
01:01:58,496 --> 01:02:00,123
It's only a matter of a few days, grandma

687
01:02:00,332 --> 01:02:03,631
I'll ask for Priya's hand in marriage
and bring her back with me

688
01:02:06,171 --> 01:02:07,229
May I go, Grandma?

689
01:02:12,010 --> 01:02:13,534
You're not answering, Grandma

690
01:02:16,281 --> 01:02:18,806
When you've already decided to go...

691
01:02:20,085 --> 01:02:22,212
...why ask me?

692
01:02:23,188 --> 01:02:25,986
Go on. Go.

693
01:02:26,958 --> 01:02:28,152
You aren't happy, Grandma?

694
01:02:29,461 --> 01:02:31,827
Don't you like Priya?

695
01:02:33,631 --> 01:02:34,825
I like Priya...

696
01:02:36,368 --> 01:02:38,734
...but I don't like the idea
of you going so far.

697
01:02:40,205 --> 01:02:42,264
If Priya really loves you...

698
01:02:43,208 --> 01:02:45,836
...she can also come here
with her mother

699
01:02:47,045 --> 01:02:48,569
But you're not going there!

700
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:50,111
Why not?

701
01:02:51,649 --> 01:02:55,517
I said you're not going,
it means you're not going

702
01:02:57,555 --> 01:02:58,180
That's it!

703
01:02:58,556 --> 01:03:01,354
But why can't I go?
What's going to happen?

704
01:03:02,227 --> 01:03:03,353
I've been hearing this since I was a child!

705
01:03:03,561 --> 01:03:06,189
Don't go here, don't go there,
don't do this, don't do that...

706
01:03:06,398 --> 01:03:07,865
...don't go to the city with your friends!

707
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:11,196
Forget the city, you don't even
allow me to go beyond the river...

708
01:03:11,436 --> 01:03:12,130
Why?

709
01:03:15,407 --> 01:03:20,640
Now you've become so big that
I have to give explanations to you?

710
01:03:25,417 --> 01:03:27,044
You'll have to tell today, Grandma!

711
01:03:28,253 --> 01:03:29,447
Why do you keep stopping me?

712
01:03:29,921 --> 01:03:31,115
Why can't I go anywhere?

713
01:03:33,425 --> 01:03:36,724
Because I don't want to lose you

714
01:03:37,762 --> 01:03:39,059
So what do you want then?

715
01:03:39,431 --> 01:03:42,798
Cut me off from the world and
keep looking at your face forever?

716
01:03:43,334 --> 01:03:45,234
Bang my head on trees
and mountains all my life?

717
01:03:45,437 --> 01:03:47,735
You want me to be alone all my life?
Is that what you want?

718
01:03:55,113 --> 01:03:58,742
But I can't do I that, Grandma!
I have my own life too...

719
01:03:59,117 --> 01:04:02,416
...my own dreams. I too want to
achieve something!

720
01:04:02,620 --> 01:04:04,087
I want an identity for myself!

721
01:04:08,526 --> 01:04:12,428
You don't want to lose me,
even if I have to lose Priya

722
01:04:13,631 --> 01:04:15,758
You can't see me happy

723
01:04:17,302 --> 01:04:21,762
I have always obeyed you.
And you can't agree to my one request?

724
01:04:23,141 --> 01:04:25,439
Today I realize, how selfish you are!

725
01:04:26,978 --> 01:04:29,947
You only think of yourself!
Only yourself!

726
01:04:30,982 --> 01:04:32,950
You don't care for me!

727
01:04:33,651 --> 01:04:37,280
Had my parents been alive,
they'd have understood my feelings!

728
01:04:37,489 --> 01:04:39,457
They'd have let me go,
they wouldn't have stopped me!

729
01:04:49,934 --> 01:04:52,630
I wish your parents were alive.

730
01:04:54,672 --> 01:04:55,969
I wish!

731
01:05:24,702 --> 01:05:25,566
I'm sorry, Grandma.

732
01:05:37,282 --> 01:05:39,341
See these stars, Krishna...

733
01:05:42,353 --> 01:05:47,120
...with these infinite
twinkling stars in the sky...

734
01:05:47,992 --> 01:05:53,953
...you, your father, your grandfather...

735
01:05:54,165 --> 01:05:56,099
...and I share a very deep relationship.

736
01:05:59,237 --> 01:06:01,535
Your grandfather was a space scientist

737
01:06:02,674 --> 01:06:09,102
One night, he started receiving a reply
to a signal he had sent to outer space

738
01:06:09,847 --> 01:06:11,940
Suddenly, we saw a flying saucer in the sky...

739
01:06:12,150 --> 01:06:14,209
...the car swerved out of control

740
01:06:14,419 --> 01:06:17,217
I survived the accident...

741
01:06:17,589 --> 01:06:18,886
...but your grandfather.

742
01:06:24,929 --> 01:06:26,954
I was pregnant with Rohit at that time...

743
01:06:28,866 --> 01:06:31,391
...he had sustained a head injury
in the accident...

744
01:06:32,604 --> 01:06:34,731
...because of which he was born abnormal.

745
01:06:36,207 --> 01:06:41,076
...even when he grew up,
he had the I.Q. of a child.

746
01:06:42,180 --> 01:06:47,083
One night, in our small town,
a huge spaceship descended.

747
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:51,579
Some Aliens emerged from it...

748
01:06:52,290 --> 01:06:54,588
...but one could not go back.

749
01:06:55,627 --> 01:06:59,427
And that is how Rohit met Jadoo.

750
01:07:00,798 --> 01:07:04,097
Jadoo had supernatural powers...

751
01:07:05,370 --> 01:07:08,271
...which he passed on to Rohit.

752
01:07:09,374 --> 01:07:11,365
Rohit changed completely.

753
01:07:12,910 --> 01:07:14,434
Jadoo eventually went away...

754
01:07:15,980 --> 01:07:20,883
...but he did not take back the powers
he had given to Rohit.

755
01:07:22,153 --> 01:07:26,954
And thereafter, everything changed forever.

756
01:07:28,326 --> 01:07:35,232
My son could do things that were impossible
for an ordinary human being.

757
01:07:38,503 --> 01:07:41,165
It was around then that Rohit
married your mother.

758
01:07:42,607 --> 01:07:48,045
And very soon, his fame spread
across the world.

759
01:07:49,681 --> 01:07:53,811
The chairman of the world's largest
Information Technology Company...

760
01:07:54,852 --> 01:07:56,649
...invited Rohit abroad.

761
01:08:05,196 --> 01:08:05,821
Thank You.

762
01:08:12,804 --> 01:08:14,101
Welcome to Technotronics.

763
01:08:15,206 --> 01:08:16,002
Come with me, Sir

764
01:08:25,550 --> 01:08:27,177
Dr. Arya shall be here shortly

765
01:08:45,737 --> 01:08:47,136
Mr. Rohit Mehra?

766
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:50,867
I'm sorry to keep you waiting

767
01:08:51,576 --> 01:08:52,543
It's all right, Sir.

768
01:08:52,910 --> 01:08:53,877
I was, this book...

769
01:08:54,078 --> 01:08:59,710
Oh yes, that's the first copy of
my latest book.

770
01:09:00,151 --> 01:09:02,119
Please read it and give your opinion.

771
01:09:02,587 --> 01:09:05,454
It's a wonderful book, Sir.
You've done a lot of research.

772
01:09:06,257 --> 01:09:08,725
How can you say that without reading it?

773
01:09:08,926 --> 01:09:09,984
I've already read it, Sir.

774
01:09:12,096 --> 01:09:13,063
Read it?

775
01:09:14,932 --> 01:09:18,868
There are printing errors on
page 126, 244 and 354

776
01:09:19,504 --> 01:09:20,402
I've marked them.

777
01:09:21,172 --> 01:09:25,802
You've read this 400 page book
in just 10 minutes?

778
01:09:29,781 --> 01:09:32,341
I forgot who I was talking to.

779
01:09:32,483 --> 01:09:36,579
Asking you such questions is
an insult to your talent.

780
01:09:37,522 --> 01:09:39,251
It's an honor to meet you.

781
01:09:40,458 --> 01:09:41,686
The honor is mine, Sir.

782
01:09:43,060 --> 01:09:44,254
I still can't believe...

783
01:09:44,629 --> 01:09:47,427
...that I'm standing face to face with a
great scientist and innovator like you.

784
01:09:48,299 --> 01:09:50,267
Your achievements in the field of
wireless communication...

785
01:09:50,468 --> 01:09:52,265
...is no less than a revolution, Sir.

786
01:09:52,703 --> 01:09:55,900
You've invented the palmtop.

787
01:09:56,507 --> 01:10:00,671
People can watch cricket matches
on their phones, thanks to you.

788
01:10:04,148 --> 01:10:08,278
I have a new dream, Rohit. A new vision...

789
01:10:09,153 --> 01:10:17,060
...lf this dream comes true, it could change
the destiny of the world.

790
01:10:18,496 --> 01:10:22,125
And I need your help to realize this dream.

791
01:10:23,835 --> 01:10:29,467
I want to build a computer
that can see the future.

792
01:10:29,674 --> 01:10:31,073
That can see the future.

793
01:10:34,078 --> 01:10:34,806
Future?

794
01:10:37,248 --> 01:10:38,715
What would you like, tea or coffee?

795
01:10:47,425 --> 01:10:50,656
I understand your dream, your vision, Sir.

796
01:10:52,463 --> 01:10:56,991
You want to combine astrology,
astronomy and technology...

797
01:10:57,468 --> 01:11:00,995
...to build a computer that can see the future.

798
01:11:01,205 --> 01:11:04,902
Exactly! That's precisely
why I've called you here.

799
01:11:05,776 --> 01:11:09,337
Because the people I have here are trained...

800
01:11:10,481 --> 01:11:12,346
...not gifted like you.

801
01:11:26,831 --> 01:11:28,196
What are you thinking, Rohit?

802
01:11:29,967 --> 01:11:37,464
Sir, if we can really build a computer
that can see the future then...

803
01:11:37,675 --> 01:11:43,545
Then, think of the good we can do
for this planet and mankind!

804
01:11:43,748 --> 01:11:45,045
Wars can be prevented

805
01:11:45,249 --> 01:11:49,310
Earthquakes, famines, floods,
can be prevented.

806
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:52,387
Even if we can't prevent them,
we can at least be prepared for them.

807
01:11:52,590 --> 01:11:55,718
You've already started
seeing the future, Rohit.

808
01:11:56,761 --> 01:11:57,557
Welcome!

809
01:11:58,429 --> 01:12:04,390
In the hope that this union of brilliance
and vision will become history.

810
01:12:05,269 --> 01:12:06,736
Create history!

811
01:12:10,541 --> 01:12:12,304
It took him two whole years...

812
01:12:13,978 --> 01:12:18,074
...but Rohit achieved the impossible...

813
01:12:19,617 --> 01:12:24,418
...he built a computer
that could see the future...

814
01:12:27,224 --> 01:12:30,751
...It was around the time
when you were going to be born.

815
01:12:31,128 --> 01:12:33,756
Hello? - Mom?

816
01:12:33,965 --> 01:12:35,592
Rohit, I've brought Nisha to the hospital.

817
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:36,926
That's where I'm calling from.

818
01:12:37,234 --> 01:12:40,203
Congratulations! You're going to
become a father anytime.

819
01:12:42,039 --> 01:12:43,666
Come back soon.

820
01:12:43,874 --> 01:12:45,933
I'm coming, Mom... I'm coming!

821
01:12:47,979 --> 01:12:52,939
Rohit? What's the matter?
You sound tense.

822
01:12:53,217 --> 01:12:57,278
I've been exploited. The world is very selfish

823
01:12:57,655 --> 01:13:01,022
But don't worry! I'll be back soon!

824
01:13:02,326 --> 01:13:04,453
But my son did not come back.

825
01:13:07,231 --> 01:13:11,691
Moments after you were born,
we received word

826
01:13:14,105 --> 01:13:16,300
...that a fire broke out in the lab...

827
01:13:18,275 --> 01:13:23,303
...and they couldn't save Rohit.

828
01:13:27,118 --> 01:13:29,643
Your mother couldn't bear the shock...

829
01:13:30,788 --> 01:13:34,246
...and passed away in a few days.

830
01:13:38,029 --> 01:13:39,656
When you were five years old...

831
01:13:41,866 --> 01:13:46,667
...I got to know that you too were
born with extraordinary powers...

832
01:13:47,104 --> 01:13:51,507
...that Rohit had. I got scared.

833
01:13:52,877 --> 01:14:00,682
I didn't want the world to know about you.

834
01:14:01,652 --> 01:14:04,621
And that's why I brought you here...

835
01:14:05,556 --> 01:14:07,183
...a place where nobody knew us.

836
01:14:09,393 --> 01:14:13,853
I didn't want to lose you at any cost, Krishna.

837
01:14:17,768 --> 01:14:19,793
You no longer want to see my face...

838
01:14:22,740 --> 01:14:26,198
...but I'm living only for you, Krishna

839
01:14:30,347 --> 01:14:35,649
Yes, I'm selfish, very selfish.

840
01:15:12,790 --> 01:15:14,314
Grandma? What are you doing?

841
01:15:15,726 --> 01:15:18,092
I've taken out some of
your father's clothes.

842
01:15:19,296 --> 01:15:22,424
You can't go to Singapore like this!

843
01:15:25,803 --> 01:15:28,101
But Grandma?

844
01:15:31,809 --> 01:15:33,936
I could shield you from the world...

845
01:15:35,146 --> 01:15:36,670
...but not your heart.

846
01:15:37,815 --> 01:15:42,115
Go, bring Priya here.

847
01:15:46,157 --> 01:15:47,385
Krishna...

848
01:15:50,494 --> 01:15:52,052
...stay carefully there

849
01:15:52,830 --> 01:15:57,790
Eat and sleep on time,
don't talk too much with anybody.

850
01:15:58,669 --> 01:16:00,466
And don't get into any trouble...

851
01:16:01,405 --> 01:16:05,603
...whatever you do, make sure you
behave like any other man.

852
01:16:07,011 --> 01:16:12,574
Don't get carried away to do things
that make people realize...

853
01:16:14,618 --> 01:16:17,644
Who I am? Right, Grandma?

854
01:16:19,256 --> 01:16:20,154
Yes, my son.

855
01:16:21,525 --> 01:16:23,493
Don't worry, Grandma.

856
01:16:24,461 --> 01:16:26,827
I won't let anybody know about me.

857
01:16:27,798 --> 01:16:33,498
I'll keep my strength, my abilities
and my talent... hidden.

858
01:16:37,541 --> 01:16:39,008
That's a promise, Grandma.

859
01:17:09,573 --> 01:17:11,541
Welcome to Singapore, Sir.
- Thank you.

860
01:17:12,409 --> 01:17:16,709
Your welcome sounds different...
and nicer, today.

861
01:18:02,459 --> 01:18:03,084
Good afternoon, sir.

862
01:18:03,294 --> 01:18:05,091
A very good afternoon, Dr. Mathur.

863
01:18:08,132 --> 01:18:10,430
But sir...
- Yes, yes, I know...

864
01:18:10,634 --> 01:18:14,661
I've come a few days in advance.
But I couldn't help it.

865
01:18:14,872 --> 01:18:15,861
I've waited so many years...

866
01:18:16,073 --> 01:18:18,701
...but now that we're so close to success...

867
01:18:18,976 --> 01:18:23,106
...being patient is very difficult.

868
01:18:23,647 --> 01:18:26,616
Must say you and your team deserve credit...

869
01:18:26,817 --> 01:18:29,615
...for making my dream come true again.

870
01:18:30,321 --> 01:18:33,222
Sir, the credit goes to Rohit Mehra...

871
01:18:33,924 --> 01:18:36,791
If it wasn't for his notes and research...

872
01:18:37,328 --> 01:18:39,796
...it was impossible to build
that computer again.

873
01:18:41,165 --> 01:18:44,464
Absolute genius! - You're right, sir

874
01:18:45,336 --> 01:18:47,804
The computer that Rohit made in 2 years...

875
01:18:48,005 --> 01:18:50,132
...has taken us so many years to make.

876
01:18:52,609 --> 01:18:55,476
That's why I still miss him.

877
01:18:57,414 --> 01:18:58,312
Excuse me

878
01:19:17,034 --> 01:19:23,371
People say "Who has seen the future?"

879
01:19:25,476 --> 01:19:30,379
But in a few days, you and I...

880
01:19:31,215 --> 01:19:36,118
...will change this forever.

881
01:19:37,988 --> 01:19:40,616
Breaking news!

882
01:19:40,858 --> 01:19:44,123
After years of struggle, hard work,
research and patience...

883
01:19:44,294 --> 01:19:50,324
...Dr. Siddhant Arya's most ambitious project
is about to be completed.

884
01:19:50,901 --> 01:19:54,837
According to our correspondent,
in just a few days...

885
01:19:55,039 --> 01:19:59,169
...Dr. Arya will be able to predict the future of
individuals, countries and the world!

886
01:19:59,376 --> 01:20:01,435
He'll also be able to change the
course of their destinies.

887
01:20:01,645 --> 01:20:05,081
And the truth is, one who can see
and change the future...

888
01:20:05,282 --> 01:20:07,648
...is considered like God!

889
01:20:10,087 --> 01:20:11,247
Wrong!

890
01:20:12,956 --> 01:20:15,754
Not Like God...

891
01:20:16,527 --> 01:20:19,496
He is God!

892
01:20:21,298 --> 01:20:25,132
I will be God.

893
01:20:26,136 --> 01:20:29,401
Now no one can stop me.

894
01:21:04,308 --> 01:21:07,072
We're already late and then
this is how you park the car?

895
01:21:07,311 --> 01:21:09,211
I can't even open the door!
How am I going to get out?

896
01:21:09,446 --> 01:21:11,380
But neither can I!

897
01:21:11,482 --> 01:21:16,647
Great! Let's just sit in the car
and stare at each other!

898
01:21:16,854 --> 01:21:19,618
You always mess things up!
Krishna's flight must have landed...

899
01:21:19,823 --> 01:21:21,916
...he must be looking for us.

900
01:21:48,452 --> 01:21:49,919
I'm sorry, Sir!

901
01:21:50,120 --> 01:21:51,781
You're not hurt, are you?

902
01:22:12,910 --> 01:22:13,604
Krishna

903
01:22:21,418 --> 01:22:25,218
Krishna, you're looking
is so good in these clothes.

904
01:22:27,457 --> 01:22:28,583
They are my fathers.

905
01:22:29,927 --> 01:22:33,488
Krishna, welcome to Singapore!

906
01:22:33,897 --> 01:22:37,060
O my god! You look so handsome!

907
01:22:38,101 --> 01:22:39,830
You two have come alone?

908
01:22:40,037 --> 01:22:42,301
How can two people be 'alone'?

909
01:22:42,506 --> 01:22:46,738
No! I mean, hasn't your mother
come with you?

910
01:22:46,944 --> 01:22:47,740
Mother?

911
01:22:48,111 --> 01:22:49,408
Is she also coming here?

912
01:22:49,780 --> 01:22:50,906
It would've been nice if she were here.

913
01:22:51,281 --> 01:22:55,513
I'd have asked for your hand and
gone back to India immediately.

914
01:22:56,220 --> 01:22:57,482
Grandma's all alone, you see.

915
01:22:58,655 --> 01:23:00,088
He's in a tearing hurry!

916
01:23:00,290 --> 01:23:02,554
Has he brought a priest along to
solemnize the wedding?

917
01:23:02,759 --> 01:23:03,350
Shut up!

918
01:23:04,394 --> 01:23:04,860
What happened?

919
01:23:05,062 --> 01:23:08,793
Well actually, Mom, you know...

920
01:23:08,999 --> 01:23:10,694
Her mom's gone.

921
01:23:10,901 --> 01:23:11,925
Yeah she's gone...

922
01:23:12,402 --> 01:23:13,027
Gone?

923
01:23:13,737 --> 01:23:15,227
To Hong Kong

924
01:23:15,439 --> 01:23:16,201
Yes, Hong Kong!

925
01:23:16,406 --> 01:23:17,100
Hong Kong?

926
01:23:17,841 --> 01:23:19,866
She'll be back in 10-15 days

927
01:23:20,077 --> 01:23:21,203
Yes, she'll come.

928
01:23:21,411 --> 01:23:25,575
10-15 days? But what will I do here
for so many days?

929
01:23:25,816 --> 01:23:29,877
Why Krishna? Didn't you take us around
your village when we came there?

930
01:23:30,087 --> 01:23:31,918
Now we'll show you our city.

931
01:23:35,525 --> 01:23:36,753
This is your apartment.

932
01:23:37,194 --> 01:23:38,957
This is your living room.

933
01:23:39,263 --> 01:23:41,128
This is your bedroom

934
01:23:41,431 --> 01:23:43,456
And these clothes are for you

935
01:23:43,667 --> 01:23:45,191
This is your cell phone.

936
01:23:45,702 --> 01:23:47,294
It has all our numbers.

937
01:23:47,671 --> 01:23:49,696
You can call us anytime.

938
01:23:52,175 --> 01:23:55,633
But why can't I live with you
in your house, Priya?

939
01:23:57,047 --> 01:23:57,877
Well...

940
01:23:58,248 --> 01:24:00,648
Because mom...
...is not around

941
01:24:00,851 --> 01:24:03,115
Yes! Mom's not around
wouldn't be proper

942
01:24:07,291 --> 01:24:08,315
Hey! My phone is ringing!

943
01:24:08,992 --> 01:24:10,823
It says 'Mama' how do I take the call?

944
01:24:11,261 --> 01:24:14,321
Looks like I gave you my cell phone
by mistake, Excuse me.

945
01:24:14,564 --> 01:24:16,794
Hello Priya, I have good news!

946
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:18,633
I've found a boy for you.

947
01:24:18,835 --> 01:24:21,269
I'm busy right now.
I'll call you later, Mama.

948
01:24:21,471 --> 01:24:22,995
It was your mom's call?
Let me say hello to her.

949
01:24:23,206 --> 01:24:24,764
No, it wasn't mom

950
01:24:24,975 --> 01:24:27,466
It was my uncle.

951
01:24:28,312 --> 01:24:29,540
I could've said hello to him.

952
01:24:29,746 --> 01:24:31,111
Does he live here too?

953
01:24:31,315 --> 01:24:32,009
Yes...

954
01:24:32,749 --> 01:24:35,149
No! He lives in India.

955
01:24:35,352 --> 01:24:37,047
I see, where in India?

956
01:24:37,487 --> 01:24:39,785
Krishna, we've got to go to office.

957
01:24:39,990 --> 01:24:42,652
We'll give you her uncle's address later.

958
01:24:42,859 --> 01:24:45,589
with pin code. But we've got to leave now. Bye!

959
01:24:46,697 --> 01:24:48,790
Bye! - Bye

960
01:24:50,367 --> 01:24:52,858
How many lies do we have
to speak to cover up one lie?

961
01:24:53,070 --> 01:24:55,470
The excuse of an uncle saved us today!
- Tomorrow it'll be an aunt!

962
01:24:55,672 --> 01:24:57,970
There is no dearth of relatives. Relax!

963
01:24:58,775 --> 01:25:00,333
Did you see his eyes?

964
01:25:01,011 --> 01:25:03,002
They were full of love and trust.

965
01:25:03,747 --> 01:25:05,180
Honey, I can't do this!

966
01:25:05,382 --> 01:25:07,145
I can't hurt Krishna anymore.

967
01:25:07,351 --> 01:25:10,752
Hurt? He's going to become a
celebrity thanks to you.

968
01:25:10,954 --> 01:25:12,649
And we'll get a promotion.

969
01:25:12,856 --> 01:25:16,690
And even if he gets to know,
a small lie is not going to hurt him

970
01:25:18,995 --> 01:25:19,825
What happened?

971
01:25:20,364 --> 01:25:24,892
You? How did you get here from the 20th floor?

972
01:25:25,135 --> 01:25:25,726
I took the stairs.

973
01:25:25,936 --> 01:25:27,335
Stairs?

974
01:25:27,537 --> 01:25:33,908
Actually, Priya, I've got something for you...

975
01:25:36,513 --> 01:25:37,104
What?

976
01:25:41,151 --> 01:25:43,483
I'll go get the car ok?

977
01:25:48,325 --> 01:25:49,451
Close your eyes.

978
01:25:51,461 --> 01:25:55,227
Priya, why do you widen your eyes
whenever I ask you to close them?

979
01:26:00,203 --> 01:26:01,067
Open them now

980
01:26:05,175 --> 01:26:07,473
May I put it on your finger?

981
01:26:13,250 --> 01:26:13,909
Give me your hand

982
01:26:24,428 --> 01:26:26,794
Looks nice?

983
01:26:28,432 --> 01:26:29,399
Yes, now it looks nice.

984
01:26:30,934 --> 01:26:32,834
Okay bye. - Bye

985
01:26:35,505 --> 01:26:36,631
What happened?

986
01:26:36,873 --> 01:26:39,273
I'll tell you later, lets go!

987
01:27:37,367 --> 01:27:39,301
No money- Okay

988
01:27:53,583 --> 01:27:54,345
Brother!

989
01:29:16,466 --> 01:29:17,524
Thank you.

990
01:29:19,035 --> 01:29:20,024
You're welcome

991
01:29:23,873 --> 01:29:25,898
Kristian Xuan Zhong Min Lee

992
01:29:26,509 --> 01:29:27,134
What?

993
01:29:27,744 --> 01:29:29,041
My name... too long

994
01:29:29,446 --> 01:29:32,142
Short? Kris Lee, okay?

995
01:29:32,482 --> 01:29:33,779
Oh, okay! Kris Lee.

996
01:29:33,984 --> 01:29:34,882
Nice name.

997
01:29:35,619 --> 01:29:38,110
My name is Krishna... Krishna Mehra.

998
01:29:38,321 --> 01:29:40,152
Krishna? India?

999
01:29:40,390 --> 01:29:41,880
Yes, India

1000
01:29:43,693 --> 01:29:46,821
I work here in the Great Bombay Circus

1001
01:29:49,366 --> 01:29:50,799
Must come, okay?

1002
01:29:52,402 --> 01:29:52,993
Okay.

1003
01:29:53,203 --> 01:29:54,329
Sunday, Okay?

1004
01:29:55,205 --> 01:29:56,331
Sunday, okay.

1005
01:29:59,009 --> 01:30:01,170
Ten days will go by in no time.

1006
01:30:01,711 --> 01:30:04,271
Tell me how are you finding it there?

1007
01:30:04,481 --> 01:30:05,413
Its very nice, Grandma.

1008
01:30:05,615 --> 01:30:07,048
There are a lot of high rise buildings here.

1009
01:30:07,250 --> 01:30:09,741
And my apartment is on the 20th floor...

1010
01:30:09,953 --> 01:30:12,478
And I'm talking to you from the balcony right now.

1011
01:30:13,490 --> 01:30:15,458
Ok, ok, take care of yourself.

1012
01:30:15,659 --> 01:30:19,026
And give my love and blessings to Priya.

1013
01:30:19,396 --> 01:30:22,490
Just imagine! That's the
name of our new show.

1014
01:30:22,699 --> 01:30:29,002
Can you imagine a human being
climbing a tree faster than a monkey?

1015
01:30:29,205 --> 01:30:33,266
No... isn't it? Well after watching
our show today.

1016
01:30:33,476 --> 01:30:36,968
You won't just imagine,
but also believe that is possible.

1017
01:30:37,180 --> 01:30:41,446
Get set then! On one end is the
world famous orangutan Mao...

1018
01:30:42,018 --> 01:30:44,953
...who in a blink, will climb this pole.

1019
01:30:45,155 --> 01:30:47,817
And on the other side is
Indian superboy Krishna!

1020
01:30:49,225 --> 01:30:49,884
What's happening here, Priya?

1021
01:30:50,093 --> 01:30:50,752
What happened?

1022
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:52,894
You brought me here to watch a shoot!

1023
01:30:53,096 --> 01:30:57,032
True. But then I thought if you can watch a shoot,
you can even perform in it!

1024
01:30:57,233 --> 01:30:59,565
But how can I climb the pole faster than Mao?

1025
01:30:59,769 --> 01:31:02,966
Like you climbed the mountain!
The zigzag manner... remember?

1026
01:31:03,173 --> 01:31:05,403
But what if I lose to Mao?

1027
01:31:05,608 --> 01:31:07,439
I'm sure you won't.

1028
01:31:07,644 --> 01:31:08,668
But what if I do?

1029
01:31:09,279 --> 01:31:09,836
well...

1030
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:12,011
I'll marry Mao then.

1031
01:31:14,684 --> 01:31:16,447
No! I'll never let that happen.

1032
01:31:17,087 --> 01:31:18,918
So do it please! It'll be great fun.

1033
01:31:25,428 --> 01:31:26,395
Fun it will be.

1034
01:31:27,397 --> 01:31:29,092
Sir we're ready

1035
01:31:29,299 --> 01:31:29,924
Ready is it?

1036
01:31:30,133 --> 01:31:31,600
Chao, is Mao ready?

1037
01:31:31,801 --> 01:31:32,699
Ready

1038
01:31:34,070 --> 01:31:35,435
Krishna... Ready?

1039
01:31:37,540 --> 01:31:41,271
Priya, there's just a pole's distance
between us and our success!

1040
01:31:41,478 --> 01:31:43,309
Not a pole, it's just a moment. Stupid!

1041
01:31:43,513 --> 01:31:44,571
Taking

1042
01:31:56,826 --> 01:31:57,758
Roll camera

1043
01:31:59,362 --> 01:32:00,090
Action

1044
01:32:07,270 --> 01:32:08,032
Cut!

1045
01:32:11,941 --> 01:32:14,239
What the hell is this?

1046
01:32:14,577 --> 01:32:16,636
Boss, it's all about brotherhood

1047
01:32:16,846 --> 01:32:18,006
Shut up!

1048
01:32:18,181 --> 01:32:19,239
Sorry, Sir

1049
01:32:20,016 --> 01:32:21,483
Come on Mao, come on

1050
01:32:21,718 --> 01:32:23,811
Roll camera... Action

1051
01:32:27,624 --> 01:32:28,283
Cut!

1052
01:32:30,994 --> 01:32:34,657
You stupid ape! I've paid a lot
of money for you, okay?

1053
01:32:34,864 --> 01:32:36,832
And I'm tired of you monkeying around

1054
01:32:37,033 --> 01:32:40,332
You don't get your act together;
you're out of my show. Okay?

1055
01:32:44,374 --> 01:32:46,342
I've straightened a lot of these smart alecs

1056
01:32:56,853 --> 01:32:57,877
Roll camera!

1057
01:32:58,955 --> 01:32:59,649
Action.

1058
01:33:08,498 --> 01:33:09,760
Where is the fish?

1059
01:33:10,266 --> 01:33:10,857
Cut!

1060
01:33:20,844 --> 01:33:21,833
Roll camera!

1061
01:33:23,046 --> 01:33:23,876
Action.
