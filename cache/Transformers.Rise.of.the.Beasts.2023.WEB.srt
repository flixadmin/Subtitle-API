00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:26,816
So, it's been real, y'all.
But...

632
00:32:26,816 --> 00:32:28,728
- Uh, time-out.
- Mirage.

633
00:32:28,902 --> 00:32:32,108
I know. I know. Just relax.
Let me just talk to my guy real quick.

634
00:32:32,108 --> 00:32:34,201
[whispers] Yo, don't leave me
with these tight-asses, bro.

635
00:32:34,201 --> 00:32:35,550
We make a great team.

636
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:37,582
This is a waste of time.

637
00:32:37,582 --> 00:32:40,143
Look, I'm not breaking into a museum
for some space robots.

638
00:32:40,143 --> 00:32:42,002
But what about for friendship?

639
00:32:43,134 --> 00:32:45,397
Uh, uh... Or, or, or

640
00:32:45,397 --> 00:32:47,304
what about for cash?

641
00:32:48,008 --> 00:32:51,794
Uh-huh. You help us get this key,
so we can get off this rock--

642
00:32:51,969 --> 00:32:54,101
No offense.
Love the neighborhood and all.

643
00:32:54,101 --> 00:32:56,495
And then I let you sell me.

644
00:32:56,669 --> 00:32:58,714
[mechanical whirring]
Lambo?

645

Indy?

647
00:33:03,751 --> 00:33:06,679
Look, you get paid
and then I'll split.

648
00:33:07,133 --> 00:33:08,908
So all I gotta do
is walk in and out?

649
00:33:08,908 --> 00:33:11,445
[Mirage] All you gotta do.
We'll take care of the rest.

650
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:14,034
Cross my spark
and hope to die.

651
00:33:14,208 --> 00:33:16,621
Wow! That was corny
when I said it out loud.

652
00:33:18,473 --> 00:33:21,433
[Noah] What about the big man?
Optimal, or whatever.

653
00:33:21,433 --> 00:33:23,652
You let me worry about him.

654
00:33:23,826 --> 00:33:24,871
Cool?

655
00:33:26,873 --> 00:33:29,615
Ah! Got him!
He's in, baby! Whoo!

even though
you're from way out in space.

660
00:34:00,733 --> 00:34:03,301
But now there's this key
that opens a portal back to your home?

661
00:34:03,475 --> 00:34:06,434
Oh, and you know this
because there's a beacon light in the sky

662
00:34:06,434 --> 00:34:08,393
that I can't see
because I'm human.

- It's super weird.

664
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,976
You know what's weird?
Marky Mark is leaving the Funky Bunch!

665
00:34:13,976 --> 00:34:17,132
I heard he's just gonna pursue
acting now. That's crazy!

666
00:34:17,132 --> 00:34:19,317
- What? How does that...
- [Mirage] What a world.

667
00:34:19,491 --> 00:34:20,709
Whatever, man.

668
00:34:20,883 --> 00:34:22,641
I'm just trying
to collect this money

669
00:34:22,641 --> 00:34:25,569
and get your angry-ass boss off of Earth
before he blows a gasket.

00:34:25,569 --> 00:34:26,889
[Mirage]
Don't take it personal.

671
00:34:26,889 --> 00:34:28,761
He just misses home.

672
00:34:28,935 --> 00:34:31,815
And I think he blames himself
for us getting stuck here.

673
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:34,556
Earth was supposed
to be a pit stop, you know,

674
00:34:34,556 --> 00:34:38,379
a place for us to regroup
and rejoin the war back home.

Prime feels like it's his fault
we've been stranded here,

676
00:34:41,107 --> 00:34:43,210
like he has to fix it
all on his own.

All right, team, heads up.
There's security up ahead.

[Mirage] Nice!

00:34:47,492 --> 00:34:48,658
This is gonna be fun, man.

680
00:34:48,658 --> 00:34:50,628
No, no, no. No, bro.
You need to switch it up.

681
00:34:50,762 --> 00:34:54,351
You need to turn into a helicopter
or a speedboat or something.

[Prime]
I do not like this plan.

687
00:35:16,464 --> 00:35:19,310
[Arcee] Yeah, Mirage isn't
really known for being quiet.

688
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:21,422
At least Mirage is one of us.

689
00:35:21,596 --> 00:35:23,903
We should not be relying
on a human.

They are my friends.

The humans will always
protect what is theirs.

We can only trust

00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:55,372
[Wheeljack]
Okay, you guys, check this out.

1112
00:59:55,372 --> 00:59:58,376
The coordinates you gave me
correspond to an old church.

1113
00:59:58,376 --> 00:59:59,507
Take a look.

1114
00:59:59,682 --> 01:00:02,119
[whirring, chittering]

1115
01:00:02,293 --> 01:00:05,731
That's Santo Domingo. The Spanish built it
on top of an old Inca temple.

1116
01:00:05,905 --> 01:00:09,692
Correcto. I picked up some residual
energy readings around the courtyard,

1117
01:00:09,866 --> 01:00:12,303
so I'm guessing
the key's somewhere close by.

1118
01:00:12,477 --> 01:00:15,006
But we may have some trouble
getting there.

1119
01:00:15,006 --> 01:00:16,176
Inti Raymi.

1120
01:00:16,176 --> 01:00:19,022
It's a festival that
shuts down the whole city.

1121
01:00:19,022 --> 01:00:21,399
- Guess it's a night mission then.
- [Prime] No.

1122
01:00:21,573 --> 01:00:23,889
Scourge could already be here.

1123
01:00:23,889 --> 01:00:27,100
We must retrieve
the other half before he does.

1124
01:00:29,363 --> 01:00:31,140
- Me and Elena will do it.
- Hmm?

1125
01:00:31,564 --> 01:00:33,550
Y'all would never
make it two blocks.

1126
01:00:33,550 --> 01:00:36,641
There's human security all around
the church. You'll never get through.

1127
01:00:36,641 --> 01:00:38,487
Then we'll have to take
a play out of your book.

1128
01:00:39,591 --> 01:00:40,720
We'll hide in plain sight.

1129
01:00:41,854 --> 01:00:43,287
We'll blend in
with the parade.

1130
01:00:44,161 --> 01:00:46,436
It is not a bad idea.

1131
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:49,949
We will keep an eye out
for the Terrorcons.

1132
01:00:49,949 --> 01:00:53,618
On first sign of trouble,
we are going in.

1133
01:00:53,618 --> 01:00:55,215
Yo, Noah, think fast.

1134
01:00:55,389 --> 01:00:57,391
[mechanical whirring]

1135
01:01:01,439 --> 01:01:03,659
And if you need help,
just holler.

1136
01:01:05,356 --> 01:01:08,141
[crowd cheering]

1137
01:01:08,315 --> 01:01:10,448
[up-tempo music playing]

1138
01:01:19,196 --> 01:01:21,633
[Prime hisses]
I am in position.

1139
01:01:21,807 --> 01:01:23,591
[Mirage]
All right, coast is clear.

1140
01:01:23,766 --> 01:01:26,333
Noah, Elena, it's go time.

1141
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:29,336
Blend in. Act natural.

1142
01:01:30,729 --> 01:01:32,383
[crowd applauding]

1143
01:01:36,779 --> 01:01:38,432

[chittering]

1145
01:02:02,195 --> 01:02:04,937
[Nightbird] Autobots must be using
their new pets

1146
01:02:04,937 --> 01:02:07,070
to reach the temple.

1147
01:02:07,244 --> 01:02:09,376
Lovely.

1148
01:02:09,550 --> 01:02:12,118
They're doing our work
for us.

1149
01:02:12,292 --> 01:02:14,668
Go fetch.

1150
01:02:19,256 --> 01:02:21,258
[Noah] The key's gotta be
in here somewhere.

1151
01:02:22,041 --> 01:02:23,042
Yeah.

1152
01:02:24,348 --> 01:02:26,829
[distant cheering, drumming]

1153
01:02:36,969 --> 01:02:39,187
That stonework is 17th century.

1154
01:02:39,711 --> 01:02:42,758
What we're looking for
is something

1155
01:02:43,584 --> 01:02:46,413
much, much older.

1156
01:02:54,637 --> 01:02:57,754
- What is it?
- It's the same insignia on Airazor.

1157
01:02:58,235 --> 01:03:00,079
But it's not lined up right.

1158
01:03:00,253 --> 01:03:02,734
[cheering]

1159
01:03:02,908 --> 01:03:04,518
Wait, you see that?

1160
01:03:04,692 --> 01:03:09,523
I think there's something
under here. [grunts]

1161
01:03:09,697 --> 01:03:12,222
[rumbling]

1162
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:14,877
There's another one.

1163
01:03:19,316 --> 01:03:20,752
There is.

1164
01:03:25,191 --> 01:03:27,324
[rumbling]

1165
01:03:29,892 --> 01:03:30,936
Now what?

1166
01:03:32,276 --> 01:03:34,679
[Elena] I thought it would've--
[shouts]

1167
01:03:48,171 --> 01:03:50,434
That's some
Indiana Jones-type shit.

1168
01:03:51,914 --> 01:03:53,567
You sure about this?

1169
01:03:54,264 --> 01:03:55,265
No.

1170
01:04:04,143 --> 01:04:06,232
[Prime buzzes]
Any sign of Scourge?

1171
01:04:06,232 --> 01:04:07,538
Nope, all clear here.

1172
01:04:07,712 --> 01:04:08,979
[Mirage] Uh, yeah.

1173
01:04:08,979 --> 01:04:10,889
- It's just groupies over here.
- [camera shutter clicks]

1174
01:04:11,063 --> 01:04:13,283
[Prime] Stay on task, Mirage.

1175
01:04:13,457 --> 01:04:16,286
Prime, you gotta learn
how to relax, my man.

1176
01:04:17,896 --> 01:04:19,550
[chittering]

1177
01:04:20,899 --> 01:04:23,728
[both breathing heavily]

1178
01:04:23,728 --> 01:04:24,903
Ah.

1179
01:04:38,961 --> 01:04:42,921
You know, we must be the first
people to walk here in half a millennium.

1180
01:04:44,792 --> 01:04:47,259
- [glove buzzes]
- [Mirage] Yo, Sonic. You dead yet?

1181
01:04:47,259 --> 01:04:48,709
[glove buzzing]

1182
01:04:49,164 --> 01:04:50,215
No.

1183
01:04:50,973 --> 01:04:52,438
Wait, did you just
call me Sonic?

1184
01:04:53,062 --> 01:04:54,454
I think that's a temple.

1185
01:05:01,157 --> 01:05:03,115
What are we looking for?

1186
01:05:03,289 --> 01:05:05,161
[Elena]
You see the symbols on that temple?

1187
01:05:05,335 --> 01:05:07,032
They match the ones
in the courtyard.

1188
01:05:07,206 --> 01:05:08,642
I think it's up there.

1189
01:05:20,437 --> 01:05:22,613
I think we found
what we came here for.

1190
01:05:22,787 --> 01:05:25,094
[quiet growling]

1191
01:05:25,268 --> 01:05:27,052
I always wondered
what it would feel like

1192
01:05:27,052 --> 01:05:29,161
to be there when artifacts
were actually found.

1193
01:05:32,710 --> 01:05:35,234
All right. Now come on, push.

1194
01:05:37,715 --> 01:05:39,586
[grunting]

1195
01:05:43,442 --> 01:05:45,114
Are you even pushing?

1196
01:05:45,288 --> 01:05:47,290
[grunts] Yeah, I'm pushing.

1197

[coughs]

1200
01:05:58,649 --> 01:06:00,694
- Wait, what?
- Just-- Just let me think.

1201
01:06:00,868 --> 01:06:02,740
Oh, no, no. Where is it?

1202
01:06:02,834 --> 01:06:07,005
Sometimes there's, like, a--
like a false bottom or something.

1203
01:06:10,530 --> 01:06:11,879
[blows] Look.

1204
01:06:12,054 --> 01:06:14,795
I think I found something.
You see these symbols?

1205
01:06:14,970 --> 01:06:18,103
I've seen markings like this--
the Airazor statue at my museum.

1206
01:06:18,277 --> 01:06:19,536
They're new.

1207
01:06:20,410 --> 01:06:22,049
They're not
on the Transwarp Key.

1208
01:06:22,803 --> 01:06:24,010
There's two of them.

1209

[rubble thudding]

[whispering] Mirage?

1211
01:06:38,863 --> 01:06:41,561
- Let's keep moving.
- Just give me a second.

1212
01:06:45,870 --> 01:06:47,219
- Run!

Mirage! We got trouble!

1218
01:06:59,079 --> 01:07:01,625
One of those things is down here!
Where are you guys?

1219
01:07:01,625 --> 01:07:03,297
[Mirage] Hang tight!
I'm on the way.

The Autobots are moving.

1222
01:07:08,305 --> 01:07:10,242
They must have found the key.

Airazor, where are the humans?

1228

They're underground,

are you doing?

I'm going to take back
Scourge's key

I will end you, Scourge.

1271
01:10:34,403 --> 01:10:35,926
[growls]

1272
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:39,325
That is a promise.

1273
01:10:39,619 --> 01:10:41,236
[Nightbird]
They're getting away.

1274
01:10:41,410 --> 01:10:43,194
Not this time.

1275
01:10:45,327 --> 01:10:46,545
[Airazor screeches]

1276
01:10:50,288 --> 01:10:52,377
- [water burbling]
- I hear water.

1277
01:10:56,425 --> 01:10:57,567
Where are we?

1278
01:10:59,689 --> 01:11:02,126
[roaring, grunting]

1279
01:11:03,914 --> 01:11:05,042
What was that?

1280
01:11:05,216 --> 01:11:07,436
[roaring, grunting continues]

1281
01:11:15,574 --> 01:11:16,575
[Elena shouts]

1282
01:11:16,749 --> 01:11:19,143
[roars]

1283
01:11:19,317 --> 01:11:20,532
Who are you?

1284
01:11:21,406 --> 01:11:23,103
And why are you hunting
for the key?

1285
01:11:23,278 --> 01:11:25,714
Yo, Donkey Kong!
Stay away from my friends!

1286
01:11:25,714 --> 01:11:28,413
- Uh, Mirage?
- Don't worry. Your boy's got this.

1287
01:11:28,587 --> 01:11:31,024
- [roars]
- [Mirage squeals]

1288
01:11:31,024 --> 01:11:33,679
Stranger danger!
Stranger danger!

1289
01:11:34,226 --> 01:11:36,247
[Wheeljack] Hey, hey, hey!

1290
01:11:36,247 --> 01:11:37,379
Not so fa--

1291
01:11:38,336 --> 01:11:40,947
[roars]

1292
01:11:41,992 --> 01:11:42,993
Ay, ay, ay.

1293
01:11:43,167 --> 01:11:45,691
Hey! Over here,
kitty, kitty.

1294
01:11:46,866 --> 01:11:49,608
- Stand down!
- [mechanical whirring]

1295
01:11:49,782 --> 01:11:51,436
[roars]

1296
01:11:51,610 --> 01:11:54,657
I won't ask a second time.

1297
01:11:56,223 --> 01:11:57,312
[grunts]

1298
01:11:59,314 --> 01:12:01,446
No! All of you, stop!

1299
01:12:04,536 --> 01:12:06,625
- Airazor.
- Primal.

1300
01:12:06,799 --> 01:12:09,865
I thought you were lost.
All of you.

1301
01:12:09,865 --> 01:12:12,979
The others... Are they...

1302
01:12:13,153 --> 01:12:15,678
I am all that is left.

1303
01:12:17,027 --> 01:12:19,072
[exhales deeply]

1304
01:12:19,586 --> 01:12:22,987
Prime, these are
my fellow Maximals.

1305
01:12:22,987 --> 01:12:24,904
- Rhinox.
- [snorts]

1306
01:12:25,078 --> 01:12:26,471
[Airazor] Cheetor.

1307
01:12:26,645 --> 01:12:28,299
Sorry about scaring you, brother.

1308
01:12:28,473 --> 01:12:30,505
[Mirage] Scared?
[scoffs] Please.

1309
01:12:30,505 --> 01:12:31,868
- I'm not scared.
- [liquid drips]

1310
01:12:32,042 --> 01:12:33,748
That's just engine oil.
[chuckles]

1311
01:12:34,052 --> 01:12:38,048
[Airazor] And our leader,
Optimus Primal.

1312
01:12:38,782 --> 01:12:40,833
Optimus Primal?

1313
01:12:41,007 --> 01:12:45,142
Named after you,
the legendary warrior of Cybertron.

1314
01:12:45,316 --> 01:12:46,448
It's an honor.

1315
01:12:47,971 --> 01:12:50,974
Airazor,
I'm happy to see you, old friend.

1316
01:12:51,148 --> 01:12:54,151
But bringing others here
was not part of our plan.

1317
01:12:54,325 --> 01:12:56,675
I fear you bring dark tidings.

1318
01:12:56,675 --> 01:12:59,272
Scourge has come to Earth.

1319
01:12:59,436 --> 01:13:00,810
He's found us.

1320
01:13:00,984 --> 01:13:03,334
And he has half of the key.

1321
01:13:03,508 --> 01:13:06,119
We must find the second piece
before he does.

1322
01:13:06,293 --> 01:13:07,614
But it wasn't
in the cave.

1323
01:13:07,614 --> 01:13:11,257
It was.
But we moved it long ago to keep it safe.

1324
01:13:11,501 --> 01:13:13,475
Where is it now?

1325
01:13:16,869 --> 01:13:18,131
Come with me.

1326
01:13:26,488 --> 01:13:28,272
[Elena]
That doesn't look so good.

1327
01:13:28,446 --> 01:13:31,667
When Scourge touches you,
he leaves a mark.

1328
01:13:32,494 --> 01:13:33,906
But I'll be all right.

1329
01:13:35,410 --> 01:13:37,412
[screeches]

1330
01:13:47,822 --> 01:13:49,424
[Noah] Hey, back there
you called me Sonic.

1331
01:13:49,598 --> 01:13:51,770
Yeah. Your little bro's
got this thing

1332
01:13:51,770 --> 01:13:54,385
about using real names
over the airwaves, so...

1333
01:13:54,559 --> 01:13:56,569
- Wait, you been talking to Kris?
- Uh-huh.

1334
01:13:56,569 --> 01:13:59,608
- [machine beeping]
- He gave me this to keep tabs on you,

1335
01:13:59,608 --> 01:14:01,207
make sure I'm keeping
my promise.

1336
01:14:01,207 --> 01:14:02,698
Oh, here.

1337
01:14:02,872 --> 01:14:04,830
Next time,
include warning labels.

1338
01:14:05,004 --> 01:14:06,926
[Mirage]
Nah, go ahead, keep it.

1339
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:09,922
I guess it does
look better on me.

1340
01:14:10,096 --> 01:14:12,660
Just don't ask what part of my body
it came from.

1341
01:14:12,660 --> 01:14:13,665
[chuckles]

1342
01:14:15,450 --> 01:14:17,582
So, who are you?

1343
01:14:17,582 --> 01:14:20,105
[Primal] We Maximals
are an advanced race

1344
01:14:20,239 --> 01:14:23,936
dedicated to the expansion of life
throughout the universe.

1345
01:14:24,110 --> 01:14:27,807
We use the Transwarp Key
to visit young worlds.

1346
01:14:27,807 --> 01:14:31,030
The Nazca Lines,
the Temple at Tikal--

1347
01:14:31,204 --> 01:14:32,728
That was you guys, right?

1348
01:14:32,728 --> 01:14:33,980
[chuckles] Not us.

1349
01:14:34,134 --> 01:14:37,098
We cannot claim credit
for human ingenuity.

1350
01:14:37,222 --> 01:14:40,320
But you had the key.
Why stay on this world?

1351
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:42,738
When Unicron destroyed
our world,

1352
01:14:42,912 --> 01:14:46,524
we took an oath dedicated
to the preservation of life,

1353
01:14:46,698 --> 01:14:48,570
no matter the cost.

1354
01:14:48,744 --> 01:14:50,963
And Earth
has been a safe refuge.

1355
01:15:04,716 --> 01:15:06,631
[growling]

1356
01:15:06,805 --> 01:15:08,851
[laughing]

1357
01:15:19,862 --> 01:15:23,822
[speaking
Peruvian language]

1358
01:15:23,996 --> 01:15:25,563
[speaks
Peruvian language]

1359
01:15:28,131 --> 01:15:30,176
[speaks
Peruvian language]

1360
01:15:30,350 --> 01:15:32,007
[Primal] This is Amaru.

1361
01:15:32,701 --> 01:15:35,750
He and his family
are the last descendants of a tribe

1362
01:15:35,750 --> 01:15:39,303
that has watched over us
for hundreds of years.

1363
01:15:39,417 --> 01:15:43,581
When we arrived,
they shared their world with us.

1364
01:15:43,755 --> 01:15:46,018
And together
we protected its people

1365
01:15:46,192 --> 01:15:48,934
and our secret.

1366
01:15:55,593 --> 01:15:57,674
You allied with humans.

1367
01:15:58,378 --> 01:15:59,482
[Primal] We did.

1368
01:16:01,338 --> 01:16:03,732
[Prime]
If you give us this key,

1369
01:16:03,906 --> 01:16:08,220
tomorrow I will light the beacon
and bring Scourge to us.

1370
01:16:08,464 --> 01:16:12,392
The Maximals have already sacrificed one
home to protect the universe.

1371
01:16:12,567 --> 01:16:14,416
I won't risk losing another.

1372
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:17,812
As a leader,
I know you understand.

1373
01:16:20,226 --> 01:16:21,750
[electrical humming]

1374
01:16:42,771 --> 01:16:46,296
He is not the Optimus Prime
I imagined.

1375
01:16:46,470 --> 01:16:49,255
Well, he has lost so much.

1376
01:16:49,429 --> 01:16:51,301
Many more will perish

1377
01:16:51,475 --> 01:16:54,008
if the key falls
into the wrong hands.

1378
01:16:54,652 --> 01:16:58,264
If you had another chance
to save our home,

1379
01:16:58,438 --> 01:17:00,439
would you act any differently?

1380
01:17:01,354 --> 01:17:04,270
[growls quietly]

1381
01:17:04,444 --> 01:17:07,447
Optimus, come.
I want to show you something.

1382
01:17:07,622 --> 01:17:10,450
[growling]

1383
01:17:12,452 --> 01:17:14,629
[Primal] Your friend
will find peace here.

1384
01:17:16,413 --> 01:17:18,981
This is raw Energon.

1385
01:17:19,155 --> 01:17:21,026
[Primal]
The valley is rich with it.

1386
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:23,550
Could this revive Bee?

1387
01:17:23,550 --> 01:17:26,619
I'm sorry, but in this state,
it is inert.

1388
01:17:27,003 --> 01:17:29,347
It would take a great power
to ignite it.

1389
01:17:29,611 --> 01:17:31,773
Greater than anything
we have here.

1390
01:17:32,777 --> 01:17:35,171
[speaking Peruvian language]

1391
01:17:35,345 --> 01:17:38,261
I see that you are surprised
we entrust the key to them.

1392
01:17:38,435 --> 01:17:39,903
Yes, I am.

1393
01:17:40,437 --> 01:17:43,135
I've been amongst them
a long time now.

1394
01:17:43,309 --> 01:17:46,399
There is more to them
than meets the eye.

1395
01:17:46,573 --> 01:17:48,532
They are worth saving.

1396
01:17:59,133 --> 01:18:00,307
Hmm.

1397
01:18:18,605 --> 01:18:20,216
[animal squawking]

1398
01:18:23,436 --> 01:18:24,916
What if we didn't
destroy it?

1399
01:18:27,397 --> 01:18:32,532
Maybe there's another way
to-- to save both our homes.

1400
01:18:32,707 --> 01:18:35,710
Elena, I made a lot
of mistakes in my life.

1401
01:18:37,304 --> 01:18:38,547
This is different.

1402
01:18:41,585 --> 01:18:43,282
I can't fail at this.

1403
01:18:44,109 --> 01:18:45,668
I can't let my family down.

1404
01:18:46,372 --> 01:18:49,245
You're just like him.
You know that?

1405
01:18:49,419 --> 01:18:50,637
Who?

1406
01:18:50,812 --> 01:18:51,987
Optimus.

1407
01:18:53,510 --> 01:18:54,946
I'm serious.

1408
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:57,544
- He feels it too.
- Feels what?

1409
01:18:58,558 --> 01:19:00,050
Like a beast of burden

1410
01:19:00,735 --> 01:19:04,608
just trying to carry
the weight of the world on his shoulders.

1411
01:19:06,131 --> 01:19:09,519
You think he's some--
some general barking orders,

1412
01:19:09,519 --> 01:19:12,003
but when I look at him,

1413
01:19:12,003 --> 01:19:14,836
all I see is a big brother
trying to protect his family.

1414
01:19:35,944 --> 01:19:37,772

01:20:12,545 --> 01:20:13,808
[Elena] Are you okay?

1419
01:20:17,072 --> 01:20:19,770
[groaning]

1420
01:20:20,423 --> 01:20:21,424
Airazor?

1421
01:20:21,598 --> 01:20:25,210
I can feel Scourge!

1422
01:20:25,384 --> 01:20:27,778
He's...
[distorted] ...in my mind.

1423
01:20:27,952 --> 01:20:29,867

- [screams]
- [Prime] Run, Elena!

1427
01:20:42,662 --> 01:20:43,925
[Primal] No!

1428

[screeches]

1429

Noah, guard the key.

1433
01:20:58,087 --> 01:21:00,827
Take Elena
and find someplace safe to hide.

1434
01:21:02,944 --> 01:21:04,641
We must protect
the humans.

get out of here!

[gasps]

01:21:28,186 --> 01:21:29,840
We have to destroy it.

Noah!

1441
01:21:33,322 --> 01:21:34,845
[Prime] No!

1442
01:21:35,715 --> 01:21:37,013
Don't.

1443
01:21:40,277 --> 01:21:43,123
I know you want
to protect your people,

1444
01:21:43,767 --> 01:21:46,378
but if you destroy that key,

1445
01:21:46,552 --> 01:21:48,818
our home will be lost forever.

1446
01:21:49,512 --> 01:21:51,731
We do not have to choose.

Wait, wait.
Didn't I kill you already?

[roars] No!

I'm the Maximal that's going
to rip out your spark.

We'll see about that.

Remember our oath, Primal.

No matter the cost.

Are you okay?

1487

Scourge has the key.

I am sorry, Noah.

1497
01:26:40,672 --> 01:26:42,413
You were looking out
for your own.

1498
01:26:45,547 --> 01:26:47,195
I can't even be angry
at you for that.

1499
01:26:47,679 --> 01:26:52,331
On my home world, we believe that the
battle with darkness will continue

1500
01:26:52,331 --> 01:26:54,568
till all are one.

1501
01:26:55,774 --> 01:26:57,689
I lost sight of that.

1502
01:26:57,863 --> 01:27:01,780
You fought for yours
as I fought for mine

1503
01:27:01,954 --> 01:27:05,306
when we should have been fighting
the darkness together.

1504
01:27:09,092 --> 01:27:10,382
Well, I ain't done
fighting yet.

1505
01:27:16,186 --> 01:27:18,101
All right, everybody,
squad up!

1506
01:27:18,101 --> 01:27:19,308
Bring it in.

1507
01:27:19,972 --> 01:27:21,887
There's got to be a way
to stop this dude.

1508
01:27:22,061 --> 01:27:25,978
It's too late. The Transwarp has already
been activated.

1509
01:27:26,152 --> 01:27:28,410
It has more energy
than a supernova.

1510
01:27:28,654 --> 01:27:31,636
Any interruption
will ignite it like a bomb.

1511
01:27:31,810 --> 01:27:32,811
[explosion]

1512
01:27:32,811 --> 01:27:34,726
The only way
to stop this process

1513
01:27:34,726 --> 01:27:38,237
is an access code
installed long ago as a safeguard.

1514
01:27:38,237 --> 01:27:39,787
Okay, what's the code then?

1515
01:27:39,787 --> 01:27:42,299
The code was split
along with the key.

1516
01:27:42,473 --> 01:27:46,521
Sadly, the second half
of that code died with Airazor.

1517
01:27:46,695 --> 01:27:48,227
No, wait, wait, wait.
I got it.

1518
01:27:48,227 --> 01:27:49,785
The one hiding
her half of the key--

1519
01:27:49,959 --> 01:27:51,473
that had markings in it

1520
01:27:51,473 --> 01:27:54,050
just like the ones I found in the cave
where you hid yours.

1521
01:27:54,224 --> 01:27:57,053
Together, they must complete
the access code.

1522
01:27:57,053 --> 01:27:58,141
Hmm.

1523
01:27:58,315 --> 01:27:59,759
So we got a chance now, right?

1524
01:28:00,044 --> 01:28:01,666
A slim chance.

1525
01:28:01,666 --> 01:28:03,625
That is all we need

1526
01:28:03,799 --> 01:28:06,470
if you will show us the way, Primal.

1527
01:28:09,413 --> 01:28:12,261
All right.
We need to move quickly.

1528
01:28:12,261 --> 01:28:14,394
We have a small window
before the portal opens

1529
01:28:14,394 --> 01:28:16,072
large enough
for Unicron to enter.

1530
01:28:16,246 --> 01:28:19,380
The bridge is girded
by a series of tunnels.

1531
01:28:19,380 --> 01:28:21,900
They are too small
for Maximals, but...

1532
01:28:21,900 --> 01:28:23,601
But not for humans.

1533
01:28:23,775 --> 01:28:26,814
[Optimal] If Noah and Elena
reach the central antenna,

1534
01:28:27,518 --> 01:28:29,825
they can use the code
to shut it down,

1535
01:28:29,999 --> 01:28:32,523
- remove the Transwarp Key...
- [humming]

1536
01:28:32,697 --> 01:28:36,527
...and close the portal
before Unicron enters our atmosphere.

1537
01:28:36,701 --> 01:28:38,887
But Scourge
will be watching our every move.

1538
01:28:38,887 --> 01:28:41,227
He'll do anything to stop us
from getting the key.

1539
01:28:41,227 --> 01:28:43,404
Then we bring
the fight to him.

1540
01:28:43,578 --> 01:28:45,754
Autobots and Maximals

1541
01:28:45,754 --> 01:28:48,147
will charge the bridge together

1542
01:28:48,147 --> 01:28:51,082
and lure Scourge
onto the battlefield.

1543
01:28:51,082 --> 01:28:53,675
While me and Elena sneak in
through the back way.

1544

[rumbling]

1545
01:28:56,982 --> 01:28:59,202
It sounds like
we're all going to die.

1546
01:29:00,899 --> 01:29:05,426
If we are to die,
then we will die fighting

1547
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:07,428
all as one.

1548
01:29:07,602 --> 01:29:10,039
[rumbling]

1549
01:29:19,788 --> 01:29:23,574
This world is yours, master.

1550
01:29:24,401 --> 01:29:26,185
Scourge,

1551
01:29:26,360 --> 01:29:27,665
they're back.

1552
01:29:33,149 --> 01:29:36,761
[growls] Prime.

1553

[Noah] At least
the foot soldiers took the bait.

1565
01:30:47,353 --> 01:30:49,490
[Elena] Yeah, but Scourge didn't.
He's guarding the key.

1566
01:30:49,490 --> 01:30:53,838
All right. [groans] This should lead to
the bottom of the Transwarp control panel.

1567
01:30:53,838 --> 01:30:57,189
- Get the key, get the hell out of there.
- What are you gonna do?

1568
01:30:57,363 --> 01:30:59,432
I'm gonna go distract Scourge.

1569
01:30:59,432 --> 01:31:01,063
No, you can't take on
Scourge alone.

1570
01:31:01,237 --> 01:31:03,848
Relax.
I'm Mirage, remember?

1571
01:31:04,370 --> 01:31:05,676
[Noah] Hey.

We gotta hurry up.

[thudding]

[groans]

1581

Someone give me a real fight!

1582
01:32:01,123 --> 01:32:03,952
It's a fight you want?
You got one.

- [chuckles]

1586
01:32:21,796 --> 01:32:22,971
Nope!

1587
01:32:23,537 --> 01:32:24,538
Missed me!

1588
01:32:25,147 --> 01:32:26,307
[grunts]

1589

[groans] Noah, get to the key.
