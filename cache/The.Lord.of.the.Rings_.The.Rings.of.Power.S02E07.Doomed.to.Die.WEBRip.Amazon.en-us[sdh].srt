00:00:06,083 --> 00:00:08,458
{\an8}[Annatar] <i>The Greatest of Elven-smiths</i>
<i>is consumed by his work.</i>

2
00:00:08,541 --> 00:00:12,250
He asks that I handle all matters
of administration in his stead.

3
00:00:12,333 --> 00:00:13,958
I'm just fatigued.

4
00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:16,500
You are the Lord of Eregion.
You have responsibilities.

5
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:19,000
Until the Nine are complete,
nothing else matters.

6
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:22,000
[Annatar] Without <i>mithril,</i> the remaining
Rings of Power may never be complete.

7
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:23,458
We need more.

8
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:24,708
The answer is no.

9
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:27,250
Tell Narvi we're expanding the dig.

10
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:28,375
Have you gone mad?

11
00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:29,666
Take off the Ring.

12
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,916
I have nothing to prove to you, boy.

13
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:35,000
-[grunts]
-[Prince Durin IV groans]

14
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:39,125
We'll lay our bodies in front of that mine
ourselves if we have to.

15
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:40,041
[Narvi] Disa?

16
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,208
[Elrond] <i>The Orcs are not in Mordor.</i>

17
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:45,583
<i>A legion of them are headed for Eregion.</i>

18
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,333
<i>Galadriel was right.</i>

19
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:49,750
You must send aid!

20
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:54,791
Our armies cannot defeat both Adar
and Sauron. Not alone.

21
00:00:55,416 --> 00:00:56,875
[Orcs laughing]

22
00:00:56,958 --> 00:00:58,375
[Adar, in Sindarin] I brought you here.

23
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:00,291
For we share a common enemy.

24
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:04,708
[Galadriel, in English] <i>Elrond hastens</i>
<i>from Lindon with an army of Elves.</i>

25
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:07,333
And Nenya, my Ring.

26
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:10,083
[Adar] <i>Sauron believes he is still</i>
<i>beyond my grasp.</i>

27
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:12,458
But I know he hides in Eregion.

28
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,750
How fares your progress?

29
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:19,333
[Celebrimbor] <i>I cannot forge</i>
<i>more Rings without</i> mithril.

30
00:01:19,416 --> 00:01:20,750
[Annatar] <i>I have been to Khazad-dûm.</i>

31
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:22,375
One-ninth portion.

32
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:23,833
It should be enough.

33
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:28,041
[Galadriel] <i>Sauron has no army of his own,</i>

34
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:30,708
<i>so he's lured yours here instead.</i>

35
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:32,750
<i>He wants you to attack Eregion.</i>

36
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:34,333
[Adar] <i>Eregion will fall.</i>

37
00:01:34,416 --> 00:01:35,541
And Sauron with it.

38
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:36,541
Bind her.

39
00:01:36,625 --> 00:01:37,875
No!

40
00:01:37,958 --> 00:01:39,583
<i>This is what Sauron wants!</i>

41
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:43,375

[sighs]

45
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:57,583
Nine...

00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:00,208
[sighs]

47
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:01,708
...for mortal Men.

48
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:10,000
[sighs]

00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,541
[skittering, chittering]

50
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,666
[chittering]

51
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:37,833
Hello, Mr. Mouse.

52
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:39,208
[chuckles]

53
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:49,625
[gasps]

54
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:51,958
Have you fallen?

55
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:59,125
Come. The floor is hardly the place
for the Greatest of Elven-smiths.

56
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:00,416
No, I... I, uh...

57
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:02,250
[stammers]

58
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:07,708
Fëanor's hammer is, is missing a--

59
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,416
Missing a, a...

60
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:14,375
You know how forgetful you can be.

61
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:17,583
No, no.

62
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:21,625
No, this was different.

63
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:26,208
I trust you are not feeling
overwhelmed again?

64
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:28,541
No.

65
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:32,583
Quite the opposite, in fact.

66
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,416
These past weeks,
I have felt such clarity,

67
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,791
a focus that I have not known in years.

68
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:43,458
And I have you to thank for that.

69
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:45,208
Please.

70
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:47,458
When the world is still,

71
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:54,041
then the ideas can flow freely.

72
00:04:56,041 --> 00:05:01,666
My work is but to let them share
the secrets of their song.

73
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:08,375
How fares your progress?

74
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:11,166
[sighs]

75
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:15,541
The Rings of Power are nearly complete.

76
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:19,833
How long?

77
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:21,083
[scoffs]

78
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:23,541
What is another few days

79
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:29,166
to perfect something
that shall last forever?

80
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:30,458
[chuckles]

81
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,250
It will be a sad occasion.

82
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,041
I have so enjoyed our time together.

83
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,791
Well, all things must end.

84
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:50,791
A pity. Is it not?

85
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:01,791
[door opens]

86
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:04,791
[door closes]

87
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,666
[dramatic music playing]

88
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:29,666
[Orcs shouting]

89
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,625
[in Black Speech] It is time.

90
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,500
[Elves clamoring]

91
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:53,375
[in English] My lord.

92
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:55,208
What orders from Lord Celebrimbor?

93
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:57,625
Lord Celebrimbor refuses
to permit a counter-attack.

94
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:00,458
He says the river will protect us.

95
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:02,708
Every moment we remain idle,
more Elves die.

96
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:04,000
We must do something.

97
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:05,791
And that is why
we're not going to obey him.

98
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:07,041
[rumbling, explosions continue]

99
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:08,458
Gather your finest troops.

100
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:11,625
I am taking command of our defenses.

101
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:14,333
-Valar bless you, my lord.
-[soldier] This way. Go!

102
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:17,458
What is it? What are you not telling them?

103
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:21,708
Celebrimbor's mind is gone.

104
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,125
We are alone.

105
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:29,958
[soldier] Quickly.

106
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,000
Not alone.

107
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:41,333
You have proven your quality, Mirdania.

108
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:45,708
When the time comes,
I will see to it that you are...

109
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:47,208
[rumbling, explosions stop]

110
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:48,500
...duly rewarded.

111
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,458
What is it?

112
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:53,958
The siege engines. They've gone silent.

113
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,083
[woman] Get to safety!

114
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:03,500
[Orcs grunting]

115
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,791
[Zhor] Push it!

116
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:09,083
I said, push, you maggots.

117
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:10,916
[Orcs grunting]

118
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:14,708
Push, come on, you maggots!

119
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,041
Come on, you filth.

120
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:21,375
Put your stinkin' backs into it!

121
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,833
He's turning them away from the city.

122
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,916
Celebrimbor was more mistaken
than we knew.

123
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,458
Prepare for ground assault.

124
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,500
Ground assault? From across the river?

125
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:45,625
[grunts]

126
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,750
[distant explosions]

127
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:05,791
[Zhor] Again!

128
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:16,416
They're damming the river.

129
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,750
Prepare for ground assault!

130
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:47,416
[soldier] To your positions!

131
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:23,041
-[chittering]
-[gasps]

132
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,250
[Narvi] <i>Eregion is under siege.</i>

133
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:52,625
The guards received that entreaty
from an Elf at the West-gate.

134
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:57,916
Then they are more desperate
than we thought.

135
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:04,708
I need the mine taken back, now.

136
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:09,625
But, sire, your son is still down there.
And so is Princess--

137
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:12,125
Every hour that we delay

138
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:16,291
costs us unthinkable wealth.

139
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:21,541
We must dig.

140
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:27,875
Go!

141
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:34,958
Here they come.

142
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:40,416
Slow to learn, are you?

143
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,458
Easy, lads. Just turn around.

144
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,250
[Narvi] No.

145
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:58,166
We stand with you.

146
00:11:58,833 --> 00:11:59,916
Down your axes.

147
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,500
That Ring has taken the King's heart.
I will not let it take this mountain.

148
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:09,500
We have to get it off him.

149
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:12,291
Ours is not the only kingdom in peril.

150
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,666
There's an Elf outside, wants your ear.

151
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:20,083
Let him in.

152
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:23,833
Well, we'll have to do it quietly.

153
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:28,000
This particular Elf has been banished
from all Dwarven lands.

154
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:49,083
Elrond.

155
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:53,458
My heart sings to see you, old friend.

156
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:02,708
You tidal-haired,
flowery-tongued flagpole.

157
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:04,166
-"Tidal-haired"?
-Mm-hm!

158
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:10,958
You've got some sand comin' here.

159
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,875
Have you any idea what I've gone through
since you left?

160
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:19,041
It can hardly be more eventful
than what's transpired with me.

161
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,000
I'm about to overthrow my father.

162
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:40,250
What've you got?

163
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:47,083
Defeat.

164
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,500
Without your aid.

165
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,333
Thousands of lives are at hazard, Durin.

166
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,708
Celebrimbor is among them.

167
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:04,166
I know I ask too much of you, Durin,
but I need your axe, old friend.

168
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:07,833
I need it now.

169
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:16,291
[shouting, snarling]

170
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:21,916
[Orcs shouting]

171
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,500
Move it!

172
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:36,208
[shouting]

173
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:40,750
[arrows whooshing]

174
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,833
[in Sindarin] Loose arrows!

175
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,125
[groans]

176
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:07,291
[groans]

177
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:22,208
[grunting]

178
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:28,458
[shouting]

179
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:34,041
[in Sindarin] Hold fast!

180
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:36,125
[in English] Captain, they have a Ravager.

181
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:39,875
[Commander Malendol, in Sindarin]
Prepare to fire!

182
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,416
We must stop that machine!

183
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,291
[shouting]

184
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:47,958
[groans]

185
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,333
[grunting]

186
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,708
The Rings. Are they finished?

187
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,916
[shushing]

188
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:07,041
Wait for it.

189
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:09,958
Wait for what?

190
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:17,041
[chittering]

191
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:28,541
Captivating.

192
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,541
It is a pattern.

193
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,125
Do you not see? A cycle.

194
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:38,875
Repeating itself at intervals
throughout the day.

195
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:39,958
And there is more.

196
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,208
Here.

197
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,541
Look. The embers--

198
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,625
Celebrimbor, whatever so
inspired this epiphany,

199
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:49,458
I assure you, we have not the time for it.

200
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:50,708
On the contrary,

201
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:55,333
we would appear
to have all the time that we need.

202
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:05,375
The candles...
have not burned an inch all day.

203
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:09,375
You sought peace.

204
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:12,625
I gave it to you.

205
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:14,625
No.

206
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:19,875
Whatever... Whatever this is,
this is hardly a gift.

207
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:24,791
What have you done to me?

208
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:25,875
Done to you?

209
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:30,291
You welcomed my instruction.
You practically begged for it.

210
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:34,166
Now, a... a mouse scurries by,
and you fly to pieces.

211
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:37,458
Listen to yourself.

212
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:39,416
[shouts] Oh, what have you done to me?

213
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:44,791
No Emissary of the Valar would do this.

214
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:50,625
[softly] Who are you... truly?

215
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:53,791
I am the one keeping the storm at bay.

216
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:57,750
Balancing the very sun above your head.

217
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:02,250
All to give you this one chance
to prove your worth!

218
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:07,500
Now, I want the Nine!

219
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:08,750
No!

220
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:12,625
[shattering]

221
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:15,458

226
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:10,041
[sobbing]

227

[sobbing]

228
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:34,833
What...

229
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:39,416
[gasping]

230
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:44,125

[clatters]

232
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:47,333
What... The <i>mithril.</i>

233
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:49,000
[gasps]

234
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:53,583
What... What is... What is this?

235
00:19:55,333 --> 00:20:00,208
I have learned so much from you,
since I came to Eregion.

236
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:05,833
But no lesson more lasting than this.

237
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,583
True creation...

238
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:15,041
requires sacrifice.

239
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:23,375
You are He.

240
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:26,875
Are you not?

241
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:30,833
-You are--
-I have many names.

242
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:43,125

Mirdania!

247
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:25,625
[panting] Thank the Valar you're alive.

248
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:28,375
We have been deceived. All of us.

249
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:31,541
He planned all of this,
to force me to forge the Rings.

250
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:35,625
He put me in some kind of a prison.
A prison of the mind. But I am out.

251
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:37,791
I am out.

252
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:41,958
He must've been distracted by the siege,
so he forgot the ruby.

253
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:44,791
And the mouse. The same mouse--

254
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:46,166
And...

255
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:49,416
You must... You must believe me.

256
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:51,291
[gasping]

257
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:53,083
You have to believe me!

258
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:55,125
[Orcs grunting]

259
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:02,958
This is the thinnest part of the wall.

260
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:06,583
[Orc] Come on!

261
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:09,458
[grunting]

262
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:15,375
We have to brace the foundations!
Quickly, now!

263
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:23,541
Seize him.

264
00:22:25,666 --> 00:22:27,041
He is Sauron.

265
00:22:28,958 --> 00:22:30,125
Seize him!

266
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:34,916
He has been lying to you all along.

267
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:39,291
No. He has been protecting us.

268
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:42,166
While you've been in your tower,
giving orders that might have been

269
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,250
the end of us all.

270
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:45,791
No. No, that was him.

271
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:48,541
He is Sauron!

272
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:54,500
If you do not believe me, cut him open.

273
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,416
Look at his hand, look at his blood.

274
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:00,708
Black as pitch.

275
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:12,916
[gasping]

276
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,125
Come, my lord.

277
00:23:15,208 --> 00:23:17,125
Let's get you back where you belong.

278
00:23:17,208 --> 00:23:18,708
Get your hands off me!

279
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:21,291
-[screaming]
-No!

280
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,375
[gasping]

281
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:29,375

[shudders]

284
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,083
All this can end.

285
00:23:47,916 --> 00:23:52,125
Finish the Nine,
and I will spare your city.

286
00:23:57,125 --> 00:23:58,625
What will you do with them?

287
00:24:00,916 --> 00:24:04,083
Create a perfect and lasting peace.

288
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:12,083

289
00:24:12,166 --> 00:24:14,875

[shouting]

294
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:39,291
Come on!

295
00:24:43,416 --> 00:24:45,958
[Orcs shouting]

296
00:25:16,125 --> 00:25:17,958
[in Sindarin] Death to our foes!

297
00:25:18,333 --> 00:25:20,541
[all shouting]

298
00:25:24,958 --> 00:25:27,458
[all shouting]

299
00:25:39,541 --> 00:25:41,500
[all shouting]

[grunting]

301
00:26:29,458 --> 00:26:30,458
Halt!

302
00:26:40,375 --> 00:26:44,083
[in English] Welcome, Commander Elrond.

303
00:26:55,083 --> 00:26:56,458
The Ring you carry.

304
00:26:58,958 --> 00:26:59,958
Show it to me.

305
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:03,083
A foolish act if I had brought it here.

306
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:06,333
You are a courtier.

307
00:27:07,291 --> 00:27:09,750
More suited to wielding a scroll
than a sword.

308
00:27:09,833 --> 00:27:11,375
You've never seen me wield either.

309
00:27:11,458 --> 00:27:13,458
You should've just kept charging, Elrond.

310
00:27:13,541 --> 00:27:17,000
If she speaks again, cut out her tongue.

311
00:27:17,083 --> 00:27:18,875
[Orcs growl]

312
00:27:21,791 --> 00:27:25,541
Sauron is my enemy as much as yours.

313
00:27:26,583 --> 00:27:30,083
Give me what I need to defeat him
and let us all be rid of him.

314
00:27:30,166 --> 00:27:33,291
Is it not you that has done his bidding
by laying siege to Eregion?

315
00:27:33,375 --> 00:27:35,875
Eregion has fallen into shadow.

316
00:27:36,958 --> 00:27:42,083
It belongs to the Deceiver now,
as does every Elf within its walls.

317
00:27:42,166 --> 00:27:43,708
Not Lord Celebrimbor.

318
00:27:43,791 --> 00:27:47,958
It was Celebrimbor himself
who welcomed Sauron in.

319
00:27:49,208 --> 00:27:50,708
You cannot save him.

320
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:54,041
You can save Galadriel.

321
00:27:57,791 --> 00:27:59,375
It is an earnest offer.

322
00:28:00,916 --> 00:28:02,416
I suggest you take it.

323
00:28:03,541 --> 00:28:05,625
And leave Sauron to me.

324
00:28:12,541 --> 00:28:16,041
You have the beauty of your foremother,
Melian of the Valar.

325
00:28:17,541 --> 00:28:21,166
If even a fragment of her wisdom
is in your veins,

326
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:25,125
you must know you cannot
defeat me in battle.

327
00:28:26,666 --> 00:28:28,500
I will outmaneuver you,

328
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:34,250
my forces outfight yours,
and you will fall.

329
00:28:35,625 --> 00:28:38,791
Not before you have painted
the sands of the Glanduin black

330
00:28:39,625 --> 00:28:41,166
with the blood of your kin.

331
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:42,583
[growls]

332
00:28:42,666 --> 00:28:44,750
My children have endured cruelties

333
00:28:44,833 --> 00:28:48,208
your bravest couldn't bear
to hear spoken aloud.

334
00:28:49,375 --> 00:28:53,666
Are you prepared
to spend their lives so freely, Adar?

335
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,166
Are they?

336
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,958
The Ring for Galadriel's life.
What is it to be?

337
00:29:23,958 --> 00:29:25,791
Ask me on the field,

338
00:29:26,791 --> 00:29:29,208
when the neck
with a blade against it is yours.

339
00:29:29,291 --> 00:29:31,541
[Orcs seethe, snarl]

340
00:29:34,375 --> 00:29:35,375
Very well.

341
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:41,166
I will meet you there...

342
00:29:44,375 --> 00:29:46,458
with her head on a pike.

343
00:29:50,416 --> 00:29:53,625
If that is to be the way of things,
I should like to bid her farewell.

344
00:29:57,875 --> 00:29:59,083
He's unarmed.

345
00:30:17,625 --> 00:30:18,875
[whispers in Sindarin] Forgive me.

346
00:30:23,791 --> 00:30:24,958
Win.

347
00:30:59,375 --> 00:31:00,541
Vorohil.

348
00:31:01,541 --> 00:31:03,416
[Orcs snarling]

349
00:31:06,583 --> 00:31:10,250
[in English] The enemy outnumber us
ten to one. So why the confidence?

350
00:31:11,208 --> 00:31:13,833
[in Sindarin] Because I know something
the Father of the Orcs does not.

351
00:31:13,916 --> 00:31:14,958
[in English] And what is that?

352
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:18,458
[in Sindarin] Even now Prince Durin is
rallying a legion of Dwarves to our aid.

353
00:31:19,208 --> 00:31:21,250
And at the first rays of sunlight...

354
00:31:22,083 --> 00:31:25,750
...you will guide them
straight into Adar's flank.

355
00:31:27,166 --> 00:31:28,083
Outstanding.

356
00:31:32,916 --> 00:31:33,916
[in English] Ride to them now.

357
00:31:36,208 --> 00:31:38,333
Meantime, I will ensure
that Eregion's walls

358
00:31:38,416 --> 00:31:39,750
hold for one more night.

359
00:31:56,125 --> 00:31:58,916
Warriors of Khazad-dûm.

360
00:32:04,708 --> 00:32:06,375
At this moment,

361
00:32:07,583 --> 00:32:11,750
the great tale of our Age
is being written.

362
00:32:15,208 --> 00:32:20,583
<i>And it falls to us</i>
<i>to decide whether it will end</i>

363
00:32:20,666 --> 00:32:26,458
<i>in tragedy... or triumph.</i>

364
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:33,625
Sauron the Stoneheart,

365
00:32:35,916 --> 00:32:41,916
<i>who stole the seven smithing secrets</i>
<i>from our forebearers, has returned.</i>

366
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:48,916
<i>Forging Rings to enslave us</i>
<i>and all of Middle-earth.</i>

367
00:32:49,875 --> 00:32:52,333
The Elves cannot defeat him.

368
00:32:54,541 --> 00:32:55,958
Not without us.

369
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
<i>And Sauron knows this.</i>

370
00:33:07,625 --> 00:33:12,916
He thinks, by stoking our greed,

371
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:17,916
<i>he can turn our hearts to ash</i>

372
00:33:19,166 --> 00:33:23,166
<i>and sweep us from the field</i>
<i>without a fight.</i>

373
00:33:28,916 --> 00:33:32,375
But we are stronger than he knows.

374
00:33:32,458 --> 00:33:33,916
[all] Aye!

375
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,375
For there is something all Dwarves prize,

376
00:33:38,458 --> 00:33:41,250
far more than riches.

377
00:33:41,333 --> 00:33:45,083
More even than this mountain we hold dear.

378
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:51,708
Fight with me, so all the world can see,

379
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:54,416
that Dwarven loyalty

380
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:59,958
is a force stronger than any sorcery!

381
00:34:00,041 --> 00:34:01,041
[all] Aye!

382
00:34:01,125 --> 00:34:03,541
More powerful than any army!

383
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:04,875
[all] Aye!

384
00:34:04,958 --> 00:34:09,000
Deeper than the bones of the earth!

385
00:34:09,041 --> 00:34:10,541
[all] Aye!

386
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:14,375
Will you fight with our friends?

387
00:34:14,458 --> 00:34:15,625
[all] Aye!

388
00:34:15,708 --> 00:34:19,583
Will you fight for Khazad-dûm?

389
00:34:19,666 --> 00:34:22,958
[all] <i>Baruk Khazâd! Baruk Khazâd!</i>

[all] Dûm!

396
00:34:40,375 --> 00:34:43,416
We march for Eregion!

[all cheering]

398
00:34:52,583 --> 00:34:53,833

To the wall!

402
00:35:11,041 --> 00:35:11,958

[Zhor, in English]
Gonna spill your guts, Elf.

[gasps, coughing]

409
00:35:56,333 --> 00:35:57,333
[in Sindarin] Die.

410

[coughing, exclaims]

411
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:05,125
[in English] No! No! No, no! No!

417
00:36:42,291 --> 00:36:43,708
That's enough!

419
00:36:52,375 --> 00:36:53,583
[Orc laughs]

420
00:36:55,791 --> 00:36:58,791
[Orc captain] Again! Reset the Ravager!

421
00:37:00,291 --> 00:37:01,375
Move!

422
00:37:05,041 --> 00:37:06,250
[Glüg] Lord-father.

423
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:09,708
The wall is stronger than we thought.

424
00:37:09,791 --> 00:37:11,791
We may not breach it before morning.

425
00:37:12,541 --> 00:37:15,458
The Elf is faring better
than you expected.

426
00:37:15,541 --> 00:37:19,208
His troops have already destroyed five
of our trebuchets.

427
00:37:19,291 --> 00:37:21,000
Many <i>Uruk</i> are dying.

428
00:37:21,958 --> 00:37:23,833
What are your orders, Lord-father?

429
00:37:23,916 --> 00:37:26,166
-Shall we sound the retreat?
-No.

430
00:37:28,541 --> 00:37:30,125
Sauron must not escape.

431
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:35,750
Bring down that wall. At any cost.

432
00:37:35,833 --> 00:37:36,791
Adar!

433
00:37:41,166 --> 00:37:45,541
[in Black Speech]
You told us... you loved us.

434
00:37:46,625 --> 00:37:48,666
[in English]
With all that is left of my heart.

435
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,166
Too much,
to let you become Sauron's slaves.

436
00:38:10,708 --> 00:38:11,666
[in Black Speech] Hurry!

437
00:38:17,375 --> 00:38:20,500
[in English] She's still in the camp.
Find her!

438

[grunts]

441
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:55,375
[Orc] He's dead.

442
00:38:56,291 --> 00:38:57,291
He's gone.

443
00:38:58,375 --> 00:39:01,791
Eh. You there! Come here and help.

444
00:39:06,916 --> 00:39:07,916
He's dead.

445
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,291

[growling]

447
00:39:59,083 --> 00:40:01,375
[in Black Speech]
In flames they return to darkness.

448
00:40:04,333 --> 00:40:06,541
In flames they return to darkness.

449
00:40:20,833 --> 00:40:23,541
[growling]

450
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:36,916
[in English] Look at that pretty hair.

451
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,416
-[arrows whoosh]
-[groans]

452
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:01,541
[Galadriel sighs]

453
00:41:02,416 --> 00:41:04,875
Whatever force it was
that brought you here, soldier,

454
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:07,208
I am grateful for it.

455
00:41:07,625 --> 00:41:12,041
Come, I know a hidden way into the city.
We must find Sauron.

456
00:41:12,125 --> 00:41:13,541
I'm here for him.

457
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:22,750
Try to move against him now,
the cost will be your life.

458
00:41:25,125 --> 00:41:26,375
He can have it.

459
00:41:28,958 --> 00:41:31,250
He has taken everything else from me.

460
00:41:34,166 --> 00:41:35,375
Arondir.

461
00:41:38,041 --> 00:41:41,250
There is a dearth of Elven heroes
this night.

462
00:41:43,166 --> 00:41:46,875
It would be a pity to lose another.

463
00:41:48,875 --> 00:41:51,666
And the true fight with Adar
will come later.

464
00:42:04,625 --> 00:42:05,791
[Prince Durin IV sighs]

465
00:42:07,583 --> 00:42:09,916
The army has assembled at the West-gate,
Prince Durin.

466
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,208
Good.

467
00:42:11,291 --> 00:42:13,250
[Narvi shouts] Durin!

468
00:42:15,541 --> 00:42:16,541
Prince Durin!

469
00:42:18,875 --> 00:42:19,916
Wait!

470
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:28,625
Your father, he turned his axe on my men.

471
00:42:30,833 --> 00:42:33,666
He cut through them like stalks of wheat.

472
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:35,333
[chuckling]

473
00:42:35,708 --> 00:42:37,541
But he's gonna dig.

474
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:40,250
He's gonna loose that beast!

475
00:42:40,333 --> 00:42:42,625
-Disa, is she--
-I don't know.

476
00:42:42,708 --> 00:42:44,833
But she sent me to find you.

477
00:42:44,916 --> 00:42:47,625
She says you have to recall the army.

478
00:42:48,125 --> 00:42:49,583
And what about Elrond?

479
00:42:50,708 --> 00:42:53,000
You take that army to Eregion now,

480
00:42:53,791 --> 00:42:56,291
and Khazad-dûm
might not be here when you return.

481
00:43:12,416 --> 00:43:16,500
Be not afraid. This too shall pass.

482
00:43:19,291 --> 00:43:23,250
I promise you,
when Middle-earth is healed,

483
00:43:23,333 --> 00:43:25,875
and its people see
what you and I did here...

484
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:31,291
all our sufferings will be worth it.

485
00:43:32,833 --> 00:43:33,833
"Our sufferings"?

486
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:38,375
You must know it pains me,
treating you like--

487
00:43:38,458 --> 00:43:40,541
Like you've treated countless others?

488
00:43:45,125 --> 00:43:46,541
Like Morgoth treated me.

489
00:43:49,458 --> 00:43:52,458
Do you know what it is to be tortured
at the hands of a god?

490
00:43:54,833 --> 00:43:56,250
I cannot imagine.

491
00:43:57,916 --> 00:44:01,083
I see the end, Celebrimbor.

492
00:44:02,666 --> 00:44:03,791
So clearly.

493
00:44:05,041 --> 00:44:07,208
I have seen it from the moment I awoke.

494
00:44:08,666 --> 00:44:12,666
But his end, it was different from mine.

495
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:21,208
For what he wished to destroy,
I wished... to perfect.

496
00:44:24,458 --> 00:44:28,833
Sometimes, the pain
almost became a reward.

497
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:31,083
Became a game.

498
00:44:32,583 --> 00:44:36,416
A contest,
to see whose will was the mightier.

499
00:44:38,541 --> 00:44:42,958
And after all that, you would still choose
to inflict the same pain upon me?

500
00:44:43,041 --> 00:44:44,041
No.

501
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:52,833
You chose it.

502
00:44:55,083 --> 00:44:56,208
Not I.

503
00:44:58,500 --> 00:44:59,333
What?

504
00:45:03,041 --> 00:45:07,583
All depends... on the Rings.

505
00:45:08,958 --> 00:45:11,875
And since you forced me

506
00:45:11,958 --> 00:45:15,708
to torment you to bring them into being,

507
00:45:17,916 --> 00:45:20,208
I am but a victim of your obstinance.

508
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:27,000
And you, the true author
of your own torment.

509
00:45:33,208 --> 00:45:34,208
[scoffs]

510
00:45:35,083 --> 00:45:37,083
You truly are the Great Deceiver.

511
00:45:42,166 --> 00:45:44,083
You can deceive even yourself.

512
00:45:48,541 --> 00:45:49,958
Finish them.

513
00:46:13,375 --> 00:46:17,500

Release!

00:47:04,791 --> 00:47:05,791
[Elrond] Hurry!

00:47:21,041 --> 00:47:22,041
[gasps]

522
00:47:32,708 --> 00:47:33,791

[heart beating faintly]

536

[soldier 1]
Look what he's done to himself.

537
00:49:53,166 --> 00:49:55,250
[soldier 2] The old fool
really has gone mad.

538
00:49:55,916 --> 00:49:59,833
You are to remain in the tower,
so as not to be a danger to yourself.

539
00:50:00,541 --> 00:50:04,250
By order of Annatar. Lord of Eregion.

[groaning]

541
00:50:12,833 --> 00:50:13,958
[Galadriel] Release him.

[Commander Malendol] My lady?

543
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:22,750
That is Lord Celebrimbor.
Greatest of Elven-smiths.

544
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:26,250
-Release him.
-But the Lord of Eregion ordered--

545
00:50:26,333 --> 00:50:28,625
This is the Lord of Eregion.

546

Celebrimbor, it's me.

547
00:50:49,333 --> 00:50:50,541
Celebrimbor.

548
00:50:51,416 --> 00:50:53,000
When I saw you,

549
00:50:54,166 --> 00:50:57,125
for a moment, I was certain
that you were but another illusion,

550
00:50:58,750 --> 00:51:02,750
another cruelty devised to torment me
with false hope.

551
00:51:02,833 --> 00:51:03,958
Sauron?

552
00:51:06,208 --> 00:51:07,541
More Rings?

553
00:51:07,625 --> 00:51:08,875
Nine.

554
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:15,416
Nine Rings to enslave the world of Men.

555
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,750
As he... enslaved me.

556
00:51:21,416 --> 00:51:23,875
I-- It was my fault.

557
00:51:23,958 --> 00:51:24,958
No!

558
00:51:25,875 --> 00:51:29,750
From the beginning, a part of me... knew.

559
00:51:30,375 --> 00:51:34,041
A part of me saw. But I--
I wanted what he offered.

560
00:51:35,125 --> 00:51:40,291
So, I, I blinded myself to,
to what he was.

561
00:51:42,625 --> 00:51:43,958
So did I.

562
00:51:46,166 --> 00:51:47,708
[Sauron screams]

563
00:51:48,375 --> 00:51:50,375
-It is him.
-Hurry.

564
00:51:50,458 --> 00:51:54,583
The old Dwarven tunnel.
I used it to enter the city undetected.

565
00:51:54,666 --> 00:51:57,000
It will bear you and the Rings
far from here.

566
00:51:57,083 --> 00:51:58,083
No. No.

567
00:51:58,166 --> 00:51:59,458
Go! Now!

568
00:51:59,541 --> 00:52:01,625
I cannot. It must be you.

569
00:52:01,708 --> 00:52:04,541
He will realize what has happened.
He will come for the Rings.

570
00:52:04,625 --> 00:52:09,583
I will ensure it is some time
before that comes to pass.

571
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:15,666
Take the Rings,
save anyone in the city you can. Hurry!

572
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:16,833
No.

573
00:52:18,083 --> 00:52:20,333
I won't let you face him alone!

574
00:52:20,416 --> 00:52:23,166
I... I built this city.

575
00:52:25,083 --> 00:52:26,833
My place is here.

576
00:52:28,041 --> 00:52:29,875
[Commander Malendol]
And he will not be alone.

577
00:52:39,166 --> 00:52:42,250
I'm sorry. I brought him here.

578
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:46,708
I'm sorry I wasn't stronger.

579
00:52:47,208 --> 00:52:49,208
Neither of us was strong enough.

580
00:52:50,541 --> 00:52:53,291
There might not be anyone
in Middle-earth who is.

581
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,500
But perhaps, the Elves need only remember

582
00:53:00,916 --> 00:53:04,750
that it is not strength
that overcomes darkness,

583
00:53:06,541 --> 00:53:07,791
but light.

Won't they?

No, Rían! Our enemy will not
breach that wall!

595
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:41,375
A single arrow from you
may yet turn the tide.

-How many torch arrows do you have left?
-Enough to do my part.
