1
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:33,742
Come in close.

2
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:37,162
Closer.

3
00:00:38,247 --> 00:00:40,749
Because the more you think you see,

4
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:43,252
the easier it'll be to fool you.

5
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:46,838
I'm going to flip through this deck.

6
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:48,423
And I want you to see one card.

7
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:49,925
Not this one. That's too obvious.

8
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,635
Pay close attention.

9
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:55,514
That was too fast. I'll do it again.

10
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:56,807
Are you ready?

11
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:57,849
Okay.

12
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:01,687
- Now did you see one?
- Yes.

13
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:03,814
- Do you have one in mind?
- Yes.

14
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:05,691
Now, do you see your card here?

15
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:07,317
No.

16
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:09,611
That's because you're looking too closely.

17
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:11,738
And what have I been telling you all night?

18
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:13,282
The closer you look...

19
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:14,866
The less you see.

20
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:36,346
Now look into my eyes.

21
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:38,640
And sleep. Okay.

22
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:43,145
And...

23
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:46,857
If you can get this bill
from me, you can have it.

24
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:48,900
Go ahead. Take it. Get it.

25
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:51,653
If you can say your name, you can have it.

26
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:57,242
All right, just hang out there, wriggle a sec.

27
00:01:57,326 --> 00:01:59,703
I'm gonna take a little peek under the hood

28
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:01,330
-of your hubby's brain.
- Oh, no, no, no.

29
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,539
I'm picturing...

30
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:04,583
- Don't tell me.
- Of course.

31
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,835
Beach. Cocktails.

32
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:08,462
Florida?

33
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:10,047
Look, it was a business trip.

34
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,215
I mean, it is a kind of business.

35
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:15,177
Maybe the oldest business.

36
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,511
You know what, Honey Bee, let's...

37
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:18,096
She can't move, Mack.

38
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:19,598
You're thinking of a woman's name.

39
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,183
A, B, C,

40
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:22,517
D, E, F, G,

41
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,727
H, I, J...

42
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,604
J? Jean. Jane. Janet.

43
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:26,897
Who's Janet?

44
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:29,733
You know Janet?

45
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,109
It's not your best friend, is it?

46
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:34,154
- Your sister?
- No, please.

47
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:36,490
Her sister? Oh, my God.

48
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,617
You weren't away on business.

49
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,410
- You were away on Janet.
- No.

50
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:41,828
Your wife's sister!

51
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:44,039
Okay. Now she's gonna get upset.

52
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:45,207
Let's move over here.

53
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,501
You want this to go away?

54
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,211
- Yes.
- Okay, pull out your wallet.

55
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:51,254
Come on, get it out.

56
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:52,589
Do you shake down everybody like this?

57
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,508
No, only the special few.

58
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,635
What is this? Two hundred seem fair?

59
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,804
You know what?
This is a big deal. Let's go $250.

60
00:02:58,887 --> 00:02:59,888
You're a stick-up artist.

61
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,640
Yeah. Of course.

62
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:05,227
Okay, and sleep!

63
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:06,645
Now, when I snap my fingers,

64
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,230
you won't remember any of this.

65
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:09,481
And you, Warren Beatty,

66
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:12,609
every time you see or even think of Janet,

67
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:15,404
you're gonna picture me naked.

68
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:16,613
And that's not a pretty sight.

69
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:17,698
Yeah.

70
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:19,950
And... You're wide awake!

71
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:25,497
Well, we did the best we could,

72
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,791
but some people
just aren't to be hypnotized.

73
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:30,127
- I did it wrong?
- Come on, Honey Bee.

74
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:31,962
- Oh, no, you did it fine.
- Let me buy you dinner.

75
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:33,296
Look after her.

76
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,132
Just have to hit an ATM first.

77
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:47,936
Ladies and gentlemen,
I am the next great magician,

78
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:50,188
and I will give $100

79
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:52,607
to anyone who can tell me
how this trick is done.

80
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:56,319
I have an ordinary spoon from Mel's Deli,
right here in Brooklyn.

81
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:57,821
Check it out.

82
00:03:57,863 --> 00:04:01,533
Now, everyone
please pay very, very close attention.

83
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:05,162
Because I'm about to
bend this spoon with my mind.

84
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,716
Thank you. Thank you. Pass that around.

85
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,342
- What's this?
- What are you doing, man?

86
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:22,679
Look at this! Looks like
we got a spoon and a stem.

87
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:23,847
I've got other tricks.

88
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,183
Or you could give me my 100 bucks.

89
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:27,309
You said you would.

90
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:28,685
Nice wallet.

91
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:29,936
You have a very good eye, sir.

92
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,021
Thanks.

93
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:39,529
Wallet.

94
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,865
My wallet. My watch!

95
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:47,662
Stop that guy!

96
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:48,872
Stop that guy in the leather jacket!

97
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:49,915
He's got my wallet!

98
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,712
Okay, Los Angeles,

99
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:57,422
are we ready to end this thing?

100
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:58,507
Yeah!

101
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,634
When that timer hits zero,

102
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:03,428
a tank full of flesh-eating piranhas

103
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:05,472
will fall from above.

104
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:08,225
A lady has to have handcuffs. Right, girls?

105
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:11,228
One, two, three!

106
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:29,746
Yeah!

107
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,800
Help! Stop it!

108
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,470
She's serious! She can't get out!

109
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,057
Go get some help!

110
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:50,934
Help, dude!

111
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,771
Get out of the way! Move! Move!

112
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,684
Come on! This is bullshit!

113
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:36,021
Whoever thought of this is a sick sadist!

114
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:41,693
Yes!

115
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:45,071
I am your biggest fan.

116
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:47,073
I could tell by the way
you're attacking my face right now.

117
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:48,408
Close the door. Bad apartment building.

118
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,076
- Magician, come here.
- Okay.

119
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:53,747
- Wait, wait.
- What? What?

120
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,332
How did you do that...

121
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:56,708
The seven of diamonds
on the side of the tower?

122
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,335
- Yes.
- That's a trade secret.

123
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:02,797
I'll give you a hint. It involved
bribing the tower electrician.

124
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:04,007
How much?

125
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:05,050
50 bucks.

126
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:07,218
- But it's so hard.
- Oh, thank you.

127
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:08,428
Is it always a seven?

128
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,138
I could do that trick 52 different ways.

129
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,057
Can you do 52 different tricks on me?

130
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:13,558
I'll see what I can do.

131
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,518
Magic man!

132
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:17,312
I love your shampoo.

133
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:20,857
- Hold up.
- What?

134
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,277
You need to leave.

135
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:25,362
Are you kidding me?

136
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,572
Oh, my God, this is so embarrassing.

137
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:28,865
Is this what you do?

138
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:30,867
Some kind of sick trick you do to women?

139
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:33,161
"45 East Evan Street."

140
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:34,746
Don't worry about it. I'll call you.

141
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,331
You don't have my number.

142
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,583
I'm magic. I'll find it. Have a good night.

143
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:40,168
You are such an asshole.

144
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,115
Hey!

145
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,284
Henley.

146
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,661
Danny? Hey.

147
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:59,539
You got a card, huh?

148
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:02,792
No, no, no,
it's good for you. Congratulations.

149
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:03,835
All right, so here's what I'm gonna do,

150
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,253
I'm gonna go inside.
I'm gonna scope the place out.

151
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:06,504
You wait out here. I will come back

152
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:07,672
and get you, okay? Do not come in.

153
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:09,507
Hey, Danny! I'm not your assistant anymore.

154
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,134
Nice hair.

155
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:12,927
So, actually, what have you been up to?

156
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,138
I think you know exactly
what I've been up to, Danny.

157
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,974
I saw all your anonymous
posting on my website.

158
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:19,309
You have a website. That's good.

159
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,102
Good for you. Get the word out.

160
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:25,065
Okay.

161
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:28,318
So apparently none of us
was the only one chosen.

162
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:31,029
Let me be the first one
to kick my ego to the curb.

163
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:32,280
Yeah. Excuse me.

164
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:34,157
- Door's locked.
- Is it? I'll check.

165
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:36,826
You. Now, hold it, don't tell me.

166
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,495
Helen? No, no.

167
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,038
Henley.

168
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,331
It's on your coffee cup.

169
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:43,208
Thanks for keeping me honest.

170
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,834
That wasn't mentalism, by the way.

171
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,044
It was just an observation.

172
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:49,714
Second observation, you are beautiful.

173
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,174
Thank you.

174
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,843
That's good. That's very nice.
Very well-polished. Nice bit.

175
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:56,137
J. Daniel Atlas. Nice to meet you.

176
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:58,014
Very nice. I know
who you are and I just want to say that

177
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,140
I'm not interested in you doing

178
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:00,350
your mentalism thing on us.

179
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,894
Especially when we don't know
who brought us here or even if it's real.

180
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,649
Hold on, I'm sensing...
I'm sensing you are a control freak.

181
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,942
I'm sorry, have we met before?

182
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:10,610
It doesn't take a mentalist to figure that out.

183
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:11,736
You are a control freak.

184
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,029
Well, I take that as a compliment.

185
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:14,322
Only he would take it as a compliment.

186
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:15,865
Good. Another compliment.

187
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,534
So that's why you're no longer a couple.

188
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,743
A couple? No, no.

189
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,036
We were never a couple.

190
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:21,913
He used to saw me in half.

191
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,081
She was a very good assistant.

192
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,165
But I was too fat for Danny.

193
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:27,043
No. I said that one time
because of the trap door.

194
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:28,336
No one could fit through there. No one.

195
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:29,546
Rebecca fit through.

196
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,339
Rebecca fit for years.

197
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,007
Do you know how hard it is to stay

198
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,884
in those tiny little costumes?

199
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:37,095
No. I'm the main attraction.

200
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:39,347
Okay. So he never made you feel special.

201
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:43,351
And, trust me, you deserve
to be made to feel special.

202
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:44,853
That's a really nice story.

203
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,563
Hope you guys enjoy each other's company.

204
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:48,022
No way.

205
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,775
J. Daniel Atlas?

206
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,486
Dude, I've seen everything
that you have ever done.

207
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:54,863
You're like...

208
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,197
I idolize you. Seriously.

209
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:57,782
From a true fan. It's so nice to meet you.

210
00:10:57,866 --> 00:10:59,409
I'm Jack, by the way.

211
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:00,910
Question. Did you get one of these?

212
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:02,704
Yeah. Death.

213
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,747
The High Priestess.

214
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,082
I'm the Lover.

215
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:07,292
Three minutes.

216
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:09,377
Hermit.

217
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:12,213
So, what are we...
Are we waiting for someone?

218
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:13,882
- Why are we just...
- The door's locked.

219
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:16,467
Oh, no, nothing's ever locked.

220
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:27,937
What is this place?

221
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:33,985
Wow. Thought my apartment was nasty.

222
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:37,322
Man, it's freezing in here.

223
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,074
What's that?

224
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:41,451
I don't know.

225
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:45,747
What's it say?

226
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,499
"Now you don't."

227
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:52,629
"A rose by any other name..."

228
00:11:57,592 --> 00:11:59,802
Guys, what's happening?

229
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:02,972
Look at that.

230
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:10,813
It's gas!

231
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:13,149
Relax. Just dry ice.

232
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:14,943
Cool.

233
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,403
Wait. What do you think this is all about?

234
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:19,197
Hang on. Hang on.

235
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:25,161
I got nothin'.

236
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,121
Okay. Thank you. Thank you for the delay.

237
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,165
I'm just trying to create
the space for wisdom.

238
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:31,042
Danny, be honest. Did you do this?

239
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:32,418
No. Wait, did you?

240
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:33,836
I wish.

241
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:36,297
Why didn't anyone ask me if I did it?

242
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:38,716
Oh, great.

243
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,765
Electricity is out.

244
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:48,393
Well, let's check.

245
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:06,703
Blueprints.

246
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:08,913
They're incredible.

247
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:11,708
Who do you think did this?

248
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:14,043
I don't know, but I really want to meet them.

249
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,547
It's a show.

250
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,818
Merritt McKinney,

251
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:41,904
Daniel Atlas,

252
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:44,574
Henley Reeves,

253
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,244
Jack Wilder.

254
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:52,957
Arthur Tressler
and the MGM Grand proudly presents

255
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,795
The Four Horsemen.

256
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,673
Thank you.

257
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:02,925
Tonight we would like to try something

258
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:05,595
that will, well, set us a bit apart.

259
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:07,138
For our final trick,

260
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,223
we're gonna do something never before

261
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,267
seen on a Las Vegas stage.

262
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,645
Or any stage for that matter.

263
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:17,273
Ladies and gentlemen,

264
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,318
tonight

265
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,363
we are going to rob a bank.

266
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,084
That's a lot of excitement for a crime.

267
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:40,463
I'm getting excited.
What about you, people?

268
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:48,179
One, two, three!

269
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,815
Sorry, sir.
There's absolutely no recording allowed

270
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,149
during the performance.

271
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,276
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure, of course.

272
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,403
Let me just put this away.

273
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:04,821
Actually, I need to take that.

274
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,323
After the show, I can come
and give it back to you.

275
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,409
Okay.

276
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:14,247
Okay, okay.

277
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:16,332
Now, please, please, settle down.

278
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,919
Now who here has a bank
they would like us to rob?

279
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,172
That's a lot of people with a vendetta.

280
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,049
So we'll choose one at random then.

281
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:29,429
My associates will make sure
it's random. Right?

282
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:31,848
- Elvis, help me out, bud.
- Thank you very much.

283
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,600
In Jack's bowl
are ping pong balls with section numbers.

284
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:36,686
Jack, could you hand me a section number?

285
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:38,354
Thank you. We are looking at Section B.

286
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:39,605
Where is Section B?

287
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,733
Okay. There. It's gonna be
one of you guys. Get ready.

288
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:44,569
I don't know why everybody's happy.

289
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:45,695
It's only them.

290
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,572
Merritt, can I get a row, please?

291
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:49,449
Thank you, Merritt.

292
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:51,367
We are looking at row number 5.

293
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:52,535
Where is that?

294
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,455
And Henley, could I please
have a random seat number?

295
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,874
Oh. Lucky number 13.

296
00:15:58,124 --> 00:15:59,625
B-5-13. Where are you?

297
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:03,588
Sir, please, stand up. There you are. Hi.

298
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,883
Could you just confirm for me that this

299
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:09,010
is, in fact, your seat? B-5-13.

300
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,052
Yes.

301
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:12,138
Okay. Wonderful.
Now, could you please tell us

302
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,556
your name and the name of your bank?

303
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:15,975
Well, my name is Etienne Forcier.

304
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:19,562
And my bank,
it's Credit Republicain de Paris.

305
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:20,938
French. Okay.

306
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,732
We were hoping for something
a little more local,

307
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:25,067
a kind of mom-and-pop
credit union with no security.

308
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:27,195
But that's fine. A promise is a promise.

309
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:28,488
Could you please come up to the stage

310
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:29,864
and we'll rob your bank.

311
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:32,074
And while he does that...

312
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,409
There is someone here tonight

313
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:35,244
without whom we would just be

314
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,330
four magicians working the circuit,

315
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:38,414
trying to get...

316
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:39,999
Well, actually, trying to get here.

317
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,417
You probably know this man,

318
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:42,960
if not from one of the many, many

319
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,337
companies he puts his name on.

320
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,547
He is our friend. He is our benefactor.

321
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:47,924
Mr. Arthur Tressler.

322
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,092
Please, stand up, Art. Please, stand up.

323
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:51,219
The only man here with

324
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,387
the Queen's cell phone number.

325
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,932
Actually, please, stay standing, Art.

326
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:59,227
I want to say that
when we came to Mr. Tressler,

327
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,646
we promised that, as a unit,
we could become

328
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:02,855
the biggest name in magic.

329
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:04,398
So we wanted to say, "Thank you."

330
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,442
And by the way, Art,
you notice on the sign out front,

331
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,611
we made sure we put your name on top.

332
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:10,905
If you turn out to be as good

333
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:12,782
as you think you are, dear girl,

334
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:15,034
that won't be necessary much longer.

335
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:16,536
We haven't done our closer yet.

336
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:17,787
Why don't you watch it

337
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,205
and then you can decide for yourself.

338
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,791
Ladies and gentlemen, Arthur Tressler!

339
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:23,251
Thank you. And, of course, once again,

340
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,336
the Cardinal of Clairvoyance,
Merritt McKinney.

341
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:28,798
Etienne, what Jack
is bringing to the stage now,

342
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:32,635
is what we in the magic world
call a teleportation helmet.

343
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:34,887
You will need to wear this,
as it will allow you

344
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:38,891
to literally fold through space and time

345
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,310
to your bank in the...

346
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:42,520
8th?

347
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,647
-9th arrondissement.
- Yeah.

348
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:46,649
Now, once you are there,

349
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,818
we will be able to speak
with you through this helmet.

350
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,653
Now if...

351
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:52,655
Oh, my God, that's beautiful.

352
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:54,907
It has the added attraction
of being very stylish.

353
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:58,744
It's about time the French learned
from America on that subject.

354
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:01,497
Is that a beautiful piece of headgear?

355
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,165
- Thank you. Thank you...
- It is.

356
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,836
Thank you. Thank you very much.

357
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:09,547
But before you go anywhere,

358
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:11,674
could you please, pick a card, any card.

359
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,009
Not that card.

360
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:16,512
No, that's an old American joke.
You can take that one.

361
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:18,180
Okay. This one?

362
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,349
Show it to your friends in Section B.
But not to us.

363
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:24,061
Okay, great. Now if you could
just sign your name there.

364
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,606
- Yes.
- In English, if possible.

365
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:28,441
- That's good.
- Thanks.

366
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:30,693
Put it in your pocket.

367
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:33,446
And now for one tiny detail.

368
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,426
Now, Etienne, let's step into
this cockamamie contraption.

369
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:57,887
And I'll step off of it. Bonne chance.

370
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,723
It's 11 :50 p.m. here in Vegas.

371
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:03,059
That's 8:50 a.m. in Paris.

372
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,603
Your bank opens in less than 10 minutes.

373
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:06,854
One,

374
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:07,980
two...

375
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:09,106
Three.

376
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:13,569
What the fuck?

377
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:15,404
- Etienne?
- Etienne?

378
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,573
It wasn't supposed to happen
like that, was it?

379
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:18,866
Etienne?

380
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,243
I liked that little French guy.

381
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:22,495
Where did he go?

382
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:33,005
Wait, there he is.

383
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,343
No, no, no, no, please, please, please.

384
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:40,262
This is Daniel Atlas. Can you hear me?

385
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:41,597
Etienne? Are you okay?

386
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:42,765
Yes.

387
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,226
Perfect. What do you see in there?

388
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,270
Money.

389
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:49,939
Is this real?

390
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,483
Yes. Looks like three million
or so Euros' worth.

391
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:56,278
Okay, now, here's what
we're gonna need you to do.

392
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,322
I want you to take the card that you signed

393
00:19:58,406 --> 00:19:59,657
out of your pocket.

394
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:01,200
And I want you to take the ticket stub

395
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,326
from tonight's show

396
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:03,619
and I want you to put it right there

397
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:05,705
in the middle of the money.

398
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:09,959
Now drop it.

399
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:25,266
Now, on the side of your helmet
you should feel a button.

400
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,642
Don't press it just yet.

401
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:28,477
That button activates an air duct

402
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:31,313
that connects Paris to Las Vegas.

403
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,815
Okay, good. Now you can press it.

404
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:35,151
All right, now, Etienne, hold on tight.

405
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,610
You might feel a bit of a vacuum.

406
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,059
Wait a second.

407
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:52,269
Thank you, Etienne. Thank you, everyone!

408
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:53,604
We are The Four Horsemen.

409
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:54,980
And good night!

410
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:56,607
Good night!

411
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:10,120
Hold up here.

412
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:12,081
Dylan Rhodes.

413
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,709
What? I don't think I heard you correctly.

414
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,253
Did you say magicians?

415
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,255
Yeah, Dylan, magicians.

416
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,548
Where are you now?

417
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,591
I'm at Aria. I'm heading
up there to grab 'em now.

418
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:28,764
FBI! Hands where I can see them.

419
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:30,224
Let's go. Get 'em up. Come on.

420
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,310
Let's go. Get 'em up.

421
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:34,812
Put the book down.

422
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,772
Okay. You got me.

423
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:38,357
- Freeze! Hands in the air!
- Oh, my!

424
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:41,610
Do one of you guys
mind giving us a hand with our bags?

425
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,420
Boss, please tell me this is a joke.

426
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:02,548
I just got Willy Mears
to finger Paulie Attanasio.

427
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,300
I'm a month, two tops,

428
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,843
away from blowing this whole thing open.

429
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:06,969
Get Turkelson.

430
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,220
He's in Atlantic City.

431
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:09,513
What about Cowan? Look at him.

432
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,056
He's just sitting there on his ass.

433
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,308
Hilarious, Rhodes.

434
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:13,893
I love you.

435
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,311
Asshole.

436
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,062
I don't have time for this magic crap.

437
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:19,648
This crap just pulled
three million Euro out of a Parisian bank.

438
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:20,858
- That's how much they got?
- Yeah.

439
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:22,443
Actually, 3.2.

440
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:27,156
Who is she?

441
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:29,992
Alma Dray from Interpol.

442
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,660
I'll be working the investigation with you.

443
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:32,953
You gotta be kidding me.

444
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:34,580
It's bad enough they got me chasing down

445
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:35,831
David Copperfield and Friends.

446
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:39,168
Now I'm being saddled with,
no offense, with Interpol?

447
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:41,462
I look forward to working
with you, too, Agent Rhodes.

448
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:44,506
I'm sorry. I don't think I'm gonna
need your help on this. Okay?

449
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:47,176
- Where's the French guy?
- I already spoke to him.

450
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:49,762
Oh, you did? You spoke
to my witness before me?

451
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:52,973
Your witness? I thought
you didn't want the case.

452
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:54,600
Besides, he's useless.

453
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,518
Oh, really? Why is that?

454
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,854
Because he believes their magic was real.

455
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:00,564
Oh, he believes the magic was real?

456
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:02,149
You're right, he probably is useless.

457
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:05,569
Is it okay with Interpol if we talk to him, too?

458
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:07,196
Thank you.

459
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:11,033
I have never stolen a thing in my life, okay?

460
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,494
I tried to give
the money back, but they won't take it.

461
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:15,371
Okay, okay, Etienne.
Just 'cause I'm new to this,

462
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:16,914
can you explain to me how you went

463
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,291
from Las Vegas to Paris in three seconds?

464
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,961
With the teleportation helmet.

465
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:23,796
Okay, what the hell is going on here?

466
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,673
He was hypnotized during the show.

467
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,424
I told you, he's useless.

468
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:28,759
Okay, I'll deal with you when I'm done

469
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:30,386
with this other bullshit.

470
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,556
Hey!

471
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:36,392
During the show,
half the audience was hypnotized

472
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:37,893
to believe they were in the Philharmonic.

473
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,396
I guess that "bullshit" was the trigger word.

474
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,648
Okay. Écoutez, buddy. Come on down.

475
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:44,066
You're not in the Philharmonic.

476
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:46,568
- How do you say "stop" in French?
- Stop.

477
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:47,695
Tell him to stop.

478
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:51,991
No, I can't. You just have to
let him finish his movement.

479
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,243
Okay, I need a time-out.

480
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:55,786
Too many French people in one room.

481
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,413
Agent Rhodes!

482
00:24:57,496 --> 00:25:00,249
I'm ordered by my bosses
to provide a report.

483
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:03,377
And until we have one,
I'm here, like it or not.

484
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:04,753
So we can work together,

485
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:06,755
or you can continue to follow behind

486
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,966
asking the same exact questions I'm asking.

487
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:10,259
It's up to you.

488
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:15,514
I'm not finished.

489
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:19,435
I just flew 12 hours,
after what was already a long day.

490
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:21,812
And I do not handle jet lag well.

491
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,317
So if you want to see who can be grumpier,

492
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:29,528
I promise you, you will lose.

493
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:33,282
Fine. So which one of these idiots

494
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:34,783
do you want to talk to first?

495
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:35,868
Him?

496
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,123
Dylan, for the record,

497
00:25:41,165 --> 00:25:43,333
mentalism has never actually
been proven to be accurate.

498
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:44,460
Okay.

499
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:45,878
That is to say, that it's not a science.

500
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,046
It's more for entertainment.

501
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:48,380
All right.

502
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:51,800
Just don't believe
everything the guy says. That's all.

503
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:55,888
Please convey my deepest apologies

504
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,765
to your colleague out there.

505
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:00,184
I'm really sorry about this
whole Tranny Tuesday thing.

506
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:01,477
I was out of line.

507
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,811
Tranny Tuesday?

508
00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:04,563
Well, it's an arrangement
he and his wife have.

509
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:06,398
Or might not have, if you believe

510
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:08,942
everything Agent Fuller
is saying to be correct.

511
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:11,653
But isn't there a proud tradition in the FBI

512
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:13,614
of men wearing dresses?

513
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:17,910
No shame, Agent Fuller. No shame.

514
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:22,748
I'm just having fun.

515
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:25,417
So, if you had nothing to do with it,

516
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:28,087
then how did
the playing card get into the vault?

517
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:29,171
Oh, yes. That would be...

518
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:30,756
What do the kids call it these days?

519
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,007
Oh, yes, that's right. Magic.

520
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:34,093
Just answer the question, okay, smartass.

521
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:36,762
All right. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

522
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:39,681
You can keep that. Don't share it with him.

523
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:42,893
It says here you are a mentalist.

524
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:46,021
What exactly is mentalism?

525
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:49,191
Tricks, mostly. Some science.

526
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:53,237
Targeted guessing
might be a most apt description.

527
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:56,698
Along with some intuition
and the occasional...

528
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:00,035
Voices in my head.

529
00:27:01,078 --> 00:27:04,081
Says here you were
fairly famous at one point.

530
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:06,166
You can
even hypnotize people over the phone.

531
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:08,961
Some big tours
around the U.S. for a few years,

532
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:11,046
-two TV specials.
- Glory days.

533
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:14,716
Then your brother/manager disappeared
with all your hard-earned money.

534
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,135
Did your research, did you?

535
00:27:16,218 --> 00:27:18,053
IRS audit. Back taxes.

536
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:19,888
You've had a long hard slog back

537
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:22,391
into the limelight,
haven't you, Mr. McKinney?

538
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:27,146
Yes, indeed, it has. And I do appreciate
that trip down Memory Lane.

539
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:29,356
As far as I understand it,
when the man from Paris

540
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:30,566
put on the magical helmet...

541
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:31,650
Listen to me.

542
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:34,361
If you didn't rob that bank,
then you knew about it.

543
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:35,571
Which makes you an accomplice.

544
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:38,073
So if you wanna walk out of here
today, I'd suggest you start...

545
00:27:38,115 --> 00:27:39,158
Now you listen to me, unless you think

546
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:40,701
there's a D.A. in the state of Nevada

547
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,244
who'd be willing
to make sense of this to a jury,

548
00:27:42,286 --> 00:27:43,453
then we have a show to perform.

549
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:44,746
And you, Agent Rhodes,

550
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:46,123
have a drawing board to get back to.

551
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:47,666
Is this your first date?

552
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,918
What?

553
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,755
No, I mean, obviously, you guys don't
know each other well, if at all.

554
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:57,384
But, like,
there is a palpable tension in this room.

555
00:27:57,426 --> 00:27:59,261
And before you get involved,

556
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:02,848
you should consider the fact
that she has a lot of big secrets.

557
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:04,641
And I know the first one is that

558
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:07,853
this is your first time off the desk. Isn't it?

559
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,771
You should have said something to him.

560
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:12,024
This is a weird way for you to find out.

561
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:13,942
You are literally
begging to be arrested. You know that?

562
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:16,361
If it means you would
actually do it, then, yeah. But you won't.

563
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:17,946
Because if you did, it means that you,

564
00:28:17,988 --> 00:28:20,115
and the FBI, and your friends at Interpol,

565
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:23,619
actually believe,
at an institutional level, in magic.

566
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,330
The press would have a field day.

567
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,373
And we'd be even more famous
than we already are.

568
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:29,666
And you guys would look like idiots

569
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:30,959
even more then you already are.

570
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:33,170
Well, no, not you. But him. Right?

571
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:34,922
You have,
what we in the business, like to call,

572
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:36,632
"nothing up your sleeve."

573
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,966
And you know it.

574
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:40,135
Don't draw him in and then dump him

575
00:28:40,302 --> 00:28:43,680
because abandonment
is a big "area" for him.

576
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:45,349
Mommy?

577
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:47,309
Daddy.

578
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:48,977
You have big daddy issues.

579
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:50,687
- Okay, that's enough.
- I'll tell you what.

580
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:54,066
Your average therapist is gonna charge you
$200-$300 for this sesh.

581
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:56,485
Me? I'll take a tenner.

582
00:28:56,985 --> 00:29:00,113
Okay, later, if you're feeling magnanimous,

583
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:02,074
I'll still take a tenner.

584
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:04,326
You wanna know who sat
in that chair before you?

585
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:06,578
Mob bosses, murderers, and thieves.

586
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:08,247
And you know who put them there?

587
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:10,249
The guy who's sitting in this chair.

588
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:14,294
So I warn you,
I can maintain my resolve much longer

589
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:17,172
than you can maintain
that phony arrogance.

590
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:19,383
And the instant that you even show

591
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:22,177
the slightest crack in that smug facade,

592
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:23,512
I'll be there.

593
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,180
I will be all over you like...

594
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:26,431
Like white on rice?

595
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:28,225
Sorry. That's unfair.

596
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:29,393
Let me warn you.

597
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:30,602
I want you to follow.

598
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:32,187
Because no matter
what you think you might know,

599
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:33,772
we will always be one step, three steps,

600
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:34,898
seven steps ahead of you.

601
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,191
And just when you think
you're catching up,

602
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:37,693
that's when we'll be right behind you.

603
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:39,194
And at no time will you be
anywhere other than

604
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:40,362
exactly where I want you to be.

605
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,072
So come close. Get all over me

606
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:43,532
because the closer you think you are,

607
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,033
the less you'll actually see.

608
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:46,076
I'm gonna nail you...

609
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:52,874
Something wrong with that soda, Miss?

610
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,426
Oh! Shit!

611
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:04,553
First rule of magic.

612
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:07,597
Always be the smartest guy in the room.

613
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:27,451
Boss, what are we doing?
We're letting them go?

614
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,745
They all but admitted
they're gonna do it again.

615
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:31,830
About a half an hour ago,
you didn't give a damn about them.

616
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:33,665
- What changed?
- I met them.

617
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:34,750
Hey. Guys.

618
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,502
Hey, I ran a check on the audience.

619
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:38,754
Most of it was just filler.

620
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,547
People that Tressler
dragged in to pack the room.

621
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:42,424
But guess who was sitting there in the back,

622
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:43,633
filming the whole damn thing?

623
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:44,760
I don't know.

624
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,303
Thaddeus Bradley.

625
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:49,348
Thaddeus Bradley,
the guy from TV with the DVDs and shows?

626
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:50,432
No.

627
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,851
Okay, well, he debunks magicians.

628
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,770
He exposes them.
He shows you how to do their tricks.

629
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:55,937
Get him on the phone.

630
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:57,689
I did. You're having lunch with him in 45.

631
00:30:57,773 --> 00:30:58,815
Good.

632
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:00,650
So you were a magician first?

633
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:02,694
What made you jump over to this side?

634
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:06,114
Do you know how many people went
to see magic performed live

635
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:08,200
in the last half decade?

636
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,951
About 1 .6 million.

637
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:15,165
You know how many digital downloads
I sold in the same period?

638
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,293
Five million.

639
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:19,711
Isn't there a cost, though?

640
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:22,506
Careers.

641
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:24,174
Even lives.

642
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:26,635
I assume you're referring to Lionel Shrike.

643
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,220
I'm sorry, who's that?

644
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:30,972
Lionel Shrike.

645
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:34,309
A middling magician. A fool, really,

646
00:31:34,518 --> 00:31:37,604
who tried to make a name
for himself in the '70s.

647
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:40,607
My first show, I revealed all of his tricks.

648
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:43,819
Exposed him
for the two-bit hustler that he really was.

649
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:46,321
A year later, he tried to stage a comeback.

650
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,824
Had himself locked in a safe,

651
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:53,245
and dropped to the bottom of the East River.

652
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:55,497
But he never resurfaced.

653
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,832
The guy died in there?

654
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,875
The safe was never recovered.

655
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:00,752
Must have been great for ratings.

656
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:03,338
He attempted something
he was ill-prepared to handle.

657
00:32:03,547 --> 00:32:05,424
You're about to do the same thing.

658
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:09,010
But I assure you, Vegas was just a start.

659
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:13,014
New Orleans will be to draw you in
so you think you know their routine.

660
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:17,436
All the while, setting you
up for the big punch,

661
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,354
show number three.

662
00:32:19,563 --> 00:32:22,023
What makes you so certain
New Orleans is their next play?

663
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:25,360
What?

664
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:29,489
Flyer they passed out after the show.

665
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:31,783
You, my friend, are going to be played.

666
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:35,996
And your pathetic attempts
at fawning to gain my trust,

667
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:39,541
only show how really
far out of depth you are.

668
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:41,376
Okay. Here's the deal.

669
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,086
You're great at what you do.

670
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:45,380
We're trying to nail the same guys.

671
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:46,882
So why don't you give us a hand?

672
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:54,222
Now, why would I do that?

673
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:57,142
The longer you spin your wheels,

674
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:59,686
the more money I make.

675
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:01,313
How about I drag you in right now

676
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:04,065
on obstruction charges
and force you to tell me?

677
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,943
Unless what you're actually
really trying to say is,

678
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:09,571
you don't have any idea how they did it.

679
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:16,453
Showmanship and theatrics.

680
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,788
When a magician waves his hand and says,

681
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:20,499
"This is where the magic is happening."

682
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:23,168
The real trick is happening somewhere else.

683
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:26,630
Misdirection. A basic concept of magic.

684
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,090
Not interested in the concepts of magic.

685
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:30,800
I wanna know how they robbed a bank.

686
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:33,678
You're an idiot if you think
they robbed a bank.

687
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:35,180
But don't take my word for it.

688
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,349
How about a trip to Paris?

689
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:40,936
Hermia,
the teleportation helmet, please, darling?

690
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:42,771
You're joking, right?

691
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:45,232
You wanna know how they did it or not?

692
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:48,610
I'm just gonna put this on your head.

693
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:50,654
Step right up.

694
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:53,615
There you go.

695
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:57,953
Now we just pull this down
all safe and snug.

696
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:01,915
Make yourself comfortable. There we go.

697
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:04,125
And when you're ready to go to Paris,

698
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:06,294
just say the magic word.

699
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:07,796
Blow me?

700
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:10,549
- That'll suffice.
- Bon voyage.

701
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:25,689
I personally prefer to take the stairs to Paris.

702
00:34:26,356 --> 00:34:28,316
Welcome to the City of Light, Agent Rhodes.

703
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:30,277
Hardy har har. What was with the helmet?

704
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:31,861
My fun.

705
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:34,489
What?

706
00:34:34,531 --> 00:34:35,907
Nothing.

707
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:38,827
So they got a vault set.

708
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:39,995
Yes.

709
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,162
And it's the exact replica

710
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:42,414
of the little French guy's bank.

711
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:43,540
So he's a plant.

712
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:45,083
He was a dupe, not a plant.

713
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:47,335
They chose him. They knew
which seat he was in.

714
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:50,005
No, no, no, the audience picked the seat.

715
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:53,633
Unless, of course,
the audience didn't pick the seat.

716
00:34:53,675 --> 00:34:55,760
They let them think they picked the seat.

717
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:57,220
We'll choose one at random then.

718
00:34:57,721 --> 00:34:59,598
Actually, they were just palming the ball

719
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:01,391
with the seat number they wanted.

720
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:03,685
We are looking at row number 5.

721
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:05,186
Henley, could I please
have a seat number?

722
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:06,688
Lucky number 13.

723
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,857
Could you just confirm that this
is, in fact, your seat?

724
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:10,483
He was selected.

725
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:13,320
They programmed his mind
to make him go to Las Vegas.

726
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:14,529
Viva Las Vegas.

727
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:18,658
And then
they kept reinforcing it, until he did.

728
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:21,119
They trailed him.

729
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:22,370
They studied him.

730
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:24,164
Nothing was left to chance.

731
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:27,500
I got his measurements.

732
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:29,919
He had no idea he was their target.

733
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:32,172
And they simply activated him in Vegas.

734
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:33,548
When I snap my fingers...

735
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:36,217
And once again, Merritt McKinney.

736
00:35:36,343 --> 00:35:37,427
But how did they know what bank was his?

737
00:35:37,761 --> 00:35:38,887
- You're kidding.
- Really?

738
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:41,681
Can you be any more
of a condescending ass?

739
00:35:41,723 --> 00:35:42,724
Yes.

740
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:44,517
Like this.

741
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:48,980
There's a very rare, very mysterious way

742
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:52,567
in which a magician divines
an audience member's bank.

743
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:54,569
You ready?

744
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:55,987
Yes.

745
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:58,281
Credit card.

746
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:01,493
And that's how they got
the signature for the card

747
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:03,536
they left in the vault in Paris.

748
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,621
Very good.

749
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:06,331
You're being one-upped, Agent Rhodes.

750
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:09,459
Okay, but they had to get
the signature card in the vault.

751
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:11,086
You said they didn't steal the money.

752
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:12,879
No, I didn't say they didn't steal the money.

753
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:14,381
I said they didn't rob the bank.

754
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:17,550
My guess is that they targeted

755
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,260
a shipment of freshly minted money

756
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:23,264
headed to the Frenchman's bank
on-board an armored truck.

757
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:27,477
Which, of course,
is just as hard to break into.

758
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:30,230
Unless you're already inside.

759
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:48,998
And despite what the banks
would have you believe,

760
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:51,918
the men who drive
these trucks are not exactly mental giants.

761
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:55,171
For our Horsemen...

762
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:57,465
...it was almost too easy.

763
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:04,973
Hey, boys.

764
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:14,190
So, how did they make the phony money
disappear from the vault?

765
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:16,776
Flash paper.

766
00:37:18,987 --> 00:37:21,197
Magicians use it all the time.

767
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:29,205
Creates no smoke, leaves no residue.

768
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:37,005
Two days ago, no one heard of these guys,

769
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:39,758
but tonight's show sold out in 35 seconds.

770
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:42,302
I think these guys have cracked
the secret to show business.

771
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:45,096
Give your audience $3 million.

772
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:46,681
Puts 'em in a good mood, doesn't it?

773
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:48,016
Best finale ever.

774
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:50,518
They're gonna be
the first magicians in history to get laid.

775
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:53,104
Remember, if the oxygen mask comes down,

776
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:55,190
-put it on the lawyer first. Remember.
- Oh, yes.

777
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,609
I always do. It's lawyer first,

778
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:59,778
-then myself and then the children.
- Then yourself.

779
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:01,237
Yes. Then the children.

780
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:03,698
We'll be getting there a few minutes early.

781
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:04,866
So, sit back, relax.

782
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,701
We should be in the Big Easy soon.

783
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:08,495
Appreciate you flying with us today.

784
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:10,872
So, what's in it
for Tressler, besides the money?

785
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:12,123
Ego.

786
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:15,585
Okay, pick your card.

787
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:18,546
Look at it, put it in the deck, and tell me.

788
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:20,381
No, don't tell me.

789
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:22,217
- Okay.
- Okay.

790
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:23,885
Thaddeus was there that night.

791
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,387
He knows exactly
how they pulled it off. What about him?

792
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:28,181
You think they could be working together.

793
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:30,433
Like there's another
Horseman or something.

794
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:32,227
I don't know. All I know is that these guys

795
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:33,686
were a bunch of street magicians

796
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,355
a year ago with no resources.

797
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:37,690
So, how do they go from doing that to this

798
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:39,400
without some kind of outside help?

799
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:40,819
Is this your card?

800
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:43,822
No, my card is sitting
over there in that guy's lap.

801
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:45,865
Nice shuffle.

802
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:49,410
Allow me to make plain
what we've both been thinking.

803
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:50,703
And what's that?

804
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:53,873
Well, obviously, you have feelings
of affection for Daniel.

805
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:56,084
Unrequited and misguided,

806
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:59,045
owing to his lack of emotional availability.

807
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:01,798
Consequently, you're very tightly...

808
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:03,550
How should I put it?

809
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:05,093
Corked.

810
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:06,177
Oh, I am?

811
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:09,889
Now, recognizing that
you have physical needs not being met,

812
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:12,600
and strictly in the vein of
helping a sister out,

813
00:39:12,642 --> 00:39:17,355
I invite you to think
of me as your own personal corkscrew.

814
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:18,690
Wow. Thanks.

815
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:21,609
Let me mull over
that offer of cheap and meaningless sex.

816
00:39:21,651 --> 00:39:25,572
Cheap and meaningless, maybe,
but not time-consuming.

817
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,451
Is it magicians, in general,
you have a problem with?

818
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:32,620
Or specifically those guys?

819
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:36,124
I could care less about magicians in general.

820
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:39,085
What I hate is people
who exploit other people.

821
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:40,295
Exploit them how?

822
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:41,671
Try again.

823
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:44,716
By taking advantage of their weaknesses.

824
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:47,594
Their need
to believe in something that's unexplainable

825
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:50,513
in order to make their lives more bearable.

826
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:52,390
I see it as a strength.

827
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:54,434
My life is happier when I believe that.

828
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:56,853
Is this your card?

829
00:39:58,021 --> 00:39:59,147
Yeah.

830
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:01,065
Yeah?

831
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:02,692
- Yeah.
- Cool.

832
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:08,489
That smile on your face. Is it real?

833
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:09,782
Maybe.

834
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,660
So let me ask you, Mr. Detective Man.

835
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:14,162
Do you feel exploited?

836
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:17,498
Or did you have maybe
a tiny, tiny bit of fun?

837
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:21,002
Guy goes to the doctor.

838
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,170
Doctor says, "Sir, you're gonna

839
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:23,338
"have to stop masturbating."

840
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:24,380
He says, "Why?"

841
00:40:24,464 --> 00:40:25,924
He says, "So I can finish the examination."

842
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:27,091
Oh, Danny, can I talk to you about

843
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:28,718
-my role in the show real quick?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure.

844
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:30,053
Hey, guys.

845
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:31,930
We got a show to prepare for.

846
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:34,349
Do we now?

847
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:35,516
No, no, no, don't do that.

848
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:36,726
You're not doing that thing to me. No.

849
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:38,186
What thing? I'm just looking at you.

850
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:39,854
No, you're not.
I've been watching you for a year.

851
00:40:39,896 --> 00:40:41,272
I know all of your little tricks.

852
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:42,523
That what they are to you? Tricks?

853
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:44,359
Yes, it's gimmicks. It's Barnum statements.

854
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,110
It's reading the eyes. Body language. I get it.

855
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:47,862
If it's such an easy thing,
why don't you do Henley?

856
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:49,697
Yeah, Danny. Why don't you do me?

857
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:51,950
No, you're too easy. I'll do Jasmine.

858
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:53,534
No.

859
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:54,869
Do me.

860
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:56,371
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Do Art.

861
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:57,455
Okay.

862
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,623
Even better.

863
00:40:58,706 --> 00:40:59,707
- Art.
- Yeah.

864
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:01,584
But I warn you, I can be difficult to read,

865
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:02,710
when I want to be.

866
00:41:02,752 --> 00:41:04,963
Just stay with me, okay?

867
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:07,548
So, Art, you were a tough kid.

868
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,634
You know, kind of a real rapscallion.

869
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:11,678
You had a dog. A real tough dog.

870
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,638
A brutish breed. Like a real...

871
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,890
I want to say, Ben the bulldog.

872
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:18,393
Actually, I was a prissy little tot.

873
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:21,562
I had a fluffy white cat called Snuffles.

874
00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:24,399
Sorry.

875
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:25,733
Wait, let me try one.

876
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:26,901
- I can do way better than that.
- Let him do it.

877
00:41:26,943 --> 00:41:28,069
Come on, give me
one more time. One more time.

878
00:41:28,111 --> 00:41:29,737
He can do way better than that.

879
00:41:29,779 --> 00:41:30,780
Let's do family.

880
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:34,075
You had an uncle on your mother's side.

881
00:41:34,242 --> 00:41:36,869
He had a real, kind of...
A real masculine name.

882
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:39,163
A real, kind of, salt-of-the-earth...

883
00:41:39,247 --> 00:41:40,748
You know, a real stick-it-to-you...

884
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:45,003
Like it was some kind of Paul.
Thompson? Was it a Paul...

885
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,754
Okay. You know what? I got nothin'.

886
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:48,339
- Nearly though.
- Was I?

887
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:51,843
Yeah. My uncle's name
was Cushman Armitage.

888
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,594
Really? Snuffles and Cushman Armitage?

889
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:54,679
That was your childhood?

890
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:57,140
I certainly hope
tonight's show is gonna be better than this.

891
00:41:58,016 --> 00:42:00,143
Don't worry. Just you wait.

892
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,568
Hey. Come on, give me some good news
on a hotel room, please.

893
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:09,777
What, are you kidding me?

894
00:42:09,819 --> 00:42:11,362
No, it's Mardi Gras, Dylan.

895
00:42:11,446 --> 00:42:13,406
There's nothing within sight of the theater.

896
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:15,825
Hold on a second. Hold on.
Where is this woman?

897
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:19,662
Hey, hey! There you are.

898
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:21,330
What, the French girl
doing a little sightseeing

899
00:42:21,456 --> 00:42:22,457
while she's in New Orleans?

900
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,792
No. In fact, here, speaking French

901
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:26,544
is actually an asset.

902
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:28,129
Do you see that woman up there?

903
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:30,298
That's Marie Claire.

904
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,633
And she has a lovely apartment for us.

905
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:36,304
You're welcome.

906
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:37,972
Yeah.

907
00:42:38,014 --> 00:42:39,640
We got a place.

908
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,644
This other guy, Maximillian...

909
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:46,898
I am not interested in a history lesson
on magic at this moment.

910
00:42:47,148 --> 00:42:49,650
If you want to keep playing
into their hands, go for it.

911
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:51,652
I'm just
trying to understand how they think.

912
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:53,946
You think I'm playing
in their hands, do you?

913
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:56,824
I don't know how any of that
is gonna go against this.

914
00:42:56,866 --> 00:42:59,035
This what? This magic?

915
00:43:00,495 --> 00:43:01,829
Lionel Shrike.

916
00:43:02,038 --> 00:43:05,583
In Central Park,
he has a guy pick a card and sign it.

917
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:08,669
Then he goes to a tree
that has been there 20 years.

918
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:10,254
They saw the tree in half.

919
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:12,423
Inside the tree, encased in glass,

920
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:14,342
is the card with the signature.

921
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:15,551
How did he do that?

922
00:43:15,635 --> 00:43:18,971
I have no idea.
But I'm sure there's a logical explanation.

923
00:43:22,225 --> 00:43:23,684
You guys got a guy in that lobby yet?

924
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:25,311
No, but I do have some good news.

925
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,522
Remember how Atlas is such a control freak,

926
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:29,357
he's got his whole crew
on those tracking bracelets?

927
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:30,691
What tracking bracelets?

928
00:43:30,775 --> 00:43:32,026
He has every member of his crew

929
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:33,694
wearing a tracking bracelet.

930
00:43:33,778 --> 00:43:35,863
Those bracelets are on a sub-8 flat-band.

931
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:37,115
So as long as Atlas is tracking them...

932
00:43:37,198 --> 00:43:38,324
Next.

933
00:43:38,366 --> 00:43:39,492
...our boys can track Atlas

934
00:43:39,534 --> 00:43:40,993
from right here in the mobile command unit.

935
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:43,037
Okay, call me if you get any movement.

936
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:44,413
Copy that.

937
00:43:53,214 --> 00:43:55,591
You are missing the big picture here, Dylan.

938
00:43:56,926 --> 00:44:00,555
There is a place in Paris, Pont des Arts.

939
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:04,559
Sometimes in the mornings
I sit on a bench there.

940
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:06,602
And I watch the people make a wish

941
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:08,813
and lock it in a lock on the bridge.

942
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:11,566
Then throw the key into the Seine.

943
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:17,989
All day they do this.
Mothers, lovers, old men.

944
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:20,241
Watching the key sink into the water

945
00:44:20,283 --> 00:44:23,536
and their secret is locked away forever.

946
00:44:24,412 --> 00:44:28,749
Real and, at the same time, magical.

947
00:44:34,964 --> 00:44:36,090
So,

948
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:40,595
do you really think it's possible
there's a fifth Horseman?

949
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:43,347
Yeah.

950
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:51,689
There is a legend of a secret order

951
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:53,649
born in ancient Egypt called

952
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:55,401
"The Eye. "

953
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:59,614
It is said they perfected sleight of hand

954
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:01,782
to steal food from the Pharaohs

955
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:03,618
and give it to the slaves.

956
00:45:03,993 --> 00:45:05,244
Their purpose?

957
00:45:05,286 --> 00:45:09,290
Using magic
and illusion to even the scales of justice.

958
00:45:10,166 --> 00:45:14,503
Are The Horsemen next in a long line
of fools to believe this myth?

959
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:19,634
Will they evade the rules of law and logic
like they did in Las Vegas?

960
00:45:20,468 --> 00:45:24,722
Or will the dark mysticism
of this Southern swampland

961
00:45:25,306 --> 00:45:26,891
get the better of them?

962
00:45:33,314 --> 00:45:34,815
Bravo, Mr. Bradley.

963
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:36,984
Either you have a cease-and-desist,

964
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:39,362
which you don't, or you should leave.

965
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:43,324
If I want something to cease or desist,

966
00:45:44,492 --> 00:45:45,660
it does.

967
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:47,036
Take five.

968
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:49,163
According to your potential backers,

969
00:45:49,372 --> 00:45:53,000
you stand to make 2.5 million tops

970
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:54,710
from your best special.

971
00:45:54,919 --> 00:45:57,588
I have here a check

972
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:00,591
for 3.5 million.

973
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:01,842
To walk away?

974
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:05,680
To fly away. My jet is at your disposal.

975
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:10,518
Let's not kid ourselves, Mr. Tressler.

976
00:46:12,103 --> 00:46:14,188
You're in this to ride them up.

977
00:46:14,689 --> 00:46:16,691
I'm in it to ride them down.

978
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:20,027
I take it that we do not have a deal.

979
00:46:21,529 --> 00:46:25,866
And therein lies our conflict.

980
00:46:29,287 --> 00:46:30,538
Let me be blunt.

981
00:46:30,955 --> 00:46:35,418
My bank account
is much, much bigger than yours.

982
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:38,462
And my lawyers are much stronger.

983
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:41,882
And they will manacle you

984
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:44,969
with so many injunctions.

985
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:47,513
Until you stand by, hopelessly watching

986
00:46:47,555 --> 00:46:50,224
everything that you own drain away

987
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:53,561
in front of your greedy little eyes.

988
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:56,063
This isn't the first time I've been threatened.

989
00:46:56,230 --> 00:47:00,735
It is, however,
the first time you've been threatened by me.

990
00:47:02,445 --> 00:47:04,447
You shouldn't have done that.

991
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:07,450
According to superstition,

992
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:10,703
one who uses a doll
to enact one's own wrath,

993
00:47:10,745 --> 00:47:15,249
is likely to bring that
very wrath unto himself.

994
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:17,585
Isn't that funny?

995
00:47:18,419 --> 00:47:20,421
And I thought you didn't believe in magic.

996
00:47:26,427 --> 00:47:27,845
Ladies and gentlemen,

997
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:29,513
the Savoy management welcomes you

998
00:47:29,597 --> 00:47:31,140
to tonight's special performance,

999
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:33,934
The Four Horsemen, Act Two.

1000
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:36,103
Unlike traditional performances,

1001
00:47:36,312 --> 00:47:38,481
The Four Horsemen encourage you to film,

1002
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:39,565
call your friends,

1003
00:47:39,607 --> 00:47:42,610
upload, stream, and tweet the show freely.

1004
00:47:42,777 --> 00:47:46,197
Thank you. The show
will begin in a few minutes.

1005
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:52,370
By the way, I know how he did that trick.

1006
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:54,372
- Who?
- Shrike.

1007
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:56,707
So, when he was 14,

1008
00:47:56,791 --> 00:47:59,126
he saw a hole in a tree in Central Park.

1009
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:02,505
He had a guy who worked at the carousel

1010
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:06,300
sign a card for what looked
like a routine little trick.

1011
00:48:06,801 --> 00:48:10,805
At the guy's retirement, 18 years later,

1012
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:14,183
Shrike performs, has the guy sign a card,

1013
00:48:14,392 --> 00:48:16,060
and presto!

1014
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:17,645
The card is in the tree.

1015
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:19,563
It was in the tree for 18 years.

1016
00:48:19,647 --> 00:48:20,731
The card was in the tree.

1017
00:48:20,815 --> 00:48:23,818
The tree grew around the card in 18 years.
That's not magic.

1018
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:26,654
The point is, the trick
was not to look closely.

1019
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:28,656
It was to look so far

1020
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:31,492
that you see 20 years into the past.

1021
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:34,745
After Shrike drowned,
they never found the body.

1022
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:36,956
What are you suggesting?

1023
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:42,128
Arthur Tressler presents

1024
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:43,629
Jack Wilder,

1025
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:44,880
Henley Reeves,

1026
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:46,424
Merritt McKinney,

1027
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:48,175
and Daniel Atlas.

1028
00:48:48,384 --> 00:48:50,094
The Four Horsemen.

1029
00:48:55,516 --> 00:48:57,309
What is magic?

1030
00:48:57,518 --> 00:49:00,729
Our argument,
nothing but targeted deception.

1031
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:03,149
So I want you to look.

1032
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:05,776
Look as closely as possible.

1033
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:07,903
Because the tricks you are about to see

1034
00:49:08,446 --> 00:49:10,197
may not seem connected.

1035
00:49:10,239 --> 00:49:12,158
But we assure you, they are.

1036
00:49:13,117 --> 00:49:15,911
Is what follows 100 different tricks?

1037
00:49:16,245 --> 00:49:19,915
Or is it one giant illusion?

1038
00:49:27,548 --> 00:49:30,551
And now for one
of the oldest tricks in the book.

1039
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:32,845
Danny, if you wouldn't mind
opening up the box,

1040
00:49:32,887 --> 00:49:35,139
and showing everybody
that it's completely empty.

1041
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:39,351
Now, we're gonna need
12 courageous volunteers.

1042
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,854
I'm gonna take sweet little Fluffy here,

1043
00:49:41,896 --> 00:49:44,732
and put her inside this mystery box.

1044
00:49:45,149 --> 00:49:46,859
There are two pencils out there.

1045
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:48,235
Hold 'em up high. Let me see 'em.

1046
00:49:48,277 --> 00:49:49,737
- Here!
- Yeah!

1047
00:49:50,196 --> 00:49:52,198
And now, you will say the magic word.

1048
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:53,532
Abracadabra.

1049
00:49:53,574 --> 00:49:54,950
Yes, and I will wave this magic wand

1050
00:49:55,034 --> 00:49:56,619
for no reason. And then...

1051
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:59,121
Fluffy has
magically vanished before your very eyes.

1052
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:02,917
If you haven't experienced mass hypnosis,

1053
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,168
you're about to.

1054
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:05,544
And sleep.

1055
00:50:05,586 --> 00:50:08,464
Down, down. Sleep, sleep.
Completely sleep.

1056
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:10,132
Good, good. Sleep, sleep.

1057
00:50:10,216 --> 00:50:12,218
And now we are gonna debunk

1058
00:50:12,301 --> 00:50:14,428
a few magic myths this evening.

1059
00:50:14,512 --> 00:50:17,723
We all know that Fluffy is,
in fact, alive and well.

1060
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:20,559
And Fluffy has miraculously appeared.

1061
00:50:20,601 --> 00:50:22,102
As has the mirror

1062
00:50:22,186 --> 00:50:24,647
which makes the box only
appear as though it's empty.

1063
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:26,774
When you hear the word "freeze"

1064
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:29,193
you are all football players.

1065
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:32,196
And your job is to tackle,

1066
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:33,697
dismantle,

1067
00:50:33,906 --> 00:50:35,074
crush,

1068
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:37,493
tear limb from limb,

1069
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,620
the quarterback.

1070
00:50:50,673 --> 00:50:53,008
You will know who the quarterback is.

1071
00:50:53,217 --> 00:50:56,637
He will be the one saying that word.

1072
00:50:56,845 --> 00:50:57,972
Freeze.

1073
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:00,641
Three, two, one...

1074
00:51:07,356 --> 00:51:09,316
Put your hands in the middle.
One, two, three...

1075
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:10,818
Kill the quarterback!

1076
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:12,528
Get on back to your seats.

1077
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:14,863
I got a feeling
I'm gonna be seeing you soon.

1078
00:51:47,313 --> 00:51:48,939
I guess you have lost some weight.

1079
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:05,664
At the intermission,

1080
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:08,208
we asked you to write down
your current bank balance,

1081
00:52:08,417 --> 00:52:09,835
and seal it in an envelope.

1082
00:52:09,877 --> 00:52:11,503
Now it's time to take those envelopes out.

1083
00:52:11,587 --> 00:52:12,713
Everyone take 'em out.

1084
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:15,674
Now, everybody,

1085
00:52:15,716 --> 00:52:18,677
shout out your name. All at once. Go.

1086
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:21,930
Shout 'em out.

1087
00:52:24,016 --> 00:52:25,934
Clement? Frannick?

1088
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:28,228
- Yeah! Up here!
- Oh. Way up there.

1089
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:30,230
Okay. Dina? Robertson?

1090
00:52:30,439 --> 00:52:31,857
That's me!

1091
00:52:31,899 --> 00:52:34,234
Okay. Names. Names. Let's go.

1092
00:52:35,611 --> 00:52:37,571
Josepha Hickey?

1093
00:52:37,655 --> 00:52:38,697
That's me!

1094
00:52:38,739 --> 00:52:41,659
Josepha, I want you
to focus on your balance,

1095
00:52:41,784 --> 00:52:43,744
and count from one to 10 out loud.

1096
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:45,579
One, two, three, four, five...

1097
00:52:45,663 --> 00:52:46,914
Stop.

1098
00:52:47,206 --> 00:52:48,957
Is the first digit 5?

1099
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:50,042
Yes.

1100
00:52:50,084 --> 00:52:51,418
Do it again. This time, faster.

1101
00:52:51,502 --> 00:52:52,920
One, two, three, four, five, six...

1102
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:54,088
Stop.

1103
00:52:54,797 --> 00:52:56,298
Six. Again.

1104
00:52:56,382 --> 00:52:57,383
One, two...

1105
00:52:57,591 --> 00:53:01,553
Josepha, is your
bank balance $562 as of today?

1106
00:53:01,762 --> 00:53:03,931
Yeah. That's what I got.

1107
00:53:05,683 --> 00:53:07,226
Unfortunately, you're wrong.

1108
00:53:07,393 --> 00:53:08,435
Okay, Dina,

1109
00:53:10,354 --> 00:53:11,397
1 ,

1110
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:13,023
4,

1111
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:14,733
7,

1112
00:53:15,693 --> 00:53:17,319
-7.
- Yeah.

1113
00:53:17,403 --> 00:53:21,156
You think it is.
But in fact, you, too, are wrong.

1114
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,449
Clement.

1115
00:53:22,491 --> 00:53:25,452
You do not have $6,500 in your account.

1116
00:53:25,661 --> 00:53:29,456
In fact, everybody stand up. Everybody.

1117
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:34,253
Yeah. Put your envelopes to your forehead.

1118
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:37,214
Focus on your number.

1119
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:44,555
This is... Oh, dear. Just as I feared.

1120
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:46,849
Oh, this is strange.

1121
00:53:47,266 --> 00:53:50,436
You know, I hate to say this,
but you're all wrong.

1122
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:52,479
Every last one of you is dead wrong

1123
00:53:52,563 --> 00:53:54,690
about what you think is in your account.

1124
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:56,191
Okay, you can sit down now.

1125
00:53:56,817 --> 00:53:59,111
Yeah. I almost forgot.

1126
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:02,156
This evening would not be possible

1127
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:05,701
if it weren't
for our great benefactor Arthur Tressler.

1128
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:08,871
Big applause! Big applause!

1129
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:10,456
Art, actually, why don't
you come up on stage

1130
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:11,665
for the finale?

1131
00:54:11,749 --> 00:54:13,542
- Come on down, Art!
- Come on down, Art!

1132
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:15,544
There he goes. Okay, good.

1133
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:16,670
Are we on red?

1134
00:54:16,754 --> 00:54:18,839
Bright red. We're all standing by.

1135
00:54:18,881 --> 00:54:20,340
All right, no one leaves the theater. No one.

1136
00:54:20,424 --> 00:54:21,592
There he goes.

1137
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:24,428
Now, Art, did you fill out your envelope?

1138
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:26,346
Well, no need. We've done it for you.

1139
00:54:27,014 --> 00:54:29,850
Now, Art, I took a guess.

1140
00:54:29,892 --> 00:54:32,102
North of 140. Am I right?

1141
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:35,898
That's 140 million, by the way.

1142
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:40,527
I'm sorry, Merritt.

1143
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:42,654
How can he be right about his balance

1144
00:54:42,696 --> 00:54:43,864
and everyone else be wrong?

1145
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:47,367
I think possibly because he, too, is wrong.

1146
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:49,661
Everybody, take out your paper.

1147
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:52,372
And using the flashlight under your seat,

1148
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:54,374
start to warm up that paper.

1149
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:57,711
I think your correct balance
begins to appear.

1150
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:04,551
Now, Art, don't worry,
we have a flashlight for you.

1151
00:55:04,885 --> 00:55:05,928
Yes.

1152
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:14,061
Look.

1153
00:55:14,895 --> 00:55:16,230
What's going on there, Daniel?

1154
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:17,815
Wait. This is weird. A second ago, it said

1155
00:55:18,065 --> 00:55:21,860
$144,579,651 .

1156
00:55:21,902 --> 00:55:22,903
But now...

1157
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:26,448
Now it says $70,000 less.

1158
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:31,245
Josepha, can you stand up?

1159
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:32,329
Yes.

1160
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:34,248
Now, what is your new number?

1161
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:38,877
$70,562 now in my account.

1162
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:45,384
Is it possible that
Josepha's balance went up

1163
00:55:45,509 --> 00:55:47,594
the exact amount that Art's went down?

1164
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:50,222
Hey. Check it out. It's happening again.

1165
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:51,682
Is it?

1166
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:55,435
Wow. It is.

1167
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:58,939
Art's balance has gone down another 280K.

1168
00:55:59,106 --> 00:56:01,149
Dina Robertson? What did yours say?

1169
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:05,153
$281 ,477.

1170
00:56:08,991 --> 00:56:10,659
We have a confession to make.

1171
00:56:10,868 --> 00:56:12,870
She's right. We lied about something.

1172
00:56:12,953 --> 00:56:14,621
Yes. None of you were chosen at random.

1173
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:17,165
All of you have one thing in common.

1174
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:19,626
Everyone in this room was a victim

1175
00:56:19,668 --> 00:56:22,588
of the hard times that hit one of
America's most treasured cities.

1176
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:25,215
Some of you lost your houses, your cars.

1177
00:56:25,674 --> 00:56:26,675
Your businesses.

1178
00:56:26,842 --> 00:56:27,843
Your loved ones.

1179
00:56:27,968 --> 00:56:31,138
But all of you were insured
by the same company.

1180
00:56:31,305 --> 00:56:33,181
Tressler Insurance.

1181
00:56:34,308 --> 00:56:35,475
You were abandoned.

1182
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:36,643
You were loopholed...

1183
00:56:36,727 --> 00:56:37,936
...out of your settlements.

1184
00:56:39,313 --> 00:56:41,940
This is all for show. Correct?

1185
00:56:42,024 --> 00:56:44,568
"All" meaning we're doing it onstage
in front of a paying audience?

1186
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:46,486
- Then, yes, it's for show.
- Whoa! Whoa!

1187
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:49,281
I've got $82,000 in my bank account!

1188
00:56:49,448 --> 00:56:51,283
It says it right here on my cell phone!

1189
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:54,661
Everybody, look at your
cell phones right now! Everybody!

1190
00:57:02,461 --> 00:57:03,462
Is this for real?

1191
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:04,838
I don't know.

1192
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:06,214
Is this happening?

1193
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:07,966
I don't know! I can't tell!

1194
00:57:08,717 --> 00:57:10,844
Hey! Did you do this?

1195
00:57:12,054 --> 00:57:13,305
How could we, Art?

1196
00:57:13,347 --> 00:57:14,514
We don't have your password.

1197
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:16,183
We'd need access to information

1198
00:57:16,224 --> 00:57:18,143
we could never get our hands on.

1199
00:57:18,352 --> 00:57:20,312
Yes, security questions, for instance, like,

1200
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,064
I don't know, your mother's maiden name

1201
00:57:22,189 --> 00:57:23,690
or the name of your first pet.

1202
00:57:23,732 --> 00:57:25,525
Where would we get that information, Art?

1203
00:57:26,026 --> 00:57:27,653
You certainly would never tell us.

1204
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:32,532
We got confirmation.
It's really happening. They robbed him.

1205
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:36,370
Do not let them get away.

1206
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:38,413
Hey, we left you the jet and the Rolls.

1207
00:57:45,379 --> 00:57:46,713
You got hell to pay!

1208
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:50,717
Stop!

1209
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:53,220
Stop! Nobody move!

1210
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:56,264
Freeze!

1211
00:57:56,515 --> 00:57:58,058
Quarterback!

1212
00:58:00,936 --> 00:58:02,938
We are The Four Horsemen.

1213
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:04,523
Good night.

1214
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:18,120
Get 'em off me!

1215
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:20,580
Get off! Get off me!

1216
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:28,130
Get off me!

1217
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:38,598
All right. I want everyone
on the street! Everyone!

1218
00:58:42,102 --> 00:58:43,562
Fuller, meet me in front of the theater

1219
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:44,938
and bring the tracker.

1220
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:47,941
Let's go! Let's go! Now! Come on! Let's go!

1221
00:58:48,108 --> 00:58:49,234
Give me the tracker.

1222
00:58:49,693 --> 00:58:50,694
Let's go.

1223
00:58:54,906 --> 00:58:55,991
FBI! Clear!

1224
00:58:56,742 --> 00:58:57,951
- Dylan!
- Damn.

1225
00:58:57,993 --> 00:58:58,994
What have you got?

1226
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:00,662
That's him right there. Follow the red dot.

1227
00:59:00,746 --> 00:59:03,790
All right, I'll take this.
Go. Box 'em. Cut 'em off that way.

1228
00:59:05,292 --> 00:59:06,793
He's turning left on Burgundy.

1229
00:59:43,872 --> 00:59:45,165
Hey! Move!

1230
00:59:45,499 --> 00:59:46,833
Move! Move!

1231
00:59:49,336 --> 00:59:51,171
I got him heading north on Bourbon.

1232
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:53,006
- Sorry. Move, move!
- Hey!

1233
00:59:53,048 --> 00:59:55,050
Hey, excuse me. Move, move! Excuse me.

1234
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:07,813
I've lost him at Bourbon.

1235
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:12,109
Damn! Where are you?

1236
01:00:22,661 --> 01:00:23,870
Excuse me.

1237
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:31,962
He's heading south on Exchange Place.

1238
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:35,382
Stop!

1239
01:00:42,389 --> 01:00:43,723
What are you doing?

1240
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:49,312
He's going in Napoleon House.

1241
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:52,899
Move! Move!

1242
01:00:53,775 --> 01:00:55,318
Move out of the way!

1243
01:00:56,027 --> 01:00:57,028
Hey!

1244
01:00:57,863 --> 01:00:58,864
Move!

1245
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:03,451
He's in the bathroom.
I have him in the bathroom.

1246
01:01:03,577 --> 01:01:05,871
No! No! No!

1247
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:08,915
Freeze!

1248
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:11,042
Lower your weapons!

1249
01:01:11,293 --> 01:01:12,377
What?

1250
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:14,629
I'm tracking myself!

1251
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:17,090
The Horsemen
left egg on the face of what they call

1252
01:01:17,174 --> 01:01:18,884
the alphabet agencies,

1253
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:20,093
calling into question

1254
01:01:20,218 --> 01:01:22,470
the efficacy of the FBI's task force

1255
01:01:22,596 --> 01:01:25,307
as well as the man in charge
of the investigation,

1256
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:26,850
Special Agent Dylan Rhodes,

1257
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:28,602
who was publicly ridiculed,

1258
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:31,563
and even tackled at tonight's performance.

1259
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:33,231
Talk about a fumble.

1260
01:01:33,273 --> 01:01:35,108
This is quickly becoming a national story,

1261
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:38,195
as The Horsemen have now
seemingly pulled off the impossible

1262
01:01:38,403 --> 01:01:40,697
for the second time in as many days.

1263
01:01:40,947 --> 01:01:42,657
Two nights ago in Vegas, The Horsemen

1264
01:01:42,782 --> 01:01:44,159
seemingly robbed a bank in Paris...

1265
01:01:44,451 --> 01:01:45,619
Hey.

1266
01:01:46,786 --> 01:01:47,954
What are you doing?

1267
01:01:47,996 --> 01:01:49,372
I'm having a drink.

1268
01:01:52,459 --> 01:01:53,835
I came to get you.

1269
01:01:54,419 --> 01:01:55,629
I'm worried about you.

1270
01:01:55,795 --> 01:01:57,297
You're worried about me.
Well, I'm worried about you.

1271
01:01:57,422 --> 01:01:58,548
Atlas. You had him.

1272
01:01:58,632 --> 01:01:59,883
He didn't have a weapon.

1273
01:01:59,966 --> 01:02:01,468
I couldn't shoot him and you know that.

1274
01:02:01,593 --> 01:02:04,429
Yeah, but you... You let him go.

1275
01:02:04,596 --> 01:02:05,805
Didn't you?

1276
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:08,058
A pretty French girl
shows up out of the blue,

1277
01:02:08,141 --> 01:02:09,851
acts like she's my partner
and then she lets the bad guy go?

1278
01:02:09,935 --> 01:02:11,061
Let go of my arm.

1279
01:02:11,144 --> 01:02:12,812
Who exactly are you anyway?

1280
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:16,983
I thought you said you were a desk agent.

1281
01:02:22,030 --> 01:02:23,281
Not bad.

1282
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:26,201
What is this?

1283
01:02:29,204 --> 01:02:30,664
What's the Eye of Horus?

1284
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:33,833
Oh, certainly nothing
I want to get into tonight.

1285
01:02:33,959 --> 01:02:36,503
You're dismissive enough
about me when you're sober.

1286
01:02:37,003 --> 01:02:39,172
Find your way back yourself.

1287
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:46,346
Mr. Bradley? Mr. Tressler would like you
to join him for a drink.

1288
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:56,815
Sir.

1289
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:58,275
Thank you.

1290
01:02:59,651 --> 01:03:01,861
What is your role with them?

1291
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:03,029
Role?

1292
01:03:03,238 --> 01:03:04,990
Yes. You seem to know
everything about them.

1293
01:03:05,031 --> 01:03:06,825
What they're gonna do.
Where they're gonna be.

1294
01:03:07,033 --> 01:03:08,702
If it makes you feel any better,

1295
01:03:08,827 --> 01:03:10,036
this wasn't about you.

1296
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:13,581
Please tell me why this was not about me.

1297
01:03:14,332 --> 01:03:16,918
This is a magic trick, Mr. Tressler.

1298
01:03:17,168 --> 01:03:19,504
Played out on a global scale.

1299
01:03:19,879 --> 01:03:23,842
You, sir, are the abracadabra.

1300
01:03:24,384 --> 01:03:27,178
The distraction, while they
set up the real trick.

1301
01:03:27,387 --> 01:03:31,558
I was a $140-million distraction?

1302
01:03:32,392 --> 01:03:33,560
Yes.

1303
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:38,398
And that very ego that got you involved
with them in the first place

1304
01:03:38,857 --> 01:03:40,400
is what keeps you from seeing that.

1305
01:03:40,525 --> 01:03:42,068
- You know...
-"I can destroy you."

1306
01:03:42,193 --> 01:03:43,570
Yes, I do know.

1307
01:03:43,778 --> 01:03:45,071
Well, you won't.

1308
01:03:45,613 --> 01:03:47,782
And you won't destroy them.

1309
01:03:47,907 --> 01:03:49,951
Whatever this grand trick is,

1310
01:03:50,243 --> 01:03:53,038
it was designed a long time ago.

1311
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:57,792
And I believe that what's about to follow
is really going to amaze.

1312
01:03:58,626 --> 01:04:03,173
So I suggest
you sit back and enjoy your front row seat.

1313
01:04:03,631 --> 01:04:06,301
You paid quite a lot of good money for it.

1314
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:08,553
Whatever you stand to make

1315
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:14,225
I'll double it, if you expose them now.

1316
01:04:14,434 --> 01:04:15,810
And destroy them.

1317
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:18,229
I stand to make five million.

1318
01:04:18,938 --> 01:04:20,190
Am I flinching?

1319
01:04:22,317 --> 01:04:23,902
No, you're not.

1320
01:05:15,995 --> 01:05:17,038
Good morning.

1321
01:05:18,623 --> 01:05:20,917
I'm sorry. Good morning.

1322
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:23,002
I'm sorry for your arm.

1323
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:24,671
No.

1324
01:05:26,423 --> 01:05:28,550
I'm sorry I was a drunken asshole.

1325
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:32,554
And I'm completely lost in this case.

1326
01:05:32,637 --> 01:05:37,392
Will you please explain to me
what all this means?

1327
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:43,064
Okay. Sure.

1328
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:46,901
They are called "The Eye."

1329
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:50,280
Known for thousands of years

1330
01:05:50,488 --> 01:05:52,574
as the keepers and protectors

1331
01:05:52,657 --> 01:05:53,950
of real magic.

1332
01:05:55,285 --> 01:05:57,245
"Candidates for initiations

1333
01:05:57,328 --> 01:06:00,331
"must follow
a series of commands with blind obedience.

1334
01:06:01,166 --> 01:06:03,418
"For only by taking a leap of faith

1335
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:06,087
"will their eyes truly be opened

1336
01:06:06,171 --> 01:06:07,922
"to the world of miracles."

1337
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:11,384
So The Horsemen, the heists,

1338
01:06:11,593 --> 01:06:14,429
the shows, all of this is only to...

1339
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:16,055
To join "The Eye."

1340
01:06:16,347 --> 01:06:18,475
Come on.
Don't you think that's a little extreme?

1341
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:21,311
I mean, I had to pledge
at a fraternity at Rutgers

1342
01:06:21,394 --> 01:06:23,605
and all they asked from me
was to do four beer bongs

1343
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:26,149
and put a diaper on a squirrel.

1344
01:06:26,357 --> 01:06:27,358
What?

1345
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,819
I like squirrels. I'm not a frat guy.

1346
01:06:30,028 --> 01:06:31,488
It's just... Never mind, I'm an idiot.

1347
01:06:31,696 --> 01:06:33,031
A sweet one.

1348
01:06:35,408 --> 01:06:36,993
Have you ever

1349
01:06:38,453 --> 01:06:42,290
felt something that you can't see

1350
01:06:43,249 --> 01:06:45,043
but you know it's there?

1351
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:55,762
What?

1352
01:06:56,095 --> 01:06:57,972
- Shit!
- What?

1353
01:06:58,473 --> 01:07:00,016
Look, a bug.

1354
01:07:00,225 --> 01:07:04,062
Someone has
heard every call, read every text.

1355
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:05,522
That's how
they were able to stay ahead of us.

1356
01:07:05,605 --> 01:07:06,648
God damn it!

1357
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:09,484
Get me Atlas' interrogation tape.

1358
01:07:09,817 --> 01:07:11,361
Yes, sir. I have it on the hard drive.

1359
01:07:13,196 --> 01:07:14,280
Picture's up.

1360
01:07:14,739 --> 01:07:16,491
Okay, fast forward.

1361
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:18,326
Go on, go on. Freeze!

1362
01:07:19,118 --> 01:07:20,912
Okay. Frame by frame. Go on.

1363
01:07:21,788 --> 01:07:22,830
Play it through.

1364
01:07:23,957 --> 01:07:26,251
Stop. Zoom in tighter. Tighter.

1365
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:28,503
There. That's where he took my phone.

1366
01:07:29,796 --> 01:07:30,964
Is that thing transmitting?

1367
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:32,549
Only when
you're making a call or sending a text.

1368
01:07:32,757 --> 01:07:33,758
Plus I removed the bug.

1369
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:35,343
All right. Put it back in
and turn on the phone.

1370
01:07:35,593 --> 01:07:37,387
They don't know
that we know about the bug.

1371
01:07:37,595 --> 01:07:39,639
As of this instant, we are ahead of them.

1372
01:07:39,681 --> 01:07:41,808
We need to keep it that way. Understand?

1373
01:07:42,225 --> 01:07:43,560
Find my real phone and track it.

1374
01:07:43,643 --> 01:07:46,980
Already did. As of about 20 minutes ago,
it's in New York City.

1375
01:07:47,188 --> 01:07:48,231
Good.

1376
01:07:48,606 --> 01:07:50,316
I wanna cut 'em off at the knees.

1377
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:51,484
They got power? Cut it.

1378
01:07:51,693 --> 01:07:54,988
They got phones, electricity, water? Cut it.

1379
01:07:55,196 --> 01:07:56,239
Squeeze 'em out.

1380
01:07:56,322 --> 01:07:58,116
I want 'em to feel our presence.

1381
01:07:58,157 --> 01:07:59,659
And get me an airplane!

1382
01:08:02,412 --> 01:08:04,247
The firewall's down.
Do they know about this?

1383
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:05,331
They who?

1384
01:08:05,373 --> 01:08:07,166
"They," "them," whoever we're working for.

1385
01:08:07,375 --> 01:08:08,543
Who are we working for?

1386
01:08:08,668 --> 01:08:10,753
And are we prepared to go to jail for them?

1387
01:08:10,837 --> 01:08:11,838
Stop being paranoid.

1388
01:08:12,046 --> 01:08:13,131
It really does happen.

1389
01:08:13,339 --> 01:08:14,924
It happened to you.
Doesn't mean it's gonna happen to us.

1390
01:08:15,049 --> 01:08:16,634
Guys, I don't know if can do this, all right.

1391
01:08:16,718 --> 01:08:18,011
I don't want to go to jail, you know?

1392
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:19,887
Then don't screw up.
You're always talking about

1393
01:08:19,971 --> 01:08:21,180
wanting to be treated like an adult.

1394
01:08:21,264 --> 01:08:22,473
Now might be a good time
to start acting like one.

1395
01:08:22,515 --> 01:08:24,684
Stick to the plan. Stay here and burn it all.

1396
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:38,990
I don't know what I'm doing here.

1397
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:40,199
I don't know
what you would do anywhere else.

1398
01:08:40,241 --> 01:08:42,702
I'm here for the pot of gold
at the end of the rainbow.

1399
01:08:43,036 --> 01:08:45,163
That's it. Then I'm gone.

1400
01:08:45,246 --> 01:08:47,415
You can do whatever you want
when this is over, Merritt.

1401
01:08:47,624 --> 01:08:49,751
But until then, you stick to the plan.

1402
01:08:49,834 --> 01:08:51,878
Hey, guys. They're here.

1403
01:08:53,713 --> 01:08:55,715
- My guys are ready to go.
- Let's do this quickly...

1404
01:08:55,798 --> 01:08:57,091
- No.
- What?

1405
01:08:57,175 --> 01:08:58,384
She doesn't have jurisdiction here.

1406
01:08:58,635 --> 01:08:59,886
She's Interpol. She's with me.

1407
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:01,012
She stays.

1408
01:09:01,054 --> 01:09:02,388
What? What?

1409
01:09:02,430 --> 01:09:03,431
Stay in the car.

1410
01:09:05,683 --> 01:09:06,893
Let's go.

1411
01:09:12,523 --> 01:09:13,566
Okay. Let's do it.

1412
01:09:18,029 --> 01:09:19,030
FBI!

1413
01:09:23,284 --> 01:09:24,619
Ladies first.

1414
01:09:25,203 --> 01:09:26,412
Don't move!

1415
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:33,920
Tell me.

1416
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:35,755
Is my money being well-spent?

1417
01:09:36,255 --> 01:09:38,174
Exceedingly well.

1418
01:09:39,926 --> 01:09:41,427
Now you tell me,

1419
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:43,888
how do you like your Horsemen?

1420
01:09:44,055 --> 01:09:46,099
Fricasseed or fried?

1421
01:09:46,349 --> 01:09:47,392
Shredded.

1422
01:09:48,476 --> 01:09:49,936
I'll tell the chef.

1423
01:11:05,511 --> 01:11:06,512
Freeze!

1424
01:11:13,686 --> 01:11:14,687
Dylan!

1425
01:11:15,646 --> 01:11:16,814
Hold on!

1426
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:20,193
You little...

1427
01:11:24,697 --> 01:11:25,698
Come here!

1428
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:29,368
Five is clear. Standing by for six.

1429
01:11:29,577 --> 01:11:30,745
You little shit!

1430
01:11:30,828 --> 01:11:31,871
You little shit!

1431
01:11:31,913 --> 01:11:34,123
- What game are you playing?
- What game are you playing?

1432
01:11:34,457 --> 01:11:36,542
We're all good at six. Move to seven.

1433
01:11:36,584 --> 01:11:38,628
Copy that. Going to seven. Go, go, go!

1434
01:11:40,463 --> 01:11:41,589
Hey!

1435
01:11:43,341 --> 01:11:44,550
Come here!

1436
01:12:15,581 --> 01:12:16,749
Come here!

1437
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:18,543
All right, hold on, hold on!

1438
01:12:20,419 --> 01:12:22,255
- Really?
- Yup.

1439
01:12:26,259 --> 01:12:27,260
You...

1440
01:12:30,721 --> 01:12:32,181
You little...

1441
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:45,444
Shit!

1442
01:13:03,796 --> 01:13:04,839
Shit!

1443
01:13:06,257 --> 01:13:07,633
Give me that!

1444
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:27,320
All units, cover the north exit now!

1445
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:28,821
Clear on Evan.

1446
01:13:28,863 --> 01:13:30,656
Block every possible exit.

1447
01:13:30,698 --> 01:13:31,949
Hey! Get back. Shit.

1448
01:13:33,784 --> 01:13:35,912
- FBI. Sort of. I need your car. Thanks.
- What?

1449
01:13:35,995 --> 01:13:36,996
What?

1450
01:13:38,956 --> 01:13:40,583
Stop! Stop!

1451
01:13:56,724 --> 01:13:57,767
Hey!

1452
01:14:27,672 --> 01:14:28,673
Good. Follow him!

1453
01:14:28,756 --> 01:14:31,676
Don't ever tell me to stay in the car. Ever.

1454
01:14:31,717 --> 01:14:32,969
Fine! Now go!

1455
01:14:57,785 --> 01:14:58,828
There he is!

1456
01:15:09,964 --> 01:15:10,965
Move!

1457
01:15:15,469 --> 01:15:16,512
Left!

1458
01:15:19,015 --> 01:15:20,683
We're heading east on the FDR Drive.

1459
01:15:20,766 --> 01:15:22,685
- This is not east.
- North! North!

1460
01:15:22,935 --> 01:15:24,979
We're coming to you live above the FDR,

1461
01:15:25,062 --> 01:15:27,982
where NYPD
and federal agents, as you now see,

1462
01:15:28,065 --> 01:15:29,942
are engaged in a high-speed pursuit,

1463
01:15:30,067 --> 01:15:31,277
following a black sedan.

1464
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:37,241
Fuller, where are you?

1465
01:15:37,742 --> 01:15:39,410
Right here. Trying to catch up to you now.

1466
01:15:39,618 --> 01:15:41,620
We're now trying to get you a better shot.

1467
01:15:44,123 --> 01:15:45,249
Come on!

1468
01:15:50,921 --> 01:15:52,089
It looks like they're turning

1469
01:15:52,131 --> 01:15:54,258
onto the 59th Street Bridge.

1470
01:15:56,302 --> 01:15:57,803
As soon as we have them within range,

1471
01:15:57,970 --> 01:15:59,805
we will bring you those pictures live.

1472
01:16:05,311 --> 01:16:06,520
Good. Just stay with him.

1473
01:16:13,903 --> 01:16:15,154
Go, go, go!

1474
01:16:19,158 --> 01:16:20,701
Behind... You're behind the bus!

1475
01:16:24,288 --> 01:16:25,331
Get over!

1476
01:16:28,918 --> 01:16:29,960
Oh, shit!

1477
01:16:50,523 --> 01:16:51,524
Come here!

1478
01:16:52,775 --> 01:16:54,193
Get back! Get back!

1479
01:16:55,694 --> 01:16:56,987
Dylan, let's go, man!

1480
01:16:57,196 --> 01:16:58,197
Come on, you...

1481
01:16:59,698 --> 01:17:01,742
- Come on, man! Get out!
- He's gonna die in here.

1482
01:17:01,826 --> 01:17:03,202
Leave him! There's nothing you can do!

1483
01:17:03,285 --> 01:17:05,204
Let's go! Leave him!

1484
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,377
- The paper!
- Dylan!

1485
01:17:11,627 --> 01:17:13,546
Let's go! Let's go! Come on!

1486
01:17:48,247 --> 01:17:50,958
Dylan, they just
figured out what the paper was in Jack's car.

1487
01:17:51,041 --> 01:17:52,334
So they know what it is?

1488
01:17:52,418 --> 01:17:54,128
And why the kid died trying to protect it.

1489
01:17:54,211 --> 01:17:55,880
Evans is on his way to brief us right now.

1490
01:17:55,921 --> 01:17:57,506
Let's go.

1491
01:17:57,590 --> 01:17:58,924
You're gonna wanna take this first, though.

1492
01:17:58,966 --> 01:17:59,967
What's that?

1493
01:18:00,050 --> 01:18:02,344
Your friend Thaddeus Bradley.

1494
01:18:02,845 --> 01:18:03,846
Rhodes.

1495
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:05,764
You do understand the function

1496
01:18:05,890 --> 01:18:08,017
of the magician's assistant,
don't you, Agent Rhodes?

1497
01:18:08,225 --> 01:18:09,810
Yeah, she's there to distract them

1498
01:18:09,894 --> 01:18:11,103
while he sets up the trick.

1499
01:18:12,271 --> 01:18:14,440
You'd be right if you weren't so wrong.

1500
01:18:14,857 --> 01:18:16,609
While you're watching the magician,

1501
01:18:17,443 --> 01:18:19,695
that lovely innocent
is actually pulling the strings.

1502
01:18:19,904 --> 01:18:23,032
Don't you find it peculiar
that Interpol would send you

1503
01:18:23,115 --> 01:18:26,577
a first timer off the desk
to be your assistant?

1504
01:18:27,036 --> 01:18:29,205
Why did she request to be put on the case?

1505
01:18:29,622 --> 01:18:31,540
She was assigned to the case.

1506
01:18:32,416 --> 01:18:33,792
Luck of the draw.

1507
01:18:34,376 --> 01:18:37,463
Like choosing a random card in the deck.

1508
01:18:37,630 --> 01:18:41,217
I find it odd, your sudden act of generosity.

1509
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:42,426
What's in it for you?

1510
01:18:42,593 --> 01:18:44,428
Just trying to even the game.

1511
01:18:44,637 --> 01:18:48,641
I feel like I'm playing with somebody
wearing ankle weights and flippers.

1512
01:18:49,808 --> 01:18:53,562
Keep up, Agent Rhodes. Keep up.

1513
01:18:57,399 --> 01:18:58,484
Hey.

1514
01:18:58,776 --> 01:18:59,985
We got a problem.

1515
01:19:01,153 --> 01:19:02,279
Here's the safe.

1516
01:19:02,321 --> 01:19:03,781
No, no, no. Hey.

1517
01:19:03,864 --> 01:19:05,157
What's he doing here?

1518
01:19:05,324 --> 01:19:06,909
Giving us our first solid lead.

1519
01:19:06,992 --> 01:19:08,869
We've been investigating
a private security contractor

1520
01:19:08,953 --> 01:19:10,162
called Elkhorn

1521
01:19:10,204 --> 01:19:12,164
-for the last five years.
- And?

1522
01:19:12,248 --> 01:19:13,916
They've been hiding close
to a half billion dollars...

1523
01:19:13,999 --> 01:19:16,460
I didn't ask you. I asked him.

1524
01:19:16,835 --> 01:19:19,171
The money's in a vault inside
a warehouse in Queens.

1525
01:19:19,338 --> 01:19:21,840
We think this vault
is your magicians' final target.

1526
01:19:22,007 --> 01:19:23,968
The magician who died on the bridge...

1527
01:19:24,009 --> 01:19:27,471
You pulled our classified Elkhorn file
right from his crispy little hand.

1528
01:19:27,846 --> 01:19:29,848
And despite their bullshit
Robin Hood razzle-dazzle,

1529
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:32,017
your magicians are nothing
more than common thieves.

1530
01:19:32,101 --> 01:19:33,310
How did they get the file?

1531
01:19:34,603 --> 01:19:35,604
This is the part you're gonna find

1532
01:19:35,688 --> 01:19:37,648
particularly interesting, Agent Rhodes.

1533
01:19:37,856 --> 01:19:40,192
They patched to my server
after they accessed

1534
01:19:40,234 --> 01:19:42,528
your mobile command center
in New Orleans

1535
01:19:42,611 --> 01:19:44,196
with codes they got from your phone.

1536
01:19:46,365 --> 01:19:48,200
You ordered us all out to chase after them.

1537
01:19:48,617 --> 01:19:51,203
The level of incompetence
displayed on this case,

1538
01:19:51,287 --> 01:19:53,789
that's a magic trick in and of itself.

1539
01:19:53,872 --> 01:19:56,125
Abracadabra. I'm taking over.

1540
01:19:57,543 --> 01:19:59,461
Boss, he's taking over?

1541
01:20:00,004 --> 01:20:02,006
Let's go, gentlemen.

1542
01:20:03,382 --> 01:20:04,758
Hey.

1543
01:20:04,883 --> 01:20:06,385
Hey. I want to have a word with you.

1544
01:20:06,468 --> 01:20:07,636
Don't ever talk to me like that again.

1545
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:09,763
- Why the hell did you take this case?
- What?

1546
01:20:09,847 --> 01:20:12,016
People say I'm "hard to read."
That's an American expression.

1547
01:20:12,099 --> 01:20:13,559
Do you understand it?

1548
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:14,643
Yes.

1549
01:20:14,727 --> 01:20:17,021
Good, then let me make myself
perfectly clear to you.

1550
01:20:17,062 --> 01:20:19,481
If I find out that you are anything other than

1551
01:20:19,565 --> 01:20:20,733
who you say you are, I swear...

1552
01:20:20,816 --> 01:20:22,568
And we French also have an expression.

1553
01:20:24,570 --> 01:20:26,155
"Faith can move mountains."

1554
01:20:26,363 --> 01:20:28,073
If we hope to capture The Horsemen,

1555
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:29,992
then you need to have a little faith in me.

1556
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:32,202
Because I've done nothing
to deserve otherwise.

1557
01:20:32,411 --> 01:20:35,039
I just got my ass handed to me.

1558
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:36,665
I am losing this case.

1559
01:20:36,749 --> 01:20:40,085
So faith is a luxury
I don't have any time for right now.

1560
01:20:52,097 --> 01:20:53,307
Approaching the warehouse.

1561
01:20:53,390 --> 01:20:56,101
Units 5 and 6
cover the north and south entrances.

1562
01:20:56,185 --> 01:20:57,436
We are going for the vault.

1563
01:21:02,274 --> 01:21:05,194
Hey. Where's the safe? Where's the safe?

1564
01:21:09,406 --> 01:21:10,407
What is this?

1565
01:21:10,449 --> 01:21:11,784
Where the hell is the goddamn safe?

1566
01:21:11,950 --> 01:21:13,702
We just moved it while you were outside.

1567
01:21:13,869 --> 01:21:15,079
- Evans' orders.
- What?

1568
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:16,205
I never said that.

1569
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:17,623
Sir, you got a phone call

1570
01:21:17,706 --> 01:21:19,333
and said Washington wants the safe moved.

1571
01:21:19,416 --> 01:21:21,460
You never heard that
come out of my mouth, agent.

1572
01:21:21,585 --> 01:21:22,586
What happened?

1573
01:21:22,628 --> 01:21:24,880
You tell me what's going on,
because this is bullshit!

1574
01:21:24,963 --> 01:21:26,048
No!

1575
01:21:31,929 --> 01:21:33,430
Jesus Christ.

1576
01:21:33,639 --> 01:21:36,642
Sir? Sir? What are you doing?

1577
01:21:36,683 --> 01:21:38,560
I think it's Beethoven's Concerto in D-Major.

1578
01:21:38,644 --> 01:21:39,645
Where's the safe?

1579
01:21:39,728 --> 01:21:40,813
His team is loading the truck.

1580
01:21:45,109 --> 01:21:46,777
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey!

1581
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:49,488
- Stop the truck!
- Stop!

1582
01:21:50,489 --> 01:21:52,658
- Stop!
- Hey! Stop that truck!

1583
01:22:01,291 --> 01:22:03,168
What the hell's going on?
We got our orders.

1584
01:22:03,252 --> 01:22:05,003
Now you've got new orders. Open it up.

1585
01:22:08,966 --> 01:22:10,759
Okay. Here's what I want.

1586
01:22:10,843 --> 01:22:13,095
At this moment,
they think that safe's leaving this site.

1587
01:22:13,345 --> 01:22:14,513
So we stay with it.

1588
01:22:14,555 --> 01:22:16,473
We follow it
all the way to... Where's it going?

1589
01:22:16,723 --> 01:22:17,808
5 Pointz. Up the street.

1590
01:22:18,267 --> 01:22:21,145
So we go to 5 Pointz.
Wherever the safe goes, we go.

1591
01:22:21,353 --> 01:22:22,438
It'll lead us right to 'em.

1592
01:22:23,355 --> 01:22:24,523
You two are with me.

1593
01:22:37,161 --> 01:22:38,412
Guys.

1594
01:22:39,371 --> 01:22:41,874
Look. Office just called with this.

1595
01:22:41,957 --> 01:22:43,834
Horsemen posted it to YouTube
20 minutes ago.

1596
01:22:44,209 --> 01:22:47,796
The point of why we're here
is to say that we are not...

1597
01:22:48,046 --> 01:22:49,882
We cannot quit now.

1598
01:22:50,048 --> 01:22:52,551
We've started something
bigger than all of us.

1599
01:22:52,718 --> 01:22:54,303
We have to finish it.

1600
01:22:54,386 --> 01:22:56,930
Remember the name Jack Wilder
when you see us live,

1601
01:22:57,014 --> 01:22:58,891
5 Pointz, Queens, 7:00.

1602
01:22:59,141 --> 01:23:00,225
Their show is in a half an hour.

1603
01:23:00,309 --> 01:23:01,560
It's exactly where we're headed.

1604
01:23:01,727 --> 01:23:03,854
I don't know, boss.
I don't wanna be the naysayer,

1605
01:23:04,062 --> 01:23:06,064
but these guys are kinda tricky.

1606
01:23:06,106 --> 01:23:08,734
Rhodes, they're entertainers.

1607
01:23:11,236 --> 01:23:13,405
A stunning turnout here in 5 Pointz

1608
01:23:13,489 --> 01:23:17,326
as the renegade Horsemen
taunt the FBI into a final showdown.

1609
01:23:17,409 --> 01:23:18,827
The Horsemen have invited
us to their final round

1610
01:23:18,911 --> 01:23:21,079
of their three-act face-off with the FBI.

1611
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:24,917
What do they have in store?
We're about to find out.

1612
01:23:36,261 --> 01:23:38,555
All eyes on the truck.
Let's see who approaches.

1613
01:23:38,597 --> 01:23:39,932
Copy that.

1614
01:23:56,114 --> 01:23:57,950
Agents Rhodes, Fuller?

1615
01:23:58,617 --> 01:23:59,618
Go, for us.

1616
01:23:59,785 --> 01:24:02,412
We've got movement.
Someone's walking toward the truck.

1617
01:24:02,538 --> 01:24:03,997
It's a woman.

1618
01:24:07,751 --> 01:24:08,919
- Freeze!
- Oh, shit!

1619
01:24:10,712 --> 01:24:12,214
What the hell's going on?

1620
01:24:13,298 --> 01:24:15,634
Hey! It's the guy from the TV.

1621
01:24:15,717 --> 01:24:16,760
Put your guns down.

1622
01:24:16,969 --> 01:24:19,805
Look who it is. The fifth Horseman.

1623
01:24:19,972 --> 01:24:20,973
Are you kidding?

1624
01:24:21,056 --> 01:24:22,891
I'm following them, just like you are.

1625
01:24:22,975 --> 01:24:24,601
I'm not following anybody anymore.

1626
01:24:24,643 --> 01:24:26,395
You've been ahead of us this whole time.

1627
01:24:26,478 --> 01:24:28,105
But guess what? I'm ahead of you now.

1628
01:24:28,313 --> 01:24:29,940
Your ass is mine.

1629
01:24:30,148 --> 01:24:31,900
You guys are still idiots.

1630
01:24:32,109 --> 01:24:33,151
Yeah?

1631
01:24:33,235 --> 01:24:34,319
This happens to be the former

1632
01:24:34,444 --> 01:24:36,488
rehearsal space for Lionel Shrike.

1633
01:24:36,947 --> 01:24:38,782
It's where I did my first show.

1634
01:24:38,991 --> 01:24:41,785
Now, if you wanna look
like even bigger idiots,

1635
01:24:41,994 --> 01:24:43,245
why not open it?

1636
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:45,247
And while you're doing it, Agent Rhodes,

1637
01:24:45,539 --> 01:24:47,165
would you mind reenacting your look

1638
01:24:47,374 --> 01:24:49,293
of absolute befuddlement for me?

1639
01:24:49,459 --> 01:24:51,545
It will make a wonderful cover for my DVD.

1640
01:24:52,879 --> 01:24:54,172
Open the safe.

1641
01:24:54,214 --> 01:24:55,716
- Go ahead.
- Open it.

1642
01:25:00,053 --> 01:25:01,096
What the hell?

1643
01:25:03,515 --> 01:25:04,600
What?

1644
01:25:04,850 --> 01:25:05,934
Give me that.

1645
01:25:06,143 --> 01:25:07,185
No.

1646
01:25:07,352 --> 01:25:08,353
No!

1647
01:25:12,983 --> 01:25:14,026
What is this?

1648
01:25:15,152 --> 01:25:16,153
Get back!

1649
01:25:23,744 --> 01:25:25,871
Who doesn't love a good magic trick?

1650
01:25:26,538 --> 01:25:28,874
They have you chasing empty safes again.

1651
01:25:30,208 --> 01:25:33,378
Once again, misdirection.

1652
01:25:40,344 --> 01:25:42,012
The show is starting. Move out!

1653
01:25:42,054 --> 01:25:44,556
The question
I'd be asking now, Agent Rhodes is,

1654
01:25:45,057 --> 01:25:47,184
"What happened to the real one?"

1655
01:26:07,829 --> 01:26:09,581
Clear! Clear 'em out!

1656
01:26:09,665 --> 01:26:11,249
Come on. Move 'em out.
Move 'em out of the way.

1657
01:26:12,668 --> 01:26:14,544
FBI! Give me a path!

1658
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:16,755
Clear out! Clear out!

1659
01:26:17,005 --> 01:26:18,382
What is magic?

1660
01:26:19,216 --> 01:26:20,258
Magic is deception.

1661
01:26:20,384 --> 01:26:22,094
But deception designed to delight,

1662
01:26:22,344 --> 01:26:24,012
to entertain, to inspire.

1663
01:26:24,221 --> 01:26:26,556
Look out! Clear! Clear! Look out!

1664
01:26:26,932 --> 01:26:28,058
It is about belief

1665
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:29,101
Faith.

1666
01:26:29,226 --> 01:26:30,227
Trust.

1667
01:26:34,231 --> 01:26:35,607
Without those qualities,

1668
01:26:35,691 --> 01:26:39,111
magic, as an art form,
would no longer exist.

1669
01:26:39,695 --> 01:26:41,530
But what happens if these qualities

1670
01:26:41,738 --> 01:26:43,699
are not used for their higher purpose?

1671
01:26:43,907 --> 01:26:46,702
And instead they're used to cheat, lie.

1672
01:26:46,910 --> 01:26:49,121
For personal gain or for greed.

1673
01:26:49,287 --> 01:26:50,956
Then it's no longer magic.

1674
01:26:51,123 --> 01:26:52,207
It's crime.

1675
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:55,460
So tonight, for our final act,

1676
01:26:55,502 --> 01:26:58,338
you're gonna help us set a few things right.

1677
01:27:02,467 --> 01:27:03,635
What's going on here, Rhodes?

1678
01:27:03,885 --> 01:27:05,053
I don't know.

1679
01:27:06,138 --> 01:27:07,305
Showtime.

1680
01:27:12,477 --> 01:27:13,478
Look!

1681
01:27:17,816 --> 01:27:19,735
There they are on the roof. Let's move!

1682
01:27:19,818 --> 01:27:21,111
Go, go, go!

1683
01:27:21,820 --> 01:27:23,155
- Dylan!
- FBI, coming through!

1684
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:25,782
What are you doing here?

1685
01:27:25,907 --> 01:27:26,992
They're going in the wrong direction

1686
01:27:27,117 --> 01:27:28,160
and you know it.

1687
01:27:28,452 --> 01:27:30,787
Rhodes! I need all personnel now!

1688
01:27:30,912 --> 01:27:34,249
You need to trust me.
Take your leap of faith.

1689
01:27:35,083 --> 01:27:36,168
Wait.

1690
01:27:36,626 --> 01:27:37,753
I'm going to go with her.

1691
01:27:37,961 --> 01:27:39,171
Go. I got your back. I'll be right here.

1692
01:27:56,271 --> 01:28:00,317
Let's go, let's go! Now, now, now!

1693
01:28:11,453 --> 01:28:12,537
Daniel?

1694
01:28:13,205 --> 01:28:14,372
Yeah?

1695
01:28:14,498 --> 01:28:19,127
As our, let's call it,
year of living dangerously

1696
01:28:19,336 --> 01:28:22,672
comes to a close,
in a rare moment of vulnerability,

1697
01:28:22,881 --> 01:28:25,550
I'd like to express a sentiment

1698
01:28:25,634 --> 01:28:27,219
to you about our relationship.

1699
01:28:27,469 --> 01:28:28,512
Okay.

1700
01:28:28,887 --> 01:28:32,390
Well, when I first met you,
I thought you were kind of a

1701
01:28:34,226 --> 01:28:35,227
dick.

1702
01:28:36,728 --> 01:28:37,771
And?

1703
01:28:39,564 --> 01:28:41,233
No, that's it.

1704
01:28:41,483 --> 01:28:42,484
That's very nice.

1705
01:28:42,567 --> 01:28:44,069
- Yeah.
- I'm touched.

1706
01:28:44,236 --> 01:28:45,695
Yeah. Just from the heart.

1707
01:28:45,904 --> 01:28:47,489
Well, I didn't tell you where I was touched.

1708
01:28:47,614 --> 01:28:48,657
Oh, you!

1709
01:28:52,244 --> 01:28:53,912
Oh, God.
What are we gonna do when this is over?

1710
01:28:54,162 --> 01:28:55,247
We're on our own.

1711
01:28:55,330 --> 01:28:56,998
Our instructions run out after the show.

1712
01:28:57,916 --> 01:28:59,793
Even if there is no "Eye,"

1713
01:28:59,876 --> 01:29:01,586
if we were completely played and we spend

1714
01:29:01,711 --> 01:29:03,713
the next 20 years in jail, then,

1715
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:05,924
I just want to say that...

1716
01:29:06,174 --> 01:29:08,552
I know. Me, too.

1717
01:29:09,886 --> 01:29:11,805
Little too sentimental for me.

1718
01:29:18,770 --> 01:29:19,855
There they are!

1719
01:29:22,858 --> 01:29:25,610
Go grab 'em! Put 'em down! Go, go, go!

1720
01:29:25,735 --> 01:29:26,736
Grab 'em!

1721
01:29:31,741 --> 01:29:32,784
Get up!

1722
01:29:33,243 --> 01:29:34,411
What the hell?

1723
01:29:38,206 --> 01:29:39,374
Shit!

1724
01:29:48,592 --> 01:29:49,843
Hello, New York!

1725
01:29:58,310 --> 01:30:00,270
Thank you for the magic.

1726
01:30:00,478 --> 01:30:01,605
And thank you for being such

1727
01:30:01,646 --> 01:30:04,649
an incredible and dedicated audience.

1728
01:30:05,066 --> 01:30:07,110
Unfortunately, like all good things,

1729
01:30:07,152 --> 01:30:08,945
it must come to an end.

1730
01:30:11,656 --> 01:30:14,159
So we would like to start our show tonight...

1731
01:30:14,242 --> 01:30:15,785
By saying goodbye.

1732
01:30:17,162 --> 01:30:18,496
All we wanted was to

1733
01:30:18,580 --> 01:30:20,540
bring the world to a magic show.

1734
01:30:20,624 --> 01:30:22,125
And thereby bring a little magic

1735
01:30:22,167 --> 01:30:23,335
back to the world.

1736
01:30:27,339 --> 01:30:28,506
Clear the way!

1737
01:30:38,266 --> 01:30:41,478
This has been
one hell of a ride for all of us.

1738
01:30:42,020 --> 01:30:44,356
But it's time for us to disappear.

1739
01:30:44,522 --> 01:30:45,857
Good night, New York.

1740
01:30:46,107 --> 01:30:47,525
And thank you for believing in us.

1741
01:30:50,195 --> 01:30:51,321
Stop!

1742
01:30:54,824 --> 01:30:55,825
Freeze!

1743
01:30:56,242 --> 01:30:57,410
No!

1744
01:31:15,512 --> 01:31:16,805
God damn it!

1745
01:31:46,584 --> 01:31:47,752
I'm sorry.

1746
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:51,047
You were right. It's bigger than all of us.

1747
01:31:52,173 --> 01:31:56,261
This is one time I'm not happy being right.

1748
01:31:58,346 --> 01:32:00,098
So I guess this is it.

1749
01:32:02,100 --> 01:32:03,268
Is it?

1750
01:32:29,461 --> 01:32:30,795
Dylan!

1751
01:32:31,129 --> 01:32:33,381
Dylan! Dylan!

1752
01:32:33,715 --> 01:32:34,758
Hey.

1753
01:32:36,092 --> 01:32:38,011
- You see that?
- What?

1754
01:32:41,639 --> 01:32:43,016
Where's the real money?

1755
01:32:57,197 --> 01:33:01,159
You're under arrest! Hands in the air! Now!

1756
01:33:52,335 --> 01:33:53,461
I've been framed.

1757
01:33:54,796 --> 01:33:55,839
I'm sure you were.

1758
01:33:55,922 --> 01:33:57,215
Yeah, but I can prove it.

1759
01:33:57,715 --> 01:33:58,967
I always do.

1760
01:33:59,342 --> 01:34:01,344
Just like I predicted that you'd play the fool.

1761
01:34:01,386 --> 01:34:03,888
Let's just drop the theatricality, all right?

1762
01:34:04,139 --> 01:34:06,307
The cameras aren't rolling in here.

1763
01:34:06,516 --> 01:34:09,060
Fellas, can I have a few minutes
with my friend here alone, please.

1764
01:34:09,102 --> 01:34:10,937
Sure.

1765
01:34:15,900 --> 01:34:16,943
All right.

1766
01:34:17,986 --> 01:34:19,612
I got information to trade.

1767
01:34:19,737 --> 01:34:20,905
I believe that's how it's done. Huh?

1768
01:34:21,114 --> 01:34:22,740
If it's of some value.

1769
01:34:25,201 --> 01:34:28,371
These bars give a man time to think.

1770
01:34:29,581 --> 01:34:32,834
And I'm pretty sure I know how they did it.

1771
01:34:33,293 --> 01:34:35,420
Remember the rabbit trick
in the second show?

1772
01:34:36,588 --> 01:34:38,423
The box was never empty.

1773
01:34:40,758 --> 01:34:41,926
The room wasn't either.

1774
01:34:43,219 --> 01:34:45,597
After gaining access to the warehouse,

1775
01:34:45,930 --> 01:34:48,057
The Horsemen left the real safe

1776
01:34:48,099 --> 01:34:50,518
and transformed the whole room

1777
01:34:50,602 --> 01:34:53,104
into a giant rabbit box.

1778
01:34:54,689 --> 01:34:56,858
You go charging in there,

1779
01:34:57,108 --> 01:34:59,527
thinking the safe was already gone.

1780
01:34:59,777 --> 01:35:00,778
Hey!

1781
01:35:00,820 --> 01:35:02,113
Hey! Stop!

1782
01:35:02,322 --> 01:35:03,781
Missing the trick. Again.

1783
01:35:03,823 --> 01:35:04,866
Which was to make you think

1784
01:35:05,116 --> 01:35:06,659
the safe had already been stolen,

1785
01:35:06,743 --> 01:35:08,953
so you'd drop your guard and leave.

1786
01:35:09,537 --> 01:35:12,498
Now, while you were busy
playing with balloon animals,

1787
01:35:12,707 --> 01:35:15,293
someone was breaking into the warehouse.

1788
01:35:33,811 --> 01:35:34,979
Who?

1789
01:35:36,397 --> 01:35:37,899
Jack Wilder.

1790
01:35:38,650 --> 01:35:39,984
Holy shit.

1791
01:35:40,193 --> 01:35:42,570
No. No way. He died
right in front of my eyes.

1792
01:35:43,363 --> 01:35:45,490
Unless, of course, he didn't.

1793
01:35:52,830 --> 01:35:54,082
It's locked.

1794
01:35:54,874 --> 01:35:56,084
Weren't you listening?

1795
01:35:56,584 --> 01:35:57,669
Nothing's ever locked.

1796
01:35:59,045 --> 01:36:01,839
Well done, Mr. Wilder! Good work.

1797
01:36:02,006 --> 01:36:03,841
You're a big boy now, Jack.

1798
01:36:04,008 --> 01:36:06,386
He escaped in a standard FBI vehicle, right?

1799
01:36:10,181 --> 01:36:11,516
Led you to the bridge.

1800
01:36:11,766 --> 01:36:13,393
Where the other Horsemen were waiting

1801
01:36:13,518 --> 01:36:15,395
with an identical replacement car.

1802
01:36:16,396 --> 01:36:17,397
It only took a split second

1803
01:36:17,522 --> 01:36:18,523
for you to lose contact with it

1804
01:36:18,564 --> 01:36:19,565
and make the switch.

1805
01:36:41,879 --> 01:36:44,882
When you crawled into that burning car,

1806
01:36:45,258 --> 01:36:47,260
quite heroically, I might add,

1807
01:36:49,137 --> 01:36:51,222
you almost died trying to rescue

1808
01:36:51,306 --> 01:36:54,309
what I assume was
a cadaver from the morgue.

1809
01:36:55,810 --> 01:36:59,480
Why go through
such an elaborate and dangerous plan

1810
01:37:00,231 --> 01:37:01,733
just to frame one guy?

1811
01:37:02,066 --> 01:37:03,109
I don't know.

1812
01:37:03,234 --> 01:37:04,652
They never kept any of the money they took.

1813
01:37:04,736 --> 01:37:07,155
Yeah, that's the part
I haven't been able to put together yet.

1814
01:37:07,238 --> 01:37:09,949
But I just gave you information that
is substantially more important.

1815
01:37:10,074 --> 01:37:11,784
- No. Not really.
- What?

1816
01:37:11,868 --> 01:37:16,414
I finally got a chance to
really look into Lionel Shrike.

1817
01:37:16,706 --> 01:37:19,459
His comeback attempt. His accident.

1818
01:37:20,418 --> 01:37:23,921
The insurer who denied the family's claim?

1819
01:37:24,130 --> 01:37:25,340
Tressler Insurance.

1820
01:37:27,258 --> 01:37:29,510
The bank that carried the note?

1821
01:37:30,595 --> 01:37:32,263
Credit Republican of Paris.

1822
01:37:32,472 --> 01:37:34,098
Credit Republicain de Paris.

1823
01:37:35,433 --> 01:37:36,893
What do you make of that?

1824
01:37:36,934 --> 01:37:39,103
A sucker is born every minute.

1825
01:37:39,854 --> 01:37:42,440
What if all this was just leading up to

1826
01:37:42,523 --> 01:37:45,276
us getting mugged
in Central Park at 2:00 a.m.?

1827
01:37:45,318 --> 01:37:48,071
No, I'm telling you,
we're right where we need to be.

1828
01:37:48,112 --> 01:37:49,238
We just have to find...

1829
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:50,406
That?

1830
01:37:52,950 --> 01:37:54,660
The Lionel Shrike tree.

1831
01:37:55,620 --> 01:37:58,122
And the card encased in glass.

1832
01:37:59,457 --> 01:38:01,084
What do we do now?

1833
01:38:17,725 --> 01:38:19,185
Oh, nice!

1834
01:38:35,034 --> 01:38:36,494
So, here's my new theory.

1835
01:38:36,994 --> 01:38:40,415
The legend is that the "Eye" is everywhere.

1836
01:38:41,082 --> 01:38:42,250
Waiting

1837
01:38:42,667 --> 01:38:46,421
for the truly great magicians
to distinguish themselves

1838
01:38:47,380 --> 01:38:49,173
from the mediocre ones.

1839
01:38:50,007 --> 01:38:51,217
Maybe that was you.

1840
01:38:51,843 --> 01:38:54,095
Deep down inside
you wanted nothing more

1841
01:38:54,178 --> 01:38:56,848
than to be part of the "Eye,"
but you were never invited.

1842
01:38:56,889 --> 01:39:00,059
So you try to destroy them.
But instead what happens?

1843
01:39:00,518 --> 01:39:02,019
You pissed them off.

1844
01:39:03,729 --> 01:39:06,774
The Eye isn't real.

1845
01:39:06,858 --> 01:39:09,944
Okay, then, explain then.
Who's behind all this?

1846
01:39:10,194 --> 01:39:11,529
Somebody with an obsession.

1847
01:39:11,779 --> 01:39:13,197
- Meticulous.
- Who?

1848
01:39:13,281 --> 01:39:16,617
Somebody prepared to sacrifice everything.

1849
01:39:16,701 --> 01:39:19,287
Somebody so prepared to lose

1850
01:39:19,370 --> 01:39:21,873
that they wouldn't even be a suspect
until the trick was done.

1851
01:39:21,956 --> 01:39:24,792
I don't want a profile.
I need a name. Who? Who?

1852
01:39:24,876 --> 01:39:26,544
I don't know who.

1853
01:39:26,919 --> 01:39:29,130
But they had to have
access to the warehouse

1854
01:39:29,213 --> 01:39:30,548
to plant the mirrors.

1855
01:39:31,883 --> 01:39:35,720
Always a step ahead of me. And the FBI.

1856
01:39:35,803 --> 01:39:39,056
Got past them not once,
not twice, but consistently.

1857
01:39:39,390 --> 01:39:42,018
Almost as if they were on the...

1858
01:39:54,906 --> 01:39:56,282
The inside.

1859
01:40:08,419 --> 01:40:09,462
You.

1860
01:40:14,091 --> 01:40:15,092
Why?

1861
01:40:15,927 --> 01:40:18,262
That is the question, isn't it?

1862
01:40:19,096 --> 01:40:20,640
You're right.

1863
01:40:21,265 --> 01:40:23,601
I can't tell you how long I've waited

1864
01:40:23,684 --> 01:40:25,645
to see the look on your face.

1865
01:40:28,105 --> 01:40:29,607
Who are you?

1866
01:40:30,691 --> 01:40:32,109
What do you want from me?

1867
01:40:32,944 --> 01:40:34,445
What do I want?

1868
01:40:34,862 --> 01:40:37,782
I want you to spend
the rest of your life in this cell,

1869
01:40:37,865 --> 01:40:41,869
staring at four walls
and wondering how you missed it.

1870
01:40:42,537 --> 01:40:45,623
How you let yourself
be so blinded by your ego

1871
01:40:46,207 --> 01:40:48,626
that you convinced yourself
that you were one step ahead

1872
01:40:48,709 --> 01:40:51,462
when you were always two steps behind.

1873
01:40:56,133 --> 01:40:57,343
Dylan?

1874
01:40:58,302 --> 01:40:59,303
Wait a minute.

1875
01:41:00,346 --> 01:41:02,473
Dylan! How did this happen?

1876
01:41:10,147 --> 01:41:11,816
Dylan!

1877
01:41:11,941 --> 01:41:12,942
Why?

1878
01:41:13,651 --> 01:41:14,652
Why?

1879
01:41:18,656 --> 01:41:20,825
Oh, my God.

1880
01:41:21,826 --> 01:41:23,703
I did not see that coming.

1881
01:41:23,828 --> 01:41:25,079
That's impossible!

1882
01:41:25,162 --> 01:41:26,163
No way.

1883
01:41:26,247 --> 01:41:28,666
That was actually pretty good.

1884
01:41:29,083 --> 01:41:30,167
Thank you.

1885
01:41:30,585 --> 01:41:32,837
When I said,
"Always be the smartest guy in the room."

1886
01:41:32,878 --> 01:41:33,921
We were in agreement.

1887
01:41:34,171 --> 01:41:35,339
Okay. Right.

1888
01:41:35,715 --> 01:41:36,716
Henley.

1889
01:41:37,508 --> 01:41:39,343
I've never seen her speechless.

1890
01:41:39,427 --> 01:41:41,012
I take that as a huge compliment.

1891
01:41:41,721 --> 01:41:44,390
Hey, man,
I'm so sorry for kicking your ass. Really.

1892
01:41:45,182 --> 01:41:46,684
Hey, listen, for the record,

1893
01:41:46,851 --> 01:41:50,354
I have always been a 100% believer.

1894
01:41:50,521 --> 01:41:52,773
And the amount of energy
I have expended to keep

1895
01:41:52,857 --> 01:41:55,026
these infidels on point...

1896
01:41:55,067 --> 01:41:57,111
Merritt, you're in.

1897
01:41:57,945 --> 01:41:59,030
God bless.

1898
01:41:59,113 --> 01:42:00,156
Come.

1899
01:42:01,198 --> 01:42:04,368
The real magic is taking
four strong solo acts

1900
01:42:04,577 --> 01:42:06,454
and making them all work together.

1901
01:42:06,704 --> 01:42:08,998
And that's exactly what you did.

1902
01:42:09,957 --> 01:42:11,042
So welcome.

1903
01:42:14,378 --> 01:42:16,422
Welcome to the Eye.

1904
01:43:23,614 --> 01:43:25,700
It was all connected.

1905
01:43:26,325 --> 01:43:29,328
Credit Republican. Tressler Insurance.

1906
01:43:38,713 --> 01:43:40,005
And Elkhorn?

1907
01:43:40,131 --> 01:43:42,049
What's the connection to Shrike?

1908
01:43:44,552 --> 01:43:47,763
Elkhorn started as a safe manufacturer.

1909
01:43:48,097 --> 01:43:50,224
They used cheap steel.

1910
01:43:51,809 --> 01:43:53,102
They cut corners.

1911
01:43:53,185 --> 01:43:56,439
When he got
to the bottom of the river, the safe warped.

1912
01:43:56,480 --> 01:43:57,857
And he was trapped.

1913
01:43:59,400 --> 01:44:01,110
He was your father.

1914
01:44:03,028 --> 01:44:04,363
Of course.

1915
01:44:04,780 --> 01:44:06,699
I was 12 years old.

1916
01:44:06,782 --> 01:44:08,159
And from that moment on,

1917
01:44:08,492 --> 01:44:11,078
I created a persona.

1918
01:44:11,704 --> 01:44:13,622
I planned. I worked out every detail.

1919
01:44:13,664 --> 01:44:17,001
But the one thing
that I couldn't imagine happening

1920
01:44:17,418 --> 01:44:18,586
was you.

1921
01:44:20,129 --> 01:44:23,090
I know that the logical conclusion for you

1922
01:44:23,716 --> 01:44:26,302
is to take this case to its resolution.

1923
01:44:26,510 --> 01:44:29,597
And for you to turn me in.

1924
01:44:34,685 --> 01:44:35,770
Yeah.

1925
01:44:37,730 --> 01:44:41,567
But you know how I feel
about resolution and logic.

1926
01:44:42,943 --> 01:44:44,278
And you also know

1927
01:44:45,029 --> 01:44:49,366
that I think some things
are best left unexplained.

1928
01:44:55,998 --> 01:44:57,792
One more secret to lock away.

1929
01:45:25,236 --> 01:45:26,737
Come in close.

1930
01:45:27,238 --> 01:45:28,489
Closer.

1931
01:45:28,572 --> 01:45:30,825
Because now you know our secret.

1932
01:45:30,908 --> 01:45:33,244
We could be anywhere. Watching you.

1933
01:45:33,869 --> 01:45:37,540
We're looking for someone
to help us with our next trick.

1934
01:45:37,581 --> 01:45:40,125
On the count of three, open your eyes

1935
01:45:40,209 --> 01:45:42,169
and tell me what you see.

1936
01:45:43,170 --> 01:45:44,255
One.

1937
01:45:44,380 --> 01:45:45,381
Two...
