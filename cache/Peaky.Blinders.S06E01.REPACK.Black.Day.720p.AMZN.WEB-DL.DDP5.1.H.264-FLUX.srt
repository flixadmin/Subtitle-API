1
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,239
The man we're about
to meet is the devil.

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,999
My name's Mosley. Oswald Mosley.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,279
You've come to my attention.

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,919
Michael Gray.

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,599
You lost all your cousin's money in
America, playing the fool.

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,879
And poor old Arthur Shelby.

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,080
His wife, she's been seen
with another man.

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,239
May you Peaky Blinders all rot.

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,280
GUNSHOT

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,479
If you're going to England,
I'm coming with you.

11
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,559
I want to meet your family.

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,640
No, you don't.

13
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:37,759
Mr Thomas, it is the purest opium
that has ever arrived in Europe.

14
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,679
Â£250,000.

15
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,119
All we have to do is keep it here
for a week.

16
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,479
I vote against it, Tom.

17
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,079
Those in favour?

18
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,240
Motion carried.

19
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:53,399
We're talking about an empty chair,
Ada. My chair. My throne.

20
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,719
Someone wants my crown.

21
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,039
I think it might be Michael.

22
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,399
Mr Shelby, my name is Captain Swing.

23
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,959
Michael, your kin, was making deals

24
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,279
with the very men who want you
dead.

25
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,800
I'm doing this for you, Tommy.

26
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,200
It's time.

27
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,360
And you know it.

28
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,680
Let me guess...

29
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,519
..don't fuck with the
Peaky Blinders.

30
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,999
There will be a war
and one of you will die,

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,879
but which one I cannot tell.

32
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,719
I'll do what I have to do, Pol.

33
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,079
Kill... and kill.

34
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,319
I have a job for you.

35
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,120
I'm going to shoot Oswald Mosley.

36
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,760
Kill the man, kill the message.

37
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,079
I think it's about time we
got off the stage, old man.

38
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,599
The Chinese, the Italians.

39
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,999
Mosley knew nothing!

40
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,959
He knew nothing!

41
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,400
Who?!

42
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,680
Talk to me.

43
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,399
Maybe I've found him...

44
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,200
..Arthur, the man I can't defeat.

45
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,959
Mosley. I don't know.

46
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,680
I don't fucking know.

47
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,240
Doesn't make sense.

48
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,079
Let's...

49
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,440
Let's go inside.

50
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,759
We'll work it out, have a drink.

51
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,960
I need to walk.

52
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,599
The work's all done, Tommy.

53
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,279
It's all done.

54
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,520
We can walk away from all of this.

55
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,319
It's so easy. It's so soft.

56
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,040
Such a small change.

57
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,520
HE SCREAMS

58
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,000
GUN CLICKS

59
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,520
Arthur took the bullets out.

60
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,040
On the way back.

61
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,960
He said you stopped at
a crossroads to throw up.

62
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,040
You're not even a soldier any more,
Tommy.

63
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,840
You didn't check your weapon.

64
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,719
You're not a soldier,
you're a coward.

65
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,200
I heard you pull the trigger.

66
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,120
Leaving your family behind
without a goodbye...

67
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,040
If you still need a way out...

68
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,400
..here are six of them.

69
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,160
Mother.

70
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,800
They let you pass through.

71
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,280
They wouldn't let me pass.

72
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,520
As if there were to be
another consequence.

PHONE RINGS

75
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,479
Hello?

76
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,399
Mr Shelby, I imagine you're curious
as to who it was prevented

77
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,119
the assassination last night.

78
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:14,199
If you look out your window,
you'll see a flag of truce.

79
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:18,719
It's a unit of volunteers bringing
the bodies of your dead to you

80
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,720
to send to heaven in your own way.

81
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,839
Last night's operation was carried
out by soldiers from three

82
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,200
Dublin brigades of the
Irish Republican Army.

83
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,520
We need to keep Mr Mosley alive.

84
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,640
That's all you need to know.

85
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,359
Also, you should know that saving

86
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,200
Mosley's life wasn't our only
intervention last night.

87
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:55,240
We've made some changes to the
structure of your organisation.

88
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,400
Ever since you began
to build your empire...

89
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,800
..you've had a crutch to lean on.

90
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,559
Last night, we kicked
away that crutch.

91
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,080
From now on, it will be us
that you lean on.

92
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,960
Please be aware, Mr Shelby,
that the deaths of your people...

93
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,760
..are your own responsibility...

94
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,360
..because you consistently fail to
understand your own limitations.

Mum...

97
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,039
..it was the ambitions
and strategies

98
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,440
of one man that caused this.

99
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,480
And I swear in the name
of Almighty God...

100
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,399
..no matter what it takes...

101
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,400
..no matter how many lies I have
to tell...

102
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,680
..I will take revenge on
Tommy Shelby.

103
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,680
Monsieur.

104
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,440

You want a drink?

I'll have a glass of water, please.

109
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:32,240
Windows got broke because a lot of
people here are drunk and angry.

110
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,520
You know?

111
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,919
Half the men on this island
made their living

112
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,079
bootlegging till today.

113
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,040
The other half fixed their boats.

114
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,960
Maybe you should take your water
into the hall.

TOMMY SIGHS

116
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,360
I learned a lot of things in France.

117
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,920
Island is crawling with
you fucking commissary men.

118
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,360
Closing our warehouses down.

119
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,520
Throwing men out of work.

120
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:13,760
Ten years our boat ran whisky down
the President Roads to Boston.

121
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,280
Now we have fucking nothing.

122
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,559
And you sit in front of us
and order fucking water.

123
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,879
Is that meant to be a joke?

124
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,920
No.

125
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:34,920
I ordered water because I no
longer drink alcohol of any kind.

126
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:45,279
You, my friend, are
going to drink a toast.

127
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,039
You will raise your glass to
the poor people of Miquelon,

128
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:52,399
whose lives you bastards
have destroyed.

129
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,039
Drink it.

130
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,440
Hey.

131
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,320
Drink.

132
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,519
You're not leaving this bar
until you have raised

133
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,240
a toast to the people of Miquelon.

134
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,360
OK.

135
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,480
OK.

136
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:23,040
I understand that, today of
all days, you would be angry.

137
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,279
But if you had read my card
instead of burning it,

138
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:32,759
you would realise that this
is a misunderstanding.

139
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:36,439
Now, I've been very patient,
given the circumstances,

140
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:40,159
but you need to sit down

Before this goes any further,
please let me explain.

144
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,799
I will not drink your toast

145
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,959
cos four years ago,
I forswore alcohol.

146
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,000

Since I foreswore alcohol,

151
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,600
I've become a calmer

152
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,399
Get in.

..I can resort to my old ways.

If this were to happen now,

157
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,480
it would indeed be a black day in
Miquelon.

158
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,079
Now, my guests will be
arriving shortly.

159
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,599
I need to prepare the room.

WATCH TICKS

167
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,880
HE SIGHS

168
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,240
DOOR OPENS

169
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,239
There will be a war
and one of you will die.

170
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,160
But which one I cannot tell.

171
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,040
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

172
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,720
Hello, Tommy.

173
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,719
There's a man out there having
his face stitched back up.

174
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,599
That was a misunderstanding.

175
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,760
Hello, Michael.

176
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,799
I wasn't sure what I'd think
when I saw you again, Tom.

177
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,559
Oh, yeah?

178
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,680
What do you think?

179
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,759
Since my mother passed
away four years ago,

180
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,559
Tommy and I haven't even spoken.

181
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,239
Well, we've both been very busy.

182
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,199
You've been too busy to punish
the people who killed her.

183
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:12,039
You know, Michael, when you're
dealing with a very powerful enemy,

184
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,240
taking revenge sometimes
requires time.

185
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,480
You have to... pick your moment.

186
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,320
That moment will come.

187
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,479
But now we have a business
interest in common

188
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:35,640
and any bad blood will be diluted by
time and a practical self-interest.

189
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,319
Well, Tommy, we're all keen to
hear what you have to say.

190
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,719
I'm very much looking forward
to working with you again, Michael.

191
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,799
You look very well.

192
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,879
You too.

193
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,799
How is the family?

194
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,119
Yeee-haaa!

195
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,560
CHILDREN LAUGH AND SHOUT

196
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:07,039
This projector is a gift
from Charlie fucking Chaplin

197
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,919
and he sent it all
the way from Hollywood.

198
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,719
Now sit down and watch the film.

199
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,559
Oh, God. No, Elizabeth, Elizabeth,

200
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,919
don't do that, you're going to hurt
yourself.

201
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,039
Yes, hi. Is that the Bell Tavern?

202
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:20,079
If there's a gypsy in there called
Johnny Dogs, can you tell him

203
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,599
to come and round up his
fucking kids?

204
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,840
It's Christmas. A time for family.

205
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,440
Mum, I was watching that.

206
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:37,320
OK, everyone, OK.

207
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,839
We're having this
Christmas party early

208
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:46,239
because tomorrow, me and Charles
and Ruby are going on a big ship

209
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,359
to Canada, to be with their daddy.

210
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,920
But we told Father Christmas
about the party...

211
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,799
..and he has brought you
all presents.

212
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,280
CHILDREN EXCLAIM
Oh! Yes!

213
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,239
Race ya! Ada, where the fuck
is Father Christmas?

214
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,839
I don't know.
He was supposed to be here by now.

215
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,560
Yeah. Where the fuck are you, Santa?

216
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,079
MIMICS GUNFIRE

217
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,479
Ohhh! Ohhh!

218
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,119
Ugggh!

219
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,479
No!

220
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,519
Ugggh!

221
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,560
You've got me!

222
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,560
I've got a gun. You'd better run!

223
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,440
You'd better run!

224
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,839
Gentlemen, today is the
last day of prohibition.

225
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,479
But rather than see it as the
end of something, I believe that,

226
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,679
for men like us, it can present...
a new beginning.

227
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,679
A new opportunity.

228
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:44,000
An opportunity I would like to share
with people I know I can trust.

229
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,959
For the last 12 years,
the men of this island have been

230
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,959
making their living from bootlegging
whisky,

231
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,319
from navigating the waters

232
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,799
and avoiding American
border patrols.

233
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,839
But now that whisky is
about to become legal,

234
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:03,039
the trade will fall back into the
hands of capitalists from New York,

235
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,079
Boston and Toronto.

236
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,120
But...

237
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,240
..when one door closes...

238
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,479
..another one opens.

239
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:17,279
We can take advantage of the systems
that are in place on Miquelon Island

240
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:20,559
and offer selected boat crews the
opportunity to carry on working.

241
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:23,360
But this time with
a different cargo.

242
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,399
You want me to pour?

243
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,480
No.

244
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,759
Now it's all over
the fucking island.

245
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,239
This is an island with
no morals and no opinions -

246
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,679
just a load of fucking boats

247
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:58,039
with nothing to carry
and nowhere to go.

248
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,759
The reason why Miquelon was used
to run whisky in the first place

249
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,159
is cos it sits outside
the territorial waters

250
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:06,039
of both America and Canada.

251
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,639
Technically, it's French territory.

252
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,400
The FBI, the RCMP
have no jurisdiction.

253
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,479
Where do you get this stuff?

254
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,199
I have established a supply
chain over the last four years

255
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,959
with associates in Belfast.

256
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:25,319
We decided it was time to
break into the American market.

257
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:29,360
That, my friend, is the
finest opium in the world.

258
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:33,960
Delivered to my warehouse in
Liverpool directly from Shanghai.

259
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:39,919
Michael, when it comes to this shit,
you're the expert.

260
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,719
I trust him.

261
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,559
What about the French police?

262
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:47,959
I have been in communication with
the Miquelon Prefet des Gendarmes.

263
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:51,039
We fought in two of the
same battles in France.

264
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,959
We consider each other comrades.

265
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,879
I have offered my comrade
12 million francs

266
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,599
if the boats between Miquelon
and Boston keep running.

267
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:06,039
We will have to take your proposal
to Uncle Jack in Boston.

268
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,999
Perhaps we can meet after you've
spoken with Uncle Jack, Michael,

269
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,999
who I believe is your wife's uncle,
Jack Nelson.

270
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,559
Hey! Ha-ha!

271
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,919
The guy knows things
that can get him killed

272
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,560
and he says them out loud.

273
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,560
I have a high regard for Mr Nelson.

274
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,639
He has a history not unlike my own.

275
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,559
Jack Nelson's past is forgotten.

276
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:30,399
Not forgotten. Fucking gone.

277
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,480
No, not gone, just erased from
the records, like my own.

278
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,000
Give him my regards, will ya?

279
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,600
You haven't touched your drink, Tom.

280
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,760
You know, since we last met,
Michael...

281
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,800
..well, I've become a better man.

282
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,839
I now realise that whisky is just
fuel for the loud engines

283
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,079
inside your head.

284
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,359
LAUGHTER

285
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,640
Catch yourself on!

286
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,519
What is this guy, a fuckin' poet?
Eh?

287
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,640
Oh, I do read poetry,
but I don't yet write it.

288
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,639
They say the fog is going to get
worse.

289
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,440
We'd better get off this island
before it traps us here.

290
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,079
Just understand.

291
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:32,439
Uncle Jack decides everything, OK?

292
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:35,959
And I decide when a meeting is over.

293
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,840
So sit down till I say.

294
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,920
TOMMY CLEARS HIS THROAT

295
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,680
Maith fear.

296
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,880
Put some fuckin' hair on your chest,
huh?

297
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,439
Good boy.

298
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,480
LAUGHTER

299
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,960
Now, give us all a poem
before we go.

300
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,920
Want to hear a poem?

301
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,480
Want to hear a poem?

302
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:37,280
What about you, Brainbox?

303
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,719
I was angry with my friend

304
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:56,920
I told my wrath, my wrath did end

305
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,280
I was angry with my foe

306
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,720
I told it not...

307
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,680
..my wrath did grow.

308
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,759
It's from The Poison Tree
by William Blake.

309
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,160
You won't have heard of him.

310
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,960
Meeting over.

311
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,359
Oh, and by the way,

312
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:33,839
my friend, the Police Commissioner,
told me that he'd spoken

313
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,479
to his FBI liaison officer,

314
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:41,959
and he told him that there is
an informant in your organisation

315
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,559
in South Boston.

316
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:47,240
I tell you this in the
spirit of corporate hygiene.

317
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,880
Here you are, Michael.

318
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,799
Beware the man with
a bleeding heart tattoo

319
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,920
with "Maria" written in red.

320
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,960
Have a good day, gentlemen.

321
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,680
This time, don't burn it.

322
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,720
Arthur...

323
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,399
Come on, come on.

324
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,440
Tch, God.

325
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,319
Oh, God, if Polly was still here,

326
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,319
she'd never have let it get
this bad.

327
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:18,039
Come on. Come on, Arthur.

328
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,919
Arthur!

329
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:23,399
I am not Polly,
but I am still your fucking sister.

330
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,000
You swore to me you
would stop using.

331
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,239
It's Christmas Day, Ada.
Christmas Day.

332
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,959
Yes, it's Christmas.

333
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:35,079
So where the fuck are
the fucking presents?

334
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,639
I'll be all right in a bit...

335
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:37,800
HE MUMBLES

336
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,959
Great.

337
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,919
My brother off his face on junk.

338
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,360
Every day there's a question
without an answer.

339
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,680
A leak without a bucket.

340
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,120
Me without a clue what to do.

341
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,480
Fuck.

342
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,440
I love you, Ada.

343
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,919
Children! Father Christmas has been!

344
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,399
Father Christmas!

345
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,680
CHILDREN LAUGH

346
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,200
What did you ask for?

347
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,239
What have we got?
LIZZIE SIGHS

348
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:21,399
Father Christmas got stuck up
the chimney again, did he? Mmm.

349
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,319
What ship are you on tomorrow?

350
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,519
LIZZIE SIGHS

351
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:27,280
Oh, the best,
the most expensive one.

352
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,199
And then we'll get there
and Tommy will say,

353
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:36,079
"Hello, Lizzie. Hello, children,"
in that dead voice.

354
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,919
Come on, Lizzie,
he'll be on holiday.

355
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,600
Being away might change him.

356
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,759
Even on holiday, Ada...

357
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,359
..even on top of a rocky mountain,

358
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,920
he'll be the same way
he's been since Polly died.

359
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:55,040
No more Polly, no more whisky,
no more Tommy.

360
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,639
Yeah, I'm calling
from Miquelon Island,

361
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,959
from the police station.

362
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:32,079
There is a boat leaving the island
now, heading across the border.

363
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,519
When it docks at St John's,

364
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:38,559
a man named Michael Gray will board
a ferry to Boston.

365
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,759
Listen very carefully.

366
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,559
He's wearing a dark coat,
a blue suit,

367
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,039
and carrying a black briefcase.

368
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:50,360
Inside the briefcase is five pound
of pure, refined opium.

369
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,959
Concerned citizen.

370
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,920
Yeah, my name is Mr Jones.

371
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,560
Yes, I do.

372
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,480
But I don't drink any more.

No, I don't work for him any more.

Mmm-hmm.

389
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,320
Fuck.

Do you know who this man is?

SHE SIGHS

00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,440
All right, come on, Arthur.

393

HE MUTTERS

394
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,920
HE CHUCKLES

00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,080
Hey, that tickles.

396
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:29,159
His brother, Thomas Shelby, says
don't serve him opium ever again

397
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:32,359
or someone will write Arthur
Shelby's name on your chest

I can't talk about anything in here.

402
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,679
I just wanted to see your face
and smell your perfume.

403
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,199
Tommy Shelby steps back into
your life and, right away,

404
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,439
this is what happens.

405
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,039
No names in here.

406
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:41,359
Sorry. Let's just call him
the devil.

407
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,520

408
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,879
How is Laurence?

409
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,839
Oh, you know. Missing his father.

410
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,719
What the fuck happened, Michael?

411
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,879
It's in hand.

412
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,079
Whose hand?

413
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:01,440
No, really. Whose fucking hand,
Michael? Hmm?

414
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,959
Like everything else in this city,

415
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,559
it's in the hand of your Uncle Jack.

416
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:16,239
I need him to get the charges
lifted and get me out of here.

417
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,959
I already talked to him.

418
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:21,639
He told me what
the devil proposed.

419
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:25,039
Tommy Shelby wants to do
business with Jack Nelson?

420
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,119
He wants to take on Boston?

421
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,279
No-one is taking on anyone.

422
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,439
It's in hand.

423
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,279
There are deals being made at
a high level,

424
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,039
but there are some people at
the middle level

425
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,759
and lower levels who cannot be
trusted.

426
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,159
Michael, this sounds fucking...

427
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,520
Shut up and listen.

428
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,519
It was Tommy himself who warned us
of the informant.

429
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,079
We're guessing that the informant

430
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,440
was the one that tipped off the
police about me.

431
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,479
Then the devil's plan
has already begun.

432
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,799
What's the point of ships and
planes if you can't get away?

433
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:59,759
Gina, in today's paper, you will
read about a man being fished out of

434
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,919
the Boston Harbour with
a bleeding heart tattoo

435
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,119
and the name "Maria"
written on his arm.

436
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,519
Single shot to the head.

437
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,680
Yeah, I know, I read it already.

438
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:12,239
His death will lead to others.

439
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:16,599
For this business to work,
we must only use men we trust.

440
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,359
And while the clean-up is being
carried out,

441
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,799
you must keep things to yourself.

442
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:24,559
You talk loose to anyone,
it'll be me in the harbour

443
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,599
and you'll be the Maria
with the bleeding heart.

444
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,680
Do you understand?

445
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,040
Michael, I just want the truth.

446
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,719
No, fuck that - I need the truth!

447
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,239
Why are you doing business
with him again?

448
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:45,679
Gina, tell me what you're thinking
of getting Laurence for Christmas.

449
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,919
There are plenty of men who can
supply powder all over the world.

450
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:51,000
I don't understand why it needs
to be him.

451
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,120
HE SIGHS

452
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:02,440
Some of my business with
Tommy Shelby is unfinished.

453
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,120
This is my opportunity
to finish it.

454
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:12,799
So speak to your uncle and
get me the fuck out of here.

Have a fucking drink.

473
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,799

Irish whisky distilleries.

now to make those deals.

Yeah. He's a very powerful,
very impressive man.

478
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:58,439
I've only seen photographs -
when he was young, police mug shots,

479
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:01,959
and, more recently,
in high-society magazines.

me to tell him,

this close to Tommy Shelby,

it's, "Oh, the horror.

"to fall on your knees,
open your mouth and say,

490
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:38,520
"'Yes, sir. Please, sir.'"

491
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:46,319
So it's Uncle Jack you fall on your
knees for, eh?

492
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:47,680
Not Michael.

493
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,040
He says no deal, Mr Shelby.

494
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,999
You smell of jail, Gina.

495
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,399
And you drink too much.

496
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,440
SHE SCOFFS

497
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:04,119
Yes, but booze is legal.

498
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:05,760
Your white powder's not.

499
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:08,799
Jack has friends in
the government now.

500
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,200
Do you have any idea
how far he's risen?

501
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,760
All the way to the fucking top.

502
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:20,519
Can't have white powder on his shiny
black boots when he's on his way

503
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,999
to meet the President of
the United States cos,

504
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,920
yeah, that's where he goes now.

505
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:31,600
So he can't really be taking such
a big risk on such a little deal.

506
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,880
Go home, boy.

507
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:39,960
Bye-bye, Mr Shelby.

508
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:43,719
Yeah, you have another whisky, Gina.

509
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:46,039
Another dime for Uncle Jack.

510
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:48,399
You mind if I smoke?

511
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,200
If it's legal, it's OK.

512
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:55,880
Before I go, you should know...

513
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:02,759
..that it was me who tipped off
the border police

514
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,960
about the contents of
Michael's suitcase.

515
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,960
I'm the reason he's in jail.

516
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,560
I wanted to give your uncle
a dilemma.

517
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:24,680
His favourite niece's husband banged
up in Boston for smuggling opium.

518
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:28,520
What does he do?

519
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,559
If he intervenes
and has him released,

520
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,239
how will that play
in the Oval Office?

521
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:37,119
If he does nothing, how does
that play in South Boston?

522
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,440
Oh, fuck you.

523
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,399
Fine.

524
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,640
Stay here.

525
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:47,919
Deal here.

526
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,399
Die here, for all I fucking care.

My message to your uncle is this.

531
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:09,720
If he doesn't want to buy my opium,
I will sell to the East Boston Jews.

532
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,440
Oh, baby.

533
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:21,879
Do you want to start a fucking war?

534
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:24,199
With that amount of opium,

535
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:27,719
the balance of power
between the Irish,

536
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:31,199
the Jewish and the Italians

537
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,520
would shift heavily in
favour of the East.

538
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:39,879
I have excellent contacts with
the family that runs East Boston.

539
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:41,799
The Solomons family.

540
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,440
Maybe you've heard of 'em?

541
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:50,200
Once you people have accepted that
you must treat us as equals...

542
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:56,760
..then I think our families
will work together very well.

543
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:00,960
Have a good day, Gina.

Hello, Lizzie.

549
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:40,160
Tommy...

550
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,480
..it's Ruby. She's not well.

551
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:47,920
She's got a temperature of 101.
Doctor's just left.

00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:50,319
What did he say?

553
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:51,879
He says he thinks it's flu,

554
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:54,480
but he's going to come
later to check on her.

555
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,040
She's been coughing and...

00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:01,679
SHE SIGHS

557
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:05,480
Tommy, he said it's not a
good idea for us to travel.

558
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:09,320
We can't board that ship
to Boston today.

559
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:13,359
That's all right, Lizzie,
don't worry.

560
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:17,119
Don't worry, you just stay there for
now and get her better and, er...

561
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:19,559
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT
Can I speak to her?

562
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:21,479
She's sleeping.

563
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:23,879
Yeah, well, let her sleep.

564
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,120
Let her sleep.

565
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:30,399
Lizzie, I've got a bit more
business to do here.

566
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:34,439
Look, you just book a new passage
when Ruby's feeling better.

567
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:36,479
It doesn't matter if you don't
get here for Christmas,

568
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:37,919
just as long as you get here, right?

569
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:41,639
And then I'll get this
business done,

570
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:45,160
you get here with the children,
and then no more.

571
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:51,439
And it'll just be us and the
clean air out in the west.

572
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,319
I've found a place in the mountains.

573
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:55,239
There'll be snow.

574
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:57,879
Tell Ruby, tell Ruby
I'll build her a snowman.

575
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:59,159
Hmm.

576
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:00,959
HE SIGHS

577
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,119
How long has she been coughing?

578
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:04,959
A few days.

579
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,999
She's been out running wild
with Johnny Dog's kids,

580
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,600
out in the cold by the river.

581
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:11,160
SHE SIGHS

582
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,680
Are you OK, Tommy?

583
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,239
Your voice, it sounds different.

584
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,439
It's just cold.

585
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:23,439
I'll get this business done in
Boston...

586
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:24,960
..and that'll be the end of it.

587
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:28,240
And then I just want to...

588
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:33,400
..I just want to pick Ruby up
and hold her in my arms, y'know?

589
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:36,879
I miss the weight of carrying her.

590
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,759
I gave her her presents early.

591
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,200
She loves them.

592
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,159
But last night, she was burning up.

593
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:46,919
She was delirious.

594
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:48,639
She kept talking.

595
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:51,320
Johnny's kids have been
teaching her to speak Gypsy.

596
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:54,920
Teaching her to rob and steal,
more like.

597
00:51:58,560 --> 00:51:59,679
When she was delirious,

598
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:02,400
she kept saying these Gypsy words,
er...

599
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:09,880
.."Tickner maura, tickner maura, o
beng, o beng," over and over again.

600
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:13,280
What? Lizzie, what...?

601
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:16,959
What did you say? What did Ruby say?

602
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,799
"Tickner, tickner maura."

603
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,839
Something like that.
Did she say any...

604
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:23,640
..did she say any other words
that you didn't understand?

605
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:27,559
"O beng, o beng." I don't know.

606
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:29,839
No, Lizzie did she say any
other words in Romany?

607
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:30,919
Fucking listen to me!

608
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:33,079
I don't know Romany words, Tommy.

609
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:34,119
I don't think so.

610
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:36,359
Just "tickner maura" and "o beng"?

611
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:37,399
Yes.

612
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:40,359
Could she see anything when she was
burning up? What could she see?

613
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:43,119
Oh, fuck. Lizzie, please,
just answer the fucking question!

614
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:45,879
She said she could see a man.

615
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:48,879
A man with green eyes.

616
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:51,799
She was delirious.
She was burning up.

617
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,159
What the fuck is the matter?

618
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:54,999
Right, listen, Lizzie,
I'm coming home.

619
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,759
Tommy, it's just a fever, love.

620
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:58,919
Listen to me, I'm coming home.
I'll be on the next steamer back.

621
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,319
You keep her out of school.
You hear me?

622
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,279
You keep her out of school,
you keep her away from...

623
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:03,919
Tommy... keep her away from the
river.

624
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,039
Don't let her ride a horse
or go near a horse.

625
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:09,799
Tell Johnny Dogs and his wives the
words that Ruby has been saying.

626
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:10,839
Do you hear me?

627
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:14,159
Tell Johnny's eldest wife to put
a Black Madonna around her neck.

628
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:17,159
You listen to Esmeralda the same way
you listen to a fucking doctor.

629
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:18,199
You hear me?

630
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:19,559
Fucking Gypsy stuff.

631
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:23,519
Yes, it is Gypsy fucking stuff,
Lizzie! Yes, it fucking is!

632
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:24,839
And you get Curly there.

633
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:27,399
Tell him to stay in the stable
with Ruby's horses,

634
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:30,759
and you do everything that Johnny
Dogs and his wives fucking tell you,

635
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:31,880
do you understand me?

636
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:35,319
I'm sorry, Lizzie.
Do you understand?

637
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:38,719
OK. I'll do it.

638
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,720
All right, I'm coming home.

639
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:51,920
Polly?

640
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:55,160
Polly?

641
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:00,480
They know I'm trying to get out.

642
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:02,960
Pol...

643
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:05,800
..they're coming for me.

644
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,119
You son of a fucking bitch.

645
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,680
You sound American, Michael.

646
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:52,079
I have to go back to England early.

647

Let's make this quick, eh?

00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:55,999
You just fuck people up and you
run away.

649
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,519
No, this business will continue.

650
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,879
Jack Nelson is also
travelling to England.

651
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:02,759
To London and to Edinburgh,
to buy import licenses.

652
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:05,319
How the fuck do you know
where Jack Nelson's going?

653
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:07,599
Well, I have copies
of his itinerary.

654
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:09,119
Of his personal correspondence.

655
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:11,119
Letters from the President of
the United States

656
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:12,919
and his many mistresses.

657
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:15,279
I have contacts in his organisation.

658
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:18,480
An Irishman with a mortgage is
a powerful resource, Michael.

659
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:22,959
You're dead, Tommy.

660
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,680
You're out of your fucking depth.

661
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:28,120
You're dead already.

662
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,359
You threatened to sell to the Jews.

663
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:34,279
And I have contacts in this prison.

664
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:36,599
These boys here will look after you
during your stay.

665
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,799
I don't need your fucking
people to look after me.

666
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,359
Jack Nelson's getting me
out of here.

667
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:42,560
Oh, yeah? Is he?

668
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:45,239
This is a letter.

669
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:47,479
Here, give him this letter, will ya?

670
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:49,999
This is a letter from the
President's personal secretary,

671
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,079
suggesting Jack Nelson keep you
in here for a while longer.

672
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:55,640
Just until the press lose interest,
Michael.

673
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:00,079
Fuck you.

674
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:02,479
You'll be released eventually.

675
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:06,240
And then you can execute your
business with me as before.

676
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:11,479
Our business being $5 million
for a shipment of powder.

677
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:14,199
And when the exchange is done,
we can shake hands

678
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:16,560
and go our separate ways
once more, eh?

679
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:21,880
So, you didn't learn.

680
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:26,279
When my mother died at
the hands of your ambition,

681
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:28,120
you didn't learn your limitations.

682
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:32,280
I have no limitations.

683
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:40,559
Oh, and by the way, Michael,

684
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:43,359
according to Jack Nelson's
personal accounts,

685
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:47,319
he bought passage for five people
from Boston to Liverpool.

686
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:50,519
Five people - his wife,
his mistress,

687
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:53,520
President Roosevelt's son,
himself...

688
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:56,520
..and Gina Gray.

689
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,840
Gina's coming to London, Michael...

690
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:04,479
..where I will be happy
to show her the sights.

691
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:06,599
Fuck! You fucking bastard, Tommy!

692
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:09,999
Spirits, Boston Irish and Uncle Jack.
You're the devil, Tommy Shelby!

693
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,440
You're the fucking devil!
I'm ready for the conversation.
