Yes sir, Mr. Milk. Thank you.

160
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:37,031
At the bottom of the list.

161
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,164
Oh, hell nah.

162
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,376
What the fuck do you want?

163
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:50,537
What, I can't visit me old mate?

164
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:52,745
Rekindle the unbreakable bonds
of brothers-in-arms?

165
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:55,166
- Nope.
- Come on, M.M.

166
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,545
Bring it in.

167
00:11:57,592 --> 00:11:59,695
Look, if it's all the same,
let's just cut the small talk.

168
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,389
All you're gonna do is lie
and say how you're doing fine,

169
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,811
and I'm gonna lie and pretend
like I'm happy to see you.

170
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,480
Why are you here?

171
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:12,687
All right.

172
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,402
- How'd you like to come back, have another go?
- Mm-mm.

173
00:12:15,444 --> 00:12:17,954
No, sir. Keep it to yourself.

174
00:12:17,988 --> 00:12:21,528
I don't want to know nothing
about nothing.

175
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:25,075
I'm a happy man now.
Life is good,

176
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,790
- Monique is back, we're good, just...
- Oh, yeah? How is Monique?

177
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:29,791
Spits on the ground
every time your name comes up.

178
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,293
I can't do that
to her again, man.

179
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:35,455
Not to mention, I'm actually
making progress with these boys.

180
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:36,755
Yeah, so I can see.

181
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:38,838
(indistinct shouting)

182
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:42,053
Don't make me come out there!

183
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,555
Well, this is God's work.

184
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:48,808
I can't argue with that.
But a man of your talents?

185
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:51,442
- Wasted here.
- Look, Butcher,

186
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,520
we were into some bad shit, man.

187
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:57,355
Even before the Mallory stuff.
And that, that was...

188
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:59,742
(sighs)

189
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,489
If I'm gonna make a difference,

190
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:04,201
I just feel more comfortable
doing it on a smaller scale.

191
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:05,952
I'm a motherfucker with a heart.

192
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:07,414
Whereas you?

193
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,370
You're just a motherfucker.

194
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:18,590
Funny you should mention
making a difference...

195
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:24,256
...'cause we just dusted a Supe.

196
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,184
Bullshit.

197
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:27,813
Translucent.

198
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:30,938
What the f...

199
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:35,361
Well, come on,
you lime-sucking smart-ass.

200
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:37,148
How the hell did you do it?

201
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:40,782
Well...

202
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,780
Big lump of C-4,
packed right up his fudger.

203
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:48,704
Boom. Claret everywhere,
fucking diabolical.

204
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:52,535
But before the fireworks,
he coughed up a solid lead.

205
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,382
Spilled the beans in a big way.

206
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:55,957
Now, we play this right,

207
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:58,382
we could shake up
the whole hornets' nest,

208
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:01,381
bring down Seven
and Vought at the same time.

209
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:02,514

Mm-hmm.

This is about Becca, isn't it?

213
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,890
It's always about Becca
with you.

214
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:15,436
Oh, you ain't got your reasons?

215
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,817
(sighs)

216
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,029
It'll be different this go,
all right?

217
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,320
None of that
"secrets and lies" bollocks.

218
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,744
And that Mallory shit
ain't gonna happen this time.

219
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:28,833
I swear to God.

220
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:35,325
Are you bringing Frenchie back?

221
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,785
'Cause I can't work
with that motherfucker.

222
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:40,296
Frenchie?
No, I ain't seen him in years.

223
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:45,009
M.M., you're the only bloke
I can trust.

224
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:46,431
(chuckles)

225
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:49,349
Since when
have you ever trusted anybody?

226
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:52,559
Oh, fuck.

227
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:54,662
CHUCK TODD: Senator Calhoun,
you've gone on the record

228
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:56,330
- against superheroes in the military.
- MADELYN: Who's a good boy?

229
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:57,832
- Who's a good boy?
- Why change your tune?

230
00:14:57,856 --> 00:14:59,476
No one's changing their tune.

231
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:01,364
Uh, it's just I realized that

232
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:04,151
- it's an issue that affects all Americans.
- (Teddy babbling)

233
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:07,091
- Can't you make it... stop?
- It shouldn't be decided by a few congressmen

234
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:08,467
- hidden in committee.
- He's not crying.

235
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:09,831
The bill needs to go
to the floor.

236
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:10,868
Oh, okay.

237
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,200
Aw. Aw.
(gasps)

238
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:13,865
Oh, no. We can't have that...

239
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:17,173
You know, I heard Translucent's
tracking chip went dead.

240
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,958
- Yeah?
- He could be hurt.

241
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:20,963
(chuckles)
How?

242
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:22,304
He's got diamond skin.

243
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:23,629
He's gonna be fine.

244
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:24,923
My guys are on it.

245
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:26,926
All right,
I forgot to give you these.

246
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:28,138
Here.

247
00:15:28,178 --> 00:15:29,388
What is it?

248
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,219
Those are
your new talking points.

249
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:34,144
Now that the military bill
is out of committee,

250
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:36,774
corporate wants
to sell the shit out of it.

251

Yes. They do.

(giggling)

253
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:44,738
Hey. Y-You remember when
you wanted me in the red cape

254
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:46,658
and-and I said,
"No. No, no, no.

255
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:48,986
Make it the flag"?
Remember that?

256
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:50,992
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah. I don't need these.

257
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:52,994
Okay?

258
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:55,156
I can sell my way
into the military.

259
00:15:55,205 --> 00:15:57,245
- (paper crumpling)
- Thank you.

260

You take care of your baby,
and I'll take care of mine.

Mr. Edgar wrote
those personally.

So if you want to go to 82

317
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,140
Yeah. Me, too.

318
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:18,309
Baby, I just...

319
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:20,058
Uh, you're right, you're right.

320
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,559
I love you, too.

321
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,601
Okay. Bye.

322
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:27,404
- (kissing)
- (laughing)

323
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:32,821
(laughing)

324
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:36,779
Fuck all of y'all, okay?

325
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:38,365
(blows out lips)

326
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:40,289
All right. All right.

327
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:43,748
Listen, you two knobbers
kiss and make up, yeah?

328
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,580
We got a fucking job to do.

329
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:49,001
Fuck it. Dégage, huh?

330
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:51,085
- (kissing)
- Get out of here.

331
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,800
Who's this guy?

332
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:54,221
The new lad. Hughie.

333
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:56,139
Hughie, Mother's Milk.

334
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:58,467
That's a... nickname?

335
00:18:58,513 --> 00:19:00,973
No, my mother actually named me
Mother's Milk.

336
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:03,265
- Did-did she?
- So we got

337
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:05,037
a French whore
and a Stephen fucking Hawking.

338
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:06,691
- Great job, Butcher.
- Well, it was

339
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:09,319
Stephen fucking Hawking
who dusted the Supe.

340
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:11,775
Oh.

341
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:13,779
She's home.

342
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:14,964
HUGHIE:
That's Popclaw, right?

343
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:16,158
A-Train's girlfriend?

344
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:21,329
Oh, Popclaw. Hi.

345
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:22,699
Uh, you know the-the rent?

346
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:26,075
- It was due last week.
- Right. Of course.

347
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:27,476
MOTHER'S MILK: You think her
and A-Train are, uh...

348
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,250
BUTCHER:
Yeah, playing bury the bishop.

349
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:31,146
Didn't hear nothing about it.
I'm usually up on these things.

350
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,481
BUTCHER:
According to Translucent,

351
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,715
A-Train knows this bird
inside out.

352
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:35,927
I'll drop the check off ASAP.

353
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:37,587
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

354
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:39,045
- Yeah.
- 'Kay.

355
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,983
BUTCHER: All right.
Let's get the bugs sorted,

356
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:47,559
see for ourselves.

357
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:54,235
Where-Where'd you get this shit,
Circuit City?

358
00:19:54,277 --> 00:19:57,157
Right? He's a cheap bastard.

359
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:03,406
You know, we don't actually need
to sneak in anything.

360
00:20:03,453 --> 00:20:06,583
- Eh?
- Look, all I need's her IPv6 number.

361
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:09,883
Every desktop, every smart TV
in the house has a camera on it.

362
00:20:09,918 --> 00:20:11,186
They probably have one
in every room.

363
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,380
- Even in the toilet?
- No, Frenchie,

364
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:15,024
not in the toilet. Look,
I just need five minutes inside.

365
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:17,218
I mean, home service
is my specialty.

366
00:20:24,182 --> 00:20:26,142
Hello, ma'am,
we're with Bryman Audio-Visual.

367
00:20:26,184 --> 00:20:28,984
We got the new router. I'm...

368
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,400
This is-is Hughie.

369
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:33,269
I'm Gary.

370
00:20:33,316 --> 00:20:35,210
- I didn't make an appointment.
- Oh, well, your manager did.

371
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,324
- He's upgrading the whole building.
- I just saw

372
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:39,072
my landlord.
He didn't mention it.

373
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:41,823
I've got a work order
right here, ma'am.

374
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:44,656
HUGHIE:
Only takes a second.

375
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:47,372
And we can get you all the way
up to a thousand Mbps.

376
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:49,003
That-That's a lot.

377
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,830
Okay. Come on in.

378
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,567
- (door closes)
- The computer's right over here

379
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:00,971
- if you need it.
- Uh, yeah.

380
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,404
I just need
to sign on to your server

381
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:04,138
in order to download
the service package.

382
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,350
- Yeah, sure.
- I have a confession.

383
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:08,231
We're really big fans. I mean,

384
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,477
Terminal Beauty 3...

385
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:11,649
Whew. Damn.

386
00:21:11,688 --> 00:21:14,068
Oh. Thanks.

387
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:17,397
Yeah, that one
really came together.

388
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,613
Let me know
if you guys need anything else.

389
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:21,664
Thank you.

390
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:40,222
You gonna eye-fuck that all day?

391
00:21:40,258 --> 00:21:42,508
Let's go.

392
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:51,847
(keys clacking)

393
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:55,191
Hmm.

394
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:57,071
What is it?

395
00:21:57,108 --> 00:21:58,648
Nothing.

396
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:01,954
(exhales)

397
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:11,617
(chuckles)

398
00:22:20,882 --> 00:22:23,012
This kid is full of surprises.

399
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:25,091
HUGHIE:
Okay, ma'am, all done.

400
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:26,506
(exhales)

401
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:27,854
Thank you, guys.

402
00:22:27,889 --> 00:22:30,019
Thank you.

403
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:31,518
MOTHER'S MILK:
Get your John Hancock?

404
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:33,139
- POPCLAW: Oh, sure.
- Thank you.

405
00:22:33,186 --> 00:22:34,476
(exhales)

406
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,360
Ooh. Excuse me, bud.

407
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:50,367
What, you want a...
autograph or something?

408
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:02,969
Haven't we met before?

409
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:09,677
Maybe.

410
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:11,602
I meet a ton of people.

411
00:23:11,641 --> 00:23:13,431
Come on, man.
My meter's running out.

412
00:23:13,476 --> 00:23:15,386
Let's go.
Let's get out of here.

413
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:17,766
- Excuse us, brother.
- Yeah.

414
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:24,357
You trying to get us killed?

415
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:27,323
♪ ♪

416
00:23:27,365 --> 00:23:30,075
(grunting)

417
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:53,181
- (phone ringing)
- (grunting)

418
00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:00,567
Yeah.

419
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:02,226
(sighs)

420
00:24:02,275 --> 00:24:04,395
I'll be right there.

421
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,243
Look, Translucent's
probably just lurking

422
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:08,069
around a gynecologist's office
or something.

423
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:09,508
- For two days? Come on.
- (gunfire in distance)

424
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:10,742
I don't get it.

425
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:12,453
Why is no one concerned
about this?

426
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:14,753
Because if people find out
one of the Seven is missing,

427
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:16,287
they panic.

428
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:19,290
Besides, you can't fucking stand
Translucent.

429
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:21,673
- Give 'em hell, Homelander!
- Yeah, you bet, pal.

430
00:24:21,711 --> 00:24:23,671
Of course. But if something's
happened to him,

431
00:24:23,713 --> 00:24:25,673
then that's a direct attack
on the Seven,

432
00:24:25,715 --> 00:24:27,755
which is a direct attack on me.

433
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,194
You've managed
to make this about you

434
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:30,598
in less than 20 seconds flat.

435
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:32,447
Hey, I'm not the one who's down
a point and a half.

436
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,101
So I think
what you mean to say is,

437
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,770
"Gee, thanks, Homelander,

438
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:37,268
"for showing up out of the blue

439
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,745
and bringing the extra press
to my collar."

440
00:24:38,769 --> 00:24:40,809
Homelander. Maeve.

441
00:24:40,855 --> 00:24:44,145
Captain, you guys
are the real heroes.

442
00:24:44,192 --> 00:24:46,442
- We're just glad we can help, right?
- That's right.

443
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,565
- Where's your shooter?
- Shooter's on 31.

444
00:24:48,613 --> 00:24:49,783
All right. Sit tight.

445
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:54,368
(sighs)

446
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,080
Elevators?

447
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,120
(elevator bell dings)

448
00:24:59,874 --> 00:25:01,924
I'm just saying,
a missing team member

449
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:05,089
is more important
than A-Train's insipid race.

450
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:07,589
(sighs) Mr. Edgar
wants us both at the race

451
00:25:07,632 --> 00:25:09,342
to roll out
his new talking points.

452
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:10,473
You know this.

453
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,549
I've X-rayed Edgar, you know.

454
00:25:12,595 --> 00:25:14,885
He is this close to a coronary.

455
00:25:14,931 --> 00:25:16,891
He's got blood like engine oil.

456
00:25:16,933 --> 00:25:19,983
And Stillwell,
with that mewling baby...

457
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:21,809
it's ridiculous.

458
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:23,654
They're just people.

459
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:25,649
But they snap their fingers
and we jump.

460
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:27,401
- Why? Why do we do that?
- (sighs)

461
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:29,953
- 'Cause they sign our checks.
- (muffled gunfire)

462
00:25:29,987 --> 00:25:31,157
Can we just cut to the part

463
00:25:31,197 --> 00:25:34,157
where you show up to the race
anyway?

464
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,740
(chuckles)

465
00:25:35,785 --> 00:25:37,615
See, that's why I love you.

466
00:25:38,663 --> 00:25:40,793
You're the only one

467
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:42,751
who tells me the truth.

468
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:45,672
(clanging)

469
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:48,421
(grunting)

470
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:52,721
Mm-mm.

471
00:25:56,222 --> 00:25:58,022
(choking)

472
00:25:58,057 --> 00:26:00,847
(shushing)

473
00:26:02,979 --> 00:26:04,809
(whispers):
It's all over.

474
00:26:04,855 --> 00:26:07,315
(man choking,
Homelander shushing)

475
00:26:07,358 --> 00:26:09,778
(whispers):
It's all over now.

476
00:26:09,819 --> 00:26:11,739
There you go.

477
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:24,459
Goddamn it.

478
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,680
That was my collar.

479
00:26:32,717 --> 00:26:34,677
Eh, it still is.

480
00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:37,639
Yeah, well, I can't walk him
on The Today Show like that.

481
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,390
(chuckles)
No, that's true.

482
00:26:39,432 --> 00:26:40,932
I got excited.

483
00:26:40,975 --> 00:26:42,305
I'm sorry.

484
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:44,191
- I'm sure you are.
- (whistles)

485
00:26:44,228 --> 00:26:45,188
You know the drill.

486
00:26:45,229 --> 00:26:46,649
He shot at us first.

487
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:51,185
Attagirl.

488
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:58,368
(blows, chuckles)

489
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:02,913
The things I let you do to me.

490
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:04,165
Yeah.

491
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:05,706
We're not even dating anymore.

492
00:27:14,717 --> 00:27:16,587

Fuck.

493

00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:27,149
Want me to do the thing?

497
00:27:27,188 --> 00:27:29,608
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

498
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,438
Okay.

499
00:27:33,861 --> 00:27:36,861
POPCLAW:
That's a good boy.

500
00:27:40,534 --> 00:27:42,704
Mmm.

501
00:27:47,792 --> 00:27:51,212

502
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:53,343
Oh, stop. Stop, stop.

503
00:27:53,381 --> 00:27:55,761
(laughs)
Tickles. Tickling.

504
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,717
What's the problem?

505
00:28:00,763 --> 00:28:02,813
Shockwave's the problem.

506
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:04,268
What if I lose?

507
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:06,058
You're not gonna lose.

508
00:28:06,102 --> 00:28:08,232
You're the fastest man alive.

509
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,060
Until I'm not.

510
00:28:10,106 --> 00:28:12,106
You know what Stillwell told me?

511
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:13,649
If I don't win, I'm out.

512
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:17,412
Nobody wants the second
fastest man in The Seven.

Babe.

514
00:28:27,081 --> 00:28:30,211
Compound V. Where'd you put it?

515
00:28:30,251 --> 00:28:34,001
POPCLAW: Oh, you sure, babe?
I mean, that stuff, it...

516
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:36,466
amps you up something fierce.

517
00:28:36,507 --> 00:28:37,837
Remember last time?

518
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:39,763
Last time's not gonna
happen again.

519
00:28:39,802 --> 00:28:42,932
I'm under control. Uh...

520
00:28:42,972 --> 00:28:45,682
You ran through a girl, baby.

521
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,944
That's not what
I would call "control."

522
00:28:48,978 --> 00:28:51,688
That shit's a slippery slope.

523
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,520
Take it from me.

524
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:55,526
No, I... I need it.

525
00:28:55,568 --> 00:28:58,398
POPCLAW: Honey, I'll still
love you even if you lose.

526
00:28:58,446 --> 00:29:00,906
How is that supposed
to help me right now?

527
00:29:00,948 --> 00:29:04,618
- Uh...
- I have to win this thing.

528
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:07,160
I don't want to be
some washed up B-squader.

529
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:09,584
Like me?

530
00:29:09,623 --> 00:29:11,133
No, not like... That's...

531
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:16,299
(A-Train sighs)

532
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:19,129
I got to go.

533
00:29:19,175 --> 00:29:22,215
Why don't you just tell me
where the V is, please?

534
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:24,971
I'll come back to see you
tomorrow after the race.

535
00:29:26,015 --> 00:29:28,175
What are you talking about?

536
00:29:30,186 --> 00:29:32,016
I've been meaning to tell you.

537
00:29:32,062 --> 00:29:34,522
Are you kidding me?

538
00:29:34,565 --> 00:29:37,815
I have been getting my hair
done, threading my eyebrows,

539
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:40,740
waxing my body
like a plucked chicken,

540
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:43,739
so that we could finally
stand up there together tomorrow

541
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,832
in front of the world
as a couple.

542
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:48,618
I mean, it was all cleared
with Stillwell and everything.

543
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,830
A-TRAIN:
Um...

544
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:54,883
You did clear it with Stillwell.

545
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:58,209
Look, our time is gonna come,
I promise,

546
00:29:58,255 --> 00:30:00,665
but I got to get
my leverage back first.

547
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,220
Where's the V?

548
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,059
- What the hell is Compound V?
- MOTHER'S MILK: Sounds like

549
00:30:13,103 --> 00:30:14,773
some kind
of performance enhancer.

550
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,113
- Steroids for Supes?
- Yeah. Well, whatever it was,

551
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:19,399
he was juiced on it
when he murdered Robin.

552
00:30:38,128 --> 00:30:40,088
(sniffles)

553
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:41,380
What are you grinning at?

554
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:43,133
Oh, I don't know, mate.

555
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:45,675
Maybe it's 'cause
The Seven might just be a squad

556
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:48,309
of manky 'roid heads.

557
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:50,767
Now this is exactly the kind
of malfeasance that Langley

558
00:30:50,808 --> 00:30:52,308
is gonna eat up by the spoonful.

it does what we think it does.

If we get a bit,
can you work it out?

561
00:30:57,064 --> 00:30:58,833
FRENCHIE: Oh, I can run
some tests, of course.

562

But there's no way of knowing

Everything comes with a price.

The last thing
I ever said to Robin...

598
00:33:04,108 --> 00:33:08,948
was "Don't you ever
besmirch Billy Joel."

That was the last thing

829
00:45:14,963 --> 00:45:16,923
one fastest man in the world,

830
00:45:16,965 --> 00:45:18,715
and that's the A-Train, baby!
(chuckles)

831
00:45:18,758 --> 00:45:20,588
- Yes, baby.
- REPORTER: A-Train,

832
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:23,465
how are you celebrating tonight?
Any special girl?

833
00:45:23,513 --> 00:45:25,523
Uh... well, you know me.

834
00:45:26,558 --> 00:45:28,228
I'm always in the game,

835
00:45:28,268 --> 00:45:30,558
but I'm too fast to catch.

836
00:45:30,603 --> 00:45:33,693
I'm open to offers,
though, ladies.

837
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:35,281
There's plenty to go around.

838
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:36,502
REPORTER:
A-Train, how have you managed

839
00:45:36,526 --> 00:45:38,026
to stay on top all this time?

840
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:40,029
What's your secret?

841
00:45:40,071 --> 00:45:43,031
A-TRAIN:
Secret? There's no secret.

842
00:45:43,074 --> 00:45:45,794
It's just about discipline
and training

843
00:45:45,827 --> 00:45:48,157
and keeping your head
in the game, staying focused.

- You said it.

850
00:46:09,601 --> 00:46:11,191
She's been at it for an hour.

851
00:46:11,227 --> 00:46:13,097
POPCLAW:
Come and get me!

852
00:46:13,146 --> 00:46:15,686
How'd you know
to keep an eye on her?

853
00:46:15,732 --> 00:46:17,612
Okay.

854
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:18,940
You see that red case
over there?

855
00:46:18,985 --> 00:46:20,645
I've been around long enough
to know

856
00:46:20,695 --> 00:46:22,355
a fix kit when I see one.

857
00:46:22,405 --> 00:46:25,825
And she told A-Train
that V's a slippery slope.

858
00:46:25,867 --> 00:46:27,537
So she's got experience.

859
00:46:27,577 --> 00:46:29,096
I figured if you wait around
long enough,

860
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,830
two plus two equals nasty.

861
00:46:30,872 --> 00:46:32,752
Sherlock fucking Homie.

862
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:34,540
Now admit it.

863
00:46:34,584 --> 00:46:37,964
This beats babysitting
delinquents any day, don't it?

You can wait there if you want,

877

minutes to write the check.

Okay, let's get that check.

You want a drink, Alek,

You're a filthy pig. Say it.

And even if
you had've got there,

she would have clawed
your fucking head off.

right where we want her.

What are you talking about?

Whatever the price,
you'll pay it.

Where is the fire?

No, no, not fire. Water.

00:51:20,995 --> 00:51:23,495
Just ask my little guppy here.

You can show her.

00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:33,217
Well, a very good friend of mine

959
00:51:33,257 --> 00:51:34,717
- found this.
- It was a porpoise.

960
00:51:34,759 --> 00:51:37,299
A fucking porpoise found this
at the bottom

961
00:51:37,345 --> 00:51:38,675
of the harbor.

962
00:51:41,933 --> 00:51:43,733
Go ahead, don't be shy.

963
00:51:50,483 --> 00:51:51,653
(gasps)

964
00:51:51,692 --> 00:51:53,742
Oh! Jesus Christ.

965
00:51:53,778 --> 00:51:55,108
Is that Translucent?

966
00:51:55,154 --> 00:51:57,324
Still think we got nothing
to worry about?

967
00:51:57,365 --> 00:51:59,655
How did they even get through
his skin?

968
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,660
What kind of maniac...

969
00:52:01,702 --> 00:52:04,502
Mm-mm. Not maniac.

970
00:52:04,539 --> 00:52:07,539
Smart, actually.

971
00:52:07,583 --> 00:52:10,673
Very smart.

972
00:52:10,711 --> 00:52:15,011
Hey, Deep,
what can't I see through?

973
00:52:15,049 --> 00:52:17,549
- Zinc, Homelander.
- Correct.

974
00:52:17,593 --> 00:52:19,603
And what's the box made of,
Deep?

975
00:52:22,765 --> 00:52:25,765
- Zinc.
- Correct again.

976
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:28,520
(chuckles): They also knew
that we'd find Translucent...

977
00:52:28,563 --> 00:52:31,363
what's left of him...
eventually.

978
00:52:31,399 --> 00:52:33,569
So they were just buying time.

979
00:52:33,609 --> 00:52:35,399
Why do you say that?

980
00:52:35,444 --> 00:52:37,574
I'm so glad you asked.

981
00:52:49,292 --> 00:52:52,132
Whoever it was...

982
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:54,589
they just declared war.
