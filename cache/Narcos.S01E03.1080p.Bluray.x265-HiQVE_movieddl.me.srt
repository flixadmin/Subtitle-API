19
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,763
I'm more of a dog man myself,
but no cat deserves this.

20
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,922
Did you tell anyone
about why you were down here?

21
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,968
Someone on the plane?
Someone you met at a restaurant?

22
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,121
'Course not.

23
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,125
Not to get personal,
but have you had any, uh... encounters?

24
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,930
- "Encounters"?
- Yeah.

25
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,207
I'm married.

26
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,646
Right.

27
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,045
Only people I've encountered
outside the DEA and my wife

28
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,645
are those Colombian cops in Medellín.

29
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,211
No, no, Carrillo's solid.

30
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,084
Did anyone have access
to your credentials?

31
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,601
Did you drop your wallet?

32
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,761
Passport.

33
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,809
How important is this cat to you?

34
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,407
Excuse me?

35
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,210
You gave someone your passport?

36
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,408
We were trying to get Puff
through Immigration.

37
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,766
"Puff"?

38
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,564
I didn't name it, dude.

39
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,405
Traffickers pay people
at the airports for intel.

40
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,609
A gringo coming in from Miami raises
suspicions. That's how you got made.

41
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,249
Don't let it rattle you.
That's what they want.

42
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,085
You probably got a price on your head,
but no one's gonna take the contract.

43
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,241
Fucking price on my head?

44
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:25,769
There's a standing bounty
of 350,000 US on any DEA down here,

45
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,650
but you're safe... because of Kiki.

46
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,848
The "Kiki" Peña was referring to

47
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,370
was Kiki Camarena, a DEA agent who went
after the Guadalajara cartel in Mexico.

48
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,727
Kiki was captured and tortured.

49
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,804
They skinned his legs,
put a bullet in each limb,

50
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,406
used an electric drill on his head
until he died.

51
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,448
What the fuck were they thinking?

52
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,889
They could kill an American
government agent and get away with it?

53
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,726
Uncle Sam doesn't fuck around.
The cocksuckers paid in blood.

54
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,080
They went after them so hard,
every single narco in the world

55
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,040
got the message
that the DEA is off-limits.

56
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,646
Kiki was like Jesus Christ to us.

57
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,960
He died to save us all.

58
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,250
Do not tell Connie that story.

59
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,646
I won't.

60
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,121
- But you shouldn't forget it either.
- Why?

61
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,287
This cat is DEA.

62
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,488
Mark my words, it will get justice.

63
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,606
My name is everywhere.

64
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,725
Newspapers...

65
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,525
magazines...

66
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:24,085
Everyone is talking about
the "Paisa Robin Hood."

67
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,964
Pablito, I'm sorry.
If I had known that...

68
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,361
You're going to have
to pay for that, my love.

69
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,362
Anything you want, Pablito.

70
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,409
Anything I want?

71
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,847
Yes, my love, whatever you want.

72
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,485
You sure?

73
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,244
Uh-huh.

74
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,960
Then...

75
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,408
you're going to help me
get into Congress.

76
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,720
Yes, Pablo.

77
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,360
Yes.

78
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,887
Those shitty oligarchs.

79
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,401
Those people,
all of their lives...

80
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,401
don't know what it's like to wonder
where their next meal is coming from.

81
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,881
I come from nothing, Valeria...

82
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,080
and I have more money
than any of those sons of bitches.

83
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,051
If you run for Congress, you put yourself
in the public eye, you become a target.

84
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,490
"I made my money from taxis" isn't going
to work when you face the press.

85
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,367
Pablo, you need a party that supports you.

86
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,609
You need a proper political campaign.

87
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,963
I buy the press, my love.

88
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,810
And as far as a political party,

89
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,884
I am quite sure
that I can buy one of those as well.

90
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,685
I don't want to be good.

91
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,769
I am going to be great.

92
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,762
A PAISA ROBIN HOOD

93
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,401
A drug dealer running
for president. it was crazy, right?

94
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,609
Well, not in Colombia.
Not in the mid-'80s.

95
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,969
As far as Colombians go,
Pablo wasn't a drug dealer at all.

96
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,168
He was a fucking winner.

97
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,891
The living embodiment
of the Colombian dream.

98
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,089
The guy who'd buy houses for the poor
in exchange for nothing.

99
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,407
As far as Pablo could tell, the doors
to political success were there...

100
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,568
and all he had to do was to get to them.

101
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,963
And in order to do that,

102
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:54,011
he asked Valeria Velez
to introduce him to Fernando Duque.

103
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:03,040
Duque was a lawyer and a lobbyist
who represented the New Liberals,

104
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,851
a party who claimed
to represent the people.

105
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,722
Pablo!

106
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,962
I should've gotten into the taxi business.

107
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,288
- Valeria, how are you doing?
- Well, thank you.

108
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,771
Mr. Duque.

109
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,208
It gives me great pleasure to invite you
to the Hacienda Nápoles.

110
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,805
- Nice to meet you.
- Please, come.

111
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,840
After you, Valeria.

112
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,966
Please.

113
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:36,926
Look, I am not a rich person.
I am a poor person with money.

114
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,162
And for that reason,
I think that...

115
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,527
Well, I think that
I understand the people

116
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,807
to whom the New Liberalism
wants to give a voice.

117
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,488
The party clearly needs to hear
what you have to say, Mr. Escobar.

118
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,684
There is a great deal of talk
about how you have made your money.

119
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,606
I need guarantees
concerning the origins of your fortune.

120
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,607
And Valeria told you...
how much I am going to donate?

121
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,603
- No, no...
- Look, I am not a politician.

122
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,607
I am not a successful lawyer like you.
I come from the street... brother.

123
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,850
I want to reassure you
that you will receive your piece.

124
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,241
- It's not about that...
- Assuming your piece is ten percent,

125
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,810
your piece would be what?

126
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,327
$300,000 just for you.

127
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,684
Does that seem like a sufficient guarantee
for the Justice Minister or what?

128
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,161
- Most definitely.
- All right, then.

129
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,089
Let's go look at the hippos.
Come on.

130
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,891
Blackie.

131
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,246
Pablo?

132
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,446
- And what about me?
- What about you?

133
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,365
I don't get my piece?

134
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,282
No, my queen.
The thing is that you...

135
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,767
you're in this for love, right?

136
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,047
Look, Minister...

137
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,124
Escobar has founded schools, clinics.

138
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,567
He has created sources of employment
throughout Medellín.

139
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,211
The people love him,
and he loves the people.

140
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,011
And from a legal point of view,
his money is clean.

141
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,801
And according to Forbes Magazine,
he's a drug trafficker.

142
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:16,044
Are you going to believe all of that
American imperialist propaganda?

143
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,167
Take a look.

144
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:25,324
These are property holdings papers.

145
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,561
Look.

146
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,328
He's the owner of hundreds of properties
in Colombia and also the United States.

147
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,521
In addition,
this man has no criminal record.

148
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,002
If there was,
there would be proof of his background.

149
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,366
How much is he paying you?

150
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,242
I am thinking about our party, Minister.

151
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,881
Escobar is prepared
to contribute millions of dollars.

152
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,489
We already support Jairo Ortega
so that he can campaign in Antioquia.

153
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,211
Let's let Escobar be his alternate.

154
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,841
What do you prefer...
rumors and insinuations,

155
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,321
or fewer representatives in Congress?

156
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:11,604
And just like that...
an honest man blinked.

157
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,888
You're not going back to that comuna!

158
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,486
What, you want me to stay
in this apartment for the next two years?

159
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,689
Oh, my God, you do.

160
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,524
Honey, your cat was killed
as a warning to me.

161
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,767
Our cat.

162
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,001
OK, our cat.

163
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,762
What if you went back to Miami just for
a little while until things quiet down?

164
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:32,686
- Oh, you're gonna make them quiet down?
- You're that good, huh?

165
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,367
I'll tell you what. I'll agree to go back
to Miami if you agree to go back, too.

166
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,046
- You prepared to do that?
- I'm not giving in on this one!

167
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,251
OK. I'll be waiting to take you home.

168
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,607
I already stick out like a sore thumb.

169
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,967
The bodyguards
are only gonna draw more attention.

170
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,645
Just humor me.

171
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,764
I can't do my job
if I'm worried about your safety.

172
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,682
Mm...

173
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,048
Hey, mind parking
down the street a little?

174
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,685
I'll scream if I need you.

175
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,410
- Buenos días, Father.
- Connie.

176
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,005
What, are you surprised to see me?

177
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,726
We've had American volunteers.
They come and go.

178
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,370
Well, this one will keep coming.

179
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,004
Surprised to see Elisa,
a communist M-19 guerrilla,

180
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,605
working in the comuna?

181
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,441
That's because you don't know
the liberation church in Colombia.

182
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,490
And the priest... innocent, right?

183
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,404
Wrong.
He's more of a commie than she is.

184
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,289
Who is the gringa?

185
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,010
A child of God, just like you.

186
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,889
Hm. Got it.

187
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,924
Let's see, you are here for a cat?

188
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:06,527
This isn't just any cat.
This is a gringo cat of the DEA.

189
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,251
- What's he saying?
- I'm telling him about the cat.

190
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,881
And what you want
is for me to find a cat killer.

191
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:17,290
It was the narcos, Suárez.
We don't take this shit lightly.

192
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,450
Your friend is a little crazy.

193
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,887
No hablo español.
I don't know what you're saying.

194
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,326
I don't speak English.

195
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,842
Get me some information, Suárez.

196
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,729
Look, I don't have enough people

197
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,805
to go through hundreds of hours of chatter
over a fucking cat.

198
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,601
If this was information about the narcos,
yes, my people are interested.

199
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,409
But they won't give a fuck about the cat.

200
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,245
- What is he saying?
- They don't like cats in this country.

201
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,651
Tell me about it.

202
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,247
But if you want
to put all my people to work

203
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,042
to find out who killed the fucking cat,
that is going to cost you more.

204
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,162
They broke into the house to kill his cat.

205
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,850
I think they made him
when he arrived at the airport in Bogotá.

206
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,126
Find out.

207
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,688
- Is that a D-103?
- Yup.

208
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,571
Let me get this straight.
Gotta pay this cop off for information,

209
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,167
- then you gotta get a receipt?
- I gotta get reimbursed.

210
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,167
This gentleman is an employee
of the American Embassy in our country,

211
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:23,370
and he assures me that you gave out his
personal information to certain criminals.

212
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,650
That's not true.

213
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,206
These guys killed his cat.

214
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,441
Maybe you don't know this,
but the mistreatment of animals

215
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,851
is a federal crime.

216
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,481
Is this funny to you?

217
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,888
They can bring formal charges against you,
and you could lose your job.

218
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,770
Do you not need your job, Santiago?

219
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,006
Yes, I need it.

220
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:00,287
Mr. Murphy,
do you recognize these men?

221
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,129
Yeah, you guys
stalled me at the airport

222
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,807
so you could take my passport
and copy and scan it, didn't you?

223
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,962
- What?
- May I?

224
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,441
You both are being accused
of conspiring against a federal agent

225
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,124
of the United States.

226
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,930
The cat is under the jurisdiction
of the American government.

227
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,890
And to kill it is the same
as to kill a police dog.

228
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,525
This is absurd.

229
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,680
Look, I'm a Colombian citizen,
and I know exactly my...

230
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,926
You will not disrespect them!

231
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,725
Is that clear?

232
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:44,569
If I open my mouth, they kill me...
and they kill my wife.

233
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,041
He's having problems with his wife.

234
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,321
Shut up!

235
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,288
- Imbecile.
- OK, gentlemen.

236
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,770
This is quite simple.

237
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:01,207
I can get the phone number of the person
to whom you sent those documents,

238
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,968
and I can tell him that you accused him
of being the cat killer.

239
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,531
How does that sound?

240
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,771
I sent a copy of that passport...

241
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,088
to a man they call...

242
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,682
"Poison."

243
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,609
OK, Poison.

244
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,889
You're going to take this money
to Fernando Duque in Bogotá.

245
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,769
And this is the address.

246
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,207
If they stop you on the road,
just salute the official,

247
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,726
give them a little bribe
and continue forward.

248
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,760
No violence.

249
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,729
And you call me every two hours.

250
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,167
- Of course, boss. Whatever you say.
- OK, then. No showing off.

251
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,641
No showing off!

252
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:49,890
- Nice and simple. Go unnoticed.
- Got it.

253
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,527
What the fuck are you doing?

254
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,280
Getting ready, right?

255
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:00,047
You are meeting up with politicians,
not with gangsters.

256
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,162
Aren't they the same thing, boss?

257
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,207
Politicians scare easily.

258
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,209
You're fine with just a pistol.

259
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,846
Go to it, then.
Go to it, dumb-ass.

260
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,010
According to CNP wiretaps,
the sicario "Poison"

261
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,566
was recorded saying
he was driving to Bogotá this afternoon.

262
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,244
For what purpose, we don't know.

263
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:24,210
But if we don't respond
to the obvious threat to Agent Murphy,

264
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,771
we're sending the wrong message.

265
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,247
Police have the information,
then they should make the arrest.

266
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,482
No. No, if we leave it to them,
someone will sell us out.

267
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,211
The narcos have informants
in their department.

268
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,966
What Peña's driving at is that
Major Carrillo should man a roadblock.

269
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,804
- We can trust Carrillo.
- I don't have authority

270
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,087
- over the Colombian police.
- All due respect, Ambassador,

271
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,924
but you know where we are.

272
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,764
With enough money,
you can get anything done.

273
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,929
Excuse me for saying so...
but this isn't much of a roadblock, is it?

274
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,445
Well, if the roadblock is too obvious,

275
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,842
Pablo can be tipped off
by a cop or by a passerby, who knows.

276
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,527
Can anybody in this country
keep a secret?

277
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,481
I've got a spotter set up
about four kilometers away.

278
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,130
He's gonna let us know
when Poison passes.

279
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,442
You're gonna question them, right?
Because we need to...

280
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,011
Poison's killed three of my men already.

281
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,082
If I catch him alive,
you guys can question him here.

282
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,326
Then you guys gotta go.

283
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,849
Hey, hey, hey, hold on, 65?

284
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,365
Sixty-five.

285
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,608
Hey, brother, that's a lot.

286
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,284
You sure?

287
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,971
I counted every single son of a bitch.

288
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,610
All right!

289
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,286
Sure, but are you counting
what happened last night?

290
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,044
Of course, that was number 65.

291
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,687
Don't bullshit.
I was the one who shot that faggot.

292
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,525
- Bullshit.
- Bullshit...

293
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,409
if I was the one
who killed that little man.

294
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,803
You only shot him
once he was already on the ground, dead.

295
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,684
I shot him first.

296
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,486
Come in.

297
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,923
Did you give information about Poison
to the DEA?

298
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,206
So?

299
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,681
I'm still listening
to their phone conversations,

300
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,649
and it's not a shipment of drugs.

301
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,451
They're carrying
three million dollars to Bogotá,

302
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,045
and if two guys from the DEA
stop that car,

303
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,850
Pablo is going to hang you by the balls.

304
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,561
- You don't have 65, Poi.
- Yes, I do.

305
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,926
Eh!

306
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,767
What are you doing, Gonorrhea?!

307
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,446
Look, 65, man!

308
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,281
Now we're going
to have to wash the car, man!

309
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,568
Son of a bitch.

310
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,728
Yes?

311
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,404
Hi, Pablo.
I have good news for you.

312
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,967
I'm going to help you
avoid an enormous loss.

313
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,202
And how much is it going to cost me?

314
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,648
Ten percent... $300,000.

315
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,726
- How did you find out?
- One of your men.

316
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,202
That Poison... he talks too much.

317
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,522
You should take his phone away.

318
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,840
Five percent.

319
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,491
Suspicious vehicle approaching.

320
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,689
OK. We have visual
confirmation. Four kilometers away.

321
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,561
- Hello?
- Poison?

322
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,530
You bring your fucking mouth
back here immediately!

323
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,126
- Yes. I'm sorry, boss.
- Now!

324
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,561
The son of a bitch policeman
tapped my phone!

325
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:43,044
- These fags.
- You have a very big mouth, Poison.

326
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,730
Pablo is really pissed off.

327
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,842
Shut that mug,
or you will never reach 66, you hear?

328
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,806
OK!

329
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,651
I'm calling this off. Nobody's coming.

330
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,047
- What the fuck has happened here?
- Maybe Poison spotted the spotter.

331
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,725
Either that or Suárez sold you out.

332
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,201
Yeah, if he did,
he must've had a better offer,

333
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,129
and it wasn't a fucking cat.

334
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,528
He has been called the "Paisa Robin Hood,"

335
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,523
but he is much more than that.

336
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,286
He is a man to whom the people
mean a great deal. All of us.

337
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,284
To avoid suspicion
and questioning about his fortune,

338
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,649
Pablo ran as an alternate
for Jairo Ortega,

339
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,087
a former congressman from Antioquia.

340
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,722
It was the first time an alternate was
more important than the main candidate.

341
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:57,440
I am tired... of the
people with power running this country.

342
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:03,642
This is a fight between the people
with power and poor people, weak people.

343
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,530
And this fight must begin here!

344
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:16,682
To have power does not mean
that one can abuse the poor.

345
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,080
If I am elected...

346
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,561
if my friend, Jairo, is elected...

347
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,725
those who have never had a voice
will have a voice.

348
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,841
Those who are hungry will have food.

349
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,322
Those who want to learn will have schools.

350
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,046
And those who have dreams

351
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,364
will see that there are no limits
to what you can achieve.

352
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,411
In me, you have a friend

353
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,323
whom you have always had,

354
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:53,041
the friend of today, the friend
of yesterday and the friend of tomorrow.

355
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,447
Thank you very much.

356
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,685
- Pablo! Pablo! Pablo!
- Thank you very much.

357
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,244
My friend, Jairo Ortega!

358
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:22,048
Pablo! Pablo! Pablo!

359
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,361
Thank you very much.

360
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,804
- You were marvelous, my love.
- You sure?

361
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,770
- Yes.
- Very good, Pablo.

362
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,844
There are a few things we can improve,
but we'll work on them.

363
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,847
OK, whatever you say.

364
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,725
- Congratulations.
- Thank you so much, Valeria.

365
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,080
Congratulations, ma'am.

366
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,401
Excuse me.

367
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:02,566
To vote for Jairo Ortega
is to vote for the one and only Pablo!

368
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,127
Tata, what's wrong?

369
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,762
Why does that woman need to know
everything about each step you take?

370
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,604
What are you talking about?

371
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,968
- Valeria Velez.
- My love...

372
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:27,682
Tata, she's a newspaper woman,
a reporter who follows the news.

373
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,564
And right now, I'm the news.

374
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,244
When you win, don't disrespect me
anymore with that bitch.

375
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,085
Come here.
Come here, come here, come here.

376
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,686
Slowly... come on.

377
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,330
Come on.

378
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:50,640
You are going to be the First Lady
of this country one of these days.

379
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,802
Therefore, you are going
to have to learn to deal with the press.

380
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,804
That woman is not on your level, Pablo.

381
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,120
She degrades you.

382
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,851
Please, don't worry about Valeria.

383
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,168
Pablo!

384
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,887
A car, please!

385
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,088
A car to the hospital, now!

386
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,526
You know what, Pablo?

387
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,925
To me, it looks like
you are handling things very badly.

388
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:36,927
You need to start thinking more
about your family... and about business.

389
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,164
Thing is,
you can't be a politician.

390
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,206
Says who?

391
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:47,450
You can't go strutting around
giving things to people

392
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,249
simply so they will love you.

393
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:54,165
We... are bandits.

394
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:03,565
If you run for Congress, find someone else
to manage the laboratories.

395
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,768
Señor Escobar?

396
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,481
Come meet your daughter.

397
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,966
God has blessed us with a girl, Pablo.

398
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,488
How beautiful.

399
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:31,290
Shh.

400
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,444
Pablo is out of control.

401
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,883
Mother Mary, man.
What do you want us to do?

402
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:06,363
You can't give Pablo Escobar a spanking
as though he were some spoiled brat.

403
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,646
Oh, no?

404
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,646
And why not?

405
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,485
Careful with the threat
you cannot execute.

406
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,928
You know what he's doing, right?

407
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,006
According to Colombian law,
a congressman has total immunity.

408
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:29,290
Do you think he's protecting himself
while we remain in the drift?

409
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,643
I do. He thinks he's that fucking
"Paisa Robin Hood."

410
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,802
So what do we do?

411
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:40,205
Well... we fulfill our duties,
stuffing the ballot box,

412
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:45,320
and later we let Pablo receive
the applause, and take the risk.

413
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:51,442
We continue with our business...
in the shadows, like always.

414
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,928
Carlos, what are the guys saying?

415
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,760
I imagine that they're worried, right?

416
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,411
They are not politically conscious,
brother.

417
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,764
How can you expect them
to understand your objectives?

418
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,723
You do understand me, brother.

419
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:19,720
Imagine... a state governed by us.

420
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,171
Immunity for everyone, brother.

421
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,130
We, Carlos, belong to the people.

422
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,522
I need you to use your influence with the
others to convince them that I am right.

423
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,648
If you win,
you don't need to explain anything.

424
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:35,523
And if you lose...
there's nothing to explain.

425
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,170
I like that.

426
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,528
- Hitler said it.
- Fuck off.

427
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,125
Yes.

428
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,884
He also said that no politician

429
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:47,282
should ever let his picture be taken
in a bathing suit.

430
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,890
Well, that's what he said.

431
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,564
And if I tell you, Carlos...

432
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:20,121
That what I want, sincerely...

433
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,242
is to help the poor people
of this country...

434
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,325
do you believe me or what?

435
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,808
Pablo held most of his campaign rallies

436
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,565
in the poorest neighborhoods
of his electoral district.

437
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,371
He placed himself on the side
of the poor and the weak

438
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,888
in the fight against the oligarchs,
"The Men of Always."

439
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,405
And just like any politician,
he made plenty of promises.

440
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,804
Only difference was Pablo had the men
and the money to back them up.

441
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,800
It was becoming clear to everyone
that Pablo was gonna win.

442
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,331
Pablo! Pablo!

443
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,643
The only question remaining was...
what to do about that.

444
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,964
Gustavo made good on his promise
to quit the labs,

445
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:08,487
so Pablo put Carlos Lehder in charge.

446
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:13,208
With characteristic German efficiency,
he turned the labs into Nazilandia,

447
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:16,807
and production rose 12 percent
in just two short months.

448
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:22,768
Gacha and the Ochoas
adopted a wait-and-see attitude,

449
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,889
debating how and when
Pablo would dispose of Jairo Ortega,

450
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,008
his front man,
once the election was over.

451
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:32,922
As soon as the results
come out, Jairo Ortega will resign.

452
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,203
I say he's running toward his death.

453
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,046
As for us, we were kind of divided.

454
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,124
We cannot have Colombia
become a narco state.

455
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,124
We need to find someone
who can prove this guy is a drug dealer.

456
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,089
Let's stop his campaign before it starts.

457
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,889
No one will go on record.

458
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,530
I got a better idea.

459
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,090
We let him win.

460
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,368
If we put him in the spotlight
and prove he's a trafficker,

461
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,046
the embarrassment alone
might get this country off its ass.

462
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,044
But first, we had to get proof

463
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,640
that Pablo was the drug dealer
we knew he was.

464
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,882
So we went to Suárez,

465
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,327
and gave him a lot of money.

466
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:20,804
First, he told us that Pablo
was arrested for trafficking back in '76,

467
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:24,561
and then he gave us the name
of a sergeant who could give us the files.

468
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:32,888
Problem was, Suárez was on both the DEA
and the narcos' payroll.

469
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,129
- Sixty-six.
- Bullshit. I shot him first.

470
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,448
Then Suárez gave us
the name of the journalist

471
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,807
who reported the arrest...

472
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,565
...and then the lawyer
who defended Pablo...

473
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,764
and finally, the judge
who signed Pablo's arrest warrant.

474
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,206
We were like the Bermuda Triangle.

475
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,601
You get too close to us,
you disappear.

476
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,087
We gotta get something
on this motherfucker.

477
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,289
If he was arrested,
there's gotta be a mug shot.

478
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,328
Yeah, well, the file's gone.

479
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,881
If there was a mug shot,
then it's gone, too.

480
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,404
If there was a photo,
there's a negative.

481
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,443
Finally, it dawned on us.

482
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,968
We had to find someone
without Suárez's help,

483
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:29,523
and that was the photographer
who had taken Pablo's mug shot years ago.

484
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:37,881
We got his negatives, and for safekeeping,
we put him into witness protection.

485
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,127
- How long have you had this picture?
- That's classified.

486
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,041
And what am I doing here?

487
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,010
It's not America's role to get involved
in other countries' elections.

488
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,084
Once again, the hand
of the United States remains invisible.

489
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,003
Your party took money from Escobar.

490
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,844
I should think
you'd want to get ahead of this.

491
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,206
Everyone took money.

492
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:02,649
By the way, it's all American money,
so why don't you take this to the press?

493
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,610
It should come from you.
You're the Minister of Justice.

494
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:11,481
Come election day,
sure enough, it was a landslide.

495
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,927
The New Liberal party had the candidate

496
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,924
who got the most votes
in all of Antioquia...

497
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,162
and his name was Jairo Ortega.

498
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,129
Ladies and gentlemen,

499
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,283
with clear use of my
mental and physical faculties...

500
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,329
I wish to communicate to you my decision

501
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:32,166
to resign from my seat
in the Congress of the Republic...

502
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,881
...for reasons of family and health.

503
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:40,170
But I am completely certain that
my friend Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria

504
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,165
is going to continue
our social and political ideas,

505
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,085
because Pablo is the voice of the people.

506
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,128
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you very much, Jairo.

507
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,009
I will give my best effort.

508
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:51,962
Thank you very much.

509
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,846
Imagine you were born in a poor family,

510
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:31,845
in a poor city, in a poor country,

511
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,241
and by the time you were 28 years old,

512
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,369
you have so much money
you can't even count it.

513
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,124
What do you do?

514
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:45,409
You make your dreams come true.

515
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,365
Problem is, nobody can control
the dreams they have.

516
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,449
Especially if you were Pablo Escobar.

517
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:07,045
Especially if you grew up in Colombia.

518
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:15,289
There's a reason magical realism
was born in Colombia.

519
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:20,403
It's a country where
dreams and reality are conflated...

520
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,284
where, in their heads,
people fly as high as Icarus.

521
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,091
But even magical realism has its limits.

522
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:35,642
Congressman Escobar... Sir!

523
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,330
Excuse me.

524
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,971
Allow me to remind you
of the norms of etiquette.

525
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,281
You cannot enter the hall
if you don't have a tie.

526
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,520
All right.

527
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,967
- What is your name?
- Juan.

528
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,644
Look, Juan...

529
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:54,524
that is a really nice tie.

530
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,045
- My girlfriend gave it to me.
- Really?

531
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,485
Yes.

532
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:01,167
Well, she's in the history books now.

533
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,809
- Thank you very much, my son.
- Thank you, sir.

534
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,245
- Thank you.
- All right.

535
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,081
And when you get too close to the sun...

536
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,202
your dreams may melt away.

537
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,244
Good morning.

538
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,800
This is to inform you that we have
a quorum and may now begin our session.

539
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:43,204
The Minister of Justice,
Rodrigo Lara Bonilla,

540
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:46,125
is present here today
to address this honorable Congress.

541
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:49,762
I give the floor to you, Mr. Minister.

542
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,285
Thank you very much.

543
00:35:56,080 --> 00:36:01,007
Much has been made
of the issue of drug money,

544
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:06,644
"hot money,"
in our national political process.

545
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:11,601
I myself have been accused
of receiving campaign contributions

546
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,401
from the narcotics traffickers
who have bought influence in these halls.

547
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,960
To this charge, I plead guilty.

548
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:29,246
In my eyes,
the sin of turning a blind eye

549
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,641
is as great as the sin
of outright corruption.

550
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:35,441
We are a nation of the blind,
and in our blindness,

551
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,569
we have sold our country
to the highest bidder.

552
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,000
It's time for us to open our eyes
and to see the light.

553
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,765
Congressman Escobar...

554
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:58,125
you stated that your great fortune
was built from a taxi company.

555
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:04,480
This photograph
clearly contradicts your claim.

556
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,760
For this reason,
I demand your resignation.

557
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,048
You are not welcome in this chamber.

558
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,401
You don't belong here.

559
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,251
Thank you very much, Juan.
Very kind.

560
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,049
What interests the narcos

561
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:06,727
isn't just the fall
of the Minister of Justice,

562
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,726
but also to impede the strategy of
the government to combat his interests.

563
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,683
His two arms: silver or lead.

564
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:20,961
I want to inform the people
that the Minister of Justice has 24 hours

565
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,840
within which to present concrete proof
regarding the insinuations he made

566
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:27,890
the day before yesterday
in the Hall of Representatives.

567
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:32,170
To the contrary,
I will proceed to denounce him legally

568
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,050
before the authorities
and before the Colombian justice system.

569
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,726
Pablo and his lawyers went on the offense,

570
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,121
trying to smear Lara with accusations.

571
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:43,204
I am not looking
for, nor do I long for a confrontation

572
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,406
before the Colombian people.

573
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:48,007
I look for peace,
I have always preached peace,

574
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:52,005
and have longed for peace and
the prosperity of the Colombian people.

575
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,642
It's important to realize
that when members of Congress

576
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,770
can be threatened or bought at will,

577
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:03,289
we see with clarity the real dimension
of the drug problem here in Colombia.

578
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,050
But Lara wouldn't back down.

579
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,646
He denounced narcos at every opportunity,

580
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,644
going after the guys
that we hadn't been able to touch.

581
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,088
He revealed that six
of the country's nine soccer teams

582
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,889
were owned by drug traffickers.

583
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:21,410
Gacha the Mexican was forced
to give up ownership of his team,

584
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:24,006
aptly nicknamed "The Millionaires."

585
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:29,245
Lara denied flying permits
for 57 planes in the Ochoa fleet.

586
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,646
He even fined Pablo
for illegal importation

587
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,450
of elephants and camels from Africa.

588
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,087
And with the action of one brave man,

589
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,209
Pablo knew his dream
of presidency was over.

590
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,482
What are required are honest men,

591
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:52,248
men who are able to put themselves
up against drug traffickers,

592
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:59,204
who with complete tranquility buy or kill
any person or government institution

593
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,089
who is against their interests.

594
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:05,085
Rodrigo Lara became the most
important political figure in Colombia

595
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,208
with his stand against the narcos.

596
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,760
He just wouldn't stop going after them.

597
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:14,562
His bravery in the face of danger made him
the most wanted man in the country.

598
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:18,969
For his own safety, he was appointed
Colombian ambassador to Czechoslovakia.

599
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:23,602
He was slated to leave in two weeks,
but a lot could happen in two weeks.

600
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:27,490
I think it might be a good idea
for you to wear this until you leave.

601
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,486
You feel responsible, is that it?

602
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,451
Somewhat, yes, sir.

603
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:39,649
Are you so arrogant to think
you had any influence over my actions?

604
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,763
That I put my life
and the life of my family at risk

605
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,081
for American policy objectives?

606
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:50,889
Let me assure you, Agent Murphy,
outside of providing me with the picture,

607
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,610
you... did nothing.

608
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,006
The decision to speak out
was solely mine.

609
00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:00,004
And I highly advise you
to wear this vest, sir.

610
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:16,086
I will accept this vest... out of respect
for your concern with my well-being.

611
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:19,363
But I would advise you one thing
while you remain in Colombia.

612
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,771
And what is that?

613
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:25,209
We accept your help,
but never your condescension.

614
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:30,330
When all this is over, Colombians
will be the heroes, and the victims.

615
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:34,770
John Wayne only exists in Hollywood.

616
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,121
Just wear the vest.

617
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,202
Oh, Pablito.

618
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:55,085
We knew they wouldn't
accept you in that circle.

619
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,009
Damned bastards.

620
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,806
You're too good for them, Pablito.

621
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:34,644
This is a fight
that you cannot win, cousin.

622
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:40,442
You need to think more
about your family and the business...

623
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,481
and abandon that ridiculousness
once and for all.

624
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,565
I will fix it.

625
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:07,808
Due to the vicious lies
and slander cast my way

626
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:11,168
by Minister Lara and his cronies,

627
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:14,881
I've decided to announce my resignation
from Congress of the Republic.

628
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:20,567
I ran as a representative
for the common man,

629
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,530
a voice for those who had no voice,

630
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:27,002
but that has happened
through much of our history.

631
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:31,324
The powerful have conspired to silence me.

632
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,889
I dreamt of doing good.

633
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,364
Those dreams are over.

634
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:44,286
But make no mistake...
l will not go quietly.

635
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,691
I will fight.

636
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:50,005
"The Men of Always" are mistaken

637
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:54,404
if they think they can defeat
Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria!

638
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:06,721
Thank you very much.

639
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,720
Thank you very much.

640
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:35,921
He didn't wear it.

641
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,728
Wouldn't have made a difference.

642
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:44,643
Our strategy had gotten a good man killed.

643
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:49,323
It was the first time
I'd felt guilty about my job.

644
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,083
- As for Suárez...
- Hey.

645
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,561
...he made so much money
playing both sides,

646
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:04,010
he decided to lift our spirits by giving
the DEA a token of his appreciation.

647
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,407
I brought this for your friend's wife.

648
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,210
- I hope she likes it.
- No, gracias.

649
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:14,203
You're fucking crazy, asshole.

650
00:45:14,227 --> 00:45:16,227
