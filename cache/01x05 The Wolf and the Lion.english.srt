1
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,140
Does Ser Hugh have
any family in the capital?

2
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,770
No.

3
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:29,810
I stood vigil
for him myself last night.

4
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:32,810
He had no one else.

5
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,780
He'd never worn this armor before.

6
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,820
Bad luck for him -
going against the Mountain.

7
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,160
Who determines the draw?

8
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,410
All the knights draw straws, Lord Stark.

9
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,330
Aye.

10
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:49,620
But who holds the straws?

11
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,880
You've done good work, Sisters.

12
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,590
Life is strange.

13
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,140
Not so many years ago
we fought as enemies at the Trident.

14
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,180
I'm glad we never met
on the field, Ser Barristan.

15
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:10,520
As is my wife. I don't think
the widow's life would suit her.

16
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,850
You're too modest.

17
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,480
I've seen you cut down
a dozen great knights.

18
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:19,150
My father once told me
you were the best he'd ever seen.

19
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,200
I never knew the man to be wrong
about matters of combat.

20
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,320
He was a fine man, your father.

21
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,540
What the Mad King
did to him was a terrible crime.

22
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,250
And that lad -

23
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,370
he was a squire
until a few months ago.

24
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,500
How could he afford a new suit of armor?

25
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,960
Perhaps Lord Arryn
left him some money?

26
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:42,430
- I hear the king wants to joust today.
- Yes, that will never happen.

27
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:45,260
Robert tends
to do what he wants.

28
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:47,890
If the king got what
he wanted all the time,

29
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,520
he'd still be fighting
a damned rebellion.

30
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,570
It's made too small, Your Grace.
It won't go.

31
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:01,400
Your mother was
a dumb whore with a fat arse.

32
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:03,530
Did you know that?

33
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,080
Look at this idiot!
One ball and no brains.

34
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,000
He can't even put
a man's armor on him properly.

35
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,960
- You're too fat for your armor.
- Fat?

36
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,540
Fat, is it?

37
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:20,050
Is that how you speak to your king?

38
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,060
Oh, it's funny, is it?

39
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,060
- No, Your Grace.
- No?

40
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,520
You don't like the Hand's joke?

41
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,940
You're torturing the poor boy.

42
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,730
You heard the Hand.
The king's too fat for his armor.

43
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,780
Go find the breastplate
stretcher - now!

44
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:50,120
"The breastplate stretcher"?

45
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,370
How long before he figures it out?

46
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,620
- Maybe you should have one invented.
- All right, all right.

47
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,710
You watch me out there.
I still know how to point a lance.

48
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,460
You've no business jousting.
Leave that for the young men.

49
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:04,920
Why, because I'm king?
Piss on that. I want to hit somebody!

50
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:07,180
- And who's going to hit you back?
- Anybody who can.

51
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,180
- And the last man in his saddle...
- Will be you.

52
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:14,730
There's not a man in the Seven Kingdoms
would risk hurting you.

53
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:17,140
Are you telling me
those cowards would let me win?

54
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,940
Aye.

55
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,780
- Drink.
- I'm not thirsty.

56
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,240
Drink. Your king commands it.

57
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,040
Gods,

58
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,620
too fat for my armor.

59
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:41,170
Your squire -
a Lannister boy?

60
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:43,750
Mm. A bloody idiot,

61
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,840
but Cersei insisted.

62
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,340
I have Jon Arryn to thank for her.

63
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:52,350
"Cersei Lannister will make
a good match," he told me.

64
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:55,140
"You'll need her father on your side. "

65
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:01,110
I thought being king
meant I could do whatever I wanted.

66
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:06,240
Enough of this.
Let's go watch 'em ride.

67
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,030
At least I can smell
someone else's blood.

68
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,160
- Robert.
- What?

69
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:14,870
Oh.

70
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,580
An inspiring sight for the people, eh?

71
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,540
Come, bow before your king!
Bow, you shits!

72
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,560
- Where's Arya?
- At her dancing lessons.

73
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,060
The Knight of the Flowers.

74
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:51,160
Thank you, Ser Loras.

75
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:24,940
Don't let Ser Gregor hurt him.

76
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,690
- Hey.
- I can't watch.

77
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:32,780
A hundred gold dragons on the Mountain.

78
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:36,620
- I'll take that bet.
- Now what will I buy with 100 gold dragons?

79
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,740
A dozen barrels of Dornish wine?

80
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:41,910
Or a girl from
the pleasure houses of Lys?

81
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,920
- Or you could even buy a friend.
- He's going to die.

82
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,880
Ser Loras rides well.

83
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,160
Such a shame, Littlefinger.

84
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:23,500
It would have been so nice
for you to have a friend.

85
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,500
And tell me, Lord Renly,

86
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,960
when will you be having your friend?

87
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,220
Loras knew his mare was in heat.
Quite crafty, really.

88
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,640
Ser Loras would never do that.

89
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:48,690
- There's no honor in tricks.
- No honor and quite a bit of gold.

90
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,900
Sword!

91
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:20,550
Leave him be!

92
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,700
Stop this madness
in the name of your king!

93
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,920
Let him go!

94
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,600
I owe you my life, ser.

95
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,890
I'm no ser.

96
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,080
Remove his hood.

97
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:34,300
♪ On that eve, the captive Imp

98
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:37,970
♪ Downwards from his horse did limp

99
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:41,140
♪ No more would he preen and primp

100
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,890
♪ In garb of red and gold ♪

101
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,600
This isn't the Kingsroad.

102
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,560
- You said we were riding for Winterfell.
- I did... Often and loudly.

103
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:52,230
Very wise.
They'll be out in droves,

104
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,360
looking for me in the wrong place.

105
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,440
Word's probably gotten
to my father by now.

106
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:00,070
He'll be offering a handsome reward.

107
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,320
Everyone knows
a Lannister always pays his debts.

108
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:05,830
Would you be so good as to untie me?

109
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:09,250
- And why would I do that?
- Why not?

110
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:12,750
Am I going to run?
The hill tribes would kill me for my boots.

111
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,460
Unless a shadowcat ate me first.

112
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:17,550
Shadowcats and hill tribes
are the least of your concerns.

113
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:22,300
Ah, the eastern road.

114
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,350
We're going to the Vale.

115
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:28,140
You're taking me to your sister's
to answer for my imagined crimes.

116
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:32,230
Tell me, Lady Stark,
when was the last time you saw your sister?

117
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,980
- Five years ago.
- She's changed.

118
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:39,690
She was always a bit touched, but now...
You might as well kill me here.

119
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,990
- I am not a murderer, Lannister.
- Neither am I.

120
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:45,450
I had nothing to do
with the attempt on your son's life.

121
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,370
- The dagger found...
- What sort of imbecile

122
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:49,200
arms an assassin with his own blade?

123
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:51,410
- Should I gag him?
- Why?

124
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,420
Am I starting to make sense?

125
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:56,340
Rodrik!

126
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:01,840
My lady, this way.

127
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:20,400
Untie me.

128
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:23,450
If I die, what's the point?

129
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,200
Ah!

130
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:17,120
- Rodrik?
- I'll be fine, my lady.

131
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,250
There's no need to bloody yourself.

132
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,590
Your first?

133
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,800
You need a woman.

134
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:29,090
Nothing like a woman after a fight.

135
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,140
I'm willing if she is.

136
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,610
Bran.

137
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:51,490
The Iron Islands.
Sigil - a kraken.

138
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,700
Words - "We do not sow. "

139
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,950
- Lords?
- The Greyjoys.

140
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,370
Famed for their skills at archery,
navigation and lovemaking.

141
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:03,300
And failed rebellions.

142
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:09,680
Sigil - a stag,
a crowned stag now that Robert's king.

143
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,800
- Good.
- Words - "Ours is the fury. "

144
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:15,520
- Lords - the Baratheons.
- Mm-hm.

145
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,520
The Westerlands.

146
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,690
- Sigil - a lion.
- Mmm.

147
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:22,810
- Words - "A Lannister always pays his debts. "
- No.

148
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,360
A common saying,
but not their official motto.

149
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,490
Lords - the Lannisters.

150
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:31,490
- We're still on their words.
- I don't know them.

151
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,530
You do know them. Think.

152
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:36,120
"Unbowed, unbent, unbroken. "

153
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,870
- That's House Martell.
- "Righteous in wrath. "

154
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,500
- House Hornwood.
- "Family, duty, honor. "

155
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:44,550
Those are Tully words -
your mother's.

156
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:48,220
- Are we playing a game?
- Family, duty, honor...

157
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,550
- Is that the right order?
- You know it is.

158
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,680
Family comes first?

159
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:57,020
Your mother had to leave Winterfell
to protect the family.

160
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:59,600
How can she protect the family

161
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:02,020
if she's not with her family?

162
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:05,400
Your mother sat by your bed

163
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:08,240
for three weeks while you slept.

164
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,450
And then she left!

165
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,200
When you were born, I was the one
who pulled you from your mother.

166
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:19,290
I placed you in her arms.

167
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:23,210
From that moment
until the moment she dies,

168
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:26,750
she will love you.

169
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,550
Absolutely.

170
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:32,720
- Fiercely.
- Why did she leave?

171
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,680
I still can't tell you,

172
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,260
- but she will be home soon.
- Do you know where she is now?

173
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,970
Today?

174
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,770
- No, I don't.
- Then how can you promise me

175
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:43,900
she'll be home soon?

176
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:49,320
Sometimes I worry
you're too smart for your own good.

177
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,860
I'll never shoot another arrow.

178
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,370
And where is that written?

179
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:59,080
- You need legs to work a bow.
- Hmm.

180
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,710
If the saddle Lord Tyrion
designed actually works,

181
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:04,250
you could learn
to shoot a bow from horseback.

182
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,080
Really?

183
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:09,670
Dothraki boys learn
when they're four years old.

184
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,800
Why shouldn't you?

185
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,980
Shh, keep it down.

186
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:31,570
You're not supposed to be
inside the castle walls.

187
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:34,950
I thought you were supposed to be
an important person around here.

188
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:37,320
Important enough for the likes of you.

189
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,790
You're not the only nobleman
in my life, you know.

190
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:44,330
Who, the Imp?
I'd call him half a nobleman.

191
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,380
Jealous?

192
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,250
Why should I be jealous?

193
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:51,300
Anyone with a few coppers
in his pocket can own you for the night.

194
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:54,510
What's a dwarf like down below?

195
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,720
I've always wondered.

196
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,930
- Might surprise you.
- Hmm?

197
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:04,140
He's good with his fingers too.
And his tongue.

198
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:07,190
Generous tipper.

199
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:10,020
I guess gold is cheap for a Lannister.

200
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:12,030
You are jealous.

201
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:13,780
I'm a Greyjoy.

202
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,030
We've been lords
of the Iron Islands for 300 years.

203
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,950
There's not a family in Westeros
that can look down on us,

204
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,990
not even the Lannisters.

205
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,120
And what about the Starks?

206
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:27,330
I've been Lord Stark's ward
since I was eight years old.

207
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:30,880
A ward -
that's a nice word for it.

208
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,840
Your father rebelled
against King Robert and if he does it again...

209
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:37,130
My father fought
for the freedom of his people.

210
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:40,890
What did your father do?
Fucked a cook and whelped a whore.

211
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:43,520
You're a very serious boy.

212
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,810
- I'm not a boy.
- Oh, yes, you are.

213
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,820
A serious boy
with a serious cock.

214
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:54,230
I don't want to pay for it.

215
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,030
Then get yourself a wife.

216
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,530
Come on.

217
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:06,160
I'm not gonna hurt you.

218
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,840
How is your son, my lord?

219
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,720
He'll never walk again.

220
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,680
But his mind is sound?

221
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,640
So they say.

222
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:27,890
A blessing, then.

223
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,190
I suffered an early mutilation myself.

224
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,570
Some doors close forever...

225
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,860
others open
in most unexpected places.

226
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,740
May I?

227
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:51,250
If the wrong ears heard
what I'm about to tell you,

228
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,460
off comes my head.

229
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,170
And who would mourn poor Varys then?

230
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:59,930
North or South,
they sing no songs for spiders.

231
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:02,430
But there are things you must know.

232
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:05,930
You are the King's Hand
and the king is a fool -

233
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:10,810
your friend, I know, but a fool -
and doomed unless you save him.

234
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:13,440
I've been in the capital a month.

235
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:17,360
Why have you waited so long
to tell me this?

236
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,240
I didn't trust you.

237
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,700
So why do you trust me now?

238
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:26,620
The queen is not the only one
who has been watching you closely.

239
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,870
There are few men of honor
in the capital.

240
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,710
You are one of them.

241
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:34,750
I would like to believe I am another,
strange as that may seem.

242
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,460
What sort of doom does the king face?

243
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:40,300
The same sort as Jon Arryn.

244
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:44,390
The tears of lys, they call it.

245
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:46,810
A rare and costly thing,

246
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:50,430
as clear and tasteless as water.
It leaves no trace.

247
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,530
Who gave it to him?

248
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:04,700
Some dear friend, no doubt.
But which one?

249
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:09,080
There were many.
Lord Arryn was a kind and trusting man.

250
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,330
There was one boy.

251
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,960
All he was he owed to Jon Arryn.

252
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,040
The squire, Ser Hugh?

253
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:21,090
Pity, what happened to him,

254
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,340
just when his life seemed to be
going so nicely.

255
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:28,560
If Ser Hugh poisoned him...

256
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:32,060
who paid Ser Hugh?

257
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:37,560
- Someone who could afford it.
- Jon was a man of peace.

258
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:41,190
He was Hand for 17 years -
17 good years.

259
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,110
Why kill him?

260
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:47,370
He started asking questions.

261
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:18,690
He's found
one bastard already.

262
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,940
He has the book.

263
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,980
The rest will come.

264
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:25,450
And when he knows the truth,
what will he do?

265
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:27,280
The gods alone know.

266
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:30,410
The fools tried to kill his son.

267
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:33,200
What's worse -
they botched it.

268
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:38,460
The wolf and the lion
will be at each other's throats.

269
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:42,300
- We will be at war soon, my friend.
- What good is war now?

270
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:44,460
We're not ready.

271
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:47,130
If one Hand can die,
why not a second?

272
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,840
This Hand is not the other.

273
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:51,550
We need time.

274
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,810
Khal Drogo will not make his move
until his son is born.

275
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:58,270
- You know what these savages are.
- "Delay," you say.

276
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,360
"Move fast," I reply.

277
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,780
This is no longer
a game for two players.

278
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,900
It never was.

279
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:28,510
The first to arrive
and the last to leave.

280
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:32,140
I admire your industry.

281
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,890
You do move quietly.

282
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,480
We all have our qualities.

283
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:40,560
You look a bit lonely today.

284
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:42,980
You should pay a visit
to my brothel this evening.

285
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:45,570
- First boy is on the house.
- I think you're mistaking

286
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:48,570
- business with pleasure.
- Am I?

287
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,330
All those birds that whisper in your ear -
such pretty little things.

288
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:57,910
Trust me,

289
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,670
we accommodate all inclinations.

290
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:05,800
Oh, I'm sure. Lord Redwyne
likes his boys very young, I hear.

291
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:10,720
I'm a purveyor of beauty and discretion -
both equally important.

292
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:15,470
Though I suppose beauty
is a subjective quality, no?

293
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:20,060
Is it true that Ser Marlon of Tumblestone
prefers amputees?

294
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:22,900
All desires are valid
to a man with a full purse.

295
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:26,400
And I heard the most awful rumor
about a certain lord

296
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,530
with a taste for fresh cadavers.

297
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,860
Must be enormously difficult
to accommodate that inclination.

298
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:34,910
The logistics alone...

299
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:38,240
to find beautiful corpses
before they rot.

300
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:42,460
Strictly speaking, such a thing would not be
in accordance with the king's laws.

301
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:45,000
Strictly speaking.

302
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:52,720
Tell me. Does someone somewhere
keep your balls in a little box?

303
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:56,220
I've often wondered.

304
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,430
Do you know,
I have no idea where they are.

305
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:03,270
And we had been so close.

306
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,110
But enough about me.
How have you been

307
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:07,270
since we last saw each other?

308
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,940
Since you last saw me
or since I last saw you?

309
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:13,400
Now the last time I saw you,
you were talking to the Hand of the King.

310
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:16,280
- Saw me with your own eyes?
- Eyes I own.

311
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:17,950
Council business.

312
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,080
We all have so much
to discuss with Ned Stark.

313
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:26,170
Everyone's well aware of
your enduring fondness for Lord Stark's wife.

314
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:30,670
If the Lannisters were behind the attempt
on the Stark boy's life

315
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:36,140
and it was discovered that you helped
the Starks come to that conclusion...

316
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:39,260
to think a simple word to the queen...

317
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:41,640
- One shudders at the thought.
- Ooh.

318
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:44,230
But you know something?
I do believe that I have seen you

319
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:46,270
even more recently
than you have seen me.

320
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,150
- Have you?
- Yes.

321
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,980
Earlier today, I distinctly recall

322
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:53,490
seeing you talking
to Lord Stark in his chambers.

323
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:55,740
Was that you under the bed?

324
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:57,780
And not long after that

325
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:00,540
when I saw you escorting a certain

326
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,710
foreign dignitary...

327
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:06,210
Council business?

328
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:09,500
Of course, you would have friends
from across the Narrow Sea.

329
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:12,210
You're from there yourself, after all.

330
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:15,470
We're friends, aren't we, Lord Varys?

331
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:17,800
I'd like to think we are.

332
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:20,140
So you can imagine my burden,

333
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:23,890
wondering if the king
might question my friend's sympathies.

334
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:27,980
To stand at a crossroads
where turning left means loyalty to a friend,

335
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,900
turning right loyalty to the realm...

336
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:32,360
- Oh, please.
- To find myself in a position

337
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,400
where a simple word to the king...

338
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:36,610
What are you two conspiring about?

339
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,030
Well, whatever it is,
you'd best hurry up.

340
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:43,200
- My brother is coming.
- To a small council meeting?

341
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:46,210
Disturbing news from far away.

342
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:49,830
Hadn't you heard?

343
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:20,870
Off with you. No begging.

344
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:22,870
I'm not a beggar.
I live here.

345
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:25,120
D'you want a smack on your ear
to help you with your hearing?

346
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,080
I want to see my father.

347
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,920
I want to fuck the queen,
for all the good it does me.

348
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,750
You want your father, boy?

349
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:35,960
He's lying on the floor of some tavern,
getting pissed on by his friends.

350
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:38,550
My father is Hand of the King!

351
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,180
I'm not a boy.
I'm Arya Stark of Winterfell.

352
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:44,680
And if you lay a hand on me, my father
will have both your heads on spikes.

353
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:47,770
Now are you going to let me by
or do I need to smack you

354
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:50,400
on the ear to help with your hearing?

355
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:55,020
You know I had half my guard
out searching for you?

356
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:01,740
- You promised me this would stop.
- They said they were going to kill you.

357
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:04,530
- Who did?
- I didn't see them,

358
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,450
- but I think one was fat.
- Oh, Arya.

359
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:09,160
I'm not lying!
They said you found the bastard

360
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:12,170
and the wolves are fighting
the lions and the savage...

361
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:14,000
Something about the savage.

362
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:16,460
- Where did you hear this?
- In the dungeons,

363
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:19,760
- near the dragon skulls.
- What were you doing in the dungeons?

364
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,970
Chasing a cat.

365
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,810
Pardon, my lord.

366
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:30,180
There's a night's watchman here
begging a word. Says it's urgent.

367
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,110
- Your name, friend?
- Yoren, if it please.

368
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:44,280
- This must be your son. He has the look.
- I'm a girl!

369
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:45,990
Did Benjen send you?

370
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:50,120
No one sent me, my lord.
I'm here to find men for the Wall,

371
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:53,790
see if there's any scum in the dungeons
that might be fit for service.

372
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,540
- Oh, we'll find recruits for you.
- Thank you, my lord.

373
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:58,960
But that's not why I disturb you now.

374
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,090
Your brother Benjen,
his blood runs black -

375
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,260
makes him as much
my brother as yours.

376
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:10,810
It's for his sake I rode here so hard
I damn near killed my horse.

377
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:12,600
There are others riding too.

378
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:15,190
The whole city will know by tomorrow.

379
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:17,690
Know what?

380
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:20,320
Best said in private, my lord.

381
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:28,990
Go on. We'll talk more later.

382
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:32,080
Jory, take her safely to her room.

383
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,670
Come along, my lady.
You heard your father.

384
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:45,430
- How many guards does my father have?
- Here in King's Landing? Fifty.

385
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:48,140
You wouldn't let anyone
kill him, would you?

386
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,970
No fear on that count, little lady.

387
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:59,070
- Well?
- It's about your wife, my lord.

388
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:03,190
She's taken the Imp.

389
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,250
You're far from home, Lady Stark.

390
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:25,930
- To whom do I speak?
- Ser Vardis Egan, knight of the Vale.

391
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:30,180
- Is Lady Arryn expecting your visit?
- There was no time to send word.

392
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,470
May I ask, my lady,

393
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,390
why he is with you?

394
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,150
That's why there was no time.

395
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:39,940
- He is my prisoner.
- He doesn't look like a prisoner.

396
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:43,230
My sister will decide what he looks like.

397
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:47,030
Yes, my lady.
She will at that.

398
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:56,460
The Eyrie.
They say it's impregnable.

399
00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:00,210
Give me ten good men
and some climbing spikes,

400
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,550
I'll impregnate the bitch.

401
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:05,380
I like you.

402
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,230
Lord Stark, your presence
has been requested

403
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:19,650
in the small council chamber.
A meeting has been called.

404
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:21,860
I need to see the king first - alone.

405
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:24,230
The king is at
the small council meeting, my lord.

406
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,320
He has summoned you.

407
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:29,320
- Is it about my wife?
- No, my lord.

408
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:32,120
I believe it concerns Daenerys Targaryen.

409
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,500
- The whore is pregnant.
- You're speaking of murdering a child.

410
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:39,040
I warned you this would happen,
back in the North.

411
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,750
I warned you, but you didn't care to hear.

412
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,130
Well, hear it now.

413
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:47,670
I want 'em dead,
mother and child both.

414
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,840
And that fool Viserys as well.

415
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:53,350
Is that plain enough for you?
I want them both dead.

416
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:56,020
You will dishonor yourself
forever if you do this.

417
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:59,690
Honor?!
I've got seven kingdoms to rule!

418
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:02,900
One king, seven kingdoms.

419
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:05,270
Do you think honor keeps them in line?

420
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,490
Do you think it's honor
that's keeping the peace?

421
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:11,990
- It's fear - fear and blood.
- Then we're no better than the Mad King.

422
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:16,370
- Careful, Ned. Careful now.
- You want to assassinate a girl

423
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,080
because the spider heard a rumor?

424
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:20,960
No rumor, my lord.
The princess is with child.

425
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:24,380
- Based on whose information?
- Ser Jorah Mormont.

426
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,710
He is serving as advisor
to the Targaryens.

427
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,260
Mormont?
You bring us the whispers

428
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:32,930
of a traitor half a world away
and call it fact?

429
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:35,720
Jorah Mormont's a slaver,
not a traitor.

430
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:38,220
Small difference, I know,
to an honorable man.

431
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:41,980
He broke the law,
betrayed his family, fled our land.

432
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,150
We commit murder
on the word of this man?

433
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:47,860
And if he's right?
If she has a son?

434
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:51,280
A Targaryen at the head
of a Dothraki army -

435
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:55,240
- what then?
- The Narrow Sea still lies between us.

436
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:59,450
I'll fear the Dothraki the day they teach
their horses to run on water.

437
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,500
Do nothing?

438
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,920
That's your wise advice?

439
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:07,590
Do nothing till our enemies
are on our shores?

440
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:09,800
You're my council.
Counsel!

441
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:13,590
Speak sense to this honorable fool.

442
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:17,600
I understand your misgivings, my lord.

443
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,310
Truly, I do.
It is a terrible thing

444
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:22,440
we must consider, a vile thing.

445
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,770
Yet we who presume to rule

446
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,940
must sometimes do vile things

447
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,280
for the good of the realm.

448
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,740
Should the gods
grant Daenerys a son,

449
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:36,700
- the realm will bleed.
- I bear this girl no ill will,

450
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:40,620
but should the Dothraki invade,
how many innocents will die?

451
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:43,080
How many towns will burn?

452
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:46,460
Is it not wiser, kinder even,

453
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:51,760
that she should die now
so that tens of thousands might live?

454
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,470
We should have had them
both killed years ago.

455
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:56,800
When you find yourself
in bed with an ugly woman,

456
00:32:56,930 --> 00:33:00,180
best close your eyes,
get it over with.

457
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:03,430
Cut her throat.
Be done with it.

458
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:12,490
I followed you into war -

459
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:14,610
twice,

460
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:16,530
without doubts,

461
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,660
without second thoughts.

462
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:21,580
But I will not follow you now.

463
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,580
The Robert I grew up with

464
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:28,130
didn't tremble at the shadow
of an unborn child.

465
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:32,000
She dies.

466
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,340
I will have no part in it.

467
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:37,680
You're the King's Hand, Lord Stark.

468
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:41,260
You'll do as I command
or I'll find me a Hand who will.

469
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:52,440
And good luck to him.

470
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:56,320
- I thought you were a better man.
- Out. Out, damn you.

471
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:58,110
I'm done with you.

472
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:02,280
Go, run back to Winterfell!

473
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:04,750
I'll have your head on a spike!

474
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:09,040
I'll put it there myself, you fool!

475
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:11,040
You think you're too good for this?

476
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:14,090
Too proud and honorable?
This is a war!

477
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:20,050
I'll go ahead with my daughters.
Get them ready. Do it yourself.

478
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:22,970
- Don't ask anyone for help.
- Right away, my lord.

479
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,640
Lord Baelish is here for you.

480
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:29,310
His Grace went on about you
at some length

481
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:33,270
after you took your leave.
The word "treason" was mentioned.

482
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:38,150
- What can I do for you?
- When do you return to Winterfell?

483
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:41,160
- Why? What do you care?
- If you're still here come nightfall,

484
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,950
I'll take you to see the last person
Jon Arryn spoke with before falling ill.

485
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,540
If that sort of thing still interests you.

486
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:50,250
I don't have the time.

487
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:53,420
It won't take more than an hour.
But as you please.

488
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:02,050
Round up all the men we have
and station them outside the girls' chambers.

489
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:05,640
- Who are your best two swords?
- Heward and Wyl.

490
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:08,890
Find them and meet me at the stables.

491
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:16,320
You bring him here without permission?

492
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:19,240
You pollute my home with his presence?

493
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,700
Your aunt has done a bad thing,
Robin, a very bad thing.

494
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:28,330
You remember her, don't you?

495
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,710
Isn't he beautiful?

496
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:34,840
And strong too. Jon knew it.

497
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,800
His last words were
"The seed is strong. "

498
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,380
He wanted everyone to know
what a good, strong boy

499
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:43,010
his son would grow up to be.

500
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:46,260
Look at him,
the lord of all the Vale.

501
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:48,640
Lysa,

502
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:51,140
you wrote me about the Lannisters,

503
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:54,270
- warning me...
- To stay away from them!

504
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,980
Not to bring one here!

505
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:59,360
Mummy...

506
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:02,490
- is that the bad man?
- It is.

507
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:06,950
He's little.

508
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,200
He's Tyrion the Imp,
of House Lannister.

509
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,250
He killed your father.
He murdered the Hand of the King!

510
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,840
Oh, did I kill him too?

511
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:20,090
- I've been a very busy man.
- You will watch your tongue!

512
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:23,010
These men are knights of the Vale.

513
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:25,760
Every one of them loved Jon Arryn.

514
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:27,810
Every one of them would die for me.

515
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:31,350
If any harm comes to me,
my brother Jaime will see that they do.

516
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,350
You can't hurt us.
No one can hurt us here. Tell him, Mummy!

517
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,270
- Tell him!
- Shh-shh-shh-shh-shh, my sweet boy.

518
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:42,820
He's just trying to frighten us.
Lannisters are all liars.

519
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:45,660
No one will hurt my baby.

520
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,450
Mummy...

521
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:51,000
I want to see the bad man fly.

522
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:56,420
- Perhaps you will, my little love.
- This man is my prisoner.

523
00:36:57,130 --> 00:36:59,960
I will not have him harmed.

524
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,090
Ser Vardis,

525
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,970
my sister's guest is weary.

526
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,680
Take him down below
so he can rest.

527
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,680
Introduce him to Mord.

528
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:16,600
You go sleep, dwarf man.

529
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:18,770
Sleep good, little dwarf man!

530
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,940
Lord Stark's lucky he still has a head.

531
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:59,690
Robert will rant for a few days,
but he won't do anything.

532
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:02,900
- He adores the man.
- You're jealous.

533
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:06,610
- Are you sure this won't hurt?
- Only if I slip.

534
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:14,040
- And you'd prefer me like this?
- Mm-hm.

535
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,620
If you want hairless,
maybe you should find a little boy.

536
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:18,750
I want you.

537
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:22,920
My brother thinks that anyone
who hasn't been to war isn't a man.

538
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:25,460
He treats me as if I'm a spoilt child.

539
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:28,760
Oh, and you're not?

540
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,970
Loras Tyrell,
the Knight of the Flowers?

541
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,260
How many wars have you fought in?

542
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:37,640
Oh, and how much did your father spend
on that armor of yours?

543
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:39,600
Hold still.

544
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:43,650
All I ever hear from Robert and Stannis
is how I'm not tough enough,

545
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,530
how I squirm at the sight of blood.

546
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:48,280
You did vomit when that boy's eye
was knocked out in the melee.

547
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:50,320
His eye was dangling
out of the damn socket!

548
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:53,030
He shouldn't have entered the melee
if he didn't know how to fight.

549
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:56,330
Easy for you to say.
Not everyone is such a gifted swordsman.

550
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:58,870
It's not a gift.
No one gave it to me.

551
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,830
I'm good because I work at it -

552
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,710
every day of my life
since I could hold a stick.

553
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:07,880
I could work at fighting all day, every day,
I'd still never be as good as you.

554
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:10,430
Yes, well, I guess we'll never know.

555
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,940
- Everywhere?
- Everywhere.

556
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:25,320
So how did it end up?

557
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:30,490
- The Targaryen girl will die?
- It needs to be done, unpleasant as it is.

558
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:32,610
Robert's rather tasteless about it.

559
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:36,240
Every time he talks about killing her,
I swear the table rises six inches.

560
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:39,200
It's a shame he can't muster
the same enthusiasm for his wife.

561
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:41,710
He does have a deep,
abiding lust for her money.

562
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:44,210
You have to give it
to the Lannisters - they may be

563
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:47,590
the most pompous, ponderous cunts
the gods ever suffered to walk the world,

564
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:50,340
but they do have
outrageous amounts of money.

565
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:55,640
- I have an outrageous amount of money.
- Not as much as the Lannisters.

566
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,140
But a lot more than you.

567
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:02,560
Robert's threatening
to take me hunting with him.

568
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:04,690
Last time we were out there
for two weeks.

569
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:07,230
Tramping through the trees
in the rain, day after day,

570
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:10,400
all so he can stick his spear
into something's flesh.

571
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:13,860
Oh. But Robert loves his killing.

572
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:15,910
- And he's the king.
- Hmm.

573
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:19,540
- How did that ever happen?
- Because he loves his killing.

574
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,710
And he used to be good at it.

575
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:25,040
Do you know who should be king?

576
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,420
- Be serious.
- I am.

577
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,710
My father could be your bank.

578
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,760
I've never fought in a war before,

579
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,590
- but I'd fight for you.
- I'm fourth in line.

580
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,720
And where's Robert
in the line of royal succession?

581
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:40,100
Joffrey is a monster.
Tommen is eight.

582
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:42,770
- Stannis?
- Stannis has the personality of a lobster.

583
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:44,980
He's still my older brother.

584
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,520
- What are you doing?!
- Look at it.

585
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:49,780
- You cut me.
- It's just blood. We've all got it in us.

586
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:52,190
Sometimes a little spills.

587
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:55,490
If you become king,
you're going to see a lot of this.

588
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,780
You need to get used to it.

589
00:40:57,910 --> 00:40:59,910
Go on. Look.

590
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:04,040
People love you.

591
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:07,540
They love to serve you
because you're kind to them.

592
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:10,130
They want to be near you.

593
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:15,180
You're willing to do
what needs to be done,

594
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:18,470
but you don't gloat over it.

595
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,350
You don't love killing.

596
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:28,110
Where is it written that power
is the sole province of the worst?

597
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:32,990
That thrones are only made
for the hated and the feared?

598
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:38,530
You would be a wonderful king.

599
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:59,680
I'm sorry your marriage
to Ned Stark didn't work out.

600
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,390
You seemed so good together.

601
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:04,810
I'm glad I could do something
to make you happy.

602
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:10,770
Without a Hand,
everything will fall to pieces.

603
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:15,570
I suppose this is where you tell me
to give the job to your brother Jaime.

604
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,110
No.

605
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,240
He's not serious enough.

606
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:23,370
I'll say this for Ned Stark -
he's serious enough.

607
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:24,540
Hmm.

608
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:28,250
Was it really worth it?
Losing him this way?

609
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:30,210
I don't know.

610
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,460
But I do know this -

611
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:40,720
if the Targaryen girl convinces
her horselord husband to invade

612
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:44,100
and the Dothraki horde
crosses the Narrow Sea...

613
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:47,890
we won't be able to stop them.

614
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:50,350
The Dothraki don't sail.
Every child knows that.

615
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,690
They don't have discipline.
They don't have armor.

616
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:57,280
- They don't have siege weapons.
- It's a neat little trick you do -

617
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:00,410
you move your lips
and your father's voice comes out.

618
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:03,530
Is my father wrong?

619
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:09,920
Let's say Viserys Targaryen lands

620
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:13,630
with 40,000 Dothraki screamers at his back.

621
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:16,090
We hole up in our castles.

622
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:17,920
A wise move -

623
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:21,720
only a fool would meet
the Dothraki in an open field.

624
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:24,640
They leave us in our castles.

625
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:28,230
They go from town to town,
looting and burning,

626
00:43:28,350 --> 00:43:32,100
killing every man
who can't hide behind a stone wall,

627
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:34,730
stealing all our crops and livestock,

628
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:37,730
enslaving all our women and children.

629
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:40,280
How long do the people
of the Seven Kingdoms stand behind

630
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:43,660
their absentee king,
their cowardly king

631
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:46,200
hiding behind high walls?

632
00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:49,120
When do the people decide
that Viserys Targaryen

633
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:51,620
is the rightful monarch after all?

634
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:55,420
We still outnumber them.

635
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,090
Which is the bigger number -
five or one?

636
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:02,590
Five.

637
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,470
Five...

638
00:44:07,350 --> 00:44:09,390
One.

639
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,690
One army - a real army

640
00:44:11,810 --> 00:44:15,650
united behind one leader
with one purpose.

641
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:21,450
Our purpose died with the Mad King.

642
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:23,700
Now we've got as many armies

643
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:27,700
as there are men
with gold in their purse.

644
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:29,790
And everybody wants
something different.

645
00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:32,120
Your father wants to own the world.

646
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:35,500
Ned Stark wants to run away
and bury his head in the snow.

647
00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:37,630
What do you want?

648
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:51,270
We haven't had
a real fight in nine years.

649
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:53,480
Backstabbing doesn't prepare you
for a fight.

650
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,650
And that's all the realm is now -

651
00:44:55,770 --> 00:44:57,860
backstabbing and scheming

652
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:00,980
and arse-licking
and money-grubbing.

653
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:04,780
Sometimes I don't know
what holds it together.

654
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:08,910
Our marriage.

655
00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:19,670
Ah, so here we sit,

656
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:24,510
17 years later,
holding it all together.

657
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:28,100
Don't you get tired?

658
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:30,680
Every day.

659
00:45:31,970 --> 00:45:34,890
How long can hate
hold a thing together?

660
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:38,980
Well, 17 years is quite a long time.

661
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:43,990
Yes, it is.

662
00:45:49,490 --> 00:45:51,950
What was she like?

663
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,160
You've never asked
about her, not once.

664
00:45:56,290 --> 00:45:57,750
Why not?

665
00:45:58,710 --> 00:46:02,420
At first, just saying her name
even in private

666
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:05,670
felt like I was breathing life
back into her.

667
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:10,600
I thought if I didn't talk about her,
she'd just fade away for you.

668
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,560
When I realized
that wasn't going to happen,

669
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,680
I refused to ask out of spite.

670
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:21,360
I didn't want to give you the satisfaction
of thinking I cared enough to ask.

671
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:24,730
And eventually it became clear
that my spite didn't mean anything to you.

672
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:27,740
As far as I could tell,
you actually enjoyed it.

673
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,820
So why now?

674
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:35,950
What harm could Lyanna Stark's ghost
do to either of us

675
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:39,210
that we haven't done to each other
a hundred times over?

676
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:45,090
You want to know the horrible truth?

677
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:50,340
I can't even remember
what she looked like.

678
00:46:53,930 --> 00:46:58,600
I only know she was
the one thing I ever wanted.

679
00:47:00,770 --> 00:47:03,110
Someone took her away from me,

680
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:08,530
and seven kingdoms
couldn't fill the hole she left behind.

681
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:14,950
I felt something
for you once, you know?

682
00:47:16,290 --> 00:47:18,040
I know.

683
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:20,920
Even after we lost our first boy.

684
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:24,790
For quite a while, actually.

685
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:33,550
Was it ever possible for us?
Was there ever a time, ever a moment?

686
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:41,940
No.

687
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,490
Does that make you feel better or worse?

688
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:56,280
It doesn't make me feel anything.

689
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:12,760
She looks like him,

690
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:14,800
don't she, my lord?

691
00:48:14,930 --> 00:48:17,850
She has his nose,
his black hair.

692
00:48:18,850 --> 00:48:20,390
Aye.

693
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:22,480
Tell him when you see him, my lord.

694
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:26,860
If it please you,
tell him how beautiful she is.

695
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:32,150
- I will.
- And tell him I've been with no one else.

696
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:35,700
I swear it, my lord,
by the old gods and new.

697
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:37,910
I don't want no jewels or nothing,

698
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,740
just him.

699
00:48:39,870 --> 00:48:41,450
The king was always good to me.

700
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:43,710
When Jon Arryn came to visit you,

701
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:47,960
- what did he want?
- He wasn't that sort of man, my lord.

702
00:48:48,090 --> 00:48:50,880
He just wanted to know
if the child was happy,

703
00:48:51,010 --> 00:48:53,010
healthy.

704
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:57,850
Looks healthy enough to me.

705
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:01,890
The girl shall want for nothing.

706
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:10,400
Brothels make a much better
investment than ships,

707
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:12,110
I've found.

708
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,570
Whores rarely sink.

709
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:21,700
What do you know
of King Robert's bastards?

710
00:49:21,830 --> 00:49:25,250
Well, he has more than you, for a start.

711
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,960
- How many?
- Does it matter?

712
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:30,920
If you fuck enough women,
some of them will give you presents.

713
00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:32,960
And Jon Arryn
tracked them all down. Why?

714
00:49:33,090 --> 00:49:35,970
He was the King's Hand.
Perhaps Robert wanted them looked after.

715
00:49:36,090 --> 00:49:39,220
He was overcome with fatherly love.

716
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:43,770
Come.

717
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:52,150
- Jory!
- My lord.

718
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:13,210
Such a small pack of wolves.

719
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,130
Stay back, ser.
This is the Hand of the King.

720
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:19,180
Was the Hand of the King.

721
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:23,220
Now I'm not sure what he is -
lord of somewhere very far away.

722
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,520
What's the meaning of this, Lannister?

723
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:29,850
Get back inside where it's safe.
I'm looking for my brother.

724
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:31,690
You remember my brother,
don't you, Lord Stark?

725
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:35,900
Blond hair,
sharp tongue, short man.

726
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:40,200
- I remember him well.
- It seems he had some trouble on the road.

727
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:43,120
You wouldn't know
what happened to him, would you?

728
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:47,540
He was taken at my command
to answer for his crimes.

729
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:50,210
My lords!

730
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:52,840
I'll bring the City Watch.

731
00:50:54,670 --> 00:50:58,260
Come, Stark.
I'd rather you die sword in hand.

732
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:00,340
- If you threaten my lord again...
- Threaten?

733
00:51:00,470 --> 00:51:03,390
As in, "I'm going to open your lord

734
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:07,100
"from balls to brains
and see what Starks are made of"?

735
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:10,060
You kill me,

736
00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:12,650
your brother's a dead man.

737
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:14,480
You're right.

738
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:17,320
Take him alive. Kill his men.

739
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,600
Yah!

740
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:56,080
My brother, Lord Stark -
we want him back.
