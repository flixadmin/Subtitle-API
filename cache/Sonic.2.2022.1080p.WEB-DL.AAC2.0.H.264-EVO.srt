I was just calling
to say we're here.

317
00:19:14,075 --> 00:19:16,878
<i>But now every word out</i>
<i>of your mouth</i>

318
00:19:17,011 --> 00:19:21,648
What?
You got to relax, buddy.
You're at the Four Seasons Oahu.

319
00:19:21,782 --> 00:19:24,052
Have a mai tai.
Enjoy some time with your wife.

320
00:19:24,185 --> 00:19:26,187
Get sunburned
somewhere embarrassing.

321
00:19:26,321 --> 00:19:28,588
<i>This weekend is about you.</i>

322
00:19:28,722 --> 00:19:31,326
You know what? You're right.
We power-bumped on it.

323
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:32,894
So whatever it is
you're doing,

324
00:19:33,027 --> 00:19:35,196
I'm sure you can undo it
by the time we get home, yeah?

325
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:39,968
<i>Exactly! I mean,</i>
<i>I am deeply offended</i>
<i>by such accusations!</i>

326
00:19:40,101 --> 00:19:41,903
<i>So, how's Rachel's fiancé?</i>

327
00:19:42,036 --> 00:19:44,405
<i>Is he as good-looking</i>
<i>in person as he is</i>
<i>in pictures?</i>

328
00:19:44,538 --> 00:19:46,473
Hey, baby.

329
00:19:46,606 --> 00:19:48,508
[sighs]
Somehow better-looking.

330

[Sonic] <i>Wow! You're about to be</i>

332
00:19:53,448 --> 00:19:54,715
Ha-ha-ha.

333
00:19:54,849 --> 00:19:57,617
All right,
I better go
and introduce myself.

334
00:19:57,751 --> 00:19:59,153
<i>Stay out of trouble.</i>

335
00:19:59,287 --> 00:20:00,754
Trouble?
Don't worry.

00:20:00,888 --> 00:20:03,590
Everything here
is completely normal.

Uh-huh. Night, bud.

338
00:20:06,094 --> 00:20:07,895
Hey! I was just
coming over to say hi.

339
00:20:08,029 --> 00:20:09,730
You've got a lot
of nerve coming up in here

340
00:20:09,864 --> 00:20:12,266
after what you did
to my fiancée.

341
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,168
Wait. What?
Totaling her car?

342
00:20:14,302 --> 00:20:15,669
Leaving her tied
to a chair?

343
00:20:15,803 --> 00:20:17,305
I should rip you
limb from limb.

Oh, my God,
look at your face!

347
00:20:23,177 --> 00:20:25,046
Tommy, breathe, baby.
Breathe. I was kidding.

348
00:20:25,179 --> 00:20:27,547
Hey, man,
I was totally kidding.
Okay.

349
00:20:29,017 --> 00:20:30,717
You were kidding.
Yeah.

350
00:20:30,852 --> 00:20:32,286
I'm sorry.
Rachel put me up to it.

351
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,222
It was totally her idea.

352
00:20:34,355 --> 00:20:35,589
That rascal.

353
00:20:35,722 --> 00:20:37,492
Listen, I don't know
if you're aware.

354
00:20:38,226 --> 00:20:40,527
Rachel does not care
for you at all.

355
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,795
Oh, I'm aware. Yeah.

356

Great to see you, too.
Congratulations.

Ah.

wondering why.

The Master Emerald?

How very responsible of you.

to be two wedding rings?

No. Buddies.
Wingmen. A squad.

Sonic doesn't have
anything like that.
He's flying solo.

Baby, you got to relax.

You're at

Spend some time
with your wife.

That's what he said.
Seriously, his exact words.

See?
He's a smart kid.
All right.

Hmm.
He'll find his way.

No, no, no.
There's a light up ahead.

Ah. Perfect.

We don't know who's inside.

to be a weapon?

I don't know,
but we gonna find out.

Haven't you caused
enough trouble for one day?

No. Right.

1289
01:09:59,519 --> 01:10:01,923
Be honest. How bad is it?

1290
01:10:02,056 --> 01:10:05,592
Not bad at all.
You got Tased. You'll be fine.

I didn't think
that I was even capable
of real happiness.

But that all changed
when you walked
into my life.

And I ended up breaking
the first rule
of undercover work.

How'd you get past
the guards?

1307
01:11:08,722 --> 01:11:10,525
Because that little fox
is into some crazy stuff.

they could hide this.

A big problem.

The compass led Robotnik
to the Emerald.

That's got to be
hundreds of miles away.

All right.

1326

Huddle up.
Let's figure out a plan.

Together.

There's no time for that.

I'm the only one
that can get there fast enough.

1330
01:13:06,607 --> 01:13:09,143
Sonic, this is way too big
for you to do by yourself.

1331
01:13:09,277 --> 01:13:11,212
You see that little fox
over there?

1332
01:13:11,345 --> 01:13:14,882
He came all the way
across the universe
to meet his hero.

1333
01:13:15,016 --> 01:13:18,186
And what did his hero do?
I practically got him killed.

1334
01:13:18,853 --> 01:13:21,122
You know what?
You were right.

1335
01:13:21,255 --> 01:13:23,558
My moment came
and I blew it.

1336
01:13:23,690 --> 01:13:24,859
I'm no hero.

1337
01:13:24,992 --> 01:13:26,160
Wait.
[Sonic] No.

1338
01:13:26,294 --> 01:13:27,662
I'm not letting
anyone else get hurt

1339
01:13:27,794 --> 01:13:28,930
because of me.

1340

Why must you

Because my destiny

I'm sorry.
That just hit me funny.

It's about taking responsibility

01:30:36,691 --> 01:30:38,593
And I'll do it again
if you mess with Green Hills.

1592
01:30:38,725 --> 01:30:43,497
Congratulations
on your oh-so-temporary
sense of superiority.

1593
01:30:43,631 --> 01:30:46,033
You're finished, Robotnik!
We've taken everything.

1594
01:30:46,167 --> 01:30:48,669
Your lab, your drones,
your funding!

1595
01:30:48,803 --> 01:30:52,373
Let's see how big of a man
you are without
your silly little robots.

1596
01:30:53,941 --> 01:30:56,110
Would you like to see how...

1597
01:30:57,445 --> 01:30:59,779
big a man I can be?

1598
01:31:10,458 --> 01:31:13,828
Welcome to the new norm.

1599
01:31:23,838 --> 01:31:25,373
My God!

1600
01:31:28,743 --> 01:31:32,546
Doctor! Take me with you!

He's taking everything apart.

1604
01:31:59,740 --> 01:32:01,309
He's building something.

1605
01:32:09,083 --> 01:32:11,319
[Tails]
That can only be one thing.

1606
01:32:11,452 --> 01:32:13,888
The fearsome power
of the Emerald.

1607
01:32:14,021 --> 01:32:16,324
If that thing really
turns thoughts into power,

1608
01:32:16,457 --> 01:32:18,059
we are in big trouble.

1609
01:32:18,192 --> 01:32:20,061
Robotnik has a lot
of bad thoughts.

1610
01:32:20,194 --> 01:32:23,097
Hey, Sonic, are you sure
it was a good idea

1611
01:32:23,230 --> 01:32:24,899
bringing
you-know-who aboard?

1612
01:32:25,032 --> 01:32:28,636
Knuckles isn't really a bad guy.
He's just a little mixed up.

1613
01:32:28,769 --> 01:32:30,271
I am not mixed up!

1614
01:32:30,404 --> 01:32:33,708
I have steely focus.
And I'm complex.

1615
01:32:33,841 --> 01:32:35,443
And that's a lot
for some people.

1616
01:32:35,576 --> 01:32:38,814
[chuckles]
Hope you're not still mad
I hit you with that car.

1617
01:32:38,946 --> 01:32:41,215
Pfft!
I was completely uninjured.

1618
01:32:41,349 --> 01:32:45,019
And my revenge will come
when you least expect it, fox.

1619
01:33:11,245 --> 01:33:12,480
Whoa.

1620
01:33:16,050 --> 01:33:18,652
Sir, you're magnificent!

1621
01:33:18,786 --> 01:33:20,755
Thank you, sycophant.

1622
01:33:20,888 --> 01:33:23,457
Your admiration is inevitable.

1623
01:33:33,467 --> 01:33:34,769
I knew it!

1624
01:33:34,902 --> 01:33:37,538
Just like the Stay Puft
Marshmallow Man.

Fall back! Quick!

How are we supposed
to beat this thing?

1630
01:34:03,564 --> 01:34:04,365
We need a plan.

1631
01:34:04,498 --> 01:34:07,034
Knuckles,
use your strength to--

1632
01:34:07,168 --> 01:34:09,370
Jump off the plane. Wow.

1633
01:34:09,503 --> 01:34:13,574
Okay, this is what
we're gonna do.
Step 1: Light taunting.

1634
01:34:13,707 --> 01:34:15,543
Step 2: I have no idea.

[Sonic]
Nice action figure, Eggman.

1637
01:34:24,718 --> 01:34:28,088
Does it do anything
or just stand there
looking ugly?

1638

Like a blister,
he keeps coming back!

He's on the okay-to-kill list.
Shoot the missiles.
Make a decision.

1640
01:34:37,965 --> 01:34:40,936
I need a moment, sir.
I'm trying to figure out
how to do this.

1641
01:34:41,068 --> 01:34:43,070
Did you even glance
at a manual?

1642
01:34:43,204 --> 01:34:45,473
No!
I'll do it.

1643
01:34:45,606 --> 01:34:46,674
Pardon my lightning.

1644
01:34:46,808 --> 01:34:49,143
You might want
to ground yourself.

Uh-oh.

1646
01:34:52,179 --> 01:34:55,951
I'm gonna pop that thing open
like a can of chili--

It's the Stache Masher.

Oh, great.

1670
01:36:20,167 --> 01:36:23,304
Next thing you know,
there'll be a report about
a hostile work environment.

1671
01:36:25,941 --> 01:36:29,010
Those were our best attacks,
and they did nothing!

1672
01:36:29,143 --> 01:36:31,745
We can't beat Robotnik
as long as he's got
that Emerald.

1673
01:36:31,880 --> 01:36:33,380
He's too powerful.

1674
01:36:33,514 --> 01:36:36,283
Look, we aren't strong enough
to beat Robotnik on our own.

1675
01:36:36,417 --> 01:36:37,551
But there's three of us.

Your strength, your smarts
and my speed.

Together.
That's how we win.

1678
01:36:42,690 --> 01:36:47,394
So we make our stand here
on the field of battle.

As a team.

What? No. No!

the groin is the weakest spot.

So if I go out there
and rile him up...

1698
01:37:39,948 --> 01:37:42,416
He'll focus on only you,
leaving himself open

1699
01:37:42,549 --> 01:37:44,685
to a flanking maneuver
from me and the fox!

I'm the outsmarter-er!

01:40:23,011 --> 01:40:26,114
I didn't outsmart you.
I'm just the distraction.

[Knuckles] Robotnik!

1752
01:40:28,183 --> 01:40:30,919
I am also a hologram.

1753
01:40:31,052 --> 01:40:32,921
Disloyal.

1754
01:40:33,054 --> 01:40:35,957
"Dis" is how I roll.

Where's my Emerald?

1761
01:41:06,520 --> 01:41:08,323
No, no, no, no!

1762
01:41:08,455 --> 01:41:10,959
Computer, auxiliary power.

01:41:18,266 --> 01:41:19,868
[gasps] Oh.

1765
01:41:20,001 --> 01:41:22,904
The Emerald.
It's right there.

1766
01:41:23,037 --> 01:41:25,006
Move, you hunk of junk!

1767
01:41:29,409 --> 01:41:32,947
I have to... [groans]
...reach it.

Come on.

There he is!
Go! Go, go, go!

No!

We got you, Sonic.

1775
01:42:14,022 --> 01:42:15,589
Hold on!

01:42:28,535 --> 01:42:30,972
You guys okay?
[Tom grunts] Yeah.

1778
01:42:32,340 --> 01:42:34,075
Okay.

1779
01:42:38,813 --> 01:42:40,781
I got the Emerald.
We could still defeat him.

1780
01:42:40,915 --> 01:42:44,185
Come on, come on.
How does this thing work?
What do I do?

1781
01:42:44,319 --> 01:42:45,286
[cracking]

1782
01:42:45,420 --> 01:42:47,155
What?

1783
01:42:47,288 --> 01:42:50,091
No. No, no, no!

1784
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:58,132
Look at the happy little family.

1785
01:43:03,805 --> 01:43:06,341
You have to
get away from me.
I'm the one he wants.

1786
01:43:06,473 --> 01:43:07,741
Hey.

1787
01:43:07,875 --> 01:43:09,509
We're not going anywhere.

1788
01:43:09,643 --> 01:43:11,611
We're family.

1789
01:43:14,849 --> 01:43:16,818
And families
stick together...

1790
01:43:19,486 --> 01:43:20,888
no matter what.

1791
01:43:23,757 --> 01:43:25,093
I love you guys.

1792
01:43:25,792 --> 01:43:27,362
We love you too,
Sonic.

[chaos emeralds chiming]

01:43:36,037 --> 01:43:37,637
No!

1795
01:43:39,440 --> 01:43:41,508
I got him!

1796
01:43:41,641 --> 01:43:47,448
I finally got him!
[cackles]

It's over, Eggman.

1803
01:44:40,435 --> 01:44:44,972
[chuckles]
I like the new look.
It works for you.

1804
01:44:45,106 --> 01:44:48,042
What do you say
we just let bygones be bygones?

1805
01:44:48,176 --> 01:44:50,011
I did some things,
you did some things.

1806
01:44:50,144 --> 01:44:52,213
There are good people
on both sides.

1807
01:44:53,747 --> 01:44:57,051
Surely two intelligent beings

1808
01:44:58,618 --> 01:45:00,855
can work these things out!

1809
01:45:07,761 --> 01:45:09,629
[grunts]

01:45:12,632 --> 01:45:13,600
Come on, buddy.

1811
01:45:13,733 --> 01:45:15,136
Get him, Sonic!
Come on.

1812
01:45:15,269 --> 01:45:16,770
Yeah. Come on.

It's like that?

1815
01:45:35,957 --> 01:45:38,625
Okay, we're not friends.

1816
01:45:42,762 --> 01:45:45,199
Later, hater!

1817
01:45:56,477 --> 01:45:58,379
Sonic!
Buddy! [laughs]

1818
01:45:58,513 --> 01:46:00,281
Wait!
You cannot touch him!

1819
01:46:00,414 --> 01:46:03,084
The hedgehog holds
the power of the Emerald.

1820
01:46:03,217 --> 01:46:07,822
I am sorry.
He is no longer
the Sonic you once knew.

1821
01:46:08,256 --> 01:46:09,290
What?

1822
01:46:24,472 --> 01:46:26,407
[sniffs]

1823
01:46:27,674 --> 01:46:28,809
Mmm.

1824
01:46:28,943 --> 01:46:30,945
Oh, you got to try this.

1825
01:46:36,317 --> 01:46:40,021
Okay. He is exactly
the Sonic you once knew.

1826
01:46:41,688 --> 01:46:43,224
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.

1827
01:46:51,566 --> 01:46:53,301
Sonic!
Whoa!

1828
01:46:54,869 --> 01:46:56,770
Bring it in, bud.

1829
01:46:57,905 --> 01:46:59,607
It's good to be back
in blue.

1830
01:46:59,739 --> 01:47:03,344
The golden god thing was fun,
but blue has always been
more my color.

1831
01:47:03,477 --> 01:47:04,579
Looks good on you.

1832
01:47:04,711 --> 01:47:07,148
Sonic, you were
the most powerful hero

1833
01:47:07,281 --> 01:47:10,084
in the universe,
and you let it go.

1834
01:47:10,218 --> 01:47:11,319
Why?

1835
01:47:12,887 --> 01:47:16,224
Because I still have
some growing up to do.

1836
01:47:18,192 --> 01:47:20,561
And I kind of like
being a kid.

1837
01:47:20,695 --> 01:47:22,530
And you're not
just any kid.

1838
01:47:22,663 --> 01:47:24,498
You're our kid.

1839
01:47:24,632 --> 01:47:25,900
That's right.

1840
01:47:26,033 --> 01:47:28,536
Bring it in!
[Tails] Yay. Hugs.

1841
01:47:28,669 --> 01:47:31,973
It's a good thing
we didn't do this before.
You would've blown up.

1842
01:47:39,247 --> 01:47:40,848
[Sonic] Whoa! You fixed it.

1843
01:47:40,982 --> 01:47:44,385
I've spent my whole life
questing for this.

1844
01:47:44,518 --> 01:47:45,686
Now I have it.

1845
01:47:45,820 --> 01:47:47,588
Now we have it.

1846
01:47:47,722 --> 01:47:50,124
What do we do with it?
What next?

1847
01:47:50,258 --> 01:47:52,293
There were once
two orders of heroes

1848
01:47:52,426 --> 01:47:56,464
who protected the galaxy
from those who would use
the Emerald for evil.

1849
01:47:56,597 --> 01:48:00,635
But they have all passed on
to the great battleground
in the sky.

1850
01:48:00,767 --> 01:48:04,272
So we start a new order.
The three of us.

1851
01:48:04,405 --> 01:48:05,772
This is no light task.

1852
01:48:05,906 --> 01:48:10,945
We must make a vow
to use our powers
to keep the universe safe,

1853
01:48:11,612 --> 01:48:13,414
to watch out for each other.

1854
01:48:13,547 --> 01:48:15,249
Our new tribe.

1855
01:48:15,383 --> 01:48:16,417
Oh, I know!

1856
01:48:16,550 --> 01:48:17,784
A power bump!

1857
01:48:17,918 --> 01:48:19,587
Good idea.

1858
01:48:19,720 --> 01:48:23,224
It's an Earth custom.
An unbreakable promise.

1859
01:48:23,357 --> 01:48:25,226
Very well.

1860
01:48:25,826 --> 01:48:28,396
A power bump it is.

1861
01:48:29,497 --> 01:48:31,265
Power bump!

1862
01:48:34,969 --> 01:48:36,704
[Sonic over PA]
It's truly a beautiful day

1863
01:48:36,837 --> 01:48:39,006
for baseball here
in Green Hills.

1864
01:48:39,140 --> 01:48:40,841
An exciting lineup today

1865
01:48:40,975 --> 01:48:44,145
with the debut appearance
of two new players!

1866
01:48:44,278 --> 01:48:48,549
On the mound,
rookie sensation
from across the galaxy,

1867
01:48:48,683 --> 01:48:51,052
Miles "Tails" Prower,

1868
01:48:51,185 --> 01:48:56,424
facing off against
the powerhouse,
Knuckles the Echidna.

1869
01:48:56,557 --> 01:48:59,160
Um, I don't understand.

1870
01:48:59,293 --> 01:49:01,562
Why am I angry
at the enemy ball?

1871
01:49:01,696 --> 01:49:02,863
You're not angry.

1872
01:49:02,997 --> 01:49:04,699
You just want to hit it
as hard as you can

1873
01:49:04,832 --> 01:49:06,033
and then run around the bases.

1874
01:49:06,167 --> 01:49:09,370
But if my quest ends
where I am standing,

1875
01:49:09,503 --> 01:49:10,905
why run at all?

1876
01:49:11,038 --> 01:49:13,974
Ugh. I can't with this guy.
Why do I even try?

1877
01:49:14,108 --> 01:49:16,777
This is just a game.
We're out here having fun.

1878
01:49:16,911 --> 01:49:18,446
Just having some fun.

1879
01:49:18,579 --> 01:49:20,948
Fun. Huh.

1880
01:49:21,082 --> 01:49:23,317
All right!
Give him the heat, Tails!

1881
01:49:23,451 --> 01:49:25,319
Hope you're ready
for my fastball.

1882
01:49:25,453 --> 01:49:27,955
Your fastball
will be dishonored.

1883
01:49:28,089 --> 01:49:30,424
And so will you, fox.
[grunts]

1884
01:49:30,558 --> 01:49:31,592
Easy, guys!

1885
01:49:31,726 --> 01:49:32,960
Don't think about it too much.

1886
01:49:33,094 --> 01:49:34,995
Just keep your elbow up,
eye on the ball

1887
01:49:35,129 --> 01:49:36,397
and give it a ride.

1888
01:49:36,530 --> 01:49:38,099
A ride? To where?

1889
01:49:38,766 --> 01:49:39,700
[grunts]

1893
01:49:47,875 --> 01:49:50,044
Ha! Victory is mine!

1894
01:49:50,177 --> 01:49:52,747
Hey, no fair!
That shouldn't count.

1895
01:49:52,880 --> 01:49:55,015
First base
is also mine!

1896
01:49:55,149 --> 01:49:56,852
I think that was
our only ball.
[laughs]

1897
01:49:56,984 --> 01:49:59,754
I have conquered
the second of the bases!

1898
01:49:59,887 --> 01:50:01,255
Who wants ice cream?

1899
01:50:01,389 --> 01:50:02,690
Knocked the cover off that.

1900
01:50:02,824 --> 01:50:05,126
Ice cream!
Ice cream, yeah!

1901
01:50:05,259 --> 01:50:09,263
[laughing]
I am having the fun!
What is ice cream?

1902
01:50:09,397 --> 01:50:12,600
It's a dessert.
If you like fun,
you're gonna love it.

1903
01:50:12,733 --> 01:50:16,003
Oh, yum. Dessert.
Does it have grapes in it?

1904
01:50:16,137 --> 01:50:17,738
No, not usually.

1905
01:50:17,873 --> 01:50:20,174
I'm proud of
our little guy.

1906
01:50:20,307 --> 01:50:23,812
I really like
his new friends,
especially the red one.

1907
01:50:23,944 --> 01:50:26,580
He cracks me up.

Come on, fox.

Our dessert adventure
awaits.
Whoo!

1910
01:50:29,750 --> 01:50:30,785
Good job,
guys.
Yeah.

1911
01:50:30,918 --> 01:50:32,219
You too, baby.

1912
01:50:32,353 --> 01:50:35,156
Let's go get some ice cream.
Come on, come on.

1913
01:50:35,289 --> 01:50:37,558
I'm happy for you, pal.

1914

Got your wingmen.

1915
01:50:39,226 --> 01:50:40,561
Perfect friends
to grow up with.

1916
01:50:40,694 --> 01:50:44,365
Come on, Knuckles.
Ah!
My victory chariot!

1917
01:50:46,167 --> 01:50:49,370
I've got a lot more
than that... Dad.

1918
01:50:54,708 --> 01:50:56,210
Race you to the truck.

1919
01:50:57,711 --> 01:50:58,979
One, two, three, go!

1920
01:50:59,113 --> 01:51:01,549
No, don't go easy on me.
I want your best.

1921
01:51:01,682 --> 01:51:04,585
Sonic, I have just been told
they have sprinkles.

1922
01:51:04,718 --> 01:51:08,389
Ice cream and sprinkles?
This is your new destiny.

1923
01:51:08,522 --> 01:51:13,394
What a perfect meal
to celebrate my victory
over you in base of ball.

1924
01:51:13,527 --> 01:51:16,230
What?
I mean,
you barely beat me.

1925
01:51:16,363 --> 01:51:19,600
Ha! You've never been
beaten so hard.

Agent, I want an update.

Still searching, sir.
We haven't found
