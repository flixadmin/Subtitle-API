00:38:08,593 --> 00:38:10,362
[Jaime] Oh, Rudy's
gonna kill me.

-[Rudy] Oh, my headlights!

-No! My mirrors!

802
00:38:19,305 --> 00:38:22,404
What the hell, man? [shrieks]

803
00:38:22,539 --> 00:38:25,272
What's wrong with you?<i> Cabezon!</i>

804
00:38:25,408 --> 00:38:26,911
Do you want some water?

805
00:38:27,047 --> 00:38:27,804
[Rudy] My tailgate!

806
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:29,807
No, I'm... I'm good. I'm fine.

807

-[Alberto] Okay.
-[door opens]

808
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,986
What did you do to the Taco?
[clears throat]

809
00:38:36,122 --> 00:38:37,789
And that... that's Rudy.

810
00:38:37,924 --> 00:38:40,621
My name's Cesar, okay?
And only my friends
call me Rudy.

811
00:38:40,757 --> 00:38:42,090
-I'm Jenny.
-[mocking] "I'm Jenny."

812
00:38:42,225 --> 00:38:43,494
Hi, Jenny.

813
00:38:43,629 --> 00:38:45,324
We know who you are.
What are you doing here?

814
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:47,757
Thinking about
turning our house into
a nuclear power plant?

815
00:38:47,893 --> 00:38:49,334
I went swimming out there

816
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:50,832
by where your family
has that company.

817

My testicles are seven times
their normal size.

818
00:38:53,537 --> 00:38:55,606
Shouldn't you be
pillaging cobalt

819
00:38:55,741 --> 00:38:58,476
from some developing country
or something, Jenny?

820
00:38:59,443 --> 00:39:01,444
-Where is it?
-Yeah.

821
00:39:01,579 --> 00:39:04,046
-Allow me.
-[family exclaiming]

822
00:39:04,181 --> 00:39:05,349

[Rocio yelling in Spanish]

826

[in English]
I thought the<i> chingaderas</i>
would come out.

827
00:39:12,489 --> 00:39:13,888
-Come out?
-Jeez.

828
00:39:14,023 --> 00:39:15,786
-What is he talking about?
-He's talking about this.

829

-[Nana exclaims]
-[gasping]

830

[gags] Oh, I forgot
how bad it looks.

[in Spanish]

832
00:39:21,194 --> 00:39:22,064
[in English]
No, it doesn't look that bad.

[in Spanish]

834
00:39:23,303 --> 00:39:24,532
[in English] I've seen worse.

835
00:39:24,667 --> 00:39:26,304
-Where?
-You don't wanna know.

836
00:39:26,439 --> 00:39:28,206
Okay, what the hell
is this thing?

837
00:39:28,341 --> 00:39:30,001
It's... it's called the Scarab.

838
00:39:30,137 --> 00:39:32,906
It was given to my dad
when I was a kid, um...

839
00:39:33,041 --> 00:39:35,407
It's some kind
of a world destroying weapon.

840
00:39:35,542 --> 00:39:36,774
Oh, that's nice.

841
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:38,247
-Weapon?
-What did she say?

842
00:39:38,382 --> 00:39:40,585
[Jaime groaning] What?

843
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,653
And did you know what was
gonna happen to my brother

844
00:39:42,788 --> 00:39:45,218
when you stuck him with
this world destroying thing?

845
00:39:45,354 --> 00:39:47,485
No, I swear to you,
I had no idea
this would happen.

846
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:49,155
I mean, come on.

847
00:39:49,291 --> 00:39:51,227
My father said it can't be
activated by just any person.

848
00:39:51,362 --> 00:39:52,794
It has to choose you.

849
00:39:53,895 --> 00:39:56,563
So I'm guessing
it's chosen you.

850
00:39:56,698 --> 00:39:57,963
[Rudy] No more blind dates.

851
00:39:58,099 --> 00:40:01,372
Okay. So, how do we get it
to un-choose me?

852
00:40:01,508 --> 00:40:03,774
I don't know.
But we better move fast,

853
00:40:03,909 --> 00:40:06,003
because my aunt
will kill us all
just to get it back.

854

-Kill us?
-[dismayed murmuring]

No, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.

856
00:40:08,944 --> 00:40:10,340
She's the one who sent
the assassins.

[in English]
I'm so sorry I put you all
in this situation.

861
00:40:18,151 --> 00:40:20,388
I had no idea
it would activate.

862
00:40:20,523 --> 00:40:21,756
Really. I didn't know.

863
00:40:21,892 --> 00:40:23,625
-That's convenient.
-[all chattering]

864
00:40:23,761 --> 00:40:25,024
But she already said
she didn't know.

865
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:27,264
She's a Kord, dude.
You seriously trust her?

[Alberto calming in Spanish]

We are going to figure it out.
We always do.

Come on, we are the Reyes.

We've dealt with harder things.

-We have?

He's right.

Okay, so, how are we gonna
get this thing outta me?

busts another hole
in our house.

-[Rocio] Exactly.
-[Jenny exhales]

There's a place where
we can get some answers.

879
00:41:03,863 --> 00:41:04,828
But we need the key.

880
00:41:04,964 --> 00:41:07,600
Okay, so where's the key?

881
00:41:07,735 --> 00:41:09,469
At the Kord building.

882
00:41:09,604 --> 00:41:11,876
And they're probably
on high alert over there
since I took the Scarab.

883
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:15,542
So, what are we talking about?
Laser-based security system?

884
00:41:15,678 --> 00:41:17,348
Wide area motion imagery?

885
00:41:17,483 --> 00:41:19,782
Maybe, uh... photonic emitters?

886
00:41:20,746 --> 00:41:22,582
I really don't--

887
00:41:22,717 --> 00:41:25,255
Because I've been
working on something
that I believe can help us.

888
00:41:25,391 --> 00:41:27,889
And it's almost finished.

889
00:41:28,024 --> 00:41:29,720
If I can get
the mechanical structure right.

890
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:30,820
Mm. I love you, Ma.

891
00:41:30,956 --> 00:41:32,791

[General Crane]
You're aware that
if you deliver the O.M.A.C.,

897
00:42:05,398 --> 00:42:06,563
you'd be the most powerful

in the world.

899

If you buy into this, you can
call me whatever you want.

General,
this is Lieutenant Carapax.

903
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:18,907
He's been crucial to the
development of the prototype,

904
00:42:19,042 --> 00:42:21,905
and I personally handpicked him
for his courage

905
00:42:22,041 --> 00:42:23,714
during the anti-communist

906
00:42:23,849 --> 00:42:27,278
counter-terrorism operations
in Guatemala.

907
00:42:27,414 --> 00:42:29,753
He's the perfect recipient
for the O.M.A.C.,

908
00:42:29,889 --> 00:42:31,751
and a product of the school
of the Americas.

909
00:42:31,887 --> 00:42:33,355
Great to meet you, Lieutenant.

Well, can't wait to see it
in action.

-When will it be ready?
-Oh, it's ready, isn't it?

913
00:42:40,427 --> 00:42:43,829
We're just putting some
finishing touches on it.

914
00:42:43,964 --> 00:42:45,533
[quietly] We have a problem.

915
00:42:45,669 --> 00:42:47,397
Well, if you'll excuse us.

916

[Victoria] You lost her? How?

918
00:42:55,878 --> 00:42:57,409
My men saw someone helping her.

919
00:42:57,545 --> 00:43:00,281
All right. I wanna find out
who she is working with now.

920
00:43:00,416 --> 00:43:03,787
Because without the Scarab,
we can't complete the O.M.A.C.

921
00:43:03,922 --> 00:43:07,217
I'm on it.
I will bring the Scarab back.

922
00:43:07,353 --> 00:43:09,056
This time
I'll do it personally.

923
00:43:09,191 --> 00:43:11,861
Well, I would hope so,
Carapax, because if not,

924
00:43:11,996 --> 00:43:14,462
all your sacrifices
will have been in vain.

925
00:43:14,597 --> 00:43:18,196
Just think of how much
suffering your body
has been through.

926
00:43:18,331 --> 00:43:20,735
I'm aware
of what you've done to it.

My God... What<i> we've</i> done.

Ignacio, I'm on your side.

Do you not remember what
it was like when I found you?

930

How badly crippled you were?

00:43:37,421 --> 00:43:38,954
How broken?

932
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:44,259
I am just trying to fix you.

933
00:43:44,394 --> 00:43:45,697
Okay?

934
00:43:48,695 --> 00:43:49,698
Good.

935
00:43:49,833 --> 00:43:51,769
I have to go back to the party.

936
00:43:53,704 --> 00:43:55,740
Now, go get me that Scarab.

Why?

You know,
when you make something cool,

942
00:44:15,059 --> 00:44:17,362
you can call yours
whatever you want, okay?

943
00:44:17,497 --> 00:44:20,193
Here, be useful. Hold that.

that this one works?

that Kord makes,

But when my mom died, he...
he really went adrift.

he left and...

1234
00:58:00,218 --> 00:58:01,618

1259
00:59:20,064 --> 00:59:23,493
[Rudy] Okay. [groans]
I've gone through the files.

1260
00:59:23,629 --> 00:59:27,503
So... Ted had a professor,
this guy named Dan Garrett.

1261
00:59:27,638 --> 00:59:29,801
The Scarab chose
this Garrett guy

1262
00:59:29,936 --> 00:59:31,434
before it chose you, Jaime.

1263
00:59:31,569 --> 00:59:34,403
And<i> pinche</i> Ted,
ran tests on him to map out

1264
00:59:34,539 --> 00:59:37,208
how the Scarab would react
to the human body.

1265
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:39,743
So, once this Scarab
goes up someone's ass...

1266
00:59:39,879 --> 00:59:41,518
It didn't go up my ass.

1267
00:59:41,654 --> 00:59:43,517
Okay. Well, it connects
to the brain

1268
00:59:43,652 --> 00:59:46,590
and that's what it's trying
to do to you, Jaime,
connect to your brain.

1269
00:59:46,725 --> 00:59:48,419
It's trying to become one
with you.

1270
00:59:48,555 --> 00:59:49,658
Why?

1271
00:59:49,793 --> 00:59:50,923
I think you should
ask it yourself.

1272
00:59:51,059 --> 00:59:52,658
I mean, this thing
has its own will.

1273
00:59:52,793 --> 00:59:53,759
[Jenny] It's sentient.

1274
00:59:53,895 --> 00:59:55,793
That's why it chooses a host.

1275
00:59:55,929 --> 00:59:58,767
That's why sometimes,
it does what you want,
and sometimes, it doesn't.

1276
00:59:58,903 --> 01:00:00,562
Okay, well, who made it?
Can they help us?

1277
01:00:00,698 --> 01:00:02,867
[chuckles] This wasn't made
on Earth,<i> cabezon.</i>

1278
01:00:03,002 --> 01:00:04,635
-No way.
<i> -Si</i> way.

1279
01:00:04,770 --> 01:00:06,743
It's alien.

1280
01:00:06,879 --> 01:00:08,406
Yeah. I don't really like
the term "alien."

1281
01:00:08,542 --> 01:00:10,343
-You can use it, but I just--
-Whatever, Rudy. Come on.

1282
01:00:10,479 --> 01:00:14,318
What happened
to Ted's professor guy?
How did he get it out?

1283
01:00:14,453 --> 01:00:15,719
You might want to sit down.

1284
01:00:18,021 --> 01:00:20,216
-Or not. All right--
-Rudy, please. Focus.

1285
01:00:20,352 --> 01:00:22,057
I got good news
and I got bad news.

1286
01:00:22,193 --> 01:00:24,393
The good news is,
I figured out how
to get it out.

1287
01:00:24,528 --> 01:00:25,895
-Fine.
-[chuckles]

1288
01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:28,292
And the bad news is
that you have to be dead.

1289
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:30,765
-What?
-Dead.

1290
01:00:30,901 --> 01:00:32,063
[Jaime] What do you
mean "dead"?

1291
01:00:32,199 --> 01:00:33,771
[Rudy] Okay, right now,
Jaime, look.

1292
01:00:33,906 --> 01:00:36,003
It's fusing itself
to every cell in your body.

1293
01:00:36,138 --> 01:00:39,370
It's completely coiled
around your brain.

1294
01:00:39,506 --> 01:00:41,776
And there's nothing on earth
that could remove it.

1295
01:00:41,912 --> 01:00:44,544
It's designed
to protect its host.

1296
01:00:44,679 --> 01:00:46,113
To keep it alive.

1297
01:00:46,249 --> 01:00:48,180
So you're saying that
this thing's in me forever?

1298
01:00:48,315 --> 01:00:50,420
-[sighing]
-[Rudy] No, it's not forever.

1299
01:00:50,556 --> 01:00:52,316
I mean, it's just until you...

1300
01:00:53,292 --> 01:00:54,657
until you die.

1301
01:00:54,793 --> 01:00:56,388
[stammering]
I think it's kinda cool.

1302
01:00:56,524 --> 01:00:59,862
No, I mean, basically,
you are a superhero,<i> cabron.</i>

1303
01:00:59,997 --> 01:01:02,229
I'm so sorry.
I had no way of knowing--

1304
01:01:02,364 --> 01:01:05,130
Oh, you had no idea.
So then what are
my options now?

1305
01:01:05,266 --> 01:01:08,535
So, option one is
to become an android

1306
01:01:08,671 --> 01:01:10,104
for the rest of my life.

1307
01:01:10,239 --> 01:01:12,367
Or option two is to hand myself
over to a murderous

1308
01:01:12,503 --> 01:01:14,541
-billionaire psychopath?
-I'm so sorry.

1309
01:01:14,677 --> 01:01:16,010
All I wanted was a job.

1310
01:01:16,146 --> 01:01:18,446
-[Rudy] Maybe there's a--
-Maybe what, Rudy?

1311
01:01:18,581 --> 01:01:20,015
It's all bad news.

1312
01:01:20,151 --> 01:01:21,552
Okay, this shit just doesn't
get any better for us.

1313
01:01:21,687 --> 01:01:23,446
I don't understand
why you can't...

1314

God. [sighs]

1315
01:01:26,452 --> 01:01:28,985
Whatever. I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go for a walk.

1316
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:30,754
[Jenny] Jaime, just...

1317
01:01:30,889 --> 01:01:33,088
Let me go talk to him.
I think I know
where he's going.

There he is.
I knew I'd find you out here.

1323
01:01:55,786 --> 01:01:57,887

I'm sorry for yelling
at you, Rudy.

1327
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,331

yelled at you, but...
-[Rudy speaks Spanish]

1328
01:02:10,467 --> 01:02:13,670
[in English]
It's not lost on me
that your situation

1329
01:02:13,806 --> 01:02:16,136
is a little bit
out of the ordinary.

1330
01:02:18,138 --> 01:02:20,310
[light chuckle] Yeah, we're...

1331
01:02:20,446 --> 01:02:22,209
we're resilient people.

1332
01:02:22,344 --> 01:02:26,047
Life will continue to hit us
with curve balls, and...

1333
01:02:26,183 --> 01:02:29,414
difference is, when we
get hit, we get stronger.

1334
01:02:29,550 --> 01:02:33,820
Look at your old man.
He brought me here from Sonora.

1335
01:02:33,956 --> 01:02:38,521
I was ten. I think he was 19.

1336
01:02:38,656 --> 01:02:41,260
And people think
crossing the border is hard.

1337
01:02:41,396 --> 01:02:43,295
Yeah, it's hard,
but you know what's harder?

And not that he wanted to,
he had to.

1346
01:03:09,991 --> 01:03:11,861
That's what we come from.

1347
01:03:11,996 --> 01:03:15,462
The universe has
sent you a gift, Jaime.

1348
01:03:15,597 --> 01:03:18,495
And you have to figure out
what you're going to do
with it.

1349
01:03:18,630 --> 01:03:20,970
Maybe this did all happen
for a reason.

1350
01:03:22,073 --> 01:03:25,205
Maybe it's time
that we get our own hero.

Don't say that, man.

You're not a failed promise.
