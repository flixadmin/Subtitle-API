3
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:18,940
Hello?

4
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:19,770
Hello?

5
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:21,090
Mr. John?

6
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:22,410
How do you do, sir?

7
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:25,130
Hello?
I am good, but who's this?

8
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:26,330
Dubey.

9
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:28,130
Manoj Dubey, sir.
Remember?

10
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:30,450
I show you girls in UP?

11
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:34,570
You eat Chole-Kulcha, very spicy, sir?

12
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:35,970
Oh yeah.

13
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:38,130
Yes, of course.
Mr. Dubey, how are you?

14
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:40,050
Fantastic, sir.

15
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:42,170
So... you still in Delhi?

16
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,730
No, we left actually.

17
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:45,410
We're going to Rajasthan.

18
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,050
Okay.
Great, great.

19
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:50,290
Rajasthan is very beautiful.

20
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:52,570
Good news for you, sir.

21
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:56,570
We have some beautiful
young girls here for you.

22
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:58,930
That's nice, Mr. Dubey.

23
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:02,130
But we actually don't want your girls.

24
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:04,970
- Sorry.
- But sir, we got new stock here.

25
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,530
Just like you wanted.

26
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:09,570
I'm whatsapping you their pics.

27
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,290
You'll definitely like, sir.

28
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,330
Just see the pics and call me back.

29
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:15,530
Mr. Dubey, I've discussed it with my wife.

30
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:18,090
And we're gonna find our own surrogate.

31
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:19,410
Thank you, Mr. Dubey.

32
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:20,810
Sir...!

33
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,410
Is that the Surrogacy Clinic guy?

34
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:27,410
Yeah.

35
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:29,610
He has new girls for us.

36
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,610
Those girls are physically weak, John.

37
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,410
You've seen that place?

38
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:38,290
It's like a factory out there.

39
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:39,610
I know.

40
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,210
I told him,
but obviously he wants to make money.

41
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,250
Well, money is not the problem.

42
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,170
We need a young and healthy girl.

43
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,810
I know, honey.
I know.

44
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,210
We'll find her.

45
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:11,090
Sir?

46
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:15,570
Sorry?

47
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:18,530
Girl?
You want girl?

48
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:20,490
I want a girl?

49
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:21,290
Oh.

50
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,090
You know, you and madam... very forward.

51
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,530
We cannot handle one
woman and he wants two.

52
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:27,530
What, John?

53
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,650
Are you telling him
that you want another woman?

54
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:31,170
No, no.

55
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:33,130
Bhanu, when did I say that?

56
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,370
In car you both (were) talking...

57
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:36,650
Healthy and fit girl?

58
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,410
Oh my God, no!
Bhanu, listen,

59
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:41,970
we want a girl, but not for John.

60
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,330
You are quite fluent in Hindi.

61
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:46,770
I spent six years in Delhi.

62
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:48,330
I attended Hindi classes there.

63
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:49,410
Wonderful.

64
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,970
Then who do you need a girl for?

65
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:56,410
We need a ma for our child.

66
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:00,770
Ma?

67
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:02,610
You mean a Dayima?

68
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:04,090
What's a Dayima?

69
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:08,770
Dayima is someone who looks
after your child when you go out.

70
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:09,930
No, no, no.

71
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:15,160
We want a girl who looks
after our child, inside.

72
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:18,330
Inside?

73
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:19,410
What do you mean by inside?

74
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,690
In her womb.

75
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,130
Our child...

76
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:26,490
- Okay.
- In her womb.

77
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,610
We want a surrogate mother.

78
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:34,250
Because I can't conceive.

79
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:36,970
Your child in her womb?

80
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:38,410
Hmm?

81
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,970
I'll explain it to you, come on.

82
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:45,130
So that's how it works.

83
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:46,410
This is amazing.

84
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,970
We don't have kids either.
Been married 12 years.

85
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:52,610
I'll ask if she would
like to give this a try.

86
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:55,810
It's not cheap, costs millions.

87
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,410
Oh God.

88
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,050
It's not our cup of tea then.

89
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:04,210
We poor people take a loan
to educate our children,

90
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:06,410
not to have them.

91
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:07,810
What's he saying?

92
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:12,330
He's saying that he's been trying
to have a baby for a long time too.

93
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:16,210
And that he would never
be able to afford a surrogate.

94
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:18,410
No worries, ma'am.

95
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:22,530
I'll work hard
and have one naturally.

96
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:23,970
Bhanu?

97
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:25,770
- Yes?
- I'm sorry to hear that.

98
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,530
So you understand
what we're going through.

99
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:29,850
- Yes.
- Yeah.

100
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:34,290
So could you help us find a surrogate?

101
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:37,050
You are family, sir.
Why not?

102
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:38,650
But I am a poor guy...

103
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,090
Money?

104
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:41,530
Of course, we'll pay you.

105
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:42,570
How much?

106
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:44,690
Five.

107
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,370
That's too less, sir.

108
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,650
You know how expensive cooking gas is?

109
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:51,090
- At least make it ten.
- Ten?

110
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:52,970
That's a lot.

111
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:55,490
We can't afford that much.

112
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:59,050
We can only afford to give 500,000.

113
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:02,130
Bhanu?

114
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:03,210
Huh?

115
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:06,730
Five...

116
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:08,250
500,000.

117
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:10,130
For that kind of money,
even I'd agree to carry your baby.

118
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,090
Done, sir.

119
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:14,570
Deal.

120
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:15,690
Deal.

121
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:17,930
Rajendra?

122
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,050
Go call her.

123
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:22,730
Move it.

124
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,050
Amma, come on out.

125
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:32,410
Shanu Amma.

126
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,250
She has had 14 kids.

127
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:36,010
Two pairs of twins.

128
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:37,490
She is quite experienced.

129
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:38,810
Best surrogate.

130
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,090
- Bhanu!
- Hmm?

131
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:44,810
She won't work.

132
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:45,810
Why not?

133
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,090
She is quite talented.

134
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:50,410
Back in the day,
she'd climb a tree in no time.

135
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:52,050
Amma, can you still climb a tree?

136
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:52,770
Yes.

137
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:54,810
Go and climb one for us.

138
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:56,650
No, no, no, no, no.
Please stop.

139
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:58,250
- Stop.
- What is happening?

140
00:06:58,530 --> 00:06:59,570
Bhanu,

141
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:02,490
she cannot be our surrogate.

142
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:05,210
We want a young girl.

143
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,170
Young.

144
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:07,290
Not this old.

145
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:11,930
Bhanu... the surrogate doesn't decide
the look of the baby,

146
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:13,410
it decides the health.

147
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:17,650
Can you explain this to him?

148
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:20,410
We have to be safe.

149
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:23,490
One of our friends
picked a surrogate here,

150
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,490
but she was very weak.

151
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:29,810
So unfortunately,
the baby didn't survive.

152
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:33,810
I get it.

153
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:35,410
Amma, go inside.

154
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,410
I'll get you the best merch.

155
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:39,410
Merch?

156
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:43,250
Merch?

157
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:44,410
Ma.

158
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:46,730
I said Ma.

159
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:48,530
Please come with me, sir.

160
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:50,410
Let's go, sir.

161
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:55,130
"Hey Bikaneri chick, you are so slick."

162
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:56,530
"Lost my house because of you,"

163
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,210
"And now I'm about to lose my job too."

164
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:19,010
"Hey Romeos!"

165
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:20,970
"Roadside Romeos!"

166
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:23,610
"Innocent looking deceptive..."

167
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:25,010
"liars!"

168
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:29,010
[Background vocal]

169
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:36,610
"Hey Romeos, worthless boyos!"

170
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:40,570
"Stop bothering me,
you good for nothing fellows."

171
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:42,530
"You have already stolen our hearts,"

172
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:44,330
"Don't leave us behind."

173
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:48,250
"This isn't right, my love."

174
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:50,330
"You sometimes look like Mona Lisa."

175
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:52,130
"And sometimes like a mesmerising Lolita."

176
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:52,530
"Oh."

177
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:55,410
"And sometimes like a mystery."

178
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:59,330
"You are a super-super-super
supreme beauty."

179
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:03,330
"You are a super-super-super
supreme beauty."

180
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:07,210
"From head to toe, an absolute beauty."

181
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:11,610
"You are a super-super-super
supreme beauty."

182
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,570
"Hey supreme beauty..."

183
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:23,530
[Background vocal]

184
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:27,210
[Background vocal]

185
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:35,090
"I can't be tied down."

186
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:39,050
"I am like the wild wind."

187
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:42,850
"I have a long way ahead of me."

188
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:44,770
"I am not interested in gems or jewels,"

189
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,730
"I am interested in chasing my dreams."

190
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:51,050
"I am used to my dreams coming true."

191
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:54,570
"I don't want men chasing me."

192
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:59,210
"I am made for the big screen."

193
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:01,170
"You have already stolen our hearts,"

194
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,050
"Don't leave us behind."

195
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:06,690
"This isn't right, my love."

196
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:08,650
"You sometimes look like Mona Lisa."

197
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:09,210
"Buzz off."

198
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:10,850
"And sometimes like a mesmerising Lolita."

199
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:14,050
"And sometimes like a mystery."

200
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:18,010
"You are a super-super-super
supreme beauty."

201
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:21,810
"You are a super-super-super
supreme beauty."

202
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:25,730
"From head to toe, an absolute beauty."

203
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:30,010
"You are a super-super-super
supreme beauty."

204
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:34,090
"Don't touch me."

205
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:38,170
"I don't want be yours."

206
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:42,210
"I don't care even
if you beg for my company."

207
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:45,730
"No, no, no..."

208
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:49,770
"No, no, no..."

209
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:53,850
"Hey Bikaneri chick, you are so slick."

210
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:55,490
"Lost my house because of you,"

211
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:58,130
"And now I'm about to lose my job too."

212
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:00,130
"Looking at your curves,"

213
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:02,130
"My heart starts to race."

214
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:05,970
"Like the hands of a clock
going hickory, dickory, dockery."

215
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:09,650
"No, no, no..."

216
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:15,410
Owner's car...

217
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:16,210
driver's sweat...

218
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:18,210
makes the journey heartfelt.

219
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:19,450
Cheers.

220
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:20,610
Cheers.

221
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:23,650
Hey, Jolly Bro!

222
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:24,650
How are you?

223
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:26,490
When are you coming here?

224
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:28,610
It will take some time, Bro.

225
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:31,850
How much time are we talking about, huh?

226
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:34,570
Thousands of girls folk to
Mumbai every day to become a star.

227
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:36,530
The more you delay the
slimmer your chances get.

228
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:38,970
I need to have enough dough to come there.

229
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:41,090
You need to hurry up, girl.

230
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:42,410
I had a word with Dabboo,

231
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:43,850
he takes 500,000 for a photo shoot.

232
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:44,810
Excluding costume and makeup.

233
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:45,850
500,000?

234
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:47,450
For a photo shoot?

235
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:49,650
Does he do with a camera made of gold?

236
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:53,250
He's the most sought after
photographer in Bollywood.

237
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:56,570
How about we first shoot
a music video instead then?

238
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:57,530
We'll make it go viral.

239
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:59,050
It won't cost you much.

240
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:00,690
Just about need a million, yeah?

241
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:02,330
I'll have a word with Bhushan.

242
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:02,770
Jolly?

243
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:03,850
You're at a shoot!

244
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:07,770
Who was that?

245
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:08,650
Hello?

246
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:10,410
Sounded like he was
speaking to Shah Rukh Khan.

247
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:11,850
- Really?
- Really.

248
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:13,050
What was Jolly saying?

249
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:14,410
How much I have managed.

250
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:17,570
How can I possibly achieve
my dream with this, Shama?

251
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,850
Just have patience.

252
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:22,170
Patience bears fruits.

253
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:25,130
I've been dieting
on patience for years now.

254
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:29,530
Bhanu.

255
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:30,730
Sir.

256
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:32,610
I was saying my evening prayers.

257
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:35,610
What is it?

258
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:38,770
Bhanu, we have something
we'd like to tell you.

259
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,330
Yes?

260
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,290
Honey..

261
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,610
We liked a girl.

262
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:48,770
We want someone like
her to be our surrogate.

263
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:49,610
Who is this girl?

264
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:50,570
Who? Who?

265
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:55,810
Well, she's beautiful,
she's tall and she's a dancer.

266
00:12:56,090 --> 00:13:00,130
Oh, the tall girl who
was dancing downstairs?

267
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:02,410
Why didn't I think of her?

268
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:05,170
If we could get someone like her...?

269
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,410
Why someone like her?
We can get her.

270
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:08,810
Really?

271
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:10,570
Is that possible?

272
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:11,850
Yes, of course.

273
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:13,210
You are family.

274
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:14,530
Keep the money ready.

275
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:16,570
- Money can buy everything.
- What is happening?

276
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:18,730
- He's saying that he thinks may be able to get--
- Sir?

277
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:23,530
How much do you plan on paying her?

278
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:25,490
Money?

279
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:30,250
How many times do I have
to tell you to hurry up?

280
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:31,330
We won't find a ride home now.

281
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:32,770
We will.

282
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:33,810
Give me the money.

283
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:34,850
Here.

284
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:38,010
Let's go.

285
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:46,330
No, I can talk.

286
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:49,050
Bhanu Pratap, an art lover.

287
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:51,410
That was an amazing performance.

288
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:52,570
- My God!
- Thanks.

289
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:55,770
How are you guys going home?

290
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:57,410
By rickshaw?

291
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:58,490
If we get one.

292
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:01,410
You'll take a rickshaw?

293
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:03,170
Such a big star will travel in a rickshaw?

294
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,410
I cannot let that happen.

295
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:06,410
How will I face the society?

296
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:07,850
How will I face God?

297
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:09,010
Not possible.

298
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:11,170
Well, this is the only you have,
So there is no other option.

299
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:14,770
Your friend is so funny.

300
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:16,770
Come, let me drop you home in my taxi.

301
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:18,050
You own a taxi?

302
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:19,650
- Yes.
- How much will you charge us?

303
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:22,410
Come on,
how can I take money from you?

304
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:24,210
I am an art lover.

305
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:25,730
I am your fan.

306
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:27,250
A big fan.

307
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:29,610
- No thank you, we'll manage.
- No.

308
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:31,290
He's a fan.

309
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:32,530
We cannot refuse him.

310
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:34,130
Give me the rickshaw fare.

311
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:35,530
- Let's go.
- Yes, you shouldn't break your fan's heart.

312
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:37,210
- Let me carry your bag.
- No, I can manage.

313
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:39,490
My taxi's parked right outside.

314
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:41,570
You gave a mind-blowing performance.

315
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:48,170
"I learnt to walk holding your hand."

316
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:54,050
"I thrived under your care."

317
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:55,850
"Mother!"

318
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:59,210
"Oh my mother..."

319
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:00,450
Mother! Oh my mother!

320
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:02,810
A mother God's best gift to mankind.

321
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:04,250
Don't you think?

322
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:06,210
Right.

323
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:08,970
A mother-child relationship,

324
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:10,730
is the most pious
one in the world.

325
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:15,250
Looks like you love your mother a lot.

326
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:16,530
A lot.

327
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,290
- What's her name?
- Kainkayi.

328
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:21,970
You don't say!
And you still love her?

329
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,530
Love her?

330
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:27,130
I owe my life to her.

331
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:30,490
She nurtured me in
her womb for nine months.

332
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:34,130
Being a mother
is the greatest gift on earth.

333
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,850
If I could,
I would carry a child myself.

334
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:38,530
And where would
the baby come out from?

335
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:39,610
The rare end?

336
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:45,210
That's the problem with men.

337
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,970
We cannot give birth.

338
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:51,090
What should I do?

339
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:52,530
Take a right and drop me home.

340
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:53,930
Then do whatever you please.

341
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:00,250
You can pull up here.

342
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:03,010
Bye.

343
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:09,090
You have the dagger, right?

344
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:10,690
- Hmm?
- You have the dagger, right?

345
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:14,770
Yes, I do. I have the dagger.

346
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,170
Call once you reach home.

347
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,050
I'll call you.

348
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:18,970
- Good night.
- Good night.

349
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:22,450
Step on it.

350
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:24,650
Drive!

351
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:33,250
Pull up here.

352
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:34,090
- Here?
- Yes.

353
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:41,410
Excuse me?

354
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:43,130
What's wrong?
Did I forget something?

355
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,290
No, you didn't.

356
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:46,410
Well--

357
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:59,170
Well, like I said, being a
mother is the greatest gift on earth.

358
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:02,410
So what does that have to do with me?

359
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:07,570
I hope your dagger isn't too sharp.

360
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:08,810
Should I chop something off?

361
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:09,730
Something?

362
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:11,650
Anything you want.

363
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,250
No, thank you.

364
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:15,050
What were you saying?

365
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:18,130
Come on, tell me.

366
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:21,490
What is it?

367
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:23,650
Well...

368
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:30,330
You have something that men don't.

369
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:33,290
A womb.
The place where babies grow.

370
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:35,090
Are you drunk?

371
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:36,050
No.

372
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:40,410
I did have just a bit.

373
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:42,650
- Bloody drunkard.
- Please hear me out.

374
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:48,970
The American couple
staying at the Amar Mahal?

375
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:50,970
Did you see them?

376
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:52,010
No.

377
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:54,210
I'll introduce you to them tomorrow.

378
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:59,730
They... like you.

379
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:03,410
They want you to have their baby.

380
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:06,410
Because you are a dancer.

381
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:07,610
You have a great body.

382
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:09,570
God has blessed you with great features.

383
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:15,290
Who was that?

384
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:16,410
No one!

385
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:22,290
"Oh my beloved..."

386
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:27,210
"Oh my beloved..."

387
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,490
Saw the number of
likes on my FB, hmm?

388
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:44,410
855 likes.

389
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:46,810
I am sure it'll reach 1000 by tomorrow.

390
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:48,610
Just read the comments.

391
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:51,450
"Hot!"

392
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,650
"Set fire to the rain!"

393
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:58,130
I have quite a fan following out here.

394
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:02,250
Call me to Bombay already, my Romeo!

395
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:05,410
Hot!

396
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:14,410
Let me go you bandit!

397
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:16,730
You're crazy!

398
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:23,490
My bad luck is your good luck, girls.

399
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:27,850
You will be out of jobs once I get there.

400
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:29,530
No one will even think about you.

401
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:35,130
All the heroes will
chase me screaming Mimi-Mimi.

402
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:37,210
I am coming!

403
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:41,810
Wrong scale, Dad.

404
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:43,130
You should pick a higher scale.

405
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:45,850
Now you'll teach me about music, huh?

406
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:49,050
Isn't she a part of your lineage, uncle?

407
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:50,130
Hello!

408
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:52,290
I have my own identity.

409
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:54,250
I have done 72 shows.

410
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:55,130
How many, kids?

411
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:56,410
72.

412
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:57,850
Right.

413
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:59,610
Her videos are on FB, you know?

414
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:02,130
Sis, what's the name
of the magazine that you read?

415
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:03,170
Cosmopolitan.

416
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:06,970
You wouldn't read this nonsense
if you would have finished college.

417
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,850
Mind your own business, Mom.

418
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:10,410
I know what I want from life.

419
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:13,850
Why don't you enlighten me?
What do you want from life?

420
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:19,290
Mr. Jadawat's daughter
got married at the age of 21.

421
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:20,490
And this one.

422
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:22,850
There! That's where they go wrong, Aatif.

423
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:24,490
They just don't get it.

424
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:28,330
PC wouldn't be a star
if her parents hadn't encouraged her.

425
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:29,410
PC?

426
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:30,970
Priyanka Chopra, Uncle.

427
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:32,730
Went from Bareilly to Bollywood
and became a star.

428
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:35,930
But her father was a doctor
in the army,

429
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:37,290
not some ordinary Joe.

430
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:39,010
Come here.

431
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:41,410
Who did you call an ordinary Joe, huh?

432
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:42,650
You.

433
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:48,650
Tell me something,
how do you know all this?

434
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:50,410
Social network, Uncle.

435
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:51,410
I am telling you!!!

436
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,810
You should open
an account with Facebook.

437
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:55,370
It only costs 200 bucks.

438
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:56,290
Think again.

439
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:58,050
Facebook?

440
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:01,650
I think you've dropped your money.

441
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:03,970
Someone stole your sandals.

442
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:05,770
Excuse me.

443
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:09,450
Excuse me, please.
Auntie, your veil's sweeping the floor.

444
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:11,050
Yours' too.

445
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:12,410
I'm coming, I'm coming.

446
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:13,970
Priest!

447
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:16,490
I hope you are putting
in a good word for me.

448
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:18,250
I come twice a week these days.

449
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:20,010
I had a word with God.

450
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:22,410
Asked Him to bless you
with a handsome husband,

451
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,170
and a beautiful child.

452
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:25,490
You don't say!

453
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:28,050
No wonder it is taking so long!
That's not what I want.

454
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:29,370
I want to go to Bollywood.

455
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:30,450
Where's that?

456
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:33,410
A wrong priest can mess up your plans.

457
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:35,970
You should reconsider, auntie.

458
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:42,330
[Prayers]

459
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:50,330
Hey!

460
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:51,530
Put it on my tab.

461
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:52,530
Give me the plate.

462
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:53,770
Put that on my tab as well.

463
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,410
Does she come here every day?

464
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:03,330
Mimi ji?

465
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:04,410
Mimi ji?

466
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:06,010
Can I have a minute, Mimi ji?

467
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:07,570
What is it?
Why are you following me?

468
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:09,490
Do you want another slap?
Or my sandal?

469
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:11,330
Please hear me out.

470
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:13,410
Then beat me or slap me.

471
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:14,970
Look, I'm offering you my other cheek.

472
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:16,410
Please, just hear me out.

473
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,170
Fine, out with it.

474
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:37,130
You slapped me for no reason.

475
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:38,290
For no reason?

476
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:40,330
You asked me to sleep
with that foreigner.

477
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:42,050
You should thank God
I only slapped you.

478
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:45,130
Where I am from,
we usually smash faces.

479
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:46,530
For no reason he says!

480
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:48,330
You misunderstand.

481
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:51,810
You don't have to sleep
with John to have his baby.

482
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:55,290
He won't even touch you.
No physical contact.

483
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:57,610
Are you drunk again?

484
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:03,610
Mimi ji, this is a new method.

485
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:06,290
It's called surrogacy.

486
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:07,410
What? Legacy?

487
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:09,530
Not legacy.

488
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:11,210
Let me explain.

489
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:12,330
Do you own a farm?

490
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:14,530
My uncle has one in Dholpur.
How does that matter?

491
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:16,170
What does he grow?

492
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:17,170
Sugarcane.

493
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:18,330
Okay.
Perfect.

494
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:22,450
So basically John and Summer want
to grow their sugarcane in your farm.

495
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:24,650
Do they want a sugarcane
or a baby?

496
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:27,130
Sugarcane = baby.

497
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:29,210
Carry on.

498
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:31,170
Summer's land is barren.

499
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:34,170
She will take your farm on rent.

500
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:35,810
John will plant the seed.

501
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:37,610
Summer will provide
the necessary manure.

502
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:41,290
You will hand over the sugarcane
to them as soon as it is ready,

503
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:43,530
and they'll pay you rent
for using your farm.

504
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:49,010
Your womb.. Their child...

505
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:52,730
So I won't have to sleep with anyone?

506
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:53,770
No.

507
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:55,770
- And I'll give birth to a baby?
- Yes.

508
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:57,290
You don't say!

509
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:59,330
Science has surely made
a lot of progress.

510
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:01,650
Is that really happening? For real?

511
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:02,730
Yes.

512
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:04,330
A lot of people do it.

513
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:06,570
That's what I have been
trying to explain to you.

514
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:08,410
Right.

515
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:14,170
So I need to carry their
baby in my womb for nine months.

516
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:16,210
You got it.

517
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:17,850
Have you lost your freaking mind?

518
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:19,650
Why on earth would I do that?

519
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:22,370
I want to be a movie star
and he wants me to become a mother.

520
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:23,610
There are so many women
in this country,

521
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:24,650
go find someone else.

522
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:25,970
Crazy man.

523
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:28,210
Zip it!

524
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:29,170
No crying!

525
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:31,050
Get him to shut up.

526
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:32,970
Crazy woman.

527
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:37,810
Mimi ji, you'll get 2 million for it.

528
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:40,130
2 million.

529
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:47,410
You want to go to Bollywood, right?

530
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:49,290
Isn't that what you prayed for?

531
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:52,010
It's a sign from God.

532
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:55,250
2 million.

533
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:53,130
Mom, does it hurt a lot,
while giving birth?

534
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:56,690
It hurts more
when your child strays away.

535
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:51,330
'Mimi ji, you'll get 2 million for it.'

536
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:53,610
'You want to go to Bollywood, right?'

537
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:55,410
'Isn't that what you prayed for?'

538
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:58,090
'It's a sign from God.'

539
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:01,690
'2 million.'

540
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:06,610
Stop bullshitting me.

541
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:08,690
This is what that guy said.

542
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:10,050
He's a nutcase.

543
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:11,970
Don't pay any heed to him.

544
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:17,410
It is quite common these days.

545
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:21,690
Girls are making millions
by renting out their wombs.

546
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:24,770
We cannot eat shit just
because someone else is.

547
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:30,210
Because we have a grand feast
laid out for us, right?

548
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:32,890
Don't just look at the
money that's being offered.

549
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:34,250
Give some thought to
what you have to do.

550
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:35,450
What should I do?

551
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:37,370
Jolly called,

552
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:38,690
asking when I'm coming to Bombay.

553
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:39,770
What should I tell him?

554
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:45,770
You know PC, Bebo, Kangana...

555
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:47,210
They were also surrogates?

556
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:50,050
No, they became actresses
at a very young age.

557
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:51,730
And I am already 25!

558
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:54,130
Any longer and I'll have
to play a mother instead.

559
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:56,370
I need to become a mother now,

560
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:58,210
to avoid to playing one on screen.

561
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:01,370
Think about it, Shama.

562
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:03,050
It's a lot of money.

563
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:04,330
Hard cash.

564
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:05,570
Give it another thought.

565
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:10,770
I am tired of dancing for peanuts.

566
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:15,090
All I am asking you to do
is meet the couple.

567
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:17,250
If we don't like it, we'll refuse.

568
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:29,330
Good Lord, he is so handsome.

569
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:32,330
I wouldn't mind sleeping
with him to have his baby.

570
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:35,330
Yes, he is hot.

571
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:36,530
Look at his eyes!

572
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:41,530
He is hot, but he won't sleep
with you, he's my husband.

573
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:42,610
What the hell!

574
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:46,370
Hindi... you speak?

575
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:48,610
I forgot to mention,
she speaks quite well.

576
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:51,130
She also knows the Gayatri
Mantra and Hanuman Chalisa.

577
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:53,250
Stop exaggerating.

578
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:54,650
I am not that good at it.

579
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:56,490
Good.

580
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:04,090
So tell me, the woman who gives
birth to your baby gets 2 million?

581
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:05,450
Yes.

582
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:06,570
Yes.

583
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:08,530
And we like you.

584
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:10,210
Why her?

585
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:12,570
Why not someone else?

586
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:14,250
Why do you want it to be her?

587
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:16,330
Because she is super fit.

588
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:17,450
She is healthy.

589
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:18,770
And she's a dancer.

590
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:23,170
Athletes and dancers,
they have the best bodies.

591
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:27,410
Such ladies give birth
to healthy children.

592
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:29,330
Best body.

593
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:30,490
That's why.

594
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:33,970
Mimi ji, if you have
any questions for them,

595
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:35,850
about the baby, about the method,

596
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:36,770
then please go ahead.

597
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:37,810
Right.

598
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:40,490
In how many instalments
do I get my 2 million?

599
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:45,490
So, we've decided we'll give 50,000
every month for the first nine months.

600
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:50,610
And the rest - 1,550,000,
after the delivery.

601
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:53,410
1,550,000 in one shot, hard cash?

602
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:58,050
You betcha! Crisp bank notes!

603
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:00,810
You two can sleep on a bed of money.

604
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:03,250
One more thing.

605
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:06,530
If I have twins,
do I get paid double?

606
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:07,650
- No.
- No.

607
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:08,690
Why "no"?

608
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:10,490
No, you won't.

609
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:13,530
Double babies, double pain.

610
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:15,850
And if I have triplets like Farah Khan?

611
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:16,810
Then tripple?

612
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:17,970
What's she saying?

613
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:21,810
- Well, she's saying--
- She's saying two babies, money double.

614
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:24,130
Three babies, money triple.

615
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:25,570
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

616
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:26,770
Whoa!

617
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:30,970
Mimi listen, if that happens
of course we'll pay you more.

618
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:35,250
But please, I'm begging you,
don't give us more than two.

619
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:36,770
We can't afford it.

620
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:39,690
Come on now,
as if thats in my hands.

621
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:41,810
One more thing.

622
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:45,410
We will have to take you
to a clinic in Jaipur for a check-up.

623
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:50,570
So, it'll be great if you can
let us know your decision quickly?

624
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:55,090
If you aren't ready to do this
then we'll have to find another girl.

625
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:57,250
We'll be paying her then.

626
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:58,130
Aah.

627
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:09,050
"Neither wife,
nor kids, nor parents, nothing matters."

628
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:14,010
"The whole thing is that...
money rules over everything."

629
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:21,010
All things said and done,
what will I tell my family about the baby?

630
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:22,770
I'll start showing in a couple of months.

631
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:24,650
I can't say that I have gained weight.

632
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:25,970
They won't buy it.

633
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,730
You don't need to tell them anything.

634
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:29,170
- What do you mean?
- What do you mean?

635
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:32,410
I mean many surrogate
mothers stay away from home.

636
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:34,570
Many don't tell their parents.

637
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:36,490
You too could stay away from home.

638
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:38,330
Now don't ask me to find you a place.

639
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:39,330
Find your own place.

640
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:42,410
Where can I go?

641
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:47,610
Well, you can stay with me.

642
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:50,610
I stay quite far away from your place.

643
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:52,410
You don't have a family?

644
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:54,130
It's just me and my dad.

645
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:56,330
My dad is hardly home.

646
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:58,490
I don't get to see
him for months myself.

647
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:00,090
Why?

648
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:01,410
He's a Maulvi

649
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:04,250
He barely steps out of a mosque.

650
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:05,690
And I cannot step inside it.

651
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:08,850
It's the best solution... for you.

652
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:10,610
Think about it.

653
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:18,410
It's the best solution.

654
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:20,090
"Money rules over everything."

655
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:26,570
The technique of IVF,
removes several fertile eggs

656
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:29,810
From the ovaries,
for fertilization in the laboratory

657
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:34,330
Doctor, this is the
girl we were talking about.

658
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:36,850
So you are Mimi?

659
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:38,570
You don't say!

660
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:39,850
Aren't you on FB?

661
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:43,810
Have you willingly agreed to do this?

662
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:45,970
No one can dare force me.

663
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:53,610
Mimi ji, you'll have to keep a few things
in mind after you get pregnant.

664
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:56,050
You'll have to eat healthy.

665
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:57,650
You'll have to go on walks.

666
00:32:57,730 --> 00:33:00,210
You'll have to stay happy and exercise--

667
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:02,410
Yes, yes.
Don't worry.

668
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:09,130
I'll carry the baby to term, hand
it over to them and collect my payment.

669
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:10,570
Money?

670
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:13,330
Do you have any doubts?

671
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:16,410
No.

672
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:20,090
Will I get stretch marks?

673
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:22,770
I mean, I hope it won't ruin my figure.

674
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:23,730
No.

675
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:25,490
- Have you gone through this?
- No.

676
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,250
So?

677
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:31,610
Has it ruined Shilpa Shetty's figure?

678
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:33,130
You don't say!

679
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:34,650
She is right.

680
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:35,650
Best body.

681
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:40,810
Mr. John, to start with
we will need your sperms.

682
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:43,570
Needhi will guide you
to the sperm deposit room.

683
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:45,850
Okay.

684
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:55,410
Sir?

685
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:59,410
If you need any help, call me?

686
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:02,610
That's kind of you, Bhanu.

687
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:05,450
I've done this before.

688
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:11,090
So Mrs. Summer, when was your last period?

689
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:31,050
"This is the best news of my life."

690
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:39,690
"It has made my heart rejoice."

691
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:44,170
"This means..."

692
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:48,330
"A guest is going to come."

693
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:52,250
"This means..."

694
00:34:52,410 --> 00:34:56,850
"Its time to celebrate."

695
00:34:57,010 --> 00:35:01,050
- "This means..."
- I am going to be the mother of your child!

696
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:04,850
"A guest is going to come."

697
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:08,570
"This means..."

698
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:13,410
"I have hit a jackpot."

699
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:26,370
"It's time to bid farewell
to regrets and welcome good luck."

700
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:28,410
"God has been generous."

701
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:34,090
"My prayers have been answered."

702
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:36,250
"Everything seems fragrant."

703
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:38,330
"Everywhere there are celebrations."

704
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:43,490
"My happiness knows no bounds."

705
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:04,770
Congratulations.

706
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:06,210
Huh?

707
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:09,250
The pregnancy strip was right.

708
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:11,050
She's pregnant.

709
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:12,570
Congratulations.

710
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:21,330
Oh, my God!

711
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,050
Oh, my God!

712
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:27,090
I love you.

713
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:29,970
Congratulations.

714
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:31,090
Congratulations.

715
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:33,090
We're gonna be a mom and dad.

716
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:34,730
I love you so much.

717
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:36,530
Oh!

718
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:45,690
Mimi, thank you.

719
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:47,860
You've changed our lives.

720
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:51,410
- Thank you so much.
- Welcome.

721
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:53,410
No, not welcome.

722
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:58,570
Bhanu, you too, thank you so much.

723
00:36:58,650 --> 00:36:59,330
- 2 million!
- No problem, sir.

724
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:01,330
Cash okay, cheque okay, no tax.

725
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:03,490
Yes, yes, of course.
Of course, don't worry about it.

726
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:04,570
Don't worry.

727
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:06,090
We did it.

728
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:11,570
Doctor, thank you.

729
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:12,610
Most welcome.

730
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:14,450
I'll see you soon?

731
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:21,810
We are so happy, Mimi.

732
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:25,010
Then how about making me happy as well?

733
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:25,610
- Yes!
- Oh!

734
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:27,490
- Yes, yes.
- Yeah. Yeah.

735
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:33,530
Mimi, this is for you.

736
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:34,490
- No.
- Hey!

737
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:36,050
- For her.
- Yeah.

738
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:39,210
This is for you.

739
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:40,530
Thank you.

740
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:44,730
And this is for the next four months.

741
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:48,410
We'll pay you the rest after we come back.

742
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:50,130
- Come back?
- Where are you going?

743
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:52,570
We are going back to America.

744
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:56,250
We need to get back to work
since we're becoming parents.

745
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:57,850
Need the money, right?

746
00:37:58,010 --> 00:37:59,210
Need the money.

747
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:00,330
Don't worry.

748
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:02,370
I'm around to make
sure you don't face any problems.

749
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:04,170
We are fine even if you don't!

750
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:05,330
We can manage on our own.

751
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:06,490
- We don't need him.
- No, no, no.

752
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:07,970
Bhanu is here to take care of you.

753
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:10,010
I'll always stay in touch with Bhanu.

754
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:12,410
So please, let him stay.

755
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:14,530
It's their flower
nurturing in your garden.

756
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:17,250
Let me do the job of the gardener, okay?

757
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:19,570
Take care. Sister.

758
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:20,730
Okay?

759
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:21,970
Come here.

760
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:24,730
What will you tell your parents?

761
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:26,530
We should go or we are
not going to make the flight.

762
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:27,610
- Okay?
- No problem, ma'am.

763
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:29,250
John sir, Summer ma'am, come.

764
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,010
A movie shoot?

765
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:35,610
For nine months?

766
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:37,170
For that long?

767
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:38,850
Seems like a very big movie.

768
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:40,450
It is, Mom.

769
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:41,490
It's four hours long.

770
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:42,490
Four hours?

771
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:43,810
What's the name of the movie?

772
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:45,090
- The name?
- Yes.

773
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:47,490
"Love in the middle of the sea."

774
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:49,090
In the middle of the sea, huh?

775
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:50,330
Right.

776
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:51,690
What will they do
in the middle of the sea?

777
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:53,010
Love.

778
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:55,450
- Love.
- I see.

779
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:56,210
Let me explain.

780
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:58,650
- We will be shooting on a big ship.
- Okay.

781
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:02,810
The ship will stay in the sea
for nine months while we keep filming.

782
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:04,450
Haven't they already made a similar movie,

783
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:07,490
where the ship sinks and everyone
dies in the end?

784
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:08,130
Huh?

785
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:09,330
No, no, no.

786
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:10,370
No one is dying in this movie.

787
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:11,650
No one is dying in this movie, Dad.

788
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:15,850
As soon as the ship docks,
the parents give them their blessings,

789
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:17,130
and the girl and the boy get married.

790
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:18,530
The end, happy ending.

791
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:20,250
Very good.

792
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:21,490
- Isn't it?
- It's a good story, isn't it?

793
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:23,130
No?

794
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:25,010
No.

795
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:27,450
You cannot go.

796
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:29,370
Why not?

797
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:30,410
No.

798
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:33,410
You don't need to do this.

799
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:37,970
Boys from decent families don't
like girls who work in the movies.

800
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:40,490
Mom, once I become a star,

801
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:42,450
Then I will pick and choose
the guy I want to marry.

802
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:44,250
- Is it?
- Of course.

803
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:46,650
And look at this!

804
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:49,450
They have already given me an advance.

805
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:52,050
They are going pay me handsomely.

806
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:53,490
Think about it.

807
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:55,450
I'll be a movie star.

808
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:58,530
Huge posters of me everywhere.

809
00:39:58,610 --> 00:39:59,810
I'll be on TV.

810
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:01,130
I'll do interviews.

811
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:03,090
Mine?

812
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:06,050
Of course,
they will interview you as well.

813
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:08,170
You'll be on TV as well.

814
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:17,970
Then I'll tell everyone how
great our art and our lineage is.

815
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:18,810
Yes, you should.

816
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:19,770
- Right?
- Right.

817
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:20,610
No.

818
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:21,730
Sit down.

819
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:23,450
Okay.
Sit down.

820
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:25,970
Mom!

821
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:27,410
Come on, just think about it.

822
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:30,130
We will renovate
our house every year.

823
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:31,010
Every year!

824
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:34,050
You'll be surrounded by servants.

825
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:38,130
Who will be forever at your command

826
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:41,010
Please let me do this.

827
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:42,730
Please let me go.

828
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:44,450
Don't ask me.

829
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:47,530
You and your father can do as you please.

830
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:50,210
Fine.

831
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:54,170
But only under one condition.

832
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:55,410
What condition?

833
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:58,330
You'll use your full name.

834
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:01,330
Mimi Maansingh Rathore.

835
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:04,010
Of course, I will!

836
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:29,530
Shama!

837
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:30,570
Salaam Alaikum. [Greetings]

838
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:32,330
Walaikum salaam. [Greetings]

839
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:35,290
Where are your guests from?

840
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:39,810
You know my aunt in Kalyan?

841
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:41,250
Your aunt in Kalyan?

842
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:45,050
The one who had grey
hair from a very young age?

843
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:48,850
Yes, I remember her.

844
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:53,570
The one who wears body
fitted dresses, right?

845
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:55,970
Right.

846
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:58,010
This is her niece.

847
00:41:58,970 --> 00:41:59,810
Chand.

848
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:01,530
Salaam. [Greetings]

849
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:02,570
What did you say her name was?

850
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:04,090
- Chand.
- Chand.

851
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:05,450
And this is her husband.

852
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:07,610
Naseeruddin.

853
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:08,450
Salaam Walaikum. [Greetings]

854
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:09,650
Walaikum salaam. [Greetings]

855
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:10,610
Walaikum salaam. [Greetings]

856
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:12,210
What do you do?

857
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:13,530
I'm a driver.

858
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:15,530
With God's grace, I own my own car.

859
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:18,210
<i>Praise Lord Ram</i>

860
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:22,410
A second-hand car.

861
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:24,450
I have a new project underway.

862
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:25,650
Ill buy a new car soon.

863
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:28,330
- See you around.
- Okay.

864
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:29,690
Let me know if you
have contacts at the bank.

865
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:30,810
Sure. Always happy to help.

866
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:33,050
We are family.
Family always helps each other.

867
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:38,330
[Prayers]

868
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:40,010
Hey!

869
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:41,650
Morning walk!

870
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:44,250
Get up!

871
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:45,010
Get up!

872
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:45,970
Come on guys!

873
00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:54,050
Mimi... wakey-wakey.

874
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:58,370
Mimi, come on, wake up.

875
00:42:58,450 --> 00:42:59,890
You are supposed to go on morning walks.

876
00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:00,730
Come on, get up.

877
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:02,730
Let's do the morning walk in the evening.

878
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:05,450
Morning walk is good for the baby.

879
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:08,490
You don't do it, let the baby do it.

880
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:12,690
- Get up.
- But the baby wants to sleep.

881
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:13,690
Get up.

882
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:21,050
You look good.

883
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:22,210
Thanks.

884
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:24,850
Put this on.

885
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:28,530
Cover the whole face.

886
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:29,610
This okay?

887
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:30,650
Okay.

888
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:33,410
Salaam Alaikum, Shama. [Greetings]

889
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:35,050
Walaikum salaam. [Greetings]

890
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:36,730
Where are you off to
this early in the morning?

891
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:38,570
Just for a morning walk?

892
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:40,810
Chand is used to it.

893
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:42,010
Oh.

894
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:44,330
You didn't tell me that
Mimi is working in a movie?

895
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:46,490
- In a movie, huh?
- Yeah.

896
00:43:47,010 --> 00:43:48,970
Mimi's father was telling
everyone at the bus depot.

897
00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:51,250
She went to Mumbai to work in the movies.

898
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:52,530
She'll be a movie star soon.

899
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:54,290
I am sure you are aware about this.

900
00:43:54,610 --> 00:43:55,970
Yes, she had told me about it.

901
00:43:57,810 --> 00:43:58,730
Chand?

902
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:01,410
Let's go, Chand.

903
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:08,850
I have to say, Chand is quite tall.

904
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:11,370
She'll need 6 meters
of cloth at the least.

905
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:12,690
Right, anything less
won't suffice.

906
00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:13,690
Hmm?

907
00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:17,850
Who is it?

908
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:22,210
What...

909
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:24,410
Wait.

910
00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:28,450
Fine, break the door.

911
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:31,170
Coming.

912
00:44:34,850 --> 00:44:35,810
Who are you?

913
00:44:37,850 --> 00:44:42,170
I am Shama's aunt's niece's husband.

914
00:44:42,410 --> 00:44:43,690
But who are you?

915
00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:45,290
- Who me?
- Yes.

916
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:46,570
Shama's father.

917
00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:50,970
Oh that's wonderful,
I feel blessed with your presence.

918
00:44:51,050 --> 00:44:52,410
It's so good to finally meet you.

919
00:44:53,530 --> 00:44:54,690
Salaam walaikum. [Greetings]

920
00:44:56,810 --> 00:44:58,130
Walaikum salaam. [Greetings]

921
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:02,210
Can I come in?

922
00:45:02,770 --> 00:45:04,210
Sure.
Welcome to my house.

923
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:05,770
I mean welcome to your house.

924
00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:08,530
I should quickly hide the alcohol.

925
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:17,170
What did you say your name was, mister?

926
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:19,250
- My name?
- Yes.

927
00:45:20,450 --> 00:45:21,410
Nawazuddin.

928
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:23,530
- Nawazuddin?
- Yes.

929
00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:27,410
So you are Zohra Begum's son-in-law?

930
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:29,170
Zohra?

931
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:31,610
No, I'm the son-in-law of the
aunt in Kalyan who wears tight dresses.

932
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:33,170
She is Zohra Begum.

933
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:34,530
Oh, her name is Zohra?

934
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:35,570
I didn't know.

935
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:37,250
I always addressed her as Mom.

936
00:45:37,330 --> 00:45:38,570
Please forgive me, Mom.

937
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:41,210
Where is Shama?

938
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:49,650
Candle?
Extinguished it.

939
00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:51,010
Why would we need it during the day?

940
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:53,210
I am talking about my daughter Shama.

941
00:45:53,290 --> 00:45:57,610
She has gone out with my daughter--
my wife for morning walk.

942
00:45:57,810 --> 00:45:59,170
- Walk?
- Yes.

943
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:01,810
Walk means using your
legs to move forward.

944
00:46:02,290 --> 00:46:03,410
Let me show you.

945
00:46:04,410 --> 00:46:07,290
This is what you'd call a slow walk.

946
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:10,410
This is a fast walk.

947
00:46:11,410 --> 00:46:13,090
Come here, mister.

948
00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:17,410
Please come here.

949
00:46:20,810 --> 00:46:23,410
I know what "walk" means.

950
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:29,170
What I meant was what made
Shama suddenly go on a walk?

951
00:46:30,130 --> 00:46:33,090
My wife is used to going on morning walks.

952
00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:34,410
Doctor has advised it too.

953
00:46:35,450 --> 00:46:37,450
One should go on walks regularly.
It's good for the heart.

954
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:41,330
Do you read Namaaz [Prayers]?

955
00:46:41,410 --> 00:46:43,850
Yes, of course I do.
I read it quite often. I love it.

956
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:45,170
How many times do you read it?

957
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:46,290
10 times.

958
00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:48,970
One reads Namaaz only
five times in day, mister.

959
00:46:49,050 --> 00:46:50,770
I gave you a count for two days.

960
00:46:51,330 --> 00:46:54,170
Did you read the Morning Namaaz
for the day?

961
00:46:57,410 --> 00:46:58,970
I'll read it after I have a bath.

962
00:46:59,410 --> 00:47:02,330
It is read at five in the morning.

963
00:47:02,410 --> 00:47:03,850
I'll read it tomorrow morning at five.

964
00:47:04,010 --> 00:47:06,010
Oh good lord, this guy...!

965
00:47:06,730 --> 00:47:08,370
I'm a heart patient.

966
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:10,370
Can I lie down for a bit?
My heart's palpitating.

967
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:12,450
Yes, of course.
You should rest.

968
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:28,610
Look at him, he's still sleeping.

969
00:47:28,690 --> 00:47:30,050
- Shama.
- Dad!

970
00:47:31,290 --> 00:47:33,050
Thank God you came.

971
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:35,690
When did they come?

972
00:47:35,970 --> 00:47:39,050
You remember the aunty from Kalyan?
Who wears tight dresses?

973
00:47:40,170 --> 00:47:42,330
Why does everyone keep telling
me about the way she dresses!

974
00:47:42,770 --> 00:47:43,850
No?

975
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:47,010
I asked, when did they get here.

976
00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:48,130
Yesterday.

977
00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:49,610
This is Chand.

978
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:50,650
Salaam. [Greetings]

979
00:47:50,730 --> 00:47:51,370
Salaam. [Greetings]

980
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:52,410
She is pregnant.

981
00:47:52,650 --> 00:47:53,250
Okay.

982
00:47:53,330 --> 00:47:54,330
She was just a baby
when she had come here.

983
00:47:54,410 --> 00:47:55,410
Do you remember?

984
00:47:56,170 --> 00:48:00,090
You don't talk to anyone,
so you don't know anything.

985
00:48:01,090 --> 00:48:05,290
Well, she was finding it difficult
at her house so I asked her to come here.

986
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:06,530
Dad, I did the right thing, didn't I?

987
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:08,530
Yes, you did the right thing.

988
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:11,690
This must be God's will.

989
00:48:11,770 --> 00:48:14,330
- Right.
- Zohra Begum has done a lot for us.

990
00:48:15,570 --> 00:48:19,650
You go have a bath,
then accompany me to the Mosque.

991
00:48:20,250 --> 00:48:21,770
We'll read the Afternoon Namaaz there.

993
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:35,610

a gum that gets stuck to the gums."

998

999
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:06,090

1000
00:49:06,170 --> 00:49:12,610

door of my heart so hard."

"You are a mystery,"

"Oh Sparkler..."

1011

"You are a hormonal mess."

"Oh Sparkler..."

1013

Look at you!

1033
00:51:44,170 --> 00:51:46,410
You look more
beautiful than before, Mimi.

1034
00:51:46,490 --> 00:51:47,290
Right?

1035
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:49,810
Want to see something fun?

1036
00:51:50,130 --> 00:51:51,050
Touch here.

1037
00:51:58,410 --> 00:51:59,330
Oh.

Oh, do you feel it?
That's our baby.

1040
00:52:09,450 --> 00:52:11,650
I've never felt anything like that before.

1041

That's our baby.

1042
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:15,730
Make us also feel like never before.

Huh?

00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:17,690
Oh.

Yeah.

I'm sure its are all there.

1053
00:52:37,170 --> 00:52:38,290
Okay, yeah.

1054
00:52:38,410 --> 00:52:38,810
Good.

1055
00:52:38,890 --> 00:52:39,690
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

1056
00:52:39,770 --> 00:52:41,210
I have put on some weight, haven't I?

1057
00:52:41,810 --> 00:52:42,930
- No?
- Good take care, sir.

1058
00:52:43,010 --> 00:52:44,090

You're gonna be a great mom.

1062

Oh.

1063
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:08,210
Hey, Doctor.

1064
00:53:08,290 --> 00:53:09,330
Hello.

1065
00:53:11,850 --> 00:53:12,610
Please sit.

1066
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:13,690
Okay.

1067
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:25,850
We had some doubts
after the last check-up,

1068
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:28,810
so we did a battery
of tests on Mimi yesterday.

1069
00:53:29,850 --> 00:53:30,970
What's wrong, Doctor?

1070
00:53:32,850 --> 00:53:34,290
There is a problem with your child.

1071
00:53:38,850 --> 00:53:41,050
Your child is mentally challenged.

1072
00:53:44,410 --> 00:53:45,810
Your child has down syndrome.

1073
00:53:47,170 --> 00:53:48,090
What?

1074
00:53:49,450 --> 00:53:51,130
That's what the reports say.

1075
00:53:51,410 --> 00:53:53,650
I'm-- I'm really very sorry.

1076
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:58,690
I know it's very hard for you
to accept it, but it happens sometimes.

1077
00:53:59,850 --> 00:54:03,050
No matter how much care you
take of yourself or your child,

1078
00:54:03,850 --> 00:54:06,450
your child turns out to be disabled.

1079
00:54:08,410 --> 00:54:09,570
Can't you fix it, Doctor?

1080
00:54:10,090 --> 00:54:14,970
What any hospital can do is provide
you with medical care and a specialist--

1081
00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:16,130
Summer, wait.

1082
00:54:16,410 --> 00:54:17,330
Wait, Doctor.

1083
00:54:17,410 --> 00:54:18,330
Summer!

No, I can't.

No, I can't.

1091

00:54:59,690 --> 00:55:01,450
Please, let's go home.

1094
00:55:02,650 --> 00:55:04,090
What's wrong, Summer ji?

1095
00:55:06,410 --> 00:55:07,410
What happen?

1096
00:55:07,650 --> 00:55:09,650
Bhanu, take us to Mimi.

1097
00:55:09,730 --> 00:55:10,410
What?

1098
00:55:10,530 --> 00:55:12,650
No, no, no, I can't.

1099
00:55:12,730 --> 00:55:14,810
I can't face her, John.
Please no.

1100
00:55:15,330 --> 00:55:16,170
No.

1101
00:55:18,250 --> 00:55:19,970
- I can't.
- What happen?

1102
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:20,770
What happen?

1103
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:21,970
Bhanu, pull over.

1104
00:55:22,410 --> 00:55:23,410
No.

1105
00:55:24,970 --> 00:55:26,130
You don't want the baby?

1106
00:55:28,130 --> 00:55:29,130
Have you lost it?

1107
00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:30,290
You think this is a game?

1108
00:55:30,370 --> 00:55:31,290
Bhanu.

1109
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:37,050
We can't raise this child.

1110
00:55:38,850 --> 00:55:42,410
You think money can
buy you everything, right?

1111
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:43,770
You think this is a poor country,

1112
00:55:43,850 --> 00:55:45,810
just throw some cash and
we will do anything?

1113
00:55:45,890 --> 00:55:46,730
No.

1114
00:55:47,130 --> 00:55:50,570
Bhanu that is not how we think.

1115
00:55:51,130 --> 00:55:53,570
We have been touring India for a year now.

1116
00:55:54,170 --> 00:55:56,450
We have visited many surrogacy clinics.

1117
00:55:57,050 --> 00:55:58,290
You know why?

1118
00:55:59,050 --> 00:56:04,010
Because-- because we
wanted a perfect surrogate,

1119
00:56:04,090 --> 00:56:06,810
so that we get a perfect
and a healthy baby.

1120
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:10,290
Not a disabled one.

1121
00:56:10,410 --> 00:56:12,690
Not-- not a baby with down syndrome.

1122
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:16,410
What will we do with such a child, Bhanu?

1123
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:19,090
And what will that
girl do with that child?

1124
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:21,210
It is your baby.

1125
00:56:21,410 --> 00:56:22,770
You have to keep it, no matter how it is.

1126
00:56:23,810 --> 00:56:27,290
My wife and I would've treasured
the child if it had been ours.

1127
00:56:27,490 --> 00:56:29,170
Bhanu, please understand.

1128
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:31,050
We can't raise a disabled baby.

1129
00:56:31,130 --> 00:56:32,210
We just can't.

1130
00:56:32,530 --> 00:56:33,690
We can't.

1131
00:56:35,090 --> 00:56:36,810
Don't ask us to keep this baby.

1132
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:41,970
I request you.

1133
00:56:42,450 --> 00:56:47,770
Please tell Mimi...
to get rid of the baby.

1134
00:56:48,090 --> 00:56:49,010
- I can't.
- Please don't say that.

1135
00:56:49,090 --> 00:56:50,050
No.

1136
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:52,050
- Summer ji?
- No.

1137
00:56:54,290 --> 00:56:55,290
John sir?

1138
00:56:55,970 --> 00:56:57,170
Sir, I request you.

1139
00:56:59,210 --> 00:57:01,290
I request you, please take your baby.

1140
00:57:02,090 --> 00:57:03,170
Take your baby.

1141
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:07,570
This isn't what we wanted, Bhanu.

1142
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:28,010
I'll find you a place in Juhu,
that's where all the movie stars stay.

1143
00:57:28,090 --> 00:57:29,170
Right.

1144
00:57:29,570 --> 00:57:30,850
Find a nice house.

1145
00:57:31,010 --> 00:57:32,090
It should be sea facing.

1146
00:57:32,170 --> 00:57:33,170
- Sea facing?
- Yes.

1147
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:35,090
You know how expensive it will be?

1148
00:57:35,170 --> 00:57:36,090
You don't say!

1149
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:38,810
You don't need to worry about the money,
Jolly Brother.

1150
00:57:38,970 --> 00:57:40,810
Shama and I will be
there in a couple of months.

1151
00:57:40,970 --> 00:57:45,530
Listen, let's make Shama
sing in our viral video, yeah?

1152
00:57:45,610 --> 00:57:47,410
She is a great singer.

1153
00:57:47,570 --> 00:57:49,170
You should have a word with Bhushan ji.

1154
00:57:49,250 --> 00:57:50,450
I'll talk to him and get back to you.

1155
00:57:50,570 --> 00:57:51,330
Okay.

1156
00:57:51,410 --> 00:57:53,130
Don't forget to send
me pictures of the house.

1157
00:57:53,410 --> 00:57:54,650
Right.
Okay, bye.

1158
00:57:56,170 --> 00:57:57,050
Bhanu!

1159
00:57:57,410 --> 00:57:59,090
You too should come to Mumbai with us.

1160
00:57:59,690 --> 00:58:00,970
You can be my driver.

1161
00:58:01,050 --> 00:58:02,610
We will have loads of fun, right?

1162
00:58:02,690 --> 00:58:03,730
Right.

1163
00:58:04,850 --> 00:58:05,690
What's wrong?

1164
00:58:06,290 --> 00:58:07,450
Why this sad face?

1165
00:58:08,330 --> 00:58:09,410
What happened?

1166
00:58:14,850 --> 00:58:17,410
Summer ji said that
she doesn't want the baby.

1167
00:58:18,330 --> 00:58:19,730
What do you mean by
she doesn't want the baby?

1168
00:58:20,010 --> 00:58:21,090
Are you high or what?

1169
00:58:23,410 --> 00:58:29,050
Doctor's reports state that
there is a problem with the child.

1170
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:31,650
Problem?

1171
00:58:32,290 --> 00:58:33,330
Problem?

1172
00:58:33,410 --> 00:58:34,730
What's the problem?

1173
00:58:36,410 --> 00:58:37,050
What's the problem?

1174
00:58:37,130 --> 00:58:38,330
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.

1175
00:58:39,690 --> 00:58:43,650
She has asked you to abort the child.

1176
00:58:45,410 --> 00:58:46,690
Abort the child?

1177
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:48,610
Have you lost it, Bhanu?

1178
00:58:49,170 --> 00:58:50,250
Are you out of your mind?

1179
00:58:50,530 --> 00:58:53,090
- Let me call Summer.
- How can she say that?

1180
00:58:53,610 --> 00:58:55,410
She is carrying their child, Bhanu.

1181
00:58:56,090 --> 00:58:57,410
I cannot get through.

1182
00:58:57,810 --> 00:58:58,650
They agreed to this.

1183
00:58:58,730 --> 00:59:00,450
We did this for them.
How can she say that?

1184
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:02,570
I cannot get through her phone!

1185
00:59:02,650 --> 00:59:03,570
Where is Summer?

1186
00:59:03,650 --> 00:59:05,250
I just dropped them to their hotel.

1187
00:59:06,610 --> 00:59:07,570
Get out of my way.

1188
00:59:07,650 --> 00:59:08,530
Mimi!

1189
00:59:45,490 --> 00:59:48,610
Shama she will run away.

1190
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:54,690
Hurry up.

1191
00:59:59,610 --> 01:00:01,250
Hurry up, Bhanu.

1192
01:00:24,330 --> 01:00:26,290
Where are John and Summer?

1193
01:00:26,410 --> 01:00:28,130
They just checked out and left.

1194
01:00:28,210 --> 01:00:29,810
They left?

1195
01:00:30,330 --> 01:00:31,450
Where did they go?

1196
01:00:32,010 --> 01:00:33,010
Mimi!

1197
01:01:32,970 --> 01:01:34,730
[Indistinct Chatter]

1198
01:01:39,690 --> 01:01:42,090
What have you done!

1199
01:01:43,290 --> 01:01:46,650
What kind of a movie
were you shooting for?

1200
01:01:50,410 --> 01:01:51,810
I told you not to send her.

1201
01:01:53,450 --> 01:01:55,090
But you wouldn't listen to me.

1202
01:01:56,570 --> 01:01:58,810
Now make her use her full name!

1203
01:02:02,410 --> 01:02:05,970
Shama, you have committed
a sin by hiding this from us.

1204
01:02:06,450 --> 01:02:09,170
We treated you like our own
daughter and you betrayed us.

1205
01:02:10,290 --> 01:02:13,090
This is how you repay
him for teaching you everything?

1206
01:02:22,450 --> 01:02:24,450
What did you tell us, Mimi?

1207
01:02:27,690 --> 01:02:30,770
"I'll make my family proud, Dad."

1208
01:02:31,530 --> 01:02:34,130
"Everyone will learn about our art."

1209
01:02:35,410 --> 01:02:38,450
You have destroyed our family's name.

1210
01:02:39,410 --> 01:02:44,570
You have ruined everything,
my art, my honour, my reputation.

1211
01:02:51,210 --> 01:02:53,410
You have broken my trust.

1212
01:02:56,010 --> 01:02:57,250
Come on, tell me!

1213
01:02:57,330 --> 01:02:59,290
Tell me who the father is!

1214
01:02:59,410 --> 01:03:02,450
Tell me, who is the
man you got married to, huh?

1215
01:03:03,570 --> 01:03:05,850
Don't tell me you didn't get married.

1216
01:03:07,090 --> 01:03:09,410
I will die of shame.

1217
01:03:11,010 --> 01:03:13,850
I'll set this house on
fire along with everything else.

1218
01:03:14,010 --> 01:03:15,250
I'll set everything on fire.

1219
01:03:15,330 --> 01:03:17,010
Who is the father, Mimi?

1220
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:18,090
Why aren't you saying anything?

1221
01:03:18,210 --> 01:03:19,850
Tell me, who is the father?

1222
01:03:19,930 --> 01:03:20,890
Tell us.

1223
01:03:20,970 --> 01:03:22,410
- Tell me!
- He!

1224
01:03:25,330 --> 01:03:26,290
He?

1225
01:03:26,410 --> 01:03:27,410
He?

1226
01:03:27,490 --> 01:03:28,530
He?

1227
01:03:30,250 --> 01:03:31,250
Me?

1228
01:03:31,410 --> 01:03:33,170
You got me into all this.

1229
01:03:34,170 --> 01:03:36,970
You are the one who convinced
me to have this baby.

1230
01:03:37,090 --> 01:03:39,610
Why did you listen to him?

1231
01:03:40,090 --> 01:03:42,170
He is old enough to be your father!

1232
01:03:42,250 --> 01:03:43,330
No.

1233
01:03:43,410 --> 01:03:44,370
I am nowhere close to your age.

1234
01:03:44,450 --> 01:03:45,490
I am just 38 years old.

1235
01:03:45,570 --> 01:03:47,410
How can he be Mimi's husband?

1236
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:48,530
He's a Muslim.

1237
01:03:48,610 --> 01:03:49,610
Huh?

1238
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:53,090
- He's a Muslim?
- He's a Muslim!

1239
01:03:53,450 --> 01:03:54,690
Oh, my God!

1240
01:03:54,770 --> 01:03:56,170
A Muslim?

1241
01:03:59,130 --> 01:04:02,970
Oh God, this is a disaster.

1242
01:04:03,050 --> 01:04:04,170
What have you done!

1243
01:04:04,250 --> 01:04:07,250
I've seen him with his wife.

1244
01:04:08,450 --> 01:04:09,410
His wife?

1245
01:04:10,090 --> 01:04:11,250
His wife?

1246
01:04:11,330 --> 01:04:12,410
His wife?

1247
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:15,450
That was his aunt, not his wife.

1248
01:04:16,410 --> 01:04:19,210
Listen, I am not a Muslim
and I don't have a wife.

1249
01:04:19,290 --> 01:04:20,130
Hang on.

1250
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:21,570
Here.

1251
01:04:23,010 --> 01:04:24,570
Age: 42 years.

1252
01:04:24,650 --> 01:04:25,690
Read my name first.

1253
01:04:25,770 --> 01:04:26,770
All you can see is my age, huh?

1254
01:04:28,010 --> 01:04:29,490
Bhanupratap Pandey.

1255
01:04:30,170 --> 01:04:31,010
He's a Hindu.

1256
01:04:31,210 --> 01:04:32,730
That was a close shave, Aunt.

1257
01:04:33,490 --> 01:04:35,810
That was a close shave, indeed.

1258
01:04:36,450 --> 01:04:39,250
Shobha, you should end this drama now.

1259
01:04:40,050 --> 01:04:42,010
Our daughter is pregnant.

1260
01:04:42,610 --> 01:04:44,090
You should look after her.

1261
01:04:49,850 --> 01:04:52,960
Maansingh, you are the
one who should be blamed for this.

1262
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:55,730
Why did you let her go alone, huh?

1263
01:04:57,010 --> 01:04:58,250
Anyway, we cannot change the past.

1264
01:04:58,330 --> 01:05:00,210
You need to take special care of her now.

1265
01:05:00,650 --> 01:05:03,410
She is expecting a child.

1266
01:05:03,730 --> 01:05:06,410
You will be grandparents.

1267
01:05:07,530 --> 01:05:11,330
Mimi, you too should stop crying.

1268
01:05:11,410 --> 01:05:12,730
Don't cry, my child.

1269
01:05:12,810 --> 01:05:14,410
Wipe your tears, come on.

1270
01:05:14,770 --> 01:05:16,090
You should eat something.

1271
01:05:16,170 --> 01:05:18,970
You should not stay
hungry during a pregnancy.

1272
01:05:19,050 --> 01:05:22,250
Come on, get up.
Come on.

1273
01:05:24,970 --> 01:05:26,210
What will you have?

1274
01:05:26,290 --> 01:05:27,370
Should I make you your favourite meal?

1275
01:05:27,450 --> 01:05:28,530
Would you like to have it?

1276
01:05:28,610 --> 01:05:29,570
Come on, my child.

1277
01:05:52,410 --> 01:05:56,170
Why doesn't Mimi dress
up like a married woman?

1278
01:05:57,450 --> 01:06:00,450
Perhaps he doesn't inspire
her to dress up like a married woman?

1279
01:06:01,970 --> 01:06:05,970
So, do you have a house of your own,

1280
01:06:06,730 --> 01:06:09,410
or you plan to stay here with us?

1281
01:06:41,250 --> 01:06:42,610
This is not right, Mimi ji!

1282
01:06:44,130 --> 01:06:46,130
I have a mother,
a wife and a house in Delhi.

1283
01:06:46,210 --> 01:06:47,090
Why did you get me into this mess?

1284
01:06:47,170 --> 01:06:48,170
You rascal!

1285
01:06:48,450 --> 01:06:49,650
I got you into a mess, huh?

1286
01:06:49,730 --> 01:06:51,570
I got you into a mess
or was it vice-versa?

1287
01:06:51,850 --> 01:06:53,250
What had you told me, huh?

1288
01:06:53,490 --> 01:06:54,650
"You should do it, Mimi ji."

1289
01:06:54,730 --> 01:06:56,210
"It's just a matter of nine months."

1290
01:06:56,290 --> 01:06:57,970
"All your dreams will come true."

1291
01:06:58,810 --> 01:06:59,810
"They are very nice people."

1292
01:06:59,970 --> 01:07:01,330
Nice, my foot!

1293
01:07:01,410 --> 01:07:03,410
They are nice people, huh?

1294
01:07:04,530 --> 01:07:05,970
"John ji! Summer ji!"

1295
01:07:06,090 --> 01:07:07,450
What happened, huh?
Where are they now, huh?

1296
01:07:07,530 --> 01:07:09,410
Where are they?
They ran away!

1297
01:07:10,410 --> 01:07:11,770
Leaving me alone with this baby!

1298
01:07:13,810 --> 01:07:15,450
What example had you given me, huh?

1299
01:07:16,130 --> 01:07:18,010
"You just need to grow
their sugarcane in your farm."

1300
01:07:18,850 --> 01:07:22,530
I want to shove all
those sugarcanes up yours!

1301
01:07:24,450 --> 01:07:26,610
Say something, Bhanupratap Pandey.

1302
01:07:29,010 --> 01:07:32,210
You better take care of
this baby once its born.

1303
01:07:32,970 --> 01:07:34,490
I won't keep it.
Got it?

1304
01:07:36,410 --> 01:07:38,130
You've ruined my life.

1305
01:07:41,690 --> 01:07:43,850
Why did I listen to you?

1306
01:07:56,970 --> 01:07:59,010
You should go to Mumbai.
Become an actor.

1307
01:07:59,410 --> 01:08:00,490
I'll take care of the baby.

1308
01:08:00,570 --> 01:08:02,170
And what will you tell people?

1309
01:08:03,690 --> 01:08:07,330
Where were these people when my
husband divorced me?

1310
01:08:11,530 --> 01:08:12,810
Don't worry.

1311
01:08:13,610 --> 01:08:15,090
I'll handle it.

1312
01:08:29,570 --> 01:08:30,530
Aatif?

1313
01:08:30,610 --> 01:08:31,410
Yes?

1314
01:08:32,210 --> 01:08:33,490
Mimi's husband--

1315
01:08:33,570 --> 01:08:34,730
Your son-in-law?

1316
01:08:35,130 --> 01:08:35,970
Right.

1317
01:08:37,050 --> 01:08:38,650
When do you think they met?

1318
01:08:39,250 --> 01:08:40,610
When did they get married?

1319
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:44,730
He must've bamboozled Mimi
during one of her dance performances.

1320
01:08:45,530 --> 01:08:48,530
I don't see her falling in
love with a two-bit driver otherwise.

1321
01:08:48,610 --> 01:08:49,450
Hmm.

1322
01:08:50,090 --> 01:08:52,330
He must have done some black magic on her.

1323
01:08:53,530 --> 01:08:54,450
Mimi!

1324
01:08:55,610 --> 01:08:56,450
Mimi!

1325
01:08:56,530 --> 01:08:57,570
Shobha!

1326
01:08:57,770 --> 01:08:58,850
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong?

1327
01:08:59,010 --> 01:09:00,530
I don't know what's wrong.
It just hurts a lot.

1328
01:09:00,610 --> 01:09:01,770
You are in pain?

1329
01:09:01,850 --> 01:09:03,170
What's wrong?

1330
01:09:03,290 --> 01:09:04,690
Let's take her to the doctor.

1331
01:09:04,770 --> 01:09:05,810
I'll go call the neighbourhood doctor.

1332
01:09:05,970 --> 01:09:06,770
Yes, call him.

1333
01:09:06,850 --> 01:09:08,570
No, her doctor is in Jaipur.

1334
01:09:08,650 --> 01:09:10,250
She knows her case quite well.
We will have to go there.

1335
01:09:10,330 --> 01:09:11,330
Wear this, dear.

1336
01:09:11,410 --> 01:09:12,570
Come on, my child.

1337
01:09:13,530 --> 01:09:14,290
Take your time.

1338
01:09:14,370 --> 01:09:14,970
Be careful.

1339
01:09:15,050 --> 01:09:15,410
Be careful.

1340
01:09:15,490 --> 01:09:16,330
I'll come with you.

1341
01:09:16,410 --> 01:09:17,210
No!

1342
01:09:17,290 --> 01:09:18,170
You guys stay here.

1343
01:09:18,250 --> 01:09:18,850
We'll go there alone.

1344
01:09:18,930 --> 01:09:20,370
Right, no one will come with us.

1345
01:09:20,450 --> 01:09:21,250
Shut up!

1346
01:09:21,410 --> 01:09:22,330
We will all go with her.

1347
01:09:22,410 --> 01:09:23,610
Right, we will all go with her.

1348
01:09:23,810 --> 01:09:25,690
We've had enough.
We are done listening to you.

1349
01:09:25,770 --> 01:09:26,730
Let's go.

1350
01:09:31,210 --> 01:09:33,370
Calm down.
Take deep breaths.

1351
01:09:33,450 --> 01:09:35,090
- Drive faster.
- Okay.

1352
01:09:36,730 --> 01:09:37,530
Ouch!

1353
01:09:37,810 --> 01:09:38,650
Watch it.

1354
01:09:38,970 --> 01:09:39,730
Huh?

1355
01:09:41,250 --> 01:09:43,530
Relax, my baby, try to relax.

1356
01:09:55,290 --> 01:09:56,330
It stopped.

1357
01:09:56,450 --> 01:09:57,330
It stopped?

1358
01:09:57,410 --> 01:09:58,010
What stopped?

1359
01:09:58,090 --> 01:09:58,970
The pain.

1360
01:09:59,090 --> 01:10:00,090
- The pain stopped?
- Yes, it stopped.

1361
01:10:00,170 --> 01:10:01,210
She is no longer in pain.

1362
01:10:01,290 --> 01:10:02,450
- You are feeling okay?
- Turn the car around.

1363
01:10:02,620 --> 01:10:03,090
Home?

1364
01:10:03,170 --> 01:10:04,290
Take us home.

1365
01:10:04,410 --> 01:10:05,410
- I am feeling better.
- Okay.

1366
01:10:05,490 --> 01:10:06,330
It stopped.

1367
01:10:09,810 --> 01:10:11,170
Relax, relax.

1368
01:10:11,730 --> 01:10:13,010
- It stopped, right?
- Yes.

1369
01:10:13,090 --> 01:10:14,250
It stopped?

1370
01:10:14,330 --> 01:10:15,610
- Take us home.
- Okay.

1371
01:10:18,450 --> 01:10:19,810
Mimi, are you feeling okay now?

1372
01:10:21,450 --> 01:10:22,210
Ouch!

1373
01:10:22,290 --> 01:10:22,690
What happened?

1374
01:10:22,770 --> 01:10:23,730
It's back! It's back! It's back!

1375
01:10:23,810 --> 01:10:24,570
The pain is back.

1376
01:10:24,650 --> 01:10:25,490
It's back.

1377
01:10:25,570 --> 01:10:27,410
- Turn the car around.
- Turn the car around, hurry up.

1378
01:10:27,850 --> 01:10:29,130
Turn the car around.

1379
01:10:30,210 --> 01:10:31,290
Why don't you drive?

1380
01:10:31,410 --> 01:10:33,650
No, you drive.

1381
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:34,970
It takes time.

1382
01:10:35,170 --> 01:10:35,770
It'll all be good.

1383
01:10:35,850 --> 01:10:36,650
It's all good. It's all good.

1384
01:10:36,730 --> 01:10:38,210
- It'll all be good.
- Right.

1385
01:10:41,970 --> 01:10:42,690
Come.

1386
01:10:43,170 --> 01:10:43,810
Follow me.

1387
01:10:45,410 --> 01:10:46,410
Doctor!

1388
01:10:46,610 --> 01:10:48,410
- She is in a lot of pain.
- Yes.

1389
01:10:49,010 --> 01:10:50,090
Where's the mother?

1390
01:10:51,770 --> 01:10:53,130
What do you mean by where's the mother?

1391
01:10:53,610 --> 01:10:54,690
She is carrying the baby,

1392
01:10:54,770 --> 01:10:56,170
so isn't it obvious that she's the mother?

1393
01:10:56,250 --> 01:10:57,530
Are you sure she's a doctor?

1394
01:10:57,810 --> 01:10:59,210
She's the surrogate.

1395
01:10:59,290 --> 01:11:00,170
Huh?

1396
01:11:00,450 --> 01:11:01,290
Rubbish.

1397
01:11:01,410 --> 01:11:02,530
She is Mimi.

1398
01:11:03,090 --> 01:11:04,610
Or did you change your name as well?

1399
01:11:06,250 --> 01:11:07,330
Surrogate means...

1400
01:11:08,730 --> 01:11:10,410
Doctor, it's hurting really bad.

1401
01:11:10,490 --> 01:11:11,730
Please examine her quickly.

1402
01:11:11,810 --> 01:11:13,090
Nurse, take her inside.

1403
01:11:13,170 --> 01:11:13,850
- Come on.
- Let's go.

1404
01:11:15,210 --> 01:11:16,210
All of you wait here.

1405
01:11:16,290 --> 01:11:17,650
No, we will go with her.

1406
01:11:17,730 --> 01:11:19,210
The doctor has asked us to wait here,
all of us.

1407
01:11:19,290 --> 01:11:20,090
Let her go.

1408
01:11:20,170 --> 01:11:20,690
No, no, no.

1409
01:11:20,770 --> 01:11:21,850
- No one is allowed in there.
- Mimi?

1410
01:11:22,690 --> 01:11:23,610
False labour pains.

1411
01:11:24,450 --> 01:11:26,450
It's known as Braxton-Hicks contractions.

1412
01:11:27,330 --> 01:11:29,410
It is very common during
this time of pregnancy.

1413
01:11:29,570 --> 01:11:30,610
Where is Summer?

1414
01:11:32,090 --> 01:11:33,090
She ran away,

1415
01:11:34,170 --> 01:11:36,410
because you told her that
there is some problem with this baby.

1416
01:11:40,310 --> 01:11:42,450
Oh God, why do people do such things?

1417
01:11:44,050 --> 01:11:45,970
How many times has this
happened before, Doctor?

1418
01:11:47,770 --> 01:11:49,770
In the past few years,
in many surrogacy cases,

1419
01:11:49,850 --> 01:11:51,970
parents have refused to accept the baby.

1420
01:11:52,410 --> 01:11:56,010
They run away, especially the foreigners.

1421
01:11:57,410 --> 01:12:01,010
In such cases,
most of the girls abort the child.

1422
01:12:03,730 --> 01:12:05,610
Doctor, from what I have felt,

1423
01:12:08,130 --> 01:12:10,330
I believe that the
child inside me is alive.

1424
01:12:11,570 --> 01:12:13,970
It grows, it breathes,

1425
01:12:14,090 --> 01:12:16,530
it eats, it moves.

1426
01:12:17,210 --> 01:12:19,170
I think it can also hear us.

1427
01:12:21,210 --> 01:12:23,210
Then why is it ok to kill
a baby on the inside,

1428
01:12:23,650 --> 01:12:27,420
When it is a crime on the outside?

1429
01:12:30,810 --> 01:12:33,530
Why don't people accept the
child inside?

1430
01:12:35,070 --> 01:12:40,210
Irrespective of its condition.
A child is a child right?

1431
01:12:41,530 --> 01:12:42,690
Hmm?

1432
01:13:03,850 --> 01:13:05,170
"You seem..."

1433
01:13:07,170 --> 01:13:08,570
"Like..."

1434
01:13:10,570 --> 01:13:15,810
"Yourself..."

1435
01:13:17,170 --> 01:13:22,530
"But this..."

1436
01:13:23,530 --> 01:13:27,410
"Is not you..."

1437
01:13:30,850 --> 01:13:34,330
"Your face..."

1438
01:13:35,850 --> 01:13:38,330
"smiles,"

1439
01:13:40,090 --> 01:13:42,970
"But it doesn't reach..."

1440
01:13:43,810 --> 01:13:46,410
"your eyes,"

1441
01:13:48,010 --> 01:13:50,610
"Who'd understand..."

1442
01:13:51,730 --> 01:13:54,410
"your pain?"

1443
01:13:55,970 --> 01:14:02,970
Who will set you free?"

1444
01:14:03,570 --> 01:14:07,410
"Set you free..."

1445
01:14:07,650 --> 01:14:11,530
"Set you free..."

1446
01:14:11,610 --> 01:14:14,810
"Set you free..."

1447
01:14:15,610 --> 01:14:19,530
"Set you free..."

1448
01:14:23,970 --> 01:14:26,850
"Why did your aspirations..."

1449
01:14:27,730 --> 01:14:29,770
"End..."

1450
01:14:31,650 --> 01:14:34,450
"All your desires..."

1451
01:14:35,610 --> 01:14:39,530
"are locked away?"

1452
01:14:39,770 --> 01:14:46,090
"All your dreams..."

1453
01:14:47,610 --> 01:14:50,450
"fade away..."

1454
01:14:51,610 --> 01:14:54,850
"And are wiped clean"

1455
01:14:56,650 --> 01:15:03,210
"The waves dont reach the shore"

1456
01:15:03,570 --> 01:15:11,210
"They are upset..."

1457
01:15:11,730 --> 01:15:14,450
"Who'd understand..."

1458
01:15:15,730 --> 01:15:17,770
"your pain?"

1459
01:15:19,810 --> 01:15:27,530
"Who will set you free?"

1460
01:15:27,610 --> 01:15:31,450
"Set you free..."

1461
01:15:31,530 --> 01:15:35,490
"Set you free..."

1462
01:15:35,570 --> 01:15:38,410
"Set you free..."

1463
01:15:39,730 --> 01:15:43,250
"Set you free..."

1464
01:15:51,010 --> 01:15:52,010
Can I ask you something?

1465
01:15:56,090 --> 01:15:58,770
You know that you got me into this mess.

1466
01:16:01,570 --> 01:16:07,410
But even if you ran away.
What could I do?

1467
01:16:08,450 --> 01:16:10,610
I wouldn't have
followed you to Delhi.

1468
01:16:13,770 --> 01:16:17,850
And even if I did,
you could have easily refused to help me.

1469
01:16:20,330 --> 01:16:21,730
This is not your child.

1470
01:16:25,450 --> 01:16:28,530
So why are you still here?

1471
01:16:33,490 --> 01:16:35,010
I am a driver, Mimi ji.

1472
01:16:36,490 --> 01:16:38,290
We have some principles.

1473
01:16:39,970 --> 01:16:45,730
The passenger must always
reach his destination...

1474
01:16:49,410 --> 01:16:54,770
There may be bad roads,
potholes, even accidents,

1475
01:16:56,130 --> 01:17:00,570
but that doesn't give me
an excuse to leave them stranded.

1476
01:17:09,530 --> 01:17:13,210
Okay listen,

1477
01:17:20,210 --> 01:17:24,970
if you experience any
pain during the night,

1478
01:17:26,610 --> 01:17:29,450
then hit me with this bottle.

1479
01:17:30,570 --> 01:17:32,610
You are anyway an expert
at throwing things.

1480
01:17:33,970 --> 01:17:35,410
I have a request,
please don't start screaming.

1481
01:17:35,690 --> 01:17:39,970
My heart starts sinking
and I start feeling scared.

1482
01:17:41,210 --> 01:17:42,130
Hmm?

1483
01:17:42,690 --> 01:17:43,690
I won't scream.

1484
01:17:44,170 --> 01:17:45,290
Okay.

1485
01:17:46,410 --> 01:17:47,610
Good night.

1486
01:17:48,570 --> 01:17:49,570
Good night.

1487
01:17:56,530 --> 01:17:57,530
What's wrong?

1488
01:17:57,610 --> 01:17:59,330
Labour pains!
I'm getting the car.

1489
01:17:59,410 --> 01:18:00,650
Get ready,
we'll have to go to Jaipur.

1490
01:18:01,090 --> 01:18:03,570
Jaipur is too far away.
She'll end up having the baby in the car.

1491
01:18:03,770 --> 01:18:05,410
Let's take her to the
Government Hospital instead.

1492
01:18:05,490 --> 01:18:06,330
Yes.
Let's go.

1493
01:18:06,410 --> 01:18:06,690
Okay.

1494
01:18:06,770 --> 01:18:07,650
- Let's go.
- Madam!

1495
01:18:07,730 --> 01:18:08,970
She is in lot of pain.

1496
01:18:09,090 --> 01:18:11,210
Excuse me, its an emergency.

1497
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:12,010
Let's go.

1498
01:18:12,090 --> 01:18:12,850
Wait here.

1499
01:18:13,010 --> 01:18:14,130
Wait here, all of you.

1500
01:18:14,450 --> 01:18:15,290
Hey...

1501
01:18:19,410 --> 01:18:20,950
She is in so much pain.

1502
01:18:21,030 --> 01:18:21,810
Sit down.

1503
01:18:22,150 --> 01:18:23,650
Please sit down.

1504
01:18:25,230 --> 01:18:26,290
Shama?

1505
01:18:26,450 --> 01:18:28,410
Mimi is in labour.

1506
01:18:28,530 --> 01:18:30,130
We are at the local hospital.

1507
01:18:30,210 --> 01:18:31,290
Come quickly.

1508
01:18:41,730 --> 01:18:42,610
What happened?

1509
01:18:45,210 --> 01:18:46,330
We need you to sign here.

1510
01:18:46,410 --> 01:18:46,810
Who me?

1511
01:18:46,970 --> 01:18:47,570
Yes, you.

1512
01:18:47,690 --> 01:18:48,970
You are the father, right?

1513
01:18:49,250 --> 01:18:50,850
Yes, he is.

1514
01:18:51,410 --> 01:18:52,810
We didn't have much of a choice.

1515
01:18:53,690 --> 01:18:54,730
Sign it.

1516
01:18:54,810 --> 01:18:56,970
I am about to become a father
for the first time. I am so happy.

1517
01:18:57,290 --> 01:18:59,410
My father had become
a grandfather at your age.

1518
01:18:59,490 --> 01:19:01,290
We are against child marriages.

1519
01:19:06,610 --> 01:19:10,330
Push when you feel the pain coming, okay?

1520
01:19:10,490 --> 01:19:11,810
Take deep breaths.

1521
01:19:20,410 --> 01:19:20,770
What's happening?

1522
01:19:20,850 --> 01:19:22,970
They've forbidden us from going in there.

1523
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:24,090
Can't I just--

1524
01:19:24,980 --> 01:19:25,970
Sit down.

1525
01:19:26,050 --> 01:19:27,450
Yes, yes, yes. Relax.

1526
01:19:27,530 --> 01:19:28,370
Yes, yes, yes.

1527
01:19:28,450 --> 01:19:29,490
Calm down, calm down.
We are almost there.

1528
01:19:29,570 --> 01:19:30,770
We are almost there.

1529
01:19:30,850 --> 01:19:32,290
We are almost there.
Calm down, calm down.

1530
01:19:32,410 --> 01:19:33,610
- Relax, relax.
- I can't do it.

1531
01:19:33,690 --> 01:19:35,770
You can do it.

1532
01:19:36,250 --> 01:19:37,850
- You can do it.
- I can't do it.

1533
01:19:37,930 --> 01:19:39,650
Very good. You can do it.

1534
01:19:40,130 --> 01:19:42,330
Push when you feel the pain coming, okay?

1535
01:19:42,410 --> 01:19:44,250
Take deep breaths.

1536
01:19:44,410 --> 01:19:46,690
One more push, come on.

1537
01:19:47,330 --> 01:19:50,010
Yes, yes, yes.

1538
01:19:58,060 --> 01:19:59,170
We are almost there.

1539
01:19:59,250 --> 01:19:59,610
We are almost there.

1540
01:19:59,690 --> 01:20:00,530
Calm down, calm down.

1541
01:20:00,610 --> 01:20:02,690
Relax, relax.

1542
01:20:02,970 --> 01:20:04,250
Push when you feel the pain coming, okay?

1543
01:20:04,330 --> 01:20:05,130
I can't do it.

1544
01:20:05,210 --> 01:20:06,330
You can do it.

1545
01:20:06,410 --> 01:20:08,210
You can do it.

1546
01:20:08,770 --> 01:20:11,210
Take deep breaths. One more push.

1547
01:20:11,410 --> 01:20:12,570
Yes, yes, yes.

1548
01:20:12,730 --> 01:20:14,250
You can do it.
Yes.

1549
01:20:14,570 --> 01:20:15,370
Yes.

1550
01:20:15,450 --> 01:20:16,130
Very good.

1551
01:20:16,210 --> 01:20:16,650
Very good.

1552
01:20:16,730 --> 01:20:17,450
Very good.

1553
01:20:17,530 --> 01:20:18,250
Very good.

1554
01:20:18,330 --> 01:20:19,170
Yes.

1555
01:20:19,410 --> 01:20:19,970
Yes.

1556
01:20:20,050 --> 01:20:20,570
Push.

1557
01:20:20,650 --> 01:20:21,570
Push.

1558
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:22,810
One more push.

1559
01:20:22,970 --> 01:20:23,810
Yes.

1560
01:20:55,650 --> 01:20:56,690
She came.

1561
01:20:57,170 --> 01:20:57,850
Congratulations.

1562
01:20:58,010 --> 01:20:58,530
It's a boy.

1563
01:20:58,610 --> 01:20:59,330
Thank God.

1564
01:20:59,410 --> 01:21:00,570
Both mother and child are doing well.

1565
01:21:01,460 --> 01:21:03,450
Thank you, Lord.

1566
01:21:03,970 --> 01:21:05,450
This is great.

1567
01:21:06,810 --> 01:21:07,850
Can we go meet them?

1568
01:21:08,010 --> 01:21:10,170
Of course,
you can, but only after some time.

1569
01:21:10,650 --> 01:21:11,570
Okay.

1570
01:21:12,290 --> 01:21:13,570
It's a boy!

1571
01:21:14,450 --> 01:21:15,650
It's a boy!

1572
01:21:17,050 --> 01:21:17,970
Doctor?

1573
01:21:18,210 --> 01:21:19,130
Yes?

1574
01:21:19,210 --> 01:21:21,530
Is the child normal?

1575
01:21:21,690 --> 01:21:22,770
Yes, he is.

1576
01:21:22,850 --> 01:21:23,610
Why do you ask?

1577
01:21:24,330 --> 01:21:28,090
Previous tests showed that
there was a problem with the child.

1578
01:21:28,410 --> 01:21:30,010
There was a problem?
What was the problem?

1579
01:21:30,450 --> 01:21:32,010
- Where did you do these tests?
- In Jaipur.

1580
01:21:33,130 --> 01:21:35,170
There is a possibility that
the test might have suggested a problem.

1581
01:21:35,450 --> 01:21:37,290
But these tests are not always accurate.

1582
01:21:37,530 --> 01:21:39,090
Sometimes the tests
show incorrect results.

1583
01:21:39,410 --> 01:21:41,010
They are known as false positives.

1584
01:21:41,330 --> 01:21:42,170
Don't worry.

1585
01:21:42,250 --> 01:21:43,490
This baby is absolutely fine.

1586
01:23:21,930 --> 01:23:23,450
He is quite fair,
don't you think?

1587
01:23:23,530 --> 01:23:24,410
Yes, he is.

1588
01:23:24,490 --> 01:23:25,730
He has taken after his dad.

1589
01:23:28,770 --> 01:23:33,170
I have to say, I have never
seen such a beautiful child in my life.

1590
01:23:34,330 --> 01:23:36,610
You have given me such a lovely grandson.

1591
01:23:37,570 --> 01:23:40,220
No one in the city
has such a beautiful child.

1592
01:23:40,930 --> 01:23:43,050
I forgive you for all your mistakes.

1593
01:23:48,330 --> 01:23:49,410
Where's the baby?

1594
01:23:50,690 --> 01:23:51,610
Here.

1595
01:24:01,090 --> 01:24:02,250
Is this Mimi's child?

1596
01:24:02,330 --> 01:24:04,250
You think they left
someone else's child here?

1597
01:24:04,770 --> 01:24:05,690
Hmm?

1598
01:24:07,450 --> 01:24:08,610
- Uncle?
- Hmm?

1599
01:24:11,410 --> 01:24:12,570
- Uncle--
- Get your hand off me.

1600
01:24:13,250 --> 01:24:16,330
I think Mimi has tricked this driver.

1601
01:24:16,530 --> 01:24:17,810
I think the father
is someone else.

1602
01:24:17,890 --> 01:24:18,650
Hey!

1603
01:24:18,930 --> 01:24:19,610
No.

1604
01:24:19,810 --> 01:24:22,210
Mimi doesn't look like
uncle's daughter either.

1605
01:24:22,290 --> 01:24:23,450
Right.
Zip it.

1606
01:24:27,130 --> 01:24:28,210
Don't touch him.

1607
01:24:28,290 --> 01:24:29,210
Shut up.

1608
01:24:29,570 --> 01:24:32,490
Aatif, click our picture
with the baby?

1609
01:24:38,170 --> 01:24:39,410
This way.

1610
01:24:40,690 --> 01:24:41,610
Smile.

1611
01:24:44,450 --> 01:24:50,090
What did Mimi do so different
that she had such a beautiful child?

1612
01:24:50,650 --> 01:24:52,090
She ate fabric chalk.

1613
01:24:53,570 --> 01:24:54,650
Morning walk.

1614
01:24:56,410 --> 01:24:59,290
Look at them!

1615
01:25:01,970 --> 01:25:03,570
Going crazy over a fair baby.

1616
01:25:06,850 --> 01:25:08,810
They are here.

1617
01:25:13,570 --> 01:25:15,410
Look, such a fair baby!

1618
01:25:15,810 --> 01:25:17,810
Stay back, everyone.

1619
01:25:17,970 --> 01:25:18,730
"Fair baby! Fair baby!"

1620
01:25:18,850 --> 01:25:20,410
Buzz off!
When will this country

1621
01:25:20,530 --> 01:25:22,690
Stop obsessing over colour!

1622
01:25:24,970 --> 01:25:28,690
Let me ward off the evil.

1623
01:25:30,410 --> 01:25:33,290
You can enter the house
only after I am done.

1624
01:25:34,410 --> 01:25:37,690
Let me have a look at him.

1625
01:25:42,450 --> 01:25:45,410
You never stop amazing us, Lord.

1626
01:25:46,010 --> 01:25:49,210
He's like a lotus blooming in muddy water.

1627
01:25:50,170 --> 01:25:51,410
Mud?

1628
01:25:53,410 --> 01:25:57,690
Come on,
let's take our lotus inside.

1629
01:25:58,010 --> 01:25:59,050
Let's go.

1630
01:26:01,410 --> 01:26:03,490
He has become a star.

1631
01:26:05,170 --> 01:26:07,010
His mother is also a star.

1632
01:26:08,410 --> 01:26:09,610
Right.

1633
01:26:10,410 --> 01:26:14,210
- Here, feed him.
- Again?

1634
01:26:15,410 --> 01:26:17,610
You can stay.

1635
01:26:18,130 --> 01:26:19,250
She is your wife.

1636
01:26:19,650 --> 01:26:20,810
I am allergic.

1637
01:26:20,890 --> 01:26:22,010
Allergic?

1638
01:26:22,490 --> 01:26:23,650
To breast milk?

1639
01:26:32,450 --> 01:26:34,570
Feed him 10 times a day.

1640
01:26:35,210 --> 01:26:38,010
I'll go make something healthy for you.

1641
01:26:50,530 --> 01:26:51,850
How do you feel?

1642
01:26:54,130 --> 01:26:55,130
I don't know.

1643
01:26:57,810 --> 01:26:59,410
I feel different.

1644
01:27:02,850 --> 01:27:04,570
I had never imagined this.

1645
01:27:08,490 --> 01:27:11,250
What we imagine is not life!

1646
01:27:12,450 --> 01:27:15,410
What happens to us, is Life.

1647
01:27:16,650 --> 01:27:20,530
I had never imagined that
I'd lose mom so early in life.

1648
01:27:21,690 --> 01:27:24,570
Or that dad would
choose a spiritual life.

1649
01:27:25,010 --> 01:27:27,570
Or that the man I'd marry
would turn out to be a monster.

1650
01:27:28,690 --> 01:27:30,010
But what can we do?

1651
01:27:30,810 --> 01:27:32,210
We have to keep moving forward.

1652
01:27:36,410 --> 01:27:37,530
Hmm.

1653
01:27:39,530 --> 01:27:41,410
I guess you are right.

1654
01:27:46,610 --> 01:27:50,090
So, what have you decided?

1655
01:27:50,690 --> 01:27:52,090
What's next?

1656
01:27:54,490 --> 01:27:56,090
Next?

1657
01:27:58,730 --> 01:28:00,610
Change his diaper.

1658
01:28:07,010 --> 01:28:10,970
Bhanu, what's your secret
behind having such a fair child?

1659
01:28:11,050 --> 01:28:13,010
Please share it with me.

1660
01:28:15,850 --> 01:28:17,410
Promise you won't tell anyone?

1661
01:28:24,610 --> 01:28:27,410
Boil red soil with a
pinch of salt and drink it.

1662
01:28:27,730 --> 01:28:29,170
- Really?
- Really.

1663
01:28:29,530 --> 01:28:30,810
Have it twice a day.

1664
01:28:30,970 --> 01:28:36,050
And if you manage to get a strand of
white goat's beard, is magical!

1665
01:28:36,290 --> 01:28:37,490
- A white goat's beard?
- Yes.

1666
01:28:37,810 --> 01:28:38,970
Thanks, bro.

1667
01:28:48,170 --> 01:28:48,850
Hi Rekhu!

1668
01:28:48,930 --> 01:28:49,850
What is wrong with you?

1669
01:28:50,010 --> 01:28:51,250
Why aren't you taking my calls?

1670
01:28:51,810 --> 01:28:53,290
I told you I am busy.

1671
01:28:53,490 --> 01:28:56,050
I am traveling with the American couple.

1672
01:28:56,130 --> 01:28:57,450
Are you showing
them the whole country?

1673
01:28:57,570 --> 01:28:59,210
You remember you have a family, don't you?

1674
01:29:01,410 --> 01:29:03,210
Of course I do,
that's why I sent some money.

1675
01:29:03,570 --> 01:29:04,570
Didn't I come there just a few days back?

1676
01:29:04,650 --> 01:29:06,410
Even took you sightseeing.
What else do you want?

1677
01:29:07,170 --> 01:29:08,130
How's Mom?

1678
01:29:08,210 --> 01:29:08,730
Mom?

1679
01:29:08,810 --> 01:29:10,970
Mom misses you.

1680
01:29:11,050 --> 01:29:12,530
She keeps crying.

1681
01:29:13,050 --> 01:29:14,010
Hello?

1682
01:29:14,090 --> 01:29:15,410
Yes?

1683
01:29:15,490 --> 01:29:18,130
Come back, son.
I am missing you.

1684
01:29:18,410 --> 01:29:19,610
I will come back soon.

1685
01:29:19,690 --> 01:29:21,850
People who go to Mumbai don't
come back for years at a stretch.

1686
01:29:22,130 --> 01:29:24,010
I keep visiting you, don't I?

1687
01:29:24,410 --> 01:29:25,530
Why do you even bother?

1688
01:29:25,610 --> 01:29:27,450
Why don't you go abroad
with that couple?

1689
01:29:27,730 --> 01:29:28,490
Hang up now.

1690
01:29:28,570 --> 01:29:29,730
Hello?
Hello?

1691
01:29:32,570 --> 01:29:34,850
You want to know how to have
a fair baby too right?

1692
01:29:35,810 --> 01:29:36,850
Eat turmeric.

1693
01:29:36,930 --> 01:29:38,330
And drink half a glass of milk,

1694
01:29:38,410 --> 01:29:39,850
and use the other half to wash off.

1695
01:29:39,930 --> 01:29:41,010
Every day.

1696
01:29:43,050 --> 01:29:44,650
Something is not right, Mom.

1697
01:29:45,330 --> 01:29:47,050
It's been months since he last came home.

1698
01:29:47,130 --> 01:29:48,690
He could have come at least once.

1699
01:29:49,130 --> 01:29:50,490
What's wrong with this American couple,

1700
01:29:50,570 --> 01:29:51,810
they don't seem to want to go back.

1701
01:29:51,970 --> 01:29:53,450
I think I should talk to Altaf.

1702
01:30:02,050 --> 01:30:04,530
Uncle, my brother in Saudi had called.

1703
01:30:04,970 --> 01:30:06,250
There's a job opening at his hotel.

1704
01:30:06,330 --> 01:30:07,170
He wants me there.

1705
01:30:07,690 --> 01:30:11,330
After learning music for 10 years,
you want to work in a hotel?

1706
01:30:11,410 --> 01:30:13,410
I can't help it. I'll have to go.

1707
01:30:13,970 --> 01:30:15,210
Very good.

1708
01:30:15,650 --> 01:30:16,490
Go.

1709
01:30:17,290 --> 01:30:19,490
When you go there,
find me a suitable job as well.

1710
01:30:20,410 --> 01:30:21,610
Sure, Uncle. I will find
you one as soon as I get there.

1711
01:30:28,610 --> 01:30:30,970
Have you seen him?

1712
01:30:31,050 --> 01:30:31,690
Him?

1713
01:30:31,770 --> 01:30:33,170
Who hasn't seen him?

1714
01:30:33,250 --> 01:30:34,810
No one is as lucky as he is.

1715
01:30:35,250 --> 01:30:36,450
You know him?

1716
01:30:36,530 --> 01:30:38,010
He is Mimi's husband.

1717
01:30:39,930 --> 01:30:40,850
Mimi's husband?

1718
01:30:41,010 --> 01:30:41,850
Who is Mimi?

1719
01:30:42,490 --> 01:30:43,410
He's Mimi's husband?

1720
01:30:44,610 --> 01:30:45,690
He is Rekha's husband.

1721
01:30:46,770 --> 01:30:48,170
Let's go, Mom.

1722
01:30:48,490 --> 01:30:49,570
Have you lost it?

1723
01:30:50,810 --> 01:30:52,010
Want another smack?

1724
01:30:53,490 --> 01:30:55,410
What is this lunatic saying?

1725
01:30:57,090 --> 01:31:00,570
Your delicious meals
remind me of my mother.

1726
01:31:00,650 --> 01:31:02,050
One day I'll make you meet her.

1727
01:31:04,570 --> 01:31:06,010
Does Mimi stay here?

1728
01:31:09,010 --> 01:31:09,690
Yes.

1729
01:31:11,530 --> 01:31:12,570
You are Mimi?

1730
01:31:13,130 --> 01:31:14,330
Yes.
Who are you?

1731
01:31:16,170 --> 01:31:17,010
What do you want?

1732
01:31:18,290 --> 01:31:21,410
What's wrong with you?
Why did you marry my husband?

1733
01:31:21,490 --> 01:31:23,330
Any boy would have happily
married you.

1734
01:31:23,410 --> 01:31:24,370
Stop your nonsense.

1735
01:31:24,450 --> 01:31:25,730
I think you've got the wrong house.

1736
01:31:25,850 --> 01:31:27,450
Where do you think you are going, huh?

1737
01:31:27,530 --> 01:31:29,210
God cant save you today!

1738
01:31:29,290 --> 01:31:30,530
Dont you dare hide in the temple.

1739
01:31:30,610 --> 01:31:31,570
Come with me.

1740
01:31:31,650 --> 01:31:32,330
Come on.

1741
01:31:32,410 --> 01:31:33,370
Why!

1742
01:31:33,450 --> 01:31:34,290
Why!

1743
01:31:34,410 --> 01:31:35,610
Why did you do this, huh?

1744
01:31:35,730 --> 01:31:37,370
Don't you have any shame?

1745
01:31:37,450 --> 01:31:39,330
You have no shame?

1746
01:31:40,490 --> 01:31:42,170
Why did you do this, huh?

1747
01:31:42,410 --> 01:31:43,330
Why?

1748
01:31:43,410 --> 01:31:46,490
You left your wife for this young witch?

1749
01:31:46,830 --> 01:31:48,090
- Wife?
- What?

1750
01:31:48,170 --> 01:31:49,450
- His wife?
- Yes.

1751
01:31:49,930 --> 01:31:53,330
Oh God, what is going on?

1752
01:31:54,690 --> 01:31:55,850
Son-in-law?

1753
01:31:56,410 --> 01:31:57,330
Is it true?

1754
01:31:57,410 --> 01:31:59,850
He is not your son under any law.

1755
01:32:00,210 --> 01:32:01,170
She is his wife.

1756
01:32:01,250 --> 01:32:02,530
And he is my son.

1757
01:32:02,770 --> 01:32:04,450
Who are you guys, huh?

1758
01:32:06,890 --> 01:32:07,970
Son?

1759
01:32:08,050 --> 01:32:10,050
What is going on, Shobha?

1760
01:32:10,130 --> 01:32:11,370
What are they saying, huh?

1761
01:32:11,450 --> 01:32:12,970
He's a married man!

1762
01:32:13,930 --> 01:32:18,170
How many more secrets
does your movie have, Mimi?

1763
01:32:18,370 --> 01:32:20,090
Start talking, you wretch.

1764
01:32:20,370 --> 01:32:24,010
You left your wife for this young girl?

1765
01:32:24,130 --> 01:32:26,290
I hope you at least remember
this old mother of yours.

1766
01:32:26,370 --> 01:32:27,810
Rekha!

1767
01:32:28,170 --> 01:32:30,410
Rekhu, please hear me out.

1768
01:32:30,490 --> 01:32:32,010
I don't want to hear a word.

1769
01:32:32,090 --> 01:32:34,170
My life has been ruined.

1770
01:32:35,410 --> 01:32:37,050
Rekhu...

1771
01:32:39,570 --> 01:32:41,210
Is she really your wife?

1772
01:32:43,610 --> 01:32:47,490
I cannot believe that two
women are fighting over this driver.

1773
01:32:47,570 --> 01:32:49,330
He has a genie under his command, Uncle.

1774
01:32:49,410 --> 01:32:51,970
Hello, he has no genie under his command.

1775
01:32:52,370 --> 01:32:54,250
I am his wife.
His first and official wife.

1776
01:32:54,330 --> 01:32:57,130
Are you the burqa clad
woman I'd seen with him?

1777
01:33:00,370 --> 01:33:02,290
A burqa clad woman? Mom?

1778
01:33:02,370 --> 01:33:04,770
Oh God! You have a Muslim wife as well?

1779
01:33:05,370 --> 01:33:07,290
Didn't I tell you that she was his aunt?

1780
01:33:07,370 --> 01:33:08,530
His aunt?

1781
01:33:08,610 --> 01:33:10,210
But I don't have a sister.

1782
01:33:10,610 --> 01:33:12,810
Who was that woman?
Why don't you tell us, huh?

1783
01:33:12,970 --> 01:33:14,010
There you go!

1784
01:33:14,090 --> 01:33:17,490
Bastard! You were already married?

1785
01:33:17,570 --> 01:33:20,650
How dare you marry my
daughter have a child with her!

1786
01:33:20,730 --> 01:33:21,930
- A child!
- Yes.

1787
01:33:22,010 --> 01:33:23,370
- His child?
- Yes.

1788
01:33:26,530 --> 01:33:28,450
Oh hell!

1789
01:33:30,250 --> 01:33:32,370
This is a nightmare!

1790
01:33:33,090 --> 01:33:35,170
He had a child with her?

1791
01:33:36,370 --> 01:33:38,130
That's why he left you, Rekha.

1792
01:33:38,370 --> 01:33:42,330
He had a child with this tall witch
because he couldn't have one with you.

1793
01:33:42,410 --> 01:33:43,410
Where's his child?

1794
01:33:43,650 --> 01:33:44,370
Where's his child?

1795
01:33:44,450 --> 01:33:46,090
Is that his child?

1796
01:33:46,210 --> 01:33:47,610
Easy! Easy...

1797
01:33:47,690 --> 01:33:48,770
He is asleep.

1798
01:33:54,890 --> 01:33:56,050
Whose child is he?

1799
01:33:56,370 --> 01:33:57,410
He is my child.

1800
01:33:57,490 --> 01:33:58,730
Who is his father?

1801
01:33:58,810 --> 01:34:00,810
Your husband.

1802
01:34:06,370 --> 01:34:08,290
Let me have a look at him.

1803
01:34:11,490 --> 01:34:12,570
What is this?

1804
01:34:12,890 --> 01:34:15,290
This is Bhanu's child?

1805
01:34:15,370 --> 01:34:18,930
Mimi please tell them the
truth before someone ends up dead.

1806
01:34:19,010 --> 01:34:20,210
I am not going to die!

1807
01:34:20,290 --> 01:34:22,330
But I will take your
dead body back with us!

1808
01:34:22,410 --> 01:34:24,410
Where do you think you
are running to, huh?

1809
01:34:24,570 --> 01:34:26,490
You gave her such a beautiful child?

1810
01:34:26,970 --> 01:34:29,810
And all I got was hope.

1811
01:34:30,610 --> 01:34:31,730
He is not the father.

1812
01:34:31,810 --> 01:34:32,730
There!

1813
01:34:33,090 --> 01:34:33,810
Huh?

1814
01:34:39,570 --> 01:34:42,250
And I am not married to him.

1815
01:34:47,170 --> 01:34:50,490
What do you mean by
you are not married?

1816
01:34:51,250 --> 01:34:52,690
What are you saying?

1817
01:34:53,250 --> 01:34:54,530
I don't understand.

1818
01:34:54,930 --> 01:34:57,810
Tell me the truth.

1819
01:35:00,010 --> 01:35:01,770
Shama, why don't you
tell us the truth, hmm?

1820
01:35:04,130 --> 01:35:06,050
An American couple had come here.

1821
01:35:06,370 --> 01:35:08,770
They had their child
planted inside Mimi's womb.

1822
01:35:09,210 --> 01:35:13,370
They promised her a huge sum
if she'd carry their baby to term.

1823
01:35:13,770 --> 01:35:16,570
But they didn't keep
their word and they ran away.

1824
01:35:16,840 --> 01:35:19,690
They ran away?

1825
01:35:19,810 --> 01:35:21,930
How can they just plant
their child in her womb?

1826
01:35:22,010 --> 01:35:23,970
She must have done something
with that American man...

1827
01:35:24,170 --> 01:35:25,490
No Mom, she didn't.

1828
01:35:25,570 --> 01:35:26,810
This is a new technology.

1829
01:35:26,890 --> 01:35:27,770
He is their child.

1830
01:35:27,850 --> 01:35:29,610
She just nurtured him in her womb.

1831
01:35:30,290 --> 01:35:32,050
- Oh God!
- I didnt, I swear.

1832
01:35:33,370 --> 01:35:35,010
She isn't married.

1833
01:35:37,170 --> 01:35:38,570
She didn't become a movie star.

1834
01:35:39,370 --> 01:35:41,050
She isn't his mother.

1835
01:35:41,170 --> 01:35:42,770
I am feeling dizzy.

1836
01:35:43,370 --> 01:35:46,610
Aatif, get me some water.

1837
01:35:46,690 --> 01:35:48,410
And put some poison in it.

1838
01:35:49,450 --> 01:35:50,450
Mimi,

1839
01:35:52,370 --> 01:35:54,290
you gave birth to this child, right?

1840
01:35:54,370 --> 01:35:55,410
Yes, Mom.

1841
01:35:57,570 --> 01:35:59,370
So you are his mother, right?

1842
01:36:00,370 --> 01:36:01,570
Yes, Mom.

1843
01:36:04,010 --> 01:36:05,370
I am his mother.

1844
01:36:08,370 --> 01:36:10,170
And he belongs to us.

1845
01:36:10,970 --> 01:36:12,290
He is your grandson.

1846
01:36:12,650 --> 01:36:13,530
He is our Raj.

1847
01:36:13,610 --> 01:36:14,570
Right.

1848
01:36:32,450 --> 01:36:39,450
"Life's a mystery,
don't try to figure it out."

1849
01:36:39,530 --> 01:36:46,250
"Life's a journey, just enjoy the ride."

1850
01:36:47,130 --> 01:36:52,490
"It's a new dawn."

1851
01:36:53,130 --> 01:36:59,370
"It's a new day."

1852
01:37:00,690 --> 01:37:07,130
"Our destination will
always remain the same,"

1853
01:37:07,410 --> 01:37:13,770
"only the paths will change."

1854
01:37:14,770 --> 01:37:21,730
"Life's a mystery,
don't try to figure it out."

1855
01:37:21,810 --> 01:37:29,130
"Life's a journey, just enjoy the ride."

1856
01:37:38,010 --> 01:37:43,290
Mimi, Bunty teased me at school.

1857
01:37:43,730 --> 01:37:47,170
He called me a white ghost.

1858
01:37:47,570 --> 01:37:50,530
Why am I so different
from the others, Mimi?

1859
01:37:51,170 --> 01:37:52,450
Bunty has no sense.

1860
01:37:52,650 --> 01:37:53,970
Don't pay attention to him.

1861
01:37:54,730 --> 01:37:57,090
You are not an ordinary child.

1862
01:37:57,970 --> 01:37:59,130
You see that star?

1863
01:38:00,370 --> 01:38:03,010
You were a star just like that one.

1864
01:38:03,370 --> 01:38:04,610
- Then?
- Then what?

1865
01:38:05,170 --> 01:38:09,970
A white angel came and gifted you to me.

1866
01:38:10,370 --> 01:38:12,290
He is very smart.

1867
01:38:12,770 --> 01:38:14,130
He is very naughty.

1868
01:38:14,210 --> 01:38:17,370
And he... will have a lot of chocolates.

1869
01:38:17,490 --> 01:38:19,050
You don't say!

1870
01:38:19,370 --> 01:38:21,930
I didn't know that, Mimi.

1871
01:38:22,010 --> 01:38:23,650
I didn't know that!

1872
01:38:43,730 --> 01:38:50,370
"The ones you've been
humming since ages..."

1873
01:38:50,450 --> 01:38:54,290
"If not the lyric, atleast..."

1874
01:38:54,370 --> 01:38:57,570
"Change the melody of those songs"

1875
01:38:57,650 --> 01:39:01,250
"It takes aways so much"

1876
01:39:01,370 --> 01:39:04,730
"Yet returns in so many folds."

1877
01:39:04,810 --> 01:39:13,690
"They say,
time takes pleasure in doing so"

1878
01:39:15,380 --> 01:39:22,290
"Life's a mystery,
don't try to figure it out."

1879
01:39:22,370 --> 01:39:29,410
"Life's a journey, just enjoy the ride."

1880
01:39:29,490 --> 01:39:35,450
"It's a new dawn."

1881
01:39:36,010 --> 01:39:41,970
"It's a new day."

1882
01:39:43,690 --> 01:39:49,570
"Our destination will
always remain the same,"

1883
01:39:50,290 --> 01:39:56,610
"only the paths will change."

1884
01:39:57,650 --> 01:40:04,610
"Life's a mystery,
don't try to figure it out."

1885
01:40:04,690 --> 01:40:11,730
"Life's a journey, just enjoy the ride."

1886
01:40:11,810 --> 01:40:18,690
"Life's a mystery,
don't try to figure it out."

1887
01:40:18,770 --> 01:40:25,970
"Life's a journey, just enjoy the ride."

1888
01:40:28,970 --> 01:40:32,250
Mimi, why did you name me Raj?

1889
01:40:32,770 --> 01:40:35,370
Because that's what heroes
are called in the movies.

1890
01:40:35,690 --> 01:40:37,250
You are the hero of my movie, aren't you?

1891
01:40:37,370 --> 01:40:39,650
Where's my heroine, Mimi?

1892
01:40:40,010 --> 01:40:41,130
What do you mean where is she?

1893
01:40:41,210 --> 01:40:42,010
Who am I then?

1894
01:40:42,090 --> 01:40:43,010
Mimi.

1895
01:40:43,090 --> 01:40:44,130
You don't say!

1896
01:40:44,490 --> 01:40:46,370
I didn't become a heroine because of him,

1897
01:40:46,490 --> 01:40:48,250
and he won't even let
me be the star in his life.

1898
01:40:48,570 --> 01:40:50,810
No one values
talent and sacrifice here.

1899
01:40:54,770 --> 01:40:55,930
One... Two...

1900
01:40:57,450 --> 01:40:59,930
Hey you naughty boy Raj.

1901
01:41:00,010 --> 01:41:02,330
Mimi you lost!

1902
01:41:02,410 --> 01:41:04,690
Grandma! I won!

1903
01:41:04,770 --> 01:41:07,410
Grandma, who are these people?

1904
01:41:26,490 --> 01:41:27,570
Hi.

1905
01:41:28,370 --> 01:41:29,370
Look at you.

1906
01:41:32,090 --> 01:41:33,250
Look at you.

1907
01:41:36,410 --> 01:41:37,450
This is not fair.

1908
01:41:37,530 --> 01:41:38,490
You cheat every day.

1909
01:41:50,570 --> 01:41:52,330
Raj, go to your room.

1910
01:41:52,410 --> 01:41:53,530
Ok Mimi.

1911
01:41:57,130 --> 01:41:58,410
I'm sorry.

1912
01:41:59,730 --> 01:42:02,730
I'm so so sorry.

1913
01:42:04,250 --> 01:42:05,690
Please forgive me.

1914
01:42:08,210 --> 01:42:09,490
Please, I am sorry.

1915
01:42:12,690 --> 01:42:14,970
I'm so glad you kept our baby.

1916
01:42:15,050 --> 01:42:16,210
My baby.

1917
01:42:17,610 --> 01:42:24,570
Mimi, this woman saying
that Raj is her son.

1918
01:42:26,370 --> 01:42:29,010
How dare you say that he is your son, huh?

1919
01:42:29,090 --> 01:42:29,570
Don't you have any shame?

1920
01:42:29,650 --> 01:42:31,410
How dare you come back
after four years and say that?

1921
01:42:31,610 --> 01:42:32,570
Mimi--

1922
01:42:32,650 --> 01:42:34,970
Mimi, we're so very-very sorry.

1923
01:42:35,050 --> 01:42:36,490
- Sorry?
- Yeah.

1924
01:42:36,970 --> 01:42:40,250
Please, just...
give us a chance to explain.

1925
01:42:43,370 --> 01:42:48,610
Mimi, after we left, we didn't try
to have another baby through surrogacy.

1926
01:42:50,290 --> 01:42:56,290
Please, we were quite disturbed.

1927
01:42:58,570 --> 01:43:01,250
We were just trying to
be happy for all this time.

1928
01:43:03,010 --> 01:43:06,970
One day, we saw a video on Facebook.

1929
01:43:07,810 --> 01:43:16,090
We saw a white boy dancing
with his Indian mother in a hotel.

1930
01:43:17,410 --> 01:43:18,930
We realised that the mother is you.

1931
01:43:19,010 --> 01:43:22,690
Yes, mother is me not you!

1932
01:43:24,090 --> 01:43:25,210
Okay?

1933
01:43:27,370 --> 01:43:28,490
You ran away.

1934
01:43:29,170 --> 01:43:31,210
Because you thought
that your child is faulty.

1935
01:43:32,170 --> 01:43:33,170
There is no fault in the child.

1936
01:43:33,250 --> 01:43:34,810
Your way of thinking is faulty.

1937
01:43:36,170 --> 01:43:37,290
The problem lies with you.

1938
01:43:37,370 --> 01:43:40,450
You left your child in
someone's womb and ran away.

1939
01:43:41,810 --> 01:43:43,570
You didn't even think about me.

1940
01:43:44,370 --> 01:43:45,610
What will I do?

1941
01:43:45,690 --> 01:43:47,090
What will happen to the child?

1942
01:43:47,970 --> 01:43:49,530
You'd asked me to abort the child, right?

1943
01:43:50,490 --> 01:43:53,370
And suddenly, after four years,
you realised that you love your child?

1944
01:43:56,050 --> 01:43:57,970
You think you are "mother-father" of Raj?

1945
01:43:58,930 --> 01:43:59,570
No!

1946
01:43:59,650 --> 01:44:00,650
No.

1947
01:44:01,370 --> 01:44:03,370
I am "mother-father" of Raj.

1948
01:44:04,210 --> 01:44:05,290
I gave birth to him.

1949
01:44:05,370 --> 01:44:06,930
I nurtured him.
I raised him, not you.

1950
01:44:07,010 --> 01:44:07,930
Got it?

1951
01:44:12,730 --> 01:44:14,770
Why are you here?
What do you want?

1952
01:44:18,250 --> 01:44:19,250
Our baby.

1953
01:44:19,370 --> 01:44:20,530
Don't even think about it.

1954
01:44:21,370 --> 01:44:22,930
Don't you dare think about it!

1955
01:44:25,370 --> 01:44:26,370
Get out.

1956
01:44:35,090 --> 01:44:36,770
Please forgive me.

1957
01:44:51,970 --> 01:44:53,210
Mimi!

1958
01:45:02,110 --> 01:45:03,530
Mimi look at this!

1959
01:45:04,370 --> 01:45:06,090
This is our house.

1960
01:45:07,410 --> 01:45:08,770
This is me.

1961
01:45:08,930 --> 01:45:10,370
That's you.

1962
01:45:11,370 --> 01:45:12,690
That's Bhanu.

1963
01:45:12,770 --> 01:45:15,130
Aunt Shama.

1964
01:45:15,290 --> 01:45:17,770
And grandma grandpa.

1965
01:45:19,930 --> 01:45:21,610
What's wrong, Mimi?

1966
01:45:22,930 --> 01:45:23,770
Nothing.

1967
01:45:23,930 --> 01:45:26,050
You didn't like my drawing?

1968
01:45:26,290 --> 01:45:28,050
Your drawing is perfect.

1969
01:45:28,210 --> 01:45:29,370
Then whats the problem?

1970
01:45:31,450 --> 01:45:33,690
You'll never leave your Mimi, right?

1971
01:45:34,050 --> 01:45:35,410
Never.

1972
01:45:36,690 --> 01:45:37,730
Promise?

1973
01:45:38,050 --> 01:45:39,370
Promise.

1974
01:45:50,010 --> 01:45:51,170
How can they just ask
us to give the child back?

1975
01:45:51,250 --> 01:45:53,250
How dare they come back!

1976
01:45:53,610 --> 01:45:54,730
They think this is a joke?

1977
01:45:54,970 --> 01:45:56,490
Why didn't you slap her?

1978
01:45:57,410 --> 01:45:58,570
Shameless woman!

1979
01:45:59,570 --> 01:46:01,050
Like he is some toy,

1980
01:46:01,370 --> 01:46:02,570
that they left behind
and now want back.

1981
01:46:02,650 --> 01:46:04,250
They have no right over the child.

1982
01:46:04,530 --> 01:46:05,730
If they cause trouble, don't worry...

1983
01:46:05,810 --> 01:46:07,250
I am friends with a few cops.

1984
01:46:18,290 --> 01:46:21,730
We have brought some toys for Raj.

1985
01:46:25,170 --> 01:46:26,370
From the US.

1986
01:46:28,610 --> 01:46:29,770
I have personally bought them.

1987
01:46:29,930 --> 01:46:30,770
We don't want them!

1988
01:46:34,010 --> 01:46:35,250
Why are you back?

1989
01:46:37,650 --> 01:46:41,370
Mimi, please understand.

1990
01:46:45,090 --> 01:46:46,330
We have faced a lot.

1991
01:46:46,410 --> 01:46:47,690
I too have faced a lot.

1992
01:46:47,770 --> 01:46:50,010
Please, please listen.

1993
01:46:55,170 --> 01:46:57,490
Raj is our last hope.

1994
01:46:59,690 --> 01:47:01,770
You can have another child.

1995
01:47:02,770 --> 01:47:04,610
But I can't.

1996
01:47:06,650 --> 01:47:08,690
Raj will be happy with us.

1997
01:47:09,370 --> 01:47:12,690
You became a surrogate
For a brighter future, Mimi.

1998
01:47:15,050 --> 01:47:17,490
What will you do for Raj's future, huh?

1999
01:47:23,090 --> 01:47:25,370
We'll give him the best life in US.

2000
01:47:27,090 --> 01:47:28,370
- You--
- Mimi!

2001
01:47:29,690 --> 01:47:30,810
Mimi!

2002
01:47:34,570 --> 01:47:35,490
Hi!

2003
01:47:35,570 --> 01:47:36,410
Hey!

2004
01:47:41,890 --> 01:47:42,490
Hey!

2005
01:47:46,610 --> 01:47:48,370
I hear your name is Raj.

2006
01:47:51,140 --> 01:47:51,970
My name is John.

2007
01:47:55,410 --> 01:47:56,370
This is Summer.

2008
01:47:57,930 --> 01:47:58,810
Hi!

2009
01:47:59,650 --> 01:48:00,410
Hi!

2010
01:48:01,370 --> 01:48:04,130
Auntie, are these for me?

2011
01:48:04,450 --> 01:48:05,730
Yes.

2012
01:48:05,810 --> 01:48:07,250
We brought them for you.

2013
01:48:08,010 --> 01:48:09,050
Look at this.

2014
01:48:10,480 --> 01:48:11,370
Look.

2015
01:48:14,370 --> 01:48:16,410
So many toys!

2016
01:48:16,570 --> 01:48:18,530
Aeroplane!

2017
01:48:18,610 --> 01:48:20,090
Remote Control!

2018
01:48:21,410 --> 01:48:22,410
See...

2019
01:48:22,730 --> 01:48:24,170
It can fly.

2020
01:48:24,370 --> 01:48:31,170
Auntie, are you the same white
angel who had left me with Mimi?

2021
01:48:37,090 --> 01:48:38,170
Yes.

2022
01:48:38,250 --> 01:48:39,610
That's me.

2023
01:48:44,410 --> 01:48:45,570
Raj, come with me.

2024
01:48:45,650 --> 01:48:46,730
You need to get ready for school.

2025
01:48:46,810 --> 01:48:47,970
Mimi let me go.

2026
01:48:48,610 --> 01:48:49,970
I don't have school today, Mimi.

2027
01:48:53,370 --> 01:48:54,410
Please let him play.

2028
01:48:59,610 --> 01:49:01,370
Look it flies!

2029
01:49:09,130 --> 01:49:10,170
Thank you, Mimi.

2030
01:49:10,610 --> 01:49:12,970
I feel so alive being around him.

2031
01:49:15,370 --> 01:49:16,370
Angel Auntie?

2032
01:49:17,290 --> 01:49:18,490
It has stopped working.

2033
01:49:18,570 --> 01:49:19,690
Okay.

2034
01:49:20,370 --> 01:49:21,490
Wait.

2035
01:49:24,050 --> 01:49:25,210
Let me help.

2036
01:49:25,650 --> 01:49:26,930
There you go.

2037
01:49:32,450 --> 01:49:37,610
I swear Mimi, I haven't seen
Summer this happy in four years.

2038
01:49:38,090 --> 01:49:39,170
Enough of this drama.

2039
01:49:40,370 --> 01:49:41,810
Raj isn't your child.

2040
01:49:41,970 --> 01:49:43,170
He is Mimi's son.

2041
01:49:45,370 --> 01:49:47,370
No Bhanu, he isn't.

2042
01:49:49,130 --> 01:49:50,090
Look at him.

2043
01:49:50,740 --> 01:49:51,730
Look.

2044
01:49:56,930 --> 01:49:58,370
You think he belongs here?

2045
01:49:59,730 --> 01:50:00,930
No.

2046
01:50:02,170 --> 01:50:05,450
He's our son and we're
not going back without him.

2047
01:50:10,370 --> 01:50:13,490
You don't know this, but Summer tried to--

2048
01:50:17,050 --> 01:50:19,210
Summer attempted suicide.

2049
01:50:20,770 --> 01:50:22,810
Now do you want her
to die because I don't.

2050
01:50:24,770 --> 01:50:25,930
I'm not gonna let that happen.

2051
01:50:26,010 --> 01:50:28,570
And I will go to any extent
for my wife's happiness.

2052
01:50:32,130 --> 01:50:38,530
So, give me my son back or
I will take legal action against you.

2053
01:50:44,410 --> 01:50:45,810
Do you understand?

2054
01:51:26,410 --> 01:51:27,730
Raj!

2055
01:51:28,730 --> 01:51:29,610
You...!

2056
01:51:29,690 --> 01:51:30,930
You just wait there, you scoundrel.

2057
01:51:31,210 --> 01:51:32,050
Are you blind?

2058
01:51:32,130 --> 01:51:33,370
Are you blind?

2059
01:51:33,450 --> 01:51:34,210
Can't you see?

2060
01:51:34,290 --> 01:51:35,770
- You couldn't see my baby?
- Mimi! Mimi!

2061
01:51:35,930 --> 01:51:37,370
What if something would
have happened to him?

2062
01:51:37,450 --> 01:51:39,130
He was playing in the middle of the road.

2063
01:51:39,570 --> 01:51:41,690
- So what?
- He was playing on the road.

2064
01:51:41,770 --> 01:51:43,090
- He can play wherever he wants.
- Let him go.

2065
01:51:43,170 --> 01:51:43,930
He is my child.

2066
01:51:44,010 --> 01:51:45,130
Let him go, Mimi.

2067
01:51:45,210 --> 01:51:46,210
He was playing on the road.

2068
01:51:46,290 --> 01:51:48,410
Who are you to tell me where
he can play and cannot play?

2069
01:51:48,530 --> 01:51:49,130
Please go.

2070
01:51:49,210 --> 01:51:50,450
- Buzz off.
- Go.

2071
01:51:51,210 --> 01:51:52,970
- Come on, Mimi.
- Let's go inside, Mimi.

2072
01:52:14,730 --> 01:52:15,650
John ji.

2073
01:52:16,130 --> 01:52:17,090
Summer ji.

2074
01:52:20,370 --> 01:52:24,610
I am sorry to learn
what you have been through.

2075
01:52:25,450 --> 01:52:27,650
I heard you tried to commit suicide.

2076
01:52:30,650 --> 01:52:38,490
Summer ji, sometimes it
is easier to die than to survive.

2077
01:52:39,370 --> 01:52:44,210
You two left her in that state,
but Mimi still survived and she fought.

2078
01:52:44,570 --> 01:52:49,370
She fought with herself,
with the society and her dreams.

2079
01:52:50,090 --> 01:52:51,650
It has been a long,
uphill battle for her.

2080
01:52:53,770 --> 01:52:56,370
You know she wanted
to be a movie star.

2081
01:52:56,730 --> 01:52:59,290
She is the most beautiful
girl in Shekhawati.

2082
01:52:59,370 --> 01:53:01,210
She is the best dancer we have here.

2083
01:53:02,650 --> 01:53:05,050
She wanted to go to Mumbai
and join the film industry.

2084
01:53:05,410 --> 01:53:09,290
After Raj was born,
she bundled up all her dreams,

2085
01:53:09,370 --> 01:53:12,290
and threw them somewhere
far away in the desert.

2086
01:53:13,730 --> 01:53:15,370
Raj is her world now.

2087
01:53:16,690 --> 01:53:19,130
And now you came and take legal action?

2088
01:53:20,730 --> 01:53:22,010
Listen Bhanu--

2089
01:53:22,090 --> 01:53:25,690
Listen, listen John,
you think Mimi is alone?

2090
01:53:26,410 --> 01:53:27,370
No.

2091
01:53:28,530 --> 01:53:29,770
We are with her.

2092
01:53:31,010 --> 01:53:33,530
You can go anywhere you want,
approach any court you want.

2093
01:53:33,730 --> 01:53:35,090
We are ready to fight.

2094
01:53:37,690 --> 01:53:38,930
Let's go.

2095
01:53:58,690 --> 01:53:59,930
Mimi?

2096
01:54:36,370 --> 01:54:41,530
The angel is back to take her star.

2097
01:54:46,010 --> 01:54:48,770
How do I fight an angel, Shama?

2098
01:55:57,770 --> 01:56:02,690
This contract clearly states that you need
to hand over the child after the delivery,

2099
01:56:03,250 --> 01:56:06,290
if they pay you what
they had agreed upon.

2100
01:56:06,970 --> 01:56:08,290
You will have to handle
the child over to them.

2101
01:56:08,690 --> 01:56:11,210
But they ran away,
leaving the child with her.

2102
01:56:11,290 --> 01:56:14,010
That doesn't give Mimi
legal rights over the child.

2103
01:56:14,530 --> 01:56:17,290
They will do a DNA test and
prove their paternity in the court.

2104
01:56:19,010 --> 01:56:22,370
Bhanu, we can fight a case against them,
but it won't be easy.

2105
01:56:22,650 --> 01:56:24,690
It will be a long and
an expensive legal battle.

2106
01:56:25,370 --> 01:56:29,210
Mimi and the child will have to
be present in the court for every hearing.

2107
01:56:29,290 --> 01:56:31,370
Why does the child
need to go to the court?

2108
01:56:31,490 --> 01:56:33,410
The case won't move forward without him.

2109
01:56:33,570 --> 01:56:35,130
We are fighting this case for him.

2110
01:56:37,290 --> 01:56:38,370
I'll get going now.

2111
01:56:43,370 --> 01:56:47,170
Bhanu, let me know when the case is filed.

2112
01:56:47,250 --> 01:56:48,370
- Okay.
- We will try our best.

2113
01:56:48,810 --> 01:56:49,610
Okay.

2114
01:56:51,610 --> 01:56:53,250
I will walk you out.

2115
01:56:56,130 --> 01:56:57,530
Don't worry, Mimi.

2116
01:56:58,210 --> 01:56:59,130
You have our support.

2117
01:57:01,370 --> 01:57:07,730
You gave birth to him and
you are the one bringing him up.

2118
01:57:10,370 --> 01:57:13,370
So how can she be his mother?

2119
01:57:14,650 --> 01:57:17,130
Raj might look like a westerner,

2120
01:57:17,650 --> 01:57:19,610
but at heart he is an Indian,
just like us.

2121
01:57:20,770 --> 01:57:22,050
He speaks our language.

2122
01:57:22,130 --> 01:57:23,290
He eats our food.

2123
01:57:23,370 --> 01:57:24,690
So how can he belong to them?

2124
01:57:25,370 --> 01:57:26,610
I have told him that
we want to go ahead with it.

2125
01:57:27,570 --> 01:57:30,570
I'll sell my car if we
need money to fight the case.

2126
01:57:32,810 --> 01:57:34,170
We can also sell this house if required.

2127
01:57:35,250 --> 01:57:36,610
It is quite old.

2128
01:57:36,690 --> 01:57:38,930
We're just four of us.

2129
01:57:39,010 --> 01:57:40,290
We don't need such a big house.

2130
01:57:40,370 --> 01:57:42,370
Raj should go to America,

2131
01:57:45,610 --> 01:57:47,250
with John and Summer.

2132
01:57:50,370 --> 01:57:52,170
How can you say that, Mimi?

2133
01:57:54,370 --> 01:57:55,970
Don't let them beguile you.

2134
01:57:56,650 --> 01:57:58,170
Raj is your son.

2135
01:57:58,770 --> 01:57:59,970
It was my farm,

2136
01:58:02,370 --> 01:58:04,690
but the seed
and manure was theirs

2137
01:58:06,370 --> 01:58:07,970
Have you lost your mind?

2138
01:58:09,770 --> 01:58:11,250
Do you even know what you are saying?

2139
01:58:12,210 --> 01:58:13,370
I know, Mom.

2140
01:58:16,090 --> 01:58:19,090
I just needed
money to go to Mumbai.

2141
01:58:20,370 --> 01:58:22,010
It was Summer who wanted a child.

2142
01:58:24,010 --> 01:58:25,930
She was the one who wanted to be a mother.

2143
01:58:27,810 --> 01:58:29,730
I wanted to be a movie star.

2144
01:58:31,930 --> 01:58:32,810
What about me?

2145
01:58:34,370 --> 01:58:36,930
Have you ever thought about what I wanted?

2146
01:58:38,090 --> 01:58:43,090
I just wanted happiness and
Raj is the one who gave it to me.

2147
01:58:43,730 --> 01:58:45,490
He is my grandson.

2148
01:58:46,770 --> 01:58:49,930
You too considered him as
your son after you gave birth to him.

2149
01:58:50,010 --> 01:58:52,290
Not just you,
we all considered him as your son.

2150
01:58:54,370 --> 01:58:59,010
My wife says, "It's a good thing,
we don't have a child of our own."

2151
01:58:59,090 --> 01:59:01,010
"Raj doesn't have to compete
with anyone for our love."

2152
01:59:02,770 --> 01:59:06,010
We keep looking for excuses
to come and meet him.

2153
01:59:08,730 --> 01:59:10,410
He is the soul of this house.

2154
01:59:11,450 --> 01:59:15,410
We will go to any court we have to.

2155
01:59:15,530 --> 01:59:16,930
We will fight for him.

2156
01:59:17,370 --> 01:59:18,610
What will we gain from it, huh?

2157
01:59:20,970 --> 01:59:27,930
We will fight the case for
years but what will we prove by that?

2158
01:59:28,370 --> 01:59:29,970
That Raj isn't their child?

2159
01:59:31,130 --> 01:59:35,370
Anyone who sees Raj with Summer
and John will now that he is their child.

2160
01:59:37,370 --> 01:59:40,610
They will keep calling Raj to
court and bombard him with questions.

2161
01:59:40,690 --> 01:59:42,050
What will he say?

2162
01:59:44,290 --> 01:59:45,770
He is just a child.

2163
01:59:47,370 --> 01:59:48,250
No.

2164
01:59:48,650 --> 01:59:50,650
I don't want him to go through this.

2165
01:59:52,930 --> 01:59:57,130
Mimi, you have made many wrong decisions.

2166
01:59:58,450 --> 02:00:00,130
Don't make a wrong decision this time.

2167
02:00:01,250 --> 02:00:04,370
Our lives are at stake.

2168
02:00:07,210 --> 02:00:10,370
We cannot take a child
away from his mother, Dad.

2169
02:00:16,290 --> 02:00:18,290
Summer is his real mother, Mom.

2170
02:00:20,690 --> 02:00:22,210
Let her have him.

2171
02:00:45,370 --> 02:00:49,170
"Oh my little birdie,"

2172
02:00:49,250 --> 02:00:52,930
"Oh my little birdie,"

2173
02:00:53,010 --> 02:00:59,610
"Where are you going?"

2174
02:01:00,410 --> 02:01:04,290
"Oh my little birdie,"

2175
02:01:04,370 --> 02:01:07,970
"Oh my little birdie,"

2176
02:01:08,050 --> 02:01:15,010
"Where are you going?"

2177
02:01:15,770 --> 02:01:19,530
"Why are you leaving your home?"

2178
02:01:19,610 --> 02:01:23,290
"Why are you leaving your family?"

2179
02:01:23,370 --> 02:01:28,570
"Why are you leaving your mother?"

2180
02:01:28,650 --> 02:01:31,010
"Oh my child,"

2181
02:01:31,090 --> 02:01:36,370
"Why are you leaving your mother?"

2182
02:01:38,730 --> 02:01:42,530
"Oh my little birdie,"

2183
02:01:42,610 --> 02:01:46,290
"Oh my little birdie,"

2184
02:01:46,370 --> 02:01:53,370
"Where are you going?"

2185
02:02:06,730 --> 02:02:08,210
Mimi!

2186
02:02:12,730 --> 02:02:14,290
Mimi!

2187
02:02:17,010 --> 02:02:18,170
Come here, my boy.

2188
02:02:18,250 --> 02:02:21,650
Mimi, why aren't you coming
with me in the aeroplane?

2189
02:02:22,690 --> 02:02:24,250
- I have a show.
- Yes.

2190
02:02:26,010 --> 02:02:27,410
You love my shows, don't you?

2191
02:02:27,490 --> 02:02:29,530
Yes, I love them.

2192
02:02:30,050 --> 02:02:33,170
I'll finish my show and join you, okay?

2193
02:02:35,530 --> 02:02:37,250
You know what you have to do until then?

2194
02:02:37,370 --> 02:02:42,010
I have to be nice to Aunt
Summer and play with Uncle John.

2195
02:02:42,090 --> 02:02:43,690
I have to be a good boy.

2196
02:02:44,730 --> 02:02:51,690
"Love is a strange thing."

2197
02:02:52,410 --> 02:02:59,410
"It is hard to comprehend."

2198
02:03:00,010 --> 02:03:07,570
"We won't hear you
play in the house again."

2199
02:03:07,650 --> 02:03:14,730
"But your presence will
still be felt everywhere."

2200
02:03:15,370 --> 02:03:21,770
"Our tears will stop one day,"

2201
02:03:21,930 --> 02:03:27,930
"but the void that we
feel will never go away."

2202
02:03:52,010 --> 02:03:55,130
We are going back.

2203
02:03:59,620 --> 02:04:03,250
Raj is your son, Mimi.

2204
02:04:06,970 --> 02:04:09,530
And thats my daughter, over there.

2205
02:04:37,490 --> 02:04:39,490
We drove past an orphanage.

2206
02:04:42,370 --> 02:04:43,610
There she was.

2207
02:04:45,490 --> 02:04:47,010
She was crying,

2208
02:04:49,090 --> 02:04:50,650
as though she was waiting for us.

2209
02:04:56,370 --> 02:04:58,810
She wanted a home and we wanted a child.

2210
02:05:00,370 --> 02:05:04,570
So we met the lawyer, we're adopting her.

2211
02:05:07,930 --> 02:05:09,370
Isn't she cute?

2212
02:05:09,690 --> 02:05:13,410
Summer ji, you are adopting her?

2213
02:05:14,810 --> 02:05:16,130
Yes.

2214
02:05:25,010 --> 02:05:26,370
Mimi,

2215
02:05:27,770 --> 02:05:31,730
I cant forcefully take Raj away from you
and be happy.

2216
02:05:33,290 --> 02:05:34,610
And what about Raj?

2217
02:05:35,370 --> 02:05:36,810
Will he be able to stay with me?

2218
02:05:38,370 --> 02:05:39,690
Without you?

2219
02:05:40,530 --> 02:05:42,210
That's not possible, Mimi.

2220
02:05:43,610 --> 02:05:50,010
You know what I realised
after I saw you with Raj?

2221
02:05:51,970 --> 02:05:56,690
That you don't need to give
birth to a child to be a parent.

2222
02:05:58,370 --> 02:06:06,290
And that you don't need to
have your own child to be a parent.

2223
02:06:06,370 --> 02:06:07,610
Thank you.

2224
02:06:15,050 --> 02:06:16,130
Thanks.

2225
02:06:16,690 --> 02:06:17,770
Thank you.

2226
02:06:22,930 --> 02:06:24,210
Thanks.

2227
02:06:24,770 --> 02:06:29,810
I'll love her just
as much as you love Raj.

2228
02:06:32,170 --> 02:06:33,370
Mimi,

2229
02:06:35,370 --> 02:06:39,090
we hope that we can raise our
little girl the way you raised Raj.

2230
02:06:41,370 --> 02:06:42,410
Hi!

2231
02:06:43,490 --> 02:06:44,970
Hello.

2232
02:06:45,250 --> 02:06:46,370
What is your name?

2233
02:06:46,730 --> 02:06:47,690
Tara.

2234
02:06:47,770 --> 02:06:48,690
Tara.

2235
02:06:49,290 --> 02:06:51,210
Raj, say hello to Tara.

2236
02:06:55,370 --> 02:06:56,370
She is so cute.

2237
02:07:02,010 --> 02:07:05,290
Auntie, I want to go in an aeroplane.

2238
02:07:05,370 --> 02:07:08,930
Raj, just get into my
car and fasten your seatbelt,

2239
02:07:09,010 --> 02:07:11,650
I'll make my car fly like an aeroplane.

2240
02:07:12,410 --> 02:07:15,930
Your granny and your mom
can be your airhostesses.

2241
02:07:17,530 --> 02:07:18,490
Do you have any more questions?

2242
02:07:18,570 --> 02:07:21,730
Mimi, when someone pees in the aeroplane,

2243
02:07:21,810 --> 02:07:24,170
does it fall on the ground?

2244
02:07:31,370 --> 02:07:32,730
See you, Summer ji.

2245
02:07:38,610 --> 02:07:40,930
"They say..."

2246
02:07:42,570 --> 02:07:46,210
"They say what you give is yours..."

2247
02:07:46,450 --> 02:07:50,370
"Play..."

2248
02:07:50,770 --> 02:07:54,410
"In my lap my moonchild."

2249
02:07:54,490 --> 02:07:58,770
"In the middle of the
night I still think of you"

2250
02:07:58,930 --> 02:08:03,010
"I see you in my eyes,
how will I get through?"

2251
02:08:03,090 --> 02:08:06,290
"All I can say is I'm sorry"
