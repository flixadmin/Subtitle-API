1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:05,041
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,701
When I was a child, I saw my mother

3
00:00:07,703 --> 00:00:10,174
- killed by something impossible.
- Run Barry, run!

4
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:13,182
My father went to prison for her murder.

5
00:00:13,184 --> 00:00:17,128
Then an accident made me the impossible.

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,902
To the outside world, I'm
an ordinary forensic scientist,

7
00:00:19,904 --> 00:00:21,976
but secretly, I use my speed

8
00:00:21,978 --> 00:00:24,484
to fight crime and find others like me.

9
00:00:24,486 --> 00:00:27,063
And one day, I'll find
who killed my mother...

10
00:00:27,065 --> 00:00:29,499
- Mom!
- And get justice for my father.

11
00:00:29,501 --> 00:00:32,437
I am The Flash.

12
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:34,073
Previously on The Flash...

13
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:36,779
A honeymoon isn't a honeymoon
without Mai Tais.

14
00:00:36,781 --> 00:00:38,082
Ronnie?

15
00:00:38,084 --> 00:00:39,319
I can't let whatever happened..

16
00:00:39,321 --> 00:00:41,926
Ronnie!

17
00:00:41,928 --> 00:00:43,996
I wanted him to be my husband.

18
00:00:43,998 --> 00:00:46,433
I have watched you be in love with Iris

19
00:00:46,435 --> 00:00:49,537
since you were old enough
to know what love is.

20
00:00:53,343 --> 00:00:56,381
He killed my mom.

21
00:01:24,442 --> 00:01:27,142

00:01:32,033 --> 00:01:33,968
There's only two boxes left.

23
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:36,071
You know, at this rate,
we'll be finished by easter.

24
00:01:38,777 --> 00:01:40,077
Don't even.

25
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:46,586
Okay, the only red-suited dude

26
00:01:46,588 --> 00:01:50,626
I want in this house right now
is Kris Kringle, you got it?

27
00:02:00,508 --> 00:02:03,179
Uh, these ornaments
are not gonna hang themselves.

28
00:02:03,181 --> 00:02:05,548
- Mm-hmm.
- Grandma Esther's recipe...

29
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,886
Light on the bourbon.

30
00:02:07,888 --> 00:02:09,255
Mmm.

31
00:02:09,257 --> 00:02:11,325
I always loved her definition of light.

32
00:02:12,729 --> 00:02:15,901
And the Christmas tradition continues.

33
00:02:15,903 --> 00:02:19,741
Detective West. Yeah?

34
00:02:19,743 --> 00:02:21,876
All right.

35
00:02:23,914 --> 00:02:26,586
Sorry, kids, the D.A.
wants to ask me some questions.

36
00:02:26,588 --> 00:02:29,990
Make sure there's some nog
left for me when I get back.

37
00:02:29,992 --> 00:02:34,896
No promises.

38
00:02:34,898 --> 00:02:37,101
What's happening? Hey.

39
00:02:37,103 --> 00:02:38,536
Come on.

40
00:02:38,538 --> 00:02:40,041
Oh, come on, we're doing this already?

41
00:02:40,043 --> 00:02:41,543
Christmas isn't for a few days.

42
00:02:41,545 --> 00:02:44,212
I couldn't wait any longer.

43
00:02:44,214 --> 00:02:45,748
Oh, wait, me first.

44
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,616
Okay.

45
00:02:58,628 --> 00:02:59,960
My mother's wedding band?

46
00:02:59,962 --> 00:03:01,461
A replica, yeah.

47
00:03:01,463 --> 00:03:03,262
You were devastated
when you lost the real one.

48
00:03:03,264 --> 00:03:05,330
Our fifth-grade field trip...

49
00:03:05,332 --> 00:03:06,631
- To the zoo.
- To the zoo.

50
00:03:06,633 --> 00:03:09,532
You cried for weeks.

51
00:03:09,534 --> 00:03:11,567
Here.

52
00:03:17,207 --> 00:03:18,475
You remembered.

53
00:03:18,477 --> 00:03:21,915
Yeah.

54
00:03:21,917 --> 00:03:24,715
Steel trap.

55
00:03:24,717 --> 00:03:27,917
I don't know what to say.

56
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:30,420
My gift so sucks in comparison...

57
00:03:30,422 --> 00:03:33,256
- Way.
- No.

58
00:03:36,491 --> 00:03:39,999
It's supposed to be
the best one on the market.

59
00:03:40,001 --> 00:03:42,268
I thought you could maybe use a new one.

60
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,468
It's lame, I know.

61
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:46,002
No, no, this is great. I love it.

62
00:03:46,004 --> 00:03:47,803
- Yeah?
- Yeah, of course.

63
00:03:53,846 --> 00:03:55,048
Hey, babe.

64
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:57,584
Hey, Barry. Nice ring.

65
00:03:57,586 --> 00:03:59,553
It's beautiful, isn't it?

66
00:03:59,555 --> 00:04:01,888
It's an exact replica of my mom's.

67
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:06,394
- Barry got it for me.
- That's very thoughtful, Bar.

68
00:04:09,398 --> 00:04:12,832
- So are we tree trimming?
- Yeah.

69
00:04:12,834 --> 00:04:15,235
Come on.

70
00:04:18,438 --> 00:04:19,939
Merry Christmas.

71
00:04:19,941 --> 00:04:20,973
Just a small token

72
00:04:20,975 --> 00:04:22,674
- of my gratitude...
- Aw.

73
00:04:22,676 --> 00:04:25,105
For everything you guys
have done for me this year.

74
00:04:25,107 --> 00:04:26,975
I think I speak on behalf of my colleagues

75
00:04:26,977 --> 00:04:29,811
when I say you've been a gift
for us, Barry.

76
00:04:29,813 --> 00:04:31,713
What's that?

77
00:04:31,715 --> 00:04:35,552
This is compliments of Iris...
Grandma Esther's famous eggnog.

78
00:04:35,554 --> 00:04:38,053
That's what I'm talking about.

79
00:04:38,055 --> 00:04:39,421
Maybe later for me.

80
00:04:39,423 --> 00:04:42,327
Wouldn't want to drink and drive.

81
00:04:42,329 --> 00:04:44,896
Did I say something wrong?

82
00:04:44,898 --> 00:04:46,797
- No.
- No, man.

83
00:04:46,799 --> 00:04:50,134
He, um... this used to be
his favorite time of year,

84
00:04:50,136 --> 00:04:53,605
but the accident
happened before Christmas, so...

85
00:04:53,607 --> 00:04:54,907
Kind of ruined the holidays.

86
00:04:54,909 --> 00:04:56,610
I'm gonna go get him a present.

87
00:04:56,612 --> 00:04:58,512
Maybe that'll cheer him up.

88
00:04:58,514 --> 00:04:59,947
Thank you very much.

89
00:04:59,949 --> 00:05:01,415
Yeah.

90
00:05:01,417 --> 00:05:04,119
So what are you doing for Christmas, Cisco?

91
00:05:11,795 --> 00:05:13,797
The fact that I asked you
for your shirt size

92
00:05:13,799 --> 00:05:15,498
should in no way indicate

93
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,799
that I am getting you something
shirt-related for Christmas.

94
00:05:19,801 --> 00:05:22,465
Barry seemed a little odd today.

95
00:05:22,467 --> 00:05:25,033
I'm pretty sure
he wasn't psyched I came by.

96
00:05:25,035 --> 00:05:26,902
You ever think...

97
00:05:26,904 --> 00:05:31,137
He maybe might like you?

98
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:33,206
What? No.

99
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,408
Friends don't give friends wedding bands.

100
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:38,412
He was... he wasn't proposing to me, silly.

101
00:05:38,414 --> 00:05:41,484
He and I are just best friends.

102
00:05:41,486 --> 00:05:44,520
Well, then he won't be bothered by this.

103
00:05:46,924 --> 00:05:50,594
A bit early, but I couldn't wait.

104
00:05:58,674 --> 00:06:01,611
I figured we've been together a year now.

105
00:06:01,613 --> 00:06:04,447
You pretty much stay there
most nights anyway.

106
00:06:07,184 --> 00:06:09,086
I love you.

107
00:06:09,088 --> 00:06:11,857
That's a yes, I take it?

108
00:06:16,596 --> 00:06:18,065
It was that

109
00:06:18,067 --> 00:06:19,667
or Stephen Hawking's new autobiography,

110
00:06:19,669 --> 00:06:23,374
and we both know
how he feels about Hawking.

111
00:06:23,376 --> 00:06:27,176
Okay, I'll talk to you later. Bye, Cisco.

112
00:07:20,537 --> 00:07:22,138
Merry Christmas, doc.

113
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:25,578
Thank you, Jimmy, and to you.

114
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,315
Hey, doc, I know it's a big secret,

115
00:07:27,317 --> 00:07:28,816
but can you give me a hint?

116
00:07:28,818 --> 00:07:32,784
What exactly are you working on in there?

117
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,351
The future.

118
00:07:36,086 --> 00:07:37,518
Doctor, get inside!

119
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,052
Lock down the facility!

120
00:08:00,476 --> 00:08:02,111
Hey.

121
00:08:02,113 --> 00:08:04,978
What are you thinking?

122
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:08,217
The blood splatter patterns
and trajectory of the remains...

123
00:08:08,219 --> 00:08:10,454
only a high-speed collision
could have done this.

124
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:13,923
But to cause this type of damage
to a human in this space?

125
00:08:13,925 --> 00:08:17,296
Whatever hit them would have
to have been moving fast.

126
00:08:17,298 --> 00:08:18,865
Get this.

127
00:08:18,867 --> 00:08:20,764
The witness says all he saw was a blur.

128
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:22,936
Sound familiar?

129
00:08:27,509 --> 00:08:29,077
You saw a blur?

130
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:30,645
W... What was it?

131
00:08:30,647 --> 00:08:33,082
Whatever it was,
it was looking for something.

132
00:08:33,084 --> 00:08:35,688
Well, what did it look like?

133
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:39,857
Like a-a man in some kind of yellow suit.

134
00:08:39,859 --> 00:08:42,260
Okay.

135
00:08:42,262 --> 00:08:44,363
- Barry, listen...
- I have to check my files.

136
00:08:44,365 --> 00:08:45,798
Joe, you heard him, all right?

137
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,167
The man that killed my mom... he's back.

138
00:08:47,169 --> 00:08:48,603
I know.

139
00:08:48,605 --> 00:08:50,841
He's been in town for a few weeks now.

140
00:08:50,843 --> 00:08:52,408
He paid a visit to me at the house.

141
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:53,876
He took all the evidence
from your mom's case.

142
00:08:53,878 --> 00:08:55,310
The files are gone.

143
00:08:55,312 --> 00:08:56,979
Why wouldn't you tell me this sooner?

144
00:08:56,981 --> 00:08:58,914
- I couldn't.
- Why?

145
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:02,284
Because he threatened to kill Iris.

146
00:09:11,933 --> 00:09:15,999
The witness described seeing a yellow blur

147
00:09:16,001 --> 00:09:17,932
just like the one
that killed Barry's mother.

148
00:09:17,934 --> 00:09:21,105
Then we need to get cracking
and stop this speed psycho.

149
00:09:21,107 --> 00:09:23,706
That... I wasn't trying to give him a name.

150
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:25,573
The crime scene
at Mercury Labs was on a floor

151
00:09:25,575 --> 00:09:27,273
with highly secured vaults,

152
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:29,341
and the witness said
he was looking for something.

153
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:31,744
Whatever it was, he wanted it
badly enough to kill for it.

154
00:09:31,746 --> 00:09:33,712
Doctor, what do you know
about this Mercury Labs?

155
00:09:33,714 --> 00:09:36,681
Mercury was one of S.T.A.R. Labs'

156
00:09:36,683 --> 00:09:38,849
major competitors until our little setback,

157
00:09:38,851 --> 00:09:41,084
and then it catapulted to the forefront

158
00:09:41,086 --> 00:09:43,752
led by Dr. Christina McGee,

159
00:09:43,754 --> 00:09:46,387
brilliant but egocentric physicist.

160
00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:50,560
it says here Dr. McGee has
secured half a billion dollars

161
00:09:50,562 --> 00:09:52,496
in private funding to develop,

162
00:09:52,498 --> 00:09:56,300
and I quote, “prototypes for
the technology of the future.”

163
00:09:56,302 --> 00:09:58,236
well, I'll be.

164
00:09:58,238 --> 00:10:02,544
Tina's messing with tachyons,
superluminal particles.

165
00:10:02,546 --> 00:10:04,011
Of course.

166
00:10:04,013 --> 00:10:06,247
So what could someone
do with one of those...

167
00:10:06,249 --> 00:10:08,850
- Tachyons.
- Thank you.

168
00:10:08,852 --> 00:10:11,486
Well, I don't know. Become invincible?

169
00:10:11,488 --> 00:10:14,023
if you could devise a matrix stable enough

170
00:10:14,025 --> 00:10:17,930
to harness their power, you
could travel faster than light.

171
00:10:17,932 --> 00:10:19,698
He's gonna try to get them again,

172
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,135
so we need to get what Mercury
has and use it as a lure.

173
00:10:22,137 --> 00:10:25,071
Exactly right. Cisco, Caitlin,
let's start engineering a trap.

174
00:10:25,073 --> 00:10:26,673
- You got it.
- Of course.

175
00:10:29,843 --> 00:10:33,112
Thanks.

176
00:10:33,114 --> 00:10:34,747
Iris.

177
00:10:34,749 --> 00:10:36,615
Caitlin. What are you doing here?

178
00:10:36,617 --> 00:10:37,984
Oh, it's been a long day.

179
00:10:37,986 --> 00:10:39,921
It's only noon.

180
00:10:39,923 --> 00:10:41,791
I didn't sleep much last night.

181
00:10:41,793 --> 00:10:43,726
Yeah, me either.

182
00:10:43,728 --> 00:10:46,194
Um, so I was catching up on your blog,

183
00:10:46,196 --> 00:10:48,395
and this story caught my eye...

184
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:52,970
about a man whose head
and hands burst into flames?

185
00:10:52,972 --> 00:10:54,603
- The burning man?
- Yeah.

186
00:10:54,605 --> 00:10:56,704
I haven't really updated
that story in a while,

187
00:10:56,706 --> 00:10:58,972
but there are some reports
that I could send you.

188
00:10:58,974 --> 00:11:01,106
That'd be great. Thank you.

189
00:11:01,108 --> 00:11:03,977
Can I ask you something, girl-to-girl?

190
00:11:03,979 --> 00:11:05,511
Sure.

191
00:11:05,513 --> 00:11:08,649
Barry's been acting different
around me lately,

192
00:11:08,651 --> 00:11:12,420
like he's keeping
some sort of secret from me.

193
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:14,190
is there anything that you know about

194
00:11:14,192 --> 00:11:15,357
that I should know about?

195
00:11:15,359 --> 00:11:17,792
Not that I can think of.

196
00:11:17,794 --> 00:11:19,262
However, if you feel

197
00:11:19,264 --> 00:11:21,766
like Barry's keeping something from you,

198
00:11:21,768 --> 00:11:24,602
you should probably just ask him yourself.

199
00:11:24,604 --> 00:11:25,837
Yeah.

200
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,309
- Thanks.
- Of course.

201
00:11:29,311 --> 00:11:32,146
- Yeah, okay.
- Gonna get some caffeine.

202
00:11:33,448 --> 00:11:35,415
Barry Allen. Thank you for coming in.

203
00:11:35,417 --> 00:11:36,950
Dr. Tina McGee.

204
00:11:36,952 --> 00:11:39,153
I assume this is
about last night's break-in?

205
00:11:39,155 --> 00:11:41,089
Well, yes and no.

206
00:11:41,091 --> 00:11:42,490
That's usually how things are
with you, aren't they, Harrison?

207
00:11:42,492 --> 00:11:44,326
We believe that whoever broke in

208
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:45,961
was after one of your prototypes.

209
00:11:45,963 --> 00:11:47,697
You'll have to narrow that down.

210
00:11:47,699 --> 00:11:49,400
We have literally hundreds
of projects in development.

211
00:11:49,402 --> 00:11:52,072
One containing tachyonic particles.

212
00:11:52,074 --> 00:11:54,808
We've had encouraging success
with tachyons, yes,

213
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:57,845
but there's still a significant
gap between our prototype

214
00:11:57,847 --> 00:11:59,579
and any real-life application.

215
00:11:59,581 --> 00:12:02,678
We were hoping
you would lend us your prototype

216
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,345
to use as a lure.

217
00:12:04,347 --> 00:12:05,848
“Us”?

218
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,619
You're assisting the police now, Harrison?

219
00:12:07,621 --> 00:12:09,956
I'm consulting on this particular case.

220
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:11,688
Listen, Tina, once this man is apprehended,

221
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,423
your prototype will be promptly returned.

222
00:12:13,425 --> 00:12:15,360
You know nobody wants to ensure

223
00:12:15,362 --> 00:12:18,730
the future's technology more than me.

224
00:12:18,732 --> 00:12:20,998
I appreciate the CCPD's
concerns, Mr. Allen,

225
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,138
but Mercury is quite capable
of protecting its own assets.

226
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:28,341
Good luck with your manhunt.

227
00:12:37,483 --> 00:12:39,917
Hey, Caitlin, check this out.

228
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:43,591
I think we can fashion
an electronic barrier, right?

229
00:12:43,593 --> 00:12:45,991
We set up a ton of super capacitors.

230
00:12:45,993 --> 00:12:47,559
We smooth out the inflection points,

231
00:12:47,561 --> 00:12:49,093
and voila...

232
00:12:49,095 --> 00:12:53,728
a kick-ass force field
to trap the opposite Flash.

233
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:56,333
That was me testing out a name.

234
00:12:56,335 --> 00:12:57,967
What do you think?

235
00:13:00,667 --> 00:13:03,134
Are you okay?

236
00:13:05,837 --> 00:13:07,802
Ronnie's alive.

237
00:13:07,804 --> 00:13:09,835
I saw him, Cisco.

238
00:13:09,837 --> 00:13:12,474
I think he was following me.

239
00:13:12,476 --> 00:13:15,010
Caitlin...

240
00:13:15,012 --> 00:13:17,244
Ronnie died.

241
00:13:17,246 --> 00:13:19,446
He was vaporized

242
00:13:19,448 --> 00:13:21,315
in the accelerator when it went critical.

243
00:13:21,317 --> 00:13:22,651
Ronnie's alive,

244
00:13:22,653 --> 00:13:27,553
and he's out there alone and scared,

245
00:13:27,555 --> 00:13:31,624
and I need your help to find him.

246
00:13:44,207 --> 00:13:46,409
- Ouch.
- Hmm...

247
00:13:46,411 --> 00:13:49,579
- Your bruise is already healing.
- It still hurts, though.

248
00:13:49,581 --> 00:13:52,179
Not for much longer, honey.

249
00:13:52,181 --> 00:13:54,182
Here, come on.

250
00:13:57,654 --> 00:13:59,386
I'll keep the light on for you.

251
00:13:59,388 --> 00:14:03,658
Were you ever afraid of the dark?

252
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,592
if I turn this light off now,

253
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:08,294
- would you be scared?
- No.

254
00:14:08,296 --> 00:14:10,065
That's because I'm here with you.

255
00:14:10,067 --> 00:14:13,502
See, you're not afraid of the dark, Barry.

256
00:14:13,504 --> 00:14:15,969
You're afraid of being alone in the dark,

257
00:14:15,971 --> 00:14:19,640
and that goes away
when you realize something.

258
00:14:19,642 --> 00:14:23,476
You're never really alone.

259
00:14:23,478 --> 00:14:25,143
it's time for bed.

260
00:14:25,145 --> 00:14:26,645
I'm thirsty.

261
00:14:26,647 --> 00:14:28,514
Oh, no, you're stalling.

262
00:14:28,516 --> 00:14:31,083
But I got you covered, buddy.

263
00:14:31,085 --> 00:14:33,285
Good night, slugger.

264
00:14:37,523 --> 00:14:40,025
Sweet dreams, my beautiful boy.

265
00:14:49,603 --> 00:14:52,773
You can turn off the light.

266
00:15:07,751 --> 00:15:10,319
Mom! Mom!

267
00:15:10,321 --> 00:15:13,321
Nora!

268
00:15:13,323 --> 00:15:16,456
Barry.

269
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:19,092
I called your name, like...

270
00:15:20,898 --> 00:15:22,467
Your mom's case.

271
00:15:22,469 --> 00:15:26,739
I used to study this board every day.

272
00:15:26,741 --> 00:15:28,874
Lately, I haven't looked at it

273
00:15:28,876 --> 00:15:31,778
as much as I should have.

274
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:34,283
I didn't know you did that.

275
00:15:34,285 --> 00:15:37,485
I guess there's still some
stuff about me you don't know.

276
00:15:40,925 --> 00:15:45,127
Eddie asked me to move in with him.

277
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:48,132
I said yes.

278
00:15:48,134 --> 00:15:51,032
Wow.

279
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:55,937
You guys are moving pretty fast, huh?

280
00:15:55,939 --> 00:15:59,441
Well, I mean, it's been a year.

281
00:15:59,443 --> 00:16:03,181
Eddie thought you
might feel weird about it.

282
00:16:05,017 --> 00:16:07,751
Wha... I don't...

283
00:16:07,753 --> 00:16:11,187
why would he say that?

284
00:16:11,189 --> 00:16:13,857
He thinks that you...

285
00:16:13,859 --> 00:16:16,630
Like me romantically.

286
00:16:16,632 --> 00:16:19,266
I mean, honestly, it sounds even silly

287
00:16:19,268 --> 00:16:22,702
suggesting it. Um...

288
00:16:22,704 --> 00:16:24,038
I mean, Eddie's wrong.

289
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,808
I... and if I've seemed weird before,

290
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:32,715
it's just that this year
has gone by really fast,

291
00:16:32,717 --> 00:16:34,815
and I guess I didn't realize

292
00:16:34,817 --> 00:16:37,953
how far along in
your relationship you guys were.

293
00:16:40,225 --> 00:16:42,991
That's what I told him.

294
00:16:42,993 --> 00:16:45,395
Well, I guess

295
00:16:45,397 --> 00:16:48,566
I should get going.

296
00:16:48,568 --> 00:16:50,736
Bye.

297
00:17:29,455 --> 00:17:31,558
It was you.

298
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:35,260
You were the one in my house that night.

299
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:37,427
You killed my mother!

300
00:17:37,429 --> 00:17:39,029
Why?

301
00:17:39,031 --> 00:17:41,766
if you want to know that,

302
00:17:41,768 --> 00:17:44,233
you're gonna have to catch me.

303
00:18:28,852 --> 00:18:31,686
Not fast enough, Flash.

304
00:18:46,971 --> 00:18:50,675
- Who are you?
- You know who I am, Barry.

305
00:18:57,686 --> 00:18:59,421
I don't know who you are.

306
00:18:59,423 --> 00:19:00,857
But you do, Barry.

307
00:19:00,859 --> 00:19:03,364
We've been at this a long time, you and I,

308
00:19:03,366 --> 00:19:06,635
but I'm always one step ahead.

309
00:19:12,312 --> 00:19:14,881
it is your destiny to lose to me, Flash,

310
00:19:14,883 --> 00:19:17,018
just as it was your mother's destiny

311
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:19,221
to die that night.

312
00:19:34,511 --> 00:19:37,512
He acted like he knew me,
like we'd done this before.

313
00:19:37,514 --> 00:19:39,015
He was antagonizing you, bar.

314
00:19:39,017 --> 00:19:40,951
I would get close, and he'd just pull away.

315
00:19:40,953 --> 00:19:43,089
I mean, this was
just some sick game to him.

316
00:19:43,091 --> 00:19:44,526
You'll catch him. We'll help.

317
00:19:44,528 --> 00:19:45,795
No, you don't get it, all right?

318
00:19:45,797 --> 00:19:48,098
His speed, it is... it's beyond me.

319
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,468
I'm not the fastest man alive. He is.

320
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:53,539
So how do we catch somebody
that even I can't keep up with?

321
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:55,776
The beautiful thing
about force fields, Mr. Allen,

322
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:57,345
is they're impervious to speed.

323
00:19:57,347 --> 00:19:59,914
Now, we're almost finished
fabricating the trap,

324
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:01,614
and all that remains is for detective west

325
00:20:01,616 --> 00:20:04,016
- to procure the bait.
- I'm on it.

326
00:20:05,451 --> 00:20:07,085
Barry, why don't you stay here?

327
00:20:07,087 --> 00:20:10,456
No, Joe, today is not the day
to tell me to stay behind.

328
00:20:16,197 --> 00:20:17,964
if Judge Hankerson was gonna sign this,

329
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,900
he would have done so already.

330
00:20:19,902 --> 00:20:22,000
Look, I'm sure you don't want
this investigation

331
00:20:22,002 --> 00:20:24,365
to get any more public than it's
already been, do you, doctor?

332
00:20:24,367 --> 00:20:25,766
This has Harrison Wells

333
00:20:25,768 --> 00:20:27,268
written all over it in big, black letters.

334
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:31,639
I am not giving you my tachyon prototype.

335
00:20:31,641 --> 00:20:34,245
it was quite the tour
of your facility, doctor.

336
00:20:34,247 --> 00:20:36,783
You were fine to let
us dumb cops walk around,

337
00:20:36,785 --> 00:20:38,852
but I majored in physics and chemistry,

338
00:20:38,854 --> 00:20:40,586
and I saw a whole lot of stuff

339
00:20:40,588 --> 00:20:42,957
that Sciencieshowcase Magazine
would love to hear about.

340
00:20:42,959 --> 00:20:45,696
So should I call their editors directly

341
00:20:45,698 --> 00:20:49,966
or just leave a few posts on their website?

342
00:20:49,968 --> 00:20:53,339
You'll have the tachyon device
within the hour.

343
00:20:53,341 --> 00:20:56,541
I see why Harrison holds you
in such esteem, Mr. Allen.

344
00:20:56,543 --> 00:20:58,376
You're very much alike.

345
00:21:02,515 --> 00:21:05,516
Nicely done.

346
00:21:07,152 --> 00:21:10,055
- Hey, Joe, you got a second?
- Not now, Eddie.

347
00:21:10,057 --> 00:21:12,725
I read the witness statement.
The Flash was there.

348
00:21:12,727 --> 00:21:14,294
I know you got something in the works.

349
00:21:14,296 --> 00:21:16,264
Yeah, but you don't want any part of this.

350
00:21:16,266 --> 00:21:18,400
I've got a task force
approved to capture him,

351
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:20,569
and I want in.

352
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:23,005
I'm not asking permission, Joe.

353
00:21:23,007 --> 00:21:24,440
Excuse me?

354
00:21:24,442 --> 00:21:25,910
if my task force isn't a part of this,

355
00:21:25,912 --> 00:21:27,844
I'll go to Captain Singh.

356
00:21:27,846 --> 00:21:29,511
I'll tell him something's going on,

357
00:21:29,513 --> 00:21:31,546
and you're not talking... I'm sorry.

358
00:21:31,548 --> 00:21:36,154
You'd do the same thing if you were me.

359
00:21:36,156 --> 00:21:38,892
Fine.

360
00:21:41,761 --> 00:21:43,363
We follow the ionized particles,

361
00:21:43,365 --> 00:21:45,865
and that should lead us right to him.

362
00:21:45,867 --> 00:21:49,001
The CPMs are increasing.

363
00:21:50,972 --> 00:21:53,644
We should have told Dr. Wells and Barry.

364
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:56,080
No, not until we're sure it's him.

365
00:21:58,582 --> 00:22:00,816
Oh, wow.

366
00:22:00,818 --> 00:22:05,521
Look, Ronnie is not
like you remembered him.

367
00:22:07,221 --> 00:22:08,921
What does that mean?

368
00:22:08,923 --> 00:22:12,729
Just don't freak out
when you see him, okay?

369
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:16,502
Oh, I really wish that was
because the batteries were dead.

370
00:22:26,615 --> 00:22:30,018
Ronnie?

371
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:34,585
Ronnie, it's me, Cait.

372
00:22:34,587 --> 00:22:36,986
Look, I brought Cisco with me.

373
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:40,187
We're here to help you.

374
00:22:40,189 --> 00:22:43,123
You were in an accident. Do you remember?

375
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:46,558
I'm not Ronnie.

376
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:50,159
Yes, you are. You're Ronnie Raymond.

377
00:22:50,161 --> 00:22:53,495
I'm not Ronnie. I told you that.

378
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:55,297
Now get away from me.

379
00:22:55,299 --> 00:22:57,766
Look, we just need to take you back

380
00:22:57,768 --> 00:22:59,399
to S.T.A.R. Labs.

381
00:22:59,401 --> 00:23:03,134
We'll help you remember who you are.

382
00:23:03,136 --> 00:23:05,871
Firestorm.

383
00:23:18,303 --> 00:23:20,405
The tachyon device is in place.

384
00:23:20,407 --> 00:23:22,173
You think it'll work?

385
00:23:22,175 --> 00:23:24,742
It'll work.

386
00:23:26,379 --> 00:23:29,580
So how do we advertise to him
that the prototype's here?

387
00:23:29,582 --> 00:23:32,381
We'll take care of that.

388
00:23:36,153 --> 00:23:39,453
What's the problem?

389
00:23:39,455 --> 00:23:41,522
Look, Barry...

390
00:23:41,524 --> 00:23:45,026
Me and Dr. Wells have spoken, and...

391
00:23:45,028 --> 00:23:49,065
We think it would be best
if you weren't here for this.

392
00:23:49,067 --> 00:23:50,867
What are you talking about?

393
00:23:50,869 --> 00:23:52,370
You're too close to this.

394
00:23:52,372 --> 00:23:54,241
Or maybe you're not close enough.

395
00:23:54,243 --> 00:23:55,643
If you hadn't been too scared

396
00:23:55,645 --> 00:23:57,277
and warned me that he was here weeks ago,

397
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,178
I could have been prepared for this.

398
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:02,249
I think we can all appreciate
Joe's concern for Iris, Barry.

399
00:24:02,251 --> 00:24:03,684
That's why I have to be here!

400
00:24:03,686 --> 00:24:05,319
I'm the best chance at catching this guy!

401
00:24:05,321 --> 00:24:09,191
Not right now, not in this state.

402
00:24:09,193 --> 00:24:12,029
This man stabbed my mother
through the heart

403
00:24:12,031 --> 00:24:14,633
and sent my father to prison for it.

404
00:24:14,635 --> 00:24:16,902
This is my fight.

405
00:24:16,904 --> 00:24:20,507
Not today, son.

406
00:24:44,579 --> 00:24:47,449
Caitlin...

407
00:24:47,451 --> 00:24:49,519
Don't worry.

408
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:51,288
Hey.

409
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:54,490
Now that we know he's out there,
we will find Ronnie again.

410
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:57,623
Why... so we can throw him in there

411
00:24:57,625 --> 00:25:01,027
with all the other meta-human psychos?

412
00:25:03,929 --> 00:25:08,199
I used to play this game in my head.

413
00:25:08,201 --> 00:25:12,703
What would I give up for just
one more minute with him?

414
00:25:15,942 --> 00:25:19,278
My house, my career...

415
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,645
The rest of my life?

416
00:25:23,817 --> 00:25:27,585
Today I finally got that minute.

417
00:25:27,587 --> 00:25:30,423
And I wish I hadn't.

418
00:25:30,425 --> 00:25:34,192
Seeing him like that, what he's become...

419
00:25:35,694 --> 00:25:38,296
Dear God...

420
00:25:38,298 --> 00:25:41,231
I wish he had just died that day.

421
00:25:41,233 --> 00:25:44,702
Oh.

422
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,527
Merry Christmas, Slugger.

423
00:26:06,529 --> 00:26:11,433
Merry Christmas.

424
00:26:11,435 --> 00:26:16,205
You all right, Barry?

425
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:19,107
I screwed up, dad.

426
00:26:19,109 --> 00:26:23,577
After years of searching...

427
00:26:23,579 --> 00:26:25,978
I finally found him.

428
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:30,382
I found the man who killed mom...

429
00:26:30,384 --> 00:26:33,785
The man in yellow,
the one in the lightning.

430
00:26:33,787 --> 00:26:39,019
He's out there, and I had him.

431
00:26:39,021 --> 00:26:42,358
He got away.

432
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:46,062
I... I was so close.

433
00:26:49,637 --> 00:26:53,977
I promised you that
I would get you out of here.

434
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:57,918
Every day you spend in here
has been because of him...

435
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,990
Until today.

436
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:04,594
Now you're in here
because of me, and I'm so sorry.

437
00:27:04,596 --> 00:27:07,033
I...

438
00:27:09,603 --> 00:27:12,307
Barry.

439
00:27:12,309 --> 00:27:16,775
Barry, this is not your fault.

440
00:27:16,777 --> 00:27:18,809
Look at me.

441
00:27:18,811 --> 00:27:21,781
I know what you've given up.

442
00:27:21,783 --> 00:27:24,614
Every decision you've made
in the past 14 years

443
00:27:24,616 --> 00:27:26,316
has been because of me and your mom...

444
00:27:26,318 --> 00:27:27,652
what you studied,

445
00:27:27,654 --> 00:27:32,121
why you became a CSI, even with Iris.

446
00:27:32,123 --> 00:27:35,329
- Iris?
- You're my son.

447
00:27:35,331 --> 00:27:38,664
You don't think I know how you love her?

448
00:27:38,666 --> 00:27:41,367
But you never pursued her

449
00:27:41,369 --> 00:27:43,971
because you were too consumed
with what happened to me

450
00:27:43,973 --> 00:27:46,141
and your mom to let yourself have a life.

451
00:27:46,143 --> 00:27:49,479
Well, let it go now, Barry.

452
00:27:49,481 --> 00:27:52,348
Hear me now.

453
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:56,019
The man in the yellow suit...

454
00:27:56,021 --> 00:27:59,092
Has taken enough from us already.

455
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:04,432
Don't let him take any more.

456
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:26,116
Hey.

457
00:28:26,118 --> 00:28:27,250
Just in time.

458
00:28:27,252 --> 00:28:29,686
I am almost done.

459
00:28:29,688 --> 00:28:32,255
Are there awards for tree trimming?

460
00:28:32,257 --> 00:28:35,225
Because this is award-worthy.

461
00:28:38,966 --> 00:28:42,070
Are you okay, Bar?

462
00:28:52,891 --> 00:28:54,858
I love you, Iris.

463
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:57,362
Oh, I love you too.

464
00:29:04,172 --> 00:29:05,674
When we were kids, I loved you

465
00:29:05,676 --> 00:29:09,144
before I even knew
what the word “love” meant.

466
00:29:09,146 --> 00:29:10,814
And then my mom died,

467
00:29:10,816 --> 00:29:14,650
and I had to go live with
the girl that I had a crush on.

468
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:23,326
Look, I... there were so many times

469
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:25,096
that I wanted to tell you...

470
00:29:25,098 --> 00:29:28,335
Junior prom, when I went away to college,

471
00:29:28,337 --> 00:29:29,968
when I came back from college,

472
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:32,771
nights that we stayed up
talking, all the birthdays,

473
00:29:32,773 --> 00:29:36,178
all the christmases, but I... I never did.

474
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:40,383
I just... I kept it in.

475
00:29:40,385 --> 00:29:42,618
After I lost my mom and my dad,

476
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:46,660
I was afraid that if you
didn't feel the same way,

477
00:29:46,662 --> 00:29:50,431
I would lose you, too.

478
00:29:50,433 --> 00:29:51,766
That's the irony.

479
00:29:51,768 --> 00:29:56,273
I was so scared of losing you that I did.

480
00:29:56,275 --> 00:29:59,274
I know I've had our whole lives
to tell you this,

481
00:29:59,276 --> 00:30:01,143
and you're with Eddie now, and I know that,

482
00:30:01,145 --> 00:30:03,080
and I know my timing couldn't be any worse,

483
00:30:03,082 --> 00:30:05,647
but I just...

484
00:30:05,649 --> 00:30:08,585
I couldn't lie to you any more.

485
00:30:13,761 --> 00:30:16,030
I'm sorry.

486
00:30:22,507 --> 00:30:25,775
Okay.

487
00:30:36,057 --> 00:30:39,361
Sending out another pulse.

488
00:30:41,665 --> 00:30:43,601
Are you certain this trap will work?

489
00:30:43,603 --> 00:30:45,638
I've sent up at least three
charges into open satellite.

490
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,874
if anyone's looking tachyonic particles,

491
00:30:47,876 --> 00:30:49,843
they'll know we got them.

492
00:31:06,896 --> 00:31:09,732
Let's see what we caught.

493
00:31:23,247 --> 00:31:25,848
Cisco? Lights.

494
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:29,054
Sure thing, Dr. Wells.

495
00:31:36,431 --> 00:31:40,834
Detective Thawne, would you
like to read him his rights?

496
00:31:42,804 --> 00:31:45,474
Joe, what are you doing?

497
00:31:45,476 --> 00:31:49,977
Getting some answers.

498
00:31:49,979 --> 00:31:54,350
14 years ago, you murdered Nora Allen.

499
00:31:54,352 --> 00:31:55,886
I want to know why.

500
00:31:55,888 --> 00:31:58,790
Why?

501
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:03,462
Dr. Wells, we meet at last.

502
00:32:03,464 --> 00:32:05,929
What do you want
with the tachyonic particles?

503
00:32:05,931 --> 00:32:09,332
My goals are beyond your understanding.

504
00:32:09,334 --> 00:32:13,068
Oh, I don't know, I'm a pretty smart guy.

505
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:14,770
I knew you were exceptionally fast,

506
00:32:14,772 --> 00:32:17,508
so any trap we manufactured
would have to be invisible.

507
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:18,909
I knew your cells

508
00:32:18,911 --> 00:32:21,611
could repair themselves
at extraordinary speeds,

509
00:32:21,613 --> 00:32:23,278
so you could withstand

510
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,112
the damage this is doing
to your body right now.

511
00:32:26,114 --> 00:32:27,346
The super capacitors...

512
00:32:27,348 --> 00:32:29,114
the containment field is fluctuating.

513
00:32:29,116 --> 00:32:30,716
They need to get out of there now.

514
00:32:30,718 --> 00:32:33,449
The reason I know all this
is because your powers

515
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:36,819
are almost exactly like those of The Flash.

516
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:39,585
Oh, I'm not like The Flash at all.

517
00:32:39,587 --> 00:32:43,252
Some would say I'm the reverse.

518
00:32:43,254 --> 00:32:44,821
Dr. Wells, evacuate!

519
00:32:44,823 --> 00:32:46,488
Get out of there now!

520
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:48,054
Dr. Wells!

521
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:57,796
Cisco, turn off the barrier!

522
00:32:57,798 --> 00:32:59,898
If I turn it off,
that thing's gonna get out.

523
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:02,635
Cisco, he's gonna kill Wells!

524
00:33:12,213 --> 00:33:15,083
Find him!

525
00:33:28,226 --> 00:33:31,561
Don't move, or we will shoot.

526
00:33:41,301 --> 00:33:43,703
I warned you not to hunt me.

527
00:34:16,461 --> 00:34:18,995
Barry!

528
00:34:32,205 --> 00:34:34,240
Our race is not yet done.

529
00:34:34,242 --> 00:34:36,644
See you soon, Flash.

530
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:49,082
Don't look for me again.

531
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:13,346
Why did it...

532
00:35:13,348 --> 00:35:15,948
Not kill me?

533
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:18,018
I don't know, Eddie.

534
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:20,522
But you know more
than you've been telling me.

535
00:35:36,668 --> 00:35:39,603
They're called meta-humans.

536
00:35:39,605 --> 00:35:42,403
“Meta-humans”?

537
00:35:42,405 --> 00:35:47,040
People with very powerful abilities.

538
00:35:47,042 --> 00:35:50,042
You and me are the only guys

539
00:35:50,044 --> 00:35:53,946
on the force that know
what's really going on.

540
00:35:53,948 --> 00:35:56,914
And we need to keep it that way...

541
00:35:56,916 --> 00:35:59,583
So nobody else gets hurt.

542
00:36:01,754 --> 00:36:05,126
Can you do that?

543
00:36:11,532 --> 00:36:14,068
And The Flash?

544
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:17,305
Do you know who he is?

545
00:36:22,678 --> 00:36:25,177
Yeah, I do.

546
00:36:27,482 --> 00:36:30,786
He's the guy that saved
both of our lives tonight.

547
00:36:40,899 --> 00:36:42,732
I've been going over the data,

548
00:36:42,734 --> 00:36:44,633
and I still don't know why
the containment system failed.

549
00:36:44,635 --> 00:36:47,101
I must have missed something.

550
00:36:47,103 --> 00:36:48,269
I'm sorry.

551
00:36:48,271 --> 00:36:50,505
it's not your fault, Cisco.

552
00:36:50,507 --> 00:36:54,509
But if you both feel the need
to apologize for something,

553
00:36:54,511 --> 00:36:56,644
you might start with the not telling me

554
00:36:56,646 --> 00:36:59,378
that Ronnie is still alive.

555
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:02,414
I asked Cisco not to say anything.

556
00:37:02,416 --> 00:37:05,651
Once I saw what Ronnie had become,

557
00:37:05,653 --> 00:37:08,454
I needed...

558
00:37:08,456 --> 00:37:11,925
I needed time to see
if I could make him whole again.

559
00:37:11,927 --> 00:37:14,025
I'm sorry. I know you're mad.

560
00:37:14,027 --> 00:37:15,794
No.

561
00:37:15,796 --> 00:37:17,832
I don't know what I would have
done differently

562
00:37:17,834 --> 00:37:20,869
in your situation.

563
00:37:20,871 --> 00:37:24,038
I know I have made you a lot of promises.

564
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,774
I know I've not been able to keep them all.

565
00:37:26,776 --> 00:37:31,479
But on my life, I promise you this...

566
00:37:31,481 --> 00:37:35,216
We will bring Ronnie home.

567
00:37:40,828 --> 00:37:42,596
Hey, bar.

568
00:37:45,134 --> 00:37:48,371
You know my mom traveled
around the world twice?

569
00:37:48,373 --> 00:37:51,712
She spent a semester abroad in Spain,

570
00:37:51,714 --> 00:37:54,548
and she loved it so much
that after she graduated,

571
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:56,483
she went to Europe.

572
00:37:56,485 --> 00:38:01,053
Didn't stop till she'd been
to a few dozen other cities.

573
00:38:02,789 --> 00:38:07,060
She always wanted to go back,
but she never got a chance.

574
00:38:07,062 --> 00:38:12,002
I offered to send you abroad
when you were in college.

575
00:38:12,004 --> 00:38:13,404
Yeah, I know. I remember.

576
00:38:13,406 --> 00:38:15,506
I...

577
00:38:15,508 --> 00:38:19,043
I couldn't take off.

578
00:38:19,045 --> 00:38:21,547
I mean, the truth is

579
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:24,750
I'm stuck here...

580
00:38:24,752 --> 00:38:27,355
in Central City.

581
00:38:27,357 --> 00:38:32,326
Fear has kept me in that
living room for 14 years.

582
00:38:36,568 --> 00:38:40,332
Joe, I... I was mad at you

583
00:38:40,334 --> 00:38:42,934
for being scared.

584
00:38:42,936 --> 00:38:46,072
But I mean, the truth is

585
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:50,274
I was the one that was scared.

586
00:38:50,276 --> 00:38:52,909
I've been afraid of the man in yellow

587
00:38:52,911 --> 00:38:56,912
for my whole life.

588
00:38:56,914 --> 00:38:59,582
That's why I lost.

589
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:03,825
When you first moved in with us,

590
00:39:03,827 --> 00:39:06,563
I thought it was gonna be too much.

591
00:39:06,565 --> 00:39:10,567
I'm already a single dad.
Finances were tough.

592
00:39:10,569 --> 00:39:12,736
And you were a little boy
who just lost his mother.

593
00:39:12,738 --> 00:39:16,206
But, man, was I wrong.

594
00:39:16,208 --> 00:39:18,143
Within two weeks, you had
changed the whole dynamic

595
00:39:18,145 --> 00:39:19,745
of the house.

596
00:39:19,747 --> 00:39:22,717
Suddenly, the house was filled with this...

597
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:24,621
Light..

598
00:39:24,623 --> 00:39:26,258
This energy.

599
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:29,198
I mean, you brightened up everything.

600
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,869
You'd seen more darkness
than any man will in a lifetime,

601
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:36,474
and you never let it dim your soul.

602
00:39:36,476 --> 00:39:40,345
So there I was, thinking
that I'm changing your life

603
00:39:40,347 --> 00:39:43,250
by taking you in, but...

604
00:39:43,252 --> 00:39:45,386
The truth is...

605
00:39:47,422 --> 00:39:50,259
You changed mine.

606
00:39:50,261 --> 00:39:53,397
So don't lose that light now, Bar.

607
00:39:53,399 --> 00:39:56,600
The world may need The Flash, but...

608
00:40:00,705 --> 00:40:03,740
I need my Barry Allen.

609
00:40:11,285 --> 00:40:13,186
Let's go home.

610
00:40:13,188 --> 00:40:15,422
Yeah.

611
00:40:24,669 --> 00:40:26,136
- Hey.
- Oh.

612
00:40:26,138 --> 00:40:28,337
Hey. What are you guys doing here?

613
00:40:28,339 --> 00:40:31,608
I invited them.

614
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:33,179
Where's Dr. Wells?

615
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:35,580
Uh, he wasn't feeling up
to a social gathering,

616
00:40:35,582 --> 00:40:38,382
but he appreciated the invitation.

617
00:40:38,384 --> 00:40:42,255
- Eggnog?
- Yes.

618
00:40:42,257 --> 00:40:45,293
Merry Christmas, Barry.

619
00:40:45,295 --> 00:40:47,265
You too, Eddie.

620
00:40:47,267 --> 00:40:49,769
Hey, I, um...

621
00:40:52,107 --> 00:40:54,709
Well, I just wanted to say, um...

622
00:40:54,711 --> 00:40:56,944
I heard you're moving in together,

623
00:40:56,946 --> 00:41:00,981
and I'm really happy for you.

624
00:41:00,983 --> 00:41:03,717
Thanks.

625
00:41:05,185 --> 00:41:08,654
Merry Christmas.

626
00:41:10,123 --> 00:41:12,660
Mm. Day like today,

627
00:41:12,662 --> 00:41:17,328
grandma Esther's eggnog seems
a little light on the bourbon.

628
00:41:19,064 --> 00:41:21,699
- Hey, Joe.
- Hmm?

629
00:41:21,701 --> 00:41:24,835
- I saw something weird tonight.
- Yeah, Cisco, I saw it too.

630
00:41:24,837 --> 00:41:28,674
No, I mean, when The Flash
and the man in yellow

631
00:41:28,676 --> 00:41:30,907
were going full-on bumper cars
on each other,

632
00:41:30,909 --> 00:41:33,343
I was watching the electricity
coming off of them...

633
00:41:33,345 --> 00:41:35,579
yellow and red electricity.

634
00:41:35,581 --> 00:41:37,146
When Barry was a kid,

635
00:41:37,148 --> 00:41:39,347
he said he saw red and yellow
lightning in his house

636
00:41:39,349 --> 00:41:42,986
the night his mother died.

637
00:41:42,988 --> 00:41:45,321
There were two of them.

638
00:41:45,323 --> 00:41:47,989
The man in yellow
may have killed Barry's mother,

639
00:41:47,991 --> 00:41:49,823
but...

640
00:41:49,825 --> 00:41:53,793
There was another speedster
there that night.

641
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:56,968
Dad, it's time.

642
00:42:04,031 --> 00:42:06,171
Okay, let's see.

643
00:43:21,205 --> 00:43:23,869
Merry Christmas.

644
00:43:32,933 --> 00:43:36,834
