1
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,005
Despite appearances,
I think you'll find the city's on the rise.

2
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,202
Perhaps we should take shelter.

3
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,490
The city's on the rise?

4
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,682
Meereen is strong.

5
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,604
Commerce has returned to the markets.
The people are behind you.

6
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,002
Well, not all the people, of course.

7
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,447
No ruler that ever lived
had the support of all the people.

8
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,284
But the rebirth of Meereen
is the cause of this violence.

9
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,883
The Masters cannot let
Meereen succeed.

10
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,884
Because if Meereen succeeds,
a city without slavery,

11
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,771
a city without Masters...

12
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,762
It proves that no one needs a Master.

13
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,406
Good.

14
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,811
Shall we begin?

15
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,244
Do we have a plan?

16
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,288
I will crucify the Masters.

17
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,203
I will set their fleets afire,

18
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,001
kill every last one of their soldiers,
and return their cities to the dirt.

19
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,643
That is my plan.

20
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,730
You don't approve?

21
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,041
You once told me
you knew what your father was.

22
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,960
Did you know his plans for King's Landing
when the Lannister armies were at his gates?

23
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,326
Probably not.

24
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,887
Well, he told my brother,
and Jaime told me.

25
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,683
He had caches of wildfire
hidden under the Red Keep,

26
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,528
the Guildhalls, the Sept of Baelor,
all the major thoroughfares.

27
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,811
He would have burned
every one of his citizens.

28
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,211
The loyal ones and the traitors.

29
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,482
Every man, woman, and child.

30
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,721
That's why Jaime killed him.

31
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,285
This is entirely different.

32
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,485
You're talking about destroying cities.
It's not entirely different.

33
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,565
I'd like to suggest an alternate approach.

34
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,808
Once before, I offered you peace.

35
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,569
If you had not been so arrogant,

36
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,046
you could have returned to your homeland
with a fleet of ships.

37
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,643
Instead, you will flee
Slaver's Bay on foot,

38
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,930
like the beggar queen you are.

39
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:04,042
We are here to discuss terms of surrender,
not to trade insults.

40
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,082
The terms are simple.

41
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,965
You and your foreign friends
will abandon the Great Pyramid

42
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,525
and the city of Meereen.

43
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,285
The Unsullied you stole
from Kraznys mo Nakloz

44
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,442
will remain to be sold again
to the highest bidder.

45
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,011
The translator you stole
from Kraznys mo Nakloz

46
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,731
will remain to be sold again
to the highest bidder.

47
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,602
The dragons beneath the Great Pyramid
will be slaughtered.

48
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,402
We obviously didn't communicate
clearly.

49
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,970
We're here to discuss
your surrender, not mine.

50
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,604
I imagine it's difficult
adjusting to the new reality.

51
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,406
Your reign is over.

52
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,243
My reign has just begun.

53
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,326
Dracarys.

54
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,244
You men have a choice.

55
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:26,242
Fight and die for masters
who would never fight and die for you,

56
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,006
or go home to your families.

57
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,689
Thank you for the armada.
Our queen does love ships.

58
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,330
Now, last time we spoke,
we made a pact.

59
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,444
You violated that pact.

60
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,204
You declared war upon us.

61
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,567
Though our queen
does have a forgiving nature,

62
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,083
this cannot be forgiven.

63
00:09:55,160 --> 00:10:00,121
Our queen insists that one of you must die
as punishment for your crimes.

64
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,366
It always seems a bit abstract,
doesn't it?

65
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,646
Other people dying?

66
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,684
Him. He should die.

67
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,081
- Yes, him.
- He's not one of us.

68
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:16,721
He's an outsider, a lowborn.
He does not speak for us.

69
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,685
Please.

70
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,806
Please.

71
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,962
Tell your people what happened here.

72
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,251
Tell them you live by the
grace of Her Majesty.

73
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,242
When they come forward
with notions of retribution

74
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,688
or ideas about returning the slave cities
to their former glory,

75
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,048
remind them what happened

76
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,522
when Daenerys Stormborn
and her dragons came to Meereen.

77
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,444
You don't have to be here.

78
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,446
Yes, I do.

79
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,205
My beloved wife.

80
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,769
I've missed you terribly.

81
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:21,205
Thank you for returning
Lady Bolton safely.

82
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,366
Now, dismount and kneel
before me,

83
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,566
surrender your army

84
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,207
and proclaim me the true Lord of Winterfell
and Warden of the North.

85
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,328
I will pardon you
for deserting the Night's Watch.

86
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,802
I will pardon these treasonous lords
for betraying my house.

87
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,683
Come, bastard,

88
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,204
you don't have the men,
you don't have the horses,

89
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,203
and you don't have Winterfell.

90
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,963
Why lead those poor souls
into slaughter?

91
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,684
There's no need for a battle.

92
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,726
Get off your horse and kneel.

93
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,364
I'm a man of mercy.

94
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,205
You're right.

95
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,365
There's no need for a battle.

96
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,731
Thousands of men don't need to die.

97
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,205
Only one of us.

98
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,529
Let's end this the old way.

99
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,728
You against me.

100
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,244
I keep hearing stories about you,
bastard.

101
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,285
The way people in the North
talk about you,

102
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,567
you're the greatest swordsman
who ever walked.

103
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,610
Maybe you are that good.

104
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,721
Maybe not.

105
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,162
I don't know if I'd beat you.

106
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,289
But I know that my army
will beat yours.

107
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,481
I have 6,000 men.

108
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,769
You have, what, half that?

109
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,161
- Not even?
- Aye, you have the numbers.

110
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,767
Will your men want to fight for you
when they hear you wouldn't fight for them?

111
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,406
He's good. Very good.

112
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,643
Tell me, will you let your little brother
die because you're too proud to surrender?

113
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,444
How do we know you have him?

114
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,731
Now, if you want to save...

115
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,121
You're going to die tomorrow,
Lord Bolton.

116
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,485
Sleep well.

117
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,606
She's a fine woman, your sister.

118
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,761
I look forward to having
her back in my bed.

119
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,847
And you're all fine-looking men.

120
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,207
My dogs are desperate
to meet you.

121
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,130
I haven't fed them for seven days.
They're ravenous.

122
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,160
I wonder which parts they'll try first.

123
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,205
Your eyes?

124
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,086
Your balls?

125
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,009
We'll find out soon enough.

126
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,083
In the morning then, bastard.

127
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,400
If he was smart, he'd stay inside
the walls of Winterfell and wait us out.

128
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,490
That's not his way.
He knows the North is watching.

129
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,407
If the other houses
sense weakness on his part,

130
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,528
they'll stop fearing him.

131
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,001
He can't have that.
Fear is his power.

132
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,451
It's his weakness too.

133
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,921
His men don't want to fight for him.
They're forced to fight for him.

134
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,326
If they feel the tide turning...

135
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,641
It's not his men that worry me.

136
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,165
It's his horses.

137
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,720
I know what mounted knights
can do to us.

138
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,650
You and Stannis cut through us
like piss through snow.

139
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,168
We're digging trenches
all along our flanks.

140
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,288
They won't be able to hit us
the way that Stannis hit you,

141
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,600
in a double envelopment.

142
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,365
A pincer move.

143
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,922
They won't be able to
hit us from the sides.

144
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,766
Good.

145
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,410
It's crucial that we let them
charge at us.

146
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,126
They've got the numbers,
we need the patience.

147
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,164
If we let him buckle our
center, he'll pursue.

148
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,840
Then we'll have him surrounded
on three sides.

149
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:15,482
Did you really think
that cunt would fight you man-to-man?

150
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,681
No.

151
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,090
But I wanted to make him angry.

152
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,088
I want him coming at us full tilt.

153
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,730
We should all get some sleep.

154
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,604
Rest, Jon Snow.
We need you sharp tomorrow.

155
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,567
So, you've met the enemy,

156
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,483
drawn up your battle plans.

157
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,606
Aye, for what they're worth.

158
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:56,406
You've known him
for the space of a single conversation,

159
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,164
you and your trusted advisors,

160
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,643
and you sit around making your plans
on how to defeat a man you don't know.

161
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,405
I lived with him.

162
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:08,081
I know the way his mind works.
I know how he likes to hurt people.

163
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:13,530
Did it ever once occur to you
that I might have some insight?

164
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,245
You're right.

165
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,925
You think he's going to fall into your trap.
He won't. He's the one who lays traps.

166
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,004
- He's overconfident.
- He plays with people.

167
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,606
He's far better at it than you.
He's been doing it all his life.

168
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,809
Aye, and what have I been doing all
my life? Playing with broomsticks?

169
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:35,402
I fought beyond the Wall
against worse than Ramsay Bolton.

170
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,131
I've defended the Wall
from worse than Ramsay Bolton.

171
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,726
You don't know him.

172
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,605
All right, tell me.

173
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,886
What should we do?
How do we get Rickon back?

174
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,645
We'll never get him back.

175
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,164
Rickon is Ned Stark's trueborn son,

176
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:59,245
which makes him a greater threat to Ramsay
than you, a bastard, or me, a girl.

177
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,204
As long as he lives, Ramsay's claim
to Winterfell will be contested,

178
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,807
which means he won't live long.

179
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,289
We can't give up on our brother.

180
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,443
Listen to me, please.
He wants you to make a mistake.

181
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,521
Of course he does.

182
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,651
What should I do differently?

183
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,246
I don't know.
I don't know anything about battles.

184
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,209
Just don't do what he wants you to do.

185
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,691
Aye, that's good advice.

186
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,604
- You think that's obvious?
- Well, it is a bit obvious.

187
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,886
If you had asked for my advice earlier,

188
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,644
I would have told you not
to attack Winterfell

189
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,927
until we had a larger force,
or is that obvious too?

190
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,480
When will we have a larger force?

191
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,528
We've pleaded with every house
that'll have us.

192
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,888
The Blackfish can't help us.
We're lucky to have this many men.

193
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,442
- It's not enough.
- No, it's not enough. It's what we have.

194
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,648
Battles have been won
against greater odds.

195
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,609
If Ramsay wins,
I'm not going back there alive.

196
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,970
Do you understand me?

197
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:09,201
I won't ever let him touch you again.

198
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,562
I'll protect you, I promise.

199
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,763
No one can protect me.

200
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,089
No one can protect anyone.

201
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,009
You think there's hope?

202
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,766
I've never seen
these Bolton fuckers fight.

203
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,765
And they've never seen the free folk fight,
so, yes, there's hope.

204
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,124
You want to avenge your king,
don't you?

205
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,925
It wasn't the Boltons defeated Stannis.
It was Stannis himself.

206
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,922
I loved the man.
He lifted me up and made me something.

207
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,570
But he had demons in his skull
whispering foul things.

208
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,768
- You saw these demons?
- What?

209
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,847
No, it's a manner of speaking.

210
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,801
Not actual demons.

211
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:24,329
Well, you loved that cunt Stannis
and I loved the man he burned.

212
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,607
Mance didn't have demons in his skull.

213
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,929
He didn't torch people
or listen to some red witch.

214
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,611
I believed in him.

215
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:36,601
I thought he was the man
to lead us through the Long Night.

216
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,842
But I was wrong, just like you.

217
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,130
Maybe that was our mistake,
believing in kings.

218
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,969
Jon Snow's not a king.

219
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,611
No, he's not.

220
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,726
I need a good drink
to help me sleep the night before a fight.

221
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,370
You want some?

222
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,807
I have a jug of sour goat's milk

223
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,090
stronger than any of that grape water
you southern twats like sucking on.

224
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:11,086
No, thanks. It does sound delicious,
but I better keep a clear head.

225
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,088
I can never sleep the
night before a battle.

226
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,961
So what do you do all night?

227
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,080
I walk. Think and walk.

228
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,522
Think and walk
until I'm far enough away from camp

229
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,523
that no one can hear me
shitting my guts out.

230
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,285
Happy shitting.

231
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,921
My lady.

232
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,724
You weren't at the war council.

233
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,165
I'm not a soldier.

234
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,965
Any advice?

235
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,720
Don't lose.

236
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,082
If I do, if I fall...

237
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,330
Don't bring me back.

238
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,531
I'll have to try.

239
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,409
I'm ordering you not to bring me back.

240
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,005
I am not your servant, Jon Snow.

241
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,447
You're in my camp.
I'm the commander.

242
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,249
I serve the Lord of Light.

243
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,642
I do what he commands.

244
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,051
How do you know what he commands?

245
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,761
I interpret his signs

246
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,004
as well as I can.

247
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:40,566
If the Lord didn't want me to bring
you back, how did I bring you back?

248
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,684
I have no power.

249
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,730
Only what he gives me,
and he gave me you.

250
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,846
Why?

251
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,451
I don't know.

252
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:02,048
Maybe you're only needed for this small
part of his plan and nothing else.

253
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,647
Maybe he brought you here
to die again.

254
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:13,127
What kind of god
would do something like that?

255
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,245
The one we've got.

256
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,483
Last time we saw each other
was at Winterfell, yes?

257
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,729
You were making jokes about my height,
I seem to recall.

258
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,120
Everyone who makes a joke
about a dwarf's height

259
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:24,687
thinks he's the only person
ever to make a joke about a dwarf's height.

260
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,251
The height of nobility,
a man of your stature,

261
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,129
someone to look up to.

262
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,683
You're all making the
same five or six jokes.

263
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,161
- It was a long time ago.
- It was.

264
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,970
And how have things
been going for you since then?

265
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,364
Not so well, I gather.

266
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,128
Can't imagine you would have murdered the
Stark boys if things had been going well.

267
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,770
I didn't murder the Stark boys.

268
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,006
But I did things
that were just as bad or worse.

269
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,161
And he paid for them.

270
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,571
Doesn't seem like it.

271
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,361
He's still alive.

272
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,762
It was complicated for you, I'm sure,
growing up at Winterfell.

273
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,849
Never quite knowing who you were.

274
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,963
But then, we all live
complicated lives, don't we?

275
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:12,127
You've brought us 100 ships
from the Iron Fleet with men to sail them.

276
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:17,047
In return, I expect you want me to support
your claim to the throne of the Iron Islands?

277
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,963
Not my claim. Hers.

278
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,166
And what's wrong with you?

279
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,730
I'm not fit to rule.

280
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,529
We can agree upon that at least.

281
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,523
Has the Iron Islands
ever had a queen before?

282
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,690
No more than Westeros.

283
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,202
Our Uncle Euron returned home
after a long absence.

284
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:37,409
He murdered our father
and took the Salt Throne from Yara.

285
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,482
He would have murdered us
if we'd stayed.

286
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,646
Lord Tyrion tells me
your father was a terrible king.

287
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,768
You and I have that in common.

288
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:52,048
We do.
And both murdered by a usurper as well.

289
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,441
Will their ships be enough?

290
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,323
With the former Masters' fleet,
possibly.

291
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,447
Barely.

292
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,241
There are more than 100 ships
in the Iron Fleet.

293
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,687
There are, and Euron is building more.

294
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,410
He's going to offer them to you.

295
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,845
So why shouldn't I wait for him?

296
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,400
The Iron Fleet isn't all he's bringing.

297
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,685
He also wants to give you...

298
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,730
His big cock, I think he said.

299
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,930
Euron's offer is also
an offer of marriage, you see.

300
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,809
You won't get one without the other.

301
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,451
And I imagine your offer
is free of any marriage demands?

302
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,611
I never demand,
but I'm up for anything really.

303
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:33,569
He murdered our father
and would have murdered us.

304
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,881
He'll murder you
as soon as you have what he wants.

305
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,564
The Seven Kingdoms.

306
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,846
All of them.

307
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,809
And you don't want the Seven Kingdoms?

308
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,645
Your ancestors defeated ours
and took the Iron Islands.

309
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,564
We ask you to give them back.

310
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,086
And that's all?

311
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,731
We'd like you to help us
murder an uncle or two

312
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,609
who don't think a woman's fit to rule.

313
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,125
Reasonable.

314
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,241
What if everyone starts demanding
their independence?

315
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,322
She's not demanding, she's asking.

316
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,321
The others are free to ask as well.

317
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:11,130
Our fathers were evil men,
all of us here.

318
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,640
They left the world worse
than they found it.

319
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,920
We're not going to do that.

320
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,765
We're going to leave the world
better than we found it.

321
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,489
You will support my claim
as queen of the Seven Kingdoms

322
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:27,803
and respect the integrity
of the Seven Kingdoms.

323
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:32,285
No more reaving, roving,
raiding, or raping.

324
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,205
That's our way of life.

325
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,691
No more.

326
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,846
No more.

327
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,609
Do you like games, little man?

328
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,086
Let's play a game.

329
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,685
Run to your brother.

330
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,567
The sooner you make it to him,
the sooner you get to see him again.

331
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,524
That's it.

332
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,965
That's the game.

333
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,126
Easy.

334
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,281
Ready?

335
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,841
Go.

336
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,090
No, you have to run, remember?

337
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:06,169
Those are the rules.

338
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,160
Don't.

339
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,280
Prepare to charge.

340
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,686
Prepare to charge.

341
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,721
- Draw!
- Draw!

342
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,451
Draw!

343
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,607
Loose!

344
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,204
Go! Go! Follow your commander!

345
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,645
Run and fight!

346
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,206
Nock!

347
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,488
- Draw!
- Draw!

348
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,605
- Loose!
- Loose!

349
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,401
Now.

350
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:36,491
Cavalry, charge!

351
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,849
- Nock!
- Nock!

352
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,081
- Nock!
- Nock!

353
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,770
- Draw!
- Draw!

354
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,282
- Draw!
- Draw!

355
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,843
We'll just kill our own men.
Stand down.

356
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,765
- Loose!
- Loose!

357
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,040
Get word...

358
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,645
No.

359
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,687
Loose!

360
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,205
- Loose!
- Loose!

361
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,249
- Loose!
- Loose!

362
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,408
We may as well be taking
shits back here.

363
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,604
Follow!

364
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,245
It's time, go.

365
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:24,131
- Who owns the North?
- We do!

366
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,006
- Who owns the North?
- We do!

367
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,320
Show me!

368
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,730
Hey!

369
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:59,767
Infantry, advance!

370
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,686
With me, lads! Break their line!

371
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:10,641
Help me!

372
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,010
- Tormund!
- Get him back!

373
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:43,845
Infantry, advance.

374
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:50,446
Both sides!

375
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,284
Fall back!

376
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,604
Fall back!

377
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,008
Fuck this, come on!

378
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,525
We're going home!

379
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:49,089
Open the gate!

380
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,562
Archers to the wall.

381
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:01,042
- Their army's gone.
- Our army's gone.

382
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:03,401
We have Winterfell.

383
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:06,966
They don't have the men for a siege.
All we have to do is wait.

384
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,646
Archers! To the wall!

385
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,407
You suggested one-on-one combat,
didn't you?

386
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:57,291
I've reconsidered.

387
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,845
I think that sounds like
a wonderful idea.

388
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:05,161
We're going to bury my brother
in the crypt next to my father.

389
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:13,401
Jon.

390
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:21,006
Where is he?

391
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:52,406
Sansa.

392
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:58,209
Hello, Sansa.

393
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,447
Is this where I'll be staying now?

394
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,206
No.

395
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,288
Our time together is
about to come to an end.

396
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,611
That's all right.

397
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,684
You can't kill me.

398
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:37,169
I'm part of you now.

399
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:42,727
Your words will disappear.

400
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:47,881
Your house will disappear.

401
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,287
Your name will disappear.

402
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:55,521
All memory of you will disappear.

403
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:25,607
My hounds will never harm me.

404
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:29,647
You haven't fed them in seven days.
You said it yourself.

405
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,570
They're loyal beasts.

406
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:36,880
They were.

407
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:39,444
Now they're starving.

408
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:04,681
Sit.

409
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:06,767
Down.

410
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:08,806
Down!

411
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,370
Down! Down!

412
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:14,481
Down!
