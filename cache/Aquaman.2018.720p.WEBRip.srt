<b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>It gave us the ability

431
00:47:18,409 --> 00:47:21,410
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And so, we evolved.</i></font></b>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Others regressed,
became savage.</i></font></b>

433

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">And the king lived out the remainder
