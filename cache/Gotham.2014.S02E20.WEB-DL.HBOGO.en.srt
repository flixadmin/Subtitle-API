1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,720
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:04,800
I'll find my way out.

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,520
Because this place
is just one big puzzle,

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,000
and puzzles are my forte.

5
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:09,960
Oh, my.

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,600
I don't know who you are anymore.

7
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,080
Please, that is such
a ridiculous cliche...

8
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,560
It's time for me
to look out for number one.

9
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,360
The man who contracted Matches
Malone to kill your parents

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,840
called himself "The Philosopher."

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,360
"Hugo Strange, The Philosopher."

12
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,040
I was one of the ones
who forced Thomas Wayne

13
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,240
to shut down the program.

14
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,320
You're lying.

15
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,680
I needed to be sure
you were behind all this,

16
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,760
and now I am.

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,840
Our creations need new personas
to give their minds focus.

18
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,120
That sword was made yesterday.

19
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,840
Our replica is central to his
acceptance of his new identity.

20
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,400
I'm Azrael!

21
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,440
My Lord Dumas.

22
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,280
Command me.

23
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,880
A murderer walks the streets
of this city a free man.

24
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,000
By your blade, he must be destroyed.

25
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,160
- Tell me his name.
- James Gordon.

26
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,600
That is not possible.

27
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:12,960
You?

28
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,120
You're dead.

29
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,120
Not anymore.

30
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,440
Five-O, Five-O, come on, come on!

31
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,040
What is the meaning of this?

32
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,080
You are upsetting the inmates.

33
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,160
Where's your boss, darling?

34
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,720
We got a warrant to search his office
and everything in it.

35
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,720
He's busy with patients.

36
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,840
That's quite all right, Ms. Peabody.

37
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,560
We're gonna tear this place apart,
Strange.

38
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,880
We're gonna get answers.

39
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,520
Answers to what?

40
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,760
Records indicate Theo Galavan's
dead body was brought here,

41
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,200
that it was cremated.

42
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,440
Seems likely.

43
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,080
Then why the hell was he
at the GCPD last night,

44
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,120
running our captain through
with a sword, huh?

45
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,640
I'm surprised as you are.

46
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,320
And while you're at it,
explain to me this:

47
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,480
why Victor Fries,
also last seen here, very dead,

48
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,880
is alive and kicking
and dressed like a spaceman.

49
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,760
You stink, Strange.

50
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,440
This whole damned place stinks.

51
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,840
Excuse me.

52
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,200
Is this your office?

53
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,640
Yes, but, Detective, please...

54
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,120
What the...?

55
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,320
Shredded?

56
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,480
Son of a...

57
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,560
Spring cleaning.

58
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,080
You're free to look around.

59
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,960
I'm just not sure
there's much more to see.

60
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,200
You think shredding a few
documents is gonna save you?

61
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,280
It won't.

62
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,680
We're onto you.

63
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,440
Bad guys come in
and monsters come out.

64
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,360
Just like Pinewood, right?

65
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,280
Seeing as how you no longer work
for the police department,

66
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,560
I'm not required to speak with you,

67
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,040
Mr. Gordon.

68
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,720
You have a lot of anger,
James Gordon.

69
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,000
I can help you with that.

70
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,560
We're gonna tear
this damn building apart,

71
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,840
every square inch!

72
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,240
Check your warrant, Detective.

73
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,560
It clearly states that you have
permission to search my office,

74
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,960
nothing more.

75
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,000
Of course, I'm more than happy
to accommodate you

76
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,040
if you come back
with a different warrant.

77
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,200
Just know that I will also
be calling the judge

78
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,440
and telling him how disruptive it is
to have the GCPD, and others,

79
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,920
traipsing about this place of healing

80
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,720
and disrupting the patients
unnecessarily.

81
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,400
This ain't over yet.

82
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,440
Has Azrael returned?

83
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,520
Nope.

84
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,560
Troubling.

85
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,600
Hey. Hey!

86
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,800
What are you doing out of your cell?

87
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,320
Big mistake. Sorry, my bad.
Just got lost.

88
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,760
Escort me back, would you?

89
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,280
Thank you.

90
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,320
Thank you, have a nice day.

91
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,240
I've gotta get out of here.

92
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,040
Damn kids.

93
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,520
Did you break the lock?

94
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,480
Hey, you!

95
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,640
This is God's house,
a place of worship,

96
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,840
not a homeless shelter.

97
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,880
Get out before I call the cops.

98
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,560
I need a weapon
to fulfill my holy quest.

99
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,400
I don't have any weapons.

100
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,080
Then what good are you?

101
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,760
{\an5}<i>Captain Nathaniel Barnes remains
in critical condition</i>

102
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,760
{\an5}<i>at Gotham General
after suffering a violent attack</i>

103
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,480
<i>by a masked assailant
late last night.</i>

104
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,480
<i>So far, no arrests have been made,</i>

105
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,400
{\an5}<i>but reports coming from within
the locked-down GCPD have confirmed</i>

106
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:42,840
{\an5}<i>that the masked man is, in fact,
former Gotham mayor Theo Galavan.</i>

107
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,360
{\an5}<i>Search parties continued
throughout the night,</i>

108
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,920
{\an5}<i>but, as of yet, Galavan's whereabouts
remain a mystery.</i>

109
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,280
{\an5}There's nowhere to hide, Galavan.

110
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,280
{\an5}I'm coming for you.

111
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,960
Alvarez, any sign of him yet?

112
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,640
No, but we've got six choppers
in the air

113
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,480
{\an5}and every sniffer dog in the state
out there looking.

114
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,760
{\an5}Call the brass upstate,
tell them to get more men down here.

115
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,360
{\an5}That freak couldn't have gotten far.

116
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,000
Tom, get Judge Bam Bam on the phone.

117
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,720
{\an5}Tell him I need a new warrant
to search Arkham,

118
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,760
every frigging room, all of it!

119
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,720
{\an5}What are they all doing?

120
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,240
They don't have a captain, Harvey.

121
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,080
{\an5}Guess you're it.

122
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,040
I ain't no captain.

123
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,600
{\an5}Say something to them.

124
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,520
{\an5}I don't work here anymore, you do.

125
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,920
All right, everyone, listen up.

126
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,600
I know we're all a bit freaked out
right now.

127
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,760
{\an5}It's understandable, hmm?

128
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,320
{\an5}Some nutjob
in a Halloween costume and cape

129
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,880
{\an5}comes into our house
and takes out four of our brothers?

130
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,400
{\an5}He does this to our captain?

131
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,760
{\an5}Now, I've been around a long time.

132
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,960
It's like the bad guys in this town

133
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,680
{\an5}just keep getting weirder
and weirder.

134
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,480
{\an5}But under that mask...

135
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,120
{\an5}is just a man,

136
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,560
{\an5}and he can bleed,
just like you and me.

137
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,320
{\an5}And if he bleeds, he can be beaten.

138
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,720
{\an5}So, let's do what the cap
would tell us to do if he were here.

139
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,960
{\an5}Let's go out there
and let's find that son of a bitch

140
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,520
{\an5}and let's get him, whatever it takes!

141
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,600
All right.

142
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,920
I'm not one for speeches.

143
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,560
- No, no, no, you did fine.
- But?

144
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,400
If that was Galavan that I saw,
he'll know how to stay out of sight.

145
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,360
We gotta think outside the box.

146
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,480
Like what?

147
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,480
Who knows him best
who's still in the city?

148
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,920
His sister.

149
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,640
Alfred, pull over.

150
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,600
Master Bruce, are you out
of your tiny, bloody mind?

151
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,000
There's a madman loose
on the streets.

152
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,560
Now is not the time to go
running around on your own, is it?

153
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,320
I don't plan on being on my own.

154
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,400
With all due respect, sir,

155
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,720
what good will a 15-year-old
little girl do

156
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,080
even if Galavan does turn up?

157
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,720
Strange lied to the police.

158
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,480
I know it, and so do you.

159
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,960
I can't stay at home and do nothing.

160
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,240
We need to trust Jim Gordon.

161
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,080
I'm tired of trusting Jim Gordon,
aren't you?

162
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:43,240
I am your guardian, Master Bruce,
and it is my job to protect you.

163
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,160
Is it your job to watch me
sit on my hands and do nothing?

164
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,920
Alfred, please.

165
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,240
Let me go.

166
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,960
Hey, buddy, move your car!

167
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,480
Just, just be careful, all right?

168
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,480
I will.

169
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,840
Hey, let's go!

170
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,600
Yeah, all right, mate, keep,
just keep your bloody hair on!

171
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,480
Don't go, baby, come on,
let's talk about this, huh?

172
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,080
Is this because
I... I kicked Barbara out?

173
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,680
Just let me go, Butch.

174
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,960
Come on, I'll do whatever you want.

175
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,160
I... I... I'll eat more fruit.

176
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,160
I... I'll work on the snoring,
I swear to God, whatever you need...

177
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,640
Catch you guys at a bad time?

178
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,880
Seriously, how do people
keep getting in here?

179
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,440
Do I have no security at all?

180
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,560
Why the rush?

181
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,560
Just time to move on.

182
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,640
Oh, yeah, is that it?

183
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,040
Or are you worried Galavan
is coming after you, too?

184
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,480
Don't worry, Butch.

185
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,120
It's not about you.

186
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,680
She's just scared of her brother.

187
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,600
Come on, help me find him.

188
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,840
You two hardly left
on the best of terms.

189
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,600
Must have been weird,
see your dead brother

190
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,400
show up dressed like a ninja
from Medieval times.

191
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,200
That thing that stabbed
your captain last night...

192
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,000
wasn't my brother.

193
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,080
It was a 300-year-old assassin
called Azrael.

194
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,680
Azrael?

195
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,280
That image I saw on the news,
his clothes, the way he moved,

196
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,440
it was Azrael.

197
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,400
A mythical figure worshiped
by the monks who raised my brother.

198
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,640
A cold-hearted killing machine
sent into the night

199
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,480
to kill his master's enemies.

200
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,760
And he wants you.

201
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,960
An ancient assassin?

202
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,640
A legend.

203
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,320
My family used to tell stories
of him.

204
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,080
He was real?

205
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,520
Who knows?

206
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,000
It was 300 years ago.

207
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,240
Probably, yes.

208
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,120
So, your brother's gone nuts?

209
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,360
You tell me.

210
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,120
Theo convince you
that he was Azrael last night,

211
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,200
or was he acting?

212
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,720
Someone got inside my brother's head.

213
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,000
It's not a safe place to be.

214
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,240
If you're right,
I wanna find this person,

215
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,960
but first I have to find
your brother.

216
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,280
So help me.

217
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,680
If a search team finds him,
they're gonna kill him.

218
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,360
He is still your brother, after all.

219
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,280
He's blood.

220
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:14,240
The sword that was used last night,
the one that broke, it was fake.

221
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,440
And you know this how?

222
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,480
The real one
belonged to my grandfather.

223
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,880
He was an antiquities collector,
obsessed with Dumas history.

224
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,440
I saw it once. It was beautiful.

225
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,080
Forged by the monks themselves.

226
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,480
It's said to hold
supernatural powers.

227
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,320
Theo knew this.

228
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,080
It's possible he'll attempt
to steal it back.

229
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,960
Does your grandfather still have it?

230
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,120
And where is he?

231
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,720
Gotham Cemetery.

232
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,240
He's been dead for 20 years.

233
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,920
But he was buried with his treasures.

234
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Selina?

235
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,680
What's up?

236
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:14,120
I remember you telling me you're
still feeding your friend's birds.

237
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,920
Someone has to.

238
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,960
Why you here?

239
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,760
- Have you seen the news?
- Walking zombies in Gotham?

240
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,480
What's new?

241
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,560
Strange worked for my father
on a project designed to help people.

242
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,440
He perverted it and now
I believe he's found a way to...

243
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,600
Bring back the dead?

244
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,120
A little far-fetched,
don't you think?

245
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,040
Perhaps, but he's hiding something.

246
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,520
The police failed to find out what.

247
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,800
I think I can do better.

248
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,520
That so?

249
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,840
When my father shut down Strange,
he was killed.

250
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,160
Selina, I just want the truth,
that's all.

251
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,920
You just won't be happy until
you get yourself killed, will you?

252
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,840
Victor Fries and Theo Galavan
both went to Arkham as dead men.

253
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,160
- Both returned.
- I don't care.

254
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,480
So did your friend Bridgit.

255
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,960
Wait, they sent her to Arkham?

256
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,200
She may still be there right now.

257
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,960
Alive.

258
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:20,600
I told her to leave town, to run,
but she didn't listen.

259
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,320
It's my fault she's there.

260
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,760
Selina, we can put this right.

261
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,520
Strange was ready for the police.

262
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,280
He may even have been tipped off.

263
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,880
The only way we're gonna find out
what's really going on in there...

264
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,640
is if we break in ourselves.

265
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,480
Break-in?

266
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,760
To Arkham?

267
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,600
A highly guarded place
that's packed with crazy people?

268
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,360
If it's too dangerous for you,
I'll just go myself.

269
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,360
I didn't say that.

270
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,560
Prisons are meant to stop people
from breaking out, not in.

271
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,640
It can be done.

272
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,680
It's a loony bin, not a prison.

273
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,640
I know it can be done.

274
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
But I go alone.

275
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,800
Why?

276
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,080
If I get caught,
they'll just toss me out.

277
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,960
Nobody cares about me.

278
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,520
But you? They see you coming

279
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,800
and they'll shut
that whole thing down

280
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,320
quicker than you can say "Rat."

281
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,080
And then you'll never find out
what they've been up to.

282
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,200
That, or they'll just kill you.

283
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,160
Besides...

284
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,960
I already know a way in.

285
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,880
This is it.

286
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,720
The Dumas crypt.

287
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,360
Dozens of my relatives
are buried here.

288
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,880
So does someone have a key?

289
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,920
All right. Key, crowbar.

290
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,080
This one. My grandfather's.

291
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,040
Wait, wait, wait.
I'm sure we're breaking

292
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,160
more than a few laws right now.

293
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,360
Really?
This is where you draw the line?

294
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,800
Come on.

295
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,680
This doesn't creep you out,
even a little bit?

296
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,280
It's frigging grave robbing!

297
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,000
"Whatever it takes," Harvey.

298
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,360
Little help?

299
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,360
That was said to be Azrael's sword
up until the end.

300
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,360
He died?

301
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,880
No, he disappeared.

302
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,320
Azrael's thought to be immortal.

303
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,400
It's beautiful.

304
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,200
I will take that.

305
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,440
James Gordon.

306
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,280
Time...

307
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,720
to...

308
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,160
die!

309
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,920
Step aside. He must die.

310
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
It's me, brother.

311
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,400
Don't you recognize me?

312
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,040
My quarrel is not with you.
Step aside.

313
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,640
Tabitha.

314
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,840
Your sister.

315
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,000
I have what you're looking for.

316
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,080
Tabitha?

317
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,240
That's right.

318
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,560
You remember where we grew up?

319
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,240
The estate by the sea?

320
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,560
Before the monks took you.

321
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,960
Our dogs, the horses?

322
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,440
We were happy once.

323
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,960
You are Theo Galavan.

324
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,680
My brother.

325
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,080
Theo?

326
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Yes.

327
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,640
Theo Galavan, the new mayor.

328
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,320
Do you remember now?

329
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,600
Death to the Son of Gotham.

330
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,480
Death to the Son of Gotham.

331
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,800
Bruce Wayne.

332
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,880
We were sent to kill him.

333
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,040
Yes, yes, but...

334
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,320
He dishonored our family name.

335
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,840
- Yes.
- Death to the Son of Gotham.

336
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,120
Thank you for reminding me.

337
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,080
Traitor.

338
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,040
Go through the folding iron.

339
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,400
There you go.

340
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,560
There you go.

341
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,480
Come on, let's go.

342
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,200
- Harvey?
- He's gone!

343
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,200
This is Bullock.

344
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,800
I need a backup down at the cemetery.

345
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,680
Galavan's in the wind again.

346
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,600
Okay.

347
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,720
I'm sorry.

348
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,000
I made him remember.

349
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,120
Remember what?

350
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,280
Bruce.

351
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,080
"Death to the Son of Gotham."

352
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,880
Stay with her. I need to find Bruce.

353
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,880
Hey!

354
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,640
Stop!

355
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,960
- I need this car.
- You ain't a cop anymore, Gordon.

356
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,360
I need the damn car!

357
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,720
Yeah, it's, it's okay.

358
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,040
What do we got here?

359
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,440
Looks good.

360
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,400
Put it with the other one.

361
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,280
All right, this looks good.

362
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,600
Come on, come on.

363
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,080
Master Bruce?

364
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,000
<i>No, it's me. Where's Bruce?</i>

365
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,360
I don't know. He was in the city.

366
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,440
Where in the city?

367
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,480
Well, to be perfectly honest,
I haven't got the foggiest.

368
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,480
He's got a mind of his own
at the moment, that one, innit he?

369
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,000
All right, well, we need to find him.

370
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,960
Galavan could be coming after him.

371
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,760
Well, you're having a laugh, ain't
you? I thought he was after you.

372
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,960
He was. Tabitha must have jogged
his memory.

373
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:51,720
Reminded him of his original mission:
kill Bruce Wayne.

374
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,080
Right. Well, I'll,
I'll get the motor.

375
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,800
No, no, no. You stay there
in case he comes back.

376
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,200
Where was the last place
you saw him in the city?

377
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,680
Collins and Delaney.

378
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,240
Last I saw of him,
he was headed for the roof

379
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,080
to see that Selina, I reckon.

380
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,720
<i>All right, I'll head over there.</i>

381
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,080
<i>Till then, be safe.</i>

382
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,520
Right-o. Will do.

383
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,080
Oh, for Pete's sake, Master Bruce.

384
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,680
Creeping up on someone like that,
I could have filleted you.

385
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,760
Sorry.

386
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,560
- What's wrong?
- Galavan, Master Bruce.

387
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,480
Theo bloody Galavan is what's wrong.

388
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,360
Okay. Okay.

389
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,520
Holy cow!

390
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,560
Forensic guy?

391
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,920
- Street trash girl?
- You framed Gordon.

392
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,600
And you tried to get a reward
by turning him in.

393
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,680
Oh, yeah.

394
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,920
What the hell are you doing here?

395
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,360
What the hell are you doing here?

396
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,000
I gotta get out of here.
This place is crazy.

397
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,520
They're probably looking for me.
Which way is out of here?

398
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,120
I'll help you if you help me.

399
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,200
Where's Strange right now?

400
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,840
Okay.

401
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,880
Look, I barely know you.

402
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,400
but that is the last person
that you wanna be looking for.

403
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,560
Why is that?

404
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,640
The basement here,

405
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,640
it's horrible.

406
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,720
Just trust me, stay away.

407
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,720
- He's a very dangerous man.
- Basement?

408
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,480
Alive people.

409
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,960
Dead people.

410
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,240
- Dead-alive people. It's horrible.
- Okay, how do I get there?

411
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,600
Wow, it's like I'm saying things,
and you're just not hearing them.

412
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,160
He has a friend of mine,
and I'm here to get her out.

413
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:45,120
Now, how do I get there?

414
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,280
- You'll tell me the way out?
- Yes.

415
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,440
Okay. There's an elevator.

416
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,960
I'll tell you where it is, but...

417
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,320
can you pick a lock?

418
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,760
Why'd you have to be brave, huh?

419
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,200
I just got used to you being around.

420
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,000
Partners, right?

421
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,600
How am I supposed to keep people
in line now, huh?

422
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,560
I don't think I can do this
without you.

423
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,840
You're one of the only people
in the world

424
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,080
who looks me in the eye
when they talk to me.

425
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,800
You know that?

426
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,800
You laugh at my jokes.

427
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,800
You actually like the way I look.

428
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,000
I didn't think I'd ever feel
like this again.

429
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,840
I guess what I'm trying to say is...

430
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,400
Well, don't stop now.
I was just getting misty.

431
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,440
What are you doing here?

432
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,120
Paying my respects.

433
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,520
She's looked better, I must say.

434
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,440
You will not hurt her.

435
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,920
Why would I do that?

436
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,640
I know.

437
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:44,120
Because she stabbed my mother
in the back!

438
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,480
If you touch her, I will kill you.

439
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,200
I like this new side of you.

440
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,080
Soft, sentimental.

441
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,560
He has to pay, Butch.

442
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,480
Who?

443
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,880
- Azrael?
- No! Galavan!

444
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,880
See, I will not buy
this whole uber-villain nonsense.

445
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,920
I mean, if he wanted to wear leather,
he should just wear leather.

446
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,560
This is Gotham City.
No one cares, right?

447
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,640
We have all suffered by his hand.

448
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:27,680
Me, you, my mother.

449
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,760
And now his own sister.

450
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,800
Galavan must die.

451
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,520
And when he does,
you'll leave us alone?

452
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,720
I suppose.

453
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,640
Promise.

454
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,080
Jeez. Fine. Yes. Whatever.

455
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,120
Where is he?

456
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,680
Yeah.

457
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,360
He's here, and he's safe.

458
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,360
Thank God. I'm coming.

459
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,480
You're more to me
than just a guardian, Alfred.

460
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,640
You're my friend.

461
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,000
Your timing really
is quite impeccable, Master Bruce.

462
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:40,160
But we haven't got time
for sentimental nonsense right now.

463
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,600
We have to make sure
that all the doors are locked,

464
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,240
all the windows are closed,
and the lights are off

465
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,520
to make it as hard as possible
for Galavan to find us,

466
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,600
do you get me?

467
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,120
Detective Gordon sure
he's coming here?

468
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,120
Nothing's certain, is it?

469
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,480
So we need to be ready.

470
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,920
Okay.

471
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,800
It's a big house. We should split up.

472
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,160
Fine.

473
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,120
But just you be quick.

474
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,480
<i>So, you take the upstairs.</i>

475
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,160
<i>I will take the downstairs.</i>

476
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,800
<i>You make sure the windows are closed.</i>

477
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,160
<i>You make sure the doors are locked.</i>

478
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,080
<i>You make sure the skylights
are closed.</i>

479
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,040
<i>And then you meet me down here
as quick as you can in the study.</i>

480
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,280
<i>All right? Now go.</i>

481
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,720
Alfred! Alfred!

482
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,480
Ingenious.

483
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,440
You,

484
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,000
you will show me to the boy.

485
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,360
Over my dead body.

486
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,120
As you wish.

487
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,040
Check it out.

488
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,040
What's that noise?

489
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,160
Hey, Ed. What's that noise?

490
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,080
Nygma!

491
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,320
Son of a...

492
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,800
Nygma.

493
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,880
Sound the alarm. We got a runner!

494
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,200
Go!

495
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,600
Come on, come on, come on.

496
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,440
Okay, great.

497
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,200
Okay.

498
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,880
Alfred! Alfred!

499
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,320
Alfred!

500
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,040
Take one more step, mate,

501
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,360
I will put a bullet
right between your bloody eyes.

502
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,320
You think that will stop me,
manservant?

503
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,120
I'd like to give it a go,
if you don't mind.

504
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,560
Think I am flesh and blood?

505
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,640
I am immortal
and I have grown tired of you!

506
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,040
Alfred!

507
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,680
Run, Bruce!

508
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,320
Immortal? Let's see, shall we?

509
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,320
Alfred!

510
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,800
Come on, come on.

511
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,160
Someone to come down here
and take a look.

512
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,000
Give us a minute, please.

513
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:49,680
I think we can safely say
Azrael has gone rogue.

514
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,800
I'm not comfortable
making that assumption just yet.

515
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,760
But it's been more than 24 hours
since he's made contact.

516
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,120
Perhaps that's because
Jim Gordon still breathes.

517
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,880
But if the police catch him first,
how do we explain...

518
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,960
Something that cannot be explained?

519
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,400
We don't.

520
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,680
Theo Galavan is no more.

521
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,800
Azrael is his new creation.

522
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:12,080
A killer, a madman.

523
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,320
The GCPD will fail
if they try to capture him.

524
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,760
They'll have to kill him first.

525
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,040
And when they do,

526
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,720
they'll be successfully covering
our tracks for us.

527
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,120
In the meantime,
this facility needs to be shut down.

528
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,000
All subjects moved
to the new location.

529
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,280
Already happening.

530
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,320
That's my girl.

531
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,720
Damn it.

532
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,320
Don't hide, little boy.

533
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,680
Face me.

534
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,600
Face death.

535
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,960
You know the Waynes were a blight
upon this city.

536
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:55,200
A selfish, arrogant family.

537
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,240
A family with no beliefs.

538
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,320
No honor.

539
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,360
No respect.

540
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,680
You're your father's only son, Bruce.

541
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:18,360
When I kill you,
I eradicate the Wayne name...

542
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,760
forever.

543
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:32,520
It will be as though
you had never existed.

544
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,880
Enough fun and games.

545
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,840
Prepare to die.

546
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,280
Unexpected.

547
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,400
You okay?

548
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,720
Sorry I couldn't get here sooner.

549
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,480
Seems like I missed all the fun.

550
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,560
Where have you been?

551
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,400
I slowed him down for you, didn't I?

552
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,920
I'll call Bullock.

553
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,560
Time I taught you how to drive,
Master Bruce.

554
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,160
You should know by now

555
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,480
that bullets don't kill this monster,
Jim.

556
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,120
My last one got stuck in your throat,

557
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,840
so I'm thinking about shoving
this one somewhere else.

558
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,000
Jim, a little tip for next time:

559
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,600
always bring the right tools
for the job.

560
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,520
See you in hell, Theo.

561
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,360
You're welcome.

562
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,480
Let's go, Butch.

563
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:24,960
Night, fellas.

564
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,120
Oh, my God.

565
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,120
That little sprite was right.

566
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,840
Freeze.

567
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,640
Remain where you are.

568
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,440
Oh, dear.

569
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,640
Are you my human subject?

570
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:51,880
What?

571
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,840
Were you sent here to test me?

572
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,840
Bridgit?

573
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,000
Who's Bridgit?

574
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,720
- It's me, Selina.
- What?

575
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,960
You burnt yourself when the cops
tried to bust you, remember?

576
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,520
I don't remember anything
before this.

577
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,320
Professor Strange told me
I had amnesia.

578
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,760
No, don't trust him.

579
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,840
Your name is Bridgit.

580
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:17,520
He told me he'd send people
to test me.

581
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,560
Well, I'm not here to test you.
I'm here to take you home.

582
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,800
That's what he said you'd say.

583
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,960
Bridgit, no. Bridgit, no.

584
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,480
Bridgit, no. Bridgit, no.
Bridgit, no!

585
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,200
Bridgit, no.

586
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,720
Don't call me that.

587
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:36,800
My name's Firefly.
