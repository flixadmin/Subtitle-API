[Rafiki laughs]
I'll tell you a secret.

128
00:07:26,467 --> 00:07:28,844
When your father Simba
was your age,

129
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:30,846
he was afraid of the thunder

130
00:07:30,929 --> 00:07:32,848
and would hide behind the king.

131
00:07:33,014 --> 00:07:34,224
When did he stop hiding?

132
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:36,476
One day, during a big storm,

133
00:07:36,643 --> 00:07:39,395
your grandfather Mufasa
took your father

134
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:41,773
to the very top of Pride Rock,

135
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,441
told him to stand with him

136
00:07:43,608 --> 00:07:45,485
and howl into the wind.

137
00:07:45,651 --> 00:07:48,446
And Simba slowly stepped out
with the king.

138
00:07:48,613 --> 00:07:51,950
And together,
they roared into the night.

But I'm not brave like my dad.

00:07:56,329 --> 00:07:58,289
And I could never be
like Mufasa.

142
00:07:58,373 --> 00:08:01,084
[Rafiki chuckling] Is that so?

143
00:08:02,001 --> 00:08:04,795
Then maybe it's time
I tell you a story.

144
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:08,090
A story of a cub,
not much bigger than you.

145
00:08:08,383 --> 00:08:11,761
A lion born without a drop
of nobility in his blood.

A lion who would change
our lives forever.

On the other side of the light.

In this place, everything
was dying of thirst

Well, next to last. [chuckles]

Between Albert the Iguana and I,

His Majesty decided
on the underling with wings.

957
00:49:41,073 --> 00:49:43,867
And thus, I became the
lead scout for the princess.

It's my third day,

Sarabi, you can say so as well.

[Mufasa] How far do you think
you'll get with a bird?

How far do you two geniuses

I don't know that <i>Milele</i>
exists, but right now,

it's the only hope we have.

We don't need hope.
We need food.

He makes a valid point,
Your Highness.

980
00:50:29,787 --> 00:50:31,623
But, on the other hand,
he's a starving lion,

981
00:50:31,706 --> 00:50:33,582
he wants to eat me,

Tonight, a cheetah

for the third night in a row.

Almost took one of our own.

It was Rafiki's fault.

He summoned the beast
with his dreams.

[baboon 1] Rafiki

Rafiki tried to warn you.

His dreams conjure our enemies.

He talks to the spirits,
summons the devil.

[baboon 2] He's done it before.

1000
00:51:25,633 --> 00:51:27,593
His brother was chased
from these very trees,

Rafiki was just a child.

A child born with a leg that
does not work.

Yet somehow, he survived?

It was Rafiki who found water
in the dry season.

Who healed you, Inaki,

My eyes are open.
It is my lids that are closed.

Why am I talking to a baboon?

I am not a baboon.
I am a mandrill.

1120
00:56:56,833 --> 00:56:59,543
No offense,
but a monkey is a monkey.

1121
00:56:59,710 --> 00:57:01,129
[Rafiki] And a stray is a stray.

1122

What's that supposed to mean?

1123

It means

Take a good look. I am a lion.

[Rafiki] A lion who fears water,

You are afraid

Afraid of what you see in them.

1134

[Mufasa] I see my parents.

1135

[Rafiki] Of course
you do, Mufasa.

You will feel them forever.

1138

My mother, I hear her voice.

1139

She tells me that we are
on a journey to <i>Milele,</i>

1140
00:57:43,378 --> 00:57:46,548
but I feel so lost without her.

00:57:46,714 --> 00:57:50,177
Your journey
is not a dream, Mufasa.

1142
00:57:50,343 --> 00:57:52,137
Your mother is guiding you,

Around or down?

1159

The decision is yours.

1160
00:58:49,735 --> 00:58:50,902
Mmm.

1161
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:53,822
Look out there,
beyond the light.

1162

Why? Because of some
fairy tale? [scoffs]

It's safer to go around.
