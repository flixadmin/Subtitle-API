164
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:40,923
Careful.

165
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:55,103
All the best swords have names, you know.

166
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:00,359
Sansa can keep her sewing needles.

167
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:04,071
l've got a needle of my own.

168
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:20,921
l came to say goodbye to Bran.

169
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:22,631
You've said it.

170
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:36,353
l wish l could be here when you wake up.

171
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:42,192
l'm going north with Uncle Benjen.

172
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:43,652
l'm taking the black.

173
00:15:52,661 --> 00:15:55,414
l know we always talked about
seeing the Wall together,

174
00:15:55,497 --> 00:15:59,209
but you'll be able to come visit me
at Castle Black when you're better.

175
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:03,797
l'll know my way around by then.

176
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:06,258
l'll be a sworn brother of the Night's Watch.

177
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:14,349
We can go out walking beyond the Wall,
if you're not afraid.

178
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:31,909
l want you...

179
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:33,702
to leave.

180
00:17:33,262 --> 00:17:34,972
1T years ago

181
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:37,516
you rode off with Robert Baratheon.

182
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:43,063
You came back a year later
with another woman's son.

183
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:47,317
And now you're leaving again.

184
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:51,697
l have no choice.

185
00:17:51,864 --> 00:17:55,742
That's what men always say
when honour calls.

186
00:17:55,826 --> 00:17:59,204
That's what you tell your families,
tell yourselves.

187
00:18:00,998 --> 00:18:03,166
You do have a choice.

188
00:18:04,418 --> 00:18:05,878
And you've made it.

189
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:11,967
Cat...

190
00:18:17,014 --> 00:18:19,516
l can't do it, Ned.

191
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:24,438
l really can't.

192
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:26,023
You can.

193
00:18:28,567 --> 00:18:29,735
You must.

194
00:18:53,425 --> 00:18:56,053
You've said goodbye to Bran?

195
00:18:56,178 --> 00:18:58,180
He's not going to die. l know it.

196
00:18:58,305 --> 00:19:00,474
You Starks are hard to kill.

197
00:19:01,517 --> 00:19:03,018
My mother?

198
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:05,687
- She was very kind.
- Good.

199
00:19:07,523 --> 00:19:09,650
Next time l see you,
you'll be all in black.

200
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:11,902
lt was always my colour.

201
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:14,863
Farewell, Snow.

202
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:16,615
And you, Stark.

203
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,170
There's great honour serving
in the Night's Watch.

204
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:16,800
The Starks have manned the Wall
for thousands of years.

205
00:20:17,843 --> 00:20:19,720
And you are a Stark.

206
00:20:19,845 --> 00:20:21,930
You might not have my name,

207
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:24,057
but you have my blood.

208
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:32,691
ls my mother alive?

209
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,987
Does she know about me?
Where l am, where l'm going?

210
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:39,698
Does she care?

211
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:43,994
I
The next time we see each other

212
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:46,121
we'll talk about your mother.

213
00:20:46,288 --> 00:20:48,040
Hmm?

214
00:20:48,123 --> 00:20:49,625
l promise.

215

[Horse neighs]

216
00:21:29,373 --> 00:21:32,209
Gods, this is country!

217
00:21:34,253 --> 00:21:37,464
l've half a mind to leave them
all behind and keep going.

218
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:41,969
l've half a mind to go with you.

219
00:21:42,052 --> 00:21:46,765
What do you say, just you and me
on the Kingsroad, swords at our sides,

220
00:21:46,932 --> 00:21:50,227
a couple of tavern wenches
to warm our beds tonight.

221
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:53,021
- You should have asked me 20 years ago.
- [Chuckles]

222
00:21:53,105 --> 00:21:55,899
There were wars to fight,
women to marry -

223
00:21:55,983 --> 00:21:58,277
we never had the chance to be young.

224
00:21:58,402 --> 00:22:00,028
l recall a few chances.

225
00:22:00,112 --> 00:22:02,322
[Laughing]

226
00:22:03,949 --> 00:22:06,535
There was that one...
Oh, what was her name?

227
00:22:06,618 --> 00:22:08,579
That common girl of yours?

228
00:22:08,662 --> 00:22:11,498
Becca. With the great big tits
you could bury your face in.

229
00:22:11,582 --> 00:22:13,792
Bessie.
She was one of yours.

230
00:22:13,917 --> 00:22:17,588
Bessie!
Thank the gods for Bessie.

231
00:22:17,754 --> 00:22:19,339
And her tits.

232
00:22:20,382 --> 00:22:22,801
Yours was, er... Aleena?

233
00:22:22,926 --> 00:22:25,804
No. You told me once. Er... Meryl?

234
00:22:25,888 --> 00:22:27,848
Your bastard's mother?

235
00:22:29,683 --> 00:22:31,852
- Wylla.
- That's it.

236
00:22:31,935 --> 00:22:34,021
She must have been a rare wench

237
00:22:34,188 --> 00:22:37,065
to make Lord Eddard Stark
forget his honour.

238
00:22:37,149 --> 00:22:39,234
You never told me what she looked like.

239
00:22:40,277 --> 00:22:41,528
Nor will l.

240
00:22:44,114 --> 00:22:46,033
We were at war.

241
00:22:46,158 --> 00:22:48,911
None of us knew if we were
gonna go back home again.

242
00:22:49,077 --> 00:22:52,080
You're too hard on yourself.
You always have been.

243
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:57,252
l swear if l weren't your king,
you'd have hit me already.

244
00:22:57,377 --> 00:23:00,714
The worst thing about your coronation -

245
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:02,841
l'll never get to hit you again.

246
00:23:05,177 --> 00:23:07,638
Trust me, that's not the worst thing.

247
00:23:11,683 --> 00:23:13,644
There was a rider in the night.

248
00:23:19,775 --> 00:23:23,237
Daenerys Targaryen has wed
some Dothraki horselord.

249
00:23:23,362 --> 00:23:25,197
What of it? Do we send her
a wedding gift?

250
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,616
A knife perhaps, a good, sharp one,

251
00:23:27,699 --> 00:23:29,743
and a bold man to wield it.

252
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:31,662
She's little more than a child.

253
00:23:31,787 --> 00:23:34,998
Soon enough that child will spread her legs
and start breeding.

254
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:38,794
- Tell me we're not speaking of this.
- Oh, it's unspeakable to you?

255
00:23:38,877 --> 00:23:42,214
What her father did to your family -
that was unspeakable.

256
00:23:42,297 --> 00:23:44,633
What Rhaegar Targaryen
did to your sister -

257
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:46,760
the woman l loved.

258
00:23:46,885 --> 00:23:49,930
l'll kill every Targaryen l get my hands on.

259
00:23:50,013 --> 00:23:51,974
But you can't get your hands
on this one, can you?

260
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,726
This Khal Drogo,

261
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:56,728
it's said he has 100,OOO men
in his horde.

262
00:23:56,854 --> 00:23:59,606
Even a million Dothraki
are no threat to the realm,

263
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:02,317
as long as they remain on the other side
of the Narrow Sea.

264
00:24:02,401 --> 00:24:04,403
They have no ships, Robert.

265
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:07,489
There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms
who call me usurper.

266
00:24:08,615 --> 00:24:12,327
lf the Targaryen boy crosses
with a Dothraki horde at his back,

267
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:15,080
- the scum will join him.
- He will not cross.

268
00:24:16,665 --> 00:24:19,960
And if by chance he does,
we'll throw him back into the sea.

269
00:24:25,007 --> 00:24:27,050
There's a war coming, Ned.

270
00:24:28,135 --> 00:24:31,305
l don't know when,
l don't know who we'll be fighting,

271
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:32,890
but it's coming.

Ah, rapers.

280
00:25:59,893 --> 00:26:03,689
They were given a choice, no doubt -
castration or the Wall.

281
00:26:03,772 --> 00:26:06,066
Most choose the knife.

282
00:26:11,113 --> 00:26:13,615
Not impressed by your new brothers?

283
00:26:16,577 --> 00:26:18,328
Lovely thing about the Watch -

284
00:26:18,412 --> 00:26:21,790
you discard your old family
and get a whole new one.

285
00:26:30,841 --> 00:26:32,676
Why do you read so much?

286
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:35,929
Look at me and tell me what you see.

Ieft me out in the woods to die.

Alas, l was born a Lannister
of Casterly Rock.

291
00:26:50,652 --> 00:26:52,613
Things are expected of me.

292
00:26:52,738 --> 00:26:55,157
My father was the Hand of the King
for 20 years.

293
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,284
Until your brother killed that king.

294
00:27:03,248 --> 00:27:06,835
Yes, until my brother killed him.

295
00:27:08,921 --> 00:27:11,381
Life is full of these little ironies.

296
00:27:12,424 --> 00:27:15,177
My sister married the new king, and...

297
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:17,763
my repulsive nephew
will be king after him.

298
00:27:20,432 --> 00:27:23,602
l must do my part for the honour of my house.
Wouldn't you agree?

00:27:25,395 --> 00:27:27,314
But how?

300
00:27:27,439 --> 00:27:30,234
Well, my brother has his sword

301
00:27:30,317 --> 00:27:31,610
and l have my mind,

302
00:27:31,735 --> 00:27:35,781
and a mind needs books
like a sword needs a whetstone.

303

That's why l read so much, Jon Snow.

305
00:27:44,581 --> 00:27:46,750
What's your story, bastard?

306
00:27:49,044 --> 00:27:51,922
Ask me nicely
and maybe l'll tell you, dwarf.

307

A bastard boy with nothing to inherit,

off to join the ancient order

Ah, yes, yes, against
grumpkins and snarks

312
00:28:12,526 --> 00:28:16,071
and all the other monsters
your wet nurse warned you about.

You're a smart boy.

the accounts, my lady.

You'll want to know how much
this royal visit has cost us.

320
00:29:15,464 --> 00:29:17,508
Talk to Poole about it.

with Lord Stark, my lady.
