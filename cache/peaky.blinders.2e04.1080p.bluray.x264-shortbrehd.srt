1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,686
A vacancy has appeared
and you're going to fill it.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,924
From now on, Mr Shelby,
you shut your gypsy mouth

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,923
and listen to your instructions.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,767
<i>I know it was you who carried
out the murder of Mr Duggan.</i>

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,642
--You are on my hook, Mr Shelby.

6
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,806
- Name?
-Harold Hancox.

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,008
- Have you ever been arrested?
-No.

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,923
Arthur, we can stand him up.

9
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,250
<i>Last night, one of our men had
his throat cut in Winston Green.</i>

10
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,845
I'm not real!

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,970
Gentlemen? This is your cousin.
Polly's son, Michael.

12
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,520
- I want to go with them.
-Over my dead body.

13
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,921
Do we hear 800 guineas? 850.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,731
<i>May Carleton.
I breed racehorses and train them.</i>

15
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,485
- So will you consider me?
-I will consider you.

16
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,330
Thomas Shelby?

17
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,524
<i>Did they behave themselves?</i>

18
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,167
They were really amazing.

19
00:00:59,800 --> 00:02:09,787
<b><font color="#004F8C">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

20
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,207
You might think this is a curious
place for me to suggest a meeting,

21
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,808
but...

22
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,486
your surprises have only just begun.

23
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,690
You look a little unsteady, Mr Shelby.

24
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,050
Take a seat.

25
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,760
You're working together.

26
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,011
Blowing up the Garrison was your idea.

27
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,004
You chose me.

28
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,003
It's funny, I thought the
Fenians had a policy...

29
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,809
- Enough.
-Eh? Of not mixing

30
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,086
the personal with the political.

31
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,366
- I said enough.
-I think

32
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,010
I will decide on what is enough.

33
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,651
Who's in charge here then, eh?
Who's in charge?

34
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,241
Right, let me understand this.

35
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,085
- You answer to an agent of the Crown.
- Perhaps we can just...

36
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,050
- Very interesting.
-Perhaps we can stick to the agenda.

37
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,566
- Whose agenda?
-There is a form of words here.

38
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,529
- Whose words?
-Arrogant bastard.

39
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,963
I'm not accustomed
to being spoken to like that.

40
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,206
just come to order.

41
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,567
I am here to listen,
but not to the fucking infantry.

42
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,881
Enough! Jesus!

43
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,405
Now...

44
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,161
Some weeks ago, Mr Shelby
carried out a military mission

45
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:15,131
on behalf of pro-treaty Republicans
here in Birmingham.

46
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,440
You...

47
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,329
Working for the King.

48
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,722
- There is a unique political situation.
-Yea h? How does that feel?

49
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,328
- Let us...
-Tell me. How does that fucking feel?

50
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,686
...stick to the form of words.

51
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,081
- Temporarily, we have a shared interest.
-Oh, I see.

52
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,322
- Shall we just stop him laughing?
-You want me to stop laughing?

53
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,891
Explain this, pal.

54
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,208
Following the success of your mission...

55
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,766
- We're going to make you do it again.
-Will you shut up?

56
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,207
Can we just conduct
ourselves here, please?

57
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,805
- Conduct ourselves!
-Please.

58
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,521
No one in this room wants to breathe
the same air as anyone else.

59
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,965
- Nevertheless...
-Nevertheless the pro-treaty Paddies

60
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,088
and the King want the same man dead.

61
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,450
Am I right?

62
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,610
- Why him?
-Did you ask why in France?

63
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:26,889
- Yeah.
-So, it's the same answer, because.

64
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,251
Why me?

65
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,521
- Because.
-Because.

66
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,289
Because if anybody connects me to this,

67
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,846
it will be assumed
that it was a criminal act

68
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,769
and not a political one.

69
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,447
No, you need not fear being
connected to the killing

70
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,888
because I will see to it that
no connection is ever made.

71
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,364
You will have complete
immunity after the fact.

72
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,766
But, in the execution, you will get
no help from agents of the Crown.

73
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,565
And we can't be seen to be involved.

74
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,730
You have been chosen, Mr Shelby,

75
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,810
and there really is no choice.

76
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,367
No equals bang,

77
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,205
and your man here will shed no tears
as he looks the other way.

78
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,730
Nevertheless...

79
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,806
I say no.

80
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,607
Mr Shelby?

81
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,209
What about your export licence,
Mr Shelby?

82
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,726
You had a deal with Mr Churchill.

83
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,244
The one with the mouth,
Donal Henry, he is a spy.

84
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,211
He is working for the Irregulars
against the pro-treaty Paddies.

85
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,527
He reports every fucking
word back to them.

86
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,806
No, it's not possible.

87
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,645
They've both been security vetted
by my own department.

88
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,087
I have men in places your men can't go.

89
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,044
Donal Henry meets the
anti-treaty Paddies in the back room

90
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,528
of the Mother Red Cap in Saltley,
sometimes twice a week.

91
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,451
These Irish enemies are
fucking brothers and cousins.

92
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,364
You are stepping into a world
you don't understand.

93
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,846
If what you're saying is true,
he'll be dealt with.

94
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:32,482
Bring me proof the spy is dead
and we have a deal.

95
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,601
Mr Shelby.

96
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,404
- Billy boy.
-Watch it.

97
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,169
Now on you go.

98
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,724
Right. boys, let's go!

99
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,163
Fuck you!

100
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,083
Mario!

101
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,169
Mario!

102
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,687
Mario!

103
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,489
Come here.

104
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,206
Sabini's day is done.

105
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,564
I'll protect you now.

106
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,724
Oh, shut up!

107
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,361
Stop fucking whingeing.

108
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,408
Due to my razor blade,

109
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,563
and a few complaints from the neighbours

110
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,450
about the terrible fucking music...

111
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,729
Do you want to tell them or should I?

112
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,361
This place is under new management.

113
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,089
<i>By order of the Peaky Blinders.</i>

114
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,045
Yes?

115
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,970
Somebody to see you, Mr Shelby.

116
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,883
He says he's come about the
position of accounts clerk.

117
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,644
Send him in.

118
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,491
- just through here, sir.
- Thank you.

119
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,965
Michael...

120
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,764
Vacancy's been filled.

121
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,642
Not according to this morning's paper.

122
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,122
At school, I was top of the
class in mathematics,

123
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,210
and I did a night school course in
accountancy at Worcester College.

124
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,564
Mum says you've had
six different accountant clerks

125
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,971
in the last six months.

126
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:20,000
When respectable men see the
other things you do, they leave.

127
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,207
But I, like Lizzie out there,
already know what you do.

128
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,208
Mum says you want to be 80% legal
within two years.

129
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,521
- Three.
-I can help.

130
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,767
I know both sides and
you know you can trust me.

131
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:44,449
I want to help you, Tommy, become legal.

132
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,289
Do the right thing.

133
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,810
I want to be proud of this family.

134
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,130
Does Polly know you're here, Michael?

135
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,204
I'm 18 on Friday, I go where I please.

136
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,404
You phone your mother.

137
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,004
Good luck.

138
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,127
We're not open for winnings yet.

139
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,129
I'm here to see Thomas Shelby.

140
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,248
I have an appointment.

141
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,970
Come in.

142
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,520
- May Carleton.
- Mr Shelby has his proper meetings

143
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,568
in his other office.

144
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,850
This was the address that he gave me.

145
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,605
- He gave you this address?
-He said it was a gambling den.

146
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,564
I told him that I'd wanted to see one

147
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,369
since I'm always reading
about them in the papers.

148
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,844
Quite the big scandal
in The Telegraph lately.

149
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,890
Anyway, he said that
I could come and have a look.

150
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,371
And now I feel like a bit of an idiot

151
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,568
because I'm early and he's late
and I have no idea how to behave.

152
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,525
In a gambling den?

153
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,526
I'll wait in the car.

154
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,080
If I open the door again,
they'll all want to come in.

155
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,204
Like flies.

156
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,006
So what are you?

157
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,809
What am I?

158
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,370
To Thomas?

159
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,447
I'm going to train his racehorse...
For Epsom.

160
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,005
You know horses?

161
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,891
Yes. You?

162
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,246
Born riding.

163
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,405
I slept in a manger when I was a baby.

164
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,889
I was born riding, too.

165
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,291
There's a fucking
great Riley parked out there

166
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,646
and nobody's watching it.

167
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,805
John, this woman says
she's training Thomas' horse.

168
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,969
He's told us a lot about you.

169
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,650
Don't know where he is, do you?

170
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,166
Sorry I'm late.
There was a family matter.

171
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,049
Esme, keep it locked up for a minute.

172
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,766
- Yes, Thomas.
-I'll show you around.

173
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,929
So, be my guest.

174
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,202
That's my brother Arthur's office.

175
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,728
Down there is my brother John's office,

176
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,406
that's where we slate
the runners and the riders.

177
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,370
It's so out in the open.
What about the police?

178
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,170
What about them?

179
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,443
When I drove into Small Heath,
I thought I was going to get murdered...

180
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,682
Then I mentioned your name.

181
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,328
It was like being escorted
to see a king.

182
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,365
- You came here to get my girl, right?
-Right.

183
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,530
She looks in very good condition,

184
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,921
considering she's not been
out on the gallops.

185
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,009
Curly's the best horseman in England.

186
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,651
I have a man called Mickey
who'd argue the point.

187
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,200
Ah, Curly here is half horse himself.

188
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,442
She's blessed. Very blessed.

189
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,409
Well, she's from the best stock.

190
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,922
But I'd rather have a coloured pony.
Mixed blood is stronger.

191
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,210
Not to win the Derby, Curly.

192
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,328
Don't like them racing, Tommy,
not the way they beat them.

193
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,531
- She's all yours.
-Thank you.

194
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,849
He gets sad when one leaves.

195
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:38,848
- What time is your box van coming?
-Midday.

196
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,810
Maybe you've got time to take
the lady to the Garrison,

197
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,689
show her the spa and the tearooms.

198
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,003
I'd like that, why not?

199
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:58,047
I just had it done up.
There was a fire.

200
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,645
It's...

201
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,166
Yeah.

202
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,730
What do you drink?

203
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,724
So early, but gin.

204
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,130
Goodness. With something?

205
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,524
Like what?

206
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,485
Tonic water or...

207
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,568
Erm... We have, erm...

208
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,006
Cordial.

209
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,085
There's not much room in there but...

210
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,403
You want to fuck me, Mrs Carleton?

211
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,889
Perhaps because I...

212
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,085
Perhaps because I would represent
something to you?

213
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,487
We should have this conversation
before the booze

214
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,010
starts talking for us.

215
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,571
You have a horse.

216
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,609
Yes, I have a horse.

217
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,720
The horse is why I'm here.

218
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,405
Purely that.

219
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,209
And because you're paying me a
lot of money to train your horse,

220
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,770
that's why I'm here.

221
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,646
Purely that.

222
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,284
Good.

223
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,163
Good. Well, a toast, then.

224
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,849
To the horse, to the Derby.

225
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,809
- Cheers.
-Cheers.

226
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,042
So is that what you say to women?

227
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,924
Only if I don't know what they want.

228
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,768
And what if they don't want to fuck?

229
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,322
Then life is simpler.

230
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,970
You want a simple life?

231
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,765
Do I look like a man
who wants a simple life, eh?

232
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,565
So what do you want?

233
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,731
For what I'm paying you, Mrs Carleton,

234
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,845
I want a horse that'll pay out
at Epsom on an each-way bet.

235
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,690
Before I took your account,

236
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,645
I did some credit checks on you.

237
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,365
Apparently, you don't exist.

238
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,842
My existence is questionable.

239
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,443
Gypsies don't like registers.

240
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:00,725
You see, I'm not gypsy like you mean.

241
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,723
But you did register for France.

242
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,682
I also sent your name to the War Office,

243
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,521
I have friends there.

244
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,841
You won two medals for gallantry.

245
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,329
Does that really impress you,
Mrs Carleton?

246
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,205
Call me May.

247
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,123
Charlie says the box Van's here.

248
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,890
Thank you, Finn.

249
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,208
You know, I still don't know what
you're going to call your horse.

250
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,283
The horse will be called Grace's Secret.

251
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,564
Grace's Secret.

252
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,610
I told him he definitely
can't take the job.

253
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,766
He said, "All right,
I'll move to London, then."

254
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,686
I said, "I won't give in to blackmail.
No is no."

255
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:12,403
Well... That settles it, then.

256
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,285
I'll give the job
to the other candidate.

257
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,328
He's much better qualified anyway.

258
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,166
Michael did City and Guilds, six months.

259
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,402
Yeah, but he doesn't know racing, Poll.

260
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,409
He knows horses,
but he doesn't know racing.

261
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,962
This other boy, he knows racing.

262
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,929
He's good. He's a fast learner.

263
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,362
What if Michael really leaves?

264
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,882
You just got to let him go, Poll.

265
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,611
He'll get a job in an office in London.

266
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,170
I'm sure he'll write to you.

267
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,730
He made a big speech

268
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:53,169
about wanting to help you
build up a respectable business.

269
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,004
Oh, he's like his dad,
he could make me cry.

270
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,050
There are trains to London.

271
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,890
So I just let him leave?

272
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,289
Every month or so he'd be back.

273
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,523
Unless, of course, he meets a girl.

274
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,723
Then, who knows?

275
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,889
Oh, my God.

276
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,010
You want him to do this job.

277
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,084
Polly, I want what you want.

278
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:26,162
What about this other more
qualified candidate?

279
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,008
Mmm...

280
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,684
Well, I lied, there isn't one.

281
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,244
How much you paying?

282
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,888
- The advertised rate.
-Like hell.

283
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,648
- Three bob.
-Like hell.

284
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,449
- Three and six.
-Four.

285
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,365
Four it is.

286
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,889
- I love him, Tom.
-I know.

287
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,649
That's why I'll keep him away
from the old business,

288
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,121
put him charge of the new. Agreed?

289
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,850
Agreed.

290
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,925
Well, Finn, you've got two choices,
mild or mild.

291
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,080
- Mild.
-There you go.

292
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,686
--Here he is, look.

293
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,404
Happy birthday, Michael.

294
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,410
Eighteen years old. You're a man today.

295
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,766
Give him a drink, John boy.

296
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,166
- There you go, lad.
-And after that,

297
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,682
we'll go to find you
a lady of the night.

298
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,966
Arthur!

299
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,768
Michael.

300
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,444
What's that?

301
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,728
So you're never late for work.

302
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,407
Welcome to the business,
Michael.

303
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,723
- Welcome to the business.
-Thank you.

304
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,882
Right, come on, let's get him drunk.
Come here, you.

305
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,166
All right, whisky.

306
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,325
No whisky, he's at work tomorrow.
Give him only dark mild.

307
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,447
A toast.

308
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,290
- Toast.
- To Michael.

309
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,964
To Michael.

310
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,850
You all right?

311
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,886
- What is it?just us?
-just us.

312
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,291
We celebrating?

313
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,211
just taste this.

314
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,771
What do you think, Arthur?

315
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,401
Yeah, it's good.
Good stuff, really nice.

316
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,403
Too good for the Garrison.

317
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:10,848
I suppose we could shift it
to the toffs at the Eden Club.

318
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,005
Why? What is it?

319
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,284
That is part of an export drive.

320
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,770
We now have a secure warehouse
in Camden Town

321
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,764
and secure passage to the Poplar Docks.

322
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,683
So, on Monday morning,

323
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,525
we'll be sending out
our first export crates.

324
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,241
A crate of Riley car spa res,

325
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,408
bound for Halifax, Nova Scotia.

326
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,810
Where there's prohibition.

327
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,890
Where there is prohibition.

328
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,009
All over Canada and America,

329
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,044
people are making their own booze
in bathtubs.

330
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:50,371
But rich people in New York,
in Toronto and Boston

331
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,603
are still paying a lot of
money for the real stuff.

332
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,962
So, on Monday,
the first Shelby company crates

333
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:00,169
will contain a thousand
Riley carburettors.

334
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:04,845
But hidden in the packing
will be 500 bottles

335
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:09,130
of the finest quality
single malt Scotch whisky.

336
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,329
And we Shelbys, have a licence

337
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,482
granted by the
Minister Of The Empire himself,

338
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,771
which means our crates
won't be searched.

339
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,810
And, Polly, all of the whisky
will be packed at the docks,

340
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,202
so Michael can do the books
without being involved.

341
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,371
Like I've been telling
you all for a year now,

342
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,764
motor cars are the future.

343
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,611
So, how is your life then, Tom?

344
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,331
On the up, Johnny, on the up.

345
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,882
But, Tom, really, come on, how is it?

346
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,043
You know I hate to
see you not even married yet.

347
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,681
I have a fine looking cousin,
she'll make your life hell.

348
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,000
You deserve her!

349
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,484
We haven't had a good old
wedding in a long time.

350
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,963
Rather look inside these boxes,
then, Johnny?

351
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,609
What do I want to look
at car parts, Tommy,

352
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,125
when I haven't even got a car?

353
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,042
Faith in family's a fine thing, eh?

354
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,208
And I wouldn't even be counting.

355
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,924
Twenty-five becomes 24, then 24 it is.

356
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,844
Oh, you know I'm no good
with numbers, Tom.

357
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,929
And if 24 ever became 23,

358
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,684
then that'd be tax.

359
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,125
We don't pay tax.

360
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,445
No, Tom.

361
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,725
Good man.

362
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,123
I put an iron door on,

363
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,090
and we've put iron bars on the
windows and across the skylights.

364
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,491
Good.

365
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,050
So what will you
be keeping in here, Tommy?

366
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,686
Temptation, Billy. Temptation.

367
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,762
Morning, Arthur. I was just passing.

368
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,203
I think I'm in fucking love.

369
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,560
Drink!

370
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,770
She don't know where to look.

371
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,526
Whisky, Tommy?

372
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,404
No, I've got a long drive ahead.

373
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,925
You off home?

374
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,364
Mmm-hmm. Eventually.

375
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,091
To Birmingham.

376
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,006
What's this?

377
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,326
Olives.

378
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,004
Yes, it's miscellaneous.

379
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,241
It's, erm, olives.

380
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,525
Sticks, you know, with little bits
of fucking onion and things.

381
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,011
That's what that is.

382
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,202
We've taken 600 pounds on olives.

383
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,129
Yeah, with little bits of onion.

384
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,450
I told you, Arthur...

385
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,801
The dealers sell the cocaine,
we take a cut.

386
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,008
We don't sell direct.

387
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,090
The Home Secretary's cracking down

388
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,009
and I don't want this,

389
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,686
to fuck up everything else,
you understand?

390
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,928
I understand.

391
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,521
How much of that 600
came out of your pocket?

392
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,890
It's under control.

393
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,766
I put you down here cos people
are scared of you, Arthur.

394
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:02,001
But if you don't straighten up,
it'll be John's turn in London.

395
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,282
No need.

396
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,691
I can handle it.

397
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,725
It's under control?

398
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,331
It's under control.

399
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,249
Fucking tidy profit, though, eh?

400
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,650
It's happening, Tom.

401
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,926
Good.

402
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,081
Good.

403
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,130
Straighten up, soldier.

404
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,768
Yes, sir, Sergeant Major.

405
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,246
What's your business?

406
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,087
Sorry, I'm, er, I'm lost here.

407
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,005
Yeah, well, you can't stop here.

408
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,884
- Move on.
-All right.

409
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,529
Twenty-three seconds.

410
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,251
It's all right, Ada,
it'll be Andrew for me.

411
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,331
Oh.

412
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,124
I'm looking for Ada.

413
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,565
Who are you?

414
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,684
Ada.

415
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,444
I asked you a question.

416
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,249
It's all right, James.

417
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,561
This is my brother.

418
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:25,960
Who's he?

419
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,371
He rents a room.

420
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,204
You need to rent out rooms?

421
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,089
Actually, she doesn't charge rent.

422
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,642
He's a writer, which means he's skint.

423
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,130
You get up late these days, Ada.

424
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,929
Mmm. I go to bed late.

425
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,525
Yeah? Where's Karl?

426
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,570
What do you want, Tommy?

427
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:48,689
Oh, God, before you start
sizing him up for a wedding suit,

428
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,410
he's not interested in me.

429
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,767
- Or in girls of any kind.
-Ada!

430
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,285
What? Tommy won’t judge you.

431
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,090
He sure as hell won't go to the police.

432
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,168
Look, I'll go and get dressed.

433
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,924
James...

434
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,684
I'm Thomas.

435
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,446
Pleased to meet you.

436
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,401
Can I have a minute
with my sister, please?

437
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,411
Yes, of course.

438
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,286
So, does your lodger know your name?

439
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,044
Yeah. Thorne.

440
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,403
You think I'd tell anybody
anything else?

441
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:33,243
Your Brummie boys
are all over the papers.

442
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,448
Just one last push, eh?
Then you'll go legit?

443
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:39,282
Just one more obstacle to get round,
then it'll all be straight?

444
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,891
Actually, yes.

445
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,482
Personally, I find it quite amusing.

446
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,200
Men like you are becoming
very fashionable down here.

447
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,929
No society party in London
is complete without a gangster

448
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,730
for the girls to go giddy for.

449
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,681
Anyway, what is it that you want?

450
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,609
I don't have any children, Ada,

451
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,891
so I have set up a trust fund.

452
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,683
The beneficiaries
will be John's kids and Karl.

453
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:15,966
In order for Karl to benefit,
I need your signature.

454
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:22,442
I've set up an account.

455
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:26,650
The money will be transferred
in the event of my death.

456
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,007
It'll set them up for a new life.

457
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,004
Are you sick?

458
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,765
I'm just doing
what any ordinary man would,

459
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,330
putting my affairs in order.

460
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,687
<i>Did you know they was
going to take the Eden club?</i>

461
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:19,491
I know about the Eden club, yes.

462
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,608
Did you know they were going
to do it before they did it?

463
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,411
Because that's someone
who's in charge, isn't it?

464
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,082
The one who knows before it happens.

465
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,648
I know what I know, you know.

466
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:33,930
If you don't know,
then you don't fucking know, do you?

467
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,451
Did you know they was going
to take Wimbledon Docks?

468
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,481
Harringay? The trotting tracks?

469
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:47,163
Talk, all right?
I genuinely want to hear you.

470
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,571
You've lost control, Alfie.

471
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,971
Have I?

472
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,485
Everybody knows.

473
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,727
- Talk to me, Alfie.
-Talk to you?

474
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,484
All right, I'll talk to you.
I'll fucking tell you how it was, right?

475
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,528
What happened was this.

476
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,120
All the time you were talking about
dirty fucking Jews.

477
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,440
All the fucking time,

478
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,847
dirty fucking Jews, dirty Kikes,
dirty dustbin lids...

479
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,365
- Everyone makes jokes.
-You want to talk about

480
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,683
-not getting into places?
-Everybody makes fucking jokes.

481
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19,127
I didn't know you had
no sense of humour!

482
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,648
And I ain't going
to fucking mention, right,

483
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:27,044
the great big fuck off elephant
in the room.

484
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,931
Look, Alfie...

485
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,721
How many of my bookies
worked Epsom this last May?

486
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,529
None. None.

487
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,410
Not one.

488
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:41,326
So, for a few fucking jokes and Epsom,

489
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,882
you fucking invite
a tribe of savages into the city

490
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,930
and just fucking
unlock the fucking gates!

491
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,008
I'm sorry, what are you saying, mate?

492
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,085
I'm saying...

493
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,960
I'm sorry about the Jew thing.

494
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,561
- You saying you're sorry?
-Yeah.

495
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,361
- You're sorry about the Jew thing?
-Yeah.

496
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,844
- Really?
-Yea h.

497
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,450
I want that in writing.
Write that down. He said, "I'm sorry".

498
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,489
And also write down

499
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,326
that all our bookies
can go back to Epsom.

500
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,084
- He didn't say that.
-Who's asking you?

501
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,161
Eh.

502
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,324
Write it down.

503
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,767
It's all right. Come on.

504
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,330
Alfie's an old friend.

505
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,290
My friend.

506
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,250
Now, admit it,

507
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,368
the Peaky Blinders is out of control.

508
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,762
Yeah, they're out
of fucking control, mate.

509
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:47,162
They come down the canal,
they spread like the fucking clap.

510
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,411
Right. So now they're

511
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,090
-everybody's problem.
-Yeah.

512
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,444
- Alfie.
-Mmm.

513
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,728
You and me, we've been fighting

514
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,484
-since we was at school.
-Yeah.

515
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,768
All right? Now, also,

516
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,883
-we've been friends.
-Mmm, yeah.

517
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,886
You know,
it goes backwards and forwards.

518
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,490
How much better is it
when we're friends?

519
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,565
Oh, it's much better, mate, yeah.

520
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,251
You write that down.

521
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,841
Mmm.

522
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,171
So what we're doing here, right,

523
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:18,881
is we're writing down some
kind of a deal thing, right?

524
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,566
- Yeah, a written deal.
-Written deal, good.

525
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:26,841
Well, why don't we discuss
the border between the Italians

526
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,968
and the Jews going back
to Farringdon Road.

527
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,530
- Farringdon Road...
-Yeah, Farringdon Road.

528
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,523
Fuck! That's ancient history.

529
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,451
- Write down Farringdon Road.
-No, no, no, write down Camden Road.

530
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,204
- Farringdon Road.
-Camden Road.

531
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,361
- Write down Farringdon.
-Camden.

532
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,566
- Farringdon.
-Camden.

533
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,404
Write down Camden Road.

534
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,324
Just write down "peace".

535
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,448
Just write down "peace", right,

536
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:51,850
between the Jews and the Italians.

537
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:57,131
And war against the gypsies.

538
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,606
Fuck.

539
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,884
Mr Thomas Shelby, madam.

540
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,885
Nice house.

541
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,490
Would you like a whisky?

542
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,610
Scotch or Irish?

543
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,730
Irish.

544
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,450
Sorry for the short notice.

545
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,608
I was passing.

546
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,644
We're not quite on the Birmingham road.

547
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,889
It was a small diversion.

548
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,485
Sixty miles, I checked.

549
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,488
That's a small diversion these days.

550
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,845
So, I'm a small diversion.

551
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,160
Good.

552
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,804
Your horse is still out on the gallops,

553
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,689
but I had Mickey prepare this report.

554
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,723
You can read it now if you'd like,
then we can go see her.

555
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,927
--Is there enough light for you to read?

556
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,286
Yes, it's fine.

557
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,325
It's getting quite late.

558
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,121
Mickey says she has
the lungs of an elephant.

559
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,600
She's nimble in the heavy going,

560
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:01,966
but bounces a little on the hard ground.

561
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,211
Sorry, I'll let you read.

562
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,971
So, he thinks she'll favour
good to soft ground, eh?

563
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,602
- A little juice in the grass.
-Mmm.

564
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,369
Well, that's good for Epsom.

565
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:21,046
Does he think she's
not good enough for Epsom?

566
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,844
She needs a lot of work.

567
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,330
The race board will need convincing.

568
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,330
- I imagine you have some influence.
-Mmm.

569
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,368
That's the suggested programme
for the next two months.

570
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,805
Your glass is empty.

571
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,770
It's fine.

572
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,570
Are you hungry?

573
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,610
Yes, a bit.

574
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,731
I can prepare something.

575
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:53,491
Do you have engine oil?

576
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:59,045
Before I set off for Birmingham,
the car needs oil.

577
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,924
I'm sure my husband
kept some in the garage.

578
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,411
I can get someone to do it.

579
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,243
This evening or tomorrow?

580
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:14,011
Well, we're so far from anywhere,
people usually stay over.

581
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,443
Especially before cars,
when it was just carriages,

582
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:20,170
people used to stay over all the time.

583
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,285
But I have a car.

584
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,771
Yes.

585
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:30,164
And you have engine oil.

586
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,610
Probably.

587
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,684
But it would be very usual.

588
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:41,405
What would?

589
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,206
For a guest to stay.

590
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,044
We have a whole wing
called the guest wing.

591
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,085
Oh, you...

592
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:50,966
You have a guest wing.

593
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,565
Well...

594
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,330
May.

595
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,084
Have a smoke.

596
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,810
Thank you.

597
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,883
Ignore this. It's actually all right.

598
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:32,566
I put all his photos
in a drawer and locked it...

599
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,923
As if that was going
to make a difference.

600
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,602
I'm like a fucking lighthouse keeper...

601
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,370
Out here on my own...

602
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,728
Keeping his flame burning.

603
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:55,486
But, of course,
when anyone sees a lighthouse

604
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,651
they steer clear, don't they?

605
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:10,925
Now, do you have a map?

606
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:16,602
Of the house. Do you have a map?

607
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:23,205
Because I'm not going to be able
to find my way in the dark.

608
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,490
You see, at midnight,

609
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:33,404
I'm going to leave my wing

610
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:35,605
and I'm going to come find you.

611
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:40,449
And I'm going to turn the handle
of your bedroom door

612
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,488
without making a sound

613
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,289
and none of the maids will know.

614
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,365
You don't know maids.

615
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,405
They hear a pin drop?

616
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:55,085
If there's a man in the house,
they listen.

617
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,605
They take turns.

618
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:00,489
So, let them listen.

619
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:09,361
Right. Day rate, seven shillings.
Loading, unloading.

620
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:12,205
Night rate, three. Total ten.

621
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,764
Let's go and get a drink.

622
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:16,251
No, I'm all right.

623
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,925
Come on, it's payday.

624
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:19,451
Everybody has a drink on payday.

625
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,051
Not me.

626
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:23,481
You think your mum
don't have a drink on payday?

627
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:28,331
You think the Lord Almighty
don't have a drink on payday?

628
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:32,088
Man, it's on fire out there,

629
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:35,164
women from the BSA offices, honest.

630
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:38,051
They go out on their own
without their men these days,

631
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:39,451
in twos and threes now.

632
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:44,361
Mickey, they go out in twos and
threes and buy their own drinks.

633
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:53,644
The Marquis,
that's where the BSA secretaries go.

634
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:02,481
Look, they won't serve a black man
without a Shelby by his side.

635
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:09,130
So you're using me?

636
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,491
Yeah.

637
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:15,085
Come on.

638
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:25,604
I told you, I fucking told you,
this city's gone mad.

639
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,570
Girls go out on their own now.

640
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,643
Two pints of dark mild, please.

641
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,649
Fuck that. We're Peaky boys.

642
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:36,171
Two whiskies.

643
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:46,522
You get used to it, then you can't stop.

644
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,568
I don't drink with blacks.

645
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:57,370
Here we fucking go.

646
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,807
Paddy, they're okay.

647
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,526
Not with me, they're not.

648
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,568
I don't drink in pubs with blacks.

649
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:04,971
So leave.

650
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:08,406
Look, my dad is the preacher round here.

651
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,409
He has connections, ask anybody.

652
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:12,726
I couldn't give a fuck who he is.

653
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:15,050
I'm telling you to leave it, Paddy.

654
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,726
And I'm telling this darkie
to get out of here.

655
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,211
You know something? Fuck off.

656
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,009
It's all right, Isaiah, come on,
leave it.

657
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:23,367
- We'll go to my cousin's pub.
-I like it here.

658
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,843
You fucking nigger.

659
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:51,286
Paddy! The white kid's a Peaky Blinder!

660
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,090
He's Polly Shelby's son!

661
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:58,520
He's Polly Shelby's son!
Are you fucking suicidal?

662
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,490
Sir...

663
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:01,800
Sir, I'm sorry, I didn't know.

664
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,570
Get out!

665
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,085
Get out the fucking pub.

666
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:06,924
I clearly didn't know.

667
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,248
Fuck, let's go. Let's go!

668
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:13,323
We ordered some drinks

669
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:15,364
and we're going to drink them.

670
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:29,046
His face, man.
Did you see his fucking face?

671
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:30,884
You punch like a fucking kangaroo.

672
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,930
I seen one once in a circus,
you punch like that.

673
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:36,969
All right, anyway,
I need a fucking drink.

674
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:39,771
- It's on you.
-It's on me? You just got paid.

675
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:41,251
Yeah, from you.

676
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:44,001
You can get a whisky,
maybe even a dark mild.

677
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:51,529
Fucking hell,
it's packed in here, isn't it?

678
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:53,566
So it's as easy as that?

679
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:56,962
Easy as that, John boy.
London, you wouldn't believe it.

680
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:58,765
Finn, stick your head in a bucket.

681
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:00,330
No.

682
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:02,727
The women, John boy, the women...

683
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,726
I've got this one,
she's a dancer, right?

684
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:07,609
She can do things with her...

685
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:13,207
If Finn would just piss off,
I'd explain a little bit better.

686
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:15,767
Well, if it's so good, why are you here?

687
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,449
Decent pints.

688
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,324
The cockneys can't get that right.

689
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,767
He misses us, Finn, that's what it is.

690
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,209
Here they are, look, junior Peaky boys.

691
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:32,762
What's happened to you?
You been scrapping?

692
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:35,770
Some idiots at the Marquis of Lorne.

693
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:38,605
Tried to stop me and Isaiah
from drinking, but it's all right.

694
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,211
We fought them off.

695
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,529
Arthur, we had to stand
our ground and we did.

696
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:46,206
The Marquis, eh? Where's your dad?

697
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:49,049
- Preaching.
-Right.

698
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:54,251
Don't nick any of me chips, Finn!

699
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,288
- Where are you going?
- We won't be long.

700
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:00,410
Where are they going?

701
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:01,720
The Marquis of Lorne.

702
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,405
Shame.

703
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,050
It was a nice pub.

704
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:04,451
Eh-up. Bet the big bastard got cut.

705
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,090
You didn't have to do that for me.

706
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:10,650
We didn't do it for you, Michael.

707
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,882
We did it for the good name
of the company.

708
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:16,361
None of this happened, all right?

709
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:18,408
Come on, let's go and get that drink.

710
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:47,770
The date has been set.

711
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:51,688
Three weeks from today.

712
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:56,844
You checked out his house?

713
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,369
There's coppers all over it.

714
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:03,689
You'll take care of them?

715
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:05,962
No. That would arouse suspicion.

716
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:09,249
You'll have to deal with them yourself.

717
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:13,844
And if a copper gets killed?

718
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:20,051
There will be no consequences
for you, I have given you my word.

719
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:22,009
Which I know to be worthless.

720
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:27,965
That is why I have been settling
my affairs in the event of my death.

721
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:34,450
And making your peace
with God, perhaps?

722
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,489
Well, good luck with that.

723
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:47,486
I have made arrangements
with men I trust.

724
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:51,522
If I should die,

725
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:53,045
then you will die.

726
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:56,011
Know that.

727
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,568
Ritz Hotel.

728
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:33,085
London, Piccadilly.

729
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:44,046
Hello?

730
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,245
<i>Hello?</i>

731
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,090
- Who was that?
-Call got cut.

732
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:57,927
<i>I guess the telephone lines
in England are not so good, huh?</i>

733
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,001
Hm.

734
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:11,001
