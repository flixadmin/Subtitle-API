1
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:40,420
Hi.

2
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:41,880
Hi friend.

3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,300
Are you in Oslo now?

4
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,280
No, my flight from Geneva is
booked so I'm here until tomorrow.

5
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,440
No..

6
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,720
But I'm in Oslo tomorrow afternoon.

7
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,340
But I'm going to the cabin tomorrow.

8
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,300
Oh yeah, that's true!

9
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,160
Where was it you're going?

10
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,040
To Ingrid's cabin,
with Igrid and Sara.

11
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,220
So nice! Who will drive you guys?

12
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,040
No, we'll take the bus.

13
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:16,720
The bus? Can't you wait?
If you wait a day, I can drive you.

14
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,600
But I've been looking forward
to the cabin for over a month.

15
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,720
Yeah, I know.

16
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,560
But I'm coming home on Saturday.

17
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:36,020
Yeah.. On Saturday I-

18
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,920
It looks like I'll
leave again on Friday night.

19
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:49,320
Do you have enough money?

20
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,580
Yeah.

21
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,900
I'll wire you a little bit extra,
so you guys can have fun.

22
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,960
Thanks.

23
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,820
Okay, have a good trip
and say hi to Igrid and Sara.

24
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,980
Yeah, thanks. You too.

25
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,880
Okay, we'll talk.
-We will. Take care!

26
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,680
Sorry, sorry!
-Isak!

27
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,800
Should we send him home?
-Okay, we'll just do that.

28
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,920
What time is it even?

29
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,860
Eh, ten past nine.
-Ten past nine?!

30
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,500
Why did you come so fucking early?

31
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,360
Play "I'm Yours".
-No!

32
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,860
You only know gay songs.
-Shut up! Is that a gay song?

33
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:42,800
Who is it?

34
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,340
Jonas?

35
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,000
Elias.

36
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,680
Your new lover?

37
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,760
What are you talking about?

38
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:59,560
You know what I'm talking about.
You ran after him the entire school day.

39
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,560
Hello?

40
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:06,440
Oh, Elias? I'm so happy to be talking to you.
I think I love you.

41
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:13,040
Maybe we can get married. Then we'll go on our
honeymoon in March and live alone for the rest of our lives.

42
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,420
Love each other.

43
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:30,000
What's the deal with Jonas and Ingrid?
-Huh?

44
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,240
You heard what I said.

45
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,520
You have to ask Jonas.

46
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,760
Why do you ask?

47
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,560
I saw a notification on his phone.

48
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,000
I know that you know something.

49
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,720
Can't you just say it?
I promise I won't get angry.

50
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,840
I promise I won't 
tell Jonas you said something.

51
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,300
They text?

52
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,660
Maybe a little.

53
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:00,700
In which stadium does the
English Cup Final take place? -Wembley.

54
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,960
That's correct.

55
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,100
What bone in your body 
gets broken most often? -Collarbone.

56
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:06,960
Yep.

57
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:11,300
Who was the first 
president of the USA?

58
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,880
George Washington.

59
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:18,540
Okay, Eva. Who was the
first female Prime Minister of Norway?

60
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,680
I'm not joining.

61
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,620
She can't answer.

62
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:28,500
I do, I just don't want to join.
-Just answer, then we won't nag anymore.

63
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,780
I didn't hear the question.
-Who was Norway's first female Prime Minister?

64
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,880
Erna Solberg.

65
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,280
Fuck you guys!

66
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,520
Why are you so pissed?

67
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:50,660
I'm not pissed. I just think
Trivial Pursuit is boring.

68
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,140
Okay?

69
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,800
What do you want to play, then?
Something that isn't so boring.

70
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,420
Nothing. I want to read.

71
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,700
Come on! You must
want to do something.

72
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,040
Okay.

73
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:07,360
I want to play "My ship is loaded with.."
-Then we'll play "My ship".

74
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,800
I'll start.

75
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:14,380
My ship is loaded with Ingrid.

76
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,200
My ship is loaded with Erna Solberg.

77
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,860
Okay, eh.. My ship is loaded with insects.

78
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,860
My ship is loaded with ice.

79
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,360
My ship is loaded with-

80
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,680
What the fuck?
What was that?

81
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,180
Shit. Fuck.

82
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,560
Did you see it?
-No.

83
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,560
So weird.
-Really strange.

84
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,680
It's..

85
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,840
Hello?

86
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,700
Hi!
-The fuck?

87
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,900
Elias!
-Jonas!

88
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,520
What's up?
-You came!

89
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,620
Of course I came!

90
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:24,080
How did you find it?
-Embedded GPS in my brain.

91
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:28,100
No, I asked a guy
at the parking space up there.

92
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,860
Hello.
-Hello.

93
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,740
Hello.
-Hi.

94
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,060
So this is where you guys hang?
-Really cool.

95
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,400
Good atmosphere at least.

96
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,400
It'll be a party.

97
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,640
Where should I sleep?

98
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,560
In the bedroom with Isak.

99
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,840
I'll sleep with the gay guy?
-Why is everyone calling me gay?

100
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,720
You are gay.

101
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,000
He's joking. Have a little humor.

102
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:18,760
What? He asked if he
could come. What should I have said?

103
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,560
That was really awesome.
-Yeah, it works now.

104
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,660
Do you need help?

105
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,700
You set the table?
Yes.

106
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,800
Hm, looks good. Can I taste it?

107
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,580
Good.

108
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,020
We're gonna have a smoke.

109
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,220
Smoke?

110
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,400
Yeah, a smoke.
-You don't even smoke.

111
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,040
Come on, it's a party.

112
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,400
Yeah, it's a party.

113
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,120
You really don't need help?
-No.

114
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,420
Food's ready!

115
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,760
Jonas!

116
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,320
Seriously?

117
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,680
Not funny.
-It's a little funny.

118
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,100
You're able to
help yourself, aren't you?

119
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,520
Why are you so pissed all the time?

120
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,720
I'm pissed because
you're behaving like a complete jerk.

121
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,940
Jerk? What did I do?

122
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,740
Say what I did!

123
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,420
You invited loads of people
to a cabin trip that was just supposed to be us.

124
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,600
Two guys?
-Yes.

125
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:27,100
You change personalities
once Elias is around.

126
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:33,640
And you're texting with Ingrid behind my back,
when you know how much of a bitch she is to me!

127
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,380
Ingrid? I'm not going behind your
back talking to Ingrid!

128
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:40,340
What did she say I did?
-You think I don't know you text her?

129
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,240
I texted with her about French.
-About French?

130
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,440
During fall break?
-We have homework for after the break.

131
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,920
Yeah okay, if it's about French,
I can read the messages.

132
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,960
Why would you read my messages?
-You can read my messages!

133
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,200
I don't need to read your messages.
-Why?

134
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,860
You have to read my messages
so we can trust each other? -Yeah.
<i>[He talked so fast here wtf, I really don't know if I got it right.]</i>

135
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,040
That's ridiculous!
-Jonas!

136
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,760
This is ridiculous!

137
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:08,180
What the fuck? Why do
you think that I talk to Ingrid?

138
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,580
It's true, right?
-Yeah, about school!

139
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:15,180
Can I see your messages?
-I already told you it's ridiculous!

140
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:17,060
Why don't you trust me?
