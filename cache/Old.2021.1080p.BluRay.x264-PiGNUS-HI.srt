00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:32,258
Give me the Calcium Bomb juice.

164
00:10:33,551 --> 00:10:37,263
And maybe you could
recommend one of these.

165
00:10:40,975 --> 00:10:41,976
This one.

166
00:10:42,852 --> 00:10:45,146
[waiter]
I recommend the granola parfait.

167
00:10:47,106 --> 00:10:48,232
It's a good choice.

168
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:49,483
Okay.

169
00:10:49,567 --> 00:10:51,443
So, how is the Capa family?

170
00:10:51,527 --> 00:10:52,736
Any plans today?

171
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:56,574
Well, one of our kids
wants to do Jet Ski.

172
00:10:56,657 --> 00:11:00,452
And the other one
wants to do anything but that.

173
00:11:00,536 --> 00:11:01,662
Aha.

174
00:11:02,288 --> 00:11:04,373
Well, there's, um...

175
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:07,585
there's a private beach
on the nature preserve side of the island.

176
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:09,211
It's impossible to find.

177
00:11:09,295 --> 00:11:12,548
It's surrounded by stunning rocks,
very unusual minerals.

178
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:15,426
It's a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

179
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:17,344
A natural anomaly.

180
00:11:18,888 --> 00:11:21,307
I only recommend it to certain guests.

181
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:24,226
But I liked you guys immediately.
All right?

182
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:28,147
You're a nice family.
So I could arrange a van to take you, if...

183
00:11:28,731 --> 00:11:29,732
Yeah.

184
00:11:30,441 --> 00:11:32,651
Sounds like a great memory for us.

185
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:35,863
It's our little secret.
I'll make all the arrangements.

186
00:11:37,448 --> 00:11:39,008
- [Prisca] Thank you.
- [Guy] Thank you.

187
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:40,367
[Maddox] Thanks.

188
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:45,539
Okay, so I think we should get
the Calloway Kale-away for Trent.

189
00:11:45,623 --> 00:11:49,001
Idlib, what did I tell you about
being in here when you shouldn't?

190
00:11:50,211 --> 00:11:52,713
You can't...
You know, I told you so many times.

191
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:54,256
You know, we have certain rules...

192
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,716
[glass shatters]

193
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,143
I'm a doctor.

194
00:12:06,227 --> 00:12:07,645
My wife has epilepsy.

195
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:09,813
I'm a nurse. My name is Jarin.

196
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:12,524
Right, she's having a grand mal seizure.

197
00:12:12,608 --> 00:12:14,526
Keep things away from her, please.

198
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:15,736
[coughing]

199
00:12:18,197 --> 00:12:19,198
Patricia?

200
00:12:20,366 --> 00:12:21,367
Doll.

201
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,637
Jack, I think if you just
leave her lying here for a while,

202
00:12:23,661 --> 00:12:25,513
put something under her head.
I think she'll be fine.

203
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:28,040
Thank you, Doctor.
It's Jarin, by the way.

204
00:12:31,627 --> 00:12:34,713
For my next act,
I'll spin my head around 360.

205
00:12:34,797 --> 00:12:36,090
[laughs]

206
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:39,593
I'm sorry I ruined everyone's breakfast.

207
00:12:39,677 --> 00:12:41,553
You always want to be
the center of attention.

208
00:12:41,637 --> 00:12:42,763
[laughs]

209
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:46,684
My goodness.
Let's get you something to drink?

210
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:47,768
Yeah.

211
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:51,313
- [soft music playing over radio]
- [phone keys tapping]

212
00:12:56,902 --> 00:12:57,987
Idlib.

213
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,533
[car door opens]

214
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:05,327
[car door closes]

215
00:13:06,704 --> 00:13:08,163
[engine starts]

216
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:10,958
[car door opens]

217
00:13:12,001 --> 00:13:14,795
[doctor] Can't be that secret a beach.
We were told to keep it quiet.

218
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:17,756
- So were we.
- [woman] Sit down, Gustav. Good boy.

219
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,510
- Good boy. Stay.
- [dog barks]

220
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:26,056
- [car door closes]
- [driver] Okay, guest checklist.

221
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,975
Books, sunscreen.

222
00:13:28,976 --> 00:13:31,312
Did everybody
leave their passports in their safes?

223
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:33,605
- I don't want anybody to lose anything.
- [Guy] Yeah.

224
00:13:34,315 --> 00:13:36,358
What are your names and occupations?

225
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:48,370
[lock rattling]

226
00:14:07,765 --> 00:14:09,016
It's very rocky here.

227
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:10,601
Okay, my friends.

228
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,020
You can just call us,

229
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:15,564
and we'll pick you up
whenever you're ready to come back.

230
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:17,483
Or I'll pick you up at 5:00 p.m.

231
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:19,568
Just follow the path down to the beach.

232
00:14:20,277 --> 00:14:21,862
- [Guy] Is that also food?
- Yeah.

233
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:25,157
Wow, that's a lot of food.

234
00:14:25,741 --> 00:14:29,161
Well, kids eat a lot of food.
And you got three of them with you.

235
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:30,662
Okay.

236
00:14:30,746 --> 00:14:33,248
[grunts] Seems like a waste,
but thank you.

237
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:39,254
Could you help us
carry some of these bags, please?

238
00:14:39,338 --> 00:14:41,507
We've got an elderly person here
and a child.

239
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:44,426
I'm sorry. I gotta get back.
But it's not far.

240
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:47,012
Just walk down.
You'll see a beautiful slot canyon.

241
00:14:47,096 --> 00:14:50,265
Walk through that, and in a few minutes,
you'll be there. Enjoy, everybody!

242
00:14:50,349 --> 00:14:52,226
- Do you think there's...
- Come on.

243
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:55,187
- Do you think there's snakes?
- Of course.

244
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,106
Cool. I wanna see one.

245
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:00,317
- [Maddox] Gorgeous.
- [Trent] Wow.

246
00:15:00,401 --> 00:15:02,319
[laughter]

247
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:06,240
Okay.

248
00:15:08,826 --> 00:15:11,870
You okay? Yeah?

249
00:15:17,418 --> 00:15:19,420
[chattering]

250
00:15:25,676 --> 00:15:28,637
[children laughing and shouting]

251
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:34,184
[girl] Could someone please
tell me what just happened?

252
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:35,936
Look out.

253
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:38,230
- This is so exciting!
- Careful now.

254
00:15:47,156 --> 00:15:48,782
[laughter]

255
00:15:48,866 --> 00:15:50,659
- [Maddox] Let's go!
- [Trent] I'm gonna win!

256
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:52,119
[Maddox] Whoo!

257
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:53,745
[laughter]

258
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:21,273
Wow. I just got chills.

259
00:16:23,734 --> 00:16:26,653
Come on, darling.
Let's show Gustav the sea.

260
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:30,949
[Guy] Hey, Maddox, help your mom.

261
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:32,826
Listen, I... Let's move somewhere else.

262
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:35,037
I think it's much nicer
closer to the water, right?

263
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,623
- Yeah, but I...
- No, it's... Look. It's beautiful.

264
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:38,749
[Maddox] I got you!

265
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:54,139
[woman] Have you ever
seen anything like that?

266
00:16:54,223 --> 00:16:55,474
[cheering]

267
00:16:56,225 --> 00:16:58,393
- [camera clicking]
- [Gustav barking]

268
00:16:58,477 --> 00:17:00,562
[woman] They were right to send us.

269
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,190
- [continue barking]
- Lie down.

270
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:04,858
[rattling]

271
00:17:04,942 --> 00:17:07,110
Yeah. Good boy!

272
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:08,487
[laughter and chatter]

273
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:10,572
[Guy] Kids, look at the beautiful coral.

274
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:16,411
- What are you going to do?
- [Maddox] Now I'm gonna splash you.

275
00:17:16,495 --> 00:17:18,413
Just keep on reading, I guess.

276
00:17:18,497 --> 00:17:19,873
[Trent] You just splashed me.

277
00:17:20,582 --> 00:17:23,168
Stop! I didn't mean you could splash me.

278
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:25,420
Guy?

279
00:17:25,504 --> 00:17:26,505
Yeah.

280
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:29,007
What book am I reading?

281
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:30,551
[kids continue laughing]

282
00:17:34,096 --> 00:17:35,305
I don't know.

283
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:38,100
Why?

284
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:40,811
No reason.

285
00:17:45,524 --> 00:17:48,694
[Guy] Prisca,
I wanted to tell you something.

286
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:55,367
No, never mind.

287
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:57,202
I'll tell you later.

288
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,167
Oh, my God.

289
00:18:05,127 --> 00:18:06,962
That's Mid-Sized Sedan.

290
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:08,505
[Guy] What? Mid what?

291
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:09,923
He's a rapper!

292
00:18:10,007 --> 00:18:11,717
"More Dough for the Cookin" '?

293
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:15,071
- [Guy] Mid-Sized Sedan?
- [Trent] Let's begin an activity.

294
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:16,722
Dad, I have to, okay? I have to!

295
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:19,391
- No. Leave him. Because it's a private...
- Sounds like fun.

296
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:22,644
- But, Dad, stop! I need to say hi.
- He's on vacation, he's on vacation.

297
00:18:22,728 --> 00:18:24,354
What's his surname? Sedan?

298
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:26,315
Whoo!

299
00:18:26,398 --> 00:18:27,983
[laughing]

300
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:29,484
Oh!

301
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:35,365
Whoa, all right.
Here's a big one. Wow.

302
00:18:35,449 --> 00:18:37,200
Help me with this.

303
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,413
We should have a housewarming party.

304
00:18:42,664 --> 00:18:44,875
Isn't our house so beautiful?

305
00:18:58,472 --> 00:19:00,432
- Boo!
- Aah! You!

306
00:19:00,515 --> 00:19:01,933
- Come! Come back here!
- No!

307
00:19:02,017 --> 00:19:03,727
[laughter]

308
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:04,811
Not gonna get me!

309
00:19:04,895 --> 00:19:07,022
Kara, you know,
I'm gonna get you right now.

310
00:19:07,773 --> 00:19:08,774
Come on.

311
00:19:08,857 --> 00:19:09,900
Not gonna get me!

312
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:10,984
Oh, I am.

313
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:13,111
Come on, Kara.

314
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:16,114
Oh!

315
00:19:16,198 --> 00:19:17,741
Oh, my God. Got you.

316
00:19:21,662 --> 00:19:23,080
You're never gonna catch me.

317
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:27,459
[Kara] Honey, I'm home.

318
00:19:27,542 --> 00:19:30,253
[Trent]
I told you, I don't wanna live like this.

319
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:32,297
I'm gonna live in a condominium.

320
00:19:32,381 --> 00:19:34,508
I'm going for a drive to calm down.

321
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:38,053
I'm really, really hungry.

322
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:41,056
Me, too. My stomach's growling.

323
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:42,140
Me, too.

324
00:19:57,531 --> 00:19:58,657
[Maddox] Wow.

325
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:01,576
Who would leave this?

326
00:20:02,786 --> 00:20:03,787
Hey, Mom!

327
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:06,415
From the hotel.

328
00:20:07,082 --> 00:20:09,000
They're so rusted.

329
00:20:09,084 --> 00:20:10,293
Put that down!

330
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:13,004
You can get infected
or you'll cut yourself!

331
00:20:13,922 --> 00:20:15,215
Come away.

332
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:16,299
Next activity.

333
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:18,194
- What's happening?
- Let's play hide-and-seek.

334
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:20,679
I don't know. They found stuff
from the hotel in the sand.

335
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:25,934
[Maddox] Eighteen, nineteen, twenty.

336
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:28,353
- No fish.
- Ready or not, here we come!

337
00:20:30,981 --> 00:20:32,607
[chuckles]

338
00:20:45,537 --> 00:20:46,538
Mom!

339
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:49,833
Mom! Mom!

340
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,835
Mom! Mom!

341
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:53,628
Mom!

342
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:58,759
- What is it? What is it?
- [Guy] Trent!

343
00:20:58,842 --> 00:21:00,010
Someone over there.

344
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:01,094
Over there.

345
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:13,857
Come on. Give me a hand. Get the legs.

346
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:14,941
Yes.

347
00:21:24,326 --> 00:21:26,453
- Make your list. Make your list.
- Okay.

348
00:21:26,536 --> 00:21:27,829
Red and orange.

349
00:21:27,913 --> 00:21:29,956
Red, orange. Come away from here, babies.

350
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,709
Let the doctor try and help this lady.
Yeah?

351
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:34,252
- [Trent] Green.
- [Prisca] Green.

352
00:21:36,797 --> 00:21:37,839
- Tan.
- Tan.

353
00:21:37,923 --> 00:21:38,924
- Purple.
- Purple.

354
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:40,487
- [Maddox] What happened?
- It's okay.

355
00:21:41,384 --> 00:21:43,303
Blue. Blue is good. And then?

356
00:21:43,386 --> 00:21:44,906
- [Trent] Green.
- [Prisca] Green, yes.

357
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:47,241
- [Trent] Yellow. Purple.
- [Prisca] Yellow. I love yellow.

358
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:48,558
[Guy] Call the police, right?

359
00:21:48,642 --> 00:21:49,768
[doctor] I'll get my mobile.

360
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,604
Oh, damn.

361
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:15,001
[Maddox]
What happened to her, Mom?

362
00:22:15,085 --> 00:22:16,378
I don't know.

363
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:18,463
[Trent] I'm still hungry.

364
00:22:18,547 --> 00:22:19,756
Me, too.

365
00:22:21,883 --> 00:22:23,093
[Guy] Was she with you?

366
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:24,736
[Mid-Sized Sedan]
I was waiting for her.

367
00:22:25,387 --> 00:22:27,806
She swam out by herself, yo.

368
00:22:28,932 --> 00:22:30,642
I don't know what the hell happened.

369
00:22:31,268 --> 00:22:32,769
I ain't saying nothing else.

370
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:36,231
Did you strike him?
I don't need to know the context of...

371
00:22:36,314 --> 00:22:38,066
What? No. Of course not.

372
00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:39,526
So why's your nose bleeding?

373
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:43,530
I told y'all,
I ain't got nothing to say to you.

374
00:22:47,242 --> 00:22:49,327
My chest feels funny.

375
00:22:50,871 --> 00:22:55,584
Well, you know, we should've
gotten a yacht like I suggested, Agnes.

376
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:57,544
You shouldn't have fought me on that.

377
00:22:58,503 --> 00:23:01,464
You see? Now we're mixed up
in some island issue.

378
00:23:01,548 --> 00:23:02,924
I mean, I... [scoffs]

379
00:23:08,471 --> 00:23:12,100
[Trent] Mom, my swimsuit is hurting.
I have to take it off.

380
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:14,436
Well, just loosen your...

381
00:23:20,275 --> 00:23:21,818
[Guy] We're from Philadelphia.

382
00:23:21,902 --> 00:23:24,154
I'm on a break here
with my wife and kids. That's them.

383
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:26,948
Well, yeah, over there.

384
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:32,203
And for the record,
I know most people who die on vacation

385
00:23:32,287 --> 00:23:36,207
die from sun exposure, overexertion,

386
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:38,376
overindulgence of food or alcohol,

387
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:41,963
or a mixture of all of the above
99.4% of the time.

388
00:23:42,047 --> 00:23:44,090
- How you know all this?
- I'm an actuary.

389
00:23:44,174 --> 00:23:47,385
I calculate people's insurance rates
based on their risk profile.

390
00:23:49,721 --> 00:23:51,348
I ain't do nothing, man.

391
00:23:54,434 --> 00:23:55,810
She was into me.

392
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:00,523
Somebody will figure this out.

393
00:24:01,566 --> 00:24:03,735
We'll just have to wait
for them to get here.

394
00:24:03,818 --> 00:24:06,321
[doctor] No reception at all.

395
00:24:07,072 --> 00:24:09,407
I guess our beach day's over.

396
00:24:09,491 --> 00:24:11,701
We've gotta keep an eye on him
and the body.

397
00:24:11,785 --> 00:24:14,245
[laughs] Whoo!

398
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,290
Oh, my goodness.

399
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:19,584
Wow.

400
00:24:22,504 --> 00:24:24,547
[doctor] Did you just get dropped off
by the resort?

401
00:24:24,631 --> 00:24:28,176
Yeah. We were supposed to come earlier,
but we rested in the room first.

402
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:31,012
Great. We have to get the resort people
before they leave.

403
00:24:31,096 --> 00:24:32,856
I think we will all
have to leave this beach.

404
00:24:32,931 --> 00:24:35,642
Wait. Why? They left already.

405
00:24:35,725 --> 00:24:36,893
What happened?

406
00:24:49,322 --> 00:24:50,949
We really don't know what happened.

407
00:24:51,032 --> 00:24:53,118
Well, I think this man
had something to do with it.

408
00:24:53,201 --> 00:24:56,329
Man, if I was involved, why would I
be standing around, bro? Damn.

409
00:24:56,413 --> 00:24:59,708
His nose is bleeding. I think he got that
when she was trying to defend herself.

410
00:24:59,791 --> 00:25:01,251
I don't like this dynamic at all.

411
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:04,295
My nose has been bleeding for hours, man.
I don't know why it's doing that.

412
00:25:04,379 --> 00:25:08,341
Charles, something's wrong with
your mother. She's asking for you, honey.

413
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,928
Well, we're all in this now.

414
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:14,514
We are responsible for that woman.

415
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:18,727
And I've got nothing against this man.
I'm just doing what needs to be done.

416
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,813
[Jarin] No cell phone reception
on this beach.

417
00:25:21,896 --> 00:25:22,897
You stay here.

418
00:25:22,981 --> 00:25:25,984
I'll go to the clearing in the jungle
where they dropped us and try to call.

419
00:25:26,067 --> 00:25:29,654
They obviously have a signal out here.
How else do people call to go back?

420
00:25:40,915 --> 00:25:43,251
[grunts, gasps]

421
00:25:47,964 --> 00:25:49,132
[woman] Oh, my God.

422
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,343
You stumbled back out,
you were holding your head.

423
00:25:52,427 --> 00:25:54,262
You looked like you were in pain, babe.

424
00:25:55,555 --> 00:25:56,681
[Guy] You blacked out.

425
00:25:58,183 --> 00:25:59,851
I felt this pressure in my head.

426
00:26:04,939 --> 00:26:06,149
[Agnes] I'm fine, Charles.

427
00:26:07,275 --> 00:26:08,651
I think it's the shock.

428
00:26:08,735 --> 00:26:09,736
[Gustav barking]

429
00:26:09,819 --> 00:26:11,905
Try to help Gustav or he'll be sick.

430
00:26:11,988 --> 00:26:13,281
Yeah, of course it's the shock.

431
00:26:13,364 --> 00:26:15,492
I'm gonna get a van
to take us back to the resort,

432
00:26:15,575 --> 00:26:17,660
but first I've got to deal
with all this, all right?

433
00:26:18,453 --> 00:26:19,662
Are you okay?

434
00:26:19,746 --> 00:26:20,747
Yeah.

435
00:26:21,414 --> 00:26:23,083
I know you've been stressed.

436
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:25,335
Don't let this upset you.

437
00:26:26,336 --> 00:26:28,546
Help these people through this, Charles.

438
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:30,173
[Gustav barking]

439
00:26:30,256 --> 00:26:31,633
So, what did you hear?

440
00:26:33,718 --> 00:26:35,929
Help these people through this, Charles.

441
00:26:36,012 --> 00:26:37,180
[Prisca] Excuse me.

442
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:42,644
Excuse me.
I saw you were talking to my husband.

443
00:26:42,727 --> 00:26:45,647
I know you're dealing with a lot
with that woman right now,

444
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:48,358
but something is wrong with my son.
Some kind of reaction.

445
00:26:48,441 --> 00:26:50,610
Is it severe? I don't have time for this.

446
00:26:50,693 --> 00:26:52,237
What kind of doctor are you?

447
00:26:52,904 --> 00:26:55,198
I'm a cardiothoracic surgeon
and chief medical officer.

448
00:26:55,949 --> 00:26:57,617
[Prisca] You don't know me.

449
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,911
I curate exhibits for museums.

450
00:27:00,578 --> 00:27:02,705
I'm telling you this
because I want you to trust me

451
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:04,916
and not think I'm being hysterical
when I say

452
00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:07,335
there's something very wrong
with my child.

453
00:27:07,418 --> 00:27:09,587
He seems fine to me.
He's playing with my daughter.

454
00:27:11,214 --> 00:27:13,007
[Trent] You look different, too.

455
00:27:13,091 --> 00:27:14,092
[Maddox] How?

456
00:27:14,968 --> 00:27:18,304
Huh? I don't know.
You just look different.

457
00:27:19,722 --> 00:27:20,932
Hold my hand.

458
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:22,642
Okay.

459
00:27:25,478 --> 00:27:28,481
Willow, Japanese maple.

460
00:27:29,691 --> 00:27:32,068
- Evergreen.
- If you get scared, just tell me, okay?

461
00:27:33,778 --> 00:27:35,238
What do you keep looking at?

462
00:27:35,989 --> 00:27:37,782
- [Trent] There.
- Where?

463
00:27:39,117 --> 00:27:41,953
[Trent] Way, way up there
on the side of the hillside.

464
00:27:42,036 --> 00:27:43,371
[Kara] What do you see?

465
00:27:43,454 --> 00:27:45,331
[Trent] I thought I saw something shiny.

466
00:27:46,583 --> 00:27:47,584
[Maddox] Here comes Mom.

467
00:27:51,171 --> 00:27:54,757
[woman] Charles!
She stopped breathing!

468
00:27:54,841 --> 00:27:56,551
She stopped breathing!

469
00:27:59,095 --> 00:28:01,139
I didn't do anything, Charles.

470
00:28:01,222 --> 00:28:03,141
You guys, you just walked away,

471
00:28:03,224 --> 00:28:05,602
and she just stopped breathing
all of a sudden.

472
00:28:05,685 --> 00:28:07,187
I mean, she was peaceful.

473
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:09,439
Can you step back, please?

474
00:28:09,522 --> 00:28:11,399
[Jarin] We'll take the kids
away from here.

475
00:28:11,983 --> 00:28:13,443
Is this happening?

476
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:15,737
[Gustav barking]

477
00:28:20,408 --> 00:28:21,492
[grunts]

478
00:28:24,495 --> 00:28:25,914
[both crying]

479
00:28:25,997 --> 00:28:27,582
She couldn't take the shock.

480
00:28:28,958 --> 00:28:31,961
She saw a murdered woman
and her heart couldn't take it.

481
00:28:33,046 --> 00:28:35,131
[Trent] What are your names
and occupations?

482
00:28:35,798 --> 00:28:37,800
I'm Jarin. I'm a nurse.

483
00:28:37,884 --> 00:28:40,720
I'm Patricia. I'm a psychologist.

484
00:28:40,803 --> 00:28:43,890
[Maddox] He remembers everyone's names
and things about them.

485
00:28:44,682 --> 00:28:46,309
Everything's gonna be okay.

486
00:28:47,268 --> 00:28:48,394
What's your name?

487
00:28:49,103 --> 00:28:51,981
I'm Trent.
This is my sister, Maddox.

488
00:28:52,065 --> 00:28:53,566
How old are you guys?

489
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:56,110
- I'll guess. I'm good at this.
- [chuckles]

490
00:28:56,694 --> 00:28:58,279
You're 11, right, Trent?

491
00:28:59,197 --> 00:29:00,406
[Trent] I'm six.

492
00:29:00,949 --> 00:29:04,410
No. Really, are you 10, 11?

493
00:29:04,494 --> 00:29:07,247
[Maddox]
He's not lying. He's six.

494
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:10,166
[Trent]
I'm specifically six and a quarter.

495
00:29:10,792 --> 00:29:11,876
She's 11.

496
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:16,256
They're feeling unsafe.
There is a lot going on here.

497
00:29:16,339 --> 00:29:19,467
They're playing with us. Let's leave it.

498
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:22,053
Okay, what's your best friend's name?

499
00:29:22,929 --> 00:29:24,138
[Trent] Maddox.

500
00:29:24,931 --> 00:29:26,182
How sweet.

501
00:29:26,766 --> 00:29:28,351
Have you seen my children?

502
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:29,769
[chuckles nervously]

503
00:29:29,852 --> 00:29:32,647
Is everyone trying to play a joke on us?

504
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:34,774
- What?
- Aren't these your children?

505
00:29:35,316 --> 00:29:36,609
[Trent] I'm right here, Mom.

506
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,363
[Maddox] Mom?

507
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,241
Mom.

508
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:53,960
Why are you looking at me like that?

509
00:30:04,595 --> 00:30:07,890
Prisca, I think we should leave.

510
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,601
Get the kids back to the resort.

511
00:30:10,685 --> 00:30:11,894
Guy...

512
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,748
- Maddox?
- Yeah. Dad, it's me.

513
00:30:35,835 --> 00:30:37,211
What's going on?

514
00:30:48,765 --> 00:30:50,933
You see? You see?

515
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:56,773
[panting]

516
00:31:08,034 --> 00:31:09,327
Holy...

517
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:10,745
[breathing heavily]

518
00:31:16,709 --> 00:31:19,337
[grunting]

519
00:31:21,506 --> 00:31:23,049
[grunting]

520
00:31:26,636 --> 00:31:28,429
[panting]

521
00:31:34,435 --> 00:31:35,561
[gasps]

522
00:31:43,277 --> 00:31:44,487
Damn.

523
00:31:45,405 --> 00:31:47,323
- How did we get here?
- [Prisca] Take it easy.

524
00:31:48,908 --> 00:31:52,537
[Charles] Intense cranial pressure.
It's like being deep underwater.

525
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:55,623
- I can't...
- Can you get up?

526
00:31:55,706 --> 00:31:56,791
Whoa. Whoa. Take it easy.

527
00:31:59,752 --> 00:32:01,170
Charles?

528
00:32:01,254 --> 00:32:03,423
- Yeah, no, I'm all right. I'm fine.
- You okay?

529
00:32:03,506 --> 00:32:05,925
We're leaving right now,
and we're taking our kids.

530
00:32:06,008 --> 00:32:08,928
For some reason,
people are blacking out going this way.

531
00:32:09,011 --> 00:32:10,596
Three people have blacked out now.

532
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,866
- That's ridiculous. Come, move.
- No, I saw it, Prisca.

533
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:13,933
I saw Jarin black out.

534
00:32:14,016 --> 00:32:18,479
What I know is that we have to get
these kids to a hospital. Now.

535
00:32:19,897 --> 00:32:22,150
Look, let's stop talking about it.

536
00:32:22,233 --> 00:32:23,568
The kids are scared.

537
00:32:23,651 --> 00:32:25,069
I can stay here with them.

538
00:32:25,153 --> 00:32:30,199
But everyone else should try and find
a different pathway off this beach.

539
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:33,995
[Jarin] Break off into groups of two
in case people black out.

540
00:32:36,414 --> 00:32:37,874
Chrystal, go with me.

541
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:53,181
[both grunting]

542
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:57,530
- Okay.
- Whatever you do, just stay close.

543
00:32:57,602 --> 00:32:59,812
I'm feeling very uncomfortable right now.

544
00:33:00,354 --> 00:33:01,898
[Charles] Don't get up too quickly.

545
00:33:01,981 --> 00:33:04,525
Kids, let Mom and Dad talk for a second.

546
00:33:04,609 --> 00:33:06,527
No. Mom, we're scared.

547
00:33:07,361 --> 00:33:09,614
Please. Stay right here.

548
00:33:10,573 --> 00:33:11,616
Okay?

549
00:33:12,867 --> 00:33:15,286
- If I cry, please don't let them see.
- I won't.

550
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:17,538
- Your hands are shaking.
- Yeah.

551
00:33:17,622 --> 00:33:18,748
- Yeah.
- Yeah, they are.

552
00:33:18,831 --> 00:33:20,458
Yeah. You okay?

553
00:33:21,751 --> 00:33:24,212
We're on a beach
with two unrelated dead bodies.

554
00:33:24,295 --> 00:33:26,255
That is just statistically impossible.

555
00:33:26,339 --> 00:33:28,257
All three kids are reacting to something.

556
00:33:28,341 --> 00:33:29,759
Only the kids.

557
00:33:29,842 --> 00:33:31,886
I mean, look at the doctor's daughter.

558
00:33:34,055 --> 00:33:36,182
The kids are reacting
to something they ate.

559
00:33:36,933 --> 00:33:38,893
Or they caught something.

560
00:33:38,976 --> 00:33:43,105
We're on a remote, undeveloped island,
but we have a doctor here.

561
00:33:43,189 --> 00:33:46,526
So, let's get the doctor
to look at the kids.

562
00:33:54,575 --> 00:33:56,911
I still can't get any reception.

563
00:33:57,495 --> 00:33:59,664
Doctor, before we do anything else,

564
00:33:59,747 --> 00:34:01,624
can you take a look
at our children, please?

565
00:34:02,917 --> 00:34:04,001
Oh!

566
00:34:05,086 --> 00:34:06,212
He's got a knife!

567
00:34:06,295 --> 00:34:07,630
[screaming]

568
00:34:07,713 --> 00:34:09,674
There's a damn hole in my cheek!

569
00:34:10,258 --> 00:34:13,344
- Oh, my God! Are you okay?
- Put that down right now, Doctor.

570
00:34:13,427 --> 00:34:14,804
Watch out, Jarin.

571
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:19,069
Listen, I don't know why I did that.
I thought he was gonna hurt me.

572
00:34:19,141 --> 00:34:20,309
Sorry.

573
00:34:22,061 --> 00:34:24,230
- Sorry.
- What's he talking about, "sorry"?

574
00:34:24,313 --> 00:34:26,649
- Let me see that laceration.
- That's assault, man!

575
00:34:26,732 --> 00:34:28,067
[Jarin] Calm down.

576
00:34:29,694 --> 00:34:30,945
What's your name?

577
00:34:32,071 --> 00:34:33,489
Mid-Sized Sedan.

578
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,078
I must be in shock. I'm numb.
I'm not feeling the pain no more.

579
00:34:39,161 --> 00:34:41,372
Please. Let me see.

580
00:34:49,589 --> 00:34:51,229
No, this is not making any sense, Prisca.

581
00:34:51,299 --> 00:34:53,968
[Mid-Sized Sedan]
I need to get my ass to a hospital now.

582
00:34:55,136 --> 00:34:56,887
What's with all y'all faces?

583
00:34:59,223 --> 00:35:00,891
It's hard to explain.

584
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:07,398
This is messed up, man.
Where'd it go?

585
00:35:07,481 --> 00:35:09,609
This is some kind of parlor trick.

586
00:35:09,692 --> 00:35:14,071
[Mid-Sized Sedan] Yo, I know
I tried to dip, but I am freaked, man.

587
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:17,283
I just wanna go back to my hotel room.

588
00:35:17,366 --> 00:35:20,745
This was supposed to be a zen trip, man.

589
00:35:20,828 --> 00:35:24,165
She and I only started talking
because she was sick, and so am I.

590
00:35:24,248 --> 00:35:27,460
She had just been diagnosed with MS,
so we started rapping about that.

591
00:35:27,543 --> 00:35:29,629
I didn't do nothing to that girl, man.

592
00:35:31,088 --> 00:35:33,549
She was like Michael Phelps
swimming out there,

593
00:35:33,633 --> 00:35:34,800
backstroking and whatnot.

594
00:35:34,884 --> 00:35:36,302
She swam way the hell out.

595
00:35:36,385 --> 00:35:37,637
What did you say?

596
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,805
No, I don't know, man.
Maybe it was butterfly stroke.

597
00:35:39,889 --> 00:35:41,609
I don't watch the Summer Olympics
like that.

598
00:35:41,682 --> 00:35:43,601
You came vacationing here
because you were sick,

599
00:35:43,684 --> 00:35:45,954
- and so did she?
- I thought that was a cool coincidence.

600
00:35:45,978 --> 00:35:49,649
Maybe this is some kind of
group psychosis. I've studied this.

601
00:35:49,732 --> 00:35:52,485
We're all emotionally shaky
from our lives.

602
00:35:52,568 --> 00:35:55,821
We don't believe
we can leave this beach.

603
00:36:00,076 --> 00:36:01,494
Mom.

604
00:36:01,577 --> 00:36:04,246
Is there any more food?
I'm still hungry.

605
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:07,476
- [Charles] Well, she's definitely aged.
- How can you still be hungry? We just...

606
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,252
I'd put her biological age
somewhere between 12 and 13,

607
00:36:10,336 --> 00:36:13,297
and she turned six
two weeks ago on Tuesday.

608
00:36:13,381 --> 00:36:14,465
What?

609
00:36:15,675 --> 00:36:17,093
We're older?

610
00:36:18,386 --> 00:36:19,804
Am I okay?

611
00:36:21,055 --> 00:36:23,891
I don't know what's happening
to the three of you, sweetheart.

612
00:36:23,974 --> 00:36:26,268
But for now,
I have another swimsuit in my bag,

613
00:36:26,352 --> 00:36:28,813
and maybe you should change into that.

614
00:36:29,772 --> 00:36:31,440
[Charles]
It might be a virus, maybe.

615
00:36:31,524 --> 00:36:33,150
Could be mosquitoes where...

616
00:36:33,234 --> 00:36:35,319
The way they behave
on this part of the island.

617
00:36:35,403 --> 00:36:37,905
Something's happening to her
that's triggering her hormones.

618
00:36:37,988 --> 00:36:39,407
[Jarin] The dog has died!

619
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:41,075
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

620
00:36:41,158 --> 00:36:42,159
[gasps]

621
00:36:42,243 --> 00:36:43,744
He was only just alive.

622
00:36:43,828 --> 00:36:46,163
- [Chrystal] Kara, hold on to me, baby.
- What's happening?

623
00:36:47,415 --> 00:36:49,625
[Jarin] Who thinks they can swim

624
00:36:49,709 --> 00:36:53,212
a hundred lengths of a pool
against currents,

625
00:36:53,295 --> 00:36:56,966
and then turn and swim
an unknown amount along the coast

626
00:36:57,049 --> 00:36:58,467
till we find another shore?

627
00:36:59,176 --> 00:37:03,931
That's what I'm guessing the distance is
to swim out and get around this cove.

628
00:37:15,443 --> 00:37:18,738
It looks too far. Babe, it's not safe.

629
00:37:19,947 --> 00:37:21,532
My name is Brendon.

630
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:23,325
I went to private school.

631
00:37:23,409 --> 00:37:26,078
My mom is an attorney,
and my dad is a dentist.

632
00:37:26,996 --> 00:37:29,874
- Yo, I just wanted somebody to know that.
- Okay.

633
00:37:29,957 --> 00:37:33,210
I have a problem with my blood.
A rare issue with its clotting.

634
00:37:33,294 --> 00:37:36,172
I came to this island to see the ocean

635
00:37:36,255 --> 00:37:39,717
and remember I'm connected
to something bigger.

636
00:37:40,342 --> 00:37:42,344
That's beautiful, Brendon.

637
00:37:43,554 --> 00:37:46,557
I don't feel the same way
I felt yesterday or this morning,

638
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,018
and I don't think
my parents would understand.

639
00:37:50,019 --> 00:37:52,480
My thoughts have more colors in them now.

640
00:37:53,773 --> 00:37:56,734
Yesterday, I had a few colors
and they were really strong,

641
00:37:56,817 --> 00:37:59,904
and now I have more and they're quieter.

642
00:38:00,446 --> 00:38:01,572
[Patricia] Okay!

643
00:38:01,655 --> 00:38:02,656
[clapping]

644
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,825
Everyone, gather!

645
00:38:04,909 --> 00:38:06,827
Come on, come on, come on!

646
00:38:06,911 --> 00:38:09,413
Everyone needs to have a voice here.

647
00:38:09,955 --> 00:38:11,749
[Guy] Are you sure we have time for this?

648
00:38:11,832 --> 00:38:14,752
We will make destructive decisions
if we don't feel safe with each other.

649
00:38:14,835 --> 00:38:18,339
I know we don't have time,
but why don't we start with you two?

650
00:38:19,089 --> 00:38:20,466
Why are you here?

651
00:38:23,677 --> 00:38:26,096
- We've been having a tough time...
- Chrystal.

652
00:38:26,764 --> 00:38:28,432
We've been going through something.

653
00:38:28,516 --> 00:38:31,268
He's under a lot of stress as a doctor.
He needed some time away.

654
00:38:31,352 --> 00:38:33,187
Everyone does.
I'm not unusual in that.

655
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:35,815
Charles, it's okay.
I'm not gonna say anything else.

656
00:38:35,898 --> 00:38:38,609
Good! It's nice to hear from you both.

657
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:40,986
How about you guys?

658
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:46,408
Prisca?

659
00:38:46,492 --> 00:38:47,827
It's nothing.

660
00:38:48,494 --> 00:38:50,913
We just have to make a decision.

661
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:52,873
The kids are reacting to something.

662
00:38:52,957 --> 00:38:55,793
It's a virus. It's probably a virus.

663
00:38:56,919 --> 00:38:58,879
I just need to catch my breath.

664
00:38:58,963 --> 00:39:00,965
I just started feeling weird a minute ago.

665
00:39:01,048 --> 00:39:02,508
[Maddox] Are you okay, Mom?

666
00:39:02,591 --> 00:39:04,301
- Mom?
- [Jarin] What's wrong?

667
00:39:04,385 --> 00:39:05,469
[Maddox] Are you okay, Mom?

668
00:39:05,553 --> 00:39:07,429
[Prisca] I don't think it's the...

669
00:39:07,513 --> 00:39:09,306
- [Guy] She has a tumor.
- [Maddox] What?

670
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:11,150
[Guy] But it's benign.
They said it's benign.

671
00:39:11,225 --> 00:39:12,351
Oh, my God.

672
00:39:12,434 --> 00:39:13,602
[Maddox] Mom?

673
00:39:15,396 --> 00:39:17,314
Is it... Where?

674
00:39:17,398 --> 00:39:19,400
- [Maddox] Mom?
- It's okay.

675
00:39:19,483 --> 00:39:20,818
Can I...

676
00:39:20,901 --> 00:39:23,070
I can feel it.
It's the size of a golf ball.

677
00:39:23,153 --> 00:39:25,906
[Prisca] No, it's supposed to be
three centimeters.

678
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:27,825
[Charles] All right. Let me see.

679
00:39:27,908 --> 00:39:29,618
- [Guy] Whoa! Prisca!
- [Maddox] Mom!

680
00:39:29,702 --> 00:39:31,161
- She's gonna faint.
- Prisca.

681
00:39:31,245 --> 00:39:32,246
Mom.

682
00:39:32,329 --> 00:39:34,957
- [Patricia] Let her get some air!
- Wake up, Pris. Don't do this.

683
00:39:37,251 --> 00:39:38,544
It's there.

684
00:39:39,712 --> 00:39:42,047
It's been there for a while.
It's the size of a softball.

685
00:39:42,131 --> 00:39:43,257
Jesus.

686
00:39:44,091 --> 00:39:45,092
- It's grown.
- What?

687
00:39:45,175 --> 00:39:47,469
- What's happening to Mom?
- What's going on?

688
00:39:47,553 --> 00:39:49,847
- Dad! Dad, what's happening to Mom?
- It's okay.

689
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:53,517
Trent, why don't you two guys go play
somewhere else on the beach, okay? Okay?

690
00:39:53,601 --> 00:39:56,061
Mom's a little bit tired.
Would you do that for me, tiger?

691
00:39:56,145 --> 00:39:57,905
[Patricia] The first adult
is being affected.

692
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:59,106
[Guy] What if we cut it out?

693
00:39:59,189 --> 00:40:00,749
- [Trent] Dad!
- [Charles] Not possible.

694
00:40:00,774 --> 00:40:03,068
Actually, it is. But it's Guy's call.

695
00:40:03,152 --> 00:40:04,904
No! No, no, no! No!

696
00:40:04,987 --> 00:40:07,406
I don't wanna make this decision.
No. No, I...

697
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:10,784
I don't know what to do.

698
00:40:16,165 --> 00:40:17,708
- Do we have alcohol?
- Yes.

699
00:40:17,791 --> 00:40:19,293
Some bottles from the minibar.

700
00:40:19,376 --> 00:40:21,378
I cannot be held responsible.
You understand?

701
00:40:21,462 --> 00:40:22,462
Yes.

702
00:40:23,422 --> 00:40:26,091
Okay. Well, does anyone
have a needle and thread?

703
00:40:26,175 --> 00:40:28,969
- We have to sew this up.
- [Patricia] Yeah, yeah. Uh...

704
00:40:29,053 --> 00:40:31,305
Here. Here. Is this the right decision?

705
00:40:31,388 --> 00:40:33,783
- Maybe we should all talk about this.
- [Guy] I can't think.

706
00:40:33,807 --> 00:40:35,476
This tumor is going to kill her.

707
00:40:40,356 --> 00:40:44,443
Did you know that Jack Nicholson
did a film with Marlon Brando?

708
00:40:44,526 --> 00:40:45,527
Oh, no.

709
00:40:46,695 --> 00:40:47,863
What is he saying?

710
00:40:47,947 --> 00:40:50,282
- What was the name of that film?
- Charles, breathe.

711
00:40:50,366 --> 00:40:51,867
- [Jarin] Are you okay?
- Yes.

712
00:40:52,701 --> 00:40:55,287
- Will you let me do my job, please?
- Is he okay?

713
00:41:17,518 --> 00:41:18,519
[Jarin] Cut her again.

714
00:41:18,602 --> 00:41:21,063
We'll keep our hands in there
to keep the incision open.

715
00:41:21,146 --> 00:41:22,982
[Mid-Sized Sedan]
Guy, I can help, brother.

716
00:41:23,065 --> 00:41:24,733
No, I'll take care of her.

717
00:41:24,817 --> 00:41:26,377
Does anyone know the name of that film?

718
00:41:26,443 --> 00:41:30,614
It was with Jack Nicholson
and Marlon Brando.

719
00:41:31,573 --> 00:41:33,283
- Both.
- [Jarin] Try again, Doctor.

720
00:41:33,951 --> 00:41:37,997
Oblique incision on the side of the belly,
four to six inches. You can do this.

721
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:43,293
Put your fingers inside the incision.

722
00:41:43,377 --> 00:41:44,461
Okay.

723
00:41:44,545 --> 00:41:46,505
[Charles] Can you open it
a little wider, please?

724
00:41:48,048 --> 00:41:49,341
It's closing around my fingers.

725
00:41:49,425 --> 00:41:52,094
Keep pulling it apart. That's it.

726
00:41:52,886 --> 00:41:54,388
I'm lifting the tumor out.

727
00:41:55,514 --> 00:41:58,350
Wow! It's the size of a cantaloupe!

728
00:41:58,434 --> 00:41:59,435
Wait!

729
00:42:00,352 --> 00:42:02,104
It's attached to something.

730
00:42:02,896 --> 00:42:04,231
- Muscle tissue.
- [Charles] Okay.

731
00:42:04,314 --> 00:42:08,277
Could you hold the incision open
a little wider, if you would?

732
00:42:09,695 --> 00:42:10,863
I'm so sorry, Pris.

733
00:42:10,946 --> 00:42:13,574
[Charles]
Just cutting underneath the tumor.

734
00:42:15,159 --> 00:42:16,869
Okay. Got it.

735
00:42:29,548 --> 00:42:30,841
[Trent] Mom.

736
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:34,595
Prisca?

737
00:42:35,804 --> 00:42:37,014
Mom?

738
00:42:37,097 --> 00:42:38,515
[sobbing]

739
00:42:53,739 --> 00:42:54,823
It's okay.

740
00:42:55,991 --> 00:42:57,326
I just fainted.

741
00:42:59,328 --> 00:43:01,080
We took the tumor out.

742
00:43:01,663 --> 00:43:03,040
It was going to kill you.

743
00:43:04,708 --> 00:43:07,711
[Jarin] Your husband made a fast decision.

744
00:43:19,223 --> 00:43:21,475
Guy, I feel better.

745
00:43:41,829 --> 00:43:42,830
Damn!

746
00:43:45,207 --> 00:43:46,834
Come on, y'all, look at this!

747
00:43:49,044 --> 00:43:50,212
Hurry!

748
00:43:53,132 --> 00:43:54,299
Damn.

749
00:43:55,676 --> 00:43:57,010
Come on, y'all!

750
00:44:05,936 --> 00:44:07,688
Can we all agree I didn't do that?

751
00:44:08,689 --> 00:44:09,857
What happened to her?

752
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:11,900
[Prisca] The body has decomposed.

753
00:44:12,484 --> 00:44:14,778
- How quickly can that happen?
- [Charles] A long time.

754
00:44:14,862 --> 00:44:16,196
Mom knows this stuff.

755
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,532
I'm not a forensic pathologist,

756
00:44:18,615 --> 00:44:21,076
but from excavations for the museum,

757
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:24,371
I know that it varies
based on soil and temperature.

758
00:44:24,454 --> 00:44:27,374
My best guess, an exposed body,

759
00:44:27,457 --> 00:44:30,794
the flesh will be gone
in approximately seven years.

760
00:44:31,753 --> 00:44:33,714
And this happened in, what,
three hours?

761
00:44:33,797 --> 00:44:34,965
I know.

762
00:44:35,048 --> 00:44:38,635
And bones, we've found,
will disintegrate in 30 years more.

763
00:44:39,219 --> 00:44:40,679
[Mid-Sized Sedan]
What the hell, man?

764
00:44:40,762 --> 00:44:44,308
On this beach, less than 20 hours
after you die, you just return to dust.

765
00:44:45,642 --> 00:44:46,935
What exactly are we saying?

766
00:44:47,019 --> 00:44:49,062
Something is going on
with time on this beach.

767
00:44:49,688 --> 00:44:50,898
Time?

768
00:44:56,862 --> 00:44:58,113
You have wrinkles.

769
00:45:12,002 --> 00:45:13,670
I'm scared.

770
00:45:17,716 --> 00:45:23,180
It's best to focus on specifics
in the present in unsettling situations.

771
00:45:23,263 --> 00:45:25,766
- [Kara] Mm-hmm.
- Like breathing.

772
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:28,727
What's happening to us?

773
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:31,480
Are we sick, too?

774
00:45:31,563 --> 00:45:32,773
[Trent] No, I don't think so.

775
00:45:33,607 --> 00:45:34,983
I think we're just growing.

776
00:45:35,734 --> 00:45:37,778
[Prisca] Going by Trent and Maddox's ages

777
00:45:37,861 --> 00:45:39,696
and the time we spent on this beach,

778
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:44,618
half an hour is equivalent
to something like one year of our lives.

779
00:45:45,369 --> 00:45:48,413
This must be true for all of us,
we just don't see it on everyone.

780
00:45:49,122 --> 00:45:51,002
It's the first time
they wished they were Black.

781
00:45:51,083 --> 00:45:52,084
[Patricia] Mm-hmm.

782
00:45:52,167 --> 00:45:54,461
The kids are eating so much
because their mass is growing.

783
00:45:54,544 --> 00:45:58,507
They need to grow
an enormous amount of mass quickly.

784
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:00,676
We're staying roughly the same mass.

785
00:46:00,759 --> 00:46:02,594
Our cells are just aging.

786
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:04,554
I don't feel the same.

787
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:07,224
It's like my mind is changing, too.

788
00:46:08,183 --> 00:46:11,061
I'm getting many thoughts
at the same time.

789
00:46:12,229 --> 00:46:13,272
It's weird.

790
00:46:17,734 --> 00:46:20,279
I'm not as scared
about what's happening to us.

791
00:46:21,863 --> 00:46:23,383
[Prisca]
What about our hair and nails?

792
00:46:24,032 --> 00:46:26,368
Shouldn't they be growing
at an abnormal rate?

793
00:46:26,451 --> 00:46:28,537
Maybe it has to do with
the fact that the cells

794
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:30,622
in hair and nails are dead,

795
00:46:30,706 --> 00:46:32,958
and they aren't reacting
in the same way.

796
00:46:33,041 --> 00:46:36,586
[Mid-Sized Sedan]
On this beach, 60 minutes is two years.

797
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:39,965
We'll age almost 50 years in one day here.

798
00:46:40,841 --> 00:46:42,050
Almost a lifetime.

799
00:46:46,346 --> 00:46:48,765
I think it could be the rock
that surrounds this beach.

800
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:52,811
If our cells are being affected,

801
00:46:52,894 --> 00:46:55,647
speeding up in their processes,

802
00:46:56,815 --> 00:47:01,445
then us trying to leave
is like swimming to the surface too fast

803
00:47:01,528 --> 00:47:02,988
after being deep in the ocean.

804
00:47:03,071 --> 00:47:05,490
Our bodies can't reacclimate.

805
00:47:06,158 --> 00:47:08,660
That's why we go unconscious
when we try to leave.

806
00:47:10,912 --> 00:47:16,376
Maybe we could slowly
walk through the canyon,

807
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:18,712
take a step, stand still.

808
00:47:19,713 --> 00:47:22,382
Do it over eight to ten hours.

809
00:47:23,633 --> 00:47:25,010
Let our bodies acclimate.

810
00:47:27,554 --> 00:47:29,806
But, according to Prisca's timeline,

811
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:32,351
who would be willing to give up
20 years of their life trying?

812
00:47:32,434 --> 00:47:33,560
I'm sorry, this is nonsense.

813
00:47:33,643 --> 00:47:36,188
Let's not shut down everyone's experience.

814
00:47:37,647 --> 00:47:39,066
Wait. Where are the kids?

815
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:44,071
Trent!

816
00:47:44,613 --> 00:47:45,614
Kara!

817
00:47:46,198 --> 00:47:49,284
Answer us now! We need you here!

818
00:47:49,368 --> 00:47:50,577
There they are.

819
00:48:05,133 --> 00:48:07,761
- [Kara] Want some?
- No, I'm not hungry.

820
00:48:24,986 --> 00:48:26,279
Hey.

821
00:48:26,363 --> 00:48:27,781
Mom! Dad!

822
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:46,425
[Chrystal] Kara.

823
00:48:47,384 --> 00:48:50,137
- What did you do?
- We were just playing.

824
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:52,431
It's okay. I just got a little fat.

825
00:48:52,514 --> 00:48:53,682
Mom, you're better.

826
00:48:55,851 --> 00:48:56,971
- Maddox?
- [Chrystal scoffs]

827
00:48:58,186 --> 00:49:00,230
- Maddox?
- It's okay, Trent.

828
00:49:01,231 --> 00:49:03,900
Just let Mom and Dad figure this out.

829
00:49:06,736 --> 00:49:07,988
[Prisca] My God, Guy.

830
00:49:09,823 --> 00:49:11,116
It's okay, right, Mom?

831
00:49:11,908 --> 00:49:17,247
Jack Nicholson and Marlon Brando
were in a movie together.

832
00:49:18,123 --> 00:49:23,003
If she walked into the emergency room,
I'd say she's about five months pregnant.

833
00:49:23,086 --> 00:49:24,796
- What?
- What?

834
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,965
Just stay calm, Trent.

835
00:49:27,048 --> 00:49:30,552
[Jarin] She'll only be pregnant for about
20 minutes from the time of conception.

836
00:49:30,635 --> 00:49:33,680
Why do you keep looking at me
like you wanna steal my wallet?

837
00:49:33,763 --> 00:49:36,243
- Do you want me to punch you in the face?
- [Jarin] Calm down.

838
00:49:36,308 --> 00:49:38,908
- I have no idea what you're talking about.
- [Charles] All right.

839
00:49:38,935 --> 00:49:42,814
Let's just concentrate
on the issue at hand.

840
00:49:42,898 --> 00:49:44,191
Do you know about movies?

841
00:49:44,274 --> 00:49:46,526
Dad, Mom tells you to sit down
when you get like this.

842
00:49:46,610 --> 00:49:49,196
Hey. We need to get her help. Okay?

843
00:49:49,279 --> 00:49:51,781
- This cannot happen here.
- It's gotten bigger.

844
00:49:51,865 --> 00:49:54,451
- [Jarin] Kara? It's Kara, right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

845
00:49:54,534 --> 00:49:55,577
Lay down on a blanket.

846
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:58,747
[Patricia] It's gonna be okay. There's
a lot of people here that can help you.

847
00:49:58,830 --> 00:50:00,123
We're all like your family now.

848
00:50:00,207 --> 00:50:01,500
Oh, God.

849
00:50:01,583 --> 00:50:02,584
Ohh.

850
00:50:02,667 --> 00:50:04,586
[Guy] Our cells are aging very fast here.

851
00:50:04,669 --> 00:50:07,047
Something to do with the rocks
around the beach, we think.

852
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:08,757
[Jarin] Just lay down on the sand, okay?

853
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:12,052
[Guy] Whatever would have happened to us
is happening to us really fast, okay?

854
00:50:12,135 --> 00:50:13,136
[Trent] I know.

855
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:14,930
[Guy] What you did is how babies are made.

856
00:50:15,013 --> 00:50:17,853
[Trent] I know, but I thought you had
to do that ten times or something.

857
00:50:17,933 --> 00:50:20,536
- Take deep breaths. I'll breathe with you.
- Did I get that wrong?

858
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,896
- Baby, come on.
- [Guy] It can happen after only once.

859
00:50:24,105 --> 00:50:26,399
We didn't get a chance
to talk about all this.

860
00:50:26,483 --> 00:50:29,528
- Are Trent and I having a baby?
- Did I get it wrong?

861
00:50:29,611 --> 00:50:31,780
Only a couple of minutes left
if we're right.

862
00:50:32,322 --> 00:50:34,908
- Is that the baby? Mom.
- You got it. Okay.

863
00:50:34,991 --> 00:50:36,409
- Charles!
- Kara?

864
00:50:36,493 --> 00:50:38,411
[Charles] I need to think
about what to do.

865
00:50:38,495 --> 00:50:40,872
No! I need to help her.

866
00:50:40,956 --> 00:50:43,333
- Mom! I'm scared!
- It's okay.

867
00:50:43,416 --> 00:50:45,418
- Kara, wait. Stay with me.
- I'm here, baby.

868
00:50:45,502 --> 00:50:46,896
- Stay with me.
- Just take my hand.

869
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,421
Come on. Baby, can you hold her hand?

870
00:50:48,505 --> 00:50:50,799
I've decided I'm gonna marry her.

871
00:50:50,882 --> 00:50:54,094
And we are never gonna yell at each other
and we are never getting divorced!

872
00:50:54,177 --> 00:50:58,014
[Prisca] Trent, listen to me.
She's going to feel pain. Intense pain.

873
00:50:58,098 --> 00:51:00,058
Okay? Like she never felt before.

874
00:51:00,141 --> 00:51:03,770
But then it's going to pass. Okay?
It's going to pass.

875
00:51:03,853 --> 00:51:05,647
- [Patricia] You did it, girl!
- [Kara] Mom!

876
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:07,274
- All right.
- [Maddox] Chrystal.

877
00:51:07,357 --> 00:51:08,942
[Kara screaming]

878
00:51:09,025 --> 00:51:10,110
Chrystal!

879
00:51:11,945 --> 00:51:15,282
Hey, you blacked out.
You can't go that way.

880
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:18,952
Come on. You're okay now.
Come on.

881
00:51:19,035 --> 00:51:21,246
- Get up. Get up.
- [baby crying]

882
00:51:21,329 --> 00:51:22,581
- Come here.
- No.

883
00:51:23,498 --> 00:51:24,499
Look.

884
00:51:24,583 --> 00:51:25,792
[baby crying]

885
00:51:25,875 --> 00:51:27,335
[sobbing]

886
00:51:30,088 --> 00:51:31,923
You're okay. Come on. Come on.

887
00:51:32,549 --> 00:51:34,843
- Babies crying helps them breathe.
- [Maddox] It's here.

888
00:51:34,926 --> 00:51:36,469
We looked that up. Remember, Mom?

889
00:51:36,553 --> 00:51:37,887
[laughs]

890
00:51:37,971 --> 00:51:39,472
[baby continues crying]

891
00:51:40,557 --> 00:51:41,558
You see?

892
00:51:43,435 --> 00:51:45,020
[Kara grunting]

893
00:51:48,189 --> 00:51:50,233
[Patricia] We put him on the towel
to clean him up.

894
00:51:50,317 --> 00:51:54,237
[crying]
He looked around and closed his eyes.

895
00:51:54,321 --> 00:51:56,740
We had him on the towel for one minute.

896
00:51:57,324 --> 00:51:59,200
[Chrystal]
He died from lack of attention.

897
00:51:59,284 --> 00:52:02,245
[Mid-Sized Sedan] Things are moving
too fast here for a baby to survive.

898
00:52:03,163 --> 00:52:05,165
[Trent] No. No, you're lying.

899
00:52:05,248 --> 00:52:07,667
You're lying! You're all lying!
You're lying!

900
00:52:07,751 --> 00:52:08,752
Shut up, Trent.

901
00:52:08,835 --> 00:52:11,004
- Hey. Hey!
- You're lying!

902
00:52:11,087 --> 00:52:12,672
[screaming]

903
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:16,259
Maybe we should all talk
about what just happened.

904
00:52:19,429 --> 00:52:22,474
Charles, get us out of here!

905
00:52:23,141 --> 00:52:26,811
Get us out of here now!
You were supposed to protect us!

906
00:52:26,895 --> 00:52:28,980
You didn't protect us.

907
00:52:29,064 --> 00:52:30,565
Kara's hurt!

908
00:52:31,566 --> 00:52:34,986
I will make these decisions.
Just give me a second.

909
00:52:40,533 --> 00:52:43,328
I used to see you in our neighborhood.
Who are you?

910
00:52:45,246 --> 00:52:46,665
I'm Jarin!

911
00:52:48,917 --> 00:52:50,669
I don't know where you live.

912
00:52:53,963 --> 00:52:55,382
Don't condescend to me.

913
00:52:58,885 --> 00:53:00,553
Put some makeup on your face.

914
00:53:20,156 --> 00:53:22,200
I'm sorry about the baby.

915
00:53:24,452 --> 00:53:27,122
When I was your age,
I was in love with a man.

916
00:53:29,624 --> 00:53:31,042
His name was Giuseppe.

917
00:53:32,919 --> 00:53:35,338
He wasn't very handsome,
and I left him.

918
00:53:37,257 --> 00:53:39,092
We looked silly together, he and I.

919
00:53:49,519 --> 00:53:51,020
He had nothing to offer.

920
00:53:54,524 --> 00:53:56,943
For some reason,
I think about him a lot here.

921
00:54:08,037 --> 00:54:09,247
Leave me alone.

922
00:54:10,999 --> 00:54:15,128
[Patricia shrieking]

923
00:54:15,211 --> 00:54:16,921
[grunting]

924
00:54:21,718 --> 00:54:24,804
- No, Charles!
- Stop!

925
00:54:25,388 --> 00:54:26,598
Stop!

926
00:54:37,192 --> 00:54:39,235
- He's gone.
- [moaning]

927
00:54:39,319 --> 00:54:40,820
[Maddox] Oh, God.

928
00:54:40,904 --> 00:54:42,113
[sobs]

929
00:54:46,034 --> 00:54:48,036
[sobbing continues]

930
00:55:04,803 --> 00:55:07,347
I'm just going to take it.

931
00:55:12,101 --> 00:55:14,354
- Now...
- It's okay.

932
00:55:15,188 --> 00:55:16,856
Everything will be okay.

933
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,753
I'll find another beach
and I'll try to find help.

934
00:55:39,587 --> 00:55:40,922
She needs her medicine.

935
00:55:41,589 --> 00:55:43,341
We're lucky she hasn't had a seizure yet.

936
00:55:43,424 --> 00:55:45,927
It must be the beach.
Whatever it's doing to my body.

937
00:55:47,428 --> 00:55:49,848
Guy, I was on the swim team. I'll make it.

938
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:53,101
I'll make it.

939
00:56:00,191 --> 00:56:01,442
Watch him.

940
00:56:18,710 --> 00:56:20,378
[Guy] Maybe I could climb that rock.

941
00:56:22,088 --> 00:56:25,800
Maybe the effect, the blacking out,
doesn't happen if you go up.

942
00:56:26,759 --> 00:56:27,886
[Trent] You can't do it.

943
00:56:29,053 --> 00:56:31,139
- I'll do it.
- Yeah, he's strong. He can do it.

944
00:56:31,222 --> 00:56:32,807
- Yeah.
- No.

945
00:56:32,891 --> 00:56:34,726
I won't allow my son to do that.

946
00:56:34,809 --> 00:56:36,644
[Patricia] Prisca's right.
It's too dangerous.

947
00:56:36,728 --> 00:56:38,062
[Guy] It's a last resort.

948
00:56:38,938 --> 00:56:39,939
[Charles] Mum...

949
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:44,611
I do feel... overwhelmed.

950
00:56:45,612 --> 00:56:49,490
I'm managing, but no one must know.

951
00:56:52,243 --> 00:56:54,078
They'll try to stop me from working.

952
00:56:55,455 --> 00:56:56,623
What should I do?

953
00:56:58,082 --> 00:57:00,084
Mum, tell me what to do.

954
00:57:02,587 --> 00:57:05,548
[Guy] Prisca,
something's bothering me.

955
00:57:06,341 --> 00:57:08,760
Charles's family knew he had
some kind of mental disorder.

956
00:57:09,344 --> 00:57:11,346
Someone in each group was sick.

957
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:14,182
How did you first hear about this place?

958
00:57:14,265 --> 00:57:16,768
[Prisca] I don't know. I fell upon it.

959
00:57:16,851 --> 00:57:20,438
A random sweepstakes.
It came with a receipt at the pharmacy.

960
00:57:20,521 --> 00:57:23,358
I just followed it up online,
started getting emails.

961
00:57:23,441 --> 00:57:25,193
[Guy] They know
our medical condition.

962
00:57:25,276 --> 00:57:26,444
They chose us.

963
00:57:27,445 --> 00:57:30,114
They have our passports.
We could just disappear.

964
00:57:30,782 --> 00:57:33,242
They sent us a special car to the airport.

965
00:57:33,326 --> 00:57:34,327
A plane.

966
00:57:34,869 --> 00:57:38,122
They can make it look
like we never left the house.

967
00:57:53,304 --> 00:57:55,598
[Maddox] You were thinking
about leaving Dad.

968
00:57:57,558 --> 00:57:58,893
Weren't you?

969
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:06,442
Yes.

970
00:58:08,403 --> 00:58:10,530
I didn't want you two to suffer.

971
00:58:14,742 --> 00:58:16,244
Was there someone else?

972
00:58:27,797 --> 00:58:29,173
Did Dad know?

973
00:58:40,935 --> 00:58:42,061
Maddox.

974
00:58:43,312 --> 00:58:44,480
Please.

975
00:58:45,690 --> 00:58:50,111
I found out about this tumor
and I got scared.

976
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:54,532
I stare at the remains
of nameless people in glass cases

977
00:58:54,615 --> 00:58:57,744
and I kept thinking
I'm going to be one of those people.

978
00:58:57,827 --> 00:58:59,037
Does that make any sense?

979
00:59:00,997 --> 00:59:04,542
I feel different than I felt yesterday.

980
00:59:06,502 --> 00:59:10,339
What I did feels like an illusion,
I swear.

981
00:59:13,134 --> 00:59:14,677
You hate me now.

982
00:59:16,971 --> 00:59:19,515
I just need some time, Mom.

983
00:59:25,146 --> 00:59:27,148
We don't have that, baby.

984
00:59:29,901 --> 00:59:31,444
Look at you.

985
00:59:34,572 --> 00:59:36,199
You're an adult.

986
00:59:39,118 --> 00:59:41,287
Be strong for everyone.

987
00:59:46,125 --> 00:59:48,169
Connect to something bigger.

988
01:00:26,749 --> 01:00:28,501
[shrieking]

989
01:00:44,684 --> 01:00:46,686
[gasping]

990
01:00:47,979 --> 01:00:50,773
Here, here, hold on.
Lay him down, lay him down.

991
01:00:59,073 --> 01:01:01,075
[sobbing]

992
01:01:14,672 --> 01:01:16,716
He must have gone unconscious swimming.

993
01:01:19,302 --> 01:01:21,679
Brendon didn't do anything to that woman.

994
01:01:22,763 --> 01:01:24,640
We can't swim out, Prisca.

995
01:01:27,768 --> 01:01:29,770
[sobbing continues]

996
01:01:34,317 --> 01:01:36,235
We're not getting off this beach.

997
01:01:38,070 --> 01:01:43,284
We never had a prom,
or a graduation.

998
01:01:43,367 --> 01:01:45,786
There are so many memories we didn't have.

999
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:49,498
It's not fair.

1000
01:01:54,253 --> 01:01:56,088
He needs to rest now.

1001
01:02:31,958 --> 01:02:32,959
[Trent] Kara!

1002
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:36,671
Kara!

1003
01:02:38,589 --> 01:02:40,132
Wait. What if you get dizzy up there?

1004
01:02:40,216 --> 01:02:42,760
- You might black out.
- [Kara] Trent, we're in charge now.

1005
01:02:42,843 --> 01:02:44,303
My dad could hurt more people.

1006
01:02:44,387 --> 01:02:46,430
I have to get him off this beach.

1007
01:02:46,514 --> 01:02:48,307
Kara! Don't climb that.

1008
01:02:48,391 --> 01:02:51,060
Come down! We'll find another way.

1009
01:02:52,061 --> 01:02:53,396
[Prisca] No! Don't! Trent!

1010
01:02:53,479 --> 01:02:55,760
- [Maddox] Listen to Mom.
- [Trent] I have to go with her!

1011
01:02:55,815 --> 01:02:58,818
[Prisca] Kara, wait! Don't climb.
Let me get your mother.

1012
01:02:58,901 --> 01:03:01,028
- [Trent] Kara!
- [Guy] That's not the way.

1013
01:03:01,112 --> 01:03:03,656
She's panicked and desperate.
Talk to each other.

1014
01:03:03,739 --> 01:03:06,909
[Trent] Kara, you and I
should just stay together.

1015
01:03:06,993 --> 01:03:09,370
What if we spend this whole time
trying to get out of here

1016
01:03:09,453 --> 01:03:10,579
and we still don't make it?

1017
01:03:12,707 --> 01:03:14,583
It'll be too short if we don't try.

1018
01:03:14,667 --> 01:03:16,168
No, Kara, please!

1019
01:03:16,252 --> 01:03:18,296
Please just stay with me, please!

1020
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:25,928
[gasps]

1021
01:03:33,686 --> 01:03:36,230
If she makes it to the ledge,
she might have a chance.

1022
01:03:38,107 --> 01:03:39,692
Go to the ledge and rest!

1023
01:03:43,612 --> 01:03:44,697
Oh, shit.

1024
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:46,324
There has to be a way out.

1025
01:03:47,074 --> 01:03:49,827
It's a mathematical certainty.
There must be a way out.

1026
01:03:54,332 --> 01:03:55,833
[grunting]

1027
01:04:01,297 --> 01:04:03,007
[Trent] No. Why is she stopping?

1028
01:04:03,090 --> 01:04:04,216
No.

1029
01:04:05,843 --> 01:04:06,886
No, Kara.

1030
01:04:06,969 --> 01:04:08,220
Kara, wake up!

1031
01:04:08,304 --> 01:04:11,265
Kara, wake up! Wake up!

1032
01:04:14,643 --> 01:04:15,978
Oh!

1033
01:04:31,327 --> 01:04:33,329
[sobbing]

1034
01:04:45,174 --> 01:04:47,176
[continues sobbing]

1035
01:04:55,601 --> 01:04:56,602
Kara?

1036
01:05:02,775 --> 01:05:03,776
Daddy...

1037
01:05:03,859 --> 01:05:05,861
[sobbing]

1038
01:05:23,212 --> 01:05:24,922
Let's all stay together.

1039
01:05:25,631 --> 01:05:27,800
Nobody in this family goes alone anywhere.

1040
01:05:30,761 --> 01:05:34,849
[Patricia] I think I figured it out.
I'm using these to swim out.

1041
01:05:39,061 --> 01:05:40,521
I have a sister.

1042
01:05:41,147 --> 01:05:43,983
She's a therapist, too.
I need to get to my sister.

1043
01:05:44,608 --> 01:05:46,777
We never talk.
We had a fight a long time ago.

1044
01:05:46,861 --> 01:05:50,156
She's older, but now I am.

1045
01:05:51,407 --> 01:05:53,868
The fighting seems ridiculous now.

1046
01:05:59,707 --> 01:06:00,708
[Guy] Patricia.

1047
01:06:01,292 --> 01:06:02,293
Patricia.

1048
01:06:03,794 --> 01:06:05,087
- [Patricia choking]
- No.

1049
01:06:06,422 --> 01:06:08,048
[Maddox] What's happening to her?

1050
01:06:08,132 --> 01:06:09,925
She was fine. What's happening?

1051
01:06:10,009 --> 01:06:12,303
[Maddox] She keeps stopping
and starting.

1052
01:06:16,849 --> 01:06:18,225
Dad, do something.

1053
01:06:31,155 --> 01:06:32,156
No.

1054
01:06:54,011 --> 01:06:56,013
[crying softly]

1055
01:07:07,942 --> 01:07:09,193
Oh, no.

1056
01:07:11,403 --> 01:07:12,613
[Chrystal] Kara?

1057
01:07:14,865 --> 01:07:17,326
Kara, where are you?

1058
01:07:21,038 --> 01:07:24,124
Somebody's done this to us, Kara.

1059
01:07:27,086 --> 01:07:29,547
I can't protect you anymore.

1060
01:07:30,381 --> 01:07:32,216
Kara!

1061
01:07:42,977 --> 01:07:45,271
[Trent] No, you don't know.
Jarin went in a different way.

1062
01:07:45,354 --> 01:07:47,606
He went...
And I'm a better swimmer than he is.

1063
01:07:47,690 --> 01:07:50,025
He's older than me.
I could probably swim left...

1064
01:07:50,109 --> 01:07:52,778
[Guy] Trent, stop it. No. No.

1065
01:07:52,861 --> 01:07:55,048
- No, you're not a better swimmer.
- [Trent] Let me try.

1066
01:07:55,072 --> 01:07:57,392
- You're not even gonna let me try.
- [Guy] Listen. Listen.

1067
01:07:57,449 --> 01:07:58,450
Listen.

1068
01:08:02,913 --> 01:08:04,415
[sound fades out]

1069
01:08:12,339 --> 01:08:15,277
- [Trent]...then I can get on the rock.
- [Maddox] We're not gonna let you.

1070
01:08:15,301 --> 01:08:16,885
Stop. It won't work.

1071
01:08:16,969 --> 01:08:19,388
[Trent] I don't wanna give up.
I really don't wanna give up.

1072
01:08:19,471 --> 01:08:21,533
- [Maddox] We're not giving up.
- If you let me try...

1073
01:08:21,557 --> 01:08:23,559
[arguing continues indistinctly]

1074
01:08:39,408 --> 01:08:40,492
[Chrystal] My back.

1075
01:08:41,076 --> 01:08:42,911
I need my calcium.

1076
01:08:42,995 --> 01:08:44,079
[Prisca] Chrystal?

1077
01:08:44,788 --> 01:08:46,749
Chrystal, stay with us.

1078
01:08:47,291 --> 01:08:48,792
[Chrystal] Don't look at me.

1079
01:09:06,894 --> 01:09:10,022
Prisca, I have to tell you something.

1080
01:09:15,569 --> 01:09:17,655
I saw your text messages one day.

1081
01:09:22,951 --> 01:09:24,578
He says romantic things.

1082
01:09:31,460 --> 01:09:32,753
[loudly] I'm sorry.

1083
01:09:37,174 --> 01:09:41,220
I don't know who I would have been
okay with. But with that guy?

1084
01:09:44,890 --> 01:09:48,352
He's a joke, he's a pretend person.

1085
01:09:49,186 --> 01:09:51,522
You deserve someone
so much better than that.

1086
01:09:54,525 --> 01:09:56,318
I should have said something
when I saw it.

1087
01:09:56,402 --> 01:09:59,071
I hide from everything.
I'm a fucking coward.

1088
01:09:59,154 --> 01:10:02,157
This was no one's responsibility but me.

1089
01:10:03,075 --> 01:10:05,869
Your anger should be
aimed at me, just me.

1090
01:10:13,961 --> 01:10:17,881
There's no place I want to be
but with you.

1091
01:10:20,259 --> 01:10:21,677
Do you believe me?

1092
01:10:24,263 --> 01:10:25,889
I want to be here...

1093
01:10:30,310 --> 01:10:31,729
right now.

1094
01:10:52,499 --> 01:10:53,834
[Maddox] It's notebooks.

1095
01:10:58,255 --> 01:11:01,925
Well, maybe we can use some
of the empty pages for the fire,

1096
01:11:02,009 --> 01:11:03,510
keep Mom and Dad warm.

1097
01:11:08,098 --> 01:11:10,517
Whoever it was wanted
to be a science-fiction writer.

1098
01:11:10,601 --> 01:11:12,019
It's full of story ideas.

1099
01:11:13,645 --> 01:11:16,774
"Birds that can make you black out
when they scream,

1100
01:11:16,857 --> 01:11:20,277
fly too close to an Emirates
commercial plane one day."

1101
01:11:21,779 --> 01:11:24,573
He realized he was never getting off
this beach.

1102
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:28,952
He was trying to figure out
what's going on.

1103
01:11:32,790 --> 01:11:35,959
"Magnetism of this exact spot on the Earth

1104
01:11:36,043 --> 01:11:37,961
with the rocks on this beach,

1105
01:11:38,045 --> 01:11:41,173
submerged beneath the ocean
for millions of years,

1106
01:11:41,256 --> 01:11:43,300
deposited with special minerals,

1107
01:11:43,383 --> 01:11:46,762
are causing our cells
to age at a rapid rate.

1108
01:11:47,304 --> 01:11:49,515
Are there other places like this?

1109
01:11:50,557 --> 01:11:52,059
Who found this place?"

1110
01:11:53,393 --> 01:11:57,147
[Trent] Maybe we can make a metal tube
that we can get in

1111
01:11:57,231 --> 01:11:59,066

01:30:17,580 --> 01:30:19,206
Observations complete.

1276
01:30:19,999 --> 01:30:22,251

[machines beeping, whirring]

1279
01:31:41,288 --> 01:31:43,708
[Sidney] All rooms for this trial
have been cleared.

1280
01:31:43,791 --> 01:31:46,335
Uh, home computer devices
have been wiped.

1281
01:31:46,419 --> 01:31:48,754
Three home computers
still waiting to be scrubbed.

1282
01:31:56,887 --> 01:31:58,889
Hello. Uh...

1283
01:31:59,598 --> 01:32:03,144
a moment of silence
for the members of Trial 73.

1284
01:32:11,902 --> 01:32:12,945
Thank you.

1285
01:32:13,029 --> 01:32:14,405
[sighs deeply]

1286
01:32:15,322 --> 01:32:18,367
Um... I'll try not to be dramatic.

1287
01:32:21,162 --> 01:32:23,080
Because of this beach,

1288
01:32:24,123 --> 01:32:27,460
we have been able to save
hundreds of thousands of lives

1289
01:32:27,543 --> 01:32:28,836
with new medicines.

1290
01:32:29,712 --> 01:32:32,631
Before we're done, it will be millions.

1291
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:39,305
As you know,
we do trials and fail constantly.

1292
01:32:42,016 --> 01:32:43,768
But not today.

1293
01:32:44,935 --> 01:32:46,103
Tell them, Sidney.

1294
01:32:49,982 --> 01:32:54,862
One of this cohort
was a woman with the epileptic seizures.

1295
01:32:55,613 --> 01:32:57,156
Her name was Patricia Carmichael.

1296
01:32:57,239 --> 01:32:59,992
She suffered debilitating seizures
her whole life.

1297
01:33:00,076 --> 01:33:01,577
Nothing could help her.

1298
01:33:02,286 --> 01:33:06,457
The medicine we gave her when she arrived
turned out to be the exact mixture.

1299
01:33:07,374 --> 01:33:10,544
She didn't have a seizure
for 8 hours and 17 minutes.

1300
01:33:10,628 --> 01:33:12,213
[excited murmuring]

1301
01:33:12,296 --> 01:33:14,423
Sixteen and a half years.

1302
01:33:15,466 --> 01:33:17,760
We cured her of her epilepsy.

1303
01:33:18,344 --> 01:33:20,387
We'll now fast-track trials,

1304
01:33:20,471 --> 01:33:23,849
make that medicine
and share it with the whole world.

1305
01:33:24,475 --> 01:33:26,393
Every single person that needs it.

1306
01:33:31,357 --> 01:33:34,235
Nature made that beach exist for a reason.

1307
01:33:34,819 --> 01:33:37,738
Warren and Warren was meant to find it
on their research expedition.

1308
01:33:37,822 --> 01:33:42,159
We were meant to test medicines
in one day, instead of a lifetime.

1309
01:33:43,369 --> 01:33:46,122
Lots more work to be done, everyone.

1310
01:33:46,831 --> 01:33:50,501
Let's do what nature wanted us to do.

1311
01:33:50,584 --> 01:33:52,419
[clapping]

1312
01:33:58,467 --> 01:34:00,845
Mr. and Mrs. Brody will arrive
at 11:00 a.m.

1313
01:34:00,928 --> 01:34:02,847
with six non-targeted guests.

1314
01:34:02,930 --> 01:34:05,516
Joseph Brody has early-onset Parkinson's.

1315
01:34:06,684 --> 01:34:08,561
Florence Brody will be accompanying him.

1316
01:34:08,644 --> 01:34:10,980
I'm gonna be a broken record
about this, Nils.

1317
01:34:11,063 --> 01:34:13,566
We should separate
the pure medical subjects

1318
01:34:13,649 --> 01:34:15,317
from the mental illness subjects.

1319
01:34:15,401 --> 01:34:18,529
Our violent schizophrenic patient cost us
the data on our blood clot patient.

1320
01:34:18,612 --> 01:34:21,073
Sidney, I doubt we'll alter protocol
at this point,

1321
01:34:21,157 --> 01:34:25,578
but put it in a form
and submit it to Warren and Warren again.

How are you?

1324
01:34:53,647 --> 01:34:56,483
Those kids went home.
They don't matter.

1325
01:34:56,567 --> 01:34:58,569
I tell you which kids you can play with.

1326
01:34:58,652 --> 01:35:00,237
You have to trust me

1327
01:35:00,321 --> 01:35:03,282
and don't ask questions. Okay?

1328
01:35:04,366 --> 01:35:06,410
- Okay.
- Good.

1329
01:35:07,244 --> 01:35:08,787
Now, those kids are fine.

1330
01:35:08,871 --> 01:35:10,748
See, you can play with them.

1331
01:35:11,665 --> 01:35:13,250
- Okay.
- Good.

1332
01:35:30,935 --> 01:35:32,561
You're a police officer.

1333
01:35:35,397 --> 01:35:36,398
Yeah.

1334
01:35:55,501 --> 01:35:57,753
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Brody.

1335
01:35:57,836 --> 01:36:01,006
Welcome to our version of paradise.

1336
01:36:01,924 --> 01:36:03,342
Thank you.

1337
01:36:04,718 --> 01:36:06,637
- It's lovely.
- Thank you.

1338
01:36:07,263 --> 01:36:08,597
This is Madrid.

From your food and beverage preferences
that you selected,

we've made you cocktails to welcome you.

[glass shatters]

1342
01:36:16,522 --> 01:36:19,024
- [Mr. Brody] Sorry.
- [Madrid] No worries, Mr. and Mrs. Brody.

1343
01:36:19,108 --> 01:36:20,901
We'll just make a new set.

1344
01:36:20,985 --> 01:36:22,486
It'll only take a few moments.

1345
01:36:22,569 --> 01:36:24,446
[Trent] I wouldn't take
anything they give you.

1346
01:36:24,530 --> 01:36:26,198
They left us all to die.

1347
01:36:28,993 --> 01:36:31,245
My name is Trent Capa.

1348
01:36:31,912 --> 01:36:33,497
I'm Maddox Capa.

1349

[Greg] All three are missing persons?

1350

Sending you the rest of the names now.

are Guy and Prisca Capa.</i>

Philadelphia, USA.</i>

who was a nurse.</i>

Listen, we have to get security.
What's happening?

1356
01:37:15,205 --> 01:37:16,623
Are you listening to me?

Gentlemen. Hey, hey, hey!

Gentlemen, we have a problem.
We need your assistance immediately.

1360

Two of our guests need your attention.

[Greg] They've arrested everybody here.

Subpoenas are being served at Warren
and Warren's headquarters this week.

Let's get them to the airport.

1370
01:40:32,861 --> 01:40:35,364
Your aunt will be waiting for you
when you land.

1371
01:40:35,447 --> 01:40:36,907
How's she handling things?

1372
01:40:37,908 --> 01:40:40,619
How would you feel
if a 50-year-old man called and told you

1373
01:40:40,702 --> 01:40:42,621
he was your six-year-old nephew?

1374
