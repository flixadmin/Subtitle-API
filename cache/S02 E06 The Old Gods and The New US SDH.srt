6
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,491
I'VE TAKEN YOUR CASTLE.

7
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:41,411
- THEON?
- IT'S PRINCE THEON NOW.

8
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,913
GET UP.
YOU HAVE TO GET DRESSED.

9
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,416
I'VE TAKEN WINTERFELL.

10
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:49,294
I TOOK IT.
I'M OCCUPYING IT.

11
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:52,338
I SENT MEN OVER THE WALLS
WITH GRAPPLING CLAWS AND ROPES.

12
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:55,633
- WHY?
- TO TAKE THE CASTLE.

13
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:59,929
- YOU WENT WITH ROBB.
- AND HE SENT ME BACK TO PYKE.

14
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:03,683
I'M A GREYJOY.
I CAN'T FIGHT FOR ROBB
AND MY FATHER BOTH.

15
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,896
- WHERE'S HODOR?
- I DON'T KNOW.

16
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,189
FIND THE HALFWIT.

17
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:13,151
MY MEN ARE BRINGING YOUR PEOPLE
TOGETHER IN THE COURTYARD.

18
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:14,569
WHY?

19
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:16,738
SO YOU AND I CAN
GO DOWN AND TELL THEM

20
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:19,574
- HOW YOU'VE YIELDED
WINTERFELL TO ME.
- I WON'T.

21
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:21,618
YES, YOU WILL.

22
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:24,704
I WON'T.
I'LL NEVER YIELD.

23
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:26,956
WE'LL FIGHT YOU
AND THROW YOU OUT.

24
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,042
( sighs )

25
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,339
THE CASTLE IS MINE,

26
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:36,674
BUT THESE PEOPLE
ARE STILL YOURS.

27
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:39,052
YOU'LL YIELD
TO KEEP THEM SAFE,

28
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:41,346
TO KEEP THEM ALIVE.

29
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:44,349
THAT'S WHAT A GOOD
LORD WOULD DO.

30
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:49,896
THINK CAREFULLY ABOUT
WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY.

31
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:55,068
THEON.

32
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:57,028
DID YOU HATE US
THE WHOLE TIME?

33
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,911
-<i> ( thunder rumbles )</i>
<i>- ( horse whinnies )</i>

34
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:06,955
I'VE YIELDED
WINTERFELL TO THEON.

35
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:09,123
LOUDER.

36
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,833
SAY PRINCE THEON.

37
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:14,003
I'VE YIELDED WINTERFELL
TO PRINCE THEON.

38
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,755
YOU ALL KNOW ME.

39
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:18,466
AYE, WE KNOW YOU FOR
A STEAMING SACK OF SHIT.

40
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:20,218
FARLEN, YOU BE SILENT.

41
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:23,429
LISTEN TO YOUR
LITTLE LORD, FARLEN.

42
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,181
HE HAS MORE SENSE
THAN YOU DO.

43
00:04:25,264 --> 00:04:27,016
ALL OF YOU SHOULD DO
AS HE COMMANDS.

44
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,687
MY FATHER HAS DONNED
THE ANCIENT CROWN OF
SALT AND ROCK

45
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:34,315
AND DECLARED HIMSELF
KING OF THE IRON ISLANDS.

46
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,485
HE CLAIMS THE NORTH AS WELL
BY RIGHT OF CONQUEST.

47
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:39,404
YOU ARE ALL HIS SUBJECTS.

48
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:41,990
BUGGER THAT.
I SERVE THE STARKS.

49
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:45,493
- IF YOU THINK YOU CAN
HOLD THE NORTH WITH THIS--
- SHUT UP!

50
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:48,997
Theon:
<i>IF YOU SERVE ME AS LOYALLY</i>
<i>AS YOU SERVED NED STARK,</i>

51
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,125
<i>I WILL BE AS GOOD TO YOU</i>
<i>AS HE EVER WAS.</i>

52
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,377
BETRAY ME, AND YOU WILL
WISH YOU HADN'T.

53
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,045
( crowd murmuring )

54
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:59,257
MAESTER LUWIN,
SEND A RAVEN TO PYKE

55
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,051
INFORMING MY FATHER
OF MY VICTORY HERE

56
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,721
AND ONE TO DEEPWOOD MOTTE
TO MY SISTER.

57
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:09,017
INFORM HER THAT SHE'S
TO BRING 500 MEN
TO WINTERFELL.

58
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,228
<i>( crowd murmuring )</i>

59
00:05:12,311 --> 00:05:14,439
YOU ARE A MAESTER
OF THE CITADEL

60
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:17,817
SWORN TO SERVE THE LORD
OF WINTERFELL, ARE YOU NOT?

61
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,235
I AM.

62
00:05:19,318 --> 00:05:21,154
I AM THE LORD
OF WINTERFELL

63
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:23,031
AS BRAN JUST INFORMED YOU.

64
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,951
SEND THE RAVENS.

65
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,205
MY LORD.

66
00:05:32,331 --> 00:05:35,460
MY LORD GREYJOY.

67
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:38,921
I SEE YOU'VE FINALLY LEARNED
HOW TO ADDRESS YOUR BETTERS.

68
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:41,215
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

69
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,468
I WAS BROUGHT HERE
A CAPTIVE.

70
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,762
YOU WERE HERE THE DAY
I WAS TAKEN.

71
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:49,849
I'M THE ONE WHO TOOK YOU.
WHAT OF IT?

72
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:52,435
LET ME SERVE YOU.

73
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:55,188
Theon:
<i>SERVE ME HOW?</i>

74
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:57,774
I NEED FIGHTERS,
NOT KITCHEN SLUTS.

75
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,610
IT WAS ROBB STARK WHO
PUT ME IN THE KITCHENS.

76
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:03,446
PUT A SPEAR
IN MY HAND AGAIN.

77
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,573
SO YOU CAN BURY IT
IN MY NECK?

78
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:07,200
DO YOU TAKE ME
FOR A FOOL?

79
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:08,493
GET UP.

80
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:11,662
STEP ASIDE.

81
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,915
WHY?

82
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:17,460
IT'S YOUR DREAM,
LITTLE LORD.

83
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:20,546
THE OCEAN HAS COME
TO SWALLOW THIS PLACE.

84
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,466
I AIN'T LETTING IT
DROWN ME.

85
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:26,302
- AND IN A FEW DAYS' TIME--
- Rodrik:<i> GREYJOY!</i>

86
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:33,309
Woman:
<i>WHAT HAVE THEY</i>
<i>DONE TO HIM?</i>

87
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:36,312
WE CAUGHT THIS ONE
ON THIS WAY BACK FROM
TORRHEN'S SQUARE.

88
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:39,482
TOOK OUT TWO OF OURS
BEFORE I GOT HIS SWORD.

89
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:42,735
SER RODRIK,
IT GRIEVES ME THAT
WE MEET AS FOES.

90
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:46,697
IT GRIEVES ME
YOU'VE LESS HONOR
THAN A BACK ALLEY WHORE.

91
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:50,243
YOU WERE RAISED HERE
UNDER THIS ROOF.

92
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:52,954
- THESE PEOPLE ARE YOUR PEOPLE.
- THEY ARE NOT MY PEOPLE.

93
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:55,081
KING ROBB THOUGHT OF YOU
AS A BROTHER.

94
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:58,209
MY BROTHERS ARE DEAD.

95
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:00,878
THEY DIED FIGHTING
STARK MEN, MEN LIKE YOU.

96
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:04,340
AYE, THEY DIED FIGHTING
A WAR YOUR FATHER STARTED.

97
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:06,717
LORD STARK RAISED YOU
AMONG HIS OWN SONS.

98
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,928
AMONG THEM,
BUT NOT ONE OF THEM.

99
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:11,722
I WAS HIS HOSTAGE
TAKEN FROM MY HOME.

100
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:13,474
IF HE WERE ALIVE
TO SEE THIS--

101
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,268
HE'S NOT.
HE'S DEAD.

102
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:17,436
THE SEVEN KINGDOMS
ARE AT WAR.

103
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,689
AND WINTERFELL IS MINE.

104
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:22,441
I SHOULD HAVE PUT
A SWORD IN YOUR BELLY

105
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,026
INSTEAD OF
IN YOUR HAND.

106
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,280
YOU'VE SERVED THIS HOUSE
FAITHFULLY, OLD MAN.

107
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:29,240
BUT KEEP TALKING
AND I'LL--

108
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:31,159
( grunts )

109
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:34,036
TAKE HIM TO THE CELLS.
LOCK HIM UP--

110
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,830
MY PRINCE,

111
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:38,374
YOU CANNOT LET THAT STAND.
HE MUST PAY.

112
00:07:38,457 --> 00:07:40,251
I'LL LOCK HIM IN A CELL
UNTIL HE ROTS--

113
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:43,546
NO, HE HAS TO PAY
THE IRON PRICE.

114
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:46,465
THEY'LL NEVER RESPECT
YOU WHILE HE LIVES.

115
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,564
<i>( thunder rumbles )</i>

116
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,320
SER RODRIK,

117
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:09,071
I SENTENCE YOU TO DEATH.

118
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,407
NO! YOU SAID NO HARM
WOULD COME TO THEM
IF I YIELDED.

119
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:13,701
THE OLD MAN COULDN'T
KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT.

120
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:16,579
I URGE YOU NOT TO MAKE
A HASTY DECISION.

121
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:19,582
HE DISRESPECTED ME
IN FRONT OF MY MEN.

122
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,083
THAT WAS HIS DECISION,
NOT MINE.

123
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,419
HE IS WORTH MORE
TO YOU ALIVE THAN DEAD.

124
00:08:23,502 --> 00:08:26,505
THE STARKS WILL PAY.

125
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:29,300
PLEASE, THEON,

126
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:31,427
THINK WHAT YOU DO.

127
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,606
YOU'LL ADDRESS ME
AS PRINCE THEON

128
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,566
OR YOU'LL BE NEXT.

129
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,652
COME.

130
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:49,987
NO!

131
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:53,241
- NO!
- Bran:<i> THEON!</i>

132
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,035
PLEASE!

133
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:57,954
SER RODRIK!

134
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,873
HE WHO PASSES THE SENTENCE
SHOULD SWING THE SWORD.

135
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,709
- Bran:<i> I'M BEGGING YOU!</i>
<i>- COWARD.</i>

136
00:09:06,545 --> 00:09:09,465
STOP! STOP RIGHT NOW!

137
00:09:09,548 --> 00:09:11,592
YOU DON'T GIVE
COMMANDS ANYMORE,
LITTLE LORD.

138
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:14,220
- PLEASE, STOP THIS.
PLEASE STOP HIM.
- Rodrik:<i> HUSH NOW, CHILD.</i>

139
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:17,306
I'M OFF TO SEE YOUR FATHER.

140
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:22,270
Bran:
YOU SAID NO HARM
WOULD COME!

141
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:25,147
<i>YOU SAID NO HARM WOULD COME.</i>
<i>THEON, PLEASE.</i>

142
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,817
ANY LAST WORDS, OLD MAN?

143
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,820
GODS HELP YOU,
THEON GREYJOY.

144
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,905
NOW YOU ARE TRULY LOST.

145
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,324
Bran:
<i>THEON, PLEASE, DON'T.</i>

146
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,411
- Rickon:<i> DO SOMETHING.</i>
<i>- Bran: I'LL DO ANYTHING.</i>
<i>PLEASE!</i>

147
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:40,288
Rickon:
<i>NO, PLEASE, STOP IT!</i>

148
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:41,747
- ( grunts )
- ( screams )

149
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:54,719
-<i> ( Bran wailing )</i>
<i>- ( thunder rumbling )</i>

150
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,514
( panting )

151
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:05,646
( wind howling )

152
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:14,572
Jon:
GHOST, STAY WITH US.

153
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,615
GHOST!

154
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,409
THERE GOES YOUR PET.

155
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:20,036
Jon:
<i>HE'S NOT A PET.</i>

156
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,580
Qhorin:
<i>YOU'RE RIGHT,</i>
<i>HE'S NOT.</i>

157
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:25,082
YOU CAN'T TAME
A WILD THING.

158
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,043
YOU CAN'T TRUST
A WILD THING.

159
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:30,129
- GHOST IS DIFFERENT.
- SO YOU THINK.

160
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:32,506
WILD CREATURES
HAVE THEIR OWN RULES,

161
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,717
THEIR OWN REASONS.

162
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,677
AND YOU'LL NEVER
KNOW THEM.

163
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:40,306
NOW THE WILDLINGS
WE'RE LOOKING FOR

164
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:42,808
SLEEP DURING THE DAY
AND HUNT AT NIGHT.

165
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:47,021
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU COULDN'T KNOW
WILD THINGS.

166
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:48,981
I SAID YOU CAN'T.

167
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:52,151
THEY FIND A NICE CAVE
TO HIDE IN WHILE
THE SUN'S UP

168
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:54,070
AND DO THEIR KILLING
WHEN IT'S DARK.

169
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:57,031
- WE COULD DO THE SAME.
- NO, WE COULDN'T.

170
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:59,492
THIS IS THEIR COUNTRY.

171
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:02,411
THEY KNOW WHERE TO WALK,
WHERE NOT TO WALK.

172
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,372
I'VE LOST GOOD MEN
WHO FELL INTO A CREVASSE

173
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:06,540
THEY DIDN'T SEE
TILL THEY WERE IN IT.

174
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,294
MY FATHER ALWAYS SAID
I'M OF THE NORTH.

175
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,171
( chuckles )

176
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:15,091
- I WASN'T JOKING.
- LOOK AROUND, BOY.

177
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:18,302
THIS LOOK LIKE
HOME TO YOU?

178
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:21,680
YOU START THINKING
YOU KNOW THIS PLACE,
IT'LL KILL YOU.

179
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:24,975
YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

180
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:27,311
NO, YOU DON'T.

181
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,438
WE'RE AT WAR.

182
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,357
WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN AT WAR.

183
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,692
IT'S NEVER GOING TO END
'CAUSE WE'RE NOT FIGHTING
AN ENEMY.

184
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:37,279
WE'RE FIGHTING THE NORTH
AND IT'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

185
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:40,282
THE WATCH HAS GIVEN
YOU A GREAT GIFT.

186
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,868
YOU ONLY HAVE ONE THING
TO GIVE IN RETURN--

187
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,412
YOUR LIFE.

188
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:45,746
I'LL GLADLY GIVE MY LIFE.

189
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,124
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO BE GLAD ABOUT IT.

190
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,126
I WANT YOU TO CURSE
AND FIGHT

191
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,503
UNTIL YOUR HEART'S
DONE PUMPING.

192
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:54,922
AND KNOW THIS, BOY--

193
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:58,676
YOUR DEATH WILL BE A GIFT
FOR THEM SOUTH OF THE WALL.

194
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,970
THEY'LL NEVER KNOW
WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

195
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,721
THEY'LL NEVER KNOW
HOW YOU DIED.

196
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,849
THEY WON'T EVEN
KNOW YOUR DAMN NAME,

197
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:07,768
BUT THEY'LL BE ALIVE BECAUSE
SOME NAMELESS BASTARD

198
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:11,480
NORTH OF THE WALL
GAVE HIS LIFE FOR THEIRS.

199
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,525
NOW, DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

200
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:16,318
I DO.

201
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,821
YOU'RE EVEN DUMBER
THAN YOU LOOK.

202
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:21,615
IT'S JUST WORDS, BOY,

203
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,617
TO KEEP US A LITTLE
WARMER IN THE NIGHT,

204
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:27,079
MAKE US FEEL LIKE
WE'VE GOT A PURPOSE.

205
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,331
( laughs )
COME ON.

206
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:33,377
WE'VE GOT TO FIND THESE
GOAT FUCKERS BEFORE NIGHT
FALLS AND THEY FIND US.

207
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,683
- CAN YOU READ?
- MY LORD?

208
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:50,644
CAN YOU READ?

209
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:57,485
THIS LETTER DETAILING
OUR INFANTRY MOVEMENTS

210
00:12:57,568 --> 00:13:00,362
WAS MEANT FOR LORD DAMON
OF HOUSE MARBRAND.

211
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:04,241
IT WAS SENT TO LORD MARLYN
OF HOUSE DORMAND.

212
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,202
MY APOLOGIES, MY LORD.
I MUST HAVE--

213
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:09,788
GIRL, FETCH ME
THE "HISTORY OF THE GREATER
AND THE LESSER HOUSES."

214
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:12,500
IT'S THE ONE ON THE--

215
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:17,630
MY CUPBEARER CAN READ
BETTER THAN YOU.

216
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:30,100
TO WHOM DOES
HOUSE DORMAND
OWE ALLEGIANCE?

217
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,396
MY LORD, I--

218
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,233
TO THE STARKS
OF WINTERFELL!

219
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:41,487
WHO HAVE 20,000 MEN
AND MY SON!

220
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,990
I JUDGED YOU MIGHT BE
GOOD FOR SOMETHING MORE

221
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,743
THAN BRUTALIZING PEASANTS.

222
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:51,080
I SEE I OVERESTIMATED YOU.

223
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:54,416
<i>IF YOU EVER PUT MY SON'S</i>
<i>LIFE AT RISK AGAIN, I'LL...</i>

224
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,753
LEAVE US.

225
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:06,929
PUT THE BOOK AWAY, GIRL.

226
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,765
<i>( door opens )</i>

227
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:13,811
<i>( door closes )</i>

228
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:17,398
MAYBE YOU SHOULD DEVISE
OUR NEXT BATTLE PLAN WHILE
YOU'RE ABOUT IT.

229
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:19,441
<i>( knocking )</i>

230
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,944
<i>( door opens )</i>

231
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,738
LORD PETYR BAELISH.

232
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,407
MMM.

233
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,492
GIVE US THE ROOM.

234
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,586
CLEAR ALL THIS.

235
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:45,092
- LORD TYWIN.
- BAELISH.

236
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:55,352
- WINE?
- THANK YOU.

237
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,940
WHAT NEWS
FROM THE CAPITAL?

238
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:03,444
I TRAVELLED HERE DIRECTLY
FROM RENLY BARATHEON'S CAMP.

239
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:05,696
AH, THE LATE KING RENLY.

240
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:07,948
RATHER A SHORT REIGN.

241
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:10,075
MURDERED BY A WOMAN,
I HEAR.

242
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,910
SO THEY SAY.

243
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:17,249
THERE HAS BEEN TALK
OF OTHER FORCES AT WORK,

244
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,627
DARK FORCES.

245
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,004
HERE.

246
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,300
( scoffs )
MEN LOVE TO BLAME DEMONS

247
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:30,012
WHEN THEIR GRAND PLANS
UNRAVEL.

248
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:32,806
IT IS MY BELIEF
THAT A MOMENT OF CHAOS

249
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,184
AFFORDS OPPORTUNITIES
LOST SOON AFTER.

250
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:38,270
YOU SAY THAT AS IF
YOU WERE THE FIRST MAN
ALIVE TO THINK IT.

251
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:41,607
YES, A CRISIS
IS AN OPPORTUNITY.

252
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,151
WHAT OTHER BRILLIANT
INSIGHTS HAVE YOU
BROUGHT ME TODAY?

253
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,819
AFTER THE LANNISTERS
AND THE STARKS,

254
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:48,322
THE TYRELLS COMMAND
THE LARGEST HOST.

255
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:50,532
THEIR LANDS ARE THE MOST
FERTILE IN THE SEVEN KINGDOMS,

256
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:54,411
- FEEDING HORSES AND SOLDIERS.
- YES, YES, YES.

257
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:58,749
THE TYRELLS HAVE
NOT YET DECLARED FOR ANY
OF THE SURVIVING KINGS.

258
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:02,044
LORAS WANTS REVENGE.
HE BLAMES STANNIS
FOR RENLY'S DEATH.

259
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,922
AND MARGAERY--

260
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,674
WANTS TO BE QUEEN.

261
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:09,593
YES, SHE DOES.

262
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:14,682
HOUSE TYRELL REBELLED
AGAINST THE IRON THRONE,

263
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:18,435
- AGAINST MY GRANDSON.
- THEY DID.

264
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,771
AND PERHAPS THAT TREASON
SHOULD BE PUNISHED

265
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:22,731
<i>ONE DAY,</i>

266
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:26,819
AFTER STANNIS
AND ROBB STARK
ARE DEFEATED.

267
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,115
MORE WINE FOR LORD BAELISH.

268
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:40,207
IF YOU WILL ALLOW
ME TO REPRESENT YOUR
FAMILY'S INTERESTS,

269
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,292
I BELIEVE THAT
AN ADVANTAGEOUS
AGREEMENT--

270
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:45,337
THE TYRELL HOST HAS
RETURNED TO HIGHGARDEN?

271
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,589
THEY HAVE.

272
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,508
PARDON, MY LORD.

273
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:51,343
IT'S ONLY WINE.

274
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:55,055
YOU WOULD RIDE
THERE YOURSELF?

275
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,932
TONIGHT, WITH YOUR LEAVE.

276
00:16:57,015 --> 00:16:59,059
I'LL HAVE AN ANSWER
BY NIGHTFALL.

277
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,936
THAT'LL BE ALL, GIRL.

278
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:08,318
WHAT ELSE?

279
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:10,320
ON YOUR SON
TYRION'S DIRECTIVE,

280
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:12,823
I MET WITH CATELYN STARK.

281
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:14,491
WHY?

282
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,994
Littlefinger:
<i>HE HAD AN INTERESTING</i>
<i>PROPOSAL FOR HER</i>

283
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:20,289
- CONCERNING HER DAUGHTERS.
- HMM.

284
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,111
- ( groans )
- ( shouting )

285
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:12,633
- A GIRL.
- A WILDLING.

286
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,052
WE COULD QUESTION HER.

287
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:17,012
YOU COULD.

288
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,931
SHE WON'T ANSWER.

289
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:22,351
I'VE KNOWN A WILDLING
TO BITE OFF HIS TONGUE
INSTEAD OF TALKING.

290
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:26,647
- WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
- YGRITTE.

291
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:29,733
SHE WAS REACHING FOR THIS AXE
WHEN YOU GOT TO HER.

292
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:33,362
GIVE HER HALF A CHANCE,
SHE'LL BURY IT IN YOUR FACE.

293
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:36,281
I GAVE YOU MY NAME.

294
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:39,993
I'M JON SNOW.

295
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,752
YOU OUGHT TO BURN
THEM YOU KILLED.

296
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:51,296
Qhorin:
<i>WE'D NEED A BIG</i>
<i>FIRE FOR THAT.</i>

297
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:55,467
TELL ME, YGRITTE,

298
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,553
WHY DO YOU WANT US
TO BUILD A BIG FIRE?

299
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:00,889
ARE THERE SOME MORE
FRIENDS IN THE AREA?

300
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:04,184
BURN THEM OR MAYBE YOU'LL
NEED THOSE SWORDS AGAIN.

301
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,728
OUR BOY HERE'S ALREADY
KILLED ONE DEAD MAN.

302
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,231
HE CAN DO IT AGAIN
IF HE HAS TO.

303
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,733
WHAT WAITS
BEYOND THE PASS?

304
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,902
- THE FREE FOLK.
- HOW MANY?

305
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,737
( chuckles )

306
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,656
HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS.

307
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:20,409
MORE THAN YOU'VE
EVER SEEN, CROW.

308
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:23,871
WHY COME TO THE MOUNTAINS?

309
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:26,832
WHAT'S IN THE FROSTFANGS
YOUR KING COULD WANT?

310
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,758
DO YOU MEAN TO MARCH
ON THE WALL?

311
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,933
DO YOU KNOW
WHO I AM, GIRL?

312
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,352
QHORIN HALFHAND.

313
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:48,979
TELL ME TRUE.

314
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:52,357
IF YOUR PEOPLE CAPTURED ME,

315
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,276
WOULD THEY TAKE ME PRISONER?

316
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,612
THEY'D TAKE YOUR HEAD
OFF YOUR SHOULDERS

317
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,780
IF THEY WAS FEELING KIND.

318
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,366
IF NOT,
THEY'D KILL YOU SLOW.

319
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,869
( sighs )

320
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:06,330
WE HAVE NO FOOD FOR HER.

321
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:08,624
CAN'T SPARE A MAN
TO WATCH HER.

322
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,960
CAN'T LET HER GO.
SHE'LL BRING MANCE RAYDER'S
ARMY DOWN ON US.

323
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,837
IT NEEDS TO BE DONE.

324
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:16,298
- WANT ME TO DO IT?
- NO.

325
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,926
NO, I'LL DO IT.

326
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,429
COME, BROTHERS.

327
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:24,556
WE'LL LEAVE HIM TO IT.

328
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,642
WE'LL MEET YOU
AT THE TOP.

329
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,226
DON'T TAKE TOO LONG.

330
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,020
WE'RE DEEP IN
THEIR COUNTRY NOW.

331
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:38,111
<i>( bird screeches )</i>

332
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:46,453
YOU NEVER KILLED
A WOMAN BEFORE, DID YOU?

333
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:49,206
YOU DON'T NEED
TO DO IT.

334
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:51,583
MANCE WOULD TAKE YOU.
I KNOW HE WOULD.

335
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,835
THERE'S SECRET WAYS.

336
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,172
THE CROWS WOULD
NEVER CATCH US.

337
00:20:57,255 --> 00:21:00,384
I'M AS MUCH A CROW
AS THEY ARE.

338
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:13,981
WILL YOU BURN ME...

339
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:15,774
AFTER?

340
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:18,318
CAN'T.

341
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:20,904
SOMEONE MIGHT
SEE THE SMOKE.

342
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,996
STRIKE HARD AND TRUE,

343

JON SNOW,

344
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,792
OR I'LL COME BACK
AND HAUNT YOU.

345
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:40,757
THAT'S COLD.

346
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,261
GO ON.

347
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:46,596
BE QUICK ABOUT IT.

00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:55,313
DO IT.

349
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,527

355
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:19,189
YOU CAN'T DO IT.
WE BOTH KNOW IT.

356

THE SUN'S GOING
DOWN, JON SNOW.

YOU SOUND LIKE
A LITTLE CAT MEWLING
FOR HIS MOTHER.

377
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:43,815
PRINCES DON'T CRY.

378

- I SAW YOU CRY.
- DID YOU SAY SOMETHING,
MY LADY?

379
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:49,946

SO?

381
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:53,241
IT SEEMS A NORMAL THING.

IS YOUR LITTLE BROTHER
A PRINCE?

383

NO.

384
00:24:57,495 --> 00:24:59,873
NOT REALLY RELEVANT,
THEN, IS IT?

385
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:05,795

WE'VE EVER BEEN CURSED WITH
A VICIOUS IDIOT FOR A KING.

IF SHE DIES, YOU'LL NEVER
GET YOUR UNCLE JAIME BACK.

464
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,939
THE LITTLE BIRD'S
BLEEDING.

<i>SEE TO THAT CUT.</i>

467
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:40,236
WELL DONE, CLEGANE.

468
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:43,239
I DIDN'T DO IT FOR YOU.

469
00:29:44,782 --> 00:29:46,534
HE SHOULDN'T
MAKE ME WAIT.

470
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:51,122
THE SPICE KING IS
THE SECOND WEALTHIEST
MAN IN QARTH.

471
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:53,208
HE MAKES EVERYONE WAIT.

472
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:56,586
OF COURSE, YOU COULD HAVE
AVOIDED THIS EMBARRASSMENT

473
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:59,047
IF YOU MARRIED
THE WEALTHIEST MAN IN QARTH.

474
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,049
I ALREADY HAVE A HUSBAND.

475

KHAL DROGO IS GONE,
KHALEESI.

476
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:07,222
YOU ARE FAR TOO YOUNG
TO BE A WIDOW FOREVER

477
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:09,641
AND FAR TOO BEAUTIFUL.

478
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:11,559
AND YOU ARE FAR TOO SMART

479
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:14,938
TO THINK THAT I WILL
SUCCUMB TO FLATTERY.

480
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:16,981
I HAVE TRAVELLED
VERY FAR IN MY LIFE

481
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:18,566
AND MET MANY WOMEN,

482
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,401
BUT NONE THAT ARE
IMMUNE TO FLATTERY.

483
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:23,154
-<i> THE MOTHER OF DRAGONS!</i>
<i>- AH.</i>

FORGIVE ME.
I HAD TERRIBLE
DREAMS LAST NIGHT.

486
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:30,662
TERRIBLE DREAMS.

487
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:33,790
I COULD NOT SLEEP
UNTIL THE SUN WAS SHINING

488
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:36,209
AND THE BIRDS WERE SINGING.

489
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:39,087
<i>LOOK WHAT A BEAUTY YOU ARE</i>

490
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,589
<i>NOW THE RED WASTE</i>
<i>HAS BEEN WASHED OFF YOU.</i>

491

I AM SORRY ABOUT
ALL THAT UNPLEASANTNESS.

492
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:49,681
THE SILVER HAIR
OF A TRUE TARGARYEN.

493
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:52,976
XARO XHOAN DAXOS,
SHE IS FAR TOO LOVELY

494
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:55,687
FOR A GLORIFIED
DOCKWORKER LIKE YOURSELF.

495
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:59,190
VERY TRUE, AND YET THEY SAY
THAT YOUR GRANDFATHER,

496
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:01,276
WHO SOLD PEPPER
OFF THE BACK OF A WAGON,

497
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:04,737
MARRIED A LADY FAR LOVELIER
AND HIGHER BORN THAN HIMSELF.

498
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:07,031
EVERY LADY ALIVE
WAS LOVELIER

499
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:09,409
AND HIGHER BORN
THAN MY GRANDFATHER.

500
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:11,119
- ( laughs )
- Daenerys:<i> AHEM.</i>

501
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:14,664
DID MY SERVANTS NOT
OFFER YOU SOMETHING
TO EAT, TO DRINK?

502
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:16,583
I'LL HAVE THEM FLOGGED
IN THE SQUARE.

503
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:18,751
THANK YOU, MY LORD.
YOU ARE A GRACIOUS HOST,

504
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:21,754
BUT THERE IS NO SERVANT ALIVE
THAT CAN BRING ME WHAT I WANT.

505
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:24,507
OH, SHE HAS A TALENT
FOR DRAMA, THIS ONE.

506
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:28,636
SO, MY LITTLE PRINCESS,
WHAT IS IT YOU WANT?

507
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,096
MY BIRTHRIGHT--

508
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:31,931
THE SEVEN KINGDOMS
OF WESTEROS.

509
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:34,601
I FEAR I'M NO BETTER THAN
A SERVANT IN THIS REGARD.

510
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:36,769
I CANNOT GIVE YOU
WHAT I DO NOT HAVE.

511
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:39,314
I'M NOT ASKING YOU
FOR THE KINGDOMS.

512
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:41,316
I'M ASKING YOU
FOR SHIPS.

513
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:42,984
I NEED TO CROSS
THE NARROW SEA.

514
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:44,819
I NEED MY SHIPS AS WELL.

515
00:31:44,902 --> 00:31:46,362
I USE THEM, YOU SEE,

516
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:48,698
TO BRING SPICES FROM
ONE PORT TO ANOTHER.

517
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:50,325
WHATEVER YOU GRANT ME
NOW WILL BE REPAID

518
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:53,077
THREE TIMES OVER WHEN
I RETAKE THE IRON THRONE.

519
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:54,495
RETAKE?

520
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,706
DID YOU ONCE SIT
ON THE IRON THRONE?

521
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:59,500
MY FATHER SAT THERE
BEFORE HE WAS MURDERED.

522
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:02,086
BUT IF YOU DID NOT
SIT ON IT YOURSELF,

523
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:05,715
WOULD IT NOT BE CORRECT
TO SAY TAKE THE IRON THRONE?

524
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:07,800
I DIDN'T COME HERE
TO ARGUE GRAMMAR.

525
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:10,511
OF COURSE NOT.
YOU CAME TO TAKE MY SHIPS.

526
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:13,306
SO LET ME EXPLAIN
MY POSITION,

527
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:15,099
LITTLE PRINCESS.

528
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:18,603
UNLIKE YOU, I DO NOT
HAVE EXALTED ANCESTORS.

529
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:20,772
I MAKE MY LIVING BY TRADE.

530
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:24,067
AND I JUDGE EVERY TRADE
ON ITS MERITS.

531
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,568
YOU ASK FOR SHIPS.

532
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:28,863
YOU SAY I SHALL BE
REPAID TRIPLE.

533
00:32:28,946 --> 00:32:31,449
I DO NOT DOUBT YOUR HONESTY
OR YOUR INTENTIONS.

534
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:33,785
BUT BEFORE YOU
REPAY YOUR DEBTS,

535
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:36,579
YOU MUST SEIZE
THE SEVEN KINGDOMS.

536
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:39,290
- DO YOU HAVE AN ARMY?
- NOT YET.

537
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:40,833
YOU DO NOT HAVE AN ARMY.

538
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:42,710
DO YOU HAVE POWERFUL
ALLIES IN WESTEROS?

539
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:45,004
THERE ARE MANY THERE
THAT SUPPORT MY CLAIM.

540
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:47,256
WHEN WERE YOU
THERE LAST?

541
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,800
I LEFT WHEN
I WAS A BABY.

542
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:51,844
SO, IN TRUTH,
YOU HAVE NO ALLIES.

543
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:56,224
THE PEOPLE WILL RISE
TO FIGHT FOR THEIR RIGHTFUL
QUEEN WHEN I RETURN.

544
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,226
AH.

545
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:00,144
FORGIVE ME,
LITTLE PRINCESS,

546
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:03,439
BUT I CANNOT MAKE
AN INVESTMENT BASED
ON WISHES AND DREAMS.

547
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:04,941
NOW IF YOU'LL PARDON ME.

548
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:07,735
DO YOU KNOW ILLYRIO MOPATIS,
MAGISTER OF PENTOS?

549
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:10,446
YES, WE'VE MET.
A SHREWD MAN.

550
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:14,033
FOR MY WEDDING HE GAVE ME
THREE PETRIFIED DRAGON EGGS.

551
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:16,911
<i>HE BELIEVED--</i>
<i>THE WORLD BELIEVED--</i>

552
00:33:16,994 --> 00:33:18,746
THAT THE AGES
HAD TURNED THEM TO STONE.

553
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:22,166
HOW MANY CENTURIES HAS IT BEEN
SINCE DRAGONS ROAMED THE SKIES?

554
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:25,169
BUT I DREAMT THAT
IF I CARRIED THOSE EGGS

555
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:27,672
INTO A GREAT FIRE,
THEY WOULD HATCH.

556
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:32,301
WHEN I STEPPED INTO
THE FIRE, MY OWN PEOPLE
THOUGHT I WAS MAD.

557
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,387
BUT WHEN THE FIRE
BURNED OUT,

558
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,639
I WAS UNHURT,

559
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:39,642
THE MOTHER OF DRAGONS.

560
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:44,731
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

561
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:49,485
I'M NO ORDINARY WOMAN.

562
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:52,655
MY DREAMS COME TRUE.

563
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:59,746
I ADMIRE YOUR PASSION.

564
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:04,250
BUT IN BUSINESS, I TRUST
IN LOGIC, NOT PASSION.

565
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:06,085
I'M SORRY, LITTLE PRINCESS.

566
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:08,463
I AM NOT
YOUR LITTLE PRINCESS.

567
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:11,340
I AM DAENERYS STORMBORN
OF THE BLOOD OF OLD VALYRIA

568
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:13,384
AND I WILL TAKE
WHAT IS MINE.

569
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:16,554
WITH FIRE AND BLOOD,
I WILL TAKE IT.

570
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:20,308
YES, MY LADY,
BUT NOT WITH MY SHIPS.

571
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:41,829
WHO TAUGHT YOU TO READ?

572
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:44,040
MY FATHER, MY LORD.

573
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:46,167
HMM.

574
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,419
I TAUGHT MY SON
JAIME TO READ.

575
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,673
THE MAESTER CAME
TO ME ONE DAY,

576
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:54,842
TOLD ME HE WASN'T LEARNING.

577
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:57,678
HE COULDN'T MAKE SENSE
OF THE LETTERS.

578
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:00,473
HE REVERSED THEM
IN HIS HEAD.

579
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:03,476
THE MAESTER SAID HE'D HEARD
TELL OF THIS AFFLICTION

580
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:05,436
AND THAT WE SIMPLY
MUST ACCEPT IT.

581
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,438
HA!

582
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:11,025
AFTER THAT,
I SAT JAIME DOWN

583
00:35:11,108 --> 00:35:14,278
FOR FOUR HOURS EVERY DAY
UNTIL HE LEARNED.

584
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:19,450
HE HATED ME FOR IT,
FOR A TIME.

585
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:22,286
FOR A LONG TIME,

586
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,996
BUT HE LEARNED.

587
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:31,671
WHERE IS YOUR FATHER?
IS HE ALIVE?

588
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,175
WHO WAS HE?

589
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:38,886
A STONEMASON.

590
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,305
A STONEMASON
WHO COULD READ?

591
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:43,683
- HMM.
- HE TAUGHT HIMSELF.

592
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:46,519
QUITE A MAN.

593
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,689
WHAT KILLED HIM?

594
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:53,609
LOYALTY.

595
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,946
YOU'RE A SHARP
LITTLE THING, AREN'T YOU?

596
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:01,909
DID...

597
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:07,081
FORGIVE ME, MY LORD.
I SHOULDN'T ASK QUESTIONS.

598
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,251
NO...

599
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:13,337
BUT YOU'VE ALREADY BEGUN.

600
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:16,841
DID YOU KNOW
YOUR FATHER, MY LORD?

601
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:18,885
I DID.

602
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:22,513
I GREW UP WITH HIM.

603
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:27,351
I WATCHED HIM
GROW OLD.

604
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,106
<i>HE LOVED US.</i>

605
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:35,192
HE WAS A GOOD MAN,

606
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:37,695
BUT A WEAK MAN,

607
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:41,407
A WEAK MAN
WHO NEARLY DESTROYED
OUR HOUSE AND NAME.

608
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,661
I'M COLD.

609
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:48,497
I'LL FETCH MORE WOOD
FOR THE FIRE, MY LORD.

610
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:50,833
MMM.

611
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,880
( horse whinnies )

612
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:17,276
( grunts )

613
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,153
WHERE ARE YOU GOING, GIRL?

614
00:37:19,236 --> 00:37:21,989
THE ARMORY,
MY LORD.

615
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:23,658
WHY?

616
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:25,660
LORD TYWIN SENT ME.

617
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:29,789
WHAT MIGHT THIS BE?

618
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:32,792
LORD TYWIN GAVE IT TO ME.

619
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:34,835
WHAT FOR?

620
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:37,672
TO TAKE TO THE ARMORY.

621
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:40,257
WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?

622
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:43,844
LET'S GO AND ASK HIM.

623
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:48,975
MOVE!

624
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:52,937
GET OUT OF THE WAY!

625
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:09,328
( men chatting )

626
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:24,385
AMORY LORCH.

627
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,429
A GIRL HAS NAMED
A SECOND NAME.

628
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:28,055
A MAN WILL DO
WHAT MUST BE DONE.

629
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,974
NOW!

630
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:33,894
A GIRL CANNOT TELL
A MAN WHEN EXACTLY
HE MUST DO A THING.

631
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:36,063
A MAN CANNOT
MAKE A THING HAPPEN
BEFORE ITS TIME.

632
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,065
BUT HE'S GOING TO TELL TYWIN.
HE'S GETTING AWAY.

633
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:41,110
- IT HAS TO BE NOW.
- ( sighs )

634
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:50,453
GUARD!

635
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:57,043
<i>( horse whinnies )</i>

636
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:02,048
- YOUR GRACE.
- YOUR GRACE.

637
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:08,429
MY HONOR, YOUR GRACE.

638
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:10,890
YOUR GRACE.

639
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:18,647
- YOUR GRACE.
- QUENT.

640
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:41,754
LADY TALISA.

641
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:44,507
YOUR GRACE.

642
00:39:45,674 --> 00:39:47,510
I'M NOT SURE I'M A LADY.

643
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:49,512
WESTEROSI CUSTOMS ARE STILL
A BIT FOREIGN TO ME.

644
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:52,139
IT'S HARD TO KEEP
ALL THE RULES STRAIGHT.

645
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:55,226
BUT IF I REMEMBER
MY LESSONS,

646
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:57,728
A WOMAN OF NOBLE BIRTH
IS ALWAYS CALLED A LADY

647
00:39:57,812 --> 00:40:00,397
UNLESS SHE'S A QUEEN
OR A PRINCESS.

648
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:02,650
I COULD FIND
SOMEONE WHO KNOWS.

649
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:05,236
WHY ARE YOU SO SURE
I'M OF NOBLE BIRTH?

650
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:07,154
BECAUSE IT'S OBVIOUS.

651
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:10,991
WHAT IF I TOLD YOU MY FATHER
SOLD LACE ON THE LONG BRIDGE

652
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:13,786
AND MY MOTHER,
MY BROTHER, AND I LIVED
WITH HIM ABOVE OUR SHOP?

653
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:17,039
I'D CALL YOU A LIAR.

654
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:20,376
NOT VERY NOBLE TO ACCUSE
A LADY OF DISHONESTY.

655
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,132
I ALWAYS THOUGHT
I WAS A BRILLIANT LIAR.

656
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:29,635
BETTER AT AMPUTATIONS,
I'M AFRAID.

657
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:36,267
QUITE A PRETTY SPOT.

658
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:38,978
WILL WE BE HERE LONG?

659
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:41,856
I COULDN'T REALLY DISCUSS
TROOP MOVEMENTS WITH YOU.

660
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:44,316
I'M NOT A SPY.

661
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,362
OF COURSE A SPY
WOULD DENY BEING A SPY.

662
00:40:48,445 --> 00:40:51,031
YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU'VE FOUND ME OUT.

663
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,741
I'M WRITING A LETTER
TO THE LANNISTERS.

664
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:55,327
"THE YOUNG WOLF
IS ON THE MOVE."

665
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:59,081
PERHAPS YOU'D JOIN ME...

666
00:41:00,457 --> 00:41:03,210
IF YOU'VE GOT TIME,
OF COURSE, FOR, WELL...

667
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:05,462
ROBB.

668
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:08,841
MOTHER.

669
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:17,391
MOTHER, THIS IS
LADY TALISA.

670
00:41:17,474 --> 00:41:19,810
SHE'S BEEN HELPING
WITH THE WOUNDED.

671
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:22,813
SHE'S BEEN VERY...
HELPFUL.

672
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,273
LADY TALISA.

673
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:25,900
LADY STARK.

674
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:27,943
LADY TALISA...?

675
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:31,363
- MAEGYR.
- MAEGYR?

676
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:34,325
FORGIVE ME,
I DO NOT KNOW THIS NAME.

677
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:37,453
AN UNCOMMON NAME HERE.
AN OLD NAME IN VOLANTIS.

678
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:41,707
EXCUSE ME, MY LADY.
YOUR GRACE.

679
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:52,259
I'VE MISSED YOU.

680
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:55,596
YES, YOU LOOK
POSITIVELY FORLORN.

681
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:58,432
YOU SURPRISED ME,
THAT'S ALL.

682
00:41:58,515 --> 00:42:01,852
I DIDN'T THINK
I'D SEE YOU TODAY.

683
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:04,104
I WISH THAT YOU WERE FREE
TO FOLLOW YOUR HEART.

684
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:05,773
I KNOW.

685
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:08,442
YOU HAVE INHERITED YOUR
FATHER'S RESPONSIBILITIES.

686
00:42:08,525 --> 00:42:11,195
I'M AFRAID THEY COME
AT A COST.

687
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:15,449
- I KNOW.
- YOU ARE PROMISED
TO ANOTHER--

688
00:42:15,532 --> 00:42:19,161
A DEBT THAT MUST BE PAID.

689
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:21,455
- I HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN.
- YOUR GRACE.

690
00:42:21,538 --> 00:42:25,251
MY LADY.
NEWS FROM WINTERFELL.

691
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:27,336
( wind howling )

692
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:40,391
YOUR BROTHERS DESERT YOU?

693
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:42,810
I CAN TELL YOU
WHICH WAY TO GO.

694
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:45,521
WE'LL STOP HERE.

695
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:47,564
TOO DARK TO GO
ANY FARTHER TODAY.

696
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:50,484
HERE? THERE'S NO
SHELTER HERE.

697
00:42:50,567 --> 00:42:51,819
THERE'S NO SHELTER
ANYWHERE.

698
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:54,697
THERE IS IF YOU KNOW
WHERE TO LOOK.

699
00:42:58,075 --> 00:42:59,952
THE COLD
COULD KILL US BOTH.

700
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:02,162
- IF YOU LIGHT A FIRE--
- NO FIRE.

701
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:04,873
- BUT A FIRE IS--
- NO FIRE.

702
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:09,670
HAVE IT YOUR WAY.

703
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:19,054
WE'LL STAY WARMER
IF WE STAY CLOSE.

704
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:23,892
BET YOU FREEZE TO DEATH
BEFORE I DO.

705
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:27,563
BET YOUR LIFE.

706
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:54,465
THINK THEY'RE OUT
LOOKING FOR YOU?

707
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:58,594
- YES.
- THINK THEY'LL FIND YOU?

708
00:43:58,677 --> 00:44:00,804
YES.

709
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,726
YOU'RE BRAVE.

710
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:08,437
STUPID,

711
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,481
BUT BRAVE.

712
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:16,528
WE START AGAIN
AT FIRST LIGHT.
GET SOME SLEEP.

713
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:34,296
STOP MOVING.

714
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:38,092
I'M JUST TRYING
TO GET COMFORTABLE.

715
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:39,802
STOP IT!

716
00:44:51,688 --> 00:44:54,108
-<i> YOU'RE STILL MOVING.</i>
<i>- WAS I?</i>

717
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:56,860
I DIDN'T NOTICE
THAT TIME.

718
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:10,082
THIS CANNOT BE TRUE.

719
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:11,875
Bolton:
<i>WE'VE HAD RAVENS</i>
<i>FROM WHITE HARBOR,</i>

720
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:14,169
BARROWTON
AND THE DREADFORT.

721
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:16,630
I'M AFRAID IT IS TRUE.

722
00:45:16,713 --> 00:45:18,507
WHY?
WHY WOULD THEON--

723
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:20,801
BECAUSE THE GREYJOYS
ARE TREASONOUS WHORES.

724
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:23,637
-<i> MY BROTHERS?</i>
<i>- WE'VE HEARD NOTHING OF THEM.</i>

725
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:25,472
( sighs )

726
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:27,808
BUT RODRIK CASSEL IS DEAD.

727
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:32,438
I TOLD YOU,
NEVER TRUST A GREYJOY!

728
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:38,026
I MUST GO NORTH AT ONCE.

729
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:40,154
THERE'S STILL A WAR
TO WIN, YOUR GRACE.

730
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:42,781
HOW CAN I CALL MYSELF KING
IF I CAN'T HOLD MY OWN CASTLE?

731
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:45,826
- HOW CAN I ASK MEN
TO FOLLOW ME IF I CAN'T--
- YOU ARE A KING.

732
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:48,787
AND THAT MEANS YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DO EVERYTHING YOURSELF.

733
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:50,497
LET ME GO
AND TALK TO THEON.

734
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:53,667
THERE WILL BE NO TALK.
HE WILL DIE FOR THIS.

735
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:56,837
THEON HOLDS THE CASTLE
WITH A SKELETON CREW.

736
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,131
LET ME SEND WORD TO
MY BASTARD AT THE DREADFORT.

737
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:03,469
HE CAN RAISE A FEW HUNDRED
MEN AND RETAKE WINTERFELL
BEFORE THE NEW MOON.

738
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:06,722
WE HAVE THE LANNISTERS
ON THE RUN.

739
00:46:06,805 --> 00:46:11,310
IF YOU MARCH ALL THE WAY
BACK NORTH NOW, YOU'LL
LOSE WHAT YOU GAINED.

740
00:46:11,393 --> 00:46:14,938
MY BOY WOULD BE
HONORED TO BRING YOU
PRINCE THEON'S HEAD.

741
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:19,526
TELL YOUR SON
BRAN AND RICKON'S
SAFETY IS PARAMOUNT.

742
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:23,947
AND THEON-- I WANT HIM
BROUGHT TO ME ALIVE.

743
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:26,366
I WANT TO LOOK HIM
IN THE EYE AND ASK HIM WHY.

744
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:28,994
AND THEN I'LL TAKE
HIS HEAD MYSELF.

745
00:46:29,077 --> 00:46:32,915
WHY ON EARTH WOULD I TRUST
THE WORD OF A LYING LITTLE
SAVAGE LIKE YOU?

746
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:34,958
I'M NO LIAR.

747
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:38,045
ALL WILDLINGS
ARE LIARS AND SAVAGES

748
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:39,880
WITH NO LOYALTY
TO ANYTHING OR ANYONE.

749
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:42,382
I DONE WHAT I HAD
TO DO TO STAY ALIVE.

750
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:45,260
I HATE THE STARKS
AS WELL AS YOU DO.

751
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:48,597
LET ME SERVE YOU,
MY LORD.

752
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:51,225
HOW? AND DON'T TELL ME
TO PUT A SPEAR IN YOUR HAND.

753
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:53,810
THERE ARE OTHER WAYS
TO SERVE, MY LORD.

754
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:56,271
I'M A PRINCE NOW,
AND YOU'D DO WELL--

755
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:59,316
THERE ARE OTHER WAYS
TO SERVE, MY PRINCE.

756
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:01,944
( chuckles )

757
00:47:04,029 --> 00:47:05,656
LIKE WHAT?

758
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:10,744
WE KNOW THINGS,
THE FREE PEOPLE.

759
00:47:10,827 --> 00:47:13,247
YOU KNOW THINGS?

760
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:15,082
LIKE WHAT?

761
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:17,459
HOW TO EAT DIRT?
( laughs )

762
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:20,462
( scoffs )
OTHER THINGS.

763
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:24,424
SAVAGE THINGS.

764
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:28,470
WAIT OUTSIDE.

765
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:47,447
I ALWAYS WONDERED
WHAT YOU HAD UNDER THERE.

766
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:50,409
IT COMES AT A PRICE.

767
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:52,911
I'M NOT KILLING YOU.
THAT'S YOUR PRICE.

768
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:54,538
I ALREADY HAD THAT.

769
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:57,291
WHAT DO YOU WANT, THEN,

770
00:47:57,374 --> 00:48:00,168
OTHER THAN
YOUR MISERABLE LIFE?

771
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:02,212
WHAT ALL FREE PEOPLE WANT--

772
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:04,548
MY FREEDOM.

773
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:11,221
WELL, YOU SHALL
HAVE IT, THEN.

774
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:16,059
BUT ONLY IF YOU
SERVE ME WELL.

775
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:23,734
- OW.
- SHH.

776
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:27,029
- IT'S NOT DEEP.
- I THOUGHT THEY WERE
GOING TO KILL ME.

777
00:48:27,112 --> 00:48:28,405
THEY THOUGHT SO, TOO.

778
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:31,283
HE HATED ME,
THE MAN WHO HIT ME.

779
00:48:31,366 --> 00:48:33,827
I SAW IT IN HIS EYES.
HATED ME.

780
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:35,579
HE NEVER MET ME BEFORE,

781
00:48:35,662 --> 00:48:38,707
BUT HE WANTED
TO HURT ME.

782
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:41,668
- OF COURSE HE DID.
- WHY? WHY WOULD A STRANGER--

783
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:44,004
YOU ARE EVERYTHING
HE WILL NEVER HAVE.

784
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:46,256
YOUR HORSE EATS BETTER
THAN HIS CHILDREN.

785
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:49,426
IT DOESN'T MATTER NOW.
HE'S DEAD.

786
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:52,554
I WOULD HAVE GIVEN THEM
BREAD IF I HAD IT.

787
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:55,182
I HATE THE KING
MORE THAN ANY OF THEM.

788
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:56,975
DON'T SAY THESE THINGS.

789
00:48:57,059 --> 00:48:58,352
IF THE WRONG
PEOPLE HEAR YOU--

790
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:00,729
BUT YOU'RE NOT
THE WRONG PEOPLE.

791
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:08,362
DON'T TRUST ANYBODY.

792
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:10,781
LIFE IS SAFER
THAT WAY.

793
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:42,479
( murmurs )

794
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:55,617
AND WHERE
ARE YOU GOING?

795
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:58,203
I HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU
FROM PRINCE THEON.

796
00:49:58,286 --> 00:50:01,206
- WHAT?
- ME.

797
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:06,461
HE SAYS I'M TO MAKE
THE ROUNDS.

798
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:15,011
AND KEEP YOU WARM.

799
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,686
( groans )

800
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:26,732
( whistles )

801
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:39,911
( panting )

802
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:45,125
THE SPICE KING REFUSES ME
BECAUSE I'M A BAD INVESTMENT.

803
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:48,962
THE SILK KING WON'T SUPPORT ME
BECAUSE OF HIS BUSINESS WITH
THE LANNISTERS.

804
00:50:49,045 --> 00:50:50,839
WHY OFFEND
HIS BEST CUSTOMER?

805
00:50:50,922 --> 00:50:54,301
AND THE COPPER KING
OFFERS ME A SINGLE SHIP

806
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:57,596
ON THE CONDITION THAT I LIE
WITH HIM FOR A NIGHT.

807
00:50:57,679 --> 00:51:00,640
DOES HE THINK I WILL
WHORE MYSELF FOR A BOAT?

808
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:04,269
WHEN I CAME TO THIS CITY,
I HAD NOTHING.

809
00:51:04,352 --> 00:51:06,897
TRULY NOTHING.

810
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,857
I SLEPT BY THE DOCKS.

811
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:11,735
AND WHEN I COULD FIND
WORK LOADING THE SHIPS,
I WOULD EAT.

812
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:14,780
IF NOT,
I DREAMED OF FOOD.

813
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:17,783
TODAY I AM THE RICHEST
MAN IN QARTH.

814
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:20,410
DO YOU THINK THE PATH
FROM POVERTY TO WEALTH

815
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:22,662
IS ALWAYS PURE
AND HONORABLE?

816
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:26,500
I HAVE DONE
MANY THINGS, KHALEESI,

817
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:28,919
THAT A RIGHTEOUS MAN
WOULD CONDEMN.

818
00:51:29,002 --> 00:51:32,631
AND HERE I AM,
WITH NO REGRETS.

819
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:49,105
BAR THE GATES.
RING THE BELLS.

820
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:51,525
SLOWLY, KHALEESI.

821
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:53,819
-<i> ( bells tolling )</i>
<i>- ( people shouting )</i>

822
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:03,578
<i>WHERE ARE THEY?</i>

823
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,712
WHERE ARE MY DRAGONS?!

824
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:20,929
<i>( dragons screeching )</i>

825
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:43,410
<i>( theme music playing )</i>
