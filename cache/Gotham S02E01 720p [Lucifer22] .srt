00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:33,044
(snoring quietly)

171
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:37,315
(snores)

172
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:39,450
(belching)

173
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:43,054
(men groaning
in disgust, coughing)

174
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:57,869
What did you say to Loeb?
Did you get mad?

175
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,905
Well, I disagreed
with his decision.

176
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:02,707
Come on.

177
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,742
You know I need the details.

178
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:06,611
I said I'd break him.

179
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:08,246
Words to that effect.

180
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:10,808
Hey, you went out
with a bang.

181
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:12,951
(heavy sigh)

182
00:09:12,953 --> 00:09:15,420
Maybe it's for the best.

183
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:20,058
That's what Loeb said.

184
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,560
I should have walked away.

185
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,597
I just hate to quit.

186
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:27,913
You didn't quit.

187
00:09:27,938 --> 00:09:30,705
You were fired.
What can you do?

188
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:32,937
Oh, there's things I can do.

189
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:36,641
I thought you said you didn't
have any legal moves left.

190
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:38,643
I don't.

191
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,348
You want to be
a cop so bad,

192
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,910
you're willing
to break the law?

193
00:09:45,935 --> 00:09:47,935
I'm willing
to bend it a little, yeah.

194
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:52,023
You're happy I got fired, huh?

195
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:54,626
You got me.

196
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:57,295
But only because

197
00:09:57,297 --> 00:09:59,857
I know that you'll
never quit.

198
00:09:59,882 --> 00:10:02,433
And I love that about you.

199
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,270
But they have you
directing traffic, Jim.

200
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:07,939
Why keep beating your
head against a wall.

201
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,275
I'm a cop, Lee.

202
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:14,412
I'm a cop.

203
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:16,915
(crows cawing,
dogs barking in distance)

204
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:18,616
(door rattles, clanks shut)

205
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:22,220
(whistling a tune)

206
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:24,223
Hi, gorgeous.

207
00:10:24,225 --> 00:10:25,390
I'm Jerome.

208
00:10:25,392 --> 00:10:26,925
Keep moving, ginger.

209
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:28,927
Just being polite.

210
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:30,728
So, what-cha in for?

211
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,397
Killing my parents.

212
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,533
Oh. Me, too.

213
00:10:35,535 --> 00:10:37,702
Well... Mom, anyhow.

214
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:40,672
Liberating, right?

215
00:10:40,674 --> 00:10:42,707
Oh... what a rush!

216
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:45,076
Yeah, all righty, then.

217
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:46,744
You see the big handsome fella

218
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:49,647
staring at you like
you're fried chicken?

219
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,349
Richard Sionis.

220
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:52,717
He's a millionaire.

221
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:54,085
Mm, got his own airplane.

222
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:56,788
Got a boat with
a hot tub on it.

223
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,489
And he killed 25 people...

224
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,411
(snorting laugh)
...just for fun.

225
00:11:00,436 --> 00:11:02,093
So what?

226
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:04,329
So... he likes you.

227
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:06,891
He wants to be
your friend.

228
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,167
Hmm. Let me think. No.

229
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:12,170
A girl needs
a good friend in here.

230
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:14,605
See, the guards,

231
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:15,673
they don't care.

232
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,235
They figure bad things
happen to bad people.

233
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,979
And they happen
all the time.

234
00:11:20,981 --> 00:11:23,748
All the time.

235
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,883
Hey, you.

236
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:27,118
Hello?

237
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,920
(whistles) Baldy!

238
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:30,588
Here, here. Hello, yes.

239
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,590
Hi. Come here.

240
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:44,135
Hi.

241
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:46,237
Hi.

242
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:47,739
My name is Barbara.

243
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:50,708
Would you be my friend?

244
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,709
Yes.

245
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,212
Hey, if someone here

246
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:55,480
tries to hurt me...

247
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,216
...would you protect me?

248
00:11:58,218 --> 00:11:59,250
Yes.

249
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:01,753
Thank you so much.

250
00:12:01,755 --> 00:12:02,820
(both chuckle)

251
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:04,789
Cutie. (chuckles)

252
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:10,728
Now I have a friend.

253
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,430
You're bad.

254
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:15,266
Yeah, so why don't you go
make me a sandwich.

255
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:18,002
Your friend is a gorilla.

256
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:20,571
My friend runs
the joint.

257
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:24,575
And he can get you things
that other people can't get you.

258
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:27,311
Things like what?

259
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:29,847
Anything you need.

260
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:32,450
I need a telephone.

261
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:39,424
Ogden Barker, in for 70 grand,

262
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:42,827
plus two months vig,
250 and change.

263
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:44,929
Says he owes Falcone.

264
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,097
Falcone's gone,

265
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,999
so his debt's forfeit.

266
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:50,361
Well, we can't have him
saying that.

267
00:12:50,386 --> 00:12:52,336
What if everybody started
saying that?

268
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:54,038
There'd be anarchy.

269
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,240
What is it?

270
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:57,809
(whispering)

271
00:12:57,811 --> 00:12:59,310
Oh.

272
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:01,646
Splendid.

273
00:13:01,648 --> 00:13:03,314
Jim!

274
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:05,516
Come on in!

275
00:13:12,092 --> 00:13:14,225
My dear old friend.

276
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:15,927
We need to talk.

277
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:19,864
Oh. Leave us.

278
00:13:25,105 --> 00:13:26,504
GORDON:
Hey, Selina.

279
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:28,906
Moving on up, huh?

280
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:30,074
Tryin'.

281
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:31,809
OSWALD:
Isn't she darling?

282
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,779
It's like having a cat
around the house.

283
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:37,715
But no horrid
dead mice.

284
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:41,519
I need a favor.

285
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:43,087
I figure you owe me one.

286
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:44,322
(scoffs)

287
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,457
I do?

288
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:49,894
I'm always happy to help you,
Jim, but I-I, I don't recall...

289
00:13:49,896 --> 00:13:51,062
The hospital.

290
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:52,430
I saved you from Maroni's men.

291
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:55,066
But I was only there
because you arrested me.

292
00:13:55,068 --> 00:13:56,801
For attempted murder.

293
00:13:56,803 --> 00:14:00,404
Remind me again
why I let you go.

294
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:02,406
Enlightened friendship.

295
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:05,309
I'd call us even,
but... (chuckles)

296
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,445
let's not quibble.

297
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:11,015
I'm so happy
you came to me for help, Jim.

298
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,416
The answer is yes.

299
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:14,585
Your wish is granted.

300
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:16,587
You don't know what it is yet.

301
00:14:17,924 --> 00:14:21,592
You want Loeb fired,
and your old job back, no?

302
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:24,662
Yes.

303
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:26,464
For a good friend like you,

304
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:28,933
it can be done.

305
00:14:28,935 --> 00:14:31,302
If you're sure
that's what you want.

306
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:33,304
I'm sure.

307
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:35,106
May I ask why?

308
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:38,976
Police work in Gotham
is such a thankless job.

309
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:40,945
Good pension.

310
00:14:40,947 --> 00:14:42,313
What does Lee think?

311
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:44,649
Who?

312
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:48,786
Are you gonna help me or not?

313
00:14:48,788 --> 00:14:50,054
Relax.

314
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,789
I already said I would help.

315
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,891
(chuckles)
He is so brusque,

316
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:54,892
isn't he?

317
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,174
(chuckles)

318
00:14:56,176 --> 00:14:57,241
No, thank you.

319
00:14:57,243 --> 00:14:59,530
Oh... while I think on it,

320
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:03,734
perhaps there's a small favor
you could do for me in return.

321
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,671
I know how you hate
to owe favors.

322
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:13,811
I am having a small business
dispute with a friend of mine.

323
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:15,713
Ogden Barker.

324
00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:17,815
You have
a persuasive personality.

325
00:15:17,817 --> 00:15:19,917
Perhaps you could talk to him.

326
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,858
You want me
to collect a debt for you?

327
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:32,263
I want you to prove to me that
our friendship is a real one,

328
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,899
based on trust and equity.

329
00:15:34,901 --> 00:15:36,500
That's fair.

330
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:40,671
No. Sorry.

331
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:41,793
Can't help you.

332
00:15:41,818 --> 00:15:44,408
Congratulations on
all your success.

333
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,244
Be good, Selina.

334
00:15:46,246 --> 00:15:47,545
Always.

335
00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:50,147
Don't say no now, Jim.

336
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:52,309
Sleep on it.
(door opens)

337
00:15:52,334 --> 00:15:53,834
(door shuts)

341
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:02,426
screw the GCPD,

342
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:03,861
and screw this city.

343
00:16:03,863 --> 00:16:06,964
Amen. You're doing the
right thing, brother.

344
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,699
Walk away, Jim,
just walk away.

345
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:09,967
You'd do
the same thing, right?

346
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,803
Me? I'd serve a sandwich
to Beelzebub,

347
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:13,871
but that's just me.

348
00:16:13,873 --> 00:16:15,273
You are a moralist.

349
00:16:15,275 --> 00:16:17,835
You could never
work for Penguin.

350
00:16:17,837 --> 00:16:19,837
The shame
would eat away at your guts.

351
00:16:19,862 --> 00:16:21,112
Yeah...

352
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:23,748
Yeah.

353
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,017
Ooh, slow down, slurpy.
Mm...

354
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:27,852
You're not joining me?

355
00:16:27,854 --> 00:16:30,721
I've been sober 32 days.

356
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:32,356
32 days, huh?

357
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:33,491
Eh, it's no biggie.

358
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:35,826
Once I quit the job,
quitting drinking was easy.

359
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,029
It's the job, Jim.

360
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:39,897
Makes us angry.
Makes us hard.

361
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:41,165
Yeah, it does.

362
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:43,534
It's hard to walk away,
but it can be done.

363
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:45,636
I just couldn't
carry that badge anymore.

364
00:16:45,638 --> 00:16:47,138
Look at me now.

365
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,006
Right? I'm sober...

366
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:52,009
I have a woman who
does not dislike me,

367
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,451
I live in a house,
I sleep at night.

368
00:16:54,476 --> 00:16:56,881
I've never been happier
in my life.

00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:17,034
Got to go.

375
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:27,819
ALFRED: I really am
most frightfully sorry

376
00:17:27,821 --> 00:17:29,620
it took so long
to answer the door, sir.

377
00:17:29,622 --> 00:17:30,715
Strange.

378

GORDON:
I walked.

380
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:37,041
You two are dirty.
What have you been doing?

381
00:17:37,066 --> 00:17:38,055
I imagine

382
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,091
you have something
important to say.

383
00:17:40,093 --> 00:17:41,892
Yes.

384
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,895
I've been fired from the GCPD.

385
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,330
I won't be able

386
00:17:46,332 --> 00:17:49,200
to keep the promise I made you.
I wanted to apologize.

387
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:51,282
Your apology's accepted,
of course, but...

388
00:17:51,284 --> 00:17:53,324
you didn't need
to walk here.

389
00:17:53,349 --> 00:17:55,673
A phone call
would've been fine.

390
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:58,175
I needed the air.
No hope

391
00:17:58,177 --> 00:18:00,878
for reinstatement then, sir?
No.

392
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:04,682
Well, there is a way, but...

393
00:18:04,684 --> 00:18:06,550
it's too ugly.

394
00:18:07,954 --> 00:18:10,074
I would have to collect a debt
for Penguin.

395
00:18:10,099 --> 00:18:11,789
To prove
our friendship.

396
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,657
Ah.

397
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:16,927
And you can't do
that, because...

398
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,063
he's a bad man.

399
00:18:19,065 --> 00:18:21,732
And the task would be demeaning.

400
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:23,534
Well, yes.

401
00:18:26,372 --> 00:18:28,973
You were going
to find my parents' killers.

402
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:31,842
You were going to
fight for justice.

403
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:33,844
You were going
to clean up the GCPD.

404
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:35,713
Change Gotham.

405
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:36,981
I had hoped to do that.

406
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:38,582
If you remained
at the GCPD,

407
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:39,950
you might still be able to do

408
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,912
all those good things,
but first...

409
00:18:41,937 --> 00:18:43,421
you must do something ugly.

410
00:18:43,423 --> 00:18:46,290
And your personal honor
forbids that.

411
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:47,658
Yes.

412
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:51,729
Are you not sacrificing
the greater good

413
00:18:51,731 --> 00:18:53,030
for the sake of your dignity

414
00:18:53,032 --> 00:18:55,866
and self-esteem?

415
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:57,548
For vanity?
Steady on, now,

He walked all the way here
to discuss the issue, Alfred.

419
00:19:02,498 --> 00:19:03,941
I'm simply asking
a question.

420
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:06,744
Surely, sometimes,
the right way

421
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:08,546
is also the ugly way.

422
00:19:08,548 --> 00:19:11,715
Sometimes a man can't take
the right way.

423
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:12,783
He's dealing with

424
00:19:12,785 --> 00:19:15,419
all kinds of business you can't
possibly understand yet,

425
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:16,921
because you're still a child.

426
00:19:16,923 --> 00:19:18,456
Yes, Alfred,

427
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:21,158
there is still a great deal
I don't understand yet.

428
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:25,088
Please forgive me
if I've offended you, Jim.

429
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:28,399
No, no.

430
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:30,668

Fertilizer? What is your game?
I would've thought

504
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:53,864
that's obvious
to a man of your perception.

505
00:23:57,036 --> 00:23:57,935
(sighs)

506
00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:00,437
It occurred to me
to follow my own advice.

507
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:03,273
Sometimes the ugly way
is also the right way.

508
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,555
I mean, a bomb,
inside the house?

509
00:24:04,557 --> 00:24:06,437
I mean, you're having a laugh,
ain't ya? A bomb?

510
00:24:06,462 --> 00:24:07,444
I was going to tell you.

511
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,526
I wanted to present it
as a fait accompli.

512
00:24:09,551 --> 00:24:12,182
Don't start
talking French to<i> me.</i>

513
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:13,484
You don't know
the first thing

514
00:24:13,486 --> 00:24:14,952
about bomb-making anyway,
do you?

515
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:17,114
I read a book, Alfred--
it seems simple enough.

516
00:24:17,139 --> 00:24:17,921
A book.

517
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:20,157
I mean, you're gonna
blow your bloody head off

518
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,159
before you put a dent
in that thing.

519
00:24:22,161 --> 00:24:25,162
You know, maybe that door's
trying to tell us something.

520
00:24:25,164 --> 00:24:28,866
Maybe you're not ready to
find out what's behind it.

521
00:24:28,868 --> 00:24:31,428
Maybe we should wait
until you're older.

522
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:32,710
I mean, who knows

523
00:24:32,735 --> 00:24:35,976
what your dear old dad
was up to down there, anyway.

524
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:42,880
Like what?

525
00:24:42,882 --> 00:24:46,083
Like things I wouldn't want...
to describe to a child,

526
00:24:46,085 --> 00:24:48,645
which is exactly
what you are.

527
00:24:50,189 --> 00:24:52,189
I'm building a bomb

528
00:24:52,191 --> 00:24:53,957
to blow down that door.

529
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:56,560
You may assist me...

530
00:24:56,562 --> 00:24:57,628
or not,

531
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:59,363
as you wish.
But i-if not,

532
00:24:59,365 --> 00:25:01,532
some tea would be nice.

533
00:25:01,534 --> 00:25:04,034
Right, well,
you're gonna need ten more...

534
00:25:04,036 --> 00:25:06,156
sacks of that gear,
for starters; three more

535
00:25:06,158 --> 00:25:08,718
dairy cans, too;
and extra timber; a...

536
00:25:08,743 --> 00:25:11,057
heavy tarpaulin.

537
00:25:12,111 --> 00:25:14,511
And I'll put the kettle on.

538
00:25:19,385 --> 00:25:22,319
(siren wailing in distance)

539
00:25:24,957 --> 00:25:26,824
Excellent.

540
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,159
Excellent.

541
00:25:29,161 --> 00:25:31,495
I'm so sorry
things got messy.

542
00:25:31,497 --> 00:25:33,697
What a foolish fellow.

543
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:36,266
Never mind.
I will make sure that there's

544
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:38,702
no follow-up
from your colleagues.

545
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:40,170
Don't worry about a thing.

546
00:25:40,172 --> 00:25:41,505
You knew.

547
00:25:41,507 --> 00:25:44,141
You knew Ogden would go off.

548
00:25:44,143 --> 00:25:45,776
What a devious mind you have.

549
00:25:45,778 --> 00:25:46,910
I had no idea.

550
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:48,011
We have a deal.

551
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:49,880
We do.

552
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:51,481
We do.

553
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:04,494
You okay, Jim?

554
00:26:06,632 --> 00:26:09,433
(sighing):
Oh, yeah. Daydreaming.

555
00:26:09,435 --> 00:26:11,435
What's wrong?

556
00:26:11,437 --> 00:26:12,903
Nothing.

557
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,906
(phone ringing)

558
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:19,176
Hello.

559
00:26:19,178 --> 00:26:21,912
BARBARA:
Hello? Jim?

560
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:26,183
Hello? Are you still there?

561
00:26:26,185 --> 00:26:27,684
I'm here.

562
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:28,952
Hi.

563
00:26:28,954 --> 00:26:30,120
How are you?

564
00:26:30,122 --> 00:26:31,922
How did you get to a phone?

565
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:33,290
Who cares?

566
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:35,158
We're talking at last--

567
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,460
that's the important thing.

568
00:26:36,462 --> 00:26:37,761
What do you want?

569
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:41,298
(whispers): Jim, there's been
a terrible mistake.

570
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,933
I...

571
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:44,835
<i>never</i> told Lee

572
00:26:44,837 --> 00:26:47,170
that I killed my mom and dad.

573
00:26:47,172 --> 00:26:50,073
And I never attacked her.

574
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:51,775
She attacked<i> me,</i> Jim.

575
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:54,344
(trembling breath)
She's completely insane!

576
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:55,479
That's enough.

577
00:26:55,481 --> 00:26:57,214
Don't call again.

578
00:26:57,216 --> 00:26:58,615
Who was that?

579
00:27:01,487 --> 00:27:02,586
Sales call.

580
00:27:02,588 --> 00:27:03,854
They can drive you crazy, huh?

581
00:27:03,856 --> 00:27:05,756
Sales call?

582
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:08,091
(phone ringing)

583
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:10,093
(sighs)

584
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:12,329
(ringing continues)

585
00:27:12,331 --> 00:27:13,497
Don't.

586
00:27:13,499 --> 00:27:14,932
Wh-What?

587
00:27:14,934 --> 00:27:16,066
Don't answer it.

588
00:27:16,068 --> 00:27:18,028
Jim, you're scaring me.
It's Barbara.

589
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:20,203
LEE (recorded):
Go ahead and leave a message.

590
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:21,965
BARBARA:
Hey, girlfriend.

591
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:23,707
(chuckles):
Guess who.

592
00:27:23,709 --> 00:27:24,975
Sorry I missed you.

593
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:26,977
Bummer, eh?

594
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:28,378
I just wanted to say

595
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:31,014
that I hope
you die screaming, bitch.

596
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:31,856
(chuckles)

597
00:27:31,881 --> 00:27:34,017
(mockingly sweet):
Bye.

598
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:35,886
(hangs up, tone beeps)

599
00:27:35,888 --> 00:27:37,621
(answering machine clicks off)
Nice.

600
00:27:37,623 --> 00:27:38,855
All right, look...

601
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:40,777
she's safely locked up
at Arkham.

602
00:27:40,802 --> 00:27:42,025
She can't hurt you.

603
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:43,060
I know, I know.

604
00:27:43,062 --> 00:27:45,462
She's just
a sick person spreading sadness.

605
00:27:46,532 --> 00:27:48,498
Screw her.

606
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,780
Let's be happy.

607
00:27:49,805 --> 00:27:51,668
Let's go away someplace.

608
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,904
We can't let a crazy woman
drive us out.

609
00:27:53,906 --> 00:27:55,172
Why not?

610
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:57,674
Pride? Who cares?

611
00:27:57,676 --> 00:28:00,236
We could go away
and never come back.

612
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:02,227
What's keeping us here?

613
00:28:03,282 --> 00:28:05,282
I can't leave.

614
00:28:05,284 --> 00:28:06,750
Why not?

615
00:28:06,752 --> 00:28:08,618
Jim...

616
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,821
I did a bad thing.

617
00:28:15,461 --> 00:28:17,127
I did a bad thing.

618
00:28:20,666 --> 00:28:23,367
(siren wails in distance)

619
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:26,370
(door unlatches, creaks open)

620
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:28,872
(door closes)

621
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:34,644
(clattering in distance)

622
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:44,888
(thunder rumbles, crashes)

623
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,993
Hi.

624
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,467
Do you have
any peanut butter?

625
00:28:57,469 --> 00:29:00,029
(scoffs)
What?!

626
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:06,710
Peanut butter.

627
00:29:06,712 --> 00:29:08,712
Smooth, for preference.

628
00:29:08,714 --> 00:29:10,580
Guards, help!

629
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:11,782
Help!

630
00:29:15,554 --> 00:29:18,488
Oh, hi, boss.

631
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:22,292
How about a bottle of beer?

632
00:29:22,294 --> 00:29:24,027
(laughs)

633
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,407
(thunder crashes, rumbles)

634
00:29:37,409 --> 00:29:40,844
Let me share
a dilemma with you.

635
00:29:40,846 --> 00:29:43,080
May I?

636
00:29:45,084 --> 00:29:47,350
I need you to do
something for me

637
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:49,553
that I know
you won't want to do.

638
00:29:49,555 --> 00:29:51,021
What is it?

639
00:29:51,023 --> 00:29:54,157
With most people,
there's no problem.

640
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:57,360
I find their weak spots
and use violence

641
00:29:57,362 --> 00:30:00,630
or blackmail to
persuade them.

642
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,899
But you...

643
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:06,770
...you are a man
of monkish virtue.

644
00:30:06,772 --> 00:30:09,506
You have no vices
to expose.

645
00:30:09,508 --> 00:30:11,608
So threats of personal
violence will only

646
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:13,043
harden your resolve, huh?

647
00:30:13,045 --> 00:30:14,711
No, that...

648
00:30:14,713 --> 00:30:17,180
Come, sir, don't be modest.

649
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:21,351
You... are a rare animal.

650
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:25,989
But... that does lead us
to this sad pickle.

651
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:29,993
Since I can't persuade you
to do as I ask,

652
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:33,163
the only rational option
is to kill you

653
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:37,734
and negotiate with whomever
replaces you as commissioner.

654
00:30:37,736 --> 00:30:39,035
Now, chief?

655
00:30:39,905 --> 00:30:41,271
One moment, Victor.

656
00:30:41,273 --> 00:30:42,472
The commissioner
deserves time

657
00:30:42,474 --> 00:30:44,207
to process all this...

658
00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:47,277
say a prayer or what have you.

659
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,079
What do you want me to do?

660
00:30:49,081 --> 00:30:51,781
It's not worth talking about.

661
00:30:51,783 --> 00:30:53,517
You wouldn't do it.

662
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:55,051
Tell me.

663
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:01,558
I need my friend Jim Gordon
reinstated as a detective.

664
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,893
(scoffs)

665
00:31:02,895 --> 00:31:05,695
(giggling):
See? You hate that idea.

666
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:07,764
No, I'll... I'll do it.

667
00:31:07,766 --> 00:31:10,700
Mm-mm, I can tell
that you're not sincere.

668
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:13,570
Even if
you do as I ask,

669
00:31:13,572 --> 00:31:15,906
someday, down the line,

670
00:31:15,908 --> 00:31:19,376
you'll change your mind,
and you'll turn on him again.

671
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:21,978
Want me to kill him now?

672
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,940
No, make him
a nice cheese toastie.

673
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:25,315
Yes, kill him now, please.

674
00:31:25,317 --> 00:31:26,917
Just wanted to be clear.

675
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:28,185
No, wait!

676
00:31:28,187 --> 00:31:29,519
Let's talk about this.

677
00:31:29,521 --> 00:31:30,520
Sorry.

678
00:31:30,522 --> 00:31:31,788
Least worst option.

679
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:36,393
Unless, of course... uh...

680
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:38,094
No, you would never agree.

681
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:40,163
To what? Agree to what?!

COMPERE:
Lovely, lovely, bravo.

688
00:32:07,875 --> 00:32:10,627
Mayor James regrets
he's unable to attend today,

689
00:32:10,629 --> 00:32:13,630
but he's sent a dear friend
in his stead.

690
00:32:13,632 --> 00:32:16,700
Please welcome
distinguished businessman,

691
00:32:16,702 --> 00:32:21,037
visionary scientist,
acclaimed philanthropist

692
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,839
and new chairman of development

693
00:32:22,841 --> 00:32:27,177
at the Gotham Chamber
of Commerce, Mr. Theo Galavan.

694
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:29,145
(audience applauds)

695
00:32:33,352 --> 00:32:35,352
Thank you so much. Uh...

696
00:32:35,354 --> 00:32:37,621
What an honor it is
to be here today,

697
00:32:37,623 --> 00:32:41,057
to help bid farewell
to a great man

698
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:43,994
and a faithful servant
of this city.

699
00:32:43,996 --> 00:32:47,197
What can I say
about Gillian Loeb?

700
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,301
(sighs)

701
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:54,070
Someone tell me a funny story.

702
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:55,472
I have a good one.

703
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:57,474
So when I was in college,

704
00:32:57,476 --> 00:32:59,943
I played
for the varsity polo team

705
00:32:59,945 --> 00:33:02,178
and I had a...
a string of ponies.

706
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,547
Greetings!

707
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:05,949
I am Zaardon,

708
00:33:05,951 --> 00:33:08,518
the Soul Reaper.

709
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:11,121
So I had these ponies...

710
00:33:11,123 --> 00:33:13,890
I'm an adopted son
of this city.

711
00:33:13,892 --> 00:33:15,852
I haven't lived in Gotham
very long,

712
00:33:15,877 --> 00:33:19,663
but I already love her
like a native.

713
00:33:19,665 --> 00:33:20,964
It just...

714
00:33:20,966 --> 00:33:24,000
it just kind of
grabs hold of you,

715
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,835
doesn't it?

716
00:33:27,439 --> 00:33:29,973
There's magic here.

717
00:33:29,975 --> 00:33:31,341
Magic.

718
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:34,311
And that is down
to everyday heroes

719
00:33:34,313 --> 00:33:36,346
like Gillian Loeb.

720
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:38,381
Mr. Commissioner,

721
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:41,418
thank you
for your service.

722
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:54,297
Thank you very much, everybody.

723
00:33:56,168 --> 00:33:58,368
My best wishes to...

724
00:34:02,841 --> 00:34:04,441
...Commissioner Essen.

725
00:34:11,917 --> 00:34:15,852
...and the maître d' says,
"You can't bring them in here."

726
00:34:15,854 --> 00:34:17,020
Hear me, slaves.

727
00:34:17,022 --> 00:34:18,822
My patience is
wearing thin.

728
00:34:18,824 --> 00:34:21,424
Surrender your souls
to my mercy,

729
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:24,327
or I swear
by the master,

730
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:27,030
I shall feast
on your pain.

731
00:34:27,032 --> 00:34:29,899
I shall gorge
on your torment.

732
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:32,736
I shall crush you like a bug.

733
00:34:32,738 --> 00:34:34,337
(laughs, coughs)

734
00:34:34,339 --> 00:34:36,206
(gagging)

735
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,330
(alarm ringing)

736
00:35:00,332 --> 00:35:01,765
GUARD:
Backup to area five!

737
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:02,932
Area five!

738
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:10,407
(alarm continues ringing,
klaxon whooping)

739
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:18,848
ESSEN:
Welcome back, Jim.

740
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:22,085
I don't know how
you pulled this off,

741
00:35:22,087 --> 00:35:24,254
but I'm glad you did.

742
00:35:24,256 --> 00:35:26,756
He's a resourceful man.

743
00:35:26,758 --> 00:35:28,358
Congratulations,
to both of you.

744
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,760
Thank you.
And it is a new day, Jim.

745
00:35:30,762 --> 00:35:33,322
We're going to do
great things.

746
00:35:33,347 --> 00:35:34,680
Yes, we are.

747
00:35:35,834 --> 00:35:37,834
(whispers)

748
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,506
It is a new day.

749
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:46,976
Things are gonna be all right.
I promise.

750
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:49,112
I hope it was worth it.

751
00:35:49,114 --> 00:35:51,347
I hope so, too.

752
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:53,516
Jim...

753
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:55,185
What's wrong?

754
00:35:55,187 --> 00:35:57,787
There's been an incident.
At Arkham Asylum.

755
00:35:57,789 --> 00:36:00,349
Six inmates
have escaped.

756
00:36:00,374 --> 00:36:02,025
Barbara Kean was one of them.

757
00:36:02,027 --> 00:36:03,326
Oh, my God.

758
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:14,637
What the hell
is this place?

759
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:16,206
Ain't Arkham, anyhow.

760
00:36:16,208 --> 00:36:18,842
Things are looking up.

761
00:36:19,778 --> 00:36:21,544
Welcome, everyone.

762
00:36:23,248 --> 00:36:24,781
My name is Theo Galavan.

763
00:36:24,783 --> 00:36:25,982
This is my sister Tabitha.

764
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:27,544
(all clamoring)
Oh, my God,
look at that.

765
00:36:27,569 --> 00:36:29,152
Yeah, I got to get
my hands on that.

766
00:36:29,154 --> 00:36:30,434
(clamoring quiets)

767
00:36:30,459 --> 00:36:33,223
I understand.

768
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:36,092
You're feeling
confused, scared...

769
00:36:36,094 --> 00:36:38,394
a little groggy...
but please, relax.

770
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:40,630
Today is the first day

771
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:43,132
of a wonderful future
for all of you.

772
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:44,400
If you want it.

773
00:36:44,402 --> 00:36:45,802
Who are you?

774
00:36:45,804 --> 00:36:49,906
Well, now, the question is
who are you?

775
00:36:49,908 --> 00:36:51,674
The world

776
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:54,811
sees criminal lunatics.

777
00:36:54,813 --> 00:36:57,780
I see brilliance.

778
00:36:57,782 --> 00:37:00,149
I see charisma.

779
00:37:03,121 --> 00:37:04,821
And power.

780
00:37:06,291 --> 00:37:08,191
I see power.

781
00:37:08,193 --> 00:37:10,326
JEROME:
Yes.

782
00:37:10,328 --> 00:37:11,361
Exactly, my man.

783
00:37:11,363 --> 00:37:13,530
Oh, that is so spooky.

784
00:37:13,532 --> 00:37:14,831
That is me to a T.

785
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:17,700
These other bozos,
oh, I don't know, but...

786
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:20,003
you're singing my song.
Quiet,

787
00:37:20,005 --> 00:37:21,285
Jerome.

788
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:23,411
Keep talking.

789
00:37:25,677 --> 00:37:29,078
Imagine a group
of brilliant outlaws

790
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,713
like yourselves,

791
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:33,716
each selected
for their unique ability,

792
00:37:33,718 --> 00:37:35,752
all working together
as a team.

793
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:38,388
Imagine the synergy.

794
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:40,690
Imagine the impact.

795
00:37:40,692 --> 00:37:43,326
Gotham would tremble before you.

796
00:37:43,328 --> 00:37:45,888
BARBARA:
Well, that sounds

797
00:37:45,913 --> 00:37:50,433
fabulous, but I am not
a brilliant outlaw.

798
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:51,834
I just have...

799
00:37:51,836 --> 00:37:54,871
mm... issues.

800
00:37:54,873 --> 00:37:57,507
You have ferocity

801
00:37:57,509 --> 00:37:59,876
and beauty and desire

802
00:37:59,878 --> 00:38:02,412
and that's enough.

803
00:38:02,414 --> 00:38:04,881
Come with me, Barbara.

804
00:38:04,883 --> 00:38:07,884
Whatever you want
in the world,

805
00:38:07,886 --> 00:38:10,219
it's yours.

806
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:11,287
Theo?

807
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,849
That's your name,
right-- Theo?

808
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:16,192
You're getting way ahead
of yourself, here.

809
00:38:16,194 --> 00:38:19,395
First of all,
keep your hands off her.

810
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:22,665
Second,
this whole "magic team"?

811
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:24,534
I gotta pass.

812
00:38:24,536 --> 00:38:25,868
I don't take orders.

813
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:28,430
Good luck on
everything, though.

814
00:38:28,455 --> 00:38:30,656
It's an intriguing concept.

815
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:34,644
This is very disappointing.

816
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:36,646
Oh.

817
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:37,780
Fair play.

818
00:38:37,782 --> 00:38:39,682
You want a reward

819
00:38:39,684 --> 00:38:42,485
for busting us
out of Arkham.

820
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:43,886
I am grateful.

821
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:45,555
How's a million bucks sound?

822
00:38:45,557 --> 00:38:46,789
Pretty good, huh?

823
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:48,758
I can get it
for you today,

824
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,794
as soon as I hit the street.

825
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:53,630
Money's not the concern.

826
00:38:53,632 --> 00:38:56,933
Oh...
I had such high hopes for you.

827
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:00,296
I didn't anticipate
sexual jealousy.

828
00:39:00,321 --> 00:39:01,804
That always poisons the well.

829
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:03,906
You have to go.

830
00:39:03,908 --> 00:39:05,742
Tabitha
will see you out.

831
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:12,115
Miss Kean is coming with me.

832
00:39:12,117 --> 00:39:15,818
Oh, she doesn't want
to go where you're going.

833
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,720
(grunts, gags)

834
00:39:22,127 --> 00:39:23,292
(blade slicing)

835
00:39:23,294 --> 00:39:25,762
(laughs)

836
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:28,431
(gasping)

about this, Master Bruce?

I strongly advise...
Alfred.

Right, sir.
